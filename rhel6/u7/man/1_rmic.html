<p>Name rmic - The Java RMI Compiler</p>

<p>rmic generates stub, skeleton, and tie classes for
remote objects using either the JRMP or IIOP protocols. Also
generates OMG IDL.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rmic [ options ]
package-qualified-class-name(s)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The rmic compiler generates stub and
skeleton class files (JRMP proto- col) and stub and tie
class files (IIOP protocol) for remote objects. These
classes files are generated from compiled Java programming
lan- guage classes that are remote object implementation
classes. A remote implementation class is a class that
implements the interface java.rmi.Remote. The class names in
the rmic command must be for classes that have been compiled
successfully with the javac command and must be fully
package qualified. For example, running rmic on the class
file name HelloImpl as shown here:</p>

<p>rmic hello.HelloImpl</p>

<p>creates the HelloImpl_Stub.class file in the hello
subdirectory (named for the classs package).</p>

<p>A skeleton for a remote object is a JRMP protocol
server-side entity that has a method that dispatches calls
to the actual remote object implementation.</p>

<p>A tie for a remote object is a server-side entity
similar to a skele- ton, but which communicates with the
client using the IIOP protocol.</p>

<p>A stub is a client-side proxy for a remote object which
is responsible for communicating method invocations on
remote objects to the server where the actual remote object
implementation resides. A clients ref- erence to a remote
object, therefore, is actually a reference to a local
stub.</p>

<p>By default, rmic generates stub classes that use the 1.2
JRMP stub pro- tocol version only, as if the -v1.2 option
had been specified. (Note that the -vcompat option was the
default in releases prior to 5.0.) Use the -iiop option to
generate stub and tie classes for the IIOP proto- col.</p>

<p>A stub implements only the remote interfaces, not any
local interfaces that the remote object also implements.
Because a JRMP stub implements the same set of remote
interfaces as the remote object itself, a client can use the
Java programming languages built-in operators for casting
and type checking. For IIOP, the PortableRemoteObject.narrow
method must be used.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -bootclasspath path Overrides location of
bootstrap class files</p>

<p>-classpath path Specifies the path rmic uses to look up
classes. This option overrides the default or the CLASSPATH
environment variable if it is set. Directories are separated
by colons. Thus the general format for path is:</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>-d directory Specifies the root destination directory
for the generated class hierarchy. You can use this option
to specify a destination directory for the stub, skeleton,
and tie files. For example, the command</p>

<p>% rmic -d /java/classes foo.MyClass</p>

<p>would place the stub and skeleton classes derived from
MyClass into the directory /java/classes/foo. If the -d
option is not specified, the default behavior is as if
&quot;-d .&quot; were specified: the package hierarchy of
the target class is created in the cur- rent directory, and
stub/tie/skeleton files are placed within it. (Note that in
some previous versions of rmic, if -d was not spec- ified,
then the package hierarchy was not created, and all of the
output files were placed directly in the current
directory.)</p>

<p>-extdirs path Overrides location of installed
extensions</p>

<p>-g Enables generation of all debugging information,
including local variables. By default, only line number
information is generated.</p>

<p>-idl Causes rmic to generate OMG IDL for the classes
specified and any classes referenced. IDL provides a purely
declarative, program- ming language-independent way of
specifying an objects API. The IDL is used as a
specification for methods and data that can be written in
and invoked from any language that provides CORBA bindings.
This includes Java and C++ among others. See the Java
Language to IDL Mapping @
http://www.omg.org/technology/documents/formal/java_language_map-
ping_to_omg_idl.htm (OMG) document for a complete
description. When the -idl option is used, other options
also include:</p>

<p>-always or -alwaysgenerate Forces re-generation even
when existing stubs/ties/IDL are newer than the input
class.</p>

<p>-factory Uses factory keyword in generated IDL.</p>

<p>-idlModule fromJavaPackage[.class] toIDLModule Specifies
IDLEntity package mapping. For example: -idlModule foo.bar
my::real::idlmod.</p>

<p>-idlFile fromJavaPackage[.class] toIDLFile Specifies
IDLEntity file mapping. For example: -idlFile test.pkg.X
TEST16.idl.</p>

<p>-iiop Causes rmic to generate IIOP stub and tie classes,
rather than JRMP stub and skeleton classes. A stub class is
a local proxy for a remote object and is used by clients to
send calls to a server. Each remote interface requires a
stub class, which implements that remote interface. A client
s reference to a remote object is actually a reference to a
stub. Tie classes are used on the server side to process
incoming calls, and dispatch the calls to the proper
implementation class. Each implementation class requires a
tie class. Invoking rmic with the -iiop generates stubs and
ties that con- form to this naming convention:</p>

<p>_&lt;implementationName&gt;_stub.class
_&lt;interfaceName&gt;_tie.class</p>

<p>When the -iiop option is used, other options also
include:</p>

<p>-always or -alwaysgenerate Forces re-generation even
when existing stubs/ties/IDL are newer than the input
class.</p>

<p>-nolocalstubs Do not create stubs optimized for
same-process clients and servers.</p>

<p>-noValueMethods Must be used with the -idl option.
Prevents addition of value- type methods and initializers to
emitted IDL. These methods and initializers are optional for
valuetypes, and are gener- ated unless the -noValueMethods
option is specified when using the -idl option.</p>

<p>-poa Changes the inheritance from
org.omg.CORBA_2_3.portable.ObjectImpl to org.omg.Portable-
Server.Servant. The PortableServer module for the Portable
Object Adapter @ http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/tech-
notes/guides/idl/POA.html (POA) defines the native Servant
type. In the Java programming language, the Servant type is
mapped to the Java org.omg.PortableServer.Servant class. It
serves as the base class for all POA servant implementations
and provides a number of methods that may be invoked by the
application programmer, as well as methods which are invoked
by the POA itself and may be overridden by the user to
control aspects of servant behavior. Based on the OMG IDL to
Java Lan- guage Mapping Specification, CORBA V 2.3.1
ptc/00-01-08.pdf.</p>

<p>-J Used in conjunction with any java option, it passes
the option following the -J (no spaces between the -J and
the option) on to the java interpreter.</p>

<p>-keep or -keepgenerated Retains the generated .java
source files for the stub, skeleton, and/or tie classes and
writes them to the same directory as the .class files.</p>

<p>-nowarn Turns off warnings. If used the compiler does
not print out any warnings.</p>

<p>-nowrite Does not write compiled classes to the file
system.</p>

<p>-vcompat Generates stub and skeleton classes compatible
with both the 1.1 and 1.2 JRMP stub protocol versions. (This
option was the default in releases prior to 5.0.) The
generated stub classes will use the 1.1 stub protocol
version when loaded in a JDK 1.1 virtual machine and will
use the 1.2 stub protocol version when loaded into a 1.2 (or
later) virtual machine. The generated skeleton classes will
support both 1.1 and 1.2 stub protocol versions. The
generated classes are relatively large in order to support
both modes of operation.</p>

<p>-verbose Causes the compiler and linker to print out
messages about what classes are being compiled and what
class files are being loaded.</p>

<p>-v1.1 Generates stub and skeleton classes for the 1.1
JRMP stub proto- col version only. Note that this option is
only useful for gener- ating stub classes that are
serialization-compatible with pre-existing,
statically-deployed stub classes that were gener- ated by
the rmic tool from JDK 1.1 and that cannot be upgraded (and
dynamic class loading is not being used).</p>

<p>-v1.2 (default) Generates stub classes for the 1.2 JRMP
stub protocol version only. No skeleton classes are
generated with this option because skeleton classes are not
used with the 1.2 stub protocol version. The generated stub
classes will not work if they are loaded into a JDK 1.1
virtual machine.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES CLASSPATH Used to provide the
system a path to user-defined classes. Direc- tories are
separated by colons. For example,</p>

<p>SEE ALSO java(1), javac(1), CLASSPATH @

path</p>
