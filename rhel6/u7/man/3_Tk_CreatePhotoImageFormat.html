<p>NAME Tk_CreatePhotoImageFormat - define new file format
for photo images</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tk.h&gt;</p>

<p>Tk_CreatePhotoImageFormat(formatPtr)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS Tk_PhotoImageFormat *formatPtr (in) Structure
that defines the new file format.
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Tk_CreatePhotoImageFormat is invoked to
define a new file format for image data for use with photo
images. The code that implements an image file format is
called an image file format handler, or handler for short.
The photo image code maintains a list of handlers that can
be used to read and write data to or from a file. Some
handlers may also support reading image data from a string
or converting image data to a string format. The user can
specify which handler to use with the -format image
configuration option or the -format option to the read and
write photo image subcommands.</p>

<p>An image file format handler consists of a collection of
procedures plus a Tk_PhotoImageFormat structure, which
contains the name of the image file format and pointers to
six procedures provided by the han- dler to deal with files
and strings in this format. The Tk_PhotoImage- Format
structure contains the following fields: typedef struct
Tk_PhotoImageFormat { char *name; Tk_ImageFileMatchProc
*fileMatchProc; Tk_ImageStringMatchProc *stringMatchProc;
Tk_ImageFileReadProc *fileReadProc; Tk_ImageStringReadProc
*stringReadProc; Tk_ImageFileWriteProc *fileWriteProc;
Tk_ImageStringWriteProc *stringWriteProc; }
Tk_PhotoImageFormat;</p>

<p>The handler need not provide implementations of all six
procedures. For example, the procedures that handle string
data would not be pro- vided for a format in which the image
data are stored in binary, and could therefore contain null
characters. If any procedure is not implemented, the
corresponding pointer in the Tk_PhotoImageFormat structure
should be set to NULL. The handler must provide the
fileMatchProc procedure if it provides the fileReadProc
procedure, and the stringMatchProc procedure if it provides
the stringReadProc proce- dure.</p>

<p>NAME formatPtr-&gt;name provides a name for the image
type. Once Tk_CreatePho- toImageFormat returns, this name
may be used in the -format photo image configuration and
subcommand option. The manual page for the photo image
(photo(n)) describes how image file formats are chosen based
on their names and the value given to the -format option.
The first char- acter of formatPtr-&gt;name must not be an
uppercase character from the ASCII character set (that is,
one of the characters A-Z). Such names are used only for
legacy interface support (see below).</p>

<p>FILEMATCHPROC formatPtr-&gt;fileMatchProc provides the
address of a procedure for Tk to call when it is searching
for an image file format handler suitable for reading data
in a given file. formatPtr-&gt;fileMatchProc must match the
following prototype: typedef int Tk_ImageFileMatchProc(
Tcl_Channel chan, const char *fileName, Tcl_Obj *format, int
*widthPtr, int *heightPtr, Tcl_Interp *interp); The fileName
argument is the name of the file containing the image data,
which is open for reading as chan. The format argument
contains the value given for the -format option, or NULL if
the option was not specified. If the data in the file
appears to be in the format sup- ported by this handler, the
formatPtr-&gt;fileMatchProc procedure should store the width
and height of the image in *widthPtr and *heightPtr
respectively, and return 1. Otherwise it should return
0.</p>

<p>STRINGMATCHPROC formatPtr-&gt;stringMatchProc provides
the address of a procedure for Tk to call when it is
searching for an image file format handler for suit- able
for reading data from a given string.
formatPtr-&gt;stringMatchProc must match the following
prototype: typedef int Tk_ImageStringMatchProc( Tcl_Obj
*data, Tcl_Obj *format, int *widthPtr, int *heightPtr,
Tcl_Interp *interp); The data argument points to the object
containing the image data. The format argument contains the
value given for the -format option, or NULL if the option
was not specified. If the data in the string appears to be
in the format supported by this handler, the for-
matPtr-&gt;stringMatchProc procedure should store the width
and height of the image in *widthPtr and *heightPtr
respectively, and return 1. Oth- erwise it should return
0.</p>

<p>FILEREADPROC formatPtr-&gt;fileReadProc provides the
address of a procedure for Tk to call to read data from an
image file into a photo image. for- matPtr-&gt;fileReadProc
must match the following prototype: typedef int
Tk_ImageFileReadProc( Tcl_Interp *interp, Tcl_Channel chan,
const char *fileName, Tcl_Obj *format, PhotoHandle
imageHandle, int destX, int destY, int width, int height,
int srcX, int srcY); The interp argument is the interpreter
in which the command was invoked to read the image; it
should be used for reporting errors. The image data is in
the file named fileName, which is open for reading as chan.
The format argument contains the value given for the -format
option, or NULL if the option was not specified. The image
data in the file, or a subimage of it, is to be read into
the photo image identified by the handle imageHandle. The
subimage of the data in the file is of dimen- sions width x
height and has its top-left corner at coordinates
(srcX,srcY). It is to be stored in the photo image with its
top-left corner at coordinates (destX,destY) using the
Tk_PhotoPutBlock procedure. The return value is a standard
Tcl return value.</p>

<p>STRINGREADPROC formatPtr-&gt;stringReadProc provides the
address of a procedure for Tk to call to read data from a
string into a photo image. for- matPtr-&gt;stringReadProc
must match the following prototype: typedef int
Tk_ImageStringReadProc( Tcl_Interp *interp, Tcl_Obj *data,
Tcl_Obj *format, PhotoHandle imageHandle, int destX, int
destY, int width, int height, int srcX, int srcY); The
interp argument is the interpreter in which the command was
invoked to read the image; it should be used for reporting
errors. The data argument points to the image data in object
form. The format argument contains the value given for the
-format option, or NULL if the option was not specified. The
image data in the string, or a subimage of it, is to be read
into the photo image identified by the handle imageHan- dle.
The subimage of the data in the string is of dimensions
width x height and has its top-left corner at coordinates
(srcX,srcY). It is to be stored in the photo image with its
top-left corner at coordinates (destX,destY) using the
Tk_PhotoPutBlock procedure. The return value is a standard
Tcl return value.</p>

<p>FILEWRITEPROC formatPtr-&gt;fileWriteProc provides the
address of a procedure for Tk to call to write data from a
photo image to a file. for- matPtr-&gt;fileWriteProc must
match the following prototype: typedef int
Tk_ImageFileWriteProc( Tcl_Interp *interp, const char
*fileName, Tcl_Obj *format, Tk_PhotoImageBlock *blockPtr);
The interp argument is the interpreter in which the command
was invoked to write the image; it should be used for
reporting errors. The image data to be written are in memory
and are described by the Tk_PhotoIm- ageBlock structure
pointed to by blockPtr; see the manual page Find- Photo(3)
for details. The fileName argument points to the string giv-
ing the name of the file in which to write the image data.
The format argument contains the value given for the -format
option, or NULL if the option was not specified. The format
string can contain extra characters after the name of the
format. If appropriate, the for- matPtr-&gt;fileWriteProc
procedure may interpret these characters to spec- ify
further details about the image file. The return value is a
stan- dard Tcl return value.</p>

<p>STRINGWRITEPROC formatPtr-&gt;stringWriteProc provides
the address of a procedure for Tk to call to translate image
data from a photo image into a string. for-
matPtr-&gt;stringWriteProc must match the following
prototype: typedef int Tk_ImageStringWriteProc( Tcl_Interp
*interp, Tcl_Obj *format, Tk_PhotoImageBlock *blockPtr); The
interp argument is the interpreter in which the command was
invoked to convert the image; it should be used for
reporting errors. The image data to be converted are in
memory and are described by the Tk_PhotoImageBlock structure
pointed to by blockPtr; see the manual page FindPhoto(3) for
details. The data for the string should be put in the
interpreter interp result. The format argument contains the
value given for the -format option, or NULL if the option
was not specified. The format string can contain extra
characters after the name of the format. If appropriate, the
formatPtr-&gt;stringWriteProc procedure may interpret these
characters to specify further details about the image file.
The return value is a standard Tcl return value.</p>

<p>LEGACY INTERFACE SUPPORT In Tk 8.2 and earlier, the
definition of all the function pointer types stored in
fields of a Tk_PhotoImageFormat struct were incompatibly
dif- ferent. Legacy programs and libraries dating from those
days may still contain code that defines extended Tk photo
image formats using the old interface. The Tk header file
will still support this legacy interface if the code is
compiled with the macro USE_OLD_IMAGE defined. Alterna-
tively, the legacy interfaces are used if the first
character of for- matPtr-&gt;name is an uppercase ASCII
character (A-Z), and explicit casts are used to forgive the
type mismatch. For example, static Tk_PhotoImageFormat
myFormat = { &quot;MyFormat&quot;, (Tk_ImageFileMatchProc *)
FileMatch, NULL, (Tk_ImageFileReadProc *) FileRead, NULL,
NULL, NULL }; would define a minimal Tk_PhotoImageFormat
that operates provide only file reading capability, where
FileMatch and FileRead are written according to the legacy
interfaces of Tk 8.2 or earlier.</p>

<p>Any stub-enabled extension providing an extended photo
image format via the legacy interface enabled by the
USE_OLD_IMAGE macro that is com- piled against Tk 8.5
headers and linked against the Tk 8.5 stub library will
produce a file that can be loaded only into interps with Tk
8.5 or later; that is, the normal stub-compatibility rules.
If a developer needs to generate from such code a file that
is loadable into interps with Tk 8.4 or earlier, they must
use Tk 8.4 headers and stub libraries to do so.</p>

<p>Any new code written today should not make use of the
legacy inter- faces. Expect their support to go away in Tk
9.</p>
