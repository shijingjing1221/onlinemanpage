<p>PERFALLOC(1) PERFALLOC(1)</p>

<p>NAME perfalloc - notify pmdaperfevent(1) to disable
hardware counter alloca- tion.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/perfevent/perfalloc [-D] [-d]
[-f lockfile] [-h] [-v] [COMMAND]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION perfalloc is a command that notifies the
pmdaperfevent(1) to disable hardware counter event
collection. This allow unpriviledged processes to use the
hardware counters.</p>

<p>If the reservation request fails, then perfalloc exits
immediately with exit code EXIT_FAILURE. If successful, the
perfalloc will run until a kill signal is received. The
reservation request persists while perfal- loc is
running.</p>

<p>If a commandline is given, this is executed as a
subprocess of the agent. When the command dies, so does the
agent.</p>

<p>A brief description of the command line options
follows:</p>

<p>-D run in the foreground (the default)</p>

<p>-d run in the background</p>

<p>-f FILE use FILE as the lock file (default
$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/perfevent/per- flock)</p>

<p>-h display a help message and exit</p>

<p>-v output version number and exit</p>

<p>BUGS There may be a delay of up to 100 miliseconds
between perfalloc requesting the hardware counter disabling
and the perfevent pmda pro- cessing the request.</p>

<p>The perfalloc process does not check the status of the
request and therefore is not able to provide a positive
confirmation that the request succeeded and the hardware
counters are disabled.</p>
