<p>NAME newhelp - generate a performance metrics help
database</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS $PCP_BINADM_DIR/newhelp [-V] [-n pmnsfile] [-o
outputfile] [-v version] [file ...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION newhelp generates the Performance Co-Pilot
help text files used by Per- formance Metric Domain Agents
(PMDAs).</p>

<p>Normally newhelp operates on the default Performance
Metrics Name Space (PMNS), however if the -n option is
specified an alternative namespace is loaded from the file
pmnsfile.</p>

<p>When there is only one input file, the base name of the
new database is derived from the name of the input file,
otherwise the -o flag must be given to explicitly name the
database. If no input files are supplied, newhelp reads from
the standard input stream, in which case the -o flag must be
given.</p>

<p>If the output file name is determined to be foo, newhelp
will create foo.dir and foo.pag.</p>

<p>Although historically there have been multiple help text
file formats, the only format currently supported using the
-v option is version 2, and this is the default if no -v
flag is provided.</p>

<p>The -V flag causes verbose messages to be printed while
newhelp is parsing its input.</p>

<p>The first line of each entry in a help source file
consists of an @ character beginning the line followed by a
space and then the perfor- mance metric name and a one line
description of the metric. Following lines (up to the next
line beginning with @ or end of file) may contain a verbose
help description. E.g.</p>

<p># # This is an example of newhelps input syntax # @
kernel.all.cpu.idle CPU idle time A cumulative count of the
number of milliseconds of CPU idle time, summed over all
processors.</p>

<p>Three-part numeric metric identifiers (PMIDs) may be
used in place of metric names, e.g. 60.0.23 rather than
kernel.all.cpu.idle in the exam- ple above. Other than for
dynamic metrics (where the existence of a metric is known to
a PMDA, but not visible in the PMNS and hence has no name
that could be known to newhelp) use of this syntactic
variant is not encouraged.</p>

<p>Lines beginning with # are ignored, as are blank lines
in the file before the first @. The verbose help text is
optional.</p>

<p>As a special case, a metric name of the form NNN.MM (for
numeric NNN and MM) is interpreted as an instance domain
identification, and the text describes the instance
domain.</p>

<p>FILES $PCP_VAR_DIR/pmns/* default PMNS specification
files</p>

<p>PCP ENVIRONMENT Environment variables with the prefix
PCP_ are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP. On each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in pcp.conf(5).</p>

<p>SEE ALSO chkhelp(1), PMAPI(3), pmLookupInDomText(3),
pmLookupText(3), pcp.conf(5) and pcp.env(5).</p>
