<p>NAME XmClipboardStartRetrieve A clipboard function that
prepares to retrieve data from the clipboard</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;Xm/CutPaste.h&gt; int
XmClipboardStartRetrieve (display, window, timestamp)
Display * display; Window window; Time timestamp; (void)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION XmClipboardStartRetrieve tells the clipboard
routines that the applica- tion is ready to start copying an
item from the clipboard. The clip- board is locked by this
routine and stays locked until XmClipboardEn- dRetrieve is
called. Between a call to XmClipboardStartRetrieve and a
call to XmClipboardEndRetrieve, multiple calls to
XmClipboardRetrieve with the same format name result in data
being incrementally copied from the clipboard until the data
in that format has all been retrieved.</p>

<p>A return value of XmClipboardTruncate from calls to
XmClipboardRetrieve indicates that more data remains to be
copied in the given format. It is recommended that any calls
to the Inquire functions that the appli- cation needs to
make to complete the copy from the clipboard be made between
the call to XmClipboardStartRetrieve and the first call to
XmClipboardRetrieve. This way, the application does not need
to call XmClipboardLock and XmClipboardUnlock.</p>

<p>display Specifies a pointer to the Display structure
that was returned in a previous call to XOpenDisplay or
XtDisplay.</p>

<p>window Specifies the window ID of a widget that relates
the applica- tion window to the clipboard. The widgets
window ID can be obtained through XtWindow. The same
application instance should pass the same window ID to each
of the clipboard func- tions that it calls.</p>

<p>timestamp Specifies the time of the event that triggered
the copy. A valid timestamp must be supplied; it is not
sufficient to use CurrentTime.</p>

<p>RETURN XmClipboardSuccess The function is
successful.</p>

<p>XmClipboardLocked The function failed because the
clipboard was locked by another application. The application
can continue to call the function again with the same
parameters until the lock goes away. This gives the
application the opportunity to ask if the user wants to keep
trying or to give up on the operation.</p>
