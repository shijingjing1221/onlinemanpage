<p>NAME slapo-retcode - return code overlay to slapd</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS /etc/openldap/slapd.conf</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The retcode overlay to slapd(8) is useful to
test the behavior of clients when server-generated erroneous
and/or unusual responses occur, e.g. error codes, referrals,
excessive response times and so on.</p>

<p>The error responses are generated according to different
strategies.</p>

<p>In the first case, all operations targeted at a specific
configurable subtree cause the object related to the request
DN to be looked up and checked for return code data: a
response code, plus an optional textual message, an optional
configurable delay, an optional matched DN field, and, when
the response code is &quot;referral&quot;, a (list of)
referral(s).</p>

<p>Well-known response codes from standard track documents
are provided in retcode.conf, which can be included after
instantiating the overlay.</p>

<p>In the second case, objects of classes inherited from
the errAbsObject, like errObject or errAuxObject, when
returned as intermediate responses of a search request, are
changed into the response dictated by their content.</p>

<p>A third mode causes objects to be looked up from the
underlying database to discover if their class inherits from
errABsObject; in that case, their content is used to compute
the corresponding response.</p>

<p>The behavior is disabled by using the manageDSAit
control (RFC 3296); in that case, the resulting object,
either present in the directory or dynamically generated by
the overlay, or contained in the request, is handled as
usual.</p>

<p>The config directives that are specific to the retcode
overlay must be prefixed by retcode-, to avoid conflicts
with directives specific to the underlying database or to
other stacked overlays. The following specific directives
can be used to configure the retcode overlay:</p>

<p>retcode-parent &lt;DN&gt; This directive defines the
parent DN where dynamically generated entries reside. If not
defined, the suffix of the database is used.</p>

<p>retcode-item &lt;RDN&gt; &lt;errCode&gt;
[op=&lt;oplist&gt;] [text=&lt;message&gt;]
[ref=&lt;referral&gt;] [sleeptime=&lt;sec&gt;]
[matched=&lt;DN&gt;]
[unsolicited=&lt;OID&gt;[:&lt;data&gt;]]
[flags=[{pre|post}-]disconnect[,...]] A dynamically
generated entry, located below retcode-parent. The errCode
is the number of the response code; it can be in any format
supported by strtol(3). The optional oplist is a list of
operations that cause response code generation; if absent,
all operations are affected. The matched field is the
matched DN that is returned along with the error, while the
text field is an optional diagnostics message. The ref field
is only allowed for the referral response code. The
sleeptime field causes slapd(8) to sleep the specified
number of seconds before proceeding with the operation. The
unsolicited field can be used to cause the return of an RFC
4511 unsolicited response message; if OID is not
&quot;0&quot;, an extended response is generated, with the
optional data appended. If flags contains disconnect, or
pre-disconnect, slapd(8) disconnects abruptly, without
notice; post-disconnect causes disconnection right after
sending response as appropriate.</p>

<p>retcode-indir Enables exploitation of in-directory
stored errAbsObject. May result in a lot of unnecessary
overhead.</p>

<p>retcode-sleep [-]&lt;n&gt; Defines a sleep time in
seconds that is spent before actually handling any
operation. If negative, a random time between 0 and the
absolute value of the argument is used.</p>

<p>SCHEMA The retcode overlay utilizes the &quot;return
code&quot; schema described herein. This schema is
specifically designed for use with this overlay and is not
intended to be used otherwise. It is also noted that the
schema described here is a work in progress, and hence
subject to change without notice. The schema is loaded
automatically by the overlay.</p>

<p>The schema includes a number of object classes and
associated attribute types as described below.</p>

<p>The OID to be returned as extended response OID in RFC
4511 unsolicited responses (&quot;0&quot; generates a
regular response with msgid set to 0): (

DESC Data to be returned within unsolicited response SYNTAX
1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.40 SINGLE-VALUE )</p>

<p>If TRUE, slapd(8) disconnects abruptly without notice;
if FALSE, it disconnects after sending response as
appropriate: ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.666.11.4.1.8 NAME (
errDisconnect ) DESC Disconnect without notice SYNTAX
1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.7 SINGLE-VALUE )</p>

<p>The abstract class that triggers the overlay: (
1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.666.11.4.3.0 NAME ( errAbsObject ) SUP top
ABSTRACT MUST ( errCode ) MAY ( cn $ description $ errOp $

<p>The standalone structural objectclass for specifically
created data: ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.666.11.4.3.1 NAME (

<p>The auxiliary objectclass to alter the behavior of
existing objects: ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.666.11.4.3.2 NAME (
