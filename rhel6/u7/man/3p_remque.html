<p>INSQUE(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual INSQUE(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME insque, remque - insert or remove an element in a
queue</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;search.h&gt;</p>

<p>void insque(void *element, void *pred); void remque(void
*element);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The insque() and remque() functions shall
manipulate queues built from doubly-linked lists. The queue
can be either circular or linear. An application using
insque() or remque() shall ensure it defines a struc- ture
in which the first two members of the structure are pointers
to the same type of structure, and any further members are
application- specific. The first member of the structure is
a forward pointer to the next entry in the queue. The second
member is a backward pointer to the previous entry in the
queue. If the queue is linear, the queue is terminated with
null pointers. The names of the structure and of the pointer
members are not subject to any special restriction.</p>

<p>The insque() function shall insert the element pointed
to by element into a queue immediately after the element
pointed to by pred.</p>

<p>The remque() function shall remove the element pointed
to by element from a queue.</p>

<p>If the queue is to be used as a linear list, invoking
insque(&amp;element, NULL), where element is the initial
element of the queue, shall ini- tialize the forward and
backward pointers of element to null pointers.</p>

<p>If the queue is to be used as a circular list, the
application shall ensure it initializes the forward pointer
and the backward pointer of the initial element of the queue
to the elements own address.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The insque() and remque() functions do not
return a value.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Creating a Linear Linked List The following
example creates a linear linked list.</p>

<p>#include &lt;search.h&gt; ... struct myque element1;
struct myque element2;</p>

<p>char *data1 = &quot;DATA1&quot;; char *data2 =
&quot;DATA2&quot;; ... element1.data = data1; element2.data
= data2;</p>

<p>insque (&amp;element1, NULL); insque (&amp;element2,
&amp;element1);</p>

<p>Creating a Circular Linked List The following example
creates a circular linked list.</p>

<p>#include &lt;search.h&gt; ... struct myque element1;
struct myque element2;</p>

<p>char *data1 = &quot;DATA1&quot;; char *data2 =
&quot;DATA2&quot;; ... element1.data = data1; element2.data
= data2;</p>

<p>element1.fwd = &amp;element1; element1.bck =
&amp;element1;</p>

<p>insque (&amp;element2, &amp;element1);</p>

<p>Removing an Element The following example removes the
element pointed to by element1.</p>

<p>#include &lt;search.h&gt; ... struct myque element1; ...
remque (&amp;element1);</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The historical implementations of
these functions described the argu- ments as being of type
struct qelem * rather than as being of type void * as
defined here. In those implementations, struct qelem was
commonly defined in &lt;search.h&gt; as:</p>

<p>struct qelem { struct qelem *q_forw; struct qelem
*q_back; };</p>

<p>Applications using these functions, however, were never
able to use this structure directly since it provided no
room for the actual data contained in the elements. Most
applications defined structures that contained the two
pointers as the initial elements and also provided space
for, or pointers to, the object s data. Applications that
used these functions to update more than one type of table
also had the problem of specifying two or more different
structures with the same name, if they literally used struct
qelem as specified.</p>

<p>As described here, the implementations were actually
expecting a struc- ture type where the first two members
were forward and backward point- ers to structures. With C
compilers that didn t provide function prototypes,
applications used structures as specified in the DESCRIP-
TION above and the compiler did what the application
expected.</p>

<p>If this method had been carried forward with an ISO C
standard compiler and the historical function prototype,
most applications would have to be modified to cast pointers
to the structures actually used to be pointers to struct
qelem to avoid compilation warnings. By specifying void * as
the argument type, applications do not need to change
(unless they specifically referenced struct qelem and
depended on it being defined in &lt;search.h&gt;).</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
