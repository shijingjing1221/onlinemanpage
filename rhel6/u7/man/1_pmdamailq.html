<p>NAME pmdamailq - mail queue performance metrics domain
agent (PMDA)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/mailq/pmdamailq [-b binlist] [-d
domain] [-l logfile] [-r regex] [-U username] [queuedir]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pmdamailq is a Performance Metrics Domain
Agent (PMDA) which extracts performance metrics describing
the state of the e-mail queues managed by sendmail(1) and
other mail transfer agents.</p>

<p>The mailq PMDA exports metrics that measure the total
number of entries in the mail queue, and the subtotals for
entries that have been queued for various time periods.</p>

<p>A brief description of the pmdamailq command line
options follows:</p>

<p>-b The binlist argument specifies a list of delay
thresholds used to bin the entries in the queue into a a
histogram based on how long the entry has been in the mail
queue. The default thresholds are: 1 hour, 4 hours, 8 hours,
1 day, 3 days and 7 days. The entries in binlist are comma
separated time intervals, using the syntax described in
PCPIntro(1) for an update or reporting inter- val, e.g. the
default list could be specified using the value
1hr,4hrs,8hrs,1day,3days,7days.</p>

<p>Values in binlist are assumed to be in ascending order,
and mail items in the queue less than the first threshold
are binned into a special bin labeled recent.</p>

<p>-d It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics
domain num- ber specified here is unique and consistent.
That is, domain should be different for every PMDA on the
one host, and the same domain number should be used for the
same PMDA on all hosts.</p>

<p>-l Location of the log file. By default, a log file
named mailq.log is written in the current directory of
pmcd(1) when pmdamailq is started, i.e. $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd .
If the log file cannot be cre- ated or is not writable,
output is written to the standard error instead.</p>

<p>-r Use an extended regular expression to match file
names in the mail queue directory, rather than assuming all
&quot;df&quot; prefixed files in the directory are mail
files (the &quot;df&quot; prefix is the sendmail con-
vention, but this convention is not followed by other mail
dae- mons). The regex pattern specified should conform to
the POSIX format described in regex(3), and it describes
file names that should be considered mail.</p>

<p>-U User account under which to run the agent. The
default is the unprivileged &quot;pcp&quot; account in
current versions of PCP, but in older versions the superuser
account (&quot;root&quot;) was used by default.</p>

<p>The optional queuedir argument defines the directory in
which pmdamailq expects to find the mail queue. The default
is /var/spool/mqueue.</p>

<p>INSTALLATION If you want access to the names, help text
and values for the mailq performance metrics, do the
following as root:</p>

<p># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/mailq # ./Install</p>

<p>If you want to undo the installation, do the following
as root:</p>

<p># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/mailq # ./Remove</p>

<p>pmdamailq is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be
executed directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify
pmcd(1) when the agent is installed or removed.</p>

<p>FILES $PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH command line options used to
launch pmdamailq $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/mailq/help default help text
file for the mailq metrics $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/mailq/Install
installation script for the pmdamailq agent
$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/mailq/Remove undo installation script for the
pmdamailq agent $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/mailq.log default log file
for error messages and other information from pmdamailq</p>

<p>PCP ENVIRONMENT Environment variables with the prefix
PCP_ are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP. On each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in pcp.conf(5).</p>
