<p>DESCRIPTION pilot-read-palmpix allows a Kodak PalmPix
camera user to extract the images from their Palm handheld
and convert them to Portable Network Graphic (.png) or
Portable Pixmap (.ppm) files on their system. The default
output type is Portable Pixmap (.ppm).</p>

<p>pilot-read-palmpix converts all pictures in the files
given, or if no files are given, on a Palm handheld, to
Portable Pixmap files.</p>

<p>OPTIONS pilot-read-palmpix options -b, --bias bias</p>

<p>lighten or darken the image (0..49 darken, 51..100
lighten)</p>

<p>-c, --colour</p>

<p>Do a simple colour correction. The colour correction
code makes a his- togram from the image. Using the histogram
it then makes up a couple of colour tables to try and
balance the colours. It also clips the top and bottom
colours to produce better perceived contrast.</p>

<p>-l, --list</p>

<p>List picture information found on the Palm handheld
instead of convert- ing the entries found to image
files.</p>

<p>-n, --name &lt;pixname&gt;</p>

<p>Convert only pixname to STDOUT, and output as type: .ppm
or .png.</p>

<p>-s, --stretch</p>

<p>Do a histogram stretch on the colour planes</p>

<p>-t, --type [ppm|png]</p>

<p>Specify the output picture type. Can be either
&quot;png&quot; or &quot;ppm&quot;.</p>

<p>Conduit Options -p, --port port</p>

<p>Use device file &lt;port&gt; to communicate with the
Palm handheld. If this is not specified, pilot-read-palmpix
will look for the $PILOTPORT environment variable. If
neither are found or supplied, pilot-read-palmpix will print
the usage information.</p>

<p>-q, --quiet</p>

<p>Suppress Hit HotSync button message</p>

<p>-v, --version</p>

<p>Display version of pilot-read-palmpix and exit without
connecting.</p>

<p>Help Options -h, --help</p>

<p>Display the help synopsis for pilot-read-palmpix and
exit without con- necting.</p>

<p>--usage</p>

<p>Display a brief usage message and exit without
connecting.</p>

<p>USAGE If a filelist is not given, connects to the target
Palm handheld, and reads the images found in the Kodak
PalmPix image database (ArchIm- age.pdb), and allows the
user to view the list of images and image details, or to
select one or all of them, and convert them to Portable
Network Graphic (.png) or Portable Pixmap (.ppm) files to be
viewed or printed at the desktop.</p>

<p>If no options are specified, all of the images on the
device will be converted to ppm files by default.</p>

<p>If a filelist is given, convert all listed files
previously fetched via pilot-xfer. See BUGS - a single file
argument is ignored, a list will work.</p>

<p>BUGS Known Bugs pilot-read-palmpix s colour correction
is nearly as good as Kodaks own, but Kodak has deprecated
the PalmPix device, so it is not likely that there will be
any updates to their software in the future, so this may be
as good as it gets. A simple method to improve the look of
colours is to do a histogram equalization in your favourite
image edi- tor.</p>

<p>pilot-read-palmpix command DOES read from a file, but
only if you specify a LIST of files. If only one file is
given, the command tries reading from $PILOTPORT.</p>
