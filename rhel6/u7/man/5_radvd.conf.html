<p>RADVD.CONF(5) RADVD.CONF(5)</p>

<p>NAME radvd.conf - configuration file of the router
advertisement daemon radvd</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This file describes the information which is
included in the router advertisement (RA) of a specific
interface.</p>

<p>The file contains one or more interface definitions of
the form:</p>

<p>interface name { list of interface specific options list
of prefix definitions list of clients (IPv6 addresses) to
advertise to list of route definitions list of RDNSS
definitions };</p>

<p>All the possible interface specific options are detailed
below. Each option has to be terminated by a semicolon.</p>

<p>Prefix definitions are of the form:</p>

<p>prefix prefix/length { list of prefix specific options
};</p>

<p>Prefix can be network prefix or the address of the
inferface. The address of interface should be used when
using Mobile IPv6 extensions.</p>

<p>Special prefix &quot;::/64&quot; is also supported on
systems that implement getifaddrs() (on other systems,
configuration activation fails and radvd exits). When
configured, radvd picks one non-link-local prefix assigned
to the interface and starts advertising it. This may be
applicable in non-6to4 scenarios where the upstream prefix
might change. This option is incompatible with
Base6to4Interface option. AdvRouterAddr option is always
enabled when this configuration is used.</p>

<p>All the possible prefix specific options are described
below. Each option has to be terminated by a semicolon.</p>

<p>Decimal values are allowed only for MinDelayBetweenRAs,
MaxRtrAdvInter- val and MinRtrAdvInterval. Decimal values
should be used only when using Mobile IPv6 extensions.</p>

<p>Route definitions are of the form:</p>

<p>route prefix/length { list of route specific options
};</p>

<p>The prefix of a route definition should be network
prefix; it can be used to advertise more specific routes to
the hosts.</p>

<p>RDNSS (Recursive DNS server) definitions are of the
form:</p>

<p>RDNSS ip [ip] [ip] { list of rdnss specific options
};</p>

<p>By default radvd will send route advertisements so that
every node on the link can use them. The list of clients
(IPv6 address) to advertise to, and accept route
solicitations from can be configured. If done, radvd does
not send send messages to the multicast addresses but to the
configured unicast addresses only. Solicitations from other
addresses are refused. This is similar to UnicastOnly but
includes periodic mes- sages and incoming client access
configuration. See examples section for a use case of
this.</p>

<p>The definitions are of the form:</p>

<p>clients { list of IPv6 addresses };</p>

<p>INTERFACE SPECIFIC OPTIONS IgnoreIfMissing on|off</p>

<p>A flag indicating whether or not the interface is
ignored if it does not exist at start-up. By default, radvd
exits.</p>

<p>This is useful for dynamic interfaces which are not
active when radvd starts or which are dynamically disabled
and re-enabled during the time radvd runs.</p>

<p>Current versions of radvd automatically try to re-enable
inter- faces.</p>

<p>Enabling IgnoreIfMissing also quenches certain warnings
in log messages relating to missing interfaces.</p>

<p>Default: off</p>

<p>AdvSendAdvert on|off</p>

<p>A flag indicating whether or not the router sends
periodic router advertisements and responds to router
solicitations.</p>

<p>This option no longer has to be specified first, but it
needs to be on to enable advertisement on this
interface.</p>

<p>Default: off</p>

<p>UnicastOnly on|off</p>

<p>Indicates that the interface link type only supports
unicast. This will prevent unsolicited advertisements from
being sent, and will cause solicited advertisements to be
unicast to the soliciting node. This option is necessary for
non-broadcast, multiple-access links, such as ISATAP.</p>

<p>Default: off</p>

<p>MaxRtrAdvInterval seconds</p>

<p>The maximum time allowed between sending unsolicited
multicast router advertisements from the interface, in
seconds.</p>

<p>Must be no less than 4 seconds and no greater than 1800
seconds.</p>

<p>Minimum when using Mobile IPv6 extensions: 0.07.</p>

<p>For values less than 0.2 seconds, 0.02 seconds is added
to account for scheduling granularities as specified in
RFC3775.</p>

<p>Default: 600 seconds</p>

<p>MinRtrAdvInterval seconds</p>

<p>The minimum time allowed between sending unsolicited
multicast router advertisements from the interface, in
seconds.</p>

<p>Must be no less than 3 seconds and no greater than 0.75
* MaxR- trAdvInterval.</p>

<p>Minimum when using Mobile IPv6 extensions: 0.03.</p>

<p>Default: 0.33 * MaxRtrAdvInterval</p>

<p>MinDelayBetweenRAs seconds</p>

<p>The minimum time allowed between sending multicast
router adver- tisements from the interface, in seconds.</p>

<p>This applies to solicited multicast RAs. This is defined
as the protocol constant MIN_DELAY_BETWEEN_RAS in RFC4861.
MIPv6 rede- fines this parameter to have a minimum of 0.03
seconds.</p>

<p>Minimum when using Mobile IPv6 extensions: 0.03.</p>

<p>Default: 3</p>

<p>AdvManagedFlag on|off</p>

<p>When set, hosts use the administered (stateful) protocol
for address autoconfiguration in addition to any addresses
autocon- figured using stateless address autoconfiguration.
The use of this flag is described in RFC 4862.</p>

<p>Default: off</p>

<p>AdvOtherConfigFlag on|off</p>

<p>When set, hosts use the administered (stateful) protocol
for autoconfiguration of other (non-address) information.
The use of this flag is described in RFC 4862.</p>

<p>Default: off</p>

<p>AdvLinkMTU integer</p>

<p>The MTU option is used in router advertisement messages
to insure that all nodes on a link use the same MTU value in
those cases where the link MTU is not well known.</p>

<p>If specified, i.e. not 0, must not be smaller than 1280
and not greater than the maximum MTU allowed for this link
(e.g. ether- net has a maximum MTU of 1500. See RFC
4864).</p>

<p>Default: 0</p>

<p>AdvReachableTime milliseconds</p>

<p>The time, in milliseconds, that a node assumes a
neighbor is reachable after having received a reachability
confirmation. Used by the Neighbor Unreachability Detection
algorithm (see Section 7.3 of RFC 4861). A value of zero
means unspecified (by this router).</p>

<p>Must be no greater than 3,600,000 milliseconds (1
hour).</p>

<p>Default: 0</p>

<p>AdvRetransTimer milliseconds</p>

<p>The time, in milliseconds, between retransmitted
Neighbor Solic- itation messages. Used by address resolution
and the Neighbor Unreachability Detection algorithm (see
Sections 7.2 and 7.3 of RFC 4861). A value of zero means
unspecified (by this router).</p>

<p>Default: 0</p>

<p>AdvCurHopLimit integer</p>

<p>The default value that should be placed in the Hop Count
field of the IP header for outgoing (unicast) IP packets.
The value should be set to the current diameter of the
Internet. The value zero means unspecified (by this
router).</p>

<p>Default: 64</p>

<p>AdvDefaultLifetime seconds</p>

<p>The lifetime associated with the default router in units
of sec- onds. The maximum value corresponds to 18.2 hours. A
lifetime of 0 indicates that the router is not a default
router and should not appear on the default router list. The
router life- time applies only to the router s usefulness as
a default router; it does not apply to information contained
in other mes- sage fields or options. Options that need time
limits for their information include their own lifetime
fields.</p>

<p>Must be either zero or between MaxRtrAdvInterval and
9000 sec- onds.</p>

<p>Default: 3 * MaxRtrAdvInterval (Minimum 1 second).</p>

<p>AdvDefaultPreference low|medium|high</p>

<p>The preference associated with the default router, as
either &quot;low&quot;, &quot;medium&quot;, or
&quot;high&quot;.</p>

<p>Default: medium</p>

<p>AdvSourceLLAddress on|off</p>

<p>When set, the link-layer address of the outgoing
interface is included in the RA.</p>

<p>Default: on</p>

<p>AdvHomeAgentFlag on|off</p>

<p>When set, indicates that sending router is able to serve
as Mobile IPv6 Home Agent. When set, minimum limits
specified by Mobile IPv6 are used for MinRtrAdvInterval and
MaxRtrAdvInter- val.</p>

<p>Default: off</p>

<p>AdvHomeAgentInfo on|off</p>

<p>When set, Home Agent Information Option (specified by
Mobile IPv6) is included in Router Advertisements.
AdvHomeAgentFlag must also be set when using this
option.</p>

<p>Default: off</p>

<p>HomeAgentLifetime seconds</p>

<p>The length of time in seconds (relative to the time the
packet is sent) that the router is offering Mobile IPv6 Home
Agent ser- vices. A value 0 must not be used. The maximum
lifetime is 65520 seconds (18.2 hours). This option is
ignored, if AdvHome- AgentInfo is not set.</p>

<p>If both HomeAgentLifetime and HomeAgentPreference are
set to their default values, Home Agent Information Option
will not be sent.</p>

<p>Default: AdvDefaultLifetime</p>

<p>HomeAgentPreference integer</p>

<p>The preference for the Home Agent sending this Router
Advertise- ment. Values greater than 0 indicate more
preferable Home Agent, values less than 0 indicate less
preferable Home Agent. This option is ignored, if
AdvHomeAgentInfo is not set.</p>

<p>If both HomeAgentLifetime and HomeAgentPreference are
set to their default values, Home Agent Information Option
will not be sent.</p>

<p>Default: 0</p>

<p>AdvMobRtrSupportFlag on|off</p>

<p>When set, the Home Agent signals it supports Mobile
Router reg- istrations (specified by NEMO Basic).
AdvHomeAgentInfo must also be set when using this
option.</p>

<p>Default: off</p>

<p>AdvIntervalOpt on|off</p>

<p>When set, Advertisement Interval Option (specified by
Mobile IPv6) is included in Router Advertisements. When set,
minimum limits specified by Mobile IPv6 are used for
MinRtrAdvInterval and MaxRtrAdvInterval.</p>

<p>The advertisement interval is based on the configured
MaxRtrAdv- Interval parameter except where this is less than
200ms. In this case, the advertised interval is (
MaxRtrAdvInterval + 20ms ).</p>

<p>Default: off</p>

<p>PREFIX SPECIFIC OPTIONS AdvOnLink on|off</p>

<p>When set, indicates that this prefix can be used for
on-link determination. When not set the advertisement makes
no state- ment about on-link or off-link properties of the
prefix. For instance, the prefix might be used for address
configuration with some of the addresses belonging to the
prefix being on-link and others being off-link.</p>

<p>Default: on</p>

<p>AdvAutonomous on|off</p>

<p>When set, indicates that this prefix can be used for
autonomous address configuration as specified in RFC
4862.</p>

<p>Default: on</p>

<p>AdvRouterAddr on|off</p>

<p>When set, indicates that the address of interface is
sent instead of network prefix, as is required by Mobile
IPv6. When set, minimum limits specified by Mobile IPv6 are
used for MinR- trAdvInterval and MaxRtrAdvInterval.</p>

<p>Default: off</p>

<p>AdvValidLifetime seconds|infinity</p>

<p>The length of time in seconds (relative to the time the
packet is sent) that the prefix is valid for the purpose of
on-link determination. The symbolic value infinity
represents infinity (i.e. a value of all one bits
(0xffffffff)). The valid lifetime is also used by RFC
4862.</p>

<p>Note that clients will ignore AdvValidLifetime of an
existing prefix if the lifetime is below two hours, as
required in RFC 4862 Section 5.5.3 point e).</p>

<p>Note: RFC4861 s suggested default value is significantly
longer: 30 days.</p>

<p>Default: 86400 seconds (1 day)</p>

<p>AdvPreferredLifetime seconds|infinity</p>

<p>The length of time in seconds (relative to the time the
packet is sent) that addresses generated from the prefix via
stateless address autoconfiguration remain preferred. The
symbolic value infinity represents infinity (i.e. a value of
all one bits (0xffffffff)). See RFC 4862.</p>

<p>Note: RFC4861 s suggested default value is significantly
longer: 7 days.</p>

<p>Default: 14400 seconds (4 hours)</p>

<p>Base6to4Interface name</p>

<p>If this option is specified, this prefix will be
combined with the IPv4 address of interface name to produce
a valid 6to4 pre- fix. The first 16 bits of this prefix will
be replaced by 2002 and the next 32 bits of this prefix will
be replaced by the IPv4 address assigned to interface name
at configuration time. The remaining 80 bits of the prefix
(including the SLA ID) will be advertised as specified in
the configuration file. See the next section for an
example.</p>

<p>If interface name is not available at configuration
time, a warning will be written to the log and this prefix
will be dis- abled until radvd is reconfigured.</p>

<p>This option enables systems with dynamic IPv4 addresses
to update their advertised 6to4 prefixes simply by
restarting radvd or sending a SIGHUP signal to cause radvd
to reconfigure itself.</p>

<p>Note that 6to4 prefixes derived from
dynamically-assigned IPv4 addresses should be advertised
with a significantly shorter lifetime (see the
AdvValidLifetime and AdvPreferredLifetime options).</p>

<p>For more information on 6to4, see RFC 3056.</p>

<p>Default: 6to4 is not used</p>

<p>ROUTE SPECIFIC OPTIONS AdvRouteLifetime
seconds|infinity</p>

<p>The lifetime associated with the route in units of
seconds. The symbolic value infinity represents infinity
(i.e. a value of all one bits (0xffffffff)).</p>

<p>Default: 3 * MaxRtrAdvInterval</p>

<p>AdvRoutePreference low|medium|high</p>

<p>The preference associated with the default router, as
either &quot;low&quot;, &quot;medium&quot;, or
&quot;high&quot;.</p>

<p>Default: medium</p>

<p>RDNSS SPECIFIC OPTIONS AdvRDNSSPreference integer;</p>

<p>The preference of the DNS server, compared to other DNS
servers advertised and used. 0 to 7 means less important
than manually configured nameservers in resolv.conf, while
12 to 15 means more important.</p>

<p>NOTE: This feature was removed from the final RFC but
can still be used for experimental purposes.</p>

<p>Default: 8</p>

<p>AdvRDNSSOpen on|off;</p>

<p>&quot;Service Open&quot; flag. When set, indicates that
RDNSS continues to be available to hosts even if they moved
to a different subnet.</p>

<p>NOTE: This feature was removed from the final RFC but
can still be used for experimental purposes.</p>

<p>Default: off</p>

<p>AdvRDNSSLifetime seconds|infinity; The maximum duration
how long the RDNSS entries are used for name resolution. A
value of 0 means the nameserver should no longer be used.
The maximum duration how long the RDNSS entries are used for
name resolution. A value of 0 means the nameserver should no
longer be used. The value, if not 0, must be at least
MaxRtrAdvInterval. To ensure stale RDNSS info gets removed
in a timely fashion, this should not be greater than
2*MaxRtrAdvIn- terval.</p>

<p>Default: 2*MaxRtrAdvInterval</p>

<p>EXAMPLES interface eth0 { AdvSendAdvert on; prefix
2001:db8:0:1::/64 { AdvOnLink on; AdvAutonomous on; };
};</p>

<p>It says that router advertisement daemon should
advertise (AdvSendAd- vert on;) the prefix 2001:db8:0:1::
which has a lenght of 64 on the interface eth0. Also the
prefix should be marked as autonomous (AdvAu- tonomous on;)
and as on-link (AdvOnLink on;). All the other options are
left on their default values.</p>

<p>To support movement detection of Mobile IPv6 Mobile
Nodes, the address of interface should be used instead of
network prefix:</p>

<p>interface eth0 { AdvSendAdvert on; prefix
2001:db8:0:1::4/64 { AdvOnLink on; AdvAutonomous on;
AdvRouterAddr on; }; };</p>

<p>For 6to4 support, include the Base6to4Interface option
in each prefix section. When using a dynamic IPv4 address,
set small prefix lifetimes to prevent hosts from retaining
unreachable prefixes after a new IPv4 address has been
assigned. When advertising to on a dynamic interface (e.g.,
Bluetooth), skip the interface if it is not active yet.</p>

<p>interface bnep0 { IgnoreIfMissing on; AdvSendAdvert
on;</p>

<p># Advertise at least every 30 seconds MaxRtrAdvInterval
30;</p>

<p>prefix 0:0:0:5678::/64 { AdvOnLink on; AdvAutonomous on;
Base6to4Interface ppp0;</p>

<p># Very short lifetimes for dynamic addresses
AdvValidLifetime 300; AdvPreferredLifetime 120; }; };</p>

<p>Since 6to4 is enabled, the prefix will be advertised as
2002:WWXX:YYZZ:5678::/64, where WW.XX.YY.ZZ is the IPv4
address of ppp0 at configuration time. (IPv6 addresses are
written in hexadecimal whereas IPv4 addresses are written in
decimal, so the IPv4 address WW.XX.YY.ZZ in the 6to4 prefix
will be represented in hex.)</p>

<p>In this specific case, the configuration scripts may
send HUP signal to radvd when taking bnep0 up or down to
notify about the status; in the current radvd releases,
sending HUP is no longer mandatory when the link comes back
up.</p>

<p>interface eth0 { AdvSendAdvert on; prefix
2001:db8:0:1::/64 { AdvOnLink on; AdvAutonomous on; };
clients { fe80::21f:16ff:fe06:3aab;
fe80::21d:72ff:fe96:aaff; }; };</p>

<p>This configuration would only announce the prefix to
fe80::21f:16ff:fe06:3aab and fe80::21d:72ff:fe96:aaff.
Furthermore, all RA requests of other clients are
denied.</p>

<p>This may come in handy if you want to roll out IPv6 only
partially because some clients are broken or untested.</p>
