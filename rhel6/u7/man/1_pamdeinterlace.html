<p>NAME pamdeinterlace - remove every other row from a
PAM/PNM image</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pamdeinterlace</p>

<p>[-takeodd]</p>

<p>[-takeeven]</p>

<p>[infile]</p>

<p>You can use the minimum unique abbreviation of the
options. You can use two hyphens instead of one. You can
separate an option name from its value with white space
instead of an equals sign.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pamdeinterlace removes all the even-numbered or
odd-numbered rows from the input PNM or PAM image. Specify
which with the -takeeven and -takeodd options.</p>

<p>This can be useful if the image is a video capture from
an interlaced video source. In that case, each row shows the
subject 1/60 second before or after the two rows that
surround it. If the subject is mov- ing, this can detract
from the quality of the image.</p>

<p>Because the resulting image is half the height of the
input image, you will then want to use pamstretch or
pamscale to restore it to its nor- mal height:</p>

<p>pamdeinterlace myimage.ppm | pamstretch -yscale=2
&gt;newimage.ppm</p>

<p>Another, usually better, way to deinterlace an image is
with pammixin- terlace.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -takeodd Take the odd-numbered rows from the
input and put them in the output. The rows are numbered
starting at zero, so the first row in the output is the
second row from the input. You cannot specify both -takeeven
and -takeodd.</p>

<p>-takeeven Take the even-numbered rows from the input and
put them in the output. The rows are numbered starting at
zero, so the first row in the output is the first row from
the input. This is the default. You cannot specify both
-takeeven and -takeodd.</p>
