<p>NAME pmdamounts - filesystem mounts performance metrics
domain agent (PMDA)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/mounts/pmdamounts [-d domain]
[-l logfile] [-U username]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pmdamounts is a simple Performance Metrics
Domain Agent (PMDA) which monitors availability of a given
set of filesystem mounts.</p>

<p>The mounts PMDA exports metrics that reflect whether the
configured filesystems are mounted (&quot;up&quot;) or not.
The list of mount points to monitor is specified via the
$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/mounts/mounts.conf file which simply contains
one line for each mount point.</p>

<p>Note that the platform kernel PMDA exports a more
extensive set of filesystem metrics for every mounted
filesystem - this PMDA is primar- ily intended for
availability monitoring using the mounts.up metric.</p>

<p>A brief description of the pmdamounts command line
options follows:</p>

<p>-d It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics
domain num- ber specified here is unique and consistent.
That is, domain should be different for every PMDA on the
one host, and the same domain number should be used for the
same PMDA on all hosts.</p>

<p>-l Location of the log file. By default, a log file
named mounts.log is written in the current directory of
pmcd(1) when pmdamounts is started, i.e. $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd.
If the log file cannot be cre- ated or is not writable,
output is written to the standard error instead.</p>

<p>-U User account under which to run the agent. The
default is the unprivileged &quot;pcp&quot; account in
current versions of PCP, but in older versions the superuser
account (&quot;root&quot;) was used by default.</p>

<p>INSTALLATION If you want access to the names, help text
and values for the mounts performance metrics, do the
following as root:</p>

<p># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/mounts # ./Install</p>

<p>If you want to undo the installation, do the following
as root:</p>

<p># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/mounts # ./Remove</p>

<p>pmdamounts is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be
executed directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify
pmcd(1) when the agent is installed or removed.</p>

<p>FILES $PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH command line options used to
launch pmdamounts $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/mounts/help default help
text file for the mounts metrics
$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/mounts/Install installation script for the
pmdamounts agent $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/mounts/Remove undo
installation script for the pmdamounts agent
$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/mounts.log default log file for error
messages and other information from pmdamounts</p>

<p>PCP ENVIRONMENT Environment variables with the prefix
PCP_ are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP. On each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in pcp.conf(5).</p>
