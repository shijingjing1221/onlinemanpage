Tk_AllocColorFromObj(3)</p>


<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME Tk_AllocColorFromObj, Tk_GetColor,
Tk_GetColorFromObj, Tk_GetColorBy- Value, Tk_NameOfColor,
Tk_FreeColorFromObj, Tk_FreeColor - maintain database of
colors</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tk.h&gt;</p>

<p>XColor * Tk_AllocColorFromObj(interp, tkwin, objPtr)</p>

<p>XColor * Tk_GetColor(interp, tkwin, name)</p>

<p>XColor * Tk_GetColorFromObj(tkwin, objPtr)</p>

<p>XColor * Tk_GetColorByValue(tkwin, prefPtr)</p>

<p>const char * Tk_NameOfColor(colorPtr)</p>

<p>GC Tk_GCForColor(colorPtr, drawable)</p>

<p>Tk_FreeColorFromObj(tkwin, objPtr)</p>

<p>Tk_FreeColor(colorPtr)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS Tcl_Interp *interp (in) Interpreter to use for
error report- ing.</p>

<p>Tk_Window tkwin (in) Token for window in which color
will be used.</p>

<p>Tcl_Obj *objPtr (in/out) String value describes desired
color; internal rep will be modified to cache pointer to
corresponding (XColor *).</p>

<p>char *name (in) Same as objPtr except description of
color is passed as a string and resulting (XColor *) is not
cached.</p>

<p>XColor *prefPtr (in) Indicates red, green, and blue
intensities of desired color.</p>

<p>XColor *colorPtr (in) Pointer to X color information.
Must have been allocated by previous call to
Tk_AllocColorFromObj, Tk_GetColor or Tk_GetColorByValue,
except when passed to Tk_NameOf- Color.</p>

<p>Drawable drawable (in) Drawable in which the result
graph- ics context will be used. Must have same screen and
depth as the window for which the color was allocated.

<p>DESCRIPTION These procedures manage the colors being
used by a Tk application. They allow colors to be shared
whenever possible, so that colormap space is preserved, and
they pick closest available colors when col- ormap space is
exhausted.</p>

<p>Given a textual description of a color,
Tk_AllocColorFromObj locates a pixel value that may be used
to render the color in a particular win- dow. The desired
color is specified with an object whose string value must
have one of the following forms:</p>

<p>colorname Any of the valid textual names for a color
defined in the server s color database file, such as red or
PeachPuff.</p>

<p>#RGB</p>

<p>#RRGGBB</p>

<p>#RRRGGGBBB</p>

<p>#RRRRGGGGBBBB A numeric specification of the red, green,
and blue intensities to use to display the color. Each R, G,
or B represents a single hexadecimal digit. The four forms
permit colors to be specified with 4-bit, 8-bit, 12-bit or
16-bit values. When fewer than 16 bits are provided for each
color, they rep- resent the most significant bits of the
color. For example, #3a7 is the same as #3000a0007000.</p>

<p>Tk_AllocColorFromObj returns a pointer to an XColor
structure; the structure indicates the exact intensities of
the allocated color (which may differ slightly from those
requested, depending on the limitations of the screen) and a
pixel value that may be used to draw with the color in
tkwin. If an error occurs in Tk_AllocColorFromObj (such as
an unknown color name) then NULL is returned and an error
message is stored in interps result if interp is not NULL.
If the colormap for tkwin is full, Tk_AllocColorFromObj will
use the closest existing color in the colormap.
Tk_AllocColorFromObj caches information about the return
value in objPtr, which speeds up future calls to procedures
such as Tk_AllocColorFromObj and Tk_GetColorFromObj.</p>

<p>Tk_GetColor is identical to Tk_AllocColorFromObj except
that the description of the color is specified with a string
instead of an object. This prevents Tk_GetColor from caching
the return value, so Tk_GetColor is less efficient than
Tk_AllocColorFromObj.</p>

<p>Tk_GetColorFromObj returns the token for an existing
color, given the window and description used to create the
color. Tk_GetColorFromObj does not actually create the
color; the color must already have been created with a
previous call to Tk_AllocColorFromObj or Tk_GetColor. The
return value is cached in objPtr, which speeds up future
calls to Tk_GetColorFromObj with the same objPtr and
tkwin.</p>

<p>Tk_GetColorByValue is similar to Tk_GetColor except that
the desired color is indicated with the red, green, and blue
fields of the struc- ture pointed to by colorPtr.</p>

<p>This package maintains a database of all the colors
currently in use. If the same color is requested multiple
times from Tk_GetColor or Tk_AllocColorFromObj (e.g. by
different windows), or if the same inten- sities are
requested multiple times from Tk_GetColorByValue, then
existing pixel values will be re-used. Re-using an existing
pixel avoids any interaction with the window server, which
makes the alloca- tion much more efficient. These procedures
also provide a portable interface that works across all
platforms. For this reason, you should generally use
Tk_AllocColorFromObj, Tk_GetColor, or Tk_GetColorByValue
instead of lower level procedures like XAllocColor.</p>

<p>Since different calls to this package may return the
same shared pixel value, callers should never change the
color of a pixel returned by the procedures. If you need to
change a color value dynamically, you should use
XAllocColorCells to allocate the pixel value for the
color.</p>

<p>The procedure Tk_NameOfColor is roughly the inverse of
Tk_GetColor. If its colorPtr argument was created by
Tk_AllocColorFromObj or Tk_Get- Color then the return value
is the string that was used to create the color. If colorPtr
was created by a call to Tk_GetColorByValue, or by any other
mechanism, then the return value is a string that could be
passed to Tk_GetColor to return the same color. Note: the
string returned by Tk_NameOfColor is only guaranteed to
persist until the next call to Tk_NameOfColor.</p>

<p>Tk_GCForColor returns a graphics context whose
foreground field is the pixel allocated for colorPtr and
whose other fields all have default values. This provides an
easy way to do basic drawing with a color. The graphics
context is cached with the color and will exist only as long
as colorPtr exists; it is freed when the last reference to
col- orPtr is freed by calling Tk_FreeColor.</p>

<p>When a color is no longer needed Tk_FreeColorFromObj or
Tk_FreeColor should be called to release it. For
Tk_FreeColorFromObj the color to release is specified with
the same information used to create it; for Tk_FreeColor the
color to release is specified with a pointer to its XColor
structure. There should be exactly one call to
Tk_FreeColorFro- mObj or Tk_FreeColor for each call to
Tk_AllocColorFromObj, Tk_Get- Color, or
Tk_GetColorByValue.</p>
