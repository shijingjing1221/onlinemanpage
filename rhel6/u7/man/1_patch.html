<p>PATCH(1) PATCH(1)</p>

<p>NAME patch - apply a diff file to an original</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS patch [options] [originalfile [patchfile]]</p>

<p>but usually just</p>

<p>patch -pnum &lt;patchfile</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION patch takes a patch file patchfile
containing a difference listing pro- duced by the diff
program and applies those differences to one or more
original files, producing patched versions. Normally the
patched ver- sions are put in place of the originals.
Backups can be made; see the -b or --backup option. The
names of the files to be patched are usu- ally taken from
the patch file, but if theres just one file to be patched it
can be specified on the command line as originalfile.</p>

<p>Upon startup, patch attempts to determine the type of
the diff listing, unless overruled by a -c (--context), -e
(--ed), -n (--normal), or -u (--unified) option. Context
diffs (old-style, new-style, and unified) and normal diffs
are applied by the patch program itself, while ed diffs are
simply fed to the ed(1) editor via a pipe.</p>

<p>patch tries to skip any leading garbage, apply the diff,
and then skip any trailing garbage. Thus you could feed an
article or message con- taining a diff listing to patch, and
it should work. If the entire diff is indented by a
consistent amount, or if a context diff contains lines
ending in CRLF or is encapsulated one or more times by
prepending &quot;- &quot; to lines starting with
&quot;-&quot; as specified by Internet RFC 934, this is
taken into account. After removing indenting or
encapsulation, lines beginning with # are ignored, as they
are considered to be com- ments.</p>

<p>With context diffs, and to a lesser extent with normal
diffs, patch can detect when the line numbers mentioned in
the patch are incorrect, and attempts to find the correct
place to apply each hunk of the patch. As a first guess, it
takes the line number mentioned for the hunk, plus or minus
any offset used in applying the previous hunk. If that is
not the correct place, patch scans both forwards and
backwards for a set of lines matching the context given in
the hunk. First patch looks for a place where all lines of
the context match. If no such place is found, and its a
context diff, and the maximum fuzz factor is set to 1 or
more, then another scan takes place ignoring the first and
last line of context. If that fails, and the maximum fuzz
factor is set to 2 or more, the first two and last two lines
of context are ignored, and another scan is made. (The
default maximum fuzz factor is 2.)</p>

<p>Hunks with less prefix context than suffix context
(after applying fuzz) must apply at the start of the file if
their first line number is 1. Hunks with more prefix context
than suffix context (after apply- ing fuzz) must apply at
the end of the file.</p>

<p>If patch cannot find a place to install that hunk of the
patch, it puts the hunk out to a reject file, which normally
is the name of the output file plus a .rej suffix, or # if
.rej would generate a file name that is too long (if even
appending the single character # makes the file name too
long, then # replaces the file names last character).</p>

<p>The rejected hunk comes out in unified or context diff
format. If the input was a normal diff, many of the contexts
are simply null. The line numbers on the hunks in the reject
file may be different than in the patch file: they reflect
the approximate location patch thinks the failed hunks
belong in the new file rather than the old one.</p>

<p>As each hunk is completed, you are told if the hunk
failed, and if so which line (in the new file) patch thought
the hunk should go on. If the hunk is installed at a
different line from the line number speci- fied in the diff,
you are told the offset. A single large offset may indicate
that a hunk was installed in the wrong place. You are also
told if a fuzz factor was used to make the match, in which
case you should also be slightly suspicious. If the
--verbose option is given, you are also told about hunks
that match exactly.</p>

<p>If no original file origfile is specified on the command
line, patch tries to figure out from the leading garbage
what the name of the file to edit is, using the following
rules.</p>

<p>First, patch takes an ordered list of candidate file
names as follows:</p>

<p>&middot; If the header is that of a context diff, patch
takes the old and new file names in the header. A name is
ignored if it does not have enough slashes to satisfy the
-pnum or --strip=num option. The name /dev/null is also
ignored.</p>

<p>&middot; If there is an Index: line in the leading
garbage and if either the old and new names are both absent
or if patch is conforming to POSIX, patch takes the name in
the Index: line.</p>

<p>&middot; For the purpose of the following rules, the
candidate file names are considered to be in the order (old,
new, index), regardless of the order that they appear in the
header.</p>

<p>Then patch selects a file name from the candidate list
as follows:</p>

<p>&middot; If some of the named files exist, patch selects
the first name if conforming to POSIX, and the best name
otherwise.</p>

<p>&middot; If patch is not ignoring RCS, ClearCase,
Perforce, and SCCS (see the -g num or --get=num option), and
no named files exist but an RCS, ClearCase, Perforce, or
SCCS master is found, patch selects the first named file
with an RCS, ClearCase, Perforce, or SCCS master.</p>

<p>&middot; If no named files exist, no RCS, ClearCase,
Perforce, or SCCS master was found, some names are given,
patch is not conforming to POSIX, and the patch appears to
create a file, patch selects the best name requiring the
creation of the fewest directories.</p>

<p>&middot; If no file name results from the above
heuristics, you are asked for the name of the file to patch,
and patch selects that name.</p>

<p>To determine the best of a nonempty list of file names,
patch first takes all the names with the fewest path name
components; of those, it then takes all the names with the
shortest basename; of those, it then takes all the shortest
names; finally, it takes the first remaining name.</p>

<p>Additionally, if the leading garbage contains a Prereq:
line, patch takes the first word from the prerequisites line
(normally a version number) and checks the original file to
see if that word can be found. If not, patch asks for
confirmation before proceeding.</p>

<p>The upshot of all this is that you should be able to
say, while in a news interface, something like the
following:</p>

<p>| patch -d /usr/src/local/blurfl</p>

<p>and patch a file in the blurfl directory directly from
the article con- taining the patch.</p>

<p>If the patch file contains more than one patch, patch
tries to apply each of them as if they came from separate
patch files. This means, among other things, that it is
assumed that the name of the file to patch must be
determined for each diff listing, and that the garbage
before each diff listing contains interesting things such as
file names and revision level, as mentioned previously.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -b or --backup Make backup files. That is, when
patching a file, rename or copy the original instead of
removing it. When backing up a file that does not exist, an
empty, unreadable backup file is created as a placeholder to
represent the nonexistent file. See the -V or --ver-
sion-control option for details about how backup file names
are determined.</p>

<p>--backup-if-mismatch Back up a file if the patch does
not match the file exactly and if backups are not otherwise
requested. This is the default unless patch is conforming to
POSIX.</p>

<p>--no-backup-if-mismatch Do not back up a file if the
patch does not match the file exactly and if backups are not
otherwise requested. This is the default if patch is
conforming to POSIX.</p>

<p>-B pref or --prefix=pref Use the simple method to
determine backup file names (see the -V method or
--version-control method option), and append pref to a file
name when generating its backup file name. For example, with
-B /junk/ the simple backup file name for src/patch/util.c
is /junk/src/patch/util.c.</p>

<p>--binary Write all files in binary mode, except for
standard output and /dev/tty. When reading, disable the
heuristic for transforming CRLF line endings into LF line
endings. (On POSIX-conforming systems, reads and writes
never transform line endings. On Windows, reads and writes
do transform line endings by default, and patches should be
generated by diff --binary when line endings are
significant.)</p>

<p>-c or --context Interpret the patch file as a ordinary
context diff.</p>

<p>-d dir or --directory=dir Change to the directory dir
immediately, before doing anything else.</p>

<p>-D define or --ifdef=define Use the #ifdef ... #endif
construct to mark changes, with define as the
differentiating symbol.</p>

<p>--dry-run Print the results of applying the patches
without actually changing any files.</p>

<p>-e or --ed Interpret the patch file as an ed script.</p>

<p>-E or --remove-empty-files Remove output files that are
empty after the patches have been applied. Normally this
option is unnecessary, since patch can exam- ine the time
stamps on the header to determine whether a file should
exist after patching. However, if the input is not a context
diff or if patch is conforming to POSIX, patch does not
remove empty patched files unless this option is given. When
patch removes a file, it also attempts to remove any empty
ancestor directories.</p>

<p>-f or --force Assume that the user knows exactly what he
or she is doing, and do not ask any questions. Skip patches
whose headers do not say which file is to be patched; patch
files even though they have the wrong version for the
Prereq: line in the patch; and assume that patches are not
reversed even if they look like they are. This option does
not suppress commentary; use -s for that.</p>

<p>-F num or --fuzz=num Set the maximum fuzz factor. This
option only applies to diffs that have context, and causes
patch to ignore up to that many lines in looking for places
to install a hunk. Note that a larger fuzz fac- tor
increases the odds of a faulty patch. The default fuzz
factor is 2, and it may not be set to more than the number
of lines of con- text in the context diff, ordinarily 3.</p>

<p>-g num or --get=num This option controls patchs actions
when a file is under RCS or SCCS control, and does not exist
or is read-only and matches the default version, or when a
file is under ClearCase or Perforce con- trol and does not
exist. If num is positive, patch gets (or checks out) the
file from the revision control system; if zero, patch
ignores RCS, ClearCase, Perforce, and SCCS and does not get
the file; and if negative, patch asks the user whether to
get the file. The default value of this option is given by
the value of the PATCH_GET environment variable if it is
set; if not, the default value is zero.</p>

<p>--help Print a summary of options and exit.</p>

<p>-i patchfile or --input=patchfile Read the patch from
patchfile. If patchfile is -, read from stan- dard input,
the default.</p>

<p>-l or --ignore-whitespace Match patterns loosely, in
case tabs or spaces have been munged in your files. Any
sequence of one or more blanks in the patch file matches any
sequence in the original file, and sequences of blanks at
the ends of lines are ignored. Normal characters must still
match exactly. Each line of the context must still match a
line in the original file.</p>

<p>--merge Merge a patch file into the original files
similar to merge(1). If a conflict is found, patch outputs a
warning and brackets the conflict with
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; lines. A typical conflict will
look like this:</p>

<p>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; lines from the original
file ======= lines from the patch
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>

<p>If there are conflicts, the user should edit the result
and delete one of the alternatives. This option implies
--forward and does not take the --fuzz=num option into
account.</p>

<p>-n or --normal Interpret the patch file as a normal
diff.</p>

<p>-N or --forward Ignore patches that seem to be reversed
or already applied. See also -R.</p>

<p>-o outfile or --output=outfile Send output to outfile
instead of patching files in place. Do not use this option
if outfile is one of the files to be patched. When outfile
is -, send output to standard output, and send any messages
that would usually go to standard output to standard
error.</p>

<p>-pnum or --strip=num Strip the smallest prefix
containing num leading slashes from each file name found in
the patch file. A sequence of one or more adja- cent slashes
is counted as a single slash. This controls how file names
found in the patch file are treated, in case you keep your
files in a different directory than the person who sent out
the patch. For example, supposing the file name in the patch
file was</p>

<p>/u/howard/src/blurfl/blurfl.c</p>

<p>setting -p0 gives the entire file name unmodified, -p1
gives</p>

<p>u/howard/src/blurfl/blurfl.c</p>

<p>without the leading slash, -p4 gives</p>

<p>blurfl/blurfl.c</p>

<p>and not specifying -p at all just gives you blurfl.c.
Whatever you end up with is looked for either in the current
directory, or the directory specified by the -d option.</p>

<p>--posix Conform more strictly to the POSIX standard, as
follows.</p>

<p>&middot; Take the first existing file from the list
(old, new, index) when intuiting file names from diff
headers.</p>

<p>&middot; Do not remove files that are empty after
patching.</p>

<p>&middot; Do not ask whether to get files from RCS,
ClearCase, Perforce, or SCCS.</p>

<p>&middot; Require that all options precede the files in
the command line.</p>

<p>&middot; Do not backup files when there is a
mismatch.</p>

<p>--quoting-style=word Use style word to quote output
names. The word should be one of the following:</p>

<p>literal Output names as-is.</p>

<p>shell Quote names for the shell if they contain shell
metacharac- ters or would cause ambiguous output.</p>

<p>shell-always Quote names for the shell, even if they
would normally not require quoting.</p>

<p>c Quote names as for a C language string.</p>

<p>escape Quote as with c except omit the surrounding
double-quote characters.</p>

<p>You can specify the default value of the --quoting-style
option with the environment variable QUOTING_STYLE. If that
environment vari- able is not set, the default value is
shell.</p>

<p>-r rejectfile or --reject-file=rejectfile Put rejects
into rejectfile instead of the default .rej file. When
rejectfile is -, discard rejects.</p>

<p>-R or --reverse Assume that this patch was created with
the old and new files swapped. (Yes, I m afraid that does
happen occasionally, human nature being what it is.) patch
attempts to swap each hunk around before applying it.
Rejects come out in the swapped format. The -R option does
not work with ed diff scripts because there is too lit- tle
information to reconstruct the reverse operation.</p>

<p>If the first hunk of a patch fails, patch reverses the
hunk to see if it can be applied that way. If it can, you
are asked if you want to have the -R option set. If it can
t, the patch continues to be applied normally. (Note: this
method cannot detect a reversed patch if it is a normal diff
and if the first command is an append (i.e. it should have
been a delete) since appends always succeed, due to the fact
that a null context matches anywhere. Luckily, most patches
add or change lines rather than delete them, so most
reversed normal diffs begin with a delete, which fails,
triggering the heuristic.)</p>

<p>--reject-format=format Produce reject files in the
specified format (either context or uni- fied). Without this
option, rejected hunks come out in unified diff format if
the input patch was of that format, otherwise in ordinary
context diff form.</p>

<p>-s or --silent or --quiet Work silently, unless an error
occurs.</p>

<p>-t or --batch Suppress questions like -f, but make some
different assumptions: skip patches whose headers do not
contain file names (the same as -f); skip patches for which
the file has the wrong version for the Prereq: line in the
patch; and assume that patches are reversed if they look
like they are.</p>

<p>-T or --set-time Set the modification and access times
of patched files from time stamps given in context diff
headers, assuming that the context diff headers use local
time. This option is not recommended, because patches using
local time cannot easily be used by people in other time
zones, and because local time stamps are ambiguous when
local clocks move backwards during daylight-saving time
adjustments. Instead of using this option, generate patches
with UTC and use the -Z or --set-utc option instead.</p>

<p>-u or --unified Interpret the patch file as a unified
context diff.</p>

<p>-v or --version Print out patchs revision header and
patch level, and exit.</p>

<p>-V method or --version-control=method Use method to
determine backup file names. The method can also be given by
the PATCH_VERSION_CONTROL (or, if thats not set, the VER-
SION_CONTROL) environment variable, which is overridden by
this option. The method does not affect whether backup files
are made; it affects only the names of any backup files that
are made.</p>

<p>The value of method is like the GNU Emacs
version-control vari- able; patch also recognizes synonyms
that are more descriptive. The valid values for method are
(unique abbreviations are accepted):</p>

<p>existing or nil Make numbered backups of files that
already have them, otherwise simple backups. This is the
default.</p>

<p>numbered or t Make numbered backups. The numbered backup
file name for F is F.~N~ where N is the version number.</p>

<p>simple or never Make simple backups. The -B or --prefix,
-Y or --basename-pre- fix, and -z or --suffix options
specify the simple backup file name. If none of these
options are given, then a simple backup suffix is used; it
is the value of the SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX envi- ronment
variable if set, and is .orig otherwise.</p>

<p>With numbered or simple backups, if the backup file name
is too long, the backup suffix ~ is used instead; if even
appending ~ would make the name too long, then ~ replaces
the last character of the file name.</p>

<p>--verbose Output extra information about the work being
done.</p>

<p>-x num or --debug=num Set internal debugging flags of
interest only to patch patchers.</p>

<p>-Y pref or --basename-prefix=pref Use the simple method
to determine backup file names (see the -V method or
--version-control method option), and prefix pref to the
basename of a file name when generating its backup file
name. For example, with -Y .del/ the simple backup file name
for src/patch/util.c is src/patch/.del/util.c.</p>

<p>-z suffix or --suffix=suffix Use the simple method to
determine backup file names (see the -V method or
--version-control method option), and use suffix as the
suffix. For example, with -z - the backup file name for
src/patch/util.c is src/patch/util.c-.</p>

<p>-Z or --set-utc Set the modification and access times of
patched files from time stamps given in context diff
headers, assuming that the context diff headers use
Coordinated Universal Time (UTC, often known as GMT). Also
see the -T or --set-time option.</p>

<p>The -Z or --set-utc and -T or --set-time options
normally refrain from setting a files time if the files
original time does not match the time given in the patch
header, or if its contents do not match the patch exactly.
However, if the -f or --force option is given, the file time
is set regardless.</p>

<p>Due to the limitations of diff output format, these
options cannot update the times of files whose contents have
not changed. Also, if you use these options, you should
remove (e.g. with make clean) all files that depend on the
patched files, so that later invocations of make do not get
confused by the patched files times.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT PATCH_GET This specifies whether patch gets
missing or read-only files from RCS, ClearCase, Perforce, or
SCCS by default; see the -g or --get option.</p>

<p>POSIXLY_CORRECT If set, patch conforms more strictly to
the POSIX standard by default: see the --posix option.</p>

<p>QUOTING_STYLE Default value of the --quoting-style
option.</p>

<p>SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX Extension to use for simple backup
file names instead of .orig.</p>

<p>TMPDIR, TMP, TEMP Directory to put temporary files in;
patch uses the first environ- ment variable in this list
that is set. If none are set, the default is
system-dependent; it is normally /tmp on Unix hosts.</p>

<p>VERSION_CONTROL or PATCH_VERSION_CONTROL Selects version
control style; see the -v or --version-control option.</p>

<p>FILES $TMPDIR/p* temporary files</p>

<p>/dev/tty controlling terminal; used to get answers to
questions asked of the user</p>

(1985-01).</p>

<p>NOTES FOR PATCH SENDERS There are several things you
should bear in mind if you are going to be sending out
patches.</p>

<p>Create your patch systematically. A good method is the
command diff -Naur old new where old and new identify the
old and new directo- ries. The names old and new should not
contain any slashes. The diff command s headers should have
dates and times in Universal Time using traditional Unix
format, so that patch recipients can use the -Z or --set-utc
option. Here is an example command, using Bourne shell syn-
tax:</p>

<p>LC_ALL=C TZ=UTC0 diff -Naur gcc-2.7 gcc-2.8</p>

<p>Tell your recipients how to apply the patch by telling
them which directory to cd to, and which patch options to
use. The option string -Np1 is recommended. Test your
procedure by pretending to be a recipi- ent and applying
your patch to a copy of the original files.</p>

<p>You can save people a lot of grief by keeping a
patchlevel.h file which is patched to increment the patch
level as the first diff in the patch file you send out. If
you put a Prereq: line in with the patch, it won t let them
apply patches out of order without some warning.</p>

<p>You can create a file by sending out a diff that
compares /dev/null or an empty file dated the Epoch
(1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC) to the file you want to create.
This only works if the file you want to create doesnt exist
already in the target directory. Conversely, you can remove
a file by sending out a context diff that compares the file
to be deleted with an empty file dated the Epoch. The file
will be removed unless patch is conforming to POSIX and the
-E or --remove-empty-files option is not given. An easy way
to generate patches that create and remove files is to use
GNU diffs -N or --new-file option.</p>

<p>If the recipient is supposed to use the -pN option, do
not send output that looks like this:</p>

<p>diff -Naur v2.0.29/prog/README prog/README ---
v2.0.29/prog/README Mon Mar 10 15:13:12 1997 +++ prog/README
Mon Mar 17 14:58:22 1997</p>

<p>because the two file names have different numbers of
slashes, and dif- ferent versions of patch interpret the
file names differently. To avoid confusion, send output that
looks like this instead:</p>

<p>diff -Naur v2.0.29/prog/README v2.0.30/prog/README ---
v2.0.29/prog/README Mon Mar 10 15:13:12 1997 +++
v2.0.30/prog/README Mon Mar 17 14:58:22 1997</p>

<p>Avoid sending patches that compare backup file names
like README.orig, since this might confuse patch into
patching a backup file instead of the real file. Instead,
send patches that compare the same base file names in
different directories, e.g. old/README and new/README.</p>

<p>Take care not to send out reversed patches, since it
makes people won- der whether they already applied the
patch.</p>

<p>Try not to have your patch modify derived files (e.g.
the file config- ure where there is a line configure:
configure.in in your makefile), since the recipient should
be able to regenerate the derived files any- way. If you
must send diffs of derived files, generate the diffs using
UTC, have the recipients apply the patch with the -Z or
--set-utc option, and have them remove any unpatched files
that depend on patched files (e.g. with make clean).</p>

<p>While you may be able to get away with putting 582 diff
listings into one file, it may be wiser to group related
patches into separate files in case something goes
haywire.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS Diagnostics generally indicate that patch
couldnt parse your patch file.</p>

<p>If the --verbose option is given, the message Hmm...
indicates that there is unprocessed text in the patch file
and that patch is attempt- ing to intuit whether there is a
patch in that text and, if so, what kind of patch it is.</p>

<p>patch s exit status is 0 if all hunks are applied
successfully, 1 if some hunks cannot be applied or there
were merge conflicts, and 2 if there is more serious
trouble. When applying a set of patches in a loop it
behooves you to check this exit status so you dont apply a
later patch to a partially patched file.</p>

<p>CAVEATS Context diffs cannot reliably represent the
creation or deletion of empty files, empty directories, or
special files such as symbolic links. Nor can they represent
changes to file metadata like ownership, permissions, or
whether one file is a hard link to another. If changes like
these are also required, separate instructions (e.g. a shell
script) to accomplish them should accompany the patch.</p>

<p>patch cannot tell if the line numbers are off in an ed
script, and can detect bad line numbers in a normal diff
only when it finds a change or deletion. A context diff
using fuzz factor 3 may have the same prob- lem. You should
probably do a context diff in these cases to see if the
changes made sense. Of course, compiling without errors is a
pretty good indication that the patch worked, but not
always.</p>

<p>patch usually produces the correct results, even when it
has to do a lot of guessing. However, the results are
guaranteed to be correct only when the patch is applied to
exactly the same version of the file that the patch was
generated from.</p>

<p>COMPATIBILITY ISSUES The POSIX standard specifies
behavior that differs from patchs tradi- tional behavior.
You should be aware of these differences if you must
interoperate with patch versions 2.1 and earlier, which do
not conform to POSIX.</p>

<p>&middot; In traditional patch, the -p option s operand
was optional, and a bare -p was equivalent to -p0. The -p
option now requires an operand, and -p 0 is now equivalent
to -p0. For maximum compatibil- ity, use options like -p0
and -p1.</p>

<p>Also, traditional patch simply counted slashes when
stripping path prefixes; patch now counts pathname
components. That is, a sequence of one or more adjacent
slashes now counts as a single slash. For maximum
portability, avoid sending patches containing // in file
names.</p>

<p>&middot; In traditional patch, backups were enabled by
default. This behav- ior is now enabled with the -b or
--backup option.</p>

<p>Conversely, in POSIX patch, backups are never made, even
when there is a mismatch. In GNU patch, this behavior is
enabled with the --no-backup-if-mismatch option, or by
conforming to POSIX with the --posix option or by setting
the POSIXLY_CORRECT environment vari- able.</p>

<p>The -b suffix option of traditional patch is equivalent
to the -b -z suffix options of GNU patch.</p>

<p>&middot; Traditional patch used a complicated (and
incompletely documented) method to intuit the name of the
file to be patched from the patch header. This method did
not conform to POSIX, and had a few gotchas. Now patch uses
a different, equally complicated (but bet- ter documented)
method that is optionally POSIX-conforming; we hope it has
fewer gotchas. The two methods are compatible if the file
names in the context diff header and the Index: line are all
identi- cal after prefix-stripping. Your patch is normally
compatible if each headers file names all contain the same
number of slashes.</p>

<p>&middot; When traditional patch asked the user a
question, it sent the ques- tion to standard error and
looked for an answer from the first file in the following
list that was a terminal: standard error, standard output,
/dev/tty, and standard input. Now patch sends questions to
standard output and gets answers from /dev/tty. Defaults for
some answers have been changed so that patch never goes into
an infinite loop when using default answers.</p>

<p>&middot; Traditional patch exited with a status value
that counted the number of bad hunks, or with status 1 if
there was real trouble. Now patch exits with status 1 if
some hunks failed, or with 2 if there was real trouble.</p>

<p>&middot; Limit yourself to the following options when
sending instructions meant to be executed by anyone running
GNU patch, traditional patch, or a patch that conforms to
POSIX. Spaces are significant in the following list, and
operands are required.</p>

<p>-c -d dir -D define -e -l -n -N -o outfile -pnum -R -r
rejectfile</p>

<p>BUGS Please report bugs via email to
&lt;bug-patch@gnu.org&gt;.</p>

<p>If code has been duplicated (for instance with #ifdef
OLDCODE ... #else ... #endif), patch is incapable of
patching both versions, and, if it works at all, will likely
patch the wrong one, and tell you that it succeeded to
boot.</p>

<p>If you apply a patch youve already applied, patch thinks
it is a reversed patch, and offers to un-apply the patch.
This could be con- strued as a feature.</p>

<p>Computing how to merge a hunk is significantly harder
than using the standard fuzzy algorithm. Bigger hunks, more
context, a bigger offset from the original location, and a
worse match all slow the algorithm down.</p>

<p>AUTHORS Larry Wall wrote the original version of patch.
Paul Eggert removed patchs arbitrary limits; added support
for binary files, setting file times, and deleting files;
and made it conform better to POSIX. Other contributors
