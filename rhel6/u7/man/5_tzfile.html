<p>NAME tzfile - timezone information</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tzfile.h&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The timezone information files used by
tzset(3) begin with the magic characters &quot;TZif&quot; to
identify then as timezone information files, fol- lowed by
sixteen bytes reserved for future use, followed by six four-
byte values of type long, written in a &quot;standard&quot;
byte order (the high- order byte of the value is written
first). These values are, in order:</p>

<p>tzh_ttisgmtcnt The number of UTC/local indicators stored
in the file.</p>

<p>tzh_ttisstdcnt The number of standard/wall indicators
stored in the file.</p>

<p>tzh_leapcnt The number of leap seconds for which data is
stored in the file.</p>

<p>tzh_timecnt The number of &quot;transition times&quot;
for which data is stored in the file.</p>

<p>tzh_typecnt The number of &quot;local time types&quot;
for which data is stored in the file (must not be zero).</p>

<p>tzh_charcnt The number of characters of &quot;timezone
abbreviation strings&quot; stored in the file.</p>

<p>The above header is followed by tzh_timecnt four-byte
values of type long, sorted in ascending order. These values
are written in &quot;stan- dard&quot; byte order. Each is
used as a transition time (as returned by time(2)) at which
the rules for computing local time change. Next come
tzh_timecnt one-byte values of type unsigned char; each one
tells which of the different types of &quot;local time&quot;
types described in the file is associated with the
same-indexed transition time. These values serve as indices
into an array of ttinfo structures that appears next in the
file; these structures are defined as follows:</p>

<p>struct ttinfo { long tt_gmtoff; int tt_isdst; unsigned
int tt_abbrind; };</p>

<p>Each structure is written as a four-byte value for
tt_gmtoff of type long, in a standard byte order, followed
by a one-byte value for tt_isdst and a one-byte value for
tt_abbrind. In each structure, tt_gmtoff gives the number of
seconds to be added to UTC, tt_isdst tells whether tm_isdst
should be set by localtime(3), and tt_abbrind serves as an
index into the array of timezone abbreviation characters
that follow the ttinfo structure(s) in the file.</p>

<p>Then there are tzh_leapcnt pairs of four-byte values,
written in stan- dard byte order; the first value of each
pair gives the time (as returned by time(2)) at which a leap
second occurs; the second gives the total number of leap
seconds to be applied after the given time. The pairs of
values are sorted in ascending order by time.</p>

<p>Then there are tzh_ttisstdcnt standard/wall indicators,
each stored as a one-byte value; they tell whether the
transition times associated with local time types were
specified as standard time or wall clock time, and are used
when a timezone file is used in handling POSIX-style
timezone environment variables.</p>

<p>Finally, there are tzh_ttisgmtcnt UTC/local indicators,
each stored as a one-byte value; they tell whether the
transition times associated with local time types were
specified as UTC or local time, and are used when a timezone
file is used in handling POSIX-style timezone environ- ment
variables.</p>

<p>Localtime uses the first standard-time ttinfo structure
in the file (or simply the first ttinfo structure in the
absence of a standard-time structure) if either tzh_timecnt
is zero or the time argument is less than the first
transition time recorded in the file.</p>
