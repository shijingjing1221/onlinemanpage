<p>NAME cups-deviced - cups device daemon</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS cups-deviced request-id limit user-id
options</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION cups-deviced polls the backends in
/usr/lib/cups/backend for a list of available devices. It is
run by cupsd(8) in response to a CUPS-Get- Devices request.
The output format is an IPP response message. The request-id
argument is the request ID from the original IPP request,
typically 1. The limit argument is the limit value from the
original IPP request - 0 means no limit. The user-id
argument is the requesting- user-name value from the
original IPP request. Finally, the options argument is a
space-delimited list of attributes (&quot;name=value
name=value ...&quot;) that were passed in with the request.
Currently cups- deviced looks for the requested-attributes
attribute and tailors the output accordingly.</p>
