<p>NAME pmevent - report event record details</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pmevent [-gLz] [-a archive] [-h host] [-K spec]
[-O offset] [-p port] [-S starttime] [-s samples] [-T
endtime] [-t interval] [-x pattern] [-Z timezone] metricname
...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) supports event
records within the framework for fetching general
performance information. pmevent prints current or archived
values for the nominated event record metrics. The event
records of interest are contained in one or more of the
metrics identi- fied by the metricname arguments.</p>

<p>Unless directed to another host by the -h option, or to
an archive by the -a option or to a local context by the -L
option, pmevent will con- tact the Performance Metrics
Collector Daemon (PMCD) on the local host to obtain the
required information. The -a,-h and -L options are mutu-
ally exclusive.</p>

<p>The metricname arguments may be given in the metric
specification syn- tax, as described in PCPIntro(1), where
the source and metric name may all be included in the
metricname, e.g. thathost:someagent.event.records or
myarchive/someagent.event.records[ foo-instance ,
bar-instance]. When this format is used, any of the -h or -a
or -L options may also be specified, provided the usage is
consistent in terms of the source of the metrics identified
by the options as compared to any explicit source of the
metrics defined in the metricname arguments.</p>

<p>When using the metric specification syntax, the hostname
@ is treated specially and causes pmevent to use a local
context to collect metrics from PMDAs on the local host
without PMCD (same as the -L option). Only some metrics are
available in this mode.</p>

<p>The -S, -T and -O options may be used to define a time
window to restrict the samples retrieved, set an initial
origin within the time window; refer to PCPIntro(1) for a
complete description of these options.</p>

<p>When processing an archive, pmevent may relinquish its
own timing con- trol, and operate as a slave of a pmtime(1)
process that uses a GUI dialog to provide timing control. In
this case, either the -g option should be used to start
pmevent as the sole slave of a new pmtime(1) instance, or -p
should be used to attach pmevent to an existing pmtime(1)
instance via the IPC channel identified by the port
argument.</p>

<p>The other options that control the information reported
by pmevent are as follows:</p>

<p>-a Performance metric values are retrieved from the PCP
archive log file identified by the base name archive.</p>

<p>-g Start pmevent as the slave of a new pmtime(1) process
for replay of archived performance data using the pmtime(1)
graphical user interface.</p>

<p>-h Current performance metric values are retrieved from
the nominated host machine.</p>

<p>-K When fetching metrics from a local context, the -K
option may be used to control the DSO PMDAs that should be
made accessible. The spec argument conforms to the syntax
described in __pmSpecLocalP- MDA(3). More than one -K option
may be used.</p>

<p>-L Causes pmevent to use a local context to collect
metrics from PMDAs on the local host without PMCD. Only some
metrics are available in this mode.</p>

<p>-p Attach pmevent to an existing pmtime(1) time control
process instance via the IPC channel identified by the port
argument. This option is normally only used by other tools,
e.g. pmchart(1), when they launch pmevent with synchronized
time con- trol.</p>

<p>-s The argument samples defines the number of samples to
be retrieved and reported. If samples is 0 or -s is not
specified, pmevent will sample and report continuously (in
real time mode) or until the end of the PCP archive (in
archive mode).</p>

<p>It is not possible to control the number of event
records, as each value of a metricname may deliver zero, one
or more event records. The -s option determines how many
times pmevent will retrieve val- ues for the specified
metricname metrics.</p>

<p>-t The default sampling interval may be set to something
other than the default 1 second. The interval argument
follows the syntax described in PCPIntro(1), and in the
simplest form may be an unsigned integer (the implied units
in this case are seconds).</p>

<p>For PCP archives, pmevent will retrieve all of the event
records for the metricname metrics within the requested time
window, so the value of the sampling interval will have no
effect in this case.</p>

<p>-x The given filter is sent to the performance metric
domain agent for the requested metricname before any values
are requested. This serves two purposes. Firstly, it
provides a mechanism for server-side event filtering that is
customisable for individual event streams. In addition, some
performance metrics domain agents also use the PMCD store
mechanism to provide a basic secu- rity model (e.g. for
sensitive log files, only a client host with pmStore(3)
access would be able to access the event stream).</p>

<p>-Z By default, pmevent reports the time of day according
to the local timezone on the system where pmevent is run.
The -Z option changes the timezone to timezone in the format
of the environment variable TZ as described in
environ(5).</p>

<p>-z Change the reporting timezone to the local timezone
at the host that is the source of the performance metrics,
as identified via either the metricname or the -h or -a or
-L options.</p>

<p>The output from pmevent is directed to standard
output.</p>
