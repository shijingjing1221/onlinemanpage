<p>NAME flush - Flush buffered output for a channel</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS flush channelId
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Flushes any output that has been buffered
for channelId.</p>

<p>ChannelId must be an identifier for an open channel such
as a Tcl stan- dard channel (stdout or stderr), the return
value from an invocation of open or socket, or the result of
a channel creation command provided by a Tcl extension. The
channel must have been opened for writing.</p>

<p>If the channel is in blocking mode the command does not
return until all the buffered output has been flushed to the
channel. If the channel is in nonblocking mode, the command
may return before all buffered out- put has been flushed;
the remainder will be flushed in the background as fast as
the underlying file or device is able to absorb it.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE Prompt for the user to type some information in
on the console: puts -nonewline &quot;Please type your name:
&quot; flush stdout gets stdin name puts &quot;Hello there,
$name!&quot;</p>
