<p>NAME pminfo - display information about performance
metrics</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pminfo [-dfFLmMtTvxz] [-a archive] [-b
batchsize] [-c dmfile] [-h host- name] [-K spec] [-[n|N]
pmnsfile] [-O time] [-Z timezone] [metricname ...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pminfo displays various types of information
about performance metrics available through the facilities
of the Performance Co-Pilot (PCP).</p>

<p>Normally pminfo operates on the distributed Performance
Metrics Name Space (PMNS), however if the -n option is
specified an alternative local PMNS is loaded from the file
pmnsfile. The -N option supports the same function as -n,
except for the handling of duplicate Perfor- mance Metric
Identifiers (PMIDs) in pmnsfile - duplicate names for the
same PMID are allowed with -n they are not allowed with
-N.</p>

<p>The metrics of interest are named in the metricname
arguments. If met- ricname is a non-leaf node in the PMNS,
then pminfo will recursively descend the PMNS and report on
all leaf nodes. If no metricname argu- ment is given, the
root of the PMNS is used.</p>

<p>Unless directed to another host by the -h option, by
default pminfo will contact the Performance Metrics
Collector Daemon (PMCD) on the local host. The connection to
a PMCD is only required if pminfo requires distributed PMNS
information, and/or meta-data describing met- rics, and/or
metric values, and/or help text.</p>

<p>The -a option causes pminfo to use the specified archive
rather than connecting to a PMCD. The -a , -h and -L options
are mutually exclu- sive.</p>

<p>The -L option causes pminfo to use a local context to
collect metrics from PMDAs on the local host without PMCD.
Only some metrics are available in this mode. The -a,-h and
-L options are mutually exclu- sive.</p>

<p>The -b option may be used to define the maximum size of
the group of metrics to be fetched in a single request for
the -f and -v options. The default value for batchsize is
20.</p>

<p>Other options control the specific information to be
reported.</p>

<p>-c The dmfile argument specifies a file that contains
derived metric definitions in the format described for
pmLoadDerivedConfig(3). The -c option provides a way to load
derived metric definitions that is an alternative to the
more generic use of the PCP_DERIVED_CONFIG environment
variable as described in PCPIn- tro(1). Using the -c option
and the PCP_DERIVED_CONFIG environ- ment variable to specify
the same configuration is a bad idea, so choose one or the
other method.</p>

<p>-d Metric descriptions detailing the PMID, data type,
data semantics, units, scale and associated instance
domain.</p>

<p>-f Fetch and print values for all instances. When
fetching from an archive, only those instances present in
the first archive record for a metric will be displayed; see
also the -O option, else use pmdumplog(1) which may be a
better tool for examining archives.</p>

<p>-F Same as -f but try harder to fetch instances for
metrics which have non-enumerable instance domains (e.g.
metrics in the proc subtree of the default PMNS).</p>

<p>-K When using the -L option to fetch metrics from a
local context, the -K option may be used to control the DSO
PMDAs that should be made accessible. The spec argument
conforms to the syntax described in __pmSpecLocalPMDA(3).
More than one -K option may be used.</p>

<p>-m Print the PMID in terse mode.</p>

<p>-M Print the PMID in verbose mode.</p>

<p>-O When used in conjunction with an archive source of
metrics and the options -f or -F, the time argument defines
a time origin at which the metrics should be fetched from
the archive. Refer to PCPIn- tro(1) for a complete
description of this option, and the syntax for the time
argument.</p>

<p>When the ctime format is used for the time argument in a
-O option, the timezone becomes an issue. The default is to
use the local timezone on the system where pminfo is run.
The -Z option changes the timezone to timezone in the format
of the environment variable TZ as described in environ(5).
The -z option changes the timezone to the local timezone at
the host that is the source of the performance metrics, as
identified via the -a option.</p>

<p>-t Print the one line help summary, if available.</p>

<p>-T Print the help text, if available.</p>

<p>-v Verify mode in which descriptions and values are
retrieved, but only error conditions are reported. This
option silently disables any output from the options -f, -M,
-m, -t and -T.</p>

<p>-x Like the -f option, but with the additional
functionality that if a value is processed that is of type
PM_TYPE_EVENT, then the event records will be unpacked and
the details of each event record reported.</p>

<p>FILES $PCP_VAR_DIR/pmns/* default local PMNS
specification files</p>

<p>PCP ENVIRONMENT Environment variables with the prefix
PCP_ are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP. On each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in pcp.conf(5).</p>
