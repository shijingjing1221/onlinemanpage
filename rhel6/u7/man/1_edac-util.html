<p>EDAC-UTIL(1) EDAC error reporting utility
EDAC-UTIL(1)</p>

<p>NAME edac-util - EDAC error reporting utility.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS edac-util [OPTION]...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The edac-util program reads information from
EDAC (Error Detection and Correction) drivers in the kernel,
using files exported by these drivers in sysfs. With no
options, edac-util will report any uncor- rected error (UE)
or corrected error (CE) information recorded by EDAC, along
with any DIMM label information registered with EDAC.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -h, --help Display a summary of the command-line
options.</p>

<p>-q, --quiet Quiet mode. For some reports, edac-util will
report corrected and uncorrected error counts for all MC,
csrow, and channel com- binations, even if the current count
of errors is zero. The --quiet flag will suppress the
display of any locations with zero errors, thus creating a
more terse report. No output will be generated if there are
zero total errors currently recorded by EDAC. Additionally,
the use of --quiet will suppress all informational and debug
messages, displaying only fatal errors.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose Increase verbosity. Multiple -v&acute;s
may be used.</p>

<p>-s, --status Displays the current status of EDAC
drivers. edac-util will report whether it detects that EDAC
drivers are loaded, and the number of memory controllers
(MCs) found in sysfs. In verbose mode, the MC id and name of
each controller will also be printed.</p>

<p>-r, --report=report,... Specify the report to generate.
Currently, the available reports are default, simple, full,
ue, and ce. These reports are detailed in the EDAC REPORTS
section below. More than one report may be specified in a
comma-separated list.</p>

<p>EDAC REPORTS default The default edac-util report is
generated when the program is run without any options. If
there are no errors logged by EDAC, this report will display
&quot;No errors to report.&quot; to stdout. Oth- erwise,
error counts for each MC, csrow, channel combination with
attributed errors are displayed, along with corresponding
DIMM labels, if these labels have been registered in
sysfs.</p>

<p>The default report will also display any errors that do
not have any DIMM information. These errors occur when
errors are reported in the memory controller overflow
register, indicating that more than one error occurred
during a given EDAC poll cycle. It is usually obvious from
which DIMM locations these errors were generated.</p>

<p>simple The simple report reports total corrected and
uncorrected errors for each MC detected on the system. It
also displays a tally of total errors. With the --quiet
option, only non-zero error counts are displayed.</p>

<p>full The full report generates a line of output for
every MC, csrow, channel combination found in EDAC sysfs.
This includes counts of errors with no information
(&quot;noinfo&quot; errors). Output is of the form:</p>

<p>MC:(csrow|noinfo):(label|all):(UE|CE):count</p>

<p>With the --quiet option, only non-zero error counts will
be dis- played.</p>

<p>ue This report simply displays the total number of
Uncorrected Errors (UEs) detected on the system. With the
--quiet option, output will be suppressed unless there are 1
or more errors to report.</p>

<p>ce This report simply displays the total number of
Corrected Errors (CEs) detected on the system. With the
--quiet option, output will be suppressed unless there are 1
or more errors to report.</p>
