<p>NAME pvscan scan all disks for physical volumes</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pvscan [--commandprofile ProfileName]
[-d|--debug] [-h|--help] [-v|--verbose] [--version]
[--ignorelockingfailure] [-e|--exported]
[-n|--novolumegroup] [-s|--short] [-u|--uuid]</p>

<p>pvscan [-d|--debug] [-h|--help] --cache [-a|--activate
ay] [-b|--back- ground] [--major major --minor minor |
DevicePath | major:minor]...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pvscan scans all supported LVM block devices
in the system for physical volumes.</p>

<p>OPTIONS See lvm(8) for common options.</p>

<p>-e, --exported Only show physical volumes belonging to
exported volume groups.</p>

<p>-n, --novolumegroup Only show physical volumes not
belonging to any volume group.</p>

<p>-s, --short Short listing format.</p>

<p>-u, --uuid Show UUIDs (Uniform Unique Identifiers) in
addition to device special names.</p>

<p>-a, --activate ay Together with the information already
cached in lvmetad, auto- matically activate any logical
volumes that become activatable after the scan done on one
or more devices. The logical volume to autoactivate is
matched against the activation/auto_activa- tion_volume_list
set in lvm.conf. If this list is not set, then all volumes
are considered for autoactivation. The autoactiva- tion is
not yet supported for logical volumes that are part of
partial or clustered volume groups.</p>

<p>-b, --background Run the command in the background.</p>

<p>--cache [--major major --minor minor | DevicePath |
major:minor ]... Scan one or more devices and instruct the
lvmetad daemon to update its cached state accordingly.
Called internally by udev rules. All devices listed
explicitly are processed regardless of any device filters
set using devices/filter configuration setting. To filter
devices even in this case, the devices/global_filter must be
used. If lvmetad has not yet cached any metadata or the
filters have recently been changed, then all devices may be
scanned, effectively ignoring the rest of the command line.
Otherwise, if all the devices referenced on the command line
contain metadata in the default lvm2 format, other devices
are not accessed. If metadata written using the obsolete GFS
pool or lvm1 format is encountered, this is ignored and so
lvmetad should not be used. To notify lvmetad about a device
that is not present in the system anymore, --major and
--minor pair of that device must be always supplied, not
Devi- cePath as pvscan is not able to translate the
DevicePath into major and minor pair which lvmetad
requires.</p>
