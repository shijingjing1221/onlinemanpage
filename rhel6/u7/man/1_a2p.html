<p>NAME a2p - Awk to Perl translator</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS a2p [options] [filename]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION A2p takes an awk script specified on the
command line (or from standard input) and produces a
comparable perl script on the standard output.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Options include:</p>

<p>-D&lt;number&gt; sets debugging flags.</p>

<p>-F&lt;character&gt; tells a2p that this awk script is
always invoked with this -F switch.</p>

<p>-n&lt;fieldlist&gt; specifies the names of the input
fields if input does not have to be split into an array. If
you were translating an awk script that processes the
password file, you might say:</p>

<p>a2p -7 -nlogin.password.uid.gid.gcos.shell.home</p>

<p>Any delimiter can be used to separate the field
names.</p>

<p>-&lt;number&gt; causes a2p to assume that input will
always have that many fields.</p>

<p>-o tells a2p to use old awk behavior. The only current
differences are:</p>

<p>&middot; Old awk always has a line loop, even if there
are no line actions, whereas new awk does not.</p>

<p>&middot; In old awk, sprintf is extremely greedy about
its arguments. For example, given the statement</p>

<p>print sprintf(some_args), extra_args;</p>

<p>old awk considers extra_args to be arguments to
&quot;sprintf&quot;; new awk considers them arguments to
&quot;print&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;Considerations&quot; A2p cannot do as good a job
translating as a human would, but it usually does pretty
well. There are some areas where you may want to examine the
perl script produced and tweak it some. Here are some of
them, in no particular order.</p>

<p>There is an awk idiom of putting int() around a string
expression to force numeric interpretation, even though the
argument is always integer anyway. This is generally
unneeded in perl, but a2p cant tell if the argument is
always going to be integer, so it leaves it in. You may wish
to remove it.</p>

<p>Perl differentiates numeric comparison from string
comparison. Awk has one operator for both that decides at
run time which comparison to do. A2p does not try to do a
complete job of awk emulation at this point. Instead it
guesses which one you want. Its almost always right, but it
can be spoofed. All such guesses are marked with the comment
&quot;&quot;#???&quot;&quot;. You should go through and
check them. You might want to run at least once with the -w
switch to perl, which will warn you if you use == where you
should have used eq.</p>

<p>Perl does not attempt to emulate the behavior of awk in
which nonexistent array elements spring into existence
simply by being referenced. If somehow you are relying on
this mechanism to create null entries for a subsequent
for...in, they wont be there in perl.</p>

<p>If a2p makes a split line that assigns to a list of
variables that looks like (Fld1, Fld2, Fld3...) you may want
to rerun a2p using the -n option mentioned above. This will
let you name the fields throughout the script. If it splits
to an array instead, the script is probably referring to the
number of fields somewhere.</p>

<p>The exit statement in awk doesnt necessarily exit; it
goes to the END block if there is one. Awk scripts that do
contortions within the END block to bypass the block under
such circumstances can be simplified by removing the
conditional in the END block and just exiting directly from
the perl script.</p>

<p>Perl has two kinds of array, numerically-indexed and
associative. Perl associative arrays are called
&quot;hashes&quot;. Awk arrays are usually translated to
hashes, but if you happen to know that the index is always
going to be numeric you could change the {...} to [...].
Iteration over a hash is done using the keys() function, but
iteration over an array is NOT. You might need to modify any
loop that iterates over such an array.</p>

<p>Awk starts by assuming OFMT has the value %.6g. Perl
starts by assuming its equivalent, $#, to have the value
%.20g. You ll want to set $# explicitly if you use the
default value of OFMT.</p>

<p>Near the top of the line loop will be the split
operation that is implicit in the awk script. There are
times when you can move this down past some conditionals
that test the entire record so that the split is not done as
often.</p>

<p>For aesthetic reasons you may wish to change the array
base $[ from 1 back to perls default of 0, but remember to
change all array subscripts AND all substr() and index()
operations to match.</p>

<p>Cute comments that say &quot;# Here is a workaround
because awk is dumb&quot; are passed through unmodified.</p>

<p>Awk scripts are often embedded in a shell script that
pipes stuff into and out of awk. Often the shell script
wrapper can be incorporated into the perl script, since perl
can start up pipes into and out of itself, and can do other
things that awk can t do by itself.</p>

<p>Scripts that refer to the special variables RSTART and
RLENGTH can often be simplified by referring to the
variables $ , $&amp; and $, as long as they are within the
scope of the pattern match that sets them.</p>

<p>The produced perl script may have subroutines defined to
deal with awk s semantics regarding getline and print. Since
a2p usually picks correctness over efficiency. it is almost
always possible to rewrite such code to be more efficient by
discarding the semantic sugar.</p>

<p>For efficiency, you may wish to remove the keyword from
any return statement that is the last statement executed in
a subroutine. A2p catches the most common case, but doesnt
analyze embedded blocks for subtler cases.</p>

<p>ARGV[0] translates to $ARGV0, but ARGV[n] translates to
$ARGV[$n]. A loop that tries to iterate over ARGV[0] wont
find it.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT A2p uses no environment variables.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS BUGS It would be possible to emulate awks
behavior in selecting string versus numeric operations at
run time by inspection of the operands, but it would be
gross and inefficient. Besides, a2p almost always guesses
right.</p>

<p>Storage for the awk syntax tree is currently static, and
can run out.</p>
