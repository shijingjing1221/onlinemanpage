<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>ppmcie creates a PPM file containing a plot of the CIE
tongue color chart -- to the extent possible in a PPM image.
Alternatively, creates a pseudo-PPM image of the color
tongue using RGB values from a color system of your
choice.</p>

<p>The CIE color tongue is an image of all the hues that
can be described by CIE X-Y chromaticity coordinates. They
are arranged on a two dimen- sional coordinate plane with
the X chromaticity on the horizontal axis and the Y
chromaticity on the vertical scale. (You can choose alterna-
tively to use CIE u-v chromaticity coordinates, but the
general idea of the color tongue is the same).</p>

<p>Note that the PPM format specifies that the RGB values
in the file are from the ITU-R Recommendation BT.709 color
system, gamma-corrected. And positive. See
ppm(1)fordetails.If you use one of the color system options
on ppmcie, what you get is not a true PPM image, but is very
similar. If you display such ppmcie output using a device
that expects PPM input (which includes just about any
computer graphics display pro- gram), it will display the
wrong colors.</p>

<p>However, you may have a device that expects one of these
variations on PPM.</p>

<p>In every RGB color system you can specify, including the
default (which produces a true PPM image) there are hues in
the color tongue that can t be represented. For example,
monochromatic blue-green with a wavelength of 500nm cannot
be represented in a PPM image.</p>

<p>For these hues, ppmcie substitutes a similar hue as
follows: They are desaturated and rendered as the shade
where the edge of the Maxwell triangle intersects a line
drawn from the requested shade to the white point defined by
the color system s white point. Furthermore, unless you
specify the -full option, ppmcie reduces their intensity by
25% compared to the true hues in the image.</p>

<p>ppmcie draws and labels the CIE X-Y coordinate axes
unless you choose otherwise with options.</p>

<p>ppmcie draws the Maxwell triangle for the color system
in use on the color tongue. The Maxwell triangle is the
triangle whose vertices are the primary illuminant hues for
the color system. The hues inside the triangle show the
color gamut for the color system. They are also the only
ones that are correct for the CIE X-Y chromaticity
coordinates shown. (See explanation above). ppmcie denotes
the Maxwell triangle by rendering it at full brightness,
while rendering the rest of the color tongue as 3/4
brightness. You can turn this off with options.</p>

<p>ppmcie also places a black cross at the color systems
white point (with the center of the cross open so you can
actually see the white color) and displays in text the CIE
X-Y chromaticities of the primary illuminants and white
point for the color system. You can turn this off with
options, though.</p>

<p>ppmcie annotates the periphery of the color tongue with
the wavelength, in nanometers of the monochromatic hues
which appear there.</p>

<p>ppmcie displays the black body chromaticity curve for
Planckian radia- tors from 1000 to 30000 kelvins on the
image. This curve traces the colors of black bodies as
various temperatures.</p>

<p>You can choose from several standard color systems, or
specify one of your own numerically.</p>

<p>CIE charts, by their very nature, contain a very large
number of col- ors. If you re encoding the chart for a color
mapped device or file format, youll need to use pnmquant or
ppmdither to reduce the number of colors in the image.</p>

<p>OPTIONS You may abbreviate any option to its shortest
unique prefix.</p>

<p>-rec709</p>

<p>-cie</p>

<p>-ebu</p>

<p>-hdtv</p>

<p>-ntsc</p>

<p>-smpte Select a standard color system whose gamut to
plot. The default is -rec709, which chooses ITU-R
Recommendation BT.709, gamma- corrected. This is the only
color system for which ppmcies output is a true PPM image.
See explanation above. -ebu chooses the primaries used in
the PAL and SECAM broadcasting standards. -ntsc chooses the
primaries specified by the NTSC broadcasting system (few
modern monitors actually cover this range). -smpte selects
the primaries recommended by the Society of Motion Picture
and Television Engineers (SMPTE) in standards RP-37 and
RP-145, and -hdtv uses the much broader HDTV ideal
primaries. -cie chooses a color system that has the largest
possible gamut within the spectrum of the chart. This is the
same color system as you get with the -cie option to John
Walkers cietoppm program.</p>

<p>-xy plot CIE 1931 x y chromaticities. This is the
default.</p>

<p>-upvp plot u v 1976 chromaticities rather than CIE 1931
x y chro- maticities. The advantage of u v coordinates is
that equal intervals of distance on the u v plane correspond
roughly to the eyes ability to discriminate colors.</p>

<p>-red rx ry specifies the CIE x and y co-ordinates of the
red illuminant of a custom color system and selects the
custom system.</p>

<p>-green gx gy specifies the CIE x and y co-ordinates of
the green illuminant of the color system and selects the
custom system.</p>

<p>-blue bx by specifies the CIE x and y co-ordinates of
the blue illuminant of the color system and selects the
custom system.</p>

<p>-white wx wy specifies the CIE x and y co-ordinates of
the white point of the color system and selects the custom
system.</p>

<p>-size edge Create an image of edge by edge pixels. The
default is 512x512.</p>

<p>-xsize|-width width Sets the width of the generated
image to width pixels. The default width is 512 pixels. If
the height and width of the image are not the same, the CIE
diagram will be stretched in the longer dimension.</p>

<p>-ysize|-height height Sets the height of the generated
image to height pixels. The default height is 512 pixels. If
the height and width of the image are not the same, the CIE
diagram will be stretched in the longer dimension.</p>

<p>-noblack Dont plot the black body chromaticity
curve.</p>

<p>-nowpoint Dont plot the color systems white point.</p>

<p>-nolabel Omit the label.</p>

<p>-noaxes Dont plot axes.</p>

<p>-full Plot the entire CIE tongue in full brightness;
dont dim the part which is outside the gamut of the
specified color system (i.e. outside the Maxwell
triangle).</p>

<p>INTERPRETATION OF COLOR CHART A color spectrum is a
linear combination of one or more monochromatic colors.</p>

<p>A color is a set of color spectra that all look the same
to the human eye (and brain). Actually, for the purposes of
the definition, we assume the eye has infinite precision, so
we can call two color spectra different colors even though
they re so close a person couldnt possi- bly tell them
apart.</p>

<p>The eye contains 3 kinds of color receptors (cones).
Each has a dif- ferent response to the various monochromatic
colors. One kind responds most strongly to blue, another
red, another green. Because there are only three, many
different color spectra will excite the cones at exactly the
same level, so the eye cannot tell them apart. All such
spectra that excite the cones in the same way are a single
color.</p>

<p>Each point in the color tongue represents a unique
color. But there are an infinite number of color spectra in
the set that is that color; i.e. an infinite number of color
spectra that would look to you like this point. A machine
could tell them apart, but you could not.</p>

<p>Remember that the colors outside the highlighted
triangle are approxi- mations of the real colors because the
PPM format cannot represent them (and your display device
probably cannot display them). That is, unless youre using a
variation of PPM and a special display device, as discussed
earlier in this manual.</p>

<p>A color is always relative to some given maximum
brightness. A partic- ular beam of light looks lime green if
in a dim field, but pea green if in a bright field. An image
on a movie screen may look pitch black because the projector
is not shining any light on it, but when you turn off the
projector and look at the same spot in room light, the
screen looks quite white. The same light from that spot hit
your eye with the project on as with it off.</p>

<p>The chart shows two dimensions of color. The third is
intensity. All the colors in the chart have the same
intensity. To get all possible colors in the gamut, Make
copies of the whole chart at every intensity between zero
and the maximum.</p>

<p>The edge of the tongue consists of all the monochromatic
colors. A monochromatic color is one with a single
wavelength. I.e. a color that is in a rainbow. The numbers
you see are the wavelengths in nanome- ters.</p>

<p>Any straight line segment within the tongue contains
colors which are linear combinations of two colors -- the
colors at either end of the line segment.</p>

<p>Any color in the chart can be created from two other
colors (actually, from any of an infinite number of pairs of
other colors).</p>

<p>All the colors within a triangle inside the tongue can
be created from a linear combination of the colors at the
vertices of that triangle.</p>

<p>Any color in the tongue can be created from at most 3
monochromatic colors.</p>

<p>The highlighted triangle shows the colors that can be
expressed in the tristimulus color system you chose. (ITU-R
BT.709 by default). The corners of the triangle are the 3
primary illuminants in that system (a certain red, green,
and blue for BT.709). The edges of the triangle, then,
represent the colors you can represent with two of the
primary illuminants (saturated colors), and the interior
colors require all three primary illuminants (are not
saturated).</p>

<p>In the ITU-R BT.709 color system (the default), the
white point is defined as D65, which is (and is named after)
the color of a black body at 6502 kelvins. Therefore, you
should see the temperature curve on the image pass through
the white part of the image, and the cross that marks the
white point, at 6502 kelvins.</p>

<p>D65 white is supposed to be the color of the sun. If you
have a per- fect BT.709 display device, you should see the
color of the sun at the white point cross. Thats an
important color, because when you look at an object in
sunlight, the color that reflects of the object is based on
the color of sunlight. Note that the sun produces a
particular color spectrum, but many other color spectra are
the same color, and display devices never use the actual
color spectrum of the sun.</p>

<p>The colors at the corners of the triangle have the
chromaticities phos- phors in a monitor that uses the
selected color system. Note that in BT.709 they are very
close to monochromatic red, green, and blue, but not quite.
Thats why you cant display even one true color of the
rainbow on a video monitor.</p>

<p>Remember that the chart shows colors of constant
intensity, therefore the corners of the triangles are not
the full colors of the primary illuminants, but only their
chromaticities. In fact, the illuminants typically have
different intensities. In BT.709, the blue primary
illuminant is far more intense than the green, which is more
intense than the red. Designers did this in order to make an
equal combination of red, green, and blue generate gray.
I.e. a combination of full strength red, full strength
green, and full strength blue BT.709 pri- mary illuminants
is D65 white.</p>

<p>The tongue has a sharp straight edge at the bottom
because thats the limit of human vision. There are colors
below that line, but they involve infrared and ultraviolet
light, so you cant see them. This line is called the line of
purples.</p>
