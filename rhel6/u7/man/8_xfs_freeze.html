<p>NAME xfs_freeze - suspend access to an XFS
filesystem</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS xfs_freeze -f | -u mount-point</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION xfs_freeze suspends and resumes access to an
XFS filesystem (see xfs(5)).</p>

<p>xfs_freeze halts new access to the filesystem and
creates a stable image on disk. xfs_freeze is intended to be
used with volume managers and hardware RAID devices that
support the creation of snapshots.</p>

<p>The mount-point argument is the pathname of the
directory where the filesystem is mounted. The filesystem
must be mounted to be frozen (see mount(8)).</p>

<p>The -f flag requests the specified XFS filesystem to be
frozen from new modifications. When this is selected, all
ongoing transactions in the filesystem are allowed to
complete, new write system calls are halted, other calls
which modify the filesystem are halted, and all dirty data,
metadata, and log information are written to disk. Any
process attempting to write to the frozen filesystem will
block waiting for the filesystem to be unfrozen.</p>

<p>Note that even after freezing, the on-disk filesystem
can contain information on files that are still in the
process of unlinking. These files will not be unlinked until
the filesystem is unfrozen or a clean mount of the snapshot
is complete.</p>

<p>The -u flag is used to un-freeze the filesystem and
allow operations to continue. Any filesystem modifications
that were blocked by the freeze are unblocked and allowed to
complete.</p>

<p>One of -f or -u must be supplied to xfs_freeze.</p>

<p>NOTES A copy of a frozen XFS filesystem will usually
have the same univer- sally unique identifier (UUID) as the
original, and thus may be pre- vented from being mounted.
The XFS nouuid mount option can be used to circumvent this
issue.</p>

<p>In Linux kernel version 2.6.29, the interface which XFS
uses to freeze and unfreeze was elevated to the VFS, so that
this tool can now be used on many other Linux
filesystems.</p>
