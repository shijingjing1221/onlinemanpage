<p>AIO_RETURN(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
AIO_RETURN(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME aio_return - retrieve return status of an
asynchronous I/O operation (REALTIME)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;aio.h&gt;</p>

<p>ssize_t aio_return(struct aiocb *aiocbp);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The aio_return() function shall return the
return status associated with the aiocb structure referenced
by the aiocbp argument. The return status for an
asynchronous I/O operation is the value that would be
returned by the corresponding read(), write(), or fsync()
function call. If the error status for the operation is
equal to [EINPROGRESS], then the return status for the
operation is undefined. The aio_return() function may be
called exactly once to retrieve the return status of a given
asynchronous operation; thereafter, if the same aiocb
structure is used in a call to aio_return() or aio_error(),
an error may be returned. When the aiocb structure referred
to by aiocbp is used to submit another asynchronous
operation, then aio_return() may be suc- cessfully used to
retrieve the return status of that operation.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE If the asynchronous I/O operation has
completed, then the return sta- tus, as described for
read(), write(), and fsync(), shall be returned. If the
asynchronous I/O operation has not yet completed, the
results of aio_return() are undefined.</p>

<p>ERRORS The aio_return() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The aiocbp argument does not refer to an
asynchronous operation whose return status has not yet been
retrieved.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The aio_return() function is part of
the Asynchronous Input and Output option and need not be
available on all implementations.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
