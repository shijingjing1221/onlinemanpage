<p>NAME xwud - image displayer for X</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS xwud [-in file] [-noclick] [-geometry geom]
[-display display] [-new] [-std &lt;maptype&gt;] [-raw]
[-vis &lt;vis-type-or-id&gt;] [-scale] [-help] [-rv] [-plane
number] [-fg color] [-bg color] [-dumpheader]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Xwud is an X Window System image undumping
utility. Xwud allows X users to display in a window an image
saved in a specially formatted dump file, such as produced
by xwd(1).</p>

<p>OPTIONS -bg color If a bitmap image (or a single plane
of an image) is displayed, this option can be used to
specify the color to display for the &quot;0&quot; bits in
the image.</p>

<p>-display display This option allows you to specify the
server to connect to; see X(7).</p>

<p>-dumpheader This option prints out the XWD header
information only. Noth- ing is displayed.</p>

<p>-fg color If a bitmap image (or a single plane of an
image) is displayed, this option can be used to specify the
color to display for the &quot;1&quot; bits in the
image.</p>

<p>-geometry geom This option allows you to specify the
size and position of the window. Typically you will only
want to specify the position, and let the size default to
the actual size of the image.</p>

<p>-help Print out a short description of the allowable
options.</p>

<p>-in file This option allows the user to explicitly
specify the input file on the command line. If no input file
is given, the stan- dard input is assumed.</p>

<p>-new This option forces creation of a new colormap for
displaying the image. If the image characteristics happen to
match those of the display, this can get the image on the
screen faster, but at the cost of using a new colormap
(which on most displays will cause other windows to go
technicolor).</p>

<p>-noclick Clicking any button in the window will
terminate the applica- tion, unless this option is
specified. Termination can always be achieved by typing q,
Q, or ctrl-c.</p>

<p>-plane number You can select a single bit plane of the
image to display with this option. Planes are numbered with
zero being the least significant bit.</p>

<p>-raw This option forces the image to be displayed with
whatever color values happen to currently exist on the
screen. This option is mostly useful when undumping an image
back onto the same screen that the image originally came
from, while the original windows are still on the screen,
and results in get- ting the image on the screen faster.</p>

<p>-rv If a bitmap image (or a single plane of an image) is
displayed, this option forces the foreground and background
colors to be swapped. This may be needed when displaying a
bitmap image which has the color sense of pixel values
&quot;0&quot; and &quot;1&quot; reversed from what they are
on your display.</p>

<p>-scale Allow the window to be resized, and scale the
image to the size of the window.</p>

<p>-std maptype This option causes the image to be
displayed using the speci- fied Standard Colormap. The
property name is obtained by con- verting the type to upper
case, prepending &quot;RGB_&quot;, and append- ing
&quot;_MAP&quot;. Typical types are &quot;best&quot;,
&quot;default&quot;, and &quot;gray&quot;. See xstdcmap(1)
for one way of creating Standard Colormaps.</p>

<p>-vis vis-type-or-id This option allows you to specify a
particular visual or visual class. The default is to pick
the &quot;best&quot; one. A particular class can be
specified: &quot;StaticGray&quot;, &quot;GrayScale&quot;,
&quot;Static- Color&quot;, &quot;PseudoColor&quot;,
&quot;DirectColor&quot;, or &quot;TrueColor&quot;. Or
&quot;Match&quot; can be specified, meaning use the same
class as the source image. Alternatively, an exact visual id
(specific to the server) can be specified, either as a
hexadecimal number (prefixed with &quot;0x&quot;) or as a
decimal number. Finally, &quot;default&quot; can be
specified, meaning to use the same class as the colormap of
the root window. Case is not significant in any of these
strings.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT DISPLAY To get default display.</p>

<p>FILES XWDFile.h X Window Dump File format definition
file.</p>

<p>BUGS xwud doesn t handle big/deep images very well on
servers that dont have the BIG-REQUESTS extension.</p>
