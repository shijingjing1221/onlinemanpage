<p>NAME XCirculateEvent - CirculateNotify event
structure</p>

<p>STRUCTURES The structure for CirculateNotify events
contains:</p>

<p>typedef struct { int type; /* CirculateNotify */
unsigned long serial; /* # of last request processed by
server */ Bool send_event; /* true if this came from a
SendEvent request */ Display *display; /* Display the event
was read from */ Window event; Window window; int place; /*
PlaceOnTop, PlaceOnBottom */ } XCirculateEvent;</p>

<p>When you receive this event, the structure members are
set as follows.</p>

<p>The type member is set to the event type constant name
that uniquely identifies it. For example, when the X server
reports a GraphicsExpose event to a client application, it
sends an XGraphicsExposeEvent struc- ture with the type
member set to GraphicsExpose. The display member is set to a
pointer to the display the event was read on. The send_event
member is set to True if the event came from a SendEvent
protocol request. The serial member is set from the serial
number reported in the protocol but expanded from the 16-bit
least-significant bits to a full 32-bit value. The window
member is set to the window that is most useful to toolkit
dispatchers.</p>

<p>The event member is set either to the restacked window
or to its par- ent, depending on whether StructureNotify or
SubstructureNotify was selected. The window member is set to
the window that was restacked. The place member is set to
the windows position after the restack occurs and is either
PlaceOnTop or PlaceOnBottom. If it is PlaceOnTop, the window
is now on top of all siblings. If it is PlaceOnBottom, the
window is now below all siblings.</p>
