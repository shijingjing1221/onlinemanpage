<p>sane-ibm(5) SANE Scanner Access Now Easy sane-ibm(5)</p>

<p>NAME sane-ibm - SANE backend for IBM and Ricoh SCSI
flatbed scanners</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sane-ibm library implements a SANE
(Scanner Access Now Easy) back- end that provides access to
the IBM 2456 and the Ricoh IS-410, IS-420, and IS-430
flatbed scanners. Support for the IS-410 and IS-430 is
untested. Please contact the maintainer or the sane-devel
mailing list if you own such a scanner.</p>

<p>This backend is alpha-quality. It may have bugs and some
scanners havent been tested at all. Be careful and pull the
plug if the scanner causes unusual noise.</p>

<p>DEVICE NAMES This backend expects device names of the
form:</p>

<p>special</p>

<p>Where special is either the path-name for the special
device that cor- responds to a SCSI scanner. The program
sane-find-scanner helps to find out the correct device.
Under Linux, such a device name could be /dev/sg0 or
/dev/sga, for example. See sane-scsi(5) for details.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION The contents of the ibm.conf file is a
list of device names that corre- spond to SCSI scanners.
Empty lines and lines starting with a hash mark (#) are
ignored. See sane-scsi(5) on details of what constitutes a
valid device name.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/sane.d/ibm.conf The backend configuration
file (see also description of SANE_CONFIG_DIR below).</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-ibm.a The static library
implementing this backend.</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-ibm.so The shared library
implementing this backend (present on systems that support
dynamic loading).</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT SANE_CONFIG_DIR This environment variable
specifies the list of directories that may contain the
configuration file. Under UNIX, the directories are
separated by a colon (:), under OS/2, they are separated by
a semi-colon (;). If this variable is not set, the config-
uration file is searched in two default directories: first,
the current working directory (&quot;.&quot;) and then in
/etc/sane.d. If the value of the environment variable ends
with the directory sepa- rator character, then the default
directories are searched after the explicitly specified
directories. For example, setting SANE_CONFIG_DIR to
&quot;/tmp/config:&quot; would result in directories
&quot;tmp/config&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and
&quot;/etc/sane.d&quot; being searched (in this order).</p>

<p>SANE_DEBUG_IBM If the library was compiled with debug
support enabled, this environment variable controls the
debug level for this backend. Higher debug levels increase
the verbosity of the output.</p>
