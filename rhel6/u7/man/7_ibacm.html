<p>NAME ibacm - InfiniBand communication management
assistant</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;infiniband/ib_acm.h&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Used to resolve remote endpoint information
before establishing commu- nications over InfiniBand.</p>

<p>NOTES Th IB ACM provides scalable address and route
resolution services over InfiniBand. It resolves system
network names and IP addresses to InfiniBand path record
data using efficient mechanisms, including caching of
data.</p>

<p>The IB ACM provides information needed to establish a
connection, but does not implement the communication
management protocol. It provides services similar to
rdma_getaddrinfo, rdma_resolve_addr, and rdma_resolve_route
using IB multicast. The IB ACM does not require IPoIB or use
standard naming services, such as DNS, and limits network
communication, especially with the IB SA. The ib_acme
utility assists in verifying what options of the ibacm
service may be usable for the current fabric topology.</p>

<p>Client interactions with the ibacm service are done over
sockets through a standard TCP connection. The librdmacm
abstracts this inter- action.</p>

<p>RETURN CODES == 0 success</p>

<p>!= 0 error</p>
