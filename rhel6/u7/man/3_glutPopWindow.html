<p>NAME glutPopWindow - Request to raise the current window
to the top</p>

<p>LIBRARY OpenGLUT - window</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;openglut.h&gt;</p>

<p>void glutPopWindow(void);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Request that the current window be brought
to the top.</p>

<p>A window can be in front of or behind other windows, as
determined by the z-order from front to back. Top-level
OpenGLUT windows can be placed at the front or back of the
z-order by means of the glutPopWindow() and glutPushWindow()
API functions.</p>

<p>A z-order also applies to the subwindows of a top-level
window. While the z-order of top-level windows can usually
be adjusted by the user, subwindow z-order is controlled
entirely by the application.</p>

<p>If this has any effect on your windows visibility, you
should receive a glutWindowStatusFunc() callback and a
glutDisplayFunc() callback.</p>

<p>CAVEATS The z-order of top-level windows is ultimately
managed by the windowing system. Therefore, a push or pop
request by an OpenGLUT application may not necessarily
succeed or take immediate effect.</p>

<p>Not applicable to offscreen windows.</p>
