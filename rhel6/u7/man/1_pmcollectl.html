<p>NAME pmcollectl - collect data that describes the
current system status</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pmcollectl [-f file | -p file ...] [options
...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pmcollectl is a system-level performance
monitoring utility that records or displays specific
operating system data for one or more sets of subsystems.
Any of the subsystems (such as CPU, Disks, Memory or
Sockets) can be included or excluded from data collection.
Data can either be displayed immediately to a terminal, or
stored in files for retrospective analysis.</p>

<p>pmcollectl is a python(1) script providing much of the
functionality available from the collectl(1) Linux utility
(which happens to be writ- ten in perl(1)).</p>

<p>It makes use of the Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) toolkit
to simplify its implementation, as well as provide more of
the collectl functionality on platforms other than
Linux.</p>

<p>pmcollectl has two primary modes of operation:</p>

<p>1. Record Mode (-f or --filename option) which reads
data from a live system and writes output to a file or
displays it on a terminal.</p>

<p>2. Playback Mode (-p or --playback option) which reads
data from one or more PCP archive files and displays output
on a terminal. Note that these files are not raw collectl
format data, rather they are archives created by the
pmlogger(1) utility (possibly indirectly, through use of the
-f option to pmcollectl).</p>

<p>RECORD MODE OPTIONS In this mode data is taken from a
live system and either displayed on the terminal or written
to a PCP archive.</p>

<p>-h host Display metrics from host instead of displaying
metrics from the local host.</p>

<p>-c, --count samples The number of samples to record.</p>

<p>-f, --filename filename This is the name of a PCP
archive to write the output to.</p>

<p>-i, --interval interval This is the sampling interval in
seconds. The default is 1 sec- ond. -R, --runtime duration
Specify the duration of data collection where the duration
is a number followed by one of wdhms, indicating how many
weeks, days, hours, minutes or seconds the collection is to
be taken for.</p>

<p>PLAYBACK MODE OPTIONS In this mode, data is read from
one or more PCP data files that were generated with the
recording option, or indirectly via the pmlogger
utility.</p>

<p>-f, --filename filename If specified, this is the name
of a PCP archive to write the output to (rather than the
terminal).</p>

<p>-p, --playback filename Read data from the specified PCP
archive files(s).</p>

<p>COMMON OPTIONS The following options are supported in
both record and playback modes.</p>

<p>--help Display standard help message.</p>

<p>-s, --subsys subsystem This field controls which
subsystem data is to be collected or played back for. The
rules for displaying results vary depending on the type of
data to be displayed. If you write data for CPUs and DISKs
to a raw file and play it back with -sc, you will only see
CPU data. If you play it back with -scm you will still only
see CPU data since memory data was not collected. To see the
current set of default subsystems, which are a subset of
this full list, use -h.</p>

<p>The default is &quot;cdn&quot;, which stands for CPU,
Disk and Network summary data.</p>

<p>SUMMARY SUBSYSTEMS</p>

<p>c - CPU d - Disk f - NFS V3 Data j - Interrupts m -
Memory n - Networks y - Slabs (system object caches)</p>

<p>DETAIL SUBSYSTEMS</p>

<p>This is the set of detail data from which in most cases
the cor- responding summary data is derived. So, if one has
3 disks and chooses -sd, one will only see a single total
taken across all 3 disks. If one chooses -sD, individual
disk totals will be reported but no totals.</p>

<p>C - CPU D - Disk F - NFS Data J - Interrupts M - Memory
node data, which is also known as NUMA data N - Networks Y -
Slabs (system object caches) Z - Processes</p>

<p>--verbose Display output in verbose mode. This often
displays more data than in the default mode. When displaying
detail data, verbose mode is forced. Furthermore, if summary
data for a single sub- system is to be displayed in verbose
mode, the headers are only repeated occasionally whereas if
multiple subsystems are involved each needs their own
header.</p>
