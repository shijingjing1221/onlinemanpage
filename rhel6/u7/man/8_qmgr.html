<p>NAME qmgr - Postfix queue manager</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS qmgr [generic Postfix daemon options]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The qmgr(8) daemon awaits the arrival of
incoming mail and arranges for its delivery via Postfix
delivery processes. The actual mail routing strategy is
delegated to the trivial-rewrite(8) daemon. This program
expects to be run from the master(8) process manager.</p>

<p>Mail addressed to the local double-bounce address is
logged and dis- carded. This stops potential loops caused by
undeliverable bounce notifications.</p>

<p>MAIL QUEUES The qmgr(8) daemon maintains the following
queues:</p>

<p>incoming Inbound mail from the network, or mail picked
up by the local pickup(8) daemon from the maildrop
directory.</p>

<p>active Messages that the queue manager has opened for
delivery. Only a limited number of messages is allowed to
enter the active queue (leaky bucket strategy, for a fixed
delivery rate).</p>

<p>deferred Mail that could not be delivered upon the first
attempt. The queue manager implements exponential backoff by
doubling the time between delivery attempts.</p>

<p>corrupt Unreadable or damaged queue files are moved here
for inspection.</p>

<p>hold Messages that are kept &quot;on hold&quot; are kept
here until someone sets them free.</p>

<p>DELIVERY STATUS REPORTS The qmgr(8) daemon keeps an eye
on per-message delivery status reports in the following
directories. Each status report file has the same name as
the corresponding message file:</p>

<p>bounce Per-recipient status information about why mail
is bounced. These files are maintained by the bounce(8)
daemon.</p>

<p>defer Per-recipient status information about why mail is
delayed. These files are maintained by the defer(8)
daemon.</p>

<p>trace Per-recipient status information as requested with
the Postfix &quot;sendmail -v&quot; or &quot;sendmail
-bv&quot; command. These files are main- tained by the
trace(8) daemon.</p>

<p>The qmgr(8) daemon is responsible for asking the
bounce(8), defer(8) or trace(8) daemons to send delivery
reports.</p>

<p>STRATEGIES The queue manager implements a variety of
strategies for either opening queue files (input) or for
message delivery (output).</p>

<p>leaky bucket This strategy limits the number of messages
in the active queue and prevents the queue manager from
running out of memory under heavy load.</p>

<p>fairness When the active queue has room, the queue
manager takes one mes- sage from the incoming queue and one
from the deferred queue. This prevents a large mail backlog
from blocking the delivery of new mail.</p>

<p>slow start This strategy eliminates &quot;thundering
herd&quot; problems by slowly adjusting the number of
parallel deliveries to the same destina- tion.</p>

<p>round robin The queue manager sorts delivery requests by
destination. Round-robin selection prevents one destination
from dominating deliveries to other destinations.</p>

<p>exponential backoff Mail that cannot be delivered upon
the first attempt is deferred. The time interval between
delivery attempts is dou- bled after each attempt.</p>

<p>destination status cache The queue manager avoids
unnecessary delivery attempts by main- taining a short-term,
in-memory list of unreachable destina- tions.</p>

<p>preemptive message scheduling The queue manager attempts
to minimize the average per-recipient delay while still
preserving the correct per-message delays, using a
sophisticated preemptive message scheduling.</p>

<p>TRIGGERS On an idle system, the queue manager waits for
the arrival of trigger events, or it waits for a timer to go
off. A trigger is a one-byte mes- sage. Depending on the
message received, the queue manager performs one of the
following actions (the message is followed by the symbolic
constant used internally by the software):</p>

<p>D (QMGR_REQ_SCAN_DEFERRED) Start a deferred queue scan.
If a deferred queue scan is already in progress, that scan
will be restarted as soon as it finishes.</p>

<p>I (QMGR_REQ_SCAN_INCOMING) Start an incoming queue scan.
If an incoming queue scan is already in progress, that scan
will be restarted as soon as it finishes.</p>

<p>A (QMGR_REQ_SCAN_ALL) Ignore deferred queue file time
stamps. The request affects the next deferred queue
scan.</p>

<p>F (QMGR_REQ_FLUSH_DEAD) Purge all information about dead
transports and destinations.</p>

<p>W (TRIGGER_REQ_WAKEUP) Wakeup call, This is used by the
master server to instantiate servers that should not go away
forever. The action is to start an incoming queue scan.</p>

<p>The qmgr(8) daemon reads an entire buffer worth of
triggers. Multiple identical trigger requests are collapsed
into one, and trigger requests are sorted so that A and F
precede D and I. Thus, in order to force a deferred queue
run, one would request A F D; in order to notify the queue
manager of the arrival of new mail one would request I.</p>

<p>STANDARDS RFC 3463 (Enhanced status codes) RFC 3464
(Delivery status notifications)</p>

<p>SECURITY The qmgr(8) daemon is not security sensitive.
It reads single-character messages from untrusted local
users, and thus may be susceptible to denial of service
attacks. The qmgr(8) daemon does not talk to the out- side
world, and it can be run at fixed low privilege in a
chrooted environment.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS Problems and transactions are logged to the
syslog daemon. Corrupted message files are saved to the
corrupt queue for further inspection.</p>

<p>Depending on the setting of the notify_classes
parameter, the postmas- ter is notified of bounces and of
other trouble.</p>

<p>BUGS A single queue manager process has to compete for
disk access with mul- tiple front-end processes such as
cleanup(8). A sudden burst of inbound mail can negatively
impact outbound delivery rates.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS Changes to main.cf are not
picked up automatically as qmgr(8) is a per- sistent
process. Use the &quot;postfix reload&quot; command after a
configuration change.</p>

postconf(5) for more details including examples.</p>
