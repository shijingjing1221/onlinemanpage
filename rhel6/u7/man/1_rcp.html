<p>RCP(1) BSD General Commands Manual RCP(1)</p>

<p>NAME rcp - remote file copy</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rcp [-px] file1 file2 rcp [-px] [-r] file ...
directory</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Rcp copies files between machines. Each file
or directory argument is either a remote file name of the
form rname@rhost:path, or a local file name (containing no :
characters, or a / before any : s).</p>

<p>-r If any of the source files are directories, rcp
copies each subtree rooted at that name; in this case the
destination must be a direc- tory.</p>

<p>-p The -p option causes rcp to attempt to preserve
(duplicate) in its copies the modification times and modes
of the source files, ignor- ing the umask. By default, the
mode and owner of file2 are pre- served if it already
existed; otherwise the mode of the source file modified by
the umask(2) on the destination host is used.</p>

<p>If path is not a full path name, it is interpreted
relative to the login directory of the specified user ruser
on rhost, or your current user name if no other remote user
name is specified. A path on a remote host may be quoted
(using &quot;, or &acute;) so that the metacharacters are
interpreted remotely.</p>

<p>Rcp does not prompt for passwords; it performs remote
execution via rsh(1), and requires the same
authorization.</p>

<p>Rcp handles third party copies, where neither source nor
target files are on the current machine.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO cp(1), ftp(1), rsh(1), rlogin(1)</p>

<p>HISTORY The rcp command appeared in 4.2BSD.</p>

<p>BUGS Doesnt detect all cases where the target of a copy
might be a file in cases where only a directory should be
legal.</p>

<p>Is confused by any output generated by commands in a
.login, .profile, or .cshrc file on the remote host.</p>

<p>The destination user and hostname may have to be
specified as rhost.rname when the destination machine is
running the 4.2BSD ver- sion of rcp.</p>
