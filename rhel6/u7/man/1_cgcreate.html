<p>NAME cgcreate - create new cgroup(s)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS cgcreate [-h] [-t &lt;tuid&gt;:&lt;tgid&gt;]
[-a &lt;agid&gt;:&lt;auid&gt;] [-f mode] [-d mode] [-s mode]
-g &lt;controllers&gt;:&lt;path&gt; [-g ...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The command creates new cgroup(s) defined by
the options -g.</p>

<p>-a &lt;agid&gt;:&lt;auid&gt; defines the name of the
user and the group which own the rest of the defined control
groups files. These users are allowed to set subsystem
parameters and create subgroups. The default value is the
same as has the parent cgroup.</p>

<p>-d, --dperm=mode sets the permissions of a control
groups directory. The permis- sions needs to be specified as
octal numbers e.g. -d 775.</p>

<p>-f, --fperm=mode sets the permissions of the control
groups parameters. The per- missions needs to be specified
as octal numbers e.g. -f 775. The value is not used as given
because the current owners per- missions are used as an
umask (so 777 will set group and others permissions to the
owners permissions).</p>

<p>-g &lt;controllers&gt;:&lt;path&gt; defines control
groups to be added. controllers is a list of controllers and
path is the relative path to control groups in the given
controllers list. This option can be specified multi- ple
times.</p>

<p>-h, --help display this help and exit</p>

<p>-s, --tperm=mode sets the permissions of the control
group tasks file. The per- missions needs to be specified as
octal numbers e.g. -s 775. The value is not used as given
because the current owners per- missions are used as an
umask (so 777 will set group and others permissions to the
owners permissions).</p>

<p>-t &lt;tuid&gt;:&lt;tgid&gt; defines the name of the
user and the group, which owns tasks file of the defined
control group. I.e. this user and members of this group have
write access to the file. The default value is the same as
has the parent cgroup.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES CGROUP_LOGLEVEL controls verbosity
of the tool. Allowed values are DEBUG, INFO, WARNING or
ERROR.</p>
