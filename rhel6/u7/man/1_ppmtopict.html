<p>NAME ppmtopict - convert a PPM image to a Macintosh PICT
file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ppmtopict</p>

<p>[ppmfile]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>ppmtopict reads a PPM image as input and produces a
Macintosh PICT file as output.</p>

<p>The generated file is only the data fork of a picture.
You will need a program such as mcvert to generate a
Macbinary or a BinHex file that contains the necessary
information to identify the file as a PICT file to
MacOS.</p>

<p>Even though PICT can have 2 and 4 bits per pixel,
ppmtopict always gen- erates an 8 bits per pixel file.</p>

<p>LIMITATIONS The picture size field is correct only if
the output is to a file since writing into this field
requires seeking backwards on a file. However the PICT
documentation seems to suggest that this field is not
critical anyway since it is only the lower 16 bits of the
picture size.</p>
