<p>SNMPCONF(1) Net-SNMP SNMPCONF(1)</p>

<p>NAME snmpconf - creates and modifies SNMP configuration
files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS snmpconf [OPTIONS] [fileToCreate]</p>

<p>Start with: snmpconf -g basic_setup</p>

<p>Or even just: snmpconf</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION snmpconf is a simple Perl script that walks
you through setting up a configuration file step by step. It
should be fairly straight forward to use. Merely run it and
answer its questions.</p>

<p>In its default mode of operation, it prompts the user
with menus show- ing sections of the various configuration
files it knows about. When the user selects a section, a
sub-menu is shown listing of the descrip- tions of the
tokens that can be created in that section. When a
description is selected, the user is prompted with questions
that con- struct the configuration line in question.</p>

<p>Finally, when the user quits the program any
configuration files that have been edited by the user are
saved to the local directory, fully commented.</p>

<p>A particularly useful option is the -g switch, which
walks a user through a specific set of configuration
questions. Run:</p>

<p>snmpconf -g basic_setup</p>

<p>for an example.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -f Force overwriting existing files in the
current directory with- out prompting the user if this is a
desired thing to do.</p>

<p>-i When finished, install the files into the location
where the global system commands expect to find them.</p>

<p>-p When finished, install the files into the users home
direc- torys .snmp subdirectory (where the applications will
also search for configuration files).</p>

<p>-I DIRECTORY When finished, install the files into the
directory DIRECTORY.</p>

<p>-a Dont ask any questions. Simply read in the various
known con- figuration files and write them back out again.
This has the effect of &quot;auto-commenting&quot; the
configuration files for you. See the NEAT TRICKS section
below.</p>

<p>-rall|none Read in either all or none of the found
configuration files. Normally snmpconf prompts you for which
files you wish to read in. Reading in these configuration
files will merge these files with the results of the
questions that it asks of you.</p>

<p>-R FILE,... Read in a specific list of configuration
files.</p>

<p>-g GROUPNAME Groups of configuration entries can be
created that can be used to walk a user through a series of
questions to create an ini- tial configuration file. There
are no menus to navigate, just a list of questions. Run:</p>

<p>snmpconf -g basic_setup</p>

<p>for a good example.</p>

<p>-G List all the known groups.</p>

<p>-c CONFIGDIR snmpconf uses a directory of configuration
information to learn about the files and questions that it
should be asking. This option tells snmpconf to use a
different location for configur- ing itself.</p>

<p>-q Run slightly more quietly. Since this is an
interactive pro- gram, I dont recommend this option since it
only removes information from the output that is designed to
help you.</p>

<p>-d Turn on lots of debugging output.</p>

<p>-D Add even more debugging output in the form of Perl
variable dumps.</p>

<p>NEAT TRICKS snmpconf -g basic_setup Have I mentioned
this command enough yet? Its designed to walk someone
through an initial setup for the snmpd(8) daemon. Really,
you should try it.</p>

<p>snmpconf -R /usr/local/snmp/snmpd.conf -a -f snmpd.conf
Automatically reads in an snmpd.conf file (for example) and
adds comments to them describing what each token does. Try
it. Its cool.</p>

<p>NOTES snmpconf is actually a very generic utility that
could be easily con- figured to help construct just about
any kind of configuration file. Its default configuration
set of files are SNMP based.</p>
