<p>XF86MISC(3) X FUNCTIONS XF86MISC(3)</p>

<p>NAME XF86MiscQueryExtension, XF86MiscQueryVersion,
XF86MiscGetMouseSettings, XF86MiscSetMouseSettings,
XF86MiscGetKbdSettings, XF86MiscSetKbdSet- tings - Extension
library for the XFree86-Misc X extension.</p>

<p>SYNTAX #include &lt;X11/extensions/xf86misc.h&gt;</p>

<p>Bool XF86MiscQueryExtension( Display *display, int
*event_base_return, int *error_base_return);</p>

<p>Bool XF86MiscQueryVersion( Display *display, int
*major_version_return, int *minor_version_return);</p>

<p>Status XF86MiscGetMouseSettings( Display *display,

<p>Status XF86MiscSetKbdSettings( Display *display,
XF86MiscKbdSettings *kbdinfo);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS display Specifies the connection to the X
server.</p>

<p>screen Specifies which screen number the setting apply
to.</p>

<p>event_base_return Returns the base event number for the
extension.</p>

<p>error_base_return Returns the base error number for the
extension.</p>

<p>major_version_return Returns the major version number of
the extension.</p>

<p>minor_version_return Returns the minor version number of
the extension.</p>

<p>mseinfo Specifies a structure which contains the mouse
parameters.</p>

<p>kbdinfo Specifies a structure which contains the
keyboard parameters.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION These functions provide an interface to the
XFree86-Misc extension which allows various server settings
to be queried and changed dynami- cally. Applications that
use these functions must be linked with -lXxf86misc</p>

<p>POWER-SAVER FUNCTIONS The XF86MiscGetSaver and
XF86MiscSetSaver functions have been removed. This
functionality is now provided by the DPMS extension.</p>

<p>MOUSE FUNCTIONS Mouse parameters can be queried using
the function XF86MiscGetMouseSet- tings. The structure
pointed to by its second argument is filled in with the
current mouse settings.</p>

<p>Not all fields are valid in all cases. For example, when
the protocol indicates a bus mouse (i.e. the type field has
value MTYPE_BUSMOUSE as defined in xf86misc.h), then the
value in the baudrate field should be ignored as it does not
apply to bus mice.</p>

<p>The samplerate field contains the resolution in lines
per inch when using the Hitachi tablet protocol.</p>

<p>The device field of the structure points to dynamically
allocated stor- age which should be freed by the caller.</p>

<p>Any of the fields of the structure can be altered and
then passed to the XF86MiscSetMouseSettings function to
change their value in the server, with the following
restrictions:</p>

<p>1) The device can not be changed</p>

<p>2) The protocol can not be changed to or from Xqueue or
OsMouse</p>

<p>3) The buttons field can not be changed</p>

<p>4) Invalid combinations of parameters are not
allowed</p>

<p>The server will generate an error if any of the above is
attempted, except the first - the contents of the device
field are simply ignored.</p>

<p>A change of the protocol causes the device to be closed
and reopened. Changes to the baud rate, sample rate,
resolution or flags, when appli- cable to the selected
protocol, also cause a reopen of the device. A reopen can be
forced by using the MF_REOPEN flag, except in the case of
the OsMouse and Xqueue protocols which ignore all attempts
to reopen the device.</p>

<p>KEYBOARD FUNCTIONS The XF86MiscGetKbdSettings function
allows you to retrieve the current keyboard-related settings
from the server.</p>

<p>Using the XF86MiscSetKbdSettings function, the keyboard
autorepeat delay and rate can be set. Requests to change the
type and servnumlock fields are ignored (except for checking
for an invalid keyboard type). This is expected to change in
a future release.</p>

<p>OTHER FUNCTIONS Two functions, XF86MiscQueryExtension
and XF86MiscQueryVersion, are provided which allow the
client to query some information regarding the extension
itself.</p>

<p>PREDEFINED VALUES The header file
X11/extensions/xf86misc.h contains definitions for</p>

<p>MTYPE_* Mouse protocols</p>

<p>KTYPE_* Keyboard types</p>

<p>MF_* Mouse flags</p>
