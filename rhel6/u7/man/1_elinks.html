<p>ELINKS(1) The Elinks text-browser ELINKS(1)</p>

<p>NAME elinks - lynx-like alternative character mode WWW
browser</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS elinks [OPTION]... [URL]...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION ELinks is a text mode WWW browser,
supporting colors, table rendering, background downloading,
menu driven configuration interface, tabbed browsing and
slim code.</p>

<p>Frames are supported. You can have different file
formats associated with external viewers. mailto: and
telnet: are supported via external clients.</p>

<p>ELinks can handle both local files and remote URLs. The
main supported remote URL protocols are HTTP, HTTPS (with
SSL support compiled in) and FTP. Additional protocol
support exists for BitTorrent finger, Gopher, SMB and
NNTP.</p>

<p>The homepage of ELinks can be found at
&lt;http://elinks.cz/&gt;, where the ELinks manual is also
hosted.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Most options can be set in the user interface or
config file, so usually you do not need to care about them.
Note that this list is roughly equivalent to the output of
running ELinks with the option --long-help.</p>

<p>-anonymous [0|1] (default: 0) Restricts ELinks so it can
run on an anonymous account. Local file browsing, downloads,
and modification of options will be disabled. Execution of
viewers is allowed, but entries in the association table
can&acute;t be added or modified.</p>

<p>-auto-submit [0|1] (default: 0) Automatically submit the
first form in the given URLs.</p>

<p>-base-session &lt;num&gt; (default: 0) Used internally
when opening ELinks instances in new windows. The ID maps to
information that will be used when creating the new
instance. You don&acute;t want to use it.</p>

<p>-config-dir &lt;str&gt; (default: &quot;&quot;) Path of
the directory ELinks will read and write its config and
runtime state files to instead of ~/.elinks. If the path
does not begin with a &acute;/&acute; it is assumed to be
relative to your HOME directory.</p>

<p>-config-dump Print a configuration file with options set
to the built-in defaults to stdout.</p>

<p>-config-file &lt;str&gt; (default:
&quot;elinks.conf&quot;) Name of the configuration file that
all configuration options will be read from and written to.
It should be relative to config-dir.</p>

<p>-config-help Print help for configuration options and
exit.</p>

<p>-default-mime-type (alias for mime.default_type) The
default MIME type used for documents of unknown type.</p>

<p>-default-keys [0|1] (default: 0) When set, all
keybindings from configuration files will be ignored. It
forces use of default keybindings and will reset
user-defined ones on save.</p>

<p>-dump [0|1] (default: 0) Print formatted plain-text
versions of given URLs to stdout.</p>

<p>-dump-charset (alias for document.dump.codepage)
Codepage used when formatting dump output.</p>

<p>-dump-color-mode (alias for document.dump.color_mode)
Color mode used with -dump.</p>

<p>-dump-width (alias for document.dump.width) Width of the
dump output.</p>

<p>-eval Specify configuration file directives on the
command-line which will be evaluated after all configuration
files has been read. Example usage: -eval &acute;set
protocol.file.allow_special_files = 1&acute;</p>

<p>-force-html Makes ELinks assume documents of unknown
types are HTML. Useful when using ELinks as an external
viewer from MUAs. This is equivalent to -default-mime-type
text/html.</p>

<p>-?, -h, -help Print usage help and exit.</p>

<p>-localhost [0|1] (default: 0) Restricts ELinks to work
offline and only connect to servers with local addresses
(ie. 127.0.0.1). No connections to remote servers will be
permitted.</p>

<p>-long-help Print detailed usage help and exit.</p>

<p>-lookup Look up specified host and print all DNS
resolved IP addresses.</p>

<p>-no-connect [0|1] (default: 0) Run ELinks as a separate
instance instead of connecting to an existing instance. Note
that normally no runtime state files (bookmarks, history,
etc.) are written to the disk when this option is used. See
also -touch-files.</p>

<p>-no-home [0|1] (default: 0) Disables creation and use of
files in the user specific home configuration directory
(~/.elinks). It forces default configuration values to be
used and disables saving of runtime state files.</p>

<p>-no-numbering (alias for document.dump.numbering)
Prevents printing of link number in dump output.</p>

<p>Note that this really affects only -dump, nothing
else.</p>

<p>-no-references (alias for document.dump.references)
Prevents printing of references (URIs) of document links in
dump output.</p>

<p>Note that this really affects only -dump, nothing
else.</p>

<p>-remote Control a remote ELinks instance by passing
commands to it. The option takes an additional argument
containing the method which should be invoked and any
parameters that should be passed to it. For ease of use, the
additional method argument can be omitted in which case any
URL arguments will be opened in new tabs in the remote
instance.</p>

<p>Following is a list of the supported methods:</p>

<p>&middot; ping(): look for a remote instance</p>

<p>&middot; openURL(): prompt URL in current tab</p>

<p>&middot; openURL(URL): open URL in current tab</p>

<p>&middot; openURL(URL, new-tab): open URL in new tab</p>

<p>&middot; openURL(URL, new-window): open URL in new
window</p>

<p>&middot; addBookmark(URL): bookmark URL</p>

<p>&middot; infoBox(text): show text in a message box</p>

<p>&middot; xfeDoCommand(openBrowser): open new window</p>

<p>-session-ring &lt;num&gt; (default: 0) ID of session
ring this ELinks session should connect to. ELinks works in
so-called session rings, whereby all instances of ELinks are
interconnected and share state (cache, bookmarks, cookies,
and so on). By default, all ELinks instances connect to
session ring 0. You can change that behaviour with this
switch and form as many session rings as you want.
Obviously, if the session-ring with this number
doesn&acute;t exist yet, it&acute;s created and this ELinks
instance will become the master instance (that usually
doesn&acute;t matter for you as a user much).</p>

<p>Note that you usually don&acute;t want to use this
unless you&acute;re a developer and you want to do some
testing - if you want the ELinks instances each running
standalone, rather use the -no-connect command-line option.
Also note that normally no runtime state files are written
to the disk when this option is used. See also
-touch-files.</p>

<p>-source [0|1] (default: 0) Print given URLs in source
form to stdout.</p>

<p>-touch-files [0|1] (default: 0) When enabled, runtime
state files (bookmarks, history, etc.) are written to disk,
even when -no-connect or -session-ring is used. The option
has no effect if not used in conjunction with any of these
options.</p>

<p>-verbose &lt;num&gt; (default: 1) The verbose level
controls what messages are shown at start up and while
running:</p>

<p>&middot; 0 means only show serious errors</p>

<p>&middot; 1 means show serious errors and warnings</p>

<p>&middot; 2 means show all messages</p>

<p>-version Print ELinks version information and exit.
