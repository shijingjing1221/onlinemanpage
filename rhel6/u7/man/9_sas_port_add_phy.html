<p>SAS_PORT_ADD_PHY(9) SCSI mid layer
SAS_PORT_ADD_PHY(9)</p>

<p>NAME sas_port_add_phy - add another phy to a port to
form a wide port</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS void sas_port_add_phy(struct sas_port * port,
struct sas_phy * phy);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS port port to add the phy to</p>

<p>phy phy to add</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION When a port is initially created, it is
empty (has no phys). All ports must have at least one phy to
operated, and all wide ports must have at least two. The
current code makes no difference between ports and wide
ports, but the only object that can be connected to a remote
device is a port, so ports must be formed on all devices
with phys if they&acute;re connected to anything.</p>
