<p>NAME ppmtosixel - convert a PPM image to DEC sixel
format</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ppmtosixel</p>

<p>[-raw]</p>

<p>[-margin]</p>

<p>[ppmfile]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>ppmtosixel reads a PPM image as input and produces sixel
commands (SIX) as output. The output is formatted for color
printing, e.g. for a DEC LJ250 color inkjet printer.</p>

<p>If RGB values from the PPM file do not have maxval=100,
ppmtosixel rescales them to maxval 100. A printer control
header and a color assignment table begin the SIX file.
Image data is in a compressed format by default. A printer
control footer ends the image file.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -raw If you specify this, each pixel will be
explicitly described in the image file. If -raw is not
specified, output will default to compressed format in which
identical adjacent pixels are replaced by repeat pixel
commands. A raw file is often an order of magnitude larger
than a compressed file and prints much slower.</p>

<p>-margin If you dont specify -margin, the image will
start at the left margin (of the window, paper, or
whatever). If you do specify -margin, a 1.5 inch left margin
will offset the image.</p>

<p>PRINTING Generally, sixel files must reach the printer
unfiltered. Use the lpr -x option or cat filename &gt;
/dev/tty0?.</p>

<p>LIMITATIONS Upon rescaling, truncation of the least
significant bits of RGB values may result in poor color
conversion. If the original PPM maxval was greater than 100,
rescaling also reduces the image depth. While the actual RGB
values from the ppm file are more or less retained, the
color palette of the LJ250 may not match the colors on your
screen. This seems to be a printer limitation.</p>
