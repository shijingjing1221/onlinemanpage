<p>PTHREAD_SPIN_LOCK(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
PTHREAD_SPIN_LOCK(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME pthread_spin_lock, pthread_spin_trylock - lock a
spin lock object (ADVANCED REALTIME THREADS)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;</p>

<p>int pthread_spin_lock(pthread_spinlock_t *lock); int
pthread_spin_trylock(pthread_spinlock_t *lock);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pthread_spin_lock() function shall lock
the spin lock referenced by lock. The calling thread shall
acquire the lock if it is not held by another thread.
Otherwise, the thread shall spin (that is, shall not return
from the pthread_spin_lock() call) until the lock becomes
avail- able. The results are undefined if the calling thread
holds the lock at the time the call is made. The
pthread_spin_trylock() function shall lock the spin lock
referenced by lock if it is not held by any thread.
Otherwise, the function shall fail.</p>

<p>The results are undefined if any of these functions is
called with an uninitialized spin lock.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, these functions
shall return zero; other- wise, an error number shall be
returned to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS These functions may fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The value specified by lock does not refer to an
initialized spin lock object.</p>

<p>The pthread_spin_lock() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EDEADLK The calling thread already holds the lock.</p>

<p>The pthread_spin_trylock() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EBUSY A thread currently holds the lock.</p>

<p>These functions shall not return an error code of
[EINTR].</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE Applications using this function may
be subject to priority inversion, as discussed in the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 3.285,
Priority Inversion.</p>

<p>The pthread_spin_lock() and pthread_spin_trylock()
functions are part of the Spin Locks option and need not be
provided on all implementa- tions.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
