<p>SEND(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual SEND(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME send - send a message on a socket</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;</p>

<p>ssize_t send(int socket, const void *buffer, size_t
length, int flags);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The send() function shall initiate
transmission of a message from the specified socket to its
peer. The send() function shall send a message only when the
socket is connected (including when the peer of a connec-
tionless socket has been set via connect()).</p>

<p>The send() function takes the following arguments:</p>

<p>socket Specifies the socket file descriptor.</p>

<p>buffer Points to the buffer containing the message to
send.</p>

<p>length Specifies the length of the message in bytes.</p>

<p>flags Specifies the type of message transmission. Values
of this argu- ment are formed by logically ORing zero or
more of the follow- ing flags:</p>

<p>MSG_EOR Terminates a record (if supported by the
protocol).</p>

<p>MSG_OOB Sends out-of-band data on sockets that support
out-of-band com- munications. The significance and semantics
of out-of-band data are protocol-specific.</p>

<p>The length of the message to be sent is specified by the
length argu- ment. If the message is too long to pass
through the underlying proto- col, send() shall fail and no
data shall be transmitted.</p>

<p>Successful completion of a call to send() does not
guarantee delivery of the message. A return value of -1
indicates only locally-detected errors.</p>

<p>If space is not available at the sending socket to hold
the message to be transmitted, and the socket file
descriptor does not have O_NONBLOCK set, send() shall block
until space is available. If space is not available at the
sending socket to hold the message to be transmitted, and
the socket file descriptor does have O_NONBLOCK set, send()
shall fail. The select() and poll() functions can be used to
determine when it is possible to send more data.</p>

<p>The socket in use may require the process to have
appropriate privi- leges to use the send() function.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, send() shall
return the number of bytes sent. Otherwise, -1 shall be
returned and errno set to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The send() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EAGAIN or EWOULDBLOCK</p>

<p>The socket s file descriptor is marked O_NONBLOCK and
the requested operation would block.</p>

<p>EBADF The socket argument is not a valid file
descriptor.</p>

<p>ECONNRESET A connection was forcibly closed by a
peer.</p>

<p>EDESTADDRREQ</p>

<p>The socket is not connection-mode and no peer address is
set.</p>

<p>EINTR A signal interrupted send() before any data was
transmitted.</p>

<p>EMSGSIZE The message is too large to be sent all at
once, as the socket requires.</p>

<p>ENOTCONN The socket is not connected or otherwise has
not had the peer pre-specified.</p>

<p>ENOTSOCK The socket argument does not refer to a
socket.</p>

<p>EOPNOTSUPP The socket argument is associated with a
socket that does not support one or more of the values set
in flags.</p>

<p>EPIPE The socket is shut down for writing, or the socket
is connec- tion-mode and is no longer connected. In the
latter case, and if the socket is of type SOCK_STREAM, the
SIGPIPE signal is gener- ated to the calling thread.</p>

<p>The send() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EACCES The calling process does not have the appropriate
privileges.</p>

<p>EIO An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing
to the file system.</p>

<p>ENETDOWN The local network interface used to reach the
destination is down.</p>

<p>ENETUNREACH</p>

<p>No route to the network is present.</p>

<p>ENOBUFS Insufficient resources were available in the
system to perform the operation.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The send() function is equivalent to
sendto() with a null pointer dest_len argument, and to
write() if no flags are used.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
