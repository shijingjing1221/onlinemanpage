<p>NAME oscap - OpenSCAP command line tool</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS oscap [general-options] module operation
[operation-options-and-argu- ments]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION oscap is Security Content Automation
Protocol (SCAP) toolkit based on OpenSCAP library. It
provides various functions for different SCAP specifications
(modules).</p>

<p>OpenSCAP tool claims to provide capabilities of
Authenticated Configu- ration Scanner and Authenticated
Vulnerability Scanner as defined by The National Institute
of Standards and Technology.</p>

<p>GENERAL OPTIONS -V, --version Print supported SCAP
specification, location of schema files, schematron files,
CPE files, probes and supported OVAL objects. Displays a
list of inbuilt CPE names.</p>

<p>-h, --help Help screen.</p>

<p>MODULES info Determine type and print information about
a file.</p>

<p>xccdf The eXtensible Configuration Checklist Description
Format.</p>

<p>oval Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language.</p>

<p>ds SCAP Data Stream</p>

<p>cpe Common Platform Enumeration.</p>

<p>cvss Common Vulnerability Scoring System</p>

<p>cve Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures</p>

<p>INFO OPERATIONS any-scap-file.xml This module prints
information about SCAP content in a file specified on a
command line. It determines SCAP content type, specification
version, date of creation, date of import and so on. Info
module doesnt require any additional opperation switch.</p>

<p>For XCCDF or Datastream files, info module prints out
IDs of incorporated profiles, components, and datastreams.
These IDs can be used to specify the target for evaluation.
Use options --profile, --xccdf-id (or --oval-id), and
--datastream-id respectively.</p>

<p>XCCDF OPERATIONS eval [options] INPUT_FILE
[oval-definitions-files] Perform evaluation of XCCDF
document file given as INPUT_FILE. Print result of each rule
to standard output, including rule title, rule id and
security identifier(CVE, CCE). Optionally you can give a
source datastream as the INPUT_FILE instead of an XCCDF file
(see --datastream-id).</p>

<p>oscap returns 0 if all rules pass. If there is an error
during evaluation, the return code is 1. If there is at
least one rule with either fail or unknown result,
oscap-scan finishes with return code 2.</p>

<p>Unless --skip-valid is used, the INPUT_FILE is validated
using XSD schemas (depending on document type of INPUT_FILE)
and rejected if invalid.</p>

<p>You may specify OVAL Definition files as the last
parameter, XCCDF evaluation will then proceed only with
those specified files. Otherwise, when
oval-definitions-files parameter is miss- ing, oscap tool
will try to load all OVAL Definition files ref- erenced from
XCCDF automatically (search in the same path as XCCDF).</p>

<p>--profile PROFILE Select a particular profile from XCCDF
document.</p>

<p>--tailoring-file TAILORING_FILE Use given file for XCCDF
tailoring. If both --tailoring- file and --tailoring-id are
specified, --tailoring files takes priority!</p>

<p>--tailoring-id COMPONENT_ID Use component of given ID
(in input source datastream) for XCCDF tailoring. If both
--tailoring-file and --tai- loring-id are specified,
--tailoring files takes prior- ity!</p>

<p>--cpe CPE_FILE Use given CPE dictionary or language
(auto-detected) for applicability checks. (Some CPE names
are provided by openscap, see oscap --version for Inbuilt
CPE names)</p>

<p>--results FILE Write XCCDF results into FILE.</p>

<p>--results-arf FILE Writes results to a given FILE in
Asset Reporting Format. It is recommended to use this option
instead of --results when dealing with datastreams.</p>

<p>--report FILE Write HTML report into FILE. You also have
to specify --results for this feature to work. Please see
--oval- results to enable additional information in the
report.</p>

<p>--oval-results Generate OVAL Result file for each OVAL
session used for evaluation. File with name
original-oval-definitions- filename.result.xml will be
generated for each refer- enced OVAL file in current working
directory. This option (in conjunction with the --report
option) also enables inclusion of additional OVAL
information in the XCCDF report. To change the directory
where OVAL files are gen- erated change the CWD using the cd
command.</p>

<p>--check-engine-results After evaluation is finished,
each loaded check engine plugin is asked to export its
results. The export itself is plugin specific, please refer
to documentation of the plugin for more details.</p>

<p>--export-variables Generate OVAL Variables documents
which contain external variables values that were provided
to the OVAL checking engine during evaluation. The filename
format is origi-
nal-oval-definitions-filename-session-index.variables-
variables-index.xml.</p>

<p>--datastream-id ID Uses a datastream with that
particular ID from the given datastream collection. If not
given the first datastream is used. Only applies if you give
source datastream in place of an XCCDF file.</p>

<p>--xccdf-id ID Takes component ref with given ID from
checklists. This allows to select a particular XCCDF
component even in cases where there are 2 XCCDFs in one
datastream. If none is given, the first component from the
checklists element is used.</p>

<p>--benchmark-id ID Selects a component ref from any
datastream that refer- ences a component with XCCDF
Benchmark such that its @id attribute matches given string
exactly. Please note that this is not the recommended way of
selecting a component- ref. You are advised to use
--xccdf-id AND/OR --datas- tream-id for more precision.
--benchmark-id is only used when both --xccdf-id and
--datastream-id are not present on the command line!</p>

<p>--skip-valid Do not validate input/output files.</p>

<p>--fetch-remote-resources Allow download of remote OVAL
content referenced from XCCDF by
check-content-ref/@href.</p>

<p>--remediate Execute XCCDF remediatation in the process
of XCCDF eval- uation. This option automatically executes
content of XCCDF fix elements for failed rules, and thus
this shall be avoided unless for trusted content. Use of
this option is always at your own risk.</p>

<p>remediate [options] INPUT_FILE [oval-definitions-files]
This module provides post-scan remediation. It assumes that
the INPUT_FILE is result of oscap xccdf eval operation. The
input file must contain TestResult element. This module
executes XCCDF fix elements for failed rule-result contained
in the given TestResult. Use of this option is always at
your own risk and it shall be avoided unless for trusted
content.</p>

<p>--result-id ID ID of the XCCDF TestResult element which
shall be remedi- ated. If this option is missing the last
TestResult (in top-down processing) will be remediated.</p>

<p>--skip-valid Do not validate input/output files.</p>

<p>--fetch-remote-resources Allow download of remote OVAL
content referenced from XCCDF by
check-content-ref/@href.</p>

<p>--cpe CPE_FILE Use given CPE dictionary or language
(auto-detected) for applicability checks.</p>

<p>--results FILE Write XCCDF results into FILE.</p>

<p>--results-arf FILE Writes results to a given FILE in
Asset Reporting Format. It is recommended to use this option
instead of --results when dealing with datastreams.</p>

<p>--report FILE Write HTML report into FILE. You also have
to specify --results for this feature to work.</p>

<p>--oval-results Generate OVAL Result file for each OVAL
session used for evaluation. File with name
original-oval-definitions- filename.result.xml will be
generated for each refer- enced OVAL file. This option (with
conjunction with the --report option) also enables inclusion
of additional OVAL information in the XCCDF report.</p>

<p>--check-engine-results After evaluation is finished,
each loaded check engine plugin is asked to export its
results. The export itself is plugin specific, please refer
to documentation of the plugin for more details.</p>

<p>--export-variables Generate OVAL Variables documents
which contain external variables values that were provided
to the OVAL checking engine during evaluation. The filename
format is origi-
nal-oval-definitions-filename-session-index.variables-
variables-index.xml.</p>

<p>resolve -o output-file xccdf-file Resolve an XCCDF file
as described in the XCCDF specification. It will flatten
inheritance hierarchy of XCCDF profiles, groups, rules, and
values. Result is another XCCDF document, which will be
written to output-file.</p>

<p>--force Force resolving XCCDF document even if it is
already marked as resolved.</p>

<p>validate [options] xccdf-file Validate given XCCDF file
against a XML schema. Every found error is printed to the
standard error. Return code is 0 if val- idation succeeds, 1
if validation could not be performed due to some error, 2 if
the XCCDF document is not valid.</p>

<p>--schematron Turn on Schematron-based validation. It is
able to find more errors and inconsistencies but is much
slower. Schematron is available only for XCCDF version
1.2.</p>

<p>export-oval-variables [options] xccdf-file
[oval-definitions-files] Collect all the XCCDF values that
would be used by OVAL during evaluation of a certain profile
and export them as OVAL exter- nal-variables document(s).
The filename format is original-
oval-definitions-filename-session-index.variables-variables-
index.xml.</p>

<p>--profile PROFILE Select a particular profile from XCCDF
document.</p>

<p>--fetch-remote-resources Allow download of remote OVAL
content referenced from XCCDF by
check-content-ref/@href.</p>

<p>--skip-valid Do not validate input/output files.</p>

<p>--datastream-id ID Uses a datastream with that
particular ID from the given datastream collection. If not
given the first datastream is used. Only applies if you give
source datastream in place of an XCCDF file.</p>

<p>--xccdf-id ID Takes component ref with given ID from
checklists. This allows to select a particular XCCDF
component even in cases where there are 2 XCCDFs in one
datastream.</p>

<p>--cpe CPE_FILE Use given CPE dictionary or language
(auto-detected) for applicability checks. The variables
documents are created only for xccdf:Rules which are
applicable.</p>

<p>generate [options] &lt;submodule&gt;
[submodule-specific-options] Generate another document form
an XCCDF file such as security guide or result report.</p>

<p>--profile ID Apply profile with given ID to the
Benchmark before fur- ther processing takes place.</p>

<p>--format FMT Specify output format. This option applies
only on docu- ment generators (i.e. guide, report).
Available formats: html (default), docbook.</p>

<p>Available submodules:</p>

<p>guide [options] xccdf-file Generate a formatted document
containing a security guide from a XCCDF Benchmark. Unless
the --output option is specified it will be written to the
standard output. Without profile being set only groups (not
rules) will be included in the output.</p>

<p>--output FILE Write the guide to this file instead of
standard output.</p>

<p>--hide-profile-info Information on chosen profile (e.g.
rules selected by the profile) will be excluded from the
document.</p>

<p>report [options] xccdf-file Generate a document
containing results of a XCCDF Bench- mark execution. Unless
the --output option is specified it will be written to the
standard output. ID of the TestResult element to visualise
defaults to the most recent result (according to the
end-time attribute).</p>

<p>--output FILE Write the report to this file instead of
standard output.</p>

<p>--result-id ID ID of the XCCDF TestResult from which the
report will be generated.</p>

<p>--show what Specify what result types shall be displayed
in the result report. The default is to show every- thing
except for rules with results notselected and notapplicable.
The what part is a comma-sepa- rated list of result types to
display in addition to the default. If result type is
prefixed by a dash - , it will be excluded from the results.
If what is prefixed by an equality sign =, a following list
specifies exactly what rule types to include in the report.
Result types are: pass, fixed, notchecked, notapplicable,
notselected, informational, unknown, error, fail.</p>

<p>--oval-template template-string To use the ability to
include additional informa- tion from OVAL in xccdf result
file, a template which will be used to obtain OVAL result
file names has to be specified. The template can be either a
filename or a string containing wildcard character (percent
sign % ). Wildcard will be replaced by the original OVAL
definition file name as referenced from the XCCDF file. This
way it is possible to obtain OVAL information even from
XCCDF documents referencing several OVAL files. To use this
option with results from an XCCDF evaluation, specify
%.result.xml as a OVAL file name template.</p>

<p>fix [options] xccdf-file Generate a script that shall
bring the system to a state of compliance with given XCCDF
Benchmark.</p>

<p>--output FILE Write the report to this file instead of
standard output.</p>

<p>--result-id ID Fixes will be generated for failed
rule-results of the specified TestResult.</p>

<p>--template ID|FILE Template to be used to generate the
script. If it contains a dot . it is interpreted as a loca-
tion of a file with the template definition. Oth- erwise it
identifies a template from standard set which currently
includes: bash (default if no --template switch present).
Brief explanation of the process of writing your own
templates is in the XSL file xsl/fix.xsl in the openscap
data directory. You can also take a look at the default
template xsl/fixtpl-bash.xml.</p>

<p>custom --stylesheet xslt-file [options] xccdf-file
Generate a custom output (depending on given XSLT file) from
an XCCDF file.</p>

<p>--stylesheet FILE Specify an absolute path to a custom
stylesheet to format the output.</p>

<p>--output FILE Write the document into file.</p>

<p>OVAL OPERATIONS eval [options] INPUT_FILE Probe the
system and evaluate all definitions from OVAL Defini- tion
file. Print result of each definition to standard output.
The return code is 0 after a successful evaluation. On
error, value 1 is returned.</p>

<p>INPUT_FILE can be either OVAL Definition File or SCAP
Source Datastream, it depends on used options.</p>

<p>Unless --skip-valid is used, the INPUT_FILE is validated
using XSD schemas (depending on document type of INPUT_FILE)
and rejected if invalid.</p>

particular ID from the given datastream collection. If not
given the first datastream is used. Only applies if you give
source datastream in place of an OVAL file.</p>

<p>--oval-id ID Takes component ref with given ID from
checks. This allows to select a particular OVAL component
even in cases where there are 2 OVALs in one datastream.</p>

<p>--skip-valid Do not validate input/output files.</p>

<p>collect [options] definitions-file Probe the system and
gather system characteristics for all objects in OVAL
Definition file.</p>

specified OVAL Object.</p>

<p>--variables FILE Provide external variables expected by
OVAL Definitions.</p>

<p>--syschar FILE Write OVAL System Characteristic into
file.</p>

<p>--skip-valid Do not validate input/output files.</p>

<p>analyse [options] --results FILE definitions-file
syschar-file In this mode, the oscap tool does not perform
data collection on the local system, but relies upon the
input file, which may have been generated on another system.
The output (OVAL Results) is printed to file specified by
--results parameter.</p>

<p>--variables FILE Provide external variables expected by
OVAL Definitions.</p>

<p>--directives FILE Use OVAL Directives content to specify
desired results content.</p>

<p>--skip-valid Do not validate input/output files.</p>

<p>validate [options] oval-file Validate given OVAL file
against a XML schema. Every found error is printed to the
standard error. Return code is 0 if validation succeeds, 1
if validation could not be performed due to some error, 2 if
the OVAL document is not valid.</p>

<p>--definitions, --variables, --syschar, --results
--directives Type of the OVAL document is automatically
detected by default. If you want enforce certain document
type, you can use one of these options.</p>

correct CPE format.</p>

<p>match name dictionary.xml Find an exact match of CPE
name in the dictionary.</p>

<p>validate cpe-dict-file Validate given CPE dictionary
file against a XML schema. Every found error is printed to
the standard error. Return code is 0 if validation succeeds,
1 if validation could not be performed due to some error, 2

SOURCE_XCCDF and stores the result in TARGET_SDS.
Dependencies like OVAL files are automatically detected and
bundled in target source datastream.</p>

<p>sds-add [options] NEW_COMPONENT EXISTING_SDS Adds given
NEW_COMPONENT file to the existing source datastream
(EXISTING_SDS). Component file might be OVAL, XCCDF or CPE
Dic- tionary file. Dependencies like OVAL files are
automatically detected an bundled in target source
datastream.</p>

<p>--datastream-id DATASTREAM_ID Uses a datastream with
that particular ID from the given datastream collection. If
not given the first datastream is used.</p>

<p>sds-split [options] SOURCE_DS TARGET_DIR Splits given
source datastream into multiple files and stores all the
files in TARGET_DIR.</p>

<p>--datastream-id DATASTREAM_ID Uses a datastream with
that particular ID from the given datastream collection. If
not given the first datastream is used.</p>

<p>--xccdf-id XCCDF_ID Takes component ref with given ID
from checklists. This allows to select a particular XCCDF
component even in cases where there are 2 XCCDFs in one
datastream.</p>

<p>sds-validate SOURCE_DS Validate given source datastream
file against a XML schema. Every found error is printed to
the standard error. Return code is 0 if validation succeeds,
1 if validation could not be per- formed due to some error,
2 if the source datastream is not valid.</p>

<p>rds-create SDS TARGET_ARF XCCDF_RESULTS [OVAL_RESULTS
[OVAL_RESULTS ..]] Takes given source datastream, XCCDF and
OVAL results and cre- ates a result datastream (in Asset
Reporting Format) and saves it to file given in
TARGET_ARF.</p>

<p>rds-split [--report-id REPORT_ID] RDS TARGET_DIR Takes
given result datastream (also called ARF = asset reporting
format) and splits given report and its respective report-
request to given target directory. If no report-id is given,
we assume user wants the first applicable report in top-down
order in the file.</p>

<p>rds-validate SOURCE_RDS Validate given result datastream
file against a XML schema. Every found error is printed to
the standard error. Return code is 0 if validation succeeds,
1 if validation could not be per- formed due to some error,
2 if the result datastream is not valid.</p>

<p>CVE OPERATIONS validate cve-nvd-feed.xml Validate given
CVE data feed.</p>

<p>find CVE cve-nvd-feed.xml Find given CVE in data feed
and report base score, vector string and vulnerable software
list.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS Normally, the exit status is 0 when
operation finished successfully and 1 otherwise. In cases
when oscap performs evaluation of the system it may return 2
indicating success of the operation but incompliance of the
assessed system.</p>
