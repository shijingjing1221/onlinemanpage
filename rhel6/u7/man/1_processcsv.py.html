<p>PROCESSCSV.PY(1) Virtualization Support
PROCESSCSV.PY(1)</p>

<p>NAME processcsv.py - process virt-top CSV files</p>

<p>SUMMARY virt-top --csv data.csv processcsv.py &lt;
data.csv</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION virt-top is a top(1)-like utility for
showing stats of virtualized domains.</p>

<p>processcsv.py is a simple Python script that
post-processes the output of &quot;virt-top --csv&quot;.</p>

<p>It is used like this:</p>

<p>virt-top --csv data.csv processcsv.py &lt; data.csv</p>

<p>The second command will overwrite the following files in
the current directory:</p>

<p>&quot;global.csv&quot; This contains the global (host)
statistics columns from the CSV file.</p>

<p>&quot;domainNN.csv&quot; (multiple files) For each
libvirt domain ID NN, a file is created containing the
per-domain statistics from the CSV file.</p>
