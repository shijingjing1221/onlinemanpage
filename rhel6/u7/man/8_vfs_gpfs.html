<p>VFS_GPFS(8) System Administration tools VFS_GPFS(8)</p>

<p>NAME vfs_gpfs - gpfs specific samba extensions like acls
and prealloc</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS vfs objects = gpfs</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This VFS module is part of the samba(7)
suite.</p>

<p>The gpfs VFS module is the home for all gpfs extensions
that Samba requires for proper integration with GPFS. It
uses the GPL library interfaces provided by GPFS.</p>

<p>Currently the gpfs vfs module provides extensions in
following areas :</p>

<p>&middot; NFSv4 ACL Interfaces with configurable options
for GPFS</p>

<p>&middot; Kernel oplock support on GPFS</p>

<p>&middot; Lease support on GPFS</p>

<p>NOTE:This module follows the posix-acl behaviour and
hence allows permission stealing via chown. Samba might
allow at a later point in time, to restrict the chown via
this module as such restrictions are the responsibility of
the underlying filesystem than of Samba.</p>

<p>This module is stackable.</p>

<p>OPTIONS gpfs:sharemodes = [ yes | no ] Enable/Disable
cross node sharemode handling for GPFS.</p>

<p>&middot; yes(default) - propagate sharemodes across all
GPFS nodes.</p>

<p>&middot; no - do not propagate sharemodes across all
GPFS nodes. This should only be used if the GPFS file system
is exclusively exported by Samba. Access by local unix
application or NFS exports could lead to corrupted
files.</p>

<p>gpfs:leases = [ yes | no ] Enable/Disable cross node
leases (oplocks) for GPFS. You should also set the oplocks
and kernel oplocks options to the same value.</p>

<p>&middot; yes(default) - propagate leases across all GPFS
nodes.</p>

<p>&middot; no - do not propagate leases across all GPFS
nodes. This should only be used if the GPFS file system is
exclusively exported by Samba. Access by local unix
application or NFS exports could lead to corrupted
files.</p>

<p>gpfs:hsm = [ yes | no ] Enable/Disable announcing if
this FS has HSM enabled.</p>

<p>&middot; no(default) - Do not announce HSM.</p>

<p>&middot; no - Announce HSM.</p>

<p>gpfs:getrealfilename = [ yes | no ] Enable/Disable usage
of the gpfs_get_realfilename_path() function. This improves
the casesensitive wildcard file name access.</p>

<p>&middot; yes(default) - use
gpfs_get_realfilename_path().</p>

<p>&middot; no - do not use gpfs_get_realfilename_path().
It seems that gpfs_get_realfilename_path() doesn&rsquo;t
work on AIX.</p>

<p>gpfs:winattr = [ yes | no ] Enable/Disable usage of the
windows attributes in GPFS. GPFS is able to store windows
file attributes e.g. HIDDEN, READONLY, SYSTEM and others
natively. That means Samba doesn&rsquo;t need to map them to
permission bits or extended attributes.</p>

<p>&middot; no(default) - do not use GPFS windows
attributes.</p>

<p>&middot; yes - use GPFS windows attributes.</p>

<p>gpfs:merge_writeappend = [ yes | no ] GPFS ACLs
doesn&rsquo;t know about the &rsquo;APPEND&rsquo; right.
This optionen lets Samba map the &rsquo;APPEND&rsquo; right
to &rsquo;WRITE&rsquo;.</p>

<p>&middot; yes(default) - map &rsquo;APPEND&rsquo; to
&rsquo;WRITE&rsquo;.</p>

<p>&middot; no - do not map &rsquo;APPEND&rsquo; to
&rsquo;WRITE&rsquo;.</p>

<p>gpfs:refuse_dacl_protected = [ yes | no ] As GPFS does
not support the ACE4_FLAG_NO_PROPAGATE NFSv4 flag (which
would be the mapping for the DESC_DACL_PROTECTED flag), the
status of this flag is currently silently ignored by Samba.
That means that if you deselect the &quot;Allow inheritable
permissions...&quot; checkbox in Windows&rsquo; ACL dialog
and then apply the ACL, the flag will be back
immediately.</p>

<p>To make sure that automatic migration with e.g. robocopy
does not lead to ACLs silently (and unintentionally)
changed, you can set gpfs:refuse_dacl_protected = yes to
enable an explicit check for this flag and if set, it will
return NT_STATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED so errors are shown up on the
Windows side and the Administrator is aware of the ACLs not
being settable like intended</p>

<p>&middot; no(default) - ignore the DESC_DACL_PROTECTED
flags.</p>

<p>&middot; yes - reject ACLs with DESC_DACL_PROTECTED.</p>

<p>nfs4:mode = [ simple | special ] Enable/Disable
substitution of special IDs on GPFS. This parameter should
not affect the windows users in anyway. It only ensures that
Samba sets the special IDs - OWNER@ and GROUP@ ( mappings to
simple uids ) that are relevant to GPFS.</p>

<p>The following MODEs are understood by the module:</p>

<p>&middot; simple(default) - do not use special IDs in
GPFS ACEs</p>

<p>&middot; special - use special IDs in GPFS ACEs.</p>

<p>nfs4:acedup = [dontcare|reject|ignore|merge] This
parameter configures how Samba handles duplicate ACEs
encountered in GPFS ACLs. GPFS allows/creates duplicate ACE
for different bits for same ID.</p>

<p>Following is the behaviour of Samba for different values
:</p>

<p>&middot; dontcare (default) - copy the ACEs as they
come</p>

<p>&middot; reject - stop operation and exit with error on
ACL set op</p>

<p>&middot; ignore - don&rsquo;t include the second
matching ACE</p>

<p>&middot; merge - bitwise OR the 2 ace.flag fields and 2
ace.mask fields of the 2 duplicate ACEs into 1 ACE</p>

<p>nfs4:chown = [yes|no] This parameter allows enabling or
disabling the chown supported by the underlying filesystem.
This parameter should be enabled with care as it might leave
your system insecure.</p>

<p>Some filesystems allow chown as a) giving b) stealing.
It is the latter that is considered a risk.</p>

<p>Following is the behaviour of Samba for different values
:</p>

<p>&middot; yes - Enable chown if as supported by the under
filesystem</p>

<p>&middot; no (default) - Disable chown</p>

<p>gpfs:syncio = [yes|no] This parameter makes Samba open
all files with O_SYNC. This triggers optimizations in GPFS
for workloads that heavily share files.</p>

<p>Following is the behaviour of Samba for different
values:</p>

<p>&middot; yesOpen files with O_SYNC</p>

<p>&middot; no (default)Open files as normal Samba would
do</p>

<p>EXAMPLES A GPFS mount can be exported via Samba as
follows :</p>

<p>[samba_gpfs_share] vfs objects = gpfs path =
/test/gpfs_mount nfs4: mode = special nfs4: acedup =
merge</p>

<p>CAVEATS Depending on the version of gpfs, the
libgpfs_gpl library or the libgpfs library is needed at
runtime by the gpfs VFS module: Starting with gpfs 3.2.1
PTF8, the complete libgpfs is available as open source and
libgpfs_gpl does no longer exist. With earlier versions of
gpfs, only the libgpfs_gpl library was open source and could
be used at run time.</p>

<p>At build time, only the header file gpfs_gpl.h is
required , which is a symlink to gpfs.h in gpfs versions
newer than 3.2.1 PTF8.</p>

<p>VERSION This man page is correct for version 3.0.25 of
the Samba suite.</p>

<p>AUTHOR The original Samba software and related utilities
were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by
the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way
the Linux kernel is developed.</p>

<p>The GPFS VFS module was created with contributions from
Volker Lendecke and the developers at IBM.</p>

<p>This manpage was created by the IBM FSCC team</p>
