<p>NAME groupdel - delete a group</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS groupdel group</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The groupdel command modifies the system
account files, deleting all entries that refer to group. The
named group must exist.</p>

<p>CAVEATS You may not remove the primary group of any
existing user. You must remove the user before you remove
the group.</p>

<p>You should manually check all file systems to ensure
that no files remain owned by this group.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION The following configuration variables in
/etc/login.defs change the behavior of this tool:</p>

<p>MAX_MEMBERS_PER_GROUP (number) Maximum members per group
entry. When the maximum is reached, a new group entry (line)
is started in /etc/group (with the same name, same password,
and same GID).</p>

<p>The default value is 0, meaning that there are no limits
in the number of members in a group.</p>

<p>This feature (split group) permits to limit the length
of lines in the group file. This is useful to make sure that
lines for NIS groups are not larger than 1024
characters.</p>

<p>If you need to enforce such limit, you can use 25.</p>

<p>Note: split groups may not be supported by all tools
(even in the Shadow toolsuite). You should not use this
variable unless you really need it.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/group Group account information.</p>

<p>/etc/gshadow Secure group account information.</p>

<p>EXIT VALUES The groupdel command exits with the
following values:</p>

<p>0 success</p>

<p>2 invalid command syntax</p>

<p>6 specified group doesn&acute;t exist</p>

<p>8 can&acute;t remove user&acute;s primary group</p>

<p>10 can&acute;t update group file</p>
