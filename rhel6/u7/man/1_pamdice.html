<p>NAME pamdice - slice a Netpbm image into many
horizontally and/or vertically</p>

<p>EXAMPLE $ pamdice myimage.ppm -outstem=myimage_part
-width=10 -height=8 $ pamundice myimage_part_%1d_%1a.ppm
-across=10 -down=8 &gt;myimage.ppm</p>

<p>$ pamdice myimage.ppm -outstem=myimage_part -height=12
-voverlap=9</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pamdice</p>

<p>-outstem=filenamestem</p>

<p>[-width=width]</p>

<p>[-height=height]</p>

<p>[-hoverlap=hoverlap]</p>

<p>[-voverlap=voverlap]</p>

<p>[-verbose]</p>

<p>[filename]</p>

<p>You can use the minimum unique abbreviation of the
options. You can use two hyphens instead of one. You can
separate an option name from its value with white space
instead of an equals sign.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pamdice reads a PAM, PBM, PGM, or PPM image as input and
splits it hor- izontally and/or vertically into equal size
pieces and writes them into separate files as the same kind
of image. You can optionally make the pieces overlap.</p>

<p>See the -outstem option for information on naming of the
output files.</p>

<p>The -width and -height options determine the size of the
output pieces.</p>

<p>pamundice can rejoin the images. For finer control, you
can also use</p>

<p>pnmcat.</p>

<p>One use for this is to make pieces that take less
computer resources than the whole image to process. For
example, you might have an image so large that an image
editor cant read it all into memory or pro- cesses it very
slowly. With pamdice, you can split it into smaller pieces,
edit one at a time, and then reassemble them.</p>

<p>Another use for this is to print a large image in small
printer-sized pieces that you can glue together. ppmglobe
does a similar thing; it lets you glue the pieces together
into a sphere.</p>

<p>If you want to cut pieces from an image individually,
not in a regular grid, use pamcut.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -outstem=filenamestem This option determines the
names of the output files. Each out- put file is named
filenamestem_y_x.type where filenamestem is the value of the
-outstem option, x and y are the horizontal and vertical
locations, respectively, in the input image of the out- put
image, zero being the leftmost and top, and type is .pbm,
.pgm, .ppm, or .pam, depending on the type of image.</p>

<p>-width=width gives the width in pixels of the output
images. The rightmost pieces are smaller than this if the
input image is not a multi- ple of width pixels wide.</p>

<p>-height=height gives the height in pixels of the output
images. The bottom pieces are smaller than this if the input
image is not a multi- ple of height pixels high.</p>

<p>-hoverlap=hoverlap gives the horizontal overlap in
pixels between output images. Each image in a row will
overlap the previous one by hoverlap pixels. By default,
there is no overlap.</p>

<p>This option was new in Netpbm 10.23 (July 2004).</p>

<p>-voverlap=voverlap gives the vertical overlap in pixels
between output images. Each row of images will overlap the
previous row by voverlap pixels. By default, there is no
overlap.</p>

<p>This option was new in Netpbm 10.23 (July 2004).</p>

<p>-verbose Print information about the processing to
Standard Error.</p>

<p>HISTORY pamdice was new in Netpbm 9.25 (March 2002).</p>

<p>Before Netpbm 10.29 (August 2005), there was a limit of
100 slices in each direction.</p>
