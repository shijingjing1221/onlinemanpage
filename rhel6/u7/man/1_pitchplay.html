<p>This manpage describes the program implementation of
pitchplay as shipped by the cdrkit distribution. See
http://alioth.debian.org/projects/debburn/ for details. It
is a spinoff from the original program distributed by the
cdrtools project. However, the cdrtools developers are not
involved in the development of this spinoff and therefore
shall not be made responsible for any problem caused by it.
Do not try to get support for this program by contacting the
original authors.</p>
