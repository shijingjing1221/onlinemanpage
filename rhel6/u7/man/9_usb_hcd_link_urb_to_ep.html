<p>USB_HCD_LINK_URB_TO_(9) Host Controller APIs
USB_HCD_LINK_URB_TO_(9)</p>

<p>NAME usb_hcd_link_urb_to_ep - add an URB to its endpoint
queue</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS int usb_hcd_link_urb_to_ep(struct usb_hcd *
hcd, struct urb * urb);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS hcd host controller to which urb was
submitted</p>

<p>urb URB being submitted</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Host controller drivers should call this
routine in their enqueue method. The HCD&acute;s private
spinlock must be held and interrupts must be disabled. The
actions carried out here are required for URB submission, as
well as for endpoint shutdown and for usb_kill_urb.</p>

<p>Returns 0 for no error, otherwise a negative error code
(in which case the enqueue method must fail). If no error
occurs but enqueue fails anyway, it must call
usb_hcd_unlink_urb_from_ep before releasing the private
spinlock and returning.</p>
