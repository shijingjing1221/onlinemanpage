<p>NAME glutSetWindowTitle - Request changing the title of
the current window</p>

<p>LIBRARY OpenGLUT - window</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;openglut.h&gt;</p>

<p>void glutSetWindowTitle(const char* title);</p>

<p>PARAMETERS title New window title</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION glutSetWindowTitle() requests that the
window system change the title of the window.</p>

<p>Normally a window system displays a title for every
top-level window in the system. The initial title is set
when you call glutCreateWindow(). By means of this function
you can set the titles for your top-level OpenGLUT
windows.</p>

<p>Some window systems do not provide titles for windows,
in which case this function may have no useful effect.</p>

<p>Because the effect may be delayed or lost, you should
not count on the effect of this function. However, it can be
a nice touch to use the win- dow title bar for a one-line
status bar in some cases. Use discretion.</p>

<p>If you just want one title for the window over the
windows entire life, you should set it when you open the
window with glutCreateWindow().</p>

<p>CAVEATS Only for managed, onscreen, top-level
windows.</p>

<p>Not all window systems display titles.</p>

<p>May be ignored or delayed by window manager.</p>
