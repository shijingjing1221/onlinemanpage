<p>NAME XOrgFoundation - X.Org Foundation information</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS Release 7.0 of X Version 11 is brought to you
by the X.Org Foundation, LLC.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The X.Org Foundation is an independent,
not-for-profit 501(c)(3) char- ity corporation. It was
formed in 2004 as the successor to the X.Org Group at The
Open Group. The purpose of the X.Org Foundation is to fos-
ter the development, evolution, and maintenance of the X
Window System, a comprehensive set of vendor-neutral,
system-architecture neutral, network-transparent windowing
and user interface standards. Membership in the X.Org
Foundation is free and open to anyone. The X.Org Founda-
tion hosts a public CVS repository of the source code on
Freedesk- top.Org.</p>

<p>The X Window System was created in the mid-1980s at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In 1988, MIT formed a
member-funded consor- tium to provide the technical and
administrative leadership necessary to support further
development of the X Window System. In 1992, MIT and the
membership decided it was in their best interests to move
the consortium out of MIT and create an independent,
stand-alone organiza- tion. All rights to the X Window
System were assigned by MIT to X Con- sortium, Inc. on
January 1, 1994. On December 31, 1996 the X Consor- tium,
Inc. closed its doors and all rights to the X Window System
were assigned to The Open Group (then known as the Open
Software Founda- tion.)</p>
