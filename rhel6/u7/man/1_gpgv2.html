<p>NAME gpgv2 - Verify OpenPGP signatures</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS gpgv2 [options] signed_files</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION gpgv2 is an OpenPGP signature verification
tool.</p>

<p>This program is actually a stripped-down version of gpg
which is only able to check signatures. It is somewhat
smaller than the fully-blown gpg and uses a different (and
simpler) way to check that the public keys used to make the
signature are valid. There are no configuration files and
only a few options are implemented.</p>

<p>gpgv2 assumes that all keys in the keyring are
trustworthy. By default it uses a keyring named
trustedkeys.gpg which is assumed to be in the home directory
as defined by GnuPG or set by an option or an environ- ment
variable. An option may be used to specify another keyring
or even multiple keyrings.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The program returns 0 if everything is
fine, 1 if at least one signa- ture was bad, and other error
codes for fatal errors.</p>

<p>OPTIONS gpgv2 recognizes these options:</p>

<p>--verbose</p>

<p>-v Gives more information during processing. If used
twice, the input data is listed in detail.</p>

<p>--quiet</p>

<p>-q Try to be as quiet as possible.</p>

<p>--keyring file Add file to the list of keyrings. If file
begins with a tilde and a slash, these are replaced by the
HOME directory. If the filename does not contain a slash, it
is assumed to be in the home-directory (&quot;~/.gnupg&quot;
if --homedir is not used).</p>

<p>--status-fd n Write special status strings to the file
descriptor n. See the file DETAILS in the documentation for
a listing of them.</p>

<p>--logger-fd n Write log output to file descriptor n and
not to stderr.</p>

<p>--ignore-time-conflict GnuPG normally checks that the
timestamps associated with keys and signatures have
plausible values. However, sometimes a sig- nature seems to
be older than the key due to clock problems. This option
turns these checks into warnings.</p>

<p>--homedir dir Set the name of the home directory to dir.
If this option is not used, the home directory defaults to
~/.gnupg. It is only recognized when given on the command
line. It also overrides any home directory stated through
the environment variable GNUPGHOME or (on W32 systems) by
means of the Registry entry
HKCUSoftwareGNUGnuPG:HomeDir.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES gpgv2 pgpfile</p>

<p>gpgv2 sigfile [datafile] Verify the signature of the
file. The second form is used for detached signatures, where
sigfile is the detached signature (either ASCII-armored or
binary) and datafile contains the signed data; if datafile
is &quot;-&quot; the signed data is expected on stdin; if
datafile is not given the name of the file holding the
signed data is constructed by cutting off the extension
(&quot;.asc&quot;, &quot;.sig&quot; or &quot;.sign&quot;)
from sigfile.</p>

<p>FILES ~/.gnupg/trustedkeys.gpg The default keyring with
the allowed keys.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT HOME Used to locate the default home
directory.</p>

<p>GNUPGHOME If set directory used instead of
&quot;~/.gnupg&quot;.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO gpg2(1)</p>

<p>The full documentation for this tool is maintained as a
Texinfo manual. If GnuPG and the info program are properly
installed at your site, the command</p>

<p>info gnupg</p>

<p>should give you access to the complete manual including
a menu struc- ture and an index.</p>
