<p>ETEX(1) Web2C 7.5.6 ETEX(1)</p>

<p>NAME etex, einitex, evirtex - extended TeX</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS etex [options] [&amp; format ] [ file |
commands ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Run the e-TeX typesetter on file, usually
creating file.dvi. If the file argument has no extension,
&quot;.tex&quot; will be appended to it. Instead of a
filename, a set of e-TeX commands can be given, the first of
which must start with a backslash. With a &amp;format
argument e-TeX uses a dif- ferent set of precompiled
commands, contained in format.fmt; it is usu- ally better to
use the -fmt format option instead.</p>

<p>e-TeX is the first concrete result of an international
research &amp; development project, the NTS Project, which
was established under the aegis of DANTE e.V. during 1992.
The aims of the project are to perpet- uate and develop the
spirit and philosophy of TeX, whilst respecting Knuths wish
that TeX should remain frozen.</p>

<p>e-TeX can be used in two different modes: in
compatibility mode it is supposed to be completely
interchangable with standard TeX. In extended mode several
new primitives are added that facilitate (among other
things) bidirectional typesetting.</p>

<p>An extended mode format is generated by prefixing the
name of the source file for the format with an asterisk (*).
Such formats are often prefixed with an e, hence etex as the
extended version of tex and elatex as the extended version
of latex. However, eplain is an exception to this rule.</p>

<p>The einitex and evirtex commands are e-TeX s analogues
to the initex and virtex commands. In this installation,
they are symbolic links to the etex executable. These
symbolic links may not exist at all.</p>

<p>e-TeX s handling of its command-line arguments is
similar to that of the other TeX programs in the web2c
implementation.</p>

<p>OPTIONS This version of e-TeX understands the following
command line options.</p>

<p>-fmt format Use format as the name of the format to be
used, instead of the name by which e-TeX was called or a
%&amp; line.</p>

<p>-enc Enable the encTeX extensions. This option is only
effective in combination with -ini. For documentation of the
encTeX exten- sions see
http://www.olsak.net/enctex.html.</p>

<p>-etex Enable the e-TeX extensions. This option is only
effective in combination with -ini.</p>

<p>-file-line-error Print error messages in the form
file:line:error which is simi- lar to the way many compilers
format them.</p>

<p>-no-file-line-error Disable printing error messages in
the file:line:error style.</p>

<p>-file-line-error-style This is the old name of the
-file-line-error option.</p>

<p>-halt-on-error Exit with an error code when an error is
encountered during pro- cessing.</p>

<p>-help Print help message and exit.</p>

<p>-ini Start in INI mode, which is used to dump formats.
The INI mode can be used for typesetting, but no format is
preloaded, and basic initializations like setting catcodes
may be required.</p>

<p>-interaction mode Sets the interaction mode. The mode
can be either batchmode, nonstopmode, scrollmode, and
errorstopmode. The meaning of these modes is the same as
that of the corresponding -ipc Send DVI output to a socket
as well as the usual output file. Whether this option is
available is the choice of the installer.</p>

<p>-ipc-start As -ipc, and starts the server at the other
end as well. Whether this option is available is the choice
of the installer.</p>

<p>-jobname name Use name for the job name, instead of
deriving it from the name of the input file.</p>

<p>-kpathsea-debug bitmask Sets path searching debugging
flags according to the bitmask. See the Kpathsea manual for
details.</p>

<p>-mktex fmt Enable mktexfmt, where fmt must be either tex
or tfm.</p>

<p>-mltex Enable MLTeX extensions. Only effective in
combination with -ini.</p>

<p>-no-mktex fmt Disable mktexfmt, where fmt must be either
tex or tfm.</p>

<p>-output-comment string Use string for the DVI file
comment instead of the date.</p>

<p>-output-directory directory directory instead of the
current directory. Look up input files in directory first,
the along the normal search path.</p>

<p>-parse-first-line If the first line of the main input
file begins with %&amp; parse it to look for a dump name or
a -translate-file option.</p>

<p>-no-parse-first-line Disable parsing of the first line
of the main input file.</p>

<p>-progname name Pretend to be program name. This affects
both the format used and the search paths.</p>

<p>-recorder Enable the filename recorder. This leaves a
trace of the files opened for input and output in a file
with extension .fls.</p>

<p>-shell-escape Enable the48rite18{command} construct. The
command can be any shell command. This construct is normally
disallowed for secu- rity reasons.</p>

<p>-no-shell-escape Disable the48rite18{command} construct,
even if it is enabled in the texmf.cnf file.</p>

<p>-src-specials Insert source specials into the DVI
file.</p>

<p>-src-specials where Insert source specials in certain
placed of the DVI file. where is a comma-separated value
list: cr, display, hbox, math, par, parent, or vbox.</p>

<p>-translate-file tcxname Use the tcxname translation
table to set the mapping of input characters and re-mapping
of output characters.</p>

<p>-default-translate-file tcxname Like -translate-file
except that a %&amp; line can overrule this setting.</p>

<p>-version Print version information and exit.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT See the Kpathsearch library documentation
(the Path specifications node) for precise details of how
the environment variables are used. The kpsewhich utility
can be used to query the values of the variables.</p>

<p>One caveat: In most e-TeX formats, you cannot use ~ in a
filename you give directly to e-TeX, because ~ is an active
character, and hence is expanded, not taken as part of the
filename. Other programs, such as Metafont, do not have this
problem.</p>

<p>TEXMFOUTPUT Normally, e-TeX puts its output files in the
current directory. If any output file cannot be opened
there, it tries to open it in the directory specified in the
environment variable TEXMFOUT- PUT. There is no default
value for that variable. For example, if you say etex paper
and the current directory is not writable, if TEXMFOUTPUT
has the value /tmp, e-TeX attempts to create /tmp/paper.log
(and /tmp/paper.dvi, if any output is produced.)</p>

<p>TEXINPUTS Search path for input and openin files. This
should probably start with ., so that user files are found
before system files. An empty path component will be
replaced with the paths defined in the texmf.cnf file. For
example, set TEXINPUTS to &quot;.:/home/usr/tex:&quot; to
prepend the current direcory and /home/user/tex to the
standard search path.</p>

<p>TEXFORMATS Search path for format files.</p>

<p>TEXPOOL search path for etex internal strings.</p>

<p>TEXEDIT Command template for switching to editor. The
default, usually vi, is set when e-TeX is compiled.</p>

<p>TFMFONTS Search path for font metric (.tfm) files.</p>

<p>FILES The location of the files mentioned below varies
from system to system. Use the kpsewhich utility to find
their locations.</p>

<p>etex.pool Text file containing e-TeXs internal
strings.</p>

<p>texfonts.map Filename mapping definitions.</p>

<p>*.tfm Metric files for e-TeXs fonts.</p>

<p>*.fmt Predigested e-TeX format (.fmt) files.</p>

<p>NOTES Starting with version 1.40, pdfTeX incorporates
the e-TeX extensions, so in this installation eTeX is just a
symbolic link to pdfTeX. See pdftex(1). This manual page is
not meant to be exhaustive. The com- plete documentation for
this version of e-TeX can be found in the info manual Web2C:
A TeX implementation.</p>

<p>BUGS This version of e-TeX implements a number of
optional extensions. In fact, many of these extensions
conflict to a greater or lesser extent with the definition
of e-TeX. When such extensions are enabled, the banner
printed when e-TeX starts is changed to print e-TeXk instead
of e-TeX.</p>

<p>This version of e-TeX fails to trap arithmetic overflow
when dimensions are added or subtracted. Cases where this
occurs are rare, but when it does the generated DVI file
will be invalid.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO pdftex(1), tex(1), mf(1).</p>

<p>AUTHORS e-TeX was developed by Peter Breitenlohner (and
the NTS team).</p>

<p>TeX was designed by Donald E. Knuth, who implemented it
using his sys- tem for Pascal programs. It was ported to
Unix at Stanford by Howard Trickey, and at Cornell by Pavel
Curtis. The version now offered with the Unix TeX
distribution is that generated by the to C system (web2c),
originally written by Tomas Rokicki and Tim Morgan.</p>

<p>The encTeX extensions were written by Petr Olsak.</p>
