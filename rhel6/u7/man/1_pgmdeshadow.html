<p>NAME pgmdeshadow - Deshadow a PGM image</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pgmdeshadow</p>

<p>[pnmfile]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pgmdeshadow removes gray shadows from an image. This is
useful for an image containing text, such as a scanned book
pages, where a shadow typically appears near the book crease
or near one side of the image. pgmdeshadow recognizes a gray
shadow as an area of smoothly changing color, starting from
the outer edges of the image. The program uses a simple
image reconstruction algorithm to determine the local shadow
gray level, then divides each pixels gray level by the local
shadow gray level.</p>

<p>The algorithm is the fast hybrid grayscale reruction
algorithm from Luc Vincent, &quot;Morphological Grayscale
Reruction in Image Analysis: Applications and Efficient
Algorithms.</p>

<p>OPTIONS None.</p>
