<p>AMREPORT(8) System Administration Commands
AMREPORT(8)</p>

<p>NAME amreport - generate a formatted output of
statistics for an Amanda run</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS amreport [config] [-i] [-M address] [-l
logfile] [-f outputfile] [-p postscriptfile] [-o
configoption]...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Amreport generates a summary report of an
amanda(8) backup run. If no configuration name is specified,
amanda.conf is read from the current directory.</p>

<p>See the amanda(8) man page for more details about
Amanda.</p>

<p>OPTIONS config Name of the configuration to process.</p>

<p>-i Don&acute;t email the report.</p>

<p>-M address Mail the report to address instead of the
mailto value from amanda.conf.</p>

<p>-l logfile Name of the log file to parse to generate the
report. If a log file is not specified, it defaults to the
file:</p>

<p>logdir/log</p>

<p>where logdir is the log directory defined in
amanda.conf.</p>

<p>-f outputfile Normally, amreport sends the report via
e-mail to the mailto user as defined in the amanda.conf
file. If outputfile is specified, then the report is put in
outputfile.</p>

<p>-p postscriptfile Send the postscript output to the file
postscriptfile instead of to the lpr(1) command. This option
has an effect only if the lbl-templ directive is specified
in amanda.conf.</p>

<p>-o configoption See the &quot;CONFIGURATION
OVERRIDE&quot; section in amanda(8).</p>

<p>LABEL PRINTING Amanda can print postscript labels
describing the contents of tape(s) written in a run. The
labels are designed to be folded and inserted into the tape
case along with the tape or hole punched and put in a 3-ring
binder. Various label templates are provided to format data
for different tape sizes.</p>

<p>The information printed varies slightly between label
templates due to size constraints. Labels contain one line
for each host/file-system pair and may also contain the file
number on the tape, the level of the dump, the original size
of the dump and the size of the (possibly compressed) tape
file.</p>

<p>Add the lbl-templ parameter to the tapetype definition
in amanda.conf to enable labels. If you don&acute;t add this
line to your tapetype definition, amreport will not print
tape labels.</p>

<p>You may use the remap=&acute;I&acute;&gt;printer keyword
in amanda.conf to print to other than the system default
printer.</p>

<p>TEMPLATES Amanda provides label templates for the
following tape types. These are pretty generic labels and
should be easy to customize for other tape types or
particular site needs.</p>

<p>* ExaByte 8mm tapes * DAT 4mm tapes * DLT tapes * 3-ring
binder</p>

<p>The 3-ring binder type is the most generic. It may be
used to make a hardcopy log of the tapes.</p>

<p>EXIT CODE The exit code of amreport is the ORed value
of: 0 = success 1 = error 2 = a dle give strange message 4 =
a dle failed 8 = Don&acute;t know the status of a dle
(RESULT_MISSING in the report) 16 = tape error or no more
tape</p>
