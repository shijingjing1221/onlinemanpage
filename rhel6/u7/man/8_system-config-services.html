<p>NAME system-config-services - Service Configuration
Utility</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS system-config-services</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This is a graphical tool for enabling and
disabling services (including xinetd services).
Functionality to start, stop, and restart services is also
included.</p>

<p>OPTIONS None</p>

<p>FILES /usr/bin/system-config-services
/usr/share/system-config-services/*</p>

<p>EXAMPLES To run this program simply type:</p>

<p>system-config-services</p>

<p>SEE ALSO chkconfig(8) ntsysv(8)</p>

<p>BUGS - Some services will not start or stop properly if
started anywhere but the console (system-config-services
will appear to hang in these instances). This is not a bug
in system-config-services, but in the individual
services.</p>

<p>- Some services are incredibly hard to detect if they
are running or not. While there are workarounds present to
deal with these, it cant be guaranteed that theyre detected
properly. Please file bugs against the
system-config-services component at
http://bugzilla.redhat.com if you encounter such
services.</p>
