<p>NAME pnmshear - shear a PNM image by a specified
angle</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pnmshear</p>

<p>[-noantialias] [-background=color] angle [pnmfile]</p>

<p>All options can be abbreviated to their shortest unique
prefix. You may use two hyphens instead of one to designate
an option. You may use either white space or equals signs
between an option name and its value.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pnmshear reads a PNM image as input and shears it by the
specified angle and produce a PNM image as output. If the
input file is in color, the output will be too, otherwise it
will be grayscale. The angle is in degrees (floating point),
and measures this:</p>

<p>+-------+ +-------+ | | | | OLD | | NEW | | |an
+-------+ |gle+-------+</p>

<p>If the angle is negative, it shears the other way:
+-------+ |-an+-------+ | | |gl/ / | OLD | |e/ NEW / | | |/
/ +-------+ +-------+</p>

<p>The angle should not get too close to 90 or -90, or the
resulting image will be unreasonably wide.</p>

<p>pnmshear does the shearing by looping over the source
pixels and dis- tributing fractions to each of the
destination pixels. This has an anti-aliasing effect - it
avoids jagged edges and similar artifacts. However, it also
means that the original colors in the image are modi- fied
and there are typically more of them than you started with.
If you need to keep precisely the same set of colors, see
the -noantialias option. If the expanded palette is a
problem, you can run the result through pnmquant.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -background=color This determines the color of
the background on which the sheared image sits.</p>

<p>Specify the color (color) as described for the argument
of the ppm_parsecolor() library routine .</p>

<p>By default, if you don t specify this option, pnmshear
selects what appears to it to be the background color of the
original image. It determines this color rather
simplisticly, by taking an average of the colors of the two
top corners of the image.</p>

<p>This option was new in Netpbm 10.37 (December 2006).
Before that, pnmshear always behaved as is the default
now.</p>

<p>-noantialias This option forces pnmrotate to simply move
pixels around instead of synthesizing output pixels from
multiple input pix- els. The latter could cause the output
to contain colors that are not in the input, which may not
be desirable. It also prob- ably makes the output contain a
large number of colors. If you need a small number of
colors, but it doesnt matter if they are the exact ones from
the input, consider using pnmquant on the output instead of
using -noantialias.</p>

<p>Note that to ensure the output does not contain colors
that are not in the input, you also must consider the
background color. See the -background option.</p>
