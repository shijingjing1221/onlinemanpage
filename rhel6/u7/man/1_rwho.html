<p>RWHO(1) BSD General Commands Manual RWHO(1)</p>

<p>NAME rwho - who is logged in on local machines</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rwho [-a]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The rwho command produces output similar to
who, but for all machines on the local network. If no report
has been received from a machine for 11 minutes then rwho
assumes the machine is down, and does not report users last
known to be logged into that machine.</p>

<p>If a users hasnt typed to the system for a minute or
more, then rwho reports this idle time. If a user hasnt
typed to the system for an hour or more, then the user will
be omitted from the output of rwho unless the -a flag is
given.</p>

<p>FILES /var/spool/rwho/whod.* information about other
machines</p>

<p>SEE ALSO finger(1), rup(1), ruptime(1), rusers(1),
who(1), rwhod(8)</p>

<p>HISTORY The rwho command appeared in 4.3BSD.</p>

<p>BUGS This is unwieldy when the number of machines on the
local net is large.</p>
