<p>syndaemon(1) syndaemon(1)</p>

<p>NAME syndaemon - a program that monitors keyboard
activity and disables the touchpad when the keyboard is
being used.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS syndaemon [-i idle-time] [-m poll-inverval]
[-d] [-p pid-file] [-t] [-k] [-K] [-R]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Disabling the touchpad while typing avoids
unwanted movements of the pointer that could lead to giving
focus to the wrong window.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -i &lt;idle-time&gt; How many seconds to wait
after the last key press before enabling the touchpad.
(default is 2.0s).</p>

<p>-m &lt;poll-interval&gt; How many milliseconds to wait
between two polling intervals. If this value is too low, it
will cause unnecessary wake-ups. If this value is too high,
some key presses (press and release hap- pen between two
intervals) may not be noticed. This switch has no effect
when running with -R. Default is 200ms.</p>

<p>-d Start as a daemon, ie in the background.</p>

<p>-p &lt;pid-file&gt; Create a pid file with the specified
filename. A pid file will only be created if the program is
started in daemon mode.</p>

<p>-t Only disable tapping and scrolling, not mouse
movements, in response to keyboard activity.</p>

<p>-k Ignore modifier keys when monitoring keyboard
activity.</p>

<p>-K Like -k but also ignore Modifier+Key combos.</p>

<p>-R Use the XRecord extension for detecting keyboard
activity instead of polling the keyboard state.</p>

<p>-? Show the help message.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES DISPLAY Specifies the X server to
contact.</p>

<p>EXIT CODES If syndaemon exists with a return code other
than 0, the error encoun- tered is as below.</p>

<p>Exit code 1 Invalid commandline argument.</p>

<p>Exit code 2 The connection to the X sever could not be
established or no touchpad device could be found.</p>

<p>Exit code 3 The fork into daemon mode failed or the pid
file could not be created.</p>

<p>Exit code 4 XRECORD requested but not available or
usable on the server.</p>

<p>CAVEATS It doesnt make much sense to connect to a remote
X server, because the daemon will then monitor the remote
server for keyboard activity, but will disable the touchpad
on the local machine.</p>
