<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME colon - null utility</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS : [argument ...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This utility shall only expand command
arguments. It is used when a command is needed, as in the

<p>As with any of the special built-ins, the null utility
can also have variable assignments and redirections
associated with it, such as:</p>

<p>x=y : &gt; z</p>

<p>which sets variable x to the value y (so that it
persists after the null utility completes) and creates or
truncates file z.</p>
