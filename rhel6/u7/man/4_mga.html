<p>NAME mga - Matrox video driver</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS Section &quot;Device&quot; Identifier
&quot;devname&quot; Driver &quot;mga&quot; ...
EndSection</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION mga is an Xorg driver for Matrox video
cards. The driver is fully accelerated, and provides support
for the following framebuffer depths: 8, 15, 16, 24, and an
8+24 overlay mode. All visual types are sup- ported for
depth 8, and both TrueColor and DirectColor visuals are sup-
ported for the other depths except 8+24 mode which supports
Pseudo- Color, GrayScale and TrueColor. Multi-card
configurations are sup- ported. XVideo is supported on G200
and newer systems, with either TexturedVideo or video
overlay. The second head of dual-head cards is supported for
the G450 and G550. Support for the second head on G400 cards
requires a binary-only &quot;mga_hal&quot; module that is
available from Matrox &lt;http://www.matrox.com&gt;, and may
be on the CD supplied with the card. That module also
provides various other enhancements, and may be necessary to
use the DVI (digital) output on the G550 (and other
cards).</p>

<p>SUPPORTED HARDWARE The mga driver supports PCI and AGP
video cards based on the following Matrox chips. They are
listed in approximate chronological order of production
(with the most recent chipsets listed last), so consult this
list when you are unsure whether your card is meant when
references are made to G200 and later chips, for
example.</p>

<p>MGA2064W</p>

<p>MGA1064SG Mystique</p>

<p>MGA2164W Millennium II</p>

<p>G100 Productiva G100</p>

<p>G200 Millennium G200 and Mystique G200</p>

<p>G400 Millennium G400, Millennium G400 MAX, Millennium
G450, and Mar- vel G450 eTV</p>

<p>G550 Millennium G550 and Millennium G550 Dual DVI</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION DETAILS Please refer to xorg.conf(5) for
general configuration details. This section only covers
configuration details specific to this driver.</p>

<p>The driver auto-detects the chipset type, but the
following ChipSet names may optionally be specified in the
config file &quot;Device&quot; section, and will override
the auto-detection:</p>

<p>&quot;mga2064w&quot;, &quot;mga1064sg&quot;,
&quot;mga2164w&quot;, &quot;mga2164w agp&quot;,
&quot;mgag100&quot;, &quot;mgag200&quot;, &quot;mgag200
pci&quot;, &quot;mgag400&quot;, &quot;mgag550&quot;.</p>

<p>The G450 is Chipset &quot;mgag400&quot; with ChipRev
0x80.</p>

<p>The driver will auto-detect the amount of video memory
present for all chips except the Millennium II. In the
Millennium II case it defaults to 4096 kBytes. When using a
Millennium II, the actual amount of video memory should be
specified with a VideoRam entry in the config file
&quot;Device&quot; section.</p>

<p>The following driver Options are supported:</p>

<p>Option &quot;ColorKey&quot; &quot;integer&quot; Set the
colormap index used for the transparency key for the depth 8
plane when operating in 8+24 overlay mode. The value must be
in the range 2-255. Default: 255.</p>

<p>Option &quot;HWCursor&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Enable
or disable the HW cursor. Default: on.</p>

<p>Option &quot;MGASDRAM&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Specify
whether G100, G200 or G400 cards have SDRAM. The driver
attempts to auto-detect this based on the card s PCI
subsystem ID. This option may be used to override that
auto-detection. The mga driver is not able to auto-detect
the presence of of SDRAM on secondary heads in multihead
configurations so this option will often need to be
specified in multihead configura- tions. Default:
auto-detected.</p>

<p>Option &quot;NoAccel&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Disable
or enable acceleration. Default: acceleration is
enabled.</p>

<p>Option &quot;AccelMethod&quot; &quot;string&quot;
Chooses between available acceleration architectures. Valid
options are XAA and EXA. XAA is the traditional acceleration
architecture and support for it is very stable. EXA is a
newer acceleration architecture with better performance for
the Render and Composite extensions, but the rendering code
for it is newer and possibly unstable. The default is
XAA.</p>

<p>Option &quot;NoHal&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Disable or
enable loading the &quot;mga_hal&quot; module. Default: the
module is loaded when available and when using hardware that
it supports.</p>

<p>Option &quot;OverclockMem&quot; Set clocks to values
used by some commercial X Servers (G100, G200 and G400
only). Default: off.</p>

<p>Option &quot;PciRetry&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Enable
or disable PCI retries. Default: off.</p>

<p>Option &quot;Rotate&quot; &quot;CW&quot;</p>

<p>Option &quot;Rotate&quot; &quot;CCW&quot; Rotate the
display clockwise or counterclockwise. This mode is
unaccelerated. Default: no rotation.</p>

<p>Option &quot;ShadowFB&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Enable
or disable use of the shadow framebuffer layer. Default:
off.</p>

<p>Option &quot;SyncOnGreen&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
Enable or disable combining the sync signals with the green
sig- nal. Default: off.</p>

<p>Option &quot;UseFBDev&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Enable
or disable use of on OS-specific fb interface (and is not
supported on all OSs). See fbdevhw(4) for further
information. Default: off.</p>

<p>Option &quot;VideoKey&quot; &quot;integer&quot; This
sets the default pixel value for the YUV video overlay key.
Default: undefined.</p>

<p>Option &quot;TexturedVideo&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
This has XvImage support use the texture engine rather than
the video overlay. This option is only supported by G200 and
later chips, and only at 16 and 32 bits per pixel. Default:
off.</p>

<p>Option &quot;OldDmaInit&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; This
forces the driver to use the old DMA initialization path for
DRI. Use this option only to support a older version of the
DRI driver with a newer DRM (version 3.2 or later). This
option also disables the use of direct rendering on PCI
cards. Default: off.</p>

<p>Option &quot;ForcePciDma&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; This
forces the use of PCI DMA even if AGP DMA could be used.
This option is primarily intended for testing purposes, but
it could also be used on systems with a buggy or poorly
function AGP implementation. Default: off.</p>
