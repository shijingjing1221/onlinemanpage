<p>NAME glutStrokeWidth - Returns the width in pixels of a
character in a given font.</p>

<p>LIBRARY OpenGLUT - fonts</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;openglut.h&gt;</p>

<p>float glutStrokeWidth(void *fontID, int character);</p>

<p>PARAMETERS fontID A GLUT stroked font identifier.</p>

<p>character A character code.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This function reports how far the model
space origin will advance if you putput this character in
the font named by fontID. Not all letters will use their
full width, especially in fixed-width fonts.</p>

<p>Returns 0 if character is out of range or if the fontID
is invalid.</p>

<p>CAVEATS Historically, this function has been described
as returning a pixel- width, but was implemented to return
the width in model-space units, rounded to integers. GLUT
never resolved this, and freeglut duplicated the confusion.
OpenGLUT has decided to stay in model-space and to return
the unrounded floating point value. An unreleased GLUT 3.8
was supposed to include glutStrokeWidthf() and
glutStrokeLengthf() (note the *f suf- fixes), but that is
not in wide use.</p>

<p>TODO Determine if any glyphs are either wider than this
function or if they render outside of the bounding box given
by (0,-descent) by (width,height-descent) .</p>
