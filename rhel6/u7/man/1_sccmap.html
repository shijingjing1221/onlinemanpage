<p>NAME sccmap - extract strongly connected components of
directed graphs</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sccmap [-dsv] [ -ooutfile ] [ files ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION sccmap decomposes digraphs into strongly
connected components and an auxiliary map of the
relationship between components. In this map, each component
is collapsed into a node. The resulting graphs are printed
to standard out. The number of nodes, edges and strongly
con- nected components are printed to standard error. sccmap
is a way of partitioning large graphs into more manageable
pieces.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The following options are supported:</p>

<p>-d Preserve degenerate components of only one node.</p>

<p>-s Do not print the resulting graphs. Only the
statistics are important.</p>

<p>-S Just print the resulting graphs. No statistics are
printed.</p>

<p>-ooutput Prints output to the file output. If not given,
sccmap uses std- out.</p>

<p>-v Generate additional statistics. In particular, sccmap
prints the number of nodes, edges, connected components, and
strongly con- nected components, followed by the fraction of
nodes in a non- trivial strongly connected components, the
maximum degree of the graph, and fraction of non-tree edges
in the graph.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operand is supported:</p>

<p>files Names of files containing 1 or more graphs in dot
format. If no files operand is specified, the standard input
will be used.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS sccmap emits a warning if it encounters an
undirected graph, and ignores it.</p>
