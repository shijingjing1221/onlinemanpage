<p>NAME hpftodit - create font description files for use
with groff -Tlj4</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS hpftodit [ -sv ] [ -in ] tfm_file map_file
font</p>

<p>It is possible to have whitespace between the -i command
line option and its parameter.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION hpftodit creates a font file for use with
groff -Tlj4 from an HP tagged font metric file. tfm_file is
the name of the tagged font metric file for the font.
map_file is a file giving the groff names for characters in
the font; this file should consist of a sequence of lines of
the form:</p>

<p>n c1 c2 ...</p>

<p>where n is a decimal integer giving the MSL number of
the character, and c1, c2,... are the groff names of the
character. font is the name of the groff font file. The
groff font file is written to font.</p>

<p>The -s option should be given if the font is special (a
font is special if troff should search it whenever a
character is not found in the cur- rent font.) If the font
is special, it should be listed in the fonts command in the
DESC file; if it is not special, there is no need to list
it, since troff can automatically mount it when its first
used.</p>

<p>If the -i option is used, hpftodit will automatically
generate an italic correction, a left italic correction and
a subscript correction for each character (the significance
of these parameters is explained in groff_font(5)).</p>

<p>OPTIONS -v Print the version number.</p>

<p>-s The font is special. The effect of this option is to
add the special command to the font file.</p>

<p>-in Generate an italic correction for each character so
that the character s width plus the characters italic
correction is equal to n design units plus the amount by
which the right edge of the characters bounding is to the
right of the characters origin. If this would result in a
negative italic correction, use a zero italic correction
instead. There are 8782 design units per em for Intellifont
fonts.</p>

<p>Also generate a subscript correction equal to the
product of the tangent of the slant of the font and four
fifths of the x-height of the font. If this would result in
a subscript correction greater than the italic correction,
use a subscript correction equal to the italic correction
instead.</p>

<p>Also generate a left italic correction for each
character equal to n design units plus the amount by which
the left edge of the characters bounding box is to the left
of the characters ori- gin. The left italic correction may
be negative.</p>

<p>This option is normally needed only with italic (or
oblique) fonts.</p>

<p>BUGS This program was written without the benefit of
complete, official doc- umentation on the tagged font metric
format. It is therefore likely that it will fail to work on
tfm files that are dissimilar to those for the internal
fonts on the Laserjet 4, with which it was tested:</p>

<p>TrueType tfm files are not supported.</p>
