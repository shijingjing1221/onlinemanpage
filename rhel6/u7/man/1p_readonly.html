<p>READONLY(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual READONLY(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME readonly - set the readonly attribute for
variables</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS readonly name[=word]...</p>

<p>readonly -p</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The variables whose names are specified
shall be given the readonly attribute. The values of
variables with the readonly attribute cannot be changed by
subsequent assignment, nor can those variables be unset by
the unset utility. If the name of a variable is followed by
= word, then the value of that variable shall be set to
word.</p>

<p>The readonly special built-in shall support the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>When -p is specified, readonly writes to the standard
output the names and values of all read-only variables, in
the following format:</p>

<p>&quot;readonly %s=%n&quot;, &lt;name&gt;,
&lt;value&gt;</p>

<p>if name is set, and</p>

<p>&quot;readonly %n&quot;, &lt;name&gt;</p>

<p>if name is unset.</p>

<p>The shell shall format the output, including the proper
use of quoting, so that it is suitable for reinput to the
shell as commands that achieve the same value and readonly
attribute-setting results in a shell execution environment
in which:</p>

<p>1. Variables with values at the time they were output do
not have the readonly attribute set.</p>

<p>2. Variables that were unset at the time they were
output do not have a value at the time at which the saved
output is reinput to the shell.</p>

<p>When no arguments are given, the results are
unspecified.</p>

<p>OPTIONS See the DESCRIPTION.</p>

<p>OPERANDS See the DESCRIPTION.</p>

<p>STDIN Not used.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES None.</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT See the DESCRIPTION.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS Zero.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES readonly HOME PWD</p>

<p>RATIONALE Some historical shells preserve the readonly
attribute across separate invocations. This volume of IEEE
Std 1003.1-2001 allows this behavior, but does not require
it.</p>

<p>The -p option allows portable access to the values that
can be saved and then later restored using, for example, a
dot script. Also see the RATIONALE for export for a
description of the no-argument and -p output cases and a
related example.</p>

<p>Read-only functions were considered, but they were
omitted as not being historical practice or particularly
useful. Furthermore, functions must not be read-only across
invocations to preclude spoofing (spoofing is the term for
the practice of creating a program that acts like a
well-known utility with the intent of subverting the real
intent of the user) of administrative or security-relevant
(or security-conscious) shell scripts.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
