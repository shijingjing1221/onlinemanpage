<p>PERL591DELTA(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERL591DELTA(1)</p>

<p>NAME perl591delta - what is new for perl v5.9.1</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This document describes differences between
the 5.9.0 and the 5.9.1 development releases. See
perl590delta for the differences between 5.8.0 and
5.9.0.</p>

<p>Incompatible Changes substr() lvalues are no longer
fixed-length The lvalues returned by the three argument form
of substr() used to be a &quot;fixed length window&quot; on
the original string. In some cases this could cause
surprising action at distance or other undefined behaviour.
Now the length of the window adjusts itself to the length of
the string assigned to it.</p>

<p>The &quot;:unique&quot; attribute is only meaningful for
globals Now applying &quot;:unique&quot; to lexical
variables and to subroutines will result in a compilation
error.</p>

<p>Core Enhancements Lexical $_ The default variable $_ can
now be lexicalized, by declaring it like any other lexical
variable, with a simple</p>

<p>my $_;</p>

<p>The operations that default on $_ will use the
lexically-scoped version of $_ when it exists, instead of
the global $_.</p>

<p>In a &quot;map&quot; or a &quot;grep&quot; block, if $_
was previously myed, then the $_ inside the block is lexical
as well (and scoped to the block).</p>

<p>In a scope where $_ has been lexicalized, you can still
have access to the global version of $_ by using $::_, or,
more simply, by overriding the lexical declaration with
&quot;our $_&quot;.</p>

<p>Tied hashes in scalar context As of perl 5.8.2/5.9.0,
tied hashes did not return anything useful in scalar
context, for example when used as boolean tests:</p>

<p>if (%tied_hash) { ... }</p>

<p>The old nonsensical behaviour was always to return
false, regardless of whether the hash is empty or has
elements.</p>

<p>There is now an interface for the implementors of tied
hashes to implement the behaviour of a hash in scalar
context, via the SCALAR method (see perltie). Without a
SCALAR method, perl will try to guess whether the hash is
empty, by testing if it s inside an iteration (in this case
it cant be empty) or by calling FIRSTKEY.</p>

<p>Formats Formats were improved in several ways. A new
field, &quot;^*&quot;, can be used for variable-width,
one-line-at-a-time text. Null characters are now handled
correctly in picture lines. Using &quot;@#&quot; and
&quot;~~&quot; together will now produce a compile-time
error, as those format fields are incompatible. perlform has
been improved, and miscellaneous bugs fixed.</p>

<p>Stacked filetest operators As a new form of syntactic
sugar, it s now possible to stack up filetest operators. You
can now write &quot;-f -w -x $file&quot; in a row to mean
&quot;-x $file &amp;&amp; -w _ &amp;&amp; -f _&quot;. See
&quot;-X&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p>Modules and Pragmata Benchmark In &quot;Benchmark&quot;,
cmpthese() and timestr() now use the time statistics of
children instead of parent when the selected style is
nop.</p>

<p>Carp The error messages produced by &quot;Carp&quot; now
include spaces between the arguments in function argument
lists: this makes long error messages appear more nicely in
browsers and other tools.</p>

<p>Exporter &quot;Exporter&quot; will now recognize
grouping tags (such as &quot;:name&quot;) anywhere in the
import list, not only at the beginning.</p>

<p>FindBin A function &quot;again&quot; is provided to
resolve problems where modules in different directories wish
to use FindBin.</p>

<p>List::Util You can now weaken references to read only
values.</p>

<p>threads::shared &quot;cond_wait&quot; has a new two
argument form. &quot;cond_timedwait&quot; has been
added.</p>

<p>Utility Changes &quot;find2perl&quot; now assumes
&quot;-print&quot; as a default action. Previously, it
needed to be specified explicitly.</p>

<p>A new utility, &quot;prove&quot;, makes it easy to run
an individual regression test at the command line.
&quot;prove&quot; is part of Test::Harness, which users of
earlier Perl versions can install from CPAN.</p>

<p>The perl debugger now supports a &quot;save&quot;
command, to save the current history to a file, and an
&quot;i&quot; command, which prints the inheritance tree of
its argument (if the &quot;Class::ISA&quot; module is
installed.)</p>

<p>Documentation The documentation has been revised in
places to produce more standard manpages.</p>

<p>The long-existing feature of &quot;/(?{...})/&quot;
regexps setting $_ and pos() is now documented.</p>

<p>Performance Enhancements Sorting arrays in place
(&quot;@a = sort @a&quot;) is now optimized to avoid making
a temporary copy of the array.</p>

<p>The operations involving case mapping on UTF-8 strings
(uc(), lc(), &quot;//i&quot;, etc.) have been greatly
speeded up.</p>

<p>Access to elements of lexical arrays via a numeric
constant between 0 and 255 is now faster. (This used to be
only the case for global arrays.)</p>

<p>Selected Bug Fixes UTF-8 bugs Using substr() on a UTF-8
string could cause subsequent accesses on that string to
return garbage. This was due to incorrect UTF-8 offsets
being cached, and is now fixed.</p>

<p>join() could return garbage when the same join()
statement was used to process 8 bit data having earlier
processed UTF-8 data, due to the flags on that statement s
temporary workspace not being reset correctly. This is now
fixed.</p>

<p>Using Unicode keys with tied hashes should now work
correctly.</p>

<p>chop() and chomp() used to mangle UTF-8 strings. This
has been fixed.</p>

<p>sprintf() used to misbehave when the format string was
in UTF-8. This is now fixed.</p>

<p>Threading bugs Hashes with the &quot;:unique&quot;
attribute werent made read-only in new threads. They are
now.</p>

<p>More bugs &quot;$a .. $b&quot; will now work as expected
when either $a or $b is &quot;undef&quot;.</p>

<p>Reading $^E now preserves $!. Previously, the C code
implementing $^E did not preserve &quot;errno&quot;, so
reading $^E could cause &quot;errno&quot; and therefore $!
to change unexpectedly.</p>

<p>&quot;strict&quot; wasn t in effect in regexp-eval
blocks (&quot;/(?{...})/&quot;).</p>

<p>New or Changed Diagnostics A new deprecation warning,
Deprecated use of my() in false conditional, has been added,
to warn against the use of the dubious and deprecated
construct</p>

<p>my $x if 0;</p>

<p>See perldiag.</p>

<p>The fatal error DESTROY created new reference to dead
object is now documented in perldiag.</p>

<p>A new error, %ENV is aliased to %s, is produced when
taint checks are enabled and when *ENV has been aliased (and
thus doesn t reflect the programs environment anymore.)</p>

<p>Changed Internals These news matter to you only if you
either write XS code or like to know about or hack Perl
internals (using Devel::Peek or any of the &quot;B::&quot;
modules counts), or like to run Perl with the &quot;-D&quot;
option.</p>

<p>Reordering of SVt_* constants The relative ordering of
constants that define the various types of &quot;SV&quot;
have changed; in particular, &quot;SVt_PVGV&quot; has been
moved before &quot;SVt_PVLV&quot;, &quot;SVt_PVAV&quot;,
&quot;SVt_PVHV&quot; and &quot;SVt_PVCV&quot;. This is
unlikely to make any difference unless you have code that
explicitly makes assumptions about that ordering. (The
inheritance hierarchy of &quot;B::*&quot; objects has been
changed to reflect this.)</p>

<p>Removal of CPP symbols The C preprocessor symbols
&quot;PERL_PM_APIVERSION&quot; and
&quot;PERL_XS_APIVERSION&quot;, which were supposed to give
the version number of the oldest perl binary-compatible
(resp. source-compatible) with the present one, were not
used, and sometimes had misleading values. They have been
removed.</p>

<p>Less space is used by ops The &quot;BASEOP&quot;
structure now uses less space. The &quot;op_seq&quot; field
has been removed and replaced by two one-bit fields,
&quot;op_opt&quot; and &quot;op_static&quot;.
&quot;opt_type&quot; is now 9 bits long. (Consequently, the
&quot;B::OP&quot; class doesnt provide an &quot;seq&quot;
method anymore.)</p>

<p>New parser perl s parser is now generated by bison (it
used to be generated by byacc.) As a result, it seems to be
a bit more robust.</p>

<p>Configuration and Building &quot;Configure&quot; now
invokes callbacks regardless of the value of the variable
they are called for. Previously callbacks were only invoked
in the &quot;case $variable $define)&quot; branch. This
change should only affect platform maintainers writing
configuration hints files.</p>

<p>The portability and cleanliness of the Win32 makefiles
has been improved.</p>

<p>Known Problems There are still a couple of problems in
the implementation of the lexical $_: it doesnt work inside
&quot;/(?{...})/&quot; blocks and with regard to the
reverse() built-in used without arguments. (See the TODO
tests in t/op/mydef.t.)</p>

<p>Platform Specific Problems The test
ext/IPC/SysV/t/ipcsysv.t may fail on OpenBSD. This hasnt
been diagnosed yet.</p>

<p>On some configurations on AIX 5, one test in
lib/Time/Local.t fails. When configured with long doubles,
perl may fail tests 224-236 in t/op/pow.t on the same
platform.</p>

<p>For threaded builds, ext/threads/shared/t/wait.t has
been reported to fail some tests on HP-UX 10.20.</p>

<p>To-do for perl 5.10.0 This is a non-exhaustive,
non-ordered, non-contractual and non- definitive list of
things to do (or nice to have) for perl 5.10.0 :</p>

<p>Clean up and finish support for assertions. See
assertions.</p>

<p>Reimplement the mechanism of lexical pragmas to be more
extensible. Fix current pragmas that don t work well (or at
all) with lexical scopes or in run-time eval(STRING)
(&quot;sort&quot;, &quot;re&quot;, &quot;encoding&quot; for
example). MJD has a preliminary patch that implements
this.</p>

<p>Fix (or rewrite) the implementation of the
&quot;/(?{...})/&quot; closures.</p>

<p>Conversions from byte strings to UTF-8 currently map
high bit characters to Unicode without translation (or,
depending on how you look at it, by implicitly assuming that
the byte strings are in Latin-1). As perl assumes the C
locale by default, upgrading a string to UTF-8 may change
the meaning of its contents regarding character classes,
case mapping, etc. This should probably emit a warning (at
least).</p>

<p>Introduce a new special block, UNITCHECK, which is run
at the end of a compilation unit (module, file, eval(STRING)
block). This will correspond to the Perl 6 CHECK. Perl 5s
CHECK cannot be changed or removed because the O.pm/B.pm
backend framework depends on it.</p>

<p>Study the possibility of adding a new prototype
character, &quot;_&quot;, meaning &quot;this argument
defaults to $_&quot;.</p>

<p>Make the peephole optimizer optional.</p>

<p>Allow lexical aliases (maybe via the syntax &quot;my
lias = oo&quot;.</p>

<p>Fix the bugs revealed by running the test suite with the
&quot;-t&quot; switch (via &quot;make
test.taintwarn&quot;).</p>

<p>Make threads more robust.</p>

<p>Make &quot;no 6&quot; and &quot;no v6&quot; work
(opposite of &quot;use 5.005&quot;, etc.).</p>

<p>A test suite for the B module would be nice.</p>

<p>A ponie.</p>

<p>Reporting Bugs If you find what you think is a bug, you
might check the articles recently posted to the
comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
http://bugs.perl.org/ . There may also be information at
http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.</p>

<p>If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run
the perlbug program included with your release. Be sure to
trim your bug down to a tiny but sufficient test case. Your
bug report, along with the output of &quot;perl -V&quot;,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the
Perl porting team.</p>
