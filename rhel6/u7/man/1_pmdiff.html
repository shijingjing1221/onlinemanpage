<p>PMDIFF(1) PMDIFF(1)</p>

<p>NAME pmdiff - compares archives and report significant
differences</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pmdiff [-d/--keep] [-z/--hostzone]
[-p/--precision precision] [-q/--threshold thres]
[-S/--start starttime] [-T/--finish endtime] [-B/--begin
starttime] [-E/--end endtime] [-x metric] [-X file]
[--skip-excluded] [--skip-missing] [-Z/--timezone timezone]
archive1 [archive2]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pmdiff compares the average values for every
metric in either one or two archives, in a given time
window, for changes that are likely to be of interest when
searching for performance regressions.</p>

<p>The archive log has the base name archive and must have
been previously created using pmlogger(1). The
pmlogsummary(1) utility is used to obtain the average values
used for comparison.</p>

<p>There are two sorts of invocation of the tool: with
either one or two archives.</p>

<p>In the first case, the only sensible command line
requires use of all four time window arguments. These are
specified using the same time window format described in
PCPIntro(1), and are -S/--start and -T/--finish for the
start and end times of the first time window of interest in
the archive, and -B/--before and -E/--end for the start and
end times of the second time window of interest.</p>

<p>In the second case, with two archives, the -B/--before
and -E/--end options might be unnecessary. This might be the
case, for example, when comparing the same time window of
two consecutive days (usually two separate archives), or a
time window on the same day of different weeks.</p>

<p>In either case, pmdiff produces a sorted summary of
those metrics in the specified window whose values have
deviated the most from a minimal threshold. The level of
deviation is calculated by dividing the aver- age value of
each metric in both logs, and then calculating whether the
ratio falls outside of a range considered normal. This ratio
can be adjusted using the -q/--threshold option, and by
default it is 2 (i.e. report all metrics with average values
that have more than doubled in the two time windows or more
than halved in the two time windows).</p>

<p>If the baseline value is zero and the comparison value
is non-zero, the ratio is reported as |+| (infinitely
large). If the comparison value is zero and the baseline
value is non-zero, the ratio is reported as |-| (infinitely
small).</p>

<p>Reported metrics are sorted in ascending ratio
order.</p>

<p>Should any metrics be present in one window but missing
from the other, a diagnostic will be displayed listing each
missing metric and the archive from which it was
missing.</p>

<p>The remaining options control the specific information
to be reported. Metrics with counter semantics are converted
to rates before being evaluated.</p>

<p>-p/--precision Print all floating point numbers with
precision digits after the decimal place.</p>

<p>--skip-excluded Cull the list of names of metrics being
excluded from the output.</p>

<p>--skip-missing By default, pmdiff will report the names
of any metrics that are in one archive but not the other.
This option suppresses that reporting.</p>

<p>-x Compare each metric in each archive in the time
windows specified to a given egrep(1) pattern, excluding
those that match from the report output.</p>

<p>-X Allows a file to be specified which containing
egrep(1) patterns which are applied to the metric names to
optionally exclude some from the report.</p>

<p>-z Use the local timezone from the given archives.</p>

<p>-Z/--timezone Changes the timezone in the archive labels
to timezone in the for- mat of the environment variable TZ
as described in environ(5).</p>

<p>FILES $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmlogger/hostname Default directory
for PCP archives containing performance metric values
collected from the host hostname.</p>

<p>PCP ENVIRONMENT Environment variables with the prefix
PCP_ are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP. On each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in pcp.conf(5).</p>
