<p>NAME setxkbmap - set the keyboard using the X Keyboard
Extension</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS setxkbmap [ args ] [ layout [ variant [ option
... ] ] ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The setxkbmap command maps the keyboard to
use the layout determined by the options specified on the
command line.</p>

<p>An XKB keymap is constructed from a number of components
which are com- piled only as needed. The source for all of
the components can be found in /usr/share/X11/xkb.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -help Prints a message describing the valid
input to setxkbmap.</p>

<p>-compat name Specifies the name of the compatibility map
component used to construct a keyboard layout.</p>

<p>-config file Specifies the name of an XKB configuration
file which describes the keyboard to be used.</p>

<p>-device device Specifies the numeric device id of the
input device to be updated with the new keyboard layout. If
not specified, the core keyboard device of the X server is
updated.</p>

<p>-display display Specifies the display to be updated
with the new keyboard lay- out.</p>

<p>-geometry name Specifies the name of the geometry
component used to construct a keyboard layout.</p>

<p>-I directory Adds a directory to the list of directories
to be used to search for specified layout or rules
files.</p>

<p>-keycodes name Specifies the name of the keycodes
component used to construct a keyboard layout.</p>

<p>-keymap name Specifies the name of the keymap
description used to construct a keyboard layout.</p>

<p>-layout name Specifies the name of the layout used to
determine the compo- nents which make up the keyboard
description. The -layout option may only be used once.
Multiple layouts can be specified as a comma-separated
list.</p>

<p>-model name Specifies the name of the keyboard model
used to determine the components which make up the keyboard
description. Only one model may be specified on the command
line.</p>

<p>-option name Specifies the name of an option to
determine the components which make up the keyboard
description; multiple options may be specified, one per
-option flag. Note that setxkbmap adds options specified in
the command line to the options that were set before (as
saved in root window properties). If you want to replace all
previously specified options, use the -option flag with an
empty argument first.</p>

<p>-print With this option setxkbmap just prints component
names in a format acceptable by xkbcomp (an XKB keymap
compiler) and exits. The option can be used for tests
instead of a verbose option and in cases when one needs to
run both the setxkbmap and the xkbcomp in chain (see
below).</p>

<p>-query With this option setxkbmap just prints the
current rules, model, layout, variant, and options, then
exits.</p>

<p>-rules file Specifies the name of the rules file used to
resolve the requested layout and model to a set of component
names.</p>

<p>-symbols name Specifies the name of the symbols
component used to construct a keyboard layout.</p>

<p>-synch Force synchronization for X requests.</p>

<p>-types name Specifies the name of the types component
used to construct a keyboard layout.</p>

<p>-variant name Specifies which variant of the keyboard
layout should be used to determine the components which make
up the keyboard descrip- tion. The -variant option may only
be used once. Multiple vari- ants can be specified as a
comma-separated list and will be matched with the layouts
specified with -layout.</p>

<p>-verbose|-v [level] Specifies level of verbosity in
output messages. Valid levels range from 0 (least verbose)
to 10 (most verbose). The default verbosity level is 5. If
no level is specified, each -v or -verbose flag raises the
level by 1.</p>

<p>USING WITH xkbcomp If you have an Xserver and a client
shell running on different comput- ers and XKB configuration
files on those machines are different you can get problems
specifying a keyboard map by model, layout, options names.
This is because setxkbcomp converts these names to names of
XKB config- uration files according to files that are on the
client side computer, then it sends the file names to the
server where the xkbcomp has to compose a complete keyboard
map using files which the server has. Thus if the sets of
files differ significantly the names that the setxkbmap
generates can be unacceptable on the server side. You can
solve this problem by running the xkbcomp on the client side
too. With the -print option setxkbmap just prints the file
names in an appropriate format to its stdout and this output
can be piped directly to the xkbcomp input. For example, the
command</p>

<p>setxkbmap us -print | xkbcomp - $DISPLAY</p>

<p>makes both steps run on the same (client) machine and
loads a keyboard map into the server.</p>
