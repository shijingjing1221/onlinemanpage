<p>NAME XmPrintSetup setup and create a Print Shell
widget</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;Xm/Print.h&gt; Widget
XmPrintSetup( Widget video_widget, Screen *print_screen,
String print_shell_name, ArgList args, Cardinal
num_args);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION A function that does the appropriate setting
and creates a realized XmPrintShell that it returns to the
caller. This function hides the details of the Xt to set up
a valid print shell heirarchy for the application. It is
also meant to encourage consistency in the way applications
root their print widget hierarchy.</p>

<p>print_screen must belong to a Display connection that
has already been initialized with Xt.</p>

<p>The video_widget is used to get at the application
context, application name and class, and argc/argv stored on
the applicationShell that roots this widget. If no
applicationShell is found, NULL argv/argc are used.</p>

<p>XmPrintSetup then creates an unrealized ApplicationShell
with the same name and class as the one given by the video
display, on the print dis- play and on the print screen
specified.</p>

<p>An XmPrintShell is then created as a child of this
toplevel shell, using XtCreatePopupShell, with the name
print_shell_name, and using the args provided. It then
realizes and maps the print shell, using XtPopup with
XtGrabNone.</p>

<p>This way, application resource files and users can
specify print spe- cific attributes using the following
syntax (if print_shell_name is &quot;Print&quot;):</p>

<p>Dtpad.Print*textFontList: somefont
*Print*background:white *Print*highlightThickness:0</p>

<p>video_widget A video widget to fetch app video data
from.</p>

<p>print_screen A print screen on the print display -
specifies the screen onto which the new shell is
created.</p>

<p>print_shell_name Specifies the name of the XmPrintShell
created on the X Print server.</p>

<p>args Specifies the argument list from which to get the
resources for the XmPrintShell.</p>

<p>num_args Specifies the number of arguments in the
argument list.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The id the XmPrintShell widget created on
the X Print Server connec- tion, or NULL if an error has
occured.</p>

<p>ERRORS/WARNINGS None.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES From the OK callback and the SetUp callback of
the primary print dialog widget:</p>

<p>static void printOKCB(Widget, XtPointer call_data,
XtPointer client_data) { AppPrint *p = (AppPrint *)
client_data; DtPrintSetupCallbackStruct *pbs =
(XmPrintCallbackStruct *) call_data;</p>

<p>/* connect if not already done. the print dialog
callback always provides valid printer name, print display
and screen already initialized: XpInitContext called */ */
p-&gt;print_shell = XmPrintSetup (widget,
pbs-&gt;print_screen, &quot;Print&quot;, NULL, 0);</p>

<p>... }</p>
