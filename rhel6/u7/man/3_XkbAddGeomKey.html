<p>XkbAddGeomKey(3) XKB FUNCTIONS XkbAddGeomKey(3)</p>

<p>NAME XkbAddGeomKey - Add one key at the end of an
existing row of keys</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS XkbKeyPtr XkbAddGeomKey (XkbRowPtr row);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS - row row to be updated</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Xkb provides functions to add a single new
element to the top-level keyboard geometry. In each case the
num_ * fields of the corresponding structure is incremented
by 1. These functions do not change sz_* unless there is no
more room in the array. Some of these functions fill in the
values of the element s structure from the arguments. For
other functions, you must explicitly write code to fill the
structures ele- ments.</p>

<p>The top-level geometry description includes a list of
geometry proper- ties. A geometry property associates an
arbitrary string with an equally arbitrary name. Programs
that display images of keyboards can use geometry properties
as hints, but they are not interpreted by Xkb. No other
geometry structures refer to geometry properties.</p>

<p>Keys are grouped into rows. XkbAddGeomKey adds one key
to the end of the specified row. The key is allocated and
zeroed. XkbAddGeomKey returns NULL if row is empty or if it
was not able to allocate space for the key. To allocate
space for an arbitrary number of keys to a row, use
XkbAllocGeomKeys.</p>

<p>STRUCTURES typedef struct _XkbKey { / key in a row */
XkbKeyNameRec name; / key name */ short gap; / gap in mm/10
from previous key in row */ unsigned char shape_ndx; / index
of shape for key */ unsigned char color_ndx; / index of
color for key body */ } XkbKeyRec, *XkbKeyPtr;</p>
