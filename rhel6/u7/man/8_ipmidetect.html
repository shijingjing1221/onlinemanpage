<p>NAME ipmidetect - list detected and/or undetected IPMI
interfaces in a clus- ter</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ipmidetect [OPTION...] [NODES...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION ipmidetect lists which IPMI nodes have been
detected or undetected in a cluster. This information is
provided by the libipmidetect(3) library and ipmidetectd(8)
daemon.</p>

<p>ipmidetect will output the status of each IPMI node
configured with ipmidetectd(8) unless they are specified on
the command line. If the first node listed is &quot;-&quot;,
nodes will be read in from standard input. The nodes can be
listed in hostrange format, comma separated lists, or space
separated lists. See the section below on HOSTRANGED SUPPORT
for instructions on how to list hosts in range format. The
hostnames listed must be the shortened names of
hostnames.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -?, --help Print help and exit</p>

<p>-V, --version Print version and exit</p>

<p>-o STRING, --hostname=STRING server hostname
(default=localhost)</p>

<p>-p INT, --port=INT server port (default=8649)</p>

<p>-d, --detected List only detected nodes</p>

<p>-u, --undetected List only undetected nodes</p>

<p>-q, --hostrange List nodes in hostrange format
(default)</p>

<p>-c, --comma List nodes in comma separated list</p>

<p>-n, --newline List nodes in newline separated list</p>

<p>-s, --space List nodes in space separated list</p>

<p>HOSTRANGED SUPPORT Multiple hosts can be input either as
an explicit comma separated lists of hosts or a range of
hostnames in the general form: prefix[n-m,l- k,...], where n
&lt; m and l &lt; k, etc. The later form should not be con-
fused with regular expression character classes (also
denoted by []). For example, foo[19] does not represent foo1
or foo9, but rather repre- sents a degenerate range:
foo19.</p>

<p>This range syntax is meant only as a convenience on
clusters with a prefixNN naming convention and specification
of ranges should not be considered necessary -- the list
foo1,foo9 could be specified as such, or by the range
foo[1,9].</p>

<p>Some examples of range usage follow: foo[01-05] instead
of foo01,foo02,foo03,foo04,foo05 foo[7,9-10] instead of
foo7,foo9,foo10 foo[0-3] instead of foo0,foo1,foo2,foo3</p>

<p>As a reminder to the reader, some shells will interpret
brackets ([ and ]) for pattern matching. Depending on your
shell, it may be necessary to enclose ranged lists within
quotes.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS The exit value of ipmidetect depends on the
options performed on the command line. If the default output
is used, the exit value will be 0 if the command succeeds
without error. If the --detected option is used and no
undetected nodes have been discovered, the exit value will
be 0. If undetected nodes are found, the exit value will be
1. If the --unde- tected option is used and no detected
nodes have been discovered, the exit value will be 0. If
detected nodes are found, the exit value will be 1. On
errors, the exit value will be 2.</p>
