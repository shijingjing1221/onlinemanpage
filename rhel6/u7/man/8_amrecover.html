<p>NAME amrecover - Amanda index database browser</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS amrecover [-C config] [-s index-server] [-t
tape-server] [-d tape-device] [-o configoption]...</p>

<p>amoldrecover [-C config] [-s index-server] [-t
tape-server] [-d tape-device]...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Amrecover browses the database of Amanda
index files to determine which tapes contain files to
recover. Furthermore, it is able to recover files.</p>

<p>In order to restore files in place, you must invoke
amrecover from the root of the backed up filesystem, or use
lcd to move into that directory, otherwise a directory tree
that resembles the backed up filesystem will be created in
the current directory. See the examples below for
details.</p>

<p>Amrecover will read the amanda-client.conf file and the
config/amanda-client.conf file. If no configuration name is
supplied on the command line, Amrecover will try the
compiled-in default configuration ,usually DailySet1.</p>

<p>Amanda 2.5.1 introduced a new recover protocol. Backup
communication works with any combination of versions, but
2.5.1&acute;s amrecover cannot communicate with an older
server. Use amoldrecover on 2.5.1 and higher clients when
communicating with an older server.</p>

<p>See the amanda(8) man page for more details about
Amanda.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Note The Default values are those set at
compile-time. Use amrestore to recover client-encrypted or
client-custom-compressed tapes.</p>

<p>[ -C ] config Amanda configuration.</p>

<p>-s index-server Host that runs the index daemon.</p>

<p>-t tape-server Host that runs the tape server
daemon.</p>

<p>-d tape-device Tape device to use on the tape server
host.</p>

<p>-o clientconfigoption See the &quot;CONFIGURATION
OVERRIDE&quot; section in amanda(8).</p>

<p>COMMANDS Amrecover connects to the index server and then
presents a command line prompt. Usage is similar to an ftp
client. The GNU readline library is used to provide command
line history and editing if it was built in to
amrecover.</p>

<p>The purpose of browsing the database is to build up a
restore list of files to be extracted from the backup
system. The following commands are available:</p>

<p>sethost hostname Specifies which host to look at backup
files for (default: the local host).</p>

<p>setdate YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM[-SS] | YYYY-MM-DD Set the
restore time (default: now). File listing commands only
return information on backup images for this day, for the
day before with the next lower dump level, and so on, until
the most recent level 0 backup on or before the specified
date is encountered.</p>

<p>For example, if:</p>

<p>1996-07-01 was a level 0 backup 1996-07-02 through
1996-07-05 were level 1 backups 1996-07-06 through
1997-07-08 were level 2 backups</p>

<p>then the command setdate 1997-07-08-00 would yield files
from the following days:</p>

<p>1997-07-08 (the latest level 2 backup) 1997-07-05 (the
latest level 1 backup) 1997-07-01 (the latest level 0
backup)</p>

<p>Only the most recent version of a file will be
presented.</p>

<p>The following abbreviated date specifications are
accepted:</p>

<p>--MM-DD dates in the current year</p>

<p>---DD dates in the current month of the current year</p>

<p>setdisk diskname [mountpoint] Specifies which disk to
consider (default: the disk holding the working directory
where amrecover is started). It can only be set after the
host is set with sethost. Diskname is the device name
specified in the amanda.conf or disklist(5). The disk must
be local to the host. If mountpoint is not specified, all
pathnames will be relative to the (unknown) mount point
instead of full pathnames.</p>

<p>listhost [diskdevice] List all host</p>

<p>listdisk [diskdevice] List all diskname</p>

<p>setdevice [[-h tape-server] tapedev] Specifies the host
to use as the tape server, and which of its tape devices to
use. If the server is omitted, the server name reverts to
the configure-time default. If the tape device is omitted,
the default is used.</p>

<p>If you want amrecover to use your changer, the tapedev
must be equal to the amrecover_changer setting on the
server.</p>

<p>Since device names contain colons, you must always
specify the hostname. settape 192.168.0.10:file:/file1 You
can change the tape device when amrecover ask you to load
the tape: Load tape DMP014 now Continue? [Y/n/t]: t Tape
device: server2:/dev/nst2 Continue? [Y/n/t]: Y Using tape
/dev/nst2 from server server2.</p>

<p>setmode mode Set the extraction mode for Samba shares.
If mode is smb, shares are sent to the Samba server to be
restored back onto the PC. If mode is tar, they are
extracted on the local machine the same way tar volumes are
extracted.</p>

<p>mode Displays the extracting mode for Samba shares.</p>

<p>history Show the backup history of the current host and
disk. Dates, levels, tapes and file position on tape of each
backup are displayed.</p>

<p>pwd Display the name of the current backup working
directory.</p>

<p>cd dir Change the backup working directory to dir. If
the mount point was specified with setdisk, this can be a
full pathname or it can be relative to the current backup
working directory. If the mount point was not specified,
paths are relative to the mount point if they start with
&quot;/&quot;, otherwise they are relative to the current
backup working directory. The dir can be a shell style
wildcards.</p>

<p>cdx dir Like the cd command but allow regular
expression.</p>

<p>lpwd Display the amrecover working directory. Files will
be restored under this directory, relative to the backed up
filesystem.</p>

<p>lcd path Change the amrecover working directory to
path.</p>

<p>ls List the contents of the current backup working
directory. See the description of the setdate command for
how the view of the directory is built up. The backup date
is shown for each file.</p>

<p>add item1 item2 ... Add the specified files or
directories to the restore list. Each item may have shell
style wildcards.</p>

<p>addx item1 item2 ... Add the specified files or
directories to the restore list. Each item may be a regular
expression.</p>

<p>delete item1 item2 ... Delete the specified files or
directories from the restore list. Each item may have shell
style wildcards.</p>

<p>deletex item1 item2 ... Delete the specified files or
directories from the restore list. Each item may be a
regular expression.</p>

<p>list file Display the contents of the restore list. If a
file name is specified, the restore list is written to that
file. This can be used to manually extract the files from
the Amanda tapes with amrestore.</p>

<p>clear Clear the restore list.</p>

<p>quit Close the connection to the index server and
exit.</p>

<p>exit Close the connection to the index server and
exit.</p>

<p>extract Start the extract sequence (see the examples
below). Make sure the local working directory is the root of
the backed up filesystem, or another directory that will
behave like that. Use lpwd to display the local working
directory, and lcd to change it.</p>

<p>help Display a brief list of these commands.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT PAGER The ls and list commands will use
$PAGER to display the file lists. Defaults to more if PAGER
is not set.</p>

<p>AMANDA_SERVER If set, $AMANDA_SERVER will be used as
index-server. The value will take precedence over the
compiled default, but will be overridden by the -s
switch.</p>

<p>AMANDA_TAPE_SERVER If set, $AMANDA_TAPE_SERVER will be
used as tape-server. The value will take precedence over the
compiled default, but will be overridden by the -t
switch.</p>
