<p>UNAME(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual UNAME(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME uname - get the name of the current system</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/utsname.h&gt;</p>

<p>int uname(struct utsname *name);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The uname() function shall store information
identifying the current system in the structure pointed to
by name.</p>

<p>The uname() function uses the utsname structure defined
in &lt;sys/utsname.h&gt;.</p>

<p>The uname() function shall return a string naming the
current system in the character array sysname. Similarly,
nodename shall contain the name of this node within an
implementation-defined communications network. The arrays
release and version shall further identify the operating
system. The array machine shall contain a name that
identifies the hardware that the system is running on.</p>

<p>The format of each member is implementation-defined.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, a non-negative
value shall be returned. Otherwise, -1 shall be returned and
errno set to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The inclusion of the nodename member
in this structure does not imply that it is sufficient
information for interfacing to communications networks.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The values of the structure members are not
constrained to have any relation to the version of this
volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 imple- mented in the
operating system. An application should instead depend on
_POSIX_VERSION and related constants defined in
&lt;unistd.h&gt;.</p>

<p>This volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 does not define the
sizes of the members of the structure and permits them to be
of different sizes, although most implementations define
them all to be the same size: eight bytes plus one byte for
the string terminator. That size for nodename is not enough
for use with many networks.</p>

<p>The uname() function originated in System III, System V,
and related implementations, and it does not exist in
Version 7 or 4.3 BSD. The values it returns are set at
system compile time in those historical implementations.</p>

<p>4.3 BSD has gethostname() and gethostid(), which return
a symbolic name and a numeric value, respectively. There are
related sethostname() and sethostid() functions that are
used to set the values the other two functions return. The
former functions are included in this specifica- tion, the
latter are not.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>

1003.1-2001, &lt;sys/utsname.h&gt;</p>
