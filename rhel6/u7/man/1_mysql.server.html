<p>NAME mysql.server - MySQL server startup script</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS mysql {start|stop}</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION MySQL distributions on Unix include a script
named mysql.server. It can be used on systems such as Linux
and Solaris that use System V-style run directories to start
and stop system services. It is also used by the Mac OS X
Startup Item for MySQL.</p>

<p>mysql.server can be found in the support-files directory
under your MySQL installation directory or in a MySQL source
distribution.</p>

<p>If you use the Linux server RPM package
(MySQL-server-VERSION.rpm), the mysql.server script will be
installed in the /etc/init.d directory with the name mysql.
You need not install it manually. See Section 2.5.1,
Installing MySQL on Linux Using RPM Packages , for more
information on the Linux RPM packages.</p>

<p>Some vendors provide RPM packages that install a startup
script under a different name such as mysqld.</p>

<p>If you install MySQL from a source distribution or using
a binary distribution format that does not install
mysql.server automatically, you can install it manually.
Instructions are provided in Section 2.12.1.2, Starting and
Stopping MySQL Automatically.</p>

<p>mysql.server reads options from the [mysql.server] and
[mysqld] sections of option files. For backward
compatibility, it also reads [mysql_server] sections,
although you should rename such sections to [mysql.server]
when using MySQL 5.1.</p>

<p>mysql.server supports the following options.</p>

<p>&middot; --basedir=path</p>

<p>The path to the MySQL installation directory.</p>

<p>&middot; --datadir=path</p>

<p>The path to the MySQL data directory.</p>

<p>&middot; --pid-file=file_name</p>

<p>The path name of the file in which the server should
write its process ID.</p>

<p>&middot; --service-startup-timeout=file_name</p>

<p>How long in seconds to wait for confirmation of server
startup. If the server does not start within this time,
mysql.server exits with an error. The default value is 900.
A value of 0 means not to wait at all for startup. Negative
values mean to wait forever (no timeout). This option was
added in MySQL 5.1.17. Before that, a value of 900 is always
used.</p>

<p>&middot; --use-mysqld_safe</p>

<p>Use mysqld_safe to start the server. This is the
default.</p>

<p>&middot; --use-manager</p>

<p>Use Instance Manager to start the server.</p>

<p>&middot; --user=user_name</p>

<p>The login user name to use for running mysqld.</p>
