<p>BCMP(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual BCMP(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME bcmp - memory operations (LEGACY)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;strings.h&gt;</p>

<p>int bcmp(const void *s1, const void *s2, size_t n);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The bcmp() function shall compare the first
n bytes of the area pointed to by s1 with the area pointed
to by s2.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The bcmp() function shall return 0 if s1
and s2 are identical; other- wise, it shall return non-zero.
Both areas are assumed to be n bytes long. If the value of n
is 0, bcmp() shall return 0.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The memcmp() function is preferred
over this function.</p>

<p>For maximum portability, it is recommended to replace
the function call to bcmp() as follows:</p>

<p>#define bcmp(b1,b2,len) memcmp((b1), (b2),
(size_t)(len))</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS This function may be withdrawn in a
future version.</p>

Std 1003.1-2001, &lt;strings.h&gt;</p>
