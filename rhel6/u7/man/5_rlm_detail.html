<p>rlm_detail(5) FreeRADIUS Module rlm_detail(5)</p>

<p>NAME rlm_detail - FreeRADIUS Module</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The rlm_detail module writes radius packets
to detail files. It is primarily used for storing accounting
information, but can be used in other sections to write
packet details as well.</p>

<p>The file format is similar to that of the old Livingston
servers, and many detail file parsers should work with
FreeRADIUS.</p>

<p>The main configuration items to be aware of are:</p>

<p>detailfile The file name in which to store the radius
packet records. NOTE: this variable is run through dynamic
string expansion, and can include FreeRADIUS variables to
create a dynamic filename.</p>

<p>%{radacctdir}/%{Client-IP-Address}/detail-%Y%m</p>

<p>This will create one file per month, for each client.
This accomplishes file rotation automatically from within
the server.</p>

<p>detailperm The file permissions of the detailfile. If
omitted, the default is 0600.</p>

<p>dirperm The directory permissions of the directory where
the detail files are created. The default is 0755.</p>

<p>locking This option is set to yes or no. By default it
is no. Set this to yes to enable file locking, which is used
with the radrelay program.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION modules { ... detail { detailfile =
%A/%{Client-IP-Address}/detail-%Y%m detailperm = 0600
dirperm = 0755 locking = no } ... } ... accounting { ...
