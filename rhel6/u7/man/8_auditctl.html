<p>AUDITCTL:(8) System Administration Utilities
AUDITCTL:(8)</p>

<p>NAME auditctl - a utility to assist controlling the
kernel s audit system</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS auditctl [options]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The auditctl program is used to control the
behavior, get status, and add or delete rules into the 2.6
kernels audit system.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -b backlog Set max number of outstanding audit
buffers allowed (Kernel Default=64) If all buffers are full,
the failure flag is con- sulted by the kernel for
action.</p>

<p>-e [0..2] Set enabled flag. When 0 is passed, this can
be used to tem- porarily disable auditing. When 1 is passed
as an argument, it will enable auditing. To lock the audit
configuration so that it can t be changed, pass a 2 as the
argument. Locking the configu- ration is intended to be the
last command in audit.rules for anyone wishing this feature
to be active. Any attempt to change the configuration in
this mode will be audited and denied. The configuration can
only be changed by rebooting the machine.</p>

<p>-f [0..2] Set failure flag 0=silent 1=printk 2=panic.
This option lets you determine how you want the kernel to
handle critical errors. Example conditions where this flag
is consulted includes: trans- mission errors to userspace
audit daemon, backlog limit exceeded, out of kernel memory,
and rate limit exceeded. The default value is 1. Secure
environments will probably want to set this to 2.</p>

<p>-h Help</p>

<p>-i Ignore errors when reading rules from a file. This
causes auditctl to always return a success exit code.</p>

<p>-c Continue loading rules in spite of an error. This
summarizes the results of loading the rules. The exit code
will not be success if any rule fails to load.</p>

<p>-C [f=f | f!=f] Build an inter-field comparison rule:
field, operation, field. You may pass multiple comparisons
on a single command line. Each one must start with -C. Each
inter-field equation is anded with each other as well as
equations starting with -F to trigger an audit record. There
are 2 operators supported - equal, and not equal. Valid
fields are:</p>

<p>auid, uid, euid, suid, fsuid, obj_uid; and gid, egid,
sgid, fsgid, obj_gid</p>

<p>The two groups of uid and gid cannot be mixed. But any
comparison within the group can be made. The obj_uid/gid
fields are collected from the object of the event such as a
file or directory.</p>

<p>-l List all rules 1 per line. Two more options may be
given to this command. You can give either a key option (-k)
to list rules that match a key or a (-i) to have a0 through
a3 interpretted to help determine the syscall argument
values are correct .</p>

<p>-k key Set a filter key on an audit rule. The filter key
is an arbi- trary string of text that can be up to 31 bytes
long. It can uniquely identify the audit records produced by
a rule. Typical use is for when you have several rules that
together satisfy a security requirement. The key value can
be searched on with ausearch so that no matter which rule
triggered the event, you can find its results. The key can
also be used on delete all (-D) and list rules (-l) to
select rules with a specific key. You may have more than one
key on a rule if you want to be able to search logged events
in multiple ways or if you have an aud- ispd plugin that
uses a key to aid its analysis.</p>

<p>-m text Send a user space message into the audit system.
This can only be done if you have CAP_AUDIT_WRITE capability
(normally the root user has this). The resulting event will
be the USER type.</p>

<p>-p [r|w|x|a] Describe the permission access type that a
file system watch will trigger on. r=read, w=write,
x=execute, a=attribute change. These permissions are not the
standard file permissions, but rather the kind of syscall
that would do this kind of thing. The read &amp; write
syscalls are omitted from this set since they would
overwhelm the logs. But rather for reads or writes, the open
flags are looked at to see what permission was
requested.</p>

<p>-q mount-point,subtree If you have an existing directory
watch and bind or move mount another subtree in the watched
subtree, you need to tell the kernel to make the subtree
being mounted equivalent to the directory being watched. If
the subtree is already mounted at the time the directory
watch is issued, the subtree is automati- cally tagged for
watching. Please note the comma separating the two values.
Omitting it will cause errors.</p>

<p>-r rate Set limit in messages/sec (0=none). If this rate
is non-zero and is exceeded, the failure flag is consulted
by the kernel for action. The default value is 0.</p>

<p>-R file Read rules from a file. The rules must be 1 per
line and in the order that they are to be executed in. The
rule file must be owned by root and not readable by other
users or it will be rejected. The rule file may have
comments embedded by starting the line with a # character.
Rules that are read from a file are identical to what you
would type on a command line except they are not preceded by
auditctl (since auditctl is the one executing the file) and
you would not use shell escaping since auditctl is reading
the file instead of bash.</p>

<p>-s Report the kernels audit subsystem status. It will
tell you the in-kernel values that can be set by -e, -f, -r,
and -b options. The pid value is the process number of the
audit daemon. Note that a pid of 0 indicates that the audit
daemon is not running. The lost entry will tell you how many
event records that have been discarded due to the kernel
audit queue overflowing. The backlog field tells how many
event records are currently queued waiting for auditd to
read them.</p>

<p>-t Trim the subtrees after a mount command.</p>

<p>-v Print the version of auditctl.</p>

<p>-a [list,action|action,list] Append rule to the end of
list with action. Please note the comma separating the two
values. Omitting it will cause errors. The fields may be in
either order. It could be list,action or action,list. The
following describes the valid list names:</p>

<p>task Add a rule to the per task list. This rule list is
used only at the time a task is created -- when fork() or
clone() are called by the parent task. When using this list,
you should only use fields that are known at task creation
time, such as the uid, gid, etc.</p>

<p>exit Add a rule to the syscall exit list. This list is
used upon exit from a system call to determine if an audit
event should be created.</p>

<p>user Add a rule to the user message filter list. This
list is used by the kernel to filter events origi- nating in
user space before relaying them to the audit daemon. It
should be noted that the only fields that are valid are:
uid, auid, gid, pid, subj_user, subj_role, subj_type,
subj_sen, subj_clr, and msgtype. All other fields will be
treated as non-matching. It should be understood that any
event originating from user space from a process that has
CAP_AUDIT_WRITE will be recorded into the audit trail. This
means that the most likely use for this filter is with rules
that have an action of never since nothing has to be done to
allow events to be recorded.</p>

<p>exclude Add a rule to the event type exclusion filter
list. This list is used to filter events that you do not
want to see. For example, if you do not want to see any avc
messages, you would using this list to record that. The
message type that you do not wish to see is given with the
msgtype field.</p>

<p>The following describes the valid actions for the
rule:</p>

<p>never No audit records will be generated. This can be
used to suppress event generation. In general, you want
suppressions at the top of the list instead of the bottom.
This is because the event triggers on the first matching
rule.</p>

<p>always Allocate an audit context, always fill it in at
syscall entry time, and always write out a record at syscall
exit time.</p>

<p>-A list,action Add rule to the beginning list with
action.</p>

<p>-d list,action Delete rule from list with action. The
rule is deleted only if it exactly matches syscall name(s)
and every field name and value.</p>

<p>-D Delete all rules and watches. This can take a key
option (-k), too.</p>

<p>-S [Syscall name or number|all] Any syscall name or
number may be used. The word all may also be used. If the
given syscall is made by a program, then start an audit
record. If a field rule is given and no syscall is
specified, it will default to all syscalls. You may also
specify multiple syscalls in the same rule by using multiple
-S options in the same rule. Doing so improves performance
since fewer rules need to be evaluated. If you are on a
bi-arch system, like x86_64, you should be aware that
auditctl simply takes the text, looks it up for the native
arch (in this case b64) and sends that rule to the kernel.
If there are no additional arch direc- tives, IT WILL APPLY
TO BOTH 32 &amp; 64 BIT SYSCALLS. This can have undesirable
effects since there is no guarantee that, for exam- ple, the
open syscall has the same number on both 32 and 64 bit
interfaces. You will likely want to control this and write 2
rules, one with arch equal to b32 and one with b64 to make
sure the kernel finds the events that you intend. See the
arch field discussion for more info.</p>

<p>-F [n=v | n!=v | n&lt;v | n&gt;v | n&lt;=v | n&gt;=v |
n&amp;v | n&amp;=v] Build a rule field: name, operation,
value. You may have up to 64 fields passed on a single
command line. Each one must start with -F. Each field
equation is anded with each other (as well as equations
starting with -C) to trigger an audit record. There are 8
operators supported - equal, not equal, less than, greater
than, less than or equal, and greater than or equal, bit
mask, and bit test respectively. Bit test will
&quot;and&quot; the values and check that they are equal,
bit mask just &quot;ands&quot; the values. Fields that take
a user ID may instead have the users name; the program will
convert the name to user ID. The same is true of group
names. Valid fields are:</p>

<p>a0, a1, a2, a3 Respectively, the first 4 arguments to a
syscall. Note that string arguments are not supported. This
is because the kernel is passed a pointer to the string.
Triggering on a pointer address value is not likely to work.
So, when using this, you should only use on numeric values.
This is most likely to be used on platforms that multiplex
socket or IPC oper- ations.</p>

<p>arch The CPU architecture of the syscall. The arch can
be found doing uname -m. If you do not know the arch of your
machine but you want to use the 32 bit syscall table and
your machine supports 32 bit, you can also use b32 for the
arch. The same applies to the 64 bit syscall table, you can
use b64. In this way, you can write rules that are somewhat
arch independent because the family type will be auto
detected. However, syscalls can be arch specific and what is
available on x86_64, may not be available on ppc. The arch
directive should precede the -S option so that auditctl
knows which internal table to use to look up the syscall
numbers.</p>

<p>auid The original ID the user logged in with. Its an
abbreviation of audit uid. Sometimes its referred to as
loginuid. Either the user account text or number may be
used.</p>

<p>devmajor Device Major Number</p>

<p>devminor Device Minor Number</p>

<p>dir Full Path of Directory to watch. This will place a
recursive watch on the directory and its whole sub- tree. It
can only be used on exit list. See &quot;-w&quot;.</p>

<p>egid Effective Group ID. May be numeric or the groups
name.</p>

<p>euid Effective User ID. May be numeric or the user
account name.</p>

<p>exit Exit value from a syscall. If the exit code is an
errno, you may use the text representation, too.</p>

<p>fsgid Filesystem Group ID. May be numeric or the groups
name.</p>

<p>fsuid Filesystem User ID. May be numeric or the user
account name.</p>

<p>filetype The target files type. Can be either file, dir,
socket, link, character, block, or fifo.</p>

<p>gid Group ID. May be numeric or the groups name.</p>

<p>inode Inode Number</p>

<p>key This is another way of setting a filter key. See
discussion above for -k option.</p>

<p>msgtype This is used to match the event s record type.
It should only be used on the exclude or user filter
lists.</p>

<p>obj_uid Objects UID</p>

<p>obj_gid Objects GID</p>

<p>obj_user Resources SE Linux User</p>

<p>obj_role Resources SE Linux Role</p>

<p>obj_type Resources SE Linux Type</p>

<p>obj_lev_low Resources SE Linux Low Level</p>

<p>obj_lev_high Resources SE Linux High Level</p>

<p>path Full Path of File to watch. It can only be used on
exit list.</p>

<p>perm Permission filter for file operations. See
&quot;-p&quot;. It can only be used on exit list. You can
use this without specifying a syscall and the kernel will
select the syscalls that satisfy the permissions being
requested.</p>

<p>pers OS Personality Number</p>

<p>pid Process ID</p>

<p>ppid Parents Process ID</p>

<p>subj_user Programs SE Linux User</p>

<p>subj_role Programs SE Linux Role</p>

<p>subj_type Programs SE Linux Type</p>

<p>subj_sen Programs SE Linux Sensitivity</p>

<p>subj_clr Programs SE Linux Clearance</p>

<p>sgid Saved Group ID. See getresgid(2) man page.</p>

<p>success If the exit value is &gt;= 0 this is true/yes
otherwise its false/no. When writing a rule, use a 1 for
true/yes and a 0 for false/no</p>

<p>suid Saved User ID. See getresuid(2) man page.</p>

<p>uid User ID. May be numeric or the user account
name.</p>

<p>-w path Insert a watch for the file system object at
path. You cannot insert a watch to the top level directory.
This is prohibited by the kernel. Wildcards are not
supported either and will generate a warning. The way that
watches work is by tracking the inode internally. If you
place a watch on a file, its the same as using the -F path
option on a syscall rule. If you place a watch on a
directory, its the same as using the -F dir option on a
syscall rule. The -w form of writing watches is for
backwards compatibility and the syscall based form is more
expressive. Unlike most syscall auditing rules, watches do
not impact per- formance based on the number of rules sent
to the kernel. The only valid options when using a watch are
the -p and -k. If you need to anything fancy like audit a
specific user accessing a file, then use the syscall
auditing form with the path or dir fields. See the EXAMPLES
section for an example of converting one form to
another.</p>

<p>-W path Remove a watch for the file system object at
path. The rule must match exactly. See -d discussion for
more info.</p>

<p>PERFORMANCE TIPS Syscall rules get evaluated for each
syscall for every program. If you have 10 syscall rules,
every program on your system will delay during a syscall
while the audit system evaluates each rule. Too many syscall
rules will hurt performance. Try to combine as many as you
can whenever the filter, action, key, and fields are
identical. For example:</p>

<p>auditctl -a always,exit -S open -F success=0 auditctl -a
always,exit -S truncate -F success=0</p>

<p>could be re-written as one rule:</p>

<p>auditctl -a always,exit -S open -S truncate -F
success=0</p>

<p>Also, try to use file system auditing wherever
practical. This improves performance. For example, if you
were wanting to capture all failed opens &amp; truncates
like above, but were only concerned about files in /etc and
didnt care about /usr or /sbin, its possible to use this
rule:</p>

<p>auditctl -a always,exit -S open -S truncate -F dir=/etc
-F success=0</p>

<p>This will be higher performance since the kernel will
not evaluate it each and every syscall. It will be handled
by the filesystem auditing code and only checked on
filesystem related syscalls.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES To see all syscalls made by a specific
program:</p>

<p>auditctl -a always,exit -S all -F pid=1005</p>

<p>To see files opened by a specific user:</p>

<p>auditctl -a always,exit -S open -F auid=510</p>

<p>To see unsuccessful open calls:</p>

<p>auditctl -a always,exit -S open -F success=0</p>

<p>To watch a file for changes (2 ways to express):</p>

<p>auditctl -w /etc/shadow -p wa auditctl -a always,exit -F
path=/etc/shadow -F perm=wa</p>

<p>To recursively watch a directory for changes (2 ways to
express):</p>

<p>auditctl -w /etc/ -p wa auditctl -a always,exit -F
dir=/etc/ -F perm=wa</p>

<p>To see if an admin is accessing other users files:</p>

<p>auditctl -a always,exit -F dir=/home/ -F uid=0 -C
auid!=obj_uid</p>
