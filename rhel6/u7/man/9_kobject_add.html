<p>KOBJECT_ADD(9) Driver Basics KOBJECT_ADD(9)</p>

<p>NAME kobject_add - the main kobject add function</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS int kobject_add(struct kobject * kobj, struct
kobject * parent, const char * fmt, ...);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS kobj the kobject to add</p>

<p>parent pointer to the parent of the kobject.</p>

<p>fmt format to name the kobject with.</p>

<p>... variable arguments</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The kobject name is set and added to the
kobject hierarchy in this function.</p>

<p>If parent is set, then the parent of the kobj will be
set to it. If parent is NULL, then the parent of the kobj
will be set to the kobject associted with the kset assigned
to this kobject. If no kset is assigned to the kobject, then
the kobject will be located in the root of the sysfs
tree.</p>

<p>If this function returns an error, kobject_put must be
called to properly clean up the memory associated with the
object. Under no instance should the kobject that is passed
to this function be directly freed with a call to kfree,
that can leak memory.</p>

<p>Note, no add uevent will be created with this call, the
caller should set up all of the necessary sysfs files for
the object and then call kobject_uevent with the UEVENT_ADD
parameter to ensure that userspace is properly notified of
this kobject&acute;s creation.</p>
