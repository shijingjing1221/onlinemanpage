<p>XkbChangeIndicators(3) XKB FUNCTIONS
XkbChangeIndicators(3)</p>

<p>NAME XkbChangeIndicators - Changes indicator maps or
state without passing the entire keyboard description</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS Bool XkbChangeIndicators (Display *dpy,
XkbDescPtr xkb, XkbIndicator- ChangesPtr changes, unsigned
int state);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS - dpy connection to the X server</p>

<p>- xkb keyboard description from which names are to be
taken.</p>

<p>- changes indicators to be updated on the server</p>

<p>- state new state of indicators listed in
changes-&gt;state_changes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The XkbIndicatorChangesRec identifies small
modifications to the indi- cator map. Use it with the
function XkbChangeIndicators to reduce the amount of traffic
sent to the server (see STRUCTURES).</p>

<p>The state_changes field is a mask that specifies the
indicators that have changed state, and map_changes is a
mask that specifies the indi- cators whose maps have
changed.</p>

<p>XkbChangeIndicators copies any maps specified by changes
from the key- board description, xkb, to the server
specified by dpy. If any bits are set in the state_changes
field of changes, XkbChangeIndicators also sets the state of
those indicators to the values specified in the state mask.
A 1 bit in state turns the corresponding indicator on, a 0
bit turns it off.</p>

<p>In addition, it can also generate
XkbIndicatorStateNotify and XkbIndi- catorMapNotify
events.</p>

<p>Whenever an indicator changes state, the server sends
XkbIndica- torStateNotify events to all interested clients.
Similarly, whenever an indicator s map changes, the server
sends XkbIndicatorMapNotify events to all interested
clients.</p>

<p>To receive XkbIndicatorStateNotify events, use
XkbSelectEvents with both the bits_to_change and
values_for_bits parameters containing
XkbIndicatorStateNotifyMask. To receive
XkbIndicatorMapNotify events, use XkbSelectEvents with
XkbIndicatorMapNotifyMask.</p>

<p>To receive events for only specific indicators, use
XkbSelectEventDe- tails. Set the event_type parameter to
XkbIndicatorStateNotify or XkbIndicatorMapNotify, and set
both the bits_to_change and val- ues_for_bits detail
parameters to a mask where each bit specifies one indicator,
turning on those bits that specify the indicators for which
you want to receive events.</p>

<p>xkb_type is either XkbIndicatorStateNotify or
XkbIndicatorMapNotify, depending on whether the event is a
kbIndicatorStateNotify event or kbIndicatorMapNotify
event.</p>

<p>The changed parameter is a mask that is the bitwise
inclusive OR of the indicators that have changed. If the
event is of type XkbIndicatorMap- Notify, changed reports
the maps that changed. If the event is of type
XkbIndicatorStateNotify, changed reports the indicators that
have changed state. state is a mask that specifies the
current state of all indicators, whether they have changed
or not, for both XkbIndica- torStateNotify and
IndicatorMapNotify events.</p>

<p>STRUCTURES typedef struct _XkbIndicatorChanges {
unsigned int state_changes; unsigned int map_changes;
}XkbIndicatorChangesRec,*XkbIndicatorChangesPtr;</p>

<p>Both types of indicator events use the same
structure:</p>

<p>typedef struct _XkbIndicatorNotify { int type; / Xkb
extension base event code */ unsigned long serial; / X
server serial number for event */ Bool send_event; / True
=&gt; synthetically generated */ Display * display; / server
connection where event generated */ Time time; / server time
when event generated */ int xkb_type; / specifies state or
map notify */ int device; / Xkb device ID, will not be
XkbUseCoreKbd*/ unsigned int changed; / mask of indicators
with new state or map */ unsigned int state; / current state
of all indicators */ } XkbIndicatorNotifyEvent;</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS BadAtom A name is neither a valid Atom or
None</p>

<p>BadImplementation Invalid reply from server</p>
