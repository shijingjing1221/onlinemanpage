<p>NAME gnutls_handshake_set_post_client_hello_function -
set callback to be called after the client hello is
received</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;gnutls/gnutls.h&gt;</p>

<p>void
gnutls_handshake_set_post_client_hello_function(gnutls_session_t
session, gnutls_handshake_post_client_hello_func func);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS gnutls_session_t session is a gnutls_session_t
structure.</p>

<p>gnutls_handshake_post_client_hello_func func is the
function to be called</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This function will set a callback to be
called after the client hello has been received (callback
valid in server side only). This allows the server to adjust
settings based on received extensions.</p>

<p>Those settings could be ciphersuites, requesting
certificate, or any- thing else except for version
negotiation (this is done before the hello message is
parsed).</p>

<p>This callback must return 0 on success or a gnutls error
code to termi- nate the handshake.</p>

<p>WARNING You should not use this function to terminate
the handshake based on client input unless you know what you
are doing. Before the handshake is finished there is no way
to know if there is a man-in-the-middle attack being
performed.</p>
