<p>NAME squid_ldap_group - Squid LDAP external acl group
helper</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS squid_ldap_group -b &quot;base DN&quot; -f
&quot;LDAP search filter&quot; [options]
[ldap_server_name[:port]|URI]...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This helper allows Squid to connect to a
LDAP directory to authorize users via LDAP groups. LDAP
options are specified as parameters on the command line,
while the username(s) and group(s) to be checked against the
LDAP directory are specified on subsequent lines of input to
the helper, one username/group pair per line separated by a
space.</p>

<p>As expected by the external_acl construct of Squid,
after specifying a username and group followed by a new
line, this helper will produce either OK or ERR on the
following line to show if the user is a member of the
specified group.</p>

<p>The program operates by searching with a search filter
based on the users user name and requested group, and if a
match is found it is determined that the user belongs to the
group.</p>

<p>-b basedn (REQUIRED) Specifies the base DN under which
the groups are located.</p>

<p>-B basedn Specifies the base DN under which the users
are located (if dif- ferent)</p>

<p>-g Specifies that the first query argument sent to the
helper by Squid is a extension to the basedn and will be
temporarily added in front of the global basedn for this
query.</p>

<p>-f filter LDAP search filter used to search the LDAP
directory for any matching group memberships. In the filter
%u will be replaced by the user name (or DN if the -F or -u
options are used) and %g by the requested group name.</p>

<p>-F filter LDAP search filter used to search the LDAP
directory for any matching users. In the filter %s will be
replaced by the user name. If % is to be included literally
in the filter then use %%.</p>

<p>-u attr LDAP attribute used to construct the user DN
from the user name and base dn without needing to search for
the user.</p>

<p>-s base|one|sub search scope. Defaults to sub.</p>

<p>base object only, one level below the base object or
subtree below the base object</p>

<p>-D binddn -w password The DN and password to bind as
while performing searches. Required if the directory does
not allow anonymous searches.</p>

<p>As the password needs to be printed in plain text in
your Squid configuration and will be sent on the command
line to the helper it is strongly recommended to use a
account with minimal associ- ated privileges. This to limit
the damage in case someone could get hold of a copy of your
Squid configuration file or extracts the password used from
a process listing.</p>

<p>-D binddn -W secretfile The DN and the name of a file
containing the password to bind as while performing
searches.</p>

<p>Less insecure version of the former parameter pair with
two advantages: The password does not occur in the process
listing, and the password is not being compromised if
someone gets the squid configuration file without getting
the secretfile.</p>

<p>-P Use a persistent LDAP connection. Normally the LDAP
connection is only open while verifying a users group
membership to pre- serve resources at the LDAP server. This
option causes the LDAP connection to be kept open, allowing
it to be reused for further user validations. Recommended
for larger installations.</p>

<p>-R do not follow referrals</p>

<p>-a never|always|search|find when to dereference aliases.
Defaults to never</p>

<p>never dereference aliases (default), always dereference
aliases, only while searching or only to find the base
object</p>

<p>-H ldapuri Specity the LDAP server to connect to by a
LDAP URI (requires OpenLDAP libraries)</p>

<p>-h ldapserver Specify the LDAP server to connect to</p>

<p>-p ldapport Specify an alternate TCP port where the ldap
server is listening if other than the default LDAP port
389.</p>

<p>-v 2|3 LDAP protocol version. Defaults to 3 if not
specified.</p>

<p>-Z Use TLS encryption</p>

<p>-Ecertpath Enable LDAP over SSL (requires Netscape LDAP
API libraries)</p>

<p>-cconnect_timeout Specify timeout used when connecting
to LDAP servers (requires Netscape LDAP API libraries)</p>

<p>-tsearch_timeout Specify time limit on LDAP search
operations</p>

<p>-S Strip NT domain name component from user names (/ or
sepa- rated)</p>

<p>-K Strip Kerberos Realm component from user names (@
separated)</p>

<p>-d Debug mode where each step taken will get reported in
detail. Useful for understanding what goes wrong if the
results is not what is expected.</p>

<p>SQUID CONFIGURATION This helper is intended to be used
as a external_acl_type helper from squid.conf.</p>

<p>external_acl_type ldap_group %LOGIN
/path/to/squid_ldap_group ... acl group1 external ldap_group
Group1 acl group2 external ldap_group Group2</p>

<p>NOTES When constructing search filters it is recommended
to first test the filter using ldapsearch before you attempt
to use squid_ldap_group. This to verify that the filter
matches what you expect.</p>
