<p>NAME mount.ecryptfs - eCryptfs mount helper.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS mount -t ecryptfs [lower directory] [ecryptfs
mount point]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION mount.ecryptfs is eCryptfs mount helper. The
mount utility will defer to the mount helper to perform
various configuration tasks; use the -i option to bypass the
mount helper if you would rather manually specify your mount
options. To mount eCryptfs, specify the lower directory
(i.e., /root/crypt) for the encrypted files and the eCryptfs
mountpoint (i.e., /mnt/crypt) for the decrypted view of the
files:</p>

<p>mount -t ecryptfs /root/crypt /mnt/crypt</p>

<p>SEE ALSO ecryptfs(7), ecryptfsd(8), ecryptfs-manager(8),
