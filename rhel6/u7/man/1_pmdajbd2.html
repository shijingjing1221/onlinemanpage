<p>PMDAJBD2(1) PMDAJBD2(1)</p>

<p>NAME pmdajbd2 - journal block device (JBD) performance
metrics domain agent (PMDA)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/jbd2/pmdajbd2 [-d domain] [-l
logfile] [-j path] [-U username]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pmdajbd2 is a Performance Metrics Domain
Agent (PMDA) which extracts performance metrics from the
Journal Block Device subsystem (version 2) in the Linux
kernel. These metrics are exported by the kernel in procfs
files, one file per block device. The JBD2 subsystem is used
by several filesystems including ext3, ext4 and ocfs2.</p>

<p>The jbd2 PMDA exports metrics that measure detailed
journal transaction information, such as time spent waiting
and locked, request rates, blocks used and so on.</p>

<p>A brief description of the pmdajbd2 command line options
follows (these are only relevant when running the PMDA as a
daemon, and not as a shared library):</p>

<p>-d It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics
domain num- ber specified here is unique and consistent.
That is, domain should be different for every PMDA on the
one host, and the same domain number should be used for the
same PMDA on all hosts.</p>

<p>-l Location of the log file. By default, when running as
a daemon a log file named jbd2.log is written in the current
directory of when pmdajbd2 is started, i.e.
$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd. If the log file cannot be created or is
not writable, output is written to the standard error
instead. When running in shared library mode, and diagnostic
information will be written into the pmcd log file, namely
$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/pmcd.log.</p>

<p>-j Allows an alternate path to the jbd2 statistics files
to be speci- fied. The default path is /proc/fs/jbd2.</p>

<p>-U User account under which to run the agent. The
default is the unprivileged &quot;pcp&quot; account in
current versions of PCP, but in older versions the superuser
account (&quot;root&quot;) was used by default.</p>

<p>INSTALLATION This PMDA is installed by default and in
the shared library mode (rather than as a separate daemon to
pmcd(1)). Thus, the names, help text and values for the jbd2
performance metrics should always be available.</p>

<p>If you do not use these metrics you can remove this
PMDA, do the fol- lowing as root:</p>

<p># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/jbd2 # ./Remove</p>

<p>If you want to enable the installation again, do the
following as root:</p>

<p># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/jbd2 # ./Install</p>

<p>pmdajbd2 is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be
executed directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify
pmcd(1) when the agent is installed or removed.</p>

<p>FILES $PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH command line options used to
launch pmdajbd2 $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/jbd2/help default help text
file for the jbd2 metrics $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/jbd2/Install
installation script for the pmdajbd2 agent
$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/jbd2/Remove undo installation script for the
pmdajbd2 agent $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/jbd2.log default log file
for error messages and other information from pmdajbd2</p>

<p>PCP ENVIRONMENT Environment variables with the prefix
PCP_ are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP. On each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in pcp.conf(5).</p>
