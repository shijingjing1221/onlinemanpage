<p>Tcl_GetTime(3) Tcl Library Procedures Tcl_GetTime(3)</p>


<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME Tcl_GetTime, Tcl_SetTimeProc, Tcl_QueryTimeProc -
get date and time</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tcl.h&gt;</p>

<p>Tcl_GetTime(timePtr)</p>

<p>Tcl_SetTimeProc(getProc, scaleProc, clientData)</p>

<p>Tcl_QueryTimeProc(getProcPtr, scaleProcPtr,
clientDataPtr)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS Tcl_Time * timePtr (out) Points to memory in
which to store the date and time information.</p>

<p>Tcl_GetTimeProc * getProc (in) Pointer to handler
function replacing Tcl_GetTimes access to the OS.</p>

<p>Tcl_ScaleTimeProc * scaleProc (in) Pointer to handler
function for the conversion of time delays in the virtual
domain to real-time.</p>

<p>ClientData * clientData (in) Value passed through to the
two handler functions.</p>

<p>Tcl_GetTimeProc ** getProcPtr (inout) Pointer to place
the cur- rently registered get han- dler function into.</p>

<p>Tcl_ScaleTimeProc ** scaleProcPtr (inout) Pointer to
place the currently registered scale handler function
into.</p>

<p>ClientData ** clientDataPtr (inout) Pointer to place the
cur- rently registered pass- through value into.

<p>DESCRIPTION The Tcl_GetTime function retrieves the
current time as a Tcl_Time structure in memory the caller
provides. This structure has the fol- lowing definition:
typedef struct Tcl_Time { long sec; long usec; }
Tcl_Time;</p>

<p>On return, the sec member of the structure is filled in
with the number of seconds that have elapsed since the
epoch: the epoch is the point in time of 00:00 UTC, 1
January 1970. This number does not count leap seconds - an
interval of one day advances it by 86400 seconds regard-
less of whether a leap second has been inserted.</p>

<p>The usec member of the structure is filled in with the
number of microseconds that have elapsed since the start of
the second designated by sec. The Tcl library makes every
effort to keep this number as precise as possible, subject
to the limitations of the computer system. On multiprocessor
variants of Windows, this number may be limited to the 10-
or 20-ms granularity of the system clock. (On
single-processor Windows systems, the usec field is derived
from a performance counter and is highly precise.)</p>

<p>The Tcl_SetTime function registers two related handler
functions with the core. The first handler function is a
replacement for Tcl_GetTime, or rather the OS access made by
Tcl_GetTime. The other handler function is used by the Tcl
notifier to convert wait/block times from the vir- tual
domain into real time.</p>

<p>The Tcl_QueryTime function returns the currently
registered handler functions. If no external handlers were
set then this will return the standard handlers accessing
and processing the native time of the OS. The arguments to
the function are allowed to be NULL; and any argument which
is NULL is ignored and not set.</p>

<p>Any handler pair specified has to return data which is
consistent between them. In other words, setting one handler
of the pair to some- thing assuming a 10-times slowdown, and
the other handler of the pair to something assuming a
two-times slowdown is wrong and not allowed.</p>

<p>The set handler functions are allowed to run the
delivered time back- wards, however this should be avoided.
We have to allow it as the native time can run backwards as
the user can fiddle with the system time one way or other.
Note that the insertion of the hooks will not change the
behaviour of the Tcl core with regard to this situation,
i.e. the existing behaviour is retained.</p>
