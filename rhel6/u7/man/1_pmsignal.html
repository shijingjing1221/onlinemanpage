<p>NAME pmsignal - send a signal to one or more
processes</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS $PCP_BINADM_DIR/pmsignal [-a|-l] [-n] [-s
signal] [PID ...|name ...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pmsignal provides a cross-platform event
signalling mechanism for use with tools from the Performance
Co-Pilot toolkit. It can be used to send a named signal
(only HUP, USR1, TERM, and KILL are accepted). to one or
more processes. The processes are specified using PID or the
binary name (with -a option).</p>

<p>If a signal is not specified, then the TERM signal will
be sent.</p>

<p>On Linux and UNIX platforms, pmsignal is a simple
wrapper around the kill(1) command. On Windows, the is no
direct equivalent to this mech- anism, and so an alternate
mechanism has been implemented - this is only honoured by
PCP tools, however, not all Windows utilities.</p>

<p>PCP ENVIRONMENT Environment variables with the prefix
PCP_ are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP. On each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in pcp.conf(5).</p>

<p>SEE ALSO kill(1), killall(1), pcp.conf(5) and
pcp.env(5).</p>
