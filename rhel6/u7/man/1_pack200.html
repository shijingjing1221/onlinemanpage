<p>Name pack200 - JAR Packing tool</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pack200 [ options ] output-file JAR-file</p>

<p>Options may be in any order. The last option on the
command line or in a properties file supersedes all
previously specified options.</p>

<p>options Command-line options.</p>

<p>output-file Name of the output file.</p>

<p>JAR-file Name of the input file.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pack200 tool is a Java application that
transforms a JAR file into a compressed pack200 file using
the Java gzip compressor. The pack200 files are highly
compressed files that can be directly deployed, saving
bandwidth and reducing download time.</p>

<p>The pack200 tool uses several options to fine-tune and
set the compres- sion engine.</p>

<p>Typical usage: % pack200 myarchive.pack.gz
myarchive.jar</p>

<p>In this example, myarchive.pack.gz is produced using the
default pack200 settings.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -r --repack</p>

<p>Produces a JAR file by packing the file myarchive.jar
and unpacking it. The resulting file can be used as an input
to the jarsigner(1) tool.</p>

<p>% pack200 --repack myarchive-packer.jar
myarchive.jar</p>

<p>% pack200 --repack myarchive.jar</p>

<p>-g --no-gzip</p>

<p>Produces a pack200 file. With this option a suitable
compressor must be used, and the target system must use a
corresponding decompresser.</p>

<p>% pack200 --no-gzip myarchive.pack myarchive.jar</p>

<p>-G --strip-debug</p>

<p>Strips attributes used for debugging from the output.
These include SourceFile, LineNumberTable,
LocalVariableTable and LocalVariableType- Table. Removing
these attributes reduces the size of both downloads and
installations but reduces the usefulness of debuggers.</p>

<p>--keep-file-order</p>

<p>Preserve the order of files in the input file; this is
the default behavior.</p>

<p>-O --no-keep-file-order</p>

<p>The packer will reorder and transmit all elements.
Additionally, the packer may remove JAR directory names.
This will reduce the download size; however, certain JAR
file optimizations, such as indexing, may not work
correctly.</p>

<p>-Svalue --segment-limit=value</p>

<p>The value is the estimated target size N (in bytes) of
each archive segment. If a single input file requires more
than N bytes, it will be given its own archive segment. As a
spe- cial case, a value of -1 will produce a single large
segment with all input files, while a value of 0 will
produce one segment for each class. Larger archive segments
result in less fragmentation and better compression, but
processing them requires more memory.</p>

<p>The size of each segment is estimated by counting the
size of each input file to be transmitted in the segment,
along with the size of its name and other transmitted
properties.</p>

<p>The default is -1, which means the packer will always
create a single segment output file. In cases where
extremely large output files are generated, users are
strongly encouraged to use segmenting or break up the input
file into smaller JARs.</p>

<p>A 10MB JAR packed without this limit will typically pack
about 10% smaller, but the packer may require a larger Java
heap (about ten times the segment limit).</p>

<p>-Evalue --effort=value</p>

<p>If the value is set to a single decimal digit, the
packer will use the indicated amount of effort in
compressing the archive. Level 1 may pro- duce somewhat
larger size and faster compression speed, while level 9 will
take much longer but may produce better compression. The
special value 0 instructs the packer to copy through the
original JAR file directly with no compression. The JSR 200
standard requires any unpacker to understand this special
case as a pass-through of the entire archive.</p>

<p>The default is 5, investing a modest amount of time to
produce reason- able compression.</p>

<p>-Hvalue --deflate-hint=value</p>

<p>Overrides the default, which preserves the input
information, but may cause the transmitted archive to be
larger. The possible values are:</p>

<p>true</p>

<p>false In either case, the packer will set the deflation
hint accord- ingly in the output archive, and will not
transmit the individual deflation hints of archive
elements.</p>

<p>keep Preserve deflation hints observed in the input JAR.
(This is the default.)</p>

<p>-mvalue --modification-time=value</p>

<p>The possible values are:</p>

<p>latest The packer will attempt to determine the latest
modification time, among all the available entries in the
original archive, or the latest modification time of all the
available entries in that segment. This single value will be
transmitted as part of the segment and applied to all the
entries in each segment. This can marginally decrease the
transmitted size of the archive at the expense of setting
all installed files to a single date.</p>

<p>keep Preserves modification times observed in the input
JAR. (This is the default.)</p>

<p>-Pfile --pass-file=file</p>

<p>Indicates that a file should be passed through bytewise
with no com- pression. By repeating the option, multiple
files may be specified. There is no pathname transformation,
except that the system file sepa- rator is replaced by the
JAR file separator &quot;/&quot;. The resulting file names
must match exactly as strings with their occurrences in the
JAR file. If file is a directory name, all files under that
directory will be passed.</p>

<p>-Uaction --unknown-attribute=action</p>

<p>Overrides the default behavior; i.e., the classfile
containing the unknown attribute will be passed through with
the specified action. The possible values for actions
are:</p>

<p>error The pack200 operation as a whole will fail with a
suitable expla- nation.</p>

<p>strip The attribute will be dropped. Note: Removing the
required VM attributes may cause Class Loader failures.</p>

<p>pass Upon encountering this attribute, the entire class
will be trans- mitted as though it is a resource.</p>

<p>-Cattribute-name=layout
--class-attribute=attribute-name=action
-Fattribute-name=layout
--field-attribute=attribute-name=action
-Mattribute-name=layout
--method-attribute=attribute-name=action
-Dattribute-name=layout
--code-attribute=attribute-name=action</p>

<p>With the above four options, the attribute layout can be
specified for a class entity, such as Class attribute, Field
attribute, Method attribute, and Code attribute. The
attribute-name is the name of the attribute for which the
layout or action is being defined. The possible values for
action are:</p>

<p>some-layout-string The layout language is defined in the
JSR 200 specification.</p>

<p>Example: --class-attribute=SourceFile=RUH</p>

<p>error Upon encountering this attribute, the pack200
operation will fail with a suitable explanation.</p>

<p>strip Upon encountering this attribute, the attribute
will be removed from the output. Note: removing VM-required
attributes may cause Class Loader failures.</p>

<p>Example: --class-attribute=CompilationID=pass will cause
the class file containing this attribute to be passed
through without further action by the packer.</p>

<p>-f pack.properties --config-file=pack.properties</p>

<p>A configuration file, containing Java properties to
initialize the packer, may be specified on the command
line.</p>

<p>% pack200 -f pack.properties myarchive.pack.gz
myarchive.jar % more pack.properties # Generic properties
for the packer. modification.time=latest deflate.hint=false
keep.file.order=false # This option will cause the files
bearing new attributes to # be reported as an error rather
than passed uncompressed. unknown.attribute=error # Change
the segment limit to be unlimited. segment.limit=-1</p>

<p>-v --verbose</p>

<p>Outputs minimal messages. Multiple specification of this
option will output more verbose messages.</p>

<p>-q --quiet</p>

<p>Specifies quiet operation with no messages.</p>

<p>-lfilename --log-file=filename</p>

<p>Specifies a log file to output messages.</p>

<p>-? -h --help</p>

<p>Prints help information about this command.</p>

<p>-V --version</p>

<p>Prints version information about this command.</p>

<p>-Joption</p>

<p>Passes option to the Java launcher called by pack200.
For example, -J-Xms48m sets the startup memory to 48
megabytes. Although it does not begin with -X, it is not a
standard option of pack200. It is a common convention for -J
to pass options to the underlying VM executing appli-
cations written in Java.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values are returned:</p>

<p>0 for successful completion;</p>

<p>&gt;0 if an error occurs.</p>
