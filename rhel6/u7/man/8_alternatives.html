<p>NAME alternatives - maintain symbolic links determining
default commands</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS alternatives [options] --install link name path
priority [--slave link name path]... [--initscript
service]</p>

<p>alternatives [options] --remove name path</p>

<p>alternatives [options] --set name path</p>

<p>alternatives [options] --auto name</p>

<p>alternatives [options] --display name</p>

<p>alternatives [options] --config name</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION alternatives creates, removes, maintains and
displays information about the symbolic links comprising the
alternatives system. The alternatives system is a
reimplementation of the Debian alternatives system. It was
rewritten primarily to remove the dependence on perl; it is
intended to be a drop in replacement for Debian s
update-dependencies script. This man page is a slightly
modified version of the man page from the Debian
project.</p>

<p>It is possible for several programs fulfilling the same
or similar functions to be installed on a single system at
the same time. For example, many systems have several text
editors installed at once. This gives choice to the users of
a system, allowing each to use a dif- ferent editor, if
desired, but makes it difficult for a program to make a good
choice of editor to invoke if the user has not specified a
par- ticular preference.</p>

<p>The alternatives system aims to solve this problem. A
generic name in the filesystem is shared by all files
providing interchangeable func- tionality. The alternatives
system and the system administrator together determine which
actual file is referenced by this generic name. For example,
if the text editors ed(1) and nvi(1) are both installed on
the system, the alternatives system will cause the generic
name /usr/bin/editor to refer to /usr/bin/nvi by default.
The system administrator can override this and cause it to
refer to /usr/bin/ed instead, and the alternatives system
will not alter this setting until explicitly requested to do
so.</p>

<p>The generic name is not a direct symbolic link to the
selected alterna- tive. Instead, it is a symbolic link to a
name in the alternatives directory, which in turn is a
symbolic link to the actual file refer- enced. This is done
so that the system administrator s changes can be confined
within the /etc directory: the FHS (q.v.) gives reasons why
this is a Good Thing.</p>

<p>When each package providing a file with a particular
functionality is installed, changed or removed, alternatives
is called to update infor- mation about that file in the
alternatives system. alternatives is usually called from the
%post or %pre scripts in RPM packages.</p>

<p>It is often useful for a number of alternatives to be
synchronised, so that they are changed as a group; for
example, when several versions of the vi(1) editor are
installed, the man page referenced by
/usr/share/man/man1/vi.1 should correspond to the executable
referenced by /usr/bin/vi. alternatives handles this by
means of master and slave links; when the master is changed,
any associated slaves are changed too. A master link and its
associated slaves make up a link group.</p>

<p>Each link group is, at any given time, in one of two
modes: automatic or manual. When a group is in automatic
mode, the alternatives system will automatically decide, as
packages are installed and removed, whether and how to
update the links. In manual mode, the alternatives system
will not change the links; it will leave all the decisions
to the system administrator.</p>

<p>Link groups are in automatic mode when they are first
introduced to the system. If the system administrator makes
changes to the systems automatic settings, this will be
noticed the next time alternatives is run on the changed
link s group, and the group will automatically be switched
to manual mode.</p>

<p>Each alternative has a priority associated with it. When
a link group is in automatic mode, the alternatives pointed
to by members of the group will be those which have the
highest priority.</p>

<p>When using the --config option, alternatives will list
all of the choices for the link group of which given name is
the master link. You will then be prompted for which of the
choices to use for the link group. Once you make a change,
the link group will no longer be in auto mode. You will need
to use the --auto option in order to return to the automatic
state.</p>

<p>TERMINOLOGY Since the activities of alternatives are
quite involved, some specific terms will help to explain its
operation.</p>

<p>generic name A name, like /usr/bin/editor, which refers,
via the alternatives system, to one of a number of files of
similar function.</p>

<p>symlink Without any further qualification, this means a
symbolic link in the alternatives directory: one which the
system administrator is expected to adjust.</p>

<p>alternative The name of a specific file in the
filesystem, which may be made accessible via a generic name
using the alternatives system.</p>

<p>alternatives directory A directory, by default
/etc/alternatives, containing the sym- links.</p>

<p>administrative directory A directory, by default
/var/lib/alternatives, containing alter- natives state
information.</p>

<p>link group A set of related symlinks, intended to be
updated as a group.</p>

<p>master link The link in a link group which determines
how the other links in the group are configured.</p>

<p>slave link A link in a link group which is controlled by
the setting of the master link.</p>

<p>automatic mode When a link group is in automatic mode,
the alternatives system ensures that the links in the group
point to the highest priority alternatives appropriate for
the group.</p>

<p>manual mode When a link group is in manual mode, the
alternatives system will not make any changes to the system
administrators set- tings.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Exactly one action must be specified if
alternatives is to perform any meaningful task. Any number
of the common options may be specified together with any
action.</p>

<p>COMMON OPTIONS --verbose Generate more comments about
what alternatives is doing.</p>

<p>--quiet Dont generate any comments unless errors occur.
This option is not yet implemented.</p>

<p>--test Dont actually do anything, just say what would be
done. This option is not yet implemented.</p>

<p>--help Give some usage information (and say which
version of alterna- tives this is).</p>

<p>--version Tell which version of alternatives this is
(and give some usage information).</p>

<p>--altdir directory Specifies the alternatives directory,
when this is to be differ- ent from the default.</p>

<p>--admindir directory Specifies the administrative
directory, when this is to be dif- ferent from the
default.</p>

<p>ACTIONS --install link name path priority [--slave slink
sname spath] [--initscript service]... Add a group of
alternatives to the system. name is the generic name for the
master link, link is the name of its symlink, path is the
alternative being introduced for the master link, and
priority is the priority of the alternatives group. Higher
pri- orities take precendence if no alternative is manually
selected. sname, slink and spath are the generic name,
symlink name and alternative for a slave link, and service
is the name of any associated initscript for the
alternative. NOTE: --initscript is a Red Hat Linux specific
option. Zero or more --slave options, each followed by three
arguments, may be specified.</p>

<p>If the master symlink specified exists already in the
alterna- tives systems records, the information supplied
will be added as a new set of alternatives for the group.
Otherwise, a new group, set to automatic mode, will be added
with this informa- tion. If the group is in automatic mode,
and the newly added alternatives priority is higher than any
other installed alter- natives for this group, the symlinks
will be updated to point to the newly added
alternatives.</p>

<p>If --initscript is used, the alternatives system will
manage the initscript associated with the alternative via
chkconfig, regis- tering and unregistering the init script
depending on which alternative is active.</p>

<p>NOTE: --initscript is a Red Hat Linux specific
option.</p>

<p>--remove name path Remove an alternative and all of its
associated slave links. name is a name in the alternatives
directory, and path is an absolute filename to which name
could be linked. If name is indeed linked to path, name will
be updated to point to another appropriate alternative, or
removed if there is no such alterna- tive left. Associated
slave links will be updated or removed, correspondingly. If
the link is not currently pointing to path, no links are
changed; only the information about the alternative is
removed.</p>

<p>--set name path The symbolic link and slaves for link
group name set to those configured for path, and the link
group is set to manual mode. This option is not in the
original Debian implementation.</p>

<p>--config name Present the user with a configuration menu
for choosing the mas- ter link and slaves for link group
name. Once chosen, the link group is set to manual mode.</p>

<p>--auto name Switch the master symlink name to automatic
mode. In the pro- cess, this symlink and its slaves are
updated to point to the highest priority installed
alternatives.</p>

<p>--display name Display information about the link group
of which name is the master link. Information displayed
includes the groups mode (auto or manual), which alternative
the symlink currently points to, what other alternatives are
available (and their correspond- ing slave alternatives),
and the highest priority alternative currently
installed.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/alternatives/ The default alternatives
directory. Can be overridden by the --altdir option.</p>

<p>/var/lib/alternatives/ The default administration
directory. Can be overridden by the --admindir option.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS 0 The requested action was successfully
performed.</p>

<p>2 Problems were encountered whilst parsing the command
line or performing the action.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS alternatives chatters incessantly about its
activities on its standard output channel. If problems
occur, alternatives outputs error messages on its standard
error channel and returns an exit status of 2. These
diagnostics should be self-explanatory; if you do not find
them so, please report this as a bug.</p>

<p>BUGS If you find a bug, please report it using the Red
Hat bug tracking sys- tem at http://bugzilla.redhat.com.</p>

<p>If you find any discrepancy between the operation of
alternatives and this manual page, it is a bug, either in
the implementation or the doc- umentation; please report it.
Any significant differences between this implementation and
Debians is also a bug and should be reported, unless
otherwise noted in this man page.</p>
