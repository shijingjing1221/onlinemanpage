<p>NAME ppmhist - print a histogram of the colors in a PPM
image</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ppmhist [-hexcolor | -float | -colorname |
-map] [-nomap] [-noheader] [-sort={frequency,rgb}]
[ppmfile]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>ppmhistreads a PPM image as input and generates a
histogram of the col- ors in the image, i.e. a list of all
the colors and how many pixels of each color are in the
image.</p>

<p>Output Format The output is in one of two basic formats:
a report for humans and a PPM image for use by programs. The
PPM image is actually quite read- able by humans too.</p>

<p>Human Report</p>

<p>You get this format by specifying (or defaulting to) the
-nomap option.</p>

<p>The format is one line for each color in the input
image.</p>

<p>By default, there are two lines of column header at the
top. Use the -noheader option to suppress those lines.</p>

<p>In each line, ppmhist identifies the color by red,
green, and blue com- ponents. By default, it lists each of
these in decimal, using the exact values that are in the PPM
input. So if the image has a maxval of 255, the numbers in
the listing range from 0 to 255. With the -hex- color
option, you can change these numbers to hexadecimal. With
the -float option, the numbers are fractional, adjusted to a
maxval of 1.</p>

<p>Each line lists the luminosity of the color. It is in
decimal on the same scale as the rgb values (see above).</p>

<p>Each line lists the number of pixels in the image that
have the color. This is in decimal.</p>

<p>PPM Output</p>

<p>You get this format with the -map option.</p>

<p>The output file is a genuine PPM image, but it is PPM
Plain format and contains comments so that it is not a lot
different from the human report described above.</p>

<p>As a PPM image, it can be useful as input to other
programs that need some kind of palette. The image is a
single row with one column for each distinct color in the
image.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -sort={frequency,rgb} The -sort option
determines the order in which the colors are listed in the
output. frequency means to list them in order of how pixels
in the input image have the color, with the most rep-
resented colors first. rgb means to sort them first by the
intensity of the red component of the color, then of the
green, then of the blue, with the least intense first.</p>

<p>The default is frequency.</p>

<p>-hexcolor Print the color components in hexadecimal. See
output format .</p>

<p>You may not specify this option along with -float or
map.</p>

<p>-float Print the color components and the luminosity as
floating point numbers in the range [0,1]. See output format
.</p>

<p>You may not specify this option along with -hexcolor or
map.</p>

<p>This option was added in Netpbm 10.19 (November
2003).</p>

<p>-map Generates a PPM file of the colormap for the image,
with the color histogram as comments. See output format
.</p>

<p>You may not specify this option along with -float or
hexcolor.</p>

<p>-nomap Generates the histogram for human reading. This
is the default.</p>

<p>-colorname Add the color name to the output. This is the
name from the system color dictionary . If the exact color
is not in the color dictionary, it is the closest color that
is in the dictio- nary and is preceded by a *. If you don t
have a system color dictionary, the program fails.</p>

<p>This option was added in Netpbm 10.10 (October
2002).</p>

<p>-noheader Do not print the column headings.</p>
