<p>NAME syslinux2ansi - converts a syslinux-format screen
to pc-ansi</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS syslinux2ansi &lt; filename.input &gt;
filename.output</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Syslinux2ansi is a filter which converts a
screen formatted for sys- linux to one compatible with PC
ANSI. It will only read from standard in, and has no command
line options.</p>

<p>BUGS Help and version command line options would be
useful.</p>

<p>The ability to put input and output filenames on the
command line might be good as well.</p>

<p>Bug reports I would appreciate hearing of any problems
you have with SYSLINUX. I would also like to hear from you
if you have successfully used SYS- LINUX, especially if you
are using it for a distribution.</p>

<p>If you are reporting problems, please include all
possible information about your system and your BIOS; the
vast majority of all problems reported turn out to be BIOD
or hardware bugs, and I need as much information as possible
in order to diagnose the problems.</p>

<p>There is a mailing list for discussion among SYSLINUX
users and for announcements of new and test versions. To
join, send a message to majordomo@linux.kernel.org with the
line:</p>

<p>subscribe syslinux</p>

<p>in the body of the message. The submission address is
sys- linux@linux.kernel.org.</p>

<p>AUTHOR This manual page is a quick write-up for Debian
done by Kevin Kreamer &lt;kkreamer@etherhogz.org&gt;, by
looking over the 1 screenful of Perl that is
syslinux2ansi.</p>
