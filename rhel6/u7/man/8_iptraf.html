<p>NAME iptraf - Interactive Colorful IP LAN Monitor</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS iptraf { [ -f ] [ -q ] [ { -i iface | -g | -d
iface | -s iface | -z iface | -l iface } [ -t timeout ] [ -B
[ -L logfile ] ] ] | [ -h ] }</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION iptraf is an ncurses-based IP LAN monitor
that generates various net- work statistics including TCP
info, UDP counts, ICMP and OSPF informa- tion, Ethernet load
info, node stats, IP checksum errors, and others.</p>

<p>If the command is issued without any command-line
options, the program comes up in interactive mode, with the
various facilities accessed through the main menu.</p>

<p>OPTIONS These options can also be supplied to the
command:</p>

<p>-i iface immediately start the IP traffic monitor on the
specified inter- face, or all interfaces if &quot;-i
all&quot; is specified</p>

<p>-g immediately start the general interface
statistics</p>

<p>-d iface allows you to immediately start the detailed on
the indicated interface (iface)</p>

<p>-s iface allows you to immediately monitor TCP and UDP
traffic on the specified interface (iface)</p>

<p>-z iface shows packet counts by size on the specified
interface</p>

<p>-l iface start the LAN station monitor on the specified
interface, or all LAN interfaces if &quot;-l all&quot; is
specified</p>

<p>-t timeout tells IPTraf to run the specified facility
for only timeout min- utes. This option is used only with
one of the above parame- ters.</p>

<p>-B redirect standard output to /dev/null, closes
standard input, and forks the program into the background.
Can be used only with one of the facility invocation
parameters above. Send the backgrounded process a USR2
signal to terminate.</p>

<p>-L logfile allows you to specify an alternate log file
name. The default log file name is based on either the
interface selected (detailed interface statistics, TCP/UDP
service statistics, packet size breakdown), or the instance
of the facility (IP traffic monitor, LAN station monitor).
If a path is not speci- fied, the log file is placed in
/var/log/iptraf</p>

<p>-f clears all locks and counters, causing this instance
of IPTraf to think its the first one running. This should
only be used to recover from an abnormal termination or
system crash.</p>

<p>-q no longer needed, maintained only for
compatibility.</p>

<p>-h shows a command summary</p>

<p>SIGNALS SIGUSR1 - rotates log files while program is
running SIGUSR2 - terminates an IPTraf process running in
the background.</p>

<p>FILES /var/log/iptraf/*.log - log file /var/lib/iptraf/*
- important IPTraf data files</p>
