<p>mplayer_selinux(8) SELinux Policy mplayer

<p>NAME mplayer_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy
for the mplayer pro- cesses</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the mplayer
processes via flexible mandatory access control.</p>

<p>The mplayer processes execute with the mplayer_t SELinux
type. You can check if you have these processes running by
executing the ps command with the -Z qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep mplayer_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The mplayer_t SELinux type can be entered
via the mplayer_exec_t file type.</p>

<p>The default entrypoint paths for the mplayer_t domain
are the follow- ing:</p>

<p>/usr/bin/vlc, /usr/bin/xine, /usr/bin/mplayer</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux mplayer policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their mplayer processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for mplayer:</p>

<p>mplayer_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a mplayer_t can be used to
make the process type mplayer_t permissive. SELinux does not
deny access to permissive process types, but the AVC
(SELinux denials) messages are still gener- ated.</p>

<p>BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable based on least
access required. mplayer policy is extremely flexible and
has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy
and run mplayer with the tightest access possi- ble.</p>

<p>If you want to allow all domains to use other domains
file descriptors, you must turn on the allow_domain_fd_use
boolean. Enabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_domain_fd_use 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow unconfined executables to map a
memory region as both executable and writable, this is
dangerous and the executable should be reported in
bugzilla), you must turn on the allow_execmem boolean.
Enabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_execmem 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow all unconfined executables to use
libraries requiring text relocation that are not labeled
textrel_shlib_t), you must turn on the allow_execmod
boolean. Enabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_execmod 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow mplayer executable stack, you must
turn on the allow_mplayer_execstack boolean. Disabled by
default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_mplayer_execstack 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow sysadm to debug or ptrace all
processes, you must turn on the allow_ptrace boolean.
Disabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_ptrace 1</p>

<p>If you want to allows clients to write to the X server
shared memory segments, you must turn on the
allow_write_xshm boolean. Disabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_write_xshm 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow all domains to have the kernel load
modules, you must turn on the domain_kernel_load_modules
boolean. Disabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P domain_kernel_load_modules 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow all domains to execute in
fips_mode, you must turn on the fips_mode boolean. Enabled
by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P fips_mode 1</p>

<p>If you want to enable reading of urandom for all
domains, you must turn on the global_ssp boolean. Disabled
by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P global_ssp 1</p>

<p>If you want to support NFS home directories, you must
turn on the use_nfs_home_dirs boolean. Disabled by
default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P use_nfs_home_dirs 1</p>

<p>If you want to support SAMBA home directories, you must
turn on the use_samba_home_dirs boolean. Disabled by
default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P use_samba_home_dirs 1</p>

<p>If you want to support X userspace object manager, you
must turn on the xserver_object_manager boolean. Disabled by
default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P xserver_object_manager 1</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type mplayer_t can
manage files labeled with the following file types. The
paths listed are the default paths for these file types.
Note the processes UID still need to have DAC
permissions.</p>

<p>cifs_t</p>

<p>initrc_tmp_t</p>

<p>mnt_t</p>

<p>/mnt(/[^/]*) /mnt(/[^/]*)? /rhev(/[^/]*)? /media(/[^/]*)
/media(/[^/]*)? /etc/rhgb(/.*)? /media/.hal-.* /net /afs
/rhev /misc</p>

<p>mplayer_home_t</p>

<p>/home/[^/]*/.mplayer(/.*)?
/home/staff/.mplayer(/.*)?</p>

<p>mplayer_tmpfs_t</p>

<p>nfs_t</p>

<p>tmp_t</p>

<p>/tmp /usr/tmp /var/tmp /tmp-inst /var/tmp-inst
/var/tmp/vi.recover</p>

<p>user_fonts_cache_t</p>

<p>/home/[^/]*/.fonts/auto(/.*)?
/home/[^/]*/.fontconfig(/.*)? /home/[^/]*/.fonts.cache-.*
/home/staff/.fonts/auto(/.*)? /home/staff/.fontconfig(/.*)?
/home/staff/.fonts.cache-.*</p>

<p>xserver_tmpfs_t</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux mplayer policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their mplayer processes in as secure
a method as possible.</p>

<p>STANDARD FILE CONTEXT</p>

<p>SELinux defines the file context types for the mplayer,
if you wanted to store files with these types in a diffent
paths, you need to execute the semanage command to sepecify
alternate labeling and then use restorecon to put the labels
on disk.</p>

<p>semanage fcontext -a -t mplayer_tmpfs_t
/srv/mymplayer_content(/.*)? restorecon -R -v
/srv/mymplayer_content</p>

<p>Note: SELinux often uses regular expressions to specify
labels that match multiple files.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for mplayer:</p>

<p>mplayer_etc_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the mplayer_etc_t type, if you want to
store mplayer files in the /etc directories.</p>

<p>mplayer_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the mplayer_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the mplayer_t domain.</p>

<p>Paths: /usr/bin/vlc, /usr/bin/xine, /usr/bin/mplayer</p>

<p>mplayer_home_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the mplayer_home_t type, if you want to
store mplayer files in the users home directory.</p>

<p>Paths: /home/[^/]*/.mplayer(/.*)?,
/home/staff/.mplayer(/.*)?</p>

<p>mplayer_tmpfs_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the mplayer_tmpfs_t type, if you want
to store mplayer files on a tmpfs file system.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage boolean can also be used to manipulate the
booleans</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
