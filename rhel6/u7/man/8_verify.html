<p>VERIFY(8) VERIFY(8)</p>

<p>NAME verify - Postfix address verification server</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS verify [generic Postfix daemon options]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The verify(8) address verification server
maintains a record of what recipient addresses are known to
be deliverable or undeliverable.</p>

<p>Addresses are verified by injecting probe messages into
the Postfix queue. Probe messages are run through all the
routing and rewriting machinery except for final delivery,
and are discarded rather than being deferred or bounced.</p>

<p>Address verification relies on the answer from the
nearest MTA for the specified address, and will therefore
not detect all undeliverable addresses.</p>

<p>The verify(8) server is designed to run under control by
the Postfix master server. It maintains an optional
persistent database. To avoid being interrupted by
&quot;postfix stop&quot; in the middle of a database update,
the process runs in a separate process group.</p>

<p>The verify(8) server implements the following
requests:</p>

<p>update address status text Update the status and text of
the specified address.</p>

<p>query address Look up the status and text for the
specified address. If the status is unknown, a probe is sent
and an &quot;in progress&quot; status is returned.</p>

<p>SECURITY The address verification server is not
security-sensitive. It does not talk to the network, and it
does not talk to local users. The verify server can run
chrooted at fixed low privilege.</p>

<p>The address verification server can be coerced to store
unlimited amounts of garbage. Limiting the cache size trades
one problem (disk space exhaustion) for another one (poor
response time to client requests).</p>

<p>With Postfix version 2.5 and later, the verify(8) server
no longer uses root privileges when opening the
address_verify_map cache file. The file should now be stored
under the Postfix-owned data_directory. As a migration aid,
an attempt to open a cache file under a non-Postfix
directory is redirected to the Postfix-owned data_directory,
and a warning is logged.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS Problems and transactions are logged to
syslogd(8).</p>

<p>BUGS The address verification service is suitable only
for sites that handle a low mail volume. Verification probes
add additional traffic to the mail queue and perform poorly
under high load. Servers may blacklist sites that probe
excessively, or that probe excessively for non-exis- tent
recipient addresses.</p>

<p>If the persistent database ever gets corrupted then the
world comes to an end and human intervention is needed. This
violates a basic Postfix principle.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS Changes to main.cf are not
picked up automatically, as verify(8) pro- cesses are
persistent. Use the command &quot;postfix reload&quot; after
a config- uration change.</p>

<p>The text below provides only a parameter summary. See
postconf(5) for more details including examples.</p>

<p>CACHE CONTROLS address_verify_map (empty) Optional
lookup table for persistent address verification status
storage.</p>

<p>address_verify_sender ($double_bounce_sender) The sender
address to use in address verification probes; prior to
Postfix 2.5 the default was &quot;postmaster&quot;.</p>

<p>address_verify_positive_expire_time (31d) The time after
which a successful probe expires from the address
verification cache.</p>

<p>address_verify_positive_refresh_time (7d) The time after
which a successful address verification probe needs to be
refreshed.</p>

<p>address_verify_negative_cache (yes) Enable caching of
failed address verification probe results.</p>

<p>address_verify_negative_expire_time (3d) The time after
which a failed probe expires from the address verification
cache.</p>

<p>address_verify_negative_refresh_time (3h) The time after
which a failed address verification probe needs to be
refreshed.</p>

<p>PROBE MESSAGE ROUTING CONTROLS By default, probe
messages are delivered via the same route as regular
messages. The following parameters can be used to override
specific message routing mechanisms.</p>

<p>address_verify_relayhost ($relayhost) Overrides the
relayhost parameter setting for address verifica- tion
probes.</p>

<p>address_verify_transport_maps ($transport_maps)
Overrides the transport_maps parameter setting for address
veri- fication probes.</p>

<p>address_verify_local_transport ($local_transport)
Overrides the local_transport parameter setting for address
ver- ification probes.</p>

<p>address_verify_virtual_transport ($virtual_transport)
Overrides the virtual_transport parameter setting for
address verification probes.</p>

<p>address_verify_relay_transport ($relay_transport)
Overrides the relay_transport parameter setting for address
ver- ification probes.</p>

<p>address_verify_default_transport ($default_transport)
Overrides the default_transport parameter setting for
address verification probes.</p>

<p>MISCELLANEOUS CONTROLS config_directory (seepostconf
-doutput) The default location of the Postfix main.cf and
master.cf con- figuration files.</p>

<p>daemon_timeout (18000s) How much time a Postfix daemon
process may take to handle a request before it is terminated
by a built-in watchdog timer.</p>

<p>ipc_timeout (3600s) The time limit for sending or
receiving information over an internal communication
channel.</p>

<p>process_id (read-only) The process ID of a Postfix
command or daemon process.</p>

<p>process_name (read-only) The process name of a Postfix
command or daemon process.</p>

<p>queue_directory (seepostconf -doutput) The location of
the Postfix top-level queue directory.</p>

<p>syslog_facility (mail) The syslog facility of Postfix
logging.</p>

<p>syslog_name (seepostconf -doutput) The mail system name
that is prepended to the process name in syslog records, so
that &quot;smtpd&quot; becomes, for example, &quot;post-
fix/smtpd&quot;.</p>
