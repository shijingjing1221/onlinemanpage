<p>NAME rate-files - Format of rate-files</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The rate-files used by isdnlog(8) and by
isdnrate(1) are textfiles defining the telephone fees for
different destinations at certain dates/times for all
providers of one country. The rate-files have the following
overall layout:</p>

<p>Header entries</p>

<p>Provider entries</p>

<p>Comments starting with a hash-sign # and empty lines are
ignored. The first letter (tag) followed by a colon
separates the entries. Addi- tional white space may be used
after the tags to group content more readably.</p>

<p>Special entries I:includefile</p>

<p>i:includefile</p>

<p>includefile get s substituted at the current position.
There are two possibilities. In the rate source file (which
is prepared by pp_rate) a small _i_ puts the contents of the
include file in the outputfile. An _I_-Tag means, for the
preprocessor, write a new output file (the includefile) and
leave the tag in the rate- files. This is for real include
files. Includes may be nested twice. The filename should not
contain any paths (except for i of course), they are taken
relative to their parent file.</p>

<p>Header entries V:versionsstring</p>

<p>e.g. V:1.0-Germany [18-Mar-1999]</p>

<p>S:Servicename</p>

<p>N:Servicenumber[,Servicenumber...]</p>

<p>This defines telephone services with special numbers.
Special numbers are numbers which a) start with no 0 or b)
can not be dialed with every provider. A number with a
variable length should have the wildcard * at the end, eg.
07189* which matches all numbers starting with 07189.
Numbers with wildcards should be placed after numbers which
would match the wildcard, because matching is done straight
top down. There may be multi- ple N: tags for one telephone
service.</p>

<p>e.g. S:Internet N:07189*,19430 N:19440</p>

<p>U:currencyfmt currency</p>

<p>If the first char of currencyfmt is ^, the amount is
multiplied by 100 before it is displayed without leading
^.</p>

<p>e.g. (one of these, &cent; = cent) U:%.3f EUR U:^%.3f
&cent;</p>

<p>X:num_wildcard = provider[zZone] [,...]</p>

<p>Define exception. If a certain number is always routed
to a cer- tain provider and not to the preselected provider,
you should use this tag. e.g. in Austria, online service
numbers 194x or 07189 go always via Telekom, ignoring your
preselection: X: 194*=1,07189*=1 or X: 194*=1z6 # Provider 1
Zone 6</p>

<p>Provider entries A new provider starts always with a P:
tag and consists of a Provider- header followed by
Providerzones.</p>

<p>Providerheader P:[daterange] providernumber
providername</p>

<p>daterange is [[fromDate][-toDate]] This defines a time
range for the validity of rates for this provider. Dates
have to be numeric in format dd.mm.yyyy. Note: as time is
assumed as 00:00, take for toDate the day+1. The dat- erange
has to be enclosed in square brackets. Either fromDate or
-toDate or both may be given. The providernumber may be a
simple number, normally the last digits of the VBN-number,
or providernumber,variant if a provider has different
connection fees. e.g. P:02 UTA or P:[01.01.1999] 1,1 Telekom
Minimumfee</p>

<p>B:vbn</p>

<p>VBN-Number for provider</p>

<p>e.g. B:1002 This is the number to select this provider
and depends on your country.</p>

<p>C:COMMENT: comment</p>

<p>COMMENT may be an arbitrary string, but the following
entries are used already:</p>

<p>C:Name: Providername C:Maintainer: Who did the hard work
C:TarifChanged: and when C:Address: Provideraddress
C:Homepage: http:URL for provider C:TarifURL: URL for tarif
info C:EMail: EMail-Address C:Telefon: Telefon number
C:Telefax: Fax number C:Hotline: Telefon number C:Zone:
Textual info about zones C:Special: Guess C:GT: Additional
charge text C:GF: Additional charge formula</p>

<p>If there are multiple comments with the same comment
name, they get appended separated by a newline char.</p>

<p>D:zone</p>

<p>Name of zone file (inserted for %s in ZONEFILE =
/usr/lib/isdn/zone- CC-%s.dat from isdn.conf)</p>

<p>e.g. D:1001 # zone file is zone-at-1001.gdbm</p>

<p>Note: if the provider has no different domestic zones,
you should not define a D:tag.</p>

<p>Providerzones A Providerzone entry starts with a Z: tag
followed by one or more A: and T: tags.</p>

<p>A zone is a region of areas, for which the same rates
apply. Domestic and foreign zones should not be mixed and
all foreign zones should fol- low domestic zones.</p>

<p>R:prov, sub ; zonelist</p>

<p>Read zones from provider prov subprovider number sub. A
zonelist is defined below. If the referenced provider doesnt
have a subprovider number, the sub must be -1. The
referenced provider may be defined before or after the
R:-tag. The referenced zones must be real Z:-entries, not
references themself. The zone numbers and names are taken
from the referenced provider. The last to_zone may be
missing then all zones from the start zone are used. e.g.
R:1,1 ; 1-4,6, 10-</p>

<p>There some limitations: The reference cannot be more
exact than the referenced providerzones. R:42,0;1 will not
work as desired if P:42,0 defines Z:1-4. It is not possible
to reference a providerzone without areas when the default
domestic zone (with your countrycode as area) is not
included in the same range of referenced zones. This applies
mainly to zones for different distances in the national
fixed network, e.g. Z:1-3 in Germany.</p>

<p>r:prov, sub ; start_zone-</p>

<p>This tag is related to the R:-tag. It is interpreted by
the rate-pre- processor pp_rate. All providerzones with a
zone number greater or equal start_zone are copied from
provider prov[,sub] and replace the r:-tag. If an area is
already used in a previous providerzone of the current
provider, it will not be copied. If all areas of a provider-
zone are already defined, the entire zone will not be
copied. Lines that contain only comments are also not
copied, but comments at the end of other lines are.</p>

<p>This tag is designed for providers with a rate variant
that offers dif- ferent fees for some foreign
destinations.</p>

<p>Z:zonelist zonename</p>

<p>where zonelist is zone[-to_zone][,...]</p>

<p>e.g. Z:1-2,4 Interior</p>

<p>A:area[,area...]</p>

<p>area may be a telephone number (including +countrycode
for numbers which may be reached from everywhere, a
telephone number without +coun- trycode for numbers only
reachable in the own country) or an area name or alias as
defined in country.dat. Country names have to be trans-
lated to their code by the rate-preprocessor pp_rate.</p>

<p>e.g. A:19430,07189 # Online</p>

<p>e.g. A:+31,Belgium # Int 1</p>

<p>Note: There should always be exactly one zone with your
countrycode or countryname respectively:</p>

<p>Z:4 A:+49 T:...</p>

<p>Countrynames like Belgium in the above example are
replaced by their ISO-Code (or TLD) with the rate
preprocessor pp_rate.</p>

<p>T:[daterange]daylist/timelist[!]=chargelist
chargename</p>

<p>where daterange is [[fromDate][-toDate]] like the
corresonding provider entry. Note that the daterange is
enclosed in sqare brackets, either fromDate or -toDate are
optional.</p>

<p>daylist is day[-day][,...] and day is a daynumber
(1=Mon, 2=Tue, ...) or W (workday, Monday to Friday), E
(weekend), H (holiday) or * (every- day). If more than one
of these days match a given date, the following order of
priority (highest first) applies: H 7 .. 1 E W *.</p>

<p>timelist is hour[-hour][,hour] where hour is a number
0..23 or * for everytime.</p>

<p>After daylist/timelist follows = or != which means,
provider doesnt adjust rates on a rate boundary e.g. at
18h00.</p>

<p>A chargelist consists of</p>


<p>[MinCharge|]Charge[(Divider)]/Duration[:Delay][/Duration...]</p>

<p>where MinCharge| is an (optional) minimum charge, Charge
the rate per Duration seconds or optional rate per (Divider)
seconds, Duration is the length of one charge unit in
seconds. After Delay the next duration is taken. If delay is
not given it equals to the duration. The last duration may
not have a delay and may not be zero.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES T:1-4/8-18=1.5(60)/60/1 workday</p>

<p>Monday until Thursday, daytime the charge is 1.50 per
minute, first charge is for one minute after this charging
is calculated in seconds interval.</p>

<p>T:W/18-8=0.30|1.2(60)/1 night</p>

<p>On workdays, night, charge is the bigger of 1.20 per
minute or 0.30</p>

<p>T:*/*=0.50/0,1(60)/1 always</p>

<p>Everyday, everytime there is a connection fee of 0.50,
then charge is 1 per minute.</p>

<p>T:H/*=0.5/60:600,0.5/30 holidays</p>

<p>On holidays, everytime a charge of 0.5 per minute in a
minutes interval, after 10 minutes 0.5 per half minute in
half a minutes interval.</p>

<p>T:*/*=1.3/0,0/1</p>

<p>Everyday, everytime the charge is 1.30 independent of
duration, which could also be written as T:*/*=1.3|0/1.</p>

<p>T: [-01.02.2000] */17-19=0.79(60)/60/1 Happy Hour T:
[-01.02.2000] */19-17=0.90(60)/60/1 Normal</p>

<p>Until the first of Feb 0:00h (i.e. end is 31.1.2000
24:00), everyday between 17 and 19h a charge of 0.79 per
minute, the first minute is always charged fully, after
this, charging is calculated in seconds interval. The second
entry defines a charge of 0.90 in the time outside the happy
hour.</p>

<p>T:[15.11.1999-01.02.2000]*/17-19=0.79(60)/60/1 HH</p>

<p>Like above, but a full date range is given.</p>

<p>The next two t:-tags are interpreted by pp_rate and
replaced by one or more T:-lines. Both methods can be used
together.</p>

<p>t:[daterange]?[H]=chargelist chargename</p>

<p>This line is replaced by according T:-lines for not yet
defined day/hour pairs.</p>

<p>If a daterange is given, only previous T:-lines without
a daterange or with the same daterange will be considered as
earlier definitions. If H is noted, definitions will also be
added for holidays.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE T:W/08-18=0.10/60 normal time t:?H=0.04/60 save
time</p>

<p>This lines will lead to the following lines after
pp_rate:</p>

<p>T:W/08-18=0.10/60 normal time T:W/18-08=0.04/60 save
time T:E,H/*=0.04 save time</p>

<p>t:daterange=srcrange [chargename]</p>

<p>Generates T:-lines for daterange by copying previous
T:-lines with srcrange in the same zone. If a chargename is
given, it will replace the chargename of the originating
line. srcrange can be shortened as long as it remains
definite.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE T:[-24.12.2003]W/*=0.08/60 on workdays
T:[-24.12.2003]E,H/*=0.06 weekend
T:[24.12.2003-25.12.2003]*/*=0.04 Christmas Eve
t:[25.12.2003-31.12.2003]=[-24.12.2003]
t:[31.12.2003-01.01.2004]=[24.12.] New Years Eve
t:[01.01.2004]=[-24.12.]</p>

<p>This will be transformed into:</p>

<p>T:[-24.12.2003]W/*=0.08/60 on workdays
T:[-24.12.2003]E,H/*=0.06/60 weekend
T:[24.12.2003-25.12.2003]*/*=0.04/60 Christmas Eve
T:[25.12.2003-31.12.2003]W/*=0.08/60 on workdays
T:[25.12.2003-31.12.2003]E,H/*=0.06/60 weekend
T:[31.12.2003-01.01.2004]=0.04/60 New Years Eve
T:[01.01.2004]W/*=0.08/60 on workdays
T:[01.01.2004]E,H/*=0.06/60 weekend</p>
