<p>MBSRTOWCS(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
MBSRTOWCS(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME mbsrtowcs - convert a character string to a
wide-character string (restartable)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;wchar.h&gt;</p>

<p>size_t mbsrtowcs(wchar_t *restrict dst, const char
**restrict src, size_t len, mbstate_t *restrict ps);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The mbsrtowcs() function shall convert a
sequence of characters, begin- ning in the conversion state
described by the object pointed to by ps, from the array
indirectly pointed to by src into a sequence of corre-
sponding wide characters. If dst is not a null pointer, the
converted characters shall be stored into the array pointed
to by dst. Conver- sion continues up to and including a
terminating null character, which shall also be stored.
Conversion shall stop early in either of the fol- lowing
cases:</p>

<p>* A sequence of bytes is encountered that does not form
a valid char- acter.</p>

<p>* len codes have been stored into the array pointed to
by dst (and dst is not a null pointer).</p>

<p>Each conversion shall take place as if by a call to the
mbrtowc() func- tion.</p>

<p>If dst is not a null pointer, the pointer object pointed
to by src shall be assigned either a null pointer (if
conversion stopped due to reaching a terminating null
character) or the address just past the last character
converted (if any). If conversion stopped due to reach- ing
a terminating null character, and if dst is not a null
pointer, the resulting state described shall be the initial
conversion state.</p>

<p>If ps is a null pointer, the mbsrtowcs() function shall
use its own internal mbstate_t object, which is initialized
at program start-up to the initial conversion state.
Otherwise, the mbstate_t object pointed to by ps shall be
used to completely describe the current conversion state of
the associated character sequence. The implementation
behaves as if no function defined in this volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001 calls mbsrtowcs().</p>

<p>The behavior of this function shall be affected by the
LC_CTYPE cate- gory of the current locale.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE If the input conversion encounters a
sequence of bytes that do not form a valid character, an
encoding error occurs. In this case, the mbsr- towcs()
function stores the value of the macro [EILSEQ] in errno and
shall return (size_t)-1; the conversion state is undefined.
Otherwise, it shall return the number of characters
successfully converted, not including the terminating null
(if any).</p>

<p>ERRORS The mbsrtowcs() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL ps points to an object that contains an invalid
conversion state.</p>

<p>EILSEQ Invalid character sequence is detected.</p>
