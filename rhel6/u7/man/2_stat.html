<p>STAT(2) Linux Programmer s Manual STAT(2)</p>

<p>NAME stat, fstat, lstat - get file status</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; #include
&lt;sys/stat.h&gt; #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>int stat(const char *path, struct stat *buf); int
fstat(int fd, struct stat *buf); int lstat(const char *path,
struct stat *buf);</p>

<p>Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
feature_test_macros(7)):</p>

<p>lstat(): _BSD_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;= 500</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION These functions return information about a
file. No permissions are required on the file itself, but in
the case of stat() and lstat() execute (search) permission
is required on all of the directories in path that lead to
the file.</p>

<p>stat() stats the file pointed to by path and fills in
buf.</p>

<p>lstat() is identical to stat(), except that if path is a
symbolic link, then the link itself is stat-ed, not the file
that it refers to.</p>

<p>fstat() is identical to stat(), except that the file to
be stat-ed is specified by the file descriptor fd.</p>

<p>All of these system calls return a stat structure, which
contains the following fields:</p>

<p>struct stat { dev_t st_dev; /* ID of device containing
file */ ino_t st_ino; /* inode number */ mode_t st_mode; /*
protection */ nlink_t st_nlink; /* number of hard links */
uid_t st_uid; /* user ID of owner */ gid_t st_gid; /* group
ID of owner */ dev_t st_rdev; /* device ID (if special file)
*/ off_t st_size; /* total size, in bytes */ blksize_t
st_blksize; /* blocksize for file system I/O */ blkcnt_t
st_blocks; /* number of 512B blocks allocated */ time_t
st_atime; /* time of last access */ time_t st_mtime; /* time
of last modification */ time_t st_ctime; /* time of last
status change */ };</p>

<p>The st_dev field describes the device on which this file
resides. (The major(3) and minor(3) macros may be useful to
decompose the device ID in this field.)</p>

<p>The st_rdev field describes the device that this file
(inode) repre- sents.</p>

<p>The st_size field gives the size of the file (if it is a
regular file or a symbolic link) in bytes. The size of a
symlink is the length of the pathname it contains, without a
trailing null byte.</p>

<p>The st_blocks field indicates the number of blocks
allocated to the file, 512-byte units. (This may be smaller
than st_size/512 when the file has holes.)</p>

<p>The st_blksize field gives the &quot;preferred&quot;
blocksize for efficient file system I/O. (Writing to a file
in smaller chunks may cause an ineffi- cient
read-modify-rewrite.)</p>

<p>Not all of the Linux file systems implement all of the
time fields. Some file system types allow mounting in such a
way that file and/or directory accesses do not cause an
update of the st_atime field. (See noatime, nodiratime, and
relatime in mount(8), and related information in mount(2).)
In addition, st_atime is not updated if a file is opened
with the O_NOATIME; see open(2).</p>

<p>The field st_atime is changed by file accesses, for
example, by execve(2), mknod(2), pipe(2), utime(2) and
read(2) (of more than zero bytes). Other routines, like
mmap(2), may or may not update st_atime.</p>

<p>The field st_mtime is changed by file modifications, for
example, by mknod(2), truncate(2), utime(2) and write(2) (of
more than zero bytes). Moreover, st_mtime of a directory is
changed by the creation or dele- tion of files in that
directory. The st_mtime field is not changed for changes in
owner, group, hard link count, or mode.</p>

<p>The field st_ctime is changed by writing or by setting
inode informa- tion (i.e., owner, group, link count, mode,
etc.).</p>

<p>The following POSIX macros are defined to check the file
type using the st_mode field:</p>

<p>S_ISREG(m) is it a regular file?</p>

<p>S_ISDIR(m) directory?</p>

<p>S_ISCHR(m) character device?</p>

<p>S_ISBLK(m) block device?</p>

<p>S_ISFIFO(m) FIFO (named pipe)?</p>

<p>S_ISLNK(m) symbolic link? (Not in POSIX.1-1996.)</p>

<p>S_ISSOCK(m) socket? (Not in POSIX.1-1996.)</p>

<p>The following flags are defined for the st_mode
field:</p>

<p>S_IFMT 0170000 bit mask for the file type bit fields
S_IFSOCK 0140000 socket S_IFLNK 0120000 symbolic link
S_IFREG 0100000 regular file S_IFBLK 0060000 block device
S_IFDIR 0040000 directory S_IFCHR 0020000 character device
S_IFIFO 0010000 FIFO S_ISUID 0004000 set UID bit S_ISGID
0002000 set-group-ID bit (see below) S_ISVTX 0001000 sticky
bit (see below) S_IRWXU 00700 mask for file owner
permissions S_IRUSR 00400 owner has read permission S_IWUSR
00200 owner has write permission S_IXUSR 00100 owner has
execute permission S_IRWXG 00070 mask for group permissions
S_IRGRP 00040 group has read permission S_IWGRP 00020 group
has write permission S_IXGRP 00010 group has execute
permission S_IRWXO 00007 mask for permissions for others
(not in group)</p>

<p>S_IROTH 00004 others have read permission S_IWOTH 00002
others have write permission S_IXOTH 00001 others have
execute permission</p>

<p>The set-group-ID bit (S_ISGID) has several special uses.
For a direc- tory it indicates that BSD semantics is to be
used for that directory: files created there inherit their
group ID from the directory, not from the effective group ID
of the creating process, and directories created there will
also get the S_ISGID bit set. For a file that does not have
the group execution bit (S_IXGRP) set, the set-group-ID bit
indicates mandatory file/record locking.</p>

<p>The sticky bit (S_ISVTX) on a directory means that a
file in that directory can be renamed or deleted only by the
owner of the file, by the owner of the directory, and by a
privileged process.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, zero is returned. On error, -1
is returned, and errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS EACCES Search permission is denied for one of the
directories in the path prefix of path. (See also
path_resolution(7).)</p>

<p>EBADF fd is bad.</p>

<p>EFAULT Bad address.</p>

<p>ELOOP Too many symbolic links encountered while
traversing the path.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG File name too long.</p>

<p>ENOENT A component of path does not exist, or path is an
empty string.</p>

<p>ENOMEM Out of memory (i.e., kernel memory).</p>

<p>ENOTDIR A component of the path prefix of path is not a
directory.</p>

<p>EOVERFLOW (stat()) path refers to a file whose size
cannot be represented in the type off_t. This can occur when
an application compiled on a 32-bit platform without
-D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 calls stat() on a file whose size
exceeds (2&lt;&lt;31)-1 bits.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO These system calls conform to SVr4,
4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>Use of the st_blocks and st_blksize fields may be less
portable. (They were introduced in BSD. The interpretation
differs between systems, and possibly on a single system
when NFS mounts are involved.)</p>

<p>POSIX does not describe the S_IFMT, S_IFSOCK, S_IFLNK,
S_IFREG, S_IFBLK, S_IFDIR, S_IFCHR, S_IFIFO, S_ISVTX bits,
but instead demands the use of the macros S_ISDIR(), etc.
The S_ISLNK() and S_ISSOCK() macros are not in POSIX.1-1996,
but both are present in POSIX.1-2001; the former is from
SVID 4, the latter from SUSv2.</p>

<p>Unix V7 (and later systems) had S_IREAD, S_IWRITE,
S_IEXEC, where POSIX prescribes the synonyms S_IRUSR,
S_IWUSR, S_IXUSR.</p>

<p>A sticky command appeared in Version 32V AT&amp;T
UNIX.</p>

<p>NOTES Since kernel 2.5.48, the stat structure supports
nanosecond resolution for the three file timestamp fields.
Glibc exposes the nanosecond com- ponent of each field using
names either of the form st_atim.tv_nsec, if the _BSD_SOURCE
or _SVID_SOURCE feature test macro is defined, or of the
form st_atimensec, if neither of these macros is defined. On
file systems that do not support sub-second timestamps,
these nanosecond fields are returned with the value 0.</p>

<p>On Linux, lstat() will generally not trigger automounter
action, whereas stat() will.</p>

<p>For most files under the /proc directory, stat() does
not return the file size in the st_size field; instead the
field is returned with the value 0.</p>

<p>Underlying kernel interface Over time, increases in the
size of the stat structure have led to three successive
versions of stat(): sys_stat() (slot __NR_oldstat),
sys_newstat() (slot __NR_stat), and sys_stat64() (new in
kernel 2.4; slot __NR_stat64). The glibc stat() wrapper
function hides these details from applications, invoking the
most recent version of the sys- tem call provided by the
kernel, and repacking the returned information if required
for old binaries. Similar remarks apply for fstat() and
lstat().</p>

<p>EXAMPLE The following program calls stat() and displays
selected fields in the returned stat structure.</p>

<p>#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; #include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;
#include &lt;time.h&gt; #include &lt;stdio.h&gt; #include
&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</p>

<p>int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { struct stat sb;</p>

<p>if (argc != 2) { fprintf(stderr, &quot;Usage: %s
&lt;pathname&gt;0, argv[0]); exit(EXIT_FAILURE); }</p>

<p>if (stat(argv[1], &amp;sb) == -1) {
perror(&quot;stat&quot;); exit(EXIT_SUCCESS); }</p>

<p>printf(&quot;File type: &quot;);</p>

<p>switch (sb.st_mode &amp; S_IFMT) { case S_IFBLK:
printf(&quot;block device0); break; case S_IFCHR:
printf(&quot;character device0); break; case S_IFDIR:
printf(&quot;directory0); break; case S_IFIFO:
printf(&quot;FIFO/pipe0); break; case S_IFLNK:
printf(&quot;symlink0); break; case S_IFREG:
printf(&quot;regular file0); break; case S_IFSOCK:
printf(&quot;socket0); break; default:
printf(&quot;unknown?0); break; }</p>

<p>printf(&quot;I-node number: %ld0, (long) sb.st_ino);</p>

<p>printf(&quot;Mode: %lo (octal)0, (unsigned long)
sb.st_mode);</p>

<p>printf(&quot;Link count: %ld0, (long) sb.st_nlink);
printf(&quot;Ownership: UID=%ld GID=%ld0, (long) sb.st_uid,
(long) sb.st_gid);</p>

<p>printf(&quot;Preferred I/O block size: %ld bytes0,
(long) sb.st_blksize); printf(&quot;File size: %lld bytes0,
(long long) sb.st_size); printf(&quot;Blocks allocated:
%lld0, (long long) sb.st_blocks);</p>

<p>printf(&quot;Last status change: %s&quot;,
ctime(&amp;sb.st_ctime)); printf(&quot;Last file access:
%s&quot;, ctime(&amp;sb.st_atime)); printf(&quot;Last file
modification: %s&quot;, ctime(&amp;sb.st_mtime));</p>

<p>exit(EXIT_SUCCESS); }</p>
