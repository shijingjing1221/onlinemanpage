<p>FLUSH_WORKQUEUE(9) Driver Basics FLUSH_WORKQUEUE(9)</p>

<p>NAME flush_workqueue - ensure that any scheduled work
has run to completion.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS void flush_workqueue(struct workqueue_struct *
wq);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS wq workqueue to flush</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Forces execution of the workqueue and blocks
until its completion. This is typically used in driver
shutdown handlers.</p>

<p>We sleep until all works which were queued on entry have
been handled, but we are not livelocked by new incoming
ones.</p>

<p>This function used to run the workqueues itself. Now we
just wait for the helper threads to do it.</p>
