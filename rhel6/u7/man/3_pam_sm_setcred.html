<p>PAM_SM_SETCRED(3) Linux-PAM Manual PAM_SM_SETCRED(3)</p>

<p>NAME pam_sm_setcred - PAM service function to alter
credentials</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #define PAM_SM_AUTH</p>

<p>#include &lt;security/pam_modules.h&gt;</p>

<p>PAM_EXTERN int pam_sm_setcred(pam_handle_t *pamh, int
flags, int argc, const char **argv);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pam_sm_setcred function is the service
module&acute;s implementation of the pam_setcred(3)
interface.</p>

<p>This function performs the task of altering the
credentials of the user with respect to the corresponding
authorization scheme. Generally, an authentication module
may have access to more information about a user than their
authentication token. This function is used to make such
information available to the application. It should only be
called after the user has been authenticated but before a
session has been established.</p>

<p>Valid flags, which may be logically OR&acute;d with
PAM_SILENT, are:</p>

<p>PAM_SILENT Do not emit any messages.</p>

<p>PAM_ESTABLISH_CRED Initialize the credentials for the
user.</p>

<p>PAM_DELETE_CRED Delete the credentials associated with
the authentication service.</p>

<p>PAM_REINITIALIZE_CRED Reinitialize the user
credentials.</p>

<p>PAM_REFRESH_CRED Extend the lifetime of the user
credentials.</p>

<p>The way the auth stack is navigated in order to evaluate
the pam_setcred() function call, independent of the
pam_sm_setcred() return codes, is exactly the same way that
it was navigated when evaluating the pam_authenticate()
library call. Typically, if a stack entry was ignored in
evaluating pam_authenticate(), it will be ignored when
libpam evaluates the pam_setcred() function call. Otherwise,
the return codes from each module specific pam_sm_setcred()
call are treated as required.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUES PAM_CRED_UNAVAIL This module cannot
retrieve the user&acute;s credentials.</p>

<p>PAM_CRED_EXPIRED The user&acute;s credentials have
expired.</p>

<p>PAM_CRED_ERR This module was unable to set the
credentials of the user.</p>

<p>PAM_SUCCESS The user credential was successfully
set.</p>

<p>PAM_USER_UNKNOWN The user is not known to this
authentication module.</p>

<p>These, non-PAM_SUCCESS, return values will typically
lead to the credential stack failing. The first such error
will dominate in the return value of pam_setcred().</p>
