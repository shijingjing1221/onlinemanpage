<p>NAME smbpasswd - change a user&rsquo;s SMB password</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS smbpasswd [-a] [-c &lt;config file&gt;] [-x]
[-d] [-e] [-D debuglevel] [-n] [-r &lt;remote machine&gt;]
[-R &lt;name resolve order&gt;] [-m] [-U
username[%password]] [-h] [-s] [-w pass] [-W] [-i] [-L]
[username]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This tool is part of the samba(7) suite.</p>

<p>The smbpasswd program has several different functions,
depending on whether it is run by the root user or not. When
run as a normal user it allows the user to change the
password used for their SMB sessions on any machines that
store SMB passwords.</p>

<p>By default (when run with no arguments) it will attempt
to change the current user&rsquo;s SMB password on the local
machine. This is similar to the way the passwd(1) program
works. smbpasswd differs from how the passwd program works
however in that it is not setuid root but works in a
client-server mode and communicates with a locally running
smbd(8). As a consequence in order for this to succeed the
smbd daemon must be running on the local machine. On a UNIX
machine the encrypted SMB passwords are usually stored in
the smbpasswd(5) file.</p>

<p>When run by an ordinary user with no options, smbpasswd
will prompt them for their old SMB password and then ask
them for their new password twice, to ensure that the new
password was typed correctly. No passwords will be echoed on
the screen whilst being typed. If you have a blank SMB
password (specified by the string &quot;NO PASSWORD&quot; in
the smbpasswd file) then just press the &lt;Enter&gt; key
when asked for your old password.</p>

<p>smbpasswd can also be used by a normal user to change
their SMB password on remote machines, such as Windows NT
Primary Domain Controllers. See the (-r) and -U options
below.</p>

<p>When run by root, smbpasswd allows new users to be added
and deleted in the smbpasswd file, as well as allows changes
to the attributes of the user in this file to be made. When
run by root, smbpasswd accesses the local smbpasswd file
directly, thus enabling changes to be made even if smbd is
not running.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -a This option specifies that the username
following should be added to the local smbpasswd file, with
the new password typed (type &lt;Enter&gt; for the old
password). This option is ignored if the username following
already exists in the smbpasswd file and it is treated like
a regular change password command. Note that the default
passdb backends require the user to already exist in the
system password file (usually /etc/passwd), else the request
to add the user will fail.</p>

<p>This option is only available when running smbpasswd as
root.</p>

<p>-c This option can be used to specify the path and file
name of the smb.conf configuration file when it is important
to use other than the default file and / or location.</p>

<p>-x This option specifies that the username following
should be deleted from the local smbpasswd file.</p>

<p>This option is only available when running smbpasswd as
root.</p>

<p>-d This option specifies that the username following
should be disabled in the local smbpasswd file. This is done
by writing a &rsquo;D&rsquo; flag into the account control
space in the smbpasswd file. Once this is done all attempts
to authenticate via SMB using this username will fail.</p>

<p>If the smbpasswd file is in the &rsquo;old&rsquo; format
(pre-Samba 2.0 format) there is no space in the user&rsquo;s
password entry to write this information and the command
will FAIL. See smbpasswd(5) for details on the
&rsquo;old&rsquo; and new password file formats.</p>

<p>This option is only available when running smbpasswd as
root.</p>

<p>-e This option specifies that the username following
should be enabled in the local smbpasswd file, if the
account was previously disabled. If the account was not
disabled this option has no effect. Once the account is
enabled then the user will be able to authenticate via SMB
once again.</p>

<p>If the smbpasswd file is in the &rsquo;old&rsquo;
format, then smbpasswd will FAIL to enable the account. See
smbpasswd(5) for details on the &rsquo;old&rsquo; and new
password file formats.</p>

<p>This option is only available when running smbpasswd as
root.</p>

<p>-D debuglevel debuglevel is an integer from 0 to 10. The
default value if this parameter is not specified is
zero.</p>

<p>The higher this value, the more detail will be logged to
the log files about the activities of smbpasswd. At level 0,
only critical errors and serious warnings will be
logged.</p>

<p>Levels above 1 will generate considerable amounts of log
data, and should only be used when investigating a problem.
Levels above 3 are designed for use only by developers and
generate HUGE amounts of log data, most of which is
extremely cryptic.</p>

<p>-n This option specifies that the username following
should have their password set to null (i.e. a blank
password) in the local smbpasswd file. This is done by
writing the string &quot;NO PASSWORD&quot; as the first part
of the first password stored in the smbpasswd file.</p>

<p>Note that to allow users to logon to a Samba server once
the password has been set to &quot;NO PASSWORD&quot; in the
smbpasswd file the administrator must set the following
parameter in the [global] section of the smb.conf file :</p>

<p>null passwords = yes</p>

<p>This option is only available when running smbpasswd as
root.</p>

<p>-r remote machine name This option allows a user to
specify what machine they wish to change their password on.
Without this parameter smbpasswd defaults to the local host.
The remote machine name is the NetBIOS name of the SMB/CIFS
server to contact to attempt the password change. This name
is resolved into an IP address using the standard name
resolution mechanism in all programs of the Samba suite. See
the -R name resolve order parameter for details on changing
this resolving mechanism.</p>

<p>The username whose password is changed is that of the
current UNIX logged on user. See the -U username parameter
for details on changing the password for a different
username.</p>

<p>Note that if changing a Windows NT Domain password the
remote machine specified must be the Primary Domain
Controller for the domain (Backup Domain Controllers only
have a read-only copy of the user account database and will
not allow the password change).</p>

<p>Note that Windows 95/98 do not have a real password
database so it is not possible to change passwords
specifying a Win95/98 machine as remote machine target.</p>

<p>-R name resolve order This option allows the user of
smbpasswd to determine what name resolution services to use
when looking up the NetBIOS name of the host being connected
to.</p>

<p>The options are :&quot;lmhosts&quot;, &quot;host&quot;,
&quot;wins&quot; and &quot;bcast&quot;. They cause names to
be resolved as follows:</p>

<p>&middot; lmhosts: Lookup an IP address in the Samba
lmhosts file. If the line in lmhosts has no name type
attached to the NetBIOS name (see the lmhosts(5) for
details) then any name type matches for lookup.</p>

<p>&middot; host: Do a standard host name to IP address
resolution, using the system /etc/hosts, NIS, or DNS
lookups. This method of name resolution is operating system
depended for instance on IRIX or Solaris this may be
controlled by the /etc/nsswitch.conf file). Note that this
method is only used if the NetBIOS name type being queried
is the 0x20 (server) name type, otherwise it is ignored.</p>

<p>&middot; wins: Query a name with the IP address listed
in the wins server parameter. If no WINS server has been
specified this method will be ignored.</p>

<p>&middot; bcast: Do a broadcast on each of the known
local interfaces listed in the interfaces parameter. This is
the least reliable of the name resolution methods as it
depends on the target host being on a locally connected
subnet.</p>

<p>The default order is lmhosts, host, wins, bcast and
without this parameter or any entry in the smb.conf(5) file
the name resolution methods will be attempted in this
order.</p>

<p>-m This option tells smbpasswd that the account being
changed is a MACHINE account. Currently this is used when
Samba is being used as an NT Primary Domain Controller.</p>

<p>This option is only available when running smbpasswd as
root.</p>

<p>-U username This option may only be used in conjunction
with the -r option. When changing a password on a remote
machine it allows the user to specify the user name on that
machine whose password will be changed. It is present to
allow users who have different user names on different
systems to change these passwords.</p>

<p>-h This option prints the help string for smbpasswd,
selecting the correct one for running as root or as an
ordinary user.</p>

<p>-s This option causes smbpasswd to be silent (i.e. not
issue prompts) and to read its old and new passwords from
standard input, rather than from /dev/tty (like the
passwd(1) program does). This option is to aid people
writing scripts to drive smbpasswd</p>

<p>-w password This parameter is only available if Samba
has been compiled with LDAP support. The -w switch is used
to specify the password to be used with the ldap admin dn.
Note that the password is stored in the secrets.tdb and is
keyed off of the admin&rsquo;s DN. This means that if the
value of ldap admin dn ever changes, the password will need
to be manually updated as well.</p>

<p>-W NOTE: This option is same as &quot;-w&quot; except
that the password should be entered using stdin.</p>

<p>This parameter is only available if Samba has been
compiled with LDAP support. The -W switch is used to specify
the password to be used with the ldap admin dn. Note that
the password is stored in the secrets.tdb and is keyed off
of the admin&rsquo;s DN. This means that if the value of
ldap admin dn ever changes, the password will need to be
manually updated as well.</p>

<p>-i This option tells smbpasswd that the account being
changed is an interdomain trust account. Currently this is
used when Samba is being used as an NT Primary Domain
Controller. The account contains the info about another
trusted domain.</p>

<p>This option is only available when running smbpasswd as
root.</p>

<p>-L Run in local mode.</p>

<p>username This specifies the username for all of the root
only options to operate on. Only root can specify this
parameter as only root has the permission needed to modify
attributes directly in the local smbpasswd file.</p>

<p>NOTES Since smbpasswd works in client-server mode
communicating with a local smbd for a non-root user then the
smbd daemon must be running for this to work. A common
problem is to add a restriction to the hosts that may access
the smbd running on the local machine by specifying either
allow hosts or deny hosts entry in the smb.conf(5) file and
neglecting to allow &quot;localhost&quot; access to the
smbd.</p>

<p>In addition, the smbpasswd command is only useful if
Samba has been set up to use encrypted passwords.</p>

<p>VERSION This man page is correct for version 3 of the
Samba suite.</p>

<p>AUTHOR The original Samba software and related utilities
were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by
the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way
the Linux kernel is developed.</p>

<p>The original Samba man pages were written by Karl Auer.
The man page sources were converted to YODL format (another
excellent piece of Open Source software, available at
ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/) and updated for the Samba
2.0 release by Jeremy Allison. The conversion to DocBook for
Samba 2.2 was done by Gerald Carter. The conversion to
DocBook XML 4.2 for Samba 3.0 was done by Alexander
Bokovoy.</p>
