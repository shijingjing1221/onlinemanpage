<p>NAME pmdaxfs - XFS filesystem performance metrics domain
agent (PMDA)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/xfs/pmdaxfs [-d domain] [-l
logfile]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pmdaxfs is a Performance Metrics Domain
Agent (PMDA) which extracts performance metrics describing
the state of the XFS filesystem from the Linux kernel.</p>

<p>The xfs PMDA exports metrics that measure information
about metadata buffer usage, the journal, btree operations,
inode operations, extended attributes, directories, quotas,
read and write operation counts and of course
throughput.</p>

<p>The PMDA provides a facility to reset the values of all
counters to zero using pmstore(1) with the xfs.control.reset
metric.</p>

<p>A brief description of the pmdaxfs command line options
follows:</p>

<p>-d It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics
domain num- ber specified here is unique and consistent.
That is, domain should be different for every PMDA on the
one host, and the same domain number should be used for the
same PMDA on all hosts.</p>

<p>-l Location of the log file. By default, a log file
named xfs.log is written in the current directory of pmcd(1)
when pmdaxfs is started, i.e. $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd. If the log
file cannot be cre- ated or is not writable, output is
written to the standard error instead.</p>

<p>INSTALLATION The xfs PMDA is installed and available by
default on Linux. If you want to undo the installation, do
the following as root:</p>

<p># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/xfs # ./Remove</p>

<p>If you want to establish access to the names, help text
and values for the XFS performance metrics once more, after
removal, do the following as root:</p>

<p># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/xfs # ./Install</p>

<p>pmdaxfs is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be
executed directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify
pmcd(1) when the agent is installed or removed.</p>

<p>FILES $PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH command line options used to
launch pmdaxfs $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/xfs/help default help text
file for the xfs metrics $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/xfs/Install
installation script for the pmdaxfs agent
$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/xfs/Remove undo installation script for the
pmdaxfs agent $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/xfs.log default log file for
error messages and other information from pmdaxfs</p>

<p>PCP ENVIRONMENT Environment variables with the prefix
PCP_ are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP. On each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in pcp.conf(5).</p>

and pcp.env(5).</p>
