<p>sha512hmac(8) System Administrator s Manual
sha512hmac(8)</p>

<p>NAME sha512hmac - compute and check HMAC values</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sha512hmac [OPTIONS] [-u | -k keyfile | -K key]
[-c file [-q] | file [...] ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sha512hmac command can compute and/or
verify HMAC and unkeyed checksum values for the contents of
files. Variations such as sha384hmac, sha256hmac, and
sha1hmac all operate similarly except that they use
different digest algorithms.</p>

<p>SELF-TEST As a safety measure, the tool will always
attempt to verify a previ- ously- computed HMAC over itself
with the contents of a second file (sha512hmac.hmac for
sha512hmac, and a similarly-named file for each variation)
before processing any other files, and will exit with an
error if the second file either cannot be read or does not
match the computed value.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -c Check that the HMAC values and names listed
in the specified file(s) are correct for the files which are
available. The for- mat of the files should match the output
which the tool produces when computing the values: a
hex-encoded HMAC value and then a filename, separated by
whitespace.</p>

<p>-q Suppress any output when checking values.</p>

<p>-d cfgdir Specify the configuration directory to be used
by the NSS library. The default location is
/etc/pki/nssdb.</p>

<p>-h algorithm Generate the HMAC value using a non-default
hashing algorithm. The default is determined by the name
used to invoke the tool (sha1hmac, sha256hmac, etc.). If no
default can be derived this way, the default setting will be
sha512. Specify help or another invalid value to obtain a
list of recognized algorithms.</p>

<p>-u Generate an unkeyed checksum instead of an HMAC. The
output produced by the tool should then be comparable to
that of sha1sum and related tools.</p>

<p>-k filename Use the contents of the specified file as
the secret key used in computing the HMAC values. If no key
file or text is specified, a hard-coded default value is
used. This option should always be used.</p>

<p>-K text Use the text of the argument as the secret key
used in computing the HMAC values. If no key file or text is
specified, a hard- coded default value is used.</p>

<p>-b Process file contents in binary mode, marking output
as such by prefixing filenames with *. This option is not
expected to have any other meaningful effect.</p>

<p>-t bits Truncate HMAC values to a given length when
computing or verify- ing them.</p>

<p>-S Generate an HMAC over the tool itself and output it
on standard out. This is a bootstrapping option which is not
expected to be used.</p>

<p>-P Attempt to pass all input files through prelink -y
before pro- cessing their contents. The tool always attempts
to do so when computing or performing a self-check.</p>
