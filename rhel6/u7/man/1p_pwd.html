<p>PWD(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual PWD(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME pwd - return working directory name</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pwd [-L | -P ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pwd utility shall write to standard
output an absolute pathname of the current working
directory, which does not contain the filenames dot or
dot-dot.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The pwd utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>The following options shall be supported by the
implementation:</p>

<p>-L If the PWD environment variable contains an absolute
pathname of the current directory that does not contain the
filenames dot or dot-dot, pwd shall write this pathname to
standard output. Oth- erwise, the -L option shall behave as
the -P option.</p>

<p>-P The absolute pathname written shall not contain
filenames that, in the context of the pathname, refer to
files of type symbolic link.</p>

<p>If both -L and -P are specified, the last one shall
apply. If neither -L nor -P is specified, the pwd utility
shall behave as if -L had been specified.</p>

<p>OPERANDS None.</p>

<p>STDIN Not used.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of pwd:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>PWD If the -P option is in effect, this variable shall
be set to an absolute pathname of the current working
directory that does not contain any components that specify
symbolic links, does not contain any components that are
dot, and does not contain any components that are dot-dot.
If an application sets or unsets the value of PWD, the
behavior of pwd is unspecified.</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT The pwd utility output is an absolute pathname of
the current working directory:</p>

<p>&quot;%n&quot;, &lt;directory pathname&gt;</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 Successful completion.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS If an error is detected, output
shall not be written to standard out- put, a diagnostic
message shall be written to standard error, and the exit
status is not zero.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE Some implementations have historically
provided pwd as a shell special built-in command.</p>

<p>In most utilities, if an error occurs, partial output
may be written to standard output. This does not happen in
historical implementations of pwd. Because pwd is frequently
used in historical shell scripts without checking the exit
status, it is important that the historical behavior is
required here; therefore, the CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS section
specif- ically disallows any partial output being written to
standard output.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
