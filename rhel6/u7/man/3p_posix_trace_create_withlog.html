<p>POSIX_TRACE_CREATE(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
POSIX_TRACE_CREATE(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME posix_trace_create, posix_trace_create_withlog,
posix_trace_flush, posix_trace_shutdown - trace stream
initialization, flush, and shutdown from a process
(TRACING)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; #include
&lt;trace.h&gt;</p>

<p>int posix_trace_create(pid_t pid, const trace_attr_t
*restrict attr, trace_id_t *restrict trid);</p>

<p>int posix_trace_create_withlog(pid_t pid, const
trace_attr_t *restrict attr, int file_desc, trace_id_t
*restrict trid); int posix_trace_flush(trace_id_t trid);</p>

<p>int posix_trace_shutdown(trace_id_t trid);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The posix_trace_create() function shall
create an active trace stream. It allocates all the
resources needed by the trace stream being created for
tracing the process specified by pid in accordance with the
attr argument. The attr argument represents the initial
attributes of the trace stream and shall have been
initialized by the function posix_trace_attr_init() prior to
the posix_trace_create() call. If the argument attr is NULL,
the default attributes shall be used. The attr attributes
object shall be manipulated through a set of functions
described in the posix_trace_attr family of functions. If
the attributes of the object pointed to by attr are modified
later, the attributes of the trace stream shall not be
affected. The creation-time attribute of the newly created
trace stream shall be set to the value of the system clock,
if the Timers option is not supported, or to the value of
the CLOCK_REALTIME clock, if the Timers option is
supported.</p>

<p>The pid argument represents the target process to be
traced. If the process executing this function does not have
appropriate privileges to trace the process identified by
pid, an error shall be returned. If the pid argument is
zero, the calling process shall be traced.</p>

<p>The posix_trace_create() function shall store the trace
stream identi- fier of the new trace stream in the object
pointed to by the trid argu- ment. This trace stream
identifier shall be used in subsequent calls to control
tracing. The trid argument may only be used by the following
functions:</p>

<p>posix_trace_clear() posix_trace_getnext_event()
posix_trace_eventid_equal() posix_trace_shutdown()
posix_trace_eventid_get_name() posix_trace_start()
posix_trace_eventtypelist_getnext_id() posix_trace_stop()
posix_trace_eventtypelist_rewind()
posix_trace_timedgetnext_event() posix_trace_get_attr()
posix_trace_trid_eventid_open() posix_trace_get_status()
posix_trace_trygetnext_event()</p>

<p>If the Trace Event Filter option is supported, the
following additional functions may use the trid
argument:</p>

<p>posix_trace_get_filter() posix_trace_set_filter()</p>

<p>In particular, notice that the operations normally used
by a trace ana- lyzer process, such as posix_trace_rewind()
or posix_trace_close(), cannot be invoked using the trace
stream identifier returned by the posix_trace_create()
function.</p>

<p>A trace stream shall be created in a suspended state. If
the Trace Event Filter option is supported, its trace event
type filter shall be empty.</p>

<p>The posix_trace_create() function may be called multiple
times from the same or different processes, with the
system-wide limit indicated by the runtime invariant value
{TRACE_SYS_MAX}, which has the minimum value
{_POSIX_TRACE_SYS_MAX}.</p>

<p>The trace stream identifier returned by the
posix_trace_create() func- tion in the argument pointed to
by trid is valid only in the process that made the function
call. If it is used from another process, that is a child
process, in functions defined in IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, these
functions shall return with the error [EINVAL].</p>

<p>The posix_trace_create_withlog() function shall be
equivalent to posix_trace_create(), except that it
associates a trace log with this stream. The file_desc
argument shall be the file descriptor designating the trace
log destination. The function shall fail if this file
descriptor refers to a file with a file type that is not
compatible with the log policy associated with the trace
log. The list of the appropriate file types that are
compatible with each log policy is
implementation-defined.</p>

<p>The posix_trace_create_withlog() function shall return
in the parameter pointed to by trid the trace stream
identifier, which uniquely identi- fies the newly created
trace stream, and shall be used in subsequent calls to
control tracing. The trid argument may only be used by the
following functions:</p>

<p>posix_trace_clear() posix_trace_getnext_event()
posix_trace_eventid_equal() posix_trace_shutdown()
posix_trace_eventid_get_name() posix_trace_start()
posix_trace_eventtypelist_getnext_id() posix_trace_stop()
posix_trace_eventtypelist_rewind()
posix_trace_timedgetnext_event() posix_trace_flush()
posix_trace_trid_eventid_open() posix_trace_get_attr()
posix_trace_trygetnext_event() posix_trace_get_status()</p>

<p>If the Trace Event Filter option is supported, the
following additional functions may use the trid
argument:</p>

<p>posix_trace_get_filter() posix_trace_set_filter()</p>

<p>In particular, notice that the operations normally used
by a trace ana- lyzer process, such as posix_trace_rewind()
or posix_trace_close(), cannot be invoked using the trace
stream identifier returned by the
posix_trace_create_withlog() function.</p>

<p>The posix_trace_flush() function shall initiate a flush
operation which copies the contents of the trace stream
identified by the argument trid into the trace log
associated with the trace stream at the creation time. If no
trace log has been associated with the trace stream pointed
to by trid, this function shall return an error. The
termination of the flush operation can be polled by the
posix_trace_get_status() function. During the flush
operation, it shall be possible to trace new trace events up
to the point when the trace stream becomes full. After
flush- ing is completed, the space used by the flushed trace
events shall be available for tracing new trace events.</p>

<p>If flushing the trace stream causes the resulting trace
log to become full, the trace log full policy shall be
applied. If the trace log- full-policy attribute is set, the
following occurs:</p>

<p>POSIX_TRACE_UNTIL_FULL</p>

<p>The trace events that have not yet been flushed shall be
dis- carded.</p>

<p>POSIX_TRACE_LOOP</p>

<p>The trace events that have not yet been flushed shall be
written to the beginning of the trace log, overwriting
previous trace events stored there.</p>

<p>POSIX_TRACE_APPEND</p>

<p>The trace events that have not yet been flushed shall be
appended to the trace log.</p>

<p>The posix_trace_shutdown() function shall stop the
tracing of trace events in the trace stream identified by
trid, as if posix_trace_stop() had been invoked. The
posix_trace_shutdown() function shall free all the resources
associated with the trace stream.</p>

<p>The posix_trace_shutdown() function shall not return
until all the resources associated with the trace stream
have been freed. When the posix_trace_shutdown() function
returns, the trid argument becomes an invalid trace stream
identifier. A call to this function shall uncondi- tionally
deallocate the resources regardless of whether all trace
events have been retrieved by the analyzer process. Any
thread blocked on one of the trace_getnext_event() functions
(which specified this trid) before this call is unblocked
with the error [EINVAL].</p>

<p>If the process exits, invokes a member of the exec
family of functions, or is terminated, the trace streams
that the process had created and that have not yet been shut
down, shall be automatically shut down as if an explicit
call were made to the posix_trace_shutdown() function.</p>

<p>For an active trace stream with log, when the
posix_trace_shutdown() function is called, all trace events
that have not yet been flushed to the trace log shall be
flushed, as in the posix_trace_flush() function, and the
trace log shall be closed.</p>

<p>When a trace log is closed, all the information that may
be retrieved later from the trace log through the trace
interface shall have been written to the trace log. This
information includes the trace attributes, the list of trace
event types (with the mapping between trace event names and
trace event type identifiers), and the trace sta- tus.</p>

<p>In addition, unspecified information shall be written to
the trace log to allow detection of a valid trace log during
the posix_trace_open() operation.</p>

<p>The posix_trace_shutdown() function shall not return
until all trace events have been flushed.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, these functions
shall return a value of zero. Otherwise, they shall return
the corresponding error number.</p>

<p>The posix_trace_create() and
posix_trace_create_withlog() functions store the trace
stream identifier value in the object pointed to by trid, if
successful.</p>

<p>ERRORS The posix_trace_create() and
posix_trace_create_withlog() functions shall fail if:</p>

<p>EAGAIN No more trace streams can be started now.
{TRACE_SYS_MAX} has been exceeded.</p>

<p>EINTR The operation was interrupted by a signal. No
trace stream was created.</p>

<p>EINVAL One or more of the trace parameters specified by
the attr param- eter is invalid.</p>

<p>ENOMEM The implementation does not currently have
sufficient memory to create the trace stream with the
specified parameters.</p>

<p>EPERM The caller does not have appropriate privilege to
trace the pro- cess specified by pid.</p>

<p>ESRCH The pid argument does not refer to an existing
process.</p>

<p>The posix_trace_create_withlog() function shall fail
if:</p>

<p>EBADF The file_desc argument is not a valid file
descriptor open for writing.</p>

<p>EINVAL The file_desc argument refers to a file with a
file type that does not support the log policy associated
with the trace log.</p>

<p>ENOSPC No space left on device. The device corresponding
to the argu- ment file_desc does not contain the space
required to create this trace log.</p>

<p>The posix_trace_flush() and posix_trace_shutdown()
functions shall fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The value of the trid argument does not
correspond to an active trace stream with log.</p>

<p>EFBIG The trace log file has attempted to exceed an
implementation- defined maximum file size.</p>

<p>ENOSPC No space left on device.</p>
