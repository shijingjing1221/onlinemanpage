<p>NAME git-describe - Show the most recent tag that is
reachable from a commit</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS git describe [--all] [--tags] [--contains]
[--abbrev=&lt;n&gt;] &lt;committish&gt;... git describe
[--all] [--tags] [--contains] [--abbrev=&lt;n&gt;]
--dirty[=&lt;mark&gt;]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The command finds the most recent tag that
is reachable from a commit. If the tag points to the commit,
then only the tag is shown. Otherwise, it suffixes the tag
name with the number of additional commits on top of the
tagged object and the abbreviated object name of the most
recent commit.</p>

<p>By default (without --all or --tags) git describe only
shows annotated tags. For more information about creating
annotated tags see the -a and -s options to git-tag(1).</p>

<p>OPTIONS &lt;committish&gt;... Committish object names to
describe.</p>

<p>--dirty[=&lt;mark&gt;] Describe the working tree. It
means describe HEAD and appends &lt;mark&gt; (-dirty by
default) if the working tree is dirty.</p>

<p>--all Instead of using only the annotated tags, use any
ref found in .git/refs/. This option enables matching any
known branch, remote branch, or lightweight tag.</p>

<p>--tags Instead of using only the annotated tags, use any
tag found in .git/refs/tags. This option enables matching a
lightweight (non-annotated) tag.</p>

<p>--contains Instead of finding the tag that predates the
commit, find the tag that comes after the commit, and thus
contains it. Automatically implies --tags.</p>

<p>--abbrev=&lt;n&gt; Instead of using the default 7
hexadecimal digits as the abbreviated object name, use
&lt;n&gt; digits, or as many digits as needed to form a
unique object name. An &lt;n&gt; of 0 will suppress long
format, only showing the closest tag.</p>

<p>--candidates=&lt;n&gt; Instead of considering only the
10 most recent tags as candidates to describe the input
committish consider up to &lt;n&gt; candidates. Increasing
&lt;n&gt; above 10 will take slightly longer but may produce
a more accurate result. An &lt;n&gt; of 0 will cause only
exact matches to be output.</p>

<p>--exact-match Only output exact matches (a tag directly
references the supplied commit). This is a synonym for
--candidates=0.</p>

<p>--debug Verbosely display information about the
searching strategy being employed to standard error. The tag
name will still be printed to standard out.</p>

<p>--long Always output the long format (the tag, the
number of commits and the abbreviated commit name) even when
it matches a tag. This is useful when you want to see parts
of the commit object name in &quot;describe&quot; output,
even when the commit in question happens to be a tagged
version. Instead of just emitting the tag name, it will
describe such a commit as v1.2-0-gdeadbee (0th commit since
tag v1.2 that points at object deadbee....).</p>

<p>--match &lt;pattern&gt; Only consider tags matching the
given pattern (can be used to avoid leaking private tags
made from the repository).</p>

<p>--always Show uniquely abbreviated commit object as
fallback.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES With something like git.git current tree, I
get:</p>

<p>[torvalds@g5 git]$ git describe parent
v1.0.4-14-g2414721</p>

<p>i.e. the current head of my &quot;parent&quot; branch is
based on v1.0.4, but since it has a few commits on top of
that, describe has added the number of additional commits
(&quot;14&quot;) and an abbreviated object name for the
commit itself (&quot;2414721&quot;) at the end.</p>

<p>The number of additional commits is the number of
commits which would be displayed by &quot;git log
v1.0.4..parent&quot;. The hash suffix is &quot;-g&quot; +
7-char abbreviation for the tip commit of parent (which was
2414721b194453f058079d897d13c4e377f92dc6). The &quot;g&quot;
prefix stands for &quot;git&quot; and is used to allow
describing the version of a software depending on the SCM
the software is managed with. This is useful in an
environment where people may use different SCMs.</p>

<p>Doing a git describe on a tag-name will just show the
tag name:</p>

<p>[torvalds@g5 git]$ git describe v1.0.4 v1.0.4</p>

<p>With --all, the command can use branch heads as
references, so the output shows the reference path as
well:</p>

<p>[torvalds@g5 git]$ git describe --all --abbrev=4
v1.0.5^2 tags/v1.0.0-21-g975b</p>

<p>[torvalds@g5 git]$ git describe --all --abbrev=4 HEAD^
heads/lt/describe-7-g975b</p>

<p>With --abbrev set to 0, the command can be used to find
the closest tagname without any suffix:</p>

<p>[torvalds@g5 git]$ git describe --abbrev=0 v1.0.5^2
tags/v1.0.0</p>

<p>Note that the suffix you get if you type these commands
today may be longer than what Linus saw above when he ran
these commands, as your git repository may have new commits
whose object names begin with 975b that did not exist back
then, and &quot;-g975b&quot; suffix alone may not be
sufficient to disambiguate these commits.</p>

<p>SEARCH STRATEGY For each committish supplied, git
describe will first look for a tag which tags exactly that
commit. Annotated tags will always be preferred over
lightweight tags, and tags with newer dates will always be
preferred over tags with older dates. If an exact match is
found, its name will be output and searching will stop.</p>

<p>If an exact match was not found, git describe will walk
back through the commit history to locate an ancestor commit
which has been tagged. The ancestor s tag will be output
along with an abbreviation of the input committishs
SHA1.</p>

<p>If multiple tags were found during the walk then the tag
which has the fewest commits different from the input
committish will be selected and output. Here fewest commits
different is defined as the number of commits which would be
shown by git log tag..input will be the smallest number of
commits possible.</p>
