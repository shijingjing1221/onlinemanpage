<p>NAME nv - NVIDIA video driver</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS Section &quot;Device&quot; Identifier
&quot;devname&quot; Driver &quot;nv&quot; ... EndSection</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION nv is an Xorg driver for NVIDIA video cards.
The driver supports 2D acceleration and provides support for
the following framebuffer depths: 8, 15, 16 (except Riva128)
and 24. All visual types are supported for depth 8,
TrueColor and DirectColor visuals are supported for the
other depths with the exception of the Riva128 which only
supports TrueColor in the higher depths.</p>

<p>SUPPORTED HARDWARE The nv driver supports PCI,
PCI-Express and AGP video cards based on the following
NVIDIA chips:</p>

<p>RIVA 128 NV3</p>

<p>RIVA TNT NV4</p>

<p>RIVA TNT2 NV5</p>

<p>GeForce 256, Quadro NV10</p>

<p>GeForce2, Quadro2 NV11 &amp; NV15</p>

<p>GeForce3, Quadro DCC NV20</p>

<p>nForce, nForce2 NV1A, NV1F</p>

<p>GeForce4, Quadro4 NV17, NV18, NV25, NV28</p>

<p>GeForce FX, Quadro FX NV30, NV31, NV34, NV35, NV36,
NV37, NV38</p>

<p>GeForce 6XXX NV40, NV41, NV43, NV44, NV45, C51</p>

<p>GeForce 7XXX G70, G71, G72, G73, MCP6x</p>

<p>GeForce 8XXX, GeForce 9XXX, nForce 7, GeForce G, ION
G8x, G9x, GT21x, MCP7x</p>

<p>GeForce GTX GT200</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION DETAILS Please refer to xorg.conf(5) for
general configuration details. This section only covers
configuration details specific to this driver.</p>

<p>The driver auto-detects the chipset type and the amount
of video memory present for all chips.</p>

<p>The following driver Options are supported for pre-G80
hardware:</p>

<p>Option &quot;HWCursor&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Enable
or disable the HW cursor. Default: on.</p>

<p>Option &quot;NoAccel&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Disable
or enable acceleration. Default: acceleration is
enabled.</p>

<p>Option &quot;UseFBDev&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Enable
or disable use of an OS-specific fb interface (and is not
supported on all OSs). See fbdevhw(4) for further
information. Default: off.</p>

<p>Option &quot;CrtcNumber&quot; &quot;integer&quot; Many
graphics cards with NVIDIA chips have two video outputs. The
driver attempts to autodetect which one the monitor is con-
nected to. In the case that autodetection picks the wrong
one, this option may be used to force usage of a particular
output. The options are &quot;0&quot; or &quot;1&quot;.
Default: autodetected.</p>

<p>Option &quot;Dualhead&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Enables
simple VBE-based dual head mode. This sets the same
resolution on both outputs and lays them out side-by-side.
The screens will be panned together as one big metamode if
the vir- tual desktop is larger than both screens
combined.</p>

<p>Option &quot;FlatPanel&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; The
driver usually can autodetect the presence of a digital flat
panel. In the case that this fails, this option can be used
to force the driver to treat the attached device as a
digital flat panel. With this driver, a digital flat panel
will work only if it was POSTed by the BIOS, that is, the
computer must have booted to the panel. If you have a dual
head card you may also need to set the option CrtcNumber
described above. Default: autodetected.</p>

<p>Option &quot;FPDither&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Many
digital flat panels (particularly ones on laptops) have only
6 bits per component color resolution. This option tells the
driver to dither from 8 bits per component to 6 before the
flat panel truncates it. Default: off.</p>

<p>Option &quot;FPScale&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Supported
only on GeForce4 and newer chips, this option tells to the
driver to scale lower resolutions up to the flat panels
native resolution. Default: on.</p>

<p>Option &quot;Rotate&quot; &quot;CW&quot;</p>

<p>Option &quot;Rotate&quot; &quot;CCW&quot; Rotate the
display clockwise or counterclockwise. This mode is
unaccelerated. Default: no rotation.</p>

<p>Note: The Resize and Rotate extension will be disabled
if the Rotate &quot;CW&quot; or Rotate &quot;CCW&quot;
options are used.</p>

<p>Option &quot;Rotate&quot; &quot;RandR&quot; Enable
rotation of the screen using the Resize and Rotate exten-
sion. This mode is unaccelerated. Default: no rotation sup-
port.</p>

<p>Option &quot;ShadowFB&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Enable
or disable use of the shadow framebuffer layer. Default:
off.</p>

<p>The following driver Options are available for G80 and
higher:</p>

<p>Option &quot;HWCursor&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Enable
or disable the hardware cursor. Default: on.</p>

<p>Option &quot;NoAccel&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Disable
or enable acceleration. Default: acceleration is
enabled.</p>

<p>Option &quot;AccelMethod&quot; &quot;string&quot; Choose
acceleration architecture, either &quot;XAA&quot; or
&quot;EXA&quot;. XAA is the old but stable architecture. EXA
is newer and supports resizing the desktop larger than it
started out with RandR 1.2. If you choose to use EXA, you
might also consider setting Option
&quot;MigrationHeuristic&quot; &quot;greedy&quot; to improve
performance. Default: XAA.</p>

<p>Option &quot;FPDither&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Enable
or disable flat panel dithering by default. Dithering can
also be enabled or disabled using the RandR 1.2
&quot;dither&quot; output property. Default: off.</p>

<p>Option &quot;AllowDualLinkModes&quot;
&quot;boolean&quot; Allow validation of dual-link DVI modes.
Not all GPUs are con- figured at boot time to be able to
handle dual-link modes, so they are disabled by default.</p>

<p>The following RandR 1.2 properties are available for
flat panels on G80 and higher GPUs:</p>

<p>dither Enable or disable flat panel dithering. Valid
values: 0 (off), 1 (on).</p>

<p>scale Control how the image is scaled to fit the flat
panel. Note that some flat panels perform their own scaling,
overriding this option. &quot;off&quot; is not valid for
laptop flat panels (LVDS). Valid values: &quot;off&quot;,
&quot;aspect&quot;, &quot;fill&quot;, and
&quot;center&quot;. Default: &quot;aspect&quot;.</p>
