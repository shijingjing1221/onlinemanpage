<p>IPSEC_RANBITS(8) [FIXME: manual] IPSEC_RANBITS(8)</p>

<p>NAME ipsec_newhostkey - generate a new raw RSA
authentication key for a host</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ipsec newhostkey [[--configdiranssdbdir] |
[--password password]] [[--quiet] | [--verbose]] [--bits
bits] [--hostname hostname] --output filename</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION newhostkey outputs (into filename, which can
be &acute;-&acute; for standard output) an RSA private key
suitable for this host, in /etc/ipsec.secrets format (see
ipsec.secrets(5)) using the --quiet option per default.</p>

<p>The --output option is mandatory. The specified filename
is created under umask 077 if nonexistent; if it already
exists and is non-empty, a warning message about that is
sent to standard error, and the output is appended to the
file.</p>

<p>The --quiet option suppresses both the rsasigkey
narrative and the existing-file warning message.</p>

<p>When compiled with NSS support, --configdir specifies
the nss configuration directory where the certificate key,
and modsec databases reside. There is no default value,
though /etc/ipsec.d might be sensible choice.</p>

<p>When compiled with NSS support, --password specifies a
module authentication password that may be required if FIPS
mode is enabled</p>

<p>The --bits option specifies the number of bits in the
key; the current default is 2192 and we do not recommend use
of anything shorter unless unusual constraints demand
it.</p>

<p>The --hostname option is passed through to rsasigkey to
tell it what host name to label the output with (via its
--hostname option).</p>

<p>The output format is that of rsasigkey, with bracketing
added to complete the ipsec.secrets format. In the usual
case, where ipsec.secrets contains only the host&acirc;s own
private key, the output of newhostkey is sufficient as a
complete ipsec.secrets file.</p>

<p>FILES /dev/random, /dev/urandom</p>

<p>HISTORY Written for the Linux FreeS/WAN project
&lt;http://www.freeswan.org&gt; by Henry Spencer.</p>

<p>BUGS As with rsasigkey, the run time is difficult to
predict, since depletion of the system&acirc;s randomness
pool can cause arbitrarily long waits for random bits, and
the prime-number searches can also take unpre dictable (and
potentially large) amounts of CPU time. See
ipsec_rsasigkey(8) for some typical performance numbers.</p>

<p>A higher-level tool which could handle the clerical
details of changing to a new key would be helpful.</p>

<p>The requirement for --output is a blemish, but private
keys are extremely sensitive information and unusual
precautions seem justified.</p>
