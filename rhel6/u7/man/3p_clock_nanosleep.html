<p>CLOCK_NANOSLEEP(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
CLOCK_NANOSLEEP(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME clock_nanosleep - high resolution sleep with
specifiable clock (ADVANCED REALTIME)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;time.h&gt;</p>

<p>int clock_nanosleep(clockid_t clock_id, int flags, const
struct timespec *rqtp, struct timespec *rmtp);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION If the flag TIMER_ABSTIME is not set in the
flags argument, the clock_nanosleep() function shall cause
the current thread to be sus- pended from execution until
either the time interval specified by the rqtp argument has
elapsed, or a signal is delivered to the calling thread and
its action is to invoke a signal-catching function, or the
process is terminated. The clock used to measure the time
shall be the clock specified by clock_id.</p>

<p>If the flag TIMER_ABSTIME is set in the flags argument,
the clock_nanosleep() function shall cause the current
thread to be sus- pended from execution until either the
time value of the clock speci- fied by clock_id reaches the
absolute time specified by the rqtp argu- ment, or a signal
is delivered to the calling thread and its action is to
invoke a signal-catching function, or the process is
terminated. If, at the time of the call, the time value
specified by rqtp is less than or equal to the time value of
the specified clock, then clock_nanosleep() shall return
immediately and the calling process shall not be
suspended.</p>

<p>The suspension time caused by this function may be
longer than requested because the argument value is rounded
up to an integer multi- ple of the sleep resolution, or
because of the scheduling of other activity by the system.
But, except for the case of being interrupted by a signal,
the suspension time for the relative clock_nanosleep()
function (that is, with the TIMER_ABSTIME flag not set)
shall not be less than the time interval specified by rqtp,
as measured by the cor- responding clock. The suspension for
the absolute clock_nanosleep() function (that is, with the
TIMER_ABSTIME flag set) shall be in effect at least until
the value of the corresponding clock reaches the abso- lute
time specified by rqtp, except for the case of being
interrupted by a signal.</p>

<p>The use of the clock_nanosleep() function shall have no
effect on the action or blockage of any signal.</p>

<p>The clock_nanosleep() function shall fail if the
clock_id argument refers to the CPU-time clock of the
calling thread. It is unspecified whether clock_id values of
other CPU-time clocks are allowed.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE If the clock_nanosleep() function returns
because the requested time has elapsed, its return value
shall be zero.</p>

<p>If the clock_nanosleep() function returns because it has
been interrupted by a signal, it shall return the
corresponding error value. For the relative
clock_nanosleep() function, if the rmtp argument is
non-NULL, the timespec structure referenced by it shall be
updated to contain the amount of time remaining in the
interval (the requested time minus the time actually slept).
If the rmtp argument is NULL, the remaining time is not
returned. The absolute clock_nanosleep() function has no
effect on the structure referenced by rmtp.</p>

<p>If clock_nanosleep() fails, it shall return the
corresponding error value.</p>

<p>ERRORS The clock_nanosleep() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EINTR The clock_nanosleep() function was interrupted by
a signal.</p>

<p>EINVAL The rqtp argument specified a nanosecond value
less than zero or greater than or equal to 1000 million; or
the TIMER_ABSTIME flag was specified in flags and the rqtp
argument is outside the range for the clock specified by
clock_id; or the clock_id argu- ment does not specify a
known clock, or specifies the CPU-time clock of the calling
thread.</p>

<p>ENOTSUP The clock_id argument specifies a clock for
which clock_nanosleep() is not supported, such as a CPU-time
clock.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE Calling clock_nanosleep() with the
value TIMER_ABSTIME not set in the flags argument and with a
clock_id of CLOCK_REALTIME is equivalent to calling
nanosleep() with the same rqtp and rmtp arguments.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The nanosleep() function specifies that the
system-wide clock CLOCK_REALTIME is used to measure the
elapsed time for this time ser- vice. However, with the
introduction of the monotonic clock CLOCK_MONO- TONIC a new
relative sleep function is needed to allow an application to
take advantage of the special characteristics of this
clock.</p>

<p>There are many applications in which a process needs to
be suspended and then activated multiple times in a periodic
way; for example, to poll the status of a non-interrupting
device or to refresh a display device. For these cases, it
is known that precise periodic activation cannot be achieved
with a relative sleep() or nanosleep() function call.
Suppose, for example, a periodic process that is activated
at time T0, executes for a while, and then wants to suspend
itself until time T0+ T, the period being T. If this process
wants to use the nanosleep() function, it must first call
clock_gettime() to get the current time, then calculate the
difference between the current time and T0+ T and, finally,
call nanosleep() using the computed interval. However, the
process could be preempted by a different process between
the two function calls, and in this case the interval
computed would be wrong; the process would wake up later
than desired. This problem would not occur with the absolute
clock_nanosleep() function, since only one function call
would be necessary to suspend the process until the desired
time. In other cases, however, a relative sleep is needed,
and that is why both functionalities are required.</p>

<p>Although it is possible to implement periodic processes
using the timers interface, this implementation would
require the use of signals, and the reservation of some
signal numbers. In this regard, the reasons for including an
absolute version of the clock_nanosleep() function in IEEE
Std 1003.1-2001 are the same as for the inclusion of the
relative nanosleep().</p>

<p>It is also possible to implement precise periodic
processes using pthread_cond_timedwait(), in which an
absolute timeout is specified that takes effect if the
condition variable involved is never signaled. However, the
use of this interface is unnatural, and involves perform-
ing other operations on mutexes and condition variables that
imply an unnecessary overhead. Furthermore,
pthread_cond_timedwait() is not available in implementations
that do not support threads.</p>

<p>Although the interface of the relative and absolute
versions of the new high resolution sleep service is the
same clock_nanosleep() function, the rmtp argument is only
used in the relative sleep. This argument is needed in the
relative clock_nanosleep() function to reissue the func-
tion call if it is interrupted by a signal, but it is not
needed in the absolute clock_nanosleep() function call; if
the call is interrupted by a signal, the absolute
clock_nanosleep() function can be invoked again with the
same rqtp argument used in the interrupted call.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
