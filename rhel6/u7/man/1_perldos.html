<p>PERLDOS(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERLDOS(1)</p>

<p>NAME perldos - Perl under DOS, W31, W95.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS These are instructions for building Perl under
DOS (or w??), using DJGPP v2.03 or later. Under w95 long
filenames are supported.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Before you start, you should glance through
the README file found in the top-level directory where the
Perl distribution was extracted. Make sure you read and
understand the terms under which this software is being
distributed.</p>

<p>This port currently supports MakeMaker (the set of
modules that is used to build extensions to perl).
Therefore, you should be able to build and install most
extensions found in the CPAN sites.</p>

<p>Detailed instructions on how to build and install perl
extension modules, including XS-type modules, is included.
See BUILDING AND INSTALLING MODULES.</p>

<p>Prerequisites for Compiling Perl on DOS DJGPP DJGPP is a
port of GNU C/C++ compiler and development tools to 32-bit,
protected-mode environment on Intel 32-bit CPUs running MS-
DOS and compatible operating systems, by DJ Delorie
&lt;dj@delorie.com&gt; and friends.</p>

<p>For more details (FAQ), check out the home of DJGPP
at:</p>

<p>http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/</p>

<p>If you have questions about DJGPP, try posting to the
DJGPP newsgroup: comp.os.msdos.djgpp, or use the email
gateway djgpp@delorie.com.</p>

<p>You can find the full DJGPP distribution on any of the
mirrors listed here:</p>

<p>http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/getting.html</p>

<p>You need the following files to build perl (or add new
modules):</p>

<p>v2/djdev203.zip v2gnu/bnu2112b.zip v2gnu/gcc2953b.zip
v2gnu/bsh204b.zip v2gnu/mak3791b.zip v2gnu/fil40b.zip
v2gnu/sed3028b.zip v2gnu/txt20b.zip v2gnu/dif272b.zip
v2gnu/grep24b.zip v2gnu/shl20jb.zip v2gnu/gwk306b.zip
v2misc/csdpmi5b.zip</p>

<p>or possibly any newer version.</p>

<p>Pthreads Thread support is not tested in this version of
the djgpp perl.</p>

<p>Shortcomings of Perl under DOS Perl under DOS lacks some
features of perl under UNIX because of deficiencies in the
UNIX-emulation, most notably:</p>

<p>&middot; fork() and pipe()</p>

<p>&middot; some features of the UNIX filesystem regarding
link count and file dates</p>

<p>&middot; in-place operation is a little bit broken with
short filenames</p>

<p>&middot; sockets</p>

<p>Building Perl on DOS &middot; Unpack the source package
perl5.8*.tar.gz with djtarx. If you want to use long file
names under w95 and also to get Perl to pass all its tests,
dont forget to use</p>

<p>set LFN=y set FNCASE=y</p>

<p>before unpacking the archive.</p>

<p>&middot; Create a &quot;symlink&quot; or copy your
bash.exe to sh.exe in your &quot;($DJDIR)/bin&quot;
directory.</p>

<p>ln -s bash.exe sh.exe</p>

<p>[If you have the recommended version of bash for DJGPP,
this is already done for you.]</p>

<p>And make the &quot;SHELL&quot; environment variable
point to this sh.exe:</p>

<p>set SHELL=c:/djgpp/bin/sh.exe (use full path name!)</p>

<p>You can do this in djgpp.env too. Add this line BEFORE
any section definition:</p>

<p>+SHELL=%DJDIR%/bin/sh.exe</p>

<p>&middot; If you have split.exe and gsplit.exe in your
path, then rename split.exe to djsplit.exe, and gsplit.exe
to split.exe. Copy or link gecho.exe to echo.exe if you dont
have echo.exe. Copy or link gawk.exe to awk.exe if you dont
have awk.exe.</p>

<p>[If you have the recommended versions of djdev, shell
utilities and gawk, all these are already done for you, and
you will not need to do anything.]</p>

<p>&middot; Chdir to the djgpp subdirectory of perl
toplevel and type the following commands:</p>

<p>set FNCASE=y configure.bat</p>

<p>This will do some preprocessing then run the Configure
script for you. The Configure script is interactive, but in
most cases you just need to press ENTER. The &quot;set&quot;
command ensures that DJGPP preserves the letter case of file
names when reading directories. If you already issued this
set command when unpacking the archive, and you are in the
same DOS session as when you unpacked the archive, you dont
have to issue the set command again. This command is
necessary *before* you start to (re)configure or (re)build
perl in order to ensure both that perl builds correctly and
that building XS-type modules can succeed. See the DJGPP
info entry for &quot;_preserve_fncase&quot; for more
information:</p>

<p>info libc alphabetical _preserve_fncase</p>

<p>If the script says that your package is incomplete, and
asks whether to continue, just answer with Y (this can only
happen if you don t use long filenames or forget to issue
&quot;set FNCASE=y&quot; first).</p>

<p>When Configure asks about the extensions, I suggest IO
and Fcntl, and if you want database handling then SDBM_File
or GDBM_File (you need to install gdbm for this one). If you
want to use the POSIX extension (this is the default), make
sure that the stack size of your cc1.exe is at least
512kbyte (you can check this with: &quot;stubedit
cc1.exe&quot;).</p>

<p>You can use the Configure script in non-interactive mode
too. When I built my perl.exe, I used something like
this:</p>

<p>configure.bat -des</p>

<p>You can find more info about Configures command line
switches in the INSTALL file.</p>

<p>When the script ends, and you want to change some values
in the generated config.sh file, then run</p>

<p>sh Configure -S</p>

<p>after you made your modifications.</p>

<p>IMPORTANT: if you use this &quot;-S&quot; switch, be
sure to delete the CONFIG environment variable before
running the script:</p>

<p>set CONFIG=</p>

<p>&middot; Now you can compile Perl. Type:</p>

<p>make</p>

<p>Testing Perl on DOS Type:</p>

<p>make test</p>

<p>If youre lucky you should see &quot;All tests
successful&quot;. But there can be a few failed subtests
(less than 5 hopefully) depending on some external
conditions (e.g. some subtests fail under linux/dosemu or
plain dos with short filenames only).</p>

<p>Installation of Perl on DOS Type:</p>

<p>make install</p>

<p>This will copy the newly compiled perl and libraries
into your DJGPP directory structure. Perl.exe and the
utilities go into &quot;($DJDIR)/bin&quot;, and the library
goes under &quot;($DJDIR)/lib/perl5&quot;. The pod
documentation goes under
&quot;($DJDIR)/lib/perl5/pod&quot;.</p>

<p>BUILDING AND INSTALLING MODULES ON DOS Building
Prerequisites for Perl on DOS For building and installing
non-XS modules, all you need is a working perl under DJGPP.
Non-XS modules do not require re-linking the perl binary,
and so are simpler to build and install.</p>

<p>XS-type modules do require re-linking the perl binary,
because part of an XS module is written in &quot;C&quot;,
and has to be linked together with the perl binary to be
executed. This is required because perl under DJGPP is built
with the &quot;static link&quot; option, due to the lack of
&quot;dynamic linking&quot; in the DJGPP environment.</p>

<p>Because XS modules require re-linking of the perl
binary, you need both the perl binary distribution and the
perl source distribution to build an XS extension module. In
addition, you will have to have built your perl binary from
the source distribution so that all of the components of the
perl binary are available for the required link step.</p>

<p>Unpacking CPAN Modules on DOS First, download the module
package from CPAN (e.g., the &quot;Comma Separated
Value&quot; text package, Text-CSV-0.01.tar.gz). Then expand
the contents of the package into some location on your disk.
Most CPAN modules are built with an internal directory
structure, so it is usually safe to expand it in the root of
your DJGPP installation. Some people prefer to locate source
trees under /usr/src (i.e., &quot;($DJDIR)/usr/src&quot;),
but you may put it wherever seems most logical to you,
*EXCEPT* under the same directory as your perl source code.
There are special rules that apply to modules which live in
the perl source tree that do not apply to most of the
modules in CPAN.</p>

<p>Unlike other DJGPP packages, which are normal
&quot;zip&quot; files, most CPAN module packages are
&quot;gzipped tarballs&quot;. Recent versions of WinZip will
safely unpack and expand them, *UNLESS* they have
zero-length files. It is a known WinZip bug (as of v7.0)
that it will not extract zero- length files.</p>

<p>From the command line, you can use the djtar utility
provided with DJGPP to unpack and expand these files. For
example:</p>

<p>C:jgpp&gt;djtarx -v Text-CSV-0.01.tar.gz</p>

<p>This will create the new directory
&quot;($DJDIR)/Text-CSV-0.01&quot;, filling it with the
source for this module.</p>

<p>Building Non-XS Modules on DOS To build a non-XS module,
you can use the standard module-building instructions
distributed with perl modules.</p>

<p>perl Makefile.PL make make test make install</p>

<p>This is sufficient because non-XS modules install only
&quot;.pm&quot; files and (sometimes) pod and/or man
documentation. No re-linking of the perl binary is needed to
build, install or use non-XS modules.</p>

<p>Building XS Modules on DOS To build an XS module, you
must use the standard module-building instructions
distributed with perl modules *PLUS* three extra
instructions specific to the DJGPP &quot;static link&quot;
build environment.</p>

<p>set FNCASE=y perl Makefile.PL make make perl make test
make -f Makefile.aperl inst_perl MAP_TARGET=perl.exe make
install</p>

<p>The first extra instruction sets DJGPPs FNCASE
environment variable so that the new perl binary which you
must build for an XS-type module will build correctly. The
second extra instruction re-builds the perl binary in your
module directory before you run &quot;make test&quot;, so
that you are testing with the new module code you built with
&quot;make&quot;. The third extra instruction installs the
perl binary from your module directory into the standard
DJGPP binary directory, &quot;($DJDIR)/bin&quot;, replacing
your previous perl binary.</p>

<p>Note that the MAP_TARGET value *must* have the
&quot;.exe&quot; extension or you will not create a
&quot;perl.exe&quot; to replace the one in
&quot;($DJDIR)/bin&quot;.</p>

<p>When you are done, the XS-module install process will
have added information to your &quot;perllocal&quot;
information telling that the perl binary has been replaced,
and what module was installed. You can view this information
at any time by using the command:</p>

<p>perl -S perldoc perllocal</p>
