<p>SMP_CONF_ROUTE_INFO(8) SMP_UTILS

<p>NAME smp_conf_route_info - invoke CONFIGURE ROUTE
INFORMATION SMP function</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS smp_conf_route_info [--disable] [--expected=EX]
[--help] [--hex] [--index=IN] [--interface=PARAMS]
[--phy=ID] [--raw] [--routed=R_SAS_ADDR] [--sa=SAS_ADDR]
[--verbose] [--version] SMP_DEVICE[,N]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Sends a SAS Management Protocol (SMP)
CONFIGURE ROUTE INFORMATION request function to a SMP
target. The SMP target is identified by the SMP_DEVICE and
the --sa=SAS_ADDR. Depending on the interface, the SAS_ADDR
may be deduced from the SMP_DEVICE. With one interface there
is one SMP_DEVICE per machine so the SMP_DEVICE,N syntax is
needed to differentiate between HBAs if there are multiple
present.</p>

<p>Each phy in a SAS expander that has an associated
routing attribute of &quot;table&quot; has a router table.
The number of rows (or entries) in each router table is
given by the &quot;expander route indexes&quot; field in the
response of the REPORT GENERAL function.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Mandatory arguments to long options are
mandatory for short options as well.</p>

<p>-d, --disable set the &quot;disable expander route
entry&quot; flag in a row of the router table associated
with --phy=ID of the given SMP target (e.g. an expander).
Within the router table the row that is disabled is
identified by the expander route index given by
--index=IN.</p>

<p>-E, --expected=EX set the expected expander change count
field in the SMP request. The value EX is from 0 to 65535
inclusive with 0 being the default value. When EX is greater
than zero then if the value doesnt match the expander change
count of the SMP target (i.e. the expander) when the request
arrives then the target ignores the request and sets a
function result of &quot;invalid expander change count&quot;
in the response.</p>

<p>-h, --help output the usage message then exit.</p>

<p>-H, --hex output the response in hexadecimal.</p>

<p>-i, --index=IN expander route index. IN is a value
between 0 and 65535. Default is 0. More precisely the
maximum index value is (expander_route_indexes - 1).</p>

<p>-I, --interface=PARAMS interface specific parameters. In
this case &quot;interface&quot; refers to the path through
the operating system to the SMP initiator. See the smp_utils
man page for more information.</p>

<p>-p, --phy=ID phy identifier. ID is a value between 0 and
127. Default is 0.</p>

<p>-r, --raw send the response to stdout in binary. All
error messages are sent to stderr.</p>

<p>-R, --routed=R_SAS_ADDR specifies the SAS address to be
placed in a row (given by --index=IN) of the router table
associated with --phy=ID. Default value is 0. The R_SAS_ADDR
is in decimal but most SAS addresses are given in
hexadecimal. To give a number in hexadec- imal either prefix
it with 0x or put a trailing h on it.</p>

<p>-s, --sa=SAS_ADDR specifies the SAS address of the SMP
target device. Typically this is an expander. This option
may not be needed if the SMP_DEVICE has the targets SAS
address within it. The SAS_ADDR is in decimal but most SAS
addresses are shown in hexadecimal. To give a number in
hexadecimal either prefix it with 0x or put a trailing h on
it.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose increase the verbosity of the output. Can
be used multiple times</p>

<p>-V, --version print the version string and then
exit.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO The SMP CONFIGURE ROUTE INFORMATION
function was introduced in SAS-1 . The &quot;Expander change
count&quot; field was added in SAS-2 .</p>
