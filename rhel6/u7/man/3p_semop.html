<p>SEMOP(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual SEMOP(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME semop - XSI semaphore operations</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/sem.h&gt;</p>

<p>int semop(int semid, struct sembuf *sops, size_t
nsops);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The semop() function operates on XSI
semaphores (see the Base Defini- tions volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001, Section 4.15, Semaphore). It is unspecified
whether this function interoperates with the realtime
interprocess communication facilities defined in Realtime
.</p>

<p>The semop() function shall perform atomically a
user-defined array of semaphore operations on the set of
semaphores associated with the semaphore identifier
specified by the argument semid.</p>

<p>The argument sops is a pointer to a user-defined array
of semaphore operation structures. The implementation shall
not modify elements of this array unless the application
uses implementation-defined exten- sions.</p>

<p>The argument nsops is the number of such structures in
the array.</p>

<p>Each structure, sembuf, includes the following
members:</p>

<p>Member Type Member Name Description short sem_num
Semaphore number. short sem_op Semaphore operation. short
sem_flg Operation flags.</p>

<p>Each semaphore operation specified by sem_op is
performed on the corre- sponding semaphore specified by
semid and sem_num.</p>

<p>The variable sem_op specifies one of three semaphore
operations:</p>

<p>1. If sem_op is a negative integer and the calling
process has alter permission, one of the following shall
occur:</p>

<p>* If semval(see &lt;sys/sem.h&gt;) is greater than or
equal to the abso- lute value of sem_op, the absolute value
of sem_op is subtracted from semval. Also, if (sem_flg
&amp;SEM_UNDO) is non-zero, the abso- lute value of sem_op
shall be added to the calling process semadj value for the
specified semaphore.</p>

<p>* If semval is less than the absolute value of sem_op
and (sem_flg &amp;IPC_NOWAIT) is non-zero, semop() shall
return immediately.</p>

<p>* If semval is less than the absolute value of sem_op
and (sem_flg &amp;IPC_NOWAIT) is 0, semop() shall increment
the semncnt associ- ated with the specified semaphore and
suspend execution of the calling thread until one of the
following conditions occurs:</p>

<p>* The value of semval becomes greater than or equal to
the absolute value of sem_op. When this occurs, the value of
sem- ncnt associated with the specified semaphore shall be
decre- mented, the absolute value of sem_op shall be
subtracted from semval and, if (sem_flg &amp;SEM_UNDO) is
non-zero, the absolute value of sem_op shall be added to the
calling process semadj value for the specified
semaphore.</p>

<p>* The semid for which the calling thread is awaiting
action is removed from the system. When this occurs, errno
shall be set equal to [EIDRM] and -1 shall be returned.</p>

<p>* The calling thread receives a signal that is to be
caught. When this occurs, the value of semncnt associated
with the specified semaphore shall be decremented, and the
calling thread shall resume execution in the manner
prescribed in sigaction().</p>

<p>2. If sem_op is a positive integer and the calling
process has alter permission, the value of sem_op shall be
added to semval and, if (sem_flg &amp;SEM_UNDO) is non-zero,
the value of sem_op shall be sub- tracted from the calling
process semadj value for the specified semaphore.</p>

<p>3. If sem_op is 0 and the calling process has read
permission, one of the following shall occur:</p>

<p>* If semval is 0, semop() shall return immediately.</p>

<p>* If semval is non-zero and (sem_flg &amp;IPC_NOWAIT) is
non-zero, semop() shall return immediately.</p>

<p>* If semval is non-zero and (sem_flg &amp;IPC_NOWAIT) is
0, semop() shall increment the semzcnt associated with the
specified semaphore and suspend execution of the calling
thread until one of the following occurs:</p>

<p>* The value of semval becomes 0, at which time the value
of semzcnt associated with the specified semaphore shall be
decremented.</p>

<p>* The semid for which the calling thread is awaiting
action is removed from the system. When this occurs, errno
shall be set equal to [EIDRM] and -1 shall be returned.</p>

<p>* The calling thread receives a signal that is to be
caught. When this occurs, the value of semzcnt associated
with the specified semaphore shall be decremented, and the
calling thread shall resume execution in the manner
prescribed in sigaction().</p>

<p>Upon successful completion, the value of sempid for each
semaphore specified in the array pointed to by sops shall be
set equal to the process ID of the calling process.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, semop() shall
return 0; otherwise, it shall return -1 and set errno to
indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The semop() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>E2BIG The value of nsops is greater than the
system-imposed maximum.</p>

<p>EACCES Operation permission is denied to the calling
process; see XSI Interprocess Communication .</p>

<p>EAGAIN The operation would result in suspension of the
calling process but (sem_flg &amp;IPC_NOWAIT) is
non-zero.</p>

<p>EFBIG The value of sem_num is less than 0 or greater
than or equal to the number of semaphores in the set
associated with semid.</p>

<p>EIDRM The semaphore identifier semid is removed from the
system.</p>

<p>EINTR The semop() function was interrupted by a
signal.</p>

<p>EINVAL The value of semid is not a valid semaphore
identifier, or the number of individual semaphores for which
the calling process requests a SEM_UNDO would exceed the
system-imposed limit.</p>

<p>ENOSPC The limit on the number of individual processes
requesting a SEM_UNDO would be exceeded.</p>

<p>ERANGE An operation would cause a semval to overflow the
system-imposed limit, or an operation would cause a semadj
value to overflow the system-imposed limit.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Setting Values in Semaphores The following
example sets the values of the two semaphores associated
with the semid identifier to the values contained in the sb
array.</p>

<p>#include &lt;sys/sem.h&gt; ... int semid; struct sembuf
sb[2]; int nsops = 2; int result;</p>

<p>/* Adjust value of semaphore in the semaphore array
semid. */ sb[0].sem_num = 0; sb[0].sem_op = -1;
sb[0].sem_flg = SEM_UNDO | IPC_NOWAIT; sb[1].sem_num = 1;
sb[1].sem_op = 1; sb[1].sem_flg = 0;</p>

<p>result = semop(semid, sb, nsops);</p>

<p>Creating a Semaphore Identifier The following example
gets a unique semaphore key using the ftok() function, then
gets a semaphore ID associated with that key using the
semget() function (the first call also tests to make sure
the semaphore exists). If the semaphore does not exist, the
program creates it, as shown by the second call to semget().
In creating the semaphore for the queuing process, the
program attempts to create one semaphore with read/write
permission for all. It also uses the IPC_EXCL flag, which
forces semget() to fail if the semaphore already exists.</p>

<p>After creating the semaphore, the program uses a call to
semop() to initialize it to the values in the sbuf array.
The number of processes that can execute concurrently
without queuing is initially set to 2. The final call to
semget() creates a semaphore identifier that can be used
later in the program.</p>

<p>The final call to semop() acquires the semaphore and
waits until it is free; the SEM_UNDO option releases the
semaphore when the process exits, waiting until there are
less than two processes running concur- rently.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The POSIX Realtime Extension defines
alternative interfaces for inter- process communication.
Application developers who need to use IPC should design
their applications so that modules using the IPC routines
described in XSI Interprocess Communication can be easily
modified to use the alternative interfaces.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>
