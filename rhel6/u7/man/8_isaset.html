<p>NAME isaset - set ISA registers</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS isaset [-y] addrreg datareg address value
[mask] #for I2C-like access isaset [-y] -f address value
[mask] #for flat address space</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION isaset is a small helper program to set
registers visible through the ISA bus.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -f Enable flat address space mode.</p>

<p>-y Disable interactive mode. By default, isaset will
wait for a confirmation from the user before messing with
the ISA bus. When this flag is used, it will perform the
operation directly. This is mainly meant to be used in
scripts.</p>

<p>OPTIONS (I2C-like access mode) Four options must be
provided to isaset. addrreg contains the ISA address of the
address register for the chip to probe; datareg contains the
address of the data register. Both addresses are integers
between 0x0000 and 0x3FFF. Usually, if the chips base
address is 0x0nn0, the address register is at 0x0nn5 and the
data register is at 0x0nn6. The most common base address for
hardware monitoring chips is 0x0290. For Super-I/O chips,
address register is typically at 0x2E with data regis- ter
at 0x2F. The address and value parameters are two integers
between 0x00 and 0xFF. isaset will write value value to
address address. An optional mask can be provided as a fifth
parameter, preserving unmasked bits at the written
location.</p>

<p>OPTIONS (flat address space mode) In flat mode, two
parameters must be provided. address contains the ISA
address of the register to write to; it is an integer
between 0x0000 and 0xFFFF. Basically, it is the sum of the
chip s base address and the chip register s address. isaset
will write value value at this address. An optional mask can
be provided as a third parameter, preserving unmasked bits
at the written location.</p>

<p>WARNING Poking around in ISA data space is extremely
dangerous. Running isaset with random parameters can cause
system crashes, data loss, and worse! Be extremely careful
when using this program.</p>
