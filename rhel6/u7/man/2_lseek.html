<p>NAME lseek - reposition read/write file offset</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; #include
&lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>off_t lseek(int fd, off_t offset, int whence);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The lseek() function repositions the offset
of the open file associated with the file descriptor fd to
the argument offset according to the directive whence as
follows:</p>

<p>SEEK_SET The offset is set to offset bytes.</p>

<p>SEEK_CUR The offset is set to its current location plus
offset bytes.</p>

<p>SEEK_END The offset is set to the size of the file plus
offset bytes.</p>

<p>The lseek() function allows the file offset to be set
beyond the end of the file (but this does not change the
size of the file). If data is later written at this point,
subsequent reads of the data in the gap (a &quot;hole&quot;)
return null bytes (&rsquo; &rsquo;) until data is actually
written into the gap.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, lseek() returns
the resulting offset loca- tion as measured in bytes from
the beginning of the file. Otherwise, a value of (off_t) -1
is returned and errno is set to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS EBADF fd is not an open file descriptor.</p>

<p>EINVAL whence is not one of SEEK_SET, SEEK_CUR,
SEEK_END; or the resulting file offset would be negative, or
beyond the end of a seekable device.</p>

<p>EOVERFLOW The resulting file offset cannot be
represented in an off_t.</p>

<p>ESPIPE fd is associated with a pipe, socket, or
FIFO.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO SVr4, 4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>NOTES This documents use of whence is incorrect English,
but maintained for historical reasons.</p>

<p>Some devices are incapable of seeking and POSIX does not
specify which devices must support lseek().</p>

<p>On Linux, using lseek() on a tty device returns
ESPIPE.</p>

<p>When converting old code, substitute values for whence
with the follow- ing macros:</p>

<p>old new 0 SEEK_SET 1 SEEK_CUR 2 SEEK_END L_SET SEEK_SET
L_INCR SEEK_CUR L_XTND SEEK_END</p>

<p>SVr1-3 returns long instead of off_t, BSD returns
int.</p>

<p>Note that file descriptors created by dup(2) or fork(2)
share the cur- rent file position pointer, so seeking on
such files may be subject to race conditions.</p>
