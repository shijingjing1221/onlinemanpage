<p>sane-ma1509(5) SANE Scanner Access Now Easy
sane-ma1509(5)</p>

<p>NAME sane-ma1509 - SANE backend for Mustek BearPaw 1200F
USB scanner</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sane-ma1509 library implements a SANE
(Scanner Access Now Easy) backend that provides access to
the Mustek BearPaw 1200F USB flatbed scanner. This scanner
is based on the MA-1509 chipset. Other scanners that use
this chip (if they exist) may also work.</p>

<p>This backend is ALPHA software. Be careful and remove
the power plug immediately if your hear unusual noises.</p>

<p>More details can be found on the ma1509 backend homepage
http://www.meier-geinitz.de/sane/ma1509-backend/.</p>

<p>Other Mustek USB scanners are supported by the gt68xx,
mustek_usb and the plustek backends. See sane-mustek_usb(5),
sane-gt68xx(5) and sane-plustek(5) for details.</p>

<p>This backend can only work with scanners that are
already detected by the operating system. See sane-usb(5)
for details.</p>

<p>If you own a scanner other than the Mustek BearPaw 1200F
that works with this backend, please let me know this by
sending the scanners exact model name and the USB vendor and
device ids (e.g. from /proc/bus/usb/devices or syslog) to
me.</p>

<p>DEVICE NAMES This backend expects device names of the
form:</p>

<p>special</p>

<p>Where special is a path-name for the special device that
corresponds to a USB scanner. With Linux, such a device name
could be /dev/usb/scan- ner0 or libusb:001:002, for
example.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION The contents of the ma1509.conf file is a
list of options and device names that correspond to Mustek
BearPaw 1200F scanners. Empty lines and lines starting with
a hash mark (#) are ignored.</p>

<p>Instead of using the device name, the scanner can be
autodetected by usb vendor_id product_id statements which
are already included into ma1509.conf. This is only
supported with Linux 2.4.8 and higher and all systems that
support libsub. &quot;vendor_id&quot; and
&quot;product_id&quot; are hex- adecimal numbers that
identify the scanner. If this doesnt work, a device name
must be placed in ma1509.conf as described above.</p>

<p>To set the time the lamp needs for warm-up, use option
warmup-time in ma1509.conf. The time is given in seconds
after the option. The default is 30 seconds.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/sane.d/ma1509.conf The backend configuration
file (see also description of SANE_CONFIG_DIR below).</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-ma1509.a The static library
implementing this backend.</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-ma1509.so The shared library
implementing this backend (present on systems that support
dynamic loading).</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT SANE_CONFIG_DIR This environment variable
specifies the list of directories that may contain the
configuration file. Under UNIX, the directories are
separated by a colon (:), under OS/2, they are separated by
a semi-colon (;). If this variable is not set, the config-
uration file is searched in two default directories: first,
the current working directory (&quot;.&quot;) and then in
/etc/sane.d. If the value of the environment variable ends
with the directory sepa- rator character, then the default
directories are searched after the explicitly specified
directories. For example, setting SANE_CONFIG_DIR to
&quot;/tmp/config:&quot; would result in directories
&quot;tmp/config&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and
&quot;/etc/sane.d&quot; being searched (in this order).</p>

<p>SANE_DEBUG_MA1509 If the library was compiled with debug
support enabled, this environment variable controls the
debug level for this backend. Higher debug levels increase
the verbosity of the output.</p>
