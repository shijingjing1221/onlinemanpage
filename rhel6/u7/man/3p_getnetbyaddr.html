<p>ENDNETENT(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
ENDNETENT(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME endnetent, getnetbyaddr, getnetbyname, getnetent,
setnetent - network database functions</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;netdb.h&gt;</p>

<p>void endnetent(void); struct netent
*getnetbyaddr(uint32_t net, int type); struct netent
*getnetbyname(const char *name); struct netent
*getnetent(void); void setnetent(int stayopen);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION These functions shall retrieve information
about networks. This infor- mation is considered to be
stored in a database that can be accessed sequentially or
randomly. The implementation of this database is
unspecified.</p>

<p>The setnetent() function shall open and rewind the
database. If the stayopen argument is non-zero, the
connection to the net database shall not be closed after
each call to getnetent() (either directly, or indi- rectly
through one of the other getnet*() functions), and the
implemen- tation may maintain an open file descriptor to the
database.</p>

<p>The getnetent() function shall read the next entry of
the database, opening and closing a connection to the
database as necessary.</p>

<p>The getnetbyaddr() function shall search the database
from the begin- ning, and find the first entry for which the
address family specified by type matches the n_addrtype
member and the network number net matches the n_net member,
opening and closing a connection to the database as
necessary. The net argument shall be the network number in
host byte order.</p>

<p>The getnetbyname() function shall search the database
from the begin- ning and find the first entry for which the
network name specified by name matches the n_name member,
opening and closing a connection to the database as
necessary.</p>

<p>The getnetbyaddr(), getnetbyname(), and getnetent()
functions shall each return a pointer to a netent structure,
the members of which shall contain the fields of an entry in
the network database.</p>

<p>The endnetent() function shall close the database,
releasing any open file descriptor.</p>

<p>These functions need not be reentrant. A function that
is not required to be reentrant is not required to be
thread-safe.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, getnetbyaddr(),
getnetbyname(), and getne- tent() shall return a pointer to
a netent structure if the requested entry was found, and a
null pointer if the end of the database was reached or the
requested entry was not found. Otherwise, a null pointer
shall be returned.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The getnetbyaddr(), getnetbyname(),
and getnetent() functions may return pointers to static
data, which may be overwritten by subsequent calls to any of
these functions.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
