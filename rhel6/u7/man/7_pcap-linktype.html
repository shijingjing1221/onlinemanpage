<p>NAME pcap-linktype - link-layer header types supported
by libpcap</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION For a live capture or savefile, libpcap
supplies, as the return value of the pcap_datalink(3PCAP)
routine, a value that indicates the type of link-layer
header at the beginning of the packets it provides. This is
not necessarily the type of link-layer header that the
packets being captured have on the network from which theyre
being captured; for example, packets from an IEEE 802.11
network might be provided by libpcap with Ethernet headers
that the network adapter or the network adapter driver
generates from the 802.11 headers. The names for those
values begin with DLT_, so they are sometimes called
&quot;DLT_ values&quot;.</p>

<p>The values stored in the link-layer header type field in
the savefile header are, in most but not all cases, the same
as the values returned by pcap_datalink(). The names for
those values begin with LINKTYPE_.</p>

<p>The link-layer header types supported by libpcap are
described at http://www.tcpdump.org/linktypes.html.</p>
