<p>DESCRIPTION dot draws directed graphs. It works well on
DAGs and other graphs that can be drawn as hierarchies. It
reads attributed graph files and writes drawings. By
default, the output format dot is the input file with layout
coordinates appended.</p>

<p>neato draws undirected graphs using spring models (see
Kamada and Kawai, Information Processing Letters 31:1, April
1989). Input files must be formatted in the dot attributed
graph language. By default, the output of neato is the input
graph with layout coordinates appended.</p>

<p>twopi draws graphs using a radial layout (see G. Wills,
Symposium on Graph Drawing GD97, September, 1997).
Basically, one node is chosen as the center and put at the
origin. The remaining nodes are placed on a sequence of
concentric circles centered about the origin, each a fixed
radial distance from the previous circle. All nodes distance
1 from the center are placed on the first circle; all nodes
distance 1 from a node on the first circle are placed on the
second circle; and so forth.</p>

<p>circo draws graphs using a circular layout (see Six and
Tollis, GD 99 and ALENEX 99, and Kaufmann and Wiese, GD 02.)
The tool identifies biconnected components and draws the
nodes of the component on a cir- cle. The block-cutpoint
tree is then laid out using a recursive radial algorithm.
Edge crossings within a circle are minimized by placing as
many edges on the circle s perimeter as possible. In
particular, if the component is outerplanar, the component
will have a planar layout.</p>

<p>If a node belongs to multiple non-trivial biconnected
components, the layout puts the node in one of them. By
default, this is the first non-trivial component found in
the search from the root component.</p>

<p>fdp draws undirected graphs using a spring model. It
relies on a force-directed approach in the spirit of
Fruchterman and Reingold (cf. Software-Practice &amp;
Experience 21(11), 1991, pp. 1129-1164).</p>

<p>sfdp also draws undirected graphs using the spring model
described above, but it uses a multi-scale approach to
produce layouts of large graphs in a reasonably short
time.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FORMATS Dot uses an extensible plugin mechanism
for its output renderers, so to see what output formats your
installation of dot supports you can use dot -Txxx (where
xxx is an unlikely format) and check the warning message.
Also, The plugin mechanism supports multiple implementations
of the output formats. To see what variants are available,
use, for example: dot -Tpng: and to force a particular
variant, use, for example: dot -Tpng:gd</p>

<p>Traditionally, dot supports the following: -Tps
(PostScript), -Tsvg -Tsvgz (Structured Vector Graphics),
-Tfig (XFIG graphics), -Tmif (FrameMaker graphics), -Thpgl
(HP pen plotters), and -Tpcl (Laserjet printers), -Tpng
-Tgif (bitmap graphics), -Tdia (GTK+ based diagrams), -Timap
(imagemap files for httpd servers for each node or edge that
has a non-null &quot;href&quot; attribute.), -Tcmapx
(client-side imagemap for use in html and xhtml). Additional
less common or more special-purpose output formats can be
found at http://www.graphviz.org/cvs/doc/info/out-
put.html.)</p>

<p>Alternative plugins providing support for a given output
format can be found from the error message resulting from
appending a : to the for- mat. e.g. -Tpng: The first plugin
listed is always the default.</p>

<p>The -P switch can be used to produce a graph of all
output variants supported by plugins in the local
installation of graphviz.</p>

<p>GRAPH FILE LANGUAGE Here is a synopsis of the graph file
language, traditionally using the extension .dot, for
graphs:</p>

<p>[strict] (graph|digraph) name { statement-list } Is the
top level graph. If the graph is strict then multiple edges
are not allowed between the same pairs of nodes. If it is a
directed graph, indicated by digraph, then the edgeop must
be &quot;-&gt;&quot;. If it is an undirected graph then the
edgeop must be &quot;--&quot;. Statements may be:</p>

<p>name=val; node [name=val]; edge [name=val]; Set default
graph, node, or edge attribute name to val. Any subgraph,
node, or edge appearing after this inherits the new default
attributes.</p>

<p>n0 [name0=val0,name1=val1,...]; Creates node n0 (if it
does not already exist) and sets its attributes according to
the optional list.</p>

<p>n0 edgeop n1 edgeop ... edgeop nn
[name0=val0,name1=val1,...]; Creates edges between nodes n0,
n1, ..., nn and sets their attributes according to the
optional list. Creates nodes as necessary.</p>

<p>[subgraph name] { statement-list } Creates a subgraph.
Subgraphs may be used in place of n0, ..., nn in the above
statements to create edges. [subgraph name] is optional; if
missing, the subgraph is assigned an internal name.</p>

<p>Comments may be /*C-like*/ or //C++-like.</p>

<p>Attribute names and values are ordinary (C-style)
strings. The follow- ing sections describe attributes that
control graph layout.</p>

<p>GRAPH ATTRIBUTES size=&quot;x,y&quot; sets bounding box
of drawing in inches.</p>

<p>page=&quot;x,y&quot; sets the PostScript pagination
unit.</p>

<p>ratio=f sets the aspect ratio to f which may be a
floating point num- ber, or one of the keywords fill,
compress, or auto.</p>

<p>layout=engine indicates the preferred layout engine
(&quot;dot&quot;, &quot;neato&quot;, fdp&quot; etc)
overriding the default from the basename of the command or
the -K commandline option.</p>

<p>margin=f sets the page margin (included in the page
size).</p>

<p>nodesep=f sets the minimum separation between nodes.</p>

<p>ranksep=f sets the minimum separation between ranks.</p>

<p>ordering=out constrains order of out-edges in a subgraph
according to their file sequence.</p>

<p>rankdir=LR|RL|BT requests a left-to-right,
right-to-left, or bot- tom-to-top, drawing.</p>

<p>pagedir=[TBLR][TBLR] sets the major and minor order of
pagination.</p>

<p>rank=same (or min or max) in a subgraph constrains the
rank assignment of its nodes. If a subgraph s name has the
prefix cluster, its nodes are drawn in a distinct rectangle
of the layout. Clusters may be nested.</p>

<p>rotate=90 sets landscape mode. (orientation=land is
backward compati- ble but obsolete.)</p>

<p>center=n a non-zero value centers the drawing on the
page.</p>

<p>nslimit=f or mclimit=f adjusts the bound on the number
of network sim- plex or mincross iterations by the given
ratio. For example, mclimit=2.0 runs twice as long.</p>

<p>layers=&quot;id:id:id:id&quot; is a sequence of layer
identifiers for overlay diagrams. The PostScript array
variable layercolorseq sets the assign- ment of colors to
layers. The least index is 1 and each element must be a
3-element array to be interpreted as a color coordinate.</p>

<p>color=colorvalue sets foreground color (bgcolor for
background).</p>

<p>href=&quot;url&quot; the default url for image map
files; in PostScript files, the base URL for all relative
URLs, as recognized by Acrobat Distiller 3.0 and up.</p>

<p>URL=&quot;url&quot; (&quot;URL&quot; is a synonym for
&quot;href&quot;.)</p>

<p>stylesheet=&quot;file.css&quot; includes a reference to
a stylesheet in -Tsvg and -Tsvgz outputs. Ignored by other
formats.</p>

<p>splines. If set to true, edges are drawn as splines. If
set to poly- line, edges are drawn as polylines. If set to
ortho, edges are drawn as orthogonal polylines. In all of
these cases, the nodes may not overlap. If splines=false or
splines=line, edges are drawn as line segments. The default
is true for dot, and false for all other lay- outs.</p>

<p>(neato-specific attributes) start=val. Requests random
initial placement and seeds the random num- ber generator.
If val is not an integer, the process ID or current time is
used as the seed.</p>

<p>epsilon=n. Sets the cutoff for the solver. The default
is 0.1.</p>

<p>(twopi-specific attributes) root=ctr. This specifies the
node to be used as the center of the lay- out. If not
specified, twopi will randomly pick one of the nodes that
are furthest from a leaf node, where a leaf node is a node
of degree 1. If no leaf nodes exists, an arbitrary node is
picked as center.</p>

<p>ranksep=val. Specifies the radial distance in inches
between the sequence of rings. The default is 0.75.</p>

<p>overlap=mode. This specifies what twopi should do if any
nodes overlap. If mode is &quot;false&quot;, the program
uses Voronoi diagrams to adjust the nodes to eliminate
overlaps. If mode is &quot;scale&quot;, the layout is uni-
formly scaled up, preserving node sizes, until nodes no
longer overlap. The latter technique removes overlaps while
preserving symmetry and structure, while the former removes
overlaps more compactly but destroys symmetries. If mode is
&quot;true&quot; (the default), no repositioning is
done.</p>

<p>(circo-specific attributes) root=nodename. Specifies the
name of a node occurring in the root block. If the graph is
disconnected, the root node attribute can be used to specify
additional root blocks.</p>

<p>mindist=value. Sets the minimum separation between all
nodes. If not specified then circo uses a default value of
1.0.</p>

<p>(fdp-specific attributes) K=val. Sets the default ideal
node separation in the layout.</p>

<p>maxiter=val. Sets the maximum number of iterations used
to layout the graph.</p>

<p>start=val. Adjusts the random initial placement of nodes
with no speci- fied position. If val is is an integer, it is
used as the seed for the random number generator. If val is
not an integer, a random sys- tem-generated integer, such as
the process ID or current time, is used as the seed.</p>

<p>NODE ATTRIBUTES height=d or width=d sets minimum height
or width. Adding fixed- size=true forces these to be the
actual size (text labels are ignored).</p>

<p>shape=record polygon epsf builtin_polygon
builtin_polygon is one of: plaintext ellipse oval circle egg
triangle box diamond trapezium parallelogram house hexagon
octagon note tab box3d component. (Polygons are defined or
modified by the following node attributes: regular,
peripheries, sides, orientation, distortion and skew.) epsf
uses the nodes shapefile attribute as the path name of an
external EPSF file to be automatically loaded for the node
shape.</p>

<p>label=text where text may include escaped newlines 0 r
for center, left, and right justified lines. The string alue
will be replaced by the node name. The string G value will
be replaced by the graph name. Record labels may contain
recursive box lists delim- ited by { | }. Port identifiers
in labels are set off by angle brack- ets &lt; &gt;. In the
graph file, use colon (such as, node0:port28).</p>

<p>fontsize=n sets the label type size to n points.</p>

<p>fontname=name sets the label font family name.</p>

<p>color=colorvalue sets the outline color, and the default
fill color if style=filled and fillcolor is not
specified.</p>

<p>fillcolor=colorvalue sets the fill color when
style=filled. If not specified, the fillcolor when
style=filled defaults to be the same as the outline
color.</p>

<p>fontcolor=colorvalue sets the label text color.</p>

<p>A colorvalue may be &quot;h,s,v&quot; (hue, saturation,
brightness) floating point numbers between 0 and 1, or an
X11 color name such as white black red green blue yellow
magenta cyan or burlywood, or a &quot;#rrggbb&quot; (red,
green, blue, 2 hex characters each) value.</p>

<p>style=filled solid dashed dotted bold invis or any
Postscript code.</p>

<p>layer=id or id:id or &quot;all&quot; sets the nodes
active layers. The empty string means no layers
(invisible).</p>

<p>The following attributes apply only to polygon shape
nodes:</p>

<p>regular=n if n is non-zero then the polygon is made
regular, i.e. sym- metric about the x and y axis, otherwise
the polygon takes on the aspect ratio of the label.
builtin_polygons that are not already regu- lar are made
regular by this attribute. builtin_polygons that are already
regular are not affected (i.e. they cannot be made asymmet-
ric).</p>

<p>peripheries=n sets the number of periphery lines drawn
around the poly- gon. This value supersedes the number of
periphery lines of builtin_polygons.</p>

<p>sides=n sets the number of sides to the polygon. n&lt;3
results in an ellipse. This attribute is ignored by
builtin_polygons.</p>

<p>orientation=f sets the orientation of the first apex of
the polygon counterclockwise from the vertical, in degrees.
f may be a floating point number. The orientation of labels
is not affected by this attribute. This attribute is added
to the initial orientation of builtin_polygons.</p>

<p>distortion=f sets the amount of broadening of the top
and narrowing of the bottom of the polygon (relative to its
orientation). Floating point values between -1 and +1 are
suggested. This attribute is ignored by
builtin_polygons.</p>

<p>skew=f sets the amount of right-displacement of the top
and left-dis- placement of the bottom of the polygon
(relative to its orientation). Floating point values between
-1 and +1 are suggested. This attribute is ignored by
builtin_polygons.</p>

<p>href=&quot;url&quot; sets the url for the node in
imagemap, PostScript and SVG files. The substrings nd G are
substituted in the same manner as for the node label
attribute. Additionally the substring s substituted with the
node label string.</p>

<p>URL=&quot;url&quot; (&quot;URL&quot; is a synonym for
&quot;href&quot;.)</p>

<p>target=&quot;target&quot; is a target string for
client-side imagemaps and SVG, effective when nodes have a
URL. The target string is used to deter- mine which window
of the browser is used for the URL. Setting it to
&quot;_graphviz&quot; will open a new window if it doesn t
already exist, or reuse it if it does. If the target string
is empty, the default, then no target attribute is included
in the output. The substrings nd G are substituted in the
same manner as for the node label attribute. Additionally
the substring s substituted with the node label string.</p>

<p>tooltip=&quot;tooltip&quot; is a tooltip string for
client-side imagemaps and SVG, effective when nodes have a
URL. The tooltip string defaults to be the same as the label
string, but this attribute permits nodes with- out labels to
still have tooltips thus permitting denser graphs. The
substrings nd G are substituted in the same manner as for
the node label attribute. Additionally the substring s
substituted with the node label string.</p>

<p>(circo-specific attributes) root=true/false. This
specifies that the block containing the given node be
treated as the root of the spanning tree in the layout.</p>

<p>(fdp-specific attributes) pin=val. If val is
&quot;true&quot;, the node will remain at its initial posi-
tion.</p>

<p>EDGE ATTRIBUTES minlen=n where n is an integer factor
that applies to the edge length (ranks for normal edges, or
minimum node separation for flat edges).</p>

<p>weight=n where n is the integer cost of the edge. Values
greater than 1 tend to shorten the edge. Weight 0 flat edges
are ignored for order- ing nodes.</p>

<p>label=text where text may include escaped newlines 0 r
for centered, left, or right justified lines. If the
substring T is found in a label it will be replaced by the
tail_node name. If the substring s found in a label it will
be replaced by the head_node name. If the substring value is
found in a label it will be replaced by:
tail_node_name-&gt;head_node_name If the substring G is
found in a label it will be replaced by the graph name. or
by: tail_node_name--head_node_name for undirected
graphs.</p>

<p>fontsize=n sets the label type size to n points.</p>

<p>fontname=name sets the label font family name.</p>

<p>fontcolor=colorvalue sets the label text color.</p>

<p>style=solid dashed dotted bold invis</p>

creates paral- lel edges, one edge for each color.</p>

<p>dir=forward back both none controls arrow direction.</p>

<p>tailclip,headclip=false disables endpoint shape
clipping.</p>

<p>href=&quot;url&quot; sets the url for the node in
imagemap, PostScript and SVG files. The substrings T, and G
are substituted in the same manner as for the edge label
attribute. Additionally the sub- string s substituted with
the edge label string.</p>

<p>URL=&quot;url&quot; (&quot;URL&quot; is a synonym for
&quot;href&quot;.)</p>

<p>target=&quot;target&quot; is a target string for
client-side imagemaps and SVG, effective when edges have a
URL. If the target string is empty, the default, then no
target attribute is included in the output. The substrings
T, and G are substituted in the same manner as for the edge
label attribute. Additionally the substring s substituted
with the edge label string.</p>

<p>tooltip=&quot;tooltip&quot; is a tooltip string for
client-side imagemaps effec- tive when edges have a URL. The
tooltip string defaults to be the same as the edge label
string. The substrings T, and G are substituted in the same
manner as for the edge label attribute. Addi- tionally the
substring s substituted with the edge label string.</p>

<p>arrowhead,arrowtail=none, normal, inv, dot, odot,
invdot, invodot, tee, empty, invempty, open, halfopen,
diamond, odiamond, box, obox, crow.</p>

edge label string.</p>

<p>headURL=&quot;url&quot; (&quot;headURL&quot; is a
synonym for &quot;headhref&quot;.)</p>

<p>headtarget=&quot;headtarget&quot; is a target string for
client-side imagemaps and SVG, effective when edge heads
have a URL. The headtarget string is used to determine which
window of the browser is used for the URL. If the headtarget
string is empty, the default, then headtarget defaults to
the same value as target for the edge. The substrings T, and
G are substituted in the same manner as for the edge label
attribute. Additionally the substring s substituted with the
edge label string.</p>

<p>headtooltip=&quot;tooltip&quot; is a tooltip string for
client-side imagemaps effective when head ports have a URL.
The tooltip string defaults to be the same as the headlabel
string. The substrings T , and are substituted in the same
manner as for the edge label attribute. Additionally the
substring s substituted with the edge label string.</p>

<p>tailhref=&quot;url&quot; sets the url for the tail port
in imagemap, PostScript and SVG files. The substrings T, and

same port, using the average landing point.</p>

<p>constraint=false causes an edge to be ignored for rank
assignment.</p>

<p>layer=id or id:id or &quot;all&quot; sets the edges
active layers. The empty string means no layers
(invisible).</p>

<p>(neato-specific attributes) w=f sets the weight (spring
constant) of an edge to the given floating point value. The
default is 1.0; greater values make the edge tend more
toward its optimal length.</p>

<p>len=f sets the optimal length of an edge. The default is
1.0.</p>

<p>(fdp-specific attributes) weight=f sets the weight of an
edge to the given floating point value. The default is 1.0;
greater values make the edge tend more toward its optimal
length.</p>

<p>COMMAND LINE OPTIONS -G sets a default graph attribute.
-N sets a default node attribute. -E sets a default edge
attribute. Example: -Gsize=&quot;7,8&quot; -Nshape=box
-Efontsize=8</p>

<p>-lfile loads custom PostScript library files. Usually
these define custom shapes or styles. If -l is given by
itself, the standard library is omitted.</p>

<p>-Tlang sets the output language as described above.</p>

<p>-n[1|2] (no-op) If set, neato assumes nodes have already
been posi- tioned and all nodes have a pos attribute giving
the positions. It then performs an optional adjustment to
remove node-node overlap, depending on the value of the
overlap attribute, computes the edge lay- outs, depending on
the value of the splines attribute, and emits the graph in
the appropriate format. If num is supplied, the following
actions occur: num = 1 Equivalent to -n. num &gt; 1 Use node
positions as specified, with no adjustment to remove
node-node overlaps, and use any edge layouts already
specified by the pos attribute. neato computes an edge
layout for any edge that does not have a pos attribute. As
usual, edge layout is guided by the splines attribute.</p>

<p>-Klayout override the default layout engine implied by
the command name.</p>

<p>-O automatically generate output filenames based on the
input filename and the -T format.</p>

<p>-P generate a graph of the currently available
plugins.</p>

<p>-v (verbose) prints various information useful for
debugging.</p>

<p>-V (version) prints version information and exits.</p>

<p>-? prints the usage and exits.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES digraph test123 { a -&gt; b -&gt; c; a -&gt; {x
y}; b [shape=box]; c
[label=&quot;hello0orld&quot;,color=blue,fontsize=24,
fontname=&quot;Palatino-Italic&quot;,fontcolor=red,style=filled];
a -&gt; z [label=&quot;hi&quot;, weight=100]; x -&gt; z
[label=&quot;multi-line0abel&quot;]; edge
[style=dashed,color=red]; b -&gt; x; {rank=same; b x} }</p>

<p>graph test123 { a -- b -- c; a -- {x y}; x -- c
[w=10.0]; x -- y [w=5.0,len=3]; }</p>

<p>CAVEATS Edge splines can overlap unintentionally.</p>

<p>Flat edge labels are slightly broken. Intercluster edge
labels are totally broken.</p>

<p>Because unconstrained optimization is employed, node
boxes can possibly overlap or touch unrelated edges. All
existing spring embedders seem to have this limitation.</p>

<p>Apparently reasonable attempts to pin nodes or adjust
edge lengths and weights can cause instability.</p>
