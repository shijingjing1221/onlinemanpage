<p>NAME ogg123 - plays Ogg Vorbis files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ogg123 [ -vqrzZVh ] [ -k seconds ] [ -x nth ] [
-y ntimes ] [ -b buffer_size ] [ -d driver [ -o option:value
] [ -f filename ] ] file ... | directory ... | URL ...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION ogg123 reads Ogg Vorbis audio files and
decodes them to the devices specified on the command line.
By default, ogg123 writes to the stan- dard sound device,
but output can be sent to any number of devices. Files can
be read from the file system, or URLs can be streamed via
HTTP. If a directory is given, all of the files in it or its
subdirec- tories will be played.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --audio-buffer n Use an output audio buffer of
approximately n kilobytes.</p>

<p>-@ playlist, --list playlist Play all of the files named
in the file playlist. The playlist should have one filename,
directory name, or URL per line. Blank lines are permitted.
Directories will be treated in the same way as on the
command line.</p>

<p>-b n, --buffer n Use an input buffer of approximately n
kilobytes.</p>

<p>-p n, --prebuffer n Prebuffer n percent of the input
buffer. Playback wont begin until this prebuffer is
complete.</p>

<p>-d device, --device device Specify output device. See
DEVICES section for a list of devices. Any number of devices
may be specified.</p>

<p>-f filename, --file filename Specify output file for
file devices. The filename &quot;-&quot; writes to standard
out. If the file already exists, ogg123 will over- write
it.</p>

<p>-h, --help Show command help.</p>

<p>-k n, --skip n Skip the first n seconds. n may also be
in minutes:seconds or hours:minutes:seconds form.</p>

<p>-K n, --end n Stops playing n seconds from the start of
the stream. n may also have the same format as used in the
--skip option.</p>

<p>-o option:value, --device-option option:value Assigns
the option option to value for the preceding device. See
DEVICES for a list of valid options for each device.</p>

<p>-q, --quiet Quiet mode. No messages are displayed.</p>

<p>-V, --version Display version information.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose Increase verbosity.</p>

<p>-x n, --nth Play every nth decoded block. Has the effect
of playing audio at n times faster than normal speed.</p>

<p>-y n, --ntimes Repeat every played block n times. Has
the effect of playing audio n times slower than normal
speed. May be with -x for interesting fractional speeds.</p>

<p>-r, --repeat Repeat playlist indefinitely.</p>

<p>-z, --shuffle Play files in pseudo-random order.</p>

<p>-Z, --random Play files in pseudo-random order
forever.</p>

<p>DEVICES ogg123 supports a variety of audio output
devices through libao. Only those devices supported by the
target platform will be available. The -f option may only be
used with devices that write to files.</p>

<p>null Null driver. All audio data is discarded. (Note:
Audio data is not written to /dev/null !) You could use this
driver to test raw decoding speed without output
overhead.</p>

<p>alsa Advanced Linux Sound Architecture. Options:</p>

<p>dev ALSA device label to use. The system default is used
by default. Examples include &quot;plughw:0,0&quot; for the
first soundcard, and &quot;plughw:1,0&quot; for the second.
For more information, see
http://alsa.opensrc.org/ALSA+device+labels</p>

<p>buf_size Override the default buffer size (in
bytes).</p>

<p>arts aRts Sound Daemon.</p>

<p>esd Enlightened Sound Daemon. Options:</p>

<p>host The hostname where esd is running. This can include
a port number after a colon, as in
&quot;whizbang.com:555&quot;. (Default = localhost)</p>

<p>irix IRIX audio driver.</p>

<p>oss Open Sound System driver for Linux and FreeBSD.
Options:</p>

<p>dsp DSP device for soundcard. Defaults to /dev/dsp.</p>

<p>sun Sun Audio driver for NetBSD, OpenBSD, and Solaris.
Options:</p>

<p>dev Audio device for soundcard. Defaults to
/dev/audio.</p>

<p>au Sun audio file output. Writes the audio samples in AU
format. The AU format supports writing to unseekable files,
like stan- dard out. In such circumstances, the AU header
will specify the sample format, but not the length of the
recording.</p>

<p>raw Raw sample output. Writes raw audio samples to a
file. Options:</p>

<p>byteorder Choose big endian, little endian, or native
byte order. (Default = &quot;native&quot;)</p>

<p>wav WAV file output. Writes the sound data to disk in
uncompressed form. If multiple files are played, all of them
will be con- catenated into the same WAV file. WAV files
cannot be written to unseekable files, such as standard out.
Use the AU format instead.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES The ogg123 command line is fairly flexible,
perhaps confusingly so. Here are some sample command lines
and an explanation of what they do.</p>

<p>Play on the default soundcard: ogg123 test.ogg</p>

<p>Play all of the files in the directory ~/music and its
subdirectories. ogg123 ~/music</p>

<p>Play a file using the OSS driver: ogg123 -d oss
test.ogg</p>

<p>Pass the &quot;dsp&quot; option to the OSS driver:
ogg123 -d oss -o dsp:/dev/mydsp</p>

<p>Use the ESD driver ogg123 -d esd test.ogg</p>

<p>Use the WAV driver with the output file,
&quot;test.wav&quot;: ogg123 -d wav -f test.wav test.ogg</p>

<p>Listen to a file while you write it to a WAV file:
ogg123 -d oss -d wav -f test.wav test.ogg</p>

<p>Note that options apply to the device declared to the
left: ogg123 -d oss -o dsp:/dev/mydsp -d raw -f test2.raw -o
byte- order:big test.ogg</p>

<p>Stress test your harddrive: ogg123 -d oss -d wav -f
1.wav -d wav -f 2.wav -d wav -f 3.wav -d wav -f 4.wav -d wav
-f 5.wav test.ogg</p>

<p>Create an echo effect with esd and a slow computer:
ogg123 -d esd -d esd test.ogg</p>

<p>INTERRUPT You can abort ogg123 at any time by pressing
Ctrl-C. If you are play- ing multiple files, this will stop
the current file and begin playing the next one. If you want
to abort playing immediately instead of skipping to the next
file, press Ctrl-C within the first second of the playback
of a new file.</p>

<p>Note that the result of pressing Ctrl-C might not be
audible immedi- ately, due to audio data buffering in the
audio device. This delay is system dependent, but it is
usually not more than one or two seconds.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/libao.conf Can be used to set the default
output device for all libao pro- grams.</p>

<p>~/.libao Per-user config file to override the system
wide output device settings.</p>

<p>BUGS Piped WAV files may cause strange behavior in other
programs. This is because WAV files store the data length in
the header. However, the output driver does not know the
length when it writes the header, and there is no value that
means &quot;length unknown&quot;. Use the raw or au out- put
driver if you need to use ogg123 in a pipe.</p>
