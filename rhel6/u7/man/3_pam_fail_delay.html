<p>PAM_FAIL_DELAY(3) Linux-PAM Manual PAM_FAIL_DELAY(3)</p>

<p>NAME pam_fail_delay - request a delay on failure</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;security/pam_appl.h&gt;</p>

<p>int pam_fail_delay(pam_handle_t *pamh, unsigned int
usec);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pam_fail_delay function provides a
mechanism by which an application or module can suggest a
minimum delay of usec micro-seconds. The function keeps a
record of the longest time requested with this function.
Should pam_authenticate(3) fail, the failing return to the
application is delayed by an amount of time randomly
distributed (by up to 25%) about this longest value.</p>

<p>Independent of success, the delay time is reset to its
zero default value when the PAM service module returns
control to the application. The delay occurs after all
authentication modules have been called, but before control
is returned to the service application.</p>

<p>When using this function the programmer should check if
it is available with:</p>

<p>#ifdef HAVE_PAM_FAIL_DELAY .... #endif /*
HAVE_PAM_FAIL_DELAY */</p>

<p>For applications written with a single thread that are
event driven in nature, generating this delay may be
undesirable. Instead, the application may want to register
the delay in some other way. For example, in a single
threaded server that serves multiple authentication requests
from a single event loop, the application might want to
simply mark a given connection as blocked until an
application timer expires. For this reason the delay
function can be changed with the PAM_FAIL_DELAY item. It can
be queried and set with pam_get_item(3) and pam_set_item (3)
respectively. The value used to set it should be a function
pointer of the following prototype:</p>

<p>void (*delay_fn)(int retval, unsigned usec_delay, void
*appdata_ptr);</p>

<p>The arguments being the retval return code of the module
stack, the usec_delay micro-second delay that libpam is
requesting and the appdata_ptr that the application has
associated with the current pamh. This last value was set by
the application when it called pam_start(3) or explicitly
with pam_set_item(3). Note, if PAM_FAIL_DELAY item is unset
(or set to NULL), then no delay will be performed.</p>

<p>RATIONALE It is often possible to attack an
authentication scheme by exploiting the time it takes the
scheme to deny access to an applicant user. In cases of
short timeouts, it may prove possible to attempt a brute
force dictionary attack -- with an automated process, the
attacker tries all possible passwords to gain access to the
system. In other cases, where individual failures can take
measurable amounts of time (indicating the nature of the
failure), an attacker can obtain useful information about
the authentication process. These latter attacks make use of
procedural delays that constitute a covert channel of useful
information.</p>

<p>To minimize the effectiveness of such attacks, it is
desirable to introduce a random delay in a failed
authentication process. Preferable this value should be set
by the application or a special PAM module. Standard PAM
modules should not modify the delay unconditional.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE For example, a login application may require a
failure delay of roughly 3 seconds. It will contain the
following code:</p>

<p>pam_fail_delay (pamh, 3000000 /* micro-seconds */ );
pam_authenticate (pamh, 0);</p>

<p>if the modules do not request a delay, the failure delay
will be between 2.25 and 3.75 seconds.</p>

<p>However, the modules, invoked in the authentication
process, may also request delays:</p>

<p>module #1: pam_fail_delay (pamh, 2000000); module #2:
pam_fail_delay (pamh, 4000000);</p>

<p>in this case, it is the largest requested value that is
used to compute the actual failed delay: here between 3 and
5 seconds.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUES PAM_SUCCESS Delay was successful
adjusted.</p>

<p>PAM_SYSTEM_ERR A NULL pointer was submitted as PAM
handle.</p>

<p>STANDARDS The pam_fail_delay function is an Linux-PAM
extension.</p>
