<p>unconfined_mono_selinux(SELinux Policy
unconfined_mounconfined_mono_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME unconfined_mono_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux
Policy for the uncon- fined_mono processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the
unconfined_mono processes via flex- ible mandatory access
control.</p>

<p>The unconfined_mono processes execute with the
unconfined_mono_t SELinux type. You can check if you have
these processes running by exe- cuting the ps command with
the -Z qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep unconfined_mono_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The unconfined_mono_t SELinux type can be
entered via the file_type, unlabeled_t, proc_type,
filesystem_type, mtrr_device_t, mono_exec_t, sysctl_type,
xsession_exec_t file types.</p>

<p>The default entrypoint paths for the unconfined_mono_t
domain are the following:</p>

<p>all files on the system, /dev/cpu/mtrr, /usr/bin/mono.*,
/etc/kde3?/kdm/Xreset, /etc/kde3?/kdm/Xstartup,
/etc/kde3?/kdm/Xses- sion, /etc/X11/[wx]dm/Xreset.*,
/etc/X11/[wxg]dm/Xsession, /etc/X11/Xsession[^/]*,
/etc/X11/wdm/Xsetup.*, /etc/X11/wdm/Xstartup.*</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux unconfined_mono policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their unconfined_mono processes in
as secure a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for
unconfined_mono:</p>

<p>unconfined_mono_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a unconfined_mono_t can be
used to make the process type unconfined_mono_t permissive.
SELinux does not deny access to permissive process types,
but the AVC (SELinux denials) messages are still
generated.</p>

<p>BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable based on least
access required. uncon- fined_mono policy is extremely
flexible and has several booleans that allow you to
manipulate the policy and run unconfined_mono with the
tightest access possible.</p>

<p>If you want to allow direct login to the console device.
Required for System 390, you must turn on the
allow_console_login boolean. Enabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_console_login 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow all domains to use other domains
file descriptors, you must turn on the allow_domain_fd_use
boolean. Enabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_domain_fd_use 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow unconfined executables to make
their heap memory executable. Doing this is a really bad
idea. Probably indicates a badly coded executable, but could
indicate an attack. This executable should be reported in
bugzilla, you must turn on the allow_execheap boolean.
Disabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_execheap 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow unconfined executables to map a
memory region as both executable and writable, this is
dangerous and the executable should be reported in
bugzilla), you must turn on the allow_execmem boolean.
Enabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_execmem 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow all unconfined executables to use
libraries requiring text relocation that are not labeled
textrel_shlib_t), you must turn on the allow_execmod
boolean. Enabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_execmod 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow unconfined executables to make
their stack exe- cutable. This should never, ever be
necessary. Probably indicates a badly coded executable, but
could indicate an attack. This executable should be reported
in bugzilla), you must turn on the allow_execstack boolean.
Enabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_execstack 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow confined applications to run with
kerberos, you must turn on the allow_kerberos boolean.
Enabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_kerberos 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow sysadm to debug or ptrace all
processes, you must turn on the allow_ptrace boolean.
Disabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_ptrace 1</p>

<p>If you want to transition to confined nsplugin domains
from unconfined user, you must turn on the
allow_unconfined_nsplugin_transition boolean. Disabled by
default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_unconfined_nsplugin_transition 1</p>

<p>If you want to allows clients to write to the X server
shared memory segments, you must turn on the
allow_write_xshm boolean. Disabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_write_xshm 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow system to run with NIS, you must
turn on the allow_ypbind boolean. Disabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_ypbind 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow all domains to have the kernel load
modules, you must turn on the domain_kernel_load_modules
boolean. Disabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P domain_kernel_load_modules 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow all domains to execute in
fips_mode, you must turn on the fips_mode boolean. Enabled
by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P fips_mode 1</p>

<p>If you want to enable reading of urandom for all
domains, you must turn on the global_ssp boolean. Disabled
by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P global_ssp 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow certain domains to map low memory
in the kernel, you must turn on the mmap_low_allowed
boolean. Disabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P mmap_low_allowed 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow confined applications to use nscd
shared memory, you must turn on the nscd_use_shm boolean.
Enabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P nscd_use_shm 1</p>

<p>If you want to enabling secure mode disallows programs,
such as new- role, from transitioning to administrative user
domains, you must turn on the secure_mode boolean. Disabled
by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P secure_mode 1</p>

<p>If you want to boolean to determine whether the system
permits loading policy, setting enforcing mode, and changing
boolean values. Set this to true and you have to reboot to
set it back, you must turn on the secure_mode_policyload
boolean. Disabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P secure_mode_policyload 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow ssh logins as sysadm_r:sysadm_t,

default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P ssh_sysadm_login 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow unconfined users to transition to
the Mozilla plu- gin domain when running xulrunner
plugin-container, you must turn on the

default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P unconfined_mozilla_plugin_transition 1</p>

access, you must turn on the user_direct_dri boolean.
Enabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P user_direct_dri 1</p>

<p>setsebool -P xserver_object_manager 1</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type unconfined_mono_t
can manage files labeled with the following file types. The
paths listed are the default paths for these file types.
Note the processes UID still need to have DAC
permissions.</p>

<p>file_type</p>

<p>all files on the system</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage boolean can also be used to manipulate the
booleans</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
