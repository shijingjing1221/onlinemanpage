<p>AUTOFSD-PROBE(1) AUTOFSD-PROBE(1)</p>

<p>NAME autofsd-probe - probe AutoFS mount/unmount
daemon</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS $PCP_BINADM_DIR/autofsd-probe [-h host] [-t
timeout]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION autofsd-probe will check the status of the
autofsd(1) daemon on the specified host.</p>

<p>Unless directed to another host by the -h option,
autofsd-probe will contact the AutoFS daemon on the local
host.</p>

<p>The AutoFS file system is built on the Remote Procedure
Call (RPC(3)) library routines. The -t option allows the
total timeout and retry timeout intervals to be set for all
remote procedure call operations used with autofsd-probe.
This option accepts an interval argument in the form
described in the PCPintro(1) manual page.</p>

<p>autofsd-probe is typically used in an automated fashion
from within pmdashping(1) and in conjunction with pmie(1),
for monitoring response time and service failure.</p>

<p>By default autofsd-probe will not produce any output,
unless there is an error in which case a diagnostic message
will be displayed and the exit status will indicate the
reason for failure.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS If autofsd-probe succeeds, then 0 will be
returned. If the attempt to establish a connection with
autofsd fails, then 2 is returned. If the subsequent attempt
to invoke an autofsd response fails, then 1 will be
returned.</p>

<p>In the case of a syntactical command line error, 4 is
returned and the usage message is displayed.</p>

<p>PCP ENVIRONMENT Environment variables with the prefix
PCP_ are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP. On each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in pcp.conf(5).</p>
