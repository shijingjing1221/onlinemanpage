<p>MKDIR(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual MKDIR(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME mkdir - make directories</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS mkdir [-p][-m mode] dir...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The mkdir utility shall create the
directories specified by the operands, in the order
specified.</p>

<p>For each dir operand, the mkdir utility shall perform
actions equiva- lent to the mkdir() function defined in the
System Interfaces volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, called
with the following arguments:</p>

<p>1. The dir operand is used as the path argument.</p>

<p>2. The value of the bitwise-inclusive OR of S_IRWXU,
S_IRWXG, and S_IRWXO is used as the mode argument. (If the
-m option is speci- fied, the mode option-argument overrides
this default.)</p>

<p>OPTIONS The mkdir utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>The following options shall be supported:</p>

<p>-m mode Set the file permission bits of the
newly-created directory to the specified mode value. The
mode option-argument shall be the same as the mode operand
defined for the chmod utility. In the symbolic_mode strings,
the op characters+and- shall be interpreted relative to an
assumed initial mode of a= rwx; + shall add permissions to
the default mode,-shall delete per- missions from the
default mode.</p>

<p>-p Create any missing intermediate pathname
components.</p>

<p>For each dir operand that does not name an existing
directory, effects equivalent to those caused by the
following command shall occur:</p>

<p>mkdir -p -m $(umask -S),u+wx $(dirname dir) &amp;&amp;
mkdir [-m mode] dir</p>

<p>where the -m mode option represents that option supplied
to the origi- nal invocation of mkdir, if any.</p>

<p>Each dir operand that names an existing directory shall
be ignored without error.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p>dir A pathname of a directory to be created.</p>

<p>STDIN Not used.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of mkdir:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in
arguments).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT Not used.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 All the specified directories were created
successfully or the -p option was specified and all the
specified directories now exist.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The default file mode for directories
is a= rwx (777 on most systems) with selected permissions
removed in accordance with the file mode cre- ation mask.
For intermediate pathname components created by mkdir, the
mode is the default modified by u+ wx so that the
subdirectories can always be created regardless of the file
mode creation mask; if differ- ent ultimate permissions are
desired for the intermediate directories, they can be
changed afterwards with chmod.</p>

<p>Note that some of the requested directories may have
been created even if an error occurs.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The System V -m option was included to control
the file mode.</p>

<p>The System V -p option was included to create any needed
intermediate directories and to complement the functionality
provided by rmdir for removing directories in the path
prefix as they become empty. Because no error is produced if
any path component already exists, the -p option is also
useful to ensure that a particular directory exists.</p>

<p>The functionality of mkdir is described substantially
through a refer- ence to the mkdir() function in the System
Interfaces volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001. For example, by
default, the mode of the direc- tory is affected by the file
mode creation mask in accordance with the specified behavior
of the mkdir() function. In this way, there is less
duplication of effort required for describing details of the
directory creation.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
