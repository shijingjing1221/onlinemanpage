<p>SNMPNETSTAT(1) Net-SNMP SNMPNETSTAT(1)</p>

<p>NAME snmpnetstat - display networking status and
configuration information from a network entity via SNMP</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS snmpnetstat [common options] [-Ca] [-Cn] AGENT
snmpnetstat [common options] [-Ci] [-Co] [-Cr] [-Cn] [-Cs]
AGENT snmpnetstat [common options] [-Ci] [-Cn] [-CI
interface] AGENT [inter- val] snmpnetstat [common options]
[-Ca] [-Cn] [-Cs] [-Cp protocol] AGENT</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The snmpnetstat command symbolically
displays the values of various network-related information
retrieved from a remote system using the SNMP protocol.
There are a number of output formats, depending on the
options for the information presented. The first form of the
command displays a list of active sockets. The second form
presents the values of other network-related information
according to the option selected. Using the third form, with
an interval specified, snmpnetstat will con- tinuously
display the information regarding packet traffic on the con-
figured network interfaces. The fourth form displays
statistics about the named protocol.</p>

<p>snmpnetstat will issue GETBULK requests to query for
information if at least protocol version v2 is used.</p>

<p>AGENT identifies a target SNMP agent, which is
instrumented to monitor the given objects. At its simplest,
the AGENT specification will con- sist of a hostname or an
IPv4 address. In this situation, the command will attempt
communication with the agent, using UDP/IPv4 to port 161 of
the given target host. See snmpcmd(1) for a full list of the
possi- ble formats for AGENT.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The options have the following meaning:</p>

<p>common options Please see snmpcmd(1) for a list of
possible values for common options as well as their
descriptions.</p>

<p>-Ca With the default display, show the state of all
sockets; normally sockets used by server processes are not
shown.</p>

<p>-Ci Show the state of all of the network interfaces. The
interface display provides a table of cumulative statistics
regarding packets transferred, errors, and collisions. The
network addresses of the interface and the maximum
transmission unit (mtu) are also dis- played.</p>

<p>-Co Show an abbreviated interface status, giving octets
in place of packets. This is useful when enquiring virtual
interfaces (such as Frame-Relay circuits) on a router.</p>

<p>-CI interface Show information only about this
interface; used with an interval as described below.</p>

<p>-Cn Show network addresses as numbers (normally
snmpnetstat interprets addresses and attempts to display
them symbolically). This option may be used with any of the
display formats.</p>

<p>-Cp protocol Show statistics about protocol, which is
either a well- known name for a protocol or an alias for it.
Some protocol names and aliases are listed in the file
/etc/protocols. A null response typi- cally means that there
are no interesting numbers to report. The pro- gram will
complain if protocol is unknown or if there is no statistics
routine for it.</p>

<p>-Cs Show per-protocol statistics. When used with the -Cr
option, show routing statistics instead.</p>

<p>-Cr Show the routing tables. When -Cs is also present,
show per-proto- col routing statistics instead of the
routing tables.</p>

<p>-CR repeaters For GETBULK requests, repeaters specifies
the max- repeaters value to use.</p>

<p>When snmpnetstat is invoked with an interval argument,
it displays a running count of statistics related to network
interfaces. interval is the number of seconds between
reporting of statistics.</p>

<p>The Active Sockets Display (default)</p>

<p>The default display, for active sockets, shows the local
and remote addresses, protocol, and the internal state of
the protocol. Address formats are of the form host.port or
net- work.port if a sockets address specifies a network but
no spe- cific host address. When known, the host and network
addresses are displayed symbolically according to the data
bases /etc/hosts and /etc/networks, respectively. If a
symbolic name for an address is unknown, or if the -Cn
option is specified, the address is printed numerically,
according to the address family. For more information
regarding the Internet dot format, refer to inet(3N).
Unspeci- fied, or wildcard, addresses and ports appear as
*.</p>

<p>The Interface Display</p>

<p>The interface display provides a table of cumulative
statistics regarding packets transferred, errors, and col-
lisions. The network addresses of the interface and the
maximum transmission unit (mtu) are also displayed.</p>

<p>The Routing Table Display</p>

<p>The routing table display indicates the available routes
and their status. Each route consists of a destination host
or network and a gateway to use in forwarding pack- ets. The
flags field shows the state of the route (U if up), whether
the route is to a gateway ( G ), whether the route was
created dynamically by a redirect ( D ), and whether the
route has been modified by a redirect (M). Direct routes are
created for each interface attached to the local host; the
gateway field for such entries shows the address of the
outgoing inter- face. The interface entry indicates the
network interface utilized for the route.</p>

<p>The Interface Display with an Interval</p>

<p>When snmpnetstat is invoked with an interval argument,
it displays a running count of statistics related to network
interfaces. This display consists of a column for the
primary interface and a column summarizing information for
all interfaces. The primary interface may be replaced with
another interface with the -CI option. The first line of
each screen of information contains a summary since the
system was last rebooted. Subsequent lines of output show
values accumulated over the preceding interval.</p>

<p>The Active Sockets Display for a Single Protocol</p>

<p>When a protocol is specified with the -Cp option, the
information dis- played is similar to that in the default
display for active sockets, except the display is limited to
the given protocol.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Example of using snmpnetstat to display active
sockets (default):</p>

<p>% snmpnetstat -v 2c -c public -Ca testhost</p>

<p>Active Internet (tcp) Connections (including servers)
Proto Local Address Foreign Address (state) tcp *.echo *.*
LISTEN tcp *.discard *.* LISTEN tcp *.daytime *.* LISTEN tcp
*.chargen *.* LISTEN tcp *.ftp *.* LISTEN tcp *.telnet *.*
LISTEN tcp *.smtp *.* LISTEN ...</p>

<p>Active Internet (udp) Connections Proto Local Address
udp *.echo udp *.discard udp *.daytime udp *.chargen udp
*.time ...</p>

<p>% snmpnetstat -v 2c -c public -Ci testhost</p>

<p>Name Mtu Network Address Ipkts Ierrs Opkts Oerrs Queue
eri0 1500 10.6.9/24 testhost 170548881 245601 687976 0 0 lo0
8232 127 localhost 7530982 0 7530982 0 0</p>

<p>Example of using snmpnetstat to show statistics about a
specific proto- col:</p>

<p>% snmpnetstat -v 2c -c public -Cp tcp testhost</p>

<p>Active Internet (tcp) Connections Proto Local Address
Foreign Address (state) tcp *.echo *.* LISTEN tcp *.discard
*.* LISTEN tcp *.daytime *.* LISTEN tcp *.chargen *.* LISTEN
tcp *.ftp *.* LISTEN tcp *.telnet *.* LISTEN tcp *.smtp *.*
LISTEN ...</p>

<p>BUGS The notion of errors is ill-defined.</p>
