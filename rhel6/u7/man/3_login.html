<p>NAME login, logout - write utmp and wtmp entries</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;utmp.h&gt;</p>

<p>void login(const struct utmp *ut);</p>

<p>int logout(const char *ut_line);</p>

<p>Link with -lutil.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The utmp file records who is currently using
the system. The wtmp file records all logins and logouts.
See utmp(5).</p>

<p>The function login() takes the supplied struct utmp, ut,
and writes it to both the utmp and the wtmp file.</p>

<p>The function logout() clears the entry in the utmp file
again.</p>

<p>GNU Details More precisely, login() takes the argument
ut struct, fills the field ut-&gt;ut_type (if there is such
a field) with the value USER_PROCESS, and fills the field
ut-&gt;ut_pid (if there is such a field) with the process ID
of the calling process. Then it tries to fill the field
ut-&gt;ut_line. It takes the first of stdin, stdout, stderr
that is a tty, and stores the corresponding pathname minus a
possible leading /dev/ into this field, and then writes the
struct to the utmp file. On the other hand, if no tty name
was found, this field is filled with &quot;???&quot; and the
struct is not written to the utmp file. After this, the
struct is written to the wtmp file.</p>

<p>The logout() function searches the utmp file for an
entry matching the ut_line argument. If a record is found,
it is updated by zeroing out the ut_name and ut_host fields,
updating the ut_tv timestamp field and setting ut_type (if
there is such a field) to DEAD_PROCESS.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The logout() function returns 1 if the
entry was successfully written to the database, or 0 if an
error occurred.</p>

<p>FILES /var/run/utmp user accounting database, configured
through _PATH_UTMP in &lt;paths.h&gt;</p>

<p>/var/log/wtmp user accounting log file, configured
through _PATH_WTMP in &lt;paths.h&gt;</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO Not in POSIX.1-2001. Present on the
BSDs.</p>

<p>NOTES Note that the member ut_user of struct utmp is
called ut_name in BSD. Therefore, ut_name is defined as an
alias for ut_user in &lt;utmp.h&gt;.</p>
