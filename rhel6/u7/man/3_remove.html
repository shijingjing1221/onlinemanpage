<p>REMOVE(3) Linux Programmer s Manual REMOVE(3)</p>

<p>NAME remove - remove a file or directory</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</p>

<p>int remove(const char *pathname);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION remove() deletes a name from the file
system. It calls unlink(2) for files, and rmdir(2) for
directories.</p>

<p>If the removed name was the last link to a file and no
processes have the file open, the file is deleted and the
space it was using is made available for reuse.</p>

<p>If the name was the last link to a file, but any
processes still have the file open, the file will remain in
existence until the last file descriptor referring to it is
closed.</p>

<p>If the name referred to a symbolic link, the link is
removed.</p>

<p>If the name referred to a socket, FIFO, or device, the
name is removed, but processes which have the object open
may continue to use it.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, zero is returned. On error, -1
is returned, and errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS The errors that occur are those for unlink(2) and
rmdir(2).</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO C89, C99, 4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>NOTES Under libc4 and libc5, remove() was an alias for
unlink(2) (and hence would not remove directories).</p>

<p>BUGS Infelicities in the protocol underlying NFS can
cause the unexpected disappearance of files which are still
being used.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO rm(1), unlink(1), link(2), mknod(2), open(2),
rename(2), rmdir(2), unlink(2), mkfifo(3), symlink(7)</p>
