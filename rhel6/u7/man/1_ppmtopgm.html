<p>NAME ppmtopgm - convert a PPM image to a PGM image</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ppmtopgm</p>

<p>[ppmfile]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>ppmtopgm reads a PPM as input and produces a PGM as
output. The output is a black and white rendering of the
original image, as in a black and white photograph. The
quantization formula ppmtopgm uses is g = .299 r + .587 g +
.114 b.</p>

<p>Note that although there is a pgmtoppm program, it is
not necessary for simple conversions from pgm to ppm ,
because any ppm program can read pgm (and pbm ) files
automatically. pgmtoppm is for colorizing a pgm file. Also,
see ppmtorgb3 for a different way of converting color to
gray. And ppmdist generates a grayscale image from a color
image, but in a way that makes it easy to differentiate the
original colors, not necessarily a way that looks like a
black and white photograph.</p>

<p>QUOTE Cold-hearted orb that rules the night Removes the
colors from our sight Red is gray, and yellow white But we
decide which is right And which is a quantization error.</p>
