<p>PMDASUMMARY(1) PMDASUMMARY(1)</p>

<p>NAME pmdasummary - summary performance metrics domain
agent (PMDA)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/summary/pmdasummary [-d domain]
[-h helpfile] [-l log- file] [-U username]
pmie-command-line</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pmdasummary is a Performance Metrics Domain
Agent (PMDA) which derives performance metrics values from
values made available by other PMDAs. pmdasummary consists
of two processes:</p>

<p>pmie process The inference engine for performance values
pmie(1) is used to periodically sample values for the base
metrics and compute the derived values. This process is
launched with the given pmie- command-line arguments by the
main process, described below.</p>

<p>main process The main process reads and buffers the
values computed by pmie(1) and makes them available to the
performance metrics col- lector daemon pmcd(1).</p>

<p>A brief description of the pmdasummary command line
options follows:</p>

<p>-d It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics
domain num- ber specified here is unique and consistent.
That is, domain should be different for every PMDA on the
one host, and the same domain number should be used for the
same PMDA on all hosts.</p>

<p>-h This option specifies an alternative help text file
helpfile for describing the metrics that pmdasummary
represents.</p>

<p>-l Location of the log file. By default, a log file
named sum- mary.log is written in the current directory of
pmcd(1) when pmda- summary is started, i.e.
$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd. If the log file can- not be created or is
not writable, output is written to the stan- dard error
instead.</p>

<p>-U User account under which to run the agent. The
default is the unprivileged &quot;pcp&quot; account in
current versions of PCP, but in older versions the superuser
account (&quot;root&quot;) was used by default.</p>

<p>INSTALLATION If you want access to the names, help text
and values for the summary performance metrics, do the
following as root:</p>

<p># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/summary # ./Install</p>

<p>If you want to undo the installation, do the following
as root:</p>

<p># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/summary # ./Remove</p>

<p>pmdasummary is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be
executed directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify
pmcd(1) when the agent is installed or removed.</p>

<p>FILES $PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH command line options used to
launch pmdasummary $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/summary/expr.pmie default
pmie(1) expressions defining the summary metrics
$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/summary/help default help text for the
summary metrics $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/summary/Install installation
script for the pmdasummary agent
$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/summary/Remove undo installation script for
the pmdasummary agent $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/summary.log default
log file for error messages and other information from
pmdasummary</p>

<p>PCP ENVIRONMENT Environment variables with the prefix
PCP_ are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP. On each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in pcp.conf(5).</p>
