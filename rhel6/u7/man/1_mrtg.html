<p>NAME mrtg - What is MRTG ?</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The Multi Router Traffic Grapher (MRTG) is a
tool to monitor the traf- fic load on network links. MRTG
generates HTML pages containing PNG images which provide a
LIVE visual representation of this traffic. Check
http://www.stat.ee.ethz.ch/mrtg/ to see what it does.</p>

<p>Go to http://oss.oetiker.ch/mrtg for all the details
about mrtg.</p>

<p>HIGHLIGHTS Portable MRTG works on most UNIX platforms
and Windows NT.</p>

<p>Perl MRTG is written in Perl and comes with full
source.</p>

<p>Portable SNMP MRTG Uses a highly portable SNMP
implementation written entirely in Perl (thanks to Simon
Leinen). There is no need to install any external SNMP
package.</p>

<p>SNMPv2c support MRTG can read the new SNMPv2c 64bit
counters. No more counter wrap- ping.</p>

<p>Reliable Interface Identification Router interfaces can
be identified by IP address, description and ethernet
address in addition to the normal interface number.</p>

<p>Constant size Logfiles MRTGs logfiles do NOT grow thanks
to the use of a unique data con- solidation algorithm.</p>

<p>Automatic Configuration MRTG comes with a set of
configuration tools which make configura- tion and setup
very simple.</p>

<p>Performance Time critical routines are written in C
(thanks to the initiative of Dave Rand my Co-Author).</p>

<p>GIF free Graphics Graphics are generated directly in PNG
format using the GD library by Thomas Boutell.</p>

<p>Customizability The look of the webpages produced by
MRTG is highly configurable.</p>

<p>RRDtool MRTG has built-in hooks for using RRDtool. If
you are strapped for performance this may help.</p>

<p>DETAILS MRTG consists of a Perl script which uses SNMP
to read the traffic counters of your routers and a fast C
program which logs the traffic data and creates beautiful
graphs representing the traffic on the moni- tored network
connection. These graphs are embedded into webpages which
can be viewed from any modern Web-browser.</p>

<p>In addition to a detailed daily view, MRTG also creates
visual repre- sentations of the traffic seen during the last
seven days, the last five weeks and the last twelve months.
This is possible because MRTG keeps a log of all the data it
has pulled from the router. This log is automatically
consolidated so that it does not grow over time, but still
contains all the relevant data for all the traffic seen over
the last two years. This is all performed in an efficient
manner. There- fore you can monitor 200 or more network
links from any halfway decent UNIX box.</p>

<p>MRTG is not limited to monitoring traffic, though. It is
possible to monitor any SNMP variable you choose. You can
even use an external pro- gram to gather the data which
should be monitored via MRTG. People are using MRTG, to
monitor things such as System Load, Login Sessions, Modem
availability and more. MRTG even allows you to accumulate
two or more data sources into a single graph.</p>

<p>HISTORY In 1994 I was working at a site where we had one
64kbit line to the outside world. Obviously, everybody was
interested in knowing how the link was performing. So I
wrote a quick hack which created a constantly updated graph
on the web that showed the traffic load on our Internet
link. This eventually evolved into a rather configurable
Perl script called MRTG-1.0 which I released in spring 1995.
After a few updates, I left my job at DMU to start work at
the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology. Due to lack of
time I had to put MRTG aside. One day in January of 1996, I
received email from Dave Rand asking if I had any ideas why
MRTG was so slow. Actually, I did. MRTG s programming was
not very efficient and it was written entirely in Perl.
After a week or so, Dave wrote back to me and said he had
tried what I had suggested for improving MRTG s speed. Since
the changes did not help much, he had decided to rewrite the
time-critical sections of MRTG in C. The code was attached
to his email. His tool increased the speed of MRTG by a
factor of 40! This got me out of my MRTG ignorance and I
started to spend my spare time developing of MRTG-2.</p>

<p>Soon after MRTG-2 development had begun I started to
give beta copies to interested parties. In return I got many
feature patches, a lot of user feedback and bug fixes. The
product you are getting now wouldnt be in this state if it
hadn t been for the great contributions and sup- port I
received from of many people. I would like to take this
opportu- nity to thank them all. (See the files CHANGES for
a long list of folk people who helped to make MRTG what it
is today.)</p>

<p>Command-line Mrtg is also the name of the script you
have to run to poll data and generate the graphs. Most
configuration is set through the configura- tion file; some
command-line options exist all the same.</p>

<p>--user username and --group groupname Run as the given
user and/or group. (Unix Only)</p>

<p>--lock-file filename Use an alternate lock-file (the
default is to use the configura- tion-file appended with
&quot;_l&quot;).</p>

<p>--confcache-file filename Use an alternate
confcache-file (the default is to use the configu-
ration-file appended with &quot;.ok&quot;)</p>

<p>--logging filename|eventlog If this is set to writable
filename, all output from mrtg (warn- ings, debug messages,
errors) will go to filename. If you are run- ning on Win32
you can specify eventlog instead of a filename which will
send all error to the windows event log.</p>

<p>NOTE:Note, there is no Message DLL for mrtg. This has
the side effect that the windows event logger will display a
nice message with every entry in the event log, complaing
about the fact that mrtg has no message dll. If any of the
Windows folks want to con- tribute one, they are
welcome.</p>

<p>--daemon Put MRTG into the background, running as a
daemon. This works the same way as the config file option,
but the switch is required for proper FHS operation (because
/var/run is writable only by root)</p>

<p>--fhs Configure all mrtg paths to conform to the FHS
specification; http://www.pathname.com/fhs/</p>

<p>--check Only check the cfg file for errors. Do not do
anything.</p>

<p>--pid-file=s Define the name and path of the pid file
for mrtg running as a dae- mon</p>

<p>--log-only Only update the logfile, do not produce
graphics or html pages</p>

<p>--debug=s Enable debug options. The argument of the
debug option is a comma separated list of debug values:</p>

<p>cfg - watch the config file reading dir - directory
mangeling base - basic program flow tarp - target parser
snpo - snmp polling fork - forking view time - some timing
info log - logging of data via rateup or rrdtool</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>--debug=&quot;cfg,snpo&quot;</p>
