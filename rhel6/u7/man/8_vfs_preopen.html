<p>NAME vfs_preopen - Hide read latencies for applications
reading numbered files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS vfs objects = preopen</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This VFS module is part of the samba(7)
suite.</p>

<p>This module assists applications that want to read
numbered files in sequence with very strict latency
requirements. One area where this happens in video streaming
applications that want to read one file per frame.</p>

<p>When you use this module, a number of helper processes
is started that speculatively open files and read a number
of bytes to prime the file system cache, so that later on
when the real application&rsquo;s request comes along, no
disk access is necessary.</p>

<p>This module is stackable.</p>

<p>OPTIONS preopen:names = /pattern/ preopen:names
specifies the file name pattern which should trigger the
preopen helpers to do their work. We assume that the files
are numbered incrementally. So if your file names are
numbered FRAME00000.frm FRAME00001.frm and so on you would
list them as preopen:names=/FRAME*.frm/</p>

<p>preopen:num_bytes = BYTES Specifies the number of bytes
the helpers should speculatively read, defaults to 1.</p>

<p>preopen:helpers = NUM-PROCS Number of forked helper
processes, defaults to 1.</p>

<p>preopen:queuelen = NUM-FILES Number of files that should
be speculatively opened. Defaults to the 10 subsequent
files.</p>

<p>VERSION This man page is correct for version 3.3 of the
Samba suite.</p>

<p>AUTHOR The original Samba software and related utilities
were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by
the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way
the Linux kernel is developed.</p>

<p>The PREOPEN VFS module was created with contributions
from Volker Lendecke and the developers at IBM.</p>
