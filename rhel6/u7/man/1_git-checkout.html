<p>GIT-CHECKOUT(1) Git Manual GIT-CHECKOUT(1)</p>

<p>NAME git-checkout - Checkout a branch or paths to the
working tree</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS git checkout [-q] [-f] [-m] [&lt;branch&gt;]
git checkout [-q] [-f] [-m] [-b &lt;new_branch&gt;]
[&lt;start_point&gt;] git checkout
[-f|--ours|--theirs|-m|--conflict=&lt;style&gt;]
[&lt;tree-ish&gt;] [--] &lt;paths&gt;... git checkout
--patch [&lt;tree-ish&gt;] [--] [&lt;paths&gt;...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION When &lt;paths&gt; are not given, this
command switches branches by updating the index, working
tree, and HEAD to reflect the specified branch.</p>

<p>If -b is given, a new branch is created and checked out,
as if git- branch(1) were called; in this case you can use
the --track or --no-track options, which will be passed to
git branch. As a convenience, --track without -b implies
branch creation; see the description of --track below.</p>

<p>When &lt;paths&gt; or --patch are given, this command
does not switch branches. It updates the named paths in the
working tree from the index file, or from a named
&lt;tree-ish&gt; (most often a commit). In this case, the -b
and --track options are meaningless and giving either of
them results in an error. The &lt;tree-ish&gt; argument can
be used to specify a specific tree-ish (i.e. commit, tag or
tree) to update the index for the given paths before
updating the working tree.</p>

<p>The index may contain unmerged entries after a failed
merge. By default, if you try to check out such an entry
from the index, the checkout operation will fail and nothing
will be checked out. Using -f will ignore these unmerged
entries. The contents from a specific side of the merge can
be checked out of the index by using --ours or --theirs.
With -m, changes made to the working tree file can be
discarded to recreate the original conflicted merge
result.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -q, --quiet Quiet, suppress feedback
messages.</p>

<p>-f, --force When switching branches, proceed even if the
index or the working tree differs from HEAD. This is used to
throw away local changes.</p>

<p>When checking out paths from the index, do not fail upon
unmerged entries; instead, unmerged entries are ignored.</p>

<p>--ours, --theirs When checking out paths from the index,
check out stage #2 (ours) or #3 (theirs) for unmerged
paths.</p>

<p>-b Create a new branch named &lt;new_branch&gt; and
start it at &lt;start_point&gt;; see git-branch(1) for
details.</p>

<p>-t, --track When creating a new branch, set up
&quot;upstream&quot; configuration. See &quot;--track&quot;
in git-branch(1) for details.</p>

<p>If no -b option is given, the name of the new branch
will be derived from the remote branch. If
&quot;remotes/&quot; or &quot;refs/remotes/&quot; is
prefixed it is stripped away, and then the part up to the
next slash (which would be the nickname of the remote) is
removed. This would tell us to use &quot;hack&quot; as the
local branch when branching off of &quot;origin/hack&quot;
(or &quot;remotes/origin/hack&quot;, or even
&quot;refs/remotes/origin/hack&quot;). If the given name has
no slash, or the above guessing results in an empty name,
the guessing is aborted. You can explicitly give a name with
-b in such a case.</p>

<p>--no-track Do not set up &quot;upstream&quot;
configuration, even if the branch.autosetupmerge
configuration variable is true.</p>

<p>-l Create the new branchs reflog; see git-branch(1) for
details.</p>

<p>-m, --merge When switching branches, if you have local
modifications to one or more files that are different
between the current branch and the branch to which you are
switching, the command refuses to switch branches in order
to preserve your modifications in context. However, with
this option, a three-way merge between the current branch,
your working tree contents, and the new branch is done, and
you will be on the new branch.</p>

<p>When a merge conflict happens, the index entries for
conflicting paths are left unmerged, and you need to resolve
the conflicts and mark the resolved paths with git add (or
git rm if the merge should result in deletion of the
path).</p>

<p>When checking out paths from the index, this option lets
you recreate the conflicted merge in the specified
paths.</p>

<p>--conflict=&lt;style&gt; The same as --merge option
above, but changes the way the conflicting hunks are
presented, overriding the merge.conflictstyle configuration
variable. Possible values are &quot;merge&quot; (default)
and &quot;diff3&quot; (in addition to what is shown by
&quot;merge&quot; style, shows the original contents).</p>

<p>-p, --patch Interactively select hunks in the difference
between the &lt;tree-ish&gt; (or the index, if unspecified)
and the working tree. The chosen hunks are then applied in
reverse to the working tree (and if a &lt;tree-ish&gt; was
specified, the index).</p>

<p>This means that you can use git checkout -p to
selectively discard edits from your current working
tree.</p>

<p>&lt;branch&gt; Branch to checkout; if it refers to a
branch (i.e., a name that, when prepended with
&quot;refs/heads/&quot;, is a valid ref), then that branch
is checked out. Otherwise, if it refers to a valid commit,
your HEAD becomes &quot;detached&quot; and you are no longer
on any branch (see below for details).</p>

<p>As a special case, the &quot;@{-N}&quot; syntax for the
N-th last branch checks out the branch (instead of
detaching). You may also specify - which is synonymous with
&quot;@{-1}&quot;.</p>

<p>&lt;new_branch&gt; Name for the new branch.</p>

<p>&lt;start_point&gt; The name of a commit at which to
start the new branch; see git- branch(1) for details.
Defaults to HEAD.</p>

<p>&lt;tree-ish&gt; Tree to checkout from (when paths are
given). If not specified, the index will be used.</p>

<p>DETACHED HEAD It is sometimes useful to be able to
checkout a commit that is not at the tip of one of your
branches. The most obvious example is to check out the
commit at a tagged official release point, like this:</p>

<p>$ git checkout v2.6.18</p>

<p>Earlier versions of git did not allow this and asked you
to create a temporary branch using the -b option, but
starting from version 1.5.0, the above command detaches your
HEAD from the current branch and directly points at the
commit named by the tag (v2.6.18 in the example above).</p>

<p>You can use all git commands while in this state. You
can use git reset --hard $othercommit to further move
around, for example. You can make changes and create a new
commit on top of a detached HEAD. You can even create a
merge by using git merge $othercommit.</p>

<p>The state you are in while your HEAD is detached is not
recorded by any branch (which is natural --- you are not on
any branch). What this means is that you can discard your
temporary commits and merges by switching back to an
existing branch (e.g. git checkout master), and a later git
prune or git gc would garbage-collect them. If you did this
by mistake, you can ask the reflog for HEAD where you were,
e.g.</p>

<p>$ git log -g -2 HEAD</p>

<p>EXAMPLES 1. The following sequence checks out the master
branch, reverts the Makefile to two revisions back, deletes
hello.c by mistake, and gets it back from the index.</p>

<p>$ git checkout master (1) $ git checkout master~2
Makefile (2) $ rm -f hello.c $ git checkout hello.c (3)</p>

<p>1. switch branch 2. take a file out of another commit 3.
restore hello.c from the index</p>

<p>If you have an unfortunate branch that is named hello.c,
this step would be confused as an instruction to switch to
that branch. You should instead write:</p>

<p>$ git checkout -- hello.c</p>

<p>2. After working in the wrong branch, switching to the
correct branch would be done using:</p>

<p>$ git checkout mytopic</p>

<p>However, your &quot;wrong&quot; branch and correct
&quot;mytopic&quot; branch may differ in files that you have
modified locally, in which case the above checkout would
fail like this:</p>

<p>$ git checkout mytopic fatal: Entry &acute;frotz&acute;
not uptodate. Cannot merge.</p>

<p>You can give the -m flag to the command, which would try
a three-way merge:</p>

<p>$ git checkout -m mytopic Auto-merging frotz</p>

<p>After this three-way merge, the local modifications are
not registered in your index file, so git diff would show
you what changes you made since the tip of the new
branch.</p>

<p>3. When a merge conflict happens during switching
branches with the -m option, you would see something like
this:</p>

<p>$ git checkout -m mytopic Auto-merging frotz ERROR:
Merge conflict in frotz fatal: merge program failed</p>

<p>At this point, git diff shows the changes cleanly merged
as in the previous example, as well as the changes in the
conflicted files. Edit and resolve the conflict and mark it
resolved with git add as usual:</p>

<p>$ edit frotz $ git add frotz</p>
