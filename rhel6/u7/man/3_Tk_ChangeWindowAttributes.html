<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tk.h&gt;</p>

<p>Tk_ConfigureWindow(tkwin, valueMask, valuePtr)</p>

<p>Tk_MoveWindow(tkwin, x, y)</p>

<p>Tk_ResizeWindow(tkwin, width, height)</p>

<p>Tk_MoveResizeWindow(tkwin, x, y, width, height)</p>

<p>Tk_SetWindowBorderWidth(tkwin, borderWidth)</p>

<p>Tk_ChangeWindowAttributes(tkwin, valueMask, attsPtr)</p>

<p>Tk_SetWindowBackground(tkwin, pixel)</p>

<p>Tk_SetWindowBackgroundPixmap(tkwin, pixmap)</p>

<p>Tk_SetWindowBorder(tkwin, pixel)</p>

<p>Tk_SetWindowBorderPixmap(tkwin, pixmap)</p>

<p>Tk_SetWindowColormap(tkwin, colormap)</p>

<p>Tk_DefineCursor(tkwin, cursor)</p>

<p>Tk_UndefineCursor(tkwin)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS Tk_Window tkwin (in) Token for window.</p>

<p>unsigned int valueMask (in) OR-ed mask of values like
CWX or CWBorder- Pixel, indicating which fields of *valuePtr
or *attsPtr to use.</p>

<p>XWindowChanges *valuePtr (in) Points to a structure
containing new values for the configuration parameters
selected by valueMask. Fields not selected by valueMask are
ignored.</p>

<p>int x (in) New x-coordinate for tkwins top left pixel
(including border, if any) within tkwins par- ent.</p>

<p>int y (in) New y-coordinate for tkwins top left pixel
(including border, if any) within tkwins par- ent.</p>

<p>int width (in) New width for tkwin (interior, not
including border).</p>

<p>int height (in) New height for tkwin (interior, not
including border).</p>

<p>int borderWidth (in) New width for tkwins border.</p>

<p>XSetWindowAttributes *attsPtr (in) Points to a structure
containing new values for the attributes given by the
valueMask argu- ment. Attributes not selected by valueMask
are ignored.</p>

<p>unsigned long pixel (in) New background or border color
for window.</p>

<p>Pixmap pixmap (in) New pixmap to use for background or
border of tkwin. WARNING: cannot necessarily be deleted
immediately, as for Xlib calls. See note below.</p>

<p>Colormap colormap (in) New colormap to use for
tkwin.</p>

<p>Tk_Cursor cursor (in) New cursor to use for tkwin. If
None is spec- ified, then tkwin will not have its own
cursor; it will use the cursor of its parent.

<p>DESCRIPTION These procedures are analogous to the X
library procedures with similar names, such as
XConfigureWindow. Each one of the above procedures calls the
corresponding X procedure and also saves the configuration
information in Tks local structure for the window. This
allows the information to be retrieved quickly by the
application (using macros such as Tk_X and Tk_Height)
without having to contact the X server. In addition, if no X
window has actually been created for tkwin yet, these
procedures do not issue X operations or cause event handlers
to be invoked; they save the information in Tk s local
structure for the window; when the window is created later,
the saved information will be used to configure the
window.</p>

<p>See the X library documentation for details on what
these procedures do and how they use their arguments.</p>

<p>In the procedures Tk_ConfigureWindow, Tk_MoveWindow,
Tk_ResizeWindow, Tk_MoveResizeWindow, and
Tk_SetWindowBorderWidth, if tkwin is an inter- nal window
then event handlers interested in configure events are
invoked immediately, before the procedure returns. If tkwin
is a top- level window then the event handlers will be
invoked later, after X has seen the request and returned an
event for it.</p>

<p>Applications using Tk should never call procedures like
XConfigureWin- dow directly; they should always use the
corresponding Tk procedures.</p>

<p>The size and location of a window should only be
modified by the appro- priate geometry manager for that
window and never by a window itself (but see
Tk_MoveToplevelWindow for moving a top-level window).</p>

<p>You may not use Tk_ConfigureWindow to change the
stacking order of a window (valueMask may not contain the
CWSibling or CWStackMode bits). To change the stacking
order, use the procedure Tk_RestackWindow.</p>

<p>The procedure Tk_SetWindowColormap will automatically
add tkwin to the TK_COLORMAP_WINDOWS property of its nearest
top-level ancestor if the new colormap is different from
that of tkwins parent and tkwin is not already in the
TK_COLORMAP_WINDOWS property.</p>

<p>BUGS Tk_SetWindowBackgroundPixmap and
Tk_SetWindowBorderPixmap differ slightly from their Xlib
counterparts in that the pixmap argument may not necessarily
be deleted immediately after calling one of these pro-
cedures. This is because tkwins window may not exist yet at
the time of the call, in which case pixmap is merely saved
and used later when tkwins window is actually created. If
you wish to delete pixmap, then call Tk_MakeWindowExist
first to be sure that tkwins window exists and pixmap has
been passed to the X server.</p>

<p>A similar problem occurs for the cursor argument passed
to Tk_DefineCursor. The solution is the same as for pixmaps
above: call Tk_MakeWindowExist before freeing the
cursor.</p>
