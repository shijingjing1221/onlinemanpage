<p>LOOK(1) BSD General Commands Manual LOOK(1)</p>

<p>NAME look - display lines beginning with a given
string</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS look [-dfa] [-t termchar] string [file]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The look utility displays any lines in file
which contain string as a prefix. As look performs a binary
search, the lines in file must be sorted (where sort(1) got
the same options -d and/or -f that look is invoked
with).</p>

<p>If file is not specified, the file /usr/share/dict/words
is used, only alphanumeric characters are compared and the
case of alphabetic charac- ters is ignored.</p>

<p>Options:</p>

<p>-d Dictionary character set and order, i.e. only
alphanumeric char- acters are compared. (On by default if no
file specified).</p>

<p>-f Ignore the case of alphabetic characters. (On by
default if no file specified).</p>

<p>-a Use the alternate dictionary /usr/share/dict/web2</p>

<p>-t Specify a string termination character, i.e. only the
characters in string up to and including the first
occurrence of termchar are compared.</p>

<p>The look utility exits 0 if one or more lines were found
and displayed, 1 if no lines were found, and &gt;1 if an
error occurred.</p>

<p>FILES /usr/share/dict/words the dictionary
/usr/share/dict/web2 the alternate dictionary</p>

<p>SEE ALSO grep(1), sort(1)</p>

<p>COMPATIBILITY The original manual page stated that tabs
and blank characters partici- pated in comparisons when the
-d option was specified. This was incor- rect and the
current man page matches the historic implementation.</p>

<p>HISTORY Look appeared in Version 7 AT&amp;T Unix.</p>

<p>AVAILABILITY The look command is part of the
util-linux-ng package and is available from
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux-ng/.</p>
