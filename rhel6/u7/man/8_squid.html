<p>NAME squid - proxy caching server</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS squid [ -dhisrvzCFNRSVYX ] [ -l facility ] [ -f
config-file ] [ -[ au ] port ] [ -k signal ] [ -n
service-name ] [ -O cmd-line ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION squid is a high-performance proxy caching
server for web clients, sup- porting FTP, gopher, ICAP, ICP,
HTCP and HTTP data objects. Unlike traditional caching
software, squid handles all requests in a single,
non-blocking process.</p>

<p>squid keeps meta data and especially hot objects cached
in RAM, caches DNS lookups, supports non-blocking DNS
lookups, and implements negative caching of failed
requests.</p>

<p>squid supports SSL, extensive access controls, and full
request log- ging. By using the lightweight Internet Cache
Protocols ICP, HTCP or CARP, squid caches can be arranged in
a hierarchy or mesh for addi- tional bandwidth savings.</p>

<p>squid consists of a main server program squid, some
optional programs for custom processing and authentication,
and some management and client tools. When squid starts up,
it spawns a configurable number of helper processes, each of
which can perform parallel lookups. This reduces the amount
of time the cache waits for results.</p>

<p>squid is derived from the ARPA-funded Harvest Project
http://har- vest.cs.colorado.edu/</p>

<p>This manual page only lists the command line arguments.
For details on how to configure squid see the file
/etc/squid/squid.conf.documented, the Squid wiki FAQ and
examples at http://wiki.squid-cache.org/ , or the
configuration manual on the squid home page
http://www.squid- cache.org/Doc/config/</p>

<p>OPTIONS -a port Specify HTTP port number where Squid
should listen for requests, in addition to any http_port
specifications in squid.conf.</p>

<p>-d level Write debugging to stderr also.</p>

<p>-f file Use the given config-file instead of
/etc/squid/squid.conf. If the file name starts with a ! or |
then it is assumed to be an external command or command
line. Can for example be used to pre-process the
configuration before it is being read by Squid. To
facilitate this Squid also understands the common #line
notion to indicate the real source file.</p>

<p>-h Print help message.</p>

<p>-i Install as a Windows Service (see -n option).</p>

<p>-k reconfigure | rotate | shutdown | interrupt | kill |
debug | check | parse Parse configuration file, then send
signal to running copy (except -k parse) and exit.</p>

<p>-n name Specify Windows Service name to use for service
operations, default is: Squid</p>

<p>-r Remove a Windows Service (see -n option).</p>

<p>-s Enable logging to syslog. Also configurable in
/etc/squid/squid.conf</p>

<p>-l facility Use specified syslog facility. implies
-s</p>

<p>-u port Specify ICP port number (default: 3130), disable
with 0.</p>

<p>-v Print version and build details.</p>

<p>-z Create swap directories</p>

<p>-C Do not catch fatal signals.</p>

<p>-F Dont serve any requests until store is rebuilt.</p>

<p>-N No daemon mode.</p>

<p>-O options Set Windows Service Command line options in
Registry.</p>

<p>-R Do not set REUSEADDR on port.</p>

<p>-S Double-check swap during rebuild.</p>

<p>-X Force full debugging.</p>

<p>-Y Only return UDP_HIT or UDP_MISS_NOFETCH during fast
reload.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/squid/squid.conf The main configuration file.
You must initially make changes to this file for squid to
work. For example, the default configu- ration does not
allow access from any browser.</p>

<p>*.default files Reference copy of the configuration
file. Always kept up to date with the version of Squid you
are using. Use this to look up the default configuration
settings and syntax after upgrading.</p>

<p>/etc/squid/squid.conf.documented Reference copy of the
configuration file. Always kept up to date with the version
of Squid you are using. Use this to read the documentation
for configuration options available in your build of Squid.
The online configuration manual is also available for a full
reference of options. seehttp://www.squid-
cache.org/Doc/config/</p>

<p>cachemgr.conf The main configuration file for the web
cachemgr.cgi tools.</p>

<p>msntauth.conf The main configuration file for the Sample
MSNT authenticator.</p>

<p>errorpage.css CSS Stylesheet to control the display of
generated error pages. Use this to set any company branding
you need, it will apply to every Language Squid provides
error pages for.</p>

<p>/etc/squid/mime.conf (mime_table) MIME type mappings for
FTP gatewaying</p>

<p>/usr/share/squid/errors Location of squid error pages
and templates.</p>
