<p>openipmish(1) Shell interface to an IPMI system
openipmish(1)</p>

<p>NAME openipmish - Shell interface to an IPMI system</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS openipmish [option]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The openipmish is a command interpreter that
gives the full power of the OpenIPMI library to a user-level
command language. It is designed so it can easily be driven
with a scripting language like TCL, it has well-formed
output.</p>

<p>openipmish starts up with no connections or anything of
that nature. You must enter commands to make connections to
domains.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --dmsg Turn on message debugging, this will dump
all messages to debug log output.</p>

<p>--drawmsg Turn on raw message debugging, this will dump
all low-level mes- sages to debug log output. This differes
from normal message debugging in that all protocol messages
are also dumped, not just IPMI messages.</p>

<p>--dmem Turn on memory debugging, this will cause memory
allocation and deallocations to be checked. When the program
terminates, it will dump all memory that was not properly
freed (leaked).</p>

<p>--dlock Turn on lock debugging, this will check lock
operations to make sure that locks are help in all the
proper places and make sure that locks are properly
nested.</p>

<p>--snmp Enable the SNMP trap handler. openipmish must be
compiled with SNMP code enabled for this option to be
available.</p>

<p>--help Help output</p>

<p>COMMANDS openipmish follows the standard command syntax
defined in ipmi_cmd- lang(7). See that for the details on
most commands. The IPMI manual that comes with OpenIPMI will
also be quite handy.</p>

<p>openipmish defines some commands that are not in the
standard command language. These are:</p>

<p>read Read and execute commands from the given file.</p>

<p>exit Quit</p>

<p>redisp_cmd on|off Normally, openipmish redisplays the
command line when an event comes in. This is nice for
interactive use, but bad for script- ing. This lets you turn
that function on and off.</p>

<p>KNOWN PROBLEMS None</p>
