<p>UL(1) BSD General Commands Manual UL(1)</p>

<p>NAME ul - do underlining</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ul [-i] [-t terminal] [name ...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Ul reads the named files (or standard input
if none are given) and trans- lates occurrences of
underscores to the sequence which indicates under- lining
for the terminal in use, as specified by the environment
variable TERM. The terminfo database is read to determine
the appropriate sequences for underlining. If the terminal
is incapable of underlining, but is capable of a standout
mode then that is used instead. If the ter- minal can
overstrike, or handles underlining automatically, ul
degener- ates to cat(1). If the terminal cannot underline,
underlining is ignored.</p>

<p>The following options are available:</p>

<p>-i Underlining is indicated by a separate line
containing appropri- ate dashes -; this is useful when you
want to look at the underlining which is present in an nroff
output stream on a crt- terminal.</p>

<p>-t terminal Overrides the terminal type specified in the
environment with terminal.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT The following environment variable is
used:</p>

<p>TERM The TERM variable is used to relate a tty device
with its device capability description (see terminfo(5)).
TERM is set at login time, either by the default terminal
type specified in /etc/ttys or as set during the login
process by the user in their login file (see setenv(1)).</p>

<p>SEE ALSO man(1), nroff(1), colcrt(1)</p>

<p>BUGS Nroff usually outputs a series of backspaces and
underlines intermixed with the text to indicate underlining.
No attempt is made to optimize the backward motion.</p>

<p>HISTORY The ul command appeared in 3.0BSD.</p>

<p>AVAILABILITY The ul command is part of the util-linux-ng
package and is available from
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux-ng/.</p>
