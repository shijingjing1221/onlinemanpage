<p>ZSHROADMAP(1) ZSHROADMAP(1)</p>

<p>NAME zshroadmap - informal introduction to the zsh
manual</p>

<p>The Zsh Manual, like the shell itself, is large and
often complicated. This section of the manual provides some
pointers to areas of the shell that are likely to be of
particular interest to new users, and indi- cates where in
the rest of the manual the documentation is to be found.</p>

<p>WHEN THE SHELL STARTS When it starts, the shell reads
commands from various files. These can be created or edited
to customize the shell. See the section Startup/Shutdown
Files in zsh(1).</p>

<p>If no personal initialization files exist for the
current user, a func- tion is run to help you change some of
the most common settings. It won t appear if your
administrator has disabled the zsh/newuser module. The
function is designed to be self-explanatory. You can run it
by hand with autoload -Uz zsh-newuser-install;
zsh-newuser-install -f. See also the section User
Configuration Functions in zshcontrib(1).</p>

<p>INTERACTIVE USE Interaction with the shell uses the
builtin Zsh Line Editor, ZLE. This is described in detail in
zshzle(1).</p>

<p>The first decision a user must make is whether to use
the Emacs or Vi editing mode as the keys for editing are
substantially different. Emacs editing mode is probably more
natural for beginners and can be selected explicitly with
the command bindkey -e.</p>

<p>A history mechanism for retrieving previously typed
lines (most simply with the Up or Down arrow keys) is
available; note that, unlike other shells, zsh will not save
these lines when the shell exits unless you set appropriate
variables, and the number of history lines retained by
default is quite small (30 lines). See the description of
the shell variables (referred to in the documentation as
parameters) HISTFILE, HISTSIZE and SAVEHIST in
zshparam(1).</p>

<p>The shell now supports the UTF-8 character set (and also
others if sup- ported by the operating system). This is
(mostly) handled transpar- ently by the shell, but the
degree of support in terminal emulators is variable. There
is some discussion of this in the shell FAQ,
http://zsh.dotsrc.org/FAQ/ . Note in particular that for
combining characters to be handled the option
COMBINING_CHARS needs to be set. Because the shell is now
more sensitive to the definition of the char- acter set,
note that if you are upgrading from an older version of the
shell you should ensure that the appropriate variable,
either LANG (to affect all aspects of the shell s operation)
or LC_CTYPE (to affect only the handling of character sets)
is set to an appropriate value. This is true even if you are
using a single-byte character set includ- ing extensions of
ASCII such as ISO-8859-1 or ISO-8859-15. See the description
of LC_CTYPE in zshparam(1).</p>

<p>Completion Completion is a feature present in many
shells. It allows the user to type only a part (usually the
prefix) of a word and have the shell fill in the rest. The
completion system in zsh is programmable. For exam- ple, the
shell can be set to complete email addresses in arguments to
the mail command from your ~/.abook/addressbook; usernames,
hostnames, and even remote paths in arguments to scp, and so
on. Anything that can be written in or glued together with
zsh can be the source of what the line editor offers as
possible completions.</p>

<p>Zsh has two completion systems, an old, so called
compctl completion (named after the builtin command that
serves as its complete and only user interface), and a new
one, referred to as compsys, organized as library of builtin
and user-defined functions. The two systems differ in their
interface for specifying the completion behavior. The new
system is more customizable and is supplied with completions
for many commonly used commands; it is therefore to be
preferred.</p>

<p>The completion system must be enabled explicitly when
the shell starts. For more information see
zshcompsys(1).</p>

<p>Extending the line editor Apart from completion, the
line editor is highly extensible by means of shell
functions. Some useful functions are provided with the
shell; they provide facilities such as:</p>

<p>insert-composed-char composing characters not found on
the keyboard</p>

<p>match-words-by-style configuring what the line editor
considers a word when moving or deleting by word</p>

<p>history-beginning-search-backward-end, etc. alternative
ways of searching the shell history</p>

<p>replace-string, replace-pattern functions for replacing
strings or patterns globally in the com- mand line</p>

<p>edit-command-line edit the command line with an external
editor.</p>

<p>See the section ZLE Functions in zshcontrib(1) for
descriptions of these.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The shell has a large number of options for
changing its behaviour. These cover all aspects of the
shell; browsing the full documentation is the only good way
to become acquainted with the many possibilities. See
zshoptions(1).</p>

<p>PATTERN MATCHING The shell has a rich set of patterns
which are available for file matching (described in the
documentation as filename generation and also known for
historical reasons as globbing) and for use when pro-
gramming. These are described in the section Filename
Generation in zshexpn(1).</p>

<p>Of particular interest are the following patterns that
are not commonly supported by other systems of pattern
matching:</p>

<p>** for matching over multiple directories</p>

<p>~, ^ the ability to exclude patterns from matching when
the EXTENDED_GLOB option is set</p>

<p>(...) glob qualifiers, included in parentheses at the
end of the pat- tern, which select files by type (such as
directories) or attribute (such as size).</p>

<p>GENERAL COMMENTS ON SYNTAX Although the syntax of zsh is
in ways similar to the Korn shell, and therefore more
remotely to the original UNIX shell, the Bourne shell, its
default behaviour does not entirely correspond to those
shells. General shell syntax is introduced in the section
Shell Grammar in zshmisc(1).</p>

<p>One commonly encountered difference is that variables
substituted onto the command line are not split into words.
See the description of the shell option SH_WORD_SPLIT in the
section Parameter Expansion in zsh- expn(1). In zsh, you can
either explicitly request the splitting (e.g. ${=foo}) or
use an array when you want a variable to expand to more than
one word. See the section Array Parameters in
zshparam(1).</p>

<p>PROGRAMMING The most convenient way of adding
enhancements to the shell is typi- cally by writing a shell
function and arranging for it to be autoloaded. Functions
are described in the section Functions in zsh- misc(1).
Users changing from the C shell and its relatives should
notice that aliases are less used in zsh as they dont
perform argument substitution, only simple text
replacement.</p>

<p>A few general functions, other than those for the line
editor described above, are provided with the shell and are
described in zshcontrib(1). Features include:</p>

<p>promptinit a prompt theme system for changing prompts
easily, see the sec- tion Prompt Themes</p>

<p>zsh-mime-setup a MIME-handling system which dispatches
commands according to the suffix of a file as done by
graphical file managers</p>

<p>zcalc a calculator</p>

<p>zargs a version of xargs that makes the find command
redundant</p>

<p>zmv a command for renaming files by means of shell
patterns.</p>
