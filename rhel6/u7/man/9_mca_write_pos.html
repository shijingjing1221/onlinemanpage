<p>MCA_WRITE_POS(9) Public Functions Provided
MCA_WRITE_POS(9)</p>

<p>NAME mca_write_pos - read POS register from card</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS void mca_write_pos(int slot, int reg, unsigned
char byte);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS slot slot number to read from</p>

<p>reg register to read from</p>

<p>byte byte to write to the POS registers</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Store a POS value directly from the
hardware. You should not normally need to use this function
and should have a very good knowledge of MCA bus before you
do so. Doing this wrongly can damage the hardware.</p>

<p>This function may not be used from interrupt
context.</p>

<p>Note that this a technically a Bad Thing, as IBM tech
stuff says you should only set POS values through their
utilities. However, some devices such as the 3c523 recommend
that you write back some data to make sure the configuration
is consistent. I&acute;d say that IBM is right, but I like
my drivers to work.</p>

<p>This function can&acute;t do checks to see if multiple
devices end up with the same resources, so you might see
magic smoke if someone screws up.</p>
