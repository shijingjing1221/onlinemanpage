<p>WCSRCHR(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual WCSRCHR(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME wcsrchr - wide-character string scanning
operation</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;wchar.h&gt;</p>

<p>wchar_t *wcsrchr(const wchar_t *ws, wchar_t wc);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The wcsrchr() function shall locate the last
occurrence of wc in the wide-character string pointed to by
ws. The application shall ensure that the value of wc is a
character representable as a type wchar_t and a
wide-character code corresponding to a valid character in
the current locale. The terminating null wide-character code
shall be considered to be part of the wide-character
string.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, wcsrchr() shall
return a pointer to the wide-character code or a null
pointer if wc does not occur in the wide- character
string.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>
