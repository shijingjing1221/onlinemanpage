<p>NAME kinit - obtain and cache Kerberos ticket-granting
ticket</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS kinit [-V] [-l lifetime] [-s start_time] [-r
renewable_life] [-p | -P] [-f | -F] [-a] [-A] [-C] [-E] [-v]
[-R] [-k [-t keytab_file]] [-c cache_name] [-n] [-S
service_name][-T armor_ccache] [-X attribute[=value]]
[principal]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION kinit obtains and caches an initial
ticket-granting ticket for princi- pal.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -V display verbose output.</p>

<p>-l lifetime requests a ticket with the lifetime
lifetime. The value for lifetime must be followed
immediately by one of the following delimiters:</p>

<p>s seconds m minutes h hours d days</p>

<p>as in &quot;kinit -l 90m&quot;. You cannot mix units; a
value of 3h30m will result in an error.</p>

<p>If the -l option is not specified, the default ticket
lifetime (configured by each site) is used. Specifying a
ticket lifetime longer than the maximum ticket lifetime
(configured by each site) results in a ticket with the
maximum lifetime.</p>

<p>-s start_time requests a postdated ticket, valid
starting at start_time. Postdated tickets are issued with
the invalid flag set, and need to be fed back to the kdc
before use.</p>

<p>-r renewable_life requests renewable tickets, with a
total lifetime of renew- able_life. The duration is in the
same format as the -l option, with the same delimiters.</p>

<p>-f request forwardable tickets.</p>

<p>-F do not request forwardable tickets.</p>

<p>-p request proxiable tickets.</p>

<p>-P do not request proxiable tickets.</p>

<p>-a request tickets with the local address[es].</p>

<p>-A request address-less tickets.</p>

<p>-C requests canonicalization of the principal name.</p>

<p>-E treats the principal name as an enterprise name.</p>

<p>-v requests that the ticket granting ticket in the cache
(with the invalid flag set) be passed to the kdc for
validation. If the ticket is within its requested time
range, the cache is replaced with the validated ticket.</p>

<p>-R requests renewal of the ticket-granting ticket. Note
that an expired ticket cannot be renewed, even if the ticket
is still within its renewable life.</p>

<p>-k [-t keytab_file] requests a ticket, obtained from a
key in the local hosts keytab file. The name and location of
the keytab file may be specified with the -t keytab_file
option; otherwise the default name and location will be
used. By default a host ticket is requested but any
principal may be specified. On a KDC, the spe- cial keytab
location KDB: can be used to indicate that kinit should open
the KDC database and look up the key directly. This permits
an administrator to obtain tickets as any principal that
supports password-based authentication.</p>

<p>-n Requests anonymous processing. Two types of anonymous
princi- pals are supported. For fully anonymous Kerberos,
configure pkinit on the KDC and configure pkinit_anchors in
the clients krb5.conf. Then use the -n option with a
principal of the form @REALM (an empty principal name
followed by the at-sign and a realm name). If permitted by
the KDC, an anonymous ticket will be returned. A second form
of anonymous tickets is supported; these realm-exposed
tickets hide the identity of the client but not the clients
realm. For this mode, use kinit -n with a nor- mal principal
name. If supported by the KDC, the principal (but not realm)
will be replaced by the anonymous principal. As of release
1.8, the MIT Kerberos KDC only supports fully anonymous
operation.</p>

<p>-T armor_ccache Specifies the name of a credential cache
that already contains a ticket. If supported by the KDC,
This ccache will be used to armor the request so that an
attacker would have to know both the key of the armor ticket
and the key of the principal used for authentication in
order to attack the request. Armoring also makes sure that
the response from the KDC is not modified in transit.</p>

<p>-c cache_name use cache_name as the Kerberos 5
credentials (ticket) cache name and location; if this option
is not used, the default cache name and location are
used.</p>

<p>The default credentials cache may vary between systems.
If the KRB5CCNAME environment variable is set, its value is
used to name the default ticket cache. If a principal name
is specified and the type of the default credentials cache
supports a collec- tion (such as the DIR type), an existing
cache containing cre- dentials for the principal is selected
or a new one is created and becomes the new primary cache.
Otherwise, any existing con- tents of the default cache are
destroyed by kinit.</p>

<p>-S service_name specify an alternate service name to use
when getting initial tickets.</p>

<p>-X attribute[=value] specify a pre-authentication
attribute and value to be passed to pre-authentication
plugins. The acceptable attribute and value values vary from
pre-authentication plugin to plugin. This option may be
specified multiple times to specify multiple attributes. If
no value is specified, it is assumed to be
&quot;yes&quot;.</p>

<p>The following attributes are recognized by the OpenSSL
pkinit pre-authentication mechanism:
X509_user_identity=value specify where to find users X509
identity information X509_anchors=value specify where to
find trusted X509 anchor information flag_RSA_PROTOCOL[=yes]
specify use of RSA, rather than the default Diffie-Hellman
protocol</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT Kinit uses the following environment
variables:</p>

<p>KRB5CCNAME Location of the default Kerberos 5
credentials (ticket) cache, in the form type:residual. If no
type prefix is present, the FILE type is assumed. The type
of the default cache may determine the availability of a
cache collection; for instance, a default cache of type DIR
causes caches within the directory to be present in the
collection.</p>

<p>FILES /tmp/krb5cc_[uid] default location of Kerberos 5
credentials cache ([uid] is the decimal UID of the
user).</p>

<p>/etc/krb5.keytab default location for the local host s
keytab file.</p>
