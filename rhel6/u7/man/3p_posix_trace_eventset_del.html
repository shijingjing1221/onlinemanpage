<p>POSIX_TRACE_EVENTSET_ADD(3PPOSIX Programmer s
ManuPOSIX_TRACE_EVENTSET_ADD(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME posix_trace_eventset_add, posix_trace_eventset_del,
posix_trace_eventset_empty, posix_trace_eventset_fill,
posix_trace_eventset_ismember - manipulate trace event type
sets (TRAC- ING)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;trace.h&gt;</p>

<p>int posix_trace_eventset_add(trace_event_id_t event_id,
trace_event_set_t *set); int
posix_trace_eventset_del(trace_event_id_t event_id,
trace_event_set_t *set); int
posix_trace_eventset_empty(trace_event_set_t *set); int
posix_trace_eventset_fill(trace_event_set_t *set, int what);
int posix_trace_eventset_ismember(trace_event_id_t event_id,
const trace_event_set_t *restrict set, int *restrict
ismember);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION These primitives manipulate sets of trace
event types. They operate on data objects addressable by the
application, not on the current trace event filter of any
trace stream.</p>

<p>The posix_trace_eventset_add() and
posix_trace_eventset_del() func- tions, respectively, shall
add or delete the individual trace event type specified by
the value of the argument event_id to or from the trace
event type set pointed to by the argument set. Adding a
trace event type already in the set or deleting a trace
event type not in the set shall not be considered an
error.</p>

<p>The posix_trace_eventset_empty() function shall
initialize the trace event type set pointed to by the set
argument such that all trace event types defined, both
system and user, shall be excluded from the set.</p>

<p>The posix_trace_eventset_fill() function shall
initialize the trace event type set pointed to by the
argument set, such that the set of trace event types defined
by the argument what shall be included in the set. The value
of the argument what shall consist of one of the follow- ing
values, as defined in the &lt;trace.h&gt; header:</p>

<p>POSIX_TRACE_WOPID_EVENTS</p>

<p>All the process-independent implementation-defined
system trace event types are included in the set.</p>

<p>POSIX_TRACE_SYSTEM_EVENTS</p>

<p>All the implementation-defined system trace event types
are included in the set, as are those defined in IEEE Std
1003.1-2001.</p>

<p>POSIX_TRACE_ALL_EVENTS</p>

<p>All trace event types defined, both system and user, are
included in the set.</p>

<p>Applications shall call either
posix_trace_eventset_empty() or posix_trace_eventset_fill()
at least once for each object of type trace_event_set_t
prior to any other use of that object. If such an object is
not initialized in this way, but is nonetheless supplied as
an argument to any of the posix_trace_eventset_add(),
posix_trace_eventset_del(), or
posix_trace_eventset_ismember() func- tions, the results are
undefined.</p>

<p>The posix_trace_eventset_ismember() function shall test
whether the trace event type specified by the value of the
argument event_id is a member of the set pointed to by the
argument set. The value returned in the object pointed to by
ismember argument is zero if the trace event type identifier
is not a member of the set and a value different from zero
if it is a member of the set.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, these functions
shall return a value of zero. Otherwise, they shall return
the corresponding error number.</p>

<p>ERRORS These functions may fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The value of one of the arguments is invalid.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
