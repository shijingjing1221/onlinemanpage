<p>SG_SAT_PHY_EVENT(8) SG3_UTILS SG_SAT_PHY_EVENT(8)</p>

<p>NAME sg_sat_phy_event - Sends an ATA READ LOG EXT
command via a SAT pass through to fetch log page 11h which
contains SATA phy event counters</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sg_sat_phy_event [--ck_cond] [--extend]
[--help] [--hex] [--ignore] [--len=16|12] [--raw] [--reset]
--verbose] [--version] DEVICE</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This utility sends an ATA READ LOG EXT with
the log page (&quot;address&quot;) set to 11h to DEVICE and
outputs the response. Log page 11h is defined in the SATA
2.5 standard and contains phy event counters. Rather than
send this command directly to the DEVICE, are sent via a
SCSI transport which is assumed to contain a SCSI to ATA
Translation (SAT) Layer (SATL). The SAT standard (SAT ANSI
INCITS 431-2007, prior draft: sat-r09.pdf at www.t10.org)
defines two SCSI &quot;ATA PASS-THROUGH&quot; com- mands:
one using a 16 byte &quot;cdb&quot; and the other with a 12
byte cdb. This utility defaults to using the 16 byte cdb
variant.</p>

<p>The SATL may be in an operating system driver, in host
bus adapter firmware or in some external enclosure.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Arguments to long options are mandatory for
short options as well.</p>

<p>-c, --ck_cond sets the CK_COND bit in the ATA
PASS-THROUGH SCSI cdb. The default setting is clear (i.e.
0). When set the SATL should yield a sense buffer containing
a ATA Result descriptor irre- spective of whether the
command succeeded or failed. When clear the SATL should only
yield a sense buffer containing a ATA Result descriptor if
the command failed.</p>

<p>-e, --extend sets the EXTEND bit in the ATA PASS-THROUGH
SCSI cdb. The default setting is clear (i.e. 0). When set a
48 bit LBA command is sent to the device. This option has no
effect when --len=12.</p>

<p>-h, --help outputs the usage message summarizing command
line options then exits. Ignores DEVICE if given.</p>

<p>-H, --hex outputs the ATA READ LOG EXT response in hex.
The default action (i.e. without any -H options) is to
output the response in hex, grouped in 16 bit words (i.e.
the ATA standards prefer- ence). When given once, the
response is output in ASCII hex bytes (i.e. the SCSI
standards preference). When given twice (i.e. -HH) the
output is in hex, grouped in 16 bit words, the same as the
default but without a header.</p>

<p>-i, --ignore usually the phy counter identifier names
are decoded. When this option is given, the numeric value of
the identifier is output, the vendor flag, the data length
(in bytes) and the correspond- ing value.</p>

<p>-l, --len=16 | 12 this is the length of the SCSI cdb
used for the ATA PASS-THROUGH commands. The argument can
either be 16 or 12. The default is 16. The larger cdb size
is needed for 48 bit LBA addressing of ATA devices. On the
other hand some SCSI transports cannot convey SCSI commands
longer than 12 bytes.</p>

<p>-r, --raw output the ATA READ LOG EXT response in
binary. The output should be piped to a file or another
utility when this option is used. The binary is sent to
stdout, and errors are sent to stderr.</p>

<p>-R, --reset reset the counters after the current values
are returned, decoded and displayed.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose increases the level or verbosity.</p>

<p>-V, --version print out version string</p>

<p>NOTES The SCSI ATA PASS-THROUGH (12) commands opcode is
0xa1 and it clashes with the MMC sets BLANK command used by
cd/dvd writers. So a SATL in front of an ATAPI device that
uses MMC (i.e. has peripheral device type 5) probably should
treat opcode 0xa1 as a BLANK command and send it through to
the cd/dvd drive. The ATA PASS-THROUGH (16) commands opcode
(0x85) does not clash with anything so it is a better
choice.</p>

<p>In the 2.4 series of Linux kernels the DEVICE must be a
SCSI generic (sg) device. In the 2.6 series block devices
(e.g. disks and ATAPI DVDs) can also be specified. For
example &quot;sg_inq /dev/sda&quot; will work in the 2.6
series kernels. From lk 2.6.6 other SCSI &quot;char&quot;
device names may be used as well (e.g.
&quot;/dev/st0m&quot;).</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The exit status of sg_sat_identify is 0 when
it is successful. Other- wise see the sg3_utils(8) man
page.</p>
