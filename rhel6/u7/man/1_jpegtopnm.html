<p>NAME jpegtopnm - convert JPEG/JFIF file to PPM or PGM
image</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS jpegtopnm [-dct {int|fast|float}] [-nosmooth]
[-maxmemory N] [{-adobe|-notadobe}] [-comments] [-dumpexif]
[-exif=filespec] [-multi- ple] [-repair] [-verbose]
[-tracelevel N] [filename]</p>

<p>Minimum unique abbreviation of option is acceptable. You
may use dou- ble hyphens instead of single hyphen to denote
options. You may use white space in place of the equals sign
to separate an option name from its value.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>jpegtopnm converts JFIF images to PPM or PGM images.</p>

<p>By default, jpegtopnm expects the input stream to
contain one JFIF image and produces one PGM or PPM image as
output. It fails if the input stream is empty.</p>

<p>But with the -multiple option, jpegtopnm reads JFIF
images sequentially from the input stream and writes one PPM
or PGM image to the output stream for each JFIF input. If
the input stream is empty, so is the output.</p>

<p>The input stream is the filename you specify or, if you
dont specify filename, Standard Input. The output stream is
Standard Output.</p>

<p>If a JFIF input image is of the grayscale variety,
jpegtopnm generates a PGM image. Otherwise, it generates a
PPM image.</p>

<p>Before Netpbm 10.11 (October 2002), jpegtopnm did not
have the multiple image stream capability. From 10.11
through 10.22, Netpbm always behaved as if you specified
-multiple. Starting with Netpbm 10.23 (July 2004), Netpbms
default behavior went back to the pre-10.11 behavior and the
new -multiple option selected the 10.12 behavior. The reason
for the reversion was that there were discovered in the
world files that contain JFIF images followed by something
other than another JFIF image. The producers of these files
expect them to work with any JFIF interpreter because most
JFIF interpreters just stop reading the file after the first
JFIF image.</p>

<p>jpegtopnm uses the Independent JPEG Group s JPEG library
to interpret the input file. See http://www.ijg.org for
information on the library.</p>

<p>JFIF is the correct name for the image format commonly
known as JPEG. Strictly speaking, JPEG is a method of
compression. The image format using JPEG compression that is
by far the most common is JFIF. There is also a subformat of
TIFF that uses JPEG compression.</p>

<p>EXIF is an image format that is a subformat of JFIF (to
wit, a JFIF file that contains an EXIF header as an APP1
marker). jpegtopnm han- dles EXIF.</p>

<p>JFIF files can have either 8 bits per sample or 12 bits
per sample. The 8 bit variety is by far the most common.
There are two versions of the IJG JPEG library. One reads
only 8 bit files and the other reads only 12 bit files. You
must link the appropriate one of these libraries with
jpegtopnm. Ordinarily, this means the library is in your
shared library search path when you run jpegtopnm.</p>

<p>jpegtopnm generates output with either one byte or two
bytes per sample depending on whether the JFIF input has
either 8 bits or 12 bits per sample. You can use pamdepth to
reduce a two-byte-per-sample file to a one-byte-per-sample
file if you need to.</p>

<p>If the JFIF file uses the CMYK or YCCK color space, the
input does not actually contain enough information to know
what color each pixel is. To know what color a pixel is, one
would have to know the properties of the inks to which the
color space refers. jpegtopnm interprets the colors using
the common transformation which assumes all the inks are
simply subtractive and linear.</p>

<p>See the jpegtopnmmanual(1) for information on how images
lose quality when you convert to and from JFIF.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The options are only for advanced users:</p>

<p>-dct int Use integer DCT method (default).</p>

<p>-dct fast Use fast integer DCT (less accurate).</p>

<p>-dct float Use floating-point DCT method. The float
method is very slightly more accurate than the int method,
but is much slower unless your machine has very fast
floating-point hardware. Also note that results of the
floating-point method may vary slightly across machines,
while the integer methods should give the same results
everywhere. The fast integer method is much less accu- rate
than the other two.</p>

<p>-nosmooth Use a faster, lower-quality upsampling
routine.</p>

<p>-maxmemory N Set limit on the amount of memory jpegtopnm
uses in processing large images. Value is in thousands of
bytes, or millions of bytes if M is suffixed to the number.
For example, -maxmemory 4m selects 4000000 bytes. If
jpegtopnm needs more space, it uses temporary files.</p>

<p>-adobe</p>

<p>-notadobe There are two variations on the CMYK (and
likewise YCCK) color space that may be used in the JFIF
input. In the normal one, a zero value for a color
components indicates absence of ink. In the other, a zero
value means the maximum ink coverage. The latter is used by
Adobe Photoshop when it creates a bare JFIF output file (but
not when it creates JFIF output as part of Encapsulated
Postscript output).</p>

<p>These options tell jpegtopnm which version of the CMYK
or YCCK color space the image uses. If you specify neither,
jpegtopnm tries to figure it out on its own. In the present
version, it doesn t try very hard at all: It just assumes
the Photoshop ver- sion, since Photoshop and its emulators
seem to be the main source of CMYK and YCCK images. But with
experience of use, future versions might be more
sophisticated.</p>

<p>If the JFIF image does not indicate that it is CMYK or
YCCK, these options have no effect.</p>

<p>If you dont use the right one of these options, the
symptom is output that looks like a negative.</p>

<p>-dumpexif Print the interpreted contents of any Exif
header in the input file to the Standard Error file. Similar
to the program jhead (not part of the Netpbm package).</p>

<p>This option was added in Netpbm 9.19 (September
2001).</p>

<p>-exif=filespec Extract the contents of the EXIF header
from the input image and write it to the file filespec.
filespec=- means write it to Standard Output. When you write
the EXIF header to Standard Output, jpegtopnm does not
output the converted image (which is what normally would go
to Standard Output) at all.</p>

<p>jpegtopnm writes the contents of the EXIF header
byte-for-byte, starting with the two byte length field
(which length includes those two bytes).</p>

<p>You can use this file as input to pnmtojpeg to insert an
identi- cal EXIF header into a new JFIF image.</p>

<p>If there is no EXIF header, jpegtopnm writes two bytes
of binary zero and nothing else.</p>

<p>An EXIF header takes the form of a JFIF APP1 marker.
Only the first such marker within the JFIF header
counts.</p>

<p>This option was added in Netpbm 9.19 (September
2001).</p>

<p>-multiple Read multiple JFIF images sequentially from
the input stream. See Description section for details.</p>

<p>This option was new in Netpbm 10.23 (July 2004).</p>

<p>-repair If the JFIF input is invalid, try to salvage
whatever informa- tion is there and produce a valid PNM
image as output.</p>

<p>Without this option, some invalid input causes jpegtopnm
to fail, and what output it produces is undefined. With
-repair such invalid input causes jpegtopnm to succeed
instead.</p>

<p>But note that there are some forms of invalid input that
always cause jpegtopnm to fail and other than always cause
it to sal- vage image information and succeed.</p>

<p>One particular case where -repair makes a difference is
the com- mon case that the file is truncated somewhere after
the JFIF header. Without -repair, that always causes a
failure; with -repair it always causes success. Because the
image information is laid out generally top to bottom in the
JFIF stream, the image jpegtopnm produces in this case has
the proper image con- tents at the top, but the bottom is
padded with gray.</p>

<p>This option was new in Netpbm 10.38.0 (March 2007).
Before that, jpegtopnm always fails in the cases in
question.</p>

<p>-comments Print any comments in the input file to the
Standard Error file.</p>

<p>-verbose Print details about the conversion to the
Standard Error file.</p>

<p>-tracelevel n Turn on the JPEG librarys trace messages
to the Standard Error file. A higher value of n gets more
trace information. -ver- bose implies a trace level of at
least 1.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES This example converts the color JFIF file
foo.jpg to a PPM file named foo.ppm:</p>

<p>jpegtopnm foo.jpg &gt;foo.ppm</p>

<p>HINTS You can use pnmquant to color quantize the result,
i.e. to reduce the number of distinct colors in the image.
In fact, you may have to if you want to convert the PPM file
to certain other formats. ppmdither Does a more
sophisticated quantization.</p>

<p>Use pamscale to change the dimensions of the resulting
image.</p>

<p>Use ppmtopgm to convert a color JFIF file to a grayscale
PGM file.</p>

<p>You can easily use these converters together. E.g.:</p>

<p>jpegtopnm foo.jpg | ppmtopgm | pamscale .25
&gt;foo.pgm</p>

<p>-dct fast and/or -nosmooth gain speed at a small
sacrifice in quality.</p>

<p>If you are fortunate enough to have very fast floating
point hardware, -dct float may be even faster than -dct
fast. But on most machines -dct float is slower than -dct
int; in this case it is not worth using, because its
theoretical accuracy advantage is too small to be signifi-
cant in practice.</p>

<p>Another program, djpeg, is similar. djpeg is maintained
by the Inde- pendent JPEG Group and packaged with the JPEG
library which jpegtopnm uses for all its JPEG work. Because
of that, you may expect it to exploit more current JPEG
features. Also, since you have to have the library to run
jpegtopnm, but not vice versa, cjpeg may be more com- monly
available.</p>

<p>On the other hand, djpeg does not use the NetPBM
libraries to generate its output, as all the NetPBM tools
such as jpegtopnm do. This means it is less likely to be
consistent with all the other programs that deal with the
NetPBM formats. Also, the command syntax of jpegtopnm is
consistent with that of the other Netpbm tools, unlike
djpeg.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT JPEGMEM If this environment variable is set,
its value is the default memory limit. The value is
specified as described for the -maxmemory option. An
explicit -maxmemory option overrides any JPEGMEM.</p>
