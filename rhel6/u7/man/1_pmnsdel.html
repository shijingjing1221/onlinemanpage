<p>NAME pmnsdel - delete a subtree of names from the
Performance Co-Pilot PMNS</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS $PCP_BINADM_DIR/pmnsdel [-n namespace]
metricpath [ ... ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pmnsdel removes subtrees of names from a
Performance Metrics Name Space (PMNS), as used by the
components of the Performance Co-Pilot (PCP).</p>

<p>Normally pmnsdel operates on the default Performance
Metrics Name Space (PMNS), however if the -n option is
specified an alternative namespace is used from the file
namespace.</p>

<p>The default PMNS is found in the file
$PCP_VAR_DIR/pmns/root unless the environment variable
PMNS_DEFAULT is set, in which case the value is assumed to
be the pathname to the file containing the default PMNS.</p>

<p>The metric names to be deleted are all those for which
one of the met- ricpath arguments is a prefix in the PMNS,
see pmns(5).</p>

<p>All of the files defining the PMNS must be located
within the directory that contains the root of the PMNS, and
this would typically be $PCP_VAR_DIR/pmns for the default
PMNS, and this would typically imply running pmnsdel as
root.</p>

<p>Provided some initial integrity checks are satisfied,
pmnsdel will update the necessary PMNS files. Should an
error be encountered the original namespace is restored.
Note that any PMNS files that are no longer referenced by
the modified namespace will not be removed, even though
their contents are not part of the new namespace.</p>

<p>CAVEAT Once the writing of the new namespace file has
begun, the signals SIG- INT, SIGHUP and SIGTERM will be
ignored to protect the integrity of the new files.</p>

<p>FILES $PCP_VAR_DIR/pmns/root the default PMNS, when then
environment vari- able PMNS_DEFAULT is unset</p>

<p>PCP ENVIRONMENT Environment variables with the prefix
PCP_ are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP. On each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in pcp.conf(5).</p>
