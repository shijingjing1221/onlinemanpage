<p>NAME Xaw - X Athena Widgets</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Xaw is a widget set based on the X Toolkit
Intrinsics (Xt) Library. This release by the X.Org
Foundation includes additions and modifica- tions originally
made for The XFree86 Project, Inc. This manual page
describes these changes as well as some of the common
interfaces between its version and the previous X Consortium
release (Xaw6).</p>

<p>The bulk of the Xaw documentation is located in the API
specification which may be installed in
/usr/share/doc/libXaw-1.0.11-2.el6, or found on the X.Org
website.</p>

<p>ACTIONS All of the Xaw widgets now have the additional
translations call-proc, declare, get-values and set-values.
The syntax for these actions is:</p>

<p>action-name (boolean-expression, arguments)</p>

<p>Action-name is one of call-proc, declare, get-values or
set-values.</p>

<p>Boolean-expression is composed with the operators |
(or), &amp; (and), ^ (xor), and ~ (not). The operands can be
a variable name, which starts with a $; a resource name
without the bindings . or *; or a constant name, including
mine (event-&gt;xany.window == XtWindow(widget)), faked
(event-&gt;xany.send_event != 0), true (1) and false
(0).</p>

<p>Arguments are self-explanatory; when starting with a $
they name a variable, otherwise, they indicate a resource
name.</p>

<p>call-proc (boolean-expression, procedure-name) This
action allows the evaluation of a boolean expression in the
first parameter before calling a action procedure. The
procedure is only called if the expression evaluates as
true. Example:</p>

<p>call-proc(&quot;$inside &amp; $pressed&quot;,
notify)</p>

<p>declare (boolean-expression, variable, value, ...) This
action is used to create new variables or change their
values. Any number of variable-value tuples may be
specified. Example:</p>

<p>declare(1, $pressed, 1)</p>

<p>get-values (boolean-expression, variable, value, ...)
This action reads a widget resource value into a variable.
Any number of variable-value tuples may be specified.
Example:</p>

<p>get-values(1, $fg, foreground, $bg, background)</p>

<p>set-values (boolean-expression, variable, value, ...)
This action sets a widget resource to the given value, which
may be a variable. Any number of variable-value tuples may
be specified. Example:</p>

<p>set-values(1, foreground, $bg, background, $fg)</p>

<p>Here is a sample translation to make a label widget
behave like a but- ton:</p>

<p>&lt;Map&gt;: get-values(1, $fg, foreground, $bg,
background) &lt;Btn1Down&gt;: set-values(1, foreground,
yellow, background, gray30) &lt;Btn1Up&gt;: set-values(1,
foreground, $fg, background, $bg)</p>

<p>DISPLAY LISTS All of the Xaw widgets have now the
additional resource displayList. This resource allows
drawing the widget decorations using commands embedded in a
resource string. The displayList resource has the syn-
tax:</p>

<p>[class-name:]function-name arguments[[{;n}]...]</p>

<p>Class-name is any registered set of functions to draw in
the widget. Currently the only existing class is xlib, which
provides access to the Xlib drawing primitives.</p>

<p>Function-name is the drawing or configuration function
to be called, described bellow.</p>

<p>Arguments may be anything suitable to the displayList
function being called. When the function requires a
coordinate, the syntax is {+-}&lt;integer&gt; or
&lt;integer&gt;/&lt;integer&gt;. Examples: +0,+0 top, left
-0,-0 bottom, right -+10,-+10 bottom+10, right+10 +0,1/2
left, vertical-center</p>

<p>arc-mode mode Sets the arc mode. Accepted modes are
&quot;pieslice&quot; and &quot;chord&quot;, which set the
arc to ArcPieSlice or ArcChord, respectively. Example:</p>

<p>arc-mode chord</p>

<p>bg color-spec background color-spec Sets the background
color. color-spec must a valid color specification.
Example:</p>

<p>background red</p>

<p>cap-style style Sets the cap style. Accepted styles are
&quot;notlast&quot;, &quot;butt&quot;, &quot;round&quot;,
and &quot;projecting&quot;, which set the cap style to
CapNot- Last, CapBut, CapRound or CapProjecting,
respectively. Exam- ple:</p>

<p>cap-style round</p>

<p>clip-mask pixmap-spec Sets the pixmap for the clip mask.
Requires a pixmap parame- ter, as described in the PIXMAPS
section below. Example:</p>

<p>clip-mask xlogo11</p>

<p>clip-origin x,y Sets the clip x and y origin. Requires
two arguments, the x and y coordinates. Example:</p>

<p>clip-origin 10,10</p>

<p>clip-rects x1,y1,x2,y2 [...,xn,yn] clip-rectangles
x1,y1,x2,y2 [...,xn,yn] Sets a list of rectangles to the
clip mask. The number of arguments must be a multiple of
four. The arguments are coor- dinates. The parser calculates
the width and height of the rectangles. Example:</p>

<p>clip-rects 0,0,10,20, 20,10,30,30</p>

<p>coord-mode mode Changes the coord mode for fill-polygon,
draw-lines, and draw- points. Accepted parameters are
&quot;modeorigin&quot; and &quot;previous&quot;, that sets
the coord mode to CoordModeOrigin or CoordModePrevi- ous,
respectively. Example:</p>

<p>coord-mode previous</p>

<p>copy-area {pixmap-spec|.},dstx,dsty[,x2,y2,srcx,srcy]
Calls XCopyArea. The character . means copy the window con-
tents; pixmap-spec is as defined in the PIXMAPS section
below. X2 and y2 are the coordinates of the end copy, not
the width and height; if not defined, the parser calculates
them. src_x and src_y default to zero. Example:</p>

<p>copy-area Term,10,10</p>

<p>copy-plane
{pixmap-spec|.},dstx,dsty[,x2,y2,srcx,srcy,plane] Calls
XCopyPlane. The character . means copy the window con-
tents; pixmap-spec is as defined in the PIXMAPS section
below. X2 and y2 are the coordinates of the end copy, not
the width and height; if not defined, the parser calculates
them. src_x and src_y default to zero. Plane defaults to
one. Example:</p>

<p>copy-plane star,10,10</p>

<p>dashes i1[...,in] Sets the dashes for line drawing.
Accepts up to 127 arguments. Example:</p>

<p>dashes 3,7 9,10</p>

<p>draw-arc x1,y1,x2,y2[,start-angle,end-angle] Draws an
arc. The four first arguments are the rectangle enclosing
the arc. The two remaining arguments, if specified, are the
start and end angle, in degrees. Example:</p>

<p>draw-arc +0,+0,-1,-1,0,90</p>

<p>draw-rect x1,y1,x2,y2 draw-rectangle x1,y1,x2,y2 Draws a
rectangle. Requires four arguments, which are the start and
end coordinate pairs. Example:</p>

<p>draw-rect +1,+1,-5,-5</p>

<p>draw-string x,y,&quot;string&quot; Draws a text string.
Requires three arguments, a x coordinate, a y coordinate,
and a string. Strings that have white space can be quoted
with the &quot; character; the backslash character _ can
also be used, but it will be necessary escape it twice.
Example:</p>

<p>draw-string 10,10, &quot;Hello world!&quot;</p>

<p>exposures boolean Sets graphics exposures in the GC.
Allowed parameters are a integer or the strings
&quot;true&quot;, &quot;false&quot;, &quot;on&quot; and

<p>fill-arc x1,y1,x2,y2[,start-angle,end-angle] Like
draw-arc, but fills the contents of the arc with the cur-
rently selected foreground. Example:</p>

<p>fill-arc +0,+0,-1,-1,0,180</p>

<p>fill-poly x1,y1 [...,xn,yn] fill-polygon x1,y1
[...,xn,yn] Like draw-lines, but fills the enclosed polygon
and joins the first and last point, if they are not at the
same position. Example:</p>

implemented as a way to quickly compose com- plex
decorations in widgets. Pixmap-spec is as defined in the
PIXMAPS section below. xs and ys are the coordinates from
where to start copying the pixmap; xe and ye are optional
(they default to xs + pixmap.width and ys + pixmap.height,
respec- tively). If the pixmap has a mask, the copy is
masked accord- ingly. Example:</p>

to IncludeInferiors or ClipByChildren, respectively.
Example:</p>

<p>subwindow-mode includeinferiors</p>

<p>tile pixmap-spec Sets the pixmap for a tile. Requires a
pixmap parameter, as described in the PIXMAPS section below.
Example:</p>

<p>tile xlogo11?foreground=red&amp;background=gray80</p>

<p>ts-origin x,y Sets the tile stipple x and y origin.

foreground gray85; draw-lines -1,+0,+0,+0,+0,-1</p>

<p>PIXMAPS A String to Pixmap converter has been added to
Xaw. This converter is meant to be extended, and has enough
abstraction to allow loading sev- eral image formats. It
uses a format that resembles a URL, with the syntax:</p>

<p>[type:]name[?arg=val[{&amp;}...]]</p>

<p>Type can be one of bitmap, gradient or xpm.</p>

<p>Name may be a file name, or, in the case of type
gradient, may be either vertical or horizontal.</p>

<p>Arg=val is a list of arguments to the converter. An
argument list is preceded by a question mark, and multiple
arguments are separated by ampersands. The most common
arguments are foreground and background. Gradients also
support the arguments start and end (colors with which to
start and end the gradient); the steps argument, to allow
using less colors; and the dimension argument to specify the
size of the gradi- ent. The xpm converter understands the
closeness argument, which aids in using fewer colors (useful
if you have a limited colormap).</p>

<p>TEXT WIDGET Most of the changes to this version of the
Xaw library were done in the TextWidget, TextSrcObject,
TextSinkObject and related files.</p>

<p>A couple of highly visible changes in the Text widget
are due to many bugs in the Xaw6 implementation involving
scrollbars and auto-resizing. Scrollbars being added or
removed caused several problems in keeping the text cursor
visible, and in Xaw6 it was very easy to have a widget
thinking the cursor was visible, when it was not. Also,
permitting automatic resizing of the widget to a larger
geometry created other problems, making it difficult to have
a consistent layout in the appli- cation, and, if the window
manager did not interfere, windows larger than the screen
could result. Therefore, some functionality involving
scrollbars and auto-resizing has been disabled; see the
section on new and modified Text widget resources below.</p>

<p>The Text widgets default key bindings were originally
based on the Emacs text editor. In this release, even more
operations familiar to Emacs users have been added. New text
actions include:</p>

<p>indent Indents text blocks. Not bound by default. The
Text widget also does not attempt to perform
auto-indentation of its source object by default.</p>

<p>keyboard-reset Resets the keyboard state. Reverts the
action multiplier to 1, and if undo is enabled, toggles
between undo and redo. Bound by default to
Control&lt;Key&gt;G.</p>

<p>kill-ring-yank In this version of Xaw, text killed in
any text field is kept in memory, allowing cut and paste
operations internally to the program between text fields.
Bound by default to Meta&lt;Key&gt;Y.</p>

<p>numeric Listed here only for purposes of documentation.
Called by default when one of the characters 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8, 9, 0, or - is typed, allowing composition of the
multiplication number of text actions.</p>

<p>set-keyboard-focus Sets the input focus of the top level
widget to the text field. Not enabled by default, but bound
to the &lt;Btn1Down&gt; event.</p>

<p>toggle-overwrite Toggles overwrite mode. In overwrite
mode, any text inserted in a text field will replace
existing text. Bound by default to &lt;Key&gt;Insert.</p>

<p>undo Sets the enableUndo resource of the textSrcObject.
Not enabled by default, but bound to
Control&lt;Key&gt;_.</p>

<p>New and modified Text widget resources include:</p>

<p>justify (Class Justify) Sets the text justification. Can
be one of left, right, cen- ter, or full. Only enabled when
the autoFill resource is set, and the resources leftColumn
and rightColumn are correctly set.</p>

<p>leftColumn (Class Column) Specifies the left column at
which to break text. Text lines started with an alphanumeric
character will automatically start at this column.</p>

<p>positionCallback (Class Callback) Allows installation of
a callback to be called every time the cursor is moved,
and/or the file changes its size. The call- back is called
with a pointer to a structure containing the following data:
typedef struct { int line_number; int column_number;
XawTextPosition insert_position; XawTextPosition
last_position; Boolean overwrite_mode; }
XawTextPositionInfo; This callback is intended to help
programmers write text edi- tors based on the Xaw widget
set.</p>

<p>resize (Class Resize) No longer supported, but
recognized for backward compatibility with resource
specifications written for the Xaw6 Text widget.</p>

<p>rightColumn (Class Column) Specifies the right column at
which to break text. Text lines started with an alphanumeric
character will automatically end at this column.</p>

<p>scrollHorizontal (Class Scroll) scrollVertical (Class
Scroll) These resources control the placement of scrollbars
on the left and bottom edges of the Text widget. They accept
the values XawtextScrollAlways and XawtextScrollNever. A
converter is registered for this resource that will convert
the following strings: always and never. The value
XawtextScrollWhenNeeded (and whenNeeded, recognized by the
converter), is accepted for backwards compatibility with
resource specifications written for the Xaw6 Text widget,
but ignored (effectively treated as XawtextScrollNever).</p>

<p>TEXT SOURCE OBJECT The textSrcObject allows display of
its contents to more than one win- dow, and also stores undo
information. The new resources for the textSrcObject
are:</p>

<p>callback (Class Callback) Previous versions of Xaw had
this resource in subclasses of the TextSource object. This
was changed to make it possible to tell the callback the
state of the text when undo is enabled.</p>

<p>enableUndo (Class Undo) A boolean resource that enables
or disables the undo function. The default value is
False.</p>

<p>sourceChanged (Class Changed) Like the callback
resource, this resource was previously in subclasses of the
TextSource object. It is now in the textSr- cObject to
control the changed/unchanged state when undo is
enabled.</p>

<p>TEXT SINK OBJECT The textSinkObject subclasses
asciiSinkObject and multiSinkObject have been changed
slightly to use a new cursor shape (no longer a caret at the
baseline) that indicates the input focus of the text widget,
and allow specification of the cursor color. The new
resource is:</p>

<p>cursorColor (Class Color) Sets the cursor color of the
text. This color is also used to draw selected text.</p>

<p>SIMPLE MENU WIDGET The simpleMenuWidget algorithm to lay
out menu entries has been changed to enable multiple columns
when a single column does not fit on the screen. It was also
modified to enable submenus.</p>

<p>SME BSB OBJECT A new resource has been added to the
smeBSBObject to allow binding sub- menus to it. The new
resource is:</p>

<p>menuName (Class MenuName) Specifies the name of the
popup widget to be popped up when the pointer is over the
menu entry, or NULL. Note that the named menu must be a
child of the popup parent of the smeBSBObject.</p>
