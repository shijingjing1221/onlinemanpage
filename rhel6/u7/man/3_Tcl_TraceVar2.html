<p>Tcl_TraceVar(3) Tcl Library Procedures
Tcl_TraceVar(3)</p>


<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME Tcl_TraceVar, Tcl_TraceVar2, Tcl_UntraceVar,
Tcl_UntraceVar2, Tcl_Var- TraceInfo, Tcl_VarTraceInfo2 -
monitor accesses to a variable</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tcl.h&gt;</p>

<p>int Tcl_TraceVar(interp, varName, flags, proc,
clientData)</p>

<p>int Tcl_TraceVar2(interp, name1, name2, flags, proc,
clientData)</p>

<p>Tcl_UntraceVar(interp, varName, flags, proc,
clientData)</p>

<p>Tcl_UntraceVar2(interp, name1, name2, flags, proc,
clientData)</p>

<p>ClientData Tcl_VarTraceInfo(interp, varName, flags,
proc, prevClientData)</p>

<p>ClientData Tcl_VarTraceInfo2(interp, name1, name2,
flags, proc, prevClientData)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS Tcl_Interp *interp (in) Interpreter containing
variable.</p>

<p>const char *varName (in) Name of variable. May refer to
a scalar vari- able, to an array vari- able with no index,
or to an array variable with a parenthesized index.</p>

<p>int flags (in) OR-ed combination of the values
TCL_TRACE_READS, TCL_TRACE_WRITES, TCL_TRACE_UNSETS,
TCL_TRACE_ARRAY, TCL_GLOBAL_ONLY, TCL_NAMESPACE_ONLY,
TCL_TRACE_RESULT_DYNAMIC and TCL_TRACE_RESULT_OBJECT. Not
all flags are used by all procedures. See below for more
informa- tion.</p>

<p>Tcl_VarTraceProc *proc (in) Procedure to invoke when-
ever one of the traced operations occurs.</p>

<p>ClientData clientData (in) Arbitrary one-word value to
pass to proc.</p>

<p>const char *name1 (in) Name of scalar or array variable
(without array index).</p>

<p>const char *name2 (in) For a trace on an element of an
array, gives the index of the element. For traces on scalar
variables or on whole arrays, is NULL.</p>

<p>ClientData prevClientData (in) If non-NULL, gives last
value returned by Tcl_VarTraceInfo or Tcl_VarTraceInfo2, so
this call will return information about next trace. If NULL,
this call will return informa- tion about first trace.
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Tcl_TraceVar allows a C procedure to monitor
and control access to a Tcl variable, so that the C
procedure is invoked whenever the variable is read or
written or unset. If the trace is created successfully then
Tcl_TraceVar returns TCL_OK. If an error occurred (e.g.
varName speci- fies an element of an array, but the actual
variable is not an array) then TCL_ERROR is returned and an
error message is left in the inter- preters result.</p>

<p>The flags argument to Tcl_TraceVar indicates when the
trace procedure is to be invoked and provides information
for setting up the trace. It consists of an OR-ed
combination of any of the following values:</p>

<p>TCL_GLOBAL_ONLY Normally, the variable will be looked up
at the current level of procedure call; if this bit is set
then the variable will be looked up at global level,
ignoring any active procedures.</p>

<p>TCL_NAMESPACE_ONLY Normally, the variable will be looked
up at the current level of procedure call; if this bit is
set then the variable will be looked up in the current
namespace, ignoring any active proce- dures.</p>

<p>TCL_TRACE_READS Invoke proc whenever an attempt is made
to read the variable.</p>

<p>TCL_TRACE_WRITES Invoke proc whenever an attempt is made
to modify the variable.</p>

<p>TCL_TRACE_UNSETS Invoke proc whenever the variable is
unset. A variable may be unset either explicitly by an unset
command, or implicitly when a procedure returns (its local
variables are automatically unset) or when the interpreter
is deleted (all variables are automatically unset).</p>

<p>TCL_TRACE_ARRAY Invoke proc whenever the array command
is invoked. This gives the trace procedure a chance to
update the array before array names or array get is called.
Note that this is called before an array set, but that will
trigger write traces.</p>

<p>TCL_TRACE_RESULT_DYNAMIC The result of invoking the proc
is a dynamically allocated string that will be released by
the Tcl library via a call to ckfree. Must not be specified
at the same time as TCL_TRACE_RESULT_OBJECT.</p>

<p>TCL_TRACE_RESULT_OBJECT The result of invoking the proc
is a Tcl_Obj* (cast to a char*) with a reference count of at
least one. The ownership of that reference will be
transferred to the Tcl core for release (when the core has
finished with it) via a call to Tcl_DecrRefCount. Must not
be specified at the same time as
TCL_TRACE_RESULT_DYNAMIC.</p>

<p>Whenever one of the specified operations occurs on the
variable, proc will be invoked. It should have arguments and
result that match the type Tcl_VarTraceProc: typedef char
*Tcl_VarTraceProc( ClientData clientData, Tcl_Interp
*interp, char *name1, char *name2, int flags); The
clientData and interp parameters will have the same values
as those passed to Tcl_TraceVar when the trace was created.
ClientData typi- cally points to an application-specific
data structure that describes what to do when proc is
invoked. Name1 and name2 give the name of the traced
variable in the normal two-part form (see the description of
Tcl_TraceVar2 below for details). Flags is an OR-ed
combination of bits providing several pieces of information.
One of the bits TCL_TRACE_READS, TCL_TRACE_WRITES,
TCL_TRACE_ARRAY, or TCL_TRACE_UNSETS will be set in flags to
indicate which operation is being performed on the variable.
The bit TCL_GLOBAL_ONLY will be set whenever the vari- able
being accessed is a global one not accessible from the
current level of procedure call: the trace procedure will
need to pass this flag back to variable-related procedures
like Tcl_GetVar if it attempts to access the variable. The
bit TCL_NAMESPACE_ONLY will be set when- ever the variable
being accessed is a namespace one not accessible from the
current level of procedure call: the trace procedure will
need to pass this flag back to variable-related procedures
like Tcl_GetVar if it attempts to access the variable. The
bit TCL_TRACE_DESTROYED will be set in flags if the trace is
about to be destroyed; this informa- tion may be useful to
proc so that it can clean up its own internal data
structures (see the section TCL_TRACE_DESTROYED below for
more details). Lastly, the bit TCL_INTERP_DESTROYED will be
set if the entire interpreter is being destroyed. When this
bit is set, proc must be especially careful in the things it
does (see the section TCL_INTERP_DESTROYED below). The trace
procedures return value should normally be NULL; see ERROR
RETURNS below for information on other possibilities.</p>

<p>Tcl_UntraceVar may be used to remove a trace. If the
variable speci- fied by interp, varName, and flags has a
trace set with flags, proc, and clientData, then the
corresponding trace is removed. If no such trace exists,
then the call to Tcl_UntraceVar has no effect. The same bits
are valid for flags as for calls to Tcl_TraceVar.</p>

<p>Tcl_VarTraceInfo may be used to retrieve information
about traces set on a given variable. The return value from
Tcl_VarTraceInfo is the clientData associated with a
particular trace. The trace must be on the variable
specified by the interp, varName, and flags arguments (only
the TCL_GLOBAL_ONLY and TCL_NAMESPACE_ONLY bits from flags
is used; other bits are ignored) and its trace procedure
must the same as the proc argument. If the prevClientData
argument is NULL then the return value corresponds to the
first (most recently created) matching trace, or NULL if
there are no matching traces. If the prevClientData argument
is not NULL, then it should be the return value from a
previ- ous call to Tcl_VarTraceInfo. In this case, the new
return value will correspond to the next matching trace
after the one whose clientData matches prevClientData, or
NULL if no trace matches prevClientData or if there are no
more matching traces after it. This mechanism makes it
possible to step through all of the traces for a given
variable that have the same proc.</p>

<p>TWO-PART NAMES The procedures Tcl_TraceVar2,
Tcl_UntraceVar2, and Tcl_VarTraceInfo2 are identical to
Tcl_TraceVar, Tcl_UntraceVar, and Tcl_VarTraceInfo,
respectively, except that the name of the variable consists
of two parts. Name1 gives the name of a scalar variable or
array, and name2 gives the name of an element within an
array. When name2 is NULL, name1 may contain both an array
and an element name: if the name con- tains an open
parenthesis and ends with a close parenthesis, then the
value between the parentheses is treated as an element name
(which can have any string value) and the characters before
the first open paren- thesis are treated as the name of an
array variable. If name2 is NULL and name1 does not refer to
an array element it means that either the variable is a
scalar or the trace is to be set on the entire array rather
than an individual element (see WHOLE-ARRAY TRACES below for
more information).</p>

<p>ACCESSING VARIABLES DURING TRACES During read, write,
and array traces, the trace procedure can read, write, or
unset the traced variable using Tcl_GetVar2, Tcl_SetVar2,
and other procedures. While proc is executing, traces are
temporarily dis- abled for the variable, so that calls to
Tcl_GetVar2 and Tcl_SetVar2 will not cause proc or other
trace procedures to be invoked again. Disabling only occurs
for the variable whose trace procedure is active; accesses
to other variables will still be traced. However, if a vari-
able is unset during a read or write trace then unset traces
will be invoked.</p>

<p>During unset traces the variable has already been
completely expunged. It is possible for the trace procedure
to read or write the variable, but this will be a new
version of the variable. Traces are not dis- abled during
unset traces as they are for read and write traces, but
existing traces have been removed from the variable before
any trace procedures are invoked. If new traces are set by
unset trace proce- dures, these traces will be invoked on
accesses to the variable by the trace procedures.</p>

<p>CALLBACK TIMING When read tracing has been specified for
a variable, the trace proce- dure will be invoked whenever
the variables value is read. This includes set Tcl commands,
$-notation in Tcl commands, and invocations of the
Tcl_GetVar and Tcl_GetVar2 procedures. Proc is invoked just
before the variables value is returned. It may modify the
value of the variable to affect what is returned by the
traced access. If it unsets the variable then the access
will return an error just as if the variable never
existed.</p>

<p>When write tracing has been specified for a variable,
the trace proce- dure will be invoked whenever the variables
value is modified. This includes set commands, commands that
modify variables as side effects (such as catch and scan),
and calls to the Tcl_SetVar and Tcl_SetVar2 procedures).
Proc will be invoked after the variable s value has been
modified, but before the new value of the variable has been
returned. It may modify the value of the variable to
override the change and to determine the value actually
returned by the traced access. If it deletes the variable
then the traced access will return an empty string.</p>

<p>When array tracing has been specified, the trace
procedure will be invoked at the beginning of the array
command implementation, before any of the operations like
get, set, or names have been invoked. The trace procedure
can modify the array elements with Tcl_SetVar and
Tcl_SetVar2.</p>

<p>When unset tracing has been specified, the trace
procedure will be invoked whenever the variable is
destroyed. The traces will be called after the variable has
been completely unset.</p>

<p>WHOLE-ARRAY TRACES If a call to Tcl_TraceVar or
Tcl_TraceVar2 specifies the name of an array variable
without an index into the array, then the trace will be set
on the array as a whole. This means that proc will be
invoked whenever any element of the array is accessed in the
ways specified by flags. When an array is unset, a
whole-array trace will be invoked just once, with name1
equal to the name of the array and name2 NULL; it will not
be invoked once for each element.</p>

<p>MULTIPLE TRACES It is possible for multiple traces to
exist on the same variable. When this happens, all of the
trace procedures will be invoked on each access, in order
from most-recently-created to least-recently-created. When
there exist whole-array traces for an array as well as
traces on individual elements, the whole-array traces are
invoked before the individual-element traces. If a read or
write trace unsets the vari- able then all of the unset
traces will be invoked but the remainder of the read and
write traces will be skipped.</p>

<p>ERROR RETURNS Under normal conditions trace procedures
should return NULL, indicating successful completion. If
proc returns a non-NULL value it signifies that an error
occurred. The return value must be a pointer to a static
character string containing an error message, unless
(exactly one of) the TCL_TRACE_RESULT_DYNAMIC and
TCL_TRACE_RESULT_OBJECT flags is set, which specify that the
result is either a dynamic string (to be released with
ckfree) or a Tcl_Obj* (cast to char* and to be released with
Tcl_DecrRefCount) containing the error message. If a trace
proce- dure returns an error, no further traces are invoked
for the access and the traced access aborts with the given
message. Trace procedures can use this facility to make
variables read-only, for example (but note that the value of
the variable will already have been modified before the
trace procedure is called, so the trace procedure will have
to restore the correct value).</p>

<p>The return value from proc is only used during read and
write tracing. During unset traces, the return value is
ignored and all relevant trace procedures will always be
invoked.</p>

<p>RESTRICTIONS A trace procedure can be called at any
time, even when there is a par- tially formed result in the
interpreters result area. If the trace procedure does
anything that could damage this result (such as calling
Tcl_Eval) then it must save the original values of the
interpreters result and freeProc fields and restore them
before it returns.</p>

<p>UNDEFINED VARIABLES It is legal to set a trace on an
undefined variable. The variable will still appear to be
undefined until the first time its value is set. If an
undefined variable is traced and then unset, the unset will
fail with an error (no such variable), but the trace
procedure will still be invoked.</p>

<p>TCL_TRACE_DESTROYED FLAG In an unset callback to proc,
the TCL_TRACE_DESTROYED bit is set in flags if the trace is
being removed as part of the deletion. Traces on a variable
are always removed whenever the variable is deleted; the
only time TCL_TRACE_DESTROYED is not set is for a
whole-array trace invoked when only a single element of an
array is unset.</p>

<p>TCL_INTERP_DESTROYED When an interpreter is destroyed,
unset traces are called for all of its variables. The
TCL_INTERP_DESTROYED bit will be set in the flags argument
passed to the trace procedures. Trace procedures must be
extremely careful in what they do if the
TCL_INTERP_DESTROYED bit is set. It is not safe for the
procedures to invoke any Tcl procedures on the interpreter,
since its state is partially deleted. All that trace
procedures should do under these circumstances is to clean
up and free their own internal data structures.</p>

<p>BUGS Tcl does not do any error checking to prevent trace
procedures from misusing the interpreter during traces with
TCL_INTERP_DESTROYED set.</p>

<p>Array traces are not yet integrated with the Tcl info
exists command, nor is there Tcl-level access to array
traces.</p>
