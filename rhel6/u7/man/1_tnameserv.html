<p>Name Java IDL: Transient Naming Service - tnameserv</p>

<p>This document discusses using the Java IDL Transient
Naming Service, tnameserv. Java IDL also includes the Object
Request Broker Daemon (ORBD). ORBD is a daemon process
containing a Bootstrap Service, a Transient Naming Service,
a Persistent Naming Service, and a Server Manager. The Java
IDL tutorials all use ORBD, however, you can substi- tute
tnameserv for orbd in any of the examples that use a
Transient Naming Service. For documentation on the orbd
tool, link to its orbd(1) or the Java IDL Naming Service
Included with ORBD @
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/idl/jidlNam-
ing.html topic.</p>

<p>Topics in this section include:</p>

<p>Java IDL Transient Naming Service The CORBA COS (Common
Object Services) Naming Service provides a tree-like
directory for object references much like a filesystem pro-
vides a directory structure for files. The Transient Naming
Service provided with Java IDL, tnameserv, is a simple
implementation of the COS Naming Service specification.</p>

<p>Object references are stored in the namespace by name
and each object reference-name pair is called a name
binding. Name bindings may be organized under naming
contexts. Naming contexts are themselves name bindings and
serve the same organizational function as a file system
subdirectory. All bindings are stored under the initial
naming context. The initial naming context is the only
persistent binding in the names- pace; the rest of the
namespace is lost if the Java IDL naming service process
halts and restarts.</p>

<p>For an applet or application to use COS naming, its ORB
must know the port of a host running a naming service or
have access to a stringified initial naming context for that
naming service. The naming service can either be the Java
IDL naming service or another COS-compliant naming
service.</p>

<p>Starting the Java IDL Transient Naming Service You must
start the Java IDL naming service before an application or
applet that uses its naming service. Installation of the
Java IDL prod- uct creates a script (Solaris: tnameserv) or
executable file (Windows NT: tnameserv.exe) that starts the
Java IDL naming service. Start the naming service so it runs
in the background.</p>

<p>If you do not specify otherwise, the Java IDL naming
service listens on port 900 for the bootstrap protocol used
to implement the ORB resolve_initial_references() and
list_initial_references() methods, as follows:</p>

<p>tnameserv -ORBInitialPort nameserverport&amp;</p>

<p>If you do not specify the name server port, port 900 is
used by default. When running Solaris software, you must
become root to start a process on a port under 1024. For
this reason, we recommend that you use a port number greater
than or equal to 1024. To specify a different port, for
example, 1050, and to run the naming service in the back-
ground, from a UNIX command shell, enter:</p>

<p>tnameserv -ORBInitialPort 1050&amp;</p>

<p>From an MS-DOS system prompt (Windows), enter:</p>

<p>start tnameserv -ORBInitialPort 1050</p>

<p>Clients of the name server must be made aware of the new
port number. Do this by setting the
org.omg.CORBA.ORBInitialPort property to the new port number
when creating the ORB object.</p>

<p>Running the server and client on different hosts In most
of the Java IDL and RMI-IIOP tutorials, the Naming Service,
Server, and Client are all running on the development
machine. In real world deployment, it is likely that the
client and server will run on different host machines than
the Naming Service.</p>

<p>For the client and server to find the Naming Service,
they must be made aware of the port number and host on which
the naming service is run- ning. Do this by setting the
org.omg.CORBA.ORBInitialPort and
org.omg.CORBA.ORBInitialHost properties in the client and
server files to the machine name and port number on which
the Naming Service is run- ning. An example of this is shown
in The Hello World Example Using RMI-IIOP @
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/rmi-iiop/rmii-
iopexample.html. You could also use the command line options
-ORBIni- tialPort nameserverport# and -ORBInitialHost
nameserverhostname to tell the client and server where to
find the Naming Service. Java IDL: Run- ning the Hello World
Example on TWO Machines @
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/idl/tuto-
rial/jidl2machines.html shows one way of doing this using
the command line option.</p>

<p>For example, suppose the Transient Naming Service,
tnameserv is running on port 1050 on host nameserverhost.
The client is running on host clienthost and the server is
running on host serverhost.</p>

<p>o Start tnameserv on the host nameserverhost, as
follows:</p>

<p>tnameserv -ORBInitialPort 1050</p>

<p>o Start the server on the serverhost, as follows:</p>

<p>java Server -ORBInitialPort 1050 -ORBInitialHost
nameserverhost</p>

<p>o Start the client on the clienthost, as follows:</p>

<p>java Client -ORBInitialPort 1050 -ORBInitialHost
nameserverhost</p>

<p>The -J option This command-line option is available for
use with tnameserve:</p>

<p>-Joption Pass option to the Java virtual machine, where
option is one of the options described on the reference page
for java(1). For example, -J-Xms48m sets the startup memory
to 48 megabytes. It is a common convention for -J to pass
options to the underlying vir- tual machine.</p>

<p>Stopping the Java IDL Transient Naming Service To stop
the Java IDL naming service, use the relevant operating
system command, such as kill for a Unix process, or Ctrl-C
for a Windows pro- cess. The naming service will continue to
wait for invocations until it is explicitly shutdown. Note
that names registered with the Java IDL naming service
disappear when the service is terminated.</p>

<p>Sample Client: Adding Objects to the Namespace The
following sample program illustrates how to add names to the
names- pace. It is a self-contained Transient Naming Service
client that cre- ates the following simple tree.</p>

<p>o Initial Naming Context</p>

<p>* plans</p>

<p>* Personal</p>

<p>- calendar</p>

<p>- schedule</p>

<p>In this example, plans is an object reference and
Personal is a naming context that contains two object
references: calendar and schedule.</p>

<p>import java.util.Properties; import org.omg.CORBA.*;
import org.omg.CosNaming.*;</p>

<p>public class NameClient { public static void main(String
args[]) { try {</p>

<p>In the above section, Starting the Java IDL Transient
Naming Service, the nameserver was started on port 1050. The
following code ensures that the client program is aware of
this port number.</p>

<p>Properties props = new Properties();
props.put(&quot;org.omg.CORBA.ORBInitialPort&quot;,
&quot;1050&quot;); ORB orb = ORB.init(args, props);</p>

<p>This code obtains the initial naming context and assigns
it to ctx. The second line copies ctx into a dummy object
reference objref that well attach to various names and add
into the namespace.</p>

<p>NamingContext ctx =
NamingContextHelper.narrow(orb.resolve_initial_references(&quot;NameService&quot;));
NamingContext objref = ctx;</p>

<p>This code creates a name &quot;plans&quot; of type
&quot;text&quot; and binds it to our dummy object reference.
&quot;plans&quot; is then added under the initial naming
context using rebind. The rebind method allows us to run
this program over and over again without getting the
exceptions wed get from using bind.</p>

<p>NameComponent nc1 = new NameComponent(&quot;plans&quot;,
&quot;text&quot;); NameComponent[] name1 = {nc1};
ctx.rebind(name1, objref); System.out.println(&quot;plans
rebind successful!&quot;);</p>

<p>This code creates a naming context called
&quot;Personal&quot; of type &quot;direc- tory&quot;. The
resulting object reference, ctx2, is bound to the name and
added under the initial naming context.</p>

<p>NameComponent nc2 = new
NameComponent(&quot;Personal&quot;, &quot;directory&quot;);
NameComponent[] name2 = {nc2}; NamingContext ctx2 =
ctx.bind_new_context(name2); System.out.println(&quot;new
naming context added..&quot;);</p>

<p>The remainder of the code binds the dummy object
reference using the names &quot;schedule&quot; and
&quot;calendar&quot; under the &quot;Personal&quot; naming
context (ctx2).</p>

<p>NameComponent nc3 = new
NameComponent(&quot;schedule&quot;, &quot;text&quot;);
NameComponent[] name3 = {nc3}; ctx2.rebind(name3, objref);
System.out.println(&quot;schedule rebind
successful!&quot;);</p>

<p>NameComponent nc4 = new
NameComponent(&quot;calender&quot;, &quot;text&quot;);
NameComponent[] name4 = {nc4}; ctx2.rebind(name4, objref);
System.out.println(&quot;calender rebind
successful!&quot;);</p>

<p>} catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(System.err); }
} }</p>

<p>Sample Client: Browsing the Namespace The following
sample program illustrates how to browse the namespace.</p>

<p>import java.util.Properties; import org.omg.CORBA.*;
import org.omg.CosNaming.*;</p>

<p>public class NameClientList { public static void
main(String args[]) { try {</p>

<p>In the above section, Starting the Java IDL Transient
Naming Service, the nameserver was started on port 1050. The
following code ensures that the client program is aware of
this port number.</p>

<p>Properties props = new Properties();
props.put(&quot;org.omg.CORBA.ORBInitialPort&quot;,
&quot;1050&quot;); ORB orb = ORB.init(args, props);</p>

<p>The following code obtains the initial naming
context.</p>

<p>NamingContext nc =
NamingContextHelper.narrow(orb.resolve_initial_references(&quot;NameService&quot;));</p>

<p>The list method lists the bindings in the naming
context. In this case, up to 1000 bindings from the initial
naming context will be returned in the BindingListHolder;
any remaining bindings are returned in the
BindingIteratorHolder.</p>

<p>BindingListHolder bl = new BindingListHolder();
BindingIteratorHolder blIt= new BindingIteratorHolder();
nc.list(1000, bl, blIt);</p>

<p>This code gets the array of bindings out of the returned
Bind- ingListHolder. If there are no bindings, the program
ends.</p>

<p>Binding bindings[] = bl.value; if (bindings.length == 0)
return;</p>

<p>The remainder of the code loops through the bindings and
prints the names out.</p>

<p>for (int i=0; i &lt; bindings.length; i++) {</p>

<p>// get the object reference for each binding
org.omg.CORBA.Object obj =
nc.resolve(bindings[i].binding_name); String objStr =
orb.object_to_string(obj); int lastIx =
bindings[i].binding_name.length-1;</p>

<p>// check to see if this is a naming context if
(bindings[i].binding_type == BindingType.ncontext) {
System.out.println( &quot;Context: &quot; +
bindings[i].binding_name[lastIx].id); } else {
System.out.println(&quot;Object: &quot; +
bindings[i].binding_name[lastIx].id); } }</p>

<p>} catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(System.err); }
} }</p>
