<p>NAME TIFFReadRGBAStrip - read and decode an image strip
into a fixed-format raster</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tiffio.h&gt;</p>

<p>#define TIFFGetR(abgr) ((abgr) &amp; 0xff) #define
TIFFGetG(abgr) (((abgr) &gt;&gt; 8) &amp; 0xff) #define
TIFFGetB(abgr) (((abgr) &gt;&gt; 16) &amp; 0xff) #define
TIFFGetA(abgr) (((abgr) &gt;&gt; 24) &amp; 0xff)</p>

<p>int TIFFReadRGBAStrip(TIFF *tif, uint32 row, uint32
*raster)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION TIFFReadRGBAStrip reads a single strip of a
strip-based image into mem- ory, storing the result in the
user supplied RGBA raster. The raster is assumed to be an
array of width times rowsperstrip 32-bit entries, where
width is the width of the image (TIFFTAG_IMAGEWIDTH) and
rowsper- strip is the maximum lines in a strip
(TIFFTAG_ROWSPERSTRIP).</p>

<p>The row value should be the row of the first row in the
strip (strip * rowsperstrip, zero based).</p>

<p>Note that the raster is assume to be organized such that
the pixel at location (x,y) is raster[y*width+x]; with the
raster origin in the lower-left hand corner of the strip.
That is bottom to top organiza- tion. When reading a partial
last strip in the file the last line of the image will begin
at the beginning of the buffer.</p>

<p>Raster pixels are 8-bit packed red, green, blue, alpha
samples. The macros TIFFGetR, TIFFGetG, TIFFGetB, and
TIFFGetA should be used to access individual samples. Images
without Associated Alpha matting information have a constant
Alpha of 1.0 (255).</p>

<p>See the TIFFRGBAImage(3TIFF) page for more details on
how various image types are converted to RGBA values.</p>

<p>NOTES Samples must be either 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 bits.
Colorimetric sam- ples/pixel must be either 1, 3, or 4 (i.e.
SamplesPerPixel minus ExtraSamples).</p>

<p>Palette image colormaps that appear to be incorrectly
written as 8-bit values are automatically scaled to
16-bits.</p>

<p>TIFFReadRGBAStrip is just a wrapper around the more
general TIFFRGBAIm- age(3TIFF) facilities. It s main
advantage over the similar TIFFRead- RGBAImage() function is
that for large images a single buffer capable of holding the
whole image doesnt need to be allocated, only enough for one
strip. The TIFFReadRGBATile() function does a similar opera-
tion for tiled images.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUES 1 is returned if the image was
successfully read and converted. Other- wise, 0 is returned
if an error was encountered.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS All error messages are directed to the
TIFFError(3TIFF) routine.</p>

<p>Sorry, can not handle %d-bit pictures. The image had
BitsPerSample other than 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16.</p>

<p>Sorry, can not handle %d-channel images. The image had
SamplesPerPixel other than 1, 3, or 4.</p>

<p>Missing needed &quot;PhotometricInterpretation&quot;
tag. The image did not have a tag that describes how to
display the data.</p>

<p>No &quot;PhotometricInterpretation&quot; tag, assuming
RGB. The image was miss- ing a tag that describes how to
display it, but because it has 3 or 4 samples/pixel, it is
assumed to be RGB.</p>

<p>No &quot;PhotometricInterpretation&quot; tag, assuming
min-is-black. The image was missing a tag that describes how
to display it, but because it has 1 sample/pixel, it is
assumed to be a grayscale or bilevel image.</p>

<p>No space for photometric conversion table. There was
insufficient mem- ory for a table used to convert image
samples to 8-bit RGB.</p>

<p>Missing required &quot;Colormap&quot; tag. A Palette
image did not have a required Colormap tag.</p>

<p>No space for tile buffer. There was insufficient memory
to allocate an i/o buffer.</p>

<p>No space for strip buffer. There was insufficient memory
to allocate an i/o buffer.</p>

<p>Can not handle format. The image has a format
(combination of BitsPer- Sample, SamplesPerPixel, and
PhotometricInterpretation) that TIFFRead- RGBAImage can not
handle.</p>

<p>No space for B&amp;W mapping table. There was
insufficient memory to allo- cate a table used to map
grayscale data to RGB.</p>

<p>No space for Palette mapping table. There was
insufficient memory to allocate a table used to map data to
8-bit RGB.</p>
