<p>rlm_pap(5) FreeRADIUS Module rlm_pap(5)</p>

<p>NAME rlm_pap - FreeRADIUS Module</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The rlm_pap module authenticates RADIUS
Access-Request packets that contain a User-Password
attribute. The module should also be listed last in the
authorize section, so that it can set the Auth-Type
attribute as appropriate.</p>

<p>When a RADIUS packet contains a clear-text password in
the form of a User-Password attribute, the rlm_pap module
may be used for authentica- tion. The module requires a
&quot;known good&quot; password, which it uses to validate
the password given in the RADIUS packet. That &quot;known
good&quot; password must be supplied by another module (e.g.
rlm_files, rlm_ldap, etc.), and is usually taken from a
database.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION The only relevant configuration item
is:</p>

<p>auto_header If set to &quot;yes&quot;, the module will
look inside of the User-Pass- word attribute for the headers
{crypt}, {clear}, etc., and will automatically create the
appropriate attribute, with the correct value.</p>

<p>This module understands many kinds of password hashing
methods, as given by the following table.</p>

<p>Header Attribute Description ------ ---------
----------- {clear} Cleartext-Password clear-text passwords
{cleartext} Cleartext-Password clear-text passwords {crypt}
Crypt-Password Unix-style &quot;crypt&quot;ed passwords
{md5} MD5-Password MD5 hashed passwords {smd5} SMD5-Password
MD5 hashed passwords, with a salt {sha} SHA-Password SHA1
hashed passwords {ssha} SSHA-Password SHA1 hashed passwords,
with a salt {nt} NT-Password Windows NT hashed passwords
{x-nthash} NT-Password Windows NT hashed passwords {lm}
LM-Password Windows Lan Manager (LM) passwords.</p>

<p>The module tries to be flexible when handling the
various password for- mats. It will automatically handle
Base-64 encoded data, hex strings, and binary data, and
convert them to a format that the server can use.</p>

<p>It is important to understand the difference between the
User-Password and Cleartext-Password attributes. The
Cleartext-Password attribute is the &quot;known good&quot;
password for the user. Simply supplying the Cleart-
ext-Password to the server will result in most
authentication methods working. The User-Password attribute
is the password as typed in by the user on their private
machine. The two are not the same, and should be treated
very differently. That is, you should generally not use the
User-Password attribute anywhere in the RADIUS
configuration.</p>

<p>For backwards compatibility, there are old configuration
parameters which may be work, although we do not recommend
using them.</p>
