The fence_kdump_send utility is typically run from within
the kdump kernel after a cluster node has encountered a
kernel panic. Once the cluster node has entered the kdump
crash recovery service, fence_kdump_send will periodically
send messages to all cluster nodes. When the fence_kdump
agent receives a valid message from the failed node, fenc-

<p>-c, --count=COUNT Number of messages to send. If COUNT
