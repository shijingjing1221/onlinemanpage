<p>NAME lvmdump create lvm2 information dumps for
diagnostic purposes</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS lvmdump [-a] [-c] [-d directory] [-h] [-l] [-m]
[-s] [-u]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION lvmdump is a tool to dump various
information concerning LVM2. By default, it creates a
tarball suitable for submission along with a problem
report.</p>

<p>The content of the tarball is as follows: - dmsetup info
- table of currently running processes - recent entries from
/var/log/messages (containing system messages) - complete
lvm configuration and cache (content of /etc/lvm) - list of
device nodes present under /dev - list of files present
/sys/block - list of files present
/sys/devices/virtual/block - if enabled with -m, metadata
dump will be also included - if enabled with -a, debug
output of vgscan, pvscan and list of all available volume
groups, physical volumes and logical volumes will be
included - if enabled with -c, cluster status info - if
enabled with -l, lvmetad state if running - if enabled with
-s, system info and context - if enabled with -u, udev info
and context</p>

<p>OPTIONS -a Advanced collection. WARNING: if lvm is
already hung, then this script may hang as well if -a is
used.</p>

<p>-c If clvmd is running, gather cluster data as well.</p>

<p>-d directory Dump into a directory instead of tarball By
default, lvmdump will produce a single compressed tarball
containing all the information. Using this option, it can be
instructed to only produce the raw dump tree, rooted in
directory.</p>

<p>-h Print help message</p>

<p>-l Include lvmetad(8) daemon dump if it is running. The
dump con- tains cached information that is currently stored
in lvmetad: VG metadata, PV metadata and various mappings in
between these metadata for quick access.</p>

<p>-m Gather LVM metadata from the PVs This option
generates a 1:1 dump of the metadata area from all PVs
visible to the system, which can cause the dump to increase
in size considerably. How- ever, the metadata dump may
represent a valuable diagnostic resource.</p>

<p>-s Gather system info and context. Currently, this
encompasses sys- temd info and context only: overall state
of systemd units present in the system, more detailed status
of units controlling LVM functionality and the content of
systemd journal for current boot.</p>

<p>-u Gather udev info and context: /etc/udev/udev.conf
file, udev daemon version (output of udevadm info --version
command), udev rules currently used in the system (content
of /lib/udev/rules.d and /etc/udev/rules.d directory), list
of files in /lib/udev directory and dump of current udev
database content (the output of udevadm info --export-db
command).</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES LVM_BINARY The LVM2 binary to use.
Defaults to &quot;lvm&quot;. Sometimes you might need to set
this to &quot;/sbin/lvm.static&quot;, for example.</p>

<p>DMSETUP_BINARY The dmsetup binary to use. Defaults to
&quot;dmsetup&quot;.</p>
