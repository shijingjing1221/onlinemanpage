<p>MKTIME(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual MKTIME(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME mktime - convert broken-down time into time since
the Epoch</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;time.h&gt;</p>

<p>time_t mktime(struct tm *timeptr);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The mktime() function shall convert the
broken-down time, expressed as local time, in the structure
pointed to by timeptr, into a time since the Epoch value
with the same encoding as that of the values returned by
time(). The original values of the tm_wday and tm_yday
components of the structure are ignored, and the original
values of the other compo- nents are not restricted to the
ranges described in &lt;time.h&gt;.</p>

<p>A positive or 0 value for tm_isdst shall cause mktime()
to presume ini- tially that Daylight Savings Time,
respectively, is or is not in effect for the specified time.
A negative value for tm_isdst shall cause mktime() to
attempt to determine whether Daylight Savings Time is in
effect for the specified time.</p>

<p>Local timezone information shall be set as though
mktime() called tzset().</p>

<p>The relationship between the tm structure (defined in
the &lt;time.h&gt; header) and the time in seconds since the
Epoch is that the result shall be as specified in the
expression given in the definition of sec- onds since the
Epoch (see the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001, Section 4.14, Seconds Since the Epoch)
corrected for timezone and any seasonal time adjustments,
where the names in the structure and in the expression
correspond.</p>

<p>Upon successful completion, the values of the tm_wday
and tm_yday com- ponents of the structure shall be set
appropriately, and the other com- ponents are set to
represent the specified time since the Epoch, but with their
values forced to the ranges indicated in the &lt;time.h&gt;
entry; the final value of tm_mday shall not be set until
tm_mon and tm_year are determined.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The mktime() function shall return the
specified time since the Epoch encoded as a value of type
time_t. If the time since the Epoch cannot be represented,
the function shall return the value (time_t)-1.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES What day of the week is July 4, 2001?</p>

<p>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; #include &lt;time.h&gt;</p>

<p>struct tm time_str;</p>

<p>char daybuf[20];</p>

<p>int main(void) { time_str.tm_year = 2001 - 1900;
time_str.tm_mon = 7 - 1; time_str.tm_mday = 4;
time_str.tm_hour = 0; time_str.tm_min = 0; time_str.tm_sec =
1; time_str.tm_isdst = -1; if (mktime(&amp;time_str) == -1)
(void)puts(&quot;-unknown-&quot;); else {
(void)strftime(daybuf, sizeof(daybuf), &quot;%A&quot;,
&amp;time_str); (void)puts(daybuf); } return 0; }</p>
