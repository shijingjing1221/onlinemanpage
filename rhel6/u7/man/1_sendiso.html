<p>sendiso(1) Linux IEEE 1394 sendiso(1)</p>

<p>NAME sendiso - send IEEE 1394 isochronous packets from
dump file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sendiso [ options ] FILE</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION sendiso takes the dump file FILE as
generated by dumpiso(1), extracts the packets and sends them
as they were received (in the same order, with the same
channel numbers) as fast as possible - timing of the
original dump is not preserved.</p>

<p>This program does not allocate any isochronous resources
but just starts sending. It should not be used in live
environments where it might interfere with properly set up
isochronous transmissions, it is a debug and performance
benchmarking tool.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -l, --loop=COUNT Send dump file COUNT times.
Defaults to 1.</p>

<p>-i, --infinite Send dump file in an endless loop.</p>

<p>-s, --speed=SPEED Send packets at speed SPEED, which can
be given as 100, 200 and 400 (in Mbit/s) or abbreviated as
1, 2 and 4. Defaults to 100.</p>

<p>-p, --port=PORT Choose port PORT for sending. A port is
a 1394 card or chip and represents one connected bus,
therefore this is only relevant when you have multiple of
these. Defaults to 0.</p>

<p>-h, --help Show help text and exit.</p>

<p>BUGS None known.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO dumpiso(1), isodump(5)</p>
