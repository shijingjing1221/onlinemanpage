<p>MKNOD(2) Linux Programmer s Manual MKNOD(2)</p>

<p>NAME mknod - create a special or ordinary file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; #include
&lt;sys/stat.h&gt; #include &lt;fcntl.h&gt; #include
&lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>int mknod(const char *pathname, mode_t mode, dev_t
dev);</p>

<p>Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
feature_test_macros(7)):</p>

<p>mknod(): _BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE
&gt;= 500</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The system call mknod() creates a file
system node (file, device spe- cial file or named pipe)
named pathname, with attributes specified by mode and
dev.</p>

<p>The mode argument specifies both the permissions to use
and the type of node to be created. It should be a
combination (using bitwise OR) of one of the file types
listed below and the permissions for the new node.</p>

<p>The permissions are modified by the processs umask in
the usual way: the permissions of the created node are (mode
&amp; ~umask).</p>

<p>The file type must be one of S_IFREG, S_IFCHR, S_IFBLK,
S_IFIFO or S_IFSOCK to specify a regular file (which will be
created empty), char- acter special file, block special
file, FIFO (named pipe), or Unix domain socket,
respectively. (Zero file type is equivalent to type
S_IFREG.)</p>

<p>If the file type is S_IFCHR or S_IFBLK then dev
specifies the major and minor numbers of the newly created
device special file (makedev(3) may be useful to build the
value for dev); otherwise it is ignored.</p>

<p>If pathname already exists, or is a symbolic link, this
call fails with an EEXIST error.</p>

<p>The newly created node will be owned by the effective
user ID of the process. If the directory containing the node
has the set-group-ID bit set, or if the file system is
mounted with BSD group semantics, the new node will inherit
the group ownership from its parent directory; other- wise
it will be owned by the effective group ID of the
process.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE mknod() returns zero on success, or -1 if
an error occurred (in which case, errno is set
appropriately).</p>

<p>ERRORS EACCES The parent directory does not allow write
permission to the pro- cess, or one of the directories in
the path prefix of pathname did not allow search permission.
(See also path_resolution(7).)</p>

<p>EEXIST pathname already exists. This includes the case
where pathname is a symbolic link, dangling or not.</p>

<p>EFAULT pathname points outside your accessible address
space.</p>

<p>EINVAL mode requested creation of something other than a
regular file, device special file, FIFO or socket.</p>

<p>ELOOP Too many symbolic links were encountered in
resolving pathname.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG pathname was too long.</p>

<p>ENOENT A directory component in pathname does not exist
or is a dan- gling symbolic link.</p>

<p>ENOMEM Insufficient kernel memory was available.</p>

<p>ENOSPC The device containing pathname has no room for
the new node.</p>

<p>ENOTDIR A component used as a directory in pathname is
not, in fact, a directory.</p>

<p>EPERM mode requested creation of something other than a
regular file, FIFO (named pipe), or Unix domain socket, and
the caller is not privileged (Linux: does not have the
CAP_MKNOD capability); also returned if the file system
containing pathname does not support the type of node
requested.</p>

<p>EROFS pathname refers to a file on a read-only file
system.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO SVr4, 4.4BSD, POSIX.1-2001 (but see
below).</p>

<p>NOTES POSIX.1-2001 says: &quot;The only portable use of
mknod() is to create a FIFO-special file. If mode is not
S_IFIFO or dev is not 0, the behav- ior of mknod() is
unspecified.&quot; However, nowadays one should never use
mknod() for this purpose; one should use mkfifo(3), a
function espe- cially defined for this purpose.</p>

<p>Under Linux, this call cannot be used to create
directories. One should make directories with mkdir(2).</p>

<p>There are many infelicities in the protocol underlying
NFS. Some of these affect mknod().</p>

<p>SEE ALSO chmod(2), chown(2), fcntl(2), mkdir(2),
mknodat(2), mount(2), socket(2), stat(2), umask(2),
unlink(2), makedev(3), mkfifo(3), path_resolution(7)</p>
