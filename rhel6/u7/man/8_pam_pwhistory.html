<p>NAME pam_pwhistory - PAM module to remember last
passwords</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pam_pwhistory.so [debug] [use_authtok]
[enforce_for_root] [remember=N] [retry=N]
[authtok_type=STRING]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This module saves the last passwords for
each user in order to force password change history and keep
the user from alternating between the same password too
frequently.</p>

<p>This module does not work together with kerberos. In
general, it does not make much sense to use this module in
conjunction with NIS or LDAP, since the old passwords are
stored on the local machine and are not available on another
machine for password history checking.</p>

<p>OPTIONS debug Turns on debugging via syslog(3).</p>

<p>use_authtok When password changing enforce the module to
use the new password provided by a previously stacked
password module (this is used in the example of the stacking
of the pam_cracklib module documented below).</p>

<p>enforce_for_root If this option is set, the check is
enforced for root, too.</p>

<p>remember=N The last N passwords for each user are saved
in /etc/security/opasswd. The default is 10.</p>

<p>retry=N Prompt user at most N times before returning
with error. The default is 1.</p>

<p>authtok_type=STRING See pam_get_authtok(3) for more
details.</p>

<p>MODULE TYPES PROVIDED Only the password module type is
provided.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUES PAM_AUTHTOK_ERR No new password was
entered, the user aborted password change or new password
couldn&acute;t be set.</p>

<p>PAM_IGNORE Password history was disabled.</p>

<p>PAM_MAXTRIES Password was rejected too often.</p>

<p>PAM_USER_UNKNOWN User is not known to system.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES An example password section would be:</p>

<p>#%PAM-1.0 password required pam_pwhistory.so password
required pam_unix.so use_authtok</p>

<p>In combination with pam_cracklib:</p>

<p>#%PAM-1.0 password required pam_cracklib.so retry=3
password required pam_pwhistory.so use_authtok password
required pam_unix.so use_authtok</p>

<p>FILES /etc/security/opasswd File with password
history</p>
