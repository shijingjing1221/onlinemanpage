<p>NAME cups-driverd - cups driver daemon</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS cups-driverd cat ppd-name cups-driverd list
request_id limit options</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION cups-driverd shows or lists PPD files. It is
run in response to CUPS- Add-Modify-Printer or
CUPS-Get-Devices requests. The first form
(&quot;cups-driverd cat ppd-name&quot;) writes the named PPD
file to stdout. The output format is an uncompressed PPD
file.</p>

<p>The second form lists the available manufacturers or PPD
files to std- out as indicated by the options argument. The
output format is an IPP response message. The request_id
argument is the request ID from the original IPP request,
typically 1. The limit argument is the limit value from the
original IPP request - 0 means no limit. Finally, the
options argument is a space-delimited list of attributes
(&quot;name=value name=value ...&quot;) that were passed in
with the request. Currently cups- driverd looks for the
ppd-make and requested-attributes attributes and tailors the
output accordingly.</p>

<p>DRIVERS Drivers can be static PPD files under the
/usr/share/cups/model direc- tory or programs under the
/usr/lib/cups/driver directory. Static PPD files must
conform to the Adobe PPD File Format Specification version
4.3 and may be compressed using the gzip(1) program. Driver
programs must implement the command-line interface shown in
the next section.</p>

<p>DRIVER PROGRAMS Driver programs provide an interface to
dynamically-generated PPD files. The following arguments are
currently defined:</p>

<p>drivername list Lists the supported PPD files to
stdout.</p>

<p>drivername cat ppdname Writes the named PPD file to
stdout.</p>

<p>LISTING FILES (drivername list) When run with the single
argument &quot;list&quot;, the program must list the
available PPD files it can generate to stdout using the
following for- mat: &quot;drivername:ppdname&quot; language
&quot;make&quot; &quot;make and model&quot; &quot;1284
device id&quot;</p>

<p>Drivername is the name of the driver program. Ppdname is
the name used to select the given driver. Language is the
locale associated with the default language of the PPD file,
typically &quot;en&quot;. Make is the Manufac- turer name
from the PPD file. Make and model is the NickName name from
the PPD file. 1284 device id is the 1284DeviceId from the
PPD file, if any.</p>

<p>WRITING FILES (drivername cat ppdname) When the driver
program is run with the &quot;cat ppdname&quot; arguments,
it must write the named PPD file to stdout, uncompressed. If
the named PPD file does not exist, the driver program must
not write any output to stdout and report the error to
stderr instead.</p>

<p>DRIVER ERROR MESSAGES Error messages can be relayed back
to cupsd by writing them to stderr. The following prefixes
are recognized:</p>

<p>DEBUG: [drivername] Debugging messages</p>

<p>ERROR: [drivername] Error messages</p>

<p>INFO: [drivername] Informational messages</p>
