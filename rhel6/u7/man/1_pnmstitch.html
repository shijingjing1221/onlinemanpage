<p>NAME pnmstitch - stitch together two panoramic
(side-by-side) photographs</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pnmstitch [ [left_filespec] right_filespec |
left_filespec right_file- spec output_filespec ]
[-width=width] [-height=height] [-xrightpos=col- umn]
[-yrightpos=row] [-stitcher={RotateSliver,
BiLinearSliver,Lin- earSliver}]
[-filter={LineAtATime,HorizontalCrop}] [-output=out-
put_filespec] [-verbose]</p>

<p>All options can be abbreviated to their shortest unique
prefix. You may use two hyphens instead of one. You may
separate an option name and its value with white space
instead of an equals sign.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pnmstitch stitches together two panoramic photographs.
This means if you have photographs of the left and right
side of something that is too big for a single camera frame,
pnmstitch can join them into one wide picture.</p>

<p>pnmstitch works only on side-by-side images, not top and
bottom (though you could certainly use pamflip in
combination with pnmstitch to achieve this). It stitches
together two images, but you can use it repeatedly to stitch
together as many as you need to.</p>

<p>Your photographs must overlap in order for pnmstitch to
work, and the overlap should be substantial. pnmstitch
shifts and stretches the right hand image to match it up the
left hand image. You probably want to crop the result with
pamcut to make a nice rectangular image.</p>

<p>If youre just trying to join (concatenate) two images at
their edges, use pnmcat.</p>

<p>The left_filespec and right_filespec arguments are the
specifications (names) of the PNM files containing the left
hand and right hand images. If you specify only
right_filespec, the left hand image comes from Standard
Input. If you specify neither, both images come from
Standard Input as a multi-image file containing first the
left and then the right image.</p>

<p>output_filespec is the specification (name) of the
output PNM file. The -output option also specifies the
output file. You cannot specify both the argument and the
option. If you specify neither, the output goes to Standard
Output.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -width=width</p>

<p>-height=height</p>

<p>-xrightpos=column</p>

<p>-yrightpos=row These are constraints on where pnmstitch
stitches the images together. For the LinearSliver method,
column and row tell what location in the right hand image
matches up to the top right corner of the left hand
image.</p>

<p>-stitcher={RotateSliver,BiLinearSliver, LinearSliver}
The default is RotateSliver.</p>

<p>-filter={LineAtATime,HorizontalCrop} No details
available.</p>

<p>-output=output_filespec Name of output file. If you don
t specify this option, the out- put image goes to Standard
Output.</p>

<p>-verbose This option causes pnmstitch to issue messages
to Standard Error about the stitching process.</p>

<p>HISTORY This program was added to Netpbm in Release 10.7
