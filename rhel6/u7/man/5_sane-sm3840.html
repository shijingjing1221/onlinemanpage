<p>sane-sm3840(5) SANE Scanner Access Now Easy
sane-sm3840(5)</p>

<p>NAME sane-sm3840 - SANE backend for Microtek scanners
with SCAN08 USB chip</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sane-sm3840 library implements a SANE
(Scanner Access Now Easy) backend that provides access to
some Microtek scanners with the SCAN08 USB chip.</p>

<p>There exist backends for Microtek scanners with SCSI
command set. Refer to sane-microtek(5) and sane-microtek2(5)
for details.</p>

<p>There also exists a Microtek 3600 series driver, see
sane-sm3600(5) for details.</p>

<p>At present, the following scanners are known positively
to work with this backend:</p>

<p>Vendor Product ID: Remark: -------- --------------
----------- Microtek ScanMaker 3840 All modes OK Microtek
ScanMaker 4800 All modes OK</p>

<p>If you own a Microtek scanner with the SCAN08 chip other
than the ones listed above, it may or may not work with
SANE. Feel free to contact the backend author
(earle@ziplabel.com) to report results with scanners not on
the list.</p>

<p>FRONTEND OPTIONS The following options are supported by
the sm3840-driver:</p>

<p>--mode color|gray|lineart|halftone Color or grayscale
mode.</p>

<p>--resolution 150|300|600|1200 Pixels per inch for
scans.</p>

<p>--depth 8|16 Note that the least significant bits of
16bpp mode may be noise.</p>

<p>--brightness 1..4096 Higher numbers increase brightness
of returned image.</p>

<p>--contrast 0.1..9.9 Larger numbers decrease contrast of
returned image.</p>

<p>--lamp-timeout 1..15 Time in minutes until the lamp is
turned off after a scan.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION This backend does not support a
configuration file right now.</p>

<p>FILES /usr/lib64/sane/libsane-sm3840.a The static
library implementing this backend.</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-sm3840.so The shared library
implementing this backend (present on systems that support
dynamic loading).</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT SANE_DEBUG_SM3840 If the library was
compiled with debug support enabled, this environment
variable controls the debug level for this backend. E.g., a
value of 128 requests all debug output to be printed.
Smaller levels reduce verbosity. To see error messages on
stderr set SANE_DEBUG_SM3840 to 1.</p>
