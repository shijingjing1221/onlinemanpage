<p>NAME XSendExtensionEvent - send input extension events
to a client</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;X11/extensions/XInput.h&gt;</p>

<p>Status XSendExtensionEvent( Display *display, XDevice
*device, Window destination, Bool propagate, int
event_count, XEventClass *event_list, XEvent
*event_send);</p>

<p>display Specifies the connection to the X server.</p>

<p>device Specifies the device from which the events are to
be sent.</p>

<p>destination Specifies the window the event is to be sent
to. You can pass window id, PointerWindow,or InputFocus.</p>

<p>propagate Specifies a Boolean value that is either True
or False.</p>

<p>event_count Specifies the count of XEventClasses in
event_list.</p>

<p>event_list Specifies the list of event selections to be
used.</p>

<p>event_send Specifies a pointer to the event that is to
be sent.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The XSendExtensionEvent request identifies
the destination window, determines which clients should
receive the specified events, and ignores any active grabs.
This request requires you to pass an event class list. For a
discussion of the valid event class names, see
XOpenDevice(3) This request uses the w argument to identify
the destination window as follows: * If w is
PointerWindow,the destination window is the window that
contains the pointer. * If w is InputFocusand if the focus
window contains the pointer,the destination window is the
window that contains the pointer; otherwise, the destination
window is the focus window.</p>

<p>To determine which clients should receive the specified
events, XSendExtensionEventuses the propagate argument as
follows: * If event_list is the empty set,the event is sent
to the client that created the destination window. If that
client no longer exists,no event is sent. * If propagate is
False,the event is sent to every client selecting on
destination any of the eventtypes specified by the
event_list array. * If propagate is Trueand no clients have
selected on destination any ofthe events specified by the
event_list array,the destination is replaced with theclosest
ancestor of destination for which some client has selected
atype specified by the event-list array and for which no
interveningwindow has that type in itsdo-not-propagate-mask.
If no such window exists or if the window isan ancestor of
the focus window and InputFocuswas originally specifiedas
the destination, the event is not sent to any clients.
Otherwise, the event is reported to every client selecting
on the finaldestination any of the events specified in the
event_list array.</p>

<p>The event in the XEventstructure must be one of the
events defined by the input extension (or a BadValueerror
results) so that the X server can correctly byte-swapthe
contents as necessary. The contents of the event
areotherwise unaltered and unchecked by the X server except
to force send_event to Truein the forwarded event and to set
the serial number in the event correctly.</p>

<p>XSendExtensionEventreturns zero if the conversion to
wire protocol format failedand returns nonzero
otherwise.XSendExtensionEventcan generate BadClass,
BadDevice, BadValue, and BadWindow errors.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS BadDevice An invalid device was specified.
The specified device does not exist or has not been opened
by this client via XOpenInputDevice. This error may also
occur if the specified device is the X keyboard or X pointer
device.</p>

<p>BadValue Some numeric value falls outside the range of
values accepted by the request. Unless a specific range is
specified for an argument, the full range defined by the
argument&rsquo;s type is accepted. Any argument defined as a
set of alternatives can generate this error.</p>

<p>BadWindow A value for a Window argument does not name a
defined window.</p>
