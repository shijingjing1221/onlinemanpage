<p>NAME pod2latex - convert pod documentation to latex
format</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pod2latex *.pm</p>

<p>pod2latex -out mytex.tex *.pod</p>

<p>pod2latex -full -sections &rsquo;DESCRIPTION|NAME&rsquo;
SomeDir</p>

<p>pod2latex -prefile h.tex -postfile t.tex my.pod</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION &quot;pod2latex&quot; is a program to
convert POD format documentation (perlpod) into latex. It
can process multiple input documents at a time and either
generate a latex file per input document or a single
combined output file.</p>

<p>OPTIONS AND ARGUMENTS This section describes the
supported command line options. Minimum matching is
supported.</p>

<p>-out Name of the output file to be used. If there are
multiple input pods it is assumed that the intention is to
write all translated output into a single file.
&quot;.tex&quot; is appended if not present. If the argument
is not supplied, a single document will be created for each
input file.</p>

<p>-full Creates a complete &quot;latex&quot; file that can
be processed immediately (unless &quot;=for/=begin&quot;
directives are used that rely on extra packages). Table of
contents and index generation commands are included in the
wrapper &quot;latex&quot; code.</p>

<p>-sections Specify pod sections to include (or remove if
negated) in the translation. See &quot;SECTION
SPECIFICATIONS&quot; in Pod::Select for the format to use
for section-spec. This option may be given multiple times on
the command line.This is identical to the similar option in
the &quot;podselect()&quot; command.</p>

<p>-modify This option causes the output &quot;latex&quot;
to be slightly modified from the input pod such that when a
&quot;=head1 NAME&quot; is encountered a section is created
containing the actual pod name (rather than NAME) and all
subsequent &quot;=head1&quot; directives are treated as
subsections. This has the advantage that the description of
a module will be in its own section which is helpful for
including module descriptions in documentation. Also forces
&quot;latex&quot; label and index entries to be prefixed by
the name of the module.</p>

<p>-h1level Specifies the &quot;latex&quot; section that is
equivalent to a &quot;H1&quot; pod directive. This is an
integer between 0 and 5 with 0 equivalent to a
&quot;latex&quot; chapter, 1 equivalent to a
&quot;latex&quot; section etc. The default is 1
(&quot;H1&quot; equivalent to a latex section).</p>

<p>-help Print a brief help message and exit.</p>

<p>-man Print the manual page and exit.</p>

<p>-verbose Print information messages as each document is
processed.</p>

<p>-preamble A user-supplied preamble for the LaTeX code.
Multiple values are supported and appended in order
separated by &quot;0. See -prefile for reading the preamble
from a file.</p>

<p>-postamble A user supplied postamble for the LaTeX code.
Multiple values are supported and appended in order
separated by &quot;0. See -postfile for reading the
postamble from a file.</p>

<p>-prefile A user-supplied preamble for the LaTeX code to
be read from the named file. Multiple values are supported
and appended in order. See -preamble.</p>

<p>-postfile A user-supplied postamble for the LaTeX code
to be read from the named file. Multiple values are
supported and appended in order. See -postamble.</p>

<p>BUGS Known bugs are:</p>

<p>&middot; Cross references between documents are not
resolved when multiple pod documents are converted into a
single output &quot;latex&quot; file.</p>

<p>&middot; Functions and variables are not automatically
recognized and they will therefore not be marked up in any
special way unless instructed by an explicit pod
command.</p>
