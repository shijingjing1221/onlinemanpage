<p>NAME audit_syscall_entry - fill in an audit record at
syscall entry</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS void audit_syscall_entry(int arch, int major,
unsigned long a1, unsigned long a2, unsigned long a3,
unsigned long a4);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS arch architecture type</p>

<p>major major syscall type (function)</p>

<p>a1 additional syscall register 1</p>

<p>a2 additional syscall register 2</p>

<p>a3 additional syscall register 3</p>

<p>a4 additional syscall register 4</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Fill in audit context at syscall entry. This
only happens if the audit context was created when the task
was created and the state or filters demand the audit
context be built. If the state from the per-task filter or
from the per-syscall filter is AUDIT_RECORD_CONTEXT, then
the record will be written at syscall exit time (otherwise,
it will only be written if another part of the kernel
requests that it be written).</p>
