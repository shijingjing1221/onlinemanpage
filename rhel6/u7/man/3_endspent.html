<p>DESCRIPTION Long ago it was considered safe to have
encrypted passwords openly vis- ible in the password file.
When computers got faster and people got more
security-conscious, this was no longer acceptable. Julianne
Frances Haugh implemented the shadow password suite that
keeps the encrypted passwords in the shadow password
database (e.g., the local shadow password file /etc/shadow,
NIS, and LDAP), readable only by root.</p>

<p>The functions described below resemble those for the
traditional pass- word database (e.g., see getpwnam(3) and
getpwent(3)).</p>

<p>The getspnam() function returns a pointer to a structure
containing the broken-out fields of the record in the shadow
password database that matches the username name.</p>

<p>The getspent() function returns a pointer to the next
entry in the shadow password database. The position in the
input stream is initial- ized by setspent(). When done
reading, the program may call endspent() so that resources
can be deallocated.</p>

<p>The fgetspent() function is similar to getspent() but
uses the supplied stream instead of the one implicitly
opened by setspent().</p>

<p>The sgetspent() function parses the supplied string s
into a struct spwd.</p>

<p>The putspent() function writes the contents of the
supplied struct spwd *p as a text line in the shadow
password file format to the stream fp. String entries with
value NULL and numerical entries with value -1 are written
as an empty string.</p>

<p>The lckpwdf() function is intended to protect against
multiple simulta- neous accesses of the shadow password
database. It tries to acquire a lock, and returns 0 on
success, or -1 on failure (lock not obtained within 15
seconds). The ulckpwdf() function releases the lock again.
Note that there is no protection against direct access of
the shadow password file. Only programs that use lckpwdf()
will notice the lock.</p>

<p>These were the functions that formed the original shadow
API. They are widely available.</p>

<p>Reentrant versions Analogous to the reentrant functions
for the password database, glibc also has reentrant
functions for the shadow password database. The getspnam_r()
function is like getspnam() but stores the retrieved shadow
password structure in the space pointed to by spbuf. This
shadow password structure contains pointers to strings, and
these strings are stored in the buffer buf of size buflen. A
pointer to the result (in case of success) or NULL (in case
no entry was found or an error occurred) is stored in
*spbufp.</p>

<p>The functions getspent_r(), fgetspent_r(), and
sgetspent_r() are simi- larly analogous to their
non-reentrant counterparts.</p>

<p>Some non-glibc systems also have functions with these
names, often with different prototypes.</p>

<p>Structure The shadow password structure is defined in
&lt;shadow.h&gt; as follows:</p>

<p>struct spwd { char *sp_namp; /* Login name */ char
*sp_pwdp; /* Encrypted password */ long sp_lstchg; /* Date
of last change (measured in days since 1 Jan 1970) */ long
sp_min; /* Min # of days between changes */ long sp_max; /*
Max # of days between changes */ long sp_warn; /* # of days
before password expires to warn user to change it */ long
sp_inact; /* # of days after password expires until account
is disabled */ long sp_expire; /* Date when account expires
(measured in days since 1 Jan 1970) */ unsigned long
sp_flag; /* Reserved */ };</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The functions that return a pointer return
NULL if no more entries are available or if an error occurs
during processing. The functions which have int as the
return value return 0 for success and -1 for failure.</p>

<p>For the non-reentrant functions, the return value may
point to static area, and may be overwritten by subsequent
calls to these functions.</p>

<p>The reentrant functions return zero on success. In case
of error, an error number is returned.</p>

<p>ERRORS ERANGE Supplied buffer is too small.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/shadow local shadow password database
file</p>

<p>/etc/.pwd.lock lock file</p>

<p>The include file &lt;paths.h&gt; defines the constant
_PATH_SHADOW to the pathname of the shadow password
file.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO The shadow password database and its
associated API are not specified in POSIX.1-2001. However,
many other systems provide a similar API.</p>
