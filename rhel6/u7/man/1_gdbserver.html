<p>NAME gdbserver - Remote Server for the GNU Debugger</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS gdbserver tty prog [args...]</p>

<p>gdbserver tty --attach PID</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION GDBSERVER is a program that allows you to
run GDB on a different machine than the one which is running
the program being debugged.</p>

<p>Usage (server (target) side):</p>

<p>First, you need to have a copy of the program you want
to debug put onto the target system. The program can be
stripped to save space if needed, as GDBserver doesn t care
about symbols. All symbol handling is taken care of by the
GDB running on the host system.</p>

<p>To use the server, you log on to the target system, and
run the gdb- server program. You must tell it (a) how to
communicate with GDB, (b) the name of your program, and (c)
its arguments. The general syntax is:</p>

<p>target&gt; gdbserver COMM PROGRAM [ARGS ...]</p>

<p>For example, using a serial port, you might say:</p>

<p>target&gt; gdbserver /dev/com1 emacs foo.txt</p>

<p>This tells gdbserver to debug emacs with an argument of
foo.txt, and to communicate with GDB via /dev/com1.
Gdbserver now waits patiently for the host GDB to
communicate with it.</p>

<p>To use a TCP connection, you could say:</p>

<p>target&gt; gdbserver host:2345 emacs foo.txt</p>

<p>This says pretty much the same thing as the last
example, except that we are going to communicate with the
host GDB via TCP. The host:2345 argument means that we are
expecting to see a TCP connection from host to local TCP
port 2345. (Currently, the host part is ignored.) You can
choose any number you want for the port number as long as it
does not conflict with any existing TCP ports on the target
system. This same port number must be used in the host GDBs
target remote command, which will be described shortly. Note
that if you chose a port number that conflicts with another
service, gdbserver will print an error message and exit.</p>

<p>On some targets, gdbserver can also attach to running
programs. This is accomplished via the --attach argument.
The syntax is:</p>

<p>target&gt; gdbserver COMM --attach PID</p>

<p>PID is the process ID of a currently running process. It
isnt neces- sary to point gdbserver at a binary for the
running process.</p>

<p>Usage (host side):</p>

<p>You need an unstripped copy of the target program on
your host system, since GDB needs to examine its symbol
tables and such. Start up GDB as you normally would, with
the target program as the first argument. (You may need to
use the --baud option if the serial line is running at
anything except 9600 baud.) Ie: gdb TARGET-PROG, or gdb
--baud BAUD TARGET-PROG. After that, the only new command
you need to know about is target remote. Its argument is
either a device name (usually a serial device, like
/dev/ttyb), or a HOST:PORT descriptor. For exam- ple:</p>

<p>(gdb) target remote /dev/ttyb</p>

<p>communicates with the server via serial line /dev/ttyb,
and:</p>

<p>(gdb) target remote the-target:2345</p>

<p>communicates via a TCP connection to port 2345 on host
the-target, where you previously started up gdbserver with
the same port number. Note that for TCP connections, you
must start up gdbserver prior to using the target remote
command, otherwise you may get an error that looks something
like Connection refused.</p>

<p>OPTIONS You have to supply the name of the program to
debug and the tty to com- municate on; the remote GDB will
do everything else. Any remaining arguments will be passed
to the program verbatim.</p>
