<p>NAME default.conf - IPA configuration file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS /etc/ipa/default.conf, ~/.ipa/default.conf,
/etc/ipa/server.conf, /etc/ipa/cli.conf</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The default.conf configuration file is used
to set system-wide defaults to be applied when running IPA
clients and servers.</p>

<p>Users may create an optional configuration file in
~/.ipa/default.conf which will be merged into the
system-wide defaults file.</p>

<p>The following files are read, in order:
~/.ipa/default.conf /etc/ipa/&lt;context&gt;.conf
/etc/ipa/default.conf built-in constants</p>

<p>The IPA server does not read ~/.ipa/default.conf.</p>

<p>The first setting wins.</p>

<p>SYNTAX The configuration options are not case sensitive.
The values may be case sensitive, depending on the
option.</p>

<p>Blank lines are ignored. Lines beginning with # are
comments and are ignored.</p>

<p>Valid lines consist of an option name, an equals sign
and a value. Spaces surrounding equals sign are ignored. An
option terminates at the end of a line.</p>

<p>Values should not be quoted, the quotes will not be
stripped.</p>

<p># Wrong - dont include quotes verbose =
&quot;True&quot;</p>

<p># Right - Properly formatted options verbose = True
verbose=True</p>

<p>Options must appear in the section named [global]. There
are no other sections defined or used currently.</p>

<p>Options may be defined that are not used by IPA. Be
careful of mis- spellings, they will not be rejected.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The following options are relevant for the
server:</p>

<p>basedn &lt;base&gt; Specifies the base DN to use when
performing LDAP operations. The base must be in DN format
(dc=example,dc=com).</p>

<p>ca_agent_port &lt;port&gt; Specifies the secure CA agent
port. The default is 9443 for Dog- tag 9, and 8443 for
Dogtag 10.</p>

<p>ca_ee_port &lt;port&gt; Specifies the secure CA end user
port. The default is 9444 for Dogtag 9, and 8443 for Dogtag
10.</p>

<p>ca_host &lt;hostname&gt; Specifies the hostname of the
dogtag CA server. The default is the hostname of the IPA
server.</p>

<p>ca_port &lt;port&gt; Specifies the insecure CA end user
port. The default is 9180 for Dogtag 9, and 8080 for Dogtag
10.</p>

<p>context &lt;context&gt; Specifies the context that IPA
is being executed in. IPA may operate differently depending
on the context. The current defined contexts are cli and
server. Additionally this value is used to load
/etc/ipa/context.conf to provide context-specific
configuration. For example, if you want to always perform
client requests in verbose mode but do not want to have
verbose enabled on the server, add the verbose option to
/etc/ipa/cli.conf.</p>

<p>debug &lt;boolean&gt; When True provides detailed
information. Specifically this set the global log level to
&quot;debug&quot;. Default is False.</p>

<p>dogtag_version &lt;version&gt; Stores the version of
Dogtag. Value 9 is assumed if not speci- fied otherwise.</p>

<p>domain &lt;domain&gt; The domain of the IPA server e.g.
example.com.</p>

<p>enable_ra &lt;boolean&gt; Specifies whether the CA is
acting as an RA agent, such as when dogtag is being used as
the Certificate Authority. This setting only applies to the
IPA server configuration.</p>

<p>fallback &lt;boolean&gt; Specifies whether an IPA client
should attempt to fall back and try other services if the
first connection fails.</p>

<p>host &lt;hostname&gt; Specifies the hostname of the IPA
server. This value is used to construct URL values on the
client and server.</p>

<p>in_server &lt;boolean&gt; Specifies whether requests
should be forwarded to an IPA server or handled locally.
This is used internally by IPA in a similar way as context.
The same IPA framework is used by the ipa com- mand-line
tool and the server. This setting tells the framework
whether it should execute the command as if on the server or
forward it via XML-RPC to a remote server.</p>

<p>in_tree &lt;boolean&gt; This is used in development and
is generally a detected value. It means that the code is
being executed within a source tree.</p>

<p>interactive &lt;boolean&gt; Specifies whether values
should be prompted for or not. The default is True.</p>

<p>ldap_uri &lt;URI&gt; Specifies the URI of the IPA LDAP
server to connect to. The URI scheme may be one of ldap or
ldapi. The default is to use ldapi, e.g.
ldapi://%2fvar%2frun%2fslapd-EXAMPLE-COM.socket</p>

<p>log_logger_XXX &lt;comma separated list of regexps&gt;
loggers matching regexp will be assigned XXX level.</p>

<p>Logger levels can be explicitly specified for specific
loggers as opposed to a global logging level. Specific
loggers are indicated by a list of regular expressions bound
to a level. If a logger s name matches the regexp then it is
assigned that level. This config item must begin with
&quot;log_logger_level_&quot; and then be followed by a
symbolic or numeric log level, for exam- ple:</p>

<p>log_logger_level_debug = ipalib.dn..*</p>

<p>log_logger_level_35 = ipalib.plugins.dogtag</p>

<p>The first line says any logger belonging to the
ipalib.dn module will have its level configured to
debug.</p>

<p>The second line say the ipa.plugins.dogtag logger will
be con- figured to level 35.</p>

<p>This config item is useful when you only want to see the
log output from one or more selected loggers. Turning on the
global debug flag will produce an enormous amount of output.
This allows you to leave the global debug flag off and
selectively enable output from a specific logger. Typically
loggers are bound to classes and plugins.</p>

<p>Note: logger names are a dot (.) separated list forming
a path in the logger tree. The dot character is also a
regular expres- sion metacharacter (matches any character)
therefore you will usually need to escape the dot in the
logger names by preceeding it with a backslash.</p>

<p>mode &lt;mode&gt; Specifies the mode the server is
running in. The currently sup- port values are production
and development. When running in pro- duction mode some
self-tests are skipped to improve performance.</p>

<p>mount_ipa &lt;URI&gt; Specifies the mount point that the
development server will reg- ister. The default is /ipa/</p>

<p>prompt_all &lt;boolean&gt; Specifies that all options
should be prompted for in the IPA client, even optional
values. Default is False.</p>

<p>ra_plugin &lt;name&gt; Specifies the name of the CA back
end to use. The current options are selfsign and dogtag.
This is a server-side setting. Changing this value is not
recommended as the CA back end is only set up during initial
installation.</p>

<p>realm &lt;realm&gt; Specifies the Kerberos realm.</p>

<p>session_auth_duration &lt;time duration spec&gt;
Specifies the length of time authentication credentials
cached in the session are valid. After the duration expires
credentials will be automatically reacquired. Examples are
&quot;2 hours&quot;, &quot;1h:30m&quot;, &quot;10
minutes&quot;, &quot;5min, 30sec&quot;.</p>

<p>session_duration_type
&lt;inactivity_timeout|from_start&gt; Specifies how the
expiration of a session is computed. With inactivity_timeout
the expiration time is advanced by the value of
session_auth_duration everytime the user accesses the ser-
vice. With from_start the session expiration is the start of
the user s session plus the value of
session_auth_duration.</p>

<p>server &lt;hostname&gt; Specifies the IPA Server
hostname. This option is deprecated.</p>

<p>startup_timeout &lt;time in seconds&gt; Controls the
amount of time waited when starting a service. The default
value is 120 seconds.</p>

<p>startup_traceback &lt;boolean&gt; If the IPA server
fails to start and this value is True the server will
attempt to generate a python traceback to make iden- tifying
the underlying problem easier.</p>

<p>validate_api &lt;boolean&gt; Used internally in the IPA
source package to verify that the API has not changed. This
is used to prevent regressions. If it is true then some
errors are ignored so enough of the IPA framework can be
loaded to verify all of the API, even if optional compo-
nents are not installed. The default is False.</p>

<p>verbose &lt;boolean&gt; When True provides more
information. Specifically this sets the global log level to
&quot;info&quot;.</p>

<p>wait_for_attr &lt;boolean&gt; Debug option. Waits for
asynchronous execution of 389-ds postop- eration plugins
before returning data to the client, therefore data added by
postoperation plugins is included in the result. Increases
execution time.</p>

<p>xmlrpc_uri &lt;URI&gt; Specifies the URI of the XML-RPC
server for a client. This is used by IPA and some external
tools as well, such as ipa-getcert. e.g.
https://ipa.example.com/ipa/xml</p>

<p>The following define the containers for the IPA server.
Containers define where in the DIT that objects can be
found. The full location is the value of container + basedn.
container_accounts: cn=accounts container_applications:
cn=applications,cn=configs,cn=policies container_automount:
cn=automount container_configs: cn=configs,cn=policies
container_dns: cn=dns container_entitlements:

<p>FILES /etc/ipa/default.conf system-wide IPA
configuration file</p>

<p>$HOME/.ipa/default.conf user IPA configuration file</p>

<p>It is also possible to define context-specific
configuration files. The context is set when the IPA api is
initialized. The two currently defined contexts in IPA are
cli and server. This is helpful, for exam- ple, if you only
want debug enabled on the server and not in the client. If
this is set to True in default.conf it will affect both the
ipa client tool and the IPA server. If it is only set in
server.conf then only the server will have debug set. These
files will be loaded if they exist:</p>

<p>/etc/ipa/cli.conf system-wide IPA client configuration
file</p>

<p>/etc/ipa/server.conf system-wide IPA server
configuration file</p>
