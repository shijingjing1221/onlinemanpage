<p>RTNETLINK(7) Linux Programmer s Manual RTNETLINK(7)</p>

<p>NAME rtnetlink, NETLINK_ROUTE - Linux IPv4 routing
socket</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;asm/types.h&gt; #include
&lt;linux/netlink.h&gt; #include &lt;linux/rtnetlink.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;</p>

<p>rtnetlink_socket = socket(AF_NETLINK, int socket_type,
NETLINK_ROUTE);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Rtnetlink allows the kernels routing tables
to be read and altered. It is used within the kernel to
communicate between various subsystems, though this usage is
not documented here, and for communication with user-space
programs. Network routes, ip addresses, link parameters,
neighbor setups, queueing disciplines, traffic classes and
packet clas- sifiers may all be controlled through
NETLINK_ROUTE sockets. It is based on netlink messages, see
netlink(7) for more information.</p>

<p>Routing Attributes Some rtnetlink messages have optional
attributes after the initial header:</p>

<p>struct rtattr { unsigned short rta_len; /* Length of
option */ unsigned short rta_type; /* Type of option */ /*
Data follows */ };</p>

<p>These attributes should be only manipulated using the
RTA_* macros or libnetlink, see rtnetlink(3).</p>

<p>Messages Rtnetlink consists of these message types (in
addition to standard netlink messages):</p>

<p>RTM_NEWLINK, RTM_DELLINK, RTM_GETLINK Create, remove or
get information about a specific network interface. These
messages contain an ifinfomsg structure fol- lowed by a
series of rtattr structures.</p>

<p>struct ifinfomsg { unsigned char ifi_family; /*
AF_UNSPEC */ unsigned short ifi_type; /* Device type */ int
ifi_index; /* Interface index */ unsigned int ifi_flags; /*
Device flags */ unsigned int ifi_change; /* change mask */
};</p>

<p>ifi_flags contains the device flags, see netdevice(7);
ifi_index is the unique interface index, ifi_change is
reserved for future use and should be always set to
0xFFFFFFFF.</p>

<p>Routing attributes rta_type value type description
--------------------------------------------------------------
IFLA_UNSPEC - unspecified. IFLA_ADDRESS hardware address
interface L2 address IFLA_BROADCAST hardware address L2
broadcast address. IFLA_IFNAME asciiz string Device
name.</p>

<p>IFLA_MTU unsigned int MTU of the device. IFLA_LINK int
Link type. IFLA_QDISC asciiz string Queueing discipline.
IFLA_STATS see below Interface Statistics.</p>

<p>The value type for IFLA_STATS is struct
net_device_stats.</p>

<p>RTM_NEWADDR, RTM_DELADDR, RTM_GETADDR Add, remove or
receive information about an IP address associ- ated with an
interface. In Linux 2.2 an interface can carry multiple IP
addresses, this replaces the alias device concept in 2.0. In
Linux 2.2 these messages support IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
They contain an ifaddrmsg structure, optionally fol- lowed
by rtaddr routing attributes.</p>

<p>struct ifaddrmsg { unsigned char ifa_family; /* Address
type */ unsigned char ifa_prefixlen; /* Prefixlength of
address */ unsigned char ifa_flags; /* Address flags */
unsigned char ifa_scope; /* Address scope */ int ifa_index;
/* Interface index */ };</p>

<p>ifa_family is the address family type (currently AF_INET
or AF_INET6), ifa_prefixlen is the length of the address
mask of the address if defined for the family (like for
IPv4), ifa_scope is the address scope, ifa_index is the
interface index of the interface the address is associated
with. ifa_flags is a flag word of IFA_F_SECONDARY for
secondary address (old alias inter- face), IFA_F_PERMANENT
for a permanent address set by the user and other
undocumented flags.</p>

<p>Attributes rta_type value type description
-------------------------------------------------------------
IFA_UNSPEC - unspecified. IFA_ADDRESS raw protocol address
interface address IFA_LOCAL raw protocol address local
address IFA_LABEL asciiz string name of the interface
IFA_BROADCAST raw protocol address broadcast address.
IFA_ANYCAST raw protocol address anycast address
IFA_CACHEINFO struct ifa_cacheinfo Address information.</p>

<p>RTM_NEWROUTE, RTM_DELROUTE, RTM_GETROUTE Create, remove
or receive information about a network route. These messages
contain an rtmsg structure with an optional sequence of
rtattr structures following. For RTM_GETROUTE set- ting
rtm_dst_len and rtm_src_len to 0 means you get all entries
for the specified routing table. For the other fields except
rtm_table and rtm_protocol 0 is the wildcard.</p>

<p>struct rtmsg { unsigned char rtm_family; /* Address
family of route */ unsigned char rtm_dst_len; /* Length of
destination */ unsigned char rtm_src_len; /* Length of
source */ unsigned char rtm_tos; /* TOS filter */</p>

<p>unsigned char rtm_table; /* Routing table ID */ unsigned
char rtm_protocol; /* Routing protocol; see below */
unsigned char rtm_scope; /* See below */ unsigned char
rtm_type; /* See below */</p>

<p>unsigned int rtm_flags; };</p>

<p>rtm_type Route type
-----------------------------------------------------------
RTN_UNSPEC unknown route RTN_UNICAST a gateway or direct
route RTN_LOCAL a local interface route RTN_BROADCAST a
local broadcast route (sent as a broadcast) RTN_ANYCAST a
local broadcast route (sent as a uni- cast) RTN_MULTICAST a
multicast route RTN_BLACKHOLE a packet dropping route
RTN_UNREACHABLE an unreachable destination RTN_PROHIBIT a
packet rejection route RTN_THROW continue routing lookup in
another table RTN_NAT a network address translation rule
RTN_XRESOLVE refer to an external resolver (not
implemented)</p>

<p>rtm_protocol Route origin.
--------------------------------------------- RTPROT_UNSPEC
unknown RTPROT_REDIRECT by an ICMP redirect (cur- rently
unused) RTPROT_KERNEL by the kernel RTPROT_BOOT during boot
RTPROT_STATIC by the administrator</p>

<p>Values larger than RTPROT_STATIC are not interpreted by
the ker- nel, they are just for user information. They may
be used to tag the source of a routing information or to
distinguish between multiple routing daemons. See
&lt;linux/rtnetlink.h&gt; for the routing daemon identifiers
which are already assigned.</p>

<p>rtm_scope is the distance to the destination:</p>

<p>RT_SCOPE_UNIVERSE global route RT_SCOPE_SITE interior
route in the local autonomous system RT_SCOPE_LINK route on
this link RT_SCOPE_HOST route on the local host
RT_SCOPE_NOWHERE destination doesnt exist</p>

<p>The values between RT_SCOPE_UNIVERSE and RT_SCOPE_SITE
are available to the user.</p>

<p>The rtm_flags have the following meanings:</p>

<p>RTM_F_NOTIFY if the route changes, notify the user via
rtnetlink RTM_F_CLONED route is cloned from another route
RTM_F_EQUALIZE a multipath equalizer (not yet
implemented)</p>

<p>rtm_table specifies the routing table</p>

<p>RT_TABLE_UNSPEC an unspecified routing table
RT_TABLE_DEFAULT the default table RT_TABLE_MAIN the main
table RT_TABLE_LOCAL the local table</p>

<p>The user may assign arbitrary values between
RT_TABLE_UNSPEC and RT_TABLE_DEFAULT.</p>

<p>Attributes rta_type value type description
--------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<p>RTA_UNSPEC - ignored. RTA_DST protocol address Route
destination address. RTA_SRC protocol address Route source
address. RTA_IIF int Input interface index. RTA_OIF int
Output interface index. RTA_GATEWAY protocol address The
gateway of the route RTA_PRIORITY int Priority of route.
RTA_PREFSRC RTA_METRICS int Route metric RTA_MULTIPATH
RTA_PROTOINFO RTA_FLOW RTA_CACHEINFO</p>

<p>Fill these values in!</p>

<p>RTM_NEWNEIGH, RTM_DELNEIGH, RTM_GETNEIGH Add, remove or
receive information about a neighbor table entry (e.g., an
ARP entry). The message contains an ndmsg structure.</p>

<p>struct ndmsg { unsigned char ndm_family; int
ndm_ifindex; /* Interface index */ __u16 ndm_state; /* State
*/ __u8 ndm_flags; /* Flags */ __u8 ndm_type; };</p>

<p>struct nda_cacheinfo { __u32 ndm_confirmed; __u32
ndm_used; __u32 ndm_updated; __u32 ndm_refcnt; };</p>

<p>ndm_state is a bit mask of the following states:</p>

NUD_REACHABLE a confirmed working cache entry NUD_STALE an
expired cache entry NUD_DELAY an entry waiting for a timer
NUD_PROBE a cache entry that is currently reprobed
NUD_FAILED an invalid cache entry NUD_NOARP a device with no
destination cache NUD_PERMANENT a static entry</p>

<p>Valid ndm_flags are:</p>

<p>NTF_PROXY a proxy arp entry NTF_ROUTER an IPv6
router</p>

<p>The rtaddr struct has the following meanings for the
rta_type field:</p>

<p>NDA_UNSPEC unknown type NDA_DST a neighbor cache n/w
layer destination address NDA_LLADDR a neighbor cache link
layer address NDA_CACHEINFO cache statistics.</p>

<p>If the rta_type field is NDA_CACHEINFO then a struct
nda_cache- info header follows</p>

retrieve a routing rule. Carries a struct rtmsg</p>

<p>RTM_NEWQDISC, RTM_DELQDISC, RTM_GETQDISC Add, remove or
