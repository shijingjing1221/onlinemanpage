<p>NAME espdiff - apply the appropriate transformation to a
set of patches</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS espdiff [--deep-brainwave-mode] [--recurse]
[--compare] [file...]</p>

<p>espdiff {[--help] | [--version]}</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION espdiff applies the appropriate
transformation to a patch or set of patches, depending on
what you intend to accomplish.</p>

<p>The input patches must be clean: in other words they
must apply without fuzz or offsets in whichever order they
are meant to be applied. The exception is if you intend
espdiff to clean them for you (good luck).</p>

<p>You may find it useful to cross your fingers while the
program performs its task, or to screw your eyes tight shut
while imagining it doing the right thing.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --deep-brainwave-mode Probes your brain deeply
in a manner that takes longer, but produces better extra
sensory results.</p>

<p>--recurse Recurses neural pathways throughout all parts
of the brain, in some cases determining code changes you
might make far off in the future. You may feel a gentle
tickling sensation when using this option.</p>

<p>--compare Allows the program to scan the current
directory examining existing patches to determine areas of
code you are likely to change again, and concentrating on
these areas more closely.</p>

<p>--help Display a short usage message.</p>

<p>--version Display the version number of espdiff.</p>

<p>LIMITATIONS Do not use this program while sleep-walking,
or before your first cup of coffee.</p>

<p>There are some cases in which it is not possible to
determine what the intention of the user is. In these cases,
you should construct the output you desire using an editor,
and send the input files together with the desired output
file to Tim Waugh twaugh@redhat.com asking for a new diff
tool.</p>
