SB_START_PAGEFAULT(9)</p>

<p>NAME sb_start_pagefault - get write access to a
superblock from a page fault</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS void sb_start_pagefault(struct super_block *
sb);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS sb the super we write to</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION When a process starts handling write page
fault, it should embed the operation into sb_start_pagefault
- sb_end_pagefault pair to get exclusion against file system
freezing. This is needed since the page fault is going to
dirty a page. This function increments number of running
page faults preventing freezing. If the file system is
already frozen, the function waits until the file system is
thawed.</p>

<p>Since page fault freeze protection behaves as a lock,
users have to preserve ordering of freeze protection and
other filesystem locks. It is advised to put
sb_start_pagefault close to mmap_sem in lock ordering. Page
fault</p>

<p>HANDLING CODE IMPLIES LOCK DEPENDENCY mmap_sem -&gt;
sb_start_pagefault</p>
