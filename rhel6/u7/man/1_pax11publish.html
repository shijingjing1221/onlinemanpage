<p>NAME pax11publish - PulseAudio X11 Credential
Utility</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pax11publish -h</p>

<p>pax11publish [options] [-d]</p>

<p>pax11publish [options] -e</p>

<p>pax11publish [options] -i</p>

<p>pax11publish [options] -r</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pax11publish utility can be used to dump
or manipulate the PulseAu- dio server credentials that can
be stored as properties on the X11 root window.</p>

<p>Please note that the loadable module module-x11-publish
exports the same information directly from the PulseAudio
sound server, and should in most cases be used in preference
over this tool.</p>

<p>Use the following command to dump the raw
PulseAudio-specific data that is stored in your X11 root
window:</p>

<p>xprop -root | grep ^PULSE_</p>

<p>OPTIONS -h Show help.</p>

<p>-d Read the PulseAudio server credentials currently set
on the X11 root window and dump them in a human readable
form. This reads the PULSE_SERVER, PULSE_SINK, PULSE_SOURCE
and PULSE_COOKIE properties.</p>

<p>-i Similar to -d, however dumps them in a Bourne shell
compatible format so they may be used together with the eval
shell command to set the $PULSE_SERVER, $PULSE_SINK,
$PULSE_SOURCE environment variables. Also reads the
authentication cookie from the root window and stores it in
~/.pulse-cookie.</p>

<p>-e Export the currently locally used sound server, sink,
source configuration to the X11 root window. This takes the
data from the $PULSE_SERVER, $PULSE_SINK, $PULSE_SOURCE
environment vari- ables and combines them with the data from
~/.pulse/client.conf (or /etc/pulse/client.conf if that file
does not exist). If spe- cific options are passed on the
command line (-S, -O, -I, -c, see below), they take
precedence. Also uploads the local authen- tication cookie
~/.pulse-cookie to the X11 server.</p>

<p>-r Removes the configured PulseAudio configuration from
the X11 root window.</p>

<p>-D DISPLAY Connect to the specified X11 display, instead
of the default one configured in $DISPLAY.</p>

<p>-S SERVER Only valid for -e: export the specified
PulseAudio server as default to the X11 display instead of
the one configured via local configuration.</p>

<p>-O SINK Only valid for -e: export the specified sink as
default sink to the X11 display instead of the one
configured via local configu- ration.</p>

<p>-I SOURCE Only valid for -e: export the specified source
as default to the X11 display instead of the one configured
via local configura- tion.</p>

<p>-c FILE Only valid for -e: export the PulseAudio
authentication cookie stored in the specified file to the
X11 display instead of the one stored in
~/.pulse-cookie.</p>
