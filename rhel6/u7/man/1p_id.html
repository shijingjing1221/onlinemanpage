<p>ID(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual ID(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME id - return user identity</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS id [user]</p>

<p>id -G[-n] [user]</p>

<p>id -g[-nr] [user]</p>

<p>id -u[-nr] [user]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION If no user operand is provided, the id
utility shall write the user and group IDs and the
corresponding user and group names of the invoking process
to standard output. If the effective and real IDs do not
match, both shall be written. If multiple groups are
supported by the underly- ing system (see the description of
{NGROUPS_MAX} in the System Inter- faces volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001), the supplementary group affilia- tions of the
invoking process shall also be written.</p>

<p>If a user operand is provided and the process has the
appropriate priv- ileges, the user and group IDs of the
selected user shall be written. In this case, effective IDs
shall be assumed to be identical to real IDs. If the
selected user has more than one allowable group membership
listed in the group database, these shall be written in the
same manner as the supplementary groups described in the
preceding paragraph.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The id utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>The following options shall be supported:</p>

<p>-G Output all different group IDs (effective, real, and
supplemen- tary) only, using the format &quot;%n&quot; . If
there is more than one distinct group affiliation, output
each such affiliation, using the format &quot; %u&quot;,
before the &lt;newline&gt; is output.</p>

<p>-g Output only the effective group ID, using the format
&quot;%n&quot; .</p>

<p>-n Output the name in the format &quot;%s&quot; instead
of the numeric ID using the format &quot;%u&quot; .</p>

<p>-r Output the real ID instead of the effective ID.</p>

<p>-u Output only the effective user ID, using the format
&quot;%n&quot; .</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p>user The login name for which information is to be
written.</p>

<p>STDIN Not used.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of id:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in
arguments).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error and informative messages written
to standard output.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT The following formats shall be used when the
LC_MESSAGES locale cate- gory specifies the POSIX locale. In
other locales, the strings uid, gid, euid, egid, and groups
may be replaced with more appropriate strings corresponding
to the locale.</p>

<p>&quot;uid=%u(%s) gid=%u(%sn&quot;, &lt;real user ID&gt;,
&lt;user-name&gt;, &lt;real group ID&gt;,
&lt;group-name&gt;</p>

<p>If the effective and real user IDs do not match, the
following shall be inserted immediately before thncharacter
in the previous format:</p>

<p>&quot; euid=%u(%s)&quot;</p>

<p>with the following arguments added at the end of the
argument list:</p>

<p>&lt;effective user ID&gt;, &lt;effective
user-name&gt;</p>

<p>If the effective and real group IDs do not match, the
following shall be inserted directly before thncharacter in
the format string (and after any addition resulting from the
effective and real user IDs not matching):</p>

<p>&quot; egid=%u(%s)&quot;</p>

<p>with the following arguments added at the end of the
argument list:</p>

<p>&lt;effective group-ID&gt;, &lt;effective group
name&gt;</p>

<p>If the process has supplementary group affiliations or
the selected user is allowed to belong to multiple groups,
the first shall be added directly before the &lt;newline&gt;
in the format string:</p>

<p>&quot; groups=%u(%s)&quot;</p>

<p>with the following arguments added at the end of the
argument list:</p>

<p>&lt;supplementary group ID&gt;, &lt;supplementary group
name&gt;</p>

<p>and the necessary number of the following added after
that for any remaining supplementary group IDs:</p>

<p>&quot;,%u(%s)&quot;</p>

<p>and the necessary number of the following arguments
added at the end of the argument list:</p>

<p>&lt;supplementary group ID&gt;, &lt;supplementary group
name&gt;</p>

<p>If any of the user ID, group ID, effective user ID,
effective group ID, or supplementary/multiple group IDs
cannot be mapped by the system into printable user or group
names, the corresponding &quot;(%s)&quot; and name argu-
ment shall be omitted from the corresponding format
string.</p>

<p>When any of the options are specified, the output format
shall be as described in the OPTIONS section.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 Successful completion.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE Output produced by the -G option and
by the default case could poten- tially produce very long
lines on systems that support large numbers of supplementary
groups. (On systems with user and group IDs that are 32-bit
integers and with group names with a maximum of 8 bytes per
name, 93 supplementary groups plus distinct effective and
real group and user IDs could theoretically overflow the
2048-byte {LINE_MAX} text file line limit on the default
output case. It would take about 186 supplementary groups to
overflow the 2048-byte barrier using id -G). This is not
expected to be a problem in practice, but in cases where it
is a concern, applications should consider using fold -s
before post- processing the output of id.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The functionality provided by the 4 BSD groups
utility can be simulated using:</p>

<p>id -Gn [ user ]</p>

<p>The 4 BSD command groups was considered, but it was not
included because it did not provide the functionality of the
id utility of the SVID. Also, it was thought that it would
be easier to modify id to pro- vide the additional
functionality necessary to systems with multiple groups than
to invent another command.</p>

<p>The options -u, -g, -n, and -r were added to ease the
use of id with shell commands substitution. Without these
options it is necessary to use some preprocessor such as sed
to select the desired piece of infor- mation. Since output
such as that produced by:</p>

<p>id -u -n</p>

<p>is frequently wanted, it seemed desirable to add the
options.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
