<p>NAME gnome-wm - Launches the user selected window
manager for the GNOME ses- sion</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS gnome-wm [--default-wm windowmanager]
[--sm-client-id id]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The gnome-wm script invokes the user
selected window manager. If the user has not chosen a window
manager it will launch a GNOME compliant window manager.</p>

<p>The user can overwrite the selection of a window manager
by setting the WINDOW_MANAGER environment variable. If a
--default-wm option is given the script uses that window
manager in case WINDOW_MANAGER is not set.</p>

<p>The script takes the --sm-client-id option and
translates the id to an appropriate option depending on
which window manager was selected.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT The gnome-wm program uses the value of the
WINDOW_MANAGER environment variable to let the user override
the configured window manager.</p>
