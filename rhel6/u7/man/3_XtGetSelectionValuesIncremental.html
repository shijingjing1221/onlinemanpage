<p>XtGetSelectionValueIncremental(3)XT
FUNCTIONSXtGetSelectionValueIncremental(3)</p>

<p>NAME XtGetSelectionValueIncremental,
XtGetSelectionValuesIncremental - obtain selection
values</p>

<p>SYNTAX void XtGetSelectionValueIncremental(Widget w,
Atom selection, Atom tar- get, XtSelectionCallbackProc
callback, XtPointer client_data, Time time);</p>

<p>void XtGetSelectionValuesIncremental(Widget w, Atom
selection, Atom *targets, int count, XtSelectionCallbackProc
callback, XtPointer client_data, Time time);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS callback Specifies the callback procedure that
is to be called when the selection value has been
obtained.</p>

<p>client_data Specifies the argument that is to be passed
to the specified procedure when it is called.</p>

<p>client_data Specifies the client data (one for each
target type) that is passed to the callback procedure when
it is called for that target.</p>

<p>count Specifies the length of the targets and
client_data lists.</p>

<p>selection Specifies the particular selection desired
(that is, primary or secondary).</p>

<p>target Specifies the type of the information that is
needed about the selection.</p>

<p>targets Specifies the types of information that is
needed about the selection.</p>

<p>time Specifies the timestamp that indicates when the
selection value is desired.</p>

<p>w Specifies the widget that is making the request.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The XtGetSelectionValueIncremental function
is similar to XtGetSelec- tionValue except that the
selection_callback procedure will be called repeatedly upon
delivery of multiple segments of the selection value. The
end of the selection value is indicated when
selection_callback is called with a non-NULL value of length
zero, which must still be freed by the client. If the
transfer of the selection is aborted in the mid- dle of a
transfer (for example, because to timeout), the selec-
tion_callback procedure is called with a type value equal to
the sym- bolic constant XT_CONVERT_FAIL so that the
requestor can dispose of the partial selection value it has
collected up until that point. Upon receiving
XT_CONVERT_FAIL, the requesting client must determine for
itself whether or not a partially completed transfer is
meaningful.</p>

<p>The XtGetSelectionValuesIncremental function is similar
to XtGet- SelectionValueIncremental except that it takes a
list of target types and a list of client data and obtains
the current value of the selec- tion converted to each of
the targets. The effect is as if each target were specified
in a separate call to XtGetSelectionValueIncremental. The
callback is called once with the corresponding client data
for each target. XtGetSelectionValuesIncremental does
guarantee that all the conversions will use the same
selection value because the ownership of the selection
cannot change in the middle of the list, as would be when
calling XtGetSelectionValueIncremental repeatedly.</p>
