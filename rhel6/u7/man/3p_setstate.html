<p>INITSTATE(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
INITSTATE(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME initstate, random, setstate, srandom -
pseudo-random number functions</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</p>

<p>char *initstate(unsigned seed, char *state, size_t
size); long random(void); char *setstate(const char *state);
void srandom(unsigned seed);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The random() function shall use a non-linear
additive feedback random- number generator employing a
default state array size of 31 long inte- gers to return
successive pseudo-random numbers in the range from 0 to
2**31-1. The period of this random-number generator is
approximately 16 x (2**31-1). The size of the state array
determines the period of the random-number generator.
Increasing the state array size shall increase the
period.</p>

<p>With 256 bytes of state information, the period of the
random-number generator shall be greater than 2**69.</p>

<p>Like rand(), random() shall produce by default a
sequence of numbers that can be duplicated by calling
srandom() with 1 as the seed.</p>

<p>The srandom() function shall initialize the current
state array using the value of seed.</p>

<p>The initstate() and setstate() functions handle
restarting and changing random-number generators. The
initstate() function allows a state array, pointed to by the
state argument, to be initialized for future use. The size
argument, which specifies the size in bytes of the state
array, shall be used by initstate() to decide what type of
random-num- ber generator to use; the larger the state
array, the more random the numbers. Values for the amount of
state information are 8, 32, 64, 128, and 256 bytes. Other
values greater than 8 bytes are rounded down to the nearest
one of these values. If initstate() is called with
8&lt;=size&lt;32, then random() shall use a simple linear
congruential random number generator. The seed argument
specifies a starting point for the random-number sequence
and provides for restarting at the same point. The
initstate() function shall return a pointer to the previous
state information array.</p>

<p>If initstate() has not been called, then random() shall
behave as though initstate() had been called with seed=1 and
size=128.</p>

<p>Once a state has been initialized, setstate() allows
switching between state arrays. The array defined by the
state argument shall be used for further random-number
generation until initstate() is called or set- state() is
called again. The setstate() function shall return a pointer
to the previous state array.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE If initstate() is called with size less
than 8, it shall return NULL.</p>

<p>The random() function shall return the generated
pseudo-random number.</p>

<p>The srandom() function shall not return a value.</p>

<p>Upon successful completion, initstate() and setstate()
shall return a pointer to the previous state array;
otherwise, a null pointer shall be returned.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE After initialization, a state array
can be restarted at a different point in one of two
ways:</p>

<p>1. The initstate() function can be used, with the
desired seed, state array, and size of the array.</p>

<p>2. The setstate() function, with the desired state, can
be used, fol- lowed by srandom() with the desired seed. The
advantage of using both of these functions is that the size
of the state array does not have to be saved once it is
initialized.</p>

<p>Although some implementations of random() have written
messages to standard error, such implementations do not
conform to IEEE Std 1003.1-2001.</p>

<p>Issue 5 restored the historical behavior of this
function.</p>

<p>Threaded applications should use erand48(), nrand48(),
or jrand48() instead of random() when an independent random
number sequence in mul- tiple threads is required.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
