<p>NAME lmhosts - The Samba NetBIOS hosts file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS lmhosts is the samba(7) NetBIOS name to IP
address mapping file.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This file is part of the samba(7) suite.</p>

<p>lmhosts is the Samba NetBIOS name to IP address mapping
file. It is very similar to the /etc/hosts file format,
except that the hostname component must correspond to the
NetBIOS naming format.</p>

<p>FILE FORMAT It is an ASCII file containing one line for
NetBIOS name. The two fields on each line are separated from
each other by white space. Any entry beginning with
&rsquo;#&rsquo; is ignored. Each line in the lmhosts file
contains the following information:</p>

<p>&middot; IP Address - in dotted decimal format.</p>

<p>&middot; NetBIOS Name - This name format is a maximum
fifteen character host name, with an optional trailing
&rsquo;#&rsquo; character followed by the NetBIOS name type
as two hexadecimal digits.</p>

<p>If the trailing &rsquo;#&rsquo; is omitted then the
given IP address will be returned for all names that match
the given name, whatever the NetBIOS name type in the
lookup.</p>

<p>An example follows:</p>

<p># # Sample Samba lmhosts file. # 192.9.200.1 TESTPC
192.9.200.20 NTSERVER#20 192.9.200.21 SAMBASERVER</p>

<p>Contains three IP to NetBIOS name mappings. The first
and third will be returned for any queries for the names
&quot;TESTPC&quot; and &quot;SAMBASERVER&quot; respectively,
whatever the type component of the NetBIOS name
requested.</p>

<p>The second mapping will be returned only when the
&quot;0x20&quot; name type for a name &quot;NTSERVER&quot;
is queried. Any other name type will not be resolved.</p>

<p>The default location of the lmhosts file is in the same
directory as the smb.conf(5) file.</p>

<p>FILES lmhosts is loaded from the configuration
directory. This is usually /etc/samba or
/usr/local/samba/lib.</p>

<p>VERSION This man page is correct for version 3 of the
Samba suite.</p>

<p>AUTHOR The original Samba software and related utilities
were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by
the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way
the Linux kernel is developed.</p>

<p>The original Samba man pages were written by Karl Auer.
The man page sources were converted to YODL format (another
excellent piece of Open Source software, available at
ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/) and updated for the Samba
2.0 release by Jeremy Allison. The conversion to DocBook for
Samba 2.2 was done by Gerald Carter. The conversion to
DocBook XML 4.2 was done by Alexander Bokovoy.</p>
