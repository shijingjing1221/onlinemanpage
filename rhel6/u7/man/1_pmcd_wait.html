<p>PMCD_WAIT(1) PMCD_WAIT(1)</p>

<p>NAME pmcd_wait - wait for PMCD to accept client
connections</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS $PCP_BINADM_DIR/pmcd_wait [-h host] [-t
interval] [-v]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pmcd_wait waits for the Performance Metrics
Collector Daemon (PMCD) to be running and accepting client
connections.</p>

<p>Unless directed to another host by the -h option,
pmcd_wait will try to contact pmcd(1) on the local host.</p>

<p>pmcd_wait will timeout and abandon the attempt to
connect to pmcd after 60 seconds. This default timeout
interval may be changed using the -t option, where the
interval argument follows the syntax described in
PCPIntro(1) and in the simplest form may be an unsigned
integer (the implied units in this case are seconds).</p>

<p>On successful connection to pmcd an exit status of zero
is returned.</p>

<p>If an error or timeout occurs, then a non-zero exit
status is returned as described below.</p>

<p>The other options are as follows:</p>

<p>-v This option turns the verbose mode on. With the
verbose mode off (which is the default), no output will be
generated. With verbose mode on, error messages will be
output on stderr.</p>

<p>PCP ENVIRONMENT Environment variables with the prefix
PCP_ are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP. On each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in pcp.conf(5).</p>

<p>SEE ALSO PCPIntro(1), pmcd(1), pcp.conf(5) and
pcp.env(5).</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS Error messages will be output to stderr only
if the verbose mode is on.</p>

<p>The following exit status codes are returned:</p>

<p>0 pmcd_wait was able to successfully connect to pmcd
within the timeout period.</p>

<p>1 A usage error occurred, use -v for more details.</p>

<p>2 No connection was made in the timeout interval. This
will hap- pen if pmcd is running but takes too long to
complete the client connection, or if pmcd is not running
and all connection attempts in the timeout interval failed
with the error ECONNRE- FUSED.</p>

<p>3 A UNIX error occurred, use -v for more details.</p>

<p>4 A PCP error occurred, use -v for more details.</p>
