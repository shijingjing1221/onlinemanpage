<p>NAME regexp - Match a regular expression against a
string</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS regexp ?switches? exp string ?matchVar?
?subMatchVar subMatchVar ...?
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Determines whether the regular expression
exp matches part or all of string and returns 1 if it does,
0 if it does not, unless -inline is specified (see below).
(Regular expression matching is described in the re_syntax
reference page.)</p>

<p>If additional arguments are specified after string then
they are treated as the names of variables in which to
return information about which part(s) of string matched
exp. MatchVar will be set to the range of string that
matched all of exp. The first subMatchVar will contain the
characters in string that matched the leftmost parenthesized
subex- pression within exp, the next subMatchVar will
contain the characters that matched the next parenthesized
subexpression to the right in exp, and so on.</p>

<p>If the initial arguments to regexp start with - then
they are treated as switches. The following switches are
currently supported:</p>

<p>-about Instead of attempting to match the regular
expression, returns a list containing information about the
regular expression. The first element of the list is a
subex- pression count. The second element is a list of prop-
erty names that describe various attributes of the regu- lar
expression. This switch is primarily intended for debugging
purposes.</p>

<p>-expanded Enables use of the expanded regular expression
syntax where whitespace and comments are ignored. This is
the same as specifying the (?x) embedded option (see the
re_syntax manual page).</p>

<p>-indices Changes what is stored in the subMatchVars.
Instead of storing the matching characters from string, each
vari- able will contain a list of two decimal strings giving
the indices in string of the first and last characters in
the matching range of characters.</p>

<p>-line Enables newline-sensitive matching. By default,
newline is a completely ordinary character with no special
mean- ing. With this flag, [^ bracket expressions and .
never match newline, ^ matches an empty string after any
newline in addition to its normal function, and $ matches an
empty string before any newline in addition to its normal
function. This flag is equivalent to specifying both
-linestop and -lineanchor, or the (?n) embedded option (see
the re_syntax manual page).</p>

<p>-linestop Changes the behavior of [^ bracket expressions
and . so that they stop at newlines. This is the same as
specifying the (?p) embedded option (see the re_syntax
manual page).</p>

<p>-lineanchor Changes the behavior of ^ and $ (the
anchors) so they match the beginning and end of a line
respectively. This is the same as specifying the (?w)
embedded option (see the re_syntax manual page).</p>

<p>-nocase Causes upper-case characters in string to be
treated as lower case during the matching process.</p>

<p>-all Causes the regular expression to be matched as many
times as possible in the string, returning the total number
of matches found. If this is specified with match variables,
they will contain information for the last match only.</p>

<p>-inline Causes the command to return, as a list, the
data that would otherwise be placed in match variables. When
using -inline, match variables may not be specified. If used
with -all, the list will be concatenated at each iteration,
such that a flat list is always returned. For each match
iteration, the command will append the overall match data,
plus one element for each subexpres- sion in the regular
expression. Examples are: regexp -inline -- {72 _in n regexp
-all -inline -- {72 _in n li i ne e</p>

<p>-start index Specifies a character index offset into the
string to start matching the regular expression at. The
index value is interpreted in the same manner as the index
argument to string index. When using this switch, ^ will not
match the beginning of the line, and 1 still match the start
of the string at index. If -indices is specified, the
indices will be indexed starting from the absolute beginning
of the input string. index will be constrained to the bounds
of the input string.</p>

<p>-- Marks the end of switches. The argument following
this one will be treated as exp even if it starts with a
-.</p>

<p>If there are more subMatchVars than parenthesized
subexpressions within exp, or if a particular subexpression
in exp does not match the string (e.g. because it was in a
portion of the expression that was not matched), then the
corresponding subMatchVar will be set to -1 -1 if -indices
has been specified or to an empty string otherwise.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Find the first occurrence of a word starting
with foo in a string that is not actually an instance of
foobar, and get the letters following it up to the end of
the word into a variable: regexp {oo(?!bar(576 Note that the
whole matched substring has been placed in the variable
-&gt;, which is a name chosen to look nice given that we are
not actu- ally interested in its contents.</p>

<p>Find the index of the word badger (in any case) within a
string and store that in the variable location: regexp
-indices {(?i)adger $string location This could also be
written as a basic regular expression (as opposed to using
the default syntax of advanced regular expressions) match by
pre- fixing the expression with a suitable flag: regexp
-indices {(?ib)&lt;badger&gt;} $string location</p>

<p>This counts the number of octal digits in a string:
regexp -all {[0-7]} $string</p>

<p>This lists all words (consisting of all sequences of
non-whitespace characters) in a string, and is useful as a
more powerful version of the split command: regexp -all
-inline {} $string</p>
