<p>ISWGRAPH(3) Linux Programmer s Manual ISWGRAPH(3)</p>

<p>NAME iswgraph - test for graphic wide character</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;wctype.h&gt;</p>

<p>int iswgraph(wint_t wc);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The iswgraph() function is the
wide-character equivalent of the isgraph(3) function. It
tests whether wc is a wide character belonging to the
wide-character class &quot;graph&quot;.</p>

<p>The wide-character class &quot;graph&quot; is a subclass
of the wide-character class &quot;print&quot;.</p>

<p>Being a subclass of the wide-character class
&quot;print&quot;, the wide-charac- ter class
&quot;graph&quot; is disjoint from the wide-character class
&quot;cntrl&quot;.</p>

<p>The wide-character class &quot;graph&quot; is disjoint
from the wide-character class &quot;space&quot; and
therefore also disjoint from its subclass
&quot;blank&quot;.</p>

<p>The wide-character class &quot;graph&quot; contains all
the wide characters from the wide-character class
&quot;print&quot; except the space character. It there- fore
contains the wide-character classes &quot;alnum&quot; and
&quot;punct&quot;.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The iswgraph() function returns non-zero if
wc is a wide character belonging to the wide-character class
&quot;graph&quot;. Otherwise it returns zero.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO C99.</p>

<p>NOTES The behavior of iswgraph() depends on the LC_CTYPE
category of the cur- rent locale.</p>
