<p>CONSTANTS IEEE80211_HW_HAS_RATE_CONTROL The hardware or
firmware includes rate control, and cannot be controlled by
the stack. As such, no rate control algorithm should be
instantiated, and the TX rate reported to userspace will be
taken from the TX status instead of the rate control
algorithm. Note that this requires that the driver implement
a number of callbacks so it has the correct information, it
needs to have the set_rts_threshold callback and must look
at the BSS config use_cts_prot for G/N protection,
use_short_slot for slot timing in 2.4 GHz and
use_short_preamble for preambles for CCK frames.</p>

<p>IEEE80211_HW_RX_INCLUDES_FCS Indicates that received
frames passed to the stack include the FCS at the end.</p>

<p>IEEE80211_HW_HOST_BROADCAST_PS_BUFFERING Some wireless
LAN chipsets buffer broadcast/multicast frames for power
saving stations in the hardware/firmware and others rely on
the host system for such buffering. This option is used to
configure the IEEE 802.11 upper layer to buffer broadcast
and multicast frames when there are power saving stations so
that the driver can fetch them with
ieee80211_get_buffered_bc.</p>

<p>IEEE80211_HW_2GHZ_SHORT_SLOT_INCAPABLE Hardware is not
capable of short slot operation on the 2.4 GHz band.</p>

<p>IEEE80211_HW_2GHZ_SHORT_PREAMBLE_INCAPABLE Hardware is
not capable of receiving frames with short preamble on the
2.4 GHz band.</p>

<p>IEEE80211_HW_SIGNAL_UNSPEC Hardware can provide signal
values but we don&acute;t know its units. We expect values
between 0 and max_signal. If possible please provide dB or
dBm instead.</p>

<p>IEEE80211_HW_SIGNAL_DBM Hardware gives signal values in
dBm, decibel difference from one milliwatt. This is the
preferred method since it is standardized between different
devices. max_signal does not need to be set.</p>

<p>IEEE80211_HW_NEED_DTIM_BEFORE_ASSOC This device needs to
get data from beacon before association (i.e.
dtim_period).</p>

<p>IEEE80211_HW_SPECTRUM_MGMT Hardware supports spectrum
management defined in 802.11h Measurement, Channel Switch,
Quieting, TPC</p>

<p>IEEE80211_HW_AMPDU_AGGREGATION Hardware supports 11n
A-MPDU aggregation.</p>

<p>IEEE80211_HW_SUPPORTS_PS Hardware has power save support
(i.e. can go to sleep).</p>

<p>IEEE80211_HW_PS_NULLFUNC_STACK Hardware requires
nullfunc frame handling in stack, implies stack support for
dynamic PS.</p>

<p>IEEE80211_HW_SUPPORTS_DYNAMIC_PS Hardware has support
for dynamic PS.</p>

<p>IEEE80211_HW_MFP_CAPABLE Hardware supports management
frame protection (MFP, IEEE 802.11w).</p>

<p>IEEE80211_HW_WANT_MONITOR_VIF The driver would like to
be informed of a virtual monitor interface when monitor
interfaces are the only active interfaces.</p>

<p>IEEE80211_HW_NO_AUTO_VIF The driver would like for no
wlanX to be created. It is expected user-space will create
vifs as desired (and thus have them named as desired).</p>

<p>IEEE80211_HW_REPORTS_TX_ACK_STATUS Hardware can provide
ack status reports of Tx frames to the stack.</p>

<p>IEEE80211_HW_CONNECTION_MONITOR The hardware performs
its own connection monitoring, including periodic
keep-alives to the AP and probing the AP on beacon loss.</p>

<p>IEEE80211_HW_QUEUE_CONTROL The driver wants to control
per-interface queue mapping in order to use different queues
(not just one per AC) for different virtual interfaces. See
the doc section on HW queue control for more details.</p>

<p>IEEE80211_HW_SUPPORTS_PER_STA_GTK The device&acute;s
crypto engine supports per-station GTKs as used by IBSS RSN
or during fast transition. If the device doesn&acute;t
support per-station GTKs, but can be asked not to decrypt
group addressed frames, then IBSS RSN support is still
possible but software crypto will be used. Advertise the
wiphy flag only in that case.</p>

<p>IEEE80211_HW_AP_LINK_PS When operating in AP mode the
device autonomously manages the PS status of connected
stations. When this flag is set mac80211 will not trigger PS
mode for connected stations based on the PM bit of incoming
frames. Use ieee80211_start_ps/ieee8021_end_ps to manually
configure the PS mode of connected stations.</p>

<p>IEEE80211_HW_TX_AMPDU_SETUP_IN_HW The device handles TX
A-MPDU session setup strictly in HW. mac80211 should not
attempt to do this in software.</p>

<p>IEEE80211_HW_SUPPORTS_RC_TABLE The driver supports using
a rate selection table provided by the rate control
algorithm.</p>

<p>IEEE80211_HW_P2P_DEV_ADDR_FOR_INTF Use the P2P Device
address for any P2P Interface. This will be honoured even if
more than one interface is supported.</p>

<p>IEEE80211_HW_TIMING_BEACON_ONLY Use sync timing from
beacon frames only, to allow getting TBTT of a DTIM
beacon.</p>

<p>IEEE80211_HW_SUPPORTS_HT_CCK_RATES Hardware supports
mixing HT/CCK rates and can cope with CCK rates in an
aggregation session (e.g. by not using aggregation for such
frames.)</p>

<p>IEEE80211_HW_CHANCTX_STA_CSA Support 802.11h based
channel-switch (CSA) for a single active channel while using
channel contexts. When support is not enabled the default
action is to disconnect when getting the CSA frame.</p>

<p>IEEE80211_HW_SUPPORTS_CLONED_SKBS The driver will never
modify the payload or tailroom of TX skbs without copying
them first.</p>

<p>IEEE80211_SINGLE_HW_SCAN_ON_ALL_BANDS The HW supports
scanning on all bands in one command, mac80211 doesn&acute;t
have to run separate scans per band.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION These flags are used to indicate hardware
capabilities to the stack. Generally, flags here should have
their meaning done in a way that the simplest hardware
doesn&acute;t need setting any particular flags. There are
some exceptions to this rule, however, so you are advised to
review these flags carefully.</p>
