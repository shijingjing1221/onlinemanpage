<p>PTHREAD_MUTEXATTR_GETPSHAREPOSIX Programmer s
PTHREAD_MUTEXATTR_GETPSHARED(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME pthread_mutexattr_getpshared,
pthread_mutexattr_setpshared - get and set the
process-shared attribute</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;</p>

<p>int pthread_mutexattr_getpshared(const
pthread_mutexattr_t * restrict attr, int *restrict pshared);
int pthread_mutexattr_setpshared(pthread_mutexattr_t *attr,
int pshared);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pthread_mutexattr_getpshared() function
shall obtain the value of the process-shared attribute from
the attributes object referenced by attr. The
pthread_mutexattr_setpshared() function shall set the pro-
cess-shared attribute in an initialized attributes object
referenced by attr.</p>

<p>The process-shared attribute is set to
PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED to permit a mutex to be operated upon
by any thread that has access to the memory where the mutex
is allocated, even if the mutex is allocated in memory that
is shared by multiple processes. If the process-shared
attribute is PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE, the mutex shall only
be operated upon by threads created within the same process
as the thread that initialized the mutex; if threads of
differing processes attempt to operate on such a mutex, the
behavior is undefined. The default value of the attribute
shall be PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion,
pthread_mutexattr_setpshared() shall return zero; otherwise,
an error number shall be returned to indicate the error.</p>

<p>Upon successful completion,
pthread_mutexattr_getpshared() shall return zero and store
the value of the process-shared attribute of attr into the
object referenced by the pshared parameter. Otherwise, an
error number shall be returned to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The pthread_mutexattr_getpshared() and
pthread_mutexattr_setpshared() functions may fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The value specified by attr is invalid.</p>

<p>The pthread_mutexattr_setpshared() function may fail
if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The new value specified for the attribute is
outside the range of legal values for that attribute.</p>

<p>These functions shall not return an error code of
[EINTR].</p>
