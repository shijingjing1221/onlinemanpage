<p>UUID_TIME(3) Libuuid API UUID_TIME(3)</p>

<p>NAME uuid_time - extract the time at which the UUID was
created</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;uuid/uuid.h&gt;</p>

<p>time_t uuid_time(uuid_t uu, struct timeval *ret_tv)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The uuid_time function extracts the time at
which the supplied time- based UUID uu was created. Note
that the UUID creation time is only encoded within certain
types of UUIDs. This function can only reason- ably expect
to extract the creation time for UUIDs created with the
uuid_generate_time(3) and uuid_generate_time_safe(3)
functions. It may or may not work with UUIDs created by
other mechanisms.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUES The time at which the UUID was created, in
seconds since January 1, 1970 GMT (the epoch), is returned
(see time(2)). The time at which the UUID was created, in
seconds and microseconds since the epoch, is also stored in
the location pointed to by ret_tv (see gettimeofday(2)).</p>
