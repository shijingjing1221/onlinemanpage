<p>RECVMMSG(2) Linux Programmer s Manual RECVMMSG(2)</p>

<p>NAME recvmmsg - receive multiple messages on a
socket</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #define _GNU_SOURCE #include
&lt;sys/socket.h&gt;</p>

<p>int recvmmsg(int sockfd, struct mmsghdr *msgvec,
unsigned int vlen, unsigned int flags, struct timespec
*timeout);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The recvmmsg() system call is an extension
of recvmsg(2) that allows the caller to receive multiple
messages from a socket using a single system call. (This has
performance benefits for some applications.) A further
extension over recvmsg(2) is support for a timeout on the
receive operation.</p>

<p>The sockfd argument is the file descriptor of the socket
to receive data from.</p>

<p>The msgvec argument is a pointer to an array of mmsghdr
structures. The size of this array is specified in vlen.</p>

<p>The mmsghdr structure is defined in &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;
as:</p>

<p>struct mmsghdr { struct msghdr msg_hdr; /* Message
header */ unsigned int msg_len; /* Number of received bytes
for header */ };</p>

<p>The msg_hdr field is a msghdr structure, as described in
recvmsg(2). The msg_len field is the number of bytes
returned for the message in the entry. This field has the
same value as the return value of a sin- gle recvmsg(2) on
the header.</p>

<p>The flags argument contains flags ORed together. The
flags are the same as documented for recvmsg(2), with the
following addition:</p>

<p>MSG_WAITFORONE Turns on MSG_DONTWAIT after the first
message has been received.</p>

<p>The timeout argument points to a struct timespec (see
clock_gettime(2)) defining a timeout (seconds plus
nanoseconds) for the receive opera- tion. If timeout is NULL
then the operation blocks indefinitely.</p>

<p>A blocking recvmmsg() call blocks until vlen messages
have been received or until the timeout expires. A
nonblocking call reads as many messages as are available (up
to the limit specified by vlen) and returns immediately.</p>

<p>On return from recvmmsg(), successive elements of msgvec
are updated to contain information about each received
message: msg_len contains the size of the received message;
the subfields of msg_hdr are updated as described in
recvmsg(2). The return value of the call indicates the
number of elements of msgvec that have been updated.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, recvmmsg() returns the number
of messages received in msgvec; on error, -1 is returned,
and errno is set to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS Errors are as for recvmsg(2). In addition, the
following error can occur:</p>

<p>EINVAL timeout is invalid.</p>

<p>VERSIONS The recvmmsg() system call was added in Linux
2.6.32. Support in glibc was added in version 2.12.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO recvmmsg() is Linux-specific.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO clock_gettime(2), recvmsg(2), sendmmsg(2),
sendmsg(2), socket(2), socket(7)</p>
