<p>NAME outocp - debug an OCP file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS outocp OCPFILE[.ocp]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION outocp is used for debugging Omega Compiled
Translation Process (OCP) files. It generates some
statistics about the OCP file, and then runs through the
states that the file defines.</p>

<p>Omega Translation Processes are rules used to translate
one character set to another and to choose between
characters with one or more con- text-sensitive variants.
OTPs could also be used to change the case or hyphenation of
text.</p>

<p>BUGS None known, but report any found to
&lt;omega@ens.fr&gt; (mailing list).</p>
