<p>sane-net(5) SANE Scanner Access Now Easy sane-net(5)</p>

<p>NAME sane-net - SANE network backend</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sane-net library implements a SANE
(Scanner Access Now Easy) back- end that provides access to
image acquisition devices through a network connection. This
makes it possible to control devices attached to a remote
host and also provides a means to grant users access to pro-
tected resources.</p>

<p>DEVICE NAMES This backend expects device names of the
form:</p>

<p>host:device</p>

<p>Where host is the name (or IP address) of the (remote)
host and device is the name of the device on this host that
should be addressed. If the device name does not contain a
colon (:), then the entire string is treated as the device
string for the default host. The default host is the host
listed last in the configuration file (see below).</p>

<p>An IPv6 address can be specified enclosed in square
brackets:</p>

<p>[::1]:device</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION The net.conf file contains both backend
options and a list of host names (or IP addresses) that
should be contacted for scan requests. Anything that isnt
one of the options listed below will be treated as an host
name.</p>

<p>connect_timeout = nsecs Timeout (in seconds) for the
initial connection to the saned server. This will prevent
the backend from blocking for several minutes trying to
connect to an unresponsive saned host (network outage, host
down, ...). The environment variable SANE_NET_TIME- OUT can
also be used to specify the timeout at runtime.</p>

<p>Empty lines and lines starting with a hash mark (#) are
ignored. Note that IPv6 addresses in this file do not need
to be enclosed in square brackets. A sample configuration
file is shown below:</p>

<p>scan-server.somedomain.firm 192.168.0.1 # this is a
comment localhost ::1</p>

<p>The above list of hosts can be extended at run-time
using environment variable SANE_NET_HOSTS. This environment
variable is a colon-sepa- rated list of hostnames or IP
addresses that should be contacted in addition to the hosts
mentioned in the configuration file. For exam- ple, a user
could set the environment variable to the string:</p>

<p>new.scanner.com:[::1]:192.168.0.2:scanner.univ.edu</p>

<p>To request that hosts new.scanner.com , [::1] ,
192.168.0.2 and scan- ner.univ.edu are contacted in addition
to the hosts listed above.</p>

<p>For this backend to function properly, it is also
necessary to define the sane-port service in /etc/services.
The sane service should be defined using a line of the
following form:</p>

<p>sane-port 6566/tcp # SANE network scanner daemon</p>

<p>FILES /etc/sane.d/net.conf The backend configuration
file (see also description of SANE_CONFIG_DIR below).</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-net.a The static library
implementing this backend.</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-net.so The shared library
implementing this backend (present on systems that support
dynamic loading).</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT SANE_CONFIG_DIR This environment variable
specifies the list of directories that may contain the
configuration file. Under UNIX, the directories are
separated by a colon (:), under OS/2, they are separated by
a semi-colon (;). If this variable is not set, the config-
uration file is searched in two default directories: first,
the current working directory (&quot;.&quot;) and then in
/etc/sane.d. If the value of the environment variable ends
with the directory sepa- rator character, then the default
directories are searched after the explicitly specified
directories. For example, setting SANE_CONFIG_DIR to
&quot;/tmp/config:&quot; would result in directories
&quot;tmp/config&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and
&quot;/etc/sane.d&quot; being searched (in this order).</p>

<p>SANE_NET_HOSTS A colon-separated list of host names or
IP addresses to be con- tacted by this backend.</p>

<p>SANE_NET_TIMEOUT Number of seconds to wait for a
response from the saned server for the initial connection
request.</p>

<p>SANE_DEBUG_NET If the library was compiled with debug
support enabled, this environment variable controls the
debug level for this backend. E.g., a value of 128 requests
all debug output to be printed. Smaller levels reduce
verbosity.</p>

<p>BUGS If saned has timed out, the net backend may loop
with authorization requests.</p>
