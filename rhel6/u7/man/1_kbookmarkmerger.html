<p>KBOOKMARKMERGER(1) KDE User s Manual
KBOOKMARKMERGER(1)</p>

<p>NAME kbookmarkmerger - A program for merging a given set
of bookmarks into the users list of bookmarks.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS kbookmarkmerger [Qt Options...] [KDE
Options...] {directory}</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION kbookmarkmerger is a program for merging a
given set of bookmarks into the user s set of bookmarks; if
the user doesnt have any bookmarks created yet, a new
bookmark list is created and the given bookmarks are
inserted into it. While doing this, kbookmarkmerger keeps
track of which files were merged in a previous run already,
so no bookmark will get installed to the users bookmarks
more than once. In case KDE is running while kbookmarkmerger
is executed, the KDE bookmark subsystem will be informed of
any changes to the users bookmarks, so that all applications
accessing that information (i.e. Konqueror) will pick the
changes up instantly.</p>

<p>The traditionally used approach to achieve something
like this was to use carefully crafted skeleton home
directories when creating a new us- er account, to provide
the user with a standard set of bookmarks. The problem with
this approach is that after the user account has been cre-
ated, no new bookmarks can be propagated.</p>

<p>This mechanism is useful for system administrators who
want to propa- gate a bookmark pointing to a certain
document (for instance, important notes about the system) to
all users. Distributors might find it useful as well, for
instance by augmenting the software packages they supply
with bookmark files which kbookmarkmerger merges into the
users book- mark list when the package is installed. That
way, documentation shipped with a software package is easily
and visibly accessible right after the package has been
installed.</p>

<p>The only parameter required by kbookmarkmerger is the
name of a direc- tory which shall be scanned for bookmark
files. All files in the given directory will be considered
for being merged into the users setup. The files in the
given directory should be valid XBEL files.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO Konqueror manual:
help:/konqueror/index.html</p>

<p>EXAMPLES joe@hal9000:~&gt; kbookmarkmerger
/usr/local/extra-bookmarks</p>

<p>Merges all bookmark files stored in
/usr/local/extra-bookmarks into joes list of bookmarks.</p>

<p>STANDARDS XBEL specification:
http://pyxml.sourceforge.net/topics/xbel/</p>

<p>RESTRICTIONS When determining whether a given bookmark
file has been merged into the users bookmarks already or
not, kbookmarkmerger merely looks at the filename of the
bookmark file - the contents are not checked at all. This
means that changing a bookmark file which was already merged
into a users bookmarks will not trigger merging it once
again.</p>

<p>Also note that in case a user modifies a bookmark which
was merged into his setup, the original bookmark file will
be left unmodified.</p>
