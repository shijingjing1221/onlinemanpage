<p>Z8530_RX_DONE(9) Internal Functions Z8530_RX_DONE(9)</p>

<p>NAME z8530_rx_done - Receive completion callback</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS void z8530_rx_done(struct z8530_channel *
c);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS c The channel that completed a receive</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION A new packet is complete. Our goal here is
to get back into receive mode as fast as possible. On the
Z85230 we could change to using ESCC mode, but on the older
chips we have no choice. We flip to the new buffer
immediately in DMA mode so that the DMA of the next frame
can occur while we are copying the previous buffer to an
sk_buff</p>

<p>Called with the lock held</p>
