<p>AMFLUSH(8) System Administration Commands AMFLUSH(8)</p>

<p>NAME amflush - flush Amanda backup files from holding
disk to tape</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS amflush [-b] [-f] [-s] [-D datestamp] config
[host [disk...]...] [-o configoption]...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Amflush writes Amanda backups from the
holding disks to tape, and updates the Amanda info database
and tapelist(5) accordingly. Backups may stay in a holding
disk when something is wrong with the tape at the time
amdump is run. When this happens, the problem must be
corrected and amflush run by hand.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -b Run amflush in batch mode. All datestamps are
selected unless specified. The flush is started without
confirmation.</p>

<p>-f Run amflush in foreground. Amflush normally detaches
itself from the tty and runs as a background process. With
the -f option, amflush stays in the foreground. This is
useful if amflush is run as part of another script that, for
example, advances the tape after the flush is completed.</p>

<p>-s Write log to stdout/stderr instead of the amflush log
file. Requires the -f option.</p>

<p>-D datestamp specify a datestamp expression you want to
flush, see the &quot;DATESTAMP EXPRESSION&quot; section of
amanda(8) for a description. -D 20001225-7 will flush all
dumps from 25 december 2000 to 27 december 2000.</p>

<p>host [disk]* Specify the host and disk on which the
command will work.</p>

<p>-o configoption See the &quot;CONFIGURATION
OVERRIDE&quot; section in amanda(8).</p>

<p>You can specify many host/disk expressions, only disks
that match an expression will be flushed. All disks are
flushed if no expressions are given. see the &quot;HOST
&amp; DISK EXPRESSION&quot; section of amanda(8) for a
description.</p>

<p>Amflush will look in the holding disks specified by the
amanda.conf file in /usr/local/etc/amanda/config for any
non-empty Amanda work directories. It then prompts you to
select a directory or to process all of the directories. The
work directories in the holding disks are named by the date
at the time amdump was run, e.g. 19910215.</p>

<p>See the amanda(8) man page for more details about
Amanda.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE Amflush will search for holding areas associated
with the daily configuration. After you select which holding
area to flush, amflush writes the data to tape, updates the
databases and sends a mail report similar to amdump(8). %
amflush MyConfig Scanning /amanda-hold... 20001113: found
Amanda directory. 20001114: found Amanda directory.</p>

<p>Multiple Amanda directories, please pick one by letter:
A. 20001113 B. 20001114 Select directories to flush [A..B]:
[ALL] all</p>

<p>Flushing dumps in 20001113, 20001114, today: 20001117 to
tape drive /dev/rmt/0mn. Expecting tape DMP014 or a new
tape. (The last dumps were to tape DMP013) Are you sure you
want to do this? yes Running in background, you can log off
now. You&acute;ll get mail when amflush is finished.</p>

<p>The following example causes amflush to flush everything
to tape, then ejects tape, using &acute;at&acute; to run the
task in the background. % echo &acute;amflush -b -f MyConfig
&amp;&amp; mt offline&acute; | at now</p>

<p>EXIT CODE The exit code of amflush is the ORed value of:
0 = success 1 = error 4 = a dle failed 8 = Don&acute;t know
the status of a dle (RESULT_MISSING in the report) 16 = tape
error or no more tape</p>
