<p>NAME XAllowDeviceEvents - release queued events</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;X11/extensions/XInput.h&gt;</p>

<p>int XAllowDeviceEvents( Display *display, XDevice
*device, int event_mode, Time time); display Specifies the
connection to the X server.</p>

<p>device Specifies the device from which events are to be
allowed.</p>

<p>event_mode Specifies the event mode.You can pass
AsyncThisDevice, SyncThisDevice, ReplayThisDevice,
AsyncOtherDevices, SyncAll,or AsyncAll.</p>

<p>time Specifies the time.You can pass either a timestamp
or CurrentTime.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The XAllowDeviceEvents function releases
some queued events if the client has caused a device to
freeze. It has no effect if the specified time is earlier
than the last-grab time of the most recent active grab for
the client and device, or if the specified time is later
than the current X server time.</p>

<p>The following describes the processing that occurs
depending on what constant you pass to the event_mode
argument.</p>

<p>&middot; AsyncThisDevice - If the specified device is
frozen by the client, event processing for that device
continues as usual. If the device is frozen multiple times
by the client on behalf of multiple separate grabs,
AsyncThisDevice thaws for all.AsyncThisDevice has no effect
if the specified device is not frozen by the client, but the
device need not be grabbed by the client.</p>

<p>&middot; SyncThisDevice - If the specified device is
frozen and actively grabbed by the client, event processing
for that device continues normally until the next key or
button event is reported to the client. At this time, the
specified device again appears to freeze. However, if the
reported event causes the grab to be released, the specified
device does not freeze. SyncThisDevice has no effect if the
specified device is not frozen by the client or is not
grabbed by the client.</p>

<p>&middot; ReplayThisDevice - If the specified device is
actively grabbed by the client and is frozen as the result
of an event having been sent to the client (either from the
activation of a GrabDeviceButton or from a previous
AllowDeviceEvents with mode SyncThisDevice, but not from a
GrabDevice), the grab is released and that event is
completely reprocessed. This time, however, the request
ignores any passive grabs at or above (toward the root) that
the grab-window of the grab just released. The request has
no effect if the specified device is not grabbed by the
client or if it is not frozen as the result of an event.</p>

<p>&middot; AsyncOtherDevices - If the remaining devices
are frozen by the client, event processing for them
continues as usual. If the other devices are frozen multiple
times by the client on behalf of multiple grabs,
AsyncOtherDevices &quot;thaws&quot; for all.
AsyncOtherDevices has no effect if the devices are not
frozen by the client.</p>

<p>&middot; SyncAll - If all devices are frozen by the
client, event processing (for all devices) continues
normally until the next button or key event is reported to
the client for a grabbed device, at which time all devices
again appear to freeze. However, if the reported event
causes the grab to be released, then the devices do not
freeze. If any device is still grabbed, then a subsequent
event for it will still cause all devices to freeze. SyncAll
has no effect unless all devices are frozen by the client.
If any device is frozen twice by the client on behalf of two
separate grabs, SyncAll thaws for both. A subsequent freeze
for SyncAll will only freeze each device once.</p>

<p>&middot; AsyncAll - If all devices are frozen by the
client, event processing for all devices continues normally.
If any device is frozen multiple times by the client on
behalf of multiple separate grabs, AsyncAll thaws for all.
AsyncAll has no effect unless all devices are frozen by the
client.</p>

<p>AsyncThisDevice, SyncThisDevice, and ReplayThisDevice
have no effect on the processing of events from the
remaining devices.AsyncOtherDevices has no effect on the
processing of events from the specified device. When the
event_mode is SyncAll or AsyncAll, the device parameter is
ignored.</p>

<p>It is possible for several grabs of different devices by
the same or different clients to be active simultaneously.
If a device is frozen on behalf of any grab, no event
processing is performed for the device. It is possible for a
single device to be frozen because of several grabs. In this
case, the freeze must be released on behalf of each grab
before events can again be processed.</p>

<p>XAllowDeviceEvents can generate a BadDevice or BadValue
error.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS BadDevice An invalid device was specified.
The specified device does not exist or has not been opened
by this client via XOpenInputDevice. This error may also
occur if the specified device is the X keyboard or X pointer
device.</p>

<p>BadValue An invalid mode was specified on the
request.</p>
