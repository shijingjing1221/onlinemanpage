<p>NAME pipe - overview of pipes and FIFOs</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Pipes and FIFOs (also known as named pipes)
provide a unidirectional interprocess communication channel.
A pipe has a read end and a write end. Data written to the
write end of a pipe can be read from the read end of the
pipe.</p>

<p>A pipe is created using pipe(2), which creates a new
pipe and returns two file descriptors, one referring to the
read end of the pipe, the other referring to the write end.
Pipes can be used to create a commu- nication channel
between related processes; see pipe(2) for an example.</p>

<p>A FIFO (short for First In First Out) has a name within
the file system (created using mkfifo(3)), and is opened
using open(2). Any process may open a FIFO, assuming the
file permissions allow it. The read end is opened using the
O_RDONLY flag; the write end is opened using the O_WRONLY
flag. See fifo(7) for further details. Note: although FIFOs
have a pathname in the file system, I/O on FIFOs does not
involve oper- ations on the underlying device (if there is
one).</p>

<p>I/O on Pipes and FIFOs The only difference between pipes
and FIFOs is the manner in which they are created and
opened. Once these tasks have been accomplished, I/O on
pipes and FIFOs has exactly the same semantics.</p>

<p>If a process attempts to read from an empty pipe, then
read(2) will block until data is available. If a process
attempts to write to a full pipe (see below), then write(2)
blocks until sufficient data has been read from the pipe to
allow the write to complete. Non-blocking I/O is possible by
using the fcntl(2) F_SETFL operation to enable the
O_NONBLOCK open file status flag.</p>

<p>The communication channel provided by a pipe is a byte
stream: there is no concept of message boundaries.</p>

<p>If all file descriptors referring to the write end of a
pipe have been closed, then an attempt to read(2) from the
pipe will see end-of-file (read(2) will return 0). If all
file descriptors referring to the read end of a pipe have
been closed, then a write(2) will cause a SIGPIPE signal to
be generated for the calling process. If the calling process
is ignoring this signal, then write(2) fails with the error
EPIPE. An application that uses pipe(2) and fork(2) should
use suitable close(2) calls to close unnecessary duplicate
file descriptors; this ensures that end-of-file and
SIGPIPE/EPIPE are delivered when appropriate.</p>

<p>It is not possible to apply lseek(2) to a pipe.</p>

<p>Pipe Capacity A pipe has a limited capacity. If the pipe
is full, then a write(2) will block or fail, depending on
whether the O_NONBLOCK flag is set (see below). Different
implementations have different limits for the pipe capacity.
Applications should not rely on a particular capacity: an
application should be designed so that a reading process
consumes data as soon as it is available, so that a writing
process does not remain blocked.</p>

<p>In Linux versions before 2.6.11, the capacity of a pipe
was the same as the system page size (e.g., 4096 bytes on
i386). Since Linux 2.6.11, the pipe capacity is 65536
bytes.</p>

<p>PIPE_BUF POSIX.1-2001 says that write(2)s of less than
PIPE_BUF bytes must be atomic: the output data is written to
the pipe as a contiguous sequence. Writes of more than
PIPE_BUF bytes may be non-atomic: the kernel may interleave
the data with data written by other processes. POSIX.1-2001
requires PIPE_BUF to be at least 512 bytes. (On Linux,
PIPE_BUF is 4096 bytes.) The precise semantics depend on
whether the file descriptor is non-blocking (O_NONBLOCK),
whether there are multi- ple writers to the pipe, and on n,
the number of bytes to be written:</p>

<p>O_NONBLOCK disabled, n &lt;= PIPE_BUF All n bytes are
written atomically; write(2) may block if there is not room
for n bytes to be written immediately</p>

<p>O_NONBLOCK enabled, n &lt;= PIPE_BUF If there is room to
write n bytes to the pipe, then write(2) succeeds
immediately, writing all n bytes; otherwise write(2) fails,
with errno set to EAGAIN.</p>

<p>O_NONBLOCK disabled, n &gt; PIPE_BUF The write is
non-atomic: the data given to write(2) may be interleaved
with write(2)s by other process; the write(2) blocks until n
bytes have been written.</p>

<p>O_NONBLOCK enabled, n &gt; PIPE_BUF If the pipe is full,
then write(2) fails, with errno set to EAGAIN. Otherwise,
from 1 to n bytes may be written (i.e., a &quot;partial
write&quot; may occur; the caller should check the return
value from write(2) to see how many bytes were actually
writ- ten), and these bytes may be interleaved with writes
by other processes.</p>

<p>Open File Status Flags The only open file status flags
that can be meaningfully applied to a pipe or FIFO are
O_NONBLOCK and O_ASYNC.</p>

<p>Setting the O_ASYNC flag for the read end of a pipe
causes a signal (SIGIO by default) to be generated when new
input becomes available on the pipe (see fcntl(2) for
details). On Linux, O_ASYNC is supported for pipes and FIFOs
only since kernel 2.6.</p>

<p>Portability notes On some systems (but not Linux), pipes
are bidirectional: data can be transmitted in both
directions between the pipe ends. According to POSIX.1-2001,
pipes only need to be unidirectional. Portable applica-
tions should avoid reliance on bidirectional pipe
semantics.</p>
