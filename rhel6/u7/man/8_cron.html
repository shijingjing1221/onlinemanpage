<p>CRON(8) Cronie Users Manual CRON(8)</p>

<p>NAME cron - daemon to execute scheduled commands</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS cron [-n | -p | -s | -m&lt;mailcommand&gt;]
cron -x [ext,sch,proc,pars,load,misc,test,bit]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Cron should be started from /etc/rc.d/init.d
or /etc/init.d</p>

<p>Cron searches /var/spool/cron for crontab files which
are named after accounts in /etc/passwd; The founded
crontabs are loaded into memory. Cron also searches for
/etc/anacrontab and the files in the /etc/cron.d directory,
which are in a different format (see crontab(5) ). Cron
examines all stored crontabs, checking each command to see
if it should be run in the current minute. When executing
commands, any output is mailed to the owner of the crontab
(or to the user named in the MAILTO environment variable in
the crontab, if such exists). Job output can also be sent to
syslog by using the -s option.</p>

<p>There are two ways, how the changes are checked in
crontables. The first is checking the modtime of file and
the other is using inotify support. You can find out which
of them are you using, if you check /var/log/cron where is
(or isnt) inotify mentioned after start of dae- mon. The
inotify support is watching for changes in all crontables
and touch the disk only in case that something was
changed.</p>

<p>In other case cron checks each minute to see if its
crontables modtime have changes and reload those which have
changes. There is no need to restart cron after some of the
crontable is modified. The modtime option is used also when
inotify couldnt be initialized.</p>

<p>Cron is checking those files or directories:
/etc/anacrontab system crontab is usually for running daily,
weekly, monthly jobs. /etc/cron.d/ where are system cronjobs
stored for different users. /var/spool/cron that s mean
spool directory for user crontables.</p>

<p>Note that the crontab(1) command updates the modtime of
the spool directory whenever it changes a crontab.</p>

<p>Daylight Saving Time and other time changes Local time
changes of less than three hours, such as those caused by
the start or end of Daylight Saving Time, are handled
specially. This only applies to jobs that run at a specific
time and jobs that are run with a granularity greater than
one hour. Jobs that run more fre- quently are scheduled
normally.</p>

<p>If time has moved forward, those jobs that would have
run in the inter- val that has been skipped will be run
immediately. Conversely, if time has moved backward, care is
taken to avoid running jobs twice.</p>

<p>Time changes of more than 3 hours are considered to be
corrections to the clock or timezone, and the new time is
used immediately.</p>

<p>It s possible to use different time zones for cron
tables. More could be found in crontab(5).</p>

<p>PAM Access Control On Red Hat systems, crond now
supports access control with PAM - see pam(8). A PAM
configuration file for crond is installed in
/etc/pam.d/crond. crond loads the PAM environment from the
pam_env module, but these can be overriden by settings in
the appropriate crontab file.</p>

<p>OPTIONS As a special case, the string off will disable
sending mail.</p>

<p>-s This option will direct cron to send job output to
the system log using syslog(3). This is useful if your
system has no send- mail(8), or if mail is disabled using -m
off.</p>

<p>-m This option allows you to specify a shell command
string to use for sending cron mail output instead of
sendmail(8). This com- mand must accept a fully formatted
mail message (with headers) on stdin and send it as a mail
message to the recipients speci- fied in the mail
headers.</p>

<p>-n This option changes default behavior causing it to
run crond in the foreground. This can be useful when
starting it out of init.</p>

<p>-p Cron permit any crontab, which user set.</p>

<p>-x With this option is possible to set debug flags.</p>

<p>-P Dont set PATH. PATH is instead inherited from the
environment.</p>

<p>SIGNALS On receipt of a SIGHUP, the cron daemon will
close and reopen its log file. This is useful in scripts
which rotate and age log files. Natu- rally this is not
relevant if cron was built to use syslog(3).</p>

<p>CAVEATS The crontab files have to be regular files or
symlinks to regular files, they must not be executable or
writable by anyone else than the owner. This requirement can
be overridden by using the -p option on the crond command
line. If inotify support is in use, changes in the symlinked
crontabs are not automatically noticed by the cron daemon.
The cron daemon must receive a SIGHUP to reload the
crontabs. This is a limitation of inotify API.</p>
