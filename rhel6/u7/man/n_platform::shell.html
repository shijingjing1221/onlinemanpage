<p>platform::shell(n) Tcl Bundled Packages

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME platform::shell - System identification support
code and utilities</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS package require platform::shell ?1.1.4?</p>

<p>platform::shell::generic shell platform::shell::identify
shell platform::shell::platform shell
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The platform::shell package provides several
utility commands useful for the identification of the
architecture of a specific Tcl shell.</p>

<p>This package allows the identification of the
architecture of a spe- cific Tcl shell different from the
shell running the package. The only requirement is that the
other shell (identified by its path), is actu- ally
executable on the current machine.</p>

<p>While for most platform this means that the architecture
of the inter- rogated shell is identical to the architecture
of the running shell this is not generally true. A counter
example are all platforms which have 32 and 64 bit variants
and where a 64bit system is able to run 32bit code. For
these running and interrogated shell may have different
32/64 bit settings and thus different identifiers.</p>

<p>For applications like a code repository it is important
to identify the architecture of the shell which will
actually run the installed pack- ages, versus the
architecture of the shell running the repository soft-
ware.</p>

<p>COMMANDS platform::shell::identify shell This command
does the same identification as platform::identify, for the
specified Tcl shell, in contrast to the running shell.</p>

<p>platform::shell::generic shell This command does the
same identification as platform::generic, for the specified
Tcl shell, in contrast to the running shell.</p>

<p>platform::shell::platform shell This command returns the
contents of tcl_platform(platform) for the specified Tcl
shell.</p>

<p>KEYWORDS operating system, cpu architecture, platform,
architecture</p>
