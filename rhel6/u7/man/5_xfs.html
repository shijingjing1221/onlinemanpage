<p>NAME xfs - layout of the XFS filesystem</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION An XFS filesystem can reside on a regular
disk partition or on a logi- cal volume. An XFS filesystem
has up to three parts: a data section, a log section, and a
realtime section. Using the default mkfs.xfs(8) options, the
realtime section is absent, and the log area is contained
within the data section. The log section can be either
separate from the data section or contained within it. The
filesystem sections are divided into a certain number of
blocks, whose size is specified at mkfs.xfs(8) time with the
-b option.</p>

<p>The data section contains all the filesystem metadata
(inodes, directo- ries, indirect blocks) as well as the user
file data for ordinary (non- realtime) files and the log
area if the log is internal to the data section. The data
section is divided into a number of allocation groups. The
number and size of the allocation groups are chosen by
mkfs.xfs(8) so that there is normally a small number of
equal-sized groups. The number of allocation groups controls
the amount of paral- lelism available in file and block
allocation. It should be increased from the default if there
is sufficient memory and a lot of allocation activity. The
number of allocation groups should not be set very high,
since this can cause large amounts of CPU time to be used by
the filesystem, especially when the filesystem is nearly
full. More allo- cation groups are added (of the original
size) when xfs_growfs(8) is run.</p>

<p>The log section (or area, if it is internal to the data
section) is used to store changes to filesystem metadata
while the filesystem is running until those changes are made
to the data section. It is writ- ten sequentially during
normal operation and read only during mount. When mounting a
filesystem after a crash, the log is read to complete
operations that were in progress at the time of the
crash.</p>

<p>The realtime section is used to store the data of
realtime files. These files had an attribute bit set through
xfsctl(3) after file cre- ation, before any data was written
to the file. The realtime section is divided into a number
of extents of fixed size (specified at mkfs.xfs(8) time).
Each file in the realtime section has an extent size that is
a multiple of the realtime section extent size.</p>

<p>Each allocation group contains several data structures.
The first sec- tor contains the superblock. For allocation
groups after the first, the superblock is just a copy and is
not updated after mkfs.xfs(8). The next three sectors
contain information for block and inode alloca- tion within
the allocation group. Also contained within each alloca-
tion group are data structures to locate free blocks and
inodes; these are located through the header structures.</p>

<p>Each XFS filesystem is labeled with a Universal Unique
Identifier (UUID). The UUID is stored in every allocation
group header and is used to help distinguish one XFS
filesystem from another, therefore you should avoid using
dd(1) or other block-by-block copying programs to copy XFS
filesystems. If two XFS filesystems on the same machine have
the same UUID, xfsdump(8) may become confused when doing
incremental and resumed dumps. xfsdump(8) and xfsrestore(8)
are recommended for making copies of XFS filesystems.</p>

<p>OPERATIONS Some functionality specific to the XFS
filesystem is accessible to applications through the
xfsctl(3) and by-handle (see open_by_handle(3))
interfaces.</p>

<p>MOUNT OPTIONS Refer to the mount(8) manual entry for
descriptions of the individual XFS mount options.</p>

xfs_admin(8), xfs- dump(8), xfsrestore(8).</p>
