<p>NAME smistrip - extract MIB or PIB modules from text
files, like RFCs or I- Ds</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS smistrip [ -Vhn ] [ -d dir ] [ -m module ] [
file(s) ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The smistrip program is used to extract MIB
and PIB module files from ASCII documents like RFCs or
Internet Drafts. Modules are identified by a starting ASN.1
DEFINITIONS clause and the matching END clause. The output
is written to files named by the modules names.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -V Show the smistrip version and exit.</p>

<p>-h Show a help text and exit.</p>

<p>-n Print only what would be extracted, but do not write
any output file.</p>

<p>-d dir Write module file(s) to directory dir instead of
the current working directory.</p>

<p>-m module Extract only the module module instead of all
modules found in the input file(s).</p>

<p>file(s) The input text file(s) from which modules will
be extracted. If no file is given, input is read from
stdin.</p>

<p>Note that smistrip tries to be smart about locating
module start and end, detecting page breaks and blank lines
near page breaks. It also tries to cut off blank prefixing
columns from all lines of a modules. However, there might by
documents that cannot be parsed correctly by smistrip and
probably produce incorrect output. You might consider to use
smilint on every extracted module file to check its
syntactical correctness.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE This example extracts only the module IPV6-MIB
from the file rfc2465 and writes it to the directory
/usr/local/tmp. $ smistrip -d /usr/local/tmp -m IPV6-MIB
rfc2465</p>
