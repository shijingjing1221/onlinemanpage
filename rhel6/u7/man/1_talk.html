<p>TALK(1) BSD General Commands Manual TALK(1)</p>

<p>NAME talk - talk to another user</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS talk person [-x] [ttyname]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Talk is a visual communication program which
copies lines from your ter- minal to that of another
user.</p>

<p>Options available:</p>

<p>person If you wish to talk to someone on your own
machine, then person is just the persons login name. If you
wish to talk to a user on another host, then person is of
the form user@host ( or host.user or host!user or host:user
).</p>

<p>-x If you wish to talk to a user who has dot character
in username, the -x argument will force user@host form of
the person and talk will take dots as part of user name.</p>

<p>ttyname If you wish to talk to a user who is logged in
more than once, the ttyname argument may be used to indicate
the appropriate terminal name, where ttyname is of the form
ttyXX or pts/X.</p>

<p>When first called, talk contacts the talk daemon on the
other users machine, which sends the message Message from
TalkDaemon@his_machine... talk: connection requested by
your_name@your_machine. talk: respond with: talk
your_name@your_machine</p>

<p>to that user. At this point, he then replies by
typing</p>

<p>talk your_name@your_machine</p>

<p>It doesn t matter from which machine the recipient
replies, as long as his login name is the same. Once
communication is established, the two parties may type
simultaneously; their output will appear in separate
windows. Typing control-L (^L) will cause the screen to be
reprinted. The erase, kill line, and word erase characters
(normally ^H, ^U, and ^W respectively) will behave normally.
To exit, just type the interrupt character (normally ^C);
talk then moves the cursor to the bottom of the screen and
restores the terminal to its previous state.</p>

<p>As of netkit-ntalk 0.15 talk supports scrollback; use
esc-p and esc-n to scroll your window, and ctrl-p and ctrl-n
to scroll the other window. These keys are now opposite from
the way they were in 0.16; while this will probably be
confusing at first, the rationale is that the key combi-
nations with escape are harder to type and should therefore
be used to scroll ones own screen, since one needs to do
that much less often.</p>

<p>If you do not want to receive talk requests, you may
block them using the mesg(1) command. By default, talk
requests are normally not blocked. Certain commands, in
particular nroff(1), pine(1), and pr(1), may block messages
temporarily in order to prevent messy output.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/hosts to find the recipients machine
/var/run/utmp to find the recipients tty</p>

talkd(8)</p>

<p>BUGS The protocol used to communicate with the talk
daemon is braindead.</p>

<p>Also, the version of talk(1) released with 4.2BSD uses a
different and even more braindead protocol that is
completely incompatible. Some vendor Unixes (particularly
those from Sun) have been found to use this old pro-
tocol.</p>

<p>Old versions of talk may have trouble running on
machines with more than one IP address, such as machines
with dynamic SLIP or PPP connections. This problem is fixed
as of netkit-ntalk 0.11, but may affect people you are
trying to communicate with.</p>

<p>HISTORY The talk command appeared in 4.2BSD.</p>

<p>Linux NetKit (0.17) November 24, 1999 Linux NetKit
(0.17)</p>
