<p>Tk_GetVisual(3) Tk Library Procedures
Tk_GetVisual(3)</p>


<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME Tk_GetVisual - translate from string to visual</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tk.h&gt;</p>

<p>Visual * Tk_GetVisual(interp, tkwin, string, depthPtr,
colormapPtr)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS Tcl_Interp *interp (in) Interpreter to use for
error reporting.</p>

<p>Tk_Window tkwin (in) Token for window in which the
visual will be used.</p>

<p>const char *string (in) String that identifies the
desired visual. See below for valid formats.</p>

<p>int *depthPtr (out) Depth of returned visual gets stored
here.</p>

<p>Colormap *colormapPtr (out) If non-NULL then a suitable
col- ormap for visual is found and its identifier is stored
here.

<p>DESCRIPTION Tk_GetVisual takes a string description of a
visual and finds a suit- able X Visual for use in tkwin, if
there is one. It returns a pointer to the X Visual structure
for the visual and stores the number of bits per pixel for
it at *depthPtr. If string is unrecognizable or if no
suitable visual could be found, then NULL is returned and
Tk_GetVisual leaves an error message in interp-&gt;result.
If colormap is non-NULL then Tk_GetVisual also locates an
appropriate colormap for use with the result visual and
stores its X identifier at *colormapPtr.</p>

<p>The string argument specifies the desired visual in one
of the follow- ing ways:</p>

<p>class depth The string consists of a class name followed
by an inte- ger depth, with any amount of white space
(including none) in between. class selects what sort of
visual is desired and must be one of directcolor, grayscale,
greyscale, pseudocolor, staticcolor, staticgray, static-
grey, or truecolor, or a unique abbreviation. depth
specifies how many bits per pixel are needed for the visual.
If possible, Tk_GetVisual will return a visual with this
depth; if there is no visual of the desired depth then
Tk_GetVisual looks first for a visual with greater depth,
then one with less depth.</p>

<p>default Use the default visual for tkwins screen.</p>

<p>pathName Use the visual for the window given by
pathName. path- Name must be the name of a window on the
same screen as tkwin.</p>

<p>number Use the visual whose X identifier is number.</p>

<p>best ?depth? Choose the best possible visual, using the
following rules, in decreasing order of priority:</p>

<p>(a) a visual that has exactly the desired depth is best,
followed by a visual with greater depth than requested (but
as little extra as possible), followed by a visual with less
depth than requested (but as great a depth as possible);</p>

<p>(b) if no depth is specified, then the deepest avail-
able visual is chosen;</p>

<p>(c) pseudocolor is better than truecolor or direct-
color, which are better than staticcolor, which is better
than staticgray or grayscale;</p>

<p>(d) the default visual for the screen is better than any
other visual.</p>

<p>CREDITS The idea for Tk_GetVisual, and the first
implementation, came from Paul Mackerras.</p>
