<p>curl_multi_perform(3) libcurl Manual
curl_multi_perform(3)</p>

<p>NAME curl_multi_perform - reads/writes available data
from each easy handle</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;curl/curl.h&gt;</p>

<p>CURLMcode curl_multi_perform(CURLM *multi_handle, int
*running_han- dles);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION When the app thinks there s data available
for the multi_handle, it should call this function to
read/write whatever there is to read or write right now.
curl_multi_perform() returns as soon as the reads/writes are
done. This function does not require that there actu- ally
is any data available for reading or that data can be
written, it can be called just in case. It will write the
number of handles that still transfer data in the second
argument s integer-pointer.</p>

<p>When you call curl_multi_perform() and the amount of
running_handles is changed from the previous call (or is
less than the amount of easy han- dles youve added to the
multi handle), you know that there is one or more transfers
less &quot;running&quot;. You can then call
curl_multi_info_read(3) to get information about each
individual com- pleted transfer, and that returned info
includes CURLcode and more.</p>

<p>When running_handles is set to zero (0) on the return of
this function, there is no longer any transfers in
progress.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE CURLMcode type, general libcurl multi
interface error code.</p>

<p>If you receive CURLM_CALL_MULTI_PERFORM, this basically
means that you should call curl_multi_perform again, before
you select() on more actions. You don t have to do it
immediately, but the return code means that libcurl may have
more data available to return or that there may be more data
to send off before it is &quot;satisfied&quot;. Do note that
curl_multi_perform(3) will return CURLM_CALL_MULTI_PERFORM
only when it wants to be called again immediately. When
things are fine and there is nothing immediate it wants
done, itll return CURLM_OK and you need to wait for
&quot;action&quot; and then call this function again.</p>

<p>NOTE that this only returns errors etc regarding the
whole multi stack. Problems still might have occurred on
individual transfers even when this function returns
CURLM_OK.</p>

<p>TYPICAL USAGE Most applications will use
curl_multi_fdset(3) to get the multi_han- dles file
descriptors, then itll wait for action on them using
select(3) and as soon as one or more of them are ready,
curl_multi_per- form(3) gets called.</p>
