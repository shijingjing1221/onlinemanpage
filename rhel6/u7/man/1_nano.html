<p>NAME nano - Nanos ANOther editor, an enhanced free Pico
clone</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS nano [OPTIONS] [[+LINE,COLUMN] FILE]...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page briefly documents the nano
command.</p>

<p>nano is a small, free and friendly editor which aims to
replace Pico, the default editor included in the non-free
Pine package. Rather than just copying Picos look and feel,
nano also implements some missing (or disabled by default)
features in Pico, such as &quot;search and replace&quot; and
&quot;go to line and column number&quot;.</p>

<p>OPTIONS +LINE,COLUMN Places cursor at line number LINE
and column number COLUMN (at least one of which must be
specified) on startup, instead of the default of line 1,
column 1.</p>

<p>-? Same as -h (--help).</p>

<p>-A (--smarthome) Make the Home key smarter. When Home is
pressed anywhere but at the very beginning of non-whitespace
characters on a line, the cursor will jump to that beginning
(either forwards or back- wards). If the cursor is already
at that position, it will jump to the true beginning of the
line.</p>

<p>-B (--backup) When saving a file, back up the previous
version of it to the current filename suffixed with a ~.</p>

<p>-C dir (--backupdir=dir) Set the directory where nano
puts unique backup files if file backups are enabled.</p>

<p>-D (--boldtext) Use bold text instead of reverse video
text.</p>

<p>-E (--tabstospaces) Convert typed tabs to spaces.</p>

<p>-F (--multibuffer) Enable multiple file buffers, if
available.</p>

<p>-H (--historylog) Log search and replace strings to
~/.nano_history, so they can be retrieved in later sessions,
if nanorc support is available.</p>

<p>-I (--ignorercfiles) Dont look at SYSCONFDIR/nanorc or
~/.nanorc, if nanorc support is available.</p>

<p>-K (--rebindkeypad) Interpret the numeric keypad keys so
that they all work prop- erly. You should only need to use
this option if they dont, as mouse support wont work
properly with this option enabled.</p>

<p>-L (--nonewlines) Dont add newlines to the ends of
files.</p>

<p>-N (--noconvert) Disable automatic conversion of files
from DOS/Mac format.</p>

<p>-O (--morespace) Use the blank line below the titlebar
as extra editing space.</p>

<p>-Q str (--quotestr=str) Set the quoting string for
justifying. The default is &quot;^([ t]*[#:&gt;|}])+&quot;
if extended regular expression support is available, or
&quot;&gt; &quot; otherwise. Note that t stands for a
Tab.</p>

<p>-R (--restricted) Restricted mode: don t read or write
to any file not specified on the command line; read any
nanorc files; allow suspending; allow a file to be appended
to, prepended to, or saved under a different name if it
already has one; or use backup files or spell checking. Also
accessible by invoking nano with any name beginning with r
(e.g. &quot;rnano&quot;).</p>

<p>-S (--smooth) Enable smooth scrolling. Text will scroll
line-by-line, instead of the usual chunk-by-chunk
behavior.</p>

<p>-T cols (--tabsize=cols) Set the size (width) of a tab
to cols columns. The value of cols must be greater than 0.
The default value is 8.</p>

<p>-U (--quickblank) Do quick statusbar blanking. Statusbar
messages will disappear after 1 keystroke instead of 25.
Note that -c overrides this.</p>

<p>-V (--version) Show the current version number and
exit.</p>

<p>-W (--wordbounds) Detect word boundaries more accurately
by treating punctuation characters as part of a word.</p>

<p>-Y str (--syntax=str) Specify a specific syntax
highlighting from the nanorc to use, if available.</p>

<p>-c (--const) Constantly show the cursor position. Note
that this overrides -U.</p>

<p>-d (--rebinddelete) Interpret the Delete key differently
so that both Backspace and Delete work properly. You should
only need to use this option if Backspace acts like Delete
on your system.</p>

<p>-h (--help) Show a summary of command line options and
exit.</p>

<p>-i (--autoindent) Indent new lines to the previous line
s indentation. Useful when editing source code.</p>

<p>-k (--cut) Enable cut from cursor to end of line.</p>

<p>-l (--nofollow) If the file being edited is a symbolic
link, replace the link with a new file instead of following
it. Good for editing files in /tmp, perhaps?</p>

<p>-m (--mouse) Enable mouse support, if available for your
system. When enabled, mouse clicks can be used to place the
cursor, set the mark (with a double click), and execute
shortcuts. The mouse will work in the X Window System, and
on the console when gpm is running.</p>

<p>-o dir (--operatingdir=dir) Set operating directory.
Makes nano set up something similar to a chroot.</p>

<p>-p (--preserve) Preserve the XON and XOFF sequences (^Q
and ^S) so they will be caught by the terminal.</p>

<p>-r cols (--fill=cols) Wrap lines at column cols. If this
value is 0 or less, wrapping will occur at the width of the
screen less cols columns, allow- ing the wrap point to vary
along with the width of the screen if the screen is resized.
The default value is -8.</p>

<p>-s prog (--speller=prog) Enable alternative spell
checker command.</p>

<p>-t (--tempfile) Always save changed buffer without
prompting. Same as Picos -t option.</p>

<p>-v (--view) View file (read only) mode.</p>

<p>-w (--nowrap) Disable wrapping of long lines.</p>

<p>-x (--nohelp) Disable help screen at bottom of
editor.</p>

<p>-z (--suspend) Enable suspend ability.</p>

<p>-a, -b, -e, -f, -g, -j Ignored, for compatibility with
Pico.</p>

<p>INITIALIZATION FILE nano will read initialization files
in the following order: SYSCONFDIR/nanorc, then ~/.nanorc.
Please see nanorc(5) and the exam- ple file nanorc.sample,
both of which should be provided with nano.</p>

<p>NOTES If no alternative spell checker command is
specified on the command line or in one of the nanorc files,
nano will check the SPELL environ- ment variable for
one.</p>

<p>In some cases nano will try to dump the buffer into an
emergency file. This will happen mainly if nano receives a
SIGHUP or SIGTERM or runs out of memory. It will write the
buffer into a file named nano.save if the buffer didn t have
a name already, or will add a &quot;.save&quot; suffix to
the current filename. If an emergency file with that name
already exists in the current directory, it will add
&quot;.save&quot; plus a number (e.g. &quot;.save.1&quot;)
to the current filename in order to make it unique. In
multibuffer mode, nano will write all the open buffers to
their respective emergency files.</p>
