<p>IBDIAGNET(1) IB DIAGNOSTIC PACKAGE IBDIAGNET(1)</p>

<p>NAME ibdiagnet - IB diagnostic net</p>

<p>SYNOPSYS ibdiagnet [-c &lt;count&gt;] [-v] [-r] [-vlr]
[-u] [-o &lt;out-dir&gt;] [-t &lt;topo-file&gt;] [-s
&lt;sys-name&gt;] [-i &lt;dev-index&gt;] [-p
&lt;port-num&gt;] [-wt] [-pm] [-pc] [-P
&lt;&lt;PM&gt;=&lt;Value&gt;&gt;] [-lw &lt;1x|4x|12x&gt;]
[-ls &lt;2.5|5|10&gt;] [-skip &lt;ibdiag_check/s&gt;]
[-load_db &lt;db_file&gt;]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION ibdiagnet scans the fabric using directed
route packets and extracts all the available information
regarding its connectivity and devices. It then produces the
following files in the output directory (which defined by
the -o option (see below)).</p>

<p>FILES ibdiagnet.log - A dump of all the application
reports generate according to the provided flags</p>

<p>ibdiagnet.lst - List of all the nodes, ports and links
in the fabric</p>

<p>ibdiagnet.fdbs - A dump of the unicast forwarding tables
of the fabric switches</p>

<p>ibdiagnet.mcfdbs - A dump of the multicast forwarding
tables of the fabric switches</p>

<p>ibdiagnet.masks - In case of duplicate port/node Guids,
these file include the map between masked Guid and real
Guids</p>

<p>ibdiagnet.sm - List of all the SM (state and priority)
in the fabric</p>

<p>ibdiagnet.pm - A dump of the pm Counters values, of the
fabric links</p>

<p>ibdiagnet.pkey - A dump of the the existing partitions
and their member host ports</p>

<p>ibdiagnet.mcgs - A dump of the multicast groups, their
properties and member host ports</p>

<p>ibdiagnet.psl - A dump of the path record SL of each
possible source node guid and DLID pairs. Created only if
-vlr option is provided</p>

<p>ibdiagnet.slvl - A dump of the SL2VL Tables from all the
switches. Created only if -vlr option is provided</p>

<p>ibdiagnet.db - A dump of the internal subnet database.
This file can be loaded in later runs using the -load_db
option</p>

<p>In addition to generating the files above, the discovery
phase also checks for duplicate node/port GUIDs in the IB
fabric. If such an error is detected, it is displayed on the
standard output. After the discovery phase is completed,
directed route packets are sent multiple times (according to
the -c option) to detect possible problematic paths on which
packets may be lost. Such paths are explored, and a report
of the suspected bad links is displayed on the standard
output.</p>

<p>After scanning the fabric, if the -r option is provided,
a full report of the fabric qualities is displayed. This
report includes:</p>

<p>&middot; SM report</p>

<p>&middot; Number of nodes and systems</p>

<p>&middot; Hop-count information</p>

<p>maximal hop-count, an example path, and a hop-count
histogram &middot; All CA-to-CA paths traced</p>

<p>&middot; Credit loop report</p>

<p>&middot; mgid-mlid-HCAs multicast group and report</p>

<p>&middot; Partitions report</p>

<p>&middot; IPoIB report</p>

<p>Note: In case the IB fabric includes only one CA, then
CA-to-CA paths are not reported. Furthermore, if a topology
file is provided, ibdiagnet uses the names defined in it for
the output reports.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -c &lt;count&gt; : Min number of packets to be
sent across each link (default = 10) -v : Enable verbose
mode -r : Provides a report of the fabric qualities -u :
Credit loop check based on UpDown rules -t &lt;topo-file&gt;
: Specifies the topology file name -s &lt;sys-name&gt; :
Specifies the local system name. Meaningful only if a
topology file is specified -i &lt;dev-index&gt; : Specifies
the index of the device of the port used to connect to the
IB fabric (in case of multiple devices on the local system)
-p &lt;port-num&gt; : Specifies the local devices port num
used to connect to the IB fabric -o &lt;out-dir&gt; :
Specifies the directory where the output files will be
placed (default = /var/cache/ibutils) -lw &lt;1x|4x|12x&gt;
: Specifies the expected link width -ls &lt;2.5|5|10&gt; :
Specifies the expected link speed -pm : Dump all the fabric
links, pm Counters into ibdiagnet.pm -pc : Reset all the
fabric links pmCounters -P &lt;PM=&lt;Trash&gt;&gt; : If any
of the provided pm is greater then its provided value, print
it to screen -skip &lt;skip-option(s)&gt; : Skip the
executions of the selected checks. Skip options (one or more
can be specified) : dup_guids zero_guids pm logical_state
part ipoib all -wt &lt;file-name&gt;&gt; : Write out the
discovered topology into the given file. This flag is useful
if you later want to check for changes from the current
state of the fabric. A directory named ibdiag_ibnl is also
created by this option, and holds the IBNL files required to
load this topology. To use these files you will need to set
the environment variable named IBDM_IBNL_PATH to that
directory. The directory is located in /var/cache/ibutils or
in the output directory provided by the -o flag. -load_db
&lt;file-name&gt;&gt; : Load subnet data from the given .db
file, and skip subnet discovery stage. Note: Some of the
checks require actual subnet discovery, and therefore would
not run when load_db is specified. These checks are :
Duplicated/zero guids, link state, SMs status. -vlr : VL
based Routing - provide this option to create the paths SL
file (psl), SL2VL file (slvl) and use them in credit loops
check (if -r option is provided). NOTE: Since number of
paths is N^2 extracting the PSL file may take some time.</p>

<p>-h|--help : Prints the help page information
-V|--version : Prints the version of the tool --vars :
Prints the tool s environment variables and their values</p>

<p>ERROR CODES 1 - Failed to fully discover the fabric 2 -
Failed to parse command line options 3 - Failed to intract
with IB fabric 4 - Failed to use local device or local port
5 - Failed to use Topology File 6 - Failed to load requierd
