<p>sane-canon(5) SANE Scanner Access Now Easy
sane-canon(5)</p>

<p>NAME sane-canon - SANE backend for Canon SCSI
scanners</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sane-canon library implements a SANE
(Scanner Access Now Easy) backend that provides access to
the following Canon flatbed and film scanners:</p>

<p>CanoScan 300 CanoScan 600 CanoScan FB620S CanoScan
FB1200S CanoScan FS2700F CanoScan FS2710S</p>

<p>Parallel port and USB scanners are not supported by this
backend; see the manual pages for sane-canon_pp and
sane-canon630u for further information.</p>

<p>IMPORTANT: This is beta code. We tested the code on the
scanners listed above, using the computers and operating
systems available to us, but we cannot guarantee that the
backend will work smoothly with future operating systems,
SCSI adapters, SANE frontend programs, or Canon scanners not
contained in the list above. In some cases your computer
might even hang. It cannot be excluded (although we consider
it extremely unlikely) that your scanner will be
damaged.</p>

<p>That said, TESTERS ARE WELCOME. Send your bug reports
and comments to Manuel Panea &lt;mpd@rzg.mpg.de&gt;; for
questions concerning the FB620 and FB1200S contact Mitsuru
Okaniwa &lt;m-okaniwa@bea.hi-ho.ne.jp&gt;, for the FS2710S
Ulrich Deiters &lt;ukd@xenon.pc.uni-koeln.de&gt;.</p>

<p>TIPS (FS2700F) Scanning either slides or negatives has
been found to require rather large gamma corrections of
about 2.2 to 2.4 (same value for red, green, and blue). It
is recommended to use the automatic exposure controls of the
frontend xsane for best results.</p>

<p>The &quot;Auto Focus&quot; function triggers a special
pass to determine the focus value. After that, the real
scanning pass takes place.</p>

<p>Even with &quot;Auto Focus&quot; turned on, the scanned
image is often a bit too blurred. Using the GIMP to do a
&quot;Filter-&gt;Enhance-&gt;Sharpen&quot; at about 40 to 60
improves the image considerably.</p>

<p>TIPS (FS2710S) Gamma corrections are done not by the
scanner, but by the backend. The scanner is always run in
12-bit mode. In &quot;color&quot; mode the image data are
corrected for gamma, shadow point, etc., and then truncated
to 8-bit intensities; the default gamma value is 2.0. In
&quot;raw&quot; mode the image data are exported without
corrections as 16-bit intensities; this mode can be
recommended if extensive adjustments have to be made to a
picture (and if the frontend can handle 16-bit
intensities).</p>

<p>Negatives are handled by simple color inversion and may
require manual removal of blue discoloration.</p>

<p>FILES /usr/lib64/sane/libsane-canon.a The static library
implementing this backend.</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-canon.so The shared library
implementing this backend (present on systems that support
dynamic loading).</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT SANE_DEBUG_CANON If the library was compiled
with debug support enabled, this environment variable
controls the debug level for this backend. Higher debug
levels increase the verbosity of the output.</p>

<p>Example: export SANE_DEBUG_CANON=4</p>
