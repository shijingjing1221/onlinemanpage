<p>NAME pmafm - Performance Co-Pilot archive folio
manager</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pmafm folioname [command [arg ...]]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION A collection of one or more Performance
Co-Pilot (PCP) archive logs may be combined with a control
file to produce a PCP archive folio. Archive folios are
created using either mkaf(1) or the interactive record mode
services of PCP clients like pmchart(1).</p>

<p>pmafm provides a number of services that may be used to
process folios. In particular, it provides support for
execution of PCP tools using one or more of the component
archive logs within an archive folio.</p>

<p>The target folio is identified by the folio control file
folioname. The syntax for a folio control file is described
in mkaf(1).</p>

<p>If present, the command and arguments following
folioname are inter- preted and executed as a single
command, otherwise commands are read from standard
input.</p>

<p>The following commands are supported.</p>

<p>archives Subsequent commands apply to all archives in
the folio.</p>

<p>archives N[,...] Archives within a folio are numbered 1,
2, etc. Subsequent com- mands are restricted to apply only
to the designated archives.</p>

<p>archives name[,...] Archives within a folio have unique
names. Subsequent commands are restricted to apply only to
the designated archives.</p>

<p>check Validate the presence and format of each file in
the folio and the component archives.</p>

<p>help A brief reminder of the command syntax. ? is a
synonym for help.</p>

<p>hosts Subsequent commands apply to all archives in the
folio.</p>

<p>hosts hostname[,...] Subsequent commands are restricted
to apply only to those archives that match the designated
hostnames.</p>

<p>list [verbose] Display the contents of the folio. By
default the control header and the ordinal number, hostname
and archive base name for each archive in the folio. The
verbose option causes pmafm to dump the label record from
each archive using pmdumplog -l.</p>

<p>The first named archive in the folio is assumed to be
associated with the default host for any tool that tries to
replay multiple archives from the folio.</p>

<p>quit Exit pmafm.</p>

<p>remove Echo on standard output the sh(1) commands
required to remove all of the physical files associated with
this archive folio.</p>

<p>repeat tool [arg ...] Execute the known PCP tool once
per selected archive. For exam- ple, the command repeat
pmval -t60 kernel.all.load would run pmval(1) once per
archive, with an appropriate -a argument.</p>

<p>replay Some archive folios are created by tools (e.g.
pmchart(1)) that provide sufficient information to allow all
of the information in all of the archives of a folio to be
replayed.</p>

<p>[run] tool [arg ...] Execute the known PCP tool on the
selected archives. Some PCP tools are able to process
multiple concurrent archives, and in this case the tool is
run once with the list of all selected archives passed via a
-a argument. Otherwise, this command is synonymous with
repeat.</p>

<p>selections Display those archives that would be selected
for processing with a repeat, replay or run command.</p>

<p>The restrictions via any hosts and archives commands are
conjuncted. These restrictions serve to limit the specific
archives processed in the subsequent repeat, replay, run and
selections commands. By default, all archives are
selected.</p>

<p>Keywords in commands may be abbreviated provided no
ambiguity is intro- duced, e.g. help, hel and he are
synonymous, but h is ambiguous.</p>

<p>FILES $PCP_VAR_DIR/config/pmafm/* control files that
define the behavior of each PCP tool known to pmafm. This
information may be customized or extended, see
$PCP_VAR_DIR/config/pmafm/pcp for documentation of the
syntax and semantics of these files. $HOME/.pcp/pmafm/* User
customization of the control files. All files in this
directory are treated in the same manner as control files in
the $PCP_VAR_DIR/config/pmafm directory.</p>

<p>PCP ENVIRONMENT Environment variables with the prefix
PCP_ are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP. On each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in pcp.conf(5).</p>

<p>SEE ALSO mkaf(1), pmchart(1), pmview(1), PMAPI(3),
pmRecordSetup(3), pcp.conf(5) and pcp.env(5).</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS Many, but all are intended to be easily
understood.</p>
