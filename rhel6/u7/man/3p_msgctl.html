<p>MSGCTL(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual MSGCTL(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME msgctl - XSI message control operations</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/msg.h&gt;</p>

<p>int msgctl(int msqid, int cmd, struct msqid_ds
*buf);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The msgctl() function operates on XSI
message queues (see the Base Def- initions volume of IEEE
Std 1003.1-2001, Section 3.224, Message Queue). It is
unspecified whether this function interoperates with the
realtime interprocess communication facilities defined in
Realtime .</p>

<p>The msgctl() function shall provide message control
operations as spec- ified by cmd. The following values for
cmd, and the message control operations they specify,
are:</p>

<p>IPC_STAT Place the current value of each member of the
msqid_ds data structure associated with msqid into the
structure pointed to by buf. The contents of this structure
are defined in &lt;sys/msg.h&gt;.</p>

<p>IPC_SET Set the value of the following members of the
msqid_ds data structure associated with msqid to the
corresponding value found in the structure pointed to by
buf:</p>

<p>msg_perm.uid msg_perm.gid msg_perm.mode msg_qbytes</p>

<p>IPC_SET can only be executed by a process with
appropriate privileges or that has an effective user ID
equal to the value of msg_perm.cuid or msg_perm.uid in the
msqid_ds data structure associated with msqid. Only a
process with appropriate privileges can raise the value of
msg_qbytes.</p>

<p>IPC_RMID Remove the message queue identifier specified
by msqid from the system and destroy the message queue and
msqid_ds data structure associated with it. IPC_RMD can only
be executed by a process with appropriate privileges or one
that has an effective user ID equal to the value of
msg_perm.cuid or msg_perm.uid in the msqid_ds data structure
associated with msqid.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, msgctl() shall
return 0; otherwise, it shall return -1 and set errno to
indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The msgctl() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EACCES The argument cmd is IPC_STAT and the calling
process does not have read permission; see XSI Interprocess
Communication .</p>

<p>EINVAL The value of msqid is not a valid message queue
identifier; or the value of cmd is not a valid command.</p>

<p>EPERM The argument cmd is IPC_RMID or IPC_SET and the
effective user ID of the calling process is not equal to
that of a process with appropriate privileges and it is not
equal to the value of msg_perm.cuid or msg_perm.uid in the
data structure associated with msqid.</p>

<p>EPERM The argument cmd is IPC_SET, an attempt is being
made to increase to the value of msg_qbytes, and the
effective user ID of the calling process does not have
appropriate privileges.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The POSIX Realtime Extension defines
alternative interfaces for inter- process communication
(IPC). Application developers who need to use IPC should
design their applications so that modules using the IPC
routines described in XSI Interprocess Communication can be
easily modified to use the alternative interfaces.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
