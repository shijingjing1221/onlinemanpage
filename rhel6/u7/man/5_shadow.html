<p>NAME shadow - shadowed password file</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION shadow is a file which contains the password
information for the system&acute;s accounts and optional
aging information.</p>

<p>This file must not be readable by regular users if
password security is to be maintained.</p>

<p>Each line of this file contains 9 fields, separated by
colons (:), in the following order:</p>

<p>login name It must be a valid account name, which exist
on the system.</p>

<p>encrypted password Refer to crypt(3) for details on how
this string is interpreted.</p>

<p>If the password field contains some string that is not a
valid result of crypt(3), for instance ! or *, the user will
not be able to use a unix password to log in (but the user
may log in the system by other means).</p>

<p>This field may be empty, in which case no passwords are
required to authenticate as the specified login name.
However, some applications which read the /etc/shadow file
may decide not to permit any access at all if the password
field is empty.</p>

<p>A password field which starts with a exclamation mark
means that the password is locked. The remaining characters
on the line represent the password field before the password
was locked.</p>

<p>date of last password change The date of the last
password change, expressed as the number of days since Jan
1, 1970.</p>

<p>The value 0 has a special meaning, which is that the
user should change her pasword the next time she will log in
the system.</p>

<p>An empty field means that password aging features are
disabled.</p>

<p>minimum password age The minimum password age is the
number of days the user will have to wait before she will be
allowed to change her password again.</p>

<p>An empty field and value 0 mean that there are no
minimum password age.</p>

<p>maximum password age The maximum password age is the
number of days after which the user will have to change her
password.</p>

<p>After this number of days is elapsed, the password may
still be valid. The user should be asked to change her
password the next time she will log in.</p>

<p>An empty field means that there are no maximum password
age, no password warning period, and no password inactivity
period (see below).</p>

<p>If the maximum password age is lower than the minimum
password age, the user cannot change her password.</p>

<p>password warning period The number of days before a
password is going to expire (see the maximum password age
above) during which the user should be warned.</p>

<p>An empty field and value 0 mean that there are no
password warning period.</p>

<p>password inactivity period The number of days after a
password has expired (see the maximum password age above)
during which the password should still be accepted (and the
user should update her password during the next login).</p>

<p>After expiration of the password and this expiration
period is elapsed, no login is possible using the current
user&acute;s password. The user should contact her
administrator.</p>

<p>An empty field means that there are no enforcement of an
inactivity period.</p>

<p>account expiration date The date of expiration of the
account, expressed as the number of days since Jan 1,
1970.</p>

<p>Note that an account expiration differs from a password
expiration. In case of an acount expiration, the user shall
not be allowed to login. In case of a password expiration,
the user is not allowed to login using her password.</p>

<p>An empty field means that the account will never
expire.</p>

<p>The value 0 should not be used as it is interpreted as
either an account with no expiration, or as an expiration on
Jan 1, 1970.</p>

<p>reserved field This field is reserved for future
use.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/passwd User account information.</p>

<p>/etc/shadow Secure user account information.</p>

<p>/etc/shadow- Backup file for /etc/shadow.</p>

<p>Note that this file is used by the tools of the shadow
toolsuite, but not by all user and password management
tools.</p>
