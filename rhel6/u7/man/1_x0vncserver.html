<p>X0VNCSERVER(1) TigerVNC Manual X0VNCSERVER(1)</p>

<p>NAME x0vncserver - TigerVNC Server for X displays</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS x0vncserver [options] x0vncserver -version</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION x0vncserver is a TigerVNC Server which makes
any X display remotely accessible via VNC, TigerVNC or
compatible viewers. Unlike Xvnc(1), it does not create a
virtual display. Instead, it just shares an existing X
server (typically, that one connected to the physical
screen).</p>

<p>OPTIONS x0vncserver interprets the command line as a
list of parameters with optional values. Running x0vncserver
-h will show a list of all valid parameters with short
descriptions. All parameters are optional, but normally you
would have to use the PasswordFile parameter (see its
description below).</p>

<p>There are several forms of specifying parameters in the
command line (here we use SomeParameter as an example
parameter name):</p>

<p>-SomeParameter Enable the parameter, turn the feature
on. This form can be used with parameters that simply enable
or disable some feature.</p>

<p>-SomeParameter=0 Disable the parameter, turn the feature
off.</p>

<p>-SomeParameter=value Assign the specified value to the
parameter. The leading dash can be omitted, or it can be
doubled if desired (like in GNU- style long options).</p>

<p>Parameter names are case-insensitive, their order in the
command line can be arbitrary.</p>

<p>PARAMETERS display The X display name. If not specified,
it defaults to the value of the DISPLAY environment
variable.</p>

<p>rfbport TCP port to listen for incoming VNC connections
(RFB protocol). The default port is 5900.</p>

<p>Log Specifies which log output should be directed to
which target logger, and the level of output to log. Format
is log:tar- get:level. Default is *:stderr:30 (log
everything to stderr, set log level to 30). Log level should
be a value between 0 and 100, higher levels produce more
output.</p>

<p>HostsFile This parameter allows to specify a file name
with IP access con- trol rules. The file should include one
rule per line, and the rule format is one of the following:
+address/netmask (accept connections from the specified
address group), -address/netmask (reject connections) or
?address/netmask (query the local user). The first rule
matching the IP address determines the action to be
performed. Rules that include only an action sign (+, - or
?) will match any IP address. Netmask is optional and can be
specified either in dotted format (e.g. /255.255.255.0), or
as a single number of bits (e.g. /24). Default is to accept
connec- tions from any IP address.</p>

<p>SecurityTypes Specify which security scheme to use for
incoming connections. Valid values are None and VncAuth.
Default is VncAuth.</p>

<p>PasswordFile Password file for VNC authentication. There
is no default, you should specify the password file
explicitly. Password file should be created with the
vncpasswd(1) utility.</p>

<p>Password Obfuscated binary encoding of the password
which clients must supply to access the server. Using this
parameter is insecure, use PasswordFile parameter
instead.</p>

<p>BlacklistThreshold The number of unauthenticated
connection attempts allowed from any individual host before
that host is black-listed. Default is 5.</p>

<p>BlacklistTimeout The initial timeout applied when a host
is first black-listed. The host cannot re-attempt a
connection until the timeout expires. Default is 10.</p>

<p>QueryConnect Prompt the local user to accept or reject
incoming connections. Default is off.</p>

<p>QueryConnectTimeout Number of seconds to show the Accept
Connection dialog before rejecting the connection. Default
is 10.</p>

<p>AlwaysShared Always treat incoming connections as
shared, regardless of the client-specified setting. Default
is off.</p>

<p>NeverShared Never treat incoming connections as shared,
regardless of the client-specified setting. Default is
off.</p>

<p>DisconnectClients Disconnect existing clients if an
incoming connection is non- shared. If combined with
NeverShared then new connections will be refused while there
is a client active. Default is on.</p>

<p>AcceptKeyEvents Accept key press and release events from
clients. Default is on.</p>

<p>AcceptPointerEvents Accept pointer events from clients.
Default is on.</p>

<p>RemapKeys Comma-separated list of incoming keysyms to
remap. Mappings are expressed as two hex values, prefixed by
0x, and separated by -&gt; (dash and greater than
characters).</p>

<p>Protocol3.3 Always use RFB protocol version 3.3 for
backwards compatibility with badly-behaved clients. Default
is off.</p>

<p>Geometry This option specifies the screen area that will
be shown to VNC clients. The format is
widthxheight+xoffset+yoffset , where + signs can be replaced
with - signs to specify offsets from the right and/or from
the bottom of the screen. Offsets are optional, +0+0 is
assumed by default (top left corner). If the argument is
empty, full screen is shown to VNC clients (this is the
default).</p>

<p>MaxProcessorUsage Maximum percentage of CPU time to be
consumed when polling the screen. Default is 35.</p>

<p>PollingCycle Milliseconds per one polling cycle. Actual
interval may be dynamically adjusted to satisfy
MaxProcessorUsage setting. Default is 30.</p>

<p>VideoArea This option specifies the screen area that
will be handled as video. The format is
widthxheight+xoffset+yoffset , where + signs can be replaced
with - signs to specify offsets from the right and/or from
the bottom of the screen. Offsets are optional, +0+0 is
assumed by default (top left corner). Video area is not
checked for actual changes, it is assumed to be changing
continuously and is sent in each screen update. Nor- mally,
video area is compressed with JPEG (if allowed by the
client). Note that this setting can be overriden by TigerVNC
clients supporting VideoRectangleSelection protocol
extension. In other words, clients may choose video
selection themselves, but if they do not, then the VideoArea
parameter will take effect. If the argument is empty, no
video area is set (this is the default).</p>

<p>VideoPriority Specify the priority of sending video
updates. x0vncserver can be instructed to treat certain
rectangular part of the screen as a video area and handle it
in a special way for improved perfor- mance (see
documentation on the VideoArea parameter). VideoPri- ority
value controls how often video area will be sent to clients
as compared to the rest of the screen. The priority must be
an integer between 0 and 8, and the default value is 2.</p>

<p>VideoPriority set to 1 gives the same priority both to
video and to other pixels. Higher values give more priority
to video. For example, the value 5 specifies that the rate
of sending video will be five times higher than the rate of
updating the rest of the screen. If VideoPriority is set to
0, it gives equal priority to video and other updates (just
like the value 1) and also disables special encoding for
video data. In other words, VideoPriority video area will be
sent as a part of other screen contents.</p>

<p>CompareFB Perform pixel comparison on framebuffer to
reduce unnecessary updates. Default is on.</p>

<p>UseSHM Use MIT-SHM extension if available. Using that
extension accel- erates reading the screen. Default is
on.</p>

<p>OverlayMode Use overlay mode in IRIX or Solaris (does
not have effect in other systems). This enables
system-specific access to complete full-color version of the
screen (the default X visual often provides 256 colors).
Also, in overlay mode, x0vncserver can show correct mouse
cursor. Default is on.</p>

<p>UseHardwareJPEG Use hardware-accelerated JPEG compressor
for video if available. x0vncserver can be instructed to
treat certain rectangular part of the screen as a video area
and handle it in a special way for improved performance. If
the client supports Tight encoding and JPEG compression,
such video areas will be sent as JPEG-encoded rectangles.
And if this option is on, compression will be hard-
ware-accelerated (currently, supported only in SGI/IRIX
equipped with appropriate hardware). Default is on.</p>

<p>ZlibLevel Zlib compression level for ZRLE encoding (it
does not affect Tight encoding). Acceptable values are
between 0 and 9. Default is to use the standard compression
level provided by the zlib(3) compression library.</p>

<p>ImprovedHextile Use improved compression algorithm for
Hextile encoding which achieves better compression ratios by
the cost of using slightly more CPU time. Default is on.</p>

<p>IdleTimeout The number of seconds after which an idle
VNC connection will be dropped (zero means no timeout).
Default is 0.</p>

<p>MaxDisconnectionTime Terminate when no client has been
connected for N seconds. Default is 0.</p>

<p>MaxConnectionTime Terminate when a client has been
connected for N seconds. Default is 0.</p>

<p>MaxIdleTime Terminate after N seconds of user
inactivity. Default is 0.</p>

<p>ClientWaitTimeMillis The number of milliseconds to wait
for a client which is no longer responding. Default is
20000.</p>
