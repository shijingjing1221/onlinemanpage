<p>NAME vfs_catia - translate illegal characters in Catia
filenames</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS vfs objects = catia</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This VFS module is part of the samba(7)
suite.</p>

<p>The Catia CAD package commonly creates filenames that
use characters that are illegal in CIFS filenames. The
vfs_catia VFS module implements a character mapping so that
these files can be shared with CIFS clients.</p>

<p>This module is stackable.</p>

<p>Up to samba version 3.4.x a fixed character mapping was
used. The invalid windows characters / : * ? &quot; &lt;
&gt; | and the blank character were mapped in a hardcoded
way.</p>

<p>Starting with samba-3.5.0 a more flexible mapping was
introduced. The new parameter &quot;catia:mappings&quot; now
specifies the mapping on a char by char basis using the
notation: unix hex char 0x.. : windows hex char 0x..
Multiple character mappings are separated by a comma.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Samba versions up to 3.4.x:</p>

<p>Map Catia filenames on the [CAD] share:</p>

<p>[CAD] path = /data/cad vfs objects = catia</p>

<p>Samba versions 3.5.0 and later:</p>

<p>Map Catia filenames on the [CAD] share:</p>

<p>[CAD] path = /data/cad vfs objects = catia
catia:mappings = 0x22:0xa8</p>

<p>To get the full formerly fixed mappings:</p>

<p>[CAD] path = /data/cad vfs objects = catia
catia:mappings =
0x22:0xa8,0x2a:0xa4,0x2f:0xf8,0x3a:0xf7,0x3c:0xab,0x3e:0xbb,0x3f:0xbf,0x5c:0xff,0x7c:0xa6,0x20:0xb1</p>

<p>Unix filename to be translated (Note that the path
delimiter &quot;/&quot; is not used here):</p>

<p>a:a*a?a&quot;a&lt;a&gt;a|a a</p>

<p>Resulting windows filename:</p>


<p>a&yuml;a&divide;a&curren;a&iquest;a&uml;a&laquo;a&raquo;a&brvbar;a&plusmn;a</p>

<p>Note that the character mapping must work in BOTH
directions (unix -&gt; windows and windows -&gt; unix) to
get unique and existing file names!</p>

<p>A NOT working example:</p>

<p>[CAD] path = /data/cad vfs objects = catia
catia:mappings = 0x3a:0x5f</p>

<p>Here the colon &quot;:&quot; is mapped to the underscore
&quot;_&quot;.</p>

<p>Assuming a unix filename &quot;a:should_work&quot;,
which is well translated to windows as
&quot;a_should_work&quot;.</p>

<p>BUT the reverse mapping from windows
&quot;a_should_work&quot; to unix will result in
&quot;a:should:work&quot; - something like &quot;file not
found&quot; will be returned.</p>

<p>VERSION This man page is correct for all versions up to
4.0.3 of the Samba suite.</p>

<p>AUTHOR The original Samba software and related utilities
were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by
the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way
the Linux kernel is developed.</p>
