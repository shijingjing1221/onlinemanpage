<p>NAME XmClipboardInquireFormat A clipboard function that
returns a speci- fied format name</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;Xm/CutPaste.h&gt; int
XmClipboardInquireFormat (display, window, index,
format_name_buf, buffer_len, copied_len) Display * display;
Window window; int index; XtPointer format_name_buf;
unsigned long buffer_len; unsigned long * copied_len;
(void)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION XmClipboardInquireFormat returns a specified
format name for the data item in the clipboard. If the name
must be truncated, the function returns a warning
status.</p>

<p>display Specifies a pointer to the Display structure
that was returned in a previous call to XOpenDisplay or
XtDisplay.</p>

<p>window Specifies the window ID of a widget that relates
the applica- tion window to the clipboard. The widgets
window ID can be obtained through XtWindow. The same
application instance should pass the same window ID to each
of the clipboard func- tions that it calls.</p>

<p>index Specifies which of the ordered format names to
obtain. If this index is greater than the number of formats
for the data item, this function returns a 0 (zero) in the
copied_len argument.</p>

<p>format_name_buf Specifies the buffer that receives the
format name.</p>

<p>buffer_len Specifies the number of bytes in the format
name buffer.</p>

<p>copied_len Specifies the number of bytes in the data
item copied to the buffer. If this argument equals 0 (zero),
there is no nth format for the data item.</p>

<p>RETURN XmClipboardSuccess The function was
successful.</p>

<p>XmClipboardLocked The function failed because the
clipboard was locked by another application. The application
can continue to call the function again with the same
parameters until the lock goes away. This gives the
application the opportunity to ask if the user wants to keep
trying or to give up on the operation.</p>

<p>XmClipboardTruncate The data returned is truncated
because the user did not pro- vide a buffer large enough to
hold the data.</p>

<p>XmClipboardNoData The function could not find data on
the clipboard correspond- ing to the format requested. This
could occur because the clipboard is empty; there is data on
the clipboard, but not in the requested format; or the data
in the requested format was passed by name and is no longer
available.</p>
