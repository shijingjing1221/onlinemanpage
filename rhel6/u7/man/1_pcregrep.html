<p>PCREGREP(1) PCREGREP(1)</p>

<p>NAME pcregrep - a grep with Perl-compatible regular
expressions.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pcregrep [options] [long options] [pattern]
[path1 path2 ...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION</p>

<p>pcregrep searches files for character patterns, in the
same way as other grep commands do, but it uses the PCRE
regular expression library to support patterns that are
compatible with the regular expressions of Perl 5. See
pcresyntax(3) for a quick-reference summary of syntax or
pcrepattern(3) for a full description of syntax and
semantics of the regular expressions that PCRE supports.</p>

<p>Patterns, whether supplied on the command line or in a
separate file, are given without delimiters. For
example:</p>

<p>pcregrep Thursday /etc/motd</p>

<p>If you attempt to use delimiters (for example, by
surrounding a pattern with slashes, as is common in Perl
scripts), they are interpreted as part of the pattern.
Quotes can of course be used to delimit patterns on the
command line because they are interpreted by the shell, and
indeed they are required if a pattern contains white space
or shell metacharacters.</p>

<p>The first argument that follows any option settings is
treated as the single pattern to be matched when neither -e
nor -f is present. Con- versely, when one or both of these
options are used to specify pat- terns, all arguments are
treated as path names. At least one of -e, -f, or an
argument pattern must be provided.</p>

<p>If no files are specified, pcregrep reads the standard
input. The stan- dard input can also be referenced by a name
consisting of a single hyphen. For example:</p>

<p>pcregrep some-pattern /file1 - /file3</p>

<p>By default, each line that matches a pattern is copied
to the standard output, and if there is more than one file,
the file name is output at the start of each line, followed
by a colon. However, there are options that can change how
pcregrep behaves. In particular, the -M option makes it
possible to search for patterns that span line boundaries.
What defines a line boundary is controlled by the -N
(--newline) option.</p>

<p>Patterns are limited to 8K or BUFSIZ characters,
whichever is the greater. BUFSIZ is defined in
&lt;stdio.h&gt;. When there is more than one pattern
(specified by the use of -e and/or -f), each pattern is
applied to each line in the order in which they are defined,
except that all the -e patterns are tried before the -f
patterns. As soon as one pat- tern matches (or fails to
match when -v is used), no further patterns are
considered.</p>

<p>When --only-matching, --file-offsets, or --line-offsets
is used, the output is the part of the line that matched
(either shown literally, or as an offset). In this case,
scanning resumes immediately following the match, so that
further matches on the same line can be found. If there are
multiple patterns, they are all tried on the remainder of
the line. However, patterns that follow the one that matched
are not tried on the earlier part of the line.</p>

<p>If the LC_ALL or LC_CTYPE environment variable is set,
pcregrep uses the value to set a locale when calling the
PCRE library. The --locale option can be used to override
this.</p>

<p>SUPPORT FOR COMPRESSED FILES</p>

<p>It is possible to compile pcregrep so that it uses libz
or libbz2 to read files whose names end in .gz or .bz2,
respectively. You can find out whether your binary has
support for one or both of these file types by running it
with the --help option. If the appropriate support is not
present, files are treated as plain text. The standard input
is always so treated.</p>

<p>OPTIONS</p>

<p>-- This terminate the list of options. It is useful if
the next item on the command line starts with a hyphen but
is not an option. This allows for the processing of patterns
and file- names that start with hyphens.</p>

<p>-A number, --after-context=number Output number lines of
context after each matching line. If filenames and/or line
numbers are being output, a hyphen sep- arator is used
instead of a colon for the context lines. A line containing
&quot;--&quot; is output between each group of lines, unless
they are in fact contiguous in the input file. The value of
number is expected to be relatively small. However, pcregrep
guarantees to have up to 8K of following text avail- able
for context output.</p>

<p>-B number, --before-context=number Output number lines
of context before each matching line. If filenames and/or
line numbers are being output, a hyphen sep- arator is used
instead of a colon for the context lines. A line containing
&quot;--&quot; is output between each group of lines, unless
they are in fact contiguous in the input file. The value of
number is expected to be relatively small. However, pcregrep
guarantees to have up to 8K of preceding text avail- able
for context output.</p>

<p>-C number, --context=number Output number lines of
context both before and after each matching line. This is
equivalent to setting both -A and -B to the same value.</p>

<p>-c, --count Do not output individual lines; instead just
output a count of the number of lines that would otherwise
have been output. If several files are given, a count is
output for each of them. In this mode, the -A, -B, and -C
options are ignored.</p>

<p>--colour, --color If this option is given without any
data, it is equivalent to &quot;--colour=auto&quot;. If data
is required, it must be given in the same shell item,
separated by an equals sign.</p>

<p>--colour=value, --color=value This option specifies
under what circumstances the part of a line that matched a
pattern should be coloured in the output. The value may be
&quot;never&quot; (the default), &quot;always&quot;, or
&quot;auto&quot;. In the latter case, colouring happens only
if the standard output is connected to a terminal. The
colour can be speci- fied by setting the environment
variable PCREGREP_COLOUR or PCREGREP_COLOR. The value of
this variable should be a string of two numbers, separated
by a semicolon. They are copied directly into the control
string for setting colour on a ter- minal, so it is your
responsibility to ensure that they make sense. If neither of
the environment variables is set, the default is
&quot;1;31&quot;, which gives red.</p>

<p>-D action, --devices=action If an input path is not a
regular file or a directory, &quot;action&quot; specifies
how it is to be processed. Valid values are &quot;read&quot;
(the default) or &quot;skip&quot; (silently skip the
path).</p>

<p>-d action, --directories=action If an input path is a
directory, &quot;action&quot; specifies how it is to be
processed. Valid values are &quot;read&quot; (the default),
&quot;recurse&quot; (equivalent to the -r option), or
&quot;skip&quot; (silently skip the path). In the default
case, directories are read as if they were ordinary files.
In some operating systems the effect of reading a directory
like this is an immediate end- of-file.</p>

<p>-e pattern, --regex=pattern, --regexp=pattern Specify a
pattern to be matched. This option can be used mul- tiple
times in order to specify several patterns. It can also be
used as a way of specifying a single pattern that starts
with a hyphen. When -e is used, no argument pattern is taken
from the command line; all arguments are treated as file
names. There is an overall maximum of 100 patterns. They are
applied to each line in the order in which they are defined
until one matches (or fails to match if -v is used). If -f
is used with -e, the command line patterns are matched
first, followed by the patterns from the file, independent
of the order in which these options are specified. Note that
multi- ple use of -e is not the same as a single pattern
with alter- natives. For example, X|Y finds the first
character in a line that is X or Y, whereas if the two
patterns are given sepa- rately, pcregrep finds X if it is
present, even if it follows Y in the line. It finds Y only
if there is no X in the line. This really matters only if
you are using -o to show the part(s) of the line that
matched.</p>

<p>--exclude=pattern When pcregrep is searching the files
in a directory as a con- sequence of the -r (recursive
search) option, any regular files whose names match the
pattern are excluded. Subdirecto- ries are not excluded by
this option; they are searched recursively, subject to the
--exclude_dir and --include_dir options. The pattern is a
PCRE regular expression, and is matched against the final
component of the file name (not the entire path). If a file
name matches both --include and --exclude, it is excluded.
There is no short form for this option.</p>

<p>--exclude_dir=pattern When pcregrep is searching the
contents of a directory as a consequence of the -r
(recursive search) option, any subdi- rectories whose names
match the pattern are excluded. (Note that the --exclude
option does not affect subdirectories.) The pattern is a
PCRE regular expression, and is matched against the final
component of the name (not the entire path). If a
subdirectory name matches both --include_dir and
--exclude_dir, it is excluded. There is no short form for
this option.</p>

<p>-F, --fixed-strings Interpret each pattern as a list of
fixed strings, separated by newlines, instead of as a
regular expression. The -w (match as a word) and -x (match
whole line) options can be used with -F. They apply to each
of the fixed strings. A line is selected if any of the fixed
strings are found in it (sub- ject to -w or -x, if
present).</p>

<p>-f filename, --file=filename Read a number of patterns
from the file, one per line, and match them against each
line of input. A data line is output if any of the patterns
match it. The filename can be given as &quot;-&quot; to
refer to the standard input. When -f is used, patterns
specified on the command line using -e may also be present;
they are tested before the file s patterns. However, no
other pattern is taken from the command line; all arguments
are treated as file names. There is an overall maximum of
100 patterns. Trailing white space is removed from each
line, and blank lines are ignored. An empty file contains no
patterns and therefore matches nothing. See also the
comments about multiple patterns versus a single pattern
with alternatives in the description of -e above.</p>

<p>--file-offsets Instead of showing lines or parts of
lines that match, show each match as an offset from the
start of the file and a length, separated by a comma. In
this mode, no context is shown. That is, the -A, -B, and -C
options are ignored. If there is more than one match in a
line, each of them is shown separately. This option is
mutually exclusive with --line- offsets and
--only-matching.</p>

<p>-H, --with-filename Force the inclusion of the filename
at the start of output lines when searching a single file.
By default, the filename is not shown in this case. For
matching lines, the filename is followed by a colon and a
space; for context lines, a hyphen separator is used. If a
line number is also being out- put, it follows the file name
without a space.</p>

<p>-h, --no-filename Suppress the output filenames when
searching multiple files. By default, filenames are shown
when multiple files are searched. For matching lines, the
filename is followed by a colon and a space; for context
lines, a hyphen separator is used. If a line number is also
being output, it follows the file name without a space.</p>

<p>--help Output a help message, giving brief details of
the command options and file type support, and then
exit.</p>

<p>-i, --ignore-case Ignore upper/lower case distinctions
during comparisons.</p>

<p>--include=pattern When pcregrep is searching the files
in a directory as a con- sequence of the -r (recursive
search) option, only those reg- ular files whose names match
the pattern are included. Subdi- rectories are always
included and searched recursively, sub- ject to the
--include_dir and --exclude_dir options. The pat- tern is a
PCRE regular expression, and is matched against the final
component of the file name (not the entire path). If a file
name matches both --include and --exclude, it is excluded.
There is no short form for this option.</p>

<p>--include_dir=pattern When pcregrep is searching the
contents of a directory as a consequence of the -r
(recursive search) option, only those subdirectories whose
names match the pattern are included. (Note that the
--include option does not affect subdirectories.) The
pattern is a PCRE regular expression, and is matched against
the final component of the name (not the entire path). If a
subdirectory name matches both --include_dir and
--exclude_dir, it is excluded. There is no short form for
this option.</p>

<p>-L, --files-without-match Instead of outputting lines
from the files, just output the names of the files that do
not contain any lines that would have been output. Each file
name is output once, on a sepa- rate line.</p>

<p>-l, --files-with-matches Instead of outputting lines
from the files, just output the names of the files
containing lines that would have been out- put. Each file
name is output once, on a separate line. Searching stops as
soon as a matching line is found in a file.</p>

<p>--label=name This option supplies a name to be used for
the standard input when file names are being output. If not
supplied, &quot;(standard input)&quot; is used. There is no
short form for this option.</p>

<p>--line-offsets Instead of showing lines or parts of
lines that match, show each match as a line number, the
offset from the start of the line, and a length. The line
number is terminated by a colon (as usual; see the -n
option), and the offset and length are separated by a comma.
In this mode, no context is shown. That is, the -A, -B, and
-C options are ignored. If there is more than one match in a
line, each of them is shown sepa- rately. This option is
mutually exclusive with --file-offsets and
--only-matching.</p>

<p>--locale=locale-name This option specifies a locale to
be used for pattern match- ing. It overrides the value in
the LC_ALL or LC_CTYPE envi- ronment variables. If no locale
is specified, the PCRE library s default (usually the
&quot;C&quot; locale) is used. There is no short form for
this option.</p>

<p>-M, --multiline Allow patterns to match more than one
line. When this option is given, patterns may usefully
contain literal newline char- acters and internal
occurrences of ^ and $ characters. The output for any one
match may consist of more than one line. When this option is
set, the PCRE library is called in &quot;mul- tiline&quot;
mode. There is a limit to the number of lines that can be
matched, imposed by the way that pcregrep buffers the input
file as it scans it. However, pcregrep ensures that at least
8K characters or the rest of the document (whichever is the
shorter) are available for forward matching, and simi- larly
the previous 8K characters (or all the previous charac-
ters, if fewer than 8K) are guaranteed to be available for
lookbehind assertions.</p>

<p>-N newline-type, --newline=newline-type The PCRE library
supports five different conventions for indicating the ends
of lines. They are the single-character sequences CR
(carriage return) and LF (linefeed), the two- character
sequence CRLF, an &quot;anycrlf&quot; convention, which rec-
ognizes any of the preceding three types, and an
&quot;any&quot; con- vention, in which any Unicode line
ending sequence is assumed to end a line. The Unicode
sequences are the three just men- tioned, plus VT (vertical
tab, U+000B), FF (form feed, U+000C), NEL (next line,
U+0085), LS (line separator, U+2028), and PS (paragraph
separator, U+2029).</p>

<p>When the PCRE library is built, a default line-ending
sequence is specified. This is normally the standard
sequence for the operating system. Unless otherwise
specified by this option, pcregrep uses the library s
default. The possible values for this option are CR, LF,
CRLF, ANYCRLF, or ANY. This makes it possible to use
pcregrep on files that have come from other environments
without having to modify their line endings. If the data
that is being scanned does not agree with the convention set
by this option, pcregrep may behave in strange ways.</p>

<p>-n, --line-number Precede each output line by its line
number in the file, fol- lowed by a colon and a space for
matching lines or a hyphen and a space for context lines. If
the filename is also being output, it precedes the line
number. This option is forced if --line-offsets is used.</p>

<p>-o, --only-matching Show only the part of the line that
matched a pattern. In this mode, no context is shown. That
is, the -A, -B, and -C options are ignored. If there is more
than one match in a line, each of them is shown separately.
If -o is combined with -v (invert the sense of the match to
find non-matching lines), no output is generated, but the
return code is set appropriately. This option is mutually
exclusive with --file- offsets and --line-offsets.</p>

<p>-q, --quiet Work quietly, that is, display nothing
except error messages. The exit status indicates whether or
not any matches were found.</p>

<p>-r, --recursive If any given path is a directory,
recursively scan the files it contains, taking note of any
--include and --exclude set- tings. By default, a directory
is read as a normal file; in some operating systems this
gives an immediate end-of-file. This option is a shorthand
for setting the -d option to &quot;recurse&quot;.</p>

<p>-s, --no-messages Suppress error messages about
non-existent or unreadable files. Such files are quietly
skipped. However, the return code is still 2, even if
matches were found in other files.</p>

<p>-u, --utf-8 Operate in UTF-8 mode. This option is
available only if PCRE has been compiled with UTF-8 support.
Both patterns and sub- ject lines must be valid strings of
UTF-8 characters.</p>

<p>-V, --version Write the version numbers of pcregrep and
the PCRE library that is being used to the standard error
stream.</p>

<p>-v, --invert-match Invert the sense of the match, so
that lines which do not match any of the patterns are the
ones that are found.</p>

<p>-w, --word-regex, --word-regexp Force the patterns to
match only whole words. This is equiva- a lent to having
tthe start and end of the pattern.</p>

<p>-x, --line-regex, --line-regexp Force the patterns to be
anchored (each must start matching at the beginning of a
line) and in addition, require them to match entire lines.
This is equivalent to having ^ and $ characters at the start
and end of each alternative branch in every pattern.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</p>

<p>The environment variables LC_ALL and LC_CTYPE are
examined, in that order, for a locale. The first one that is
set is used. This can be overridden by the --locale option.
If no locale is set, the PCRE librarys default (usually the
&quot;C&quot; locale) is used.</p>

<p>NEWLINES</p>

<p>The -N (--newline) option allows pcregrep to scan files
with different newline conventions from the default.
However, the setting of this option does not affect the way
in which pcregrep writes information to the standard error
and output streams. It uses the string &quot;0 in C printf()
calls to indicate newlines, relying on the C I/O library to
convert this to an appropriate sequence if the output is
sent to a file.</p>

<p>OPTIONS COMPATIBILITY</p>

<p>The majority of short and long forms of pcregreps
options are the same as in the GNU grep program. Any long
option of the form --xxx-regexp (GNU terminology) is also
available as --xxx-regex (PCRE terminology). However, the
--locale, -M, --multiline, -u, and --utf-8 options are
specific to pcregrep.</p>

<p>OPTIONS WITH DATA</p>

<p>There are four different ways in which an option with
data can be spec- ified. If a short form option is used, the
data may follow immedi- ately, or in the next command line
item. For example:</p>

<p>-f/some/file -f /some/file</p>

<p>If a long form option is used, the data may appear in
the same command line item, separated by an equals
character, or (with one exception) it may appear in the next
command line item. For example:</p>

<p>--file=/some/file --file /some/file</p>

<p>Note, however, that if you want to supply a file name
beginning with ~ as data in a shell command, and have the
shell expand ~ to a home directory, you must separate the
file name from the option, because the shell does not treat
~ specially unless it is at the start of an item.</p>

<p>The exception to the above is the --colour (or --color)
option, for which the data is optional. If this option does
have data, it must be given in the first form, using an
equals character. Otherwise it will be assumed that it has
no data.</p>

<p>MATCHING ERRORS</p>

<p>It is possible to supply a regular expression that takes
a very long time to fail to match certain lines. Such
patterns normally involve nested indefinite repeats, for
example: (a+)* when matched against a line of a s with no
final digit. The PCRE matching function has a resource limit
that causes it to abort in these circumstances. If this
happens, pcregrep outputs an error message and the line that
caused the problem to the standard error stream. If there
are more than 20 such errors, pcregrep gives up.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS</p>

<p>Exit status is 0 if any matches were found, 1 if no
matches were found, and 2 for syntax errors and non-existent
or inaccessible files (even if matches were found in other
files) or too many matching errors. Using the -s option to
suppress error messages about inaccessible files does not
affect the return code.</p>
