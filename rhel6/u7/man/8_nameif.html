<p>NAMEIF(8) Linux s Administrator s Manual NAMEIF(8)</p>

<p>NAME nameif - name network interfaces based on MAC
addresses</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS nameif [-c configfile] [-s] nameif [-c
configfile] [-s] {interface macaddress}</p>

<p>NOTE This program is obsolete. For replacement check ip
link. This func- tionality is also much better provided by
udev methods.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION nameif renames network interfaces based on
mac addresses. When no argu- ments are given /etc/mactab is
read. Each line of it contains an interface name and a
Ethernet MAC address. Comments are allowed start- ing with
#. Otherwise the interfaces specified on the command line
are processed. nameif looks for the interface with the given
MAC address and renames it to the name given.</p>

<p>When the -s argument is given all error messages go to
the syslog.</p>

<p>When the -c argument is given with a file name that file
is read instead of /etc/mactab.</p>

<p>NOTES nameif should be run before the interface is up,
otherwise itll fail.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/mactab</p>

<p>SEE ALSO ip(8), udev(7)</p>

<p>BUGS Only works for Ethernet currently.</p>
