<p>NAME wbemexec - submit a CIM operation request to a CIM
Server</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS wbemexec [ -h hostname ] [ -p portnumber ] [ -v
httpversion ] [ -m httpmethod ] [ -t timeout ] [ -u username
] [ -w password ] [ -s ] [ --help ] [ --version ] [
inputfilepath ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The wbemexec command provides a command line
interface to a CIM Server. The input to the command consists
of a CIM request encoded in XML. The request is submitted to
the CIM Server for execution. If the HTTP response from the
CIM Server contains a status code of 200 (OK), the result
returned to stdout is the CIM response encoded in XML.
Other- wise, the result returned to stdout is the HTTP
response. Some types of invalid XML requests (e.g. missing
PROTOCOLVERSION attribute or missing NAME attribute) are
detected by wbemexec, and result in an error message from
wbemexec. Other invalid XML requests (e.g. invalid
CIMVERSION attribute value or missing XML version), are
detected by the CIM Server, and result in an HTTP response,
containing a non-Success status code, such as 501 (Not
Implemented) or 400 (Bad Request).</p>

<p>By default, the request is sent as an HTTP/1.1 request,
using the HTTP M-POST method, and wbemexec waits 20000
milliseconds (20 seconds), then times out if a response
hasnt been received. Input is read from stdin, if no input
file is specified.</p>

<p>By default, the operation is executed on the local host.
wbemexec first attempts to connect to the CIM Server on the
default port for the wbem-http service, and if that fails,
another attempt is made on the default port for the
wbem-https service.</p>

<p>Options wbemexec recognizes the following options:</p>

<p>-h hostname Connect to the CIM Server on the specified
host. If this option is not specified, wbemexec con- nects
to the local host.</p>

<p>--help Display command usage information.</p>

<p>-m httpmethod Use the specified HTTP method for the
request. The method must be &quot;POST&quot; or
&quot;M-POST&quot;.</p>

<p>-p portnumber Connect to the CIM Server on the specified
port number. If this option is not specified, wbe- mexec
connects to the default port for the wbem-http service, or
if the -s option is speci- fied, to the default port for the
wbem-https ser- vice.</p>

<p>-s Enable the use of the SSL protocol between and the
CIM server. The -s option should be speci- fied if the CIM
Server on the specified host- name/portnumber expects
clients to connect using HTTPS.</p>

<p>-t timeout Wait the specified number of milliseconds on
sending a request, before timing out if no response has been
received. The timeout value must be an integer value greater
than 0.</p>

<p>-u username Connect as the specified R username . If
user- name is not specified, the current logged in user is
used for authentication. This option is ignored if neither
hostname nor portnumber is specified.</p>

<p>-v httpversion Use the specified HTTP version for the
request. The version must be &quot;1.0&quot; or
&quot;1.1&quot;. The 1.0 ver- sion may not be specified if
the M-POST method is specified.</p>

<p>--version Display CIM Server version.</p>

<p>-w password Authenticate the connection using the
specified password . This option is ignored if neither
hostname nor portnumber is specified. WARNING: A password
should not be specified on the command line on a multi-user
system, since command-line options are typically
world-readable for a short window of time. If the remote
host requests authentication and this option is not
specified, wbemexec will prompt for the password. (See cim-
config (1) for information on configuring the CIM
Server.)</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS When an error occurs, an explanatory error
message is written to stderr and an appropriate value is
returned. The following exit values are returned:</p>

<p>0 Success 1 Error</p>

<p>USAGE NOTE The wbemexec command requires that the CIM
Server is running.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Submit an XML request contained in the file
cimrequest.xml to the CIM Server running on the local host
on the default port:</p>

<p>wbemexec cimrequest.xml</p>

<p>Submit an XML request contained in the file
cimrequest.xml to the CIM Server running on the host
hpserver on port 49152, using the username guest and
password guest for authentication:</p>

<p>wbemexec -h hpserver -p 49152 -u guest -w guest
cimrequest.xml</p>
