<p>NAME xclipboard - X clipboard client</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS xclipboard [ -toolkitoption ... ] [ -w ] [ -nw
]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The xclipboard program is used to collect
and display text selections that are sent to the CLIPBOARD
by other clients. It is typically used to save CLIPBOARD
selections for later use. It stores each CLIPBOARD selection
as a separate string, each of which can be selected. Each
time CLIPBOARD is asserted by another application,
xclipboard transfers the contents of that selection to a new
buffer and displays it in the text window. Buffers are never
automatically deleted, so youll want to use the delete
button to get rid of useless items.</p>

<p>Since xclipboard uses a Text Widget to display the
contents of the clipboard, text sent to the CLIPBOARD may be
re-selected for use in other applications. xclipboard also
responds to requests for the CLIP- BOARD selection from
other clients by sending the entire contents of the
currently displayed buffer.</p>

<p>An xclipboard window has the following buttons across
the top:</p>

<p>quit When this button is pressed, xclipboard exits.</p>

<p>delete When this button is pressed, the current buffer
is deleted and the next one displayed.</p>

<p>new Creates a new buffer with no contents. Useful in
constructing a new CLIPBOARD selection by hand.</p>

<p>save Displays a File Save dialog box. Pressing the
Accept button saves the currently displayed buffer to the
file specified in the text field.</p>

<p>next Displays the next buffer in the list.</p>

<p>previous Displays the previous buffer.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The xclipboard program accepts all of the
standard X Toolkit command line options as well as the
following:</p>

<p>-w This option indicates that lines of text that are too
long to be displayed on one line in the clipboard should
wrap around to the following lines.</p>

<p>-nw This option indicates that long lines of text should
not wrap around. This is the default behavior.</p>

<p>WIDGETS In order to specify resources, it is useful to
know the hierarchy of the widgets which compose xclipboard.
In the notation below, indenta- tion indicates hierarchical
structure. The widget class name is given first, followed by
the widget instance name.</p>

<p>SENDING/RETRIEVING CLIPBOARD CONTENTS Text is copied to
the clipboard whenever a client asserts ownership of the
CLIPBOARD selection. Text is copied from the clipboard
whenever a client requests the contents of the CLIPBOARD
selection. Examples of event bindings that a user may wish
to include in a resource configura- tion file to use the
clipboard are:</p>

<p>*VT100.Translations: #override &lt;Btn3Up&gt;:
select-end(CLIPBOARD) &lt;Btn2Up&gt;:
insert-selection(PRIMARY,CLIPBOARD) &lt;Btn2Down&gt;: ignore
()</p>

<p>SEE ALSO X(7), xcutsel(1), xterm(1), individual client
documentation for how to make a selection and send it to the
CLIPBOARD.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT DISPLAY to get the default host and display
number.</p>

<p>XENVIRONMENT to get the name of a resource file that
overrides the global resources stored in the
RESOURCE_MANAGER property.</p>

<p>FILES /usr/share/X11/app-defaults/XClipboard specifies
required resources</p>
