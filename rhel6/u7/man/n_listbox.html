<p>SYNOPSIS listbox pathName ?options?</p>

<p>STANDARD OPTIONS -background -borderwidth -cursor
-disabledforeground -exportselection -font -foreground
-highlightbackground -highlightcolor -highlightthickness
-relief -selectbackground -selectborderwidth
-selectforeground -setgrid -takefocus -xscrollcommand
-yscrollcommand</p>

<p>See the options manual entry for details on the standard
options.</p>

<p>WIDGET-SPECIFIC OPTIONS Command-Line Name:-activestyle
Database Name: activeStyle Database Class: ActiveStyle</p>

<p>Specifies the style in which to draw the active element.
This must be one of dotbox (show a focus ring around the
active ele- ment), none (no special indication of active
element) or under- line (underline the active element). The
default is underline.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-height Database Name: height Database
Class: Height</p>

<p>Specifies the desired height for the window, in lines.
If zero or less, then the desired height for the window is
made just large enough to hold all the elements in the
listbox.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-listvariable Database Name:
listVariable Database Class: Variable</p>

<p>Specifies the name of a variable. The value of the
variable is a list to be displayed inside the widget; if the
variable value changes then the widget will automatically
update itself to reflect the new value. Attempts to assign a
variable with an invalid list value to -listvariable will
cause an error. Attempts to unset a variable in use as a
-listvariable will fail but will not generate an error.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-selectmode Database Name: selectMode
Database Class: SelectMode</p>

<p>Specifies one of several styles for manipulating the
selection. The value of the option may be arbitrary, but the
default bind- ings expect it to be either single, browse,
multiple, or extended; the default value is browse.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-state Database Name: state Database
Class: State</p>

<p>Specifies one of two states for the listbox: normal or
dis- abled. If the listbox is disabled then items may not be
inserted or deleted, items are drawn in the
-disabledforeground color, and selection cannot be modified
and is not shown (though selection information is
retained).</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-width Database Name: width Database
Class: Width</p>

<p>Specifies the desired width for the window in
characters. If the font does not have a uniform width then
the width of the character 0 is used in translating from
character units to screen units. If zero or less, then the
desired width for the window is made just large enough to
hold all the elements in the listbox.

<p>DESCRIPTION The listbox command creates a new window
(given by the pathName argu- ment) and makes it into a
listbox widget. Additional options, described above, may be
specified on the command line or in the option database to
configure aspects of the listbox such as its colors, font,
text, and relief. The listbox command returns its pathName
argument. At the time this command is invoked, there must
not exist a window named pathName, but pathNames parent must
exist.</p>

<p>A listbox is a widget that displays a list of strings,
one per line. When first created, a new listbox has no
elements. Elements may be added or deleted using widget
commands described below. In addition, one or more elements
may be selected as described below. If a listbox is
exporting its selection (see exportSelection option), then
it will observe the standard X11 protocols for handling the
selection. Listbox selections are available as type STRING;
the value of the selection will be the text of the selected
elements, with newlines separating the elements.</p>

<p>It is not necessary for all the elements to be displayed
in the listbox window at once; commands described below may
be used to change the view in the window. Listboxes allow
scrolling in both directions using the standard
xScrollCommand and yScrollCommand options. They also sup-
port scanning, as described below.</p>

<p>INDICES Many of the widget commands for listboxes take
one or more indices as arguments. An index specifies a
particular element of the listbox, in any of the following
ways:</p>

<p>number Specifies the element as a numerical index, where
0 corre- sponds to the first element in the listbox.</p>

<p>active Indicates the element that has the location
cursor. This element will be displayed as specified by
-activestyle when the listbox has the keyboard focus, and it
is specified with the activate widget command.</p>

<p>anchor Indicates the anchor point for the selection,
which is set with the selection anchor widget command.</p>

<p>end Indicates the end of the listbox. For most commands
this refers to the last element in the listbox, but for a
few commands such as index and insert it refers to the
element just after the last one.</p>

<p>@x,y Indicates the element that covers the point in the
listbox window specified by x and y (in pixel coordinates).
If no element covers that point, then the closest element to
that point is used.</p>

<p>In the widget command descriptions below, arguments
named index, first, and last always contain text indices in
one of the above forms.</p>

<p>WIDGET COMMAND The listbox command creates a new Tcl
command whose name is pathName. This command may be used to
invoke various operations on the widget. It has the
following general form: pathName option ?arg arg ...? Option
and the args determine the exact behavior of the command.
The following commands are possible for listbox widgets:</p>

<p>pathName activate index Sets the active element to the
one indicated by index. If index is outside the range of
elements in the listbox then the closest element is
activated. The active element is drawn as specified by
-activestyle when the widget has the input focus, and its
index may be retrieved with the index active.</p>

<p>pathName bbox index Returns a list of four numbers
describing the bounding box of the text in the element given
by index. The first two elements of the list give the x and
y coordinates of the upper-left cor- ner of the screen area
covered by the text (specified in pixels relative to the
widget) and the last two elements give the width and height
of the area, in pixels. If no part of the element given by
index is visible on the screen, or if index refers to a
non-existent element, then the result is an empty string; if
the element is partially visible, the result gives the full
area of the element, including any parts that are not
visible.</p>

<p>pathName cget option Returns the current value of the
configuration option given by option. Option may have any of
the values accepted by the list- box command.</p>

<p>pathName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?
Query or modify the configuration options of the widget. If
no option is specified, returns a list describing all of the
avail- able options for pathName (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for
information on the format of this list). If option is
specified with no value, then the command returns a list
describing the one named option (this list will be identical
to the corresponding sublist of the value returned if no
option is specified). If one or more option-value pairs are
specified, then the command modifies the given widget
option(s) to have the given value(s); in this case the
command returns an empty string. Option may have any of the
values accepted by the listbox command.</p>

<p>pathName curselection Returns a list containing the
numerical indices of all of the elements in the listbox that
are currently selected. If there are no elements selected in
the listbox then an empty string is returned.</p>

<p>pathName delete first ?last? Deletes one or more
elements of the listbox. First and last are indices
specifying the first and last elements in the range to
delete. If last is not specified it defaults to first, i.e.
a single element is deleted.</p>

<p>pathName get first ?last? If last is omitted, returns
the contents of the listbox element indicated by first, or
an empty string if first refers to a non- existent element.
If last is specified, the command returns a list whose
elements are all of the listbox elements between first and
last, inclusive. Both first and last may have any of the
standard forms for indices.</p>

<p>pathName index index Returns the integer index value
that corresponds to index. If index is end the return value
is a count of the number of ele- ments in the listbox (not
the index of the last element).</p>

<p>pathName insert index ?element element ...? Inserts zero
or more new elements in the list just before the element
given by index. If index is specified as end then the new
elements are added to the end of the list. Returns an empty
string.</p>

<p>pathName itemcget index option Returns the current value
of the item configuration option given by option. Option may
have any of the values accepted by the listbox itemconfigure
command.</p>

<p>pathName itemconfigure index ?option? ?value? ?option
value ...? Query or modify the configuration options of an
item in the listbox. If no option is specified, returns a
list describing all of the available options for the item
(see Tk_ConfigureInfo for information on the format of this
list). If option is spec- ified with no value, then the
command returns a list describing the one named option (this
list will be identical to the corre- sponding sublist of the
value returned if no option is speci- fied). If one or more
option-value pairs are specified, then the command modifies
the given widget option(s) to have the given value(s); in
this case the command returns an empty string. The following
options are currently supported for items:</p>

<p>-background color Color specifies the background color
to use when display- ing the item. It may have any of the
forms accepted by Tk_GetColor.</p>

<p>-foreground color Color specifies the foreground color
to use when display- ing the item. It may have any of the
forms accepted by Tk_GetColor.</p>

<p>-selectbackground color color specifies the background
color to use when display- ing the item while it is
selected. It may have any of the forms accepted by
Tk_GetColor.</p>

<p>-selectforeground color color specifies the foreground
color to use when display- ing the item while it is
selected. It may have any of the forms accepted by
Tk_GetColor.</p>

<p>pathName nearest y Given a y-coordinate within the
listbox window, this command returns the index of the
(visible) listbox element nearest to that y-coordinate.</p>

<p>pathName scan option args This command is used to
implement scanning on listboxes. It has two forms, depending
on option:</p>

<p>pathName scan mark x y Records x and y and the current
view in the listbox win- dow; used in conjunction with later
scan dragto com- mands. Typically this command is associated
with a mouse button press in the widget. It returns an empty
string.</p>

<p>pathName scan dragto x y. This command computes the
difference between its x and y arguments and the x and y
arguments to the last scan mark command for the widget. It
then adjusts the view by 10 times the difference in
coordinates. This command is typically associated with mouse
motion events in the wid- get, to produce the effect of
dragging the list at high speed through the window. The
return value is an empty string.</p>

<p>pathName see index Adjust the view in the listbox so
that the element given by index is visible. If the element
is already visible then the command has no effect; if the
element is near one edge of the window then the listbox
scrolls to bring the element into view at the edge;
otherwise the listbox scrolls to center the ele- ment.</p>

<p>pathName selection option arg This command is used to
adjust the selection within a listbox. It has several forms,
depending on option:</p>

<p>pathName selection anchor index Sets the selection
anchor to the element given by index. If index refers to a
non-existent element, then the clos- est element is used.
The selection anchor is the end of the selection that is
fixed while dragging out a selec- tion with the mouse. The
index anchor may be used to refer to the anchor element.</p>

<p>pathName selection clear first ?last? If any of the
elements between first and last (inclusive) are selected,
they are deselected. The selection state is not changed for
elements outside this range.</p>

<p>pathName selection includes index Returns 1 if the
element indicated by index is currently selected, 0 if it is
not.</p>

<p>pathName selection set first ?last? Selects all of the
elements in the range between first and last, inclusive,
without affecting the selection state of elements outside
that range.</p>

<p>pathName size Returns a decimal string indicating the
total number of elements in the listbox.</p>

<p>pathName xview args This command is used to query and
change the horizontal position of the information in the
widgets window. It can take any of the following forms:</p>

<p>pathName xview Returns a list containing two elements.
Each element is a real fraction between 0 and 1; together
they describe the horizontal span that is visible in the
window. For example, if the first element is .2 and the
second ele- ment is .6, 20% of the listboxs text is
off-screen to the left, the middle 40% is visible in the
window, and 40% of the text is off-screen to the right.
These are the same values passed to scrollbars via the
-xscrollcom- mand option.</p>

<p>pathName xview index Adjusts the view in the window so
that the character position given by index is displayed at
the left edge of the window. Character positions are defined
by the width of the character 0.</p>

<p>pathName xview moveto fraction Adjusts the view in the
window so that fraction of the total width of the listbox
text is off-screen to the left. fraction must be a fraction
between 0 and 1.</p>

<p>pathName xview scroll number what This command shifts
the view in the window left or right according to number and
what. Number must be an integer. What must be either units
or pages or an abbreviation of one of these. If what is
units, the view adjusts left or right by number character
units (the width of the 0 char- acter) on the display; if it
is pages then the view adjusts by number screenfuls. If
number is negative then characters farther to the left
become visible; if it is positive then characters farther to
the right become vis- ible.</p>

<p>pathName yview ?args? This command is used to query and
change the vertical position of the text in the widgets
window. It can take any of the fol- lowing forms:</p>

<p>pathName yview Returns a list containing two elements,
both of which are real fractions between 0 and 1. The first
element gives the position of the listbox element at the top
of the window, relative to the listbox as a whole (0.5 means
it is halfway through the listbox, for example). The second
element gives the position of the listbox element just after
the last one in the window, relative to the listbox as a
whole. These are the same values passed to scroll- bars via
the -yscrollcommand option.</p>

<p>pathName yview index Adjusts the view in the window so
that the element given by index is displayed at the top of
the window.</p>

<p>pathName yview moveto fraction Adjusts the view in the
window so that the element given by fraction appears at the
top of the window. Fraction is a fraction between 0 and 1; 0
indicates the first element in the listbox, 0.33 indicates
the element one- third the way through the listbox, and so
on.</p>

<p>pathName yview scroll number what This command adjusts
the view in the window up or down according to number and
what. Number must be an integer. What must be either units
or pages. If what is units, the view adjusts up or down by
number lines; if it is pages then the view adjusts by number
screenfuls. If number is negative then earlier elements
become visible; if it is positive then later elements become
visible.</p>

<p>DEFAULT BINDINGS Tk automatically creates class bindings
for listboxes that give them Motif-like behavior. Much of
the behavior of a listbox is determined by its selectMode
option, which selects one of four ways of dealing with the
selection.</p>

<p>If the selection mode is single or browse, at most one
element can be selected in the listbox at once. In both
modes, clicking button 1 on an element selects it and
deselects any other selected item. In browse mode it is also
possible to drag the selection with button 1. On but- ton 1,
the listbox will also take focus if it has a normal state
and -takefocus is true.</p>

<p>If the selection mode is multiple or extended, any
number of elements may be selected at once, including
discontiguous ranges. In multiple mode, clicking button 1 on
an element toggles its selection state with- out affecting
any other elements. In extended mode, pressing button 1 on
an element selects it, deselects everything else, and sets
the anchor to the element under the mouse; dragging the
mouse with button 1 down extends the selection to include
all the elements between the anchor and the element under
the mouse, inclusive.</p>

<p>Most people will probably want to use browse mode for
single selections and extended mode for multiple selections;
the other modes appear to be useful only in special
situations.</p>

<p>Any time the selection changes in the listbox, the
virtual event &lt;&lt;ListboxSelect&gt;&gt; will be
generated. It is easiest to bind to this event to be made
aware of any changes to listbox selection.</p>

<p>In addition to the above behavior, the following
additional behavior is defined by the default bindings:</p>

<p>[1] In extended mode, the selected range can be adjusted
by pressing button 1 with the Shift key down: this modifies
the selection to consist of the elements between the anchor
and the element under the mouse, inclusive. The un-anchored
end of this new selection can also be dragged with the
button down.</p>

<p>[2] In extended mode, pressing button 1 with the Control
key down starts a toggle operation: the anchor is set to the
element under the mouse, and its selection state is
reversed. The selection state of other elements is not
changed. If the mouse is dragged with button 1 down, then
the selection state of all elements between the anchor and
the element under the mouse is set to match that of the
anchor element; the selection state of all other elements
remains what it was before the toggle opera- tion began.</p>

<p>[3] If the mouse leaves the listbox window with button 1
down, the window scrolls away from the mouse, making
information visible that used to be off-screen on the side
of the mouse. The scrolling continues until the mouse
re-enters the window, the button is released, or the end of
the listbox is reached.</p>

<p>[4] Mouse button 2 may be used for scanning. If it is
pressed and dragged over the listbox, the contents of the
listbox drag at high speed in the direction the mouse
moves.</p>

<p>[5] If the Up or Down key is pressed, the location
cursor (active element) moves up or down one element. If the
selection mode is browse or extended then the new active
element is also selected and all other elements are
deselected. In extended mode the new active element becomes
the selection anchor.</p>

<p>[6] In extended mode, Shift-Up and Shift-Down move the
location cur- sor (active element) up or down one element
and also extend the selection to that element in a fashion
similar to dragging with mouse button 1.</p>

<p>[7] The Left and Right keys scroll the listbox view left
and right by the width of the character 0. Control-Left and
Control-Right scroll the listbox view left and right by the
width of the win- dow. Control-Prior and Control-Next also
scroll left and right by the width of the window.</p>

<p>[8] The Prior and Next keys scroll the listbox view up
and down by one page (the height of the window).</p>

<p>[9] The Home and End keys scroll the listbox
horizontally to the left and right edges, respectively.</p>

<p>[10] Control-Home sets the location cursor to the first
element in the listbox, selects that element, and deselects
everything else in the listbox.</p>

<p>[11] Control-End sets the location cursor to the last
element in the listbox, selects that element, and deselects
everything else in the listbox.</p>

<p>[12] In extended mode, Control-Shift-Home extends the
selection to the first element in the listbox and
Control-Shift-End extends the selection to the last
element.</p>

<p>[13] In multiple mode, Control-Shift-Home moves the
location cursor to the first element in the listbox and
Control-Shift-End moves the location cursor to the last
element.</p>

<p>[14] The space and Select keys make a selection at the
location cur- sor (active element) just as if mouse button 1
had been pressed over this element.</p>

<p>[15] In extended mode, Control-Shift-space and
Shift-Select extend the selection to the active element just
as if button 1 had been pressed with the Shift key down.</p>

<p>[16] In extended mode, the Escape key cancels the most
recent selec- tion and restores all the elements in the
selected range to their previous selection state.</p>

<p>[17] Control-slash selects everything in the widget,
except in single and browse modes, in which case it selects
the active element and deselects everything else.</p>

<p>[18] Control-backslash deselects everything in the
widget, except in browse mode where it has no effect.</p>

<p>[19] The F16 key (labelled Copy on many Sun
workstations) or Meta-w copies the selection in the widget
to the clipboard, if there is a selection.</p>

<p>The behavior of listboxes can be changed by defining new
bindings for individual widgets or by redefining the class
bindings.</p>
