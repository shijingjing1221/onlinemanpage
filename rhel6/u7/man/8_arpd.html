<p>NAME arpd - userspace arp daemon.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS Usage: arpd [ -lkh? ] [ -a N ] [ -b dbase ] [-B
number] [ -f file ] [-n time] [-R rate] [ interfaces ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The arpd daemon collects gratuitous ARP
information, saving it on local disk and feeding it to
kernel on demand to avoid redundant broadcasting due to
limited size of kernel ARP cache.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -h -? Print help</p>

<p>-l Dump arpd database to stdout and exit. Output
consists of three columns: interface index, IP address and
MAC address. Negative entries for dead hosts are also shown,
in this case MAC address is replaced by word FAILED followed
by colon and time when the fact that host is dead was proven
the last time.</p>

<p>-f &lt;FILE&gt; Read and load arpd database from FILE in
text format similar dumped by option -l. Exit after load,
probably listing resulting database, if option -l is also
given. If FILE is -, stdin is read to get ARP table.</p>

<p>-b &lt;DATABASE&gt; location of database file. Default
location is /var/lib/arpd/arpd.db</p>

<p>-a &lt;NUMBER&gt; arpd not only passively listens ARP on
wire, but also send brod- cast queries itself. NUMBER is
number of such queries to make before destination is
considered as dead. When arpd is started as kernel helper
(i.e. with app_solicit enabled in sysctl or even with option
-k) without this option and still did not learn enough
information, you can observe 1 second gaps in service. Not
fatal, but not good.</p>

<p>-k Suppress sending broadcast queries by kernel. It
takes sense together with option -a.</p>

<p>-n &lt;TIME&gt; Timeout of negative cache. When
resolution fails arpd suppresses further attempts to resolve
for this period. It makes sense only together with option -k
This timeout should not be too much longer than boot time of
a typical host not supporting gratu- itous ARP. Default
value is 60 seconds.</p>

<p>-R &lt;RATE&gt; Maximal steady rate of broadcasts sent
by arpd in packets per second. Default value is 1.</p>

<p>-B &lt;NUMBER&gt; Number of broadcasts sent by
&lt;tt/arpd/ back to back. Default value is 3. Together with
option &lt;tt/-R/ this option allows to police broadcasting
not to exceed B+R*T over any interval of time T.</p>

<p>&lt;INTERFACE&gt; is the name of networking interface to
watch. If no inter- faces given, arpd monitors all the
interfaces. In this case arpd does not adjust sysctl
parameters, it is supposed user does this himself after arpd
is started.</p>

<p>Signals arpd exits gracefully syncing database and
restoring adjusted sysctl parameters, when receives SIGINT
or SIGTERM. SIGHUP syncs database to disk. SIGUSR1 sends
some statistics to syslog. Effect of another sig- nals is
undefined, they may corrupt database and leave sysctl
praame- ters in an unpredictable state.</p>

<p>Note In order for arpd to be able to serve as ARP
resolver, kernel must be compiled with the option
CONFIG_ARPD and, in the case when interface list in not
given on command line, variable app_solicit on interfaces of
interest should be in /proc/sys/net/ipv4/neigh/*. If this is
not made arpd still collects gratuitous ARP information in
its database.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES arpd -b /var/tmp/arpd.db Start arpd to collect
gratuitous ARP, but not messing with ker- nel
functionality.</p>

<p>killall arpd ; arpd -l -b /var/tmp/arpd.db Look at
result after some time.</p>

<p>arpd -b /var/tmp/arpd.db -a 1 eth0 eth1 Enable kernel
helper, leaving leading role to kernel.</p>

<p>arpd -b /var/tmp/arpd.db -a 3 -k eth0 eth1 Completely
replace kernel resolution on interfaces eth0 and eth1. In
this case kernel still does unicast probing to validate
entries, but all the broadcast activity is suppressed and
made under authority of arpd.</p>

<p>This is mode which arpd is supposed to work normally. It
is not default just to prevent occasional enabling of too
aggressive mode occasion- ally.</p>
