<p>DESCRIPTION The jw shell script allows to convert a
DocBook file (or some other SGML-based format) to other
formats (including HTML, RTF, PS and PDF) with an
easy-to-understand syntax. It hides most of Jades or
OpenJade complexity and adds comfortable features.</p>

<p>Other scripts like docbook2html, docbook2rtf or
docbook2ps provide dif- ferent ways of calling jw that might
be easier to remember.</p>

<p>For the moment, jw does not handle XML, but only
SGML.</p>

<p>This utility assumes that several other components are
installed. The list includes:</p>

<p>&middot; the ISO character entities for SGML</p>

<p>&middot; James Clarks DSSSL engine, jade, or an
equivalent parser like Open- Jade</p>

<p>&middot; the DocBook DTD from the OASIS consortium</p>

<p>&middot; Norman Walshs DocBook modular style sheets (or
some other set of DSSSL style sheets)</p>

<p>&middot; Sebastian Rahtz s jadetex set of TeX macros for
jade (for backends intended to &quot;printing&quot; formats
like PDF, RTF or PostScript)</p>

<p>&middot; A perl interpreter (for backends that use
perl)</p>

<p>&middot; SGMLSpm from CPAN (for backends that use
sgmls)</p>

<p>&middot; Lynx HTML browser (for the txt backend)</p>

<p>The jw script is basically called like this:</p>

<p>jw mydoc.sgml</p>

<p>where mydoc.sgml is a SGML file.</p>

<p>The command line above uses default options: it converts
from DocBook (the default frontend) to HTML (the default
backend), does not put the result in a subdirectory (unless
specified otherwise in the style sheets), etc.</p>

<p>In this example, the &quot;mydoc&quot; file name as well
as the &quot;.sgml&quot; extension can be replaced by
anything else. Current extensions for SGML DocBook files
include &quot;.sgml&quot;, &quot;.sgm&quot;,
&quot;.docbook&quot;, and &quot;.db&quot;. The processed
file mydoc.sgml can be in any other directory than the
current one.</p>

<p>Here we have chosen to generate HTML output. In fact we
can use any of the backends stored in the backends/
subdirectory of the DocBook-utils distribution directory
(usually /usr/share/sgml/docbook/utils-0.6.14). Similarly,
you can use any frontend defined in the frontends/ subdirec-
tory to convert from another input format.</p>

<p>This sample command creates one or many HTML files with
arbitrary file names in the current directory. This default
behavior can be changed through command line options and/or
customization style sheets.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The following options apply to the conversion
script:</p>

<p>-f frontend | --frontend frontend Allows to specify
another frontend than default docbook. The list of currently
available frontends is:</p>

<p>docbook Converts docbook with Norman Walsh s style
sheets. This frontend searches in the subdirectories of the
base SGML directory for a file named html/docbook.dsl or
print/doc- book.dsl (depending on the backend s type: html
or print).</p>

<p>-b backend | --backend backend Allows to specify another
backend than default HTML. The list of currently available
backends is:</p>

<p>dvi Converts to DVI (DeVice Independant files) by
calling Jade or OpenJade.</p>

<p>html Converts to HTML (HyperText Markup Language) by
calling Jade or OpenJade.</p>

<p>man Converts a refentry to a Unix manual page by calling
doc- book2man. Does not work with other SGML document types
than DocBook.</p>

<p>pdf Converts to PDF (Portable Document Format) by
calling Jade or OpenJade.</p>

<p>ps Converts to PostScript by calling Jade or
OpenJade.</p>

<p>rtf Converts to RTF (Rich Text Format) by calling Jade
or OpenJade. The resulting file can then be inported into MS
Word or one of its Linux replacement programs.</p>

<p>Note - The original picture must be present when RTF
doc- ument is viewed, because the RTF documents created by
OpenJade includes pictures by reference.</p>

<p>tex Converts to TeX by calling Jade or OpenJade.</p>

<p>texi Converts to GNU TeXinfo pages by calling
docbook2texi. Does not work with other SGML document types
than Doc- Book.</p>

<p>txt Converts to a bare text file by calling Jade or
OpenJade, then Lynx.</p>

<p>-c file | --cat file Allows to use an extra SGML Open
Catalog that will list other files like customization style
sheets, adaptations to the Doc- Book Document Type
Definition, special character entities, etc. This catalog is
added to the list of catalogs determined by the script (see
option --nostd below)</p>

<p>-n | --nostd Do not use the standard SGML Open Catalogs.
Normally, the stan- dard catalogs list is determined like
this:</p>

<p>&middot; if the centralized catalog exists, then use it.
The central- ized catalog is a list of all catalogs that
might be necessary that usually resides in /etc/sgml. Its
name is provided by the frontend, for example the docbook
frontend returns /etc/sgml/sgml-docbook.cat.</p>

<p>&middot; Otherwise, take all the files named catalog
from the subdirec- tories of the SGML base directory
(usually /usr/share/sgml). This option is useful in
conjunction with the --cat option to use only the catalogs
that are specified on the command line.</p>

<p>-d file|default|none | --dsl file|default|none Allows to
use a customized style sheet instead of the default one.</p>

<p>A &quot;target&quot; starting with a hash mark
&quot;#&quot; can be appended to the file name. As a result,
only the corresponding part of the style sheet is executed
(the &quot;style specification&quot; whose &quot;identifica-
tor&quot; is equal to the targets name). A common use of
this mecha- nism is to define &quot;#html&quot; and
&quot;#print&quot; targets to trigger the corresponding part
of a replacement style sheet which is common for both HTML
and printout conversion.</p>

<p>By replacing the file name with &quot;default&quot;, the
default style sheet provided with the frontend is used. For
example, the doc- book frontend returns ./docbook.dsl#html
(or ./docbook.dsl#print) in the SGML base directory.</p>

<p>By replacing the file name with &quot;none&quot;, no
replacement style sheet is used, not even the default style
sheet. The style sheet which is used is also determined by
the frontend. For example, the docbook frontend returns
Norman Walsh s html/docbook.dsl (or print/docbook.dsl) found
somewhere below the SGML base direc- tory.</p>

<p>If no --dsl option is specified, then &quot;--dsl
default&quot; is used.</p>

<p>-l file | --dcl file Allows to use a customized SGML
declaration instead of the default one. The file name of the
default SGML declaration is not set for SGML files, and is
set to xml.dcl in the SGML base directory for XML files.</p>

<p>-s path | --sgmlbase path Allows to use another location
for the SGML base directory. This is the directory below
which all SGML DTDs, style sheets, enti- ties, etc are
installed. The default value is /usr/share/sgml.</p>

<p>-p program | --parser program Specify the parser to use
(Jade or OpenJade) if several are installed. If this option
is not specified, the script first tries to use Jade, then
it tries OpenJade.</p>

<p>-o directory | --output directory Set output directory
where all the resulting files will be stored. If the style
sheets define a subdirectory where to store the resulting
files too, the subdirectory defined by the style sheets will
be placed below the subdirectory defined by this option.</p>

<p>-V variable=[value] Set a variable (to a value, if one
is specified).</p>

<p>-u | --nochunks Output only one big file. This option is
useful only when gener- ating HTML, because the output can
be split into several files. This option overrides the
setting that may be done in the style sheets.</p>

<p>-i section | --include section Declare a SGML marked
section as &quot;include&quot;. A SGML marked sec- tion is a
kind of conditional part of a document. If it is declared
&quot;ignore&quot;, it will be left ignored, otherwise it
will be processed. An example of such a marked section would
be:</p>

<p>&lt;DOCTYPE mydoc [ &lt;!ENTITY % confidential
&quot;ignore&quot;&gt; ]&gt; &lt;mydoc&gt; ... &lt;![
%confidential [ Some confidential text... ]]&gt; ...
&lt;/mydoc&gt;</p>

<p>-w type|list | --warning type|list Enables or disables
the display of given types of warnings. Several -w options
might be entered on the command line. Warn- ing types that
start with &quot;no-&quot; disable the corresponding warn-
ings, the other types enable them.</p>

<p>If the warning type is replaced with &quot;list&quot;,
then a list of allowed warning types is displayed.</p>

<p>-e type|list | --error type|list Disables given types of
errors. Several -e options might be entered on the command
line. All error types start with &quot;no-&quot;.</p>

<p>If the error type is replaced with &quot;list&quot;,
then a list of allowed error types is displayed.</p>

<p>-h | --help Print a short help message and exit</p>

<p>-v | --version Print the version identifier and exit</p>

<p>FILES /etc/sgml/sgml-docbook.cat Centralized SGML open
catalog. This file name might vary if another frontend than
docbook is used.</p>
