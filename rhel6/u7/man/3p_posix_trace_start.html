<p>POSIX_TRACE_START(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
POSIX_TRACE_START(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME posix_trace_start, posix_trace_stop - trace start
and stop (TRACING)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;trace.h&gt;</p>

<p>int posix_trace_start(trace_id_t trid); int
posix_trace_stop (trace_id_t trid);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The posix_trace_start() and
posix_trace_stop() functions, respectively, shall start and
stop the trace stream identified by the argument trid.</p>

<p>The effect of calling the posix_trace_start() function
shall be recorded in the trace stream as the
POSIX_TRACE_START system trace event and the status of the
trace stream shall become POSIX_TRACE_RUN- NING. If the
trace stream is in progress when this function is called,
the POSIX_TRACE_START system trace event shall not be
recorded and the trace stream shall continue to run. If the
trace stream is full, the POSIX_TRACE_START system trace
event shall not be recorded and the sta- tus of the trace
stream shall not be changed.</p>

<p>The effect of calling the posix_trace_stop() function
shall be recorded in the trace stream as the
POSIX_TRACE_STOP system trace event and the status of the
trace stream shall become POSIX_TRACE_SUSPENDED. If the
trace stream is suspended when this function is called, the
POSIX_TRACE_STOP system trace event shall not be recorded
and the trace stream shall remain suspended. If the trace
stream is full, the POSIX_TRACE_STOP system trace event
shall not be recorded and the sta- tus of the trace stream
shall not be changed.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, these functions
shall return a value of zero. Otherwise, they shall return
the corresponding error number.</p>

<p>ERRORS These functions shall fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The value of the argument trid does not
correspond to an active trace stream and thus no trace
stream was started or stopped.</p>

<p>EINTR The operation was interrupted by a signal and thus
the trace stream was not necessarily started or stopped.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
