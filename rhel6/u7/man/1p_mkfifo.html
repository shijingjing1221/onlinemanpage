<p>MKFIFO(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual MKFIFO(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME mkfifo - make FIFO special files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS mkfifo [-m mode] file...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The mkfifo utility shall create the FIFO
special files specified by the operands, in the order
specified.</p>

<p>For each file operand, the mkfifo utility shall perform
actions equiva- lent to the mkfifo() function defined in the
System Interfaces volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, called
with the following arguments:</p>

<p>1. The file operand is used as the path argument.</p>

<p>2. The value of the bitwise-inclusive OR of S_IRUSR,
S_IWUSR, S_IRGRP, S_IWGRP, S_IROTH, and S_IWOTH is used as
the mode argument. (If the -m option is specified, the value
of the mkfifo() mode argument is unspecified, but the FIFO
shall at no time have permissions less restrictive than the
-m mode option-argument.)</p>

<p>OPTIONS The mkfifo utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>The following option shall be supported:</p>

<p>-m mode Set the file permission bits of the
newly-created FIFO to the specified mode value. The mode
option-argument shall be the same as the mode operand
defined for the chmod utility. In the sym- bolic_mode
strings, the op characters + and - shall be interpreted
relative to an assumed initial mode of a= rw.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p>file A pathname of the FIFO special file to be
created.</p>

<p>STDIN Not used.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of mkfifo:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in
arguments).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT Not used.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 All the specified FIFO special files were created
successfully.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE This utility was added to permit shell
applications to create FIFO spe- cial files.</p>

<p>The -m option was added to control the file mode, for
consistency with the similar functionality provided by the
mkdir utility.</p>

<p>Early proposals included a -p option similar to the
mkdir -p option that created intermediate directories
leading up to the FIFO specified by the final component.
This was removed because it is not commonly needed and is
not common practice with similar utilities.</p>

<p>The functionality of mkfifo is described substantially
through a refer- ence to the mkfifo() function in the System
Interfaces volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001. For example, by
default, the mode of the FIFO file is affected by the file
mode creation mask in accordance with the specified behavior
of the mkfifo() function. In this way, there is less
duplication of effort required for describing details of the
file cre- ation.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>

of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, mkfifo()</p>
