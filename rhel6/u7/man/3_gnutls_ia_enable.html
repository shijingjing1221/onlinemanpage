<p>NAME gnutls_ia_enable - Indicate willingness for TLS/IA
application phases</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;gnutls/extra.h&gt;</p>

<p>void gnutls_ia_enable(gnutls_session_t session, int
allow_skip_on_resume);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS gnutls_session_t session is a gnutls_session_t
structure.</p>

<p>int allow_skip_on_resume non-zero if local party allows
to skip the TLS/IA applica- tion phases for a resumed
session.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Specify whether we must advertise support
for the TLS/IA extension dur- ing the handshake.</p>

<p>At the client side, we always advertise TLS/IA if
gnutls_ia_enable was called before the handshake; at the
server side, we also require that the client has advertised
that it wants to run TLS/IA before including the
advertisement, as required by the protocol.</p>

<p>Similarly, at the client side we always advertise that
we allow TLS/IA to be skipped for resumed sessions if
allow_skip_on_resume is non-zero; at the server side, we
also require that the session is indeed resum- able and that
the client has also advertised that it allows TLS/IA to be
skipped for resumed sessions.</p>

<p>After the TLS handshake, call gnutls_ia_handshake_p() to
find out whether both parties agreed to do a TLS/IA
handshake, before calling gnutls_ia_handshake() or one of
the lower level gnutls_ia_* functions.</p>
