<p>NAME perlpod - the Plain Old Documentation format</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Pod is a simple-to-use markup language used
for writing documentation for Perl, Perl programs, and Perl
modules.</p>

<p>Translators are available for converting Pod to various
formats like plain text, HTML, man pages, and more.</p>

<p>Pod markup consists of three basic kinds of paragraphs:
ordinary, verbatim, and command.</p>

<p>Ordinary Paragraph Most paragraphs in your documentation
will be ordinary blocks of text, like this one. You can
simply type in your text without any markup whatsoever, and
with just a blank line before and after. When it gets
formatted, it will undergo minimal formatting, like being
rewrapped, probably put into a proportionally spaced font,
and maybe even justified.</p>

<p>You can use formatting codes in ordinary paragraphs, for
bold, italic, &quot;code-style&quot;, hyperlinks, and more.
Such codes are explained in the &quot;Formatting Codes&quot;
section, below.</p>

<p>Verbatim Paragraph Verbatim paragraphs are usually used
for presenting a codeblock or other text which does not
require any special parsing or formatting, and which
shouldnt be wrapped.</p>

<p>A verbatim paragraph is distinguished by having its
first character be a space or a tab. (And commonly, all its
lines begin with spaces and/or tabs.) It should be
reproduced exactly, with tabs assumed to be on 8-column
boundaries. There are no special formatting codes, so you
cant italicize or anything like that. A means and nothing
else.</p>

<p>Command Paragraph A command paragraph is used for
special treatment of whole chunks of text, usually as
headings or parts of lists.</p>

<p>All command paragraphs (which are typically only one
line long) start with &quot;=&quot;, followed by an
identifier, followed by arbitrary text that the command can
use however it pleases. Currently recognized commands
are</p>

<p>=pod =head1 Heading Text =head2 Heading Text =head3
Heading Text =head4 Heading Text =over indentlevel =item
stuff =back =begin format =end format =for format text...
=encoding type =cut</p>

<p>To explain them each in detail:</p>

<p>&quot;=head1 Heading Text&quot; &quot;=head2 Heading
Text&quot; &quot;=head3 Heading Text&quot; &quot;=head4
Heading Text&quot; Head1 through head4 produce headings,
head1 being the highest level. The text in the rest of this
paragraph is the content of the heading. For example:</p>

<p>=head2 Object Attributes</p>

<p>The text &quot;Object Attributes&quot; comprises the
heading there. (Note that head3 and head4 are recent
additions, not supported in older Pod translators.) The text
in these heading commands can use formatting codes, as seen
here:</p>

<p>=head2 Possible Values for C&lt;$/&gt;</p>

<p>Such commands are explained in the &quot;Formatting
Codes&quot; section, below.</p>

<p>&quot;=over indentlevel&quot; &quot;=item stuff...&quot;
&quot;=back&quot; Item, over, and back require a little more
explanation: &quot;=over&quot; starts a region specifically
for the generation of a list using &quot;=item&quot;
commands, or for indenting (groups of) normal paragraphs. At
the end of your list, use &quot;=back&quot; to end it. The
indentlevel option to &quot;=over&quot; indicates how far
over to indent, generally in ems (where one em is the width
of an &quot;M&quot; in the documents base font) or roughly
comparable units; if there is no indentlevel option, it
defaults to four. (And some formatters may just ignore
whatever indentlevel you provide.) In the stuff in
&quot;=item stuff...&quot;, you may use formatting codes, as
seen here:</p>

<p>=item Using C&lt;$|&gt; to Control Buffering</p>

<p>Such commands are explained in the &quot;Formatting
Codes&quot; section, below.</p>

<p>Note also that there are some basic rules to using
&quot;=over&quot; ... &quot;=back&quot; regions:</p>

<p>&middot; Don t use &quot;=item&quot;s outside of an
&quot;=over&quot; ... &quot;=back&quot; region.</p>

<p>&middot; The first thing after the &quot;=over&quot;
command should be an &quot;=item&quot;, unless there arent
going to be any items at all in this &quot;=over&quot; ...
&quot;=back&quot; region.</p>

<p>&middot; Dont put &quot;=headn&quot; commands inside an
&quot;=over&quot; ... &quot;=back&quot; region.</p>

<p>&middot; And perhaps most importantly, keep the items
consistent: either use &quot;=item *&quot; for all of them,
to produce bullets; or use &quot;=item 1.&quot;, &quot;=item
2.&quot;, etc., to produce numbered lists; or use
&quot;=item foo&quot;, &quot;=item bar&quot;, etc. --
namely, things that look nothing like bullets or
numbers.</p>

<p>If you start with bullets or numbers, stick with them,
as formatters use the first &quot;=item&quot; type to decide
how to format the list.</p>

<p>&quot;=cut&quot; To end a Pod block, use a blank line,
then a line beginning with &quot;=cut&quot;, and a blank
line after it. This lets Perl (and the Pod formatter) know
that this is where Perl code is resuming. (The blank line
before the &quot;=cut&quot; is not technically necessary,
but many older Pod processors require it.)</p>

<p>&quot;=pod&quot; The &quot;=pod&quot; command by itself
doesn t do much of anything, but it signals to Perl (and Pod
formatters) that a Pod block starts here. A Pod block starts
with any command paragraph, so a &quot;=pod&quot; command is
usually used just when you want to start a Pod block with an
ordinary paragraph or a verbatim paragraph. For example:</p>

<p>=item stuff()</p>

<p>This function does stuff.</p>

<p>=cut</p>

<p>sub stuff { ... }</p>

<p>=pod</p>

<p>Remember to check its return value, as in:</p>

<p>stuff() || die &quot;Couldn&rsquo;t do stuff!&quot;;</p>

<p>=cut</p>

<p>&quot;=begin formatname&quot; &quot;=end
formatname&quot; &quot;=for formatname text...&quot; For,
begin, and end will let you have regions of text/code/data
that are not generally interpreted as normal Pod text, but
are passed directly to particular formatters, or are
otherwise special. A formatter that can use that format will
use the region, otherwise it will be completely ignored.</p>

<p>A command &quot;=begin formatname&quot;, some
paragraphs, and a command &quot;=end formatname&quot;, mean
that the text/data in between is meant for formatters that
understand the special format called formatname. For
example,</p>

<p>=begin html</p>

<p>&lt;hr&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;thang.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt; This is a raw HTML paragraph &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>=end html</p>

<p>The command &quot;=for formatname text...&quot;
specifies that the remainder of just this paragraph
(starting right after formatname) is in that special
format.</p>

<p>=for html &lt;hr&gt; &lt;img
src=&quot;thang.png&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt; This is a raw HTML
paragraph &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>This means the same thing as the above &quot;=begin
html&quot; ... &quot;=end html&quot; region.</p>

<p>That is, with &quot;=for&quot;, you can have only one
paragraphs worth of text (i.e., the text in &quot;=foo
targetname text...&quot;), but with &quot;=begin
targetname&quot; ... &quot;=end targetname&quot;, you can
have any amount of stuff inbetween. (Note that there still
must be a blank line after the &quot;=begin&quot; command
and a blank line before the &quot;=end&quot; command.</p>

<p>Here are some examples of how to use these:</p>

<p>=begin html</p>

<p>&lt;br&gt;Figure 1.&lt;br&gt;&lt;IMG
SRC=&quot;figure1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;</p>

<p>=end html</p>

<p>=begin text</p>

<p>--------------- | foo | | bar | ---------------</p>

<p>^^^^ Figure 1. ^^^^</p>

<p>=end text</p>

<p>Some format names that formatters currently are known to
accept include &quot;roff&quot;, &quot;man&quot;,
&quot;latex&quot;, &quot;tex&quot;, &quot;text&quot;, and
&quot;html&quot;. (Some formatters will treat some of these
as synonyms.)</p>

<p>A format name of &quot;comment&quot; is common for just
making notes (presumably to yourself) that won t appear in
any formatted version of the Pod document:</p>

<p>=for comment Make sure that all the available options
are documented!</p>

<p>Some formatnames will require a leading colon (as in
&quot;=for :formatname&quot;, or &quot;=begin
:formatname&quot; ... &quot;=end :formatname&quot;), to
signal that the text is not raw data, but instead is Pod
text (i.e., possibly containing formatting codes) thats just
not for normal formatting (e.g., may not be a normal-use
paragraph, but might be for formatting as a footnote).</p>

<p>&quot;=encoding encodingname&quot; This command is used
for declaring the encoding of a document. Most users wont
need this; but if your encoding isn t US-ASCII or Latin-1,
then put a &quot;=encoding encodingname&quot; command early
in the document so that pod formatters will know how to
decode the document. For encodingname, use a name recognized
by the Encode::Supported module. Examples:</p>

<p>=encoding utf8</p>

<p>=encoding koi8-r</p>

<p>=encoding ShiftJIS</p>

<p>=encoding big5</p>

<p>&quot;=encoding&quot; affects the whole document, and
must occur only once.</p>

<p>And don t forget, when using any other command, that the
command lasts up until the end of its paragraph, not its
line. So in the examples below, you can see that every
command needs the blank line after it, to end its
paragraph.</p>

<p>Some examples of lists include:</p>

<p>=over</p>

<p>=item *</p>

<p>First item</p>

<p>=item *</p>

<p>Second item</p>

<p>=back</p>

<p>=over</p>

<p>=item Foo()</p>

<p>Description of Foo function</p>

<p>=item Bar()</p>

<p>Description of Bar function</p>

<p>=back</p>

<p>Formatting Codes In ordinary paragraphs and in some
command paragraphs, various formatting codes (a.k.a.
&quot;interior sequences&quot;) can be used:</p>

<p>&quot;I&lt;text&gt;&quot; -- italic text Used for
emphasis (&quot;&quot;be I&lt;careful!&gt;&quot;&quot;) and
parameters (&quot;&quot;redo I&lt;LABEL&gt;&quot;&quot;)</p>

<p>&quot;B&lt;text&gt;&quot; -- bold text Used for switches
(&quot;&quot;perl&rsquo;s B&lt;-n&gt; switch&quot;&quot;),
programs (&quot;&quot;some systems provide a B&lt;chfn&gt;
for that&quot;&quot;), emphasis (&quot;&quot;be
B&lt;careful!&gt;&quot;&quot;), and so on (&quot;&quot;and
that feature is known as
B&lt;autovivification&gt;&quot;&quot;).</p>

<p>&quot;C&lt;code&gt;&quot; -- code text Renders code in a
typewriter font, or gives some other indication that this
represents program text
(&quot;&quot;C&lt;gmtime($^T)&gt;&quot;&quot;) or some other
form of computerese
(&quot;&quot;C&lt;drwxr-xr-x&gt;&quot;&quot;).</p>

<p>&quot;L&lt;name&gt;&quot; -- a hyperlink There are
various syntaxes, listed below. In the syntaxes given,
&quot;text&quot;, &quot;name&quot;, and &quot;section&quot;
cannot contain the characters / and |; and any &lt; or &gt;
should be matched.</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;L&lt;name&gt;&quot;</p>

<p>Link to a Perl manual page (e.g.,
&quot;L&lt;Net::Ping&gt;&quot;). Note that &quot;name&quot;
should not contain spaces. This syntax is also occasionally
used for references to UNIX man pages, as in
&quot;L&lt;crontab(5)&gt;&quot;.</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;L&lt;name/&quot;sec&quot;&gt;&quot; or
&quot;L&lt;name/sec&gt;&quot;</p>

<p>Link to a section in other manual page. E.g.,
&quot;L&lt;perlsyn/&quot;For Loops&quot;&gt;&quot;</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;L&lt;/&quot;sec&quot;&gt;&quot; or
&quot;L&lt;/sec&gt;&quot;</p>

<p>Link to a section in this manual page. E.g.,
&quot;L&lt;/&quot;Object Methods&quot;&gt;&quot;</p>

<p>A section is started by the named heading or item. For
example, &quot;L&lt;perlvar/$.&gt;&quot; or
&quot;L&lt;perlvar/&quot;$.&quot;&gt;&quot; both link to the
section started by &quot;&quot;=item $.&quot;&quot; in
perlvar. And &quot;L&lt;perlsyn/For Loops&gt;&quot; or
&quot;L&lt;perlsyn/&quot;For Loops&quot;&gt;&quot; both link
to the section started by &quot;&quot;=head2 For
Loops&quot;&quot; in perlsyn.</p>

<p>To control what text is used for display, you use
&quot;&quot;L&lt;text|...&gt;&quot;&quot;, as in:</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;L&lt;text|name&gt;&quot;</p>

<p>Link this text to that manual page. E.g.,
&quot;L&lt;Perl Error Messages|perldiag&gt;&quot;</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;L&lt;text|name/&quot;sec&quot;&gt;&quot;
or &quot;L&lt;text|name/sec&gt;&quot;</p>

<p>Link this text to that section in that manual page.
E.g., &quot;L&lt;postfix
&quot;if&quot;|perlsyn/&quot;Statement
Modifiers&quot;&gt;&quot;</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;L&lt;text|/&quot;sec&quot;&gt;&quot; or
&quot;L&lt;text|/sec&gt;&quot; or
&quot;L&lt;text|&quot;sec&quot;&gt;&quot;</p>

<p>Link this text to that section in this manual page.
E.g., &quot;L&lt;the various attributes|/&quot;Member
Data&quot;&gt;&quot;</p>

<p>Or you can link to a web page:</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;L&lt;scheme:...&gt;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;L&lt;text|scheme:...&gt;&quot;</p>

<p>Links to an absolute URL. For example,
&quot;L&lt;http://www.perl.org/&gt;&quot; or &quot;L&lt;The
Perl Home Page|http://www.perl.org/&gt;&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;E&lt;escape&gt;&quot; -- a character escape Very
similar to HTML/XML &quot;&amp;foo;&quot; &quot;entity
references&quot;:</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;E&lt;lt&gt;&quot; -- a literal &lt; (less
than)</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;E&lt;gt&gt;&quot; -- a literal &gt;
(greater than)</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;E&lt;verbar&gt;&quot; -- a literal |
(vertical bar)</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;E&lt;sol&gt;&quot; = a literal /
(solidus)</p>

<p>The above four are optional except in other formatting
codes, notably &quot;L&lt;...&gt;&quot;, and when preceded
by a capital letter.</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;E&lt;htmlname&gt;&quot;</p>

<p>Some non-numeric HTML entity name, such as
&quot;E&lt;eacute&gt;&quot;, meaning the same thing as
&quot;&amp;eacute;&quot; in HTML -- i.e., a lowercase e with
an acute (/-shaped) accent.</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;E&lt;number&gt;&quot;</p>

<p>The ASCII/Latin-1/Unicode character with that number. A
leading &quot;0x&quot; means that number is hex, as in
&quot;E&lt;0x201E&gt;&quot;. A leading &quot;0&quot; means
that number is octal, as in &quot;E&lt;075&gt;&quot;.
Otherwise number is interpreted as being in decimal, as in
&quot;E&lt;181&gt;&quot;.</p>

<p>Note that older Pod formatters might not recognize octal
or hex numeric escapes, and that many formatters cannot
reliably render characters above 255. (Some formatters may
even have to use compromised renderings of Latin-1
characters, like rendering &quot;E&lt;eacute&gt;&quot; as
just a plain &quot;e&quot;.)</p>

<p>&quot;F&lt;filename&gt;&quot; -- used for filenames
Typically displayed in italics. Example:
&quot;&quot;F&lt;.cshrc&gt;&quot;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;S&lt;text&gt;&quot; -- text contains non-breaking
spaces This means that the words in text should not be
broken across lines. Example: &quot;S&lt;$x ? $y :
$z&gt;&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;X&lt;topic name&gt;&quot; -- an index entry This
is ignored by most formatters, but some may use it for
building indexes. It always renders as empty-string.
Example: &quot;X&lt;absolutizing relative URLs&gt;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Z&lt;&gt;&quot; -- a null (zero-effect) formatting
code This is rarely used. Its one way to get around using an
E&lt;...&gt; code sometimes. For example, instead of
&quot;&quot;NE&lt;lt&gt;3&quot;&quot; (for
&quot;N&lt;3&quot;) you could write
&quot;&quot;NZ&lt;&gt;&lt;3&quot;&quot; (the
&quot;Z&lt;&gt;&quot; breaks up the &quot;N&quot; and the
&quot;&lt;&quot; so they cant be considered the part of a
(fictitious) &quot;N&lt;...&gt;&quot; code.</p>

<p>Most of the time, you will need only a single set of
angle brackets to delimit the beginning and end of
formatting codes. However, sometimes you will want to put a
real right angle bracket (a greater-than sign, &gt;) inside
of a formatting code. This is particularly common when using
a formatting code to provide a different font-type for a
snippet of code. As with all things in Perl, there is more
than one way to do it. One way is to simply escape the
closing bracket using an &quot;E&quot; code:</p>

<p>C&lt;$a E&lt;lt&gt;=E&lt;gt&gt; $b&gt;</p>

<p>This will produce: &quot;&quot;$a &lt;=&gt;
$b&quot;&quot;</p>

<p>A more readable, and perhaps more &quot;plain&quot; way
is to use an alternate set of delimiters that doesnt require
a single &quot;&gt;&quot; to be escaped. With the Pod
formatters that are standard starting with perl5.5.660,
doubled angle brackets (&quot;&lt;&lt;&quot; and
&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;) may be used if and only if there is
whitespace right after the opening delimiter and whitespace
right before the closing delimiter! For example, the
following will do the trick:</p>

<p>C&lt;&lt; $a &lt;=&gt; $b &gt;&gt;</p>

<p>In fact, you can use as many repeated angle-brackets as
you like so long as you have the same number of them in the
opening and closing delimiters, and make sure that
whitespace immediately follows the last &lt; of the opening
delimiter, and immediately precedes the first &gt; of the
closing delimiter. (The whitespace is ignored.) So the
following will also work:</p>

<p>C&lt;&lt;&lt; $a &lt;=&gt; $b &gt;&gt;&gt;
C&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; $a &lt;=&gt; $b &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>

<p>And they all mean exactly the same as this:</p>

<p>C&lt;$a E&lt;lt&gt;=E&lt;gt&gt; $b&gt;</p>

<p>As a further example, this means that if you wanted to
put these bits of code in &quot;C&quot; (code) style:</p>

<p>open(X, &quot;&gt;&gt;thing.dat&quot;) || die $!
$foo-&gt;bar();</p>

<p>you could do it like so:</p>

<p>C&lt;&lt;&lt; open(X, &quot;&gt;&gt;thing.dat&quot;) ||
die $! &gt;&gt;&gt; C&lt;&lt; $foo-&gt;bar(); &gt;&gt;</p>

<p>which is presumably easier to read than the old way:</p>

<p>C&lt;open(X,
&quot;E&lt;gt&gt;E&lt;gt&gt;thing.dat&quot;) || die $!&gt;
C&lt;$foo-E&lt;gt&gt;bar();&gt;</p>

<p>This is currently supported by pod2text (Pod::Text),
pod2man (Pod::Man), and any other pod2xxx or Pod::Xxxx
translators that use Pod::Parser 1.093 or later, or
Pod::Tree 1.02 or later.</p>

<p>The Intent The intent is simplicity of use, not power of
expression. Paragraphs look like paragraphs (block format),
so that they stand out visually, and so that I could run
them through &quot;fmt&quot; easily to reformat them (that s
F7 in my version of vi, or Esc Q in my version of emacs). I
wanted the translator to always leave the
&quot;&rsquo;&quot; and &quot;&lsquo;&quot; and
&quot;&quot;&quot; quotes alone, in verbatim mode, so I
could slurp in a working program, shift it over four spaces,
and have it print out, er, verbatim. And presumably in a
monospace font.</p>

<p>The Pod format is not necessarily sufficient for writing
a book. Pod is just meant to be an idiot-proof common source
for nroff, HTML, TeX, and other markup languages, as used
for online documentation. Translators exist for pod2text,
pod2html, pod2man (that s for nroff(1) and troff(1)),
pod2latex, and pod2fm. Various others are available in
CPAN.</p>

<p>Embedding Pods in Perl Modules You can embed Pod
documentation in your Perl modules and scripts. Start your
documentation with an empty line, a &quot;=head1&quot;
command at the beginning, and end it with a &quot;=cut&quot;
command and an empty line. Perl will ignore the Pod text.
See any of the supplied library modules for examples. If
youre going to put your Pod at the end of the file, and you
re using an __END__ or __DATA__ cut mark, make sure to put
an empty line there before the first Pod command.</p>

<p>__END__</p>

<p>=head1 NAME</p>

<p>Time::Local - efficiently compute time from local and
GMT time</p>

<p>Without that empty line before the &quot;=head1&quot;,
many translators wouldnt have recognized the
&quot;=head1&quot; as starting a Pod block.</p>

<p>Hints for Writing Pod &middot;</p>

<p>The podchecker command is provided for checking Pod
syntax for errors and warnings. For example, it checks for
completely blank lines in Pod blocks and for unknown
commands and formatting codes. You should still also pass
your document through one or more translators and proofread
the result, or print out the result and proofread that. Some
of the problems found may be bugs in the translators, which
you may or may not wish to work around.</p>

<p>&middot; If youre more familiar with writing in HTML
than with writing in Pod, you can try your hand at writing
documentation in simple HTML, and converting it to Pod with
the experimental Pod::HTML2Pod module, (available in CPAN),
and looking at the resulting code. The experimental
Pod::PXML module in CPAN might also be useful.</p>

<p>&middot; Many older Pod translators require the lines
before every Pod command and after every Pod command
(including &quot;=cut&quot;!) to be a blank line. Having
something like this:</p>

<p># - - - - - - - - - - - - =item
$firecracker-&gt;boom()</p>

<p>This noisily detonates the firecracker object. =cut sub
boom { ...</p>

<p>...will make such Pod translators completely fail to see
the Pod block at all.</p>

<p>Instead, have it like this:</p>

<p># - - - - - - - - - - - -</p>

<p>=item $firecracker-&gt;boom()</p>

<p>This noisily detonates the firecracker object.</p>

<p>=cut</p>

<p>sub boom { ...</p>

<p>&middot; Some older Pod translators require paragraphs
(including command paragraphs like &quot;=head2
Functions&quot;) to be separated by completely empty lines.
If you have an apparently empty line with some spaces on it,
this might not count as a separator for those translators,
and that could cause odd formatting.</p>

<p>&middot; Older translators might add wording around an
L&lt;&gt; link, so that &quot;L&lt;Foo::Bar&gt;&quot; may
become &quot;the Foo::Bar manpage&quot;, for example. So you
shouldn t write things like &quot;the L&lt;foo&gt;
documentation&quot;, if you want the translated document to
read sensibly -- instead write &quot;the
L&lt;Foo::Bar|Foo::Bar&gt; documentation&quot; or
&quot;L&lt;the Foo::Bar documentation|Foo::Bar&gt;&quot;, to
control how the link comes out.</p>

<p>&middot; Going past the 70th column in a verbatim block
might be ungracefully wrapped by some formatters.</p>
