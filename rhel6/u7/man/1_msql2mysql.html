<p>MSQL2MYSQL(1) MySQL Database System MSQL2MYSQL(1)</p>

<p>NAME msql2mysql - convert mSQL programs for use with
MySQL</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS msql2mysqlC-source-file ...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Initially, the MySQL C API was developed to
be very similar to that for the mSQL database system.
Because of this, mSQL programs often can be converted
relatively easily for use with MySQL by changing the names
of the C API functions.</p>

<p>The msql2mysql utility performs the conversion of mSQL C
API function calls to their MySQL equivalents. msql2mysql
converts the input file in place, so make a copy of the
original before converting it. For example, use msql2mysql
like this:</p>

<p>shell&gt; cp client-prog.c client-prog.c.orig shell&gt;
msql2mysql client-prog.c client-prog.c converted</p>

<p>Then examine client-prog.c and make any post-conversion
revisions that may be necessary.</p>

<p>msql2mysql uses the replace utility to make the function
name substitutions. See replace(1).</p>
