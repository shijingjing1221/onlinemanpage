<p>HYPOT(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual HYPOT(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME hypot, hypotf, hypotl - Euclidean distance
function</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;math.h&gt;</p>

<p>double hypot(double x, double y); float hypotf(float x,
float y); long double hypotl(long double x, long double
y);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION These functions shall compute the value of
the square root of x**2+ y**2 without undue overflow or
underflow.</p>

<p>An application wishing to check for error situations
should set errno to zero and call
feclearexcept(FE_ALL_EXCEPT) before calling these functions.
On return, if errno is non-zero or fetestexcept(FE_INVALID |
FE_DIVBYZERO | FE_OVERFLOW | FE_UNDERFLOW) is non-zero, an
error has occurred.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, these functions
shall return the length of the hypotenuse of a right-angled
triangle with sides of length x and y.</p>

<p>If the correct value would cause overflow, a range error
shall occur and hypot(), hypotf(), and hypotl() shall return
the value of the macro HUGE_VAL, HUGE_VALF, and HUGE_VALL,
respectively.</p>

<p>If x or y is &plusmn;Inf, +Inf shall be returned (even
if one of x or y is NaN).</p>

<p>If x or y is NaN, and the other is not &plusmn;Inf, a
NaN shall be returned.</p>

<p>If both arguments are subnormal and the correct result
is subnormal, a range error may occur and the correct result
is returned.</p>

<p>ERRORS These functions shall fail if:</p>

<p>Range Error The result overflows.</p>

<p>If the integer expression (math_errhandling &amp;
MATH_ERRNO) is non-zero, then errno shall be set to
[ERANGE]. If the integer expression (math_errhandling &amp;
MATH_ERREXCEPT) is non-zero, then the overflow
floating-point exception shall be raised.</p>

<p>These functions may fail if:</p>

<p>Range Error The result underflows.</p>

<p>If the integer expression (math_errhandling &amp;
MATH_ERRNO) is non-zero, then errno shall be set to
[ERANGE]. If the integer expression (math_errhandling &amp;
MATH_ERREXCEPT) is non-zero, then the underflow
floating-point exception shall be raised.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE hypot(x,y), hypot(y,x), and hypot(x,
-y) are equivalent.</p>

<p>hypot(x, &plusmn;0) is equivalent to fabs(x).</p>

<p>Underflow only happens when both x and y are subnormal
and the (inex- act) result is also subnormal.</p>

<p>These functions take precautions against overflow during
intermediate steps of the computation.</p>

<p>On error, the expressions (math_errhandling &amp;
MATH_ERRNO) and (math_errhandling &amp; MATH_ERREXCEPT) are
independent of each other, but at least one of them must be
non-zero.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
