<p>NAME plymouth - A graphical boot system and logger</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS plymouth-set-default-theme [options]
&lt;theme&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION plymouth is a graphical boot system for
Linux which takes advantage of the kernel-based mode setting
(KMS) available for modern graphic cards to provide a
seamless, flickerfree and attractive boot screen. It allows
to choose between various, static or animated graphical
themes to spruce up the startup and avoid the noise
generated by the vast amount of kernel messages while the
machine boots into X. On systems where kernel-based mode
setting is not available, plymouth falls back to a text mode
boot screen which provides a simple progress bar to pro-
vide feedback during boot.</p>

<p>To configure plymouth, that is to choose and install the
preferred boot theme, the user has to invoke
plymouth-set-default-theme. It changes the configuration to
the new theme and also performs the necessary regeneration
of the initial ramdisk (initrd) since plymouth is loaded
from the boot loader from the initrd prior to the mounting
of the root filesystem. The options available to this script
are explained in the OPTIONS paragraph.</p>

<p>In order for the configured default plymouth theme to be
loaded during boot, the option splash (or rhgb for backward
compatibility with the RHGB boot splash) must be provided at
the kernel command line. With this command line option,
plymouth will default to showing detailed boot output.</p>

<p>OPTIONS plymouth-set-default-theme follows the usual GNU
command line syntax, with long options starting with two
dashes (-) and short variants of each of them.</p>

<p>-h, --help Show summary of options.</p>

<p>-l, --list List available themes.</p>

<p>-r, --reset Reset to default theme.</p>

<p>-R, --rebuild-initrd Rebuild initrd (necessary after
changing theme).</p>

<p>&lt;theme-name&gt; Name of new theme to use. If you want
to see which themes are available, invoke the script with
just --list.</p>

<p>If plymouth-set-default-theme is invoked with no options
or parameters, it shows the currently selected theme by
default. This output is used by the helper scripts
plymouth-generate-initrd and plymouth-update- initrd to set
the proper theme in the initial ramdisk.</p>
