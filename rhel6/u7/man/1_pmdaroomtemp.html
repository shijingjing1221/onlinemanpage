<p>NAME pmdaroomtemp - room temperature performance metrics
domain agent (PMDA)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/roomtemp/pmdaroomtemp [-d
domain] [-l logfile]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pmdaroomtemp is a Performance Metrics Domain
Agent (PMDA) which exports the temperature from one or more
sensors built using the DS2480 and DS1280 chipsets and
MicroLAN technology from Dallas Semiconductor Cor-
poration.</p>

<p>The roomtemp PMDA exports metrics that reflect the
temperatures from one or more of these devices, in both
degrees Celcius and Fahrenheit. Each metric has one instance
for each temperature sensor device. The external instance
identifiers are the serial numbers (in hex) of the DS1280
chips discovered when the MicroLAN was probed.</p>

<p>A brief description of the pmdaroomtemp command line
options follows:</p>

<p>-d It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics
domain num- ber specified here is unique and consistent.
That is, domain should be different for every PMDA on the
one host, and the same domain number should be used for the
same PMDA on all hosts.</p>

<p>-l Location of the log file. By default, a log file
named roomtemp.log is written in the current directory of
pmcd(1) when pmdaroomtemp is started, i.e.
$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd. If the log file cannot be created or is
not writable, output is written to the standard error
instead.</p>

<p>INSTALLATION If you want access to the names, help text
and values for the roomtemp performance metrics, do the
following as root:</p>

<p># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/roomtemp # ./Install</p>

<p>If you want to undo the installation, do the following
as root:</p>

<p># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/roomtemp # ./Remove</p>

<p>pmdaroomtemp is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be
executed directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify
pmcd(1) when the agent is installed or removed.</p>

<p>FILES $PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH command line options used to
launch pmdaroomtemp $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/roomtemp/help default
help text file for the roomtemp metrics
$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/roomtemp/Install installation script for the
pmdaroomtemp agent $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/roomtemp/Remove undo
installation script for the pmdaroomtemp agent
$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/roomtemp.log default log file for error
messages and other information from pmdaroomtemp</p>

<p>PCP ENVIRONMENT Environment variables with the prefix
PCP_ are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP. On each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in pcp.conf(5).</p>
