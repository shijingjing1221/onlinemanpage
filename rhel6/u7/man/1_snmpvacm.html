<p>DESCRIPTION snmpvacm is an SNMP application that can be
used to do simple mainte- nance on the View-based Control
Module (VACM) tables of an SNMP agent. The SNMPv3 VACM
specifications (see RFC2575) define assorted tables to
specify groups of users, MIB views, and authorised access
settings. These snmpvacm commands effectively create or
delete rows in the appro- priate one of these tables, and
match the equivalent configure direc- tives which are
documented in the snmpd.conf(5) man page.</p>

<p>A fuller explanation of how these operate can be found
in the project FAQ.</p>

<p>SUB-COMMANDS createSec2Group MODEL SECURITYNAME
GROUPNAME Create an entry in the SNMPv3 security name to
group table. This table allows a single access control entry
to be applied to a number of users (or principals), and is
indexed by the security model and security name values.</p>

<p>MODEL</p>

<p>An integer representing the security model, taking one
of the following values: 1 - reserved for SNMPv1 2 -
reserved for SNMPv2c 3 - User-based Security Model (USM)</p>

<p>SECURITYNAME</p>

<p>A string representing the security name for a principal
(repre- sented in a security-model-independent format). For
USM-based requests, the security name is the same as the
username.</p>

<p>GROUPNAME</p>

<p>A string identifying the group that this entry (i.e.
security name/model pair) should belong to. This group name
will then be referenced in the access table (see
createAccess below).</p>

<p>deleteSec2Group MODEL SECURITYNAME Delete an entry from
the SNMPv3 security name to group table, thus removing
access control settings for the given principal. The entry
to be removed is indexed by the MODEL and SECURITYNAME
values, which should match those used in the corresponding
createSec2Group command (or equivalent).</p>

<p>createView [-Ce] NAME SUBTREE MASK Create an entry in
the SNMPv3 MIB view table. A MIB view consists of a family
of view subtrees which may be individually included in or
(occa- sionally) excluded from the view. Each view subtree
is defined by a combination of an OID subtree together with
a bit string mask. The view table is indexed by the view
name and subtree OID values.</p>

<p>[-Ce]</p>

<p>An optional flag to indicate that this view subtree
should be excluded from the named view. If not specified,
the default is to include the subtree in the view. When
constructing a view from a mixture of included and excluded
subtrees, the excluded subtrees should be defined first -
particularly if the named view is already referenced in one
or more access entries.</p>

<p>NAME</p>

<p>A string identifying a particular MIB view, of which
this OID subtree/mask forms part (possibly the only
part).</p>

<p>SUBTREE</p>

<p>The OID defining the root of the subtree to add to (or
exclude from) the named view.</p>

<p>MASK</p>

<p>A bit mask indicating which sub-identifiers of the
associated subtree OID should be regarded as
significant.</p>

<p>deleteView NAME SUBTREE Delete an entry from the SNMPv3
view table, thus removing the subtree from the given MIB
view. Removing the final (or only) subtree will result in
the deletion of the view. The entry to be removed is indexed
by the NAME and SUBTREE values, which should match those
used in the corresponding createView command (or
equivalent).</p>

<p>When removing subtrees from a mixed view (i.e.
containing both included and excluded subtrees), the
included subtrees should be removed first.</p>

<p>createAccess GROUPNAME [CONTEXTPREFIX] MODEL LEVEL
CONTEXTMATCH READVIEW WRITEVIEW NOTIFYVIEW Create an entry
in the SNMPv3 access table, thus allowing a certain level of
access to particular MIB views for the principals in the
spec- ified group (given suitable security model and levels
in the request). The access table is indexed by the group
name, context prefix, security model and security level
values.</p>

<p>GROUPNAME</p>

<p>The name of the group that this access entry applies to
(as set up by a createSec2Group command, or equivalent)</p>

<p>CONTEXTPREFIX</p>

<p>A string representing a context name (or collection of
context names) which this access entry applies to. The
interpretation of this string depends on the value of the
CONTEXTMATCH field (see below).</p>

<p>If omitted, this will default to the null context
&quot;&quot;.</p>

<p>MODEL</p>

<p>An integer representing the security model, taking one
of the following values: 1 - reserved for SNMPv1 2 -
reserved for SNMPv2c 3 - User-based Security Model (USM)</p>

<p>LEVEL</p>

<p>An integer representing the minimal security level,
taking one of the following values: 1 - noAuthNoPriv 2 -
authNoPriv 3 - authPriv</p>

<p>This access entry will be applied to requests of this
level or higher (where authPriv is higher than authNoPriv
which is in turn higher than noAuthNoPriv).</p>

<p>CONTEXTMATCH</p>

<p>Indicates how to interpret the CONTEXTPREFIX value. If
this field has the value 1 (representing exact) then the
context name of a request must match the CONTEXTPREFIX value
exactly for this access entry to be applicable to that
request.</p>

<p>If this field has the value 2 (representing prefix) then
the initial substring of the context name of a request must
match the CONTEXTPREFIX value for this access entry to be
applicable to that request. This provides a simple form of
wildcarding.</p>

<p>READVIEW</p>

<p>The name of the MIB view (as set up by createView or
equivalent) defining the MIB objects for which this request
may request the current values.</p>

<p>If there is no view with this name, then read access is
not granted.</p>

<p>WRITEVIEW</p>

<p>The name of the MIB view (as set up by createView or
equivalent) defining the MIB objects for which this request
may potentially SET new values.</p>

<p>If there is no view with this name, then read access is
not granted.</p>

<p>NOTIFYVIEW</p>

<p>The name of the MIB view (as set up by createView or
equivalent) defining the MIB objects which may be included
in notification request.</p>

<p>Note that this aspect of access control is not currently
sup- ported.</p>

<p>deleteAccess GROUPNAME [CONTEXTPREFIX] MODEL LEVEL
Delete an entry from the SNMPv3 access table, thus removing
the speci- fied access control settings. The entry to be
removed is indexed by the group name, context prefix,
security model and security level val- ues, which should
match those used in the corresponding createAccess command
(or equivalent).</p>

<p>createAuth GROUPNAME [CONTEXTPREFIX] MODEL LEVEL
AUTHTYPE CONTEXTMATCH VIEW Create an entry in the Net-SNMP
extension to the standard access table, thus allowing a
certain type of access to the MIB view for the princi- pals
in the specified group. The interpretation of GROUPNAME,
CON- TEXTPREFIX, MODEL, LEVEL and CONTEXTMATCH are the same
as for the cre- ateAccess directive. The extension access
table is indexed by the group name, context prefix, security
model, security level and authtype values.</p>

<p>AUTHTYPE</p>

<p>The style of access that this entry should be applied
to. See snmpd.conf(5) and snmptrapd.conf(5) for details of
valid tokens.</p>

<p>VIEW</p>

<p>The name of the MIB view (as set up by createView or
equivalent) defining the MIB objects for which this style of
access is authorized.</p>

<p>deleteAuth GROUPNAME [CONTEXTPREFIX] MODEL LEVEL
AUTHTYPE Delete an entry from the extension access table,
thus removing the specified access control settings. The
entry to be removed is indexed by the group name, context
prefix, security model, security level and authtype values,
which should match those used in the corresponding
createAuth command (or equivalent).</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Given a pre-existing user dave (which could be
set up using the snm- pusm(1) command), we could configure
full read-write access to the whole OID tree using the
commands:</p>

<p>snmpvacm localhost createSec2Group 3 dave RWGroup</p>

<p>snmpvacm localhost createView all .1 80</p>

<p>snmpvacm localhost createAccess RWGroup 3 1 1 all all
none</p>

<p>This creates a new security group named
&quot;RWGroup&quot; containing the SNMPv3 user
&quot;dave&quot;, a new view &quot;all&quot; containing the
full OID tree based on .iso(1) , and then allows those users
in the group &quot;RWGroup&quot; (i.e. &quot;dave&quot;)
both read- and write-access to the view &quot;all&quot;
(i.e. the full OID tree) when using authenticated SNMPv3
requests.</p>

<p>As a second example, we could set up read-only access to
a portion of the OID tree using the commands:</p>

<p>snmpvacm localhost createSec2Group 3 wes ROGroup</p>

<p>snmpvacm localhost createView sysView system fe</p>

<p>snmpvacm localhost createAccess ROGroup 3 0 1 sysView
none none</p>

<p>This creates a new security group named
&quot;ROGroup&quot; containing the (pre- existing) user
&quot;wes&quot;, a new view &quot;sysView&quot; containing
just the OID tree based on
.iso(1).org(3).dod(6).inet(1).mgmt(2).mib-2(1).system(1) ,
and then allows those users in the group &quot;ROGroup&quot;
(i.e. &quot;wes&quot;) read- access, but not write-access to
the view &quot;sysView&quot; (i.e. the system group).</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values are returned:</p>

<p>0 - Successful completion</p>

<p>1 - A usage syntax error (which displays a suitable
usage message) or a request timeout.</p>

<p>2 - An error occurred while executing the command (which
also displays a suitable error message).</p>

<p>LIMITATIONS This utility does not support the
configuration of new community strings, so is only of use
for setting up new access control for SNMPv3 requests. It
can be used to amend the access settings for existing
community strings, but not to set up new ones.</p>

<p>The use of numeric parameters for secLevel and
contextMatch parameters is less than intuitive. These
commands do not provide the full flexi- bility of the
equivalent config file directives.</p>

<p>There is (currently) no equivalent to the one-shot
configure directives rouser and rwuser.</p>
