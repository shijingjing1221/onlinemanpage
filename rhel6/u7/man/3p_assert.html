<p>ASSERT(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual ASSERT(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME assert - insert program diagnostics</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;assert.h&gt;</p>

<p>void assert(scalar expression);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The assert() macro shall insert diagnostics
into programs; it shall expand to a void expression. When it
is executed, if expression (which shall have a scalar type)
is false (that is, compares equal to 0), assert() shall
write information about the particular call that failed on
stderr and shall call abort().</p>

<p>The information written about the call that failed shall
include the text of the argument, the name of the source
file, the source file line number, and the name of the
enclosing function; the latter are, respec- tively, the
values of the preprocessing macros __FILE__ and __LINE__ and
of the identifier __func__.</p>

<p>Forcing a definition of the name NDEBUG, either from the
compiler com- mand line or with the preprocessor control
statement #define NDEBUG ahead of the #include
&lt;assert.h&gt; statement, shall stop assertions from being
compiled into the program.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The assert() macro shall not return a
value.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
