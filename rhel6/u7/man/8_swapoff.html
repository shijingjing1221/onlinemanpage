<p>SWAPON(8) Linux Programmer s Manual SWAPON(8)</p>

<p>NAME swapon, swapoff - enable/disable devices and files
for paging and swap- ping</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS Get info: swapon -s [-h] [-V]</p>

<p>Enable/disable: swapon [-f] [-p priority] [-v]
specialfile... swapoff [-v] specialfile...</p>

<p>Enable/disable all: swapon -a [-e] [-f] [-v] swapoff -a
[-v]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION swapon is used to specify devices on which
paging and swapping are to take place.</p>

<p>The device or file used is given by the specialfile
parameter. It may be of the form -L label or -U uuid to
indicate a device by label or uuid.</p>

<p>Calls to swapon normally occur in the system boot
scripts making all swap devices available, so that the
paging and swapping activity is interleaved across several
devices and files.</p>

<p>swapoff disables swapping on the specified devices and
files. When the -a flag is given, swapping is disabled on
all known swap devices and files (as found in /proc/swaps or
/etc/fstab).</p>

<p>-a, --all All devices marked as swap in /etc/fstab are
made available, except for those with the noauto option.
Devices that are already being used as swap are silently
skipped.</p>

<p>-e, --ifexists Silently skip devices that do not
exist.</p>

<p>-f, --fixpgsz Reinitialize (exec /sbin/mkswap) the swap
space if its page size does not match that of the the
current running kernel. mkswap(2) initializes the whole
device and does not check for bad blocks.</p>

<p>-h, --help Provide help.</p>

<p>-L label Use the partition that has the specified label.
(For this, access to /proc/partitions is needed.)</p>

<p>-p, --priority priority Specify the priority of the swap
device. priority is a value between 0 and 32767. Higher
numbers indicate higher priority. See swapon(2) for a full
description of swap priorities. Add pri=value to the option
field of /etc/fstab for use with swapon -a.</p>

<p>-s, --summary Display swap usage summary by device.
Equivalent to &quot;cat /proc/swaps&quot;. Not available
before Linux 2.1.25.</p>

<p>-U uuid Use the partition that has the specified
uuid.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose Be verbose.</p>

<p>-V, --version Display version.</p>

<p>NOTES You should not use swapon on a file with holes.
Swap over NFS may not work.</p>

<p>swapon automatically detects and rewrites swap space
signature with old software suspend data (e.g S1SUSPEND,
S2SUSPEND, ...). The problem is that if we dont do it, then
we get data corruption the next time an attempt at
unsuspending is made.</p>

<p>HISTORY The swapon command appeared in 4.0BSD.</p>

<p>AVAILABILITY The swapon command is part of the
util-linux-ng package and is avail- able from
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux-ng/.</p>
