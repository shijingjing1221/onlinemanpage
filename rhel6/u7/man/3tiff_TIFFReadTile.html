<p>NAME TIFFReadTile - read and decode a tile of data from
an open TIFF file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tiffio.h&gt;</p>

<p>tsize_t TIFFReadTile(TIFF *tif, tdata_t buf, uint32 x,
uint32 y, uint32 z, tsample_t sample)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Return the data for the tile containing the
specified coordinates. The data placed in buf are returned
decompressed and, typically, in the native byte- and
bit-ordering, but are otherwise packed (see further below).
The buffer must be large enough to hold an entire tile of
data. Applications should call the routine TIFFTileSize to
find out the size (in bytes) of a tile buffer. The x and y
parameters are always used by TIFFReadTile. The z parameter
is used if the image is deeper than 1 slice
(ImageDepth&gt;1). The sample parameter is used only if data
are organized in separate planes
(PlanarConfiguration=2).</p>

<p>NOTES The library attempts to hide bit- and
byte-ordering differences between the image and the native
machine by converting data to the native machine order. Bit
reversal is done if the FillOrder tag is opposite to the
native machine bit order. 16- and 32-bit samples are
automati- cally byte-swapped if the file was written with a
byte order opposite to the native machine byte order,</p>

<p>RETURN VALUES TIFFReadTile returns -1 if it detects an
error; otherwise the number of bytes in the decoded tile is
returned.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS All error messages are directed to the
TIFFError(3TIFF) routine.</p>
