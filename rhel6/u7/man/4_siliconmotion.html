<p>NAME siliconmotion - Silicon Motion video driver</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS Section &quot;Device&quot; Identifier
&quot;devname&quot; Driver &quot;siliconmotion&quot; ... [
Option &quot;optionname&quot; [&quot;optionvalue&quot;]]
EndSection</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION siliconmotion is an Xorg driver for Silicon
Motion based video cards. The driver is fully accelerated,
and provides support for the following framebuffer depths:
8, 16, and 24. All visual types are supported for depth 8,
and TrueColor visuals are supported for the other
depths.</p>

<p>SUPPORTED HARDWARE The siliconmotion driver supports PCI
and AGP video cards based on the following Silicon Motion
chips:</p>

<p>Lynx SM910</p>

<p>LynxE SM810</p>

<p>Lynx3D SM820</p>

<p>LynxEM SM710</p>

<p>LynxEM+ SM712</p>

<p>Lynx3DM SM720</p>

<p>Cougar3DR SM731</p>

<p>MSOC SM501,SM502</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION DETAILS Please refer to xorg.conf(5) for
general configuration details. This section only covers
configuration details specific to this driver. All options
names are case and white space insensitive when parsed by
the server, for example, &quot;lynxe&quot; and
&quot;LynxE&quot; are equivalent.</p>

<p>Multihead mode configuration is done through the
RandR1.2 interface (see xorg.conf(5) and xrandr(1) for
further information). Hardware accelerated screen rotation
and framebuffer resizing are only supported with the EXA
acceleration architecture (see the AccelMethod option
below).</p>

<p>The driver auto-detects the chipset type, but the
following ChipSet names may optionally be specified in the
config file &quot;Device&quot; section, and will override
the auto-detection:</p>

<p>&quot;lynx&quot;, &quot;lynxe&quot;, &quot;lynx3d&quot;,
&quot;lynxem&quot;, &quot;lynxem+&quot;,
&quot;lynx3dm&quot;, &quot;cougar3dr&quot;,
&quot;msoc&quot;.</p>

<p>The following Cursor Options are supported:</p>

<p>Option &quot;HWCursor&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Enable
or disable the HW cursor. Default: on.</p>

<p>Option &quot;SWCursor&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Inverse
of &quot;HWCursor&quot;. Default: off.</p>

<p>The following display Options are supported:</p>

<p>Option &quot;VideoKey&quot; &quot;integer&quot; Set the
video color key. Default: a little off full blue.</p>

<p>Option &quot;ByteSwap&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Turn on
byte swapping for capturing using SMI demo board. Default:
off.</p>

<p>Option &quot;Interlaced&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Turn
on interlaced video capturing. Default: off.</p>

<p>Option &quot;UseBIOS&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Use the
BIOS to set the modes. This is used for custom panel
timings. Default: off for SM72x and SM5xx, otherwise on.</p>

<p>Option &quot;Dualhead&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Enable
dualhead mode. Currently not all chips are supported and
hardware video overlay (XV) support may have some
limitations. Default: off.</p>

<p>Option &quot;PanelSize&quot; &quot;widthxheight&quot;
Override LCD panel dimension autodetection.</p>

<p>Option &quot;UseFBDev&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Don t
actually program the hardware mode registers, but leave it
as set by the operating system. Only available on MSOC
chips. Default: off.</p>

<p>Option &quot;CSCVideo&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; CSC
video uses color space conversion to render video directly
to the framebuffer, without using an overlay. Only available
on MSOC chips. Default: on.</p>

<p>The following video memory Options are supported:</p>

<p>Option &quot;mclk&quot; &quot;integer&quot; Sets the
memory clock. You must specify the units. For example 50Mhz
is the same as 50000Khz or 50000000Hz. On MSOC chips this is
the main clock source for all functional blocks, such as the
2D engine, GPIO, Video Engine, and DMA Engine. This option
is only used for debugging purposes on MSOC chips. Default:
probe the memory clock value, and use it at server
start.</p>

<p>Option &quot;mxclk&quot; &quot;integer&quot; Sets the
memory clock. You must specify the units. For example 50Mhz
is the same as 50000Khz or 50000000Hz. Clock source for the
local SDRAM controller. This option is only available on
MSOC chips and used only for debugging purposes. Default:
probe the memory clock value, and use it at server
start.</p>

<p>The following acceleration and graphics engine Options
are supported:</p>

<p>Option &quot;NoAccel&quot; Disable acceleration. Very
useful for determining if the driver has problems with
drawing and acceleration routines. This is the first option
to try if your server runs but you see graphic corruption on
the screen. Using it decreases performance, as it uses
software emulation for drawing operations the video driver
can accelerate with hardware. Default: acceleration is
enabled.</p>

<p>Option &quot;AccelMethod&quot; &quot;string&quot;
Chooses between available acceleration architectures. Valid
options are XAA and EXA. XAA is the traditional acceleration
architecture and support for it is very stable. EXA is a
newer acceleration architecture with better performance for
the Render and Composite extensions, but the rendering code
for it is newer and possibly unstable. The default is
XAA.</p>

<p>The following PCI bus Options are supported:</p>

<p>Option &quot;PciBurst&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; will
enable PCI burst mode. This should work on all but a few
broken PCI chipsets, and will increase performance. Default:
on.</p>

<p>Option &quot;PciRetry&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; will
allow the driver to rely on PCI Retry to program the regis-
ters. PciBurst must be enabled for this to work. This will
increase performance, especially for small fills/blits,
because the driver does not have to poll the card before
sending it com- mands to make sure it is ready. It should
work on most recent PCI chipsets. Default: value of PciBurst
option.</p>

<p>SUPPORT For assistance with this driver, or Xorg in
general, check the web site at http://www.x.org/. If you
find a problem with Xorg or have a ques- tion not answered
in the FAQ please use our bug report form available on the
web site or send mail to xorg@lists.freedesktop.org. When
reporting problems with the driver send as much detail as
possible, including chipset type, a server output log, and
operating system specifics.</p>
