<p>DROPUSER(1) PostgreSQL Client Applications
DROPUSER(1)</p>

<p>NAME dropuser - remove a PostgreSQL user account</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS dropuser [ option... ] [ username ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION dropuser removes an existing PostgreSQL
user. Only superusers and users with the CREATEROLE
privilege can remove PostgreSQL users. (To remove a
superuser, you must yourself be a superuser.)</p>

<p>dropuser is a wrapper around the SQL command DROP ROLE
[drop_role(7)]. There is no effective difference between
dropping users via this util- ity and via other methods for
accessing the server.</p>

<p>OPTIONS dropuser accepts the following command-line
arguments:</p>

<p>username Specifies the name of the PostgreSQL user to be
removed. You will be prompted for a name if none is
specified on the command line.</p>

<p>-e</p>

<p>--echo Echo the commands that dropuser generates and
sends to the server.</p>

<p>-i</p>

<p>--interactive Prompt for confirmation before actually
removing the user.</p>

<p>dropuser also accepts the following command-line
arguments for connec- tion parameters:</p>

<p>-h host</p>

<p>--host host Specifies the host name of the machine on
which the server is running. If the value begins with a
slash, it is used as the directory for the Unix domain
socket.</p>

<p>-p port</p>

<p>--port port Specifies the TCP port or local Unix domain
socket file exten- sion on which the server is listening for
connections.</p>

<p>-U username</p>

<p>--username username User name to connect as (not the
user name to drop).</p>

<p>-w</p>

<p>--no-password Never issue a password prompt. If the
server requires password authentication and a password is
not available by other means such as a .pgpass file, the
connection attempt will fail. This option can be useful in
batch jobs and scripts where no user is present to enter a
password.</p>

<p>-W</p>

<p>--password Force dropuser to prompt for a password
before connecting to a database.</p>

<p>This option is never essential, since dropuser will
automati- cally prompt for a password if the server demands
password authentication. However, dropuser will waste a
connection attempt finding out that the server wants a
password. In some cases it is worth typing -W to avoid the
extra connection attempt.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT PGHOST</p>

<p>PGPORT</p>

<p>PGUSER Default connection parameters</p>

<p>This utility, like most other PostgreSQL utilities, also
uses the envi- ronment variables supported by libpq (see in
the documentation).</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS In case of difficulty, see DROP ROLE
[drop_role(7)] and psql(1) for discussions of potential
problems and error messages. The database server must be
running at the targeted host. Also, any default connec- tion
settings and environment variables used by the libpq
front-end library will apply.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES To remove user joe from the default database
server:</p>

<p>$ dropuser joe</p>

<p>To remove user joe using the server on host eden, port
5000, with veri- fication and a peek at the underlying
command:</p>

<p>$ dropuser -p 5000 -h eden -i -e joe Role
&quot;joe&quot; will be permanently removed. Are you sure?
(y/n) y DROP ROLE joe;</p>
