<p>NAME menubutton - Create and manipulate menubutton
widgets</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS menubutton pathName ?options?</p>

<p>STANDARD OPTIONS -activebackground -disabledforeground
-padx -activeforeground -font -pady -anchor -foreground
-relief -background -highlightbackground -takefocus -bitmap
-highlightcolor -text -borderwidth -highlightthickness
-textvariable -cursor -image -underline -compound -justify
-wraplength</p>

<p>See the options manual entry for details on the standard
options.</p>

<p>WIDGET-SPECIFIC OPTIONS Command-Line Name:-direction
Database Name: direction Database Class: Height</p>

<p>Specifies where the menu is going to be popup up. above
tries to pop the menu above the menubutton. below tries to
pop the menu below the menubutton. left tries to pop the
menu to the left of the menubutton. right tries to pop the
menu to the right of the menu button. flush pops the menu
directly over the menubutton. In the case of above or below,
the direction will be reversed if the menu would show
offscreen.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-height Database Name: height Database
Class: Height</p>

<p>Specifies a desired height for the menubutton. If an
image or bitmap is being displayed in the menubutton then
the value is in screen units (i.e. any of the forms
acceptable to Tk_GetPixels); for text it is in lines of
text. If this option is not speci- fied, the menubuttons
desired height is computed from the size of the image or
bitmap or text being displayed in it.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-indicatoron Database Name:
indicatorOn Database Class: IndicatorOn</p>

<p>The value must be a proper boolean value. If it is true
then a small indicator rectangle will be displayed on the
right side of the menubutton and the default menu bindings
will treat this as an option menubutton. If false then no
indicator will be dis- played.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-menu Database Name: menu Database
Class: MenuName</p>

<p>Specifies the path name of the menu associated with this
menubutton. The menu must be a child of the menubutton.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-state Database Name: state Database
Class: State</p>

<p>Specifies one of three states for the menubutton:
normal, active, or disabled. In normal state the menubutton
is dis- played using the foreground and background options.
The active state is typically used when the pointer is over
the menubutton. In active state the menubutton is displayed
using the active- Foreground and activeBackground options.
Disabled state means that the menubutton should be
insensitive: the default bindings will refuse to activate
the widget and will ignore mouse button presses. In this
state the disabledForeground and background options
determine how the button is displayed.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-width Database Name: width Database
Class: Width</p>

<p>Specifies a desired width for the menubutton. If an
image or bitmap is being displayed in the menubutton then
the value is in screen units (i.e. any of the forms
acceptable to Tk_GetPixels); for text it is in characters.
If this option is not specified, the menubuttons desired
width is computed from the size of the image or bitmap or
text being displayed in it.

<p>INTRODUCTION The menubutton command creates a new window
(given by the pathName argument) and makes it into a
menubutton widget. Additional options, described above, may
be specified on the command line or in the option database
to configure aspects of the menubutton such as its colors,
font, text, and initial relief. The menubutton command
returns its pathName argument. At the time this command is
invoked, there must not exist a window named pathName, but
pathNames parent must exist.</p>

<p>A menubutton is a widget that displays a textual string,
bitmap, or image and is associated with a menu widget. If
text is displayed, it must all be in a single font, but it
can occupy multiple lines on the screen (if it contains
newlines or if wrapping occurs because of the wrapLength
option) and one of the characters may optionally be under-
lined using the underline option. In normal usage, pressing
mouse but- ton 1 over the menubutton causes the associated
menu to be posted just underneath the menubutton. If the
mouse is moved over the menu before releasing the mouse
button, the button release causes the underlying menu entry
to be invoked. When the button is released, the menu is
unposted.</p>

<p>Menubuttons are typically organized into groups called
menu bars that allow scanning: if the mouse button is
pressed over one menubutton (causing it to post its menu)
and the mouse is moved over another menubutton in the same
menu bar without releasing the mouse button, then the menu
of the first menubutton is unposted and the menu of the new
menubutton is posted instead.</p>

<p>There are several interactions between menubuttons and
menus; see the menu manual entry for information on various
menu configurations, such as pulldown menus and option
menus.</p>

<p>WIDGET COMMAND The menubutton command creates a new Tcl
command whose name is path- Name. This command may be used
to invoke various operations on the widget. It has the
following general form: pathName option ?arg arg ...? Option
and the args determine the exact behavior of the command.
The following commands are possible for menubutton
widgets:</p>

<p>pathName cget option Returns the current value of the
configuration option given by option. Option may have any of
the values accepted by the menubutton command.</p>

<p>pathName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?
Query or modify the configuration options of the widget. If
no option is specified, returns a list describing all of the
avail- able options for pathName (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for
information on the format of this list). If option is
specified with no value, then the command returns a list
describing the one named option (this list will be identical
to the corresponding sublist of the value returned if no
option is specified). If one or more option-value pairs are
specified, then the command modifies the given widget
option(s) to have the given value(s); in this case the
command returns an empty string. Option may have any of the
values accepted by the menubutton command.</p>

<p>DEFAULT BINDINGS Tk automatically creates class bindings
for menubuttons that give them the following default
behavior:</p>

<p>[1] A menubutton activates whenever the mouse passes
over it and deactivates whenever the mouse leaves it.</p>

<p>[2] Pressing mouse button 1 over a menubutton posts the
menubutton: its relief changes to raised and its associated
menu is posted under the menubutton. If the mouse is dragged
down into the menu with the button still down, and if the
mouse button is then released over an entry in the menu, the
menubutton is unposted and the menu entry is invoked.</p>

<p>[3] If button 1 is pressed over a menubutton and then
released over that menubutton, the menubutton stays posted:
you can still move the mouse over the menu and click button
1 on an entry to invoke it. Once a menu entry has been
invoked, the menubutton unposts itself.</p>

<p>[4] If button 1 is pressed over a menubutton and then
dragged over some other menubutton, the original menubutton
unposts itself and the new menubutton posts.</p>

<p>[5] If button 1 is pressed over a menubutton and
released outside any menubutton or menu, the menubutton
unposts without invoking any menu entry.</p>

<p>[6] When a menubutton is posted, its associated menu
claims the input focus to allow keyboard traversal of the
menu and its sub- menus. See the menu manual entry for
details on these bindings.</p>

<p>[7] If the underline option has been specified for a
menubutton then keyboard traversal may be used to post the
menubutton: Alt+x, where x is the underlined character (or
its lower-case or upper- case equivalent), may be typed in
any window under the menubut- tons toplevel to post the
menubutton.</p>

<p>[8] The F10 key may be typed in any window to post the
first menubutton under its toplevel window that is not
disabled.</p>

<p>[9] If a menubutton has the input focus, the space and
return keys post the menubutton.</p>

<p>If the menubuttons state is disabled then none of the
above actions occur: the menubutton is completely
non-responsive.</p>

<p>The behavior of menubuttons can be changed by defining
new bindings for individual widgets or by redefining the
class bindings.</p>
