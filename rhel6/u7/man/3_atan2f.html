<p>ATAN2(3) Linux Programmer s Manual ATAN2(3)</p>

<p>NAME atan2, atan2f, atan2l - arc tangent function of two
variables</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;math.h&gt;</p>

<p>double atan2(double y, double x); float atan2f(float y,
float x); long double atan2l(long double y, long double
x);</p>

<p>Link with -lm.</p>

<p>Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
feature_test_macros(7)):</p>

<p>atan2f(), atan2l(): _BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE ||
_XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;= 600 || _ISOC99_SOURCE; or cc
-std=c99</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The atan2() function calculates the
principal value of the arc tangent of y/x, using the signs
of the two arguments to determine the quadrant of the
result.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, these functions return the
principal value of the arc tan- gent of y/x in radians; the
return value is in the range [-pi, pi].</p>

<p>If y is +0 (-0) and x is less than 0, +pi (-pi) is
returned.</p>

<p>If y is +0 (-0) and x is greater than 0, +0 (-0) is
returned.</p>

<p>If y is less than 0 and x is +0 or -0, -pi/2 is
returned.</p>

<p>If y is greater than 0 and x is +0 or -0, pi/2 is
returned.</p>

<p>If either x or y is NaN, a NaN is returned.</p>

<p>If y is +0 (-0) and x is -0, +pi (-pi) is returned.</p>

<p>If y is +0 (-0) and x is +0, +0 (-0) is returned.</p>

<p>If y is a finite value greater (less) than 0, and x is
negative infin- ity, +pi (-pi) is returned.</p>

<p>If y is a finite value greater (less) than 0, and x is
positive infin- ity, +0 (-0) is returned.</p>

<p>If y is positive infinity (negative infinity), and x is
finite, pi/2 (-pi/2) is returned.</p>

<p>If y is positive infinity (negative infinity) and x is
negative infin- ity, +3*pi/4 (-3*pi/4) is returned.</p>

<p>If y is positive infinity (negative infinity) and x is
positive infin- ity, +pi/4 (-pi/4) is returned.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors occur.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO C99, POSIX.1-2001. The variant returning
double also conforms to SVr4, 4.3BSD, C89.</p>
