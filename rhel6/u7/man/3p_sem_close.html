<p>SEM_CLOSE(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
SEM_CLOSE(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME sem_close - close a named semaphore (REALTIME)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;semaphore.h&gt;</p>

<p>int sem_close(sem_t *sem);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sem_close() function shall indicate that
the calling process is finished using the named semaphore
indicated by sem. The effects of calling sem_close() for an
unnamed semaphore (one created by sem_init()) are undefined.
The sem_close() function shall deallocate (that is, make
available for reuse by a subsequent sem_open() by this
process) any system resources allocated by the system for
use by this process for this semaphore. The effect of
subsequent use of the semaphore indicated by sem by this
process is undefined. If the semaphore has not been removed
with a successful call to sem_unlink(), then sem_close() has
no effect on the state of the semaphore. If the sem_unlink()
function has been successfully invoked for name after the
most recent call to sem_open() with O_CREAT for this
semaphore, then when all processes that have opened the
semaphore close it, the semaphore is no longer
accessible.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, a value of zero
shall be returned. Other- wise, a value of -1 shall be
returned and errno set to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The sem_close() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The sem argument is not a valid semaphore
descriptor.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The sem_close() function is part of
the Semaphores option and need not be available on all
implementations.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
