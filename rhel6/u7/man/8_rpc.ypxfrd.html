<p>NAME rpc.ypxfrd - NIS map transfer server</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS /usr/sbin/rpc.ypxfrd [ -d path ] [ -p port ] [
--debug ] /usr/sbin/rpc.ypxfrd --version</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION rpc.ypxfrd is used for speed up the transfer
of very large NIS maps from a NIS master to the NIS slave
server. If a NIS slave server receives a message that there
is a new map, it will start ypxfr for transfering the new
map. ypxfr will read the contents of a map from the master
server using the yp_all() function. This process can take
several minutes when there are very large maps which have to
be stored by the database library.</p>

<p>The rpc.ypxfrd server speeds up the transfer process by
allowing NIS slave servers to simply copy the master servers
map files rather than building their own from scratch.
rpc.ypxfrd uses an RPC-based file transfer protocol, so that
there is no need for building a new map.</p>

<p>rpc.ypxfrd could be started by inetd. But since it
starts very slowly, it should be started after ypserv from
/etc/init.d/ypxfrd.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --debug Causes the server to run in debugging
mode. In debug mode, the server does not background itself
and prints extra status mes- sages to stderr for each
request that it revceives.</p>

<p>-d directory rpc.ypxfrd is using this directory instead
of /var/yp</p>

<p>-p port rpc.ypxfrd will bind itself to this port, which
makes it possi- ble to have a router filter packets to the
NIS ports. This can restricted the access to the NIS server
from hosts on the Inter- net.</p>

<p>--version Prints the version number</p>

<p>SECURITY rpc.ypxfrd uses the same functions for checking
a host as ypserv. At first, rpc.ypxfrd will check a request
from an address with /var/yp/securenets or the tcp wrapper.
If the host is allowed to con- nect to the server,
rpc.ypxfrd will uses the rules from /etc/ypserv.conf to
check the requested map. If a mapname doesnt match a rule,
rpc.ypxfrd will look for the YP_SECURE key in the map. If it
exists, rpc.ypxfrd will only allow requests on a reserved
port.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/ypserv.conf /var/yp/securenets</p>

<p>BUGS The FreeBSD ypxfrd protocol is not compatible with
that used by SunOS. This is unfortunate but unavoidable:
Suns protocol is not freely available, and even if it were
it would probably not be useful since the SunOS NIS v2
implimentation uses the original ndbm package for its map
databases whereas the other implimentation uses GNU DBM or
Berkeley DB. These packages uses vastly different file
formats. Furthermore, ndbm and gdbm are byte-order sensitive
and not very smart about it, meaning that a gdbm or ndbm
database created on a big endian system cant be read on a
little endian system. The FreeBSD ypxfrd protocol checks, if
both, master and slave, uses the same database packages and,
if necessary, the byte order of the system.</p>
