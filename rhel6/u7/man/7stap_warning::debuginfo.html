<p>NAME warning::debuginfo - systemtap missing-debuginfo
warnings</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION For many symbolic probing operations,
systemtap needs DWARF debuginfo for the relevant binaries.
This often includes resolving func- tion/statement probes,
or $context variables in related handlers. DWARF debuginfo
may be found in the original binaries built during com-
pilation, or may have been split into separate files. The
SYSTEM- TAP_DEBUGINFO_PATH environment variable affects
where systemtap looks for these files.</p>

<p>If your operating system came from a distributor, check
with them if debuginfo packages or variants are available.
If your distributor does not have debuginfo-equipped
binaries at all, you may need to rebuild it.</p>

<p>Systemtap uses the elfutils library to process ELF/DWARF
files. The version of elfutils used by systemtap is the
number after the slash in the -V output:</p>

<p>% stap -V Systemtap translator/driver (version
2.3/0.156, rpm 2.3-1.fc19) Copyright (C) 2005-2014 Red Hat,
Inc. and others [...]</p>

<p>This indicates systemtap version 2.3 with elfutils
version 0.156.</p>

<p>kernel debuginfo For scripts that target the kernel,
systemtap may search for the vmlinux file created during its
original build. This is dis- tinct from the boot-loader s
compressed/stripped vmlinuz file, and much larger. If you
have a hand-built kernel, make sure it was built with the
CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO=y option.</p>

<p>process debuginfo For scripts that target user-space,
systemtap may search for de- buginfo. If you have hand-built
binaries, use CFLAGS=-g -O2 to compile them.</p>

<p>minidebuginfo On some systems, binaries may be compiled
with a subset of de- buginfo useful for function tracing and
backtraces. This Minidebuginfo is a xz compressed section
labeled .gnu_debugda- ta. Support for minidebuginfo relies
on elfutils version 0.156 or later.</p>

<p>compressed debuginfo On some systems, debuginfo may be
available, but compressed into .zdebug_* sections. Support
for compressed debuginfo relies on elfutils version 0.153 or
later.</p>

<p>unnecessary debuginfo In some cases, a script may be
altered to avoid requiring debug- info. For example, as
script that uses probe syscall.* probes could try instead
probe nd_syscall.* (for non-DWARF syscall): these work
similarly, and use more intricate (fragile) tapset functions
to extract system call arguments. Another option is use of
compiled-in instrumentation such as kernel tracepoints or
user-space &lt;sys/sdt.h&gt; markers in libraries or
executables, which do not require debuginfo. If debuginfo
was required for resolving a complicated
$var-&gt;foo-&gt;bar expression, it may be possible to use
@cast(var,&quot;foo&quot;,&quot;foo.h&quot;)-&gt;foo-&gt;bar
to synthesize debuginfo for that type from a header
file.</p>

<p>AUTOMATION On some platforms, systemtap may advise what
commands to run, in order to download needed debuginfo.
Another possibility is to invoke system- tap with the
--download-debuginfo flag. The stap-prep script included
with systemtap may be able to download the appropriate
kernel debugin- fo. Another possibility is to install and
use a stap-server remote- compilation instance on a machine
on your network, where debuginfo and compilation resources
can be centralized. Try the stap --use-server option, in
case such a server is already running.</p>
