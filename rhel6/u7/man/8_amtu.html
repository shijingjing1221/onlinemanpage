<p>NAME amtu - Abstract Machine Test Utility (AMTU)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS amtu [-dmsinph]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Abstract Machine Test Utility (AMTU) is an
administrative utility that checks whether the underlying
protection mechanisms of the hardware are being enforced.
These checks are a requirement of the Controlled Access
Protection Profile (CAPP) FPT_AMT.1 (see
http://www.radium.ncsc.mil/tpep/library/protection_pro-
files/CAPP-1.d.pdf).</p>

<p>AMTU executes the following tests:</p>

<p>* Memory Randomly writes to areas of memory, then reads
the memory back to ensure the values written remain
unchanged.</p>

<p>* Memory Separation Ensures that user space programs
cannot read and write to areas of memory utilized by items
such as Video RAM and kernel code.</p>

<p>* I/O Controller - Network Verifies random data
transmitted is also the data received for each configured
network device. Checks only Ethernet and token ring devices
that are configured and up. Does not check async
devices.</p>

<p>* I/O Controller - Disk Verifies random data written to
disks remains unchanged. Only IDE and SCI controllers that
are associated with mounted file systems are checked. Disk
controllers with read-only mounted file systems are not
checked.</p>

<p>* Supervisor Mode Instructions Ensures that the
enforcement of the property that privileged instructions
should only be in supervisor mode is still in effect. The
set of privileged instructions tested to confirm this is
architecture dependent.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Options available for the amtu command are the
following:</p>

<p>-d Print debug messages.</p>

<p>-m Execute Memory Test.</p>

<p>-s Execute Memory Separation Test.</p>

<p>-i Execute I/O Controller - Disk Test.</p>

<p>-n Execute I/O Controller - Network Test</p>

<p>-p Execute Supervisor Mode Instructions Test.</p>

<p>-h Print help message.</p>

<p>RETURN CODES The amtu command issues the following
return codes when executed:</p>

<p>-1 Failure</p>

<p>0 Success.</p>
