<p>sane-dmc(5) SANE Scanner Access Now Easy sane-dmc(5)</p>

<p>NAME sane-dmc - SANE backend for the Polaroid Digital
Microscope Camera</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sane-dmc library implements a SANE
(Scanner Access Now Easy) back- end that provides access to
the Polaroid Digital Microscope Camera.</p>

<p>DEVICE NAMES This backend expects device names of the
form:</p>

<p>special</p>

<p>Where special is the UNIX path-name for the special
device that corre- sponds to the scanner. The special device
name must be a generic SCSI device or a symlink to such a
device. Under Linux, such a device name could be /dev/sga or
/dev/sge, for example.</p>

<p>IMAGING MODES The Polaroid DMC supports a number of
imaging modes. This driver sup- ports five of the imaging
modes:</p>

<p>Full Frame This mode corresponds to the 801-by-600 pixel
full-color full- frame image.</p>

<p>Viewfinder This mode corresponds to the 270-by-201 pixel
grey-scale viewfinder image. This image is acquired very
quickly.</p>

<p>Raw This mode corresponds to the 1599-by-600 pixel
&quot;raw&quot; image from the CCD. It is grey-scale, with
pixels alternating horizontally between red, green and blue
stripes. The pixels are twice as high as they are wide, so
the image is distorted.</p>

<p>Thumbnail This mode corresponds to the 80-by-60 pixel
full-color thumbnail image.</p>

<p>Super Resolution This image is a 1599-by-1200 pixel
full-color image constructed by filtering and interpolating
the &quot;raw&quot; image. The filtering and interpolation
is done in software, so this mode is very slow. Also, this
mode places restrictions on how the image is read which
means that the &quot;preview&quot; mode of xscanimage does
not work in Super Resolution mode. (xcam and the non-preview
modes of scanimage and xscanimage work fine, however.)</p>

<p>OTHER SETTINGS ASA Setting This setting adjusts the
cameras sensitivity. You can choose one of 25, 50, or 100
&quot;equivalent&quot; ASA.</p>

<p>Shutter Speed You can select a shutter speed from 8 to
1000 milliseconds. The shutter speed is quantized in units
of 32 microseconds.</p>

<p>White Balance You can choose one of
&quot;Daylight&quot;, &quot;Incandescent&quot; or
&quot;Fluores- cent&quot; white balances. This setting
more-or-less corresponds to the &quot;Color
Temperature&quot; settings on Polaroid s Windows and Mac
software.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION The contents of the dmc.conf file is a
list of device names that corre- spond to DMC scanners.
Empty lines and lines starting with a hash mark (#) are
ignored. A sample configuration file is shown below:</p>

<p>/dev/scanner # this is a comment /dev/sge</p>

<p>FILES /etc/sane.d/dmc.conf The backend configuration
file (see also description of SANE_CONFIG_DIR below).</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-dmc.a The static library
implementing this backend.</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-dmc.so The shared library
implementing this backend (present on systems that support
dynamic loading).</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT SANE_CONFIG_DIR This environment variable
specifies the list of directories that may contain the
configuration file. Under UNIX, the directories are
separated by a colon (:), under OS/2, they are separated by
a semi-colon (;). If this variable is not set, the config-
uration file is searched in two default directories: first,
the current working directory (&quot;.&quot;) and then in
/etc/sane.d. If the value of the environment variable ends
with the directory sepa- rator character, then the default
directories are searched after the explicitly specified
directories. For example, setting SANE_CONFIG_DIR to
&quot;/tmp/config:&quot; would result in directories
&quot;tmp/config&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and
&quot;/etc/sane.d&quot; being searched (in this order).</p>

<p>SANE_DEBUG_DMC If the library was compiled with debug
support enabled, this environment variable controls the
debug level for this backend. E.g., a value of 128 requests
all debug output to be printed. Smaller levels reduce
verbosity.</p>

<p>BUGS In the &quot;Full Frame&quot; and &quot;Raw&quot;
modes, images must be read in units of entire lines. The
driver performs no buffering in these modes; if you ask
sane_read to read a non-integral number of lines, it may
read less than you ask for. If you ask sane_read to read
less than a single line, it returns SANE_STATUS_INVAL.</p>

<p>In the &quot;Super Resolution&quot; mode, images must be
read in units of two lines (3198 pixels or 9594 bytes.) If
you try to read less than two lines, you get
SANE_STATUS_INVAL. The Super Resolution mode is very
slow.</p>

<p>In the &quot;Viewfinder&quot; and &quot;Thumbnail&quot;
modes, the entire image must be read in one SCSI transfer.
In this case, the driver performs buffering and you can read
the image in as small an increment as you like.</p>
