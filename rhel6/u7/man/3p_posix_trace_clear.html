<p>POSIX_TRACE_CLEAR(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
POSIX_TRACE_CLEAR(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME posix_trace_clear - clear trace stream and trace
log (TRACING)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; #include
&lt;trace.h&gt;</p>

<p>int posix_trace_clear(trace_id_t trid);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The posix_trace_clear() function shall
reinitialize the trace stream identified by the argument
trid as if it were returning from the posix_trace_create()
function, except that the same allocated resources shall be
reused, the mapping of trace event type identifiers to trace
event names shall be unchanged, and the trace stream status
shall remain unchanged (that is, if it was running, it
remains running and if it was suspended, it remains
suspended).</p>

<p>All trace events in the trace stream recorded before the
call to posix_trace_clear() shall be lost. The
posix_stream_full_status status shall be set to
POSIX_TRACE_NOT_FULL. There is no guarantee that all trace
events that occurred during the posix_trace_clear() call are
recorded; the behavior with respect to trace points that may
occur dur- ing this call is unspecified.</p>

<p>If the Trace Log option is supported and the trace
stream has been cre- ated with a log, the
posix_trace_clear() function shall reinitialize the trace
stream with the same behavior as if the trace stream was
cre- ated without the log, plus it shall reinitialize the
trace log associ- ated with the trace stream identified by
the argument trid as if it were returning from the
posix_trace_create_withlog() function, except that the same
allocated resources, for the trace log, may be reused and
the associated trace stream status remains unchanged. The
first trace event recorded in the trace log after the call
to posix_trace_clear() shall be the same as the first trace
event recorded in the active trace stream after the call to
posix_trace_clear(). The posix_log_full_sta- tus status
shall be set to POSIX_TRACE_NOT_FULL. There is no guarantee
that all trace events that occurred during the
posix_trace_clear() call are recorded in the trace log; the
behavior with respect to trace points that may occur during
this call is unspecified. If the log full policy is
POSIX_TRACE_APPEND, the effect of a call to this function is
unspecified for the trace log associated with the trace
stream identi- fied by the trid argument.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, the
posix_trace_clear() function shall return a value of zero.
Otherwise, it shall return the corresponding error
number.</p>

<p>ERRORS The posix_trace_clear() function shall fail
if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The value of the trid argument does not
correspond to an active trace stream.</p>
