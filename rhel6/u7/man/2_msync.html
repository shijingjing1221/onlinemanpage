<p>MSYNC(2) Linux Programmer s Manual MSYNC(2)</p>

<p>NAME msync - synchronize a file with a memory map</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/mman.h&gt;</p>

<p>int msync(void *addr, size_t length, int flags);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION msync() flushes changes made to the in-core
copy of a file that was mapped into memory using mmap(2)
back to disk. Without use of this call there is no guarantee
that changes are written back before mun- map(2) is called.
To be more precise, the part of the file that corre- sponds
to the memory area starting at addr and having length length
is updated.</p>

<p>The flags argument may have the bits MS_ASYNC, MS_SYNC,
and MS_INVALI- DATE set, but not both MS_ASYNC and MS_SYNC.
MS_ASYNC specifies that an update be scheduled, but the call
returns immediately. MS_SYNC asks for an update and waits
for it to complete. MS_INVALIDATE asks to invalidate other
mappings of the same file (so that they can be updated with
the fresh values just written).</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, zero is returned. On error, -1
is returned, and errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS EBUSY MS_INVALIDATE was specified in flags, and a
memory lock exists for the specified address range.</p>

<p>EINVAL addr is not a multiple of PAGESIZE; or any bit
other than MS_ASYNC | MS_INVALIDATE | MS_SYNC is set in
flags; or both MS_SYNC and MS_ASYNC are set in flags.</p>

<p>ENOMEM The indicated memory (or part of it) was not
mapped.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>This call was introduced in Linux 1.3.21, and then used
EFAULT instead of ENOMEM. In Linux 2.4.19 this was changed
to the POSIX value ENOMEM.</p>

<p>AVAILABILITY On POSIX systems on which msync() is
available, both _POSIX_MAPPED_FILES and
_POSIX_SYNCHRONIZED_IO are defined in &lt;unistd.h&gt; to a
value greater than 0. (See also sysconf(3).)</p>
