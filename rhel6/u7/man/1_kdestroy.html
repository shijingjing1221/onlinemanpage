<p>NAME kdestroy - destroy Kerberos tickets</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS kdestroy [-A] [-q] [-c cache_name]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The kdestroy utility destroys the users
active Kerberos authorization tickets by writing zeros to
the specified credentials cache that con- tains them. If the
credentials cache is not specified, the default credentials
cache is destroyed.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -A Destroys all caches in the collection, if a
cache collection is available. -q Run quietly. Normally
kdestroy beeps if it fails to destroy the user s tickets.
The -q flag suppresses this behavior.</p>

<p>-c cache_name use cache_name as the credentials (ticket)
cache name and loca- tion; if this option is not used, the
default cache name and location are used.</p>

<p>The default credentials cache may vary between systems.
If the KRB5CCNAME environment variable is set, its value is
used to name the default ticket cache.</p>

<p>Most installations recommend that you place the kdestroy
command in your .logout file, so that your tickets are
destroyed automatically when you log out.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT Kdestroy uses the following environment
variables:</p>

<p>KRB5CCNAME Location of the default Kerberos 5
credentials (ticket) cache, in the form type:residual. If no
type prefix is present, the FILE type is assumed. The type
of the default cache may determine the availability of a
cache collection; for instance, a default cache of type DIR
causes caches within the directory to be present in the
collection.</p>

<p>FILES /tmp/krb5cc_[uid] default location of Kerberos 5
credentials cache ([uid] is the decimal UID of the
user).</p>

<p>SEE ALSO kinit(1), klist(1), krb5(3)</p>

<p>BUGS Only the tickets in the specified credentials cache
are destroyed. Separate ticket caches are used to hold root
instance and password changing tickets. These should
probably be destroyed too, or all of a users tickets kept in
a single credentials cache.</p>
