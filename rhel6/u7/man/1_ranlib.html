<p>NAME ranlib - generate index to archive.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ranlib [-vVt] archive</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION ranlib generates an index to the contents of
an archive and stores it in the archive. The index lists
each symbol defined by a member of an archive that is a
relocatable object file.</p>

<p>You may use nm -s or nm --print-armap to list this
index.</p>

<p>An archive with such an index speeds up linking to the
library and allows routines in the library to call each
other without regard to their placement in the archive.</p>

<p>The GNU ranlib program is another form of GNU ar;
running ranlib is completely equivalent to executing ar
-s.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -v -V --version Show the version number of
ranlib.</p>

<p>-t Update the timestamp of the symbol map of an
archive.</p>

<p>@file Read command-line options from file. The options
read are inserted in place of the original @file option. If
file does not exist, or cannot be read, then the option will
be treated literally, and not removed.</p>

<p>Options in file are separated by whitespace. A
whitespace character may be included in an option by
surrounding the entire option in either single or double
quotes. Any character (including a backslash) may be
included by prefixing the character to be included with a
backslash. The file may itself contain additional @file
options; any such options will be processed recursively.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO ar(1), nm(1), and the Info entries for
binutils.</p>
