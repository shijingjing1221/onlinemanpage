<p>NAME zipnote - write the comments in zipfile to stdout,
edit comments and rename files in zipfile</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS zipnote [-w] [-b path] [-h] [-v] [-L]
zipfile</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS zipfile Zipfile to read comments from or
edit.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -w Write comments to a zipfile from stdin (see
below).</p>

<p>-b path Use path for the temporary zip file.</p>

<p>-h Show a short help.</p>

<p>-v Show version information.</p>

<p>-L Show software license.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION zipnote writes the comments in a zipfile to
stdout. This is the default mode. A second mode allows
updating the comments in a zipfile as well as allows
changing the names of the files in the zipfile. These modes
are described below.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES To write all comments in a zipfile to stdout
use for example</p>

<p>zipnote foo.zip &gt; foo.tmp</p>

<p>This writes all comments in the zipfile foo.zip to the
file foo.tmp in a specific format.</p>

<p>If desired, this file can then be edited to change the
comments and then used to update the zipfile.</p>

<p>zipnote -w foo.zip &lt; foo.tmp</p>

<p>The names of the files in the zipfile can also be
changed in this way. This is done by following lines like
&quot;@ name&quot; in the created temporary file (called
foo.tmp here) with lines like &quot;@=newname&quot; and then
using the -w option as above.</p>

<p>BUGS The temporary file format is rather specific and
zipnote is rather picky about it. It should be easier to
change file names in a script.</p>

<p>Does not yet support large (&gt; 2 GB) or split
archives.</p>
