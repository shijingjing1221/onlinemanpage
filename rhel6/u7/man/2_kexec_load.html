<p>KEXEC_LOAD(2) Linux System Calls KEXEC_LOAD(2)</p>

<p>NAME kexec_load - loads a new kernel image to memory</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;syscall.h&gt; #include
&lt;kexec.h&gt;</p>

<p>long kexec_load(unsigned long entry, unsigned long
nr_segments, struct kexec_segment *segments, unsigned long
flags);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION kexec_load loads the new kernel from the
current address space. This system call can only be used by
root.</p>

<p>entry is a pointer to the entry point of newly loaded
executable image. This is the memory location where kernel
will jump to and start execut- ing instructions of newly
loaded image.</p>

<p>nr_segments denotes the number of segments which will be
passed to kexec_load. The value must not be greater than
KEXEC_SEGMENT_MAX.</p>

<p>segments denotes a pointer to the first element of an
array of kexec_segment elements. A kexec_segment element
contains the details of a segment to be loaded in
memory.</p>

<p>flags Sixteen most significant bits of the flag are used
to communicate the architecture information (KEXEC_ARCH_*).
The values for various architectures are same as defined by
ELF specifications.</p>

<p>Lower sixteen bits have been reserved for miscellaneous
information. Currently only one bit is being used and rest
fifteen have been reserved for future use.</p>

<p>The least significant bit (KEXEC_ON_CRASH) can be set to
inform the kernel that the memory memory image being loaded
is to be executed upon a system crash and not regular boot.
For regular boot, this bit is cleared.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, zero is returned. On error,
nonzero value is returned, and errno is set
appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS EPERM the calling process has not sufficient
permissions (is not root).</p>

<p>EINVAL the flags argument contains an invalid
combination of flags, or nr_segments is greater than
KEXEC_SEGMENT_MAX.</p>

<p>ENOMEM there is not enough memory to store the kernel
image.</p>

<p>EBUSY the memory location which should be written to is
not available now.</p>

<p>AVAILABILITY This syscall is implemented only since
kernel 2.6.13</p>
