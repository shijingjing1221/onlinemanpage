<p>XkbBell(3) XKB FUNCTIONS XkbBell(3)</p>

<p>NAME XkbBell - Rings the bell on the default
keyboard</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS Bool XkbBell (Display *display, Window window,
int percent, Atom name);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS - display connection to the X server</p>

<p>- window event window, or None</p>

<p>- percent relative volume, which can range from -100 to
100 inclusive</p>

<p>- name a bell name, or NULL</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The core X protocol allows only applications
to explicitly sound the system bell with a given duration,
pitch, and volume. Xkb extends this capability by allowing
clients to attach symbolic names to bells, dis- able audible
bells, and receive an event whenever the keyboard bell is
rung. For the purposes of this document, the audible bell is
defined to be the system bell, or the default keyboard bell,
as opposed to any other audible sound generated elsewhere in
the system. You can ask to receive XkbBellNotify events when
any client rings any one of the fol- lowing:</p>

<p>&middot; The default bell</p>

<p>&middot; Any bell on an input device that can be
specified by a bell_class and bell_id pair</p>

<p>&middot; Any bell specified only by an arbitrary name.
(This is, from the servers point of view, merely a name, and
not connected with any physical sound-generating device.
Some client application must generate the sound, or visual
feedback, if any, that is associated with the name.)</p>

<p>You can also ask to receive XkbBellNotify events when
the server rings the default bell or if any client has
requested events only (without the bell sounding) for any of
the bell types previously listed.</p>

<p>You can disable audible bells on a global basis. For
example, a client that replaces the keyboard bell with some
other audible cue might want to turn off the AudibleBell
control to prevent the server from also generating a sound
and avoid cacophony. If you disable audible bells and
request to receive XkbBellNotify events, you can generate
feedback different from the default bell.</p>

<p>You can, however, override the AudibleBell control by
calling one of the functions that force the ringing of a
bell in spite of the setting of the AudibleBell control -
XkbForceDeviceBell or XkbForceBell. In this case the server
does not generate a bell event.</p>

<p>Just as some keyboards can produce keyclicks to indicate
when a key is pressed or repeating, Xkb can provide feedback
for the controls by using special beep codes. The
AccessXFeedback control is used to con- figure the specific
types of operations that generate feedback.</p>

<p>Bell Names</p>

<p>You can associate a name to an act of ringing a bell by
converting the name to an Atom and then using this name when
you call the functions listed in this chapter. If an event
is generated as a result, the name is then passed to all
other clients interested in receiving XkbBellNo- tify
events. Note that these are arbitrary names and that there
is no binding to any sounds. Any sounds or other effects
(such as visual bells on the screen) must be generated by a
client application upon receipt of the bell event containing
the name. There is no default name for the default keyboard
bell. The server does generate some predefined bells for the
AccessX controls. These named bells are shown in Table 1
below; the name is included in any bell event sent to
clients that have requested to receive XkbBellNotify
events.</p>

<p>Audible Bells</p>

<p>Using Xkb you can generate bell events that do not
necessarily ring the system bell. This is useful if you need
to use an audio server instead of the system beep. For
example, when an audio client starts, it could disable the
audible bell (the system bell) and then listen for XkbBell-
Notify events. When it receives a XkbBellNotify event, the
audio client could then send a request to an audio server to
play a sound.</p>

<p>You can control the audible bells feature by passing the
XkbAudible- BellMask to XkbChangeEnabledControls. If you set
XkbAudibleBellMask on, the server rings the system bell when
a bell event occurs. This is the default. If you set
XkbAudibleBellMask off and a bell event occurs, the server
does not ring the system bell unless you call XkbForceDe-
viceBell or XkbForceBell.</p>

<p>Audible bells are also part of the per-client auto-reset
controls.</p>

<p>Bell Functions</p>

<p>Use the functions described in this section to ring
bells and to gener- ate bell events.</p>

<p>The input extension has two types of feedbacks that can
generate bells - bell feedback and keyboard feedback. Some
of the functions in this section have bell_class and bell_id
parameters; set them as follows: Set bell_class to
BellFeedbackClass or KbdFeedbackClass. A device can have
more than one feedback of each type; set bell_id to the
particular bell feedback of bell_class type.</p>

<p>Table 2 shows the conditions that cause a bell to sound
or an XkbBell- NotifyEvent to be generated when a bell
function is called.</p>

<p>Table 2 Bell Sounding and Bell Event Generating
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Function called AudibleBell Server sounds a bell Server
sends an XkbBellNotifyEvent
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
XkbDeviceBell On Yes Yes XkbDeviceBell Off No Yes XkbBell On
Yes Yes XkbBell Off No Yes XkbDeviceBellEvent On or Off No
Yes XkbBellEvent On or Off No Yes XkbDeviceForceBell On or
Off Yes No XkbForceBell On or Off Yes No</p>

<p>If a compatible keyboard extension isnt present in the X
server, XkbBell calls XBell with the specified display and
percent, and returns False. Otherwise, XkbBell calls
XkbDeviceBell with the specified dis- play, window, percent,
and name, a device_spec of XkbUseCoreKbd, a bell_class of
XkbDfltXIClass, and a bell_id of XkbDfltXIId, and returns
True.</p>

<p>If you have disabled the audible bell, the server does
not ring the system bell, although it does generate a
XkbBellNotify event.</p>

<p>You can call XkbBell without first initializing the
keyboard extension.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUES FALSE The XkbBell function returns FALSE
if XlibDisplayNoXkb is set.</p>

<p>STRUCTURES Xkb generates XkbBellNotify events for all
bells except for those resulting from calls to
XkbForceDeviceBell and XkbForceBell. To receive
XkbBellNotify events under all possible conditions, pass
XkbBellNotifyMask in both the bits_to_change and
values_for_bits param- eters to XkbSelectEvents.</p>

<p>The XkbBellNotify event has no event details. It is
either selected or it is not. However, you can call
XkbSelectEventDetails using XkbBell- Notify as the
event_type and specifying XkbAllBellNotifyMask in
bits_to_change and values_for_bits. This has the same effect
as a call to XkbSelectEvents.</p>

<p>The structure for the XkbBellNotify event type
contains:</p>

<p>typedef struct _XkbBellNotify { int type; / Xkb
extension base event code */ unsigned long serial; / X
server serial number for event */ Bool send_event; / True
=&gt; synthetically generated */ Display * display; / server
connection where event generated */ Time time; / server time
when event generated */ int xkb_type; / XkbBellNotify */
unsigned int device; / Xkb device ID, will not be
XkbUseCoreKbd */ int percent; / requested volume as % of max
*/ int pitch; / requested pitch in Hz */ int duration; /
requested duration in microseconds */ unsigned int
bell_class; / X input extension feedback class */ unsigned
int bell_id; / X input extension feedback ID */ Atom name; /
&quot;name&quot; of requested bell */ Window window; /
window associated with event */ Bool event_only; / False
-&gt; the server did not produce a beep */ }
XkbBellNotifyEvent;</p>

<p>If your application needs to generate visual bell
feedback on the screen when it receives a bell event, use
the window ID in the XkbBell- NotifyEvent, if present.</p>
