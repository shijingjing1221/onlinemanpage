<p>NAME pmdacifs - Common Internet Filesystem (CIFS)
PMDA</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pmdacifs is a Performance Metrics Domain
Agent (PMDA) which exports metric values about mounted CIFS
shares from the /proc/fs/cifs direc- tory. This PMDA
requires at least the CIFS kernel module to be loaded to
return some metric values and at least one mounted CIFS
share in order to provide data for all metrics.</p>

<p>Further details on CIFS can be found at
http://redhat.com</p>

<p>INSTALLATION Install the CIFS PMDA by using the Install
script as root:</p>

<p># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/cifs # ./Install</p>

<p>To uninstall, do the following as root:</p>

<p># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/cifs # ./Remove</p>

<p>pmdacifs is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be
executed directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify
pmcd when the agent is installed or removed.</p>

<p>FILES $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/cifs/help default help text file
for the CIFS metrics</p>

<p>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/cifs/Install installation script for the
pmdacifs agent</p>

<p>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/cifs/Remove undo installation script for
the pmdacifs agent</p>

<p>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/cifs.log default log file for error
messages from pmdacifs</p>

<p>PCP ENVIRONMENT Environment variables with the prefix
PCP_ are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP. On each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in pcp.conf(5).</p>
