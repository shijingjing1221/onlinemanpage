<p>TELNET-PROBE(1) TELNET-PROBE(1)</p>

<p>NAME telnet-probe - lightweight telnet-like port
probe</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS $PCP_BINADM_DIR/telnet-probe [-c] [-v] host
port</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION telnet-probe allows the pmdashping(1)
daemons to establish connections to arbitrary local and
remote service-providing daemons so that response time and
service availability information can be obtained.</p>

<p>The required host and port number arguments have the
same meaning as their telnet(1) equivalents.</p>

<p>The -c option causes telnet-probe to perform a
connect(2) only. This skips the read(2) and write(2)
exercise that would otherwise be done after connecting (see
below).</p>

<p>The -v option causes telnet-probe to be verbose while
operating.</p>

<p>Once the telnet connection has been established,
telnet-probe reads from stdin until end-of-file, and writes
all the input data to the tel- net connection. Next,
telnet-probe will read from the telnet connec- tion until
end-of-file, discarding whatever data it receives. Then
telnet-probe exits.</p>

<p>To operate successfully, the input passed via
telnet-probe to the remote service must be sufficient to
cause the remote service to close the connection when the
last line of input has been processed, e.g. ending with quit
when probing SMTP on port 25.</p>

<p>By default telnet-probe will not produce any output,
unless there is an error in which case a diagnostic message
can be displayed (in verbose mode only) and the exit status
will be non-zero indicating a failure.</p>

<p>PCP ENVIRONMENT Environment variables with the prefix
PCP_ are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP. On each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in pcp.conf(5).</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS If telnet-probe succeeds, then 0 will be
returned. If the attempt to establish a connection fails or
is terminated, then a non-zero exit status is returned.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO PCPintro(1), pmdashping(1), pmie(1), telnet(1),
connect(2), read(2) and write(2).</p>
