<p>NAME c2ph, pstruct - Dump C structures as generated from
&quot;cc -g -S&quot; stabs</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS c2ph [-dpnP] [var=val] [files ...]</p>

<p>OPTIONS Options:</p>

<p>-w wide; short for: type_width=45 member_width=35
offset_width=8 -x hex; short for: offset_fmt=x
offset_width=08 size_fmt=x size_width=04</p>

<p>-n do not generate perl code (default when invoked as
pstruct) -p generate perl code (default when invoked as
c2ph) -v generate perl code, with C decls as comments</p>

<p>-i do NOT recompute sizes for intrinsic datatypes -a
dump information on intrinsics also</p>

<p>-t trace execution -d spew reams of debugging output</p>

<p>-slist give comma-separated list a structures to
dump</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The following is the old c2ph.doc
documentation by Tom Christiansen &lt;tchrist@perl.com&gt;
Date: 25 Jul 91 08:10:21 GMT</p>

<p>Once upon a time, I wrote a program called pstruct. It
was a perl program that tried to parse out C structures and
display their member offsets for you. This was especially
useful for people looking at binary dumps or poking around
the kernel.</p>

<p>Pstruct was not a pretty program. Neither was it
particularly robust. The problem, you see, was that the C
compiler was much better at parsing C than I could ever hope
to be.</p>

<p>So I got smart: I decided to be lazy and let the C
compiler parse the C, which would spit out debugger stabs
for me to read. These were much easier to parse. Its still
not a pretty program, but at least its more robust.</p>

<p>Pstruct takes any .c or .h files, or preferably .s ones,
since thats the format it is going to massage them into
anyway, and spits out listings like this:</p>

<p>struct tty { int tty.t_locker 000 4 int
tty.t_mutex_index 004 4 struct tty * tty.t_tp_virt 008 4
struct clist tty.t_rawq 00c 20 int tty.t_rawq.c_cc 00c 4 int
tty.t_rawq.c_cmax 010 4 int tty.t_rawq.c_cfx 014 4 int
tty.t_rawq.c_clx 018 4 struct tty * tty.t_rawq.c_tp_cpu 01c
4 struct tty * tty.t_rawq.c_tp_iop 020 4 unsigned char *
tty.t_rawq.c_buf_cpu 024 4 unsigned char *
tty.t_rawq.c_buf_iop 028 4 struct clist tty.t_canq 02c 20
int tty.t_canq.c_cc 02c 4 int tty.t_canq.c_cmax 030 4 int
tty.t_canq.c_cfx 034 4 int tty.t_canq.c_clx 038 4 struct tty
* tty.t_canq.c_tp_cpu 03c 4 struct tty * tty.t_canq.c_tp_iop
040 4 unsigned char * tty.t_canq.c_buf_cpu 044 4 unsigned
char * tty.t_canq.c_buf_iop 048 4 struct clist tty.t_outq
04c 20 int tty.t_outq.c_cc 04c 4 int tty.t_outq.c_cmax 050 4
int tty.t_outq.c_cfx 054 4 int tty.t_outq.c_clx 058 4 struct
tty * tty.t_outq.c_tp_cpu 05c 4 struct tty *
tty.t_outq.c_tp_iop 060 4 unsigned char *
tty.t_outq.c_buf_cpu 064 4 unsigned char *
tty.t_outq.c_buf_iop 068 4 (*int)() tty.t_oproc_cpu 06c 4
(*int)() tty.t_oproc_iop 070 4 (*int)() tty.t_stopproc_cpu
074 4 (*int)() tty.t_stopproc_iop 078 4 struct thread *
tty.t_rsel 07c 4</p>

<p>etc.</p>

<p>Actually, this was generated by a particular set of
options. You can control the formatting of each column,
whether you prefer wide or fat, hex or decimal, leading
zeroes or whatever.</p>

<p>All you need to be able to use this is a C compiler than
generates BSD/GCC-style stabs. The -g option on native BSD
compilers and GCC should get this for you.</p>

<p>To learn more, just type a bogus option, like - message
will be provided. There are a fair number of
possibilities.</p>

<p>If youre only a C programmer, than this is the end of
the message for you. You can quit right now, and if you care
to, save off the source and run it when you feel like it. Or
not.</p>

<p>But if youre a perl programmer, then for you I have
something much more wondrous than just a structure offset
printer.</p>

<p>You see, if you call pstruct by its other incybernation,
c2ph, you have a code generator that translates C code into
perl code! Well, structure and union declarations at least,
but thats quite a bit.</p>

<p>Prior to this point, anyone programming in perl who
wanted to interact with C programs, like the kernel, was
forced to guess the layouts of the C structures, and then
hardwire these into his program. Of course, when you took
your wonderfully crafted program to a system where the sgtty
structure was laid out differently, your program broke.
Which is a shame.</p>

<p>We ve had Larrys h2ph translator, which helped, but that
only works on cpp symbols, not real C, which was also very
much needed. What I offer you is a symbolic way of getting
at all the C structures. Ive couched them in terms of
packages and functions. Consider the following program:</p>

<p>#!/usr/local/bin/perl</p>

<p>require &rsquo;syscall.ph&rsquo;; require
&rsquo;sys/time.ph&rsquo;; require
&rsquo;sys/resource.ph&rsquo;;</p>

<p>$ru = &quot; &quot; x &amp;rusage&rsquo;sizeof();</p>

<p>syscall(&amp;SYS_getrusage, &amp;RUSAGE_SELF, $ru)
&amp;&amp; die &quot;getrusage: $!&quot;;</p>

<p>@ru = unpack($t = &amp;rusage&rsquo;typedef(), $ru);</p>

<p>$utime = $ru[ &amp;rusage&rsquo;ru_utime +
&amp;timeval&rsquo;tv_sec ] + ($ru[
&amp;rusage&rsquo;ru_utime + &amp;timeval&rsquo;tv_usec ]) /
1e6;</p>

<p>$stime = $ru[ &amp;rusage&rsquo;ru_stime +
&amp;timeval&rsquo;tv_sec ] + ($ru[
&amp;rusage&rsquo;ru_stime + &amp;timeval&rsquo;tv_usec ]) /
1e6;</p>

<p>printf &quot;you have used %8.3fs+%8.3fu seconds.0,
$utime, $stime;</p>

<p>As you see, the name of the package is the name of the
structure. Regular fields are just their own names. Plus the
following accessor functions are provided for your
convenience:</p>

<p>struct This takes no arguments, and is merely the number
of first-level elements in the structure. You would use this
for indexing into arrays of structures, perhaps like
this</p>

<p>$usec = $u[ &amp;user&rsquo;u_utimer +
(&amp;ITIMER_VIRTUAL * &amp;itimerval&rsquo;struct) +
&amp;itimerval&rsquo;it_value + &amp;timeval&rsquo;tv_usec
];</p>

<p>sizeof Returns the bytes in the structure, or the member
if you pass it an argument, such as</p>


<p>&amp;rusage&rsquo;sizeof(&amp;rusage&rsquo;ru_utime)</p>

<p>typedef This is the perl format definition for passing
to pack and unpack. If you ask for the typedef of a nothing,
you get the whole structure, otherwise you get that of the
member you ask for. Padding is taken care of, as is the
magic to guarantee that a union is unpacked into all its
aliases. Bitfields are not quite yet supported however.</p>

<p>offsetof This function is the byte offset into the array
of that member. You may wish to use this for indexing
directly into the packed structure with vec() if
you&rsquo;re too lazy to unpack it.</p>

<p>typeof Not to be confused with the typedef accessor
function, this one returns the C type of that field. This
would allow you to print out a nice structured pretty print
of some structure without knoning anything about it
beforehand. No args to this one is a noop. Someday
I&rsquo;ll post such a thing to dump out your u structure
for you.</p>

<p>The way I see this being used is like basically
this:</p>

<p>% h2ph &lt;some_include_file.h &gt; /usr/lib/perl/tmp.ph
% c2ph some_include_file.h &gt;&gt; /usr/lib/perl/tmp.ph %
install</p>

<p>Its a little tricker with c2ph because you have to get
the includes right. I cant know this for your system, but it
s not usually too terribly difficult.</p>

<p>The code isnt pretty as I mentioned -- I never thought
it would be a 1000- line program when I started, or I might
not have begun. :-) But I would have been less cavalier in
how the parts of the program communicated with each other,
etc. It might also have helped if I didn t have to divine
the makeup of the stabs on the fly, and then account for
micro differences between my compiler and gcc.</p>

<p>Anyway, here it is. Should run on perl v4 or greater.
Maybe less.</p>
