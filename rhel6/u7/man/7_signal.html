<p>SIGNAL(7) Linux Programmer s Manual SIGNAL(7)</p>

<p>NAME signal - overview of signals</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Linux supports both POSIX reliable signals
(hereinafter &quot;standard sig- nals&quot;) and POSIX
real-time signals.</p>

<p>Signal Dispositions Each signal has a current
disposition, which determines how the process behaves when
it is delivered the signal.</p>

<p>The entries in the &quot;Action&quot; column of the
tables below specify the default disposition for each
signal, as follows:</p>

<p>Term Default action is to terminate the process.</p>

<p>Ign Default action is to ignore the signal.</p>

<p>Core Default action is to terminate the process and dump
core (see core(5)).</p>

<p>Stop Default action is to stop the process.</p>

<p>Cont Default action is to continue the process if it is
currently stopped.</p>

<p>A process can change the disposition of a signal using
sigaction(2) or (less portably) signal(2). Using these
system calls, a process can elect one of the following
behaviors to occur on delivery of the sig- nal: perform the
default action; ignore the signal; or catch the signal with
a signal handler, a programmer-defined function that is
automati- cally invoked when the signal is delivered. (By
default, the signal handler is invoked on the normal process
stack. It is possible to arrange that the signal handler
uses an alternate stack; see sigalt- stack(2) for a
discussion of how to do this and when it might be use-
ful.)</p>

<p>The signal disposition is a per-process attribute: in a
multithreaded application, the disposition of a particular
signal is the same for all threads.</p>

<p>A child created via fork(2) inherits a copy of its
parents signal dis- positions. During an execve(2), the
dispositions of handled signals are reset to the default;
the dispositions of ignored signals are left unchanged.</p>

<p>Sending a Signal The following system calls and library
functions allow the caller to send a signal:</p>

<p>raise(3) Sends a signal to the calling thread.</p>

<p>kill(2) Sends a signal to a specified process, to all
members of a specified process group, or to all processes on
the system.</p>

<p>killpg(2) Sends a signal to all of the members of a
specified process group.</p>

<p>pthread_kill(3) Sends a signal to a specified POSIX
thread in the same process as the caller.</p>

<p>tgkill(2) Sends a signal to a specified thread within a
specific process. (This is the system call used to implement
pthread_kill(3).)</p>

<p>sigqueue(2) Sends a real-time signal with accompanying
data to a specified process.</p>

<p>Waiting for a Signal to be Caught The following system
calls suspend execution of the calling process or thread
until a signal is caught (or an unhandled signal terminates
the process):</p>

<p>pause(2) Suspends execution until any signal is
caught.</p>

<p>sigsuspend(2) Temporarily changes the signal mask (see
below) and suspends execution until one of the unmasked
signals is caught.</p>

<p>Synchronously Accepting a Signal Rather than
asynchronously catching a signal via a signal handler, it is
possible to synchronously accept the signal, that is, to
block exe- cution until the signal is delivered, at which
point the kernel returns information about the signal to the
caller. There are two general ways to do this:</p>

<p>* sigwaitinfo(2), sigtimedwait(2), and sigwait(3)
suspend execution until one of the signals in a specified
set is delivered. Each of these calls returns information
about the delivered signal.</p>

<p>* signalfd(2) returns a file descriptor that can be used
to read infor- mation about signals that are delivered to
the caller. Each read(2) from this file descriptor blocks
until one of the signals in the set specified in the
signalfd(2) call is delivered to the caller. The buffer
returned by read(2) contains a structure describing the sig-
nal.</p>

<p>Signal Mask and Pending Signals A signal may be blocked,
which means that it will not be delivered until it is later
unblocked. Between the time when it is generated and when it
is delivered a signal is said to be pending.</p>

<p>Each thread in a process has an independent signal mask,
which indi- cates the set of signals that the thread is
currently blocking. A thread can manipulate its signal mask
using pthread_sigmask(3). In a traditional single-threaded
application, sigprocmask(2) can be used to manipulate the
signal mask.</p>

<p>A child created via fork(2) inherits a copy of its
parents signal mask; the signal mask is preserved across
execve(2).</p>

<p>A signal may be generated (and thus pending) for a
process as a whole (e.g., when sent using kill(2)) or for a
specific thread (e.g., certain signals, such as SIGSEGV and
SIGFPE, generated as a consequence of exe- cuting a specific
machine-language instruction are thread directed, as are
signals targeted at a specific thread using
pthread_kill(3)). A process-directed signal may be delivered
to any one of the threads that does not currently have the
signal blocked. If more than one of the threads has the
signal unblocked, then the kernel chooses an arbitrary
thread to which to deliver the signal.</p>

<p>A thread can obtain the set of signals that it currently
has pending using sigpending(2). This set will consist of
the union of the set of pending process-directed signals and
the set of signals pending for the calling thread.</p>

<p>A child created via fork(2) initially has an empty
pending signal set; the pending signal set is preserved
across an execve(2).</p>

<p>Standard Signals Linux supports the standard signals
listed below. Several signal num- bers are
architecture-dependent, as indicated in the
&quot;Value&quot; column. (Where three values are given, the
first one is usually valid for alpha and sparc, the middle
one for ix86, ia64, ppc, s390, arm and sh, and the last one
for mips. A - denotes that a signal is absent on the cor-
responding architecture.)</p>

<p>First the signals described in the original POSIX.1-1990
standard.</p>

<p>Signal Value Action Comment
----------------------------------------------------------------------
SIGHUP 1 Term Hangup detected on controlling terminal or
death of controlling process SIGINT 2 Term Interrupt from
keyboard SIGQUIT 3 Core Quit from keyboard SIGILL 4 Core
Illegal Instruction SIGABRT 6 Core Abort signal from
abort(3) SIGFPE 8 Core Floating point exception SIGKILL 9

<p>The signals SIGKILL and SIGSTOP cannot be caught,
blocked, or ignored.</p>

<p>Next the signals not in the POSIX.1-1990 standard but
described in SUSv2 and POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>Signal Value Action Comment
--------------------------------------------------------------------
SIGBUS 10,7,10 Core Bus error (bad memory access) SIGPOLL
Term Pollable event (Sys V). Synonym for SIGIO SIGPROF
27,27,29 Term Profiling timer expired SIGSYS 12,-,12 Core
Bad argument to routine (SVr4) SIGTRAP 5 Core
Trace/breakpoint trap SIGURG 16,23,21 Ign Urgent condition
on socket (4.2BSD) SIGVTALRM 26,26,28 Term Virtual alarm
clock (4.2BSD) SIGXCPU 24,24,30 Core CPU time limit exceeded
(4.2BSD) SIGXFSZ 25,25,31 Core File size limit exceeded
(4.2BSD)</p>

<p>Up to and including Linux 2.2, the default behavior for
SIGSYS, SIGX- CPU, SIGXFSZ, and (on architectures other than
SPARC and MIPS) SIGBUS was to terminate the process (without
a core dump). (On some other Unix systems the default action
for SIGXCPU and SIGXFSZ is to terminate the process without
a core dump.) Linux 2.4 conforms to the POSIX.1-2001
requirements for these signals, terminating the process with
a core dump.</p>

<p>Next various other signals.</p>

<p>Signal Value Action Comment</p>


<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------
SIGIOT 6 Core IOT trap. A synonym for SIGABRT SIGEMT 7,-,7
Term SIGSTKFLT -,16,- Term Stack fault on coprocessor
(unused) SIGIO 23,29,22 Term I/O now possible (4.2BSD)
SIGCLD -,-,18 Ign A synonym for SIGCHLD SIGPWR 29,30,19 Term
Power failure (System V) SIGINFO 29,-,- A synonym for SIGPWR
SIGLOST -,-,- Term File lock lost SIGWINCH 28,28,20 Ign
Window resize signal (4.3BSD, Sun) SIGUNUSED -,31,- Term
Unused signal (will be SIGSYS)</p>

<p>(Signal 29 is SIGINFO / SIGPWR on an alpha but SIGLOST
on a sparc.)</p>

<p>SIGEMT is not specified in POSIX.1-2001, but
nevertheless appears on most other Unix systems, where its
default action is typically to ter- minate the process with
a core dump.</p>

<p>SIGPWR (which is not specified in POSIX.1-2001) is
typically ignored by default on those other Unix systems
where it appears.</p>

<p>SIGIO (which is not specified in POSIX.1-2001) is
ignored by default on several other Unix systems.</p>

<p>Real-time Signals Linux supports real-time signals as
originally defined in the POSIX.1b real-time extensions (and
now included in POSIX.1-2001). The range of supported
real-time signals is defined by the macros SIGRTMIN and
SIGRTMAX. POSIX.1-2001 requires that an implementation
support at least _POSIX_RTSIG_MAX (8) real-time signals.</p>

<p>The Linux kernel supports a range of 32 different
real-time signals, numbered 33 to 64. However, the glibc
POSIX threads implementation internally uses two (for NPTL)
or three (for LinuxThreads) real-time signals (see
pthreads(7)), and adjusts the value of SIGRTMIN suitably (to
34 or 35). Because the range of available real-time signals
varies according to the glibc threading implementation (and
this variation can occur at run time according to the
available kernel and glibc), and indeed the range of
real-time signals varies across Unix systems, pro- grams
should never refer to real-time signals using hard-coded
numbers, but instead should always refer to real-time
signals using the notation SIGRTMIN+n, and include suitable
(run-time) checks that SIGRTMIN+n does not exceed
SIGRTMAX.</p>

<p>Unlike standard signals, real-time signals have no
predefined meanings: the entire set of real-time signals can
be used for application-defined purposes. (Note, however,
that the LinuxThreads implementation uses the first three
real-time signals.)</p>

<p>The default action for an unhandled real-time signal is
to terminate the receiving process.</p>

<p>Real-time signals are distinguished by the
following:</p>

<p>1. Multiple instances of real-time signals can be
queued. By con- trast, if multiple instances of a standard
signal are delivered while that signal is currently blocked,
then only one instance is queued.</p>

<p>2. If the signal is sent using sigqueue(2), an
accompanying value (either an integer or a pointer) can be
sent with the signal. If the receiving process establishes a
handler for this signal using the SA_SIGINFO flag to
sigaction(2) then it can obtain this data via the si_value
field of the siginfo_t structure passed as the second
argument to the handler. Furthermore, the si_pid and si_uid
fields of this structure can be used to obtain the PID and
real user ID of the process sending the signal.</p>

<p>3. Real-time signals are delivered in a guaranteed
order. Multiple real-time signals of the same type are
delivered in the order they were sent. If different
real-time signals are sent to a process, they are delivered
starting with the lowest-numbered signal. (I.e.,
low-numbered signals have highest priority.) By contrast, if
multiple standard signals are pending for a process, the
order in which they are delivered is unspecified.</p>

<p>If both standard and real-time signals are pending for a
process, POSIX leaves it unspecified which is delivered
first. Linux, like many other implementations, gives
priority to standard signals in this case.</p>

<p>According to POSIX, an implementation should permit at
least _POSIX_SIGQUEUE_MAX (32) real-time signals to be
queued to a process. However, Linux does things differently.
In kernels up to and including 2.6.7, Linux imposes a
system-wide limit on the number of queued real- time signals
for all processes. This limit can be viewed and (with
privilege) changed via the /proc/sys/kernel/rtsig-max file.
A related file, /proc/sys/kernel/rtsig-nr, can be used to
find out how many real- time signals are currently queued.
In Linux 2.6.8, these /proc inter- faces were replaced by
the RLIMIT_SIGPENDING resource limit, which specifies a
per-user limit for queued signals; see setrlimit(2) for
further details.</p>

<p>Async-signal-safe functions A signal handling routine
established by sigaction(2) or signal(2) must be very
careful, since processing elsewhere may be interrupted at
some arbitrary point in the execution of the program. POSIX
has the concept of &quot;safe function&quot;. If a signal
interrupts the execution of an unsafe function, and handler
calls an unsafe function, then the behavior of the program
is undefined.</p>

<p>POSIX.1-2004 (also known as POSIX.1-2001 Technical
Corrigendum 2) requires an implementation to guarantee that
the following functions can be safely called inside a signal
handler:</p>

<p>_Exit() _exit() abort() accept() access() aio_error()
aio_return() aio_suspend() alarm() bind() cfgetispeed()
cfgetospeed() cfsetispeed() cfsetospeed() chdir() chmod()
chown() clock_gettime() close() connect() creat() dup()
dup2() execle() execve() fchmod() fchown() fcntl()
fdatasync() fork() fpathconf() fstat() fsync() ftruncate()
getegid() geteuid() getgid() getgroups() getpeername()
getpgrp() getpid() getppid() getsockname() getsockopt()
getuid() kill() link() listen() lseek() lstat() mkdir()
mkfifo() open() pathconf() pause() pipe() poll()
posix_trace_event() pselect() raise() read() readlink()
recv() recvfrom() recvmsg() rename() rmdir() select()
sem_post() send() sendmsg() sendto() setgid() setpgid()
setsid() setsockopt() setuid() shutdown() sigaction()
sigaddset() sigdelset() sigemptyset() sigfillset()
sigismember() signal() sigpause() sigpending() sigprocmask()
sigqueue() sigset() sigsuspend() sleep() sockatmark()
socket() socketpair() stat() symlink() sysconf() tcdrain()
tcflow() tcflush() tcgetattr() tcgetpgrp() tcsendbreak()
tcsetattr() tcsetpgrp() time() timer_getoverrun()
timer_gettime() timer_settime() times() umask() uname()
unlink() utime() wait() waitpid() write()</p>

<p>POSIX.1-2008 removes fpathconf(), pathconf(), and
sysconf() from the above list, and adds the following
functions:</p>

<p>execl() execv() faccessat() fchmodat() fchownat()
fexecve() fstatat() futimens() linkat() mkdirat() mkfifoat()
mknod() mknodat() openat() readlinkat() renameat()
symlinkat() unlinkat() utimensat() utimes()</p>

<p>Interruption of System Calls and Library Functions by
Signal Handlers If a signal handler is invoked while a
system call or library function call is blocked, then
either:</p>

<p>* the call is automatically restarted after the signal
handler returns; or</p>

<p>* the call fails with the error EINTR.</p>

<p>Which of these two behaviors occurs depends on the
interface and whether or not the signal handler was
established using the SA_RESTART flag (see sigaction(2)).
The details vary across Unix systems; below, the details for
Linux.</p>

<p>If a blocked call to one of the following interfaces is
interrupted by a signal handler, then the call will be
automatically restarted after the signal handler returns if
the SA_RESTART flag was used; otherwise the call will fail
with the error EINTR:</p>

<p>* read(2), readv(2), write(2), writev(2), and ioctl(2)
calls on &quot;slow&quot; devices. A &quot;slow&quot; device
is one where the I/O call may block for an indefinite time,
for example, a terminal, pipe, or socket. (A disk is not a
slow device according to this defini- tion.) If an I/O call
on a slow device has already transferred some data by the
time it is interrupted by a signal handler, then the call
will return a success status (normally, the number of bytes
transferred).</p>

<p>* open(2), if it can block (e.g., when opening a FIFO;
see fifo(7)).</p>

<p>* wait(2), wait3(2), wait4(2), waitid(2), and
waitpid(2).</p>

<p>* Socket interfaces: accept(2), connect(2), recv(2),
recvfrom(2), recvmsg(2), send(2), sendto(2), and sendmsg(2),
unless a timeout has been set on the socket (see below).</p>

<p>* File locking interfaces: flock(2) and fcntl(2)
F_SETLKW.</p>

<p>* POSIX message queue interfaces: mq_receive(3),
mq_time- dreceive(3), mq_send(3), and mq_timedsend(3).</p>

<p>* futex(2) FUTEX_WAIT (since Linux 2.6.22; beforehand,
always failed with EINTR).</p>

<p>* POSIX semaphore interfaces: sem_wait(3) and
sem_timedwait(3) (since Linux 2.6.22; beforehand, always
failed with EINTR).</p>

<p>The following interfaces are never restarted after being
interrupted by a signal handler, regardless of the use of
SA_RESTART; they always fail with the error EINTR when
interrupted by a signal handler:</p>

<p>* Socket interfaces, when a timeout has been set on the
socket using setsockopt(2): accept(2), recv(2), recvfrom(2),
and recvmsg(2), if a receive timeout (SO_RCVTIMEO) has been
set; con- nect(2), send(2), sendto(2), and sendmsg(2), if a
send timeout (SO_SNDTIMEO) has been set.</p>

<p>* Interfaces used to wait for signals: pause(2),
sigsuspend(2), sigtimedwait(2), and sigwaitinfo(2).</p>

<p>* File descriptor multiplexing interfaces:
epoll_wait(2), epoll_pwait(2), poll(2), ppoll(2), select(2),
and pselect(2).</p>

<p>* System V IPC interfaces: msgrcv(2), msgsnd(2),
semop(2), and sem- timedop(2).</p>

<p>* Sleep interfaces: clock_nanosleep(2), nanosleep(2),
and usleep(3).</p>

<p>* read(2) from an inotify(7) file descriptor.</p>

<p>* io_getevents(2).</p>

<p>The sleep(3) function is also never restarted if
interrupted by a han- dler, but gives a success return: the
number of seconds remaining to sleep.</p>

<p>Interruption of System Calls and Library Functions by
Stop Signals On Linux, even in the absence of signal
handlers, certain blocking interfaces can fail with the
error EINTR after the process is stopped by one of the stop
signals and then resumed via SIGCONT. This behavior is not
sanctioned by POSIX.1, and doesnt occur on other
systems.</p>

<p>The Linux interfaces that display this behavior are:</p>

<p>* Socket interfaces, when a timeout has been set on the
socket using setsockopt(2): accept(2), recv(2), recvfrom(2),
and recvmsg(2), if a receive timeout (SO_RCVTIMEO) has been
set; con- nect(2), send(2), sendto(2), and sendmsg(2), if a
send timeout (SO_SNDTIMEO) has been set.</p>

<p>* epoll_wait(2), epoll_pwait(2).</p>

<p>* semop(2), semtimedop(2).</p>

<p>* sigtimedwait(2), sigwaitinfo(2).</p>

<p>* read(2) from an inotify(7) file descriptor.</p>

<p>* Linux 2.6.21 and earlier: futex(2) FUTEX_WAIT,
sem_timedwait(3), sem_wait(3).</p>

<p>* Linux 2.6.8 and earlier: msgrcv(2), msgsnd(2).</p>

<p>* Linux 2.4 and earlier: nanosleep(2).</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO POSIX.1, except as noted.</p>

<p>BUGS SIGIO and SIGLOST have the same value. The latter
is commented out in the kernel source, but the build process
of some software still thinks that signal 29 is SIGLOST.</p>
