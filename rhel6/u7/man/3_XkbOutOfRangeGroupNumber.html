<p>XkbOutOfRangeGroupNumber(3) XKB FUNCTIONS
XkbOutOfRangeGroupNumber(3)</p>

<p>NAME XkbOutOfRangeGroupNumber - Returns the out-of-range
group number, rep- resented as a group index, from the
group_info field of an XkbSymMapRec structure</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS unsigned char XkbOutOfRangeGroupNumber
(unsigned char grp_inf);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS - grp_inf Xkb description of interest</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION XkbOutOfRangeGroupNumber returns the
out-of-range group number, repre- sented as a group index,
from the group_info field of an XkbSymMapRec structure.</p>

<p>The group_info field of an XkbSymMapRec is an encoded
value containing the number of groups of symbols bound to
the key as well as the speci- fication of the treatment of
out-of-range groups. It is legal for a key to have zero
groups, in which case it also has zero symbols and all
events from that key yield NoSymbol. To obtain the number of
groups of symbols bound to the key, use XkbKeyNumGroups. To
change the number of groups bound to a key, use
XkbChangeTypesOfKey. To obtain a mask that determines the
treatment of out-of-range groups, use XkbKeyGroupInfo and
XkbOutOfRangeGroupInfo.</p>

<p>The keyboard controls contain a groups_wrap field
specifying the han- dling of illegal groups on a global
basis. That is, when the user per- forms an action causing
the effective group to go out of the legal range, the
groups_wrap field specifies how to normalize the effective
keyboard group to a group that is legal for the keyboard as
a whole, but there is no guarantee that the normalized group
will be within the range of legal groups for any individual
key. The per-key group_info field specifies how a key treats
a legal effective group if the key does not have a type
specified for the group of concern. For example, the Enter
key usually has just one group defined. If the user performs
an action causing the global keyboard group to change to
Group2, the group_info field for the Enter key describes how
to handle this situa- tion.</p>

<p>Out-of-range groups for individual keys are mapped to a
legal group using the same options as are used for the
overall keyboard group. The particular type of mapping used
is controlled by the bits set in the group_info flag, as
shown in Table 1.</p>
