PART_ROUND_STATS(9)</p>

<p>NAME part_round_stats - Round off the performance stats
on a struct disk_stats.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS void part_round_stats(int cpu, struct hd_struct
* part);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS cpu cpu number for stats access</p>

<p>part target partition</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The average IO queue length and utilisation
statistics are maintained by observing the current state of
the queue length and the amount of time it has been in this
state for.</p>

<p>Normally, that accounting is done on IO completion, but
that can result in more than a second&acute;s worth of IO
being accounted for within any one second, leading to
&gt;100% utilisation. To deal with that, we call this
function to do a round-off before returning the results when
reading /proc/diskstats. This accounts immediately for all
queue usage up to the current jiffies and restarts the
counters again.</p>
