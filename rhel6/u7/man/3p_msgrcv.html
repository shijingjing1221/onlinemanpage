<p>MSGRCV(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual MSGRCV(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME msgrcv - XSI message receive operation</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/msg.h&gt;</p>

<p>ssize_t msgrcv(int msqid, void *msgp, size_t msgsz, long
msgtyp, int msgflg);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The msgrcv() function operates on XSI
message queues (see the Base Def- initions volume of IEEE
Std 1003.1-2001, Section 3.224, Message Queue). It is
unspecified whether this function interoperates with the
realtime interprocess communication facilities defined in
Realtime .</p>

<p>The msgrcv() function shall read a message from the
queue associated with the message queue identifier specified
by msqid and place it in the user-defined buffer pointed to
by msgp.</p>

<p>The application shall ensure that the argument msgp
points to a user- defined buffer that contains first a field
of type long specifying the type of the message, and then a
data portion that holds the data bytes of the message. The
structure below is an example of what this user- defined
buffer might look like:</p>

<p>struct mymsg { long mtype; /* Message type. */ char
mtext[1]; /* Message text. */ }</p>

<p>The structure member mtype is the received messages type
as specified by the sending process.</p>

<p>The structure member mtext is the text of the
message.</p>

<p>The argument msgsz specifies the size in bytes of mtext.
The received message shall be truncated to msgsz bytes if it
is larger than msgsz and (msgflg &amp; MSG_NOERROR) is
non-zero. The truncated part of the mes- sage shall be lost
and no indication of the truncation shall be given to the
calling process.</p>

<p>If the value of msgsz is greater than {SSIZE_MAX}, the
result is imple- mentation-defined.</p>

<p>The argument msgtyp specifies the type of message
requested as follows:</p>

<p>* If msgtyp is 0, the first message on the queue shall
be received.</p>

<p>* If msgtyp is greater than 0, the first message of type
msgtyp shall be received.</p>

<p>* If msgtyp is less than 0, the first message of the
lowest type that is less than or equal to the absolute value
of msgtyp shall be received.</p>

<p>The argument msgflg specifies the action to be taken if
a message of the desired type is not on the queue. These are
as follows:</p>

<p>* If (msgflg &amp; IPC_NOWAIT) is non-zero, the calling
thread shall return immediately with a return value of -1
and errno set to [ENOMSG].</p>

<p>* If (msgflg &amp; IPC_NOWAIT) is 0, the calling thread
shall suspend exe- cution until one of the following
occurs:</p>

<p>* A message of the desired type is placed on the
queue.</p>

<p>* The message queue identifier msqid is removed from the
system; when this occurs, errno shall be set equal to
[EIDRM] and -1 shall be returned.</p>

<p>* The calling thread receives a signal that is to be
caught; in this case a message is not received and the
calling thread resumes execution in the manner prescribed in
sigaction().</p>

<p>Upon successful completion, the following actions are
taken with respect to the data structure associated with
msqid:</p>

<p>* msg_qnum shall be decremented by 1.</p>

<p>* msg_lrpid shall be set equal to the process ID of the
calling pro- cess.</p>

<p>* msg_rtime shall be set equal to the current time.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, msgrcv() shall
return a value equal to the number of bytes actually placed
into the buffer mtext. Otherwise, no message shall be
received, msgrcv() shall return (ssize_t)-1, and errno shall
be set to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The msgrcv() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>E2BIG The value of mtext is greater than msgsz and
(msgflg &amp; MSG_NOER- ROR) is 0.</p>

<p>EACCES Operation permission is denied to the calling
process; see XSI Interprocess Communication .</p>

<p>EIDRM The message queue identifier msqid is removed from
the system.</p>

<p>EINTR The msgrcv() function was interrupted by a
signal.</p>

<p>EINVAL msqid is not a valid message queue
identifier.</p>

<p>ENOMSG The queue does not contain a message of the
desired type and (msgflg &amp; IPC_NOWAIT) is non-zero.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Receiving a Message The following example
receives the first message on the queue (based on the value
of the msgtyp argument, 0). The queue is identified by the
msqid argument (assuming that the value has previously been
set). This call specifies that an error should be reported
if no message is avail- able, but not if the message is too
large. The message size is calcu- lated directly using the
sizeof operator.</p>

<p>#include &lt;sys/msg.h&gt; ... int result; int msqid;
struct message { long type; char text[20]; } msg; long
msgtyp = 0; ... result = msgrcv(msqid, (void *) &amp;msg,
sizeof(msg.text), msgtyp, MSG_NOERROR | IPC_NOWAIT);</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The POSIX Realtime Extension defines
alternative interfaces for inter- process communication
(IPC). Application developers who need to use IPC should
design their applications so that modules using the IPC
routines described in XSI Interprocess Communication can be
easily modified to use the alternative interfaces.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
