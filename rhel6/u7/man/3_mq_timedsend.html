<p>NAME mq_send, mq_timedsend - send a message to a message
queue</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;mqueue.h&gt;</p>

<p>mqd_t mq_send(mqd_t mqdes, const char *msg_ptr, size_t
msg_len, unsigned msg_prio);</p>

<p>#define _XOPEN_SOURCE 600 #include &lt;time.h&gt;
#include &lt;mqueue.h&gt;</p>

<p>mqd_t mq_timedsend(mqd_t mqdes, const char *msg_ptr,
size_t msg_len, unsigned msg_prio, const struct timespec
*abs_timeout);</p>

<p>Link with -lrt.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION mq_send() adds the message pointed to by
msg_ptr to the message queue referred to by the descriptor
mqdes. The msg_len argument specifies the length of the
message pointed to by msg_ptr; this length must be less than
or equal to the queues mq_msgsize attribute. Zero-length
messages are allowed.</p>

<p>The msg_prio argument is a non-negative integer that
specifies the pri- ority of this message. Messages are
placed on the queue in decreasing order of priority, with
newer messages of the same priority being placed after older
messages with the same priority.</p>

<p>If the message queue is already full (i.e., the number
of messages on the queue equals the queues mq_maxmsg
attribute), then, by default, mq_send() blocks until
sufficient space becomes available to allow the message to
be queued, or until the call is interrupted by a signal han-
dler. If the O_NONBLOCK flag is enabled for the message
queue descrip- tion, then the call instead fails immediately
with the error EAGAIN.</p>

<p>mq_timedsend() behaves just like mq_send(), except that
if the queue is full and the O_NONBLOCK flag is not enabled
for the message queue description, then abs_timeout points
to a structure which specifies a ceiling on the time for
which the call will block. This ceiling is an absolute
timeout in seconds and nanoseconds since the Epoch (midnight
on the morning of 1 January 1970), specified in the
following struc- ture:</p>

<p>struct timespec { time_t tv_sec; /* seconds */ long
tv_nsec; /* nanoseconds */ };</p>

<p>If the message queue is full, and the timeout has
already expired by the time of the call, mq_timedsend()
returns immediately.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, mq_send() and mq_timedsend()
return zero; on error, -1 is returned, with errno set to
indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS EAGAIN The queue was empty, and the O_NONBLOCK
flag was set for the message queue description referred to
by mqdes.</p>

<p>EBADF The descriptor specified in mqdes was invalid.</p>

<p>EINTR The call was interrupted by a signal handler; see
signal(7).</p>

<p>EINVAL The call would have blocked, and abs_timeout was
invalid, either because tv_sec was less than zero, or
because tv_nsec was less than zero or greater than 1000
million.</p>

<p>EMSGSIZE msg_len was greater than the mq_msgsize
attribute of the message queue.</p>

<p>ETIMEDOUT The call timed out before a message could be
transferred.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>NOTES On Linux, mq_timedsend() is a system call, and
mq_send() is a library function layered on top of that
system call.</p>
