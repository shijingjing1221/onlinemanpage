<p>NAME aconnect - ALSA sequencer connection manager</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS aconnect [-d] [-options] sender receiver
aconnect -i|-o [-options] aconnect -x</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION aconnect is a utility to connect and
disconnect two existing ports on ALSA sequencer system. The
ports with the arbitrary subscription per- mission, such as
created by aseqview(1), can be connected to any (MIDI)
device ports using aconnect. For example, to connect from
port 64:0 to 65:0, run as follows:</p>

<p>% aconnect 64:0 65:0</p>

<p>The connection is one-way, and the whole data to the
sender port (64:0) is redirected to the receiver port
(65:0). When another port (e.g. 65:1) is attached to the
same sender port, the data is sent to both receiver ports.
For disconnection, use -d option.</p>

<p>% aconnect -d 64:0 65:0</p>

<p>The address can be given using the clients name.</p>

<p>% aconnect External:0 Emu8000:1</p>

<p>Then the port 0 of the client matching with the string
&quot;External&quot; is connected to the port 1 of the
client matching with the &quot;Emu8000&quot;.</p>

<p>Another function of aconnect is to list the present
ports on the given condition. The input ports, which may
become sender ports, can be listed with -i option.</p>

<p>% aconnect -i client 0: System [type=kernel] 0 Timer 1
Announce client 64: External MIDI-0 [type=kernel] 0 MIDI
0-0</p>

<p>Similarly, to see the output ports, use -o flag.</p>

<p>You can remove all existing exported connections using
-x option. This function is useful for terminating the ALSA
drivers, because the mod- ules with sequencer connections
cannot be unloaded unless their connec- tions are
removed.</p>

<p>OPTIONS CONNECTION MANAGEMENT -d, --disconnect
Disconnect the given subscription.</p>

<p>-e, --exclusive Connect ports with exclusive mode. Both
sender and receiver ports can be no longer connected by any
other ports.</p>

<p>-r, --real queue Convert time-stamps of event packets to
the current value of the given real-time queue. This is
option is, however, not so useful, since the receiver port
must use (not necessarily own) the specified queue.</p>

<p>-t, --tick queue Like -r option, but time-stamps are
converted to the current value of the given tick queue.</p>

<p>LIST PORTS -i, --input List existing input (readable)
ports. This option is exclusive to -o.</p>

<p>-o, --output List existing output (writable) ports. This
option is exclusive to -i.</p>

<p>-l, --list List the current connection status. The
connected and connect- ing ports from/to each port are
listed together. The suffix flag [ex] means the connection
is exclusive. The suffix flag [real:#] and [tick:#] mean the
connection includes real-time and tick conversion on the
listed queue, respectively.</p>

<p>REMOVE ALL CONNECTIONS -x, --removeall Remove all
exported connections.</p>
