<p>CSCOPE(1) CSCOPE(1)</p>

<p>NAME cscope - interactively examine a C program</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS cscope [-bCcdehkLlqRTUuVv] [-Fsymfile]
[-freffile] [-Iincdir] [-iname- file] [-[0123456789]pattern]
[-pn] [-sdir] [files]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION cscope is an interactive, screen-oriented
tool that allows the user to browse through C source files
for specified elements of code.</p>

<p>By default, cscope examines the C (.c and .h), lex (.l),
and yacc (.y) source files in the current directory. cscope
may also be invoked for source files named on the command
line. In either case, cscope searches the standard
directories for #include files that it does not find in the
current directory. cscope uses a symbol cross-reference,
called cscope.out by default, to locate functions, function
calls, macros, variables, and preprocessor symbols in the
files.</p>

<p>cscope builds the symbol cross-reference the first time
it is used on the source files for the program being
browsed. On a subsequent invoca- tion, cscope rebuilds the
cross-reference only if a source file has changed or the
list of source files is different. When the cross-refer-
ence is rebuilt, the data for the unchanged files are copied
from the old cross-reference, which makes rebuilding faster
than the initial build.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Some command line arguments can only occur as
the the ony argument in the execution of cscope. They cause
the program to just print out some output and exit
immediately:</p>

<p>-h View the long usage help display.</p>

<p>-V Print on the first line of screen the version number
of cscope.</p>

<p>--help Same as -h</p>

<p>--version Same as -V</p>

<p>The following options can appear in any combination:</p>

<p>-b Build the cross-reference only.</p>

<p>-C Ignore letter case when searching.</p>

<p>-c Use only ASCII characters in the cross-reference
file, that is, do not compress the data.</p>

<p>-d Do not update the cross-reference.</p>

<p>-e Suppress the &lt;Ctrl&gt;-e command prompt between
files.</p>

<p>-Fsymfile Read symbol reference lines from symfile. (A
symbol reference file is created by &gt; and &gt;&gt;, and
can also be read using the &lt; command, described under
Issuing Subsequent Requests, below.)</p>

<p>-freffile Use reffile as the cross-reference file name
instead of the default &quot;cscope.out&quot;.</p>

<p>-Iincdir Look in incdir (before looking in $INCDIR, the
standard place for header files, normally /usr/include) for
any #include files whose names do not begin with / and that
are not specified on the command line or in namefile below.
(The #include files may be specified with either double
quotes or angle brackets.) The incdir directory is searched
in addition to the current directory (which is searched
first) and the standard list (which is searched last). If
more than one occurrence of -I appears, the directories are
searched in the order they appear on the command line.</p>

<p>-inamefile Browse through all source files whose names
are listed in name- file (file names separated by spaces,
tabs, or new-lines) instead of the default name list file,
which is called cscope.files. If this option is specified,
cscope ignores any file names appearing on the command line.
The argument namefile can be set to - to accept a list of
files from the standard input. Filenames in the namefile
that contain whitespace have to be enclosed in &quot;double
quotes&quot;. Inside such quoted file- names, any
double-quote and backslash characters have to be escaped by
backslashes.</p>

<p>-k Kernel Mode, turns off the use of the default include
dir (usually /usr/include) when building the database, since
kernel source trees generally do not use it.</p>

<p>-L Do a single search with line-oriented output when
used with the -num pattern option.</p>

<p>-l Line-oriented interface (see Line-Oriented Interface
below).</p>

<p>-[0-9]pattern Go to input field num (counting from 0)
and find pattern.</p>

<p>-Ppath Prepend path to relative file names in a
pre-built cross-refer- ence file so you do not have to
change to the directory where the cross-reference file was
built. This option is only valid with the -d option.</p>

<p>-pn Display the last n file path components instead of
the default (1). Use 0 to not display the file name at
all.</p>

<p>-q Enable fast symbol lookup via an inverted index. This
option causes cscope to create 2 more files (default names
cscope.in.out and cscope.po.out) in addition to the nor- mal
database. This allows a faster symbol search algorithm that
provides noticeably faster lookup performance for large
projects.</p>

<p>-R Recurse subdirectories during search for source
files.</p>

<p>-sdir Look in dir for additional source files. This
option is ignored if source files are given on the command
line.</p>

<p>-T Use only the first eight characters to match against
C symbols. A regular expression containing special
characters other than a period (.) will not match any symbol
if its minimum length is greater than eight characters.</p>

<p>-U Check file time stamps. This option will update the
time stamp on the database even if no files have
changed.</p>

<p>-u Unconditionally build the cross-reference file
(assume that all files have changed).</p>

<p>-v Be more verbose in line-oriented mode. Output
progress updates during database building and searches.</p>

<p>files A list of file names to operate on.</p>

<p>The -I, -c, -k, -p, -q, and -T options can also be in
the cscope.files file.</p>

<p>Requesting the initial search</p>

<p>After the cross-reference is ready, cscope will display
this menu:</p>

<p>Find this C symbol: Find this function definition: Find
functions called by this function: Find functions calling
this function: Find this text string: Change this text
string: Find this egrep pattern: Find this file: Find files
#including this file:</p>

<p>Press the &lt;Up&gt; or &lt;Down&gt; keys repeatedly to
move to the desired input field, type the text to search
for, and then press the &lt;Return&gt; key.</p>

<p>Issuing subsequent requests If the search is successful,
any of these single-character commands can be used:</p>

<p>0-9a-zA-Z Edit the file referenced by the given line
number.</p>

<p>&lt;Space&gt; Display next set of matching lines.</p>

<p>&lt;Tab&gt; Alternate between the menu and the list of
matching lines</p>

<p>&lt;Up&gt; Move to the previous menu item (if the cursor
is in the menu) or move to the previous matching line (if
the cursor is in the matching line list.)</p>

<p>&lt;Down&gt; Move to the next menu item (if the cursor
is in the menu) or move to the next matching line (if the
cursor is in the matching line list.)</p>

<p>+ Display next set of matching lines.</p>

<p>- Display previous set of matching lines.</p>

<p>^e Edit displayed files in order.</p>

<p>&gt; Write the displayed list of lines to a file.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; Append the displayed list of lines to a
file.</p>

<p>&lt; Read lines from a file that is in symbol reference
format (cre- ated by &gt; or &gt;&gt;), just like the -F
option.</p>

<p>^ Filter all lines through a shell command and display
the result- ing lines, replacing the lines that were already
there.</p>

<p>| Pipe all lines to a shell command and display them
without changing them.</p>

<p>At any time these single-character commands can also be
used:</p>

<p>&lt;Return&gt; Move to next input field.</p>

<p>^n Move to next input field.</p>

<p>^p Move to previous input field.</p>

<p>^y Search with the last text typed.</p>

<p>^b Move to previous input field and search pattern.</p>

<p>^f Move to next input field and search pattern.</p>

<p>^c Toggle ignore/use letter case when searching. (When
ignoring letter case, search for FILE will match File and
file.)</p>

<p>^r Rebuild the cross-reference.</p>

<p>! Start an interactive shell (type ^d to return to
cscope).</p>

<p>^l Redraw the screen.</p>

<p>? Give help information about cscope commands.</p>

<p>^d Exit cscope.</p>

<p>NOTE: If the first character of the text to be searched
for matches one of the above commands, escape it by typing a
(backslash) first.</p>

<p>Substituting new text for old text</p>

<p>After the text to be changed has been typed, cscope will
prompt for the new text, and then it will display the lines
containing the old text. Select the lines to be changed with
these single-character commands:</p>

<p>0-9a-zA-Z Mark or unmark the line to be changed.</p>

<p>* Mark or unmark all displayed lines to be changed.</p>

<p>&lt;Space&gt; Display next set of lines.</p>

<p>+ Display next set of lines.</p>

<p>- Display previous set of lines.</p>

<p>a Mark or unmark all lines to be changed.</p>

<p>^d Change the marked lines and exit.</p>

<p>&lt;Esc&gt; Exit without changing the marked lines.</p>

<p>! Start an interactive shell (type ^d to return to
cscope).</p>

<p>^l Redraw the screen.</p>

<p>? Give help information about cscope commands.</p>

<p>Special keys</p>

<p>If your terminal has arrow keys that work in vi, you can
use them to move around the input fields. The up-arrow key
is useful to move to the previous input field instead of
using the &lt;Tab&gt; key repeatedly. If you have
&lt;CLEAR&gt;, &lt;NEXT&gt;, or &lt;PREV&gt; keys they will
act as the ^l, +, and - commands, respectively.</p>

<p>Line-Oriented interface</p>

<p>The -l option lets you use cscope where a
screen-oriented interface would not be useful, for example,
from another screen-oriented program.</p>

<p>cscope will prompt with &gt;&gt; when it is ready for an
input line starting with the field number (counting from 0)
immediately followed by the search pattern, for example,
lmain finds the definition of the main function.</p>

<p>If you just want a single search, instead of the -l
option use the -L and -num pattern options, and you wont get
the &gt;&gt; prompt.</p>

<p>For -l, cscope outputs the number of reference lines
cscope: 2 lines</p>

<p>For each reference found, cscope outputs a line
consisting of the file name, function name, line number, and
line text, separated by spaces, for example, main.c main 161
main(argc, argv)</p>

<p>Note that the editor is not called to display a single
reference, unlike the screen-oriented interface.</p>

<p>You can use the c command to toggle ignore/use letter
case when search- ing. (When ignoring letter case, search
for FILE will match File and file.)</p>

<p>You can use the r command to rebuild the database.</p>

<p>cscope will quit when it detects end-of-file, or when
the first charac- ter of an input line is ^d or q.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES CSCOPE_EDITOR Overrides the EDITOR
and VIEWER variables. Use this if you wish to use a
different editor with cscope than that specified by your
EDITOR/VIEWER variables.</p>

<p>CSCOPE_LINEFLAG Format of the line number flag for your
editor. By default, cscope invokes your editor via the
equivalent of editor +N file , where N is the line number
that the editor should jump to. This format is used by both
emacs and vi. If your edi- tor needs something different,
specify it in this variable, with %s as a placeholder for
the line number. Ex: if your editor needs to be invoked as
editor -#103 file to go to line 103, set this variable to
-#%s.</p>

<p>CSCOPE_LINEFLAG_AFTER_FILE Set this variable to yes if
your editor needs to be invoked with the line number option
after the filename to be edited. To continue the example
from CSCOPE_LINEFLAG, above: if your editor needs to see
editor file -#number, set this environment variable. Users
of most standard editors (vi, emacs) do not need to set this
variable.</p>

<p>EDITOR Preferred editor, which defaults to vi.</p>

<p>HOME Home directory, which is automatically set at
login.</p>

<p>INCLUDEDIRS Colon-separated list of directories to
search for #include files.</p>

<p>SHELL Preferred shell, which defaults to sh.</p>

<p>SOURCEDIRS Colon-separated list of directories to search
for additional source files.</p>

<p>TERM Terminal type, which must be a screen terminal.</p>

<p>TERMINFO Terminal information directory full path name.
If your terminal is not in the standard terminfo directory,
see curses and terminfo for how to make your own terminal
description.</p>

<p>TMPDIR Temporary file directory, which defaults to
/var/tmp.</p>

<p>VIEWER Preferred file display program (such as less),
which overrides EDITOR (see above).</p>

<p>VPATH A colon-separated list of directories, each of
which has the same directory structure below it. If VPATH is
set, cscope searches for source files in the directories
specified; if it is not set, cscope searches only in the
current directory.</p>

<p>FILES cscope.files Default files containing -I, -p, -q,
and -T options and the list of source files (overridden by
the -i option).</p>

<p>cscope.out Symbol cross-reference file (overridden by
the -f option), which is put in the home directory if it
cannot be created in the cur- rent directory.</p>

<p>cscope.in.out cscope.po.out Default files containing the
inverted index used for quick sym- bol searching (-q
option). If you use the -f option to rename the
cross-reference file (so its not cscope.out), the names for
these inverted index files will be created by adding .in and
.po to the name you supply with -f. For example, if you
indicated -f xyz, then these files would be named xyz.in and
xyz.po.</p>

<p>INCDIR Standard directory for #include files (usually
/usr/include).</p>

<p>Notices cscope recognizes function definitions of the
form: fname blank ( args ) white arg_decs white {</p>

<p>where: fname is the function name</p>

<p>blank is zero or more spaces, tabs, vtabs, form feeds or
carriage returns, not including newlines</p>

<p>args is any string that does not contain a &quot; or a
newline</p>

<p>white is zero or more spaces, tabs, vtabs, form feeds,
carriage returns or newlines</p>

<p>arg_decs are zero or more argument declarations
(arg_decs may include comments and white space)</p>

<p>It is not necessary for a function declaration to start
at the begin- ning of a line. The return type may precede
the function name; cscope will still recognize the
declaration. Function definitions that deviate from this
form will not be recognized by cscope.</p>

<p>The Function column of the search output for the menu
option Find functions called by this function: input field
will only display the first function called in the line,
that is, for this function</p>

<p>e() { return (f() + g()); }</p>

<p>the display would be</p>

<p>Functions called by this function: e File Function Line
a.c f 3 return(f() + g());</p>

<p>Occasionally, a function definition or call may not be
recognized because of braces inside #if statements.
Similarly, the use of a vari- able may be incorrectly
recognized as a definition.</p>

<p>A typedef name preceding a preprocessor statement will
be incorrectly recognized as a global definition, for
example,</p>

<p>LDFILE * #if AR16WR</p>

<p>Preprocessor statements can also prevent the recognition
of a global definition, for example,</p>

<p>char flag #ifdef ALLOCATE_STORAGE = -1 #endif ;</p>

<p>A function declaration inside a function is incorrectly
recognized as a function call, for example,</p>

<p>f() { void g(); }</p>

<p>is incorrectly recognized as a call to g.</p>

<p>cscope recognizes C++ classes by looking for the class
keyword, but doesn t recognize that a struct is also a
class, so it doesnt recog- nize inline member function
definitions in a structure. It also doesnt expect the class
keyword in a typedef , so it incorrectly recognizes X as a
definition in</p>

<p>typedef class X * Y;</p>

<p>It also doesnt recognize operator function
definitions</p>

<p>Bool Feature::operator==(const Feature &amp; other) {
... }</p>

<p>Nor does it recognize function definitions with a
function pointer argument</p>

<p>ParseTable::Recognize(int startState, char *pattern, int
finishState, void (*FinalAction)(char *)) { ... }</p>
