<p>NAME perlhack - How to hack at the Perl internals</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This document attempts to explain how Perl
development takes place, and ends with some suggestions for
people wanting to become bona fide porters.</p>

<p>The perl5-porters mailing list is where the Perl
standard distribution is maintained and developed. The list
can get anywhere from 10 to 150 messages a day, depending on
the heatedness of the debate. Most days there are two or
three patches, extensions, features, or bugs being discussed
at a time.</p>

<p>A searchable archive of the list is at either:</p>


<p>http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/</p>

<p>or</p>


<p>http://archive.develooper.com/perl5-porters@perl.org/</p>

<p>List subscribers (the porters themselves) come in
several flavours. Some are quiet curious lurkers, who rarely
pitch in and instead watch the ongoing development to ensure
theyre forewarned of new changes or features in Perl. Some
are representatives of vendors, who are there to make sure
that Perl continues to compile and work on their platforms.
Some patch any reported bug that they know how to fix, some
are actively patching their pet area (threads, Win32, the
regexp engine), while others seem to do nothing but
complain. In other words, its your usual mix of technical
people.</p>

<p>Over this group of porters presides Larry Wall. He has
the final word in what does and does not change in the Perl
language. Various releases of Perl are shepherded by a
&quot;pumpking&quot;, a porter responsible for gathering
patches, deciding on a patch-by-patch, feature-by-feature
basis what will and will not go into the release. For
instance, Gurusamy Sarathy was the pumpking for the 5.6
release of Perl, and Jarkko Hietaniemi was the pumpking for
the 5.8 release, and Rafael Garcia-Suarez holds the pumpking
crown for the 5.10 release.</p>

<p>In addition, various people are pumpkings for different
things. For instance, Andy Dougherty and Jarkko Hietaniemi
did a grand job as the Configure pumpkin up till the 5.8
release. For the 5.10 release H.Merijn Brand took over.</p>

<p>Larry sees Perl development along the lines of the US
government: theres the Legislature (the porters), the
Executive branch (the pumpkings), and the Supreme Court
(Larry). The legislature can discuss and submit patches to
the executive branch all they like, but the executive branch
is free to veto them. Rarely, the Supreme Court will side
with the executive branch over the legislature, or the
legislature over the executive branch. Mostly, however, the
legislature and the executive branch are supposed to get
along and work out their differences without impeachment or
court cases.</p>

<p>You might sometimes see reference to Rule 1 and Rule 2.
Larrys power as Supreme Court is expressed in The Rules:</p>

<p>1. Larry is always by definition right about how Perl
should behave. This means he has final veto power on the
core functionality.</p>

<p>2. Larry is allowed to change his mind about any matter
at a later date, regardless of whether he previously invoked
Rule 1.</p>

<p>Got that? Larry is always right, even when he was wrong.
Its rare to see either Rule exercised, but they are often
alluded to.</p>

<p>New features and extensions to the language are
contentious, because the criteria used by the pumpkings,
Larry, and other porters to decide which features should be
implemented and incorporated are not codified in a few small
design goals as with some other languages. Instead, the
heuristics are flexible and often difficult to fathom. Here
is one persons list, roughly in decreasing order of
importance, of heuristics that new features have to be
weighed against:</p>

<p>Does concept match the general goals of Perl? These
haven t been written anywhere in stone, but one
approximation is:</p>

<p>1. Keep it fast, simple, and useful. 2. Keep
features/concepts as orthogonal as possible. 3. No arbitrary
limits (platforms, data sizes, cultures). 4. Keep it open
and exciting to use/patch/advocate Perl everywhere. 5.
Either assimilate new technologies, or build bridges to
them.</p>

<p>Where is the implementation? All the talk in the world
is useless without an implementation. In almost every case,
the person or people who argue for a new feature will be
expected to be the ones who implement it. Porters capable of
coding new features have their own agendas, and are not
available to implement your (possibly good) idea.</p>

<p>Backwards compatibility Its a cardinal sin to break
existing Perl programs. New warnings are contentious--some
say that a program that emits warnings is not broken, while
others say it is. Adding keywords has the potential to break
programs, changing the meaning of existing token sequences
or functions might break programs.</p>

<p>Could it be a module instead? Perl 5 has extension
mechanisms, modules and XS, specifically to avoid the need
to keep changing the Perl interpreter. You can write modules
that export functions, you can give those functions
prototypes so they can be called like built-in functions,
you can even write XS code to mess with the runtime data
structures of the Perl interpreter if you want to implement
really complicated things. If it can be done in a module
instead of in the core, its highly unlikely to be added.</p>

<p>Is the feature generic enough? Is this something that
only the submitter wants added to the language, or would it
be broadly useful? Sometimes, instead of adding a feature
with a tight focus, the porters might decide to wait until
someone implements the more generalized feature. For
instance, instead of implementing a &quot;delayed
evaluation&quot; feature, the porters are waiting for a
macro system that would permit delayed evaluation and much
more.</p>

<p>Does it potentially introduce new bugs? Radical rewrites
of large chunks of the Perl interpreter have the potential
to introduce new bugs. The smaller and more localized the
change, the better.</p>

<p>Does it preclude other desirable features? A patch is
likely to be rejected if it closes off future avenues of
development. For instance, a patch that placed a true and
final interpretation on prototypes is likely to be rejected
because there are still options for the future of prototypes
that havent been addressed.</p>

<p>Is the implementation robust? Good patches (tight code,
complete, correct) stand more chance of going in. Sloppy or
incorrect patches might be placed on the back burner until
the pumpking has time to fix, or might be discarded
altogether without further notice.</p>

<p>Is the implementation generic enough to be portable? The
worst patches make use of a system-specific features. Its
highly unlikely that non-portable additions to the Perl
language will be accepted.</p>

<p>Is the implementation tested? Patches which change
behaviour (fixing bugs or introducing new features) must
include regression tests to verify that everything works as
expected. Without tests provided by the original author, how
can anyone else changing perl in the future be sure that
they havent unwittingly broken the behaviour the patch
implements? And without tests, how can the patchs author be
confident that his/her hard work put into the patch won t be
accidentally thrown away by someone in the future?</p>

<p>Is there enough documentation? Patches without
documentation are probably ill-thought out or incomplete.
Nothing can be added without documentation, so submitting a
patch for the appropriate manpages as well as the source
code is always a good idea.</p>

<p>Is there another way to do it? Larry said &quot;Although
the Perl Slogan is There_s More Than One Way to Do It, I
hesitate to make 10 ways to do something&quot;. This is a
tricky heuristic to navigate, though--one man s essential
addition is another mans pointless cruft.</p>

<p>Does it create too much work? Work for the pumpking,
work for Perl programmers, work for module authors, ... Perl
is supposed to be easy.</p>

<p>Patches speak louder than words Working code is always
preferred to pie-in-the-sky ideas. A patch to add a feature
stands a much higher chance of making it to the language
than does a random feature request, no matter how fervently
argued the request might be. This ties into &quot;Will it be
useful?&quot;, as the fact that someone took the time to
make the patch demonstrates a strong desire for the
feature.</p>

<p>If you re on the list, you might hear the word
&quot;core&quot; bandied around. It refers to the standard
distribution. &quot;Hacking on the core&quot; means you re
changing the C source code to the Perl interpreter. &quot;A
core module&quot; is one that ships with Perl.</p>

<p>Keeping in sync The source code to the Perl interpreter,
in its different versions, is kept in a repository managed
by the git revision control system. The pumpkings and a few
others have write access to the repository to check in
changes.</p>

<p>How to clone and use the git perl repository is
described in perlrepository.</p>

<p>You can also choose to use rsync to get a copy of the
current source tree for the bleadperl branch and all
maintenance branches :</p>

<p>$ rsync -avz rsync://perl5.git.perl.org/APC/perl-current
. $ rsync -avz rsync://perl5.git.perl.org/APC/perl-5.10.x .
$ rsync -avz rsync://perl5.git.perl.org/APC/perl-5.8.x . $
rsync -avz rsync://perl5.git.perl.org/APC/perl-5.6.x . $
rsync -avz rsync://perl5.git.perl.org/APC/perl-5.005xx .</p>

<p>(Add the &quot;--delete&quot; option to remove leftover
files)</p>

<p>You may also want to subscribe to the perl5-changes
mailing list to receive a copy of each patch that gets
submitted to the maintenance and development
&quot;branches&quot; of the perl repository. See
http://lists.perl.org/ for subscription information.</p>

<p>If you are a member of the perl5-porters mailing list,
it is a good thing to keep in touch with the most recent
changes. If not only to verify if what you would have posted
as a bug report isnt already solved in the most recent
available perl development branch, also known as
perl-current, bleading edge perl, bleedperl or
bleadperl.</p>

<p>Needless to say, the source code in perl-current is
usually in a perpetual state of evolution. You should expect
it to be very buggy. Do not use it for any purpose other
than testing and development.</p>

<p>Perlbug administration There is a single remote
administrative interface for modifying bug status, category,
open issues etc. using the RT bugtracker system, maintained
by Robert Spier. Become an administrator, and close any bugs
you can get your sticky mitts on:</p>

<p>http://bugs.perl.org/</p>

<p>To email the bug system administrators:</p>

<p>&quot;perlbug-admin&quot;
&lt;perlbug-admin@perl.org&gt;</p>

<p>Submitting patches Always submit patches to
perl5-porters@perl.org. If youre patching a core module and
theres an author listed, send the author a copy (see
&quot;Patching a core module&quot;). This lets other porters
review your patch, which catches a surprising number of
errors in patches. Please patch against the latest
development version. (e.g., even if you re fixing a bug in
the 5.8 track, patch against the &quot;blead&quot; branch in
the git repository.)</p>

<p>If changes are accepted, they are applied to the
development branch. Then the maintenance pumpking decides
which of those patches is to be backported to the maint
branch. Only patches that survive the heat of the
development branch get applied to maintenance versions.</p>

<p>Your patch should update the documentation and test
suite. See &quot;Writing a test&quot;. If you have added or
removed files in the distribution, edit the MANIFEST file
accordingly, sort the MANIFEST file using &quot;make
manisort&quot;, and include those changes as part of your
patch.</p>

<p>Patching documentation also follows the same order: if
accepted, a patch is first applied to development, and if
relevant then its backported to maintenance. (With an
exception for some patches that document behaviour that only
appears in the maintenance branch, but which has changed in
the development version.)</p>

<p>To report a bug in Perl, use the program perlbug which
comes with Perl (if you cant get Perl to work, send mail to
the address perlbug@perl.org or perlbug@perl.com). Reporting
bugs through perlbug feeds into the automated bug-tracking
system, access to which is provided through the web at
http://rt.perl.org/rt3/ . It often pays to check the
archives of the perl5-porters mailing list to see whether
the bug you re reporting has been reported before, and if so
whether it was considered a bug. See above for the location
of the searchable archives.</p>

<p>The CPAN testers ( http://testers.cpan.org/ ) are a
group of volunteers who test CPAN modules on a variety of
platforms. Perl Smokers (
http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.daily-build and
http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.daily-build.reports/ )
automatically test Perl source releases on platforms with
various configurations. Both efforts welcome volunteers. In
order to get involved in smoke testing of the perl itself
visit &lt;http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-Smoke&gt;. In
order to start smoke testing CPAN modules visit
&lt;http://search.cpan.org/dist/CPAN-YACSmoke/&gt; or
&lt;http://search.cpan.org/dist/POE-Component-CPAN-YACSmoke/&gt;
or &lt;http://search.cpan.org/dist/CPAN-Reporter/&gt;.</p>

<p>It s a good idea to read and lurk for a while before
chipping in. That way youll get to see the dynamic of the
conversations, learn the personalities of the players, and
hopefully be better prepared to make a useful contribution
when do you speak up.</p>

<p>If after all this you still think you want to join the
perl5-porters mailing list, send mail to
perl5-porters-subscribe@perl.org. To unsubscribe, send mail
to perl5-porters-unsubscribe@perl.org.</p>

<p>To hack on the Perl guts, youll need to read the
following things:</p>

<p>perlguts This is of paramount importance, since it s the
documentation of what goes where in the Perl source. Read it
over a couple of times and it might start to make sense -
don t worry if it doesnt yet, because the best way to study
it is to read it in conjunction with poking at Perl source,
and well do that later on.</p>

<p>Gisle Aas s illustrated perlguts (aka: illguts) is
wonderful, although a little out of date wrt some size
details; the various SV structures have since been reworked
for smaller memory footprint. The fundamentals are right
however, and the pictures are very helpful.</p>


<p>http://www.perl.org/tpc/1998/Perl_Language_and_Modules/Perl%20Illustrated/</p>

<p>perlxstut and perlxs A working knowledge of XSUB
programming is incredibly useful for core hacking; XSUBs use
techniques drawn from the PP code, the portion of the guts
that actually executes a Perl program. Its a lot gentler to
learn those techniques from simple examples and explanation
than from the core itself.</p>

<p>perlapi The documentation for the Perl API explains what
some of the internal functions do, as well as the many
macros used in the source.</p>

<p>Porting/pumpkin.pod This is a collection of words of
wisdom for a Perl porter; some of it is only useful to the
pumpkin holder, but most of it applies to anyone wanting to
go about Perl development.</p>

<p>The perl5-porters FAQ This should be available from
http://dev.perl.org/perl5/docs/p5p-faq.html . It contains
hints on reading perl5-porters, information on how
perl5-porters works and how Perl development in general
works.</p>

<p>Finding Your Way Around Perl maintenance can be split
into a number of areas, and certain people (pumpkins) will
have responsibility for each area. These areas sometimes
correspond to files or directories in the source kit. Among
the areas are:</p>

<p>Core modules Modules shipped as part of the Perl core
live in the lib/ and ext/ subdirectories: lib/ is for the
pure-Perl modules, and ext/ contains the core XS
modules.</p>

<p>Tests There are tests for nearly all the modules,
built-ins and major bits of functionality. Test files all
have a .t suffix. Module tests live in the lib/ and ext/
directories next to the module being tested. Others live in
t/. See &quot;Writing a test&quot;</p>

<p>Documentation Documentation maintenance includes looking
after everything in the pod/ directory, (as well as
contributing new documentation) and the documentation to the
modules in core.</p>

<p>Configure The configure process is the way we make Perl
portable across the myriad of operating systems it supports.
Responsibility for the configure, build and installation
process, as well as the overall portability of the core code
rests with the configure pumpkin - others help out with
individual operating systems.</p>

<p>The files involved are the operating system directories,
(win32/, os2/, vms/ and so on) the shell scripts which
generate config.h and Makefile, as well as the metaconfig
files which generate Configure. (metaconfig isnt included in
the core distribution.)</p>

<p>Interpreter And of course, theres the core of the Perl
interpreter itself. Lets have a look at that in a little
more detail.</p>

<p>Before we leave looking at the layout, though, dont
forget that MANIFEST contains not only the file names in the
Perl distribution, but short descriptions of whats in them,
too. For an overview of the important files, try this:</p>

<p>perl -lne &rsquo;print if /^[^]+.[ch]&rsquo;
MANIFEST</p>

<p>Elements of the interpreter The work of the interpreter
has two main stages: compiling the code into the internal
representation, or bytecode, and then executing it.
&quot;Compiled code&quot; in perlguts explains exactly how
the compilation stage happens.</p>

<p>Here is a short breakdown of perls operation:</p>

<p>Startup The action begins in perlmain.c. (or
miniperlmain.c for miniperl) This is very high-level code,
enough to fit on a single screen, and it resembles the code
found in perlembed; most of the real action takes place in
perl.c</p>

<p>perlmain.c is generated by writemain from miniperlmain.c
at make time, so you should make perl to follow this
along.</p>

<p>First, perlmain.c allocates some memory and constructs a
Perl interpreter, along these lines:</p>

<p>1 PERL_SYS_INIT3(&amp;argc,&amp;argv,&amp;env); 2 3 if
(!PL_do_undump) { 4 my_perl = perl_alloc(); 5 if (!my_perl)
6 exit(1); 7 perl_construct(my_perl); 8
PL_perl_destruct_level = 0; 9 }</p>

<p>Line 1 is a macro, and its definition is dependent on
your operating system. Line 3 references
&quot;PL_do_undump&quot;, a global variable - all global
variables in Perl start with &quot;PL_&quot;. This tells you
whether the current running program was created with the
&quot;-u&quot; flag to perl and then undump, which means its
going to be false in any sane context.</p>

<p>Line 4 calls a function in perl.c to allocate memory for
a Perl interpreter. Its quite a simple function, and the
guts of it looks like this:</p>

<p>my_perl =
(PerlInterpreter*)PerlMem_malloc(sizeof(PerlInterpreter));</p>

<p>Here you see an example of Perl s system abstraction,
which well see later: &quot;PerlMem_malloc&quot; is either
your systems &quot;malloc&quot;, or Perls own
&quot;malloc&quot; as defined in malloc.c if you selected
that option at configure time.</p>

<p>Next, in line 7, we construct the interpreter using
perl_construct, also in perl.c; this sets up all the special
variables that Perl needs, the stacks, and so on.</p>

<p>Now we pass Perl the command line options, and tell it
to go:</p>

<p>exitstatus = perl_parse(my_perl, xs_init, argc, argv,
(char **)NULL); if (!exitstatus) perl_run(my_perl);</p>

<p>exitstatus = perl_destruct(my_perl);</p>

<p>perl_free(my_perl);</p>

<p>&quot;perl_parse&quot; is actually a wrapper around
&quot;S_parse_body&quot;, as defined in perl.c, which
processes the command line options, sets up any statically
linked XS modules, opens the program and calls
&quot;yyparse&quot; to parse it.</p>

<p>Parsing The aim of this stage is to take the Perl
source, and turn it into an op tree. We ll see what one of
those looks like later. Strictly speaking, theres three
things going on here.</p>

<p>&quot;yyparse&quot;, the parser, lives in perly.c,
although youre better off reading the original YACC input in
perly.y. (Yes, Virginia, there is a YACC grammar for Perl!)
The job of the parser is to take your code and
&quot;understand&quot; it, splitting it into sentences,
deciding which operands go with which operators and so
on.</p>

<p>The parser is nobly assisted by the lexer, which chunks
up your input into tokens, and decides what type of thing
each token is: a variable name, an operator, a bareword, a
subroutine, a core function, and so on. The main point of
entry to the lexer is &quot;yylex&quot;, and that and its
associated routines can be found in toke.c. Perl isnt much
like other computer languages; its highly context sensitive
at times, it can be tricky to work out what sort of token
something is, or where a token ends. As such, theres a lot
of interplay between the tokeniser and the parser, which can
get pretty frightening if youre not used to it.</p>

<p>As the parser understands a Perl program, it builds up a
tree of operations for the interpreter to perform during
execution. The routines which construct and link together
the various operations are to be found in op.c, and will be
examined later.</p>

<p>Optimization Now the parsing stage is complete, and the
finished tree represents the operations that the Perl
interpreter needs to perform to execute our program. Next,
Perl does a dry run over the tree looking for optimisations:
constant expressions such as &quot;3 + 4&quot; will be
computed now, and the optimizer will also see if any
multiple operations can be replaced with a single one. For
instance, to fetch the variable $foo, instead of grabbing
the glob *foo and looking at the scalar component, the
optimizer fiddles the op tree to use a function which
directly looks up the scalar in question. The main optimizer
is &quot;peep&quot; in op.c, and many ops have their own
optimizing functions.</p>

<p>Running Now were finally ready to go: we have compiled
Perl byte code, and all thats left to do is run it. The
actual execution is done by the &quot;runops_standard&quot;
function in run.c; more specifically, its done by these
three innocent looking lines:</p>

<p>while ((PL_op = CALL_FPTR(PL_op-&gt;op_ppaddr)(aTHX))) {
PERL_ASYNC_CHECK(); }</p>

<p>You may be more comfortable with the Perl version of
that:</p>

<p>PERL_ASYNC_CHECK() while $Perl::op =
&amp;{$Perl::op-&gt;{function}};</p>

<p>Well, maybe not. Anyway, each op contains a function
pointer, which stipulates the function which will actually
carry out the operation. This function will return the next
op in the sequence - this allows for things like
&quot;if&quot; which choose the next op dynamically at run
time. The &quot;PERL_ASYNC_CHECK&quot; makes sure that
things like signals interrupt execution if required.</p>

<p>The actual functions called are known as PP code, and
theyre spread between four files: pp_hot.c contains the
&quot;hot&quot; code, which is most often used and highly
optimized, pp_sys.c contains all the system- specific
functions, pp_ctl.c contains the functions which implement
control structures (&quot;if&quot;, &quot;while&quot; and
the like) and pp.c contains everything else. These are, if
you like, the C code for Perls built-in functions and
operators.</p>

<p>Note that each &quot;pp_&quot; function is expected to
return a pointer to the next op. Calls to perl subs (and
eval blocks) are handled within the same runops loop, and do
not consume extra space on the C stack. For example,
&quot;pp_entersub&quot; and &quot;pp_entertry&quot; just
push a &quot;CxSUB&quot; or &quot;CxEVAL&quot; block struct
onto the context stack which contain the address of the op
following the sub call or eval. They then return the first
op of that sub or eval block, and so execution continues of
that sub or block. Later, a &quot;pp_leavesub&quot; or
&quot;pp_leavetry&quot; op pops the &quot;CxSUB&quot; or
&quot;CxEVAL&quot;, retrieves the return op from it, and
returns it.</p>

<p>Exception handing Perls exception handing (i.e.
&quot;die&quot; etc.) is built on top of the low-level
&quot;setjmp()&quot;/&quot;longjmp()&quot; C-library
functions. These basically provide a way to capture the
current PC and SP registers and later restore them; i.e. a
&quot;longjmp()&quot; continues at the point in code where a
previous &quot;setjmp()&quot; was done, with anything
further up on the C stack being lost. This is why code
should always save values using &quot;SAVE_FOO&quot; rather
than in auto variables.</p>

<p>The perl core wraps &quot;setjmp()&quot; etc in the
macros &quot;JMPENV_PUSH&quot; and &quot;JMPENV_JUMP&quot;.
The basic rule of perl exceptions is that &quot;exit&quot;,
and &quot;die&quot; (in the absence of &quot;eval&quot;)
perform a JMPENV_JUMP(2), while &quot;die&quot; within
&quot;eval&quot; does a JMPENV_JUMP(3).</p>

<p>At entry points to perl, such as
&quot;perl_parse()&quot;, &quot;perl_run()&quot; and
&quot;call_sv(cv, G_EVAL)&quot; each does a
&quot;JMPENV_PUSH&quot;, then enter a runops loop or
whatever, and handle possible exception returns. For a 2
return, final cleanup is performed, such as popping stacks
and calling &quot;CHECK&quot; or &quot;END&quot; blocks.
Amongst other things, this is how scope cleanup still occurs
during an &quot;exit&quot;.</p>

<p>If a &quot;die&quot; can find a &quot;CxEVAL&quot; block
on the context stack, then the stack is popped to that level
and the return op in that block is assigned to
&quot;PL_restartop&quot;; then a JMPENV_JUMP(3) is
performed. This normally passes control back to the guard.
In the case of &quot;perl_run&quot; and &quot;call_sv&quot;,
a non-null &quot;PL_restartop&quot; triggers re- entry to
the runops loop. The is the normal way that &quot;die&quot;
or &quot;croak&quot; is handled within an
&quot;eval&quot;.</p>

<p>Sometimes ops are executed within an inner runops loop,
such as tie, sort or overload code. In this case, something
like</p>

<p>sub FETCH { eval { die } }</p>

<p>would cause a longjmp right back to the guard in
&quot;perl_run&quot;, popping both runops loops, which is
clearly incorrect. One way to avoid this is for the tie code
to do a &quot;JMPENV_PUSH&quot; before executing
&quot;FETCH&quot; in the inner runops loop, but for
efficiency reasons, perl in fact just sets a flag, using
&quot;CATCH_SET(TRUE)&quot;. The &quot;pp_require&quot;,
&quot;pp_entereval&quot; and &quot;pp_entertry&quot; ops
check this flag, and if true, they call &quot;docatch&quot;,
which does a &quot;JMPENV_PUSH&quot; and starts a new runops
level to execute the code, rather than doing it on the
current loop.</p>

<p>As a further optimisation, on exit from the eval block
in the &quot;FETCH&quot;, execution of the code following
the block is still carried on in the inner loop. When an
exception is raised, &quot;docatch&quot; compares the
&quot;JMPENV&quot; level of the &quot;CxEVAL&quot; with
&quot;PL_top_env&quot; and if they differ, just re-throws
the exception. In this way any inner loops get popped.</p>

<p>Heres an example.</p>

<p>1: eval { tie @a, &rsquo;A&rsquo; }; 2: sub A::TIEARRAY
{ 3: eval { die }; 4: die; 5: }</p>

<p>To run this code, &quot;perl_run&quot; is called, which
does a &quot;JMPENV_PUSH&quot; then enters a runops loop.
This loop executes the eval and tie ops on line 1, with the
eval pushing a &quot;CxEVAL&quot; onto the context
stack.</p>

<p>The &quot;pp_tie&quot; does a
&quot;CATCH_SET(TRUE)&quot;, then starts a second runops
loop to execute the body of &quot;TIEARRAY&quot;. When it
executes the entertry op on line 3, &quot;CATCH_GET&quot; is
true, so &quot;pp_entertry&quot; calls &quot;docatch&quot;
which does a &quot;JMPENV_PUSH&quot; and starts a third
runops loop, which then executes the die op. At this point
the C call stack looks like this:</p>

<p>Perl_pp_die Perl_runops # third loop S_docatch_body
S_docatch Perl_pp_entertry Perl_runops # second loop
S_call_body Perl_call_sv Perl_pp_tie Perl_runops # first
loop S_run_body perl_run main</p>

<p>and the context and data stacks, as shown by
&quot;-Dstv&quot;, look like:</p>

<p>STACK 0: MAIN CX 0: BLOCK =&gt; CX 1: EVAL =&gt; AV()
PV(&quot;A&quot; ) retop=leave STACK 1: MAGIC CX 0: SUB
=&gt; retop=(null) CX 1: EVAL =&gt; * retop=nextstate</p>

<p>The die pops the first &quot;CxEVAL&quot; off the
context stack, sets &quot;PL_restartop&quot; from it, does a
JMPENV_JUMP(3), and control returns to the top
&quot;docatch&quot;. This then starts another third-level
runops level, which executes the nextstate, pushmark and die
ops on line 4. At the point that the second
&quot;pp_die&quot; is called, the C call stack looks exactly
like that above, even though we are no longer within an
inner eval; this is because of the optimization mentioned
earlier. However, the context stack now looks like this, ie
with the top CxEVAL popped:</p>

<p>STACK 0: MAIN CX 0: BLOCK =&gt; CX 1: EVAL =&gt; AV()
PV(&quot;A&quot; ) retop=leave STACK 1: MAGIC CX 0: SUB
=&gt; retop=(null)</p>

<p>The die on line 4 pops the context stack back down to
the CxEVAL, leaving it as:</p>

<p>STACK 0: MAIN CX 0: BLOCK =&gt;</p>

<p>As usual, &quot;PL_restartop&quot; is extracted from the
&quot;CxEVAL&quot;, and a JMPENV_JUMP(3) done, which pops
the C stack back to the docatch:</p>

<p>S_docatch Perl_pp_entertry Perl_runops # second loop
S_call_body Perl_call_sv Perl_pp_tie Perl_runops # first
loop S_run_body perl_run main</p>

<p>In this case, because the &quot;JMPENV&quot; level
recorded in the &quot;CxEVAL&quot; differs from the current
one, &quot;docatch&quot; just does a JMPENV_JUMP(3) and the
C stack unwinds to:</p>

<p>perl_run main</p>

<p>Because &quot;PL_restartop&quot; is non-null,
&quot;run_body&quot; starts a new runops loop and execution
continues.</p>

<p>Internal Variable Types You should by now have had a
look at perlguts, which tells you about Perls internal
variable types: SVs, HVs, AVs and the rest. If not, do that
now.</p>

<p>These variables are used not only to represent
Perl-space variables, but also any constants in the code, as
well as some structures completely internal to Perl. The
symbol table, for instance, is an ordinary Perl hash. Your
code is represented by an SV as its read into the parser;
any program files you call are opened via ordinary Perl
filehandles, and so on.</p>

<p>The core Devel::Peek module lets us examine SVs from a
Perl program. Lets see, for instance, how Perl treats the
constant &quot;hello&quot;.</p>

<p>% perl -MDevel::Peek -e
&rsquo;Dump(&quot;hello&quot;)&rsquo; 1 SV = PV(0xa041450)
at 0xa04ecbc 2 REFCNT = 1 3 FLAGS = (POK,READONLY,pPOK) 4 PV
= 0xa0484e0 &quot;hello&quot; 5 CUR = 5 6 LEN = 6</p>

<p>Reading &quot;Devel::Peek&quot; output takes a bit of
practise, so lets go through it line by line.</p>

<p>Line 1 tells us were looking at an SV which lives at
0xa04ecbc in memory. SVs themselves are very simple
structures, but they contain a pointer to a more complex
structure. In this case, it s a PV, a structure which holds
a string value, at location 0xa041450. Line 2 is the
reference count; there are no other references to this data,
so its 1.</p>

<p>Line 3 are the flags for this SV - its OK to use it as a
PV, its a read-only SV (because its a constant) and the data
is a PV internally. Next we ve got the contents of the
string, starting at location 0xa0484e0.</p>

<p>Line 5 gives us the current length of the string - note
that this does not include the null terminator. Line 6 is
not the length of the string, but the length of the
currently allocated buffer; as the string grows, Perl
automatically extends the available storage via a routine
called &quot;SvGROW&quot;.</p>

<p>You can get at any of these quantities from C very
easily; just add &quot;Sv&quot; to the name of the field
shown in the snippet, and youve got a macro which will
return the value: &quot;SvCUR(sv)&quot; returns the current
length of the string, &quot;SvREFCOUNT(sv)&quot; returns the
reference count, &quot;SvPV(sv, len)&quot; returns the
string itself with its length, and so on. More macros to
manipulate these properties can be found in perlguts.</p>

<p>Let s take an example of manipulating a PV, from
&quot;sv_catpvn&quot;, in sv.c</p>

<p>1 void 2 Perl_sv_catpvn(pTHX_ register SV *sv, register
const char *ptr, register STRLEN len) 3 { 4 STRLEN tlen; 5
char *junk;</p>

<p>6 junk = SvPV_force(sv, tlen); 7 SvGROW(sv, tlen + len +
1); 8 if (ptr == junk) 9 ptr = SvPVX(sv); 10
Move(ptr,SvPVX(sv)+tlen,len,char); 11 SvCUR(sv) += len; 12
*SvEND(sv) = &rsquo; &rsquo;; 13 (void)SvPOK_only_UTF8(sv);
/* validate pointer */ 14 SvTAINT(sv); 15 }</p>

<p>This is a function which adds a string, &quot;ptr&quot;,
of length &quot;len&quot; onto the end of the PV stored in
&quot;sv&quot;. The first thing we do in line 6 is make sure
that the SV has a valid PV, by calling the
&quot;SvPV_force&quot; macro to force a PV. As a side
effect, &quot;tlen&quot; gets set to the current value of
the PV, and the PV itself is returned to
&quot;junk&quot;.</p>

<p>In line 7, we make sure that the SV will have enough
room to accommodate the old string, the new string and the
null terminator. If &quot;LEN&quot; isnt big enough,
&quot;SvGROW&quot; will reallocate space for us.</p>

<p>Now, if &quot;junk&quot; is the same as the string we re
trying to add, we can grab the string directly from the SV;
&quot;SvPVX&quot; is the address of the PV in the SV.</p>

<p>Line 10 does the actual catenation: the &quot;Move&quot;
macro moves a chunk of memory around: we move the string
&quot;ptr&quot; to the end of the PV - thats the start of
the PV plus its current length. We re moving &quot;len&quot;
bytes of type &quot;char&quot;. After doing so, we need to
tell Perl weve extended the string, by altering
&quot;CUR&quot; to reflect the new length. &quot;SvEND&quot;
is a macro which gives us the end of the string, so that
needs to be a &quot; &quot;.</p>

<p>Line 13 manipulates the flags; since weve changed the
PV, any IV or NV values will no longer be valid: if we have
&quot;$a=10; $a.=&quot;6&quot;;&quot; we dont want to use
the old IV of 10. &quot;SvPOK_only_utf8&quot; is a special
UTF-8-aware version of &quot;SvPOK_only&quot;, a macro which
turns off the IOK and NOK flags and turns on POK. The final
&quot;SvTAINT&quot; is a macro which launders tainted data
if taint mode is turned on.</p>

<p>AVs and HVs are more complicated, but SVs are by far the
most common variable type being thrown around. Having seen
something of how we manipulate these, lets go on and look at
how the op tree is constructed.</p>

<p>Op Trees First, what is the op tree, anyway? The op tree
is the parsed representation of your program, as we saw in
our section on parsing, and its the sequence of operations
that Perl goes through to execute your program, as we saw in
&quot;Running&quot;.</p>

<p>An op is a fundamental operation that Perl can perform:
all the built- in functions and operators are ops, and there
are a series of ops which deal with concepts the interpreter
needs internally - entering and leaving a block, ending a
statement, fetching a variable, and so on.</p>

<p>The op tree is connected in two ways: you can imagine
that there are two &quot;routes&quot; through it, two orders
in which you can traverse the tree. First, parse order
reflects how the parser understood the code, and secondly,
execution order tells perl what order to perform the
operations in.</p>

<p>The easiest way to examine the op tree is to stop Perl
after it has finished parsing, and get it to dump out the
tree. This is exactly what the compiler backends B::Terse,
B::Concise and B::Debug do.</p>

<p>Lets have a look at how Perl sees &quot;$a = $b +
$c&quot;:</p>

<p>% perl -MO=Terse -e &rsquo;$a=$b+$c&rsquo; 1 LISTOP
(0x8179888) leave 2 OP (0x81798b0) enter 3 COP (0x8179850)
nextstate 4 BINOP (0x8179828) sassign 5 BINOP (0x8179800)
add [1] 6 UNOP (0x81796e0) null [15] 7 SVOP (0x80fafe0) gvsv
GV (0x80fa4cc) *b 8 UNOP (0x81797e0) null [15] 9 SVOP
(0x8179700) gvsv GV (0x80efeb0) *c 10 UNOP (0x816b4f0) null
[15] 11 SVOP (0x816dcf0) gvsv GV (0x80fa460) *a</p>

<p>Let s start in the middle, at line 4. This is a BINOP, a
binary operator, which is at location 0x8179828. The
specific operator in question is &quot;sassign&quot; -
scalar assignment - and you can find the code which
implements it in the function &quot;pp_sassign&quot; in
pp_hot.c. As a binary operator, it has two children: the add
operator, providing the result of &quot;$b+$c&quot;, is
uppermost on line 5, and the left hand side is on line
10.</p>

<p>Line 10 is the null op: this does exactly nothing. What
is that doing there? If you see the null op, its a sign that
something has been optimized away after parsing. As we
mentioned in &quot;Optimization&quot;, the optimization
stage sometimes converts two operations into one, for
example when fetching a scalar variable. When this happens,
instead of rewriting the op tree and cleaning up the
dangling pointers, its easier just to replace the redundant
operation with the null op. Originally, the tree would have
looked like this:</p>

<p>10 SVOP (0x816b4f0) rv2sv [15] 11 SVOP (0x816dcf0) gv GV
(0x80fa460) *a</p>

<p>That is, fetch the &quot;a&quot; entry from the main
symbol table, and then look at the scalar component of it:
&quot;gvsv&quot; (&quot;pp_gvsv&quot; into pp_hot.c) happens
to do both these things.</p>

<p>The right hand side, starting at line 5 is similar to
what weve just seen: we have the &quot;add&quot; op
(&quot;pp_add&quot; also in pp_hot.c) add together two
&quot;gvsv&quot;s.</p>

<p>Now, whats this about?</p>

<p>1 LISTOP (0x8179888) leave 2 OP (0x81798b0) enter 3 COP
(0x8179850) nextstate</p>

<p>&quot;enter&quot; and &quot;leave&quot; are scoping ops,
and their job is to perform any housekeeping every time you
enter and leave a block: lexical variables are tidied up,
unreferenced variables are destroyed, and so on. Every
program will have those first three lines: &quot;leave&quot;
is a list, and its children are all the statements in the
block. Statements are delimited by &quot;nextstate&quot;, so
a block is a collection of &quot;nextstate&quot; ops, with
the ops to be performed for each statement being the
children of &quot;nextstate&quot;. &quot;enter&quot; is a
single op which functions as a marker.</p>

<p>Thats how Perl parsed the program, from top to
bottom:</p>

<p>Program | Statement | = / / $a + / $b $c</p>

<p>However, its impossible to perform the operations in
this order: you have to find the values of $b and $c before
you add them together, for instance. So, the other thread
that runs through the op tree is the execution order: each
op has a field &quot;op_next&quot; which points to the next
op to be run, so following these pointers tells us how perl
executes the code. We can traverse the tree in this order
using the &quot;exec&quot; option to
&quot;B::Terse&quot;:</p>

<p>% perl -MO=Terse,exec -e &rsquo;$a=$b+$c&rsquo; 1 OP
(0x8179928) enter 2 COP (0x81798c8) nextstate 3 SVOP
(0x81796c8) gvsv GV (0x80fa4d4) *b 4 SVOP (0x8179798) gvsv
GV (0x80efeb0) *c 5 BINOP (0x8179878) add [1] 6 SVOP
(0x816dd38) gvsv GV (0x80fa468) *a 7 BINOP (0x81798a0)
sassign 8 LISTOP (0x8179900) leave</p>

<p>This probably makes more sense for a human: enter a
block, start a statement. Get the values of $b and $c, and
add them together. Find $a, and assign one to the other.
Then leave.</p>

<p>The way Perl builds up these op trees in the parsing
process can be unravelled by examining perly.y, the YACC
grammar. Let s take the piece we need to construct the tree
for &quot;$a = $b + $c&quot;</p>

<p>1 term : term ASSIGNOP term 2 { $$ =
newASSIGNOP(OPf_STACKED, $1, $2, $3); } 3 | term ADDOP term
4 { $$ = newBINOP($2, 0, scalar($1), scalar($3)); }</p>

<p>If youre not used to reading BNF grammars, this is how
it works: Youre fed certain things by the tokeniser, which
generally end up in upper case. Here, &quot;ADDOP&quot;, is
provided when the tokeniser sees &quot;+&quot; in your code.
&quot;ASSIGNOP&quot; is provided when &quot;=&quot; is used
for assigning. These are &quot;terminal symbols&quot;,
because you cant get any simpler than them.</p>

<p>The grammar, lines one and three of the snippet above,
tells you how to build up more complex forms. These complex
forms, &quot;non-terminal symbols&quot; are generally placed
in lower case. &quot;term&quot; here is a non- terminal
symbol, representing a single expression.</p>

<p>The grammar gives you the following rule: you can make
the thing on the left of the colon if you see all the things
on the right in sequence. This is called a
&quot;reduction&quot;, and the aim of parsing is to
completely reduce the input. There are several different
ways you can perform a reduction, separated by vertical
bars: so, &quot;term&quot; followed by &quot;=&quot;
followed by &quot;term&quot; makes a &quot;term&quot;, and
&quot;term&quot; followed by &quot;+&quot; followed by
&quot;term&quot; can also make a &quot;term&quot;.</p>

<p>So, if you see two terms with an &quot;=&quot; or
&quot;+&quot;, between them, you can turn them into a single
expression. When you do this, you execute the code in the
block on the next line: if you see &quot;=&quot;, youll do
the code in line 2. If you see &quot;+&quot;, youll do the
code in line 4. It s this code which contributes to the op
tree.</p>

<p>| term ADDOP term { $$ = newBINOP($2, 0, scalar($1),
scalar($3)); }</p>

<p>What this does is creates a new binary op, and feeds it
a number of variables. The variables refer to the tokens: $1
is the first token in the input, $2 the second, and so on -
think regular expression backreferences. $$ is the op
returned from this reduction. So, we call
&quot;newBINOP&quot; to create a new binary operator. The
first parameter to &quot;newBINOP&quot;, a function in op.c,
is the op type. Its an addition operator, so we want the
type to be &quot;ADDOP&quot;. We could specify this
directly, but its right there as the second token in the
input, so we use $2. The second parameter is the op s flags:
0 means &quot;nothing special&quot;. Then the things to add:
the left and right hand side of our expression, in scalar
context.</p>

<p>Stacks When perl executes something like
&quot;addop&quot;, how does it pass on its results to the
next op? The answer is, through the use of stacks. Perl has
a number of stacks to store things it s currently working
on, and well look at the three most important ones here.</p>

<p>Argument stack Arguments are passed to PP code and
returned from PP code using the argument stack,
&quot;ST&quot;. The typical way to handle arguments is to
pop them off the stack, deal with them how you wish, and
then push the result back onto the stack. This is how, for
instance, the cosine operator works:</p>

<p>NV value; value = POPn; value = Perl_cos(value);
XPUSHn(value);</p>

<p>Well see a more tricky example of this when we consider
Perls macros below. &quot;POPn&quot; gives you the NV
(floating point value) of the top SV on the stack: the $x in
&quot;cos($x)&quot;. Then we compute the cosine, and push
the result back as an NV. The &quot;X&quot; in
&quot;XPUSHn&quot; means that the stack should be extended
if necessary - it can t be necessary here, because we know
there s room for one more item on the stack, since weve just
removed one! The &quot;XPUSH*&quot; macros at least
guarantee safety.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can fiddle with the stack directly:
&quot;SP&quot; gives you the first element in your portion
of the stack, and &quot;TOP*&quot; gives you the top
SV/IV/NV/etc. on the stack. So, for instance, to do unary
negation of an integer:</p>

<p>SETi(-TOPi);</p>

<p>Just set the integer value of the top stack entry to its
negation.</p>

<p>Argument stack manipulation in the core is exactly the
same as it is in XSUBs - see perlxstut, perlxs and perlguts
for a longer description of the macros used in stack
manipulation.</p>

<p>Mark stack I say &quot;your portion of the stack&quot;
above because PP code doesnt necessarily get the whole stack
to itself: if your function calls another function, you ll
only want to expose the arguments aimed for the called
function, and not (necessarily) let it get at your own data.
The way we do this is to have a &quot;virtual&quot;
bottom-of-stack, exposed to each function. The mark stack
keeps bookmarks to locations in the argument stack usable by
each function. For instance, when dealing with a tied
variable, (internally, something with &quot;P&quot; magic)
Perl has to call methods for accesses to the tied variables.
However, we need to separate the arguments exposed to the
method to the argument exposed to the original function -
the store or fetch or whatever it may be. Heres roughly how
the tied &quot;push&quot; is implemented; see
&quot;av_push&quot; in av.c:</p>

<p>1 PUSHMARK(SP); 2 EXTEND(SP,2); 3
PUSHs(SvTIED_obj((SV*)av, mg)); 4 PUSHs(val); 5 PUTBACK; 6
ENTER; 7 call_method(&quot;PUSH&quot;, G_SCALAR|G_DISCARD);
8 LEAVE;</p>

<p>Lets examine the whole implementation, for practice:</p>

<p>1 PUSHMARK(SP);</p>

<p>Push the current state of the stack pointer onto the
mark stack. This is so that when weve finished adding items
to the argument stack, Perl knows how many things weve added
recently.</p>

<p>2 EXTEND(SP,2); 3 PUSHs(SvTIED_obj((SV*)av, mg)); 4
PUSHs(val);</p>

<p>We re going to add two more items onto the argument
stack: when you have a tied array, the &quot;PUSH&quot;
subroutine receives the object and the value to be pushed,
and thats exactly what we have here - the tied object,
retrieved with &quot;SvTIED_obj&quot;, and the value, the SV
&quot;val&quot;.</p>

<p>5 PUTBACK;</p>

<p>Next we tell Perl to update the global stack pointer
from our internal variable: &quot;dSP&quot; only gave us a
local copy, not a reference to the global.</p>

<p>6 ENTER; 7 call_method(&quot;PUSH&quot;,
G_SCALAR|G_DISCARD); 8 LEAVE;</p>

<p>&quot;ENTER&quot; and &quot;LEAVE&quot; localise a block
of code - they make sure that all variables are tidied up,
everything that has been localised gets its previous value
returned, and so on. Think of them as the &quot;{&quot; and
&quot;}&quot; of a Perl block.</p>

<p>To actually do the magic method call, we have to call a
subroutine in Perl space: &quot;call_method&quot; takes care
of that, and it s described in perlcall. We call the
&quot;PUSH&quot; method in scalar context, and were going to
discard its return value. The call_method() function removes
the top element of the mark stack, so there is nothing for
the caller to clean up.</p>

<p>Save stack C doesn t have a concept of local scope, so
perl provides one. Weve seen that &quot;ENTER&quot; and
&quot;LEAVE&quot; are used as scoping braces; the save stack
implements the C equivalent of, for example:</p>

<p>{ local $foo = 42; ... }</p>

<p>See &quot;Localising Changes&quot; in perlguts for how
to use the save stack.</p>

<p>Millions of Macros One thing youll notice about the Perl
source is that it s full of macros. Some have called the
pervasive use of macros the hardest thing to understand,
others find it adds to clarity. Let s take an example, the
code which implements the addition operator:</p>

<p>1 PP(pp_add) 2 { 3 dSP; dATARGET;
tryAMAGICbin(add,opASSIGN); 4 { 5 dPOPTOPnnrl_ul; 6 SETn(
left + right ); 7 RETURN; 8 } 9 }</p>

<p>Every line here (apart from the braces, of course)
contains a macro. The first line sets up the function
declaration as Perl expects for PP code; line 3 sets up
variable declarations for the argument stack and the target,
the return value of the operation. Finally, it tries to see
if the addition operation is overloaded; if so, the
appropriate subroutine is called.</p>

<p>Line 5 is another variable declaration - all variable
declarations start with &quot;d&quot; - which pops from the
top of the argument stack two NVs (hence &quot;nn&quot;) and
puts them into the variables &quot;right&quot; and
&quot;left&quot;, hence the &quot;rl&quot;. These are the
two operands to the addition operator. Next, we call
&quot;SETn&quot; to set the NV of the return value to the
result of adding the two values. This done, we return - the
&quot;RETURN&quot; macro makes sure that our return value is
properly handled, and we pass the next operator to run back
to the main run loop.</p>

<p>Most of these macros are explained in perlapi, and some
of the more important ones are explained in perlxs as well.
Pay special attention to &quot;Background and
PERL_IMPLICIT_CONTEXT&quot; in perlguts for information on
the &quot;[pad]THX_?&quot; macros.</p>

<p>The .i Targets You can expand the macros in a foo.c file
by saying</p>

<p>make foo.i</p>

<p>which will expand the macros using cpp. Dont be scared
by the results.</p>

<p>SOURCE CODE STATIC ANALYSIS Various tools exist for
analysing C source code statically, as opposed to
dynamically, that is, without executing the code. It is
possible to detect resource leaks, undefined behaviour, type
mismatches, portability problems, code paths that would
cause illegal memory accesses, and other similar problems by
just parsing the C code and looking at the resulting graph,
what does it tell about the execution and data flows. As a
matter of fact, this is exactly how C compilers know to give
warnings about dubious code.</p>

<p>lint, splint The good old C code quality inspector,
&quot;lint&quot;, is available in several platforms, but
please be aware that there are several different
implementations of it by different vendors, which means that
the flags are not identical across different platforms.</p>

<p>There is a lint variant called &quot;splint&quot;
(Secure Programming Lint) available from
http://www.splint.org/ that should compile on any Unix- like
platform.</p>

<p>There are &quot;lint&quot; and &lt;splint&gt; targets in
Makefile, but you may have to diddle with the flags (see
above).</p>

<p>Coverity Coverity (http://www.coverity.com/) is a
product similar to lint and as a testbed for their product
they periodically check several open source projects, and
they give out accounts to open source developers to the
defect databases.</p>

<p>cpd (cut-and-paste detector) The cpd tool detects
cut-and-paste coding. If one instance of the cut- and-pasted
code changes, all the other spots should probably be
changed, too. Therefore such code should probably be turned
into a subroutine or a macro.</p>

<p>cpd (http://pmd.sourceforge.net/cpd.html) is part of the
pmd project (http://pmd.sourceforge.net/). pmd was
originally written for static analysis of Java code, but
later the cpd part of it was extended to parse also C and
C++.</p>

<p>Download the pmd-bin-X.Y.zip () from the SourceForge
site, extract the pmd-X.Y.jar from it, and then run that on
source code thusly:</p>

<p>java -cp pmd-X.Y.jar net.sourceforge.pmd.cpd.CPD
--minimum-tokens 100 --files /some/where/src --language c
&gt; cpd.txt</p>

<p>You may run into memory limits, in which case you should
use the -Xmx option:</p>

<p>java -Xmx512M ...</p>

<p>gcc warnings Though much can be written about the
inconsistency and coverage problems of gcc warnings (like
&quot;-Wall&quot; not meaning &quot;all the warnings&quot;,
or some common portability problems not being covered by
&quot;-Wall&quot;, or &quot;-ansi&quot; and
&quot;-pedantic&quot; both being a poorly defined collection
of warnings, and so forth), gcc is still a useful tool in
keeping our coding nose clean.</p>

<p>The &quot;-Wall&quot; is by default on.</p>

<p>The &quot;-ansi&quot; (and its sidekick,
&quot;-pedantic&quot;) would be nice to be on always, but
unfortunately they are not safe on all platforms, they can
for example cause fatal conflicts with the system headers
(Solaris being a prime example). If Configure
&quot;-Dgccansipedantic&quot; is used, the
&quot;cflags&quot; frontend selects &quot;-ansi
-pedantic&quot; for the platforms where they are known to be
safe.</p>

<p>Starting from Perl 5.9.4 the following extra flags are
added:</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;-Wextra&quot;</p>

<p>The following flags would be nice to have but they would
first need their own Augean stablemaster:</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;-Wpointer-arith&quot;</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;-Wshadow&quot;</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;-Wstrict-prototypes&quot;</p>

<p>The &quot;-Wtraditional&quot; is another example of the
annoying tendency of gcc to bundle a lot of warnings under
one switch -- it would be impossible to deploy in practice
because it would complain a lot -- but it does contain some
warnings that would be beneficial to have available on their
own, such as the warning about string constants inside
macros containing the macro arguments: this behaved
differently pre-ANSI than it does in ANSI, and some C
compilers are still in transition, AIX being an example.</p>

<p>Warnings of other C compilers Other C compilers (yes,
there are other C compilers than gcc) often have their
&quot;strict ANSI&quot; or &quot;strict ANSI with some
portability extensions&quot; modes on, like for example the
Sun Workshop has its &quot;-Xa&quot; mode on (though
implicitly), or the DEC (these days, HP...) has its
&quot;-std1&quot; mode on.</p>

<p>DEBUGGING You can compile a special debugging version of
Perl, which allows you to use the &quot;-D&quot; option of
Perl to tell more about what Perl is doing. But sometimes
there is no alternative than to dive in with a debugger,
either to see the stack trace of a core dump (very useful in
a bug report), or trying to figure out what went wrong
before the core dump happened, or how did we end up having
wrong or unexpected results.</p>

<p>Poking at Perl To really poke around with Perl, youll
probably want to build Perl for debugging, like this:</p>

<p>./Configure -d -D optimize=-g make</p>

<p>&quot;-g&quot; is a flag to the C compiler to have it
produce debugging information which will allow us to step
through a running program, and to see in which C function we
are at (without the debugging information we might see only
the numerical addresses of the functions, which is not very
helpful).</p>

<p>Configure will also turn on the &quot;DEBUGGING&quot;
compilation symbol which enables all the internal debugging
code in Perl. There are a whole bunch of things you can
debug with this: perlrun lists them all, and the best way to
find out about them is to play about with them. The most
useful options are probably</p>

<p>l Context (loop) stack processing t Trace execution o
Method and overloading resolution c String/numeric
conversions</p>

<p>Some of the functionality of the debugging code can be
achieved using XS modules.</p>

<p>-Dr =&gt; use re &rsquo;debug&rsquo; -Dx =&gt; use O
&rsquo;Debug&rsquo;</p>

<p>Using a source-level debugger If the debugging output of
&quot;-D&quot; doesnt help you, its time to step through
perls execution with a source-level debugger.</p>

<p>&middot; Well use &quot;gdb&quot; for our examples here;
the principles will apply to any debugger (many vendors call
their debugger &quot;dbx&quot;), but check the manual of the
one youre using.</p>

<p>To fire up the debugger, type</p>

<p>gdb ./perl</p>

<p>Or if you have a core dump:</p>

<p>gdb ./perl core</p>

<p>Youll want to do that in your Perl source tree so the
debugger can read the source code. You should see the
copyright message, followed by the prompt.</p>

<p>(gdb)</p>

<p>&quot;help&quot; will get you into the documentation,
but here are the most useful commands:</p>

<p>run [args] Run the program with the given arguments.</p>

<p>break function_name break source.c:xxx Tells the
debugger that well want to pause execution when we reach
either the named function (but see &quot;Internal
Functions&quot; in perlguts!) or the given line in the named
source file.</p>

<p>step Steps through the program a line at a time.</p>

<p>next Steps through the program a line at a time, without
descending into functions.</p>

<p>continue Run until the next breakpoint.</p>

<p>finish Run until the end of the current function, then
stop again.</p>

<p>enter Just pressing Enter will do the most recent
operation again - its a blessing when stepping through miles
of source code.</p>

<p>print Execute the given C code and print its results.
WARNING: Perl makes heavy use of macros, and gdb does not
necessarily support macros (see later &quot;gdb macro
support&quot;). You ll have to substitute them yourself, or
to invoke cpp on the source code files (see &quot;The .i
Targets&quot;) So, for instance, you cant say</p>

<p>print SvPV_nolen(sv)</p>

<p>but you have to say</p>

<p>print Perl_sv_2pv_nolen(sv)</p>

<p>You may find it helpful to have a &quot;macro
dictionary&quot;, which you can produce by saying &quot;cpp
-dM perl.c | sort&quot;. Even then, cpp wont recursively
apply those macros for you.</p>

<p>gdb macro support Recent versions of gdb have fairly
good macro support, but in order to use it youll need to
compile perl with macro definitions included in the
debugging information. Using gcc version 3.1, this means
configuring with &quot;-Doptimize=-g3&quot;. Other compilers
might use a different switch (if they support debugging
macros at all).</p>

<p>Dumping Perl Data Structures One way to get around this
macro hell is to use the dumping functions in dump.c; these
work a little like an internal Devel::Peek, but they also
cover OPs and other structures that you cant get at from
Perl. Let s take an example. Well use the &quot;$a = $b +
$c&quot; we used before, but give it a bit of context:
&quot;$b = &quot;6XXXX&quot;; $c = 2.3;&quot;. Where s a
good place to stop and poke around?</p>

<p>What about &quot;pp_add&quot;, the function we examined
earlier to implement the &quot;+&quot; operator:</p>

<p>(gdb) break Perl_pp_add Breakpoint 1 at 0x46249f: file
pp_hot.c, line 309.</p>

<p>Notice we use &quot;Perl_pp_add&quot; and not
&quot;pp_add&quot; - see &quot;Internal Functions&quot; in
perlguts. With the breakpoint in place, we can run our
program:</p>

<p>(gdb) run -e &rsquo;$b = &quot;6XXXX&quot;; $c = 2.3; $a
= $b + $c&rsquo;</p>

<p>Lots of junk will go past as gdb reads in the relevant
source files and libraries, and then:</p>

<p>Breakpoint 1, Perl_pp_add () at pp_hot.c:309 309 dSP;
dATARGET; tryAMAGICbin(add,opASSIGN); (gdb) step 311
dPOPTOPnnrl_ul; (gdb)</p>

<p>We looked at this bit of code before, and we said that
&quot;dPOPTOPnnrl_ul&quot; arranges for two &quot;NV&quot;s
to be placed into &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; -
lets slightly expand it:</p>

<p>#define dPOPTOPnnrl_ul NV right = POPn; SV *leftsv =
TOPs; NV left = USE_LEFT(leftsv) ? SvNV(leftsv) : 0.0</p>

<p>&quot;POPn&quot; takes the SV from the top of the stack
and obtains its NV either directly (if &quot;SvNOK&quot; is
set) or by calling the &quot;sv_2nv&quot; function.
&quot;TOPs&quot; takes the next SV from the top of the stack
- yes, &quot;POPn&quot; uses &quot;TOPs&quot; - but doesnt
remove it. We then use &quot;SvNV&quot; to get the NV from
&quot;leftsv&quot; in the same way as before - yes,
&quot;POPn&quot; uses &quot;SvNV&quot;.</p>

<p>Since we dont have an NV for $b, well have to use
&quot;sv_2nv&quot; to convert it. If we step again, well
find ourselves there:</p>

<p>Perl_sv_2nv (sv=0xa0675d0) at sv.c:1669 1669 if (!sv)
(gdb)</p>

<p>We can now use &quot;Perl_sv_dump&quot; to investigate
the SV:</p>

<p>SV = PV(0xa057cc0) at 0xa0675d0 REFCNT = 1 FLAGS =
(POK,pPOK) PV = 0xa06a510 &quot;6XXXX&quot; CUR = 5 LEN = 6
$1 = void</p>

<p>We know were going to get 6 from this, so lets finish
the subroutine:</p>

<p>(gdb) finish Run till exit from #0 Perl_sv_2nv
(sv=0xa0675d0) at sv.c:1671 0x462669 in Perl_pp_add () at
pp_hot.c:311 311 dPOPTOPnnrl_ul;</p>

<p>We can also dump out this op: the current op is always
stored in &quot;PL_op&quot;, and we can dump it with
&quot;Perl_op_dump&quot;. Thisll give us similar output to
B::Debug.</p>

<p>{ 13 TYPE = add ===&gt; 14 TARG = 1 FLAGS =
(SCALAR,KIDS) { TYPE = null ===&gt; (12) (was rv2sv) FLAGS =
(SCALAR,KIDS) { 11 TYPE = gvsv ===&gt; 12 FLAGS = (SCALAR)
GV = main::b } }</p>

<p># finish this later #</p>

<p>Patching All right, weve now had a look at how to
navigate the Perl sources and some things you ll need to
know when fiddling with them. Lets now get on and create a
simple patch. Here s something Larry suggested: if a
&quot;U&quot; is the first active format during a
&quot;pack&quot;, (for example, &quot;pack &quot;U3C8&quot;,
@stuff&quot;) then the resulting string should be treated as
UTF-8 encoded.</p>

<p>How do we prepare to fix this up? First we locate the
code in question - the &quot;pack&quot; happens at runtime,
so its going to be in one of the pp files. Sure enough,
&quot;pp_pack&quot; is in pp.c. Since were going to be
altering this file, lets copy it to pp.c~.</p>

<p>[Well, it was in pp.c when this tutorial was written. It
has now been split off with &quot;pp_unpack&quot; to its own
file, pp_pack.c]</p>

<p>Now let s look over &quot;pp_pack&quot;: we take a
pattern into &quot;pat&quot;, and then loop over the
pattern, taking each format character in turn into
&quot;datum_type&quot;. Then for each possible format
character, we swallow up the other arguments in the pattern
(a field width, an asterisk, and so on) and convert the next
chunk input into the specified format, adding it onto the
output SV &quot;cat&quot;.</p>

<p>How do we know if the &quot;U&quot; is the first format
in the &quot;pat&quot;? Well, if we have a pointer to the
start of &quot;pat&quot; then, if we see a &quot;U&quot; we
can test whether were still at the start of the string. So,
here s where &quot;pat&quot; is set up:</p>

<p>STRLEN fromlen; register char *pat = SvPVx(*++MARK,
fromlen); register char *patend = pat + fromlen; register
I32 len; I32 datumtype; SV *fromstr;</p>

<p>Well have another string pointer in there:</p>

<p>STRLEN fromlen; register char *pat = SvPVx(*++MARK,
fromlen); register char *patend = pat + fromlen; + char
*patcopy; register I32 len; I32 datumtype; SV *fromstr;</p>

<p>And just before we start the loop, well set
&quot;patcopy&quot; to be the start of &quot;pat&quot;:</p>

<p>items = SP - MARK; MARK++; sv_setpvn(cat, &quot;&quot;,
0); + patcopy = pat; while (pat &lt; patend) {</p>

<p>Now if we see a &quot;U&quot; which was at the start of
the string, we turn on the &quot;UTF8&quot; flag for the
output SV, &quot;cat&quot;:</p>

<p>+ if (datumtype == &rsquo;U&rsquo; &amp;&amp;
pat==patcopy+1) + SvUTF8_on(cat); if (datumtype ==
&rsquo;#&rsquo;) { while (pat &lt; patend &amp;&amp; *pat !=
&rsquo;0) pat++;</p>

<p>Remember that it has to be &quot;patcopy+1&quot; because
the first character of the string is the &quot;U&quot; which
has been swallowed into &quot;datumtype!&quot;</p>

<p>Oops, we forgot one thing: what if there are spaces at
the start of the pattern? &quot;pack(&quot; U*&quot;,
@stuff)&quot; will have &quot;U&quot; as the first active
character, even though it s not the first thing in the
pattern. In this case, we have to advance
&quot;patcopy&quot; along with &quot;pat&quot; when we see
spaces:</p>

<p>if (isSPACE(datumtype)) continue;</p>

<p>needs to become</p>

<p>if (isSPACE(datumtype)) { patcopy++; continue; }</p>

<p>OK. That s the C part done. Now we must do two
additional things before this patch is ready to go: weve
changed the behaviour of Perl, and so we must document that
change. We must also provide some more regression tests to
make sure our patch works and doesnt create a bug somewhere
else along the line.</p>

<p>The regression tests for each operator live in t/op/,
and so we make a copy of t/op/pack.t to t/op/pack.t~. Now we
can add our tests to the end. First, we ll test that the
&quot;U&quot; does indeed create Unicode strings.</p>

<p>t/op/pack.t has a sensible ok() function, but if it didn
t we could use the one from t/test.pl.</p>

<p>require &rsquo;./test.pl&rsquo;; plan( tests =&gt; 159
);</p>

<p>so instead of this:</p>

<p>print &rsquo;not &rsquo; unless
&quot;1.20.300.4000&quot; eq sprintf &quot;%vd&quot;,
pack(&quot;U*&quot;,1,20,300,4000); print &quot;ok $test0;
$test++;</p>

<p>we can write the more sensible (see Test::More for a
full explanation of is() and other testing functions).</p>

<p>is( &quot;1.20.300.4000&quot;, sprintf &quot;%vd&quot;,
pack(&quot;U*&quot;,1,20,300,4000), &quot;U* produces
Unicode&quot; );</p>

<p>Now we ll test that we got that space-at-the-beginning
business right:</p>

<p>is( &quot;1.20.300.4000&quot;, sprintf &quot;%vd&quot;,
pack(&quot; U*&quot;,1,20,300,4000), &quot; with spaces at
the beginning&quot; );</p>

<p>And finally well test that we dont make Unicode strings
if &quot;U&quot; is not the first active format:</p>

<p>isnt( v1.20.300.4000, sprintf &quot;%vd&quot;,
pack(&quot;C0U*&quot;,1,20,300,4000), &quot;U* not first
isn&rsquo;t Unicode&quot; );</p>

<p>Mustn t forget to change the number of tests which
appears at the top, or else the automated tester will get
confused. This will either look like this:</p>

<p>print &quot;1..1560;</p>

<p>or this:</p>

<p>plan( tests =&gt; 156 );</p>

<p>We now compile up Perl, and run it through the test
suite. Our new tests pass, hooray!</p>

<p>Finally, the documentation. The job is never done until
the paperwork is over, so lets describe the change weve just
made. The relevant place is pod/perlfunc.pod; again, we make
a copy, and then well insert this text in the description of
&quot;pack&quot;:</p>

<p>=item *</p>

<p>If the pattern begins with a C&lt;U&gt;, the resulting
string will be treated as UTF-8-encoded Unicode. You can
force UTF-8 encoding on in a string with an initial
C&lt;U0&gt;, and the bytes that follow will be interpreted
as Unicode characters. If you don&rsquo;t want this to
happen, you can begin your pattern with C&lt;C0&gt; (or
anything else) to force Perl not to UTF-8 encode your
string, and then follow this with a C&lt;U*&gt; somewhere in
your pattern.</p>

<p>All done. Now lets create the patch.
Porting/patching.pod tells us that if were making major
changes, we should copy the entire directory to somewhere
safe before we begin fiddling, and then do</p>

<p>diff -ruN old new &gt; patch</p>

<p>However, we know which files weve changed, and we can
simply do this:</p>

<p>diff -u pp.c~ pp.c &gt; patch diff -u t/op/pack.t~
t/op/pack.t &gt;&gt; patch diff -u pod/perlfunc.pod~
pod/perlfunc.pod &gt;&gt; patch</p>

<p>We end up with a patch looking a little like this:</p>

<p>And finally, we submit it, with our rationale, to

<p>Patching a core module This works just like patching
anything else, with an extra consideration. Many core
modules also live on CPAN. If this is so, patch the CPAN
version instead of the core and send the patch off to the
module maintainer (with a copy to p5p). This will help the
module maintainer keep the CPAN version in sync with the
core version without constantly scanning p5p.</p>

<p>The list of maintainers of core modules is usefully
documented in Porting/Maintainers.pl.</p>

<p>Adding a new function to the core If, as part of a patch
to fix a bug, or just because you have an especially good
idea, you decide to add a new function to the core, discuss
your ideas on p5p well before you start work. It may be that
someone else has already attempted to do what you are
considering and can give lots of good advice or even provide
you with bits of code that they already started (but never
finished).</p>

<p>You have to follow all of the advice given above for
patching. It is extremely important to test any addition
thoroughly and add new tests to explore all boundary
conditions that your new function is expected to handle. If
your new function is used only by one module (e.g. toke),
then it should probably be named S_your_function (for
static); on the other hand, if you expect it to accessible
from other functions in Perl, you should name it
Perl_your_function. See &quot;Internal Functions&quot; in
perlguts for more details.</p>

<p>The location of any new code is also an important
consideration. Dont just create a new top level .c file and
put your code there; you would have to make changes to
Configure (so the Makefile is created properly), as well as
possibly lots of include files. This is strictly pumpking
business.</p>

<p>It is better to add your function to one of the existing
top level source code files, but your choice is complicated
by the nature of the Perl distribution. Only the files that
are marked as compiled static are located in the perl
executable. Everything else is located in the shared library
(or DLL if you are running under WIN32). So, for example, if
a function was only used by functions located in toke.c,
then your code can go in toke.c. If, however, you want to
call the function from universal.c, then you should put your
code in another location, for example util.c.</p>

<p>In addition to writing your c-code, you will need to
create an appropriate entry in embed.pl describing your
function, then run make regen_headers to create the entries
in the numerous header files that perl needs to compile
correctly. See &quot;Internal Functions&quot; in perlguts
for information on the various options that you can set in
embed.pl. You will forget to do this a few (or many) times
and you will get warnings during the compilation phase. Make
sure that you mention this when you post your patch to P5P;
the pumpking needs to know this.</p>

<p>When you write your new code, please be conscious of
existing code conventions used in the perl source files. See
perlstyle for details. Although most of the guidelines
discussed seem to focus on Perl code, rather than c, they
all apply (except when they don t ;). See also
Porting/patching.pod file in the Perl source distribution
for lots of details about both formatting and submitting
patches of your changes.</p>

<p>Lastly, TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST any code before posting
to p5p. Test on as many platforms as you can find. Test as
many perl Configure options as you can (e.g. MULTIPLICITY).
If you have profiling or memory tools, see &quot;EXTERNAL
TOOLS FOR DEBUGGING PERL&quot; below for how to use them to
further test your code. Remember that most of the people on
P5P are doing this on their own time and dont have the time
to debug your code.</p>

<p>Writing a test Every module and built-in function has an
associated test file (or should...). If you add or change
functionality, you have to write a test. If you fix a bug,
you have to write a test so that bug never comes back. If
you alter the docs, it would be nice to test what the new
documentation says.</p>

<p>In short, if you submit a patch you probably also have
to patch the tests.</p>

<p>For modules, the test file is right next to the module
itself. lib/strict.t tests lib/strict.pm. This is a recent
innovation, so there are some snags (and it would be
wonderful for you to brush them out), but it basically works
that way. Everything else lives in t/.</p>

<p>If you add a new test directory under t/, it is
imperative that you add that directory to t/HARNESS and
t/TEST.</p>

<p>t/base/ Testing of the absolute basic functionality of
Perl. Things like &quot;if&quot;, basic file reads and
writes, simple regexes, etc. These are run first in the test
suite and if any of them fail, something is really
broken.</p>

<p>t/cmd/ These test the basic control structures,
&quot;if/else&quot;, &quot;while&quot;, subroutines,
etc.</p>

<p>t/comp/ Tests basic issues of how Perl parses and
compiles itself.</p>

<p>t/io/ Tests for built-in IO functions, including command
line arguments.</p>

<p>t/lib/ The old home for the module tests, you shouldnt
put anything new in here. There are still some bits and
pieces hanging around in here that need to be moved. Perhaps
you could move them? Thanks!</p>

<p>t/mro/ Tests for perls method resolution order
implementations (see mro).</p>

<p>t/op/ Tests for perls built in functions that dont fit
into any of the other directories.</p>

<p>t/pod/ Tests for POD directives. There are still some
tests for the Pod modules hanging around in here that need
to be moved out into lib/.</p>

<p>t/run/ Testing features of how perl actually runs,
including exit codes and handling of PERL* environment
variables.</p>

<p>t/uni/ Tests for the core support of Unicode.</p>

<p>t/win32/ Windows-specific tests.</p>

<p>t/x2p A test suite for the s2p converter.</p>

<p>The core uses the same testing style as the rest of
Perl, a simple &quot;ok/not ok&quot; run through
Test::Harness, but there are a few special
considerations.</p>

<p>There are three ways to write a test in the core.
Test::More, t/test.pl and ad hoc &quot;print $test ?
&quot;ok 420 : &quot;not ok 420&quot;. The decision of which
to use depends on what part of the test suite youre working
on. This is a measure to prevent a high-level failure (such
as Config.pm breaking) from causing basic functionality
tests to fail.</p>

<p>t/base t/comp Since we don t know if require works, or
even subroutines, use ad hoc tests for these two. Step
carefully to avoid using the feature being tested.</p>

<p>t/cmd t/run t/io t/op Now that basic require() and
subroutines are tested, you can use the t/test.pl library
which emulates the important features of Test::More while
using a minimum of core features.</p>

<p>You can also conditionally use certain libraries like
Config, but be sure to skip the test gracefully if its not
there.</p>

<p>t/lib ext lib Now that the core of Perl is tested,
Test::More can be used. You can also use the full suite of
core modules in the tests.</p>

<p>When you say &quot;make test&quot; Perl uses the t/TEST
program to run the test suite (except under Win32 where it
uses t/harness instead.) All tests are run from the t/
directory, not the directory which contains the test. This
causes some problems with the tests in lib/, so heres some
opportunity for some patching.</p>

<p>You must be triply conscious of cross-platform concerns.
This usually boils down to using File::Spec and avoiding
things like &quot;fork()&quot; and &quot;system()&quot;
unless absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>Special Make Test Targets There are various special make
targets that can be used to test Perl slightly differently
than the standard &quot;test&quot; target. Not all them are
expected to give a 100% success rate. Many of them have
several aliases, and many of them are not available on
certain operating systems.</p>

<p>coretest Run perl on all core tests (t/* and lib/[a-z]*
pragma tests).</p>

<p>(Not available on Win32)</p>

<p>test.deparse Run all the tests through B::Deparse. Not
all tests will succeed.</p>

<p>(Not available on Win32)</p>

<p>test.taintwarn Run all tests with the -t command-line
switch. Not all tests are expected to succeed (until theyre
specifically fixed, of course).</p>

<p>(Not available on Win32)</p>

<p>minitest Run miniperl on t/base, t/comp, t/cmd, t/run,
t/io, t/op, t/uni and t/mro tests.</p>

<p>test.valgrind check.valgrind utest.valgrind
ucheck.valgrind (Only in Linux) Run all the tests using the
memory leak + naughty memory access tool
&quot;valgrind&quot;. The log files will be named
testname.valgrind.</p>

<p>test.third check.third utest.third ucheck.third (Only in
Tru64) Run all the tests using the memory leak + naughty
memory access tool &quot;Third Degree&quot;. The log files
will be named perl.3log.testname.</p>

<p>test.torture torturetest Run all the usual tests and
some extra tests. As of Perl 5.8.0 the only extra tests are
Abigails JAPHs, t/japh/abigail.t.</p>

<p>You can also run the torture test with t/harness by
giving &quot;-torture&quot; argument to t/harness.</p>

<p>utest ucheck test.utf8 check.utf8 Run all the tests with
-Mutf8. Not all tests will succeed.</p>

<p>(Not available on Win32)</p>

<p>minitest.utf16 test.utf16 Runs the tests with UTF-16
encoded scripts, encoded with different versions of this
encoding.</p>

<p>&quot;make utest.utf16&quot; runs the test suite with a
combination of &quot;-utf8&quot; and &quot;-utf16&quot;
arguments to t/TEST.</p>

<p>(Not available on Win32)</p>

<p>test_harness Run the test suite with the t/harness
controlling program, instead of t/TEST. t/harness is more
sophisticated, and uses the Test::Harness module, thus using
this test target supposes that perl mostly works. The main
advantage for our purposes is that it prints a detailed
summary of failed tests at the end. Also, unlike t/TEST, it
doesnt redirect stderr to stdout.</p>

<p>Note that under Win32 t/harness is always used instead
of t/TEST, so there is no special &quot;test_harness&quot;
target.</p>

<p>Under Win32 s &quot;test&quot; target you may use the
TEST_SWITCHES and TEST_FILES environment variables to
control the behaviour of t/harness. This means you can
say</p>

<p>nmake test TEST_FILES=&quot;op/*.t&quot; nmake test
TEST_SWITCHES=&quot;-torture&quot;
TEST_FILES=&quot;op/*.t&quot;</p>

<p>test-notty test_notty Sets PERL_SKIP_TTY_TEST to true
before running normal test.</p>

<p>Running tests by hand You can run part of the test suite
by hand by using one the following commands from the t/
directory :</p>

<p>./perl -I../lib TEST list-of-.t-files</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>./perl -I../lib harness list-of-.t-files</p>

<p>(if you don t specify test scripts, the whole test suite
will be run.)</p>

<p>Using t/harness for testing</p>

<p>If you use &quot;harness&quot; for testing you have
several command line options available to you. The arguments
are as follows, and are in the order that they must appear
if used together.</p>

<p>harness -v -torture -re=pattern LIST OF FILES TO TEST
harness -v -torture -re LIST OF PATTERNS TO MATCH</p>

<p>If &quot;LIST OF FILES TO TEST&quot; is omitted the file
list is obtained from the manifest. The file list may
include shell wildcards which will be expanded out.</p>

<p>-v Run the tests under verbose mode so you can see what
tests were run, and debug output.</p>

<p>-torture Run the torture tests as well as the normal
set.</p>

<p>-re=PATTERN Filter the file list so that all the test
files run match PATTERN. Note that this form is distinct
from the -re LIST OF PATTERNS form below in that it allows
the file list to be provided as well.</p>

<p>-re LIST OF PATTERNS Filter the file list so that all
the test files run match /(LIST|OF|PATTERNS)/. Note that
with this form the patterns are joined by | and you cannot
supply a list of files, instead the test files are obtained
from the MANIFEST.</p>

<p>You can run an individual test by a command similar
to</p>

<p>./perl -I../lib patho/to/foo.t</p>

<p>except that the harnesses set up some environment
variables that may affect the execution of the test :</p>

<p>PERL_CORE=1 indicates that were running this test part
of the perl core test suite. This is useful for modules that
have a dual life on CPAN.</p>

<p>PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL=2 is set to 2 if it isn t set
already (see &quot;PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL&quot;)</p>

<p>PERL (used only by t/TEST) if set, overrides the path to
the perl executable that should be used to run the tests
(the default being ./perl).</p>

<p>PERL_SKIP_TTY_TEST if set, tells to skip the tests that
need a terminal. Its actually set automatically by the
Makefile, but can also be forced artificially by running
make test_notty.</p>

<p>Other environment variables that may influence tests</p>

<p>PERL_TEST_Net_Ping Setting this variable runs all the
Net::Ping modules tests, otherwise some tests that interact
with the outside world are skipped. See perl58delta.</p>

<p>PERL_TEST_NOVREXX Setting this variable skips the
vrexx.t tests for OS2::REXX.</p>

<p>PERL_TEST_NUMCONVERTS This sets a variable in
op/numconvert.t.</p>

<p>See also the documentation for the Test and
Test::Harness modules, for more environment variables that
affect testing.</p>

<p>Common problems when patching Perl source code Perl
source plays by ANSI C89 rules: no C99 (or C++) extensions.
In some cases we have to take pre-ANSI requirements into
consideration. You dont care about some particular platform
having broken Perl? I hear there is still a strong demand
for J2EE programmers.</p>

<p>Perl environment problems &middot; Not compiling with
threading</p>

<p>Compiling with threading (-Duseithreads) completely
rewrites the function prototypes of Perl. You better try
your changes with that. Related to this is the difference
between &quot;Perl_-less&quot; and &quot;Perl_-ly&quot;
APIs, for example:</p>

<p>Perl_sv_setiv(aTHX_ ...); sv_setiv(...);</p>

<p>The first one explicitly passes in the context, which is
needed for e.g. threaded builds. The second one does that
implicitly; do not get them mixed. If you are not passing in
a aTHX_, you will need to do a dTHX (or a dVAR) as the first
thing in the function.</p>

<p>See &quot;How multiple interpreters and concurrency are
supported&quot; in perlguts for further discussion about
context.</p>

<p>&middot; Not compiling with -DDEBUGGING</p>

<p>The DEBUGGING define exposes more code to the compiler,
therefore more ways for things to go wrong. You should try
it.</p>

<p>&middot; Introducing (non-read-only) globals</p>

<p>Do not introduce any modifiable globals, truly global or
file static. They are bad form and complicate multithreading
and other forms of concurrency. The right way is to
introduce them as new interpreter variables, see intrpvar.h
(at the very end for binary compatibility).</p>

<p>Introducing read-only (const) globals is okay, as long
as you verify with e.g. &quot;nm libperl.a|egrep -v &rsquo;
[TURtr] &rsquo;&quot; (if your &quot;nm&quot; has BSD-style
output) that the data you added really is read-only. (If it
is, it shouldnt show up in the output of that command.)</p>

<p>If you want to have static strings, make them
constant:</p>

<p>static const char etc[] = &quot;...&quot;;</p>

<p>If you want to have arrays of constant strings, note
carefully the right combination of &quot;const&quot;s:</p>

<p>static const char * const yippee[] = {&quot;hi&quot;,
&quot;ho&quot;, &quot;silver&quot;};</p>

<p>There is a way to completely hide any modifiable globals
(they are all moved to heap), the compilation setting
&quot;-DPERL_GLOBAL_STRUCT_PRIVATE&quot;. It is not normally
used, but can be used for testing, read more about it in
&quot;Background and PERL_IMPLICIT_CONTEXT&quot; in
perlguts.</p>

<p>&middot; Not exporting your new function</p>

<p>Some platforms (Win32, AIX, VMS, OS/2, to name a few)
require any function that is part of the public API (the
shared Perl library) to be explicitly marked as exported.
See the discussion about embed.pl in perlguts.</p>

<p>&middot; Exporting your new function</p>

<p>The new shiny result of either genuine new functionality
or your arduous refactoring is now ready and correctly
exported. So what could possibly go wrong?</p>

<p>Maybe simply that your function did not need to be
exported in the first place. Perl has a long and not so
glorious history of exporting functions that it should not
have.</p>

<p>If the function is used only inside one source code
file, make it static. See the discussion about embed.pl in
perlguts.</p>

<p>If the function is used across several files, but
intended only for Perls internal use (and this should be the
common case), do not export it to the public API. See the
discussion about embed.pl in perlguts.</p>

<p>Portability problems The following are common causes of
compilation and/or execution failures, not common to Perl as
such. The C FAQ is good bedtime reading. Please test your
changes with as many C compilers and platforms as possible
-- we will, anyway, and its nice to save oneself from public
embarrassment.</p>

<p>If using gcc, you can add the &quot;-std=c89&quot;
option which will hopefully catch most of these
unportabilities. (However it might also catch
incompatibilities in your systems header files.)</p>

<p>Use the Configure &quot;-Dgccansipedantic&quot; flag to
enable the gcc &quot;-ansi -pedantic&quot; flags which
enforce stricter ANSI rules.</p>

<p>If using the &quot;gcc -Wall&quot; note that not all the
possible warnings (like &quot;-Wunitialized&quot;) are given
unless you also compile with &quot;-O&quot;.</p>

<p>Note that if using gcc, starting from Perl 5.9.5 the
Perl core source code files (the ones at the top level of
the source code distribution, but not e.g. the extensions
under ext/) are automatically compiled with as many as
possible of the &quot;-std=c89&quot;, &quot;-ansi&quot;,
&quot;-pedantic&quot;, and a selection of &quot;-W&quot;
flags (see cflags.SH).</p>

<p>Also study perlport carefully to avoid any bad
assumptions about the operating system, filesystems, and so
forth.</p>

<p>You may once in a while try a &quot;make microperl&quot;
to see whether we can still compile Perl with just the bare
minimum of interfaces. (See README.micro.)</p>

<p>Do not assume an operating system indicates a certain
compiler.</p>

<p>&middot; Casting pointers to integers or casting
integers to pointers</p>

<p>void castaway(U8* p) { IV i = p;</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>void castaway(U8* p) { IV i = (IV)p;</p>

<p>Both are bad, and broken, and unportable. Use the
PTR2IV() macro that does it right. (Likewise, there are
PTR2UV(), PTR2NV(), INT2PTR(), and NUM2PTR().)</p>

<p>&middot; Casting between data function pointers and data
pointers</p>

<p>Technically speaking casting between function pointers
and data pointers is unportable and undefined, but
practically speaking it seems to work, but you should use
the FPTR2DPTR() and DPTR2FPTR() macros. Sometimes you can
also play games with unions.</p>

<p>&middot; Assuming sizeof(int) == sizeof(long)</p>

<p>There are platforms where longs are 64 bits, and
platforms where ints are 64 bits, and while we are out to
shock you, even platforms where shorts are 64 bits. This is
all legal according to the C standard. (In other words,
&quot;long long&quot; is not a portable way to specify 64
bits, and &quot;long long&quot; is not even guaranteed to be
any wider than &quot;long&quot;.)</p>

<p>Instead, use the definitions IV, UV, IVSIZE, I32SIZE,
and so forth. Avoid things like I32 because they are not
guaranteed to be exactly 32 bits, they are at least 32 bits,
nor are they guaranteed to be int or long. If you really
explicitly need 64-bit variables, use I64 and U64, but only
if guarded by HAS_QUAD.</p>

<p>&middot; Assuming one can dereference any type of
pointer for any type of data</p>

<p>char *p = ...; long pony = *p; /* BAD */</p>

<p>Many platforms, quite rightly so, will give you a core
dump instead of a pony if the p happens not be correctly
aligned.</p>

<p>&middot; Lvalue casts</p>

<p>(int)*p = ...; /* BAD */</p>

<p>Simply not portable. Get your lvalue to be of the right
type, or maybe use temporary variables, or dirty tricks with
unions.</p>

<p>&middot; Assume anything about structs (especially the
ones you dont control, like the ones coming from the system
headers)</p>

<p>&middot; That a certain field exists in a struct</p>

<p>&middot; That no other fields exist besides the ones you
know of</p>

<p>&middot; That a field is of certain signedness, sizeof,
or type</p>

<p>&middot; That the fields are in a certain order</p>

<p>&middot; While C guarantees the ordering specified in
the struct definition, between different platforms the
definitions might differ</p>

<p>&middot; That the sizeof(struct) or the alignments are
the same everywhere</p>

<p>&middot; There might be padding bytes between the fields
to align the fields - the bytes can be anything</p>

<p>&middot; Structs are required to be aligned to the
maximum alignment required by the fields - which for native
types is for usually equivalent to sizeof() of the field</p>

<p>&middot; Assuming the character set is ASCIIish</p>

<p>Perl can compile and run under EBCDIC platforms. See
perlebcdic. This is transparent for the most part, but
because the character sets differ, you shouldnt use numeric
(decimal, octal, nor hex) constants to refer to characters.
You can safely say A, but not , but not 12. If a character
0x41. You can safely say 0 doesn t have a trivial input
form, you can create a #define for it in both
&quot;utfebcdic.h&quot; and &quot;utf8.h&quot;, so that it
resolves to different values depending on the character set
being used. (There are three different EBCDIC character sets
defined in &quot;utfebcdic.h&quot;, so it might be best to
insert the #define three times in that file.)</p>

<p>Also, the range A - Z in ASCII is an unbroken sequence
of 26 upper case alphabetic characters. That is not true in
EBCDIC. Nor for a to z. But 0 - 9 is an unbroken range in
both systems. Dont assume anything about other ranges.</p>

<p>Many of the comments in the existing code ignore the
possibility of EBCDIC, and may be wrong therefore, even if
the code works. This is actually a tribute to the successful
transparent insertion of being able to handle EBCDIC without
having to change pre-existing code.</p>

<p>UTF-8 and UTF-EBCDIC are two different encodings used to
represent Unicode code points as sequences of bytes. Macros
with the same names (but different definitions) in
&quot;utf8.h&quot; and &quot;utfebcdic.h&quot; are used to
allow the calling code to think that there is only one such
encoding. This is almost always referred to as
&quot;utf8&quot;, but it means the EBCDIC version as well.
Again, comments in the code may well be wrong even if the
code itself is right. For example, the concept of
&quot;invariant characters&quot; differs between ASCII and
EBCDIC. On ASCII platforms, only characters that do not have
the high-order bit set (i.e. whose ordinals are strict
ASCII, 0 - 127) are invariant, and the documentation and
comments in the code may assume that, often referring to
something like, say, &quot;hibit&quot;. The situation
differs and is not so simple on EBCDIC machines, but as long
as the code itself uses the
&quot;NATIVE_IS_INVARIANT()&quot; macro appropriately, it
works, even if the comments are wrong.</p>

<p>&middot; Assuming the character set is just ASCII</p>

<p>ASCII is a 7 bit encoding, but bytes have 8 bits in
them. The 128 extra characters have different meanings
depending on the locale. Absent a locale, currently these
extra characters are generally considered to be unassigned,
and this has presented some problems. This is scheduled to
be changed in 5.12 so that these characters will be
considered to be Latin-1 (ISO-8859-1).</p>

<p>&middot; Mixing #define and #ifdef</p>

<p>#define BURGLE(x) ... #ifdef BURGLE_OLD_STYLE /* BAD */
... do it the old way ... #else ... do it the new way ...
#endif</p>

<p>You cannot portably &quot;stack&quot; cpp directives.
For example in the above you need two separate BURGLE()
#defines, one for each #ifdef branch.</p>

<p>&middot; Adding non-comment stuff after #endif or
#else</p>

<p>#ifdef SNOSH ... #else !SNOSH /* BAD */ ... #endif SNOSH
/* BAD */</p>

<p>The #endif and #else cannot portably have anything
non-comment after them. If you want to document what is
going (which is a good idea especially if the branches are
long), use (C) comments:</p>

<p>#ifdef SNOSH ... #else /* !SNOSH */ ... #endif /* SNOSH
*/</p>

<p>The gcc option &quot;-Wendif-labels&quot; warns about
the bad variant (by default on starting from Perl
5.9.4).</p>

<p>&middot; Having a comma after the last element of an
enum list</p>

<p>enum color { CERULEAN, CHARTREUSE, CINNABAR, /* BAD */
};</p>

<p>is not portable. Leave out the last comma.</p>

<p>Also note that whether enums are implicitly morphable to
ints varies between compilers, you might need to (int).</p>

<p>&middot; Using //-comments</p>

<p>// This function bamfoodles the zorklator. /* BAD */</p>

<p>That is C99 or C++. Perl is C89. Using the //-comments
is silently allowed by many C compilers but cranking up the
ANSI C89 strictness (which we like to do) causes the
compilation to fail.</p>

<p>&middot; Mixing declarations and code</p>

<p>void zorklator() { int n = 3; set_zorkmids(n); /* BAD */
int q = 4;</p>

<p>That is C99 or C++. Some C compilers allow that, but you
shouldnt.</p>

<p>The gcc option
&quot;-Wdeclaration-after-statements&quot; scans for such
problems (by default on starting from Perl 5.9.4).</p>

<p>&middot; Introducing variables inside for()</p>

<p>for(int i = ...; ...; ...) { /* BAD */</p>

<p>That is C99 or C++. While it would indeed be awfully
nice to have that also in C89, to limit the scope of the
loop variable, alas, we cannot.</p>

<p>&middot; Mixing signed char pointers with unsigned char
pointers</p>

<p>int foo(char *s) { ... } ... unsigned char *t = ...; /*
Or U8* t = ... */ foo(t); /* BAD */</p>

<p>While this is legal practice, it is certainly dubious,
and downright fatal in at least one platform: for example
VMS cc considers this a fatal error. One cause for people
often making this mistake is that a &quot;naked char&quot;
and therefore dereferencing a &quot;naked char pointer&quot;
have an undefined signedness: it depends on the compiler and
the flags of the compiler and the underlying platform
whether the result is signed or unsigned. For this very same
reason using a char as an array index is bad.</p>

<p>&middot; Macros that have string constants and their
arguments as substrings of the string constants</p>

<p>#define FOO(n) printf(&quot;number = %d0, n) /* BAD */
FOO(10);</p>

<p>Pre-ANSI semantics for that was equivalent to</p>

<p>printf(&quot;10umber = %d10&quot;);</p>

<p>which is probably not what you were expecting.
Unfortunately at least one reasonably common and modern C
compiler does &quot;real backward compatibility&quot; here,
in AIX that is what still happens even though the rest of
the AIX compiler is very happily C89.</p>

<p>&middot; Using printf formats for non-basic C types</p>

<p>IV i = ...; printf(&quot;i = %d0, i); /* BAD */</p>

<p>While this might by accident work in some platform
(where IV happens to be an &quot;int&quot;), in general it
cannot. IV might be something larger. Even worse the
situation is with more specific types (defined by Perl s
configuration step in config.h):</p>

<p>Uid_t who = ...; printf(&quot;who = %d0, who); /* BAD
*/</p>

<p>The problem here is that Uid_t might be not only not
&quot;int&quot;-wide but it might also be unsigned, in which
case large uids would be printed as negative values.</p>

<p>There is no simple solution to this because of printf()s
limited intelligence, but for many types the right format is
available as with either f or _f suffix, for example:</p>

<p>IVdf /* IV in decimal */ UVxf /* UV is hexadecimal
*/</p>

<p>printf(&quot;i = %&quot;IVdf&quot;0, i); /* The IVdf is
a string constant. */</p>

<p>Uid_t_f /* Uid_t in decimal */</p>

<p>printf(&quot;who = %&quot;Uid_t_f&quot;0, who);</p>

<p>Or you can try casting to a &quot;wide enough&quot;
type:</p>

<p>printf(&quot;i = %&quot;IVdf&quot;0,
(IV)something_very_small_and_signed);</p>

<p>Also remember that the %p format really does require a
void pointer:</p>

<p>U8* p = ...; printf(&quot;p = %p0, (void*)p);</p>

<p>The gcc option &quot;-Wformat&quot; scans for such
problems.</p>

<p>&middot; Blindly using variadic macros</p>

<p>gcc has had them for a while with its own syntax, and
C99 brought them with a standardized syntax. Dont use the
former, and use the latter only if the
HAS_C99_VARIADIC_MACROS is defined.</p>

<p>&middot; Blindly passing va_list</p>

<p>Not all platforms support passing va_list to further
varargs (stdarg) functions. The right thing to do is to copy
the va_list using the Perl_va_copy() if the NEED_VA_COPY is
defined.</p>

<p>&middot; Using gcc statement expressions</p>

<p>val = ({...;...;...}); /* BAD */</p>

<p>While a nice extension, its not portable. The Perl code
does admittedly use them if available to gain some extra
speed (essentially as a funky form of inlining), but you
shouldnt.</p>

<p>&middot; Binding together several statements in a
macro</p>

<p>Use the macros STMT_START and STMT_END.</p>

<p>STMT_START { ... } STMT_END</p>

<p>&middot; Testing for operating systems or versions when
should be testing for features</p>

<p>#ifdef __FOONIX__ /* BAD */ foo = quux(); #endif</p>

<p>Unless you know with 100% certainty that quux() is only
ever available for the &quot;Foonix&quot; operating system
and that is available and correctly working for all past,
present, and future versions of &quot;Foonix&quot;, the
above is very wrong. This is more correct (though still not
perfect, because the below is a compile-time check):</p>

<p>#ifdef HAS_QUUX foo = quux(); #endif</p>

<p>How does the HAS_QUUX become defined where it needs to
be? Well, if Foonix happens to be UNIXy enough to be able to
run the Configure script, and Configure has been taught
about detecting and testing quux(), the HAS_QUUX will be
correctly defined. In other platforms, the corresponding
configuration step will hopefully do the same.</p>

<p>In a pinch, if you cannot wait for Configure to be
educated, or if you have a good hunch of where quux() might
be available, you can temporarily try the following:</p>

<p>#if (defined(__FOONIX__) || defined(__BARNIX__)) #
define HAS_QUUX #endif</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>#ifdef HAS_QUUX foo = quux(); #endif</p>

<p>But in any case, try to keep the features and operating
systems separate.</p>

<p>Problematic System Interfaces &middot; malloc(0),
realloc(0), calloc(0, 0) are non-portable. To be portable
allocate at least one byte. (In general you should rarely
need to work at this low level, but instead use the various
malloc wrappers.)</p>

<p>&middot; snprintf() - the return type is unportable. Use
my_snprintf() instead.</p>

<p>Security problems Last but not least, here are various
tips for safer coding.</p>

<p>&middot; Do not use gets()</p>

<p>Or we will publicly ridicule you. Seriously.</p>

<p>&middot; Do not use strcpy() or strcat() or strncpy() or
strncat()</p>

<p>Use my_strlcpy() and my_strlcat() instead: they either
use the native implementation, or Perl s own implementation
(borrowed from the public domain implementation of INN).</p>

<p>&middot; Do not use sprintf() or vsprintf()</p>

<p>If you really want just plain byte strings, use
my_snprintf() and my_vsnprintf() instead, which will try to
use snprintf() and vsnprintf() if those safer APIs are
available. If you want something fancier than a plain byte
string, use SVs and Perl_sv_catpvf().</p>

<p>EXTERNAL TOOLS FOR DEBUGGING PERL Sometimes it helps to
use external tools while debugging and testing Perl. This
section tries to guide you through using some common testing
and debugging tools with Perl. This is meant as a guide to
interfacing these tools with Perl, not as any kind of guide
to the use of the tools themselves.</p>

<p>NOTE 1: Running under memory debuggers such as Purify,
valgrind, or Third Degree greatly slows down the execution:
seconds become minutes, minutes become hours. For example as
of Perl 5.8.1, the ext/Encode/t/Unicode.t takes
extraordinarily long to complete under e.g. Purify, Third
Degree, and valgrind. Under valgrind it takes more than six
hours, even on a snappy computer-- the said test must be
doing something that is quite unfriendly for memory
debuggers. If you dont feel like waiting, that you can
simply kill away the perl process.</p>

<p>NOTE 2: To minimize the number of memory leak false
alarms (see &quot;PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL&quot; for more
information), you have to have environment variable
PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL set to 2. The TEST and harness scripts
do that automatically. But if you are running some of the
tests manually-- for csh-like shells:</p>

<p>setenv PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL 2</p>

<p>and for Bourne-type shells:</p>

<p>PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL=2 export PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL</p>

<p>or in UNIXy environments you can also use the
&quot;env&quot; command:</p>

<p>env PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL=2 valgrind ./perl -Ilib ...</p>

<p>NOTE 3: There are known memory leaks when there are
compile-time errors within eval or require, seeing
&quot;S_doeval&quot; in the call stack is a good sign of
these. Fixing these leaks is non-trivial, unfortunately, but
they must be fixed eventually.</p>

<p>NOTE 4: DynaLoader will not clean up after itself
completely unless Perl is built with the Configure option
&quot;-Accflags=-DDL_UNLOAD_ALL_AT_EXIT&quot;.</p>

<p>Rational Softwars Purify Purify is a commercial tool
that is helpful in identifying memory overruns, wild
pointers, memory leaks and other such badness. Perl must be
compiled in a specific way for optimal testing with Purify.
Purify is available under Windows NT, Solaris, HP-UX, SGI,
and Siemens Unix.</p>

<p>Purify on Unix On Unix, Purify creates a new Perl
binary. To get the most benefit out of Purify, you should
create the perl to Purify using:</p>

<p>sh Configure -Accflags=-DPURIFY
-Doptimize=&rsquo;-g&rsquo; -Uusemymalloc
-Dusemultiplicity</p>

<p>where these arguments mean:</p>

<p>-Accflags=-DPURIFY Disables Perl s arena memory
allocation functions, as well as forcing use of memory
allocation functions derived from the system malloc.</p>

<p>-Doptimize=-g Adds debugging information so that you see
the exact source statements where the problem occurs.
Without this flag, all you will see is the source filename
of where the error occurred.</p>

<p>-Uusemymalloc Disable Perls malloc so that Purify can
more closely monitor allocations and leaks. Using Perls
malloc will make Purify report most leaks in the
&quot;potential&quot; leaks category.</p>

<p>-Dusemultiplicity Enabling the multiplicity option
allows perl to clean up thoroughly when the interpreter
shuts down, which reduces the number of bogus leak reports
from Purify.</p>

<p>Once youve compiled a perl suitable for Purify ing, then
you can just:</p>

<p>make pureperl</p>

<p>which creates a binary named pureperl that has been
Purify ed. This binary is used in place of the standard perl
binary when you want to debug Perl memory problems.</p>

<p>As an example, to show any memory leaks produced during
the standard Perl testset you would create and run the
Purify ed perl as:</p>

<p>make pureperl cd t ../pureperl -I../lib harness</p>

<p>which would run Perl on test.pl and report any memory
problems.</p>

<p>Purify outputs messages in &quot;Viewer&quot; windows by
default. If you dont have a windowing environment or if you
simply want the Purify output to unobtrusively go to a log
file instead of to the interactive window, use these
following options to output to the log file
&quot;perl.log&quot;:</p>

<p>setenv PURIFYOPTIONS &quot;-chain-length=25 -windows=no
-log-file=perl.log -append-logfile=yes&quot;</p>

<p>If you plan to use the &quot;Viewer&quot; windows, then
you only need this option:</p>

<p>setenv PURIFYOPTIONS &quot;-chain-length=25&quot;</p>

<p>In Bourne-type shells:</p>

<p>PURIFYOPTIONS=&quot;...&quot; export PURIFYOPTIONS</p>

<p>or if you have the &quot;env&quot; utility:</p>

<p>env PURIFYOPTIONS=&quot;...&quot; ../pureperl ...</p>

<p>Purify on NT Purify on Windows NT instruments the Perl
binary perl.exe on the fly. There are several options in the
makefile you should change to get the most use out of
Purify:</p>

<p>DEFINES You should add -DPURIFY to the DEFINES line so
the DEFINES line looks something like:</p>

<p>DEFINES = -DWIN32 -D_CONSOLE -DNO_STRICT $(CRYPT_FLAG)
-DPURIFY=1</p>

<p>to disable Perls arena memory allocation functions, as
well as to force use of memory allocation functions derived
from the system malloc.</p>

<p>USE_MULTI = define Enabling the multiplicity option
allows perl to clean up thoroughly when the interpreter
shuts down, which reduces the number of bogus leak reports
from Purify.</p>

<p>#PERL_MALLOC = define Disable Perls malloc so that
Purify can more closely monitor allocations and leaks. Using
Perls malloc will make Purify report most leaks in the
&quot;potential&quot; leaks category.</p>

<p>CFG = Debug Adds debugging information so that you see
the exact source statements where the problem occurs.
Without this flag, all you will see is the source filename
of where the error occurred.</p>

<p>As an example, to show any memory leaks produced during
the standard Perl testset you would create and run Purify
as:</p>

<p>cd win32 make cd ../t purify ../perl -I../lib
harness</p>

<p>which would instrument Perl in memory, run Perl on
test.pl, then finally report any memory problems.</p>

<p>valgrind The excellent valgrind tool can be used to find
out both memory leaks and illegal memory accesses. As of
version 3.3.0, Valgrind only supports Linux on x86, x86-64
and PowerPC. The special &quot;test.valgrind&quot; target
can be used to run the tests under valgrind. Found errors
and memory leaks are logged in files named
testfile.valgrind.</p>

<p>Valgrind also provides a cachegrind tool, invoked on
perl as:</p>

<p>VG_OPTS=--tool=cachegrind make test.valgrind</p>

<p>As system libraries (most notably glibc) are also
triggering errors, valgrind allows to suppress such errors
using suppression files. The default suppression file that
comes with valgrind already catches a lot of them. Some
additional suppressions are defined in t/perl.supp.</p>

<p>To get valgrind and for more information see</p>

<p>Compas/Digitas/Hs Third Degree Third Degree is a tool
for memory leak detection and memory access checks. It is
one of the many tools in the ATOM toolkit. The toolkit is
only available on Tru64 (formerly known as Digital UNIX
formerly known as DEC OSF/1).</p>

<p>When building Perl, you must first run Configure with
-Doptimize=-g and -Uusemymalloc flags, after that you can
use the make targets &quot;perl.third&quot; and
&quot;test.third&quot;. (What is required is that Perl must
be compiled using the &quot;-g&quot; flag, you may need to
re-Configure.)</p>

<p>The short story is that with &quot;atom&quot; you can
instrument the Perl executable to create a new executable
called perl.third. When the instrumented executable is run,
it creates a log of dubious memory traffic in file called
perl.3log. See the manual pages of atom and third for more
information. The most extensive Third Degree documentation
is available in the Compaq &quot;Tru64 UNIX Programmers
Guide&quot;, chapter &quot;Debugging Programs with Third
Degree&quot;.</p>

<p>The &quot;test.third&quot; leaves a lot of files named
foo_bar.3log in the t/ subdirectory. There is a problem with
these files: Third Degree is so effective that it finds
problems also in the system libraries. Therefore you should
used the Porting/thirdclean script to cleanup the *.3log
files.</p>

<p>There are also leaks that for given certain definition
of a leak, arent. See &quot;PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL&quot; for
more information.</p>

<p>PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL If you want to run any of the tests
yourself manually using e.g. valgrind, or the pureperl or
perl.third executables, please note that by default perl
does not explicitly cleanup all the memory it has allocated
(such as global memory arenas) but instead lets the exit()
of the whole program &quot;take care&quot; of such
allocations, also known as &quot;global destruction of
objects&quot;.</p>

<p>There is a way to tell perl to do complete cleanup: set
the environment variable PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL to a non-zero
value. The t/TEST wrapper does set this to 2, and this is
what you need to do too, if you dont want to see the
&quot;global leaks&quot;: For example, for
&quot;third-degreed&quot; Perl:</p>

<p>env PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL=2 ./perl.third -Ilib
t/foo/bar.t</p>

<p>(Note: the mod_perl apache module uses also this
environment variable for its own purposes and extended its
semantics. Refer to the mod_perl documentation for more
information. Also, spawned threads do the equivalent of
setting this variable to the value 1.)</p>

<p>If, at the end of a run you get the message N scalars
leaked, you can recompile with
&quot;-DDEBUG_LEAKING_SCALARS&quot;, which will cause the
addresses of all those leaked SVs to be dumped along with
details as to where each SV was originally allocated. This
information is also displayed by Devel::Peek. Note that the
extra details recorded with each SV increases memory usage,
so it shouldnt be used in production environments. It also
converts &quot;new_SV()&quot; from a macro into a real
function, so you can use your favourite debugger to discover
where those pesky SVs were allocated.</p>

<p>If you see that you re leaking memory at runtime, but
neither valgrind nor &quot;-DDEBUG_LEAKING_SCALARS&quot;
will find anything, youre probably leaking SVs that are
still reachable and will be properly cleaned up during
destruction of the interpreter. In such cases, using the
&quot;-Dm&quot; switch can point you to the source of the
leak. If the executable was built with
&quot;-DDEBUG_LEAKING_SCALARS&quot;, &quot;-Dm&quot; will
output SV allocations in addition to memory allocations.
Each SV allocation has a distinct serial number that will be
written on creation and destruction of the SV. So if youre
executing the leaking code in a loop, you need to look for
SVs that are created, but never destroyed between each
cycle. If such an SV is found, set a conditional breakpoint
within &quot;new_SV()&quot; and make it break only when
&quot;PL_sv_serial&quot; is equal to the serial number of
the leaking SV. Then you will catch the interpreter in
exactly the state where the leaking SV is allocated, which
is sufficient in many cases to find the source of the
leak.</p>

<p>As &quot;-Dm&quot; is using the PerlIO layer for output,
it will by itself allocate quite a bunch of SVs, which are
hidden to avoid recursion. You can bypass the PerlIO layer
if you use the SV logging provided by
&quot;-DPERL_MEM_LOG&quot; instead.</p>

<p>PERL_MEM_LOG If compiled with
&quot;-DPERL_MEM_LOG&quot;, all Newx() and Renew()
allocations and Safefree() in the Perl core go through
logging functions, which is handy for breakpoint setting. If
also compiled with &quot;-DPERL_MEM_LOG_STDERR&quot;, the
allocations and frees are logged to STDERR (or more
precisely, to the file descriptor 2) in these logging
functions, with the calling source code file and line number
(and C function name, if supported by the C compiler).</p>

<p>This logging is somewhat similar to &quot;-Dm&quot; but
independent of &quot;-DDEBUGGING&quot;, and at a higher
level (the &quot;-Dm&quot; is directly at the point of
&quot;malloc()&quot;, while the &quot;PERL_MEM_LOG&quot; is
at the level of &quot;New()&quot;).</p>

<p>In addition to memory allocations, SV allocations will
be logged, just as with &quot;-Dm&quot;. However, since the
logging doesn t use PerlIO, all SV allocations are logged
and no extra SV allocations are introduced by enabling the
logging. If compiled with
&quot;-DDEBUG_LEAKING_SCALARS&quot;, the serial number for
each SV allocation is also logged.</p>

<p>You can control the logging from your environment if you
compile with &quot;-DPERL_MEM_LOG_ENV&quot;. Then you need
to explicitly set &quot;PERL_MEM_LOG&quot; and/or
&quot;PERL_SV_LOG&quot; to a non-zero value to enable
logging of memory and/or SV allocations.</p>

<p>Profiling Depending on your platform there are various
of profiling Perl.</p>

<p>There are two commonly used techniques of profiling
executables: statistical time-sampling and basic-block
counting.</p>

<p>The first method takes periodically samples of the CPU
program counter, and since the program counter can be
correlated with the code generated for functions, we get a
statistical view of in which functions the program is
spending its time. The caveats are that very small/fast
functions have lower probability of showing up in the
profile, and that periodically interrupting the program
(this is usually done rather frequently, in the scale of
milliseconds) imposes an additional overhead that may skew
the results. The first problem can be alleviated by running
the code for longer (in general this is a good idea for
profiling), the second problem is usually kept in guard by
the profiling tools themselves.</p>

<p>The second method divides up the generated code into
basic blocks. Basic blocks are sections of code that are
entered only in the beginning and exited only at the end.
For example, a conditional jump starts a basic block. Basic
block profiling usually works by instrumenting the code by
adding enter basic block #nnnn book-keeping code to the
generated code. During the execution of the code the basic
block counters are then updated appropriately. The caveat is
that the added extra code can skew the results: again, the
profiling tools usually try to factor their own effects out
of the results.</p>

<p>Gprof Profiling gprof is a profiling tool available in
many UNIX platforms, it uses statistical time-sampling.</p>

<p>You can build a profiled version of perl called
&quot;perl.gprof&quot; by invoking the make target
&quot;perl.gprof&quot; (What is required is that Perl must
be compiled using the &quot;-pg&quot; flag, you may need to
re-Configure). Running the profiled version of Perl will
create an output file called gmon.out is created which
contains the profiling data collected during the
execution.</p>

<p>The gprof tool can then display the collected data in
various ways. Usually gprof understands the following
options:</p>

<p>-a Suppress statically defined functions from the
profile.</p>

<p>-b Suppress the verbose descriptions in the profile.</p>

<p>-e routine Exclude the given routine and its descendants
from the profile.</p>

<p>-f routine Display only the given routine and its
descendants in the profile.</p>

<p>-s Generate a summary file called gmon.sum which then
may be given to subsequent gprof runs to accumulate data
over several runs.</p>

<p>-z Display routines that have zero usage.</p>

<p>For more detailed explanation of the available commands
and output formats, see your own local documentation of
gprof.</p>

<p>quick hint:</p>

<p>$ sh Configure -des -Dusedevel
-Doptimize=&rsquo;-g&rsquo; -Accflags=&rsquo;-pg&rsquo;
-Aldflags=&rsquo;-pg&rsquo; &amp;&amp; make $ ./perl
someprog # creates gmon.out in current directory $ gprof
perl &gt; out $ view out</p>

<p>GCC gcov Profiling Starting from GCC 3.0 basic block
profiling is officially available for the GNU CC.</p>

<p>You can build a profiled version of perl called
perl.gcov by invoking the make target &quot;perl.gcov&quot;
(what is required that Perl must be compiled using gcc with
the flags &quot;-fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage&quot;, you
may need to re-Configure).</p>

<p>Running the profiled version of Perl will cause profile
output to be generated. For each source file an accompanying
&quot;.da&quot; file will be created.</p>

<p>To display the results you use the &quot;gcov&quot;
utility (which should be installed if you have gcc 3.0 or
newer installed). gcov is run on source code files, like
this</p>

<p>gcov sv.c</p>

<p>which will cause sv.c.gcov to be created. The .gcov
files contain the source code annotated with relative
frequencies of execution indicated by &quot;#&quot;
markers.</p>

<p>Useful options of gcov include &quot;-b&quot; which will
summarise the basic block, branch, and function call
coverage, and &quot;-c&quot; which instead of relative
frequencies will use the actual counts. For more information
on the use of gcov and basic block profiling with gcc, see
the latest GNU CC manual, as of GCC 3.0 see</p>

<p>http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-3.0/gcc.html</p>

<p>and its section titled &quot;8. gcov: a Test Coverage
Program&quot;</p>


<p>http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-3.0/gcc_8.html#SEC132</p>

<p>quick hint:</p>

<p>$ sh Configure -des -Doptimize=&rsquo;-g&rsquo;
-Accflags=&rsquo;-fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage&rsquo;
-Aldflags=&rsquo;-fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage&rsquo;
&amp;&amp; make perl.gcov $ rm -f regexec.c.gcov
regexec.gcda $ ./perl.gcov $ gcov regexec.c $ view
regexec.c.gcov</p>

<p>Pixie Profiling Pixie is a profiling tool available on
IRIX and Tru64 (aka Digital UNIX aka DEC OSF/1) platforms.
Pixie does its profiling using basic-block counting.</p>

<p>You can build a profiled version of perl called
perl.pixie by invoking the make target
&quot;perl.pixie&quot; (what is required is that Perl must
be compiled using the &quot;-g&quot; flag, you may need to
re-Configure).</p>

<p>In Tru64 a file called perl.Addrs will also be silently
created, this file contains the addresses of the basic
blocks. Running the profiled version of Perl will create a
new file called &quot;perl.Counts&quot; which contains the
counts for the basic block for that particular program
execution.</p>

<p>To display the results you use the prof utility. The
exact incantation depends on your operating system,
&quot;prof perl.Counts&quot; in IRIX, and &quot;prof -pixie
-all -L. perl&quot; in Tru64.</p>

<p>In IRIX the following prof options are available:</p>

<p>-h Reports the most heavily used lines in descending
order of use. Useful for finding the hotspot lines.</p>

<p>-l Groups lines by procedure, with procedures sorted in
descending order of use. Within a procedure, lines are
listed in source order. Useful for finding the hotspots of
procedures.</p>

<p>In Tru64 the following options are available:</p>

<p>-p[rocedures] Procedures sorted in descending order by
the number of cycles executed in each procedure. Useful for
finding the hotspot procedures. (This is the default
option.)</p>

<p>-h[eavy] Lines sorted in descending order by the number
of cycles executed in each line. Useful for finding the
hotspot lines.</p>

<p>-i[nvocations] The called procedures are sorted in
descending order by number of calls made to the procedures.
Useful for finding the most used procedures.</p>

<p>-l[ines] Grouped by procedure, sorted by cycles executed
per procedure. Useful for finding the hotspots of
procedures.</p>

<p>-testcoverage The compiler emitted code for these lines,
but the code was unexecuted.</p>

<p>-z[ero] Unexecuted procedures.</p>

<p>For further information, see your systems manual pages
for pixie and prof.</p>

<p>Miscellaneous tricks &middot; Those debugging perl with
the DDD frontend over gdb may find the following useful:</p>

<p>You can extend the data conversion shortcuts menu, so
for example you can display an SV s IV value with one click,
without doing any typing. To do that simply edit ~/.ddd/init
file and add after:</p>

<p>! Display shortcuts. Ddd*gdbDisplayShortcuts: /t () //
Convert to Bin /d () // Convert to Dec /x () // Convert to
Hex /o () // Convert to Oct( the following two lines:</p>

<p>((XPV*) (())-&gt;sv_any )-&gt;xpv_pv // 2pvx ((XPVIV*)
(())-&gt;sv_any )-&gt;xiv_iv // 2ivx</p>

<p>so now you can do ivx and pvx lookups or you can plug
there the sv_peek &quot;conversion&quot;:</p>

<p>Perl_sv_peek(my_perl, (SV*)()) // sv_peek</p>

<p>(The my_perl is for threaded builds.) Just remember that
every line, but the last one, should end with Alternatively
edit the init file interactively via: 3rd mouse button -&gt;
New Display -&gt; Edit Menu</p>

<p>Note: you can define up to 20 conversion shortcuts in
the gdb section.</p>

<p>&middot; If you see in a debugger a memory area
mysteriously full of 0xABABABAB or 0xEFEFEFEF, you may be
seeing the effect of the Poison() macros, see perlclib.</p>

<p>&middot; Under ithreads the optree is read only. If you
want to enforce this, to check for write accesses from buggy
code, compile with &quot;-DPL_OP_SLAB_ALLOC&quot; to enable
the OP slab allocator and
&quot;-DPERL_DEBUG_READONLY_OPS&quot; to enable code that
allocates op memory via &quot;mmap&quot;, and sets it
read-only at run time. Any write access to an op results in
a &quot;SIGBUS&quot; and abort.</p>

<p>This code is intended for development only, and may not
be portable even to all Unix variants. Also, it is an 80%
solution, in that it isnt able to make all ops read only.
Specifically it</p>

<p>1. Only sets read-only on all slabs of ops at
&quot;CHECK&quot; time, hence ops allocated later via
&quot;require&quot; or &quot;eval&quot; will be re-write</p>

<p>2. Turns an entire slab of ops read-write if the
refcount of any op in the slab needs to be decreased.</p>

<p>3. Turns an entire slab of ops read-write if any op from
the slab is freed.</p>

<p>Its not possible to turn the slabs to read-only after an
action requiring read-write access, as either can happen
during op tree building time, so there may still be
legitimate write access.</p>

<p>However, as an 80% solution it is still effective, as
currently it catches a write access during the generation of
Config.pm, which means that we cant yet build perl with this
enabled.</p>

<p>CONCLUSION We ve had a brief look around the Perl
source, how to maintain quality of the source code, an
overview of the stages perl goes through when its running
your code, how to use debuggers to poke at the Perl guts,
and finally how to analyse the execution of Perl. We took a
very simple problem and demonstrated how to solve it fully -
with documentation, regression tests, and finally a patch
for submission to p5p. Finally, we talked about how to use
external tools to debug and test Perl.</p>

<p>Id now suggest you read over those references again, and
then, as soon as possible, get your hands dirty. The best
way to learn is by doing, so:</p>

<p>&middot; Subscribe to perl5-porters, follow the patches
and try and understand them; don t be afraid to ask if
theres a portion youre not clear on - who knows, you may
unearth a bug in the patch...</p>

<p>&middot; Keep up to date with the bleeding edge Perl
distributions and get familiar with the changes. Try and get
an idea of what areas people are working on and the changes
theyre making.</p>

<p>&middot; Do read the README associated with your
operating system, e.g. README.aix on the IBM AIX OS. Dont
hesitate to supply patches to that README if you find
anything missing or changed over a new OS release.</p>

<p>&middot; Find an area of Perl that seems interesting to
you, and see if you can work out how it works. Scan through
the source, and step over it in the debugger. Play, poke,
investigate, fiddle! Youll probably get to understand not
just your chosen area but a much wider range of perls
activity as well, and probably sooner than you d think.</p>

<p>The Road goes ever on and on, down from the door where
it began.</p>

<p>If you can do these things, youve started on the long
road to Perl porting. Thanks for wanting to help make Perl
better - and happy hacking!</p>

<p>Metaphoric Quotations If you recognized the quote about
the Road above, youre in luck.</p>

<p>Most software projects begin each file with a literal
description of each files purpose. Perl instead begins each
with a literary allusion to that files purpose.</p>

<p>Like chapters in many books, all top-level Perl source
files (along with a few others here and there) begin with an
epigramic inscription that alludes, indirectly and
metaphorically, to the material youre about to read.</p>

<p>Quotations are taken from writings of J.R.R Tolkien
pertaining to his Legendarium, almost always from The Lord
of the Rings. Chapters and page numbers are given using the
following editions:</p>

<p>&middot; The Hobbit, by J.R.R. Tolkien. The hardcover,
70th-anniversary edition of 2007 was used, published in the
UK by Harper Collins Publishers and in the US by the
Houghton Mifflin Company.</p>

<p>&middot; The Lord of the Rings, by J.R.R. Tolkien. The
hardcover, 50th-anniversary edition of 2004 was used,
published in the UK by Harper Collins Publishers and in the
US by the Houghton Mifflin Company.</p>

<p>&middot; The Lays of Beleriand, by J.R.R. Tolkien and
published posthumously by his son and literary executor,
C.J.R. Tolkien, being the 3rd of the 12 volumes in
Christopher s mammoth History of Middle Earth. Page numbers
derive from the hardcover edition, first published in 1983
by George Allen &amp; Unwin; no page numbers changed for the
special 3-volume omnibus edition of 2002 or the various
trade-paper editions, all again now by Harper Collins or
Houghton Mifflin.</p>

<p>Other JRRT books fair game for quotes would thus include
The Adventures of Tom Bombadil, The Silmarillion, Unfinished
Tales, and The Tale of the Children of Hurin, all but the
first posthumously assembled by CJRT. But The Lord of the
Rings itself is perfectly fine and probably best to quote
from, provided you can find a suitable quote there.</p>

<p>So if you were to supply a new, complete, top-level
source file to add to Perl, you should conform to this
peculiar practice by yourself selecting an appropriate
quotation from Tolkien, retaining the original spelling and
punctuation and using the same format the rest of the quotes
are in. Indirect and oblique is just fine; remember, its a
metaphor, so being meta is, after all, what its for.</p>
