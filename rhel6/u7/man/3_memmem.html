<p>NAME memmem - locate a substring</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #define _GNU_SOURCE #include
&lt;string.h&gt;</p>

<p>void *memmem(const void *haystack, size_t haystacklen,
const void *needle, size_t needlelen);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The memmem() function finds the start of the
first occurrence of the substring needle of length needlelen
in the memory area haystack of length haystacklen.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The memmem() function returns a pointer to
the beginning of the sub- string, or NULL if the substring
is not found.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO This function is a GNU extension.</p>

<p>BUGS This function was broken in Linux libraries up to
and including libc 5.0.9; there the needle and haystack
arguments were interchanged, and a pointer to the end of the
first occurrence of needle was returned.</p>

<p>Both old and new libcs have the bug that if needle is
empty, haystack-1 (instead of haystack) is returned. And
glibc 2.0 makes it worse, returning a pointer to the last
byte of haystack. This is fixed in glibc 2.1.</p>
