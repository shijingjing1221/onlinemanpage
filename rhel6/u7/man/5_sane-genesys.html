<p>sane-genesys(5) SANE Scanner Access Now Easy
sane-genesys(5)</p>

<p>NAME sane-genesys - SANE backend for GL646 and GL841
based USB flatbed scan- ners</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sane-genesys library implements a SANE
(Scanner Access Now Easy) backend that provides access to
USB flatbed scanners based on the Genesys GL646 and GL841
chips. At present, the following scanners are known to work
with this backend:</p>

<p>Medion MD5345/MD6228/MD6274 Visioneer OneTouch 7100
Hewlett-Packard HP2300C Visioneer Strobe XP100
(rev3)/XP200/XP300/Roadwarrior Canon LiDE 35/40/50/60 Pentax
DSmobile 600 Syscan/Ambir DocketPORT 485/487/665/685 Xerox
Travel Scanner 100</p>

<p>This is stable software for supported models. But if you
test new or untested scanners, keep your hand at the
scanners plug and unplug it, if the head bumps at the end of
the scan area.</p>

<p>If you own a scanner other than the ones listed above
that works with this backend, please let me know this by
sending the scanners exact model name and the USB vendor and
device ids (e.g. from /proc/bus/usb/devices,
sane-find-scanner or syslog) to the sane-devel mailing list.
Even if the scanner s name is only slightly different from
the models mentioned above, please let me know.</p>

<p>If you own a scanner that isnt detected by the genesys
backend but has a GL646 or GL841 chipset, you can try to add
it to the backend.</p>

<p>CALIBRATION To give correct image quality, sheet fed
scanners need to be calibrated using the calibration sheet
sold with the scanner. To do calibration, you must insert
this target in the feeder then start calibration either by
passing the --calibrate option to scanimage or by clicking
on the available calibrate button in the advanced options in
a graphical frontend. The result of the calibration is
stored in a file in the home directory of the user doing it.
If you plug the scanner in another machine or use it with
another account, calibration will have to be redone.</p>

<p>EXTRAS SCAN OPTIONS --lamp-off-time number The lamp will
be turned off after the given time (in minutes). A value of
0 means that the lamp wont be turned off.</p>

<p>--threshold percent 0..100% (in steps of 1). Select
minimum brightness to get a white point. Pixels whith
brightness below that value will be scanned as black.</p>

<p>--disable-interpolation yes|no When using high
resolutions where the horizontal resolution is smaller than
vertical resolution, data is expanded by software to pre-
serve picture geometry. This can be disbled by this option
to get real scanned data.</p>

<p>--color-filter None|Red|Green|Blue When using gray or
lineart this option selects the used color. Using a color
filter will give a monochrome scan. CIS based scanners can
to true gray when no filter (None value) is selected.</p>

<p>SYSTEM ISSUES This backend needs libusb-0.1.6 or later
installed, and hasnt tested in other configuration than a
linux kernel 2.6.9 or higher. However, it should work any
system with libusb where the SANE package can be com- piled.
For setting permissions and general USB information look at
sane-usb(5).</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION The contents of the genesys.conf file is a
list of usb lines containing vendor and product ids that
correspond to USB scanners. The file can also contain option
lines. Empty lines and lines starting with a hash mark (#)
are ignored. The scanners are autodetected by usb vendor_id
product_id statements which are already included into
genesys.conf. &quot;vendor_id&quot; and
&quot;product_id&quot; are hexadecimal numbers that identify
the scanner.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/sane.d/genesys.conf The backend configuration
file (see also description of SANE_CONFIG_DIR below).</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-genesys.a The static library
implementing this backend.</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-genesys.so The shared library
implementing this backend (present on systems that support
dynamic loading).</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT SANE_CONFIG_DIR This environment variable
specifies the list of directories that may contain the
configuration file. Under UNIX, the directories are
separated by a colon (:), under OS/2, they are separated by
a semi-colon (;). If this variable is not set, the config-
uration file is searched in two default directories: first,
the current working directory (&quot;.&quot;) and then in
/etc/sane.d. If the value of the environment variable ends
with the directory sepa- rator character, then the default
directories are searched after the explicitly specified
directories. For example, setting SANE_CONFIG_DIR to
&quot;/tmp/config:&quot; would result in directories
&quot;tmp/config&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and
&quot;/etc/sane.d&quot; being searched (in this order).</p>

<p>SANE_DEBUG_GENESYS If the library was compiled with
debug support enabled, this environment variable controls
the debug level for this backend. Higher debug levels
increase the verbosity of the output. If the debug level is
set to 1 or higher, some debug options become available that
are normally hidden. Handle them with care. This will print
messages related to core genesys functions.</p>

<p>SANE_DEBUG_GENESYS_GL646 This environment variable
controls the debug level for the spe- cific GL646 code
part.</p>

<p>SANE_DEBUG_GENESYS_GL841 This environment variable
controls the debug level for the spe- cific GL841 code
part.</p>

<p>Example (full and highly verbose output for gl646):
export SANE_DEBUG_GENESYS=255 export
SANE_DEBUG_GENESYS_GL646=255</p>

<p>CREDITS Jack McGill for donating several sheetfed
scanners, which made possible to add support for them in the
genesys backend.</p>
