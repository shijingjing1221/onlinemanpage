<p>NAME sadc - System activity data collector.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS /usr/lib64/sa/sadc [ -C comment ] [ -S { INT |
DISK | SNMP | IPV6 | POWER | XDISK | ALL | XALL } ] [ -F ] [
-L ] [ -V ] [ interval [ count ] ] [ outfile ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sadc command samples system data a
specified number of times (count) at a specified interval
measured in seconds (interval). It writes in binary format
to the specified outfile or to standard output. If outfile
is set to -, then sadc uses the standard system activity
daily data file, the /var/log/sa/sadd file, where the dd
parameter indicates the current day. In this case, sadc will
overwrite the file if it is from a previous month. By
default sadc collects all the data available from the
kernel. Exceptions are interrupts and disk data, for which
the relevant options must be explicitly passed to sadc (see
options below).</p>

<p>When the count parameter is not specified, sadc writes
its data end- lessly. When both interval and count are not
specified, and option -C is not used, a dummy record, which
is used at system startup to mark the time when the counter
restarts from 0, will be written. For exam- ple, one of the
system startup script may write the restart mark to the
daily data file by the command entry:</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sa/sadc -</p>

<p>The sadc command is intended to be used as a backend to
the sar com- mand.</p>

<p>Note: The sadc command only reports on local
activities.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -C comment When neither the interval nor the
count parameters are speci- fied, this option tells sadc to
write a dummy record containing the specified comment
string. This comment can then be dis- played with option -C
of sar.</p>

<p>-F The creation of outfile will be forced. If the file
already exists and has not the format expected by sadc then
it will be truncated. This may be useful for daily data
files created by an older version of sadc and whose format
is no longer compatible with current one.</p>

<p>-L sadc will try to get an exclusive lock on the outfile
before writing to it or truncating it. Failure to get the
lock is fatal, except in the case of trying to write a
normal (i.e. not a dummy and not a header) record to an
existing file, in which case sadc will try again at the next
interval. Usually, the only reason a lock would fail would
be if another sadc process were also writing to the file.
This can happen when cron is used to launch sadc. If the
system is under heavy load, an old sadc might still be
running when cron starts a new one. Without lock- ing, this
situation can result in a corrupted system activity
file.</p>

<p>-S { INT | DISK | SNMP | IPV6 | POWER | XDISK | ALL |
XALL } Specify which optional activities should be collected
by sadc. Some activities are optional to prevent data files
from growing too large. The INT keyword indicates that sadc
should collect data for system interrupts. The DISK keyword
indicates that sadc should collect data for block devices.
The SNMP and IPV6 keywords indicate respectively that SNMP
and IPv6 statistics should be collected by sadc. The POWER
keyword indicates that sadc should collect power management
statistics. The ALL key- word is equivalent to specifying
all the keywords above and therefore all previous activities
are collected.</p>

<p>The XDISK keyword is an extension to the DISK one and
indicates that partition statistics should be collected by
sadc in addi- tion to disk statistics. This option works
only with kernels 2.6.25 and later. The XALL keyword is
equivalent to specifying all the keywords above (including
keyword extensions) and there- fore all possible activities
are collected.</p>

<p>Important note: The activities (including optional ones)
saved in an existing data file prevail over those selected
with option -S. As a consequence, appending data to an
existing data file will result in option -S being
ignored.</p>

<p>-V Print version number then exit.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT The sadc command takes into account the
following environment variable:</p>

<p>S_TIME_DEF_TIME If this variable exists and its value is
UTC then sadc will save its data in UTC time. sadc will also
use UTC time instead of local time to determine the current
daily data file located in the /var/log/sa directory.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES /usr/lib64/sa/sadc 1 10 /tmp/datafile Write 10
records of one second intervals to the /tmp/datafile binary
file.</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sa/sadc -C Backup_Start /tmp/datafile Insert
the comment Backup_Start into the file /tmp/datafile.</p>

<p>BUGS The /proc filesystem must be mounted for the sadc
command to work.</p>

<p>All the statistics are not necessarily available,
depending on the ker- nel version used.</p>

<p>FILES /var/log/sa/sadd Indicate the daily data file,
where the dd parameter is a number representing the day of
the month.</p>

<p>/proc contains various files with system statistics.</p>
