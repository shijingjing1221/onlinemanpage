ABRT-ACTION-ANALYZ(1)</p>

<p>NAME abrt-action-analyze-backtrace - Analyzes C/C++
backtrace, generates duplication hash, backtrace rating, and
identifies crash function in problem directory DIR.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS abrt-action-analyze-backtrace [-v] [-d DIR]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The tool reads a file named backtrace from
problem directory, generates duplication hash, backtrace
rating, and identifies crash function. Then it saves this
data as new elements global_uuid, rating, crash_function in
this problem directory.</p>

<p>Integration with libreport events
abrt-action-analyze-backtrace can be used as a secondary
analyzer, after backtrace has been generated. The data
generated by abrt-action-analyze-backtrace is useful for
reporting the crash to bug databases: rating makes it
possible to prevent reporting of bugs with low quality
(non-informative) backtraces, duplication hash is used to
find already filed bugs about similar crashes.</p>

<p>Example usage in report_event.conf:</p>

<p>EVENT=analyze analyzer=CCpp
abrt-action-generate-backtrace || exit $?
abrt-action-analyze-backtrace</p>

<p>OPTIONS -d DIR Path to problem directory.</p>

<p>-v Be more verbose. Can be given multiple times.</p>
