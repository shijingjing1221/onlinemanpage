<p>NAME gpgconf - Modify .gnupg home directories</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS gpgconf [options] --list-components gpgconf
[options] --list-options component gpgconf [options]
--change-options component</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The gpgconf is a utility to automatically
and reasonable safely query and modify configuration files
in the .gnupg home directory. It is designed not to be
invoked manually by the user, but automatically by graphical
user interfaces (GUI). ([Please note that currently no lock-
ing is done, so concurrent access should be avoided. There
are some precautions to avoid corruption with concurrent
usage, but results may be inconsistent and some changes may
get lost. The stateless design makes it difficult to provide
more guarantees.])</p>

<p>gpgconf provides access to the configuration of one or
more components of the GnuPG system. These components
correspond more or less to the programs that exist in the
GnuPG framework, like GnuPG, GPGSM, DirMngr, etc. But this
is not a strict one-to-one relationship. Not all con-
figuration options are available through gpgconf. gpgconf
provides a generic and abstract method to access the most
important configuration options that can feasibly be
controlled via such a mechanism.</p>

<p>gpgconf can be used to gather and change the options
available in each component, and can also provide their
default values. gpgconf will give detailed type information
that can be used to restrict the users input without making
an attempt to commit the changes.</p>

<p>gpgconf provides the backend of a configuration editor.
The configura- tion editor would usually be a graphical user
interface program, that allows to display the current
options, their default values, and allows the user to make
changes to the options. These changes can then be made
active with gpgconf again. Such a program that uses gpgconf
in this way will be called GUI throughout this section.</p>

<p>COMMANDS One of the following commands must be
given:</p>

<p>--list-components List all components. This is the
default command used if none is specified.</p>

<p>--check-programs List all available backend programs and
test whether they are runnable.</p>

<p>--list-options component List all options of the
component component.</p>

<p>--change-options component Change the options of the
component component.</p>

<p>--check-options component Check the options for the
component component.</p>

<p>--apply-defaults Update all configuration files with
values taken from the global configuration file (usually
/etc/gnupg/gpgconf.conf ).</p>

<p>--list-dirs Lists the directories used by gpgconf. One
directory is listed per line, and each line consists of a
colon-separated list where the first field names the
directory type (for example sysconfdir) and the second field
contains the percent-escaped directory. Although they are
not directories, the socket file names used by gpg-agent and
dirmngr are printed as well. Note that the socket file names
and the homedir lines are the default names and they may be
overridden by command line switches.</p>

<p>--list-config [filename] List the global configuration
file in a colon separated format. If filename is given,
check that file instead.</p>

<p>--check-config [filename] Run a syntax check on the
global configuration file. If file- name is given, check
that file instead.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The following options may be used:</p>

<p>-v</p>

<p>--verbose Outputs additional information while running.
Specifically, this extends numerical field values by
human-readable descrip- tions.</p>

<p>-n</p>

<p>--dry-run Do not actually change anything. This is
currently only imple- mented for --change-options and can be
used for testing pur- poses.</p>

<p>-r</p>

<p>--runtime Only used together with --change-options. If
one of the modi- fied options can be changed in a running
daemon process, signal the running daemon to ask it to
reparse its configuration file after changing.</p>

<p>This means that the changes will take effect at
run-time, as far as this is possible. Otherwise, they will
take effect at the next start of the respective backend
programs.</p>

<p>USAGE The command --list-components will list all
components that can be con- figured with gpgconf. Usually,
one component will correspond to one GnuPG-related program
and contain the options of that programs configu- ration
file that can be modified using gpgconf. However, this is
not necessarily the case. A component might also be a group
of selected options from several programs, or contain
entirely virtual options that have a special effect rather
than changing exactly one option in one configuration
file.</p>

<p>A component is a set of configuration options that
semantically belong together. Furthermore, several changes
to a component can be made in an atomic way with a single
operation. The GUI could for example pro- vide a menu with
one entry for each component, or a window with one tabulator
sheet per component.</p>

<p>The command argument --list-components lists all
available components, one per line. The format of each line
is:</p>

<p>name:description:pgmname:</p>

<p>name This field contains a name tag of the component.
The name tag is used to specify the component in all
communication with gpg- conf. The name tag is to be used
verbatim. It is thus not in any escaped format.</p>

<p>description The string in this field contains a
human-readable description of the component. It can be
displayed to the user of the GUI for informational purposes.
It is percent-escaped and local- ized.</p>

<p>pgmname The string in this field contains the absolute
name of the pro- grams file. It can be used to unambiguously
invoke that pro- gram. It is percent-escaped.</p>

<p>Example: $ gpgconf --list-components gpg:GPG for
OpenPGP:/usr/local/bin/gpg2: gpg-agent:GPG
Agent:/usr/local/bin/gpg-agent: scdaemon:Smartcard
Daemon:/usr/local/bin/scdaemon: gpgsm:GPG for
S/MIME:/usr/local/bin/gpgsm: dirmngr:Directory
Manager:/usr/local/bin/dirmngr:</p>

<p>Checking programs</p>

<p>The command --check-programs is similar to
--list-components but works on backend programs and not on
components. It runs each program to test whether it is
installed and runnable. This also includes a syntax check of
all config file options of the program.</p>

<p>The command argument --check-programs lists all
available programs, one per line. The format of each line
is:</p>


<p>name:description:pgmname:avail:okay:cfgfile:line:error:</p>

<p>name This field contains a name tag of the program which
is identical to the name of the component. The name tag is
to be used verba- tim. It is thus not in any escaped format.
This field may be empty to indicate a continuation of error
descriptions for the last name. The description and pgmname
fields are then also empty.</p>

<p>description The string in this field contains a
human-readable description of the component. It can be
displayed to the user of the GUI for informational purposes.
It is percent-escaped and local- ized.</p>

<p>pgmname The string in this field contains the absolute
name of the pro- grams file. It can be used to unambiguously
invoke that pro- gram. It is percent-escaped.</p>

<p>avail The boolean value in this field indicates whether
the program is installed and runnable.</p>

<p>okay The boolean value in this field indicates whether
the programs config file is syntactically okay.</p>

<p>cfgfile If an error occurred in the configuration file
(as indicated by a false value in the field okay), this
field has the name of the failing configuration file. It is
percent-escaped.</p>

<p>line If an error occurred in the configuration file,
this field has the line number of the failing statement in
the configuration file. It is an unsigned number.</p>

<p>error If an error occurred in the configuration file,
this field has the error text of the failing statement in
the configuration file. It is percent-escaped and
localized.</p>

<p>In the following example the dirmngr is not runnable and
the configuration file of scdaemon is not okay.</p>

<p>$ gpgconf --check-programs gpg:GPG for
OpenPGP:/usr/local/bin/gpg2:1:1: gpg-agent:GPG
Agent:/usr/local/bin/gpg-agent:1:1: scdaemon:Smartcard
Daemon:/usr/local/bin/scdaemon:1:0: gpgsm:GPG for
S/MIME:/usr/local/bin/gpgsm:1:1: dirmngr:Directory
Manager:/usr/local/bin/dirmngr:0:0:</p>

<p>The command configuration file in the same manner as
--check-programs, but only for the component component.</p>

<p>Listing options</p>

<p>Every component contains one or more options. Options
may be gathered into option groups to allow the GUI to give
visual hints to the user about which options are
related.</p>

<p>The command argument lists all options (and the groups
they belong to) in the component component, one per line.
component must be the string in the field name in the output
of the --list-components command.</p>

<p>There is one line for each option and each group. First
come all options that are not in any group. Then comes a
line describing a group. Then come all options that belong
into each group. Then comes the next group and so on. There
does not need to be any group (and in this case the output
will stop after the last non-grouped option).</p>

<p>The format of each line is:</p>


<p>name:flags:level:description:type:alt-type:argname:default:argdef:value</p>

<p>name This field contains a name tag for the group or
option. The name tag is used to specify the group or option
in all communi- cation with gpgconf. The name tag is to be
used verbatim. It is thus not in any escaped format.</p>

<p>flags The flags field contains an unsigned number. Its
value is the OR-wise combination of the following flag
values:</p>

<p>group (1) If this flag is set, this is a line describing
a group and not an option.</p>

<p>The following flag values are only defined for options
(that is, if the group flag is not used).</p>

<p>optional arg (2) If this flag is set, the argument is
optional. This is never set for type 0 (none) options.</p>

<p>list (4) If this flag is set, the option can be given
multiple times.</p>

<p>runtime (8) If this flag is set, the option can be
changed at run- time.</p>

<p>default (16) If this flag is set, a default value is
available.</p>

<p>default desc (32) If this flag is set, a (runtime)
default is available. This and the default flag are mutually
exclusive.</p>

<p>no arg desc (64) If this flag is set, and the optional
arg flag is set, then the option has a special meaning if no
argument is given.</p>

<p>no change (128) If this flag is set, gpgconf ignores
requests to change the value. GUI frontends should grey out
this option. Note, that manual changes of the configuration
files are still possible.</p>

<p>level This field is defined for options and for groups.
It contains an unsigned number that specifies the expert
level under which this group or option should be displayed.
The following expert levels are defined for options (they
have analogous meaning for groups):</p>

<p>basic (0) This option should always be offered to the
user.</p>

<p>advanced (1) This option may be offered to advanced
users.</p>

<p>expert (2) This option should only be offered to expert
users.</p>

<p>invisible (3) This option should normally never be
displayed, not even to expert users.</p>

<p>internal (4) This option is for internal use only.
Ignore it.</p>

<p>The level of a group will always be the lowest level of
all options it contains.</p>

<p>description This field is defined for options and
groups. The string in this field contains a human-readable
description of the option or group. It can be displayed to
the user of the GUI for infor- mational purposes. It is
percent-escaped and localized.</p>

<p>type This field is only defined for options. It contains
an unsigned number that specifies the type of the options
argument, if any. The following types are defined:</p>

<p>Basic types:</p>

<p>none (0) No argument allowed.</p>

<p>string (1) An unformatted string.</p>

<p>int32 (2) A signed number.</p>

<p>uint32 (3) An unsigned number.</p>

<p>Complex types:</p>

<p>pathname (32) A string that describes the pathname of a
file. The file does not necessarily need to exist.</p>

<p>ldap server (33) A string that describes an LDAP server
in the format:</p>

<p>hostname:port:username:password:base_dn</p>

<p>key fingerprint (34) A string with a 40 digit
fingerprint specifying a cer- tificate.</p>

<p>pub key (35) A string that describes a certificate by
user ID, key ID or fingerprint.</p>

<p>sec key (36) A string that describes a certificate with
a key by user ID, key ID or fingerprint.</p>

<p>alias list (37) A string that describes an alias list,
like the one used with gpgs group option. The list consists
of a key, an equal sign and space separated values.</p>

<p>More types will be added in the future. Please see the
alt-type field for information on how to cope with unknown
types.</p>

<p>alt-type This field is identical to type, except that
only the types 0 to 31 are allowed. The GUI is expected to
present the user the option in the format specified by type.
But if the argument type type is not supported by the GUI,
it can still display the option in the more generic basic
type alt-type. The GUI must support all the defined basic
types to be able to display all options. More basic types
may be added in future versions. If the GUI encounters a
basic type it doesnt support, it should report an error and
abort the operation.</p>

<p>argname This field is only defined for options with an
argument type type that is not 0. In this case it may
contain a percent- escaped and localised string that gives a
short name for the argument. The field may also be empty,
though, in which case a short name is not known.</p>

<p>default This field is defined only for options for which
the default or default desc flag is set. If the default flag
is set, its for- mat is that of an option argument (see:
[Format conventions], for details). If the default value is
empty, then no default is known. Otherwise, the value
specifies the default value for this option. If the default
desc flag is set, the field is either empty or contains a
description of the effect if the option is not given.</p>

<p>argdef This field is defined only for options for which
the optional arg flag is set. If the no arg desc flag is not
set, its format is that of an option argument (see: [Format
conventions], for details). If the default value is empty,
then no default is known. Otherwise, the value specifies the
default argument for this option. If the no arg desc flag is
set, the field is either empty or contains a description of
the effect of this option if no argument is given.</p>

<p>value This field is defined only for options. Its format
is that of an option argument. If it is empty, then the
option is not explicitly set in the current configuration,
and the default applies (if any). Otherwise, it contains the
current value of the option. Note that this field is also
meaningful if the option itself does not take a real
argument (in this case, it contains the number of times the
option appears).</p>

<p>Changing options</p>

<p>The command to change the options of the component
component to the specified values. component must be the
string in the field name in the output of the
--list-components command. You have to provide the options
that shall be changed in the following format on standard
input:</p>

<p>name:flags:new-value</p>

<p>name This is the name of the option to change. name must
be the string in the field name in the output of the
--list-options command.</p>

<p>flags The flags field contains an unsigned number. Its
value is the OR-wise combination of the following flag
values:</p>

<p>default (16) If this flag is set, the option is deleted
and the default value is used instead (if applicable).</p>

<p>new-value The new value for the option. This field is
only defined if the default flag is not set. The format is
that of an option argu- ment. If it is empty (or the field
is omitted), the default argument is used (only allowed if
the argument is optional for this option). Otherwise, the
option will be set to the speci- fied value.</p>

<p>The output of the command is the same as that of
--check-options for the modified configuration file.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<p>To set the force option, which is of basic type none
(0):</p>

<p>$ echo force:0:1 | gpgconf --change-options dirmngr</p>

<p>To delete the force option:</p>

<p>$ echo force:16: | gpgconf --change-options dirmngr</p>

<p>The --runtime option can influence when the changes take
effect.</p>

<p>Listing global options</p>

<p>Sometimes it is useful for applications to look at the
global options file gpgconf.conf. The colon separated
listing format is record ori- ented and uses the first field
to identify the record type:</p>

<p>k This describes a key record to start the definition of
a new ruleset for a user/group. The format of a key record
is:</p>

<p>k:user:group:</p>

<p>user This is the user field of the key. It is percent
escaped. See the definition of the gpgconf.conf format for
details.</p>

<p>group This is the group field of the key. It is percent
escaped.</p>

<p>r This describes a rule record. All rule records up to
the next key record make up a rule set for that key. The
format of a rule record is:</p>

<p>r:::component:option:flags:value:</p>

<p>component This is the component part of a rule. It is a
plain string.</p>

<p>option This is the option part of a rule. It is a plain
string.</p>

<p>flag This is the flags part of a rule. There may be only
one flag per rule but by using the same component and
option, several flags may be assigned to an option. It is a
plain string.</p>

<p>value This is the optional value for the option. It is a
per- cent escaped string with a single quotation mark to
indi- cate a string. The quotation mark is only required to
distinguish between no value specified and an empty
string.</p>

<p>Unknown record types should be ignored. Note that there
is intention- ally no feature to change the global option
file through gpgconf.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/gnupg/gpgconf.conf If this file exists, it is
processed as a global configuration file. A commented
example can be found in the examples directory of the
distribution.</p>

<p>The full documentation for this tool is maintained as a
Texinfo manual. If GnuPG and the info program are properly
installed at your site, the command</p>

<p>info gnupg</p>

<p>should give you access to the complete manual including
a menu struc- ture and an index.</p>
