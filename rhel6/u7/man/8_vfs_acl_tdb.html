<p>NAME vfs_acl_tdb - Save NTFS-ACLs in a tdb file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS vfs objects = acl_tdb</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This VFS module is part of the samba(7)
suite.</p>

<p>The vfs_acl_tdb VFS module stores NTFS Access Control
Lists (ACLs) in a tdb file. This enables the full mapping of
Windows ACLs on Samba servers.</p>

<p>The ACL settings are stored in
$LOCKDIR/file_ntacls.tdb.</p>

<p>This module is stackable.</p>

<p>OPTIONS acl_tdb:ignore system acls = [yes|no] When set
to yes, a best effort mapping from/to the POSIX ACL layer
will not be done by this module. The default is no, which
means that Samba keeps setting and evaluating both the
system ACLs and the NT ACLs. This is better if you need your
system ACLs be set for local or NFS file access, too. If you
only access the data via Samba you might set this to yes to
achieve better NT ACL compatibility.</p>

<p>AUTHOR The original Samba software and related utilities
were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by
the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way
the Linux kernel is developed.</p>
