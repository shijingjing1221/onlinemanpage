<p>PERF-REPORT(1) perf Manual PERF-REPORT(1)</p>

<p>NAME perf-report - Read perf.data (created by perf
record) and display the profile</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS perf report [-i &lt;file&gt; |
--input=file]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This command displays the performance
counter profile information recorded via perf record.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -i, --input= Input file name. (default:
perf.data unless stdin is a fifo)</p>

<p>-v, --verbose Be more verbose. (show symbol address,
etc)</p>

<p>-n, --show-nr-samples Show the number of samples for
each symbol</p>

<p>--showcpuutilization Show sample percentage for
different cpu modes.</p>

<p>-T, --threads Show per-thread event counters</p>

<p>-c, --comms= Only consider symbols in these comms. CSV
that understands file://filename entries. This option will
affect the percentage of the overhead column. See
--percentage for more info.</p>

<p>-d, --dsos= Only consider symbols in these dsos. CSV
that understands file://filename entries. This option will
affect the percentage of the overhead column. See
--percentage for more info.</p>

<p>-S, --symbols= Only consider these symbols. CSV that
understands file://filename entries. This option will affect
the percentage of the overhead column. See --percentage for
more info.</p>

<p>--symbol-filter= Only show symbols that match
(partially) with this filter.</p>

<p>-U, --hide-unresolved Only display entries resolved to a
symbol.</p>

<p>-s, --sort= Sort histogram entries by given key(s) -
multiple keys can be specified in CSV format. Following sort
keys are available: pid, comm, dso, symbol, parent, cpu,
srcline, weight, local_weight.</p>

<p>Each key has following meaning:</p>

<p>&middot; comm: command (name) of the task which can be
read via /proc/&lt;pid&gt;/comm</p>

<p>&middot; pid: command and tid of the task</p>

<p>&middot; dso: name of library or module executed at the
time of sample</p>

<p>&middot; symbol: name of function executed at the time
of sample</p>

<p>&middot; parent: name of function matched to the parent
regex filter. Unmatched entries are displayed as
&quot;[other]&quot;.</p>

<p>&middot; cpu: cpu number the task ran at the time of
sample</p>

<p>&middot; srcline: filename and line number executed at
the time of sample. The DWARF debugging info must be
provided.</p>

<p>&middot; weight: Event specific weight, e.g. memory
latency or transaction abort cost. This is the global
weight.</p>

<p>&middot; local_weight: Local weight version of the
weight above.</p>

<p>&middot; transaction: Transaction abort flags.</p>

<p>&middot; overhead: Overhead percentage of sample</p>

<p>&middot; overhead_sys: Overhead percentage of sample
running in system mode</p>

<p>&middot; overhead_us: Overhead percentage of sample
running in user mode</p>

<p>&middot; overhead_guest_sys: Overhead percentage of
sample running in system mode on guest machine</p>

<p>&middot; overhead_guest_us: Overhead percentage of
sample running in user mode on guest machine</p>

<p>&middot; sample: Number of sample</p>

<p>&middot; period: Raw number of event count of sample</p>

<p>By default, comm, dso and symbol keys are used. (i.e.
--sort comm,dso,symbol)</p>

<p>If --branch-stack option is used, following sort keys
are also available: dso_from, dso_to, symbol_from,
symbol_to, mispredict.</p>

<p>&middot; dso_from: name of library or module branched
from</p>

<p>&middot; dso_to: name of library or module branched
to</p>

<p>&middot; symbol_from: name of function branched from</p>

<p>&middot; mispredict: &quot;N&quot; for predicted branch,
&quot;Y&quot; for mispredicted branch</p>

<p>&middot; in_tx: branch in TSX transaction</p>

<p>&middot; abort: TSX transaction abort.</p>

<p>And default sort keys are changed to comm, dso_from,
symbol_from, dso_to and symbol_to, see
&acute;--branch-stack&acute;.</p>

<p>-F, --fields= Specify output field - multiple keys can
be specified in CSV format. Following fields are available:
overhead, overhead_sys, overhead_us, overhead_children,
sample and period. Also it can contain any sort key(s).</p>

<p>By default, every sort keys not specified in -F will be
appended automatically.</p>

<p>If --mem-mode option is used, following sort keys are
also available (incompatible with --branch-stack):
symbol_daddr, dso_daddr, locked, tlb, mem, snoop,
dcacheline.</p>

<p>&middot; symbol_daddr: name of data symbol being
executed on at the time of sample</p>

<p>&middot; dso_daddr: name of library or module containing
the data being executed on at the time of sample</p>

<p>&middot; locked: whether the bus was locked at the time
of sample</p>

<p>&middot; tlb: type of tlb access for the data at the
time of sample</p>

<p>&middot; mem: type of memory access for the data at the
time of sample</p>

<p>&middot; snoop: type of snoop (if any) for the data at
the time of sample</p>

<p>&middot; dcacheline: the cacheline the data address is
on at the time of sample</p>

<p>And default sort keys are changed to local_weight, mem,
sym, dso, symbol_daddr, dso_daddr, snoop, tlb, locked, see
&acute;--mem-mode&acute;.</p>

<p>-p, --parent=&lt;regex&gt; A regex filter to identify
parent. The parent is a caller of this function and searched
through the callchain, thus it requires callchain
information recorded. The pattern is in the exteneded regex
format and defaults to &quot;^sys_|^do_page_fault&quot;, see
--sort parent.</p>

<p>-x, --exclude-other Only display entries with
parent-match.</p>

<p>-w, --column-widths=&lt;width[,width...]&gt; Force each
column width to the provided list, for large terminal
readability.</p>

<p>-t, --field-separator= Use a special separator character
and don t pad with spaces, replacing all occurrences of this
separator in symbol names (and other output) with a .
character, that thus it s the only non valid separator.</p>

<p>-D, --dump-raw-trace Dump raw trace in ASCII.</p>

<p>-g [type,min[,limit],order[,key]], --call-graph Display
call chains using type, min percent threshold, optional
print limit and order. type can be either:</p>

<p>&middot; flat: single column, linear exposure of call
chains.</p>

<p>&middot; graph: use a graph tree, displaying absolute
overhead rates.</p>

<p>&middot; fractal: like graph, but displays relative
rates. Each branch of the tree is considered as a new
profiled object.</p>

<p>order can be either: - callee: callee based call graph.
- caller: inverted caller based call graph.</p>

<p>key can be: - function: compare on functions - address:
compare on individual code addresses</p>

<p>Default: fractal,0.5,callee,function.</p>

<p>--children Accumulate callchain of children to parent
entry so that then can show up in the output. The output
will have a new &quot;Children&quot; column and will be
sorted on the data. It requires callchains are recorded.</p>

<p>--max-stack Set the stack depth limit when parsing the
callchain, anything beyond the specified depth will be
ignored. This is a trade-off between information loss and
faster processing especially for workloads that can have a
very long callchain stack.</p>

<p>Default: 127</p>

<p>-G, --inverted alias for inverted caller based call
graph.</p>

<p>--ignore-callees=&lt;regex&gt; Ignore callees of the
function(s) matching the given regex. This has the effect of
collecting the callers of each such function into one place
in the call-graph tree.</p>

<p>--pretty=&lt;key&gt; Pretty printing style. key: normal,
raw</p>

<p>--stdio Use the stdio interface.</p>

<p>--tui Use the TUI interface, that is integrated with
annotate and allows zooming into DSOs or threads, among
other features. Use of --tui requires a tty, if one is not
present, as when piping to other commands, the stdio
interface is used.</p>

<p>--gtk Use the GTK2 interface.</p>

<p>-k, --vmlinux=&lt;file&gt; vmlinux pathname</p>

<p>--kallsyms=&lt;file&gt; kallsyms pathname</p>

<p>-m, --modules Load module symbols. WARNING: This should
only be used with -k and a LIVE kernel.</p>

<p>-f, --force Dont complain, do it.</p>

<p>--symfs=&lt;directory&gt; Look for files with symbols
relative to this directory.</p>

<p>-C, --cpu Only report samples for the list of CPUs
provided. Multiple CPUs can be provided as a comma-separated
list with no space: 0,1. Ranges of CPUs are specified with
-: 0-2. Default is to report samples on all CPUs.</p>

<p>-M, --disassembler-style= Set disassembler style for
objdump.</p>

<p>--source Interleave source code with assembly code.
Enabled by default, disable with --no-source.</p>

<p>--asm-raw Show raw instruction encoding of assembly
instructions.</p>

<p>--show-total-period Show a column with the sum of
periods.</p>

<p>-I, --show-info Display extended information about the
perf.data file. This adds information which may be very
large and thus may clutter the display. It currently
includes: cpu and numa topology of the host system.</p>

<p>-b, --branch-stack Use the addresses of sampled taken
branches instead of the instruction address to build the
histograms. To generate meaningful output, the perf.data
file must have been obtained using perf record -b or perf
record --branch-filter xxx where xxx is a branch filter
option. perf report is able to auto-detect whether a
perf.data file contains branch stacks and it will
automatically switch to the branch view mode, unless
--no-branch-stack is used.</p>

<p>--objdump=&lt;path&gt; Path to objdump binary.</p>

<p>--group Show event group information together.</p>

<p>--demangle Demangle symbol names to human readable form.
Its enabled by default, disable with --no-demangle.</p>

<p>--mem-mode Use the data addresses of samples in addition
to instruction addresses to build the histograms. To
generate meaningful output, the perf.data file must have
been obtained using perf record -d -W and using a special
event -e cpu/mem-loads/ or -e cpu/mem-stores/. See perf mem
for simpler access.</p>

<p>--percent-limit Do not show entries which have an
overhead under that percent. (Default: 0).</p>

<p>--percentage Determine how to display the overhead
percentage of filtered entries. Filters can be applied by
--comms, --dsos and/or --symbols options and Zoom operations
on the TUI (thread, dso, etc).</p>

<p>&quot;relative&quot; means it&acute;s relative to
filtered entries only so that the sum of shown entries will
be always 100%. &quot;absolute&quot; means it retains the
original value before and after the filter is applied.</p>

<p>--header Show header information in the perf.data file.
This includes various information like hostname, OS and perf
version, cpu/mem info, perf command line, event list and so
on. Currently only --stdio output supports this feature.</p>

<p>--header-only Show only perf.data header (forces
--stdio).</p>
