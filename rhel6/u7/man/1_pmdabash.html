<p>PMDABASH(1) PMDABASH(1)</p>

<p>NAME pmdabash - Bourne-Again SHell trace performance
metrics domain agent</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/bash/pmdabash [-C] [-d domain]
[-l logfile] [-I inter- val] [-t timeout] [-U username]
configfile</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pmdabash is an experimental Performance
Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which exports &quot;xtrace&quot;
events from a traced bash(1) process. This includes the
command execution information that would usually be sent to
standard error with the set -x option to the shell.</p>

<p>Event metrics are exported showing each command
executed, the function name and line number in the script,
and a timestamp. Additionally, the process identifier for
the shell and its parent process are exported.</p>

<p>This requires bash version 4 or later.</p>

<p>A brief description of the pmdabash command line options
follows:</p>

<p>-d It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics
domain num- ber specified here is unique and consistent.
That is, domain should be different for every PMDA on the
one host, and the same domain number should be used for the
same PMDA on all hosts.</p>

<p>-l Location of the log file. By default, a log file
named bash.log is written in the current directory of
pmcd(1) when pmdabash is started, i.e. $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd. If
the log file cannot be cre- ated or is not writable, output
is written to the standard error instead.</p>

<p>-s Amount of time (in seconds) between subsequent
evaluations of the shell trace file descriptor(s). The
default is 2 seconds.</p>

<p>-m Maximum amount of memory to be allowed for each event
queue (one per traced process). The default is 2
megabytes.</p>

<p>-U User account under which to run the agent. The
default is the unprivileged &quot;pcp&quot; account in
current versions of PCP, but in older versions the superuser
account (&quot;root&quot;) was used by default.</p>

<p>INSTALLATION In order for a host to export the names,
help text and values for the bash performance metrics, do
the following as root:</p>

<p># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/bash # ./Install</p>

<p>As soon as an instrumented shell script (see
INSTRUMENTATION selection below) is run, with tracing
enabled, new metric values will appear - no further setup of
the agent is required.</p>

<p>If you want to undo the installation, do the following
as root:</p>

<p># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/bash # ./Remove</p>

<p>pmdabash is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be
executed directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify
pmcd(1) when the agent is installed or removed.</p>

<p>INSTRUMENTATION In order to allow the flow of event data
between a bash(1) script and pmdabash, the script should
take the following actions:</p>

<p>#!/bin/sh source $PCP_DIR/etc/pcp.sh</p>

<p>pcp_trace on $@ # enable tracing echo &quot;awoke,
$count&quot;</p>

<p>pcp_trace off # disable tracing</p>

<p>The tracing can be enabled and disabled any number of
times by the script. On successful installation of the
agent, several metrics will be available:</p>

<p>$ pminfo bash bash.xtrace.numclients bash.xtrace.maxmem
bash.xtrace.queuemem bash.xtrace.count bash.xtrace.records
bash.xtrace.parameters.pid bash.xtrace.parameters.parent
bash.xtrace.parameters.lineno
bash.xtrace.parameters.function
bash.xtrace.parameters.command</p>

<p>When an instrumented script is running, the generation
of event records can be verified using the pmevent(1)
command, as follows:</p>

<p>$ pmevent -t 1 -x bash.xtrace.records host: localhost
samples: all bash.xtrace.records[&quot;4538 ./test-trace.sh

<p>PCP ENVIRONMENT Environment variables with the prefix
PCP_ are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP. On each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in pcp.conf(5).</p>
