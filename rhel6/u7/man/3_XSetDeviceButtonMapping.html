<p>XSETDEVICEBUTTONMAPP(3) XSETDEVICEBUTTONMAPP(3)</p>

<p>NAME XSetDeviceButtonMapping, XGetDeviceButtonMapping -
query or change device button mappings</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;X11/extensions/XInput.h&gt;</p>

<p>int XSetDeviceButtonMapping( Display *display, XDevice
*device, unsigned char map[], int nmap);</p>

<p>int XGetDeviceButtonMapping( Display *display, XDevice
*device, unsigned char map_return[], int nmap);</p>

<p>display Specifies the connection to the X server.</p>

<p>device Specifies the device whose button mapping is to
be queried or changed.</p>

<p>map Specifies the mapping list.</p>

<p>map_return Returns the mapping list.</p>

<p>nmap Specifies the number of items in the mapping
list.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The XSetDeviceButtonMapping request sets the
mapping of the specified device. If it succeeds, the X
server generates a DeviceMappingNotify event, and
XSetDeviceButtonMapping returns MappingSuccess. Element
map[i] defines the logical button number for the physical
button i+1. The length of the list must be the same as
XGetDeviceButtonMapping would return, or a BadValue error
results. A zero element disables a button, and elements are
not restricted in value by the number of physical buttons.
However, no two elements can have the same nonzero value, or
a BadValue error results. If any of the buttons to be
altered are logically in the down state,
XSetDeviceButtonMapping returns MappingBusy, and the mapping
is not changed.</p>

<p>XSetDeviceButtonMapping can generate BadDevice,
BadMatch, and BadValue errors.</p>

<p>The XGetDeviceButtonMapping request returns the current
mapping of the specified device. Buttons are numbered
starting from one.XGetDeviceButtonMapping returns the number
of physical buttons actually on the device. The nominal
mapping for a device is map[i]=i+1. The nmap argument
specifies the length of the array where the device mapping
is returned, and only the first nmap elements are returned
in map_return.</p>

<p>XGetDeviceButtonMapping can generate BadDevice or
BadMatch errors.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS BadDevice An invalid device was specified.
The specified device does not exist or has not been opened
by this client via XOpenInputDevice. This error may also
occur if the specified device is the X keyboard or X pointer
device.</p>

<p>BadMatch This error may occur if an
XGetDeviceButtonMapping or XSetDeviceButtonMapping request
was made specifying a device that has no buttons.</p>

<p>BadValue Some numeric value falls outside the range of
values accepted by the request. Unless a specific range is
specified for an argument, the full range defined by the
argument&rsquo;s type is accepted. Any argument defined as a
set of alternatives can generate this error.</p>
