<p>PCP.CONF(5) PCP.CONF(5)</p>

<p>NAME pcp.conf - the Performance Co-Pilot configuration
and environment file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS /etc/pcp.conf</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION When using Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) tools
and utilities and when calling PCP library functions, a
standard set of environment variables are defined in
/etc/pcp.conf. These variables are generally used to specify
the location of various PCP pieces in the file system and
may be loaded into shell scripts by sourcing the
/etc/pcp.env(5) shell script and queried by C/C++ programs
using the pmGetConfig(3) library function. If a variable is
already defined in the environment, the values in pcp.conf
do not override those values, i.e. the values in pcp.conf
serve as installation defaults only.</p>

<p>Both the pcp.env and pcp.conf files are expected to be
found in /etc by default. If required, the pcp.conf file may
be relocated and PCP_CONF set in the environment to specify
the full path to the new location. The pcp.env file can not
be relocated (this is the only hard coded path required by
PCP).</p>

<p>The syntax rules for pcp.conf are as follows :</p>

<p>1. the general syntax is PCP_VARIABLE_NAME=variable
value to end of line</p>

<p>2. lines that begin with # and all blank lines are
ignored.</p>

<p>3. all variables must be prefixed with PCP_. This is a
security issue - variables that do not have this prefix will
be silently ignored.</p>

<p>4. there should be no space between the variable name
and the literal = and no space between the = and the
variable value (unless the value actually starts with a
space). This is required because the pcp.conf file may be
sourced directly by Makefiles as well as interpreted by the
pcp.env script and the pmGetConfig function.</p>

<p>5. variable values may contain spaces and should not be
quoted. The pcp.env script automatically quotes all variable
values from the character immediately following the =
through to the end of the line.</p>

<p>For further details and an explanation of the use of
each variable, see the comments in the /etc/pcp.conf file
itself.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT The PCP_CONF environment variable specifies
an alternative path to the pcp.conf file.</p>
