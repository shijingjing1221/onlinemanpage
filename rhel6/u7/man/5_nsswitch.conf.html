<p>NSSWITCH.CONF(5) Linux Programmer s Manual
NSSWITCH.CONF(5)</p>

<p>NAME nsswitch.conf - System Databases and Name Service
Switch configuration file</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Various functions in the C Library need to
be configured to work cor- rectly in the local environment.
Traditionally, this was done by using files (e.g.,
/etc/passwd), but other nameservices (like the Network
Information Service (NIS) and the Domain Name Service (DNS))
became popular, and were hacked into the C library, usually
with a fixed search order.</p>

<p>The Linux libc5 with NYS support and the GNU C Library
2.x (libc.so.6) contain a cleaner solution of this problem.
It is designed after a method used by Sun Microsystems in
the C library of Solaris 2. We fol- low their name and call
this scheme &quot;Name Service Switch&quot; (NSS). The
sources for the &quot;databases&quot; and their lookup order
are specified in the /etc/nsswitch.conf file.</p>

<p>The following databases are available in the NSS:</p>

<p>aliases Mail aliases, provides a system-wide mechanism
to redirect mail for local recipients. Used by mail transfer
agents such as Post- fix or sendmail(8). Note: On Linux, not
like on other Unices, Sendmail uses its own aliases
resolution system independent on /etc/nsswitch.conf.</p>

<p>ethers Ethernet numbers.</p>

<p>group Groups of users, used by getgrent(3)
functions.</p>

<p>hosts Host names and numbers, used by gethostbyname(3)
and similar functions.</p>

<p>netgroup Network wide list of hosts and users, used for
access rules. C libraries before glibc 2.1 only support
netgroups over NIS.</p>

<p>networks Network names and numbers, used by getnetent(3)
functions.</p>

<p>passwd User passwords, used by getpwent(3)
functions.</p>

<p>protocols Network protocols, used by getprotoent(3)
functions.</p>

<p>publickey Public and secret keys for Secure_RPC used by
NFS and NIS+.</p>

<p>rpc Remote procedure call names and numbers, used by
getrpcbyname(3) and similar functions.</p>

<p>services Network services, used by getservent(3)
functions.</p>

<p>shadow Shadow user passwords, used by getspnam(3).</p>

<p>An example /etc/nsswitch.conf (namely, the default used
when /etc/nss- witch.conf is missing):</p>

<p>passwd: compat group: compat shadow: compat</p>

<p>hosts: dns [!UNAVAIL=return] files networks: nis
[NOTFOUND=return] files ethers: nis [NOTFOUND=return] files
protocols: nis [NOTFOUND=return] files rpc: nis
[NOTFOUND=return] files services: nis [NOTFOUND=return]
files</p>

<p>The first column is the database. The rest of the line
specifies how the lookup process works. You can specify the
way it works for each database individually.</p>

<p>The configuration specification for each database can
contain two dif- ferent items: * The service specification
like files, db, or nis. * The reaction on lookup result like
[NOTFOUND=return].</p>

<p>For libc5 with NYS, the allowed service specifications
are files, nis, and nisplus. For hosts, you could specify
dns as extra ser- vice, for passwd and group compat, but not
for shadow.</p>

<p>For glibc, you must have a file called
/lib/libnss_SERVICE.so.X for every SERVICE you are using. On
a standard installation, you could use files , db, nis, and
nisplus. For hosts, you could specify dns as extra service,
for passwd, group, and shadow compat . These services will
not be used by libc5 with NYS. The version number X is 1 for
glibc 2.0 and 2 for glibc 2.1.</p>

<p>If System Security Services Daemon (SSSD) is installed
on your system, you can use this service with the sss
keyword. SSSD supports the following databases: passwd,
group, services and netgroup.</p>

<p>The second item in the specification gives the user much
finer control on the lookup process. Action items are placed
between two service names and are written within brackets.
The general form is</p>

<p>[ ( !? STATUS = ACTION )+ ]</p>

<p>where</p>

<p>STATUS =&gt; success | notfound | unavail | tryagain
ACTION =&gt; return | continue</p>

<p>The case of the keywords is insignificant. The STATUS
values are the results of a call to a lookup function of a
specific service. They mean:</p>

<p>success No error occurred and the wanted entry is
returned. The default action for this is return.</p>

<p>notfound The lookup process works ok but the needed
value was not found. The default action is continue .
However, if the selected action for the group database is
return, the next lookup function is always called, without
affecting the search result.</p>

<p>unavail The service is permanently unavailable. This can
either mean the needed file is not available, or, for DNS,
the server is not available or does not allow queries. The
default action is continue.</p>

<p>tryagain The service is temporarily unavailable. This
could mean a file is locked or a server currently cannot
accept more connections. The default action is continue.</p>

<p>Interaction with +/- syntax (compat mode) Linux libc5
without NYS does not have the name service switch but does
allow the user some policy control. In /etc/passwd you could
have entries of the form +user or +@netgroup (include the
specified user from the NIS passwd map), -user or -@netgroup
(exclude the specified user), and + (include every user,
except the excluded ones, from the NIS passwd map). Since
most people only put a + at the end of /etc/passwd to
include everything from NIS, the switch provides a faster
alternative for this case (passwd: files nis) which doesnt
require the single + entry in /etc/passwd, /etc/group, and
/etc/shadow. If this is not sufficient, the NSS compat
service provides full +/- semantics. By default, the source
is nis, but this may be overridden by specifying nisplus as
source for the pseudo-databases passwd_com- pat,
group_compat and shadow_compat. These pseudo-databases are
only available in GNU C Library.</p>

<p>FILES A service named SERVICE is implemented by a shared
object library named libnss_SERVICE.so.X that resides in
/lib.</p>

<p>/etc/nsswitch.conf configuration file
/lib/libnss_compat.so.X implements compat source for glibc2
/lib/libnss_db.so.X implements db source for glibc2
/lib/libnss_dns.so.X implements dns source for glibc2
/lib/libnss_files.so.X implements files source for glibc2
/lib/libnss_hesiod.so.X implements hesiod source for glibc2
/lib/libnss_nis.so.X implements nis source for glibc2
/lib/libnss_nisplus.so.2 implements nisplus source for glibc
2.1</p>

<p>NOTES Within each process that uses nsswitch.conf, the
entire file is read only once; if the file is later changed,
the process will continue using the old configuration.</p>

<p>With Solaris, it isnt possible to link programs using
the NSS Service statically. With Linux, this is no
problem.</p>
