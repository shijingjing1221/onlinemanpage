<p>DESCRIPTION Text2pcap is a program that reads in an
ASCII hex dump and writes the data described into a libpcap
capture file. text2pcap can read hexdumps with multiple
packets in them, and build a capture file of multiple
packets. text2pcap is also capable of generating dummy
Ethernet, IP and UDP, TCP, or SCTP headers, in order to
build fully processable packet dumps from hexdumps of
application-level data only.</p>

<p>Text2pcap understands a hexdump of the form generated by
od -Ax -tx1 -v. In other words, each byte is individually
displayed and surrounded with a space. Each line begins with
an offset describing the position in the file. The offset is
a hex number (can also be octal or decimal - see -o), of
more than two hex digits. Here is a sample dump that
text2pcap can recognize:</p>

<p>000000 00 e0 1e a7 05 6f 00 10 ........ 000008 5a a0 b9
12 08 00 46 00 ........ 000010 03 68 00 00 00 00 0a 2e
........ 000018 ee 33 0f 19 08 7f 0f 19 ........ 000020 03
80 94 04 00 00 10 01 ........ 000028 16 a2 0a 00 03 50 00 0c
........ 000030 01 01 0f 19 03 80 11 01 ........</p>

<p>There is no limit on the width or number of bytes per
line. Also the text dump at the end of the line is ignored.
Bytes/hex numbers can be uppercase or lowercase. Any text
before the offset is ignored, including email forwarding
characters &gt;. Any lines of text between the bytestring
lines is ignored. The offsets are used to track the bytes,
so offsets must be correct. Any line which has only bytes
without a leading offset is ignored. An offset is recognized
as being a hex number longer than two characters. Any text
after the bytes is ignored (e.g. the character dump). Any
hex numbers in this text are also ignored. An offset of zero
is indicative of starting a new packet, so a single text
file with a series of hexdumps can be converted into a
packet capture with multiple packets. Packets may be
preceded by a timestamp. These are interpreted according to
the format given on the command line (see -t). If not, the
first packet is timestamped with the current time the
conversion takes place. Multiple packets are written with
timestamps differing by one microsecond each. In general,
short of these restrictions, text2pcap is pretty liberal
about reading in hexdumps and has been tested with a variety
of mangled outputs (including being forwarded through email
multiple times, with limited line wrap etc.)</p>

<p>There are a couple of other special features to note.
Any line where the first non-whitespace character is # will
be ignored as a comment. Any line beginning with #TEXT2PCAP
is a directive and options can be inserted after this
command to be processed by text2pcap. Currently there are no
directives implemented; in the future, these may be used to
give more fine grained control on the dump and the way it
should be processed e.g. timestamps, encapsulation type
etc.</p>

<p>Text2pcap also allows the user to read in dumps of
application-level data, by inserting dummy L2, L3 and L4
headers before each packet. The user can elect to insert
Ethernet headers, Ethernet and IP, or Ethernet, IP and
UDP/TCP/SCTP headers before each packet. This allows
Wireshark or any other full-packet decoder to handle these
dumps.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -a Enables ASCII text dump identification. It
allows to identify the start of the ASCII text dump and not
include it in the packet even if it looks like HEX.</p>

<p>NOTE: Do not enable it if the input file does not
contain the ASCII text dump.</p>

<p>-d Displays debugging information during the process.
Can be used multiple times to generate more debugging
information.</p>

<p>-e &lt;l3pid&gt; Include a dummy Ethernet header before
each packet. Specify the L3PID for the Ethernet header in
hex. Use this option if your dump has Layer 3 header and
payload (e.g. IP header), but no Layer 2 encapsulation.
Example: -e 0x806 to specify an ARP packet.</p>

<p>For IP packets, instead of generating a fake Ethernet
header you can also use -l 101 to indicate a raw IP packet
to Wireshark. Note that -l 101 does not work for any non-IP
Layer 3 packet (e.g. ARP), whereas generating a dummy
Ethernet header with -e works for any sort of L3 packet.</p>

<p>-h Displays a help message.</p>

<p>-i &lt;proto&gt; Include dummy IP headers before each
packet. Specify the IP protocol for the packet in decimal.
Use this option if your dump is the payload of an IP packet
(i.e. has complete L4 information) but does not have an IP
header with each packet. Note that an appropriate Ethernet
header is automatically included with each packet as well.
Example: -i 46 to specify an RSVP packet (IP protocol
46).</p>

<p>-l Specify the link-layer header type of this packet.
Default is Ethernet (1). See
&lt;http://www.tcpdump.org/linktypes.html&gt; for the
complete list of possible encapsulations. Note that this
option should be used if your dump is a complete hex dump of
an encapsulated packet and you wish to specify the exact
type of encapsulation. Example: -l 7 for ARCNet packets
encapsulated BSD- style.</p>

<p>-m &lt;max-packet&gt; Set the maximum packet length,
default is 64000. Useful for testing various packet
boundaries when only an application level datastream is
available. Example:</p>

<p>od -Ax -tx1 stream | text2pcap -m1460 -T1234,1234 -
stream.pcap</p>

<p>will convert from plain datastream format to a sequence
of Ethernet TCP packets.</p>

<p>-o hex|oct|dec Specify the radix for the offsets (hex,
octal or decimal). Defaults to hex. This corresponds to the
&quot;-A&quot; option for od.</p>

<p>-q Be completely quiet during the process.</p>

<p>-s &lt;srcport&gt;,&lt;destport&gt;,&lt;tag&gt; Include
dummy SCTP headers before each packet. Specify, in decimal,
the source and destination SCTP ports, and verification tag,
for the packet. Use this option if your dump is the SCTP
payload of a packet but does not include any SCTP, IP or
Ethernet headers. Note that appropriate Ethernet and IP
headers are automatically also included with each packet. A
CRC32C checksum will be put into the SCTP header.</p>

<p>-S &lt;srcport&gt;,&lt;destport&gt;,&lt;ppi&gt; Include
dummy SCTP headers before each packet. Specify, in decimal,
the source and destination SCTP ports, and a verification
tag of 0, for the packet, and prepend a dummy SCTP DATA
chunk header with a payload protocol identifier if ppi. Use
this option if your dump is the SCTP payload of a packet but
does not include any SCTP, IP or Ethernet headers. Note that
appropriate Ethernet and IP headers are automatically
included with each packet. A CRC32C checksum will be put
into the SCTP header.</p>

<p>-t &lt;timefmt&gt; Treats the text before the packet as
a date/time code; timefmt is a format string of the sort
supported by strptime(3). Example: The time
&quot;10:15:14.5476&quot; has the format code
&quot;%H:%M:%S.&quot;</p>

<p>NOTE: The subsecond component delimiter must be
specified (.) but no pattern is required; the remaining
number is assumed to be fractions of a second.</p>

<p>NOTE: Date/time fields from the current date/time are
used as the default for unspecified fields.</p>

<p>-T &lt;srcport&gt;,&lt;destport&gt; Include dummy TCP
headers before each packet. Specify the source and
destination TCP ports for the packet in decimal. Use this
option if your dump is the TCP payload of a packet but does
not include any TCP, IP or Ethernet headers. Note that
appropriate Ethernet and IP headers are automatically also
included with each packet. Sequence numbers will start at
0.</p>

<p>-u &lt;srcport&gt;,&lt;destport&gt; Include dummy UDP
headers before each packet. Specify the source and
destination UDP ports for the packet in decimal. Use this
option if your dump is the UDP payload of a packet but does
not include any UDP, IP or Ethernet headers. Note that
appropriate Ethernet and IP headers are automatically also
included with each packet. Example: -u1000,69 to make the
packets look like TFTP/UDP packets.</p>
