<p>NAME nova_compute_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux
Policy for the nova_com- pute processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the
nova_compute processes via flexible mandatory access
control.</p>

<p>The nova_compute processes execute with the
nova_compute_t SELinux type. You can check if you have these
processes running by executing the ps command with the -Z
qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep nova_compute_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The nova_compute_t SELinux type can be
entered via the file_type, unla- beled_t, proc_type,
filesystem_type, mtrr_device_t, sysctl_type,
nova_compute_exec_t file types.</p>

<p>The default entrypoint paths for the nova_compute_t
domain are the fol- lowing:</p>

<p>all files on the system, /dev/cpu/mtrr</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux nova_compute policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their nova_compute processes in as secure a
method as possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for
nova_compute:</p>

<p>nova_compute_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a nova_compute_t can be used
to make the process type nova_compute_t permissive. SELinux
does not deny access to permissive process types, but the
AVC (SELinux denials) messages are still generated.</p>

<p>BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable based on least
access required. nova_compute policy is extremely flexible
and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the
policy and run nova_compute with the tight- est access
possible.</p>

<p>If you want to allow all daemons to write corefiles to
/, you must turn on the allow_daemons_dump_core boolean.
Disabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_daemons_dump_core 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow all daemons to use tcp wrappers,
you must turn on the allow_daemons_use_tcp_wrapper boolean.
Disabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_daemons_use_tcp_wrapper 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow all daemons the ability to
read/write terminals, you must turn on the
allow_daemons_use_tty boolean. Disabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_daemons_use_tty 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow all domains to use other domains
file descriptors, you must turn on the allow_domain_fd_use
boolean. Enabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_domain_fd_use 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow unconfined executables to make
their heap memory executable. Doing this is a really bad
idea. Probably indicates a badly coded executable, but could
indicate an attack. This executable should be reported in
bugzilla, you must turn on the allow_execheap boolean.
Disabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_execheap 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow unconfined executables to map a
memory region as both executable and writable, this is
dangerous and the executable should be reported in
bugzilla), you must turn on the allow_execmem boolean.
Enabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_execmem 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow all unconfined executables to use
libraries requiring text relocation that are not labeled
textrel_shlib_t), you must turn on the allow_execmod
boolean. Enabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_execmod 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow unconfined executables to make
their stack exe- cutable. This should never, ever be
necessary. Probably indicates a badly coded executable, but
could indicate an attack. This executable should be reported
in bugzilla), you must turn on the allow_execstack boolean.
Enabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_execstack 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow sysadm to debug or ptrace all
processes, you must turn on the allow_ptrace boolean.
Disabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_ptrace 1</p>

<p>If you want to enable cluster mode for daemons, you must
turn on the daemons_enable_cluster_mode boolean. Disabled by
default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P daemons_enable_cluster_mode 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow all domains to have the kernel load
modules, you must turn on the domain_kernel_load_modules
boolean. Disabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P domain_kernel_load_modules 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow all domains to execute in
fips_mode, you must turn on the fips_mode boolean. Enabled
by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P fips_mode 1</p>

<p>If you want to enable reading of urandom for all
domains, you must turn on the global_ssp boolean. Disabled
by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P global_ssp 1</p>

<p>If you want to enable support for upstart as the init
program, you must turn on the init_upstart boolean. Enabled
by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P init_upstart 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow certain domains to map low memory
in the kernel, you must turn on the mmap_low_allowed
boolean. Disabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P mmap_low_allowed 1</p>

<p>If you want to boolean to determine whether the system
permits loading policy, setting enforcing mode, and changing
boolean values. Set this to true and you have to reboot to
set it back, you must turn on the secure_mode_policyload
boolean. Disabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P secure_mode_policyload 1</p>

<p>If you want to support X userspace object manager, you
must turn on the xserver_object_manager boolean. Disabled by
default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P xserver_object_manager 1</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type nova_compute_t
can manage files labeled with the following file types. The
paths listed are the default paths for these file types.
Note the processes UID still need to have DAC per-
missions.</p>

<p>file_type</p>

<p>all files on the system</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage boolean can also be used to manipulate the
booleans</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
