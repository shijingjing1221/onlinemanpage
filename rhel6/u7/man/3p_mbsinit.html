<p>MBSINIT(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual MBSINIT(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME mbsinit - determine conversion object status</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;wchar.h&gt;</p>

<p>int mbsinit(const mbstate_t *ps);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION If ps is not a null pointer, the mbsinit()
function shall determine whether the object pointed to by ps
describes an initial conversion state.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The mbsinit() function shall return
non-zero if ps is a null pointer, or if the pointed-to
object describes an initial conversion state; oth- erwise,
it shall return zero.</p>

<p>If an mbstate_t object is altered by any of the
functions described as &quot;restartable&quot;, and is then
used with a different character sequence, or in the other
conversion direction, or with a different LC_CTYPE cate-
gory setting than on earlier function calls, the behavior is
undefined.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The mbstate_t object is used to
describe the current conversion state from a particular
character sequence to a wide-character sequence (or vice
versa) under the rules of a particular setting of the
LC_CTYPE category of the current locale.</p>

<p>The initial conversion state corresponds, for a
conversion in either direction, to the beginning of a new
character sequence in the initial shift state. A zero valued
mbstate_t object is at least one way to describe an initial
conversion state. A zero valued mbstate_t object can be used
to initiate conversion involving any character sequence, in
any LC_CTYPE category setting.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
