<p>sane-st400(5) SANE Scanner Access Now Easy
sane-st400(5)</p>

<p>NAME sane-st400 - SANE backend for Siemens ST/Highscan
flatbed scanners</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sane-st400 library implements a SANE
(Scanner Access Now Easy) backend that provides access to
Siemens ST400 flatbed scanners and com- patibles. At
present, the following scanners are supported by this
backend:</p>

<p>Siemens ST400 (6 bit gray scale) Siemens ST800 (6 bit
gray scale)</p>

<p>The driver supports line art and gray scans up to
8bpp.</p>

<p>The Siemens ST/Highscan series includes several more
models, e.g. the ST300 and ST600. If you own one of these
scanners, or a scanner other than the ones listed above that
works with this backend, please let us know by sending the
scanners model name, SCSI ID, and firmware revi- sion to
sane-devel@lists.alioth.debian.org. Have a look at
http://www.sane-project.org/mailing-lists.html concerning
subscription to sane-devel.</p>

<p>DEVICE NAMES This backend expects device names of the
form:</p>

<p>special</p>

<p>Where special is either the path-name for the special
device that cor- responds to a SCSI scanner. For SCSI
scanners, the special device name must be a generic SCSI
device or a symlink to such a device. Under Linux, such a
device name could be /dev/sga or /dev/sge, for example. See
sane-scsi(5) for details.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION The contents of the st400.conf file is a
list of device names that cor- respond to Siemens scanners.
Empty lines and lines starting with a hash mark (#) are
ignored. A sample configuration file is shown below:</p>

<p>/dev/scanner # this is a comment /dev/sge</p>

<p>The default configuration file that is distributed with
SANE looks like this:</p>

<p>scsi SIEMENS &quot;ST 400&quot; Scanner * * 3 0</p>

<p>In this configuration, the driver can only access the
ST400 model at SCSI ID 3 LUN 0 (see section &quot;BUGS&quot;
below for the reason). To use the driver with other scanner
models, add an appropriate line to the con- figuration file.
For example, to use it with an ST800 at SCSI ID 3 LUN 0, add
the line:</p>

<p>scsi SIEMENS &quot;ST 800&quot; Scanner * * 3 0</p>

<p>FILES /etc/sane.d/st400.conf The backend configuration
file (see also description of SANE_CONFIG_DIR below).</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-st400.a The static library
implementing this backend.</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-st400.so The shared library
implementing this backend (present on systems that support
dynamic loading).</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT SANE_CONFIG_DIR This environment variable
specifies the list of directories that may contain the
configuration file. Under UNIX, the directories are
separated by a colon (:), under OS/2, they are separated by
a semi-colon (;). If this variable is not set, the config-
uration file is searched in two default directories: first,
the current working directory (&quot;.&quot;) and then in
/etc/sane.d. If the value of the environment variable ends
with the directory sepa- rator character, then the default
directories are searched after the explicitly specified
directories. For example, setting SANE_CONFIG_DIR to
&quot;/tmp/config:&quot; would result in directories
&quot;tmp/config&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and
&quot;/etc/sane.d&quot; being searched (in this order).</p>

<p>SANE_DEBUG_ST400 If the library was compiled with debug
support enabled, this environment variable controls the
debug level for this backend. E.g., a value of 128 requests
all debug output to be printed. Smaller levels reduce
verbosity.</p>

<p>MISSING FUNCTIONALITY Everything but the most basic
stuff.</p>

<p>BUGS Currently, the backend does not check if the
attached device really is a ST400. It will happily accept
everything that matches the configura- tion entries. This
makes it easy to test the backend with other scan- ners:
Just add an appropriate line to the configuration file. The
con- figuration file as distributed (see above) only works
with the ST400. Be careful: If there is no config file at
all, the backend defaults to /dev/scanner.</p>

<p>The ST400 answers on all eight SCSI LUNs. Normally this
is not a prob- lem, as LUN support is usually disabled in
SCSI drivers, but if you are seeing multiple instances of
the scanner in a device list, either dis- able LUNs in your
SCSI setup or change the entry in the configuration file to
match LUN 0 only.</p>

<p>DEBUG If you encounter a bug please set the environment
variable SANE_DEBUG_ST400 to 128 and try to regenerate the
problem. Then send me a report with the log attached.</p>

<p>If you encounter a SCSI bus error or trimmed and/or
displaced images please also set the environment variable
SANE_DEBUG_SANEI_SCSI to 128 before sending me the
report.</p>
