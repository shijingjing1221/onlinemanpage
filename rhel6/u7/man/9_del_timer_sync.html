<p>DEL_TIMER_SYNC(9) Driver Basics DEL_TIMER_SYNC(9)</p>

<p>NAME del_timer_sync - deactivate a timer and wait for
the handler to finish.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS int del_timer_sync(struct timer_list *
timer);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS timer the timer to be deactivated</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This function only differs from del_timer on
SMP: besides deactivating the timer it also makes sure the
handler has finished executing on other CPUs.</p>

<p>SYNCHRONIZATION RULES Callers must prevent restarting of
the timer, otherwise this function is meaningless. It must
not be called from interrupt contexts. The caller must not
hold locks which would prevent completion of the
timer&acute;s handler. The timer&acute;s handler must not
call add_timer_on. Upon exit the timer is not queued and the
handler is not running on any CPU.</p>

<p>The function returns whether it has deactivated a
pending timer or not.</p>
