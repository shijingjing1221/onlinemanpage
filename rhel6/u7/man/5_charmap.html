<p>NAME charmap - character symbols to define character
encodings</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION A character set description (charmap)
defines a character set of avail- able characters and their
encodings. All supported character sets should have the
portable character set as a proper subset.</p>

<p>Syntax The charmap file starts with a header, that may
consist of the follow- ing keywords:</p>

<p>&lt;codeset&gt; is followed by the name of the
codeset.</p>

<p>&lt;mb_cur_max&gt; is followed by the max number of
bytes for a multibyte-charac- ter. Multibyte characters are
currently not supported. The default value is 1.</p>

<p>&lt;mb_cur_min&gt; is followed by the min number of
bytes for a character. This value must be less or equal than
mb_cur_max. If not specified, it defaults to mb_cur_max.</p>

<p>&lt;escape_char&gt; is followed by a character that
should be used as the escape- character for the rest of the
file to mark characters that should be interpreted in a
special way. It defaults to the backslash ( ).</p>

<p>&lt;comment_char&gt; is followed by a character that
will be used as the comment- character for the rest of the
file. It defaults to the number sign ( # ).</p>

<p>The charmap-definition itself starts with the keyword
CHARMAP in column 1.</p>

<p>The following lines may have one of the two following
forms to define the character-encodings:</p>

<p>&lt;symbolic-name&gt; &lt;encoding&gt; &lt;comments&gt;
This form defines exactly one character and its
encoding.</p>

<p>&lt;symbolic-name&gt;...&lt;symbolic-name&gt;
&lt;encoding&gt; &lt;comments&gt; This form defines a couple
of characters. This is only useful for multibyte-characters,
which are currently not implemented.</p>

<p>The last line in a charmap-definition file must contain
END CHARMAP.</p>

<p>Symbolic Names A symbolic name for a character contains
only characters of the portable character set. The name
itself is enclosed between angle brackets. Characters
following an &lt;escape_char&gt; are interpreted as itself;
for example, the sequence &gt;&gt; represents the symbolic
name &gt; enclosed in angle brackets.</p>

<p>Character Encoding The encoding may be in each of the
following three forms:</p>

<p>&lt;escape_char&gt;d&lt;number&gt; with a decimal
number</p>

<p>&lt;escape_char&gt;x&lt;number&gt; with a hexadecimal
number</p>

<p>&lt;escape_char&gt;&lt;number&gt; with an octal
number.</p>

<p>FILES /usr/share/i18n/charmaps/*</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO POSIX.2.</p>
