<p>LZOP(1) LZOP(1)</p>

<p>NAME lzop - compress or expand files</p>

<p>ABSTRACT lzop is a file compressor very similar to gzip.
lzop favors speed over compression ratio.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS lzop [ command ] [ options ] [ filename ...
]</p>

<p>lzop [-dxlthIVL19] [-qvcfFnNPkU] [-o file] [-p[path]]
[-S suffix] [filename ...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION lzop reduces the size of the named files.
Whenever possible, each file is compressed into one with the
extension .lzo, while keeping the same ownership modes,
access and modification times. If no files are speci- fied,
or if a file name is &quot;-&quot;, lzop tries to compress
the standard input to the standard output. lzop will only
attempt to compress regu- lar files or symbolic links to
regular files. In particular, it will ignore
directories.</p>

<p>If the compressed file name is too long for its file
system, lzop trun- cates it.</p>

<p>Compressed files can be restored to their original form
using lzop -d. lzop -d takes a list of files on its command
line and decompresses each file whose name ends with .lzo
and which begins with the correct magic number to an
uncompressed file without the original extension. lzop -d
also recognizes the special extension .tzo as shorthand for
.tar.lzo. When compressing, lzop uses the .tzo extension if
necessary instead of truncating a file with a .tar
extension.</p>

<p>lzop stores the original file name, mode and time stamp
in the com- pressed file. These can be used when
decompressing the file with the -d option. This is useful
when the compressed file name was truncated or when the time
stamp was not preserved after a file transfer.</p>

<p>lzop preserves the ownership, mode and time stamp of
files when com- pressing. When decompressing lzop restores
the mode and time stamp if present in the compressed files.
See the options -n, -N, --no-mode and --no-time for more
information.</p>

<p>lzop always keeps original files unchanged unless you
use the option -U.</p>

<p>lzop uses the LZO data compression library for
compression services. The amount of compression obtained
depends on the size of the input and the distribution of
common substrings. Typically, text such as source code or
English is compressed into 40-50% of the original size, and
large files usually compress much better than small ones.
Compression and decompression speed is generally much faster
than that achieved by gzip, but compression ratio is
worse.</p>

<p>COMPRESSION LEVELS</p>

<p>lzop offers the following compression levels of the
LZO1X algorithm:</p>

<p>-3 the default level offers pretty fast compression. -2,
-3, -4, -5 and -6 are currently all equivalent - this may
change in a future release.</p>

<p>-1, --fast can be even a little bit faster in some cases
- but most times you wont notice the difference</p>

<p>-7, -8, -9, --best these compression levels are mainly
intended for generating pre- compressed data - especially -9
can be somewhat slow</p>

<p>Decompression is very fast for all compression levels,
and decompres- sion speed is not affected by the compression
level.</p>

<p>MAIN COMMAND If no other command is given then lzop
defaults to compression (using compression level -3).</p>

<p>-#, --fast, --best Regulate the speed of compression
using the specified digit #, where -1 or --fast indicates
the fastest compression method (less compression) and -9 or
--best indicates the slowest compression method (best
compression). The default compression level is -3.</p>

<p>-d, --decompress, --uncompress Decompress. Each file
will be placed into same the directory as the compressed
file.</p>

<p>-x, --extract Extract compressed files to the current
working directory. This is the same as -dPp.</p>

<p>-t, --test Test. Check the compressed file
integrity.</p>

<p>-l, --list For each compressed file, list the following
fields:</p>

<p>method: compression method compressed: size of the
compressed file uncompr.: size of the uncompressed file
ratio: compression ratio uncompressed_name: name of the
uncompressed file</p>

<p>In combination with the --verbose option, the following
fields are also displayed:</p>

<p>date &amp; time: time stamp for the uncompressed
file</p>

<p>With --name, the uncompressed name, date and time are
those stored within the compress file if present.</p>

<p>With --verbose, the size totals and compression ratio
for all files is also displayed. With --quiet, the title and
totals lines are not displayed.</p>

<p>Note that lzop defines compression ratio as
compressed_size / uncompressed_size.</p>

<p>--ls, --ls=FLAGS List each compressed file in a format
similar to ls -ln.</p>

<p>The following flags are currently honoured: F Append a *
for executable files. G Inhibit display of group
information. Q Enclose file names in double quotes.</p>

<p>--info For each compressed file, list the internal
header fields.</p>

<p>-I, --sysinfo Display information about the system and
quit.</p>

<p>-L, --license Display the lzop license and quit.</p>

<p>-h, -H, --help Display a help screen and quit.</p>

<p>-V Version. Display the version number and compilation
options and quit.</p>

<p>--version Version. Display the version number and
quit.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -c, --stdout, --to-stdout Write output on
standard output. If there are several input files, the
output consists of a sequence of independently
(de)compressed members. To obtain better compression,
concatenate all input files before compressing them.</p>

<p>-o FILE, --output=FILE Write output to the file FILE. If
there are several input files, the output consists of a
sequence of independently (de)compressed members.</p>

<p>-p, -pDIR, --path=DIR Write output files into the
directory DIR instead of the directory determined by the
input file. If DIR is omitted, then write to the current
working directory.</p>

<p>-f, --force Force lzop to</p>

<p>- overwrite existing files - (de-)compress from stdin
even if it seems a terminal - (de-)compress to stdout even
if it seems a terminal - allow option -c in combination with
-U</p>

<p>Using -f two or more times forces things like</p>

<p>- compress files that already have a .lzo suffix - try
to decompress files that do not have a valid suffix - try to
handle compressed files with unknown header flags</p>

<p>Use with care.</p>

<p>-F, --no-checksum Do not store or verify a checksum of
the uncompressed file when compressing or decompressing.
This speeds up the operation of lzop a little bit
(especially when decompressing), but as unnoticed data
corruption can happen in case of damaged compressed files
the usage of this option is not generally recommended. Also,
a checksum is always stored when compressing with one of the
slow compression levels (-7, -8 or -9), regardless of this
option.</p>

<p>-n, --no-name When decompressing, do not restore the
original file name if present (remove only the lzop suffix
from the compressed file name). This option is the default
under UNIX.</p>

<p>-N, --name When decompressing, restore the original file
name if present. This option is useful on systems which have
a limit on file name length. If the original name saved in
the compressed file is not suitable for its file system, a
new name is constructed from the original one to make it
legal. This option is the default under DOS, Win- dows and
OS/2.</p>

<p>-P When decompressing, restore the original path and
file name if present. When compressing, store the relative
(and cleaned) path name. This option is mainly useful when
using archive mode - see usage examples below.</p>

<p>--no-mode When decompressing, do not restore the
original mode (permissions) saved in the compressed
file.</p>

<p>--no-time When decompressing, do not restore the
original time stamp saved in the compressed file.</p>

<p>-S .suf, --suffix=.suf Use suffix .suf instead of .lzo.
The suffix must not contain multi- ple dots and special
characters like + or * , and suffixes other than .lzo should
be avoided to avoid confusion when files are transferred to
other systems.</p>

<p>-k, --keep Do not delete input files. This is the
default.</p>

<p>-U, --unlink, --delete Delete input files after
succesfull compression or decompression. Use this option to
make lzop behave like gzip and bzip2. Note that explicitly
giving -k overrides -U.</p>

<p>--crc32 Use a crc32 checksum instead of a adler32
checksum.</p>

<p>--no-warn Suppress all warnings.</p>

<p>--ignore-warn Suppress all warnings, and never exit with
exit status 2.</p>

<p>-q, --quiet, --silent Suppress all warnings and decrease
the verbosity of some commands like --list or --test.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose Verbose. Display the name for each file
compressed or decompressed. Multiple -v can be used to
increase the verbosity of some commands like --list or
--test.</p>

<p>-- Specifies that this is the end of the options. Any
file name after -- will not be interpreted as an option even
if it starts with a hyphen.</p>

<p>OTHER OPTIONS --no-stdin Do not try to read standard
input (but a file name &quot;-&quot; will still override
this option). In old versions of lzop, this option was
necessary when used in cron jobs (which do not have a
controlling terminal).</p>

<p>--filter=NUMBER Rarely useful. Preprocess data with a
special &quot;multimedia&quot; filter before compressing in
order to improve compression ratio. NUMBER must be a decimal
number from 1 to 16, inclusive. Using a filter slows down
both compression and decompression quite a bit, and the
compression ratio usually doesn t improve much either...
More effective filters may be added in the future,
though.</p>

<p>You can try --filter=1 with data like 8-bit sound
samples, --fil- ter=2 with 16-bit samples or depth-16
images, etc.</p>

<p>Un-filtering during decompression is handled
automatically.</p>

<p>-C, --checksum Deprecated. Only for compatibility with
very old versions as lzop now uses a checksum by default.
This option will get removed in a future release.</p>

<p>--no-color Do not use any color escape sequences.</p>

<p>--mono Assume a mono ANSI terminal. This is the default
under UNIX (if console support is compiled in).</p>

<p>--color Assume a color ANSI terminal or try full-screen
access. This is the default under DOS and in a Linux virtual
console (if console sup- port is compiled in).</p>

<p>ADVANCED USAGE lzop allows you to deal with your files
in many flexible ways. Here are some usage examples:</p>

<p>backup mode tar --use-compress-program=lzop -cf
archive.tar.lzo files..</p>

<p>This is the recommended mode for creating backups.
Requires GNU tar or a compatible version which accepts the
--use-compress-program=XXX option.</p>

<p>single file mode: individually (de)compress each file
create lzop a.c -&gt; create a.c.lzo lzop a.c b.c -&gt;
create a.c.lzo &amp; b.c.lzo lzop -U a.c b.c -&gt; create
a.c.lzo &amp; b.c.lzo and delete a.c &amp; b.c lzop *.c</p>

<p>extract lzop -d a.c.lzo -&gt; restore a.c lzop -df
a.c.lzo -&gt; restore a.c, overwrite if already exists lzop
-d *.lzo</p>

<p>list lzop -l a.c.lzo lzop -l *.lzo lzop -lv *.lzo -&gt;
be verbose</p>

<p>test lzop -t a.c.lzo lzop -tq *.lzo -&gt; be quiet</p>

<p>pipe mode: (de)compress from stdin to stdout create lzop
&lt; a.c &gt; y.lzo cat a.c lzop &gt; y.lzo tar -cf - *.c
lzop &gt; y.tar.lzo -&gt; create a compressed tar file</p>

<p>extract lzop -d &lt; y.lzo &gt; a.c lzop -d &lt;
y.tar.lzo tar -xvf - -&gt; extract a tar file</p>

<p>list lzop -l &lt; y.lzo cat y.lzo lzop -l lzop -d &lt;
y.tar.lzo tar -tvf - -&gt; list a tar file</p>

<p>test lzop -t &lt; y.lzo cat y.lzo lzop -t</p>

<p>stdout mode: (de)compress to stdout create lzop -c a.c
&gt; y.lzo</p>

<p>extract lzop -dc y.lzo &gt; a.c lzop -dc y.tar.lzo tar
-xvf - -&gt; extract a tar file</p>

<p>list lzop -dc y.tar.lzo tar -tvf - -&gt; list a tar
file</p>

<p>archive mode: compress/extract multiple files into a
single archive file create lzop a.c b.c -o sources.lzo -&gt;
create an archive lzop -P src/*.c -o sources.lzo -&gt;
create an archive, store path name lzop -c *.c &gt;
sources.lzo -&gt; another way to create an archive lzop -c
*.h &gt;&gt; sources.lzo -&gt; add files to archive</p>

<p>extract lzop -dN sources.lzo lzop -x ../src/sources.lzo
-&gt; extract to current directory lzop -x -p/tmp &lt;
../src/sources.lzo -&gt; extract to /tmp directory</p>

<p>list lzop -lNv sources.lzo</p>

<p>test lzop -t sources.lzo lzop -tvv sources.lzo -&gt; be
very verbose</p>

<p>If you wish to create a single archive file with
multiple members so that members can later be extracted
independently, you should prefer a full-featured archiver
such as tar. The latest version of GNU tar sup- ports the
--use-compress-program=lzop option to invoke lzop transpar-
ently. lzop is designed as a complement to tar, not as a
replacement.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT The environment variable LZOP can hold a set
of default options for lzop. These options are interpreted
first and can be overwritten by explicit command line
parameters. For example:</p>

<p>for sh/ksh/zsh: LZOP=&quot;-1v --name&quot;; export LZOP
for csh/tcsh: setenv LZOP &quot;-1v --name&quot; for
DOS/Windows: set LZOP=-1v --name</p>

<p>On Vax/VMS, the name of the environment variable is
LZOP_OPT, to avoid a conflict with the symbol set for
invocation of the program.</p>

<p>Not all of the options are valid in the environment
variable - lzop will tell you.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO bzip2(1), gzip(1), tar(1)</p>

<p>Precompiled binaries for some platforms are available
from the lzop home page.</p>

<p>see http://www.oberhumer.com/opensource/lzop/</p>

<p>lzop uses the LZO data compression library for
compression services.</p>

<p>see http://www.oberhumer.com/opensource/lzo/</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS Exit status is normally 0; if an error
occurs, exit status is 1. If a warning occurs, exit status
is 2 (unless option --ignore-warn is in effect).</p>

<p>lzos diagnostics are intended to be
self-explanatory.</p>
