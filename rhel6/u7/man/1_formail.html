<p>NAME formail - mail (re)formatter</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS formail [+skip] [-total] [-bczfrktedqBY] [-p
prefix] [-D maxlen idcache] [-l folder] [-x headerfield] [-X
headerfield] [-a headerfield] [-A headerfield] [-i
headerfield] [-I headerfield] [-u headerfield] [-U
headerfield] [-R oldfield newfield] [-n [maxprocs ]] [-m
minfields] [-s [command [arg ...]]] formail -v</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION formail is a filter that can be used to
force mail into mailbox format, perform From escaping,
generate auto-replying headers, do simple header
munging/extracting or split up a mailbox/digest/articles
file. The mail/mailbox/article contents will be expected on
stdin.</p>

<p>If formail is supposed to determine the sender of the
mail, but is unable to find any, it will substitute
foo@bar.</p>

<p>If formail is started without any command line options,
it will force any mail coming from stdin into mailbox format
and will escape all bogus From lines with a &gt;.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -v Formail will print its version number and
exit.</p>

<p>-b Dont escape any bogus mailbox headers (i.e., lines
starting with From ).</p>

<p>-p prefix Define a different quotation prefix. If
unspecified it defaults to &gt;.</p>

<p>-Y Assume traditional Berkeley mailbox format, ignoring
any Content- Length: fields.</p>

<p>-c Concatenate continued fields in the header. Might be
convenient when postprocessing mail with standard (line
oriented) text utili- ties.</p>

<p>-z Ensure a whitespace exists between field name and
content. Zap fields which contain only a single whitespace
character. Zap leading and trailing whitespace on fields
extracted with -x.</p>

<p>-f Force formail to simply pass along any non-mailbox
format (i.e., dont generate a From line as the first
line).</p>

<p>-r Generate an auto-reply header. This will normally
throw away all the existing fields (except X-Loop:) in the
original message, fields you wish to preserve need to be
named using the -i option. If you use this option in
conjunction with -k, you can prevent the body from being
escaped by also specifying -b.</p>

<p>-k When generating the auto-reply header or when
extracting fields, keep the body as well.</p>

<p>-t Trust the sender to have used a valid return address
in his header. This causes formail to select the header
sender instead of the envelope sender for the reply. This
option should be used when generating auto-reply headers
from news articles or when the sender of the message is
expecting a reply.</p>

<p>-s The input will be split up into separate mail
messages, and piped into a program one by one (a new program
is started for every part). -s has to be the last option
specified, the first argument following it is expected to be
the name of a program, any other arguments will be passed
along to it. If you omit the program, then formail will
simply concatenate the split mails on stdout again. See
FILENO.</p>

<p>-n [maxprocs] Tell formail not to wait for every program
to finish before start- ing the next (causes splits to be
processed in parallel). Max- procs optionally specifies an
upper limit on the number of concur- rently running
processes.</p>

<p>-e Do not require empty lines to be preceding the header
of a new message (i.e., the messages could start on every
line).</p>

<p>-d Tell formail that the messages it is supposed to
split need not be in strict mailbox format (i.e., allows you
to split digests/arti- cles or non-standard mailbox
formats). This disables recognition of the Content-Length:
field.</p>

<p>-l folder Generate a log summary in the same style as
procmail. This includes the entire &quot;From &quot; line,
the Subject: header field, the folder, and the size of the
message in bytes. The mailstat com- mand can be used to
summarize logs in this format.</p>

<p>-B Makes formail assume that it is splitting up a BABYL
rmail file.</p>

<p>-m minfields Allows you to specify the number of
consecutive headerfields for- mail needs to find before it
decides it found the start of a new message, it defaults to
2.</p>

<p>-q Tells formail to (still detect but) be quiet about
write errors, duplicate messages and mismatched
Content-Length: fields. This option is on by default, to
make it display the messages use -q-.</p>

<p>-D maxlen idcache Formail will detect if the Message-ID
of the current message has already been seen using an
idcache file of approximately maxlen size. If not splitting,
it will return success if a duplicate has been found. If
splitting, it will not output duplicate messages. If used in
conjunction with -r, formail will look at the mail address
of the envelope sender instead at the Message-ID.</p>

<p>-x headerfield Extract the contents of this headerfield
from the header. Line continuations will be left intact; if
you want the value on a sin- gle line then youll also need
the -c option.</p>

<p>-X headerfield Same as -x, but also preserves/includes
the field name.</p>

<p>-a headerfield Append a custom headerfield onto the
header; but only if a similar field does not exist yet. If
you specify either one of the field names Message-ID: or
Resent-Message-ID: with no field contents, then formail will
generate a unique message-ID for you.</p>

<p>-A headerfield Append a custom headerfield onto the
header in any case.</p>

<p>-i headerfield Same as -A, except that any existing
similar fields are renamed by prepending an Old- prefix. If
headerfield consists only of a field-name, it will not be
appended.</p>

<p>-I headerfield Same as -i, except that any existing
similar fields are simply removed. If headerfield consists
only of a field-name, it effec- tively deletes the
field.</p>

<p>-u headerfield Make the first occurrence of this field
unique, and thus delete all subsequent occurrences of
it.</p>

<p>-U headerfield Make the last occurrence of this field
unique, and thus delete all preceding occurrences of it.</p>

<p>-R oldfield newfield Renames all occurrences of the
fieldname oldfield into newfield.</p>

<p>+skip Skip the first skip messages while splitting.</p>

<p>-total Output at most total messages while
splitting.</p>

<p>NOTES When renaming, removing, or extracting fields,
partial fieldnames may be used to specify all fields that
start with the specified value.</p>

<p>By default, when generating an auto-reply header
procmail selects the envelope sender from the input message.
This is correct for vacation messages and other automatic
replies regarding the routing or delivery of the original
message. If the sender is expecting a reply or the reply is
being generated in response to the contents of the original
message then the -t option should be used.</p>

<p>RFC822, the original standard governing the format of
Internet mail messages, did not specify whether Resent
header fields (those that begin with Resent- , such as
Resent-From:) should be considered when generating a reply.
Since then, the recommended usage of the Resent headers has
evolved to consider them as purely informational and not for
use when generating a reply. This has been codified in
RFC2822, the new Internet Message Format standard, which
states in part:</p>

<p>Resent fields are used to identify a message as having
been reintroduced into the transport system by a user. The
purpose of using resent fields is to have the message appear
to the final recipient as if it were sent directly by the
original sender, with all of the original fields remaining
the same....They MUST NOT be used in the normal processing
of replies or other such automatic actions on messages.</p>

<p>While formail now ignores Resent headers when generating
header replies, versions of formail prior to 3.14 gave such
headers a high precedence. If the old behavior is needed for
established applications it can be specified by calling
formail with the option -a Resent- in addition to the -r and
-t options. This usage is deprecated and should not be used
in new applications.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT FILENO While splitting, formail assigns the
message number currently being output to this variable. By
presetting FILENO, you can change the initial message number
being used and the width of the zero-padded output. If
FILENO is unset it will default to 000. If FILENO is
non-empty and does not contain a number, FILENO generation
is disabled.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES To split up a digest one usually uses: formail
+1 -ds &gt;&gt;the_mailbox_of_your_choice or formail +1 -ds
procmail</p>

<p>To remove all Received: fields from the header: formail
-I Received:</p>

<p>To remove all fields except From: and Subject: from the
header: formail -k -X From: -X Subject:</p>

<p>To supersede the Reply-To: field in a header you could
use: formail -i &quot;Reply-To: foo@bar&quot;</p>

<p>To convert a non-standard mailbox file into a standard
mailbox file you can use: formail -ds &lt;old_mailbox
&gt;&gt;new_mailbox</p>

<p>Or, if you have a very tolerant mailer: formail -a Date:
-ds &lt;old_mailbox &gt;&gt;new_mailbox</p>

<p>To extract the header from a message: formail -X
&quot;&quot; or sed -e /^$/ q</p>

<p>To extract the body from a message: formail -I
&quot;&quot; or sed -e 1,/^$/ d</p>

<p>SEE ALSO mail(1), binmail(1), sendmail(8), procmail(1),
sed(1), sh(1), RFC822, RFC2822, RFC1123</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS Can t fork Too many processes on this
machine.</p>

<p>Content-Length: field exceeds actual length by nnn bytes
The Content-Length: field in the header speci- fied a length
that was longer than the actual body. This causes this
message to absorb a num- ber of subsequent messages
following it in the same mailbox.</p>

<p>Couldnt write to stdout The program that formail was
trying to pipe into didn t accept all the data formail sent
to it; this diagnostic can be suppressed by the -q op-
tion.</p>

<p>Duplicate key found: x The Message-ID or sender x in
this message was found in the idcache; this diagnostic can
be suppressed by the -q option.</p>

<p>Failed to execute &quot;x&quot; Program not in path, or
not executable.</p>

<p>File table full Too many open files on this machine.</p>

<p>Invalid field-name: &quot;x&quot; The specified
field-name &quot;x&quot; contains control characters, or
cannot be a partial field-name for this option.</p>

<p>WARNINGS You can save yourself and others a lot of grief
if you try to avoid us- ing this autoreply feature on mails
coming through mailinglists. De- pending on the format of
the incoming mail (which in turn depends on both the
original senders mail agent and the mailinglist setup) for-
mail could decide to generate an autoreply header that
replies to the list.</p>

<p>In the tradition of UN*X utilities, formail will do
exactly what you ask it to, even if it results in a
non-RFC822 compliant message. In particular, formail will
let you generate header fields whose name ends in a space
instead of a colon. While this is correct for the leading
From line, that line is not a header field so much as the
message separator for the mbox mailbox format. Multiple
occurrences of such a line or any other colonless header
field will be considered by many mail programs, including
formail itself, as the beginning of a new mes- sage. Others
will consider the message to be corrupt. Because of this,
you should not use the -i option with the From line as the
re- sulting renamed line, Old-From , will probably not do
what you want it to. If you want to save the original From
line, rename it with the -R option to a legal header field
such as X-From_:.</p>

<p>BUGS When formail has to generate a leading From line it
normally will contain the current date. If formail is given
the option -a Date:, it will use the date from the Date:
field in the header (if present). However, since formail
copies it verbatim, the format will differ from that
expected by most mail readers.</p>

<p>If formail is instructed to delete or rename the leading
From line, it will not automatically regenerate it as usual.
To force formail to regenerate it in this case, include
-aFrom.</p>

<p>If formail is not called as the first program in a pipe
and it is told to split up the input in several messages,
then formail will not termi- nate until the program it
receives the input from closes its output or terminates
itself.</p>

<p>If formail is instructed to generate an autoreply mail,
it will never put more than one address in the To:
field.</p>

<p>MISCELLANEOUS Formail is eight-bit clean.</p>

<p>When formail has to determine the senders address, every
RFC822 con- forming mail address is allowed. Formail will
always strip down the address to its minimal form (deleting
excessive comments and whites- pace).</p>

<p>The regular expression that is used to find real
postmarks is: &quot;0rom [ ]*[^]+[ ]+[^ ]&quot;</p>

<p>If a Content-Length: field is found in a header, formail
will copy the number of specified bytes in the body verbatim
before resuming the reg- ular scanning for message
boundaries (except when splitting digests or Berkeley
mailbox format is assumed).</p>

<p>Any header lines immediately following the leading From
line that start with &gt;From are considered to be a
continuation of the From line. If instructed to rename the
From line, formail will change each leading &gt; into a
space, thereby transforming those lines into normal RFC822
continuations.</p>

<p>NOTES Calling up formail with the -h or -? options will
cause it to display a command-line help page.</p>
