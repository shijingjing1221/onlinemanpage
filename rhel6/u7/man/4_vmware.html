<p>NAME vmware - VMware SVGA video driver</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS Section &quot;Device&quot; Identifier
&quot;devname&quot; Driver &quot;vmware&quot; ...
EndSection</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION vmware is an Xorg driver for VMware virtual
video cards.</p>

<p>MODESETTING, XINERAMA AND RANDR12 If the driver can
connect to the &quot;vmwgfx&quot; kernel module on linux, it
will attempt to use kernel modesetting and will then also
use RandR12 for multiple output operation instead of
Xinerama. The X server log or the &quot;xrandr&quot;
application can be used to determine whether RandR12 or
Xinerama is actually used.</p>

<p>3D ACCELERATION If the driver can connect to the
&quot;vmwgfx&quot; kernel module on linux, and the Virtual
Machine is set up to use 3D acceleration, the driver will
try to use Gallium3D XA to accelerate 3D operations. It will
also by default enable DRI, the Direct Rendering
Infrastructure, primarily for accelerated OpenGL. If 3D
acceleration is available, the driver will in addition
provide an additional XVideo adaptor for textured video.
Gallium3D XA,ibxatracker.so&quot; and the accelerated OpenGL
driver, &quot;vmwgfx_dri.so&quot; is provided by the mesa
distribution.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION DETAILS Please refer to xorg.conf(5) for
general configuration details. This section only covers
configuration details specific to this driver.</p>

<p>The driver auto-detects the version of any virtual
VMware SVGA adapter.</p>

<p>The following driver Options are supported:</p>

<p>Option &quot;HWCursor&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Enable
or disable the HW cursor. Default: off.</p>

<p>Option &quot;Xinerama&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Disable
or enable Xinerama support. Default: xinerama is enabled if
the hardware supports it.</p>

<p>Option &quot;StaticXinerama&quot; &quot;string&quot;
Provide a static xinerama geometry that will be active at
server startup and will not be overridden at runtime. The
format is
&quot;Width1xHeight1+Xoffset1+Yoffset1;Width2xHeight2+Xoffset2+Yoff-
set2&quot; and so on. Negative offsets are not supported. If
the driver is using RandR12, this option should be used to
place and enable outputs at driver startup time or else when
VMware tools is not used for that purpose. Also please see
option &quot;GuiLay- out&quot;.</p>

<p>Option &quot;GuiLayout&quot; &quot;string&quot; A
synonym to option &quot;StaticXinerama&quot;, since the
latter name is somewhat misleading when RandR12 is favoured
before Xinerarma.</p>

<p>Option &quot;AddDefaultMode&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
Provide a default mode with a resolution identical to the
reso- lution of the guest before the X server was started.
The X server will thus try to start without changing
resolution. Default: on.</p>

<p>Option &quot;RenderAccel&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Try
to accelerate render operations if the operations are read-
ing from previously accelerated contents (3D or video). This
option is needed for 3D support. Default: on if 3D
acceleration is supported. Otherwise off.</p>

<p>Option &quot;DRI&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Enable the
Direct Rendering Infrastructure. Default: on if 3D
acceleration is supported and &quot;RenderAccel&quot; is
enabled. Other- wise off.</p>

<p>Option &quot;DirectPresents&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
Speed up OpenGL swapbuffers by skipping a copy operation.
This provides some OpenGL swapbuffer speedups, but may cause
perfor- mance degradation and rendering errors when 3D
contents is read back for mixing with software rendered
contents. Default: off.</p>

<p>Option &quot;HwPresents&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; This
is a developer convenience option and should not be used by
distros or normal users. When enabled, it copies software
ren- dered contents to a 3D surface before presenting it, so
that the visible screen is always present on a 3D surface.
Default: off.</p>

<p>Option &quot;RenderCheck&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; This
is a developer convenience option and should not be used by
distros or normal users. When enabled, it tries to use 3D
accel- eration for all XRender operations where 3D
acceleration is sup- ported, resulting in a considerable
slowdown due to the increased number of readbacks of
accelerated contents from host to guest. This option is used
to verify that the accelerated Xrender paths works correctly
with the &quot;rendercheck&quot; applica- tion. Default:
off.</p>
