<p>XINIT(1) XINIT(1)</p>

<p>NAME xinit - X Window System initializer</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS xinit [ [ client ] options ... ] [ -- [ server
] [ display ] options ... ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The xinit program is used to start the X
Window System server and a first client program on systems
that cannot start X directly from /etc/init or in
environments that use multiple window systems. When this
first client exits, xinit will kill the X server and then
termi- nate.</p>

<p>If no specific client program is given on the command
line, xinit will look for a file in the user s home
directory called .xinitrc to run as a shell script to start
up client programs. If no such file exists, xinit will use
the following as a default:</p>

<p>xterm -geometry +1+1 -n login -display :0</p>

<p>If no specific server program is given on the command
line, xinit will look for a file in the user s home
directory called .xserverrc to run as a shell script to
start up the server. If no such file exists, xinit will use
the following as a default:</p>

<p>X :0</p>

<p>Note that this assumes that there is a program named X
in the current search path. However, servers are usually
named Xdisplaytype where displaytype is the type of graphics
display which is driven by this server. The site
administrator should, therefore, make a link to the
appropriate type of server on the machine, or create a shell
script that runs xinit with the appropriate server.</p>

<p>Note, when using a .xserverrc script be sure to exec the
real X server. Failing to do this can make the X server slow
to start and exit. For example:</p>

<p>exec Xdisplaytype</p>

<p>An important point is that programs which are run by
.xinitrc should be run in the background if they do not exit
right away, so that they dont prevent other programs from
starting up. However, the last long- lived program started
(usually a window manager or terminal emulator) should be
left in the foreground so that the script wont exit (which
indicates that the user is done and that xinit should
exit).</p>

<p>An alternate client and/or server may be specified on
the command line. The desired client program and its
arguments should be given as the first command line
arguments to xinit. To specify a particular server command
line, append a double dash (--) to the xinit command line
(after any client and arguments) followed by the desired
server com- mand.</p>

<p>Both the client program name and the server program name
must begin with a slash (/) or a period (.). Otherwise, they
are treated as an arguments to be appended to their
respective startup lines. This makes it possible to add
arguments (for example, foreground and background colors)
without having to retype the whole command line.</p>

<p>If an explicit server name is not given and the first
argument follow- ing the double dash (--) is a colon
followed by a digit, xinit will use that number as the
display number instead of zero. All remaining argu- ments
are appended to the server command line.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Below are several examples of how command line
arguments in xinit are used.</p>

<p>xinit This will start up a server named X and run the
users .xini- trc, if it exists, or else start an xterm.</p>

<p>xinit -- /usr/local/bin/Xqdss :1 This is how one could
start a specific type of server on an alternate display.</p>

<p>xinit -geometry =80x65+10+10 -fn 8x13 -j -fg white -bg
navy This will start up a server named X, and will append
the given arguments to the default xterm command. It will
ignore .xini- trc.</p>

<p>xinit -e widgets -- ./Xsun -l -c This will use the
command .Xsun -l -c to start the server and will append the
arguments -e widgets to the default xterm com- mand.</p>

<p>xinit /usr/ucb/rsh fasthost cpupig -display ws:1 -- :1
-a 2 -t 5 This will start a server named X on display 1 with
the argu- ments -a 2 -t 5. It will then start a remote shell
on the machine fasthost in which it will run the command
cpupig, telling it to display back on the local
workstation.</p>

<p>Below is a sample .xinitrc that starts a clock, several
terminals, and leaves the window manager running as the last
application. Assum- ing that the window manager has been
configured properly, the user then chooses the Exit menu
item to shut down X.</p>

<p>xrdb -load $HOME/.Xresources xsetroot -solid gray &amp;
xclock -g 50x50-0+0 -bw 0 &amp; xload -g 50x50-50+0 -bw 0
&amp; xterm -g 80x24+0+0 &amp; xterm -g 80x24+0-0 &amp;
twm</p>

<p>Sites that want to create a common startup environment
could simply create a default .xinitrc that references a
site-wide startup file:</p>

<p>#!/bin/sh . /usr/local/lib/site.xinitrc</p>

<p>Another approach is to write a script that starts xinit
with a specific shell script. Such scripts are usually named
x11, xstart, or startx and are a convenient way to provide a
simple interface for novice users:</p>

<p>#!/bin/sh xinit /usr/local/lib/site.xinitrc --
/usr/bin/X -br</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES DISPLAY This variable gets set to
the name of the display to which clients should connect.</p>

<p>XINITRC This variable specifies an init file containing
shell commands to start up the initial windows. By default,
.xinitrc in the home directory will be used.</p>

<p>FILES .xinitrc default client script</p>

<p>xterm client to run if .xinitrc does not exist</p>

<p>.xserverrc default server script</p>

<p>X server to run if .xserverrc does not exist</p>
