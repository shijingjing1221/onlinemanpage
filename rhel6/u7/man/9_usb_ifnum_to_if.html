<p>NAME usb_ifnum_to_if - get the interface object with a
given interface number</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS struct usb_interface * usb_ifnum_to_if(const
struct usb_device * dev, unsigned ifnum);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS dev the device whose current configuration is
considered</p>

<p>ifnum the desired interface</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This walks the device descriptor for the
currently active configuration and returns a pointer to the
interface with that particular interface number, or
null.</p>

<p>Note that configuration descriptors are not required to
assign interface numbers sequentially, so that it would be
incorrect to assume that the first interface in that
descriptor corresponds to interface zero. This routine helps
device drivers avoid such mistakes. However, you should make
sure that you do the right thing with any alternate settings
available for this interfaces.</p>

<p>Don&acute;t call this function unless you are bound to
one of the interfaces on this device or you have locked the
device!</p>
