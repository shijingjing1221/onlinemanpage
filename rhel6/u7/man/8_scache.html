<p>SCACHE(8) SCACHE(8)</p>

<p>NAME scache - Postfix shared connection cache server</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS scache [generic Postfix daemon options]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The scache(8) server maintains a shared
multi-connection cache. This information can be used by, for
example, Postfix SMTP clients or other Postfix delivery
agents.</p>

<p>The connection cache is organized into logical
destination names, phys- ical endpoint names, and
connections.</p>

<p>As a specific example, logical SMTP destinations specify
(transport, domain, port), and physical SMTP endpoints
specify (transport, IP address, port). An SMTP connection
may be saved after a successful mail transaction.</p>

<p>In the general case, one logical destination may refer
to zero or more physical endpoints, one physical endpoint
may be referenced by zero or more logical destinations, and
one endpoint may refer to zero or more connections.</p>

<p>The exact syntax of a logical destination or endpoint
name is applica- tion dependent; the scache(8) server does
not care. A connection is stored as a file descriptor
together with application-dependent infor- mation that is
needed to re-activate a connection object. Again, the
scache(8) server is completely unaware of the details of
that informa- tion.</p>

<p>All information is stored with a finite time to live
(ttl). The con- nection cache daemon terminates when no
client is connected for max_idle time units.</p>

<p>This server implements the following requests:</p>

<p>save_endp ttl endpoint endpoint_properties
file_descriptor Save the specified file descriptor and
connection property data under the specified endpoint name.
The endpoint properties are used by the client to
re-activate a passivated connection object.</p>

<p>find_endp endpoint Look up cached properties and a
cached file descriptor for the specified endpoint.</p>

<p>save_dest ttl destination destination_properties
endpoint Save the binding between a logical destination and
an endpoint under the destination name, together with
destination specific connection properties. The destination
properties are used by the client to re-activate a
passivated connection object.</p>

<p>find_dest destination Look up cached destination
properties, cached endpoint proper- ties, and a cached file
descriptor for the specified logical destination.</p>

<p>SECURITY The scache(8) server is not security-sensitive.
It does not talk to the network, and it does not talk to
local users. The scache(8) server can run chrooted at fixed
low privilege.</p>

<p>The scache(8) server is not a trusted process. It must
not be used to store information that is security
sensitive.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS Problems and transactions are logged to
syslogd(8).</p>

<p>BUGS The session cache cannot be shared among multiple
machines.</p>

<p>When a connection expires from the cache, it is closed
without the appropriate protocol specific handshake.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS Changes to main.cf are picked
up automatically as scache(8) processes run for only a
limited amount of time. Use the command &quot;postfix
reload&quot; to speed up a change.</p>

<p>The text below provides only a parameter summary. See
postconf(5) for more details including examples.</p>

<p>RESOURCE CONTROLS connection_cache_ttl_limit (2s) The
maximal time-to-live value that the scache(8) connection
cache server allows.</p>

<p>connection_cache_status_update_time (600s) How
frequently the scache(8) server logs usage statistics with
connection cache hit and miss rates for logical destinations
and for physical endpoints.</p>

<p>MISCELLANEOUS CONTROLS config_directory (seepostconf
-doutput) The default location of the Postfix main.cf and
master.cf con- figuration files.</p>

<p>daemon_timeout (18000s) How much time a Postfix daemon
process may take to handle a request before it is terminated
by a built-in watchdog timer.</p>

<p>ipc_timeout (3600s) The time limit for sending or
receiving information over an internal communication
channel.</p>

<p>max_idle (100s) The maximum amount of time that an idle
Postfix daemon process waits for an incoming connection
before terminating voluntarily.</p>

<p>process_id (read-only) The process ID of a Postfix
command or daemon process.</p>

<p>process_name (read-only) The process name of a Postfix
command or daemon process.</p>

<p>syslog_facility (mail) The syslog facility of Postfix
logging.</p>

<p>syslog_name (seepostconf -doutput) The mail system name
that is prepended to the process name in syslog records, so
that &quot;smtpd&quot; becomes, for example, &quot;post-
fix/smtpd&quot;.</p>
