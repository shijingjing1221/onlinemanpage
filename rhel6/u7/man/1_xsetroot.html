<p>XSETROOT(1) XSETROOT(1)</p>

<p>NAME xsetroot - root window parameter setting utility
for X</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS xsetroot [-help] [-version] [-def] [-display
display] [-cursor cursor- file maskfile] [-cursor_name
cursorname] [-xcf cursorfile cursorsize] [-bitmap filename]
[-mod x y] [-gray] [-grey] [-fg color] [-bg color] [-rv]
[-solid color] [-name string]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The xsetroot program allows you to tailor
the appearance of the back- ground (&quot;root&quot;) window
on a workstation display running X. Normally, you experiment
with xsetroot until you find a personalized look that you
like, then put the xsetroot command that produces it into
your X startup file. If no options are specified, or if -def
is specified, the window is reset to its default state. The
-def option can be spec- ified along with other options and
only the non-specified characteris- tics will be reset to
the default state.</p>

<p>Only one of the background color/tiling changing options
(-solid, -gray, -grey, -bitmap, and -mod) may be specified
at a time.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The various options are as follows:</p>

<p>-help Print a usage message and exit.</p>

<p>-verson Print a version message and exit.</p>

<p>-def Reset unspecified attributes to the default values.
(Restores the background to the familiar gray mesh and the
cursor to the hollow x shape.)</p>

<p>-cursor cursorfile maskfile This lets you change the
pointer cursor to whatever you want when the pointer cursor
is outside of any window. Cursor and mask files are bitmaps
(little pictures), and can be made with the bitmap(1)
program. You probably want the mask file to be all black
until you get used to the way masks work.</p>

<p>-cursor_name cursorname This lets you change the pointer
cursor to one of the standard cursors from the cursor font.
Refer to appendix B of the X pro- tocol for the names
(except that the XC_ prefix is elided for this option).</p>

<p>-xcf cursorfile cursorsize This lets you change the
pointer cursor to one loaded from an Xcursor file as defined
by libXcursor, at the specified size.</p>

<p>-bitmap filename Use the bitmap specified in the file to
set the window pattern. You can make your own bitmap files
(little pictures) using the bitmap(1) program. The entire
background will be made up of repeated &quot;tiles&quot; of
the bitmap.</p>

<p>-mod x y This is used if you want a plaid-like grid
pattern on your screen. x and y are integers ranging from 1
to 16. Try the different combinations. Zero and negative
numbers are taken as 1.</p>

<p>-gray Make the entire background gray. (Easier on the
eyes.)</p>

<p>-grey Make the entire background grey.</p>

<p>-fg color Use color as the foreground color. Foreground
and back- ground colors are meaningful only in combination
with -cursor, -bitmap, or -mod.</p>

<p>-bg color Use color as the background color.</p>

<p>-rv This exchanges the foreground and background colors.
Normally the foreground color is black and the background
color is white.</p>

<p>-solid color This sets the background of the root window
to the specified color. This option is only useful on color
servers.</p>

<p>-name string Set the name of the root window to string.
There is no default value. Usually a name is assigned to a
window so that the window manager can use a text
representation when the window is iconified. This option is
unused since you cant iconify the background.</p>

<p>-display display Specifies the server to connect to; see
X(7).</p>
