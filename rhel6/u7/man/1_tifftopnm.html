<p>NAME tifftopnm - convert a TIFF file into a PNM
image</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS tifftopnm</p>

<p>[-alphaout={alpha-filename,-}] [-headerdump] [-verbose]
[-respectfil- lorder] [-byrow] [-orientraw]
[tiff-filename]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>tifftopnm reads a TIFF file as input and produces a PNM
image as out- put. The type of the output file depends on
the input file - if its black &amp; white, generates a PBM
image; if its grayscale, generates a PGM image; otherwise, a
PPM image. The program tells you which type it is
writing.</p>

<p>If the TIFF file contains multiple images (multiple
directories,), tifftopnm generates a multi-image PNM output
stream. Before Netpbm 10.27 (March 2005), however, it would
just ignore all but the first input image.</p>

<p>The tiff-filename argument names the regular file that
contains the Tiff image. If you specify - or dont specify
this argument, tfftopnm uses Standard Input. In either case,
the file must be seek- able. That means no pipe, but any
regular file is fine.</p>

<p>TIFF Capability pamtotiff uses the Libtiff.org TIFF
library (or whatever equivalent you provide) to interpret
the TIFF input. So the set of files it is able to interpret
is determined mostly by that library.</p>

<p>This program cannot read every possible TIFF file --
there are myriad variations of the TIFF format. However, it
does understand monochrome and gray scale, RGB, RGBA
(red/green/blue with alpha channel), CMYK
(Cyan-Magenta-Yellow-Black ink color separation), and color
palette TIFF files. An RGB file can have either single plane
(interleaved) color or multiple plane format. The program
reads 1-8 and 16 bit-per- sample input, the latter in either
bigendian or littlendian encoding. Tiff directory
information may also be either bigendian or littlendian.</p>

<p>There are many TIFF formats that tifftopnm can read only
if the image is small enough to fit in memory. tifftopnm
uses the TIFF librarys TIFFRGBAImageGet() function to
process the TIFF image if it can get enough memory for
TIFFRGBAImageGet() to store the whole image in memory at
once (that s what TIFFRGBAImageGet() does). If not,
tifftopnm uses a more primitive row-by-row conversion
strategy using the raw data returned by TIFFReadScanLine()
and native intelligence. That native intelligence does not
know as many formats as TIFFRGBAImageGet() does. And certain
compressed formats simply cannot be read with TIFFReadScan-
Line().</p>

<p>Before Netpbm 10.11 (October 2002), tifftopnm never used
TIFFRGBAIm- ageGet(), so it could not interpret many of the
formats it can inter- pret today.</p>

<p>There is no fundamental reason that this program could
not read other kinds of TIFF files even when they dont fit
in memory all at once. The existing limitations are mainly
because no one has asked for more.</p>

<p>Output Image The PNM output has the same maxval as the
Tiff input, except that if the Tiff input is colormapped
(which implies a maxval of 65535) the PNM output has a
maxval of 255. Though this may result in lost informa- tion,
such input images hardly ever actually have more color
resolution than a maxval of 255 provides and people often
cannot deal with PNM files that have maxval &gt; 255. By
contrast, a non-colormapped Tiff image that doesnt need a
maxval &gt; 255 doesnt have a maxval &gt; 255, so when
tifftopnm sees a non-colormapped maxval &gt; 255, it takes
it seri- ously and produces a matching output maxval.</p>

<p>Another exception is where the TIFF maxval is greater
than 65535, which is the maximum allowed by the Netpbm
formats. In that case, tifftopnm uses a maxval of 65535, and
you lose some information in the conver- sion.</p>

<p>OPTIONS You may abbreviate any option to its shortest
unique prefix. You may use two hyphens instead of one in
options. You may separate an option and its value either by
an equals sign or white space.</p>

<p>-alphaout=alpha-filename tifftopnm creates a PGM file
containing the alpha channel values in the input image. If
the input image doesnt contain an alpha channel, the
alpha-filename file contains all zero (transparent) alpha
values. If you dont specify -alphaout,</p>

<p>tifftopnm does not generate an alpha file, and if the
input image has an alpha channel, tifftopnm simply discards
it.</p>

<p>If you specify - as the filename, tifftopnm writes the
alpha output to Standard Output and discards the image.</p>

<p>See pamcomp(1)foronewaytouse the alpha output file.</p>

<p>-respectfillorder By default, tifftopnm ignores the
fillorder tag in the TIFF input, which means it may
incorrectly interpret the image. To make it follow the spec,
use this option. For a lengthy but engaging discussion of
why tifftopnm works this way and how to use the
-respectfillorder option, see the note on fillorder
below.</p>

<p>-byrow This option can make tifftopnm run faster.</p>

<p>tifftopnm has two different ways to do the conversion
from Tiff to PNM, using two different facilities of the TIFF
library:</p>

<p>Whole Image Decode the entire image into memory at once,
using TIFFRGBAIm- ageGet(), then convert to PNM and output
row by row.</p>

<p>Row By Row Read, convert, and output one row at a time
using TIFFReadScan- line().</p>

<p>Whole Image is preferable because the Tiff library does
more of the work, which means it understands more of the
Tiff format possibilities now and in the future. Also, some
compressed TIFF formats dont allow you to extract an
individual row.</p>

<p>Row By Row uses far less memory, which means with large
images, it can run in environments where Whole Image cannot
and may also run faster. And because Netpbm code does more
of the work, its possible that it can be more flexible or at
least give better diagnostic information if theres something
wrong with the TIFF.</p>

<p>The Netpbm native code may do something correctly that
the TIFF library does incorrectly, or vice versa.</p>

<p>In Netpbm, we stress function over performance, so by
default we try Whole Image first, and if we can t get enough
memory for the decoded image or TIFFRGBAImageGet() fails, we
fall back to Row By Row. But if you specify the -byrow
option, tifftopnm will not attempt Whole Image. If Row By
Row does not work, it simply fails.</p>

<p>See Color Separation (CMYK) TIFFs for a description of
one way Row By Row makes a significant difference in your
results.</p>

<p>Whole Image costs you precision when your TIFF image
uses more than 8 bits per sample. TIFFRGBAImageGet()
converts the samples to 8 bits. tifftopnm then scales them
back to maxval 65535, but the lower 8 bits of information is
gone.</p>

<p>In many versions of the TIFF library, TIFFRGBAImageGet()
does not correctly interpret TIFF files in which the raster
orienta- tion is column-major (i.e. a row of the raster is a
column of the image). With such a TIFF library and file, you
must use -byrow to get correct output.</p>

<p>Before Netpbm 10.11 (October 2002), tifftopnm always did
Row By Row. Netpbm 10.12 always tried Whole Image first.
-byrow came in with Netpbm 10.13 (January 2003).</p>

<p>-orientraw A TIFF stream contains raster data which can
be arranged in the stream various ways. Most commonly, it is
arranged by rows, with the top row first, and the pixels
left to right within each row, but many other orientations
are possible.</p>

<p>The common orientation is the same on the Netpbm formats
use, so tifftopnm can do its jobs quite efficiently when the
TIFF raster is oriented that way.</p>

<p>But if the TIFF raster is oriented any other way, it can
take a considerable amount of processing for tifftopnm to
convert it to Netpbm format.</p>

<p>-orientraw says to produce an output image that
represents the raw raster in the TIFF stream rather than the
image the TIFF stream is supposed to represent. In the
output, the top left corner corresponds to the start of the
TIFF raster, the next pixel to the right is the next pixel
in the TIFF raster, etc. tifftopnm can do this easily, but
you dont get the right image out. You can use pamflip to
turn the output into the image the TIFF stream represents
(but if you do that, you pretty much lose the benefit of
-orientraw).</p>

<p>With this option, tifftopnm always uses the Row By Row
method (see -byrow).</p>

<p>This option was new in Netpbm 10.42 (March 2008). Before
that, tifftopnm generally produces arbitrary results with
TIFF images that have an orientation other than the common
one.</p>

<p>-verbose Print extra messages to Standard Error about
the conversion.</p>

<p>-headerdump Dump TIFF file information to stderr. This
information may be useful in debugging TIFF file conversion
problems.</p>

<p>NOTES Fillorder There is a piece of information in the
header of a TIFF image called fillorder. The TIFF
specification quite clearly states that this value tells the
order in which bits are arranged in a byte in the
description of the image s pixels. There are two options,
assuming that the image has a format where more than one
pixel can be repre- sented by a single byte: 1) the byte is
filled from most significant bit to least significant bit
going left to right in the image; and 2) the opposite.</p>

<p>However, there is confusion in the world as to the
meaning of fil- lorder. Evidence shows that some people
believe it has to do with byte order when a single value is
represented by two bytes.</p>

<p>These people cause TIFF images to be created that, while
they use a MSB-to-LSB fillorder, have a fillorder tag that
says they used LSB-to- MSB. A program that properly
interprets a TIFF image will not end up with the image that
the author intended in this case.</p>

<p>For a long time, tifftopnm did not understand fillorder
itself and assumed the fillorder was MSB-to-LSB regardless
of the fillorder tag in the TIFF header. And as far as I
know, there is no legitimate reason to use a fillorder other
than MSB-to-LSB. So users of tifftopnm were happily using
those TIFF images that had incorrect fillorder tags.</p>

<p>So that those users can continue to be happy, tifftopnm
today continues to ignore the fillorder tag unless you tell
it not to. (It does, how- ever, warn you when the fillorder
tag does not say MSB-to-LSB that the tag is being
ignored).</p>

<p>If for some reason you have a TIFF image that actually
has LSB-to-MSB fillorder, and its fillorder tag correctly
indicates that, you must use the -respectfillorder option on
tifftopnm to get proper results.</p>

<p>Examples of incorrect TIFF images are at
ftp://weather.noaa.gov. They are apparently created by a
program called faxtotiff.</p>

<p>Color Separation (CMYK) TIFFs Some TIFF images contain
color information in CMYK form, whereas PNM images use RGB.
There are various formulas for converting between these two
forms, and tifftopnm can use either of two.</p>

<p>The TIFF library (Version 3.5.4 from libtiff.org) uses
Y=(1-K)*(1-B) (similar for R and G) in its
TIFFRGBAImageGet() service. When tifftopnm works in Whole
Image mode, it uses that service, so thats the conversion
you get.</p>

<p>But when tifftopnm runs in Row By Row mode, it does not
use TIFFRGBAIm- ageGet(), and you get what appears to be
more useful: Y=1-(B+K). This is the inverse of what
pnmtotiffcmyk does.</p>

<p>See the -byrow option for more information on Whole
Image versus Row By Row mode.</p>

<p>Before Netpbm 10.21 (March 2004), tifftopnm used the
Y=(1-K)*(1-B) for- mula always.</p>
