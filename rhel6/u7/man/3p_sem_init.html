<p>SEM_INIT(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual SEM_INIT(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME sem_init - initialize an unnamed semaphore
(REALTIME)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;semaphore.h&gt;</p>

<p>int sem_init(sem_t *sem, int pshared, unsigned
value);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sem_init() function shall initialize the
unnamed semaphore referred to by sem. The value of the
initialized semaphore shall be value. Fol- lowing a
successful call to sem_init(), the semaphore may be used in
subsequent calls to sem_wait(), sem_trywait(), sem_post(),
and sem_destroy(). This semaphore shall remain usable until
the semaphore is destroyed.</p>

<p>If the pshared argument has a non-zero value, then the
semaphore is shared between processes; in this case, any
process that can access the semaphore sem can use sem for
performing sem_wait(), sem_trywait(), sem_post(), and
sem_destroy() operations.</p>

<p>Only sem itself may be used for performing
synchronization. The result of referring to copies of sem in
calls to sem_wait(), sem_trywait(), sem_post(), and
sem_destroy() is undefined.</p>

<p>If the pshared argument is zero, then the semaphore is
shared between threads of the process; any thread in this
process can use sem for per- forming sem_wait(),
sem_trywait(), sem_post(), and sem_destroy() opera- tions.
The use of the semaphore by threads other than those created
in the same process is undefined.</p>

<p>Attempting to initialize an already initialized
semaphore results in undefined behavior.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, the sem_init()
function shall initialize the semaphore in sem. Otherwise,
it shall return -1 and set errno to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The sem_init() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The value argument exceeds {SEM_VALUE_MAX}.</p>

<p>ENOSPC A resource required to initialize the semaphore
has been exhausted, or the limit on semaphores (
{SEM_NSEMS_MAX}) has been reached.</p>

<p>EPERM The process lacks the appropriate privileges to
initialize the semaphore.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The sem_init() function is part of the
Semaphores option and need not be available on all
implementations.</p>

<p>RATIONALE Although this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001
fails to specify a suc- cessful return value, it is likely
that a later version may require the implementation to
return a value of zero if the call to sem_init() is
successful.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
