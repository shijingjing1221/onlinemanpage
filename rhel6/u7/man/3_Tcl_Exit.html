<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME Tcl_Exit, Tcl_Finalize, Tcl_CreateExitHandler,
Tcl_DeleteExitHandler, Tcl_ExitThread, Tcl_FinalizeThread,
Tcl_CreateThreadExitHandler, Tcl_DeleteThreadExitHandler,
Tcl_SetExitProc - end the application or thread (and invoke
exit handlers)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tcl.h&gt;</p>

<p>Tcl_Exit(status)</p>

<p>Tcl_Finalize()</p>

<p>Tcl_CreateExitHandler(proc, clientData)</p>

<p>Tcl_DeleteExitHandler(proc, clientData)</p>

<p>Tcl_ExitThread(status)</p>

<p>Tcl_FinalizeThread()</p>

<p>Tcl_CreateThreadExitHandler(proc, clientData)</p>

<p>Tcl_DeleteThreadExitHandler(proc, clientData)</p>

<p>Tcl_ExitProc * Tcl_SetExitProc(proc)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS int status (in) Provides information about why
the application or thread exited. Exact meaning may be
platform- specific. 0 usually means a nor- mal exit, any
nonzero value usu- ally means that an error occurred.</p>

<p>Tcl_ExitProc *proc (in) Procedure to invoke before exit-
ing application, or (for Tcl_SetExitProc) NULL to unin-
stall the current application exit procedure.</p>

<p>ClientData clientData (in) Arbitrary one-word value to
pass to proc.
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The procedures described here provide a
graceful mechanism to end the execution of a Tcl
application. Exit handlers are invoked to cleanup the
applications state before ending the execution of Tcl
code.</p>

<p>Invoke Tcl_Exit to end a Tcl application and to exit
from this process. This procedure is invoked by the exit
command, and can be invoked any- place else to terminate the
application. No-one should ever invoke the exit system
procedure directly; always invoke Tcl_Exit instead, so that
it can invoke exit handlers. Note that if other code invokes
exit system procedure directly, or otherwise causes the
application to ter- minate without calling Tcl_Exit, the
exit handlers will not be run. Tcl_Exit internally invokes
the exit system call, thus it never returns control to its
caller. If an application exit handler has been installed
(see Tcl_SetExitProc), that handler is invoked with an argu-
ment consisting of the exit status (cast to ClientData); the
applica- tion exit handler should not return control to
Tcl.</p>

<p>Tcl_Finalize is similar to Tcl_Exit except that it does
not exit from the current process. It is useful for cleaning
up when a process is finished using Tcl but wishes to
continue executing, and when Tcl is used in a dynamically
loaded extension that is about to be unloaded. On some
systems Tcl is automatically notified when it is being
unloaded, and it calls Tcl_Finalize internally; on these
systems it not necessary for the caller to explicitly call
Tcl_Finalize. However, to ensure portability, your code
should always invoke Tcl_Finalize when Tcl is being
unloaded, to ensure that the code will work on all plat-
forms. Tcl_Finalize can be safely called more than once.</p>

<p>Tcl_ExitThread is used to terminate the current thread
and invoke per- thread exit handlers. This finalization is
done by Tcl_FinalizeThread, which you can call if you just
want to clean up per-thread state and invoke the thread exit
handlers. Tcl_Finalize calls Tcl_FinalizeThread for the
current thread automatically.</p>

<p>Tcl_CreateExitHandler arranges for proc to be invoked by
Tcl_Finalize and Tcl_Exit. Tcl_CreateThreadExitHandler
arranges for proc to be invoked by Tcl_FinalizeThread and
Tcl_ExitThread. This provides a hook for cleanup operations
such as flushing buffers and freeing global mem- ory. Proc
should match the type Tcl_ExitProc: typedef void
Tcl_ExitProc(ClientData clientData); The clientData
parameter to proc is a copy of the clientData argument given
to Tcl_CreateExitHandler or Tcl_CreateThreadExitHandler when
the callback was created. Typically, clientData points to a
data structure containing application-specific information
about what to do in proc.</p>

<p>Tcl_DeleteExitHandler and Tcl_DeleteThreadExitHandler
may be called to delete a previously-created exit handler.
It removes the handler indi- cated by proc and clientData so
that no call to proc will be made. If no such handler exists
then Tcl_DeleteExitHandler or Tcl_DeleteThread- ExitHandler
does nothing.</p>

<p>Tcl_Finalize and Tcl_Exit execute all registered exit
handlers, in reverse order from the order in which they were
registered. This matches the natural order in which
extensions are loaded and unloaded; if extension A loads
extension B, it usually unloads B before it itself is
unloaded. If extension A registers its exit handlers before
loading extension B, this ensures that any exit handlers for
B will be executed before the exit handlers for A.</p>

<p>Tcl_Finalize and Tcl_Exit call Tcl_FinalizeThread and
the thread exit handlers after the process-wide exit
handlers. This is because thread finalization shuts down the
I/O channel system, so any attempt at I/O by the global exit
handlers will vanish into the bitbucket.</p>

<p>Tcl_SetExitProc installs an application exit handler,
returning the previously-installed application exit handler
or NULL if no application handler was installed. If an
application exit handler is installed, that exit handler
takes over complete responsibility for finalization of Tcls
subsystems via Tcl_Finalize at an appropriate time. The
argu- ment passed to proc when it is invoked will be the
exit status code (as passed to Tcl_Exit) cast to a
ClientData value.</p>
