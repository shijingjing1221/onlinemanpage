<p>FIND(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual FIND(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME find - find files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS find [-H | -L] path ... [operand_expression
...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The find utility shall recursively descend
the directory hierarchy from each file specified by path,
evaluating a Boolean expression composed of the primaries
described in the OPERANDS section for each file
encountered.</p>

<p>The find utility shall be able to descend to arbitrary
depths in a file hierarchy and shall not fail due to path
length limitations (unless a path operand specified by the
application exceeds {PATH_MAX} require- ments).</p>

<p>The find utility shall detect infinite loops; that is,
entering a pre- viously visited directory that is an
ancestor of the last file encoun- tered. When it detects an
infinite loop, find shall write a diagnostic message to
standard error and shall either recover its position in the
hierarchy or terminate.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The find utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>The following options shall be supported by the
implementation:</p>

<p>-H Cause the file information and file type evaluated
for each sym- bolic link encountered on the command line to
be those of the file referenced by the link, and not the
link itself. If the referenced file does not exist, the file
information and type shall be for the link itself. File
information for all symbolic links not on the command line
shall be that of the link itself.</p>

<p>-L Cause the file information and file type evaluated
for each sym- bolic link to be those of the file referenced
by the link, and not the link itself.</p>

<p>Specifying more than one of the mutually-exclusive
options -H and -L shall not be considered an error. The last
option specified shall determine the behavior of the
utility.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operands shall be supported:</p>

<p>The path operand is a pathname of a starting point in
the directory hierarchy.</p>

<p>The first argument that starts with a, or is a! or a ,
and all subsequent arguments shall be interpreted as an
expression made up of the following primaries and operators.
In the descriptions, wherever n is used as a primary
argument, it shall be interpreted as a decimal integer
optionally preceded by a plus (+) or minus (-) sign, as
follows:</p>

<p>+n More than n.</p>

<p>n Exactly n.</p>

<p>-n Less than n.</p>

<p>The following primaries shall be supported:</p>

<p>-name pattern</p>

<p>The primary shall evaluate as true if the basename of
the file- name being examined matches pattern using the
pattern matching notation described in Pattern Matching
Notation .</p>

<p>-nouser The primary shall evaluate as true if the file
belongs to a user ID for which the getpwuid() function
defined in the System Interfaces volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001 (or equivalent) returns NULL.</p>

<p>-nogroup The primary shall evaluate as true if the file
belongs to a group ID for which the getgrgid() function
defined in the System Interfaces volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001 (or equivalent) returns NULL.</p>

<p>-xdev The primary shall always evaluate as true; it
shall cause find not to continue descending past directories
that have a differ- ent device ID ( st_dev, see the stat()
function defined in the System Interfaces volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001). If any -xdev primary is specified, it shall
apply to the entire expression even if the -xdev primary
would not normally be evaluated.</p>

<p>-prune The primary shall always evaluate as true; it
shall cause find not to descend the current pathname if it
is a directory. If the -depth primary is specified, the
-prune primary shall have no effect.</p>

<p>-perm [-]mode</p>

<p>The mode argument is used to represent file mode bits.
It shall be identical in format to the symbolic_mode operand
described in chmod(), and shall be interpreted as follows.
To start, a tem- plate shall be assumed with all file mode
bits cleared. An op symbol of + shall set the appropriate
mode bits in the tem- plate;-shall clear the appropriate
bits;=shall set the appropriate mode bits, without regard to
the contents of pro- cess file mode creation mask. The op
symbol of - cannot be the first character of mode; this
avoids ambiguity with the optional leading hyphen. Since the
initial mode is all bits off, there are not any symbolic
modes that need to use-as the first character.</p>

<p>If the hyphen is omitted, the primary shall evaluate as
true when the file permission bits exactly match the value
of the resulting template.</p>

<p>Otherwise, if mode is prefixed by a hyphen, the primary
shall evaluate as true if at least all the bits in the
resulting template are set in the file permission bits.</p>

<p>-perm [-]onum</p>

<p>If the hyphen is omitted, the primary shall evaluate as
true when the file permission bits exactly match the value
of the octal number onum and only the bits corresponding to
the octal mask 07777 shall be compared. (See the description
of the octal mode in chmod().) Otherwise, if onum is
prefixed by a hyphen, the primary shall evaluate as true if
at least all of the bits specified in onum that are also set
in the octal mask 07777 are set.</p>

<p>-type c The primary shall evaluate as true if the type
of the file is c, where c is,,,,,, orsfor block spe- cial
file, character special file, directory, symbolic link,
FIFO, regular file, or socket, respectively.</p>

<p>-links n The primary shall evaluate as true if the file
has n links.</p>

<p>-user uname The primary shall evaluate as true if the
file belongs to the user uname. If uname is a decimal
integer and the getpwnam() (or equivalent) function does not
return a valid user name, uname shall be interpreted as a
user ID.</p>

<p>-group gname</p>

<p>The primary shall evaluate as true if the file belongs
to the group gname. If gname is a decimal integer and the
getgrnam() (or equivalent) function does not return a valid
group name, gname shall be interpreted as a group ID.</p>

<p>-size n[c] The primary shall evaluate as true if the
file size in bytes, divided by 512 and rounded up to the
next integer, is n. If n is followed by the character, the
size shall be in bytes.</p>

<p>-atime n The primary shall evaluate as true if the file
access time sub- tracted from the initialization time,
divided by 86400 (with any remainder discarded), is n.</p>

<p>-ctime n The primary shall evaluate as true if the time
of last change of file status information subtracted from
the initialization time, divided by 86400 (with any
remainder discarded), is n.</p>

<p>-mtime n The primary shall evaluate as true if the file
modification time subtracted from the initialization time,
divided by 86400 (with any remainder discarded), is n.</p>

<p>-exec utility_name [argument ...] ;</p>

<p>-exec utility_name [argument ...] {} +</p>

<p>The end of the primary expression shall be punctuated by
a semi- colon or by a plus sign. Only a plus sign that
follows an argu- ment containing the two characters
&quot;{}&quot; shall punctuate the end of the primary
expression. Other uses of the plus sign shall not be treated
as special.</p>

<p>If the primary expression is punctuated by a semicolon,
the utility utility_name shall be invoked once for each
pathname and the primary shall evaluate as true if the
utility returns a zero value as exit sta- tus. A
utility_name or argument containing only the two characters
&quot;{}&quot; shall be replaced by the current
pathname.</p>

<p>If the primary expression is punctuated by a plus sign,
the primary shall always evaluate as true, and the pathnames
for which the primary is evaluated shall be aggregated into
sets. The utility utility_name shall be invoked once for
each set of aggregated pathnames. Each invo- cation shall
begin after the last pathname in the set is aggregated, and
shall be completed before the find utility exits and before
the first pathname in the next set (if any) is aggregated
for this primary, but it is otherwise unspecified whether
the invocation occurs before, during, or after the
evaluations of other primaries. If any invocation returns a
non-zero value as exit status, the find utility shall return
a non-zero exit status. An argument containing only the two
characters &quot;{}&quot; shall be replaced by the set of
aggregated pathnames, with each pathname passed as a
separate argument to the invoked utility in the same order
that it was aggregated. The size of any set of two or more
pathnames shall be limited such that execution of the
utility does not cause the systems {ARG_MAX} limit to be
exceeded. If more than one argument containing only the two
characters &quot;{}&quot; is present, the behav- ior is
unspecified.</p>

<p>If a utility_name or argument string contains the two
characters &quot;{}&quot;, but not just the two characters
&quot;{}&quot;, it is implementation-defined whether find
replaces those two characters or uses the string without
change. The current directory for the invocation of
utility_name shall be the same as the current directory when
the find utility was started. If the utility_name names any
of the special built-in utilities (see Special Built-In
Utilities ), the results are undefined.</p>

<p>-ok utility_name [argument ...] ;</p>

<p>The -ok primary shall be equivalent to -exec, except
that the use of a plus sign to punctuate the end of the
primary expres- sion need not be supported, and find shall
request affirmation of the invocation of utility_name using
the current file as an argument by writing to standard error
as described in the STDERR section. If the response on
standard input is affirmative, the utility shall be invoked.
Otherwise, the command shall not be invoked and the value of
the -ok operand shall be false.</p>

<p>-print The primary shall always evaluate as true; it
shall cause the current pathname to be written to standard
output.</p>

<p>-newer file The primary shall evaluate as true if the
modification time of the current file is more recent than
the modification time of the file named by the pathname
file.</p>

<p>-depth The primary shall always evaluate as true; it
shall cause descent of the directory hierarchy to be done so
that all entries in a directory are acted on before the
directory itself. If a -depth primary is not specified, all
entries in a directory shall be acted on after the directory
itself. If any -depth pri- mary is specified, it shall apply
to the entire expression even if the -depth primary would
not normally be evaluated.</p>

<p>The primaries can be combined using the following
operators (in order of decreasing precedence):</p>

<p>( expression ) True if expression is true.</p>

<p>! expression Negation of a primary; the unary NOT
operator.</p>

<p>expression [-a] expression</p>

<p>Conjunction of primaries; the AND operator is implied by
the juxtaposition of two primaries or made explicit by the
optional -a operator. The second expression shall not be
evaluated if the first expression is false.</p>

<p>expression -o expression</p>

<p>Alternation of primaries; the OR operator. The second
expression shall not be evaluated if the first expression is
true.</p>

<p>If no expression is present, -print shall be used as the
expression. Otherwise, if the given expression does not
contain any of the pri- maries -exec, -ok, or -print, the
given expression shall be effectively replaced by:</p>

<p>( given_expression ) -print</p>

<p>The -user, -group, and -newer primaries each shall
evaluate their respective arguments only once.</p>

<p>STDIN If the -ok primary is used, the response shall be
read from the stan- dard input. An entire line shall be read
as the response. Otherwise, the standard input shall not be
used.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of find:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_COLLATE</p>

<p>Determine the locale for the behavior of ranges,
equivalence classes, and multi-character collating elements
used in the pat- tern matching notation for the -n option
and in the extended regular expression defined for the
yesexpr locale keyword in the LC_MESSAGES category.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE This variable determines the locale for the
interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as
characters (for example, sin- gle-byte as opposed to
multi-byte characters in arguments), the behavior of
character classes within the pattern matching nota- tion
used for the -n option, and the behavior of character
classes within regular expressions used in the extended
regular expression defined for the yesexpr locale keyword in
the LC_MES- SAGES category.</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale for the processing of
affirmative responses that should be used to affect the
format and contents of diag- nostic messages written to
standard error.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>PATH Determine the location of the utility_name for the
-exec and -ok primaries, as described in the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Chapter 8,
Environment Variables.</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT The -print primary shall cause the current
pathnames to be written to standard output. The format shall
be:</p>

<p>&quot;%n&quot;, &lt;path&gt;</p>

<p>STDERR The -ok primary shall write a prompt to standard
error containing at least the utility_name to be invoked and
the current pathname. In the POSIX locale, the last non-
&lt;blank&gt; in the prompt shall be?. The exact format used
is unspecified.</p>

<p>Otherwise, the standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic mes- sages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 All path operands were traversed successfully.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE When used in operands, pattern
matching notation, semicolons, opening parentheses, and
closing parentheses are special to the shell and must be
quoted (see Quoting ).</p>

<p>The bit that is traditionally used for sticky
(historically 01000) is specified in the -perm primary using
the octal number argument form. Since this bit is not
defined by this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, applications
must not assume that it actually refers to the traditional
sticky bit.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES 1. The following commands are equivalent:</p>

<p>find . find . -print</p>

<p>They both write out the entire directory hierarchy from
the current directory.</p>

<p>2. The following command:</p>

<p>find /( -name tmp -o -name*.x) -atime +7 -exec rm
{};</p>

<p>removes all files named tmp or ending in .xx that have
not been accessed for seven or more 24-hour periods.</p>

<p>3. The following command:</p>

<p>find . -perm -o+w,+s</p>

<p>prints ( -print is assumed) the names of all files in or
below the cur- rent directory, with all of the file
permission bits S_ISUID, S_ISGID, and S_IWOTH set.</p>

<p>4. The following command:</p>

<p>find . -name SCCS -prune -o -print</p>

<p>recursively prints pathnames of all files in the current
directory and below, but skips directories named SCCS and
files in them.</p>

<p>5. The following command:</p>

<p>find . -print -name SCCS -prune</p>

<p>behaves as in the previous example, but prints the names
of the SCCS directories.</p>

<p>6. The following command is roughly equivalent to the
-nt extension to test:</p>

<p>if [ -n &quot;$(find file1 -prune -newer file2)&quot; ];
then printf %n &quot;file1 is newer than file2&quot; fi</p>

<p>7. The descriptions of -atime, -ctime, and -mtime use
the terminology n &quot;86400 second periods (days)&quot;.
For example, a file accessed at 23:59 is selected by:</p>

<p>find . -atime -1 -print</p>

<p>at 00:01 the next day (less than 24 hours later, not
more than one day ago); the midnight boundary between days
has no effect on the 24-hour calculation.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The -a operator was retained as an optional
operator for compatibility with historical shell scripts,
even though it is redundant with expres- sion
concatenation.</p>

<p>The descriptions of the-modifier on the mode and onum
arguments to the -perm primary agree with historical
practice on BSD and System V implementations. System V and
BSD documentation both describe it in terms of checking
additional bits; in fact, it uses the same bits, but checks
for having at least all of the matching bits set instead of
hav- ing exactly the matching bits set.</p>

<p>The exact format of the interactive prompts is
unspecified. Only the general nature of the contents of
prompts are specified because:</p>

<p>* Implementations may desire more descriptive prompts
than those used on historical implementations.</p>

<p>* Since the historical prompt strings do not terminate
with &lt;new- line&gt;s, there is no portable way for
another program to interact with the prompts of this utility
via pipes.</p>

<p>Therefore, an application using this prompting option
relies on the system to provide the most suitable dialog
directly with the user, based on the general guidelines
specified.</p>

<p>The -name file operand was changed to use the shell
pattern matching notation so that find is consistent with
other utilities using pattern matching.</p>

<p>The -size operand refers to the size of a file, rather
than the number of blocks it may occupy in the file system.
The intent is that the st_size field defined in the System
Interfaces volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 should be used,
not the st_blocks found in histor- ical implementations.
There are at least two reasons for this:</p>

<p>1. In both System V and BSD, find only uses st_size in
size calcula- tions for the operands specified by this
volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001. (BSD uses st_blocks only
when processing the -ls primary.)</p>

<p>2. Users usually think of file size in terms of bytes,
which is also the unit used by the ls utility for the output
from the -l option. (In both System V and BSD, ls uses
st_size for the -l option size field and uses st_blocks for
the ls -s calculations. This volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001
does not specify ls -s.)</p>

<p>The descriptions of -atime, -ctime, and -mtime were
changed from the SVID description of n &quot;days to
&quot;24-hour periods&quot;. The description is also
different in terms of the exact timeframe for the n case
(versus the +n or -n), but it matches all known historical
implementations. It refers to one 86400 second period in the
past, not any time from the beginning of that period to the
current time. For example, -atime 3 is true if the file was
accessed any time in the period from 72 hours to 48 hours
ago.</p>

<p>Historical implementations do not modify &quot;{}&quot;
when it appears as a sub- string of an -exec or -ok
utility_name or argument string. There have been numerous
user requests for this extension, so this volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001 allows the desired behavior. At least one recent
implementation does support this feature, but encountered
several prob- lems in managing memory allocation and dealing
with multiple occur- rences of &quot;{}&quot; in a string
while it was being developed, so it is not yet required
behavior.</p>

<p>Assuming the presence of -print was added to correct a
historical pit- fall that plagues novice users, it is
entirely upwards-compatible from the historical System V
find utility. In its simplest form ( find directory), it
could be confused with the historical BSD fast find. The BSD
developers agreed that adding -print as a default expression
was the correct decision and have added the fast find
functionality within a new utility called locate.</p>

<p>Historically, the -L option was implemented using the
primary -follow. The -H and -L options were added for two
reasons. First, they offer a finer granularity of control
and consistency with other programs that walk file
hierarchies. Second, the -follow primary always evaluated to
true. As they were historically really global variables that
took effect before the traversal began, some valid
expressions had unex- pected results. An example is the
expression -print -o -follow. Because -print always
evaluates to true, the standard order of evaluation implies
that -follow would never be evaluated. This was never the
case. Historical practice for the -follow primary, however,
is not consis- tent. Some implementations always follow
symbolic links on the command line whether -follow is
specified or not. Others follow symbolic links on the
command line only if -follow is specified. Both behaviors
are provided by the -H and -L options, but scripts using the
current -fol- low primary would be broken if the -follow
option is specified to work either way.</p>

<p>Since the -L option resolves all symbolic links and the
-type l primary is true for symbolic links that still exist
after symbolic links have been resolved, the command:</p>

<p>find -L . -type l</p>

<p>prints a list of symbolic links reachable from the
current directory that do not resolve to accessible
files.</p>

<p>A feature of SVR4s find utility was the -exec primary s
+ terminator. This allowed filenames containing special
characters (especially &lt;new- line&gt;s) to be grouped
together without the problems that occur if such filenames
are piped to xargs. Other implementations have added other
ways to get around this problem, notably a -print0 primary
that wrote filenames with a null byte terminator. This was
considered here, but not adopted. Using a null terminator
meant that any utility that was going to process find s
-print0 output had to add a new option to parse the null
terminators it would now be reading.</p>

<p>The &quot;-exec ... {} +&quot; syntax adopted was a
result of IEEE PASC Interpre- tation 1003.2 #210. It should
be noted that this is an incompatible change to the ISO/IEC
9899:1999 standard. For example, the following command
prints all files with a-after their name if they are regu-
lar files, and a+otherwise:</p>

<p>find / -type f -exec echo {} -;-o -exec echo {} +;</p>

<p>The change invalidates usage like this. Even though the
previous stan- dard stated that this usage would work, in
practice many did not sup- port it and the standard
developers felt it better to now state that this was not
allowable.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
