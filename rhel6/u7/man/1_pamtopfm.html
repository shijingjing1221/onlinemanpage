<p>NAME pamtopfm - Convert Netpbm image to PFM (Portable
Float Map)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pamtopfm [-endian={big|little}] [-scale=float]
[imagefile]</p>

<p>All options can be abbreviated to their shortest unique
prefix. You may use two hyphens instead of one. You may
separate an option name and its value with white space
instead of an equals sign.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pamtopfm reads a Netpbm image (PNM or PAM) and converts
it to a PFM (Portable Float Map) image.</p>

<p>The PFM (Portable Float Map) image format is a lot like
PPM, but uses floating point numbers with no maxval to
achieve a High Dynamic Range (HDR) format. That means it
doesn t have a concept of absolute color and it can
represent generic light intensity information rather than
just visual information like PPM does. For example, two
pixels that are so close in intensity that the human eye
cannot tell them apart are not visually distinct, so a
visual image format such as PPM would have no reason to use
different sample values for them. But an HDR format
would.</p>

<p>There are details of the PFM format in the PFM Format
Description (1).</p>

<p>USCs HDRShop program and a program called Lefty use
it.</p>

<p>pamtopfm creates a color PFM image if its input is RGB
(PPM) and a non- color PFM otherwise.</p>

<p>Use pfmtopam(1)toconvertaPFM image to Netpbm format.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -scale=float</p>

<p>This specifies the scale factor of the PFM image. Scale
factor is a component of the PFM format. Default is 1.0.</p>

<p>-endian={big|little}</p>

<p>This specifies the endianness of the PFM image. The
samples in the raster of a PFM image are 4 byte IEEE
floating point numbers. A parameter of the IEEE format, and
therefore the PFM format, is endianness, i.e. whether the
specified bytes are ordered from low addresses to high
addresses or vice versa.</p>

<p>big means big endian -- the natural ordering; little
means little-endian, the Intel-friendly ordering.</p>

<p>Default is whichever endianness the machine on which
pamtopfm runs uses internally, which results in the faster
execu- tion.</p>

(April 2004).</p>
