<p>FUTEX(7) Linux Programmer s Manual FUTEX(7)</p>

<p>NAME futex - Fast Userspace Locking</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;linux/futex.h&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The Linux kernel provides futexes
(&quot;Fast Userspace muTexes&quot;) as a building block for
fast userspace locking and semaphores. Futexes are very
basic and lend themselves well for building higher level
locking abstractions such as POSIX mutexes.</p>

<p>This page does not set out to document all design
decisions but restricts itself to issues relevant for
application and library devel- opment. Most programmers will
in fact not be using futexes directly but instead rely on
system libraries built on them, such as the NPTL pthreads
implementation.</p>

<p>A futex is identified by a piece of memory which can be
shared between different processes. In these different
processes, it need not have identical addresses. In its bare
form, a futex has semaphore seman- tics; it is a counter
that can be incremented and decremented atomi- cally;
processes can wait for the value to become positive.</p>

<p>Futex operation is entirely userspace for the
non-contended case. The kernel is only involved to arbitrate
the contended case. As any sane design will strive for
non-contention, futexes are also optimized for this
situation.</p>

<p>In its bare form, a futex is an aligned integer which is
only touched by atomic assembler instructions. Processes can
share this integer using mmap(2), via shared memory segments
or because they share memory space, in which case the
application is commonly called multithreaded.</p>

<p>Semantics Any futex operation starts in userspace, but
it may necessary to commu- nicate with the kernel using the
futex(2) system call.</p>

<p>To &quot;up&quot; a futex, execute the proper assembler
instructions that will cause the host CPU to atomically
increment the integer. Afterwards, check if it has in fact
changed from 0 to 1, in which case there were no waiters and
the operation is done. This is the non-contended case which
is fast and should be common.</p>

<p>In the contended case, the atomic increment changed the
counter from -1 (or some other negative number). If this is
detected, there are wait- ers. Userspace should now set the
counter to 1 and instruct the kernel to wake up any waiters
using the FUTEX_WAKE operation.</p>

<p>Waiting on a futex, to &quot;down&quot; it, is the
reverse operation. Atomically decrement the counter and
check if it changed to 0, in which case the operation is
done and the futex was uncontended. In all other circum-
stances, the process should set the counter to -1 and
request that the kernel wait for another process to up the
futex. This is done using the FUTEX_WAIT operation.</p>

<p>The futex(2) system call can optionally be passed a
timeout specifying how long the kernel should wait for the
futex to be upped. In this case, semantics are more complex
and the programmer is referred to futex(2) for more details.
The same holds for asynchronous futex wait- ing.</p>

<p>VERSIONS Initial futex support was merged in Linux 2.5.7
but with different semantics from those described above.
Current semantics are available from Linux 2.5.40
onwards.</p>

<p>NOTES To reiterate, bare futexes are not intended as an
easy to use abstrac- tion for end-users. Implementors are
expected to be assembly literate and to have read the
sources of the futex userspace library referenced below.</p>

<p>This man page illustrates the most common use of the
futex(2) primi- tives: it is by no means the only one.</p>
