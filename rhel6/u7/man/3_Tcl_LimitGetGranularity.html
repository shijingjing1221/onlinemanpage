<p>ARGUMENTS Tcl_Interp *interp (in) Interpreter that the
limit being managed applies to or that will have its limits
checked.</p>

<p>int type (in) The type of limit that the opera- tion
refers to. This must be either TCL_LIMIT_COM- MANDS or
TCL_LIMIT_TIME.</p>

<p>int commandLimit (in) The maximum num- ber of commands
(as reported by info cmdcount) that may be exe- cuted in the
interpreter.</p>

<p>Tcl_Time *timeLimitPtr (in/out) A pointer to a structure
that will either have the new time limit read from
(Tcl_LimitSet- Time) or the cur- rent time limit written to
(Tcl_LimitGet- Time).</p>

<p>int granularity (in) Divisor that indicates how often a
particu- lar limit should really be checked. Must be at
least 1.</p>

<p>Tcl_LimitHandlerProc *handlerProc (in) Function to call
when a particular limit is exceeded. If the handlerProc
removes or raises the limit during its processing, the
limited interpreter will be permitted to continue to pro-
cess after the handler returns. Many handlers may be
attached to the same inter- preter limit; their order of
execution is not defined, and they must be identi- fied by
handler- Proc and client- Data when they are deleted.</p>

<p>ClientData clientData (in) Arbitrary pointer-sized word
used to pass some context to the handlerProc function.</p>

<p>Tcl_LimitHandlerDeleteProc *deleteProc (in) Function to
call whenever a han- dler is deleted. May be NULL if the
clientData requires no dele- tion.
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Tcl s interpreter resource limit subsystem
allows for close control over how much computation time a
script may use, and is useful for cases where a program is
divided into multiple pieces where some parts are more
trusted than others (e.g. web application servers).</p>

<p>Every interpreter may have a limit on the wall-time for
execution, and a limit on the number of commands that the
interpreter may execute. Since checking of these limits is
potentially expensive (especially the time limit), each
limit also has a checking granularity, which is a divisor
for an internal count of the number of points in the core
where a check may be performed (which is immediately before
executing a com- mand and at an unspecified frequency
between running commands, which can happen in empty-bodied
while loops).</p>

<p>The final component of the limit engine is a callback
scheme which allows for notifications of when a limit has
been exceeded. These callbacks can just provide logging, or
may allocate more resources to the interpreter to permit it
to continue processing longer.</p>

<p>When a limit is exceeded (and the callbacks have run;
the order of exe- cution of the callbacks is unspecified)
execution in the limited inter- preter is stopped by raising
an error and setting a flag that prevents the catch command
in that interpreter from trapping that error. It is up to
the context that started execution in that interpreter
(typically a master interpreter) to handle the error.</p>

<p>LIMIT CHECKING API To check the resource limits for an
interpreter, call Tcl_LimitCheck, which returns TCL_OK if
the limit was not exceeded (after processing callbacks) and
TCL_ERROR if the limit was exceeded (in which case an error
message is also placed in the interpreter result). That
function should only be called when Tcl_LimitReady returns
non-zero so that granularity policy is enforced. This API is
designed to be similar in usage to Tcl_AsyncReady and
Tcl_AsyncInvoke.</p>

<p>When writing code that may behave like catch in respect
of errors, you should only trap an error if
Tcl_LimitExceeded returns zero. If it returns non-zero, the
interpreter is in a limit-exceeded state and errors should
be allowed to propagate to the calling context. You can also
check whether a particular type of limit has been exceeded
using Tcl_LimitTypeExceeded.</p>

<p>LIMIT CONFIGURATION To check whether a limit has been
set (but not whether it has actually been exceeded) on an
interpreter, call Tcl_LimitTypeEnabled with the type of
limit you want to check. To enable a particular limit call
Tcl_LimitTypeSet, and to disable a limit call
Tcl_LimitTypeReset.</p>

<p>The level of a command limit may be set using
Tcl_LimitSetCommands, and retrieved using
Tcl_LimitGetCommands. Similarly for a time limit with
Tcl_LimitSetTime and Tcl_LimitGetTime respectively, but with
that API the time limit is copied from and to the Tcl_Time
structure that the timeLimitPtr argument points to.</p>

<p>The checking granularity for a particular limit may be
set using Tcl_LimitSetGranularity and retrieved using
Tcl_LimitGetGranularity. Note that granularities must always
be positive.</p>

<p>LIMIT CALLBACKS To add a handler callback to be invoked
when a limit is exceeded, call Tcl_LimitAddHandler. The
handlerProc argument describes the function that will
actually be called; it should have the following
prototype:</p>

<p>typedef void Tcl_LimitHandlerProc( ClientData
clientData, Tcl_Interp *interp);</p>

<p>The clientData argument to the handler will be whatever
is passed to the clientData argment to Tcl_LimitAddHandler,
and the interp is the interpreter that had its limit
exceeded.</p>

<p>The deleteProc argument to Tcl_LimitAddHandler is a
function to call to delete the clientData value. It may be
TCL_STATIC or NULL if no dele- tion action is necessary, or
TCL_DYNAMIC if all that is necessary is to free the
structure with Tcl_Free. Otherwise, it should refer to a
function with the following prototype:</p>

<p>typedef void Tcl_LimitHandlerDeleteProc( ClientData
clientData);</p>

<p>A limit handler may be deleted using
Tcl_LimitRemoveHandler; the han- dler removed will be the
first one found (out of the handlers added with
Tcl_LimitAddHandler) with exactly matching type, handlerProc
and clientData arguments. This function always invokes the
deleteProc on the clientData (unless the deleteProc was NULL
or TCL_STATIC).</p>
