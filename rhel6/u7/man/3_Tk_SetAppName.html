<p>Tk_SetAppName(3) Tk Library Procedures
Tk_SetAppName(3)</p>


<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME Tk_SetAppName - Set the name of an application for
send commands</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tk.h&gt;</p>

<p>const char * Tk_SetAppName(tkwin, name)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS Tk_Window tkwin (in) Token for window in
application. Used only to select a particular
application.</p>

<p>const char *name (in) Name under which to register the
appli- cation.
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Tk_SetAppName associates a name with a given
application and records that association on the display
containing with the applications main window. After this
procedure has been invoked, other applications on the
display will be able to use the send command to invoke
operations in the application. If name is already in use by
some other applica- tion on the display, then a new name
will be generated by appending #2 to name; if this name is
also in use, the number will be incre- mented until an
unused name is found. The return value from the proce- dure
is a pointer to the name actually used.</p>

<p>If the application already has a name when Tk_SetAppName
is called, then the new name replaces the old name.</p>

<p>Tk_SetAppName also adds a send command to the
applications inter- preter, which can be used to send
commands from this application to others on any of the
displays where the application has windows.</p>

<p>The application s name registration persists until the
interpreter is deleted or the send command is deleted from
interp, at which point the name is automatically
unregistered and the application becomes inacces- sible via
send. The application can be made accessible again by call-
ing Tk_SetAppName.</p>

<p>Tk_SetAppName is called automatically by Tk_Init, so
applications do not normally need to call it explicitly.</p>

<p>The command tk appname provides Tcl-level access to the
functionality of Tk_SetAppName.</p>

<p>KEYWORDS application, name, register, send command</p>
