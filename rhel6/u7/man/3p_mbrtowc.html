<p>MBRTOWC(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual MBRTOWC(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME mbrtowc - convert a character to a wide-character
code (restartable)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;wchar.h&gt;</p>

<p>size_t mbrtowc(wchar_t *restrict pwc, const char
*restrict s, size_t n, mbstate_t *restrict ps);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION If s is a null pointer, the mbrtowc()
function shall be equivalent to the call:</p>

<p>mbrtowc(NULL, &quot;&quot;, 1, ps)</p>

<p>In this case, the values of the arguments pwc and n are
ignored.</p>

<p>If s is not a null pointer, the mbrtowc() function shall
inspect at most n bytes beginning at the byte pointed to by
s to determine the number of bytes needed to complete the
next character (including any shift sequences). If the
function determines that the next character is completed, it
shall determine the value of the corresponding wide char-
acter and then, if pwc is not a null pointer, shall store
that value in the object pointed to by pwc. If the
corresponding wide character is the null wide character, the
resulting state described shall be the initial conversion
state.</p>

<p>If ps is a null pointer, the mbrtowc() function shall
use its own internal mbstate_t object, which shall be
initialized at program start- up to the initial conversion
state. Otherwise, the mbstate_t object pointed to by ps
shall be used to completely describe the current con-
version state of the associated character sequence. The
implementation shall behave as if no function defined in
this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 calls mbrtowc().</p>

<p>The behavior of this function is affected by the
LC_CTYPE category of the current locale.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The mbrtowc() function shall return the
first of the following that applies:</p>

<p>0 If the next n or fewer bytes complete the character
that corre- sponds to the null wide character (which is the
value stored).</p>

<p>between 1 and n inclusive</p>

<p>If the next n or fewer bytes complete a valid character
(which is the value stored); the value returned shall be the
number of bytes that complete the character.</p>

<p>(size_t)-2 If the next n bytes contribute to an
incomplete but potentially valid character, and all n bytes
have been processed (no value is stored). When n has at
least the value of the {MB_CUR_MAX} macro, this case can
only occur if s points at a sequence of redundant shift
sequences (for implementations with state-depen- dent
encodings).</p>

<p>(size_t)-1 If an encoding error occurs, in which case
the next n or fewer bytes do not contribute to a complete
and valid character (no value is stored). In this case,
[EILSEQ] shall be stored in errno and the conversion state
is undefined.</p>

<p>ERRORS The mbrtowc() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL ps points to an object that contains an invalid
conversion state.</p>

<p>EILSEQ Invalid character sequence is detected.</p>
