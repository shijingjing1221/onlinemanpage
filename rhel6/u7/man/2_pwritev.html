<p>READV(2) Linux Programmer s Manual READV(2)</p>

<p>NAME readv, writev, preadv, pwritev - read or write data
into multiple buffers</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/uio.h&gt;</p>

<p>ssize_t readv(int fd, const struct iovec *iov, int
iovcnt);</p>

<p>ssize_t writev(int fd, const struct iovec *iov, int
iovcnt);</p>

<p>ssize_t preadv(int fd, const struct iovec *iov, int
iovcnt, off_t offset);</p>

<p>ssize_t pwritev(int fd, const struct iovec *iov, int
iovcnt, off_t offset);</p>

<p>Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
feature_test_macros(7)):</p>

<p>preadv(), pwritev(): _BSD_SOURCE</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The readv() system call reads iovcnt buffers
from the file associated with the file descriptor fd into
the buffers described by iov (&quot;scatter
input&quot;).</p>

<p>The writev() system call writes iovcnt buffers of data
described by iov to the file associated with the file
descriptor fd (&quot;gather output&quot;).</p>

<p>The pointer iov points to an array of iovec structures,
defined in &lt;sys/uio.h&gt; as:</p>

<p>struct iovec { void *iov_base; /* Starting address */
size_t iov_len; /* Number of bytes to transfer */ };</p>

<p>The readv() system call works just like read(2) except
that multiple buffers are filled.</p>

<p>The writev() system call works just like write(2) except
that multiple buffers are written out.</p>

<p>Buffers are processed in array order. This means that
readv() com- pletely fills iov[0] before proceeding to
iov[1], and so on. (If there is insufficient data, then not
all buffers pointed to by iov may be filled.) Similarly,
writev() writes out the entire contents of iov[0] before
proceeding to iov[1], and so on.</p>

<p>The data transfers performed by readv() and writev() are
atomic: the data written by writev() is written as a single
block that is not intermingled with output from writes in
other processes (but see pipe(7) for an exception);
analogously, readv() is guaranteed to read a contiguous
block of data from the file, regardless of read operations
performed in other threads or processes that have file
descriptors referring to the same open file description (see
open(2)).</p>

<p>preadv() and pwritev() The preadv() system call combines
the functionality of readv() and pread(2). It performs the
same task as readv(), but adds a fourth argument, offset,
which specifies the file offset at which the input operation
is to be performed.</p>

<p>The pwritev() system call combines the functionality of
writev() and pwrite(2). It performs the same task as
writev(), but adds a fourth argument, offset, which
specifies the file offset at which the output operation is
to be performed.</p>

<p>The file offset is not changed by these system calls.
The file referred to by fd must be capable of seeking.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, readv() and preadv() return the
number of bytes read; writev() and pwritev() return the
number of bytes written. On error, -1 is returned, and errno
is set appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS The errors are as given for read(2) and write(2).
Furthermore, preadv() and pwritev() can also fail for the
same reasons as lseek(2). Additionally, the following error
is defined:</p>

<p>EINVAL The sum of the iov_len values overflows an
ssize_t value. Or, the vector count iovcnt is less than zero
or greater than the permitted maximum.</p>

<p>VERSIONS preadv() and pwritev() first appeared in Linux
2.6.30; library support was added in glibc 2.10.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO readv(), writev(): 4.4BSD (these system
calls first appeared in 4.2BSD), POSIX.1-2001. Linux libc5
used size_t as the type of the iovcnt argument, and int as
the return type.</p>

<p>preadv(), pwritev(): nonstandard, but present also on
the modern BSDs.</p>

<p>NOTES Linux Notes POSIX.1-2001 allows an implementation
to place a limit on the number of items that can be passed
in iov. An implementation can advertise its limit by
defining IOV_MAX in &lt;limits.h&gt; or at run time via the
return value from sysconf(_SC_IOV_MAX). On Linux, the limit
advertised by these mechanisms is 1024, which is the true
kernel limit. However, the glibc wrapper functions do some
extra work if they detect that the underlying kernel system
call failed because this limit was exceeded. In the case of
readv() the wrapper function allocates a temporary buffer
large enough for all of the items specified by iov, passes
that buffer in a call to read(2), copies data from the
buffer to the loca- tions specified by the iov_base fields
of the elements of iov, and then frees the buffer. The
wrapper function for writev() performs the anal- ogous task
using a temporary buffer and a call to write(2).</p>

<p>BUGS It is not advisable to mix calls to readv() or
writev(), which operate on file descriptors, with the
functions from the stdio library; the results will be
undefined and probably not what you want.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE The following code sample demonstrates the use
of writev():</p>

<p>char *str0 = &quot;hello &quot;; char *str1 =
&quot;world0; struct iovec iov[2]; ssize_t nwritten;</p>

<p>iov[0].iov_base = str0; iov[0].iov_len = strlen(str0);
iov[1].iov_base = str1; iov[1].iov_len = strlen(str1);</p>

<p>nwritten = writev(STDOUT_FILENO, iov, 2);</p>
