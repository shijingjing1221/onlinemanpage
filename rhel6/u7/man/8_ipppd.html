<p>NAME ipppd - (ISDN) Point to Point Protocol daemon</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS /usr/sbin/ipppd [ options ] [ device ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) provides a
method for transmitting datagrams over serial point-to-point
links. PPP is composed of three parts: a method for
encapsulating datagrams over serial links, an extensible
Link Control Protocol (LCP), and a family of Network Control
Protocols (NCP) for establishing and configuring different
network- layer protocols.</p>

<p>The encapsulation scheme is provided by driver code in
the kernel. ipppd provides the basic LCP, authentication
support, and an NCP for establishing and configuring the
Internet Protocol (IP) (called the IP Control Protocol,
IPCP).</p>

<p>NOTES for (ISDN) IPPPD This special (ISDN) PPP daemon is
a modified version of pppd and pro- vides synchronous PPP
for ISDN connections.</p>

<p>If you need asynchronous PPP over ISDN lines use pppd
instead with the ISDN character devices, see ttyI(4).</p>

<p>The ipppd can handle multiple devices. This is necessary
to link sev- eral connections together to one bundle. ipppd
should be started once. It opens the devices and waits for
connections. If the connections is closed ipppd reopens the
device automatically (the device, thats it ... not the link
to the remote). So you shouldnt kill the ipppd to close a
link. Instead, trigger a hangup on the netdevice layer by
isdnctrl hangup &lt;device&gt;.</p>

<p>The facility to configure the daemon via file
/etc/ppp/ioptions.&lt;dev- name&gt; is disabled. The file
option or the command line may be used for individual
configuration.</p>

<p>Do not set the permissions of the program to setuid to
root on execu- tion . Call the daemon as root instead. No
common user should have the need to call the daemon!</p>

<p>OPTIONS &lt;device&gt; Communicate over the named
device. The string &quot;/dev/&quot; is prepended if
necessary. If no device name is given, or if the name of the
controlling terminal is given, ipppd will use the
controlling terminal, and will not fork to put itself in the
background.</p>

<p>&lt;local_IP_address&gt;:&lt;remote_IP_address&gt; Set
the local and/or remote interface IP addresses. Either one
may be omitted. The IP addresses can be specified with a
host name or in decimal dot notation (e.g. 150.234.56.78).
The default local address is the (first) IP address of the
system (unless the noipdefault option is given). The remote
address will be obtained from the peer if not specified in
any option. Thus, in simple cases, this option is not
required. If a local and/or remote IP address is specified
with this option, ipppd will not accept a different value
from the peer in the IPCP negotiation, unless the
ipcp-accept-local and/or ipcp-accept- remote options are
given, respectively.</p>

<p>active-filter filter-expression Specifies a packet
filter to be applied to data packets to determine which
packets are to be regarded as link activity, and therefore
reset the idle timer, or cause the link to be brought up in
demand-dialling mode. This option is useful in conjunction
with the idle option if there are packets being sent or
received regularly over the link (for example, routing
information pack- ets) which would otherwise prevent the
link from ever appearing to be idle. The filter-expression
syntax is as described for tcpdump(1), except that
qualifiers which are inappropriate for a PPP link, such as
ether and arp, are not permitted. Generally the filter
expression should be enclosed in single-quotes to prevent
whitespace in the expression from being interpreted by the
shell. This option is currently only available if both the
kernel and ipppd were compiled with IPPP_FILTER defined.</p>

<p>-ac Disable Address/Control compression negotiation (use
default, i.e. address/control field compression
disabled).</p>

<p>-all Dont request or allow negotiation of any options
for LCP and IPCP (use default values).</p>

<p>auth Require the peer to authenticate itself before
allowing network packets to be sent or received.</p>

<p>bsdcomp nr,nt Request that the peer compress packets
that it sends, using the BSD-Compress scheme, with a maximum
code size of nr bits, and agree to compress packets sent to
the peer with a maximum code size of nt bits. If nt is not
specified, it defaults to the value given for nr. Values in
the range 9 to 15 may be used for nr and nt; larger values
give better compression but consume more kernel memory for
compression dictionaries. Alternatively, a value of 0 for nr
or nt disables compression in the corre- sponding
direction.</p>

<p>-bsdcomp Disables compression; ipppd will not request or
agree to com- press packets using the BSD-Compress
scheme.</p>

<p>callback &lt;string&gt; Request the peer to call back at
the location given in &lt;string&gt;. Ususally this is a
phone number, but it may be interpreted dif- ferently (or
ignored) depending on the callback-type option. If
&lt;string&gt; is the empty string, ipppd automatically
tries to nego- tiate a callback type that does not need a
location to be speci- fied.</p>

<p>callback-delay &lt;n&gt; Callback delay for CBCP in
seconds. If callback is negotiated using CBCP, request that
the peer waits at least &lt;n&gt; seconds before calling
back. Ignored if callback is negotiated as speci- fied in
RFC 1570. Legal range is 0..255, default is 5.</p>

<p>callback-cbcp Enable callback negotiation via CBCB
(default).</p>

<p>-callback-cbcp Disable callback negotiation via
CBCB.</p>

<p>no-callback-cbcp Disable callback negotiation via
CBCB.</p>

<p>callback-cbcp-preferred If both CBCP and RFC 1570 style
callback negotiation is enabled, CBCP is preferred
(default)</p>

<p>callback-rfc1570-preferred If both CBCP and RFC 1570
style callback negotiation is enabled, RFC 1570 style is
preferred.</p>

<p>callback-rfc1570 Enable RFC 1570 style callback
negotiation (default).</p>

<p>-callback-rfc1570 Disable RFC 1570 style callback
negotiation.</p>

<p>no-callback-rfc1570 Disable RFC 1570 style callback
negotiation (default).</p>

<p>callback-type &lt;n&gt; Specifies how to interpret the
location identifier given as parameter of the callback
option. Legal values are 0..4. A value of 0 means that only
callback types should be negotiated that need no extra
location id. No location id is sent to the peer in this
case. For RFC 1570 style callback negotiation, the values
1..4 indicate how the peer should interpret the location
identi- fier: 1 - id is a system specific dial string, 2 -
id is used for database lookup by the peer, 3 - id is a
phone number, and 4 id is a name. For CBCP callback
negotiation, the location id is always interpreted as a
phone number.</p>

<p>-ccp Necessary for a few netblazers on the remote
side.</p>

<p>noccp same as -ccp</p>

<p>+chap Require the peer to authenticate itself using CHAP
[Crypto- graphic Handshake Authentication Protocol]
authentication.</p>

<p>-chap Dont agree to authenticate using CHAP.</p>

<p>chap-interval &lt;n&gt; If this option is given, ipppd
will rechallenge the peer every &lt;n&gt; seconds.</p>

<p>chap-max-challenge &lt;n&gt; Set the maximum number of
CHAP challenge transmissions to &lt;n&gt; (default 10).</p>

<p>chap-restart &lt;n&gt; Set the CHAP restart interval
(retransmission timeout for chal- lenges) to &lt;n&gt;
seconds (default 3).</p>

<p>debug Increase debugging level (same as -d). If this
option is given, ipppd will log the contents of all control
packets sent or received in a readable form. The packets are
logged through syslog with facility daemon and level debug.
This information can be directed to a file by setting up
/etc/syslog.conf appro- priately (see syslog.conf(5)).</p>

<p>-d Increase debugging level (same as the debug
option).</p>

<p>defaultroute Add a default route to the system routing
tables, using the peer as the gateway, when IPCP negotiation
is successfully completed. This entry is removed when the
PPP connection is broken.</p>

<p>-defaultroute Disable the defaultroute option. The
system administrator who wishes to prevent users from
creating default routes with ipppd can do so by placing this
option in the /etc/ppp/ioptions file.</p>

<p>deldefaultroute Replace default route if it already
exists. Together with the option defaultroute, this will
replace any existing default route by a new one through this
ipppds interface when it comes up.</p>

<p>-detach Dont fork to become a background process
(otherwise ipppd will do so if a serial device other than
its controlling terminal is specified).</p>

<p>domain &lt;d&gt; Append the domain name &lt;d&gt; to the
local host name for authenti- cation purposes. For example,
if gethostname() returns the name porsche, but the fully
qualified domain name is porsche.Quotron.COM, you would use
the domain option to set the domain name to Quotron.COM.</p>

<p>file &lt;f&gt; Read options from file &lt;f&gt; (the
format is described below).</p>

<p>-ip Disable IP address negotiation. If this option is
used, the remote IP address must be specified with an option
on the com- mand line or in an options file.</p>

<p>+ip-protocol Enable the IPCP and IP protocols. This is
the default condition. This option is only needed if the
default setting is -ip-proto- col.</p>

<p>-ip-protocol Disable the IPCP and IP protocols. This
should only be used if you know that you are using a client
which only understands IPX and you don t want to confuse the
client with the IPCP protocol.</p>

<p>+ipx-protocol Enable the IPXCP and IPX protocols. This
is the default condi- tion if your kernel supports IPX. This
option is only needed if the default setting is
-ipx-protocol. If your kernel does not support IPX then this
option will have no effect.</p>

<p>-ipx-protocol Disable the IPXCP and IPX protocols. This
should only be used if you know that you are using a client
which only understands IP and you don t want to confuse the
client with the IPXCP proto- col.</p>

<p>ipcp-accept-local With this option, ipppd will accept
the peers idea of our local IP address, even if the local IP
address was specified in an option.</p>

<p>ipcp-accept-remote With this option, ipppd will accept
the peers idea of its (remote) IP address, even if the
remote IP address was specified in an option.</p>

<p>ipcp-max-configure &lt;n&gt; Set the maximum number of
IPCP configure-request transmissions to &lt;n&gt; (default
10).</p>

<p>ipcp-max-failure &lt;n&gt; Set the maximum number of
IPCP configure-NAKs returned before starting to send
configure-Rejects instead to &lt;n&gt; (default 10).</p>

<p>ipcp-max-terminate &lt;n&gt; Set the maximum number of
IPCP terminate-request transmissions to &lt;n&gt; (default
3).</p>

<p>ipcp-restart &lt;n&gt; Set the IPCP restart interval
(retransmission timeout) to &lt;n&gt; seconds (default
3).</p>

<p>ipparam string Provides an extra parameter to the ip-up
and ip-down scripts. If this option is given, the string
supplied is given as the 6th parameter to those scripts.</p>

<p>ipx-network &lt;n&gt; Set the IPX network number in the
IPXCP configure request frame to &lt;n&gt;. There is no
valid default. If this option is not speci- fied then the
network number is obtained from the peer. If the peer does
not have the network number, the IPX protocol will not be
started. This is a hexadecimal number and is entered without
any leading sequence such as 0x. It is related to the ipxcp-
accept-network option.</p>

<p>ipx-node &lt;n&gt;:&lt;m&gt; Set the IPX node numbers.
The two node numbers are separated from each other with a
colon character. The first number &lt;n&gt; is the local
node number. The second number &lt;m&gt; is the peers node
number. Each node number is a hexadecimal number, to the
maximum of ten significant digits. The node numbers on the
ipx-network must be unique. There is no valid default. If
this option is not specified then the node number is
obtained from the peer. This option is a related to the
ipxcp-accept-local and ipxcp-accept- remote options.</p>

<p>ipx-router-name &lt;string&gt; Set the name of the
router. This is a string and is sent to the peer as
information data.</p>

<p>ipx-routing &lt;n&gt; Set the routing protocol to be
received by this option. Use a comma-serperated list if you
want to specify more than one pro- tocol. The none option
(0) may be specified as the only instance of ipx-routing.
The values may be 0 for NONE, 2 for RIP/SAP, and 4 for
NLSP.</p>

<p>ipxcp-accept-local Accept the peers NAK for the node
number specified in the ipx- node option. If a node number
was specified, and non-zero, the default is to insist that
the value be used. If you include this option then you will
permit the peer to override the entry of the node
number.</p>

<p>ipxcp-accept-network Accept the peers NAK for the
network number specified in the ipx-network option. If a
network number was specified, and non- zero, the default is
to insist that the value be used. If you include this option
then you will permit the peer to override the entry of the
node number.</p>

<p>ipxcp-accept-remote Use the peer s network number
specified in the configure request frame. If a node number
was specified for the peer and this option was not
specified, the peer will be forced to use the value which
you have specified.</p>

<p>ipxcp-max-configure &lt;n&gt; Set the maximum number of
IPXCP configure request frames which the system will send to
&lt;n&gt;. The default is 10.</p>

<p>ipxcp-max-failure &lt;n&gt; Set the maximum number of
IPXCP NAK frames which the local sys- tem will send before
it rejects the options. The default value is 3.</p>

<p>ipxcp-max-terminate &lt;n&gt; Set the maximum nuber of
IPXCP terminate request frames before the local system
considers that the peer is not listening to them. The
default value is 3.</p>

<p>kdebug n Enable debugging code in the kernel-level PPP
driver. The argu- ment n is a number which is the sum of the
following values: 1 to enable general debug messages, 2 to
request that the contents of received packets be printed,
and 4 to request that the con- tents of transmitted packets
be printed.</p>

<p>lcp-echo-failure &lt;n&gt; If this option is given,
ipppd will presume the peer to be dead if n LCP
echo-requests are sent without receiving a valid LCP
echo-reply. If this happens, ipppd will terminate the
connec- tion. Use of this option requires a non-zero value
for the lcp- echo-interval parameter. This option can be
used to enable ipppd to terminate after the physical
connection has been broken (e.g., the line hung up) in
situations where no hardware modem control lines are
available.</p>

<p>lcp-echo-interval &lt;n&gt; If this option is given,
ipppd will send an LCP echo-request frame to the peer every
n seconds. With Linux, the echo-request is sent when no
packets have been received from the peer for n seconds.
Normally the peer should respond to the echo-request by
sending an echo-reply. This option can be used with the lcp-
echo-failure option to detect that the peer is no longer
con- nected.</p>

<p>lcp-max-configure &lt;n&gt; Set the maximum number of
LCP configure-request transmissions to &lt;n&gt; (default
10).</p>

<p>lcp-max-failure &lt;n&gt; Set the maximum number of LCP
configure-NAKs returned before starting to send
configure-Rejects instead to &lt;n&gt; (default 10).</p>

<p>lcp-max-terminate &lt;n&gt; Set the maximum number of
LCP terminate-request transmissions to &lt;n&gt; (default
3).</p>

<p>lcp-restart &lt;n&gt; Set the LCP restart interval
(retransmission timeout) to &lt;n&gt; seconds (default
3).</p>

<p>lock Specifies that ipppd should create a UUCP-style
lock file for the serial device to ensure exclusive access
to the device.</p>

<p>login Use the system password database for
authenticating the peer using PAP, and record the user in
the system wtmp file.</p>

<p>-mn Disable magic number negotiation. With this option,
ipppd can- not detect a looped-back line.</p>

<p>+mp enables MPPP negotiation</p>

<p>mru &lt;n&gt; Set the MRU [Maximum Receive Unit] value
to &lt;n&gt; for negotiation. ipppd will ask the peer to
send packets of no more than &lt;n&gt; bytes. The minimum
MRU value is 128. The default MRU value is 1500. A value of
296 is recommended for slow links (40 bytes for TCP/IP
header + 256 bytes of data).</p>

<p>-mru Disable MRU [Maximum Receive Unit] negotiation.
With this option, ipppd will use the default MRU value of
1500 bytes.</p>

<p>ms-dns &lt;n&gt; This option sets the IP address or
addresses for the Domain Name Server. It is used by
Microsoft Windows clients. The primary DNS address is
specified by the first instance of the ms-dns option. The
secondary is specified by the second instance.</p>

<p>ms-get-dns Implements the client side of RFC1877. If
ipppd is acting as a client to a server that implements
RFC1877 such as one intended to be used with Microsoft
Windows clients, this option allows ipppd to obtain one or
two DNS (Domain Name Server) addresses from the server. It
does not do anything with these addresses except put them in
the environment (MS_DNS1 MS_DNS2) that is passed to scripts.
For compatibility with the async pppd, DNS1 DNS2 environment
variables are also set. A sample resolv.conf is created in
/etc/ppp/resolv.conf. The /etc/ppp/ip-up script should use
this information to perform whatever adjustment is
necessary. Note: RFC1877 is a horrible protocol layering
viola- tion, the correct approach would be to use DHCP after
the IPCP phase.</p>

<p>ms-get-wins As ms-get-dns but for WINS (Windows Internet
Name Services) server addresses. Environment variables are
MS_WINS1 and MS_WINS2.</p>

<p>mtu &lt;n&gt; Set the MTU [Maximum Transmit Unit] value
to &lt;n&gt;. Unless the peer requests a smaller value via
MRU negotiation, ipppd will request that the kernel
networking code send data packets of no more than n bytes
through the PPP network interface.</p>

<p>name &lt;n&gt; Set the name of the local system for
authentication purposes to &lt;n&gt;.</p>

<p>netmask &lt;n&gt; Set the interface netmask to
&lt;n&gt;, a 32 bit netmask in &quot;decimal dot&quot;
notation (e.g. 255.255.255.0). If this option is given, the
value specified is ORed with the default netmask. The
default netmask is chosen based on the negotiated remote IP
address; it is the appropriate network mask for the class of
the remote IP address, ORed with the netmasks for any non
point-to- point network interfaces in the system which are
on the same network.</p>

<p>noipdefault Disables the default behaviour when no local
IP address is spec- ified, which is to determine (if
possible) the local IP address from the hostname. With this
option, the peer will have to sup- ply the local IP address
during IPCP negotiation (unless it specified explicitly on
the command line or in an options file).</p>

<p>passive Enables the &quot;passive&quot; option in the
LCP. With this option, ipppd will attempt to initiate a
connection; if no reply is received from the peer, ipppd
will then just wait passively for a valid LCP packet from
the peer (instead of exiting, as it does without this
option).</p>

<p>-p Same as the passive option.</p>

<p>+pap Require the peer to authenticate itself using
PAP.</p>

<p>-pap Dont agree to authenticate using PAP.</p>

<p>papcrypt Indicates that all secrets in the
/etc/ppp/pap-secrets file which are used for checking the
identity of the peer are encrypted, and thus ipppd should
not accept a password which (before encryption) is identical
to the secret from the /etc/ppp/pap-secrets file.</p>

<p>pap-max-authreq &lt;n&gt; Set the maximum number of PAP
authenticate-request transmissions to &lt;n&gt; (default
10).</p>

<p>pap-restart &lt;n&gt; Set the PAP restart interval
(retransmission timeout) to &lt;n&gt; seconds (default
3).</p>

<p>pap-timeout &lt;n&gt; Set the maximum time that ipppd
will wait for the peer to authenticate itself with PAP to
&lt;n&gt; seconds (0 means no limit).</p>

<p>pass-filter filter-expression Specifies a packet filter
to applied to data packets being sent or received to
determine which packets should be allowed to pass. Packets
which are rejected by the filter are silently discarded.
This option can be used to prevent specific network daemons
(such as routed) using up link bandwidth, or to provide a
basic firewall capability. The filter-expression syntax is
as described for tcpdump(1), except that qualifiers which
are inap- propriate for a PPP link, such as ether and arp,
are not permit- ted. Generally the filter expression should
be enclosed in sin- gle-quotes to prevent whitespace in the
expression from being interpreted by the shell. Note that it
is possible to apply dif- ferent constraints to incoming and
outgoing packets using the inbound and outbound qualifiers.
This option is currently only available if both the kernel
and ipppd were compiled with IPPP_FILTER defined.</p>

<p>-pc Disable protocol field compression negotiation (use
default, i.e. protocol field compression disabled).</p>

<p>pidfile &lt;filename&gt; Use &lt;filename&gt; instead of
/var/run/ipppd.pid</p>

<p>pred1comp Attempt to request that the peer send the
local system frames which have been compressed by the
Predictor-1 compression. The compression protocols must be
loaded or this option will be ignored.</p>

<p>-pred1comp Do not accept Predictor-1 comprssion, even if
the peer wants to send this type of compression and support
has been defined in the kernel.</p>

<p>proxyarp Add an entry to this system s ARP [Address
Resolution Protocol] table with the IP address of the peer
and the Ethernet address of this system.</p>

<p>-proxyarp Disable the proxyarp option. The system
administrator who wishes to prevent users from creating
proxy ARP entries with ipppd can do so by placing this
option in the /etc/ppp/ioptions file.</p>

<p>remotename &lt;n&gt; Set the assumed name of the remote
system for authentication purposes to &lt;n&gt;.</p>

<p>set_userip You may define valid IPs in
/etc/ppp/useriptab</p>

<p>silent With this option, ipppd will not transmit LCP
packets to initi- ate a connection until a valid LCP packet
is received from the peer (as for the passive option with
ancient versions of ipppd).</p>

<p>+ua &lt;p&gt; Agree to authenticate using PAP [Password
Authentication Proto- col] if requested by the peer, and use
the data in file &lt;p&gt; for the user and password to send
to the peer. The file contains the remote user name,
followed by a newline, followed by the remote password,
followed by a newline. This option is obsolescent.</p>

<p>usefirstip Gets the remote address from the first entry
in the auth file (if there is an IP address entry). This
address should be a full IP address not an address from a
masked area. Ipppd calls gethostbyname() and negotiates the
result. IP from auth file will overwrite the remote address
gotten from the interface. usefirstip is UNTESTED!</p>

<p>usehostname Enforce the use of the hostname as the name
of the local system for authentication purposes (overrides
the name option).</p>

<p>usepeerdns Same as ms-get-dns for compatibility with
async pppd.</p>

<p>user &lt;u&gt; Set the user name to use for
authenticating this machine with the peer using PAP to
&lt;u&gt;.</p>

<p>useifip will get (if not set to 0.0.0.0) the IP address
for the negotia- tion from the attached network-interface.
(also: ipppd will try to negotiate pointopoint IP as remote
IP) interface address -&gt; local IP pointopoint address
-&gt; remote IP</p>

<p>-vj Disable negotiation of Van Jacobson style TCP/IP
header compres- sion (use default, i.e. no compression).</p>

<p>-vjccomp Disable the connection-ID compression option in
Van Jacobson style TCP/IP header compression. With this
option, ipppd will not omit the connection-ID byte from Van
Jacobson compressed TCP/IP headers, nor ask the peer to do
so.</p>

<p>vj-max-slots n Sets the number of connection slots to be
used by the Van Jacob- son TCP/IP header compression and
decompression code to n, which must be between 2 and 16
(inclusive).</p>

<p>OPTIONS FILES Options can be taken from files as well as
the command line. ipppd reads options from the file
/etc/ppp/ioptions before looking at the command line. An
options file is parsed into a series of words, delim- ited
by whitespace. Whitespace can be included in a word by
enclosing the word in quotes (&quot;). A backslash ( quotes
the following charac- ter. A hash (#) starts a comment,
which continues until the end of the line.</p>

<p>AUTHENTICATION ipppd provides system administrators with
sufficient access control that PPP access to a server
machine can be provided to legitimate users without fear of
compromising the security of the server or the network its
on. In part this is provided by the /etc/ppp/ioptions file,
where the administrator can place options to require
authentication whenever ipppd is run, and in part by the PAP
and CHAP secrets files, where the administrator can restrict
the set of IP addresses which individual users may use.</p>

<p>The default behaviour of ipppd is to agree to
authenticate if requested, and to not require authentication
from the peer. However, ipppd will not agree to authenticate
itself with a particular protocol if it has no secrets which
could be used to do so.</p>

<p>Authentication is based on secrets, which are selected
from secrets files (/etc/ppp/pap-secrets for PAP,
/etc/ppp/chap-secrets for CHAP). Both secrets files have the
same format, and both can store secrets for several
combinations of server (authenticating peer) and client
(peer being authenticated). Note that ipppd can be both a
server and client, and that different protocols can be used
in the two directions if desired.</p>

<p>A secrets file is parsed into words as for a options
file. A secret is specified by a line containing at least 3
words, in the order client name, server name, secret. Any
following words on the same line are taken to be a list of
acceptable IP addresses for that client. If there are only 3
words on the line, it is assumed that any IP address is OK;
to disallow all IP addresses, use &quot;-&quot;. If the
secret starts with an @, what follows is assumed to be the
name of a file from which to read the secret. A
&quot;*&quot; as the client or server name matches any name.
When selecting a secret, ipppd takes the best match, i.e.
the match with the fewest wildcards.</p>

<p>Thus a secrets file contains both secrets for use in
authenticating other hosts, plus secrets which we use for
authenticating ourselves to others. Which secret to use is
chosen based on the names of the host (the local name ) and
its peer (the remote name). The local name is set as
follows:</p>

<p>if the usehostname option is given, then the local name
is the hostname of this machine (with the domain appended,
if given)</p>

<p>else if the name option is given, then use the argument
of the first name option seen</p>

<p>else if the local IP address is specified with a
hostname, then use that name</p>

<p>else use the hostname of this machine (with the domain
appended, if given)</p>

<p>When authenticating ourselves using PAP, there is also a
username which is the local name by default, but can be set
with the user option or the +ua option.</p>

<p>The remote name is set as follows:</p>

<p>if the remotename option is given, then use the argument
of the last remotename option seen</p>

<p>else if the remote IP address is specified with a
hostname, then use that host name</p>

<p>else the remote name is the null string
&quot;&quot;.</p>

<p>Secrets are selected from the PAP secrets file as
follows:</p>

<p>* For authenticating the peer, look for a secret with
client == user- name specified in the PAP
authenticate-request, and server == local name.</p>

<p>* For authenticating ourselves to the peer, look for a
secret with client == our username, server == remote
name.</p>

<p>When authenticating the peer with PAP, a secret of
&quot;&quot; matches any pass- word supplied by the peer. If
the password doesnt match the secret, the password is
encrypted using crypt() and checked against the secret
again; thus secrets for authenticating the peer can be
stored in encrypted form. If the papcrypt option is given,
the first (unen- crypted) comparison is omitted, for better
security.</p>

<p>If the login option was specified, the username and
password are also checked against the system password
database. Thus, the system admin- istrator can set up the
pap-secrets file to allow PPP access only to certain users,
and to restrict the set of IP addresses that each user can
use. Typically, when using the login option, the secret in
/etc/ppp/pap-secrets would be &quot;&quot;, to avoid the
need to have the same secret in two places.</p>

<p>Secrets are selected from the CHAP secrets file as
follows:</p>

<p>* For authenticating the peer, look for a secret with
client == name specified in the CHAP-Response message, and
server == local name.</p>

<p>* For authenticating ourselves to the peer, look for a
secret with client == local name, and server == name
specified in the CHAP-Chal- lenge message.</p>

<p>Authentication must be satisfactorily completed before
IPCP (or any other Network Control Protocol) can be started.
If authentication fails, ipppd will terminated the link (by
closing LCP). If IPCP nego- tiates an unacceptable IP
address for the remote host, IPCP will be closed. IP packets
can only be sent or received when IPCP is open.</p>

<p>In some cases it is desirable to allow some hosts which
cant authenti- cate themselves to connect and use one of a
restricted set of IP addresses, even when the local host
generally requires authentication. If the peer refuses to
authenticate itself when requested, ipppd takes that as
equivalent to authenticating with PAP using the empty string
for the username and password. Thus, by adding a line to the
pap- secrets file which specifies the empty string for the
client and pass- word, it is possible to allow restricted
access to hosts which refuse to authenticate themselves.</p>

<p>ROUTING When IPCP negotiation is completed successfully,
ipppd will inform the kernel of the local and remote IP
addresses for the ppp interface. This is sufficient to
create a host route to the remote end of the link, which
will enable the peers to exchange IP packets. Communica-
tion with other machines generally requires further
modification to routing tables and/or ARP (Address
Resolution Protocol) tables. In some cases this will be done
automatically through the actions of the routed or gated
daemons, but in most cases some further intervention is
required.</p>

<p>Sometimes it is desirable to add a default route through
the remote host, as in the case of a machine whose only
connection to the Internet is through the ppp interface. The
defaultroute option causes ipppd to create such a default
route when IPCP comes up, and delete it when the link is
terminated.</p>

<p>In some cases it is desirable to use proxy ARP, for
example on a server machine connected to a LAN, in order to
allow other hosts to communi- cate with the remote host. The
proxyarp option causes ipppd to look for a network interface
on the same subnet as the remote host (an interface
supporting broadcast and ARP, which is up and not a
point-to- point or loopback interface). If found, ipppd
creates a permanent, published ARP entry with the IP address
of the remote host and the hardware address of the network
interface found.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS Messages are sent to the syslog daemon using
facility LOG_DAEMON. (This can be overriden by recompiling
ipppd with the macro LOG_PPP defined as the desired
facility.) In order to see the error and debug messages, you
will need to edit your /etc/syslog.conf file to direct the
messages to the desired output device or file.</p>

<p>The debug option causes the contents of all control
packets sent or received to be logged, that is, all LCP,
PAP, CHAP or IPCP packets. This can be useful if the PPP
negotiation does not succeed. If debugging is enabled at
compile time, the debug option also causes other debugging
messages to be logged.</p>

<p>Debugging can also be enabled or disabled by sending a
SIGUSR1 to the ipppd process. This signal acts as a
toggle.</p>

<p>FILES /var/run/ipppd.pid Process-ID for ipppd process on
ppp interface unit n.</p>

<p>/etc/ppp/ip-up A program or script which is executed
when the link is available for sending and receiving IP
packets (that is, IPCP has come up). It is executed with the
parameters</p>

<p>interface-name tty-device speed local-IP-address
remote-IP- address</p>

<p>and with its standard input, output and error streams
redirected to /dev/null.</p>

<p>This program or script is executed with the same real
and effec- tive user-ID as ipppd, that is, at least the
effective user-ID and possibly the real user-ID will be
root. This is so that it can be used to manipulate routes,
run privileged daemons (e.g. sendmail), etc. Be careful that
the contents of the /etc/ppp/ip-up and /etc/ppp/ip-down
scripts do not compromise your systems security.</p>

<p>/etc/ppp/ip-down A program or script which is executed
when the link is no longer available for sending and
receiving IP packets. This script can be used for undoing
the effects of the /etc/ppp/ip-up script. It is invoked with
the same parameters as the ip-up script, and the same
security considerations apply, since it is executed with the
same effective and real user-IDs as ipppd.</p>

<p>/etc/ppp/ipx-up A program or script which is executed
when the link is available for sending and receiving IPX
packets (that is, IPXCP has come up). It is executed with
the parameters</p>

<p>interface-name tty-device speed network-number
local-IPX-node- address remote-IPX-node-address
local-IPX-routing-protocol remote-IPX-routing-protocol
local-IPX-router-name remote-IPX- router-name ipparam
ipppd-pid</p>

<p>and with its standard input, output and error streams
redirected to /dev/null.</p>

<p>The local-IPX-routing-protocol and
remote-IPX-routing-protocol field may be one of the
following:</p>

<p>NONE to indicate that there is no routing protocol RIP
to indicate that RIP/SAP should be used NLSP to indicate
that Novell NLSP should be used RIP NLSP to indicate that
both RIP/SAP and NLSP should be used</p>

<p>This program or script is executed with the same real
and effec- tive user-ID as ipppd, that is, at least the
effective user-ID and possibly the real user-ID will be
root. This is so that it can be used to manipulate routes,
run privileged daemons (e.g. ripd), etc. Be careful that the
contents of the /etc/ppp/ipx-up and /etc/ppp/ipx-down
scripts do not compromise your systems security.</p>

<p>/etc/ppp/ipx-down A program or script which is executed
when the link is no longer available for sending and
receiving IPX packets. This script can be used for undoing
the effects of the /etc/ppp/ipx-up script. It is invoked
with the same parameters as the ipx-up script, and the same
security considerations apply, since it is executed with the
same effective and real user-IDs as ipppd.</p>

<p>/etc/ppp/auth-up This program or script is executed
after successful authentica- tion with the following
parameters: interface name, authentica- tion user name,
username of ipppd, devicename, speed, remote number</p>

<p>/etc/ppp/auth-down This program or script is executed
after a disconnection with the following parameters:
interface name, authentication user name, username of ipppd,
devicename, speed, remote number</p>

<p>/etc/ppp/auth-fail This program or script is executed
after a authentication fail- ure with the following
parameters: interface name, authentica- tion user name,
username of ipppd, devicename, speed, remote number, failure
reason Valid reasons are: 1 = Timeout during pap auth 2 =
pap protocol rejected 3 = pap secrets invalid 9 = Timeout
during chap auth 10 = chap protocol rejected 11 = chap
secrets invalid</p>

<p>/etc/ppp/pap-secrets Usernames, passwords and IP
addresses for PAP authentication.</p>

<p>/etc/ppp/chap-secrets Names, secrets and IP addresses
for CHAP authentication.</p>

<p>NOTES The following signals have the specified effect
when sent to the ipppd process.</p>

<p>SIGINT, SIGTERM These signals cause ipppd to terminate
the link (by closing LCP), restore the serial device
settings, and exit.</p>

<p>SIGHUP This signal causes ipppd to terminate the link,
restore the serial device settings, and close the serial
device. If the persist option has been specified, ipppd will
try to reopen the serial device and start another
connection. Otherwise ipppd will exit.</p>

<p>SIGUSR2 This signal causes ipppd to renegotiate
compression. This can be useful to re-enable compression
after it has been disabled as a result of a fatal
decompression error. With the BSD Compress scheme, fatal
decompression errors generally indicate a bug in one or
other implementation.</p>
