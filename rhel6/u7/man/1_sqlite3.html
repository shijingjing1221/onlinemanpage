<p>NAME sqlite3 - A command line interface for SQLite
version 3</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sqlite3 [options] [databasefile] [SQL]</p>

<p>SUMMARY sqlite3 is a terminal-based front-end to the
SQLite library that can evaluate queries interactively and
display the results in multiple for- mats. sqlite3 can also
be used within shell scripts and other applica- tions to
provide batch processing features.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION To start a sqlite3 interactive session,
invoke the sqlite3 command and optionally provide the name
of a database file. If the database file does not exist, it
will be created. If the database file does exist, it will be
opened.</p>

<p>For example, to create a new database file named
&quot;mydata.db&quot;, create a table named
&quot;memos&quot; and insert a couple of records into that
table:</p>

<p>$ sqlite3 mydata.db SQLite version 3.1.3 Enter
&quot;.help&quot; for instructions sqlite&gt; create table
memos(text, priority INTEGER); sqlite&gt; insert into memos
valuesdeliver project description , 10); sqlite&gt; insert
into memos valueslunch with Christin, 100); sqlite&gt;
select * from memos; deliver project description|10 lunch
with Christine|100 sqlite&gt;</p>

<p>If no database name is supplied, the ATTACH sql command
can be used to attach to existing or create new database
files. ATTACH can also be used to attach to multiple
databases within the same interactive ses- sion. This is
useful for migrating data between databases, possibly
changing the schema along the way.</p>

<p>Optionally, a SQL statement or set of SQL statements can
be supplied as a single argument. Multiple statements should
be separated by semi- colons.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>$ sqlite3 -line mydata.db select * from memos where
priority &gt; 20; text = lunch with Christine priority =
100</p>

<p>SQLITE META-COMMANDS The interactive interpreter offers
a set of meta-commands that can be used to control the
output format, examine the currently attached database
files, or perform administrative operations upon the
attached databases (such as rebuilding indices).
Meta-commands are always pre- fixed with a dot (.).</p>

<p>A list of available meta-commands can be viewed at any
time by issuing the .help command. For example:</p>

<p>sqlite&gt; .help .databases List names and files of
attached databases .dump ?TABLE? ... Dump the database in an
SQL text format .echo ON|OFF Turn command echo on or off
.exit Exit this program .explain ON|OFF Turn output mode
suitable for EXPLAIN on or off. .header(s) ON|OFF Turn
display of headers on or off .help Show this message .import
FILE TABLE Import data from FILE into TABLE .indices TABLE
Show names of all indices on TABLE .mode MODE ?TABLE? Set
output mode where MODE is one of: csv Comma-separated values
column Left-aligned columns. (See .width) html HTML
&lt;table&gt; code insert SQL insert statements for TABLE
line One value per line list Values delimited by .separator
string tabs Tab-separated values tcl TCL list elements
.nullvalue STRING Print STRING in place of NULL values
.output FILENAME Send output to FILENAME .output stdout Send
output to the screen .prompt MAIN CONTINUE Replace the
standard prompts .quit Exit this program .read FILENAME
Execute SQL in FILENAME .schema ?TABLE? Show the CREATE
statements .separator STRING Change separator used by output
mode and .import .show Show the current values for various
settings .tables ?PATTERN? List names of tables matching a
LIKE pattern .timeout MS Try opening locked tables for MS
milliseconds .width NUM NUM ... Set column widths for
&quot;column&quot; mode sqlite&gt;</p>

<p>OPTIONS sqlite3 has the following options:</p>

<p>-init file Read and execute commands from file , which
can contain a mix of SQL statements and meta-commands.</p>

<p>-echo Print commands before execution.</p>

<p>-[no]header Turn headers on or off.</p>

<p>-column Query results will be displayed in a table like
form, using whitespace characters to separate the columns
and align the out- put.</p>

<p>-html Query results will be output as simple HTML
tables.</p>

<p>-line Query results will be displayed with one value per
line, rows separated by a blank line. Designed to be easily
parsed by scripts or other programs</p>

<p>-list Query results will be displayed with the separator
(|, by default) character between each field value. The
default.</p>

<p>-separator separator Set output field separator. Default
is |.</p>

<p>-nullvalue string Set string used to represent NULL
values. Default is (empty string).</p>

<p>-version Show SQLite version.</p>

<p>-help Show help on options and exit.</p>

<p>INIT FILE sqlite3 reads an initialization file to set
the configuration of the interactive environment. Throughout
initialization, any previously specified setting can be
overridden. The sequence of initialization is as
follows:</p>

<p>o The default configuration is established as
follows:</p>

<p>mode = LIST separator = &quot;|&quot; main prompt =
&quot;sqlite&gt; &quot; continue prompt = &quot; ...&gt;
&quot;</p>

<p>o If the file ~/.sqliterc exists, it is processed first.
can be found in the users home directory, it is read and
processed. It should gen- erally only contain
meta-commands.</p>

<p>o If the -init option is present, the specified file is
processed.</p>

<p>o All other command line options are processed.</p>
