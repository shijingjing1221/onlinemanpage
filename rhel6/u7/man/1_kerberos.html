<p>NAME kerberos - introduction to the Kerberos system</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The Kerberos system authenticates individual
users in a network envi- ronment. After authenticating
yourself to Kerberos, you can use Ker- beros-enabled
programs without having to present passwords.</p>

<p>If you enter your username and kinit responds with this
message:</p>

<p>kinit(v5): Client not found in Kerberos database while
getting initial credentials</p>

<p>you haven t been registered as a Kerberos user. See your
system admin- istrator.</p>

<p>A Kerberos name usually contains three parts. The first
is the pri- mary, which is usually a users or services name.
The second is the instance, which in the case of a user is
usually null. Some users may have privileged instances,
however, such as root or admin. In the case of a service,
the instance is the fully qualified name of the machine on
which it runs; i.e. there can be an rlogin service running
on the machine ABC, which is different from the rlogin
service running on the machine XYZ. The third part of a
Kerberos name is the realm. The realm corresponds to the
Kerberos service providing authentication for the
principal.</p>

<p>When writing a Kerberos name, the principal name is
separated from the instance (if not null) by a slash, and
the realm (if not the local realm) follows, preceded by an @
sign. The following are examples of valid Kerberos
names:</p>

<p>david jennifer/admin joeuser@BLEEP.COM
cbrown/root@FUBAR.ORG</p>

<p>When you authenticate yourself with Kerberos you get an
initial Ker- beros ticket. (A Kerberos ticket is an
encrypted protocol message that provides authentication.)
Kerberos uses this ticket for network utili- ties such as
rlogin and rcp. The ticket transactions are done trans-
parently, so you don t have to worry about their
management.</p>

<p>Note, however, that tickets expire. Privileged tickets,
such as those with the instance root, expire in a few
minutes, while tickets that carry more ordinary privileges
may be good for several hours or a day, depending on the
installation s policy. If your login session extends beyond
the time limit, you will have to re-authenticate yourself to
Kerberos to get new tickets. Use the kinit command to
re-authenticate yourself.</p>

<p>If you use the kinit command to get your tickets, make
sure you use the kdestroy command to destroy your tickets
before you end your login ses- sion. You should put the
kdestroy command in your .logout file so that your tickets
will be destroyed automatically when you logout. For more
information about the kinit and kdestroy commands, see the
kinit(1) and kdestroy(1) manual pages.</p>

<p>Kerberos tickets can be forwarded. In order to forward
tickets, you must request forwardable tickets when you
kinit. Once you have for- wardable tickets, most Kerberos
programs have a command line option to forward them to the
remote host.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES Several environment variables
affect the operation of Kerberos-enabled programs. These
include:</p>

<p>KRB5CCNAME Specifies the location of the credential
cache, in the form TYPE:residual. If no type prefix is
present, the FILE type is assumed and residual is the
pathname of the cache file. A col- lection of multiple
caches may be used by specifying the DIR type and the
pathname of a private directory (which must already exist).
The default cache file is /tmp/krb5cc_uid where uid is the
decimal user ID of the user.</p>

<p>KRB5_KTNAME Specifies the location of the keytab file,
in the form TYPE:residual. If no type is present, the FILE
type is assumed and residual is the pathname of the keytab
file. The default keytab file is /etc/krb5.keytab.</p>

<p>KRB5_CONFIG Specifies the location of the Kerberos
configuration file. The default is /etc/krb5.conf.</p>

<p>KRB5_KDC_PROFILE Specifies the location of the KDC
configuration file, which con- tains additional
configuration directives for the Key Distribu- tion Center
daemon and associated programs. The default is
/var/kerberos/krb5kdc/kdc.conf.</p>

<p>KRB5RCACHETYPE Specifies the default type of replay
cache to use for servers. Valid types include
&quot;dfl&quot; for the normal file type and
&quot;none&quot; for no replay cache. KRB5RCACHEDIR
Specifies the default direc- tory for replay caches used by
servers. The default is the value of the TMPDIR environment
variable, or /var/tmp if TMPDIR is not set.</p>

<p>KRB5_TRACE Specifies a filename to write trace log
output to. Trace logs can help illuminate decisions made
internally by the Kerberos libraries. The default is not to
write trace log output any- where.</p>

<p>Most environment variables are disabled for certain
programs, such as login system programs and setuid programs,
which are designed to be secure when run within an untrusted
process environment.</p>
