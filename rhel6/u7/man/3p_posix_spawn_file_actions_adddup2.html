<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME posix_spawn_file_actions_adddup2 - add dup2 action
to spawn file actions object (ADVANCED REALTIME)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;spawn.h&gt;</p>

<p>int
posix_spawn_file_actions_adddup2(posix_spawn_file_actions_t
* file_actions, int fildes, int newfildes);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The posix_spawn_file_actions_adddup2()
function shall add a dup2() action to the object referenced
by file_actions that shall cause the file descriptor fildes
to be duplicated as newfildes (as if dup2( fildes,
newfildes) had been called) when a new process is spawned
using this file actions object.</p>

<p>A spawn file actions object is as defined in
posix_spawn_file_actions_addclose() .</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, the
posix_spawn_file_actions_adddup2() function shall return
zero; otherwise, an error number shall be returned to
indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The posix_spawn_file_actions_adddup2() function
shall fail if:</p>

<p>EBADF The value specified by fildes or newfildes is
negative or greater than or equal to {OPEN_MAX}.</p>

<p>ENOMEM Insufficient memory exists to add to the spawn
file actions object.</p>

<p>The posix_spawn_file_actions_adddup2() function may fail
if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The value specified by file_actions is
invalid.</p>

<p>It shall not be considered an error for the fildes
argument passed to the posix_spawn_file_actions_adddup2()
function to specify a file descriptor for which the
specified operation could not be performed at the time of
the call. Any such error will be detected when the associ-
ated file actions object is later used during a
posix_spawn() or posix_spawnp() operation.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The posix_spawn_file_actions_adddup2()
function is part of the Spawn option and need not be
provided on all implementations.</p>

<p>RATIONALE Refer to the RATIONALE in
posix_spawn_file_actions_addclose() .</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
