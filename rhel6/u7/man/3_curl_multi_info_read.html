<p>NAME curl_multi_info_read - read multi stack
informationals</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;curl/curl.h&gt;</p>

<p>CURLMsg *curl_multi_info_read( CURLM *multi_handle, int
*msgs_in_queue);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Ask the multi handle if there are any
messages/informationals from the individual transfers.
Messages may include informationals such as an error code
from the transfer or just the fact that a transfer is com-
pleted. More details on these should be written down as
well.</p>

<p>Repeated calls to this function will return a new struct
each time, until a NULL is returned as a signal that there
is no more to get at this point. The integer pointed to with
msgs_in_queue will contain the number of remaining messages
after this function was called.</p>

<p>When you fetch a message using this function, it is
removed from the internal queue so calling this function
again will not return the same message again. It will
instead return new messages at each new invoke until the
queue is emptied.</p>

<p>WARNING: The data the returned pointer points to will
not survive call- ing curl_multi_cleanup(3),
curl_multi_remove_handle(3) or curl_easy_cleanup(3).</p>

<p>The CURLMsg struct is very simple and only contains very
basic infor- mation. If more involved information is wanted,
the particular &quot;easy handle&quot; in present in that
struct and can thus be used in subsequent regular
curl_easy_getinfo(3) calls (or similar):</p>

<p>struct CURLMsg { CURLMSG msg; /* what this message means
*/ CURL *easy_handle; /* the handle it concerns */ union {
void *whatever; /* message-specific data */ CURLcode result;
/* return code for transfer */ } data; }; When msg is
CURLMSG_DONE, the message identifies a transfer that is
done, and then result contains the return code for the easy
handle that just completed.</p>

<p>At this point, there are no other msg types defined.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE A pointer to a filled-in struct, or NULL if
it failed or ran out of structs. It also writes the number
of messages left in the queue (after this read) in the
integer the second argument points to.</p>
