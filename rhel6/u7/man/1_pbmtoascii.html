<p>NAME pbmtoascii - convert a PBM image to ASCII
graphics</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pbmtoascii</p>

<p>[-1x2|-2x4]</p>

<p>[pbmfile]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pbmtoascii reads a PBM image as input and produces a
somewhat crude ASCII graphic image as output.</p>

<p>To convert back, use asciitopgm(1).</p>

<p>OPTIONS The -1x2 and -2x4 options give you two alternate
ways for the pixels to get mapped to characters. With 1x2,
the default, each character repre- sents a group of 1 pixel
across by 2 pixels down. With -2x4, each character
represents 2 pixels across by 4 pixels down. With the 1x2
mode you can see the individual pixels, so its useful for
previewing small images on a non-graphics terminal. The 2x4
mode lets you display larger images on a small display, but
it obscures pixel-level details. 2x4 mode is also good for
displaying PGM images:</p>

<p>pamscale -width 158 | pnmnorm | pamditherbw -threshold |
pbmtoascii -2x4</p>

<p>should give good results.</p>
