<p>SG_TURS(8) SG3_UTILS SG_TURS(8)</p>

<p>NAME sg_turs - send one or more SCSI TEST UNIT READY
commands</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sg_turs [--help] [--number=NUM] [--progress]
[--time] [--verbose] [--version] DEVICE</p>

<p>sg_turs [-n=NUM] [-p] [-t] [-v] [-V] DEVICE</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This utility sends one or more SCSI TEST
UNIT READY commands to the DEVICE. This may be useful for
timing the per command overhead. Note that TEST UNIT READY
has no associated data, just a 6 byte command and a returned
SCSI status value.</p>

<p>This utility supports two command line syntaxes, the
preferred one is shown first in the synopsis and explained
in this section. A later sec- tion on the old command line
syntax outlines the second group of options.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Arguments to long options are mandatory for
short options as well.</p>

<p>-h, --help print out the usage message then exit.</p>

<p>-n, --number=NUM performs TEST UNIT READY NUM times. If
not given defaults to 1. These suffix multipliers are
permitted: c C *1; w W *2; b B *512; k K KiB *1,024; KB
*1,000; m M MiB *1,048,576; MB *1,000,000; g G GiB
*1,073,741,824; and GB *1,000,000,000 . Also a suffix of the
form &quot;x&lt;n&gt;&quot; multiplies the leading number by
&lt;n&gt;. Alternatively a hex number may be given, prefixed
by either 0x or has a trailing h.</p>

<p>-O, --old switch to older style options.</p>

<p>-p, --progress show progress indication (a percentage)
if available. If --num- ber=NUM is given, NUM is greater
than 1 and an initial progress indication was detected then
this utility waits 30 seconds before subsequent checks.
Exits when NUM is reached or there are no more progress
indications. Ignores --time option. See NOTES section
below.</p>

<p>-t, --time after completing the requested number of TEST
UNIT READY com- mands, outputs the total duration and the
average number of com- mands executed per second.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose increase level or verbosity.</p>

<p>-V, --version print version string then exit.</p>

<p>NOTES The progress indication is optionally part of the
sense data. When a prior command that takes a long time to
complete (and typically pre- cludes other media access
commands) is still underway, the progress indication can be
used to determine how long before the device returns to its
normal state.</p>

<p>The SCSI FORMAT command for disks used with the IMMED
bit set is an example of an operation that takes a
significant amount of time and precludes other media access
during that time. The IMMED bit set instructs the FORMAT
command to return control to the application client once the
format has commenced (see SBC-3). Several long duration SCSI
commands associated with tape drives also use the progress
indica- tion (see SSC-3).</p>

<p>Early standards suggested that the SCSI TEST UNIT READY
command be used for polling the progress indication. More
recent standards seem to sug- gest the SCSI REQUEST SENSE
command should be used instead.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The exit status of sg_turs is 0 when it is
successful. Otherwise see the sg3_utils(8) man page.</p>

<p>OLDER COMMAND LINE OPTIONS The options in this section
were the only ones available prior to sg3_utils version 1.23
. In sg3_utils version 1.23 and later these older options
can be selected by either setting the SG3_UTILS_OLD_OPTS
environment variable or using --old (or -O) as the first
option.</p>

<p>-n=NUM performs TEST UNIT READY NUM times. If not given
defaults to 1. Equivalent to --number=NUM in the main
description.</p>

<p>-N switch to the newer style options.</p>

<p>-p show progress indication (a percentage) if available.
Equiva- lent to --progress in the main description.</p>

<p>-t after completing the requested number of TEST UNIT
READY com- mands, outputs the total duration and the average
number of com- mands executed per second. Equivalent to
--time in the main description.</p>

<p>-v increase level of verbosity.</p>

<p>-V print out version string then exit.</p>
