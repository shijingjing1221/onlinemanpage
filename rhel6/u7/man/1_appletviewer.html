<p>Name appletviewer - The Java Applet Viewer.</p>

<p>The appletviewer command allows you to run applets
outside of a web browser.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS appletviewer [ options ] urls ...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The appletviewer command connects to the
documents or resources desig- nated by urls and displays
each applet referenced by the documents in its own window.
Note: if the documents referred to by urls do not ref-
erence any applets with the OBJECT, EMBED, or APPLET tag,
then appletviewer does nothing. For details on the HTML tags
that appletviewer supports, see AppletViewer Tags @
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/tools/appletview-
ertags.html.</p>

<p>Note: The appletviewer is intended for development
purposes only. See About Sample / Test Applications and Code
for more information.</p>

<p>Note: The appletviewer requires encoded URLs according
to the escaping mechanism defined in RFC2396. Only encoded
URLs are supported. However, file names must be unencoded,
as specified in RFC2396.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -debug Starts the applet viewer in the Java
debugger, jdb(1), thus allowing you to debug the applets in
the document.</p>

<p>-encoding encoding name Specify the input HTML file
encoding name.</p>

<p>-Jjavaoption Passes through the string javaoption as a
single argument to the Java interpreter which runs the
appletviewer. The argument should not contain spaces.
Multiple argument words must all begin with the prefix -J,
which is stripped. This is useful for adjusting the
compilers execution environment or memory usage.</p>
