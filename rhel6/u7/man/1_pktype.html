<p>NAME pktype - verify and translate a packed font bitmap
file to plain text</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pktype pk_file [ output_file ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page is not meant to be
exhaustive. The complete documen- tation for this version of
TeX can be found in the info file or manual Web2C: A TeX
implementation.</p>

<p>The pktype program translates a packed font file (pk)
(output by, for example, gftopk(1) to a file that humans can
read. It also serves as a pk file-validating program (i.e.,
if pktype can read it, its correct) and as an example of a
pk-reading program for other software that wants to read pk
files.</p>

<p>The pk_file on the command line must be complete.
Because the resolu- tion is part of the extension, it would
not make sense to append a default extension as is done with
TeX or DVI-reading software. If no output_file is specified,
the plain text translation is written to standard
output.</p>

<p>The output file gives a compact encoding of the packed
encoding, using conventions described in the source code.
Run lengths of black pixels alternate with parenthesized run
lengths of white pixels, and brackets are used to indicate
when a row should be repeated.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT pktype looks for pk_file using the
environment variable PKFONTS. If that is not set, it uses
the variable TEXPKS. If that is not set, it uses TEXFONTS.
If that is not set, it uses the system default.</p>

<p>See tex(1) for the details of the searching.</p>

<p>AUTHORS Tomas Rokicki wrote the program. Donald E. Knuth
originally ported it to Unix. Pierre MacKay adapted it for
compilation with Web2c.</p>
