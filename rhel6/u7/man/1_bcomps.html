<p>NAME bcomps - biconnected components filter for
graphs</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS bcomps [ -stvx? ] [ -ooutfile ] [ files ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION bcomps decomposes graphs into their
biconnected components, printing the components to standard
output.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The following options are supported:</p>

<p>-s No output graph is printed. Implies the -v flag.</p>

<p>-t Print the underlying block-cutvertex tree.</p>

<p>-x Each biconnected component is printed as a separate
root graph.</p>

<p>-v Prints number of blocks and cutvertices.</p>

<p>-o outfile If specified, each root graph will be written
to a different file with the names derived from outfile. In
particular, if both -o and -x flags are used, then each
block is written to a dif- ferent file. If outfile does not
have a suffix, the nth block of the ith graph is written to
outfile_n_i. However, the 0th block of the 0th graph is
written to outfile.</p>

<p>If outfile has a suffix, i.e., has the form base.sfx,
then the files will have the same name as above, except
appended with .sfx.</p>

<p>The block-cutvertex tree of ith graph is written to
outfile_n_T, with an appended suffix if specified.</p>

<p>By default, each input graph is printed, with each block
given as a subgraph whose name is a concatenation of the
name of the input graph, the string &quot;_bcc_&quot; and
the number of the block.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operand is supported:</p>

<p>files Names of files containing 1 or more graphs in dot
format. If no files operand is specified, the standard input
will be used.</p>

<p>RETURN CODES bcomps returns 0 if all the input graphs
are biconnected; and non-zero if any graph has multiple
blocks, or any error occurred.</p>

<p>BUGS It is possible, though unlikely, that the names
used for connected com- ponents and their subgraphs may
conflict with existing subgraph names.</p>
