<p>NAME chkhelp - check performance metrics help text
files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS $PCP_BINADM_DIR/chkhelp [-eHiOp] [-n pmnsfile]
[-v version] helpfile [metricname ...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION chkhelp checks the consistency of
Performance Co-Pilot help text files generated by newhelp(1)
and used by Performance Metric Domain Agents (PMDAs). The
checking involves scanning the files, and optionally dis-
playing selected entries.</p>

<p>The files helpfile.dir and helpfile.pag are created by
newhelp(1), and are assumed to already exist.</p>

<p>Without any options or metricname arguments, chkhelp
silently verifies the structural integrity of the help
files.</p>

<p>If any metricname arguments are specified, then the help
entries for only the corresponding metrics will be
processed.</p>

<p>If no metricname arguments are specified, then at least
one of the options -i or -p must be given. The -i option
causes entries for all instance domains to be processed
(ignoring entries for performance met- rics). The -p option
causes entries for all metrics to be displayed (ignoring
entries for instance domains).</p>

<p>When metric entries are to be processed (via either the
metricname arguments or the -p option or the -i option), the
-O and -H options request the display of the one-line and
verbose help text respectively. The default is -O.</p>

<p>Although historically there have been multiple help text
file formats, the only format currently supported using the
-v option is version 2, and this is the default if no -v
flag is provided.</p>

<p>Normally chkhelp operates on the default Performance
Metrics Name Space (PMNS), however if the -n option is
specified an alternative namespace is loaded from the file
pmnsfile.</p>

<p>The -e option provides an existence check where all of
the specified metrics from the PMNS (note, not from
helpfile) are scanned, and only the names of the metrics for
which no help text exists are reported. The -e option is
mutually exclusive with the -i and/or -p options.</p>

<p>PCP ENVIRONMENT Environment variables with the prefix
PCP_ are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP. On each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in pcp.conf(5).</p>

<p>SEE ALSO newhelp(1), PMAPI(3), pmLookupInDomText(3),
pmLookupText(3), pcp.conf(5) and pcp.env(5).</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS There are all sorts of reasons a help
database may be inconsistent, the most likely is that a
performance metric in the database is not defined in the
loaded PMNS.</p>
