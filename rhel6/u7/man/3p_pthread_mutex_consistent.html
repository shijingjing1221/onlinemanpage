ManuPTHREAD_MUTEX_CONSISTENT(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME pthread_mutex_consistent mark state protected by
robust mutex as con- sistent</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;</p>

<p>int pthread_mutex_consistent(pthread_mutex_t
*mutex);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION If mutex is a robust mutex in an
inconsistent state, the pthread_mutex_consistent() function
can be used to mark the state pro- tected by the mutex
referenced by mutex as consistent again.</p>

<p>If an owner of a robust mutex terminates while holding
the mutex, the mutex becomes inconsistent and the next
thread that acquires the mutex lock shall be notified of the
state by the return value [EOWNERDEAD]. In this case, the
mutex does not become normally usable again until the state
is marked consistent.</p>

<p>If the thread which acquired the mutex lock with the
return value [EOWNERDEAD] terminates before calling either
pthread_mutex_consis- tent() or pthread_mutex_unlock(), the
next thread that acquires the mutex lock shall be notified
about the state of the mutex by the return value
[EOWNERDEAD].</p>

<p>The behavior is undefined if the value specified by the
mutex argument to pthread_mutex_consistent() does not refer
to an initialized mutex.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, the
pthread_mutex_consistent() function shall return zero.
Otherwise, an error value shall be returned to indi- cate
the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The pthread_mutex_consistent() function shall
fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The mutex object referenced by mutex is not
robust or does not protect an inconsistent state.</p>

<p>These functions shall not return an error code of
[EINTR].</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The pthread_mutex_consistent()
function is only responsible for notify- ing the
implementation that the state protected by the mutex has
been recovered and that normal operations with the mutex can
be resumed. It is the responsibility of the application to
recover the state so it can be reused. If the application is
not able to perform the recovery, it can notify the
implementation that the situation is unrecoverable by a call
to pthread_mutex_unlock() without a prior call to
pthread_mutex_consistent(), in which case subsequent threads
that attempt to lock the mutex will fail to acquire the lock
and be returned [ENOTRECOVERABLE].</p>

<p>RATIONALE If an implementation detects that the value
specified by the mutex argument to
pthread_mutex_consistent() does not refer to an initialized
mutex, it is recommended that the function should fail and
report an [EINVAL] error.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
