<p>ELF(5) Linux Programmer s Manual ELF(5)</p>

<p>NAME elf - format of Executable and Linking Format (ELF)
files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;elf.h&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The header file &lt;elf.h&gt; defines the
format of ELF executable binary files. Amongst these files
are normal executable files, relocatable object files, core
files and shared libraries.</p>

<p>An executable file using the ELF file format consists of
an ELF header, followed by a program header table or a
section header table, or both. The ELF header is always at
offset zero of the file. The program header table and the
section header tables offset in the file are defined in the
ELF header. The two tables describe the rest of the
particularities of the file.</p>

<p>This header file describes the above mentioned headers
as C structures and also includes structures for dynamic
sections, relocation sections and symbol tables.</p>

<p>The following types are used for N-bit architectures
(N=32,64, ElfN stands for Elf32 or Elf64, uintN_t stands for
uint32_t or uint64_t):</p>

<p>ElfN_Addr Unsigned program address, uintN_t ElfN_Off
Unsigned file offset, uintN_t ElfN_Section Unsigned section
index, uint16_t ElfN_Versym Unsigned version symbol
information, uint16_t Elf_Byte unsigned char ElfN_Half
uint16_t ElfN_Sword int32_t ElfN_Word uint32_t ElfN_Sxword
int64_t ElfN_Xword uint64_t</p>

<p>(Note: The *BSD terminology is a bit different. There
Elf64_Half is twice as large as Elf32_Half, and Elf64Quarter
is used for uint16_t. In order to avoid confusion these
types are replaced by explicit ones in the below.)</p>

<p>All data structures that the file format defines follow
the &quot;natural&quot; size and alignment guidelines for
the relevant class. If necessary, data structures contain
explicit padding to ensure 4-byte alignment for 4-byte
objects, to force structure sizes to a multiple of 4,
etc.</p>

<p>The ELF header is described by the type Elf32_Ehdr or
Elf64_Ehdr:</p>

<p>#define EI_NIDENT 16</p>

<p>typedef struct { unsigned char e_ident[EI_NIDENT];
uint16_t e_type; uint16_t e_machine; uint32_t e_version;
ElfN_Addr e_entry; ElfN_Off e_phoff; ElfN_Off e_shoff;
uint32_t e_flags; uint16_t e_ehsize; uint16_t e_phentsize;
uint16_t e_phnum; uint16_t e_shentsize; uint16_t e_shnum;
uint16_t e_shstrndx; } ElfN_Ehdr;</p>

<p>The fields have the following meanings:</p>

<p>e_ident This array of bytes specifies to interpret the
file, inde- pendent of the processor or the file s remaining
contents. Within this array everything is named by macros,
which start with the prefix EI_ and may contain values which
start with the prefix ELF. The following macros are
defined:</p>

<p>EI_MAG0 The first byte of the magic number. It must be
filled with ELFMAG0. (0: 0x7f)</p>

<p>EI_MAG1 The second byte of the magic number. It must be
filled with ELFMAG1. (1: &rsquo;E&rsquo;)</p>

<p>EI_MAG2 The third byte of the magic number. It must be
filled with ELFMAG2. (2: &rsquo;L&rsquo;)</p>

<p>EI_MAG3 The fourth byte of the magic number. It must be
filled with ELFMAG3. (3: &rsquo;F&rsquo;)</p>

<p>EI_CLASS The fifth byte identifies the architecture for
this binary:</p>

<p>ELFCLASSNONE This class is invalid. ELFCLASS32 This
defines the 32-bit architec- ture. It supports machines with
files and virtual address spaces up to 4 Gigabytes.
ELFCLASS64 This defines the 64-bit architec- ture.</p>

<p>EI_DATA The sixth byte specifies the data encoding of
the processor-specific data in the file. Cur- rently these
encodings are supported:</p>

<p>ELFDATANONE Unknown data format. ELFDATA2LSB Two s
complement, little-endian. ELFDATA2MSB Two s complement,
big-endian.</p>

<p>EI_VERSION The version number of the ELF specification:
EV_NONE Invalid version. EV_CURRENT Current version.</p>

<p>EI_OSABI This byte identifies the operating system and
ABI to which the object is targeted. Some fields in other
ELF structures have flags and values that have
platform-specific meanings; the interpretation of those
fields is deter- mined by the value of this byte. E.g.:</p>

<p>ELFOSABI_NONE Same as ELFOSABI_SYSV ELFOSABI_SYSV UNIX
System V ABI. ELFOSABI_HPUX HP-UX ABI. ELFOSABI_NETBSD
NetBSD ABI. ELFOSABI_LINUX Linux ABI. ELFOSABI_SOLARIS
Solaris ABI. ELFOSABI_IRIX IRIX ABI. ELFOSABI_FREEBSD
FreeBSD ABI. ELFOSABI_TRU64 TRU64 UNIX ABI. ELFOSABI_ARM ARM
architecture ABI. ELFOSABI_STANDALONE Stand-alone (embedded)
ABI.</p>

<p>EI_ABIVERSION This byte identifies the version of the
ABI to which the object is targeted. This field is used to
distinguish among incompatible versions of an ABI. The
interpretation of this version number is dependent on the
ABI identified by the EI_OSABI field. Applications
conforming to this specification use the value 0.</p>

<p>EI_PAD Start of padding. These bytes are reserved and
set to zero. Programs which read them should ignore them.
The value for EI_PAD will change in the future if currently
unused bytes are given meanings.</p>

<p>EI_BRAND Start of architecture identification.</p>

<p>EI_NIDENT The size of the e_ident array.</p>

<p>e_type This member of the structure identifies the
object file type:</p>

<p>ET_NONE An unknown type. ET_REL A relocatable file.
ET_EXEC An executable file. ET_DYN A shared object. ET_CORE
A core file.</p>

<p>e_machine This member specifies the required
architecture for an individual file. E.g.:</p>

<p>EM_NONE An unknown machine. EM_M32 AT&amp;T WE 32100.
EM_SPARC Sun Microsystems SPARC. EM_386 Intel 80386. EM_68K
Motorola 68000. EM_88K Motorola 88000. EM_860 Intel 80860.
EM_MIPS MIPS RS3000 (big-endian only). EM_PARISC HP/PA.
EM_SPARC32PLUS SPARC with enhanced instruction set. EM_PPC
PowerPC. EM_PPC64 PowerPC 64-bit. EM_S390 IBM S/390 EM_ARM
Advanced RISC Machines EM_SH Renesas SuperH EM_SPARCV9 SPARC
v9 64-bit. EM_IA_64 Intel Itanium EM_X86_64 AMD x86-64
EM_VAX DEC Vax.</p>

<p>e_version This member identifies the file version:</p>

<p>EV_NONE Invalid version. EV_CURRENT Current version.</p>

<p>e_entry This member gives the virtual address to which
the system first transfers control, thus starting the
process. If the file has no associated entry point, this
member holds zero.</p>

<p>e_phoff This member holds the program header tables file
offset in bytes. If the file has no program header table,
this mem- ber holds zero.</p>

<p>e_shoff This member holds the section header tables file
offset in bytes. If the file has no section header table
this member holds zero.</p>

<p>e_flags This member holds processor-specific flags
associated with the file. Flag names take the form EF_
machine_flag. Currently no flags have been defined.</p>

<p>e_ehsize This member holds the ELF headers size in
bytes.</p>

<p>e_phentsize This member holds the size in bytes of one
entry in the file s program header table; all entries are
the same size.</p>

<p>e_phnum This member holds the number of entries in the
program header table. Thus the product of e_phentsize and
e_phnum gives the tables size in bytes. If a file has no
program header, e_phnum holds the value zero.</p>

<p>e_shentsize This member holds a sections headers size in
bytes. A section header is one entry in the section header
table; all entries are the same size.</p>

<p>e_shnum This member holds the number of entries in the
section header table. Thus the product of e_shentsize and
e_shnum gives the section header tables size in bytes. If a
file has no section header table, e_shnum holds the value of
zero.</p>

<p>e_shstrndx This member holds the section header table
index of the entry associated with the section name string
table. If the file has no section name string table, this
member holds the value SHN_UNDEF.</p>

<p>SHN_UNDEF This value marks an undefined, missing,
irrelevant, or otherwise meaningless section reference. For
example, a symbol &quot;defined&quot; relative to section
number SHN_UNDEF is an undefined symbol.</p>

<p>SHN_LORESERVE This value specifies the lower bound of
the range of reserved indices.</p>

<p>SHN_LOPROC Values greater than or equal to SHN_HIPROC
are reserved for processor-specific seman- tics.</p>

<p>SHN_HIPROC Values less than or equal to SHN_LOPROC are
reserved for processor-specific semantics.</p>

<p>SHN_ABS This value specifies absolute values for the
corresponding reference. For example, sym- bols defined
relative to section number SHN_ABS have absolute values and
are not affected by relocation.</p>

<p>SHN_COMMON Symbols defined relative to this section are
common symbols, such as Fortran COMMON or unallocated C
external variables.</p>

<p>SHN_HIRESERVE This value specifies the upper bound of
the range of reserved indices between SHN_LORE- SERVE and
SHN_HIRESERVE, inclusive; the val- ues do not reference the
section header ta- ble. That is, the section header table
does not contain entries for the reserved indices.</p>

<p>An executable or shared object files program header
table is an array of structures, each describing a segment
or other information the sys- tem needs to prepare the
program for execution. An object file segment contains one
or more sections. Program headers are meaningful only for
executable and shared object files. A file specifies its own
program header size with the ELF headers e_phentsize and
e_phnum members. The ELF program header is described by the
type Elf32_Phdr or Elf64_Phdr depending on the
architecture:</p>

<p>typedef struct { uint32_t p_type; Elf32_Off p_offset;
Elf32_Addr p_vaddr; Elf32_Addr p_paddr; uint32_t p_filesz;
uint32_t p_memsz; uint32_t p_flags; uint32_t p_align; }
Elf32_Phdr;</p>

<p>typedef struct { uint32_t p_type; uint32_t p_flags;
Elf64_Off p_offset; Elf64_Addr p_vaddr; Elf64_Addr p_paddr;
uint64_t p_filesz; uint64_t p_memsz; uint64_t p_align; }
Elf64_Phdr;</p>

<p>The main difference between the 32-bit and the 64-bit
program header lies in the location of the p_flags member in
the total struct.</p>

<p>p_type This member of the Phdr struct tells what kind of
segment this array element describes or how to interpret the
array elements information.</p>

<p>PT_NULL The array element is unused and the other mem-
bers values are undefined. This lets the pro- gram header
have ignored entries.</p>

<p>PT_LOAD The array element specifies a loadable segment,
described by p_filesz and p_memsz. The bytes from the file
are mapped to the beginning of the memory segment. If the
segments memory size p_memsz is larger than the file size
p_filesz, the &quot;extra&quot; bytes are defined to hold
the value 0 and to follow the segments ini- tialized area.
The file size may not be larger than the memory size.
Loadable segment entries in the program header table appear
in ascending order, sorted on the p_vaddr member.</p>

<p>PT_DYNAMIC The array element specifies dynamic linking
information.</p>

<p>PT_INTERP The array element specifies the location and
size of a null-terminated pathname to invoke as an
interpreter. This segment type is meaning- ful only for
executable files (though it may occur for shared objects).
However it may not occur more than once in a file. If it is
present, it must precede any loadable segment entry.</p>

<p>PT_NOTE The array element specifies the location and
size for auxiliary information.</p>

<p>PT_SHLIB This segment type is reserved but has unspeci-
fied semantics. Programs that contain an array element of
this type do not conform to the ABI.</p>

<p>PT_PHDR The array element, if present, specifies the
location and size of the program header table itself, both
in the file and in the memory image of the program. This
segment type may not occur more than once in a file.
Moreover, it may only occur if the program header table is
part of the memory image of the program. If it is present,
it must precede any loadable segment entry.</p>

<p>PT_LOPROC Values greater than or equal to PT_HIPROC are
reserved for processor-specific semantics.</p>

<p>PT_HIPROC Values less than or equal to PT_LOPROC are
reserved for processor-specific semantics. PT_GNU_STACK GNU
extension which is used by the Linux kernel to control the
state of the stack via the flags set in the p_flags
member.</p>

<p>p_offset This member holds the offset from the beginning
of the file at which the first byte of the segment
resides.</p>

<p>p_vaddr This member holds the virtual address at which
the first byte of the segment resides in memory.</p>

<p>p_paddr On systems for which physical addressing is
relevant, this member is reserved for the segment s physical
address. Under BSD this member is not used and must be
zero.</p>

<p>p_filesz This member holds the number of bytes in the
file image of the segment. It may be zero.</p>

<p>p_memsz This member holds the number of bytes in the
memory image of the segment. It may be zero.</p>

<p>p_flags This member holds a bitmask of flags relevant to
the seg- ment:</p>

<p>PF_X An executable segment. PF_W A writable segment.
PF_R A readable segment.</p>

<p>A text segment commonly has the flags PF_X and PF_R. A
data segment commonly has PF_X, PF_W and PF_R.</p>

<p>p_align This member holds the value to which the
segments are aligned in memory and in the file. Loadable
process seg- ments must have congruent values for p_vaddr
and p_offset, modulo the page size. Values of zero and one
mean no alignment is required. Otherwise, p_align should be
a pos- itive, integral power of two, and p_vaddr should
equal p_offset, modulo p_align.</p>

<p>A files section header table lets one locate all the
files sections. The section header table is an array of
Elf32_Shdr or Elf64_Shdr struc- tures. The ELF header s
e_shoff member gives the byte offset from the beginning of
the file to the section header table. e_shnum holds the
number of entries the section header table contains.
e_shentsize holds the size in bytes of each entry.</p>

<p>A section header table index is a subscript into this
array. Some sec- tion header table indices are reserved. An
object file does not have sections for these special
indices:</p>

<p>SHN_UNDEF This value marks an undefined, missing,
irrelevant or otherwise meaningless section reference.</p>

<p>SHN_LORESERVE This value specifies the lower bound of
the range of reserved indices.</p>

<p>SHN_LOPROC Values greater than or equal to SHN_HIPROC
are reserved for processor-specific semantics.</p>

<p>SHN_HIPROC Values less than or equal to SHN_LOPROC are
reserved for processor-specific semantics.</p>

<p>SHN_ABS This value specifies the absolute value for the
corre- sponding reference. For example, a symbol defined
rela- tive to section number SHN_ABS has an absolute value
and is not affected by relocation.</p>

<p>SHN_COMMON Symbols defined relative to this section are
common sym- bols, such as FORTRAN COMMON or unallocated C
external variables.</p>

<p>SHN_HIRESERVE This value specifies the upper bound of
the range of reserved indices. The system reserves indices
between SHN_LORESERVE and SHN_HIRESERVE, inclusive. The
section header table does not contain entries for the
reserved indices.</p>

<p>The section header has the following structure:</p>

<p>typedef struct { uint32_t sh_name; uint32_t sh_type;
uint32_t sh_flags; Elf32_Addr sh_addr; Elf32_Off sh_offset;
uint32_t sh_size; uint32_t sh_link; uint32_t sh_info;
uint32_t sh_addralign; uint32_t sh_entsize; }
Elf32_Shdr;</p>

<p>typedef struct { uint32_t sh_name; uint32_t sh_type;
uint64_t sh_flags; Elf64_Addr sh_addr; Elf64_Off sh_offset;
uint64_t sh_size; uint32_t sh_link; uint32_t sh_info;
uint64_t sh_addralign; uint64_t sh_entsize; }
Elf64_Shdr;</p>

<p>No real differences exist between the 32-bit and 64-bit
section head- ers.</p>

<p>sh_name This member specifies the name of the section.
Its value is an index into the section header string table
section, giving the location of a null-terminated
string.</p>

<p>sh_type This member categorizes the section s contents
and semantics.</p>

<p>SHT_NULL This value marks the section header as inac-
tive. It does not have an associated section. Other members
of the section header have unde- fined values.</p>

<p>SHT_PROGBITS This section holds information defined by
the program, whose format and meaning are deter- mined
solely by the program.</p>

<p>SHT_SYMTAB This section holds a symbol table. Typically,
SHT_SYMTAB provides symbols for link editing, though it may
also be used for dynamic link- ing. As a complete symbol
table, it may con- tain many symbols unnecessary for dynamic
linking. An object file can also contain a SHT_DYNSYM
section.</p>

<p>SHT_STRTAB This section holds a string table. An object
file may have multiple string table sections.</p>

<p>SHT_RELA This section holds relocation entries with
explicit addends, such as type Elf32_Rela for the 32-bit
class of object files. An object may have multiple
relocation sections.</p>

<p>SHT_HASH This section holds a symbol hash table. An
object participating in dynamic linking must contain a
symbol hash table. An object file may have only one hash
table.</p>

<p>SHT_DYNAMIC This section holds information for dynamic
linking. An object file may have only one dynamic
section.</p>

<p>SHT_NOTE This section holds information that marks the
file in some way.</p>

<p>SHT_NOBITS A section of this type occupies no space in
the file but otherwise resembles SHT_PROGBITS. Although this
section contains no bytes, the sh_offset member contains the
conceptual file offset.</p>

<p>SHT_REL This section holds relocation offsets without
explicit addends, such as type Elf32_Rel for the 32-bit
class of object files. An object file may have multiple
relocation sections.</p>

<p>SHT_SHLIB This section is reserved but has unspecified
semantics.</p>

<p>SHT_DYNSYM This section holds a minimal set of dynamic
linking symbols. An object file can also con- tain a
SHT_SYMTAB section.</p>

<p>SHT_LOPROC This value up to and including SHT_HIPROC is
reserved for processor-specific semantics.</p>

<p>SHT_HIPROC This value down to and including SHT_LOPROC
is reserved for processor-specific semantics.</p>

<p>SHT_LOUSER This value specifies the lower bound of the
range of indices reserved for application pro- grams.</p>

<p>SHT_HIUSER This value specifies the upper bound of the
range of indices reserved for application pro- grams.
Section types between SHT_LOUSER and SHT_HIUSER may be used
by the application, without conflicting with current or
future system-defined section types.</p>

<p>sh_flags Sections support one-bit flags that describe
miscellaneous attributes. If a flag bit is set in sh_flags,
the attribute is &quot;on&quot; for the section. Otherwise,
the attribute is &quot;off&quot; or does not apply.
Undefined attributes are set to zero.</p>

<p>SHF_WRITE This section contains data that should be
writable during process execution.</p>

<p>SHF_ALLOC This section occupies memory during process
execution. Some control sections do not reside in the memory
image of an object file. This attribute is off for those
sections.</p>

<p>SHF_EXECINSTR This section contains executable machine
instructions.</p>

<p>SHF_MASKPROC All bits included in this mask are reserved
for processor-specific semantics.</p>

<p>sh_addr If this section appears in the memory image of a
process, this member holds the address at which the sections
first byte should reside. Otherwise, the member contains
zero.</p>

<p>sh_offset This members value holds the byte offset from
the beginning of the file to the first byte in the section.
One section type, SHT_NOBITS, occupies no space in the file,
and its sh_offset member locates the conceptual placement in
the file.</p>

<p>sh_size This member holds the sections size in bytes.
Unless the section type is SHT_NOBITS, the section occupies
sh_size bytes in the file. A section of type SHT_NOBITS may
have a non-zero size, but it occupies no space in the
file.</p>

<p>sh_link This member holds a section header table index
link, whose interpretation depends on the section type.</p>

<p>sh_info This member holds extra information, whose
interpretation depends on the section type.</p>

<p>sh_addralign Some sections have address alignment
constraints. If a sec- tion holds a doubleword, the system
must ensure doubleword alignment for the entire section.
That is, the value of sh_addr must be congruent to zero,
modulo the value of sh_addralign. Only zero and positive
integral powers of two are allowed. Values of zero or one
mean the section has no alignment constraints.</p>

<p>sh_entsize Some sections hold a table of fixed-sized
entries, such as a symbol table. For such a section, this
member gives the size in bytes for each entry. This member
contains zero if the section does not hold a table of
fixed-size entries.</p>

<p>Various sections hold program and control
information:</p>

<p>.bss This section holds uninitialized data that
contributes to the program s memory image. By definition,
the system initial- izes the data with zeros when the
program begins to run. This section is of type SHT_NOBITS.
The attribute types are SHF_ALLOC and SHF_WRITE.</p>

<p>.comment This section holds version control information.
This section is of type SHT_PROGBITS. No attribute types are
used.</p>

type SHT_PROG- BITS. No attribute types are used.</p>

<p>.dtors This section holds initialized pointers to the
C++ destructor functions. This section is of type
SHT_PROGBITS. The attribute types are SHF_ALLOC and
SHF_WRITE.</p>

<p>.dynamic This section holds dynamic linking information.

Whether the SHF_WRITE bit is set is processor-specific. This
section is of type SHT_DYNAMIC. See the attributes
above.</p>

<p>.dynstr This section holds strings needed for dynamic
linking, most commonly the strings that represent the names
associated with symbol table entries. This section is of
type SHT_STRTAB. The attribute type used is SHF_ALLOC.</p>

<p>.dynsym This section holds the dynamic linking symbol
table. This section is of type SHT_DYNSYM. The attribute
used is SHF_ALLOC.</p>

<p>.fini This section holds executable instructions that
contribute to the process termination code. When a program
exits normally the system arranges to execute the code in
this section. This section is of type SHT_PROGBITS. The
attributes used are SHF_ALLOC and SHF_EXECINSTR.</p>

<p>.gnu.version This section holds the version symbol
table, an array of ElfN_Half elements. This section is of
type SHT_GNU_versym. The attribute type used is
SHF_ALLOC.</p>

<p>.gnu.version_d This section holds the version symbol
definitions, a table of ElfN_Verdef structures. This section
is of type SHT_GNU_verdef. The attribute type used is
SHF_ALLOC.</p>

<p>.gnu.version_r This section holds the version symbol
needed elements, a ta- ble of ElfN_Verneed structures. This
section is of type SHT_GNU_versym. The attribute type used
is SHF_ALLOC.</p>

<p>.got This section holds the global offset table. This
section is of type SHT_PROGBITS. The attributes are
processor specific.</p>

<p>.hash This section holds a symbol hash table. This
section is of type SHT_HASH. The attribute used is
SHF_ALLOC.</p>

<p>.init This section holds executable instructions that
contribute to the process initialization code. When a
program starts to run the system arranges to execute the
code in this section before calling the main program entry
point. This section is of type SHT_PROGBITS. The attributes
used are SHF_ALLOC and SHF_EXECINSTR.</p>

<p>.interp This section holds the pathname of a program
interpreter. If the file has a loadable segment that
includes the section, the sections attributes will include
the SHF_ALLOC bit. Otherwise, that bit will be off. This
section is of type SHT_PROGBITS.</p>

<p>.line This section holds line number information for
symbolic debugging, which describes the correspondence
between the program source and the machine code. The
contents are unspecified. This section is of type
SHT_PROGBITS. No attribute types are used.</p>

<p>.note This section holds information in the &quot;Note
Section&quot; format described below. This section is of
type SHT_NOTE. No attribute types are used. OpenBSD native
executables usually contain a .note.openbsd.ident section to
identify themselves, for the kernel to bypass any
compatibility ELF binary emula- tion tests when loading the
file.</p>

<p>.note.GNU-stack This section is used in Linux object
files for declaring stack attributes. This section is of
type SHT_PROGBITS. The only attribute used is SHF_EXECINSTR.
This indicates to the GNU linker that the object file
requires an executable stack.</p>

<p>.plt This section holds the procedure linkage table.
This section is of type SHT_PROGBITS. The attributes are
processor spe- cific.</p>

<p>.relNAME This section holds relocation information as
described below. If the file has a loadable segment that
includes relocation, the section s attributes will include
the SHF_ALLOC bit. Otherwise the bit will be off. By
convention, &quot;NAME&quot; is sup- plied by the section to
which the relocations apply. Thus a relocation section for
.text normally would have the name .rel.text. This section
is of type SHT_REL.</p>

<p>.relaNAME This section holds relocation information as
described below. If the file has a loadable segment that
includes relocation, the section s attributes will include
the SHF_ALLOC bit. Otherwise the bit will be off. By
convention, &quot;NAME&quot; is sup- plied by the section to
which the relocations apply. Thus a relocation section for
.text normally would have the name .rela.text. This section
is of type SHT_RELA.</p>

<p>.rodata This section holds read-only data that typically
contributes to a non-writable segment in the process image.
This section is of type SHT_PROGBITS. The attribute used is
SHF_ALLOC.</p>

<p>.rodata1 This section holds read-only data that
typically contributes to a non-writable segment in the
process image. This section is of type SHT_PROGBITS. The
attribute used is SHF_ALLOC.</p>

<p>.shstrtab This section holds section names. This section
is of type SHT_STRTAB. No attribute types are used.</p>

<p>.strtab This section holds strings, most commonly the
strings that represent the names associated with symbol
table entries. If the file has a loadable segment that
includes the symbol string table, the sections attributes
will include the SHF_ALLOC bit. Otherwise the bit will be
off. This section is of type SHT_STRTAB.</p>

<p>.symtab This section holds a symbol table. If the file
has a load- able segment that includes the symbol table, the
sections attributes will include the SHF_ALLOC bit.
Otherwise the bit will be off. This section is of type
SHT_SYMTAB.</p>

<p>.text This section holds the &quot;text&quot;, or
executable instructions, of a program. This section is of
type SHT_PROGBITS. The attributes used are SHF_ALLOC and
SHF_EXECINSTR.</p>

<p>String table sections hold null-terminated character
sequences, com- monly called strings. The object file uses
these strings to represent symbol and section names. One
references a string as an index into the string table
section. The first byte, which is index zero, is defined to
hold a null byte (&rsquo; &rsquo;). Similarly, a string
table s last byte is defined to hold a null byte, ensuring
null termination for all strings.</p>

<p>An object files symbol table holds information needed to
locate and relocate a programs symbolic definitions and
references. A symbol ta- ble index is a subscript into this
array.</p>

<p>typedef struct { uint32_t st_name; Elf32_Addr st_value;
uint32_t st_size; unsigned char st_info; unsigned char
st_other; uint16_t st_shndx; } Elf32_Sym;</p>

<p>typedef struct { uint32_t st_name; unsigned char
st_info; unsigned char st_other; uint16_t st_shndx;
Elf64_Addr st_value; uint64_t st_size; } Elf64_Sym;</p>

<p>The 32-bit and 64-bit versions have the same members,
just in a differ- ent order.</p>

<p>st_name This member holds an index into the object files
symbol string table, which holds character representations
of the symbol names. If the value is non-zero, it represents
a string table index that gives the symbol name. Otherwise,
the symbol table has no name.</p>

<p>st_value This member gives the value of the associated
symbol.</p>

<p>st_size Many symbols have associated sizes. This member
holds zero if the symbol has no size or an unknown size.</p>

<p>st_info This member specifies the symbols type and
binding attributes:</p>

<p>STT_NOTYPE The symbols type is not defined.</p>

<p>STT_OBJECT The symbol is associated with a data
object.</p>

<p>STT_FUNC The symbol is associated with a function or
other executable code.</p>

<p>STT_SECTION The symbol is associated with a section.
Symbol table entries of this type exist primarily for
relocation and normally have STB_LOCAL bindings.</p>

<p>STT_FILE By convention, the symbol s name gives the name
of the source file associated with the object file. A file
symbol has STB_LOCAL bindings, its section index is SHN_ABS,
and it precedes the other STB_LOCAL symbols of the file, if
it is present.</p>

<p>STT_LOPROC This value up to and including STT_HIPROC is
reserved for processor-specific semantics.</p>

<p>STT_HIPROC This value down to and including STT_LOPROC
is reserved for processor-specific semantics.</p>

<p>STB_LOCAL Local symbols are not visible outside the
object file containing their definition. Local symbols of
the same name may exist in multiple files without
interfering with each other.</p>

<p>STB_GLOBAL Global symbols are visible to all object
files being combined. One file s definition of a global
symbol will satisfy another files unde- fined reference to
the same symbol.</p>

<p>STB_WEAK Weak symbols resemble global symbols, but their
definitions have lower precedence.</p>

<p>STB_LOPROC This value up to and including STB_HIPROC is
reserved for processor-specific semantics.</p>

<p>STB_HIPROC This value down to and including STB_LOPROC
is reserved for processor-specific semantics.</p>

<p>There are macros for packing and unpacking the binding
and type fields:</p>

<p>ELF32_ST_BIND(info) or ELF64_ST_BIND(info) extract a
binding from an st_info value.</p>

<p>ELF32_ST_TYPE(info) or ELF64_ST_TYPE(info) extract a
type from an st_info value.</p>

<p>ELF32_ST_INFO(bind, type) or ELF64_ST_INFO(bind, type)
convert a binding and a type into an st_info value.</p>

<p>st_other This member defines the symbol visibility.</p>

<p>STV_DEFAULT Default symbol visibility rules.
STV_INTERNAL Processor-specific hidden class. STV_HIDDEN
Symbol is unavailable in other modules. STV_PROTECTED Not
preemptible, not exported.</p>

<p>There are macros for extracting the visibility type:</p>

<p>ELF32_ST_VISIBILITY(other) or
ELF64_ST_VISIBILITY(other)</p>

<p>st_shndx Every symbol table entry is &quot;defined&quot;
in relation to some section. This member holds the relevant
section header table index.</p>

<p>Relocation is the process of connecting symbolic
references with sym- bolic definitions. Relocatable files
must have information that describes how to modify their
section contents, thus allowing exe- cutable and shared
object files to hold the right information for a process s
program image. Relocation entries are these data.</p>

<p>Relocation structures that do not need an addend:</p>

<p>typedef struct { Elf32_Addr r_offset; uint32_t r_info; }
Elf32_Rel;</p>

<p>typedef struct { Elf64_Addr r_offset; uint64_t r_info; }
Elf64_Rel;</p>

<p>Relocation structures that need an addend:</p>

<p>typedef struct { Elf32_Addr r_offset; uint32_t r_info;
int32_t r_addend; } Elf32_Rela;</p>

<p>typedef struct { Elf64_Addr r_offset; uint64_t r_info;
int64_t r_addend; } Elf64_Rela;</p>

<p>r_offset This member gives the location at which to
apply the relo- cation action. For a relocatable file, the
value is the byte offset from the beginning of the section
to the stor- age unit affected by the relocation. For an
executable file or shared object, the value is the virtual
address of the storage unit affected by the relocation.</p>

<p>r_info This member gives both the symbol table index
with respect to which the relocation must be made and the
type of relocation to apply. Relocation types are processor
spe- cific. When the text refers to a relocation entrys
relo- cation type or symbol table index, it means the result
of applying ELF_[32|64]_R_TYPE or ELF[32|64]_R_SYM, respec-
tively, to the entrys r_info member.</p>

<p>r_addend This member specifies a constant addend used to
compute the value to be stored into the relocatable
field.</p>

<p>The .dynamic section contains a series of structures
that hold relevant dynamic linking information. The d_tag
member controls the interpreta- tion of d_un.</p>

<p>typedef struct { Elf32_Sword d_tag; union { Elf32_Word
d_val; Elf32_Addr d_ptr; } d_un; } Elf32_Dyn; extern
Elf32_Dyn _DYNAMIC[];</p>

<p>typedef struct { Elf64_Sxword d_tag; union { Elf64_Xword
d_val; Elf64_Addr d_ptr; } d_un; } Elf64_Dyn; extern
Elf64_Dyn _DYNAMIC[];</p>

<p>d_tag This member may have any of the following
values:</p>

<p>DT_NULL Marks end of dynamic section</p>

<p>DT_NEEDED String table offset to name of a needed
library</p>

<p>DT_PLTRELSZ Size in bytes of PLT relocs</p>

before the executable for symbols</p>

<p>DT_REL Address of Rel relocs table</p>

<p>DT_RELSZ Size in bytes of Rel table</p>

<p>DT_RELENT Size in bytes of a Rel table entry</p>

<p>DT_PLTREL Type of reloc the PLT refers (Rela or Rel)</p>

<p>DT_DEBUG Undefined use for debugging</p>

<p>DT_TEXTREL Absence of this indicates no relocs should
apply to a non-writable segment</p>

<p>DT_JMPREL Address of reloc entries solely for the
PLT</p>

<p>DT_BIND_NOW Instruct dynamic linker to process all
relocs before transferring control to the executable</p>

<p>DT_RUNPATH String table offset to library search
path</p>

<p>DT_LOPROC Start of processor-specific semantics</p>

<p>DT_HIPROC End of processor-specific semantics</p>

<p>d_val This member represents integer values with various
interpre- tations.</p>

<p>d_ptr This member represents program virtual addresses.
When interpreting these addresses, the actual address should
be computed based on the original file value and memory base
address. Files do not contain relocation entries to fixup
these addresses.</p>

<p>_DYNAMIC Array containing all the dynamic structures in
the .dynamic section. This is automatically populated by the
linker.</p>
