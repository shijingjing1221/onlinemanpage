<p>TPM Management - tpm_setactive</p>

<p>NAME tpm_setactive - change TPM active states</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS tpm_setactive [OPTION]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION tpm_setactive reports the status of the TPM
s flags regarding the active state of the TPM. This is the
default behavior and also accessible via the --status
option. Requesting a report of this status prompts for the
owner password. The --active option changes the TPM to the
active state (via the TPM_PhysicalSetDeactivated API). This
operation requires evidence of physical presence, is
persistent and requires a reboot to take affect. The
--inactive option (via the TPM_PhysicalSetDeactivated API)
changes the TPM to the inactive state. This operation
requires evidence of physical presence, is persistent and
requires a reboot to take affect. An inactive TPM is
essentially off but still allows for a tpm_takeownership to
occur. The --temp option causes deactivation (via the
TPM_SetTempDeactivated API) to happen immediately but only
endure for the current boot cycle. The --status, --active,
--inactive, and --temp options are mutually exclusive and
the last one on the command line will be carried out.</p>

<p>-h, --help Display command usage info.</p>

<p>-v, --version Display command version info.</p>

<p>-l, --log [none|error|info|debug] Set logging level.</p>

<p>-u, --unicode Use TSS UNICODE encoding for passwords to
comply with applications using TSS popup boxes</p>

<p>-s, --status Report the status of flags regarding the
TPM active states.</p>

<p>-a, --active Make the TPM active. Operation is
persistent, requires phyiscal presence to authorize, and a
reboot to take affect.</p>

<p>-i, --inactive Make the TPM inactive. Operation is
persistent, requires phyiscal presence to authorize, and a
reboot to take affect.</p>

<p>-t, --temp Makes the TPM inactive for the current boot
cycle only.</p>

<p>-z, --well-known Authenticate using 20 bytes of zeros as
owner password (the default TSS Well Known Secret), instead
of prompting for an owner password.</p>
