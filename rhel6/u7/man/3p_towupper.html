<p>TOWUPPER(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual TOWUPPER(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME towupper - transliterate lowercase wide-character
code to uppercase</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;wctype.h&gt;</p>

<p>wint_t towupper(wint_t wc);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The towupper() function has as a domain a
type wint_t, the value of which the application shall ensure
is a character representable as a wchar_t, and a
wide-character code corresponding to a valid character in
the current locale or the value of WEOF. If the argument has
any other value, the behavior is undefined. If the argument
of towupper() represents a lowercase wide-character code,
and there exists a corre- sponding uppercase wide-character
code (as defined by character type information in the
program locale category LC_CTYPE ), the result shall be the
corresponding uppercase wide-character code. All other argu-
ments in the domain are returned unchanged.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, towupper()
shall return the uppercase let- ter corresponding to the
argument passed. Otherwise, it shall return the argument
unchanged.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>
