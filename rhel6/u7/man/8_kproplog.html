<p>NAME kproplog - display the contents of the Kerberos
principal update log</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS kproplog [-h] [-e num]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The kproplog command displays the contents
of the Kerberos principal update log to standard output. It
can be used to keep track of the incremental updates to the
principal database, when enabled. The update log file
contains the update log maintained by the kadmind pro- cess
on the master KDC server and the kpropd process on the slave
KDC servers. When updates occur, they are logged to this
file. Subse- quently any KDC slave configured for
incremental updates will request the current data from the
master KDC and update their principal.ulog file with any
updates returned.</p>

<p>The kproplog command can only be run on a KDC server by
someone with privileges comparable to the superuser. It will
display update entries for that server only.</p>

<p>If no options are specified, the summary of the update
log is dis- played. If invoked on the master, all of the
update entries are also displayed. When invoked on a slave
KDC server, only a summary of the updates are displayed,
which includes the serial number of the last update received
and the associated time stamp of the last update.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -h Display a summary of the update log. This
information includes the database version number, state of
the database, the number of updates in the log, the time
stamp of the first and last update, and the version number
of the first and last update entry.</p>

<p>-e num Display the last num update entries in the log.
This is useful when debugging synchronization between KDC
servers.</p>

<p>-v Display individual attributes per update. An example
of the output generated for one entry: Update Entry Update
serial # : 4 Update operation : Add Update principal :
