<p>KILLPG(2) Linux Programmer s Manual KILLPG(2)</p>

<p>NAME killpg - send signal to a process group</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;signal.h&gt;</p>

<p>int killpg(int pgrp, int sig);</p>

<p>Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
feature_test_macros(7)):</p>

<p>killpg(): _BSD_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;= 500</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION killpg() sends the signal sig to the process
group pgrp. See signal(7) for a list of signals.</p>

<p>If pgrp is 0, killpg() sends the signal to the calling
processs pro- cess group. (POSIX says: If pgrp is less than
or equal to 1, the behavior is undefined.)</p>

<p>For a process to have permission to send a signal it
must either be privileged (under Linux: have the CAP_KILL
capability), or the real or effective user ID of the sending
process must equal the real or saved set-user-ID of the
target process. In the case of SIGCONT it suffices when the
sending and receiving processes belong to the same
session.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, zero is returned. On error, -1
is returned, and errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS EINVAL Sig is not a valid signal number.</p>

<p>EPERM The process does not have permission to send the
signal to any of the target processes.</p>

<p>ESRCH No process can be found in the process group
specified by pgrp.</p>

<p>ESRCH The process group was given as 0 but the sending
process does not have a process group.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO SVr4, 4.4BSD (the killpg() function call
first appeared in 4BSD), POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>NOTES There are various differences between the
permission checking in BSD- type systems and System V-type
systems. See the POSIX rationale for kill(). A difference
not mentioned by POSIX concerns the return value EPERM: BSD
documents that no signal is sent and EPERM returned when the
permission check failed for at least one target process,
while POSIX documents EPERM only when the permission check
failed for all target processes.</p>

<p>On Linux, killpg() is implemented as a library function
that makes the call kill(-pgrp, sig).</p>
