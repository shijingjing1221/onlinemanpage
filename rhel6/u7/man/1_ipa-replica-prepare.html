<p>NAME ipa-replica-prepare - Create an IPA replica
file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ipa-replica-prepare [OPTION]... hostname</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Generates a replica file that may be used
with ipa-replica-install to create a replica of an IPA
server.</p>

<p>A replica can only be created on an IPA server installed
with ipa-server-install (the first server).</p>

<p>You must provide the fully-qualified hostname of the
machine you want to install the replica on and a
host-specific replica_file will be cre- ated. It is
host-specific because SSL server certificates are generated
as part of the process and they are specific to a particular
hostname.</p>

<p>If IPA manages the DNS for your domain, you should
either use the --ip-address option or add the forward and
reverse records manually using IPA plugins.</p>

<p>Once the file has been created it will be named
replica-hostname. This file can then be moved across the
network to the target machine and a new IPA replica setup by
running ipa-replica-install replica-hostname.</p>

<p>A replica should only be installed on the same or higher
version of IPA on the remote system.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --dirsrv_pkcs12=FILE PKCS#12 file containing the
Directory Server SSL Certificate and Private Key</p>

<p>--http_pkcs12=FILE PKCS#12 file containing the Apache
Server SSL Certificate and Private Key</p>

<p>--dirsrv_pin=DIRSRV_PIN The password of the Directory
Server PKCS#12 file</p>

<p>--http_pin=HTTP_PIN The password of the Apache Server
PKCS#12 file</p>

<p>-p DM_PASSWORD, --password=DM_PASSWORD Directory Manager
(existing master) password</p>

<p>--ip-address=IP_ADDRESS IP address of the replica
server. If you provide this option, the A and PTR records
will be added to the DNS.</p>

<p>--reverse-zone=REVERSE_ZONE The reverse DNS zone to
use</p>

<p>--no-reverse Do not create reverse DNS zone</p>

<p>--ca=CA_FILE Location of CA PKCS#12 file, default
/root/cacert.p12</p>

<p>--debug Prints info log messages to the output</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS 0 if the command was successful</p>

<p>1 if an error occurred</p>
