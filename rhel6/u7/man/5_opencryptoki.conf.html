OPENCRYPTOKI.CONF(5)</p>

<p>NAME opencryptoki.conf - Configuration file for
pkcsslotd.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pkcsslotd uses a configuration file at
&quot;/etc&quot;/opencryptoki/opencryp- toki.conf</p>

<p>This is a text file that contains information used to
configure pkcs#11 slots. At startup, the pkcsslotd daemon
parses this file to determine which slots will be made
available.</p>

<p>SYNTAX This file is made up of slot descriptions. Each
slot description is composed of a slot number, brackets and
key-value pairs.</p>

<p>slot number { key = value ... }</p>

<p>More than one key-value pair may be used within a slot
description.</p>

<p>A key-value pair is composed of, keyword = value.</p>

<p>The following keywords are valid:</p>

<p>description A Description of the slot. PKCS#11v2.20
defined this as a 64-byte max character-string.</p>

<p>stdll This keyword is used to define the name of the
stdll or token library that will be used for this slot. The
stdll is an avail- able token library in opencryptoki.</p>

<p>manufacturer This keyword is used to name the ID of the
slot manufacturer. PKCS#11v2.20 defines this as a 32 byte
long string.</p>

<p>hwversion Version number of the slots hardware, if any.
The version num- ber is composed of a major version number
(the integer portion of the version) and a minor version
number (the hundredths por- tion of the version). For
example, version 1.2, major = 1, minor = 2</p>

<p>firmwareversion Version number of the slots firmware, if
any. The version num- ber is composed of a major version
number (the integer portion of the version) and a minor
version number (the hundredths por- tion of the
version).</p>

<p>confname If the slot is associated with a token that has
its own configu- ration file, this option identifies the
name of that configura- tion file. For example,
confname=ep11tok.conf</p>

<p>Notes The pound sign (#) is used to indicate a comment.
Both the comment character and any text after it, up to the
end of the line, are ignored. The comment character cannot
be used inside the brackets of slot descriptions, as this
will cause a syntax error.</p>
