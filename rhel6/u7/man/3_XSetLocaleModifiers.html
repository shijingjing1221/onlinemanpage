<p>XSupportsLocale(3) XLIB FUNCTIONS XSupportsLocale(3)</p>

<p>NAME XSupportsLocale, XSetLocaleModifiers - determine
locale support and configure locale modifiers</p>

<p>SYNTAX Bool XSupportsLocale(void);</p>

<p>char *XSetLocaleModifiers(char *modifier_list);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS modifier_list Specifies the modifiers.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The XSupportsLocale function returns True if
Xlib functions are capable of operating under the current
locale. If it returns False, Xlib locale-dependent functions
for which the XLocaleNotSupported return status is defined
will return XLocaleNotSupported. Other Xlib locale-
dependent routines will operate in the C locale.</p>

<p>The XSetLocaleModifiers function sets the X modifiers
for the current locale setting. The modifier_list argument
is a null-terminated string of the form {@category=value},
that is, having zero or more con- catenated @category=value
entries, where category is a category name and value is the
(possibly empty) setting for that category. The values are
encoded in the current locale. Category names are restricted
to the POSIX Portable Filename Character Set.</p>

<p>The local host X locale modifiers announcer (on
POSIX-compliant sys- tems, the XMODIFIERS environment
variable) is appended to the modi- fier_list to provide
default values on the local host. If a given cat- egory
appears more than once in the list, the first setting in the
list is used. If a given category is not included in the
full modifier list, the category is set to an
implementation-dependent default for the current locale. An
empty value for a category explicitly specifies the
implementation-dependent default.</p>

<p>If the function is successful, it returns a pointer to a
string. The contents of the string are such that a
subsequent call with that string (in the same locale) will
restore the modifiers to the same settings. If modifier_list
is a NULL pointer, XSetLocaleModifiers also returns a
pointer to such a string, and the current locale modifiers
are not changed.</p>

<p>If invalid values are given for one or more modifier
categories sup- ported by the locale, a NULL pointer is
returned, and none of the cur- rent modifiers are
changed.</p>

<p>At program startup, the modifiers that are in effect are
unspecified until the first successful call to set them.
Whenever the locale is changed, the modifiers that are in
effect become unspecified until the next successful call to
set them. Clients should always call XSetLo- caleModifiers
with a non-NULL modifier_list after setting the locale
before they call any locale-dependent Xlib routine.</p>

<p>The only standard modifier category currently defined is
im, which identifies the desired input method. The values
for input method are not standardized. A single locale may
use multiple input methods, switching input method under
user control. The modifier may specify the initial input
method in effect or an ordered list of input methods.
Multiple input methods may be specified in a single im value
string in an implementation-dependent manner.</p>

<p>The returned modifiers string is owned by Xlib and
should not be modi- fied or freed by the client. It may be
freed by Xlib after the current locale or modifiers are
changed. Until freed, it will not be modified by Xlib.</p>
