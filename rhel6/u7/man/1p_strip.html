<p>STRIP(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual STRIP(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME strip - remove unnecessary information from
executable files (DEVELOP- MENT)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS strip file...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The strip utility shall remove from
executable files named by the file operands any information
the implementor deems unnecessary for execu- tion of those
files. The nature of that information is unspecified. The
effect of strip shall be similar to the use of the -s option
to c99 or fort77.</p>

<p>OPTIONS None.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p>file A pathname referring to an executable file.</p>

<p>STDIN Not used.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES The input files shall be in the form of
executable files successfully produced by any compiler
defined by this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of strip:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in
arguments).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT Not used.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES The strip utility shall produce executable
files of unspecified format.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 Successful completion.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE Historically, this utility has been used to
remove the symbol table from an executable file. It was
included since it is known that the amount of symbolic
information can amount to several megabytes; the ability to
remove it in a portable manner was deemed important, espe-
cially for smaller systems.</p>

<p>The behavior of strip is said to be the same as the -s
option to a com- piler. While the end result is essentially
the same, it is not required to be identical.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
