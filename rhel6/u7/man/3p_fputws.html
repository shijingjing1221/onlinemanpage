<p>FPUTWS(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual FPUTWS(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME fputws - put a wide-character string on a
stream</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdio.h&gt; #include
&lt;wchar.h&gt;</p>

<p>int fputws(const wchar_t *restrict ws, FILE *restrict
stream);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The fputws() function shall write a
character string corresponding to the (null-terminated)
wide-character string pointed to by ws to the stream pointed
to by stream. No character corresponding to the termi-
nating null wide-character code shall be written.</p>

<p>The st_ctime and st_mtime fields of the file shall be
marked for update between the successful execution of
fputws() and the next successful completion of a call to
fflush() or fclose() on the same stream or a call to exit()
or abort().</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, fputws() shall
return a non-negative num- ber. Otherwise, it shall return
-1, set an error indicator for the stream, and set errno to
indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS Refer to fputwc().</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The fputws() function does not append
a &lt;newline&gt;.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
