<p>NAME pnmcut - replaced by pamcut</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pnmcut was obsoleted by
pamcut(1),introducedwithNetpbm9.20(May 2001). pamcut is
backward compatible with pnmcut, plus adds many additional
functions, including the ability to process PAM images.</p>

<p>pnmcut remained in the Netpbm package until Netpbm 10.46
(March 2009) because of hopes that it had fewer bugs than
pamcut due to its age. But now it would just be clutter.</p>

<p>In Netpbm before 9.20, use the manual for pamcut with
pnmcut. Features that are in pamcut but not pnmcut are
indicated by statements that they didnt exist before
9.20.</p>
