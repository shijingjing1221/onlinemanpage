<p>NAME lwp-request, GET, POST, HEAD - Simple command line
user agent</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS lwp-request [-afPuUsSedvhx] [-m method] [-b
base URL] [-t timeout] [-i if-modified-since] [-c
content-type] [-C credentials] [-p proxy-url] [-o format]
url...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program can be used to send requests to
WWW servers and your local file system. The request content
for POST and PUT methods is read from stdin. The content of
the response is printed on stdout. Error messages are
printed on stderr. The program returns a status value
indicating the number of URLs that failed.</p>

<p>The options are:</p>

<p>-m &lt;method&gt; Set which method to use for the
request. If this option is not used, then the method is
derived from the name of the program.</p>

<p>-f Force request through, even if the program believes
that the method is illegal. The server might reject the
request eventually.</p>

<p>-b &lt;uri&gt; This URI will be used as the base URI for
resolving all relative URIs given as argument.</p>

<p>-t &lt;timeout&gt; Set the timeout value for the
requests. The timeout is the amount of time that the program
will wait for a response from the remote server before it
fails. The default unit for the timeout value is seconds.
You might append &quot;m&quot; or &quot;h&quot; to the
timeout value to make it minutes or hours, respectively. The
default timeout is 3m, i.e. 3 minutes.</p>

<p>-i &lt;time&gt; Set the If-Modified-Since header in the
request. If time is the name of a file, use the modification
timestamp for this file. If time is not a file, it is parsed
as a literal date. Take a look at HTTP::Date for recognized
formats.</p>

<p>-c &lt;content-type&gt; Set the Content-Type for the
request. This option is only allowed for requests that take
a content, i.e. POST and PUT. You can force methods to take
content by using the &quot;-f&quot; option together with
&quot;-c&quot;. The default Content-Type for POST is
&quot;application/x-www-form-urlencoded&quot;. The default
Content-type for the others is &quot;text/plain&quot;.</p>

<p>-p &lt;proxy-url&gt; Set the proxy to be used for the
requests. The program also loads proxy settings from the
environment. You can disable this with the &quot;-P&quot;
option.</p>

<p>-P Dont load proxy settings from environment.</p>

<p>-H &lt;header&gt; Send this HTTP header with each
request. You can specify several, e.g.:</p>

<p>lwp-request -H &rsquo;Referer: http://other.url/&rsquo;
-H &rsquo;Host: somehost&rsquo; http://this.url/</p>

<p>-C &lt;username&gt;:&lt;password&gt; Provide credentials
for documents that are protected by Basic Authentication. If
the document is protected and you did not specify the
username and password with this option, then you will be
prompted to provide these values.</p>

<p>The following options controls what is displayed by the
program:</p>

<p>-u Print request method and absolute URL as requests are
made.</p>

<p>-U Print request headers in addition to request method
and absolute URL.</p>

<p>-s Print response status code. This option is always on
for HEAD requests.</p>

<p>-S Print response status chain. This shows redirect and
authorization requests that are handled by the library.</p>

<p>-e Print response headers. This option is always on for
HEAD requests.</p>

<p>-d Do not print the content of the response.</p>

<p>-o &lt;format&gt; Process HTML content in various ways
before printing it. If the content type of the response is
not HTML, then this option has no effect. The legal format
values are; text, ps, links, html and dump.</p>

<p>If you specify the text format then the HTML will be
formatted as plain latin1 text. If you specify the ps format
then it will be formatted as Postscript.</p>

<p>The links format will output all links found in the HTML
document. Relative links will be expanded to absolute
ones.</p>

<p>The html format will reformat the HTML code and the dump
format will just dump the HTML syntax tree.</p>

<p>Note that the &quot;HTML-Tree&quot; distribution needs
to be installed for this option to work. In addition the
&quot;HTML-Format&quot; distribution needs to be installed
for -o text or -o ps to work.</p>

<p>-v Print the version number of the program and quit.</p>

<p>-h Print usage message and quit.</p>

<p>-a Set text(ascii) mode for content input and output. If
this option is not used, content input and output is done in
binary mode.</p>

<p>Because this program is implemented using the LWP
library, it will only support the protocols that LWP
supports.</p>
