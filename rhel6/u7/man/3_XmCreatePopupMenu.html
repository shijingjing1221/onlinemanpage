<p>NAME XmCreatePopupMenu A RowColumn widget convenience
creation function</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;Xm/RowColumn.h&gt; Widget
XmCreatePopupMenu( Widget parent, String name, ArgList
arglist, Cardinal argcount);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION XmCreatePopupMenu creates an instance of a
RowColumn widget of type XmMENU_POPUP and returns the
associated widget ID. When this function is used to create
the Popup menu pane, a MenuShell widget is automati- cally
created as the parent of the menu pane. The parent of the
MenuShell widget is the widget indicated by the parent
parameter.</p>

<p>XmCreatePopupMenu is provided as a convenience function
for creating RowColumn widgets configured to operate as
Popup menu panes and is not implemented as a separate widget
class.</p>

<p>The PopupMenu is used as the first menu pane within a
PopupMenu system; all other menu panes are of the Pulldown
type. A Popup menu pane dis- plays a 3-D shadow, unless the
feature is disabled by the application. The shadow appears
around the edge of the menu pane.</p>

<p>The Popup menu pane must be created as the child of a
MenuShell widget in order to function properly when it is
incorporated into a menu. If the application uses this
convenience function for creating a Popup menu pane, the
MenuShell is automatically created as the real parent of the
menu pane. If the application does not use this convenience
func- tion to create the RowColumn to function as a Popup
menu pane, it is the application s responsibility to create
the MenuShell widget.</p>

<p>To access the PopupMenu, the application must first
position the widget using the XmMenuPosition function and
then manage it using XtMan- ageChild.</p>

<p>parent Specifies the parent widget ID</p>

<p>name Specifies the name of the created widget</p>

<p>arglist Specifies the argument list</p>

<p>argcount Specifies the number of attribute/value pairs
in the argument list (arglist)</p>

<p>Popup menu panes support tear-off capabilities for
tear-off menus through XmRowColumn resources. For a complete
definition of RowColumn and its associated resources, see
XmRowColumn(3).</p>

<p>RETURN Returns the RowColumn widget ID.</p>
