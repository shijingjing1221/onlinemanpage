<p>NAME udplite - Lightweight User Datagram Protocol</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;</p>

<p>sockfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM,
IPPROTO_UDPLITE);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This is an implementation of the Lightweight
User Datagram Protocol (UDP-Lite), as described in RFC
3828.</p>

<p>UDP-Lite is an extension of UDP (RFC 768) to support
variable-length checksums. This has advantages for some
types of multimedia transport that may be able to make use
of slightly damaged datagrams, rather than having them
discarded by lower-layer protocols.</p>

<p>The variable-length checksum coverage is set via a
setsockopt(2) option. If this option is not set, the only
difference to UDP is in using a different IP protocol
identifier (IANA number 136).</p>

<p>The UDP-Lite implementation is a full extension of
udp(7), i.e., it shares the same API and API behaviour, and
in addition offers two socket options to control the
checksum coverage.</p>

<p>Address Format UDP-Litev4 uses the sockaddr_in address
format described in ip(7). UDP-Litev6 uses the sockaddr_in6
address format described in ipv6(7).</p>

<p>Socket Options To set or get a UDP-Lite socket option,
call getsockopt(2) to read or setsockopt(2) to write the
option with the option level argument set to
IPPROTO_UDPLITE. In addition, all IPPROTO_UDP socket options
are valid on a UDP-Lite socket. See udp(7) for more
information.</p>

<p>The following two options are specific to UDP-Lite.</p>

<p>UDPLITE_SEND_CSCOV This option sets the sender checksum
coverage and takes an int as argument, with a checksum
coverage value in the range 0..2^16-1.</p>

<p>A value of 0 means that the entire datagram is always
covered. Values from 1-7 are illegal (RFC 3828, 3.1) and are
rounded up to the minimum coverage of 8.</p>

<p>With regard to IPv6 jumbograms (RFC 2675), the
UDP-Litev6 check- sum coverage is limited to the first
2^16-1 octets, as per RFC 3828, 3.5. Higher values are
therefore silently truncated to 2^16-1. If in doubt, the
current coverage value can always be queried using
getsockopt(2).</p>

<p>UDPLITE_RECV_CSCOV This is the receiver-side analogue
and uses the same argument format and value range as
UDPLITE_SEND_CSCOV. This option is not required to enable
traffic with partial checksum coverage. Its function is that
of a traffic filter: when enabled, it instructs the kernel
to drop all packets which have a coverage less than the
specified coverage value.</p>

<p>When the value of UDPLITE_RECV_CSCOV exceeds the actual
packet coverage, incoming packets are silently dropped, but
may generate a warning message in the system log.</p>

<p>ERRORS All errors documented for udp(7) may be returned.
UDP-Lite does not add further errors.</p>

<p>BUGS Where glibc support is missing, the following
definitions are needed:</p>

<p>#define IPPROTO_UDPLITE 136 #define UDPLITE_SEND_CSCOV
10 #define UDPLITE_RECV_CSCOV 11</p>

<p>FILES /proc/net/snmp - basic UDP-Litev4 statistics
counters. /proc/net/snmp6 - basic UDP-Litev6 statistics
counters.</p>

<p>VERSIONS UDP-Litev4/v6 first appeared in Linux
2.6.20.</p>
