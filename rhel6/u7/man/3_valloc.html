<p>POSIX_MEMALIGN(3) Linux Programmer s Manual
POSIX_MEMALIGN(3)</p>

<p>NAME posix_memalign, memalign, valloc - Allocate aligned
memory</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</p>

<p>int posix_memalign(void **memptr, size_t alignment,
size_t size);</p>

<p>#include &lt;malloc.h&gt;</p>

<p>void *valloc(size_t size); void *memalign(size_t
boundary, size_t size);</p>

<p>Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
feature_test_macros(7)):</p>

<p>posix_memalign(): _POSIX_C_SOURCE &gt;= 200112L ||
_XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;= 600</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The function posix_memalign() allocates size
bytes and places the address of the allocated memory in
*memptr. The address of the allo- cated memory will be a
multiple of alignment, which must be a power of two and a
multiple of sizeof(void *). If size is 0, then posix_mema-
lign() returns either NULL, or a unique pointer value that
can later be successfully passed to free().</p>

<p>The obsolete function memalign() allocates size bytes
and returns a pointer to the allocated memory. The memory
address will be a multiple of boundary, which must be a
power of two.</p>

<p>The obsolete function valloc() allocates size bytes and
returns a pointer to the allocated memory. The memory
address will be a multiple of the page size. It is
equivalent to memalign(sysconf(_SC_PAGE- SIZE),size).</p>

<p>For all three routines, the memory is not zeroed.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE memalign() and valloc() return the pointer
to the allocated memory, or NULL if the request fails.</p>

<p>posix_memalign() returns zero on success, or one of the
error values listed in the next section on failure. Note
that errno is not set.</p>

<p>ERRORS EINVAL The alignment argument was not a power of
two, or was not a mul- tiple of sizeof(void *).</p>

<p>ENOMEM There was insufficient memory to fulfill the
allocation request.</p>

<p>VERSIONS The functions memalign() and valloc() have been
available in all Linux libc libraries. The function
posix_memalign() is available since glibc 2.1.91.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO The function valloc() appeared in 3.0BSD.
It is documented as being obsolete in 4.3BSD, and as legacy
in SUSv2. It does not appear in POSIX.1-2001. The function
memalign() appears in SunOS 4.1.3 but not in 4.4BSD. The
function posix_memalign() comes from POSIX.1d.</p>

<p>Headers Everybody agrees that posix_memalign() is
declared in &lt;stdlib.h&gt;.</p>

<p>On some systems memalign() is declared in
&lt;stdlib.h&gt; instead of &lt;mal- loc.h&gt;.</p>

<p>According to SUSv2, valloc() is declared in
&lt;stdlib.h&gt;. Libc4,5 and glibc declare it in
&lt;malloc.h&gt; and perhaps also in &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
(namely, if _GNU_SOURCE is defined, or _BSD_SOURCE is
defined, or, for glibc, if _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED is
defined, or, equivalently, _XOPEN_SOURCE is defined to a
value not less than 500).</p>

<p>NOTES On many systems there are alignment restrictions,
for example, on buffers used for direct block device I/O.
POSIX specifies the path- conf(path,_PC_REC_XFER_ALIGN) call
that tells what alignment is needed. Now one can use
posix_memalign() to satisfy this requirement.</p>

<p>posix_memalign() verifies that alignment matches the
requirements detailed above. memalign() may not check that
the boundary argument is correct.</p>

<p>POSIX requires that memory obtained from
posix_memalign() can be freed using free(3). Some systems
provide no way to reclaim memory allocated with memalign()
or valloc() (because one can only pass to free(3) a pointer
gotten from malloc(3), while, for example, memalign() would
call malloc(3) and then align the obtained value). The glibc
implemen- tation allows memory obtained from any of these
three routines to be reclaimed with free(3).</p>

<p>The glibc malloc(3) always returns 8-byte aligned memory
addresses, so these routines are only needed if you require
larger alignment values.</p>
