<p>DEVICE_SCHEDULE_CALL(9) Device drivers infrastructure
DEVICE_SCHEDULE_CALL(9)</p>

<p>NAME device_schedule_callback_owner - helper to schedule
a callback for a device</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS int device_schedule_callback_owner(struct
device * dev, void (*func) (struct device *), struct module
* owner);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS dev device.</p>

<p>func callback function to invoke later.</p>

<p>owner module owning the callback routine</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Attribute methods must not unregister
themselves or their parent device (which would amount to the
same thing). Attempts to do so will deadlock, since
unregistration is mutually exclusive with driver
callbacks.</p>

<p>Instead methods can call this routine, which will
attempt to allocate and schedule a workqueue request to call
back func with dev as its argument in the workqueue&acute;s
process context. dev will be pinned until func returns.</p>

<p>This routine is usually called via the inline
device_schedule_callback, which automatically sets owner to
THIS_MODULE.</p>

<p>Returns 0 if the request was submitted, -ENOMEM if
storage could not be allocated, -ENODEV if a reference to
owner isn&acute;t available.</p>

<p>NOTE This routine won&acute;t work if CONFIG_SYSFS
isn&acute;t set! It uses an underlying sysfs routine (since
it is intended for use by attribute methods), and if sysfs
isn&acute;t available you&acute;ll get nothing but
-ENOSYS.</p>
