<p>KIBITZ(1) KIBITZ(1)</p>

<p>NAME kibitz - allow two people to interact with one
shell</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS kibitz [ kibitz-args ] user [ program
program-args... ] kibitz [ kibitz-args ] user@host [ program
program-args... ]</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION kibitz allows two (or more) people to
interact with one shell (or any arbitrary program). Uses
include:</p>

<p>&middot; A novice user can ask an expert user for help.
Using kib- itz, the expert can see what the user is doing,
and offer advice or show how to do it right.</p>

<p>&middot; By running kibitz and then starting a
full-screen editor, people may carry out a conversation,
retaining the ability to scroll backwards, save the entire
conversation, or even edit it while in progress.</p>

<p>&middot; People can team up on games, document editing,
or other cooperative tasks where each person has strengths
and weak- nesses that complement one another.</p>

<p>USAGE To start kibitz, user1 runs kibitz with the
argument of the user to kibitz. For example:</p>

<p>kibitz user2</p>

<p>kibitz starts a new shell (or another program, if given
on the command line), while prompting user2 to run kibitz.
If user2 runs kibitz as directed, the keystrokes of both
users become the input of the shell. Similarly, both users
receive the output from the shell.</p>

<p>To terminate kibitz it suffices to terminate the shell
itself. For example, if either user types ^D (and the shell
accepts this to be EOF), the shell terminates followed by
kibitz.</p>

<p>Normally, all characters are passed uninterpreted.
However, if the escape character (described when kibitz
starts) is issued, the user may talk directly to the kibitz
interpreter. Any Expect(1) or Tcl(3) com- mands may be
given. Also, job control may be used while in the inter-
preter, to, for example, suspend or restart kibitz.</p>

<p>Various processes can provide various effects. For
example, you can emulate a two-way write(1) session with the
command:</p>

<p>kibitz user2 sleep 1000000</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS kibitz takes arguments, these should also be
separated by whitespace.</p>

<p>The -noproc flag runs kibitz with no process underneath.
Characters are passed to the other kibitz. This is
particularly useful for con- necting multiple interactive
processes together. In this mode, charac- ters are not
echoed back to the typist.</p>

<p>-noescape disables the escape character.</p>

<p>-escape char sets the escape character. The default
escape character is ^].</p>

<p>-silent turns off informational messages describing what
kibitz is doing to initiate a connection.</p>

<p>-tty ttyname defines the tty to which the invitation
should be sent.</p>

<p>If you start kibitz to user2 on a remote computer,
kibitz performs a rlogin to the remote computer with your
current username. The flag -proxy username causes rlogin to
use username for the remote login (e.g. if your account on
the remote computer has a different username). If the -proxy
flag is not given, kibitz tries to determine your current
username by (in that order) inspecting the environment
variables USER and LOGNAME, then by using the commands
whoami and logname.</p>

<p>The arguments -noescape and -escape can also be given by
user2 when prompted to run kibitz.</p>

<p>MORE THAN TWO USERS The current implementation of kibitz
explicitly understands only two users, however, it is
nonetheless possible to have a three (or more) -way kibitz,
by kibitzing another kibitz. For example, the following
command runs kibitz with the current user, user2, and
user3:</p>

<p>% kibitz user2 kibitz user3</p>

<p>Additional users may be added by simply appending more
&quot;kibitz user&quot; commands.</p>

<p>The xkibitz script is similar to kibitz but supports the
ability to add additional users (and drop them)
dynamically.</p>

<p>CAVEATS kibitz assumes the 2nd user has the same
terminal type and size as the 1st user. If this assumption
is incorrect, graphical programs may dis- play oddly.</p>

<p>kibitz handles character graphics, but cannot handle
bitmapped graph- ics. Thus,</p>

<p>% xterm -e kibitz will work % kibitz xterm will not
work</p>

<p>However, you can get the effect of the latter command by
using xkibitz (see SEE ALSO below). kibitz uses the same
permissions as used by rlogin, rsh, etc. Thus, you can only
kibitz to users at hosts for which you can rlogin.
Similarly, kibitz will prompt for a password on the remote
host if rlogin would.</p>

<p>If you kibitz to users at remote hosts, kibitz needs to
distinguish your prompt from other things that may precede
it during login. (Ide- ally, the end of it is preferred but
any part should suffice.) If you have an unusual prompt, set
the environment variable EXPECT_PROMPT to an egrep(1)-style
regular expression. Brackets should be preceded with one
backslash in ranges, and three backslashes for literal
brackets. The default prompt r.e. is &quot;($|%|#)
&quot;.</p>

<p>kibitz requires the kibitz program on both hosts. kibitz
requires expect(1).</p>

<p>By comparison, the xkibitz script uses the X
authorization mechanism for inter-host communication so it
does not need to login, recognize your prompt, or require
kibitz on the remote host. It does however need permission
to access the other X servers.</p>

<p>BUGS An early version of Suns tmpfs had a bug in it that
causes kibitz to blow up. If kibitz reports &quot;error
flushing ...: Is a directory&quot; ask Sun for patch
#100174.</p>

<p>If your Expect is not compiled with multiple-process
support (i.e., you do not have a working select or poll),
you will not be able to run kib- itz.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT The environment variable SHELL is used to
determine the shell to start, if no other program is given
on the command line.</p>

<p>If the environment variable EXPECT_PROMPT exists, it is
taken as a reg- ular expression which matches the end of
your login prompt (but does not otherwise occur while
logging in). See also CAVEATS above.</p>

<p>If the environment variables USER or LOGNAME are
defined, they are used to determine the current user name
for a kibitz to a remote computer. See description of the
-proxy option in ARGUMENTS above.</p>
