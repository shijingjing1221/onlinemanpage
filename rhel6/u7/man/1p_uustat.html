<p>UUSTAT(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual UUSTAT(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME uustat - uucp status inquiry and job control</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS uustat [ -q| -k jobid| -r jobid]</p>

<p>uustat [-s system][-u user]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The uustat utility shall display the status
of, or cancel, previously specified uucp requests, or
provide general status on uucp connections to other
systems.</p>

<p>When no options are given, uustat shall write to
standard output the status of all uucp requests issued by
the current user.</p>

<p>Typical implementations of this utility require a
communications line configured to use the Base Definitions
volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Chapter 11, General Terminal
Interface, but other communications means may be used. On
systems where there are no available communications means
(either temporarily or permanently), this utility shall
write an error message describing the problem and exit with
a non-zero exit sta- tus.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The uustat utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>The following options shall be supported:</p>

<p>-q Write the jobs queued for each machine.</p>

<p>-k jobid Kill the uucp request whose job identification
is jobid. The application shall ensure that the killed uucp
request belongs to the person invoking uustat unless that
user has appropriate privileges.</p>

<p>-r jobid Rejuvenate jobid. The files associated with
jobid are touched so that their modification time is set to
the current time. This prevents the cleanup program from
deleting the job until the jobs modification time reaches
the limit imposed by the program.</p>

<p>-s system Write the status of all uucp requests for
remote system system.</p>

<p>-u user Write the status of all uucp requests issued by
user.</p>

<p>OPERANDS None.</p>

<p>STDIN Not used.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of uus- tat:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in
arguments).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error, and informative messages written
to standard output.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT The standard output shall consist of information
about each job selected, in an unspecified format. The
information shall include at least the job ID, the user ID
or name, and the remote system name.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 Successful completion.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
