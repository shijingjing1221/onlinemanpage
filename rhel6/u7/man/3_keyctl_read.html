<p>KEYCTL_READ(3) Linux Key Management Calls
KEYCTL_READ(3)</p>

<p>NAME keyctl_read - Read a key</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;keyutils.h&gt;</p>

<p>long keyctl_read(key_serial_t key, char *buffer,
size_tbuflen);</p>

<p>long keyctl_read_alloc(key_serial_t key, char
**_buffer);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION keyctl_read() reads the payload of a key if
the key type supports it.</p>

<p>The caller must have read permission on a key to be able
to read it.</p>

<p>buffer and buflen specify the buffer into which the
payload data will be placed. If the buffer is too small, the
full size of the payload will be returned, and no copy will
take place.</p>

<p>keyctl_read_alloc() is similar to keyctl_read() except
that it allo- cates a buffer big enough to hold the payload
data and places the data in it. If successful, A pointer to
the buffer is placed in *_buffer. The caller must free the
buffer.</p>

<p>READING KEYRINGS This call can be used to list the
contents of a keyring. The data is presented to the user as
an array of key_serial_t values, each of which corresponds
to a key to which the keyring holds a link.</p>

<p>The size of the keyring will be sizeof(key_serial_t)
multiplied by the number of keys. The size of key_serial_t
is invariant across different word sizes, though the
byte-ordering is as appropriate for the kernel.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success keyctl_read() returns the amount
of data placed into the buffer. If the buffer was too small,
then the size of buffer required will be returned, but no
data will be transferred. On error, the value -1 will be
returned and errno will have been set to an appropriate
error.</p>

<p>On success keyctl_read_alloc() returns the amount of
data in the buffer. On error, the value -1 will be returned
and errno will have been set to an appropriate error.</p>

<p>ERRORS ENOKEY The key specified is invalid.</p>

<p>EKEYEXPIRED The key specified has expired.</p>

<p>EKEYREVOKED The key specified had been revoked.</p>

<p>EACCES The key exists, but is not readable by the
calling process.</p>

<p>EOPNOTSUPP The key type does not support reading of the
payload data.</p>

<p>LINKING This is a library function that can be found in
libkeyutils. When linking, -lkeyutils should be specified to
the linker.</p>
