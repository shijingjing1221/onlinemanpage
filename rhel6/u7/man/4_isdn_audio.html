<p>NAME isdn_audio - audio extension of ttyI ISDN character
devices</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This document describes the audio related
extensions of the modem emu- lation, provided by
/dev/ttyIx.</p>

<p>The ISDN tty devices are equipped with a modem emulation
implementing a set of traditional and some special AT
commands. This provides easy use together with almost all
communication software that uses modem com- mands:
minicom(1), seyon(1), XCept(1), uucico(8), mgetty(8),
dip(8), pppd(8) and more. When enabled during kernel
configuration, the emula- tor is capable of a reduced set of
commands to support audio. To use audio features, an ISDN
card with a audio-capable low-level driver is needed.
Currently the only audio-capable drivers are the teles and
HiSax driver.</p>

<p>The port speed of the ISDN tty devices is always 64000
bps.</p>

<p>AUDIO RELATED AT COMMAND SET This description does not
include the standard AT command set. For a description of
the standard AT command set, provided by the Linux ISDN
subsystem, see ttyI(4). All commands starting with AT+
except AT+FCLASS are enabled only, if audio mode is active.
The following audio related AT commands are supported by
ISDN tty devices:</p>

<p>AT+FCLASS=0 Disable audio mode (default). This command
sets register 18 to 4.</p>

<p>AT+FCLASS=8 Enable audio mode. This command sets
register 18 to 5.</p>

<p>AT+FCLASS=? Show possible modes.</p>

<p>AT+FCLASS? Show current mode.</p>

<p>AT+VNH=x No function, provided for compatibility
only.</p>

<p>AT+VNH=? Always showing &quot;1&quot;.</p>

<p>AT+VNH? Always showing &quot;1&quot;.</p>

<p>AT+VIP Reset all audio parameters.</p>

<p>AT+VLS=x Select line x, where x is one of the following:
0 = No device. 2 = Phone line.</p>

<p>AT+VLS=? Always showing &quot;0,2&quot;.</p>

<p>AT+VLS? Show current line.</p>

<p>AT+VRX Start audio recording. See below for more
information.</p>

<p>AT+VSD=x,y Set silence-detection parameters. Possible
parameters: x = 0 ... 31 sensitivity threshold level.
(default 0 , deactivated) y = 0 ... 255 range of interval in
units of 0.1 second. (default 70)</p>

<p>AT+VSD=? Show possible parameters.</p>

<p>AT+VSD? Show current parameters.</p>

<p>AT+VSM=x Select audio data format to x, where x is: 2 =
ADPCM-2 3 = ADPCM-3 4 = ADPCM-4 5 = aLAW 6 = uLAW</p>

<p>AT+VSM=? Show possible audio data formats.</p>

<p>AT+VSM? Show current audio data format.</p>

<p>AT+VTX Start audio playback. See below for more
information.</p>

<p>GENERAL BEHAVIOUR On incoming calls, if the application
responds to a RING by sending ATA, depending on the calling
service, the emulator responds with either CONNECT (data
call) or VCON (voice call).</p>

<p>When starting audio playback or recording, the emulator
responds with CONNECT. After that, the data transfer
protocol described below is used. It is possible to initiate
full duplex data transfer by issuing AT+VRX+VTX in a single
command. In this case, no CONNECT message is sent to the
application and the protocol described below is started
immediately.</p>

<p>When stopping audio playback or recording, the message
returned by the emulator depends on how the data transfer is
stopped. If the data transfer is stopped by a remote hangup,
NO CARRIER is sent to the application, while stopping data
transfer with one of the DLE sequences, VCON is sent. In any
case, the message is preceeded by the appropriate DLE
sequence for end of audio data and/or abort respec-
tively.</p>

<p>On outgoing voice calls, the emulator responds with VCON
upon connec- tion setup.</p>

<p>AUDIO DATA FORMAT When recording or playing back audio
data, a kind of modified bisync protocol is used. When
recording audio data, the modem emulator is con- sidered to
be the sender, while the application is the receiver. When
playing back, this relationship is reversed: The modem
emulator acts as receiver, while the application is the
sender. With the bisync proto- col the character DLE (0x10)
has a special meaning and is used like an escape character.
It is always followed by a second character which has the
following meanings defined:</p>

<p>ETX (0x03) End of audio data. This code has to be sent
by the sender, indi- cating end of audio data.</p>

<p>DC4 (0x14) Abort sending. This code has to be sent by
the receiver, when it wishes to abort receiving data. The
sender has to reply by stop sending data and finally
indicating end of audio data.</p>

<p>DLE (0x10) a single byte with value 0x10 in the data
stream.</p>

<p>0 Touch-tone &quot;0&quot; received. Valid only in
direction from emulator to application.</p>

<p>1 Touch-tone &quot;1&quot; received. Valid only in
direction from emulator to application.</p>

direction from emulator to application.</p>

direction from emulator to application.</p>

<p>4 Touch-tone &quot;4&quot; received. Valid only in
direction from emulator to application.</p>

direction from emulator to application.</p>

<p>6 Touch-tone &quot;6&quot; received. Valid only in
direction from emulator to application.</p>

direction from emulator to application.</p>
