<p>NAME cjpeg - compress an image file to a JPEG file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS cjpeg [ options ] [ filename ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION cjpeg compresses the named image file, or
the standard input if no file is named, and produces a
JPEG/JFIF file on the standard output. The currently
supported input file formats are: PPM (PBMPLUS color
format), PGM (PBMPLUS gray-scale format), BMP, Targa, and
RLE (Utah Raster Toolkit format). (RLE is supported only if
the URT library is avail- able.)</p>

<p>OPTIONS All switch names may be abbreviated; for
example, -grayscale may be written -gray or -gr. Most of the
&quot;basic&quot; switches can be abbreviated to as little
as one letter. Upper and lower case are equivalent (thus
-BMP is the same as -bmp). British spellings are also
accepted (e.g., -greyscale), though for brevity these are
not mentioned below.</p>

<p>The basic switches are:</p>

<p>-quality N[,...] Scale quantization tables to adjust
image quality. Quality is 0 (worst) to 100 (best); default
is 75. (See below for more info.)</p>

<p>-grayscale Create monochrome JPEG file from color input.
Be sure to use this switch when compressing a grayscale BMP
file, because cjpeg isnt bright enough to notice whether a
BMP file uses only shades of gray. By saying -grayscale,
youll get a smaller JPEG file that takes less time to
process.</p>

<p>-optimize Perform optimization of entropy encoding
parameters. Without this, default encoding parameters are
used. -optimize usually makes the JPEG file a little
smaller, but cjpeg runs somewhat slower and needs much more
memory. Image quality and speed of decompression are
unaffected by -optimize.</p>

<p>-progressive Create progressive JPEG file (see
below).</p>

<p>-targa Input file is Targa format. Targa files that
contain an &quot;iden- tification&quot; field will not be
automatically recognized by cjpeg; for such files you must
specify -targa to make cjpeg treat the input as Targa
format. For most Targa files, you wont need this switch.</p>

<p>The -quality switch lets you trade off compressed file
size against quality of the reconstructed image: the higher
the quality setting, the larger the JPEG file, and the
closer the output image will be to the original input.
Normally you want to use the lowest quality setting
(smallest file) that decompresses into something visually
indistin- guishable from the original image. For this
purpose the quality set- ting should be between 50 and 95;
the default of 75 is often about right. If you see defects
at -quality 75, then go up 5 or 10 counts at a time until
you are happy with the output image. (The optimal setting
will vary from one image to another.)</p>

<p>-quality 100 will generate a quantization table of all 1
s, minimizing loss in the quantization step (but there is
still information loss in subsampling, as well as roundoff
error). This setting is mainly of interest for experimental
purposes. Quality values above about 95 are not recommended
for normal use; the compressed file size goes up dra-
matically for hardly any gain in output image quality.</p>

<p>In the other direction, quality values below 50 will
produce very small files of low image quality. Settings
around 5 to 10 might be useful in preparing an index of a
large image library, for example. Try -quality 2 (or so) for
some amusing Cubist effects. (Note: quality values below
about 25 generate 2-byte quantization tables, which are
considered optional in the JPEG standard. cjpeg emits a
warning message when you give such a quality value, because
some other JPEG programs may be unable to decode the
resulting file. Use -baseline if you need to ensure
compatibility at low quality values.)</p>

<p>The -quality option has been extended in this version of
cjpeg to sup- port separate quality settings for luminance
and chrominance (or, in general, separate settings for every
quantization table slot.) The principle is the same as
chrominance subsampling: since the human eye is more
sensitive to spatial changes in brightness than spatial
changes in color, the chrominance components can be
quantized more than the luminance components without
incurring any visible image quality loss. However, unlike
subsampling, this feature reduces data in the frequency
domain instead of the spatial domain, which allows for more
fine- grained control. This option is useful in
quality-sensitive applica- tions, for which the artifacts
generated by subsampling may be unac- ceptable.</p>

<p>The -quality option accepts a comma-separated list of
parameters, which respectively refer to the quality levels
that should be assigned to the quantization table slots. If
there are more q-table slots than parame- ters, then the
last parameter is replicated. Thus, if only one quality
parameter is given, this is used for both luminance and
chrominance (slots 0 and 1, respectively), preserving the
legacy behavior of cjpeg v6b and prior. More (or customized)
quantization tables can be set with the -qtables option and
assigned to components with the -qslots option (see the
&quot;wizard&quot; switches below.)</p>

<p>JPEG files generated with separate luminance and
chrominance quality are fully compliant with standard JPEG
decoders.</p>

<p>CAUTION: For this setting to be useful, be sure to pass
an argument of -sample 1x1 to cjpeg to disable chrominance
subsampling. Otherwise, the default subsampling level (2x2,
AKA &quot;4:2:0&quot;) will be used.</p>

<p>The -progressive switch creates a &quot;progressive
JPEG&quot; file. In this type of JPEG file, the data is
stored in multiple scans of increasing quality. If the file
is being transmitted over a slow communications link, the
decoder can use the first scan to display a low-quality
image very quickly, and can then improve the display with
each subsequent scan. The final image is exactly equivalent
to a standard JPEG file of the same quality setting, and the
total file size is about the same --- often a little
smaller.</p>

<p>Switches for advanced users:</p>

<p>-arithmetic Use arithmetic coding. Caution: arithmetic
coded JPEG is not yet widely implemented, so many decoders
will be unable to view an arithmetic coded JPEG file at
all.</p>

<p>-dct int Use integer DCT method (default).</p>

<p>-dct fast Use fast integer DCT (less accurate).</p>

<p>-dct float Use floating-point DCT method. The float
method is very slightly more accurate than the int method,
but is much slower unless your machine has very fast
floating-point hardware. Also note that results of the
floating-point method may vary slightly across machines,
while the integer methods should give the same results
everywhere. The fast integer method is much less accu- rate
than the other two.</p>

<p>-restart N Emit a JPEG restart marker every N MCU rows,
or every N MCU blocks if &quot;B&quot; is attached to the
number. -restart 0 (the default) means no restart
markers.</p>

<p>-smooth N Smooth the input image to eliminate dithering
noise. N, ranging from 1 to 100, indicates the strength of
smoothing. 0 (the default) means no smoothing.</p>

<p>-maxmemory N Set limit for amount of memory to use in
processing large images. Value is in thousands of bytes, or
millions of bytes if &quot;M&quot; is attached to the
number. For example, -max 4m selects 4000000 bytes. If more
space is needed, temporary files will be used.</p>

<p>-outfile name Send output image to the named file, not
to standard output.</p>

<p>-verbose Enable debug printout. More -vs give more
output. Also, ver- sion information is printed at
startup.</p>

<p>-debug Same as -verbose.</p>

<p>The -restart option inserts extra markers that allow a
JPEG decoder to resynchronize after a transmission error.
Without restart markers, any damage to a compressed file
will usually ruin the image from the point of the error to
the end of the image; with restart markers, the damage is
usually confined to the portion of the image up to the next
restart marker. Of course, the restart markers occupy extra
space. We recom- mend -restart 1 for images that will be
transmitted across unreliable networks such as Usenet.</p>

<p>The -smooth option filters the input to eliminate
fine-scale noise. This is often useful when converting
dithered images to JPEG: a moder- ate smoothing factor of 10
to 50 gets rid of dithering patterns in the input file,
resulting in a smaller JPEG file and a better-looking image.
Too large a smoothing factor will visibly blur the image,
how- ever.</p>

<p>Switches for wizards:</p>

<p>-baseline Force baseline-compatible quantization tables
to be generated. This clamps quantization values to 8 bits
even at low quality settings. (This switch is poorly named,
since it does not ensure that the output is actually
baseline JPEG. For example, you can use -baseline and
-progressive together.)</p>

<p>-qtables file Use the quantization tables given in the
specified text file.</p>

<p>-qslots N[,...] Select which quantization table to use
for each color component.</p>

<p>-sample HxV[,...] Set JPEG sampling factors for each
color component.</p>

<p>-scans file Use the scan script given in the specified
text file.</p>

<p>The &quot;wizard&quot; switches are intended for
experimentation with JPEG. If you don t know what you are
doing, dot use them. These switches are documented further
in the file wizard.txt.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES This example compresses the PPM file foo.ppm
with a quality factor of 60 and saves the output as
foo.jpg:</p>

<p>cjpeg -quality 60 foo.ppm &gt; foo.jpg</p>

<p>HINTS Color GIF files are not the ideal input for JPEG;
JPEG is really intended for compressing full-color (24-bit)
images. In particular, don t try to convert cartoons, line
drawings, and other images that have only a few distinct
colors. GIF works great on these, JPEG does not. If you want
to convert a GIF to JPEG, you should experiment with cjpegs
-quality and -smooth options to get a satisfactory
conversion. -smooth 10 or so is often helpful.</p>

<p>Avoid running an image through a series of JPEG
compression/decompres- sion cycles. Image quality loss will
accumulate; after ten or so cycles the image may be
noticeably worse than it was after one cycle. Its best to
use a lossless format while manipulating an image, then
convert to JPEG format when you are ready to file the image
away.</p>

<p>The -optimize option to cjpeg is worth using when you
are making a &quot;final&quot; version for posting or
archiving. Its also a win when you are using low quality
settings to make very small JPEG files; the percent- age
improvement is often a lot more than it is on larger files.
(At present, -optimize mode is always selected when
generating progressive JPEG files.)</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT JPEGMEM If this environment variable is set,
its value is the default memory limit. The value is
specified as described for the -maxmemory switch. JPEGMEM
overrides the default value speci- fied when the program was
compiled, and itself is overridden by an explicit
-maxmemory.</p>

<p>AUTHOR Independent JPEG Group</p>

<p>BUGS Support for GIF input files was removed in cjpeg
v6b due to concerns over the Unisys LZW patent. Although
this patent expired in 2006, cjpeg still lacks GIF support,
for these historical reasons. (Conver- sion of GIF files to
JPEG is usually a bad idea anyway.)</p>

<p>Not all variants of BMP and Targa file formats are
supported.</p>

<p>The -targa switch is not a bug, its a feature. (It would
be a bug if the Targa format designers had not been
clueless.)</p>
