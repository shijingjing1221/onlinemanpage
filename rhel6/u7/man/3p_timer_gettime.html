<p>TIMER_GETOVERRUN(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
TIMER_GETOVERRUN(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME timer_getoverrun, timer_gettime, timer_settime -
per-process timers (REALTIME)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;time.h&gt;</p>

<p>int timer_getoverrun(timer_t timerid); int
timer_gettime(timer_t timerid, struct itimerspec *value);
int timer_settime(timer_t timerid, int flags, const struct
itimerspec *restrict value, struct itimerspec *restrict
ovalue);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The timer_gettime() function shall store the
amount of time until the specified timer, timerid, expires
and the reload value of the timer into the space pointed to
by the value argument. The it_value member of this structure
shall contain the amount of time before the timer expires,
or zero if the timer is disarmed. This value is returned as
the interval until timer expiration, even if the timer was
armed with absolute time. The it_interval member of value
shall contain the reload value last set by
timer_settime().</p>

<p>The timer_settime() function shall set the time until
the next expira- tion of the timer specified by timerid from
the it_value member of the value argument and arm the timer
if the it_value member of value is non-zero. If the
specified timer was already armed when timer_settime() is
called, this call shall reset the time until next expiration
to the value specified. If the it_value member of value is
zero, the timer shall be disarmed. The effect of disarming
or resetting a timer with pending expiration notifications
is unspecified.</p>

<p>If the flag TIMER_ABSTIME is not set in the argument
flags, timer_set- time() shall behave as if the time until
next expiration is set to be equal to the interval specified
by the it_value member of value. That is, the timer shall
expire in it_value nanoseconds from when the call is made.
If the flag TIMER_ABSTIME is set in the argument flags,
timer_settime() shall behave as if the time until next
expiration is set to be equal to the difference between the
absolute time specified by the it_value member of value and
the current value of the clock associated with timerid. That
is, the timer shall expire when the clock reaches the value
specified by the it_value member of value. If the specified
time has already passed, the function shall succeed and the
expiration notification shall be made.</p>

<p>The reload value of the timer shall be set to the value
specified by the it_interval member of value. When a timer
is armed with a non-zero it_interval, a periodic (or
repetitive) timer is specified.</p>

<p>Time values that are between two consecutive
non-negative integer mul- tiples of the resolution of the
specified timer shall be rounded up to the larger multiple
of the resolution. Quantization error shall not cause the
timer to expire earlier than the rounded time value.</p>

<p>If the argument ovalue is not NULL, the timer_settime()
function shall store, in the location referenced by ovalue,
a value representing the previous amount of time before the
timer would have expired, or zero if the timer was disarmed,
together with the previous timer reload value. Timers shall
not expire before their scheduled time.</p>

<p>Only a single signal shall be queued to the process for
a given timer at any point in time. When a timer for which a
signal is still pending expires, no signal shall be queued,
and a timer overrun shall occur. When a timer expiration
signal is delivered to or accepted by a pro- cess, if the
implementation supports the Realtime Signals Extension, the
timer_getoverrun() function shall return the timer
expiration over- run count for the specified timer. The
overrun count returned contains the number of extra timer
expirations that occurred between the time the signal was
generated (queued) and when it was delivered or accepted, up
to but not including an implementation-defined maximum of
{DELAYTIMER_MAX}. If the number of such extra expirations is
greater than or equal to {DELAYTIMER_MAX}, then the overrun
count shall be set to {DELAYTIMER_MAX}. The value returned
by timer_getoverrun() shall apply to the most recent
expiration signal delivery or acceptance for the timer. If
no expiration signal has been delivered for the timer, or if
the Realtime Signals Extension is not supported, the return
value of timer_getoverrun() is unspecified.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE If the timer_getoverrun() function
succeeds, it shall return the timer expiration overrun count
as explained above.</p>

<p>If the timer_gettime() or timer_settime() functions
succeed, a value of 0 shall be returned.</p>

<p>If an error occurs for any of these functions, the value
-1 shall be returned, and errno set to indicate the
error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The timer_getoverrun(), timer_gettime(), and
timer_settime() functions shall fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The timerid argument does not correspond to an ID
returned by timer_create() but not yet deleted by
timer_delete().</p>

<p>The timer_settime() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL A value structure specified a nanosecond value
less than zero or greater than or equal to 1000 million, and
the it_value member of that structure did not specify zero
seconds and nanoseconds.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE Practical clocks tick at a finite rate, with
rates of 100 hertz and 1000 hertz being common. The inverse
of this tick rate is the clock resolution, also called the
clock granularity, which in either case is expressed as a
time duration, being 10 milliseconds and 1 millisecond
respectively for these common rates. The granularity of
practical clocks implies that if one reads a given clock
twice in rapid succes- sion, one may get the same time value
twice; and that timers must wait for the next clock tick
after the theoretical expiration time, to ensure that a
timer never returns too soon. Note also that the granularity
of the clock may be significantly coarser than the resolu-
tion of the data format used to set and get time and
interval values. Also note that some implementations may
choose to adjust time and/or interval values to exactly
match the ticks of the underlying clock.</p>

<p>This volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 defines functions
that allow an application to determine the
implementation-supported resolution for the clocks and
requires an implementation to document the resolution
supported for timers and nanosleep() if they differ from the
supported clock resolution. This is more of a procurement
issue than a runtime application issue.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
