<p>NAME ntp_clock - Reference Clock Options</p>

<p>REFERENCE CLOCK SUPPORT The NTP Version 4 daemon
supports some three dozen different radio, satellite and
modem reference clocks plus a special pseudo-clock used for
backup or when no other clock source is available. Detailed
descriptions of individual device drivers and options can be
found in the Reference Clock Drivers page. Additional
information can be found in the pages linked there,
including the Debugging Hints for Reference Clock Drivers
and How To Write a Reference Clock Driver pages. In addi-
tion, support for a PPS signal is available as described in
Pulse-per- second (PPS) Signal Interfacing page.</p>

<p>A reference clock will generally (though not always) be
a radio time- code receiver which is synchronized to a
source of standard time such as the services offered by the
NRC in Canada and NIST and USNO in the US. The interface
between the computer and the timecode receiver is device
dependent, but is usually a serial port. A device driver
spe- cific to each reference clock must be selected and
compiled in the dis- tribution; however, most common radio,
satellite and modem clocks are included by default. Note
that an attempt to configure a reference clock when the
driver has not been compiled or the hardware port has not
been appropriately configured results in a scalding remark
to the system log file, but is otherwise non hazardous.</p>

<p>For the purposes of configuration, ntpd treats reference
clocks in a manner analogous to normal NTP peers as much as
possible. Reference clocks are identified by a syntactically
correct but invalid IP address, in order to distinguish them
from normal NTP peers. Reference clock addresses are of the
form 127.127.t.u, where t is an integer denoting the clock
type and u indicates the unit number in the range 0-3. While
it may seem overkill, it is in fact sometimes useful to con-
figure multiple reference clocks of the same type, in which
case the unit numbers must be unique.</p>

<p>The server command is used to configure a reference
clock, where the address argument in that command is the
clock address. The key, version and ttl options are not used
for reference clock support. The mode option is added for
reference clock support, as described below. The prefer
option can be useful to persuade the server to cherish a
refer- ence clock with somewhat more enthusiasm than other
reference clocks or peers. Further information on this
option can be found in the Mitiga- tion Rules and the prefer
Keyword page. The minpoll and maxpoll options have meaning
only for selected clock drivers. See the individual clock
driver document pages for additional information.</p>

<p>The fudge command is used to provide additional
information for indi- vidual clock drivers and normally
follows immediately after the server command. The address
argument specifies the clock address. The refid and stratum
options control can be used to override the defaults for the
device. There are two optional device-dependent time offsets
and four flags that can be included in the fudge command as
well.</p>

<p>The stratum number of a reference clock is by default
zero. Since the ntpd daemon adds one to the stratum of each
peer, a primary server ordinarily displays an external
stratum of one. In order to provide engineered backups, it
is often useful to specify the reference clock stratum as
greater than zero. The stratum option is used for this pur-
pose. Also, in cases involving both a reference clock and a
pulse-per- second (PPS) discipline signal, it is useful to
specify the reference clock identifier as other than the
default, depending on the driver. The refid option is used
for this purpose. Except where noted, these options apply to
all clock drivers.</p>

<p>REFERENCE CLOCK COMMANDS server 127.127.t.u [prefer]
[mode int] [minpoll int] [maxpoll int] This command can be
used to configure reference clocks in spe- cial ways. The
options are interpreted as follows:</p>

<p>prefer Marks the reference clock as preferred. All other
things being equal, this host will be chosen for syn-
chronization among a set of correctly operating hosts. See
the Mitigation Rules and the prefer Keyword page for further
information.</p>

<p>mode int Specifies a mode number which is interpreted in
a device-specific fashion. For instance, it selects a
dialing protocol in the ACTS driver and a device sub- type
in the parse drivers.</p>

<p>minpoll int</p>

<p>maxpoll int These options specify the minimum and
maximum polling interval for reference clock messages in
seconds, interpreted as dual logarithms (2 ^ x). For most
directly connected reference clocks, both minpoll and
maxpoll default to 6 (2^16 = 64 s). For modem reference
clocks, minpoll defaults to 10 (2^10 = 1024 s = 17.1 m) and
maxpoll defaults to 14 (2^14 = 16384 s = 4.5 h). The
allowable range is 4 (16 s) to 17 (36.4 h) inclu- sive.</p>

<p>fudge 127.127.t.u [time1 sec] [time2 sec] [stratum int]
[refid string] [flag1 0|1] [flag2 0|1] [flag3 0|1] [flag4
0|1] This command can be used to configure reference clocks
in spe- cial ways. It must immediately follow the server
command which configures the driver. Note that the same
capability is possi- ble at run time using the ntpdc
program. The options are inter- preted as follows:</p>

<p>time1 sec Specifies a constant to be added to the time
offset produced by the driver, a fixed-point decimal number
in seconds. This is used as a calibration constant to adjust
the nominal time offset of a particular clock to agree with
an external standard, such as a precision PPS signal. It
also provides a way to correct a system- atic error or bias
due to serial port or operating sys- tem latencies,
different cable lengths or receiver internal delay. The
specified offset is in addition to the propagation delay
provided by other means, such as internal DIPswitches. Where
a calibration for an indi- vidual system and driver is
available, an approximate correction is noted in the driver
documentation pages. Note: in order to facilitate
calibration when more than one radio clock or PPS signal is
supported, a special calibration feature is available. It
takes the form of an argument to the enable command
described in the Mis- cellaneous Options page and operates
as described in the Reference Clock Drivers page.</p>

<p>time2 secs Specifies a fixed-point decimal number in
seconds, which is interpreted in a driver-dependent way. See
the descriptions of specific drivers in the reference clock
drivers page.</p>

<p>stratum int Specifies the stratum number assigned to the
driver, an integer between 0 and 15. This number overrides
the default stratum number ordinarily assigned by the driver
itself, usually zero.</p>

<p>refid string Specifies an ASCII string of from one to
four charac- ters which defines the reference identifier
used by the driver. This string overrides the default
identifier ordinarily assigned by the driver itself.</p>

<p>flag1 flag2 flag3 flag4 These four flags are used for
customizing the clock driver. The interpretation of these
values, and whether they are used at all, is a function of
the particular clock driver. However, by convention flag4 is
used to enable recording monitoring data to the clockstats
file configured with the filegen command. Further informa-
tion on the filegen command can be found in the Moni- toring
Options page.</p>
