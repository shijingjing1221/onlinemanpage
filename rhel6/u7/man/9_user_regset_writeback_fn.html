USER_REGSET_WRITEBAC(9)</p>

<p>NAME user_regset_writeback_fn - type of writeback
function in struct user_regset</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS typedef int user_regset_writeback_fn(struct
task_struct * target, const struct user_regset * regset, int
immediate);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS target thread being examined</p>

<p>regset regset being examined</p>

<p>immediate zero if writeback at completion of next
context switch is OK</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This call is optional; usually the pointer
is NULL. When provided, there is some user memory associated
with this regset&acute;s hardware, such as memory backing
cached register data on register window machines; the
regset&acute;s data controls what user memory is used (e.g.
via the stack pointer value).</p>

<p>Write register data back to user memory. If the
immediate flag is nonzero, it must be written to the user
memory so uaccess or access_process_vm can see it when this
call returns; if zero, then it must be written back by the
time the task completes a context switch (as synchronized
with wait_task_inactive). Return 0 on success or if there
was nothing to do, -EFAULT for a memory problem (bad stack
pointer or whatever), or -EIO for a hardware problem.</p>
