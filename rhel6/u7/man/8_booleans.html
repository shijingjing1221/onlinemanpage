<p>booleans(8) SELinux Command Line documentation
booleans(8)</p>

<p>NAME booleans - Policy booleans enable runtime
customization of SELinux pol- icy.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page describes SELinux policy
booleans.</p>

<p>The SELinux policy can include conditional rules that
are enabled or disabled based on the current values of a set
of policy booleans. These policy booleans allow runtime
modification of the security policy without having to load a
new policy.</p>

<p>For example, the boolean httpd_enable_cgi allows the
httpd daemon to run cgi scripts if it is enabled. If the
administrator does not want to allow execution of cgi
scripts, he can simply disable this boolean value.</p>

<p>The policy defines a default value for each boolean,
typically false. These default values can be overridden via
local settings created via the setsebool(8) utility, using
-P to make the setting persistent across reboots. The
system-config-securitylevel tool provides a graph- ical
interface for altering the settings. The load_policy(8)
program will preserve current boolean settings upon a policy
reload by default, or can optionally reset booleans to the
boot-time defaults via the -b option.</p>

<p>Boolean values can be listed by using the getsebool(8)
utility and passing it the -a option.</p>

<p>Boolean values can also be changed at runtime via the
setsebool(8) utility or the togglesebool utility. By
default, these utilities only change the current boolean
value and do not affect the persistent set- tings, unless
the -P option is used to setsebool.</p>
