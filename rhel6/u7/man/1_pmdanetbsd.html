<p>DESCRIPTION Each supported platform has a kernel
Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which extracts
performance metrics from the kernel of that plat- from. A
variety of platform-specific metrics are available, with an
equally varied set of access mechanisms - typically this
involves spe- cial system calls, or reading from files in
kernel virtual filesystems such as the Linux sysfs and
procfs filesystems.</p>

<p>The platform kernel PMDA is one of the most critical
components of the PCP installation, and must be as efficient
and reliable as possible. In all installations the default
kernel PMDA will be installed as a shared library and thus
executes directly within the pmcd(1) process. This slightly
reduces overheads associated with querying the metadata and
values associated with these metrics (no message passing is
required).</p>

<p>Unlike many other PMDAs, the kernel PMDA exports a
number of metric namespace subtrees, such as kernel,
network, swap, mem, ipc, filesys, nfs, disk and hinv
(hardware inventory).</p>

<p>Despite usually running as shared libraries, most
installations also include a stand-alone executable for the
kernel PMDA. This is to aid profiling and debugging
activities, with dbpmda(1) for example. In this case (but
not for shared libraries), the following command line
options are available:</p>

<p>-d It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics
domain num- ber specified here is unique and consistent.
That is, domain should be different for every PMDA on the
one host, and the same domain number should be used for the
same PMDA on all hosts.</p>

<p>-l Location of the log file. By default, a log file
named [plat- form].log is written in the current directory
of pmcd(1) when pmda[platform] is started, i.e.
$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd. If the log file cannot be created or is
not writable, output is written to the standard error
instead.</p>

<p>-U User account under which to run the agent. The
default is the unprivileged &quot;pcp&quot; account in
current versions of PCP, but in older versions the superuser
account (&quot;root&quot;) was used by default.</p>

<p>INSTALLATION Access to the names, help text and values
for the kernel performance metrics is available by default -
unlike most other agents, no action is required to enable
them and they should not be removed.</p>

<p>FILES $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/[platform]/help default help text
file for the the kernel metrics
$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/[platform].log default log file for error
messages and other information from the kernel PMDA.</p>

<p>PCP ENVIRONMENT Environment variables with the prefix
PCP_ are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP. On each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in pcp.conf(5).</p>
