<p>NAME error::pass5 - systemtap pass-5 errors</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Errors that occur during pass 5 (execution)
can have a variety of causes.</p>

<p>exceptional events during script execution The systemtap
translator and runtime include numerous error checks that
aim to protect the systems and the users from mis- takes or
transient conditions. The script may deliberately call the
error() tapset function to signal a problem. Some memory
needed for accessing $context variables may be temporarily
unavailable. Consider using the try/catch construct to wrap
script fragments in exception-handling code. Consider using
the stap --suppress-handler-errors or stap --skip-badvars
option.</p>

<p>resource exhaustion One of several types of space or
time resource limits may be exceeded by the script,
including system overload, too many tuples to be stored in
an array, etc. Some of the error mes- sages identify the
constraint by macro name, which may be indi- vidually
raised. Consider using the stap --suppress-handler- errors
option. Extend or disable resource limits using the stap
-DLIMIT=NNNN option.</p>

<p>remote execution server problems If you use the stap
--remote option to direct a systemtap script to be executed
somewhere else, ensure that an SSH connection may be made to
the remote host, and that it has the current system- tap
runtime installed &amp; available.</p>

<p>installation/permission problems It is possible that
your installation of systemtap was not cor- rectly
installed. For example, the /usr/bin/staprun program may
lack the necessary setuid permissions, or your invoking
userid might not have sufficient privileges (root, or
stapusr and related group memberships). Environment
variables may interfere with locating
/usr/libexec/.../stapio.</p>

<p>errors from target program The program invoked by the
stap -c CMD option may exit with a non-zero code.</p>

<p>uncaught exceptions in the target program When using
--runtime=dyninst you may encounter an issue where the
target program aborts with a message like &quot;terminate
called after throwing an instance of foo_exception&quot;.
This is unfor- tunately a limitation of Dyninst, which
sometimes prevents exceptions from properly unwinding
through instrumented code.</p>

<p>GATHERING MORE INFORMATION Increasing the verbosity of
pass-5 with an option such as --vp 00001 can help pinpoint
the problem.</p>
