<p>NAME lynx - a general purpose distributed information
browser for the World Wide Web</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS lynx [options] [path or URL]</p>

<p>use &quot;lynx -help&quot; to display a complete list of
current options.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Lynx is a fully-featured World Wide Web
(WWW) client for users running cursor-addressable,
character-cell display devices (e.g., vt100 terminals, vt100
emulators running on Windows 95/NT or Macintoshes, or any
other &quot;curses-oriented&quot; display). It will display
hypertext markup language (HTML) documents containing links
to files residing on the local system, as well as files
residing on remote systems running Gopher, HTTP, FTP, WAIS,
and NNTP servers. Current versions of Lynx run on Unix, VMS,
Windows 95/NT, 386DOS and OS/2 EMX.</p>

<p>Lynx can be used to access information on the World Wide
Web, or to build information systems intended primarily for
local access. For example, Lynx has been used to build
several Campus Wide Information Systems (CWIS). In addition,
Lynx can be used to build systems isolated within a single
LAN.</p>

<p>OPTIONS At start up, Lynx will load any local file or
remote URL specified at the command line. For help with
URLs, press &quot;?&quot; or &quot;H&quot; while running
Lynx. Then follow the link titled, &quot;Help on
URLs.&quot;</p>

<p>If more than one local file or remote URL is listed on
the command line, Lynx will open only the last
interactively. All of the names (local files and remote
URLs) are added to the G)oto history.</p>

<p>Lynx uses only long option names. Option names can begin
with double dash as well, underscores and dashes can be
intermixed in option names (in the reference below options
are with one dash before them and with underscores).</p>

<p>Lynx provides many command-line options. Some options
require a value (string, number or keyword). These are noted
in the reference below. The other options set boolean values
in the program. There are three types of boolean options:
set, unset and toggle. If no option value is given, these
have the obvious meaning: set (to true), unset (to false),
or toggle (between true/false). For any of these, an
explicit value can be given in different forms to allow for
operating system constraints, e.g., -center:off -center=off
-center- Lynx recognizes &quot;1&quot;, &quot;+&quot;,
&quot;on&quot; and &quot;true&quot; for true values, and
&quot;0&quot;, &quot;-&quot;, &quot;off&quot; and
&quot;false&quot; for false values. Other option-values are
ignored.</p>

<p>The default boolean, number and string option values
that are compiled into lynx are displayed in the
help-message provided by lynx -help. Some of those may
differ according to how lynx was built; see the help message
itself for these values. The -help option is processed
before any option, including those that control reading from
the lynx.cfg file. Therefore runtime configuration values
are not reflected in the help-message.</p>

<p>- If the argument is only -, then Lynx expects to
receive the arguments from the standard input. This is to
allow for the potentially very long command line that can be
associated with the -get_data or -post_data arguments (see
below). It can also be used to avoid having sensitive
information in the invoking command line (which would be
visible to other processes on most systems), especially when
the -auth or -pauth options are used.</p>

<p>-accept_all_cookies accept all cookies.</p>

<p>-anonymous apply restrictions for anonymous account, see
also -restrictions.</p>

<p>-assume_charset=MIMEname charset for documents that dont
specify it.</p>

<p>-assume_local_charset=MIMEname charset assumed for local
files, i.e., files which lynx creates such as internal pages
for the options menu.</p>

<p>-assume_unrec_charset=MIMEname use this instead of
unrecognized charsets.</p>

<p>-auth=ID:PASSWD set authorization ID and password for
protected documents at startup. Be sure to protect any
script files which use this switch.</p>

<p>-base prepend a request URL comment and BASE tag to
text/html outputs for -source dumps.</p>

<p>-bibp=URL specify a local bibp server (default
http://bibhost/).</p>

<p>-blink forces high intensity background colors for color
mode, if available and supported by the terminal. This
applies to the slang library (for a few terminal emulators),
or to OS/2 EMX with ncurses.</p>

<p>-book use the bookmark page as the startfile. The
default or command line startfile is still set for the Main
screen command, and will be used if the bookmark page is
unavailable or blank.</p>

<p>-buried_news toggles scanning of news articles for
buried references, and converts them to news links. Not
recommended because email addresses enclosed in angle
brackets will be converted to false news links, and
uuencoded messages can be trashed.</p>

<p>-cache=NUMBER set the NUMBER of documents cached in
memory. The default is 10.</p>

<p>-case enable case-sensitive string searching.</p>

<p>-center Toggle center alignment in HTML TABLE.</p>

<p>-cfg=FILENAME specifies a Lynx configuration file other
than the default lynx.cfg.</p>

<p>-child exit on left-arrow in startfile, and disable save
to disk.</p>

<p>-cmd_log=FILENAME write keystroke commands and related
information to the specified file.</p>

<p>-cmd_script=FILENAME read keystroke commands from the
specified file. You can use the data written using the
-cmd_log option. Lynx will ignore other information which
the command-logging may have written to the logfile. Each
line of the command script contains either a comment
beginning with &quot;#&quot;, or a keyword:</p>

<p>exit causes the script to stop, and forces Lynx to exit
immediately.</p>

<p>key the character value, in printable form. Cursor and
other special keys are given as names, e.g., &quot;Down
Arrow&quot;. Printable 7-bit ASCII codes are given as-is,
and hexadecimal values represent other 8-bit codes.</p>

<p>set followed by a &quot;name=value&quot; allows one to
override values set in the lynx.cfg file.</p>

<p>-color forces color mode on, if available. Default color
control sequences which work for many terminal types are
assumed if the terminal capability description does not
specify how to handle color. Lynx needs to be compiled with
the slang library for this flag, it is equivalent to setting
the COLORTERM environment variable. (If color support is
instead provided by a color- capable curses library like
ncurses, Lynx relies completely on the terminal description
to determine whether color mode is possible, and this flag
is not needed and thus unavailable.) A saved
show_color=always setting found in a .lynxrc file at startup
has the same effect. A saved show_color=never found in
.lynxrc on startup is overridden by this flag.</p>

<p>-connect_timeout=N Sets the connection timeout, where N
is given in seconds.</p>

<p>-cookie_file=FILENAME specifies a file to use to read
cookies. If none is specified, the default value is
~/.lynx_cookies for most systems, but ~/cookies for
MS-DOS.</p>

<p>-cookie_save_file=FILENAME specifies a file to use to
store cookies. If none is specified, the value given by
-cookie_file is used.</p>

<p>-cookies toggles handling of Set-Cookie headers.</p>

<p>-core toggles forced core dumps on fatal errors. Turn
this option off to ask Lynx to force a core dump if a fatal
error occurs.</p>

<p>-crawl with -traversal, output each page to a file. with
-dump, format output as with -traversal, but to the standard
output.</p>

<p>-curses_pads toggles the use of curses &quot;pad&quot;
feature which supports left/right scrolling of the
display.</p>

<p>-debug_partial separate incremental display stages with
MessageSecs delay</p>

<p>-delay add DebugSecs delay after each
progress-message</p>

<p>-display=DISPLAY set the display variable for X rexec-ed
programs.</p>

<p>-display_charset=MIMEname set the charset for the
terminal output.</p>

<p>-dont_wrap_pre inhibit wrapping of text in &lt;pre&gt;
when -dumping and -crawling, mark wrapped lines in
interactive session.</p>

<p>-dump dumps the formatted output of the default document
or those specified on the command line to standard output.
Unlike interactive mode, all documents are processed. This
can be used in the following way:</p>

<p>lynx -dump http://www.subir.com/lynx.html</p>

<p>-editor=EDITOR enable external editing, using the
specified EDITOR. (vi, ed, emacs, etc.)</p>

<p>-find_leaks toggle memory leak-checking. Normally this
is not compiled-into your executable, but when it is, it can
be disabled for a session.</p>

<p>-force_empty_hrefless_a force HREF-less A elements to be
empty (close them as soon as they are seen).</p>

<p>-hiddenlinks=[option] control the display of hidden
links.</p>

<p>merge hidden links show up as bracketed numbers and are
numbered together with other links in the sequence of their
occurrence in the document.</p>

<p>listonly hidden links are shown only on L)ist screens
and listings generated by -dump or from the P)rint menu, but
appear separately at the end of those lists. This is the
default behavior.</p>

<p>ignore hidden links do not appear even in listings.</p>

of forms with method POST when the documents they returned
are sought with the PREV_DOC command or from the History
List.</p>

<p>-rlogin disable recognition of rlogin commands.</p>

<p>-scrollbar toggles showing scrollbar.</p>

<p>-scrollbar_arrow toggles showing arrows at ends of the
scrollbar.</p>

<p>-selective require .www_browsable files to browse
directories.</p>

<p>-short_url show very long URLs in the status line with
&quot;...&quot; to represent the portion which cannot be
displayed. The beginning and end of the URL are displayed,
rather than suppressing the end.</p>

<p>-show_cursor If enabled the cursor will not be hidden in
the right hand corner but will instead be positioned at the
start of the currently selected link. Show cursor is the
default for systems without FANCY_CURSES capabilities. The
default configuration can be changed in userdefs.h or
lynx.cfg. The command line switch toggles the default.</p>

<p>-show_rate If enabled the transfer rate is shown in
bytes/second. If disabled, no transfer rate is shown. Use
lynx.cfg or the options menu to select KB/second and/or
ETA.</p>

<p>-soft_dquotes toggles emulation of the old Netscape and
Mosaic bug which treated &gt; as a co-terminator for
double-quotes and tags.</p>

<p>-source works the same as dump but outputs HTML source
instead of formatted text. For example</p>

<p>lynx -source . &gt;foo.html</p>

<p>generates HTML source listing the files in the current
directory. Each file is marked by an HREF relative to the
parent directory. Add a trailing slash to make the HREFs
relative to the current directory:</p>

<p>lynx -source ./ &gt;foo.html</p>

<p>-stack_dump disable SIGINT cleanup handler</p>

<p>-startfile_ok allow non-http startfile and homepage with
-validate.</p>

<p>-stderr When dumping a document using -dump or -source,
Lynx normally does not display alert (error) messages that
you see on the screen in the status line. Use the -stderr
option to tell Lynx to write these messages to the standard
error.</p>

<p>-stdin read the startfile from standard input (UNIX
only).</p>

<p>-syslog=text information for syslog call.</p>

<p>-syslog-urls log requested URLs with syslog.</p>

<p>-tagsoup initialize parser, using Tag Soup DTD rather
than SortaSGML.</p>

<p>-telnet disable recognition of telnet commands.</p>

<p>-term=TERM tell Lynx what terminal type to assume it is
talking to. (This may be useful for remote execution, when,
for example, Lynx connects to a remote TCP/IP port that
starts a script that, in turn, starts another Lynx
process.)</p>

<p>-timeout=N For win32, sets the network read-timeout,
where N is given in seconds.</p>

<p>-tlog toggles between using a Lynx Trace Log and stderr
for trace output from the session.</p>

<p>-tna turns on &quot;Textfields Need Activation&quot;
mode.</p>

<p>-trace turns on Lynx trace mode. Destination of trace
output depends on -tlog.</p>

<p>-trace_mask=value turn on optional traces, which may
result in very large trace files. Logically OR the values to
combine options: 1=SGML character parsing states
2=color-style 4=TRST (table layout) 8=config (lynx.cfg and
.lynxrc contents) 16=binary string copy/append, used in form
data construction.</p>

<p>-traversal traverse all http links derived from
startfile. When used with -crawl, each link that begins with
the same string as startfile is output to a file, intended
for indexing. See CRAWL.announce for more information.</p>

<p>trim_input_fields trim input text/textarea fields in
forms.</p>

<p>-underline_links toggles use of underline/bold attribute
for links.</p>

<p>-underscore toggles use of _underline_ format in
dumps.</p>

<p>-use_mouse turn on mouse support, if available. Clicking
the left mouse button on a link traverses it. Clicking the
right mouse button pops back. Click on the top line to
scroll up. Click on the bottom line to scroll down. The
first few positions in the top and bottom line may invoke
additional functions. Lynx must be compiled with ncurses or
slang to support this feature. If ncurses is used, clicking
the middle mouse button pops up a simple menu. Mouse clicks
may only work reliably while Lynx is idle waiting for
input.</p>

<p>-useragent=Name set alternate Lynx User-Agent
header.</p>

<p>-validate accept only http URLs (for validation).
Complete security restrictions also are implemented.</p>

<p>-verbose toggle [LINK], [IMAGE] and [INLINE] comments
with filenames of these images.</p>

<p>-version print version information.</p>

<p>-vikeys enable vi-like key movement.</p>

<p>-wdebug enable Waterloo tcp/ip packet debug (print to
watt debugfile). This applies only to DOS versions compiled
with WATTCP or WATT-32.</p>

<p>-width=NUMBER number of columns for formatting of dumps,
default is 80.</p>

<p>-with_backspaces emit backspaces in output if -dumping
or -crawling (like man does)</p>

<p>COMMANDS o Use Up arrow and Down arrow to scroll through
hypertext links.</p>

<p>o Right arrow or Return will follow a highlighted
hypertext link.</p>

<p>o Left Arrow will retreat from a link.</p>

<p>o Type &quot;H&quot; or &quot;?&quot; for online help
and descriptions of key-stroke commands.</p>

<p>o Type &quot;K&quot; for a complete list of the current
key-stroke command mappings.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT In addition to various &quot;standard&quot;
environment variables such as HOME, PATH, USER, DISPLAY,
TMPDIR, etc, Lynx utilizes several Lynx-specific environment
variables, if they exist.</p>

<p>Others may be created or modified by Lynx to pass data
to an external program, or for other reasons. These are
listed separately below.</p>

<p>See also the sections on SIMULATED CGI SUPPORT and
NATIVE LANGUAGE SUPPORT, below.</p>

<p>Note: Not all environment variables apply to all types
of platforms supported by Lynx, though most do. Feedback on
platform dependencies is solicited.</p>

<p>Environment Variables Used By Lynx:</p>

<p>COLORTERM If set, color capability for the terminal is
forced on at startup time. The actual value assigned to the
variable is ignored. This variable is only meaningful if
Lynx was built using the slang screen-handling library.</p>

<p>LYNX_CFG This variable, if set, will override the
default location and name of the global configuration file
(normally, lynx.cfg) that was defined by the LYNX_CFG_FILE
constant in the userdefs.h file, during installation. See
the userdefs.h file for more information.</p>

<p>LYNX_LOCALEDIR If set, this variable overrides the
compiled-in location of the locale directory which contains
native language (NLS) message text.</p>

<p>LYNX_LSS This variable, if set, specifies the location
of the default Lynx character style sheet file. [Currently
only meaningful if Lynx was built using experimental color
style support.]</p>

<p>LYNX_SAVE_SPACE This variable, if set, will override the
default path prefix for files saved to disk that is defined
in the lynx.cfg SAVE_SPACE: statement. See the lynx.cfg file
for more information.</p>

<p>LYNX_TEMP_SPACE This variable, if set, will override the
default path prefix for temporary files that was defined
during installation, as well as any value that may be
assigned to the TMPDIR variable.</p>

<p>MAIL This variable specifies the default inbox Lynx will
check for new mail, if such checking is enabled in the
lynx.cfg file.</p>

<p>NEWS_ORGANIZATION This variable, if set, provides the
string used in the Organization: header of USENET news
postings. It will override the setting of the ORGANIZATION
environment variable, if it is also set (and, on UNIX, the
contents of an /etc/organization file, if present).</p>

<p>NNTPSERVER If set, this variable specifies the default
NNTP server that will be used for USENET news reading and
posting with Lynx, via news: URLs.</p>

<p>ORGANIZATION This variable, if set, provides the string
used in the Organization: header of USENET news postings. On
UNIX, it will override the contents of an /etc/organization
file, if present.</p>

<p>PROTOCOL_proxy Lynx supports the use of proxy servers
that can act as firewall gateways and caching servers. They
are preferable to the older gateway servers (see
WWW_access_GATEWAY, below). Each protocol used by Lynx,
(http, ftp, gopher, etc), can be mapped separately by
setting environment variables of the form PROTOCOL_proxy
(literally: http_proxy, ftp_proxy, gopher_proxy, etc), to
&quot;http://some.server.dom:port/&quot;. See Lynx Users
Guide for additional details and examples.</p>

<p>SSL_CERT_DIR Set to the directory containing trusted
certificates.</p>

<p>SSL_CERT_FILE Set to the full path and filename for your
file of trusted certificates.</p>

<p>WWW_access_GATEWAY Lynx still supports use of gateway
servers, with the servers specified via
&quot;WWW_access_GATEWAY&quot; variables (where
&quot;access&quot; is lower case and can be
&quot;http&quot;, &quot;ftp&quot;, &quot;gopher&quot; or
&quot;wais&quot;), however most gateway servers have been
discontinued. Note that you do not include a terminal / for
gateways, but do for proxies specified by PROTOCOL_proxy
environment variables. See Lynx Users Guide for details.</p>

<p>WWW_HOME This variable, if set, will override the
default startup URL specified in any of the Lynx
configuration files.</p>

<p>Environment Variables Set or Modified By Lynx:</p>

<p>LYNX_PRINT_DATE This variable is set by the Lynx p(rint)
function, to the Date: string seen in the documents
&quot;Information about&quot; page (= cmd), if any. It is
created for use by an external program, as defined in a
lynx.cfg PRINTER: definition statement. If the field does
not exist for the document, the variable is set to a null
string under UNIX, or &quot;No Date&quot; under VMS.</p>

<p>LYNX_PRINT_LASTMOD This variable is set by the Lynx
p(rint) function, to the Last Mod: string seen in the
documents &quot;Information about&quot; page (= cmd), if
any. It is created for use by an external program, as
defined in a lynx.cfg PRINTER: definition statement. If the
field does not exist for the document, the variable is set
to a null string under UNIX, or &quot;No LastMod&quot; under
VMS.</p>

<p>LYNX_PRINT_TITLE This variable is set by the Lynx
p(rint) function, to the Linkname: string seen in the
documents &quot;Information about&quot; page (= cmd), if
any. It is created for use by an external program, as
defined in a lynx.cfg PRINTER: definition statement. If the
field does not exist for the document, the variable is set
to a null string under UNIX, or &quot;No Title&quot; under
VMS.</p>

<p>LYNX_PRINT_URL This variable is set by the Lynx p(rint)
function, to the URL: string seen in the documents
&quot;Information about&quot; page (= cmd), if any. It is
created for use by an external program, as defined in a
lynx.cfg PRINTER: definition statement. If the field does
not exist for the document, the variable is set to a null
string under UNIX, or &quot;No URL&quot; under VMS.</p>

<p>LYNX_TRACE If set, causes Lynx to write a trace file as
if the -trace option were supplied.</p>

<p>LYNX_TRACE_FILE If set, overrides the compiled-in name
of the trace file, which is either Lynx.trace or
LY-TRACE.LOG (the latter on the DOS platform). The trace
file is in either case relative to the home directory.</p>

<p>LYNX_VERSION This variable is always set by Lynx, and
may be used by an external program to determine if it was
invoked by Lynx. See also the comments in the distribution s
sample mailcap file, for notes on usage in such a file.</p>

<p>TERM Normally, this variable is used by Lynx to
determine the terminal type being used to invoke Lynx. If,
however, it is unset at startup time (or has the value
&quot;unknown&quot;), or if the -term command- line option
is used (see OPTIONS section above), Lynx will set or modify
its value to the user specified terminal type (for the Lynx
execution environment). Note: If set/modified by Lynx, the
values of the LINES and/or COLUMNS environment variables may
also be changed.</p>

<p>SIMULATED CGI SUPPORT If built with the cgi-links option
enabled, Lynx allows access to a cgi script directly without
the need for an http daemon.</p>

<p>When executing such &quot;lynxcgi scripts&quot; (if
enabled), the following variables may be set for simulating
a CGI environment:</p>

<p>CONTENT_LENGTH</p>

<p>CONTENT_TYPE</p>

<p>DOCUMENT_ROOT</p>

<p>HTTP_ACCEPT_CHARSET</p>

<p>HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE</p>

<p>HTTP_USER_AGENT</p>

<p>PATH_INFO</p>

<p>PATH_TRANSLATED</p>

<p>QUERY_STRING</p>

<p>REMOTE_ADDR</p>

<p>REMOTE_HOST</p>

<p>REQUEST_METHOD</p>

<p>SERVER_SOFTWARE</p>

<p>Other environment variables are not inherited by the
script, unless they are provided via a LYNXCGI_ENVIRONMENT
statement in the configuration file. See the lynx.cfg file,
and the (draft) CGI 1.1 Specification
&lt;http://Web.Golux.Com/coar/cgi/draft-coar-cgi-v11-00.txt&gt;
for the definition and usage of these variables.</p>

<p>The CGI Specification, and other associated
documentation, should be consulted for general information
on CGI script programming.</p>

<p>NATIVE LANGUAGE SUPPORT If configured and installed with
Native Language Support, Lynx will display status and other
messages in your local language. See the file ABOUT_NLS in
the source distribution, or at your local GNU site, for more
information about internationalization.</p>

<p>The following environment variables may be used to alter
default settings:</p>

<p>LANG This variable, if set, will override the default
message language. It is an ISO 639 two-letter code
identifying the language. Language codes are NOT the same as
the country codes given in ISO 3166.</p>

<p>LANGUAGE This variable, if set, will override the
default message language. This is a GNU extension that has
higher priority for setting the message catalog than LANG or
LC_ALL.</p>

<p>LC_ALL and</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES These variables, if set, specify the notion
of native language formatting style. They are POSIXly
correct.</p>

<p>LINGUAS This variable, if set prior to configuration,
limits the installed languages to specific values. It is a
space-separated list of two-letter codes. Currently, it is
hard-coded to a wish list.</p>

<p>NLSPATH This variable, if set, is used as the path
prefix for message catalogs.</p>

<p>Note that man page availability and section numbering is
somewhat plat- form dependent, and may vary from the above
references.</p>

<p>A section shown as (GNU), is intended to denote that the
topic may be available via an info page, instead of a man
page (i.e., try &quot;info sub- ject&quot;, rather than
&quot;man subject&quot;).</p>

<p>A section shown as (?) denotes that documentation on the
topic exists, but is not part of an established
documentation retrieval system (see the distribution files
associated with the topic, or contact your Sys- tem
Administrator for further information).</p>

<p>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Lynx has incorporated code from a
variety of sources along the way. The earliest versions of
Lynx included code from Earl Fogel of Comput- ing Services
at the University of Saskatchewan, who implemented HYPER-
REZ in the Unix environment. HYPERREZ was developed by Niel
Larson of Think.com and served as the model for the early
versions of Lynx. Those versions also incorporated libraries
from the Unix Gopher clients developed at the University of
Minnesota, and the later versions of Lynx rely on the WWW
client library code developed by Tim Berners-Lee and the WWW
community. Also a special thanks to Foteos Macrides who
ported much of Lynx to VMS and did or organized most of its
development since the departures of Lou Montulli and Garrett
Blythe from the Uni- versity of Kansas in the summer of 1994
through the release of v2.7.2, and to everyone on the net
who has contributed to Lynxs development either directly
(through patches, comments or bug reports) or indirect- ly
(through inspiration and development of other systems).</p>
