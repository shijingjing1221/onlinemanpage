<p>NAME rsocket - RDMA socket API</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;rdma/rsocket.h&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION RDMA socket API and protocol</p>

<p>NOTES Rsockets is a protocol over RDMA that supports a
socket-level API for applications. Rsocket APIs are intended
to match the behavior of cor- responding socket calls,
except where noted. Rsocket functions match the name and
function signature of socket calls, with the exception that
all function calls are prefixed with an r.</p>

<p>The following functions are defined:</p>

<p>rsocket</p>

<p>rbind, rlisten, raccept, rconnect</p>

<p>rshutdown, rclose</p>

<p>rrecv, rrecvfrom, rrecvmsg, rread, rreadv</p>

<p>rsend, rsendto, rsendmsg, rwrite, rwritev</p>

<p>rpoll, rselect</p>

<p>rgetpeername, rgetsockname</p>

<p>rsetsockopt, rgetsockopt, rfcntl</p>

<p>Functions take the same parameters as that used for
sockets. The fol- low capabilities and flags are supported
at this time:</p>

<p>PF_INET, PF_INET6, SOCK_STREAM, SOCK_DGRAM</p>

<p>SOL_SOCKET - SO_ERROR, SO_KEEPALIVE (flag supported, but
ignored), SO_LINGER, SO_OOBINLINE, SO_RCVBUF, SO_REUSEADDR,
SO_SNDBUF</p>

<p>IPPROTO_TCP - TCP_NODELAY, TCP_MAXSEG</p>

<p>IPPROTO_IPV6 - IPV6_V6ONLY</p>

<p>MSG_DONTWAIT, MSG_PEEK, O_NONBLOCK</p>

<p>Rsockets provides extensions beyond normal socket
routines that allow for direct placement of data into an
application s buffer. This is also known as zero-copy
support, since data is sent and received directly, bypassing
copies into network controlled buffers. The fol- lowing
calls and options support direct data placement.</p>

<p>riomap, riounmap, riowrite</p>

<p>off_t riomap(int socket, void *buf, size_t len, int
prot, int flags, off_t offset)</p>

<p>Riomap registers an application buffer with the RDMA
hardware associated with an rsocket. The buffer is
registered either for local only access (PROT_NONE) or for
remote write access (PROT_WRITE). When registered for remote
access, the buffer is mapped to a given offset. The offset
is either provided by the user, or if the user selects -1
for the offset, rsockets selects one. The remote peer may
access an iomapped buffer directly by specifying the correct
offset. The mapping is not guaranteed to be available until
after the remote peer receives a data trans- fer initiated
after riomap has completed.</p>

<p>In order to enable the use of remote IO mapping calls on
an rsocket, an application must set the number of IO
mappings that are available to the remote peer. This may be
done using the rsetsockopt RDMA_IOMAPSIZE option. By
default, an rsocket does not support remote IO mappings.
riounmap</p>

<p>int riounmap(int socket, void *buf, size_t len)</p>

<p>Riounmap removes the mapping between a buffer and an
rsocket.</p>

<p>riowrite</p>

<p>size_t riowrite(int socket, const void *buf, size_t
count, off_t off- set, int flags)</p>

<p>Riowrite allows an application to transfer data over an
rsocket directly into a remotely iomapped buffer. The remote
buffer is specified through an offset parameter, which
corresponds to a remote iomapped buffer. From the sender s
perspective, riowrite behaves similar to rwrite. From a
receivers view, riowrite transfers are silently redirected
into a pre- determined data buffer. Data is received
automatically, and the receiver is not informed of the
transfer. However, iowrite data is still con- sidered part
of the data stream, such that iowrite data will be written
before a subsequent transfer is received. A message sent
immediately after initiating an iowrite may be used to
notify the receiver of the iowrite.</p>

<p>In addition to standard socket options, rsockets
supports options spe- cific to RDMA devices and protocols.
These options are accessible through rsetsockopt using
SOL_RDMA option level.</p>

<p>RDMA_SQSIZE - Integer size of the underlying send
queue.</p>

<p>RDMA_RQSIZE - Integer size of the underlying receive
queue.</p>

<p>RDMA_INLINE - Integer size of inline data.</p>

<p>RDMA_IOMAPSIZE - Integer number of remote IO mappings
supported</p>

<p>RDMA_ROUTE - struct ibv_path_data of path record for
connection.</p>

<p>Note that rsockets fds cannot be passed into non-rsocket
calls. For applications which must mix rsocket fd s with
standard socket fds or opened files, rpoll and rselect
support polling both rsockets and nor- mal fds.</p>

<p>Existing applications can make use of rsockets through
the use of a preload library. Because rsockets implements an
end-to-end protocol, both sides of a connection must use
rsockets. The rdma_cm library pro- vides such a preload
library, librspreload. To reduce the chance of the preload
library intercepting calls without the users explicit
knowledge, the librspreload library is installed into
%libdir%/rsocket subdirectory.</p>

<p>The preload library can be used by setting LD_PRELOAD
when running. Note that not all applications will work with
rsockets. Support is limited based on the socket options
used by the application. Support for fork() is limited, but
available. To use rsockets with the preload library for
applications that call fork, users must set the environment
variable RDMAV_FORK_SAFE=1 on both the client and server
side of the connection. In general, fork is supportable for
server applications that accept a connection, then fork off
a process to handle the new connection.</p>

<p>rsockets uses configuration files that give an
administrator control over the default settings used by
rsockets. Use files under %syscon- fig%/rdma/rsocket as
shown:</p>

<p>mem_default - default size of receive buffer(s)</p>

<p>wmem_default - default size of send buffer(s)</p>

<p>sqsize_default - default size of send queue</p>

<p>rqsize_default - default size of receive queue</p>

<p>inline_default - default size of inline data</p>

<p>iomap_size - default size of remote iomapping table</p>

<p>polling_time - default number of microseconds to poll
for data before waiting</p>

<p>All configuration files should contain a single integer
value. Values may be set by issuing a command similar to the
following example.</p>

<p>echo 1000000 &gt; /etc/rdma/rsocket/mem_default</p>

<p>If configuration files are not available, rsockets uses
internal defaults. Applications can override default values
programmatically through the rsetsockopt routine.</p>
