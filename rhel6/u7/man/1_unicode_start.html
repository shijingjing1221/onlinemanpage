<p>UNICODE_START(1) UNICODE_START(1)</p>

<p>NAME unicode_start - put keyboard and console in unicode
mode</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS unicode_start [font [umap]]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The unicode_start command will put the
keyboard and console into Uni- code (UTF-8) mode.</p>

<p>For the keyboard this means that one can attach 16-bit
U+xxxx values to keyboard keys using loadkeys(1), and have
these appear as UTF-8 input to user programs. Also, that one
can type hexadecimal Alt-xxxx using the numeric keypad, and
again produce UTF-8.</p>

<p>For the console this means that the kernel expects UTF-8
output from user programs, and displays the output
accordingly.</p>

<p>The parameter font is a font that is loaded. It should
have a built-in Unicode map, or, if it hasnt, such a map can
be given explicitly as second parameter. When no font was
specified, the current font is kept.</p>

<p>NOTE Unicode mode is a parameter with a value per
virtual console. However, usually the font and keymap is
common to all consoles.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO dumpkeys(1), kbd_mode(1), loadkeys(1),
unicode_stop(1), utf-8(7), set- font(8)</p>
