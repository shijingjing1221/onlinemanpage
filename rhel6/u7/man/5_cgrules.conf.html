<p>CGRULES.CONF(5) libcgroup Manual CGRULES.CONF(5)</p>

<p>NAME cgrules.conf - libcgroup configuration file</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION cgrules.conf configuration file is used by
libcgroups to define control groups to which a process
belongs.</p>

<p>The file contains a list of rules which assign to a
defined group/user a control group in a subsystem (or
control groups in subsystems).</p>

<p>Rules have two formats:</p>

<p>&lt;user&gt; &lt;controllers&gt; &lt;destination&gt;
&lt;user&gt;:&lt;process name&gt; &lt;controllers&gt;
&lt;destination&gt;</p>

<p>Where:</p>

<p>user can be: - a user name - a group name with @group
syntax - the wildcard *, for any user or group - %, which is
equivalent to &quot;ditto&quot; (useful for multi-line rules
where different cgroups need to be specified for various
hierarchies for a single user)</p>

<p>process name is optional and it can be: - a process name
- a full command path of a process</p>

<p>controllers can be: - comma separated controller names
(no spaces) or - * (for all mounted controllers)</p>

<p>destination can be: - path relative to the controller
hierarchy (ex. pgrp1/gid1/uid1) - following strings called
&quot;templates&quot; and will get expanded</p>

<p>%u username, uid if name resolving fails %U uid %g group
name, gid if name resolving fails %G gid %p process name,
pid if name not available %P pid</p>

<p>can be used to escape % First rule which matches the
criteria will be executed.</p>

<p>Any text starting with # is considered as a start of
comment line and is ignored.</p>

<p>If the destination contains template string, the control
group can be created on-fly. In time when some process wants
to use the template rule which leads to control group (see
cgexec (1)) and the control group does not exist, the group
is created. The template control group parameters can be
specified in cgconfig.conf configuration file. See
(cgconfig.conf (5)). If the template definition is not found
there created group have default kernel setting.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES student devices /usergroup/students Student s
processes in the devices subsystem belong to the control
group /usergroup/students.</p>

<p>student:cp devices /usergroup/students/cp When student
executes cp command, the processes in the devices sub-
system belong to the control group
/usergroup/students/cp.</p>

<p>@admin * admingroup/ Processes started by anybody from
admin group no matter in what subsys- tem belong to the
control group admingroup/.</p>

<p>peter cpu test1/ % memory test2/ The first line says
Peter s task for cpu controller belongs to test1 control
group. The second one says Peters tasks for memory
controller belong to test2/ control group.</p>

<p>* * default/ All processes in any subsystem belong to
the control group default/. Since the earliest matched rule
is applied, it makes sense to have this line at the end of
the list. It will put a task which was not mentioned in the
previous rules to default/ control group.</p>

<p>@students cpu,cpuacct students/%u Processes in cpu and
cpuacct subsystems started by anybody from stu- dents group
belong to group students/name. Where &quot;name&quot; is
user name of owner of the process.</p>
