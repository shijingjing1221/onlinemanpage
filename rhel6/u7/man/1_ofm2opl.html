Metrics file, OFMNAME, into a human-readable property-list
form. The program writes to standard out- put (by default)
or to a file specified as OPLFILE.</p>

<p>The program also works with TeX TFM files, producing TeX
PL files. (ofm2opl is based on the WEB source code for
tftopl(1).)</p>

according to TYPE, which can be either hex or ascii. Default
is hex. ascii specifes all ASCII letters and digits; hex
gets you everything else.</p>

<p>AUTHOR According to the WEB documentation:</p>

<p>The first TFtoPL program was designed by Leo Guibas in
the sum- mer of 1978. Contributions by Frank Liang, Doug
Wyatt, and Lyle Ramshaw also had a significant effect on the
evolution of the present code.</p>

<p>Extensions for an enhanced ligature mechanism were added
by D.E. Knuth in 1989.</p>

<p>Extensions to handle extended font metric files ( OFM)
were added by John Plaice in December 1995 and January 1996,
result- ing in the new program OFM2OPL.</p>

<p>The primary authors of Omega are John Plaice
