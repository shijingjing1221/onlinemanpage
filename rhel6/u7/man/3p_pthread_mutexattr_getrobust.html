<p>PTHREAD_MUTEXATTR_GETROBUSTPOSIX Programmer s
MPTHREAD_MUTEXATTR_GETROBUST(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME pthread_mutexattr_getrobust,
pthread_mutexattr_setrobust get and set the mutex robust
attribute</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;</p>

<p>int pthread_mutexattr_getrobust(const
pthread_mutexattr_t *restrict attr, int *restrict robust);
int pthread_mutexattr_setrobust(pthread_mutexattr_t *attr,
int robust);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pthread_mutexattr_getrobust() and
pthread_mutexattr_setrobust() functions, respectively, shall
get and set the mutex robust attribute. This attribute is
set in the robust parameter. Valid values for robust
include:</p>

<p>PTHREAD_MUTEX_STALLED No special actions are taken if
the owner of the mutex is termi- nated while holding the
mutex lock. This can lead to deadlocks if no other thread
can unlock the mutex. This is the default value.</p>

<p>PTHREAD_MUTEX_ROBUST If the process containing the
owning thread of a robust mutex terminates while holding the
mutex lock, the next thread that acquires the mutex shall be
notified about the termination by the return value
[EOWNERDEAD] from the locking function. If the own- ing
thread of a robust mutex terminates while holding the mutex
lock, the next thread that acquires the mutex may be
notified about the termination by the return value
[EOWNERDEAD]. The notified thread can then attempt to mark
the state protected by the mutex as consistent again by a
call to pthread_mutex_consis- tent(). After a subsequent
successful call to pthread_mutex_unlock(), the mutex lock
shall be released and can be used normally by other threads.
If the mutex is unlocked with- out a call to
pthread_mutex_consistent(), it shall be in a perma- nently
unusable state and all attempts to lock the mutex shall fail
with the error [ENOTRECOVERABLE]. The only permissible
operation on such a mutex is pthread_mutex_destroy().</p>

<p>The behavior is undefined if the value specified by the
attr argument to pthread_mutexattr_getrobust() or
pthread_mutexattr_setrobust() does not refer to an
initialized mutex attributes object.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, the
pthread_mutexattr_getrobust() function shall return zero and
store the value of the robust attribute of attr into the
object referenced by the robust parameter. Otherwise, an
error value shall be returned to indicate the error. If
successful, the pthread_mutexattr_setrobust() function shall
return zero; otherwise, an error number shall be returned to
indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The pthread_mutexattr_setrobust() function shall
fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The value of robust is invalid.</p>

<p>These functions shall not return an error code of
[EINTR].</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The actions required to make the state
protected by the mutex consis- tent again are solely
dependent on the application. If it is not possi- ble to
make the state of a mutex consistent, robust mutexes can be
used to notify this situation by calling
pthread_mutex_unlock() without a prior call to
pthread_mutex_consistent().</p>

<p>If the state is declared inconsistent by calling
pthread_mutex_unlock() without a prior call to
pthread_mutex_consistent(), a possible approach could be to
destroy the mutex and then reinitialize it. However, it
should be noted that this is possible only in certain
situations where the state protected by the mutex has to be
reinitialized and coordina- tion achieved with other threads
blocked on the mutex, because other- wise a call to a
locking function with a reference to a mutex object
invalidated by a call to pthread_mutex_destroy() results in
undefined behavior.</p>

<p>RATIONALE If an implementation detects that the value
specified by the attr argu- ment to
pthread_mutexattr_getrobust() or
pthread_mutexattr_setrobust() does not refer to an
initialized mutex attributes object, it is recom- mended
that the function should fail and report an [EINVAL]
error.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
