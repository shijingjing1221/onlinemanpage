<p>NAME amoverview - display file systems processed by
Amanda over time</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS amoverview [[-config ] config] [-hostwidth
width] [-diskwidth width] [-skipmissed] [-last] [-num0]
[-togo0] [-verbose]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Amoverview displays a chart showing hosts
and file systems processed by Amanda along with the backup
level performed each day.</p>

<p>See the amanda(8) man page for more details about
Amanda.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -config config Use configuration config instead
of configuration daily.</p>

<p>-hostwidth width Set host field column width to width
characters instead of 8.</p>

<p>-diskwidth width Set disk field column width to width
characters instead of 20.</p>

<p>-skipmissed Compacts the output by only printing stats
for the days Amanda actually ran.</p>

<p>-last Outputs the last status of each disk at the start.
Useful for long tapecycles and/or sparse reports.</p>

<p>-num0 Outputs the number of level 0 dumps for each
disk.</p>

<p>-togo0 Outputs the number of runs until the last level 0
dump is overwritten.</p>

<p>-verbose Amoverview can take a long while on large
systems. This option reports intermediate steps while it is
working.</p>

<p>RESULTS amoverview is a summary of the output of &quot;
amadmin &lt;config&gt; find &quot;. When the last column of
amadmin find contains anything other than &quot;OK&quot;,
amoverview translates this into &quot;E&quot; for that
day.</p>

<p>A number indicates the level of backup and it succeeded.
An &quot;E&quot; indicates an error for that day. You get an
&quot;E&quot; for all errors, like failed to connect,
datatimeout, computer crashed, etc, but also for failing to
write to tape.</p>

<p>You can have an &quot;E&quot; followed by a number if a
filesystem ran into end-of-tape once (gives an
&quot;E&quot;, and later that day, you flush it to a second
tape (a number: the level, indicating success). If the flush
failed too, you get a double &quot;EE&quot; for that
day.</p>

<p>You can also have a double code if you have two tapes in
the changer and Amanda failed to write to tape the first
time because it hit end of tape (resulting in
&quot;E0&quot;, for a full, &quot;E1&quot; for an
incremental etc.) or twice with error (&quot;EE&quot;), and
may a successful flush afterwards giving maybe
&quot;EE0&quot;. (Only the latest 2 characters are
printed).</p>

<p>EXAMPLE This shows the /home file system on host2 was
backed up at level 3 on the 8th, 9th and 10th of December,
had a full backup on the 11th, a level 1 on the 12th and a
level 2 on the 13th. # amoverview date 12 12 12 12 12 12
host disk 08 09 10 11 12 13</p>

<p>host1 / 0 1 1 1 1 1 host1 /var 0 1 1 1 1 1 host2 / 1 1 1
1 1 0 host2 /home 3 3 3 0 1 2 host2 /opt 1 1 1 1 1 1 host2
/var 1 1 0 1 1 1</p>
