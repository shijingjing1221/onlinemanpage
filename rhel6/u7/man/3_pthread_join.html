<p>PTHREAD_JOIN(3) Linux Programmer s Manual
PTHREAD_JOIN(3)</p>

<p>NAME pthread_join - join with a terminated thread</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;</p>

<p>int pthread_join(pthread_t thread, void **retval);</p>

<p>Compile and link with -pthread.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pthread_join() function waits for the
thread specified by thread to terminate. If that thread has
already terminated, then pthread_join() returns immediately.
The thread specified by thread must be joinable.</p>

<p>If retval is not NULL, then pthread_join() copies the
exit status of the target thread (i.e., the value that the
target thread supplied to pthread_exit(3)) into the location
pointed to by *retval. If the tar- get thread was canceled,
then PTHREAD_CANCELED is placed in *retval.</p>

<p>If multiple threads simultaneously try to join with the
same thread, the results are undefined. If the thread
calling pthread_join() is canceled, then the target thread
will remain joinable (i.e., it will not be detached).</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, pthread_join() returns 0; on
error, it returns an error number.</p>

<p>ERRORS EDEADLK A deadlock was detected (e.g., two
threads tried to join with each other); or thread specifies
the calling thread.</p>

<p>EINVAL thread is not a joinable thread.</p>

<p>EINVAL Another thread is already waiting to join with
this thread.</p>

<p>ESRCH No thread with the ID thread could be found.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>NOTES After a successful call to pthread_create(), the
caller is guaranteed that the target thread has
terminated.</p>

<p>Joining with a thread that has previously been joined
results in unde- fined behavior.</p>

<p>Failure to join with a thread that is joinable (i.e.,
one that is not detached), produces a &quot;zombie
thread&quot;. Avoid doing this, since each zombie thread
consumes some system resources, and when enough zombie
threads have accumulated, it will no longer be possible to
create new threads (or processes).</p>

<p>There is no pthreads analog of waitpid(-1, &amp;status,
0), that is, &quot;join with any terminated thread&quot;. If
you believe you need this functional- ity, you probably need
to rethink your application design.</p>

<p>All of the threads in a process are peers: any thread
can join with any other thread in the process.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE See pthread_create(3).</p>
