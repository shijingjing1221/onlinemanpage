<p>WCSTOMBS(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual WCSTOMBS(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME wcstombs - convert a wide-character string to a
character string</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</p>

<p>size_t wcstombs(char *restrict s, const wchar_t
*restrict pwcs, size_t n);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The wcstombs() function shall convert the
sequence of wide-character codes that are in the array
pointed to by pwcs into a sequence of char- acters that
begins in the initial shift state and store these charac-
ters into the array pointed to by s, stopping if a character
would exceed the limit of n total bytes or if a null byte is
stored. Each wide-character code shall be converted as if by
a call to wctomb(), except that the shift state of wctomb()
shall not be affected.</p>

<p>The behavior of this function shall be affected by the
LC_CTYPE cate- gory of the current locale.</p>

<p>No more than n bytes shall be modified in the array
pointed to by s. If copying takes place between objects that
overlap, the behavior is unde- fined. If s is a null
pointer, wcstombs() shall return the length required to
convert the entire array regardless of the value of n, but
no values are stored.</p>

<p>The wcstombs() function need not be reentrant. A
function that is not required to be reentrant is not
required to be thread-safe.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE If a wide-character code is encountered
that does not correspond to a valid character (of one or
more bytes each), wcstombs() shall return (size_t)-1.
Otherwise, wcstombs() shall return the number of bytes
stored in the character array, not including any terminating
null byte. The array shall not be null-terminated if the
value returned is n.</p>

<p>ERRORS The wcstombs() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EILSEQ A wide-character code does not correspond to a
valid character.</p>
