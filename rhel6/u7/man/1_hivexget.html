<p>hivexget(1) Windows Registry hivexget(1)</p>

<p>NAME hivexget - Get subkey from a Windows Registry
binary &quot;hive&quot; file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS hivexget hivefile &rsquo;PathToKey&rsquo;</p>

<p>hivexget hivefile &rsquo;PathToKey&rsquo; name</p>

<p>NOTE This is a low-level tool. For a more convenient way
to navigate the Windows Registry in Windows virtual
machines, see virt-win-reg(1). For proper regedit
formatting, use hivexregedit(1).</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program navigates through a Windows
Registry binary &quot;hive&quot; file and extracts either
all the (key, value) data pairs stored in that subkey or
just the single named data item.</p>

<p>In the first form:</p>

<p>hivexget hivefile &rsquo;PathToKey&rsquo;</p>

<p>&quot;hivefile&quot; is some Windows Registry binary
hive, and &quot;PathTokey&quot; is a path within that hive.
NB the path is relative to the top of this hive, and is not
the full path as you would use in Windows (eg.
&quot;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINETEM&quot; is not a valid path).</p>

<p>If the subkey exists, then the output lists all data
pairs under this subkey, in a format similar to
&quot;regedit&quot; in Windows.</p>

<p>In the second form:</p>

<p>hivexget hivefile &rsquo;PathToKey&rsquo; name</p>

<p>&quot;hivefile&quot; and path are as above.
&quot;name&quot; is the name of the value of interest (use
&quot;@&quot; for the default value).</p>

<p>The corresponding data item is printed &quot;raw&quot;
(ie. no processing or escaping) except:</p>

<p>1. If its a string we will convert it from Windows
UTF-16 to UTF-8, if this conversion is possible. The string
is printed with a single trailing newline.</p>

<p>2. If its a multiple-string value, each string is
printed on a separate line.</p>

<p>3. If its a numeric value, it is printed as a decimal
number.</p>
