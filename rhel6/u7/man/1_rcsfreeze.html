<p>NAME rcsfreeze - freeze a configuration of sources
checked in under RCS</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rcsfreeze [name]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION rcsfreeze assigns a symbolic revision number
to a set of RCS files that form a valid configuration.</p>

<p>The idea is to run rcsfreeze each time a new version is
checked in. A unique symbolic name (C_number, where number
is increased each time rcsfreeze is run) is then assigned to
the most recent revision of each RCS file of the main
trunk.</p>

<p>An optional name argument to rcsfreeze gives a symbolic
name to the configuration. The unique identifier is still
generated and is listed in the log file but it will not
appear as part of the symbolic revision name in the actual
RCS files.</p>

<p>A log message is requested from the user for future
reference.</p>

<p>The shell script works only on all RCS files at one
time. All changed files must be checked in already. Run
rcsclean(1) first and see whether any sources remain in the
current directory.</p>

<p>FILES RCS/.rcsfreeze.ver version number</p>

<p>RCS/.rcsfreeze.log log messages, most recent first</p>

<p>BUGS rcsfreeze does not check whether any sources are
checked out and modi- fied.</p>

<p>Although both source file names and RCS file names are
accepted, they are not paired as usual with RCS
commands.</p>

<p>Error checking is rudimentary.</p>

<p>rcsfreeze is just an optional example shell script, and
should not be taken too seriously. See CVS for a more
complete solution.</p>
