<p>XmStringNCopy(library call) XmStringNCopy(library
call)</p>

<p>NAME XmStringNCopy A compound string function that
creates a copy of a compound string</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;Xm/Xm.h&gt; XmString
XmStringNCopy( XmString s1, int num_bytes);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This function is obsolete and exists for
compatibility with previous releases. XmStringNCopy creates
a copy of s1 that contains a specified number of bytes,
including tags, directional indicators, and separa- tors. It
then returns the resulting compound string. The original
strings are preserved. The function allocates space for the
resulting compound string. The application is responsible
for managing the allo- cated space. The application can
recover the allocated space by call- ing XmStringFree.</p>

<p>s1 Specifies the compound string.</p>

<p>num_bytes Specifies the number of bytes of s1 to copy.
If this value is less than the length of s1, as many bytes
as possible, but possibly fewer than this value, will be
appended to s1 such that the resulting string is still a
valid compound string.</p>

<p>RETURN Returns a new compound string.</p>
