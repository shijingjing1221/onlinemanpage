<p>SENDMSG(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual SENDMSG(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME sendmsg - send a message on a socket using a
message structure</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;</p>

<p>ssize_t sendmsg(int socket, const struct msghdr
*message, int flags);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sendmsg() function shall send a message
through a connection-mode or connectionless-mode socket. If
the socket is connectionless-mode, the message shall be sent
to the address specified by msghdr. If the socket is
connection-mode, the destination address in msghdr shall be
ignored.</p>

<p>The sendmsg() function takes the following
arguments:</p>

<p>socket Specifies the socket file descriptor.</p>

<p>message Points to a msghdr structure, containing both
the destination address and the buffers for the outgoing
message. The length and format of the address depend on the
address family of the socket. The msg_flags member is
ignored.</p>

<p>flags Specifies the type of message transmission. The
application may specify 0 or the following flag:</p>

<p>MSG_EOR Terminates a record (if supported by the
protocol).</p>

<p>MSG_OOB Sends out-of-band data on sockets that support
out-of-bound data. The significance and semantics of
out-of-band data are protocol-specific.</p>

<p>The msg_iov and msg_iovlen fields of message specify
zero or more buffers containing the data to be sent. msg_iov
points to an array of iovec structures; msg_iovlen shall be
set to the dimension of this array. In each iovec structure,
the iov_base field specifies a storage area and the iov_len
field gives its size in bytes. Some of these sizes can be
zero. The data from each storage area indicated by msg_iov
is sent in turn.</p>

<p>Successful completion of a call to sendmsg() does not
guarantee deliv- ery of the message. A return value of -1
indicates only locally- detected errors.</p>

<p>If space is not available at the sending socket to hold
the message to be transmitted and the socket file descriptor
does not have O_NONBLOCK set, the sendmsg() function shall
block until space is available. If space is not available at
the sending socket to hold the message to be transmitted and
the socket file descriptor does have O_NONBLOCK set, the
sendmsg() function shall fail.</p>

<p>If the socket protocol supports broadcast and the
specified address is a broadcast address for the socket
protocol, sendmsg() shall fail if the SO_BROADCAST option is
not set for the socket.</p>

<p>The socket in use may require the process to have
appropriate privi- leges to use the sendmsg() function.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, sendmsg() shall
return the number of bytes sent. Otherwise, -1 shall be
returned and errno set to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The sendmsg() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EAGAIN or EWOULDBLOCK The socket s file descriptor is
marked O_NONBLOCK and the requested operation would
block.</p>

<p>EAFNOSUPPORT Addresses in the specified address family
cannot be used with this socket.</p>

<p>EBADF The socket argument is not a valid file
descriptor.</p>

<p>ECONNRESET A connection was forcibly closed by a
peer.</p>

<p>EINTR A signal interrupted sendmsg() before any data was
transmitted.</p>

<p>EINVAL The sum of the iov_len values overflows an
ssize_t.</p>

<p>EMSGSIZE The message is too large to be sent all at once
(as the socket requires), or the msg_iovlen member of the
msghdr structure pointed to by message is less than or equal
to 0 or is greater than {IOV_MAX}.</p>

<p>ENOTCONN The socket is connection-mode but is not
connected.</p>

<p>ENOTSOCK The socket argument does not refer to a
socket.</p>

<p>EOPNOTSUPP The socket argument is associated with a
socket that does not support one or more of the values set
in flags.</p>

<p>EPIPE The socket is shut down for writing, or the socket
is connec- tion-mode and is no longer connected. In the
latter case, and if the socket is of type SOCK_STREAM, the
SIGPIPE signal is gener- ated to the calling thread.</p>

<p>If the address family of the socket is AF_UNIX, then
sendmsg() shall fail if:</p>

<p>EIO An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing
to the file system.</p>

<p>ELOOP A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during
resolution of the pathname in the socket address.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG A component of a pathname exceeded
{NAME_MAX} characters, or an entire pathname exceeded
{PATH_MAX} characters.</p>

<p>ENOENT A component of the pathname does not name an
existing file or the path name is an empty string.</p>

<p>ENOTDIR A component of the path prefix of the pathname
in the socket address is not a directory.</p>

<p>The sendmsg() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EACCES Search permission is denied for a component of
the path prefix; or write access to the named socket is
denied.</p>

<p>EDESTADDRREQ The socket is not connection-mode and does
not have its peer address set, and no destination address
was specified.</p>

<p>EHOSTUNREACH The destination host cannot be reached
(probably because the host is down or a remote router cannot
reach it).</p>

<p>EIO An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing
to the file system.</p>

<p>EISCONN A destination address was specified and the
socket is already connected.</p>

<p>ENETDOWN The local network interface used to reach the
destination is down.</p>

<p>ENETUNREACH No route to the network is present.</p>

<p>ENOBUFS Insufficient resources were available in the
system to perform the operation.</p>

<p>ENOMEM Insufficient memory was available to fulfill the
request.</p>

<p>If the address family of the socket is AF_UNIX, then
sendmsg() may fail if:</p>

<p>ELOOP More than {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic links were
encountered during resolution of the pathname in the socket
address.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG Pathname resolution of a symbolic link
produced an intermediate result whose length exceeds
{PATH_MAX}.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Done.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The select() and poll() functions can
be used to determine when it is possible to send more
data.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
