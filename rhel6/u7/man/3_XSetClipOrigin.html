<p>XSetClipOrigin(3) XLIB FUNCTIONS XSetClipOrigin(3)</p>

<p>NAME XSetClipOrigin, XSetClipMask, XSetClipRectangles -
GC convenience rou- tines</p>

<p>SYNTAX int XSetClipOrigin(Display *display, GC gc, int
clip_x_origin, int clip_y_origin);</p>

<p>int XSetClipMask(Display *display, GC gc, Pixmap
pixmap);</p>

<p>int XSetClipRectangles(Display *display, GC gc, int
clip_x_origin, int clip_y_origin, XRectangle rectangles[],
int n, int ordering);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS display Specifies the connection to the X
server.</p>

<p>clip_x_origin clip_y_origin Specify the x and y
coordinates of the clip-mask origin.</p>

<p>gc Specifies the GC.</p>

<p>n Specifies the number of rectangles.</p>

<p>ordering Specifies the ordering relations on the
rectangles. You can pass Unsorted, YSorted, YXSorted, or
YXBanded.</p>

<p>pixmap Specifies the pixmap or None.</p>

<p>rectangles Specifies an array of rectangles that define
the clip-mask.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The XSetClipOrigin function sets the clip
origin in the specified GC. The clip-mask origin is
interpreted relative to the origin of whatever destination
drawable is specified in the graphics request.</p>

<p>XSetClipOrigin can generate BadAlloc and BadGC
errors.</p>

<p>The XSetClipMask function sets the clip-mask in the
specified GC to the specified pixmap. If the clip-mask is
set to None, the pixels are are always drawn (regardless of
the clip-origin).</p>

<p>XSetClipMask can generate BadAlloc, BadGC, BadMatch, and
BadValue errors.</p>

<p>The XSetClipRectangles function changes the clip-mask in
the specified GC to the specified list of rectangles and
sets the clip origin. The output is clipped to remain
contained within the rectangles. The clip- origin is
interpreted relative to the origin of whatever destination
drawable is specified in a graphics request. The rectangle
coordinates are interpreted relative to the clip-origin. The
rectangles should be nonintersecting, or the graphics
results will be undefined. Note that the list of rectangles
can be empty, which effectively disables output. This is the
opposite of passing None as the clip-mask in XCreateGC,
XChangeGC, and XSetClipMask.</p>

<p>If known by the client, ordering relations on the
rectangles can be specified with the ordering argument. This
may provide faster opera- tion by the server. If an
incorrect ordering is specified, the X server may generate a
BadMatch error, but it is not required to do so. If no error
is generated, the graphics results are undefined. Unsorted
means the rectangles are in arbitrary order. YSorted means
that the rectangles are nondecreasing in their Y origin.
YXSorted additionally constrains YSorted order in that all
rectangles with an equal Y origin are nondecreasing in their
X origin. YXBanded additionally constrains YXSorted by
requiring that, for every possible Y scanline, all rectan-
gles that include that scanline have an identical Y origins
and Y extents.</p>

<p>XSetClipRectangles can generate BadAlloc, BadGC,
BadMatch, and BadValue errors.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS BadAlloc The server failed to allocate the
requested resource or server memory.</p>

<p>BadGC A value for a GContext argument does not name a
defined GCon- text.</p>

<p>BadMatch Some argument or pair of arguments has the
correct type and range but fails to match in some other way
required by the request.</p>

<p>BadValue Some numeric value falls outside the range of
values accepted by the request. Unless a specific range is
specified for an argument, the full range defined by the
argument s type is accepted. Any argument defined as a set
of alternatives can generate this error.</p>
