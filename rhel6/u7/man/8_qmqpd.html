<p>NAME qmqpd - Postfix QMQP server</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS qmqpd [generic Postfix daemon options]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The Postfix QMQP server receives one message
per connection. Each mes- sage is piped through the
cleanup(8) daemon, and is placed into the incoming queue as
one single queue file. The program expects to be run from
the master(8) process manager.</p>

<p>The QMQP server implements one access policy: only
explicitly autho- rized client hosts are allowed to use the
service.</p>

<p>SECURITY The QMQP server is moderately
security-sensitive. It talks to QMQP clients and to DNS
servers on the network. The QMQP server can be run chrooted
at fixed low privilege.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS Problems and transactions are logged to
syslogd(8).</p>

<p>BUGS The QMQP protocol provides only one server reply
per message delivery. It is therefore not possible to reject
individual recipients.</p>

<p>The QMQP protocol requires the server to receive the
entire message before replying. If a message is malformed,
or if any netstring compo- nent is longer than acceptable,
Postfix replies immediately and closes the connection. It is
left up to the client to handle the situation.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS Changes to main.cf are picked
up automatically, as qmqpd(8) processes run for only a
limited amount of time. Use the command &quot;postfix
reload&quot; to speed up a change.</p>

<p>The text below provides only a parameter summary. See
postconf(5) for more details including examples.</p>

<p>CONTENT INSPECTION CONTROLS content_filter (empty) The
name of a mail delivery transport that filters mail after it
is queued.</p>

<p>receive_override_options (empty) Enable or disable
recipient validation, built-in content filter- ing, or
address mapping.</p>

<p>RESOURCE AND RATE CONTROLS line_length_limit (2048) Upon
input, long lines are chopped up into pieces of at most this
length; upon delivery, long lines are reconstructed.</p>

<p>hopcount_limit (50) The maximal number of Received:
message headers that is allowed in the primary message
headers.</p>

<p>message_size_limit (10240000) The maximal size in bytes
of a message, including envelope information.</p>

<p>qmqpd_timeout (300s) The time limit for sending or
receiving information over the network.</p>

<p>TROUBLE SHOOTING CONTROLS debug_peer_level (2) The
increment in verbose logging level when a remote client or
server matches a pattern in the debug_peer_list
parameter.</p>

<p>debug_peer_list (empty) Optional list of remote client
or server hostname or network address patterns that cause
the verbose logging level to increase by the amount
specified in $debug_peer_level.</p>

<p>soft_bounce (no) Safety net to keep mail queued that
would otherwise be returned to the sender.</p>

<p>TARPIT CONTROLS qmqpd_error_delay (1s) How long the QMQP
server will pause before sending a negative reply to the
client.</p>

<p>MISCELLANEOUS CONTROLS config_directory (seepostconf
-doutput) The default location of the Postfix main.cf and
master.cf con- figuration files.</p>

<p>daemon_timeout (18000s) How much time a Postfix daemon
process may take to handle a request before it is terminated
by a built-in watchdog timer.</p>

<p>ipc_timeout (3600s) The time limit for sending or
receiving information over an internal communication
channel.</p>

<p>max_idle (100s) The maximum amount of time that an idle
Postfix daemon process waits for an incoming connection
before terminating voluntarily.</p>

<p>max_use (100) The maximal number of incoming connections
that a Postfix daemon process will service before
terminating voluntarily.</p>

<p>process_id (read-only) The process ID of a Postfix
command or daemon process.</p>

<p>process_name (read-only) The process name of a Postfix
command or daemon process.</p>

<p>qmqpd_authorized_clients (empty) What clients are
allowed to connect to the QMQP server port.</p>

<p>queue_directory (seepostconf -doutput) The location of
the Postfix top-level queue directory.</p>

<p>syslog_facility (mail) The syslog facility of Postfix
logging.</p>

<p>syslog_name (seepostconf -doutput) The mail system name
that is prepended to the process name in syslog records, so
that &quot;smtpd&quot; becomes, for example, &quot;post-
fix/smtpd&quot;.</p>

<p>verp_delimiter_filter (-=+) The characters Postfix
accepts as VERP delimiter characters on the Postfix
sendmail(1) command line and in SMTP commands.</p>

<p>Available in Postfix version 2.5 and later:</p>

<p>qmqpd_client_port_logging (no) Enable logging of the
remote QMQP client port in addition to the hostname and IP
address.</p>
