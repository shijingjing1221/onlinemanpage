<p>NAME XmPrintPopupPDM Send a notification for the PDM to
be popped up</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;Xm/Print.h&gt; XtEnum
XmPrintPopupPDM( Widgetprint_shell,
Widgetvideo_transient_for);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION A convenience function that sends a
notification to start a Print Dia- log Manager on behalf of
the application, XmPrintPopupPDM hides the details of the X
selection mechanism used to notify the PDM that a new dialog
must be popped up for this application.</p>

<p>XmPrintPopupPDM sends a selection request to either the
print display of the print shell, or the video display of
the transient_for video widget (depending on the environment
variable XPDMDISPLAY, which can only takes the value
&quot;print&quot; or &quot;video&quot;), asking for the PDM
windows to be popped up on behalf of the app.</p>

<p>Return right away with status of XmPDM_NOTIFY_FAIL (e.g.
if the func- tion couldnt malloc memory for the selection
value, or if XPDMDISPLAY is not &quot;print&quot; or
&quot;video&quot;) or with XmPDM_NOTIFY_SUCCESS , which only
means a &quot;message&quot; was sent out to the PDM
specified by XPDMSELECTION , not that its already up on the
screen yet.</p>

<p>In order to know if the PDM is up, or not running, the
application must register a XmNpdmNotificationCallback with
the Print Shell.</p>

<p>XmPrintPopupPDM puts up an InputOnly window on top of
the dialog, so that the end user doesnt use the print setup
dialog while the PDM is trying to come up. This window is
automatically removed when the shell is about to call the
callback for the first time.</p>

<p>print_shell The Print Shell used for this print job and
context.</p>

<p>video_transient_for The video widget dealing with
application print setup.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Returns XmPDM_NOTIFY_SUCCESS if the
function was able to send the noti- fication out to the PDM
process, XmPDM_NOTIFY_FAIL otherwise.</p>

<p>ERRORS/WARNINGS Not applicable.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Example of callback from a Print set up dialog
box &quot;Setup...&quot; button:</p>

<p>PrintSetupCallback(print_dialog...) /*-------------*/ {
if (XmPrintPopupPDM (pshell, XtParent(print_dialog)) !=
XmPDM_NOTIFY_SUCCESS) { /* some error dialog */ } }</p>

<p>Example of XmNpdmNotificationCallback from a Print
Shell:</p>

<p>pdmNotifyCB(print_shell...) { XmPrintShellCallBackStruct
* pr_cb = ...</p>

<p>switch (pr_cb-&gt;reason) { case XmCR_PDM_NONE: /* no
PDM available */ PostErrorDialog(...); break; case
XmCR_PDM_VXAUTH: /* PDM is not authorized ... */
PostErrorDialog(...); break; case XmCR_PDM_UP: the PDM is up
and running /* everything is fine */ break; default: /*
other cases */ } }</p>
