<p>NAME wpa_background - Background information on Wi-Fi
Protected Access and IEEE 802.11i</p>

<p>WPA The original security mechanism of IEEE 802.11
standard was not designed to be strong and has proven to be
insufficient for most net- works that require some kind of
security. Task group I (Security) of IEEE 802.11 working
group (http://www.ieee802.org/11/) has worked to address the
flaws of the base standard and has in practice completed its
work in May 2004. The IEEE 802.11i amendment to the IEEE
802.11 standard was approved in June 2004 and published in
July 2004.</p>

<p>Wi-Fi Alliance (http://www.wi-fi.org/) used a draft
version of the IEEE 802.11i work (draft 3.0) to define a
subset of the security enhance- ments that can be
implemented with existing wlan hardware. This is called
Wi-Fi Protected Access&lt;TM&gt; (WPA). This has now become
a manda- tory component of interoperability testing and
certification done by Wi-Fi Alliance. Wi-Fi provides
information about WPA at its web site
(http://www.wi-fi.org/OpenSection/protected_access.asp).</p>

<p>IEEE 802.11 standard defined wired equivalent privacy
(WEP) algorithm for protecting wireless networks. WEP uses
RC4 with 40-bit keys, 24-bit initialization vector (IV), and
CRC32 to protect against packet forgery. All these choices
have proven to be insufficient: key space is too small
against current attacks, RC4 key scheduling is insufficient
(beginning of the pseudorandom stream should be skipped), IV
space is too small and IV reuse makes attacks easier, there
is no replay protec- tion, and non-keyed authentication does
not protect against bit flip- ping packet data.</p>

<p>WPA is an intermediate solution for the security issues.
It uses Tempo- ral Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) to replace
WEP. TKIP is a compromise on strong security and possibility
to use existing hardware. It still uses RC4 for the
encryption like WEP, but with per-packet RC4 keys. In
addition, it implements replay protection, keyed packet
authentication mechanism (Michael MIC).</p>

<p>Keys can be managed using two different mechanisms. WPA
can either use an external authentication server (e.g.,
RADIUS) and EAP just like IEEE 802.1X is using or pre-shared
keys without need for additional servers. Wi-Fi calls these
&quot;WPA-Enterprise&quot; and &quot;WPA-Personal&quot;,
respectively. Both mechanisms will generate a master session
key for the Authentica- tor (AP) and Supplicant (client
station).</p>

<p>WPA implements a new key handshake (4-Way Handshake and
Group Key Hand- shake) for generating and exchanging data
encryption keys between the Authenticator and Supplicant.
This handshake is also used to verify that both
Authenticator and Supplicant know the master session key.
These handshakes are identical regardless of the selected
key manage- ment mechanism (only the method for generating
master session key changes).</p>

<p>IEEE 802.11I / WPA2 The design for parts of IEEE 802.11i
that were not included in WPA has finished (May 2004) and
this amendment to IEEE 802.11 was approved in June 2004.
Wi-Fi Alliance is using the final IEEE 802.11i as a new ver-
sion of WPA called WPA2. This includes, e.g., support for
more robust encryption algorithm (CCMP: AES in Counter mode
with CBC-MAC) to replace TKIP and optimizations for handoff
(reduced number of messages in initial key handshake,
pre-authentication, and PMKSA caching).</p>
