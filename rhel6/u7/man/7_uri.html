<p>DESCRIPTION A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a
short string of characters identifying an abstract or
physical resource (for example, a web page). A Uniform
Resource Locator (URL) is a URI that identifies a resource
through its primary access mechanism (e.g., its network
&quot;location&quot;), rather than by name or some other
attribute of that resource. A Uni- form Resource Name (URN)
is a URI that must remain globally unique and persistent
even when the resource ceases to exist or becomes unavail-
able.</p>

<p>URIs are the standard way to name hypertext link
destinations for tools such as web browsers. The string
&quot;http://www.kernelnotes.org&quot; is a URL (and thus it
is also a URI). Many people use the term URL loosely as a
synonym for URI (though technically URLs are a subset of
URIs).</p>

<p>URIs can be absolute or relative. An absolute identifier
refers to a resource independent of context, while a
relative identifier refers to a resource by describing the
difference from the current context. Within a relative path
reference, the complete path segments &quot;.&quot; and
&quot;..&quot; have special meanings: &quot;the current
hierarchy level&quot; and &quot;the level above this
hierarchy level&quot;, respectively, just like they do in
Unix-like systems. A path segment which contains a colon
character cant be used as the first segment of a relative
URI path (e.g., &quot;this:that&quot;), because it would be
mistaken for a scheme name; precede such segments with ./
(e.g., &quot;./this:that&quot;). Note that descendants of
MS-DOS (e.g., Microsoft Windows) replace devicename colons
with the vertical bar (&quot;|&quot;) in URIs, so
&quot;C:&quot; becomes &quot;C|&quot;.</p>

<p>A fragment identifier, if included, refers to a
particular named por- tion (fragment) of a resource; text
after a &rsquo;#&rsquo; identifies the frag- ment. A URI
beginning with &rsquo;#&rsquo; refers to that fragment in
the current resource.</p>

<p>Usage There are many different URI schemes, each with
specific additional rules and meanings, but they are
intentionally made to be as similar as possible. For
example, many URL schemes permit the authority to be the
following format, called here an ip_server (square brackets
show whats optional):</p>

<p>ip_server = [user [ : password ] @ ] host [ : port]</p>

<p>This format allows you to optionally insert a username,
a user plus password, and/or a port number. The host is the
name of the host com- puter, either its name as determined
by DNS or an IP address (numbers separated by periods). Thus
the URI &lt;http://fred:fredpass- word@xyz.com:8080/&gt;
logs into a web server on host xyz.com as fred (using
fredpassword) using port 8080. Avoid including a password in
a URI if possible because of the many security risks of
having a password written down. If the URL supplies a
username but no password, and the remote server requests a
password, the program interpreting the URL should request
one from the user.</p>

<p>Here are some of the most common schemes in use on
Unix-like systems that are understood by many tools. Note
that many tools using URIs also have internal schemes or
specialized schemes; see those tools documentation for
information on those schemes.</p>

<p>http - Web (HTTP) server</p>

<p>http://ip_server/path http://ip_server/path?query</p>

<p>This is a URL accessing a web (HTTP) server. The default
port is 80. If the path refers to a directory, the web
server will choose what to return; usually if there is a
file named &quot;index.html&quot; or &quot;index.htm&quot;
its content is returned, otherwise, a list of the files in
the current directory (with appropriate links) is generated
and returned. An exam- ple is &lt;http://lwn.net&gt;.</p>

<p>A query can be given in the archaic &quot;isindex&quot;
format, consisting of a word or phrase and not including an
equal sign (=). A query can also be in the longer
&quot;GET&quot; format, which has one or more query entries
of the form key=value separated by the ampersand character
(&amp;). Note that key can be repeated more than once,
though it s up to the web server and its application
programs to determine if theres any meaning to that. There
is an unfortunate interaction with HTML/XML/SGML and the GET
query format; when such URIs with more than one key are
embedded in SGML/XML documents (including HTML), the
ampersand (&amp;) has to be rewritten as &amp;amp;. Note
that not all queries use this format; larger forms may be
too long to store as a URI, so they use a different inter-
action mechanism (called POST) which does not include the
data in the URI. See the Common Gateway Interface
specification at &lt;http://www.w3.org/CGI&gt; for more
information.</p>

<p>ftp - File Transfer Protocol (FTP)</p>

<p>ftp://ip_server/path</p>

<p>This is a URL accessing a file through the file transfer
protocol (FTP). The default port (for control) is 21. If no
username is included, the username &quot;anonymous&quot; is
supplied, and in that case many clients provide as the
password the requestor s Internet email address. An example
is &lt;ftp://ftp.is.co.za/rfc/rfc1808.txt&gt;.</p>

<p>gopher - Gopher server</p>

<p>gopher://ip_server/gophertype selector
gopher://ip_server/gophertype selector%09search
gopher://ip_server/gophertype
selector%09search%09gopher+_string</p>

<p>The default gopher port is 70. gophertype is a
single-character field to denote the Gopher type of the
resource to which the URL refers. The entire path may also
be empty, in which case the delimiting &quot;/&quot; is also
optional and the gophertype defaults to &quot;1&quot;.</p>

<p>selector is the Gopher selector string. In the Gopher
protocol, Gopher selector strings are a sequence of octets
which may contain any octets except 09 hexadecimal (US-ASCII
HT or tab), 0A hexadecimal (US-ASCII character LF), and 0D
(US-ASCII character CR).</p>

<p>mailto - Email address</p>

<p>mailto:email-address</p>

<p>This is an email address, usually of the form
name@hostname. See mailaddr(7) for more information on the
correct format of an email address. Note that any %
character must be rewritten as %25. An exam- ple is
&lt;mailto:dwheeler@dwheeler.com&gt;.</p>

<p>news - Newsgroup or News message</p>

<p>news:newsgroup-name news:message-id</p>

<p>A newsgroup-name is a period-delimited hierarchical
name, such as &quot;comp.infosystems.www.misc&quot;. If
&lt;newsgroup-name&gt; is &quot;*&quot; (as in
&lt;news:*&gt;), it is used to refer to &quot;all available
news groups&quot;. An example is
&lt;news:comp.lang.ada&gt;.</p>

<p>A message-id corresponds to the Message-ID of IETF RFC
1036, without the enclosing &quot;&lt;&quot; and
&quot;&gt;&quot;; it takes the form unique@full_domain_name.
A message identifier may be distinguished from a news group
name by the presence of the &quot;@&quot; character.</p>

<p>telnet - Telnet login</p>

<p>telnet://ip_server/</p>

<p>The Telnet URL scheme is used to designate interactive
text services that may be accessed by the Telnet protocol.
The final &quot;/&quot; character may be omitted. The
default port is 23. An example is &lt;tel-
net://melvyl.ucop.edu/&gt;.</p>

<p>file - Normal file</p>

<p>file://ip_server/path_segments file:path_segments</p>

<p>This represents a file or directory accessible locally.
As a special case, host can be the string
&quot;localhost&quot; or the empty string; this is
interpreted as &quot;the machine from which the URL is being
interpreted&quot;. If the path is to a directory, the viewer
should display the direc- torys contents with links to each
containee; not all viewers currently do this. KDE supports
generated files through the URL &lt;file:/cgi-bin&gt;. If
the given file isnt found, browser writers may want to try
to expand the filename via filename globbing (see glob(7)
and glob(3)).</p>

<p>The second format (e.g., &lt;file:/etc/passwd&gt;) is a
correct format for referring to a local file. However, older
standards did not permit this format, and some programs dont
recognize this as a URI. A more portable syntax is to use an
empty string as the server name, for exam- ple,
&lt;file:///etc/passwd&gt;; this form does the same thing
and is easily recognized by pattern matchers and older
programs as a URI. Note that if you really mean to say
&quot;start from the current location,&quot; dont specify
the scheme at all; use a relative address like
&lt;../test.txt&gt;, which has the side-effect of being
scheme-independent. An example of this scheme is
&lt;file:///etc/passwd&gt;.</p>

<p>man - Man page documentation</p>

<p>man:command-name man:command-name(section)</p>

<p>This refers to local online manual (man) reference
pages. The command name can optionally be followed by a
parenthesis and section number; see man(7) for more
information on the meaning of the section numbers. This URI
scheme is unique to Unix-like systems (such as Linux) and is
not currently registered by the IETF. An example is
&lt;man:ls(1)&gt;.</p>

<p>info - Info page documentation</p>

<p>info:virtual-filename info:virtual-filename#nodename
info:(virtual-filename) info:(virtual-filename)nodename</p>

<p>This scheme refers to online info reference pages
(generated from tex- info files), a documentation format
used by programs such as the GNU tools. This URI scheme is
unique to Unix-like systems (such as Linux) and is not
currently registered by the IETF. As of this writing, GNOME
and KDE differ in their URI syntax and do not accept the
others syn- tax. The first two formats are the GNOME format;
in nodenames all spaces are written as underscores. The
second two formats are the KDE format; spaces in nodenames
must be written as spaces, even though this is forbidden by
the URI standards. Its hoped that in the future most tools
will understand all of these formats and will always accept
underscores for spaces in nodenames. In both GNOME and KDE,
if the form without the nodename is used the nodename is
assumed to be &quot;Top&quot;. Examples of the GNOME format
are &lt;info:gcc&gt; and &lt;info:gcc#G++_and_GCC&gt;.
Examples of the KDE format are &lt;info:(gcc)&gt; and
&lt;info:(gcc)G++ and GCC&gt;.</p>

<p>whatis - Documentation search</p>

<p>whatis:string</p>

<p>This scheme searches the database of short (one-line)
descriptions of commands and returns a list of descriptions
containing that string. Only complete word matches are
returned. See whatis(1). This URI scheme is unique to
Unix-like systems (such as Linux) and is not cur- rently
registered by the IETF.</p>

<p>ghelp - GNOME help documentation</p>

<p>ghelp:name-of-application</p>

<p>This loads GNOME help for the given application. Note
that not much documentation currently exists in this
format.</p>

<p>ldap - Lightweight Directory Access Protocol</p>

<p>ldap://hostport ldap://hostport/ ldap://hostport/dn
ldap://hostport/dn?attributes
ldap://hostport/dn?attributes?scope
ldap://hostport/dn?attributes?scope?filter
ldap://hostport/dn?attributes?scope?filter?extensions</p>

<p>This scheme supports queries to the Lightweight
Directory Access Proto- col (LDAP), a protocol for querying
a set of servers for hierarchically organized information
(such as people and computing resources). More information
on the LDAP URL scheme is available in RFC 2255. The com-
ponents of this URL are:</p>

<p>hostport the LDAP server to query, written as a hostname
optionally followed by a colon and the port number. The
default LDAP port is TCP port 389. If empty, the client
determines which the LDAP server to use.</p>

<p>dn the LDAP Distinguished Name, which identifies the
base object of the LDAP search (see RFC 2253 section 3).</p>

<p>attributes a comma-separated list of attributes to be
returned; see RFC 2251 section 4.1.5. If omitted, all
attributes should be returned.</p>

<p>scope specifies the scope of the search, which can be
one of &quot;base&quot; (for a base object search),
&quot;one&quot; (for a one-level search), or &quot;sub&quot;
(for a subtree search). If scope is omitted,
&quot;base&quot; is assumed.</p>

<p>filter specifies the search filter (subset of entries to
return). If omitted, all entries should be returned. See RFC
2254 section 4.</p>

<p>extensions a comma-separated list of type=value pairs,
where the =value portion may be omitted for options not
requiring it. An extension prefixed with a &rsquo;!&rsquo;
is critical (must be sup- ported to be valid), otherwise it
is non-critical (optional).</p>

<p>LDAP queries are easiest to explain by example. Heres a
query that asks ldap.itd.umich.edu for information about the
University of Michi- gan in the U.S.:</p>


<p>ldap://ldap.itd.umich.edu/o=University%20of%20Michigan,c=US</p>

<p>To just get its postal address attribute, request:</p>


<p>ldap://ldap.itd.umich.edu/o=University%20of%20Michigan,c=US?postalAddress</p>

<p>To ask a host.com at port 6666 for information about the
person with common name (cn) &quot;Babs Jensen&quot; at
University of Michigan, request:</p>


<p>ldap://host.com:6666/o=University%20of%20Michigan,c=US??sub?(cn=Babs%20Jensen)</p>

<p>wais - Wide Area Information Servers</p>

<p>wais://hostport/database wais://hostport/database?search
wais://hostport/database/wtype/wpath</p>

<p>This scheme designates a WAIS database, search, or
document (see IETF RFC 1625 for more information on WAIS).
Hostport is the hostname, optionally followed by a colon and
port number (the default port number is 210).</p>

<p>The first form designates a WAIS database for searching.
The second form designates a particular search of the WAIS
database database. The third form designates a particular
document within a WAIS database to be retrieved. wtype is
the WAIS designation of the type of the object and wpath is
the WAIS document-id.</p>

<p>other schemes</p>

<p>There are many other URI schemes. Most tools that accept
URIs support a set of internal URIs (e.g., Mozilla has the
about: scheme for inter- nal information, and the GNOME help
browser has the toc: scheme for various starting locations).
There are many schemes that have been defined but are not as
widely used at the current time (e.g., pros- pero). The
nntp: scheme is deprecated in favor of the news: scheme.
URNs are to be supported by the urn: scheme, with a
hierarchical name space (e.g., urn:ietf:... would identify
IETF documents); at this time URNs are not widely
implemented. Not all tools support all schemes.</p>

<p>Character Encoding URIs use a limited number of
characters so that they can be typed in and used in a
variety of situations.</p>

<p>The following characters are reserved, that is, they may
appear in a URI but their use is limited to their reserved
purpose (conflicting data must be escaped before forming the
URI):</p>

<p>; / ? : @ &amp; = + $ ,</p>

<p>Unreserved characters may be included in a URI.
Unreserved characters include upper and lower case English
letters, decimal digits, and the following limited set of
punctuation marks and symbols:</p>

<p>- _ . ! ~ * ( )</p>

<p>All other characters must be escaped. An escaped octet
is encoded as a character triplet, consisting of the percent
character &quot;%&quot; followed by the two hexadecimal
digits representing the octet code (you can use upper or
lower case letters for the hexadecimal digits). For example,
a blank space must be escaped as &quot;%20&quot;, a tab
character as &quot;%09&quot;, and the &quot;&amp;&quot; as
&quot;%26&quot;. Because the percent &quot;%&quot; character
always has the reserved purpose of being the escape
indicator, it must be escaped as &quot;%25&quot;. It is
common practice to escape space characters as the plus
symbol (+) in query text; this practice isnt uniformly
defined in the relevant RFCs (which recommend %20 instead)
but any tool accepting URIs with query text should be
prepared for them. A URI is always shown in its
&quot;escaped&quot; form.</p>

<p>Unreserved characters can be escaped without changing
the semantics of the URI, but this should not be done unless
the URI is being used in a context that does not allow the
unescaped character to appear. For example, &quot;%7e&quot;
is sometimes used instead of &quot;~&quot; in an HTTP URL
path, but the two are equivalent for an HTTP URL.</p>

<p>For URIs which must handle characters outside the US
ASCII character set, the HTML 4.01 specification (section
B.2) and IETF RFC 2718 (sec- tion 2.2.5) recommend the
following approach:</p>

<p>1. translate the character sequences into UTF-8 (IETF
RFC 2279) see utf-8(7) and then</p>

<p>2. use the URI escaping mechanism, that is, use the %HH
encoding for unsafe octets.</p>

<p>Writing a URI When written, URIs should be placed inside
double quotes (e.g.,
&quot;http://www.kernelnotes.org&quot;), enclosed in angle
brackets (e.g., &lt;http://lwn.net&gt;), or placed on a line
by themselves. A warning for those who use double-quotes:
never move extraneous punctuation (such as the period ending
a sentence or the comma in a list) inside a URI, since this
will change the value of the URI. Instead, use angle brack-
ets instead, or switch to a quoting system that never
includes extrane- ous characters inside quotation marks.
This latter system, called the new or logical quoting system
by &quot;Harts Rules&quot; and the &quot;Oxford Dictionary
for Writers and Editors&quot;, is preferred practice in
Great Britain and hackers worldwide (see the Jargon File s
section on Hacker Writing Style,
http://www.fwi.uva.nl/~mes/jargon/h/HackerWrit-
ingStyle.html, for more information). Older documents
suggested inserting the prefix &quot;URL:&quot; just before
the URI, but this form has never caught on.</p>

<p>The URI syntax was designed to be unambiguous. However,
as URIs have become commonplace, traditional media
(television, radio, newspapers, billboards, etc.) have
increasingly used abbreviated URI references consisting of
only the authority and path portions of the identified
resource (e.g., &lt;www.w3.org/Addressing&gt;). Such
references are primar- ily intended for human interpretation
rather than machine, with the assumption that context-based
heuristics are sufficient to complete the URI (e.g.,
hostnames beginning with &quot;www&quot; are likely to have
a URI pre- fix of &quot;http://&quot; and hostnames
beginning with &quot;ftp&quot; likely to have a prefix of
&quot;ftp://&quot;). Many client implementations
heuristically resolve these references. Such heuristics may
change over time, particularly when new schemes are
introduced. Since an abbreviated URI has the same syntax as
a relative URL path, abbreviated URI references cannot be
used where relative URIs are permitted, and can only be used
when there is no defined base (such as in dialog boxes).
Dont use abbreviated URIs as hypertext links inside a
document; use the standard format as described here.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt (IETF
RFC 2396), http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40 (HTML 4.0).</p>

<p>NOTES Any tool accepting URIs (e.g., a web browser) on a
Linux system should be able to handle (directly or
indirectly) all of the schemes described here, including the
man: and info: schemes. Handling them by invoking some other
program is fine and in fact encouraged.</p>

<p>Technically the fragment isnt part of the URI.</p>

<p>For information on how to embed URIs (including URLs) in
a data format, see documentation on that format. HTML uses
the format &lt;A HREF=&quot;uri&quot;&gt; text &lt;/A&gt;.
Texinfo files use the format @uref{uri}. Man and mdoc have
the recently added UR macro, or just include the URI in the
text (view- ers should be able to detect :// as part of a
URI).</p>

<p>The GNOME and KDE desktop environments currently vary in
the URIs they accept, in particular in their respective help
browsers. To list man pages, GNOME uses &lt;toc:man&gt;
while KDE uses &lt;man:(index)&gt;, and to list info pages,
GNOME uses &lt;toc:info&gt; while KDE uses
&lt;info:(dir)&gt; (the author of this man page prefers the
KDE approach here, though a more regular format would be
even better). In general, KDE uses &lt;file:/cgi- bin/&gt;
as a prefix to a set of generated files. KDE prefers
documenta- tion in HTML, accessed via the
&lt;file:/cgi-bin/helpindex&gt;. GNOME prefers the ghelp
scheme to store and find documentation. Neither browser
handles file: references to directories at the time of this
writing, making it difficult to refer to an entire directory
with a browsable URI. As noted above, these environments
differ in how they handle the info: scheme, probably the
most important variation. It is expected that GNOME and KDE
will converge to common URI formats, and a future version of
this man page will describe the converged result. Efforts to
aid this convergence are encouraged.</p>

<p>Security A URI does not in itself pose a security
threat. There is no general guarantee that a URL, which at
one time located a given resource, will continue to do so.
Nor is there any guarantee that a URL will not locate a
different resource at some later point in time; such a
guaran- tee can only be obtained from the person(s)
controlling that namespace and the resource in question.</p>

<p>It is sometimes possible to construct a URL such that an
attempt to perform a seemingly harmless operation, such as
the retrieval of an entity associated with the resource,
will in fact cause a possibly dam- aging remote operation to
occur. The unsafe URL is typically con- structed by
specifying a port number other than that reserved for the
network protocol in question. The client unwittingly
contacts a site that is in fact running a different
protocol. The content of the URL contains instructions that,
when interpreted according to this other protocol, cause an
unexpected operation. An example has been the use of a
gopher URL to cause an unintended or impersonating message
to be sent via a SMTP server.</p>

<p>Caution should be used when using any URL that specifies
a port number other than the default for the protocol,
especially when it is a number within the reserved
space.</p>

<p>Care should be taken when a URI contains escaped
delimiters for a given protocol (for example, CR and LF
characters for telnet protocols) that these are not
unescaped before transmission. This might violate the
protocol, but avoids the potential for such characters to be
used to simulate an extra operation or parameter in that
protocol, which might lead to an unexpected and possibly
harmful remote operation to be per- formed.</p>

<p>It is clearly unwise to use a URI that contains a
password which is intended to be secret. In particular, the
use of a password within the &quot;userinfo&quot; component
of a URI is strongly recommended against except in those
rare cases where the &quot;password&quot; parameter is
intended to be pub- lic.</p>

<p>BUGS Documentation may be placed in a variety of
locations, so there cur- rently isn t a good URI scheme for
general online documentation in arbitrary formats.
References of the form &lt;file:///usr/doc/ZZZ&gt; dont work
because different distributions and local installation
require- ments may place the files in different directories
(it may be in /usr/doc, or /usr/local/doc, or /usr/share, or
somewhere else). Also, the directory ZZZ usually changes
when a version changes (though file- name globbing could
partially overcome this). Finally, using the file: scheme
doesnt easily support people who dynamically load
documentation from the Internet (instead of loading the
files onto a local file sys- tem). A future URI scheme may
be added (e.g., &quot;userdoc:&quot;) to permit programs to
include cross-references to more detailed documentation
without having to know the exact location of that
documentation. Alternatively, a future version of the
file-system specification may specify file locations
sufficiently so that the file: scheme will be able to locate
documentation.</p>

<p>Many programs and file formats dont include a way to
incorporate or implement links using URIs.</p>

<p>Many programs cant handle all of these different URI
formats; there should be a standard mechanism to load an
arbitrary URI that automati- cally detects the users
environment (e.g., text or graphics, desktop environment,
local user preferences, and currently executing tools) and
invokes the right tool for any URI.</p>
