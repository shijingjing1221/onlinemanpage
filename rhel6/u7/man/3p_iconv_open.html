<p>ICONV_OPEN(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
ICONV_OPEN(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME iconv_open - codeset conversion allocation
function</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;iconv.h&gt;</p>

<p>iconv_t iconv_open(const char *tocode, const char
*fromcode);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The iconv_open() function shall return a
conversion descriptor that describes a conversion from the
codeset specified by the string pointed to by the fromcode
argument to the codeset specified by the string pointed to
by the tocode argument. For state-dependent encodings, the
conversion descriptor shall be in a codeset-dependent
initial shift state, ready for immediate use with
iconv().</p>

<p>Settings of fromcode and tocode and their permitted
combinations are implementation-defined.</p>

<p>A conversion descriptor shall remain valid until it is
closed by iconv_close() or an implicit close.</p>

<p>If a file descriptor is used to implement conversion
descriptors, the FD_CLOEXEC flag shall be set; see
&lt;fcntl.h&gt;.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, iconv_open()
shall return a conversion descriptor for use on subsequent
calls to iconv(). Otherwise, iconv_open() shall return
(iconv_t)-1 and set errno to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The iconv_open() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EMFILE {OPEN_MAX} file descriptors are currently open in
the calling process.</p>

<p>ENFILE Too many files are currently open in the
system.</p>

<p>ENOMEM Insufficient storage space is available.</p>

<p>EINVAL The conversion specified by fromcode and tocode
is not supported by the implementation.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE Some implementations of iconv_open()
use malloc() to allocate space for internal buffer areas.
The iconv_open() function may fail if there is insufficient
storage space to accommodate these buffers.</p>

<p>Conforming applications must assume that conversion
descriptors are not valid after a call to one of the exec
functions.</p>

<p>Application developers should consult the system
documentation to determine the supported codesets and their
naming schemes.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
