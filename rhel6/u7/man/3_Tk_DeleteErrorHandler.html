<p>Tk_CreateErrorHandler(3) Tk Library Procedures
Tk_CreateErrorHandler(3)</p>


<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME Tk_CreateErrorHandler, Tk_DeleteErrorHandler -
handle X protocol errors</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tk.h&gt;</p>

<p>Tk_ErrorHandler Tk_CreateErrorHandler(display, error,
request, minor, proc, clientData)</p>

<p>Tk_DeleteErrorHandler(handler)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS Display *display (in) Display whose errors are
to be handled.</p>

<p>int error (in) Match only error events with this value
in the error_code field. If -1, then match any error_code
value.</p>

<p>int request (in) Match only error events with this value
in the request_code field. If -1, then match any
request_code value.</p>

<p>int minor (in) Match only error events with this value
in the minor_code field. If -1, then match any minor_code
value.</p>

<p>Tk_ErrorProc *proc (in) Procedure to invoke whenever an
error event is received for display and matches error,
request, and minor. NULL means ignore any matching
errors.</p>

<p>ClientData clientData (in) Arbitrary one-word value to
pass to proc.</p>

<p>Tk_ErrorHandler handler (in) Token for error handler to
delete (return value from a previous call to Tk_CreateEr-
rorHandler).
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Tk_CreateErrorHandler arranges for a
particular procedure (proc) to be called whenever certain
protocol errors occur on a particular display (display).
Protocol errors occur when the X protocol is used incor-
rectly, such as attempting to map a window that does not
exist. See the Xlib documentation for XSetErrorHandler for
more information on the kinds of errors that can occur. For
proc to be invoked to handle a particular error, five things
must occur:</p>

<p>[1] The error must pertain to display.</p>

<p>[2] Either the error argument to Tk_CreateErrorHandler
must have been -1, or the error argument must match the
error_code field from the error event.</p>

<p>[3] Either the request argument to Tk_CreateErrorHandler
must have been -1, or the request argument must match the
request_code field from the error event.</p>

<p>[4] Either the minor argument to Tk_CreateErrorHandler
must have been -1, or the minor argument must match the
minor_code field from the error event.</p>

<p>[5] The protocol request to which the error pertains
must have been made when the handler was active (see below
for more informa- tion).</p>

<p>Proc should have arguments and result that match the
following type: typedef int Tk_ErrorProc( ClientData
clientData, XErrorEvent *errEventPtr); The clientData
parameter to proc is a copy of the clientData argument given
to Tcl_CreateErrorHandler when the callback was created.
Typi- cally, clientData points to a data structure
containing application- specific information that is needed
to deal with the error. ErrEventPtr is a pointer to the X
error event. The procedure proc should return an integer
value. If it returns 0 it means that proc handled the error
completely and there is no need to take any other action for
the error. If it returns non-zero it means proc was unable
to handle the error.</p>

<p>If a value of NULL is specified for proc, all matching
errors will be ignored: this will produce the same result as
if a procedure had been specified that always returns 0.</p>

<p>If more than more than one handler matches a particular
error, then they are invoked in turn. The handlers will be
invoked in reverse order of creation: most recently declared
handler first. If any han- dler returns 0, then subsequent
(older) handlers will not be invoked. If no handler returns
0, then Tk invokes X s default error handler, which prints
an error message and aborts the program. If you wish to have
a default handler that deals with errors that no other
handler can deal with, then declare it first.</p>

<p>The X documentation states that the error handler should
not call any functions (directly or indirectly) on the
display that will generate protocol requests or that will
look for input events. This restric- tion applies to
handlers declared by Tk_CreateErrorHandler; disobey it at
your own risk.</p>

<p>Tk_DeleteErrorHandler may be called to delete a
previously-created error handler. The handler argument
identifies the error handler, and should be a value returned
by a previous call to Tk_CreateEventHandler.</p>

<p>A particular error handler applies to errors resulting
from protocol requests generated between the call to
Tk_CreateErrorHandler and the call to Tk_DeleteErrorHandler.
However, the actual callback to proc may not occur until
after the Tk_DeleteErrorHandler call, due to buffering in
the client and server. If an error event pertains to a
protocol request made just before calling
Tk_DeleteErrorHandler, then the error event may not have
been processed before the Tk_DeleteEr- rorHandler call. When
this situation arises, Tk will save information about the
handler and invoke the handler s proc later when the error
event finally arrives. If an application wishes to delete an
error handler and know for certain that all relevant errors
have been pro- cessed, it should first call
Tk_DeleteErrorHandler and then call XSync; this will flush
out any buffered requests and errors, but will result in a
performance penalty because it requires communication to and
from the X server. After the XSync call Tk is guaranteed not
to call any error handlers deleted before the XSync
call.</p>

<p>For the Tk error handling mechanism to work properly, it
is essential that application code never calls
XSetErrorHandler directly; applica- tions should use only
Tk_CreateErrorHandler.</p>
