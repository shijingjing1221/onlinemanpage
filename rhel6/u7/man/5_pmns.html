<p>NAME pmns - the performance metrics name space</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS $PCP_VAR_DIR/pmns</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION When using the Performance Metrics
Programming Interface (PMAPI) of the Performance Co-Pilot
(PCP), performance metrics are identified by an external
name in a hierarchic Performance Metrics Name Space (PMNS),
and an internal identifier, the Performance Metric
Identifier (PMID).</p>

<p>A PMNS specifies the association between a metric s name
and its PMID.</p>

<p>A PMNS is defined on one or more ASCII source files.</p>

<p>Loading of a PMNS is done by calling pmLoadNameSpace(3)
or pmLoadASCI- INameSpace(3).</p>

<p>As of Version 3.10.3 of PCP, by default duplicate names
for the same PMID are allowed in the PMNS, although
pmLoadASCIINameSpace(3) provides an alternative interface
with user-defined control over the processing of duplicate
names in the PMNS. The external format for a PMNS con- forms
to the syntax and semantics described in the following
sections.</p>

<p>There is one default PMNS in the files below
$PCP_VAR_DIR/pmns, although users and application developers
are free to create and use alternate PMNSs. For an example
of this, see the PCP Tutorial in
$PCP_DEMOS_DIR/Tutorial.</p>

<p>Although an application can call pmLoadNameSpace(3),
normally this is only done directly for the -n command line
option where an explicit root PMNS file is specified. Since
PCP version 2 uses a distributed PMNS (see below), an
application can extract PMNS information from a hosts PMCD
or an archive. If the PMNS source is a version 1 archive
(see PCPIntro(1)), however, then the local PMNS will be
loaded using the path specified by the environment variable
PMNS_DEFAULT.</p>

<p>DISTRIBUTED PMNS In PCP version 1, the PMNS functions in
the API all operated on a PMNS loaded locally from a file.
Since PCP version 2, however, PMNS func- tions may get the
PMNS information remotely from a PMCD or directly from the
meta data of an archive.</p>

<p>PROCESSING FRAMEWORK The PMNS specification is initially
passed through pmcpp(1). This means the following facilities
may be used in the specification</p>

<p>+ C-style comments</p>

<p>+ #include directives</p>

<p>+ #define directives and macro substitution</p>

<p>+ conditional processing via #ifdef ... #endif, etc.</p>

<p>When pmcpp(1) is executed, the standard include
directories are the current directory and
$PCP_VAR_DIR/pmns.</p>

<p>SYNTAX The general syntax for a non-leaf node in the
PMNS is as follows</p>

<p>pathname { name [pmid] ... }</p>

<p>Where pathname is the full pathname from the root of the
PMNS to this non-leaf node, with each component in the
pathname separated by a .. The root node for the PMNS must
have the special name root, but the common prefix root. must
be omitted from all pathnames. Each component in the
pathname must begin with an alphabetic character, and be
followed by zero or more characters drawn from the
alphabetics, the digits and the underscore _ ) character.
For alphabetic charac- ters in a pathname component, upper
and lower case are distinguished.</p>

<p>Non-leaf nodes in the PMNS may be defined in any
order.</p>

<p>The descendent nodes are defined by the set of names,
relative to the pathname of their parent non-leaf node. For
the descendent nodes, leaf nodes have a pmid specification,
non-leaf nodes do not. The syntax for the pmid specification
has been chosen to help manage the allocation of PMIDs
across disjoint and autonomous domains of administration and
implementation. Each pmid consists of 3 integer parts,
separated by colons, e.g. 14:27:11. This hierarchic
numbering scheme is intended to mirror the implementation
hierarchy of performance metric domain, met- rics cluster
(data structure or operational similarity) and individual
metric. In practice, the two leading components are likely
to be macros in the PMNS specification source, and pmcpp(1)
will convert the macros to integers. These macros for the
initial components of the pmid are likely to be defined
either in a standard include file, e.g.
$PCP_VAR_DIR/pmns/stdpmid, or in the current source
file.</p>

<p>To support dynamic metrics, where the existence of a
metric is known to a PMDA, but not visible in the PMNS, a
variant syntax for the pmid is supported, namely a domain
number followed by asterisks for the other components of the
pmid, e.g. 14:*:*. The corresponding metric name forms the
root of a subtree of dynamic metric names defined in the
cor- responding PMDA as identified by the domain number.</p>

<p>The current allocation of the high-order (PMD or domain)
component of PMIDs is as follows.</p>
