<p>NAME error::pass2 - systemtap pass-2 errors</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Errors that occur during pass 2
(elaboration) can have a variety of causes. Common types
include:</p>

<p>unavailable probe point classes Some types of probe
points are only available on certain system versions,
architectures, and configurations. For example, user- space
process.* probes may require utrace or uprobes capability in
the kernel for this architecture.</p>

<p>unavailable probe points Some probe points may be
individually unavailable even when their class is fine. For
example, kprobe.function(&quot;foobar&quot;) may fail if
function foobar does not exist in the kernel any more.
Debugging or symbol data may be absent for some types of
.func- tion or .statement probes; check for availability of
debuginfo. Try the stap-prep program to download
possibly-required debug- info. Use a wildcard parameter such
as stap -l _ kprobe.func- tion(&quot;*foo*&quot;)_ to locate
still-existing variants. Use ! or ? probe point suffixes to
denote optional / preferred-alterna- tives, to let the
working parts of a script continue.</p>

<p>typos There might be a spelling error in the probe point
name (&quot;syc- sall&quot; vs. &quot;syscall&quot;).
Wildcard probes may not find a match at all in the tapsets.
Recheck the names using stap -l PROBEPOINT. Another common
mistake is to use the . operator instead of the correct
-&gt; when dereferencing context variable subfields or
pointers: $foo-&gt;bar-&gt;baz even if in C one would say
foo-&gt;bar.baz.</p>

<p>unavailable context variables Systemtap scripts often
wish to refer to variables from the con- text of the probed
programs using $variable notation. These variables may not
always be available, depending on versions of the compiler,
debugging/optimization flags used, architecture, etc. Use
stap -L PROBEPOINT to list available context variables for
given probes. Use the @defined() expression to test for the
resolvability of a context variable expression. Consider
using the stap --skip-badvars option to silently replace
misbehaving context variable expressions with zero.</p>

<p>module cache inconsistencies Occasionally, the systemtap
module cache ($HOME/.system- tap/cache) might contain
obsolete information from a prior sys- tem
configuration/version, and produce false results as system-
tap attempts to reuse it. Retrying with stap --poison-cache
... forces new information to be generated. Note: this
should not happen and likely represents a systemtap bug.
Please report it.</p>

<p>GATHERING MORE INFORMATION Increasing the verbosity of
pass-2 with an option such as --vp 02 can help pinpoint the
problem.</p>
