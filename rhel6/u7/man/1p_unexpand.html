<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME unexpand - convert spaces to tabs</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS unexpand [ -a| -t tablist][file...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The unexpand utility shall copy files or
standard input to standard output, converting &lt;blank&gt;s
at the beginning of each line into the max- imum number of
&lt;tab&gt;s followed by the minimum number of
&lt;space&gt;s needed to fill the same column positions
originally filled by the translated &lt;blank&gt;s. By
default, tabstops shall be set at every eighth column
position. Each &lt;backspace&gt; shall be copied to the
output, and shall cause the column position count for tab
calculations to be decremented; the count shall never be
decremented to a value less than one.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The unexpand utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>The following options shall be supported:</p>

<p>-a In addition to translating &lt;blank&gt;s at the
beginning of each line, translate all sequences of two or
more &lt;blank&gt;s immedi- ately preceding a tab stop to
the maximum number of &lt;tab&gt;s fol- lowed by the minimum
number of &lt;space&gt;s needed to fill the same column
positions originally filled by the translated
&lt;blank&gt;s.</p>

<p>-t tablist Specify the tab stops. The application shall
ensure that the tablist option-argument is a single argument
consisting of a single positive decimal integer or multiple
positive decimal integers, separated by &lt;blank&gt;s or
commas, in ascending order. If a single number is given,
tabs shall be set tablist column positions apart instead of
the default 8. If multiple numbers are given, the tabs shall
be set at those specific column posi- tions.</p>

<p>The application shall ensure that each tab-stop position
N is an inte- ger value greater than zero, and the list
shall be in strictly ascend- ing order. This is taken to
mean that, from the start of a line of out- put, tabbing to
position N shall cause the next character output to be in
the ( N+1)th column position on that line. When the -t
option is not specified, the default shall be the equivalent
of specifying -t 8 (except for the interaction with -a,
described below).</p>

<p>No &lt;space&gt;-to- &lt;tab&gt; conversions shall occur
for characters at posi- tions beyond the last of those
specified in a multiple tab-stop list.</p>

<p>When -t is specified, the presence or absence of the -a
option shall be ignored; conversion shall not be limited to
the processing of leading &lt;blank&gt;s.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p>file A pathname of a text file to be used as input.</p>

<p>STDIN See the INPUT FILES section.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES The input files shall be text files.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of unex- pand:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments
and input files), the processing of &lt;tab&gt;s and
&lt;space&gt;s, and for the determination of the width in
column positions each character would occupy on an output
device.</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT The standard output shall be equivalent to the
input files with the specified &lt;space&gt;-to- &lt;tab&gt;
conversions.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 Successful completion.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE One non-intuitive aspect of unexpand
is its restriction to leading spaces when neither -a nor -t
is specified. Users who always want to convert all spaces in
a file can easily alias unexpand to use the -a or -t 8
option.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE On several occasions, consideration was given
to adding a -t option to the unexpand utility to complement
the -t in expand (see expand ). The historical intent of
unexpand was to translate multiple &lt;blank&gt;s into tab
stops, where tab stops were a multiple of eight column
positions on most UNIX systems. An early proposal omitted -t
because it seemed out- side the scope of the User
Portability Utilities option; it was not described in any of
the base documents. However, hard-coding tab stops every
eight columns was not suitable for the international
community and broke historical precedents for some vendors
in the FORTRAN commu- nity, so -t was restored in
conjunction with the list of valid exten- sion categories
considered by the standard developers. Thus, unexpand is now
the logical converse of expand.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
