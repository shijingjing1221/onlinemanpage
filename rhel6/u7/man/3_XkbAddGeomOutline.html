<p>XkbAddGeomOutline(3) XKB FUNCTIONS
XkbAddGeomOutline(3)</p>

<p>NAME XkbAddGeomOutline - Add one outline to an existing
shape</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS XkbOutlinePtr XkbAddGeomOutline (XkbShapePtr
shape, int sz_points);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS - shape shape to be updated</p>

<p>- sz_points number of points to be reserved</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Xkb provides functions to add a single new
element to the top-level keyboard geometry. In each case the
num_ * fields of the corresponding structure is incremented
by 1. These functions do not change sz_* unless there is no
more room in the array. Some of these functions fill in the
values of the element s structure from the arguments. For
other functions, you must explicitly write code to fill the
structures ele- ments.</p>

<p>The top-level geometry description includes a list of
geometry proper- ties. A geometry property associates an
arbitrary string with an equally arbitrary name. Programs
that display images of keyboards can use geometry properties
as hints, but they are not interpreted by Xkb. No other
geometry structures refer to geometry properties.</p>

<p>An outline consists of an arbitrary number of points.
XkbAddGeomOut- line adds an outline to the specified shape
by reserving sz_points points for it. The new outline is
allocated and zeroed. XkbAddGeomOut- line returns NULL if
any of the parameters is empty or if it was not able to
allocate space. To allocate space for an arbitrary number of
outlines to a shape, use XkbAllocGeomOutlines.</p>

<p>STRUCTURES typedef struct _XkbOutline { unsigned short
num_points; / number of points in the outline */ unsigned
short sz_points; / size of the points array */ unsigned
short corner_radius; / draw corners as circles with this
radius */ XkbPointPtr points; / array of points defining the
outline */ } XkbOutlineRec, *XkbOutlinePtr;</p>
