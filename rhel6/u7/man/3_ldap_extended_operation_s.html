<p>LDAP_EXTENDED_OPERATION(3)
LDAP_EXTENDED_OPERATION(3)</p>

<p>NAME ldap_extended_operation, ldap_extended_operation_s
- Extends the LDAP operations to the LDAP server.</p>

<p>LIBRARY OpenLDAP LDAP (libldap, -lldap)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;ldap.h&gt;</p>

<p>int ldap_extended_operation( LDAP *ld, const char
*requestoid, const struct berval *requestdata, LDAPControl
**sctrls, LDAPControl **cctrls, int *msgidp );</p>

<p>int ldap_extended_operation_s( LDAP *ld, const char
*requestoid, const struct berval *requestdata, LDAPControl
**sctrls, LDAPControl **cctrls, char **retoidp, struct
berval **retdatap );</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The ldap_extended_operation_s() routine is
used to synchronously per- form an LDAP extended operation.
It takes requestoid, which points to a dotted-decimal OID
string identifying the extended operation to per- form.
requestdata is the data required for the request, sctrls is
an array of LDAPControl structures to use with this extended
operation, cctrls is an array of LDAPControl structures that
list the client con- trols to use with this extended
operation.</p>

<p>The output parameter retoidp points to a dotted-decimal
OID string returned by the LDAP server. The memory used by
the string should be freed with the ldap_memfree(3)
function. The output parameter retdatap points to a pointer
to a berval structure that contains the returned data. If no
data is returned by the server, the pointer is set this to
NULL. The memory used by this structure should be freed with
the ber_bvfree(3) function.</p>

<p>The ldap_extended_operation() works just like
ldap_extended_opera- tion_s(), but the operation is
asynchronous. It provides the message id of the request it
initiated in the integer pointed to be msgidp. The result of
this operation can be obtained by calling
ldap_result(3).</p>
