<p>virtd_selinux(8) SELinux Policy virtd
virtd_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME virtd_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for
the virtd processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the virtd
processes via flexible manda- tory access control.</p>

<p>The virtd processes execute with the virtd_t SELinux
type. You can check if you have these processes running by
executing the ps command with the -Z qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep virtd_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The virtd_t SELinux type can be entered via
the file_type, unlabeled_t, proc_type, virtd_exec_t,
filesystem_type, mtrr_device_t, sysctl_type file types.</p>

<p>The default entrypoint paths for the virtd_t domain are
the following:</p>

<p>all files on the system, /usr/sbin/libvirtd,
/usr/bin/imgfac.py, /usr/share/vdsm/vdsm,
/usr/bin/imagefactory, /usr/bin/nova-compute,
/usr/share/vdsm/respawn, /usr/sbin/condor_vm-gahp,
/usr/bin/vios-proxy- host, /usr/bin/vios-proxy-guest,
/usr/share/vdsm/supervdsmServer, /dev/cpu/mtrr</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux virtd policy is very flexible allowing users
to setup their virtd pro- cesses in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for virtd:</p>

<p>virt_qemu_ga_unconfined_t, virtd_lxc_t, virt_qmf_t,
virt_qemu_ga_t, virt_bridgehelper_t, virtd_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a virtd_t can be used to make
the process type virtd_t permissive. SELinux does not deny
access to permissive process types, but the AVC (SELinux
denials) messages are still gener- ated.</p>

<p>BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable based on least
access required. virtd policy is extremely flexible and has
several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and
run virtd with the tightest access possible.</p>

turn on the virt_use_nfs boolean. Disabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P virt_use_nfs 1</p>

turn on the virt_use_samba boolean. Disabled by default.</p>

<p>PORT TYPES SELinux defines port types to represent TCP
and UDP ports.</p>

<p>You can see the types associated with a port by using
the following command:</p>

<p>semanage port -l</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these ports. SELinux virtd policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their virtd processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>The following port types are defined for virtd:</p>

<p>virt_migration_port_t</p>

<p>Default Defined Ports: tcp 49152-49216</p>

<p>virt_port_t</p>

<p>Default Defined Ports: tcp 16509,16514 udp
16509,16514</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type virtd_t can
manage files labeled with the fol- lowing file types. The
paths listed are the default paths for these file types.
Note the processes UID still need to have DAC
permissions.</p>

<p>file_type</p>

<p>all files on the system</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux virtd policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their virtd processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>STANDARD FILE CONTEXT</p>

<p>SELinux defines the file context types for the virtd, if
you wanted to store files with these types in a diffent
paths, you need to execute the semanage command to sepecify
alternate labeling and then use restorecon to put the labels
on disk.</p>

<p>semanage fcontext -a -t virtd_keytab_t
/srv/myvirtd_content(/.*)? restorecon -R -v
/srv/myvirtd_content</p>

<p>Note: SELinux often uses regular expressions to specify
labels that match multiple files.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for virtd:</p>

<p>virtd_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the virtd_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the virtd_t domain.</p>

<p>Paths: /usr/sbin/libvirtd, /usr/bin/imgfac.py,
/usr/share/vdsm/vdsm, /usr/bin/imagefactory,
/usr/bin/nova-compute, /usr/share/vdsm/respawn,
/usr/sbin/condor_vm-gahp, /usr/bin/vios- proxy-host,
/usr/bin/vios-proxy-guest, /usr/share/vdsm/supervdsm-
Server</p>

<p>virtd_initrc_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the virtd_initrc_exec_t type, if you
want to transi- tion an executable to the virtd_initrc_t
domain.</p>

<p>virtd_keytab_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the virtd_keytab_t type, if you want to
treat the files as kerberos keytab files.</p>

<p>virtd_lxc_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the virtd_lxc_exec_t type, if you want
to transition an executable to the virtd_lxc_t domain.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage port can also be used to manipulate the port
definitions</p>

<p>semanage boolean can also be used to manipulate the
booleans</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
