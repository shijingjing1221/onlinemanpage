<p>SENDMAIL(1) SENDMAIL(1)</p>

<p>NAME sendmail - Postfix to Sendmail compatibility
interface</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sendmail [option ...] [recipient ...]</p>

<p>mailq sendmail -bp</p>

<p>newaliases sendmail -I</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The Postfix sendmail(1) command implements
the Postfix to Sendmail com- patibility interface. For the
sake of compatibility with existing applications, some
Sendmail command-line options are recognized but silently
ignored.</p>

<p>By default, Postfix sendmail(1) reads a message from
standard input until EOF or until it reads a line with only
a . character, and arranges for delivery. Postfix
sendmail(1) relies on the postdrop(1) command to create a
queue file in the maildrop directory.</p>

<p>Specific command aliases are provided for other common
modes of opera- tion:</p>

<p>mailq List the mail queue. Each entry shows the queue
file ID, message size, arrival time, sender, and the
recipients that still need to be delivered. If mail could
not be delivered upon the last attempt, the reason for
failure is shown. The queue ID string is followed by an
optional status character:</p>

<p>* The message is in the active queue, i.e. the message
is selected for delivery.</p>

<p>! The message is in the hold queue, i.e. no further
deliv- ery attempt will be made until the mail is taken off
hold.</p>

<p>This mode of operation is implemented by executing the
postqueue(1) command.</p>

<p>newaliases Initialize the alias database. If no input
file is specified (with the -oA option, see below), the
program processes the file(s) specified with the
alias_database configuration parame- ter. If no alias
database type is specified, the program uses the type
specified with the default_database_type configuration
parameter. This mode of operation is implemented by running
the postalias(1) command.</p>

<p>Note: it may take a minute or so before an alias
database update becomes visible. Use the &quot;postfix
reload&quot; command to eliminate this delay.</p>

<p>These and other features can be selected by specifying
the appropriate combination of command-line options. Some
features are controlled by parameters in the main.cf
configuration file.</p>

<p>The following options are recognized:</p>

<p>-Am (ignored)</p>

<p>-Ac (ignored) Postfix sendmail uses the same
configuration file regardless of whether or not a message is
an initial submission.</p>

<p>-B body_type The message body MIME type: 7BIT or
8BITMIME.</p>

<p>-bd Go into daemon mode. This mode of operation is
implemented by executing the &quot;postfix start&quot;
command.</p>

<p>-bh (ignored)</p>

<p>-bH (ignored) Postfix has no persistent host status
database.</p>

<p>-bi Initialize alias database. See the newaliases
command above.</p>

<p>-bm Read mail from standard input and arrange for
delivery. This is the default mode of operation.</p>

<p>-bp List the mail queue. See the mailq command
above.</p>

<p>-bs Stand-alone SMTP server mode. Read SMTP commands
from standard input, and write responses to standard output.
In stand-alone SMTP server mode, mail relaying and other
access controls are disabled by default. To enable them, run
the process as the mail_owner user.</p>

<p>This mode of operation is implemented by running the
smtpd(8) daemon.</p>

<p>-bv Do not collect or deliver a message. Instead, send
an email report after verifying each recipient address. This
is useful for testing address rewriting and routing
configurations.</p>

<p>This feature is available in Postfix version 2.1 and
later.</p>

<p>-C config_file</p>

<p>-C config_dir The path name of the Postfix main.cf file,
or of its parent directory. This information is ignored with
Postfix versions before 2.3.</p>

<p>With all Postfix versions, you can specify a directory
pathname with the MAIL_CONFIG environment variable to
override the loca- tion of configuration files.</p>

<p>-F full_name Set the sender full name. This overrides
the NAME environment variable, and is used only with
messages that have no From: mes- sage header.</p>

<p>-f sender Set the envelope sender address. This is the
address where delivery problems are sent to. With Postfix
versions before 2.1, the Errors-To: message header overrides
the error return address.</p>

<p>-G Gateway (relay) submission, as opposed to initial
user submis- sion. Either do not rewrite addresses at all,
or update incom- plete addresses with the domain information
specified with remote_header_rewrite_domain.</p>

<p>This option is ignored before Postfix version 2.3.</p>

<p>-h hop_count (ignored) Hop count limit. Use the
hopcount_limit configuration parameter instead.</p>

<p>-I Initialize alias database. See the newaliases command
above.</p>

<p>-i When reading a message from standard input,
don&acute;t treat a line with only a . character as the end
of input.</p>

<p>-L label (ignored) The logging label. Use the
syslog_name configuration parameter instead.</p>

<p>-m (ignored) Backwards compatibility.</p>

<p>-N dsn (default: delay, failure) Delivery status
notification control. Specify either a comma- separated list
with one or more of failure (send notification when delivery
fails), delay (send notification when delivery is delayed),
or success (send notification when the message is
delivered); or specify never (don t send any notifications
at all).</p>

<p>This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.</p>

<p>-n (ignored) Backwards compatibility.</p>

<p>-oAalias_database Non-default alias database. Specify
pathname or type:pathname. See postalias(1) for details.</p>

<p>-O option=value (ignored) Backwards compatibility.</p>

<p>-o7 (ignored)</p>

<p>-o8 (ignored) To send 8-bit or binary content, use an
appropriate MIME encap- sulation and specify the appropriate
-B command-line option.</p>

<p>-oi When reading a message from standard input,
don&acute;t treat a line with only a . character as the end
of input.</p>

<p>-om (ignored) The sender is never eliminated from alias
etc. expansions.</p>

<p>-o x value (ignored) Set option x to value. Use the
equivalent configuration parame- ter in main.cf instead.</p>

<p>-r sender Set the envelope sender address. This is the
address where delivery problems are sent to. With Postfix
versions before 2.1, the Errors-To: message header overrides
the error return address.</p>

<p>-R return_limit (ignored) Limit the size of bounced
mail. Use the bounce_size_limit con- figuration parameter
instead.</p>

<p>-q Attempt to deliver all queued mail. This is
implemented by exe- cuting the postqueue(1) command.</p>

<p>Warning: flushing undeliverable mail frequently will
result in poor delivery performance of all other mail.</p>

<p>-qinterval (ignored) The interval between queue runs.
Use the queue_run_delay config- uration parameter
instead.</p>

<p>-qIqueueid Schedule immediate delivery of mail with the
specified queue ID. This option is implemented by executing
the postqueue(1) com- mand, and is available with Postfix
version 2.4 and later.</p>

<p>-qRsite Schedule immediate delivery of all mail that is
queued for the named site. This option accepts only site
names that are eligible for the &quot;fast flush&quot;
service, and is implemented by executing the postqueue(1)
command. See flush(8) for more information about the
&quot;fast flush&quot; service.</p>

<p>-qSsite This command is not implemented. Use the slower
&quot;sendmail -q&quot; command instead.</p>

<p>-t Extract recipients from message headers. These are
added to any recipients specified on the command line.</p>

<p>With Postfix versions prior to 2.1, this option requires
that no recipient addresses are specified on the command
line.</p>

<p>-U (ignored) Initial user submission.</p>

<p>-V envid Specify the envelope ID for notification by
servers that support DSN.</p>

<p>This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.</p>

<p>-XV (Postfix 2.2 and earlier: -V) Variable Envelope
Return Path. Given an envelope sender address of the form
owner-listname@origin, each recipient user@domain receives
mail with a personalized envelope sender address.</p>

<p>By default, the personalized envelope sender address is
owner- listname+user=domain@origin. The default + and =
characters are configurable with the default_verp_delimiters
configuration parameter.</p>

<p>-XVxy (Postfix 2.2 and earlier: -Vxy) As -XV, but uses x
and y as the VERP delimiter characters, instead of the
characters specified with the default_verp_delim- iters
configuration parameter.</p>

<p>-v Send an email report of the first delivery attempt
(Postfix ver- sions 2.1 and later). Mail delivery always
happens in the back- ground. When multiple -v options are
given, enable verbose log- ging for debugging purposes.</p>

<p>-X log_file (ignored) Log mailer traffic. Use the
debug_peer_list and debug_peer_level configuration
parameters instead.</p>

<p>SECURITY By design, this program is not set-user (or
group) id. However, it must handle data from untrusted,
possibly remote, users. Thus, the usual precautions need to
be taken against malicious inputs.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS Problems are logged to syslogd(8) and to the
standard error stream.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT MAIL_CONFIG Directory with Postfix
configuration files.</p>

<p>MAIL_VERBOSE (value does not matter) Enable verbose
logging for debugging purposes.</p>

<p>MAIL_DEBUG (value does not matter) Enable debugging with
an external command, as specified with the debugger_command
configuration parameter.</p>
