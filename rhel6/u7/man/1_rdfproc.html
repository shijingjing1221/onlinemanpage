<p>NAME rdfproc - Redland RDF processor utility</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rdfproc [options] store-name command arg...</p>

<p>EXAMPLE rdfproc test parse
http://planetrdf.com/guide/rss.rdf rdfproc test print
rdfproc test serialize ntriples</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The rdfproc utility allows parsing,
querying, manipulating and serial- izing of RDF content
using the Redland RDF library. The store-name is a Redland
store name, typically a short identifier. The arguments to
command vary and are explained in section COMMANDS
below.</p>

<p>OPTIONS rdfproc uses the usual GNU command line syntax,
with long options starting with two dashes ( - ) if
supported by the getopt_long func- tion. Otherwise the short
options are only available.</p>

<p>-h, --help Show a summary of the options.</p>

<p>-c, --contexts Use a store with Redland contexts.</p>

<p>-n, --new Make a new store, overwriting any existing
one.</p>

<p>-o, --output FORMAT Set the output FORMAT for sequences
of triples, such as from a search (find command) to a
Redland serializer. At present the alternatives are simple
(the default one if this option is omitted), ntriples or
rdfxml.</p>

<p>-p, --password Read the storage option password from
standard input. Termi- ) or end of file. This is equivalent
nated by end of line (0 to setting it using -t or
--storage-options but does not require exposing the password
in the argument list.</p>

<p>-r, --results FORMAT Set the query results syntax
format.</p>

<p>The exact list of formats depends on what libraptor(3)
was built with but is given correct in the usage message
with -h.</p>

<p>-s, --storage TYPE Set the Redland storage type (default
hashes). Alternatives are memory which is always present and
3store, file, mysql , sqlite , uri when support for those is
compiled in If environment variable RDFPROC_STORAGE_TYPE is
set, the storage type given here will override it.</p>

<p>-t, --storage-options OPTIONS Set options for the the
Redland storage, default is &quot;hash- type=bdb,dir=.
&quot; to match the default storage &quot;hashes&quot;. For
storages types such as mysql that need extra options this
would typically be something like &quot;host=host- name
,database= dbname ,user= abc ,password= pass&quot;. If
environment variable RDFPROC_STORAGE_OPTIONS is set, the
storage options given here will be applied afterwards.</p>

<p>-v, --version Print the Redland version and exit.</p>

<p>COMMANDS Where a node is allowed, such as NODE, SUBJECT,
PREDICATE or OBJECT below, simple heuristics are used to
guess which are blank node identi- fiers, URIs or literals
(to add a statement with a literal, use add- typed). If the
item starts with _: then it is assumed to be a blank node
identifier, otherwise if it matches something:// it is
assumed to be a URI, otherwise it is a literal. Literals are
only allowed as objects of statements and blank nodes are
not allowed as predicates.</p>

<p>add SUBJECT PREDICATE OBJECT [CONTEXT] Add the given
triple to graph, in the optional Redland context if the
CONTEXT node is given.</p>

<p>add-typed SUBJECT PREDICATE OBJECT OBJECT-LANG
OBJECT-URI [CONTEXT] Add the triple with the datatyped
literal object to the graph, in the optional Redland context
if CONTEXT is given.</p>

<p>arc SUBJECT OBJECT</p>

<p>arcs SUBJECT OBJECT Show one node/all nodes that match
triples (SUBJECT, ?, OBJECT)</p>

<p>arcs-in NODE Show all properties of triples with NODE as
a subject.</p>

<p>arcs-out NODE Show all properties of triples with NODE
as an object.</p>

<p>contains SUBJECT PREDICATE OBJECT Check if the given
triple is in the graph.</p>

<p>contexts List all the contexts in the graph (if contexts
are enabled).</p>

<p>find SUBJECT|- PREDICATE|- OBJECT|- [CONTEXT] Find
matching triples to the given statement where - stands for a
blank that matches any node. If CONTEXT is given, only
search for triples in that context node.</p>

<p>has-arc-in NODE ARC Check that there is a triple with
NODE as a subject and ARC as a predicate.</p>

<p>has-arc-out NODE ARC Check that there is a triple with
NODE as a object and ARC as a predicate.</p>

<p>parse URI|FILENAME [SYNTAX| [BASE URI]] Parse syntax at
URI into the graph using SYNTAX which can be one of rdfxml
(RDF/XML, default), ntriples, turtle, rss-tag-soup (for all
RSS and Atoms), grddl and guess to use content hints and
protocol information to work it out. (This list changes
faster than this manual page) If FILENAME is a existing
file, the appropriate URI will be generated for it.</p>

<p>parse-stream URI|FILENAME [SYNTAX [BASE URI [CONTEXT]]
Streaming parse syntax at URI into the graph using SYNTAX
which can be one of rdfxml (RDF/XML, default) or ntriples.
If FILE- NAME is an existing file, the appropriate URI will
be generated for it. If the optional CONTEXT URI is given,
the triples are added to that context.</p>

<p>print Print the graph triples in a simple format showing
context nodes if present.</p>

<p>query NAME|- URI|- QUERY-STRING Run QUERY-STRING query
in language NAME returning variable bind- ings, a boolean or
RDF graph depending on the query. Query lan- guage can be
sparql or rdql.</p>

<p>remove SUBJECT PREDICATE OBJECT [CONTEXT] Remove the
given triple graph, in the optional Redland context if
CONTEXT is given.</p>

<p>remove-context CONTEXT Remove all triples in the graph
with the Redland context CON- TEXT.</p>

<p>serialize [SYNTAX [URI [MIME-TYPE]]] Serializes the
graph to a syntax with a particular ISYNTAX URI or Internet
Media Type/MIME Type. The default is RDF/XML (NAME
&quot;rdfxml&quot;, MIME Type
&quot;application/rdf/xml&quot;) if none of the above are
given. Other alternatives are &quot;ntriples&quot; (no MIME
Type).</p>

<p>source PREDICATE OBJECT</p>

<p>sources PREDICATE OBJECT Show one node/all nodes that
match triples (?, PREDICATE, OBJECT)</p>

<p>target SUBJECT PREDICATE</p>

<p>targets SUBJECT PREDICATE Show one node/all nodes that
match triples (SUBJECT, PREDICATE, ?)</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT RDFPROC_STORAGE_OPTIONS can be set to
provide storage options instead of using the option -t,
--storage-options OPTIONS. When both are given, command
options are applied last.</p>

<p>RDFPROC_STORAGE_TYPE can be set to provide a storage
type instead of using the option -s, --storage TYPE. When
both are given, the storage type from the command is
used.</p>
