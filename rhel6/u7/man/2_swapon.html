<p>SWAPON(2) Linux Programmer s Manual SWAPON(2)</p>

<p>NAME swapon, swapoff - start/stop swapping to
file/device</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt; #include
&lt;asm/page.h&gt; /* to find PAGE_SIZE */ #include
&lt;sys/swap.h&gt;</p>

<p>int swapon(const char *path, int swapflags); int
swapoff(const char *path);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION swapon() sets the swap area to the file or
block device specified by path. swapoff() stops swapping to
the file or block device specified by path.</p>

<p>swapon() takes a swapflags argument. If swapflags has
the SWAP_FLAG_PREFER bit turned on, the new swap area will
have a higher priority than default. The priority is encoded
within swapflags as:</p>

<p>(prio &lt;&lt; SWAP_FLAG_PRIO_SHIFT) &amp;
SWAP_FLAG_PRIO_MASK</p>

<p>These functions may only be used by a privileged process
(one having the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability).</p>

<p>Priority Each swap area has a priority, either high or
low. The default prior- ity is low. Within the low-priority
areas, newer areas are even lower priority than older
areas.</p>

<p>All priorities set with swapflags are high-priority,
higher than default. They may have any non-negative value
chosen by the caller. Higher numbers mean higher
priority.</p>

<p>Swap pages are allocated from areas in priority order,
highest priority first. For areas with different priorities,
a higher-priority area is exhausted before using a
lower-priority area. If two or more areas have the same
priority, and it is the highest priority available, pages
are allocated on a round-robin basis between them.</p>

<p>As of Linux 1.3.6, the kernel usually follows these
rules, but there are exceptions.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, zero is returned. On error, -1
is returned, and errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS EBUSY (for swapon()) The specified path is
already being used as a swap area.</p>

<p>EINVAL The file path exists, but refers neither to a
regular file nor to a block device; or, for swapon(), the
indicated path does not contain a valid swap signature or
resides on an in-memory file system like tmpfs; or, for
swapoff(), path is not currently a swap area.</p>

<p>ENFILE The system limit on the total number of open
files has been reached.</p>

<p>ENOENT The file path does not exist.</p>

<p>ENOMEM The system has insufficient memory to start
swapping.</p>

<p>EPERM The caller does not have the CAP_SYS_ADMIN
capability. Alterna- tively, the maximum number of swap
files are already in use; see NOTES below.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO These functions are Linux-specific and
should not be used in programs intended to be portable. The
second swapflags argument was introduced in Linux 1.3.2.</p>

<p>NOTES The partition or path must be prepared with
mkswap(8).</p>

<p>There is an upper limit on the number of swap files that
may be used, defined by the kernel constant MAX_SWAPFILES.
Before kernel 2.4.10, MAX_SWAPFILES has the value 8; since
kernel 2.4.10, it has the value 32. Since kernel 2.6.18, the
limit is decreased by 2 if the kernel is built with the
CONFIG_MIGRATION option (which reserves two swap table
entries for the page migration features of mbind(2) and
migrate_pages(2)). Since kernel 2.6.32, the limit is
decreased by 1 if the kernel is built with the
CONFIG_MEMORY_FAILURE option.</p>
