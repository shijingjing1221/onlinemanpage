<p>NAME compile_et - error table compiler</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS compile_et file</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Compile_et converts a table listing
error-code names and associated messages into a C source
file suitable for use with the com_err(3) library.</p>

<p>The source file name must end with a suffix of .et; the
file con- sists of a declaration supplying the name (up to
four characters long) of the error-code table:</p>

<p>error_table name</p>

<p>followed by up to 256 entries of the form:</p>

<p>error_code name, &quot; string &quot;</p>

<p>and a final</p>

<p>end</p>

<p>to indicate the end of the table.</p>

<p>The name of the table is used to construct the name of a
subroutine initialize_XXXX_error_table which must be called
in order for the com_err library to recognize the error
table.</p>

<p>The various error codes defined are assigned
sequentially increasing numbers (starting with a large
number computed as a hash function of the name of the
table); thus for compatibility it is suggested that new
codes be added only to the end of an existing table, and
that no codes be removed from tables.</p>

<p>The names defined in the table are placed into a C
header file with preprocessor directives defining them as
integer constants of up to 32 bits in magnitude.</p>

<p>A C source file is also generated which should be
compiled and linked with the object files which reference
these error codes; it contains the text of the messages and
the initialization subroutine. Both C files have names
derived from that of the original source file, with the .et
suffix replaced by .c and .h.</p>

<p>A # in the source file is treated as a comment
character, and all remaining text to the end of the source
line will be ignored.</p>

<p>BUGS Since the original compile_et uses a very simple
parser based on yacc(1), and this current version of
compile_et uses an awk/sed combi- nation of scripts, its
error recovery leaves much to be desired.</p>
