<p>Name xjc - Java(TM) Architecture for XML Binding Binding
Compiler</p>

<p>Specification Version: 2.1 Reference Implementation (RI)
Version: 2.1.3</p>

<p>Launching xjc The binding compiler can be launched using
the appropriate xjc shell script in the bin directory for
your platform. We also provide an Ant task to run the
binding complier - see the instructions for using the XJC
Ant task @
https://jaxb.dev.java.net/nonav/2.1.3/docs/xjcTask.html.</p>

<p>% xjc -help</p>

<p>Output Usage: xjc [-options ...] &lt;schema
file/URL/dir/jar&gt; ... [-b &lt;bindinfo&gt;] ... If dir is
specified, all schema files in it will be compiled. If jar
is specified, /META-INF/sun-jaxb.episode binding file will
be compiled. Options: -nv : do not perform strict validation
of the input schema(s) -extension : allow vendor extensions
- do not strictly follow the Compatibility Rules and App E.2
from the JAXB Spec -b &lt;file/dir&gt; : specify external
bindings files (each &lt;file&gt; must have its own -b); if
a directory is given, **/*.xjb is searched -d &lt;dir&gt; :
generated files will go into this directory -p &lt;pkg&gt; :
specifies the target package -httpproxy &lt;proxy&gt; : set
HTTP/HTTPS proxy; format is
[user[:password]@]proxyHost:proxyPort -httpproxyfile
&lt;f&gt; : works like -httpproxy but takes the argument in
a file to protect password -classpath &lt;arg&gt; : specify
where to find user class files -catalog &lt;file&gt; :
specify catalog files to resolve external entity references;
support TR9401, XCatalog, and OASIS XML Catalog format
-readOnly : generated files will be in read-only mode -npa :
suppress generation of package level annotations
(**/package-info.java) -no-header : suppress generation of a
file header with timestamp -target 2.0 : behave like XJC 2.0
and generate code that doesnt use any 2.1 features
-xmlschema : treat input as W3C XML Schema (default)
-relaxng : treat input as RELAX NG
(experimental,unsupported) -relaxng-compact : treat input as
RELAX NG compact syntax (experimental,unsupported) -dtd :
treat input as XML DTD (experimental,unsupported) -wsdl :
treat input as WSDL and compile schemas inside it
(experimental,unsupported) -verbose : be extra verbose
-quiet : suppress compiler output -help : display this help
message -version : display version information</p>

<p>Extensions: -Xlocator : enable source location support
for generated code -Xsync-methods : generate accessor
methods with the synchronizedkeyword -mark-generated : mark
the generated code as @javax.annotation.Generated -episode
&lt;FILE&gt; : generate the episode file for separate
compilation</p>

<p>OPTIONS -nv By default, the XJC binding compiler
performs strict validation of the source schema before
processing it. Use this option to disable strict schema
validation. This does not mean that the binding compiler
will not perform any validation, it simply means that it
will perform less-strict validation.</p>

<p>-extension By default, the XJC binding compiler strictly
enforces the rules outlined in the Compatibility chapter of
the JAXB Specification. Appendix E.2 defines a set of W3C
XML Schema features that are not completely supported by
JAXB v1.0. In some cases, you may be allowed to use them in
the &quot;-extension&quot; mode enabled by this switch. In
the default (strict) mode, you are also limited to using
only the binding customizations defined in the specifica-
tion. By using the &quot;-extension&quot; switch, you will
be allowed to use the JAXB Vendor Extensions</p>

<p>-b &lt;file&gt; Specify one or more external binding
files to process. (Each binding file must have its own
&quot;-b&quot; switch.) The syntax of the external binding
files is extremely flexible. You may have a sin- gle binding
file that contains customizations for multiple schemas or
you can break the customizations into multiple bind- ings
files: xjc schema1.xsd schema2.xsd schema3.xsd -b bind-
ings123.xjb xjc schema1.xsd schema2.xsd schema3.xsd -b
bindings1.xjb -b bind- ings2.xjb -b bindings3.xjb In
addition, the ordering of the schema files and binding files
on the command line does not mat- ter.</p>

<p>-d &lt;dir&gt; By default, the XJC binding compiler will
generate the Java con- tent classes in the current
directory. Use this option to specify an alternate output
directory. The output directory must already exist, the XJC
binding compiler will not create it for you.</p>

<p>-p &lt;pkg&gt; Specifying a target package via this
command-line option over- rides any binding customization
for package name and the default package name algorithm
defined in the specification.</p>

<p>-httpproxy &lt;proxy&gt; Specify the HTTP/HTTPS proxy.
The format is [user[:pass- word]@]proxyHost[:proxyPort]. The
old -host and -port are still supported by the RI for
backwards compatibility, but they have been deprecated. Note
that the password specified with this option is an argument
that is visible to other users who use the top command, for
example. For greater security, use -httpproxy- file,
below.</p>

<p>-httpproxyfile &lt;file&gt; Specify the HTTP/HTTPS proxy
using a file. Same format as above, but the password
specified in the file is not visible to other users.</p>

<p>-classpath &lt;arg&gt; Specify where to find client
application class files used by the &lt;jxb:javaType&gt; and
&lt;xjc:superClass&gt; customizations.</p>

<p>-catalog &lt;file&gt; Specify catalog files to resolve
external entity references. Sup- ports TR9401, XCatalog, and
OASIS XML Catalog format. Please read the XML Entity and URI
Resolvers document or the catalog-resolver sample
application.</p>

<p>-readOnly By default, the XJC binding compiler does not
write-protect the Java source files it generates. Use this
option to force the XJC binding compiler to mark the
generated Java sources read-only.</p>

<p>-npa Supress the generation of package level annotations
into **/pack- age-info.java. Using this switch causes the
generated code to internalize those annotations into the
other generated classes.</p>

<p>-no-header Supress the generation of a file header
comment that includes some note and timestamp. Using this
makes the generated code more diff-friendly.</p>

<p>-target 2.0 Avoid generating code that relies on any
JAXB 2.1 features. This will allow the generated code to run
with JAXB 2.0 runtime (such as JavaSE 6.)</p>

<p>-xmlschema Treat input schemas as W3C XML Schema
(default). If you do not specify this switch, your input
schemas will be treated as W3C XML Schema.</p>

<p>-relaxng Treat input schemas as RELAX NG (experimental,
unsupported). Sup- port for RELAX NG schemas is provided as
a JAXB Vendor Extension.</p>

<p>-relaxng-compact Treat input schemas as RELAX NG compact
syntax(experimental, unsupported). Support for RELAX NG
schemas is provided as a JAXB Vendor Extension.</p>

<p>-dtd Treat input schemas as XML DTD (experimental,
unsupported). Sup- port for RELAX NG schemas is provided as
a JAXB Vendor Extension.</p>

<p>-wsdl Treat input as WSDL and compile schemas inside it
(experimen- tal,unsupported).</p>

<p>-quiet Suppress compiler output, such as progress
information and warn- ings.</p>

<p>-verbose Be extra verbose, such as printing
informational messages or dis- playing stack traces upon
some errors.</p>

<p>-help Display a brief summary of the compiler
switches.</p>

<p>-version Display the compiler version information.</p>

<p>&lt;schema file/URL/dir&gt; Specify one or more schema
files to compile. If you specify a directory, then xjc will
scan it for all schema files and compile them.</p>

<p>Non-Standard Command Line Options -Xlocator Causes the
generated code to expose SAX Locator information about the
source XML in the Java bean instances after
unmarshalling.</p>

<p>-Xsync-methods Causes all of the generated method
signatures to include the syn- chronized keyword.</p>

<p>-mark-generated Mark the generated code with the
annotation @javax.annota- tion.Generated.</p>

<p>-episode &lt;file&gt; Generate the specified episode
file for separate compilation.</p>

<p>Deprecated and Removed Command Line Options -host &amp;
-port These options have been deprecated and replaced with
the -http- proxy option. For backwards compatibility, we
will continue to support these options, but they will no
longer be documented and may be removed from future
releases.</p>

<p>-use-runtime Since the JAXB 2.0 specification has
defined a portable runtime, it is no longer necessary for
the JAXB RI to generate **/impl/runtime packages. Therefore,
this switch is obsolete and has been removed.</p>

<p>-source The -source compatibility switch was introduced
in the first JAXB 2.0 Early Access release. We have decided
to remove this switch from future releases of JAXB 2.0. If
you need to generate 1.0.x code, please use an installation
of the 1.0.x codebase.</p>

<p>Compiler Restrictions In general, it is safest to
compile all related schemas as a single unit with the same
binding compiler switches.</p>

<p>Please keep the following list of restrictions in mind
when running xjc. Most of these issues only apply when
compiling multiple schemas with multiple invocations of
xjc.</p>

<p>o To compile multiple schemas at the same time, keep the
following precedence rules for the target Java package name
in mind:</p>

<p>1. The &quot;-p&quot; command line option takes the
highest precedence.</p>

<p>2. &lt;jaxb:package&gt; customization</p>

<p>3. If targetNamespace is declared, apply targetNamespace
-&gt; Java package name algorithm defined in the
specification.</p>

<p>4. If no targetNamespace is declared, use a hardcoded
package named &quot;generated&quot;.</p>

<p>o It is not legal to have more than one
&lt;jaxb:schemaBindings&gt; per namespace, so it is
impossible to have two schemas in the same target namespace
compiled into different Java packages.</p>

<p>o All schemas being compiled into the same Java package
must be sub- mitted to the XJC binding compiler at the same
time - they cannot be compiled independently and work as
expected.</p>

<p>o Element substitution groups spread across multiple
schema files must be compiled at the same time.</p>
