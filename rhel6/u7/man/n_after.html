<p>NAME after - Execute a command after a time delay</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS after ms</p>

<p>after ms ?script script script ...?</p>

<p>after cancel id</p>

<p>after cancel script script script ...</p>

<p>after idle ?script script script ...?</p>

<p>after info ?id?
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This command is used to delay execution of
the program or to execute a command in background sometime
in the future. It has several forms, depending on the first
argument to the command:</p>

<p>after ms Ms must be an integer giving a time in
milliseconds. The com- mand sleeps for ms milliseconds and
then returns. While the command is sleeping the application
does not respond to events.</p>

<p>after ms ?script script script ...? In this form the
command returns immediately, but it arranges for a Tcl
command to be executed ms milliseconds later as an event
handler. The command will be executed exactly once, at the
given time. The delayed command is formed by concatenating
all the script arguments in the same fashion as the concat
com- mand. The command will be executed at global level
(outside the context of any Tcl procedure). If an error
occurs while execut- ing the delayed command then the
background error will be reported by the command registered
with interp bgerror. The after command returns an identifier
that can be used to cancel the delayed command using after
cancel.</p>

<p>after cancel id Cancels the execution of a delayed
command that was previously scheduled. Id indicates which
command should be canceled; it must have been the return
value from a previous after command. If the command given by
id has already been executed then the after cancel command
has no effect.</p>

<p>after cancel script script ... This command also cancels
the execution of a delayed command. The script arguments are
concatenated together with space sepa- rators (just as in
the concat command). If there is a pending command that
matches the string, it is cancelled and will never be
executed; if no such command is currently pending then the
after cancel command has no effect.</p>

<p>after idle script ?script script ...? Concatenates the
script arguments together with space separators (just as in
the concat command), and arranges for the resulting script
to be evaluated later as an idle callback. The script will
be run exactly once, the next time the event loop is entered
and there are no events to process. The command returns an
identifier that can be used to cancel the delayed command
using after cancel. If an error occurs while executing the
script then the background error will be reported by the
command registered with interp bgerror.</p>

<p>after info ?id? This command returns information about
existing event handlers. If no id argument is supplied, the
command returns a list of the identifiers for all existing
event handlers created by the after command for this
interpreter. If id is supplied, it specifies an existing
handler; id must have been the return value from some
previous call to after and it must not have triggered yet or
been cancelled. In this case the command returns a list with
two elements. The first element of the list is the script
asso- ciated with id, and the second element is either idle
or timer to indicate what kind of event handler it is.</p>

<p>The after ms and after idle forms of the command assume
that the appli- cation is event driven: the delayed commands
will not be executed unless the application enters the event
loop. In applications that are not normally event-driven,
such as tclsh, the event loop can be entered with the vwait
and update commands.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES This defines a command to make Tcl do nothing
at all for N seconds: proc sleep {N} { after [expr {int($N *
1000)}] }</p>

<p>This arranges for the command wake_up to be run in eight
hours (provid- ing the event loop is active at that time):
after [expr {1000 * 60 * 60 * 8}] wake_up</p>

<p>The following command can be used to do long-running
calculations (as represented here by ::my_calc::one_step,
which is assumed to return a boolean indicating whether
another step should be performed) in a step- by-step
fashion, though the calculation itself needs to be arranged
so it can work step-wise. This technique is extra careful to
ensure that the event loop is not starved by the
rescheduling of processing steps (arranging for the next
step to be done using an already-triggered timer event only
when the event queue has been drained) and is useful when
you want to ensure that a Tk GUI remains responsive during a
slow task. proc doOneStep {} { if {[::my_calc::one_step]} {
after idle [list after 0 doOneStep] } } doOneStep</p>
