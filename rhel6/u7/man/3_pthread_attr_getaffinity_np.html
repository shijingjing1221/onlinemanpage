<p>PTHREAD_ATTR_SETAFFINITY_NPLinux Programmer s
MaPTHREAD_ATTR_SETAFFINITY_NP(3)</p>

<p>NAME pthread_attr_setaffinity_np,
pthread_attr_getaffinity_np - set/get CPU affinity attribute
in thread attributes object</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #define _GNU_SOURCE #include
&lt;pthread.h&gt;</p>

<p>int pthread_attr_setaffinity_np(pthread_attr_t *attr,
size_t cpusetsize, const cpu_set_t *cpuset); int
pthread_attr_getaffinity_np(pthread_attr_t *attr, size_t
cpusetsize, cpu_set_t *cpuset);</p>

<p>Compile and link with -pthread.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pthread_attr_setaffinity_np() sets the
CPU affinity mask attribute of the thread attributes object
referred to by attr to the value speci- fied in cpuset. This
attribute determines the CPU affinity mask of a thread
created using the thread attributes object attr.</p>

<p>The pthread_attr_getaffinity_np() returns the CPU
affinity mask attribute of the thread attributes object
referred to by attr in the buffer pointed to by cpuset.</p>

<p>The argument cpusetsize is the length (in bytes) of the
buffer pointed to by cpuset. Typically, this argument would
be specified as sizeof(cpu_set_t).</p>

<p>For more details on CPU affinity masks, see
sched_setaffinity(2). For a description of a set of macros
that can be used to manipulate and inspect CPU sets, see
CPU_SET(3).</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, these functions return 0; on
error, they return a non-zero error number.</p>

<p>ERRORS EINVAL (pthread_attr_setaffinity_np()) cpuset
specified a CPU that was outside the set supported by the
kernel. (The kernel configura- tion option CONFIG_NR_CPUS
defines the range of the set sup- ported by the kernel data
type used to represent CPU sets.)</p>

<p>EINVAL (pthread_attr_getaffinity_np()) A CPU in the
affinity mask of the thread attributes object referred to by
attr lies outside the range specified by cpusetsize (i.e.,
cpuset/cpusetsize is too small).</p>

<p>ENOMEM (pthread_attr_setaffinity_np()) Could not
allocate memory.</p>

<p>VERSIONS These functions are provided by glibc since
version 2.3.4.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO These functions are non-standard GNU
extensions; hence the suffix &quot;_np&quot; (non-portable)
in the names.</p>

<p>NOTES In glibc 2.3.3 only, versions of these functions
were provided that did not have a cpusetsize argument.
Instead the CPU set size given to the underlying system
calls was always sizeof(cpu_set_t).</p>
