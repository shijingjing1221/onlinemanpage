<p>FENCE_ACK_MANUAL(8) cluster FENCE_ACK_MANUAL(8)</p>

<p>NAME fence_ack_manual - a program to override fenced
fencing operations</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS fence_ack_manual [OPTIONS] nodename</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION When fenced(8) fails to fence a node, it
retries indefinately. fence_ack_manual(8) tells fenced to
stop retrying and consider the node fenced.</p>

<p>It is important that this only be done after the node
has been manually turned off or prevented from writing to
shared storage. Without this manual action and verification,
the storage that fencing protects may become corrupted.</p>

<p>When fenced fences a node that has no fence devices
defined in the cluster configuration, the fencing operation
fails. This failure will be repeated indefinately until
fence_ack_manual is run by an operator to indicate the node
is in a safe state to proceed. (Defining no fenc- ing
devices for node is the equivalent of using the fence_manual
agent in previous versions.)</p>

<p>OPTIONS -h Print a help message describing available
options, then exit.</p>
