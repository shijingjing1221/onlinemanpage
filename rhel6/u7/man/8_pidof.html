<p>PIDOF(8) Linux System Administrator s Manual
PIDOF(8)</p>

<p>NAME pidof -- find the process ID of a running
program.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pidof [-s] [-c] [-x] [-m] [-o omitpid] [-o
omitpid..] program [pro- gram..]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Pidof finds the process ids (pids) of the
named programs. It prints those ids on the standard output.
This program is on some systems used in run-level change
scripts, especially when the system has a System-V like rc
structure. In that case these scripts are located in
/etc/rc?.d, where ? is the runlevel. If the system has a
start-stop- daemon (8) program that should be used
instead.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -s Single shot - this instructs the program to
only return one pid.</p>

<p>-c Only return process ids that are running with the
same root directory. This option is ignored for non-root
users, as they will be unable to check the current root
directory of processes they do not own.</p>

<p>-x Scripts too - this causes the program to also return
process ids of shells running the named scripts.</p>

<p>-o omitpid Tells pidof to omit processes with that
process id. The special pid %PPID can be used to name the
parent process of the pidof program, in other words the
calling shell or shell script.</p>

<p>-m When used with -o, will also omit any processes that
have the same argv[0] and argv[1] as any explicitly omitted
process ids. This can be used to avoid multiple shell
scripts concurrently calling pidof returning each others
pids.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS 0 At least one program was found with the
requested name.</p>

<p>1 No program was found with the requested name.</p>

<p>NOTES pidof is actually the same program as killall5;
the program behaves according to the name under which it is
called.</p>

<p>When pidof is invoked with a full pathname to the
program it should find the pid of, it is reasonably safe.
Otherwise it is possible that it returns pids of running
programs that happen to have the same name as the program
you re after but are actually other programs. Note that that
the executable name of running processes is calculated with
read- link(2), so symbolic links to executables will also
match.</p>

killall5(8)</p>
