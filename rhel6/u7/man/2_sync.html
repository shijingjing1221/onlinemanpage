<p>SYNC(2) Linux Programmer s Manual SYNC(2)</p>

<p>NAME sync - commit buffer cache to disk</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>void sync(void);</p>

<p>Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
feature_test_macros(7)):</p>

<p>sync(): _BSD_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;= 500</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION sync() first commits inodes to buffers, and
then buffers to disk.</p>

<p>ERRORS This function is always successful.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO SVr4, 4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>NOTES Since glibc 2.2.2 the Linux prototype is as listed
above, following the various standards. In libc4, libc5, and
glibc up to 2.2.1 it was &quot;int sync(void)&quot;, and
sync() always returned 0.</p>

<p>BUGS According to the standard specification (e.g.,
POSIX.1-2001), sync() schedules the writes, but may return
before the actual writing is done. However, since version
1.3.20 Linux does actually wait. (This still does not
guarantee data integrity: modern disks have large
caches.)</p>
