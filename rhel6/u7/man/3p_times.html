<p>TIMES(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual TIMES(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME times - get process and waited-for child process
times</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/times.h&gt;</p>

<p>clock_t times(struct tms *buffer);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The times() function shall fill the tms
structure pointed to by buffer with time-accounting
information. The tms structure is defined in
&lt;sys/times.h&gt;.</p>

<p>All times are measured in terms of the number of clock
ticks used.</p>

<p>The times of a terminated child process shall be
included in the tms_cutime and tms_cstime elements of the
parent when wait() or wait- pid() returns the process ID of
this terminated child. If a child pro- cess has not waited
for its children, their times shall not be included in its
times.</p>

<p>* The tms_utime structure member is the CPU time charged
for the exe- cution of user instructions of the calling
process.</p>

<p>* The tms_stime structure member is the CPU time charged
for execution by the system on behalf of the calling
process.</p>

<p>* The tms_cutime structure member is the sum of the
tms_utime and tms_cutime times of the child processes.</p>

<p>* The tms_cstime structure member is the sum of the
tms_stime and tms_cstime times of the child processes.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, times() shall
return the elapsed real time, in clock ticks, since an
arbitrary point in the past (for example, sys- tem start-up
time). This point does not change from one invocation of
times() within the process to another. The return value may
overflow the possible range of type clock_t. If times()
fails, (clock_t)-1 shall be returned and errno set to
indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Timing a Database Lookup The following example
defines two functions, start_clock() and end_clock(), that
are used to time a lookup. It also defines variables of type
clock_t and tms to measure the duration of transactions. The
start_clock() function saves the beginning times given by
the times() function. The end_clock() function gets the
ending times and prints the difference between the two
times.</p>

<p>#include &lt;sys/times.h&gt; #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
... void start_clock(void); void end_clock(char *msg); ...
static clock_t st_time; static clock_t en_time; static
struct tms st_cpu; static struct tms en_cpu; ... void
start_clock() { st_time = times(&amp;st_cpu); }</p>

<p>/* This example assumes that the result of each
subtraction is within the range of values that can be
represented in an integer type. */ void end_clock(char *msg)
{ en_time = times(&amp;en_cpu);</p>

<p>fputs(msg,stdout); printf(&quot;Real Time: %jd, User
Time %jd, System Time %jn&quot;, (intmax_t)(en_time -
st_time), (intmax_t)(en_cpu.tms_utime - st_cpu.tms_utime),
(intmax_t)(en_cpu.tms_stime - st_cpu.tms_stime)); }</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE Applications should use
sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK) to determine the number of clock ticks
per second as it may vary from system to system.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The accuracy of the times reported is
intentionally left unspecified to allow implementations
flexibility in design, from uniprocessor to multi-processor
networks.</p>

<p>The inclusion of times of child processes is recursive,
so that a par- ent process may collect the total times of
all of its descendants. But the times of a child are only
added to those of its parent when its parent successfully
waits on the child. Thus, it is not guaranteed that a parent
process can always see the total times of all its
descendants; see also the discussion of the term realtime in
alarm().</p>

<p>If the type clock_t is defined to be a signed 32-bit
integer, it over- flows in somewhat more than a year if
there are 60 clock ticks per sec- ond, or less than a year
if there are 100. There are individual systems that run
continuously for longer than that. This volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001 permits an implementation to make the reference
point for the returned value be the start-up time of the
process, rather than system start-up time.</p>

<p>The term charge in this context has nothing to do with
billing for services. The operating system accounts for time
used in this way. That information must be correct,
regardless of how that information is used.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
