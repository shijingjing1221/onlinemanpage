SYSFS_SCHEDULE_CALLB(9)</p>

<p>NAME sysfs_schedule_callback - helper to schedule a
callback for a kobject</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS int sysfs_schedule_callback(struct kobject *
kobj, void (*func) (void *), void * data, struct module *
owner);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS kobj object we&acute;re acting for.</p>

<p>func callback function to invoke later.</p>

<p>data argument to pass to func.</p>

<p>owner module owning the callback code</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION sysfs attribute methods must not unregister
themselves or their parent kobject (which would amount to
the same thing). Attempts to do so will deadlock, since
unregistration is mutually exclusive with driver
callbacks.</p>

<p>Instead methods can call this routine, which will
attempt to allocate and schedule a workqueue request to call
back func with data as its argument in the workqueue&acute;s
process context. kobj will be pinned until func returns.</p>

<p>Returns 0 if the request was submitted, -ENOMEM if
storage could not be allocated, -ENODEV if a reference to
owner isn&acute;t available, -EAGAIN if a callback has
already been scheduled for kobj.</p>
