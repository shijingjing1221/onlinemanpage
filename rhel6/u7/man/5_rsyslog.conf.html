<p>RSYSLOG.CONF(5) Linux System Administration
RSYSLOG.CONF(5)</p>

<p>NAME rsyslog.conf - rsyslogd(8) configuration file</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The rsyslog.conf file is the main
configuration file for the rsys- logd(8) which logs system
messages on *nix systems. This file speci- fies rules for
logging. For special features see the rsyslogd(8) man- page.
Rsyslog.conf is backward-compatible with sysklogds
syslog.conf file. So if you migrate from sysklogd you can
rename it and it should work.</p>

<p>Note that this version of rsyslog ships with extensive
documentation in html format. This is provided in the ./doc
subdirectory and probably in a separate package if you
installed rsyslog via a packaging system. To use rsyslogs
advanced features, you need to look at the html docu-
mentation, because the man pages only cover basic aspects of
operation.</p>

<p>MODULES Rsyslog has a modular design. Consequently,
there is a growing number of modules. See the html
documentation for their full description.</p>

<p>omsnmp SNMP trap output module</p>

<p>omgssapi Output module for GSS-enabled syslog</p>

<p>ommysql Output module for MySQL</p>

<p>omrelp Output module for the reliable RELP protocol
(prevents message loss). For details, see below at imrelp
and the html documenta- tion. It can be used like this:</p>

<p>*.* :omrelp:server:port</p>

<p>*.* :omrelp:192.168.0.1:2514 # actual sample</p>

<p>ompgsql Output module for PostgreSQL</p>

<p>omlibdbi Generic database output module
(Firebird/Interbase, MS SQL, Sybase, SQLite, Ingres, Oracle,
mSQL)</p>

<p>imfile Input module for text files</p>

<p>imudp Input plugin for UDP syslog. Replaces the
deprecated -r option. Can be used like this:</p>

<p>$ModLoad imudp</p>

<p>$UDPServerRun 514</p>

<p>imtcp Input plugin for plain TCP syslog. Replaces the
deprecated -t option. Can be used like this:</p>

<p>$ModLoad imtcp</p>

<p>$InputTCPServerRun 514</p>

<p>imrelp Input plugin for the RELP protocol. RELP can be
used instead of UDP or plain TCP syslog to provide reliable
delivery of syslog messages. Please note that plain TCP
syslog does NOT provide truly reliable delivery, with it
messages may be lost when there is a connection problem or
the server shuts down. RELP prevents message loss in those
cases. It can be used like this:</p>

<p>$ModLoad imrelp</p>

<p>$InputRELPServerRun 2514</p>

<p>imgssapi Input plugin for plain TCP and GSS-enable
syslog</p>

<p>immark Support for mark messages</p>

<p>imklog Kernel logging. To include kernel log messages,
you need to do</p>

<p>$ModLoad imklog</p>

<p>Please note that the klogd daemon is no longer necessary
and consequently no longer provided by the rsyslog pack-
age.</p>

<p>imuxsock Unix sockets, including the system log socket.
You need to specify</p>

<p>$ModLoad imuxsock</p>

<p>in order to receive log messages from local system pro-
cesses. This config directive should only left out if you
know exactly what you are doing.</p>

<p>BASIC STRUCTURE Lines starting with a hash mark (#) and
empty lines are ignored. Rsyslog.conf should contain
following sections (sorted by recommended order in
file):</p>

<p>Global directives Global directives set some global
properties of whole rsyslog daemon, for example size of main
message queue ($MainMessageQueueSize), loading external
modules ($Mod- Load) and so on. All global directives need
to be speci- fied on a line by their own and must start with
a dollar- sign. The complete list of global directives can
be found in html documentation in doc directory or online on
web pages.</p>

<p>Templates Templates allow you to specify format of the
logged mes- sage. They are also used for dynamic file name
genera- tion. They have to be defined before they are used
in rules. For more info about templates see TEMPLATES sec-
tion of this manpage.</p>

<p>Output channels Output channels provide an umbrella for
any type of out- put that the user might want. They have to
be defined before they are used in rules. For more info
about output channels see OUTPUT CHANNELS section of this
manpage.</p>

<p>Rules (selector + action) Every rule line consists of
two fields, a selector field and an action field. These two
fields are separated by one or more spaces or tabs. The
selector field specifies a pattern of facilities and
priorities belonging to the specified action.</p>

<p>SELECTORS The selector field itself again consists of
two parts, a facil- ity and a priority, separated by a
period (.). Both parts are case insensitive and can also be
specified as decimal numbers, but dont do that, you have
been warned. Both facilities and priorities are described in
syslog(3). The names mentioned below correspond to the
similar LOG_-values in /usr/include/syslog.h.</p>

<p>The facility is one of the following keywords: auth,
authpriv, cron, daemon, kern, lpr, mail, mark, news,
security (same as auth), syslog, user, uucp and local0
through local7. The keyword security should not be used
anymore and mark is only for inter- nal use and therefore
should not be used in applications. Any- way, you may want
to specify and redirect these messages here. The facility
specifies the subsystem that produced the message, i.e. all
mail programs log with the mail facility (LOG_MAIL) if they
log using syslog.</p>

<p>The priority is one of the following keywords, in
ascending order: debug, info, notice, warning, warn (same as
warning), err, error (same as err), crit, alert, emerg,
panic (same as emerg). The keywords error, warn and panic
are deprecated and should not be used anymore. The priority
defines the severity of the message.</p>

<p>The behavior of the original BSD syslogd is that all
messages of the specified priority and higher are logged
according to the given action. Rsyslogd behaves the same,
but has some exten- sions.</p>

<p>In addition to the above mentioned names the rsyslogd(8)
under- stands the following extensions: An asterisk (*)
stands for all facilities or all priorities, depending on
where it is used (before or after the period). The keyword
none stands for no priority of the given facility.</p>

<p>You can specify multiple facilities with the same
priority pat- tern in one statement using the comma (,)
operator. You may specify as much facilities as you want.
Remember that only the facility part from such a statement
is taken, a priority part would be skipped.</p>

<p>Multiple selectors may be specified for a single action
using the semicolon (;) separator. Remember that each
selector in the selector field is capable to overwrite the
preceding ones. Using this behavior you can exclude some
priorities from the pattern.</p>

<p>Rsyslogd has a syntax extension to the original BSD
source, that makes its use more intuitively. You may precede
every priority with an equals sign (=) to specify only this
single priority and not any of the above. You may also (both
is valid, too) pre- cede the priority with an exclamation
mark (!) to ignore all that priorities, either exact this
one or this and any higher priority. If you use both
extensions than the exclamation mark must occur before the
equals sign, just use it intuitively.</p>

<p>ACTIONS The action field of a rule describes what to do
with the mes- sage. In general, message content is written
to a kind of &quot;log- file&quot;. But also other actions
might be done, like writing to a database table or
forwarding to another host.</p>

<p>Regular file Typically messages are logged to real
files. The file has to be specified with full pathname,
beginning with a slash (/ ).</p>

<p>Example: *.*
/var/log/traditionalfile.log;RSYSLOG_Traditional- Format #
log to a file in the traditional format</p>

<p>Note: if you would like to use high-precision timestamps
in your log files, just remove the
&quot;;RSYSLOG_TraditionalFormat&quot;. That will select the
default template, which, if not changed, uses RFC 3339
timestamps.</p>

<p>Example: *.* /var/log/file.log # log to a file with
RFC3339 timestamps</p>

<p>Named pipes This version of rsyslogd(8) has support for
logging output to named pipes (fifos). A fifo or named pipe
can be used as a des- tination for log messages by
prepending a pipe symbol (| ) to the name of the file. This
is handy for debugging. Note that the fifo must be created
with the mkfifo(1) command before rsys- logd(8) is
started.</p>

<p>Terminal and console If the file you specified is a tty,
special tty-handling is done, same with /dev/console.</p>

<p>Remote machine There are three ways to forward message:
the traditional UDP transport, which is extremely lossy but
standard, the plain TCP based transport which loses messages
only during certain situa- tions but is widely available and
the RELP transport which does not lose messages but is
currently available only as part of rsyslogd 3.15.0 and
above.</p>

<p>To forward messages to another host via UDP, prepend the
host- name with the at sign (&quot;@&quot;). To forward it
via plain tcp, prepend two at signs (&quot;@@&quot;). To
forward via RELP, prepend the string &quot;:omrelp:&quot; in
front of the hostname.</p>

<p>Example: *.* @192.168.0.1</p>

<p>In the example above, messages are forwarded via UDP to
the machine 192.168.0.1, the destination port defaults to
514. Due to the nature of UDP, you will probably lose some
messages in transit. If you expect high traffic volume, you
can expect to lose a quite noticeable number of messages
(the higher the traf- fic, the more likely and severe is
message loss).</p>

<p>If you would like to prevent message loss, use RELP: *.*
:omrelp:192.168.0.1:2514</p>

<p>Note that a port number was given as there is no
standard port for relp.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that you need to load the correct input and
output plugins (see &quot;Modules&quot; above).</p>

<p>Please note that rsyslogd offers a variety of options in
regard- ing to remote forwarding. For full details, please
see the html documentation.</p>

<p>List of users Usually critical messages are also
directed to root on that machine. You can specify a list of
users that shall get the mes- sage by simply writing
&quot;:omusrmsg:&quot; followed by the login name. You may
specify more than one user by separating them with com- mas
(,). If theyre logged in they get the message (for exam-
ple: &quot;:omusrmsg:root,user1,user2&quot;).</p>

<p>Everyone logged on Emergency messages often go to all
users currently online to notify them that something strange
is happening with the system. To specify this
wall(1)-feature use an &quot;:omusrmsg:*&quot;.</p>

<p>Database table This allows logging of the message to a
database table. By default, a MonitorWare-compatible schema
is required for this to work. You can create that schema
with the createDB.SQL file that came with the rsyslog
package. You can also use any other schema of your liking -
you just need to define a proper template and assign this
template to the action.</p>

<p>See the html documentation for further details on
database log- ging.</p>

<p>Discard If the discard action is carried out, the
received message is immediately discarded. Discard can be
highly effective if you want to filter out some annoying
messages that otherwise would fill your log files. To do
that, place the discard actions early in your log files.
This often plays well with property-based filters, giving
you great freedom in specifying what you do not want.</p>

<p>Discard is just the single tilde character with no
further parameters.</p>

<p>Example: *.* ~ # discards everything.</p>

<p>Output channel Binds an output channel definition (see
there for details) to this action. Output channel actions
must start with a $-sign, e.g. if you would like to bind
your output channel definition &quot;mychannel&quot; to the
action, use &quot;$mychannel&quot;. Output channels support
template definitions like all all other actions.</p>

<p>Shell execute This executes a program in a subshell. The
program is passed the template-generated message as the only
command line parameter. Rsyslog waits until the program
terminates and only then contin- ues to run.</p>

<p>Example: ^program-to-execute;template</p>

<p>The program-to-execute can be any valid executable. It
receives the template string as a single parameter
(argv[1]).</p>

<p>FILTER CONDITIONS Rsyslog offers three different types
&quot;filter conditions&quot;: * &quot;traditional&quot;
severity and facility based selectors * property-based
filters * expression-based filters</p>

<p>Blocks Rsyslogd supports BSD-style blocks inside
rsyslog.conf. Each block of lines is separated from the
previous block by a program or hostname specification. A
block will only log messages corre- sponding to the most
recent program and hostname specifications given. Thus, a
block which selects &quot;ppp&quot; as the program, directly
followed by a block that selects messages from the hostname
&quot;dialhost&quot;, then the second block will only log
mes- sages from the ppp program on dialhost.</p>

<p>Selectors Selectors are the traditional way of filtering
syslog messages. They have been kept in rsyslog with their
original syntax, because it is well-known, highly effective
and also needed for compatibility with stock syslogd
configuration files. If you just need to filter based on
priority and facility, you should do this with selector
lines. They are not second-class citizens in rsyslog and
offer the best performance for this job.</p>

<p>Property-Based Filters Property-based filters are unique
to rsyslogd. They allow to filter on any property, like
HOSTNAME, syslogtag and msg.</p>

<p>A property-based filter must start with a colon in
column 0. This tells rsyslogd that it is the new filter
type. The colon must be followed by the property name, a
comma, the name of the compare operation to carry out,
another comma and then the value to compare against. This
value must be quoted. There can be spaces and tabs between
the commas. Property names and compare operations are
case-sensitive, so &quot;msg&quot; works, while
&quot;MSG&quot; is an invalid property name. In brief, the
syntax is as follows:</p>

<p>:property, [!]compare-operation, &quot;value&quot;</p>

<p>The following compare-operations are currently
supported:</p>

<p>contains Checks if the string provided in value is con-
tained in the property</p>

<p>isequal Compares the &quot;value&quot; string provided
and the prop- erty contents. These two values must be
exactly equal to match.</p>

<p>startswith Checks if the value is found exactly at the
begin- ning of the property value</p>

<p>regex Compares the property against the provided regular
expression.</p>

<p>Expression-Based Filters See the html documentation for
this feature.</p>

<p>TEMPLATES Every output in rsyslog uses templates - this
holds true for files, user messages and so on. Templates
compatible with the stock syslogd formats are hardcoded into
rsyslogd. If no tem- plate is specified, we use one of these
hardcoded templates. Search for &quot;template_&quot; in
syslogd.c and you will find the hard- coded ones.</p>

<p>A template consists of a template directive, a name, the
actual template text and optional options. A sample is:</p>

<p>$template MyTemplateName,7Text %property% some more
texn&quot;,&lt;options&gt;</p>

<p>The &quot;$template&quot; is the template directive. It
tells rsyslog that this line contains a template. The
backslash is an escape char- acter. For example, 7 rings the
bell (this is an ASCII value), is a new line. The set in
rsyslog is a bit restricted cur- rently.</p>

<p>All text in the template is used literally, except for
things within percent signs. These are properties and allow
you access to the contents of the syslog message. Properties
are accessed via the property replacer and it can for
example pick a sub- string or do date-specific formatting.
More on this is the PROP- ERTY REPLACER section of this
manpage.</p>

<p>To escape: % = = \ --&gt; is used to escape (as in C)
$template TraditionalFormat,&quot;%timegenerated% %HOSTNAME%
%syslog- tag%%msg%0</p>

<p>Properties can be accessed by the property replacer (see
there for details).</p>

<p>Please note that templates can also by used to generate
selector lines with dynamic file names. For example, if you
would like to split syslog messages from different hosts to
different files (one per host), you can define the following
template:</p>

<p>$template
DynFile,&quot;/var/log/system-%HOSTNAME%.log&quot;</p>

<p>This template can then be used when defining an output
selector line. It will result in something like
&quot;/var/log/system-local- host.log&quot;</p>

<p>Template options The &lt;options&gt; part is optional.
It carries options influencing the template as whole. See
details below. Be sure NOT to mis- take template options
with property options - the later ones are processed by the
property replacer and apply to a SINGLE prop- erty, only
(and not the whole template).</p>

<p>Template options are case-insensitive. Currently defined
are:</p>

<p>sql format the string suitable for a SQL statement in
MySQL format. This will replace single quotes (&quot;&quot;)
and the backslash character by their back- slash-escaped
counterpart (&quot;&acute;&quot; and &quot; each field.
Please note that in MySQL configura- tion, the
NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES mode must be turned off for this format
to work (this is the default).</p>

<p>stdsql format the string suitable for a SQL statement
that is to be sent to a standards-compliant sql server. This
will replace single quotes (&quot; &quot;) by two single
quotes (&quot;&quot;) inside each field. You must use stdsql
together with MySQL if in MySQL configuration the
NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES is turned on.</p>

<p>Either the sql or stdsql option MUST be specified when a
tem- plate is used for writing to a database, otherwise
injection might occur. Please note that due to the
unfortunate fact that several vendors have violated the sql
standard and introduced their own escape methods, it is
impossible to have a single option doing all the work. So
you yourself must make sure you are using the right format.
If you choose the wrong one, you are still vulnerable to sql
injection.</p>

<p>Please note that the database writer *checks* that the
sql option is present in the template. If it is not present,
the write database action is disabled. This is to guard you
against accidental forgetting it and then becoming
vulnerable to SQL injection. The sql option can also be
useful with files - espe- cially if you want to import them
into a database on another machine for performance reasons.
However, do NOT use it if you do not have a real need for it
- among others, it takes some toll on the processing time.
Not much, but on a really busy sys- tem you might notice it
;)</p>

<p>The default template for the write to database action
has the sql option set.</p>

<p>Template examples Please note that the samples are split
across multiple lines. A template MUST NOT actually be split
across multiple lines.</p>

<p>A template that resembles traditional syslogd file
output:</p>

<p>$template TraditionalFormat,&quot;%timegenerated%
%HOSTNAME% %syslogtag%%msg:::drop-last-lf%0</p>

<p>A template that tells you a little more about the
message:</p>

<p>$template precise,&quot;%syslogpriority%,%syslogfacil-
ity%,%timegenerated%,%HOSTNAME%, %syslogtag%,%msg%0</p>

<p>A template for RFC 3164 format:</p>

<p>$template RFC3164fmt,&quot;&lt;%PRI%&gt;%TIMESTAMP%
%HOSTNAME% %sys- logtag%%msg%&quot;</p>

<p>A template for the format traditionally used for user
messages:</p>

<p>$template usermsg,&quot;
XXXX%syslogtag%%msg%0r&quot;</p>

<p>And a template with the traditional wall-message
format:</p>

<p>07Message from $template wallmsg,&quot;
syslogd@%HOSTNAME% at %timegenerated%&quot;</p>

<p>A template that can be used for writing to a database
(please note the SQL template option)</p>

<p>$template MySQLInsert,&quot;insert iut, message,
receivedat values (%iut%, %msg:::UPPERCASE%, %timegener-0,
SQL ated:::date-mysql%) into systemevents</p>

<p>NOTE 1: This template is embedded into core application
under name StdDBFmt , so you dont need to define it.</p>

<p>NOTE 2: You have to have MySQL module installed to use
this template.</p>

<p>OUTPUT CHANNELS Output Channels are a new concept first
introduced in rsyslog 0.9.0. As of this writing, it is most
likely that they will be replaced by something different in
the future. So if you use them, be prepared to change you
configuration file syntax when you upgrade to a later
release.</p>

<p>Output channels are defined via an $outchannel
directive. Its syntax is as follows:</p>

<p>$outchannel
name,file-name,max-size,action-on-max-size</p>

<p>name is the name of the output channel (not the file),
file-name is the file name to be written to, max-size the
maximum allowed size and action-on-max-size a command to be
issued when the max size is reached. This command always has
exactly one parameter. The binary is that part of
action-on-max-size before the first space, its parameter is
everything behind that space.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that $outchannel just defines a channel
with &quot;name&quot;. It does not activate it. To do so,
you must use a selector line (see below). That selector line
includes the chan- nel name plus &quot;:omfile:$&quot; in
front of it. A sample might be:</p>

<p>*.* :omfile:$mychannel</p>

<p>PROPERTY REPLACER The property replacer is a core
component in rsyslogd s output system. A syslog message has
a number of well-defined properties (see below). Each of
this properties can be accessed and manipu- lated by the
property replacer. With it, it is easy to use only part of a
property value or manipulate the value, e.g. by con- verting
all characters to lower case.</p>

<p>Accessing Properties Syslog message properties are used
inside templates. They are accessed by putting them between
percent signs. Properties can be modified by the property
replacer. The full syntax is as fol- lows:</p>

<p>%propname:fromChar:toChar:options%</p>

<p>propname is the name of the property to access. It is
case-sen- sitive.</p>

<p>Available Properties msg the MSG part of the message
(aka &quot;the message&quot; ;))</p>

<p>rawmsg the message exactly as it was received from the
socket. Should be useful for debugging.</p>

<p>HOSTNAME hostname from the message</p>

<p>FROMHOST hostname of the system the message was received
from (in a relay chain, this is the system immediately in
front of us and not necessarily the original sender)</p>

<p>syslogtag TAG from the message</p>

<p>programname the &quot;static&quot; part of the tag, as
defined by BSD syslogd. For example, when TAG is
&quot;named[12345]&quot;, programname is
&quot;named&quot;.</p>

<p>PRI PRI part of the message - undecoded (single
value)</p>

<p>PRI-text the PRI part of the message in a textual form
(e.g. &quot;sys- log.info&quot;)</p>

<p>IUT the monitorware InfoUnitType - used when talking to
a MonitorWare backend (also for phpLogCon)</p>

<p>syslogfacility the facility from the message - in
numerical form</p>

<p>syslogfacility-text the facility from the message - in
text form</p>

<p>syslogseverity severity from the message - in numerical
form</p>

<p>syslogseverity-text severity from the message - in text
form</p>

<p>timegenerated timestamp when the message was RECEIVED.
Always in high resolution</p>

<p>timereported timestamp from the message. Resolution
depends on what was provided in the message (in most cases,
only seconds)</p>

<p>TIMESTAMP alias for timereported</p>

<p>PROTOCOL-VERSION The contents of the PROTOCOL-VERSION
field from IETF draft draft-ietf-syslog-protocol</p>

<p>STRUCTURED-DATA The contents of the STRUCTURED-DATA
field from IETF draft draft-ietf-syslog-protocol</p>

<p>APP-NAME The contents of the APP-NAME field from IETF
draft draft- ietf-syslog-protocol</p>

<p>PROCID The contents of the PROCID field from IETF draft
draft- ietf-syslog-protocol</p>

<p>MSGID The contents of the MSGID field from IETF draft
draft- ietf-syslog-protocol</p>

<p>$NOW The current date stamp in the format YYYY-MM-DD</p>

<p>$YEAR The current year (4-digit)</p>

<p>$MONTH The current month (2-digit)</p>

<p>$DAY The current day of the month (2-digit)</p>

<p>$HOUR The current hour in military (24 hour) time
(2-digit)</p>

<p>$MINUTE The current minute (2-digit)</p>

<p>Properties starting with a $-sign are so-called system
proper- ties. These do NOT stem from the message but are
rather inter- nally-generated.</p>

<p>Character Positions FromChar and toChar are used to
build substrings. They specify the offset within the string
that should be copied. Offset counting starts at 1, so if
you need to obtain the first 2 char- acters of the message
text, you can use this syntax: &quot;%msg:1:2%&quot;. If you
do not wish to specify from and to, but you want to specify
options, you still need to include the colons. For example,
if you would like to convert the full message text to lower
case, use &quot;%msg:::lowercase%&quot;. If you would like
to extract from a position until the end of the string, you
can place a dollar-sign (&quot;$&quot;) in toChar (e.g.
%msg:10:$%, which will extract from position 10 to the end
of the string).</p>

<p>There is also support for regular expressions. To use
them, you need to place a &quot;R&quot; into FromChar. This
tells rsyslog that a regular expression instead of
position-based extraction is desired. The actual regular
expression must then be provided in toChar. The regular
expression must be followed by the string &quot;--end&quot;.
It denotes the end of the regular expression and will not
become part of it. If you are using regular expressions, the
property replacer will return the part of the property text
that matches the regular expression. An example for a
property replacer sequence with a regular expression is:
&quot;%msg:R:.*Sev:.</p>

<p>Also, extraction can be done based on so-called
&quot;fields&quot;. To do so, place a &quot;F&quot; into
FromChar. A field in its current definition is anything that
is delimited by a delimiter character. The delimiter by
default is TAB (US-ASCII value 9). However, if can be
changed to any other US-ASCII character by specifying a
comma and the decimal US-ASCII value of the delimiter
immediately after the &quot;F&quot;. For example, to use
comma (&quot;,&quot;) as a delimiter, use this field
specifier: &quot;F,44&quot;. If your syslog data is delim-
ited, this is a quicker way to extract than via regular
expres- sions (actually, a *much* quicker way). Field
counting starts at 1. Field zero is accepted, but will
always lead to a &quot;field not found&quot; error. The same
happens if a field number higher than the number of fields
in the property is requested. The field number must be
placed in the &quot;ToChar&quot; parameter. An example where
the 3rd field (delimited by TAB) from the msg property is
extracted is as follows: &quot;%msg:F:3%&quot;. The same
example with semicolon as delimiter is
&quot;%msg:F,59:3%&quot;.</p>

<p>Please note that the special characters &quot;F&quot;
and &quot;R&quot; are case- sensitive. Only upper case
works, lower case will return an error. There are no white
spaces permitted inside the sequence (that will lead to
error messages and will NOT provide the intended
result).</p>

<p>Property Options Property options are case-insensitive.
Currently, the following options are defined:</p>

<p>uppercase convert property to lowercase only</p>

<p>lowercase convert property text to uppercase only</p>

<p>drop-last-lf The last LF in the message (if any), is
dropped. Espe- cially useful for PIX.</p>

<p>date-mysql format as mysql date</p>

<p>date-rfc3164 format as RFC 3164 date</p>

<p>date-rfc3339 format as RFC 3339 date</p>

<p>escape-cc replace control characters (ASCII value 127
and values less then 32) with an escape sequence. The
sequence is &quot;#&lt;charval&gt;&quot; where charval is
the 3-digit decimal value of the control character. For
example, a tabulator would be replaced by
&quot;#009&quot;.</p>

<p>space-cc replace control characters by spaces</p>

<p>drop-cc drop control characters - the resulting string
will nei- ther contain control characters, escape sequences
nor any other replacement character like space.</p>

<p>QUEUED OPERATIONS Rsyslogd supports queued operations to
handle offline outputs (like remote syslogds or database
servers being down). When running in queued mode, rsyslogd
buffers messages to memory and optionally to disk (on an
as-needed basis). Queues survive rsys- logd restarts.</p>

<p>It is highly suggested to use remote forwarding and
database writing in queued mode, only.</p>

<p>To learn more about queued operations, see the html
documenta- tion.</p>

<p>The complete documentation can be found in the doc
folder of the rsyslog distribution or online at</p>

<p>http://www.rsyslog.com/doc</p>

<p>Please note that the man page reflects only a subset of
the con- figuration options. Be sure to read the html
documentation for all features and details. This is
especially vital if you plan to set up a
more-then-extremely-simple system.</p>

<p>AUTHORS rsyslogd is taken from sysklogd sources, which
have been heavily modified by Rainer Gerhards
(rgerhards@adiscon.com) and others.</p>
