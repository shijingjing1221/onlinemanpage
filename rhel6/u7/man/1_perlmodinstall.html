PERLMODINSTALL(1)</p>

<p>NAME perlmodinstall - Installing CPAN Modules</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION You can think of a module as the fundamental
unit of reusable Perl code; see perlmod for details.
Whenever anyone creates a chunk of Perl code that they think
will be useful to the world, they register as a Perl
developer at http://www.cpan.org/modules/04pause.html so
that they can then upload their code to the CPAN. The CPAN
is the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network and can be
accessed at http://www.cpan.org/ , and searched at
http://search.cpan.org/ .</p>

<p>This documentation is for people who want to download
CPAN modules and install them on their own computer.</p>

<p>PREAMBLE First, are you sure that the module isnt
already on your system? Try &quot;perl -MFoo -e 1&quot;.
(Replace &quot;Foo&quot; with the name of the module; for
instance, &quot;perl -MCGI::Carp -e 1&quot;.</p>

<p>If you don t see an error message, you have the module.
(If you do see an error message, its still possible you have
the module, but that it s not in your path, which you can
display with &quot;perl -e &quot;print
qq(@INC)&quot;&quot;.) For the remainder of this document,
we ll assume that you really honestly truly lack an
installed module, but have found it on the CPAN.</p>

<p>So now you have a file ending in .tar.gz (or, less
often, .zip). You know there s a tasty module inside. There
are four steps you must now take:</p>

<p>DECOMPRESS the file UNPACK the file into a directory
BUILD the module (sometimes unnecessary) INSTALL the
module.</p>

<p>Heres how to perform each step for each operating
system. This is &lt;not&gt; a substitute for reading the
README and INSTALL files that might have come with your
module!</p>

<p>Also note that these instructions are tailored for
installing the module into your systems repository of Perl
modules -- but you can install modules into any directory
you wish. For instance, where I say &quot;perl
Makefile.PL&quot;, you can substitute &quot;perl Makefile.PL
PREFIX=/my/perl_directory&quot; to install the modules into
&quot;/my/perl_directory&quot;. Then you can use the modules
from your Perl programs with &quot;use lib
&quot;/my/perl_directory/lib/site_perl&quot;;&quot; or
sometimes just &quot;use
&quot;/my/perl_directory&quot;;&quot;. If youre on a system
that requires superuser/root access to install modules into
the directories you see when you type &quot;perl -e
&quot;print qq(@INC)&quot;&quot;, youll want to install them
into a local directory (such as your home directory) and use
this approach.</p>

<p>&middot; If yore on a Unix or Unix-like system,</p>

<p>You can use Andreas Koenigs CPAN module (
http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/CPAN ) to automate the
following steps, from DECOMPRESS through INSTALL.</p>

<p>A. DECOMPRESS</p>

<p>Decompress the file with &quot;gzip -d
yourmodule.tar.gz&quot;</p>

<p>You can get gzip from ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/</p>

<p>Or, you can combine this step with the next to save disk
space:</p>

<p>gzip -dc yourmodule.tar.gz | tar -xof -</p>

<p>B. UNPACK</p>

<p>Unpack the result with &quot;tar -xof
yourmodule.tar&quot;</p>

<p>C. BUILD</p>

<p>Go into the newly-created directory and type:</p>

<p>perl Makefile.PL make test</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/my/perl_directory</p>

<p>to install it locally. (Remember that if you do this,
youll have to put &quot;use lib
&quot;/my/perl_directory&quot;;&quot; near the top of the
program that is to use this module.</p>

<p>D. INSTALL</p>

<p>While still in that directory, type:</p>

<p>make install</p>

<p>Make sure you have the appropriate permissions to
install the module in your Perl 5 library directory. Often,
youll need to be root.</p>

<p>That s all you need to do on Unix systems with dynamic
linking. Most Unix systems have dynamic linking -- if yours
doesnt, or if for another reason you have a
statically-linked perl, and the module requires compilation,
youll need to build a new Perl binary that includes the
module. Again, youll probably need to be root.</p>

<p>&middot; If yore running ActivePerl (Win95/98/2K/NT/XP,
Linux, Solaris)</p>

<p>First, type &quot;ppm&quot; from a shell and see whether
ActiveStates PPM repository has your module. If so, you can
install it with &quot;ppm&quot; and you won t have to bother
with any of the other steps here. You might be able to use
the CPAN instructions from the &quot;Unix or Linux&quot;
section above as well; give it a try. Otherwise, you ll have
to follow the steps below.</p>

<p>A. DECOMPRESS</p>

<p>You can use the shareware Winzip ( http://www.winzip.com
) to decompress and unpack modules.</p>

<p>B. UNPACK</p>

<p>If you used WinZip, this was already done for you.</p>

<p>C. BUILD</p>

<p>Youll need the &quot;nmake&quot; utility, available at
http://download.microsoft.com/download/vc15/Patch/1.52/W95/EN-US/nmake15.exe
or dmake, available on CPAN.
http://search.cpan.org/dist/dmake/</p>

<p>Does the module require compilation (i.e. does it have
files that end in .xs, .c, .h, .y, .cc, .cxx, or .C)? If it
does, life is now officially tough for you, because you have
to compile the module yourself -- no easy feat on Windows.
You ll need a compiler such as Visual C++. Alternatively,
you can download a pre-built PPM package from ActiveState.
http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Downloads/ActivePerl/PPM/</p>

<p>Go into the newly-created directory and type:</p>

<p>perl Makefile.PL nmake test</p>

<p>D. INSTALL</p>

<p>While still in that directory, type:</p>

<p>nmake install</p>

<p>&middot; If you re using a Macintosh with
&quot;Classic&quot; MacOS and MacPerl,</p>

<p>A. DECOMPRESS</p>

<p>First, make sure you have the latest cpan-mac
distribution ( http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/CNANDOR/ ),
which has utilities for doing all of the steps. Read the
cpan-mac directions carefully and install it. If you choose
not to use cpan-mac for some reason, there are alternatives
listed here.</p>

<p>After installing cpan-mac, drop the module archive on
the untarzipme droplet, which will decompress and unpack for
you.</p>

<p>Or, you can either use the shareware StuffIt Expander
program ( http://www.aladdinsys.com/expander/ ) in
combination with DropStuff with Expander Enhancer (
http://www.aladdinsys.com/dropstuff/ ) or the freeware
MacGzip program (
http://persephone.cps.unizar.es/general/gente/spd/gzip/gzip.html
).</p>

<p>B. UNPACK</p>

<p>If youre using untarzipme or StuffIt, the archive should
be extracted now. Or, you can use the freeware suntar or Tar
( http://hyperarchive.lcs.mit.edu/HyperArchive/Archive/cmp/
).</p>

<p>C. BUILD</p>

<p>Check the contents of the distribution. Read the modules
documentation, looking for reasons why you might have
trouble using it with MacPerl. Look for .xs and .c files,
which normally denote that the distribution must be
compiled, and you cannot install it &quot;out of the
box.&quot; (See &quot;PORTABILITY&quot;.)</p>

<p>If a module does not work on MacPerl but should, or
needs to be compiled, see if the module exists already as a
port on the MacPerl Module Porters site (
http://pudge.net/mmp/ ). For more information on doing XS
with MacPerl yourself, see Arved Sandstrom s XS tutorial (
http://macperl.com/depts/Tutorials/ ), and then consider
uploading your binary to the CPAN and registering it on the
MMP site.</p>

<p>D. INSTALL</p>

<p>If you are using cpan-mac, just drop the folder on the
installme droplet, and use the module.</p>

<p>Or, if you arent using cpan-mac, do some manual
labor.</p>

<p>Make sure the newlines for the modules are in Mac
format, not Unix format. If they are not then you might have
decompressed them incorrectly. Check your decompression and
unpacking utilities settings to make sure they are
translating text files properly.</p>

<p>As a last resort, you can use the perl one-liner:</p>

<p>perl -i.bak -pe &rsquo;s/(?: 15)? 12/ 15/g&rsquo;
&lt;filenames&gt;</p>

<p>on the source files.</p>

<p>Then move the files (probably just the .pm files, though
there may be some additional ones, too; check the module
documentation) to their final destination: This will most
likely be in &quot;$ENV{MACPERL}site_lib:&quot; (i.e.,
&quot;HD:MacPerl folder:site_lib:&quot;). You can add new
paths to the default @INC in the Preferences menu item in
the MacPerl application (&quot;$ENV{MACPERL}site_lib:&quot;
is added automagically). Create whatever directory
structures are required (i.e., for &quot;Some::Module&quot;,
create &quot;$ENV{MACPERL}site_lib:Some:&quot; and put
&quot;Module.pm&quot; in that directory).</p>

<p>Then run the following script (or something like
it):</p>

<p>#!perl -w use AutoSplit; my $dir =
&quot;${MACPERL}site_perl&quot;;
autosplit(&quot;$dir:Some:Module.pm&quot;,
&quot;$dir:auto&quot;, 0, 1, 1);</p>

<p>&middot; If yore on the DJGPP port of DOS,</p>

<p>A. DECOMPRESS</p>

<p>djtarx (
ftp://ftp.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/gnu/djgpp/v2/ ) will both
uncompress and unpack.</p>

<p>B. UNPACK</p>

<p>See above.</p>

<p>C. BUILD</p>

<p>Go into the newly-created directory and type:</p>

<p>perl Makefile.PL make test</p>

<p>You will need the packages mentioned in README.dos in
the Perl distribution.</p>

<p>D. INSTALL</p>

<p>While still in that directory, type:</p>

<p>make install</p>

<p>You will need the packages mentioned in README.dos in
the Perl distribution.</p>

<p>&middot; If yore on OS/2,</p>

<p>Get the EMX development suite and gzip/tar, from either
Hobbes ( http://hobbes.nmsu.edu ) or Leo (
http://www.leo.org ), and then follow the instructions for
Unix.</p>

<p>&middot; If yore on VMS,</p>

<p>When downloading from CPAN, save your file with a
&quot;.tgz&quot; extension instead of &quot;.tar.gz&quot;.
All other periods in the filename should be replaced with
underscores. For example,
&quot;Your-Module-1.33.tar.gz&quot; should be downloaded as
&quot;Your-Module-1_33.tgz&quot;.</p>

<p>A. DECOMPRESS</p>

<p>Type</p>

<p>gzip -d Your-Module.tgz</p>

<p>or, for zipped modules, type</p>

<p>unzip Your-Module.zip</p>

<p>Executables for gzip, zip, and VMStar:</p>

<p>http://www.openvms.digital.com/freeware/
http://www.crinoid.com/utils/</p>

<p>and their source code:</p>

<p>http://www.fsf.org/order/ftp.html</p>

<p>Note that GNUs gzip/gunzip is not the same as Info-ZIP s
zip/unzip package. The former is a simple compression tool;
the latter permits creation of multi-file archives.</p>

<p>B. UNPACK</p>

<p>If youre using VMStar:</p>

<p>VMStar xf Your-Module.tar</p>

<p>Or, if youre fond of VMS command syntax:</p>

<p>tar/extract/verbose Your_Module.tar</p>

<p>C. BUILD</p>

<p>Make sure you have MMS (from Digital) or the freeware
MMK ( available from MadGoat at http://www.madgoat.com ).
Then type this to create the DESCRIP.MMS for the module:</p>

<p>perl Makefile.PL</p>

<p>Now youre ready to build:</p>

<p>mms test</p>

<p>Substitute &quot;mmk&quot; for &quot;mms&quot; above if
youre using MMK.</p>

<p>D. INSTALL</p>

<p>Type</p>

<p>mms install</p>

<p>Substitute &quot;mmk&quot; for &quot;mms&quot; above if
youre using MMK.</p>

<p>&middot; If yore on MVS,</p>

<p>Introduce the .tar.gz file into an HFS as binary; dont
translate from ASCII to EBCDIC.</p>

<p>A. DECOMPRESS</p>

<p>Decompress the file with &quot;gzip -d
yourmodule.tar.gz&quot;</p>

<p>You can get gzip from
http://www.s390.ibm.com/products/oe/bpxqp1.html</p>

<p>B. UNPACK</p>

<p>Unpack the result with</p>

<p>pax -o to=IBM-1047,from=ISO8859-1 -r &lt;
yourmodule.tar</p>

<p>The BUILD and INSTALL steps are identical to those for
Unix. Some modules generate Makefiles that work better with
GNU make, which is available from
http://www.mks.com/s390/gnu/</p>

<p>PORTABILITY Note that not all modules will work with on
all platforms. See perlport for more information on
portability issues. Read the documentation to see if the
module will work on your system. There are basically three
categories of modules that will not work &quot;out of the
box&quot; with all platforms (with some possibility of
overlap):</p>

<p>&middot; Those that should, but dot. These need to be
fixed; consider contacting the author and possibly writing a
patch.</p>

<p>&middot; Those that need to be compiled, where the
target platform doest have compilers readily available.
(These modules contain .xs or .c files, usually.) You might
be able to find existing binaries on the CPAN or elsewhere,
or you might want to try getting compilers and building it
yourself, and then release the binary for other poor souls
to use.</p>

<p>&middot; Those that are targeted at a specific platform.
(Such as the Win32:: modules.) If the module is targeted
specifically at a platform other than yours, youre out of
luck, most likely.</p>

<p>Check the CPAN Testers if a module should work with your
platform but it doesnt behave as youd expect, or you arent
sure whether or not a module will work under your platform.
If the module you want isnt listed there, you can test it
yourself and let CPAN Testers know, you can join CPAN
Testers, or you can request it be tested.</p>

<p>HEY If you have any suggested changes for this page, let
me know. Please dont send me mail asking for help on how to
install your modules. There are too many modules, and too
few Orwants, for me to be able to answer or even acknowledge
all your questions. Contact the module author instead, or
post to comp.lang.perl.modules, or ask someone familiar with
Perl on your operating system.</p>
