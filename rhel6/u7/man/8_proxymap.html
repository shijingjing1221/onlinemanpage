<p>PROXYMAP(8) PROXYMAP(8)</p>

<p>NAME proxymap - Postfix lookup table proxy server</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS proxymap [generic Postfix daemon options]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The proxymap(8) server provides read-only or
read-write table lookup service to Postfix processes. These
services are implemented with dis- tinct service names:
proxymap and proxywrite, respectively. The purpose of these
services is:</p>

<p>&middot; To overcome chroot restrictions. For example, a
chrooted SMTP server needs access to the system passwd file
in order to reject mail for non-existent local addresses,
but it is not practical to maintain a copy of the passwd
file in the chroot jail. The solution:</p>

<p>local_recipient_maps = proxy:unix:passwd.byname
$alias_maps</p>

<p>&middot; To consolidate the number of open lookup tables
by sharing one open table among multiple processes. For
example, making mysql connections from every Postfix daemon
process results in &quot;too many connections&quot; errors.
The solution:</p>

<p>virtual_alias_maps =
proxy:mysql:/etc/postfix/virtual_alias.cf</p>

<p>The total number of connections is limited by the number
of proxymap server processes.</p>

<p>&middot; To provide single-updater functionality for
lookup tables that do not reliably support multiple writers
(i.e. all file-based tables).</p>

<p>The proxymap(8) server implements the following
requests:</p>

<p>open maptype:mapname flags Open the table with type
maptype and name mapname, as controlled by flags. The reply
includes the maptype dependent flags (to distinguish a fixed
string table from a regular expression ta- ble).</p>

<p>lookup maptype:mapname flags key Look up the data stored
under the requested key. The reply is the request completion
status code and the lookup result value. The maptype:mapname
and flags are the same as with the open request.</p>

<p>update maptype:mapname flags key value Update the data
stored under the requested key. The reply is the request
completion status code. The maptype:mapname and flags are
the same as with the open request.</p>

<p>To implement single-updater maps, specify a process
limit of 1 in the master.cf file entry for the proxywrite
service.</p>

<p>This request is supported in Postfix 2.5 and later.</p>

<p>delete maptype:mapname flags key Delete the data stored
under the requested key. The reply is the request completion
status code. The maptype:mapname and flags are the same as
with the open request.</p>

<p>This request is supported in Postfix 2.5 and later.</p>

<p>The request completion status is one of OK, RETRY, NOKEY
(lookup failed because the key was not found), BAD
(malformed request) or DENY (the table is not approved for
proxy read or update access).</p>

<p>There is no close command, nor are tables implicitly
closed when a client disconnects. The purpose is to share
tables among multiple client processes.</p>

<p>SERVER PROCESS MANAGEMENT proxymap(8) servers run under
control by the Postfix master(8) server. Each server can
handle multiple simultaneous connections. When all servers
are busy while a client connects, the master(8) creates a
new proxymap(8) server process, provided that the process
limit is not exceeded. Each server terminates after serving
at least $max_use clients or after $max_idle seconds of idle
time.</p>

<p>SECURITY The proxymap(8) server opens only tables that
are approved via the proxy_read_maps or proxy_write_maps
configuration parameters, does not talk to users, and can
run at fixed low privilege, chrooted or not. However,
running the proxymap server chrooted severely limits usabil-
ity, because it can open only chrooted tables.</p>

<p>The proxymap(8) server is not a trusted daemon process,
and must not be used to look up sensitive information such
as user or group IDs, mail- box file/directory names or
external commands.</p>

<p>In Postfix version 2.2 and later, the proxymap client
recognizes requests to access a table for security-sensitive
purposes, and opens the table directly. This allows the same
main.cf setting to be used by sensitive and non-sensitive
processes.</p>

<p>Postfix-writable data files should be stored under a
dedicated direc- tory that is writable only by the Postfix
mail system, such as the Postfix-owned data_directory.</p>

<p>In particular, Postfix-writable files should never exist
in root-owned directories. That would open up a particular
type of security hole where ownership of a file or directory
does not match the provider of its content.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS Problems and transactions are logged to
syslogd(8).</p>

<p>BUGS The proxymap(8) server provides service to multiple
clients, and must therefore not be used for tables that have
high-latency lookups.</p>

<p>The proxymap(8) read-write service does not explicitly
close lookup tables (even if it did, this could not be
relied on, because the pro- cess may be terminated between
table updates). The read-write service should therefore not
be used with tables that leave persistent storage in an
inconsistent state between updates (for example, CDB).
Tables that support &quot;sync on update&quot; should be
safe (for example, Berkeley DB) as should tables that are
implemented by a real DBMS.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS On busy mail systems a long
time may pass before proxymap(8) relevant changes to main.cf
are picked up. Use the command &quot;postfix reload&quot; to
speed up a change.</p>

<p>The text below provides only a parameter summary. See
postconf(5) for more details including examples.</p>

<p>config_directory (seepostconf -doutput) The default
location of the Postfix main.cf and master.cf con-
figuration files.</p>

<p>data_directory (seepostconf -doutput) The directory with
Postfix-writable data files (for example: caches,
pseudo-random numbers).</p>

<p>daemon_timeout (18000s) How much time a Postfix daemon
process may take to handle a request before it is terminated
by a built-in watchdog timer.</p>

<p>ipc_timeout (3600s) The time limit for sending or
receiving information over an internal communication
channel.</p>

<p>max_idle (100s) The maximum amount of time that an idle
Postfix daemon process waits for an incoming connection
before terminating voluntarily.</p>

<p>max_use (100) The maximal number of incoming connections
that a Postfix daemon process will service before
terminating voluntarily.</p>

<p>process_id (read-only) The process ID of a Postfix
command or daemon process.</p>

<p>process_name (read-only) The process name of a Postfix
command or daemon process.</p>

<p>proxy_read_maps (seepostconf -doutput) The lookup tables
that the proxymap(8) server is allowed to access for the
read-only service.</p>

<p>Available in Postfix 2.5 and later:</p>

<p>data_directory (seepostconf -doutput) The directory with
Postfix-writable data files (for example: caches,
pseudo-random numbers).</p>

<p>proxy_write_maps (seepostconf -doutput) The lookup
tables that the proxymap(8) server is allowed to access for
the read-write service.</p>
