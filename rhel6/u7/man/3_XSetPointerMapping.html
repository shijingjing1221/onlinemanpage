<p>XSetPointerMapping(3) XLIB FUNCTIONS
XSetPointerMapping(3)</p>

<p>NAME XSetPointerMapping, XGetPointerMapping - manipulate
pointer settings</p>

<p>SYNTAX int XSetPointerMapping(Display *display, unsigned
char map[], int nmap);</p>

<p>int XGetPointerMapping(Display *display, unsigned char
map_return[], int nmap);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS display Specifies the connection to the X
server.</p>

<p>map Specifies the mapping list.</p>

<p>map_return Returns the mapping list.</p>

<p>nmap Specifies the number of items in the mapping
list.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The XSetPointerMapping function sets the
mapping of the pointer. If it succeeds, the X server
generates a MappingNotify event, and XSetPoint- erMapping
returns MappingSuccess. Element map[i] defines the logical
button number for the physical button i+1. The length of the
list must be the same as XGetPointerMapping would return, or
a BadValue error results. A zero element disables a button,
and elements are not restricted in value by the number of
physical buttons. However, no two elements can have the same
nonzero value, or a BadValue error results. If any of the
buttons to be altered are logically in the down state,
XSetPointerMapping returns MappingBusy, and the mapping is
not changed.</p>

<p>XSetPointerMapping can generate a BadValue error.</p>

<p>The XGetPointerMapping function returns the current
mapping of the pointer. Pointer buttons are numbered
starting from one. XGetPoint- erMapping returns the number
of physical buttons actually on the pointer. The nominal
mapping for a pointer is map[i]=i+1. The nmap argument
specifies the length of the array where the pointer mapping
is returned, and only the first nmap elements are returned
in map_return.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS BadValue Some numeric value falls outside
the range of values accepted by the request. Unless a
specific range is specified for an argument, the full range
defined by the argument s type is accepted. Any argument
defined as a set of alternatives can generate this
error.</p>
