<p>GETC_UNLOCKED(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
GETC_UNLOCKED(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME getc_unlocked, getchar_unlocked, putc_unlocked,
putchar_unlocked - stdio with explicit client locking</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</p>

<p>int getc_unlocked(FILE *stream); int
getchar_unlocked(void); int putc_unlocked(int c, FILE
*stream); int putchar_unlocked(int c);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Versions of the functions getc(), getchar(),
putc(), and putchar() respectively named getc_unlocked(),
getchar_unlocked(), putc_unlocked(), and putchar_unlocked()
shall be provided which are functionally equivalent to the
original versions, with the exception that they are not
required to be implemented in a thread-safe manner. They may
only safely be used within a scope protected by flockfile()
(or ftrylockfile()) and funlockfile(). These functions may
safely be used in a multi-threaded program if and only if
they are called while the invoking thread owns the ( FILE *)
object, as is the case after a successful call to the
flockfile() or ftrylockfile() functions.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE See getc(), getchar(), putc(), and
putchar().</p>

<p>ERRORS See getc(), getchar(), putc(), and putchar().</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE Since they may be implemented as
macros, getc_unlocked() and putc_unlocked() may treat
incorrectly a stream argument with side effects. In
particular, getc_unlocked(*f++) and putc_unlocked(*f++) do
not necessarily work as expected. Therefore, use of these
functions in such situations should be preceded by the
following statement as appro- priate:</p>

<p>#undef getc_unlocked #undef putc_unlocked</p>

<p>RATIONALE Some I/O functions are typically implemented
as macros for performance reasons (for example, putc() and
getc()). For safety, they need to be synchronized, but it is
often too expensive to synchronize on every character.
Nevertheless, it was felt that the safety concerns were more
important; consequently, the getc(), getchar(), putc(), and
putchar() functions are required to be thread-safe. However,
unlocked versions are also provided with names that clearly
indicate the unsafe nature of their operation but can be
used to exploit their higher performance. These unlocked
versions can be safely used only within explicitly locked
program regions, using exported locking primitives. In
particu- lar, a sequence such as:</p>

<p>flockfile(fileptr); putc_unlocked, fileptr);
putc_unlocked, fileptr); fprintf(fileptr, &quot;Line
n&quot;); funlockfile(fileptr);</p>

<p>is permissible, and results in the text sequence:</p>

<p>1 Line 2</p>

<p>being printed without being interspersed with output
from other threads.</p>

<p>It would be wrong to have the standard names such as
getc(), putc(), and so on, map to the &quot;faster, but
unsafe&quot; rather than the &quot;slower, but safe
versions. In either case, you would still want to inspect
all uses of getc(), putc(), and so on, by hand when
converting existing code. Choosing the safe bindings as the
default, at least, results in correct code and maintains the
&quot;atomicity at the function&quot; invariant. To do
otherwise would introduce gratuitous synchronization errors
into converted code. Other routines that modify the stdio (
FILE *) struc- tures or buffers are also safely
synchronized.</p>

<p>Note that there is no need for functions of the form
getc_locked(), putc_locked(), and so on, since this is the
functionality of getc(), putc(), et al. It would be
inappropriate to use a feature test macro to switch a macro
definition of getc() between getc_locked() and
getc_unlocked(), since the ISO C standard requires an actual
function to exist, a function whose behavior could not be
changed by the feature test macro. Also, providing both the
xxx_locked() and xxx_unlocked() forms leads to the confusion
of whether the suffix describes the behav- ior of the
function or the circumstances under which it should be
used.</p>

<p>Three additional routines, flockfile(), ftrylockfile(),
and funlock- file() (which may be macros), are provided to
allow the user to delin- eate a sequence of I/O statements
that are executed synchronously.</p>

<p>The ungetc() function is infrequently called relative to
the other functions/macros so no unlocked variation is
needed.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
