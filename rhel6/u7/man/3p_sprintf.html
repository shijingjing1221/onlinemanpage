<p>FPRINTF(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual FPRINTF(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME fprintf, printf, snprintf, sprintf - print
formatted output</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</p>

<p>int fprintf(FILE *restrict stream, const char *restrict
format, ...); int printf(const char *restrict format, ...);
int snprintf(char *restrict s, size_t n, const char
*restrict format, ...); int sprintf(char *restrict s, const
char *restrict format, ...);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The fprintf() function shall place output on
the named output stream. The printf() function shall place
output on the standard output stream stdout. The sprintf()
function shall place output followed by the null byte,, in
consecutive bytes starting at *s; it is the users
responsibility to ensure that enough space is available.</p>

<p>The snprintf() function shall be equivalent to
sprintf(), with the addition of the n argument which states
the size of the buffer referred to by s. If n is zero,
nothing shall be written and s may be a null pointer.
Otherwise, output bytes beyond the n-1st shall be discarded
instead of being written to the array, and a null byte is
written at the end of the bytes actually written into the
array.</p>

<p>If copying takes place between objects that overlap as a
result of a call to sprintf() or snprintf(), the results are
undefined.</p>

<p>Each of these functions converts, formats, and prints
its arguments under control of the format. The format is a
character string, begin- ning and ending in its initial
shift state, if any. The format is com- posed of zero or
more directives: ordinary characters, which are simply
copied to the output stream, and conversion specifications,
each of which shall result in the fetching of zero or more
arguments. The results are undefined if there are
insufficient arguments for the for- mat. If the format is
exhausted while arguments remain, the excess arguments shall
be evaluated but are otherwise ignored.</p>

<p>Conversions can be applied to the nth argument after the
format in the argument list, rather than to the next unused
argument. In this case, the conversion specifier character %
(see below) is replaced by the sequence &quot;%n$&quot;,
where n is a decimal integer in the range [1,{NL_ARGMAX}],
giving the position of the argument in the argument list.
This feature provides for the definition of format strings
that select arguments in an order appropriate to specific
languages (see the EXAMPLES section).</p>

<p>The format can contain either numbered argument
conversion specifica- tions (that is, &quot;%n$&quot; and
&quot;*m$&quot;), or unnumbered argument conversion
specifications (that is, % and * ), but not both. The only
exception to this is that %% can be mixed with the
&quot;%n$&quot; form. The results of mixing numbered and
unnumbered argument specifications in a format string are
undefined. When numbered argument specifications are used,
specifying the Nth argument requires that all the leading
arguments, from the first to the (N-1)th, are specified in
the format string.</p>

<p>In format strings containing the &quot;%n$&quot; form of
conversion specifica- tion, numbered arguments in the
argument list can be referenced from the format string as
many times as required.</p>

<p>In format strings containing the % form of conversion
specification, each conversion specification uses the first
unused argument in the argument list.</p>

<p>All forms of the fprintf() functions allow for the
insertion of a lan- guage-dependent radix character in the
output string. The radix charac- ter is defined in the
programs locale (category LC_NUMERIC ). In the POSIX locale,
or in a locale where the radix character is not defined, the
radix character shall default to a period (.).</p>

<p>Each conversion specification is introduced by the %
character or by the character sequence &quot;%n$&quot;,
after which the following appear in sequence:</p>

<p>* Zero or more flags (in any order), which modify the
meaning of the conversion specification.</p>

<p>* An optional minimum field width. If the converted
value has fewer bytes than the field width, it shall be
padded with spaces by default on the left; it shall be
padded on the right if the left- adjustment flag (-),
described below, is given to the field width. The field
width takes the form of an asterisk (*), described below, or
a decimal integer.</p>

<p>* An optional precision that gives the minimum number of
digits to appear for the d, i, o, u, x, and X conversion
specifiers; the num- ber of digits to appear after the radix
character for the a, A, e, E, f, and F conversion
specifiers; the maximum number of significant digits for the
g and G conversion specifiers; or the maximum number of
bytes to be printed from a string in the s and S conversion
specifiers. The precision takes the form of a period ( . )
fol- lowed either by an asterisk (*), described below, or an
optional decimal digit string, where a null digit string is
treated as zero. If a precision appears with any other
conversion specifier, the behavior is undefined.</p>

<p>* An optional length modifier that specifies the size of
the argument.</p>

<p>* A conversion specifier character that indicates the
type of conver- sion to be applied.</p>

<p>A field width, or precision, or both, may be indicated
by an asterisk ( *). In this case an argument of type int
supplies the field width or precision. Applications shall
ensure that arguments specifying field width, or precision,
or both appear in that order before the argument, if any, to
be converted. A negative field width is taken as a-flag
followed by a positive field width. A negative precision is
taken as if the precision were omitted. In format strings
containing the &quot;%n$&quot; form of a conversion
specification, a field width or precision may be indicated
by the sequence &quot;*m$&quot;, where m is a decimal
integer in the range [1,{NL_ARGMAX}] giving the position in
the argument list (after the format argument) of an integer
argument containing the field width or precision, for
example:</p>

<p>printf(&quot;%1$d:%2$.*3$d:%4$.*3$n&quot;, hour, min,
precision, sec);</p>

<p>The flag characters and their meanings are:</p>

<p>The integer portion of the result of a decimal
conversion ( %i, %d, %u, %f, %F, %g, or %G ) shall be
formatted with thousands grouping characters. For other
conversions the behavior is unde- fined. The non-monetary
grouping character is used.</p>

<p>- The result of the conversion shall be left-justified
within the field. The conversion is right-justified if this
flag is not specified.</p>

<p>+ The result of a signed conversion shall always begin
with a sign (+or-). The conversion shall begin with a sign
only when a negative value is converted if this flag is not
specified.</p>

<p>&lt;space&gt; If the first character of a signed
conversion is not a sign or if a signed conversion results
in no characters, a &lt;space&gt; shall be prefixed to the
result. This means that if the &lt;space&gt; and +flags both
appear, the &lt;space&gt; flag shall be ignored.</p>

<p># Specifies that the value is to be converted to an
alternative form. For o conversion, it increases the
precision (if neces- sary) to force the first digit of the
result to be zero. For x or X conversion specifiers, a
non-zero result shall have 0x (or 0X) prefixed to it. For a,
A, e, E, f, F, g, and G conversion specifiers, the result
shall always contain a radix character, even if no digits
follow the radix character. Without this flag, a radix
character appears in the result of these conversions only if
a digit follows it. For g and G conversion specifiers,
trailing zeros shall not be removed from the result as they
nor- mally are. For other conversion specifiers, the
behavior is undefined.</p>

<p>0 For d, i, o, u, x, X, a, A, e, E, f, F, g, and G
conversion specifiers, leading zeros (following any
indication of sign or base) are used to pad to the field
width; no space padding is performed. If the0and-flags both
appear, the0flag is ignored. For d, i, o, u, x, and X
conversion specifiers, if a precision is specified, the0flag
is ignored. If the0and &quot; flags both appear, the
grouping characters are inserted before zero padding. For
other conversions, the behavior is undefined.</p>

<p>The length modifiers and their meanings are:</p>

<p>hh Specifies that a following d, i, o, u, x, or X
conversion speci- fier applies to a signed char or unsigned
char argument (the argument will have been promoted
according to the integer promo- tions, but its value shall
be converted to signed char or unsigned char before
printing); or that a following n conversion specifier
applies to a pointer to a signed char argument.</p>

<p>h Specifies that a following d, i, o, u, x, or X
conversion speci- fier applies to a short or unsigned short
argument (the argument will have been promoted according to
the integer promotions, but its value shall be converted to
short or unsigned short before printing); or that a
following n conversion specifier applies to a pointer to a
short argument.</p>

<p>l (ell) Specifies that a following d, i, o, u, x, or X
conversion speci- fier applies to a long or unsigned long
argument; that a following n conversion specifier applies to
a pointer to a long argument; that a following c conversion
specifier applies to a wint_t argument; that a following s
conversion specifier applies to a pointer to a wchar_t
argument; or has no effect on a fol- lowing a, A, e, E, f,
F, g, or G conversion specifier.</p>

<p>ll (ell-ell)</p>

<p>Specifies that a following d, i, o, u, x, or X
conversion speci- fier applies to a long long or unsigned
long long argument; or that a following n conversion
specifier applies to a pointer to a long long argument.</p>

<p>j Specifies that a following d, i, o, u, x, or X
conversion speci- fier applies to an intmax_t or uintmax_t
argument; or that a following n conversion specifier applies
to a pointer to an int- max_t argument.</p>

<p>z Specifies that a following d, i, o, u, x, or X
conversion speci- fier applies to a size_t or the
corresponding signed integer type argument; or that a
following n conversion specifier applies to a pointer to a
signed integer type corresponding to a size_t argument.</p>

<p>t Specifies that a following d, i, o, u, x, or X
conversion speci- fier applies to a ptrdiff_t or the
corresponding unsigned type argument; or that a following n
conversion specifier applies to a pointer to a ptrdiff_t
argument.</p>

<p>L Specifies that a following a, A, e, E, f, F, g, or G
conversion specifier applies to a long double argument.</p>

<p>If a length modifier appears with any conversion
specifier other than as specified above, the behavior is
undefined.</p>

<p>The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:</p>

<p>d, i The int argument shall be converted to a signed
decimal in the style &quot;[-]dddd&quot;. The precision
specifies the minimum number of digits to appear; if the
value being converted can be repre- sented in fewer digits,
it shall be expanded with leading zeros. The default
precision is 1. The result of converting zero with an
explicit precision of zero shall be no characters.</p>

<p>o The unsigned argument shall be converted to unsigned
octal for- mat in the style &quot;dddd&quot;. The precision
specifies the minimum number of digits to appear; if the
value being converted can be represented in fewer digits, it
shall be expanded with leading zeros. The default precision
is 1. The result of converting zero with an explicit
precision of zero shall be no characters.</p>

<p>u The unsigned argument shall be converted to unsigned
decimal format in the style &quot;dddd&quot;. The precision
specifies the minimum number of digits to appear; if the
value being converted can be represented in fewer digits, it
shall be expanded with leading zeros. The default precision
is 1. The result of converting zero with an explicit
precision of zero shall be no characters.</p>

<p>x The unsigned argument shall be converted to unsigned
hexadecimal format in the style &quot;dddd&quot;; the
letters &quot;abcdef&quot; are used. The precision specifies
the minimum number of digits to appear; if the value being
converted can be represented in fewer digits, it shall be
expanded with leading zeros. The default precision is 1. The
result of converting zero with an explicit precision of zero
shall be no characters.</p>

<p>X Equivalent to the x conversion specifier, except that
letters &quot;ABCDEF&quot; are used instead of
&quot;abcdef&quot; .</p>

<p>f, F The double argument shall be converted to decimal
notation in the style &quot;[-]ddd.ddd&quot;, where the
number of digits after the radix character is equal to the
precision specification. If the precision is missing, it
shall be taken as 6; if the precision is explicitly zero and
no#flag is present, no radix charac- ter shall appear. If a
radix character appears, at least one digit appears before
it. The low-order digit shall be rounded in an
implementation-defined manner.</p>

<p>A double argument representing an infinity shall be
converted in one of the styles &quot;[-]inf&quot; or
&quot;[-]infinity&quot; ; which style is implementation-
defined. A double argument representing a NaN shall be
converted in one of the styles
&quot;[-]nan(n-char-sequence)&quot; or &quot;[-]nan&quot; ;
which style, and the meaning of any n-char-sequence, is
implementation-defined. The F conversion specifier produces
&quot;INF&quot;, &quot;INFINITY&quot;, or &quot;NAN&quot;
instead of &quot;inf&quot;, &quot;infinity&quot;, or
&quot;nan&quot;, respectively.</p>

<p>e, E The double argument shall be converted in the style
&quot;[-]d.ddde&plusmn;dd&quot;, where there is one digit
before the radix char- acter (which is non-zero if the
argument is non-zero) and the number of digits after it is
equal to the precision; if the pre- cision is missing, it
shall be taken as 6; if the precision is zero and no # flag
is present, no radix character shall appear. The low-order
digit shall be rounded in an implementa- tion-defined
manner. The E conversion specifier shall produce a number
with E instead of eintroducing the exponent. The exponent
shall always contain at least two digits. If the value is
zero, the exponent shall be zero.</p>

<p>A double argument representing an infinity or NaN shall
be converted in the style of an f or F conversion
specifier.</p>

<p>g, G The double argument shall be converted in the style
f or e (or in the style F or E in the case of a G conversion
specifier), with the precision specifying the number of
significant digits. If an explicit precision is zero, it
shall be taken as 1. The style used depends on the value
converted; style e (or E ) shall be used only if the
exponent resulting from such a conversion is less than -4 or
greater than or equal to the precision. Trailing zeros shall
be removed from the fractional portion of the result; a
radix character shall appear only if it is followed by a
digit or a#flag is present.</p>

<p>A double argument representing an infinity or NaN shall
be converted in the style of an f or F conversion
specifier.</p>

<p>a, A A double argument representing a floating-point
number shall be converted in the style
&quot;[-]0xh.hhhhp&plusmn;d&quot;, where there is one hex-
adecimal digit (which shall be non-zero if the argument is a
normalized floating-point number and is otherwise
unspecified) before the decimal-point character and the
number of hexadecimal digits after it is equal to the
precision; if the precision is missing and FLT_RADIX is a
power of 2, then the precision shall be sufficient for an
exact representation of the value; if the precision is
missing and FLT_RADIX is not a power of 2, then the
precision shall be sufficient to distinguish values of type
dou- ble, except that trailing zeros may be omitted; if the
precision is zero and the # flag is not specified, no
decimal-point character shall appear. The letters
&quot;abcdef&quot; shall be used for a conversion and the
letters &quot;ABCDEF&quot; for A conversion. The A con-
version specifier produces a number with X and P instead of
x and p . The exponent shall always contain at least one
digit, and only as many more digits as necessary to
represent the decimal exponent of 2. If the value is zero,
the exponent shall be zero.</p>

<p>A double argument representing an infinity or NaN shall
be converted in the style of an f or F conversion
specifier.</p>

<p>c The int argument shall be converted to an unsigned
char, and the resulting byte shall be written.</p>

<p>If an l (ell) qualifier is present, the wint_t argument
shall be con- verted as if by an ls conversion specification
with no precision and an argument that points to a
two-element array of type wchar_t, the first element of
which contains the wint_t argument to the ls conversion
specification and the second element contains a null wide
character.</p>

<p>s The argument shall be a pointer to an array of char.
Bytes from the array shall be written up to (but not
including) any termi- nating null byte. If the precision is
specified, no more than that many bytes shall be written. If
the precision is not speci- fied or is greater than the size
of the array, the application shall ensure that the array
contains a null byte.</p>

<p>If an l (ell) qualifier is present, the argument shall
be a pointer to an array of type wchar_t. Wide characters
from the array shall be con- verted to characters (each as
if by a call to the wcrtomb() function, with the conversion
state described by an mbstate_t object initialized to zero
before the first wide character is converted) up to and
includ- ing a terminating null wide character. The resulting
characters shall be written up to (but not including) the
terminating null character (byte). If no precision is
specified, the application shall ensure that the array
contains a null wide character. If a precision is specified,
no more than that many characters (bytes) shall be written
(including shift sequences, if any), and the array shall
contain a null wide char- acter if, to equal the character
sequence length given by the preci- sion, the function would
need to access a wide character one past the end of the
array. In no case shall a partial character be written.</p>

<p>p The argument shall be a pointer to void. The value of
the pointer is converted to a sequence of printable
characters, in an implementation-defined manner.</p>

<p>n The argument shall be a pointer to an integer into
which is written the number of bytes written to the output
so far by this call to one of the fprintf() functions. No
argument is con- verted.</p>

<p>C Equivalent to lc .</p>

<p>S Equivalent to ls .</p>

<p>% Print a % character; no argument is converted. The
complete conversion specification shall be %% .</p>

<p>If a conversion specification does not match one of the
above forms, the behavior is undefined. If any argument is
not the correct type for the corresponding conversion
specification, the behavior is undefined.</p>

<p>In no case shall a nonexistent or small field width
cause truncation of a field; if the result of a conversion
is wider than the field width, the field shall be expanded
to contain the conversion result. Charac- ters generated by
fprintf() and printf() are printed as if fputc() had been
called.</p>

<p>For the a and A conversion specifiers, if FLT_RADIX is a
power of 2, the value shall be correctly rounded to a
hexadecimal floating number with the given precision.</p>

<p>For a and A conversions, if FLT_RADIX is not a power of
2 and the result is not exactly representable in the given
precision, the result should be one of the two adjacent
numbers in hexadecimal floating style with the given
precision, with the extra stipulation that the error should
have a correct sign for the current rounding direction.</p>

<p>For the e, E, f, F, g, and G conversion specifiers, if
the number of significant decimal digits is at most
DECIMAL_DIG, then the result should be correctly rounded. If
the number of significant decimal dig- its is more than
DECIMAL_DIG but the source value is exactly repre- sentable
with DECIMAL_DIG digits, then the result should be an exact
representation with trailing zeros. Otherwise, the source
value is bounded by two adjacent decimal strings L &lt; U,
both having DECIMAL_DIG significant digits; the value of the
resultant decimal string D should satisfy L &lt;= D &lt;= U,
with the extra stipulation that the error should have a
correct sign for the current rounding direction.</p>

<p>The st_ctime and st_mtime fields of the file shall be
marked for update between the call to a successful execution
of fprintf() or printf() and the next successful completion
of a call to fflush() or fclose() on the same stream or a
call to exit() or abort().</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, the fprintf()
and printf() functions shall return the number of bytes
transmitted.</p>

<p>Upon successful completion, the sprintf() function shall
return the number of bytes written to s, excluding the
terminating null byte.</p>

<p>Upon successful completion, the snprintf() function
shall return the number of bytes that would be written to s
had n been sufficiently large excluding the terminating null
byte.</p>

<p>If an output error was encountered, these functions
shall return a neg- ative value.</p>

<p>If the value of n is zero on a call to snprintf(),
nothing shall be written, the number of bytes that would
have been written had n been sufficiently large excluding
the terminating null shall be returned, and s may be a null
pointer.</p>

<p>ERRORS For the conditions under which fprintf() and
printf() fail and may fail, refer to fputc() or
fputwc().</p>

<p>In addition, all forms of fprintf() may fail if:</p>

<p>EILSEQ A wide-character code that does not correspond to
a valid char- acter has been detected.</p>

<p>EINVAL There are insufficient arguments.</p>

<p>The printf() and fprintf() functions may fail if:</p>

<p>ENOMEM Insufficient storage space is available.</p>

<p>The snprintf() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EOVERFLOW The value of n is greater than {INT_MAX} or
the number of bytes needed to hold the output excluding the
terminating null is greater than {INT_MAX}.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Printing Language-Independent Date and Time The
following statement can be used to print date and time using
a lan- guage-independent format:</p>

<p>printf(format, weekday, month, day, hour, min);</p>

<p>For American usage, format could be a pointer to the
following string:</p>

<p>&quot;%s, %s %d, %d:%.2n&quot;</p>

<p>This example would produce the following message:</p>

<p>Sunday, July 3, 10:02</p>

<p>For German usage, format could be a pointer to the
following string:</p>

<p>&quot;%1$s, %3$d. %2$s, %4$d:%5$.2n&quot;</p>

<p>This definition of format would produce the following
message:</p>

<p>Sonntag, 3. Juli, 10:02</p>

<p>Printing File Information The following example prints
information about the type, permissions, and number of links
of a specific file in a directory.</p>

<p>The first two calls to printf() use data decoded from a
previous stat() call. The user-defined strperm() function
shall return a string simi- lar to the one at the beginning
of the output for the following com- mand:</p>

<p>ls -l</p>

<p>The next call to printf() outputs the owners name if it
is found using getpwuid(); the getpwuid() function shall
return a passwd structure from which the name of the user is
extracted. If the user name is not found, the program
instead prints out the numeric value of the user ID.</p>

<p>The next call prints out the group name if it is found
using get- grgid(); getgrgid() is very similar to getpwuid()
except that it shall return group information based on the
group number. Once again, if the group is not found, the
program prints the numeric value of the group for the
entry.</p>

<p>The final call to printf() prints the size of the
file.</p>

<p>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;pwd.h&gt; #include &lt;grp.h&gt;</p>

<p>char *strperm (mode_t); ... struct stat statbuf; struct
passwd *pwd; struct group *grp; ...
printf(&quot;%10.10s&quot;, strperm (statbuf.st_mode));
printf(&quot;%4d&quot;, statbuf.st_nlink);</p>

<p>if ((pwd = getpwuid(statbuf.st_uid)) != NULL)
printf(&quot; %-8.8s&quot;, pwd-&gt;pw_name); else
printf(&quot; %-8ld&quot;, (long) statbuf.st_uid);</p>

<p>if ((grp = getgrgid(statbuf.st_gid)) != NULL)
printf(&quot; %-8.8s&quot;, grp-&gt;gr_name); else
printf(&quot; %-8ld&quot;, (long) statbuf.st_gid);</p>

<p>printf(&quot;%9jd&quot;, (intmax_t) statbuf.st_size);
...</p>

<p>Printing a Localized Date String The following example
gets a localized date string. The nl_langinfo() function
shall return the localized date string, which specifies the
order and layout of the date. The strftime() function takes
this infor- mation and, using the tm structure for values,
places the date and time information into datestring. The
printf() function then outputs dat- estring and the name of
the entry.</p>

<p>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; #include &lt;time.h&gt;
#include &lt;langinfo.h&gt; ... struct dirent *dp; struct tm
*tm; char datestring[256]; ... strftime(datestring,
sizeof(datestring), nl_langinfo (D_T_FMT), tm);</p>

<p>printf(&quot; %s %n&quot;, datestring, dp-&gt;d_name);
...</p>

<p>Printing Error Information The following example uses
fprintf() to write error information to standard error.</p>

<p>In the first group of calls, the program tries to open
the password lock file named LOCKFILE. If the file already
exists, this is an error, as indicated by the O_EXCL flag on
the open() function. If the call fails, the program assumes
that someone else is updating the password file, and the
program exits.</p>

<p>The next group of calls saves a new password file as the
current pass- word file by creating a link between LOCKFILE
and the new password file PASSWDFILE.</p>

<p>#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; #include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;
#include &lt;fcntl.h&gt; #include &lt;stdio.h&gt; #include
&lt;stdlib.h&gt; #include &lt;unistd.h&gt; #include
&lt;string.h&gt; #include &lt;errno.h&gt;</p>

<p>#define LOCKFILE &quot;/etc/ptmp&quot; #define
PASSWDFILE &quot;/etc/passwd&quot; ... int pfd; ... if ((pfd
= open(LOCKFILE, O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_EXCL, S_IRUSR |
S_IWUSR | S_IRGRP | S_IROTH)) == -1) { fprintf(stderr,
&quot;Cannot open /etc/ptmp. Try again latern&quot;);
exit(1); } ... if (link(LOCKFILE,PASSWDFILE) == -1) {
fprintf(stderr, &quot;Link error: %n&quot;,
strerror(errno)); exit(1); } ...</p>

<p>Printing Usage Information The following example checks
to make sure the program has the necessary arguments, and
uses fprintf() to print usage information if the expected
number of arguments is not present.</p>

<p>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt; ...
char *Options = &quot;hdbtl&quot;; ... if (argc &lt; 2) {
fprintf(stderr, &quot;Usage: %s -%s &lt;filn&quot;, argv[0],
Options); exit(1); } ...</p>

<p>Formatting a Decimal String The following example prints
a key and data pair on stdout. Note use of the * (asterisk)
in the format string; this ensures the correct number of
decimal places for the element based on the number of ele-
ments requested.</p>

<p>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; ... long i; char *keystr; int
elementlen, len; ... while (len &lt; elementlen) { ...
printf(&quot;%s Element%0*ln&quot;, keystr, elementlen, i);
... }</p>

<p>Creating a Filename The following example creates a
filename using information from a pre- vious getpwnam()
function that returned the HOME directory of the user.</p>

<p>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt; ... char filename[PATH_MAX+1];
struct passwd *pw; ... sprintf(filename,
&quot;%s/%d.out&quot;, pw-&gt;pw_dir, getpid()); ...</p>

<p>Reporting an Event The following example loops until an
event has timed out. The pause() function waits forever
unless it receives a signal. The fprintf() statement should
never occur due to the possible return values of
pause().</p>

<p>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt; #include &lt;errno.h&gt; ... while
(!event_complete) { ... if (pause() != -1 || errno != EINTR)
fprintf(stderr, &quot;pause: unknown error: %n&quot;,
strerror(errno)); } ...</p>

<p>Printing Monetary Information The following example uses
strfmon() to convert a number and store it as a formatted
monetary string named convbuf. If the first number is
printed, the program prints the format and the description;
otherwise, it just prints the number.</p>

<p>#include &lt;monetary.h&gt; #include &lt;stdio.h&gt; ...
struct tblfmt { char *format; char *description; };</p>

<p>struct tblfmt table[] = { { &quot;%n&quot;,
&quot;default formatting&quot; }, { &quot;%11n&quot;,
&quot;right align within an 11 character field&quot; }, {
&quot;%#5n&quot;, &quot;aligned columns for values up to
99999&quot; }, { &quot;%=*#5n&quot;, &quot;specify a fill
character&quot; }, { &quot;%=0#5n&quot;, &quot;fill
characters do not use grouping&quot; }, { &quot;%^#5n&quot;,
&quot;disable the grouping separator&quot; }, {
&quot;%^#5.0n&quot;, &quot;round off to whole units&quot; },
{ &quot;%^#5.4n&quot;, &quot;increase the precision&quot; },
{ &quot;%(#5n&quot;, &quot;use an alternative pos/neg
style&quot; }, { &quot;%!(#5n&quot;, &quot;disable the
currency symbol&quot; }, }; ... float input[3]; int i, j;
char convbuf[100]; ... strfmon(convbuf, sizeof(convbuf),
table[i].format, input[j]);</p>

<p>if (j == 0) { printf(&quot;%s %s %n&quot;,
table[i].format, convbuf, table[i].description); } else {
printf(&quot; %n&quot;, convbuf); } ...</p>

<p>Printing Wide Characters The following example prints a
series of wide characters. Suppose that &quot;&quot; expands
to three bytes:</p>

<p>wchar_t wz [3] = L&quot;@@&quot;; // Zero-terminated
wchar_t wn [3] = L&quot;@@@&quot;; // Unterminated</p>

<p>fprintf (stdout,&quot;%ls&quot;, wz); // Outputs 6 bytes
fprintf (stdout,&quot;%ls&quot;, wn); // Undefined because
wn has no terminator fprintf (stdout,&quot;%4ls&quot;, wz);
// Outputs 3 bytes fprintf (stdout,&quot;%4ls&quot;, wn); //
Outputs 3 bytes; no terminator needed fprintf
(stdout,&quot;%9ls&quot;, wz); // Outputs 6 bytes fprintf
(stdout,&quot;%9ls&quot;, wn); // Outputs 9 bytes; no
terminator needed fprintf (stdout,&quot;%10ls&quot;, wz); //
Outputs 6 bytes fprintf (stdout,&quot;%10ls&quot;, wn); //
Undefined because wn has no terminator</p>

<p>In the last line of the example, after processing three
characters, nine bytes have been output. The fourth
character must then be examined to determine whether it
converts to one byte or more. If it converts to more than
one byte, the output is only nine bytes. Since there is no
fourth character in the array, the behavior is
undefined.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE If the application calling fprintf()
has any objects of type wint_t or wchar_t, it must also
include the &lt;wchar.h&gt; header to have these objects
defined.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
