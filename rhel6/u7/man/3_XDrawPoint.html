<p>XDrawPoint(3) XLIB FUNCTIONS XDrawPoint(3)</p>

<p>NAME XDrawPoint, XDrawPoints, XPoint - draw points and
points structure</p>

<p>SYNTAX int XDrawPoint(Display *display, Drawable d, GC
gc, int x, int y);</p>

<p>int XDrawPoints(Display *display, Drawable d, GC gc,
XPoint *points, int npoints, int mode);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS d Specifies the drawable.</p>

<p>display Specifies the connection to the X server.</p>

<p>gc Specifies the GC.</p>

<p>mode Specifies the coordinate mode. You can pass
CoordModeOrigin or CoordModePrevious.</p>

<p>npoints Specifies the number of points in the array.</p>

<p>points Specifies an array of points.</p>

<p>x y Specify the x and y coordinates where you want the
point drawn.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The XDrawPoint function uses the foreground
pixel and function compo- nents of the GC to draw a single
point into the specified drawable; XDrawPoints draws
multiple points this way. CoordModeOrigin treats all
coordinates as relative to the origin, and CoordModePrevious
treats all coordinates after the first as relative to the
previous point. XDraw- Points draws the points in the order
listed in the array.</p>

<p>Both functions use these GC components: function,
plane-mask, fore- ground, subwindow-mode, clip-x-origin,
clip-y-origin, and clip-mask.</p>

<p>XDrawPoint can generate BadDrawable, BadGC, and BadMatch
errors. XDrawPoints can generate BadDrawable, BadGC,
BadMatch, and BadValue errors.</p>

<p>STRUCTURES The XPoint structure contains:</p>

<p>typedef struct { short x, y; } XPoint;</p>

<p>All x and y members are signed integers. The width and
height members are 16-bit unsigned integers. You should be
careful not to generate coordinates and sizes out of the
16-bit ranges, because the protocol only has 16-bit fields
for these values.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS BadDrawable A value for a Drawable argument
does not name a defined Win- dow or Pixmap.</p>

<p>BadGC A value for a GContext argument does not name a
defined GCon- text.</p>

<p>BadMatch An InputOnly window is used as a Drawable.</p>

<p>BadMatch Some argument or pair of arguments has the
correct type and range but fails to match in some other way
required by the request.</p>

<p>BadValue Some numeric value falls outside the range of
values accepted by the request. Unless a specific range is
specified for an argument, the full range defined by the
argument s type is accepted. Any argument defined as a set
of alternatives can generate this error.</p>
