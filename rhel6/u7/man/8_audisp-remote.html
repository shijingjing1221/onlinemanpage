<p>NAME audisp-remote - plugin for remote logging</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS audisp-remote</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION audisp-remote is a plugin for the audit
event dispatcher daemon, aud- ispd, that preforms remote
logging to an aggregate logging server.</p>

<p>TIPS If you are aggregating multiple machines, you
should enable node infor- mation in the audit event stream.
You can do this in one of two places. If you want computer
node names written to disk as well as sent in the realtime
event stream, edit the name_format option in
/etc/audit/auditd.conf. If you only want the node names in
the realtime event stream, then edit the name_format option
in /etc/audisp/aud- ispd.conf. Do not enable both as it will
put 2 node fields in the event stream.</p>

<p>SIGNALS SIGUSR1 Causes the audisp-remote program to
write the value of some of its internal flags to syslog. The
suspend flag tells whether or not logging has been
suspended. The transport_ok flag tells whether or not the
connection to the remote server is healthy. The queue_size
tells how many records are enqueued to be sent to the remote
server.</p>

<p>SIGUSR2 Causes the audisp-remote program to resume
logging if it were suspended due to an error.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/audisp/plugins.d/au-remote.conf,
/etc/audit/auditd.conf, /etc/aud- isp/audispd.conf,
/etc/audisp/audisp-remote.conf</p>

<p>SEE ALSO audispd(8), auditd.conf(8), audispd.conf(8),
