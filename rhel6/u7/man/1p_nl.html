<p>NL(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual NL(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME nl - line numbering filter</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS nl [-p][-b type][-d delim][-f type][-h type][-i
incr][-l num][-n for- mat] [-s sep][-v startnum][-w
width][file]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The nl utility shall read lines from the
named file or the standard input if no file is named and
shall reproduce the lines to standard output. Lines shall be
numbered on the left. Additional functionality may be
provided in accordance with the command options in
effect.</p>

<p>The nl utility views the text it reads in terms of
logical pages. Line numbering shall be reset at the start of
each logical page. A logical page consists of a header, a
body, and a footer section. Empty sections are valid.
Different line numbering options are independently available
for header, body, and footer (for example, no numbering of
header and footer lines while numbering blank lines only in
the body).</p>

<p>The starts of logical page sections shall be signaled by
input lines containing nothing but the following delimiter
characters:</p>

<p>Line Start of Header Body Footer</p>

<p>Unless otherwise specified, nl shall assume the text
being read is in a single logical page body.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The nl utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines. Only one file can be named.</p>

<p>The following options shall be supported:</p>

<p>-b type Specify which logical page body lines shall be
numbered. Recog- nized types and their meaning are:</p>

<p>a Number all lines.</p>

<p>t Number only non-empty lines.</p>

<p>n No line numbering.</p>

<p>pstring Number only lines that contain the basic regular
expression specified in string.</p>

<p>The default type for logical page body shall be t (text
lines num- bered).</p>

<p>-d delim Specify the delimiter characters that indicate
the start of a logical page section. These can be changed
from the default characters :&quot; to two user-specified
characters. If only one character is entered, the second
character shall remain the default character:.</p>

<p>-f type Specify the same as b type except for footer.
The default for logical page footer shall be n (no lines
numbered).</p>

<p>-h type Specify the same as b type except for header.
The default type for logical page header shall be n (no
lines numbered).</p>

<p>-i incr Specify the increment value used to number
logical page lines. The default shall be 1.</p>

<p>-l num Specify the number of blank lines to be
considered as one. For example, -l 2 results in only the
second adjacent blank line being numbered (if the
appropriate -h a, -b a, or -f a option is set). The default
shall be 1.</p>

<p>-n format Specify the line numbering format. Recognized
values are: ln, left justified, leading zeros suppressed;
rn, right justified, leading zeros suppressed; rz, right
justified, leading zeros kept. The default format shall be
rn (right justified).</p>

<p>-p Specify that numbering should not be restarted at
logical page delimiters.</p>

<p>-s sep Specify the characters used in separating the
line number and the corresponding text line. The default sep
shall be a &lt;tab&gt;.</p>

<p>-v startnum Specify the initial value used to number
logical page lines. The default shall be 1.</p>

<p>-w width Specify the number of characters to be used for
the line number. The default width shall be 6.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p>file A pathname of a text file to be line-numbered.</p>

<p>STDIN The standard input is a text file that is used if
no file operand is given.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES The input file named by the file operand is
a text file.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of nl:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_COLLATE</p>

<p>Determine the locale for the behavior of ranges,
equivalence classes, and multi-character collating elements
within regular expressions.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments
and input files), the behavior of character classes within
regular expressions, and for deciding which characters are
in character class graph (for the -b t, -f t, and -h t
options).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT The standard output shall be a text file in the
following format:</p>

<p>&quot;%s%s%s&quot;, &lt;line number&gt;,
&lt;separator&gt;, &lt;input line&gt;</p>

<p>where &lt;line number&gt; is one of the following
numeric formats:</p>

<p>%6d When the rn format is used (the default; see
-n).</p>

<p>%06d When the rz format is used.</p>

<p>%-6d When the ln format is used.</p>

<p>&lt;empty&gt; When line numbers are suppressed for a
portion of the page; the &lt;separator&gt; is also
suppressed.</p>

<p>In the preceding list, the number 6 is the default
width; the -w option can change this value.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 Successful completion.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE In using the -d delim option, care
should be taken to escape characters that have special
meaning to the command interpreter.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES The command:</p>

<p>nl -v 10 -i 10 -!+ file1</p>

<p>numbers file1 starting at line number 10 with an
increment of 10. The logical page delimiter is
&quot;!+&quot; . Note that the!has to be escaped when using
csh as a command interpreter because of its history substi-
tution syntax. For ksh and sh the escape is not necessary,
but does not do any harm.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
