<p>NAME wcrtomb - convert a wide character to a multibyte
sequence</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;wchar.h&gt;</p>

<p>size_t wcrtomb(char *s, wchar_t wc, mbstate_t *ps);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The main case for this function is when s is
not NULL and wc is not L&rsquo; &rsquo;. In this case, the
wcrtomb() function converts the wide charac- ter wc to its
multibyte representation and stores it at the beginning of
the character array pointed to by s. It updates the shift
state *ps, and returns the length of said multibyte
representation, that is, the number of bytes written at
s.</p>

<p>A different case is when s is not NULL but wc is
L&rsquo; &rsquo;. In this case the wcrtomb() function stores
at the character array pointed to by s the shift sequence
needed to bring *ps back to the initial state, fol- lowed by
a &rsquo; &rsquo; byte. It updates the shift state *ps
(i.e., brings it into the initial state), and returns the
length of the shift sequence plus one, that is, the number
of bytes written at s.</p>

<p>A third case is when s is NULL. In this case wc is
ignored, and the function effectively returns
wcrtomb(buf,L&rsquo; &rsquo;,ps) where buf is an internal
anonymous buffer.</p>

<p>In all of the above cases, if ps is a NULL pointer, a
static anonymous state only known to the wcrtomb() function
is used instead.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The wcrtomb() function returns the number
of bytes that have been or would have been written to the
byte array at s. If wc can not be rep- resented as a
multibyte sequence (according to the current locale),
(size_t) -1 is returned, and errno set to EILSEQ.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO C99.</p>

<p>NOTES The behavior of wcrtomb() depends on the LC_CTYPE
category of the cur- rent locale.</p>

<p>Passing NULL as ps is not multithread safe.</p>
