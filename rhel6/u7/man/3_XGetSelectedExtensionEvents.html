<p>XSELECTEXTENSIONEVEN(3) XSELECTEXTENSIONEVEN(3)</p>

<p>NAME XSelectExtensionEvent, XGetSelectedExtensionEvents
- select extension events, get the list of currently
selected extension events</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;X11/extensions/XInput.h&gt;</p>

<p>XSelectExtensionEvent( Display *display, Window w,
XEventClass *event_list, int event_count);</p>

<p>XGetSelectedExtensionEvents( Display *display, Window w,
int *this_client_event_count_return, XEventClass
**this_client_event_list_return, int
*all_clients_event_count_return, XEventClass
**all_clients_event_list_return);</p>

<p>display Specifies the connection to the X server.</p>

<p>w Specifies the window whose events you are interested
in.</p>

<p>event_list Specifies the list of event classes that
describe the events you are interested in.</p>

<p>event_count Specifies the count of event classes in the
event list.</p>

<p>this_client_event_count_return Returns the count of
event classes selected by this client.</p>

<p>this_client_event_list_return Returns a pointer to the
list of event classes selected by this client.</p>

<p>all_clients_event_count_return Returns the count of
event classes selected by all clients.</p>

<p>all_clients_event_list_return Returns a pointer to the
list of event classes selected by all clients.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The XSelectExtensionEvent request causes the
X server to report the events associated with the specified
list of event classes. Initially, X will not report any of
these events. Events are reported relative to a window. If a
window is not interested in a device event, it usually
propagates to the closest ancestor that is interested,
unless the do_not_propagate mask prohibits it.</p>

<p>Multiple clients can select for the same events on the
same window with the following restrictions: * Multiple
clients can select events on the same window because their
event masks are disjoint. When the X server generates an
event, it reports it to all interested clients. * Only one
client at a time can select a DeviceButtonPress event with
automatic passive grabbing enabled, which is associated with
the event class DeviceButtonPressGrab. To receive
DeviceButtonPress events without automatic passive grabbing,
use event class DeviceButtonPress but do not specify event
class DeviceButtonPressGrab.</p>

<p>The server reports the event to all interested
clients.</p>

<p>Information contained in the XDevice structure returned
by XOpenDevice is used by macros to obtain the event classes
that clients use in making XSelectExtensionEvent requests.
Currently defined macros include DeviceKeyPress,
DeviceKeyRelease, DeviceButtonPress, DeviceButtonRelese,
DeviceMotionNotify, DeviceFocusIn, DeviceFocusOut,
ProximityIn, ProximityOut, DeviceStateNotify,
DeviceMappingNotify, ChangeDeviceNotify,
DevicePointerMotionHint, DeviceButton1Motion,
DeviceButton2Motion, DeviceButton3Motion,
DeviceButton4Motion, DeviceButton5Motion,
DeviceButtonMotion, DeviceOwnerGrabButton,
DeviceButtonPressGrab, and NoExtensionEvent.</p>

<p>To obtain the proper event class for a particular
device, one of the above macros is invoked using the XDevice
structure for that device. For example, DeviceKeyPress
(*device, type, eventclass);</p>

<p>returns the DeviceKeyPress event type and the eventclass
for selecting DeviceKeyPress events from this device.</p>

<p>XSelectExtensionEvent can generate a BadWindow or
BadClass error. The XGetSelectedExtensionEvents request
reports the extension events selected by this client and all
clients for the specified window. This request returns
pointers to two XEventClass arrays. One lists the input
extension events selected by this client from the specified
window. The other lists the event classes selected by all
clients from the specified window. You should use XFree to
free these two arrays.</p>

<p>XGetSelectedExtensionEvents can generate a BadWindow
error.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS BadWindow A value for a Window argument does
not name a defined window.</p>

<p>BadClass A value for an XEventClass is invalid.</p>
