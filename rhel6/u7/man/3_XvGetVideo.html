<p>NAME XvGetVideo - capture video from a drawable</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;X11/extensions/Xvlib.h&gt;</p>

<p>int XvGetVideo(Display *dpy, XvPortID port, Drawable d,
GC gc, int vx, int vy, unsigned int vw, unsigned int vh, int
dx, int dy, unsigned int dw, unsigned int dh);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS dpy Specifies the connection to the X
server.</p>

<p>port Defines the port to which video output is sent.</p>

<p>d Defines the drawable (window) from which video output
is to be obtained.</p>

<p>gc Defines the graphical context. GC components are:
sub- window-mode, clip-x-origin, clip-y-origin, and clip-
mask.</p>

<p>vx,vy,vw,vh Define the location and size of the video
region is to be written. vx and vy define the xand y
coordinates of the upper-left corner of the video region;
vwand vh define the width and height, in pixels, of the
video region.</p>

<p>dx,dy,dw,dh Define the location of the source drawable
from which the video image is to be taken. dxand dy define
the xand y coordinates of the upper-left corner of the draw-
able region; dwand dh define the width and height, in
pixels, of the drawable region.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION outputs video from a drawable. The position
and size of the destina- tion rectangle is specified by vx,
vy, vw, and vh. The position and size of the source
rectangle is specified by dx, dy, dw, and dh.</p>

<p>Drawable data is clipped to the bounds of the drawable,
scaled to the requested video region size (or the closest
size supported) and clipped to the bounds of the video
encoding. The contents of any region not updated with
drawable data is undefined.</p>

<p>If video is successfully initiated, an XvVideoNotify
event with detail XvStarted is generated for the drawable.
If the port is already in use, its video is preempted, and
if the new drawable is different than the old, an
XvVideoNotify event with detail XvPreempted is generated for
the old drawable. If the port is grabbed by another client,
this request is ignored, and an XvVideoNotify event with
detail XvBusy is generated for the drawable.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUES [Success] Returned if XvGetVideo(3)
completed successfully.</p>

<p>[XvBadExtension] Returned if the Xv extension is
unavailable.</p>

<p>[XvBadAlloc] Returned if XvGetVideo(3) failed to
allocate memory to process the request.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS [XvBadPort] Generated if the requested port
does not exist.</p>

<p>[BadGC] Generated if the requested graphics context does
not exist.</p>

<p>[BadDrawable] Generated if the requested drawable does
not exist.</p>

<p>[BadAlloc] Generated if there were insufficient
resources to process the request.</p>
