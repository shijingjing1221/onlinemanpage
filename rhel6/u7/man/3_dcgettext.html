<p>NAME gettext, dgettext, dcgettext - translate
message</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;libintl.h&gt;</p>

<p>char * gettext (const char * msgid); char * dgettext
(const char * domainname, const char * msgid); char *
dcgettext (const char * domainname, const char * msgid, int
category);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The gettext, dgettext and dcgettext
functions attempt to translate a text string into the users
native language, by looking up the transla- tion in a
message catalog.</p>

<p>The msgid argument identifies the message to be
translated. By conven- tion, it is the English version of
the message, with non-ASCII charac- ters replaced by ASCII
approximations. This choice allows the transla- tors to work
with message catalogs, called PO files, that contain both
the English and the translated versions of each message, and
can be installed using the msgfmt utility.</p>

<p>A message domain is a set of translatable msgid
messages. Usually, every software package has its own
message domain. The domain name is used to determine the
message catalog where the translation is looked up; it must
be a non-empty string. For the gettext function, it is
specified through a preceding textdomain call. For the
dgettext and dcgettext functions, it is passed as the
domainname argument; if this argument is NULL, the domain
name specified through a preceding textdo- main call is used
instead.</p>

<p>Translation lookup operates in the context of the
current locale. For the gettext and dgettext functions, the
LC_MESSAGES locale facet is used. It is determined by a
preceding call to the setlocale function.
setlocale(LC_ALL,&quot;&quot;) initializes the LC_MESSAGES
locale based on the first nonempty value of the three
environment variables LC_ALL, LC_MES- SAGES, LANG; see
setlocale(3). For the dcgettext function, the locale facet
is determined by the category argument, which should be one
of the LC_xxx constants defined in the &lt;locale.h&gt;
header, excluding LC_ALL. In both cases, the functions also
use the LC_CTYPE locale facet in order to convert the
translated message from the translators code- set to the
current locales codeset, unless overridden by a prior call
to the bind_textdomain_codeset function.</p>

<p>The message catalog used by the functions is at the
pathname dirname/locale/category/domainname.mo. Here dirname
is the directory specified through bindtextdomain. Its
default is system and configura- tion dependent; typically
it is prefix/share/locale, where prefix is the installation
prefix of the package. locale is the name of the cur- rent
locale facet; the GNU implementation also tries
generalizations, such as the language name without the
territory name. category is LC_MESSAGES for the gettext and
dgettext functions, or the argument passed to the dcgettext
function.</p>

<p>If the LANGUAGE environment variable is set to a
nonempty value, and the locale is not the &quot;C&quot;
locale, the value of LANGUAGE is assumed to contain a colon
separated list of locale names. The functions will attempt
to look up a translation of msgid in each of the locales in
turn. This is a GNU extension.</p>

<p>In the &quot;C&quot; locale, or if none of the used
catalogs contain a translation for msgid, the gettext,
dgettext and dcgettext functions return msgid.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE If a translation was found in one of the
specified catalogs, it is con- verted to the locale s
codeset and returned. The resulting string is statically
allocated and must not be modified or freed. Otherwise msgid
is returned.</p>

<p>ERRORS errno is not modified.</p>

<p>BUGS The return type ought to be const char *, but is
char * to avoid warn- ings in C code predating ANSI C.</p>

<p>When an empty string is used for msgid, the functions
may return a nonempty string.</p>
