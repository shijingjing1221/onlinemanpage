<p>NAME XvPutStill - write a single frame of video to a
drawable</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;X11/extensions/Xvlib.h&gt;</p>

<p>int XvPutStill(Display *dpy, XvPortID port, Drawable d,
GC gc, int vx, int vy, unsigned int vw, unsigned int vh, int
dx, int dy, unsigned int dw, unsigned int dh);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS dpy Specifies the connection to the X
server.</p>

<p>port Defines the port from which to get the still.</p>

<p>d Defines the drawable into which the still is to be
writ- ten. Pixmaps are currently not supported.</p>

<p>gc Defines the graphical context. GC components are:
sub- window-mode, clip-x-origin, clip-y-origin, and clip-
mask.</p>

<p>vx,vy,vw,vh Define the location and size of the video
region to be written. vx and vy define the upper-left pixel
of the region. vw and vh define the width and height, in
pix- els, of the region.</p>

<p>dx,dy,dw,dh Define the location and size of the
destination region into which the still image is written. dx
and dy define the upper-left corner of the region. dw and dh
define the width and height, in pixels, of the region.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION XvPutStill(3) writes a single frame of video
to a drawable. The posi- tion and size of the source (video)
rectangle is specified by vx, vy, vw, and vh. The position
and size of the destination (drawable) rect- angle is
specified by dx, dy, dw, and dh.</p>

<p>Video data is clipped to the bounds of the video
encoding, scaled to the requested drawable region size (or
the closest size supported) and clipped to the bounds of the
drawable.</p>

<p>If the port is grabbed by another client, this request
is ignored, and an XvVideoNotify event with detail XvBusy is
generated for the draw- able. If the port is not receiving a
valid video signal a VideoNotify event with detail
XvHardError is generated for the drawable.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUES [Success] Returned if XvPutStill(3)
completed successfully.</p>

<p>[XvBadExtension] Returned if the Xv extension is
unavailable.</p>

<p>[XvBadAlloc] Returned if XvGetStill(3) failed to
allocate memory to process the request.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS [XvBadPort] Generated if the requested port
does not exist.</p>

<p>[BadDrawable] Generated if the requested drawable does
not exist.</p>

<p>[BadGC] Generated if the requested graphics context does
not exist.</p>

<p>[BadAlloc] Generated if there were insufficient
resources to process the request.</p>
