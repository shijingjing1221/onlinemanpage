<p>TIFFReadRawStrip(3TIFF) TIFFReadRawStrip(3TIFF)</p>

<p>NAME TIFFReadRawStrip - return the undecoded contents of
a strip of data from an open TIFF file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tiffio.h&gt;</p>

<p>tsize_t TIFFReadRawStrip(TIFF *tif, tstrip_t strip,
tdata_t buf, tsize_t size)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Read the contents of the specified strip
into the (user supplied) data buffer. Note that the value of
strip is a raw strip number. That is, the caller must take
into account whether or not the data is orga- nized in
separate planes (PlanarConfiguration=2). To read a full
strip of data the data buffer should typically be at least
as large as the number returned by TIFFStripSize.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUES The actual number of bytes of data that
were placed in buf is returned; TIFFReadEncodedStrip returns
-1 if an error was encountered.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS All error messages are directed to the
TIFFError(3TIFF) routine.</p>
