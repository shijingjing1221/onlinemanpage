<p>NAME tagsoup - convert nasty, ugly HTML to clean
XHTML</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS java -jar tagsoup [ options ] [ files ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Rectify arbitrary HTML into clean XHTML,
using a tailored description of HTML. The output will be
well-formed XML, but not necessarily valid XHTML.</p>

<p>--files multiple input files should be processed into
corresponding out- put files</p>

<p>--encoding=encoding specifies the encoding of input
files</p>

<p>--output-encoding=encoding specifies the encoding of the
output (if the encoding name begins with utf , the output
will not contain character enti- ties; otherwise, all
non-ASCII characters are represented as entities)</p>

<p>--html output rectified HTML rather than XML, omitting
the XML declara- tion and any namespace declarations</p>

<p>--method=html output rectified HTML rather than XML
(end-tags are omitted for empty elements, and no character
escaping is done in script and style elements)</p>

<p>--omit-xml-declaration omit the XML declaration</p>

<p>--lexical output lexical features (specifically comments
and any DOCTYPE declaration)</p>

<p>--nons suppress namespaces in output</p>

<p>--nobogons suppress unknown non-HTML elements in
output</p>

<p>--nodefaults suppress default attribute values</p>

<p>--nocolons change explicit colons in element and
attribute names to under- scores</p>

<p>--norestart dont restart any restartable elements</p>

<p>--ignorable pass through ignorable whitespace
(whitespace in element-only content) via SAX method handler
ignorableWhitespace</p>

<p>--any treat unknown non-HTML elements as allowing any
content (default)</p>

<p>--emptybogons treat unknown non-HTML elements as empty
elements</p>

<p>--norootbogons dont allow unknown non-HTML elements to
be root elements</p>

<p>--doctype-system=system-id force DOCTYPE declaration to
be output with specified system identifier</p>

<p>--doctype-public=public-id force DOCTYPE declaration to
be output with specified public identifier</p>

<p>--standalone=[yes|no] specify standalone
pseudo-attribute in output XML declaration</p>

<p>--version=version specify version pseudo-attribute in
output XML declaration (does not affect actual version of
XML output)</p>

<p>--nocdata treat the CDATA-content elements script and
style as ordinary elements (mostly for testing)</p>

<p>--pyx output PYX format rather than XML (mostly for
testing)</p>

<p>--pyxin input is PYX-format HTML (mostly for
testing)</p>

<p>--reuse reuse the same Parser object internally (for
testing only)</p>

<p>--help output basic help</p>

<p>--version output version number</p>

<p>TagSoup is a parser and reformatter for nasty, ugly
HTML. Its normal processing mode is to accept HTML files on
the command line, or from the standard input if none are
given, and output them as clean XML to the standard output.
The encoding is assumed to be the platform-local encoding on
input, and is always UTF-8 on output.</p>

<p>When the --files option is given, each input file is
processed into an output file of the corresponding name,
with the extension changed to xhtml. If the extension is
already xhtml, it is changed to xhtml_.</p>

<p>TagSoup will repair, by whatever means necessary,
violations of XML well-formedness. In particular, it will
fix up malformed attribute names and supply missing
attribute-value quotation marks. More signif- icantly, it
supplies end-tags where HTML allows them to be omitted, and
sometimes where it doesnt. It will even supply start-tags
where nec- essary; for example, if a document begins with a
&lt;li&gt; tag, TagSoup will automatically prefix it with
&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;ul&gt;.</p>

<p>BUGS TagSoup can be fooled by missing close quotes after
attribute values, and by incorrect character encodings (it
does not contain an encoding guesser).</p>

<p>TagSoup doesn t understand namespace declarations, which
are not prop- erly part of HTML. Instead, any element or
attribute name beginning foo: will be put into the
artificial namespace urn:x-prefix:foo.</p>

<p>For the same reasons, namespace-qualified attributes
like xml:space can t be returned as default values, though
an explicit attribute in the xml namespace will be returned
with the proper namespace URI.</p>
