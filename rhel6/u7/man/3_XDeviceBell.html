<p>XDEVICEBELL(3) XDEVICEBELL(3)</p>

<p>NAME XDeviceBell - ring a bell on a device supported
through the input extension</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;X11/extensions/XInput.h&gt;</p>

<p>Status XDeviceBell( Display *display, XDevice *device,
XID feedbackclass, XID feedbackid, int percent); display
Specifies the connection to the X server.</p>

<p>device Specifies the device with which the bell is
associated.</p>

<p>feedbackclass Specifies the class of the feedback with
which the bell is associated.</p>

<p>feedbackid Specifies the id of the feedback with which
the bell is associated.</p>

<p>percent Specifies the volume in the range -100 to 100 at
which the bell should be rung.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The XDeviceBell request causes the server to
ring a bell on the specified feedback of the specified
device, if possible. The specified volume is relative to the
base volume for the bell. If an invalid device is specified,
a BadDevice error will be returned. The feedbackclass and
feedbackid parameters contain values returned by an
XGetFeedbackControl request and uniquely identify the bell
to ring. If a feedbackclass is specified that does not
support a bell, or if a nonexistent feedbackid is specified,
or a percent value is specified that is not in the range
-100 to 100, a BadValue error will be returned.</p>

<p>The volume at which the bell is rung when the percent
argument is nonnegative is: base - [(base * percent) / 100]
+ percent</p>

<p>The volume at which the bell rings when the percent
argument is negative is: base + [(base * percent) / 100]</p>

<p>To change the base volume of the bell, use
XChangeFeedbackControl.</p>

<p>XDeviceBell can generate a BadDevice or a BadValue
error.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS BadDevice An invalid device was specified.
The specified device does not exist, or has not been opened
by this client via XOpenInputDevice.</p>

<p>BadValue An invalid feedbackclass, feedbackid, or
percent value was specified.</p>
