<p>NAME vmsplice - splice user pages into a pipe</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #define _GNU_SOURCE #include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/uio.h&gt;</p>

<p>long vmsplice(int fd, const struct iovec *iov, unsigned
long nr_segs, unsigned int flags);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The vmsplice() system call maps nr_segs
ranges of user memory described by iov into a pipe. The file
descriptor fd must refer to a pipe.</p>

<p>The pointer iov points to an array of iovec structures
as defined in &lt;sys/uio.h&gt;:</p>

<p>struct iovec { void *iov_base; /* Starting address */
size_t iov_len; /* Number of bytes */ };</p>

<p>The flags argument is a bit mask that is composed by
ORing together zero or more of the following values:</p>

<p>SPLICE_F_MOVE Unused for vmsplice(); see splice(2).</p>

<p>SPLICE_F_NONBLOCK Do not block on I/O; see splice(2) for
further details.</p>

<p>SPLICE_F_MORE Currently has no effect for vmsplice(),
but may be implemented in the future; see splice(2).</p>

<p>SPLICE_F_GIFT The user pages are a gift to the kernel.
The appli- cation may not modify this memory ever, or page
cache and on-disk data may differ. Gifting pages to the
kernel means that a subsequent splice(2) SPLICE_F_MOVE can
successfully move the pages; if this flag is not specified,
then a subsequent splice(2) SPLICE_F_MOVE must copy the
pages. Data must also be properly page aligned, both in
memory and length.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, vmsplice()
returns the number of bytes transferred to the pipe. On
error, vmsplice() returns -1 and errno is set to indicate
the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS EBADF fd either not valid, or doesnt refer to a
pipe.</p>

<p>EINVAL nr_segs is 0 or greater than IOV_MAX; or memory
not aligned if SPLICE_F_GIFT set.</p>

<p>ENOMEM Out of memory.</p>

<p>VERSIONS The vmsplice() system call first appeared in
Linux 2.6.17.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO This system call is Linux-specific.</p>

<p>NOTES vmsplice() follows the other vectorized read/write
type functions when it comes to limitations on number of
segments being passed in. This limit is IOV_MAX as defined
in &lt;limits.h&gt;. At the time of this writ- ing, that
limit is 1024.</p>
