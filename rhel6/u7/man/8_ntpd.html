<p>DESCRIPTION The ntpd program is an operating system
daemon that synchronises the system clock with remote NTP
time servers or local reference clocks. It is a complete
implementation of the Network Time Protocol (NTP) version 4,
but also retains compatibility with version 3, as defined by
RFC-1305, and version 1 and 2, as defined by RFC-1059 and
RFC-1119, respectively. The program can operate in any of
several modes, as described on the Association Management
page, and with both symmetric key and public key
cryptography, as described on the Authentication Options
page.</p>

<p>The ntpd program ordinarily requires a configuration
file as described on the Configuration Commands and Options
collection above. However a client can discover remote
servers and configure them automatically. This makes it
possible to deploy a fleet of workstations without speci-
fying configuration details specific to the local
environment. Further details are on the Automatic Server
Discovery page.</p>

<p>Once the NTP software distribution has been compiled and
installed and the configuration file constructed, the next
step is to verify correct operation and fix any bugs that
may result. Usually, the command line that starts the daemon
is included in the system startup file, so it is executed
only at system boot time; however, the daemon can be stopped
and restarted from root at any time. Once started, the
daemon will begin sending and receiving messages, as
specified in the configuration file.</p>

<p>SETTING THE TIME AND FREQUENCY The ntpd program operates
by exchanging messages with one or more servers at
designated intervals ranging from about one minute to about
17 minutes. When started, the program requires several
exchanges while the algorithms accumulate and groom the data
before setting the clock. The initial delay to set the clock
can be reduced using options on the Server Options page.</p>

<p>Most computers today incorporate a time-of-year (TOY)
chip to maintain the time during periods when the power is
off. When the machine is booted, the chip is used to
initialize the operating system time. In case there is no
TOY chip or the TOY time is more than 1000 s from the server
time, ntpd assumes something must be terribly wrong and
exits with a panic message to the system operator. With the
-g option the clock will be initially set to the server time
regardless of the chip time. However, once the clock has
been set, an error greater than 1000 s will cause ntpd to
exit anyway.</p>

<p>Under ordinary conditions, ntpd slews the clock so that
the time is effectively continuous and never runs backwards.
If due to extreme net- work congestion an error spike
exceeds the step threshold, by default 128 ms, the spike is
discarded. However, if the error persists for more than the
stepout threshold, by default 900 s, the system clock is
stepped to the correct value. In practice the need for a
step has is extremely rare and almost always the result of a
hardware failure. With the -x option the step threshold is
increased to 600 s. Other options are available using the
tinker command on the Miscellaneous Options page.</p>

<p>The issues should be carefully considered before using
these options. The maximum slew rate possible is limited to
500 parts-per-million (PPM) by the Unix kernel. As a result,
the clock can take 2000 s for each second the clock is
outside the acceptable range. During this interval the clock
will not be consistent with any other network clock and the
system cannot be used for distributed applications that
require correctly synchronized network time.</p>

<p>The frequency file, usually called ntp.drift, contains
the latest esti- mate of clock frequency. If this file does
not exist when ntpd is started, it enters a special mode
designed to measure the particular frequency directly. The
measurement takes 15 minutes, after which the frequency is
set and ntpd resumes normal mode where the time and fre-
quency are continuously adjusted. The frequency file is
updated at intervals of an hour or more depending on the
measured clock stability.</p>

<p>OPERATING MODES The ntpd program normally operates
continuously while adjusting the time and frequency, but in
some cases it may not be practical to run it continuously.
With the -q option ntpd operates as in continous mode, but
exits just after setting the clock for the first time with
the con- figured servers. Most applications will probably
want to specify the iburst option with the server command.
With this option a volley of messages is exchanged to groom
the data and set the clock in about 10 s. If nothing is
heard after a few minutes, the daemon times out and
exits.</p>

<p>POLL INTERVAL CONTROL NTP uses an intricate heuristic
algorithm to automatically control the poll interval for
maximum accuracy consistent with minimum network overhead.
The algorithm measures the incidental offset and jitter to
determine the best poll interval. When ntpd starts, the
interval is the default minimum 64 s. Under normal
conditions when the clock discipline has stabilized, the
interval increases in steps to the default maximum 1024 s.
In addition, should a server become unreachable after some
time, the interval increases in steps to the maximum in
order to reduce network overhead.</p>

<p>The default poll interval range is suitable for most
conditions, but can be changed using options on the Server
Options and Miscellaneous Options pages. However, when using
maximum intervals much larger than the default, the residual
clock frequency error must be small enough for the
discipline loop to capture and correct. The capture range is
500 PPM with a 64-s interval decreasing by a factor of two
for each interval doubling. At a 36-hr interval, for
example, the capture range is only 0.24 PPM.</p>

<p>THE HUFF--PUFF FILTER In scenarios where a considerable
amount of data are to be downloaded or uploaded over
telephone modems, timekeeping quality can be seriously
degraded. This occurs because the differential delays on the
two direc- tions of transmission can be quite large. In many
cases the apparent time errors are so large as to exceed the
step threshold and a step correction can occur during and
after the data transfer.</p>

<p>The huff-n-puff filter is designed to correct the
apparent time offset in these cases. It depends on knowledge
of the propagation delay when no other traffic is present,
such as during other than work hours. The filter remembers
the minimum delay over the most recent interval mea- sured
usually in hours. Under conditions of severe delay, the
filter corrects the apparent offset using the sign of the
offset and the dif- ference between the apparent delay and
minimum delay. The name of the filter reflects the negative
(huff) and positive (puff) correction, which depends on the
sign of the offset. The filter is activated by the tinker
huffpuff command, as described in the Miscellaneous Options
page.</p>

<p>LEAP SECOND PROCESSING As provided by international
agreement, an extra second is sometimes inserted in
Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) at the end of a selected
month, usually June or December. The National Institutes of
Standards and Technology (NIST) provides an historic
leapseconds file at time.nist.gov for retrieval via FTP.
When this file, usually called ntp-leapseconds.list, is
copied and installed in a directory. The leap- file
configuration command specifies the path to this file. At
startup, ntpd reads it and initializes three leapsecond
values: the NTP seconds at the next leap event, the offset
of UTC relative to International Atomic Time (TAI) after the
leap and the NTP seconds when the leapsec- onds file expires
and should be retrieved again.</p>

<p>If a host does not have the leapsecond values, they can
be obtained over the net using the Autokey security
protocol. Ordinarily, the leapseconds file is installed on
the primary servers and the values flow from them via
secondary servers to the clients. When multiple servers are
involved, the values with the latest expiration time are
used.</p>

<p>If the latest leap is in the past, nothing further is
done other than to install the TAI offset. If the leap is in
the future less than 28 days, the leap warning bits are set.
If in the future less than 23 hours, the kernel is armed to
insert one second at the end of the cur- rent day. If the
kernel is enabled, the leap is done automatically at that
time; otherwise, the clock is effectively stopped for one
second at the leap. Additional details are in the The NTP
Timescale and Leap Seconds white paper</p>

<p>If none of the above provisions are available,
dsependent servers and clients tally the leap warning bits
of surviving servers and reference clocks. When a majority
of the survivors show warning, a leap is pro- grammed at the
end of the current month. During the month and day of
insertion, they operate as above. In this way the leap is
propagated at all dependent servers and clients.</p>

<p>ADDITIONAL FEATURES A new experimental feature called
interleaved modes can be used in NTP symmetric or broadcast
modes. It is designed to improve accuracy by avoiding kernel
latency and queueing delay, as described on the NTP
Interleaved Modes page. It is activated by the xleave option
with the peer or broadcast configuration commands. The NTP
protocol automati- cally reconfigures in normal or
interleaved mode as required. Ordinary broadcast clients can
use the same servers as interleaved clients at the same
time. Further details are in the white paper NTP Interleaved
On-Wire Protocol and the briefing Interleaved
Synchronization Protocols for LANs and Space Data Links.</p>

<p>If ntpd, is configured with NetInfo support, it will
attempt to read its configuration from the NetInfo service
if the default ntp.conf file cannot be read and no file is
specified by the -c option.</p>

<p>In contexts where a host name is expected, a -4
qualifier preceding the host name forces DNS resolution to
the IPv4 namespace, while a -6 qual- ifier forces DNS
resolution to the IPv6 namespace.</p>

<p>Various internal ntpd variables can be displayed and
configuration options altered while the ntpd is running
using the ntpq and ntpdc utility programs.</p>

<p>When ntpd starts it looks at the value of umask, and if
zero ntpd will set the umask to 022.</p>

<p>Unless the -n, -d or -D option is used, ntpd changes the
current work- ing directory to the root directory, so any
options or commands speci- fying paths need to use an
absolute path or a path relative to the root.</p>

<p>COMMAND LINE OPTIONS -4 Force DNS resolution of host
names to the IPv4 namespace.</p>

<p>-6 Force DNS resolution of host names to the IPv6
namespace.</p>

<p>-a Require cryptographic authentication for broadcast
client, mul- ticast client and symmetric passive
associations. This is the same operation as the enable auth
command and is the default.</p>

<p>-A Do not require cryptographic authentication for
broadcast client, multicast client and symmetric passive
associations. This is the same operation as the disable auth
command and almost never a good idea.</p>

<p>-b Enable the client to synchronize to broadcast
servers.</p>

<p>-c conffile Specify the name and path of the
configuration file, default /etc/ntp.conf.</p>

<p>-d Specify debugging mode. This option may occur more
than once, with each occurrence indicating greater detail of
display.</p>

<p>-D level Specify debugging level directly.</p>

<p>-f driftfile Specify the name and path of the frequency
file. This is the same operation as the driftfile driftfile
command.</p>

<p>-g Normally, ntpd exits with a message to the system log
if the offset exceeds the panic threshold, which is 1000 s
by default. This option allows the time to be set to any
value without restriction; however, this can happen only
once. If the thresh- old is exceeded after that, ntpd will
exit with a message to the system log. This option can be
used with the -q and -x options. See the tinker command for
other options.</p>

<p>-i jaildir Chroot the server to the directory jaildir.
This option also implies that the server attempts to drop
root privileges at startup (otherwise, chroot gives very
little additional secu- rity), and it is only available if
the OS supports to run the server without full root
privileges. You may need to also spec- ify a -u option.</p>

<p>-I [address | interface name] Open the network address
given, or all the addresses associated with the given
interface name. This option may appear multiple times. This
option also implies not opening other addresses, except
wildcard and localhost. This option is deprecated. Please
consider using the configuration file interface command,
which is more versatile.</p>

<p>-k keyfile Specify the name and path of the symmetric
key file. This is the same operation as the keys keyfile
command.</p>

<p>-l logfile Specify the name and path of the log file.
The default is the system log file. This is the same
operation as the logfile log- file command.</p>

<p>-L Do not listen to virtual interfaces, defined as those
with names containing a colon. This option is deprecated.
Please consider using the configuration file interface
command, which is more versatile.</p>

<p>-M Raise scheduler precision to its maximum (1 msec)
using timeBe- ginPeriod. (Windows only)</p>

<p>-m Lock memory.</p>

<p>-n Dont fork.</p>

<p>-N To the extent permitted by the operating system, run
the ntpd at the highest priority.</p>

<p>-p pidfile Specify the name and path of the file used to
record the ntpd process ID. This is the same operation as
the pidfile pidfile command.</p>

<p>-P priority To the extent permitted by the operating
system, run the ntpd at the specified priority.</p>

<p>-q Exit the ntpd just after the first time the clock is
set. This behavior mimics that of the ntpdate program, which
is to be retired. The -g and -x options can be used with
this option. Note: The kernel time discipline is disabled
with this option.</p>

<p>-r broadcastdelay Specify the default propagation delay
from the broadcast/multi- cast server to this client. This
is necessary only if the delay cannot be computed
automatically by the protocol.</p>

<p>-s statsdir Specify the directory path for files created
by the statistics facility. This is the same operation as
the statsdir statsdir command.</p>

<p>-t key Add a key number to the trusted key list. This
option can occur more than once. This is the same operation
as the trustedkey key command.</p>

<p>-u user[:group] Specify a user, and optionally a group,
to switch to. This option is only available if the OS
supports running the server without full root privileges.
Currently, this option is sup- ported under NetBSD
(configure with --enable-clockctl) and Linux (configure with
--enable-linuxcaps).</p>

<p>-U interface update interval Number of seconds to wait
between interface list scans to pick up new and delete
network interface. Set to 0 to disable dynamic interface
list updating. The default is to scan every 5 minutes.</p>

<p>-x Normally, the time is slewed if the offset is less
than the step threshold, which is 128 ms by default, and
stepped if above the threshold. This option sets the
threshold to 600 s, which is well within the accuracy window
to set the clock manu- ally. Note: Since the slew rate of
typical Unix kernels is lim- ited to 0.5 ms/s, each second
of adjustment requires an amorti- zation interval of 2000 s.
Thus, an adjustment as much as 600 s will take almost 14
days to complete. This option can be used with the -g and -q
options. See the tinker command for other options. Note: The
kernel time discipline is disabled with this option and the
step threshold is applied also to leap second
corrections.</p>

<p>THE CONFIGURATION FILE Ordinarily, ntpd reads the
ntp.conf configuration file at startup in order to determine
the synchronization sources and operating modes. It is also
possible to specify a working, although limited,
configuration entirely on the command line, obviating the
need for a configuration file. This may be particularly
useful when the local host is to be con- figured as a
broadcast client, with servers determined by listening to
broadcasts at run time.</p>

<p>Usually, the configuration file is installed
as/etc/ntp.conf, but could be installed elsewhere (see the
-c conffile command line option). The file format is similar
to other Unix configuration files - comments begin with a #
character and extend to the end of the line; blank lines are
ignored.</p>

<p>Configuration commands consist of an initial command
keyword followed by a list of option keywords separated by
whitespace. Commands may not be continued over multiple
lines. Options may be host names, host addresses written in
numeric, dotted-quad form, integers, floating point numbers
(when specifying times in seconds) and text strings.
Optional arguments are delimited by [ ] in the options
pages, while alternatives are separated by |. The notation [
... ] means an optional, indefinite repetition of the last
item before the [ ... ].</p>
