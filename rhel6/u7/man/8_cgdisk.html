<p>CGDISK(8) GPT fdisk Manual CGDISK(8)</p>

<p>NAME cgdisk - Curses-based GUID partition table (GPT)
manipulator</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS cgdisk [ -a ] device</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION GPT fdisk is a text-mode family of programs
for creation and manipula- tion of partition tables. The
cgdisk member of this family employs a curses-based user
interface for interaction using a text-mode menuing system.
It will automatically convert an old-style Master Boot
Record (MBR) partition table or BSD disklabel stored without
an MBR carrier partition to the newer Globally Unique
Identifier (GUID) Partition Ta- ble (GPT) format, or will
load a GUID partition table. Other members of this program
family are gdisk (the most feature-rich program of the
group, with a non-curses-based interactive user interface)
and sgdisk (which is driven via command-line options for use
by experts or in scripts). FixParts is a related program for
fixing a limited set of problems with MBR disks.</p>

<p>For information on MBR vs. GPT, as well as GPT
terminology and struc- ture, see the extended GPT fdisk
documentation at http://www.rods- books.com/gdisk/ or
consult Wikipedia.</p>

<p>The cgdisk program employs a user interface similar to
that of Linuxs cfdisk, but cgdisk modifies GPT partitions.
It also has the capability of transforming MBR partitions or
BSD disklabels into GPT partitions. Like the original cfdisk
program, cgdisk does not modify disk struc- tures until you
explicitly write them to disk, so if you make a mis- take,
you can exit from the program with the Quit option to leave
your partitions unmodified.</p>

<p>Ordinarily, cgdisk operates on disk device files, such
as /dev/sda or /dev/hda under Linux, /dev/disk0 under Mac OS
X, or /dev/ad0 or /dev/da0 under FreeBSD. The program can
also operate on disk image files, which can be either copies
of whole disks (made with dd, for instance) or raw disk
images used by emulators such as QEMU or VMWare. Note that
only raw disk images are supported; cgdisk cannot work on
compressed or other advanced disk image formats.</p>

<p>Upon start, cgdisk attempts to identify the partition
type in use on the disk. If it finds valid GPT data, cgdisk
will use it. If cgdisk finds a valid MBR or BSD disklabel
but no GPT data, it will attempt to convert the MBR or
disklabel into GPT form. (BSD disklabels are likely to have
unusable first and/or final partitions because they overlap
with the GPT data structures, though.) Upon exiting with the
w option, cgdisk replaces the MBR or disklabel with a GPT.
This action is potentially dangerous! Your system may become
unbootable, and partition type codes may become corrupted if
the disk uses unrecognized type codes. Boot problems are
particularly likely if youre multi-booting with any
GPT-unaware OS. If you mistakenly launch cgdisk on an MBR
disk, you can safely exit the program without making any
changes by using the Quit option.</p>

<p>When creating a fresh partition table, certain
considerations may be in order:</p>

<p>* For data (non-boot) disks, and for boot disks used on
BIOS-based computers with GRUB as the boot loader,
partitions may be cre- ated in whatever order and in
whatever sizes are desired.</p>

<p>* Boot disks for EFI-based systems require an EFI System
Partition (GPT fdisk internal code 0xEF00) formatted as
FAT-32. The rec- ommended size of this partition is between
100 and 300 MiB. Boot-related files are stored here. (Note
that GNU Parted iden- tifies such partitions as having the
&quot;boot flag&quot; set.)</p>

<p>* The GRUB 2 boot loader for BIOS-based systems makes
use of a BIOS Boot Partition (GPT fdisk internal code
0xEF02), in which the secondary boot loader is stored,
without the benefit of a filesystem. This partition can
typically be quite small (roughly 32 KiB to 1 MiB), but you
should consult your boot loader docu- mentation for
details.</p>

<p>* If Windows is to boot from a GPT disk, a partition of
type Microsoft Reserved (GPT fdisk internal code 0x0C01) is
recom- mended. This partition should be about 128 MiB in
size. It ordi- narily follows the EFI System Partition and
immediately precedes the Windows data partitions. (Note that
old versions of GNU Parted create all FAT partitions as this
type, which actually makes the partition unusable for normal
file storage in both Windows and Mac OS X.)</p>

<p>* Some OSes GPT utilities create some blank space
(typically 128 MiB) after each partition. The intent is to
enable future disk utilities to use this space. Such free
space is not required of GPT disks, but creating it may help
in future disk maintenance. You can use GPT fdisk s relative
partition positioning option (specifying the starting sector
as +128M , for instance) to simplify creating such gaps.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Only one command-line option is accepted, aside
from the device file- name: -a. This option alters the
highlighting of partitions and blocks of free space: Instead
of using ncurses, when -a is used cgdisk uses a
&quot;&gt;&quot; symbol to the left of the selected
partition or free space. This option is intended for use on
limited display devices such as teletypes and screen
readers.</p>

<p>Interactions with cgdisk occur with its interactive
text-mode menus. The display is broken into two interactive
parts:</p>

<p>* The partition display area, in which partitions and
gaps between them (marked as &quot;free space&quot;) are
summarized.</p>

<p>* The option selection area, in which buttons for the
main options appear.</p>

<p>In addition, the top of the display shows the programs
name and ver- sion number, the device filename associated
with the disk, and the disks size in both sectors and
IEEE-1541 units (GiB, TiB, and so on).</p>

<p>You can use the following keys to move among the various
options and to select among them:</p>

<p>up arrow This key moves the partition selection up by
one partition.</p>

<p>down arrow This key moves the partition selection down
by one partition.</p>

<p>Page Up This key moves the partition selection up by one
screen.</p>

<p>Page Down This key moves the partition selection down by
one screen.</p>

<p>right arrow This key moves the option selection to the
right by one item.</p>

<p>left arrow This key moves the option selection to the
left by one item.</p>

<p>Enter This key activates the currently selected option.
You can also activate an option by typing the capitalized
letter in the option s name on the keyboard, such as a to
activate the Align option.</p>

<p>If more partitions exist than can be displayed in one
screen, you can scroll between screens using the partition
selection keys, much as in a text editor.</p>

<p>Available options are as described below. (Note that
cgdisk provides a much more limited set of options than its
sibling gdisk. If you need to perform partition table
recovery, hybrid MBR modifcation, or other advanced
operations, you should consult the gdisk documentation.)</p>

<p>Align Change the sector alignment value. Disks with more
logical sec- tors than physical sectors (such as modern
Advanced Format drives), some RAID configurations, and many
SSD devices, can suffer performance problems if partitions
are not aligned prop- erly for their internal data
structures. On new disks, GPT fdisk attempts to align
partitions on 2048-sector (1MiB) boundaries by default,
which optimizes performance for all of these disk types. On
pre-partitioned disks, GPT fdisk attempts to identify the
alignment value used on that disk, but will set 8-sector
alignment on disks larger than 300 GB even if lesser
alignment values are detected. In either case, it can be
changed by using this option.</p>

<p>Backup Save partition data to a backup file. You can
back up your cur- rent in-memory partition table to a disk
file using this option. The resulting file is a binary file
consisting of the protective MBR, the main GPT header, the
backup GPT header, and one copy of the partition table, in
that order. Note that the backup is of the current in-memory
data structures, so if you launch the pro- gram, make
changes, and then use this option, the backup will reflect
your changes.</p>

<p>Delete Delete a partition. This action deletes the entry
from the par- tition table but does not disturb the data
within the sectors originally allocated to the partition on
the disk. If a corre- sponding hybrid MBR partition exists,
gdisk deletes it, as well, and expands any adjacent 0xEE
(EFI GPT) MBR protective partition to fill the new free
space.</p>

<p>Help Print brief descriptions of all the options.</p>

<p>Info Show detailed partition information. The summary
information shown in the partition display area necessarily
omits many details, such as the partitions unique GUIDs and
the parti- tions sector-exact start and end points. The Info
option dis- plays this information for a single
partition.</p>

<p>Load Load partition data from a backup file. This option
is the reverse of the Backup option. Note that restoring
partition data from anything but the original disk is not
recommended.</p>

<p>naMe Change the GPT name of a partition. This name is
encoded as a UTF-16 string, but proper entry and display of
anything beyond basic ASCII values requires suitable locale
and font support. For the most part, Linux ignores the
partition name, but it may be important in some OSes. GPT
fdisk sets a default name based on the partition type code.
Note that the GPT partition name is different from the
filesystem name, which is encoded in the filesystem s data
structures. Note also that to activate this item by typing
its alphabetic equivalent, you must use M, not the more
obvious N, because the latter is used by the next
option....</p>

<p>New Create a new partition. You enter a starting sector,
a size, a type code, and a name. The start sector can be
specified in absolute terms as a sector number or as a
position measured in kibibytes (K), mebibytes (M), gibibytes
(G), tebibytes (T), or pebibytes (P); for instance, 40M
specifies a position 40MiB from the start of the disk. You
can specify locations relative to the start or end of the
specified default range by preceding the number by a +
symbol, as in +2G to specify a point 2GiB after the default
start sector. The size value can use the K, M, G, T, and P
suffixes, too. Pressing the Enter key with no input speci-
fies the default value, which is the start of the largest
avail- able block for the start sector and the full
available size for the size.</p>

<p>Quit Quit from the program without saving your changes.
Use this option if you just wanted to view information or if
you make a mistake and want to back out of all your
changes.</p>

<p>Type Change a single partitions type code. You enter the
type code using a two-byte hexadecimal number. You may also
enter a GUID directly, if you have one and cgdisk doesn t
know it. If you don t know the type code for your partition,
you can type L to see a list of known type codes.</p>

<p>Verify Verify disk. This option checks for a variety of
problems, such as incorrect CRCs and mismatched main and
backup data. This option does not automatically correct most
problems, though; for that, you must use gdisk. If no
problems are found, this command displays a summary of
unallocated disk space.</p>

<p>Write Write data. Use this command to save your
changes.</p>

<p>BUGS As of March 2014 (version 0.8.10), cgdisk should be
considered beta software. Although the underlying partition
manipulation code is much older, the cgdisk ncurses user
interface is brand new with GPT fdisk version 0.8.0. Known
bugs and limitations include:</p>

<p>* The program compiles correctly only on Linux, FreeBSD,
and Mac OS X. In theory, it should compile under Windows if
the Ncurses library for Windows is installed, but I have not
tested this capability. Linux versions for x86-64 (64-bit),
x86 (32-bit), and PowerPC (32-bit) have been tested, with
the x86-64 version having seen the most testing. Under
FreeBSD, 32-bit (x86) and 64-bit (x86-64) versions have been
tested. Only 32-bit versions for Mac OS X has been tested by
the author.</p>

<p>* The FreeBSD version of the program cant write changes
to the partition table to a disk when existing partitions on
that disk are mounted. (The same problem exists with many
other FreeBSD utilities, such as gpt, fdisk, and dd.) This
limitation can be overcome by typing sysctl
kern.geom.debugflags=16 at a shell prompt.</p>

<p>* The program can load only up to 128 partitions (4
primary parti- tions and 124 logical partitions) when
converting from MBR for- mat. This limit can be raised by
changing the #define MAX_MBR_PARTS line in the basicmbr.h
source code file and recom- piling; however, such a change
will require using a larger-than-normal partition table.
(The limit of 128 partitions was chosen because that number
equals the 128 partitions sup- ported by the most common
partition table size.)</p>

<p>* Converting from MBR format sometimes fails because of
insuffi- cient space at the start or (more commonly) the end
of the disk. Resizing the partition table (using the s
option in the experts menu in gdisk) can sometimes overcome
this problem; however, in extreme cases it may be necessary
to resize a parti- tion using GNU Parted or a similar tool
prior to conversion with GPT fdisk.</p>

<p>* MBR conversions work only if the disk has correct LBA
partition descriptors. These descriptors should be present
on any disk over 8 GiB in size or on smaller disks
partitioned with any but very ancient software.</p>

<p>* BSD disklabel support can create first and/or last
partitions that overlap with the GPT data structures. This
can sometimes be compensated by adjusting the partition
table size, but in extreme cases the affected partition(s)
may need to be deleted.</p>

<p>* Because of the highly variable nature of BSD disklabel
struc- tures, conversions from this form may be unreliable
-- parti- tions may be dropped, converted in a way that
creates overlaps with other partitions, or converted with
incorrect start or end values. Use this feature with
caution!</p>

<p>* Booting after converting an MBR or BSD disklabel disk
is likely to be disrupted. Sometimes re-installing a boot
loader will fix the problem, but other times you may need to
switch boot load- ers. Except on EFI-based platforms,
Windows through at least Windows 7 doesn t support booting
from GPT disks. Creating a hybrid MBR (using the h option on
the recovery &amp; transforma- tion menu in gdisk) or
abandoning GPT in favor of MBR may be your only options in
this case.</p>

<p>* The cgdisk Verify function and the partition type
listing obtainable by typing L in the Type function (or when
specifying a partition type while creating a new partition)
both currently exit ncurses mode. This limitation is a minor
cosmetic blemish that does not affect functionality.</p>
