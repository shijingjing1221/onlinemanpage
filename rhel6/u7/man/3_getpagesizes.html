<p>NAME getpagesizes - Get the system supported huge page
sizes</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;hugetlbfs.h&gt;</p>

<p>int getpagesizes(long pagesizes[], int n_elem);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The getpagesizes() function returns either
the number of system sup- ported page sizes or the sizes
themselves. If pagesizes is NULL and n_elem is 0, then the
number of pages the system supports is returned. Otherwise,
pagesizes is filled with at most n_elem page sizes.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, either the number of page sizes
supported by the system or the number of page sizes stored
in pagesizes is returned. On failure, -1 is returned and
errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS EINVAL n_elem is less than zero or n_elem is
greater than zero and pagesizes is NULL.</p>

<p>Also see opendir(3) for other possible values for errno.
This error occurs when the sysfs directory exists but cannot
be opened.</p>

<p>NOTES This call will return all page sizes as reported
by the kernel. Not all of these sizes may be usable by the
programmer since mount points may not be available for the
huge page sizes. To test whether a size will be usable by
libhugetlbfs, hugetlbfs_find_path_for_size() can be called
on a specific size to see if a mount point is
configured.</p>

the libhugetlbfs-devel mailing list.</p>
