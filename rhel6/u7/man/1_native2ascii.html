<p>Name native2ascii - Native-to-ASCII Converter</p>

<p>Converts a file with characters in any supported
character encoding to one with ASCII and/or Unicode escapes,
or visa versa.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS native2ascii [options] [inputfile
[outputfile]]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION native2ascii converts files that are encoded
to any character encoding that is supported by the Java
runtime environment to files encoded in ASCII, using Unicode
escapes (&quot;xxxx&quot; notation) for all characters that
are not part of the ASCII character set. This process is
required for properties files containing characters not in
ISO-8859-1 character sets. The tool can also perform the
reverse conversion.</p>

<p>If outputfile is omitted, standard output is used for
output. If, in addition, inputfile is omitted, standard
input is used for input.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -reverse Perform the reverse operation: Convert
a file encoded in ISO-8859-1 with Unicode escapes to a file
in any character encod- ing supported by the Java runtime
environment.</p>

<p>-encoding encoding_name Specifies the name of the
character encoding to be used by the conversion procedure.
If this option is not present, the default character
encoding (as determined by the
java.nio.charset.Charset.defaultCharset method) is used. The
encoding_name string must be the name of a character
encoding that is supported by the Java runtime environment -
see the Sup- ported Encodings @
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/intl/encod-
ing.doc.html document.</p>

<p>-Joption Pass option to the Java virtual machine, where
option is one of the options described on the reference page
for the java(1). For example, -J-Xms48m sets the startup
memory to 48 megabytes.</p>
