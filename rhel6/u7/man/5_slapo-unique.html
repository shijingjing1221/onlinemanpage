<p>NAME slapo-unique - Attribute Uniqueness overlay to
slapd</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS /etc/openldap/slapd.conf</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The Attribute Uniqueness overlay can be used
with a backend database such as slapd-bdb(5) to enforce the
uniqueness of some or all attributes within a scope. This
subtree defaults to all objects within the subtree of the
database for which the Uniqueness overlay is config-
ured.</p>

<p>Uniqueness is enforced by searching the subtree to
ensure that the val- ues of all attributes presented with an
add, modify or modrdn operation are unique within the scope.
For example, if uniqueness were enforced for the uid
attribute, the subtree would be searched for any other
records which also have a uid attribute containing the same
value. If any are found, the request is rejected.</p>

<p>The search is performed using the rootdn of the
database, to avoid issues with ACLs preventing the overlay
from seeing all of the relevant data. As such, the database
must have a rootdn configured.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION These slapd.conf options apply to the
Attribute Uniqueness overlay. They should appear after the
overlay directive.</p>

<p>unique_uri &lt;[strict ][ignore ]URI[URI...]...&gt;
Configure the base, attributes, scope, and filter for
uniqueness checking. Multiple URIs may be specified within a
domain, allowing complex selections of objects. Multiple
unique_uri statements or olcUniqueURI attributes will create
independent domains, each with their own independent lists
of URIs and ignore/strict settings.</p>

<p>Keywords strict and ignore have to be enclosed in quotes
(&quot;) together with the URI.</p>

<p>The LDAP URI syntax is a subset of RFC-4516, and takes
the form:</p>

<p>ldap:///[base dn]?[attributes...]?scope[?filter]</p>

<p>The base dn defaults to that of the back-end database.
Speci- fied base dns must be within the subtree of the
back-end database.</p>

<p>If no attributes are specified, the URI applies to all
non-oper- ational attributes.</p>

<p>The scope component is effectively mandatory, because
LDAP URIs default to base scope, which is not valid for
uniqueness, because groups of one object are always unique.
Scopes of sub (for subtree) and one for one-level are
valid.</p>

<p>The filter component causes the domain to apply
uniqueness con- straints only to matching objects. e.g.
ldap:///?cn?sub?(sn=e*) would require unique cn attributes
for all objects in the subtree of the back-end database
whose sn starts with an e.</p>

<p>It is possible to assert uniqueness upon all
non-operational attributes except those listed by prepending
the keyword ignore If not configured, all non-operational
(e.g., system) attributes must be unique. Note that the
attributes list of an ignore URI should generally contain
the objectClass, dc, ou and o attributes, as these will
generally not be unique, nor are they operational
attributes.</p>

<p>It is possible to set strict checking for the uniqueness
domain by prepending the keyword strict. By default,
uniqueness is not enforced for null values. Enabling strict
mode extends the con- cept of uniqueness to include null
values, such that only one attribute within a subtree will
be allowed to have a null value. Strictness applies to all
URIs within a uniqueness domain, but some domains may be
strict while others are not.</p>

<p>It is not possible to set both URIs and legacy
slapo-unique configura- tion parameters simultaneously. In
general, the legacy configuration options control pieces of
a single unfiltered subtree domain.</p>

<p>unique_base &lt;basedn&gt; This legacy configuration
parameter should be converted to the base dn component of
the above unique_uri style of parameter.</p>

<p>unique_ignore &lt;attribute...&gt; This legacy
configuration parameter should be converted to a unique_uri
parameter with ignore keyword as described above.</p>

<p>unique_attributes &lt;attribute...&gt; This legacy
configuration parameter should be converted to a unique_uri
parameter, as described above.</p>

<p>unique_strict &lt;attribute...&gt; This legacy
configuration parameter should be converted to a strict
keyword prepended to a unique_uri parameter, as described
above.</p>

<p>CAVEATS unique_uri cannot be used with the old-style of
configuration, and vice versa. unique_uri can implement
everything the older system can do, however.</p>

<p>Typical attributes for the ignore ldap:///... URIs are
intentionally not hardcoded into the overlay to allow for
maximum flexibility in meeting site-specific
requirements.</p>

<p>Replication and operations with manageDsaIt control are
allowed to bypass this enforcement. It is therefore
important that all servers accepting writes have this
overlay configured in order to maintain uniqueness in a
replicated DIT.</p>
