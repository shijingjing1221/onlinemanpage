<p>ZSHBUILTINS(1) ZSHBUILTINS(1)</p>

<p>NAME zshbuiltins - zsh built-in commands</p>

<p>SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS - simple command See the section
Precommand Modifiers.</p>

<p>. file [ arg ... ] Read commands from file and execute
them in the current shell environment.</p>

<p>If file does not contain a slash, or if PATH_DIRS is
set, the shell looks in the components of $path to find the
directory containing file. Files in the current directory
are not read unless . appears somewhere in $path. If a file
named file.zwc is found, is newer than file, and is the
compiled form (created with the zcompile builtin) of file,
then commands are read from that file instead of file.</p>

<p>If any arguments arg are given, they become the
positional parameters; the old positional parameters are
restored when the file is done executing. If file was not
found the return status is 127; if file was found but
contained a syntax error the return status is 126; else the
return status is the exit status of the last command
executed.</p>

<p>: [ arg ... ] This command does nothing, although normal
argument expansions is performed which may have effects on
shell parameters. A zero exit status is returned.</p>

<p>alias [ {+|-}gmrsL ] [ name[=value] ... ] For each name
with a corresponding value, define an alias with that value.
A trailing space in value causes the next word to be checked
for alias expansion. If the -g flag is present, define a
global alias; global aliases are expanded even if they do
not occur in command position.</p>

<p>If the -s flags is present, define a suffix alias: if
the com- mand word on a command line is in the form
text.name, where text is any non-empty string, it is
replaced by the text value text.name . Note that name is
treated as a literal string, not a pattern. A trailing space
in value is not special in this case. For example,</p>

<p>alias -s ps=gv</p>

<p>will cause the command *.ps to be expanded to gv *.ps.
As alias expansion is carried out earlier than globbing, the
*.ps will then be expanded. Suffix aliases constitute a
different name space from other aliases (so in the above
example it is still possible to create an alias for the
command ps) and the two sets are never listed together.</p>

<p>For each name with no value, print the value of name, if
any. With no arguments, print all currently defined aliases
other than suffix aliases. If the -m flag is given the
arguments are taken as patterns (they should be quoted to
preserve them from being interpreted as glob patterns), and
the aliases matching these patterns are printed. When
printing aliases and one of the -g, -r or -s flags is
present, restrict the printing to global, regular or suffix
aliases, respectively; a regular alias is one which is
neither a global nor a suffix alias. Using + instead of -,
or ending the option list with a single +, prevents the
values of the aliases from being printed.</p>

<p>If the -L flag is present, then print each alias in a
manner suitable for putting in a startup script. The exit
status is nonzero if a name (with no value) is given for
which no alias has been defined.</p>

<p>For more on aliases, include common problems, see the
section ALIASING in zshmisc(1).</p>

<p>autoload [ {+|-}UXktz ] [ -w ] [ name ... ] Equivalent
to functions -u, with the exception of -X/+X and -w.</p>

<p>The flag -X may be used only inside a shell function,
and may not be followed by a name. It causes the calling
function to be marked for autoloading and then immediately
loaded and executed, with the current array of positional
parameters as arguments. This replaces the previous
definition of the function. If no function definition is
found, an error is printed and the func- tion remains
undefined and marked for autoloading.</p>

<p>The flag +X attempts to load each name as an autoloaded
func- tion, but does not execute it. The exit status is zero
(suc- cess) if the function was not previously defined and a
defini- tion for it was found. This does not replace any
existing defi- nition of the function. The exit status is
nonzero (failure) if the function was already defined or
when no definition was found. In the latter case the
function remains undefined and marked for autoloading. If
ksh-style autoloading is enabled, the function created will
contain the contents of the file plus a call to the function
itself appended to it, thus giving normal ksh autoloading
behaviour on the first call to the function.</p>

<p>With the -w flag, the names are taken as names of files
compiled with the zcompile builtin, and all functions
defined in them are marked for autoloading.</p>

<p>The flags -z and -k mark the function to be autoloaded
in native or ksh emulation, as if the option KSH_AUTOLOAD
were unset or were set, respectively. The flags override the
setting of the option at the time the function is
loaded.</p>

<p>bg [ job ... ] job ... &amp; Put each specified job in
the background, or the current job if none is specified.</p>

<p>bindkey See the section Zle Builtins in zshzle(1).</p>

<p>break [ n ] Exit from an enclosing for, while, until,
select or repeat loop. If n is specified, then break n
levels instead of just one.</p>

<p>builtin name [ args ... ] Executes the builtin name,
with the given args.</p>

<p>bye Same as exit.</p>

<p>cap See the section The zsh/cap Module in
zshmodules(1).</p>

<p>cd [ -qsLP ] [ arg ] cd [ -qsLP ] old new cd [ -qsLP ]
{+|-}n Change the current directory. In the first form,
change the current directory to arg, or to the value of
$HOME if arg is not specified. If arg is -, change to the
previous directory.</p>

<p>Otherwise, if arg begins with a slash, attempt to change
to the directory given by arg.</p>

<p>If arg does not begin with a slash, the behaviour
depends on whether the current directory . occurs in the
list of directo- ries contained in the shell parameter
cdpath. If it does not, first attempt to change to the
directory arg under the current directory, and if that fails
but cdpath is set and contains at least one element attempt
to change to the directory arg under each component of
cdpath in turn until successful. If . occurs in cdpath, then
cdpath is searched strictly in order so that . is only tried
at the appropriate point.</p>

<p>The order of testing cdpath is modified if the option
POSIX_CD is set, as described in the documentation for the
option.</p>

<p>If no directory is found, the option CDABLE_VARS is set,
and a parameter named arg exists whose value begins with a
slash, treat its value as the directory. In that case, the
parameter is added to the named directory hash table.</p>

<p>The second form of cd substitutes the string new for the
string old in the name of the current directory, and tries
to change to this new directory.</p>

<p>The third form of cd extracts an entry from the
directory stack, and changes to that directory. An argument
of the form +n identifies a stack entry by counting from the
left of the list shown by the dirs command, starting with
zero. An argument of the form -n counts from the right. If
the PUSHD_MINUS option is set, the meanings of + and - in
this context are swapped.</p>

<p>If the -q (quiet) option is specified, the hook function
chpwd and the functions in the array chpwd_functions are not
called. This is useful for calls to cd that do not change
the environ- ment seen by an interactive user.</p>

<p>If the -s option is specified, cd refuses to change the
current directory if the given pathname contains symlinks.
If the -P option is given or the CHASE_LINKS option is set,
symbolic links are resolved to their true values. If the -L
option is given symbolic links are retained in the directory
(and not resolved) regardless of the state of the
CHASE_LINKS option.</p>

<p>chdir Same as cd.</p>

<p>clone See the section The zsh/clone Module in
zshmodules(1).</p>

<p>command [ -pvV ] simple command The simple command
argument is taken as an external command instead of a
function or builtin and is executed. If the POSIX_BUILTINS
option is set, builtins will also be executed but certain
special properties of them are suppressed. The -p flag
causes a default path to be searched instead of that in
$path. With the -v flag, command is similar to whence and
with -V, it is equivalent to whence -v.</p>

<p>See also the section Precommand Modifiers.</p>

zshmodules(1).</p>

<p>comptry See the section The zsh/computil Module in

<p>compvalues See the section The zsh/computil Module in
zshmodules(1).</p>

<p>continue [ n ] Resume the next iteration of the
enclosing for, while, until, select or repeat loop. If n is
specified, break out of n-1 loops and resume at the nth
enclosing loop.</p>

<p>declare Same as typeset.</p>

<p>dirs [ -c ] [ arg ... ] dirs [ -lpv ] With no arguments,
print the contents of the directory stack. Directories are
added to this stack with the pushd command, and removed with
the cd or popd commands. If arguments are speci- fied, load
them onto the directory stack, replacing anything that was
there, and push the current directory onto the stack.</p>

<p>-c clear the directory stack.</p>

<p>-l print directory names in full instead of using of
using ~ expressions.</p>

<p>-p print directory entries one per line.</p>

<p>-v number the directories in the stack when
printing.</p>

<p>disable [ -afmrs ] name ... Temporarily disable the
named hash table elements. The default is to disable builtin
commands. This allows you to use an external command with
the same name as a builtin command. The -a option causes
disable to act on regular or global aliases. The -s option
causes disable to act on suffix aliases. The -f option
causes disable to act on shell functions. The -r options
causes disable to act on reserved words. Without arguments
all disabled hash table elements from the corresponding hash
table are printed. With the -m flag the arguments are taken
as pat- terns (which should be quoted to prevent them from
undergoing filename expansion), and all hash table elements
from the corre- sponding hash table matching these patterns
are disabled. Dis- abled objects can be enabled with the
enable command.</p>

<p>disown [ job ... ] job ... &amp;| job ... &amp;! Remove
the specified jobs from the job table; the shell will no
longer report their status, and will not complain if you try
to exit an interactive shell with them running or stopped.
If no job is specified, disown the current job.</p>

<p>If the jobs are currently stopped and the AUTO_CONTINUE
option is not set, a warning is printed containing
information about how to make them running after they have
been disowned. If one of the latter two forms is used, the
jobs will automatically be made running, independent of the
setting of the AUTO_CONTINUE option.</p>

<p>echo [ -neE ] [ arg ... ] Write each arg on the standard
output, with a space separating each one. If the -n flag is
not present, print a newline at the end. echo recognizes the
following escape sequences:</p>

<p>a bell character b b a c k s p a c e e escape f form
feed n linefeed (newline)r carriage return t horizontal tab
vertical tab \ backslash 0NNN character code in octal NN
character code in hexadecimal uNNNN unicode character code
in hexadecimal UNNNNNNNN unicode character code in
hexadecimal</p>

<p>The -E flag, or the BSD_ECHO option, can be used to
disable these escape sequences. In the latter case, -e flag
can be used to enable them.</p>

<p>echotc See the section The zsh/termcap Module in
zshmodules(1).</p>

<p>echoti See the section The zsh/terminfo Module in
zshmodules(1).</p>

<p>emulate [ -LR ] [ {zsh|sh|ksh|csh} [ -c arg ] ] Without
any argument print current emulation mode.</p>

<p>With single argument set up zsh options to emulate the
specified shell as much as possible. csh will never be fully
emulated. If the argument is not one of the shells listed
above, zsh will be used as a default; more precisely, the
tests performed on the argument are the same as those used
to determine the emulation at startup based on the shell
name, see the section Compatibil- ity in zshmisc(1) .</p>

<p>If the -R option is given, all options are reset to
their default value corresponding to the specified emulation
mode, except for certain options describing the interactive
environ- ment; otherwise, only those options likely to cause
portability problems in scripts and functions are altered.
If the -L option is given, the options LOCAL_OPTIONS and
LOCAL_TRAPS will be set as well, causing the effects of the
emulate command and any setopt and trap commands to be local
to the immediately sur- rounding shell function, if any;
normally these options are turned off in all emulation modes
except ksh. The -L and -c are mutually exclusive.</p>

<p>If -c arg is given, evaluate arg while the requested
emulation is temporarily in effect. The emulation and all
options will be restored to their original values before
emulate returns. The -R flag may be used.</p>

<p>Use of -c enables sticky emulation mode for functions
defined within the evaluated expression: the emulation mode
is associ- ated thereafter with the function so that
whenever the function is executed the emulation (respecting
the -R flag, if present) and all options are set before
entry to the function, and restored after exit. If the
function is called when the sticky emulation is already in
effect, either within an emulate shell -c expression or
within another function with the same sticky emulation,
entry and exit from the function do not cause options to be
altered (except due to standard processing such as the
LOCAL_OPTIONS option).</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>emulate sh -cfni() { setopt cshnullglob; } fno() { fni;
} fno</p>

<p>The two functions fni and fno are defined with sticky sh
emula- tion. fno is then executed, causing options
associated with emulations to be set to their values in sh.
fni then calls fno; because fno is also marked for sticky sh
emulation, no option changes take place on entry to or exit
from it. Hence the option cshnullglob, turned off by sh
emulation, will be turned on within fni and remain on on
return to fno. On exit from fno, the emulation mode and all
options will be restored to the state they were in before
entry to the temporary emulation.</p>

<p>The documentation above is typically sufficient for the
intended purpose of executing code designed for other shells
in a suit- able environment. More detailed rules follow. 1.
The sticky emulation environment provided by emulate shell
-c is identical to that provided by entry to a function
marked for sticky emulation as a consequence of being
defined in such an environment. Hence, for exam- ple, the
sticky emulation is inherited by subfunctions defined within
functions with sticky emulation. 2. No change of options
takes place on entry to or exit from functions that are not
marked for sticky emulation, other than those that would
normally take place, even if those functions are called
within sticky emulation. 3. No special handling is provided
for functions marked for autoload nor for functions present
in wordcode created by the zcompile command. 4. The presence
or absence of the -R flag to emulate corre- sponds to
different sticky emulation modes, so for exam- ple emulate
sh -c, emulate -R sh -c and emulate csh -c are treated as
three distinct sticky emulations.</p>

<p>enable [ -afmrs ] name ... Enable the named hash table
elements, presumably disabled ear- lier with disable. The
default is to enable builtin commands. The -a option causes
enable to act on regular or global aliases. The -s option
causes enable to act on suffix aliases. The -f option causes
enable to act on shell functions. The -r option causes
enable to act on reserved words. Without arguments all
enabled hash table elements from the corresponding hash
table are printed. With the -m flag the arguments are taken
as pat- terns (should be quoted) and all hash table elements
from the corresponding hash table matching these patterns
are enabled. Enabled objects can be disabled with the
disable builtin com- mand.</p>

<p>eval [ arg ... ] Read the arguments as input to the
shell and execute the result- ing command(s) in the current
shell process. The return status is the same as if the
commands had been executed directly by the shell; if there
are no args or they contain no commands (i.e. are an empty
string or whitespace) the return status is zero.</p>

<p>exec [ -cl ] [ -a argv0 ] simple command Replace the
current shell with an external command rather than forking.
With -c clear the environment; with -l prepend - to the
argv[0] string of the command executed (to simulate a login
shell); with -a argv0 set the argv[0] string of the command
exe- cuted. See the section Precommand Modifiers.</p>

<p>exit [ n ] Exit the shell with the exit status specified
by n; if none is specified, use the exit status from the
last command executed. An EOF condition will also cause the
shell to exit, unless the IGNORE_EOF option is set.</p>

<p>export [ name[=value] ... ] The specified names are
marked for automatic export to the envi- ronment of
subsequently executed commands. Equivalent to type- set -gx.
If a parameter specified does not already exist, it is
created in the global scope.</p>

<p>false [ arg ... ] Do nothing and return an exit status
of 1.</p>

<p>fc [ -e ename ] [ -m match ] [ old=new ... ] [ first [
last ] ] fc -l [ -nrdfEiD ] [ -t timefmt ] [ -m match ] [
old=new ... ] [ first [ last ] ] fc -p [ -a ] [ filename [
histsize [ savehistsize ] ] ] fc -P fc -ARWI [ filename ]
Select a range of commands from first to last from the
history list. The arguments first and last may be specified
as a number or as a string. A negative number is used as an
offset to the current history event number. A string
specifies the most recent event beginning with the given
string. All substitutions old=new, if any, are then
performed on the commands.</p>

<p>If the -l flag is given, the resulting commands are
listed on standard output. If the -m flag is also given the
first argu- ment is taken as a pattern (should be quoted)
and only the his- tory events matching this pattern will be
shown. Otherwise the editor program ename is invoked on a
file containing these his- tory events. If ename is not
given, the value of the parameter FCEDIT is used; if that is
not set the value of the parameter EDITOR is used; if that
is not set a builtin default, usually vi is used. If ename
is -, no editor is invoked. When editing is complete, the
edited command is executed.</p>

<p>If first is not specified, it will be set to -1 (the
most recent event), or to -16 if the -l flag is given. If
last is not spec- ified, it will be set to first, or to -1
if the -l flag is given.</p>

<p>The flag -r reverses the order of the commands and the
flag -n suppresses command numbers when listing.</p>

<p>Also when listing, -d prints timestamps for each command
-f prints full time-date stamps in the US MM/DD/YY hh:mm
format -E prints full time-date stamps in the European
dd.mm.yyyy hh:mm format -i prints full time-date stamps in
ISO8601 yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm format -t fmt prints time and date
stamps in the given format; fmt is formatted with the
strftime function with the zsh exten- sions described for
the %D{string} prompt format in the section EXPANSION OF
PROMPT SEQUENCES in zshmisc(1). The resulting formatted
string must be no more than 256 char- acters or will not be
printed. -D prints elapsed times; may be combined with one
of the options above.</p>

<p>fc -p pushes the current history list onto a stack and
switches to a new history list. If the -a option is also
speci- fied, this history list will be automatically popped
when the current function scope is exited, which is a much
better solution than creating a trap function to call fc -P
manually. If no arguments are specified, the history list is
left empty, $HISTFILE is unset, and $HISTSIZE &amp;
$SAVEHIST are set to their default values. If one argument
is given, $HISTFILE is set to that filename, $HISTSIZE &amp;
$SAVEHIST are left unchanged, and the history file is read
in (if it exists) to initialize the new list. If a second
argument is specified, $HISTSIZE &amp; $SAVEHIST are instead
set to the single specified numeric value. Finally, if a
third argument is specified, $SAVEHIST is set to a separate
value from $HISTSIZE. You are free to change these
environment values for the new history list however you
desire in order to manipulate the new history list.</p>

<p>fc -P pops the history list back to an older list saved
by fc -p. The current list is saved to its $HISTFILE before
it is destroyed (assuming that $HISTFILE and $SAVEHIST are
set appro- priately, of course). The values of $HISTFILE,
$HISTSIZE, and $SAVEHIST are restored to the values they had
when fc -p was called. Note that this restoration can
conflict with making these variables &quot;local&quot;, so
your best bet is to avoid local dec- larations for these
variables in functions that use fc -p. The one other
guaranteed-safe combination is declaring these variables to
be local at the top of your function and using the automatic
option (-a) with fc -p. Finally, note that it is legal to
manually pop a push marked for automatic popping if you need
to do so before the function exits.</p>

<p>fc -R reads the history from the given file, fc -W
writes the history out to the given file, and fc -A appends
the his- tory out to the given file. If no filename is
specified, the $HISTFILE is assumed. If the -I option is
added to -R, only those events that are not already
contained within the internal history list are added. If the
-I option is added to -A or -W, only those events that are
new since last incremental append/write to the history file
are appended/written. In any case, the created file will
have no more than $SAVEHIST entries.</p>

<p>fg [ job ... ] job ... Bring each specified job in turn
to the foreground. If no job is specified, resume the
current job.</p>

<p>float [ {+|-}EFHghlprtux ] [ -LRZ [ n ]] [ name[=value]
... ] Equivalent to typeset -E, except that options
irrelevant to floating point numbers are not permitted.</p>

<p>functions [ {+|-}UXkmtuz ] [ name ... ] functions -M
mathfn [ min [ max [ shellfn ] ] ] functions -M [ -m pattern
... ] functions +M [ -m ] mathfn Equivalent to typeset -f,
with the exception of the -M option. Use of the -M option
may not be combined with any of the options handled by
typeset -f.</p>

<p>functions -M mathfn defines mathfn as the name of a
mathematical function recognised in all forms of
arithmetical expressions; see the section Arithmetic
Evaluation in zshmisc(1). By default mathfn may take any
number of comma-separated arguments. If min is given, it
must have exactly min args; if min and max are both given,
it must have at least min and and at most max args. max may
be -1 to indicate that there is no upper limit.</p>

<p>By default the function is implemented by a shell
function of the same name; if shellfn is specified it gives
the name of the corresponding shell function while mathfn
remains the name used in arithmetical expressions. The name
of the function in $0 is mathfn (not shellfn as would
usually be the case), provided the option FUNCTION_ARGZERO
is in effect. The positional parameters in the shell
function correspond to the arguments of the mathe- matical
function call. The result of the last arithmetical
expression evaluated inside the shell function (even if it
is a form that normally only returns a status) gives the
result of the mathematical function.</p>

<p>functions -M with no arguments lists all such
user-defined func- tions in the same form as a definition.
With the additional option -m and a list of arguments, all
functions whose mathfn matches one of the pattern arguments
are listed.</p>

<p>function +M removes the list of mathematical functions;
with the additional option -m the arguments are treated as
patterns and all functions whose mathfn matches the pattern
are removed. Note that the shell function implementing the
behaviour is not removed (regardless of whether its name
coincides with mathfn).</p>

<p>For example, the following prints the cube of 3:</p>

<p>zmath_cube() { (( $1 * $1 * $1 )) } functions -M cube 1
1 zmath_cube print $(( cube(3) ))</p>

<p>getcap See the section The zsh/cap Module in
zshmodules(1).</p>

<p>getln [ -AclneE ] name ... Read the top value from the
buffer stack and put it in the shell parameter name.
Equivalent to read -zr.</p>

<p>getopts optstring name [ arg ... ] Checks the args for
legal options. If the args are omitted, use the positional
parameters. A valid option argument begins with a + or a -.
An argument not beginning with a + or a -, or the argument
--, ends the options. Note that a single - is not considered
a valid option argument. optstring contains the letters that
getopts recognizes. If a letter is followed by a : , that
option requires an argument. The options can be separated
from the argument by blanks.</p>

<p>Each time it is invoked, getopts places the option
letter it finds in the shell parameter name, prepended with
a + when arg begins with a +. The index of the next arg is
stored in OPTIND. The option argument, if any, is stored in
OPTARG.</p>

<p>The first option to be examined may be changed by
explicitly assigning to OPTIND. OPTIND has an initial value
of 1, and is normally reset to 1 upon exit from a shell
function. OPTARG is not reset and retains its value from the
most recent call to getopts. If either of OPTIND or OPTARG
is explicitly unset, it remains unset, and the index or
option argument is not stored. The option itself is still
stored in name in this case.</p>

<p>A leading : in optstring causes getopts to store the
letter of any invalid option in OPTARG, and to set name to ?
for an unknown option and to : when a required argument is
missing. Otherwise, getopts sets name to ? and prints an
error message when an option is invalid. The exit status is
nonzero when there are no more options.</p>

<p>hash [ -Ldfmrv ] [ name[=value] ] ... hash can be used
to directly modify the contents of the command hash table,
and the named directory hash table. Normally one would
modify these tables by modifying ones PATH (for the com-
mand hash table) or by creating appropriate shell parameters
(for the named directory hash table). The choice of hash
table to work on is determined by the -d option; without the
option the command hash table is used, and with the option
the named directory hash table is used.</p>

<p>Given no arguments, and neither the -r or -f options,
the selected hash table will be listed in full.</p>

<p>The -r option causes the selected hash table to be
emptied. It will be subsequently rebuilt in the normal
fashion. The -f option causes the selected hash table to be
fully rebuilt imme- diately. For the command hash table this
hashes all the abso- lute directories in the PATH, and for
the named directory hash table this adds all users home
directories. These two options cannot be used with any
arguments.</p>

<p>The -m option causes the arguments to be taken as
patterns (which should be quoted) and the elements of the
hash table matching those patterns are printed. This is the
only way to display a limited selection of hash table
elements.</p>

<p>For each name with a corresponding value, put name in
the selected hash table, associating it with the pathname
value. In the command hash table, this means that whenever
name is used as a command argument, the shell will try to
execute the file given by value. In the named directory hash
table, this means that value may be referred to as
~name.</p>

<p>For each name with no corresponding value, attempt to
add name to the hash table, checking what the appropriate
value is in the normal manner for that hash table. If an
appropriate value can t be found, then the hash table will
be unchanged.</p>

<p>The -v option causes hash table entries to be listed as
they are added by explicit specification. If has no effect
if used with -f.</p>

<p>If the -L flag is present, then each hash table entry is
printed in the form of a call to hash.</p>

<p>history Same as fc -l.</p>

<p>integer [ {+|-}Hghilprtux ] [ -LRZ [ n ]] [ name[=value]
... ] Equivalent to typeset -i, except that options
irrelevant to integers are not permitted.</p>

<p>jobs [ -dlprs ] [ job ... ] jobs -Z string Lists
information about each given job, or all jobs if job is
omitted. The -l flag lists process IDs, and the -p flag
lists process groups. If the -r flag is specified only
running jobs will be listed and if the -s flag is given only
stopped jobs are shown. If the -d flag is given, the
directory from which the job was started (which may not be
the current directory of the job) will also be shown.</p>

<p>The -Z option replaces the shells argument and
environment space with the given string, truncated if
necessary to fit. This will normally be visible in ps
(ps(1)) listings. This fea- ture is typically used by
daemons, to indicate their state.</p>

<p>kill [ -s signal_name | -n signal_number | -sig ] job
... kill -l [ sig ... ] Sends either SIGTERM or the
specified signal to the given jobs or processes. Signals are
given by number or by names, with or without the SIG prefix.
If the signal being sent is not KILL or CONT , then the job
will be sent a CONT signal if it is stopped. The argument
job can be the process ID of a job not in the job list. In
the second form, kill -l, if sig is not specified the signal
names are listed. Otherwise, for each sig that is a name,
the corresponding signal number is listed. For each sig that
is a signal number or a number representing the exit status
of a process which was terminated or stopped by a signal the
name of the signal is printed.</p>

<p>On some systems, alternative signal names are allowed
for a few signals. Typical examples are SIGCHLD and SIGCLD
or SIGPOLL and SIGIO, assuming they correspond to the same
signal number. kill -l will only list the preferred form,
however kill -l alt will show if the alternative form
corresponds to a signal number. For example, under Linux
kill -l IO and kill -l POLL both output 29, hence kill -IO
and kill -POLL have the same effect.</p>

<p>Many systems will allow process IDs to be negative to
kill a process group or zero to kill the current process
group.</p>

<p>let arg ... Evaluate each arg as an arithmetic
expression. See the section Arithmetic Evaluation in
zshmisc(1) for a description of arithmetic expressions. The
exit status is 0 if the value of the last expression is
nonzero, 1 if it is zero, and 2 if an error occurred.</p>

<p>limit [ -hs ] [ resource [ limit ] ] ... Set or display
resource limits. Unless the -s flag is given, the limit
applies only the children of the shell. If -s is given
without other arguments, the resource limits of the cur-
rent shell is set to the previously set resource limits of
the children.</p>

<p>If limit is not specified, print the current limit
placed on resource, otherwise set the limit to the specified
value. If the -h flag is given, use hard limits instead of
soft limits. If no resource is given, print all limits.</p>

<p>When looping over multiple resources, the shell will
abort imme- diately if it detects a badly formed argument.
However, if it fails to set a limit for some other reason it
will continue try- ing to set the remaining limits.</p>

<p>resource can be one of:</p>

<p>addressspace Maximum amount of address space used.
aiomemorylocked Maximum amount of memory locked in RAM for
AIO opera- tions. aiooperations Maximum number of AIO
operations. cachedthreads Maximum number of cached threads.
coredumpsize Maximum size of a core dump. cputime Maximum
CPU seconds per process. datasize Maximum data size
(including stack) for each process. descriptors Maximum
value for a file descriptor. filesize Largest single file
allowed. maxproc Maximum number of processes. maxpthreads
Maximum number of threads per process. memorylocked Maximum
amount of memory locked in RAM. memoryuse Maximum resident
set size. msgqueue Maximum number of bytes in POSIX message
queues. resident Maximum resident set size. sigpending
Maximum number of pending signals. sockbufsize Maximum size
of all socket buffers. stacksize Maximum stack size for each
process. vmemorysize Maximum amount of virtual memory.</p>

<p>Which of these resource limits are available depends on
the sys- tem. resource can be abbreviated to any unambiguous
prefix. It can also be an integer, which corresponds to the
integer defined for the resource by the operating
system.</p>

<p>If argument corresponds to a number which is out of the
range of the resources configured into the shell, the shell
will try to read or write the limit anyway, and will report
an error if this fails. As the shell does not store such
resources internally, an attempt to set the limit will fail
unless the -s option is present.</p>

<p>limit is a number, with an optional scaling factor, as
follows:</p>

<p>nh hours nk kilobytes (default) nm megabytes or minutes
[mm:]ss minutes and seconds</p>

<p>The limit command is not made available by default when
the shell starts in a mode emulating another shell. It can
be made available with the command zmodload -F zsh/rlimits
b:limit.</p>

<p>local [ {+|-}AEFHUahlprtux ] [ -LRZi [ n ]] [
name[=value] ] ... Same as typeset, except that the options
-g, and -f are not per- mitted. In this case the -x option
does not force the use of -g, i.e. exported variables will
be local to functions.</p>

<p>log List all users currently logged in who are affected
by the cur- rent setting of the watch parameter.</p>

<p>logout [ n ] Same as exit, except that it only works in
a login shell.</p>

<p>noglob simple command See the section Precommand
Modifiers.</p>

<p>popd [ [-q] {+|-}n ] Remove an entry from the directory
stack, and perform a cd to the new top directory. With no
argument, the current top entry is removed. An argument of
the form +n identifies a stack entry by counting from the
left of the list shown by the dirs command, starting with
zero. An argument of the form -n counts from the right. If
the PUSHD_MINUS option is set, the meanings of + and - in
this context are swapped.</p>

<p>If the -q (quiet) option is specified, the hook function
chpwd and the functions in the array $chpwd_functions are
not called, and the new directory stack is not printed. This
is useful for calls to popd that do not change the
environment seen by an interactive user.</p>

<p>print [ -abcDilmnNoOpPrsz ] [ -u n ] [ -f format ] [ -C
cols ] [ -R [ -en ]] [ arg ... ] With the -f option the
arguments are printed as described by printf. With no flags
or with the flag - , the arguments are printed on the
standard output as described by echo, with the following
differences: the escape sequence M-x metafies the character
x (sets the highest bit),-x produces a control character -@
and -? give the characters NUL and delete), anE is a synonym
fore. Finally, if not in an escape sequence, escapes the
following character and is not printed.</p>

<p>-a Print arguments with the column incrementing first.
Only useful with the -c and -C options.</p>

<p>-b Recognize all the escape sequences defined for the
bind- key command, see zshzle(1).</p>

<p>-c Print the arguments in columns. Unless -a is also
given, arguments are printed with the row incrementing
first.</p>

<p>-C cols Print the arguments in cols columns. Unless -a
is also given, arguments are printed with the row
incrementing first.</p>

<p>-D Treat the arguments as directory names, replacing
pre- fixes with ~ expressions, as appropriate.</p>

<p>-i If given together with -o or -O, sorting is performed
case-independently.</p>

<p>-l Print the arguments separated by newlines instead of
spaces.</p>

<p>-m Take the first argument as a pattern (should be
quoted), and remove it from the argument list together with
subse- quent arguments that do not match this pattern.</p>

<p>-n Do not add a newline to the output.</p>

<p>-N Print the arguments separated and terminated by
nulls.</p>

<p>-o Print the arguments sorted in ascending order.</p>

<p>-O Print the arguments sorted in descending order.</p>

<p>-p Print the arguments to the input of the
coprocess.</p>

<p>-P Perform prompt expansion (see EXPANSION OF PROMPT
SEQUENCES in zshmisc(1)).</p>

<p>-r Ignore the escape conventions of echo.</p>

<p>-R Emulate the BSD echo command, which does not process
escape sequences unless the -e flag is given. The -n flag
suppresses the trailing newline. Only the -e and -n flags
are recognized after -R; all other arguments and options are
printed.</p>

<p>-s Place the results in the history list instead of on
the standard output.</p>

<p>-u n Print the arguments to file descriptor n.</p>

<p>-z Push the arguments onto the editing buffer stack,
sepa- rated by spaces.</p>

<p>If any of -m, -o or -O are used in combination with -f
and there are no arguments (after the removal process in the
case of -m) then nothing is printed.</p>

<p>printf format [ arg ... ] Print the arguments according
to the format specification. For- matting rules are the same
as used in C. The same escape sequences as for echo are
recognised in the format. All C con- version specifications
ending in one of csdiouxXeEfgGn are han- dled. In addition
to this, %b can be used instead of %s to cause escape
sequences in the argument to be recognised and %q can be
used to quote the argument in such a way that allows it to
be reused as shell input. With the numeric format
specifiers, if the corresponding argument starts with a
quote character, the numeric value of the following
character is used as the number to print otherwise the
argument is evaluated as an arithmetic expression. See the
section Arithmetic Evaluation in zsh- misc(1) for a
description of arithmetic expressions. With %n, the
corresponding argument is taken as an identifier which is
created as an integer parameter.</p>

<p>Normally, conversion specifications are applied to each
argument in order but they can explicitly specify the nth
argument is to be used by replacing % by %n$ and * by *n$.
It is rec- ommended that you do not mix references of this
explicit style with the normal style and the handling of
such mixed styles may be subject to future change.</p>

<p>If arguments remain unused after formatting, the format
string is reused until all arguments have been consumed.
With the print builtin, this can be suppressed by using the
-r option. If more arguments are required by the format than
have been specified, the behaviour is as if zero or an empty
string had been specified as the argument.</p>

<p>pushd [ -qsLP ] [ arg ] pushd [ -qsLP ] old new pushd [
-qsLP ] {+|-}n Change the current directory, and push the
old current directory onto the directory stack. In the first
form, change the current directory to arg. If arg is not
specified, change to the second directory on the stack (that
is, exchange the top two entries), or change to $HOME if the
PUSHD_TO_HOME option is set or if there is only one entry on
the stack. Otherwise, arg is inter- preted as it would be by
cd. The meaning of old and new in the second form is also
the same as for cd.</p>

<p>The third form of pushd changes directory by rotating
the direc- tory list. An argument of the form +n identifies
a stack entry by counting from the left of the list shown by
the dirs command, starting with zero. An argument of the
form -n counts from the right. If the PUSHD_MINUS option is
set, the meanings of + and - in this context are
swapped.</p>

<p>If the -q (quiet) option is specified, the hook function
chpwd and the functions in the array $chpwd_functions are
not called, and the new directory stack is not printed. This
is useful for calls to pushd that do not change the
environment seen by an interactive user.</p>

<p>If the option -q is not specified and the shell option
PUSHD_SILENT is not set, the directory stack will be printed
after a pushd is performed.</p>

<p>The options -s, -L and -P have the same meanings as for
the cd builtin.</p>

<p>pushln [ arg ... ] Equivalent to print -nz.</p>

<p>pwd [ -rLP ] Print the absolute pathname of the current
working directory. If the -r or the -P flag is specified, or
the CHASE_LINKS option is set and the -L flag is not given,
the printed path will not contain symbolic links.</p>

<p>r Same as fc -e -.</p>

<p>read [ -rszpqAclneE ] [ -t [ num ] ] [ -k [ num ] ] [ -d
delim ] [ -u n ] [ name[?prompt] ] [ name ... ] Read one
line and break it into fields using the characters in $IFS
as separators, except as noted below. The first field is
assigned to the first name, the second field to the second
name, etc., with leftover fields assigned to the last name.
If name is omitted then REPLY is used for scalars and reply
for arrays.</p>

<p>-r Raw mode: a at the end of a line does not signify
line continuation and backslashes in the line dont quote the
following character and are not removed.</p>

<p>-s Don t echo back characters if reading from the
terminal. Currently does not work with the -q option.</p>

<p>-q Read only one character from the terminal and set
name to y if this character was y or Y and to n other- wise.
With this flag set the return status is zero only if the
character was y or Y . This option may be used with a
timeout; if the read times out, or encounters end of file,
status 2 is returned. Input is read from the terminal unless
one of -u or -p is present. This option may also be used
within zle widgets.</p>

<p>-k [ num ] Read only one (or num) characters. All are
assigned to the first name, without word splitting. This
flag is ignored when -q is present. Input is read from the
ter- minal unless one of -u or -p is present. This option
may also be used within zle widgets.</p>

<p>Note that despite the mnemonic key this option does read
full characters, which may consist of multiple bytes if the
option MULTIBYTE is set.</p>

<p>-z Read one entry from the editor buffer stack and
assign it to the first name, without word splitting. Text is
pushed onto the stack with print -z or with push-line from
the line editor (see zshzle(1)). This flag is ignored when
the -k or -q flags are present.</p>

<p>-e -E The input read is printed (echoed) to the standard
out- put. If the -e flag is used, no input is assigned to
the parameters.</p>

<p>-A The first name is taken as the name of an array and
all words are assigned to it.</p>

<p>-c -l These flags are allowed only if called inside a
function used for completion (specified with the -K flag to
com- pctl). If the -c flag is given, the words of the
current command are read. If the -l flag is given, the whole
line is assigned as a scalar. If both flags are present, -l
is used and -c is ignored.</p>

<p>-n Together with -c, the number of the word the cursor
is on is read. With -l, the index of the character the
cursor is on is read. Note that the command name is word
number 1, not word 0, and that when the cursor is at the end
of the line, its character index is the length of the line
plus one.</p>

<p>-u n Input is read from file descriptor n.</p>

<p>-p Input is read from the coprocess.</p>

<p>-d delim Input is terminated by the first character of
delim instead of by newline.</p>

<p>-t [ num ] Test if input is available before attempting
to read. If num is present, it must begin with a digit and
will be evaluated to give a number of seconds, which may be
a floating point number; in this case the read times out if
input is not available within this time. If num is not
present, it is taken to be zero, so that read returns
immediately if no input is available. If no input is
available, return status 1 and do not set any variables.</p>

<p>This option is not available when reading from the
editor buffer with -z, when called from within completion
with -c or -l, with -q which clears the input queue before
reading, or within zle where other mechanisms should be used
to test for input.</p>

<p>Note that read does not attempt to alter the input pro-
cessing mode. The default mode is canonical input, in which
an entire line is read at a time, so usually read -t will
not read anything until an entire line has been typed.
However, when reading from the terminal with -k input is
processed one key at a time; in this case, only availability
of the first character is tested, so that e.g. read -t -k 2
can still block on the second charac- ter. Use two instances
of read -t -k if this is not what is wanted.</p>

<p>If the first argument contains a ?, the remainder of
this word is used as a prompt on standard error when the
shell is interac- tive.</p>

<p>The value (exit status) of read is 1 when an end-of-file
is encountered, or when -c or -l is present and the command
is not called from a compctl function, or as described for
-q. Other- wise the value is 0.</p>

<p>The behavior of some combinations of the -k, -p, -q, -u
and -z flags is undefined. Presently -q cancels all the
others, -p cancels -u, -k cancels -z, and otherwise -z
cancels both -p and -u.</p>

<p>The -c or -l flags cancel any and all of -kpquz.</p>

<p>readonly Same as typeset -r.</p>

<p>rehash Same as hash -r.</p>

<p>return [ n ] Causes a shell function or . script to
return to the invoking script with the return status
specified by n. If n is omitted, the return status is that
of the last command executed.</p>

<p>If return was executed from a trap in a TRAPNAL
function, the effect is different for zero and non-zero
return status. With zero status (or after an implicit return
at the end of the trap), the shell will return to whatever
it was previously pro- cessing; with a non-zero status, the
shell will behave as inter- rupted except that the return
status of the trap is retained. Note that the numeric value
of the signal which caused the trap is passed as the first
argument, so the statement return $((128+$1)) will return
the same status as if the signal had not been trapped.</p>

<p>sched See the section The zsh/sched Module in
zshmodules(1).</p>

<p>set [ {+|-}options | {+|-}o [ option_name ] ] ... [
{+|-}A [ name ] ] [ arg ... ] Set the options for the shell
and/or set the positional parame- ters, or declare and set
an array. If the -s option is given, it causes the specified
arguments to be sorted before assigning them to the
positional parameters (or to the array name if -A is used).
With +s sort arguments in descending order. For the meaning
of the other flags, see zshoptions(1). Flags may be
specified by name using the -o option. If no option name is
sup- plied with -o, the current option states are printed:
see the description of setopt below for more information on
the format. With +o they are printed in a form that can be
used as input to the shell.</p>

<p>If the -A flag is specified, name is set to an array
containing the given args; if no name is specified, all
arrays are printed together with their values.</p>

<p>If +A is used and name is an array, the given arguments
will replace the initial elements of that array; if no name
is speci- fied, all arrays are printed without their
values.</p>

<p>The behaviour of arguments after -A name or +A name
depends on whether the option KSH_ARRAYS is set. If it is
not set, all arguments following name are treated as values
for the array, regardless of their form. If the option is
set, normal option processing continues at that point; only
regular arguments are treated as values for the array. This
means that</p>

<p>set -A array -x -- foo</p>

<p>sets array to -x -- foo if KSH_ARRAYS is not set, but
sets the array to foo and turns on the option -x if it is
set.</p>

<p>If the -A flag is not present, but there are arguments
beyond the options, the positional parameters are set. If
the option list (if any) is terminated by --, and there are
no further arguments, the positional parameters will be
unset.</p>

<p>If no arguments and no -- are given, then the names and
values of all parameters are printed on the standard output.
If the only argument is +, the names of all parameters are
printed.</p>

<p>For historical reasons, set - is treated as set +xv and
set - args as set +xv -- args when in any other emulation
mode than zshs native mode.</p>

<p>The sched builtin is not made available by default when
the shell starts in a mode emulating another shell. It can
be made available with the command zmodload -F zsh/sched
b:sched.</p>

<p>setcap See the section The zsh/cap Module in
zshmodules(1).</p>

<p>setopt [ {+|-}options | {+|-}o option_name ] [ name ...
] Set the options for the shell. All options specified
either with flags or by name are set.</p>

<p>If no arguments are supplied, the names of all options
currently set are printed. The form is chosen so as to
minimize the dif- ferences from the default options for the
current emulation (the default emulation being native zsh,
shown as &lt;Z&gt; in zshop- tions(1)). Options that are on
by default for the emulation are shown with the prefix no
only if they are off, while other options are shown without
the prefix no and only if they are on. In addition to
options changed from the default state by the user, any
options activated automatically by the shell (for example,
SHIN_STDIN or INTERACTIVE) will be shown in the list. The
format is further modified by the option KSH_OPTION_PRINT,
however the rationale for choosing options with or without
the no prefix remains the same in this case.</p>

<p>If the -m flag is given the arguments are taken as
patterns (which should be quoted to protect them from
filename expan- sion), and all options with names matching
these patterns are set.</p>

<p>shift [ n ] [ name ... ] The positional parameters
${n+1} ... are renamed to $1 ..., where n is an arithmetic
expression that defaults to 1. If any names are given then
the arrays with these names are shifted instead of the
positional parameters.</p>

<p>source file [ arg ... ] Same as ., except that the
current directory is always searched and is always searched
first, before directories in $path.</p>

<p>stat See the section The zsh/stat Module in
zshmodules(1).</p>

<p>suspend [ -f ] Suspend the execution of the shell (send
it a SIGTSTP) until it receives a SIGCONT. Unless the -f
option is given, this will refuse to suspend a login
shell.</p>

<p>test [ arg ... ] [ [ arg ... ] ] Like the system version
of test. Added for compatibility; use conditional
expressions instead (see the section Conditional Expressions
). The main differences between the conditional expression
syntax and the test and [ builtins are: these com- mands are
not handled syntactically, so for example an empty variable
expansion may cause an argument to be omitted; syntax errors
cause status 2 to be returned instead of a shell error; and
arithmetic operators expect integer arguments rather than
arithmetic expressions.</p>

<p>The command attempts to implement POSIX and its
extensions where these are specified. Unfortunately there
are intrinsic ambigui- ties in the syntax; in particular
there is no distinction between test operators and strings
that resemble them. The standard attempts to resolve these
for small numbers of argu- ments (up to four); for five or
more arguments compatibility cannot be relied on. Users are
urged wherever possible to use the [[ test syntax which does
not have these ambiguities.</p>

<p>times Print the accumulated user and system times for
the shell and for processes run from the shell.</p>

<p>trap [ arg ] [ sig ... ] arg is a series of commands
(usually quoted to protect it from immediate evaluation by
the shell) to be read and executed when the shell receives
any of the signals specified by one or more sig args. Each
sig can be given as a number, or as the name of a signal
either with or without the string SIG in front (e.g. 1, HUP,
and SIGHUP are all the same signal).</p>

<p>If arg is -, then the specified signals are reset to
their defaults, or, if no sig args are present, all traps
are reset.</p>

<p>If arg is an empty string, then the specified signals
are ignored by the shell (and by the commands it
invokes).</p>

<p>If arg is omitted but one or more sig args are provided
(i.e. the first argument is a valid signal number or name),
the effect is the same as if arg had been specified as
-.</p>

<p>The trap command with no arguments prints a list of
commands associated with each signal.</p>

<p>If sig is ZERR then arg will be executed after each
command with a nonzero exit status. ERR is an alias for ZERR
on systems that have no SIGERR signal (this is the usual
case).</p>

<p>If sig is DEBUG then arg will be executed before each
command if the option DEBUG_BEFORE_CMD is set (as it is by
default), else after each command. Here, a command is what
is described as a sublist in the shell grammar, see the
section SIMPLE COMMANDS &amp; PIPELINES in zshmisc(1). If
DEBUG_BEFORE_CMD is set various additional features are
available. First, it is possible to skip the next command by
setting the option ERR_EXIT; see the description of the
ERR_EXIT option in zshoptions(1). Also, the shell parameter
ZSH_DEBUG_CMD is set to the string corresponding to the
command to be executed following the trap. Note that this
string is reconstructed from the internal format and may not
be formatted the same way as the original text. The parame-
ter is unset after the trap is executed.</p>

<p>If sig is 0 or EXIT and the trap statement is executed
inside the body of a function, then the command arg is
executed after the function completes. The value of $? at
the start of execu- tion is the exit status of the shell or
the return status of the function exiting. If sig is 0 or
EXIT and the trap statement is not executed inside the body
of a function, then the command arg is executed when the
shell terminates; the trap runs before any zshexit hook
functions.</p>

<p>ZERR, DEBUG, and EXIT traps are not executed inside
other traps. ZERR and DEBUG traps are kept within subshells,
while other traps are reset.</p>

<p>Note that traps defined with the trap builtin are
slightly dif- ferent from those defined as TRAPNAL () { ...
}, as the latter have their own function environment (line
numbers, local vari- ables, etc.) while the former use the
environment of the command in which they were called. For
example,</p>

<p>trapprint $LINENODEBUG</p>

<p>will print the line number of a command executed after
it has run, while</p>

<p>TRAPDEBUG() { print $LINENO; }</p>

<p>will always print the number zero.</p>

<p>Alternative signal names are allowed as described under
kill above. Defining a trap under either name causes any
trap under an alternative name to be removed. However, it is
recommended that for consistency users stick exclusively to
one name or another.</p>

<p>true [ arg ... ] Do nothing and return an exit status of
0.</p>

<p>ttyctl -fu The -f option freezes the tty, and -u
unfreezes it. When the tty is frozen, no changes made to the
tty settings by external programs will be honored by the
shell, except for changes in the size of the screen; the
shell will simply reset the settings to their previous
values as soon as each command exits or is sus- pended.
Thus, stty and similar programs have no effect when the tty
is frozen. Without options it reports whether the terminal
is frozen or not.</p>

<p>type [ -wfpams ] name ... Equivalent to whence -v.</p>

<p>typeset [ {+|-}AEFHUafghklprtuxmz ] [ -LRZi [ n ]] [
name[=value] ... ] typeset -T [ {+|-}Urux ] [ -LRZ [ n ]]
SCALAR[=value] array [ sep ] Set or display attributes and
values for shell parameters.</p>

<p>A parameter is created for each name that does not
already refer to one. When inside a function, a new
parameter is created for every name (even those that already
exist), and is unset again when the function completes. See
Local Parameters in zsh- param(1). The same rules apply to
special shell parameters, which retain their special
attributes when made local.</p>

<p>For each name=value assignment, the parameter name is
set to value. Note that arrays currently cannot be assigned
in typeset expressions, only scalars and integers. Unless
the option KSH_TYPESET is set, normal expansion rules apply
to assignment arguments, so value may be split into separate
words; if the option is set, assignments which can be
recognised when expan- sion is performed are treated as
single words. For example the command typeset vbl=$(echo one
two) is treated as having one argument if KSH_TYPESET is
set, but otherwise is treated as hav- ing the two arguments
vbl=one and two.</p>

<p>If the shell option TYPESET_SILENT is not set, for each
remain- ing name that refers to a parameter that is set, the
name and value of the parameter are printed in the form of
an assignment. Nothing is printed for newly-created
parameters, or when any attribute flags listed below are
given along with the name. Using + instead of minus to
introduce an attribute turns it off.</p>

<p>If the -p option is given, parameters and values are
printed in the form of a typeset command and an assignment
(which will be printed separately for arrays and associative
arrays), regard- less of other flags and options. Note that
the -h flag on parameters is respected; no value will be
shown for these param- eters.</p>

<p>If the -T option is given, two or three arguments must
be present (an exception is that zero arguments are allowed
to show the list of parameters created in this fashion). The
first two are the name of a scalar and an array parameter
(in that order) that will be tied together in the manner of
$PATH and $path. The optional third argument is a
single-character separator which will be used to join the
elements of the array to form the scalar; if absent, a colon
is used, as with $PATH. Only the first character of the
separator is significant; any remaining characters are
ignored. Only the scalar parameter may be assigned an
initial value. Both the scalar and the array may otherwise
be manipulated as normal. If one is unset, the other will
automatically be unset too. There is no way of untying the
variables without unsetting them, or converting the type of
one of them with another typeset command; +T does not work,
assign- ing an array to SCALAR is an error, and assigning a
scalar to array sets it to be a single-element array. Note
that both typeset -xT ... and export -T ... work, but only
the scalar will be marked for export. Setting the value
using the scalar version causes a split on all separators
(which cannot be quoted).</p>

<p>The -g (global) flag is treated specially: it means that
any resulting parameter will not be restricted to local
scope. Note that this does not necessarily mean that the
parameter will be global, as the flag will apply to any
existing parameter (even if unset) from an enclosing
function. This flag does not affect the parameter after
creation, hence it has no effect when list- ing existing
parameters, nor does the flag +g have any effect except in
combination with -m (see below).</p>

<p>If no name is present, the names and values of all
parameters are printed. In this case the attribute flags
restrict the dis- play to only those parameters that have
the specified attributes, and using + rather than - to
introduce the flag suppresses printing of the values of
parameters when there is no parameter name. Also, if the
last option is the word +, then names are printed but values
are not.</p>

<p>If the -m flag is given the name arguments are taken as
patterns (which should be quoted). With no attribute flags,
all parame- ters (or functions with the -f flag) with
matching names are printed (the shell option TYPESET_SILENT
is not used in this case). Note that -m is ignored if no
patterns are given. If the +g flag is combined with -m, a
new local parameter is cre- ated for every matching
parameter that is not already local. Otherwise -m applies
all other flags or assignments to the existing parameters.
Except when assignments are made with name=value, using +m
forces the matching parameters to be printed, even inside a
function.</p>

<p>If no attribute flags are given and either no -m flag is
present or the +m form was used, each parameter name printed
is preceded by a list of the attributes of that parameter
(array, associa- tion, exported, integer, readonly). If +m
is used with attribute flags, and all those flags are
introduced with +, the matching parameter names are printed
but their values are not.</p>

<p>Attribute flags that transform the final value (-L, -R,
-Z, -l, u) are only applied to the expanded value at the
point of a parameter expansion expression using $. They are
not applied when a parameter is retrieved internally by the
shell for any purpose.</p>

<p>The following attribute flags may be specified:</p>

<p>-A The names refer to associative array parameters; see
Array Parameters in zshparam(1).</p>

<p>-L Left justify and remove leading blanks from value. If
n is nonzero, it defines the width of the field. If n is
zero, the width is determined by the width of the value of
the first assignment. In the case of numeric parame- ters,
the length of the complete value assigned to the parameter
is used to determine the width, not the value that would be
output.</p>

<p>The width is the count of characters, which may be
multi- byte characters if the MULTIBYTE option is in effect.
Note that the screen width of the character is not taken
into account; if this is required, use padding with
parameter expansion flags ${(ml...)...} as described in
Parameter Expansion Flags in zshexpn(1).</p>

<p>When the parameter is expanded, it is filled on the
right with blanks or truncated if necessary to fit the
field. Note truncation can lead to unexpected results with
numeric parameters. Leading zeros are removed if the -Z flag
is also set.</p>

<p>-R Similar to -L, except that right justification is
used; when the parameter is expanded, the field is left
filled with blanks or truncated from the end. May not be
com- bined with the -Z flag.</p>

<p>-U For arrays (but not for associative arrays), keep
only the first occurrence of each duplicated value. This may
also be set for colon-separated special parameters like PATH
or FIGNORE, etc. This flag has a different meaning when used
with -f; see below.</p>

<p>-Z Specially handled if set along with the -L flag.
Other- wise, similar to -R, except that leading zeros are
used for padding instead of blanks if the first non-blank
character is a digit. Numeric parameters are specially
handled: they are always eligible for padding with zeroes,
and the zeroes are inserted at an appropriate place in the
output.</p>

<p>-a The names refer to array parameters. An array
parameter may be created this way, but it may not be
assigned to in the typeset statement. When displaying, both
normal and associative arrays are shown.</p>

<p>-f The names refer to functions rather than parameters.
No assignments can be made, and the only other valid flags
are -t, -k, -u, -U and -z. The flag -t turns on execu- tion
tracing for this function. The -u and -U flags cause the
function to be marked for autoloading; -U also causes alias
expansion to be suppressed when the function is loaded. The
fpath parameter will be searched to find the function
definition when the function is first refer- enced; see the
section Functions. The -k and -z flags make the function be
loaded using ksh-style or zsh-style autoloading
respectively. If neither is given, the set- ting of the
KSH_AUTOLOAD option determines how the func- tion is
loaded.</p>

<p>-h Hide: only useful for special parameters (those
marked &lt;S&gt; in the table in zshparam(1)), and for local
parame- ters with the same name as a special parameter,
though harmless for others. A special parameter with this
attribute will not retain its special effect when made
local. Thus after typeset -h PATH , a function contain- ing
typeset PATH will create an ordinary local parame- ter
without the usual behaviour of PATH. Alternatively, the
local parameter may itself be given this attribute; hence
inside a function typeset -h PATH creates an ordinary local
parameter and the special PATH parameter is not altered in
any way. It is also possible to create a local parameter
using typeset +h special, where the local copy of special
will retain its special properties regardless of having the
-h attribute. Global special parameters loaded from shell
modules (currently those in zsh/mapfile and zsh/parameter)
are automatically given the -h attribute to avoid name
clashes.</p>

<p>-H Hide value: specifies that typeset will not display
the value of the parameter when listing parameters; the dis-
play for such parameters is always as if the + flag had been
given. Use of the parameter is in other respects normal, and
the option does not apply if the parameter is specified by
name, or by pattern with the -m option. This is on by
default for the parameters in the zsh/parameter and
zsh/mapfile modules. Note, however, that unlike the -h flag
this is also useful for non-spe- cial parameters.</p>

<p>-i Use an internal integer representation. If n is
nonzero it defines the output arithmetic base, otherwise it
is determined by the first assignment. Bases from 2 to 36
inclusive are allowed.</p>

<p>-E Use an internal double-precision floating point
represen- tation. On output the variable will be converted
to sci- entific notation. If n is nonzero it defines the
number of significant figures to display; the default is
ten.</p>

<p>-F Use an internal double-precision floating point
represen- tation. On output the variable will be converted
to fixed-point decimal notation. If n is nonzero it defines
the number of digits to display after the decimal point; the
default is ten.</p>

<p>-l Convert the result to lower case whenever the
parameter is expanded. The value is not converted when
assigned.</p>

<p>-r The given names are marked readonly. Note that if
name is a special parameter, the readonly attribute can be
turned on, but cannot then be turned off.</p>

<p>-t Tags the named parameters. Tags have no special
meaning to the shell. This flag has a different meaning when
used with -f; see above.</p>

<p>-u Convert the result to upper case whenever the
parameter is expanded. The value is not converted when
assigned. This flag has a different meaning when used with
-f; see above.</p>

<p>-x Mark for automatic export to the environment of
subse- quently executed commands. If the option
GLOBAL_EXPORT is set, this implies the option -g, unless +g
is also explicitly given; in other words the parameter is
not made local to the enclosing function. This is for com-
patibility with previous versions of zsh.</p>

<p>ulimit [ [ -SHacdfilmnpqstvx | -N resource [ limit ] ...
] Set or display resource limits of the shell and the
processes started by the shell. The value of limit can be a
number in the unit specified below or one of the values
unlimited, which removes the limit on the resource, or hard,
which uses the current value of the hard limit on the
resource.</p>

<p>By default, only soft limits are manipulated. If the -H
flag is given use hard limits instead of soft limits. If the
-S flag is given together with the -H flag set both hard and
soft limits.</p>

<p>If no options are used, the file size limit (-f) is
assumed.</p>

<p>If limit is omitted the current value of the specified
resources are printed. When more than one resource value is
printed, the limit name and unit is printed before each
value.</p>

<p>When looping over multiple resources, the shell will
abort imme- diately if it detects a badly formed argument.
However, if it fails to set a limit for some other reason it
will continue try- ing to set the remaining limits.</p>

<p>-a Lists all of the current resource limits. -c 512-byte
blocks on the size of core dumps. -d K-bytes on the size of
the data segment. -f 512-byte blocks on the size of files
written. -i The number of pending signals. -l K-bytes on the
size of locked-in memory. -m K-bytes on the size of physical
memory. -n open file descriptors. -q Bytes in POSIX message
queues. -s K-bytes on the size of the stack. -t CPU seconds
to be used. -u processes available to the user. -v K-bytes
on the size of virtual memory. On some systems this refers
to the limit called address space. -x The number of locks on
files.</p>

<p>A resource may also be specified by integer in the form
-N resource, where resource corresponds to the integer
defined for the resource by the operating system. This may
be used to set the limits for resources known to the shell
which do not corre- spond to option letters. Such limits
will be shown by number in the output of ulimit -a.</p>

<p>The number may alternatively be out of the range of
limits com- piled into the shell. The shell will try to read
or write the limit anyway, and will report an error if this
fails.</p>

<p>umask [ -S ] [ mask ] The umask is set to mask. mask can
be either an octal number or a symbolic value as described
in chmod(1). If mask is omitted, the current value is
printed. The -S option causes the mask to be printed as a
symbolic value. Otherwise, the mask is printed as an octal
number. Note that in the symbolic form the permis- sions you
specify are those which are to be allowed (not denied) to
the users specified.</p>

<p>unalias Same as unhash -a.</p>

<p>unfunction Same as unhash -f.</p>

<p>unhash [ -adfms ] name ... Remove the element named name
from an internal hash table. The default is remove elements
from the command hash table. The -a option causes unhash to
remove regular or global aliases; note when removing a
global aliases that the argument must be quoted to prevent
it from being expanded before being passed to the command.
The -s option causes unhash to remove suffix aliases. The -f
option causes unhash to remove shell functions. The -d
options causes unhash to remove named directories. If the -m
flag is given the arguments are taken as patterns (should be
quoted) and all elements of the corresponding hash table
with matching names will be removed.</p>

<p>unlimit [ -hs ] resource ... The resource limit for each
resource is set to the hard limit. If the -h flag is given
and the shell has appropriate privi- leges, the hard
resource limit for each resource is removed. The resources
of the shell process are only changed if the -s flag is
given.</p>

<p>The unlimit command is not made available by default
when the shell starts in a mode emulating another shell. It
can be made available with the command zmodload -F
zsh/rlimits b:unlimit.</p>

<p>unset [ -fmv ] name ... Each named parameter is unset.
Local parameters remain local even if unset; they appear
unset within scope, but the previous value will still
reappear when the scope ends.</p>

<p>Individual elements of associative array parameters may
be unset by using subscript syntax on name, which should be
quoted (or the entire command prefixed with noglob) to
protect the sub- script from filename generation.</p>

<p>If the -m flag is specified the arguments are taken as
patterns (should be quoted) and all parameters with matching
names are unset. Note that this cannot be used when
unsetting associative array elements, as the subscript will
be treated as part of the pattern.</p>

<p>The -v flag specifies that name refers to parameters.
This is the default behaviour.</p>

<p>unset -f is equivalent to unfunction.</p>

<p>unsetopt [ {+|-}options | {+|-}o option_name ] [ name
... ] Unset the options for the shell. All options specified
either with flags or by name are unset. If no arguments are
supplied, the names of all options currently unset are
printed. If the -m flag is given the arguments are taken as
patterns (which should be quoted to preserve them from being
interpreted as glob pat- terns), and all options with names
matching these patterns are unset.</p>

<p>vared See the section Zle Builtins in zshzle(1).</p>

<p>wait [ job ... ] Wait for the specified jobs or
processes. If job is not given then all currently active
child processes are waited for. Each job can be either a job
specification or the process ID of a job in the job table.
The exit status from this command is that of the job waited
for.</p>

<p>whence [ -vcwfpams ] name ... For each name, indicate
how it would be interpreted if used as a command name.</p>

<p>-v Produce a more verbose report.</p>

<p>-c Print the results in a csh-like format. This takes
precedence over -v.</p>

<p>-w For each name, print name: word where word is one of
alias, builtin, command, function, hashed, reserved or none,
according as name corresponds to an alias, a built-in
command, an external command, a shell function, a command
defined with the hash builtin, a reserved word, or is not
recognised. This takes precedence over -v and -c.</p>

<p>-f Causes the contents of a shell function to be
displayed, which would otherwise not happen unless the -c
flag were used.</p>

<p>-p Do a path search for name even if it is an alias,
reserved word, shell function or builtin.</p>

<p>-a Do a search for all occurrences of name throughout
the command path. Normally only the first occurrence is
printed.</p>

<p>-m The arguments are taken as patterns (should be
quoted), and the information is displayed for each command
match- ing one of these patterns.</p>

<p>-s If a pathname contains symlinks, print the
symlink-free pathname as well.</p>

<p>where [ -wpms ] name ... Equivalent to whence -ca.</p>

<p>which [ -wpams ] name ... Equivalent to whence -c.</p>

<p>zcompile [ -U ] [ -z | -k ] [ -R | -M ] file [ name ...
] zcompile -ca [ -m ] [ -R | -M ] file [ name ... ] zcompile
-t file [ name ... ] This builtin command can be used to
compile functions or scripts, storing the compiled form in a
file, and to examine files containing the compiled form.
This allows faster autoloading of functions and execution of
scripts by avoiding parsing of the text when the files are
read.</p>

<p>The first form (without the -c, -a or -t options)
creates a com- piled file. If only the file argument is
given, the output file has the name file.zwc and will be
placed in the same directory as the file. The shell will
load the compiled file instead of the normal function file
when the function is autoloaded; see the section Autoloading
Functions in zshmisc(1) for a descrip- tion of how
autoloaded functions are searched. The extension .zwc stands
for zsh word code.</p>

<p>If there is at least one name argument, all the named
files are compiled into the output file given as the first
argument. If file does not end in .zwc, this extension is
automatically appended. Files containing multiple compiled
functions are called digest files, and are intended to be
used as elements of the FPATH/fpath special array.</p>

<p>The second form, with the -c or -a options, writes the
compiled definitions for all the named functions into file.
For -c, the names must be functions currently defined in the
shell, not those marked for autoloading. Undefined functions
that are marked for autoloading may be written by using the
-a option, in which case the fpath is searched and the
contents of the defini- tion files for those functions, if
found, are compiled into file. If both -c and -a are given,
names of both defined func- tions and functions marked for
autoloading may be given. In either case, the functions in
files written with the -c or -a option will be autoloaded as
if the KSH_AUTOLOAD option were unset.</p>

<p>The reason for handling loaded and not-yet-loaded
functions with different options is that some definition
files for autoloading define multiple functions, including
the function with the same name as the file, and, at the
end, call that function. In such cases the output of
zcompile -c does not include the addi- tional functions
defined in the file, and any other initializa- tion code in
the file is lost. Using zcompile -a captures all this extra
information.</p>

<p>If the -m option is combined with -c or -a, the names
are used as patterns and all functions whose names match one
of these patterns will be written. If no name is given, the
definitions of all functions currently defined or marked as
autoloaded will be written.</p>

<p>The third form, with the -t option, examines an existing
com- piled file. Without further arguments, the names of the
original files compiled into it are listed. The first line
of output shows the version of the shell which compiled the
file and how the file will be used (i.e. by reading it
directly or by mapping it into memory). With arguments,
nothing is output and the return status is set to zero if
definitions for all names were found in the compiled file,
and non-zero if the definition for at least one name was not
found.</p>

<p>Other options:</p>

<p>-U Aliases are not expanded when compiling the named
files.</p>

<p>-R When the compiled file is read, its contents are
copied into the shell s memory, rather than memory-mapped
(see -M). This happens automatically on systems that do not
support memory mapping.</p>

<p>When compiling scripts instead of autoloadable
functions, it is often desirable to use this option;
otherwise the whole file, including the code to define
functions which have already been defined, will remain
mapped, conse- quently wasting memory.</p>

<p>-M The compiled file is mapped into the shells memory
when read. This is done in such a way that multiple
instances of the shell running on the same host will share
this mapped file. If neither -R nor -M is given, the
zcompile builtin decides what to do based on the size of the
com- piled file.</p>

<p>-k -z These options are used when the compiled file
contains functions which are to be autoloaded. If -z is
given, the function will be autoloaded as if the
KSH_AUTOLOAD option is not set, even if it is set at the
time the compiled file is read, while if the -k is given,
the function will be loaded as if KSH_AUTOLOAD is set. These
options also take precedence over any -k or -z options
specified to the autoload builtin. If neither of these
options is given, the function will be loaded as determined
by the setting of the KSH_AUTOLOAD option at the time the
com- piled file is read.</p>

<p>These options may also appear as many times as necessary
between the listed names to specify the loading style of all
following functions, up to the next -k or -z.</p>

<p>The created file always contains two versions of the
com- piled format, one for big-endian machines and one for
small-endian machines. The upshot of this is that the
compiled file is machine independent and if it is read or
mapped, only one half of the file is actually used (and
mapped).</p>

<p>zmodload [ -dL ] [ ... ] zmodload -F [ -lLme -P param ]
module [+-]feature... zmodload -e [ -A ] [ ... ] zmodload [
-a [ -bcpf [ -I ] ] ] [ -iL ] ... zmodload -u [ -abcdpf [ -I
] ] [ -iL ] ... zmodload -A [ -L ] [ modalias[=module] ... ]
zmodload -R modalias ... Performs operations relating to zsh
s loadable modules. Loading of modules while the shell is
running (dynamical loading) is not available on all
operating systems, or on all installations on a particular
operating system, although the zmodload command itself is
always available and can be used to manipulate modules built
into versions of the shell executable without dynamical
loading.</p>

<p>Without arguments the names of all currently loaded
binary modules are printed. The -L option causes this list
to be in the form of a series of zmodload commands. Forms
with arguments are:</p>

<p>zmodload [ -i ] name ... zmodload -u [ -i ] name ... In
the simplest case, zmodload loads a binary module. The
module must be in a file with a name consisting of the
specified name followed by a standard suffix, usually .so
(.sl on HPUX). If the module to be loaded is already loaded
the duplicate module is ignored. If zmod- load detects an
inconsistency, such as an invalid module name or circular
dependency list, the current code block is aborted. Hence
zmodload module 2&gt;/dev/null is suf- ficient to test
whether a module is available. If it is available, the
module is loaded if necessary, while if it is not available,
non-zero status is silently returned. The option -i is
accepted for compatibility but has no effect.</p>

<p>The named module is searched for in the same way a com-
mand is, using $module_path instead of $path. However, the
path search is performed even when the module name contains
a / , which it usually does. There is no way to prevent the
path search.</p>

<p>If the module supports features (see below), zmodload
tries to enable all features when loading a module. If the
module was successfully loaded but not all features could be
enabled, zmodload returns status 2.</p>

<p>With -u, zmodload unloads modules. The same name must be
given that was given when the module was loaded, but it is
not necessary for the module to exist in the file sys- tem.
The -i option suppresses the error if the module is already
unloaded (or was never loaded).</p>

<p>Each module has a boot and a cleanup function. The mod-
ule will not be loaded if its boot function fails. Simi-
larly a module can only be unloaded if its cleanup func-
tion runs successfully.</p>

<p>zmodload -F [ -almLe -P param ] module [+-]feature...
zmodload -F allows more selective control over the fea-
tures provided by modules. With no options apart from -F,
the module named module is loaded, if it was not already
loaded, and the list of features is set to the required
state. If no features are specified, the module is loaded,
if it was not already loaded, but the state of features is
unchanged. Each feature may be preceded by a + to turn the
feature on, or - to turn it off; the + is assumed if neither
character is present. Any feature not explicitly mentioned
is left in its current state; if the module was not
previously loaded this means any such fea- tures will remain
disabled. The return status is zero if all features were
set, 1 if the module failed to load, and 2 if some features
could not be set (for example, a parameter couldnt be added
because there was a different parameter of the same name)
but the module was loaded.</p>

<p>The standard features are builtins, conditions, parame-
ters and math functions; these are indicated by the pre- fix
b:, c: (C: for an infix condition), p: and f:, respectively,
followed by the name that the corre- sponding feature would
have in the shell. For example, b:strftime indicates a
builtin named strftime and p:EPOCHSECONDS indicates a
parameter named EPOCHSECONDS. The module may provide other (
abstract ) features of its own as indicated by its
documentation; these have no pre- fix.</p>

<p>With -l or -L, features provided by the module are
listed. With -l alone, a list of features together with
their states is shown, one feature per line. With -L alone,
a zmodload -F command that would cause enabled features of
the module to be turned on is shown. With -lL, a zmodload -F
command that would cause all the features to be set to their
current state is shown. If one of these combinations is
given the option -P param then the parameter param is set to
an array of features, either features together with their
state or (if -L alone is given) enabled features.</p>

<p>With the option -L the module name may be omitted; then
a list of all enabled features for all modules providing
features is printed in the form of zmodload -F commands. If
-l is also given, the state of both enabled and dis- abled
features is output in that form.</p>

<p>A set of features may be provided together with -l or -L
and a module name; in that case only the state of those
features is considered. Each feature may be preceded by + or
- but the character has no effect. If no set of features is
provided, all features are considered.</p>

<p>With -e, the command first tests that the module is
loaded; if it is not, status 1 is returned. If the mod- ule
is loaded, the list of features given as an argument is
examined. Any feature given with no prefix is simply tested
to see if the module provides it; any feature given with a
prefix + or - is tested to see if is pro- vided and in the
given state. If the tests on all fea- tures in the list
succeed, status 0 is returned, else status 1.</p>

<p>With -m, each entry in the given list of features is
taken as a pattern to be matched against the list of fea-
tures provided by the module. An initial + or - must be
given explicitly. This may not be combined with the -a
option as autoloads must be specified explicitly.</p>

<p>With -a, the given list of features is marked for
autoload from the specified module, which may not yet be
loaded. An optional + may appear before the feature name. If
the feature is prefixed with -, any existing autoload is
removed. The options -l and -L may be used to list
autoloads. Autoloading is specific to individual features;
when the module is loaded only the requested feature is
enabled. Autoload requests are preserved if the module is
subsequently unloaded until an explicit zmodload -Fa module
-feature is issued. It is not an error to request an
autoload for a feature of a module that is already
loaded.</p>

<p>When the module is loaded each autoload is checked
against the features actually provided by the module; if the
feature is not provided the autoload request is deleted. A
warning message is output; if the module is being loaded to
provide a different feature, and that autoload is
successful, there is no effect on the status of the current
command. If the module is already loaded at the time when
zmodload -Fa is run, an error message is printed and status
1 returned.</p>

<p>zmodload -Fa can be used with the -l, -L, -e and -P
options for listing and testing the existence of
autoloadable features. In this case -l is ignored if -L is
specified. zmodload -FaL with no module name lists autoloads
for all modules.</p>

<p>Note that only standard features as described above can
be autoloaded; other features require the module to be
loaded before enabling.</p>

<p>zmodload -d [ -L ] [ name ] zmodload -d name dep ...
zmodload -ud name [ dep ... ] The -d option can be used to
specify module dependencies. The modules named in the second
and subsequent arguments will be loaded before the module
named in the first argu- ment.</p>

<p>With -d and one argument, all dependencies for that mod-
ule are listed. With -d and no arguments, all module
dependencies are listed. This listing is by default in a
Makefile-like format. The -L option changes this format to a
list of zmodload -d commands.</p>

<p>If -d and -u are both used, dependencies are removed. If
only one argument is given, all dependencies for that module
are removed.</p>

<p>zmodload -ab [ -L ] zmodload -ab [ -i ] name [ builtin
... ] zmodload -ub [ -i ] builtin ... The -ab option defines
autoloaded builtins. It defines the specified builtins. When
any of those builtins is called, the module specified in the
first argument is loaded and all its features are enabled
(for selective control of features use zmodload -F -a as
described above). If only the name is given, one builtin is
defined, with the same name as the module. -i suppresses the
error if the builtin is already defined or autoloaded, but
not if another builtin of the same name is already
defined.</p>

<p>With -ab and no arguments, all autoloaded builtins are
listed, with the module name (if different) shown in
parentheses after the builtin name. The -L option changes
this format to a list of zmodload -a commands.</p>

<p>If -b is used together with the -u option, it removes
builtins previously defined with -ab. This is only pos-
sible if the builtin is not yet loaded. -i suppresses the
error if the builtin is already removed (or never
existed).</p>

<p>Autoload requests are retained if the module is subse-
quently unloaded until an explicit zmodload -ub builtin is
issued.</p>

<p>zmodload -ac [ -IL ] zmodload -ac [ -iI ] name [ cond
... ] zmodload -uc [ -iI ] cond ... The -ac option is used
to define autoloaded condition codes. The cond strings give
the names of the conditions defined by the module. The
optional -I option is used to define infix condition names.
Without this option prefix condition names are defined.</p>

<p>If given no condition names, all defined names are
listed (as a series of zmodload commands if the -L option is
given).</p>

<p>The -uc option removes definitions for autoloaded condi-
tions.</p>

<p>zmodload -ap [ -L ] zmodload -ap [ -i ] name [ parameter
... ] zmodload -up [ -i ] parameter ... The -p option is
like the -b and -c options, but makes zmodload work on
autoloaded parameters instead.</p>

<p>zmodload -af [ -L ] zmodload -af [ -i ] name [ function
... ] zmodload -uf [ -i ] function ... The -f option is like
the -b, -p, and -c options, but makes zmodload work on
autoloaded math functions instead.</p>

<p>zmodload -a [ -L ] zmodload -a [ -i ] name [ builtin ...
] zmodload -ua [ -i ] builtin ... Equivalent to -ab and
-ub.</p>

<p>zmodload -e [ -A ] [ string ... ] The -e option without
arguments lists all loaded modules; if the -A option is also
given, module aliases corre- sponding to loaded modules are
also shown. If arguments are provided, nothing is printed;
the return status is set to zero if all strings given as
arguments are names of loaded modules and to one if at least
on string is not the name of a loaded module. This can be
used to test for the availability of things implemented by
modules. In this case, any aliases are automatically
resolved and the -A flag is not used.</p>

<p>zmodload -A [ -L ] [ modalias[=module] ... ] For each
argument, if both modalias and module are given, define
modalias to be an alias for the module module. If the module
modalias is ever subsequently requested, either via a call
to zmodload or implicitly, the shell will attempt to load
module instead. If module is not given, show the definition
of modalias. If no arguments are given, list all defined
module aliases. When list- ing, if the -L flag was also
given, list the definition as a zmodload command to recreate
the alias.</p>

<p>The existence of aliases for modules is completely inde-
pendent of whether the name resolved is actually loaded as a
module: while the alias exists, loading and unload- ing the
module under any alias has exactly the same effect as using
the resolved name, and does not affect the connection
between the alias and the resolved name which can be removed
either by zmodload -R or by redefin- ing the alias. Chains
of aliases (i.e. where the first resolved name is itself an
alias) are valid so long as these are not circular. As the
aliases take the same format as module names, they may
include path separators: in this case, there is no
requirement for any part of the path named to exist as the
alias will be resolved first. For example, any/old/alias is
always a valid alias.</p>

<p>Dependencies added to aliased modules are actually added
to the resolved module; these remain if the alias is
removed. It is valid to create an alias whose name is one of
the standard shell modules and which resolves to a different
module. However, if a module has dependencies, it will not
be possible to use the module name as an alias as the module
will already be marked as a loadable module in its own
right.</p>

<p>Apart from the above, aliases can be used in the
zmodload command anywhere module names are required.
However, aliases will not be shown in lists of loaded
modules with a bare zmodload.</p>

<p>zmodload -R modalias ... For each modalias argument that
was previously defined as a module alias via zmodload -A,
delete the alias. If any was not defined, an error is caused
and the remainder of the line is ignored.</p>

<p>Note that zsh makes no distinction between modules that
were linked into the shell and modules that are loaded
dynamically. In both cases this builtin command has to be
used to make avail- able the builtins and other things
defined by modules (unless the module is autoloaded on these
definitions). This is true even for systems that dont
support dynamic loading of modules.</p>
