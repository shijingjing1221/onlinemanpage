<p>XKILL(1) XKILL(1)</p>

<p>NAME xkill - kill a client by its X resource</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS xkill [-display displayname] [-id resource]
[-button number] [-frame] [-all]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Xkill is a utility for forcing the X server
to close connections to clients. This program is very
dangerous, but is useful for aborting programs that have
displayed undesired windows on a users screen. If no
resource identifier is given with -id, xkill will display a
special cursor as a prompt for the user to select a window
to be killed. If a pointer button is pressed over a non-root
window, the server will close its connection to the client
that created the window.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -display displayname This option specifies the
name of the X server to contact.</p>

<p>-id resource This option specifies the X identifier for
the resource whose creator is to be aborted. If no resource
is specified, xkill will display a special cursor with which
you should select a window to be kill.</p>

<p>-button number This option specifies the number of
pointer button that should be used in selecting a window to
kill. If the word &quot;any&quot; is specified, any button
on the pointer may be used. By default, the first button in
the pointer map (which is usually the left- most button) is
used.</p>

<p>-all This option indicates that all clients with
top-level windows on the screen should be killed. Xkill will
ask you to select the root window with each of the currently
defined buttons to give you several chances to abort. Use of
this option is highly discouraged.</p>

<p>-frame This option indicates that xkill should ignore
the standard conventions for finding top-level client
windows (which are typically nested inside a window manager
window), and simply believe that you want to kill direct
children of the root.</p>

<p>CAVEATS This command does not provide any warranty that
the application whose connection to the X server is closed
will abort nicely, or even abort at all. All this command
does is to close the connection to the X server. Many
existing applications do indeed abort when their connec-
tion to the X server is closed, but some can choose to
continue.</p>

<p>XDEFAULTS Button Specifies a specific pointer button
number or the word &quot;any&quot; to use when selecting
windows.</p>
