<p>NAME pam_group - PAM module for group access</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pam_group.so</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pam_group PAM module does not
authenticate the user, but instead it grants group
memberships (in the credential setting phase of the
authentication module) to the user. Such memberships are
based on the service they are applying for.</p>

<p>By default rules for group memberships are taken from
config file /etc/security/group.conf.</p>

<p>This module&acute;s usefulness relies on the
file-systems accessible to the user. The point being that
once granted the membership of a group, the user may attempt
to create a setgid binary with a restricted group ownership.
Later, when the user is not given membership to this group,
they can recover group membership with the precompiled
binary. The reason that the file-systems that the user has
access to are so significant, is the fact that when a system
is mounted nosuid the user is unable to create or execute
such a binary file. For this module to provide any level of
security, all file-systems that the user has write access to
should be mounted nosuid.</p>

<p>The pam_group module functions in parallel with the
/etc/group file. If the user is granted any groups based on
the behavior of this module, they are granted in addition to
those entries /etc/group (or equivalent).</p>

<p>OPTIONS This module does not recognise any options.</p>
