<p>DESCRIPTION Wireshark is a GUI network protocol
analyzer. It lets you interactively browse packet data from
a live network or from a previously saved capture file.
Wiresharks native capture file format is libpcap format,
which is also the format used by tcpdump and various other
tools.</p>

<p>Wireshark can read / import the following file
formats:</p>

<p>&middot; libpcap - captures from
Wireshark/TShark/dumpcap, tcpdump, and various other tools

<p>There is no need to tell Wireshark what type of file you
are reading; it will determine the file type by itself.
Wireshark is also capable of reading any of these file
formats if they are compressed using gzip. Wireshark
recognizes this directly from the file; the .gz extension is
not required for this purpose.</p>

<p>Like other protocol analyzers, Wireshark s main window
shows 3 views of a packet. It shows a summary line, briefly
describing what the packet is. A packet details display is
shown, allowing you to drill down to exact protocol or field
that you interested in. Finally, a hex dump shows you
exactly what the packet looks like when it goes over the
wire.</p>

<p>In addition, Wireshark has some features that make it
unique. It can assemble all the packets in a TCP
conversation and show you the ASCII (or EBCDIC, or hex) data
in that conversation. Display filters in Wireshark are very
powerful; more fields are filterable in Wireshark than in
other protocol analyzers, and the syntax you can use to
create your filters is richer. As Wireshark progresses,
expect more and more protocol fields to be allowed in
display filters.</p>

<p>Packet capturing is performed with the pcap library. The
capture filter syntax follows the rules of the pcap library.
This syntax is different from the display filter syntax.</p>

<p>Compressed file support uses (and therefore requires)
the zlib library. If the zlib library is not present,
Wireshark will compile, but will be unable to read
compressed files.</p>

<p>The pathname of a capture file to be read can be
specified with the -r option or can be specified as a
command-line argument.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Most users will want to start Wireshark without
options and configure it from the menus instead. Those users
may just skip this section.</p>

<p>-a &lt;capture autostop condition&gt; Specify a
criterion that specifies when Wireshark is to stop writing
to a capture file. The criterion is of the form test:value,
where test is one of:</p>

<p>duration:value Stop writing to a capture file after
value seconds have elapsed.</p>

<p>filesize:value Stop writing to a capture file after it
reaches a size of value kilobytes (where a kilobyte is 1024
bytes). If this option is used together with the -b option,
Wireshark will stop writing to the current capture file and
switch to the next one if filesize is reached.</p>

<p>files:value Stop writing to capture files after value
number of files were written.</p>

<p>-b &lt;capture ring buffer option&gt; Cause Wireshark to
run in &quot;multiple files&quot; mode. In &quot;multiple
files&quot; mode, Wireshark will write to several capture
files. When the first capture file fills up, Wireshark will
switch writing to the next file and so on.</p>

<p>The created filenames are based on the filename given
with the -w flag, the number of the file and on the creation
date and time, e.g. outfile_00001_20050604120117.pcap,
outfile_00002_20050604120523.pcap, ...</p>

<p>With the files option its also possible to form a
&quot;ring buffer&quot;. This will fill up new files until
the number of files specified, at which point Wireshark will
discard the data in the first file and start writing to that
file and so on. If the files option is not set, new files
filled up until one of the capture stop conditions match (or
until the disk is full).</p>

<p>The criterion is of the form key:value, where key is one
of:</p>

<p>duration:value switch to the next file after value
seconds have elapsed, even if the current file is not
completely filled up.</p>

<p>filesize:value switch to the next file after it reaches
a size of value kilobytes (where a kilobyte is 1024
bytes).</p>

<p>files:value begin again with the first file after value
number of files were written (form a ring buffer). This
value must be less than 100000. Caution should be used when
using large numbers of files: some filesystems do not handle
many files in a single directory well. The files criterion
requires either duration or filesize to be specified to
control when to go to the next file. It should be noted that
each -b parameter takes exactly one criterion; to specify
two criterion, each must be preceded by the -b option.</p>

<p>Example: -b filesize:1024 -b files:5 results in a ring
buffer of five files of size one megabyte.</p>

<p>-B &lt;capture buffer size&gt; Set capture buffer size
(in MB, default is 1MB). This is used by the the capture
driver to buffer packet data until that data can be written
to disk. If you encounter packet drops while capturing, try
to increase this size. Note that, while Wireshark attempts
to set the buffer size to 1MB by default, and can be told to
set it to a larger value, the system or interface on which
youre capturing might silently limit the capture buffer size
to a lower value or raise it to a higher value.</p>

<p>This is available on UNIX systems with libpcap 1.0.0 or
later and on Windows. It is not available on UNIX systems
with earlier versions of libpcap.</p>

<p>This option can occur multiple times. If used before the
first occurrence of the -i option, it sets the default
capture buffer size. If used after an -i option, it sets the
capture buffer size for the interface specified by the last
-i option occurring before this option. If the capture
buffer size is not set specifically, the default capture
buffer size is used if provided.</p>

<p>-c &lt;capture packet count&gt; Set the maximum number
of packets to read when capturing live data.</p>

<p>-C &lt;configuration profile&gt; Start with the given
configuration profile.</p>

<p>-d &lt;display filter&gt; Start with the given display
filter.</p>

<p>-D Print a list of the interfaces on which Wireshark can
capture, and exit. For each network interface, a number and
an interface name, possibly followed by a text description
of the interface, is printed. The interface name or the
number can be supplied to the -i flag to specify an
interface on which to capture.</p>

<p>This can be useful on systems that dont have a command
to list them (e.g., Windows systems, or UNIX systems lacking
ifconfig -a); the number can be useful on Windows 2000 and
later systems, where the interface name is a somewhat
complex string.</p>

<p>Note that &quot;can capture&quot; means that Wireshark
was able to open that device to do a live capture; if, on
your system, a program doing a network capture must be run
from an account with special privileges (for example, as
root), then, if Wireshark is run with the -D flag and is not
run from such an account, it will not list any
interfaces.</p>

<p>--display=&lt;X display to use&gt; Specifies the X
display to use. A hostname and screen (otherhost:0.0) or
just a screen (:0.0) can be specified. This option is not
available under Windows.</p>

<p>-f &lt;capture filter&gt; Set the capture filter
expression.</p>

<p>This option can occur multiple times. If used before the
first occurrence of the -i option, it sets the default
capture filter expression. If used after an -i option, it
sets the capture filter expression for the interface
specified by the last -i option occurring before this
option. If the capture filter expression is not set
specifically, the default capture filter expression is used
if provided.</p>

<p>-g &lt;packet number&gt; After reading in a capture file
using the -r flag, go to the given packet number.</p>

<p>-h Print the version and options and exit.</p>

<p>-H Hide the capture info dialog during live packet
capture.</p>

<p>-i &lt;capture interface&gt;|- Set the name of the
network interface or pipe to use for live packet
capture.</p>

<p>Network interface names should match one of the names
listed in &quot;wireshark -D&quot; (described above); a
number, as reported by &quot;wireshark -D&quot;, can also be
used. If you re using UNIX, &quot;netstat -i&quot; or
&quot;ifconfig -a&quot; might also work to list interface
names, although not all versions of UNIX support the -a flag
to ifconfig.</p>

<p>If no interface is specified, Wireshark searches the
list of interfaces, choosing the first non-loopback
interface if there are any non-loopback interfaces, and
choosing the first loopback interface if there are no
non-loopback interfaces. If there are no interfaces at all,
Wireshark reports an error and doesnt start the capture.</p>

<p>Pipe names should be either the name of a FIFO (named
pipe) or - to read data from the standard input. On Windows
systems, pipe names must be of the form \pipepipename . Data
read from pipes must be in standard libpcap format.</p>

<p>This option can occur multiple times. When capturing
from multiple interfaces, the capture file will be saved in
pcap-ng format.</p>

<p>-I Put the interface in &quot;monitor mode&quot;; this
is supported only on IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi interfaces, and
supported only on some operating systems.</p>

<p>Note that in monitor mode the adapter might disassociate
from the network with which its associated, so that you will
not be able to use any wireless networks with that adapter.
This could prevent accessing files on a network server, or
resolving host names or network addresses, if you are
capturing in monitor mode and are not connected to another
network with another adapter.</p>

<p>This option can occur multiple times. If used before the
first occurrence of the -i option, it enables the monitor
mode for all interfaces. If used after an -i option, it
enables the monitor mode for the interface specified by the
last -i option occurring before this option.</p>

<p>-j Use after -J to change the behavior when no exact
match is found for the filter. With this option select the
first packet before.</p>

<p>-J &lt;jump filter&gt; After reading in a capture file
using the -r flag, jump to the packet matching the filter
(display filter syntax). If no exact match is found the
first packet after that is selected.</p>

<p>-k Start the capture session immediately. If the -i flag
was specified, the capture uses the specified interface.
Otherwise, Wireshark searches the list of interfaces,
choosing the first non- loopback interface if there are any
non-loopback interfaces, and choosing the first loopback
interface if there are no non-loopback interfaces; if there
are no interfaces, Wireshark reports an error and doesnt
start the capture.</p>

<p>-K &lt;keytab&gt; Load kerberos crypto keys from the
specified keytab file. This option can be used multiple
times to load keys from several files.</p>

<p>Example: -K krb5.keytab</p>

<p>-l Turn on automatic scrolling if the packet display is
being updated automatically as packets arrive during a
capture (as specified by the -S flag).</p>

<p>-L List the data link types supported by the interface
and exit.</p>

<p>-m &lt;font&gt; Set the name of the font used by
Wireshark for most text. Wireshark will construct the name
of the bold font used for the data in the byte view pane
that corresponds to the field selected in the packet details
pane from the name of the main text font.</p>

<p>-n Disable network object name resolution (such as
hostname, TCP and UDP port names), the -N flag might
override this one.</p>

<p>-N &lt;name resolving flags&gt; Turn on name resolving
only for particular types of addresses and port numbers,
with name resolving for other types of addresses and port
numbers turned off. This flag overrides -n if both -N and -n
are present. If both -N and -n flags are not present, all
name resolutions are turned on.</p>

<p>The argument is a string that may contain the
letters:</p>

<p>m to enable MAC address resolution</p>

<p>n to enable network address resolution</p>

<p>t to enable transport-layer port number resolution</p>

<p>C to enable concurrent (asynchronous) DNS lookups</p>

<p>-o &lt;preference/recent setting&gt; Set a preference or
recent value, overriding the default value and any value
read from a preference/recent file. The argument to the flag
is a string of the form prefname:value, where prefname is
the name of the preference/recent value (which is the same
name that would appear in the preference/recent file), and
value is the value to which it should be set. Since Ethereal
0.10.12, the recent settings replaces the formerly used -B,
-P and -T flags to manipulate the GUI dimensions.</p>

<p>If prefname is &quot;uat&quot;, you can override
settings in various user access tables using the form
uat:uat filename:uat record. uat filename must be the name
of a UAT file, e.g. user_dlts. uat_record must be in the
form of a valid record for that file, including quotes. For
instance, to specify a user DLT from the command line, you
would use</p>

<p>-o &quot;uat:user_dlts: (DLT=147)</p>

<p>-p Don_t put the interface into promiscuous mode. Note
that the interface might be in promiscuous mode for some
other reason; hence, -p cannot be used to ensure that the
only traffic that is captured is traffic sent to or from the
machine on which Wireshark is running, broadcast traffic,
and multicast traffic to addresses received by that
machine.</p>

<p>This option can occur multiple times. If used before the
first occurrence of the -i option, no interface will be put
into the promiscuous mode. If used after an -i option, the
interface specified by the last -i option occurring before
this option will not be put into the promiscuous mode.</p>

<p>-P &lt;path setting&gt; Special path settings usually
detected automatically. This is used for special cases, e.g.
starting Wireshark from a known location on an USB
stick.</p>

<p>The criterion is of the form key:path, where key is one
of:</p>

<p>persconf:path path of personal configuration files, like
the preferences files.</p>

<p>persdata:path path of personal data files, it s the
folder initially opened. After the very first
initialization, the recent file will keep the folder last
used.</p>

<p>-r &lt;infile&gt; Read packet data from infile, can be
any supported capture file format (including gzipped files).
Its not possible to use named pipes or stdin here! To
capture from a pipe or from stdin use -i -</p>

<p>-R &lt;read (display) filter&gt; When reading a capture
file specified with the -r flag, causes the specified filter
(which uses the syntax of display filters, rather than that
of capture filters) to be applied to all packets read from
the capture file; packets not matching the filter are
discarded.</p>

<p>-s &lt;capture snaplen&gt; Set the default snapshot
length to use when capturing live data. No more than snaplen
bytes of each network packet will be read into memory, or
saved to disk. A value of 0 specifies a snapshot length of
65535, so that the full packet is captured; this is the
default.</p>

<p>This option can occur multiple times. If used before the
first occurrence of the -i option, it sets the default
snapshot length. If used after an -i option, it sets the
snapshot length for the interface specified by the last -i
option occurring before this option. If the snapshot length
is not set specifically, the default snapshot length is used
if provided.</p>

<p>-S Automatically update the packet display as packets
are coming in.</p>

<p>-t ad|a|r|d|dd|e Set the format of the packet timestamp
displayed in the packet list window. The format can be one
of:</p>

<p>ad absolute with date: The absolute date and time is the
actual time and date the packet was captured</p>

<p>a absolute: The absolute time is the actual time the
packet was captured, with no date displayed</p>

<p>r relative: The relative time is the time elapsed
between the first packet and the current packet</p>

<p>d delta: The delta time is the time since the previous
packet was captured</p>

<p>dd delta_displayed: The delta_displayed time is the time
since the previous displayed packet was captured</p>

<p>e epoch: The time in seconds since epoch (Jan 1, 1970
00:00:00)</p>

<p>The default format is relative.</p>

<p>-v Print the version and exit.</p>

<p>-w &lt;outfile&gt; Set the default capture file
name.</p>

<p>-X &lt;eXtension options&gt; Specify an option to be
passed to an Wireshark module. The eXtension option is in
the form extension_key:value, where extension_key can
be:</p>

<p>lua_script:lua_script_filename tells Wireshark to load
the given script in addition to the default Lua scripts.</p>

<p>stdin_descr:description tells Wireshark to use the given
description when capturing from standard input (-i -).</p>

<p>-y &lt;capture link type&gt; If a capture is started
from the command line with -k, set the data link type to use
while capturing packets. The values reported by -L are the
values that can be used.</p>

<p>This option can occur multiple times. If used before the
first occurrence of the -i option, it sets the default
capture link type. If used after an -i option, it sets the
capture link type for the interface specified by the last -i
option occurring before this option. If the capture link
type is not set specifically, the default capture link type
is used if provided.</p>

<p>-z &lt;statistics&gt; Get Wireshark to collect various
types of statistics and display the result in a window that
updates in semi-real time.</p>

<p>Currently implemented statistics are:</p>

<p>-z conv,type[,filter] Create a table that lists all
conversations that could be seen in the capture. type
specifies the conversation endpoint types for which we want
to generate the statistics; currently the supported ones
are:</p>

<p>&quot;eth&quot; Ethernet addresses &quot;fc&quot; Fibre
Channel addresses &quot;fddi&quot; FDDI addresses
&quot;ip&quot; IPv4 addresses &quot;ipv6&quot; IPv6
addresses &quot;ipx&quot; IPX addresses &quot;tcp&quot;
TCP/IP socket pairs Both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported
&quot;tr&quot; Token Ring addresses &quot;udp&quot; UDP/IP
socket pairs Both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported</p>

<p>If the optional filter is specified, only those packets
that match the filter will be used in the calculations.</p>

<p>The table is presented with one line for each
conversation and displays the number of packets/bytes in
each direction as well as the total number of packets/bytes.
By default, the table is sorted according to the total
number of packets.</p>

<p>These tables can also be generated at runtime by
selecting the appropriate conversation type from the menu
&quot;Tools/Statistics/Conversation List/&quot;.</p>

<p>-z dcerpc,srt,uuid,major.minor[,filter] Collect
call/reply SRT (Service Response Time) data for DCERPC
interface uuid, version major.minor. Data collected is the
number of calls for each procedure, MinSRT, MaxSRT and
AvgSRT.</p>

<p>Example: -z
dcerpc,srt,12345778-1234-abcd-ef00-0123456789ac,1.0 will
collect data for the CIFS SAMR Interface.</p>

<p>This option can be used multiple times on the command
line.</p>

<p>If the optional filter is provided, the stats will only
be calculated on those calls that match that filter.</p>

<p>Example: -z
dcerpc,srt,12345778-1234-abcd-ef00-0123456789ac,1.0,ip.addr==1.2.3.4
will collect SAMR SRT statistics for a specific host.</p>

<p>-z fc,srt[,filter] Collect call/reply SRT (Service
Response Time) data for FC. Data collected is the number of
calls for each Fibre Channel command, MinSRT, MaxSRT and
AvgSRT.</p>

<p>Example: -z fc,srt will calculate the Service Response
Time as the time delta between the First packet of the
exchange and the Last packet of the exchange.</p>

<p>The data will be presented as separate tables for all
normal FC commands, Only those commands that are seen in the
capture will have its stats displayed.</p>

<p>This option can be used multiple times on the command
line.</p>

<p>If the optional filter is provided, the stats will only
be calculated on those calls that match that filter.</p>

<p>Example: -z &quot;fc,srt,fc.id==01.02.03&quot; will
collect stats only for FC packets exchanged by the host at
FC address 01.02.03 .</p>

<p>-z h225,counter[,filter] Count ITU-T H.225 messages and
their reasons. In the first column you get a list of H.225
messages and H.225 message reasons which occur in the
current capture file. The number of occurrences of each
message or reason is displayed in the second column.</p>

<p>Example: -z h225,counter</p>

<p>This option can be used multiple times on the command
line.</p>

<p>If the optional filter is provided, the stats will only
be calculated on those calls that match that filter.</p>

<p>Example: -z &quot;h225,counter,ip.addr==1.2.3.4&quot;
will collect stats only for H.225 packets exchanged by the
host at IP address 1.2.3.4 .</p>

<p>-z h225,srt[,filter] Collect request/response SRT
(Service Response Time) data for ITU-T H.225 RAS. Data
collected is the number of calls of each ITU-T H.225 RAS
Message Type, Minimum SRT, Maximum SRT, Average SRT, Minimum
in Packet, and Maximum in Packet. You will also get the
number of Open Requests (Unresponded Requests), Discarded
Responses (Responses without matching request) and Duplicate
Messages.</p>

<p>Example: -z h225,srt</p>

<p>This option can be used multiple times on the command
line.</p>

<p>If the optional filter is provided, the stats will only
be calculated on those calls that match that filter.</p>

<p>Example: -z &quot;h225,srt,ip.addr==1.2.3.4&quot; will
collect stats only for ITU-T H.225 RAS packets exchanged by
the host at IP address 1.2.3.4 .</p>

<p>-z io,stat Collect packet/bytes statistics for the
capture in intervals of 1 second. This option will open a
window with up to 5 color- coded graphs where
number-of-packets-per-second or number-of- bytes-per-second
statistics can be calculated and displayed.</p>

<p>This option can be used multiple times on the command
line.</p>

<p>This graph window can also be opened from the
Analyze:Statistics:Traffic:IO-Stat menu item.</p>

<p>-z ldap,srt[,filter] Collect call/reply SRT (Service
Response Time) data for LDAP. Data collected is the number
of calls for each implemented LDAP command, MinSRT, MaxSRT
and AvgSRT.</p>

<p>Example: -z ldap,srt will calculate the Service Response
Time as the time delta between the Request and the
Response.</p>

<p>The data will be presented as separate tables for all
implemented LDAP commands, Only those commands that are seen
in the capture will have its stats displayed.</p>

<p>This option can be used multiple times on the command
line.</p>

<p>If the optional filter is provided, the stats will only
be calculated on those calls that match that filter.</p>

<p>Example: use -z &quot;ldap,srt,ip.addr==10.1.1.1&quot;
will collect stats only for LDAP packets exchanged by the
host at IP address 10.1.1.1 .</p>

<p>The only LDAP commands that are currently implemented
and for which the stats will be available are: BIND SEARCH
MODIFY ADD DELETE MODRDN COMPARE EXTENDED</p>

<p>-z megaco,srt[,filter] Collect request/response SRT
(Service Response Time) data for MEGACO. (This is similar to
-z smb,srt). Data collected is the number of calls for each
known MEGACO Command, Minimum SRT, Maximum SRT and Average
SRT.</p>

<p>Example: -z megaco,srt</p>

<p>This option can be used multiple times on the command
line.</p>

<p>If the optional filter is provided, the stats will only
be calculated on those calls that match that filter.</p>

<p>Example: -z &quot;megaco,srt,ip.addr==1.2.3.4&quot; will
collect stats only for MEGACO packets exchanged by the host
at IP address 1.2.3.4 .</p>

<p>-z mgcp,srt[,filter] Collect request/response SRT
(Service Response Time) data for MGCP. (This is similar to
-z smb,srt). Data collected is the number of calls for each
known MGCP Type, Minimum SRT, Maximum SRT and Average
SRT.</p>

<p>Example: -z mgcp,srt</p>

<p>This option can be used multiple times on the command
line.</p>

<p>If the optional filter is provided, the stats will only
be calculated on those calls that match that filter.</p>

<p>Example: -z &quot;mgcp,srt,ip.addr==1.2.3.4&quot; will
collect stats only for MGCP packets exchanged by the host at
IP address 1.2.3.4 .</p>

<p>-z rpc,programs Collect call/reply SRT data for all
known ONC-RPC programs/versions. Data collected is the
number of calls for each protocol/version, MinSRT, MaxSRT
and AvgSRT.</p>

<p>-z rpc,srt,program,version[,&lt;filter&gt;] Collect
call/reply SRT (Service Response Time) data for
program/version. Data collected is the number of calls for
each procedure, MinSRT, MaxSRT and AvgSRT.</p>

<p>Example: -z rpc,srt,100003,3 will collect data for NFS
v3.</p>

<p>This option can be used multiple times on the command
line.</p>

<p>If the optional filter is provided, the stats will only
be calculated on those calls that match that filter.</p>

<p>Example: -z rpc,srt,100003,3,nfs.fh.hash==0x12345678
will collect NFS v3 SRT statistics for a specific file.</p>

<p>-z scsi,srt,cmdset[,&lt;filter&gt;] Collect call/reply
SRT (Service Response Time) data for SCSI commandset
&lt;cmdset&gt;.</p>

<p>Commandsets are 0:SBC 1:SSC 5:MMC</p>

<p>Data collected is the number of calls for each
procedure, MinSRT, MaxSRT and AvgSRT.</p>

<p>Example: -z scsi,srt,0 will collect data for SCSI BLOCK
COMMANDS (SBC).</p>

<p>This option can be used multiple times on the command
line.</p>

<p>If the optional filter is provided, the stats will only
be calculated on those calls that match that filter.</p>

<p>Example: -z scsi,srt,0,ip.addr==1.2.3.4 will collect
SCSI SBC SRT statistics for a specific iscsi/ifcp/fcip
host.</p>

<p>-z sip,stat[,filter] This option will activate a counter
for SIP messages. You will get the number of occurrences of
each SIP Method and of each SIP Status-Code. Additionally
you also get the number of resent SIP Messages (only for SIP
over UDP).</p>

<p>Example: -z sip,stat</p>

<p>This option can be used multiple times on the command
line.</p>

<p>If the optional filter is provided, the stats will only
be calculated on those calls that match that filter.</p>

<p>Example: -z &quot;sip,stat,ip.addr==1.2.3.4&quot; will
collect stats only for SIP packets exchanged by the host at
IP address 1.2.3.4 .</p>

<p>-z smb,srt[,filter] Collect call/reply SRT (Service
Response Time) data for SMB. Data collected is the number of
calls for each SMB command, MinSRT, MaxSRT and AvgSRT.</p>

<p>Example: -z smb,srt</p>

<p>The data will be presented as separate tables for all
normal SMB commands, all Transaction2 commands and all NT
Transaction commands. Only those commands that are seen in
the capture will have their stats displayed. Only the first
command in a xAndX command chain will be used in the
calculation. So for common SessionSetupAndX +
TreeConnectAndX chains, only the SessionSetupAndX call will
be used in the statistics. This is a flaw that might be
fixed in the future.</p>

<p>This option can be used multiple times on the command
line.</p>

<p>If the optional filter is provided, the stats will only
be calculated on those calls that match that filter.</p>

<p>Example: -z &quot;smb,srt,ip.addr==1.2.3.4&quot; will
collect stats only for SMB packets exchanged by the host at
IP address 1.2.3.4 .</p>

<p>-z voip,calls This option will show a window that shows
VoIP calls found in the capture file. This is the same
window shown as when you go to the Statistics Menu and
choose VoIP Calls.</p>

<p>Example: -z voip,calls</p>

<p>INTERFACE MENU ITEMS File:Open File:Open Recent
File:Merge Merge another capture file to the currently
loaded one. The File:Merge dialog box allows the merge
&quot;Prepended&quot;, &quot;Chronologically&quot; or
&quot;Appended&quot;, relative to the already loaded
one.</p>

<p>File:Close Open or close a capture file. The File:Open
dialog box allows a filter to be specified; when the capture
file is read, the filter is applied to all packets read from
the file, and packets not matching the filter are discarded.
The File:Open Recent is a submenu and will show a list of
previously opened files.</p>

<p>File:Save File:Save As Save the current capture, or the
packets currently displayed from that capture, to a file.
Check boxes let you select whether to save all packets, or
just those that have passed the current display filter
and/or those that are currently marked, and an option menu
lets you select (from a list of file formats in which at
particular capture, or the packets currently displayed from
that capture, can be saved), a file format in which to save
it.</p>

<p>File:File Set:List Files Show a dialog box that lists
all files of the file set matching the currently loaded
file. A file set is a compound of files resulting from a
capture using the &quot;multiple files&quot; /
&quot;ringbuffer&quot; mode, recognizable by the filename
pattern, e.g.: Filename_00001_20050604101530.pcap.</p>

<p>File:File Set:Next File File:File Set:Previous File If
the currently loaded file is part of a file set (see above),
open the next / previous file in that set.</p>

<p>File:Export Export captured data into an external
format. Note: the data cannot be imported back into
Wireshark, so be sure to keep the capture file.</p>

<p>File:Print Print packet data from the current capture.
You can select the range of packets to be printed (which
packets are printed), and the output format of each packet
(how each packet is printed). The output format will be
similar to the displayed values, so a summary line, the
packet details view, and/or the hex dump of the packet can
be printed.</p>

<p>Printing options can be set with the Edit:Preferences
menu item, or in the dialog box popped up by this menu
item.</p>

<p>File:Quit Exit the application.</p>

<p>Edit:Copy:Description Copies the description of the
selected field in the protocol tree to the clipboard.</p>

<p>Edit:Copy:Fieldname Copies the fieldname of the selected
field in the protocol tree to the clipboard.</p>

<p>Edit:Copy:Value Copies the value of the selected field
in the protocol tree to the clipboard.</p>

<p>Edit:Copy:As Filter Create a display filter based on the
data currently highlighted in the packet details and copy
that filter to the clipboard.</p>

<p>If that data is a field that can be tested in a display
filter expression, the display filter will test that field;
otherwise, the display filter will be based on the absolute
offset within the packet. Therefore it could be unreliable
if the packet contains protocols with variable-length
headers, such as a source-routed token-ring packet.</p>

<p>Edit:Find Packet Search forward or backward, starting
with the currently selected packet (or the most recently
selected packet, if no packet is selected). Search criteria
can be a display filter expression, a string of hexadecimal
digits, or a text string.</p>

<p>When searching for a text string, you can search the
packet data, or you can search the text in the Info column
in the packet list pane or in the packet details pane.</p>

<p>Hexadecimal digits can be separated by colons, periods,
or dashes. Text string searches can be ASCII or Unicode (or
both), and may be case insensitive.</p>

<p>Edit:Find Next Edit:Find Previous Search forward /
backward for a packet matching the filter from the previous
search, starting with the currently selected packet (or the
most recently selected packet, if no packet is
selected).</p>

<p>Edit:Mark Packet (toggle) Mark (or unmark if currently
marked) the selected packet. The field
&quot;frame.marked&quot; is set for packets that are marked,
so that, for example, a display filters can be used to
display only marked packets, and so that the &quot;Edit:Find
Packet&quot; dialog can be used to find the next or previous
marked packet.</p>

<p>Edit:Find Next Mark Edit:Find Previous Mark Find
next/previous marked packet.</p>

<p>Edit:Mark All Packets Edit:Unmark All Packets Mark /
Unmark all packets that are currently displayed.</p>

<p>Edit:Time Reference:Set Time Reference (toggle) Set (or
unset if currently set) the selected packet as a Time
Reference packet. When a packet is set as a Time Reference
packet, the timestamps in the packet list pane will be
replaced with the string &quot;*REF*&quot;. The relative
time timestamp in later packets will then be calculated
relative to the timestamp of this Time Reference packet and
not the first packet in the capture.</p>

<p>Packets that have been selected as Time Reference
packets will always be displayed in the packet list pane.
Display filters will not affect or hide these packets.</p>

<p>If there is a column displayed for &quot;Cumulative
Bytes&quot; this counter will be reset at every Time
Reference packet.</p>

<p>Edit:Time Reference:Find Next Edit:Time Reference:Find
Previous Search forward / backward for a time referenced
packet.</p>

<p>Edit:Configuration Profiles Manage configuration
profiles to be able to use more than one set of preferences
and configurations.</p>

<p>Edit:Preferences Set the GUI, capture, printing and
protocol options (see &quot;Preferences&quot; dialog
below).</p>

the current packet display.</p>

<p>View:Expand Subtrees Expands the currently selected item
and it s subtrees in the packet details.</p>

<p>View:Expand All View:Collapse All Expand / Collapse all
branches of the packet details.</p>

<p>View:Colorize Conversation Select color for a
conversation.</p>

<p>View:Reset Coloring 1-10 Reset Color for a
conversation.</p>

<p>View:Coloring Rules Change the foreground and background
colors of the packet information in the list of packets,
based upon display filters. The list of display filters is
applied to each packet sequentially. After the first display
filter matches a packet, any additional display filters in
the list are ignored. Therefore, if you are filtering on the
existence of protocols, you should list the higher-level
protocols first, and the lower-level protocols last.</p>

<p>How Colorization Works Packets are colored according to
a list of color filters. Each filter consists of a name, a
filter expression and a coloration. A packet is colored
according to the first filter that it matches. Color filter
expressions use exactly the same syntax as display filter
expressions.</p>

<p>When Wireshark starts, the color filters are loaded
from:</p>

<p>1. The users personal color filters file or, if that
does not exist,</p>

<p>2. The global color filters file.</p>

<p>If neither of these exist then the packets will not be
colored.</p>

<p>View:Show Packet In New Window Create a new window
containing a packet details view and a hex dump window of
the currently selected packet; this window will continue to
display that packet s details and data even if another
packet is selected.</p>

<p>View:Reload Reload a capture file. Same as File:Close
and File:Open the same file again.</p>

<p>Go:Back Go back in previously visited packets
history.</p>

<p>Go:Forward Go forward in previously visited packets
history.</p>

<p>Go:Go To Packet Go to a particular numbered packet.</p>

<p>Go:Go To Corresponding Packet If a field in the packet
details pane containing a packet number is selected, go to
the packet number specified by that field. (This works only
if the dissector that put that entry into the packet details
put it into the details as a filterable field rather than
just as text.) This can be used, for example, to go to the
packet for the request corresponding to a reply, or the
reply corresponding to a request, if that packet number has
been put into the packet details.</p>

<p>Go:Previous Packet Go:Next Packet Go:First Packet
Go:Last Packet Go to the previous / next / first / last
packet in the capture.</p>

<p>Go:Previous Packet In Conversation Go:Next Packet In
Conversation Go to the previous / next packet of the
conversation (TCP, UDP or IP)</p>

<p>Capture:Interfaces Shows a dialog box with all currently
known interfaces and displaying the current network traffic
amount. Capture sessions can be started from here. Beware:
keeping this box open results in high system load!</p>

<p>Capture:Options Initiate a live packet capture (see
&quot;Capture Options Dialog&quot; below). If no filename is
specified, a temporary file will be created to hold the
capture. The location of the file can be chosen by setting
your TMPDIR environment variable before starting Wireshark.
Otherwise, the default TMPDIR location is system- dependent,
but is likely either /var/tmp or /tmp.</p>

<p>Capture:Start Start a live packet capture with the
previously selected options. This wont open the options
dialog box, and can be convenient for repeatedly capturing
with the same options.</p>

<p>Capture:Stop Stop a running live capture.</p>

<p>Capture:Restart While a live capture is running, stop it
and restart with the same options again. This can be
convenient to remove irrelevant packets, if no valuable
packets were captured so far.</p>

<p>Capture:Capture Filters Edit the saved list of capture
filters, allowing filters to be added, changed, or
deleted.</p>

<p>Analyze:Display Filters Edit the saved list of display
filters, allowing filters to be added, changed, or
deleted.</p>

<p>Analyze:Display Filter Macros Create shortcuts for
complex macros</p>

<p>Analyze:Apply as Filter Create a display filter based on
the data currently highlighted in the packet details and
apply the filter.</p>

<p>If that data is a field that can be tested in a display
filter expression, the display filter will test that field;
otherwise, the display filter will be based on the absolute
offset within the packet. Therefore it could be unreliable
if the packet contains protocols with variable-length
headers, such as a source-routed token-ring packet.</p>

<p>The Selected option creates a display filter that tests
for a match of the data; the Not Selected option creates a
display filter that tests for a non-match of the data. The
And Selected, Or Selected, And Not Selected, and Or Not
Selected options add to the end of the display filter in the
strip at the top (or bottom) an AND or OR operator followed
by the new display filter expression.</p>

<p>Analyze:Prepare a Filter Create a display filter based
on the data currently highlighted in the packet details. The
filter strip at the top (or bottom) is updated but it is not
yet applied.</p>

<p>Analyze:Enabled Protocols Allow protocol dissection to
be enabled or disabled for a specific protocol. Individual
protocols can be enabled or disabled by clicking on them in
the list or by highlighting them and pressing the space bar.
The entire list can be enabled, disabled, or inverted using
the buttons below the list.</p>

<p>When a protocol is disabled, dissection in a particular
packet stops when that protocol is reached, and Wireshark
moves on to the next packet. Any higher-layer protocols that
would otherwise have been processed will not be displayed.
For example, disabling TCP will prevent the dissection and
display of TCP, HTTP, SMTP, Telnet, and any other protocol
exclusively dependent on TCP.</p>

<p>The list of protocols can be saved, so that Wireshark
will start up with the protocols in that list disabled.</p>

<p>Analyze:Decode As If you have a packet selected, present
a dialog allowing you to change which dissectors are used to
decode this packet. The dialog has one panel each for the
link layer, network layer and transport layer protocol/port
numbers, and will allow each of these to be changed
independently. For example, if the selected packet is a TCP
packet to port 12345, using this dialog you can instruct
Wireshark to decode all packets to or from that TCP port as
HTTP packets.</p>

<p>Analyze:User Specified Decodes Create a new window
showing whether any protocol ID to dissector mappings have
been changed by the user. This window also allows the user
to reset all decodes to their default values.</p>

<p>Analyze:Follow TCP Stream If you have a TCP packet
selected, display the contents of the data stream for the
TCP connection to which that packet belongs, as text, in a
separate window, and leave the list of packets in a filtered
state, with only those packets that are part of that TCP
connection being displayed. You can revert to your old view
by pressing ENTER in the display filter text box, thereby
invoking your old display filter (or resetting it back to no
display filter).</p>

<p>The window in which the data stream is displayed lets
you select:</p>

<p>&middot; whether to display the entire conversation, or
one or the other side of it;</p>

<p>&middot; whether the data being displayed is to be
treated as ASCII or EBCDIC text or as raw hex data;</p>

<p>and lets you print whats currently being displayed,
using the same print options that are used for the
File:Print Packet menu item, or save it as text to a
file.</p>

<p>Analyze:Follow UDP Stream Analyze:Follow SSL Stream
(Similar to Analyze:Follow TCP Stream)</p>

<p>Analyze:Expert Info Analyze:Expert Info Composite (Kind
of) a log of anomalies found by Wireshark in a capture
file.</p>

<p>Analyze:Conversation Filter Statistics:Summary Show
summary information about the capture, including elapsed
time, packet counts, byte counts, and the like. If a display
filter is in effect, summary information will be shown about
the capture and about the packets currently being
displayed.</p>

<p>Statistics:Protocol Hierarchy Show the number of
packets, and the number of bytes in those packets, for each
protocol in the trace. It organizes the protocols in the
same hierarchy in which they were found in the trace.
Besides counting the packets in which the protocol exists, a
count is also made for packets in which the protocol is the
last protocol in the stack. These last-protocol counts show
you how many packets (and the byte count associated with
those packets) ended in a particular protocol. In the table,
they are listed under &quot;End Packets&quot; and &quot;End
Bytes&quot;.</p>

<p>Statistics:Conversations Lists of conversations;
selectable by protocol. See Statistics:Conversation List
below.</p>

<p>Statistics:End Points List of End Point Addresses by
protocol with packets/bytes/.... counts.</p>

<p>Statistics:Packet Lengths Grouped counts of packet
lengths (0-19 bytes, 20-39 bytes, ...)</p>

<p>Statistics:IO Graphs Open a window where up to 5 graphs
in different colors can be displayed to indicate number of
packets or number of bytes per second for all packets
matching the specified filter. By default only one graph
will be displayed showing number of packets per second.</p>

<p>The top part of the window contains the graphs and
scales for the X and Y axis. If the graph is too long to fit
inside the window there is a horizontal scrollbar below the
drawing area that can scroll the graphs to the left or the
right. The horizontal axis displays the time into the
capture and the vertical axis will display the measured
quantity at that time.</p>

<p>Below the drawing area and the scrollbar are the
controls. On the bottom left there will be five similar sets
of controls to control each individual graph such as
&quot;Display:&lt;button&gt;&quot; which button will toggle
that individual graph on/off. If &lt;button&gt; is ticked,
the graph will be displayed. &quot;Color:&lt;color&gt;&quot;
which is just a button to show which color will be used to
draw that graph (color is only available in Gtk2 version)
and finally &quot;Filter:&lt;filter-text&gt;&quot; which can
be used to specify a display filter for that particular
graph.</p>

<p>If filter-text is empty then all packets will be used to
calculate the quantity for that graph. If filter-text is
specified only those packets that match that display filter
will be considered in the calculation of quantity.</p>

<p>To the right of the 5 graph controls there are four
menus to control global aspects of the draw area and graphs.
The &quot;Unit:&quot; menu is used to control what to
measure; &quot;packets/tick&quot;, &quot;bytes/tick&quot; or
&quot;advanced...&quot;</p>

<p>packets/tick will measure the number of packets matching
the (if specified) display filter for the graph in each
measurement interval.</p>

<p>bytes/tick will measure the total number of bytes in all
packets matching the (if specified) display filter for the
graph in each measurement interval.</p>

<p>advanced... see below</p>

<p>&quot;Tick interval:&quot; specifies what measurement
intervals to use. The default is 1 second and means that the
data will be counted over 1 second intervals.</p>

<p>&quot;Pixels per tick:&quot; specifies how many pixels
wide each measurement interval will be in the drawing area.
The default is 5 pixels per tick.</p>

<p>&quot;Y-scale:&quot; controls the max value for the
y-axis. Default value is &quot;auto&quot; which means that
Wireshark will try to adjust the maxvalue automatically.</p>

<p>&quot;advanced...&quot; If Unit:advanced... is selected
the window will display two more controls for each of the
five graphs. One control will be a menu where the type of
calculation can be selected from SUM,COUNT,MAX,MIN,AVG and
LOAD, and one control, textbox, where the name of a single
display filter field can be specified.</p>

<p>The following restrictions apply to type and field
combinations:</p>

<p>SUM: available for all types of integers and will
calculate the SUM of all occurrences of this field in the
measurement interval. Note that some field can occur
multiple times in the same packet and then all instances
will be summed up. Example: tcp.len which will count the
amount of payload data transferred across TCP in each
interval.</p>

<p>COUNT: available for all field types. This will COUNT
the number of times certain field occurs in each interval.
Note that some fields may occur multiple times in each
packet and if that is the case then each instance will be
counted independently and COUNT will be greater than the
number of packets.</p>

<p>MAX: available for all integer and relative time fields.
This will calculate the max seen integer/time value seen for
the field during the interval. Example: smb.time which will
plot the maximum SMB response time.</p>

<p>MIN: available for all integer and relative time fields.
This will calculate the min seen integer/time value seen for
the field during the interval. Example: smb.time which will
plot the minimum SMB response time.</p>

<p>AVG: available for all integer and relative time
fields.This will calculate the average seen integer/time
value seen for the field during the interval. Example:
smb.time which will plot the average SMB response time.</p>

<p>LOAD: available only for relative time fields (response
times).</p>

<p>Example of advanced: Display how NFS response time
MAX/MIN/AVG changes over time:</p>

<p>Set first graph to:</p>

<p>filter:nfs&amp;&amp;rpc.time Calc:MAX rpc.time</p>

<p>Set second graph to</p>

<p>filter:nfs&amp;&amp;rpc.time Calc:AVG rpc.time</p>

<p>Set third graph to</p>

<p>filter:nfs&amp;&amp;rpc.time Calc:MIN rpc.time</p>

<p>Example of advanced: Display how the average packet size
from host a.b.c.d changes over time.</p>

<p>Set first graph to</p>

<p>filter:ip.addr==a.b.c.d&amp;&amp;frame.pkt_len Calc:AVG
frame.pkt_len</p>

<p>LOAD: The LOAD io-stat type is very different from
anything you have ever seen before! While the response times
themselves as plotted by MIN,MAX,AVG are indications on the
Server load (which affects the Server response time), the
LOAD measurement measures the Client LOAD. What this
measures is how much workload the client generates, i.e. how
fast will the client issue new commands when the previous
ones completed. i.e. the level of concurrency the client can
maintain. The higher the number, the more and faster is the
client issuing new commands. When the LOAD goes down, it may
be due to client load making the client slower in issuing
new commands (there may be other reasons as well, maybe the
client just doesnt have any commands it wants to issue right
then).</p>

<p>Load is measured in concurrency/number of overlapping
i/o and the value 1000 means there is a constant load of one
i/o.</p>

<p>In each tick interval the amount of overlap is measured.
See the graph below containing three commands: Below the
graph are the LOAD values for each interval that would be
calculated.</p>

<p>| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | o=====* | | | |
| | | | | | | | | | | | o========* | o============* | | | |
| | | | | | | |
--------------------------------------------------&gt; Time
500 1500 500 750 1000 500 0 0</p>

<p>Statistics:Conversation List This option will open a new
window that displays a list of all conversations between two
endpoints. The list has one row for each unique conversation
and displays total number of packets/bytes seen as well as
number of packets/bytes in each direction.</p>

<p>By default the list is sorted according to the number of
packets but by clicking on the column header; it is possible
to re-sort the list in ascending or descending order by any
column.</p>

<p>By first selecting a conversation by clicking on it and
then using the right mouse button (on those platforms that
have a right mouse button) wireshark will display a popup
menu offering several different filter operations to apply
to the capture.</p>

<p>These statistics windows can also be invoked from the
Wireshark command line using the -z conv argument.</p>

<p>Statistics:Service Response Time &middot; AFP</p>

<p>&middot; CAMEL</p>

<p>&middot; DCE-RPC</p>

<p>Open a window to display Service Response Time
statistics for an arbitrary DCE-RPC program interface and
display Procedure, Number of Calls, Minimum SRT, Maximum SRT
and Average SRT for all procedures for that program/version.
These windows opened will update in semi-real time to
reflect changes when doing live captures or when reading new
capture files into Wireshark.</p>

<p>This dialog will also allow an optional filter string to
be used. If an optional filter string is used only such
DCE-RPC request/response pairs that match that filter will
be used to calculate the statistics. If no filter string is
specified all request/response pairs will be used.</p>

<p>&middot; Diameter</p>

<p>&middot; Fibre Channel</p>

<p>Open a window to display Service Response Time
statistics for Fibre Channel and display FC Type, Number of
Calls, Minimum SRT, Maximum SRT and Average SRT for all FC
types. These windows opened will update in semi-real time to
reflect changes when doing live captures or when reading new
capture files into Wireshark. The Service Response Time is
calculated as the time delta between the First packet of the
exchange and the Last packet of the exchange.</p>

<p>This dialog will also allow an optional filter string to
be used. If an optional filter string is used only such FC
first/last exchange pairs that match that filter will be
used to calculate the statistics. If no filter string is
specified all request/response pairs will be used.</p>

<p>&middot; GTP</p>

<p>&middot; H.225 RAS</p>

<p>Collect requests/response SRT (Service Response Time)
data for ITU-T H.225 RAS. Data collected is number of calls
for each known ITU-T H.225 RAS Message Type, Minimum SRT,
Maximum SRT, Average SRT, Minimum in Packet, and Maximum in
Packet. You will also get the number of Open Requests
(Unresponded Requests), Discarded Responses (Responses
without matching request) and Duplicate Messages. These
windows opened will update in semi-real time to reflect
changes when doing live captures or when reading new capture
files into Wireshark.</p>

<p>You can apply an optional filter string in a dialog box,
before starting the calculation. The statistics will only be
calculated on those calls matching that filter.</p>

<p>&middot; LDAP</p>

<p>&middot; MEGACO</p>

<p>&middot; MGCP</p>

<p>Collect requests/response SRT (Service Response Time)
data for MGCP. Data collected is number of calls for each
known MGCP Type, Minimum SRT, Maximum SRT, Average SRT,
Minimum in Packet, and Maximum in Packet. These windows
opened will update in semi-real time to reflect changes when
doing live captures or when reading new capture files into
Wireshark.</p>

<p>You can apply an optional filter string in a dialog box,
before starting the calculation. The statistics will only be
calculated on those calls matching that filter.</p>

<p>&middot; NCP</p>

<p>&middot; ONC-RPC</p>

<p>Open a window to display statistics for an arbitrary
ONC-RPC program interface and display Procedure, Number of
Calls, Minimum SRT, Maximum SRT and Average SRT for all
procedures for that program/version. These windows opened
will update in semi-real time to reflect changes when doing
live captures or when reading new capture files into
Wireshark.</p>

<p>This dialog will also allow an optional filter string to
be used. If an optional filter string is used only such
ONC-RPC request/response pairs that match that filter will
be used to calculate the statistics. If no filter string is
specified all request/response pairs will be used.</p>

<p>By first selecting a conversation by clicking on it and
then using the right mouse button (on those platforms that
have a right mouse button) wireshark will display a popup
menu offering several different filter operations to apply
to the capture.</p>

<p>&middot; SMB</p>

<p>Collect call/reply SRT (Service Response Time) data for
SMB. Data collected is the number of calls for each SMB
command, MinSRT, MaxSRT and AvgSRT.</p>

<p>The data will be presented as separate tables for all
normal SMB commands, all Transaction2 commands and all NT
Transaction commands. Only those commands that are seen in
the capture will have its stats displayed. Only the first
command in a xAndX command chain will be used in the
calculation. So for common SessionSetupAndX +
TreeConnectAndX chains, only the SessionSetupAndX call will
be used in the statistics. This is a flaw that might be
fixed in the future.</p>

Wireshark (see &quot;About&quot; dialog below), like the
version, the folders used, the available plugins, ...</p>

<p>WINDOWS Main Window The main window contains the usual
things like the menu, some toolbars, the main area and a
statusbar. The main area is split into three panes, you can
resize each pane using a &quot;thumb&quot; at the right end
of each divider line.</p>

<p>The main window is much more flexible than before. The
layout of the main window can be customized by the Layout
page in the dialog box popped up by Edit:Preferences, the
following will describe the layout with the default
settings.</p>

<p>Main Toolbar Some menu items are available for quick
access here. There is no way to customize the items in the
toolbar, however the toolbar can be hidden by View:Main
Toolbar.</p>

<p>Filter Toolbar A display filter can be entered into the
filter toolbar. A filter for HTTP, HTTPS, and DNS traffic
might look like this:</p>

<p>tcp.port == 80 || tcp.port == 443 || tcp.port == 53</p>

<p>Selecting the Filter: button lets you choose from a list
of named filters that you can optionally save. Pressing the
Return or Enter keys, or selecting the Apply button, will
cause the filter to be applied to the current list of
packets. Selecting the Reset button clears the display
filter so that all packets are displayed (again).</p>

<p>There is no way to customize the items in the toolbar,
however the toolbar can be hidden by View:Filter
Toolbar.</p>

<p>Packet List Pane The top pane contains the list of
network packets that you can scroll through and select. By
default, the packet number, packet timestamp, source and
destination addresses, protocol, and description are
displayed for each packet; the Columns page in the dialog
box popped up by Edit:Preferences lets you change this
(although, unfortunately, you currently have to save the
preferences, and exit and restart Wireshark, for those
changes to take effect).</p>

<p>If you click on the heading for a column, the display
will be sorted by that column; clicking on the heading again
will reverse the sort order for that column.</p>

<p>An effort is made to display information as high up the
protocol stack as possible, e.g. IP addresses are displayed
for IP packets, but the MAC layer address is displayed for
unknown packet types.</p>

<p>The right mouse button can be used to pop up a menu of
operations.</p>

<p>The middle mouse button can be used to mark a
packet.</p>

<p>Packet Details Pane The middle pane contains a display
of the details of the currently-selected packet. The display
shows each field and its value in each protocol header in
the stack. The right mouse button can be used to pop up a
menu of operations.</p>

<p>Packet Bytes Pane The lowest pane contains a hex and
ASCII dump of the actual packet data. Selecting a field in
the packet details highlights the corresponding bytes in
this section.</p>

<p>The right mouse button can be used to pop up a menu of
operations.</p>

<p>Statusbar The statusbar is divided into three parts, on
the left some context dependent things are shown, like
information about the loaded file, in the center the number
of packets are displayed, and on the right the current
configuration profile.</p>

<p>The statusbar can be hidden by View:Statusbar.</p>

<p>Preferences The Preferences dialog lets you control
various personal preferences for the behavior of
Wireshark.</p>

<p>User Interface Preferences The User Interface page is
used to modify small aspects of the GUI to your own personal
taste:</p>

<p>Selection Bars The selection bar in the packet list and
packet details can have either a &quot;browse&quot; or
&quot;select&quot; behavior. If the selection bar has a
&quot;browse&quot; behavior, the arrow keys will move an
outline of the selection bar, allowing you to browse the
rest of the list or details without changing the selection
until you press the space bar. If the selection bar has a
&quot;select&quot; behavior, the arrow keys will move the
selection bar and change the selection to the new item in
the packet list or packet details.</p>

<p>Save Window Position If this item is selected, the
position of the main Wireshark window will be saved when
Wireshark exits, and used when Wireshark is started
again.</p>

<p>Save Window Size If this item is selected, the size of
the main Wireshark window will be saved when Wireshark
exits, and used when Wireshark is started again.</p>

<p>Save Window Maximized state If this item is selected the
maximize state of the main Wireshark window will be saved
when Wireshark exists, and used when Wireshark is started
again.</p>

<p>File Open Dialog Behavior This item allows the user to
select how Wireshark handles the listing of the &quot;File
Open&quot; Dialog when opening trace files. &quot;Remember
Last Directory&quot; causes Wireshark to automatically
position the dialog in the directory of the most recently
opened file, even between launches of Wireshark.
&quot;Always Open in Directory&quot; allows the user to
define a persistent directory that the dialog will always
default to.</p>

<p>Directory Allows the user to specify a persistent File
Open directory. Trailing slashes or backslashes will
automatically be added.</p>

<p>File Open Preview timeout This items allows the user to
define how much time is spend reading the capture file to
present preview data in the File Open dialog.</p>

<p>Open Recent maximum list entries The File menu supports
a recent file list. This items allows the user to specify
how many files are kept track of in this list.</p>

<p>Ask for unsaved capture files When closing a capture
file or Wireshark itself if the file isnt saved yet the user
is presented the option to save the file when this item is
set.</p>

<p>Wrap during find This items determines the behavior when
reaching the beginning or the end of a capture file. When
set the search wraps around and continues, otherwise it
stops.</p>

<p>Settings dialogs show a save button This item determines
if the various dialogs sport an explicit Save button or that
save is implicit in OK / Apply.</p>

<p>Web browser command This entry specifies the command
line to launch a web browser. It is used to access online
content, like the Wiki and user guide. Use %s to place the
request URL in the command line.</p>

<p>Display LEDs in the Expert Infos dialog tab labels This
item determines if LED-like colored images are displayed in
the Expert Infos dialog tab labels.</p>

<p>Layout Preferences The Layout page lets you specify the
general layout of the main window. You can choose from six
different layouts and fill the three panes with the contents
you like.</p>

<p>Scrollbars The vertical scrollbars in the three panes
can be set to be either on the left or the right.</p>

<p>Alternating row colors Hex Display The highlight method
in the hex dump display for the selected protocol item can
be set to use either inverse video, or bold characters.</p>

<p>Toolbar style Filter toolbar placement Custom window
title Column Preferences The Columns page lets you specify
the number, title, and format of each column in the packet
list.</p>

<p>The Column title entry is used to specify the title of
the column displayed at the top of the packet list. The type
of data that the column displays can be specified using the
Column format option menu. The row of buttons on the left
perform the following actions:</p>

<p>New Adds a new column to the list.</p>

<p>Delete Deletes the currently selected list item.</p>

<p>Up / Down Moves the selected list item up or down one
position.</p>

<p>Font Preferences The Font page lets you select the font
to be used for most text.</p>

<p>Color Preferences The Colors page can be used to change
the color of the text displayed in the TCP stream window and
for marked packets. To change a color, simply select an
attribute from the &quot;Set:&quot; menu and use the color
selector to get the desired color. The new text colors are
displayed as a sample text.</p>

<p>Capture Preferences The Capture page lets you specify
various parameters for capturing live packet data; these are
used the first time a capture is started.</p>

<p>The Interface: combo box lets you specify the interface
from which to capture packet data, or the name of a FIFO
from which to get the packet data.</p>

<p>The Data link type: option menu lets you, for some
interfaces, select the data link header you want to see on
the packets you capture. For example, in some OSes and with
some versions of libpcap, you can choose, on an 802.11
interface, whether the packets should appear as Ethernet
packets (with a fake Ethernet header) or as 802.11
packets.</p>

<p>The Limit each packet to ... bytes check box lets you
set the snapshot length to use when capturing live data;
turn on the check box, and then set the number of bytes to
use as the snapshot length.</p>

<p>The Filter: text entry lets you set a capture filter
expression to be used when capturing.</p>

<p>If any of the environment variables SSH_CONNECTION,
SSH_CLIENT, REMOTEHOST, DISPLAY, or SESSIONNAME are set,
Wireshark will create a default capture filter that excludes
traffic from the hosts and ports defined in those
variables.</p>

<p>The Capture packets in promiscuous mode check box lets
you specify whether to put the interface in promiscuous mode
when capturing.</p>

<p>The Update list of packets in real time check box lets
you specify that the display should be updated as packets
are seen.</p>

<p>The Automatic scrolling in live capture check box lets
you specify whether, in an &quot;Update list of packets in
real time&quot; capture, the packet list pane should
automatically scroll to show the most recently captured
packets.</p>

<p>Printing Preferences The radio buttons at the top of the
Printing page allow you choose between printing packets with
the File:Print Packet menu item as text or PostScript, and
sending the output directly to a command or saving it to a
file. The Command: text entry box, on UNIX-compatible
systems, is the command to send files to (usually lpr), and
the File: entry box lets you enter the name of the file you
wish to save to. Additionally, you can select the File:
button to browse the file system for a particular save
file.</p>

<p>Name Resolution Preferences The Enable MAC name
resolution, Enable network name resolution and Enable
transport name resolution check boxes let you specify
whether MAC addresses, network addresses, and
transport-layer port numbers should be translated to
names.</p>

<p>The Enable concurrent DNS name resolution allows
Wireshark to send out multiple name resolution requests and
not wait for the result before continuing dissection. This
speeds up dissection with network name resolution but
initially may miss resolutions. The number of concurrent
requests can be set here as well.</p>

<p>SMI paths</p>

<p>SMI modules</p>

<p>RTP Player Preferences This page allows you to select
the number of channels visible in the RTP player window. It
determines the height of the window, more channels are
possible and visible by means of a scroll bar.</p>

<p>Protocol Preferences There are also pages for various
protocols that Wireshark dissects, controlling the way
Wireshark handles those protocols.</p>

<p>Edit Capture Filter List Edit Display Filter List
Capture Filter Display Filter Read Filter Search Filter The
Edit Capture Filter List dialog lets you create, modify, and
delete capture filters, and the Edit Display Filter List
dialog lets you create, modify, and delete display
filters.</p>

<p>The Capture Filter dialog lets you do all of the editing
operations listed, and also lets you choose or construct a
filter to be used when capturing packets.</p>

<p>The Display Filter dialog lets you do all of the editing
operations listed, and also lets you choose or construct a
filter to be used to filter the current capture being
viewed.</p>

<p>The Read Filter dialog lets you do all of the editing
operations listed, and also lets you choose or construct a
filter to be used to as a read filter for a capture file you
open.</p>

<p>The Search Filter dialog lets you do all of the editing
operations listed, and also lets you choose or construct a
filter expression to be used in a find operation.</p>

<p>In all of those dialogs, the Filter name entry specifies
a descriptive name for a filter, e.g. Web and DNS traffic.
The Filter string entry is the text that actually describes
the filtering action to take, as described above.The dialog
buttons perform the following actions:</p>

<p>New If there is text in the two entry boxes, creates a
new associated list item.</p>

<p>Edit Modifies the currently selected list item to match
whats in the entry boxes.</p>

<p>Delete Deletes the currently selected list item.</p>

<p>Add Expression... For display filter expressions, pops
up a dialog box to allow you to construct a filter
expression to test a particular field; it offers lists of
field names, and, when appropriate, lists from which to
select tests to perform on the field and values with which
to compare it. In that dialog box, the OK button will cause
the filter expression you constructed to be entered into the
Filter string entry at the current cursor position.</p>

<p>OK In the Capture Filter dialog, closes the dialog box
and makes the filter in the Filter string entry the filter
in the Capture Preferences dialog. In the Display Filter
dialog, closes the dialog box and makes the filter in the
Filter string entry the current display filter, and applies
it to the current capture. In the Read Filter dialog, closes
the dialog box and makes the filter in the Filter string
entry the filter in the Open Capture File dialog. In the
Search Filter dialog, closes the dialog box and makes the
filter in the Filter string entry the filter in the Find
Packet dialog.</p>

<p>Apply Makes the filter in the Filter string entry the
current display filter, and applies it to the current
capture.</p>

<p>Save If the list of filters being edited is the list of
capture filters, saves the current filter list to the
personal capture filters file, and if the list of filters
being edited is the list of display filters, saves the
current filter list to the personal display filters
file.</p>

<p>Close Closes the dialog without doing anything with the
filter in the Filter string entry.</p>

<p>The Color Filters Dialog This dialog displays a list of
color filters and allows it to be modified.</p>

<p>THE FILTER LIST Single rows may be selected by clicking.
Multiple rows may be selected by using the ctrl and shift
keys in combination with the mouse button.</p>

<p>NEW Adds a new filter at the bottom of the list and
opens the Edit Color Filter dialog box. You will have to
alter the filter expression at least before the filter will
be accepted. The format of color filter expressions is
identical to that of display filters. The new filter is
selected, so it may immediately be moved up and down,
deleted or edited. To avoid confusion all filters are
unselected before the new filter is created.</p>

<p>EDIT Opens the Edit Color Filter dialog box for the
selected filter. (If this button is disabled you may have
more than one filter selected, making it ambiguous which is
to be edited.)</p>

<p>ENABLE Enables the selected color filter(s).</p>

<p>DISABLE Disables the selected color filter(s).</p>

<p>DELETE Deletes the selected color filter(s).</p>

<p>EXPORT Allows you to choose a file in which to save the
current list of color filters. You may also choose to save
only the selected filters. A button is provided to save the
filters in the global color filters file (you must have
sufficient permissions to write this file, of course).</p>

<p>IMPORT Allows you to choose a file containing color
filters which are then added to the bottom of the current
list. All the added filters are selected, so they may be
moved to the correct position in the list as a group. To
avoid confusion, all filters are unselected before the new
filters are imported. A button is provided to load the
filters from the global color filters file.</p>

<p>CLEAR Deletes your personal color filters file, reloads
the global color filters file, if any, and closes the
dialog.</p>

<p>UP Moves the selected filter(s) up the list, making it
more likely that they will be used to color packets.</p>

<p>DOWN Moves the selected filter(s) down the list, making
it less likely that they will be used to color packets.</p>

<p>OK Closes the dialog and uses the color filters as they
stand.</p>

<p>APPLY Colors the packets according to the current list
of color filters, but does not close the dialog.</p>

<p>SAVE Saves the current list of color filters in your
personal color filters file. Unless you do this they will
not be used the next time you start Wireshark.</p>

<p>CLOSE Closes the dialog without changing the coloration
of the packets. Note that changes you have made to the
current list of color filters are not undone.</p>

<p>Capture Options Dialog The Capture Options Dialog lets
you specify various parameters for capturing live packet
data.</p>

<p>The Interface: field lets you specify the interface from
which to capture packet data or a command from which to get
the packet data via a pipe.</p>

<p>The Link layer header type: field lets you specify the
interfaces link layer header type. This field is usually
disabled, as most interface have only one header type.</p>

<p>The Capture packets in promiscuous mode check box lets
you specify whether the interface should be put into
promiscuous mode when capturing.</p>

<p>The Limit each packet to ... bytes check box and field
lets you specify a maximum number of bytes per packet to
capture and save; if the check box is not checked, the limit
will be 65535 bytes.</p>

<p>The Capture Filter: entry lets you specify the capture
filter using a tcpdump-style filter string as described
above.</p>

<p>The File: entry lets you specify the file into which
captured packets should be saved, as in the Printer Options
dialog above. If not specified, the captured packets will be
saved in a temporary file; you can save those packets to a
file with the File:Save As menu item.</p>

<p>The Use multiple files check box lets you specify that
the capture should be done in &quot;multiple files&quot;
mode. This option is disabled, if the Update list of packets
in real time option is checked.</p>

<p>The Next file every ... megabyte(s) check box and fields
lets you specify that a switch to a next file should be done
if the specified filesize is reached. You can also select
the appropriate unit, but beware that the filesize has a
maximum of 2 GB. The check box is forced to be checked, as
&quot;multiple files&quot; mode requires a file size to be
specified.</p>

<p>The Next file every ... minute(s) check box and fields
lets you specify that the switch to a next file should be
done after the specified time has elapsed, even if the
specified capture size is not reached.</p>

<p>The Ring buffer with ... files field lets you specify
the number of files of a ring buffer. This feature will
capture into to the first file again, after the specified
amount of files were used.</p>

<p>The Stop capture after ... files field lets you specify
the number of capture files used, until the capture is
stopped.</p>

<p>The Stop capture after ... packet(s) check box and field
let you specify that Wireshark should stop capturing after
having captured some number of packets; if the check box is
not checked, Wireshark will not stop capturing at some fixed
number of captured packets.</p>

<p>The Stop capture after ... megabyte(s) check box and
field lets you specify that Wireshark should stop capturing
after the file to which captured packets are being saved
grows as large as or larger than some specified number of
megabytes. If the check box is not checked, Wireshark will
not stop capturing at some capture file size (although the
operating system on which Wireshark is running, or the
available disk space, may still limit the maximum size of a
capture file). This option is disabled, if &quot;multiple
files&quot; mode is used,</p>

<p>The Stop capture after ... second(s) check box and field
let you specify that Wireshark should stop capturing after
it has been capturing for some number of seconds; if the
check box is not checked, Wireshark will not stop capturing
after some fixed time has elapsed.</p>

<p>The Update list of packets in real time check box lets
you specify whether the display should be updated as packets
are captured and, if you specify that, the Automatic
scrolling in live capture check box lets you specify the
packet list pane should automatically scroll to show the
most recently captured packets as new packets arrive.</p>

<p>The Enable MAC name resolution, Enable network name
resolution and Enable transport name resolution check boxes
let you specify whether MAC addresses, network addresses,
and transport-layer port numbers should be translated to
names.</p>

<p>About The About dialog lets you view various information
about Wireshark.</p>

<p>About:Wireshark The Wireshark page lets you view general
information about Wireshark, like the installed version,
licensing information and such.</p>

<p>About:Authors The Authors page shows the author and all
contributors.</p>

<p>About:Folders The Folders page lets you view the
directory names where Wireshark is searching it s various
configuration and other files.</p>

<p>About:Plugins The Plugins page lets you view the
dissector plugin modules available on your system.</p>

<p>The Plugins List shows the name and version of each
dissector plugin module found on your system.</p>

<p>On Unix-compatible systems, the plugins are looked for
in the following directories: the
lib/wireshark/plugins/$VERSION directory under the main
installation directory (for example,
/usr/local/lib/wireshark/plugins/$VERSION), and then
$HOME/.wireshark/plugins.</p>

<p>On Windows systems, the plugins are looked for in the
following directories: plugins$VERSION directory under the
main installation directory (for example, C:Program
FilesWiresharkplugins$VERSION), and then
%APPDATA%Wiresharkplugins$VERSION (or, if %APPDATA% isnt
defined, %USERPROFILE%Application
DataWiresharkplugins$VERSION).</p>

<p>$VERSION is the version number of the plugin interface,
which is typically the version number of Wireshark. Note
that a dissector plugin module may support more than one
protocol; there is not necessarily a one-to-one
correspondence between dissector plugin modules and
protocols. Protocols supported by a dissector plugin module
are enabled and disabled using the Edit:Protocols dialog
box, just as protocols built into Wireshark are.</p>

<p>CAPTURE FILTER SYNTAX See the manual page of
pcap-filter(7) or, if that doesn t exist, tcpdump(8), or, if
that doesnt exist,
&lt;http://wiki.wireshark.org/CaptureFilters&gt;.</p>

<p>DISPLAY FILTER SYNTAX For a complete table of protocol
and protocol fields that are filterable in Wireshark see the
wireshark-filter(4) manual page.</p>

<p>FILES These files contains various Wireshark
configuration settings.</p>

<p>Preferences The preferences files contain global
(system-wide) and personal preference settings. If the
system-wide preference file exists, it is read first,
overriding the default settings. If the personal preferences
file exists, it is read next, overriding any previous
values. Note: If the command line flag -o is used (possibly
more than once), it will in turn override values from the
preferences files.</p>

<p>The preferences settings are in the form prefname:value,
one per line, where prefname is the name of the preference
and value is the value to which it should be set; white
space is allowed between : and value. A preference setting
can be continued on subsequent lines by indenting the
continuation lines with white space. A # character starts a
comment that runs to the end of the line:</p>

<p># Vertical scrollbars should be on right side? # TRUE or
FALSE (case-insensitive). gui.scrollbar_on_right: TRUE</p>

<p>The global preferences file is looked for in the
wireshark directory under the share subdirectory of the main
installation directory (for example,
/usr/local/share/wireshark/preferences) on UNIX-compatible
systems, and in the main installation directory (for
example, C:Program FilesWiresharkpreferences) on Windows
systems.</p>

<p>The personal preferences file is looked for in
$HOME/.wireshark/preferences on UNIX-compatible systems and
%APPDATA%Wiresharkpreferences (or, if %APPDATA% isn t
defined, %USERPROFILE%Application DataWiresharkpreferences)
on Windows systems.</p>

<p>Note: Whenever the preferences are saved by using the
Save button in the Edit:Preferences dialog box, your
personal preferences file will be overwritten with the new
settings, destroying any comments and unknown/obsolete
settings that were in the file.</p>

<p>Recent The recent file contains personal settings
(mostly GUI related) such as the current Wireshark window
size. The file is saved at program exit and read in at
program start automatically. Note: The command line flag -o
may be used to override settings from this file.</p>

<p>The settings in this file have the same format as in the
preferences files, and the same directory as for the
personal preferences file is used.</p>

<p>Note: Whenever Wireshark is closed, your recent file
will be overwritten with the new settings, destroying any
comments and unknown/obsolete settings that were in the
file.</p>

<p>Disabled (Enabled) Protocols The disabled_protos files
contain system-wide and personal lists of protocols that
have been disabled, so that their dissectors are never
called. The files contain protocol names, one per line,
where the protocol name is the same name that would be used
in a display filter for the protocol:</p>

<p>http tcp # a comment</p>

<p>If a protocol is listed in the global disabled_protos
file, it is not displayed in the Analyze:Enabled Protocols
dialog box, and so cannot be enabled by the user.</p>

<p>The global disabled_protos file uses the same directory
as the global preferences file.</p>

<p>The personal disabled_protos file uses the same
directory as the personal preferences file.</p>

<p>Note: Whenever the disabled protocols list is saved by
using the Save button in the Analyze:Enabled Protocols
dialog box, your personal disabled protocols file will be
overwritten with the new settings, destroying any comments
that were in the file.</p>

<p>Name Resolution (hosts) If the personal hosts file
exists, it is used to resolve IPv4 and IPv6 addresses before
any other attempts are made to resolve them. The file has
the standard hosts file syntax; each line contains one IP
address and name, separated by whitespace. The same
directory as for the personal preferences file is used.</p>

<p>Capture filter name resolution is handled by libpcap on
UNIX- compatible systems and WinPCAP on Windows. As such the
Wireshark personal hosts file will not be consulted for
capture filter name resolution.</p>

<p>Name Resolution (ethers) The ethers files are consulted
to correlate 6-byte hardware addresses to names. First the
personal ethers file is tried and if an address is not found
there the global ethers file is tried next.</p>

<p>Each line contains one hardware address and name,
separated by whitespace. The digits of the hardware address
are separated by colons (:), dashes (-) or periods (.). The
same separator character must be used consistently in an
address. The following three lines are valid lines of an
ethers file:</p>

<p>ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff Broadcast c0-00-ff-ff-ff-ff
TR_broadcast 00.00.00.00.00.00 Zero_broadcast</p>

<p>The global ethers file is looked for in the /etc
directory on UNIX- compatible systems, and in the main
installation directory (for example, C:Program
FilesWireshark) on Windows systems.</p>

<p>The personal ethers file is looked for in the same
directory as the personal preferences file.</p>

<p>Capture filter name resolution is handled by libpcap on
UNIX- compatible systems and WinPCAP on Windows. As such the
Wireshark personal ethers file will not be consulted for
capture filter name resolution.</p>

<p>Name Resolution (manuf) The manuf file is used to match
the 3-byte vendor portion of a 6-byte hardware address with
the manufacturers name; it can also contain well-known MAC
addresses and address ranges specified with a netmask. The
format of the file is the same as the ethers files, except
that entries such as:</p>

<p>00:00:0C Cisco</p>

<p>can be provided, with the 3-byte OUI and the name for a
vendor, and entries such as:</p>

<p>00-00-0C-07-AC/40 All-HSRP-routers</p>

<p>can be specified, with a MAC address and a mask
indicating how many bits of the address must match. The
above entry, for example, has 40 significant bits, or 5
bytes, and would match addresses from 00-00-0C-07-AC-00
through 00-00-0C-07-AC-FF. The mask need not be a multiple
of 8.</p>

<p>The manuf file is looked for in the same directory as
the global preferences file.</p>

<p>Name Resolution (ipxnets) The ipxnets files are used to
correlate 4-byte IPX network numbers to names. First the
global ipxnets file is tried and if that address is not
found there the personal one is tried next.</p>

<p>The format is the same as the ethers file, except that
each address is four bytes instead of six. Additionally, the
address can be represented as a single hexadecimal number,
as is more common in the IPX world, rather than four hex
octets. For example, these four lines are valid lines of an
ipxnets file:</p>

<p>C0.A8.2C.00 HR c0-a8-1c-00 CEO 00:00:BE:EF IT_Server1
110f FileServer3</p>

<p>The global ipxnets file is looked for in the /etc
directory on UNIX-compatible systems, and in the main
installation directory (for example, C:Program
FilesWireshark) on Windows systems.</p>

<p>The personal ipxnets file is looked for in the same
directory as the personal preferences file.</p>

<p>Capture Filters The cfilters files contain system-wide
and personal capture filters. Each line contains one filter,
starting with the string displayed in the dialog box in
quotation marks, followed by the filter string itself:</p>

<p>&quot;HTTP&quot; port 80 &quot;DCERPC&quot; port 135</p>

<p>The global cfilters file uses the same directory as the
global preferences file.</p>

<p>The personal cfilters file uses the same directory as
the personal preferences file. It is written through the
Capture:Capture Filters dialog.</p>

<p>If the global cfilters file exists, it is used only if
the personal cfilters file does not exist; global and
personal capture filters are not merged.</p>

<p>Display Filters The dfilters files contain system-wide
and personal display filters. Each line contains one filter,
starting with the string displayed in the dialog box in
quotation marks, followed by the filter string itself:</p>

<p>&quot;HTTP&quot; http &quot;DCERPC&quot; dcerpc</p>

<p>The global dfilters file uses the same directory as the
global preferences file.</p>

<p>The personal dfilters file uses the same directory as
the personal preferences file. It is written through the
Analyze:Display Filters dialog.</p>

<p>If the global dfilters file exists, it is used only if
the personal dfilters file does not exist; global and
personal display filters are not merged.</p>

<p>Color Filters (Coloring Rules) The colorfilters files
contain system-wide and personal color filters. Each line
contains one filter, starting with the string displayed in
the dialog box, followed by the corresponding display
filter. Then the background and foreground colors are
appended:</p>

<p># a comment @tcp@tcp@[59345,58980,65534][0,0,0]
@udp@udp@[28834,57427,65533][0,0,0]</p>

<p>The global colorfilters file uses the same directory as
the global preferences file.</p>

<p>The personal colorfilters file uses the same directory
as the personal preferences file. It is written through the
View:Coloring Rules dialog.</p>

<p>If the global colorfilters file exists, it is used only
if the personal colorfilters file does not exist; global and
personal color filters are not merged.</p>

<p>GTK rc files The gtkrc files contain system-wide and
personal GTK theme settings.</p>

<p>The global gtkrc file uses the same directory as the
global preferences file.</p>

<p>The personal gtkrc file uses the same directory as the
personal preferences file.</p>

<p>Plugins See above in the description of the
About:Plugins page.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES WIRESHARK_DEBUG_EP_NO_CHUNKS
Normally per-packet memory is allocated in large
&quot;chunks.&quot; This behavior doesnt work well with
debugging tools such as Valgrind or ElectricFence. Export
this environment variable to force individual allocations.
Note: disabling chunks also disables canaries (see
below).</p>

<p>WIRESHARK_DEBUG_SE_NO_CHUNKS Normally per-file memory is
allocated in large &quot;chunks.&quot; This behavior doesnt
work well with debugging tools such as Valgrind or
ElectricFence. Export this environment variable to force
individual allocations. Note: disabling chunks also disables
canaries (see below).</p>

<p>WIRESHARK_DEBUG_EP_NO_CANARY Normally per-packet memory
allocations are separated by &quot;canaries&quot; which
allow detection of memory overruns. This comes at the
expense of some extra memory usage. Exporting this
environment variable disables these canaries.</p>

<p>WIRESHARK_DEBUG_SE_USE_CANARY Exporting this environment
variable causes per-file memory allocations to be protected
with &quot;canaries&quot; which allow for detection of
memory overruns. This comes at the expense of significant
extra memory usage.</p>

<p>WIRESHARK_DEBUG_SCRUB_MEMORY If this environment
variable is set, the contents of per-packet and per-file
memory is initialized to 0xBADDCAFE when the memory is
allocated and is reset to 0xDEADBEEF when the memory is
freed. This functionality is useful mainly to developers
looking for bugs in the way memory is handled.</p>

<p>WIRESHARK_RUN_FROM_BUILD_DIRECTORY This environment
variable causes the plugins and other data files to be
loaded from the build directory (where the program was
compiled) rather than from the standard locations. It has no
effect when the program in question is running with root (or
setuid) permissions on *NIX.</p>

<p>WIRESHARK_DATA_DIR This environment variable causes the
various data files to be loaded from a directory other than
the standard locations. It has no effect when the program in
question is running with root (or setuid) permissions on
*NIX.</p>

<p>WIRESHARK_PYTHON_DIR This environment variable points to
an alternate location for Python. It has no effect when the
program in question is running with root (or setuid)
permissions on *NIX.</p>

<p>ERF_RECORDS_TO_CHECK This environment variable controls
the number of ERF records checked when deciding if a file
really is in the ERF format. Setting this environment
variable a number higher than the default (20) would make
false positives less likely.</p>

<p>IPFIX_RECORDS_TO_CHECK This environment variable
controls the number of IPFIX records checked when deciding
if a file really is in the IPFIX format. Setting this
environment variable a number higher than the default (20)
would make false positives less likely.</p>

<p>WIRESHARK_ABORT_ON_DISSECTOR_BUG If this environment
variable is set, Wireshark will call abort(3) when a
dissector bug is encountered. abort(3) will cause the
program to exit abnormally; if you are running Wireshark in
a debugger, it should halt in the debugger and allow
inspection of the process, and, if you are not running it in
a debugger, it will, on some OSes, assuming your environment
is configured correctly, generate a core dump file. This can
be useful to developers attempting to troubleshoot a problem
with a protocol dissector.</p>

<p>WIRESHARK_EP_VERIFY_POINTERS This environment variable,
if set, causes certain uses of pointers to be audited to
ensure they do not point to memory that is deallocated after
each packet has been fully dissected. This can be useful to
developers writing or auditing code.</p>

<p>WIRESHARK_SE_VERIFY_POINTERS This environment variable,
if set, causes certain uses of pointers to be audited to
ensure they do not point to memory that is deallocated after
when a capture file is closed. This can be useful to
developers writing or auditing code.</p>

<p>WIRESHARK_QUIT_AFTER_CAPTURE Cause Wireshark to exit
after the end of the capture session. This doesnt
automatically start a capture; you must still use -k to do
that. You must also specify an autostop condition, e.g. -c
or -a duration:.... This means that you will not be able to
see the results of the capture after it stops; its primarily
useful for testing.</p>

<p>WIRESHARK_ABORT_ON_OUT_OF_MEMORY This environment
variable, if present, causes abort(3) to be called if
certain out-of-memory conditions (which normally result in
an exception and an explanatory error message) are
experienced. This can be useful to developers debugging
out-of-memory conditions.</p>

pcap(3), dumpcap(1), mergecap(1), text2pcap(1),
pcap-filter(7) or tcpdump(8) if it doesnt exist.</p>
