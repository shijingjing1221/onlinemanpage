<p>NAME xsane - scanner frontend for SANE</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS xsane [--version|-v] [--license|-l]
[--device-settings file |-d file] [--viewer|-V] [--save|-s]
[--copy|-c] [--fax|-f] [--mail|-m] [--no- mode-selection|-n]
[--Fixed|-F] [--Resizable|-R] [--print-filenames|-p]
[--force-filename name |-N name] [--display d] [--sync]
[devicename]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION xsane provides a graphical user-interface to
control an image acquisi- tion device such as a flatbed
scanner. It allows previewing and scan- ning individual
images and can be invoked either directly from the com-
mand-line or through The GIMP image manipulation program. In
the for- mer case, xsane acts as a stand-alone program that
saves acquired images in a suitable PNM format (PBM for
black-and-white images, PGM for grayscale images, and PPM
for color images) or converts the image to JPEG, PNG, PS or
TIFF. In the latter case, the images are directly passed to
The GIMP for further processing.</p>

<p>xsane accesses image acquisition devices through the
SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) interface. The list of
available devices depends on installed hardware and
configuration. When invoked without an explicit devicename
argument, xsane presents a dialog listing all known and
available devices. To access an available device that is not
known to the system, the devicename must be specified
explicitly. The format of devicename is
backendname:devicefile (eg: umax:/dev/sga).</p>

<p>RUNNING UNDER THE GIMP To run xsane under the gimp(1),
you should at first make sure that xsane is compiled with
gimp support by entering &quot;xsane -v&quot; on a shell. If
xsane is compiled with gimp support then simply set a
symbolic link from the xsane-binary to one of the gimp(1)
plug-ins directories. For example, for gimp-1.0.x the
command</p>

<p>ln -s /usr/bin/xsane ~/.gimp/plug-ins/</p>

<p>for gimp 1.2.x the command:</p>

<p>ln -s /usr/bin/xsane ~/.gimp-1.2/plug-ins/</p>

<p>and for gimp 2.0.x the command:</p>

<p>ln -s /usr/bin/xsane ~/.gimp-2.0/plug-ins/</p>

<p>adds a symlink for the xsane binary to the users
plug-ins directory. After creating this symlink, xsane will
be queried by gimp(1) the next time it s invoked. From then
on, xsane can be invoked through
&quot;Xtns-&gt;XSane-&gt;Device dialog...&quot; (gimp-1.0.x)
or through &quot;File-&gt;Acquire-&gt;XSane-&gt;Device
dialog...&quot; (gimp-1.2.x and 2.0.x) menu entry.</p>

<p>You ll also find that the &quot;Xtns-&gt;XSane&quot; or
&quot;File-&gt;Acquire-&gt;XSane&quot; menu contains
short-cuts to the SANE devices that were available at the
time the xsane was queried. Note that gimp(1) caches these
short-cuts in ~/.gimp/pluginrc. Thus, when the list of
available devices changes (e.g., a new scanner is installed
or the device of the scanner has changed), then it is
typically desirable to rebuild this cache. To do this, you
can either touch(1) the xsane binary (e.g., &quot;touch
/usr/bin/xsane&quot;) or delete the plugin cache (e.g.,
&quot;rm ~/.gimp/plug- inrc&quot;). Either way, invoking
gimp(1) afterwards will cause the plug- inrc to be
rebuilt.</p>

<p>When xsane is started from the gimp then it is not
possible to add a devicename explicitly. You have to make
the devices known to the system by configuring sane-dll,
sane-net and saned.</p>

<p>OPTIONS If the --version or -v flag is given xsane
prints a version informa- tion, some information about gtk+
and gimp version it is compiled against and lists the
supported fileformats, then it exits.</p>

<p>when the --license or -l flag is igven xsane prints
license information and exits.</p>

<p>The --device-settings or -d flag reads the next option
as default file- name for device settings. The extension
&quot;.drc&quot; must not be included.</p>

<p>The --viewer or -V flag forces xsane to start in viewer
mode.</p>

<p>The --save or -s flag forces xsane to start in save
mode.</p>

<p>The --copy or -c flag forces xsane to start in copy
mode.</p>

<p>The --fax or -f flag forces xsane to start in fax
mode.</p>

<p>The --mail or -m flag forces xsane to start in mail
mode.</p>

<p>The --no-mode-selection or -n flag disables the menu for
xsane mode selection (viwer, save, copy, fax, mail).</p>

<p>If the --Fixed or -F flag is given then xsane uses a
fixed, non resiz- able main window. The flag overwrites the
preferences value.</p>

<p>If the --Resizable or -R flag is given then xsane uses a
scrolled and resizable main window. The flag overwrites the
preferences value.</p>

<p>If --print-filenames or -p flag is given then xsane
prints the names of created files to the standard
output.</p>

<p>When the flag --force-filename or -N is given then xsane
reads the next option as default image filename. The name
should be of the format &quot;name-###.ext&quot;. The
selection box for filenames is disabled. This option
normally should be used with the option --no-mode-selection
and --save.</p>

<p>The --display flag selects the X11 display used to
present the graphi- cal user-interface (see X(1) for
details).</p>

<p>The --sync flag requests a synchronous connection with
the X11 server. This is for debugging purposes only.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT SANE_DEFAULT_DEVICE is used to preselect the
device in the device dialog. This way you only have to
accept the device (&lt;ENTER&gt; or OK-Button).</p>

<p>FILES $HOME/.sane/xsane/xsane.rc This files holds the
user preferences. Normally, this file should not be
manipulated directly. Instead, the user should customize the
program through the &quot;Preferences&quot; menu.</p>

<p>$HOME/.sane/xsane/devicename.rc For each device, there
is one rc-file that holds the saved set- tings for that
particular device. Normally, this file should not be
manipulated directly. Instead, the user should use the xsane
interface to select appropriate values and then save the
device settings using the &quot;Preferences-&gt;Save Device
Settings&quot; menubar entry.</p>

<p>/usr/share/sane/xsane/xsane-style.rc This system-wide
file controls the aspects of the user-interface such as
colors and fonts. It is a GTK style file and provides fine
control over the visual aspects of the user-interface.</p>

<p>$HOME/.sane/xsane/xsane-style.rc This file serves the
same purpose as the system-wide style file. If present, it
takes precedence over the system wide style file.</p>
