<p>FTIME(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual FTIME(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME ftime - get date and time (LEGACY)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/timeb.h&gt;</p>

<p>int ftime(struct timeb *tp);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The ftime() function shall set the time and
millitm members of the timeb structure pointed to by tp to
contain the seconds and millisec- onds portions,
respectively, of the current time in seconds since the
Epoch. The contents of the timezone and dstflag members of
tp after a call to ftime() are unspecified.</p>

<p>The system clock need not have millisecond granularity.
Depending on any granularity (particularly a granularity of
one) renders code non- portable.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, the ftime()
function shall return 0; other- wise, -1 shall be
returned.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Getting the Current Time and Date The following
example shows how to get the current system time values
using the ftime() function. The timeb structure pointed to
by tp is filled with the current system time values for time
and millitm.</p>

<p>#include &lt;sys/timeb.h&gt;</p>

<p>struct timeb tp; int status; ... status =
ftime(&amp;tp);</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE For applications portability, the
time() function should be used to determine the current time
instead of ftime(). Realtime applications should use
clock_gettime() to determine the current time instead of
ftime().</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS This function may be withdrawn in a
future version.</p>
