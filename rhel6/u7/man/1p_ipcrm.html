<p>IPCRM(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual IPCRM(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME ipcrm - remove an XSI message queue, semaphore set,
or shared memory segment identifier</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ipcrm [ -q msgid | -Q msgkey | -s semid | -S
semkey | -m shmid | -M shmkey ] ...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The ipcrm utility shall remove zero or more
message queues, semaphore sets, or shared memory segments.
The interprocess communication facili- ties to be removed
are specified by the options.</p>

<p>Only a user with appropriate privilege shall be allowed
to remove an interprocess communication facility that was
not created by or owned by the user invoking ipcrm.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The ipcrm facility supports the Base Definitions
volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax
Guidelines.</p>

<p>The following options shall be supported:</p>

<p>-q msgid Remove the message queue identifier msgid from
the system and destroy the message queue and data structure
associated with it.</p>

<p>-m shmid Remove the shared memory identifier shmid from
the system. The shared memory segment and data structure
associated with it shall be destroyed after the last
detach.</p>

<p>-s semid Remove the semaphore identifier semid from the
system and destroy the set of semaphores and data structure
associated with it.</p>

<p>-Q msgkey Remove the message queue identifier, created
with key msgkey, from the system and destroy the message
queue and data structure associated with it.</p>

<p>-M shmkey Remove the shared memory identifier, created
with key shmkey, from the system. The shared memory segment
and data structure associated with it shall be destroyed
after the last detach.</p>

<p>-S semkey Remove the semaphore identifier, created with
key semkey, from the system and destroy the set of
semaphores and data structure associated with it.</p>

<p>OPERANDS None.</p>

<p>STDIN Not used.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of ipcrm:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in
arguments).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT Not used.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 Successful completion.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
