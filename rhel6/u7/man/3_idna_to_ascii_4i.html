<p>NAME idna_to_ascii_4i - API function</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;idna.h&gt;</p>

<p>int idna_to_ascii_4i(const uint32_t * in, size_t inlen,
char * out, int flags);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS const uint32_t * in input array with unicode
code points.</p>

<p>size_t inlen length of input array with unicode code
points.</p>

<p>char * out output zero terminated string that must have
room for at least 63 characters plus the terminating
zero.</p>

<p>int flags an Idna_flags value, e.g.,
IDNA_ALLOW_UNASSIGNED or IDNA_USE_STD3_ASCII_RULES.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The ToASCII operation takes a sequence of
Unicode code points that make up one domain label and
transforms it into a sequence of code points in the ASCII
range (0..7F). If ToASCII succeeds, the original sequence
and the resulting sequence are equivalent labels.</p>

<p>It is important to note that the ToASCII operation can
fail. ToASCII fails if any step of it fails. If any step of
the ToASCII operation fails on any label in a domain name,
that domain name MUST NOT be used as an internationalized
domain name. The method for deadling with this failure is
application-specific.</p>

<p>The inputs to ToASCII are a sequence of code points, the
AllowUnas- signed flag, and the UseSTD3ASCIIRules flag. The
output of ToASCII is either a sequence of ASCII code points
or a failure condition.</p>

<p>ToASCII never alters a sequence of code points that are
all in the ASCII range to begin with (although it could
fail). Applying the ToASCII operation multiple times has
exactly the same effect as apply- ing it just once.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Returns 0 on success, or an Idna_rc error
code.</p>
