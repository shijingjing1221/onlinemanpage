<p>FPATHCONF(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
FPATHCONF(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME fpathconf, pathconf - get configurable pathname
variables</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>long fpathconf(int fildes, int name); long
pathconf(const char *path, int name);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The fpathconf() and pathconf() functions
shall determine the current value of a configurable limit or
option (variable) that is associated with a file or
directory.</p>

<p>For pathconf(), the path argument points to the pathname
of a file or directory.</p>

<p>For fpathconf(), the fildes argument is an open file
descriptor.</p>

<p>The name argument represents the variable to be queried
relative to that file or directory. Implementations shall
support all of the vari- ables listed in the following table
and may support others. The vari- ables in the following
table come from &lt;limits.h&gt; or &lt;unistd.h&gt; and the
symbolic constants, defined in &lt;unistd.h&gt;, are the
corresponding values used for name.</p>

<p>Requirements 1. If path or fildes refers to a directory,
the value returned shall apply to the directory itself.</p>

<p>2. If path or fildes does not refer to a terminal file,
it is unspeci- fied whether an implementation supports an
association of the vari- able name with the specified
file.</p>

<p>3. If path or fildes refers to a directory, the value
returned shall apply to filenames within the directory.</p>

<p>4. If path or fildes does not refer to a directory, it
is unspecified whether an implementation supports an
association of the variable name with the specified
file.</p>

<p>5. If path or fildes refers to a directory, the value
returned shall be the maximum length of a relative pathname
when the specified directory is the working directory.</p>

<p>6. If path refers to a FIFO, or fildes refers to a pipe
or FIFO, the value returned shall apply to the referenced
object. If path or fildes refers to a directory, the value
returned shall apply to any FIFO that exists or can be
created within the directory. If path or fildes refers to
any other type of file, it is unspecified whether an
implementation supports an association of the variable name
with the specified file.</p>

<p>7. If path or fildes refers to a directory, the value
returned shall apply to any files, other than directories,
that exist or can be created within the directory.</p>

<p>8. If path or fildes refers to a directory, it is
unspecified whether an implementation supports an
association of the variable name with the specified
file.</p>

<p>9. If path or fildes refers to a directory, the value
returned shall be the maximum length of the string that a
symbolic link in that directory can contain.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE If name is an invalid value, both
pathconf() and fpathconf() shall return -1 and set errno to
indicate the error.</p>

<p>If the variable corresponding to name has no limit for
the path or file descriptor, both pathconf() and fpathconf()
shall return -1 without changing errno. If the
implementation needs to use path to determine the value of
name and the implementation does not support the associa-
tion of name with the file specified by path, or if the
process did not have appropriate privileges to query the
file specified by path, or path does not exist, pathconf()
shall return -1 and set errno to indi- cate the error.</p>

<p>If the implementation needs to use fildes to determine
the value of name and the implementation does not support
the association of name with the file specified by fildes,
or if fildes is an invalid file descriptor, fpathconf()
shall return -1 and set errno to indicate the error.</p>

<p>Otherwise, pathconf() or fpathconf() shall return the
current variable value for the file or directory without
changing errno. The value returned shall not be more
restrictive than the corresponding value available to the
application when it was compiled with the implementa- tions
&lt;limits.h&gt; or &lt;unistd.h&gt;.</p>

<p>ERRORS The pathconf() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The value of name is not valid.</p>

<p>ELOOP A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during
resolution of the path argument.</p>

<p>The pathconf() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EACCES Search permission is denied for a component of
the path prefix.</p>

<p>EINVAL The implementation does not support an
association of the vari- able name with the specified
file.</p>

<p>ELOOP More than {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic links were
encountered during resolution of the path argument.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG The length of the path argument exceeds
{PATH_MAX} or a pathname component is longer than
{NAME_MAX}.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG As a result of encountering a symbolic link
in resolution of the path argument, the length of the
substituted pathname string exceeded {PATH_MAX}.</p>

<p>ENOENT A component of path does not name an existing
file or path is an empty string.</p>

<p>ENOTDIR A component of the path prefix is not a
directory.</p>

<p>The fpathconf() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The value of name is not valid.</p>

<p>The fpathconf() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EBADF The fildes argument is not a valid file
descriptor.</p>

<p>EINVAL The implementation does not support an
association of the vari- able name with the specified
file.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The pathconf() function was proposed
immediately after the sysconf() function when it was
realized that some configurable values may differ across
file system, directory, or device boundaries.</p>

<p>For example, {NAME_MAX} frequently changes between
System V and BSD- based file systems; System V uses a
maximum of 14, BSD 255. On an implementation that provides
both types of file systems, an application would be forced
to limit all pathname components to 14 bytes, as this would
be the value specified in &lt;limits.h&gt; on such a
system.</p>

<p>Therefore, various useful values can be queried on any
pathname or file descriptor, assuming that the appropriate
permissions are in place.</p>

<p>The value returned for the variable {PATH_MAX} indicates
the longest relative pathname that could be given if the
specified directory is the process current working
directory. A process may not always be able to generate a
name that long and use it if a subdirectory in the pathname
crosses into a more restrictive file system.</p>

<p>The value returned for the variable
_POSIX_CHOWN_RESTRICTED also applies to directories that do
not have file systems mounted on them. The value may change
when crossing a mount point, so applications that need to
know should check for each directory. (An even easier check
is to try the chown() function and look for an error in case
it happens.)</p>

<p>Unlike the values returned by sysconf(), the
pathname-oriented vari- ables are potentially more volatile
and are not guaranteed to remain constant throughout the
process lifetime. For example, in between two calls to
pathconf(), the file system in question may have been
unmounted and remounted with different characteristics.</p>

<p>Also note that most of the errors are optional. If one
of the variables always has the same value on an
implementation, the implementation need not look at path or
fildes to return that value and is, therefore, not required
to detect any of the errors except the meaning of [EINVAL]
that indicates that the value of name is not valid for that
variable.</p>

<p>If the value of any of the limits is unspecified
(logically infinite), they will not be defined in
&lt;limits.h&gt; and the pathconf() and fpath- conf()
functions return -1 without changing errno. This can be
distin- guished from the case of giving an unrecognized name
argument because errno is set to [EINVAL] in this case.</p>

<p>Since -1 is a valid return value for the pathconf() and
fpathconf() functions, applications should set errno to zero
before calling them and check errno only if the return value
is -1.</p>

<p>For the case of {SYMLINK_MAX}, since both pathconf() and
open() follow symbolic links, there is no way that path or
fildes could refer to a symbolic link.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
