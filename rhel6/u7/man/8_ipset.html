<p>ipset -</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION ipset is used to set up, maintain and
inspect so called IP sets in the Linux kernel. Depending on
the type of the set, an IP set may store IP(v4/v6)
addresses, (TCP/UDP) port numbers, IP and MAC address pairs,
IP address and port number pairs, etc. See the set type
definitions below.</p>

<p>Iptables matches and targets referring to sets create
references, which protect the given sets in the kernel. A
set cannot be destroyed while there is a single reference
pointing to it.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The options that are recognized by ipset can be
divided into several different groups.</p>

<p>COMMANDS These options specify the desired action to
perform. Only one of them can be specified on the command
line unless otherwise specified below. For all the long
versions of the command names, you need to use only enough
letters to ensure that ipset can differentiate it from all
other commands. The ipset parser follows the order here when
looking for the shortest match in the long command
names.</p>

<p>n, create SETNAME TYPENAME [ CREATE-OPTIONS ] Create a
set identified with setname and specified type. The type may
require type specific options. If the -exist option is
specified, ipset ignores the error otherwise raised when the
same set (setname and create parameters are identical)
already exists.</p>

<p>add SETNAME ADD-ENTRY [ ADD-OPTIONS ] Add a given entry
to the set. If the -exist option is specified, ipset ignores
if the entry already added to the set.</p>

<p>del SETNAME DEL-ENTRY [ DEL-OPTIONS ] Delete an entry
from a set. If the -exist option is specified, ipset ignores
if the entry does not added to (already expired from) the
set.</p>

<p>test SETNAME TEST-ENTRY [ TEST-OPTIONS ] Test wether an
entry is in a set or not. Exit status number is zero if the
tested entry is in the set and nonzero if it is missing from
the set.</p>

<p>x, destroy [ SETNAME ] Destroy the specified set or all
the sets if none is given.</p>

<p>If the set has got reference(s), nothing is done and no
set destroyed.</p>

<p>list [ SETNAME ] [ OPTIONS ] List the header data and
the entries for the specified set, or for all sets if none
is given. The -resolve option can be used to force name
lookups (which may be slow). When the -sorted option is
given, the entries are listed sorted (if the given set type
supports the operation). The option -output can be used to
control the format of the listing: plain, save or xml. (The
default is plain.) If the option -name is specified, just
the names of the existing sets are listed. If the option
-terse is specified, just the set names and headers are
listed.</p>

<p>save [ SETNAME ] Save the given set, or all sets if none
is given to stdout in a format that restore can read.</p>

<p>restore Restore a saved session generated by save. The
saved session can be fed from stdin.</p>

<p>flush [ SETNAME ] Flush all entries from the specified
set or flush all sets if none is given.</p>

<p>e, rename SETNAME-FROM SETNAME-TO Rename a set. Set
identified by SETNAME-TO must not exist.</p>

<p>w, swap SETNAME-FROM SETNAME-TO Swap the content of two
sets, or in another words, exchange the name of two sets.
The referred sets must exist and identical type of sets can
be swapped only.</p>

<p>help [ TYPENAME ] Print help and set type specific help
if TYPENAME is specified.</p>

<p>version Print program version.</p>

<p>- If a dash is specified as command, then ipset enters a
simple interactive mode and the commands are read from the
standard input. The interactive mode can be finished by
entering the pseudo-command quit.</p>

<p>OTHER OPTIONS The following additional options can be
specified. The long option names cannot be abbreviated.</p>

<p>-!, -exist Ignore errors when the exactly the same set
is to be created or already added entry is added or missing
entry is deleted.</p>

<p>-o, -output { plain | save | xml } Select the output
format to the list command.</p>

<p>-q, -quiet Suppress any output to stdout and stderr.
ipset will still exit with error if it cannot continue.</p>

<p>-r, -resolve When listing sets, enforce name lookup. The
program will try to display the IP entries resolved to host
names which requires slow DNS lookups.</p>

<p>-s, -sorted Sorted output. When listing sets entries are
listed sorted. Not supported yet.</p>

<p>-n, -name List just the names of the existing sets, i.e.
suppress listing of set headers and members.</p>

<p>-t, -terse List the set names and headers, i.e. suppress
listing of set members.</p>

<p>SET TYPES A set type comprises of the storage method by
which the data is stored and the data type(s) which are
stored in the set. Therefore the TYPE- NAME parameter of the
create command follows the syntax</p>

<p>TYPENAME := method:datatype[,datatype[,datatype]]</p>

<p>where the current list of the methods are bitmap, hash,
and list and the possible data types are ip, net, mac, port
and iface. The dimen- sion of a set is equal to the number
of data types in its type name.</p>

<p>When adding, deleting or testing entries in a set, the
same comma sepa- rated data syntax must be used for the
entry parameter of the commands, i.e</p>

<p>ipset add foo ipaddr,portnum,ipaddr</p>

<p>The bitmap and list types use a fixed sized storage. The
hash types use a hash to store the elements. In order to
avoid clashes in the hash, a limited number of chaining, and
if that is exhausted, the doubling of the hash size is
performed when adding entries by the ipset command. When
entries added by the SET target of iptables/ip6tables, then
the hash size is fixed and the set won t be duplicated, even
if the new entry cannot be added to the set.</p>

<p>All set types support the optional</p>

<p>timeout value</p>

<p>parameter when creating a set and adding entries. The
value of the timeout parameter for the create command means
the default timeout value (in seconds) for new entries. If a
set is created with timeout support, then the same timeout
option can be used to specify non-default timeout values
when adding entries. Zero timeout value means the entry is
added permanent to the set. The timeout value of already
added elements can be changed by readding the element using
the -exist option.</p>

<p>The hash set types which can store net type of data
(i.e. hash:*net*) support the optional</p>

<p>nomatch</p>

<p>option when adding entries. When matching elements in
the set, entries marked as nomatch are skipped as if those
were no added to the set, which makes possible to build up
sets with exceptions. See the example at hash type hash:net
below.</p>

<p>If host names or service names with dash in the name are
used instead of IP addresses or service numbers, then the
host name or service name must be enclosed in square
brackets. Example:</p>

<p>ipset add foo [test-hostname],[ftp-data]</p>

<p>bitmap:ip The bitmap:ip set type uses a memory range to
store either IPv4 host (default) or IPv4 network addresses.
A bitmap:ip type of set can store up to 65536 entries.</p>

<p>CREATE-OPTIONS := range fromip-toip|ip/cidr [ netmask
cidr ] [ timeout value ]</p>

<p>ADD-ENTRY := { ip | fromip-toip | ip/cidr }</p>

<p>ADD-OPTIONS := [ timeout value ]</p>

<p>DEL-ENTRY := { ip | fromip-toip | ip/cidr }</p>

<p>TEST-ENTRY := ip</p>

<p>Mandatory create options:</p>

<p>range fromip-toip|ip/cidr Create the set from the
specified inclusive address range expressed in an IPv4
address range or network. The size of the range (in entries)
cannot exceed the limit of maximum 65536 ele- ments.</p>

<p>Optional create options:</p>

<p>netmask cidr When the optional netmask parameter
specified, network addresses will be stored in the set
instead of IP host addresses. The cidr prefix value must be
between 1-32. An IP address will be in the set if the
network address, which is resulted by masking the address
with the specified netmask calculated from the prefix, can
be found in the set.</p>

<p>The bitmap:ip type supports adding or deleting multiple
entries in one command.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<p>ipset create foo bitmap:ip range 192.168.0.0/16</p>

<p>ipset add foo 192.168.1/24</p>

<p>ipset test foo 192.168.1.1</p>

<p>bitmap:ip,mac The bitmap:ip,mac set type uses a memory
range to store IPv4 and a MAC address pairs. A bitmap:ip,mac
type of set can store up to 65536 entries.</p>

<p>CREATE-OPTIONS := range fromip-toip|ip/cidr [ timeout
value ]</p>

<p>ADD-ENTRY := ip[,macaddr]</p>

<p>ADD-OPTIONS := [ timeout value ]</p>

<p>DEL-ENTRY := ip[,macaddr]</p>

<p>TEST-ENTRY := ip[,macaddr]</p>

<p>Mandatory options to use when creating a bitmap:ip,mac
type of set:</p>

<p>range fromip-toip|ip/cidr Create the set from the
specified inclusive address range expressed in an IPv4
address range or network. The size of the range cannot
exceed the limit of maximum 65536 entries.</p>

<p>The bitmap:ip,mac type is exceptional in the sense that
the MAC part can be left out when adding/deleting/testing
entries in the set. If we add an entry without the MAC
address specified, then when the first time the entry is
matched by the kernel, it will automatically fill out the
missing MAC address with the source MAC address from the
packet. If the entry was specified with a timeout value, the
timer starts off when the IP and MAC address pair is
complete.</p>

<p>The bitmap:ip,mac type of sets require two src/dst
parameters of the set match and SET target netfilter kernel
modules and the second one must be src to match, add or
delete entries because the set match and SET target have
access to the source MAC address only.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<p>ipset create foo bitmap:ip,mac range 192.168.0.0/16</p>

<p>ipset add foo 192.168.1.1,12:34:56:78:9A:BC</p>

<p>ipset test foo 192.168.1.1</p>

<p>bitmap:port The bitmap:port set type uses a memory range
to store port numbers and such a set can store up to 65536
ports.</p>

<p>CREATE-OPTIONS := range fromport-toport [ timeout value
]</p>

<p>ADD-ENTRY := { port | fromport-toport }</p>

<p>ADD-OPTIONS := [ timeout value ]</p>

<p>DEL-ENTRY := { port | fromport-toport }</p>

<p>TEST-ENTRY := port</p>

<p>Mandatory options to use when creating a bitmap:port
type of set:</p>

<p>range fromport-toport Create the set from the specified
inclusive port range.</p>

<p>The set match and SET target netfilter kernel modules
interpret the stored numbers as TCP or UDP port numbers.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<p>ipset create foo bitmap:port range 0-1024</p>

<p>ipset add foo 80</p>

<p>ipset test foo 80</p>

<p>hash:ip The hash:ip set type uses a hash to store IP
host addresses (default) or network addresses. Zero valued
IP address cannot be stored in a hash:ip type of set.</p>

<p>CREATE-OPTIONS := [ family { inet | inet6 } ] | [
hashsize value ] [ maxelem value ] [ netmask cidr ] [
timeout value ]</p>

<p>ADD-ENTRY := ipaddr</p>

<p>ADD-OPTIONS := [ timeout value ]</p>

<p>DEL-ENTRY := ipaddr</p>

<p>TEST-ENTRY := ipaddr</p>

<p>Optional create options:</p>

<p>family { inet | inet6 } The protocol family of the IP
addresses to be stored in the set. The default is inet, i.e
IPv4.</p>

<p>hashsize value The initial hash size for the set,
default is 1024. The hash size must be a power of two, the
kernel automatically rounds up non power of two hash sizes
to the first correct value.</p>

<p>maxelem value The maximal number of elements which can
be stored in the set, default 65536.</p>

<p>netmask cidr When the optional netmask parameter
specified, network addresses will be stored in the set
instead of IP host addresses. The cidr prefix value must be
between 1-32 for IPv4 and between 1-128 for IPv6. An IP
address will be in the set if the network address, which is
resulted by masking the address with the netmask calcu-
lated from the prefix, can be found in the set.</p>

<p>For the inet family one can add or delete multiple
entries by specify- ing a range or a network:</p>

<p>ipaddr := { ip | fromaddr-toaddr | ip/cidr }</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<p>ipset create foo hash:ip netmask 30</p>

<p>ipset add foo 192.168.1.0/24</p>

<p>ipset test foo 192.168.1.2</p>

<p>hash:net The hash:net set type uses a hash to store
different sized IP network addresses. Network address with
zero prefix size cannot be stored in this type of sets.</p>

<p>CREATE-OPTIONS := [ family { inet | inet6 } ] | [
hashsize value ] [ maxelem value ] [ timeout value ]</p>

<p>ADD-ENTRY := netaddr</p>

<p>ADD-OPTIONS := [ timeout value ] [ nomatch ]</p>

<p>DEL-ENTRY := netaddr</p>

<p>TEST-ENTRY := netaddr</p>

<p>where netaddr := ip[/cidr]</p>

<p>Optional create options:</p>

<p>family { inet | inet6 } The protocol family of the IP
addresses to be stored in the set. The default is inet, i.e
IPv4.</p>

<p>hashsize value The initial hash size for the set,
default is 1024. The hash size must be a power of two, the
kernel automatically rounds up non power of two hash sizes
to the first correct value.</p>

<p>maxelem value The maximal number of elements which can
be stored in the set, default 65536.</p>

<p>For the inet family one can add or delete multiple
entries by specify- ing a range, which is converted
internally to network(s) equal to the range:</p>

<p>netaddr := { ip[/cidr] | fromaddr-toaddr }</p>

<p>When adding/deleting/testing entries, if the cidr prefix
parameter is not specified, then the host prefix value is
assumed. When adding/deleting entries, the exact element is
added/deleted and over- lapping elements are not checked by
the kernel. When testing entries, if a host address is
tested, then the kernel tries to match the host address in
the networks added to the set and reports the result accord-
ingly.</p>

<p>From the set netfilter match point of view the searching
for a match always starts from the smallest size of netblock
(most specific prefix) to the largest one (least specific
prefix) added to the set. When adding/deleting IP addresses
to the set by the SET netfilter target, it will be
added/deleted by the most specific prefix which can be found
in the set, or by the host prefix value if the set is
empty.</p>

<p>The lookup time grows linearly with the number of the
different prefix values added to the set.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>ipset create foo hash:net</p>

<p>ipset add foo 192.168.0.0/24</p>

<p>ipset add foo 10.1.0.0/16</p>

<p>ipset add foo 192.168.0/24</p>

<p>ipset add foo 192.168.0/30 nomatch</p>

<p>When matching the elements in the set above, all IP
addresses will match from the networks 192.168.0.0/24,
10.1.0.0/16 and 192.168.0/24 except 192.168.0/30.</p>

<p>hash:ip,port The hash:ip,port set type uses a hash to
store IP address and port num- ber pairs. The port number is
interpreted together with a protocol (default TCP) and zero
protocol number cannot be used.</p>

<p>CREATE-OPTIONS := [ family { inet | inet6 } ] | [
hashsize value ] [ maxelem value ] [ timeout value ]</p>

<p>ADD-ENTRY := ipaddr,[proto:]port</p>

<p>ADD-OPTIONS := [ timeout value ]</p>

<p>DEL-ENTRY := ipaddr,[proto:]port</p>

<p>TEST-ENTRY := ipaddr,[proto:]port</p>

<p>Optional create options:</p>

<p>family { inet | inet6 } The protocol family of the IP
addresses to be stored in the set. The default is inet, i.e
IPv4.</p>

<p>hashsize value The initial hash size for the set,
default is 1024. The hash size must be a power of two, the
kernel automatically rounds up non power of two hash sizes
to the first correct value</p>

<p>maxelem value The maximal number of elements which can
be stored in the set, default 65536.</p>

<p>For the inet family one can add or delete multiple
entries by specify- ing a range or a network of IPv4
addresses in the IP address part of the entry:</p>

<p>ipaddr := { ip | fromaddr-toaddr | ip/cidr }</p>

<p>The [proto:]port part of the elements may be expressed
in the following forms, where the range variations are valid
when adding or deleting entries:</p>

<p>portname[-portname] TCP port or range of ports expressed
in TCP portname identifiers from /etc/services</p>

<p>portnumber[-portnumber] TCP port or range of ports
expressed in TCP port numbers</p>


<p>tcp|sctp|udp|udplite:portname|portnumber[-portname|portnumber]
TCP, SCTP, UDP or UDPLITE port or port range expressed in
port name(s) or port number(s)</p>

<p>icmp:codename|type/code ICMP codename or type/code. The
supported ICMP codename identi- fiers can always be listed
by the help command.</p>

<p>icmpv6:codename|type/code ICMPv6 codename or type/code.
The supported ICMPv6 codename identifiers can always be
listed by the help command.</p>

<p>proto:0 All other protocols, as an identifier from
/etc/protocols or number. The pseudo port number must be
zero.</p>

<p>The hash:ip,port type of sets require two src/dst
parameters of the set match and SET target kernel
modules.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<p>ipset create foo hash:ip,port</p>

<p>ipset add foo 192.168.1.0/24,80-82</p>

<p>ipset add foo 192.168.1.1,udp:53</p>

<p>ipset add foo 192.168.1.1,vrrp:0</p>

<p>ipset test foo 192.168.1.1,80</p>

<p>hash:net,port The hash:net,port set type uses a hash to
store different sized IP net- work address and port pairs.
The port number is interpreted together with a protocol
(default TCP) and zero protocol number cannot be used.
Network address with zero prefix size is not accepted
either.</p>

<p>CREATE-OPTIONS := [ family { inet | inet6 } ] | [
hashsize value ] [ maxelem value ] [ timeout value ]</p>

<p>ADD-ENTRY := netaddr,[proto:]port</p>

<p>ADD-OPTIONS := [ timeout value ] [ nomatch ]</p>

<p>DEL-ENTRY := netaddr,[proto:]port</p>

<p>TEST-ENTRY := netaddr,[proto:]port</p>

<p>where netaddr := ip[/cidr]</p>

<p>Optional create options:</p>

<p>family { inet | inet6 } The protocol family of the IP
addresses to be stored in the set. The default is inet, i.e
IPv4.</p>

<p>hashsize value The initial hash size for the set,
default is 1024. The hash size must be a power of two, the
kernel automatically rounds up non power of two hash sizes
to the first correct value.</p>

<p>maxelem value The maximal number of elements which can
be stored in the set, default 65536.</p>

<p>For the netaddr part of the elements see the description
at the hash:net set type. For the [proto:]port part of the
elements see the description at the hash:ip,port set
type.</p>

<p>When adding/deleting/testing entries, if the cidr prefix
parameter is not specified, then the host prefix value is
assumed. When adding/deleting entries, the exact element is
added/deleted and over- lapping elements are not checked by
the kernel. When testing entries, if a host address is
tested, then the kernel tries to match the host address in
the networks added to the set and reports the result accord-
ingly.</p>

<p>From the set netfilter match point of view the searching
for a match always starts from the smallest size of netblock
(most specific prefix) to the largest one (least specific
prefix) added to the set. When adding/deleting IP addresses
to the set by the SET netfilter target, it will be
added/deleted by the most specific prefix which can be found
in the set, or by the host prefix value if the set is
empty.</p>

<p>The lookup time grows linearly with the number of the
different prefix values added to the set.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<p>ipset create foo hash:net,port</p>

<p>ipset add foo 192.168.0/24,25</p>

<p>ipset add foo 10.1.0.0/16,80</p>

<p>ipset test foo 192.168.0/24,25</p>

<p>hash:ip,port,ip The hash:ip,port,ip set type uses a hash
to store IP address, port num- ber and a second IP address
triples. The port number is interpreted together with a
protocol (default TCP) and zero protocol number cannot be
used.</p>

<p>CREATE-OPTIONS := [ family { inet | inet6 } ] | [
hashsize value ] [ maxelem value ] [ timeout value ]</p>

<p>ADD-ENTRY := ipaddr,[proto:]port,ip</p>

<p>ADD-OPTIONS := [ timeout value ]</p>

<p>DEL-ENTRY := ipaddr,[proto:]port,ip</p>

<p>TEST-ENTRY := ipaddr,[proto:]port,ip</p>

<p>For the first ipaddr and [proto:]port parts of the
elements see the descriptions at the hash:ip,port set
type.</p>

<p>Optional create options:</p>

<p>family { inet | inet6 } The protocol family of the IP
addresses to be stored in the set. The default is inet, i.e
IPv4.</p>

<p>hashsize value The initial hash size for the set,
default is 1024. The hash size must be a power of two, the
kernel automatically rounds up non power of two hash sizes
to the first correct value.</p>

<p>maxelem value The maximal number of elements which can
be stored in the set, default 65536.</p>

<p>The hash:ip,port,ip type of sets require three src/dst
parameters of the set match and SET target kernel
modules.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<p>ipset create foo hash:ip,port,ip</p>

<p>ipset add foo 192.168.1.1,80,10.0.0.1</p>

<p>ipset test foo 192.168.1.1,udp:53,10.0.0.1</p>

<p>hash:ip,port,net The hash:ip,port,net set type uses a
hash to store IP address, port number and IP network address
triples. The port number is interpreted together with a
protocol (default TCP) and zero protocol number cannot be
used. Network address with zero prefix size cannot be stored
either.</p>

<p>CREATE-OPTIONS := [ family { inet | inet6 } ] | [
hashsize value ] [ maxelem value ] [ timeout value ]</p>

<p>ADD-ENTRY := ipaddr,[proto:]port,netaddr</p>

<p>ADD-OPTIONS := [ timeout value ] [ nomatch ]</p>

<p>DEL-ENTRY := ipaddr,[proto:]port,netaddr</p>

<p>TEST-ENTRY := ipaddr,[proto:]port,netaddr</p>

<p>where netaddr := ip[/cidr]</p>

<p>For the ipaddr and [proto:]port parts of the elements
see the descrip- tions at the hash:ip,port set type. For the
netaddr part of the ele- ments see the description at the
hash:net set type.</p>

<p>Optional create options:</p>

<p>family { inet | inet6 } The protocol family of the IP
addresses to be stored in the set. The default is inet, i.e
IPv4.</p>

<p>hashsize value The initial hash size for the set,
default is 1024. The hash size must be a power of two, the
kernel automatically rounds up non power of two hash sizes
to the first correct value.</p>

<p>maxelem value The maximal number of elements which can
be stored in the set, default 65536.</p>

<p>From the set netfilter match point of view the searching
for a match always starts from the smallest size of netblock
(most specific cidr) to the largest one (least specific
cidr) added to the set. When adding/deleting triples to the
set by the SET netfilter target, it will be added/deleted by
the most specific cidr which can be found in the set, or by
the host cidr value if the set is empty.</p>

<p>The lookup time grows linearly with the number of the
different cidr values added to the set.</p>

<p>The hash:ip,port,net type of sets require three src/dst
parameters of the set match and SET target kernel
modules.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<p>ipset create foo hash:ip,port,net</p>

<p>ipset add foo 192.168.1,80,10.0.0/24</p>

<p>ipset add foo 192.168.2,25,10.1.0.0/16</p>

<p>ipset test foo 192.168.1,80.10.0.0/24</p>

<p>hash:net,iface The hash:net,iface set type uses a hash
to store different sized IP network address and interface
name pairs. Network address with zero prefix size is not
accepted.</p>

<p>CREATE-OPTIONS := [ family { inet | inet6 } ] | [
hashsize value ] [ maxelem value ] [ timeout value ]</p>

<p>ADD-ENTRY := netaddr,[physdev:]iface</p>

<p>ADD-OPTIONS := [ timeout value ] [ nomatch ]</p>

<p>DEL-ENTRY := netaddr,[physdev:]iface</p>

<p>TEST-ENTRY := netaddr,[physdev:]iface</p>

<p>where netaddr := ip[/cidr]</p>

<p>Optional create options:</p>

<p>family { inet | inet6 } The protocol family of the IP
addresses to be stored in the set. The default is inet, i.e
IPv4.</p>

<p>hashsize value The initial hash size for the set,
default is 1024. The hash size must be a power of two, the
kernel automatically rounds up non power of two hash sizes
to the first correct value.</p>

<p>maxelem value The maximal number of elements which can
be stored in the set, default 65536.</p>

<p>For the netaddr part of the elements see the description
at the hash:net set type.</p>

<p>When adding/deleting/testing entries, if the cidr prefix
parameter is not specified, then the host prefix value is
assumed. When adding/deleting entries, the exact element is
added/deleted and over- lapping elements are not checked by
the kernel. When testing entries, if a host address is
tested, then the kernel tries to match the host address in
the networks added to the set and reports the result accord-
ingly.</p>

<p>From the set netfilter match point of view the searching
for a match always starts from the smallest size of netblock
(most specific prefix) to the largest one (least specific
prefix) added to the set. When adding/deleting IP addresses
to the set by the SET netfilter target, it will be
added/deleted by the most specific prefix which can be found
in the set, or by the host prefix value if the set is
empty.</p>

<p>The second direction parameter of the set match and SET
target modules corresponds to the incoming/outgoing
interface : src to the incoming, while dst to the outgoing.
When the interface is flagged with physdev:, the interface
is interpreted as the incoming/outgoing bridge port.</p>

<p>The lookup time grows linearly with the number of the
different prefix values added to the set.</p>

<p>The internal restriction of the hash:net,iface set type
is that the same network prefix cannot be stored with more
than 64 different inter- faces in a single set.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<p>ipset create foo hash:net,iface</p>

<p>ipset add foo 192.168.0/24,eth0</p>

<p>ipset add foo 10.1.0.0/16,eth1</p>

<p>ipset test foo 192.168.0/24,eth0</p>

<p>list:set The list:set type uses a simple list in which
you can store set names.</p>

<p>CREATE-OPTIONS := [ size value ] [ timeout value ]</p>

<p>ADD-ENTRY := setname [ { before | after } setname ]</p>

<p>ADD-OPTIONS := [ timeout value ]</p>

<p>DEL-ENTRY := setname [ { before | after } setname ]</p>

<p>TEST-ENTRY := setname [ { before | after } setname ]</p>

<p>Optional create options:</p>

<p>size value The size of the list, the default is 8.</p>

<p>By the ipset commad you can add, delete and test set
names in a list:set type of set.</p>

<p>By the set match or SET target of netfilter you can
test, add or delete entries in the sets added to the
list:set type of set. The match will try to find a matching
entry in the sets and the target will try to add an entry to
the first set to which it can be added. The number of
direction options of the match and target are important:
sets which require more parameters than specified are
skipped, while sets with equal or less parameters are
checked, elements added/deleted. For exam- ple if a and b
are list:set type of sets then in the command</p>

<p>iptables -m set --match-set a src,dst -j SET --add-set b
src,dst</p>

<p>the match and target will skip any set in a and b which
stores data triples, but will match all sets with single or
double data storage in a set and stop matching at the first
successful set, and add src to the first single or src,dst
to the first double data storage set in b to which the entry
can be added. You can imagine a list:set type of set as an
ordered union of the set elements.</p>

<p>Please note: by the ipset commad you can add, delete and
test the set- names in a list:set type of set, and not the
presence of a sets member (such as an IP address).</p>

<p>GENERAL RESTRICTIONS Zero valued set entries cannot be
used with hash methods. Zero protocol value with ports
cannot be used.</p>

<p>COMMENTS If you want to store same size subnets from a
given network (say /24 blocks from a /8 network), use the
bitmap:ip set type. If you want to store random same size
networks (say random /24 blocks), use the hash:ip set type.
If you have got random size of netblocks, use hash:net.</p>

<p>Backward compatibility is maintained and old ipset
syntax is still sup- ported.</p>

<p>The iptree and iptreemap set types are removed: if you
refer to them, they are automatically replaced by hash:ip
type of sets.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS Various error messages are printed to
standard error. The exit code is 0 for correct
functioning.</p>

<p>BUGS Bugs? No, just funny features. :-) OK, just
kidding...</p>
