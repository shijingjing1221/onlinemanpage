<p>HOSTNAME(7) Linux Programmer s Manual HOSTNAME(7)</p>

<p>NAME hostname - hostname resolution description</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Hostnames are domains, where a domain is a
hierarchical, dot-separated list of subdomains; for example,
the machine monet, in the Berkeley subdomain of the EDU
subdomain of the Internet would be represented as</p>

<p>monet.Berkeley.EDU</p>

<p>(with no trailing dot).</p>

<p>Hostnames are often used with network client and server
programs, which must generally translate the name to an
address for use. (This task is generally performed by either
getaddrinfo(3) or the obsolete gethostby- name(3).)
Hostnames are resolved by the Internet name resolver in the
following fashion.</p>

<p>If the name consists of a single component, that is,
contains no dot, and if the environment variable HOSTALIASES
is set to the name of a file, that file is searched for any
string matching the input hostname. The file should consist
of lines made up of two white-space separated strings, the
first of which is the hostname alias, and the second of
which is the complete hostname to be substituted for that
alias. If a case-insensitive match is found between the
hostname to be resolved and the first field of a line in the
file, the substituted name is looked up with no further
processing.</p>

<p>If the input name ends with a trailing dot, the trailing
dot is removed, and the remaining name is looked up with no
further process- ing.</p>

<p>If the input name does not end with a trailing dot, it
is looked up by searching through a list of domains until a
match is found. The default search list includes first the
local domain, then its parent domains with at least 2 name
components (longest first). For example, in the domain
CS.Berkeley.EDU, the name lithium.CChem will be checked
first as lithium.CChem.CS.Berkeley.EDU and then as
lithium.CChem.Berke- ley.EDU. Lithium.CChem.EDU will not be
tried, as there is only one component remaining from the
local domain. The search path can be changed from the
default by a system-wide configuration file (see
resolver(5)).</p>
