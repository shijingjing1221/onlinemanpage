<p>NAME ipcrm - remove a message queue, semaphore set or
shared memory id</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ipcrm [ -M key | -m id | -Q key | -q id | -S
key | -s id ] ...</p>

<p>deprecated usage</p>

<p>ipcrm {shm|msg|sem} id...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION ipcrm removes System V interprocess
communication (IPC) objects and associated data structures
from the system. In order to delete such objects, you must
be superuser, or the creator or owner of the object.</p>

<p>System V IPC objects are of three types: shared memory,
message queues, and semaphores. Deletion of a message queue
or semaphore object is immediate (regardless of whether any
process still holds an IPC identi- fier for the object). A
shared memory object is only removed after all currently
attached processes have detached (shmdt(2)) the object from
their virtual address space.</p>

<p>Two syntax styles are supported. The old Linux
historical syntax spec- ifies a three letter keyword
indicating which class of object is to be deleted, followed
by one or more IPC identifiers for objects of this type.</p>

<p>The SUS-compliant syntax allows the specification of
zero or more objects of all three types in a single command
line, with objects spec- ified either by key or by
identifier. (See below.) Both keys and iden- tifiers may be
specified in decimal, hexadecimal (specified with an initial
0x or 0X), or octal (specified with an initial 0).</p>

<p>OPTIONS -M shmkey removes the shared memory segment
created with shmkey after the last detach is performed.</p>

<p>-m shmid removes the shared memory segment identified by
shmid after the last detach is performed.</p>

<p>-Q msgkey removes the message queue created with
msgkey.</p>

<p>-q msgid removes the message queue identified by
msgid.</p>

<p>-S semkey removes the semaphore created with semkey.</p>

<p>-s semid removes the semaphore identified by semid.</p>

<p>The details of the removes are described in msgctl(2),
shmctl(2), and semctl(2). The identifiers and keys may be
found by using ipcs(1).</p>

<p>NOTES In its first Linux implementation, ipcrm used the
deprecated syntax shown in the SYNOPSIS. Functionality
present in other *nix implementa- tions of ipcrm has since
been added, namely the ability to delete resources by key
(not just identifier), and to respect the same com-
mand-line syntax. For backward compatibility the previous
syntax is still supported.</p>

<p>AVAILABILITY The ipcrm command is part of the
util-linux-ng package and is available from
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux-ng/.</p>
