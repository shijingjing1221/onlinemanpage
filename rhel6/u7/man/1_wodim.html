<p>NAME wodim - write data to optical disk media</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS wodim [options] track1...trackn</p>

<p>NOTE There may be similarities and differences between
this program and other disk recording application(s). See
the CREDITS and AUTHORS sec- tions below to learn about the
origin of wodim.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION wodim is used to record data or audio
Compact Discs on an Orange Book CD-Recorder or to write DVD
media on a DVD-Recorder.</p>

<p>The device is the device file or label offered by the
operating system to access the recorder with SCSI GENERIC
(sg) interface. Note that some operating systems may provide
separate device nodes for block-oriented and sg access. For
example, on older Linux systems, the sg access was available
through /dev/sg... files while the block oriented access was
done through associated (but not identical) /dev/hd... and
/dev/sr... (or /dev/scd... ) files.</p>

<p>In any case, the user running wodim needs read and write
access to the particular device file on a Linux system. It
is recommended to be root or install the application as
suid-root, because certain versions of Linux (kernel) limit
the set of SCSI commands allowed for non-root users. Even if
usage without root identity is possible in many cases, some
device drivers still may fail, show unexplainable problems
and generally the problems become harder to debug. The risk
for buffer- underruns is also increased. See the PROCESS
SCHEDULING PRIORITY sec- tion below for more details.</p>

<p>There is an alternative way of specifying the device,
using the tradi- tional SCSI descriptions in form of
devicetype:bus/target/lun specifi- cation. However, the
success of this method is not guaranteed since it requires
an adaptation scheme for your architecture, and the numbers
may vary depending on the hardware-internal numbering or on
the order of hot-plug device detection. If your operating
system does not provide a sufficient framework for keeping
this numbers persistent, dont rely on them. See -scanbus and
--devices options below for details.</p>

<p>There are emulated SCSI compatible device systems, using
the SCSI pro- tocols transported over various hardware/media
types. The most known examples is ATAPI (&quot;IDE
burners&quot;) or USB storage (&quot;external USB
case&quot;). If the pseudo-SCSI b/t/l device address
specification is used instead of the native one, you need to
prepend the &quot;devicetype:&quot; description to the
emulated &quot;bus/target/lun&quot; device address.</p>

<p>If a file /etc/wodim.conf exists, the parameter to the
dev= option may also be a drive name label in that file (see
FILES section).</p>

<p>As a special exception, the device specification can be
-1 or just omitted, which invokes automatic guessing of an
appropriate device for the selected operation. However, this
guessing is not available every- where and is not reliable;
it is only available for the users conve- nience in simple
environments.</p>

<p>In Track At Once mode, each track corresponds to a
single file that contains the prepared data for that track.
If the argument is -, standard input is used for that track.
Only one track may be taken from stdin. In the other write
modes, the direct file to track rela- tion may not be
implemented. In -clone mode, a single file contains all data
for the whole disk. To allow DVD writing on platforms that
do not implement large file support, wodim concatenates all
file arguments to a single track when writing to DVD
media.</p>

<p>PROCESS SCHEDULING PRIORITY Wodim tries to get higher
process priority using different methods. This is important
because the burn process is usually a realtime task, no long
delays should occur while transmitting fresh data to the
recorder. This is especially important on systems with
insufficient RAM where swapping can create delays of many
seconds.</p>

<p>A possible workaround on underpowered systems is the use
of the burn- free or similar feature, allowing the recorder
to resume.</p>

<p>Root permissions are usually required to get higher
process scheduling priority.</p>

<p>On SVr4 compliant systems, wodim uses the real time
class to get the highest scheduling priority that is
possible (higher than all kernel processes). On systems with
POSIX real time scheduling wodim uses real time scheduling
too, but may not be able to gain a priority that is higher
than all kernel processes.</p>

<p>In order to be able to use the SCSI transport subsystem
of the OS, run at highest priority and lock itself into core
wodim either needs to be run as root, needs to be installed
suid root or must be called via RBACs pfexec mechanism.</p>

<p>GENERAL OPTIONS General options must be before any track
file name or track option.</p>

<p>-version Print version information and exit.</p>

<p>-v Increment the level of general verbosity by one. This
is used e.g. to display the progress of the writing
process.</p>

<p>-V Increment the verbose level in respect of SCSI
command transport by one. This helps to debug problems
during the writing pro- cess, that occur in the
CD/DVD-Recorder. If you get incompre- hensible error
messages you should use this flag to get more detailed
output. -VV will show data buffer content in addition. Using
-V or -VV slows down the process and may be the reason for a
buffer underrun.</p>

<p>debug=#, -d Set the misc debug value to # (with debug=#)
or increment the misc debug level by one (with -d). If you
specify -dd, this equals to debug=2. This may help to find
problems while opening a driver for libusal as well as with
sector sizes and sector types. Using -debug slows down the
process and may be the rea- son for a buffer underrun.</p>

<p>kdebug=#, kd=# Tell the usal-driver to modify the kernel
debug value while SCSI commands are running.</p>

<p>-silent, -s Do not print out a status report for failed
SCSI commands.</p>

<p>-force Force to continue on some errors. Be careful when
using this option. wodim implements several checks that
prevent you from doing unwanted things like damaging CD-RW
media by improper drives. Many of the sanity checks are
disabled when the -force option is used.</p>

<p>This option also implements some tricks that will allow
you to blank bad CD-RW disks.</p>

<p>-immed Tell wodim to set the SCSI IMMED flag in certain
commands (load/eject/blank/close_track/close_session). This
can be use- ful on broken systems with ATAPI harddisk and
CD/DVD writer on the same bus or with SCSI systems that dont
use discon- nect/reconnect. These systems will freeze while
blanking or fixating a CD/DVD or while a DVD writer is
filling up a session to the minimum amount (approx. 800 MB).
Setting the -immed flag will request the command to return
immediately while the opera- tion proceeds in background,
making the bus usable for the other devices and avoiding the
system freeze. This is an experimental feature which may
work or not, depending on the model of the CD/DVD writer. A
correct solution would be to set up a correct cabling but
there seem to be notebooks around that have been set up the
wrong way by the manufacturer. As it is impossible to fix
this problem in notebooks, the -immed option has been
added.</p>

<p>A second experimental feature of the -immed flag is to
tell wodim to try to wait short times while writing to the
media. This is expected to free the IDE bus if the CD/DVD
writer and the data source are connected to the same IDE
cable. In this case, the CD/DVD writer would otherwise
usually block the IDE bus for nearly all the time making it
impossible to fetch data from the source drive. See also
minbuf= and -v option.</p>

<p>Use both features at your own risk. If it turns out that
it would make sense to have a separate option for the wait
feature, write to the author and convince him.</p>

<p>minbuf=value The # minbuf= option allows to define the
minimum drive buffer fill ratio for the experimental ATAPI
wait mode that is intended to free the IDE bus to allow hard
disk and CD/DVD writer to be on the same IDE cable. As the
wait mode currently only works when the verbose option -v
has been specified, wodim implies the verbose option in case
the -immed or minbuf= option have been specified. Valid
values for minbuf= are between 25 and 95 for 25%...95%
minimum drive buffer fill ratio.</p>

<p>-dummy The CD/DVD-Recorder will go through all steps of
the recording process, but the laser is turned off during
this procedure. It is recommended to run several tests
before actually writing to a Compact Disk or Digital
Versatile Disk, if the timing and load response of the
system is not known.</p>

<p>-clone Tells wodim to handle images created by readom
-clone. The -clone may only be used in conjunction with with
the -raw96r or with the -raw16 option. Using -clone together
with -raw96r is preferred as it allows to write all
subchannel data. The option -raw16 should only be used with
drives that do not support to write in -raw96r mode.</p>

<p>-dao</p>

<p>-sao Set SAO (Session At Once) mode which is usually
called Disk At Once mode. This currently only works with MMC
drives that sup- port Session At Once mode. Note that wodim
needs to know the size of each track in advance for this
mode (see the genisoimage -print-size option and the
EXAMPLES section for more informa- tion).</p>

<p>-tao Set TAO (Track At Once) writing mode. This is the
default write mode in previous wodim versions. With most
drives, this write mode is required for multi session
recording.</p>

<p>-raw Set RAW writing mode. Using this option defaults to
-raw96r. Note that wodim needs to know the size of each
track in advance for this mode (see the genisoimage
-print-size option and the EXAMPLES section for more
information).</p>

<p>-raw96r Select Set RAW writing mode with 2352 byte
sectors plus 96 bytes of raw P-W subchannel data resulting
in a sector size of 2448 bytes. This is the preferred raw
writing mode as it gives best control over the CD writing
process. If you find any problems with the layout of a disk
or with sub channel content (e.g. wrong times on the display
when playing the CD) and your drive supports to write in
-raw96r or -raw16 mode, you should give it a try. There are
several CD writers with bad firmware that result in broken
disks when writing in TAO or SAO mode. Writing data disks in
raw mode needs significantly more CPU time than other write
modes. If your CPU is too slow, this may result in buffer
underruns. Note that wodim needs to know the size of each
track in advance for this mode (see the genisoimage -print-
size option and the EXAMPLES section for more
information).</p>

<p>-raw96p Select Set RAW writing mode with 2352 byte
sectors plus 96 bytes of packed P-W subchannel data
resulting in a sector size of 2448 bytes. This is the less
preferred raw writing mode as only a few recorders support
it and some of these recorders have bugs in the firmware
implementation. Dont use this mode if your recorder supports
-raw96r or -raw16. Writing data disks in raw mode needs
significantly more CPU time than other write modes. If your
CPU is too slow, this may result in buffer underruns. Note
that wodim needs to know the size of each track in advance
for this mode (see the genisoimage -print-size option and
the EXAMPLES section for more information).</p>

<p>-raw16 Select Set RAW writing mode with 2352 byte
sectors plus 16 bytes of P-Q subchannel data resulting in a
sector size of 2368 bytes. If a recorder does not support
-raw96r, this is the preferred raw writing mode. It does not
allow to write CD-Text or CD+Graphics but it is the only raw
writing mode in cheap CD writers. As these cheap writers in
most cases do not support -dao mode. Don t use this mode if
your recorder supports -raw96r. Writing data disks in raw
mode needs significantly more CPU time than other write
modes. If your CPU is too slow, this may result in buffer
underruns. Note that wodim needs to know the size of each
track in advance for this mode (see the genisoimage
-print-size option and the EXAMPLES section for more
information).</p>

<p>-multi Allow multi session CDs to be made. This flag
needs to be present on all sessions of a multi session disk,
except you want to create a session that will be the last
session on the media. The fixation will be done in a way
that allows the CD/DVD- Recorder to append additional
sessions later. This is done by generation a TOC with a link
to the next program area. The so generated media is not 100%
compatible to manufactured CDs (except for CDplus). Use only
for recording of multi session CDs. If this option is
present, the default track type is CD- ROM XA mode 2 form 1
and the sector size is 2048 bytes. The XA sector subheaders
will be created by the drive. The Sony drives have no
hardware support for CD-ROM XA mode 2 form 1. You have to
specify the -data option in order to create multi session
disks on these drives. As long as wodim does not have a
coder for converting data sectors to audio sectors, you need
to force CD-ROM sectors by including the -data option if you
like to record a multisession disk in SAO mode. Not all
drives allow multisession CDs in SAO mode.</p>

<p>-msinfo Retrieve multi session info in a form suitable
for genisoimage and print it to standard output. See
msifile= option for another version.</p>

<p>This option makes only sense with a CD that contains at
least one closed session and is appendable (not finally
closed yet). Some drives create error messages if you try to
get the multi session info for a disk that is not suitable
for this operation.</p>

<p>msifile=filename Like -msinfo option but also stores the
multi session info in a file.</p>

<p>-toc Retrieve and print out the table of content or PMA
of a CD. With this option, wodim will work with CD-R drives
and with CD- ROM drives.</p>

<p>-atip Retrieve and print out the ATIP (absolute Time in
Pre-groove) info of a CD/DVD recordable or CD/DVD
re-writable media. With this option, wodim will try to
retrieve the ATIP info. If the actual drive does not support
to read the ATIP info, it may be that only a reduced set of
information records or even nothing is displayed. Only a
limited number of MMC compliant drives sup- port to read the
ATIP info.</p>

<p>If wodim is able to retrieve the lead-in start time for
the first session, it will try to decode and print the
manufacturer info from the media. DVD media does not have
ATIP information but there is equivalent prerecorded
information that is read out and printed.</p>

<p>-fix The disk will only be fixated (i.e. a TOC for a
CD-Reader will be written). This may be used, if for some
reason the disk has been written but not fixated. This
option currently does not work with old TEAC drives (CD-R50S
and CD-R55S).</p>

<p>-nofix Do not fixate the disk after writing the tracks.
This may be used to create an audio disk in steps. An
un-fixated disk can usually not be used on a non CD-writer
type drive but there are audio CD players that will be able
to play such a disk.</p>

<p>-waiti Wait for input to become available on standard
input before try- ing to open the SCSI driver. This allows
wodim to read its input from a pipe even when writing
additional sessions to a multi session disk. When writing
another session to a multi session disk, genisoimage needs
to read the old session from the device before writing
output. This cannot be done if wodim opens the SCSI driver
at the same time.</p>

<p>-load Load the media and exit. This only works with a
tray loading mechanism but seems to be useful when using the
Kodak disk transporter.</p>

<p>-lock Load the media, lock the door and exit. This only
works with a tray loading mechanism but seems to be useful
when using the Kodak disk transporter.</p>

<p>-eject Eject disk after doing the work. Some devices
(e.g. Philips) need to eject the medium before creating a
new disk. Doing a -dummy test and immediately creating a
real disk would not work on these devices.</p>

<p>speed=# Set the speed factor of the writing process to
#. # is an inte- ger, representing a multiple of the audio
speed. This is about 150 KB/s for CD-ROM, about 172 KB/s for
CD-Audio and about 1385 kB/s for DVD media. If no speed
option is present, wodim will try to get a drive specific
speed value from the file /etc/wodim.conf and if it cannot
find one, it will try to get the speed value from the
CDR_SPEED environment and later from the CDR_SPEED= entry in
/etc/wodim.conf. If no speed value could be found, wodim
uses a drive specific default speed. The default for all new
(MMC compliant) drives is to use the maximum supported by
the drive. If you use speed=0 with a MMC compliant drive,
wodim will switch to the lowest possible speed for drive and
medium. If you are using an old (non MMC) drive that has
problems with speed=2 or speed=4, you should try
speed=0.</p>

<p>blank=type Blank a CD-RW and exit or blank a CD-RW
before writing. The blanking type may be one of:</p>

<p>help Display a list of possible blanking types.</p>

<p>all Blank the entire disk. This may take a long
time.</p>

<p>fast Minimally blank the disk. This results in erasing
the PMA, the TOC and the pregap.</p>

<p>track Blank a track.</p>

<p>unreserve Unreserve a reserved track.</p>

<p>trtail Blank the tail of a track.</p>

<p>unclose Unclose last session.</p>

<p>session Blank the last session. Not all drives support
all blanking types. It may be necessary to use blank=all if
a drive reports a specified command as being invalid. If
used together with the -force flag, this option may be used
to blank CD-RW disks that otherwise cannot be blanked. Note
that you may need to specify blank=all because some drives
will not continue with certain types of bad CD-RW disks.
Note also that wodim does its best if the -force flag is
used but it finally depends on the drives firmware whether
the blanking operation will succeed or not.</p>

<p>-format Format a CD-RW/DVD-RW/DVD+RW disc. Formatting is
currently only implemented for DVD+RW media. A maiden DVD+RW
media needs to be formatted before you may write to it.
However, as wodim autodetects the need for formatting in
this case and auto for- mats the medium before it starts
writing, the -format option is only needed if you like to
forcibly reformat a DVD+RW medium.</p>

<p>fs=# Set the FIFO (ring buffer) size to #. You may use
the same syn- tax as in dd(1), sdd(1) or star(1). The number
representing the size is taken in bytes unless otherwise
specified. If a number is followed directly by the letter b,
k, m, s or f, the size is multiplied by 512, 1024,
1024*1024, 2048 or 2352. If the size consists of numbers
separated by x or * , multi- plication of the two numbers is
performed. Thus fs=10x63k will specify a FIFO size of 630
kBytes.</p>

<p>The size specified by the fs= argument includes the
shared memory that is needed for administration. This is at
least one page of memory. If no fs= option is present, wodim
will try to get the FIFO size value from the CDR_FIFOSIZE
environment. The default FIFO size is currently 4 MB.</p>

<p>The FIFO is used to increase buffering for the real time
writing process. It allows to run a pipe from genisoimage
directly into wodim. If the FIFO is active and a pipe from
genisoimage into wodim is used to create a CD, wodim will
abort prior to do any modifications on the disk if
genisoimage dies before it starts writing. The recommended
FIFO size is between 4 and 128 MBytes. As a rule of thumb,
the FIFO size should be at least equal to the size of the
internal buffer of the CD/DVD-Recorder and no more than half
of the physical amount of RAM available in the machine. If
the FIFO size is big enough, the FIFO statistics will print
a FIFO empty count of zero and the FIFO min fill is not
below 20%. It is not wise to use too much space for the
FIFO. If you need more than 8 MB to write a CD at a speed
less than 20x from an image on a local file system on an
idle machine, your machine is either underpowered, has
hardware prob- lems or is mis-configured. If you like to
write DVDs or CDs at higher speed, it makes sense to use at
least 16 MB for the FIFO.</p>

<p>On old and small machines, you need to be more careful
with the FIFO size. If your machine has less than 256 MB of
physical RAM, you should not set up a FIFO size that is more
than 32 MB. The sun4c architecture (e.g. a Sparcstation-2)
has only MMU page table entries for 16 MBytes per process.
Using more than 14 MBytes for the FIFO may cause the
operating system in this case to spend much time to
constantly reload the MMU tables. Newer machines from Sun do
not have this MMU hardware problem. I have no information on
PC-hardware reflecting this problem.</p>

<p>Old Linux systems for non x86 platforms have broken
definitions for the shared memory size. You need to fix them
and rebuild the kernel or manually tell wodim to use a
smaller FIFO.</p>

<p>If you have buffer underruns or similar problems (like a
con- stantly empty drive buffer) and observe a zero fifo
empty count, you have hardware problems that prevents the
data from flowing fast enough from the kernel memory to the
drive. The FIFO size in this case is sufficient, but you
should check for a working DMA setup.</p>

<p>ts=# Set the maximum transfer size for a single SCSI
command to #. The syntax for the ts= option is the same as
for wodim fs=# or sdd bs=#.</p>

<p>If no ts= option has been specified, wodim defaults to a
trans- fer size of 63 kB. If libusal gets lower values from
the operat- ing system, the value is reduced to the maximum
value that is possible with the current operating system.
Sometimes, it may help to further reduce the transfer size
or to enhance it, but note that it may take a long time to
find a better value by experimenting with the ts=
option.</p>

<p>dev=target Sets the SCSI target for the CD/DVD-Recorder,
see notes above. A typical device specification is dev=6,0 .
A filename or vir- tual device name can be passed instead of
the symbolic SCSI num- bers. The correct device/filename in
this case can be found in the system specific manuals of the
target operating system. On a FreeBSD system without CAM
support, you need to use the con- trol device (e.g.
/dev/rcd0.ctl). A correct device specifica- tion in this
case may be dev=/dev/rcd0.ctl:@ .</p>

<p>On Linux and Windows 2000/XP, drives are accessible with
their device (or drive) names or with the symbolic SCSI
numbers (not recommended, mapping is not stable and could be
completely removed in the future).</p>

<p>If no dev option is present, wodim will try to get the
device from the CDR_DEVICE environment.</p>

<p>If the argument to the dev= option does not contain the
charac- ters ,, /, @ or :, it is interpreted as an label
name that may be found in the file /etc/wodim.conf (see
FILES sec- tion).</p>

<p>gracetime=# Set the grace time before starting to write
to # seconds. Val- ues below 2 seconds are not recommended
to give the kernel or volume management a chance to learn
the new state.</p>

<p>timeout=# Set the default SCSI command timeout value to
# seconds. The default SCSI command timeout is the minimum
timeout used for sending SCSI commands. If a SCSI command
fails due to a time- out, you may try to raise the default
SCSI command timeout above the timeout value of the failed
command. If the command runs correctly with a raised command
timeout, please report the bet- ter timeout value and the
corresponding command to the author of the program. If no
timeout option is present, a default timeout of 40 seconds
is used.</p>

<p>driver=name Allows the user to manually select a driver
for the device. The reason for the existence of the
driver=name option is to allow users to use wodim with
drives that are similar to supported drives but not known
directly by wodim. All drives made after 1997 should be MMC
standard compliant and thus supported by one of the MMC
drivers. It is most unlikely that wodim is unable to find
the right driver automatically. Use this option with extreme
care. If a wrong driver is used for a device, the possi-
bility of creating corrupted disks is high. The minimum
problem related to a wrong driver is that the speed= or
-dummy will not work.</p>

<p>The following driver names are supported:</p>

<p>help To get a list of possible drivers together with a
short description.</p>

<p>mmc_cd The generic SCSI-3/mmc CD-ROM driver is
auto-selected whenever wodim finds a MMC compliant drive
that does not identify itself to support writing at all, or
that only identifies to support media or write modes not
imple- mented in wodim.</p>

<p>mmc_cd_dvd The generic SCSI-3/mmc CD/DVD driver is
auto-selected whenever wodim finds a MMC-2 or MMC-3
compliant drive that seems to support more than one medium
type and the tray is open or no medium could be found to
select the right driver. This driver tries to close the
tray, checks the medium found in the tray and then branches
to the driver that matches the current medium.</p>

<p>mmc_cdr The generic SCSI-3/mmc CD-R/CD-RW driver is
auto-selected whenever wodim find a MMC compliant drive that
only sup- ports to write CDs or a multi system drive that
contains a CD as the current medium.</p>

<p>mmc_cdr_sony The generic SCSI-3/mmc CD-R/CD-RW driver is
auto-selected whenever wodim would otherwise select the
mmc_cdr driver but the device seems to be made by Sony. The
mmc_cdr_sony is definitely needed for the Sony CDU 928 as
this drive does not completely implement the MMC standard
and some of the MMC SCSI commands have to be replaced by
Sony proprietary commands. It seems that all Sony drives
(even newer ones) still implement the Sony proprietary SCSI
commands so it has not yet become a problem to use this
driver for all Sony drives. If you find a newer Sony drive
that does not work with this driver, please report.</p>

<p>mmc_dvd The generic SCSI-3/mmc-2 DVD-R/DVD-RW driver is
auto- selected whenever wodim finds a MMC-2 or MMC-3
compliant drive that supports to write DVDs and an
appropriate medium is loaded. There is no Track At Once mode
for DVD writers.</p>

<p>mmc_dvdplus The generic SCSI-3/mmc-3 DVD+R/DVD+RW driver
is auto- selected whenever one of the DVD+ media types that
are incompatible to each other is found. It checks media and
then branches to the driver that matches the current
medium.</p>

<p>mmc_dvdplusr The generic SCSI-3/mmc-3 DVD+R driver is
auto-selected whenever a DVD+R medium is found in an
appropriate writer. Note that for unknown reason, the
DVD-Plus alliance does not like that there is a simulation
mode for DVD+R media. The author of wodim tries to convince
manufacturers to implement a simulation mode for DVD+R and
implement support. DVD+R only supports one write mode that
is somewhere between Track At Once and Packet writing; this
mode is selected in wodim via a the -dao/-sao option.</p>

<p>mmc_dvdplusrw The generic SCSI-3/mmc-3 DVD+RW driver is
auto-selected whenever a DVD+RW medium is found in an
appropriate writer. As DVD+RW media needs to be formatted
before its first use, wodim auto-detects this media state
and per- forms a format before it starts to write. Note that
for unknown reason, the DVD-Plus alliance does not like that
there is a simulation mode nor a way to erase DVD+RW media.
DVD+RW only supports one write mode that is close to Packet
writing; this mode is selected in wodim via a the -dao/-sao
option.</p>

<p>cw_7501 The driver for Matsushita/Panasonic CW-7501 is
auto- selected when wodim finds this old pre MMC drive.
wodim supports all write modes for this drive type.</p>

<p>kodak_pcd_600 The driver for Kodak PCD-600 is
auto-selected when wodim finds this old pre MMC drive which
has been the first high speed (6x) CD writer for a long
time. This drive behaves similar to the Philips CDD-521
drive.</p>

<p>philips_cdd521 The driver for Philips CDD-521 is
auto-selected when wodim finds a Philips CDD-521 drive
(which is the first CD writer ever made) or one of the other
drives that are known to behave similar to this drive. All
Philips CDD-521 or similar drives (see other drivers in this
list) do not support Session At Once recording.</p>

<p>philips_cdd521_old The driver for Philips old CDD-521 is
auto-selected when wodim finds a Philips CDD-521 with very
old firmware which has some known limitations.</p>

<p>philips_cdd522 The driver for Philips CDD-522 is
auto-selected when wodim finds a Philips CDD-522 which is
the successor of the 521 or one of its variants with Kodak
label. wodim does not support Session At Once recording with
these drives.</p>

<p>philips_dumb The driver for Philips CDD-521 with
pessimistic assump- tions is never auto-selected. It may be
used by hand with drives that behave similar to the Philips
CDD-521.</p>

<p>pioneer_dws114x The driver for Pioneer DW-S114X is
auto-selected when wodim finds one of the old non MMC CD

command set used by TEAC and JVC. Note that many drives from
JVC will not work because they do not correctly implement
the documented command set and JVC has been unwilling to fix
or document the bugs. There is no support for the Ses- sion

variant of the Philips CDD-521 command set.</p>

<p>yamaha_cdr100 The driver for Yamaha CDR-100 / CDR-102 is
auto-selected when wodim finds one of the old pre MMC CD
writers from Yamaha. There is no support for the Session At
Once write mode yet.</p>

<p>cdr_simul The simulation CD-R driver allows to run
timing and speed tests with parameters that match the
behavior of CD writ- ers.</p>

<p>dvd_simul The simulation DVD-R driver allows to run
timing and speed tests with parameters that match the
behavior of DVD writers.</p>

<p>There are two special driver entries in the list:
cdr_simul and dvd_simul. These driver entries are designed
to make timing tests at any speed or timing tests for drives
that do not sup- port the -dummy option. The simulation
drivers implement a drive with a buffer size of 1 MB that
can be changed via the CDR_SIMUL_BUFSIZE environment
variable. The simulation driver correctly simulates even a
buffer underrun condition. If the -dummy option is present,
the simulation is not aborted in case of a buffer
underrun.</p>

<p>driveropts=option list Set driver specific options. The
options are specified a comma separated list. To get a list
of valid options use driveropts=help together with the
-checkdrive option. If you like to set driver options
without running a typical wodim task, you need to use the
-setdropts option in addition, otherwise the command line
parser in wodim will complain. Currently imple- mented
driver options are:</p>

<p>burnfree Turn the support for Buffer Underrun Free
writing on. This only works for drives that support Buffer
Underrun Free technology, which is available on most drives
manu- factured in this millennium. This may be called: Sanyo
BURN-Proof, Ricoh Just-Link, Yamaha Lossless-Link or sim-
ilar.</p>

<p>This option is deprecated and is mentioned here for
docu- mentation purposes only. The BURN-Free feature is
enabled by default if the drive supports it. However, use of
BURN-Free may cause decreased burning quality. Therefore it
can be useful to disable it for certain purposes, eg. when
creating a master copy for mass CD production.</p>

<p>noburnfree Turn the support for Buffer Underrun Free
writing off.</p>

<p>varirec=value Turn on the Plextor VariRec writing mode.
The mandatory parameter value is the laser power offset and
currently may be selected from -2, -1, 0, 1, 2. In addition,
you need to set the write speed to 4 in order to allow
VariRec to work.</p>

<p>gigarec=value Manage the Plextor GigaRec writing mode.
The mandatory parameter value is the disk capacity ratio
compared to normal recording and currently may be selected
from 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4. If values &lt; 1.0
are used, then the effect is similar to the Yamaha Audio
Master Q. R. feature. If values &gt; 1.0 are used, then the
disk capacity is increased.</p>

<p>Not all drives support all GigaRec values. When a drive
uses the GigaRec feature, the write speed is limited to
8x.</p>

<p>audiomaster Turn on the Yamaha Audio Master Q. R.
feature which usu- ally should result in high quality CDs
that have less reading problems in Hi-Fi players. As this is
imple- mented as a variant of the Session at Once write
mode, it will only work if you select SAO write mode and
there is no need to turn it off. The Audio Master mode will
work with a limited speed but may also be used with data
CDs. In Audio Master mode, the pits on the CD will be
written larger then usual so the capacity of the medium is
reduced when turning this feature on. A 74 minute CD will
only have a capacity of 63 minutes if Audio Master is active
and the capacity of a 80 minute CD will be reduced to 68
minutes.</p>

<p>forcespeed Normally, modern drives know the highest
possible speed for different media and may reduce the speed
in order to grant best write quality. This technology may be
called: Plextor PowerRec, Ricoh Just-Speed, Yamaha Optimum
Write Speed Control or similar. Some drives (e.g. Plextor,
Ricoh and Yamaha) allow to force the drive to use the
selected speed even if the medium is so bad that the write
quality would be poor. This option tells such a drive to
force to use the selected speed regardless of the medium
quality.</p>

<p>Use this option with extreme care and note that the
drive should know better which medium will work at full
speed. The default is to turn forcespeed off, regardless of
the defaults of the drive.</p>

<p>noforcespeed Turn off the force speed feature.</p>

<p>speedread Some ultra high speed drives such as 48x and
faster drives from Plextor limit the read speed for unknown
media to e.g. 40x in order to avoid damaged disks and
drives. Using this option tells the drive to read any media
as fast as possible. Be very careful as this may cause the
media to break in the drive while reading, resulting in a
damaged media and drive!</p>

<p>nospeedread Turn off unlimited read speed.</p>

<p>singlesession Turn the drive into a single session only
drive. This allows to read defective or non-compliant
(illegal) media with extremely non-standard additional
(broken/illegal) TOC entries in the TOC from the second or
higher session. Some of these disks become usable if only
the information from the first session is used. You need to
enable Sin- gle Session mode before you insert the defective
disk!</p>

<p>nosinglesession Turn off single session mode. The drive
will again behave as usual.</p>

<p>hidecdr Hide the fact that a medium might be a
recordable medium. This allows to make CD-Rs look like
CD-ROMs and applica- tions believe that the media in the
drive is not a CD-R.</p>

<p>nohidecdr Turn off hiding CD-R media.</p>

<p>tattooinfo Use this option together with -checkdrive to
retrieve the image size information for the Yamaha DiskT@2
feature. The images always have a line length of 3744 pixel.
Line number 0 (radius 0) is mapped to the center of the
disk. If you know the inner and outer radius you will be
able to create a pre distorted image that later may appear
undistorted on the disk.</p>

<p>tattoofile=name Use this option together with
-checkdrive to write an image prepared for the Yamaha
DiskT@2 feature to the medium. The file must be a file with
raw image B&amp;W data (one byte per pixel) in a size as
retrieved by a previous call to tattoofile=name . If the
size of the image equals the maximum possible size (3744 x
320 pixel), wodim will use the first part of the file. This
first part then will be written to the leftover space on the
CD.</p>

<p>Note that the image must be mirrored to be readable from
the pick up side of the CD.</p>

<p>-setdropts Set the driveropts specified by
driveropts=option list, the speed of the drive and the dummy
flag and exit. This allows wodim to set drive specific
parameters that are not directly used by wodim like e.g.
single session mode, hide cdr and simi- lar. It is needed in
case that driveropts=option list should be called without
planning to run a typical wodim task.</p>

<p>-checkdrive Checks if a driver for the current drive is
present and exit. If the drive is a known drive, wodim uses
exit code 0.</p>

<p>-prcap Print the drive capabilities for SCSI-3/mmc
compliant drives as obtained from mode page 0x2A. Values
marked with kB use 1000 bytes as kilo-byte, values marked
with KB use 1024 bytes as Kilo-byte.</p>

<p>-inq Do an inquiry for the drive, print the inquiry info
and exit.</p>

<p>-scanbus Scan all SCSI devices on all SCSI busses and
print the inquiry strings. This option may be used to find
SCSI address of the CD/DVD-Recorder on a system. If some
device types are invisible, try using dev=ATA: or similar
option to give a hint about the device type you are looking
for. The numbers printed out as labels are computed by: bus
* 100 + target. On platforms and device systems without
persistent SCSI number management the results are not
reliable. Use the .B --devices option instead.</p>

<p>--devices Look for useable devices using the system
specific functions, eg. probing with usual device nodes in
/dev/*, and display the detections using symbolic device
names in OS specific syntax.</p>

<p>-reset Try to reset the SCSI bus where the CD recorder
is located. This works not on all operating systems.</p>

<p>-abort Try to send an abort sequence to the drive. If
you use wodim only, this should never be needed; but other
software may leave a drive in an unusable condition. Calling
wodim -reset may be needed if a previous write has been
interrupted and the software did not tell the drive that it
will not continue to write.</p>

<p>-overburn Allow wodim to write more than the official
size of a medium. This feature is usually called overburning
and depends on the fact that most blank media may hold more
space than the official size. As the official size of the
lead-out area on the disk is 90 seconds (6750 sectors) and a
disk usually works if there are at least 150 sectors of lead
out, all media may be overburned by at least 88 seconds
(6600 sectors). Most CD recorders only do overburning in SAO
or RAW mode. Known exceptions are TEAC CD- R50S, TEAC
CD-R55S and the Panasonic CW-7502. Some drives do not allow
to overburn as much as you might like and limit the size of
a CD to e.g. 76 minutes. This problem may be circum- vented
by writing the CD in RAW mode because this way the drive has
no chance to find the size before starting to burn. There is
no guarantee that your drive supports overburning at all.
Make a test to check if your drive implements the
feature.</p>

<p>-ignsize Ignore the known size of the medium. This
option should be used with extreme care, it exists only for
debugging purposes dont use it for other reasons. It is not
needed to write disks with more than the nominal capacity.
This option implies -overburn.</p>

<p>-useinfo Use *.inf files to overwrite audio options. If
this option is used, the pregap size information is read
from the *.inf file that is associated with the file that
contains the audio data for a track.</p>

<p>If used together with the -audio option, wodim may be
used to write audio CDs from a pipe from icedax if you call
wodim with the *.inf files as track parameter list instead
of using audio files. The audio data is read from stdin in
this case. See EXAMPLES section below. wodim first verifies
that stdin is not connected to a terminal and runs some
heuristic consistency checks on the *.inf files and then
sets the track lengths from the information in the *.inf
files.</p>

<p>If you like to write from stdin, make sure that wodim is
called with a large enough FIFO size, reduce the write speed
to a value below the read speed of the source drive and
switch the burn- free option for the recording drive on.</p>

<p>defpregap=# Set the default pre-gap size for all tracks
except track number 1. This option currently only makes
sense with the TEAC drive when creating track-at-once disks
without the 2 second silence before each track. This option
may go away in future.</p>

<p>-packet Set Packet writing mode. This is an experimental
interface.</p>

<p>pktsize=# Set the packet size to #, forces fixed packet
mode. This is an experimental interface.</p>

<p>-noclose Do not close the current track, useful only
when in packet writ- ing mode. This is an experimental
interface.</p>

<p>mcn=med_cat_nr Set the Media Catalog Number of the CD to
med_cat_nr.</p>

<p>-text Write CD-Text information based on information
taken from a file that contains ascii information for the
text strings. wodim supports CD-Text information based on
the content of the *.inf files created by icedax and CD-Text
information based on the content from a CUE sheet file. If a
CUE sheet file contains both (binary CDTEXTFILE and text
based SONGWRITER) entries, then the information based on the
CDTEXTFILE entry will win.</p>

<p>You need to use the -useinfo option in addition in order
to tell wodim to read the *.inf files or cuefile=filename in
order to tell wodim to read a CUE sheet file in addition. If
you like to write your own CD-Text information, edit the
*.inf files or the CUE sheet file with a text editor and
change the fields that are relevant for CD-Text.</p>

<p>textfile=filename Write CD-Text based on information
found in the binary file filename. This file must contain
information in a data format defined in the SCSI-3 MMC-2
standard and in the Red Book. The four byte size header that
is defined in the SCSI standard is optional and allows to
make the recognition of correct data less ambiguous. This is
the best option to be used to copy CD-Text data from
existing CDs that already carry CD-Text information. To get
data in a format suitable for this option use wodim -vv -toc
to extract the information from disk. If both,
textfile=filename and CD-Text information from *.inf or
*.cue files are present, textfile=filename will overwrite
the other information.</p>

<p>cuefile=filename Take all recording related information
from a CDRWIN compliant CUE sheet file. No track files are
allowed when this option is present and the option -dao is
currently needed in addition.</p>

<p>TRACK OPTIONS Track options may be mixed with track file
names.</p>

<p>isrc=ISRC_number Set the International Standard
Recording Number for the next track to ISRC_number.</p>

<p>index=list Sets an index list for the next track. In
index list is a comma separated list of numbers that are
counting from index 1. The first entry in this list must
contain a 0, the following numbers must be an ascending list
of numbers (counting in 1/75 seconds) that represent the
start of the indices. An index list in the form:
0,7500,15000 sets index 1 to the start of the track, index 2
100 seconds from the start of the track and index 3 200 sec-
onds from the start of the track.</p>

<p>-audio If this flag is present, all subsequent tracks
are written in CD-DA (similar to Red Book) audio format. The
file with data for this tracks should contain stereo, 16-bit
digital audio with 44100 samples/s. The byte order should be
the following: MSB left, LSB left, MSB right, LSB right, MSB
left and so on. The track should be a multiple of 2352
bytes. It is not possible to put the master image of an
audio track on a raw disk because data will be read in
multiple of 2352 bytes during the recording process.</p>

<p>If a filename ends in .au or .wav the file is considered
to be a structured audio data file. wodim assumes that the
file in this case is a Sun audio file or a Microsoft .WAV
file and extracts the audio data from the files by skipping
over the non-audio header information. In all other cases,
wodim will only work correctly if the audio data stream does
not have any header. Because many structured audio files do
not have an integral num- ber of blocks (1/75th second) in
length, it is often necessary to specify the -pad option as
well. wodim recognizes that audio data in a .WAV file is
stored in Intel (little-endian) byte order, and will
automatically byte-swap the data if the CD recorder requires
big-endian data. wodim will reject any audio file that does
not match the Red Book requirements of 16-bit stereo samples
in PCM coding at 44100 samples/second.</p>

<p>Using other structured audio data formats as input to
wodim will usually work if the structure of the data is the
structure described above (raw pcm data in big-endian byte
order). How- ever, if the data format includes a header, you
will hear a click at the start of a track.</p>

<p>If neither -data nor -audio have been specified, wodim
defaults to -audio for all filenames that end in .au or .wav
and to -data for all other files.</p>

<p>-swab If this flag is present, audio data is assumed to
be in byte- swapped (little-endian) order. Some types of
CD-Writers e.g. Yamaha, Sony and the new SCSI-3/mmc drives
require audio data to be presented in little-endian order,
while other writers require audio data to be presented in
the big-endian (network) byte order normally used by the
SCSI protocol. wodim knows if a CD- Recorder needs audio
data in big- or little-endian order, and corrects the byte
order of the data stream to match the needs of the recorder.
You only need the -swab flag if your data stream is in Intel
(little-endian) byte order.</p>

<p>Note that the verbose output of wodim will show you if
swapping is necessary to make the byte order of the input
data fit the required byte order of the recorder. wodim will
not show you if the -swab flag was actually present for a
track.</p>

<p>-data If this flag is present, all subsequent tracks are
written in CD-ROM mode 1 (Yellow Book) format. The data size
is a multiple of 2048 bytes. The file with track data should
contain an ISO-9660 or Rock Ridge filesystem image (see
genisoimage for more details). If the track data is an ufs
filesystem image, fragment size should be set to 2 KB or
more to allow CD-drives with 2 KB sector size to be used for
reading.</p>

<p>-data is the default, if no other flag is present and
the file does not appear to be of one of the well known
audio file types.</p>

<p>If neither -data nor -audio have been specified, wodim
defaults to -audio for all filenames that end in .au or .wav
and to -data for all other files.</p>

<p>-mode2 If this flag is present, all subsequent tracks
are written in CD-ROM mode 2 format. The data size is a
multiple of 2336 bytes.</p>

<p>-xa If this flag is present, all subsequent tracks are
written in CD-ROM XA mode 2 form 1 format. The data size is
a multiple of 2048 bytes. The XA sector sub headers will be
created by the drive. With this option, the write mode is
the same as with the -multi option.</p>

<p>-xa1 If this flag is present, all subsequent tracks are
written in CD-ROM XA mode 2 form 1 format. The data size is
a multiple of 2056 bytes. The XA sector sub headers are part
of the user data and have to be supplied by the application
that prepares the data to be written.</p>

<p>-xa2 If this flag is present, all subsequent tracks are
written in CD-ROM XA mode 2 form 2 format. The data is a
multiple of 2324 bytes. The XA sector sub headers will be
created by the drive.</p>

<p>-xamix If this flag is present, all subsequent tracks
are written in a way that allows a mix of CD-ROM XA mode 2
form 1/2 format. The data size is a multiple of 2332 bytes.
The XA sector sub head- ers are part of the user data and
have to be supplied by the application that prepares the
data to be written. The CRC and the P/Q parity ECC/EDC
information (depending on the sector type) have to be
supplied by the application that prepares the data to be
written.</p>

<p>-cdi If this flag is present, the TOC type for the disk
is set to CDI. This only makes sense with XA disks.</p>

<p>-isosize Use the ISO-9660 file system size as the size
of the next track. This option is needed if you want wodim
to directly read the image of a track from a raw disk
partition or from a TAO master CD. In the first case the
option -isosize is needed to limit the size of the CD to the
size of the ISO filesystem. In the second case the option
-isosize is needed to prevent wodim from reading the two run
out blocks that are appended by each CD-recorder in track at
once mode. These two run out blocks cannot be read and would
cause a buffer underrun that would cause a defective copy.
Do not use this option on files created by genisoimage and
in case wodim reads the track data from stdin. In the first
case, you would prevent wodim from writing the amount of
padding that has been appended by genisoimage and in the
latter case, it will not work because stdin is not
seekable.</p>

<p>If -isosize is used for a track, wodim will
automatically add padding for this track as if the -pad
option has been used but the amount of padding may be less
than the padding written by genisoimage. Note that if you
use -isosize on a track that con- tains Sparc boot
information, the boot information will be lost.</p>

<p>Note also that this option cannot be used to determine
the size of a file system if the multi session option is
present.</p>

<p>-pad If the track is a data track, 15 sectors of zeroed
data will be added to the end of this and each subsequent
data track. In this case, the -pad option is superseded by
the padsize= option. It will remain however as a shorthand
for padsize=15s. If the -pad option refers to an audio
track, wodim will pad the audio data to be a multiple of
2352 bytes. The audio data padding is done with binary
zeroes which is equal to absolute silence.</p>

<p>-pad remains valid until disabled by -nopad.</p>

<p>padsize=# Set the amount of data to be appended as
padding to the next track to #. Opposed to the behavior of
the -pad option, the value for padsize= is reset to zero for
each new track. wodim assumes a sector size of 2048 bytes
for the padsize= option, independent from the real sector
size and independent from the write mode. The megabytes
mentioned in the verbose mode output however are counting
the output sector size which is e.g. 2448 bytes when writing
in RAW/RAW96 mode. See fs= option for possi- ble arguments.
To pad the equivalent of 20 minutes on a CD, you may write
padsize=20x60x75s. Use this option if your CD-drive is not
able to read the last sectors of a track or if you want to
be able to read the CD on a Linux system with the ISO-9660
filesystem read ahead bug. If an empty file is used for
track data, this option may be used to create a disk that is
entirely made of padding. This may e.g. be used to find out
how much overburning is possible with a specific media.</p>

<p>-nopad Do not pad the following tracks - the
default.</p>

<p>-shorttrack Allow all subsequent tracks to violate the
Red Book track length standard which requires a minimum
track length of 4 seconds. This option is only useful when
used in SAO or RAW mode. Not all drives support this
feature. The drive must accept the resulting CUE sheet or
support RAW writing.</p>

<p>-noshorttrack Re-enforce the Red Book track length
standard. Tracks must be at least 4 seconds.</p>

<p>pregap=# Set the pre-gap size for the next track. This
option currently only makes sense with the TEAC drive when
creating track-at-once disks without the 2 second silence
before each track. This option may go away in future.</p>

<p>-preemp If this flag is present, all TOC entries for
subsequent audio tracks will indicate that the audio data
has been sampled with 50/15 microsec pre-emphasis. The data,
however is not modified during the process of transferring
from file to disk. This option has no effect on data
tracks.</p>

<p>-nopreemp If this flag is present, all TOC entries for
subsequent audio tracks will indicate that the audio data
has been mastered with linear data - this is the
default.</p>

<p>-copy If this flag is present, all TOC entries for
subsequent audio tracks of the resulting CD will indicate
that the audio data has permission to be copied without
limit. This option has no effect on data tracks.</p>

<p>-nocopy If this flag is present, all TOC entries for
subsequent audio tracks of the resulting CD will indicate
that the audio data has permission to be copied only once
for personal use - this is the default.</p>

<p>-scms If this flag is present, all TOC entries for
subsequent audio tracks of the resulting CD will indicate
that the audio data has no permission to be copied
anymore.</p>

<p>tsize=# If the master image for the next track has been
stored on a raw disk, use this option to specify the valid
amount of data on this disk. If the image of the next track
is stored in a regular file, the size of that file is taken
to determine the length of this track. If the track contains
an ISO 9660 filesystem image use the -isosize option to
determine the length of that filesys- tem image. In Disk at
Once mode and with some drives that use the TEAC pro-
gramming interface, even in Track at Once mode, wodim needs
to know the size of each track before starting to write the
disk. wodim now checks this and aborts before starting to
write. If this happens you will need to run genisoimage
-print-size before and use the output (with s appended) as
an argument to the tsize= option of wodim (e.g.
tsize=250000s). See fs= option for possible arguments.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES For all examples below, it will be assumed that
the CD/DVD-Recorder is connected to the primary SCSI bus of
the machine. The SCSI target id is set to 2.</p>

<p>To record a pure CD-ROM at double speed, using data from
the file cdim- age.raw:</p>

<p>wodim -v speed=2 dev=2,0 cdimage.raw</p>

<p>To create an image for a ISO 9660 filesystem with Rock
Ridge exten- sions:</p>

<p>genisoimage -R -o cdimage.raw
/home/joerg/master/tree</p>

<p>To check the resulting file before writing to CD on
Solaris:</p>

<p>mount -r -F fbk -o type=hsfs /dev/fbk0:cdimage.raw
/mnt</p>

<p>On Linux:</p>

<p>mount cdimage.raw -r -t iso9660 -o loop /mnt</p>

<p>Go on with: ls -lR /mnt umount /mnt</p>

<p>If the overall speed of the system is sufficient and the
structure of the filesystem is not too complex, wodim will
run without creating an image of the ISO 9660 filesystem.
Simply run the pipeline:</p>

<p>genisoimage -R /master/tree | wodim -v fs=6m speed=2
dev=2,0 -</p>

<p>The recommended minimum FIFO size for running this
pipeline is 4 MBytes. As the default FIFO size is 4 MB, the
fs= option needs only be present if you want to use a
different FIFO size. If your system is loaded, you should
run genisoimage in the real time class too. To raise the
priority of genisoimage replace the command</p>

<p>genisoimage -R /master/tree by priocntl -e -c RT -p 59
genisoimage -R /master/tree</p>

<p>on Solaris and by</p>

<p>nice --18 genisoimage -R /master/tree</p>

<p>on systems that don t have UNIX International compliant
real-time scheduling.</p>

<p>wodim runs at priority 59 on Solaris, you should run
genisoimage at no more than priority 58. On other systems,
you should run genisoimage at no less than nice --18.</p>

<p>Creating a CD-ROM without file system image on disk has
been tested on a Sparcstation-2 with a Yamaha CDR-400. It
did work up to quad speed when the machine was not loaded. A
faster machine may be able to han- dle quad speed also in
the loaded case.</p>

<p>To record a pure CD-DA (audio) at single speed, with
each track con- tained in a file named track01.cdaudio,
track02.cdaudio, etc:</p>

<p>wodim -v speed=1 dev=/dev/cdrw -audio track*.cdaudio</p>

<p>To check if it will be ok to use double speed for the
example above. Use the dummy write option:</p>

<p>wodim -v -dummy speed=2 dev=/dev/cdrw -audio
track*.cdaudio</p>

<p>To record a mixed-mode CD with an ISO 9660 filesystem
from cdimage.raw on the first track, the other tracks being
audio tracks from the files track01.cdaudio,
track02.cdaudio, etc:</p>

<p>wodim -v dev=2,0 cdimage.raw -audio track*.cdaudio</p>

<p>To handle drives that need to know the size of a track
before starting to write, first run</p>

<p>genisoimage -R -q -print-size /master/tree</p>

<p>and then run</p>

<p>genisoimage -R /master/tree | wodim speed=2 dev=2,0
tsize=XXXs -</p>

<p>where XXX is replaced by the output of the previous run
of genisoimage.</p>

<p>To copy an audio CD in the most accurate way, first
run</p>

<p>icedax dev=/dev/cdrom -vall cddb=0 -B -Owav</p>

<p>and then run</p>

<p>wodim dev=/dev/cdrw -v -dao -useinfo -text *.wav</p>

<p>This will try to copy track indices and to read CD-Text
information from disk. If there is no CD-Text information,
icedax will try to get the information from freedb.org
instead.</p>

<p>To copy an audio CD from a pipe (without intermediate
files), first run</p>

<p>icedax dev=1,0 -vall cddb=0 -info-only</p>

<p>and then run</p>

<p>icedax dev=1,0 -no-infofile -B -Oraw - | wodim dev=2,0
-v -dao -audio -useinfo -text *.inf</p>

<p>This will get all information (including track size
info) from the *.inf files and then read the audio data from
stdin.</p>

<p>If you like to write from stdin, make sure that wodim is
called with a large enough FIFO size (e.g. fs=128m), reduce
the write speed to a value below the read speed of the
source drive (e.g. speed=12), and get a CD/DVD drive with
BURN-Free feature if it is not available yet.</p>

<p>To set drive options without writing a CD (e.g. to
switch a drive to single session mode), run</p>

<p>wodim dev=1,0 -setdropts driveropts=singlesession</p>

<p>If you like to do this when no CD is in the drive,
call</p>

<p>wodim dev=1,0 -force -setdropts
driveropts=singlesession</p>

<p>To copy a CD in clone mode, first read the master CD
using:</p>

<p>readom dev=b,t,l -clone f=somefile</p>

<p>or (in case the CD contains many sectors that are
unreadable by inten- tion) by calling:</p>

<p>readom dev=1,0 -clone -nocorr f=somefile</p>

<p>will create the files somefile and somefile.toc. Then
write the CD using:</p>

<p>wodim dev=1,0 -raw96r -clone -v somefile</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT CDR_DEVICE This may either hold a device
identifier that is suitable to the open call of the SCSI
transport library or a label in the file
/etc/wodim.conf.</p>

<p>CDR_SPEED Sets the default speed value for writing (see
also speed= option).</p>

<p>CDR_FIFOSIZE Sets the default size of the FIFO (see also
fs=# option).</p>

<p>CDR_FORCERAWSPEED If this environment variable is set,
wodim will allow you to write at the full RAW encoding speed
a single CPU supports. This will create high potential of
buffer underruns. Use with care.</p>

<p>CDR_FORCESPEED If this environment variable is set,
wodim will allow you to write at the full DMA speed the
system supports. There is no DMA reserve for reading the
data that is to be written from disk. This will create high
potential of buffer underruns. Use with care.</p>

<p>RSH If the RSH environment is present, the remote
connection will not be created via rcmd(3) but by calling
the program pointed to by RSH. Use e.g. RSH=/usr/bin/ssh to
create a secure shell connection.</p>

<p>Note that this forces wodim to create a pipe to the
rsh(1) pro- gram and disallows wodim to directly access the
network socket to the remote server. This makes it
impossible to set up per- formance parameters and slows down
the connection compared to a root initiated rcmd(3)
connection.</p>

<p>RSCSI If the RSCSI environment is present, the remote
SCSI server will not be the program /opt/schily/sbin/rscsi
but the program pointed to by RSCSI. Note that the remote
SCSI server program name will be ignored if you log in using
an account that has been created with a remote SCSI server
program as login shell.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/wodim.conf Default values can be set for the
following options in /etc/wodim.conf. For example:
CDR_FIFOSIZE=8m or CDR_SPEED=2</p>

<p>CDR_DEVICE This may either hold a device identifier that
is suitable to the open call of the SCSI transport library
or a label in the file /etc/wodim.conf that allows to
identify a specific drive on the system.</p>

<p>CDR_SPEED Sets the default speed value for writing (see
also speed= option).</p>

<p>CDR_FIFOSIZE Sets the default size of the FIFO (see also
fs=# option).</p>

<p>CDR_MAXFIFOSIZE Sets the maximum size of the FIFO (see
also fs=# option).</p>

<p>Any other keyword (label) is an identifier (symbolic
name) for a specific drive on the system. Such an identifier
may not contain the characters ,, /, @ or :.</p>

<p>Each line that follows a label contains a whitespace
sep- arated list of items. Currently, four items are recog-
nized: the drives target specification, the default speed
that should be used for this drive, the default FIFO size
that should be used for this drive and drive specific
options. The values for speed and fifosize may be set to -1
to tell wodim to use the global defaults. target can be -1
to use the auto-guessing of the drive (see above).</p>

<p>The value for driveropts may be omitted or set to
&quot;&quot; if no driveropts are used. A typical line may
look this way:</p>

<p>plex760= 0,5,0 12 50m varirec=1</p>

<p>pioneer= /dev/hdd -1 -1</p>

<p>This tells wodim that a drive named plex760 is at
scsibus 0, target 5, lun 0 and should be used with speed 12
and a FIFO size of 50 MB. It also uses some device specific
parameter. A second drive may is accessible via the device
file /dev/hdd and uses the default speed and the default
FIFO size.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO icedax(1), readom(1), genisoimage(1),
ssh(1).</p>

<p>NOTES On Solaris you need to stop the volume management
if you like to use the USCSI fallback SCSI transport code.
Even things like wodim -scanbus will not work if the volume
management is running.</p>

<p>Disks made in Track At Once mode are not suitable as a
master for direct mass production by CD manufacturers. You
will need the disk at once option to record such disks.
Nevertheless the disks made in Track At Once will normally
be read in all CD players. Some old audio CD players however
may produce a two second click between two audio tracks.</p>

<p>The minimal size of a track is 4 seconds or 300 sectors.
If you write smaller tracks, the CD-Recorder will add dummy
blocks. This is not an error, even though the SCSI-error
message looks this way.</p>

<p>The Yamaha CDR-400 and all new SCSI-3/mmc conforming
drives are sup- ported in single and multi-session.</p>

<p>You should run several tests in all supported speeds of
your drive with the -dummy option turned on if you are using
wodim on an unknown sys- tem. Writing a CD is a real-time
process. NFS, CIFS and other network file systems wont
always deliver constantly the needed data rates. If you want
to use wodim with CD-images that are located on a NFS
mounted filesystem, be sure that the FIFO size is big
enough. If you want to make sure that buffer underruns are
not caused by your source disk, you may use the command</p>

<p>wodim -dummy dev=2,0 padsize=600m /dev/null</p>

<p>to create a disk that is entirely made of dummy
data.</p>

<p>There are also cases where you either need to be root or
install wodim executable with suid-root permissions. First,
if you are using a device manufactured before 1999 which
requires a non-MMC driver, you should run wodim in dummy
mode before writing data. If you find a problem doing this,
please report it to the cdrkit maintainers (see below).</p>

<p>Second, certain functionality may be unusable because of
Linuxs SCSI command filtering. When using wodim for anything
except of pure data writing, you should also test the
process in dummy mode and report trouble to the contact
address below.</p>

<p>If you still want to run wodim with root permissions,
you can set the permissions of the executable to suid-root.
See the additional notes of your system/program distribution
or README.suidroot which is part of the cdrkit source.</p>

<p>You should not connect old drives that do not support
disconnect/recon- nect to either the SCSI bus that is
connected to the CD-Recorder or the source disk.</p>

<p>A Compact Disc can have no more than 99 tracks.</p>

<p>When creating a disc with both audio and data tracks,
the data should be on track 1 otherwise you should create a
CDplus disk which is a multi session disk with the first
session containing the audio tracks and the following
session containing the data track.</p>

<p>Many operating systems are not able to read more than a
single data track, or need special software to do so.</p>

<p>If you have more information or SCSI command manuals for
currently unsupported CD/DVD/BR/HD-DVD-Recorders, please
contact the cdrkit main- tainers (see below).</p>

<p>Many CD recorders have bugs and often require a firmware
update to work correctly. If you experience problems which
cannot be solved or explained by the notes above, please
look for instructions on the home- page of the particular
manufacturer.</p>

<p>Some bugs will force you to power cycle the device or to
reboot the machine.</p>

<p>The FIFO percent output is computed just after a block
of data has been written to the CD/DVD-Recorder. For this
reason, there will never be 100% FIFO fill ratio while the
FIFO is in streaming mode.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS You have 4 seconds to abort wodim start
after you see the message:</p>

<p>Starting to write CD at speed %d in %s mode for %s
session. In most shells you can do that by pressing
Ctrl-C.</p>

<p>A typical error message for a SCSI command looks
like:</p>

<p>wodim: I/O error. test unit ready: scsi sendcmd: no
error CDB: 00 20 00 00 00 00 status: 0x2 (CHECK CONDITION)
Sense Bytes: 70 00 05 00 00 00 00 0A 00 00 00 00 25 00 00 00
00 00 Sense Key: 0x5 Illegal Request, Segment 0 Sense Code:
0x25 Qual 0x00 (logical unit not supported) Fru 0x0 Sense
flags: Blk 0 (not valid) cmd finished after 0.002s timeout
40s</p>

<p>The first line gives information about the transport of
the command. The text after the first colon gives the error
text for the system call from the view of the kernel. It
usually is: I/O error unless other problems happen. The next
words contain a short description for the SCSI command that
fails. The rest of the line tells you if there were any
problems for the transport of the command over the SCSI bus.
fatal error means that it was not possible to transport the
command (i.e. no device present at the requested SCSI
address).</p>

<p>The second line prints the SCSI command descriptor block
for the failed command.</p>

<p>The third line gives information on the SCSI status code
returned by the command, if the transport of the command
succeeds. This is error information from the SCSI
device.</p>

<p>The fourth line is a hex dump of the auto request sense
information for the command.</p>

<p>The fifth line is the error text for the sense key if
available, fol- lowed by the segment number that is only
valid if the command was a copy command. If the error
message is not directly related to the cur- rent command,
the text deferred error is appended.</p>

<p>The sixth line is the error text for the sense code and
the sense qual- ifier if available. If the type of the
device is known, the sense data is decoded from tables in
scsierrs.c . The text is followed by the error value for a
field replaceable unit.</p>

<p>The seventh line prints the block number that is related
to the failed command and text for several error flags. The
block number may not be valid.</p>

<p>The eight line reports the timeout set up for this
command and the time that the command really needed to
complete.</p>

<p>The following message is not an error:</p>

<p>Track 01: Total bytes read/written: 2048/2048 (1
sectors). wodim: I/O error. flush cache: scsi sendcmd: no
error CDB: 35 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 status: 0x2 (CHECK
CONDITION) Sense Bytes: F0 00 05 80 00 00 27 0A 00 00 00 00
B5 00 00 00 00 00 Sense Key: 0x5 Illegal Request, Segment 0
Sense Code: 0xB5 Qual 0x00 (dummy data blocks added) Fru 0x0
Sense flags: Blk -2147483609 (valid) cmd finished after
0.002s timeout 40s</p>

<p>It simply notifies, that a track that is smaller than
the minimum size has been expanded to 300 sectors.</p>

<p>BUGS netscsid does not work properly and is generally
unmaintained. It is probably not compatible with rscsi from
cdrtools either. Good bugfixes are welcome, talk to Cdrkit
maintainers.</p>

<p>cuefile support is very limited, only one file is
allowed. For volun- teers, see TODO file in the source.</p>

<p>Specifying an audio file multiple times causes
corruption of the second track (effectively no data plus
minimum padding).</p>

<p>Some of the bugs may be fixed in Joerg Schilling s
cdrtools. See there for details, URL attached below.</p>
