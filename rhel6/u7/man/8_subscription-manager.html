<p>NAME subscription-manager - Registers systems to a
subscription management service and then attaches and
manages subscriptions for software prod- ucts.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS subscription-manager command [options]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION subscription-manager is a client program
that registers a system with a subscription management
service such as the Customer Portal Subscrip- tion
Management service or on-premise Subscription Asset
Manager.</p>

<p>Red Hat provides content updates and support by issuing
subscriptions for its products. These subscriptions are
applied to systems; once a subscription for a product is
attached to a system, that system is allowed to install,
update, and receive support for that software prod- uct. IT
administrators need to track these subscriptions and how
they are attached. This subscription management is a feature
available for Red Hat platforms version 5.7 (and later) and
version 6.1 (and later).</p>

<p>For RHEL systems, content is delivered through the Red
Hat Customer Portal. Subscriptions and systems are managed
globally through the Red Hat subscription management
service, which is integrated with the Cus- tomer Portal.
Subscriptions are managed for the local system by using the
Red Hat Subscription Manager tool. Subscription Manager is a
local client which connects a system with the subscription
management ser- vice.</p>

<p>subscription-manager is the command-line based client
for the Red Hat Subscription Manager tool.</p>

<p>Subscription Manager performs several key
operations:</p>

<p>* It registers systems to the Red Hat subscription
management service and adds the system to the inventory.
Once a system is registered, it can receive updates based on
its subscriptions to any kind of software products.</p>

<p>* It lists both available and used subscriptions.</p>

<p>* It allows administrators to both attach specific
subscriptions to a system and remove those
subscriptions.</p>

<p>Subscription Manager can be used to auto-attach
subscriptions to a sys- tem, as well. The
subscription-manager command can even be invoked as part of
a kickstart process.</p>

<p>Available subscriptions are based on the specific
information about the systems architecture. A subscription
is only considered available if the platform and hardware
can support that specific product.</p>

<p>Subscription Manager also collects and summarizes system
facts related to its hardware, operating system, and other
characteristics. These facts can be edited in the
Subscription Manager configuration and dis- played through
Subscription Manager.</p>

<p>There is also a Subscription Manager GUI, which can be
invoked simply by running subscription-manager-gui from the
command line.</p>

<p>Subscription management is only available for RHEL
5.7/6.1 and later systems. Older systems should register to
Red Hat Network Classic using the rhn_register command.</p>

<p>COMMON OPTIONS -h, --help Prints the specific help
information for the given command.</p>

<p>--proxy=PROXY Uses an HTTP proxy. The PROXY name has the
format hostname:port.</p>

<p>--proxyuser=PROXYUSERNAME Gives the username to use to
authenticate to the HTTP proxy.</p>

<p>--proxypass=PROXYPASSWORD Gives the password to use to
authenticate to the HTTP proxy.</p>

<p>REGISTER OPTIONS The register command registers a new
system to the subscription manage- ment service.</p>

<p>--username=USERNAME Gives the username for the account
which is registering the sys- tem; this user account is
usually tied to the user account for the content delivery
system which supplies the content. Optional, for user-based
authentication.</p>

<p>--password=PASSWORD Gives the user account password.</p>

<p>--serverurl=SERVER_HOSTNAME Passes the name of the
subscription service with which to regis- ter the system.
The default value, if this is not given, is the Customer
Portal Subscription Management service, subscrip-
tion.rhn.redhat.com. If there is an on-premise subscription
service such as Subscription Asset Manager, this parameter
can be used to submit the hostname of the subscription
service. For Subscription Asset Manager, if the Subscription
Manager tool is configured with the Subscription Asset
Manager RPM, then the default value for the --serverurl
parameter is for the on- premise Subscription Asset Manager
server.</p>

<p>--baseurl=https://CONTENT_SERVICE:PORT/PREFIX Passes the
name of the content delivery service to configure the yum
service to use to pull down packages. If there is an on-
premise subscription service such as Subscription Asset
Manager or CloudForms System Engine, this parameter can be
used to sub- mit the URL of the content repository, in the
form https://server_name:port/prefix. For example,
https://sam.exam- ple.com:8088/sam.</p>

<p>--name=SYSTEM_NAME Sets the name of the system to
register. This defaults to the hostname.</p>

<p>--consumerid=CONSUMERID References an existing system
inventory ID to resume using a previous registration for
this system. The ID is used as an inventory number for the
system in the subscription management service database. If
the systems identity is lost or corrupted, this option
allows it to resume using its previous identity and
subscriptions.</p>

<p>--activationkey=KEYS Gives a comma-separated list of
product keys to use to redeem or apply specific
subscriptions to the system. This is used for preconfigured
systems which may already have products installed.
Activation keys are issued by an on-premise subscription
manage- ment service, such as Subscription Asset
Manager.</p>

<p>When the --activationkey option is used, it is not
necessary to use the --username and --password options,
because the authenti- cation information is implicit in the
activation key.</p>

<p>For example: subscription-manager register
--org=&quot;IT Dept&quot; --activationkey=1234abcd</p>

<p>--auto-attach Automatically attaches compatible
subscriptions to this system.</p>

<p>--servicelevel=LEVEL Sets the preferred service level to
use with subscriptions added to the system. Service levels
are commonly premium, standard, and none, though other
levels may be available depending on the product and the
contract.</p>

<p>--force Registers the system even if it is already
registered. Normally, any register operations will fail if
the system is already reg- istered. With --force, the
existing system entry is unregistered first, all of its
subscriptions are returned to the pool, and then the system
is registered as a new entry.</p>

<p>--org=ORG Assigns the system to an organization.
Infrastructures which are managed on-site may be
multi-tenant, meaning that there are mul- tiple
organizations within one customer unit. A system may be
assigned manually to one of these suborganizations. When a
sys- tem is registered with the Customer Portal, this is not
required. When a system is registered with an on-premise
appli- cation such as Subscription Asset Manager, this
argument is required, even if there is only a single
organization config- ured.</p>

<p>--environment=ENV Registers the system to an environment
within an organization.</p>

<p>--release=VERSION Shortcut for &quot;release
--set=VERSION&quot;</p>

<p>--type=CONSUMERTYPE Sets the type of unit to register.
Most units in the inventory will use the default value of
system. For development or test systems, this can be person
, which indicates a personal (rather than organizational)
subscription. Other systems can be can- dlepin for a local
content service or domain for an IP domain.</p>

<p>UNREGISTER OPTIONS The unregister command removes a
system s subscriptions and removes it from the subscription
management service.</p>

<p>This command has no options.</p>

<p>ATTACH OPTIONS The attach command applies a specific
subscription to the system.</p>

<p>--auto Automatically attaches the best-matched
compatible subscription or subscriptions to the system. This
is the default unless --pool or --file are used.</p>

<p>--pool=POOLID Gives the ID for the subscriptions pool
(collection of products) to attach to the system. This
overrides the default of --auto.</p>

<p>--file=FILE Specifies a file from which to read
whitespace-delimited pool IDs. If FILE is &quot;-&quot;, the
pool IDs will be read from stdin. This overrides the default
of --auto.</p>

<p>--quantity=NUMBER Attaches a specified number of
subscriptions to the system. Sub- scriptions may have
certain limits on them, like the number of sockets on the
system or the number of allowed virtual guests. It is
possible to attach multiple subscriptions (or stacking
subscriptions) to cover the number of sockets, guests, or
other characteristics.</p>

<p>--servicelevel=LEVEL Sets the preferred service level to
use with subscriptions auto- matically attached to the
system. Service levels are commonly premium, standard, and
none, though other levels may be avail- able depending on
the product and the contract. This option can- not be used
when attaching specific pools via --pool or --file.</p>

<p>AUTO-ATTACH OPTIONS The auto-attach command sets whether
the ability to check, attach, and update subscriptions
occurs automatically on the system. Auto-attaching
subscriptions checks the currently-installed products,
attached sub- scriptions, and any changes in available
subscriptions every four hours using the rhsmcertd
daemon.</p>

<p>--enable Enables the auto-attach option for the system.
If there is any change in the subscriptions for the system,
any subscriptions expire, or any new products are installed,
then subscription- manager detects the changes and
automatically attaches the appropriate subscriptions so that
the system remains covered.</p>

<p>--disable Disables the auto-attach option for the
system. If auto-attach is disabled, then any changes in
installed products or subscrip- tions for the system
(including expirations) must be addressed manually by the
administrator.</p>

<p>--show Shows whether auto-attach is enabled on the
systems.</p>

<p>REMOVE OPTIONS The remove command removes a subscription
from the system. (This does not uninstall the associated
products.)</p>

<p>--serial=SERIALNUMBER Gives the serial number of the
subscription certificate for the specific product to remove
from the system. Subscription cer- tificates attached to a
system are in a certificate, in
/etc/pki/entitlement/&lt;serial_number&gt;.pem. To remove
multiple subscriptions, use the --serial option multiple
times.</p>

<p>--all Removes all of the subscriptions attached to a
system.</p>

<p>RELEASE OPTIONS The release command sets a sticky OS
version to use when installing or updating packages. This
sets a preference for the minor version of the OS, such as
6.2 or 6.3. This can prevent unplanned or unsupported oper-
ating system version upgrades when an IT environment must
maintain a certified configuration.</p>

<p>--list Lists the available OS versions. If a release
preference is not set, then there is a message saying it is
not set.</p>

<p>--set=RELEASE Sets the minor (Y-stream) release version
to use, such as 6.3.</p>

<p>--unset Removes any previously set release version
preference.</p>

<p>servicelevel OPTIONS The servicelevel command displays
the current configured service level preference for products
installed on the system. For example, if the service-level
preference is standard, then a subscription with a stan-
dard service level is selected when auto-attaching
subscriptions to the system.</p>

<p>The servicelevel command does not set the service level
for the system; it only shows its current setting or
available settings. The service-level preference must be set
in the Subscription Manager GUI.</p>

<p>--list Lists the available service levels.</p>

<p>--show Shows the system s current service-level
preference. If a ser- vice level is not set, then there is a
message saying it is not set.</p>

<p>--unset Removes any previously set service-level
preference.</p>

<p>IMPORT OPTIONS The import command imports and applies a
subscription certificate for the system which was generated
externally, such as in the Customer Por- tal, and then
copied over to the system. Importing can be necessary if a
system is preconfigured in the subscription management
service or if it is offline or unable to access the
subscription management service but it has the proper,
relevant subscriptions attached to the system.</p>

<p>--certificate=CERTIFICATE_FILE Points to a certificate
PEM file which contains the subscription certificate. This
can be used multiple times to import multiple subscription
certificates.</p>

<p>REDEEM OPTIONS The redeem command is used for systems
that are purchased from third- party vendors that include a
subscription. The redemption process essentially
auto-attaches the preselected subscription that the vendor
supplied to the system.</p>

<p>--email=EMAIL Gives the email account to send the
redemption notification mes- sage to.</p>

<p>--locale=LOCALE Sets the locale to use for the message.
If none is given, then it defaults to the local systems
locale.</p>

<p>--org=ORG Identifies the organization which issued the
subscription being redeemed.</p>

<p>LIST OPTIONS The list command lists all of the
subscriptions that are compatible with a system. The options
allow the list to be filtered by subscrip- tions that are
used by the system or unused subscriptions that are
available to the system.</p>

<p>--all Lists all possible subscriptions that have been
purchased, even if they dont match the architecture of the
system. This is used with the --available option.</p>

<p>--available Lists available subscriptions which are not
yet attached to the system.</p>

<p>--consumed Lists all of the subscriptions currently
attached to the system.</p>

<p>--installed Lists products which are currently installed
on the system which may (or may not) have subscriptions
associated with them, as well as products with attached
subscriptions which may (or may not) be installed.</p>

<p>--ondate=YYYY-MM-DD Sets the date to use to search for
active and available sub- scriptions. The default (if not
explicitly passed) is todays date; using a later date looks
for subscriptions which will be active then. This is only
used with the --available option.</p>

<p>--no-overlap Shows pools which provide products that are
not already covered; only used with --available option.</p>

<p>--match-installed Shows only subscriptions matching
products that are currently installed; only used with
--available option.</p>

<p>--matches=SEARCH Limits the output of --installed,
--available and --consumed to only subscriptions or products
which contain SEARCH in the sub- scription or product
information, varying with the list requested and the server
version. SEARCH may contain the wildcards ? or * to match a
single char- acter or zero or more characters, respectively.
The wildcard characters may be escaped with a backslash to
represent a lit- eral question mark or asterisk. Likewise,
to represent a back- slash, it must be escaped with another
backslash.</p>

<p>--pool-only Limits the output of --available and
--consumed such that only the pool IDs are displayed. No
labels or errors will be printed if this option is
specified.</p>

<p>REFRESH OPTIONS The refresh command pulls the latest
subscription data from the server. Normally, the system
polls the subscription management service at a set interval
(4 hours by default) to check for any changes in the
available subscriptions. The refresh command checks with the
subscription manage- ment service right then, outside the
normal interval.</p>

<p>This command has no options.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENTS OPTIONS The environments command lists all
of the environments that have been configured for an
organization. This command is only used for organiza- tions
which have a locally-hosted subscription or content service
of some kind, like Subscription Asset Manager. The concept
of environments -- and therefore this command -- have no
meaning for environments which use the Customer Portal
Subscription Management services.</p>

<p>--username=USERNAME Gives the username for the account
to use to connect to the organization account.</p>

<p>--password=PASSWORD Gives the user account password.</p>

<p>--org=ORG Identifies the organization for which to list
the configured environments.</p>

<p>REPOS OPTIONS The repos command lists all of the
repositories that are available to a system. This command is
only used for organizations which have a locally-hosted
content service of some kind, like Subscription Asset
Manager. With Red Hats hosted content service, there is only
one cen- tral repository.</p>

<p>--list Lists all of the repositories that are provided
by the content service used by the system.</p>

<p>--list-enabled Lists all of the enabled repositories
that are provided by the content service used by the
system.</p>

<p>--list-disabled Lists all of the disabled repositories
that are provided by the content service used by the
system.</p>

<p>--enable=REPO_ID Enables the specified repository, which
is made available by the content sources identified in the
system subscriptions. To enable multiple repositories, use
this argument multiple times.</p>

<p>--disable=REPO_ID Disables the specified repository,
which is made available by the content sources identified in
the system subscriptions. To disable multiple repositories,
use this argument multiple times.</p>

<p>ORGS OPTIONS The orgs command lists all of the
organizations which are available to the specified user
account. A multi-tenant infrastructure may have multiple
organizations within a single customer, and users may be
restricted to access only a subset of the total number of
organiza- tions.</p>

<p>--username=USERNAME Gives the username for the account
to use to connect to the organization account.</p>

<p>--password=PASSWORD Gives the user account password.</p>

<p>--serverurl=SERVER_HOSTNAME Passes the name of the
subscription service to use to list all available
organizations. The orgs command will list all organi-
zations for the specified service for which the user account
is granted access. The default value, if this is not given,
is the Customer Portal Subscription Management service,
https://sub- scription.rhn.redhat.com:443. If there is an
on-premise sub- scription service such as Subscription Asset
Manager, this parameter can be used to submit the hostname
of the subscription service, in the form
[protocol://]servername[:port][/prefix]. For Subscription
Asset Manager, if the Subscription Manager tool is
configured with the Subscription Asset Manager RPM, then the
default value for the --serverurl parameter is for the on-
premise Subscription Asset Manager server.</p>

<p>PLUGIN OPTIONS The plugins command lists the available
subscription-manager plugins.</p>

<p>--list List the available subscription-manager
plugins.</p>

<p>--listslots List the available plugin slots</p>

<p>--listhooks List the available plugin slots and the
hooks that handle them.</p>

<p>--verbose Show additional info about the plugins, such
as the plugin con- figuration values.</p>

<p>REPO-OVERRIDE OPTIONS The repo-override command allows
the user to manage custom content repository settings</p>

<p>--repo The repository to modify (can be specified more
than once)</p>

<p>--add=NAME:VALUE Adds a named override with the provided
value to repositories specified with the --repo option</p>

<p>--remove=NAME Removes a named override from the
repositories specified with the --repo option</p>

<p>--remove-all Removes all overrides from repositories
specified with the --repo option</p>

<p>--list Lists all overrides from repositories specified
with the --repo option</p>

<p>IDENTITY OPTIONS The identity command handles the UUID
of a system, which identifies the system to the subscription
management service after registration. This command can
simply return the UUID or it can be used to restore the
registration of a previously-registered system to the
subscription man- agement service.</p>

<p>--regenerate Requests that the subscription management
service issue a new identity certificate for the system,
using an existing UUID in the original identity certificate.
If this is used alone, then the identity command also uses
the original identity certificate to bind to the
subscription management service, using certifi- cate-based
authentication.</p>

<p>--username=USERNAME Gives the username for the account
which is registering the sys- tem; this user account is
usually tied to the user account for the content delivery
system which supplies the content. Optional, for user-based
authentication.</p>

<p>--password=PASSWORD Gives the user account password.
Optional, for user-based authentication.</p>

<p>--force Regenerates the identity certificate for the
system using user- name/password authentication. This is
used with the --regenerate option. --regenerate alone will
use an existing identity cer- tificate to authenticate to
the subscription management service. If the certificate is
missing or corrupted or in other circum- stances, then it
may be better to use user authentication rather than
certificate-based authentication. In that case, the --force
option requires the username or password to be given either
as an argument or in response to a prompt.</p>

<p>FACTS OPTIONS The facts command lists the system
information, like the release ver- sion, number of CPUs, and
other architecture information.</p>

<p>--list Lists the system information. These are simple
attribute: value pairs that reflect much of the information
in the /etc/sysconfig directory cpu.architecture: x86_64
cpu.core(s)_per_socket: 1 cpu.cpu(s): 2 cpu.cpu_family: 6
cpu.cpu_mhz: 1861.776 cpu.cpu_op-mode(s): 64-bit
cpu.cpu_socket(s): 2 cpu.hypervisor_vendor: KVM cpu.model: 2
cpu.numa_node(s): 1 cpu.numa_node0_cpu(s): 0,1 cpu.stepping:
3 cpu.thread(s)_per_core: 1 cpu.vendor_id: GenuineIntel
cpu.virtualization_type: full distribution.id: Santiago
distribution.name: Red Hat Enterprise Linux Workstation
distribution.version: 6.1 ----</p>

<p>--update Updates the system information. This is
particularly important whenever there is a hardware change
(such as adding a CPU) or a system upgrade because these
changes can affect the subscrip- tions that are compatible
with the system.</p>

<p>CLEAN OPTIONS The clean command removes all of the
subscription and identity data from the local system without
affecting the system information in the subscription
management service. This means that any of the subscrip-
tions applied to the system are not available for other
systems to use. The clean command is useful in cases where
the local subscription information is corrupted or lost
somehow, and the system will be rereg- istered using the
register --consumerid=EXISTING_ID command.</p>

<p>This command has no options.</p>

<p>CONFIG OPTIONS The config command changes the rhsm.conf
configuration file used by Subscription Manager. Almost all
of the connection information used by Subscription Manager
to access the subscription management service, content
server, and any proxies is set in the configuration file, as
well as general configuration parameters like the frequency
Subscrip- tion Manager checks for subscriptions updates.
There are major divi- sions in the rhsm.conf file, such as
[server] which is used to config- ure the subscription
management service. When changing the Subscription Manager
configuration, the settings are identified with the format
sec- tion.name and then the new value. For example:</p>

<p>server.hostname=newsubscription.example.com</p>

<p>--list Prints the current configuration for Subscription
Manager.</p>

<p>--remove=section.name Deletes the current value for the
parameter without supplying a new parameter. A blank value
tells Subscription Manager to use service default values for
that parameter. If there are no defaults, then the feature
is ignored.</p>

<p>--section.name=VALUE Sets a parameter to a new,
specified value. This is commonly used for connection
settings:</p>

<p>* server.hostname (subscription management service)</p>

<p>* server.proxy</p>

<p>* server.proxy_port</p>

<p>* server.proxy_user</p>

<p>* server.proxy_password</p>

<p>* rhsm.baseurl (content server)</p>

<p>* rhsm.certFrequency</p>

<p>VERSION OPTIONS The version command displays information
about the current Subscription Manager package, the
subscription service the system is registered to (if it is
currently registered), and the subscription management
server that the system is configured to use. For
example:</p>

<p>[root@server ~]# subscription-manager version server
type: Red Hat Subscription Management subscription
management server: 0.9.18-1 subscription management rules:
5.9 subscription-manager: 1.12.1-1.git.28.5cd97a5.fc20
python-rhsm: 1.11.4-1.git.1.2f38ded.fc20</p>

<p>This command has no options.</p>

<p>STATUS OPTIONS The status command shows the current
status of the products and attached subscriptions for the
system. If some products are not fully covered or
subscriptions have expired, then the status command shows
why subscriptions are not current and returns an error
code.</p>

<p>[root@server ~]# subscription-manager status
+-------------------------------------------+ System Status
Details +-------------------------------------------+
Overall Status: Current</p>

<p>--ondate=DATE Shows the system status for a specific
date in the future. The format of the date is
YYYY-MM-DD.</p>

<p>[root@server ~]# subscription-manager status
--ondate=2014-01-01
+-------------------------------------------+ System Status
Details +-------------------------------------------+
Overall Status: Insufficient</p>

<p>DEPRECATED COMMANDS As the structures of subscription
configuration have changed, some of the original management
commands have become obsolete. These commands have been
replaced with updated commands.</p>

<p>subscribe This has been replaced with attach. A similar
registration option, --subscribe, has also be replaced with
--auto-attach.</p>

<p>unsubscribe This has been replaced with remove.</p>

<p>activate This has been replaced with redeem.</p>

<p>USAGE subscription-manager has two major tasks:</p>

<p>1. Handling the registration for a given system to a
subscrip- tion management service</p>

<p>2. Handling the product subscriptions for installed
products on a system</p>

<p>subscription-manager makes it easier for network
administrators to maintain parity between software
subscriptions and updates and their installed products by
tracking and managing what subscriptions are attached to a
system and when those subscriptions expire or are
exceeded.</p>

<p>REGISTERING AND UNREGISTERING MACHINES A system is
either registered to a subscription management service --
which makes all of the subscriptions available to the system
-- or it is not registered. Unregistered systems necessarily
lack valid software subscriptions because there is no way to
record that the subscriptions have been used nor any way to
renew them.</p>

<p>The default subscription management service in the
Subscription Manager configuration is the Customer Portal
Subscription Management service. The configuration file can
be edited before the system is registered to point to an
on-premise subscription management service like Subscrip-
tion Asset Manager.</p>

<p>Systems are usually registered to a subscription
management service as part of their initial configuration,
such as the firstboot or kickstart process. However, systems
can be registered manually after they are configured, can be
removed from a content service, or reregistered.</p>

<p>If a system has never been registered (not even during
firstboot), then the register command will register the
system with whatever subscrip- tion management service is
configured in the /etc/rhsm/rhsm.conf file. This command
requires, at a minimum, the username and password for an
account to connect to the subscription management service.
If the cre- dentials aren t passed with the command, then
subscription-manager prompts for the username and password
interactively.</p>

<p>When there is a single organization or when using the
Customer Portal Subscription Management service, all that is
required is the user- name/password set. For example:</p>

<p>subscription-manager register --username=admin
--password=secret</p>

<p>With on-premise subscription services, such as
Subscription Asset Man- ager, the infrastructure is more
complex. The local administrator can define independent
groups called organizations which represent physical or
organizational divisions (--org). Those organizations can be
subdi- vided into environments (--environment). Optionally,
the information about what subscription service
(--serverurl) and content delivery net- work (--baseurl) to
use for the system registration can also be passed (which
overrides the Red Hat Subscription Manager settings). The
server and content URLs are usually configured in the
Subscription Manager configuration before registering a
system.</p>

<p>subscription-manager register --username=admin
--password=secret --org=&quot;IT Dept&quot;
--environment=&quot;local dev&quot;
--serverurl=local-cloudforms.example.com
--baseurl=https://local-cloudforms.example.com:8088/cfFe</p>

<p>If a system is in a multi-tenant environment and the
organization is not provided with the registration request,
registration fails with a remote server error. In the
rhsm.log, there will be errors about being unable to load
the owners interface.</p>

<p>Some information is assigned automatically. Subscription
Manager auto- matically generates a unique ID for the system
which is used by the subscription management service and it
assigns a unit type, which indi- cates what kinds of
software are available for the system. The name for the
entry can be manually assigned (for use within an on-premise
sub- scription service, for instance). A handful of
subscriptions (such as specialized servers for content or
identity management) have their own specific unit type. For
example:</p>

<p>subscription-manager register --username=admin
--password=secret --type=system --name=server1
--org=&quot;IT Dept&quot;</p>

<p>If a system is registered and then somehow its
subscription information is lost -- a drive crashes or the
certificates are deleted or corrupted -- the system can be
reregistered, with all of its subscriptions restored, by
registering with the existing ID.</p>

<p>subscription-manager register --username=admin
--password=secret --consumerid=1234abcd</p>

<p>A system uses an SSL client certificate (its identity
certificate) to authenticate to the subscriptions system to
check for updates or changes to subscriptions. If the
identity certificate is lost or cor- rupted, it can be
regenerated using the identity command.</p>

<p>subscription-manager identity --regenerate</p>

<p>Using the --force option will prompt for the username
and password for the account, if one isnt given, and then
return the new inventory ID and the hostname of the
registered system.</p>

<p>subscription-manager identity --force Username: jsmith
Password: eff9a4c9-3579-49e5-a52f-83f2db29ab52
server.example.com</p>

<p>A system is unregistered and removed from the
subscription management service simply by running the
unregister command. Unregistering a sys- tem and removing
its attached subscriptions can free up subscriptions when a
system is taken offline or moved to a different
department.</p>

<p>subscription-manager unregister</p>

<p>An option with registration, --auto-attach, will
automatically attach the subscriptions pool which best
matches the system architecture and configuration to the
newly-registered system. This option attaches sub-
scriptions as part of the registration process, rather than
separately managing subscriptions.</p>

<p>subscription-manager register --username=admin
--password=secret --auto-attach</p>

<p>Auto-attach also supports an option to set a preferred
service level with the selected subscriptions, the
--servicelevel option. In this case, the --servicelevel
option sets a preference that helps the auto- attach process
select appropriate subscriptions. For example, if the
preferred service level for a production server is premium,
and there are three matching subscriptions with different
service levels (none, standard, and premium), the
auto-attach process selects the subscrip- tion which offers
a premium service level.</p>

<p>subscription-manager register --username=admin
--password=secret --auto-attach --servicelevel=premium</p>

<p>LISTING, ATTACHING, AND REMOVING SUBSCRIPTIONS FOR
PRODUCTS A subscription is essentially the right to install,
use, and receive updates for a Red Hat product. (Sometimes
multiple individual software products are bundled together
into a single subscription.) When a sys- tem is registered,
the subscription management service is aware of the system
and has a list of all of the possible product subscriptions
that the system can install and use. A subscription is
applied to a system when the system is attached to the
subscription pool that makes that product available. A
system releases or removes that subscription (meaning, it
removes that subscription so that another system can use
that subscription count).</p>

<p>list command shows you what subscriptions are available
specifically to the system (meaning subscriptions which are
active, have available quantities, and match the hardware
and architecture) or all subscrip- tions for the
organization. Using the --ondate option shows subscrip-
tions that are or will be active at a specific time
(otherwise, it shows subscriptions which are active
today).</p>

<p>subscription-manager list --available
--ondate=2012-01-31
+-------------------------------------------+ Available
Subscriptions +-------------------------------------------+
Subscription Name: Red Hat Enterprise Linux SKU: SYS0395

Service Level: None Service Type: None Multi-Entitlement: No
Ends: 01/01/2022 Machine Type: physical</p>

<p>The list command can also be used to show what products
you currently have installed, as a way of tracking what
products you have versus what subscriptions you have on the
system.</p>

<p>subscription-manager list --installed</p>

<p>+-------------------------------------------+ Installed

69 Version: 6.3 Arch: x86_64 Status: Subscribed Started:
07/26/2012 Ends: 08/31/2015</p>

<p>The list can be filtered to only include products or
subscriptions that match the query string provided to
--matches option.</p>

<p>subscription-manager list --instaled
--matches=&quot;*Server*&quot;</p>

<p>ProductName: Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server Product ID:
69 Version: 6.3 Arch: x86_64 Status: Subscribed Started:

<p>Attaching a subscription requires the ID for the
subscription pool (the --pool option). For example:</p>

<p>subscription-manager attach
--pool=ff8080812bc382e3012bc3845da100d2</p>

<p>As with the register command, the system can be
auto-attached to the best-fitting subscriptions. This is the
default action and is equi- livent to using the --auto
option:</p>

<p>subscription-manager attach</p>

<p>Auto-attach also supports an option to set a preferred
service level with the selected subscriptions, the
--servicelevel option. In this case, the --servicelevel
option sets a preference that helps the auto- attach process
select appropriate subscriptions. For example, if the
preferred service level for a production server is premium,
and there are three matching subscriptions with different
service levels (none, standard, and premium), the
auto-attach process selects the subscrip- tion which offers
a premium subscription.</p>

<p>subscription-manager attach --servicelevel=premium</p>

<p>Some subscriptions define a count based on attributes of
the system itself, like the number of sockets or the number
of virtual guests on a host. You can combine multiple
subscriptions together to cover the count. For example, if
there is a four socket server, you can use two subscriptions
for &quot;RHEL Server for Two Sockets&quot; to cover the
socket count. To specify the number of subscriptions to use,
use the --quan- tity option. For example:</p>

<p>subscription-manager attach
--pool=ff8080812bc382e3012bc3845da100d2 --quantity=2</p>

<p>Removing subscription from a system releases the
subscription back into the pool. The system remains
registered with the subscription manage- ment service. Each
product has an identifying X.509 certificate installed with
it. To remove a subscription for a specific product, specify
the serial number (or numbers, in multiple --serial options)
of the certificate:</p>

<p>subscription-manager remove
--serial=1128750306742160</p>

<p>Giving the remove command with the --all option removes
every subscrip- tion the system has used.</p>

<p>REDEEMING EXISTING SUBSCRIPTIONS Sometimes, a system may
come preconfigured with products and subscrip- tions. Rather
than attaching a pool and claiming a subscription, this
system simply needs to redeem its existing
subscriptions.</p>

<p>After registration, subscriptions on preconfigured
systems can be claimed using the redeem command, which
essentially auto-attaches the system to its preexisting
subscriptions.</p>

<p>subscription-manager redeem --email=admin@example.com
--org=&quot;IT Dept&quot;</p>

<p>VIEWING LOCAL SUBSCRIPTION &amp; CONTENT PROVIDER
INFORMATION Red Hat has a hosted environment, through the
Customer Portal, that provides centralized access to
subscription management and content repositories. However,
organizations can use other tools -- like Sub- scription
Manager -- for content hosting and subscription management.
With a local content provider, the organization,
environments, reposi- tories, and other structural
configuration is performed in the content provider. Red Hat
Subscription Manager can be used to display this
information, using the environments, orgs, and repos
commands.</p>

<p>subscription-manager repos --list</p>

<p>subscription-manager environments --username=jsmith
--password=secret --org=prod</p>

<p>subscription-manager orgs --username=jsmith
--password=secret</p>

<p>CHANGING SUBSCRIPTION MANAGER CONFIGURATION The
Subscription Manager CLI and GUI both use the
/etc/rhsm/rhsm.conf file for configuration, including what
content and subscription manage- ment services to use and
management settings like auto-attaching. This configuration
file can be edited directly, or it can be edited using the
config command. Parameters and values are passed as
arguments with the config command in the format
--section.parameter=value , where sec- tion is the
configuration section in the file: server, rhsm, or rhsm-
certd.</p>

<p>For example, to change the hostname of the subscription
management ser- vice host:</p>

<p>subscription-manager config
--server.hostname=myserver.example.com</p>

<p>UPDATING FACTS The information about a system, such as
its hardware and CPU, its oper- ating system versions, and
memory, are collected by Subscription Man- ager in a list of
facts. Subscription Manager uses these facts to determine
what purchased subscriptions are compatible with the system.
Whenever these facts change (such as installing an
additional CPU), the facts can be updated immediately using
the facts command.</p>

<p>subscription-manager facts --update</p>

<p>The collected facts can also be overridden by creating a
JSON file in the /etc/rhsm/facts/ directory. These have
simple formats that define a fact and value:</p>

<p>{&quot;fact1&quot;:
&quot;value1&quot;,&quot;fact2&quot;:
&quot;value2&quot;}</p>

<p>Any fact override file must have a .facts extension.</p>

<p>When these fact files are added, running the facts
command will update the collected facts with the new, manual
facts or values.</p>

<p>SUBSCRIPTIONS AND KICKSTART The subscription-manager
tool can be run as a post-install script as part of the
kickstart installation process. This allows subscription
management (registering and applying subscriptions) to be
automated along with installation. For example:</p>

<p>%post --log=/root/ks-post.log
/usr/sbin/subscription-manager register --username admin
--password secret --org east colo --auto-attach
--servicelevel=premium --force</p>

<p>NETWORK INFORMATION The subscription-manager tool uses
outgoing HTTPS requests. In the default configuration it
will use HTTPS on port 443 to the subscription servers
subscription.rhn.redhat.com and to the content delivery
service cdn.redhat.com.</p>

subscription-manager and the subscription-manager yum plugin
