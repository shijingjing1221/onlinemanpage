<p>NAME idmap_adex - Samba&rsquo;s idmap_adex Backend for
Winbind</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The idmap_adex plugin provides a way for
Winbind to read id mappings from an AD server that uses
RFC2307 schema extensions. This module implements both the
idmap and nss_info APIs and supports domain trustes as well
as two-way cross forest trusts. It is a read-only plugin
requiring that the administrator provide mappings in advance
by adding the POSIX attribute information to the users and
groups objects in AD. The most common means of doing this is
using &quot;Identity Services for Unix&quot; support on
Windows 2003 R2 and later.</p>

<p>Note that you must add the uidNumber, gidNumber, and uid
attributes to the partial attribute set of the forest global
catalog servers. This can be done using the Active Directory
Schema Management MMC plugin (schmmgmt.dll).</p>

<p>NSS_INFO The nss_info plugin supports reading the
unixHomeDirectory, gidNumber, loginShell, and uidNumber
attributes from the user object and the gidNumber attribute
from the group object to fill in information required by the
libc getpwnam() and getgrnam() family of functions. Group
membership is filled in according to the Windows group
membership and not the msSFU30PosixMember attribute.</p>

<p>Username aliases are implement by setting the uid
attribute on the user object. While group name aliases are
implemented by reading the displayname attribute from the
group object.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES The following example shows how to retrieve
idmappings and NSS data from our principal and trusted AD
domains.</p>

<p>[global] idmap config * : backend = adex idmap config *
: range = 1000-4000000000</p>

<p>winbind nss info = adex winbind normalize names =
yes</p>

<p>AUTHOR The original Samba software and related utilities
were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by
the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way
the Linux kernel is developed.</p>
