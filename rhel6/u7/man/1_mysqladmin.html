<p>NAME mysqladmin - client for administering a MySQL
server</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS mysqladmin [options] command [command-options]
[command [command-options]] ...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION mysqladmin is a client for performing
administrative operations. You can use it to check the
server&rsquo;s configuration and current status, to create
and drop databases, and more.</p>

<p>Invoke mysqladmin like this:</p>

<p>shell&gt; mysqladmin [options] command [command-arg]
[command [command-arg]] ...</p>

<p>mysqladmin supports the following commands. Some of the
commands take an argument following the command name.</p>

<p>&middot; create db_name</p>

<p>Create a new database named db_name.</p>

<p>&middot; debug</p>

<p>Tell the server to write debug information to the error
log. Format and content of this information is subject to
change.</p>

<p>Beginning with MySQL 5.1.12, this includes information
about the Event Scheduler. See Section 19.4.5, Event
Scheduler Status.</p>

<p>&middot; drop db_name</p>

<p>Delete the database named db_name and all its
tables.</p>

<p>&middot; extended-status</p>

<p>Display the server status variables and their
values.</p>

<p>&middot; flush-hosts</p>

<p>Flush all information in the host cache.</p>

<p>&middot; flush-logs</p>

<p>Flush all logs.</p>

<p>&middot; flush-privileges</p>

<p>Reload the grant tables (same as reload).</p>

<p>&middot; flush-status</p>

<p>Clear status variables.</p>

<p>&middot; flush-tables</p>

<p>Flush all tables.</p>

<p>&middot; flush-threads</p>

<p>Flush the thread cache.</p>

<p>&middot; kill id,id,...</p>

<p>Kill server threads. If multiple thread ID values are
given, there must be no spaces in the list.</p>

<p>&middot; old-password new-password</p>

<p>This is like the password command but stores the
password using the old (pre-4.1) password-hashing format.
(See Section 6.1.2.4, Password Hashing in MySQL.)</p>

<p>&middot; password new-password</p>

<p>Set a new password. This changes the password to
new-password for the account that you use with mysqladmin
for connecting to the server. Thus, the next time you invoke
mysqladmin (or any other client program) using the same
account, you will need to specify the new password.</p>

<p>If the new-password value contains spaces or other
characters that are special to your command interpreter, you
need to enclose it within quotation marks. On Windows, be
sure to use double quotation marks rather than single
quotation marks; single quotation marks are not stripped
from the password, but rather are interpreted as part of the
password. For example:</p>

<p>shell&gt; mysqladmin password &quot;my new
password&quot;</p>

<p>Caution Do not use this command used if the server was
started with the --skip-grant-tables option. No password
change will be applied. This is true even if you precede the
password command with flush-privileges on the same command
line to re-enable the grant tables because the flush
operation occurs after you connect. However, you can use
mysqladmin flush-privileges to re-enable the grant table and
then use a separate mysqladmin password command to change
the password.</p>

<p>&middot; ping</p>

<p>Check whether the server is available. The return status
from mysqladmin is 0 if the server is running, 1 if it is
not. This is 0 even in case of an error such as Access
denied, because this means that the server is running but
refused the connection, which is different from the server
not running.</p>

<p>&middot; processlist</p>

<p>Show a list of active server threads. This is like the
output of the SHOW PROCESSLIST statement. If the --verbose
option is given, the output is like that of SHOW FULL
PROCESSLIST. (See Section 13.7.5.31, SHOW PROCESSLIST
Syntax.)</p>

<p>&middot; reload</p>

<p>Reload the grant tables.</p>

<p>&middot; refresh</p>

<p>Flush all tables and close and open log files.</p>

<p>&middot; shutdown</p>

<p>Stop the server.</p>

<p>&middot; start-slave</p>

<p>Start replication on a slave server.</p>

<p>&middot; status</p>

<p>Display a short server status message.</p>

<p>&middot; stop-slave</p>

<p>Stop replication on a slave server.</p>

<p>&middot; variables</p>

<p>Display the server system variables and their
values.</p>

<p>&middot; version</p>

<p>Display version information from the server.</p>

<p>All commands can be shortened to any unique prefix. For
example:</p>

<p>shell&gt; mysqladmin proc stat
+----+-------+-----------+----+---------+------+-------+------------------+
| Id | User | Host | db | Command | Time | State | Info |
+----+-------+-----------+----+---------+------+-------+------------------+
| 51 | monty | localhost | | Query | 0 | | show processlist
|
+----+-------+-----------+----+---------+------+-------+------------------+
Uptime: 1473624 Threads: 1 Questions: 39487 Slow queries: 0
Opens: 541 Flush tables: 1 Open tables: 19 Queries per
second avg: 0.0268</p>

<p>The mysqladmin status command result displays the
following values:</p>

<p>&middot; Uptime</p>

<p>The number of seconds the MySQL server has been
running.</p>

<p>&middot; Threads</p>

<p>The number of active threads (clients).</p>

<p>&middot; Questions</p>

<p>The number of questions (queries) from clients since the
server was started.</p>

<p>&middot; Slow queries</p>

<p>The number of queries that have taken more than
long_query_time seconds. See Section 5.2.5, The Slow Query
Log.</p>

<p>&middot; Opens</p>

<p>The number of tables the server has opened.</p>

<p>&middot; Flush tables</p>

<p>The number of flush-*, refresh, and reload commands the
server has executed.</p>

<p>&middot; Open tables</p>

<p>The number of tables that currently are open.</p>

<p>&middot; Memory in use</p>

<p>The amount of memory allocated directly by mysqld. This
value is displayed only when MySQL has been compiled with
--with-debug=full.</p>

<p>&middot; Maximum memory used</p>

<p>The maximum amount of memory allocated directly by
mysqld. This value is displayed only when MySQL has been
compiled with --with-debug=full.</p>

<p>If you execute mysqladmin shutdown when connecting to a
local server using a Unix socket file, mysqladmin waits
until the server&rsquo;s process ID file has been removed,
to ensure that the server has stopped properly.</p>

<p>mysqladmin supports the following options, which can be
specified on the command line or in the [mysqladmin] and
[client] groups of an option file. mysqladmin also supports
the options for processing option files described at Section
4.2.3.4, Command-Line Options that Affect Option-File
Handling.</p>

<p>&middot; --help, -?</p>

<p>Display a help message and exit.</p>

<p>&middot; --bind-address=ip_address</p>

<p>On a computer having multiple network interfaces, this
option can be used to select which interface is employed
when connecting to the MySQL server.</p>

<p>This option is supported only in the version of
mysqladmin that is supplied with MySQL Cluster, beginning
with MySQL Cluster NDB 6.3.4. It is not available in
standard MySQL 5.1 releases.</p>

<p>&middot; --character-sets-dir=path</p>

<p>The directory where character sets are installed. See
Section 10.5, Character Set Configuration.</p>

<p>&middot; --compress, -C</p>

<p>Compress all information sent between the client and the
server if both support compression.</p>

<p>&middot; --count=N, -c N</p>

<p>The number of iterations to make for repeated command
execution if the --sleep option is given.</p>

<p>&middot; --debug[=debug_options], -# [debug_options]</p>

<p>Write a debugging log. A typical debug_options string is
&rsquo;d:t:o,file_name&rsquo;. The default is
&rsquo;d:t:o,/tmp/mysqladmin.trace&rsquo;.</p>

<p>&middot; --debug-check</p>

<p>Print some debugging information when the program exits.
This option was added in MySQL 5.1.21.</p>

<p>&middot; --debug-info</p>

<p>Print debugging information and memory and CPU usage
statistics when the program exits. This option was added in
MySQL 5.1.14.</p>

<p>&middot; --default-character-set=charset_name</p>

<p>Use charset_name as the default character set. See
Section 10.5, Character Set Configuration.</p>

<p>&middot; --force, -f</p>

<p>Do not ask for confirmation for the drop db_name
command. With multiple commands, continue even if an error
occurs.</p>

<p>&middot; --host=host_name, -h host_name</p>

<p>Connect to the MySQL server on the given host.</p>

<p>&middot; --no-beep, -b</p>

<p>Suppress the warning beep that is emitted by default for
errors such as a failure to connect to the server. This
option was added in MySQL 5.1.17.</p>

<p>&middot; --password[=password], -p[password]</p>

<p>The password to use when connecting to the server. If
you use the short option form (-p), you cannot have a space
between the option and the password. If you omit the
password value following the --password or -p option on the
command line, mysqladmin prompts for one.</p>

<p>Specifying a password on the command line should be
considered insecure. See Section 6.1.2.1, End-User
Guidelines for Password Security. You can use an option file
to avoid giving the password on the command line.</p>

<p>&middot; --pipe, -W</p>

<p>On Windows, connect to the server using a named pipe.
This option applies only if the server supports named-pipe
connections.</p>

<p>&middot; --port=port_num, -P port_num</p>

<p>The TCP/IP port number to use for the connection.</p>

<p>&middot; --protocol={TCP|SOCKET|PIPE|MEMORY}</p>

<p>The connection protocol to use for connecting to the
server. It is useful when the other connection parameters
normally would cause a protocol to be used other than the
one you want. For details on the permissible values, see
Section 4.2.2, Connecting to the MySQL Server.</p>

<p>&middot; --relative, -r</p>

<p>Show the difference between the current and previous
values when used with the --sleep option. This option works
only with the extended-status command.</p>

<p>&middot; --silent, -s</p>

<p>Exit silently if a connection to the server cannot be
established.</p>

<p>&middot; --sleep=delay, -i delay</p>

<p>Execute commands repeatedly, sleeping for delay seconds
in between. The --count option determines the number of
iterations. If --count is not given, mysqladmin executes
commands indefinitely until interrupted.</p>

<p>&middot; --socket=path, -S path</p>

<p>For connections to localhost, the Unix socket file to
use, or, on Windows, the name of the named pipe to use.</p>

<p>&middot; --ssl*</p>

<p>Options that begin with --ssl specify whether to connect
to the server using SSL and indicate where to find SSL keys
and certificates. See Section 6.3.6.4, SSL Command Options
.</p>

<p>&middot; --user=user_name, -u user_name</p>

<p>The MySQL user name to use when connecting to the
server.</p>

<p>&middot; --verbose, -v</p>

<p>Verbose mode. Print more information about what the
program does.</p>

<p>&middot; --version, -V</p>

<p>Display version information and exit.</p>

<p>&middot; --vertical, -E</p>

<p>Print output vertically. This is similar to --relative,
but prints output vertically.</p>

<p>&middot; --wait[=count], -w[count]</p>

<p>If the connection cannot be established, wait and retry
instead of aborting. If a count value is given, it indicates
the number of times to retry. The default is one time.</p>

<p>You can also set the following variables by using
--var_name=value The --set-variable format is deprecated and
is removed in MySQL 5.5.</p>

<p>&middot; connect_timeout</p>

<p>The maximum number of seconds before connection timeout.
The default value is 43200 (12 hours).</p>

<p>&middot; shutdown_timeout</p>

<p>The maximum number of seconds to wait for server
shutdown. The default value is 3600 (1 hour).</p>
