<p>NAME xprop - property displayer for X</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS xprop [-help] [-grammar] [-id id] [-root]
[-name name] [-frame] [-font font] [-display display] [-len
n] [-notype] [-fs file] [-remove prop- erty-name] [-set
property-name value] [-spy] [-f atom format [dfor- mat]]*
[format [dformat] atom]*</p>

<p>SUMMARY The xprop utility is for displaying window and
font properties in an X server. One window or font is
selected using the command line argu- ments or possibly in
the case of a window, by clicking on the desired window. A
list of properties is then given, possibly with formatting
information.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -help Print out a summary of command line
options.</p>

<p>-grammar Print out a detailed grammar for all command
line options.</p>

<p>-id id This argument allows the user to select window id
on the com- mand line rather than using the pointer to
select the target window. This is very useful in debugging X
applications where the target window is not mapped to the
screen or where the use of the pointer might be impossible
or interfere with the appli- cation.</p>

<p>-name name This argument allows the user to specify that
the window named name is the target window on the command
line rather than using the pointer to select the target
window.</p>

<p>-font font This argument allows the user to specify that
the properties of font font should be displayed.</p>

<p>-root This argument specifies that Xs root window is the
target win- dow. This is useful in situations where the root
window is completely obscured.</p>

<p>-display display This argument allows you to specify the
server to connect to; see X(7).</p>

<p>-len n Specifies that at most n bytes of any property
should be read or displayed.</p>

<p>-notype Specifies that the type of each property should
not be dis- played.</p>

<p>-fs file Specifies that file file should be used as a
source of more formats for properties.</p>

<p>-frame Specifies that when selecting a window by hand
(i.e. if none of -name, -root, or -id are given), look at
the window manager frame (if any) instead of looking for the
client window.</p>

<p>-remove property-name Specifies the name of a property
to be removed from the indi- cated window.</p>

<p>-set property-name value Specifies the name of a
property and a property value, to be set on the indicated
window.</p>

<p>-spy Examine window properties forever, looking for
property change events.</p>

<p>-f name format [dformat] Specifies that the format for
name should be format and that the dformat for name should
be dformat. If dformat is missing, &quot; = $0+0 is
assumed.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION For each of these properties, its value on
the selected window or font is printed using the supplied
formatting information if any. If no formatting information
is supplied, internal defaults are used. If a property is
not defined on the selected window or font, &quot;not
defined&quot; is printed as the value for that property. If
no property list is given, all the properties possessed by
the selected window or font are printed.</p>

<p>A window may be selected in one of four ways. First, if
the desired window is the root window, the -root argument
may be used. If the desired window is not the root window,
it may be selected in two ways on the command line, either
by id number such as might be obtained from xwininfo, or by
name if the window possesses a name. The -id argument
selects a window by id number in either decimal or hex (must
start with 0x) while the -name argument selects a window by
name.</p>

<p>The last way to select a window does not involve the
command line at all. If none of -font, -id, -name, and -root
are specified, a crosshairs cursor is displayed and the user
is allowed to choose any visible window by pressing any
pointer button in the desired window. If it is desired to
display properties of a font as opposed to a win- dow, the
-font argument must be used.</p>

<p>Other than the above four arguments and the -help
argument for obtain- ing help, and the -grammar argument for
listing the full grammar for the command line, all the other
command line arguments are used in specifying both the
format of the properties to be displayed and how to display
them. The -len n argument specifies that at most n bytes of
any given property will be read and displayed. This is
useful for example when displaying the cut buffer on the
root window which could run to several pages if displayed in
full.</p>

<p>Normally each property name is displayed by printing
first the property name then its type (if it has one) in
parentheses followed by its value. The -notype argument
specifies that property types should not be displayed. The
-fs argument is used to specify a file containing a list of
formats for properties while the -f argument is used to
specify the format for one property.</p>

<p>The formatting information for a property actually
consists of two parts, a format and a dformat. The format
specifies the actual formatting of the property (i.e., is it
made up of words, bytes, or longs?, etc.) while the dformat
specifies how the property should be displayed.</p>

<p>The following paragraphs describe how to construct
formats and dfor- mats. However, for the vast majority of
users and uses, this should not be necessary as the built in
defaults contain the formats and dfor- mats necessary to
display all the standard properties. It should only be
necessary to specify formats and dformats if a new property
is being dealt with or the user dislikes the standard
display format. New users especially are encouraged to skip
this part.</p>

<p>A format consists of one of 0, 8, 16, or 32 followed by
a sequence of one or more format characters. The 0, 8, 16,
or 32 specifies how many bits per field there are in the
property. Zero is a special case mean- ing use the field
size information associated with the property itself. (This
is only needed for special cases like type INTEGER which is
actu- ally three different types depending on the size of
the fields of the property.)</p>

<p>A value of 8 means that the property is a sequence of
bytes while a value of 16 would mean that the property is a
sequence of words. The difference between these two lies in
the fact that the sequence of words will be byte swapped
while the sequence of bytes will not be when read by a
machine of the opposite byte order of the machine that
origi- nally wrote the property. For more information on how
properties are formatted and stored, consult the Xlib
manual.</p>

<p>Once the size of the fields has been specified, it is
necessary to specify the type of each field (i.e., is it an
integer, a string, an atom, or what?) This is done using one
format character per field. If there are more fields in the
property than format characters supplied, the last character
will be repeated as many times as necessary for the extra
fields. The format characters and their meaning are as
follows:</p>

<p>a The field holds an atom number. A field of this type
should be of size 32.</p>

<p>b The field is an boolean. A 0 means false while
anything else means true.</p>

<p>c The field is an unsigned number, a cardinal.</p>

<p>i The field is a signed integer.</p>

<p>m The field is a set of bit flags, 1 meaning on.</p>

<p>o The field is an array of icons, packed as a sequence
of 32 bit numbers consisting of the width, height and ARGB
pixel values, as defined for the _NET_WM_ICON property in
the Extended Window Manager Hints specification. A field of
this type must be of size 32.</p>

<p>s This field and the next ones until either a 0 or the
end of the property represent a sequence of bytes. This
format character is only usable with a field size of 8 and
is most often used to represent a string.</p>

<p>t This field and the next ones until either a 0 or the
end of the property represent an internationalized text
string. This format character is only usable with a field
size of 8. The string is assumed to be in an ICCCM compliant
encoding and is converted to the current locale encoding
before being output.</p>

<p>u This field and the next ones until either a 0 or the
end of the property represent an UTF-8 encoded unicode
string. This format character is only usable with a field
size of 8. If the string is found to be an invalid
character, the type of encoding violation is printed
instead, followed by the string formatted using s. When in
an environment not capable of displaying UTF-8 encoded
string, behaviour is identical to s .</p>

<p>x The field is a hex number (like c but displayed in hex
- most useful for displaying window ids and the like)</p>

<p>An example format is 32ica which is the format for a
property of three fields of 32 bits each, the first holding
a signed integer, the second an unsigned integer, and the
third an atom.</p>

<p>The format of a dformat unlike that of a format is not
so rigid. The only limitations on a dformat is that one may
not start with a letter or a dash. This is so that it can be
distinguished from a property name or an argument. A dformat
is a text string containing special characters instructing
that various fields be printed at various points in a manner
similar to the formatting string used by printf. For exam-
ple, the dformat &quot; is ( $0, $1 0 would render the POINT
3, -4 which has a format of 32ii as &quot; is ( 3, -4
)0.</p>

<p>Any character other than a $, ?, or a ( in a dformat
prints as itself. To print out one of $, ?, or ( precede it
by a . For example, to print out a $, use Several special
backslash sequences are provided as shortcuts. will cause a
newline to be displayed while will cause a tab to be
displayed. o where o is an octal num- ber will display
character number o.</p>

<p>A $ followed by a number n causes field number n to be
displayed. The format of the displayed field depends on the
formatting character used to describe it in the
corresponding format. I.e., if a cardinal is described by c
it will print in decimal while if it is described by a x it
is displayed in hex.</p>

<p>If the field is not present in the property (this is
possible with some properties), &lt;field not available&gt;
is displayed instead. $n+ will dis- play field number n then
a comma then field number n+1 then another comma then ...
until the last field defined. If field n is not defined,
nothing is displayed. This is useful for a property that is
a list of values.</p>

<p>A ? is used to start a conditional expression, a kind of
if-then state- ment. ?exp(text) will display text if and
only if exp evaluates to non-zero. This is useful for two
things. First, it allows fields to be displayed if and only
if a flag is set. And second, it allows a value such as a
state number to be displayed as a name rather than as just a
number. The syntax of exp is as follows:</p>

<p>exp ::= term | term=exp | !exp</p>

<p>term ::= n | $n | mn</p>

<p>The ! operator is a logical not, changing 0 to 1 and any
non-zero value to 0. = is an equality operator. Note that
internally all expressions are evaluated as 32 bit numbers
so -1 is not equal to 65535. = returns 1 if the two values
are equal and 0 if not. n repre- sents the constant value n
while $n represents the value of field num- ber n. mn is 1
if flag number n in the first field having format char-
acter m in the corresponding format is 1, 0 otherwise.</p>

<p>Examples: ?m3(count: $30 displays field 3 with a label
of count if and only if flag number 3 (count starts at 0!)
is on. ?$2=0(True)?!$2=0(False) displays the inverted value
of field 2 as a boolean.</p>

<p>In order to display a property, xprop needs both a
format and a dfor- mat. Before xprop uses its default values
of a format of 32x and a dformat of &quot; = { $0+ }0, it
searches several places in an attempt to find more specific
formats. First, a search is made using the name of the
property. If this fails, a search is made using the type of
the property. This allows type STRING to be defined with one
set of for- mats while allowing property WM_NAME which is of
type STRING to be defined with a different format. In this
way, the display formats for a given type can be overridden
for specific properties.</p>

<p>The locations searched are in order: the format if any
specified with the property name (as in 8x WM_NAME), the
formats defined by -f options in last to first order, the
contents of the file specified by the -fs option if any, the
contents of the file specified by the environmental variable
XPROPFORMATS if any, and finally xprops built in file of
for- mats.</p>

<p>The format of the files referred to by the -fs argument
and the XPROP- FORMATS variable is one or more lines of the
following form:</p>

<p>name format [dformat]</p>

<p>Where name is either the name of a property or the name
of a type, for- mat is the format to be used with name and
dformat is the dformat to be used with name. If dformat is
not present, &quot; = $0+0 is assumed.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES To display the name of the root window: xprop
-root WM_NAME</p>

<p>To display the window manager hints for the clock: xprop
-name xclock WM_HINTS</p>

<p>To display the start of the cut buffer: xprop -root -len
100 CUT_BUFFER0</p>

<p>To display the point size of the fixed font: xprop -font
fixed POINT_SIZE</p>

<p>To display all the properties of window # 0x200007:
xprop -id 0x200007</p>

<p>To set a simple string property: xprop -root -format
MY_ATOM_NAME 8s -set MY_ATOM_NAME &quot;my_value&quot;</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT DISPLAY To get default display.</p>

<p>XPROPFORMATS Specifies the name of a file from which
additional formats are to be obtained.</p>
