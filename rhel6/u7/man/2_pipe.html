<p>PIPE(2) Linux Programmer s Manual PIPE(2)</p>

<p>NAME pipe, pipe2 - create pipe</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>int pipe(int pipefd[2]);</p>

<p>#define _GNU_SOURCE #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>int pipe2(int pipefd[2], int flags);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pipe() creates a pipe, a unidirectional data
channel that can be used for interprocess communication. The
array pipefd is used to return two file descriptors
referring to the ends of the pipe. pipefd[0] refers to the
read end of the pipe. pipefd[1] refers to the write end of
the pipe. Data written to the write end of the pipe is
buffered by the kernel until it is read from the read end of
the pipe. For further details, see pipe(7).</p>

<p>If flags is 0, then pipe2() is the same as pipe(). The
following val- ues can be bitwise ORed in flags to obtain
different behavior:</p>

<p>O_NONBLOCK Set the O_NONBLOCK file status flag on the
two new open file descriptions. Using this flag saves extra
calls to fcntl(2) to achieve the same result.</p>

<p>O_CLOEXEC Set the close-on-exec (FD_CLOEXEC) flag on the
two new file descriptors. See the description of the same
flag in open(2) for reasons why this may be useful.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, zero is returned. On error, -1
is returned, and errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS EFAULT pipefd is not valid.</p>

<p>EINVAL (pipe2()) Invalid value in flags.</p>

<p>EMFILE Too many file descriptors are in use by the
process.</p>

<p>ENFILE The system limit on the total number of open
files has been reached.</p>

<p>VERSIONS pipe2() was added to Linux in version 2.6.27;
glibc support is avail- able starting with version 2.9.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO pipe(): POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>pipe2() is Linux-specific.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE The following program creates a pipe, and then
fork(2)s to create a child process; the child inherits a
duplicate set of file descriptors that refer to the same
pipe. After the fork(2), each process closes the descriptors
that it doesn t need for the pipe (see pipe(7)). The parent
then writes the string contained in the program s
command-line argument to the pipe, and the child reads this
string a byte at a time from the pipe and echoes it on
standard output.</p>

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt; #include
&lt;unistd.h&gt; #include &lt;string.h&gt;</p>

<p>int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { int pipefd[2]; pid_t
cpid; char buf;</p>

<p>assert(argc == 2);</p>

<p>if (pipe(pipefd) == -1) { perror(&quot;pipe&quot;);
exit(EXIT_FAILURE); }</p>

<p>cpid = fork(); if (cpid == -1) {
perror(&quot;fork&quot;); exit(EXIT_FAILURE); }</p>

<p>if (cpid == 0) { /* Child reads from pipe */
close(pipefd[1]); /* Close unused write end */</p>

<p>while (read(pipefd[0], &amp;buf, 1) &gt; 0)
write(STDOUT_FILENO, &amp;buf, 1);</p>

<p>write(STDOUT_FILENO, &quot;0, 1); close(pipefd[0]);
_exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);</p>

<p>} else { /* Parent writes argv[1] to pipe */
close(pipefd[0]); /* Close unused read end */
write(pipefd[1], argv[1], strlen(argv[1]));
close(pipefd[1]); /* Reader will see EOF */ wait(NULL); /*
Wait for child */ exit(EXIT_SUCCESS); } }</p>
