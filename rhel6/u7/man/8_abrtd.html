<p>ABRTD(8) ABRT Manual ABRTD(8)</p>

<p>NAME abrtd - automated bug reporting tool&acute;s
daemon.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS abrtd [-dsv[v]...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION abrtd is a daemon that watches for
application crashes. When a crash occurs, it collects the
problem data (core file, applications command line etc.) and
takes action according to the type of application that
crashed and according to the configuration in the abrt.conf
config file. There are plugins for various actions: for
example to report the crash to Bugzilla, to mail the report,
or to transfer the report via FTP or SCP. See the manual
pages for the respective plugins.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -d Stay in the foreground and log to standard
error.</p>

<p>-s Log to system log even with option -d.</p>

<p>-v Log more detailed debugging information.</p>

<p>CAVEATS When you use some other crash-catching tool
specific for an application or an application type (for
example BugBuddy for GNOME applications), crashes of this
type will be handled by that tool and not by abrtd. If you
want abrtd to handle these crashes, turn off the
higher-level crash-catching tool.</p>
