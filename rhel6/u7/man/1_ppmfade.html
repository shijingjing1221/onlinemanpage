<p>NAME ppmfade - generate a transition between two image
files using special effects</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ppmfade [-f first.ppm] [-l last.ppm]
[-mix|-spread|-shift| -relief|-oil|-edge|-bentley|-block]
[-base name]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>ppmfadegenerates a transition between either two input
images or between one input image and black. You can use the
30 intermediate images generated to show a smooth transition
between segments of a movie. The input and output images are
in the PPM format. If you specify both input images, they
should both be the same size. If you want to fade from black
to an image, specify only the last image. If you want to
fade from an image to black, specify only the first image.
ppmfade names the resulting image files base.nnnn.ppm, where
nnnn is a number varying between 0001 and 0030 and base is
what you specify with via the -base option (default
fade).</p>

<p>Another way to convert by steps from one image to
another is morphing. You can use xmorph to do that.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -f first.ppm This is the image file (PPM format)
to be used at the beginning of the transition. If you dont
specify this, the fade will start from black.</p>

<p>-l last.ppm This is the image file (PPM format) to be
used at the ending of the transition. If you don t specify
this, the fade will end with black.</p>

<p>-mix The two images are superimposed with the brightness
of the first image decreasing from full to none and the
brightness of the final image increasing from none to full.
The transition is quadratic in brightness with faster
transition in the beginning and slower at the end.</p>

<p>-spread The pixels in the first image will be moved
(spread) further and further from their original location
and then moved into the proper location in the final image.
This is the default transi- tion.</p>

<p>-shift The pixels in the first image will be shifted
further and fur- ther horizontally from their original
location and then moved into the proper location in the
final image.</p>

<p>-relief The first image is faded to a Laplacian relief
filtered version of the first image. This is then faded to a
Laplacian relief filtered version of the second image and
finally faded to the final image.</p>

<p>-oil The first image is faded to an oil transfer version
of the first image. This is then faded to an oil transfer
version of the second image and finally faded to the final
image.</p>

<p>-edge The first image is faded to an edge detected
version of the first image. This is then faded to an edge
detected version of the second image and finally faded to
the final image.</p>

<p>-bentley The first image is faded to a Bentley Effect
version of the first image. This is then faded to a Bentley
Effect version of the second image and finally faded to the
final image.</p>

<p>-block The first image is defocused to small blocks. The
small blocks are converted to match a defocused version of
the last image. The block version of the last image is then
focused to the final image.</p>

<p>-base name This forms part of the output filenames, as
described above.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES ppmfade -f teapot.ppm -l pyr.ppm</p>

<p>Fade from teapot.ppm to pyr.ppm generating fade.0001.ppm
to fade.0030.ppm using the spread transition.</p>

<p>ppmfade -l teapot.ppm</p>

<p>Fade from black to teapot.ppm generating fade.0001.ppm
to fade.0030.ppm.</p>

<p>ppmfade -f teapot.ppm -base end</p>

<p>Fade from teapot.ppm to black generating end.0001.ppm to
end.0030.ppm.</p>
