<p>UNLINKAT(2) Linux Programmer s Manual UNLINKAT(2)</p>

<p>NAME unlinkat - remove a directory entry relative to a
directory file descriptor</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #define _ATFILE_SOURCE #include
&lt;fcntl.h&gt;</p>

<p>int unlinkat(int dirfd, const char *pathname, int
flags);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The unlinkat() system call operates in
exactly the same way as either unlink(2) or rmdir(2)
(depending on whether or not flags includes the AT_REMOVEDIR
flag) except for the differences described in this manual
page.</p>

<p>If the pathname given in pathname is relative, then it
is interpreted relative to the directory referred to by the
file descriptor dirfd (rather than relative to the current
working directory of the calling process, as is done by
unlink(2) and rmdir(2) for a relative pathname).</p>

<p>If the pathname given in pathname is relative and dirfd
is the special value AT_FDCWD, then pathname is interpreted
relative to the current working directory of the calling
process (like unlink(2) and rmdir(2)).</p>

<p>If the pathname given in pathname is absolute, then
dirfd is ignored.</p>

<p>flags is a bit mask that can either be specified as 0,
or by ORing together flag values that control the operation
of unlinkat(). Cur- rently only one such flags is
defined:</p>

<p>AT_REMOVEDIR By default, unlinkat() performs the
equivalent of unlink(2) on pathname. If the AT_REMOVEDIR
flag is specified, then performs the equivalent of rmdir(2)
on pathname.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, unlinkat() returns 0. On error,
-1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The same errors that occur for unlink(2) and
rmdir(2) can also occur for unlinkat(). The following
additional errors can occur for unlinkat():</p>

<p>EBADF dirfd is not a valid file descriptor.</p>

<p>EINVAL An invalid flag value was specified in flags.</p>

<p>ENOTDIR pathname is relative and dirfd is a file
descriptor referring to a file other than a directory.</p>

<p>VERSIONS unlinkat() was added to Linux in kernel
2.6.16.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO POSIX.1-2008. A similar system call exists
on Solaris.</p>

<p>NOTES See openat(2) for an explanation of the need for
unlinkat().</p>
