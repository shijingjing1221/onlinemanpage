<p>NAME auvirt - a program that shows data related to
virtual machines</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS auvirt [ OPTIONS ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION auvirt shows a list of guest sessions found
in the audit logs. If a guest is specified, only the events
related to that guest is consid- ered. To specify a guest,
both UUID or VM name can be given.</p>

<p>For each guest session the tool prints a record with the
domain name, the user that started the guest, the time when
the guest was started and the time when the guest was
stoped.</p>

<p>If the option &quot;--all-events&quot; is given a more
detailed output is shown. In this mode other records are
shown for guests stops, resource assignments, host shutdowns
and AVC and anomaly events. The first field indicates the
event type and can have the following values: start, stop,
res, avc, anom and down (for host shutdowns).</p>

<p>Resource assignments have the additional fields:
resource type, reason and resource. And AVC records have the
following additional fields: operation, result, command and
target.</p>

<p>By default, auvirt reads records from the system audit
log file. But --stdin and --file options can be specified to
change this behavior.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --all-events Show records for all virtualization
related events.</p>

<p>--debug Print debug messages to standard output.</p>

<p>-f, --file file Read records from the given file instead
from the system audit log file.</p>

<p>-h, --help Print help message and exit.</p>

<p>--proof Add after each event a line containing all the
identifiers of the audit records used to calculate the
event. Each identifier consists of unix time, milliseconds
and serial number.</p>

<p>--show-uuid Add the guests UUID to each record.</p>

<p>--stdin Read records from the standard input instead
from the system audit log file. This option cannot be
specified with --file.</p>

<p>--summary Print a summary with information about the
events found. The summary contains the considered range of
time, the number of guest starts and stops, the number of
resource assignments, the number of AVC and anomaly events,
the number of host shutdowns and the number of failed
operations.</p>

<p>-te, --end [end-date] [end-time] Search for events with
time stamps equal to or before the given end time. The
format of end time depends on your locale. If the date is
omitted, today is assumed. If the time is omitted, now is
assumed. Use 24 hour clock time rather than AM or PM to
spec- ify time. An example date using the en_US.utf8 locale
is 09/03/2009. An example of time is 18:00:00. The date
format accepted is influenced by the LC_TIME environmental
variable.</p>

<p>You may also use the word: now, recent, today,
yesterday, this-week, week-ago, this-month, this-year. Today
means starting now. Recent is 10 minutes ago. Yesterday is 1
second after mid- night the previous day. This-week means
starting 1 second after midnight on day 0 of the week
determined by your locale (see localtime). This-month means
1 second after midnight on day 1 of the month. This-year
means the 1 second after midnight on the first day of the
first month.</p>

<p>-ts, --start [start-date] [start-time] Search for events
with time stamps equal to or after the given end time. The
format of end time depends on your locale. If the date is
omitted, today is assumed. If the time is omitted, mid-
night is assumed. Use 24 hour clock time rather than AM or
PM to specify time. An example date using the en_US.utf8
locale is 09/03/2009. An example of time is 18:00:00. The
date format accepted is influenced by the LC_TIME
environmental variable.</p>

<p>You may also use the word: now, recent, today,
yesterday, this-week, this-month, this-year. Today means
starting at 1 second after midnight. Recent is 10 minutes
ago. Yesterday is 1 second after midnight the previous day.
This-week means start- ing 1 second after midnight on day 0
of the week determined by your locale (see localtime).
This-month means 1 second after midnight on day 1 of the
month. This-year means the 1 second after midnight on the
first day of the first month.</p>

<p>-u, --uuid UUID Only show events related to the guest
with the given UUID.</p>

<p>-v, --vm name Only show events related to the guest with
the given name.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES To see all the records in this month for a
guest</p>

<p>auvirt --start this-month --vm GuestVmName
--all-events</p>
