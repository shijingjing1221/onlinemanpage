<p>DESCRIPTION This set of functions is for tranferring
bytes in the relevant transfer mode. For ECP and EPP modes
two types of transfer are possible: data and address
(usually referred to as channel in ECP).</p>

<p>The supplied port must be a claimed port.</p>

<p>The supplied buffer must be at least len bytes long.
When reading, the transferred data is stored in the buffer;
when writing the data to be transferred is taken from the
buffer.</p>

<p>For reads (peripheral to host): if no data is available
and F1284_NONBLOCK is not in effect, the inactivity timer is
started. If data becomes available before the inactivity
time-out elapses it is read; otherwise the return value will
be E1284_TIMEDOUT.</p>

<p>For writes (host to peripheral): if the peripheral is
not willing to accept data and F1284_NONBLOCK is not in
effect, the inactivity timer is started. If the peripheral
indicates that it is willing to accept data before the
inactivity time-out elapses it is sent; otherwise the return
value will be E1284_TIMEDOUT</p>

<p>The flags may alter the behaviour slightly:</p>

<p>F1284_NONBLOCK For reads (peripheral to host): if no
data is available, return immediately (with
E1284_TIMEDOUT).</p>

<p>For writes (host to peripheral): if the peripheral is
not willing to accept data, return immediately (with
E1284_TIMEDOUT).</p>

<p>F1284_SWE Don&acute;t use hardware assistance for the
transfer, but instead set the parallel port pins according
to the wire protocol.</p>

<p>F1284_RLE (for ECP only) Use run length encoding. If the
peripheral is in ECP mode with RLE, calls to
ieee1284_ecp_read_data must set this flag in order for the
RLE from the peripheral to be interpreted correctly, and
calls to ieee1284_ecp_write_data may set this flag in order
to take advantage of RLE.</p>

<p>F1284_FASTEPP (for EPP only) Use multi-byte transfers.
Several bytes at a time are transferred using hardware
assistance, if supporting hardware is present. The price of
this increased speed is that the return value will be less
reliable when this flag is used.</p>

<p>For ECP mode, a given direction is in force at any
particular time, and it is up to the application to ensure
that it is only writing when in forward mode, and reading
when in reverse mode.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The return value is the number of bytes
successfully transferred or, if negative, one of:</p>

<p>E1284_NOTIMPL This transfer mode and flags combination
is not yet implemented in libieee1284.</p>

<p>E1284_TIMEDOUT Timed out waiting for peripheral to
handshake.</p>

<p>E1284_NOMEM Not enough memory is available.</p>

<p>E1284_SYS There was a problem at the operating system
level. The global variable errno has been set
appropriately.</p>

<p>E1284_INVALIDPORT The port parameter is invalid (for
instance, perhaps the port is not claimed).</p>

<p>If any bytes are successfully transferred, that number
is returned. An error is returned only if no bytes are
transferred.</p>

<p>For host-to-peripheral transfers, all data is at the
peripheral by the time the call returns.</p>
