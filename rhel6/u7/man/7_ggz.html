<p>ggz(7) GGZ Gaming Zone ggz(7)</p>

<p>NAME ggz - The GGZ Gaming Zone</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The GGZ Gaming Zone is a
standards-conforming free online gaming infrastructure which
provides many applications and games to people who like to
play on the internet or in local networks. GGZ, how the
(recursive) acronym is called, is available for many
computer systems. This document focuses on the installations
on Linux, BSD and Unix. On such systems, GGZ-powered games
often ship with the KDE and GNOME games packages, and most
distributors also include all components as released by the
GGZ project.</p>

<p>APPLICATIONS GGZ is available on several platforms. A
multitude of programs is available to the user, and even
more which operate on the system level or are used by
developers and administrators. Users will most likely want
to connect to a GGZ server on the internet, such as
ggz://live.ggzgamingzone.org, to play games against other
people. Core clients are used to perform this task.
Functional clients exist in the form of kggz for the K
Desktop Environment (KDE), ggz-gtk for GNOME or XFCE users,
and ggz-txt for people who prefer command-line applica-
tions. Of course, the clients are not bound to a specific
desktop, but the choices above will likely be influenced by
the level of integra- tion. In particular, the GNOME client
is often found embedded in GGZ- enabled games of the GNOME
project. A client under development is the SDL-based
v&iacute;bora. Furthermore, a Java-based client and applet
exists as well. Running ggz will automatically select a
suitable core client depending on the desktop
environment.</p>

<p>Special clients exist in the form of ggzap, a
quick-launcher for the KDE panel, and ggz-wrapper which is
used for launching GGZ games from the command line and
instant messenger applications.</p>

<p>GAMES Games are usually launched by the GGZ server, with
corresponding game clients running on the users desktop.
Plenty of games are available for GGZ, most of them coming
from the GGZ project itself but several independent game
projects do now provide GGZ support. Game clients are
implemented using multiple toolkits, some of which stem from
certain desktop environments. However, all games work
equally well under all desktops, it s just a matter of
personal choice which of them are to be installed - having
all of them is just fine.</p>

<p>While some GGZ game clients are suited for online gaming
only, others also run locally like normal games happen to
do. Those will be found in the desktops application
menu.</p>

<p>FILES The following layout can vary from site to site,
depending on the com- pleteness of a GGZ installation and
the operating system distribution in use. It adheres to the
File Hierarchy Standard (FHS) as much as possible.</p>

<p>/usr/bin GGZ applications, tools, and the games which
provide single player mode.</p>

<p>/usr/lib/ggz(d) GGZ game clients and servers.</p>

<p>/usr/share/ggz(d) Data files for game clients and
servers.</p>

<p>/etc/ggz.modules Game module registry for game
clients.</p>

<p>/etc/ggzd Configuration for the GGZ server, including
rooms and game types.</p>
