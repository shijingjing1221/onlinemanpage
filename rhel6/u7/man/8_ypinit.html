<p>NAME ypinit - NIS database install and build program</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS /usr/lib64/yp/ypinit [ -m ] [ -s master_name
]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION ypinit builds the domain subdirectory of
/var/yp for the current default domain. After building the
domain subdirectory, ypinit builds a complete set of
administrative maps for your system and places them in this
directory. The first map created by ypinit -m is the
ypservers map. You should run it as root on the hosts, which
should be the master ypserver. You should have only one
master server per NIS domain.</p>

<p>All databases are built from scratch, either from
information available to the program at runtime, or from the
ASCII data base files in /etc. These files are listed below
under FILES.</p>

<p>An NIS database on a slave server is set up by copying
an existing database from a running server. The master_name
argument should be the hostname of an NIS server (either the
master server for all the maps, or a server on which the
data base is up-to-date and stable).</p>

<p>OPTIONS -m If the local host is the NIS master.</p>

<p>-s Set up a slave server with the database from
master_name</p>

<p>FILES /etc/passwd /etc/group /etc/hosts /etc/networks
/etc/services /etc/protocols /etc/netgroup /etc/rpc</p>

ypserv(8), ypxfr(8)</p>

<p>BUGS There isnt a good error handling at the moment.</p>
