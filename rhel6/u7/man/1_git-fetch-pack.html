<p>GIT-FETCH-PACK(1) Git Manual GIT-FETCH-PACK(1)</p>

<p>NAME git-fetch-pack - Receive missing objects from
another repository</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS git fetch-pack [--all] [--quiet|-q] [--keep|-k]
[--thin] [--include-tag]
[--upload-pack=&lt;git-upload-pack&gt;] [--depth=&lt;n&gt;]
[--no-progress] [-v] [&lt;host&gt;:]&lt;directory&gt;
[&lt;refs&gt;...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Usually you would want to use git fetch,
which is a higher level wrapper of this command,
instead.</p>

<p>Invokes git-upload-pack on a possibly remote repository
and asks it to send objects missing from this repository, to
update the named heads. The list of commits available
locally is found out by scanning the local refs/ hierarchy
and sent to git-upload-pack running on the other end.</p>

<p>This command degenerates to download everything to
complete the asked refs from the remote side when the local
side does not have a common ancestor commit.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --all Fetch all remote refs.</p>

<p>-q, --quiet Pass -q flag to git unpack-objects; this
makes the cloning process less verbose.</p>

<p>-k, --keep Do not invoke git unpack-objects on received
data, but create a single packfile out of it instead, and
store it in the object database. If provided twice then the
pack is locked against repacking.</p>

<p>--thin Fetch a &quot;thin&quot; pack, which records
objects in deltified form based on objects not included in
the pack to reduce network traffic.</p>

<p>--include-tag If the remote side supports it, annotated
tags objects will be downloaded on the same connection as
the other objects if the object the tag references is
downloaded. The caller must otherwise determine the tags
this option made available.</p>

<p>--upload-pack=&lt;git-upload-pack&gt; Use this to
specify the path to git-upload-pack on the remote side, if
is not found on your $PATH. Installations of sshd ignores
the users environment setup scripts for login shells (e.g.
.bash_profile) and your privately installed git may not be
found on the system default $PATH. Another workaround
suggested is to set up your $PATH in &quot;.bashrc&quot;,
but this flag is for people who do not want to pay the
overhead for non-interactive shells by having a lean .bashrc
file (they set most of the things up in .bash_profile).</p>

<p>--exec=&lt;git-upload-pack&gt; Same as
--upload-pack=&lt;git-upload-pack&gt;.</p>

<p>--depth=&lt;n&gt; Limit fetching to ancestor-chains not
longer than n.</p>

<p>--no-progress Do not show the progress.</p>

<p>-v Run verbosely.</p>

<p>&lt;host&gt; A remote host that houses the repository.
When this part is specified, git-upload-pack is invoked via
ssh.</p>

<p>&lt;directory&gt; The repository to sync from.</p>

<p>&lt;refs&gt;... The remote heads to update from. This is
relative to $GIT_DIR (e.g. &quot;HEAD&quot;,
&quot;refs/heads/master&quot;). When unspecified, update
from all heads the remote side has.</p>
