<p>STDIN(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual STDIN(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME stderr, stdin, stdout - standard I/O streams</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</p>

<p>extern FILE *stderr, *stdin, *stdout;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION A file with associated buffering is called a
stream and is declared to be a pointer to a defined type
FILE. The fopen() function shall create certain descriptive
data for a stream and return a pointer to designate the
stream in all further transactions. Normally, there are
three open streams with constant pointers declared in the
&lt;stdio.h&gt; header and associated with the standard open
files.</p>

<p>At program start-up, three streams shall be predefined
and need not be opened explicitly: standard input (for
reading conventional input), standard output (for writing
conventional output), and standard error (for writing
diagnostic output). When opened, the standard error stream
is not fully buffered; the standard input and standard
output streams are fully buffered if and only if the stream
can be determined not to refer to an interactive device.</p>

<p>The following symbolic values in &lt;unistd.h&gt; define
the file descriptors that shall be associated with the
C-language stdin, stdout, and stderr when the application is
started:</p>

<p>STDIN_FILENO Standard input value, stdin. Its value is
0.</p>

<p>STDOUT_FILENO Standard output value, stdout. Its value
is 1.</p>

<p>STDERR_FILENO Standard error value, stderr. Its value is
2.</p>

<p>The stderr stream is expected to be open for reading and
writing.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE None.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
