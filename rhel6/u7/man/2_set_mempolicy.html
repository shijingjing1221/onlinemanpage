<p>SET_MEMPOLICY(2) Linux Programmer s Manual
SET_MEMPOLICY(2)</p>

<p>NAME set_mempolicy - set default NUMA memory policy for
a process and its children</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;numaif.h&gt;</p>

<p>int set_mempolicy(int mode, unsigned long *nodemask,
unsigned long maxnode);</p>

<p>Link with -lnuma.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION set_mempolicy() sets the NUMA memory policy
of the calling process, which consists of a policy mode and
zero or more nodes, to the values specified by the mode,
nodemask and maxnode arguments.</p>

<p>A NUMA machine has different memory controllers with
different dis- tances to specific CPUs. The memory policy
defines from which node memory is allocated for the
process.</p>

<p>This system call defines the default policy for the
process. The pro- cess policy governs allocation of pages in
the process s address space outside of memory ranges
controlled by a more specific policy set by mbind(2). The
process default policy also controls allocation of any pages
for memory mapped files mapped using the mmap(2) call with
the MAP_PRIVATE flag and that are only read [loaded] from by
the process and of memory mapped files mapped using the
mmap(2) call with the MAP_SHARED flag, regardless of the
access type. The policy is only applied when a new page is
allocated for the process. For anonymous memory this is when
the page is first touched by the application.</p>

<p>The mode argument must specify one of MPOL_DEFAULT,
MPOL_BIND, MPOL_INTERLEAVE or MPOL_PREFERRED. All modes
except MPOL_DEFAULT require the caller to specify via the
nodemask argument one or more nodes.</p>

<p>The mode argument may also include an optional mode
flag. The sup- ported mode flags are:</p>

<p>MPOL_F_STATIC_NODES (since Linux 2.6.26) A non-empty
nodemask specifies physical node ids. Linux does will not
remap the nodemask when the process moves to a differ- ent
cpuset context, nor when the set of nodes allowed by the
processs current cpuset context changes.</p>

<p>MPOL_F_RELATIVE_NODES (since Linux 2.6.26) A non-empty
nodemask specifies node ids that are relative to the set of
node ids allowed by the processs current cpuset.</p>

<p>nodemask points to a bit mask of node IDs that contains
up to maxnode bits. The bit mask size is rounded to the next
multiple of sizeof(unsigned long), but the kernel will only
use bits up to maxnode. A NULL value of nodemask or a
maxnode value of zero specifies the empty set of nodes. If
the value of maxnode is zero, the nodemask argument is
ignored.</p>

<p>Where a nodemask is required, it must contain at least
one node that is on-line, allowed by the processs current
cpuset context, [unless the MPOL_F_STATIC_NODES mode flag is
specified], and contains memory. If the MPOL_F_STATIC_NODES
is set in mode and a required nodemask contains no nodes
that are allowed by the processs current cpuset context, the
memory policy reverts to local allocation. This effectively
overrides the specified policy until the processs cpuset
context includes one or more of the nodes specified by
nodemask.</p>

<p>The MPOL_DEFAULT mode specifies that any non-default
process memory policy be removed, so that the memory policy
&quot;falls back&quot; to the system default policy. The
system default policy is &quot;local allocation&quot;--
i.e., allocate memory on the node of the CPU that triggered
the alloca- tion. nodemask must be specified as NULL. If the
&quot;local node&quot; con- tains no free memory, the system
will attempt to allocate memory from a &quot;near by&quot;
node.</p>

<p>The MPOL_BIND mode defines a strict policy that
restricts memory allo- cation to the nodes specified in
nodemask. If nodemask specifies more than one node, page
allocations will come from the node with the lowest numeric
node ID first, until that node contains no free memory.
Allo- cations will then come from the node with the next
highest node ID specified in nodemask and so forth, until
none of the specified nodes contain free memory. Pages will
not be allocated from any node not specified in the
nodemask.</p>

<p>MPOL_INTERLEAVE interleaves page allocations across the
nodes specified in nodemask in numeric node ID order. This
optimizes for bandwidth instead of latency by spreading out
pages and memory accesses to those pages across multiple
nodes. However, accesses to a single page will still be
limited to the memory bandwidth of a single node.</p>

<p>MPOL_PREFERRED sets the preferred node for allocation.
The kernel will try to allocate pages from this node first
and fall back to &quot;near by&quot; nodes if the preferred
node is low on free memory. If nodemask speci- fies more
than one node ID, the first node in the mask will be
selected as the preferred node. If the nodemask and maxnode
arguments specify the empty set, then the policy specifies
&quot;local allocation&quot; (like the system default policy
discussed above).</p>

<p>The process memory policy is preserved across an
execve(2), and is inherited by child processes created using
fork(2) or clone(2).</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, set_mempolicy() returns 0; on
error, -1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the
error.</p>

<p>ERRORS EFAULT Part of all of the memory range specified
by nodemask and maxn- ode points outside your accessible
address space.</p>

<p>EINVAL mode is invalid. Or, mode is MPOL_DEFAULT and
nodemask is non- empty, or mode is MPOL_BIND or
MPOL_INTERLEAVE and nodemask is empty. Or, maxnode specifies
more than a page worth of bits. Or, nodemask specifies one
or more node IDs that are greater than the maximum supported
node ID. Or, none of the node IDs specified by nodemask are
on-line and allowed by the processs current cpuset context,
or none of the specified nodes contain memory. Or, the mode
argument specified both MPOL_F_STATIC_NODES and
MPOL_F_RELATIVE_NODES.</p>

<p>ENOMEM Insufficient kernel memory was available.</p>

<p>VERSIONS The set_mempolicy(), system call was added to
the Linux kernel in ver- sion 2.6.7.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO This system call is Linux-specific.</p>

<p>NOTES Process policy is not remembered if the page is
swapped out. When such a page is paged back in, it will use
the policy of the process or memory range that is in effect
at the time the page is allocated.</p>
