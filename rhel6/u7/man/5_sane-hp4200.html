<p>sane-hp4200(5) SANE Scanner Access Now Easy
sane-hp4200(5)</p>

<p>NAME sane-hp4200 - SANE backend for Hewlett-Packard 4200
scanners</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sane-hp4200 library implements a SANE
(Scanner Access Now Easy) backend that provides access to
the following Hewlett-Packard USB flatbed scanners:</p>

<p>ScanJet 4200 C ScanJet 4200 Cxi ScanJet 4200 Cse</p>

<p>More details can be found on the hp4200 backend homepage
http://hp4200-backend.sourceforge.net/.</p>

<p>This is BETA software. Keep your hand at the scanners
plug and unplug it, if the head bumps at the end of the scan
area.</p>

<p>If you own a scanner other than the ones listed above
that works with this backend, please let us know this by
sending the scanners exact model name and the USB vendor and
device ids (e.g. from /proc/bus/usb/devices,
sane-find-scanner or syslog) to us. Even if the scanner s
name is only slightly different from the models mentioned
above, please let us know.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION The contents of the hp4200.conf file is a
list of usb lines containing vendor and product ids that
correspond to USB scanners. The file can also contain the
names of device files that correspond to an HP 4200 scanner.
Empty lines and lines starting with a hash mark (#) are
ignored. The scanners are autodetected by usb vendor_id
product_id statements which are already included into
hp4200.conf. &quot;vendor_id&quot; and
&quot;product_id&quot; are hexadecimal numbers that identify
the scanner. If autodetection does not work, add the device
name of your scanner to the configuration file, e.g.
/dev/usb/scanner0.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/sane.d/hp4200.conf The backend configuration
file (see also description of SANE_CONFIG_DIR below).</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-hp4200.a The static library
implementing this backend.</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-hp4200.so The shared library
implementing this backend (present on systems that support
dynamic loading).</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT SANE_CONFIG_DIR This environment variable
specifies the list of directories that may contain the
configuration file. Under UNIX, the directories are
separated by a colon (:), under OS/2, they are separated by
a semi-colon (;). If this variable is not set, the config-
uration file is searched in two default directories: first,
the current working directory (&quot;.&quot;) and then in
/etc/sane.d. If the value of the environment variable ends
with the directory sepa- rator character, then the default
directories are searched after the explicitly specified
directories. For example, setting SANE_CONFIG_DIR to
&quot;/tmp/config:&quot; would result in directories
&quot;tmp/config&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and
&quot;/etc/sane.d&quot; being searched (in this order).</p>

<p>SANE_DEBUG_HP4200 If the library was compiled with debug
support enabled, this environment variable controls the
debug level for this backend. Higher debug levels increase
the verbosity of the output.</p>

<p>Example: export SANE_DEBUG_HP4200=4</p>

<p>BUGS Tested only with Linux.</p>

<p>Only 8 bit color mode works.</p>

<p>Scanning is slow due to backtracking.</p>
