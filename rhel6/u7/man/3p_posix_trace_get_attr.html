<p>POSIX_TRACE_GET_ATTR(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
POSIX_TRACE_GET_ATTR(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME posix_trace_get_attr, posix_trace_get_status -
retrieve the trace attributes or trace status (TRACING)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;trace.h&gt;</p>

<p>int posix_trace_get_attr(trace_id_t trid, trace_attr_t
*attr); int posix_trace_get_status(trace_id_t trid, struct
posix_trace_status_info *statusinfo);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The posix_trace_get_attr() function shall
copy the attributes of the active trace stream identified by
trid into the object pointed to by the attr argument. If the
Trace Log option is supported, trid may represent a
pre-recorded trace log.</p>

<p>The posix_trace_get_status() function shall return, in
the structure pointed to by the statusinfo argument, the
current trace status for the trace stream identified by the
trid argument. These status values returned in the structure
pointed to by statusinfo shall have been appropriately read
to ensure that the returned values are consistent. If the
Trace Log option is supported and the trid argument refers
to a pre-recorded trace stream, the status shall be the
status of the com- pleted trace stream.</p>

<p>Each time the posix_trace_get_status() function is used,
the overrun status of the trace stream shall be reset to
POSIX_TRACE_NO_OVERRUN immediately after the call completes.
If the Trace Log option is sup- ported, the
posix_trace_get_status() function shall behave the same as
when the option is not supported except for the following
differences:</p>

<p>* If the trid argument refers to a trace stream with
log, each time the posix_trace_get_status() function is
used, the log overrun sta- tus of the trace stream shall be
reset to POSIX_TRACE_NO_OVERRUN and the flush_error status
shall be reset to zero immediately after the call
completes.</p>

<p>* If the trid argument refers to a pre-recorded trace
stream, the sta- tus returned shall be the status of the
completed trace stream and the status values of the trace
stream shall not be reset.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, these functions
shall return a value of zero. Otherwise, they shall return
the corresponding error number.</p>

<p>The posix_trace_get_attr() function stores the trace
attributes in the object pointed to by attr, if
successful.</p>

<p>The posix_trace_get_status() function stores the trace
status in the object pointed to by statusinfo, if
successful.</p>

<p>ERRORS These functions shall fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The trace stream argument trid does not
correspond to a valid active trace stream or a valid trace
log.</p>
