<p>NAME arbitron - arbitron mailboxes</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS arbitron [ -C config-file ] [ -o ] [ -u ] [ -l
] [ -p months ] [ -d days | -D mmddyyyy[:mmddyyyy] ]
mailbox...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Arbitron collects and reports readership
statistics for mailboxes on the server. It also optionally
prunes the mailboxes of n state for dormant users.</p>

<p>Arbitron produces one line of output per mailbox,
reporting the mailbox name followed by a space, followed by
the number of readers (and if -u is specified, followed by a
colon and a comma-separated list of the readers userids),
and if -o is not specified, another space and the number of
subscribers (and if -u is specified, followed by a colon and
a comma-separated list of the subscribers userids).
IMPORTANT: This format is subject to change in future
versions.</p>

<p>Each &quot;reader&quot; is a distinct authentication
identity which has &quot;s&quot; rights to the mailbox and
which has SELECTed the mailbox within either the past days
days or the specified date range. Users are not counted as
reading their own personal mailboxes. Personal mailboxes are
not reported unless there is at least one reader other than
the mailboxes owner.</p>

<p>Arbitron reads its configuration options out of the
imapd.conf(5) file unless specified otherwise by -C.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -C config-file Read configuration options from
config-file.</p>

<p>-o &quot;old way&quot; -- do not report subscribers.</p>

<p>-u Report userids in addition to the count(s).</p>

<p>-l Enable long reporting (comma delimited table
consisting of mbox, userid, r/s, start time, end time).</p>

<p>-d days Count as a reader an authentication identity
which has SELECTed the mailbox within days days. Default is
30.</p>

<p>-D mmddyyyy[:mmddyyyy] Count as a reader an
authentication identity which has SELECTed the mailbox
within the given date range. The start date and optional end
date are specified as 2-digit month of the year, 2-digit day
of the month, and 4-digit year. If the end date is not
specified, then the current system time is used as the end
time.</p>

<p>-p months Prune n state for users who have not SELECTed
the mailbox within months months. Default is infinity.</p>
