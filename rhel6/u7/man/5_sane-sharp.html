<p>sane-sharp(5) SANE Scanner Access Now Easy
sane-sharp(5)</p>

<p>NAME sane-sharp - SANE backend for SHARP scanners</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sane-sharp library implements a SANE
(Scanner Access Now Easy) backend that provides access to
Sharp SCSI scanners. This backend should be considered
beta-quality software! In the current state it is known to
work with JX-610 and JX-250 scanners. It is prepared for
usage with the JX-330 series scanners, but we are not able
to test it with these devices.</p>

<p>For other Sharp scanners, it may or may not work.</p>

<p>At present, the following scanners are known to work
with this backend.</p>

<p>Vendor Product id: ----- ----------- Sharp JX-610 Sharp
JX-250 Sharp JX-320 Sharp JX-330 Sharp JX-350</p>

<p>The following scanners are detected by the backend, but
not tested:</p>

<p>Vendor Product id: ----- ----------- Sharp JX-325</p>

<p>DEVICE NAMES This backend expects device names of the
form:</p>

<p>special</p>

<p>Where special is either the path-name for the special
device that cor- responds to a SCSI scanner. The special
device name must be a generic SCSI device or a symlink to
such a device. Under Linux, such a device name could be
/dev/sga or /dev/sge, for example. See sane-scsi(5) for
details.</p>

<p>SCAN OPTIONS Scan Mode (parameter --mode for scanimage).
Possible settings: Lineart (1 bit black &amp; white scans),
Gray (8 bit gray scale scans), Lineart Color (bi-level color
scans), Color (8 bit RGB scans). The default value is
Color.</p>

<p>Halftone Pattern (parameter --halftone-pattern for
scanimage). Avail- able only for the JX-330 series scanners.
Possible settings: none Dither Bayer Dither Spiral Dither
Dispersed Error Diffusion The default value is none.</p>

<p>Paper Source (parameter --source for scanimage). This
option is only available, if an automatic document feeder or
a transparency adapter is installed. Possible settings:
Flatbed Automatic Document Feeder Transparency Adapter If an
ADF or a transparency adapter is installed, using it is the
default selection.</p>

<p>Custom Gamma (parameter --custom-gamma for scanimage).
This option determines whether a builtin or a custom
gamma-table is used. Possible settings: yes enables custom
gamma tables no enables a built gamma table</p>

only available, if Custom Gamma is set to no. Possible
values: 1.0 2.2 The default value is 2.2. (The JX-250 and
JX-350 have no built in gamma correction; for these scanner,
a gamma table is downloaded to the scan- ner by the
backend.)</p>

<p>Gamma Table (parameter --gamma-table for scanimage).
Allowed values: 0..255; 256 numbers must be defined. The
default values are 0, 1, 2, .. 255 (i.e., gamma == 1). This
table is only used for gray scale scans.</p>

30..400 (JX-250) The default value is 150.</p>

<p>Scan Window</p>

<p>The possible settings depend on the scanner model and,
for the JX-250 and the JX-350, also on the usage of the
automatic document feeder resp. the transparency adapter.
Please refer to the values allowed by xscanimage, or xsane.
With scanimage, enter one of the following com- mands:</p>

<p>scanimage -d sharp --source &quot;Automatic Document
Feeder&quot; --help</p>

<p>scanimage -d sharp --source Flatbed --help</p>

<p>ADF USAGE If a paper jam occurred, the maintenance cover
must be opened and closed, even if the jammed paper can be
removed without opening the maintenance cover. Otherwise,
the error condition cannot be cleared.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION The contents of the sharp.conf file is a
list of options and device names that correspond to Sharp
scanners. Empty lines and lines begin- ning with a hash mark
(#) are ignored. See sane-scsi(5) for details about device
names.</p>

<p>Lines setting an option start with the key word option,
followed by the option s name and the options value. At
present, three options are defined: buffers, buffersize, and
readqueue.</p>

<p>Options defined at the start of sharp.conf apply to all
devices; options defined after a device name apply to this
device.</p>

<p>The options buffers and readqueue are only significant
if the backend has been compiled so that for each scan a
second process is forked (switch USE_FORK in sharp.c ). This
process reads the scan data from the scanner and writes this
data into a block of shared memory. The parent process reads
the data from this memory block and delivers it to the
frontend. The options control the size and usage of this
shared memory block.</p>

<p>option buffers defines the number of buffers used. The
smallest number allowed is 2.</p>

<p>option buffersize defines the size of one buffer. Since
each buffer is filled with a single read command sent to the
scanner, its size is lim- ited automatically to the size
allowed by the operating system or by the Sane SCSI library
for SCSI read commands. A buffer size of 128 kB or 256 kB is
recommended for scan resolutions of 300 dpi and above.</p>

<p>option readqueue defines how many read commands to be
sent to the scan- ner are queued. At present, the Sane SCSI
library supports queued read commands only for for Linux.
For other operating systems, option read- queue should be
set to 0. For Linux, option readqueue should be set to 2.
Larger values than 2 for option readqueue are not reasonable
in most cases. option buffers should be greater than option
readqueue.</p>

<p>Performance Considerations This section focuses on the
problem of stops of the scanners carriage during a scan.
Carriage stops happen mainly with the JX-250. This scan- ner
has obviously only a small internal buffer compared to its
speed. That means that the backend must read the data as
fast as possible from the scanner in order to avoid carriage
stops.</p>

<p>Even the JX-250 needs only less than 10 seconds for a
400 dpi A4 gray scale scan, which results in a data transfer
rate of more than 1.6 MB per second. This means that the
data produced by the scanner must be processed fairly fast.
Due to the small internal buffer of the JX-250, the backend
must issue a read request for the next data block as soon as
possible after reading a block of data in order to avoid
carriage stops.</p>

<p>Stops of the carriage can be caused by the following
reasons:</p>

<p>- too much &quot;traffic&quot; on the SCSI bus - slow
responses by the backend to the scanner, - a program which
processes the data acquired by the backend too slow.</p>

<p>Too much &quot;traffic&quot; on the SCSI bus: This
happens for example, if hard disks are connected to the same
SCSI bus as the scanner, and when data transfer from/to
these hard disks requires a considerable part of the SCSI
bandwidth during a scan. If this is the case, you should
consider to connect the scanner to a separate SCSI
adapter.</p>

<p>Slow responses by the backend to the scanner:
Unfortunately, Unix-like operating systems generally have no
real time capabilities. Thus there is no guarantee that the
backend is under any circumstances able to communicate with
the scanner as fast as required. To minimize this problem,
the backend should be compiled so that a separate reader
pro- cess is forked: Make sure that USE_FORK is defined when
you compile sharp.c. If slow responses of the backend remain
to be problem, you could try to reduce the load of the
system. Even while the backend and the reader process need
only a minor amount of processor time, other running
processes can cause an increase in the time delay between
two time slices given to the reader process. On slower
systems, such an increased delay can be enough to cause a
carriage stop with the JX-250. For Linux, the usage of the
SG driver version 2.1.36 or above is recom- mended, because
it supports, in combination with the SCSI library of Sane
version 1.0.2, command queueing within the kernel. This
queueing implementation, combined with a buffer size of at
least 128 kB, should avoid most carriage stops.</p>

<p>Slow processing of the scan data: An example for this
situation is the access to the scanner via a 10 MBit
Ethernet, which is definitely too slow to transfer the scan
data as fast as they are produced by the scanner. If you
have enough memory available, you can increase option
buffers, so that an entire image can be stored in these
buffers.</p>

<p>In order to see, if the backend is too slow or if the
further process- ing of the data is too slow, set the
environment variable SANE_DEBUG_SHARP to 1. When a scan is
finished, the backend writes the line &quot;buffer full
conditions: nn&quot; to stderr. If nn is zero, carriage
stops are caused by too slow responses of the backend or too
much &quot;traffic&quot; on the SCSI bus. If nn is greater
than zero, the backend had to wait nn times until a buffer
has been processed by the frontend. (Please note that option
buffers must be greater than option readqueue in order to
get useful output for &quot;buffer full
conditions&quot;.)</p>

<p>FILES /etc/sane.d/sharp.conf The backend configuration
file.</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-sharp.a The static library
implementing this backend.</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-sharp.so The shared library
implementing this backend (present on systems that support
dynamic loading).</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT SANE_DEBUG_SHARP If the library was compiled
with debug support enabled, this environment variable
controls the debug level for this backend. E.g., a value of
128 requests all debug output to be printed. Smaller levels
reduce verbosity.</p>

<p>KNOWN PROBLEMS 1. ADF Mode After several ADF scans, the
scanner moves the carriage back to the idle position and
back to ADF scan position, before a scan starts. We do not
know, if this is a problem of the scanner, or if this is a
bug of the backend. At present, the scanner must power off
and on to stop this annoying behaviour.</p>

<p>2. Threshold level does not work (only JX-610)</p>

<p>3. The maximum resolution is limited to 600 dpi(JX-610
supported to 1200 dpi) resp. 400 dpi (JX-250)</p>

<p>4. If the JX250 is used with an ADF, the following
situation can occur: After several scans, the scanner moves,
after loading a new sheet of paper, the carriage to the idle
position, and then back to the position used for ADF scans.
This happens for every scan, in contrast to the calibration,
which is done after 10 scans. (For the calibration, the
carriage is also moved to the idle position.) We do not
know, if this behavior is caused by the backend, or if it is
a bug in the firmware of the scanner.</p>

<p>5. Usage of a transparency adapter (film scan unit) is
supported, but not tested.</p>
