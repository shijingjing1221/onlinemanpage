<p>NAME ntp.conf - Server Options</p>

<p>Following is a description of the configuration commands
in NTPv4. There are two classes of commands, configuration
commands that config- ure an association with a remote
server, peer or reference clock, and auxilliary commands
that specify environmental variables that control various
related operations.</p>

<p>The various modes described on the Association
Management page are determined by the command keyword and
the DNS name or IP address. Addresses are classed by type as
(s) a remote server or peer (IPv4 class A, B and C), (b) the
IP broadcast address of a local interface, (m) a multicast
address (IPv4 class D), or (r) a reference clock address
(127.127.x.x). For type m addresses the IANA has assigned
the multicast group address IPv4 224.0.1.1 and IPv6
ff05::101 (site local) exclusively to NTP, but other
nonconflicting addresses can be used.</p>

<p>If the Basic Socket Interface Extensions for IPv6
(RFC-2553) is detected, support for the IPv6 address family
is generated in addition to the default IPv4 address family.
IPv6 addresses can be identified by the presence of colons
&quot;:&quot; in the address field. IPv6 addresses can be
used almost everywhere where IPv4 addresses can be used,
with the exception of reference clock addresses, which are
always IPv4. Note that in contexts where a host name is
expected, a -4 qualifier preced- ing the host name forces
DNS resolution to the IPv4 namespace, while a -6 qualifier
forces DNS resolution to the IPv6 namespace.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION COMMANDS server address [options ...]</p>

<p>peer address [options ...]</p>

<p>broadcast address [options ...]</p>

<p>manycastclient address [options ...]</p>

<p>pool address [options ...]</p>

<p>unpeer [address | associd] These commands specify the
time server name or address to be used and the mode in which
to operate. The address can be either a DNS name or a IPv4
or IPv6 address in standard nota- tion. In general, multiple
commands of each type can be used for different server and
peer addresses or multicast groups.</p>

<p>server For type s and r addresses (only), this command
mobi- lizes a persistent client mode association with the
specified remote server or local reference clock. If the
preempt flag is specified, a preemptable client mode
association is mobilized instead.</p>

<p>peer For type s addresses (only), this command mobilizes
a persistent symmetric-active mode association with the
specified remote peer.</p>

<p>broadcast For type b and m addressees (only), this
command mobi- lizes a persistent broadcast or multicast
server mode association. Note that type b messages go only
to the interface specified, but type m messages go to all
interfaces.</p>

<p>manycastclient For type m addresses (only), this command
mobilizes a manycast client mode association for the
multicast group address specified. In this mode the address
must match the address specified on the manycastserver com-
mand of one or more designated manycast servers.</p>

<p>pool For type s messages (only) this command mobilizes a
client mode association for servers implementing the pool
automatic server discovery scheme described on the
Association Management page. The address is a DNS name in
the form area.pool.ntp.org, where area is a quali- fier
designating the server geographic area such as us or
europe.</p>

<p>unpeer This command removes a previously configured
associa- tion. An address or association ID can be used to
iden- tify the association. Either an IP address or DNS name
can be used. This command is most useful when supplied via
ntpq runtime configuration commands :config and
config-from-file.</p>

<p>COMMAND OPTIONS autokey Send and receive packets
authenticated by the Autokey scheme described in the
Authentication Options page. This option is mutually
exclusive with the key option.</p>

<p>burst When the server is reachable, send a burst of
eight packets instead of the usual one. The packet spacing
is normally 2 s; however, the spacing between the first and
second packets can be changed with the calldelay command to
allow additional time for a modem or ISDN call to complete.
This option is valid only with the server command and type s
addressesa. It is a recom- mended option when the maxpoll
option is greater than 10 (1024 s).</p>

<p>iburst When the server is unreachable, send a burst of
eight packets instead of the usual one. The packet spacing
is normally 2 s; however, the spacing between the first and
second packets can be changed with the calldelay command to
allow additional time for a modem or ISDN call to complete.
This option is valid only with the server command and type s
addresses. It is a recom- mended option with this
command.</p>

<p>key key Send and receive packets authenticated by the
symmetric key scheme described in the Authentication Options
page. The key specifies the key identifier with values from
1 to 65534, inclusive. This option is mutually exclusive
with the autokey option.</p>

<p>minpoll minpoll</p>

<p>maxpoll maxpoll These options specify the minimum and
maximum poll intervals for NTP messages, in seconds as a
power of two. The maximum poll interval defaults to 10 (1024
s), but can be increased by the maxpoll option to an upper
limit of 17 (36 h). The minimum poll interval defaults to 6
(64 s), but can be decreased by the minpoll option to a
lower limit of 3 (8 s).</p>

<p>mode option Pass the option to a reference clock driver,
where option is an integer in the range from 0 to 255,
inclusive. This option is valid only with type r
addresses.</p>

<p>noselect Marks the server or peer to be ignored by the
selection algo- rithm but visible to the monitoring program.
This option is ignored with the broadcast command.</p>

<p>preempt Specifies the association as preemptable rather
than the default persistent. This option is ignored with the
broadcast command and is most useful with the manycastclient
and pool commands.</p>

<p>prefer Mark the server as preferred. All other things
being equal, this host will be chosen for synchronization
among a set of correctly operating hosts. See the Mitigation
Rules and the prefer Keyword page for further information.
This option is valid only with the server and peer
commands.</p>

<p>true Mark the association to assume truechimer status;
that is, always survive the selection and clustering
algorithms. This option can be used with any association,
but is most useful for reference clocks with large jitter on
the serial port and pre- cision pulse-per-second (PPS)
signals. Caution: this option defeats the algorithms
designed to cast out falsetickers and can allow these
sources to set the system clock. This option is valid only
with the server and peer commands.</p>

<p>ttl ttl This option specifies the time-to-live ttl for
the broadcast command and the maximum ttl for the expanding
ring search used by the manycastclient command. Selection of
the proper value, which defaults to 127, is something of a
black art and should be coordinated with the network
administrator. This option is invalid with type r
addresses.</p>

<p>version version Specifies the version number to be used
f or outgoing NTP pack- ets. Versions 1-4 are the choices,
with version 4 the default.</p>

<p>xleave Operate in interleaved mode (symmetric and
broadcast modes only). (see NTP Interleaved Modes)</p>

<p>AUXILLIARY COMMANDS broadcastclient Enable reception of
broadcast server messages to any local interface (type b
address). Ordinarily, upon receiving a broad- cast message
for the first time, the broadcast client measures the
nominal server propagation delay using a brief client/server
exchange, after which it continues in listen-only mode. If a
nonzero value is specified in the broadcastdelay command,
the value becomes the delay and the volley is not exe-
cuted. Note: the novolley option has been deprecated for
future enhancements. Note that, in order to avoid accidental
or mali- cious disruption in this mode, both the server and
client should operate using symmetric key or public key
authentication as described in the Authentication Options
page. Note that the novolley keyword is incompatible with
public key authentica- tion.</p>

<p>manycastserver address [...] Enable reception of
manycast client messages (type m)to the multicast group
address(es) (type m) specified. At least one address is
required. Note that, in order to avoid accidental or
malicious disruption, both the server and client should
operate using symmetric key or public key authentication as
described in the Authentication Options page.</p>

<p>multicastclient address [...] Enable reception of
multicast server messages to the multicast group address(es)
(type m) specified. Upon receiving a message for the first
time, the multicast client measures the nominal server
propagation delay using a brief client/server exchange with
the server, then enters the broadcast client mode, in which
it synchronizes to succeeding multicast messages. Note that,
in order to avoid accidental or malicious disruption in this
mode, both the server and client should operate using sym-
metric key or public key authentication as described in the
Authentication Options page.</p>

<p>BUGS The syntax checking is not picky; some combinations
of ridiculous and even hilarious options and modes may not
be detected.</p>
