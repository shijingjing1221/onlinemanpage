<p>Tcl_RecordAndEvalObj(3) Tcl Library Procedures
Tcl_RecordAndEvalObj(3)</p>


<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME Tcl_RecordAndEvalObj - save command on history list
before evaluating</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tcl.h&gt;</p>

<p>int Tcl_RecordAndEvalObj(interp, cmdPtr, flags)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS Tcl_Interp *interp (in) Tcl interpreter in
which to evaluate command.</p>

<p>Tcl_Obj *cmdPtr (in) Points to a Tcl object containing a
command (or sequence of commands) to execute.</p>

<p>int flags (in) An ORed combination of flag bits.
TCL_NO_EVAL means record the command but do not evaluate it.
TCL_EVAL_GLOBAL means evaluate the command at global level
instead of the current stack level.
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Tcl_RecordAndEvalObj is invoked to record a
command as an event on the history list and then execute it
using Tcl_EvalObjEx (or Tcl_GlobalE- valObj if the
TCL_EVAL_GLOBAL bit is set in flags). It returns a com-
pletion code such as TCL_OK just like Tcl_EvalObjEx, as well
as a result object containing additional information (a
result value or error message) that can be retrieved using
Tcl_GetObjResult. If you do not want the command recorded on
the history list then you should invoke Tcl_EvalObjEx
instead of Tcl_RecordAndEvalObj. Normally
Tcl_RecordAndEvalObj is only called with top-level commands
typed by the user, since the purpose of history is to allow
the user to re-issue recently invoked commands. If the flags
argument contains the TCL_NO_EVAL bit then the command is
recorded without being evaluated.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO Tcl_EvalObjEx, Tcl_GetObjResult</p>

<p>KEYWORDS command, event, execute, history, interpreter,
object, record</p>
