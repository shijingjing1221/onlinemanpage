<p>NAME TIFFWriteScanline - write a scanline to an open
TIFF file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tiffio.h&gt;</p>

<p>int TIFFWriteScanline(TIFF *tif, tdata_t buf, uint32
row, tsample_t sample)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Write data to a file at the specified row.
The sample parameter is used only if data are organized in
separate planes (PlanarConfiguration=2). The data are
assumed to be uncompressed and in the native bit- and
byte-order of the host machine. The data written to the file
is com- pressed according to the compression scheme of the
current TIFF direc- tory (see further below). If the current
scanline is past the end of the current subfile, the
ImageLength field is automatically increased to include the
scanline (except for PlanarConfiguration=2, where the
ImageLength cannot be changed once the first data are
written). If the ImageLength is increased, the StripOffsets
and StripByteCounts fields are similarly enlarged to reflect
data written past the previous end of image.</p>

<p>NOTES The library writes encoded data using the native
machine byte order. Correctly implemented TIFF readers are
expected to do any necessary byte-swapping to correctly
process image data with BitsPerSample greater than 8. The
library attempts to hide bit-ordering differences between
the image and the native machine by converting data from the
native machine order.</p>

<p>In C++ the sample parameter defaults to 0.</p>

<p>Once data are written to a file for the current
directory, the values of certain tags may not be altered;
see TIFFSetField(3TIFF) for more information.</p>

<p>It is not possible to write scanlines to a file that
uses a tiled orga- nization. The routine TIFFIsTiled can be
used to determine if the file is organized as tiles or
strips.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUES TIFFWriteScanline returns -1 if it
immediately detects an error and 1 for a successful
write.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS All error messages are directed to the
TIFFError(3TIFF) routine.</p>

<p>%s: File not open for writing . The file was opened for
reading, not writing.</p>

<p>Can not write scanlines to a tiled image. An attempt was
made to write a scanline to a tiled image. The image is
assumed to be organized in tiles because the TileWidth and
TileLength tags have been set with TIFFSetField(3TIFF).</p>

<p>Compression algorithm does not support random access.
Data was written in a non-sequential order to a file that
uses a compression algorithm and that has RowsPerStrip
greater than one. That is, data in the image is to be stored
in a compressed form, and with multiple rows packed into a
strip. In this case, the library does not support random
access to the data. The data should either be written as
entire strips, sequentially by rows, or the value of
RowsPerStrip should be set to one.</p>

<p>%s: Must set &quot;ImageWidth&quot; before writing data.
The images width has not be set before the first write. See
TIFFSetField(3TIFF) for infor- mation on how to do this.</p>

<p>%s: Must set &quot;PlanarConfiguration&quot; before
writing data. The organiza- tion of data has not be defined
before the first write. See TIFFSet- Field(3TIFF) for
information on how to do this.</p>

<p>Can not change &quot;ImageLength&quot; when using
separate planes. Separate image planes are being used
(PlanarConfiguration=2), but the number of rows has not been
specified before the first write. The library supports the
dynamic growth of an image only when data are organized in a
contiguous manner (PlanarConfiguration=1).</p>

<p>%d: Sample out of range, max %d. The sample parameter
was greater than the value of the SamplesPerPixel tag.</p>

<p>%s: No space for strip arrays . There was not enough
space for the arrays that hold strip offsets and byte
counts.</p>

<p>BUGS Writing subsampled YCbCR data does not work
correctly because, for Pla- narConfiguration=2 the size of a
scanline is not calculated on a per- sample basis, and for
PlanarConfiguration=1 the library does not pack the
block-interleaved samples.</p>
