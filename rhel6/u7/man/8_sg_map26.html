<p>SG_MAP26(8) SG3_UTILS SG_MAP26(8)</p>

<p>NAME sg_map26 - maps a special file to a SCSI generic
(sg) device (or vice versa)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sg_map26 [--dev_dir=DIR] [--given_is=0|1]
[--help] [--result=0|1|2|3] [--symlink] [--verbose]
[--version] DEVICE</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Maps a special file (block or char)
associated with a SCSI device to the corresponding SCSI
generic (sg) device, or vice versa. Can also be given a
sysfs file, for example /sys/block/sda or
/sys/block/sda/dev.</p>

<p>Rather than map to or from a sg device, the sysfs file
name matching a given device special file (or vice versa)
can be requested. This is done with --result=2 and
--result=3. This feature works on ATA devices (e.g. dev/hdc)
as well as SCSI devices.</p>

<p>In this utility, &quot;mapped&quot; refers to finding
the relationship between a SCSI generic (sg) node and the
higher level SCSI device name; or vice versa. For example
/dev/sg0 may &quot;map&quot; to /dev/sda . Mappings may not
exist, if a relevant module is not loaded, for example. Also
there are SCSI devices that can only be accessed via a sg
node (e.g. SAF-TE and some SES devices).</p>

<p>In this utility, &quot;matching&quot; refers to
different representations of the same device accessed via
the same driver. For example, /dev/hdc and /sys/block/hdc
usually refer to the same device and thus would be
considered matching. A related example is that /dev/cdrom
and /dev/hdc are also considered matching if /dev/cdrom is a
symlink to /dev/hdc.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Arguments to long options are mandatory for
short options as well.</p>

<p>-d, --dev_dir=DIR where DIR is the directory to search
for resultant device spe- cial files in (or symlinks to
same). Only active when --result=0 (the default) or
--result=2. If this option is not given and DEVICE is a
device special file then the directory part of DEVICE is
assumed. If this option is not given and DEVICE is a sysfs
name, then if necessary /dev is assumed as the
directory.</p>

<p>-g, --given_is=0 | 1 specifies the DEVICE is either a
device special file (when the argument is 0), or a sysfs dev
file (when the argument is 1). The parent directory of a
sysfs dev file is also accepted (e.g. either
/sys/block/sda/dev or /sys/block/sda are accepted). Usually
there is no need to give this option since this utility
first checks for special files (or symlinks to spe- cial
files) and if not, assumes it has been given a sysfs dev
file (or its parent). Generates an error if given and
disagrees with variety of DEVICE.</p>

<p>-h, --help output the usage message then exit.</p>

<p>-r, --result=0 | 1 | 2 | 3 specifies what variety of
file (or files) that this utility tries to find. The default
is a &quot;mapped&quot; device special file, when the
argument is 0. When the argument is 1, this utility tries to
find the &quot;mapped&quot; sysfs node name. When the
argument is 2, this utility tries to find the
&quot;matching&quot; device special file. When the argument
is 3, this utility tries to find the &quot;matching&quot;
sysfs node name.</p>

<p>-s, --symlink when a device special file is being sought
(i.e. when --result=0 (the default) or --result=2) then also
look for symlinks to that device special file in the same
directory.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose increase the level of verbosity, (i.e.
debug output).</p>

<p>-V, --version print the version string and then
exit.</p>

<p>NOTES This utility is designed for the linux 2.6 kernel
series. It uses spe- cial file major and minor numbers (and
whether the special is block or character) together with
sysfs to do its mapping or matching. In the absence of any
other information, device special files are assumed to be in
the /dev directory while sysfs is assumed to be mounted at
/sys. Device names in sysfs are predictable, given the
corresponding major and minor number of the device. However,
due to udev rules, the name of device special files can be
anything the user desires (e.g. /dev/sda could be named
/dev/my_boot_disk). When trying to find a resultant device
special file, this utility uses the major and minor numbers
(and whether a block or char device is sought) to search the
device directory.</p>

<p>This utility only shows one relationship at a time. To
get an overview of all SCSI devices, with special file names
and optionally the &quot;mapped&quot; sg device name, see
the lsscsi utility.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Assume sg2 maps to sdb while dvd, cdrom and hdc
are all matching.</p>

<p># sg_map26 /dev/sg2 /dev/sdb</p>

<p># sg_map26 /dev/sdb /dev/sg2</p>

<p># sg_map26 --result=0 /dev/sdb /dev/sg2</p>

<p># sg_map26 --result=3 /dev/sdb /sys/block/sda</p>

<p># sg_map26 --result=1 /dev/sdb
/sys/class/scsi_generic/sg0</p>

<p>Now look at /dev/hdc and friends</p>

<p># sg_map26 /dev/hdc &lt;error: a hd device does not map
to a sg device&gt;</p>

<p># sg_map26 --result=3 /dev/hdc /sys/block/hdc</p>

<p># sg_map26 --result=2 /dev/hdc /dev/hdc</p>

<p># sg_map26 --result=2 --symlink /dev/hdc /dev/cdrom
/dev/dvd /dev/hdc</p>

<p># sg_map26 --result=2 --symlink /sys/block/hdc
/dev/cdrom /dev/dvd /dev/hdc</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The exit status of sg_map26 is 0 when it is
successful. Otherwise see the sg3_utils(8) man page.</p>
