<p>NAME pamsharpness - measure the sharpness of a PNM/PAM
image</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pamsharpness [imagefile]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pamsharpness reads a Netpbm image (PNM or PAM) and
prints a number that tells how sharp it is.</p>

<p>Sharpness is a measure of how suddenly (in space) colors
change in the image. pamsharpness computes the sharpness of
the image as the average difference in intensity between
each pixel and its 8 surrounding pix- els, in each of the
color components (R, G, B).</p>

<p>pamsharpness does not include the edges of the image,
where there are not 8 pixels surrounding a pixel, in its
computation.</p>

<p>pamsharpness assumes that the image is a PNM or PNM
equivalent PAM. If it isnt, the results are not necessarily
meaningful.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO pamsharpmap(1), pammasksharpen(1), pam(1),
pnm(1)</p>

<p>HISTORY pamsharpness was added to Netpbm in Release
10.21 (March 2004). Bryan Henderson derived it from the
program pnmsharp by B.W. van Schooten and distributed as
part of the Photopnmtools package.</p>
