<p>NAME consolehelper - A wrapper that helps console users
run system programs</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS progname [ options ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION consolehelper is a tool that makes it easy
for console users to run system programs, doing
authentication via PAM (which can be set up to trust all
console users or to ask for a password at the system
adminis- trators discretion). When possible, the
authentication is done graph- ically; otherwise, it is done
within the text console from which con- solehelper was
started.</p>

<p>It is intended to be completely transparent. This means
that the user will never run the consolehelper program
directly. Instead, programs like /sbin/shutdown are paired
with a link from /usr/bin/shutdown to
/usr/bin/consolehelper. Then when non-root users
(specifically, users without /sbin in their path, or /sbin
after /usr/bin) call the &quot;shut- down&quot; program,
consolehelper will be invoked to authenticate the action and
then invoke /sbin/shutdown. (consolehelper itself has no
priv- iledges; it calls the userhelper(8) program do the
real work.)</p>

<p>consolehelper requires that a PAM configuration for
every managed pro- gram exist. So to make /sbin/foo or
/usr/sbin/foo managed, you need to create a link from
/usr/bin/foo to /usr/bin/consolehelper and create the file
/etc/pam.d/foo, normally using the pam_console(8) PAM
module.</p>

<p>OPTIONS This program has no command line options of its
own; it passes all com- mand line options on to the program
it is calling.</p>
