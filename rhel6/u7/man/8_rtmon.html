<p>RTMON(8) RTMON(8)</p>

<p>NAME rtmon - listens to and monitors RTnetlink</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rtmon [ options ] file FILE [ all |
LISTofOBJECTS ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page documents briefly the rtmon
command.</p>

<p>rtmon listens on netlink socket and monitors routing
table changes.</p>

<p>rtmon can be started before the first network
configuration command is issued. For example if you
insert:</p>

<p>rtmon file /var/log/rtmon.log</p>

<p>in a startup script, you will be able to view the full
history later. Certainly, it is possible to start rtmon at
any time. It prepends the history with the state snapshot
dumped at the moment of starting.</p>

<p>OPTIONS rtmon supports the following options:</p>

<p>-Version Print version and exit.</p>

<p>help Show summary of options.</p>

<p>file FILE [ all | LISTofOBJECTS ] Log output to FILE.
LISTofOBJECTS is the list of object types that we want to
monitor. It may contain link, address, route and all. link
specifies the network device, address the protocol (IP or
IPv6) address on a device, route the routing table entry and
all does what the name says.</p>

<p>-family [ inet | inet6 | link | help ] Specify protocol
family. inet is IPv4, inet6 is IPv6, link means that no
networking protocol is involved and help prints usage
information.</p>

<p>-4 Use IPv4. Shortcut for -family inet.</p>

<p>-6 Use IPv6. Shortcut for -family inet6.</p>

<p>-0 Use a special family identifier meaning that no
networking pro- tocol is involved. Shortcut for -family
link.</p>

<p>USAGE EXAMPLES # rtmon file /var/log/rtmon.log Log to
file /var/log/rtmon.log, then run:</p>

<p># ip monitor file /var/log/rtmon.log to display logged
output from file.</p>
