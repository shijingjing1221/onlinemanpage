<p>SIGSUSPEND(2) Linux Programmer s Manual
SIGSUSPEND(2)</p>

<p>NAME sigsuspend - wait for a signal</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;signal.h&gt;</p>

<p>int sigsuspend(const sigset_t *mask);</p>

<p>Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
feature_test_macros(7)):</p>

<p>sigsuspend(): _POSIX_C_SOURCE &gt;= 1 || _XOPEN_SOURCE
|| _POSIX_SOURCE</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION sigsuspend() temporarily replaces the signal
mask of the calling pro- cess with the mask given by mask
and then suspends the process until delivery of a signal
whose action is to invoke a signal handler or to terminate a
process.</p>

<p>If the signal terminates the process, then sigsuspend()
does not return. If the signal is caught, then sigsuspend()
returns after the signal handler returns, and the signal
mask is restored to the state before the call to
sigsuspend().</p>

<p>It is not possible to block SIGKILL or SIGSTOP;
specifying these sig- nals in mask, has no effect on the
processs signal mask.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE sigsuspend() always returns -1, normally
with the error EINTR.</p>

<p>ERRORS EFAULT mask points to memory which is not a valid
part of the process address space.</p>

<p>EINTR The call was interrupted by a signal.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>NOTES Normally, sigsuspend() is used in conjunction with
sigprocmask(2) in order to prevent delivery of a signal
during the execution of a criti- cal code section. The
caller first blocks the signals with sigproc- mask(2). When
the critical code has completed, the caller then waits for
the signals by calling sigsuspend() with the signal mask
that was returned by sigprocmask(2) (in the oldset
argument).</p>

<p>See sigsetops(3) for details on manipulating signal
sets.</p>
