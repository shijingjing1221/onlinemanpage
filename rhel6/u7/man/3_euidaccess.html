<p>EUIDACCESS(3) Linux Programmer s Manual
EUIDACCESS(3)</p>

<p>NAME euidaccess, eaccess - check effective user s
permissions for a file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #define _GNU_SOURCE #include
&lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>int euidaccess(const char *pathname, int mode); int
eaccess(const char *pathname, int mode);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Like access(2), euidaccess() checks
permissions and existence of the file identified by its
argument pathname. However, whereas access(2), performs
checks using the real user and group identifiers of the pro-
cess, euidaccess() uses the effective identifiers.</p>

<p>mode is a mask consisting of one or more of R_OK, W_OK,
X_OK and F_OK, with the same meanings as for access(2).</p>

<p>eaccess() is a synonym for euidaccess(), provided for
compatibility with some other systems.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success (all requested permissions
granted), zero is returned. On error (at least one bit in
mode asked for a permission that is denied, or some other
error occurred), -1 is returned, and errno is set appro-
priately.</p>

<p>ERRORS As for access(2).</p>

<p>VERSIONS The eaccess() function was added to glibc in
version 2.4.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO These functions are non-standard. Some
other systems have an eaccess() function.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO access(2), chmod(2), chown(2), faccessat(2),
open(2), setgid(2), setuid(2), stat(2), credentials(7),
path_resolution(7)</p>
