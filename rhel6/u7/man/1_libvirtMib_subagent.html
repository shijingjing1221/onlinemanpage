<p>NAME libvirtMib_subagent - SNMP subagent for libvirt</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS libvirtMib_subagent [OPTIONS] [LISTENING
ADDRESSES]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The libvirtMib_subagent provides SNMP
functionality for libvirt. Therefore it is now possible to
gather and set domain status over SNMP from one place. This
allows to create views of entire platforms end to end.</p>

<p>It communicates with SNMP agent over AgentX protocol
(RFC 2741) and extends agents set of infomation provided.
Therefore, we need a running SNMP agent. This behaviour can
be avoided using -M option.</p>

<p>The libvirtMib_subagent understands these OPTIONS:</p>

<p>-f Dont fork. Run in foreground.</p>

<p>-D[token[,...]] Turn on debugging output for the given
TOKEN(s). Without any tokens specified, it defaults to
printing all the tokens (which is equivalent to the keyword
&quot;ALL&quot;). You might want to try ALL for extremely
verbose output. Note: You cant put a space between the -D
and the tokens.</p>

<p>-H Display a list of configuration file directives
understood by the agent and then exit.</p>

<p>-M Run as a normal SNMP Agent instead of an AgentX
sub-agent.</p>

<p>-xADDRESS Connect to master agent at ADDRESS (default
&quot;/var/agentx/master&quot;). The address can either be a
Unix domain socket path, or the address of a network
interface. The format is the same as the format of listening
addresses described below.</p>

<p>-L Do not open a log file; print all messages to
stderr.</p>

<p>The last optional LISTENING ADDRESSES specify on which
addresses should subagent running in normal SNMP Agent mode
listen for incoming requests. See snmpd for further
information.</p>

<p>BUGS Report any bugs discovered to the libvirt community
via the mailing list
&quot;http://libvirt.org/contact.html&quot; or bug tracker
&quot;http://libvirt.org/bugs.html&quot;. Alternatively
report bugs to your software distributor / vendor.</p>
