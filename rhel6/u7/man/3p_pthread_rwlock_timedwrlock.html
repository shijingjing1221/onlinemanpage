<p>PTHREAD_RWLOCK_TIMEDWRLOCK(POSIX Programmer s
MaPTHREAD_RWLOCK_TIMEDWRLOCK(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME pthread_rwlock_timedwrlock - lock a read-write lock
for writing</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;pthread.h&gt; #include
&lt;time.h&gt;</p>

<p>int pthread_rwlock_timedwrlock(pthread_rwlock_t
*restrict rwlock, const struct timespec *restrict
abs_timeout);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pthread_rwlock_timedwrlock() function
shall apply a write lock to the read-write lock referenced
by rwlock as in the pthread_rwlock_wrlock() function.
However, if the lock cannot be acquired without waiting for
other threads to unlock the lock, this wait shall be
terminated when the specified timeout expires. The time- out
shall expire when the absolute time specified by abs_timeout
passes, as measured by the clock on which timeouts are based
(that is, when the value of that clock equals or exceeds
abs_timeout), or if the absolute time specified by
abs_timeout has already been passed at the time of the
call.</p>

<p>If the Timers option is supported, the timeout shall be
based on the CLOCK_REALTIME clock. If the Timers option is
not supported, the time- out shall be based on the system
clock as returned by the time() func- tion. The resolution
of the timeout shall be the resolution of the clock on which
it is based. The timespec data type is defined in the
&lt;time.h&gt; header. Under no circumstances shall the
function fail with a timeout if the lock can be acquired
immediately. The validity of the abs_timeout parameter need
not be checked if the lock can be immedi- ately
acquired.</p>

<p>If a signal that causes a signal handler to be executed
is delivered to a thread blocked on a read-write lock via a
call to pthread_rwlock_timedwrlock(), upon return from the
signal handler the thread shall resume waiting for the lock
as if it was not interrupted.</p>

<p>The calling thread may deadlock if at the time the call
is made it holds the read-write lock. The results are
undefined if this function is called with an uninitialized
read-write lock.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The pthread_rwlock_timedwrlock() function
shall return zero if the lock for writing on the read-write
lock object referenced by rwlock is acquired. Otherwise, an
error number shall be returned to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The pthread_rwlock_timedwrlock() function shall
fail if:</p>

<p>ETIMEDOUT The lock could not be acquired before the
specified timeout expired.</p>

<p>The pthread_rwlock_timedwrlock() function may fail
if:</p>

<p>EDEADLK The calling thread already holds the rwlock.</p>

<p>EINVAL The value specified by rwlock does not refer to
an initialized read-write lock object, or the abs_timeout
nanosecond value is less than zero or greater than or equal
to 1000 million.</p>

<p>This function shall not return an error code of
[EINTR].</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE Applications using this function may
be subject to priority inversion, as discussed in the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 3.285,
Priority Inversion.</p>

<p>The pthread_rwlock_timedwrlock() function is part of the
Threads and Timeouts options and need not be provided on all
implementations.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
