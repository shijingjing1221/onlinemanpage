<p>XIGRABDEVICE(3) XIGRABDEVICE(3)</p>

<p>NAME XIGrabDevice, XIUngrabDevice - grab or ungrab the
device.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;X11/extensions/XInput2.h&gt;</p>

<p>Status XIGrabDevice( Display *display, int deviceid,
Window grab_window, Time time, Cursor cursor, int grab_mode,
int paired_device_mode, Bool owner_events, XIEventMask
*mask);</p>

<p>Status XIUngrabDevice( Display *display, int deviceid,
Time time);</p>

<p>cursor Specifies the cursor image to display for the
duration of the grab.</p>

<p>display Specifies the connection to the X server.</p>

<p>deviceid Specifies the device that should be grabbed or
ungrabbed.</p>

<p>grab_mode, paired_device_mode The grab mode for this
device and (if applicable) the paired device.</p>

<p>grab_window The grab window.</p>

<p>mask Event mask.</p>

<p>owner_events True if events are to be reported
normally.</p>

<p>time A valid timestamp or CurrentTime.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION XIGrabDevice actively grabs control of the
device. Further device events are reported only to the
grabbing client. XIGrabDevice overrides any active device
grab by this client.</p>

<p>If the device is an attached slave device, the device is
automatically detached from the master device and reattached
to the same master device when client ungrabs the device. If
the master device is removed while the device is floating as
a result of a grab, the device remains floating once the
grab deactivates.</p>

<p>If owner_events is False, all generated device events
are reported with respect to grab_window if selected. If
owner_events is True and if a generated device event would
normally be reported to this client, it is reported
normally; otherwise, the event is reported with respect to
the grab_window, and is only reported if specified in the
event mask.</p>

<p>If the grab_mode argument is XIGrabModeAsync, device
event processing continues as usual. If the device is
currently frozen by this client, then processing of device
events is resumed. If the grab_mode argument is
XIGrabModeSync, the state of the device (as seen by client
applications) appears to freeze, and the X server generates
no further device events until the grabbing client issues a
releasing XIAllowEvents call or until the device grab is
released. Actual device changes are not lost while the
device is frozen; they are simply queued in the server for
later processing.</p>

<p>If paired_device_mode is XIGrabModeAsync, processing of
events from the paired master device is unaffected by
activation of the grab. If paired_device_mode is
XIGrabModeSync, the state of the paired master device (as
seen by client applications) appears to freeze, and the X
server generates no further events from this device until
the grabbing client issues a releasing XIAllowEvents call or
until the device grab is released. Actual events are not
lost while the devices are frozen; they are simply queued in
the server for later processing. If the device is a slave
device paired_device_mode is ignored.</p>

<p>If the device is actively grabbed by some other client,
XIGrabDevice fails and returns AlreadyGrabbed. If
grab_window is not viewable, it fails and returns
GrabNotViewable. If the device is frozen by an active grab
of another client, it fails and returns GrabFrozen. If the
specified time is earlier than the last-device-grab time or
later than the current X server time, it fails and returns
GrabInvalidTime. Otherwise, the last-device-grab time is set
to the specified time. CurrentTime is replaced by the
current X server time.</p>

<p>If cursor is not None this cursor is displayed until the
client calls XIUngrabDevice.</p>

<p>XIGrabDevice can generate BadDevice, BadValue, and
BadWindow errors.</p>

<p>The XIUngrabDevice request releases the device and any
queued events if this client has it actively grabbed from
either XIGrabDevice or XIGrabKey or XIGrabButton. If other
devices are frozen by the grab, XUngrabDevice thaws them.
XUngrabDevice does not release the device and any queued
events if the specified time is earlier than the
last-device-grab time or is later than the current X server
time. The X server automatically performs an XIUngrabDevice
request if the event window for an active device grab
becomes not viewable.</p>

<p>XIUngrabDevice can generate a BadDevice error.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS BadValue A value is outside of the permitted
range.</p>

<p>BadDevice An invalid device was specified. The device
does not exist or is not a appropriate for the type of
change.</p>

<p>BadMatch The window is not viewable.</p>

<p>BadWindow A value for a Window argument does not name a
defined Window.</p>

<p>BUGS The protocol headers for XI 2.0 did not provide
XIGrabModeAsync or XIGrabModeSync. Use GrabModeSync and
GrabModeAsync instead, respectively.</p>
