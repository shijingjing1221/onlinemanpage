<p>HOSTS_OPTIONS(5) HOSTS_OPTIONS(5)</p>

<p>NAME hosts_options - host access control language
extensions</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This document describes optional extensions
to the language described in the hosts_access(5) document.
The extensions are enabled at program build time. For
example, by editing the Makefile and turning on the
PROCESS_OPTIONS compile-time option.</p>

<p>The extensible language uses the following format:</p>

<p>daemon_list : client_list : option : option ...</p>

<p>The first two fields are described in the
hosts_access(5) manual page. The remainder of the rules is a
list of zero or more options. Any &quot;:&quot; characters
within options should be protected with a backslash.</p>

<p>An option is of the form &quot;keyword&quot; or
&quot;keyword value&quot;. Options are pro- cessed in the
specified order. Some options are subjected to
%&lt;letter&gt; substitutions. For the sake of backwards
compatibility with earlier versions, an &quot;=&quot; is
permitted between keyword and value.</p>

<p>LOGGING severity mail.info</p>

<p>severity notice Change the severity level at which the
event will be logged. Facility names (such as mail) are
optional, and are not sup- ported on systems with older
syslog implementations. The sever- ity option can be used to
emphasize or to ignore specific events.</p>

<p>ACCESS CONTROL allow</p>

<p>deny Grant (deny) service. These options must appear at
the end of a rule.</p>

<p>The allow and deny keywords make it possible to keep all
access control rules within a single file, for example in
the hosts.allow file.</p>

<p>To permit access from specific hosts only:</p>

<p>ALL: .friendly.domain: ALLOW ALL: ALL: DENY</p>

<p>To permit access from all hosts except a few trouble
makers:</p>

<p>ALL: .bad.domain: DENY ALL: ALL: ALLOW</p>

<p>Notice the leading dot on the domain name patterns.</p>

<p>RUNNING OTHER COMMANDS spawn shell_command Execute, in a
child process, the specified shell command, after performing
the %&lt;letter&gt; expansions described in the
hosts_access(5) manual page. The command is executed with
stdin, stdout and stderr connected to the null device, so
that it won&acute;t mess up the conversation with the client
host. Example:</p>

<p>spawn (/some/where/safe_finger -l @%h | /usr/ucb/mail
root) &amp;</p>

<p>executes, in a background child process, the shell
command &quot;safe_finger -l @%h | mail root&quot; after
replacing %h by the name or address of the remote host.</p>

<p>The example uses the &quot;safe_finger&quot; command
instead of the regu- lar &quot;finger&quot; command, to
limit possible damage from data sent by the finger server.
The &quot;safe_finger&quot; command is part of the dae- mon
wrapper package; it is a wrapper around the regular finger
command that filters the data sent by the remote host.</p>

<p>twist shell_command Replace the current process by an
instance of the specified shell command, after performing
the %&lt;letter&gt; expansions described in the
hosts_access(5) manual page. Stdin, stdout and stderr are
connected to the client process. This option must appear at
the end of a rule.</p>

<p>To send a customized bounce message to the client
instead of running the real ftp daemon:</p>

<p>in.ftpd : ... : twist /bin/echo 421 Some bounce
message</p>

<p>For an alternative way to talk to client processes, see
the ban- ners option below.</p>

<p>To run /some/other/in.telnetd without polluting its
command-line array or its process environment:</p>

<p>in.telnetd : ... : twist PATH=/some/other; exec
in.telnetd</p>

<p>Warning: in case of UDP services, do not twist to
commands that use the standard I/O or the read(2)/write(2)
routines to commu- nicate with the client process; UDP
requires other I/O primi- tives.</p>

<p>NETWORK OPTIONS keepalive Causes the server to
periodically send a message to the client. The connection is
considered broken when the client does not respond. The
keepalive option can be useful when users turn off their
machine while it is still connected to a server. The
keepalive option is not useful for datagram (UDP)
services.</p>

<p>linger number_of_seconds Specifies how long the kernel
will try to deliver not-yet deliv- ered data after the
server process closes a connection.</p>

<p>USERNAME LOOKUP rfc931 [ timeout_in_seconds ] Look up
the client user name with the RFC 931 (TAP, IDENT, RFC 1413)
protocol. This option is silently ignored in case of ser-
vices based on transports other than TCP. It requires that
the client system runs an RFC 931 (IDENT, etc.) -compliant
daemon, and may cause noticeable delays with connections
from non-UNIX clients. The timeout period is optional. If no
timeout is spec- ified a compile-time defined default value
is taken.</p>

<p>MISCELLANEOUS banners /some/directory Look for a file in
/some/directory with the same name as the daemon process
(for example in.telnetd for the telnet service), and copy
its contents to the client. Newline characters are replaced
by carriage-return newline, and %&lt;letter&gt; sequences
are expanded (see the hosts_access(5) manual page).</p>

<p>The tcp wrappers source code distribution provides a
sample makefile (Banners.Makefile) for convenient banner
maintenance.</p>

<p>Warning: banners are supported for connection-oriented
(TCP) network services only.</p>

<p>nice [ number ] Change the nice value of the process
(default 10). Specify a positive value to spend more CPU
resources on other processes.</p>

<p>setenv name value Place a (name, value) pair into the
process environment. The value is subjected to
%&lt;letter&gt; expansions and may contain whitespace (but
leading and trailing blanks are stripped off).</p>

<p>Warning: many network daemons reset their environment
before spawning a login or shell process.</p>

<p>umask 022 Like the umask command that is built into the
shell. An umask of 022 prevents the creation of files with
group and world write permission. The umask argument should
be an octal number.</p>

<p>user nobody</p>

<p>user nobody.kmem Assume the privileges of the
&quot;nobody&quot; userid (or user &quot;nobody&quot;, group
&quot;kmem&quot;). The first form is useful with inetd
implementa- tions that run all services with root privilege.
The second form is useful for services that need special
group privileges only.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS When a syntax error is found in an access
control rule, the error is reported to the syslog daemon;
further options will be ignored, and service is denied.</p>

language</p>
