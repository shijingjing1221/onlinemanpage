<p>FFLUSH(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual FFLUSH(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME fflush - flush a stream</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</p>

<p>int fflush(FILE *stream);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION If stream points to an output stream or an
update stream in which the most recent operation was not
input, fflush() shall cause any unwritten data for that
stream to be written to the file, and the st_ctime and
st_mtime fields of the underlying file shall be marked for
update.</p>

<p>If stream is a null pointer, fflush() shall perform this
flushing action on all streams for which the behavior is
defined above.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, fflush() shall
return 0; otherwise, it shall set the error indicator for
the stream, return EOF, and set errno to indicate the
error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The fflush() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EAGAIN The O_NONBLOCK flag is set for the file
descriptor underlying stream and the process would be
delayed in the write operation.</p>

<p>EBADF The file descriptor underlying stream is not
valid.</p>

<p>EFBIG An attempt was made to write a file that exceeds
the maximum file size.</p>

<p>EFBIG An attempt was made to write a file that exceeds
the process file size limit.</p>

<p>EFBIG The file is a regular file and an attempt was made
to write at or beyond the offset maximum associated with the
corresponding stream.</p>

<p>EINTR The fflush() function was interrupted by a
signal.</p>

<p>EIO The process is a member of a background process
group attempting to write to its controlling terminal,
TOSTOP is set, the process is neither ignoring nor blocking
SIGTTOU, and the process group of the process is orphaned.
This error may also be returned under implementation-defined
conditions.</p>

<p>ENOSPC There was no free space remaining on the device
containing the file.</p>

<p>EPIPE An attempt is made to write to a pipe or FIFO that
is not open for reading by any process. A SIGPIPE signal
shall also be sent to the thread.</p>

<p>The fflush() function may fail if:</p>

<p>ENXIO A request was made of a nonexistent device, or the
request was outside the capabilities of the device.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Sending Prompts to Standard Output The
following example uses printf() calls to print a series of
prompts for information the user must enter from standard
input. The fflush() calls force the output to standard
output. The fflush() function is used because standard
output is usually buffered and the prompt may not
immediately be printed on the output or terminal. The gets()
calls read strings from standard input and place the results
in variables, for use later in the program.</p>

<p>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; ... char user[100]; char
oldpasswd[100]; char newpasswd[100]; ... printf(&quot;User
name: &quot;); fflush(stdout); gets(user);</p>

<p>printf(&quot;Old password: &quot;); fflush(stdout);
gets(oldpasswd);</p>

<p>printf(&quot;New password: &quot;); fflush(stdout);
gets(newpasswd); ...</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE Data buffered by the system may make
determining the validity of the position of the current file
descriptor impractical. Thus, enforcing the repositioning of
the file descriptor after fflush() on streams open for
read() is not mandated by IEEE Std 1003.1-2001.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
