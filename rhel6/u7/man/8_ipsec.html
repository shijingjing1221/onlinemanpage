<p>IPSEC(8) [FIXME: manual] IPSEC(8)</p>

<p>NAME ipsec - invoke IPsec utilities</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ipsec command [argument...] ipsec --help ipsec
--version ipsec --versioncode ipsec --copyright ipsec
--directory ipsec --confdir</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Ipsec invokes any of several utilities
involved in controlling the IPsec encryption/authentication
system, running the specified command with the specified
arguments as if it had been invoked directly. This largely
eliminates possible name collisions with other software, and
also permits some centralized services.</p>

<p>In particular, ipsec supplies the invoked command with a
suitable PATH environment variable, and also provides
IPSEC_DIR, IPSEC_CONFS, and IPSEC_VERSION environment
variables, containing respectively the full pathname of the
directory where the IPsec utilities are stored, the full
pathname of the directory where the configuration files
live, and the IPsec version number.</p>

<p>ipsec --help lists the available commands. Most have
their own manual pages, e.g. ipsec_auto(8) for auto.</p>

<p>ipsec --version outputs version information about Linux
FreeS/WAN. A version code of the form
Uxxx/Kyyy&acute;&acute; indicates that the user-level
utilities are version xxx but the kernel portion appears to
be version yyy (this form is used only if the two
disagree).</p>

<p>ipsec --versioncode outputs just the version code, with
none of --version&acute;s supporting information, for use by
scripts.</p>

<p>ipsec --copyright supplies boring copyright details.</p>

<p>ipsec --directory reports where ipsec thinks the IPsec
utilities are stored.</p>

<p>ipsec --confdir reports where ipsec thinks the IPsec
configuration files are stored.</p>

<p>FILES /usr/local/lib/ipsec usual utilities directory</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT The following environment variables control
where FreeS/WAN finds its components. The ipsec command sets
them if they are not already set.</p>

<p>IPSEC_EXECDIR directory containing published commands
IPSEC_LIBDIR directory containing internal executables
IPSEC_SBINDIR directory containing ipsec command IPSEC_CONFS
directory containing configuration files</p>

<p>SEE ALSO ipsec.conf(5), ipsec.secrets(5), ipsec_auto(8),
ipsec_barf(8), ipsec_setup(8), ipsec_showdefaults(8),
ipsec_showhostkey(8)</p>

<p>HISTORY Written for Linux FreeS/WAN
&lt;http://www.freeswan.org&gt; by Henry Spencer.</p>

<p>BUGS The provision of centralized services, while
convenient, does compromise the original concept of making
the utilities invocable directly as well as via ipsec.</p>
