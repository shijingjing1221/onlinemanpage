<p>NAME pmdasendmail - sendmail performance metrics domain
agent (PMDA)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/sendmail/pmdasendmail [-d
domain] [-l logfile] [-U user- name]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pmdasendmail is a sendmail Performance
Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which exports mail traffic
statistics as collected by sendmail(1).</p>

<p>Before the sendmail PMDA can export any metrics,
sendmail(1) must have statistics collection enabled. This
involves checking the name of the statistics file, as given
by the OS or O StatusFile control lines in /etc/sendmail.cf,
and then creating this file if it does not already exist.
Removing the file will terminate statistics collection by
send- mail(1) and hence the sendmail PMDA.</p>

<p>A brief description of the pmdasendmail command line
options follows:</p>

<p>-d It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics
domain num- ber specified here is unique and consistent.
That is, domain should be different for every PMDA on the
one host, and the same domain number should be used for the
same PMDA on all hosts.</p>

<p>-l Location of the log file. By default, a log file
named send- mail.log is written in the current directory of
pmcd(1) when pmdasendmail is started, i.e.
$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd. If the log file cannot be created or is
not writable, output is written to the standard error
instead.</p>

<p>-U User account under which to run the agent. The
default is the unprivileged &quot;pcp&quot; account in
current versions of PCP, but in older versions the superuser
account (&quot;root&quot;) was used by default.</p>

<p>There are no communication options, as the Install
script ensures the sendmail PMDA will be connected to PMCD
by a pipe.</p>

<p>INSTALLATION If you want access to the names, help text
and values for the sendmail performance metrics, do the
following as root:</p>

<p># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/sendmail # ./Install</p>

<p>If you want to undo the installation, do the following
as root:</p>

<p># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/sendmail # ./Remove</p>

<p>pmdasendmail is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be
executed directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify
pmcd(1) when the agent is installed or removed.</p>

<p>FILES $PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH command line options used to
launch pmdasendmail $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/sendmail/help default
help text file for the sendmail metrics
$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/sendmail/Install installation script for the
pmdasendmail agent $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/sendmail/Remove undo

$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/sendmail.log default log file for error
messages and other information from pmdasendmail
/etc/sendmail.cf sendmail configuration file to identify the
name of the statistics file</p>

<p>PCP ENVIRONMENT Environment variables with the prefix
PCP_ are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP. On each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in pcp.conf(5).</p>
