<p>NAME clusvcadm - Cluster User Service Administration
Utility</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS clusvcadm [-d &lt;service&gt; ] [-e
&lt;service&gt; [-F] ] [-l] [-u] [-S] [-m &lt;mem- ber&gt; ]
[-r &lt;service&gt; ] [-R &lt;service&gt; ] [-M
&lt;service&gt; ] [-Z &lt;service&gt; ] [-U &lt;service&gt;
] [-s &lt;service&gt; ] [-c &lt;service&gt; ] [-v]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The clusvcadm command allows an
administrator to enable, disable, relo- cate, and restart
user services in a cluster. In order to perform cluster
service operations, the cluster daemons must be running (and
have quorum) on the member system on which the command is
invoked.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -d &lt;service&gt; Stops and disables the user
service named service</p>

<p>-e &lt;service&gt; [-F] Enables and starts the user
service named service</p>

<p>Normally, rgmanager starts the service locally (i.e. on
the host where clusvcadm was run). However, if the -F option
is speci- fied, rgmanager will use the assigned failover
domain rules as hints on where to start the service.</p>

<p>-l Lock services in preparation for cluster shutdown.
This should only be used if the administrator intends to
perform a global, cluster wide shutdown. This prevents
services from starting (but not stopping, like -Z does).
Once the cluster quorum is dissolved, this state is reset.
If a new instance of rgmanager boots while others are
locked, the behavior is undefined.</p>

<p>-u Unlock resource group managers. This allows services
to start again.</p>

<p>-S Display whether the resource group managers are
locked or not. This can be used to verify the correct
operation of the -l and -u options, but is only useful for
debugging.</p>

<p>-m &lt;member&gt; When used in conjunction with either
the -e or -r options, this specifies the preferred target
member on which to start the ser- vice.</p>

<p>-r &lt;service&gt; Relocates the user service named
service to another cluster mem- ber.</p>

<p>-R &lt;service&gt; Restarts the user service named
service on the cluster member on which it is currently
running.</p>

<p>-M &lt;service&gt; Use a special &quot;migration&quot;
operation to move the user service named service to another
cluster member. Currently, this is only useful for virtual
machines. Use of migration usually requires special
configuration of the local virtual machine man- ager in
order to work correctly.</p>

<p>-Z &lt;service&gt; Freezes the service named service on
the cluster member on which it is currently running. This
will prevent status checks of the service as well as
failover in the event the node fails or rgmanager is
stopped.</p>

<p>-U &lt;service&gt; Unfreezes the user service named
service on the cluster member on which it is currently
running. This will re-enable status checks.</p>

<p>-s &lt;service&gt; Stops the service named service until
a member transition or until it is enabled again.</p>

<p>-c &lt;service&gt; Attempt to convalesce the named
service by restarting failed, non-critical components.</p>

<p>-v Display version information and exit.</p>

<p>NOTES Executing -U (unfreeze) on a service which was
frozen in the started state while the service owner is
offline results in an undefined (and possibly dangerous)
condition. Manually ensure all resources are clear before
doing this.</p>
