<p>FSTAB(5) Linux Programmer s Manual FSTAB(5)</p>

<p>NAME fstab - static information about the
filesystems</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;fstab.h&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The file fstab contains descriptive
information about the various file systems. fstab is only
read by programs, and not written; it is the duty of the
system administrator to properly create and maintain this
file. Each filesystem is described on a separate line;
fields on each line are separated by tabs or spaces. Lines
starting with # are com- ments. blank lines are ignored. The
order of records in fstab is important because fsck(8),
mount(8), and umount(8) sequentially iterate through fstab
doing their thing.</p>

<p>The first field, (fs_spec), describes the block special
device or remote filesystem to be mounted.</p>

<p>For ordinary mounts it will hold (a link to) a block
special device node (as created by mknod(8)) for the device
to be mounted, like /dev/cdrom or /dev/sdb7. For NFS mounts
one will have &lt;host&gt;:&lt;dir&gt;, e.g.,
knuth.aeb.nl:/. For procfs, use proc.</p>

<p>Instead of giving the device explicitly, one may
indicate the (ext2 or xfs) filesystem that is to be mounted
by its UUID or volume label (cf. e2label(8) or
xfs_admin(8)), writing LABEL=&lt;label&gt; or
UUID=&lt;uuid&gt;, e.g., LABEL=Boot or
UUID=3e6be9de-8139-11d1-9106-a43f08d823a6. This will make
the system more robust: adding or removing a SCSI disk
changes the disk device name but not the filesystem volume
label.</p>

<p>The second field, (fs_file), describes the mount point
for the filesys- tem. For swap partitions, this field should
be specified as none. If the name of the mount point
contains spaces these can be escaped as 40.</p>

<p>The third field, (fs_vfstype), describes the type of the
filesystem. Linux supports lots of filesystem types, such as
adfs, affs, autofs, coda, coherent, cramfs, devpts, efs,
ext2, ext3, hfs, hpfs, iso9660, jfs, minix, msdos, ncpfs,
nfs, ntfs, proc, qnx4, reiserfs, romfs, smbfs, sysv, tmpfs,
udf, ufs, umsdos, vfat, xenix, xfs, and possibly others. For
more details, see mount(8). For the filesystems currently
supported by the running kernel, see /proc/filesystems. An
entry swap denotes a file or partition to be used for
swapping, cf. swapon(8). An entry ignore causes the line to
be ignored. This is useful to show disk partitions which are
currently unused. An entry none is useful for bind or move
mounts.</p>

<p>mount(8) and umount(8) support filesystem subtypes. The
subtype is defined by .subtype suffix. For example
fuse.sshfs. It s recom- mended to use subtype notation
rather than add any prefix to the first fstab field (for
example sshfs#example.com is depreacated).</p>

<p>The fourth field, (fs_mntops), describes the mount
options associated with the filesystem.</p>

<p>It is formatted as a comma separated list of options. It
contains at least the type of mount plus any additional
options appropriate to the filesystem type. For
documentation on the available options for non- nfs file
systems, see mount(8). For documentation on all nfs-specific
options have a look at nfs(5). Common for all types of file
system are the options noauto (do not mount when &quot;mount
-a&quot; is given, e.g., at boot time), user (allow a user
to mount), and owner (allow device owner to mount), and
comment (e.g., for use by fstab-main- taining programs). The
owner and comment options are Linux- specific. For more
details, see mount(8).</p>

<p>The fifth field, (fs_freq), is used for these
filesystems by the dump(8) command to determine which
filesystems need to be dumped. If the fifth field is not
present, a value of zero is returned and dump will assume
that the filesystem does not need to be dumped.</p>

<p>The sixth field, (fs_passno), is used by the fsck(8)
program to deter- mine the order in which filesystem checks
are done at reboot time. The root filesystem should be
specified with a fs_passno of 1, and other filesystems
should have a fs_passno of 2. Filesystems within a drive
will be checked sequentially, but filesystems on different
drives will be checked at the same time to utilize
parallelism available in the hardware. If the sixth field is
not present or zero, a value of zero is returned and fsck
will assume that the filesystem does not need to be
checked.</p>

<p>The proper way to read records from fstab is to use the
routines getmn- tent(3).</p>

in 4.0BSD.</p>
