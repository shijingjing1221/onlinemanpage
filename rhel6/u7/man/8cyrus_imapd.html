<p>NAME imapd - IMAP server process</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS imapd [ -C config-file ] [ -U uses ] [ -T
timeout ] [ -D ] [ -s ] [ -N ] [ -p ssf ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Imapd is an IMAP4rev1 server. It accepts
commands on its standard input and responds on its standard
output. It MUST be invoked by mas- ter(8) with those
descriptors attached to a remote client connection.</p>

<p>Imapd reads its configuration options out of the
imapd.conf(5) file unless specified otherwise by -C.</p>

<p>If the file msg/shutdown is created under the directory
specified in the configdirectory configuration option, then
imapd will shut down the connection, sending the first line
contained in the file to the client as the reason. New
connections are denied.</p>

<p>If the file msg/motd is created under the directory
specified in the configdirectory configuration option, then
imapd will send the first line contained in the file to
clients upon connect as an ALERT message which
IMAP-compliant clients are required to display. This option
serves to annoy users mostly. Unfortunately clients tend to
connect far more frequently than is apparent, causing each
connection to gener- ate a seperate server ALERT for each
connection. Many clients do not display these properly, if
they do anything with them at all.</p>

<p>If the directory log/user exists under the directory
specified in the configdirectory configuration option, then
imapd will create protocol telemetry logs for sessions
authenticating as user. The telemetry logs will be stored in
the log/user directory with a filename of the imapd
process-id.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -C config-file Read configuration options from
config-file.</p>

<p>-U uses The maximum number of times that the process
should be used for new connections before shutting down. The
default is 250.</p>

<p>-T timeout The number of seconds that the process will
wait for a new con- nection before shutting down. Note that
a value of 0 (zero) will disable the timeout. The default is
60.</p>

<p>-D Run external debugger specified in debug_command.</p>

<p>-s Serve IMAP over SSL (imaps). All data to and from
imapd is encrypted using the Secure Sockets Layer.</p>

<p>-N Bypass password checking. (Not recommended unless you
know what youre doing.)</p>

<p>-p ssf Tell imapd that an external layer exists. An SSF
(security strength factor) of 1 means an integrity
protection layer exists. Any higher SSF implies some form of
privacy protection.</p>
