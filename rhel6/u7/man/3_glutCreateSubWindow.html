<p>NAME glutCreateSubWindow - Create a subwindow</p>

<p>LIBRARY OpenGLUT - window</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;openglut.h&gt;</p>

<p>int glutCreateSubWindow(int parentID, int x, int y, int
w, int h);</p>

<p>PARAMETERS parentID Parent window identifier</p>

<p>x Horizontal position of subwindow</p>

<p>y Vertical position of subwindow</p>

<p>w Width of subwindow</p>

<p>h Height of subwindow</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION In almost every regard that is important to
you, a subwindow is like a top-level window. It has a window
id; it has its own set of event call- backs; you can render
to it; you are notified of its creation; ...</p>

<p>A subwindow lives inside of some other window (possibly
a top-level win- dow, possibly another subwindow). Because
of this, it generally only interacts with other windows of
your own creation, hence it is not sub- jected to a window
manager. This is the primary source for its differ- ences
from a top-level window:</p>

<p>- There are no borders or decorations. - There is no
title bar, hence no title. - Requests tend to be acted on a
little more directly, without interfer- ence from a window
manager. - The subwindow inherits the display mode of its
parent.</p>

<p>Like a top-level window, you must register a display
callback function if you wish to use glutMainloop().</p>

<p>A notable case where this function can fail is for
offscreen windows. A coherent concept of a subwindow of an
offscreen window would introduce more complication than is
presently believed to be worthwhile. Attempt- ing such a
window presently just fails. Failure is denoted by a 0 win-
dow id being returned.</p>

<p>Subwindows can be very useful for partitioning a window
into GUI ele- ments: They have their own input callbacks, so
you dont have to figure out which window an event is for.
Graphics are clipped to the boundaries of your subwindows,
so you do not need to worry much about where your drawing
goes. Because windows and subwindows work almost identically
from the perspective of a GLUT program, it is relatively
easy to move a cluster of related controls into a separate
top-level window---or, con- versely, embed what was a
top-level window inside of another window. OpenGLUT can also
report some basic statistics about your (sub)window,
relieving you of the duty of tracking all of that
information for your- self.</p>
