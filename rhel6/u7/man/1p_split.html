<p>SPLIT(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual SPLIT(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME split - split files into pieces</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS split [-l line_count][-a
suffix_length][file[name]]</p>

<p>split -b n[k|m][-a suffix_length][file[name]]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The split utility shall read an input file
and write one or more output files. The default size of each
output file shall be 1000 lines. The size of the output
files can be modified by specification of the -b or -l
options. Each output file shall be created with a unique
suffix. The suffix shall consist of exactly suffix_length
lowercase letters from the POSIX locale. The letters of the
suffix shall be used as if they were a base-26 digit system,
with the first suffix to be created con- sisting of
allacharacters, the second with abreplacing the last a , and
so on, until a name of all z characters is created. By
default, the names of the output files shall be, followed by
a two- character suffix from the character set as described
above, starting with &quot;aa&quot;, &quot;ab&quot;,
&quot;ac&quot;, and so on, and continuing until the suffix
&quot;zz&quot;, for a maximum of 676 files.</p>

<p>If the number of files required exceeds the maximum
allowed by the suf- fix length provided, such that the last
allowable file would be larger than the requested size, the
split utility shall fail after creating the last file with a
valid suffix; split shall not delete the files it created
with valid suffixes. If the file limit is not exceeded, the
last file created shall contain the remainder of the input
file, and may be smaller than the requested size.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The split utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>The following options shall be supported:</p>

<p>-a suffix_length</p>

<p>Use suffix_length letters to form the suffix portion of
the filenames of the split file. If -a is not specified, the
default suffix length shall be two. If the sum of the name
operand and the suffix_length option-argument would create a
filename exceeding {NAME_MAX} bytes, an error shall result;
split shall exit with a diagnostic message and no files
shall be created.</p>

<p>-b n Split a file into pieces n bytes in size.</p>

<p>-b nk Split a file into pieces n*1024 bytes in size.</p>

<p>-b nm Split a file into pieces n*1048576 bytes in
size.</p>

<p>-l line_count Specify the number of lines in each
resulting file piece. The line_count argument is an unsigned
decimal integer. The default is 1000. If the input does not
end with a &lt;newline&gt;, the partial line shall be
included in the last output file.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operands shall be supported:</p>

<p>file The pathname of the ordinary file to be split. If
no input file is given or file is, the standard input shall
be used.</p>

<p>name The prefix to be used for each of the files
resulting from the split operation. If no name argument is
given,x shall be used as the prefix of the output files. The
combined length of the basename of prefix and suffix_length
cannot exceed {NAME_MAX} bytes. See the OPTIONS section.</p>

<p>STDIN See the INPUT FILES section.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES Any file can be used as input.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of split:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments
and input files).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT Not used.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES The output files contain portions of the
original input file; other- wise, unchanged.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 Successful completion.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES In the following examples foo is a text file
that contains 5000 lines.</p>

<p>1. Create five files, xaa, xab, xac, xad, and xae:</p>

<p>split foo</p>

<p>2. Create five files, but the suffixed portion of the
created files consists of three letters, xaaa, xaab, xaac,
xaad, and xaae:</p>

<p>split -a 3 foo</p>

<p>3. Create three files with four-letter suffixes and a
supplied prefix, bar_aaaa, bar_aaab, and bar_aaac:</p>

<p>split -a 4 -l 2000 foo bar_</p>

<p>4. Create as many files as are necessary to contain at
most 20*1024 bytes, each with the default prefix of x and a
five-letter suffix:</p>

<p>split -a 5 -b 20k foo</p>

<p>RATIONALE The -b option was added to provide a mechanism
for splitting files other than by lines. While most uses of
the -b option are for transmit- ting files over networks,
some believed it would have additional uses.</p>

<p>The -a option was added to overcome the limitation of
being able to create only 676 files.</p>

<p>Consideration was given to deleting this utility, using
the rationale that the functionality provided by this
utility is available via the csplit utility (see csplit ).
Upon reconsideration of the purpose of the User Portability
Extension, it was decided to retain both this utility and
the csplit utility because users use both utilities and have
historical expectations of their behavior. Furthermore, the
split- ting on byte boundaries in split cannot be duplicated
with the histori- cal csplit.</p>

<p>The text &quot; split shall not delete the files it
created with valid suf- fixes&quot; would normally be
assumed, but since the related utility, csplit, does delete
files under some circumstances, the historical behavior of
split is made explicit to avoid misinterpretation.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
