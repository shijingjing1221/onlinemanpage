<p>SCHED_SETAFFINITY(2) Linux Programmer s Manual
SCHED_SETAFFINITY(2)</p>

<p>NAME sched_setaffinity, sched_getaffinity - set and get
a processs CPU affinity mask</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #define _GNU_SOURCE #include
&lt;sched.h&gt;</p>

<p>int sched_setaffinity(pid_t pid, size_t cpusetsize,
cpu_set_t *mask);</p>

<p>int sched_getaffinity(pid_t pid, size_t cpusetsize,
cpu_set_t *mask);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION A processs CPU affinity mask determines the
set of CPUs on which it is eligible to run. On a
multiprocessor system, setting the CPU affinity mask can be
used to obtain performance benefits. For example, by dedi-
cating one CPU to a particular process (i.e., setting the
affinity mask of that process to specify a single CPU, and
setting the affinity mask of all other processes to exclude
that CPU), it is possible to ensure maximum execution speed
for that process. Restricting a process to run on a single
CPU also avoids the performance cost caused by the cache
invalidation that occurs when a process ceases to execute on
one CPU and then recommences execution on a different
CPU.</p>

<p>A CPU affinity mask is represented by the cpu_set_t
structure, a &quot;CPU set&quot;, pointed to by mask. A set
of macros for manipulating CPU sets is described in
CPU_SET(3).</p>

<p>sched_setaffinity() sets the CPU affinity mask of the
process whose ID is pid to the value specified by mask. If
pid is zero, then the call- ing process is used. The
argument cpusetsize is the length (in bytes) of the data
pointed to by mask. Normally this argument would be speci-
fied as sizeof(cpu_set_t).</p>

<p>If the process specified by pid is not currently running
on one of the CPUs specified in mask, then that process is
migrated to one of the CPUs specified in mask.</p>

<p>sched_getaffinity() writes the affinity mask of the
process whose ID is pid into the cpu_set_t structure pointed
to by mask. The cpusetsize argument specifies the size (in
bytes) of mask. If pid is zero, then the mask of the calling
process is returned.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, sched_setaffinity() and
sched_getaffinity() return 0. On error, -1 is returned, and
errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS EFAULT A supplied memory address was invalid.</p>

<p>EINVAL The affinity bit mask mask contains no processors
that are cur- rently physically on the system and permitted
to the process according to any restrictions that may be
imposed by the &quot;cpuset&quot; mechanism described in
cpuset(7).</p>

<p>EINVAL (sched_getaffinity() and, in kernels before
2.6.9, sched_setaffinity()) cpusetsize is smaller than the
size of the affinity mask used by the kernel.</p>

<p>EPERM (sched_setaffinity()) The calling process does not
have appro- priate privileges. The caller needs an effective
user ID equal to the user ID or effective user ID of the
process identified by pid, or it must possess the
CAP_SYS_NICE capability.</p>

<p>ESRCH The process whose ID is pid could not be
found.</p>

<p>VERSIONS The CPU affinity system calls were introduced
in Linux kernel 2.5.8. The system call wrappers were
introduced in glibc 2.3. Initially, the glibc interfaces
included a cpusetsize argument, typed as unsigned int. In
glibc 2.3.3, the cpusetsize argument was removed, but was
then restored in glibc 2.3.4, with type size_t.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO These system calls are Linux-specific.</p>

<p>NOTES After a call to sched_setaffinity(), the set of
CPUs on which the pro- cess will actually run is the
intersection of the set specified in the mask argument and
the set of CPUs actually present on the system. The system
may further restrict the set of CPUs on which the process
runs if the &quot;cpuset&quot; mechanism described in
cpuset(7) is being used. These restrictions on the actual
set of CPUs on which the process will run are silently
imposed by the kernel.</p>

<p>sched_setscheduler(2) has a description of the Linux
scheduling scheme.</p>

<p>The affinity mask is actually a per-thread attribute
that can be adjusted independently for each of the threads
in a thread group. The value returned from a call to
gettid(2) can be passed in the argument pid. Specifying pid
as 0 will set the attribute for the calling thread, and
passing the value returned from a call to getpid(2) will set
the attribute for the main thread of the thread group. (If
you are using the POSIX threads API, then use
pthread_setaffinity_np (3) instead of
sched_setaffinity().)</p>

<p>A child created via fork(2) inherits its parents CPU
affinity mask. The affinity mask is preserved across an
execve(2).</p>

<p>This manual page describes the glibc interface for the
CPU affinity calls. The actual system call interface is
slightly different, with the mask being typed as unsigned
long *, reflecting the fact that the underlying
implementation of CPU sets is a simple bit mask. On suc-
cess, the raw sched_getaffinity() system call returns the
size (in bytes) of the cpumask_t data type that is used
internally by the kernel to represent the CPU set bit
mask.</p>
