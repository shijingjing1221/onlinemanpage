<p>NAME tpm_changeownerauth - change the authorization data
associated with the owner or SRK</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS tpm_changeownerauth [OPTION]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION tpm_changeownerauth allows for changing the

prompts for current password, followed by the new password
and a confirmation of the new password. The --owner option
changes the TPM owner password and --srk option changes the
TPMs SRK password. The --well-known option is used when SRK
or owner passwords need to be changed and current owner
password is a secret of zeros, --set-well-known option
changes current password to a secret of zeros, both options
do not work by themselves, they must be used with --owner
and --srk options to indicate which of these passwords will
be changed.</p>
