<p>NAME TIFFReadRawTile - return an undecoded tile of data
from an open TIFF file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tiffio.h&gt;</p>

<p>tsize_t TIFFReadRawTile(TIFF *tif, ttile_t tile, tdata_t
buf, tsize_t size)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Read the contents of the specified tile into
the (user supplied) data buffer. Note that the value of tile
is a raw tile number. That is, the caller must take into
account whether or not the data is organized in separate
planes (PlanarConfiguration=2). TIFFComputeTile automati-
cally does this when converting an (x,y,z,sample) coordinate
quadruple to a tile number. To read a full tile of data the
data buffer should typically be at least as large as the
value returned by TIFFTileSize.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUES The actual number of bytes of data that
were placed in buf is returned; TIFFReadEncodedTile returns
-1 if an error was encountered.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS All error messages are directed to the
TIFFError(3TIFF) routine.</p>
