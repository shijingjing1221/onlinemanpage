<p>NAME slapo-pcache - proxy cache overlay to slapd</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS /etc/openldap/slapd.conf</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pcache overlay to slapd(8) allows
caching of LDAP search requests (queries) in a local
database. For an incoming query, the proxy cache determines
its corresponding template. If the template was specified as
cacheable using the pcacheTemplate directive and the request
is con- tained in a cached request, it is answered from the
proxy cache. Oth- erwise, the search is performed as usual
and cacheable search results are saved in the cache for use
in future queries.</p>

<p>A template is defined by a filter string and an index
identifying a set of attributes. The template string for a
query can be obtained by removing assertion values from the
RFC 4515 representation of its search filter. A query
belongs to a template if its template string and set of
projected attributes correspond to a cacheable template.
Exam- ples of template strings are (mail=), (|(sn=)(cn=)),
(&amp;(sn=)(given- Name=)).</p>

<p>The config directives that are specific to the pcache
overlay can be prefixed by pcache-, to avoid conflicts with
directives specific to the underlying database or to other
stacked overlays. This may be particu- larly useful for
those directives that refer to the backend used for local
storage. The following cache specific directives can be used
to configure the proxy cache:</p>

<p>overlay pcache This directive adds the proxy cache
overlay to the current back- end. The proxy cache overlay
may be used with any backend but is intended for use with
the ldap, meta, and sql backends. Please note that the
underlying backend must have a configured rootdn.</p>

<p>pcache &lt;database&gt; &lt;max_entries&gt;
&lt;numattrsets&gt; &lt;entry_limit&gt; &lt;cc_period&gt;
The directive enables proxy caching in the current backend
and sets general cache parameters. A &lt;database&gt;
backend will be used internally to maintain the cached
entries. The chosen database will need to be configured as
well, as shown below. Cache replacement is invoked when the
cache size grows to &lt;max_entries&gt; entries and
continues till the cache size drops below this size.
&lt;numattrsets&gt; should be equal to the number of
following pcacheAttrset directives. Queries are cached only
if they correspond to a cacheable template (specified by the
pca- cheTemplate directive) and the number of entries
returned is less than &lt;entry_limit&gt;. Consistency check
is performed every &lt;cc_period&gt; duration (specified in
secs). In each cycle queries with expired &quot;time to
live(TTL)&quot; are removed. A sample cache configuration
is:</p>

<p>pcache bdb 10000 1 50 100</p>

<p>pcacheAttrset &lt;index&gt; &lt;attrs...&gt; Used to
associate a set of attributes &lt;attrs..&gt; with an
&lt;index&gt;. Each attribute set is associated with an
integer from 0 to &lt;numattrsets&gt;-1. These indices are
used by the pcacheTemplate directive to define cacheable
templates. A set of attributes cannot be empty. A set of
attributes can contain the special attributes &quot;*&quot;
(all user attributes), &quot;+&quot; (all operational
attributes) or both; in the latter case, any other attribute
is redundant and should be avoided for clarity. A set of
attributes can contain &quot;1.1&quot; as the only
attribute; in this case, only the presence of the entries is
cached. Attributes prefixed by &quot;undef:&quot; need not
be present in the schema.</p>

<p>pcacheMaxQueries &lt;queries&gt; Specify the maximum
number of queries to cache. The default is 10000.</p>

<p>pcacheValidate { TRUE | FALSE } Check whether the
results of a query being cached can actually be returned
from the cache by the proxy DSA. When enabled, the entries
being returned while caching the results of a query are
checked to ensure consistency with the schema known to the
proxy DSA. In case of failure, the query is not cached. By
default, the check is off.</p>

<p>pcacheOffline { TRUE | FALSE } Set the cache to offline
mode. While offline, the consistency checker will be stopped
and no expirations will occur. This allows the cache
contents to be used indefinitely while the proxy is cut off
from network access to the remote DSA. The default is FALSE,
i.e. consistency checks and expirations will be
performed.</p>

<p>pcachePersist { TRUE | FALSE } Specify whether the
cached queries should be saved across restarts of the
caching proxy, to provide hot startup of the cache. Only
non-expired queries are reloaded. The default is FALSE.</p>

<p>CAVEAT: of course, the configuration of the proxy cache
must not change across restarts; the pcache overlay does not
perform any consistency checks in this sense. In detail,
this option should be disabled unless the existing
pcacheAttrset and pcacheTemplate directives are not changed
neither in order nor in contents. If new sets and templates
are added, or if other details of the pcache overlay
configuration changed, this feature should not be
affected.</p>

<p>pcacheTemplate &lt;template_string&gt;
&lt;attrset_index&gt; &lt;ttl&gt; [&lt;negttl&gt;
[&lt;limitttl&gt; [&lt;ttr&gt;]]] Specifies a cacheable
template and &quot;time to live&quot; &lt;ttl&gt; of queries
belonging to the template. An optional &lt;negttl&gt; can be
used to specify that negative results (i.e., queries that
returned zero entries) should also be cached for the
specified amount of time. Negative results are not cached by
default (&lt;negttl&gt; set to 0). An optional
&lt;limitttl&gt; can be used to specify that results hitting
a sizelimit should also be cached for the specified amount
of time. Results hitting a sizelimit are not cached by
default (&lt;limitttl&gt; set to 0). An optional &lt;ttr&gt;
&quot;time to refresh&quot; can be used to specify that
cached entries should be automatically refreshed after a
certain time. Entries will only be refreshed while they have
not expired, so the &lt;ttl&gt; should be larger than the
&lt;ttr&gt; for this option to be useful. Entries are not
refreshed by default (&lt;ttr&gt; set to 0).</p>

<p>pcacheBind &lt;filter_template&gt; &lt;attrset_index&gt;
&lt;ttr&gt; &lt;scope&gt; &lt;base&gt; Specifies a template
for caching Simple Bind credentials based on an already
defined pcacheTemplate. The &lt;filter_template&gt; is
similar to a &lt;template_string&gt; except that it may have
some val- ues present. Its purpose is to allow the overlay
to generate filters similar to what other applications do
when they do a Search immediately before a Bind. E.g., if a
client like nss_ldap is configured to search for a user with
the filter
&quot;(&amp;(objectClass=posixAccount)(uid=&lt;username&gt;))&quot;
then the corre- sponding template
&quot;(&amp;(objectClass=posixAccount)(uid=))&quot; should
be used here. When converted to a regular template e.g.
&quot;(&amp;(objectClass=)(uid=))&quot; this template and
the &lt;attrset_index&gt; must match an already defined
pcacheTemplate clause. The &quot;time to refresh&quot;
&lt;ttr&gt; determines the time interval after which the
cached credentials may be refreshed. The first Bind request
that occurs after that time will trigger the refresh
attempt. Refreshes are not performed when the overlay is
Offline. There is no &quot;time to live&quot; parameter for
the Bind credentials; the credentials will expire according
to the pcacheTemplate ttl. The &lt;scope&gt; and
&lt;base&gt; should match the search scope and base used by
the authentication clients. The cached credentials are not
stored in cleartext, they are hashed using the default
password hash. By default Bind caching is not enabled.</p>

<p>pcachePosition { head | tail } Specifies whether the
response callback should be placed at the tail (the default)
or at the head (actually, wherever the stack- ing sequence
would make it appear) of the callback list. This affects how
the overlay interacts with other overlays, since the
proxycache overlay should be executed as early as possible
(and thus configured as late as possible), to get a chance
to return the cached results; however, if executed early at
response, it would cache entries that may be later
&quot;massaged&quot; by other databases and thus returned
after massaging the first time, and before massaging when
cached.</p>

<p>There are some constraints:</p>

<p>all values must be positive;</p>

<p>&lt;entry_limit&gt; must be less than or equal to
&lt;max_entries&gt;;</p>

<p>&lt;numattrsets&gt; attribute sets SHOULD be defined by
using the directive pcacheAttrset;</p>

<p>all attribute sets SHOULD be referenced by (at least)
one pca- cheTemplate directive;</p>

<p>The following adds a template with filter string
(&amp;(sn=)(givenName=)) and attributes mail, postaladdress,
telephonenumber and a TTL of 1 hour.</p>

<p>pcacheAttrset 0 mail postaladdress telephonenumber
pcacheTemplate (&amp;(sn=)(givenName=)) 0 3600</p>

<p>Directives for configuring the underlying database must
also be given, as shown here:</p>

<p>directory /var/tmp/cache cachesize 100</p>

<p>Any valid directives for the chosen database type may be
used. Indexing should be used as appropriate for the queries
being handled. In addi- tion, an equality index on the
pcacheQueryid attribute should be con- figured, to assist in
the removal of expired query data.</p>

<p>BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY The configuration keywords have
been renamed and the older form is dep- recated. These older
keywords are still recognized but may disappear in future
releases.</p>

<p>proxycache use pcache</p>

<p>proxyattrset use pcacheAttrset</p>

<p>proxycachequeries use pcacheMaxQueries</p>

<p>proxycheckcacheability use pcacheValidate</p>

<p>proxysavequeries use pcachePersist</p>

<p>proxytemplate use pcacheTemplate</p>

<p>response-callback use pcachePosition</p>

<p>CAVEATS Caching data is prone to inconsistencies because
updates on the remote server will not be reflected in the
response of the cache at least (and at most) for the
duration of the pcacheTemplate TTL. These inconsis- tencies
can be minimized by careful use of the TTR.</p>

<p>The remote server should expose the objectClass
attribute because the underlying database that actually
caches the entries may need it for optimal local processing
of the queries.</p>

<p>The proxy server should contain all the schema
information required for caching. Significantly, it needs
the schema of attributes used in the query templates. If the
objectClass attribute is used in a query tem- plate, it
needs the definition of the objectClasses of the entries it
is supposed to cache. It is the responsibility of the proxy
adminis- trator to keep the proxy schema lined up with that
of the proxied server.</p>

<p>Another potential (and subtle) inconsistency may occur
when data is retrieved with different identities and
specific per-identity access control is enforced by the
remote server. If data was retrieved with an identity that
collected only partial results because of access rules
enforcement on the remote server, other users with different
access privileges on the remote server will get different
results from the remote server and from the cache. If those
users have higher access privileges on the remote server,
they will get from the cache only a subset of the results
they would get directly from the remote server; but if they
have lower access privileges, they will get from the cache a
superset of the results they would get directly from the
remote server. Either occurrence may or may not be
acceptable, based on the security policy of the cache and of
the remote server. It is important to note that in this case
the proxy is violating the security of the remote server by
disclosing to an identity data that was collected by another
identity. For this reason, it is suggested that, when using
back-ldap, proxy caching be used in conjunction with the
identity assertion feature of slapd-ldap(5) (see the
idassert-bind and the idassert-authz statements), so that
remote server interrogation occurs with a vanilla identity
that has some relatively high search and read access
privileges, and the &quot;real&quot; access control is
delegated to the proxys ACLs. Beware that since only the
cached fraction of the real datum is available to the cache,
it may not be possible to enforce the same access rules that
are defined on the remote server. When security is a
concern, cached proxy access must be carefully tailored.</p>
