<p>NAME ptmx and pts - pseudo-terminal master and slave</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The file /dev/ptmx is a character file with
major number 5 and minor number 2, usually of mode 0666 and
owner.group of root.root. It is used to create a
pseudo-terminal master and slave pair.</p>

<p>When a process opens /dev/ptmx, it gets a file
descriptor for a pseudo- terminal master (PTM), and a
pseudo-terminal slave (PTS) device is cre- ated in the
/dev/pts directory. Each file descriptor obtained by open-
ing /dev/ptmx is an independent PTM with its own associated
PTS, whose path can be found by passing the descriptor to
ptsname(3).</p>

<p>Before opening the pseudo-terminal slave, you must pass
the masters file descriptor to grantpt(3) and
unlockpt(3).</p>

<p>Once both the pseudo-terminal master and slave are open,
the slave pro- vides processes with an interface that is
identical to that of a real terminal.</p>

<p>Data written to the slave is presented on the master
descriptor as input. Data written to the master is presented
to the slave as input.</p>

<p>In practice, pseudo-terminals are used for implementing
terminal emula- tors such as xterm(1), in which data read
from the pseudo-terminal mas- ter is interpreted by the
application in the same way a real terminal would interpret
the data, and for implementing remote-login programs such as
sshd(8), in which data read from the pseudo-terminal master
is sent across the network to a client program that is
connected to a ter- minal or terminal emulator.</p>

<p>Pseudo-terminals can also be used to send input to
programs that nor- mally refuse to read input from pipes
(such as su(1), and passwd(1)).</p>

<p>FILES /dev/ptmx, /dev/pts/*</p>

<p>NOTES The Linux support for the above (known as Unix98
pty naming) is done using the devpts file system, that
should be mounted on /dev/pts.</p>

<p>Before this Unix98 scheme, master ptys were called
/dev/ptyp0, ... and slave ptys /dev/ttyp0, ... and one
needed lots of preallocated device nodes.</p>
