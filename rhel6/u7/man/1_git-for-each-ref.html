<p>GIT-FOR-EACH-REF(1) Git Manual GIT-FOR-EACH-REF(1)</p>

<p>NAME git-for-each-ref - Output information on each
ref</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS git for-each-ref [--count=&lt;count&gt;]
[--shell|--perl|--python|--tcl]
[--sort=&lt;key&gt;][--format=&lt;format&gt;]
[&lt;pattern&gt;...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Iterate over all refs that match
&lt;pattern&gt; and show them according to the given
&lt;format&gt;, after sorting them according to the given
set of &lt;key&gt;. If &lt;count&gt; is given, stop after
showing that many refs. The interpolated values in
&lt;format&gt; can optionally be quoted as string literals
in the specified host language allowing their direct
evaluation in that language.</p>

<p>OPTIONS &lt;count&gt; By default the command shows all
refs that match &lt;pattern&gt;. This option makes it stop
after showing that many refs.</p>

<p>&lt;key&gt; A field name to sort on. Prefix - to sort in
descending order of the value. When unspecified, refname is
used. You may use the --sort=&lt;key&gt; option multiple
times, in which case the last key becomes the primary
key.</p>

<p>&lt;format&gt; A string that interpolates %(fieldname)
from the object pointed at by a ref being shown. If
fieldname is prefixed with an asterisk (*) and the ref
points at a tag object, the value for the field in the
object tag refers is used. When unspecified, defaults to
%(objectname) SPC %(objecttype) TAB %(refname). It also
interpolates %% to %, and %xx where xx are hex digits
interpolates to character with hex code xx; for example %00
interpolates to (NUL), %09 to (TAB) and %0a to (LF).</p>

<p>&lt;pattern&gt;... If one or more patterns are given,
only refs are shown that match against at least one pattern,
either using fnmatch(3) or literally, in the latter case
matching completely or from the beginning up to a slash.</p>

<p>--shell, --perl, --python, --tcl If given, strings that
substitute %(fieldname) placeholders are quoted as string
literals suitable for the specified host language. This is
meant to produce a scriptlet that can directly be
evaled.</p>

<p>FIELD NAMES Various values from structured fields in
referenced objects can be used to interpolate into the
resulting output, or as sort keys.</p>

<p>For all objects, the following names can be used:</p>

<p>refname The name of the ref (the part after $GIT_DIR/).
For a non-ambiguous short name of the ref append :short. The
option core.warnAmbiguousRefs is used to select the strict
abbreviation mode.</p>

<p>objecttype The type of the object (blob, tree, commit,
tag).</p>

<p>objectsize The size of the object (the same as git
cat-file -s reports).</p>

<p>objectname The object name (aka SHA-1).</p>

<p>upstream The name of a local ref which can be considered
upstream from the displayed ref. Respects :short in the same
way as refname above.</p>

<p>In addition to the above, for commit and tag objects,
the header field names (tree, parent, object, type, and tag)
can be used to specify the value in the header field.</p>

<p>Fields that have name-email-date tuple as its value
(author, committer, and tagger) can be suffixed with name,
email, and date to extract the named component.</p>

<p>The first line of the message in a commit and tag object
is subject, the remaining lines are body. The whole message
is contents.</p>

<p>For sorting purposes, fields with numeric values sort in
numeric order (objectsize, authordate, committerdate,
taggerdate). All other fields are used to sort in their
byte-value order.</p>

<p>In any case, a field name that refers to a field
inapplicable to the object referred by the ref does not
cause an error. It returns an empty string instead.</p>

<p>As a special case for the date-type fields, you may
specify a format for the date by adding one of :default,
:relative, :short, :local, :iso8601 or :rfc2822 to the end
of the fieldname; e.g. %(taggerdate:relative).</p>

<p>EXAMPLES An example directly producing formatted text.
Show the most recent 3 tagged commits::</p>

<p>#!/bin/sh</p>

<p>git for-each-ref --count=3
--sort=&acute;-*authordate&acute; --format=&acute;From:
%(*authorname) %(*authoremail) Subject: %(*subject) Date:
%(*authordate) Ref: %(*refname)</p>

<p>%(*body) &acute; &acute;refs/tags&acute;</p>

<p>A simple example showing the use of shell eval on the
output, demonstrating the use of --shell. List the prefixes
of all heads::</p>

<p>#!/bin/sh</p>

<p>git for-each-ref --shell
--format=&quot;ref=%(refname)&quot; refs/heads | while read
entry do eval &quot;$entry&quot; echo dirname $ref done</p>

<p>A bit more elaborate report on tags, demonstrating that
the format may be an entire script::</p>

<p>#!/bin/sh</p>

<p>fmt=&acute; r=%(refname) t=%(*objecttype)
T=${r#refs/tags/}</p>

<p>o=%(*objectname) n=%(*authorname) e=%(*authoremail)
s=%(*subject) d=%(*authordate) b=%(*body)</p>

<p>kind=Tag if test &quot;z$t&quot; = z then # could be a
lightweight tag t=%(objecttype) kind=&quot;Lightweight
tag&quot; o=%(objectname) n=%(authorname) e=%(authoremail)
s=%(subject) d=%(authordate) b=%(body) fi echo &quot;$kind
$T points at a $t object $o&quot; if test &quot;z$t&quot; =
zcommit then echo &quot;The commit was authored by $n $e at
$d, and titled</p>

<p>$s</p>

<p>Its message reads as: &quot; echo &quot;$b&quot; | sed
-e &quot;s/^/ /&quot; echo fi &acute;</p>

<p>eval= git for-each-ref --shell --format=&quot;$fmt&quot;
--sort=&acute;*objecttype&acute; --sort=-taggerdate
refs/tags eval &quot;$eval&quot;</p>
