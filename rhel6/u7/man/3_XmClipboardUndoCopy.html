<p>NAME XmClipboardUndoCopy A clipboard function that
deletes the last item placed on the clipboard</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;Xm/CutPaste.h&gt; int
XmClipboardUndoCopy (display, window) Display * display;
Window window; (void)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION XmClipboardUndoCopy deletes the last item
placed on the clipboard if the item was placed there by an
application with the passed display and window arguments.
Any data item deleted from the clipboard by the orig- inal
call to XmClipboardCopy is restored. If the display or
window IDs do not match the last copied item, no action is
taken, and this func- tion has no effect.</p>

<p>display Specifies a pointer to the Display structure
that was returned in a previous call to XOpenDisplay or
XtDisplay.</p>

<p>window Specifies the window ID of a widget that relates
the applica- tion window to the clipboard. The widgets
window ID can be obtained through XtWindow. The same
application instance should pass the same window ID to each
clipboard function it calls.</p>

<p>RETURN XmClipboardSuccess The function was
successful.</p>

<p>XmClipboardLocked The function failed because the
clipboard was locked by another application. The application
can continue to call the function again with the same
parameters until the lock goes away. This gives the
application the opportunity to ask if the user wants to keep
trying or to give up on the operation.</p>
