<p>XtRealizeWidget(3) XT FUNCTIONS XtRealizeWidget(3)</p>

<p>NAME XtRealizeWidget, XtIsRealized, XtUnrealizeWidget -
realize and unreal- ize widgets</p>

<p>SYNTAX void XtRealizeWidget(Widget w);</p>

<p>Boolean XtIsRealized(Widget w);</p>

<p>void XtUnrealizeWidget(Widget w);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS w Specifies the widget.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION If the widget is already realized,
XtRealizeWidget simply returns. Otherwise, it performs the
following:</p>

<p>&middot; Binds all action names in the widget s
translation table to proce- dures (see Section 10.1.2).</p>

<p>&middot; Makes a post-order traversal of the widget tree
rooted at the specified widget and calls the change_managed
procedure of each composite widget that has one or more
managed children.</p>

<p>&middot; Constructs an XSetWindowAttributes structure
filled in with infor- mation derived from the Core widget
fields and calls the realize procedure for the widget, which
adds any widget-specific attributes and creates the X
window.</p>

<p>&middot; If the widget is not a subclass of
compositeWidgetClass, XtRealizeWidget returns; otherwise, it
continues and performs the following:</p>

<p>- Descends recursively to each of the widgets managed
children and calls the realize procedures. Primitive widgets
that instantiate children are responsible for realizing
those children themselves.</p>

<p>- Maps all of the managed children windows that have
mapped_when_managed True. (If a widget is managed but
mapped_when_managed is False, the widget is allocated visual
space but is not displayed. Some people seem to like this to
indicate certain states.)</p>

<p>If the widget is a top-level shell widget (that is, it
has no parent), and mapped_when_managed is True,
XtRealizeWidget maps the widget win- dow.</p>

<p>The XtIsRealized function returns True if the widget has
been realized, that is, if the widget has a nonzero X window
ID.</p>

<p>Some widget procedures (for example, set_values) might
wish to operate differently after the widget has been
realized.</p>

<p>The XtUnrealizeWidget function destroys the windows of
an existing wid- get and all of its children (recursively
down the widget tree). To recreate the windows at a later
time, call XtRealizeWidget again. If the widget was managed,
it will be unmanaged automatically before its window is
freed.</p>
