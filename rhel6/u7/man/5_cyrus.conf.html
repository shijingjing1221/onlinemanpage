<p>CYRUS.CONF(5) CYRUS.CONF(5)</p>

<p>*</p>

<p>NAME cyrus.conf - Cyrus configuration file</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION /etc/cyrus.conf is the configuration file
for the Cyrus master process. It defines the startup
procedures, services and events to be spawned by master.</p>

<p>The /etc/cyrus.conf file consists of a series of entries
divided into sections of the form</p>

<p>section { name arguments ... ... ... }</p>

<p>where section is the name of the section, name is the
name of the entry and arguments is the whitespace-separated
list of arguments for the entry.</p>

<p>Blank lines and lines beginning with # are ignored.</p>

<p>SECTION DESCRIPTIONS The paragraphs below detail the
three sections (START, SERVICES, EVENTS) that can be placed
in the /etc/cyrus.conf file. The arguments that are
available for each entry within the section are described,
and each arguments default value is shown.</p>

<p>Arguments can appear in any order. Some arguments have
no default value, these are listed with &lt;no default&gt;.
For string arguments, the value MUST be enclosed in double
quotes.</p>

<p>START This section lists the processes to run before any
SERVICES are spawned. This section is typically used to
initialize databases and start long running daemons.</p>

<p>cmd=&lt;no default&gt; The command (with options) to
spawn as a child process. This string argument is
required.</p>

<p>SERVICES This section is the heart of the
/etc/cyrus.conf file. It lists the processes that should be
spawned to handle client connections made on certain
Internet/UNIX sockets.</p>

<p>cmd=&lt;no default&gt; The command (with options) to
spawn as a child process. This string argument is
required.</p>

<p>listen=&lt;no default&gt; The UNIX or internet socket to
listen on. This string field is required and takes one of
the following forms:</p>

<p>path [ host : ] port</p>

<p>where path is the explicit path to a UNIX socket, host
is either the hostname or bracket-enclosed IP address of a
network inter- face, and port is either a port number or
service name (as listed in /etc/services).</p>

<p>proto=tcp The protocol used for this service (tcp, tcp4,
tcp6, udp, udp4, udp6). This string argument is
optional.</p>

<p>tcp4, udp4: These arguments are used to bind the service
to IPv4 only. tcp6, udp6: These arguments are used to bind
the service to IPv6 only, if the operating system supports
this. tcp, udp: These arguments are used to bind to both
IPv4 and IPv6 if possible.</p>

<p>prefork=0 The number of instances of this service to
always have running and waiting for a connection (for faster
initial response time). This integer value is optional.</p>

<p>maxchild=-1 The maximum number of instances of this
service to spawn. A value of -1 means unlimited. This
integer value is optional.</p>

<p>maxfds=256 The maximum number of file descriptors to
which to limit this pro- cess. This integer value is
optional.</p>

<p>EVENTS This section lists processes that should be run
at specific intervals, similar to cron jobs. This section is
typically used to perform sched- uled
cleanup/maintenance.</p>

<p>cmd=&lt;no default&gt; The command (with options) to
spawn as a child process. This string argument is
required.</p>

<p>period=0 The interval (in minutes) at which to run the
command. This inte- ger value is optional, but SHOULD be a
positive integer &gt; 10.</p>

<p>at=&lt;hhmm&gt; The time (24-hour format) at which to
run the command each day. If set to a valid time
(0000-2359), period is automatically set to 1440. This
string argument is optional.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE # example cyrus.conf</p>

<p>START { recover cmd=&quot;ctl_cyrusdb -r&quot; }</p>

<p>SERVICES { imap cmd=&quot;imapd&quot;
listen=&quot;imap&quot; prefork=1 imaps cmd=&quot;imapd
-s&quot; listen=&quot;imaps&quot; prefork=0 lmtpunix
cmd=&quot;lmtpd&quot;
listen=&quot;/var/imap/socket/lmtp&quot; lmtp
cmd=&quot;lmtpd&quot; listen=&quot;localhost:lmtp&quot;
}</p>

<p>EVENTS { checkpoint cmd=&quot;ctl_cyrusdb -c&quot;
period=30 delprune cmd=&quot;cyr_expire -E 3&quot; at=0400
tlsprune cmd=&quot;tls_prune&quot; at=0400 }</p>

<p>ACCESS CONTROL When TCP Wrappers is used to control
access to Cyrus services, the name of the service entry
should be used as the process name in the hosts_access(5)
table. For instance, in the example above, &quot;imap&quot;,
&quot;imaps&quot;, &quot;lmtpunix&quot; and &quot;lmtp&quot;
would be used as the process names. This allows a single
daemon such as imapd to be run in different modes or
configurations (i.e., SSL and non-SSL enabled) yet still
have sepa- rate access control rules.</p>
