<p>NAME ecpg - embedded SQL C preprocessor</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ecpg [ option... ] file...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION ecpg is the embedded SQL preprocessor for C
programs. It converts C programs with embedded SQL
statements to normal C code by replacing the SQL invocations
with special function calls. The output files can then be
processed with any C compiler tool chain.</p>

<p>ecpg will convert each input file given on the command
line to the cor- responding C output file. Input files
preferably have the extension .pgc, in which case the
extension will be replaced by .c to determine the output
file name. If the extension of the input file is not .pgc,
then the output file name is computed by appending .c to the
full file name. The output file name can also be overridden
using the -o option.</p>

<p>This reference page does not describe the embedded SQL
language. See in the documentation for more information on
that topic.</p>

<p>OPTIONS ecpg accepts the following command-line
arguments:</p>

<p>-c Automatically generate certain C code from SQL code.
Currently, this works for EXEC SQL TYPE.</p>

<p>-C mode Set a compatibility mode. mode can be INFORMIX
or INFORMIX_SE.</p>

<p>-D symbol Define a C preprocessor symbol.</p>

<p>-i Parse system include files as well.</p>

<p>-I directory Specify an additional include path, used to
find files included via EXEC SQL INCLUDE. Defaults are .
(current directory), /usr/local/include, the PostgreSQL
include directory which is defined at compile time (default:
/usr/local/pgsql/include), and /usr/include, in that
order.</p>

<p>-o filename Specifies that ecpg should write all its
output to the given filename.</p>

<p>-r option Selects a run-time behavior. Currently, option
can only be no_indicator.</p>

<p>-t Turn on autocommit of transactions. In this mode,
each SQL com- mand is automatically committed unless it is
inside an explicit transaction block. In the default mode,
commands are committed only when EXEC SQL COMMIT is
issued.</p>

<p>-v Print additional information including the version
and the include path.</p>

<p>--help Show a brief summary of the command usage, then
exit.</p>

<p>--version Output version information, then exit.</p>

<p>NOTES When compiling the preprocessed C code files, the
compiler needs to be able to find the ECPG header files in
the PostgreSQL include directory. Therefore, one might have
to use the -I option when invoking the com- piler (e.g.,
-I/usr/local/pgsql/include).</p>

<p>Programs using C code with embedded SQL have to be
linked against the libecpg library, for example using the
linker options -L/usr/local/pgsql/lib -lecpg.</p>

<p>The value of either of these directories that is
appropriate for the installation can be found out using
pg_config(1).</p>

<p>EXAMPLES If you have an embedded SQL C source file named
prog1.pgc, you can cre- ate an executable program using the
following sequence of commands:</p>

<p>ecpg prog1.pgc cc -I/usr/local/pgsql/include -c prog1.c
cc -o prog1 prog1.o -L/usr/local/pgsql/lib -lecpg</p>
