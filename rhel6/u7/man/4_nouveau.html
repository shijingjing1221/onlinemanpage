<p>NAME nouveau - NVIDIA video driver</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS Section &quot;Device&quot; Identifier
&quot;devname&quot; Driver &quot;nouveau&quot; ...
EndSection</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION nouveau is an Xorg driver for NVIDIA video
cards. The driver supports 2D acceleration and provides
support for the following framebuffer depths: (15,) 16 and
24. TrueColor visuals are supported for these depths.</p>

<p>SUPPORTED HARDWARE The nouveau driver supports PCI,
PCI-Express and AGP video cards based on the following
NVIDIA chips:</p>

<p>RIVA TNT NV4</p>

<p>RIVA TNT2 NV5</p>

<p>GeForce 256, QUADRO NV10</p>

<p>GeForce2, QUADRO2 NV11 &amp; NV15</p>

<p>GeForce3, QUADRO DCC NV20</p>

<p>nForce, nForce2 NV1A, NV1F</p>

<p>GeForce4, QUADRO4 NV17, NV18, NV25, NV28</p>

<p>GeForce FX, QUADRO FX NV30, NV31, NV34, NV35, NV36,
NV37, NV38</p>

<p>GeForce 6XXX NV40, NV41, NV43, NV44, NV45, C51</p>

<p>GeForce 7XXX G70, G71, G72, G73</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION DETAILS Please refer to xorg.conf(5) for
general configuration details. This section only covers
configuration details specific to this driver.</p>

<p>The driver auto-detects the chipset type and the amount
of video memory present for all chips.</p>

<p>The following driver Options are supported:</p>

<p>Option &quot;HWCursor&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Enable
or disable the HW cursor. Default: on.</p>

<p>Option &quot;NoAccel&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Disable
or enable acceleration. Default: acceleration is
enabled.</p>

<p>Option &quot;ShadowFB&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Enable
or disable use of the shadow framebuffer layer. Default:
off.</p>

<p>Option &quot;WrappedFB&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Enable
or disable wfb, only affects nv50+. Useful for some legacy
configurations where high rendering latency is perceived.
Default: wfb is disabled.</p>

<p>Option &quot;GLXVBlank&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
Synchronize GLX clients to VBlank. Useful where tearing is a
problem, harmful if the GPU isnt fast enough to keep up with
the monitor refresh rate. Default: off.</p>

<p>Option &quot;ZaphodHeads&quot; &quot;string&quot;
Specify the randr output(s) to use with zaphod mode for a
par- ticular driver instance. If you use this option you
most use this option for all instances of the driver. For
example: Option &quot;ZaphodHeads&quot;
&quot;LVDS,VGA-0&quot; will assign xrandr outputs LVDS and
VGA-0 to this instance of the driver.</p>

<p>Option &quot;PageFlip&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Enable
DRI2 page flipping. Default: on.</p>

<p>Option &quot;SwapLimit&quot; &quot;integer&quot; Set
maximum allowed number of pending OpenGL double-buffer swaps
for a drawable before a client is blocked. A value of 1
corresponds to double-buffering. A value of 2 cor- responds
to triple-buffering. Higher values may allow higher
framerate, but also increase lag for interactive
applications, e.g., games. Nouveau currently reliably
supports a maximum value of 2 on XOrg 1.12+. A maximum
setting of 2 on older x-servers is allowed, but it will
break conformance with the OpenML OML_sync_control
specification and will cause failure of soft- ware that
relies on correct presentation timing behaviour as defined
in that specification. Default: 2 for XOrg 1.12+, 1 for
older servers.</p>
