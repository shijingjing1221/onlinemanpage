<p>GETGRNAM(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual GETGRNAM(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME getgrnam, getgrnam_r - search group database for a
name</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;grp.h&gt;</p>

<p>struct group *getgrnam(const char *name);</p>

<p>int getgrnam_r(const char *name, struct group *grp, char
*buffer, size_t bufsize, struct group **result);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The getgrnam() function shall search the
group database for an entry with a matching name.</p>

<p>The getgrnam() function need not be reentrant. A
function that is not required to be reentrant is not
required to be thread-safe.</p>

<p>The getgrnam_r() function shall update the group
structure pointed to by grp and store a pointer to that
structure at the location pointed to by result. The
structure shall contain an entry from the group database
with a matching gid or name. Storage referenced by the group
structure is allocated from the memory provided with the
buffer parameter, which is bufsize bytes in size. The
maximum size needed for this buffer can be determined with
the {_SC_GETGR_R_SIZE_MAX} sysconf() parameter. A NULL
pointer is returned at the location pointed to by result on
error or if the requested entry is not found.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The getgrnam() function shall return a
pointer to a struct group with the structure defined in
&lt;grp.h&gt; with a matching entry if one is found. The
getgrnam() function shall return a null pointer if either
the requested entry was not found, or an error occurred. On
error, errno shall be set to indicate the error.</p>

<p>The return value may point to a static area which is
overwritten by a subsequent call to getgrent(), getgrgid(),
or getgrnam().</p>

<p>If successful, the getgrnam_r() function shall return
zero; otherwise, an error number shall be returned to
indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The getgrnam() and getgrnam_r() functions may
fail if:</p>

<p>EIO An I/O error has occurred.</p>

<p>EINTR A signal was caught during getgrnam().</p>

<p>EMFILE {OPEN_MAX} file descriptors are currently open in
the calling process.</p>

<p>ENFILE The maximum allowable number of files is
currently open in the system.</p>

<p>The getgrnam_r() function may fail if:</p>

<p>ERANGE Insufficient storage was supplied via buffer and
bufsize to con- tain the data to be referenced by the
resulting group structure.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE Applications wishing to check for
error situations should set errno to 0 before calling
getgrnam(). If errno is set on return, an error
occurred.</p>

<p>The getgrnam_r() function is thread-safe and shall
return values in a user-supplied buffer instead of possibly
using a static data area that may be overwritten by each
call.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
