<p>XkbAddGeomColor(3) XKB FUNCTIONS XkbAddGeomColor(3)</p>

<p>NAME XkbAddGeomColor - Add one color name to an existing
keyboard geometry description</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS XkbColorPtr XkbAddGeomColor (XkbGeometryPtr
geom, char *spec, unsigned int pixel);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS - geom geometry to be updated</p>

<p>- spec color to be added</p>

<p>- pixel color to be added</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Xkb provides functions to add a single new
element to the top-level keyboard geometry. In each case the
num_ * fields of the corresponding structure is incremented
by 1. These functions do not change sz_* unless there is no
more room in the array. Some of these functions fill in the
values of the element s structure from the arguments. For
other functions, you must explicitly write code to fill the
structures ele- ments.</p>

<p>The top-level geometry description includes a list of
geometry proper- ties. A geometry property associates an
arbitrary string with an equally arbitrary name. Programs
that display images of keyboards can use geometry properties
as hints, but they are not interpreted by Xkb. No other
geometry structures refer to geometry properties.</p>

<p>XkbAddGeomColor adds the specified color name and pixel
to the speci- fied geometry geom. The top-level geometry
description includes a list of up to MaxColors (32) color
names. A color name is a string whose interpretation is not
specified by Xkb and neither is the pixel values
interpretation. All other geometry data structures refer to
colors using their indices in this global list or pointers
to colors in this list. XkbAddGeomColor returns NULL if any
of the parameters is empty or if it was not able to allocate
space for the color. To allocate space for an arbitrary
number of colors to a geometry, use the XkbAl- locGeomColors
function.</p>

pixel; / color */ char * spec; / color name */ }
