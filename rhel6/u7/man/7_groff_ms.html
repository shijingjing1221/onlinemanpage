<p>NAME groff_ms - groff ms macros</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS groff -ms [ options... ] [ files... ] groff -m
ms [ options... ] [ files... ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page describes the GNU version
of the ms macros, part of the groff typesetting system. The
ms macros are mostly compatible with the documented behavior
of the 4.3 BSD Unix ms macros (see Differences from troff ms
below for details). The ms macros are suitable for reports,
letters, books, and technical documentation.</p>

<p>USAGE The ms macro package expects files to have a
certain amount of struc- ture. The simplest documents can
begin with a paragraph macro and con- sist of text separated
by paragraph macros or even blank lines. Longer documents
have a structure as follows:</p>

<p>Document type If you use the RP (report) macro at the
beginning of the docu- ment, groff prints the cover page
information on its own page; otherwise it prints the
information on the first page with your document text
immediately following. Other document formats found in
AT&amp;T troff are specific to AT&amp;T or Berkeley, and are
not supported in groff ms.</p>

<p>Format and layout By setting number registers, you can
change your documents type (font and size), margins,
spacing, headers and footers, and footnotes. See Document
control registers below for more details.</p>

<p>Cover page A cover page consists of a title, and
optionally the authors name and institution, an abstract,
and the date. See Cover page macros below for more
details.</p>

<p>Body Following the cover page is your document. It
consists of para- graphs, headings, and lists.</p>

<p>Table of contents Longer documents usually include a
table of contents, which you can add by placing the TC macro
at the end of your document.</p>

<p>Document control registers The following table lists the
document control number registers. For the sake of
consistency, set registers related to margins at the begin-
ning of your document, or just after the RP macro.</p>

<p>Cover page macros Use the following macros to create a
cover page for your document in the order shown.</p>

<p>.RP [no] Specifies the report format for your document.
The report for- mat creates a separate cover page. With no
RP macro, groff prints a subset of the cover page on page 1
of your document.</p>

<p>If you use the optional no argument, groff prints a
title page but does not repeat any of the title page
information (title, author, abstract, etc.) on page 1 of the
document.</p>

<p>.P1 (P-one) Prints the header on page 1. The default is
to suppress the header.</p>

<p>.DA [xxx] (optional) Print the current date, or the
arguments to the macro if any, on the title page (if
specified) and in the footers. This is the default for
nroff.</p>

<p>.ND [xxx] (optional) Print the current date, or the
arguments to the macro if any, on the title page (if
specified) but not in the footers. This is the default for
troff.</p>

<p>.TL Specifies the document title. Groff collects text
following the TL macro into the title, until reaching the
author name or abstract.</p>

<p>.AU Specifies the author s name. You can specify
multiple authors by using an AU macro for each author.</p>

<p>.AI Specifies the author s institution. You can specify
multiple institutions.</p>

<p>.AB [no] Begins the abstract. The default is to print
the word ABSTRACT, centered and in italics, above the text
of the abstract. The option no suppresses this heading.</p>

<p>.AE End the abstract.</p>

<p>Paragraphs Use the PP macro to create indented
paragraphs, and the LP macro to create paragraphs with no
initial indent.</p>

<p>The QP macro indents all text at both left and right
margins. The effect is identical to the HTML
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt; element. The next para- graph or heading
returns margins to normal.</p>

<p>The XP macro produces an exdented paragraph. The first
line of the paragraph begins at the left margin, and
subsequent lines are indented (the opposite of PP).</p>

<p>Headings Use headings to create a hierarchical structure
for your document. The ms macros print headings in bold
using the same font family and point size as the body
text.</p>

<p>The following heading macros are available:</p>

<p>.NH xx Numbered heading. The argument xx is either a
numeric argument to indicate the level of the heading, or S
xx xx &quot;...&quot; to set the section number explicitly.
If you specify heading levels out of sequence, such as
invoking .NH 3 after .NH 1, groff prints a warning on
standard error.</p>

<p>.SH Unnumbered subheading.</p>

<p>Highlighting The ms macros provide a variety of methods
to highlight or emphasize text:</p>

<p>.B [txt [post [pre]]] Sets its first argument in bold
type. If you specify a second argument, groff prints it in
the previous font after the bold text, with no intervening
space (this allows you to set punctua- tion after the
highlighted text without highlighting the punctu- ation).
Similarly, it prints the third argument (if any) in the
previous font before the first argument. For example,</p>

<p>.B foo ) (</p>

<p>prints (foo).</p>

<p>If you give this macro no arguments, groff prints all
text fol- lowing in bold until the next highlighting,
paragraph, or head- ing macro.</p>

<p>.R [txt [post [pre]]] Sets its first argument in roman
(or regular) type. It operates similarly to the B macro
otherwise.</p>

<p>.I [txt [post [pre]]] Sets its first argument in italic
type. It operates similarly to the B macro otherwise.</p>

<p>.CW [txt [post [pre]]] Sets its first argument in a
constant width face. It operates similarly to the B macro
otherwise.</p>

<p>.BI [txt [post [pre]]] Sets its first argument in bold
italic type. It operates simi- larly to the B macro
otherwise.</p>

<p>.BX [txt] Prints its argument and draws a box around it.
If you want to box a string that contains spaces, use a
digit-width space ( ).</p>

<p>.UL [txt [post]] Prints its first argument with an
underline. If you specify a second argument, groff prints it
in the previous font after the underlined text, with no
intervening space.</p>

<p>.LG Prints all text following in larger type (2 points
larger than the current point size) until the next font
size, highlighting, paragraph, or heading macro. You can
specify this macro multi- ple times to enlarge the point
size as needed.</p>

<p>.SM Prints all text following in smaller type (2 points
smaller than the current point size) until the next type
size, highlighting, paragraph, or heading macro. You can
specify this macro multi- ple times to reduce the point size
as needed.</p>

<p>.NL Prints all text following in the normal point size
(that is, the value of the PS register).</p>

<p>*{tex*} Print the enclosed text as a superscript.</p>

<p>Indents You may need to indent sections of text. A
typical use for indents is to create nested lists and
sublists.</p>

<p>Use the RS and RE macros to start and end a section of
indented text, respectively. The PI register controls the
amount of indent.</p>

<p>You can nest indented sections as deeply as needed by
using multiple, nested pairs of RS and RE.</p>

<p>Lists The IP macro handles duties for all lists. Its
syntax is as follows:</p>

<p>.IP [marker [width]]</p>

<p>The marker is usually a bullet character(bu for
unordered lists, a number (or auto-incrementing number
register) for num- bered lists, or a word or phrase for
indented (glossary-style) lists.</p>

<p>The width specifies the indent for the body of each list
item. Once specified, the indent remains the same for all
list items in the document until specified again.</p>

<p>Tab stops Use the ta request to set tab stops as needed.
Use the TA macro to reset tabs to the default (every 5n).
You can redefine the TA macro to create a different set of
default tab stops.</p>

<p>Displays and keeps Use displays to show text-based
examples or figures (such as code list- ings). Displays turn
off filling, so lines of code can be displayed as-is without
inserting br requests in between each line. Displays can be
kept on a single page, or allowed to break across pages. The
following table shows the display types available.</p>

<p>Display macro Type of display With keep No keep
---------------------------------------------------------
.DS L .LD Left-justified. .DS I [indent] .ID Indented
(default indent in the DI register). .DS B .BD
Block-centered (left-justi- fied, longest line centered).
.DS C .CD Centered. .DS R .RD Right-justified.
---------------------------------------------------------</p>

<p>Use the DE macro to end any display type.</p>

<p>To keep text together on a page, such as a paragraph
that refers to a table (or list, or other item) immediately
following, use the KS and KE macros. The KS macro begins a
block of text to be kept on a single page, and the KE macro
ends the block.</p>

<p>You can specify a floating keep using the KF and KE
macros. If the keep cannot fit on the current page, groff
holds the contents of the keep and allows text following the
keep (in the source file) to fill in the remainder of the
current page. When the page breaks, whether by an explicit
bp request or by reaching the end of the page, groff prints
the floating keep at the top of the new page. This is useful
for printing large graphics or tables that do not need to
appear exactly where specified.</p>

<p>Tables, figures, equations, and references The -ms
macros support the standard groff preprocessors: tbl, pic,
eqn, and refer. Mark text meant for preprocessors by
enclosing it in pairs of tags as follows:</p>

<p>.TS [H] and .TE Denotes a table, to be processed by the
tbl preprocessor. The optional H argument instructs groff to
create a running header with the information up to the TH
macro. Groff prints the header at the beginning of the
table; if the table runs onto another page, groff prints the
header on the next page as well.</p>

<p>.PS and .PE Denotes a graphic, to be processed by the
pic preprocessor. You can create a pic file by hand, using
the AT&amp;T pic manual avail- able on the Web as a
reference, or by using a graphics program such as xfig.</p>

<p>.EQ [align] and .EN Denotes an equation, to be processed
by the eqn preprocessor. The optional align argument can be
C, L, or I to center (the default), left-justify, or indent
the equation.</p>

<p>.[ and .] Denotes a reference, to be processed by the
refer preprocessor. The GNU refer(1) manual page provides a
comprehensive reference to the preprocessor and the format
of the bibliographic database.</p>

<p>Footnotes The ms macros provide a flexible footnote
system. You can specify a numbered footnote by using the**
escape, followed by the text of the footnote enclosed by FS
and FE macros.</p>

<p>You can specify symbolic footnotes by placing the mark
character (such as (dg for the dagger character) in the body
text, followed by the text of the footnote enclosed by FS(dg
and FE macros.</p>

<p>You can control how groff prints footnote numbers by
changing the value of the FF register as follows:</p>

<p>0 Prints the footnote number as a superscript; indents
the footnote (default).</p>

<p>1 Prints the number followed by a period (like 1.) and
indents the footnote.</p>

<p>2 Like 1, without an indent.</p>

<p>3 Like 1, but prints the footnote number as a hanging
para- graph.</p>

<p>You can use footnotes safely within keeps and displays,
but avoid using numbered footnotes within floating keeps.
You can set a second** between a** and its corresponding
.FS; as long as each .FS occurs after the corresponding**
and the occurrences of .FS are in the same order as the
corresponding occurrences of**.</p>

<p>Headers and footers There are two ways to define headers
and footers:</p>

<p>&middot; Use the strings LH, CH, and RH to set the left,
center, and right headers; use LF, CF, and RF to set the
left, center, and right foot- ers. This works best for
documents that do not distinguish between odd and even
pages.</p>

<p>&middot; Use the OH and EH macros to define headers for
the odd and even pages; and OF and EF macros to define
footers for the odd and even pages. This is more flexible
than defining the individual strings. The syntax for these
macros is as follows:</p>

<p>.OHlefcenteright</p>

<p>You can replace the quote () marks with any character
not appearing in the header or footer text.</p>

<p>Margins You control margins using a set of number
registers. The following ta- ble lists the register names
and defaults:</p>

<p>Reg. Definition Effective Default
------------------------------------------------------ PO
Page offset (left mar- next page 1i gin) LL Line length next
para. 6i LT Header/footer length next para. 6i HM Top
(header) margin next page 1i FM Bottom (footer) margin next
page 1i
------------------------------------------------------</p>

<p>Note that there is no right margin setting. The
combination of page offset and line length provide the
information necessary to derive the right margin.</p>

<p>Multiple columns The ms macros can set text in as many
columns as will reasonably fit on the page. The following
macros are available. All of them force a page break if a
multi-column mode is already set. However, if the cur- rent
mode is single-column, starting a multi-column mode does not
force a page break.</p>

<p>.1C Single-column mode.</p>

<p>.2C Two-column mode.</p>

<p>.MC [width [gutter]] Multi-column mode. If you specify
no arguments, it is equiva- lent to the 2C macro. Otherwise,
width is the width of each column and gutter is the space
between columns. The MINGW num- ber register is the default
gutter width.</p>

<p>Creating a table of contents Wrap text that you want to
appear in the table of contents in XS and XE macros. Use the
TC macro to print the table of contents at the end of the
document, resetting the page number to i (Roman numeral
1).</p>

<p>You can manually create a table of contents by
specifying a page number as the first argument to XS. Add
subsequent entries using the XA macro. For example:</p>

<p>.XS 1 Introduction .XA 2 A Brief History of the Universe
.XA 729 Details of Galactic Formation ... .XE</p>

<p>Use the PX macro to print a manually-generated table of
contents with- out resetting the page number.</p>

<p>If you give the argument no to either PX or TC, groff
suppresses print- ing the title specified by the*[TOC]
string.</p>

<p>DIFFERENCES FROM troff ms The groff ms macros are a
complete re-implementation, using no original AT&amp;T code.
Since they take advantage of the extended features in groff,
they cannot be used with AT&amp;T troff. Other differences
include:</p>

<p>&middot; The internals of groff ms differ from the
internals of Unix ms. Documents that depend upon
implementation details of Unix ms may not format properly
with groff ms.</p>

<p>&middot; The error-handling policy of groff ms is to
detect and report errors, rather than silently to ignore
them.</p>

<p>&middot; Bell Labs localisms are not implemented.</p>

<p>&middot; Berkeley localisms, in particular the TM and CT
macros, are not implemented.</p>

<p>&middot; Groff ms does not work in compatibility mode
(e.g. with the -C option).</p>

<p>&middot; There is no support for typewriter-like
devices.</p>

<p>&middot; Groff ms does not provide cut marks.</p>

<p>&middot; Multiple line spacing is not supported (use a
larger vertical spac- ing instead).</p>

<p>&middot; Some Unix ms documentation says that the CW and
GW number registers can be used to control the column width
and gutter width respec- tively. These number registers are
not used in groff ms.</p>

<p>&middot; Macros that cause a reset (paragraphs,
headings, etc.) may change the indent. Macros that change
the indent do not increment or decrement the indent, but
rather set it absolutely. This can cause problems for
documents that define additional macros of their own. The
solution is to use not the in request but instead the RS and
RE macros.</p>

<p>&middot; The number register GS is set to 1 by the groff
ms macros, but is not used by the Unix ms macros. Documents
that need to determine whether they are being formatted with
Unix ms or groff ms should use this number register.</p>

<p>Strings You can redefine the following strings to adapt
the groff ms macros to languages other than English:</p>

<p>String Default Value ---------------------------------
REFERENCES References ABSTRACT ABSTRACT TOC Table of
Contents MONTH1 January MONTH2 February MONTH3 March MONTH4
April MONTH5 May MONTH6 June MONTH7 July MONTH8 August
MONTH9 September MONTH10 October MONTH11 November MONTH12
December ---------------------------------</p>

<p>The*- string produces an em dash like this.</p>

<p>Text Settings The FAM string sets the default font
family. If this string is unde- fined at initialization, it
is set to Times.</p>

<p>The point size, vertical spacing, and inter-paragraph
spacing for foot- notes are controlled by the number
registers FPS, FVS, and FPD; at ini- tialization these are
set ton(PS-2,n[FPS]+2, andn(PD/2 respec- tively. If any of
these registers are defined before initialization, the
initialization macro does not change them.</p>

<p>The hyphenation flags (as set by the hy request) are set
from the HY register; the default is 14.</p>

<p>Improved accent marks (as originally defined in Berkeley
s ms version) are available by specifying the AM macro at
the beginning of your docu- ment. You can place an accent
over most characters by specifying the string defining the
accent directly after the character. For example, *~
produces an n with a tilde over it.</p>

<p>NAMING CONVENTIONS The following conventions are used
for names of macros, strings and number registers. External
names available to documents that use the groff ms macros
contain only uppercase letters and digits.</p>

<p>Internally the macros are divided into modules; naming
conventions are as follows:</p>

<p>&middot; Names used only within one module are of the
form module*name.</p>

<p>&middot; Names used outside the module in which they are
defined are of the form module@name.</p>

<p>&middot; Names associated with a particular environment
are of the form environment:name; these are used only within
the par module.</p>

<p>&middot; name does not have a module prefix.</p>

<p>&middot; Constructed names used to implement arrays are
of the form array!index.</p>

<p>Thus the groff ms macros reserve the following
names:</p>

<p>&middot; Names containing the characters *, @, and
:.</p>

<p>&middot; Names containing only uppercase letters and
digits.</p>
