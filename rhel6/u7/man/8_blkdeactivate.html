<p>NAME blkdeactivate utility to deactivate block
devices</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS blkdeactivate [-d dm_options] [-e] [-h] [-l
lvm_options] [-u] [-v] [device]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION blkdeactivate utility deactivates block
devices. If a device is mounted, the utility can unmount it
automatically before trying to deactivate. The utility
currently supports device-mapper devices, including LVM
volumes. LVM volumes are handled directly using the lvm(8)
command. Other device-mapper based devices are handled using
the dmsetup(8) command.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -d, --dmoption dm_options Comma separated list
of device-mapper specific options. Accepted dmsetup(8)
options are:</p>

<p>retry Retry removal several times in case of
failure.</p>

<p>force Force device removal.</p>

<p>-e, --errors Show errors reported from tools called by
blkdeactivate. Without this option, any error messages from
these external tools are suppressed and the blkdeactivate
itself provides only a summary message about device being
skipped or not.</p>

<p>-h, --help Display the help text.</p>

<p>-l, --lvmoption lvm_options Comma separated list of LVM
specific options:</p>

<p>retry Retry removal several times in case of
failure.</p>

<p>wholevg Deactivate the whole LVM Volume Group when
processing a Logical Volume. Deactivating Volume Group as a
whole takes less time than deactivating each Logical Volume
separately.</p>

<p>-u, --umount Unmount a mounted device before trying to
deactivate it. With- out this option used, a device that is
mounted is not deacti- vated.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose Run in verbose mode. Use --vv for even
more verbose mode.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Deactivate all supported block devices found in
the system. If a device is mounted, skip its
deactivation.</p>

<p>blkdeactivate</p>

<p>Deactivate all supported block devices found in the
system. If a device is mounted, unmount it first if
possible.</p>

<p>blkdeactivate -u</p>

<p>Deactivate supplied device together with all its
holders. If any of the devices processed is mounted, unmount
it first if possible.</p>

<p>blkdeactivate -u /dev/vg/lvol0</p>

<p>Deactivate all supported block devices found in the
system. Retry deac- tivation of device-mapper devices in
case the deactivation fails. Deac- tivate the whole Volume
Group at once when processing an LVM Logical Volume.</p>

<p>blkdeactivate -u -d retry -l wholevg</p>

<p>Deactivate all supported block devices found in the
system. Retry deac- tivation of device-mapper devices in
case the deactivation fails and force removal.</p>

<p>blkdeactivate -d force,retry</p>
