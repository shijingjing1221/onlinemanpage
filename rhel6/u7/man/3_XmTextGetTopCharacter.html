<p>NAME XmTextGetTopCharacter A Text function that accesses
the position of the first character displayed</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;Xm/Text.h&gt; XmTextPosition
XmTextGetTopCharacter( Widget widget);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION XmTextGetTopCharacter accesses the position
of the text at the top of the Text widget. If there is no
text in the Text widget (in other words, XmNvalue contains
an empty string), then XmTextGetTopCharacter returns 0.</p>

<p>Suppose that the XmNtopCharacter resource has been set
to a value greater than the number of characters in the text
widget. In this case, XmTextGetTopCharacter returns an
XmTextPosition value identifying the position of the first
character in the last line of text in a multiline case;
otherwise, it identifies the position of the last character
in the line.</p>

<p>widget Specifies the Text widget ID</p>

<p>For a complete definition of Text and its associated
resources, see XmText(3).</p>

<p>RETURN Returns an XmTextPosition value that indicates
the state of the XmN- topCharacter resource. This is an
integer number of characters from the beginning of the text
buffer. The first character position is 0 (zero).</p>
