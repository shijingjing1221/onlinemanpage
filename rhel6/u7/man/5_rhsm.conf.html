<p>NAME rhsm.conf - Configuration file for the
subscription-mananager tooling</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The rhsm.conf file is the configuration file
for various subscription manager tooling. This includes
subscription-manager, subscription-manager-gui, rhsmcertd,
and virt-who.</p>

<p>[SERVER] OPTIONS hostname The hostname of the
subscription service being used. The default is the Red Hat
Customer Portal which is subscription.rhn.redhat.com.</p>

<p>prefix Server prefix where the subscription service is
registered.</p>

<p>port The port which the subscription service is
listening on.</p>

<p>insecure This flag enables or disables certification
verification using the certificate authorities which are
installed in /etc/rhsm/ca.</p>

<p>ssl_verify_depth Sets the number of certificates which
should be used to verify the servers identity. This is an
advanced control which can be used to secure on premise
installations.</p>

<p>proxy_hostname Set this to a non-blank value if
subscription-manager should use a reverse proxy to access
the subscription service. This sets the host for the reverse
proxy.</p>

<p>proxy_port Set this to a non-blank value if
subscription-manager should use a reverse proxy to access
the subscription service. This sets the port for the reverse
proxy.</p>

<p>proxy_username Set this to a non-blank value if
subscription-manager should use an authenticated reverse
proxy to access the subscription service. This sets the
username for the reverse proxy.</p>

<p>proxy_password Set this to a non-blank value if
subscription-manager should use an authenticated reverse
proxy to access the subscription service. This sets the
password for the reverse proxy.</p>

<p>[RHSM] OPTIONS baseurl This setting is the prefix for
all content which is managed by the subscription service.
This should be the hostname for the Red Hat CDN, the local
Satellite or Capsule depending on your deployment.</p>

<p>ca_cert_dir The location for the certificates which are
used to communicate with the server and to pulldown
content.</p>

<p>repo_ca_cert The certificate to use for server side
authentication during content downloads.</p>

<p>productCertDir The directory where product certificates
should be stored.</p>

<p>entitlementCertDir The directory where entitlement
certificates should be stored.</p>

<p>consumerCertDir The directory where the consumers
identity certificate is stored.</p>

<p>manage_repos Set this to 1 if subscription manager
should manage a yum repos file. If set, it will manage the
file /etc/yum.repos.d/redhat.repo. If set to 0 then the
subscription is only used for tracking purposes, not
content. The /etc/yum.repos.d/redhat.repo file will either
be purged or deleted.</p>

<p>full_refresh_on_yum Set to 1 if the
/etc/yum.repos.d/redhat.repo should be updated with every
server command. This will make yum less efficient, but can
ensure that the most recent data is brought down from the
subscription service.</p>

<p>report_package_profile Set to 1 if rhsmcertd should
report the systems current package profile to the
subscription service. This report helps the subscription
service provide better errata notifications.</p>

<p>pluginDir The directory to search for subscription
manager plugins</p>

<p>pluginConfDir The directory to search for plugin
configuration files</p>

<p>[RHSMCERTD] OPTIONS certCheckInterval The number of
minutes between runs of the rhsmcertd daemon</p>

<p>autoAttachInterval The number of minutes between
attempts to run auto-attach on this consumer.</p>
