<p>PMSTORE(1) PMSTORE(1)</p>

<p>NAME pmstore - modify performance metric values</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pmstore [-L] [-h host] [-i instances] [-K spec]
[-n pmnsfile] metric- name value</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Under certain circumstances, it is useful to
be able to modify the val- ues of performance metrics, for
example to re-initialize counters or to assign new values to
metrics that act as control variables.</p>

<p>pmstore changes the current values for the nominated
instances of a single performance metric, as identified by
metricname and the list of instance identifiers following
the -i argument. instances must be a single argument, with
elements of the list separated by commas and/or white space.
By default all instances of metricname will be updated.</p>

<p>Normally pmstore operates on the default Performance
Metrics Name Space (PMNS), however if the -n option is
specified an alternative namespace is loaded from the file
pmnsfile.</p>

<p>Unless directed to another host by the -h option,
pmstore will interact with the Performance Metric Collector
Daemon (PMCD) on the local host.</p>

<p>The -L option causes pmstore to use a local context to
store to metrics from PMDAs on the local host without PMCD.
Only some metrics are available in this mode. The -h and -L
options are mutually exclusive.</p>

<p>The interpretation of value is dependent on the syntax
used in its specification and the underlying data type of
metricname, as follows.</p>

<p>1. If the metric has an integer type, then value should
be an optional leading hyphen, followed either by decimal
digits or 0x and some hexadecimal digits. 0X is also
acceptable in lieu of 0x. See strtol(3C) and the related
routines.</p>

<p>2. If the metric has a floating point type, then value
should be either in the form of an integer described above,
or a fixed point number, or a number in scientific notation.
See strtod(3C).</p>

<p>3. If the metric has a string type, then value is
interpreted as a literal string of ASCII characters.</p>

<p>4. If the metric has any other type (i.e. PM_TYPE_EVENT
or PM_TYPE_AGGREGATE) then no encoding of value from the
command line makes sense, and the values of these metrics
cannot be modified with pmstore.</p>

<p>The output reports the old value and the new value for
each updated instance of the requested metric.</p>

<p>When using the -L option to fetch metrics from a local
context, the -K option may be used to control the DSO PMDAs
that should be made acces- sible. The spec argument conforms
to the syntax described in __pmSpecLocalPMDA(3). More than
one -K option may be used.</p>

<p>FILES $PCP_VAR_DIR/pmns/* default PMNS specification
files</p>

<p>PCP ENVIRONMENT Environment variables with the prefix
PCP_ are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP. On each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in pcp.conf(5).</p>

<p>SEE ALSO pmcd(1), pminfo(1), pmval(1),
__pmSpecLocalPMDA(3), strtod(3) and str- tol(3).</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS Two messages indicate a mismatch between the
internal data type for metricname and the value
provided.</p>

<p>The value &quot;???&quot; is out of range for the data
type (PM_TYPE_...)</p>

<p>The value &quot;???&quot; is incompatible with the data
type (PM_TYPE_...)</p>
