<p>NAME avahi.hosts - avahi-daemon static host name
file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS /etc/avahi/hosts</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION /etc/avahi/hosts is a file which may be used
to define static host name to IP address mappings for
multicast DNS. This is especially useful when publishing
DNS-SD services on behalf of other hosts. See
avahi.service(5) for more information.</p>

<p>The file format is similar to the one of /etc/hosts: on
each line an IP address and the corresponding host name. The
host names should be in FQDN form, i.e. with appended .local
suffix.</p>
