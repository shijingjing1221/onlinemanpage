<p>selabel_file(5) SELinux API documentation
selabel_file(5)</p>

<p>NAME selabel_file - userspace SELinux labeling
interface: file contexts backend.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;selinux/selinux.h&gt;</p>

<p>#include &lt;selinux/label.h&gt;</p>

<p>int selabel_lookup(struct selabel_handle *hnd,
security_context_t *context,</p>

<p>const char *path, int mode);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The file contexts backend maps from
pathname/mode combinations into security contexts. It is
used to find the appropriate context for each file when
relabeling a file system.</p>

<p>The path argument should be set to the full pathname of
the file whose assigned context is being checked. The mode
argument should be set to the mode bits of the file, as
determined by lstat(2).</p>

<p>OPTIONS In addition to the global options described in
selabel_open(3), this backend recognizes the following
options:</p>

<p>SELABEL_OPT_PATH A non-null value for this option
specifies a path to a file that will be opened in lieu of
the standard file contexts file. This value is also used as
the base name for determining the names of local
customization files.</p>

<p>SELABEL_OPT_BASEONLY A non-null value for this option
indicates that any local cus- tomizations to the file
contexts mapping should be ignored.</p>

<p>SELABEL_OPT_SUBSET A non-null value for this option is
interpreted as a path pre- fix, for example
&quot;/etc&quot;. Only file context specifications starting
with the given prefix are loaded. This may increase lookup
performance, however any attempt to look up a path not
starting with the given prefix will fail.</p>
