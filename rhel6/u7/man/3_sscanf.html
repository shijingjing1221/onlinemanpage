<p>NAME scanf, fscanf, sscanf, vscanf, vsscanf, vfscanf -
input format conver- sion</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</p>

<p>int scanf(const char *format, ...); int fscanf(FILE
*stream, const char *format, ...); int sscanf(const char
*str, const char *format, ...);</p>

<p>#include &lt;stdarg.h&gt;</p>

<p>int vscanf(const char *format, va_list ap); int
vsscanf(const char *str, const char *format, va_list ap);
int vfscanf(FILE *stream, const char *format, va_list
ap);</p>

<p>Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
feature_test_macros(7)):</p>

<p>vscanf(), vsscanf(), vfscanf(): _XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;= 600
|| _ISOC99_SOURCE; or cc -std=c99</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The scanf() family of functions scans input
according to format as described below. This format may
contain conversion specifications; the results from such
conversions, if any, are stored in the locations pointed to
by the pointer arguments that follow format. Each pointer
argument must be of a type that is appropriate for the value
returned by the corresponding conversion specification.</p>

<p>If the number of conversion specifications in format
exceeds the number of pointer arguments, the results are
undefined. If the number of pointer arguments exceeds the
number of conversion specifications, then the excess pointer
arguments are evaluated, but are otherwise ignored.</p>

<p>The scanf() function reads input from the standard input
stream stdin, fscanf() reads input from the stream pointer
stream, and sscanf() reads its input from the character
string pointed to by str.</p>

<p>The vfscanf() function is analogous to vfprintf(3) and
reads input from the stream pointer stream using a variable
argument list of pointers (see stdarg(3). The vscanf()
function scans a variable argument list from the standard
input and the vsscanf() function scans it from a string;
these are analogous to the vprintf(3) and vsprintf(3)
functions respectively.</p>

<p>The format string consists of a sequence of directives
which describe how to process the sequence of input
characters. If processing of a directive fails, no further
input is read, and scanf() returns. A &quot;failure&quot;
can be either of the following: input failure, meaning that
input characters were unavailable, or matching failure,
meaning that the input was inappropriate (see below).</p>

<p>A directive is one of the following:</p>

<p>&middot; A sequence of white-space characters (space,
tab, newline, etc.; see isspace(3)). This directive matches
any amount of white space, including none, in the input.</p>

<p>&middot; An ordinary character (i.e., one other than
white space or &rsquo;%&rsquo;). This character must exactly
match the next character of input.</p>

<p>&middot; A conversion specification, which commences
with a &rsquo;%&rsquo; (percent) character. A sequence of
characters from the input is converted according to this
specification, and the result is placed in the corresponding
pointer argument. If the next item of input does not match
the conversion specification, the conversion fails this is a
matching failure.</p>

<p>Each conversion specification in format begins with
either the charac- ter &rsquo;%&rsquo; or the character
sequence &quot;%n$&quot; (see below for the distinction)
followed by:</p>

<p>&middot; An optional &rsquo;*&rsquo;
assignment-suppression character: scanf() reads input as
directed by the conversion specification, but discards the
input. No corresponding pointer argument is required, and
this specification is not included in the count of
successful assignments returned by scanf().</p>

<p>&middot; An optional &rsquo;a&rsquo; character. This is
used with string conver- sions, and relieves the caller of
the need to allocate a corre- sponding buffer to hold the
input: instead, scanf() allocates a buffer of sufficient
size, and assigns the address of this buffer to the
corresponding pointer argument, which should be a pointer to
a char * variable (this variable does not need to be
initialized before the call). The caller should subsequently
free(3) this buffer when it is no longer required. This is a
GNU extension; C99 employs the &rsquo;a&rsquo; character as
a conversion specifier (and it can also be used as such in
the GNU implemen- tation).</p>

<p>&middot; An optional decimal integer which specifies the
maximum field width. Reading of characters stops either when
this maximum is reached or when a non-matching character is
found, whichever happens first. Most conversions discard
initial white space characters (the exceptions are noted
below), and these discarded characters dont count towards
the maximum field width. String input conversions store a
null terminator (&rsquo; &rsquo;) to mark the end of the
input; the maximum field width does not include this ter-
minator.</p>

<p>&middot; An optional type modifier character. For
example, the l type modifier is used with integer
conversions such as %d to specify that the corresponding
pointer argument refers to a long int rather than a pointer
to an int.</p>

<p>&middot; A conversion specifier that specifies the type
of input conver- sion to be performed.</p>

<p>The conversion specifications in format are of two
forms, either begin- ning with &rsquo;%&rsquo; or beginning
with &quot;%n$&quot;. The two forms should not be mixed in
the same format string, except that a string containing
&quot;%n$&quot; specifications can include %% and %*. If
format contains &rsquo;%&rsquo; specifi- cations then these
correspond in order with successive pointer argu- ments. In
the &quot;%n$&quot; form (which is specified in
POSIX.1-2001, but not C99), n is a decimal integer that
specifies that the converted input should be placed in the
location referred to by the n-th pointer argu- ment
following format.</p>

<p>Conversions The following type modifier characters can
appear in a conversion spec- ification:</p>

<p>h Indicates that the conversion will be one of d, i, o,
u, x, X, or n and the next pointer is a pointer to a short
int or unsigned short int (rather than int).</p>

<p>hh As for h, but the next pointer is a pointer to a
signed char or unsigned char.</p>

<p>j As for h, but the next pointer is a pointer to an
intmax_t or a uintmax_t. This modifier was introduced in
C99.</p>

<p>l Indicates either that the conversion will be one of d,
i, o, u, x, X, or n and the next pointer is a pointer to a
long int or unsigned long int (rather than int), or that the
conversion will be one of e, f, or g and the next pointer is
a pointer to double (rather than float). Specifying two l
characters is equivalent to L. If used with %c or %s the
corresponding parameter is con- sidered as a pointer to a
wide character or wide-character string respectively.</p>

<p>L Indicates that the conversion will be either e, f, or
g and the next pointer is a pointer to long double or the
conversion will be d, i, o, u, or x and the next pointer is
a pointer to long long.</p>

<p>q equivalent to L. This specifier does not exist in ANSI
C.</p>

<p>t As for h, but the next pointer is a pointer to a
ptrdiff_t. This modifier was introduced in C99.</p>

<p>z As for h, but the next pointer is a pointer to a
size_t. This modifier was introduced in C99.</p>

<p>The following conversion specifiers are available:</p>

<p>% Matches a literal &rsquo;%&rsquo;. That is, %% in the
format string matches a single input &rsquo;%&rsquo;
character. No conversion is done (but ini- tial white space
characters are discarded), and assignment does not
occur.</p>

<p>d Matches an optionally signed decimal integer; the next
pointer must be a pointer to int.</p>

<p>D Equivalent to ld; this exists only for backwards
compatibility. (Note: thus only in libc4. In libc5 and glibc
the %D is silently ignored, causing old programs to fail
mysteriously.)</p>

<p>i Matches an optionally signed integer; the next pointer
must be a pointer to int. The integer is read in base 16 if
it begins with 0x or 0X, in base 8 if it begins with 0, and
in base 10 otherwise. Only characters that correspond to the
base are used.</p>

<p>o Matches an unsigned octal integer; the next pointer
must be a pointer to unsigned int.</p>

<p>u Matches an unsigned decimal integer; the next pointer
must be a pointer to unsigned int.</p>

<p>x Matches an unsigned hexadecimal integer; the next
pointer must be a pointer to unsigned int.</p>

<p>X Equivalent to x.</p>

<p>f Matches an optionally signed floating-point number;
the next pointer must be a pointer to float.</p>

<p>e Equivalent to f.</p>

<p>g Equivalent to f.</p>

<p>E Equivalent to f.</p>

<p>a (C99) Equivalent to f.</p>

<p>s Matches a sequence of non-white-space characters; the
next pointer must be a pointer to character array that is
long enough to hold the input sequence and the terminating
null character (&rsquo; &rsquo;), which is added
automatically. The input string stops at white space or at
the maximum field width, whichever occurs first.</p>

<p>c Matches a sequence of characters whose length is
specified by the maximum field width (default 1); the next
pointer must be a pointer to char, and there must be enough
room for all the char- acters (no terminating null byte is
added). The usual skip of leading white space is suppressed.
To skip white space first, use an explicit space in the
format.</p>

<p>[ Matches a non-empty sequence of characters from the
specified set of accepted characters; the next pointer must
be a pointer to char, and there must be enough room for all
the characters in the string, plus a terminating null byte.
The usual skip of leading white space is suppressed. The
string is to be made up of characters in (or not in) a
particular set; the set is defined by the characters between
the open bracket [ character and a close bracket ]
character. The set excludes those charac- ters if the first
character after the open bracket is a circum- flex (^). To
include a close bracket in the set, make it the first
character after the open bracket or the circumflex; any
other position will end the set. The hyphen character - is
also special; when placed between two other characters, it
adds all intervening characters to the set. To include a
hyphen, make it the last character before the final close
bracket. For instance, [^]0-9-] means the set
&quot;everything except close bracket, zero through nine,
and hyphen&quot;. The string ends with the appearance of a
character not in the (or, with a circumflex, in) set or when
the field width runs out.</p>

<p>p Matches a pointer value (as printed by %p in
printf(3); the next pointer must be a pointer to a pointer
to void.</p>

<p>n Nothing is expected; instead, the number of characters
consumed thus far from the input is stored through the next
pointer, which must be a pointer to int. This is not a
conversion, although it can be suppressed with the *
assignment-suppression character. The C standard says:
&quot;Execution of a %n directive does not increment the
assignment count returned at the comple- tion of
execution&quot; but the Corrigendum seems to contradict
this. Probably it is wise not to make any assumptions on the
effect of %n conversions on the return value.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE These functions return the number of input
items successfully matched and assigned, which can be fewer
than provided for, or even zero in the event of an early
matching failure.</p>

<p>The value EOF is returned if the end of input is reached
before either the first successful conversion or a matching
failure occurs. EOF is also returned if a read error occurs,
in which case the error indicator for the stream (see
ferror(3)) is set, and errno is set indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS EAGAIN The file descriptor underlying stream is
marked non-blocking, and the read operation would block.</p>

<p>EBADF The file descriptor underlying stream is invalid,
or not open for reading.</p>

<p>EILSEQ Input byte sequence does not form a valid
character.</p>

<p>EINTR The read operation was interrupted by a signal;
see signal(7).</p>

<p>EINVAL Not enough arguments; or format is NULL.</p>

<p>ENOMEM Out of memory.</p>

<p>ERANGE The result of an integer conversion would exceed
the size that can be stored in the corresponding integer
type.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO The functions fscanf(), scanf(), and
sscanf() conform to C89 and C99 and POSIX.1-2001. These
standards do not specify the ERANGE error.</p>

<p>The q specifier is the 4.4BSD notation for long long,
while ll or the usage of L in integer conversions is the GNU
notation.</p>

<p>The Linux version of these functions is based on the GNU
libio library. Take a look at the info documentation of GNU
libc (glibc-1.08) for a more concise description.</p>

<p>NOTES The GNU C library supports a non-standard
extension that causes the library to dynamically allocate a
string of sufficient size for input strings for the %s and
%a[range] conversion specifiers. To make use of this
feature, specify a as a length modifier (thus %as or
%a[range]). The caller must free(3) the returned string, as
in the following exam- ple:</p>

<p>char *p; int n;</p>

<p>errno = 0; n = scanf(&quot;%a[a-z]&quot;, &amp;p); if (n
== 1) { printf(&quot;read: %s0, p); free(p); } else if
(errno != 0) { perror(&quot;scanf&quot;); } else {
fprintf(stderr, &quot;No matching characters0): }</p>

<p>As shown in the above example, it is only necessary to
call free(3) if the scanf() call successfully read a
string.</p>

<p>The a modifier is not available if the program is
compiled with gcc -std=c99 or gcc -D_ISOC99_SOURCE (unless
_GNU_SOURCE is also speci- fied), in which case the a is
interpreted as a specifier for floating- point numbers (see
above).</p>

<p>Since version 2.7, glibc also provides the m modifier
for the same pur- pose as the a modifier. The m modifier has
the following advantages:</p>

<p>* It may also be applied to %c conversion specifiers
(e.g., %3mc).</p>

<p>* It avoids ambiguity with respect to the %a
floating-point conversion specifier (and is unaffected by
gcc -std=c99 etc.)</p>

<p>* It is specified in the upcoming revision of the
POSIX.1 standard.</p>

<p>BUGS All functions are fully C89 conformant, but provide
the additional specifiers q and a as well as an additional
behavior of the L and l specifiers. The latter may be
considered to be a bug, as it changes the behavior of
specifiers defined in C89.</p>

<p>Some combinations of the type modifiers and conversion
specifiers defined by ANSI C do not make sense (e.g. %Ld).
While they may have a well-defined behavior on Linux, this
need not to be so on other archi- tectures. Therefore it
usually is better to use modifiers that are not defined by
ANSI C at all, that is, use q instead of L in combination
with d, i, o, u, x, and X conversions or ll.</p>

<p>The usage of q is not the same as on 4.4BSD, as it may
be used in float conversions equivalently to L.</p>
