<p>XDG-MIME(1) XDG-MIME(1)</p>

<p>NAME xdg-mime - command line tool for querying
information about file type handling and adding descriptions
for new file types</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS xdg-mime query {filetype default} ...</p>

<p>xdg-mime default application mimetype(s)</p>

<p>xdg-mime install [--mode mode] [--novendor]
mimetypes-file</p>

<p>xdg-mime uninstall [--mode mode] mimetypes-file</p>

<p>xdg-mime {--help --manual --version}</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The xdg-mime program can be used to query
information about file types and to add descriptions for new
file types.</p>

<p>COMMANDS query Returns information related to file
types.</p>

<p>The query option is for use inside a desktop session
only. It is not recommended to use xdg-mime query as
root.</p>

<p>The following queries are supported:</p>

<p>query filetype FILE: Returns the file type of FILE in
the form of a MIME type.</p>

<p>query default mimetype: Returns the default application
that the desktop environment uses for opening files of type
mimetype. The default application is identified by its
*.desktop file.</p>

<p>default Ask the desktop environment to make application
the default application for opening files of type mimetype.
An application can be made the default for several file
types by specifying multiple mimetypes.</p>

<p>application is the desktop file id of the application
and has the form vendor-name.desktop application must
already be installed in the desktop menu before it can be
made the default handler. The aplications desktop file must
list support for all the MIME types that it wishes to be the
default handler for.</p>

<p>Requests to make an application a default handler may be
subject to system policy or approval by the end-user.
xdg-mime query can be used to verify whether an application
is the actual default handler for a specific file type.</p>

<p>The default option is for use inside a desktop session
only. It is not recommended to use xdg-mime default as
root.</p>

<p>install Adds the file type descriptions provided in
mimetypes-file to the desktop environment. mimetypes-file
must be a XML file that follows the freedesktop.org Shared
MIME-info Database specification and that has a mime-info
element as its document root. For each new file type one or
more icons with name major-minor must be installed with the
xdg-icon-resource command in the mimetypes context. For
example the application/vnd.oasis.opendocument.text filetype
requires an icon by the name of
application-vnd.oasis.opendocument.text to be installed.</p>

<p>uninstall Removes the file type descriptions provided in
mimetypes-file and previously added with xdg-mime install
from the desktop environment. mimetypes-file must be a XML
file that follows the freedesktop.org Shared MIME-info
Database specification and that has a mime-info element as
its document root.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --mode mode mode can be user or system. In user
mode the file is (un)installed for the current user only. In
system mode the file is (un)installed for all users on the
system. Usually only root is allowed to install in system
mode.</p>

<p>The default is to use system mode when called by root
and to use user mode when called by a non-root user.</p>

<p>--novendor Normally, xdg-mime checks to ensure that the
mimetypes-file to be installed has a proper vendor prefix.
This option can be used to disable that check.</p>

<p>A vendor prefix consists of alpha characters ([a-zA-Z])
and is terminated with a dash (&quot;-&quot;). Companies and
organizations are encouraged to use a word or phrase,
preferably the organizations name, for which they hold a
trademark as their vendor prefix. The purpose of the vendor
prefix is to prevent name conflicts.</p>

<p>--help Show command synopsis.</p>

<p>--manual Show this manualpage.</p>

<p>--version Show the xdg-utils version information.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES xdg-mime honours the following
environment variables:</p>

<p>XDG_UTILS_DEBUG_LEVEL Setting this environment variable
to a non-zero numerical value makes xdg-mime do more verbose
reporting on stderr. Setting a higher value increases the
verbosity.</p>

<p>XDG_UTILS_INSTALL_MODE This environment variable can be
used by the user or administrator to override the
installation mode. Valid values are user and system.</p>

<p>EXIT CODES An exit code of 0 indicates success while a
non-zero exit code indicates failure. The following failure
codes can be returned:</p>

<p>1 Error in command line syntax.</p>

<p>2 One of the files passed on the command line did not
exist.</p>

<p>3 A required tool could not be found.</p>

<p>4 The action failed.</p>

<p>5 No permission to read one of the files passed on the
command line.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO xdg-icon-resource(1), xdg-desktop-menu(1)</p>

<p>EXAMPLES xdg-mime query filetype /tmp/foobar.png</p>

<p>Prints the MIME type of the file /tmp/foobar.png, in
this case image/png</p>

<p>xdg-mime query default image/png</p>

<p>Prints the .desktop filename of the application which is
registered to open PNG files.</p>

<p>xdg-mime install shinythings-shiny.xml</p>

<p>Adds a file type description for
&quot;shiny&quot;-files. &quot;shinythings-&quot; is used as
the vendor prefix. The file type description could look as
folows.</p>

<p>shinythings-shiny.xml:</p>

<p>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt; &lt;mime-info
xmlns=
http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/shared-mime-info&gt;
&lt;mime-type type=&quot;text/x-shiny&quot;&gt;
&lt;comment&gt;Shiny new file type&lt;/comment&gt; &lt;glob
pattern=&quot;*.shiny&quot;/&gt; &lt;glob
pattern=&quot;*.shi&quot;/&gt; &lt;/mime-type&gt;
&lt;/mime-info&gt;</p>

<p>An icon for this new file type must also be installed,
for example with:</p>

<p>xdg-icon-resource install --context mimetypes --size 64
shiny-file-icon.png text-x-shiny</p>
