<p>COLCRT(1) BSD General Commands Manual COLCRT(1)</p>

<p>NAME colcrt - filter nroff output for CRT previewing</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS colcrt [-] [-2] [file ...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Colcrt provides virtual half-line and
reverse line feed sequences for terminals without such
capability, and on which overstriking is destruc- tive.
Half-line characters and underlining (changed to dashing -)
are placed on new lines in between the normal output
lines.</p>

<p>Available options:</p>

<p>- Suppress all underlining. This option is especially
useful for previewing allboxed tables from tbl(1).</p>

<p>-2 Causes all half-lines to be printed, effectively
double spacing the output. Normally, a minimal space output
format is used which will suppress empty lines. The program
never suppresses two consecutive empty lines, however. The
-2 option is useful for sending output to the line printer
when the output contains superscripts and subscripts which
would otherwise be invisible.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES A typical use of colcrt would be</p>

<p>tbl exum2.n | nroff -ms | colcrt - | more</p>

<p>SEE ALSO nroff(1), troff(1), col(1), more(1), ul(1)</p>

<p>BUGS Should fold underlines onto blanks even with the -
option so that a true underline character would show.</p>

<p>Cant back up more than 102 lines.</p>

<p>General overstriking is lost; as a special case |
overstruck with - or underline becomes +.</p>

<p>Lines are trimmed to 132 characters.</p>

<p>Some provision should be made for processing
superscripts and subscripts in documents which are already
double-spaced.</p>

<p>HISTORY The colcrt command appeared in 3.0BSD.</p>

<p>AVAILABILITY The colcrt command is part of the
util-linux-ng package and is available from
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux-ng/.</p>
