<p>PTHREAD_MUTEXATTR_DESTROY(3POSIX Programmer s
ManPTHREAD_MUTEXATTR_DESTROY(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME pthread_mutexattr_destroy, pthread_mutexattr_init -
destroy and ini- tialize the mutex attributes object</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;</p>

<p>int pthread_mutexattr_destroy(pthread_mutexattr_t
*attr); int pthread_mutexattr_init(pthread_mutexattr_t
*attr);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pthread_mutexattr_destroy() function
shall destroy a mutex attributes object; the object becomes,
in effect, uninitialized. An implementation may cause
pthread_mutexattr_destroy() to set the object referenced by
attr to an invalid value. A destroyed attr attributes object
can be reinitialized using pthread_mutexattr_init(); the
results of otherwise referencing the object after it has
been destroyed are undefined.</p>

<p>The pthread_mutexattr_init() function shall initialize a
mutex attributes object attr with the default value for all
of the attributes defined by the implementation.</p>

<p>Results are undefined if pthread_mutexattr_init() is
called specifying an already initialized attr attributes
object.</p>

<p>After a mutex attributes object has been used to
initialize one or more mutexes, any function affecting the
attributes object (including destruction) shall not affect
any previously initialized mutexes.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion,
pthread_mutexattr_destroy() and pthread_mutexattr_init()
shall return zero; otherwise, an error number shall be
returned to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The pthread_mutexattr_destroy() function may fail
if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The value specified by attr is invalid.</p>

<p>The pthread_mutexattr_init() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>ENOMEM Insufficient memory exists to initialize the
mutex attributes object.</p>

<p>These functions shall not return an error code of
[EINTR].</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE See pthread_attr_init() for a general
explanation of attributes. Attributes objects allow
implementations to experiment with useful extensions and
permit extension of this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001
without changing the existing functions. Thus, they provide
for future extensibility of this volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001 and reduce the temptation to standardize
prematurely on semantics that are not yet widely implemented
or understood.</p>

<p>Examples of possible additional mutex attributes that
have been dis- cussed are spin_only, limited_spin, no_spin,
recursive, and metered. (To explain what the latter
attributes might mean: recursive mutexes would allow for
multiple re-locking by the current owner; metered mutexes
would transparently keep records of queue length, wait time,
and so on.) Since there is not yet wide agreement on the
usefulness of these resulting from shared implementation and
usage experience, they are not yet specified in this volume
of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001. Mutex attributes objects, however,
make it possible to test out these con- cepts for possible
standardization at a later time.</p>

<p>Mutex Attributes and Performance Care has been taken to
ensure that the default values of the mutex attributes have
been defined such that mutexes initialized with the defaults
have simple enough semantics so that the locking and
unlocking can be done with the equivalent of a test-and-set
instruction (plus possibly a few other basic
instructions).</p>

<p>There is at least one implementation method that can be
used to reduce the cost of testing at lock-time if a mutex
has non-default attributes. One such method that an
implementation can employ (and this can be made fully
transparent to fully conforming POSIX applications) is to
secretly pre-lock any mutexes that are initialized to
non-default attributes. Any later attempt to lock such a
mutex causes the implemen- tation to branch to the
&quot;slow path&quot; as if the mutex were unavailable;
then, on the slow path, the implementation can do the
&quot;real work&quot; to lock a non-default mutex. The
underlying unlock operation is more com- plicated since the
implementation never really wants to release the pre-lock on
this kind of mutex. This illustrates that, depending on the
hardware, there may be certain optimizations that can be
used so that whatever mutex attributes are considered
&quot;most frequently used&quot; can be processed most
efficiently.</p>

<p>Process Shared Memory and Synchronization The existence
of memory mapping functions in this volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001 leads to the possibility that an application may
allocate the synchronization objects from this section in
memory that is accessed by multiple processes (and
therefore, by threads of multi- ple processes).</p>

<p>In order to permit such usage, while at the same time
keeping the usual case (that is, usage within a single
process) efficient, a process- shared option has been
defined.</p>

<p>If an implementation supports the
_POSIX_THREAD_PROCESS_SHARED option, then the process-shared
attribute can be used to indicate that mutexes or condition
variables may be accessed by threads of multiple pro-
cesses.</p>

<p>The default setting of PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE has been
chosen for the process-shared attribute so that the most
efficient forms of these syn- chronization objects are
created by default.</p>

<p>Synchronization variables that are initialized with the
PTHREAD_PRO- CESS_PRIVATE process-shared attribute may only
be operated on by threads in the process that initialized
them. Synchronization variables that are initialized with
the PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED process-shared attribute may be
operated on by any thread in any process that has access to
it. In particular, these processes may exist beyond the
lifetime of the initializing process. For example, the
following code implements a simple counting semaphore in a
mapped file that may be used by many processes.</p>

<p>/* sem.h */ struct semaphore { pthread_mutex_t lock;
pthread_cond_t nonzero; unsigned count; }; typedef struct
semaphore semaphore_t;</p>

<p>semaphore_t *semaphore_create(char *semaphore_name);
semaphore_t *semaphore_open(char *semaphore_name); void
semaphore_post(semaphore_t *semap); void
semaphore_wait(semaphore_t *semap); void
semaphore_close(semaphore_t *semap);</p>

&lt;fcntl.h&gt; #include &lt;pthread.h&gt; #include
&quot;sem.h&quot;</p>

<p>semaphore_t * semaphore_create(char *semaphore_name) {
int fd; semaphore_t *semap; pthread_mutexattr_t psharedm;
pthread_condattr_t psharedc;</p>

<p>fd = open(semaphore_name, O_RDWR | O_CREAT | O_EXCL,
0666); if (fd &lt; 0) return (NULL); (void) ftruncate(fd,
sizeof(semaphore_t)); (void)
pthread_mutexattr_init(&amp;psharedm); (void)
pthread_mutexattr_setpshared(&amp;psharedm,
PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED); (void)
pthread_condattr_init(&amp;psharedc); (void)
pthread_condattr_setpshared(&amp;psharedc,
PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED); semap = (semaphore_t *) mmap(NULL,
sizeof(semaphore_t), PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, fd,
0); close (fd); (void)
pthread_mutex_init(&amp;semap-&gt;lock, &amp;psharedm);
(void) pthread_cond_init(&amp;semap-&gt;nonzero,
&amp;psharedc); semap-&gt;count = 0; return (semap); }</p>

<p>semaphore_t * semaphore_open(char *semaphore_name) { int
fd; semaphore_t *semap;</p>

<p>fd = open(semaphore_name, O_RDWR, 0666); if (fd &lt; 0)
return (NULL); semap = (semaphore_t *) mmap(NULL,
sizeof(semaphore_t), PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, fd,
0); close (fd); return (semap); }</p>

<p>void semaphore_post(semaphore_t *semap) {
pthread_mutex_lock(&amp;semap-&gt;lock); if (semap-&gt;count
== 0) pthread_cond_signal(&amp;semapx-&gt;nonzero);
semap-&gt;count++;
pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;semap-&gt;lock); }</p>

<p>void semaphore_wait(semaphore_t *semap) {
pthread_mutex_lock(&amp;semap-&gt;lock); while
(semap-&gt;count == 0)
pthread_cond_wait(&amp;semap-&gt;nonzero,
&amp;semap-&gt;lock); semap-&gt;count--;
pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;semap-&gt;lock); }</p>

<p>void semaphore_close(semaphore_t *semap) { munmap((void
*) semap, sizeof(semaphore_t)); }</p>

<p>The following code is for three separate processes that
create, post, and wait on a semaphore in the file
/tmp/semaphore. Once the file is created, the post and wait
programs increment and decrement the count- ing semaphore
(waiting and waking as required) even though they did not
initialize the semaphore.</p>

<p>/* create.c */ #include &quot;pthread.h&quot; #include
&quot;sem.h&quot;</p>

<p>int main() { semaphore_t *semap;</p>

<p>semap = semaphore_create(&quot;/tmp/semaphore&quot;); if
(semap == NULL) exit(1); semaphore_close(semap); return (0);
}</p>

<p>/* post */ #include &quot;pthread.h&quot; #include
&quot;sem.h&quot;</p>

<p>int main() { semaphore_t *semap;</p>

<p>semap = semaphore_open(&quot;/tmp/semaphore&quot;); if
(semap == NULL) exit(1); semaphore_post(semap);
semaphore_close(semap); return (0); }</p>

<p>/* wait */ #include &quot;pthread.h&quot; #include
&quot;sem.h&quot;</p>

<p>int main() { semaphore_t *semap;</p>

<p>semap = semaphore_open(&quot;/tmp/semaphore&quot;); if
(semap == NULL) exit(1); semaphore_wait(semap);
semaphore_close(semap); return (0); }</p>
