<p>log4cpp::Filter(3) log4cpp log4cpp::Filter(3)</p>

<p>NAME log4cpp::Filter -</p>

<p>Users should extend this class to implement customized
logging event filtering.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;Filter.hh&gt;</p>

<p>Public Types enum Decision { DENY = -1, NEUTRAL = 0,
ACCEPT = 1 }</p>

<p>Public Member Functions Filter () Default Constructor
for Filter. virtual ~Filter () Destructor for Filter.
virtual void setChainedFilter (Filter *filter) Set the next
Filter in the Filter chain. virtual Filter *
getChainedFilter () Get the next Filter in the Filter chain.
virtual Filter * getEndOfChain () Get the last Filter in the
Filter chain. virtual void appendChainedFilter (Filter
*filter) Add a Filter to the end of the Filter chain.
virtual Decision decide (const LoggingEvent &amp;event)
Decide whether to accept or deny a LoggingEvent.</p>

<p>Protected Member Functions virtual Decision _decide
(const LoggingEvent &amp;event)=0 Decide whether this Filter
accepts or denies the given LoggingEvent.</p>

<p>Detailed Description Users should extend this class to
implement customized logging event filtering.</p>

<p>Note that log4cpp::Category and lof4cpp::Appender have
built-in filtering rules. It is suggested that you first use
and understand the built-in rules before rushing to write
your own custom filters.</p>

<p>This abstract class assumes and also imposes that
filters be organized in a linear chain. The
decide(LoggingEvent) method of each filter is called
sequentially, in the order of their addition to the
chain.</p>

<p>The decide(LoggingEvent) method must return a Decision
value, either DENY, NEUTRAL or ACCCEPT.</p>

<p>If the value DENY is returned, then the log event is
dropped immediately without consulting with the remaining
filters.</p>

<p>If the value NEUTRAL is returned, then the next filter
in the chain is consulted. If there are no more filters in
the chain, then the log event is logged. Thus, in the
presence of no filters, the default behaviour is to log all
logging events.</p>

<p>If the value ACCEPT is returned, then the log event is
logged without consulting the remaining filters.</p>

<p>The philosophy of log4cpp filters is largely inspired
from the Linux ipchains.</p>

<p>Member Enumeration Documentation enum

<p>DENY</p>

<p>NEUTRAL</p>

<p>ACCEPT</p>

<p>Constructor &amp; Destructor Documentation
log4cpp::Filter::Filter () Default Constructor for
Filter.</p>

<p>log4cpp::Filter::~Filter () [virtual] Destructor for
Filter.</p>

<p>Member Function Documentation virtual Decision
log4cpp::Filter::_decide (const LoggingEvent &amp; event)
[protected, pure virtual] Decide whether this Filter accepts
or denies the given LoggingEvent. Actual implementation of
Filter should override this method and not
decide(LoggingEvent&amp;).</p>

<p>Parameters: event The LoggingEvent to decide on.</p>

<p>Returns: The Decision</p>

<p>void log4cpp::Filter::appendChainedFilter (Filter *
filter) [virtual] Add a Filter to the end of the Filter
chain. Convience method for
getEndOfChain()-&gt;setChainedFilter(filter).</p>

<p>Parameters: filter The filter to add to the end of the
chain.</p>

<p>Filter::Decision log4cpp::Filter::decide (const
LoggingEvent &amp; event) [virtual] Decide whether to accept
or deny a LoggingEvent. This method will walk the entire
chain until a non neutral decision has been made or the end
of the chain has been reached.</p>

<p>Parameters: event The LoggingEvent to decide on.</p>

<p>Returns: The Decision</p>

<p>Filter * log4cpp::Filter::getChainedFilter () [virtual]
Get the next Filter in the Filter chain. Returns: The next
Filter or NULL if the current filter is the last in the
chain</p>

<p>Filter * log4cpp::Filter::getEndOfChain () [virtual] Get
the last Filter in the Filter chain. Returns: The last
Filter in the Filter chain</p>

<p>void log4cpp::Filter::setChainedFilter (Filter * filter)
[virtual] Set the next Filter in the Filter chain.
Parameters: filter The filter to chain</p>
