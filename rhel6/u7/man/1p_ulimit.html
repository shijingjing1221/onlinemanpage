<p>ULIMIT(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual ULIMIT(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME ulimit - set or report file size limit</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ulimit [-f][blocks]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The ulimit utility shall set or report the
file-size writing limit imposed on files written by the
shell and its child processes (files of any size may be
read). Only a process with appropriate privileges can
increase the limit.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The ulimit utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>The following option shall be supported:</p>

<p>-f Set (or report, if no blocks operand is present), the
file size limit in blocks. The -f option shall also be the
default case.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p>blocks The number of 512-byte blocks to use as the new
file size limit.</p>

<p>STDIN Not used.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of ulimit:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in
arguments).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT The standard output shall be used when no blocks
operand is present. If the current number of blocks is
limited, the number of blocks in the current limit shall be
written in the following format:</p>

<p>&quot;%n&quot;, &lt;number of 512-byte blocks&gt;</p>

<p>If there is no current limit on the number of blocks, in
the POSIX locale the following format shall be used:</p>

<p>&quot;unlimiten&quot;</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 Successful completion.</p>

<p>&gt;0 A request for a higher limit was rejected or an
error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE Since ulimit affects the current shell
execution environment, it is always provided as a shell
regular built-in. If it is called in a sepa- rate utility
execution environment, such as one of the following:</p>

<p>nohup ulimit -f 10000 env ulimit 10000</p>

<p>it does not affect the file size limit of the caller s
environment.</p>

<p>Once a limit has been decreased by a process, it cannot
be increased (unless appropriate privileges are involved),
even back to the original system limit.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Set the file size limit to 51200 bytes:</p>

<p>ulimit -f 100</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
