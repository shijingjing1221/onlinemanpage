<p>NAME termio - the System V terminal driver interface</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION termio is the name of the old System V
terminal driver interface. This interface defined a termio
structure used to store terminal settings, and a range of
ioctl(2) operations to get and set terminal attributes.</p>

<p>The termio interface is now obsolete: POSIX.1-1990
standardized a modi- fied version of this interface, under
the name termios. The POSIX.1 data structure differs
slightly from the System V version, and POSIX.1 defined a
suite of functions to replace the various ioctl(2)
operations that existed in System V. (This was done because
ioctl(2) was unstan- dardized, and its variadic third
argument does not allow argument type checking.)</p>

<p>If you re looking for page called &quot;termio&quot;,
then you can probably find most of the information that you
seek in either termios(3) or tty_ioctl(4).</p>
