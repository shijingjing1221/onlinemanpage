<p>MYSQLBUG(1) MySQL Database System MYSQLBUG(1)</p>

<p>NAME mysqlbug - generate bug report</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS mysqlbug</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program enables you to generate a bug
report and send it to Oracle Corporation. It is a shell
script and runs on Unix.</p>

<p>The normal way to report bugs is to visit
http://bugs.mysql.com/, which is the address for our bugs
database. This database is public and can be browsed and
searched by anyone. If you log in to the system, you can
enter new reports. If you have no Web access, you can
generate a bug report by using the mysqlbug script.</p>

<p>mysqlbug helps you generate a report by determining much
of the following information automatically, but if something
important is missing, please include it with your message.
mysqlbug can be found in the scripts directory (source
distribution) and in the bin directory under your MySQL
installation directory (binary distribution).</p>

<p>Invoke mysqlbug without arguments:</p>

<p>shell&gt; mysqlbug</p>

<p>The script will place you in an editor with a copy of
the report to be sent. Edit the lines near the beginning
that indicate the nature of the problem. Then write the file
to save your changes, quit the editor, and mysqlbug will
send the report by email.</p>
