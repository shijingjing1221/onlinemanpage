<p>NAME Tk_GetVRootGeometry - Get location and size of
virtual root for window</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tk.h&gt;</p>

<p>Tk_GetVRootGeometry(tkwin, xPtr, yPtr, widthPtr,
heightPtr)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS Tk_Window tkwin (in) Token for window whose
virtual root is to be queried.</p>

<p>int xPtr (out) Points to word in which to store x-
offset of virtual root.</p>

<p>int yPtr (out) Points to word in which to store y-
offset of virtual root.</p>

<p>int widthPtr (out) Points to word in which to store
width of virtual root.</p>

<p>int heightPtr (out) Points to word in which to store
height of virtual root.

<p>DESCRIPTION Tk_GetVRootGeometry returns geometry
information about the virtual root window associated with
tkwin. The associated virtual root is the one in which tkwin
s nearest top-level ancestor (or tkwin itself if it is a
top-level window) has been reparented by the window manager.
This win- dow is identified by a __SWM_ROOT or __WM_ROOT
property placed on the top-level window by the window
manager. If tkwin is not associated with a virtual root
(e.g. because the window manager does not use vir- tual
roots) then *xPtr and *yPtr will be set to 0 and *widthPtr
and *heightPtr will be set to the dimensions of the screen
containing tkwin.</p>
