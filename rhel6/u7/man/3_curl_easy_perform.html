<p>curl_easy_perform(3) libcurl Manual
curl_easy_perform(3)</p>

<p>NAME curl_easy_perform - Perform a file transfer</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;curl/curl.h&gt;</p>

<p>CURLcode curl_easy_perform(CURL *handle);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This function is called after the init and
all the curl_easy_setopt(3) calls are made, and will perform
the transfer as described in the options. It must be called
with the same handle as input as the curl_easy_init call
returned.</p>

<p>You can do any amount of calls to curl_easy_perform(3)
while using the same handle. If you intend to transfer more
than one file, you are even encouraged to do so. libcurl
will then attempt to re-use the same con- nection for the
following transfers, thus making the operations faster, less
CPU intense and using less network resources. Just note that
you will have to use curl_easy_setopt(3) between the invokes
to set options for the following curl_easy_perform.</p>

<p>You must never call this function simultaneously from
two places using the same handle. Let the function return
first before invoking it another time. If you want parallel
transfers, you must use several curl handles.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE 0 means everything was ok, non-zero means
an error occurred as &lt;curl/curl.h&gt; defines. If the
CURLOPT_ERRORBUFFER was set with curl_easy_setopt there will
be a readable error message in the error buffer when
non-zero is returned.</p>
