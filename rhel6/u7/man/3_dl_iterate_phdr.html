<p>DL_ITERATE_PHDR(3) Linux Programmer s Manual
DL_ITERATE_PHDR(3)</p>

<p>NAME dl_iterate_phdr - walk through list of shared
objects</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #define _GNU_SOURCE #include &lt;link.h&gt;</p>

<p>int dl_iterate_phdr( int (*callback) (struct
dl_phdr_info *info, size_t size, void *data), void
*data);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The dl_iterate_phdr() function allows an
application to inquire at run time to find out which shared
objects it has loaded.</p>

<p>The dl_iterate_phdr() function walks through the list of
an applica- tions shared objects and calls the function
callback once for each object, until either all shared
objects have been processed or callback returns a non-zero
value.</p>

<p>Each call to callback receives three arguments: info,
which is a pointer to a structure containing information
about the shared object; size, which is the size of the
structure pointed to by info; and data, which is a copy of
whatever value was passed by the calling program as the
second argument (also named data) in the call to
dl_iterate_phdr().</p>

<p>The info argument is a structure of the following
type:</p>

<p>struct dl_phdr_info { ElfW(Addr) dlpi_addr; /* Base
address of object */ const char *dlpi_name; /*
(Null-terminated) name of object */ const ElfW(Phdr)
*dlpi_phdr; /* Pointer to array of ELF program headers for
this object */ ElfW(Half) dlpi_phnum; /* # of items in
dlpi_phdr */ };</p>

<p>(The ElfW() macro definition turns its argument into the
name of an ELF data type suitable for the hardware
architecture. For example, on a 32-bit platform, ElfW(Addr)
yields the data type name Elf32_Addr. Fur- ther information
on these types can be found in the &lt;elf.h&gt; and
&lt;link.h&gt; header files.)</p>

<p>The dlpi_addr field indicates the base address of the
shared object (i.e., the difference between the virtual
memory address of the shared object and the offset of that
object in the file from which it was loaded). The dlpi_name
field is a null-terminated string giving the pathname from
which the shared object was loaded.</p>

<p>To understand the meaning of the dlpi_phdr and
dlpi_phnum fields, we need to be aware that an ELF shared
object consists of a number of seg- ments, each of which has
a corresponding program header describing the segment. The
dlpi_phdr field is a pointer to an array of the program
headers for this shared object. The dlpi_phnum field
indicates the size of this array.</p>

<p>These program headers are structures of the following
form:</p>

<p>typedef struct { Elf32_Word p_type; /* Segment type */
Elf32_Off p_offset; /* Segment file offset */ Elf32_Addr
p_vaddr; /* Segment virtual address */ Elf32_Addr p_paddr;
/* Segment physical address */ Elf32_Word p_filesz; /*
Segment size in file */ Elf32_Word p_memsz; /* Segment size
in memory */ Elf32_Word p_flags; /* Segment flags */
Elf32_Word p_align; /* Segment alignment */ }
Elf32_Phdr;</p>

<p>Note that we can calculate the location of a particular
program header, x, in virtual memory using the formula:</p>

<p>addr == info-&gt;dlpi_addr +
info-&gt;dlpi_phdr[x].p_vaddr;</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The dl_iterate_phdr() function returns
whatever value was returned by the last call to
callback.</p>

<p>VERSIONS dl_iterate_phdr() has been supported in glibc
since version 2.2.4.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO The dl_iterate_phdr() function is
Linux-specific and should be avoided in portable
applications.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE The following program displays a list of
pathnames of the shared objects it has loaded. For each
shared object, the program lists the virtual addresses at
which the objects ELF segments are loaded.</p>

<p>#define _GNU_SOURCE #include &lt;link.h&gt; #include
&lt;stdlib.h&gt; #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</p>

<p>static int callback(struct dl_phdr_info *info, size_t
size, void *data) { int j;</p>

<p>printf(&quot;name=%s (%d segments)0, info-&gt;dlpi_name,
info-&gt;dlpi_phnum);</p>

<p>for (j = 0; j &lt; info-&gt;dlpi_phnum; j++)
printf(&quot; header %2d: address=%10p0, j, (void *)
(info-&gt;dlpi_addr + info-&gt;dlpi_phdr[j].p_vaddr));
return 0; }</p>

<p>int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
dl_iterate_phdr(callback, NULL);</p>

<p>exit(EXIT_SUCCESS); }</p>
