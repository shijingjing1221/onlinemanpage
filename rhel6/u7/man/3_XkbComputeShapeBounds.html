<p>XkbComputeShapeBounds(3) XKB FUNCTIONS
XkbComputeShapeBounds(3)</p>

<p>NAME XkbComputeShapeBounds - Updates the bounding box of
a shape</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS Bool XkbComputeShapeBounds (XkbShapePtr
shape);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS - shape shape to be examined</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Xkb provides a number of convenience
functions to help use a keyboard geometry. These include
functions to return the bounding box of a shape s top
surface and to update the bounding box of a shape row or
section.</p>

<p>A shape is made up of a number of outlines. Each outline
is a polygon made up of a number of points. The bounding box
of a shape is a rectan- gle that contains all the outlines
of that shape.</p>

<p>A ShapeRec contains a BoundsRec that describes the
bounds of the shape. If you add or delete an outline to or
from a shape, the bounding box must be updated.</p>

<p>XkbComputeShapeBounds updates the BoundsRec contained in
the shape by examining all the outlines of the shape and
setting the BoundsRec to the minimum x and minimum y, and
maximum x and maximum y values found in those outlines.
XkbComputeShapeBounds returns False if shape is NULL or if
there are no outlines for the shape; otherwise, it returns
True.</p>

<p>If you add or delete a key to or from a row, or if you
update the shape of one of the keys in that row, you may
need to update the bounding box of that row. To update the
bounding box of a row, use XkbComputeRow- Bounds.</p>

<p>STRUCTURES typedef struct _XkbShape { Atom name; /
shapes name */ unsigned short num_outlines; / number of
outlines for the shape */ unsigned short sz_outlines; / size
of the outlines array */ XkbOutlinePtr outlines; / array of
outlines for the shape */ XkbOutlinePtr approx; / pointer
into the array to the approximating outline */ XkbOutlinePtr
primary; / pointer into the array to the primary outline */
XkbBoundsRec bounds; / bounding box for the shape;
encompasses all outlines */ } XkbShapeRec, *XkbShapePtr;</p>

<p>typedef struct _XkbBounds { short x1,y1; / upper left
corner of the bounds, in mm/10 */ short x2,y2; / lower right
corner of the bounds, in mm/10 */ } XkbBoundsRec,
*XkbBoundsPtr;</p>
