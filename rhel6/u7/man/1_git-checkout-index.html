<p>GIT-CHECKOUT-INDEX(1) Git Manual
GIT-CHECKOUT-INDEX(1)</p>

<p>NAME git-checkout-index - Copy files from the index to
the working tree</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS git checkout-index [-u] [-q] [-a] [-f] [-n]
[--prefix=&lt;string&gt;] [--stage=&lt;number&gt;|all]
[--temp] [-z] [--stdin] [--] [&lt;file&gt;]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Will copy all files listed from the index to
the working directory (not overwriting existing files).</p>

<p>OPTIONS -u, --index update stat information for the
checked out entries in the index file.</p>

<p>-q, --quiet be quiet if files exist or are not in the
index</p>

<p>-f, --force forces overwrite of existing files</p>

<p>-a, --all checks out all files in the index. Cannot be
used together with explicit filenames.</p>

<p>-n, --no-create Don t checkout new files, only refresh
files already checked out.</p>

<p>--prefix=&lt;string&gt; When creating files, prepend
&lt;string&gt; (usually a directory including a trailing
/)</p>

<p>--stage=&lt;number&gt;|all Instead of checking out
unmerged entries, copy out the files from named stage.
&lt;number&gt; must be between 1 and 3. Note: --stage=all
automatically implies --temp.</p>

<p>--temp Instead of copying the files to the working
directory write the content to temporary files. The
temporary name associations will be written to stdout.</p>

<p>--stdin Instead of taking list of paths from the command
line, read list of paths from the standard input. Paths are
separated by LF (i.e. one path per line) by default.</p>

<p>-z Only meaningful with --stdin; paths are separated
with NUL character instead of LF.</p>

<p>-- Do not interpret any more arguments as options.</p>

<p>The order of the flags used to matter, but not
anymore.</p>

<p>Just doing git checkout-index does nothing. You probably
meant git checkout-index -a. And if you want to force it,
you want git checkout-index -f -a.</p>

<p>Intuitiveness is not the goal here. Repeatability is.
The reason for the &quot;no arguments means no work&quot;
behavior is that from scripts you are supposed to be able to
do:</p>

<p>$ find . -name &acute;*.h&acute; -print0 | xargs -0 git
checkout-index -f --</p>

<p>which will force all existing *.h files to be replaced
with their cached copies. If an empty command line implied
&quot;all&quot;, then this would force-refresh everything in
the index, which was not the point. But since git
checkout-index accepts --stdin it would be faster to
use:</p>

<p>$ find . -name &acute;*.h&acute; -print0 | git
checkout-index -f -z --stdin</p>

<p>The -- is just a good idea when you know the rest will
be filenames; it will prevent problems with a filename of,
for example, -a. Using -- is probably a good policy in
scripts.</p>

<p>USING --TEMP OR --STAGE=ALL When --temp is used (or
implied by --stage=all) git checkout-index will create a
temporary file for each index entry being checked out. The
index will not be updated with stat information. These
options can be useful if the caller needs all stages of all
unmerged entries so that the unmerged files can be processed
by an external merge tool.</p>

<p>A listing will be written to stdout providing the
association of temporary file names to tracked path names.
The listing format has two variations:</p>

<p>1. tempname TAB path RS</p>

<p>The first format is what gets used when --stage is
omitted or is not --stage=all. The field tempname is the
temporary file name holding the file content and path is the
tracked path name in the index. Only the requested entries
are output.</p>

<p>2. stage1temp SP stage2temp SP stage3tmp TAB path RS</p>

<p>The second format is what gets used when --stage=all.
The three stage temporary fields (stage1temp, stage2temp,
stage3temp) list the name of the temporary file if there is
a stage entry in the index or . if there is no stage entry.
Paths which only have a stage 0 entry will always be omitted
from the output.</p>

<p>In both formats RS (the record separator) is newline by
default but will be the null byte if -z was passed on the
command line. The temporary file names are always safe
strings; they will never contain directory separators or
whitespace characters. The path field is always relative to
the current directory and the temporary file names are
always relative to the top level directory.</p>

<p>If the object being copied out to a temporary file is a
symbolic link the content of the link will be written to a
normal file. It is up to the end-user or the Porcelain to
make use of this information.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES To update and refresh only the files already
checked out</p>

<p>$ git checkout-index -n -f -a &amp;&amp; git
update-index --ignore-missing --refresh</p>

<p>Using git checkout-index to &quot;export an entire
tree&quot; The prefix ability basically makes it trivial to
use git checkout-index as an &quot;export as tree&quot;
function. Just read the desired tree into the index, and
do:</p>

<p>$ git checkout-index --prefix=git-export-dir/ -a</p>

<p>git checkout-index will &quot;export&quot; the index
into the specified directory.</p>

<p>The final &quot;/&quot; is important. The exported name
is literally just prefixed with the specified string.
Contrast this with the following example.</p>

<p>Export files with a prefix</p>

<p>$ git checkout-index --prefix=.merged- Makefile</p>

<p>This will check out the currently cached copy of
Makefile into the file .merged-Makefile.</p>
