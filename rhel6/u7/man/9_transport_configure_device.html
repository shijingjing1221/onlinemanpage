<p>TRANSPORT_CONFIGURE_(9) Device drivers infrastructure
TRANSPORT_CONFIGURE_(9)</p>

<p>NAME transport_configure_device - configure an already
set up device</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS void transport_configure_device(struct device *
dev);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS dev generic device representing device to be
configured</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The idea of configure is simply to provide a
point within the setup process to allow the transport class
to extract information from a device after it has been
setup. This is used in SCSI because we have to have a setup
device to begin using the HBA, but after we send the initial
inquiry, we use configure to extract the device parameters.
The device need not have been added to be configured.</p>
