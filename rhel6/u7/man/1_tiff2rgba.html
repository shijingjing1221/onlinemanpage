<p>NAME tiff2rgba - convert a TIFF image to RGBA color
space</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS tiff2rgba [ options ] input.tif output.tif</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Tiff2rgba converts a wide variety of TIFF
images into an RGBA TIFF image. This includes the ability to
translate different color spaces and photometric
interpretation into RGBA, support for alpha blending, and
translation of many different bit depths into a 32bit RGBA
image.</p>

<p>Internally this program is implemented using the
TIFFReadRGBAImage() function, and it suffers any limitations
of that image. This includes limited support for &gt; 8
BitsPerSample images, and flaws with some eso- teric
combinations of BitsPerSample, photometric interpretation,
block organization and planar configuration.</p>

<p>The generated images are stripped images with four
samples per pixel (red, green, blue and alpha) or if the -n
flag is used, three samples per pixel (red, green, and
blue). The resulting images are always pla- nar
configuration contiguous. For this reason, this program is a
use- ful utility for transform exotic TIFF files into a form
ingestible by almost any TIFF supporting software.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -c Specify a compression scheme to use when
writing image data: -c none for no compression (the
default), -c packbits for the Pack- Bits compression
algorithm, -c zip for the Deflate compression algorithm, -c
jpeg for the JPEG compression algorithm, and -c lzw for
Lempel-Ziv &amp; Welch.</p>

<p>-r Write data with a specified number of rows per strip;
by default the number of rows/strip is selected so that each
strip is approximately 8 kilobytes.</p>

<p>-b Process the image one block (strip/tile) at a time
instead of by reading the whole image into memory at once.
This may be neces- sary for very large images on systems
with limited RAM.</p>

<p>-n Drop the alpha component from the output file,
producing a pure RGB file. Currently this does not work if
the -b flag is also in effect.</p>
