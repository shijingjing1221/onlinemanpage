<p>Name mattrib - change MSDOS file attribute flags</p>

<p>Note of warning This manpage has been automatically
generated from mtoolss texinfo documentation, and may not be
entirely accurate or complete. See the end of this man page
for details.</p>

<p>Description Mattrib is used to change MS-DOS file
attribute flags. It has the fol- lowing syntax:</p>

<p>mattrib [-a|+a] [-h|+h] [-r|+r] [-s|+s] [-/] [-p] [-X]
msdosfile [ msdosfiles ... ]</p>

<p>Mattrib adds attribute flags to an MS-DOS file (with the
+ operator) or remove attribute flags (with the -
operator).</p>

<p>Mattrib supports the following attribute bits:</p>

<p>a Archive bit. Used by some backup programs to indicate
a new file.</p>

<p>r Read-only bit. Used to indicate a read-only file.
Files with this bit set cannot be erased by DEL nor
modified.</p>

<p>s System bit. Used by MS-DOS to indicate a operating
system file.</p>

<p>h Hidden bit. Used to make files hidden from DIR.</p>

<p>Mattrib supports the following command line flags:</p>

<p>/ Recursive. Recursively list the attributes of the
files in the subdirectories.</p>

<p>X Concise. Prints the attributes whithout any whitespace
padding. If neither the &quot;/&quot; option is given, nor
the msdosfile contains a wildcard, and there is only one
Msdos file parameter on the com- mand line, only the
attribute is printed, and not the filename. This option is
convenient for scripts</p>

<p>p Replay mode. Outputs a series of mformat commands that
will reproduce the current situation, starting from a
situation as left by untarring the Dos filesystem. Commands
are only output for attribute settings that differ from the
default (archive bit set for files, unset for directories).
This option is intended to be used in addition to tar. The
readonly attribute is not taken into account, as tar can set
that one itself.</p>

<p>Viewing the texi doc This manpage has been automatically
generated from mtoolss texinfo documentation. However, this
process is only approximative, and some items, such as
crossreferences, footnotes and indices are lost in this
translation process. Indeed, these items have no appropriate
represen- tation in the manpage format. Moreover, not all
information has been translated into the manpage version.
Thus I strongly advise you to use the original texinfo doc.
See the end of this manpage for instructions how to view the
texinfo doc.</p>

<p>* To generate a printable copy from the texinfo doc, run
the fol- lowing commands:</p>

<p>./configure; make dvi; dvips mtools.dvi</p>

<p>* To generate a html copy, run:</p>

<p>./configure; make html</p>

<p>A premade html can be found at http://www.gnu.org/soft-
ware/mtools/manual/mtools.html</p>

<p>* To generate an info copy (browsable using emacs info
mode), run:</p>

<p>./configure; make info</p>

<p>The texinfo doc looks most pretty when printed or as
html. Indeed, in the info version certain examples are
difficult to read due to the quoting conventions used in
info.</p>
