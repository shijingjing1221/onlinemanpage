<p>NAME git-gc - Cleanup unnecessary files and optimize the
local repository</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS git gc [--aggressive] [--auto] [--quiet]
[--prune=&lt;date&gt; | --no-prune]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Runs a number of housekeeping tasks within
the current repository, such as compressing file revisions
(to reduce disk space and increase performance) and removing
unreachable objects which may have been created from prior
invocations of git add.</p>

<p>Users are encouraged to run this task on a regular basis
within each repository to maintain good disk space
utilization and good operating performance.</p>

<p>Some git commands may automatically run git gc; see the
--auto flag below for details. If you know what youre doing
and all you want is to disable this behavior permanently
without further considerations, just do:</p>

<p>$ git config --global gc.auto 0</p>

<p>OPTIONS --aggressive Usually git gc runs very quickly
while providing good disk space utilization and performance.
This option will cause git gc to more aggressively optimize
the repository at the expense of taking much more time. The
effects of this optimization are persistent, so this option
only needs to be used occasionally; every few hundred
changesets or so.</p>

<p>--auto With this option, git gc checks whether any
housekeeping is required; if not, it exits without
performing any work. Some git commands run git gc --auto
after performing operations that could create many loose
objects.</p>

<p>Housekeeping is required if there are too many loose
objects or too many packs in the repository. If the number
of loose objects exceeds the value of the gc.auto
configuration variable, then all loose objects are combined
into a single pack using git repack -d -l. Setting the value
of gc.auto to 0 disables automatic packing of loose
objects.</p>

<p>If the number of packs exceeds the value of
gc.autopacklimit, then existing packs (except those marked
with a .keep file) are consolidated into a single pack by
using the -A option of git repack. Setting gc.autopacklimit
to 0 disables automatic consolidation of packs.</p>

<p>--prune=&lt;date&gt; Prune loose objects older than date
(default is 2 weeks ago, overridable by the config variable
gc.pruneExpire). This option is on by default.</p>

<p>--no-prune Do not prune any loose objects.</p>

<p>--quiet Suppress all progress reports.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION The optional configuration variable
gc.reflogExpire can be set to indicate how long historical
entries within each branch s reflog should remain available
in this repository. The setting is expressed as a length of
time, for example 90 days or 3 months. It defaults to 90
days.</p>

<p>The optional configuration variable
gc.reflogExpireUnreachable can be set to indicate how long
historical reflog entries which are not part of the current
branch should remain available in this repository. These
types of entries are generally created as a result of using
git commit --amend or git rebase and are the commits prior
to the amend or rebase occurring. Since these changes are
not part of the current project most users will want to
expire them sooner. This option defaults to 30 days.</p>

<p>The optional configuration variable gc.rerereresolved
indicates how long records of conflicted merge you resolved
earlier are kept. This defaults to 60 days.</p>

<p>The optional configuration variable gc.rerereunresolved
indicates how long records of conflicted merge you have not
resolved are kept. This defaults to 15 days.</p>

<p>The optional configuration variable gc.packrefs
determines if git gc runs git pack-refs. This can be set to
&quot;nobare&quot; to enable it within all non-bare repos or
it can be set to a boolean value. This defaults to true.</p>

<p>The optional configuration variable gc.aggressiveWindow
controls how much time is spent optimizing the delta
compression of the objects in the repository when the
--aggressive option is specified. The larger the value, the
more time is spent optimizing the delta compression. See the
documentation for the --window&acute; option in
git-repack(1) for more details. This defaults to 250.</p>

<p>The optional configuration variable gc.pruneExpire
controls how old the unreferenced loose objects have to be
before they are pruned. The default is &quot;2 weeks
ago&quot;.</p>

<p>NOTES git gc tries very hard to be safe about the
garbage it collects. In particular, it will keep not only
objects referenced by your current set of branches and tags,
but also objects referenced by the index, remote tracking
branches, refs saved by git filter-branch in refs/original/,
or reflogs (which may reference commits in branches that
were later amended or rewound).</p>

<p>If you are expecting some objects to be collected and
they arent, check all of those locations and decide whether
it makes sense in your case to remove those references.</p>
