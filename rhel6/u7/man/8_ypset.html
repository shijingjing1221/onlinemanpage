<p>ypset(8) ypset(8)</p>

<p>NAME ypset - bind ypbind to a particular NIS server</p>

<p>SYNOPSYS ypset [ -d domain ] [ -h hostname ] server</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION In order to run ypset, ypbind must be
initiated with the -ypset or -ypsetme options. See
ypbind(8). ypset tells ypbind to get NIS ser- vices for the
specified domain from the ypserv(8) process running on
server.</p>

<p>In cases where several hosts on the local net are
supplying NIS ser- vices, it is possible for ypbind to
rebind to another host even while you attempt to find out if
the ypset operation succeeded. For example, you can
type:</p>

<p>example% ypset host1 example% ypwhich host2</p>

<p>which can be confusing. This is a function of the NIS
subsys- tem s attempt to know always a running NIS server,
and occurs when host1 does not respond to ypbind because it
is not running ypserv (or is overloaded), and host2, running
ypserv, gets the binding.</p>

<p>Server indicates the NIS server to bind to, and must be
speci- fied as a name or an IP address. This will work only
if the node has a current valid binding for the domain in
question, and ypbind has been set to allow use of ypset. In
most cases, server should be specified as an IP address.
OPTIONS -d domain Specify a domain other than the default
domain as returned by domainname(1). -h hostname Set the NIS
binding on host hostname instead of the local machine. SEE
