<p>AUTO.MASTER(5) AUTO.MASTER(5)</p>

<p>NAME auto.master - Master Map for automounter</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The auto.master map is consulted to set up
automount managed mount points when the autofs(8) script is
invoked or the automount(8) program is run. Each line
describes a mount point and refers to an autofs map
describing file systems to be mounted under the mount
point.</p>

<p>The default location of the master map is
/etc/auto.master but an al- ternate name may be given on the
command line when running the auto- mounter and the default
master map may changed by setting the MASTER_MAP_NAME
configuration variable in /etc/sysconfig/autofs. If the
master map name has no path then the system Name Service
Switch configuration will be consulted and each of the
sources searched in line with the rules given in the Name
Service Switch configuration.</p>

<p>Access to mounts in maps is governed by a key.</p>

<p>For direct maps the mount point is always specified
as:</p>

<p>/-</p>

<p>and the key used within the direct map is the full path
to the mount point. The direct map may have multiple entries
in the master map.</p>

<p>For indirect maps access is by using the path
scheme:</p>

<p>/mount-point/key</p>

<p>where mount-point is one of the entries listed in the
master map. The key is a single directory component and is
matched against entries in the map given in the entry (See
autofs(5)).</p>

<p>Additionally, a map may be included from its source as
if it were it- self present in the master map by including a
line of the form:</p>

<p>+[maptype[,format]:]map [options]</p>

<p>and automount(8) will process the map according to the
specification described below for map entries. Indirect map
entries must be unique in the master map so second and
subsequent entries for an indirect mount point are ignored
by automount(8).</p>

<p>FORMAT Master map entries have three fields separated by
an arbitrary number of spaces or tabs. Lines beginning with
# are comments. The first field is the mount point described
above and the second field is the name of the map to be
consulted for the mount point followed by the third field
which contains options to be applied to all entries in the
map.</p>

<p>The format of a master map entry is:</p>

<p>mount-point [map-type[,format]:]map [options]</p>

<p>mount-point Base location for the autofs filesystem to
be mounted. For in- direct maps this directory will be
created (as with mkdir -p) and is removed when the autofs
filesystem is umounted.</p>

<p>map-type Type of map used for this mount point. The
following are valid map types:</p>

<p>file The map is a regular text file.</p>

<p>program The map is an executable program, which is
passed a key on the command line and returns an entry
(everything be- sides the key) on stdout if successful.
Optinally, the keyword exec may be used as a synonym for
program to avoid confusion with amd formated maps mount type
pro- gram.</p>

<p>yp The map is a NIS (YP) database.</p>

<p>nisplus The map is a NIS+ database.</p>

<p>hesiod The map is a hesiod database whose filsys entries
are used for maps.</p>

<p>ldap or ldaps The map is stored in an LDAP directory. If
ldaps is used the appropriate certificate must be configured
in the LDAP client.</p>

<p>multi This map type allows the specification of multiple
maps separated by &quot;--&quot;. These maps are searched in
order to resolve key lookups.</p>

<p>format Format of the map data; currently the formats
recognized are sun, which is a subset of the Sun automounter
map format, hes- iod, for hesiod filesys entries and amd for
amd formated map en- tries. If the format is left
unspecified, it defaults to sun for all map types except
hesiod unless it is a top level amd mount that has a
configuration entry for the mount point path, in which case
the format used is amd.</p>

<p>map Name of the map to use. This is an absolute UNIX
pathname for maps of types file or program, and the name of
a database in the case for maps of type yp, nisplus, or
hesiod or the dn of an LDAP entry for maps of type ldap.</p>

<p>options Any remaining command line arguments without
leading dashes (-) are taken as options (-o) to mount.
Arguments with leading dashes are considered options for the
maps and are passed to au- tomount (8).</p>

<p>The sun format supports the following options:</p>

<p>-Dvariable=value Replace variable with value in map
substitutions.</p>

<p>-strict Treat errors when mounting file systems as
fatal. This is important when multiple file systems should
be mounted (multimounts). If this option is given, no file
system is mounted at all if at least one file system cant be
mounted.</p>

<p>[no]browse This is an autofs specific option that is a
pseudo mount option and so is given without a leading dash.
Use of the browse option pre-creates mount point directories
for in- direct mount maps so the map keys can be seen in a
direc- tory listing without being mounted. Use of this
option can cause performance problem if the indirect map is
large so it should be used with caution. The internal
program default is to enable browse mode for indirect mounts
but the default installed configuration overrides this by
setting BROWSE_MODE to &quot;no&quot; because of the poten-
tial performance problem.</p>

<p>nobind This is an autofs specific option that is a
pseudo mount option and so is given without a leading dash.
It may be used either in the master map entry (so it effects
all the map entries) or with individual map entries to pre-
vent bind mounting of local NFS filesystems. For direct
mount maps the option is only effective if specified on the
first direct map entry and is applied to all direct mount
maps in the master map. It is ignored if given on subsequent
direct map entries. It may be used on individ- ual map
entries of both types. Bind mounting of NFS file systems can
also be prevented for specific map entrys by adding the
&quot;port=&quot; mount option to the entries.</p>

<p>symlink This option makes bind mounting use a symlink
instead of an actual bind mount. It is an autofs specific
option that is a pseudo mount option and so is given without
a leading dash. It may be used with indirect map entries
only, either in the master map (so it effects all map en-
tries) or with individual map entries. The option is ig-
nored for direct mounts and non-root offest mount en-
tries.</p>

<p>-r, --random-multimount-selection Enables the use of
ramdom selection when choosing a host from a list of
replicated servers. This option is applied to this mount
only, overriding the global setting that may be specified on
the command line.</p>

<p>-w, --use-weight-only Use only specified weights for
server selection where more than one server is specified in
the map entry. If no server weights are given then each
available server will be tried in the order listed, within
proximity.</p>

<p>-t, --timeout &lt;seconds&gt; Set the expire timeout for
map entries. This option can be used to override the global
default given either on the command line or in the
configuration.</p>

<p>-n, --negative-timeout &lt;seconds&gt; Set the timeout
for caching failed key lookups. This op- tion can be used to
override the global default given ei- ther on the command
line or in the configuration.</p>

<p>BUILTIN MAP -hosts If &quot;-hosts&quot; is given as the
map then accessing a key under the mount point which
corresponds to a hostname will allow access to the exports
of that host. The hosts map cannot be dynamically updated
and requires a HUP signal to be sent to the daemon for it to
check hosts for an up- date. Due to possible hierarchic
dependencies within a mount tree, it might not be completely
updated during the HUP signal processing.</p>

<p>For example, with an entry in the master map of /net
-hosts accessing /net/myserver will mount exports from
myserver on directories below /net/myserver.</p>

<p>NOTE: mounts done from a hosts map will be mounted with
the &quot;no- suid,nodev,intr&quot; options unless
overridden by explicily specifying the &quot;suid&quot;,
&quot;dev&quot; or &quot;nointr&quot; options in the master
map entry.</p>

<p>LDAP MAPS If the map type ldap is specified the mapname
is of the form [//server- name/]dn, where the optional
servername is the name of the LDAP server to query, and dn
is the Distinguished Name of a subtree to search for map
entries. The old style ldap:servername:mapname is also
understood. Alternatively, the type can be obtained from the
Name Service Switch configuration, in which case the map
name alone must be given.</p>

<p>If no schema is set in the autofs configuration then
autofs will check each of the commonly used schema for a
valid entry and if one is found it will used for subsequent
lookups.</p>

<p>There are three common schemas in use:</p>

<p>nisMap Entries in the nisMap schema are nisObject
objects in the speci- fied subtree, where the cn attribute
is the key (the wildcard key is &quot;/&quot;), and the
nisMapEntry attribute contains the informa- tion used by the
automounter.</p>

<p>automountMap The automountMap schema has two variations
that differ in the attribute used for the map key. Entries
in the automountMap schema are automount objects in the
specified subtree, where the cn or automountKey attribute
(depending on local usage) is the key (the wildcard key is
&quot;/&quot;), and the automountInformation at- tribute
contains the information used by the automounter. Note that
the cn attribute is case insensitive.</p>

<p>The object classes and attributes used for accessing
automount maps in LDAP can be changed by setting entries in
the autofs configuration lo- cated in
/etc/sysconfig/autofs.conf.</p>

<p>NOTE: If a schema is given in the configuration then all
the schema configuration values must be set, any partial
schema specifica- tion will be ignored.</p>

<p>For amd format maps a different schema is used:</p>

<p>amdMap The amdmap schema contains attributes amdmapName,
amdmapKey and amdmapValue where amdmapName contains the name
of the containing map, amdmapKey contains the map key and
amdmapValue contains the map entry.</p>

<p>LDAP AUTHENTICATION, ENCRYPTED AND CERTIFIED CONNECTIONS
LDAP authenticated binds, TLS encrypted connections and
certification may be used by setting appropriate values in
the autofs authentication configuration file and configuring
the LDAP client with appropriate settings. The default
location of this file is /etc/autofs_ldap_auth.conf.</p>

<p>If this file exists it will be used to establish whether
TLS or authen- tication should be used.</p>

<p>An example of this file is:</p>

<p>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; ?&gt;
&lt;autofs_ldap_sasl_conf usetls=&quot;yes&quot;
tlsrequired=&quot;no&quot; authrequired=&quot;no&quot;
authtype=&quot;DIGEST-MD5&quot; user=&quot;xyz&quot;
secret=&quot;abc&quot; /&gt;</p>

<p>If TLS encryption is to be used the location of the
Certificate Author- ity certificate must be set within the
LDAP client configuration in or- der to validate the server
certificate. If, in addition, a certified connection is to
be used then the client certificate and private key file
locations must also be configured within the LDAP
client.</p>

<p>In OpenLDAP these may be configured in the ldap.conf
file or in the per-user configuration. For example it may be
sensible to use the sys- tem wide configuration for the
location of the Certificate Authority certificate and set
the location of the client certificate and private key in
the per-user configuration. The location of these files and
the configuration entry requirements is system dependent so
the documenta- tion for your installation will need to be
consulted to get further in- formation.</p>

<p>See autofs_ldap_auth.conf (5) for more information.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE /- auto.data /home /etc/auto.home /mnt
yp:mnt.map</p>

<p>This will generate two mountpoints for /home and /mnt
and install di- rect mount triggers for each entry in the
direct mount map auto.data. All accesses to /home will lead
to the consultation of the map in /etc/auto.home and all
accesses to /mnt will consult the NIS map mnt.map. All
accesses to paths in the map auto.data will trigger mounts
when they are accessed and the Name Service Switch
configuration will be used to locate the source of the map
auto.data.</p>
