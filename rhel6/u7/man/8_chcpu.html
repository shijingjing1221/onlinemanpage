<p>NAME chcpu - configure CPUs</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS chcpu [-e] [-d] [-c] [-g] cpu-list chcpu [-p]
mode chcpu -r chcpu [-h] [-V]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION chcpu can modify the state of CPUs. It can
enable or disable CPUs, scan for new CPUs, change the CPU
dispatching mode of the underlying hypervisor, and request
CPUs from the hypervisor (configure) or return CPUs to the
hypervisor (deconfigure).</p>

<p>Some options have a cpu-list argument. Use this argument
to specify a comma-separated list of CPUs. The list can
contain individual CPU addresses or ranges of addresses. For
example, 0,5,7,9-11 makes the command applicable to the CPUs
with the addresses 0, 5, 7, 9, 10, and 11.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -r, --rescan Trigger a rescan of CPUs. Use this
option on systems that do not automatically detect newly
attached CPUs. The Linux kernel then recognizes the new
CPUs.</p>

<p>-c, --configure cpu-list Configure all specified CPUs.
Configuring a CPU means that the hypervisor takes a CPU from
the CPU pool and assigns it to the virtual hardware on which
your kernel runs.</p>

<p>-e, --enable cpu-list Enable all specified CPUs.
Enabling a CPU means that the kernel sets it online. A CPU
must be configured, see -c, before it can be enabled.</p>

<p>-p, --dispatch mode Set the CPU dispatching mode
(polarization). This option has an effect only if your
hardware architecture and hypervisor support CPU
polarization. Available modes are:</p>

<p>horizontal The workload is spread across all available
CPUs. vertical The workload is concentrated on few CPUs.</p>

<p>-d, --disable cpu-list Disable all specified CPUs.
Disabling a CPU means that the ker- nel sets it offline.</p>

<p>-g, --deconfigure cpu-list Deconfigure all specified
CPUs. Deconfiguring a CPU means that the hypervisor removes
the CPU from the virtual hardware on which the Linux
instance runs and returns it to the CPU pool. A CPU must be
offline, see -d, before it can be deconfigured.</p>

<p>-h, --help Display help information and exit.</p>

<p>-V, --version Display version information and exit.</p>
