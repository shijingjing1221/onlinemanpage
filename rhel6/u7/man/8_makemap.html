<p>NAME makemap - create database maps for sendmail</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS makemap [-C file] [-N] [-c cachesize] [-d] [-D
commentchar] [-e] [-f] [-l] [-o] [-r] [-s] [-t delim] [-u]
[-v] maptype mapnam</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Makemap creates the database maps used by
the keyed map lookups in sendmail(8). It reads input from
the standard input and outputs them to the indicated
mapname.</p>

<p>Depending on how it is compiled, makemap handles up to
three different database formats, selected using the maptype
parameter. They may be</p>

<p>btree B-Tree format maps. This requires the new Berkeley
DB library.</p>

<p>hash Hash format maps. This also requires the Berkeley
DB library.</p>

<p>In all cases, makemap reads lines from the standard
input consisting of two words separated by white space. The
first is the database key, the second is the value. The
value may contain %n strings to indicate parameter
substitution. Literal percents should be doubled (%%). Blank
lines and lines beginning with # are ignored.</p>

<p>Notice: do not use makemap to create the aliases data
base, but newaliases which puts a special token into the
data base that is required by sendmail.</p>

<p>If the TrustedUser option is set in the sendmail
configuration file and makemap is invoked as root, the
generated files will be owned by the specified
TrustedUser.</p>

<p>Flags -C Use the specified sendmail configuration file
for looking up the TrustedUser option.</p>

<p>-N Include the null byte that terminates strings in the
map. This must match the -N flag in the sendmail.cf K
line.</p>

<p>-c Use the specified hash and B-Tree cache size.</p>

<p>-D Use to specify the character to use to indicate a
comment (which is ignored) instead of the default of #.</p>

<p>-d Allow duplicate keys in the map. This is only allowed
on B-Tree format maps. If two identical keys are read, they
will both be inserted into the map.</p>

<p>-e Allow empty value (right hand side).</p>

<p>-f Normally all upper case letters in the key are folded
to lower case. This flag disables that behaviour. This is
intended to mesh with the -f flag in the K line in
sendmail.cf. The value is never case folded.</p>

<p>-l List supported map types.</p>

<p>-o Append to an old file. This allows you to augment an
existing file.</p>

<p>-r Allow replacement of existing keys. Normally makemap
complains if you repeat a key, and does not do the
insert.</p>

<p>-s Ignore safety checks on maps being created. This
includes checking for hard or symbolic links in world
writable directo- ries.</p>

<p>-t Use the specified delimiter instead of white space
(also for dumping a map).</p>

<p>-u dump (unmap) the content of the database to standard
output.</p>

<p>-v Verbosely print what it is doing.</p>

<p>HISTORY The makemap command appeared in 4.4BSD.</p>
