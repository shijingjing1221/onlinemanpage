<p>NAME mapscrn - load screen output mapping table</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS mapscrn [-v] [-o map.orig] mapfile</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The mapscrn command is obsolete - its
function is now built-in into setfont. However, for
backwards compatibility it is still available as a separate
command.</p>

<p>The mapscrn command loads a user defined output
character mapping table into the console driver. The console
driver may be later put into use user-defined mapping table
mode by outputting a special escape sequence to the console
device. This sequence is &lt;esc&gt;(K for the G0 character
set and &lt;esc&gt;)K for the G1 character set. When the -o
option is given, the old map is saved in map.orig.</p>

<p>USE There are two kinds of mapping tables:
direct-to-font tables, that give a font position for each
user byte value, and user-to-unicode tables that give a
unicode value for each user byte. The corresponding glyph is
now found using the unicode index of the font. The command
mapscrn trivial sets up a one-to-one direct-to-font table
where user bytes directly address the font. This is useful
for fonts that are in the same order as the character set
one uses. A command like mapscrn 8859-2 sets up a
user-to-unicode table that assumes that the user uses ISO
8859-2.</p>

<p>INPUT FORMAT The mapscrn command can read the map in
either of two formats: 1. 256 or 512 bytes binary data 2.
two-column text file Format (1) is a direct image of the
translation table. The 256-bytes tables are direct-to-font,
the 512-bytes tables are user-to-unicode tables. Format (2)
is used to fill the table as follows: cell with offset
mentioned in the first column is filled with the value
mentioned in the second column. When values larger than 255
occur, or values are written using the U+xxxx notation, the
table is assumed to be a user- to-unicode table, otherwise
it is a direct-to-font table.</p>

<p>Values in the file may be specified in one of several
formats: 1. Decimal: String of decimal digits not starting
with 0 2. Octal: String of octal digits beginning with 0. 3.
Hexadecimal: String of hexadecimal digits preceded by
&quot;0x&quot;. 4. Unicode: String of four hexadecimal
digits preceded by &quot;U+&quot;. 5. Character: Single
character enclosed in single quotes. (And the binary value
is used.) Note that blank, comma, tab character and # cannot
be specified with this format. 6. UTF-8 Character: Single
(possibly multi-byte) UTF-8 character, enclosed in single
quotes.</p>

<p>Note that control characters (with codes &lt; 32) cannot
be re-mapped with mapscrn because they have special meaning
for the driver.</p>

<p>FILES /lib/kbd/consoletrans is the default directory for
screen mappings.</p>
