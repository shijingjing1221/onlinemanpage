<p>NAME kpasswd - change a users Kerberos password</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS kpasswd [principal]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The kpasswd command is used to change a
Kerberos principals password. Kpasswd prompts for the
current Kerberos password, which is used to obtain a
changepw ticket from the KDC for the user s Kerberos realm.
If kpasswd successfully obtains the changepw ticket, the
user is prompted twice for the new password, and the
password is changed.</p>

<p>If the principal is governed by a policy that specifies
the length and/or number of character classes required in
the new password, the new password must conform to the
policy. (The five character classes are lower case, upper
case, numbers, punctuation, and all other charac- ters.)</p>

<p>OPTIONS principal change the password for the Kerberos
principal principal. Oth- erwise, kpasswd uses the principal
name from an existing ccache if there is one; if not, the
principal is derived from the iden- tity of the user
invoking the kpasswd command.</p>

<p>PORTS kpasswd looks first for kpasswd_server = host:port
in the [realms] sec- tion of the krb5.conf file under the
current realm. If that is miss- ing, kpasswd looks for the
admin_server entry, but substitutes 464 for the port.</p>

<p>BUGS kpasswd may not work with multi-homed hosts running
on the Solaris platform.</p>
