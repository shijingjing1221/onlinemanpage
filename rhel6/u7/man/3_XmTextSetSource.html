<p>NAME XmTextSetSource A Text function that sets the
source of the widget</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;Xm/Text.h&gt; void
XmTextSetSource( Widget widget, XmTextSource source,
XmTextPosition top_character, XmTextPosition
cursor_position);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION XmTextSetSource sets the source of the Text
widget. Text widgets can share sources of text so that
editing in one widget is reflected in another. This function
sets the source of one widget so that it can share the
source of another widget.</p>

<p>Setting a new text source destroys the old text source
if no other Text widgets are using that source. To replace a
text source but keep it for later use, create an unmanaged
Text widget and set its source to the text source you want
to keep.</p>

<p>widget Specifies the Text widget ID.</p>

<p>source Specifies the source with which the widget
displays text. This can be a value returned by the
XmTextGetSource(3) func- tion. If no source is specified,
the widget creates a default string source.</p>

<p>top_character Specifies the position in the text to
display at the top of the widget. This is an integer number
of characters from the beginning of the text buffer. The
first character position is 0 (zero).</p>

<p>cursor_position Specifies the position in the text at
which the insert cursor is located. This is an integer
number of characters from the beginning of the text buffer.
The first character position is 0 (zero).</p>

resources, see XmText(3).</p>
