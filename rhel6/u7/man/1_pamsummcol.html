<p>NAME pamsummcol - summarize (sum, average, etc) a Netpbm
image by column</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pamsummcol { -sum | -mean | -min | -max }
[imagefile]</p>

<p>All options can be abbreviated to their shortest unique
prefix. You may use two hyphens instead of one. You may
separate an option name and its value with white space
instead of an equals sign.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pamsummcol reads a Netpbm image (PNM or PAM) and
performs a summary function over all the rows in each column
(sum, mean, etc.). It pro- duces an image of the same kind
that the same width and depth as the input, and one row
high. Its sample values are the result of the sum- mary.</p>

<p>pamsummcol performs the summary operation on each plane
independently.</p>

<p>pamsummcol performs the operation on the actual sample
values, not on the light intensities represented by them in
the case that the image is a PGM or PPM image.</p>

<p>If you want to summarize by row instead of by column,
run the input through pamflip first (and if you want the
output to be a single column instead of a single row, use
pamflip again).</p>

<p>If you want to summarize over the entire image (getting
a one-tuple output image), use pamsumm to get a summary row,
pamflip to turn that into a column, the pamsumm again to
summarize the column.</p>

<p>If you want to summarize the individual samples in an
entire image, instead of by tuple, use pamsumm.</p>

<p>pamsummcol performs the operation on the actual sample
values, not on the light intensities represented by them in
the case that the image is a PGM or PPM image or PAM
equivalent. You can use pnmgamma to convert such an image to
one with samples proportional to light intensity, and then
use pamsummcol on the result.</p>

<p>You can achieve the same thing as pamsummcol -mean with
pamscale. Just scale vertically to a single row, without
scaling horizontally at all. Use the pixel mixing
method.</p>

<p>OPTIONS You must specify exactly one of -sum, -mean,
-min, or -max.</p>

<p>-sum</p>

<p>This option makes the summary function addition. In each
column and plane of the output row, the sample value is the
sum of all the samples values in the same column and plane
of the input. If a result is greater than the image maxval,
it is clipped to the maxval.</p>

<p>-mean</p>

<p>This option makes the summary function arithmetic mean.
In each column and plane of the output row, the sample value
is the mean of all the samples values in the same column and
plane of the input.</p>

<p>-min</p>

<p>This option makes the summary function arithmetic
minimum. In each column and plane of the output row, the
sample value is the minimum of all the samples values in the
same column and plane of the input.</p>

<p>-max</p>

<p>This option makes the summary function arithmetic
maximum. In each column and plane of the output row, the
sample value is the maximum of all the samples values in the
same column and plane of the input.</p>
