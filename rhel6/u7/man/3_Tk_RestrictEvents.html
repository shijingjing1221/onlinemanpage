<p>Tk_RestrictEvents(3) Tk Library Procedures
Tk_RestrictEvents(3)</p>


<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME Tk_RestrictEvents - filter and selectively delay X
events</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tk.h&gt;</p>

<p>Tk_RestrictProc * Tk_RestrictEvents(proc, clientData,
prevClientDataPtr)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS Tk_RestrictProc *proc (in) Predicate procedure
to call to filter incoming X events. NULL means do not
restrict events at all.</p>

<p>ClientData clientData (in) Arbitrary argument to pass to
proc.</p>

<p>ClientData *prevClientDataPtr (out) Pointer to place to
save argument to pre- vious restrict proce- dure.

<p>DESCRIPTION This procedure is useful in certain
situations where applications are only prepared to receive
certain X events. After Tk_RestrictEvents is called,
Tk_DoOneEvent (and hence Tk_MainLoop) will filter X input
events through proc. Proc indicates whether a given event is
to be processed immediately, deferred until some later time
(e.g. when the event restriction is lifted), or discarded.
Proc is a procedure with arguments and result that match the
type Tk_RestrictProc: typedef Tk_RestrictAction
Tk_RestrictProc( ClientData clientData, XEvent *eventPtr);
The clientData argument is a copy of the clientData passed
to Tk_RestrictEvents; it may be used to provide proc with
information it needs to filter events. The eventPtr points
to an event under consid- eration. Proc returns a restrict
action (enumerated type Tk_Restric- tAction) that indicates
what Tk_DoOneEvent should do with the event. If the return
value is TK_PROCESS_EVENT, then the event will be handled
immediately. If the return value is TK_DEFER_EVENT, then the
event will be left on the event queue for later processing.
If the return value is TK_DISCARD_EVENT, then the event will
be removed from the event queue and discarded without being
processed.</p>

<p>Tk_RestrictEvents uses its return value and
prevClientDataPtr to return information about the current
event restriction procedure (a NULL return value means there
are currently no restrictions). These values may be used to
restore the previous restriction state when there is no
longer any need for the current restriction.</p>

<p>There are very few places where Tk_RestrictEvents is
needed. In most cases, the best way to restrict events is by
changing the bindings with the bind Tcl command or by
calling Tk_CreateEventHandler and Tk_Dele- teEventHandler
from C. The main place where Tk_RestrictEvents must be used
is when performing synchronous actions (for example, if you
need to wait for a particular event to occur on a particular
window but you do not want to invoke any handlers for any
other events). The obvi- ous solution in these situations is
to call XNextEvent or XWindow- Event, but these procedures
cannot be used because Tk keeps its own event queue that is
separate from the X event queue. Instead, call
Tk_RestrictEvents to set up a filter, then call
Tk_DoOneEvent to retrieve the desired event(s).</p>
