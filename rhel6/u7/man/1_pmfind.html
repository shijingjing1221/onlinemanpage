<p>PMFIND(1) PMFIND(1)</p>

<p>NAME pmfind - find PCP services on the network</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pmfind [-q] [-m mechanism] [-s service] [-r]
[-t timeout]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pmfind searches for instances of the
specified PCP service being adver- tised on the network and
prints a list of URLs corresponding to the services
discovered.</p>

<p>By default pmfind will search for all supported PCP
services, however a specific PCP service to discover can be
specified using the -s option. Supported services are
pmcd(1), pmproxy(1) and pmwebd(1).</p>

<p>The -m option sets the mechanism that pmfind uses when
performing ser- vice discovery. By default, or if the
keyword &quot;all&quot; is specified, every available
mechanism will be used (iteratively). Supported mecha- nisms
are:</p>

<p>avahi Searches for services which are broadcasting using
mDNS via avahi-daemon(8). An optional suffix
&quot;,timeout=N&quot; may be added to limit the amount of
time waiting for the avahi-daemon. N is a floating point
number specifying the number of seconds to wait. The default
is 0.5 seconds. This timeout may also be specified by
setting the environment variable AVAHI_DISCOVERY_TIMEOUT to
the desired number of seconds. If both are specified, then
the value specified in the environment variable takes
precedence.</p>

<p>probe=&lt;net-address&gt;/&lt;mask-bits&gt; Actively
probes the given subnet for the requested PCP ser- vice(s).
&lt;net-address&gt; is an inet or ipv6 network address and
&lt;mask-bits&gt; is the number of bits used to define the
subnet. For example, 192.168.1.0/24 defines an 8 bit subnet
consisting of the addresses 192.168.1.0 through
192.168.1.255. An optional suffix &quot;,maxThreads=N&quot;
may be added to limit the number of threads used while
probing. The default is the value of FD_SET- SIZE or the
number of addresses in the subnet, whichever is less. An
optional suffix &quot;,timeout=N&quot; may be added to limit
the amount of time waiting for each connection attempt. N is
a floating point number specifying the number of seconds to
wait. The default is 20ms.</p>

<p>The -r option requests that DNS name resolution be
attempted for the addresses of any discovered services. The
default is to display the network addresses of any
discovered services.</p>

<p>The -t option sets the maximum amount of time that
pmfind will take before interrupting the service discovery.
The argument is a floating point number representing the
number of seconds before timing out. The default is to take
as much time as is needed to complete the process.</p>

<p>The -q option suppresses all output on the standard
output stream.</p>

<p>PCP ENVIRONMENT Environment variables with the prefix
PCP_ are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP. On each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in pcp.conf(5).</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS The value of the exit status from the
command is zero when services were successfully located, one
if no services were found, and two if an error occurred.</p>

<p>In the event of an error, a message will be generated on
standard error that is intended to be self-explanatory.</p>

<p>SIGNALS pmfind will interrupt the service discovery
process when one of the following signals is received:
SIGHUP, SIGPIPE, SIGINT, SIGTERM, SIGXFSZ, SIGXCPU. pmfind
will report any results which were discovered up to point of
the interruption.</p>

PMAPI(3), pmDiscoverSer- vices(3), pcp.conf(5) and
