<p>RNDC.CONF(5) BIND9 RNDC.CONF(5)</p>

<p>NAME rndc.conf - rndc configuration file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rndc.conf</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION rndc.conf is the configuration file for
rndc, the BIND 9 name server control utility. This file has
a similar structure and syntax to named.conf. Statements are
enclosed in braces and terminated with a semi-colon. Clauses
in the statements are also semi-colon terminated. The usual
comment styles are supported:</p>

<p>C style: /* */</p>

<p>C++ style: // to end of line</p>

<p>Unix style: # to end of line</p>

<p>rndc.conf is much simpler than named.conf. The file uses
three statements: an options statement, a server statement
and a key statement.</p>

<p>The options statement contains five clauses. The
default-server clause is followed by the name or address of
a name server. This host will be used when no name server is
given as an argument to rndc. The default-key clause is
followed by the name of a key which is identified by a key
statement. If no keyid is provided on the rndc command line,
and no key clause is found in a matching server statement,
this default key will be used to authenticate the servers
commands and responses. The default-port clause is followed
by the port to connect to on the remote name server. If no
port option is provided on the rndc command line, and no
port clause is found in a matching server statement, this
default port will be used to connect. The
default-source-address and default-source-address-v6 clauses
which can be used to set the IPv4 and IPv6 source addresses
respectively.</p>

<p>After the server keyword, the server statement includes
a string which is the hostname or address for a name server.
The statement has three possible clauses: key, port and
addresses. The key name must match the name of a key
statement in the file. The port number specifies the port to
connect to. If an addresses clause is supplied these
addresses will be used instead of the server name. Each
address can take an optional port. If an source-address or
source-address-v6 of supplied then these will be used to
specify the IPv4 and IPv6 source addresses respectively.</p>

<p>The key statement begins with an identifying string, the
name of the key. The statement has two clauses. algorithm
identifies the encryption algorithm for rndc to use;
currently only HMAC-MD5 is supported. This is followed by a
secret clause which contains the base-64 encoding of the
algorithm s encryption key. The base-64 string is enclosed
in double quotes.</p>

<p>There are two common ways to generate the base-64 string
for the secret. The BIND 9 program rndc-confgen can be used
to generate a random key, or the mmencode program, also
known as mimencode, can be used to generate a base-64 string
from known input. mmencode does not ship with BIND 9 but is
available on many systems. See the EXAMPLE section for
sample command lines for each.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE options { default-server localhost; default-key
samplekey; };</p>

<p>server localhost { key samplekey; };</p>

<p>server testserver { key testkey; addresses { localhost
port 5353; }; };</p>

<p>key samplekey { algorithm hmac-md5; secret
&quot;6FMfj43Osz4lyb24OIe2iGEz9lf1llJO+lz&quot;; };</p>

<p>key testkey { algorithm hmac-md5; secret
&quot;R3HI8P6BKw9ZwXwN3VZKuQ==&quot;; };</p>

<p>In the above example, rndc will by default use the
server at localhost (127.0.0.1) and the key called
samplekey. Commands to the localhost server will use the
samplekey key, which must also be defined in the servers
configuration file with the same name and secret. The key
statement indicates that samplekey uses the HMAC-MD5
algorithm and its secret clause contains the base-64
encoding of the HMAC-MD5 secret enclosed in double
quotes.</p>

<p>If rndc -s testserver is used then rndc will connect to
server on localhost port 5353 using the key testkey.</p>

<p>To generate a random secret with rndc-confgen:</p>

<p>rndc-confgen</p>

<p>A complete rndc.conf file, including the randomly
generated key, will be written to the standard output.
Commented-out key and controls statements for named.conf are
also printed.</p>

<p>To generate a base-64 secret with mmencode:</p>

<p>echo &quot;known plaintext for a secret&quot; |
mmencode</p>

<p>NAME SERVER CONFIGURATION The name server must be
configured to accept rndc connections and to recognize the
key specified in the rndc.conf file, using the controls
statement in named.conf. See the sections on the controls
statement in the BIND 9 Administrator Reference Manual for
details.</p>
