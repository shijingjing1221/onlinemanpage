<p>MRTG-UNIX-GUIDE(1) mrtg MRTG-UNIX-GUIDE(1)</p>

<p>NAME mrtg-unix-guide - The MRTG 2.16.2 Linux/Unix
Installation Guide</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION MRTG comes to you in Source Code. This means
that you have to compile parts of it before you can use it
on a Unix machine. These instructions help you to do so.</p>

<p>PREPARATION In order to compile and use mrtg you need a
C compiler and a copy of perl installed on your machine. In
most cases this will already be available. In case it is
not, here are some starting points. Below Ill give you a
detailed run through the whole compilation process.</p>

<p>GCC The GNU C compiler comes preinstalled on most of the
free Unicies out there. For commercial derivatives you may
have to download and compile it first. If you have no
compiler at all there is a chicken and egg problem, but
there are also precompiled versions of gcc available for
most operating systems.</p>

<p>http://gcc.gnu.org/</p>

<p>Perl Large parts of the MRTG system are written in the
Perl scripting language. Make sure there is a recent copy of
perl on your machine (try perl -v). At least version 5.005
is required for mrtg to work well. If you use SNMPV3 and
other new features you should use at least 5.8.</p>

<p>You can get the latest perl from</p>

<p>http://www.perl.com/</p>

<p>MRTG generates traffic graphs in the PNG format. To be
able to do this it needs several 3rd party libraries. When
compiling these libraries I urge you to make sure you
compile them as static libraries. There is just much less
trouble ahead if you are doing it like this. See the
Instructions in the next section for inspiration. Note that
many free unices have all the required libraries already in
place so there is no need to install another copy. To check
it is best to skip all the library instructions below and go
straight into the mrtg compile.</p>

<p>If the first attempt fails and you do not get a working
version of mrtg, try compiling new copies of all libraries
as explained below. Do this BEFORE you send email to me
about problems compiling mrtg.</p>

<p>gd This is a basic graph drawing library created by
Thomas Boutell. Note that all releases after Version 1.3
only create PNG images. This is because a) Thomas got into
trouble because the GIF format which it used to produce uses
a compression technology patented by Unisys. b) PNG is more
efficient and patent free. MRTG can work with old and new
version of the GD library. You can get a recent copy of GD
from:</p>

<p>http://www.boutell.com/gd/</p>

<p>libpng Is required by gd in order to produce PNG
graphics files. Get it from:</p>

<p>http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html</p>

<p>zlib Is needed by libpng to compress the graphics files
you create. Get a copy from</p>

<p>http://www.gzip.org/zlib</p>

<p>And last but not least you also need mrtg itself. In
case you have not yet downloaded it, you can find a copy on
my website:</p>

<p>http://oss.oetiker.ch/mrtg/pub</p>

<p>LIBRARY COMPILATION In this section I will give you step
by step instructions on how to compile the various libraries
required for the compilation of mrtg. Note that these
libaries may already be installed if you have a *BSD or
Linux system so you can skip recompiling them. The wget
program used below is a simple web downloader. You can also
enter the address into your netscape if you dont have wget
available.</p>

<p>First lets create a directory for the compilation. Note
that this may already exist on your system. No problem, just
use it.</p>

<p>mkdir -p /usr/local/src cd /usr/local/src</p>

<p>If you do not have zlib installed:</p>

<p>wget http://www.gzip.org/zlib/zlib-1.1.4.tar.gz gunzip
-c zlib-*.tar.gz | tar xf - rm zlib-*.tar.gz mv zlib-* zlib
cd zlib ./configure make cd ..</p>

<p>If you dont have libpng installed</p>

<p>wget
http://public.planetmirror.com/pub/sourceforge/l/li/libpng/libpng-1.0.15.tar.gz
gunzip -c libpng-*.tar.gz |tar xf - rm libpng-*.tar.gz mv
libpng-* libpng cd libpng make -f scripts/makefile.std
CC=gcc ZLIBLIB=../zlib ZLIBINC=../zlib rm *.so.* *.so cd
..</p>

<p>And now you can compile gd</p>

<p>For versions up to 1.8.4, try:</p>

<p>wget http://www.boutell.com/gd/http/gd-1.8.4.tar.gz
gunzip -c gd-*.tar.gz |tar xf - rm gd-*.tar.gz mv gd-* gd cd
gd</p>

<p>The characters at the end of the following lines mean
that all the following material should actually be written
on a single line.</p>

<p>perl -i~ -p -e s/gd_jpeg.o//g Makefile make
INCLUDEDIRS=&quot;-I. -I../zlib -I../libpng&quot;
LIBDIRS=&quot;-L../zlib -L. -L../libpng&quot;
LIBS=&quot;-lgd -lpng -lz -lm&quot; CFLAGS=&quot;-O
-DHAVE_LIBPNG&quot; cd ..</p>

<p>For versions starting around 2.0.11, try:</p>

<p>wget http://www.boutell.com/gd/http/gd-2.0.11.tar.gz
gunzip -c gd-2.0.11.tar.gz |tar xf - mv gd-2.0.11 gd cd gd
env CPPFLAGS=&quot;-I../zlib -I../libpng&quot;
LDFLAGS=&quot;-L../zlib -L../libpng&quot; ./configure
--disable-shared --without-freetype --without-jpeg make cp
.libs/* .</p>

<p>MRTG COMPILATION Ok, now everything is ready for the
mrtg compilation.</p>

<p>cd /usr/local/src gunzip -c mrtg-2.16.2.tar.gz | tar xvf
- cd mrtg-2.16.2</p>

<p>If all the libraries have been preinstalled on your
system you can con- figure mrtg by doing a simple:</p>

<p>./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mrtg-2</p>

<p>Otherwise you may have to give some hints on where to
find the various libraries required to compile mrtg:</p>

<p>./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mrtg-2
--with-gd=/usr/local/src/gd --with-z=/usr/local/src/zlib
--with-png=/usr/local/src/libpng</p>

<p>If you have RRDtool available you might want to tell
mrtg about it so that you can opt to use rrdtool with mrtg.
Check mrtg-rrd.</p>

<p>Configure will make sure your environment is fit for
building mrtg. If it finds a problem, it will tell you so
and it will also tell you what to do about it. If everything
is OK, you will end up with a custom Makefile for your
system. Now type:</p>

<p>make</p>

<p>This builds the rateup binary and edits all the perl
pathnames in the scripts. You can now install mrtg by
typing</p>

<p>make install (requires gnu install)</p>

<p>All the software required by MRTG is now installed under
the /usr/local/mrtg-2 subdirectory.</p>

<p>You can now safely delete the libraries we compiled
above. Then again, you might want to keep them around so
that you have them available when compiling the next version
of mrtg.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION The next step is to configure mrtg for
monitoring a network device. This is done by creating an
mrtg.cfg file which defines what you want to monitor.
Luckily, you dont have to dive straight in and start writ-
ing your own configuration file all by yourself. Together
with mrtg you also got a copy of cfgmaker. This is a script
you can point at a router of your choice; it will create a
mrtg configuration file for you. You can find the script in
the bin subdirectory.</p>

<p>cfgmaker --global WorkDir: /home/httpd/mrtg --global
Options[_]: bits,growright --output /home/mrtg/cfg/mrtg.cfg
community@router.abc.xyz</p>

<p>This example above will create an mrtg config file in
/home/mrtg/cfg assuming this is a directory visible on your
webserver. You can read all about cfgmaker in cfgmaker. One
area you might want to look at is the possibility of using
--ifref=ip to prevent interface renumbering troubles from
catching you.</p>

<p>If you want to start rolling your own mrtg configuration
files, make sure you read mrtg-reference to learn all about
the possible configura- tion options.</p>

<p>RUNNING MRTG Once you have created a configuration file,
try the following:</p>

<p>/usr/local/mrtg-2/bin/mrtg /home/mrtg/cfg/mrtg.cfg</p>

<p>This will query your router and also create your first
mrtg trafic graphs and webpages. When you run mrtg for the
first time there will be a lot of complaints about missing
log files. Don t worry, this is nor- mal for the first 2
times you start mrtg. If it keeps complaining after this
time you might want to look into the problem.</p>

<p>Starting mrtg by hand is not ideal in the long run. So
when you are satisfied with the results you can automate the
process of running mrtg in regular intervals (this means
every 5 minutes by default).</p>

<p>You can either add mrtg to your crontab with a line like
this:</p>

<p>0,5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45,50,55 * * * *
&lt;mrtg-bin&gt;/mrtg &lt;path to mrtg-cfg&gt;/mrtg.cfg
--logging /var/log/mrtg.log</p>

<p>or if you live in Linux Land the line may look like this
if you are using &quot;crontab -e&quot;</p>

<p>*/5 * * * * &lt;mrtg-bin&gt;/mrtg &lt;path to
mrtg-cfg&gt;/mrtg.cfg --logging /var/log/mrtg.log</p>

<p>or like this if you use /etc/crontab</p>

<p>*/5 * * * * mrtg-user &lt;mrtg-bin&gt;/mrtg &lt;path to
mrtg-cfg&gt;/mrtg.cfg --logging /var/log/mrtg.log</p>

<p>You can also run mrtg as a daemon process by adding the
line</p>

<p>RunAsDaemon: Yes</p>

<p>to your mrtg configuration file and then creating a
startup script in your system startup sequence.
Unfortunately, adding startup scripts differs widely amongst
different unix systems. The modern ones normally have a
directory called /etc/init.d or /etc/rc.d/init.d where you
put scripts which starts the process you want to run when
the system boots. Further you must create a symbolic link in
/etc/rc3.d or /etc/rc.d/rc?.d called S65mrtg (this is just a
sample name ... it is just important that it starts with S
followed by a two digit number). If you are not sure about
this, make sure you consult the documentation of your system
to make sure you get this right.</p>

<p>A minimal script to put into init.d might look like
this:</p>

<p>#! /bin/sh cd /usr/local/mrtg-2.16.2/bin &amp;&amp;
./mrtg --user=mrtg-user /home/httpd/mrtg/mrtg.cfg --logging
/var/log/mrtg.log</p>

<p>Note that this will only work with RunAsDaemon: Yes in
your mrtg.cfg file.</p>
