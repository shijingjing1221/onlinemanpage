<p>ARP(7) Linux Programmer s Manual ARP(7)</p>

<p>NAME arp - Linux ARP kernel module.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This kernel protocol module implements the
Address Resolution Protocol defined in RFC 826. It is used
to convert between Layer2 hardware addresses and IPv4
protocol addresses on directly connected networks. The user
normally doesn t interact directly with this module except
to configure it; instead it provides a service for other
protocols in the kernel.</p>

<p>A user process can receive ARP packets by using
packet(7) sockets. There is also a mechanism for managing
the ARP cache in user-space by using netlink(7) sockets. The
ARP table can also be controlled via ioctl(2) on any AF_INET
socket.</p>

<p>The ARP module maintains a cache of mappings between
hardware addresses and protocol addresses. The cache has a
limited size so old and less frequently used entries are
garbage-collected. Entries which are marked as permanent are
never deleted by the garbage-collector. The cache can be
directly manipulated by the use of ioctls and its behavior
can be tuned by the /proc interfaces described below.</p>

<p>When there is no positive feedback for an existing
mapping after some time (see the /proc interfaces below), a
neighbor cache entry is con- sidered stale. Positive
feedback can be gotten from a higher layer; for example from
a successful TCP ACK. Other protocols can signal for- ward
progress using the MSG_CONFIRM flag to sendmsg(2). When
there is no forward progress, ARP tries to reprobe. It first
tries to ask a local arp daemon app_solicit times for an
updated MAC address. If that fails and an old MAC address is
known, a unicast probe is sent ucast_solicit times. If that
fails too, it will broadcast a new ARP request to the
network. Requests are only sent when there is data queued
for sending.</p>

<p>Linux will automatically add a non-permanent proxy arp
entry when it receives a request for an address it forwards
to and proxy arp is enabled on the receiving interface. When
there is a reject route for the target, no proxy arp entry
is added.</p>

<p>Ioctls Three ioctls are available on all AF_INET
sockets. They take a pointer to a struct arpreq as their
argument.</p>

<p>struct arpreq { struct sockaddr arp_pa; /* protocol
address */ struct sockaddr arp_ha; /* hardware address */
int arp_flags; /* flags */ struct sockaddr arp_netmask; /*
netmask of protocol address */ char arp_dev[16]; };</p>

<p>SIOCSARP, SIOCDARP and SIOCGARP respectively set, delete
and get an ARP mapping. Setting and deleting ARP maps are
privileged operations and may only be performed by a process
with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability or an effective UID of
0.</p>

<p>arp_pa must be an AF_INET socket and arp_ha must have
the same type as the device which is specified in arp_dev.
arp_dev is a zero-terminated string which names a
device.</p>

<p>+-------------------------------------+ | arp_flags |
+----------------+--------------------+ |flag | meaning |
+----------------+--------------------+ |ATF_COM | Lookup
complete | +----------------+--------------------+ |ATF_PERM
| Permanent entry | +----------------+--------------------+
|ATF_PUBL | Publish entry |
+----------------+--------------------+ |ATF_USETRAILERS |
Trailers requested | +----------------+--------------------+
|ATF_NETMASK | Use a netmask |
+----------------+--------------------+ |ATF_DONTPUB | Dont
answer | +----------------+--------------------+</p>

<p>If the ATF_NETMASK flag is set, then arp_netmask should
be valid. Linux 2.2 does not support proxy network ARP
entries, so this should be set to 0xffffffff, or 0 to remove
an existing proxy arp entry. ATF_USETRAILERS is obsolete and
should not be used.</p>

<p>/proc interfaces ARP supports a range of /proc
interfaces to configure parameters on a global or
per-interface basis. The interfaces can be accessed by read-
ing or writing the /proc/sys/net/ipv4/neigh/*/* files. Each
interface in the system has its own directory in
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/neigh/. The setting in the
&quot;default&quot; directory is used for all newly created
devices. Unless otherwise specified, time-related interfaces
are spec- ified in seconds.</p>

<p>anycast_delay (since Linux 2.2) The maximum number of
jiffies to delay before replying to a IPv6 neighbor
solicitation message. Anycast support is not yet
implemented. Defaults to 1 second.</p>

<p>app_solicit (since Linux 2.2) The maximum number of
probes to send to the user space ARP dae- mon via netlink
before dropping back to multicast probes (see
mcast_solicit). Defaults to 0.</p>

<p>base_reachable_time (since Linux 2.2) Once a neighbor
has been found, the entry is considered to be valid for at
least a random value between base_reachable_time/2 and
3*base_reachable_time/2. An entry s validity will be
extended if it receives positive feedback from higher level
pro- tocols. Defaults to 30 seconds. This file is now
obsolete in favor of base_reachable_time_ms.</p>

<p>base_reachable_time_ms (since Linux 2.6.12) As for
base_reachable_time, but measures time in milliseconds.
Defaults to 30000 milliseconds.</p>

<p>delay_first_probe_time (since Linux 2.2) Delay before
first probe after it has been decided that a neigh- bor is
stale. Defaults to 5 seconds.</p>

<p>gc_interval (since Linux 2.2) How frequently the garbage
collector for neighbor entries should attempt to run.
Defaults to 30 seconds.</p>

<p>gc_stale_time (since Linux 2.2) Determines how often to
check for stale neighbor entries. When a neighbor entry is
considered stale, it is resolved again before sending data
to it. Defaults to 60 seconds.</p>

<p>gc_thresh1 (since Linux 2.2) The minimum number of
entries to keep in the ARP cache. The garbage collector will
not run if there are fewer than this num- ber of entries in
the cache. Defaults to 128.</p>

<p>gc_thresh2 (since Linux 2.2) The soft maximum number of
entries to keep in the ARP cache. The garbage collector will
allow the number of entries to exceed this for 5 seconds
before collection will be performed. Defaults to 512.</p>

<p>gc_thresh3 (since Linux 2.2) The hard maximum number of
entries to keep in the ARP cache. The garbage collector will
always run if there are more than this number of entries in
the cache. Defaults to 1024.</p>

<p>locktime (since Linux 2.2) The minimum number of jiffies
to keep an ARP entry in the cache. This prevents ARP cache
thrashing if there is more than one potential mapping
(generally due to network misconfiguration). Defaults to 1
second.</p>

<p>mcast_solicit (since Linux 2.2) The maximum number of
attempts to resolve an address by multi- cast/broadcast
before marking the entry as unreachable. Defaults to 3.</p>

<p>proxy_delay (since Linux 2.2) When an ARP request for a
known proxy-ARP address is received, delay up to proxy_delay
jiffies before replying. This is used to prevent network
flooding in some cases. Defaults to 0.8 sec- onds.</p>

<p>proxy_qlen (since Linux 2.2) The maximum number of
packets which may be queued to proxy-ARP addresses. Defaults
to 64.</p>

<p>retrans_time (since Linux 2.2) The number of jiffies to
delay before retransmitting a request. Defaults to 1 second.
This file is now obsolete in favor of retrans_time_ms.</p>

<p>retrans_time_ms (since Linux 2.6.12) The number of
milliseconds to delay before retransmitting a request.
Defaults to 1000 milliseconds.</p>

<p>ucast_solicit (since Linux 2.2) The maximum number of
attempts to send unicast probes before asking the ARP daemon
(see app_solicit). Defaults to 3.</p>

<p>unres_qlen (since Linux 2.2) The maximum number of
packets which may be queued for each unre- solved address by
other network layers. Defaults to 3.</p>

<p>VERSIONS The struct arpreq changed in Linux 2.0 to
include the arp_dev member and the ioctl numbers changed at
the same time. Support for the old ioctls was dropped in
Linux 2.2.</p>

<p>Support for proxy arp entries for networks (netmask not
equal 0xffffffff) was dropped in Linux 2.2. It is replaced
by automatic proxy arp setup by the kernel for all reachable
hosts on other inter- faces (when forwarding and proxy arp
is enabled for the interface).</p>

<p>The neigh/* interfaces did not exist before Linux
2.2.</p>

<p>BUGS Some timer settings are specified in jiffies, which
is architecture- and kernel version-dependent; see
time(7).</p>

<p>There is no way to signal positive feedback from user
space. This means connection-oriented protocols implemented
in user space will gen- erate excessive ARP traffic, because
ndisc will regularly reprobe the MAC address. The same
problem applies for some kernel protocols (e.g., NFS over
UDP).</p>

IPv4 and IPv6 functionality together.</p>

applicable.</p>
