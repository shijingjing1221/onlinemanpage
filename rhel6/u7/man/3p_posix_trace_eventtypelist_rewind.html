<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME posix_trace_eventtypelist_getnext_id,
posix_trace_eventtypelist_rewind - iterate over a mapping of
trace event types (TRACING)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;trace.h&gt;</p>

<p>int posix_trace_eventtypelist_getnext_id(trace_id_t
trid, trace_event_id_t *restrict event, int *restrict
unavailable); int
posix_trace_eventtypelist_rewind(trace_id_t trid);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The first time
posix_trace_eventtypelist_getnext_id() is called, the
function shall return in the variable pointed to by event
the first trace event type identifier of the list of trace
events of the trace stream identified by the trid argument.
Successive calls to posix_trace_eventtypelist_getnext_id()
return in the variable pointed to by event the next trace
event type identifier in that same list. Each time a trace
event type identifier is successfully written into the
variable pointed to by the event argument, the variable
pointed to by the unavailable argument shall be set to zero.
When no more trace event type identifiers are available, and
so none is returned, the variable pointed to by the
unavailable argument shall be set to a value different from
zero.</p>

<p>The posix_trace_eventtypelist_rewind() function shall
reset the next trace event type identifier to be read to the
first trace event type identifier from the list of trace
events used in the trace stream iden- tified by trid.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, these functions
shall return a value of zero. Otherwise, they shall return
the corresponding error number.</p>

<p>The posix_trace_eventtypelist_getnext_id() function
stores the trace event type identifier value in the object
pointed to by event, if suc- cessful.</p>

<p>ERRORS These functions shall fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The trid argument was not a valid trace stream
identifier.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
