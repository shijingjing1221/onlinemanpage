<p>IPSEC_PF_KEY(5) [FIXME: manual] IPSEC_PF_KEY(5)</p>

<p>NAME ipsec_pf_key - lists PF_KEY sockets registered with
KLIPS</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS cat /proc/net/pf_key</p>

<p>STACK Note that pf_key is only supported on the KLIPS
and MAST stacks. It is not supported on any other stack.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION /proc/net/pf_key is a read-only file which
lists the presently open PF_KEY sockets on the local system
and their parameters.</p>

<p>Each line lists one PF_KEY socket. A table entry
consists of:</p>

<p>+ sock pointer (sock)</p>

<p>+ PID of the socket owner (pid)</p>

<p>+ flag to indicate if the socket is dead (d)</p>

<p>+ socket wait queue (sleep)</p>

<p>+ socket pointer (socket)</p>

<p>+ next socket in chain (next)</p>

<p>+ previous socket in chain (prev)</p>

<p>+ last socket error (e)</p>

<p>+ pointer to destruct routine (destruct)</p>

<p>+ is this a reused socket (r)</p>

<p>+ has this socket been zapped (z)</p>

<p>+ socket family to which this socket belongs (fa)</p>

<p>+ local port number (n)</p>

<p>+ protocol version number (p)</p>

<p>+ Receive queue bytes committed (r)</p>

<p>+ Transmit queue bytes committed (w)</p>

<p>+ option memory allocations (o)</p>

<p>+ size of send buffer in bytes (sndbf)</p>

<p>+ timestamp in seconds (stamp)</p>

<p>+ socket flags (Flags)</p>

<p>+ socket type (Type)</p>

<p>+ connection state (St)</p>

<p>EXAMPLES c3b8c140 3553 0 c0599818 c05997fc 0 0 0 0 1 0
15 0 2 0 0 0 65535 0.103232 00000000 00000003 01</p>

<p>shows that there is one pf_key socket set up that starts
at c3b8c140, whose owning process has PID 3553, the socket
is not dead, its wait queue is at c0599818, whose owning
socket is at c05997fc, with no other sockets in the chain,
no errors, no destructor, it is a reused socket which has
not been zapped, from protocol family 15 (PF_KEY), local
port number 0, protocol socket version 2, no memory
allocated to transmit, receive or option queues, a send
buffer of almost 64kB, a timestamp of 0.103232, no flags
set, type 3, in state 1.</p>
