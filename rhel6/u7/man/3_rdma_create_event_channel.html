<p>RDMA_CREATE_EVENT_CHANNELLibrdmacm Programmer s
MaRDMA_CREATE_EVENT_CHANNEL(3)</p>

<p>NAME rdma_create_event_channel - Open a channel used to
report communication events.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;rdma/rdma_cma.h&gt;</p>

<p>struct rdma_event_channel * rdma_create_event_channel
(void);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS void no arguments</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Asynchronous events are reported to users
through event channels.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Returns a pointer to the created event
channel, or NULL if the request fails. On failure, errno
will be set to indicate the failure reason.</p>

<p>NOTES Event channels are used to direct all events on an
rdma_cm_id. For many clients, a single event channel may be
sufficient, however, when managing a large number of
connections or cm_ids, users may find it useful to direct
events for different cm_ids to different channels for
processing.</p>

<p>All created event channels must be destroyed by calling
rdma_destroy_event_channel. Users should call
rdma_get_cm_event to retrieve events on an event
channel.</p>

<p>Each event channel is mapped to a file descriptor. The
associated file descriptor can be used and manipulated like
any other fd to change its behavior. Users may make the fd
non-blocking, poll or select the fd, etc.</p>
