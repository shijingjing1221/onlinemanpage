<p>NAME build_skb - build a network buffer</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS struct sk_buff * build_skb(void * data);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS data data buffer provided by caller</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Allocate a new sk_buff. Caller provides
space holding head and skb_shared_info. data must have been
allocated by kmalloc The return is the new skb buffer. On a
failure the return is NULL, and data is not freed.</p>

<p>NOTES Before IO, driver allocates only data buffer where
NIC put incoming frame Driver should add room at head
(NET_SKB_PAD) and MUST add room at tail
(SKB_DATA_ALIGN(skb_shared_info)) After IO, driver calls
build_skb, to allocate sk_buff and populate it before giving
packet to stack. RX rings only contains data buffers, not
full skbs.</p>
