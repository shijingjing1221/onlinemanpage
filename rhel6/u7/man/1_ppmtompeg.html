<p>NAME ppmtompeg - encode an MPEG-1 bitstream</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ppmtompeg [options] parameter-file</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>ppmtompeg produces an MPEG-1 video stream. MPEG-1 is the
first great video compression method, and is what is used in
Video CDs (VCD). ppm- tompeg originated in the year 1995.
DVD uses a more advanced method, MPEG-2. There is an even
newer method called MPEG-4 which is also called Divx. I dont
know where one finds that used.</p>

<p>Theres technically a difference between a compression
method for video and an actual file (stream) format for a
movie, and I dont know if it can be validly said that the
format of the stream ppmtompeg produces is MPEG-1.</p>

<p>Mencoder from the Mplayer package is probably superior
for most video format generation needs, if for no other
reason than that it is more popular.</p>

<p>The programming library PM2V generates MPEG-2
streams.</p>

<p>Use Mplayer (not part of Netpbm) to do the reverse
conversion: to cre- ate a series of PNM files from an MPEG
stream.</p>

<p>param_file is a parameter file which includes a list of
input files and other parameters. The file is described in
detail below.</p>

<p>To understand this program, you need to understand
something about the complex MPEG-1 format. One source of
information about this standard format is the section
Introduction to MPEG in the Compression FAQ .</p>

<p>OPTIONS The -gop, -combine_gops, -frames, and
-combine_frames options are all mutually exclusive.</p>

<p>-stat stat_file This option causes ppmtompeg to append
the statistics that it write to Standard Output to the file
stat_file as well. The statistics use the following
abbreviations: bits per block (bpb), bits per frame (bpf),
seconds per frame (spf), and bits per second (bps).</p>

<p>These statistics include how many I, P, and B frames
there were, and information about compression and
quality.</p>

<p>-quiet num_seconds causes ppmtompeg not to report
remaining time more often than every num_seconds seconds
(unless the time estimate rises, which will happen near the
beginning of the run). A negative value tells ppmtompeg not
to report at all. 0 is the default (reports once after each
frame). Note that the time remaining is an estimate and does
not take into account time to read in frames.</p>

<p>-realquiet causes ppmtompeg to run silently, with the
only screen output being errors. Particularly useful when
reading input from stdin.</p>

<p>-no_frame_summary This option prevents ppmtompeg from
printing a summary line for each frame</p>

<p>-float_dct forces ppmtompeg to use a more accurate, yet
more computation- ally expensive version of the DCT.</p>

<p>-gop gop_num causes ppmtompeg to encode only the
numbered GOP (first GOP is 0). The parameter file is the
same as for normal usage. The output file will be the normal
output file with the suffix .gop.gop_num. ppmtompeg does not
output any sequence informa- tion.</p>

<p>-combine_gops causes ppmtompeg simply to combine some
GOP files into a single MPEG output stream. ppmtompeg
inserts a sequence header and trailer. In this case, the
parameter file needs only to contain the SIZE value, an
output file, and perhaps a list of input GOP files (see
below).</p>

<p>If you don t supply a list of input GOP files is used,
then ppm- tompeg assumes youre using the same parameter file
you used when you created the input (with the -gop option)
and calculates the corresponding gop filenames itself. If
this is not the case, you can specify input GOP files in the
same manner as nor- mal input files -- except instead of
using INPUT_DIR, INPUT, and END_INPUT, use GOP_INPUT_DIR,
GOP_INPUT, and GOP_END_INPUT. If no input GOP files are
specified, then the default is to use the output file name
with suffix .gop.gop_num, with gop_num starting from 0, as
the input files.</p>

<p>Thus, unless youre mixing and matching GOP files from
different sources, you can simply use the same parameter
file for creating the GOP files (-gop) and for later turning
them into an MPEG stream (-combine_gops).</p>

<p>-frames first_frame last_frame This option causes
ppmtompeg to encode only the frames numbered first_frame to
last_frame, inclusive. The parameter file is the same as for
normal usage. The output will be placed in separate files,
one per frame, with the file names being the normal out- put
file name with the suffix .frame.frame_num. No GOP header
information is output. (Thus, the parameter file need not
include the GOP_SIZE value)</p>

<p>Use ppmtompeg -combine_frames to combine these frames
later into an MPEG stream.</p>

<p>-combine_frames This option causes ppmtompeg simply to
combine some individual MPEG frames (such as you might have
created with an earlier run of ppmtompeg -frames) into a
single MPEG stream. Sequence and GOP headers are inserted
appropriately. In this case, the parameter file needs to
contain only the SIZE value, the GOP_SIZE value, an output
file, and perhaps a list of frame files (see below).</p>

<p>The parameter file may specify input frame files in the
same manner as normal input files -- except instead of using
INPUT_DIR, INPUT, and END_INPUT, use FRAME_INPUT_DIR,
FRAME_INPUT, and FRAME_END_INPUT. If no input frame files
are specified, then the default is to use the output file
name with suffix .frame.frame_num, with frame_num starting
from 0, as the input files.</p>

<p>-nice This option causes ppmtompeg to run any remote
processes &quot;nicely,&quot; i.e. at low priority. (This is
relevant only if you are running ppmtompeg in parallel mode.
Otherwise, there are no remote processes). See man nice.</p>

<p>-max_machines num_machines This option causes ppmtompeg
to use no more than num_machines machines as slaves for use
in parallel encoding.</p>

<p>-snr This option causes ppmtompeg to include the
signal-to-noise ratio in the reported statistics. Prints SNR
(Y U V) and peak SNR (Y U V) for each frame. In summary,
prints averages of luminance only (Y). SNR is defined as
10*log(variance of origi- nal/variance of error). Peak SNR
is defined as 20*log(255/RMSE). Note that ppmtompeg runs a
little slower when you use this option.</p>

<p>-mse This option causes ppmtompeg to report the mean
squared error per block. It also automatically reports the
quality of the images, so there is no need to specify -snr
then.</p>

<p>-bit_rate_info rate_file This option makes ppmtompeg
write bit rate information into the file rate_file. Bit rate
information is bits per frame, and also bits per
I-frame-to-I-frame.</p>

<p>-mv_histogram This option causes ppmtompeg to print a
histogram of the motion vectors as part of statistics. There
are three histograms -- one for P frame, one for forward B
frame, and one for backward B frame motion vectors.</p>

<p>The output is in the form of a matrix, each entry
corresponding to one motion vector in the search window. The
center of the matrix represents (0,0) motion vectors.</p>

<p>-debug_sockets This option causes ppmtompeg to print to
Standard Output mes- sages that narrate the communication
between the machines when you run ppmtompeg in parallel mode
.</p>

<p>-debug_machines This option causes ppmtompeg to print to
Standard Output mes- sages that narrate the progress of the
conversion on the various machines when you run ppmtompeg in
parallel mode .</p>

<p>PARAMETER FILE The parameter file must contain the
following lines (except when using the -combine_gops or
-combine_frames options):</p>

<p>PATTERN pattern This statement specifies the pattern
(sequence) of I frames, P frames, and B frames. pattern is
just a sequence of the letters I, P, and B with nothing
between. Example:</p>

<p>PATTERN IBBPBBPBBPBBPBB</p>

<p>See I Frames, P Frames, B Frames .</p>

<p>OUTPUT output file This names the file where the output
MPEG stream goes.</p>

<p>INPUT_DIR directory This statement tells where the input
images (frames) come from. If each frame is in a separate
file, directory is the directory where they all are. You may
use . to refer to the current directory. A null directory
refers to the root directory of the system file tree.</p>

<p>To have ppmtompeg read all the frames serially from
Standard Input, specify INPUT_DIR stdin</p>

<p>INPUT This line must be followed by a list of the input
files (in dis- play order) and then the line END_INPUT.</p>

<p>There are three types of lines between INPUT and
END_INPUT. First, a line may simply be the name of an input
file. Second, the line may be of the form single_star_expr
[x-y]. sin- gle_star_expr can have a single * in it. It is
replaced by all the numbers between x and y inclusive. So,
for example, the line tennis*.ppm [12-15] refers to the
files tennis12.ppm, ten- nis13.ppm, tennis14.ppm,
tennis15.ppm.</p>

<p>Uniform zero-padding occurs, as well. For example, the
line football.*.ppm [001-130] refers to the files
football.001.ppm, football.002.ppm, ..., football.009.ppm,
football.010.ppm, ..., football.130.ppm.</p>

<p>The third type of line is: single_star_expr [x-y+s],
where the line is treated exactly as above, except that we
skip by s. Thus, the line football.*.ppm [001-130+4] refers
to the files football.001.ppm, football.005.ppm,
football.009.ppm, foot- ball.013.ppm, etc.</p>

<p>Furthermore, a line may specify a shell command to
execute to generate lines to be interpreted as described
above, as if those lines were in the parameter file instead.
Use back ticks, like in the Bourne Shell, like this:</p>

<p>cat myfilelist</p>

<p>If input is from Standard Input (per the INPUT_DIR
statement), ppmtompeg ignores the INPUT/END_INPUT block, but
it still must be present.</p>

<p>BASE_FILE_FORMAT {PPM | PNM | YUV | JPEG | JMOVIE}
ppmtompeg must convert all input files to one of the
following formats as a first step of processing: PNM, YUV,
JPEG(v4), or JMOVIE. (The conversion may be trivial if your
input files are already in one of these formats). This line
specifies which of the four formats. PPM is actually a
subset of PNM. The separate specification is allowed for
back- ward compatibility. Use PNM instead of PPM in new
applications.</p>

<p>INPUT_CONVERT conversion_command You must specify how to
convert a file to the base file format. If no conversion is
necessary, then you would just say:</p>

<p>INPUT_CONVERT *</p>

<p>Otherwise, conversion_command is a shell command that
causes an image in the format your specified with
BASE_FILE_FORMAT to be written to Standard Output. ppmtompeg
executes the command once for each line between INPUT and
END_INPUT (which is normally, but not necessarily, a file
name). In the conversion command, ppmtompeg replaces each *
with the contents of that line.</p>

<p>If you had a bunch of gif files, you might say:
INPUT_CONVERT giftopnm *</p>

<p>If you have a bunch of separate a.Y, a.U, and a.V files
(where the U and V have already been subsampled), then you
might say:</p>

<p>INPUT_CONVERT cat *.Y *.U *.V</p>

<p>Input conversion is not allowed with input from stdin,
so use</p>

<p>INPUT_CONVERT *</p>

<p>as described above.</p>

<p>SIZE widthxheight</p>

<p>width and height are the width and height of each frame
in pix- els.</p>

<p>When ppmtompeg can get this information from the input
image files, it ignores the SIZE parameter and you may omit
it.</p>

<p>When the image files are in YUV format, the files dont
contain dimension information, so SIZE is required.</p>

<p>When ppmtompeg is running in parallel mode, not all of
the pro- cesses in the network have access to the image
files, so SIZE is required and must give the same dimensions
as the input image files.</p>

<p>YUV_SIZE widthxheight This is an obsolete synonym of
SIZE.</p>

<p>YUV_FORMAT {ABEKAS | PHILLIPS | UCB | EYUV | pattern}
This is meaningful only when BASE_FILE_FORMAT specifies YUV
format, and then it is required. It specifies the sub-format
of the YUV class.</p>

<p>GOP_SIZE n n is the number of frames in a Group of
Pictures. Except that because a GOP must start with an I
frame, ppmtompeg makes a GOP as much longer than n as it has
to to make the next GOP start with an I frame.</p>

<p>Normally, it makes sense to make your GOP size a
multiple of your pattern length (the latter is determined by
the PATTERN parameter file statement).</p>

<p>See Group Of Pictures .</p>

<p>SLICES_PER_FRAME n n is roughly the number of slices per
frame. Note, at least one MPEG player may complain if slices
do not start at the left side of an image. To ensure this
does not happen, make sure the num- ber of rows is divisible
by SLICES_PER_FRAME.</p>

<p>PIXEL {FULL | HALF} use half-pixel motion vectors, or
just full-pixel ones It is usually important that you use
half-pixel motion vectors, because it results in both better
quality and better compres- sion.</p>

<p>RANGE n Use a search range of n pixels in each of the
four directions from a subject pixel. (So the search window
is a square n*2 pixels on a side).</p>

<p>PSEARCH_ALG {EXHAUSTIVE | TWOLEVEL | SUBSAMPLE |
LOGARITHMIC} This statement tells ppmtompeg what kind of
search technique (algorithm) to use for P frames. You select
the desired combination of speed and compression. EXHAUSTIVE
gives the best compression, but LOGARITHMIC is the fastest.
TWOLEVEL is an exhaustive full-pixel search, followed by a
local half- pixel search around the best full-pixel vector
(the PIXEL option is ignored for this search technique).</p>

<p>BSEARCH_ALG {SIMPLE | CROSS2 | EXHAUSTIVE} This
statement tells ppmtompeg what kind of search technique
(algorithm) to use for B frames. SIMPLE means find best
forward and backward vectors, then interpolate. CROSS2 means
find those two vectors, then see what backward vector best
matches the best forward vector, and vice versa. EXHAUSTIVE
does an n-squared search and is extremely slow in relation
to the others (CROSS2 is about half as fast as SIMPLE).</p>

<p>IQSCALE n Use n as the qscale for I frames. See Qscale
.</p>

<p>PQSCALE n Use n as the qscale for P frames. See Qscale
.</p>

<p>BQSCALE n Use n as the qscale for B frames. See Qscale
.</p>

<p>REFERENCE_FRAME {ORIGINAL | DECODED} This statement
determines whether ppmtompeg uses the original images or the
decoded images when computing motion vectors. Using decoded
images is more accurate and should increase the playback
quality of the output, but it makes the encoding take longer
and seems to give worse compression. It also causes some
complications with parallel encoding. (see the section on
paral- lel encoding). One thing you can do as a trade-off is
select ORIGINAL here, and lower the qscale (see QSCALE if
the quality is not good enough.</p>

<p>Original or Decoded? (Normalized)</p>

Decoded 1000 1000 1000 969 919 Original 885 1373 1000 912
884</p>

<p>The following lines are optional:</p>

<p>FORCE_ENCODE_LAST_FRAME This statement is obsolete. It
does nothing.</p>

<p>Before Netpbm 10.26 (January 2005), ppmtompeg would drop
trail- ing B frames from your movie, since a movie cant end
with a B frame. (See I Frames, P Frames, B Frames . You
would have to specify FORCE_ENCODE_LAST_FRAME to stop that
from happening and get the same function that ppmtompeg has
today.</p>

<p>NIQTABLE This statement specifies a custom non-intra
quantization table. If you dont specify this statement,
ppmtompeg uses a default non-intra quantization table.</p>

<p>The 8 lines immediately following NIQTABLE specify the
quantiza- tion table. Each line defines a table row and
consists of 8 integers, whitespace-delimited, which define
the table columns.</p>

<p>IQTABLE This is analogous to NIQTABLE, but for the intra
quantization table.</p>

<p>ASPECT_RATIO ratio This statement specifies the aspect
ratio for ppmtompeg to spec- ify in the MPEG output. Im not
sure what this is used for.</p>

<p>ratio must be 1.0, 0.6735, 0.7031, 0.7615, 0.8055,
0.8437, 0.8935, 0.9157, 0.9815, 1.0255, 1.0695, 1.0950,
1.1575, or 1.2015.</p>

<p>FRAME_RATE rate This specifies the frame rate for
ppmtompeg to specify in the MPEG output. Some players use
this value to determine the play- back rate.</p>

<p>rate must be 23.976, 24, 25, 29.97, 30, 50, 59.94, or
60.</p>

<p>BIT_RATE rate This specifies the bit rate for Constant
Bit Rate (CBR) encod- ing.</p>

<p>rate must be an integer.</p>

<p>BUFFER_SIZE size This specifies the value ppmtompeg is
to specify in the MPEG output for the Video Buffering
Verifier (VBV) buffer size needed to decode the
sequence.</p>

<p>A Video Verifying Buffer is a buffer in which a decoder
keeps the decoded bits in order to match the uneven speed of
the decoding with the required constant playback speed.</p>

<p>As ppmtompeg encodes the image, it simulates the
decoding pro- cess in terms of how many bits would be in the
VBV as each frame gets decoded, assuming a VBV of the size
you indicate.</p>

<p>If you specify the WARN_VBV_UNDERFLOW statement,
ppmtompeg issues a warning each time the simulation
underflows the buffer, which suggests that an underflow
would occur on playback, which suggests the buffer is too
small.</p>

<p>If you specify the WARN_VBV_OVERFLOW statement,
ppmtompeg issues a warning each time the simulation
overflows the buffer, which suggests that an overflow would
occur on playback, which sug- gests the buffer is too
small.</p>

<p>WARN_VBV_UNDERFLOW</p>

<p>WARN_VBV_OVERFLOW See BUFFER_SIZE.</p>

<p>These options were new in Netpbm 10.26 (January 2005).
Before that, ppmtompeg issued the warnings always.</p>

<p>The following statements apply only to parallel
operation:</p>

<p>PARALLEL This statement, paired with END PARALLEL, is
what causes ppmtom- peg to operate in parallel mode. See
Parallel Operation .</p>

<p>END PARALLEL This goes with PARALLEL.</p>

<p>PARALLEL_TEST_FRAMES n The master starts off by
measuring each slave s speed. It does this by giving each
slave n frames to encode and noting how long the slave takes
to finish. These are not just test frames, though -- theyre
real frames and the results become part of the output.
ppmtompeg is old and measures time in undivided sec- onds,
so to get useful timings, specify enough frames that it will
take at least 5 seconds to process them. The default is
10.</p>

<p>If you specify FORCE_I_ALIGN, ppmtompeg will increase
the test frames value enough to maintain the alignment.</p>

<p>If there arent enough frames for every slave to have the
indi- cated number of test frames, ppmtompeg will give some
slaves fewer.</p>

<p>PARALLEL_TIME_CHUNKS t When you specify this statement,
the master attempts to feed work to the slaves in chunks
that take t seconds to process. It uses the speed
measurement it made when it started up (see PAR-
ALLEL_TEST_FRAMES) to decide how many frames to put in the
chunk. This statement obviously doesnt affect the first
batch of work sent to each slave, which is the one used to
measure the slaves speed.</p>

<p>Smaller values of t increase communication, but improve
load balancing. The default is 30 seconds.</p>

<p>You may specify only one of PARALLEL_TIME_CHUNKS, PARAL-
LEL_CHUNK_TAPER, and PARALLEL_PERFECT. PARALLEL_CHUNK_TAPER
is usually best.</p>

<p>PARALLEL_CHUNK_TAPER When you specify this statement,
the master distributes work like with PARALLEL_TIME_CHUNKS,
except that the master chooses the number of seconds for the
chunks. It starts with a large number and, as it gets closer
to finishing the job, reduces it. That way, it reduces
scheduling overhead when precise scheduling isnt helpful,
but still prevents a slave from finishing early after all
the work has already been handed out to the other slaves,
and then sitting idle while there s still work to do.</p>

<p>You may specify only one of PARALLEL_TIME_CHUNKS, PARAL-
LEL_CHUNK_TAPER, and PARALLEL_PERFECT. PARALLEL_CHUNK_TAPER
is usually best.</p>

<p>PARALLEL_PERFECT If this statement is present, ppmtompeg
schedules on the assump- tion that each machine is about the
same speed. The master will simply divide up the frames
evenly between the slaves -- each slave gets the same number
of frames. If some slaves are faster than others, they will
finish first and remain idle while the slower slaves
continue.</p>

<p>This has the advantage of minimal scheduling overhead.
Where slaves have different speeds, though, it makes
inefficient use of the fast ones. Where slaves are the same
speed, it also has the disadvantage that they all finish at
the same time and feed their output to the single Combine
Server in a burst, which makes less efficient use of the
Combine Server and thus can increase the total elapsed
time.</p>

<p>You may specify only one of PARALLEL_TIME_CHUNKS, PARAL-
LEL_CHUNK_TAPER, and PARALLEL_PERFECT. PARALLEL_CHUNK_TAPER
is usually best.</p>

<p>RSH remote_shell_command ppmtompeg executes the shell
command remote_shell_command to start a process on another
machine. The default command is rsh, and whatever command
you specify must have compatible semantics. ssh is usually
compatible. The command ppmtompeg uses is one like this: ssh
remote.host.com -l username shellcommand.</p>

<p>Be sure to set up .rhosts files or SSH key
authorizations where needed. Otherwise, you ll have to type
in passwords.</p>

<p>On some HP machines, rsh is the restricted shell, and
you want to specify remsh.</p>

<p>FORCE_I_ALIGN This statement forces each slave to encode
a chunk of frames which is a multiple of the pattern length
(see PATTERN). Since the first frame in any pattern is an I
frame, this forces each chunk encoded by a slave to begin
with an I frame.</p>

<p>This document used to say there was an argument to
FORCE_I_ALIGN which was the number of frames ppmtompeg would
use (and was required to be a multiple of the pattern
length). But ppmtompeg has apparently always ignored that
argument, and it does now.</p>

<p>KEEP_TEMP_FILES This statement causes ppmtompeg not to
delete the temporary files it uses to transmit encoded
frames to the combine server. This means you will be left
with a file for each frame, the same as you would get with
the -frames option.</p>

<p>This is mostly useful for debugging.</p>

<p>This works only if youre using a shared filesystem to
communi- cate between the servers.</p>

<p>This option was new in Netpbm 10.26 (January 2005).</p>

<p>Parameter File Notes If you use the -combine_gops
option, then you need to specify only the SIZE and OUTPUT
values in the parameter file. In addition, the parame- ter
file may specify input GOP files in the same manner as
normal input files -- except instead of using INPUT_DIR,
INPUT, and END_INPUT, use GOP_INPUT_DIR, GOP_INPUT, and
GOP_END_INPUT. If you specify no input GOP files, then
ppmtompeg uses by default the output file name with suffix
.gop.gop_num, with gop_num starting from 0, as the input
files.</p>

<p>If you use the -combine_frames option, then you need to
specify only the SIZE, GOP_SIZE, and OUTPUT values in the
parameter file. In addi- tion, the parameter file may
specify input frame files in the same man- ner as normal
input files -- except instead of using INPUT_DIR, INPUT, and
END_INPUT, use FRAME_INPUT_DIR, FRAME_INPUT, and
FRAME_END_INPUT. If no input frame files are specified, then
the default is to use the output file name with suffix
.frame.frame_num, with frame_num starting from 0, as the
input files.</p>

<p>Any number of spaces and tabs may come between each
option and value. Lines beginning with # are ignored. Any
other lines are ignored except for those between INPUT and
END_INPUT. This allows you to use the same parameter file
for normal usage and for -combine_gops and -com-
bine_frames.</p>

<p>The file format is case-sensitive so all keywords should
be in upper case.</p>

<p>The statements may appear in any order, except that the
order within a block statement (such as INPUT ... END INPUT)
is significant.</p>

<p>ppmtompeg is prepared to handle up to 16 B frames
between reference frames when encoding with input from
stdin. (To build a modified ppm- tompeg with a higher limit,
change the constant B_FRAME_RUN in frame.c and
recompile).</p>

<p>GENERAL USAGE INFORMATION Qscale The quantization scale
values (qscale) give a trade-off between quality and
compression. Using different Qscale values has very little
effect on speed. The qscale values can be set separately for
I, P, and B frames.</p>

<p>You select the qscale values with the IQSCALE, PQSCALE,
and BSCALE parameter file statements.</p>

<p>A qscale value is an integer from 1 to 31. Larger
numbers give better compression, but worse quality. In the
following, the quality numbers are peak signal-to-noise
ratio, defined as: signal-to-noise formula where MSE is the
mean squared error.</p>

<p>Search Techniques There are several different motion
vector search techniques available. There are different
techniques available for P frame search and B frame search.
Using different search techniques present little difference
in quality, but a large difference in compression and
speed.</p>

<p>There are 4 types of P frame search: Exhaustive,
TwoLevel, SubSample, and Logarithmic.</p>

<p>There are 3 types of B frame search: Exhaustive, Cross2,
and Simple.</p>

<p>The recommended search techniques are TwoLevel and
Logarithmic for P frame search, and Cross2 and Simple for B
frame search. Here are some numbers comparing the different
search methods:</p>

<p>1Smaller numbers are better compression.</p>

<p>2Larger numbers mean faster execution.</p>

<p>3Larger numbers mean better quality.</p>

<p>For some reason, Simple seems to give better
compression, but it depends on the image sequence.</p>

<p>Select the search techniques with the PSEARCH_ALG and
BSEARCH_ALG parameter file statements.</p>

<p>Group Of Pictures (GOP) A Group of Pictures (GOP) is a
roughly independently decodable sequence of frames. An MPEG
video stream is made of one or more GOPs. You may specify
how many frames should be in each GOP with the GOP_SIZE
parame- ter file statement. A GOP always starts with an I
frame.</p>

<p>Instead of encoding an entire sequence, you can encode a
single GOP. To do this, use the -gop command option. You can
later join the resulting GOP files at any time by running
ppmtompeg with the -com- bine_gops command option.</p>

<p>Slices A slice is an independently decodable unit in a
frame. It can be as small as one macroblock, or it can be as
big as the entire frame. Bar- ring transmission error,
adding slices does not change quality or speed; the only
effect is slightly worse compression. More slices are used
for noisy transmission so that errors are more recoverable.
Since usually errors are not such a problem, we usually just
use one slice per frame.</p>

<p>Control the slice size with the SLICES_PER_FRAME
parameter file state- ment.</p>

<p>Some MPEG playback systems require that each slice
consist of whole rows of macroblocks. If you are encoding
for this kind of player, if the height of the image is H
pixels, then you should set the SLICES_PER_FRAME to some
number which divides H/16. For example, if the image is 240
pixels (15 macroblocks) high, then you should use only 15,
5, 3, or 1 slices per frame.</p>

<p>Note: these MPEG playback systems are really wrong,
since the MPEG standard says this doesnt have to be so.</p>

<p>Search Window The search window is the window in which
ppmtompeg searches for motion vectors. The window is a
square. You can specify the size of the square, and whether
to allow half-pixel motion vectors or not, with the RANGE
and PIXEL parameter file statements.</p>

<p>I Frames, P Frames, B Frames In MPEG-1, a movie is
represented as a sequence of MPEG frames, each of which is
an I Frame, a P Frame, or a B Frame. Each represents an
actual frame of the movie (dont get confused by the dual use
of the word &quot;frame.&quot; A movie frame is a graphical
image. An MPEG frame is a set of data that describes a movie
frame).</p>

<p>An I frame (&quot;intra&quot; frame) describes a movie
frame in isolation -- without respect to any other frame in
the movie. A P frame (&quot;predic- tive&quot; frame)
describes a movie frame by describing how it differs from
the movie frame described by the latest preceding I or P
frame. A B frame (&quot;bidirectional&quot; frame) describes
a movie frame by describing how it differs from the the
movie frames described by the nearest I or P frame before
and after it.</p>

<p>Note that the first frame of a movie must be described
by an I frame (because there is no previous movie frame) and
the last movie frame must be described by an I or P frame
(because there is no subsequent movie frame).</p>

<p>Beyond that, you can choose which frames are represented
by which types. You specify a pattern, such as IBPBP and
ppmtompeg simply repeats it over and over throughout the
movie. The pattern affects speed, quality, and stream size.
Here is a chart which shows some of the trade-offs:</p>

<p>Comparison of I/P/B Frames (Normalized)</p>

<p>------------------------------------ Frame Type Size
Speed Quality I frames 1000 1000 1000</p>

<p>P frames 409 609 969 B frames 72 260 919</p>

<p>(this is with constant qscale)</p>

<p>A standard sequence is IBBPBBPBBPBBPBB.</p>

<p>Select the sequence with the PATTERN parameter file
statement.</p>

<p>Since the last MPEG frame cannot be a B frame (see
above), if the pat- tern you specify indicates a B frame for
the last movie frame of the movie, ppmtompeg makes it an I
frame instead.</p>

<p>Before Netpbm 10.26 (January 2005), ppmtompeg instead
drops the trail- ing B frames by default, and you need the
FORCE_ENCODE_LAST_FRAME parameter file statement to make it
do this.</p>

<p>The MPEG frames dont appear in the MPEG-1 stream in the
same order that the corresponding movie frames appear in the
movie -- the B frames come after the I and P frames on which
they are based. For example, if the movie is 4 frames that
you will represent with the pattern IBBP, the MPEG-1 stream
will start with an I frame describing movie frame 0. The
next frame in the MPEG-1 stream is a P frame describing
movie frame 3. The last two frames in the MPEG-1 stream are
B frames describing movie frames 1 and 2, respectively.</p>

<p>Specifying Input and Output Files Specify the input
frame images with the INPUT_DIR, INPUT, END_INPUT,
BASE_FILE_FORMAT, SIZE, YUV_FORMAT and INPUT_CONVERT
parameter file statements.</p>

<p>Specify the output file with the OUTPUT parameter file
statement.</p>

<p>Statistics ppmtompeg can generate a variety of
statistics about the encoding. See the -stat, -snr,
-mv_histogram, -quiet, -no_frame_summary, and -bit_rate_info
options.</p>

<p>PARALLEL OPERATION You can run ppmtompeg on multiple
machines at once, encoding the same MPEG stream. When you
do, the machines are used as shown in the fol- lowing
diagram. We call this parallel mode.</p>

<p>ppmtompeg-par.gif</p>

<p>To do parallel processing, put the statement</p>

<p>PARALLEL</p>

<p>in the parameter file, followed by a listing of the
machines, one machine per line, then</p>

<p>END_PARALLEL</p>

<p>Each of the machine lines must be in one of two forms.
If the machine has filesystem access to the input files,
then the line is:</p>

<p>machine user executable</p>

<p>The executable is normally ppmtompeg (you may need to
give the complete path if youve built for different
architectures). If the machine does not have filesystem
access to the input files, the line is:</p>

<p>REMOTE machine user executable parameter file</p>

<p>The -max_machines command option limits the number of
machines ppmtom- peg will use. If you specify more machines
in the parameter file than -max_machines allows, ppmtompeg
uses only the machines listed first. This is handy if you
want to experiment with different amounts of par-
allelism.</p>

<p>In general, you should use full path file names when
describing exe- cutables and parameter files. This includes
the parameter file argu- ment on the original invocation of
ppmtompeg.</p>

<p>All file names must be the same on all systems (so if
e.g. youre using an NFS filesystem, you must make sure it is
mounted at the same mount- point on all systems).</p>

<p>Because not all of the processes involved in parallel
operation have easy access to the input files, you must
specify the SIZE parameter file statement when you do
parallel operation.</p>

<p>The machine on which you originally invoke ppmtompeg is
the master machine. It hosts a combine server,, a decode
server, and a number of i/o servers, all as separate
processes. The other machines in the network (listed in the
parameter file) are slave machines. Each hosts a single
process that continuously requests work from the master and
does it. The slave process does the computation to encode
MPEG frames. It processes frames in batches identified by
the master.</p>

<p>The master uses a remote shell command to start a
process on a slave machine. By default, it uses an rsh shell
command to do this. But use the RSH parameter file statement
to control this. The shell command the master executes
remotely is ppmtompeg, but with options to indicate that it
is to perform slave functions.</p>

<p>The various machines talk to each other over TCP
connections. Each machine finds and binds to a free TCP port
number and tells its part- ners the port number. These port
numbers are at least 2048.</p>

<p>Use the PARALLEL_TEST_FRAMES, PARALLEL_TIME_CHUNKS, and
PARALLEL_PER- FECT parameter file statements to control the
way the master divides up work among the slaves.</p>

<p>Use the -nice command option to cause all slave
processes to run &quot;nicely,&quot; i.e. as low priority
processes. That way, this substantial and long-running CPU
load will have minimal impact on other, possibly
interactive, users of the systems.</p>

<p>SPEED Here is a look at ppmtompeg speed, in single-node
(not parallel) opera- tion:</p>

<p>Compression Speed</p>

<p>--------------------------------------- Machine Type
Macroblocks per second1 HP 9000/755 280 DEC 3000/400 247 HP
9000/750 191 Sparc 10 104 DEC 5000 68 1A macroblock is a
16x16 pixel square</p>

<p>The measurements in the table are with inputs and
outputs via a conven- tional locally attached filesystem. If
you are using a network filesystem over a single 10 MB/s
Ethernet, that constrains your speed more than your CPU
speed. In that case, dont expect to get better than 4 or 5
frames per second no matter how fast your CPUs are.</p>

<p>Network speed is even more of a bottleneck when the
slaves do not have filesystem access to the input files --
i.e. you declare them REMOTE.</p>

<p>Where I/O is the bottleneck, size of the input frames
can make a big difference. So YUV input is better than PPM,
and JPEG is better than both.</p>

<p>When youre first trying to get parallel mode working, be
sure to use the -debug_machines option so you can see whats
going on. Also, -debug_sockets can help you diagnose
communication problems.</p>
