<p>NAME ipa - IPA command-line interface</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ipa [options] [-c FILE] [-e KEY=VAL] COMMAND
[parameters]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION IPA is an integrated security information
management solution based on 389 Directory Server (formerly
know as Fedora Directory Server), MIT Kerberos, Dogtag
Certificate System, NTP and DNS. It includes a web interface
and command-line administration tools for managing identity
data.</p>

<p>This manual page focuses on the ipa script that serves
as the main com- mand-line interface (CLI) for IPA
administration.</p>

<p>More information about the project is available on its
homepage located at http://www.freeipa.org.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -c FILE Load configuration from FILE.</p>

<p>-d, --debug Produce full debugging output.</p>

<p>---delegate Delegate the users TGT to the IPA server</p>

<p>-e KEY=VAL Set environmental variable KEY to the value
VAL. This option overrides configuration files.</p>

<p>-h, --help Display a help message with a list of
options.</p>

<p>-n, --no-prompt Don t prompt for any parameters of
COMMAND, even if they are required.</p>

<p>-a, --prompt-all Prompt for all parameters of COMMAND,
even if they are optional.</p>

<p>-f, --no-fallback Don t fall back to other IPA servers
if the default doesnt work.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose Produce verbose output. A second -v
displays the XML-RPC request</p>

<p>COMMANDS The principal function of the CLI is to execute
administrative commands specified by the COMMAND argument.
The majority of commands are exe- cuted remotely over
XML-RPC on a IPA server listed in the configuration file
(see FILES section of this manual page).</p>

<p>From the implementation perspective, the CLI
distinguishes two types of commands - built-ins and plugin
provided.</p>

<p>Built-in commands are static and are all available in
all installations of IPA. There are two of them:</p>

<p>console Start the IPA interactive Python console.</p>

<p>help [TOPIC | COMMAND | topics | commands] Display help
for a command or topic.</p>

<p>The help command invokes the built-in documentation
system. Without parameters a list of built-in commands and
help topics is displayed. Help topics are generated from
loaded IPA plugin modules. Executing help with the name of
an available topic dis- plays a help message provided by the
corresponding plugin module and list of commands it
contains.</p>

<p>Plugin provided commands, as the name suggests,
originate from IPA plu- gin modules. The available set may
vary depending on your configuration and can be listed using
the built-in help command (see above).</p>

<p>Most plugin provided commands are tied to a certain type
of IPA object. IPA objects encompass common abstractions
such as users (user identi- ties/accounts), hosts (machine
identities), services, password poli- cies, etc. Commands
associated with an object are easily identified thanks to
the enforced naming convention; the command names are com-
posed of two parts separated with a dash: the name of the
corresponding IPA object type and the name of action
performed on it. For example all commands used to manage
user identities start with &quot;user-&quot; (e.g. user-add,
user-del).</p>

<p>The following actions are available for most IPA object
types:</p>

<p>add [PRIMARYKEY] [options] Create a new object.</p>

<p>show [PRIMARYKEY] [options] Display an existing
object.</p>

<p>mod [PRIMARYKEY] [options] Modify an existing
object.</p>

<p>del [PRIMARYKEY] Delete an existing object.</p>

<p>find [CRITERIA] [options] Search for existing
objects.</p>

<p>The above types of commands except find take the objects
primary key (e.g. user name for users) as their only
positional argument unless there can be only one object of
the given type. They can also take a number of options (some
of which might be required in the case of add) that
represent the objects attributes.</p>

<p>find commands take an optional criteria string as their
only positional argument. If present, all objects with an
attribute that contains the criteria string are displayed.
If an option representing an attribute is set, only object
with the attribute exactly matching the specified value are
displayed. Options with empty values are ignored. Without
parameters all objects of the corresponding type are
displayed.</p>

<p>For IPA objects with attributes that can contain
references to other objects (e.g. groups), the following
action are usually available:</p>

<p>add-member [PRIMARYKEY] [options] Add references to
other objects.</p>

<p>remove-member [PRIMARYKEY] [options] Remove references
to other objects.</p>

<p>The above types of commands take the objects primary key
as their only positional argument unless there can be only
one object of the given type. They also take a number of
options that represent lists of other object primary keys.
Each of these options represent one type of object.</p>

<p>For some types of objects, these commands might need to
take more than one primary key. This applies to IPA objects
organized in hierarchies where the parent object needs to be
identified first. Parent primary keys are always aligned to
the left (higher in the hierarchy = more to the left). For
example the automount IPA plugin enables users to manage
automount maps per location, as a result all automount
commands take an automountlocation primary key as their
first positional argument.</p>

<p>All commands that display objects have three special
options for con- trolling output:</p>

<p>--all Display all attributes. Without this option only
the most rele- vant attributes are displayed.</p>

<p>--raw Display objects as they are stored in the backing
store. Dis- ables formatting and attribute labels.</p>

<p>--rights Display effective rights on all attributes of
the entry. You also have to specify --all for this to work.
User rights are returned as Python dictionary where index is
the name of an attribute and value is a unicode string
composed (hence the u xxxx format) of letters specified
below. Note that user rights are primarily used for internal
purposes of CLI and WebUI.</p>

<p>r - read s - search w - write o - obliterate (delete) c
- compare W - self-write O - self-obliterate</p>

<p>EXAMPLES ipa help commands Display a list of available
commands ipa help topics Display a high-level list of help
topics ipa help user Display documenta- tion and list of
commands in the &quot;user&quot; topic.</p>

<p>ipa env List IPA environmental variables and their
values.</p>

<p>ipa user-add foo --first foo --last bar Create a new
user with username &quot;foo&quot;, first name
&quot;foo&quot; and last name &quot;bar&quot;.</p>

<p>ipa group-add bar --desc &quot;this is an example
group&quot; Create a new group with name &quot;bar&quot; and
description &quot;this is an example group&quot;.</p>

<p>ipa group-add-member bar --users=admin,foo Add users
&quot;admin&quot; and &quot;foo&quot; to the group
&quot;bar&quot;.</p>

<p>ipa user-show foo --raw Display user &quot;foo&quot; as
(s)he is stored on the server.</p>

<p>ipa group-show bar --all Display group &quot;bar&quot;
and all of its attributes.</p>

<p>ipa config-mod --maxusername 20 Set maximum user name
length to 20 characters.</p>

<p>ipa user-find foo Search for all users with
&quot;foo&quot; in either uid, first name, last name, full
name, etc. A user with uid &quot;foobar&quot; would match
the search criteria.</p>

<p>ipa user-find foo --first bar Same as the previous
example, except this time the users first name has to be
exactly &quot;bar&quot;. A user with uid &quot;foobar&quot;
and first name &quot;bar&quot; would match the search
criteria.</p>

<p>ipa user-find foo --first bar --last foo A user with uid
&quot;foobar&quot;, first name &quot;bar&quot; and last name
&quot;foo&quot; would match the search criteria.</p>

<p>ipa user-find --uuid
936407bd-da9b-11de-9abd-54520012e7cd Only the user with the
specified IPA unique ID would match the search criteria.</p>

<p>ipa user-find All users would match the search criteria
(as there are none).</p>

<p>SERVERS The ipa client will determine which server to
connect to in this order:</p>

<p>1. The server configured in /etc/ipa/default.conf in the
xmlrpc_uri directive.</p>

<p>2. An unordered list of servers from the ldap DNS SRV
records.</p>

<p>If a kerberos error is raised by any of the requests
then it will stop processing and display the error
message.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/ipa/default.conf IPA default configuration
file.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS 0 if the command was successful</p>

<p>1 if an error occurred</p>

<p>2 If an entry is not found</p>
