<p>SRP_RECONNECT_RPORT(9) SCSI mid layer
SRP_RECONNECT_RPORT(9)</p>

<p>NAME srp_reconnect_rport - reconnect to an SRP target
port</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS int srp_reconnect_rport(struct srp_rport *
rport);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS rport SRP target port.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Blocks SCSI command queueing before invoking
reconnect such that queuecommand won&acute;t be invoked
concurrently with reconnect from outside the SCSI EH. This
is important since a reconnect implementation may reallocate
resources needed by queuecommand.</p>

<p>NOTES - This function neither waits until outstanding
requests have finished nor tries to abort these. It is the
responsibility of the reconnect function to finish
outstanding commands before reconnecting to the target port.
- It is the responsibility of the caller to ensure that the
resources reallocated by the reconnect function won&acute;t
be used while this function is in progress. One possible
strategy is to invoke this function from the context of the
SCSI EH thread only. Another possible strategy is to lock
the rport mutex inside each SCSI LLD callback that can be
invoked by the SCSI EH (the scsi_host_template.eh_*()
functions and also the scsi_host_template.queuecommand
function).</p>
