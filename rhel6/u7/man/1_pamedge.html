<p>NAME pamedge - edge-detect an image</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pamedge [imagefile]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pamedge reads a Netpbm image (PNM or PAM) and produces
an image that outlines the edges.</p>

<p>The output image is of the same type as the input,
except that the max- val of the output is at least 255 and
if the input is PBM, the output is PGM.</p>

<p>You can pipe the result through pamditherbw -threshold
and play with the threshold value to get a PBM (bilevel
image) of the edges.</p>

<p>The edge detection technique used is to take the
Pythagorean sum of two Sobel gradient operators at 90
degrees to each other. For more details see Digital Image
Processing by Gonzalez and Wintz, chapter 7.</p>

<p>The maxval of the output is the same as the maxval of
the input, except at least 255. The effect is better with
larger maxvals, so you may want to increase the maxval of
the input by running it through pamdepth first.</p>

pnm(1)</p>

<p>HISTORY pamedge was added to Netpbm in Release 10.14
(March 2003). It replaced pgmedge, which was the same thing,
but worked only on PGM and PBM images.</p>
