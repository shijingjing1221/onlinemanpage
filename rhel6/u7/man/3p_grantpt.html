<p>GRANTPT(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual GRANTPT(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME grantpt - grant access to the slave pseudo-terminal
device</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</p>

<p>int grantpt(int fildes);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The grantpt() function shall change the mode
and ownership of the slave pseudo-terminal device associated
with its master pseudo-terminal coun- terpart. The fildes
argument is a file descriptor that refers to a mas- ter
pseudo-terminal device. The user ID of the slave shall be
set to the real UID of the calling process and the group ID
shall be set to an unspecified group ID. The permission mode
of the slave pseudo-terminal shall be set to readable and
writable by the owner, and writable by the group.</p>

<p>The behavior of the grantpt() function is unspecified if
the applica- tion has installed a signal handler to catch
SIGCHLD signals.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, grantpt() shall
return 0; otherwise, it shall return -1 and set errno to
indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The grantpt() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EBADF The fildes argument is not a valid open file
descriptor.</p>

<p>EINVAL The fildes argument is not associated with a
master pseudo-ter- minal device.</p>

<p>EACCES The corresponding slave pseudo-terminal device
could not be accessed.</p>
