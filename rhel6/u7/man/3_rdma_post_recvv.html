<p>RDMA_POST_RECVV(3) Librdmacm Programmer s Manual
RDMA_POST_RECVV(3)</p>

<p>NAME rdma_post_recvv - post a work request to receive
incoming messages.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;rdma/rdma_verbs.h&gt;</p>

<p>int rdma_post_recvv (struct rdma_cm_id *id, void
*context, struct ibv_sge *sgl, int nsge);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS id A reference to a communication identifier
where the message buffer(s) will be posted.</p>

<p>context User-defined context associated with the
request.</p>

<p>sgl A scatter-gather list of memory buffers posted as a
single request.</p>

<p>nsge The number of scatter-gather entries in the sgl
array.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Posts a single work request to the receive
queue of the queue pair associated with the rdma_cm_id. The
posted buffers will be queued to receive an incoming message
sent by the remote peer.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Returns 0 on success, or -1 on error. If an
error occurs, errno will be set to indicate the failure
reason.</p>

<p>NOTES The user is responsible for ensuring that the
receive is posted, and the total buffer space is large
enough to contain all sent data before the peer posts the
corresponding send message. The message buffers must have
been registered before being posted, and the buffers must
remain registered until the receive completes.</p>

<p>Messages may be posted to an rdma_cm_id only after a
queue pair has been associated with it. A queue pair is
bound to an rdma_cm_id after calling rdma_create_ep or
rdma_create_qp, if the rdma_cm_id is allo- cated using
rdma_create_id.</p>

<p>The user-defined context associated with the receive
request will be returned to the user through the work
completion wr_id, work request identifier, field.</p>
