<p>FGETWC(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual FGETWC(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME fgetwc - get a wide-character code from a
stream</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdio.h&gt; #include
&lt;wchar.h&gt;</p>

<p>wint_t fgetwc(FILE *stream);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The fgetwc() function shall obtain the next
character (if present) from the input stream pointed to by
stream, convert that to the correspond- ing wide-character
code, and advance the associated file position indi- cator
for the stream (if defined).</p>

<p>If an error occurs, the resulting value of the file
position indicator for the stream is unspecified.</p>

<p>The fgetwc() function may mark the st_atime field of the
file associ- ated with stream for update. The st_atime field
shall be marked for update by the first successful execution
of fgetc(), fgets(), fgetwc(), fgetws(), fread(), fscanf(),
getc(), getchar(), gets(), or scanf() using stream that
returns data not supplied by a prior call to ungetc() or
ungetwc().</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, the fgetwc()
function shall return the wide-character code of the
character read from the input stream pointed to by stream
converted to a type wint_t. If the stream is at end-of-
file, the end-of-file indicator for the stream shall be set
and fgetwc() shall return WEOF. If a read error occurs, the
error indicator for the stream shall be set, fgetwc() shall
return WEOF, and shall set errno to indicate the error. If
an encoding error occurs, the error indicator for the stream
shall be set, fgetwc() shall return WEOF, and shall set
errno to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The fgetwc() function shall fail if data needs to
be read and:</p>

<p>EAGAIN The O_NONBLOCK flag is set for the file
descriptor underlying stream and the process would be
delayed in the fgetwc() opera- tion.</p>

<p>EBADF The file descriptor underlying stream is not a
valid file descriptor open for reading.</p>

<p>EILSEQ The data obtained from the input stream does not
form a valid character.</p>

<p>EINTR The read operation was terminated due to the
receipt of a sig- nal, and no data was transferred.</p>

<p>EIO A physical I/O error has occurred, or the process is
in a back- ground process group attempting to read from its
controlling terminal, and either the process is ignoring or
blocking the SIGTTIN signal or the process group is
orphaned. This error may also be generated for
implementation-defined reasons.</p>

<p>EOVERFLOW The file is a regular file and an attempt was
made to read at or beyond the offset maximum associated with
the corresponding stream.</p>

<p>The fgetwc() function may fail if:</p>

<p>ENOMEM Insufficient storage space is available.</p>

<p>ENXIO A request was made of a nonexistent device, or the
request was outside the capabilities of the device.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The ferror() or feof() functions must
be used to distinguish between an error condition and an
end-of-file condition.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
