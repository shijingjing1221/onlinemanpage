<p>SMTP-SINK(1) SMTP-SINK(1)</p>

<p>NAME smtp-sink - multi-threaded SMTP/LMTP test
server</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS smtp-sink [options] [inet:][host]:port
backlog</p>

<p>smtp-sink [options] unix:pathname backlog</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION smtp-sink listens on the named host (or
address) and port. It takes SMTP messages from the network
and throws them away. The purpose is to measure client
performance, not protocol compliance.</p>

<p>smtp-sink may also be configured to capture each mail
delivery transac- tion to file. Since disk latencies are
large compared to network delays, this mode of operation can
reduce the maximal performance by several orders of
magnitude.</p>

<p>Connections can be accepted on IPv4 or IPv6 endpoints,
or on UNIX- domain sockets. IPv4 and IPv6 are the default.
This program is the complement of the smtp-source(1)
program.</p>

<p>Note: this is an unsupported test program. No attempt is
made to main- tain compatibility between successive
versions.</p>

<p>Arguments:</p>

<p>-4 Support IPv4 only. This option has no effect when
Postfix is built without IPv6 support.</p>

<p>-6 Support IPv6 only. This option is not available when
Postfix is built without IPv6 support.</p>

<p>-8 Do not announce 8BITMIME support.</p>

<p>-a Do not announce SASL authentication support.</p>

<p>-A delay Wait delay seconds after responding to DATA,
then abort prema- turely with a 550 reply status. Do not
read further input from the client; this is an attempt to
block the client before it sends &quot;.&quot;. Specify a
zero delay value to abort immediately.</p>

<p>-c Display running counters that are updated whenever an
SMTP ses- sion ends, a QUIT command is executed, or when
&quot;.&quot; is received.</p>

<p>-C Disable XCLIENT support.</p>

<p>-d dump-template Dump each mail transaction to a
single-message file whose name is created by expanding the
dump-template via strftime(3) and appending a pseudo-random
hexadecimal number (example: &quot;%Y%m%d%H/%M.&quot;
expands into &quot;2006081203/05.809a62e3&quot;). If the
template contains &quot;/&quot; characters, missing
directories are cre- ated automatically. The message dump
format is described below.</p>

<p>Note: this option keeps one capture file open for every
mail transaction in progress.</p>

<p>-D dump-template Append mail transactions to a
multi-message dump file whose name is created by expanding
the dump-template via strftime(3). If the template contains
&quot;/&quot; characters, missing directories are created
automatically. The message dump format is described
below.</p>

<p>Note: this option keeps one capture file open for every
mail transaction in progress.</p>

<p>-e Do not announce ESMTP support.</p>

<p>-E Do not announce ENHANCEDSTATUSCODES support.</p>

<p>-f command,command,... Reject the specified commands
with a hard (5xx) error code. This option implies -p.</p>

<p>Examples of commands are CONNECT, HELO, EHLO, LHLO,
MAIL, RCPT, VRFY, DATA, ., RSET, NOOP, and QUIT. Separate
command names by white space or commas, and use quotes to
protect white space from the shell. Command names are
case-insensitive.</p>

<p>-F Disable XFORWARD support.</p>

<p>-h hostname Use hostname in the SMTP greeting, in the
HELO response, and in the EHLO response. The default
hostname is &quot;smtp-sink&quot;.</p>

<p>-L Enable LMTP instead of SMTP.</p>

<p>-m count (default: 256) An upper bound on the maximal
number of simultaneous connections that smtp-sink will
handle. This prevents the process from run- ning out of file
descriptors. Excess connections will stay queued in the
TCP/IP stack.</p>

<p>-M count Terminate after receiving count messages.</p>

<p>-n count Terminate after count sessions.</p>

<p>-p Do not announce support for ESMTP command
pipelining.</p>

<p>-P Change the server greeting so that it appears to come
through a CISCO PIX system. Implies -e.</p>

<p>-q command,command,... Disconnect (without replying)
after receiving one of the speci- fied commands.</p>

<p>Examples of commands are CONNECT, HELO, EHLO, LHLO,
MAIL, RCPT, VRFY, DATA, ., RSET, NOOP, and QUIT. Separate
command names by white space or commas, and use quotes to
protect white space from the shell. Command names are
case-insensitive.</p>

<p>-Q command,command,... Send a 421 reply and disconnect
after receiving one of the spec- ified commands.</p>

<p>Examples of commands are CONNECT, HELO, EHLO, LHLO,
MAIL, RCPT, VRFY, DATA, ., RSET, NOOP, and QUIT. Separate
command names by white space or commas, and use quotes to
protect white space from the shell. Command names are
case-insensitive.</p>

<p>-r command,command,... Reject the specified commands
with a soft (4xx) error code. This option implies -p.</p>

<p>Examples of commands are CONNECT, HELO, EHLO, LHLO,
MAIL, RCPT, VRFY, DATA, ., RSET, NOOP, and QUIT. Separate
command names by white space or commas, and use quotes to
protect white space from the shell. Command names are
case-insensitive.</p>

<p>-R root-directory Change the process root directory to
the specified location. This option requires super-user
privileges. See also the -u option.</p>

<p>-s command,command,... Log the named commands to
syslogd.</p>

<p>Examples of commands are CONNECT, HELO, EHLO, LHLO,
MAIL, RCPT, VRFY, DATA, ., RSET, NOOP, and QUIT. Separate
command names by white space or commas, and use quotes to
protect white space from the shell. Command names are
case-insensitive.</p>

<p>-S start-string An optional string that is prepended to
each message that is written to a dump file (see the dump
file format description below). The following C escape
sequences are supported: (bell), (backslace), (formfeed),
(newline), (car- riage return), (horizontal tab), (vertical
tab), ddd (up to three octal digits) and \ (the backslash
character).</p>

<p>-t timeout (default: 100) Limit the time for receiving a
command or sending a response. The time limit is specified
in seconds.</p>

<p>-T windowsize Override the default TCP window size. To
work around broken TCP window scaling implementations,
specify a value &gt; 0 and &lt; 65536.</p>

<p>-u username Switch to the specified user privileges
after opening the net- work socket and optionally changing
the process root directory. This option is required when the
process runs with super-user privileges. See also the -R
option.</p>

<p>-v Show the SMTP conversations.</p>

<p>-w delay Wait delay seconds before responding to a DATA
command.</p>

<p>-W command:delay[:odds] Wait delay seconds before
responding to command. If odds is also specified (a number
between 1-99 inclusive), wait for a random multiple of
delay. The random multiplier is equal to the number of times
the program needs to roll a dice with a range of 0..99
inclusive, before the dice produces a result greater than or
equal to odds.</p>

<p>[inet:][host]:port Listen on network interface host
(default: any interface) TCP port port. Both host and port
may be specified in numeric or symbolic form.</p>

<p>unix:pathname Listen on the UNIX-domain socket at
pathname.</p>

<p>backlog The maximum length the queue of pending
connections, as defined by the listen(2) system call.</p>

<p>DUMP FILE FORMAT Each dumped message contains a sequence
of text lines, terminated with the newline character. The
sequence of information is as follows:</p>

<p>&middot; The optional string specified with the -S
option.</p>

<p>&middot; The smtp-sink generated headers as documented
below.</p>

<p>&middot; The message header and body as received from
the SMTP client.</p>

<p>&middot; An empty line.</p>

<p>The format of the smtp-sink generated headers is as
follows:</p>

<p>X-Client-Addr: text The client IP address without
enclosing []. An IPv6 address is prefixed with
&quot;ipv6:&quot;. This record is always present.</p>

<p>X-Client-Proto: text The client protocol: SMTP, ESMTP or
LMTP. This record is always present.</p>

<p>X-Helo-Args: text The arguments of the last HELO or EHLO
command before this mail delivery transaction. This record
is present only if the client sent a recognizable HELO or
EHLO command before the DATA com- mand.</p>

<p>X-Mail-Args: text The arguments of the MAIL command that
started this mail deliv- ery transaction. This record is
present exactly once.</p>

<p>X-Rcpt-Args: text The arguments of an RCPT command
within this mail delivery transaction. There is one record
for each RCPT command, and they are in the order as sent by
the client.</p>

<p>Received: text A message header for compatibility with
mail processing soft- ware. This three-line header marks the
end of the headers pro- vided by smtp-sink, and is formatted
as follows:</p>

<p>from helo ([addr]) The HELO or EHLO command argument and
client IP address. If the client did not send HELO or EHLO,
the client IP address is used instead.</p>

<p>by host (smtp-sink) with proto id random; The hostname
specified with the -h option, the client protocol (see
X-Client-Proto above), and the pseudo-ran- dom portion of
the per-message capture file name.</p>

<p>time-stamp A time stamp as defined in RFC 2822.</p>
