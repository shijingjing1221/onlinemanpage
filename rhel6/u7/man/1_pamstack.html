<p>NAME pamstack - stack planes of multiple PAM images into
one PAM image</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pamstack [-tupletype tupletype] [inputfilespec
...]</p>

<p>All options may be abbreviated to the shortest unique
prefix. You may use two hyphens instead of one. You may
separate an option from its value with a space instead of
=.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pamstack reads multiple PAM or PNM images as input and
produces a PAM image as output, consisting of all the planes
(channels) of the inputs, stacked in the order
specified.</p>

<p>For any one (but not more) of the input files, you may
specify - to mean Standard Input. If you specify no
arguments at all, the input is one file: Standard Input.</p>

<p>The output is the same dimensions as the inputs, except
that the depth is the sum of the depths of the inputs. It
has the same maxval. pam- stack fails if the inputs are not
all the same width, height, and max- val. The tuple type is
a null string unless you specify the -tupletype option.</p>

<p>pamstack works with multi-image streams. It stacks the
1st image in all the streams into one output image (the
first one in the output stream), then stacks the 2nd image
in all the streams into the 2nd image in the output stream,
and so on, until one of the streams runs dry. Its like a
matrix operation.</p>

<p>Before Netpbm 10.32 (February 2006), pamstack ignored
all but the first image in each input stream.</p>

<p>pamchannel does the opposite of pamstack: It extracts
individual planes from a single PAM.</p>

<p>Use pamtopnm(1)toconvertasuitablePAM image to a more
traditional PNM (PBM, PGM, or PPM) image. (But theres no
need to do that if youre going to feed it to a modern Netpbm
program -- they all take suitable PAM input directly).</p>

<p>One example of using pamstack is that some Netpbm
programs accept as input a PAM that represents graphic image
with transparency informa- tion. Taking a color image for
example, this would be a PAM with tuple type
&quot;RGB_ALPHA&quot;. In Netpbm, such images were
traditionally repre- sented as two images - a PPM for the
color and a PGM for the trans- parency. To convert a PPM/PGM
pair into PAM(RGB_ALPHA) input that newer programs require,
do something like this:</p>

<p>$ pamstack -tupletype=RGB_ALPHA myimage.ppm myalpha.pgm
| pamtouil &gt;myimage.uil</p>

<p>OPTIONS -tupletype tupletype This specifies the tuple
type name to be recorded in the output. You may use any
string up to 255 characters. Some programs recognize some
names. If you omit this option, the default tuple type name
is null.</p>
