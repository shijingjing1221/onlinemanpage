<p>AMTAPE(8) System Administration Commands AMTAPE(8)</p>

<p>NAME amtape - user interface to Amanda tape changer
controls</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS amtape config command [command_options...] [-o
configoption]...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Amtape performs tape changer control
operations. It uses the underlying tape changer script
defined by the tpchanger option for a particular Amanda
configuration as specified by the config argument.</p>

<p>Tape changers maintain a notion of the current and next
slot for each configuration. These may or may not correspond
to an actual physical state of the device, but do tend to
minimize searching through the tape storage slots. If the
desired tape is in the current slot, it is likely the next
tape needed is in the next slot rather than at some random
position in the storage slots.</p>

<p>See the amanda(8) man page for more details about
Amanda.</p>

<p>COMMANDS reset Reset the tape changer to a known state.
The current slot is set to the first slot. Other
device-specific side effects may occur. Some gravity
stackers need to be reset to the top position by hand. This
command notifies Amanda the stacker is back in that
position.</p>

<p>eject If a tape is loaded in the drive, it is ejected
and returned to the slot from which it was loaded.</p>

<p>clean If a cleaning tape is defined for the changer, it
is used to clean the drive.</p>

<p>show Show the contents of all slots. This can be
slow.</p>

<p>label label Search for and load the Amanda tape with
label label.</p>

<p>taper Perform the taper scan algorithm. Load the next
tape in the configuration&acute;s tape sequence, or a fresh
tape with a suitable label.</p>

<p>device Display the name of the current tape device on
stdout.</p>

<p>current Display the current slot.</p>

<p>update Update the changer label database, if it has one,
to match the tapes now available.</p>

<p>slot slot Eject any tape in the drive and put it away,
then load the tape from slot slot and reset current.</p>

<p>slot current Eject any tape in the drive and put it
away, then load the tape from the current slot.</p>

<p>slot next Eject any tape in the drive and put it away,
then load the tape from the next slot and reset current.</p>

<p>slot first Eject any tape in the drive and put it away,
then load the tape from the first slot and reset
current.</p>

<p>slot advance Synonym for slot next.</p>

<p>-o configoption See the &quot;CONFIGURATION
OVERRIDE&quot; section in amanda(8).</p>

<p>This is useful with non-gravity stackers to unload the
last tape used and set up Amanda for the next run. If you
just use eject, the current tape will be mounted again in
the next run, where it will be rejected as being still in
use, ejected and the next tape requested. Using slot next
followed by eject does an unnecessary mount.</p>

<p>Note: most changers optimize the slot commands to not
eject the loaded tape if it is the one being requested.</p>
