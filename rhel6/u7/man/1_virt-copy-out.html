<p>virt-copy-out(1) Virtualization Support
virt-copy-out(1)</p>

<p>NAME virt-copy-out - Copy files and directories out of a
virtual machine disk image.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS virt-copy-out -a disk.img /file|dir [/file|dir
...] localdir</p>

<p>virt-copy-out -d domain /file|dir [/file|dir ...]
localdir</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION &quot;virt-copy-out&quot; copies files and
directories out of a virtual machine disk image or named
libvirt domain.</p>

<p>You can give one of more filenames and directories on
the command line. Directories are copied out
recursively.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Download the home directories from a virtual
machine:</p>

<p>mkdir homes virt-copy-out -d MyGuest /home homes</p>

<p>JUST A SHELL SCRIPT WRAPPER AROUND GUESTFISH This
command is just a simple shell script wrapper around the
guestfish(1) &quot;copy-out&quot; command. For anything more
complex than a trivial copy, you are probably better off
using guestfish directly.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Since the shell script just passes options
straight to guestfish, read guestfish(1) to see the full
list of options.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO guestfish(1), virt-cat(1), virt-copy-in(1),
virt-edit(1), virt-tar-in(1), virt-tar-out(1),
