<p>NAME blkdiscard - discard sectors on a device</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS blkdiscard [-o offset] [-l length] [-s] [-v]
device</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION blkdiscard is used to discard device
sectors. This is useful for solid-state drivers (SSDs) and
thinly-provisioned storage. Unlike fstrim(8) this command is
used directly on the block device.</p>

<p>By default, blkdiscard will discard all blocks on the
device. Options may be used to modify this behavior based on
range or size, as explained below.</p>

<p>The device argument is the pathname of the block
device.</p>

<p>WARNING: All data in the discarded region on the device
will be lost!</p>

<p>OPTIONS The offset and length arguments may be followed
by the multiplicative suffixes KiB=1024, MiB=1024*1024, and
so on for GiB, TiB, PiB, EiB, ZiB and YiB (the
&quot;iB&quot; is optional, e.g., &quot;K&quot; has the same
meaning as &quot;KiB&quot;) or the suffixes KB=1000,
MB=1000*1000, and so on for GB, TB, PB, EB, ZB and YB.</p>

<p>-h, --help Print help and exit.</p>

<p>-o, --offset offset Byte offset in the device from which
to discard. Provided value will be aligned to the device
sector size. Default value is zero.</p>

<p>-l, --length length Number of bytes after starting point
to discard. Provided value will be aligned to the device
sector size. If the specified value extends past the end of
the device, blkdiscard will stop at the device size
boundary. Default value extends to the end of the
device.</p>

<p>-s, --secure Perform secure discard. Secure discard is
the same as regular discard except all copies of the
discarded blocks possibly cre- ated by garbage collection
must also be erased. It has to be supported by the
device.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose Print aligned offset and length
arguments.</p>
