<p>NAME udisks - udisks command line tool</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS udisks [OPTIONS]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION udisks is a simple command line client for
the udisks(7) system bus service.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --dump Dump all information about all devices.
Please include this when filing bugs.</p>

<p>--enumerate Lists all object paths of devices know to
the daemon.</p>

<p>--enumerate-device-files Lists all device files of
devices know to the daemon.</p>

<p>--monitor Connect to the daemon and print a line every
time an event happens.</p>

<p>--monitor-detail Like --monitor but prints the full
details of the device whenever an event happens.</p>

<p>--show-info device_file Shows information about
device_file.</p>

<p>--inhibit-polling device_file [-- program arg ...]
Inhibits polling on device_file. If no program is given,
polling is inhibited until Ctrl+C is pressed. Otherwise the
program is spawned and the polling is only inhibited until
the program terminates.</p>

<p>--poll-for-media device_file Polls device_file to
perform media detection.</p>

<p>--inhibit-all-polling [-- program arg ...] Inhibits
polling on all devices. If no program is given, polling is
inhibited until Ctrl+C is pressed. Otherwise the program is
spawned and the polling is only inhibited until the program
terminates.</p>

<p>--mount device_file [--mount-fstype fstype]
[--mount-options options] Mounts the device represented by
device_file using the file system fstype and a
comma-separated list of options.</p>

<p>--unmount device_file [--unmount-options options]
Unmounts the device represented by device_file using a
comma-separated list of options.</p>

<p>--detach device_file [--detach-options options] Detaches
(e.g. powering down the physical port the device is
connected to) the device represented by device_file using a
comma-separated list of options.</p>

<p>--ata-smart-refresh device_file [--ata-smart-wakeup]
Refreshes ATA SMART data for device_file. If the disk is
sleeping it will not be woken up unless --ata-smart-wakeup
is passed. will be used.</p>

<p>--ata-smart-refresh device_file --ata-smart-simulate
blob Read ATA SMART data from blob for device_file. This can
only be done by the super user and is typically used for
testing that clients relying on the ATA SMART data provided
by udisks behave correctly. The libatasmart git repository
at http://git.0pointer.de/?p=libatasmart.git;a=summary
contains a collection of blobs from failing disks.</p>

<p>--inhibit [-- program arg ...] Inhibits clients from
invoking methods on the daemon that require authorization
(all methods will return the
org.freedesktop.UDisks.Error.Inhibited error) if the caller
is not the super user. This is typically used by OS
installers and other programs that expects full control of
the system, specifically to avoid automounting devices. Only
the super user can do this.</p>

<p>If no program is given, the daemon is inhibited until
Ctrl+C is pressed. Otherwise the program is spawned and the
daemon is only inhibited until the program terminates.</p>

<p>--set-spindown device_file --spindown-timeout seconds
[-- program arg ...] Configures disk spindown timeout on
device_file to seconds. See the section called SPINNING DOWN
DISKS for important information before using this
option.</p>

<p>If no program is given, the spindown time will be used
until Ctrl+C is pressed. Otherwise the program is spawned
and the the spindown timeout will only be used until the
program terminates.</p>

<p>--set-spindown-all --spindown-timeout seconds [--
program arg ...] Configures disk spindown timeout on all
disks that can be spun down to seconds. See the section
called SPINNING DOWN DISKS for important information before
using this option.</p>

<p>If no program is given, the spindown time will be used
until Ctrl+C is pressed. Otherwise the program is spawned
and the the spindown timeout will only be used until the
program terminates.</p>

<p>--help Show help options.</p>

<p>SPINNING DOWN DISKS Caution should be exercised when
configuring disk spin down timeouts.</p>

<p>Note that every time a disk is spun down, the
start-stop-count ATA SMART attribute will increase by 1 and
most disks are only good for a limited number (typically
50,000 but it varies by manufacturer and model). In
addition, the drive may take as long as 30 seconds to
respond to subsequent disk access most drives are typically
faster, see the spin-up-time ATA SMART attribute.</p>

<p>On the other hand, cautious use (e.g. using conservative
timeouts) of the ability to spin down disks, can be a good
way to trade power consumption (typically 8 vs 1 Watts for
3.5&quot; drives) and heat emission for a slightly higher
latency.</p>
