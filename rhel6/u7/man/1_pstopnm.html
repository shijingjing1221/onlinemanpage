<p>OPTION USAGE Minimum unique abbreviation of option is
acceptable. You may use dou- ble hyphens instead of single
hyphen to denote options. You may use white space in place
of the equals sign to separate an option name from its
value.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pstopnm reads a PostScript file as input and produces
PBM, PGM, or PPM images as output. This program simply uses
GhostScript to render a PostScript file with its PNM device
drivers. If you dont have GhostScript installed or the
version you have installed was not built with the relevant
PNM device drivers, pstopnm will fail. You can see if you
have the proper environment by issuing the command gs --help
. If it responds and lists under Available Devices pbm,
pbmraw, pgm, pgmraw, pnm, pnmraw, ppm, or ppmraw, youre in
business.</p>

<p>pstopnm uses the value of the GHOSTSCRIPT environment
variable as the file name for the Ghostscript program. If
GHOSTSCRIPT is not set, pstopnm searches your PATH for a
regular file named gs. If it doesnt find one, it assumes
Ghostscript is in the file /usr/bin/gs.</p>

<p>pstopnm does not use the Netpbm libraries to generate
the output files, so may not be entirely consistent with
most Netpbm programs.</p>

<p>psfile[.ps] is the name of the input file. pstopnm will
add the ps to the end of the name you specify if no file
exists by the exact name you specify, but one with added
does. Use - to indicate Standard Input.</p>

<p>If you use the -stdout option, pstopnm outputs images of
all the pages as a multi-image file to Standard Output.
Otherwise, pstopnm creates one file for each page in the
Postscript document. The files are named as follows: If the
input file is named psfile.ps, the name of the files will be
psfile001.ppm, psfile002.ppm, etc. The filetype suffix is
.ppm, .pgm, or .pbm, depending on which kind of output you
choose with your invocation options. If the input file name
does not end in .ps, the whole file name is used in the
output file name. For example, if the input file is named
psfile.old, the output file name is psfile.old001.ppm,
etc.</p>

<p>Note that the output file selection is inconsistent with
most Netpbm programs, because it does not default to
Standard Output. This is for historical reasons, based on
the fact that the Netpbm formats did not always provide for
a sequence of images in a single file.</p>

<p>Each output image contains a rectangular area of the
page to which it pertains. See the Dimensions section for
details on what part of the input image goes into the output
image and how big it is in the output and what borders and
margins are in the output image.</p>

<p>It has been reported that on some Postscript Version 1
input, Ghostscript, and therefore pstopnm, produces no
output. To solve this problem, you can convert the file to
Postscript Version 3 with the pro- gram ps2ps. It is
reported that the program pstops does not work.</p>

<p>Dimensions This section describes what part of the input
image gets used in the output and the dimensions of the
output, including borders and back- ground.</p>

<p>Note that an output image is associated with a single
input page.</p>

<p>pstopnm starts by taking a rectangular area from the
input page. That is called the subject image.</p>

<p>pstopnm may add borders to the subject image to form
what is called the bordered subject image.</p>

<p>pstopnm places the bordered subject image in the center
of the output image and clips the edges as necessary to fit
the computed output image size.</p>

<p>The location of the subject image in the Postscript
input page is defined by four numbers, the lower left corner
and the upper right cor- ner x and y coordinates. These
coordinates are usually specified by the BoundingBox DSC
statement (a Postscript comment) in the PostScript file, but
they can be overridden by the user by specifying one or more
of the following options: -llx, -lly, -urx, and -ury.</p>

<p>The presence and thickness of a border to be added to
the subject image to form the bordered subject image is
controlled by the options -xbor- der and -yborder. If
pstopnm does not find a BoundingBox statement in the input,
and you dont specify image area coordinates on the command
line, pstopnm uses default values. If your input is from
Standard Input, pstopnm does not use the BoundingBox values
(due to the techni- cal difficulty of extracting that
information and still feeding the file to Ghostscript), so
you either have to specify the image area coordinates or
take the default.</p>

<p>The output image size is a confusing thing. In a
Postscript file, things have spatial dimensions. For
example, a particular line may be 3 centimeters long. A
Postscript printer is supposed to print the line 3
centimeters long, using however many pixels that takes,
without regard to how big the sheet of paper on which it is
printing is. In a PNM image, by contrast, there is no
spatial dimension; there are only pixels. You might have a
line that is 100 pixels long, but the PNM image says nothing
about how long that line should be on a printed page.</p>

<p>pstopnm fills the role of a Postscript printer. The PNM
image is a virtual printed page. pstopnm must determine how
many pixels it will use in the output image to represent an
inch of input image, which is the &quot;output device
resolution.&quot; Think of it as the number of dots per inch
the virtual printer prints on the virtual page.</p>

<p>The simplest thing is for you to tell pstopnm exactly
what output device resolution to use, using the -dpi option.
If you say for exam- ple -dpi=300 and the bordered subject
image is 2 inches by 2 inches, the PNM output will be 600
pixels by 600 pixels.</p>

<p>Or you can set the output image dimensions with -xsize
and -ysize. For example, if you say -xsize=1000 -ysize=1000
and the bordered subject image is 2 inches by 2 inches, the
output image is 1000 by 1000 pixels, with each pixel
representing 1/500 inch of input image.</p>

<p>If you specify one of -xsize and -ysize and not the
other, pstopnm defaults the other such that the output image
has the same aspect ratio as the bordered subject image.</p>

<p>If you specify neither the output size nor the output
device resolu- tion, pstopnm does some weird computation
which exists mainly for his- torical reasons:</p>

<p>If you specify -nocrop, pstopnm uses the values of -xmax
and -ymax for the output image dimensions. These default to
612 and 792 pixels, respectively.</p>

<p>The final case, the default, is where you dont specify
any size or resolution options of -nocrop. This is the most
complicated case. In this case, pstopnm first chooses an
output device resolution that would generate the number of
pixels indicated by -xmax and -ymax from the bordered
subject image. Then, based on that resolution, it chooses an
output image size that is just large enough to accomodate
the subject image (no borders). Remember (above) that
pstopnm trims the edges of the bordered subject image to fit
the computed output size.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -forceplain forces the output file to be in
plain (text) format. Other- wise, it is in raw (binary)
format. See pbm(1), etc.</p>

<p>-llx=bx selects bx as the lower left corner x coordinate
(in inches) on the Postscript input page of the subject
image. See the Dimen- sions section .</p>

<p>-lly=by selects by as the lower left corner y coordinate
(in inches) on the Postscript input page of the subject
image. See the Dimen- sions section .</p>

<p>-landscape renders the image in landscape
orientation.</p>

<p>-portrait renders the image in portrait orientation.</p>

<p>-nocrop This option causes pstopnm to make the output
image exactly the dimensions of the bordered subject image.
By default, pstopnm makes the output image the dimensions
specified by -xmax and -ymax. See the Dimensions section
.</p>

<p>-pbm</p>

<p>-pgm</p>

<p>-ppm selects the format of the output file. By default,
all files are rendered as PPM.</p>

<p>-stdout causes output to go to Standard Output instead
of to regular files, one per page (see description of output
files above). Use pnmsplit to extract individual pages from
Standard Output.</p>

<p>-urx=tx selects tx as the upper right corner x
coordinate (in inches) on the Postscript input page of the
subject image. See the Dimen- sions section .</p>

<p>-ury=ty selects ty as the upper right corner y
coordinate (in inches) on the Postscript input page of the
subject image. See the Dimen- sions section .</p>

<p>-verbose prints processing information to stdout.</p>

<p>-xborder=frac specifies that the left and right borders
added to the subject image are to be frac times the subject
image width. The default value is 0.1. See the Dimensions
section .</p>

<p>-xmax=xmax specifies that the output image is to be xmax
pixels wide. The default is 612. See the Dimensions section
.</p>

<p>-xsize=xsize specifies that the output image is to be
xsize pixels wide. See the Dimensions section .</p>

<p>-yborder=frac specifies that the top and bottom borders
added to the subject image are to be frac times the subject
image height. The default value is 0.1. See the Dimensions
section .</p>

<p>-ymax=ymax specifies that the output image is to be ymax
pixels high. The default is 792. See the Dimensions section
.</p>

<p>-ysize=ysize specifies that the output image is to be
ymax pixels high. See the Dimensions section .</p>

<p>-dpi=dpi specifies the output device resolution, in dots
per inch, of the Postscript printer that pstopnm simulates.
This is the number of PNM pixels pstopnm generates for each
inch of image. See the Dimensions section .</p>

<p>This option was new in Netpbm 10.21 (March 2004).</p>

<p>LIMITATIONS The program will produce incorrect results
with PostScript files that initialize the current
transformation matrix. In these cases, page translation and
rotation will not have any effect. To render these files,
probably the best bet is to use the following options:</p>

<p>pstopnm -xborder 0 -yborder 0 -portrait -nocrop
file.ps</p>

<p>Additional options may be needed if the document is
supposed to be ren- dered on a medium different from
letter-size paper.</p>
