<p>INTRO(2) Linux Programmer s Manual INTRO(2)</p>

<p>NAME intro - Introduction to system calls</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Section 2 of the manual describes the Linux
system calls. A system call is an entry point into the Linux
kernel. Usually, system calls are not invoked directly:
instead, most system calls have corresponding C library
wrapper functions which perform the steps required (e.g.,
trapping to kernel mode) in order to invoke the system call.
Thus, making a system call looks the same as invoking a
normal library func- tion.</p>

<p>For a list of the Linux system calls, see
syscalls(2).</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On error, most system calls return a
negative error number (i.e., the negated value of one of the
constants described in errno(3)). The C library wrapper
hides this detail from the caller: when a system call
returns a negative value, the wrapper copies the absolute
value into the errno variable, and returns -1 as the return
value of the wrapper.</p>

<p>The value returned by a successful system call depends
on the call. Many system calls return 0 on success, but some
can return non-zero values from a successful call. The
details are described in the indi- vidual manual pages.</p>

<p>In some cases, the programmer must define a feature test
macro in order to obtain the declaration of a system call
from the header file speci- fied in the man page SYNOPSIS
section. In such cases, the required macro is described in
the man page. For further information on feature test
macros, see feature_test_macros(7).</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO Certain terms and abbreviations are used
to indicate Unix variants and standards to which calls in
this section conform. See standards(7).</p>

<p>NOTES Calling Directly In most cases, it is unnecessary
to invoke a system call directly, but there are times when
the Standard C library does not implement a nice wrapper
function for you. In this case, the programmer must manually
invoke the system call using syscall(2). Historically, this
was also possible using one of the _syscall macros described
in _syscall(2).</p>

<p>Authors and Copyright Terms Look at the header of the
manual page source for the author(s) and copyright
conditions. Note that these can be different from page to
page!</p>
