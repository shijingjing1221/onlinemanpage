<p>AIO_READ(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual AIO_READ(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME aio_read - asynchronous read from a file
(REALTIME)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;aio.h&gt;</p>

<p>int aio_read(struct aiocb *aiocbp);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The aio_read() function shall read
aiocbp-&gt;aio_nbytes from the file associated with
aiocbp-&gt;aio_fildes into the buffer pointed to by
aiocbp-&gt;aio_buf. The function call shall return when the
read request has been initiated or queued to the file or
device (even when the data cannot be delivered
immediately).</p>

<p>If prioritized I/O is supported for this file, then the
asynchronous operation shall be submitted at a priority
equal to the scheduling pri- ority of the process minus
aiocbp-&gt;aio_reqprio.</p>

<p>The aiocbp value may be used as an argument to
aio_error() and aio_return() in order to determine the error
status and return status, respectively, of the asynchronous
operation while it is proceeding. If an error condition is
encountered during queuing, the function call shall return
without having initiated or queued the request. The
requested operation takes place at the absolute position in
the file as given by aio_offset, as if lseek() were called
immediately prior to the operation with an offset equal to
aio_offset and a whence equal to SEEK_SET. After a
successful call to enqueue an asynchronous I/O opera- tion,
the value of the file offset for the file is
unspecified.</p>

<p>The aiocbp-&gt;aio_lio_opcode field shall be ignored by
aio_read().</p>

<p>The aiocbp argument points to an aiocb structure. If the
buffer pointed to by aiocbp-&gt;aio_buf or the control block
pointed to by aiocbp becomes an illegal address prior to
asynchronous I/O completion, then the behavior is
undefined.</p>

<p>Simultaneous asynchronous operations using the same
aiocbp produce undefined results.</p>

<p>If synchronized I/O is enabled on the file associated
with aiocbp-&gt;aio_fildes, the behavior of this function
shall be according to the definitions of synchronized I/O
data integrity completion and syn- chronized I/O file
integrity completion.</p>

<p>For any system action that changes the process memory
space while an asynchronous I/O is outstanding to the
address range being changed, the result of that action is
undefined.</p>

<p>For regular files, no data transfer shall occur past the
offset maximum established in the open file description
associated with aiocbp-&gt;aio_fildes.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The aio_read() function shall return the
value zero to the calling pro- cess if the I/O operation is
successfully queued; otherwise, the function shall return
the value -1 and set errno to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The aio_read() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EAGAIN The requested asynchronous I/O operation was not
queued due to system resource limitations.</p>

<p>Each of the following conditions may be detected
synchronously at the time of the call to aio_read(), or
asynchronously. If any of the con- ditions below are
detected synchronously, the aio_read() function shall return
-1 and set errno to the corresponding value. If any of the
con- ditions below are detected asynchronously, the return
status of the asynchronous operation is set to -1, and the
error status of the asyn- chronous operation is set to the
corresponding value.</p>

<p>EBADF The aiocbp-&gt;aio_fildes argument is not a valid
file descriptor open for reading.</p>

<p>EINVAL The file offset value implied by
aiocbp-&gt;aio_offset would be invalid,
aiocbp-&gt;aio_reqprio is not a valid value, or
aiocbp-&gt;aio_nbytes is an invalid value.</p>

<p>In the case that the aio_read() successfully queues the
I/O operation but the operation is subsequently canceled or
encounters an error, the return status of the asynchronous
operation is one of the values nor- mally returned by the
read() function call. In addition, the error sta- tus of the
asynchronous operation is set to one of the error statuses
normally set by the read() function call, or one of the
following val- ues:</p>

<p>EBADF The aiocbp-&gt;aio_fildes argument is not a valid
file descriptor open for reading.</p>

<p>ECANCELED The requested I/O was canceled before the I/O
completed due to an explicit aio_cancel() request.</p>

<p>EINVAL The file offset value implied by
aiocbp-&gt;aio_offset would be invalid.</p>

<p>The following condition may be detected synchronously or
asyn- chronously:</p>

<p>EOVERFLOW The file is a regular file,
aiobcp-&gt;aio_nbytes is greater than 0, and the starting
offset in aiobcp-&gt;aio_offset is before the end-of-file
and is at or beyond the offset maximum in the open file
description associated with aiocbp-&gt;aio_fildes.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The aio_read() function is part of the
Asynchronous Input and Output option and need not be
available on all implementations.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
