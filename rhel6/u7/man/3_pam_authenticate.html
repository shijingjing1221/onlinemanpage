<p>PAM_AUTHENTICATE(3) Linux-PAM Manual
PAM_AUTHENTICATE(3)</p>

<p>NAME pam_authenticate - account authentication</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;security/pam_appl.h&gt;</p>

<p>int pam_authenticate(pam_handle_t *pamh, int flags);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pam_authenticate function is used to
authenticate the user. The user is required to provide an
authentication token depending upon the authentication
service, usually this is a password, but could also be a
finger print.</p>

<p>The PAM service module may request that the user enter
their username vio the the conversation mechanism (see
pam_start(3) and pam_conv(3)). The name of the authenticated
user will be present in the PAM item PAM_USER. This item may
be recovered with a call to pam_get_item(3).</p>

<p>The pamh argument is an authentication handle obtained
by a prior call to pam_start(). The flags argument is the
binary or of zero or more of the following values:</p>

<p>PAM_SILENT Do not emit any messages.</p>

<p>PAM_DISALLOW_NULL_AUTHTOK The PAM module service should
return PAM_AUTH_ERR if the user does not have a registered
authentication token.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUES PAM_ABORT The application should exit
immediately after calling pam_end(3) first.</p>

<p>PAM_AUTH_ERR The user was not authenticated.</p>

<p>PAM_CRED_INSUFFICIENT For some reason the application
does not have sufficient credentials to authenticate the
user.</p>

<p>PAM_AUTHINFO_UNVAIL The modules were not able to access
the authentication information. This might be due to a
network or hardware failure etc.</p>

<p>PAM_MAXTRIES One or more of the authentication modules
has reached its limit of tries authenticating the user. Do
not try again.</p>

<p>PAM_SUCCESS The user was successfully authenticated.</p>

<p>PAM_USER_UNKNOWN User unknown to authentication
service.</p>
