<p>XtCreateSelectionRequest(3) XT FUNCTIONS
XtCreateSelectionRequest(3)</p>

<p>NAME XtCreateSelectionRequest, XtSendSelectionRequest,
XtCancelSelection- Request - bundle multiple selection
conversion requests into a single request using MULTIPLE
target</p>

<p>SYNTAX void XtCreateSelectionRequest(Widget requestor,
Atom selection):</p>

<p>void XtSendSelectionRequest(Widget requestor, Atom
selection, Time time);</p>

<p>void XtCancelSelectionRequest(Widget requestor, Atom
selection);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS requestor Specifies the widget making the
request. Must be of class Core or a subclass thereof.</p>

<p>selection Specifies the particular selection
desired.</p>

<p>time Specifies the timestamp to be used in making the
request.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION When XtCreateSelectionRequest is called,
subsequent calls to XtGetSe- lectionValue and
XtGetSelectionValueIncremental with the requestor and
selection as specified to XtCreateSelectionRequest will be
bundled into a single selection conversion request with
multiple targets. The request is actually initiated by
calling XtSendSelectionRequest.</p>

<p>When XtSendSelectionRequest is called with a value of
requestor and selection matching a previous call to
XtCreateSelectionRequest, a selection conversion request is
actually sent to the selection owner. If a single target
request is queued, that request is made. If multiple targets
are queued they are bundled into a single request with the
tar- get MULTIPLE using the specified timestamp. As the
conversions are made, the callbacks associated with each
XtGetSelectionValue and XtGet- SelectionValueIncremental are
invoked in turn.</p>

<p>Multi-threaded applications should lock the application
context before calling XtCreateSelectionRequest and release
the lock after calling XtSendSelectionRequest to ensure that
the thread assembling the request is safe from interference
by another thread assembling a different request naming the
same widget and selection.</p>

<p>When XtCancelSelectionRequest is called, any requests
queued since the last call to XtCreateSelectionRequest are
cleaned up. Subsequent calls to XtGetSelectionValue,
XtGetSelectionValues, XtGetSelectionValueIncre- mental, and
XtGetSelectionValuesIncremental will not be deferred.</p>
