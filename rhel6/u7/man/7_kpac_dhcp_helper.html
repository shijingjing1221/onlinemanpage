<p>NAME kpac_dhcp_helper - provides Proxy Auto
Configuration to KDE</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS kpac_dhcp_helper</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Provides Proxy Auto Configuration to KDE by
requesting a JavaScript function that uses the requested URL
to determine the proxy settings. Locating that JavaScript
can be done by using DHCP or DNS.</p>

<p>DHCP is preferred for its flexibility over DNS, which
requires a wpad hostname or a fixed location to a script.
The only requirements for DHCP are a network that supports
DHCP and a current DHCP configuration. kpac_dhcp_helper is
the setuid application needed to support DHCP.</p>

<p>This tool is a support utility for KDE libraries and is
not called from the command line.</p>

<p>OPTIONS kpac_dhcp_helper takes no arguments.</p>

<p>SECURITY kpac_dhcp_helper must be used as setuid
root.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO resolver(3), dhclient(8), dhcpd(8),
named(8)</p>
