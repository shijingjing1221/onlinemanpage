<p>NAME pngtopnm - convert a PNG image into a PNM image</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pngtopnm [-verbose] [-alpha | -mix]
[-background=color] [-gamma=value] [-text=filename] [-time]
[pngfile]</p>

<p>Minimum unique abbreviation of option is acceptable. You
may use dou- ble hyphens instead of single hyphen to denote
options. You may use white space in place of the equals sign
to separate an option name from its value.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pngtopnm was obsoleted by
pngtopam(1),introducedwithNetpbm10.44 (September 2008).
pngtopam is backward compatible with pngtopnm, plus adds
many additional functions, including the ability to produce
a PAM image that includes an alpha (transparency)
channel.</p>

<p>Starting in Release 10.48, pngtopnm is just an alias for
pngtopam.</p>

<p>pngtopnm remained in the Netpbm package through Release
10.47 because it may have fewer bugs than pngtopam in those
releases, and may be faster in some environments. But
pngtopnm s incompatibility with the most current PNG
libraries makes it impractical to maintain along with
pngtopam now.</p>

<p>In releases before 10.48, you can use the pngtopam
documentation for pngtopnm, considering the following
differences:</p>

<p>&middot; pngtopnm options are a subset of pngtopams, as
documented above.</p>

<p>&middot; Any change that the pngtopam manual says
happened in or after Netpbm 10.44 doesnt apply to
pngtopnm.</p>
