<p>BLK_LLD_BUSY(9) Block Devices BLK_LLD_BUSY(9)</p>

<p>NAME blk_lld_busy - Check if underlying low-level
drivers of a device are busy</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS int blk_lld_busy(struct request_queue * q);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS q the queue of the device being checked</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Check if underlying low-level drivers of a
device are busy. If the drivers want to export their busy
state, they must set own exporting function using
blk_queue_lld_busy first.</p>

<p>Basically, this function is used only by request
stacking drivers to stop dispatching requests to underlying
devices when underlying devices are busy. This behavior
helps more I/O merging on the queue of the request stacking
driver and prevents I/O throughput regression on burst I/O
load.</p>

<p>RETURN 0 - Not busy (The request stacking driver should
dispatch request) 1 - Busy (The request stacking driver
should stop dispatching request)</p>
