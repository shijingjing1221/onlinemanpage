This manpage describes the program implementation of
readmult as shipped by the cdrkit distribution. See
http://alioth.debian.org/projects/debburn/ for details. It
is a spinoff from the original program distributed by the
cdrtools project. However, the cdrtools developers are not
involved in the development of this spinoff and therefore

it. Do not try to get support for this program by contacting
the original authors.</p>
