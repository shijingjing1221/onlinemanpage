<p>LIBIEEE1284(3) Introduction LIBIEEE1284(3)</p>

<p>NAME libieee1284 - IEEE1284 communications library</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;ieee1284.h&gt; cc files...
-lieee1284</p>

<p>OVERVIEW The libieee1284 library is a library for
accessing parallel port devices.</p>

<p>The model presented to the user is fairly abstract: a
list of parallel ports with arbitrary names, with functions
to access them in various ways ranging from bit operations
to block data transfer in one of the IEEE 1284 sanctioned
protocols.</p>

<p>Although the library resides in user space the speed
penalty may not be as bad as you initially think, since the
operating system may well provide assistance with block data
transfer operations; in fact, the operating system may even
use hardware assistance to get the job done. So, using
libieee1284, ECP transfers using DMA are possible.</p>

<p>The normal sequence of events will be that the
application</p>

<p>1. calls ieee1284_find_ports to get a list of available
ports</p>

<p>2. then ieee1284_get_deviceid to look for a device on
each port that it is interested in</p>

<p>3. and then ieee1284_open to open each port it finds a
device it can control on.</p>

<p>4. The list of ports returned from ieee1284_find_ports
can now be disposed of using ieee1284_free_ports.</p>

<p>5. Then when it wants to control the device, it will
call ieee1284_claim to prevent other drivers from using the
port</p>

<p>6. then perhaps do some data transfers</p>

<p>7. and then ieee1284_release when it is finished that
that particular command. This claim-control-release sequence
will be repeated each time it wants to tell the device to do
something.</p>

<p>8. Finally when the application is finished with the
device it will call ieee1284_close.</p>

<p>Usually a port needs to be claimed before it can be
used. This is to prevent multiple drivers from trampling on
each other if they both want to use the same port. The
exception to this rule is the collection of IEEE 1284 Device
IDs, which has an implicit open-claim-release-close
sequence. The reason for this is that it may be possible to
collect a Device ID from the operating system, without
bothering the device with it.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION When ieee1284_find_ports is first called,
the library will look for a configuration file,
/etc/ieee1284.conf.</p>

<p>Comments begin with a &acute;#&acute; character and
extend to the end of the line. Everything else is
freely-formatted tokens. A non-quoted (or double-quoted)
backslash character &acute;&acute; preserves the literal
value of the next character, and single and double quotes
may be used for preserving white-space. Braces and equals
signs are recognised as tokens, unless quoted or
escaped.</p>

<p>The only configuration instruction that is currently
recognised is disallow method ppdev, for preventing the use
of the Linux ppdev driver.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT You can enable debugging output from the
library by setting the environment variable
LIBIEEE1284_DEBUG to any value.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/ieee1284.conf Configuration file.</p>
