<p>GPG-AGENT(1) GNU Privacy Guard GPG-AGENT(1)</p>

<p>NAME gpg-agent - Secret key management for GnuPG</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS gpg-agent [--homedir dir] [--options file]
[options] gpg-agent [--homedir dir] [--options file]
[options] --server gpg-agent [--homedir dir] [--options
file] [options] --daemon [com- mand_line]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION gpg-agent is a daemon to manage secret
(private) keys independently from any protocol. It is used
as a backend for gpg and gpgsm as well as for a couple of
other utilities.</p>

<p>The usual way to run the agent is from the ~/.xsession
file:</p>

<p>eval $(gpg-agent --daemon)</p>

<p>If you don t use an X server, you can also put this into
your regular startup file ~/.profile or .bash_profile. It is
best not to run multi- ple instance of the gpg-agent, so you
should make sure that only one is running: gpg-agent uses an
environment variable to inform clients about the
communication parameters. You can write the content of this
envi- ronment variable to a file so that you can test for a
running agent. Here is an example using Bourne shell
syntax:</p>

<p>gpg-agent --daemon --enable-ssh-support --write-env-file
&quot;${HOME}/.gpg-agent-info&quot;</p>

<p>This code should only be run once per user session to
initially fire up the agent. In the example the optional
support for the included Secure Shell agent is enabled and
the information about the agent is written to a file in the
HOME directory. Note that by running gpg-agent with- out
arguments you may test whether an agent is already running;
however such a test may lead to a race condition, thus it is
not suggested.</p>

<p>The second script needs to be run for each interactive
session:</p>

<p>if [ -f &quot;${HOME}/.gpg-agent-info&quot; ]; then .
&quot;${HOME}/.gpg-agent-info&quot; export GPG_AGENT_INFO
export SSH_AUTH_SOCK export SSH_AGENT_PID fi</p>

<p>It reads the data out of the file and exports the
variables. If you dont use Secure Shell, you dont need the
last two export statements.</p>

<p>You should always add the following lines to your
.bashrc or whatever initialization file is used for all
shell invocations:</p>

<p>GPG_TTY=$(tty) export GPG_TTY</p>

<p>It is important that this environment variable always
reflects the output of the tty command. For W32 systems this
option is not required.</p>

<p>Please make sure that a proper pinentry program has been
installed under the default filename (which is system
dependant) or use the option pinentry-program to specify the
full name of that program. It is often useful to install a
symbolic link from the actual used pinen- try (e.g.
/usr/bin/pinentry-gtk) to the expected one (e.g.
/usr/bin/pinentry).</p>

<p>COMMANDS Commands are not distinguished from options
except for the fact that only one command is allowed.</p>

<p>--version Print the program version and licensing
information. Not that you can abbreviate this command.</p>

<p>--help</p>

<p>-h Print a usage message summarizing the most useful
command-line options. Not that you can abbreviate this
command.</p>

<p>--dump-options Print a list of all available options and
commands. Not that you can abbreviate this command.</p>

<p>--server Run in server mode and wait for commands on the
stdin. The default mode is to create a socket and listen for
commands there.</p>

<p>--daemon [command line] Start the gpg-agent as a daemon;
that is, detach it from the console and run it in the
background. Because gpg-agent prints out important
information required for further use, a common way of
invoking gpg-agent is: eval $(gpg-agent --daemon) to setup
the environment variables. The option --write-env-file is
another way commonly used to do this. Yet another way is
creat- ing a new process as a child of gpg-agent: gpg-agent
--daemon /bin/sh. This way you get a new shell with the
environment setup properly; if you exit from this shell,
gpg-agent termi- nates as well.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --options file Reads configuration from file
instead of from the default per- user configuration file.
The default configuration file is named gpg-agent.conf and
expected in the .gnupg directory directly below the home
directory of the user.</p>

<p>--homedir dir Set the name of the home directory to dir.
If this option is not used, the home directory defaults to
~/.gnupg. It is only recognized when given on the command
line. It also overrides any home directory stated through
the environment variable GNUPGHOME or (on W32 systems) by
means of the Registry entry
HKCUSoftwareGNUGnuPG:HomeDir.</p>

<p>-v</p>

<p>--verbose Outputs additional information while running.
You can increase the verbosity by giving several verbose
commands to gpgsm, such as &rsquo;-vv&rsquo;.</p>

<p>-q</p>

<p>--quiet Try to be as quiet as possible.</p>

<p>--batch Don t invoke a pinentry or do any other thing
requiring human interaction.</p>

<p>--faked-system-time epoch This option is only useful for
testing; it sets the system time back or forth to epoch
which is the number of seconds elapsed since the year
1970.</p>

<p>--debug-level level Select the debug level for
investigating problems. level may be a numeric value or a
keyword:</p>

<p>none No debugging at all. A value of less than 1 may be
used instead of the keyword.</p>

<p>basic Some basic debug messages. A value between 1 and 2
may be used instead of the keyword.</p>

<p>advanced More verbose debug messages. A value between 3
and 5 may be used instead of the keyword.</p>

<p>expert Even more detailed messages. A value between 6
and 8 may be used instead of the keyword.</p>

<p>guru All of the debug messages you can get. A value
greater than 8 may be used instead of the keyword. The
creation of hash tracing files is only enabled if the
keyword is used.</p>

<p>How these messages are mapped to the actual debugging
flags is not specified and may change with newer releases of
this program. They are however carefully selected to best
aid in debugging.</p>

<p>--debug flags This option is only useful for debugging
and the behaviour may change at any time without notice.
FLAGS are bit encoded and may be given in usual C-Syntax.
The currently defined bits are:</p>

<p>0 (1) X.509 or OpenPGP protocol related data</p>

<p>1 (2) values of big number integers</p>

<p>2 (4) low level crypto operations</p>

<p>5 (32) memory allocation</p>

<p>6 (64) caching</p>

<p>7 (128) show memory statistics.</p>

<p>9 (512) write hashed data to files named dbgmd-000*</p>

<p>10 (1024) trace Assuan protocol</p>

<p>12 (4096) bypass all certificate validation</p>

<p>--debug-all Same as --debug=0xffffffff</p>

<p>--debug-wait n When running in server mode, wait n
seconds before entering the actual processing loop and print
the pid. This gives time to attach a debugger.</p>

<p>--no-detach Dont detach the process from the console.
This is mainly use- ful for debugging.</p>

<p>-s</p>

<p>--sh</p>

<p>-c</p>

<p>--csh Format the info output in daemon mode for use with
the standard Bourne shell or the C-shell respectively. The
default is to guess it based on the environment variable
SHELL which is cor- rect in almost all cases.</p>

<p>--write-env-file file Often it is required to connect to
the agent from a process not being an inferior of gpg-agent
and thus the environment variable with the socket name is
not available. To help setting up those variables in other
sessions, this option may be used to write the information
into file. If file is not specified the default name
${HOME}/.gpg-agent-info will be used. The format is suitable
to be evaluated by a Bourne shell like in this simple
example:</p>

<p>eval $(cat file) eval $(cut -d= -f 1 &lt; file | xargs
echo export)</p>

<p>--no-grab Tell the pinentry not to grab the keyboard and
mouse. This option should in general not be used to avoid
X-sniffing attacks.</p>

<p>--log-file file Append all logging output to file. This
is very helpful in see- ing what the agent actually
does.</p>

<p>--allow-mark-trusted Allow clients to mark keys as
trusted, i.e. put them into the trustlist.txt file. This is
by default not allowed to make it harder for users to
inadvertently accept Root-CA keys.</p>

<p>--ignore-cache-for-signing This option will let
gpg-agent bypass the passphrase cache for all signing
operation. Note that there is also a per-session option to
control this behaviour but this command line option takes
precedence.</p>

<p>--default-cache-ttl n Set the time a cache entry is
valid to n seconds. The default is 600 seconds.</p>

<p>--default-cache-ttl-ssh n Set the time a cache entry
used for SSH keys is valid to n sec- onds. The default is
1800 seconds.</p>

<p>--max-cache-ttl n Set the maximum time a cache entry is
valid to n seconds. After this time a cache entry will be
expired even if it has been accessed recently. The default
is 2 hours (7200 seconds).</p>

<p>--max-cache-ttl-ssh n Set the maximum time a cache entry
used for SSH keys is valid to n seconds. After this time a
cache entry will be expired even if it has been accessed
recently. The default is 2 hours (7200 seconds).</p>

<p>--enforce-passphrase-constraints Enforce the passphrase
constraints by not allowing the user to bypass them using
the Take it anyway button.</p>

<p>--min-passphrase-len n Set the minimal length of a
passphrase. When entering a new passphrase shorter than this
value a warning will be displayed. Defaults to 8.</p>

<p>--min-passphrase-nonalpha n Set the minimal number of
digits or special characters required in a passphrase. When
entering a new passphrase with less than this number of
digits or special characters a warning will be displayed.
Defaults to 1.</p>

<p>--check-passphrase-pattern file Check the passphrase
against the pattern given in file. When entering a new
passphrase matching one of these pattern a warn- ing will be
displayed. file should be an absolute filename. The default
is not to use any pattern file.</p>

<p>Security note: It is known that checking a passphrase
against a list of pattern or even against a complete
dictionary is not very effective to enforce good
passphrases. Users will soon figure up ways to bypass such a
policy. A better policy is to educate users on good security
behavior and optionally to run a passphrase cracker
regularly on all users passphrases to catch the very simple
ones.</p>

<p>--max-passphrase-days n Ask the user to change the
passphrase if n days have passed since the last change. With
--enforce-passphrase-constraints set the user may not bypass
this check.</p>

<p>--enable-passphrase-history This option does nothing
yet.</p>

<p>--pinentry-program filename Use program filename as the
PIN entry. The default is installa- tion dependent and can
be shown with the --version command.</p>

<p>--pinentry-touch-file filename By default the filename
of the socket gpg-agent is listening for requests is passed
to Pinentry, so that it can touch that file before exiting
(it does this only in curses mode). This option changes the
file passed to Pinentry to filename. The special name
/dev/null may be used to completely disable this feature.
Note that Pinentry will not create that file, it will only
change the modification and access time.</p>

<p>--scdaemon-program filename Use program filename as the
Smartcard daemon. The default is installation dependent and
can be shown with the --version com- mand.</p>

<p>--disable-scdaemon Do not make use of the scdaemon tool.
This option has the effect of disabling the ability to do
smartcard operations. Note, that enabling this option at
runtime does not kill an already forked scdaemon.</p>

<p>--use-standard-socket</p>

<p>--no-use-standard-socket By enabling this option
gpg-agent will listen on the socket named S.gpg-agent,
located in the home directory, and not cre- ate a random
socket below a temporary directory. Tools connect- ing to
gpg-agent should first try to connect to the socket given in
environment variable GPG_AGENT_INFO and then fall back to
this socket. This option may not be used if the home
directory is mounted as a remote file system. Note, that
--use-standard- socket is the default on Windows
systems.</p>

<p>--display string</p>

<p>--ttyname string</p>

<p>--ttytype string</p>

<p>--lc-ctype string</p>

<p>--lc-messages string</p>

<p>--xauthority string These options are used with the
server mode to pass localization information.</p>

<p>--keep-tty</p>

<p>--keep-display Ignore requests to change the current tty
or X window systems DISPLAY variable respectively. This is
useful to lock the pinentry to pop up at the tty or display
you started the agent.</p>

<p>--enable-ssh-support</p>

<p>Enable emulation of the OpenSSH Agent protocol.</p>

<p>In this mode of operation, the agent does not only
implement the gpg-agent protocol, but also the agent
protocol used by OpenSSH (through a separate socket).
Consequently, it should be possi- ble to use the gpg-agent
as a drop-in replacement for the well known ssh-agent.</p>

<p>SSH Keys, which are to be used through the agent, need
to be added to the gpg-agent initially through the ssh-add
utility. When a key is added, ssh-add will ask for the
password of the provided key file and send the unprotected
key material to the agent; this causes the gpg-agent to ask
for a passphrase, which is to be used for encrypting the
newly received key and storing it in a gpg-agent specific
directory.</p>

<p>Once a key has been added to the gpg-agent this way, the
gpg- agent will be ready to use the key.</p>

<p>Note: in case the gpg-agent receives a signature
request, the user might need to be prompted for a
passphrase, which is neces- sary for decrypting the stored
key. Since the ssh-agent proto- col does not contain a
mechanism for telling the agent on which display/terminal it
is running, gpg-agent s ssh-support will use the TTY or X
display where gpg-agent has been started. To switch this
display to the current one, the following command may be
used:</p>

<p>echo UPDATESTARTUPTTY | gpg-connect-agent</p>

<p>All the long options may also be given in the
configuration file after stripping off the two leading
dashes.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES The usual way to invoke gpg-agent is</p>

<p>$ eval $(gpg-agent --daemon)</p>

<p>An alternative way is by replacing ssh-agent with
gpg-agent. If for example ssh-agent is started as part of
the Xsession initialization, you may simply replace
ssh-agent by a script like:</p>

<p>#!/bin/sh</p>

<p>exec /usr/local/bin/gpg-agent --enable-ssh-support
--daemon --write-env-file ${HOME}/.gpg-agent-info
&quot;$@&quot;</p>

<p>and add something like (for Bourne shells)</p>

<p>if [ -f &quot;${HOME}/.gpg-agent-info&quot; ]; then .
&quot;${HOME}/.gpg-agent-info&quot; export GPG_AGENT_INFO
export SSH_AUTH_SOCK export SSH_AGENT_PID fi</p>

<p>to your shell initialization file (e.g. ~/.bashrc).</p>

<p>FILES There are a few configuration files needed for the
operation of the agent. By default they may all be found in
the current home directory (see: [option --homedir]).</p>

<p>gpg-agent.conf This is the standard configuration file
read by gpg-agent on startup. It may contain any valid long
option; the leading two dashes may not be entered and the
option may not be abbre- viated. This file is also read
after a SIGHUP however only a few options will actually have
an effect. This default name may be changed on the command
line (see: [option --options]). You should backup this
file.</p>

<p>trustlist.txt This is the list of trusted keys. You
should backup this file.</p>

<p>Comment lines, indicated by a leading hash mark, as well
as empty lines are ignored. To mark a key as trusted you
need to enter its fingerprint followed by a space and a
capital letter S. Colons may optionally be used to separate
the bytes of a fingerprint; this allows to cut and paste the
fingerprint from a key listing output. If the line is
prefixed with a ! the key is explicitly marked as not
trusted.</p>

<p>Here is an example where two keys are marked as
ultimately trusted and one as not trusted:</p>

<p>.RS 2 # CN=Wurzel ZS 3,O=Intevation GmbH,C=DE
A6935DD34EF3087973C706FC311AA2CCF733765B S</p>

<p># CN=PCA-1-Verwaltung-02/O=PKI-1-Verwaltung/C=DE
DC:BD:69:25:48:BD:BB:7E:31:6E:BB:80:D3:00:80:35:D4:F8:A6:CD
S</p>

<p># CN=Root-CA/O=Schlapphuete/L=Pullach/C=DE
!14:56:98:D3:FE:9C:CA:5A:31:6E:BC:81:D3:11:4E:00:90:A3:44:C2
S .fi</p>

<p>Before entering a key into this file, you need to ensure
its authenticity. How to do this depends on your
organisation; your administrator might have already entered
those keys which are deemed trustworthy enough into this
file. Places where to look for the fingerprint of a root
certificate are letters received from the CA or the website
of the CA (after making 100% sure that this is indeed the
website of that CA). You may want to consider allowing
interactive updates of this file by using the see: [option
--allow-mark-trusted]. This is however not as secure as
maintaining this file manually. It is even advisable to
change the permissions to read-only so that this file cant
be changed inadvertently.</p>

<p>As a special feature a line include-default will include
a global list of trusted certificates (e.g.
/etc/gnupg/trustlist.txt). This global list is also used if
the local list is not available.</p>

<p>It is possible to add further flags after the S for use
by the caller:</p>

<p>relax Relax checking of some root certificate
requirements. This is for example required if the
certificate is missing the basicConstraints attribute
(despite that it is a MUST for CA certificates).</p>

<p>cm If validation of a certificate finally issued by a CA
with this flag set fails, try again using the chain
validation model.</p>

<p>sshcontrol</p>

<p>This file is used when support for the secure shell
agent protocol has been enabled (see: [option
--enable-ssh-support]). Only keys present in this file are
used in the SSH protocol. You should backup this file.</p>

<p>The ssh-add tool may be used to add new entries to this
file; you may also add them manually. Comment lines,
indicated by a leading hash mark, as well as empty lines are
ignored. An entry starts with optional whitespace, followed
by the keygrip of the key given as 40 hex digits, optionally
followed by the caching TTL in seconds and another optional
field for arbitrary flags. A non-zero TTL overrides the
global default as set by --default-cache-ttl-ssh.</p>

<p>The keygrip may be prefixed with a ! to disable an entry
entry.</p>

<p>The following example lists exactly one key. Note that
keys available through a OpenPGP smartcard in the active
smartcard reader are implicitly added to this list; i.e.
there is no need to list them.</p>

<p>.RS 2 # Key added on 2005-02-25 15:08:29
5A6592BF45DC73BD876874A28FD4639282E29B52 0 .fi</p>

<p>private-keys-v1.d/</p>

<p>This is the directory where gpg-agent stores the private
keys. Each key is stored in a file with the name made up of
the keygrip and the suffix key. You should backup all files
in this directory and take great care to keep this backup
closed away.</p>

<p>Note that on larger installations, it is useful to put
predefined files into the directory /etc/skel/.gnupg/ so
that newly created users start up with a working
configuration. For existing users the a small helper script
is provided to create these files (see: [addgnupghome]).</p>

<p>SIGNALS A running gpg-agent may be controlled by
signals, i.e. using the kill command to send a signal to the
process.</p>

<p>Here is a list of supported signals:</p>

<p>SIGHUP This signal flushes all cached passphrases and if
the program has been started with a configuration file, the
configuration file is read again. Only certain options are
honored: quiet, verbose, debug, debug-all, debug-level,
no-grab, pinentry-pro- gram, default-cache-ttl,
max-cache-ttl, ignore-cache-for-sign- ing,
allow-mark-trusted and disable-scdaemon. scdaemon-program is
also supported but due to the current implementation, which
calls the scdaemon only once, it is not of much use unless
you manually kill the scdaemon.</p>

<p>SIGTERM Shuts down the process but waits until all
current requests are fulfilled. If the process has received
3 of these signals and requests are still pending, a
shutdown is forced.</p>

<p>SIGINT Shuts down the process immediately.</p>

<p>SIGUSR1 Dump internal information to the log file.</p>

<p>SIGUSR2 This signal is used for internal purposes.</p>

scdaemon(1)</p>

<p>The full documentation for this tool is maintained as a
Texinfo manual. If GnuPG and the info program are properly
installed at your site, the command</p>

<p>info gnupg</p>

<p>should give you access to the complete manual including
a menu struc- ture and an index.</p>
