<p>NAME ppmtomitsu - convert a PPM image to a Mitsubishi
S340-10 file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ppmtomitsu</p>

<p>[-sharpness val]</p>

<p>[-enlarge val]</p>

<p>[-media string]</p>

<p>[-copy val]</p>

<p>[-dpi300]</p>

<p>[-tiny]</p>

<p>[ppmfile]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>ppmtomitsu reads a PPM image as input and converts it
into a format suitable to be printed by a Mitsubishi S340-10
printer, or any other Mitsubishi color sublimation
printer.</p>

<p>The Mitsubishi S340-10 Color Sublimation printer
supports 24bit color. Images of the available sizes take so
long to transfer that there is a fast method, employing a
lookuptable, that ppmtomitsu will use if there is a maximum
of 256 colors in the image. ppmtomitsu will try to posi-
tion your image to the center of the paper, and will rotate
your image for you if xsize is larger than ysize. If your
image is larger than the media allows, ppmtomitsu will quit
with an error message. (We decided that the media were too
expensive to have careless users pro- duce misprints.) Once
data transmission has started, the job cant be stopped in a
sane way without resetting the printer. The printer
understands putting together images in the printers memory;
ppmtomitsu doesnt utilize this as pnmcat etc provide the
same functionality and let you view the result on-screen,
too. The S340-10 is the lowest com- mon denominator printer;
for higher resolution printers theres the dpi300 option. The
other printers also support higher values for enlarge eg,
but I dont think thats essential enough to warrant a change
in the program.</p>

<p>For proper results, the input maxval must be 255. Use
pamdepth to ensure that it is.</p>

<p>Before Netpbm 10.40 (September 2007), all Netpbm PPM
programs, includ- ing ppmtomitsu, see a PBM image as having
maxval 1, so ppmtomitsu does not function properly with PBM
input. You can use ppmtoppm together with pamdepth to turn
your PBM input into maxval 255 PPM input that ppmtomitsu
will use properly.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -sharpness 1-4 sharpness designation. Default is
to use the current sharp- ness.</p>

<p>-enlarge 1-3 Enlarge by a factor; Default is 1 (no
enlarge)</p>

<p>-media {A|A4|AS|A4S} Designate the media youre using.
Default is 1184 x 1350, which will fit on any media. A is
1216 x 1350, A4 is 1184 x 1452, AS is 1216 x 1650 and A4S is
1184 x 1754. A warning: If you spec- ify a different media
than the printer currently has, the printer will wait until
you put in the correct media or switch it off.</p>

<p>-copy 1-9 The number of copies to produce. Default is
1.</p>

<p>-dpi300 Double the number of allowed pixels for a
S3600-30 Printer in S340-10 compatibility mode. (The
S3600-30 has 300 dpi).</p>

<p>-tiny Memory-saving, but always slow. The printer will
get the data line-by-line in 24bit. Its probably a good idea
to use this if your machine starts paging a lot without this
option.</p>
