<p>CTERMID(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual CTERMID(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME ctermid - generate a pathname for the controlling
terminal</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</p>

<p>char *ctermid(char *s);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The ctermid() function shall generate a
string that, when used as a pathname, refers to the current
controlling terminal for the current process. If ctermid()
returns a pathname, access to the file is not
guaranteed.</p>

<p>If the application uses any of the
_POSIX_THREAD_SAFE_FUNCTIONS or _POSIX_THREADS functions, it
shall ensure that the ctermid() function is called with a
non-NULL parameter.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE If s is a null pointer, the string shall be
generated in an area that may be static (and therefore may
be overwritten by each call), the address of which shall be
returned. Otherwise, s is assumed to point to a character
array of at least L_ctermid bytes; the string is placed in
this array and the value of s shall be returned. The
symbolic constant L_ctermid is defined in &lt;stdio.h&gt;,
and shall have a value greater than 0.</p>

<p>The ctermid() function shall return an empty string if
the pathname that would refer to the controlling terminal
cannot be determined, or if the function is
unsuccessful.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Determining the Controlling Terminal for the
Current Process The following example returns a pointer to a
string that identifies the controlling terminal for the
current process. The pathname for the ter- minal is stored
in the array pointed to by the ptr argument, which has a
size of L_ctermid bytes, as indicated by the term
argument.</p>

<p>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; ... char term[L_ctermid]; char
*ptr;</p>

<p>ptr = ctermid(term);</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The difference between ctermid() and
ttyname() is that ttyname() must be handed a file descriptor
and return a path of the terminal associated with that file
descriptor, while ctermid() returns a string (such as
&quot;/dev/tty&quot; ) that refers to the current
controlling terminal if used as a pathname.</p>

<p>RATIONALE L_ctermid must be defined appropriately for a
given implementation and must be greater than zero so that
array declarations using it are accepted by the compiler.
The value includes the terminating null byte.</p>

<p>Conforming applications that use threads cannot call
ctermid() with NULL as the parameter if either
_POSIX_THREAD_SAFE_FUNCTIONS or _POSIX_THREADS is defined.
If s is not NULL, the ctermid() function generates a string
that, when used as a pathname, refers to the current
controlling terminal for the current process. If s is NULL,
the return value of ctermid() is undefined.</p>

<p>There is no additional burden on the programmer-changing
to use a hypo- thetical thread-safe version of ctermid()
along with allocating a buffer is more of a burden than
merely allocating a buffer. Application code should not
assume that the returned string is short, as some
implementations have more than two pathname components
before reaching a logical device name.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
