<p>sane-dll(5) SANE Scanner Access Now Easy sane-dll(5)</p>

<p>NAME sane-dll - SANE dynamic backend loader</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sane-dll library implements a SANE
(Scanner Access Now Easy) back- end that provides access to
an arbitrary number of other SANE backends. These backends
may either be pre-loaded at the time the sane-dll library is
built or, on systems that support dynamic loading of shared
libraries, the backends may be loaded at runtime. In the
latter case, adding support for a new backend simply
involves installing the rele- vant library in
/usr/lib64/sane and adding an entry to the dll.conf
configuration file. In other words, no applications need to
be modi- fied or recompiled to add support for new
devices.</p>

<p>DEVICE NAMES This backend expects device names of the
form:</p>

<p>backend:device</p>

<p>Where backend is the name of the backend and device is
the name of the device in this backend that should be
addressed. If the device name does not contain a colon (:),
then the entire string is treated as the device string for
the default backend. The default backend is the backend
listed last in the configuration file (see below) or the
first pre-loaded backend (if any).</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION The contents of the dll.conf file is a
list of backend names that may be loaded dynamically upon
demand. Empty lines are ignored, also everything after a
hash mark (#). A sample configuration file is shown
below:</p>

<p>net # this is a comment pnm mustek</p>

<p>Note that backends that were pre-loaded when building
this library do not have to be listed in this configuration
file. That is, if a back- end was preloaded, then that
backend will always be present, regardless of whether its
listed in the configuration file or not.</p>

<p>The list of preloaded backends is determined by macro
PRELOADABLE_BACK- ENDS in file backend/Makefile.in of the
SANE source code distribution. After changing the value of
this macro, it is necessary to reconfigure, rebuild, and
reinstall SANE for the change to take effect.</p>

<p>Aliases are defined in the config file dll.aliases. It
can contain entries of the form</p>

<p>alias SomeName SaneDeviceName alias &quot;Some
Name&quot; SaneDeviceName hide SaneDeviceName</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>alias Epson net:somehost:epson:/dev/sgX alias
&quot;Siemens ST400&quot; st400:/dev/sgY hide
net:somehost:pnm:0 hide net:somehost:pnm:1 alias &quot;Read
from file&quot; pnm:0 hide pnm:1</p>

<p>Aliased device names are automatically hidden.</p>

<p>The idea is that users dont have to deal with
complicated device names (especially for networked devices),
and to hide other exported devices which might confuse them.
Note that a hidden device can still be accessed if the
device name is known, it just doesnt appear on the list.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/sane.d/dll.aliases The list of aliased or
hidden backends.</p>

<p>/etc/sane.d/dll.conf The backend configuration file (see
also description of SANE_CONFIG_DIR below).</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-dll.a The static library
implementing this backend.</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-dll.so The shared library
implementing this backend (present on systems that support
dynamic loading).</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT SANE_CONFIG_DIR This environment variable
specifies the list of directories that may contain the
configuration file. Under UNIX, the directories are
separated by a colon (:), under OS/2, they are separated by
a semi-colon (;). If this variable is not set, the config-
uration file is searched in two default directories: first,
the current working directory (&quot;.&quot;) and then in
/etc/sane.d. If the value of the environment variable ends
with the directory sepa- rator character, then the default
directories are searched after the explicitly specified
directories. For example, setting SANE_CONFIG_DIR to
&quot;/tmp/config:&quot; would result in directories
&quot;tmp/config&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and
&quot;/etc/sane.d&quot; being searched (in this order).</p>

<p>SANE_DEBUG_DLL If the library was compiled with debug
support enabled, this environment variable controls the
debug level for this backend. E.g., a value of 128 requests
all debug output to be printed. Smaller levels reduce
verbosity.</p>

<p>Value Description 0 print severe errors only 1 print
normal errors and important messages 2 print normal messages
3 print debugging messages 4 print everything</p>

<p>Example: export SANE_DEBUG_DLL=3</p>
