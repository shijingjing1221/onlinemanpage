<p>NAME pmdagfs2 - Global Filesystem v2 (GFS2) PMDA</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pmdagfs2 is a Performance Metrics Domain
Agent (PMDA) which exports metric values about mounted GFS2
filesystems from the debugfs filesys- tem. This PMDA
requires debugfs along with at least one mounted GFS2
filesystem to be mounted in order to be able to provide
metric data.</p>

<p>This PMDA can be used with GFS2 filesystems which are
both mounted as local filesystems and filesystems which are
mounted as shared storage within a clustered environment.
However there are some metrics which specifically require
GFS2 to be setup in a clustered environment to be able to
provide metric data. This is due to them expecting locking
mes- sages to be passed via the distributed lock manager
(DLM) between nodes of a cluster in order to generate their
output.</p>

<p>These cluster-environment-only metrics can be
distinguished by the inclusion of their corresponding
control metrics so that they can be optionally enabled or
disabled on systems where they are not desired to be
monitored or not supported.</p>

<p>pmstore(3) can be used to assign values to these control
metrics in order to enable (1) or disable (0) them. This
mechanism is also useful on distributions that do not
currently have full support for the GFS2 trace-points or
provide older versions of the GFS2 driver.</p>

<p>INSTALLATION Install the GFS2 PMDA by using the Install
script as root:</p>

<p># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/gfs2 # ./Install</p>

<p>To uninstall, do the following as root:</p>

<p># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/gfs2 # ./Remove</p>

<p>pmdagfs2 is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be
executed directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify
pmcd when the agent is installed or removed.</p>

<p>FILES $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/gfs2/help default help text file
for the GFS2 metrics</p>

<p>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/gfs2/Install installation script for the
pmdagfs2 agent</p>

<p>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/gfs2/Remove undo installation script for
the pmdagfs2 agent</p>

<p>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/gfs2.log default log file for error
messages from pmdagfs2</p>

<p>PCP ENVIRONMENT Environment variables with the prefix
PCP_ are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP. On each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in pcp.conf(5).</p>
