<p>NAME rhsmcertd - Periodically scans and updates the
entitlement certificates on a registered system.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rhsmcertd [--cert-check-interval=MINUTES]
[--auto-attach-interval=MIN- UTES] [--now] [--debug]
[--help]</p>

<p>Deprecated usage</p>

<p>rhsmcertd [certInterval autoattachInterval]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Red Hat provides content updates and support
by issuing subscriptions for its products. These
subscriptions are applied to systems (machines). Red Hat
Subscription Manager is a tool which allows admin- istrators
to manage those subscriptions by registering systems and
peo- ple, applying subscriptions, and viewing
subscriptions.</p>

<p>When subscriptions are applied to a system or when new
subscriptions are available, the subscription management
system issues that machine an X.509 certificate which
contains all of the details of that sub- scription. The
rhsmcertd process runs periodically to check for changes in
the subscriptions available to a machine by updating the
entitlement certificates installed on the machine and by
installing new entitlement certificates as theyre
available.</p>

<p>At a defined interval, the process checks with the
subscription manage- ment service to see if any new
subscriptions are available to the sys- tem. If there are,
it pulls in the associated subscription certifi- cates. If
any subscriptions have expired and new subscriptions are
available, then the rhsmcertd process will automatically
request those subscriptions.</p>

<p>This rhsmcertd process invokes the certmgr.py script to
perform the certificate add and update operations.</p>

<p>Both the certificate interval and the auto-attach
interval are config- urable and can be reset through the
rhsmcertd daemon itself or by edit- ing the Subscription
Manager /etc/rhsm/rhsm.conf file.</p>

<p>rhsmcertd is started with the machine, by default, and
is always run- ning in the background.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -h, --help Prints the specific help information
for the given command.</p>

<p>-d, --debug Records more verbose output to the
/var/log/rhsm/rhsmcertd.log log file.</p>

<p>-n, --now Runs the rhsmcertd scan immediately, rather
than waiting for the next scheduled interval.</p>

<p>-c, --cert-check-interval=MINUTES Resets the interval
for checking for new subscription certifi- cates. This value
is in minutes. The default is 240, or four hours. This
interval is in effect until the daemon restarts, and then
the values in the /etc/rhsm/rhsm.conf file are used (unless
the argument is passed again).</p>

<p>-i, --auto-attach-interval=MINUTES Resets the interval
for checking for and replacing expired sub- scriptions. This
value is in minutes. The default is 1440, or 24 hours. This
interval is in effect until the daemon restarts, and then
the values in the /etc/rhsm/rhsm.conf file are used (unless
the argument is passed again).</p>

<p>USAGE EXAMPLES NOTE Be sure to stop the running
rhsmcertd daemon before making any configuration changes, or
the new configuration is not applied.</p>

<p>RESETTING THE CERTIFICATE SCAN INTERVAL service
rhsmcertd stop rhsmcertd --cert-check-interval=240</p>

<p>RUNNING CERTIFICATE AND HEALING SCANS IMMEDIATELY
Normally, the certificate and auto-attach scans are run
periodically, on a schedule defined in the rhsmcertd
configuration. The scans can be run immediately -- which is
useful if an administrator knows that there are new
subscriptions available -- and then the scans resume their
schedules. service rhsmcertd stop rhsmcertd -n</p>

<p>DEPRECATED USAGE rhsmcertd used to allow the certificate
and auto-attach intervals to be reset simply by passing two
integers as arguments.</p>

<p>rhsmcertd certInterval autoattachInterval</p>

<p>For example: service rhsmcertd stop rhsmcertd 180
480</p>

<p>This usage is still allowed, but it is deprecated and
not recommended.</p>
