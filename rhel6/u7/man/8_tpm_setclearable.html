<p>TPM Management - tpm_setclearable</p>

<p>NAME tpm_setclearable - disable TPM clear operations</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS tpm_setclearable [OPTION]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION tpm_setclearable reports the status of the
TPM s flags regarding how the TPM can be cleared. This is
the default behavior and also accessible via the --status
option. Requesting a report of this status prompts for the
owner password. The --owner option requests that the TPM
disable clear operations (via the TPM_DisableOwnerClear API)
disabling the owner from clearing out the ownership
information. This operation prompts for the owner password.
This operation is in effect until the current owner is
cleared. The --force option (via the TPM_DisableForceClear
API) disables using Phyiscal Presence to authorize a clear
operation. This operation does not require authorization and
will skip the owner password prompt. This operation is only
in effect until a reboot.</p>

<p>-h, --help Display command usage info.</p>

<p>-v, --version Display command version info.</p>

<p>-l, --log [none|error|info|debug] Set logging level.</p>

<p>-u, --unicode Use TSS UNICODE encoding for passwords to
comply with applications using TSS popup boxes</p>

<p>-s, --status Report the status of flags regarding how
the TPM can be cleared.</p>

<p>-o, --owner Disable use of owner authorization for
authorizating a clear operation until a new owner
exists.</p>

<p>-f, --force Disable use of Physical Presence for
authorizating a clear operation until a reboot has
occurred.</p>

<p>-z, --well-known Authenticate using 20 bytes of zeros as
owner password (the default TSS Well Known Secret), instead
of prompting for an owner password.</p>
