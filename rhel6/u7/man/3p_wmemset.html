<p>WMEMSET(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual WMEMSET(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME wmemset - set wide characters in memory</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;wchar.h&gt;</p>

<p>wchar_t *wmemset(wchar_t *ws, wchar_t wc, size_t n);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The wmemset() function shall copy the value
of wc into each of the first n wide characters of the object
pointed to by ws. This function shall not be affected by
locale and all wchar_t values shall be treated identically.
The null wide character and wchar_t values not corre-
sponding to valid characters shall not be treated
specially.</p>

<p>If n is zero, the application shall ensure that ws is a
valid pointer, and the function shall copy zero wide
characters.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The wmemset() functions shall return the
value of ws.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
