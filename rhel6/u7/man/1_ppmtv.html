<p>NAME ppmtv - make a PPM image look like taken from an
American TV</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ppmtv dimfactor</p>

<p>[ppmfile]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>ppmtv reads a PPM image as input and dims every other
row of image data down by the specified dim factor. This
factor may be in the range of 0.0 (the alternate lines are
totally black) to 1.0 (original image).</p>

<p>This creates an effect similar to what Ive once seen in
the video clip You could be mine by Guns n Roses. In the
scene Im talking about you can see John Connor on his
motorbike, looking up from the water trench (?) hes standing
in. While the camera pulls back, the image gets normal by
brightening up the alternate rows of it. I thought this
would be an interesting effect to try in MPEG. I did not yet
check this out, however. Try for yourself.</p>
