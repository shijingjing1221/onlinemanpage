<p>DOVEADM-SEARCH(1) Dovecot DOVEADM-SEARCH(1)</p>

<p>NAME doveadm-search - Show a list of mailbox GUIDs and
message UIDs matching given search query.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS doveadm [-Dv] [-f formatter] search [-S
socket_path] search_query doveadm [-Dv] [-f formatter]
search [-S socket_path] -A search_query doveadm [-Dv] [-f
formatter] search [-S socket_path] -u user search_query</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The search command is used to find matching
messages. doveadm(1) will print the mailbox&rsquo;s guid and
the message&rsquo;s uid for each match. When used with the
-A or -u wildcard options, doveadm(1) will print the fields
username, mailbox-guid and uid for each matching
message.</p>

<p>In the first form, doveadm(1) will executed the search
action with the environment of the logged in system
user.</p>

<p>In the second form, the command will be performed for
all users.</p>

<p>In the third form, only matching mails of the given
user(s) will be searched.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Global doveadm(1) options:</p>

<p>-D Enables verbosity and debug messages.</p>

<p>-f formatter Specifies the formatter for formatting the
output. Supported formatters are:</p>

<p>flow prints each line with key=value pairs.</p>

<p>pager prints each key: value pair on its own line and
separates records with form feed character (^L).</p>

<p>tab prints a table header followed by tab separated
value lines.</p>

<p>table prints a table header followed by adjusted value
lines.</p>

<p>-v Enables verbosity, including progress counter.</p>

<p>This command uses by default the output formatter flow
(without the key= prefix).</p>

<p>Command specific options:</p>

<p>-A If the -A option is present, the command will be
performed for all users. Using this option in combination
with system users from userdb { driver = passwd } is not
recommended, because it contains also users with a lower UID
than the one configured with the first_valid_uid
setting.</p>

<p>When the SQL userdb module is used make sure that the
iter- ate_query setting in /etc/dovecot/dovecot-sql.conf.ext
matches your database layout. When using the LDAP userdb
module, make sure that the iterate_attrs and iterate_filter
settings in /etc/dovecot/dovecot-ldap.conf.ext match your
LDAP schema. Oth- erwise doveadm(1) will be unable to
iterate over all users.</p>

<p>-S socket_path The option&rsquo;s argument is either an
absolute path to a local UNIX domain socket, or a hostname
and port (hostname:port), in order to connect a remote host
via a TCP socket.</p>

<p>This allows an administrator to execute doveadm(1) mail
commands through the given socket.</p>

<p>-u user/mask Run the command only for the given user.
It&rsquo;s also possible to use &rsquo;*&rsquo; and
&rsquo;?&rsquo; wildcards (e.g. -u *@example.org). When
neither the -A option nor -u user was specified, the com-
mand will be executed with the environment of the currently
logged in user.</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS search_query Show messages matching this
search query. See doveadm-search-query(7) for details.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE This example demonstrates how to search in user
bob&rsquo;s dovecot mailboxes all messages, which contains
the word &quot;todo&quot; in the Subject: header.</p>

<p>doveadm search -u bob mailbox doveco* subject todo
3a94c928d66ebe4bda04000015811c6a 8
3a94c928d66ebe4bda04000015811c6a 25
3a94c928d66ebe4bda04000015811c6a 45</p>

<p>The search command is mainly useful when used together
with doveadm fetch command. For example to save message
bodies of all mes- sages from INBOX that have
&quot;todo&quot; in subject, use:</p>

<p>doveadm search -u bob mailbox INBOX subject todo | while
read guid uid; do doveadm fetch -u bob body mailbox-guid
$guid uid $uid &gt; msg.$uid done</p>
