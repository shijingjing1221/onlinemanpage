<p>HG(1) Mercurial Manual HG(1)</p>

<p>NAME hg - Mercurial source code management system</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS hg command [option]... [argument]...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The hg command provides a command line
interface to the Mercurial sys- tem.</p>

<p>COMMAND ELEMENTS files... indicates one or more filename
or relative path filenames; see File Name Patterns for
information on pattern matching</p>

<p>path indicates a path on the local machine</p>

<p>revision indicates a changeset which can be specified as
a changeset revision number, a tag, or a unique substring of
the changeset hash value</p>

<p>repository path either the pathname of a local
repository or the URI of a remote repository.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -R, --repository repository root directory or
name of overlay bundle file</p>

<p>--cwd change working directory</p>

<p>-y, --noninteractive do not prompt, assume
&rsquo;yes&rsquo; for any required answers</p>

<p>-q, --quiet suppress output</p>

<p>-v, --verbose enable additional output</p>

<p>--config set/override config option</p>

<p>--debug enable debugging output</p>

<p>--debugger start debugger</p>

<p>--encoding set the charset encoding (default: UTF-8)</p>

<p>--encodingmode set the charset encoding mode (default:
strict)</p>

<p>--traceback always print a traceback on exception</p>

<p>--time time how long the command takes</p>

<p>--profile print command execution profile</p>

<p>--version output version information and exit</p>

<p>-h, --help display help and exit</p>

<p>COMMANDS add [OPTION]... [FILE]...</p>

<p>Schedule files to be version controlled and added to the
reposi- tory.</p>

<p>The files will be added to the repository at the next
commit. To undo an add before that, see hg forget.</p>

<p>If no names are given, add all files to the
repository.</p>

<p>options:</p>

<p>-I, --include include names matching the given
patterns</p>

<p>-X, --exclude exclude names matching the given
patterns</p>

<p>-n, --dry-run do not perform actions, just print
output</p>

<p>addremove [OPTION]... [FILE]...</p>

<p>Add all new files and remove all missing files from the
reposi- tory.</p>

<p>New files are ignored if they match any of the patterns
in com- mit.</p>

<p>Use the -s/--similarity option to detect renamed files.
With a parameter greater than 0, this compares every removed
file with every added file and records those similar enough
as renames. This option takes a percentage between 0
(disabled) and 100 (files must be identical) as its
parameter. Detecting renamed files this way can be
expensive.</p>

<p>options:</p>

<p>-s, --similarity guess renamed files by similarity
(0&lt;=s&lt;=100)</p>

<p>-I, --include include names matching the given
patterns</p>

<p>-X, --exclude exclude names matching the given
patterns</p>

<p>-n, --dry-run do not perform actions, just print
output</p>

<p>annotate [-r REV] [-f] [-a] [-u] [-d] [-n] [-c] [-l]
FILE...</p>

<p>List changes in files, showing the revision id
responsible for each line</p>

<p>This command is useful for discovering when a change was
made and by whom.</p>

<p>Without the -a/--text option, annotate will avoid
processing files it detects as binary. With -a, annotate
will annotate the file anyway, although the results will
probably be neither useful nor desirable.</p>

<p>options:</p>

<p>-r, --rev annotate the specified revision</p>

<p>-f, --follow follow file copies and renames</p>

<p>-a, --text treat all files as text</p>

<p>-u, --user list the author (long with -v)</p>

<p>-d, --date list the date (short with -q)</p>

<p>-n, --number list the revision number (default)</p>

<p>-c, --changeset list the changeset</p>

<p>-l, --line-number show line number at the first
appearance</p>

<p>-I, --include include names matching the given
patterns</p>

<p>-X, --exclude exclude names matching the given
patterns</p>

<p>aliases: blame</p>

<p>archive [OPTION]... DEST</p>

<p>By default, the revision used is the parent of the
working directory; use -r/--rev to specify a different
revision.</p>

<p>To specify the type of archive to create, use -t/--type.
Valid types are:</p>

<p>&quot;files&quot; (default): a directory full of files
&quot;tar&quot;: tar archive, uncompressed &quot;tbz2&quot;:
tar archive, compressed using bzip2 &quot;tgz&quot;: tar
archive, compressed using gzip &quot;uzip&quot;: zip
archive, uncompressed &quot;zip&quot;: zip archive,
compressed using deflate</p>

<p>The exact name of the destination archive or directory
is given using a format string; see &rsquo;hg help
export&rsquo; for details.</p>

<p>Each member added to an archive file has a directory
prefix prepended. Use -p/--prefix to specify a format string
for the prefix. The default is the basename of the archive,
with suf- fixes removed.</p>

<p>options:</p>

<p>--no-decode do not pass files through decoders</p>

<p>-p, --prefix directory prefix for files in archive</p>

<p>-r, --rev revision to distribute</p>

<p>-t, --type type of distribution to create</p>

<p>-I, --include include names matching the given
patterns</p>

<p>-X, --exclude exclude names matching the given
patterns</p>

<p>backout [OPTION]... [-r] REV</p>

<p>Commit the backed out changes as a new changeset. The
new changeset is a child of the backed out changeset.</p>

<p>If you backout a changeset other than the tip, a new
head is created. This head will be the new tip and you
should merge this backout changeset with another head.</p>

<p>The --merge option remembers the parent of the working
directory before starting the backout, then merges the new
head with that changeset afterwards. This saves you from
doing the merge by hand. The result of this merge is not
committed, as with a nor- mal merge.</p>

<p>See &rsquo;hg help dates&rsquo; for a list of formats
valid for -d/--date.</p>

<p>options:</p>

<p>--merge merge with old dirstate parent after backout</p>

<p>--parent parent to choose when backing out merge</p>

<p>-r, --rev revision to backout</p>

<p>-I, --include include names matching the given
patterns</p>

<p>-X, --exclude exclude names matching the given
patterns</p>

<p>-m, --message use &lt;text&gt; as commit message</p>

<p>-l, --logfile read commit message from &lt;file&gt;</p>

<p>-d, --date record datecode as commit date</p>

<p>-u, --user record the specified user as committer</p>

<p>bisect [-gbsr] [-c CMD] [REV]</p>

<p>This command helps to find changesets which introduce
problems. To use, mark the earliest changeset you know
exhibits the prob- lem as bad, then mark the latest
changeset which is free from the problem as good. Bisect
will update your working directory to a revision for testing
(unless the -U/--noupdate option is specified). Once you
have performed tests, mark the working directory as good or
bad, and bisect will either update to another candidate
changeset or announce that it has found the bad
revision.</p>

<p>As a shortcut, you can also use the revision argument to
mark a revision as good or bad without checking it out
first.</p>

<p>If you supply a command, it will be used for automatic
bisec- tion. Its exit status will be used to mark revisions
as good or bad: status 0 means good, 125 means to skip the
revision, 127 (command not found) will abort the bisection,
and any other non-zero exit status means the revision is
bad.</p>

<p>options:</p>

<p>-r, --reset reset bisect state</p>

<p>-g, --good mark changeset good</p>

<p>-b, --bad mark changeset bad</p>

<p>-s, --skip skip testing changeset</p>

<p>-c, --command use command to check changeset state</p>

<p>-U, --noupdate do not update to target</p>

<p>branch [-fC] [NAME]</p>

<p>With no argument, show the current branch name. With one
argu- ment, set the working directory branch name (the
branch will not exist in the repository until the next
commit). Standard prac- tice recommends that primary
development take place on the &rsquo;default&rsquo;
branch.</p>

<p>Unless -f/--force is specified, branch will not let you
set a branch name that already exists, even if it&rsquo;s
inactive.</p>

<p>Use -C/--clean to reset the working directory branch to
that of the parent of the working directory, negating a
previous branch change.</p>

<p>Use the command &rsquo;hg update&rsquo; to switch to an
existing branch. Use &rsquo;hg commit --close-branch&rsquo;
to mark this branch as closed.</p>

<p>options:</p>

<p>-f, --force set branch name even if it shadows an
existing branch</p>

<p>-C, --clean reset branch name to parent branch name</p>

<p>branches [-a]</p>

<p>List the repository&rsquo;s named branches, indicating
which ones are inactive. If -c/--closed is specified, also
list branches which have been marked closed (see hg commit
--close-branch).</p>

<p>If -a/--active is specified, only show active branches.
A branch is considered active if it contains repository
heads.</p>

<p>Use the command &rsquo;hg update&rsquo; to switch to an
existing branch.</p>

<p>options:</p>

<p>-a, --active show only branches that have unmerged
heads</p>

<p>-c, --closed show normal and closed branches</p>

<p>bundle [-f] [-a] [-r REV]... [--base REV]... FILE
[DEST]</p>

<p>Generate a compressed changegroup file collecting
changesets not known to be in another repository.</p>

<p>If no destination repository is specified the
destination is assumed to have all the nodes specified by
one or more --base parameters. To create a bundle containing
all changesets, use -a/--all (or --base null).</p>

<p>You can change compression method with the -t/--type
option. The available compression methods are: none, bzip2,
and gzip (by default, bundles are compressed using
bzip2).</p>

<p>The bundle file can then be transferred using
conventional means and applied to another repository with
the unbundle or pull com- mand. This is useful when direct
push and pull are not available or when exporting an entire
repository is undesirable.</p>

<p>Applying bundles preserves all changeset contents
including per- missions, copy/rename information, and
revision history.</p>

<p>options:</p>

<p>-f, --force run even when remote repository is
unrelated</p>

<p>-r, --rev a changeset up to which you would like to
bundle</p>

<p>--base a base changeset to specify instead of a
destination</p>

<p>-a, --all bundle all changesets in the repository</p>

<p>-t, --type bundle compression type to use (default:
bzip2)</p>

<p>-e, --ssh specify ssh command to use</p>

<p>--remotecmd specify hg command to run on the remote
side</p>

<p>cat [OPTION]... FILE...</p>

<p>Print the specified files as they were at the given
revision. If no revision is given, the parent of the working
directory is used, or tip if no revision is checked out.</p>

<p>Output may be to a file, in which case the name of the
file is given using a format string. The formatting rules
are the same as for the export command, with the following
additions:</p>

<p>%s basename of file being printed %d dirname of file
being printed, or &rsquo;.&rsquo; if in repository root %p
root-relative path name of file being printed</p>

<p>options:</p>

<p>-o, --output print output to file with formatted
name</p>

<p>-r, --rev print the given revision</p>

<p>--decode apply any matching decode filter</p>

<p>-I, --include include names matching the given
patterns</p>

<p>-X, --exclude exclude names matching the given
patterns</p>

<p>clone [OPTION]... SOURCE [DEST]</p>

<p>Create a copy of an existing repository in a new
directory.</p>

<p>If no destination directory name is specified, it
defaults to the basename of the source.</p>

<p>The location of the source is added to the new
repository&rsquo;s</p>

<p>See &rsquo;hg help urls&rsquo; for valid source format
details.</p>

<p>It is possible to specify an ssh:// URL as the
destination, but no Please see &rsquo;hg help urls&rsquo;
for important details about ssh:// URLs.</p>

<p>If the -U/--noupdate option is specified, the new clone
will contain only a repository (.hg) and no working copy
(the working copy parent will be the null changeset).
Otherwise, clone will initially check out (in order of
precedence):</p>

<p>a. the changeset, tag or branch specified with
-u/--updaterev</p>

<p>b. the changeset, tag or branch given with the first
-r/--rev</p>

<p>c. the head of the default branch</p>

<p>Use &rsquo;hg clone -u . src dst&rsquo; to checkout the
source repository&rsquo;s parent changeset (applicable for
local source repositories only).</p>

<p>A set of changesets (tags, or branch names) to pull may
be spec- ified by listing each changeset (tag, or branch
name) with -r/--rev. If -r/--rev is used, the cloned
repository will con- tain only a subset of the changesets of
the source repository. Only the set of changesets defined by
all -r/--rev options (including all their ancestors) will be
pulled into the destina- tion repository. No subsequent
changesets (including subsequent tags) will be present in
the destination.</p>

<p>Using -r/--rev (or &rsquo;clone src#rev dest&rsquo;)
implies --pull, even for local source repositories.</p>

<p>For efficiency, hardlinks are used for cloning whenever
the source and destination are on the same filesystem (note
this applies only to the repository data, not to the checked
out files). Some filesystems, such as AFS, implement
hardlinking incorrectly, but do not report errors. In these
cases, use the --pull option to avoid hardlinking.</p>

<p>In some cases, you can clone repositories and checked
out files using full hardlinks with</p>

<p>$ cp -al REPO REPOCLONE</p>

<p>This is the fastest way to clone, but it is not always
safe. The operation is not atomic (making sure REPO is not
modified during the operation is up to you) and you have to
make sure your edi- tor breaks hardlinks (Emacs and most
Linux Kernel tools do so). Also, this is not compatible with
certain extensions that place their metadata under the .hg
directory, such as mq.</p>

<p>options:</p>

<p>-U, --noupdate the clone will only contain a repository
(no working copy)</p>

<p>-u, --updaterev revision, tag or branch to check out</p>

<p>-r, --rev a changeset you would like to have after
cloning</p>

<p>--pull use pull protocol to copy metadata</p>

<p>--uncompressed use uncompressed transfer (fast over
LAN)</p>

<p>-e, --ssh specify ssh command to use</p>

<p>--remotecmd specify hg command to run on the remote
side</p>

<p>commit [OPTION]... [FILE]...</p>

<p>Commit changes to the given files into the repository.
Unlike a centralized RCS, this operation is a local
operation. See hg push for a way to actively distribute your
changes.</p>

<p>If a list of files is omitted, all changes reported by
&quot;hg sta- tus&quot; will be committed.</p>

<p>If you are committing the result of a merge, do not
provide any filenames or -I/-X filters.</p>

<p>If no commit message is specified, the configured editor
is started to prompt you for a message.</p>

<p>See &rsquo;hg help dates&rsquo; for a list of formats
valid for -d/--date.</p>

<p>options:</p>

<p>-A, --addremove mark new/missing files as added/removed
before committing</p>

<p>--close-branch mark a branch as closed, hiding it from
the branch list</p>

<p>-I, --include include names matching the given
patterns</p>

<p>-X, --exclude exclude names matching the given
patterns</p>

<p>-m, --message use &lt;text&gt; as commit message</p>

<p>-l, --logfile read commit message from &lt;file&gt;</p>

<p>-d, --date record datecode as commit date</p>

<p>-u, --user record the specified user as committer</p>

<p>aliases: ci</p>

<p>copy [OPTION]... [SOURCE]... DEST</p>

<p>Mark dest as having copies of source files. If dest is a
direc- tory, copies are put in that directory. If dest is a
file, the source must be a single file.</p>

<p>By default, this command copies the contents of files as
they exist in the working directory. If invoked with
-A/--after, the operation is recorded, but no copying is
performed.</p>

<p>This command takes effect with the next commit. To undo
a copy before that, see hg revert.</p>

<p>options:</p>

<p>-A, --after record a copy that has already occurred</p>

<p>-f, --force forcibly copy over an existing managed
file</p>

<p>-I, --include include names matching the given
patterns</p>

<p>-X, --exclude exclude names matching the given
patterns</p>

<p>-n, --dry-run do not perform actions, just print
output</p>

<p>aliases: cp</p>

<p>diff [OPTION]... [-r REV1 [-r REV2]] [FILE]...</p>

<p>Show differences between revisions for the specified
files.</p>

<p>Differences between files are shown using the unified
diff for- mat.</p>

<p>NOTE: diff may generate unexpected results for merges,
as it will default to comparing against the working
directory&rsquo;s first parent changeset if no revisions are
specified.</p>

<p>When two revision arguments are given, then changes are
shown between those revisions. If only one revision is
specified then that revision is compared to the working
directory, and, when no revisions are specified, the working
directory files are com- pared to its parent.</p>

<p>Without the -a/--text option, diff will avoid generating
diffs of files it detects as binary. With -a, diff will
generate a diff anyway, probably with undesirable
results.</p>

<p>Use the -g/--git option to generate diffs in the git
extended diff format. For more information, read &rsquo;hg
help diffs&rsquo;.</p>

<p>options:</p>

<p>-r, --rev revision</p>

<p>-c, --change change made by revision</p>

<p>-a, --text treat all files as text</p>

<p>-g, --git use git extended diff format</p>

<p>--nodates don&rsquo;t include dates in diff headers</p>

<p>-p, --show-function show which function each change is
in</p>

<p>--reverse produce a diff that undoes the changes</p>

<p>-w, --ignore-all-space ignore white space when comparing
lines</p>

<p>-b, --ignore-space-change ignore changes in the amount
of white space</p>

<p>-B, --ignore-blank-lines ignore changes whose lines are
all blank</p>

<p>-U, --unified number of lines of context to show</p>

<p>--stat output diffstat-style summary of changes</p>

<p>-I, --include include names matching the given
patterns</p>

<p>-X, --exclude exclude names matching the given
patterns</p>

<p>export [OPTION]... [-o OUTFILESPEC] REV...</p>

<p>Print the changeset header and diffs for one or more
revisions.</p>

<p>The information shown in the changeset header is:
author, changeset hash, parent(s) and commit comment.</p>

<p>NOTE: export may generate unexpected diff output for
merge changesets, as it will compare the merge changeset
against its first parent only.</p>

<p>Output may be to a file, in which case the name of the
file is given using a format string. The formatting rules
are as fol- lows:</p>

<p>%% literal &quot;%&quot; character %H changeset hash (40
bytes of hexadecimal) %N number of patches being generated
%R changeset revision number %b basename of the exporting
repository %h short-form changeset hash (12 bytes of
hexadecimal) %n zero-padded sequence number, starting at 1
%r zero-padded changeset revision number</p>

<p>Without the -a/--text option, export will avoid
generating diffs of files it detects as binary. With -a,
export will generate a diff anyway, probably with
undesirable results.</p>

<p>Use the -g/--git option to generate diffs in the git
extended diff format. See &rsquo;hg help diffs&rsquo; for
more information.</p>

<p>With the --switch-parent option, the diff will be
against the second parent. It can be useful to review a
merge.</p>

<p>options:</p>

<p>-o, --output print output to file with formatted
name</p>

<p>--switch-parent diff against the second parent</p>

<p>-a, --text treat all files as text</p>

<p>-g, --git use git extended diff format</p>

<p>--nodates don&rsquo;t include dates in diff headers</p>

<p>forget [OPTION]... FILE...</p>

<p>Mark the specified files so they will no longer be
tracked after the next commit.</p>

<p>This only removes files from the current branch, not
from the entire project history, and it does not delete them
from the working directory.</p>

<p>To undo a forget before the next commit, see hg add.</p>

<p>options:</p>

<p>-I, --include include names matching the given
patterns</p>

<p>-X, --exclude exclude names matching the given
patterns</p>

<p>grep [OPTION]... PATTERN [FILE]...</p>

<p>Search revisions of files for a regular expression.</p>

<p>This command behaves differently than Unix grep. It only
accepts Python/Perl regexps. It searches repository history,
not the working directory. It always prints the revision
number in which a match appears.</p>

<p>By default, grep only prints output for the first
revision of a file in which it finds a match. To get it to
print every revi- sion that contains a change in match
status (&quot;-&quot; for a match that becomes a non-match,
or &quot;+&quot; for a non-match that becomes a match), use
the --all flag.</p>

<p>options:</p>

<p>-0, --print0 end fields with NUL</p>

<p>--all print all revisions that match</p>

<p>-f, --follow follow changeset history, or file history
across copies and renames</p>

<p>-i, --ignore-case ignore case when matching</p>

<p>-l, --files-with-matches print only filenames and
revisions that match</p>

<p>-n, --line-number print matching line numbers</p>

<p>-r, --rev search in given revision range</p>

<p>-u, --user list the author (long with -v)</p>

<p>-d, --date list the date (short with -q)</p>

<p>-I, --include include names matching the given
patterns</p>

<p>-X, --exclude exclude names matching the given
patterns</p>

<p>heads [-r STARTREV] [REV]...</p>

<p>With no arguments, show all repository head
changesets.</p>

<p>Repository &quot;heads&quot; are changesets with no
child changesets. They are where development generally takes
place and are the usual targets for update and merge
operations.</p>

<p>If one or more REV is given, the &quot;branch
heads&quot; will be shown for the named branch associated
with the specified changeset(s).</p>

<p>Branch heads are changesets on a named branch with no
descen- dants on the same branch. A branch head could be a
&quot;true&quot; (repository) head, or it could be the last
changeset on that branch before it was merged into another
branch, or it could be the last changeset on the branch
before a new branch was cre- ated. If none of the branch
heads are true heads, the branch is considered inactive.</p>

<p>If -c/--closed is specified, also show branch heads
marked closed (see hg commit --close-branch).</p>

<p>If STARTREV is specified, only those heads that are
descendants of STARTREV will be displayed.</p>

<p>options:</p>

<p>-r, --rev show only heads which are descendants of
REV</p>

<p>-a, --active show only the active branch heads from open
branches</p>

<p>-c, --closed show normal and closed branch heads</p>

<p>--style display using template map file</p>

<p>--template display with template</p>

<p>help [TOPIC]</p>

<p>With no arguments, print a list of commands with short
help mes- sages.</p>

<p>Given a topic, extension, or command name, print help
for that topic.</p>

<p>identify [-nibt] [-r REV] [SOURCE]</p>

<p>With no revision, print a summary of the current state
of the repository.</p>

<p>Specifying a path to a repository root or Mercurial
bundle will cause lookup to operate on that
repository/bundle.</p>

<p>This summary identifies the repository state using one
or two parent hash identifiers, followed by a &quot;+&quot;
if there are uncom- mitted changes in the working directory,
a list of tags for this revision and a branch name for
non-default branches.</p>

<p>options:</p>

<p>-r, --rev identify the specified revision</p>

<p>-n, --num show local revision number</p>

<p>-i, --id show global revision id</p>

<p>-b, --branch show branch</p>

<p>-t, --tags show tags</p>

<p>aliases: id</p>

<p>import [OPTION]... PATCH...</p>

<p>Import a list of patches and commit them individually
(unless --no-commit is specified).</p>

<p>If there are outstanding changes in the working
directory, import will abort unless given the -f/--force
flag.</p>

<p>You can import a patch straight from a mail message.
Even patches as attachments work (to use the body part, it
must have type text/plain or text/x-patch). From and Subject
headers of email message are used as default committer and
commit message. All text/plain body parts before first diff
are added to commit message.</p>

<p>If the imported patch was generated by hg export, user
and description from patch override values from message
headers and body. Values given on command line with
-m/--message and -u/--user override these.</p>

<p>If --exact is specified, import will set the working
directory to the parent of each patch before applying it,
and will abort if the resulting changeset has a different ID
than the one recorded in the patch. This may happen due to
character set problems or other deficiencies in the text
patch format.</p>

<p>With -s/--similarity, hg will attempt to discover
renames and copies in the patch in the same way as
&rsquo;addremove&rsquo;.</p>

<p>To read a patch from standard input, use &quot;-&quot;
as the patch name. If a URL is specified, the patch will be
downloaded from it. See &rsquo;hg help dates&rsquo; for a
list of formats valid for -d/--date.</p>

<p>options:</p>

<p>-p, --strip directory strip option for patch. This has
the same mean- ing as the corresponding patch option
(default: 1)</p>

<p>-b, --base base path</p>

<p>-f, --force skip check for outstanding uncommitted
changes</p>

<p>--no-commit don&rsquo;t commit, just update the working
directory</p>

<p>--exact apply patch to the nodes from which it was
generated</p>

<p>--import-branch use any branch information in patch
(implied by --exact)</p>

<p>-m, --message use &lt;text&gt; as commit message</p>

<p>-l, --logfile read commit message from &lt;file&gt;</p>

<p>aliases: patch</p>

<p>incoming [-p] [-n] [-M] [-f] [-r REV]... [--bundle
FILENAME] [SOURCE]</p>

<p>Show new changesets found in the specified path/URL or
the default pull location. These are the changesets that
would have been pulled if a pull at the time you issued this
command.</p>

<p>For remote repository, using --bundle avoids downloading
the changesets twice if the incoming is followed by a
pull.</p>

<p>See pull for valid source format details.</p>

<p>options:</p>

<p>-f, --force run even when remote repository is
unrelated</p>

<p>-n, --newest-first show newest record first</p>

<p>--bundle file to store the bundles into</p>

<p>-r, --rev a specific remote revision up to which you
would like to pull</p>

<p>--remotecmd specify hg command to run on the remote
side</p>

<p>aliases: in</p>

<p>init [-e CMD] [--remotecmd CMD] [DEST]</p>

<p>Initialize a new repository in the given directory. If
the given directory does not exist, it will be created.</p>

<p>If no directory is given, the current directory is
used.</p>

<p>It is possible to specify an ssh:// URL as the
destination. See &rsquo;hg help urls&rsquo; for more
information.</p>

<p>options:</p>

<p>-e, --ssh specify ssh command to use</p>

<p>--remotecmd specify hg command to run on the remote
side</p>

<p>locate [OPTION]... [PATTERN]...</p>

<p>Print files under Mercurial control in the working
directory whose names match the given patterns.</p>

<p>By default, this command searches all directories in the
working directory. To search just the current directory and
its subdi- rectories, use &quot;--include .&quot;.</p>

<p>If no patterns are given to match, this command prints
the names of all files under Mercurial control in the
working directory.</p>

<p>If you want to feed the output of this command into the
&quot;xargs&quot; command, use the -0 option to both this
command and &quot;xargs&quot;. This will avoid the problem
of &quot;xargs&quot; treating single filenames that contain
whitespace as multiple filenames.</p>

<p>options:</p>

<p>-r, --rev search the repository as it stood at REV</p>

<p>-0, --print0 end filenames with NUL, for use with
xargs</p>

<p>-f, --fullpath print complete paths from the filesystem
root</p>

<p>-I, --include include names matching the given
patterns</p>

<p>-X, --exclude exclude names matching the given
patterns</p>

<p>log [OPTION]... [FILE]</p>

<p>Print the revision history of the specified files or the
entire project.</p>

<p>File history is shown without following rename or copy
history of files. Use -f/--follow with a filename to follow
history across renames and copies. --follow without a
filename will only show ancestors or descendants of the
starting revision. --fol- low-first only follows the first
parent of merge revisions.</p>

<p>If no revision range is specified, the default is tip:0
unless --follow is set, in which case the working directory
parent is used as the starting revision.</p>

<p>See &rsquo;hg help dates&rsquo; for a list of formats
valid for -d/--date.</p>

<p>By default this command prints revision number and
changeset id, tags, non-trivial parents, user, date and
time, and a summary for each commit. When the -v/--verbose
switch is used, the list of changed files and full commit
message are shown.</p>

<p>NOTE: log -p/--patch may generate unexpected diff output
for merge changesets, as it will only compare the merge
changeset against its first parent. Also, only files
different from BOTH parents will appear in files:.</p>

<p>options:</p>

<p>-f, --follow follow changeset history, or file history
across copies and renames</p>

<p>--follow-first only follow the first parent of merge
changesets</p>

<p>-d, --date show revisions matching date spec</p>

<p>aliases: history</p>

<p>manifest [-r REV]</p>

<p>Print a list of version controlled files for the given
revision. If no revision is given, the first parent of the
working direc- tory is used, or the null revision if no
revision is checked out.</p>

<p>With -v, print file permissions, symlink and executable
bits. With --debug, print file revision hashes.</p>

<p>options:</p>

<p>-r, --rev revision to display</p>

<p>merge [-f] [[-r] REV]</p>

<p>The current working directory is updated with all
changes made in the requested revision since the last common
predecessor revision.</p>

<p>Files that changed between either parent are marked as
changed for the next commit and a commit must be performed
before any further updates to the repository are allowed.
The next commit will have two parents.</p>

<p>If no revision is specified, the working
directory&rsquo;s parent is a head revision, and the current
branch contains exactly one other head, the other head is
merged with by default. Otherwise, an explicit revision with
which to merge with must be provided.</p>

<p>options:</p>

<p>-f, --force force a merge with outstanding changes</p>

<p>-r, --rev revision to merge</p>

<p>-P, --preview review revisions to merge (no merge is
performed)</p>

<p>outgoing [-M] [-p] [-n] [-f] [-r REV]... [DEST]</p>

<p>Show changesets not found in the specified destination
reposi- tory or the default push location. These are the
changesets that would be pushed if a push was requested.</p>

<p>See pull for valid destination format details.</p>

<p>options:</p>

<p>aliases: out</p>

<p>parents [-r REV] [FILE]</p>

<p>Print the working directory&rsquo;s parent revisions. If
a revision is given via -r/--rev, the parent of that
revision will be printed. If a file argument is given, the
revision in which the file was last changed (before the
working directory revision or the argu- ment to --rev if
given) is printed.</p>

<p>options:</p>

<p>-r, --rev show parents from the specified revision</p>

<p>--style display using template map file</p>

<p>--template display with template</p>

<p>paths [NAME]</p>

<p>Show definition of symbolic path name NAME. If no name
is given, show definition of all available names.</p>

<p>Path names are defined in the [paths] section of
/etc/mercu- rial/hgrc and $HOME/.hgrc. If run inside a
repository, .hg/hgrc is used, too.</p>

<p>See &rsquo;hg help urls&rsquo; for more information.</p>

<p>pull [-u] [-f] [-r REV]... [-e CMD] [--remotecmd CMD]
[SOURCE]</p>

<p>Pull changes from a remote repository to a local
one.</p>

<p>This finds all changes from the repository at the
specified path or URL and adds them to a local repository
(the current one unless -R is specified). By default, this
does not update the copy of the project in the working
directory.</p>

<p>Use hg incoming if you want to see what would have been
added by a pull at the time you issued this command. If you
then decide to added those changes to the repository, you
should use pull -r X where X is the last changeset listed by
hg incoming.</p>

<p>If SOURCE is omitted, the &rsquo;default&rsquo; path
will be used. See &rsquo;hg help urls&rsquo; for more
information.</p>

<p>options:</p>

<p>-u, --update update to new tip if changesets were
pulled</p>

<p>-f, --force run even when remote repository is
unrelated</p>

<p>-r, --rev a specific remote revision up to which you
would like to pull</p>

<p>-e, --ssh specify ssh command to use</p>

<p>--remotecmd specify hg command to run on the remote
side</p>

<p>push [-f] [-r REV]... [-e CMD] [--remotecmd CMD]
[DEST]</p>

<p>Push changes from the local repository to the given
destination.</p>

<p>This is the symmetrical operation for pull. It moves
changes from the current repository to a different one. If
the destina- tion is local this is identical to a pull in
that directory from the current one.</p>

<p>By default, push will refuse to run if it detects the
result would increase the number of remote heads. This
generally indi- cates the user forgot to pull and merge
before pushing.</p>

<p>If -r/--rev is used, the named revision and all its
ancestors will be pushed to the remote repository.</p>

<p>Please see &rsquo;hg help urls&rsquo; for important
details about ssh:// URLs. If DESTINATION is omitted, a
default path will be used.</p>

<p>options:</p>

<p>-f, --force force push</p>

<p>-r, --rev a specific revision up to which you would like
to push</p>

<p>-e, --ssh specify ssh command to use</p>

<p>--remotecmd specify hg command to run on the remote
side</p>

<p>recover</p>

<p>Recover from an interrupted commit or pull.</p>

<p>This command tries to fix the repository status after an
inter- rupted operation. It should only be necessary when
Mercurial suggests it.</p>

<p>remove [OPTION]... FILE...</p>

<p>Schedule the indicated files for removal from the
repository.</p>

<p>This only removes files from the current branch, not
from the entire project history. -A/--after can be used to
remove only files that have already been deleted, -f/--force
can be used to force deletion, and -Af can be used to remove
files from the next revision without deleting them from the
working directory.</p>

<p>The following table details the behavior of remove for
different file states (columns) and option combinations
(rows). The file states are Added [A], Clean [C], Modified
[M] and Missing [!] (as reported by hg status). The actions
are Warn, Remove (from branch) and Delete (from disk):</p>

<p>A C M ! none W RD W R -f R RD RD R -A W W W R -Af R R R
R</p>

<p>This command schedules the files to be removed at the
next com- mit. To undo a remove before that, see hg
revert.</p>

<p>options:</p>

<p>-A, --after record delete for missing files</p>

<p>-f, --force remove (and delete) file even if added or
modified</p>

<p>-I, --include include names matching the given
patterns</p>

<p>-X, --exclude exclude names matching the given
patterns</p>

<p>aliases: rm</p>

<p>rename [OPTION]... SOURCE... DEST</p>

<p>Mark dest as copies of sources; mark sources for
deletion. If dest is a directory, copies are put in that
directory. If dest is a file, there can only be one
source.</p>

<p>By default, this command copies the contents of files as
they exist in the working directory. If invoked with
-A/--after, the operation is recorded, but no copying is
performed.</p>

<p>This command takes effect at the next commit. To undo a
rename before that, see hg revert.</p>

<p>options:</p>

<p>-A, --after record a rename that has already
occurred</p>

<p>-f, --force forcibly copy over an existing managed
file</p>

<p>-I, --include include names matching the given
patterns</p>

<p>-X, --exclude exclude names matching the given
patterns</p>

<p>-n, --dry-run do not perform actions, just print
output</p>

<p>aliases: mv</p>

<p>resolve [OPTION]... [FILE]...</p>

<p>This command can cleanly retry unresolved file merges
using file revisions preserved from the last update or
merge.</p>

<p>If a conflict is resolved manually, please note that the
changes will be overwritten if the merge is retried with
resolve. The -m/--mark switch should be used to mark the
file as resolved.</p>

<p>You can specify a set of files to operate on, or use the
-a/-all switch to select all unresolved files.</p>

<p>This command also allows listing resolved files and
manually indicating whether or not files are resolved. All
files must be marked as resolved before a commit is
permitted.</p>

<p>The codes used to show the status of files are:</p>

<p>U = unresolved R = resolved</p>

<p>options:</p>

<p>-a, --all select all unresolved files</p>

<p>-l, --list list state of files needing merge</p>

<p>-m, --mark mark files as resolved</p>

<p>-u, --unmark unmark files as resolved</p>

<p>-n, --no-status hide status prefix</p>

<p>-I, --include include names matching the given
patterns</p>

<p>-X, --exclude exclude names matching the given
patterns</p>

<p>revert [OPTION]... [-r REV] [NAME]...</p>

<p>(Use update -r to check out earlier revisions, revert
does not change the working directory parents.)</p>

<p>With no revision specified, revert the named files or
directo- ries to the contents they had in the parent of the
working directory. This restores the contents of the
affected files to an unmodified state and unschedules adds,
removes, copies, and renames. If the working directory has
two parents, you must explicitly specify the revision to
revert to.</p>

<p>Using the -r/--rev option, revert the given files or
directories to their contents as of a specific revision.
This can be helpful to &quot;roll back&quot; some or all of
an earlier change. See &rsquo;hg help dates&rsquo; for a
list of formats valid for -d/--date.</p>

<p>Revert modifies the working directory. It does not
commit any changes, or change the parent of the working
directory. If you revert to a revision other than the parent
of the working direc- tory, the reverted files will thus
appear modified afterwards.</p>

<p>If a file has been deleted, it is restored. If the
executable mode of a file was changed, it is reset.</p>

<p>If names are given, all files matching the names are
reverted. If no arguments are given, no files are
reverted.</p>

<p>Modified files are saved with a .orig suffix before
reverting. To disable these backups, use --no-backup.</p>

<p>options:</p>

<p>-a, --all revert all changes when no arguments given</p>

<p>-d, --date tipmost revision matching date</p>

<p>-r, --rev revision to revert to</p>

<p>--no-backup do not save backup copies of files</p>

<p>-I, --include include names matching the given
patterns</p>

<p>-X, --exclude exclude names matching the given
patterns</p>

<p>-n, --dry-run do not perform actions, just print
output</p>

<p>rollback</p>

<p>This command should be used with care. There is only one
level of rollback, and there is no way to undo a rollback.
It will also restore the dirstate at the time of the last
transaction, losing any dirstate changes since that time.
This command does not alter the working directory.</p>

<p>Transactions are used to encapsulate the effects of all
commands that create new changesets or propagate existing
changesets into a repository. For example, the following
commands are transac- tional, and their effects can be
rolled back:</p>

<p>commit import pull push (with this repository as
destination) unbundle</p>

<p>This command is not intended for use on public
repositories. Once changes are visible for pull by other
users, rolling a transaction back locally is ineffective
(someone else may already have pulled the changes).
Furthermore, a race is possi- ble with readers of the
repository; for example an in-progress pull from the
repository may fail if a rollback is performed.</p>

<p>root</p>

<p>Print the root directory of the current repository.</p>

<p>serve [OPTION]...</p>

<p>Start a local HTTP repository browser and pull
server.</p>

<p>By default, the server logs accesses to stdout and
errors to stderr. Use the -A/--accesslog and -E/--errorlog
options to log to files.</p>

<p>options:</p>

<p>-A, --accesslog name of access log file to write to</p>

<p>-d, --daemon run server in background</p>

<p>--daemon-pipefds used internally by daemon mode</p>

<p>-E, --errorlog name of error log file to write to</p>

<p>-p, --port port to listen on (default: 8000)</p>

<p>-a, --address address to listen on (default: all
interfaces)</p>

<p>--prefix prefix path to serve from (default: server
root)</p>

<p>-n, --name name to show in web pages (default: working
directory)</p>

<p>--webdir-conf name of the webdir config file (serve more
than one repository)</p>

<p>--pid-file name of file to write process ID to</p>

<p>--stdio for remote clients</p>

<p>-t, --templates web templates to use</p>

<p>--style template style to use</p>

<p>-6, --ipv6 use IPv6 in addition to IPv4</p>

<p>--certificate SSL certificate file</p>

<p>showconfig [-u] [NAME]...</p>

<p>With no arguments, print names and values of all config
items.</p>

<p>With one argument of the form section.name, print just
the value of that config item.</p>

<p>With multiple arguments, print names and values of all
config items with matching section names.</p>

<p>With --debug, the source (filename and line number) is
printed for each config item.</p>

<p>options:</p>

<p>-u, --untrusted show untrusted configuration options</p>

<p>aliases: debugconfig</p>

<p>status [OPTION]... [FILE]...</p>

<p>Show status of files in the repository. If names are
given, only files that match are shown. Files that are clean
or ignored or the source of a copy/move operation, are not
listed unless -c/--clean, -i/--ignored, -C/--copies or
-A/--all are given. Unless options described with &quot;show
only ...&quot; are given, the options -mardu are used.</p>

<p>Option -q/--quiet hides untracked (unknown and ignored)
files unless explicitly requested with -u/--unknown or
-i/--ignored.</p>

<p>NOTE: status may appear to disagree with diff if
permissions have changed or a merge has occurred. The
standard diff format does not report permission changes and
diff only reports changes relative to one merge parent.</p>

<p>If one revision is given, it is used as the base
revision. If two revisions are given, the differences
between them are shown.</p>

<p>The codes used to show the status of files are:</p>

<p>M = modified A = added R = removed C = clean ! = missing
(deleted by non-hg command, but still tracked) ? = not
tracked I = ignored = origin of the previous file listed as
A (added)</p>

<p>options:</p>

<p>-A, --all show status of all files</p>

<p>-m, --modified show only modified files</p>

<p>-a, --added show only added files</p>

<p>-r, --removed show only removed files</p>

<p>-d, --deleted show only deleted (but tracked) files</p>

<p>-c, --clean show only files without changes</p>

<p>-u, --unknown show only unknown (not tracked) files</p>

<p>-i, --ignored show only ignored files</p>

<p>-n, --no-status hide status prefix</p>

<p>-C, --copies show source of copied files</p>

<p>-0, --print0 end filenames with NUL, for use with
xargs</p>

<p>--rev show difference from revision</p>

<p>-I, --include include names matching the given
patterns</p>

<p>-X, --exclude exclude names matching the given
patterns</p>

<p>aliases: st</p>

<p>summary [--remote]</p>

<p>This generates a brief summary of the working directory
state, including parents, branch, commit status, and
available updates.</p>

<p>With the --remote option, this will check the default
paths for incoming and outgoing changes. This can be
time-consuming.</p>

<p>options:</p>

<p>--remote check for push and pull</p>

<p>aliases: sum</p>

<p>tag [-l] [-m TEXT] [-d DATE] [-u USER] [-r REV]
NAME...</p>

<p>Name a particular revision using &lt;name&gt;.</p>

<p>Tags are used to name particular revisions of the
repository and are very useful to compare different
revisions, to go back to significant earlier versions or to
mark branch points as releases, etc.</p>

<p>If no revision is given, the parent of the working
directory is used, or tip if no revision is checked out.</p>

<p>To facilitate version control, distribution, and merging
of tags, they are stored as a file named &quot;.hgtags&quot;
which is managed similarly to other project files and can be
hand-edited if nec- essary. The file
&rsquo;.hg/localtags&rsquo; is used for local tags (not
shared among repositories).</p>

<p>See &rsquo;hg help dates&rsquo; for a list of formats
valid for -d/--date.</p>

<p>options:</p>

<p>-f, --force replace existing tag</p>

<p>-l, --local make the tag local</p>

<p>-r, --rev revision to tag</p>

<p>--remove remove a tag</p>

<p>-m, --message use &lt;text&gt; as commit message</p>

<p>-d, --date record datecode as commit date</p>

<p>-u, --user record the specified user as committer</p>

<p>tags</p>

<p>This lists both regular and local tags. When the
-v/--verbose switch is used, a third column
&quot;local&quot; is printed for local tags.</p>

<p>tip [-p]</p>

<p>The tip revision (usually just called the tip) is the
changeset most recently added to the repository (and
therefore the most recently changed head).</p>

<p>If you have just made a commit, that commit will be the
tip. If you have just pulled changes from another
repository, the tip of that repository becomes the current
tip. The &quot;tip&quot; tag is spe- cial and cannot be
renamed or assigned to a different changeset.</p>

<p>options:</p>

<p>-p, --patch show patch</p>

<p>-g, --git use git extended diff format</p>

<p>--style display using template map file</p>

<p>--template display with template</p>

<p>unbundle [-u] FILE...</p>

<p>Apply one or more compressed changegroup files generated
by the bundle command.</p>

<p>options:</p>

<p>-u, --update update to new tip if changesets were
unbundled</p>

<p>update [-c] [-C] [-d DATE] [[-r] REV]</p>

<p>Update the repository&rsquo;s working directory to the
specified changeset.</p>

<p>If no changeset is specified, attempt to update to the
head of the current branch. If this head is a descendant of
the working directory&rsquo;s parent, update to it,
otherwise abort.</p>

<p>The following rules apply when the working directory
contains uncommitted changes:</p>

<p>1. If neither -c/--check nor -C/--clean is specified,
and if the requested changeset is an ancestor or descendant
of the work- ing directory&rsquo;s parent, the uncommitted
changes are merged into the requested changeset and the
merged result is left uncommitted. If the requested
changeset is not an ancestor or descendant (that is, it is
on another branch), the update is aborted and the
uncommitted changes are preserved.</p>

<p>2. With the -c/--check option, the update is aborted and
the uncommitted changes are preserved.</p>

<p>3. With the -C/--clean option, uncommitted changes are
discarded and the working directory is updated to the
requested change- set.</p>

<p>Use null as the changeset to remove the working
directory (like &rsquo;hg clone -U&rsquo;).</p>

<p>If you want to update just one file to an older
changeset, use &rsquo;hg revert&rsquo;.</p>

<p>See &rsquo;hg help dates&rsquo; for a list of formats
valid for -d/--date.</p>

<p>options:</p>

<p>-C, --clean discard uncommitted changes (no backup)</p>

<p>-c, --check check for uncommitted changes</p>

<p>-d, --date tipmost revision matching date</p>

<p>-r, --rev revision</p>

<p>aliases: up checkout co</p>

<p>verify</p>

<p>Verify the integrity of the current repository.</p>

<p>This will perform an extensive check of the
repository&rsquo;s integrity, validating the hashes and
checksums of each entry in the changelog, manifest, and
tracked files, as well as the integrity of their crosslinks
and indices.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION FILES Mercurial reads configuration data
from several files, if they exist. Below we list the most
specific file first.</p>

<p>On Windows, these configuration files are read:</p>

<p>&middot; &lt;repo.hgrc</p>

<p>&middot; %USERPROFILE.hgrc</p>

<p>&middot; %USERPROFILEMercurial.ini</p>

<p>&middot; %HOME.hgrc</p>

<p>&middot; %HOMEMercurial.ini</p>

<p>&middot; CMercuriaMercurial.ini</p>

<p>&middot; HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINOFTWARMercurial</p>

<p>&middot; &lt;install-dirMercurial.ini</p>

<p>On Unix, these files are read:</p>

<p>&middot; &lt;repo&gt;/.hg/hgrc</p>

<p>&middot; $HOME/.hgrc</p>

<p>&middot; /etc/mercurial/hgrc</p>

<p>&middot; /etc/mercurial/hgrc.d/*.rc</p>

<p>&middot; &lt;install-root&gt;/etc/mercurial/hgrc</p>

<p>&middot;
&lt;install-root&gt;/etc/mercurial/hgrc.d/*.rc</p>

<p>The configuration files for Mercurial use a simple
ini-file format. A configuration file consists of sections,
led by a [section] header and followed by name = value
entries:</p>

<p>[ui] username = Firstname Lastname
&lt;firstname.lastname@example.net&gt; verbose = True</p>

<p>This above entries will be referred to as ui.username
and ui.verbose, respectively. Please see the hgrc man page
for a full description of the possible configuration
values:</p>

<p>&middot; on Unix-like systems: man hgrc</p>

<p>DATE FORMATS Some commands allow the user to specify a
date, e.g.:</p>

<p>&middot; backout, commit, import, tag: Specify the
commit date.</p>

<p>&middot; log, revert, update: Select revision(s) by
date.</p>

<p>Many date formats are valid. Here are some examples:</p>

<p>&quot;Wed Dec 6 13:18:29 2006&quot; (local timezone
assumed) &quot;Dec 6 13:18 -0600&quot; (year assumed, time
offset provided) &quot;Dec 6 13:18 UTC&quot; (UTC and GMT
are aliases for +0000) &quot;Dec 6&quot; (midnight)
&quot;13:18&quot; (today assumed) &quot;3:39&quot; (3:39AM
assumed) &quot;3:39pm&quot; (15:39) &quot;2006-12-06
13:18:29&quot; (ISO 8601 format) &quot;2006-12-6 13:18&quot;
&quot;2006-12-6&quot; &quot;12-6&quot; &quot;12/6&quot;
&quot;12/6/6&quot; (Dec 6 2006)</p>

<p>Lastly, there is Mercurial&rsquo;s internal format:</p>

<p>&quot;1165432709 0&quot; (Wed Dec 6 13:18:29 2006
UTC)</p>

<p>This is the internal representation format for dates.
unixtime is the number of seconds since the epoch
(1970-01-01 00:00 UTC). offset is the offset of the local
timezone, in seconds west of UTC (negative if the timezone
is east of UTC).</p>

<p>The log command also accepts date ranges:</p>

<p>&quot;&lt;{datetime}&quot; - at or before a given
date/time &quot;&gt;{datetime}&quot; - on or after a given
date/time &quot;{datetime} to {datetime}&quot; - a date
range, inclusive &quot;-{days}&quot; - within a given number
of days of today</p>

<p>FILE NAME PATTERNS Mercurial accepts several notations
for identifying one or more files at a time.</p>

<p>By default, Mercurial treats filenames as shell-style
extended glob patterns.</p>

<p>Alternate pattern notations must be specified
explicitly.</p>

<p>To use a plain path name without any pattern matching,
start it with path:. These path names must completely match
starting at the current repository root.</p>

<p>To use an extended glob, start a name with glob:. Globs
are rooted at the current directory; a glob such as *.c will
only match files in the current directory ending with
.c.</p>

<p>The supported glob syntax extensions are ** to match any
string across path separators and {a,b} to mean &quot;a or
b&quot;.</p>

<p>To use a Perl/Python regular expression, start a name
with re:. Regexp pattern matching is anchored at the root of
the repository.</p>

<p>Plain examples:</p>

<p>path:foo/bar a name bar in a directory named foo in the
root of the repository path:path:name a file or directory
named &quot;path:name&quot;</p>

<p>Glob examples:</p>

<p>glob:*.c any name ending in &quot;.c&quot; in the
current directory *.c any name ending in &quot;.c&quot; in
the current directory **.c any name ending in &quot;.c&quot;
in any subdirectory of the current directory including
itself. foo/*.c any name ending in &quot;.c&quot; in the
directory foo foo/**.c any name ending in &quot;.c&quot; in
any subdirectory of foo including itself.</p>

<p>Regexp examples:</p>

<p>re:.*.c$ any name ending in &quot;.c&quot;, anywhere in
the repository</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES HG Path to the &rsquo;hg&rsquo;
executable, automatically passed when running hooks,
extensions or external tools. If unset or empty, this is the
hg executable&rsquo;s name if it&rsquo;s frozen, or an
executable named &rsquo;hg&rsquo; (with %PATHEXT%
[defaulting to COM/EXE/BAT/CMD] extensions on Windows) is
searched.</p>

<p>HGEDITOR This is the name of the editor to run when
committing. See EDI- TOR.</p>

<p>(deprecated, use .hgrc)</p>

<p>HGENCODING This overrides the default locale setting
detected by Mercurial. This setting is used to convert data
including usernames, changeset descriptions, tag names, and
branches. This setting can be overridden with the --encoding
command-line option.</p>

<p>HGENCODINGMODE This sets Mercurial&rsquo;s behavior for
handling unknown characters while transcoding user input.
The default is &quot;strict&quot;, which causes Mercurial to
abort if it can&rsquo;t map a character. Other settings
include &quot;replace&quot;, which replaces unknown
characters, and &quot;ignore&quot;, which drops them. This
setting can be overridden with the --encodingmode
command-line option.</p>

<p>HGMERGE An executable to use for resolving merge
conflicts. The program will be executed with three
arguments: local file, remote file, ancestor file.</p>

<p>(deprecated, use .hgrc)</p>

<p>HGRCPATH A list of files or directories to search for
hgrc files. Item separator is &quot;:&quot; on Unix,
&quot;;&quot; on Windows. If HGRCPATH is not set, platform
default search path is used. If empty, only the .hg/hgrc
from the current repository is read.</p>

<p>For each element in HGRCPATH:</p>

<p>&middot; if it&rsquo;s a directory, all files ending
with .rc are added</p>

<p>&middot; otherwise, the file itself will be added</p>

<p>HGUSER This is the string used as the author of a
commit. If not set, available values will be considered in
this order:</p>

<p>&middot; HGUSER (deprecated)</p>

<p>&middot; hgrc files from the HGRCPATH</p>

<p>&middot; EMAIL</p>

<p>&middot; interactive prompt</p>

<p>&middot; LOGNAME (with @hostname appended)</p>

<p>(deprecated, use .hgrc)</p>

<p>EMAIL May be used as the author of a commit; see
HGUSER.</p>

<p>LOGNAME May be used as the author of a commit; see
HGUSER.</p>

<p>VISUAL This is the name of the editor to use when
committing. See EDI- TOR.</p>

<p>EDITOR Sometimes Mercurial needs to open a text file in
an editor for a user to modify, for example when writing
commit messages. The editor it uses is determined by looking
at the environment vari- ables HGEDITOR, VISUAL and EDITOR,
in that order. The first non-empty one is chosen. If all of
them are empty, the editor defaults to &rsquo;vi&rsquo;.</p>

<p>PYTHONPATH This is used by Python to find imported
modules and may need to be set appropriately if this
Mercurial is not installed sys- tem-wide.</p>

<p>SPECIFYING SINGLE REVISIONS Mercurial supports several
ways to specify individual revisions.</p>

<p>A plain integer is treated as a revision number.
Negative integers are treated as sequential offsets from the
tip, with -1 denoting the tip, -2 denoting the revision
prior to the tip, and so forth.</p>

<p>A 40-digit hexadecimal string is treated as a unique
revision identi- fier.</p>

<p>A hexadecimal string less than 40 characters long is
treated as a unique revision identifier and is referred to
as a short-form identifier. A short-form identifier is only
valid if it is the prefix of exactly one full-length
identifier.</p>

<p>Any other string is treated as a tag or branch name. A
tag name is a symbolic name associated with a revision
identifier. A branch name denotes the tipmost revision of
that branch. Tag and branch names must not contain the
&quot;:&quot; character.</p>

<p>The reserved name &quot;tip&quot; is a special tag that
always identifies the most recent revision.</p>

<p>The reserved name &quot;null&quot; indicates the null
revision. This is the revi- sion of an empty repository, and
the parent of revision 0.</p>

<p>The reserved name &quot;.&quot; indicates the working
directory parent. If no working directory is checked out, it
is equivalent to null. If an uncommitted merge is in
progress, &quot;.&quot; is the revision of the first par-
ent.</p>

<p>SPECIFYING MULTIPLE REVISIONS When Mercurial accepts
more than one revision, they may be specified individually,
or provided as a topologically continuous range, sepa- rated
by the &quot;:&quot; character.</p>

<p>The syntax of range notation is [BEGIN]:[END], where
BEGIN and END are revision identifiers. Both BEGIN and END
are optional. If BEGIN is not specified, it defaults to
revision number 0. If END is not specified, it defaults to
the tip. The range &quot;:&quot; thus means &quot;all
revisions&quot;.</p>

<p>If BEGIN is greater than END, revisions are treated in
reverse order.</p>

<p>A range acts as a closed interval. This means that a
range of 3:5 gives 3, 4 and 5. Similarly, a range of 9:6
gives 9, 8, 7, and 6.</p>

<p>DIFF FORMATS Mercurial&rsquo;s default format for
showing changes between two versions of a file is compatible
with the unified format of GNU diff, which can be used by
GNU patch and many other standard tools.</p>

<p>While this standard format is often enough, it does not
encode the fol- lowing information:</p>

<p>&middot; executable status and other permission bits</p>

<p>&middot; copy or rename information</p>

<p>&middot; changes in binary files</p>

<p>&middot; creation or deletion of empty files</p>

<p>Mercurial also supports the extended diff format from
the git VCS which addresses these limitations. The git diff
format is not produced by default because a few widespread
tools still do not understand this format.</p>

<p>This means that when generating diffs from a Mercurial
repository (e.g. with &quot;hg export&quot;), you should be
careful about things like file copies and renames or other
things mentioned above, because when applying a standard
diff to a different repository, this extra information is
lost. Mercurial&rsquo;s internal operations (like push and
pull) are not affected by this, because they use an internal
binary format for commu- nicating changes.</p>

<p>To make Mercurial produce the git extended diff format,
use the --git option available for many commands, or set
&rsquo;git = True&rsquo; in the [diff] section of your hgrc.
You do not need to set this option when importing diffs in
this format or using them in the mq extension.</p>

<p>TEMPLATE USAGE Mercurial allows you to customize output
of commands through templates. You can either pass in a
template from the command line, via the --tem- plate option,
or select an existing template-style (--style).</p>

<p>You can customize output for any &quot;log-like&quot;
command: log, outgoing, incoming, tip, parents, heads and
glog.</p>

<p>Three styles are packaged with Mercurial: default (the
style used when no explicit preference is passed), compact
and changelog. Usage:</p>

<p>$ hg log -r1 --style changelog</p>

<p>A template is a piece of text, with markup to invoke
variable expan- sion:</p>

<p>$ hg log -r1 --template &quot;{node}0
b56ce7b07c52de7d5fd79fb89701ea538af65746</p>

<p>Strings in curly braces are called keywords. The
availability of key- words depends on the exact context of
the templater. These keywords are usually available for
templating a log-like command:</p>

<p>author String. The unmodified author of the
changeset.</p>

<p>branches String. The name of the branch on which the
changeset was com- mitted. Will be empty if the branch name
was default.</p>

<p>date Date information. The date when the changeset was
committed.</p>

<p>desc String. The text of the changeset description.</p>

<p>diffstat String. Statistics of changes with the
following format: &quot;modi- fied files: +added/-removed
lines&quot;</p>

<p>files List of strings. All files modified, added, or
removed by this changeset.</p>

<p>file_adds List of strings. Files added by this
changeset.</p>

<p>file_mods List of strings. Files modified by this
changeset.</p>

<p>file_dels List of strings. Files removed by this
changeset.</p>

<p>node String. The changeset identification hash, as a
40-character hexadecimal string.</p>

<p>parents List of strings. The parents of the
changeset.</p>

<p>rev Integer. The repository-local changeset revision
number.</p>

<p>tags List of strings. Any tags associated with the
changeset.</p>

<p>latesttag String. Most recent global tag in the
ancestors of this change- set.</p>

<p>latesttagdistance Integer. Longest path to the latest
tag.</p>

<p>The &quot;date&quot; keyword does not produce
human-readable output. If you want to use a date in your
output, you can use a filter to process it. Fil- ters are
functions which return a string based on the input variable.
You can also use a chain of filters to get the desired
output:</p>

<p>$ hg tip --template &quot;{date|isodate}0 2008-08-21
18:22 +0000</p>

<p>List of filters:</p>

<p>addbreaks Any text. Add an XHTML &quot;&lt;br
/&gt;&quot; tag before the end of every line except the
last.</p>

<p>age Date. Returns a human-readable date/time difference
between the given date/time and the current date/time.</p>

<p>basename Any text. Treats the text as a path, and
returns the last compo- nent of the path after splitting by
the path separator (ignoring trailing separators). For
example, &quot;foo/bar/baz&quot; becomes &quot;baz&quot; and
&quot;foo/bar//&quot; becomes &quot;bar&quot;.</p>

<p>stripdir Treat the text as path and strip a directory
level, if possible. For example, &quot;foo&quot; and
&quot;foo/bar&quot; becomes &quot;foo&quot;.</p>

<p>date Date. Returns a date in a Unix date format,
including the time- zone: &quot;Mon Sep 04 15:13:13 2006
0700&quot;.</p>

like an email address. Example: User
&lt;user@example.com&gt; becomes user@exam- ple.com.</p>

characters. For example, &quot;foo bar&quot; becomes
&quot;foo%20bar&quot;.</p>

<p>user Any text. Returns the user portion of an email
address.</p>

<p>URL PATHS Valid URLs are of the form:</p>

<p>local/filesystem/path[#revision]
file://local/filesystem/path[#revision]
http://[user[:pass]@]host[:port]/[path][#revision]
https://[user[:pass]@]host[:port]/[path][#revision]
ssh://[user[:pass]@]host[:port]/[path][#revision]</p>

<p>Paths in the local filesystem can either point to
Mercurial reposito- ries or to bundle files (as created by
&rsquo;hg bundle&rsquo; or &rsquo;hg incoming
--bundle&rsquo;).</p>

<p>An optional identifier after # indicates a particular
branch, tag, or changeset to use from the remote repository.
See also &rsquo;hg help revi- sions&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Some features, such as pushing to http:// and https://
URLs are only possible if the feature is explicitly enabled
on the remote Mercurial server.</p>

<p>Some notes about using SSH with Mercurial:</p>

<p>&middot; SSH requires an accessible shell account on the
destination machine and a copy of hg in the remote path or
specified with as remotecmd.</p>

<p>&middot; path is relative to the remote user&rsquo;s
home directory by default. Use an extra slash at the start
of a path to specify an absolute path:</p>

<p>ssh://example.com//tmp/repository</p>

<p>&middot; Mercurial doesn&rsquo;t use its own compression
via SSH; the right thing to do is to configure it in your
~/.ssh/config, e.g.:</p>

<p>Host *.mylocalnetwork.example.com Compression no Host *
Compression yes</p>

<p>Alternatively specify &quot;ssh -C&quot; as your ssh
command in your hgrc or with the --ssh command line
option.</p>

<p>These URLs can all be stored in your hgrc with path
aliases under the [paths] section like so:</p>

<p>[paths] alias1 = URL1 alias2 = URL2 ...</p>

<p>You can then use the alias for any command that uses a
URL (for example &rsquo;hg pull alias1&rsquo; will be
treated as &rsquo;hg pull URL1&rsquo;).</p>

<p>Two path aliases are special because they are used as
defaults when you do not provide the URL to a command:</p>

<p>default: When you create a repository with hg clone, the
clone command saves the location of the source repository as
the new reposi- tory&rsquo;s &rsquo;default&rsquo; path.
This is then used when you omit path from push- and
pull-like commands (including incoming and outgoing).</p>

<p>default-push: The push command will look for a path
named &rsquo;default-push&rsquo;, and prefer it over
&rsquo;default&rsquo; if both are defined.</p>

<p>USING ADDITIONAL FEATURES Mercurial has the ability to
add new features through the use of exten- sions. Extensions
may add new commands, add options to existing com- mands,
change the default behavior of commands, or implement
hooks.</p>

<p>Extensions are not loaded by default for a variety of
reasons: they can increase startup overhead; they may be
meant for advanced usage only; they may provide potentially
dangerous abilities (such as letting you destroy or modify
history); they might not be ready for prime time; or they
may alter some usual behaviors of stock Mercurial. It is
thus up to the user to activate extensions as needed.</p>

<p>To enable the &quot;foo&quot; extension, either shipped
with Mercurial or in the Python search path, create an entry
for it in your hgrc, like this:</p>

<p>[extensions] foo =</p>

<p>You may also specify the full path to an extension:</p>

<p>[extensions] myfeature = ~/.hgext/myfeature.py</p>

<p>To explicitly disable an extension enabled in an hgrc of
broader scope, prepend its path with !:</p>

<p>[extensions] # disabling extension bar residing in
/path/to/extension/bar.py hgext.bar =
!/path/to/extension/bar.py # ditto, but no path was supplied
for extension baz hgext.baz = !</p>

<p>disabled extensions:</p>

<p>acl hooks for controlling repository access</p>

<p>bookmarks track a line of development with movable
markers</p>

<p>bugzilla hooks for integrating with the Bugzilla bug
tracker</p>

<p>children command to display child changesets</p>

<p>churn command to display statistics about repository
history</p>

<p>color colorize output from some commands</p>

<p>convert import revisions from foreign VCS repositories
into Mercu- rial</p>

<p>extdiff command to allow external programs to compare
revisions</p>

<p>fetch pull, update and merge in one command</p>

<p>gpg commands to sign and verify changesets</p>

<p>graphlog command to view revision graphs from a
shell</p>

<p>hgcia hooks for integrating with the CIA.vc notification
service</p>

<p>hgk browse the repository in a graphical way</p>

<p>highlight syntax highlighting for hgweb (requires
Pygments)</p>

<p>inotify accelerate status report using Linux&rsquo;s
inotify service</p>

<p>interhg expand expressions into changelog and
summaries</p>

<p>keyword expand keywords in tracked files</p>

<p>mq manage a stack of patches</p>

<p>notify hooks for sending email notifications at
commit/push time</p>

<p>pager browse command output with an external pager</p>

<p>parentrevspec interpret suffixes to refer to ancestor
revisions</p>

<p>patchbomb command to send changesets as (a series of)
patch emails</p>

<p>purge command to delete untracked files from the working
directory</p>

<p>rebase command to move sets of revisions to a different
ancestor</p>

<p>record commands to interactively select changes for
commit/qrefresh</p>

<p>relink recreates hardlinks between repository clones</p>

<p>share share a common history between several working
directories</p>

<p>transplant command to transplant changesets from another
branch</p>

<p>win32mbcs allow the use of MBCS paths with problematic
encodings</p>

<p>win32text perform automatic newline conversion</p>

<p>zeroconf discover and advertise repositories on the
local network</p>

<p>FILES .hgignore</p>

<p>This file contains regular expressions (one per line)
that describe file names that should be ignored by hg. For
details, see hgignore(5).</p>

<p>.hgtags</p>

<p>This file contains changeset hash values and text tag
names (one of each separated by spaces) that correspond to
tagged versions of the repository contents.</p>

<p>/etc/mercurial/hgrc, $HOME/.hgrc, .hg/hgrc</p>

<p>This file contains defaults and configuration. Values in
.hg/hgrc override those in $HOME/.hgrc, and these override
set- tings made in the global /etc/mercurial/hgrc
configuration. See hgrc(5) for details of the contents and
format of these files.</p>

<p>Some commands (e.g. revert) produce backup files ending
in .orig, if the .orig file already exists and is not
tracked by Mercurial, it will be overwritten.</p>

<p>BUGS Probably lots, please post them to the mailing list
(see Resources below) when you find them.</p>
