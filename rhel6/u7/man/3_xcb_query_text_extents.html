<p>NAME xcb_query_text_extents - get text extents</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;xcb/xproto.h&gt;</p>

<p>Request function xcb_query_text_extents_cookie_t
xcb_query_text_extents(xcb_connection_t *conn,
xcb_fontable_t font, uint32_t string_len, const xcb_char2b_t
*string);</p>

<p>Reply datastructure typedef struct
xcb_query_text_extents_reply_t { uint8_t response_type;
uint8_t draw_direction; uint16_t sequence; uint32_t length;
int16_t font_ascent; int16_t font_descent; int16_t
overall_ascent; int16_t overall_descent; int32_t
overall_width; int32_t overall_left; int32_t overall_right;
} xcb_query_text_extents_reply_t;</p>

<p>Reply function xcb_query_text_extents_reply_t
*xcb_query_text_extents_reply(xcb_connection_t *conn,
xcb_query_text_extents_cookie_t cookie, xcb_generic_error_t
**e);</p>

<p>REQUEST ARGUMENTS conn The XCB connection to X11.</p>

<p>font The font to calculate text extents in. You can also
pass a graphics context.</p>

<p>string_len The number of characters in string.</p>

<p>string The text to get text extents for.</p>

<p>REPLY FIELDS response_type The type of this reply, in
this case XCB_QUERY_TEXT_EXTENTS. This field is also present
in the xcb_generic_reply_t and can be used to tell replies
apart from each other.</p>

<p>sequence The sequence number of the last request
processed by the X11 server.</p>

<p>length The length of the reply, in words (a word is 4
bytes).</p>

<p>draw_direction One of the following values:</p>

<p>XCB_FONT_DRAW_LEFT_TO_RIGHT TODO: NOT YET
DOCUMENTED.</p>

<p>XCB_FONT_DRAW_RIGHT_TO_LEFT TODO: NOT YET DOCUMENTED.
TODO: NOT YET DOCUMENTED.</p>

<p>font_ascent TODO: NOT YET DOCUMENTED.</p>

<p>font_descent TODO: NOT YET DOCUMENTED.</p>

<p>overall_ascent TODO: NOT YET DOCUMENTED.</p>

<p>overall_descent TODO: NOT YET DOCUMENTED.</p>

<p>overall_width TODO: NOT YET DOCUMENTED.</p>

<p>overall_left TODO: NOT YET DOCUMENTED.</p>

<p>overall_right TODO: NOT YET DOCUMENTED.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Query text extents from the X11 server. This
request returns the bound- ing box of the specified 16-bit
character string in the specified font or the font contained
in the specified graphics context.</p>

<p>font_ascent is set to the maximum of the ascent metrics
of all charac- ters in the string. font_descent is set to
the maximum of the descent metrics. overall_width is set to
the sum of the character-width met- rics of all characters
in the string. For each character in the string, let W be
the sum of the character-width metrics of all characters
pre- ceding it in the string. Let L be the left-side-bearing
metric of the character plus W. Let R be the
right-side-bearing metric of the charac- ter plus W. The
lbearing member is set to the minimum L of all charac- ters
in the string. The rbearing member is set to the maximum
R.</p>

<p>For fonts defined with linear indexing rather than
2-byte matrix index- ing, each xcb_char2b_t structure is
interpreted as a 16-bit number with byte1 as the most
significant byte. If the font has no defined default
character, undefined characters in the string are taken to
have all ze- ro metrics.</p>

<p>Characters with all zero metrics are ignored. If the
font has no de- fined default_char, the undefined characters
in the string are also ig- nored.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Returns an xcb_query_text_extents_cookie_t.
Errors have to be handled when calling the reply function
xcb_query_text_extents_reply.</p>

<p>If you want to handle errors in the event loop instead,
use xcb_query_text_extents_unchecked. See xcb-requests(3)
for details.</p>

<p>ERRORS xcb_font_error_t The specified font does not
exist.</p>

<p>xcb_gc_error_t The specified graphics context does not
exist.</p>
