either, symbolic links are preferred.
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION There are several reasons for calling the
Tcl_FS API functions (e.g. Tcl_FSAccess and Tcl_FSStat)
rather than calling system level functions like access and
stat directly. First, they will work cross-platform, so an
extension which calls them should work unmodified on Unix
and Windows. Second, the Windows implementation of some of
these functions fixes some bugs in the system level calls.
Third, these function calls deal with any Utf to
platform-native path conversions which may be required (and
may cache the results of such conversions for greater
efficiency on subsequent calls). Fourth, and perhaps most
importantly, all of these functions are virtual filesystem
aware . Any virtual filesystem (VFS for short) which has
been registered (through Tcl_FSRegister) may reroute file
access to alternative media or access methods. This means
that all of these functions (and therefore the corresponding
file, glob, pwd, cd, open, etc. Tcl commands) may be operate
on files which are not native files in the native
filesystem. This also means that any Tcl extension which
accesses the filesystem (FS for short) through this API is
automatically virtual filesystem aware. Of course, if an
extension accesses the native filesystem directly (through
platform-specific APIs, for example), then Tcl cannot
intercept such calls.</p>

<p>If appropriate VFSes have been registered, the files
may, to give two examples, be remote (e.g. situated on a
remote ftp server) or archived (e.g. lying inside a .zip
archive). Such registered filesystems pro- vide a lookup
table of functions to implement all or some of the func-
tionality listed here. Finally, the Tcl_FSStat and
Tcl_FSLstat calls abstract away from what the struct stat
buffer is actually declared to be, allowing the same code to
be used both on systems with and sys- tems without support
for files larger than 2GB in size.</p>

<p>The Tcl_FS API is objectified and may cache internal
representations and other path-related strings (e.g. the
current working directory). One side-effect of this is that
one must not pass in objects with a reference count of zero
to any of these functions. If such calls were handled, they
might result in memory leaks (under some circumstances, the
filesystem code may wish to retain a reference to the passed
in object, and so one must not assume that after any of
these calls return, the object still has a reference count
of zero - it may have been incremented) or in a direct
segmentation fault (or other memory access error) due to the
object being freed part way through the com- plex object
manipulation required to ensure that the path is fully nor-
malized and absolute for filesystem determination. The
practical les- son to learn from this is that Tcl_Obj *path
= Tcl_NewStringObj(...); Tcl_FSWhatever(path);
Tcl_DecrRefCount(path); is wrong, and may cause memory
errors. The path must have its reference count incremented
before passing it in, or decrementing it. For this reason,
objects with a reference count of zero are considered not to
be valid filesystem paths and calling any Tcl_FS API
function with such an object will result in no action being
taken.</p>

<p>FS API FUNCTIONS Tcl_FSCopyFile attempts to copy the
file given by srcPathPtr to the path name given by
destPathPtr. If the two paths given lie in the same
filesystem (according to Tcl_FSGetFileSystemForPath) then
that filesys- tems copy file function is called (if it is
non-NULL). Otherwise the function returns -1 and sets the
errno global C variable to the EXDEV POSIX error code (which
signifies a cross-domain link).</p>

<p>Tcl_FSCopyDirectory attempts to copy the directory given
by srcPathPtr to the path name given by destPathPtr. If the
two paths given lie in the same filesystem (according to
Tcl_FSGetFileSystemForPath) then that filesystems copy file
function is called (if it is non-NULL). Oth- erwise the
function returns -1 and sets the errno global C variable to
the EXDEV POSIX error code (which signifies a cross-domain
link).</p>

<p>Tcl_FSCreateDirectory attempts to create the directory
given by pathPtr by calling the owning filesystem s create
directory function.</p>

<p>Tcl_FSDeleteFile attempts to delete the file given by
pathPtr by call- ing the owning filesystems delete file
function.</p>

<p>Tcl_FSRemoveDirectory attempts to remove the directory
given by pathPtr by calling the owning filesystem s remove
directory function.</p>

<p>Tcl_FSRenameFile attempts to rename the file or
directory given by src- PathPtr to the path name given by
destPathPtr. If the two paths given lie in the same
filesystem (according to Tcl_FSGetFileSystemForPath) then
that filesystems rename file function is called (if it is
non- NULL). Otherwise the function returns -1 and sets the
errno global C variable to the EXDEV POSIX error code (which
signifies a cross- domain link).</p>

<p>Tcl_FSListVolumes calls each filesystem which has a
non-NULL list vol- umes function and asks them to return
their list of root volumes. It accumulates the return values
in a list which is returned to the caller (with a reference
count of 0).</p>

<p>Tcl_FSEvalFileEx reads the file given by pathPtr using
the encoding identified by encodingName and evaluates its
contents as a Tcl script. It returns the same information as
Tcl_EvalObjEx. If encodingName is NULL, the system encoding
is used for reading the file contents. If the file could not
be read then a Tcl error is returned to describe why the
file could not be read. The eofchar for files is 32 (^Z) for
all platforms. If you require a ^Z in code for string
comparison, you can use 32 or 001a, which will be safely
substituted by the Tcl interpreter into ^Z. Tcl_FSEvalFile
is a simpler version of Tcl_FSEvalFileEx that always uses
the system encoding when reading the file.</p>

<p>Tcl_FSLoadFile dynamically loads a binary code file into
memory and returns the addresses of two procedures within
that file, if they are defined. The appropriate function for
the filesystem to which pathPtr belongs will be called. If
that filesystem does not implement this function (most
virtual filesystems will not, because of OS limitations in
dynamically loading binary code), Tcl will attempt to copy
the file to a temporary directory and load that temporary
file.</p>

<p>Returns a standard Tcl completion code. If an error
occurs, an error message is left in the interps result.</p>

<p>Tcl_FSMatchInDirectory is used by the globbing code to
search a direc- tory for all files which match a given
pattern. The appropriate func- tion for the filesystem to
which pathPtr belongs will be called.</p>

<p>The return value is a standard Tcl result indicating
whether an error occurred in globbing. Error messages are
placed in interp (unless interp is NULL, which is allowed),
but good results are placed in the resultPtr given.</p>

<p>Note that the glob code implements recursive patterns
internally, so this function will only ever be passed simple
patterns, which can be matched using the logic of string
match. To handle recursion, Tcl will call this function
frequently asking only for directories to be returned. A
special case of being called with a NULL pattern indicates
that the path needs to be checked only for the correct
type.</p>

<p>Tcl_FSLink replaces the library version of readlink, and
extends it to support the creation of links. The appropriate
function for the filesystem to which linkNamePtr belongs
will be called.</p>

<p>If the toPtr is NULL, a read link action is performed.
The result is a Tcl_Obj specifying the contents of the
symbolic link given by linkNamePtr, or NULL if the link
could not be read. The result is owned by the caller, which
should call Tcl_DecrRefCount when the result is no longer
needed. If the toPtr is not NULL, Tcl should create a link
of one of the types passed in in the linkAction flag. This
flag is an ORed combination of TCL_CREATE_SYMBOLIC_LINK and
TCL_CRE- ATE_HARD_LINK. Where a choice exists (i.e. more
than one flag is passed in), the Tcl convention is to prefer
symbolic links. When a link is successfully created, the
return value should be toPtr (which is therefore already
owned by the caller). If unsuccessful, NULL is returned.</p>

<p>Tcl_FSLstat fills the stat structure statPtr with
information about the specified file. You do not need any
access rights to the file to get this information but you
need search rights to all directories named in the path
leading to the file. The stat structure includes info
regard- ing device, inode (always 0 on Windows), privilege
mode, nlink (always 1 on Windows), user id (always 0 on
Windows), group id (always 0 on Windows), rdev (same as
device on Windows), size, last access time, last
modification time, and creation time.</p>

<p>If path exists, Tcl_FSLstat returns 0 and the stat
structure is filled with data. Otherwise, -1 is returned,
and no stat info is given.</p>

<p>Tcl_FSUtime replaces the library version of utime.</p>

<p>This returns 0 on success and -1 on error (as per the
utime documenta- tion). If successful, the function will
update the atime and mtime values of the file given.</p>

<p>Tcl_FSFileAttrsGet implements read access for the
hookable file attributes subcommand. The appropriate
function for the filesystem to which pathPtr belongs will be
called.</p>

<p>If the result is TCL_OK, then an object was placed in
objPtrRef, which will only be temporarily valid (unless
Tcl_IncrRefCount is called).</p>

<p>Tcl_FSFileAttrsSet implements write access for the
hookable file attributes subcommand. The appropriate
function for the filesystem to which pathPtr belongs will be
called.</p>

<p>Tcl_FSFileAttrStrings implements part of the hookable
file attributes subcommand. The appropriate function for the
filesystem to which path- Ptr belongs will be called.</p>

<p>The called procedure may either return an array of
strings, or may instead return NULL and place a Tcl list
into the given objPtrRef. Tcl will take that list and first
increment its reference count before using it. On completion
of that use, Tcl will decrement its reference count. Hence
if the list should be disposed of by Tcl when done, it
should have a reference count of zero, and if the list
should not be disposed of, the filesystem should ensure it
retains a reference count to the object.</p>

<p>Tcl_FSAccess checks whether the process would be allowed
to read, write or test for existence of the file (or other
filesystem object) whose name is pathname. If pathname is a
symbolic link on Unix, then per- missions of the file
referred by this symbolic link are tested.</p>

<p>On success (all requested permissions granted), zero is
returned. On error (at least one bit in mode asked for a
permission that is denied, or some other error occurred), -1
is returned.</p>

<p>Tcl_FSStat fills the stat structure statPtr with
information about the specified file. You do not need any
access rights to the file to get this information but you
need search rights to all directories named in the path
leading to the file. The stat structure includes info
regard- ing device, inode (always 0 on Windows), privilege
mode, nlink (always 1 on Windows), user id (always 0 on
Windows), group id (always 0 on Windows), rdev (same as
device on Windows), size, last access time, last
modification time, and creation time.</p>

<p>If path exists, Tcl_FSStat returns 0 and the stat
structure is filled with data. Otherwise, -1 is returned,
and no stat info is given.</p>

<p>Tcl_FSOpenFileChannel opens a file specified by pathPtr
and returns a channel handle that can be used to perform
input and output on the file. This API is modeled after the
fopen procedure of the Unix stan- dard I/O library. The
syntax and meaning of all arguments is similar to those
given in the Tcl open command when opening a file. If an
error occurs while opening the channel,
Tcl_FSOpenFileChannel returns NULL and records a POSIX error
code that can be retrieved with Tcl_GetErrno. In addition,
if interp is non-NULL, Tcl_FSOpenFileChan- nel leaves an
error message in interps result after any error.</p>

<p>The newly created channel is not registered in the
supplied inter- preter; to register it, use
Tcl_RegisterChannel, described below. If one of the standard
channels, stdin, stdout or stderr was previously closed, the
act of creating the new channel also assigns it as a
replacement for the standard channel.</p>

<p>Tcl_FSGetCwd replaces the library version of getcwd.</p>

<p>It returns the Tcl librarys current working directory.
This may be different to the native platforms working
directory, which happens when the current working directory
is not in the native filesystem.</p>

<p>The result is a pointer to a Tcl_Obj specifying the
current directory, or NULL if the current directory could
not be determined. If NULL is returned, an error message is
left in the interps result.</p>

<p>The result already has its reference count incremented
for the caller. When it is no longer needed, that reference
count should be decre- mented. This is needed for
thread-safety purposes, to allow multiple threads to access
this and related functions, while ensuring the results are
always valid.</p>

<p>Tcl_FSChdir replaces the library version of chdir. The
path is normal- ized and then passed to the filesystem which
claims it. If that filesystem does not implement this
function, Tcl will fallback to a combination of stat and
access to check whether the directory exists and has
appropriate permissions.</p>

<p>For results, see chdir documentation. If successful, we
keep a record of the successful path in cwdPathPtr for
subsequent calls to Tcl_FSGetCwd.</p>

<p>Tcl_FSPathSeparator returns the separator character to
be used for most specific element of the path specified by
pathPtr (i.e. the last part of the path).</p>

<p>The separator is returned as a Tcl_Obj containing a
string of length 1. If the path is invalid, NULL is
returned.</p>

<p>Tcl_FSJoinPath takes the given Tcl_Obj, which must be a
valid list (which is allowed to have a reference count of
zero), and returns the path object given by considering the
first elements elements as valid path segments (each path
segment may be a complete path, a partial path or just a
single possible directory or file name). If any path segment
is actually an absolute path, then all prior path segments
are dis- carded. If elements is less than 0, we use the
entire list.</p>

<p>It is possible that the returned object is actually an
element of the given list, so the caller should be careful
to increment the reference count of the result before
freeing the list.</p>

<p>The returned object, typically with a reference count of
zero (but it could be shared under some conditions),
contains the joined path. The caller must add a reference
count to the object before using it. In particular, the
returned object could be an element of the given list, so
freeing the list might free the object prematurely if no
reference count has been taken. If the number of elements is
zero, then the returned object will be an empty-string
Tcl_Obj.</p>

<p>Tcl_FSSplitPath takes the given Tcl_Obj, which should be
a valid path, and returns a Tcl list object containing each
segment of that path as an element. It returns a list object
with a reference count of zero. If the passed in lenPtr is
non-NULL, the variable it points to will be updated to
contain the number of elements in the returned list.</p>

<p>Tcl_FSEqualPaths tests whether the two paths given
represent the same filesystem object</p>

<p>It returns 1 if the paths are equal, and 0 if they are
different. If either path is NULL, 0 is always returned.</p>

<p>Tcl_FSGetNormalizedPath this important function attempts
to extract from the given Tcl_Obj a unique normalized path
representation, whose string value can be used as a unique
identifier for the file.</p>

<p>It returns the normalized path object, owned by Tcl, or
NULL if the path was invalid or could otherwise not be
successfully converted. Extraction of absolute, normalized
paths is very efficient (because the filesystem operates on
these representations internally), although the result when
the filesystem contains numerous symbolic links may not be
the most user-friendly version of a path. The return value
is owned by Tcl and has a lifetime equivalent to that of the
pathPtr passed in (unless that is a relative path, in which
case the normalized path object may be freed any time the
cwd changes) - the caller can of course increment the
refCount if it wishes to maintain a copy for longer.</p>

<p>Tcl_FSJoinToPath takes the given object, which should
usually be a valid path or NULL, and joins onto it the array
of paths segments given.</p>

<p>Returns object, typically with refCount of zero (but it
could be shared under some conditions), containing the
joined path. The caller must add a refCount to the object
before using it. If any of the objects passed into this
function (pathPtr or path elements) have a refCount of zero,
they will be freed when this function returns.</p>

<p>Tcl_FSConvertToPathType tries to convert the given
Tcl_Obj to a valid Tcl path type, taking account of the fact
that the cwd may have changed even if this object is already
supposedly of the correct type. The filename may begin with
~ (to indicate current users home directory) or
~&lt;user&gt; (to indicate any users home directory).</p>

<p>If the conversion succeeds (i.e. the object is a valid
path in one of the current filesystems), then TCL_OK is
returned. Otherwise TCL_ERROR is returned, and an error
message may be left in the interpreter.</p>

<p>Tcl_FSGetInternalRep extracts the internal
representation of a given path object, in the given
filesystem. If the path object belongs to a different
filesystem, we return NULL. If the internal representation
is currently NULL, we attempt to generate it, by calling the
filesystems Tcl_FSCreateInternalRepProc.</p>

<p>Returns NULL or a valid internal path representation.
This internal representation is cached, so that repeated
calls to this function will not require additional
conversions.</p>

<p>Tcl_FSGetTranslatedPath attempts to extract the
translated path from the given Tcl_Obj.</p>

<p>If the translation succeeds (i.e. the object is a valid
path), then it is returned. Otherwise NULL will be returned,
and an error message may be left in the interpreter. A
translated path is one which contains no ~ or ~user
sequences (these have been expanded to their current
representation in the filesystem). The object returned is
owned by the caller, which must store it or call
Tcl_DecrRefCount to ensure memory is freed. This function is
of little practical use, and Tcl_FSGetNor- malizedPath or
Tcl_GetNativePath are usually better functions to use for
most purposes.</p>

<p>Tcl_FSGetTranslatedStringPath does the same as
Tcl_FSGetTranslatedPath, but returns a character string or
NULL. The string returned is dynami- cally allocated and
owned by the caller, which must store it or call ckfree to
ensure it is freed. Again, Tcl_FSGetNormalizedPath or
Tcl_GetNativePath are usually better functions to use for
most pur- poses.</p>

<p>Tcl_FSNewNativePath performs something like the reverse
of the usual obj-&gt;path-&gt;nativerep conversions. If some
code retrieves a path in native form (from, e.g. readlink or
a native dialog), and that path is to be used at the Tcl
level, then calling this function is an efficient way of
creating the appropriate path object type.</p>

<p>The resulting object is a pure path object, which will
only receive a UTF-8 string representation if that is
required by some Tcl code.</p>

<p>Tcl_FSGetNativePath is for use by the Win/Unix native
filesystems, so that they can easily retrieve the native
(char* or TCHAR*) representa- tion of a path. This function
is a convenience wrapper around Tcl_FSGetInternalRep, and
assumes the native representation is string- based. It may
be desirable in the future to have non-string-based native
representations (for example, on MacOSX, a representation
using a fileSpec of FSRef structure would probably be more
efficient). On Windows a full Unicode representation would
allow for paths of unlim- ited length. Currently the
representation is simply a character string which may
contain either the relative path or a complete, absolute
nor- malized path in the native encoding (complex conditions
dictate which of these will be provided, so neither can be
relied upon, unless the path is known to be absolute). If
you need a native path which must be absolute, then you
should ask for the native version of a normalized path. If
for some reason a non-absolute, non-normalized version of
the path is needed, that must be constructed separately
(e.g. using Tcl_FSGetTranslatedPath).</p>

<p>The native representation is cached so that repeated
calls to this function will not require additional
conversions. The return value is owned by Tcl and has a
lifetime equivalent to that of the pathPtr passed in (unless
that is a relative path, in which case the native
representation may be freed any time the cwd changes).</p>

<p>Tcl_FSFileSystemInfo returns a list of two elements. The
first element is the name of the filesystem (e.g. native,
vfs, zip, or prowrap, perhaps), and the second is the
particular type of the given path within that filesystem
(which is filesystem dependent). The sec- ond element may be
empty if the filesystem does not provide a further
categorization of files.</p>

<p>A valid list object is returned, unless the path object
is not recog- nized, when NULL will be returned.</p>

<p>Tcl_FSGetFileSystemForPath returns the a pointer to the
Tcl_Filesystem which accepts this path as valid.</p>

<p>If no filesystem will accept the path, NULL is
returned.</p>

<p>Tcl_FSGetPathType determines whether the given path is
relative to the current directory, relative to the current
volume, or absolute.</p>

<p>It returns one of TCL_PATH_ABSOLUTE, TCL_PATH_RELATIVE,
or TCL_PATH_VOLUME_RELATIVE</p>

<p>Tcl_AllocStatBuf allocates a Tcl_StatBuf on the system
heap (which may be deallocated by being passed to ckfree.)
This allows extensions to invoke Tcl_FSStat and Tcl_FSLStat
without being dependent on the size of the buffer. That in
turn depends on the flags used to build Tcl.</p>

<p>THE VIRTUAL FILESYSTEM API A filesystem provides a
Tcl_Filesystem structure that contains pointers to functions
that implement the various operations on a filesystem; these
operations are invoked as needed by the generic layer, which
gen- erally occurs through the functions listed above.</p>

<p>The Tcl_Filesystem structures are manipulated using the
following meth- ods.</p>

<p>Tcl_FSRegister takes a pointer to a filesystem structure
and an optional piece of data to associated with that
filesystem. On calling this function, Tcl will attach the
filesystem to the list of known filesystems, and it will
become fully functional immediately. Tcl does not check if
the same filesystem is registered multiple times (and in
general that is not a good thing to do). TCL_OK will be
returned.</p>

<p>Tcl_FSUnregister removes the given filesystem structure
from the list of known filesystems, if it is known, and
returns TCL_OK. If the filesystem is not currently
registered, TCL_ERROR is returned.</p>

<p>Tcl_FSData will return the ClientData associated with
the given filesystem, if that filesystem is registered.
Otherwise it will return NULL.</p>

<p>Tcl_FSMountsChanged is used to inform the Tcls core that
the set of mount points for the given (already registered)
filesystem have changed, and that cached file
representations may therefore no longer be correct.</p>

<p>THE TCL_FILESYSTEM STRUCTURE The Tcl_Filesystem
structure contains the following fields: typedef struct
Tcl_Filesystem { const char *typeName; int structureLength;
Tcl_FSVersion version; Tcl_FSPathInFilesystemProc
*pathInFilesystemProc; Tcl_FSDupInternalRepProc
*dupInternalRepProc; Tcl_FSFreeInternalRepProc
*freeInternalRepProc; Tcl_FSInternalToNormalizedProc
*internalToNormalizedProc; Tcl_FSCreateInternalRepProc
*createInternalRepProc; Tcl_FSNormalizePathProc
*normalizePathProc; Tcl_FSFilesystemPathTypeProc
*filesystemPathTypeProc; Tcl_FSFilesystemSeparatorProc
*filesystemSeparatorProc; Tcl_FSStatProc *statProc;
Tcl_FSAccessProc *accessProc; Tcl_FSOpenFileChannelProc
*openFileChannelProc; Tcl_FSMatchInDirectoryProc
*matchInDirectoryProc; Tcl_FSUtimeProc *utimeProc;
Tcl_FSLinkProc *linkProc; Tcl_FSListVolumesProc
*listVolumesProc; Tcl_FSFileAttrStringsProc
*fileAttrStringsProc; Tcl_FSFileAttrsGetProc
*fileAttrsGetProc; Tcl_FSFileAttrsSetProc *fileAttrsSetProc;
Tcl_FSCreateDirectoryProc *createDirectoryProc;
Tcl_FSRemoveDirectoryProc *removeDirectoryProc;
Tcl_FSDeleteFileProc *deleteFileProc; Tcl_FSCopyFileProc
*copyFileProc; Tcl_FSRenameFileProc *renameFileProc;
Tcl_FSCopyDirectoryProc *copyDirectoryProc; Tcl_FSLstatProc
*lstatProc; Tcl_FSLoadFileProc *loadFileProc;
Tcl_FSGetCwdProc *getCwdProc; Tcl_FSChdirProc *chdirProc; }
Tcl_Filesystem;</p>

<p>Except for the first three fields in this structure
which contain sim- ple data elements, all entries contain
addresses of functions called by the generic filesystem
layer to perform the complete range of filesys- tem related
actions.</p>

<p>The many functions in this structure are broken down
into three cate- gories: infrastructure functions (almost
all of which must be imple- mented), operational functions
(which must be implemented if a complete filesystem is
provided), and efficiency functions (which need only be
implemented if they can be done so efficiently, or if they
have side- effects which are required by the filesystem; Tcl
has less efficient emulations it can fall back on). It is
important to note that, in the current version of Tcl, most
of these fallbacks are only used to handle commands
initiated in Tcl, not in C. What this means is, that if a
file rename command is issued in Tcl, and the relevant
filesystem(s) do not implement their Tcl_FSRenameFileProc,
Tcl s core will instead fallback on a combination of other
filesystem functions (it will use Tcl_FSCopy- FileProc
followed by Tcl_FSDeleteFileProc, and if Tcl_FSCopyFileProc
is not implemented there is a further fallback). However, if
a Tcl_FSRe- nameFileProc command is issued at the C level,
no such fallbacks occur. This is true except for the last
four entries in the filesystem table (lstat, load, getcwd
and chdir) for which fallbacks do in fact occur at the C
level.</p>

<p>Any functions which take path names in Tcl_Obj form take
those names in UTF-8 form. The filesystem infrastructure API
is designed to support efficient, cached conversion of these
UTF-8 paths to other native rep- resentations.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE FILESYSTEM DEFINITION Here is the filesystem
lookup table used by the vfs extension which allows
filesystem actions to be implemented in Tcl. static
Tcl_Filesystem vfsFilesystem = { &quot;tclvfs&quot;,
sizeof(Tcl_Filesystem), TCL_FILESYSTEM_VERSION_1,
&amp;VfsPathInFilesystem, &amp;VfsDupInternalRep,
&amp;VfsFreeInternalRep, /* No internal to normalized, since
we don t create * any pure internal Tcl_Obj path
representations */ NULL, /* No create native rep function,
since we dont use * it and dont choose to support uses of *
Tcl_FSNewNativePath */ NULL, /* Normalize path isnt needed -
we assume paths only * have one representation */ NULL,
&amp;VfsFilesystemPathType, &amp;VfsFilesystemSeparator,
&amp;VfsStat, &amp;VfsAccess, &amp;VfsOpenFileChannel,
&amp;VfsMatchInDirectory, &amp;VfsUtime, /* We choose not to
support symbolic links inside our * VFSs */ NULL,
&amp;VfsListVolumes, &amp;VfsFileAttrStrings,
&amp;VfsFileAttrsGet, &amp;VfsFileAttrsSet,
&amp;VfsCreateDirectory, &amp;VfsRemoveDirectory,
&amp;VfsDeleteFile, /* No copy file; use the core fallback
mechanism */ NULL, /* No rename file; use the core fallback
mechanism */ NULL, /* No copy directory; use the core
fallback mechanism */ NULL, /* Core will use stat for lstat
*/ NULL, /* No load; use the core fallback mechansism */
NULL, /* We don t need a getcwd or chdir; the cores own *
internal value is suitable */ NULL, NULL };</p>

<p>FILESYSTEM INFRASTRUCTURE These fields contain basic
information about the filesystem structure and addresses of
functions which are used to associate a particular
filesystem with a file path, and deal with the internal
handling of path representations, for example copying and
freeing such representa- tions.</p>

<p>TYPENAME The typeName field contains a null-terminated
string that identifies the type of the filesystem
implemented, e.g. native, zip or vfs.</p>

<p>STRUCTURE LENGTH The structureLength field is generally
implemented as sizeof(Tcl_Filesystem), and is there to allow
easier binary backwards compatibility if the size of the
structure changes in a future Tcl release.</p>

<p>VERSION The version field should be set to
TCL_FILESYSTEM_VERSION_1.</p>

<p>PATHINFILESYSTEMPROC The pathInFilesystemProc field
contains the address of a function which is called to
determine whether a given path object belongs to this
filesystem or not. Tcl will only call the rest of the
filesystem func- tions with a path for which this function
has returned TCL_OK. If the path does not belong, -1 should
be returned (the behaviour of Tcl for any other return value
is not defined). If TCL_OK is returned, then the optional
clientDataPtr output parameter can be used to return an
internal (filesystem specific) representation of the path,
which will be cached inside the path object, and may be
retrieved efficiently by the other filesystem functions. Tcl
will simultaneously cache the fact that this path belongs to
this filesystem. Such caches are invalidated when filesystem
structures are added or removed from Tcls internal list of
known filesystems.</p>

<p>typedef int Tcl_FSPathInFilesystemProc( Tcl_Obj
*pathPtr, ClientData *clientDataPtr);</p>

<p>DUPINTERNALREPPROC This function makes a copy of a path
s internal representation, and is called when Tcl needs to
duplicate a path object. If NULL, Tcl will simply not copy
the internal representation, which may then need to be
regenerated later.</p>

<p>typedef ClientData Tcl_FSDupInternalRepProc( ClientData
clientData);</p>

<p>FREEINTERNALREPPROC Free the internal representation.
This must be implemented if internal representations need
freeing (i.e. if some memory is allocated when an internal
representation is generated), but may otherwise be NULL.</p>

<p>typedef void Tcl_FSFreeInternalRepProc( ClientData
clientData);</p>

<p>INTERNALTONORMALIZEDPROC Function to convert internal
representation to a normalized path. Only required if the
filesystem creates pure path objects with no string/path
representation. The return value is a Tcl object whose
string representation is the normalized path.</p>

<p>typedef Tcl_Obj* Tcl_FSInternalToNormalizedProc(
ClientData clientData);</p>

<p>CREATEINTERNALREPPROC Function to take a path object,
and calculate an internal representa- tion for it, and store
that native representation in the object. May be NULL if
paths have no internal representation, or if the
Tcl_FSPathInFilesystemProc for this filesystem always
immediately cre- ates an internal representation for paths
it accepts.</p>

<p>typedef ClientData Tcl_FSCreateInternalRepProc( Tcl_Obj
*pathPtr);</p>

<p>NORMALIZEPATHPROC Function to normalize a path. Should
be implemented for all filesys- tems which can have multiple
string representations for the same path object. In Tcl,
every path must have a single unique normalized string
representation. Depending on the filesystem, there may be
more than one unnormalized string representation which
refers to that path (e.g. a relative path, a path with
different character case if the filesystem is case
insensitive, a path contain a reference to a home directory
such as ~, a path containing symbolic links, etc). If the
very last component in the path is a symbolic link, it
should not be converted into the object it points to (but
its case or other aspects should be made unique). All other
path components should be converted from symbolic links.
This one exception is required to agree with Tcl s semantics
with file delete, file rename, file copy operating on
symbolic links. This function may be called with
nextCheckpoint either at the beginning of the path (i.e.
zero), at the end of the path, or at any intermediate file
separator in the path. It will never point to any other
arbitrary position in the path. In the last of the three
valid cases, the implementation can assume that the path up
to and including the file separator is known and
normalized.</p>

<p>typedef int Tcl_FSNormalizePathProc( Tcl_Interp *interp,
Tcl_Obj *pathPtr, int nextCheckpoint);</p>

<p>FILESYSTEM OPERATIONS The fields in this section of the
structure contain addresses of func- tions which are called
to carry out the basic filesystem operations. A filesystem
which expects to be used with the complete standard Tcl com-
mand set must implement all of these. If some of them are
not imple- mented, then certain Tcl commands may fail when
operating on paths within that filesystem. However, in some
instances this may be desir- able (for example, a read-only
filesystem should not implement the last four functions, and
a filesystem which does not support symbolic links need not
implement the readlink function, etc. The Tcl core expects
filesystems to behave in this way).</p>

<p>FILESYSTEMPATHTYPEPROC Function to determine the type of
a path in this filesystem. May be NULL, in which case no
type information will be available to users of the
filesystem. The type is used only for informational
purposes, and should be returned as the string
representation of the Tcl_Obj which is returned. A typical
return value might be networked, zip or ftp. The Tcl_Obj
result is owned by the filesystem and so Tcl will increment
the refCount of that object if it wishes to retain a
reference to it.</p>

<p>typedef Tcl_Obj* Tcl_FSFilesystemPathTypeProc( Tcl_Obj
*pathPtr);</p>

<p>FILESYSTEMSEPARATORPROC Function to return the separator
character(s) for this filesystem. This need only be
implemented if the filesystem wishes to use a differ- ent
separator than the standard string /. Amongst other uses, it
is returned by the file separator command. The return value
should be an object with refCount of zero.</p>

<p>typedef Tcl_Obj* Tcl_FSFilesystemSeparatorProc( Tcl_Obj
*pathPtr);</p>

<p>STATPROC Function to process a Tcl_FSStat call. Must be
implemented for any reasonable filesystem, since many Tcl
level commands depend crucially upon it (e.g. file atime,
file isdirectory, file size, glob).</p>

<p>typedef int Tcl_FSStatProc( Tcl_Obj *pathPtr,
Tcl_StatBuf *statPtr);</p>

<p>The Tcl_FSStatProc fills the stat structure statPtr with
information about the specified file. You do not need any
access rights to the file to get this information but you
need search rights to all directo- ries named in the path
leading to the file. The stat structure includes info
regarding device, inode (always 0 on Windows), privilege
mode, nlink (always 1 on Windows), user id (always 0 on
Windows), group id (always 0 on Windows), rdev (same as
device on Windows), size, last access time, last
modification time, and creation time.</p>

<p>If the file represented by pathPtr exists, the
Tcl_FSStatProc returns 0 and the stat structure is filled
with data. Otherwise, -1 is returned, and no stat info is
given.</p>

<p>ACCESSPROC Function to process a Tcl_FSAccess call. Must
be implemented for any reasonable filesystem, since many Tcl
level commands depend crucially upon it (e.g. file exists,
file readable).</p>

<p>typedef int Tcl_FSAccessProc( Tcl_Obj *pathPtr, int
mode);</p>

<p>The Tcl_FSAccessProc checks whether the process would be
allowed to read, write or test for existence of the file (or
other filesystem object) whose name is in pathPtr. If the
pathname refers to a symbolic link, then the permissions of
the file referred by this symbolic link should be
tested.</p>

<p>On success (all requested permissions granted), zero is
returned. On error (at least one bit in mode asked for a
permission that is denied, or some other error occurred), -1
is returned.</p>

<p>OPENFILECHANNELPROC Function to process a
Tcl_FSOpenFileChannel call. Must be implemented for any
reasonable filesystem, since any operations which require
open or accessing a file s contents will use it (e.g. open,
encoding, and many Tk commands).</p>

<p>typedef Tcl_Channel Tcl_FSOpenFileChannelProc(
Tcl_Interp *interp, Tcl_Obj *pathPtr, int mode, int
permissions);</p>

<p>The Tcl_FSOpenFileChannelProc opens a file specified by
pathPtr and returns a channel handle that can be used to
perform input and output on the file. This API is modeled
after the fopen procedure of the Unix standard I/O library.
The syntax and meaning of all arguments is simi- lar to
those given in the Tcl open command when opening a file,
where the mode argument is a combination of the POSIX flags
O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY, etc. If an error occurs while opening
the channel, the Tcl_FSOpenFileChannelProc returns NULL and
records a POSIX error code that can be retrieved with
Tcl_GetErrno. In addition, if interp is non-NULL, the
Tcl_FSOpenFileChannelProc leaves an error message in interps
result after any error.</p>

<p>The newly created channel is not registered in the
supplied inter- preter; to register it, use
Tcl_RegisterChannel. If one of the standard channels, stdin,
stdout or stderr was previously closed, the act of creating
the new channel also assigns it as a replacement for the
stan- dard channel.</p>

<p>MATCHINDIRECTORYPROC Function to process a
Tcl_FSMatchInDirectory call. If not implemented, then glob
and recursive copy functionality will be lacking in the
filesystem (and this may impact commands like encoding names
which use glob functionality internally).</p>

<p>typedef int Tcl_FSMatchInDirectoryProc( Tcl_Interp*
interp, Tcl_Obj *resultPtr, Tcl_Obj *pathPtr, const char
*pattern, Tcl_GlobTypeData *types);</p>

<p>The function should return all files or directories (or
other filesys- tem objects) which match the given pattern
and accord with the types specification given. There are two
ways in which this function may be called. If pattern is
NULL, then pathPtr is a full path specification of a single
file or directory which should be checked for existence and
correct type. Otherwise, pathPtr is a directory, the
contents of which the function should search for files or
directories which have the cor- rect type. In either case,
pathPtr can be assumed to be both non-NULL and non-empty. It
is not currently documented whether pathPtr will have a file
separator at its end of not, so code should be flexible to
both possibilities.</p>

<p>The return value is a standard Tcl result indicating
whether an error occurred in the matching process. Error
messages are placed in interp, unless interp in NULL in
which case no error message need be generated; on a TCL_OK
result, results should be added to the resultPtr object
given (which can be assumed to be a valid unshared Tcl
list). The matches added to resultPtr should include any
path prefix given in pathPtr (this usually means they will
be absolute path specifications). Note that if no matches
are found, that simply leads to an empty result; errors are
only signaled for actual file or filesystem problems which
may occur during the matching process.</p>

<p>The Tcl_GlobTypeData structure passed in the types
parameter contains the following fields: typedef struct
Tcl_GlobTypeData { /* Corresponds to bcdpfls as in find -t
*/ int type; /* Corresponds to file permissions */ int perm;
/* Acceptable mac type */ Tcl_Obj *macType; /* Acceptable
mac creator */ Tcl_Obj *macCreator; } Tcl_GlobTypeData;</p>

<p>There are two specific cases which it is important to
handle correctly, both when types is non-NULL. The two cases
are when types-&gt;types &amp; TCL_GLOB_TYPE_DIR or
types-&gt;types &amp; TCL_GLOB_TYPE_MOUNT are true (and in
particular when the other flags are false). In the first of
these cases, the function must list the contained
directories. Tcl uses this to implement recursive globbing,
so it is critical that filesystems implement directory
matching correctly. In the second of these cases, with
TCL_GLOB_TYPE_MOUNT, the filesystem must list the mount
points which lie within the given pathPtr (and in this case,
pathPtr need not lie within the same filesystem - different
to all other cases in which this function is called).
Support for this is critical if Tcl is to have seamless
transitions between from one filesystem to another.</p>

<p>UTIMEPROC Function to process a Tcl_FSUtime call.
Required to allow setting (not reading) of times with file
mtime, file atime and the open-r/open- w/fcopy
implementation of file copy.</p>

<p>typedef int Tcl_FSUtimeProc( Tcl_Obj *pathPtr, struct
utimbuf *tval);</p>

<p>The access and modification times of the file specified
by pathPtr should be changed to the values given in the tval
structure.</p>

<p>The return value should be 0 on success and -1 on an
error, as with the system utime.</p>

<p>LINKPROC Function to process a Tcl_FSLink call. Should
be implemented only if the filesystem supports links, and
may otherwise be NULL.</p>

<p>typedef Tcl_Obj* Tcl_FSLinkProc( Tcl_Obj *linkNamePtr,
Tcl_Obj *toPtr, int linkAction);</p>

<p>If toPtr is NULL, the function is being asked to read
the contents of a link. The result is a Tcl_Obj specifying
the contents of the link given by linkNamePtr, or NULL if
the link could not be read. The result is owned by the
caller (and should therefore have its ref count incremented
before being returned). Any callers should call Tcl_Decr-
RefCount on this result when it is no longer needed. If
toPtr is not NULL, the function should attempt to create a
link. The result in this case should be toPtr if the link
was successful and NULL otherwise. In this case the result
is not owned by the caller (i.e. no ref count manipulation
on either end is needed). See the documentation for
Tcl_FSLink for the correct interpretation of the linkAction
flags.</p>

<p>LISTVOLUMESPROC Function to list any filesystem volumes
added by this filesystem. Should be implemented only if the
filesystem adds volumes at the head of the filesystem, so
that they can be returned by file volumes.</p>

<p>typedef Tcl_Obj* Tcl_FSListVolumesProc(void);</p>

<p>The result should be a list of volumes added by this
filesystem, or NULL (or an empty list) if no volumes are
provided. The result object is considered to be owned by the
filesystem (not by Tcl s core), but should be given a
refCount for Tcl. Tcl will use the contents of the list and
then decrement that refCount. This allows filesystems to
choose whether they actually want to retain a master list of
volumes or not (if not, they generate the list on the fly
and pass it to Tcl with a refCount of 1 and then forget
about the list, if yes, then they simply increment the
refCount of their master list and pass it to Tcl which will
copy the contents and then decrement the count back to where
it was).</p>

<p>Therefore, Tcl considers return values from this proc to
be read-only.</p>

<p>FILEATTRSTRINGSPROC Function to list all attribute
strings which are valid for this filesystem. If not
implemented the filesystem will not support the file
attributes command. This allows arbitrary additional
information to be attached to files in the filesystem. If it
is not implemented, there is no need to implement the get
and set methods.</p>

<p>typedef const char** Tcl_FSFileAttrStringsProc( Tcl_Obj
*pathPtr, Tcl_Obj** objPtrRef);</p>

<p>The called function may either return an array of
strings, or may instead return NULL and place a Tcl list
into the given objPtrRef. Tcl will take that list and first
increment its reference count before using it. On completion
of that use, Tcl will decrement its reference count. Hence
if the list should be disposed of by Tcl when done, it
should have a reference count of zero, and if the list
should not be disposed of, the filesystem should ensure it
returns an object with a refererence count of at least
one.</p>

<p>FILEATTRSGETPROC Function to process a
Tcl_FSFileAttrsGet call, used by file attributes.</p>

<p>typedef int Tcl_FSFileAttrsGetProc( Tcl_Interp *interp,
int index, Tcl_Obj *pathPtr, Tcl_Obj **objPtrRef);</p>

<p>Returns a standard Tcl return code. The attribute value
retrieved, which corresponds to the index th element in the
list returned by the Tcl_FSFileAttrStringsProc, is a Tcl_Obj
placed in objPtrRef (if TCL_OK was returned) and is likely
to have a reference count of zero. Either way we must either
store it somewhere (e.g. the Tcl result), or Incr/Decr its
reference count to ensure it is properly freed.</p>

<p>FILEATTRSSETPROC Function to process a
Tcl_FSFileAttrsSet call, used by file attributes. If the
filesystem is read-only, there is no need to implement
this.</p>

<p>typedef int Tcl_FSFileAttrsSetProc( Tcl_Interp *interp,
int index, Tcl_Obj *pathPtr, Tcl_Obj *objPtr);</p>

<p>The attribute value of the indexth element in the list
returned by the Tcl_FSFileAttrStringsProc should be set to
the objPtr given.</p>

<p>CREATEDIRECTORYPROC Function to process a
Tcl_FSCreateDirectory call. Should be imple- mented unless
the FS is read-only.</p>

<p>typedef int Tcl_FSCreateDirectoryProc( Tcl_Obj
*pathPtr);</p>

<p>The return value is a standard Tcl result indicating
whether an error occurred in the process. If successful, a
new directory should have been added to the filesystem in
the location specified by pathPtr.</p>

<p>REMOVEDIRECTORYPROC Function to process a
Tcl_FSRemoveDirectory call. Should be imple- mented unless
the FS is read-only.</p>

<p>typedef int Tcl_FSRemoveDirectoryProc( Tcl_Obj *pathPtr,
int recursive, Tcl_Obj **errorPtr);</p>

<p>The return value is a standard Tcl result indicating
whether an error occurred in the process. If successful, the
directory specified by pathPtr should have been removed from
the filesystem. If the recursive flag is given, then a
non-empty directory should be deleted without error. If this
flag is not given, then and the directory is non-empty a
POSIX EEXIST error should be signalled. If an error does
occur, the name of the file or directory which caused the
error should be placed in errorPtr.</p>

<p>DELETEFILEPROC Function to process a Tcl_FSDeleteFile
call. Should be implemented unless the FS is read-only.</p>

<p>typedef int Tcl_FSDeleteFileProc( Tcl_Obj *pathPtr);</p>

<p>The return value is a standard Tcl result indicating
whether an error occurred in the process. If successful, the
file specified by pathPtr should have been removed from the
filesystem. Note that, if the filesystem supports symbolic
links, Tcl will always call this function and not
Tcl_FSRemoveDirectoryProc when needed to delete them (even
if they are symbolic links to directories).</p>

<p>FILESYSTEM EFFICIENCY These functions need not be
implemented for a particular filesystem because the core has
a fallback implementation available. See each individual
description for the consequences of leaving the field
NULL.</p>

<p>LSTATPROC Function to process a Tcl_FSLstat call. If not
implemented, Tcl will attempt to use the statProc defined
above instead. Therefore it need only be implemented if a
filesystem can differentiate between stat and lstat
calls.</p>

<p>typedef int Tcl_FSLstatProc( Tcl_Obj *pathPtr,
Tcl_StatBuf *statPtr);</p>

<p>The behavior of this function is very similar to that of
the Tcl_FSStatProc defined above, except that if it is
applied to a sym- bolic link, it returns information about
the link, not about the target file.</p>

<p>COPYFILEPROC Function to process a Tcl_FSCopyFile call.
If not implemented Tcl will fall back on open-r, open-w and
fcopy as a copying mechanism. Therefore it need only be
implemented if the filesystem can perform that action more
efficiently.</p>

<p>typedef int Tcl_FSCopyFileProc( Tcl_Obj *srcPathPtr,
Tcl_Obj *destPathPtr);</p>

<p>The return value is a standard Tcl result indicating
whether an error occurred in the copying process. Note that,
destPathPtr is the name of the file which should become the
copy of srcPathPtr. It is never the name of a directory into
which srcPathPtr could be copied (i.e. the function is much
simpler than the Tcl level file copy subcommand). Note that,
if the filesystem supports symbolic links, Tcl will always
call this function and not copyDirectoryProc when needed to
copy them (even if they are symbolic links to directories).
Finally, if the filesystem determines it cannot support the
file copy action, calling Tcl_SetErrno(EXDEV) and returning
a non-TCL_OK result will tell Tcl to use its standard
fallback mechanisms.</p>

<p>RENAMEFILEPROC Function to process a Tcl_FSRenameFile
call. If not implemented, Tcl will fall back on a copy and
delete mechanism. Therefore it need only be implemented if
the filesystem can perform that action more effi-
ciently.</p>

<p>typedef int Tcl_FSRenameFileProc( Tcl_Obj *srcPathPtr,
Tcl_Obj *destPathPtr);</p>

<p>The return value is a standard Tcl result indicating
whether an error occurred in the renaming process. If the
filesystem determines it can- not support the file rename
action, calling Tcl_SetErrno(EXDEV) and returning a
non-TCL_OK result will tell Tcl to use its standard fall-
back mechanisms.</p>

<p>COPYDIRECTORYPROC Function to process a
Tcl_FSCopyDirectory call. If not implemented, Tcl will fall
back on a recursive file mkdir, file copy mechanism.
Therefore it need only be implemented if the filesystem can
perform that action more efficiently.</p>

<p>typedef int Tcl_FSCopyDirectoryProc( Tcl_Obj
*srcPathPtr, Tcl_Obj *destPathPtr, Tcl_Obj **errorPtr);</p>

<p>The return value is a standard Tcl result indicating
whether an error occurred in the copying process. If an
error does occur, the name of the file or directory which
caused the error should be placed in errorPtr. Note that,
destPathPtr is the name of the directory-name which should
become the mirror-image of srcPathPtr. It is not the name of
a directory into which srcPathPtr should be copied (i.e. the
func- tion is much simpler than the Tcl level file copy
subcommand). Finally, if the filesystem determines it cannot
support the directory copy action, calling
Tcl_SetErrno(EXDEV) and returning a non-TCL_OK result will
tell Tcl to use its standard fallback mechanisms.</p>

<p>LOADFILEPROC Function to process a Tcl_FSLoadFile call.
If not implemented, Tcl will fall back on a copy to
native-temp followed by a Tcl_FSLoadFile on that temporary
copy. Therefore it need only be implemented if the
filesystem can load code directly, or it can be implemented
simply to return TCL_ERROR to disable load functionality in
this filesystem entirely.</p>

<p>typedef int Tcl_FSLoadFileProc( Tcl_Interp *interp,
Tcl_Obj *pathPtr, Tcl_LoadHandle *handlePtr,
Tcl_FSUnloadFileProc *unloadProcPtr);</p>

<p>Returns a standard Tcl completion code. If an error
occurs, an error message is left in the interp s result. The
function dynamically loads a binary code file into memory.
On a successful load, the handlePtr should be filled with a
token for the dynamically loaded file, and the unloadProcPtr
should be filled in with the address of a procedure. The
unload procedure will be called with the given
Tcl_LoadHandle as its only parameter when Tcl needs to
unload the file. For example, for the native filesystem, the
Tcl_LoadHandle returned is currently a token which can be
used in the private TclpFindSymbol to access functions in
the new code. Each filesystem is free to define the
Tcl_LoadHandle as it requires. Finally, if the filesystem
determines it cannot support the file load action, calling
Tcl_SetErrno(EXDEV) and returning a non- TCL_OK result will
tell Tcl to use its standard fallback mechanisms.</p>

<p>UNLOADFILEPROC Function to unload a previously
successfully loaded file. If load was implemented, then this
should also be implemented, if there is any cleanup action
required.</p>

<p>typedef void Tcl_FSUnloadFileProc( Tcl_LoadHandle
loadHandle);</p>

<p>GETCWDPROC Function to process a Tcl_FSGetCwd call. Most
filesystems need not implement this. It will usually only be
called once, if getcwd is called before chdir. May be
NULL.</p>

<p>typedef Tcl_Obj* Tcl_FSGetCwdProc( Tcl_Interp
*interp);</p>

<p>If the filesystem supports a native notion of a current
working direc- tory (which might perhaps change independent
of Tcl), this function should return that cwd as the result,
or NULL if the current directory could not be determined
(e.g. the user does not have appropriate per- missions on
the cwd directory). If NULL is returned, an error message is
left in the interps result.</p>

<p>CHDIRPROC Function to process a Tcl_FSChdir call. If
filesystems do not imple- ment this, it will be emulated by
a series of directory access checks. Otherwise, virtual
filesystems which do implement it need only respond with a
positive return result if the pathPtr is a valid, accessible
directory in their filesystem. They need not remember the
result, since that will be automatically remembered for use
by Tcl_FSGetCwd. Real filesystems should carry out the
correct action (i.e. call the correct system chdir API).</p>

<p>typedef int Tcl_FSChdirProc( Tcl_Obj *pathPtr);</p>

<p>The Tcl_FSChdirProc changes the applications current
working directory to the value specified in pathPtr. The
function returns -1 on error or 0 on success.</p>
