<p>NAME multipathd - multipath daemon</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS multipathd [options]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The multipathd daemon is in charge of
checking for failed paths. When this happens, it will
reconfigure the multipath map the path belongs to, so that
this map regains its maximum performance and redundancy.</p>

<p>This daemon executes the external multipath config tool
when events occur. In turn, the multipath tool signals the
multipathd daemon when it is done with devmap
reconfiguration, so that it can refresh its failed path
list.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -d Forground Mode. Don t daemonize, and print
all messages to std- out and stderr.</p>

<p>-v level Verbosity level. Print additional information
while running mul- tipathd. A level of 0 means only print
errors. A level of 3 or greater prints debugging information
as well.</p>

<p>-k multipathd will enter interactive mode. From this
mode, the available commands can be viewed by entering
&quot;help&quot;. When you are finished entering commands,
press CTRL-D to quit.</p>

<p>COMMANDS The following commands can be used in
interactive mode:</p>

<p>list|show paths Show the paths that multipathd is
monitoring, and their state.</p>

<p>list|show paths format $format Show the paths that
multipathd is monitoring, using a format string with path
format wildcards.</p>

<p>list|show status Show the number of monitored paths in
each path checker state.</p>

<p>list|show maps|multipaths Show the multipath devices
that the multipathd is monitoring.</p>

<p>list|show daemon Show the current state of the
multipathd daemon</p>

<p>list|show maps|multipaths format $format Show the status
of all multipath devices that the multipathd is monitoring,
using a format string with multipath format wild- cards.</p>

<p>list|show maps|multipaths status Show the status of all
multipath devices that the multipathd is monitoring.</p>

<p>list|show maps|multipaths stats Show some statistics of
all multipath devices that the multi- pathd is
monitoring.</p>

<p>list|show maps|multipaths topology Show the current
multipath topology. Same as &quot;multipath -ll&quot;.</p>

<p>list|show topology Show the current multipath topology.
Same as &quot;multipath -ll&quot;.</p>

<p>list|show map|multipath $map topology Show topology of a
single multipath device specified by $map, e.g.
36005076303ffc56200000000000010aa. This map could be
obtained from &quot;list maps&quot;.</p>

<p>list|show wildcards Show the format wildcards used in
interactive commands taking $format</p>

<p>list|show config Show the currently used configuration,
derived from default val- ues and values specified within
the configuration file /etc/mul- tipath.conf.</p>

<p>list|show blacklist Show the currently used blacklist
rules, derived from default values and values specified
within the configuration file /etc/multipath.conf.</p>

<p>list|show devices Show all available block devices by
name including the informa- tion if they are blacklisted or
not.</p>

<p>add path $path Add a path to the list of monitored
paths. $path is as listed in /sys/block (e.g. sda).</p>

<p>remove|del path $path Stop monitoring a path. $path is
as listed in /sys/block (e.g. sda).</p>

<p>paths count Show the number of monitored paths, and
whether multipathd is currently handling a uevent.</p>

<p>add map|multipath $map Add a multipath device to the
list of monitored devices. $map can either be a
device-mapper device as listed in /sys/block (e.g. dm-0) or
it can be the alias for the multipath device (e.g. mpath1)
or the uid of the multipath device (e.g.
36005076303ffc56200000000000010aa).</p>

<p>remove|del map|multipath $map Stop monitoring a
multipath device.</p>

<p>resize map|multipath $map Resizes map $map to the given
size</p>

<p>switch|switchgroup map|multipath $map group $group Force
a multipath device to switch to a specific path group.
$group is the path group index, starting with 1.</p>

<p>reconfigure Reconfigures the multipaths. This should be
triggered automati- cally after any hotplug event.</p>

<p>suspend map|multipath $map Sets map $map into suspend
state.</p>

<p>resume map|multipath $map Resumes map $map from suspend
state.</p>

<p>fail path $path Sets path $path into failed state.</p>

<p>reinstate path $path Resumes path $path from failed
state.</p>

<p>disablequeueing maps|multipaths Disable queueing on all
multipath devices.</p>

<p>restorequeueing maps|multipaths Restore queueing on all
multipath devices.</p>

<p>disablequeueing map|multipath $map Disable queuing on
multipathed map $map</p>

<p>restorequeueing map|multipath $map Restore queuing on
multipathed map $map</p>

<p>forcequeueing daemon Forces multipathd into
queue_without_daemon mode, so that no_path_retry queueing
will not be disabled when the daemon stops</p>

<p>restorequeueing daemon Restores configured
queue_without_daemon mode</p>

<p>map|multipath $map setprstatus Enable persistent
reservation management on $map</p>

<p>map|multipath $map unsetprstatus Disable persistent
reservation management on $map</p>

<p>map|multipath $map getprstatus Get the current
persistent reservation management status of $map</p>

<p>quit|exit End interactive session.</p>
