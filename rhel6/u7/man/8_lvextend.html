<p>DESCRIPTION lvextend allows you to extend the size of a
logical volume. Extension of snapshot logical volumes (see
lvcreate(8) for information to create snapshots) is
supported as well. But to change the number of copies in a
mirrored logical volume use lvconvert(8).</p>

<p>OPTIONS See lvm(8) for common options.</p>

<p>-f, --force Proceed with size extension without
prompting.</p>

<p>-l, --extents
[+]LogicalExtentsNumber[%{VG|LV|PVS|FREE|ORIGIN}] Extend or
set the logical volume size in units of logical extents.
With the + sign the value is added to the actual size of the
logical volume and without it, the value is taken as an
absolute one. The total number of physical extents allocated
will be greater than this, for example, if the volume is
mir- rored. The number can also be expressed as a percentage
of the total space in the Volume Group with the suffix %VG,
relative to the existing size of the Logical Volume with the
suffix %LV, of the remaining free space for the specified
PhysicalVolume(s) with the suffix %PVS, as a percentage of
the remaining free space in the Volume Group with the suffix
%FREE, or (for a snap- shot) as a percentage of the total
space in the Origin Logical Volume with the suffix %ORIGIN.
The resulting value is rounded upward. N.B. In a future
release, when expressed as a percent- age with PVS, VG or
FREE, the number will be treated as an approximate upper
limit for the total number of physical extents to be
allocated (including extents used by any mirrors, for
example). The code may currently allocate more space than
you might otherwise expect.</p>

<p>-L, --size [+]LogicalVolumeSize[bBsSkKmMgGtTpPeE] Extend
or set the logical volume size in units of megabytes. A size
suffix of M for megabytes, G for gigabytes, T for ter-
abytes, P for petabytes or E for exabytes is optional. With
the + sign the value is added to the actual size of the
logical vol- ume and without it, the value is taken as an
absolute one.</p>

<p>-i, --stripes Stripes Gives the number of stripes for
the extension. Not applicable to LVs using the original
metadata LVM format, which must use a single value
throughout.</p>

<p>-I, --stripesize StripeSize Gives the number of
kilobytes for the granularity of the stripes. Not applicable
to LVs using the original metadata LVM format, which must
use a single value throughout. StripeSize must be 2^n (n = 2
to 9)</p>

<p>-n, --nofsck Do not perform fsck before extending
filesystem when filesystem requires it. You may need to use
--force to proceed with this option.</p>

<p>--noudevsync Disable udev synchronisation. The process
will not wait for notification from udev. It will continue
irrespective of any possible udev processing in the
background. You should only use this if udev is not running
or has rules that ignore the devices LVM2 creates.</p>

<p>-r, --resizefs Resize underlying filesystem together
with the logical volume using fsadm(8).</p>

<p>--use-policies Resizes the logical volume according to
configured policy. See lvm.conf(5) for some details.</p>

<p>Examples Extends the size of the logical volume
&quot;vg01/lvol10&quot; by 54MiB on physi- cal volume
/dev/sdk3. This is only possible if /dev/sdk3 is a member of
volume group vg01 and there are enough free physical extents
in it:</p>

<p>lvextend -L +54 /dev/vg01/lvol10 /dev/sdk3</p>

<p>Extends the size of logical volume
&quot;vg01/lvol01&quot; by the amount of free space on
physical volume /dev/sdk3. This is equivalent to specifying
&quot;-l +100%PVS&quot; on the command line:</p>

<p>lvextend /dev/vg01/lvol01 /dev/sdk3</p>

<p>Extends a logical volume &quot;vg01/lvol01&quot; by
16MiB using physical extents /dev/sda:8-9 and /dev/sdb:8-9
for allocation of extents:</p>

<p>lvextend -L+16M vg01/lvol01 /dev/sda:8-9
/dev/sdb:8-9</p>
