<p>devmap_name major minor devmap_name major:minor</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION dmsetup manages logical devices that use the
device-mapper driver. Devices are created by loading a table
that specifies a target for each sector (512 bytes) in the
logical device.</p>

<p>The first argument to dmsetup is a command. The second
argument is the logical device name or uuid.</p>

<p>Invoking the command as devmap_name is equivalent to
dmsetup info -c --noheadings -j major -m minor.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --addnodeoncreate Ensure /dev/mapper node exists
after dmsetup create.</p>

<p>--addnodeonresume Ensure /dev/mapper node exists after
dmsetup resume (default with udev).</p>

<p>--checks Perform additional checks on the operations
requested and report potential problems. Useful when
debugging scripts. In some cases these checks may slow down
operations noticeably.</p>

<p>-c|-C|--columns Display output in columns rather than as
Field: Value lines.</p>

<p>-h|--help Outputs a summary of the commands available,
optionally includ- ing the list of report fields (synonym
with help command).</p>

<p>--inactive When returning any table information from the
kernel report on the inactive table instead of the live
table. Requires kernel driver version 4.16.0 or above.</p>

<p>--manglename {none|hex|auto} Mangle any character not on
a whitelist using mangling_mode when processing
device-mapper device names and UUIDs. The names and UUIDs
are mangled on input and unmangled on output where the
mangling mode is one of: none (no mangling), hex (always do
the mangling) and auto (only do the mangling if not mangled
yet, do nothing if already mangled, error on mixed) Default
mode is auto. Character whitelist: 0-9, A-Z, a-z, #+-.:=@_.
This whitelist is also supported by udev. Any character not
on a whitelist is replaced with its hex value (two digits)
prefixed by Mangling mode could be also set through
DM_DEFAULT_NAME_MANGLING_MODE environment variable.</p>

<p>-j|--major major Specify the major number.</p>

<p>-m|--minor minor Specify the minor number.</p>

<p>-n|--notable When creating a device, dont load any
table.</p>

<p>--noheadings Suppress the headings line when using
columnar output.</p>

<p>--noopencount Tell the kernel not to supply the open
reference count for the device.</p>

<p>--noudevrules Do not allow udev to manage nodes for
devices in device-mapper directory.</p>

<p>--noudevsync Do not synchronise with udev when creating,
renaming or removing devices.</p>

<p>-o|--options Specify which fields to display.</p>

<p>--readahead [+]&lt;sectors&gt;|auto|none Specify read
ahead size in units of sectors. The default value is auto
which allows the kernel to choose a suitable value auto-
matically. The + prefix lets you specify a minimum value
which will not be used if it is smaller than the value
chosen by the kernel. The value none is equivalent to
specifying zero.</p>

<p>-r|--readonly Set the table being loaded read-only.</p>

<p>-S|--select Selection Display only rows that match
Selection criteria. All rows are displayed with the
additional &quot;selected&quot; column (-o selected) showing
1 if the row matches the Selection and 0 otherwise. The
Selection criteria are defined by specifying column names
and their valid values while making use of supported
comparison operators. As a quick help and to see full list
of column names that can be used in Selection and the set of
supported selection operators, check the output of dmsetup
info -c -S help command.</p>

<p>--table &lt;table&gt; Specify a one-line table directly
on the command line.</p>

<p>--udevcookie cookie Use cookie for udev synchronisation.
Note: Same cookie should be used for same type of operations
i.e. creation of multiple different devices. It s not
adviced to combine different opera- tions on the single
device.</p>

<p>-u|--uuid Specify the uuid.</p>

<p>-y|--yes Answer yes to all prompts automatically.</p>

<p>-v|--verbose [-v|--verbose] Produce additional
output.</p>

<p>--verifyudev If udev synchronisation is enabled, verify
that udev operations get performed correctly and try to fix
up the device nodes afterwards if not.</p>

<p>--version Display the library and kernel driver
version.</p>

<p>COMMANDS clear device_name Destroys the table in the
inactive table slot for device_name.</p>

<p>create device_name [-u uuid] [-n|--notable|--table
&lt;table&gt;|table_file]
[{--addnodeoncreate|--addnodeonresume}] [--readahead
[+]&lt;sec- tors&gt;|auto|none] Creates a device with the
given name. If table_file or &lt;table&gt; is supplied, the
table is loaded and made live. Otherwise a ta- ble is read
from standard input unless --notable is used. The optional
uuid can be used in place of device_name in subsequent
dmsetup commands. If successful a device will appear as
/dev/mapper/&lt;device-name&gt;. See below for information
on the ta- ble format.</p>

<p>deps [-o options] [device_name] Outputs a list of
devices referenced by the live table for the specified
device. Device names on output can be customised by
following options: devno (major and minor pair, used by
default), blkdevname (block device name), devname (map name
for device-mapper devices, equal to blkdevname
otherwise).</p>

<p>help [-c|-C|--columns] Outputs a summary of the commands
available, optionally includ- ing the list of report
fields.</p>

<p>info [device_name] Outputs some brief information about
the device in the form: State: SUSPENDED|ACTIVE, READ-ONLY
Tables present: LIVE and/or INACTIVE Open reference count
Last event sequence number (used by wait) Major and minor
device number Number of targets in the live table UUID</p>

<p>info -c|-C|--columns [--noheadings] [--separator
separator] [-o fields] [-O|--sort sort_fields] [device_name]
Output you can customise. Fields are comma-separated and
chosen from the following list: name, major, minor, attr,
open, seg- ments, events, uuid. Attributes are: (L)ive,
(I)nactive, (s)uspended, (r)ead-only, read-(w)rite. Precede
the list with + to append to the default selection of
columns instead of replacing it. Precede any sort_field with
- for a reverse sort on that column.</p>

<p>ls [--target target_type] [--exec command] [--tree] [-o
options] List device names. Optionally only list devices
that have at least one target of the specified type.
Optionally execute a command for each device. The device
name is appended to the supplied command. Device names on
output can be customised by following options: devno (major
and minor pair, used by default), blkdevname (block device
name), devname (map name for device-mapper devices, equal to
blkdevname otherwise). --tree displays dependencies between
devices as a tree. It accepts a comma-separate list of
options. Some specify the information displayed against each
node: device/nodevice; blkdevname; active, open, rw, uuid.
Others specify how the tree is dis- played: ascii, utf,
vt100; compact, inverted, notrunc.</p>

<p>load|reload device_name [--table
&lt;table&gt;|table_file] Loads &lt;table&gt; or table_file
into the inactive table slot for device_name. If neither is
supplied, reads a table from stan- dard input.</p>

<p>wipe_table device_name Wait for any I/O in-flight
through the device to complete, then replace the table with
a new table that fails any new I/O sent to the device. If
successful, this should release any devices held open by the
devices table(s).</p>

<p>message device_name sector message Send message to
target. If sector not needed use 0.</p>

<p>mknodes [device_name] Ensure that the node in
/dev/mapper for device_name is correct. If no device_name is
supplied, ensure that all nodes in /dev/mapper correspond to
mapped devices currently loaded by the device-mapper kernel
driver, adding, changing or removing nodes as necessary.</p>

<p>mangle [device_name] Ensure existing device-mapper
device name and UUID is in the correct mangled form
containing only whitelisted characters (supported by udev)
and do a rename if necessary. Any character not on the
whitelist will be mangled based on the --manglename setting.
Automatic rename works only for device names and not for
device UUIDs because the kernel does not allow changing the
UUID of active devices. Any incorrect UUIDs are reported
only and they must be manually corrected by deactivating the
device first and then reactivating it with proper mangling
mode used (see also --manglename).</p>

<p>remove [-f|--force] [--retry] [--deferred] device_name
Removes a device. It will no longer be visible to dmsetup.
Open devices cannot be removed, but adding --force will
replace the table with one that fails all I/O. --deferred
will enable deferred removal of open devices - the device
will be removed when the last user closes it. The deferred
removal feature is supported since version 4.27.0 of the
device-mapper driver available in upstream kernel version
3.13. (Use dmsetup version to check this.) If an attempt to
remove a device fails, perhaps because a process run from a
quick udev rule temporarily opened the device, the --retry
option will cause the operation to be retried for a few
seconds before failing. Do NOT combine --force and
--udevcookie, as udev may start to process udev rules in the
middle of error target replacement and result in
nondeterministic result.</p>

<p>remove_all [-f|--force] [--deferred] Attempts to remove
all device definitions i.e. reset the driver. This also runs
mknodes afterwards. Use with care! Open devices cannot be
removed, but adding --force will replace the table with one
that fails all I/O. --deferred will enable deferred removal
of open devices - the device will be removed when the last
user closes it. The deferred removal feature is supported
since version 4.27.0 of the device-mapper driver available
in upstream kernel version 3.13.</p>

<p>rename device_name new_name Renames a device.</p>

<p>rename device_name --setuuid uuid Sets the uuid of a
device that was created without a uuid. After a uuid has
been set it cannot be changed.</p>

<p>resume device_name
[{--addnodeoncreate|--addnodeonresume}] [--readahead
[+]&lt;sectors&gt;|auto|none] Un-suspends a device. If an
inactive table has been loaded, it becomes live. Postponed
I/O then gets re-queued for processing.</p>

<p>setgeometry device_name cyl head sect start Sets the
device geometry to C/H/S.</p>

<p>splitname device_name [subsystem] Splits given device
name into subsystem constituents. The default subsystem is
LVM. LVM currently generates device names by concatenating
the names of the Volume Group, Logical Volume and any
internal Layer with a hyphen as separator. Any hyphens
within the names are doubled to escape them. The precise
encod- ing might change without notice in any future
release, so we recommend you always decode using the current
version of this command.</p>

<p>status [--target target_type] [--noflush] [device_name]
Outputs status information for each of the devices targets.
With --target, only information relating to the specified
target type any is displayed. With --noflush, the thin
target (from version 1.3.0) doesn t commit any outstanding
changes to disk before reporting its statistics.</p>

<p>suspend [--nolockfs] [--noflush] device_name Suspends a
device. Any I/O that has already been mapped by the device
but has not yet completed will be flushed. Any further I/O
to that device will be postponed for as long as the device
is suspended. If there s a filesystem on the device which
sup- ports the operation, an attempt will be made to sync it
first unless --nolockfs is specified. Some targets such as
recent (October 2006) versions of multipath may support the
--noflush option. This lets outstanding I/O that has not yet
reached the device to remain unflushed.</p>

<p>table [--target target_type] [--showkeys] [device_name]
Outputs the current table for the device in a format that
can be fed back in using the create or load commands. With
--target, only information relating to the specified target
type is dis- played. Encryption keys are suppressed in the
table output for the crypt target unless the --showkeys
parameter is supplied.</p>

<p>targets Displays the names and versions of the
currently-loaded targets.</p>

<p>udevcomplete cookie Wake any processes that are waiting
for udev to complete pro- cessing the specified cookie.</p>

<p>udevcomplete_all [age_in_minutes] Remove all cookies
older than the specified number of minutes. Any process
waiting on a cookie will be resumed immediately.</p>

<p>udevcookies List all existing cookies. Cookies are
system-wide semaphores with keys prefixed by two predefined
bytes (0x0D4D).</p>

<p>udevcreatecookie Creates a new cookie to synchronize
actions with udev process- ing. The output is a cookie
value. Normally we dont need to create cookies since dmsetup
creates and destroys them for each action automatically.
However, we can generate one explicitly to group several
actions together and use only one cookie instead. We can
define a cookie to use for each relevant command by using
--udevcookie option. Alternatively, we can export this value
into the environment of the dmsetup process as
DM_UDEV_COOKIE variable and it will be used automatically
with all subsequent commands until it is unset. Invoking
this command will create system-wide semaphore that needs to
be cleaned up explicitly by calling udevreleasecookie
command.</p>

<p>udevflags cookie Parses given cookie value and extracts
any udev control flags encoded. The output is in environment
key format that is suit- able for use in udev rules. If the
flag has its symbolic name assigned then the output is
DM_UDEV_FLAG_&lt;flag_name&gt;=1,
DM_UDEV_FLAG&lt;flag_position&gt;=1 otherwise. Subsystem
udev flags don t have symbolic names assigned and these ones
are always reported as
DM_SUBSYSTEM_UDEV_FLAG&lt;flag_position&gt;=1 . There are 16
udev flags altogether.</p>

<p>udevreleasecookie [cookie] Waits for all pending udev
processing bound to given cookie value and clean up the
cookie with underlying semaphore. If the cookie is not given
directly, the command will try to use a value defined by
DM_UDEV_COOKIE environment variable.</p>

<p>version Outputs version information.</p>

<p>wait [--noflush] device_name [event_nr] Sleeps until the
event counter for device_name exceeds event_nr. Use -v to
see the event number returned. To wait until the next event
is triggered, use info to find the last event number. With
--noflush, the thin target (from version 1.3.0) doesnt
commit any outstanding changes to disk before reporting its
statistics.</p>

<p>TABLE FORMAT Each line of the table specifies a single
target and is of the form:</p>

<p>logical_start_sector num_sectors target_type
&lt;target_args&gt;</p>

<p>Simple target types and &lt;target_args&gt; include:</p>

<p>linear destination_device start_sector The traditional
linear mapping.</p>

<p>striped num_stripes chunk_size [destination
start_sector]+ Creates a striped area. e.g. striped 2 32
/dev/hda1 0 /dev/hdb1 0 will map the first chunk (16k) as
follows: LV chunk 1 -&gt; hda1, chunk 1 LV chunk 2 -&gt;
hdb1, chunk 1 LV chunk 3 -&gt; hda1, chunk 2 LV chunk 4
-&gt; hdb1, chunk 2 etc.</p>

<p>error Errors any I/O that goes to this area. Useful for
testing or for creating devices with holes in them.</p>

<p>zero Returns blocks of zeroes on reads. Any data written
is dis- carded silently. This is a block-device equivalent
of the /dev/zero character-device data sink described in
null(4).</p>

<p>More complex targets include:</p>

<p>crypt Transparent encryption of block devices using the
kernel crypto API.</p>

<p>delay Delays reads and/or writes to different devices.
Useful for testing.</p>

<p>flakey Creates a similar mapping to the linear target
but exhibits unreliable behaviour periodically. Useful for
simulating fail- ing devices when testing.</p>

<p>mirror Mirrors data across two or more devices.</p>

<p>multipath Mediates access through multiple paths to the
same device.</p>

<p>raid Offers an interface to the kernels software raid
driver, md.</p>

<p>snapshot Supports snapshots of devices.</p>

<p>To find out more about the various targets and their
table formats and status lines, please read the files in the
Documentation/device-mapper directory in the kernel source
tree. (Your distribution might include a copy of this
information in the documentation directory for the
device-mapper package.)</p>
