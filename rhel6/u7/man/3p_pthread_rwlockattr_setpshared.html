<p>PTHREAD_RWLOCKATTR_GETPSHARPOSIX)Programmer
sPTHREAD_RWLOCKATTR_GETPSHARED(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME pthread_rwlockattr_getpshared,
pthread_rwlockattr_setpshared - get and set the
process-shared attribute of the read-write lock attributes
object</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;</p>

<p>int pthread_rwlockattr_getpshared(const
pthread_rwlockattr_t * restrict attr, int *restrict
pshared); int
pthread_rwlockattr_setpshared(pthread_rwlockattr_t *attr,
int pshared);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pthread_rwlockattr_getpshared() function
shall obtain the value of the process-shared attribute from
the initialized attributes object referenced by attr. The
pthread_rwlockattr_setpshared() function shall set the
process-shared attribute in an initialized attributes object
referenced by attr.</p>

<p>The process-shared attribute shall be set to
PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED to permit a read-write lock to be
operated upon by any thread that has access to the memory
where the read-write lock is allocated, even if the
read-write lock is allocated in memory that is shared by
multiple processes. If the process-shared attribute is
PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE, the read-write lock shall only be
operated upon by threads created within the same process as
the thread that initialized the read-write lock; if threads
of differing processes attempt to operate on such a
read-write lock, the behavior is undefined. The default
value of the process-shared attribute shall be
PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE.</p>

<p>Additional attributes, their default values, and the
names of the asso- ciated functions to get and set those
attribute values are implementa- tion-defined.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, the
pthread_rwlockattr_getpshared() func- tion shall return zero
and store the value of the process-shared attribute of attr
into the object referenced by the pshared parameter.
Otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate the
error.</p>

<p>If successful, the pthread_rwlockattr_setpshared()
function shall return zero; otherwise, an error number shall
be returned to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The pthread_rwlockattr_getpshared() and
pthread_rwlockattr_setpshared() functions may fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The value specified by attr is invalid.</p>

<p>The pthread_rwlockattr_setpshared() function may fail
if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The new value specified for the attribute is
outside the range of legal values for that attribute.</p>

<p>These functions shall not return an error code of
[EINTR].</p>
