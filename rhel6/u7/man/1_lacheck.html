<p>LaCheck(1) LaCheck(1)</p>

<p>NAME lacheck - A consistency checker for LaTeX
documents.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS lacheck filename [ .tex ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION LaCheck is a general purpose consistency
checker for LaTeX documents. It reads a LaTeX document and
displays warning messages, if it finds bad sequences. It
should be noted, that the badness is very subjective.
LaCheck is designed to help find common mistakes in LaTeX
documents, especially those made by beginners.</p>

<p>The things checked are:</p>

<p>Mismatched groups (braces), environments and math mode
delimiters. When a mismatch is found, line numbers for both
start and end of the mismatch is given. The error messages
comes in pairs, one for the end match and one for the
beginning, marked with &lsquo;&lt;-&acute; and
&lsquo;-&gt;&acute; respec- tively.</p>

<p>Bad spacing including missing a &lsquo; &acute; after an
abbreviation, missing an &lsquo;@&acute; before a
punctuation mark in a paragraph that is ended by an capi-
tal letter, double spaces like &lsquo; &acute;, bad usage of
ellipsis (like using ... instead of ts, or using ts where
missing before a italic corrections before comma, point, or
italic text, italic correc- tion after normal text, missing
italic correction when switching from italic to normal text,
and double italic correction.</p>

<p>Badly placed punctuation marks around end of math mode
delimiters. This is, punctuation placed right after display
math end or punctuation placed right before text math end.
Sequences of whitespace followed by punctuation marks are
also caught.</p>

<p>Bad use of quotation characters, i.e. constructs like
&quot;&acute;word&quot; or &quot;word&lsquo;&quot; are
warned about, tabs in verbatim environments are caught,
certain TeX primitives are frowned upon, attempts to give
font speci- fiers arguments such as \m{text} are noted, and
use of @ in LaTeX macros are reported.</p>

<p>LaCheck will read files that are input using input or
include. Files with suffix &lsquo;.sty&acute; are omitted,
as they probably will cause LaCheck to crash.</p>

<p>LaCheck may be invoked from within Emacs(1) using
compile:</p>

<p>To run: M-x compile RET lacheck RET , and then C-x to
parse the mes- sages</p>

<p>OUTPUT The output is UNIX-error like, and may be parsed
using Emacs(1) compile mode. Here is a sample:</p>

<p>lacheck compiler &quot;/usr/mef/compiler.tex&quot;, line
34: missing &lsquo;\\ &acute; after &quot;etc.&quot;
&quot;/usr/mef/compiler.tex&quot;, line 179: double space at
&quot; ~&quot; &quot;/usr/mef/compiler.tex&quot;, line 186:
&lt;- unmatched &quot;}&quot;
&quot;/usr/mef/compiler.tex&quot;, line 181: -&gt; unmatched
&quot;$$&quot;</p>

<p>A control space &lsquo; &acute; should be inserted at
line 34, to prevent an end- of-sentence space. Also, at line
179, the first space of the sequence &quot; ~&quot; should
probably be deleted. The last two lines is an example, where
the user mistyped, and probably inserted an extra
&quot;}&quot; somewhere.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS Some special cases should be explained. In
cases where a sentence ends with something that LaCheck
thinks is an abbreviation an missing &lsquo; &acute; error
may also occur, if the following sentence begins with a
lowercase letter.</p>

<p>A mismatch error may cause more to follow, due to the
chosen algorithm. In such cases just correct the first error
and run LaCheck again</p>

<p>Braces, environments and math mode must be balanced
within a file.</p>

<p>LaCheck may be confused by unmatched stuff placed inside
verbatim-like environments called something else than
exactly &lsquo;verbatim&acute;.</p>

<p>BUGS LaCheck gets confused by advanced macros, is fooled
by simple macros, cant figure out if you use a non-standard
way to switch italic on or off, does not like TeX at all,
does not provide any options to turn off specific warnings,
and is at best a crude approximation.</p>

<p>Ideas for improvements and bug reports are very welcome.
Such should be directed to the maintainers, their email
address is &lt;auc- tex_mgr@sunsite.auc.dk&gt;.</p>
