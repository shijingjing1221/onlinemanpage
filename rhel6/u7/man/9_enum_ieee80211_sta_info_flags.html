<p>NAME enum_ieee80211_sta_info_flags - Stations flags</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS enum ieee80211_sta_info_flags { WLAN_STA_AUTH,
WLAN_STA_ASSOC, WLAN_STA_PS_STA, WLAN_STA_AUTHORIZED,
WLAN_STA_SHORT_PREAMBLE, WLAN_STA_WDS,
WLAN_STA_CLEAR_PS_FILT, WLAN_STA_MFP, WLAN_STA_BLOCK_BA,
WLAN_STA_PS_DRIVER, WLAN_STA_PSPOLL, WLAN_STA_TDLS_PEER,
WLAN_STA_TDLS_PEER_AUTH, WLAN_STA_TDLS_INITIATOR,
WLAN_STA_TDLS_CHAN_SWITCH, WLAN_STA_TDLS_OFF_CHANNEL,
WLAN_STA_UAPSD, WLAN_STA_SP, WLAN_STA_4ADDR_EVENT,
WLAN_STA_INSERTED, WLAN_STA_RATE_CONTROL,
WLAN_STA_TOFFSET_KNOWN, WLAN_STA_MPSP_OWNER,
WLAN_STA_MPSP_RECIPIENT, WLAN_STA_PS_DELIVER };</p>

<p>CONSTANTS WLAN_STA_AUTH Station is authenticated.</p>

<p>WLAN_STA_ASSOC Station is associated.</p>

<p>WLAN_STA_PS_STA Station is in power-save mode</p>

<p>WLAN_STA_AUTHORIZED Station is authorized to
send/receive traffic. This bit is always checked so needs to
be enabled for all stations when virtual port control is not
in use.</p>

<p>WLAN_STA_SHORT_PREAMBLE Station is capable of receiving
short-preamble frames.</p>

<p>WLAN_STA_WDS Station is one of our WDS peers.</p>

<p>WLAN_STA_CLEAR_PS_FILT Clear PS filter in hardware
(using the IEEE80211_TX_CTL_CLEAR_PS_FILT control flag) when
the next frame to this station is transmitted.</p>

<p>WLAN_STA_MFP Management frame protection is used with
this STA.</p>

<p>WLAN_STA_BLOCK_BA Used to deny ADDBA requests (both TX
and RX) during suspend/resume and station removal.</p>

<p>WLAN_STA_PS_DRIVER driver requires keeping this station
in power-save mode logically to flush frames that might
still be in the queues</p>

<p>WLAN_STA_PSPOLL Station sent PS-poll while driver was
keeping station in power-save mode, reply when the driver
unblocks.</p>

<p>WLAN_STA_TDLS_PEER Station is a TDLS peer.</p>

<p>WLAN_STA_TDLS_PEER_AUTH This TDLS peer is authorized to
send direct packets. This means the link is enabled.</p>

<p>WLAN_STA_TDLS_INITIATOR We are the initiator of the TDLS
link with this station.</p>

<p>WLAN_STA_TDLS_CHAN_SWITCH This TDLS peer supports TDLS
channel-switching</p>

<p>WLAN_STA_TDLS_OFF_CHANNEL The local STA is currently
off-channel with this TDLS peer</p>

<p>WLAN_STA_UAPSD Station requested unscheduled SP while
driver was keeping station in power-save mode, reply when
the driver unblocks the station.</p>

<p>WLAN_STA_SP Station is in a service period, so
don&acute;t try to reply to other uAPSD trigger frames or
PS-Poll.</p>

<p>WLAN_STA_4ADDR_EVENT 4-addr event was already sent for
this frame.</p>

<p>WLAN_STA_INSERTED This station is inserted into the hash
table.</p>

<p>WLAN_STA_RATE_CONTROL rate control was initialized for
this station.</p>

<p>WLAN_STA_TOFFSET_KNOWN toffset calculated for this
station is valid.</p>

<p>WLAN_STA_MPSP_OWNER local STA is owner of a mesh Peer
Service Period.</p>

<p>WLAN_STA_MPSP_RECIPIENT local STA is recipient of a
MPSP.</p>

<p>WLAN_STA_PS_DELIVER station woke up, but we&acute;re
still blocking TX until pending frames are delivered</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION These flags are used with struct
sta_info&acute;s flags member, but only indirectly with
set_sta_flag and friends.</p>
