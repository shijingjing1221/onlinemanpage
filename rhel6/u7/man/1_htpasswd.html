<p>HTPASSWD(1) htpasswd HTPASSWD(1)</p>

<p>NAME htpasswd - Manage user files for basic
authentication</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS htpasswd [ -c ] [ -m ] [ -D ] passwdfile
username</p>

<p>htpasswd -b [ -c ] [ -m | -d | -p | -s ] [ -D ]
passwdfile username password</p>

<p>htpasswd -n [ -m | -d | -s | -p ] username</p>

<p>htpasswd -nb [ -m | -d | -s | -p ] username password</p>

<p>SUMMARY htpasswd is used to create and update the
flat-files used to store usernames and password for basic
authentication of HTTP users. If htpasswd cannot access a
file, such as not being able to write to the output file or
not being able to read the file in order to update it, it
returns an error status and makes no changes.</p>

<p>Resources available from the Apache HTTP server can be
restricted to just the users listed in the files created by
htpasswd. This program can only manage usernames and
passwords stored in a flat-file. It can encrypt and display
password information for use in other types of data stores,
though. To use a DBM database see dbmmanage.</p>

<p>htpasswd encrypts passwords using either a version of
MD5 modified for Apache, or the systems crypt() routine.
Files managed by htpasswd may contain both types of
passwords; some user records may have MD5-encrypted
passwords while others in the same file may have pass- words
encrypted with crypt().</p>

<p>This manual page only lists the command line arguments.
For details of the directives necessary to configure user
authentication in httpd see the Apache manual, which is part
of the Apache distribution or can be found at
http://httpd.apache.org/.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -b Use batch mode; i.e., get the password from
the command line rather than prompting for it. This option
should be used with extreme care, since the password is
clearly visible on the com- mand line.</p>

<p>-c Create the passwdfile. If passwdfile already exists,
it is rewritten and truncated. This option cannot be
combined with the -n option.</p>

<p>-n Display the results on standard output rather than
updating a file. This is useful for generating password
records acceptable to Apache for inclusion in non-text data
stores. This option changes the syntax of the command line,
since the passwdfile argument (usually the first one) is
omitted. It cannot be com- bined with the -c option.</p>

<p>-m Use MD5 encryption for passwords. On Windows, Netware
and TPF, this is the default.</p>

<p>-d Use crypt() encryption for passwords. The default on
all plat- forms but Windows, Netware and TPF. Though
possibly supported by htpasswd on all platforms, it is not
supported by the httpd server on Windows, Netware and
TPF.</p>

<p>-s Use SHA encryption for passwords. Facilitates
migration from/to Netscape servers using the LDAP Directory
Interchange Format (ldif).</p>

<p>-p Use plaintext passwords. Though htpasswd will support
creation on all platforms, the httpd daemon will only accept
plain text passwords on Windows, Netware and TPF.</p>

<p>-D Delete user. If the username exists in the specified
htpasswd file, it will be deleted.</p>

<p>passwdfile Name of the file to contain the user name and
password. If -c is given, this file is created if it does
not already exist, or rewritten and truncated if it does
exist.</p>

<p>username The username to create or update in passwdfile.
If username does not exist in this file, an entry is added.
If it does exist, the password is changed.</p>

<p>password The plaintext password to be encrypted and
stored in the file. Only used with the -b flag.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS htpasswd returns a zero status
(&quot;true&quot;) if the username and password have been
successfully added or updated in the passwdfile. htpasswd
returns 1 if it encounters some problem accessing files, 2
if there was a syntax problem with the command line, 3 if
the password was entered interactively and the verification
entry didnt match, 4 if its opera- tion was interrupted, 5
if a value is too long (username, filename, password, or
final computed record), 6 if the username contains illegal
characters (see the Restrictions section), and 7 if the file
is not a valid password file.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES htpasswd /usr/local/etc/apache/.htpasswd-users
jsmith</p>

<p>Adds or modifies the password for user jsmith. The user
is prompted for the password. If executed on a Windows
system, the password will be encrypted using the modified
Apache MD5 algorithm; otherwise, the sys- tems crypt()
routine will be used. If the file does not exist, htpasswd
will do nothing except return an error.</p>

<p>htpasswd -c /home/doe/public_html/.htpasswd jane</p>

<p>Creates a new file and stores a record in it for user
jane. The user is prompted for the password. If the file
exists and cannot be read, or cannot be written, it is not
altered and htpasswd will display a mes- sage and return an
error status.</p>

<p>htpasswd -mb /usr/web/.htpasswd-all jones Pwd4Steve</p>

<p>Encrypts the password from the command line (Pwd4Steve)
using the MD5 algorithm, and stores it in the specified
file.</p>

<p>SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS Web password files such as those
managed by htpasswd should not be within the Web servers URI
space -- that is, they should not be fetch- able with a
browser.</p>

<p>This program is not safe as a setuid executable. Do not
make it setuid.</p>

<p>The use of the -b option is discouraged, since when it
is used the unencrypted password appears on the command
line.</p>

<p>When using the crypt() algorithm, note that only the
first 8 characters of the password are used to form the
password. If the supplied password is longer, the extra
characters will be silently discarded.</p>

<p>The SHA encryption format does not use salting: for a
given password, there is only one encrypted representation.
The crypt() and MD5 formats permute the representation by
prepending a random salt string, to make dictionary attacks
against the passwords more difficult.</p>

<p>RESTRICTIONS On the Windows and MPE platforms, passwords
encrypted with htpasswd are limited to no more than 255
characters in length. Longer passwords will be truncated to
255 characters.</p>

<p>The MD5 algorithm used by htpasswd is specific to the
Apache software; passwords encrypted using it will not be
usable with other Web servers.</p>

<p>Usernames are limited to 255 bytes and may not include
the character :.</p>
