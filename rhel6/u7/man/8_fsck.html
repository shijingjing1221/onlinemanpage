<p>NAME fsck - check and repair a Linux file system</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS fsck [-sAVRTMNP] [-C [fd]] [-t fstype]
[filesys...] [--] [fs-specific- options]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION fsck is used to check and optionally repair
one or more Linux file sys- tems. filesys can be a device
name (e.g. /dev/hdc1, /dev/sdb2), a mount point (e.g. /,
/usr, /home), or an ext2 label or UUID specifier (e.g.
UUID=8868abf6-88c5-4a83-98b8-bfc24057f7bd or LABEL=root).
Nor- mally, the fsck program will try to handle filesystems
on different physical disk drives in parallel to reduce the
total amount of time needed to check all of the
filesystems.</p>

<p>If no filesystems are specified on the command line, and
the -A option is not specified, fsck will default to
checking filesystems in /etc/fstab serially. This is
equivalent to the -As options.</p>

<p>The exit code returned by fsck is the sum of the
following conditions: 0 - No errors 1 - File system errors
corrected 2 - System should be rebooted 4 - File system
errors left uncorrected 8 - Operational error 16 - Usage or
syntax error 32 - Fsck canceled by user request 128 - Shared
library error The exit code returned when multiple file
systems are checked is the bit-wise OR of the exit codes for
each file system that is checked.</p>

<p>In actuality, fsck is simply a front-end for the various
file system checkers (fsck.fstype) available under Linux.
The file system-specific checker is searched for in /sbin
first, then in /etc/fs and /etc, and finally in the
directories listed in the PATH environment variable. Please
see the file system-specific checker manual pages for
further details.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -s Serialize fsck operations. This is a good
idea if you are checking multiple filesystems and the
checkers are in an inter- active mode. (Note: e2fsck(8) runs
in an interactive mode by default. To make e2fsck(8) run in
a non-interactive mode, you must either specify the -p or -a
option, if you wish for errors to be corrected
automatically, or the -n option if you do not.)</p>

<p>-t fslist Specifies the type(s) of file system to be
checked. When the -A flag is specified, only filesystems
that match fslist are checked. The fslist parameter is a
comma-separated list of filesystems and options specifiers.
All of the filesystems in this comma-separated list may be
prefixed by a negation operator no or ! , which requests
that only those filesystems not listed in fslist will be
checked. If all of the filesystems in fslist are not
prefixed by a negation operator, then only those filesystems
listed in fslist will be checked.</p>

<p>Options specifiers may be included in the
comma-separated fslist. They must have the format
opts=fs-option. If an options specifier is present, then
only filesystems which con- tain fs-option in their mount
options field of /etc/fstab will be checked. If the options
specifier is prefixed by a negation operator, then only
those filesystems that do not have fs-option in their mount
options field of /etc/fstab will be checked.</p>

<p>For example, if opts=ro appears in fslist, then only
filesystems listed in /etc/fstab with the ro option will be
checked.</p>

<p>For compatibility with Mandrake distributions whose boot
scripts depend upon an unauthorized UI change to the fsck
program, if a filesystem type of loop is found in fslist, it
is treated as if opts=loop were specified as an argument to
the -t option.</p>

<p>Normally, the filesystem type is deduced by searching
for filesys in the /etc/fstab file and using the
corresponding entry. If the type can not be deduced, and
there is only a sin- gle filesystem given as an argument to
the -t option, fsck will use the specified filesystem type.
If this type is not avail- able, then the default file
system type (currently ext2) is used.</p>

<p>-A Walk through the /etc/fstab file and try to check all
file sys- tems in one run. This option is typically used
from the /etc/rc system initialization file, instead of
multiple commands for checking a single file system.</p>

<p>The root filesystem will be checked first unless the -P
option is specified (see below). After that, filesystems
will be checked in the order specified by the fs_passno (the
sixth) field in the /etc/fstab file. Filesystems with a
fs_passno value of 0 are skipped and are not checked at all.
Filesystems with a fs_passno value of greater than zero will
be checked in order, with filesystems with the lowest
fs_passno number being checked first. If there are multiple
filesystems with the same pass number, fsck will attempt to
check them in parallel, although it will avoid running
multiple filesystem checks on the same physical disk.</p>

<p>fsck does not check stacked devices (RAIDs, dm-crypt,
...) in parallel with any other device. See below for
FSCK_FORCE_ALL_PARALLEL setting. The /sys filesystem is used
to detemine dependencies between devices.</p>

<p>Hence, a very common configuration in /etc/fstab files
is to set the root filesystem to have a fs_passno value of 1
and to set all other filesystems to have a fs_passno value
of 2. This will allow fsck to automatically run filesystem
checkers in parallel if it is advantageous to do so. System
administrators might choose not to use this configuration if
they need to avoid mul- tiple filesystem checks running in
parallel for some reason --- for example, if the machine in
question is short on memory so that excessive paging is a
concern.</p>

<p>fsck normally does not check whether the device actually
exists before calling a file system specific checker.
Therefore non- existing devices may cause the system to
enter file system repair mode during boot if the filesystem
specific checker returns a fatal error. The /etc/fstab mount
option nofail may be used to have fsck skip non-existing
devices. fsck also skips non-existing devices that have the
special file system type auto</p>

<p>-C [ fd ] Display completion/progress bars for those
filesystem checkers (currently only for ext2 and ext3) which
support them. Fsck will manage the filesystem checkers so
that only one of them will display a progress bar at a time.
GUI front-ends may spec- ify a file descriptor fd, in which
case the progress bar information will be sent to that file
descriptor.</p>

<p>-M Do not check mounted filesystems and return an exit
code of 0 for mounted filesystems.</p>

<p>-N Dont execute, just show what would be done.</p>

<p>-P When the -A flag is set, check the root filesystem in
parallel with the other filesystems. This is not the safest
thing in the world to do, since if the root filesystem is in
doubt things like the e2fsck(8) executable might be
corrupted! This option is mainly provided for those
sysadmins who don t want to repar- tition the root
filesystem to be small and compact (which is really the
right solution).</p>

<p>-R When checking all file systems with the -A flag, skip
the root file system (in case it s already mounted
read-write).</p>

<p>-T Dont show the title on startup.</p>

<p>-V Produce verbose output, including all file
system-specific com- mands that are executed.</p>

<p>fs-specific-options Options which are not understood by
fsck are passed to the filesystem-specific checker. These
arguments must not take arguments, as there is no way for
fsck to be able to properly guess which arguments take
options and which don t.</p>

<p>Options and arguments which follow the -- are treated as
file system-specific options to be passed to the file
system-specific checker.</p>

<p>Please note that fsck is not designed to pass
arbitrarily com- plicated options to filesystem-specific
checkers. If youre doing something complicated, please just
execute the filesystem- specific checker directly. If you
pass fsck some horribly com- plicated option and arguments,
and it doesnt do what you expect, dot bother reporting it as
a bug. You re almost cer- tainly doing something that you
shouldnt be doing with fsck.</p>

<p>Options to different filesystem-specific fsck s are not
standardized. If in doubt, please consult the man pages of
the filesystem-specific checker. Although not guaranteed,
the following options are supported by most file system
checkers:</p>

<p>-a Automatically repair the file system without any
questions (use this option with caution). Note that
e2fsck(8) supports -a for backwards compatibility only. This
option is mapped to e2fscks -p option which is safe to use,
unlike the -a option that some file system checkers
support.</p>

<p>-n For some filesystem-specific checkers, the -n option
will cause the fs-specific fsck to avoid attempting to
repair any problems, but simply report such problems to
stdout. This is however not true for all filesystem-specific
checkers. In particular, fsck.reiserfs(8) will not report
any corruption if given this option. fsck.minix(8) does not
support the -n option at all.</p>

<p>-r Interactively repair the filesystem (ask for
confirmations). Note: It is generally a bad idea to use this
option if multiple fsck s are being run in parallel. Also
note that this is e2fscks default behavior; it supports this
option for backwards compatibility reasons only.</p>

<p>-y For some filesystem-specific checkers, the -y option
will cause the fs-specific fsck to always attempt to fix any
detected filesystem corruption automatically. Sometimes an
expert may be able to do better driving the fsck manually.
Note that not all filesystem-specific checkers implement
this option. In particu- lar fsck.minix(8) and
fsck.cramfs(8) does not support the -y option as of this
writing.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The fsck programs behavior is
affected by the following environment variables:</p>

<p>FSCK_FORCE_ALL_PARALLEL If this environment variable is
set, fsck will attempt to run all of the specified
filesystems in parallel, regardless of whether the
filesystems appear to be on the same device. (This is useful
for RAID systems or high-end storage systems such as those
sold by companies such as IBM or EMC.) Note that the
fs_passno value is still used.</p>

<p>FSCK_MAX_INST This environment variable will limit the
maximum number of file system checkers that can be running
at one time. This allows configurations which have a large
number of disks to avoid fsck starting too many file system
checkers at once, which might overload CPU and memory
resources available on the system. If this value is zero,
then an unlimited number of processes can be spawned. This
is currently the default, but future versions of fsck may
attempt to automatically determine how many file system
checks can be run based on gathering accounting data from
the operating system.</p>

<p>PATH The PATH environment variable is used to find file
system check- ers. A set of system directories are searched
first: /sbin, /sbin/fs.d, /sbin/fs, /etc/fs, and /etc. Then
the set of direc- tories found in the PATH environment are
searched.</p>

<p>FSTAB_FILE This environment variable allows the system
administrator to override the standard location of the
/etc/fstab file. It is also useful for developers who are
testing fsck.</p>
