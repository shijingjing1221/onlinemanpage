<p>NAME dropdb - remove a PostgreSQL database</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS dropdb [ option... ] dbname</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION dropdb destroys an existing PostgreSQL
database. The user who executes this command must be a
database superuser or the owner of the database.</p>

<p>dropdb is a wrapper around the SQL command DROP DATABASE
[drop_database(7)]. There is no effective difference between
dropping databases via this utility and via other methods
for accessing the server.</p>

<p>OPTIONS dropdb accepts the following command-line
arguments:</p>

<p>dbname Specifies the name of the database to be
removed.</p>

<p>-e</p>

<p>--echo Echo the commands that dropdb generates and sends
to the server.</p>

<p>-i</p>

<p>--interactive Issues a verification prompt before doing
anything destructive.</p>

<p>dropdb also accepts the following command-line arguments
for connection parameters:</p>

<p>-h host</p>

<p>--host host Specifies the host name of the machine on
which the server is running. If the value begins with a
slash, it is used as the directory for the Unix domain
socket.</p>

<p>-p port</p>

<p>--port port Specifies the TCP port or local Unix domain
socket file exten- sion on which the server is listening for
connections.</p>

<p>-U username</p>

<p>--username username User name to connect as.</p>

<p>-w</p>

<p>--no-password Never issue a password prompt. If the
server requires password authentication and a password is
not available by other means such as a .pgpass file, the
connection attempt will fail. This option can be useful in
batch jobs and scripts where no user is present to enter a
password.</p>

<p>-W</p>

<p>--password Force dropdb to prompt for a password before
connecting to a database.</p>

<p>This option is never essential, since dropdb will
automatically prompt for a password if the server demands
password authentica- tion. However, dropdb will waste a
connection attempt finding out that the server wants a
password. In some cases it is worth typing -W to avoid the
extra connection attempt.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT PGHOST</p>

<p>PGPORT</p>

<p>PGUSER Default connection parameters</p>

<p>This utility, like most other PostgreSQL utilities, also
uses the envi- ronment variables supported by libpq (see in
the documentation).</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS In case of difficulty, see DROP DATABASE
[drop_database(7)] and psql(1) for discussions of potential
problems and error messages. The database server must be
running at the targeted host. Also, any default connec- tion
settings and environment variables used by the libpq
front-end library will apply.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES To destroy the database demo on the default
database server:</p>

<p>$ dropdb demo</p>

<p>To destroy the database demo using the server on host
eden, port 5000, with verification and a peek at the
underlying command:</p>

<p>$ dropdb -p 5000 -h eden -i -e demo Database
&quot;demo&quot; will be permanently deleted. Are you sure?
(y/n) y DROP DATABASE demo;</p>
