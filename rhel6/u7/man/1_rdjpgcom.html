<p>NAME rdjpgcom - display text comments from a JPEG
file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rdjpgcom [ -raw ] [ -verbose ] [ filename ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION rdjpgcom reads the named JPEG/JFIF file, or
the standard input if no file is named, and prints any text
comments found in the file on the standard output.</p>

<p>The JPEG standard allows &quot;comment&quot; (COM)
blocks to occur within a JPEG file. Although the standard
doesnt actually define what COM blocks are for, they are
widely used to hold user-supplied text strings. This lets
you add annotations, titles, index terms, etc to your JPEG
files, and later retrieve them as text. COM blocks do not
interfere with the image stored in the JPEG file. The
maximum size of a COM block is 64K, but you can have as many
of them as you like in one JPEG file.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -raw Normally rdjpgcom escapes non-printable
characters in comments, for security reasons. This option
avoids that.</p>

<p>-verbose Causes rdjpgcom to also display the JPEG image
dimensions.</p>

<p>Switch names may be abbreviated, and are not case
sensitive.</p>

<p>HINTS rdjpgcom does not depend on the IJG JPEG library.
Its source code is intended as an illustration of the
minimum amount of code required to parse a JPEG file header
correctly.</p>

<p>In -verbose mode, rdjpgcom will also attempt to print
the contents of any &quot;APP12&quot; markers as text. Some
digital cameras produce APP12 mark- ers containing useful
textual information. If you like, you can modify the source
code to print other APPn marker types as well.</p>
