<p>NAME mbrlen - determine number of bytes in next
multibyte character</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;wchar.h&gt;</p>

<p>size_t mbrlen(const char *s, size_t n, mbstate_t
*ps);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The mbrlen() function inspects at most n
bytes of the multibyte string starting at s and extracts the
next complete multibyte character. It updates the shift
state *ps. If the multibyte character is not the null wide
character, it returns the number of bytes that were consumed
from s. If the multibyte character is the null wide
character, it resets the shift state *ps to the initial
state and returns 0.</p>

<p>If the n bytes starting at s do not contain a complete
multibyte char- acter, mbrlen() returns (size_t) -2. This
can happen even if n &gt;= MB_CUR_MAX, if the multibyte
string contains redundant shift sequences.</p>

<p>If the multibyte string starting at s contains an
invalid multibyte sequence before the next complete
character, mbrlen() returns (size_t) -1 and sets errno to
EILSEQ. In this case, the effects on *ps are undefined.</p>

<p>If ps is a NULL pointer, a static anonymous state only
known to the mbrlen() function is used instead.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The mbrlen() function returns the number of
bytes parsed from the multibyte sequence starting at s, if a
non-null wide character was rec- ognized. It returns 0, if a
null wide character was recognized. It returns (size_t) -1
and sets errno to EILSEQ, if an invalid multibyte sequence
was encountered. It returns (size_t) -2 if it couldnt parse
a complete multibyte character, meaning that n should be
increased.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO C99.</p>

<p>NOTES The behavior of mbrlen() depends on the LC_CTYPE
category of the cur- rent locale.</p>
