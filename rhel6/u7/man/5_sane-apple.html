<p>sane-apple(5) SANE Scanner Access Now Easy
sane-apple(5)</p>

<p>NAME sane-apple - SANE backend for Apple flatbed
scanners</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sane-apple library implements a SANE
(Scanner Access Now Easy) backend that provides access to
Apple flatbed scanners. At present, the following scanners
are supported from this backend:</p>

<p>--------------- ----- ------------------ ------
AppleScanner 4bit 16 Shades of Gray OneScanner 8bit 256
Shades of Gray ColorOneScanner 24bit RGB color 3-pass</p>

<p>If you own a Apple scanner other than the ones listed
above that works with this backend, please let us know by
sending the scanners model name, SCSI id, and firmware
revision to sane-devel@lists.alioth.debian.org. See
http://www.sane-project.org/mailing-lists.html for details
on how to subscribe to sane-devel.</p>

<p>DEVICE NAMES This backend expects device names of the
form:</p>

<p>special</p>

<p>Where special is either the path-name for the special
device that cor- responds to a SCSI scanner. For SCSI
scanners, the special device name must be a generic SCSI
device or a symlink to such a device. Under Linux, such a
device name could be /dev/sga or /dev/sge, for example. See
sane-scsi(5) for details.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION The apple.conf file is a list of options
and device names that corre- spond to Apple scanners. Empty
lines and lines starting with a hash mark (#) are ignored.
See sane-scsi(5) on details of what constitutes a valid
device name.</p>

<p>Options come in two flavors: global and positional ones.
Global options apply to all devices managed by the backend,
whereas positional options apply just to the most recently
mentioned device. Note that this means that the order in
which the options appear matters!</p>

<p>SCSI ADAPTER TIPS SCSI scanners are typically delivered
with an ISA SCSI adapter. Unfor- tunately, that adapter is
not worth much since it is not interrupt driven. It is
sometimes possible to get the supplied card to work, but
without an interrupt line, scanning will put so much load on
the system that it becomes almost unusable for other
tasks.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/sane.d/apple.conf The backend configuration
file (see also description of SANE_CONFIG_DIR below).</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-apple.a The static library
implementing this backend.</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-apple.so The shared library
implementing this backend (present on systems that support
dynamic loading).</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT SANE_CONFIG_DIR This environment variable is
list of directories where SANE looks for the configuration
file. Under UNIX directory names are separated by a colon
(:), under OS/2 by a semi-colon (;). If SANE_CONFIG_DIR is
not set, SANE defaults to search- ing the current working
directory (&quot;.&quot;) and then /etc/sane.d. If the value
of $SANE_CONFIG_DIR ends with the separator charac- ter, the
default directories are searched after the directory list.
For example, setting SANE_CONFIG_DIR to
&quot;/tmp/config:&quot; would result in directories
&quot;tmp/config&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and
&quot;/etc/sane.d&quot; being searched (in that order).</p>

<p>SANE_DEBUG_APPLE Controls the debug level. A value of
255 prints all debug out- put. Smaller values reduce
verbosity. Requires a library com- piled with debug
support.</p>

<p>CURRENT STATUS The apple backend is now in version 0.3
(Tue Jul 21 1998). Since I only have the AppleScanner and
not the other models (OneScanner, ColorOneS- canner) I can
only develop/test for the AppleScanner effectively. How-
ever with this release I almost completed the gui part of
all scanners. Most of the functionality is there. At least
OneScanner should scan at the AppleScanners compatible modes
(LineArt, HalfTone, Gray16). My personal belief is that with
a slight touch of debugging the OneScanner could be actually
usable. The ColorOneScanner needs more work. AppleS- canner
is of course almost fully supported.</p>

<p>MISSING FUNCTIONALITY Currently all three models lack
upload/download support.</p>

<p>AppleScanner Cannot up/download a halftone pattern.</p>

<p>OneScanner Cannot up/download halftone patterns or
calibration vectors.</p>

<p>ColorOneScanner Cannot up/download halftone patterns,
calibration vectors, cus- tom Color Correction Tables (CCT)
and of course custom gamma tables.</p>

<p>Park/UnPark (OneScanner, ColorOneScanner)</p>

<p>The above functionalities are missing because I dont
have the hardware to experiment on. Another reason is my
lack of understanding as to how or if the SANE API provide
means to describe any array type besides gamma.</p>

<p>UNSUPPORTED FEATURES The following &quot;features&quot;
will never be supported, at least while I maintain the
sane-apple backend.</p>

<p>NoHome (AppleScanner) The scanner lamp stays on and the
carriage assembly remains where it stops at the end of the
scan. After two minutes, if the scanner does not receive
another SCAN command, the lamp goes off and the carriage
returns to the home position.</p>

<p>Compression (AppleScanner) The Scanner can compress data
with CCITT Group III one dimen- sional algorithm (fax) and
the Skip White Line algorithm.</p>

<p>Multiple Windows (AppleScanner) AppleScanner may support
multiple windows. It would be a cool feature and a challenge
for me to code if it could intermix dif- ferent options for
different windows (scan areas). This way it could scan a
document in LineArt mode but the figures in it in Gray and
at a different resolution. Unfortunately this is
impossible.</p>

<p>Scan Direction (OneScanner) It controls the scan
direction. (?)</p>

<p>Status/Reset Button (OneScanner) This option controls
the status of the button on the OneScanner model. You can
also reset the button status by software.</p>

<p>BUGS SANE backend bugs are divided in two classes. We
have GUI bugs and scanner specific bugs.</p>

<p>We know we have a GUI bug when a parameter is not
showing up when it should (active) or vice versa. Finding
out which parameters are active across various Apple modes
and models from the documentation
ftp://ftpdev.info.apple.com/devworld/Technical_Documentation/Peripher-
als_Documentation/ is an interesting exercise. I may have
missed some dependencies. For example of the threshold
parameter the Apple Scanners Programming Guide says nothing.
I had to assume it is valid only in LineArt mode.</p>

<p>Scanner specific bugs are mostly due to mandatory
round-offs in order to scan. In the documentation in one
place states that the width of the scan area should be a
byte multiple. In another place it says that the width of
the scan area should be an even byte multiple. Go
figure...</p>

<p>Other sources of bugs are due to scsi communication,
scsi connects and disconnects. However the classical bugs
are still there. So you may encounter buffer overruns, null
pointers, memory corruption and SANE API violations.</p>

<p>SIGSEGV on SliceBars When you try to modify the scan
area from the slice bar you have a nice little cute core
dump. I dont know why. If you select the scan area from the
preview window or by hand typing the num- bers everything is
fine. The SIGSEGV happens deep in gtk library (gdk). I
really cannot debug it.</p>

<p>Options too much It is possible, especially for the
ColorOneScanner, for the backend s options panel to extend
beyond your screen. It happens with mine and I am running my
X Server at 1024x768. What can I say? Try smaller fonts in
the X server, or virtual screens.</p>

<p>Weird SCSI behaviour I am quoting David Myers
Here...</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; OS: FreeBSD 2.2.6 &gt;&gt; CC: egcs-1.02 Just
wanted to follow up on this... I recently changed my SCSI
card from the Adaptec 2940UW to a dual-channel Symbios 786
chipset. When I started up SANE with your driver, I managed
to scan line art drawings okay, but Gray16 scans led to a
stream of SCSI error messages on the console, ultimately
hanging with a message saying the scanner wasn t releasing
the SCSI bus. This may be that the Symbios is simply less
tolerant of ancient hard- ware, or may be bugs in your
driver or in SANE itself...</p>

<p>DEBUG If you encounter a GUI bug please set the
environmental variable SANE_DEBUG_APPLE to 255 and rerun the
exact sequence of keystrokes and menu selections to
reproduce it. Then send me a report with the log
attached.</p>

<p>If you have an Apple Macintosh with the AppleScanners
driver installed, reporting to me which options are grayed
out (inactive) in what modes would be very helpful.</p>

<p>If you want to offer some help but you don t have a
scanner, or you don t have the model you would like to help
with, or you are a SANE developer and you just want to take
a look at how the apple backend looks like, goto to apple.h
and #define the NEUTRALIZE_BACKEND macro. You can select the
scanner model through the APPLE_MODEL_SELECT macro.
Available options are APPLESCANNER, ONESCANNER,
COLORONESCANNER.</p>

<p>If you encounter a SCSI bus error or trimmed and/or
displaced images please set the environment variable
SANE_DEBUG_SANEI_SCSI to 255 before sending me the
report.</p>

<p>TODO Non Blocking Support Make sane-apple a non blocking
backend. Properly support sane_set_io_mode and
sane_get_select_fd</p>

<p>Scan Make scanning possible for all models in all
supported modes.</p>

<p>AUTHOR The sane-apple backend was written not entirely
from scratch by Milon Firikis. It is mostly based on the
mustek backend from David Mosberger and Andreas
Czechanowski</p>
