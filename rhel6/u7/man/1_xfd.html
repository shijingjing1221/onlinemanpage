<p>NAME xfd - display all the characters in an X font</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS xfd [-options ...] -fn fontname</p>

<p>xfd [-options ...] -fa fontname</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The xfd utility creates a window containing
the name of the font being displayed, a row of command
buttons, several lines of text for display- ing character
metrics, and a grid containing one glyph per cell. The
characters are shown in increasing order from left to right,
top to bottom. The first character displayed at the top left
will be charac- ter number 0 unless the -start option has
been supplied in which case the character with the number
given in the -start option will be used.</p>

<p>The characters are displayed in a grid of boxes, each
large enough to hold any single character in the font. Each
character glyph is drawn using the PolyText16 request (used
by the Xlib routine XDrawString16) or the XftDrawString32
routine, depending on whether the -fn or -fa option was
given. If the -box option is given, a rectangle will be
drawn around each character, showing where an ImageText16
request (used by the Xlib routine XDrawImageString16) would
cause background color to be displayed.</p>

<p>The origin of each glyph is normally set so that the
character is drawn in the upper left hand corner of the grid
cell. However, if a glyph has a negative left bearing or an
unusually large ascent, descent, or right bearing (as is the
case with cursor font), some character may not appear in
their own grid cells. The -center option may be used to
force all glyphs to be centered in their respective
cells.</p>

<p>All the characters in the font may not fit in the window
at once. To see the next page of glyphs, press the Next
button at the top of the window. To see the previous page,
press Prev. To exit xfd, press Quit.</p>

<p>Individual character metrics (index, width, bearings,
ascent and descent) can be displayed at the top of the
window by clicking on the desired character.</p>

<p>The font name displayed at the top of the window is the
full name of the font, as determined by the server. See
xlsfonts and fc-list for ways to generate lists of fonts, as
well as more detailed summaries of their metrics and
properties.</p>

<p>OPTIONS xfd accepts all of the standard toolkit command
line options along with the additional options listed
below:</p>

<p>-fn font This option specifies the core X server side
font to be dis- played. This can also be set with the
FontGrid font resource. A font must be specified.</p>

<p>-fa font This option specifies a Xft font to be
displayed. This can also be set with the FontGrid face
resource. A font pattern must be specified.</p>

<p>-box This option indicates that a box should be
displayed outlining the area that would be filled with
background color by an ImageText request. This can also be
set with the FontGrid box- Chars resource. The default is
False.</p>

<p>-center This option indicates that each glyph should be
centered in its grid. This can also be set with the FontGrid
centerChars resource. The default is False.</p>

<p>-start number This option specifies the glyph index of
the upper left hand corner of the grid. This is used to view
characters at arbi- trary locations in the font. This can
also be set with the FontGrid startChar resource. The
default is 0.</p>

<p>-bc color This option specifies the color to be used if
ImageText boxes are drawn. This can also be set with the
FontGrid boxColor resource.</p>

<p>-rows numrows This option specifies the number of rows
in the grid. This can also be set with the FontGrid cellRows
resource.</p>

<p>-columns numcols This option specifies the number of
columns in the grid. This can also be set with the FontGrid
cellColumns resource.</p>

<p>WIDGETS In order to specify resources, it is useful to
know the widgets which compose xfd. In the notation below,
indentation indicates hierarchical structure. The widget
class name is given first, followed by the wid- get instance
name. The application class name is Xfd.</p>

<p>FONTGRID RESOURCES The FontGrid widget is an
application-specific widget, and a subclass of the Simple
widget in the Athena widget set. The effects and instance
names of this widgets resources are given in the OPTIONS
sec- tion. Capitalize the first letter of the resource
instance name to get the corresponding class name.</p>

<p>APPLICATION SPECIFIC RESOURCES The instance names of the
application specific resources are given below. Capitalize
the first letter of the resource instance name to get the
corresponding class name. These resources are unlikely to be
interesting unless you are localizing xfd for a different
language.</p>

<p>selectFormat Specifies a printf-style format string used
to display informa- tion about the selected character. The
default is &quot;character 0x%02x%02x (%u,%u)
(%#o,%#o)&quot;. The arguments that will come after the
format string are char.byte1, char.byte2, char.byte1,
char.byte2, char.byte1, char.byte2. char.byte1 is byte 1 of
the selected character. char.byte2 is byte 2 of the selected
character.</p>

<p>metricsFormat Specifies a printf-style format string
used to display charac- ter metrics. The default is
&quot;width %d; left %d, right %d; ascent %d, descent %d
(font %d, %d)&quot;. The arguments that will come after the
format string are the character metrics width, lbearing,
rbearing, character ascent, character descent, font ascent,
and font descent.</p>

<p>rangeFormat Specifies a printf-style format string used
to display the range of characters currently being
displayed. The default is &quot;range: 0x%02x%02x (%u,%u)
thru 0x%02x%02x (%u,%u)&quot;. The argu- ments that will
come after the format string are the following fields from
the XFontStruct that is returned from opening the font:
min_byte1, min_char_or_byte2, min_byte1, min_char_or_byte2,
max_byte1, max_char_or_byte2, max_byte1,
max_char_or_byte2.</p>

<p>startFormat Specifies a printf-style format string used
to display informa- tion about the character at the upper
left corner of the font grid. The default is &quot;upper
left: 0x%04x (%d,%d)&quot;. The argu- ments that will come
after the format string are the new char- acter, the high
byte of the new character, and the low byte of the new
character.</p>

<p>nocharFormat Specifies a printf-style format string to
display when the selected character does not exist. The
default is &quot;no such character 0x%02x%02x (%u,%u)
(%#o,%#o)&quot;. The arguments that will come after the
format string are the same as for the selectFormat
resource.</p>

<p>BUGS The program should skip over pages full of
non-existent characters.</p>
