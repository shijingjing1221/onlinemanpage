<p>MTRR_ADD(9) Hardware Interfaces MTRR_ADD(9)</p>

<p>NAME mtrr_add - Add a memory type region</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS int mtrr_add(unsigned long base, unsigned long
size, unsigned int type, bool increment);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS base Physical base address of region</p>

<p>size Physical size of region</p>

<p>type Type of MTRR desired</p>

<p>increment If this is true do usage counting on the
region</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Memory type region registers control the
caching on newer Intel and non Intel processors. This
function allows drivers to request an MTRR is added. The
details and hardware specifics of each processor&acute;s
implementation are hidden from the caller, but nevertheless
the caller should expect to need to provide a power of two
size on an equivalent power of two boundary.</p>

<p>If the region cannot be added either because all regions
are in use or the CPU cannot support it a negative value is
returned. On success the register number for this entry is
returned, but should be treated as a cookie only.</p>

<p>On a multiprocessor machine the changes are made to all
processors. This is required on x86 by the Intel
processors.</p>

<p>The available types are</p>

<p>MTRR_TYPE_UNCACHABLE - No caching</p>

<p>MTRR_TYPE_WRBACK - Write data back in bursts
whenever</p>

<p>MTRR_TYPE_WRCOMB - Write data back soon but allow
bursts</p>

<p>MTRR_TYPE_WRTHROUGH - Cache reads but not writes</p>

<p>BUGS Needs a quiet flag for the cases where drivers do
not mind failures and do not wish system log messages to be
sent.</p>
