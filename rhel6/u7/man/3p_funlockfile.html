<p>FLOCKFILE(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
FLOCKFILE(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME flockfile, ftrylockfile, funlockfile - stdio
locking functions</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</p>

<p>void flockfile(FILE *file); int ftrylockfile(FILE
*file); void funlockfile(FILE *file);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION These functions shall provide for explicit
application-level locking of stdio ( FILE *) objects. These
functions can be used by a thread to delineate a sequence of
I/O statements that are executed as a unit.</p>

<p>The flockfile() function shall acquire for a thread
ownership of a ( FILE *) object.</p>

<p>The ftrylockfile() function shall acquire for a thread
ownership of a ( FILE *) object if the object is available;
ftrylockfile() is a non- blocking version of
flockfile().</p>

<p>The funlockfile() function shall relinquish the
ownership granted to the thread. The behavior is undefined
if a thread other than the cur- rent owner calls the
funlockfile() function.</p>

<p>The functions shall behave as if there is a lock count
associated with each ( FILE *) object. This count is
implicitly initialized to zero when the ( FILE *) object is
created. The ( FILE *) object is unlocked when the count is
zero. When the count is positive, a single thread owns the (
FILE *) object. When the flockfile() function is called, if
the count is zero or if the count is positive and the caller
owns the ( FILE *) object, the count shall be incremented.
Otherwise, the calling thread shall be suspended, waiting
for the count to return to zero. Each call to funlockfile()
shall decrement the count. This allows matching calls to
flockfile() (or successful calls to ftrylockfile()) and
funlockfile() to be nested.</p>

<p>All functions that reference ( FILE *) objects shall
behave as if they use flockfile() and funlockfile()
internally to obtain ownership of these ( FILE *)
objects.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE None for flockfile() and funlockfile().</p>

<p>The ftrylockfile() function shall return zero for
success and non-zero to indicate that the lock cannot be
acquired.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE Applications using these functions may
be subject to priority inver- sion, as discussed in the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 3.285,
Priority Inversion.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The flockfile() and funlockfile() functions
provide an orthogonal mutual-exclusion lock for each FILE.
The ftrylockfile() function pro- vides a non-blocking
attempt to acquire a file lock, analogous to
pthread_mutex_trylock().</p>

<p>These locks behave as if they are the same as those used
internally by stdio for thread-safety. This both provides
thread-safety of these functions without requiring a second
level of internal locking and allows functions in stdio to
be implemented in terms of other stdio functions.</p>

<p>Application writers and implementors should be aware
that there are potential deadlock problems on FILE objects.
For example, the line- buffered flushing semantics of stdio
(requested via {_IOLBF}) require that certain input
operations sometimes cause the buffered contents of
implementation-defined line-buffered output streams to be
flushed. If two threads each hold the lock on the others
FILE, deadlock ensues. This type of deadlock can be avoided
by acquiring FILE locks in a con- sistent order. In
particular, the line-buffered output stream deadlock can
typically be avoided by acquiring locks on input streams
before locks on output streams if a thread would be
acquiring both.</p>

<p>In summary, threads sharing stdio streams with other
threads can use flockfile() and funlockfile() to cause
sequences of I/O performed by a single thread to be kept
bundled. The only case where the use of flockfile() and
funlockfile() is required is to provide a scope pro- tecting
uses of the *_unlocked() functions/macros. This moves the
cost/performance tradeoff to the optimal point.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
