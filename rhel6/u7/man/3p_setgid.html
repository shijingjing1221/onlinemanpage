<p>SETGID(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual SETGID(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME setgid - set-group-ID</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>int setgid(gid_t gid);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION If the process has appropriate privileges,
setgid() shall set the real group ID, effective group ID,
and the saved set-group-ID of the calling process to
gid.</p>

<p>If the process does not have appropriate privileges, but
gid is equal to the real group ID or the saved set-group-ID,
setgid() shall set the effective group ID to gid; the real
group ID and saved set-group-ID shall remain unchanged.</p>

<p>The setgid() function shall not affect the supplementary
group list in any way.</p>

<p>Any supplementary group IDs of the calling process shall
remain unchanged.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, 0 is returned.
Otherwise, -1 shall be returned and errno set to indicate
the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The setgid() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The value of the gid argument is invalid and is
not supported by the implementation.</p>

<p>EPERM The process does not have appropriate privileges
and gid does not match the real group ID or the saved
set-group-ID.</p>
