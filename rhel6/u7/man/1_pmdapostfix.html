<p>NAME pmdapostfix - Postfix performance metrics domain
agent (PMDA)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pmdapostfix is a Performance Metrics Domain
Agent (PMDA) which exports mail queue sizes as reported by
qshape(1), as well as aggregate statis- tics collected from
mail.log.</p>

<p>INSTALLATION If you want access to the names and values
for the Postfix performance metrics, do the following as
root:</p>

<p># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/postfix # ./Install</p>

<p>To uninstall, do the following as root:</p>

<p># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/postfix # ./Remove</p>

<p>pmdapostfix is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be
executed directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify
pmcd(1) when the agent is installed or removed.</p>

<p>FILES $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/postfix/Install installation script
for the pmdapostfix agent</p>

<p>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/postfix/Remove undo installation script
for the pmdapostfix agent</p>

<p>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/postfix.log default log file for error
messages from pmdapostfix</p>

<p>PCP ENVIRONMENT Environment variables with the prefix
PCP_ are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP. On each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in pcp.conf(5).</p>

<p>SEE ALSO pmcd(1) and qshape(1).</p>
