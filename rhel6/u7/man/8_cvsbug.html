<p>NAME cvsbug - send problem report (PR) about CVS to a
central support site</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS cvsbug [ site ] [ -f problem-report ] [ -t
mail-address ] [ -P ] [ -L ] [ --request-id ] [ -v ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION cvsbug is a tool used to submit problem
reports (PRs) to a central sup- port site. In most cases the
correct site will be the default. This argument indicates
the support site which is responsible for the cate- gory of
problem involved. Some sites may use a local address as a
default. site values are defined by using the
aliases(5).</p>

<p>cvsbug invokes an editor on a problem report template
(after trying to fill in some fields with reasonable default
values). When you exit the editor, cvsbug sends the
completed form to the Problem Report Manage- ment System
(GNATS) at a central support site. At the support site, the
PR is assigned a unique number and is stored in the GNATS
database according to its category and submitter-id. GNATS
automatically replies with an acknowledgement, citing the
category and the PR number.</p>

<p>To ensure that a PR is handled promptly, it should
contain your (unique) submitter-id and one of the available
categories to identify the problem area. (Use cvsbug -L to
see a list of categories.)</p>

<p>The cvsbug template at your site should already be
customized with your submitter-id (running install-sid
submitter-id to accomplish this is part of the installation
procedures for cvsbug). If this hasnt been done, see your
system administrator for your submitter-id, or request one
from your support site by invokingcvsbug --request-id. If
your site does not distinguish between different user sites,
or if you are not affiliated with the support site, use net
for this field.</p>

<p>The more precise your problem description and the more
complete your information, the faster your support team can
solve your problems.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -f problem-report specify a file
(problem-report) which already contains a com- plete problem
report. cvsbug sends the contents of the file without
invoking the editor. If the value for problem-report is ,
then cvsbug reads from standard input.</p>

<p>-t mail-address Change mail address at the support site
for problem reports. The default mail-address is the address
used for the default site. Use the site argument rather than
this option in nearly all cases.</p>

<p>-P print the form specified by the environment variable
PR_FORM on standard output. If PR_FORM is not set, print the
standard blank PR template. No mail is sent.</p>

<p>-L print the list of available categories. No mail is
sent.</p>

<p>--request-id sends mail to the default support site, or
site if specified, with a request for your submitter-id. If
you are not affiliated with site, use a submitter-id of
net.</p>

<p>-v Display the cvsbug version number.</p>

<p>Note: use cvsbug to submit problem reports rather than
mailing them directly. Using both the template and cvsbug
itself will help ensure all necessary information will reach
the support site.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT The environment variable EDITOR specifies
the editor to invoke on the template. default: vi</p>

<p>If the environment variable PR_FORM is set, then its
value is used as the file name of the template for your
problem-report editing session. You can use this to start
with a partially completed form (for example, a form with
the identification fields already completed).</p>

<p>HOW TO FILL OUT A PROBLEM REPORT Problem reports have to
be in a particular form so that a program can easily manage
them. Please remember the following guidelines:</p>

<p>&middot; describe only one problem with each problem
report.</p>

<p>&middot; For follow-up mail, use the same subject line
as the one in the automatic acknowledgement. It consists of
category, PR number and the original synopsis line. This
allows the support site to relate several mail messages to a
particular PR and to record them automat- ically.</p>

<p>&middot; Please try to be as accurate as possible in the
subject and/or syn- opsis line.</p>

<p>&middot; The subject and the synopsis line are not
confidential. This is because open-bugs lists are compiled
from them. Avoid confidential information there.</p>

<p>See the GNU Info file cvsbug.info or the document
Reporting Problems With cvsbug for detailed information on
reporting problems</p>

<p>HOW TO SUBMIT TEST CASES, CODE, ETC. Submit small code
samples with the PR. Contact the support site for
instructions on submitting larger test cases and problematic
source code.</p>

<p>FILES /tmp/p$$ copy of PR used in editing session
/tmp/pf$$ copy of empty PR form, for testing purposes
/tmp/pbad$$ file for rejected PRs</p>
