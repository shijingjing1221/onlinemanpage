<p>NAME hpsa - HP Smart Array SCSI driver</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS modprobe hpsa [ hpsa_allow_any=1 ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION hpsa is a SCSI driver for HP Smart Array
RAID controllers.</p>

<p>OPTIONS hpsa_allow_any=1 This option allows the driver
to attempt to operate on any HP Smart Array hardware RAID
controller even if it is not explicitly known to the driver.
This allows newer hardware to work with older drivers.
Typically this is used for example to allow installation of
OSes from media which predates the RAID controller though it
may also be used to enable hpsa to drive older controllers
that would normally be handled by the cciss driver. These
older boards have not been tested and are not supported with
hpsa and cciss should still be used for these.</p>

<p>SUPPORTED HARDWARE The hpsa driver supports the
following Smart Array boards:</p>

<p>Smart Array P700M Smart Array P212 Smart Array P410
Smart Array P410i Smart Array P411 Smart Array P812 Smart
Array P712m Smart Array P711m StorageWorks P1210m</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION DETAILS To configure HP Smart Array
controllers, use the HP Array Configuration Utiltiy (either
hpacuxe or hpacucli) or the Offline ROM-based Configu-
ration Utility (ORCA) run from the Smart Arrays option ROM
at boot time.</p>

<p>FILES DEVICE NODES Logical drives are accessed via the
SCSI disk driver (sd), tape drives via the SCSI tape driver
(st), and the RAID controller vi the SCSI generic driver
(sg), with device nodes named /dev/sd*, /dev/st*, and
/dev/sg*, respectively.</p>

<p>HPSA SPECIFIC HOST ATTRIBUTE FILES IN /sys
/sys/class/scsi_host/host*/rescan the host
&quot;rescan&quot; attribute is a write only attribute.
Writing to this attribute will cause the driver to scan for
new, changed, or removed devices (e.g. hot- plugged tape
drives, or newly configured or deleted logical drives, etc.)
and notify the SCSI midlayer of any changes detected.
Normally this is triggered automatically by HPs Array
Configuration Utility (either the GUI or command line
variety) so for logical drive changes, the user should not
nor- mally have to use this. It may be useful when hot
plugging devices like tape drives, or entire storage boxes
containing pre-configured logical drives.</p>

<p>/sys/class/scsi_host/host*/firmware_revision The
&quot;firmware_revision&quot; attribute contains the
firmware version of the Smart Array. For example:
root@host:/sys/class/scsi_host/host4# cat firmware_revision
7.14</p>

<p>HPSA SPECIFIC DISK ATTRIBUTE FILES IN /sys
/sys/class/scsi_disk/c:b:t:l/device/unique_id contains a 32
hex-digit unique ID for each logical drive For example:</p>

<p>root@host:/sys/class/scsi_disk/4:0:0:0/device# cat
unique_id 600508B1001044395355323037570F77</p>

<p>/sys/class/scsi_disk/c:b:t:l/device/raid_level contains
the RAID level of each logical drive. For example:
root@host:/sys/class/scsi_disk/4:0:0:0/device# cat
raid_level RAID 0</p>

<p>/sys/class/scsi_disk/c:b:t:l/device/lunid (where c:b:t:l
are the con- troller, bus, target and lun of the device)
contains 16 hex- digit (8 byte) LUN ID by which a logical
drive or physical device can be addressed. For example:
root@host:/sys/class/scsi_disk/4:0:0:0/device# cat lunid
0x0000004000000000</p>

<p>SUPPORTED IOCTLS For compatibility with applications
written for the cciss driver, many, but not all of the
ioctls supported by the cciss driver are also sup- ported by
the hpsa driver. The data structures used by these are
described in include/linux/cciss_ioctl.h</p>

<p>CCISS_DEREGDISK CCISS_REGNEWDISK CCISS_REGNEWD</p>

<p>The above three ioctls all do exactly the same thing,
which is to cause the driver to rescan for new devices. This
does exactly the same thing as writing to the hpsa specific
host &quot;rescan&quot; attribute.</p>

<p>CCISS_GETPCIINFO Returns PCI domain, bus, device and
function and &quot;board ID&quot; (PCI subsystem ID).</p>

<p>CCISS_GETDRIVVER Returns driver version in three bytes
encoded as: (major_version &lt;&lt; 16) | (minor_version
&lt;&lt; 8) | (subminor_ver- sion)</p>

<p>CCISS_PASSTHRU CCISS_BIG_PASSTHRU Allows
&quot;BMIC&quot; and &quot;CISS&quot; commands to be passed
through to the Smart Array. These are used exten- sively by
the HP Array Configuration Utility, SNMP storage agents,
etc. See cciss_vol_status at http://cciss.sf.net for some
examples.</p>
