<p>NAME XmVaCreateSimpleCheckBox A RowColumn widget
convenience creation function</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;Xm/RowColumn.h&gt; Widget
XmVaCreateSimpleCheckBox( Widget parent, String name,
XtCallbackProc callback);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION XmVaCreateSimpleCheckBox creates an instance
of a RowColumn widget of type XmWORK_AREA and returns the
associated widget ID. This routine uses the ANSI C
variable-length argument list (varargs) calling conven-
tion.</p>

<p>This routine creates a CheckBox and its
ToggleButtonGadget children. A CheckBox is similar to a
RadioBox, except that more than one button can be selected
at a time. The name of each button is button_n, where n is
an integer from 0 (zero) to the number of buttons in the
menu minus 1. Buttons are named and created in the order in
which they are specified in the variable portion of the
argument list.</p>

<p>parent Specifies the parent widget ID.</p>

<p>name Specifies the name of the created widget.</p>

<p>callback Specifies a callback procedure to be called
when a buttons value changes. This callback function is
added to each but- ton after creation as the button s
XmNvalueChangedCallback. The callback function is called
when a buttons value changes, and the button number is
returned in the client_data field.</p>

<p>The variable portion of the argument list consists of
groups of argu- ments. The first argument in each group is a
constant or a string and determines which arguments follow
in that group. The last argument in the list must be NULL.
The following list describes the possible first arguments in
each group of varargs:</p>

<p>XmVaCHECKBUTTON This is followed by four additional
arguments. The set speci- fies one button in the CheckBox
and some of its resource val- ues. The following list
describes the additional four argu- ments, in order.</p>

<p>label The label string, of type XmString</p>

<p>mnemonic The mnemonic, of type KeySym. This is ignored
in this release.</p>

<p>accelerator The accelerator, of type String. This is
ignored in this release.</p>

<p>accelerator_text The accelerator text, of type XmString.
This is ignored in this release.</p>

<p>resource_name This is followed by one additional
argument, the value of the resource, of type XtArgVal. The
pair specifies a resource and its value for the RowColumn
widget.</p>

<p>XtVaTypedArg This is followed by four additional
arguments. The set speci- fies a resource and its value for
the RowColumn widget. A resource type conversion is
performed if necessary. Following are the additional four
arguments, in order:</p>

<p>name The resource name, of type String</p>

<p>type The type of the resource value supplied, of type
String</p>

<p>value The resource value (or a pointer to the resource
value, depending on the type and size of the value), of type
XtArgVal</p>

<p>size The size of the resource value in bytes, of type
int</p>

<p>XtVaNestedList This is followed by one additional
argument of type XtVarArgsList. This argument is a nested
list of varargs returned by XtVaCreateArgsList.</p>

<p>For more information on variable-length argument lists,
see the X Toolkit Intrinsics documentation.</p>

<p>A number of resources exist specifically for use with
this and other simple menu creation routines. For a complete
definition of RowColumn and its associated resources, see
XmRowColumn(3).</p>

<p>RETURN Returns the RowColumn widget ID.</p>
