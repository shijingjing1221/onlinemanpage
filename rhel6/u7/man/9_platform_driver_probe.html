<p>PLATFORM_DRIVER_PROB(9) Device drivers infrastructure
PLATFORM_DRIVER_PROB(9)</p>

<p>NAME platform_driver_probe - register driver for
non-hotpluggable device</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS int __init_or_module
platform_driver_probe(struct platform_driver * drv, int
(*probe) (struct platform_device *));</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS drv platform driver structure</p>

<p>probe the driver probe routine, probably from an __init
section</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Use this instead of platform_driver_register
when you know the device is not hotpluggable and has already
been registered, and you want to remove its run-once probe
infrastructure from memory after the driver has bound to the
device.</p>

<p>One typical use for this would be with drivers for
controllers integrated into system-on-chip processors, where
the controller devices have been configured as part of board
setup.</p>

<p>Returns zero if the driver registered and bound to a
device, else returns a negative error code and with the
driver not registered.</p>
