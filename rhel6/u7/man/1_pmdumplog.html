<p>NAME pmdumplog - dump internal details of a performance
metrics archive log</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pmdumplog [-adiLlmrstxz] [-n pmnsfile] [-S
starttime] [-T endtime] [-Z timezone] archive [metricname
...] pmdumplog [-v file]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pmdumplog dumps assorted control, metadata,
index and state information from the files of a Performance
Co-Pilot (PCP) archive log. The archive log has the base
name archive and must have been previously created using
pmlogger(1).</p>

<p>Normally pmdumplog operates on the distributed
Performance Metrics Name Space (PMNS), however if the -n
option is specified an alternative local PMNS is loaded from
the file pmnsfile.</p>

<p>If any metricname arguments appear, the report will be
restricted to information relevant to the named performance
metrics. If metricname is a non-leaf node in the namespace
(see pmns(5)), then pmdumplog will recursively descend the
archives namespace and report on all leaf nodes.</p>

<p>The options control the specific information to be
reported.</p>

<p>-a Report everything, i.e. the flags -d, -i, -l, -m, -s
and -t.</p>

<p>-d Display the metadata and descriptions for those
performance met- rics that appear at least once in the
archive: see pmLookupDesc(3) for more details on the
metadata describing metrics.</p>

<p>-i Display the instance domains, and any variations in
their instance members over the duration of the archive: see
pmGetInDom(3) for more details on instance domains.</p>

<p>-l Dump the archive label, showing the log format
version, the time and date for the start and (current) end
of the archive, and the host from which the performance
metrics values were collected.</p>

<p>-L Like -l, just a little more verbose.</p>

<p>-m Print the values for the performance metrics from the
archive. This is the default display option.</p>

<p>Metrics without an instance domain are reported as:
[timestamp] metric-id (metric-name): value1 value2</p>

<p>Metrics with an instance domain are reported as:
[timestamp] metric-id (metric-name): inst [internal-id or
&quot;external-id&quot;] value1 value2</p>

<p>The timestamp is only reported for the first metric in a
group of metrics sharing the same timestamp.</p>

<p>-r Process the archive in reverse order, from most
recent to oldest recorded metric values.</p>

<p>-S When using the -m option, the report will be
restricted to those records logged at or after starttime.
Refer to PCPIntro(1) for a complete description of the
syntax for starttime.</p>

<p>-s Report the size in bytes of each physical record in
the archive.</p>

<p>-T When using the -m option, the report will be
restricted to those records logged before or at endtime.
Refer to PCPIntro(1) for a complete description of the
syntax for endtime.</p>

<p>-t Dump the temporal index that is used to provide
accelerated access to large archive files.</p>

<p>The integrity of the index will also be checked. If the
index is found to be corrupted, the *.index file can be
renamed or removed and the archive will still be accessible,
however retrievals may take longer without the index. Note
however that a corrupted temporal index is usually
indicative of a deeper malaise that may infect all files in
a PCP archive.</p>

<p>-v Verbose mode. Dump the records from a physical
archive file in hexadecimal format. In this case file is the
name of a single file, usually a basename (as would
otherwise appear as the archive command line argument),
concatenated with . followed by one of meta (the metadata),
index (the temporal index), or a digit (one of the volumes
of metric values).</p>

<p>Use of -v precludes the use of all other options and
arguments.</p>

<p>-x Extended timestamp reporting format that includes the
day of the week, day of the month, month and year in
addition to the (default) hours, minutes and seconds time.
This is useful for archives that span multiple days.</p>

<p>By default, pmdumplog reports the time of day according
to the local timezone on the system where pmdumplog is run.
The -Z option changes the timezone to timezone in the format
of the environment variable TZ as described in environ(5).
The -z option changes the timezone to the local timezone at
the host that is the source of the performance met- rics, as
specified in the label record of the archive log.</p>

<p>FILES $PCP_VAR_DIR/pmns/* default local PMNS
specification files $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmlogger/hostname Default
directory for PCP archives containing performance metric
values collected from the host hostname.</p>

<p>PCP ENVIRONMENT Environment variables with the prefix
PCP_ are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP. On each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in pcp.conf(5).</p>
