<p>SDL_SemTryWait(3) SDL API Reference
SDL_SemTryWait(3)</p>

<p>NAME SDL_SemTryWait - Attempt to lock a semaphore but
dont suspend the thread.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &quot;SDL.h&quot; #include
&quot;SDL_thread.h&quot;</p>

<p>int SDL_SemTryWait(SDL_sem *sem);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION SDL_SemTryWait is a non-blocking varient of
SDL_SemWait. If the value of the semaphore pointed to by sem
is positive it will atomically decrement the semaphore value
and return 0, otherwise it will return SDL_MUTEX_TIMEOUT
instead of suspending the thread.</p>

<p>After SDL_SemTryWait is successful, the semaphore can be
released and its count atomically incremented by a
successful call to SDL_SemPost.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Returns 0 if the semaphore was successfully
locked or either SDL_MUTEX_TIMEOUT or -1 if the thread would
have suspended or there was an error, respectivly.</p>

<p>If the semaphore was not successfully locked, the
semaphore will be unchanged.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES res = SDL_SemTryWait(my_sem);</p>

<p>if (res == SDL_MUTEX_TIMEOUT) { return TRY_AGAIN; } if
(res == -1) { return WAIT_ERROR; }</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>SDL_SemPost(my_sem);</p>
