<p>MKNOD(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual MKNOD(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME mknod - make a directory, a special file, or a
regular file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;</p>

<p>int mknod(const char *path, mode_t mode, dev_t dev);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The mknod() function shall create a new file
named by the pathname to which the argument path points.</p>

<p>The file type for path is ORed into the mode argument,
and the appli- cation shall select one of the following
symbolic constants:</p>

<p>Name Description S_IFIFO FIFO-special S_IFCHR
Character-special (non-portable) S_IFDIR Directory
(non-portable) S_IFBLK Block-special (non-portable) S_IFREG
Regular (non-portable)</p>

<p>The only portable use of mknod() is to create a
FIFO-special file. If mode is not S_IFIFO or dev is not 0,
the behavior of mknod() is unspec- ified.</p>

<p>The permissions for the new file are ORed into the mode
argument, and may be selected from any combination of the
following symbolic con- stants:</p>

<p>Name Description S_ISUID Set user ID on execution.
S_ISGID Set group ID on execution. S_IRWXU Read, write, or
execute (search) by owner. S_IRUSR Read by owner. S_IWUSR
Write by owner. S_IXUSR Execute (search) by owner. S_IRWXG
Read, write, or execute (search) by group. S_IRGRP Read by
group. S_IWGRP Write by group. S_IXGRP Execute (search) by
group. S_IRWXO Read, write, or execute (search) by others.
S_IROTH Read by others. S_IWOTH Write by others. S_IXOTH
Execute (search) by others. S_ISVTX On directories,
restricted deletion flag.</p>

<p>The user ID of the file shall be initialized to the
effective user ID of the process. The group ID of the file
shall be initialized to either the effective group ID of the
process or the group ID of the parent directory.
Implementations shall provide a way to initialize the files
group ID to the group ID of the parent directory.
Implementations may, but need not, provide an
implementation-defined way to initialize the file s group ID
to the effective group ID of the calling process. The owner,
group, and other permission bits of mode shall be modified
by the file mode creation mask of the process. The mknod()
function shall clear each bit whose corresponding bit in the
file mode creation mask of the process is set.</p>

<p>If path names a symbolic link, mknod() shall fail and
set errno to [EEXIST].</p>

<p>Upon successful completion, mknod() shall mark for
update the st_atime, st_ctime, and st_mtime fields of the
file. Also, the st_ctime and st_mtime fields of the
directory that contains the new entry shall be marked for
update.</p>

<p>Only a process with appropriate privileges may invoke
mknod() for file types other than FIFO-special.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, mknod() shall
return 0. Otherwise, it shall return -1, the new file shall
not be created, and errno shall be set to indicate the
error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The mknod() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EACCES A component of the path prefix denies search
permission, or write permission is denied on the parent
directory.</p>

<p>EEXIST The named file exists.</p>

<p>EINVAL An invalid argument exists.</p>

<p>EIO An I/O error occurred while accessing the file
system.</p>

<p>ELOOP A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during
resolution of the path argument.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG The length of a pathname exceeds {PATH_MAX}
or a pathname compo- nent is longer than {NAME_MAX}.</p>

<p>ENOENT A component of the path prefix specified by path
does not name an existing directory or path is an empty
string.</p>

<p>ENOSPC The directory that would contain the new file
cannot be extended or the file system is out of file
allocation resources.</p>

<p>ENOTDIR A component of the path prefix is not a
directory.</p>

<p>EPERM The invoking process does not have appropriate
privileges and the file type is not FIFO-special.</p>

<p>EROFS The directory in which the file is to be created
is located on a read-only file system.</p>

<p>The mknod() function may fail if:</p>

<p>ELOOP More than {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic links were
encountered during resolution of the path argument.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG Pathname resolution of a symbolic link
produced an intermediate result whose length exceeds
{PATH_MAX}.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Creating a FIFO Special File The following
example shows how to create a FIFO special file named
/home/cnd/mod_done, with read/write permissions for owner,
and with read permissions for group and others.</p>

<p>#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; #include
&lt;sys/stat.h&gt;</p>

<p>dev_t dev; int status; ... status =
mknod(&quot;/home/cnd/mod_done&quot;, S_IFIFO | S_IWUSR |
S_IRUSR | S_IRGRP | S_IROTH, dev);</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The mkfifo() function is preferred
over this function for making FIFO special files.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The POSIX.1-1990 standard required that the
group ID of a newly created file be set to the group ID of
its parent directory or to the effective group ID of the
creating process. FIPS 151-2 required that implementa- tions
provide a way to have the group ID be set to the group ID of
the containing directory, but did not prohibit
implementations also sup- porting a way to set the group ID
to the effective group ID of the cre- ating process.
Conforming applications should not assume which group ID
will be used. If it matters, an application can use chown()
to set the group ID after the file is created, or determine
under what conditions the implementation will set the
desired group ID.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
