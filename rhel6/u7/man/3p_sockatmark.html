<p>SOCKATMARK(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
SOCKATMARK(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME sockatmark - determine whether a socket is at the
out-of-band mark</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;</p>

<p>int sockatmark(int s);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sockatmark() function shall determine
whether the socket specified by the descriptor s is at the
out-of-band data mark (see the System Interfaces volume of
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 2.10.12, Socket Out- of-Band
State). If the protocol for the socket supports out-of-band
data by marking the stream with an out-of-band data mark,
the sockat- mark() function shall return 1 when all data
preceding the mark has been read and the out-of-band data
mark is the first element in the receive queue. The
sockatmark() function shall not remove the mark from the
stream.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, the
sockatmark() function shall return a value indicating
whether the socket is at an out-of-band data mark. If the
protocol has marked the data stream and all data preceding
the mark has been read, the return value shall be 1; if
there is no mark, or if data precedes the mark in the
receive queue, the sockatmark() function shall return 0.
Otherwise, it shall return a value of -1 and set errno to
indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The sockatmark() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EBADF The s argument is not a valid file descriptor.</p>

<p>ENOTTY The s argument does not specify a descriptor for
a socket.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The use of this function between
receive operations allows an applica- tion to determine
which received data precedes the out-of-band data and which
follows the out-of-band data.</p>

<p>There is an inherent race condition in the use of this
function. On an empty receive queue, the current read of the
location might well be at the &quot;mark&quot;, but the
system has no way of knowing that the next data segment that
will arrive from the network will carry the mark, and
sockatmark() will return false, and the next read operation
will silently consume the mark.</p>

<p>Hence, this function can only be used reliably when the
application already knows that the out-of-band data has been
seen by the system or that it is known that there is data
waiting to be read at the socket (via SIGURG or select()).
See Socket Receive Queue, Socket Out-of-Band Data State,
Signals, and pselect() for details.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The sockatmark() function replaces the
historical SIOCATMARK command to ioctl() which implemented
the same functionality on many implementa- tions. Using a
wrapper function follows the adopted conventions to avoid
specifying commands to the ioctl() function, other than
those now included to support XSI STREAMS. The sockatmark()
function could be implemented as follows:</p>

<p>#include &lt;sys/ioctl.h&gt;</p>

<p>int sockatmark(int s) { int val; if
(ioctl(s,SIOCATMARK,&amp;val)==-1) return(-1); return(val);
}</p>

<p>The use of [ENOTTY] to indicate an incorrect descriptor
type matches the historical behavior of SIOCATMARK.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
