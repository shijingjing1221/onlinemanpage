<p>GROTTY(1) GROTTY(1)</p>

<p>NAME grotty - groff driver for typewriter-like
devices</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS grotty [ -bBcdfhiouUv ] [ -Fdir ] [ files...
]</p>

<p>It is possible to have whitespace between the -F option
and its parame- ter.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION grotty translates the output of GNU troff
into a form suitable for typewriter-like devices. Normally
grotty should be invoked by using the groff command with a
-Tascii, -Tascii8, -Tlatin1, -Tnippon or -Tutf8 option on
ASCII based systems, and with -Tcp1047 and -Tutf8 on EBCDIC
based hosts. If no files are given, grotty will read the
stan- dard input. A filename of - will also cause grotty to
read the stan- dard input. Output is written to the standard
output.</p>

<p>By default, grotty emits SGR escape sequences (from ISO
6429, also called ANSI color escapes) to change text
attributes (bold, italic, colors). This makes it possible to
have eight different background and foreground colors;
additionally, bold and italic attributes can be used at the
same time (by using the BI font).</p>

<p>The following colors are defined in tty.tmac: black,
white, red, green, blue, yellow, magenta, cyan. Unknown
colors are mapped to the default color (which is dependent
on the settings of the terminal; in most cases, this is
black for the foreground and white for the background).</p>

<p>Use the -c switch to revert to the old behaviour,
printing a bold char- acter c with the sequence c BACKSPACE
c and an italic character c by the sequence _ BACKSPACE c .
At the same time, color output is dis- abled. The same
effect can be achieved by setting either the GROFF_NO_SGR
environment variable or using the sgr X command (see
below).</p>

<p>For SGR support, it is necessary to use the -R option of
less(1) to disable the interpretation of grotty s old output
format. Conse- quently, all programs which use less as the
pager program have to pass this option to it. For man(1) in
particular, either add -R to the $PAGER environment
variable, e.g.</p>

<p>PAGER=&quot;/usr/bin/less -R&quot; export PAGER</p>

<p>or use the -P option of man to set the pager executable
and its options, or modify the configuration file of man in
a similar fashion.</p>

<p>grottys old output format can be displayed on a terminal
by piping through ul(1). Pagers such as more(1) or less(1)
are also able to dis- play these sequences. Use either -B or
-U when piping into less(1); use -b when piping into
more(1). There is no need to filter the output through
col(1) since grotty never outputs reverse line feeds.</p>

<p>The font description file may contain a command</p>

<p>internalname n</p>

<p>where n is a decimal integer. If the 01 bit in n is set,
then the font will be treated as an italic font; if the 02
bit is set, then it will be treated as a bold font. The code
field in the font description field gives the code which
will be used to output the character. This code can also be
used in the escape sequence in troff.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -b Suppress the use of overstriking for bold
characters. Ignored if -c isnt used.</p>

<p>-B Use only overstriking for bold-italic characters.
Ignored if -c isnt used.</p>

<p>-c Use grottys old output format (see above). This also
disables color output.</p>

<p>-d Ignore all grotty will render l... commands that have
at least one zero argument (and so are either horizontal or
vertical) using -, |, and + characters.</p>

<p>-f Use form feeds in the output. A form feed will be
output at the end of each page that has no output on its
last line.</p>

<p>-Fdir Prepend directory dir/devname to the search path
for font and device description files; name is the name of
the device, usu- ally ascii, ascii8, latin1, utf8, nippon or
cp1047.</p>

<p>-h Use horizontal tabs in the output. Tabs are assumed
to be set every 8 columns.</p>

<p>-i Use escape sequences to set the italic text attribute
instead of the underline attribute for italic fonts (I and
BI ). Note that most terminals (including xterm) don t
support this. Ignored if -c is active.</p>

<p>-o Suppress overstriking (other than for bold or
underlined charac- ters in case the old output format has
been activated with -c).</p>

<p>-u Suppress the use of underlining for italic
characters. Ignored if -c isnt used.</p>

<p>-U Use only underlining for bold-italic characters.
Ignored if -c isnt used.</p>

<p>-v Print the version number.</p>

<p>USAGE grotty understands a single X command produced
using the sequence.</p>

<p>tty: sgr n If n is non-zero or missing, enable SGR
output (this is the default), otherwise use the old drawing
scheme for bold and underline.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT GROFF_NO_SGR If set, the old drawing scheme
for bold and underline (using the backspace character) is
active. Colors are disabled.</p>

device will be installed.</p>

<p>BUGS grotty is intended only for simple documents.</p>

<p>There is no support for fractional horizontal or
vertical motions.</p>

<p>There is no support for lines.</p>

<p>Characters above the first line (ie with a vertical
position of 0) can- not be printed.</p>

<p>Color handling is different compared to grops(1). M
doesnt set the fill color for closed graphic objects (which
grotty doesnt support anyway) but changes the background
color of the character cell, affect- ing all subsequent
operations.</p>
