<p>PERLCOMMUNITY(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERLCOMMUNITY(1)</p>

<p>NAME perlcommunity - a brief overview of the Perl
community</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This document aims to provide an overview of
the vast perl community, which is far too large and diverse
to provide a detailed listing. If any specific niche has
been forgotten, it is not meant as an insult but an omission
for the sake of brevity.</p>

<p>The Perl community is as diverse as Perl, and there is a
large amount of evidence that the Perl users apply TMTOWTDI
to all endeavors, not just programming. From websites, to
IRC, to mailing lists, there is more than one way to get
involved in the community.</p>

<p>Where to find the community There is a central directory
for the Perl community: &lt;http://perl.org&gt; maintained
by the Perl Foundation
(&lt;http://www.perlfoundation.org/&gt;), which tracks and
provides services for a variety of other community
sites.</p>

<p>Mailing lists and Newsgroups Perl runs on e-mail, there
is no doubt about it. The Camel book was originally written
mostly over e-mail and today Perl s development is
co-ordinated through mailing lists. The largest repository
of Perl mailing lists is located at
&lt;http://lists.perl.org&gt;.</p>

<p>Most Perl-related projects set up mailing lists for both
users and contributors. If you dont see a certain project
listed at &lt;http://lists.perl.org&gt;, check the
particular website for that project. Most mailing lists are
archived at &lt;http://nntp.perl.org/&gt;.</p>

<p>There are also plenty of Perl related newsgroups located
under &quot;comp.lang.perl.*&quot;.</p>

<p>IRC The Perl community has a rather large IRC presence.
For starters, it has its own IRC network,
&lt;irc://irc.perl.org&gt;. General (not help- oriented)
chat can be found at &lt;irc://irc.perl.org/#perl&gt;. Many
other more specific chats are also hosted on the network.
Information about irc.perl.org is located on the networks
website: &lt;http://www.irc.perl.org&gt;. For a more help
oriented #perl, check out
&lt;irc://irc.freenode.net/#perl&gt;. Perl 6 development
also has a presence in
&lt;irc://irc.freenode.net/#perl6&gt;. Most Perl-related
channels will be kind enough to point you in the right
direction if you ask nicely.</p>

<p>Any large IRC network (Dalnet, EFnet) is also likely to
have a #perl channel, with varying activity levels.</p>

<p>Websites Perl websites come in a variety of forms, but
they fit into two large categories: forums and news
websites. There are many Perl related websites, so only a
few of the communitys largest are mentioned here.</p>

<p>News sites</p>

<p>&lt;http://perl.com/&gt; Run by OReilly Media (The
publisher of the Camel Book among other Perl-related
literature), perl.com provides current Perl news, articles,
and resources for Perl developers as well as a directory of
other useful websites.</p>

<p>&lt;http://use.perl.org/&gt; use Perl; provides a
slashdot-style Perl news website covering all things Perl,
from minutes of the meetings of the Perl 6 Design team to
conference announcements with (ir)relevant discussion.</p>

<p>Forums</p>

<p>&lt;http://www.perlmonks.org/&gt; PerlMonks is one of
the largest Perl forums, and describes itself as &quot;A
place for individuals to polish, improve, and showcase their
Perl skills.&quot; and &quot;A community which allows
everyone to grow and learn from each other.&quot;</p>

<p>User Groups Many cities around the world have local Perl
Mongers chapters. A Perl Mongers chapter is a local user
group which typically holds regular in- person meetings,
both social and technical; helps organize local conferences,
workshops, and hackathons; and provides a mailing list or
other continual contact method for its members to keep in
touch.</p>

<p>To find your local Perl Mongers (or PM as theyre
commonly abbreviated) group check the international Perl
Mongers directory at &lt;http://www.pm.org/&gt;.</p>

<p>Workshops Perl workshops are, as the name might suggest,
workshops where Perl is taught in a variety of ways. At the
workshops, subjects range from a beginner s introduction
(such as the Pittsburgh Perl Workshops &quot;Zero To
Perl&quot;) to much more advanced subjects.</p>

<p>There are several great resources for locating
workshops: the websites mentioned above, the calendar
mentioned below, and the YAPC Europe website,
&lt;http://www.yapceurope.org/&gt;, which is probably the
best resource for European Perl events.</p>

<p>Hackathons Hackathons are a very different kind of
gathering where Perl hackers gather to do just that, hack
nonstop for an extended (several day) period on a specific
project or projects. Information about hackathons can be
located in the same place as information about workshops as
well as in &lt;irc://irc.perl.org/#perl&gt;.</p>

<p>If you have never been to a hackathon, here are a few
basic things you need to know before attending: have a
working laptop and know how to use it; check out the
involved projects before hand; have the necessary version
control client; and bring backup equipment (an extra LAN
cable, additional power strips, etc.) because someone will
forget.</p>

<p>Conventions Perl has two major annual conventions: The
Perl Conference (now part of OSCON), put on by OReilly, and
Yet Another Perl Conference or YAPC (pronounced yap-see),
which is localized into several regional YAPCs (North
America, Europe, Asia) in a stunning grassroots display by
the Perl community. For more information about either
conference, check out their respective web pages: OSCON
&lt;http://conferences.oreillynet.com/&gt;; YAPC
&lt;http://www.yapc.org&gt;.</p>

<p>A relatively new conference franchise with a large Perl
portion is the Open Source Developers Conference or OSDC.
First held in Australia it has recently also spread to
Israel. More information can be found at:
&lt;http://www.osdc.com.au/&gt; for Australia, and
&lt;http://www.osdc.org.il&gt; for Israel.</p>

<p>Calendar of Perl Events The Perl Review,
&lt;http://www.theperlreview.com&gt; maintains a website and
Google calendar
(&lt;http://www.theperlreview.com/community_calendar&gt;)
for tracking workshops, hackathons, Perl Mongers meetings,
and other events. Views of this calendar are at
&lt;http://www.perl.org/events.html&gt; and
&lt;http://www.yapc.org&gt;.</p>

<p>Not every event or Perl Mongers group is on that
calendar, so dont lose heart if you don t see yours posted.
To have your event or group listed, contact brian d foy
(brian@theperlreview.com).</p>
