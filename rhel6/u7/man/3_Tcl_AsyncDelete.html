Tcl_AsyncCreate(3)</p>


<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME Tcl_AsyncCreate, Tcl_AsyncMark, Tcl_AsyncInvoke,
Tcl_AsyncDelete, Tcl_AsyncReady - handle asynchronous
events</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tcl.h&gt;</p>

<p>Tcl_AsyncHandler Tcl_AsyncCreate(proc, clientData)</p>

<p>Tcl_AsyncMark(async)</p>

<p>int Tcl_AsyncInvoke(interp, code)</p>

<p>Tcl_AsyncDelete(async)</p>

<p>int Tcl_AsyncReady()</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS Tcl_AsyncProc *proc (in) Procedure to invoke
to handle an asynchronous event.</p>

<p>ClientData clientData (in) One-word value to pass to
proc.</p>

<p>Tcl_AsyncHandler async (in) Token for asynchronous event
handler.</p>

<p>Tcl_Interp *interp (in) Tcl interpreter in which com-
mand was being evaluated when handler was invoked, or NULL
if handler was invoked when there was no interpreter
active.</p>

<p>int code (in) Completion code from command that just
completed in interp, or 0 if interp is NULL.

<p>DESCRIPTION These procedures provide a safe mechanism
for dealing with asynchronous events such as signals. If an
event such as a signal occurs while a Tcl script is being
evaluated then it is not safe to take any substan- tive
action to process the event. For example, it is not safe to
eval- uate a Tcl script since the interpreter may already be
in the middle of evaluating a script; it may not even be
safe to allocate memory, since a memory allocation could
have been in progress when the event occurred. The only safe
approach is to set a flag indicating that the event
occurred, then handle the event later when the world has
returned to a clean state, such as after the current Tcl
command completes.</p>

<p>Tcl_AsyncCreate, Tcl_AsyncDelete, and Tcl_AsyncReady are
thread sensi- tive. They access and/or set a thread-specific
data structure in the event of a core built with
--enable-threads. The token created by Tcl_AsyncCreate
contains the needed thread information it was called from so
that calling Tcl_AsyncMark(token) will only yield the origin
thread into the asynchronous handler.</p>

<p>Tcl_AsyncCreate creates an asynchronous handler and
returns a token for it. The asynchronous handler must be
created before any occurrences of the asynchronous event
that it is intended to handle (it is not safe to create a
handler at the time of an event). When an asynchronous event
occurs the code that detects the event (such as a signal
handler) should call Tcl_AsyncMark with the token for the
handler. Tcl_Async- Mark will mark the handler as ready to
execute, but it will not invoke the handler immediately. Tcl
will call the proc associated with the handler later, when
the world is in a safe state, and proc can then carry out
the actions associated with the asynchronous event. Proc
should have arguments and result that match the type
Tcl_AsyncProc: typedef int Tcl_AsyncProc( ClientData
clientData, Tcl_Interp *interp, int code); The clientData
will be the same as the clientData argument passed to
Tcl_AsyncCreate when the handler was created. If proc is
invoked just after a command has completed execution in an
interpreter, then interp will identify the interpreter in
which the command was evaluated and code will be the
completion code returned by that command. The com- mand s
result will be present in the interpreters result. When proc
returns, whatever it leaves in the interpreter s result will
be returned as the result of the command and the integer
value returned by proc will be used as the new completion
code for the command.</p>

<p>It is also possible for proc to be invoked when no
interpreter is active. This can happen, for example, if an
asynchronous event occurs while the application is waiting
for interactive input or an X event. In this case interp
will be NULL and code will be 0, and the return value from
proc will be ignored.</p>

<p>The procedure Tcl_AsyncInvoke is called to invoke all of
the handlers that are ready. The procedure Tcl_AsyncReady
will return non-zero whenever any asynchronous handlers are
ready; it can be checked to avoid calls to Tcl_AsyncInvoke
when there are no ready handlers. Tcl calls Tcl_AsyncReady
after each command is evaluated and calls Tcl_AsyncInvoke if
needed. Applications may also call Tcl_AsyncInvoke at
interesting times for that application. For example, Tcls
event handler calls Tcl_AsyncReady after each event and
calls Tcl_AsyncInvoke if needed. The interp and code
arguments to Tcl_AsyncInvoke have the same meaning as for
proc: they identify the active interpreter, if any, and the
completion code from the command that just completed.</p>

<p>Tcl_AsyncDelete removes an asynchronous handler so that
its proc will never be invoked again. A handler can be
deleted even when ready, and it will still not be
invoked.</p>

<p>If multiple handlers become active at the same time, the
handlers are invoked in the order they were created (oldest
handler first). The code and the interpreter s result for
later handlers reflect the values returned by earlier
handlers, so that the most recently created handler has last
say about the interpreter s result and completion code. If
new handlers become ready while handlers are executing,
Tcl_AsyncInvoke will invoke them all; at each point it
invokes the highest-priority (oldest) ready handler,
repeating this over and over until there are no longer any
ready handlers.</p>

<p>WARNING It is almost always a bad idea for an
asynchronous event handler to modify the interpreter s
result or return a code different from its code argument.
This sort of behavior can disrupt the execution of scripts
in subtle ways and result in bugs that are extremely
difficult to track down. If an asynchronous event handler
needs to evaluate Tcl scripts then it should first save the
interpreters state by calling Tcl_SaveInterpState, passing
in the code argument. When the asyn- chronous handler is
finished it should restore the interpreters state by calling
Tcl_RestoreInterpState, and then returning the code argu-
ment.</p>
