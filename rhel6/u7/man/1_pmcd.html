<p>NAME pmcd - performance metrics collector daemon</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pmcd [-AfS] [-c config] [-C dirname] [-H
hostname] [-i ipaddress] [-l logfile] [-L bytes] [-[n|N]
pmnsfile] [-p port[,port ...] [-P pass- file] [-q timeout]
[-s sockname] [-T traceflag] [-t timeout] [-U user- name]
[-x file]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pmcd is the collector used by the
Performance Co-Pilot (see PCPIn- tro(1)) to gather
performance metrics on a system. As a rule, there must be an
instance of pmcd running on a system for any performance
metrics to be available to the PCP.</p>

<p>pmcd accepts connections from client applications
running either on the same machine or remotely and provides
them with metrics and other related information from the
machine that pmcd is executing on. pmcd delegates most of
this request servicing to a collection of Performance
Metrics Domain Agents (or just agents), where each agent is
responsible for a particular group of metrics, known as the
domain of the agent. For example the postgresql agent is
responsible for reporting informa- tion relating to the
PostgreSQL database, such as the transaction and query
counts, indexing and replication statistics, and so on.</p>

<p>The agents may be processes started by pmcd, independent
processes or Dynamic Shared Objects (DSOs, see dlopen(3))
attached to pmcds address space. The configuration section
below describes how connections to agents are specified.</p>

<p>The options to pmcd are as follows.</p>

<p>-A Disable service advertisement. By default, pmcd will
advertise its presence on the network using any available
mechanisms (such as Avahi/DNS-SD), assisting remote
monitoring tools with finding it. These mechanisms are
disabled with this option.</p>

<p>-c config On startup pmcd uses a configuration file from
either the $PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH, configuration variable in
/etc/pcp.conf, or an environment variable of the same name.
However, these values may be overridden with config using
this option. The format of this configuration file is
described below.</p>

<p>-C dirname Specify the path to the Network Security
Services certificate database, for (optional) secure
connections. The default is /etc/pki/nssdb. Refer also to
the -P option. If it does not already exist, this database
can be created using the certutil utility. This process and
other certificate database mainte- nance information is
provided in the PCPIntro(1) manual page and the online PCP
tutorials.</p>

<p>-f By default pmcd is started as a daemon. The -f option
indicates that it should run in the foreground. This is most
useful when trying to diagnose problems with misbehaving
agents.</p>

<p>-H hostname This option can be used to set the hostname
that pmcd will use to represent this instance of itself.
This is used by client tools like pmlogger(1) when reporting
on the (possibly remote) host. If this option is not set,
the pmcd.hostname metric will match that returned by
pmhostname(1). Refer to the manual page for that tool for
full details on how the hostname is evaluated.</p>

<p>-i ipaddress This option is usually only used on hosts
with more than one network interface. If no -i options are
specified pmcd accepts connections made to any of its host s
IP (Internet Protocol) addresses. The -i option is used to
specify explicitly an IP address that connections should be
accepted on. ipaddress should be in the standard dotted form
(e.g. 100.23.45.6). The -i option may be used multiple times
to define a list of IP addresses. Connections made to any
other IP addresses the host has will be refused. This can be
used to limit connections to one network interface if the
host is a network gateway. It is also useful if the host
takes over the IP address of another host that has failed.
In such a situation only the standard IP addresses of the
host should be given (not the ones inherited from the failed
host). This allows PCP applications to deter- mine that a
host has failed, rather than connecting to the host that has
assumed the identity of the failed host.</p>

<p>-l logfile By default a log file named pmcd.log is
written in the directory $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd. The -l option
causes the log file to be written to logfile instead of the
default. If the log file can- not be created or is not
writable, output is written to the standard error
instead.</p>

<p>-L bytes PDUs received by pmcd from monitoring clients
are restricted to a maximum size of 65536 bytes by default
to defend against Denial of Service attacks. The -L option
may be used to change the maximum incoming PDU size.</p>

<p>-n pmnsfile Normally pmcd loads the default Performance
Metrics Name Space (PMNS) from $PCP_VAR_DIR/pmns/root,
however if the -n option is specified an alternative
namespace is loaded from the file pmns- file.</p>

<p>-N pmnsfile Same function as -n, except for the handling
of duplicate Per- formance Metric Identifiers (PMIDs) in
pmnsfile - duplicate names are allowed with -n they are not
allowed with -N.</p>

<p>-P passfile Specify the path to a file containing the
Network Security Ser- vices certificate database password
for (optional) secure con- nections, and for databases that
are password protected. Refer also to the -C option. When
using this option, great care should be exercised to ensure
appropriate ownership (&quot;pcp&quot; user, typically) and
permissions on this file (0400, so as to be unreadable by
any user other than the user running the pmcd pro-
cess).</p>

<p>-q timeout The pmcd to agent version exchange protocol
(new in PCP 2.0 - introduced to provide backward
compatibility) uses this timeout to specify how long pmcd
should wait before assuming that no version response is
coming from an agent. If this timeout is reached, the agent
is assumed to be an agent which does not understand the PCP
2.0 protocol. The default timeout interval is five seconds,
but the -q option allows an alternative timeout interval
(which must be greater than zero) to be specified. The unit
of time is seconds.</p>

<p>-S Require that all client connections provide user
credentials. This means that only unix domain sockets, or
authenticated con- nections are permitted (requires secure
sockets support). If any user or group access control
requirements are specified in the pmcd configuration file,
then this mode of operation is automatically entered,
whether the -S flag is specified or not.</p>

<p>-s sockname Specify the path to a local unix domain
socket (for platforms supporting this socket family only).
The default value is $PCP_RUN_DIR/pmcd.socket.</p>

<p>-t timeout To prevent misbehaving clients or agents from
hanging the entire Performance Metrics Collection System
(PMCS), pmcd uses timeouts on PDU exchanges with clients and
agents running as processes. By default the timeout interval
is five seconds. The -t option allows an alternative timeout
interval in seconds to be speci- fied. If timeout is zero,
timeouts are turned off. It is almost impossible to use the
debugger interactively on an agent unless timeouts have been
turned off for its &quot;parent&quot; pmcd.</p>

<p>Once pmcd is running, the timeout may be dynamically
modified by storing an integer value (the timeout in
seconds) into the met- ric pmcd.control.timeout via
pmstore(1).</p>

<p>-T traceflag To assist with error diagnosis for agents
and/or clients of pmcd that are not behaving correctly, an
internal event tracing mech- anism is supported within pmcd.
The value of traceflag is interpreted as a bit field with
the following control functions:</p>

<p>1 enable client connection tracing 2 enable PDU tracing
256 unbuffered event tracing</p>

<p>By default, event tracing is buffered using a circular
buffer that is over-written as new events are recorded. The
default buffer size holds the last 20 events, although this
number may be over-ridden by using pmstore(1) to modify the
metric pmcd.control.tracebufs.</p>

<p>Similarly once pmcd is running, the event tracing
control may be dynamically modified by storing 1 (enable) or
0 (disable) into the metrics pmcd.control.traceconn,
pmcd.control.tracepdu and pmcd.control.tracenobuf. These
metrics map to the bit fields associated with the traceflag
argument for the -T option.</p>

<p>When operating in buffered mode, the event trace buffer
will be dumped whenever an agent connection is terminated by
pmcd, or when any value is stored into the metric
pmcd.control.dumptrace via pmstore(1).</p>

<p>In unbuffered mode, every event will be reported when it
occurs.</p>

<p>-U username User account under which to run pmcd. The
default is the unprivileged &quot;pcp&quot; account in
current versions of PCP, but in older versions the superuser
account (&quot;root&quot;) was used by default.</p>

<p>-x file Before the pmcd logfile can be opened, pmcd may
encounter a fatal error which prevents it from starting. By
default, the output describing this error is sent to
/dev/tty but it may redirected to file.</p>

<p>If a PDU exchange with an agent times out, the agent has
violated the requirement that it delivers metrics with
little or no delay. This is deemed a protocol failure and
the agent is disconnected from pmcd. Any subsequent requests
for information from the agent will fail with a status
indicating that there is no agent to provide it.</p>

<p>It is possible to specify access control to pmcd based
on users, groups and hosts. This allows one to prevent
users, groups of users, and cer- tain hosts from accessing
the metrics provided by pmcd and is described in more detail
in the Section on ACCESS CONTROL below.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION On startup pmcd looks for a configuration
file named $PCP_PMCD- CONF_PATH. This file specifies which
agents cover which performance metrics domains and how pmcd
should make contact with the agents. An optional section
specifying access controls may follow the agent con-
figuration data.</p>

<p>Warning: pmcd is usually started as part of the boot
sequence and runs initially as root. The configuration file
may contain shell commands to create agents, which will be
executed by root. To prevent security breaches the
configuration file should be writable only by root. The use
of absolute path names is also recommended.</p>

<p>The case of the reserved words in the configuration file
is unimpor- tant, but elsewhere, the case is preserved.</p>

<p>Blank lines and comments are permitted (even encouraged)
in the config- uration file. A comment begins with a #
character and finishes at the end of the line. A line may be
continued by ensuring that the last character on the line is
a (backslash). A comment on a continued line ends at the end
of the continued line. Spaces may be included in lexical
elements by enclosing the entire element in double quotes. A
double quote preceded by a backslash is always a literal
double quote. A # in double quotes or preceded by a
backslash is treated liter- ally rather than as a comment
delimiter. Lexical elements and separa- tors are described
further in the following sections.</p>

<p>AGENT CONFIGURATION Each line of the agent configuration
section of the configuration file contains details of how to
connect pmcd to one of its agents and speci- fies which
metrics domain the agent deals with. An agent may be
attached as a DSO, or via a socket, or a pair of pipes.</p>

<p>Each line of the agent configuration section of the
configuration file must be either an agent specification, a
comment, or a blank line. Lexical elements are separated by
whitespace characters, however a sin- gle agent
specification may not be broken across lines unless a
(backslash) is used to continue the line.</p>

<p>Each agent specification must start with a textual label
(string) fol- lowed by an integer in the range 1 to 510. The
label is a tag used to refer to the agent and the integer
specifies the domain for which the agent supplies data. This
domain identifier corresponds to the domain portion of the
PMIDs handled by the agent. Each agent must have a unique
label and domain identifier.</p>

<p>For DSO agents a line of the form:</p>

<p>label domain-no dso entry-point path</p>

<p>should appear. Where,</p>

<p>label is a string identifying the agent domain-no is an
unsigned integer specifying the agents domain in the range 1
to 510 entry-point is the name of an initialization function
which will be called when the DSO is loaded path designates
the location of the DSO and this is expected to be an
absolute pathname. pmcd is only able to load DSO agents that
have the same simabi (Subprogram Inter- face Model ABI, or
calling conventions) as it does (i.e. only one of the simabi
versions will be applicable). The simabi version of a
running pmcd may be determined by fetching pmcd.simabi.
Alternatively, the file(1) command may be used to determine
the simabi version from the pmcd executable.</p>

<p>For a relative path the environment variable PMCD_PATH
defines a colon (:) separated list of directories to search
when trying to locate the agent DSO. The default search path
is $PCP_SHARE_DIR/lib:/usr/pcp/lib.</p>

<p>For agents providing socket connections, a line of the
form</p>

<p>label domain-no socket addr-family address [ command
]</p>

<p>should appear. Where,</p>

<p>label is a string identifying the agent domain-no is an
unsigned integer specifying the agents domain in the range 1
to 510 addr-family designates whether the socket is in the
AF_INET, AF_INET6 or AF_UNIX domain, and the corresponding
values for this parameter are inet, ipv6 and unix
respectively. address specifies the address of the socket
within the previously specified addr-family. For unix
sockets, the address should be the name of an agent s socket
on the local host (a valid address for the UNIX domain). For
inet and ipv6 sockets, the address may be either a port
number or a port name which may be used to connect to an
agent on the local host. There is no syntax for specifying
an agent on a remote host as a pmcd deals only with agents
on the same machine. command is an optional parameter used
to specify a command line to start the agent when pmcd
initializes. If command is not present, pmcd assumes that
the specified agent has already been created. The command is
considered to start from the first non-white character after
the socket address and finish at the next newline that isnt
pre- ceded by a backslash. After a fork(2) the command is
passed unmodified to execve(2) to instantiate the agent.</p>

<p>For agents interacting with the pmcd via stdin/stdout, a
line of the form:</p>

<p>label domain-no pipe protocol command</p>

<p>should appear. Where,</p>

<p>label is a string identifying the agent domain-no is an
unsigned integer specifying the agents domain protocol The
value for this parameter should be binary.</p>

<p>Additionally, the protocol can include the notready key-
word to indicate that the agent must be marked as not being
ready to process requests from pmcd. The agent will
explicitly notify the pmcd when it is ready to process the
requests by sending PM_ERR_PMDAREADY PDU.</p>

<p>command specifies a command line to start the agent when
pmcd initializes. Note that command is mandatory for pipe-
based agents. The command is considered to start from the
first non-white character after the protocol parame- ter and
finish at the next newline that isnt preceded by a
backslash. After a fork(2) the command is passed unmodified
to execve(2) to instantiate the agent.</p>

<p>ACCESS CONTROL CONFIGURATION The access control section
of the configuration file is optional, but if present it
must follow the agent configuration data. The case of
reserved words is ignored, but elsewhere case is preserved.
Lexical elements in the access control section are separated
by whitespace or the special delimiter characters: square
brackets ([ and ]), braces ({ and }), colon (:), semicolon
(;) and comma (,). The special characters are not treated as
special in the agent configuration section. Lexical elements
may be quoted (double quotes) as necessary.</p>

<p>The access control section of the file must start with a
line of the form:</p>

<p>[access]</p>

<p>Leading and trailing whitespace may appear around and
within the brack- ets and the case of the access keyword is
ignored. No other text may appear on the line except a
trailing comment.</p>

<p>Following this line, the remainder of the configuration
file should contain lines that allow or disallow operations
from particular hosts or groups of hosts.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of operations that occur via
pmcd:</p>

<p>fetch allows retrieval of information from pmcd. This
may be information about a metric (e.g. its description,
instance domain or help text) or a value for a metric.</p>

<p>store allows pmcd to be used to store metric values in
agents that permit store operations. This may be the actual
value of the metric (e.g. resetting a counter to zero).
Alternatively, it may be a value used by the PMDA to
introduce a change to some aspect of monitoring of that
metric (e.g. server side event filtering) - possibly even
only for the active client tool performing the store
operation, and not others.</p>

<p>Access to pmcd can be granted in three ways - by user,
group of users, or at a host level. In the latter, all users
on a host are granted the same level of access, unless the
user or group access control mechanism is also in use.</p>

<p>User names and group names will be verified using the
local /etc/passwd and /etc/groups files (or an alternative
directory service), using the getpwent(3) and getgrent(3)
routines.</p>

<p>Hosts may be identified by name, IP address, IPv6
address or by the special host specifications
&quot;unix:&quot; or &quot;local:&quot;. &quot;unix:&quot;
refers to pmcs unix domain socket, on supported platforms.
&quot;local:&quot; is equivalent to specifying
&quot;unix:&quot; and localhost .</p>

<p>Wildcards may also be specified by ending the host
identifier with the single wildcard character * as the
last-given component of an address. The wildcard
&quot;.*&quot; refers to all inet (IPv4) addresses. The
wildcard &quot;:*&quot; refers to all IPv6 addresses. If an
IPv6 wild- card contains a :: component, then the final *
refers to the final 16 bits of the address only, otherwise
it refers to the remaining unspecified bits of the
address.</p>

<p>The wildcard * refers to all users, groups or host
addresses, including &quot;unix:&quot;. Names of users,
groups or hosts may not be wildcarded.</p>

<p>The following are all valid host identifiers:</p>

<p>boing localhost giggle.melbourne.sgi.com 129.127.112.2
129.127.114.* 129.* .* fe80::223:14ff:feaf:b62c
fe80::223:14ff:feaf:* fe80:* :* &quot;unix:&quot;
&quot;local:&quot; *</p>

<p>The following are not valid host identifiers:</p>

<p>*.melbourne 129.127.*.* 129.*.114.9 129.127*
fe80::223:14ff:*:* fe80::223:14ff:*:b62c fe80*</p>

<p>The first example is not allowed because only (numeric)
IP addresses may contain a wildcard. The second and fifth
examples are not valid because there is more than one
wildcard character. The third and sixth contain an embedded
wildcard, the fourth and seventh have a wildcard character
that is not the last component of the address (the last com-
ponents are 127* and fe80* respectively).</p>

<p>The name localhost is given special treatment to make
the behavior of host wildcarding consistent. Rather than
being 127.0.0.1 and ::1, it is mapped to the primary inet
and IPv6 addresses associated with the name of the host on
which pmcd is running. Beware of this when running pmcd on
multi-homed hosts.</p>

<p>Access for users, groups or hosts are allowed or
disallowed by specify- ing statements of the form:</p>

<p>allow users userlist : operations ; disallow users
userlist : operations ; allow groups grouplist : operations
; disallow groups grouplist : operations ; allow hosts
hostlist : operations ; disallow hosts hostlist : operations
;</p>

<p>list userlist, grouplist and hostlist are comma
separated lists of one or more users, groups or host
identifiers.</p>

<p>operations is a comma separated list of the operation
types described above, all (which allows/disallows all
opera- tions), or all except operations (which
allows/disallows all operations except those listed).</p>

<p>Either plural or singular forms of users, groups, and
hosts keywords are allowed. If this keyword is omitted, a
default of hosts will be used. This behaviour is for
backward-compatibility only, it is prefer- able to be
explicit.</p>

<p>Where no specific allow or disallow statement applies to
an operation, the default is to allow the operation from all
users, groups and hosts. In the trivial case when there is
no access control section in the con- figuration file, all
operations from all users, groups, and hosts are
permitted.</p>

<p>If a new connection to pmcd is attempted by a user,
group or host that is not permitted to perform any
operations, the connection will be closed immediately after
an error response PM_ERR_PERMISSION has been sent to the
client attempting the connection.</p>

<p>Statements with the same level of wildcarding specifying
identical hosts may not contradict each other. For example
if a host named clank had an IP address of 129.127.112.2,
specifying the following two rules would be erroneous:</p>

<p>allow host clank : fetch, store; disallow host
129.127.112.2 : all except fetch;</p>

<p>because they both refer to the same host, but disagree
as to whether the fetch operation is permitted from that
host.</p>

<p>Statements containing more specific host specifications
override less specific ones according to the level of
wildcarding. For example a rule of the form</p>

<p>allow host clank : all;</p>

<p>overrides</p>

<p>disallow host 129.127.112.* : all except fetch;</p>

<p>because the former contains a specific host name
(equivalent to a fully specified IP address), whereas the
latter has a wildcard. In turn, the latter would
override</p>

<p>disallow host * : all;</p>

<p>It is possible to limit the number of connections from a
user, group or host to pmcd. This may be done by adding a
clause of the form</p>

<p>maximum n connections</p>

<p>to the operations list of an allow statement. Such a
clause may not be used in a disallow statement. Here, n is
the maximum number of connec- tions that will be accepted
from the user, group or host matching the identifier(s) used
in the statement.</p>

<p>An access control statement with a list of user, group
or host identi- fiers is equivalent to a set of access
control statements, with each specifying one of the
identifiers in the list and all with the same access
controls (both permissions and connection limits). A group
should be used if you want users to contribute to a shared
connection limit. A wildcard should be used if you want
hosts to contribute to a shared connection limit.</p>

<p>When a new client requests a connection, and pmcd has
determined that the client has permission to connect, it
searches the matching list of access control statements for
the most specific match containing a con- nection limit. For
brevity, this will be called the limiting state- ment. If
there is no limiting statement, the client is granted a con-
nection. If there is a limiting statement and the number of
pmcd clients with user ID, group ID, or IP addresses that
match the identi- fier in the limiting statement is less
than the connection limit in the statement, the connection
is allowed. Otherwise the connection limit has been reached
and the client is refused a connection.</p>

<p>Group access controls and the wildcarding in host
identifiers means that once pmcd actually accepts a
connection from a client, the connec- tion may contribute to
the current connection count of more than one access control
statement - the clients host may match more than one access
control statement, and similarly the user ID may be in more
than one group. This may be significant for subsequent
connection requests.</p>

<p>Note that pmcd enters a mode where it runs effectively
with a higher- level of security as soon as a user or group
access control section is added to the configuration. In
this mode only authenticated connec- tions are allowed -
either from a SASL authenticated connection, or a Unix
domain socket (which implicitly passes client credentials).
This is the same mode that is entered explicitly using the
-S option. Assuming permission is allowed, one can determine
whether pmcd is run- ning in this mode by querying the value
of the pmcd.fea- ture.creds_required metric.</p>

<p>Note also that because most specific match semantics are
used when checking the connection limit, for the host-based
access control case, priority is given to clients with more
specific host identifiers. It is also possible to exceed
connection limits in some situations. Con- sider the
following:</p>

<p>allow host clank : all, maximum 5 connections; allow
host * : all except store, maximum 2 connections;</p>

<p>This says that only 2 client connections at a time are
permitted for all hosts other than &quot;clank&quot;, which
is permitted 5. If a client from host &quot;boing&quot; is
the first to connect to pmcd, its connection is checked
against the second statement (that is the most specific
match with a connection limit). As there are no other
clients, the connection is accepted and contributes towards
the limit for only the second state- ment above. If the next
client connects from &quot;clank&quot;, its connection is
checked against the limit for the first statement. There are
no other connections from &quot;clank&quot;, so the
connection is accepted. Once this connection is accepted, it
counts towards both statements limits because
&quot;clank&quot; matches the host identifier in both
statements. Remem- ber that the decision to accept a new
connection is made using only the most specific matching
access control statement with a connection limit. Now, the
connection limit for the second statement has been reached.
Any connections from hosts other than &quot;clank&quot; will
be refused.</p>

<p>If instead, pmcd with no clients saw three successive
connections arrived from &quot;boing&quot;, the first two
would be accepted and the third refused. After that, if a
connection was requested from &quot;clank&quot; it would be
accepted. It matches the first statement, which is more spe-
cific than the second, so the connection limit in the first
is used to determine that the client has the right to
connect. Now there are 3 connections contributing to the
second statement s connection limit. Even though the
connection limit for the second statement has been exceeded,
the earlier connections from &quot;boing&quot; are
maintained. The connection limit is only checked at the time
a client attempts a con- nection rather than being
re-evaluated every time a new client connects to pmcd.</p>

<p>This gentle scheme is designed to allow reasonable
limits to be imposed on a first come first served basis,
with specific exceptions.</p>

<p>As illustrated by the example above, a client s
connection is honored once it has been accepted. However,
pmcd reconfiguration (see the next section) re-evaluates all
the connection counts and will cause client connections to
be dropped where connection limits have been exceeded.</p>

<p>RECONFIGURING PMCD If the configuration file has been
changed or if an agent is not responding because it has
terminated or the PMNS has been changed, pmcd may be
reconfigured by sending it a SIGHUP, as in</p>

<p># pmsignal -a -s HUP pmcd</p>

<p>When pmcd receives a SIGHUP, it checks the configuration
file for changes. If the file has been modified, it is
reparsed and the con- tents become the new configuration. If
there are errors in the config- uration file, the existing
configuration is retained and the contents of the file are
ignored. Errors are reported in the pmcd log file.</p>

<p>It also checks the PMNS file for changes. If the PMNS
file has been modified, then it is reloaded. Use of tail(1)
on the log file is rec- ommended while reconfiguring
pmcd.</p>

<p>If the configuration for an agent has changed (any
parameter except the agents label is different), the agent
is restarted. Agents whose con- figurations do not change
are not restarted. Any existing agents not present in the
new configuration are terminated. Any deceased agents are
that are still listed are restarted.</p>

<p>Sometimes it is necessary to restart an agent that is
still running, but malfunctioning. Simply stop the agent
(e.g. using SIGTERM from pmsignal(1)), then send pmcd a
SIGHUP, which will cause the agent to be restarted.</p>

<p>STARTING AND STOPPING PMCD Normally, pmcd is started
automatically at boot time and stopped when the system is
being brought down (see rc2(1M) and rc0(1M)). Under cer-
tain circumstances it is necessary to start or stop pmcd
manually. To do this one must become superuser and type</p>

<p># $PCP_RC_DIR/pcp start</p>

<p>to start pmcd, or</p>

<p># $PCP_RC_DIR/pcp stop</p>

<p>to stop pmcd. Starting pmcd when it is already running
is the same as stopping it and then starting it again.</p>

<p>Sometimes it may be necessary to restart pmcd during
another phase of the boot process. Time-consuming parts of
the boot process are often put into the background to allow
the system to become available sooner (e.g. mounting huge
databases). If an agent run by pmcd requires such a task to
complete before it can run properly, it is necessary to
restart or reconfigure pmcd after the task completes.
Consider, for example, the case of mounting a database in
the background while boot- ing. If the PMDA which provides
the metrics about the database cannot function until the
database is mounted and available but pmcd is started before
the database is ready, the PMDA will fail (however pmcd will
still service requests for metrics from other domains). If
the database is initialized by running a shell script,
adding a line to the end of the script to reconfigure pmcd
(by sending it a SIGHUP) will restart the PMDA (if it exited
because it couldnt connect to the database). If the PMDA
didnt exit in such a situation it would be necessary to
restart pmcd because if the PMDA was still running pmcd
would not restart it.</p>

<p>Normally pmcd listens for client connections on TCP/IP
port number 44321 (registered at http://www.iana.org/).
Either the environment variable PMCD_PORT or the -p command
line option may be used to specify alternative port
number(s) when pmcd is started; in each case, the
specification is a comma-separated list of one or more
numerical port numbers. Should both methods be used or
multiple -p options appear on the command line, pmcd will
listen on the union of the set of ports specified via all -p
options and the PMCD_PORT environment variable. If
non-default ports are used with pmcd care should be taken to
ensure that PMCD_PORT is also set in the environment of any
client application that will connect to pmcd, or that the
extended host specification syn- tax is used (see
PCPIntro(1) for details).</p>

<p>FILES $PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH default configuration file
$PCP_PMCDOPTIONS_PATH command line options to pmcd when
launched from $PCP_RC_DIR/pcp All the command line option
lines should start with a hyphen as the first character.
This file can also contain environment variable settings of
the form &quot;VARI- ABLE=value&quot;. ./pmcd.log (or
$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/pmcd.log when started automatically)
$PCP_RUN_DIR/pmcd.pid contains an ascii decimal
representation of the process ID of pmcd , when its running.

certificate database directory, used for optional Secure
Socket Layer connections. This database can be created and
queried using the NSS certu- til tool, amongst others.

<p>ENVIRONMENT In addition to the PCP environment variables
described in the PCP ENVI- RONMENT section below, the
PMCD_PORT variable is also recognised as the TCP/IP port for
incoming connections (default 44321), and the PMCD_SOCKET
variable is also recognised as the path to be used for the
Unix domain socket.</p>

<p>PCP ENVIRONMENT Environment variables with the prefix
PCP_ are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP. On each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in pcp.conf(5).</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS If pmcd is already running the message
&quot;Error: OpenRequestSocket bind: Address may already be
in use&quot; will appear. This may also appear if pmcd was
shutdown with an outstanding request from a client. In this
case, a request socket has been left in the TIME_WAIT state
and until the system closes it down (after some timeout
period) it will not be possible to run pmcd.</p>

<p>In addition to the standard PCP debugging flags, see
pmdbg(1), pmcd currently uses DBG_TRACE_APPL0 for tracing
I/O and termination of agents, DBG_TRACE_APPL1 for tracing
access control and DBG_TRACE_APPL2 for tracing the
configuration file scanner and parser.</p>

<p>CAVEATS pmcd does not explicitly terminate its children
(agents), it only closes their pipes. If an agent never
checks for a closed pipe it may not terminate.</p>

<p>The configuration file parser will only read lines of
less than 1200 characters. This is intended to prevent
accidents with binary files.</p>

<p>The timeouts controlled by the -t option apply to IPC
between pmcd and the PMDAs it spawns. This is independent of
settings of the environ- ment variables PMCD_CONNECT_TIMEOUT
and PMCD_REQUEST_TIMEOUT (see PCPIntro(1)) which may be used
respectively to control timeouts for client applications
trying to connect to pmcd and trying to receive information
from pmcd.</p>
