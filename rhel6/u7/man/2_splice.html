<p>SPLICE(2) Linux Programmer s Manual SPLICE(2)</p>

<p>NAME splice - splice data to/from a pipe</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #define _GNU_SOURCE #include
&lt;fcntl.h&gt;</p>

<p>long splice(int fd_in, loff_t *off_in, int fd_out,
loff_t *off_out, size_t len, unsigned int flags);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION splice() moves data between two file
descriptors without copying between kernel address space and
user address space. It transfers up to len bytes of data
from the file descriptor fd_in to the file descriptor
fd_out, where one of the descriptors must refer to a
pipe.</p>

<p>If fd_in refers to a pipe, then off_in must be NULL. If
fd_in does not refer to a pipe and off_in is NULL, then
bytes are read from fd_in starting from the current file
offset, and the current file offset is adjusted
appropriately. If fd_in does not refer to a pipe and off_in
is not NULL, then off_in must point to a buffer which
specifies the starting offset from which bytes will be read
from fd_in; in this case, the current file offset of fd_in
is not changed. Analogous statements apply for fd_out and
off_out.</p>

<p>The flags argument is a bit mask that is composed by
ORing together zero or more of the following values:</p>

<p>SPLICE_F_MOVE Attempt to move pages instead of copying.
This is only a hint to the kernel: pages may still be copied
if the kernel cannot move the pages from the pipe, or if the
pipe buffers dont refer to full pages. The initial
implementation of this flag was buggy: therefore starting in
Linux 2.6.21 it is a no-op (but is still permitted in a
splice() call); in the future, a correct implementation may
be restored.</p>

<p>SPLICE_F_NONBLOCK Do not block on I/O. This makes the
splice pipe operations non-blocking, but splice() may
neverthe- less block because the file descriptors that are
spliced to/from may block (unless they have the O_NONBLOCK
flag set).</p>

<p>SPLICE_F_MORE More data will be coming in a subsequent
splice. This is a helpful hint when the fd_out refers to a
socket (see also the description of MSG_MORE in send(2), and
the description of TCP_CORK in tcp(7))</p>

<p>SPLICE_F_GIFT Unused for splice(); see vmsplice(2).</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, splice()
returns the number of bytes spliced to or from the pipe. A
return value of 0 means that there was no data to transfer,
and it would not make sense to block, because there are no
writers connected to the write end of the pipe referred to
by fd_in.</p>

<p>On error, splice() returns -1 and errno is set to
indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS EBADF One or both file descriptors are not valid,
or do not have proper read-write mode.</p>

<p>EINVAL Target file system doesnt support splicing;
target file is opened in append mode; neither of the
descriptors refers to a pipe; or offset given for
non-seekable device.</p>

<p>ENOMEM Out of memory.</p>

<p>ESPIPE Either off_in or off_out was not NULL, but the
corresponding file descriptor refers to a pipe.</p>

<p>VERSIONS The splice() system call first appeared in
Linux 2.6.17.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO This system call is Linux-specific.</p>

<p>NOTES The three system calls splice(), vmsplice(2), and
tee(2), provide userspace programs with full control over an
arbitrary kernel buffer, implemented within the kernel using
the same type of buffer that is used for a pipe. In
overview, these system calls perform the following
tasks:</p>

<p>splice() moves data from the buffer to an arbitrary file
descriptor, or vice versa, or from one buffer to
another.</p>

<p>tee(2) &quot;copies&quot; the data from one buffer to
another.</p>

<p>vmsplice(2) &quot;copies&quot; data from user space into
the buffer.</p>

<p>Though we talk of copying, actual copies are generally
avoided. The kernel does this by implementing a pipe buffer
as a set of reference- counted pointers to pages of kernel
memory. The kernel creates &quot;copies&quot; of pages in a
buffer by creating new pointers (for the output buffer)
referring to the pages, and increasing the reference counts
for the pages: only pointers are copied, not the pages of
the buffer.</p>
