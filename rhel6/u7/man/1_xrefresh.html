<p>NAME xrefresh - refresh all or part of an X screen</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS xrefresh [-option ...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Xrefresh is a simple X program that causes
all or part of your screen to be repainted. This is useful
when system messages have messed up your screen. Xrefresh
maps a window on top of the desired area of the screen and
then immediately unmaps it, causing refresh events to be
sent to all applications. By default, a window with no
background is used, causing all applications to repaint
smoothly. However, the various options can be used to
indicate that a solid background (of any color) or the root
window background should be used instead.</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS -white Use a white background. The screen just
appears to flash quickly, and then repaint.</p>

<p>-black Use a black background (in effect, turning off
all of the electron guns to the tube). This can be somewhat
disorient- ing as everything goes black for a moment.</p>

<p>-solid color Use a solid background of the specified
color. Try green.</p>

<p>-root Use the root window background.</p>

<p>-none This is the default. All of the windows simply
repaint.</p>

<p>-geometry WxH+X+Y Specifies the portion of the screen to
be repainted; see X(7).</p>

<p>-display display This argument allows you to specify the
server and screen to refresh; see X(7).</p>

<p>X DEFAULTS The xrefresh program uses the routine
XGetDefault(3) to read defaults, so its resource names are
all capitalized.</p>

<p>Black, White, Solid, None, Root Determines what sort of
window background to use.</p>

<p>Geometry Determines the area to refresh. Not very
useful.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT DISPLAY - To get default host and display
number.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO X(7)</p>

<p>BUGS It should have just one default type for the
background.</p>
