<p>FACCESSAT(2) Linux Programmer s Manual FACCESSAT(2)</p>

<p>NAME faccessat - check users permissions of a file
relative to a directory file descriptor</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #define _ATFILE_SOURCE #include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;
/* Definition of AT_* constants */ #include
&lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>int faccessat(int dirfd, const char *pathname, int mode,
int flags);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The faccessat() system call operates in
exactly the same way as access(2), except for the
differences described in this manual page.</p>

<p>If the pathname given in pathname is relative, then it
is interpreted relative to the directory referred to by the
file descriptor dirfd (rather than relative to the current
working directory of the calling process, as is done by
access(2) for a relative pathname).</p>

<p>If pathname is relative and dirfd is the special value
AT_FDCWD, then pathname is interpreted relative to the
current working directory of the calling process (like
access(2)).</p>

<p>If pathname is absolute, then dirfd is ignored.</p>

<p>flags is constructed by ORing together zero or more of
the following values:</p>

<p>AT_EACCESS Perform access checks using the effective
user and group IDs. By default, faccessat() uses the real
IDs (like access(2)).</p>

<p>AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW If pathname is a symbolic link, do
not dereference it: instead return information about the
link itself.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, (all requested permissions
granted) faccessat() returns 0. On error, -1 is returned and
errno is set to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The same errors that occur for access(2) can also
occur for facces- sat(). The following additional errors can
occur for faccessat():</p>

<p>EBADF dirfd is not a valid file descriptor.</p>

<p>EINVAL Invalid flag specified in flags.</p>

<p>ENOTDIR pathname is relative and dirfd is a file
descriptor referring to a file other than a directory.</p>

<p>VERSIONS faccessat() was added to Linux in kernel
2.6.16.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO POSIX.1-2008.</p>

<p>NOTES See openat(2) for an explanation of the need for
faccessat().</p>

<p>Glibc Notes The AT_EACCESS and AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW flags
are actually implemented within the glibc wrapper function
for faccessat(). If either of these flags are specified,
then the wrapper function employs fstatat(2) to determine
access permissions.</p>
