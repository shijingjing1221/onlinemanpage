<p>NAME pnmpad - add borders to a PNM image</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pnmpad [-verbose] [-white|-black]
[-width=pixels] [-halign=ratio] [-left=pixels]
[-right=pixels] [-height=pixels] [-valign=ratio]
[-top=pixels] [-bottom=pixels] [pnmfile]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pnmpad reads a PNM image as input and outputs a PNM
image that is the input image plus black or white borders of
the sizes specified.</p>

<p>If you just need to convert an image to a certain size
regardless of the original dimensions, pamcut with the -pad
option may be a better choice.</p>

<p>pnmmargin does essentially the same thing, but allows
you to add bor- ders of any color and requires all four
borders to be the same size.</p>

<p>OPTIONS All options can be abbreviated to their shortest
unique prefix. You may use two hyphens instead of one to
designate an option. You may use either white space or an
equals sign between an option name and its value.</p>

<p>-verbose Verbose output.</p>

<p>-white</p>

<p>-black Set pad color. Default is -black.</p>

<p>-left=pixels</p>

<p>-right=pixels</p>

<p>-width=width</p>

<p>-halign=ratio Specify amount of left and right padding
in pixels.</p>

<p>-left and -right directly specify the amount of padding
added to the left and right sides, respectively, of the
image.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can specify -width and just one of
-left and -right and pnmpad calculates the required padding
on the other side based on the width of the input image. If
the -width value is less than the width of the image plus
the specified padding, the -width values is ignored.</p>

<p>If you specify all three of -width, -left, and -right,
you must ensure that the -left and -right padding are
sufficient to make the image at least as wide as -width
specifies. Otherwise, pnm- pad fails.</p>

<p>When you specify -width without -left or -right, and
-width is larger than the input image, pnmpad chooses left
and right padding amounts in a certain ratio. That ratio
defaults to half, but you can set it to anything (from 0 to
1) with the -halign option. If the input image is already at
least as wide as -width specifies, pnmpad adds no
padding.</p>

<p>Common values for -halign are:</p>

<p>0.0 left aligned</p>

<p>0.5 center aligned (default)</p>

<p>1.0 right aligned</p>

<p>Before Netpbm 10.23 (July 2004), pnmpad did not allow
the -left or -right option together with -width.</p>

<p>-top=pixels</p>

<p>-bottom=pixels</p>

<p>-height=height</p>

<p>-valign=ratio These options determine the vertical
padding. They are analo- gous to the horizontal padding
options above.</p>

<p>HISTORY Before February 2002, pnmpad had a different
option syntax which was less expressive and not like
conventional Netpbm programs. That syntax is still
understood by pnmpad for backward compatibility, but not
docu- mented or supported for future use.</p>
