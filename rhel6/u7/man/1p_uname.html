<p>UNAME(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual UNAME(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME uname - return system name</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS uname [-snrvma]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION By default, the uname utility shall write
the operating system name to standard output. When options
are specified, symbols representing one or more system
characteristics shall be written to the standard output. The
format and contents of the symbols are
implementation-defined. On systems conforming to the System
Interfaces volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, the symbols
written shall be those supported by the uname() function as
defined in the System Interfaces volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The uname utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>The following options shall be supported:</p>

<p>-a Behave as though all of the options -mnrsv were
specified.</p>

<p>-m Write the name of the hardware type on which the
system is run- ning to standard output.</p>

<p>-n Write the name of this node within an
implementation-defined communications network.</p>

<p>-r Write the current release level of the operating
system imple- mentation.</p>

<p>-s Write the name of the implementation of the operating
system.</p>

<p>-v Write the current version level of this release of
the operating system implementation.</p>

<p>If no options are specified, the uname utility shall
write the operat- ing system name, as if the -s option had
been specified.</p>

<p>OPERANDS None.</p>

<p>STDIN Not used.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of uname:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in
arguments).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT By default, the output shall be a single line of
the following form:</p>

<p>&quot;%n&quot;, &lt;sysname&gt;</p>

<p>If the -a option is specified, the output shall be a
single line of the following form:</p>

<p>&quot;%s %s %s %s %n&quot;, &lt;sysname&gt;,
&lt;nodename&gt;, &lt;release&gt;, &lt;version&gt;,
&lt;machine&gt;</p>

<p>Additional implementation-defined symbols may be
written; all such sym- bols shall be written at the end of
the line of output before the &lt;new- line&gt;.</p>

<p>If options are specified to select different
combinations of the sym- bols, only those symbols shall be
written, in the order shown above for the -a option. If a
symbol is not selected for writing, its correspond- ing
trailing &lt;blank&gt;s also shall not be written.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 The requested information was successfully
written.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE Note that any of the symbols could
include embedded &lt;space&gt;s, which may affect parsing
algorithms if multiple options are selected for output.</p>

<p>The node name is typically a name that the system uses
to identify itself for inter-system communication
addressing.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES The following command:</p>

<p>uname -sr</p>

<p>writes the operating system name and release level,
separated by one or more &lt;blank&gt;s.</p>

<p>RATIONALE It was suggested that this utility cannot be
used portably since the format of the symbols is
implementation-defined. The POSIX.1 working group could not
achieve consensus on defining these formats in the
underlying uname() function, and there was no expectation
that this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 would be any more
successful. Some applications may still find this historical
utility of value. For exam- ple, the symbols could be used
for system log entries or for comparison with operator or
user input.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
