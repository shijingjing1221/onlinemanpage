<p>NAME 411toppm - convert Sony Mavica .411 image to
PPM</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS 411toppm [-width width] [-height height]
[411file]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>411toppm reads a .411 file, such as from a Sony Mavic
camera, and con- verts it to a PPM image as output.</p>

<p>Output is to Standard Output.</p>

<p>The originator of this program and decipherer of the
.411 format, Steve Allen &lt;sla@alumni.caltech.edu&gt;, has
this to say about the utility of this program: Theres so
little image in a 64x48 thumbnail (especially when you have
the full size JPG file) that the only point in doing this
was to answer the implicit challenge posed by the manual
stating that only the camera can use these files.</p>

<p>OPTIONS All options may be abbreviated to the shortest
unique prefix.</p>

<p>-width The width (number of columns) of the input image.
Default is 64.</p>

<p>-height The height (number of rows) of the input image.
Default is 48.</p>
