<p>NAME capinfos - Prints information about capture
files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS capinfos [ -a ] [ -A ] [ -b ] [ -B ] [ -c ] [
-C ] [ -d ] [ -e ] [ -E ] [ -h ] [ -H ] [ -i ] [ -l ] [ -L ]
[ -m ] [ -N ] [ -o ] [ -q ] [ -Q ] [ -r ] [ -R ] [ -s ] [ -S
] [ -t ] [ -T ] [ -u ] [ -x ] [ -y ] [ -z ] &lt;infile&gt;
...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Capinfos is a program that reads one or more
capture files and returns some or all available statistics
(infos) of each &lt;infile&gt; in one of two types of output
formats: long or table.</p>

<p>The long output is suitable for a human to read. The
table output is useful for generating a report that can be
easily imported into a spreadsheet or database.</p>

<p>The user specifies what type of output (long or table)
and which statistics to display by specifying flags
(options) that corresponding to the report type and desired
infos. If no options are specified, Capinfos will report all
statistics available in &quot;long&quot; format.</p>

<p>Options are processed from left to right order with
later options superseding or adding to earlier options.</p>

<p>Capinfos is able to detect and read the same capture
files that are supported by Wireshark. The input files dont
need a specific filename extension; the file format and an
optional gzip compression will be automatically detected.
Near the beginning of the DESCRIPTION section of
wireshark(1) or
&lt;http://www.wireshark.org/docs/man-pages/wireshark.html&gt;
is a detailed description of the way Wireshark handles this,
which is the same way Capinfos handles this.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -a Displays the start time of the capture.
Capinfos considers the earliest timestamp seen to be the
start time, so the first packet in the capture is not
necessarily the earliest - if packets exist
&quot;out-of-order&quot;, time-wise, in the capture,
Capinfos detects this.</p>

<p>-A Generate all infos. By default capinfos will display
all infos values for each input file, but enabling any of
the individual display infos options will disable the
generate all option.</p>

<p>-b Separate infos with ASCII SPACE (0x20) characters.
This option is only useful when generating a table style
report (-T). The various info values will be separated
(delimited) from one another with a single ASCII SPACE
character.</p>

<p>NOTE: Since some of the header labels as well as some of
the value fields contain SPACE characters. This option is of
limited value unless one of the quoting options (-q or -Q)
is also specified.</p>

<p>-B Separate the infos with ASCII TAB characters. This
option is only useful when generating a table style report
(-T). The various info values will be separated (delimited)
from one another with a single ASCII TAB character. The TAB
character is the default delimiter when -T style report is
enabled.</p>

<p>-c Displays the number of packets in the capture
file.</p>

<p>-C Cancel processing any additional files if and when
capinfos should fail to open an input file. By default
capinfos will attempt to open each and every file name
argument.</p>

<p>Note: An error message will be written to stderr
whenever capinfos fails to open a file regardless of whether
the -C option is specified or not. Upon exit, capinfos will
return an error status if any errors occurred during
processing.</p>

<p>-d Displays the total length of all packets in the file,
in bytes. This counts the size of the packets as they
appeared in their original form, not as they appear in this
file. For example, if a packet was originally 1514 bytes and
only 256 of those bytes were saved to the capture file (if
packets were captured with a snaplen or other slicing
option), Capinfos will consider the packet to have been 1514
bytes.</p>

<p>-e Displays the end time of the capture. Capinfos
considers the latest timestamp seen to be the end time, so
the last packet in the capture is not necessarily the latest
- if packets exist &quot;out-of- order&quot;, time-wise, in
the capture, Capinfos detects this.</p>

<p>-E Displays the per-file encapsulation of the capture
file.</p>

<p>-h Prints the help listing and exits.</p>

<p>-H Displays the SHA1, RIPEMD160, and MD5 hashes for the
file.</p>

<p>-i Displays the average data rate, in bits/sec</p>

<p>-l Display the snaplen (if any) for a file. snaplen (if
available) is determined from the capture file header and by
looking for truncated records in the capture file.</p>

<p>-L Generate long report. Capinfos can generate two
different styles of reports. The &quot;long&quot; report is
the default style of output and is suitable for a human to
use.</p>

<p>-m Separate the infos with comma (,) characters. This
option is only useful when generating a table style report
(-T). The various info values will be separated (delimited)
from one another with a single comma &quot;,&quot;
character.</p>

<p>-N Do not quote the infos. This option is only useful
when generating a table style report (-T). Excluding any
quoting characters around the various values and using a TAB
delimiter produces a very &quot;clean&quot; table report
that is easily parsed with CLI tools. By default infos are
NOT quoted.</p>

<p>-o Displays &quot;True&quot; if packets exist in strict
chronological order or &quot;False&quot; if one or more
packets in the capture exists &quot;out-of-order&quot;
time-wise.</p>

<p>-q Quote infos with single quotes (). This option is
only useful when generating a table style report (-T). When
this option is enabled, each value will be encapsulated
within a pair of single quote () characters. This option
(when used with the -m option) is useful for generating one
type of CSV style file report.</p>

<p>-Q Quote infos with double quotes (&quot;). This option
is only useful when generating a table style report (-T).
When this option is enabled, each value will be encapsulated
within a pair of double quote (&quot;) characters. This
option (when used with the -m option) is useful for
generating the most common type of CSV style file
report.</p>

<p>-r Do not generate header record. This option is only
useful when generating a table style report (-T). If this
option is specified then no header record will be generated
within the table report.</p>

<p>-R Generate header record. This option is only useful
when generating a table style report (-T). A header is
generated by default. A header record (if generated) is the
first line of data reported and includes labels for all the
columns included within the table report.</p>

<p>-s Displays the size of the file, in bytes. This reports
the size of the capture file itself.</p>

<p>-S Display the start and end times as seconds since
January 1, 1970. Handy for synchronizing dumps using editcap
-t.</p>

<p>-t Displays the capture type of the capture file.</p>

<p>-T Generate a table report. A table report is a text
file that is suitable for importing into a spreadsheet or
database. Capinfos can build a tab delimited text file (the
default) or several variations on Comma-separated values
(CSV) files.</p>

<p>-u Displays the capture duration, in seconds. This is
the difference in time between the earliest packet seen and
latest packet seen.</p>

<p>-x Displays the average packet rate, in packets/sec</p>

<p>-y Displays the average data rate, in bytes/sec</p>

<p>-z Displays the average packet size, in bytes</p>

<p>EXAMPLES To see a description of the capinfos options
use:</p>

<p>capinfos -h</p>

<p>To generate a long form report for the capture file
mycapture.pcap use:</p>

<p>capinfos mycapture.pcap</p>

<p>To generate a TAB delimited table form report for the
capture file mycapture.pcap use:</p>

<p>capinfos -T mycapture.pcap</p>

<p>To generate a CSV style table form report for the
capture file mycapture.pcap use:</p>

<p>capinfos -T -m -Q mycapture.pcap</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>capinfos -TmQ mycapture.pcap</p>

<p>To generate a TAB delimited table style report with just
the filenames, capture type, capture encapsulation type and
packet count for all the pcap files in the current directory
use:</p>

<p>capinfos -T -t -E -c *.pcap</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>capinfos -TtEs *.pcap</p>

<p>Note: The ability to use of filename globbing characters
are a feature of *nix style command shells.</p>

<p>To generate a CSV delimited table style report of all
infos for all pcap files in the current directory and write
it to a text file called mycaptures.csv use:</p>

<p>capinfos -TmQ *.pcap &gt;mycaptures.csv</p>

<p>The resulting mycaptures.csv file can be easily imported
into spreadsheet applications.</p>
