<p>Name rmiregistry - The Java Remote Object Registry</p>

<p>The rmiregistry command starts a remote object registry
on the spec- ified port on the current host.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rmiregistry [port]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The rmiregistry command creates and starts a
remote object registry on the specified port on the current
host. If port is omitted, the reg- istry is started on port
1099. The rmiregistry command produces no out- put and is
typically run in the background. For example:</p>

<p>rmiregistry &amp;</p>

<p>A remote object registry is a bootstrap naming service
that is used by RMI servers on the same host to bind remote
objects to names. Clients on local and remote hosts can then
look up remote objects and make remote method
invocations.</p>

<p>The registry is typically used to locate the first
remote object on which an application needs to invoke
methods. That object in turn will provide
application-specific support for finding other objects.</p>

<p>The methods of the java.rmi.registry.LocateRegistry
class are used to get a registry operating on the local host
or local host and port.</p>

<p>The URL-based methods of the java.rmi.Naming class
operate on a reg- istry and can be used to look up a remote
object on any host, and on the local host: bind a simple
(string) name to a remote object, rebind a new name to a
remote object (overriding the old binding), unbind a remote
object, and list the URLs bound in the registry.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -J Used in conjunction with any java option, it
passes the option following the -J (no spaces between the -J
and the option) on to the java interpreter.</p>
