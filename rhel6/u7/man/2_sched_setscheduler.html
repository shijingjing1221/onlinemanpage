<p>SCHED_SETSCHEDULER(2) Linux Programmer s Manual
SCHED_SETSCHEDULER(2)</p>

<p>NAME sched_setscheduler, sched_getscheduler - set and
get scheduling pol- icy/parameters</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sched.h&gt;</p>

<p>int sched_setscheduler(pid_t pid, int policy, const
struct sched_param *param);</p>

<p>int sched_getscheduler(pid_t pid);</p>

<p>struct sched_param { ... int sched_priority; ... };</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION sched_setscheduler() sets both the
scheduling policy and the associated parameters for the
process whose ID is specified in pid. If pid equals zero,
the scheduling policy and parameters of the calling process
will be set. The interpretation of the argument param
depends on the selected policy. Currently, Linux supports
the following &quot;normal&quot; (i.e., non-real-time)
scheduling policies:</p>

<p>SCHED_OTHER the standard round-robin time-sharing
policy;</p>

<p>SCHED_BATCH for &quot;batch&quot; style execution of
processes; and</p>

<p>SCHED_IDLE for running very low priority background
jobs.</p>

<p>The following &quot;real-time&quot; policies are also
supported, for special time-critical applications that need
precise control over the way in which runnable processes are
selected for execution:</p>

<p>SCHED_FIFO a first-in, first-out policy; and</p>

<p>SCHED_RR a round-robin policy.</p>

<p>The semantics of each of these policies are detailed
below.</p>

<p>sched_getscheduler() queries the scheduling policy
currently applied to the process identified by pid. If pid
equals zero, the policy of the calling process will be
retrieved.</p>

<p>Scheduling Policies The scheduler is the kernel
component that decides which runnable pro- cess will be
executed by the CPU next. Each process has an associated
scheduling policy and a static scheduling priority,
sched_priority; these are the settings that are modified by
sched_setscheduler(). The scheduler makes it decisions based
on knowledge of the scheduling pol- icy and static priority
of all processes on the system.</p>

<p>For processes scheduled under one of the normal
scheduling policies (SCHED_OTHER, SCHED_IDLE, SCHED_BATCH),
sched_priority is not used in scheduling decisions (it must
be specified as 0).</p>

<p>Processes scheduled under one of the real-time policies
(SCHED_FIFO, SCHED_RR) have a sched_priority value in the
range 1 (low) to 99 (high). (As the numbers imply, real-time
processes always have higher priority than normal
processes.) Note well: POSIX.1-2001 only requires an
implementation to support a minimum 32 distinct priority
levels for the real-time policies, and some systems supply
just this minimum. Portable programs should use
sched_get_priority_min(2) and sched_get_priority_max(2) to
find the range of priorities supported for a particular
policy.</p>

<p>Conceptually, the scheduler maintains a list of runnable
processes for each possible sched_priority value. In order
to determine which pro- cess runs next, the scheduler looks
for the non-empty list with the highest static priority and
selects the process at the head of this list.</p>

<p>A process s scheduling policy determines where it will
be inserted into the list of processes with equal static
priority and how it will move inside this list.</p>

<p>All scheduling is preemptive: if a process with a higher
static prior- ity becomes ready to run, the currently
running process will be pre- empted and returned to the wait
list for its static priority level. The scheduling policy
only determines the ordering within the list of runnable
processes with equal static priority.</p>

<p>SCHED_FIFO: First In-First Out scheduling SCHED_FIFO can
only be used with static priorities higher than 0, which
means that when a SCHED_FIFO processes becomes runnable, it
will always immediately preempt any currently running
SCHED_OTHER, SCHED_BATCH, or SCHED_IDLE process. SCHED_FIFO
is a simple scheduling algorithm with- out time slicing. For
processes scheduled under the SCHED_FIFO policy, the
following rules apply:</p>

<p>* A SCHED_FIFO process that has been preempted by
another process of higher priority will stay at the head of
the list for its priority and will resume execution as soon
as all processes of higher prior- ity are blocked again.</p>

<p>* When a SCHED_FIFO process becomes runnable, it will be
inserted at the end of the list for its priority.</p>

<p>* A call to sched_setscheduler() or sched_setparam(2)
will put the SCHED_FIFO (or SCHED_RR) process identified by
pid at the start of the list if it was runnable. As a
consequence, it may preempt the currently running process if
it has the same priority. (POSIX.1-2001 specifies that the
process should go to the end of the list.)</p>

<p>* A process calling sched_yield(2) will be put at the
end of the list.</p>

<p>No other events will move a process scheduled under the
SCHED_FIFO pol- icy in the wait list of runnable processes
with equal static priority.</p>

<p>A SCHED_FIFO process runs until either it is blocked by
an I/O request, it is preempted by a higher priority
process, or it calls sched_yield(2).</p>

<p>SCHED_RR: Round Robin scheduling SCHED_RR is a simple
enhancement of SCHED_FIFO. Everything described above for
SCHED_FIFO also applies to SCHED_RR, except that each
process is only allowed to run for a maximum time quantum.
If a SCHED_RR pro- cess has been running for a time period
equal to or longer than the time quantum, it will be put at
the end of the list for its priority. A SCHED_RR process
that has been preempted by a higher priority process and
subsequently resumes execution as a running process will
complete the unexpired portion of its round robin time
quantum. The length of the time quantum can be retrieved
using sched_rr_get_interval(2).</p>

<p>SCHED_OTHER: Default Linux time-sharing scheduling
SCHED_OTHER can only be used at static priority 0.
SCHED_OTHER is the standard Linux time-sharing scheduler
that is intended for all processes that do not require the
special real-time mechanisms. The process to run is chosen
from the static priority 0 list based on a dynamic priority
that is determined only inside this list. The dynamic
priority is based on the nice value (set by nice(2) or
setpriority(2)) and increased for each time quantum the
process is ready to run, but denied to run by the scheduler.
This ensures fair progress among all SCHED_OTHER
processes.</p>

<p>SCHED_BATCH: Scheduling batch processes (Since Linux
2.6.16.) SCHED_BATCH can only be used at static priority 0.
This policy is similar to SCHED_OTHER in that it schedules
the pro- cess according to its dynamic priority (based on
the nice value). The difference is that this policy will
cause the scheduler to always assume that the process is
CPU-intensive. Consequently, the scheduler will apply a
small scheduling penalty with respect to wakeup behaviour,
so that this process is mildly disfavored in scheduling
decisions.</p>

<p>This policy is useful for workloads that are
non-interactive, but do not want to lower their nice value,
and for workloads that want a deterministic scheduling
policy without interactivity causing extra preemptions
(between the workloads tasks).</p>

<p>SCHED_IDLE: Scheduling very low priority jobs (Since
Linux 2.6.23.) SCHED_IDLE can only be used at static
priority 0; the process nice value has no influence for this
policy.</p>

<p>This policy is intended for running jobs at extremely
low priority (lower even than a +19 nice value with the
SCHED_OTHER or SCHED_BATCH policies).</p>

<p>Privileges and resource limits In Linux kernels before
2.6.12, only privileged (CAP_SYS_NICE) pro- cesses can set a
non-zero static priority (i.e., set a real-time scheduling
policy). The only change that an unprivileged process can
make is to set the SCHED_OTHER policy, and this can only be
done if the effective user ID of the caller of
sched_setscheduler() matches the real or effective user ID
of the target process (i.e., the process specified by pid)
whose policy is being changed.</p>

<p>Since Linux 2.6.12, the RLIMIT_RTPRIO resource limit
defines a ceiling on an unprivileged processs static
priority for the SCHED_RR and SCHED_FIFO policies. The rules
for changing scheduling policy and pri- ority are as
follows:</p>

<p>* If an unprivileged process has a non-zero
RLIMIT_RTPRIO soft limit, then it can change its scheduling
policy and priority, subject to the restriction that the
priority cannot be set to a value higher than the maximum of
its current priority and its RLIMIT_RTPRIO soft limit.</p>

<p>* If the RLIMIT_RTPRIO soft limit is 0, then the only
permitted changes are to lower the priority, or to switch to
a non-real-time policy.</p>

<p>* Subject to the same rules, another unprivileged
process can also make these changes, as long as the
effective user ID of the process making the change matches
the real or effective user ID of the target pro- cess.</p>

<p>* Special rules apply for the SCHED_IDLE: an
unprivileged process oper- ating under this policy cannot
change its policy, regardless of the value of its
RLIMIT_RTPRIO resource limit.</p>

<p>Privileged (CAP_SYS_NICE) processes ignore the
RLIMIT_RTPRIO limit; as with older kernels, they can make
arbitrary changes to scheduling pol- icy and priority. See
getrlimit(2) for further information on RLIMIT_RTPRIO.</p>

<p>Response time A blocked high priority process waiting
for the I/O has a certain response time before it is
scheduled again. The device driver writer can greatly reduce
this response time by using a &quot;slow interrupt&quot;
interrupt handler.</p>

<p>Miscellaneous Child processes inherit the scheduling
policy and parameters across a fork(2). The scheduling
policy and parameters are preserved across execve(2).</p>

<p>Memory locking is usually needed for real-time processes
to avoid pag- ing delays; this can be done with mlock(2) or
mlockall(2).</p>

<p>Since a non-blocking infinite loop in a process
scheduled under SCHED_FIFO or SCHED_RR will block all
processes with lower priority forever, a software developer
should always keep available on the con- sole a shell
scheduled under a higher static priority than the tested
application. This will allow an emergency kill of tested
real-time applications that do not block or terminate as
expected. See also the description of the RLIMIT_RTTIME
resource limit in getrlimit(2).</p>

<p>POSIX systems on which sched_setscheduler() and
sched_getscheduler() are available define
_POSIX_PRIORITY_SCHEDULING in &lt;unistd.h&gt;.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, sched_setscheduler() returns
zero. On success, sched_getscheduler() returns the policy
for the process (a non-negative integer). On error, -1 is
returned, and errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS EINVAL The scheduling policy is not one of the
recognized policies, or param does not make sense for the
policy.</p>

<p>EPERM The calling process does not have appropriate
privileges.</p>

<p>ESRCH The process whose ID is pid could not be
found.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO POSIX.1-2001 (but see BUGS below). The
SCHED_BATCH and SCHED_IDLE policies are Linux-specific.</p>

<p>NOTES POSIX.1 does not detail the permissions that an
unprivileged process requires in order to call
sched_setscheduler(), and details vary across systems. For
example, the Solaris 7 manual page says that the real or
effective user ID of the calling process must match the real
user ID or the save set-user-ID of the target process.</p>

<p>Originally, Standard Linux was intended as a
general-purpose operating system being able to handle
background processes, interactive applica- tions, and less
demanding real-time applications (applications that need to
usually meet timing deadlines). Although the Linux kernel
2.6 allowed for kernel preemption and the newly introduced
O(1) scheduler ensures that the time needed to schedule is
fixed and deterministic irrespective of the number of active
tasks, true real-time computing was not possible up to
kernel version 2.6.17.</p>

<p>Real-time features in the mainline Linux kernel From
kernel version 2.6.18 onwards, however, Linux is gradually
becom- ing equipped with real-time capabilities, most of
which are derived from the former realtime-preempt patches
developed by Ingo Molnar, Thomas Gleixner, Steven Rostedt,
and others. Until the patches have been completely merged
into the mainline kernel (this is expected to be around
kernel version 2.6.30), they must be installed to achieve
the best real-time performance. These patches are named:</p>

<p>patch-kernelversion-rtpatchversion</p>

<p>and can be downloaded from
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/ker- nel/projects/rt/.</p>

<p>Without the patches and prior to their full inclusion
into the mainline kernel, the kernel configuration offers
only the three preemption classes CONFIG_PREEMPT_NONE,
CONFIG_PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY, and CONFIG_PRE- EMPT_DESKTOP which
respectively provide no, some, and considerable reduction of
the worst-case scheduling latency.</p>

<p>With the patches applied or after their full inclusion
into the main- line kernel, the additional configuration
item CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT becomes available. If this is
selected, Linux is transformed into a regular real-time
operating system. The FIFO and RR scheduling poli- cies that
can be selected using sched_setscheduler() are then used to
run a process with true real-time priority and a minimum
worst-case scheduling latency.</p>

<p>BUGS POSIX says that on success, sched_setscheduler()
should return the pre- vious scheduling policy. Linux
sched_setscheduler() does not conform to this requirement,
since it always returns 0 on success.</p>
