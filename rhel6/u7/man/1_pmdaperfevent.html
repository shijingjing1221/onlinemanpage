<p>PMDAPERFEVENT(1) PMDAPERFEVENT(1)</p>

<p>NAME pmdaperfevent - hardware performance counter
performance metrics domain agent (PMDA)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/perfevent/pmdaperfevent [-d
domain] [-l logfile] [-U username] [-i port] [-p] [-u
socket] [-6]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pmdaperfevent is a Performance Metrics
Domain Agent (PMDA) that config- ures and reads the hardware
performance counters using the Linux kernel perf_event
API.</p>

<p>The perfevent PMDA exports metrics for hardware
performance counters that are configurable from the Linux
kernel perf_event API. The PMDA uses the libpfm4 library to
access the hardware performance counters so any counters
that are supported in libpfm4 should be available. Also
included is the ability to read the Intel RAPL counters via
direct MSR access. The PMDA supports automatically loading
different counters for each hardware architecture. A single
configuration file is used to specify the desired counters
for each hardware performance monitoring unit (PMU). The
configuration file allows different counters to be pro-
grammed on different CPUs and supports round-robin
assignment of uncore counters needed for some AMD chips.</p>

<p>The PMDA configures the counters to count events in both
user and ker- nel mode. This means that the hardware
counters are unavailable to use by normal unprivileged user
applications when they are in use by the PMDA. The PMDA
provides a mechanism to temporarily disable the system- wide
counters in order to allow normal users to be able to use
the counters if they wish. See perfalloc(1) for details.</p>

<p>A brief description of the pmdaperfevent command line
options follows:</p>

<p>-d It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics
domain num- ber specified here is unique and consistent.
That is, domain should be different for every PMDA on the
one host, and the same domain number should be used for the
same PMDA on all hosts.</p>

<p>-l Location of the log file. By default, a log file
named per- fevent.log is written in the current directory of
pmcd(1) when pmdaperfevent is started, i.e.
$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd. If the log file cannot be created or is
not writable, output is written to the standard error
instead.</p>

<p>-U User account under which to run the agent. The
default is the privileged &quot;root&quot; account.</p>

<p>-i listen on given port number for connection from
pmcd(1)</p>

<p>-p communicate with pmcd(1) via stdin/stdout</p>

<p>-u expect pmcd(1) to connect on given unix domain
socket</p>

<p>-6 expect pmcd(1) to connect on given ipv6 port (number
or name)</p>

<p>INSTALLATION The perfevent PMDA is not activated by
default. To install the PMDA, do the following as root:</p>

<p># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/perfevent # ./Install</p>

<p>If you want to undo the installation, do the following
as root:</p>

<p># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/perfevent # ./Remove</p>

<p>pmdaperfevent is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be
executed directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify
pmcd(1) when the agent is installed or removed.</p>

<p>FILES $PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH command line options used to
launch pmdaperfevent $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/perfevent/perfevent.conf
default configuration file for the PMDA. See per-
fevent.conf(3) for detailed information.
$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/perfevent/help default help text file for the
perfevent metrics $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/perfevent/Install
installation script for the pmdaperfevent agent
$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/perfevent/Remove undo installation script for
the pmdaperfevent agent $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/perfevent.log
default log file for error messages and other information
from pmdaperfevent</p>

<p>BUGS Each event is placed in its own group and there is
no way to group related events together so they are
guaranteed to be simultaneously active. A workaround for
this is to ensure that the number of config- ured events is
less than or equal to the number of available hardware
counters. This means that the events will not be
time-multiplexed by the kernel and will be simultaneously
active.</p>

<p>PCP ENVIRONMENT Environment variables with the prefix
PCP_ are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP. On each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in pcp.conf(5).</p>
