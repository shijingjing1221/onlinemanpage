<p>SHM_UNLINK(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
SHM_UNLINK(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME shm_unlink - remove a shared memory object
(REALTIME)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/mman.h&gt;</p>

<p>int shm_unlink(const char *name);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The shm_unlink() function shall remove the
name of the shared memory object named by the string pointed
to by name.</p>

<p>If one or more references to the shared memory object
exist when the object is unlinked, the name shall be removed
before shm_unlink() returns, but the removal of the memory
object contents shall be post- poned until all open and map
references to the shared memory object have been
removed.</p>

<p>Even if the object continues to exist after the last
shm_unlink(), reuse of the name shall subsequently cause
shm_open() to behave as if no shared memory object of this
name exists (that is, shm_open() will fail if O_CREAT is not
set, or will create a new shared memory object if O_CREAT is
set).</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, a value of zero
shall be returned. Other- wise, a value of -1 shall be
returned and errno set to indicate the error. If -1 is
returned, the named shared memory object shall not be
changed by this function call.</p>

<p>ERRORS The shm_unlink() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EACCES Permission is denied to unlink the named shared
memory object.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG The length of the name argument exceeds
{PATH_MAX} or a pathname component is longer than
{NAME_MAX}.</p>

<p>ENOENT The named shared memory object does not
exist.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE Names of memory objects that were
allocated with open() are deleted with unlink() in the usual
fashion. Names of memory objects that were allocated with
shm_open() are deleted with shm_unlink(). Note that the
actual memory object is not destroyed until the last close
and unmap on it have occurred if it was already in use.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
