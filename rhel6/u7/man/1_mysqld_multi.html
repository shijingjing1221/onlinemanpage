<p>NAME mysqld_multi - manage multiple MySQL servers</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS mysqld_multi [options] {start|stop|report}
[GNR[,GNR] ...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION mysqld_multi is designed to manage several
mysqld processes that listen for connections on different
Unix socket files and TCP/IP ports. It can start or stop
servers, or report their current status. The MySQL Instance
Manager is an alternative means of managing multiple servers
(see mysqlmanager(8)).</p>

<p>mysqld_multi searches for groups named [mysqldN] in
my.cnf (or in the file named by the --config-file option). N
can be any positive integer. This number is referred to in
the following discussion as the option group number, or GNR.
Group numbers distinguish option groups from one another and
are used as arguments to mysqld_multi to specify which
servers you want to start, stop, or obtain a status report
for. Options listed in these groups are the same that you
would use in the [mysqld] group used for starting mysqld.
(See, for example, Section 2.12.1.2, Starting and Stopping
MySQL Automatically.) However, when using multiple servers,
it is necessary that each one use its own value for options
such as the Unix socket file and TCP/IP port number. For
more information on which options must be unique per server
in a multiple-server environment, see Section 5.3, Running
Multiple MySQL Instances on One Machine.</p>

<p>To invoke mysqld_multi, use the following syntax:</p>

<p>shell&gt; mysqld_multi [options] {start|stop|report}
[GNR[,GNR] ...]</p>

<p>start, stop, and report indicate which operation to
perform. You can perform the designated operation for a
single server or multiple servers, depending on the GNR list
that follows the option name. If there is no list,
mysqld_multi performs the operation for all servers in the
option file.</p>

<p>Each GNR value represents an option group number or
range of group numbers. The value should be the number at
the end of the group name in the option file. For example,
the GNR for a group named [mysqld17] is 17. To specify a
range of numbers, separate the first and last numbers by a
dash. The GNR value 10-13 represents groups [mysqld10]
through [mysqld13]. Multiple groups or group ranges can be
specified on the command line, separated by commas. There
must be no whitespace characters (spaces or tabs) in the GNR
list; anything after a whitespace character is ignored.</p>

<p>This command starts a single server using option group
[mysqld17]:</p>

<p>shell&gt; mysqld_multi start 17</p>

<p>This command stops several servers, using option groups
[mysqld8] and [mysqld10] through [mysqld13]:</p>

<p>shell&gt; mysqld_multi stop 8,10-13</p>

<p>For an example of how you might set up an option file,
use this command:</p>

<p>shell&gt; mysqld_multi --example</p>

<p>As of MySQL 5.1.18, mysqld_multi searches for option
files as follows:</p>

<p>&middot; With --no-defaults, no option files are
read.</p>

<p>&middot; With --defaults-file=file_name, only the named
file is read.</p>

<p>&middot; Otherwise, option files in the standard list of
locations are read, including any file named by the
--defaults-extra-file=file_name option, if one is given. (If
the option is given multiple times, the last value is
used.)</p>

<p>Before MySQL 5.1.18, the preceding options are not
recognized. Files in the standard locations are read, and
any file named by the --config-file=file_name option, if one
is given. A file named by --config-file is read only for
[mysqldN] option groups, not the [mysqld_multi] group.</p>

<p>Option files read are searched for [mysqld_multi] and
[mysqldN] option groups. The [mysqld_multi] group can be
used for options to mysqld_multi itself. [mysqldN] groups
can be used for options passed to specific mysqld
instances.</p>

<p>As of MySQL 5.1.35, the [mysqld] or [mysqld_safe] groups
can be used for common options read by all instances of
mysqld or mysqld_safe. You can specify a
--defaults-file=file_name option to use a different
configuration file for that instance, in which case the
[mysqld] or [mysqld_safe] groups from that file will be used
for that instance. Before MySQL 5.1.35, some versions of
mysqld_multi pass the --no-defaults options to instances, so
these techniques are inapplicable.</p>

<p>mysqld_multi supports the following options.</p>

<p>&middot; --help</p>

<p>Display a help message and exit.</p>

<p>&middot; --config-file=file_name</p>

<p>As of MySQL 5.1.18, this option is deprecated. If given,
it is treated the same way as --defaults-extra-file,
described earlier. --config-file is removed in MySQL
5.5.</p>

<p>Before MySQL 5.1.18, this option specifies the name of
an extra option file. It affects where mysqld_multi looks
for [mysqldN] option groups. Without this option, all
options are read from the usual my.cnf file. The option does
not affect where mysqld_multi reads its own options, which
are always taken from the [mysqld_multi] group in the usual
my.cnf file.</p>

<p>&middot; --example</p>

<p>Display a sample option file.</p>

<p>&middot; --log=file_name</p>

<p>Specify the name of the log file. If the file exists,
log output is appended to it.</p>

<p>&middot; --mysqladmin=prog_name</p>

<p>The mysqladmin binary to be used to stop servers.</p>

<p>&middot; --mysqld=prog_name</p>

<p>The mysqld binary to be used. Note that you can specify
mysqld_safe as the value for this option also. If you use
mysqld_safe to start the server, you can include the mysqld
or ledir options in the corresponding [mysqldN] option
group. These options indicate the name of the server that
mysqld_safe should start and the path name of the directory
where the server is located. (See the descriptions for these
options in mysqld_safe(1).) Example:</p>

<p>[mysqld38] mysqld = mysqld-debug ledir =
/opt/local/mysql/libexec</p>

<p>&middot; --no-log</p>

<p>Print log information to stdout rather than to the log
file. By default, output goes to the log file.</p>

<p>&middot; --password=password</p>

<p>The password of the MySQL account to use when invoking
mysqladmin. Note that the password value is not optional for
this option, unlike for other MySQL programs.</p>

<p>&middot; --silent</p>

<p>Silent mode; disable warnings.</p>

<p>&middot; --tcp-ip</p>

<p>Connect to each MySQL server through the TCP/IP port
instead of the Unix socket file. (If a socket file is
missing, the server might still be running, but accessible
only through the TCP/IP port.) By default, connections are
made using the Unix socket file. This option affects stop
and report operations.</p>

<p>&middot; --user=user_name</p>

<p>The user name of the MySQL account to use when invoking
mysqladmin.</p>

<p>&middot; --verbose</p>

<p>Be more verbose.</p>

<p>&middot; --version</p>

<p>Display version information and exit.</p>

<p>Some notes about mysqld_multi:</p>

<p>&middot; Most important: Before using mysqld_multi be
sure that you understand the meanings of the options that
are passed to the mysqld servers and why you would want to
have separate mysqld processes. Beware of the dangers of
using multiple mysqld servers with the same data directory.
Use separate data directories, unless you know what you are
doing. Starting multiple servers with the same data
directory does not give you extra performance in a threaded
system. See Section 5.3, Running Multiple MySQL Instances on
One Machine.</p>

<p>&middot;</p>

<p>Important Make sure that the data directory for each
server is fully accessible to the Unix account that the
specific mysqld process is started as. Do not use the Unix
root account for this, unless you know what you are doing.
See Section 6.1.5, How to Run MySQL as a Normal User.</p>

<p>&middot; Make sure that the MySQL account used for
stopping the mysqld servers (with the mysqladmin program)
has the same user name and password for each server. Also,
make sure that the account has the SHUTDOWN privilege. If
the servers that you want to manage have different user
names or passwords for the administrative accounts, you
might want to create an account on each server that has the
same user name and password. For example, you might set up a
common multi_admin account by executing the following
commands for each server:</p>

<p>shell&gt; mysql -u root -S /tmp/mysql.sock -p Enter
password: mysql&gt; GRANT SHUTDOWN ON *.* -&gt; TO
&rsquo;multi_admin&rsquo;@&rsquo;localhost&rsquo; IDENTIFIED
BY &rsquo;multipass&rsquo;;</p>

<p>See Section 6.2, The MySQL Access Privilege System . You
have to do this for each mysqld server. Change the
connection parameters appropriately when connecting to each
one. Note that the host name part of the account name must
permit you to connect as multi_admin from the host where you
want to run mysqld_multi.</p>

<p>&middot; The Unix socket file and the TCP/IP port number
must be different for every mysqld. (Alternatively, if the
host has multiple network addresses, you can use
--bind-address to cause different servers to listen to
different interfaces.)</p>

<p>&middot; The --pid-file option is very important if you
are using mysqld_safe to start mysqld (for example,
--mysqld=mysqld_safe) Every mysqld should have its own
process ID file. The advantage of using mysqld_safe instead
of mysqld is that mysqld_safe monitors its mysqld process
and restarts it if the process terminates due to a signal
sent using kill -9 or for other reasons, such as a
segmentation fault. Please note that the mysqld_safe script
might require that you start it from a certain place. This
means that you might have to change location to a certain
directory before running mysqld_multi. If you have problems
starting, please see the mysqld_safe script. Check
especially the lines:</p>


<p>----------------------------------------------------------------
MY_PWD=pwd # Check if we are starting this relative (for the
binary release) if test -d $MY_PWD/data/mysql -a -f
./share/mysql/english/errmsg.sys -a -x ./bin/mysqld
----------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<p>The test performed by these lines should be successful,
or you might encounter problems. See mysqld_safe(1).</p>

<p>&middot; You might want to use the --user option for
mysqld, but to do this you need to run the mysqld_multi
script as the Unix superuser (root). Having the option in
the option file doesn&rsquo;t matter; you just get a warning
if you are not the superuser and the mysqld processes are
started under your own Unix account.</p>

<p>The following example shows how you might set up an
option file for use with mysqld_multi. The order in which
the mysqld programs are started or stopped depends on the
order in which they appear in the option file. Group numbers
need not form an unbroken sequence. The first and fifth
[mysqldN] groups were intentionally omitted from the example
to illustrate that you can have gaps in the option file.
This gives you more flexibility.</p>
