<p>SM-NOTIFY(8) SM-NOTIFY(8)</p>

<p>NAME sm-notify - send reboot notifications to NFS
peers</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS /usr/sbin/sm-notify [-dfn] [-m minutes] [-v
name] [-p notify-port] [-P path]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION File locks are not part of persistent file
system state. Lock state is thus lost when a host
reboots.</p>

<p>Network file systems must also detect when lock state is
lost because a remote host has rebooted. After an NFS client
reboots, an NFS server must release all file locks held by
applications that were running on that client. After a
server reboots, a client must remind the server of file
locks held by applications running on that client.</p>

<p>For NFS version 2 and version 3, the Network Status
Monitor protocol (or NSM for short) is used to notify NFS
peers of reboots. On Linux, two separate user-space
components constitute the NSM service:</p>

<p>sm-notify A helper program that notifies NFS peers after
the local system reboots</p>

<p>rpc.statd A daemon that listens for reboot notifications
from other hosts, and manages the list of hosts to be
notified when the local sys- tem reboots</p>

<p>The local NFS lock manager alerts its local rpc.statd of
each remote peer that should be monitored. When the local
system reboots, the sm- notify command notifies the NSM
service on monitored peers of the reboot. When a remote
reboots, that peer notifies the local rpc.statd, which in
turn passes the reboot notification back to the local NFS
lock manager.</p>

<p>NSM OPERATION IN DETAIL The first file locking
interaction between an NFS client and server causes the NFS
lock managers on both peers to contact their local NSM
service to store information about the opposite peer. On
Linux, the local lock manager contacts rpc.statd.</p>

<p>rpc.statd records information about each monitored NFS
peer on persis- tent storage. This information describes how
to contact a remote peer in case the local system reboots,
how to recognize which monitored peer is reporting a reboot,
and how to notify the local lock manager when a monitored
peer indicates it has rebooted.</p>

<p>An NFS client sends a hostname, known as the clients
caller_name, in each file lock request. An NFS server can
use this hostname to send asynchronous GRANT calls to a
client, or to notify the client it has rebooted.</p>

<p>The Linux NFS server can provide the client s
caller_name or the client s network address to rpc.statd.
For the purposes of the NSM protocol, this name or address
is known as the monitored peers mon_name. In addition, the
local lock manager tells rpc.statd what it thinks its own
hostname is. For the purposes of the NSM protocol, this
hostname is known as my_name.</p>

<p>There is no equivalent interaction between an NFS server
and a client to inform the client of the server s
caller_name. Therefore NFS clients do not actually know what
mon_name an NFS server might use in an SM_NOTIFY request.
The Linux NFS client records the servers host- name used on
the mount command to identify rebooting NFS servers.</p>

<p>Reboot notification When the local system reboots, the
sm-notify command reads the list of monitored peers from
persistent storage and sends an SM_NOTIFY request to the NSM
service on each listed remote peer. It uses the mon_name
string as the destination. To identify which host has
rebooted, the sm-notify command normally sends my_name
string recorded when that remote was monitored. The remote
rpc.statd matches incoming SM_NOTIFY requests using this
string, or the caller s network address, to one or more
peers on its own monitor list.</p>

<p>If rpc.statd does not find a peer on its monitor list
that matches an incoming SM_NOTIFY request, the notification
is not forwarded to the local lock manager. In addition,
each peer has its own NSM state num- ber, a 32-bit integer
that is bumped after each reboot by the sm-notify command.
rpc.statd uses this number to distinguish between actual
reboots and replayed notifications.</p>

<p>Part of NFS lock recovery is rediscovering which peers
need to be moni- tored again. The sm-notify command clears
the monitor list on persis- tent storage after each
reboot.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -d Keeps sm-notify attached to its controlling
terminal and running in the foreground so that notification
progress may be monitored directly.</p>

<p>-f Send notifications even if sm-notify has already run
since the last system reboot.</p>

<p>-m retry-time Specifies the length of time, in minutes,
to continue retrying notifications to unresponsive hosts. If
this option is not specified, sm-notify attempts to send
notifications for 15 min- utes. Specifying a value of 0
causes sm-notify to continue sending notifications to
unresponsive peers until it is manually killed.</p>

<p>Notifications are retried if sending fails, the remote
does not respond, the remotes NSM service is not registered,
or if there is a DNS failure which prevents the remote s
mon_name from being resolved to an address.</p>

<p>Hosts are not removed from the notification list until a
valid reply has been received. However, the SM_NOTIFY
procedure has a void result. There is no way for sm-notify
to tell if the remote recognized the sender and has started
appropriate lock recovery.</p>

<p>-n Prevents sm-notify from updating the local systems
NSM state number.</p>

<p>-p port Specifies the source port number sm-notify
should use when send- ing reboot notifications. If this
option is not specified, a randomly chosen ephemeral port is
used.</p>

<p>This option can be used to traverse a firewall between
client and server.</p>

<p>-P, --state-directory-path pathname Specifies the
pathname of the parent directory where NSM state information
resides. If this option is not specified, sm-notify uses
/var/lib/nfs/statd by default.</p>

<p>After starting, sm-notify attempts to set its effective
UID and GID to the owner and group of this directory.</p>

<p>-v ipaddr | hostname Specifies the network address from
which to send reboot notifi- cations, and the mon_name
argument to use when sending SM_NOTIFY requests. If this
option is not specified, sm-notify uses a wildcard address
as the transport bind address, and uses the my_name recorded
when the remote was monitored as the mon_name argument when
sending SM_NOTIFY requests.</p>

<p>The ipaddr form can be expressed as either an IPv4 or an
IPv6 presentation address. If the ipaddr form is used, the
sm-notify command converts this address to a hostname for
use as the mon_name argument when sending SM_NOTIFY
requests.</p>

<p>This option can be useful in multi-homed configurations
where the remote requires notification from a specific
network address.</p>

<p>SECURITY The sm-notify command must be started as root
to acquire privileges needed to access the state information
database. It drops root privi- leges as soon as it starts up
to reduce the risk of a privilege escala- tion attack.</p>

<p>During normal operation, the effective user ID it
chooses is the owner of the state directory. This allows it
to continue to access files in that directory after it has
dropped its root privileges. To control which user ID
rpc.statd chooses, simply use chown(1) to set the owner of
the state directory.</p>

<p>ADDITIONAL NOTES Lock recovery after a reboot is
critical to maintaining data integrity and preventing
unnecessary application hangs.</p>

<p>To help rpc.statd match SM_NOTIFY requests to NLM
requests, a number of best practices should be observed,
including:</p>

<p>The UTS nodename of your systems should match the DNS
names that NFS peers use to contact them</p>

<p>The UTS nodenames of your systems should always be fully
quali- fied domain names</p>

<p>The forward and reverse DNS mapping of the UTS nodenames
should be consistent</p>

<p>The hostname the client uses to mount the server should
match the servers mon_name in SM_NOTIFY requests it
sends</p>

<p>Unmounting an NFS file system does not necessarily stop
either the NFS client or server from monitoring each other.
Both may continue moni- toring each other for a time in case
subsequent NFS traffic between the two results in fresh
mounts and additional file locking.</p>

<p>On Linux, if the lockd kernel module is unloaded during
normal opera- tion, all remote NFS peers are unmonitored.
This can happen on an NFS client, for example, if an
automounter removes all NFS mount points due to
inactivity.</p>

<p>IPv6 and TI-RPC support TI-RPC is a pre-requisite for
supporting NFS on IPv6. If TI-RPC sup- port is built into
the sm-notify command ,it will choose an appropriate IPv4 or
IPv6 transport based on the network address returned by DNS
for each remote peer. It should be fully compatible with
remote systems that do not support TI-RPC or IPv6.</p>

<p>Currently, the sm-notify command supports sending
notification only via datagram transport protocols.</p>
