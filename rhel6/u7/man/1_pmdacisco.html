<p>NAME pmdacisco - Cisco router performance metrics domain
agent (PMDA)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/cisco/pmdacisco [-d domain] [-l
logfile] [-U username] [-P password] [-r refresh] [-s
prompt] [-M username] [-x port] host:interface-spec [...]
$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/cisco/parse [options] host:interface-spec
[...] $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/cisco/probe [-P password] [-s prompt]
[-U username] [-x port] host</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pmdacisco is a Performance Metrics Domain
Agent (PMDA) which extracts performance metrics from one or
more Cisco routers.</p>

<p>A brief description of the pmdacisco command line
options follows:</p>

<p>-d It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics
domain num- ber specified here is unique and consistent.
That is, domain should be different for every PMDA on the
one host, and the same domain number should be used for the
same PMDA on all hosts.</p>

<p>-l Location of the log file. By default, a log file
named cisco.log is written in the current directory of
pmcd(1) when pmdacisco is started, i.e. $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd.
If the log file cannot be cre- ated or is not writable,
output is written to the standard error instead.</p>

<p>-P By default, it is assumed that no user-level password
is required to access the Ciscos telnet port. If user-level
passwords have been enabled on the Ciscos, then those
passwords must be specified to pmdacisco. If specified with
the -P option, password will be used as the default
user-level password for all Ciscos. See also the INTERFACE
IDENTIFICATION section below.</p>

<p>-r pmdacisco will refresh the current values for all
performance met- rics by contacting each Cisco router once
every refresh seconds. The default refresh is 120
seconds.</p>

<p>-s The Cisco command prompt ends with the string prompt.
The default value is &gt;. The only way pmdacisco can
synchronize the send- ing of commands and the parsing of
output is by recognizing prompt as a unique string that
comes at the end of all output, i.e. as the command prompt
when waiting for the next command.</p>

<p>-U By default, it is assumed that no username login is
required to access the Cisco s telnet port. If username
login has been enabled on the Ciscos, then the corresponding
usernames must be specified to pmdacisco. If specified with
the -U option, username will be used as the default username
login for all Ciscos. See also the INTERFACE IDENTIFICATION
section below.</p>

<p>-M User account under which to run the agent. The
default is the unprivileged &quot;pcp&quot; account in
current versions of PCP, but in older versions the superuser
account (&quot;root&quot;) was used by default.</p>

<p>-x Connect to the Cisco via TCP port number port rather
than the default 23 for a telnet connection.</p>

<p>For each interface, once the telnet connection is
established, pmdacisco is willing to wait up to 5 seconds
for the Cisco to provide a new snapshot of the requested
information. If this does not happen, the telnet connection
is broken and no values are returned. This pre- vents
pmdacisco tying up the Ciscos telnet ports waiting
indefinitely when the response from the router is not what
is expected, e.g. if the format of the show int output
changes, or the command is in error because an interface is
no longer configured on the router.</p>

<p>INTERFACE IDENTIFICATION As each Cisco router can
support multiple network interfaces and/or multiple
communications protocols, it is necessary to tell pmdacisco
which interfaces are to be monitored.</p>

<p>The host:interface-spec arguments on the command line
define a particu- lar interface on a particular Cisco
router. host should be a hostname or a dot-notation IP
address that identifies the telnet port of a particular
Cisco router. There are several components of the inter-
face-spec as follows.</p>

<p>protocol One of the abbreviations a, B, E, e, f, G, h, s
or Vl respec- tively for ATM, BRI (ISDN), FastEthernet,
Ethernet, FDDI, Giga- bitEthernet, HSSI, serial or Vlan.</p>

<p>interface Depending on the model of the Cisco, this will
either be an integer, e.g. s0, or an integer followed by a
slash (/) fol- lowed by a subinterface identification in one
of a variety of syntactic forms, e.g. e1/0, G0/0/1 or
s4/2.1.</p>

<p>To discover the valid interfaces on a particular Cisco,
connect to the telnet port (using telnet(1)) and enter the
command &quot;show int&quot; and look for the interface
identifiers following the key- words Ethernet, Fddi, Serial,
etc.</p>

<p>Alternatively run the probe command.</p>

<p>username If there is a username login, and it is
different to the default (see -U above), it may be
optionally specified here by appending @ and the username to
the end of interface-spec.</p>

<p>password If there is a user-level password, and it is
different to the default (see -P above), it may be
optionally specified here by appending a question mark (?)
and the password to the end of interface-spec.</p>

<p>prompt If the Cisco command prompt is different to the
default (see -s above), it may be optionally specified here
by appending an exclamation mark (!) and the prompt to the
end of interface- spec.</p>

<p>The following are examples of valid interface-spec
arguments. my-router:e1/2 123.456.789.0:s0
wancisco:f2/3?trust_me somecisco:G1/0!myprompt
cisco34.foo.bar.com:e2?way2cool mycisco:s2/2.1@mylogin
yourcisco:E0/0@yourlogin?yourpassword
mycisco:E0/0@mylogin?mypassword!myprompt</p>

<p>HELPER UTILITIES The probe command may be used to
discover the names of all interfaces for a particular Cisco
router identified by host. The -P argument is the same as
for pmdacisco.</p>

<p>The parse command takes exactly the same arguments as
pmdacisco, but executes outside the control of any pmcd(1)
and so may be used to diag- nose problems with handling a
particular Cisco router and/or one of its interfaces.</p>

<p>Additional diagnostic verbosity may be produced using
the -D appl0,appl1,appl2 command line option. appl0 logs
connect and discon- nect events, login progress, high-level
flow of control and extracted statistics. appl1 traces all
commands sent to the Cisco device. appl2 logs tokenizing and
parsing of the output from the Cisco device. Diag- nostics
are generated on standard error as each sample is fetched
and parsed.</p>

<p>INSTALLATION If you want access to the names, help text
and values for the Cisco performance metrics, do the
following as root:</p>

<p># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/cisco # ./Install</p>

<p>If you want to undo the installation, do the following
as root:</p>

<p># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/cisco # ./Remove</p>

<p>pmdacisco is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be
executed directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify
pmcd(1) when the agent is installed or removed.</p>

<p>FILES $PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH command line options used to
launch pmdacisco $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/cisco/help default help text
file for the Cisco metrics $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/cisco/Install
installation script for the pmdacisco agent
$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/cisco/Remove undo installation script for the
pmdacisco agent $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/cisco.log default log file
for error messages and other information from pmdacisco</p>

<p>PCP ENVIRONMENT Environment variables with the prefix
PCP_ are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP. On each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in pcp.conf(5).</p>
