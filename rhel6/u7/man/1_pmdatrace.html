<p>PMDATRACE(1) PMDATRACE(1)</p>

<p>NAME pmdatrace - application-level transaction
performance metrics domain agent</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/trace/pmdatrace [-d domain] [-l
logfile] [-A access] [-I port] [-M username] [-N buckets]
[-T period] [-U units]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pmdatrace is a Performance Metrics Domain
Agent (PMDA) which exports transaction performance metrics
from application processes which use the pcp_trace library
described in pmdatrace(3).</p>

<p>A brief description of the pmdatrace command line
options follows:</p>

<p>-d It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics
domain num- ber specified here is unique and consistent.
That is, domain should be different for every PMDA on the
one host, and the same domain number should be used for the
same PMDA on all hosts.</p>

<p>-l Location of the log file. By default, a log file
named trace.log is written in the current directory of
pmcd(1) when pmdatrace is started, i.e. $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd.
If the log file cannot be cre- ated or is not writable,
output is written to the standard error instead.</p>

<p>-A Host-based access control for pmdatrace. access must
be either an allow or deny specification, using either
allow:hostspec:maxconns or disallow:hostspec, where allow
and disallow are keywords, hostspec is a host specification
conforming to the format used by both pmcd(1) and
pmlogger(1), and maxconns is the maximum number of
connections allowed from a given hostspec. Using a maximum
connections of zero specifies an unlimited number of con-
nections for the accompanying hostspec.</p>

<p>-I Communicate with pcp_trace clients via the given
Internet port. This can alternatively be specified by
setting $PCP_TRACE_PORT in the environment to some valid
port number (use of the -I option overrides this). The
default port number is 4323.</p>

<p>-T period defines the aggregation period used to compute
the recent averages and extrema. Specified as a time
interval using the syn- tax described in PCPIntro(1) for the
common -t PCP argument, e.g. 30 seconds or 1 min. The
default is 60 seconds.</p>

<p>-M User account under which to run the agent. The
default is the unprivileged &quot;pcp&quot; account in
current versions of PCP, but in older versions the superuser
account (&quot;root&quot;) was used by default.</p>

<p>-N Internally, the aggregation period is divided into
bucket divi- sions, and the rolling average is recomputed
every period/bucket seconds. For example, the defaults
correspond to -T 60 and -N 12, which means the average is
recomputed every five seconds for a period covering the
prior 60 seconds.</p>

<p>-U This option allows the dimension and scale associated
with the observation value metric to be configured. units is
a comma-sepa- rated string of six integer values, which are
the space dimension, time dimension, count dimension, space
scale, time scale, and count scale, respectively. The
default dimension and scale is none, which is equivalent to
presenting 0,0,0,0,0,0 as the argument to -U. The units
associated with a metric are most easily viewed using the -d
(metric description) option to pminfo(1). The Install script
described below steps through this option quite explicitly,
so it is recommended that the Install script be used for
building up the units specification.</p>

<p>Essentially, the exported metrics provide statistics on
the time for completion of each transaction, and an average
count of transactions completed and watch points passed over
a given time period.</p>

<p>INSTALLATION In order for a host to export the names,
help text and values for the Trace performance metrics, do
the following as root:</p>

<p># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/trace # ./Install</p>

<p>If you want to undo the installation, do the following
as root:</p>

<p># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/trace # ./Remove</p>

<p>pmdatrace is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be
executed directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify
pmcd(1) when the agent is installed or removed.</p>

<p>FILES $PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH command line options used to
launch pmdatrace $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/trace/help default help text
file for the trace metrics $PCP_DEMOS_DIR/trace/* example
programs which use the pcp_trace library
$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/trace/Install installation script for the
pmdatrace agent $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/trace/Remove undo
installation script for pmdatrace
$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/trace.log default log file for error
messages and other information from pmdatrace</p>

<p>PCP ENVIRONMENT Environment variables with the prefix
PCP_ are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP. On each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in pcp.conf(5).</p>
