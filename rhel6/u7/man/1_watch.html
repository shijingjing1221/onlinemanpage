<p>WATCH(1) Linux User s Manual WATCH(1)</p>

<p>NAME watch - execute a program periodically, showing
output fullscreen</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS watch [-dhvt] [-n &lt;seconds&gt;]
[--differences[=cumulative]] [--help]
[--interval=&lt;seconds&gt;] [--no-title] [--version]
&lt;command&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION watch runs command repeatedly, displaying
its output (the first screen- full). This allows you to
watch the program output change over time. By default, the
program is run every 2 seconds; use -n or --interval to
specify a different interval.</p>

<p>The -d or --differences flag will highlight the
differences between successive updates. The --cumulative
option makes highlighting &quot;sticky&quot;, presenting a
running display of all positions that have ever changed. The
-t or --no-title option turns off the header showing the
interval, command, and current time at the top of the
display, as well as the following blank line.</p>

<p>watch will run until interrupted.</p>

<p>NOTE Note that command is given to &quot;sh -c&quot;
which means that you may need to use extra quoting to get
the desired effect.</p>

<p>Note that POSIX option processing is used (i.e., option
processing stops at the first non-option argument). This
means that flags after command dont get interpreted by watch
itself.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES To watch for mail, you might do</p>

<p>watch -n 60 from</p>

<p>To watch the contents of a directory change, you could
use</p>

<p>watch -d ls -l</p>

<p>If youre only interested in files owned by user joe, you
might use</p>

<p>watch -d ls -l | fgrep joe</p>

<p>To see the effects of quoting, try these out</p>

<p>watch echo $$</p>

<p>watch echo $$</p>

<p>watch echo &quot;&quot;$$&quot;&quot;</p>

<p>You can watch for your administrator to install the
latest kernel with</p>

<p>watch uname -r</p>

<p>(Just kidding.)</p>

<p>BUGS Upon terminal resize, the screen will not be
correctly repainted until the next scheduled update. All
--differences highlighting is lost on that update as
well.</p>

<p>Non-printing characters are stripped from program
output. Use &quot;cat -v&quot; as part of the command
pipeline if you want to see them.</p>

<p>AUTHORS The original watch was written by Tony Rems
&lt;rembo@unisoft.com&gt; in 1991, with mods and corrections
by Francois Pinard. It was reworked and new features added
by Mike Coleman &lt;mkc@acm.org&gt; in 1999.</p>
