<p>TIFFOpen(3TIFF) TIFFOpen(3TIFF)</p>

<p>NAME TIFFOpen, TIFFFdOpen, TIFFClientOpen - open a TIFF
file for reading or writing</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tiffio.h&gt;</p>

<p>TIFF* TIFFOpen(const char *filename, const char *mode)
TIFF* TIFFFdOpen(const int fd, const char *filename, const
char *mode)</p>

<p>typedef tsize_t (*TIFFReadWriteProc)(thandle_t, tdata_t,
tsize_t); typedef toff_t (*TIFFSeekProc)(thandle_t, toff_t,
int); typedef int (*TIFFCloseProc)(thandle_t); typedef
toff_t (*TIFFSizeProc)(thandle_t); typedef int
(*TIFFMapFileProc)(thandle_t, tdata_t*, toff_t*); typedef
void (*TIFFUnmapFileProc)(thandle_t, tdata_t, toff_t);</p>

<p>TIFF* TIFFClientOpen(const char *filename, const char
*mode, thandle_t clientdata, TIFFReadWriteProc readproc,
TIFFReadWriteProc writeproc, TIFFSeekProc seekproc,
TIFFCloseProc closeproc, TIFFSizeProc sizeproc,
TIFFMapFileProc mapproc, TIFFUnmapFileProc unmapproc)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION TIFFOpen opens a TIFF file whose name is
filename and returns a handle to be used in subsequent calls
to routines in libtiff. If the open operation fails, then
zero is returned. The mode parameter specifies if the file
is to be opened for reading (r), writing (w ), or appending
(a ) and, optionally, whether to override certain default
aspects of library operation (see below). When a file is
opened for appending, existing data will not be touched;
instead new data will be written as additional subfiles. If
an existing file is opened for writing, all previous data is
overwritten.</p>

<p>If a file is opened for reading, the first TIFF
directory in the file is automatically read (also see
TIFFSetDirectory(3TIFF) for reading directories other than
the first). If a file is opened for writing or appending, a
default directory is automatically created for writing
subsequent data. This directory has all the default values
specified in TIFF Revision 6.0: BitsPerSample=1,
ThreshHolding=bilevel art scan, FillOrder=1 (most
significant bit of each data byte is filled first),
Orientation=1 (the 0th row represents the visual top of the
image, and the 0th column represents the visual left hand
side), SamplesPer- Pixel=1, RowsPerStrip=infinity,
ResolutionUnit=2 (inches), and Compres- sion=1 (no
compression). To alter these values, or to define values for
additional fields, TIFFSetField(3TIFF) must be used.</p>

<p>TIFFFdOpen is like TIFFOpen except that it opens a TIFF
file given an open file descriptor fd. The files name and
mode must reflect that of the open descriptor. The object
associated with the file descriptor must support random
access.</p>

<p>TIFFClientOpen is like TIFFOpen except that the caller
supplies a col- lection of functions that the library will
use to do UNIX-like I/O operations. The readproc and
writeproc are called to read and write data at the current
file position. seekproc is called to change the current file
position a la lseek(2). closeproc is invoked to release any
resources associated with an open file. sizeproc is invoked
to obtain the size in bytes of a file. mapproc and unmapproc
are called to map and unmap a file s contents in memory;
c.f. mmap(2) and mun- map(2). The clientdata parameter is an
opaque handle passed to the client-specified routines passed
as parameters to TIFFClientOpen.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The open mode parameter can include the
following flags in addition to the r , w, and a flags. Note
however that option flags must follow the read-write-append
specification.</p>

<p>l When creating a new file force information be written
with Lit- tle-Endian byte order (but see below). By default
the library will create new files using the native CPU byte
order.</p>

<p>b When creating a new file force information be written
with Big- Endian byte order (but see below). By default the
library will create new files using the native CPU byte
order.</p>

<p>L Force image data that is read or written to be treated
with bits filled from Least Significant Bit (LSB) to Most
Significant Bit (MSB). Note that this is the opposite to the
way the library has worked from its inception.</p>

<p>B Force image data that is read or written to be treated
with bits filled from Most Significant Bit (MSB) to Least
Significant Bit (LSB); this is the default.</p>

<p>H Force image data that is read or written to be treated
with bits filled in the same order as the native CPU.</p>

<p>M Enable the use of memory-mapped files for images
opened read- only. If the underlying system does not support
memory-mapped files or if the specific image being opened
cannot be memory- mapped then the library will fallback to
using the normal system interface for reading information.
By default the library will attempt to use memory-mapped
files.</p>

<p>m Disable the use of memory-mapped files.</p>

<p>C Enable the use of strip chopping when reading images
that are comprised of a single strip or tile of uncompressed
data. Strip chopping is a mechanism by which the library
will automat- ically convert the single-strip image to
multiple strips, each of which has about 8 Kilobytes of
data. This facility can be useful in reducing the amount of
memory used to read an image because the library normally
reads each strip in its entirety. Strip chopping does
however alter the apparent contents of the image because
when an image is divided into multiple strips it looks as
though the underlying file contains multiple separate
strips. Finally, note that default handling of strip
chopping is a compile-time configuration parameter. The
default behaviour, for backwards compatibility, is to enable
strip chop- ping.</p>

<p>c Disable the use of strip chopping when reading
images.</p>

<p>h Read TIFF header only, do not load the first image
directory. That could be useful in case of the broken first
directory. We can open the file and proceed to the other
directories.</p>

<p>BYTE ORDER The TIFF specification (all versions) states
that compliant readers must be capable of reading images
written in either byte order. Nonetheless some software that
claims to support the reading of TIFF images is incapable of
reading images in anything but the native CPU byte order on
which the software was written. (Especially notorious are
applications written to run on Intel-based machines.) By
default the library will create new files with the native
byte-order of the CPU on which the application is run. This
ensures optimal performance and is portable to any
application that conforms to the TIFF specification. To
force the library to use a specific byte-order when creating
a new file the b and l option flags may be included in the
call to open a file; for example, wb or wl.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUES Upon successful completion TIFFOpen,
TIFFFdOpen, and TIFFClientOpen return a TIFF pointer.
Otherwise, NULL is returned.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS All error messages are directed to the
TIFFError(3TIFF) routine. Like- wise, warning messages are
directed to the TIFFWarning(3TIFF) routine.</p>

<p>&quot;%s&quot;: Bad mode. The specified mode parameter
was not one of r (read), w (write), or a (append).</p>

<p>%s: Cannot open. TIFFOpen() was unable to open the
specified filename for read/writing.</p>

<p>Cannot read TIFF header. An error occurred while
attempting to read the header information.</p>

<p>Error writing TIFF header. An error occurred while
writing the default header information for a new file.</p>

<p>Not a TIFF file, bad magic number %d (0x%x). The magic
number in the header was not (hex) 0x4d4d or (hex)
0x4949.</p>

<p>Not a TIFF file, bad version number %d (0x%x). The
version field in the header was not 42 (decimal).</p>

<p>Cannot append to file that has opposite byte ordering. A
file with a byte ordering opposite to the native byte
ordering of the current machine was opened for appending ( a
). This is a limitation of the library.</p>
