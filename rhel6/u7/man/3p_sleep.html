<p>SLEEP(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual SLEEP(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME sleep - suspend execution for an interval of
time</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>unsigned sleep(unsigned seconds);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sleep() function shall cause the calling
thread to be suspended from execution until either the
number of realtime seconds specified by the argument seconds
has elapsed or a signal is delivered to the call- ing thread
and its action is to invoke a signal-catching function or to
terminate the process. The suspension time may be longer
than requested due to the scheduling of other activity by
the system.</p>

<p>If a SIGALRM signal is generated for the calling process
during execu- tion of sleep() and if the SIGALRM signal is
being ignored or blocked from delivery, it is unspecified
whether sleep() returns when the SIGALRM signal is
scheduled. If the signal is being blocked, it is also
unspecified whether it remains pending after sleep() returns
or it is discarded.</p>

<p>If a SIGALRM signal is generated for the calling process
during execu- tion of sleep(), except as a result of a prior
call to alarm(), and if the SIGALRM signal is not being
ignored or blocked from delivery, it is unspecified whether
that signal has any effect other than causing sleep() to
return.</p>

<p>If a signal-catching function interrupts sleep() and
examines or changes either the time a SIGALRM is scheduled
to be generated, the action associated with the SIGALRM
signal, or whether the SIGALRM sig- nal is blocked from
delivery, the results are unspecified.</p>

<p>If a signal-catching function interrupts sleep() and
calls siglongjmp() or longjmp() to restore an environment
saved prior to the sleep() call, the action associated with
the SIGALRM signal and the time at which a SIGALRM signal is
scheduled to be generated are unspecified. It is also
unspecified whether the SIGALRM signal is blocked, unless
the process signal mask is restored as part of the
environment.</p>

<p>Interactions between sleep() and any of setitimer(),
ualarm(), or usleep() are unspecified.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE If sleep() returns because the requested
time has elapsed, the value returned shall be 0. If sleep()
returns due to delivery of a signal, the return value shall
be the &quot;unslept&quot; amount (the requested time minus
the time actually slept) in seconds.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE There are two general approaches to the
implementation of the sleep() function. One is to use the
alarm() function to schedule a SIGALRM sig- nal and then
suspend the process waiting for that signal. The other is to
implement an independent facility. This volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001 permits either approach.</p>

<p>In order to comply with the requirement that no
primitive shall change a process attribute unless explicitly
described by this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, an
implementation using SIGALRM must carefully take into
account any SIGALRM signal scheduled by previous alarm()
calls, the action previously established for SIGALRM, and
whether SIGALRM was blocked. If a SIGALRM has been scheduled
before the sleep() would ordinarily complete, the sleep()
must be shortened to that time and a SIGALRM generated
(possibly simulated by direct invocation of the
signal-catching function) before sleep() returns. If a
SIGALRM has been scheduled after the sleep() would
ordinarily complete, it must be rescheduled for the same
time before sleep() returns. The action and blocking for
SIGALRM must be saved and restored.</p>

<p>Historical implementations often implement the
SIGALRM-based version using alarm() and pause(). One such
implementation is prone to infinite hangups, as described in
pause(). Another such implementation uses the C-language
setjmp() and longjmp() functions to avoid that window. That
implementation introduces a different problem: when the
SIGALRM signal interrupts a signal-catching function
installed by the user to catch a different signal, the
longjmp() aborts that signal-catching function. An
implementation based on sigprocmask(), alarm(), and
sigsuspend() can avoid these problems.</p>

<p>Despite all reasonable care, there are several very
subtle, but detectable and unavoidable, differences between
the two types of imple- mentations. These are the cases
mentioned in this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 where some
other activity relating to SIGALRM takes place, and the
results are stated to be unspecified. All of these cases are
sufficiently unusual as not to be of concern to most
applications.</p>

<p>See also the discussion of the term realtime in alarm()
.</p>

<p>Since sleep() can be implemented using alarm(), the
discussion about alarms occurring early under alarm()
applies to sleep() as well.</p>

<p>Application writers should note that the type of the
argument seconds and the return value of sleep() is
unsigned. That means that a Strictly Conforming POSIX System
Interfaces Application cannot pass a value greater than the
minimum guaranteed value for {UINT_MAX}, which the ISO C
standard sets as 65535, and any application passing a larger
value is restricting its portability. A different type was
considered, but historical implementations, including those
with a 16-bit int type, consistently use either unsigned or
int.</p>

<p>Scheduling delays may cause the process to return from
the sleep() function significantly after the requested time.
In such cases, the return value should be set to zero, since
the formula (requested time minus the time actually spent)
yields a negative number and sleep() returns an
unsigned.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
