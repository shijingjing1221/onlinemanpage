<p>NAME pnmpsnr - compute the difference between two images
(the PSNR)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pnmpsnr</p>

<p>[pnmfile1]</p>

<p>[pnmfile2]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pnmpsnr reads two PBM, PGM, or PPM files, or PAM
equivalents, as input and prints the magnitude of difference
between the two images as a peak signal-to-noise ratio
(PSNR) This metric is typically used in image compression
papers to rate the distortion between original and decoded
image.</p>

<p>If the inputs are PBM or PGM, pnmpsnr prints the PSNR of
the luminance only. Otherwise, it prints the separate PSNRs
of the luminance, and chrominance (Cb and Cr) components of
the colors.</p>

<p>The PSNR of a given component is the ratio of the
maximum mean square difference of component values that
could exist between the two images (a measure of the
information content in an image) to the actual mean square
difference for the two subject images. It is expressed as a
decibel value.</p>

<p>The mean square difference of a component for two images
is the mean square difference of the component value,
comparing each pixel with the pixel in the same position of
the other image. For the purposes of this computation,
components are normalized to the scale [0..1].</p>

<p>The maximum mean square difference is identically 1.</p>

<p>So the higher the PSNR, the closer the images are. A
luminance PSNR of 20 means the mean square difference of the
luminances of the pixels is 100 times less than the maximum
possible difference, i.e. 0.01.</p>
