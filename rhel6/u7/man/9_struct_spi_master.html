<p>STRUCT SPI_MASTER(9) Serial Peripheral Interface (S
STRUCT SPI_MASTER(9)</p>

<p>NAME struct_spi_master - interface to SPI master
controller</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS struct spi_master { struct device dev; s16
bus_num; u16 num_chipselect; u16 dma_alignment; u16
mode_bits; u16 flags; #define SPI_MASTER_HALF_DUPLEX BIT(0)
#define SPI_MASTER_NO_RX BIT(1) #define SPI_MASTER_NO_TX
BIT(2) int (* setup) (struct spi_device *spi); int (*
transfer) (struct spi_device *spi,struct spi_message *mesg);
void (* cleanup) (struct spi_device *spi); };</p>

<p>MEMBERS dev device interface to this driver</p>

<p>bus_num board-specific (and often SOC-specific)
identifier for a given SPI controller.</p>

<p>num_chipselect chipselects are used to distinguish
individual SPI slaves, and are numbered from zero to
num_chipselects. each slave has a chipselect signal, but
it&acute;s common that not every chipselect is connected to
a slave.</p>

<p>dma_alignment SPI controller constraint on DMA buffers
alignment.</p>

<p>mode_bits flags understood by this controller driver</p>

<p>flags other constraints relevant to this driver</p>

<p>setup updates the device mode and clocking records used
by a device&acute;s SPI controller; protocol code may call
this. This must fail if an unrecognized or unsupported mode
is requested. It&acute;s always safe to call this unless
transfers are pending on the device whose settings are being
modified.</p>

<p>transfer adds a message to the controller&acute;s
transfer queue.</p>

<p>cleanup frees controller-specific state</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Each SPI master controller can communicate
with one or more spi_device children. These make a small
bus, sharing MOSI, MISO and SCK signals but not chip select
signals. Each device may be configured to use a different
clock rate, since those shared signals are ignored unless
the chip is selected.</p>

<p>The driver for an SPI controller manages access to those
devices through a queue of spi_message transactions, copying
data between CPU memory and an SPI slave device. For each
such message it queues, it calls the message&acute;s
completion function when the transaction completes.</p>
