<p>STDIN(3) Linux Programmer s Manual STDIN(3)</p>

<p>NAME stdin, stdout, stderr - standard I/O streams</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</p>

<p>extern FILE *stdin; extern FILE *stdout; extern FILE
*stderr;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Under normal circumstances every Unix
program has three streams opened for it when it starts up,
one for input, one for output, and one for printing
diagnostic or error messages. These are typically attached
to the user s terminal (see tty(4) but might instead refer
to files or other devices, depending on what the parent
process chose to set up. (See also the
&quot;Redirection&quot; section of sh(1).)</p>

<p>The input stream is referred to as &quot;standard
input&quot;; the output stream is referred to as
&quot;standard output&quot;; and the error stream is
referred to as &quot;standard error&quot;. These terms are
abbreviated to form the sym- bols used to refer to these
files, namely stdin, stdout, and stderr.</p>

<p>Each of these symbols is a stdio(3) macro of type
pointer to FILE, and can be used with functions like
fprintf(3) or fread(3).</p>

<p>Since FILEs are a buffering wrapper around Unix file
descriptors, the same underlying files may also be accessed
using the raw Unix file interface, that is, the functions
like read(2) and lseek(2).</p>

<p>On program startup, the integer file descriptors
associated with the streams stdin, stdout, and stderr are 0,
1, and 2, respectively. The preprocessor symbols
STDIN_FILENO, STDOUT_FILENO, and STDERR_FILENO are defined
with these values in &lt;unistd.h&gt;. (Applying freopen(3)
to one of these streams can change the file descriptor
number associated with the stream.)</p>

<p>Note that mixing use of FILEs and raw file descriptors
can produce unexpected results and should generally be
avoided. (For the masochis- tic among you: POSIX.1, section
8.2.3, describes in detail how this interaction is supposed
to work.) A general rule is that file descrip- tors are
handled in the kernel, while stdio is just a library. This
means for example, that after an exec(3), the child inherits
all open file descriptors, but all old streams have become
inaccessible.</p>

<p>Since the symbols stdin, stdout, and stderr are
specified to be macros, assigning to them is non-portable.
The standard streams can be made to refer to different files
with help of the library function freopen(3), specially
introduced to make it possible to reassign stdin, stdout,
and stderr. The standard streams are closed by a call to
exit(3) and by normal program termination.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO The stdin, stdout, and stderr macros
conform to C89 and this standard also stipulates that these
three streams shall be open at program startup.</p>

<p>NOTES The stream stderr is unbuffered. The stream stdout
is line-buffered when it points to a terminal. Partial lines
will not appear until fflush(3) or exit(3) is called, or a
newline is printed. This can pro- duce unexpected results,
especially with debugging output. The buffering mode of the
standard streams (or any other stream) can be changed using
the setbuf(3) or setvbuf(3) call. Note that in case stdin is
associated with a terminal, there may also be input
buffering in the terminal driver, entirely unrelated to
stdio buffering. (Indeed, normally terminal input is line
buffered in the kernel.) This kernel input handling can be
modified using calls like tcsetattr(3); see also stty(1),
and termios(3).</p>
