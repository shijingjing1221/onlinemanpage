<p>setpci(8) The PCI Utilities setpci(8)</p>

<p>NAME setpci - configure PCI devices</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS setpci [options] devices operations...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION setpci is a utility for querying and
configuring PCI devices.</p>

<p>All numbers are entered in hexadecimal notation.</p>

<p>Root privileges are necessary for almost all operations,
excluding reads of the standard header of the configuration
space on some operat- ing systems. Please see lspci(8) for
details on access rights.</p>

<p>OPTIONS General options -v Tells setpci to be verbose
and display detailed information about configuration space
accesses.</p>

<p>-f Tells setpci not to complain when theres nothing to
do (when no devices are selected). This option is intended
for use in widely-distributed configuration scripts where it
s uncertain whether the device in question is present in the
machine or not.</p>

<p>-D Demo mode -- don t write anything to the
configuration regis- ters. Its useful to try setpci -vD to
verify that your complex sequence of setpci operations does
what you think it should do.</p>

<p>--version Show setpci version. This option should be
used stand-alone.</p>

<p>--help Show detailed help on available options. This
option should be used stand-alone.</p>

<p>--dumpregs Show a list of all known PCI registers and
capabilities. This option should be used stand-alone.</p>

<p>PCI access options The PCI utilities use the PCI library
to talk to PCI devices (see pcilib(7) for details). You can
use the following options to influence its behavior:</p>

<p>-A &lt;method&gt; The library supports a variety of
methods to access the PCI hardware. By default, it uses the
first access method avail- able, but you can use this option
to override this decision. See -A help for a list of
available methods and their descriptions.</p>

<p>-O &lt;param&gt;=&lt;value&gt; The behavior of the
library is controlled by several named parameters. This
option allows to set the value of any of the parameters. Use
-O help for a list of known parameters and their default
values.</p>

<p>-H1 Use direct hardware access via Intel configuration
mechanism 1. (This is a shorthand for -A intel-conf1.)</p>

<p>-H2 Use direct hardware access via Intel configuration
mechanism 2. (This is a shorthand for -A intel-conf2.)</p>

<p>-G Increase debug level of the library.</p>

<p>DEVICE SELECTION Before each sequence of operations you
need to select which devices you wish that operation to
affect.</p>

<p>-s
[[[[&lt;domain&gt;]:]&lt;bus&gt;]:][&lt;slot&gt;][.[&lt;func&gt;]]
Consider only devices in the specified domain (in case your
machine has several host bridges, they can either share a
common bus number space or each of them can address a PCI
domain of its own; domains are numbered from 0 to ffff), bus
(0 to ff), slot (0 to 1f) and function (0 to 7). Each
component of the device address can be omitted or set to
&quot;*&quot;, both meaning &quot;any value&quot;. All
numbers are hexadecimal. E.g., &quot;0:&quot; means all
devices on bus 0, &quot;0&quot; means all functions of
device 0 on any bus, &quot;0.3&quot; selects third function
of device 0 on all buses and &quot;.4&quot; matches only the
fourth function of each device.</p>

<p>-d [&lt;vendor&gt;]:[&lt;device&gt;] Select devices with
specified vendor and device ID. Both IDs are given in
hexadecimal and may be omitted or given as &quot;*&quot;,
both meaning &quot;any value&quot;.</p>

<p>When -s and -d are combined, only devices that match
both criteria are selected. When multiple options of the
same kind are specified, the rightmost one overrides the
others.</p>

<p>OPERATIONS There are two kinds of operations: reads and
writes. To read a regis- ter, just specify its name. Writes
have the form name=value,value... where each value is either
a hexadecimal number or an expression of type data:mask
where both data and mask are hexadecimal numbers. In the
latter case, only the bits corresponding to binary ones in
the mask are changed (technically, this is a
read-modify-write operation).</p>

<p>There are several ways how to identity a register:</p>

<p>&middot; Tell its address in hexadecimal.</p>

<p>&middot; Spell its name. Setpci knows the names of all
registers in the standard configuration headers. Use setpci
--dumpregs to get the complete list. See PCI bus
specifications for the precise meaning of these registers or
consult header.h or /usr/include/pci/pci.h for a brief
sketch.</p>

<p>&middot; If the register is a part of a PCI capability,
you can specify the name of the capability to get the
address of its first reg- ister. See the names starting with
CAP_ or ECAP_ in the --dumpregs output.</p>

<p>&middot; If the name of the capability is not known to
setpci, you can refer to it by its number in the form CAPid
or ECAPid, where id is the numeric identifier of the
capability in hexadecimal.</p>

<p>&middot; Each of the previous formats can be followed by
+offset to add an offset (a hex number) to the address. This
feature can be useful for addressing of registers living
within a capability, or to modify parts of standard
registers.</p>

<p>&middot; Finally, you should append a width specifier
.B, .W, or .L to choose how many bytes (1, 2, or 4) should
be transferred. The width can be omitted if you are
referring to a register by its name and the width of the
register is well known.</p>

<p>All names of registers and width specifiers are
case-insensitive.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES COMMAND asks for the word-sized command
register.</p>

<p>4.w is a numeric address of the same register.</p>

<p>COMMAND.l asks for a 32-bit word starting at the
location of the command register, i.e., the command and
status registers together.</p>

<p>VENDOR_ID+1.b specifies the upper byte of the vendor ID
register (remember, PCI is little-endian).</p>

<p>CAP_PM+2.w corresponds to the second word of the power
management capabil- ity.</p>

<p>ECAP108.l asks for the first 32-bit word of the extended
capability with ID 0x108.</p>
