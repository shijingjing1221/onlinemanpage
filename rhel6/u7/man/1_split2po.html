<p>NAME split2po - Creates a po file from two DocBook XML
files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS split2po {Original-XMLTranslated-XML}</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION split2po is a command-line tool that takes
the two given DocBook XML files and produces a gettext
message file (PO-file) that represents the changes between
them. The resulting PO-file is sent to standard output.</p>

<p>translated-XML must be the result of translating
original-XML into an- other language. It is this translation
that the resulting PO-file will represent.</p>

<p>This utility is part of the KDE Software Development
Kit.</p>
