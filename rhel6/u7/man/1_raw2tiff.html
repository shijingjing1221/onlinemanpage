<p>NAME raw2tiff - create a TIFF file from a raw data</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS raw2tiff [ options ] input.raw output.tif</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION raw2tiff converts a raw byte sequence into
TIFF. By default, the TIFF image is created with data
samples packed (PlanarConfiguration=1), com- pressed with
the PackBits algorithm (Compression=32773), and with each
strip no more than 8 kilobytes. These characteristics can
overridden, or explicitly specified with the options
described below.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -H number size of input image file header in
bytes (0 by default). This amount of data just will be
skipped from the start of file while reading.</p>

<p>-w number width of input image in pixels (can be
guessed, see GUESSING THE IMAGE GEOMETRY below).</p>

<p>-l number length of input image in lines (can be
guessed, see GUESSING THE IMAGE GEOMETRY below).</p>

<p>-b number number of bands in input image (1 by
default).</p>

<p>-d data_type type of samples in input image, where
data_type may be: byte 8-bit unsigned integer (default),
short 16-bit unsigned integer, long 32-bit unsigned integer,
sbyte 8-bit signed integer, sshort 16-bit signed integer,
slong 32-bit signed integer, float 32-bit IEEE floating
point, double 64-bit IEEE floating point.</p>

<p>-i config type of samples interleaving in input image,
where config may be: pixel pixel interleaved data (default),
band band interleaved data.</p>

<p>-p photo photometric interpretation (color space) of the
input image, where photo may be: miniswhite white color
represented with 0 value, minisblack black color represented
with 0 value (default), rgb image has RGB color model, cmyk
image has CMYK (separated) color model, ycbcr image has
YCbCr color model, cielab image has CIE L*a*b color model,
icclab image has ICC L*a*b color model, itulab image has ITU
L*a*b color model.</p>

<p>-s swap bytes fetched from the input file.</p>

<p>-L input data has LSB2MSB bit order (default).</p>

<p>-M input data has MSB2LSB bit order.</p>

<p>-c Specify a compression scheme to use when writing
image data: -c none for no compression, -c packbits for the
PackBits compres- sion algorithm (the default), -c jpeg for
the baseline JPEG com- pression algorithm, -c zip for the
Deflate compression algo- rithm, and -c lzw for Lempel-Ziv
&amp; Welch.</p>

<p>-r number Write data with a specified number of rows per
strip; by default the number of rows/strip is selected so
that each strip is approximately 8 kilobytes.</p>

<p>GUESSING THE IMAGE GEOMETRY raw2tiff can guess image
width and height in case one or both of these parameters are
not specified. If you omit one of those parameters, the
complementary one will be calculated based on the file size
(taking into account header size, number of bands and data
type). If you omit both parameters, the statistical approach
will be used. Utility will compute correlation coefficient
between two lines at the image center using several
appropriate line sizes and the highest absolute value of the
coefficient will indicate the right line size. That is why
you should be cautious with the very large images, because
guessing process may take a while (depending on your system
performance). Of course, the utility cant guess the header
size, number of bands and data type, so it should be
specified manually. If you dont know anything about your
image, just try with the several combinations of those
options.</p>

<p>There is no magic, it is just a mathematical statistics,
so it can be wrong in some cases. But for most ordinary
images guessing method will work fine.</p>
