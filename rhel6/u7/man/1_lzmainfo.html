<p>NAME lzmainfo - show infomation stored in the .lzma file
header</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS lzmainfo [--help] [--version] [file]...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION lzmainfo shows information stored in the
.lzma file header. It reads the first 13 bytes from the
specified file, decodes the header, and prints it to
standard output in human readable format. If no files are
given or file is -, standard input is read.</p>

<p>Usually the most interesting information is the
uncompressed size and the dictionary size. Uncompressed size
can be shown only if the file is in the non-streamed .lzma
format variant. The amount of memory required to decompress
the file is a few dozen kilobytes plus the dictionary
size.</p>

<p>lzmainfo is included in XZ Utils primarily for backward
compatibility with LZMA Utils.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS 0 All is good.</p>

<p>1 An error occurred.</p>

<p>BUGS lzmainfo uses MB while the correct suffix would be
MiB (2^20 bytes). This is to keep the output compatible with
LZMA Utils.</p>
