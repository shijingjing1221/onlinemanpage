<p>NAME mii-diag - Network adapter control and
monitoring</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS mii-diag [options]&lt;interface&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page documents briefly the
mii-diag network adapter control and monitoring command.
Addition documentation is available from
http://scyld.com/diag/index.html.</p>

<p>This mii-diag command configures, controls and monitors
the transceiver management registers for network interfaces,
and configures driver operational parameters. For
transceiver control mii-diag uses the Media Independent
Interface (MII) standard (thus the command name). It also
has additional Linux-specific controls to communicate
parameters such as message enable settings and buffer sizes
to the underlying device driver.</p>

<p>The MII standard defines registers that control and
report network transceiver capabilities, link settings and
errors. Examples are link speed, duplex, capabilities
advertised to the link partner, status LED indications and
link error counters.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The mii-diag command supports both single
character and long option names. Short options use a single
dash (&acute;-&acute;) in front of the option character. For
options without parameters, multiple options may be
concatenated after a single dash. Long options are prefixed
by two dashes (&acute;--&acute;), and may be abbreviated
with a unique prefix. A long option may take a parameter of
the form --arg=param or --arg param.</p>

<p>A summary of options is as follows.</p>

<p>-A, --advertise &lt;speed|setting&gt; -F, --fixed-speed
&lt;speed|setting&gt;</p>

<p>Speed is one of: 100baseT4, 100baseTx, 100baseTx-FD,
100baseTx- HD, 10baseT, 10baseT-FD, 10baseT-HD. For more
precise control an explict numeric register setting is also
allowed.</p>

<p>-a, --all-interfaces Show the status of all interfaces.
This option is not recom- mended with any other option,
especially ones that change set- tings.</p>

<p>-s,--status Return exit status 2 if there is no link
beat.</p>

<p>-D Increase the debugging level. This may be used to
understand the actions the command is taking.</p>

<p>-g, --read-parameters Show driver-specific
parameters.</p>

<p>-G, --set-parameters value[,value...] Set
driver-specific parameters. Set a adapter-specific parame-
ters. Parameters are comma separated, with missing elements
retaining the existing value.</p>

<p>-v Increase the verbosity level. Additional
&quot;-v&quot; options increase the level further.</p>

<p>-V Show the program version information.</p>

<p>-w, --watch Continuously monitor the transceiver and
report changes.</p>

<p>-? Emit usage information.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Calling the command with just the interface
name (which defaults to capabilities, configuration and
current status.</p>

<p>The --monitor option allows scripting link beat
changes.</p>

<p>This option is similar to --watch, but with lower
overhead and sim- plifed output. It polls the interface only
once a second and the out- put format is a single line per
link change with three fixed words
&lt;unknown|down||negotiating|up&gt; &lt;STATUS&gt;
&lt;PARTNER-CAP&gt;</p>

<p>Example output: mii-diag --monitor eth0 down 0x7809
0x0000 negotiating 0x7829 0x45e1 up 0x782d 0x45e1 down
0x7809 0x0000</p>

<p>This may be used as mii-diag --monitor eth0 | while read
linkstatus bmsr linkpar; do case $linkstatus in up) ifup
eth0 ;; down) ifdown eth0 ;; esac done</p>

<p>It may be useful to shorten the DHCP client daemon
timeout if it does not receive an address by adding the
following setting to /etc/syscon- fig/network:
DHCPCDARGS=&quot;-t 3&quot;</p>

<p>SEE ALSO ether-wake(8),net-diag(8),mii-tool(8). Addition
documentation is available from
http://scyld.com/diag/index.html.</p>

<p>KNOWN BUGS The --all-interfaces option is quirky. There
are very few settings that are usefully applied to all
interfaces.</p>

of the underlying Linux network drivers were written by
Donald Becker for the Scyld Beowulf() cluster system.</p>
