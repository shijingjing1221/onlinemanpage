<p>UUCP(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual UUCP(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME uucp - system-to-system copy</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS uucp [-cCdfjmr][-n user] source-file...
destination-file</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The uucp utility shall copy files named by
the source-file argument to the destination-file argument.
The files named can be on local or remote systems.</p>

<p>The uucp utility cannot guarantee support for all
character encodings in all circumstances. For example,
transmission data may be restricted to 7 bits by the
underlying network, 8-bit data and filenames need not be
portable to non-internationalized systems, and so on. Under
these circumstances, it is recommended that only characters
defined in the ISO/IEC 646:1991 standard International
Reference Version (equivalent to ASCII) 7-bit range of
characters be used, and that only characters defined in the
portable filename character set be used for naming files.
The protocol for transfer of files is unspecified by IEEE
Std 1003.1-2001.</p>

<p>Typical implementations of this utility require a
communications line configured to use the Base Definitions
volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Chapter 11, General Terminal
Interface, but other communications means may be used. On
systems where there are no available communications means
(either temporarily or permanently), this utility shall
write an error message describing the problem and exit with
a non-zero exit sta- tus.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The uucp utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>The following options shall be supported:</p>

<p>-c Do not copy local file to the spool directory for
transfer to the remote machine (default).</p>

<p>-C Force the copy of local files to the spool directory
for trans- fer.</p>

<p>-d Make all necessary directories for the file copy
(default).</p>

<p>-f Do not make intermediate directories for the file
copy.</p>

<p>-j Write the job identification string to standard
output. This job identification can be used by uustat to
obtain the status or terminate a job.</p>

<p>-m Send mail to the requester when the copy is
completed.</p>

<p>-n user Notify user on the remote system that a file was
sent.</p>

<p>-r Do not start the file transfer; just queue the
job.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operands shall be supported:</p>

<p>destination-file, source-file</p>

<p>A pathname of a file to be copied to, or from,
respectively. Either name can be a pathname on the local
machine, or can have the form:</p>

<p>system-name!pathname</p>

<p>where system-name is taken from a list of system names
that uucp knows about. The destination system-name can also
be a list of names such as:</p>

<p>system-name!system-name!...!system-name!pathname</p>

<p>in which case, an attempt is made to send the file via
the specified route to the destination. Care should be taken
to ensure that interme- diate nodes in the route are willing
to forward information.</p>

<p>The shell pattern matching notation characters, * , and
&quot;[...]&quot; appearing in pathname shall be expanded on
the appropriate system.</p>

<p>Pathnames can be one of:</p>

<p>1. An absolute pathname.</p>

<p>2. A pathname preceded by ~ user where user is a login
name on the specified system and is replaced by that users
login directory. Note that if an invalid login is specified,
the default is to the public directory (called PUBDIR; the
actual location of PUBDIR is implementation-defined).</p>

<p>3. A pathname preceded by ~/ destination where
destination is appended to PUBDIR.</p>

<p>Note: This destination is treated as a filename unless
more than one file is being transferred by this request or
the destination is already a directory. To ensure that it is
a directory, follow the destination with a/. For example,
~/dan/ as the destination makes the directory PUBDIR/dan if
it does not exist and puts the requested files in that
directory.</p>

<p>4. Anything else shall be prefixed by the current
directory.</p>

<p>If the result is an erroneous pathname for the remote
system, the copy shall fail. If the destination-file is a
directory, the last part of the source-file name shall be
used.</p>

<p>The read, write, and execute permissions given by uucp
are implementa- tion-defined.</p>

<p>STDIN Not used.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES The files to be copied are regular
files.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of uucp:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_COLLATE</p>

<p>Determine the locale for the behavior of ranges,
equivalence classes, and multi-character collating elements
within bracketed filename patterns.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments
and input files) and the behavior of character classes
within bracketed filename patterns (for example,
[[:lower:]]&quot; ).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error, and informative messages written
to standard output.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT Not used.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES The output files (which may be on other
systems) are copies of the input files.</p>

<p>If -m is used, mail files are modified.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 Successful completion.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The domain of remotely accessible
files can (and for obvious security reasons usually should)
be severely restricted.</p>

<p>Note that the !character in addresses has to be escaped
when using csh as a command interpreter because of its
history substitution syn- tax. For ksh and sh the escape is
not necessary, but may be used.</p>

<p>As noted above, shell metacharacters appearing in
pathnames are expanded on the appropriate system. On an
internationalized system, this is done under the control of
local settings of LC_COLLATE and LC_CTYPE. Thus, care should
be taken when using bracketed filename patterns, as
collation and typing rules may vary from one system to
another. Also be aware that certain types of expression
(that is, equivalence classes, character classes, and
collating symbols) need not be supported on
non-internationalized systems.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
