<p>NAME iostat - Report Central Processing Unit (CPU)
statistics and input/out- put statistics for devices,
partitions and network filesystems (NFS).</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS iostat [ -c ] [ -d ] [ -N ] [ -n ] [ -h ] [ -k
| -m ] [ -t ] [ -V ] [ -x ] [ -y ] [ -z ] [ -j { ID | LABEL
| PATH | UUID | ... } [ device [...] | ALL ] ] [ device
[...] | ALL ] [ -p [ device [,...] | ALL ] ] [ interval [
count ] ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The iostat command is used for monitoring
system input/output device loading by observing the time the
devices are active in relation to their average transfer
rates. The iostat command generates reports that can be used
to change system configuration to better balance the
input/output load between physical disks.</p>

<p>The first report generated by the iostat command
provides statistics concerning the time since the system was
booted, unless the -y option is used, when this first report
is omitted. Each subsequent report cov- ers the time since
the previous report. All statistics are reported each time
the iostat command is run. The report consists of a CPU
header row followed by a row of CPU statistics. On
multiprocessor sys- tems, CPU statistics are calculated
system-wide as averages among all processors. A device
header row is displayed followed by a line of statistics for
each device that is configured. When option -n is used, an
NFS header row is displayed followed by a line of statistics
for each network filesystem that is mounted.</p>

<p>The interval parameter specifies the amount of time in
seconds between each report. The first report contains
statistics for the time since system startup (boot), unless
the -y option is used, when this report is omitted. Each
subsequent report contains statistics collected dur- ing the
interval since the previous report. The count parameter can
be specified in conjunction with the interval parameter. If
the count parameter is specified, the value of count
determines the number of reports generated at interval
seconds apart. If the interval parameter is specified
without the count parameter, the iostat command generates
reports continuously.</p>

<p>REPORTS The iostat command generates three types of
reports, the CPU Utiliza- tion report, the Device
Utilization report and the Network Filesystem report.</p>

<p>CPU Utilization Report The first report generated by the
iostat command is the CPU Uti- lization Report. For
multiprocessor systems, the CPU values are global averages
among all processors. The report has the fol- lowing
format:</p>

<p>%user Show the percentage of CPU utilization that
occurred while executing at the user level
(application).</p>

<p>%nice Show the percentage of CPU utilization that
occurred while executing at the user level with nice
priority.</p>

<p>%system Show the percentage of CPU utilization that
occurred while executing at the system level (kernel).</p>

<p>%iowait Show the percentage of time that the CPU or CPUs
were idle during which the system had an outstanding disk
I/O request.</p>

<p>%steal Show the percentage of time spent in involuntary
wait by the virtual CPU or CPUs while the hypervisor was
servic- ing another virtual processor.</p>

<p>%idle Show the percentage of time that the CPU or CPUs
were idle and the system did not have an outstanding disk
I/O request.</p>

<p>Device Utilization Report The second report generated by
the iostat command is the Device Utilization Report. The
device report provides statistics on a per physical device
or partition basis. Block devices for which statistics are
to be displayed may be entered on the command line.
Partitions may also be entered on the command line provid-
ing that option -x is not used. If no device nor partition
is entered, then statistics are displayed for every device
used by the system, and providing that the kernel maintains
statistics for it. If the ALL keyword is given on the
command line, then statistics are displayed for every device
defined by the system, including those that have never been
used. The report may show the following fields, depending on
the flags used:</p>

<p>Device: This column gives the device (or partition)
name, which is displayed as hdiskn with 2.2 kernels, for the
nth device. It is displayed as devm-n with 2.4 kernels,
where m is the major number of the device, and n a
distinctive number. With newer kernels, the device name as
listed in the /dev directory is displayed.</p>

<p>tps Indicate the number of transfers per second that
were issued to the device. A transfer is an I/O request to
the device. Multiple logical requests can be combined into a
single I/O request to the device. A transfer is of inde-
terminate size.</p>

<p>Blk_read/s Indicate the amount of data read from the
device expressed in a number of blocks per second. Blocks
are equivalent to sectors with kernels 2.4 and later and
therefore have a size of 512 bytes. With older kernels, a
block is of indeterminate size.</p>

<p>Blk_wrtn/s Indicate the amount of data written to the
device expressed in a number of blocks per second.</p>

<p>Blk_read The total number of blocks read.</p>

<p>Blk_wrtn The total number of blocks written.</p>

<p>kB_read/s Indicate the amount of data read from the
device expressed in kilobytes per second.</p>

<p>kB_wrtn/s Indicate the amount of data written to the
device expressed in kilobytes per second.</p>

<p>kB_read The total number of kilobytes read.</p>

<p>kB_wrtn The total number of kilobytes written.</p>

<p>MB_read/s Indicate the amount of data read from the
device expressed in megabytes per second.</p>

<p>MB_wrtn/s Indicate the amount of data written to the
device expressed in megabytes per second.</p>

<p>MB_read The total number of megabytes read.</p>

<p>MB_wrtn The total number of megabytes written.</p>

<p>rrqm/s The number of read requests merged per second
that were queued to the device.</p>

<p>wrqm/s The number of write requests merged per second
that were queued to the device.</p>

<p>r/s The number of read requests that were issued to the
device per second.</p>

<p>w/s The number of write requests that were issued to the
device per second.</p>

<p>rsec/s The number of sectors read from the device per
second.</p>

<p>wsec/s The number of sectors written to the device per
second.</p>

<p>rkB/s The number of kilobytes read from the device per
second.</p>

<p>wkB/s The number of kilobytes written to the device per
second.</p>

<p>rMB/s The number of megabytes read from the device per
second.</p>

<p>wMB/s The number of megabytes written to the device per
second.</p>

<p>avgrq-sz The average size (in sectors) of the requests
that were issued to the device.</p>

<p>avgqu-sz The average queue length of the requests that
were issued to the device.</p>

<p>await The average time (in milliseconds) for I/O
requests issued to the device to be served. This includes
the time spent by the requests in queue and the time spent
servic- ing them.</p>

<p>svctm The average service time (in milliseconds) for I/O
requests that were issued to the device. Warning! Do not
trust this field any more. This field will be removed in a
future sysstat version.</p>

<p>%util Percentage of elapsed time during which I/O
requests were issued to the device (bandwidth utilization
for the device). Device saturation occurs when this value is
close to 100%.</p>

<p>Network Filesystem report The Network Filesystem (NFS)
report provides statistics for each mounted network
filesystem. The report shows the following fields:</p>

<p>Filesystem: This columns shows the hostname of the NFS
server fol- lowed by a colon and by the directory name where
the net- work filesystem is mounted.</p>

<p>rBlk_nor/s Indicate the number of blocks read by
applications via the read(2) system call interface. A block
has a size of 512 bytes.</p>

<p>wBlk_nor/s Indicate the number of blocks written by
applications via the write(2) system call interface.</p>

<p>rBlk_dir/s Indicate the number of blocks read from files
opened with the O_DIRECT flag.</p>

<p>wBlk_dir/s Indicate the number of blocks written to
files opened with the O_DIRECT flag.</p>

<p>rBlk_svr/s Indicate the number of blocks read from the
server by the NFS client via an NFS READ request.</p>

<p>wBlk_svr/s Indicate the number of blocks written to the
server by the NFS client via an NFS WRITE request.</p>

<p>rkB_nor/s Indicate the number of kilobytes read by
applications via the read(2) system call interface.</p>

the server by the NFS client via an NFS WRITE request.</p>

<p>rMB_nor/s Indicate the number of megabytes read by
applications via the read(2) system call interface.</p>

<p>wMB_nor/s Indicate the number of megabytes written by
applications via the write(2) system call interface.</p>

<p>rMB_dir/s Indicate the number of megabytes read from
files opened with the O_DIRECT flag.</p>

<p>wMB_dir/s Indicate the number of megabytes written to
files opened with the O_DIRECT flag.</p>

<p>rMB_svr/s Indicate the number of megabytes read from the
server by the NFS client via an NFS READ request.</p>

<p>wMB_svr/s Indicate the number of megabytes written to
the server by the NFS client via an NFS WRITE request.</p>

<p>ops/s Indicate the number of operations that were issued
to the filesystem per second.</p>

<p>rops/s Indicate the number of read operations that were
issued to the filesystem per second.</p>

<p>wops/s Indicate the number of write operations that were
issued to the filesystem per second.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -c Display the CPU utilization report.</p>

<p>-d Display the device utilization report.</p>

<p>-h Make the NFS report displayed by option -n easier to
read by a human.</p>

<p>-j { ID | LABEL | PATH | UUID | ... } [ device [...] |
ALL ] Display persistent device names. Options ID, LABEL,
etc. specify the type of the persistent name. These options
are not limited, only prerequisite is that directory with
required persistent names is present in /dev/disk.
Optionally, multiple devices can be specified in the chosen
persistent name type.</p>

<p>-k Display statistics in kilobytes per second instead of
blocks per second. Data displayed are valid only with
kernels 2.4 and later.</p>

<p>-m Display statistics in megabytes per second instead of
blocks or kilobytes per second. Data displayed are valid
only with ker- nels 2.4 and later.</p>

<p>-N Display the registered device mapper names for any
device mapper devices. Useful for viewing LVM2
statistics.</p>

<p>-n Display the network filesystem (NFS) report. This
option works only with kernel 2.6.17 and later.</p>

<p>-p [ { device [,...] | ALL } ] The -p option displays
statistics for block devices and all their partitions that
are used by the system. If a device name is entered on the
command line, then statistics for it and all its partitions
are displayed. Last, the ALL keyword indicates that
statistics have to be displayed for all the block devices
and partitions defined by the system, including those that
have never been used. If option -j is defined before this
option, devices entered on the command line can be specified
with the chosen persistent name type. Note that this option
works only with post 2.5 kernels.</p>

<p>-t Print the time for each report displayed. The
timestamp format may depend on the value of the
S_TIME_FORMAT environment vari- able (see below).</p>

<p>-V Print version number then exit.</p>

<p>-x Display extended statistics. This option works with
post 2.5 kernels since it needs /proc/diskstats file or a
mounted sysfs to get the statistics. This option may also
work with older ker- nels (e.g. 2.4) only if extended
statistics are available in /proc/partitions (the kernel
needs to be patched for that).</p>

<p>-y Omit first report with statistics since the system
boot, if dis- playing multiple records in given
interval.</p>

<p>-z Tell iostat to omit output for any devices for which
there was no activity during the sample period.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT The iostat command takes into account the
following environment vari- able:</p>

<p>S_TIME_FORMAT If this variable exists and its value is
ISO then the current locale will be ignored when printing
the date in the report header. The iostat command will use
the ISO 8601 format (YYYY- MM-DD) instead. The timestamp
displayed with option -t will also be compliant with ISO
8601 format.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES iostat Display a single history since boot
report for all CPU and Devices.</p>

<p>iostat -d 2 Display a continuous device report at two
second intervals.</p>

<p>iostat -d 2 6 Display six reports at two second
intervals for all devices.</p>

<p>iostat -x hda hdb 2 6 Display six reports of extended
statistics at two second inter- vals for devices hda and
hdb.</p>

<p>iostat -p sda 2 6 Display six reports at two second
intervals for device sda and all its partitions (sda1,
etc.)</p>

<p>BUGS /proc filesystem must be mounted for iostat to
work.</p>

<p>Extended statistics are available only with post 2.5
kernels.</p>

<p>The average service time (svctm field) value is
meaningless, as I/O statistics are calculated at block
level, and we don t know when the disk driver starts to
process a request. For this reason, this field will be
removed in a future sysstat version.</p>

<p>FILES /proc/stat contains system statistics.</p>

<p>/proc/uptime contains system uptime.</p>

<p>/proc/partitions contains disk statistics (for pre 2.5
kernels that have been patched).</p>

<p>/proc/diskstats contains disks statistics (for post 2.5
kernels).</p>

<p>/sys contains statistics for block devices (post 2.5
kernels).</p>

<p>/proc/self/mountstats contains statistics for network
filesystems.</p>

<p>/dev/disk contains persistent device names.</p>
