<p>UNITS(1) UNITS(1)</p>

<p>NAME units - unit conversion program</p>

<p>OVERVIEW OFUNITS The units program converts quantities
expressed in various scales to their equivalents in other
scales. The units program can handle mul- tiplicative scale
changes as well as nonlinear conversions such as Fahrenheit
to Celsius. Temperature conversions require a special syn-
tax. See the examples below.</p>

<p>The units are defined in an external data file. You can
use the exten- sive data file that comes with this program,
or you can provide your own data file to suit your
needs.</p>

<p>You can use the program interactively with prompts, or
you can use it from the command line.</p>

<p>INTERACTING WITHUNITS To invoke units for interactive
use, type units at your shell prompt. The program will print
something like this:</p>

<p>2131 units, 53 prefixes, 24 nonlinear units</p>

<p>You have:</p>

<p>At the You have: prompt, type the quantity and units
that you are converting from. For example, if you want to
convert ten meters to feet, type 10 meters. Next, units will
print You want:. You should type the type of units you want
to convert to. To convert to feet, you would type feet. Note
that if the readline library was compiled in then the tab
key can be used to complete unit names. See Readline
support, for more information about readline.</p>

<p>The answer will be displayed in two ways. The first line
of output, which is marked with a * to indicate
multiplication, gives the result of the conversion you have
asked for. The second line of output, which is marked with a
/ to indicate division, gives the inverse of the conversion
factor. If you convert 10 meters to feet, units will
print</p>

<p>* 32.808399 / 0.03048</p>

<p>which tells you that 10 meters equals about 32.8 feet.
The second num- ber gives the conversion in the opposite
direction. In this case, it tells you that 1 foot is equal
to about 0.03 dekameters since the dekameter is 10 meters.
It also tells you that 1/32.8 is about .03.</p>

<p>The units program prints the inverse because sometimes
it is a more convenient number. In the example above, for
example, the inverse value is an exact conversion: a foot is
exactly .03048 dekameters. But the number given the other
direction is inexact.</p>

<p>If you try to convert grains to pounds, you will see the
following:</p>

<p>You have: grains You want: pounds * 0.00014285714 /
7000</p>

<p>From the second line of the output you can immediately
see that a grain is equal to a seven thousandth of a pound.
This is not so obvious from the first line of the output. If
you find the output format confus- ing, try using the
--verbose option:</p>

<p>You have: grain You want: aeginamina grain =
0.00010416667 aeginamina grain = (1 / 9600) aeginamina</p>

<p>If you request a conversion between units which measure
reciprocal dimensions, then units will display the
conversion results with an extra note indicating that
reciprocal conversion has been done:</p>

<p>You have: 6 ohms You want: siemens reciprocal conversion
* 0.16666667 / 6</p>

<p>Reciprocal conversion can be suppressed by using the
--strict option. As usual, use the --verbose option to get
more comprehensible output:</p>

<p>You have: tex You want: typp reciprocal conversion 1 /
tex = 496.05465 typp 1 / tex = (1 / 0.0020159069) typp</p>

<p>You have: 20 mph You want: sec/mile reciprocal
conversion 1 / 20 mph = 180 sec/mile 1 / 20 mph = (1 /
0.0055555556) sec/mile</p>

<p>If you enter incompatible unit types, the units program
will print a message indicating that the units are not
conformable and it will dis- play the reduced form for each
unit:</p>

<p>You have: ergs/hour You want: fathoms kg^2 / day
conformability error 2.7777778e-11 kg m^2 / sec^3
2.1166667e-05 kg^2 m / sec</p>

<p>If you only want to find the reduced form or definition
of a unit, sim- ply press return at the You want: prompt.
Here is an example:</p>

<p>You have: jansky You want: Definition: fluxunit = 1e-26
W/m^2 Hz = 1e-26 kg / s^2</p>

<p>The output from units indicates that the jansky is
defined to be equal to a fluxunit which in turn is defined
to be a certain combina- tion of watts, meters, and hertz.
The fully reduced (and in this case somewhat more cryptic)
form appears on the far right.</p>

<p>Some named units are treated as dimensionless in some
situations. These include the radian and steradian. These
units will be treated as equal to 1 in units conversions.
Power is equal to torque times angu- lar velocity. This
conversion can only be performed if the radian is
dimensionless.</p>

<p>You have: (14 ft lbf) (12 radians/sec) You want: watts *
227.77742 / 0.0043902509</p>

<p>Note that named dimensionaless units are not treated as
dimensionless in other contexts. They cannot be used as
exponents so for example, meter^radian is not allowed.</p>

<p>If you want a list of options you can type ? at the You
want: prompt. The program will display a list of named units
which are con- formable with the unit that you entered at
the You have: prompt above. Note that conformable unit
combinations will not appear on this list.</p>

<p>Typing help at either prompt displays a short help
message. You can also type help followed by a unit name.
This will invoke a pager on the units data base at the point
where that unit is defined. You can read the definition and
comments that may give more details or histori- cal
information about the unit.</p>

<p>Typing search text will display a list of all of the
units whose names contain text as a substring along with
their definitions. This may help in the case where you arent
sure of the right unit name.</p>

<p>USINGUNITSNON-INTERACTIVELY The units program can
perform units conversions non-interactively from the command
line. To do this, type the command, type the original units
expression, and type the new units you want. You will
probably need to protect the units expressions from
interpretation by the shell using single quote
characters.</p>

<p>If you type</p>

<p>units 2 liters quarts</p>

<p>then units will print</p>

<p>* 2.1133764 / 0.47317647</p>

<p>and then exit. The output tells you that 2 liters is
about 2.1 quarts, or alternatively that a quart is about
0.47 times 2 liters.</p>

<p>If the conversion is successful, then units will return
success (0) to the calling environment. If units is given
non-conformable units to convert, it will print a message
giving the reduced form of each unit and it will return
failure (nonzero) to the calling environment.</p>

<p>When units is invoked with only one argument, it will
print out the definition of the specified unit. It will
return failure if the unit is not defined and success if the
unit is defined.</p>

<p>UNIT EXPRESSIONS In order to enter more complicated
units or fractions, you will need to use operations such as
powers, products and division. Powers of units can be
specified using the ^ character as shown in the following
example, or by simple concatenation: cm3 is equivalent to
cm^3. If the exponent is more than one digit, the ^ is
required. An exponent like 2^3^2 is evaluated right to left.
The ^ operator has the sec- ond highest precedence. The **
operator is provided as an alterna- tive exponent
operator.</p>

<p>You have: cm^3 You want: gallons * 0.00026417205 /
3785.4118</p>

<p>You have: arabicfoot * arabictradepound * force You
want: ft lbf * 0.7296 / 1.370614</p>

<p>Multiplication of units can be specified by using
spaces, or an aster- isk (*). If units is invoked with the
--product option then the hyphen ( - ) also acts as a
multiplication operator. Division of units is indicated by
the slash (/) or by per.</p>

<p>You have: furlongs per fortnight You want: m/s *
0.00016630986 / 6012.8727</p>

<p>Historically, multiplication in units was assigned a
higher precedence than division. This disagrees with the
usual precedence rules which give multiplication and
division equal precedence, and it has been a source of
confusion for people who think of units as a calculator.</p>

<p>By default, multiplication using the star (*) now has
the same prece- dence as division and hence follows the
usual precedence rules. If units is invoked with the the
--oldstar option then then the old behavior is activated and
* will have the same precedence as the other multiplication
operators described next.</p>

<p>Multiplication using a space or using the hyphen has a
higher prece- dence than division and is evaluated left to
right. So @samp{m/s s/day} is equivalent to m / s s day and
has dimensions of length per time cubed. Similarly, 1/2
meter refers to a unit of reciprocal length equivalent to
.5/meter, which is probably not what you would intend if you
entered that expression.</p>

<p>You can indicate division of numbers with the vertical
dash (|), so if you wanted half a meter you could write
@samp{1|2 meter}. This operator has the highest precedence
so the square root of two thirds could be written
2|3^1|2.</p>

<p>You have: 1|2 inch You want: cm * 1.27 / 0.78740157</p>

<p>Parentheses can be used for grouping as desired.</p>

<p>You have: (1/2) kg / (kg/meter) You want: league *
0.00010356166 / 9656.0833</p>

<p>Prefixes are defined separately from base units. In
order to get cen- timeters, the units database defines
centi- and c- as prefixes. Prefixes can appear alone with no
unit following them. An exponent applies only to the
immediately preceding unit and its prefix so that cm^3 or
centimeter^3 refer to cubic centimeters but centi*meter^3
refers to hundredths of cubic meters. Only one prefix is
permitted per unit, so micromicrofarad will fail, but
micro*microfarad will work, as will micro microfarad..</p>

<p>For units , numbers are just another kind of unit. They
can appear as many times as you like and in any order in a
unit expression. For example, to find the volume of a box
which is 2 ft by 3 ft by 12 ft in steres, you could do the
following:</p>

<p>You have: 2 ft 3 ft 12 ft You want: stere * 2.038813 /
0.49048148</p>

<p>You have: $ 5 / yard You want: cents / inch * 13.888889
/ 0.072</p>

<p>And the second example shows how the dollar sign in the
units conver- sion can precede the five. Be careful: units
will interpret $5 with no space as equivalent to
dollars^5.</p>

<p>Outside of the SI system, it is often desirable to add
values of dif- ferent units together. You may also wish to
use units as a calcula- tor that keeps track of units. Sums
of conformable units are written with the + character.</p>

<p>You have: 2 hours + 23 minutes + 32 seconds You want:
seconds * 8612 / 0.00011611705</p>

<p>You have: 12 ft + 3 in You want: cm * 373.38 /
0.0026782366</p>

<p>You have: 2 btu + 450 ft lbf You want: btu * 2.5782804 /
0.38785542</p>

<p>The expressions which are added together must reduce to
identical expressions in primitive units, or an error
message will be displayed:</p>

<p>You have: 12 printerspoint + 4 heredium ^ Illegal sum of
non-conformable units</p>

<p>Historically - has been used for products of units,
which complicates its iterpretation in units . Because units
provides several other ways to obtain unit products, and
because - is a subtraction operator in general algebraic
expressions, units treats the binary - as a subtraction
operator by default. This behavior can be altered using the
--product option which causes units to treat the binary -
operator as a product operator. Note that when - is a
multiplication operator it has the same precedence as *, but
when - is a subtrac- tion operator it has the lower
precedence as the addition operator.</p>

<p>When - is used as a unary operator it negates its
operand. Regard- less of the units options, if - appears
after ( or after + then it will act as a negation operator.
So you can always compute 20 degrees minus 12 minutes by
entering 20 degrees + -12 arcmin. You must use this
construction when you define new units because you cannot
know what options will be in force when your definition is
processed.</p>

<p>The + character sometimes appears in exponents like
3.43e+8. This leads to an ambiguity in an expression like
3e+2 yC. The unit e is a small unit of charge, so this can
be regarded as equivalent to (3e+2) yC or (3 e)+(2 yC). This
ambiguity is resolved by always interpreting + as part of an
exponent if possible.</p>

<p>Several built in functions are provided: sin, cos, tan ,
ln, log, log2, exp, acos, atan and asin. The sin, cos, and
tan functions require either a dimensionless argument or an
argument with dimensions of angle.</p>

<p>You have: sin(30 degrees) You want: Definition: 0.5</p>

<p>You have: sin(pi/2) You want: Definition: 1</p>

<p>You have: sin(3 kg) ^ Unit not dimensionless</p>

<p>The other functions on the list require dimensionless
arguments. The inverse trigonometric functions return
arguments with dimensions of angle.</p>

<p>If you wish to take roots of units, you may use the sqrt
or cube- root functions. These functions require that the
argument have the appropriate root. Higher roots can be
obtained by using fractional exponents:</p>

<p>You have: sqrt(acre) You want: feet * 208.71074 /
0.0047913202</p>

<p>You have: (400 W/m^2 / stefanboltzmann)^(1/4) You have:
Definition: 289.80882 K</p>

<p>You have: cuberoot(hectare) ^ Unit not a root</p>

<p>Nonlinear units are represented using functional
notation. They make possible nonlinear unit conversions such
temperature. This is differ- ent from the linear units that
convert temperature differences. Note the difference below.
The absolute temperature conversions are handled by units
starting with temp , and you must use functional notation.
The temperature differences are done using units starting
with deg and they do not require functional notation.</p>

<p>You have: tempF(45) You want: tempC 7.2222222</p>

<p>You have: 45 degF You want: degC * 25 / 0.04</p>

<p>Think of tempF(x) not as a function but as a notation
which indicates that x should have units of tempF attached
to it. See Nonlinear units. The first conversion shows that
if its 45 degrees Fahrenheit outside it s 7.2 degrees
Celsius. The second conversions indicates that a change of
45 degrees Fahrenheit corresponds to a change of 25 degrees
Celsius.</p>

<p>Some other examples of nonlinears units are ring size
and wire gauge. There are numerous different gauges and ring
sizes. See the units database for more details. Note that
wire gauges with multiple zeroes are signified using
negative numbers where two zeroes is -1. Alterna- tively,
you can use the synonyms g00, g000, and so on that are
defined in the units database.</p>

<p>You have: wiregauge(11) You want: inches * 0.090742002 /
11.020255</p>

<p>You have: brwiregauge(g00) You want: inches * 0.348 /
2.8735632</p>

<p>You have: 1 mm You want: wiregauge 18.201919</p>

<p>INVOKINGUNITS You invoke units like this:</p>

<p>units [OPTIONS] [FROM-UNIT [TO-UNIT]]</p>

<p>If the FROM-UNIT and TO-UNIT are omitted, then the
program will use interactive prompts to determine which
conversions to perform. See Interactive use. If both
FROM-UNIT and TO-UNIT are given, units will print the result
of that single conversion and then exit. If only FROM-UNIT
appears on the command line, units will display the defini-
tion of that unit and exit. Units specified on the command
line will need to be quoted to protect them from shell
interpretation and to group them into two arguments. See
Command line use.</p>

<p>The following options allow you to read in an
alternative units file, check your units file, or change the
output format:</p>

<p>-c, --check Check that all units and prefixes defined in
the units data file reduce to primitive units. Print a list
of all units that can- not be reduced. Also display some
other diagnostics about sus- picious definitions in the
units data file. Note that only def- initions active in the
current locale are checked.</p>

<p>--check-verbose Like the -check option, this option
prints a list of units that cannot be reduced. But to help
find unit definitions that cause endless loops, it lists the
units as they are checked. If units hangs, then the last
unit to be printed has a bad defi- nition. Note that only
definitions active in the current locale are checked.</p>

<p>-o format, --output-format format Use the specified
format for numeric output. Format is the same as that for
the printf function in the ANSI C standard. For example, if
you want more precision you might use -o %.15g.</p>

<p>-f filename, --file filename Instruct units to load the
units file filename . If file- name is the empty string (-f
&quot;) then the default units file will be loaded. This
enables you to load the default file plus a personal units
file. Up to 25 units files may be specified on the command
line. This option overrides the UNITSFILE envi- ronment
variable.</p>

<p>-h, --help Print out a summary of the options for
units.</p>

<p>-m, --minus Causes - to be interpreted as a subtraction
operator. This is usually the default behavior.</p>

<p>-p, --product Causes - to be interpreted as a
multiplication operator when it has two operands. It will as
a negation operator when it has only one operand: (-3). Note
that by default - is treated as a subtraction operator.</p>

<p>, --oldstar Causes * to have the old style precedence,
higher than the precedence of division so that 1/2*3 will
equal 6.</p>

<p>, --newstar Forces * to have the new (default)
precedence which fol- lows the usual rules of algebra: the
precedence of * is the same as the precedence of /, so that
1/2*3 will equal 3/2.</p>

<p>, --compact Give compact output featuring only the
conversion factor. This turns off the --verbose option.</p>

<p>-q, --quiet, --silent Suppress prompting of the user for
units and the display of statistics about the number of
units loaded.</p>

<p>-s, --strict Suppress conversion of units to their
reciprocal units. For example, units will normally convert
hertz to seconds because these units are reciprocals of each
other. The strict option requires that units be strictly
conformable to perform a conver- sion, and will give an
error if you attempt to convert hertz to seconds.</p>

<p>-1, --one-line Give only one line of output (the forward
conversion). Do not print the reverse conversion. Note that
if a reciprocal conver- sion is performed then units will
print still print the &quot;reciprocal conversion&quot;
line.</p>

<p>-t, --terse Give terse output when converting units.
This option can be used when calling units from another
program so that the out- put is easy to parse. This option
has the combined effect of these options: --strict --quiet
--one-line --compact.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose Give slightly more verbose output when
converting units. When combined with the -c option this
gives the same effect as --check-verbose.</p>

<p>-V, --version Print program version number, tell whether
the readline library has been included, and give the
location of the default units data file.</p>

<p>UNIT DEFINITIONS The conversion information is read from
a units data file which is called units.dat and is probably
located in the /usr/local/share directory. If you invoke
units with the -V option, it will print the location of this
file. The default file includes definitions for all familiar
units, abbreviations and metric prefixes. It also includes
many obscure or archaic units.</p>

<p>Many constants of nature are defined, including
these:</p>

<p>pi ratio of circumference to diameter c speed of light e
charge on an electron force acceleration of gravity mole
Avogadros number water pressure per unit height of water Hg
pressure per unit height of mercury au astronomical unit k
Boltzmans constant mu0 permeability of vacuum epsilon0
permitivity of vacuum G gravitational constant mach speed of
sound The database includes atomic masses for all of the
elements and numer- ous other constants. Also included are
the densities of various ingre- dients used in baking so
that 2 cups flour_sifted can be converted to grams. This is
not an exhaustive list. Consult the units data file to see
the complete list, or to see the definitions that are
used.</p>

<p>The unit pound is a unit of mass. To get force, multiply
by the force conversion unit force or use the shorthand lbf.
(Note that g is already taken as the standard abbreviation
for the gram.) The unit ounce is also a unit of mass. The
fluid ounce is fluidounce or floz. British capacity units
that differ from their US counter- parts, such as the
British Imperial gallon, are prefixed with br. Currency is
prefixed with its country name: belgiumfranc, britain-
pound.</p>

<p>The US Survey foot, yard, and mile can be obtained by
using the US prefix. These units differ slightly from the
international length units. They were in general use until
1959, and are still used for geographic surveys. The acre is
officially defined in terms of the US Survey foot. If you
want an acre defined according to the interna- tional foot,
use intacre. The difference between these units is about 4
parts per million. The British also used a slightly
different length measure before 1959. These can be obtained
with the prefix UK.</p>

<p>When searching for a unit, if the specified string does
not appear exactly as a unit name, then the units program
will try to remove a trailing s or a trailing es. If that
fails, units will check for a prefix. All of the standard
metric prefixes are defined.</p>

<p>To find out what units and prefixes are available, read
the standard units data file.</p>

<p>DEFINING NEW UNITS All of the units and prefixes that
units can convert are defined in the units data file. If you
want to add your own units, you can supply your own file.
You can also add your own units definitions in the
.units.dat file in your home directory. If this file exists
it is read before the units data file. It will not be read
if any units files are specified on the command line.</p>

<p>A unit is specified on a single line by giving its name
and an equiva- lence. Comments start with a # character,
which can appear anywhere in a line. The backslash character
( &acute;) acts as a continuation charac- ter if it appears
as the last character on a line, making it possible to
spread definitions out over several lines if desired. A file
can be included by giving the command !include followed by
the files name. The file will be sought in the same
directory as the parent file unless a full path is
given.</p>

<p>Unit names must not contain any of the operator
characters +, -, * , /, |, ^ or the parentheses. They cannot
begin with a digit or a decimal point (.), nor can they end
with a digit (except for zero). Be careful to define new
units in terms of old ones so that a reduction leads to the
primitive units, which are marked with ! char- acters.
Dimensionless units are indicated by using the string
!dimen- sionless for the unit definition.</p>

<p>When adding new units, be sure to use the -c option to
check that the new units reduce properly. If you create a
loop in the units defini- tions, then units will hang when
invoked with the -c options. You will need to use the
--check-verbose option which prints out each unit as it
checks them. The program will still hang, but the last unit
printed will be the unit which caused the infinite loop.</p>

<p>If you define any units which contain + characters,
carefully check them because the -c option will not catch
non-conformable sums. Be careful with the - operator as
well. When used as a binary operator, the - character can
perform addition or multiplication depending on the options
used to invoke units. To ensure consistent behavior use -
only as a unary negation operator when writing units
definitions. To multiply two units leave a space or use the
* operator with care, recalling that it has two possible
precedence values and may require parentheses to ensure
consistent behavior. To compute the difference of foo and
bar write foo+(-bar) or even foo+-bar.</p>

<p>Here is an example of a short units file that defines
some basic units:</p>

<p>m ! # The meter is a primitive unit sec ! # The second
is a primitive unit rad !dimensionless # The second is a
primitive unit micro- 1e-6 # Define a prefix minute 60 sec #
A minute is 60 seconds hour 60 min # An hour is 60 minutes
inch 0.0254 m # Inch defined in terms of meters ft 12 inches
# The foot defined in terms of inches mile 5280 ft # And the
mile</p>

<p>A unit which ends with a - character is a prefix. If a
prefix definition contains any / characters, be sure they
are protected by parentheses. If you define half- 1/2 then
halfmeter would be equivalent to 1 / 2 meter.</p>

<p>DEFINING NONLINEAR UNITS Some units conversions of
interest are nonlinear; for example, tempera- ture
conversions between the Fahrenheit and Celsius scales cannot
be done by simply multiplying by conversions factors.</p>

<p>When you give a linear unit definition such as inch 2.54
cm you are providing information that units uses to convert
values in inches into primitive units of meters. For
nonlinear units, you give a func- tional definition that
provides the same information.</p>

<p>Nonlinear units are represented using a functional
notation. It is best to regard this notation not as a
function call but as a way of adding units to a number, much
the same way that writing a linear unit name after a number
adds units to that number. Internally, nonlinear units are
defined by a pair of functions which convert to and from
lin- ear units in the data file, so that an eventual
conversion to primitive units is possible.</p>

<p>Here is an example nonlinear unit definition:</p>

<p>tempF(x) [1;K] (x+(-32)) degF + stdtemp ;
(tempF+(-stdtemp))/degF + 32</p>

<p>A nonlinear unit definition comprises a unit name, a
dummy parameter name, two functions, and two corresponding
units. The functions tell units how to convert to and from
the new unit. In order to produce valid results, the
arguments of these functions need to have the cor- rect
dimensions. To facilitate error checking, you may specify
the dimensions.</p>

<p>The definition begins with the unit name followed
immediately (with no spaces) by a ( character. In
parentheses is the name of the parame- ter. Next is an
optional specification of the units required by the
functions in this definition. In the example above, the
tempF func- tion requires an input argument conformable with
1. For normal non- linear units definitions the forward
function will always take a dimen- sionless argument. The
inverse function requires an input argument conformable with
K. In general the inverse function will need units that
match the quantity measured by your nonlinear unit. The sole
pur- pose of the expression in brackets to enable units to
perform error checking on function arguments.</p>

<p>Next the function definitions appear. In the example
above, the tempF function is defined by</p>

<p>tempF(x) = (x+(-32)) degF + stdtemp</p>

<p>This gives a rule for converting x in the units tempF to
linear units of absolute temperature, which makes it
possible to convert from tempF to other units.</p>

<p>In order to make conversions to Fahrenheit possible, you
must give a rule for the inverse conversions. The inverse
will be x(tempF) and its definition appears after a ;
character. In our example, the inverse is</p>

<p>x(tempF) = (tempF+(-stdtemp))/degF + 32</p>

<p>This inverse definition takes an absolute temperature as
its argument and converts it to the Fahrenheit temperature.
The inverse can be omitted by leaving out the ; character,
but then conversions to the unit will be impossible. If the
inverse is omitted then the --check option will display a
warning. It is up to you to calculate and enter the correct
inverse function to obtain proper conversions. The --check
option tests the inverse at one point and print an error if
it is not valid there, but this is not a guarantee that your
inverse is correct.</p>

<p>If you wish to make synonyms for nonlinear units, you
still need to define both the forward and inverse functions.
Inverse functions can be obtained using the ~ operator. So
to create a synonym for tempF you could write</p>

<p>fahrenheit(x) [1;K] tempF(x); ~tempF(fahrenheit)</p>

<p>You may occasionally wish to define a function that
operates on units. This can be done using a nonlinear unit
definition. For example, the definition below provides
conversion between radius and the area of a circle. Note
that this definition requires a length as input and pro-
duces an area as output, as indicated by the specification
in brackets.</p>

<p>circlearea(r) [m;m^2] pi r^2 ; sqrt(circlearea/pi)</p>

<p>Sometimes you may be interested in a piecewise linear
unit such as many wire gauges. Piecewise linear units can be
defined by specifying con- versions to linear units on a
list of points. Conversion at other points will be done by
linear interpolation. A partial definition of zinc gauge
is</p>

<p>zincgauge[in] 1 0.002, 10 0.02, 15 0.04, 19 0.06, 23
0.1</p>

<p>In this example, zincgauge is the name of the piecewise
linear unit. The definition of such a unit is indicated by
the embedded [ charac- ter. After the bracket, you should
indicate the units to be attached to the numbers in the
table. No spaces can appear before the ] char- acter, so a
definition like foo[kg meters] is illegal; instead write
foo[kg*meters] . The definition of the unit consists of a
list of pairs optionally separated by commas. This list
defines a function for converting from the piecewise linear
unit to linear units. The first item in each pair is the
function argument; the second item is the value of the
function at that argument (in the units specified in
brackets). In this example, we define zincgauge at five
points. For example, we set zincgauge(1) equal to 0.002 in.
Definitions like this may be more readable if written using
continuation characters as zincgauge[in] 1 0.002 10 0.02 15
0.04 19 0.06 23 0.1</p>

<p>With the preceeding definition, the following conversion
can be per- formed:</p>

<p>You have: zincgauge(10) You want: in * 0.02 / 50 You
have: .01 inch You want: zincgauge 5</p>

<p>If you define a piecewise linear unit that is not
strictly monotonic, then the inverse will not be well
defined. If the inverse is requested for such a unit, units
will return the smallest inverse. The --check option will
print a warning if a non-monotonic piecewise lin- ear unit
is encountered.</p>

<p>LOCALIZATION Some units have different values in
different locations. The localiza- tion feature accomodates
this by allowing the units database to specify region
dependent definitions. A locale region in the units database
begins with !locale followed by the name of the locale. The
leading ! must appear in the first column of the units
database. The locale region is terminated by !endlocale .
The following example shows how to define a couple units in
a locale.</p>

<p>!locale en_GB ton brton gallon brgallon !endlocale</p>

<p>The current locale is specified by the LOCALE
environment variable. Note that the -c option only checks
the definitions which are active for the current locale.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The units programs uses the
following environment variables.</p>

<p>LOCALE Specifies the locale. The default is en_US .
Sections of the units database are specific to certain
locales.</p>

<p>PAGER Specifies the pager to use for help and for
displaying the con- formable units. The help function
browses the units database and calls the pager using the +nn
syntax for specifying a line number. The default pager is
more , but less , emacs, or vi are possible
alternatives.</p>

<p>UNITSFILE Specifies the units database file to use
(instead of the default). This will be overridden by the -f
option. Note that you can only specify a single units
database using this environ- ment variable.</p>

<p>READLINE SUPPORT If the readline package has been
compiled in, then when units is used interactively, numerous
command line editing features are avail- able. To check if
your version of units includes the readline, invoke the
program with the --version option.</p>

<p>For complete information about readline, consult the
documentation for the readline package. Without any
configuration, units will allow editing in the style of
emacs. Of particular use with units are the completion
commands.</p>

<p>If you type a few characters and then hit ESC followed
by the ? key then units will display a list of all the units
which start with the characters typed. For example, if you
type metr and then request completion, you will see
something like this:</p>

<p>You have: metr metre metriccup metrichorsepower
metrictenth metretes metricfifth metricounce metricton
metriccarat metricgrain metricquart metricyarncount You
have: metr</p>

<p>If there is a unique way to complete a unitname, you can
hit the tab key and units will provide the rest of the unit
name. If units beeps, it means that there is no unique
completion. Pressing the tab key a second time will print
the list of all completions.</p>
