<p>SLABTOP(1) Linux User s Manual SLABTOP(1)</p>

<p>NAME slabtop - display kernel slab cache information in
real time</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS slabtop [ options ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION slabtop(1) displays detailed kernel slab
cache information in real time. It displays a listing of the
top caches sorted by one of the listed sort criteria. It
also displays a statistics header filled with slab layer
information.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Normal invocation of slabtop(1) does not require
any options. The behavior, however, can be fine-tuned by
specifying one or more of the following flags:</p>

<p>--delay=n, -d n Refresh the display every n seconds. By
default, slabtop(1) refreshes the display every three
seconds. To exit the program, hit q.</p>

<p>--sort=S, -s S Sort by S, where S is one of the sort
criteria.</p>

<p>--once, -o Display the output once and then exit.</p>

<p>--version, -V Display version information and exit.</p>

<p>--help Display usage information and exit.</p>

<p>SORT CRITERIA The following are valid sort criteria used
to sort the individual slab caches and thereby determine
what are the &quot;top&quot; slab caches to display. The
default sort criteria is to sort by the number of objects
(&quot;o&quot;).</p>

<p>The sort criteria can also be changed while slabtop is
running by pressing the associated character.</p>

<p>a: sort by number of active objects</p>

<p>b: sort by objects per slab</p>

<p>c: sort by cache size</p>

<p>l: sort by number of slabs</p>

<p>v sort by number of active slabs</p>

<p>n: sort by name</p>

<p>o: sort by number of objects</p>

<p>p: sort by pages per slab</p>

<p>s: sort by object size</p>

<p>u: sort by cache utilization</p>

<p>COMMANDS slabtop(1) accepts keyboard commands from the
user during use. The following are supported. In the case of
letters, both cases are accepted.</p>

<p>Each of the valid sort characters are also accepted, to
change the sort routine. See the section SORT CRITERIA.</p>

<p>&lt;SPACEBAR&gt; Refresh the screen.</p>

<p>Q Quit the program.</p>

<p>FILES /proc/slabinfo -- slab information</p>

<p>SEE ALSO free(1), ps(1), top(1), vmstat(8)</p>

<p>NOTES Currently, slabtop(1) requires a 2.4 or later
kernel (specifically, a version 1.1 or later
/proc/slabinfo). Kernel 2.2 should be supported in the
future.</p>

<p>The slabtop statistic header is tracking how many bytes
of slabs are being used and it not a measure of physical
memory. The Slab field in the /proc/meminfo file is tracking
information about used slab physical memory.</p>

<p>slabtop(1) was inspired by Martin Blighs perl script,
vmtop. The procps package is maintained by Albert Cahalan
