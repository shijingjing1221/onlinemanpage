<p>avc_has_perm(3) SELinux API documentation
avc_has_perm(3)</p>

<p>NAME avc_has_perm, avc_has_perm_noaudit, avc_audit,
avc_entry_ref_init - obtain and audit SELinux access
decisions.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;selinux/selinux.h&gt;</p>

<p>#include &lt;selinux/avc.h&gt;</p>

<p>void avc_entry_ref_init(struct avc_entry_ref
*aeref);</p>

<p>int avc_has_perm(security_id_t ssid, security_id_t tsid,
security_class_t tclass, access_vector_t requested,</p>

<p>struct avc_entry_ref *aeref, void *auditdata);</p>

<p>int avc_has_perm_noaudit(security_id_t ssid,
security_id_t tsid, security_class_t tclass, access_vector_t
requested,</p>

<p>struct avc_entry_ref *aeref, struct av_decision
*avd);</p>

<p>void avc_audit(security_id_t ssid, security_id_t tsid,
security_class_t tclass, access_vector_t requested,</p>

<p>struct av_decision *avd, int result, void
*auditdata);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION avc_entry_ref_init initializes an
avc_entry_ref structure; see ENTRY REFERENCES below. This
function may be implemented as a macro.</p>

<p>avc_has_perm checks whether the requested permissions
are granted for subject SID ssid and target SID tsid,
interpreting the permissions based on tclass and updating
aeref, if non-NULL, to refer to a cache entry with the
resulting decision. The granting or denial of permis- sions
is audited in accordance with the policy. The auditdata
parame- ter is for supplemental auditing; see avc_audit
below.</p>

<p>avc_has_perm_noaudit behaves as avc_has_perm without
producing an audit message. The access decision is returned
in avd and can be passed to avc_audit explicitly.</p>

<p>avc_audit produces an audit message for the access query
represented by ssid, tsid, tclass, and requested, with a
decision represented by avd. Pass the value returned by
avc_has_perm_noaudit as result. The audit- data parameter is
passed to the user-supplied func_audit callback and can be
used to add supplemental information to the audit message;
see avc_init(3).</p>

<p>ENTRY REFERENCES Entry references can be used to speed
cache performance for repeated queries on the same subject
and target. The userspace AVC will check the aeref argument,
if supplied, before searching the cache on a per- mission
query. After a query is performed, aeref will be updated to
reference the cache entry for that query. A subsequent query
on the same subject and target will then have the decision
at hand without having to walk the cache.</p>

<p>After declaring an avc_entry_ref structure, use
avc_entry_ref_init to initialize it before passing it to
avc_has_perm or avc_has_perm_noaudit for the first time.
Using an uninitialized structure will produce undefined
behavior.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE If requested permissions are granted, zero
is returned. If requested permissions are denied or an error
occured, -1 is returned and errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>In permissive mode, zero will be returned and errno
unchanged even if permissions were denied. avc_has_perm will
still produce an audit mes- sage in this case.</p>

<p>ERRORS EACCES A requested permission was denied.</p>

<p>EINVAL The tclass and/or the security contexts
referenced by ssid and tsid are not recognized by the
currently loaded policy.</p>

<p>ENOMEM An attempt to allocate memory failed.</p>

<p>NOTES Internal errors encountered by the userspace AVC
may cause certain val- ues of errno to be returned
unexpectedly. For example, netlink socket errors may produce
EACCES or EINVAL. Make sure that userspace object managers
are granted appropriate access to netlink by the policy.</p>
