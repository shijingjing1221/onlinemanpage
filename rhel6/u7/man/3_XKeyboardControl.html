<p>XChangeKeyboardControl(3) XLIB FUNCTIONS
XChangeKeyboardControl(3)</p>

<p>NAME XChangeKeyboardControl, XGetKeyboardControl,
XAutoRepeatOn, XAutoRe- peatOff, XBell, XQueryKeymap,
XKeyboardControl - manipulate keyboard settings and keyboard
control structure</p>

<p>SYNTAX int XChangeKeyboardControl(Display *display,
unsigned long value_mask, XKeyboardControl *values);</p>

<p>int XGetKeyboardControl(Display *display, XKeyboardState
*val- ues_return);</p>

<p>int XAutoRepeatOn(Display *display);</p>

<p>int XAutoRepeatOff(Display *display);</p>

<p>int XBell(Display *display, int percent);</p>

<p>int XQueryKeymap(Display *display, char
keys_return[32]);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS display Specifies the connection to the X
server.</p>

<p>keys_return Returns an array of bytes that identifies
which keys are pressed down. Each bit represents one key of
the keyboard.</p>

<p>percent Specifies the volume for the bell, which can
range from -100 to 100 inclusive.</p>

<p>value_mask Specifies which controls to change. This mask
is the bitwise inclusive OR of the valid control mask
bits.</p>

<p>values Specifies one value for each bit set to 1 in the
mask.</p>

<p>values_return Returns the current keyboard controls in
the specified XKey- boardState structure.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The XChangeKeyboardControl function controls
the keyboard characteris- tics defined by the
XKeyboardControl structure. The value_mask argu- ment
specifies which values are to be changed.</p>

<p>XChangeKeyboardControl can generate BadMatch and
BadValue errors.</p>

<p>The XGetKeyboardControl function returns the current
control values for the keyboard to the XKeyboardState
structure.</p>

<p>The XAutoRepeatOn function turns on auto-repeat for the
keyboard on the specified display.</p>

<p>The XAutoRepeatOff function turns off auto-repeat for
the keyboard on the specified display.</p>

<p>The XBell function rings the bell on the keyboard on the
specified dis- play, if possible. The specified volume is
relative to the base volume for the keyboard. If the value
for the percent argument is not in the range -100 to 100
inclusive, a BadValue error results. The volume at which the
bell rings when the percent argument is nonnegative is:</p>

<p>base - [(base * percent) / 100] + percent</p>

<p>The volume at which the bell rings when the percent
argument is nega- tive is:</p>

<p>base + [(base * percent) / 100]</p>

<p>To change the base volume of the bell, use
XChangeKeyboardControl.</p>

<p>XBell can generate a BadValue error.</p>

<p>The XQueryKeymap function returns a bit vector for the
logical state of the keyboard, where each bit set to 1
indicates that the corresponding key is currently pressed
down. The vector is represented as 32 bytes. Byte N (from 0)
contains the bits for keys 8N to 8N + 7 with the least
significant bit in the byte representing key 8N.</p>

<p>Note that the logical state of a device (as seen by
client applica- tions) may lag the physical state if device
event processing is frozen.</p>

<p>STRUCTURES The XKeyboardControl structure contains:</p>

<p>/* Mask bits for ChangeKeyboardControl */</p>

<p>#define KBKeyClickPercent (1L&lt;&lt;0) #define
KBBellPercent (1L&lt;&lt;1) #define KBBellPitch
(1L&lt;&lt;2) #define KBBellDuration (1L&lt;&lt;3) #define
KBLed (1L&lt;&lt;4) #define KBLedMode (1L&lt;&lt;5) #define
KBKey (1L&lt;&lt;6) #define KBAutoRepeatMode (1L&lt;&lt;7)
/* Values */</p>

<p>typedef struct { int key_click_percent; int
bell_percent; int bell_pitch; int bell_duration; int led;
int led_mode; /* LedModeOn, LedModeOff */ int key; int
auto_repeat_mode; /* AutoRepeatModeOff, AutoRepeatModeOn,
AutoRepeatModeDefault */ } XKeyboardControl;</p>

<p>The key_click_percent member sets the volume for key
clicks between 0 (off) and 100 (loud) inclusive, if
possible. A setting of -1 restores the default. Other
negative values generate a BadValue error.</p>

<p>The bell_percent sets the base volume for the bell
between 0 (off) and 100 (loud) inclusive, if possible. A
setting of -1 restores the default. Other negative values
generate a BadValue error. The bell_pitch member sets the
pitch (specified in Hz) of the bell, if pos- sible. A
setting of -1 restores the default. Other negative values
generate a BadValue error. The bell_duration member sets the
duration of the bell specified in milliseconds, if possible.
A setting of -1 restores the default. Other negative values
generate a BadValue error.</p>

<p>If both the led_mode and led members are specified, the
state of that LED is changed, if possible. The led_mode
member can be set to LedMod- eOn or LedModeOff. If only
led_mode is specified, the state of all LEDs are changed, if
possible. At most 32 LEDs numbered from one are supported.
No standard interpretation of LEDs is defined. If led is
specified without led_mode, a BadMatch error results.</p>

<p>If both the auto_repeat_mode and key members are
specified, the auto_repeat_mode of that key is changed
(according to AutoRepeatModeOn, AutoRepeatModeOff, or
AutoRepeatModeDefault), if possible. If only
auto_repeat_mode is specified, the global auto_repeat_mode
for the entire keyboard is changed, if possible, and does
not affect the per- key settings. If a key is specified
without an auto_repeat_mode, a BadMatch error results. Each
key has an individual mode of whether or not it should
auto-repeat and a default setting for the mode. In addi-
tion, there is a global mode of whether auto-repeat should
be enabled or not and a default setting for that mode. When
global mode is AutoRepeatModeOn, keys should obey their
individual auto-repeat modes. When global mode is
AutoRepeatModeOff, no keys should auto-repeat. An
auto-repeating key generates alternating KeyPress and
KeyRelease events. When a key is used as a modifier, it is
desirable for the key not to auto-repeat, regardless of its
auto-repeat setting.</p>

<p>The XKeyboardState structure contains:</p>

<p>typedef struct { int key_click_percent; int
bell_percent; unsigned int bell_pitch, bell_duration;
unsigned long led_mask; int global_auto_repeat; char
auto_repeats[32]; } XKeyboardState;</p>

<p>For the LEDs, the least significant bit of led_mask
corresponds to LED one, and each bit set to 1 in led_mask
indicates an LED that is lit. The global_auto_repeat member
can be set to AutoRepeatModeOn or AutoRe- peatModeOff. The
auto_repeats member is a bit vector. Each bit set to 1
indicates that auto-repeat is enabled for the corresponding
key. The vector is represented as 32 bytes. Byte N (from 0)
contains the bits for keys 8N to 8N + 7 with the least
significant bit in the byte repre- senting key 8N.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS BadMatch Some argument or pair of arguments
has the correct type and range but fails to match in some
other way required by the request.</p>

<p>BadValue Some numeric value falls outside the range of
values accepted by the request. Unless a specific range is
specified for an argument, the full range defined by the
argument s type is accepted. Any argument defined as a set
of alternatives can generate this error.</p>
