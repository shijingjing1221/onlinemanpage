<p>NAME unwrapdiff - demangle word-wrapped patches</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS unwrapdiff [-v] [file...]</p>

<p>unwrapdiff {[--help] | [--version]}</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION unwrapdiff demangles patches that have been
word-wrapped, in an attempt to make them useful.</p>

<p>The corrected diff is sent to standard output. Note that
you will probably need to use the -l option when applying
the patch, in order to ignore any whitespace differences
there may be.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -v Verbose operation. A list of lines that are
modified in a way that might be wrong is sent to stderr.</p>

<p>--help Display a short usage message.</p>

<p>--version Display the version number of unwrapdiff.</p>

<p>LIMITATIONS Some heuristics are used to decide whether
use a space to recombine a wrapped line, or just join them
together. Currently this is done by comparing with last
three characters of a line with the first two characters of
its continuation, and using a space if any of them are
different.</p>

<p>The patch needs to have been valid before being
word-wrapped.</p>

<p>The last line of a hunk is nearly always ambiguous. If
the next line begins @@, Index: , diff or --- then it is
taken to be complete; otherwise it is unwrapped using the
next line.</p>
