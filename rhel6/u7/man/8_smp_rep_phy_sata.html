<p>NAME smp_rep_phy_sata - invoke REPORT PHY SATA SMP
function</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS smp_rep_phy_sata [--affiliation=AC] [--help]
[--hex] [--inter- face=PARAMS] [--phy=ID] [--raw]
[--sa=SAS_ADDR] [--verbose] [--version] SMP_DEVICE[,N]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Sends a SAS Management Protocol (SMP) REPORT
PHY SATA request function to a SMP target. The SMP target is
identified by the SMP_DEVICE and the SAS_ADDR. Depending on
the interface, the SAS_ADDR may be deduced from the
SMP_DEVICE. With one interface there is one SMP_DEVICE per
machine so the SMP_DEVICE,N syntax is needed to
differentiate between HBAs if there are multiple
present.</p>

<p>-a, --affiliation=AC where AC is the affiliation context
relative identifier that is placed in request (new in
sas2r08). Defaults to 0.</p>

<p>-h, --help output the usage message then exit.</p>

<p>-H, --hex output the response in hexadecimal.</p>

<p>-I, --interface=PARAMS interface specific parameters. In
this case &quot;interface&quot; refers to the path through
the operating system to the SMP initiator. See the smp_utils
man page for more information.</p>

<p>-p, --phy=ID phy identifier. ID is a value between 0 and
127. Default is 0.</p>

<p>-r, --raw send the response to stdout in binary. All
error messages are sent to stderr.</p>

<p>-s, --sa=SAS_ADDR specifies the SAS address of the SMP
target device. Typically this is an expander. This option
may not be needed if the SMP_DEVICE has the targets SAS
address within it. The SAS_ADDR is in decimal but most SAS
addresses are shown in hexadecimal. To give a number in
hexadecimal either prefix it with 0x or put a trailing h on
it.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose increase the verbosity of the output. Can
be used multiple times</p>

<p>-V, --version print the version string and then
exit.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO The SMP REPORT PHY SATA function was
introduced in SAS-1 . The &quot;Expander change count&quot;,
&quot;STP I_T nexus loss occurred&quot; and several other
fields were added in SAS-2 .</p>
