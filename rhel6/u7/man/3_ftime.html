<p>FTIME(3) Linux Programmer s Manual FTIME(3)</p>

<p>NAME ftime - return date and time</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/timeb.h&gt;</p>

<p>int ftime(struct timeb *tp);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This function returns the current time, in
seconds and milliseconds since the Epoch (00:00:00 UTC, 1
January 1970). The time is returned in tp, which is declared
as follows:</p>

<p>struct timeb { time_t time; unsigned short millitm;
short timezone; short dstflag; };</p>

<p>Here time is the number of seconds since the Epoch, and
millitm is the number of milliseconds since time seconds
since the Epoch. The time- zone field is the local timezone
measured in minutes of time west of Greenwich (with a
negative value indicating minutes east of Greenwich). The
dstflag field is a flag that, if non-zero, indicates that
Daylight Saving time applies locally during the appropriate
part of the year.</p>

<p>POSIX.1-2001 says that the contents of the timezone and
dstflag fields are unspecified; avoid relying on them.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE This function always returns 0.
(POSIX.1-2001 specifies, and some sys- tems document, a -1
error return.)</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO 4.2BSD, POSIX.1-2001. POSIX.1-2008 removes
the specification of ftime().</p>

<p>This function is obsolete. Dont use it. If the time in
seconds suf- fices, time(2) can be used; gettimeofday(2)
gives microseconds; clock_gettime(2) gives nanoseconds but
is not as widely available.</p>

<p>BUGS Under libc4 and libc5 the millitm field is
meaningful. But early glibc2 is buggy and returns 0 there;
glibc 2.1.1 is correct again.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO gettimeofday(2), time(2)</p>

man-pages project. A description of the project, and
