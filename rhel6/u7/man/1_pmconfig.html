<p>NAME pmconfig - Performance Co-Pilot configuration
parameters</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS $PCP_BINADM_DIR/pmconfig [-a|-l] [-L] [-s]
[name ...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pmconfig displays the values for some or all
configuration parameters of the local Performance Co-Pilot
toolkit installation.</p>

<p>The -L option may be used to change the default
reporting mode so that the capabilities of the PCP library
are reported, rather than the PCP environment.</p>

<p>An output format suitable for sourcing in shell scripts
can be obtained using the -s option, which ensures
configuration information is quoted and preceded by an
export statement. When not reporting the library
capabilities, this mode will produce a statement that does
not override an existing setting in the environment for PCP
configuration variables.</p>

<p>In the default operating mode, pmconfig is often used in
conjunction with the $PCP_DIR environment variable to setup
scripts running under the Windows operating system, where
the filesystem hierarchy differs greatly to the of
Linux/UNIX-based operating systems.</p>

<p>PCP ENVIRONMENT Environment variables with the prefix
PCP_ are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP. On each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in pcp.conf(5).</p>

<p>SEE ALSO pmGetConfig(3), pcp.conf(5) and pcp.env(5).</p>
