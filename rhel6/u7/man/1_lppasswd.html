<p>NAME lppasswd - add, change, or delete digest
passwords.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS lppasswd [ username ] lppasswd -a [ -g
groupname ] username lppasswd -x username</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION lppasswd adds, changes, or deletes passwords
in the CUPS digest pass- word file, passwd.md5. When run by
a normal user, lppasswd will prompt for the old and new
passwords. When run by the super-user, lppasswd can add new
accounts (-a username), change existing accounts (user-
name), or delete accounts (-x username) in the digest
password file. Digest usernames do not have to match local
UNIX usernames.</p>

<p>OPTIONS lppasswd supports the following options:</p>

<p>-g groupname Specifies a group other than the default
system group.</p>

<p>SECURITY ISSUES By default, the lppasswd program is not
installed to allow ordinary users to change their passwords.
To enable this, the lppasswd command must be made setuid to
root with the command: chmod u+s lppasswd</p>

<p>While every attempt has been made to make lppasswd
secure against exploits that could grant super-user
privileges to unprivileged users, paranoid system
administrators may wish to use Basic authentication with
accounts managed by PAM instead.</p>
