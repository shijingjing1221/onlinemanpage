<p>NAME fwide - set and determine the orientation of a FILE
stream</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;wchar.h&gt;</p>

<p>int fwide(FILE *stream, int mode);</p>

<p>Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
feature_test_macros(7)):</p>

<p>fwide(): _XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;= 500 || _ISOC99_SOURCE; or
cc -std=c99</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION When mode is zero, the fwide() function
determines the current orienta- tion of stream. It returns a
positive value if stream is wide-charac- ter oriented, that
is, if wide-character I/O is permitted but char I/O is
disallowed. It returns a negative value if stream is byte
oriented, i.e., if char I/O is permitted but wide-character
I/O is disallowed. It returns zero if stream has no
orientation yet; in this case the next I/O operation might
change the orientation (to byte oriented if it is a char I/O
operation, or to wide-character oriented if it is a
wide-char- acter I/O operation).</p>

<p>Once a stream has an orientation, it cannot be changed
and persists until the stream is closed.</p>

<p>When mode is non-zero, the fwide() function first
attempts to set stream s orientation (to wide-character
oriented if mode is greater than 0, or to byte oriented if
mode is less than 0). It then returns a value denoting the
current orientation, as above.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The fwide() function returns the streams
orientation, after possibly changing it. A positive return
value means wide-character oriented. A negative return value
means byte oriented. A return value of zero means
undecided.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO C99, POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>NOTES Wide-character output to a byte oriented stream
can be performed through the fprintf(3) function with the
%lc and %ls directives.</p>

<p>Char oriented output to a wide-character oriented stream
can be per- formed through the fwprintf(3) function with the
%c and %s directives.</p>
