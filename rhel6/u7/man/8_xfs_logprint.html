<p>NAME xfs_logprint - print the log of an XFS
filesystem</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS xfs_logprint [ options ] device</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION xfs_logprint prints the log of an XFS
filesystem (see xfs(5)). The device argument is the pathname
of the partition or logical volume con- taining the
filesystem. The device can be a regular file if the -f
option is used. The contents of the filesystem remain
undisturbed. There are two major modes of operation in
xfs_logprint.</p>

<p>One mode is better for filesystem operation debugging.
It is called the transactional view and is enabled through
the -t option. The trans- actional view prints only the
portion of the log that pertains to recovery. In other
words, it prints out complete transactions between the tail
and the head. This view tries to display each transaction
without regard to how they are split across log records.</p>

<p>The second mode starts printing out information from the
beginning of the log. Some error blocks might print out in
the beginning because the last log record usually overlaps
the oldest log record. A message is printed when the
physical end of the log is reached and when the logical end
of the log is reached. A log record view is displayed one
record at a time. Transactions that span log records may not
be decoded fully.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -b Extract and print buffer information. Only
used in transactional view.</p>

<p>-c Attempt to continue when an error is detected.</p>

<p>-C filename Copy the log from the filesystem to the file
filename. The log itself is not printed.</p>

<p>-d Dump the log from front to end, printing where each
log record is located on disk.</p>

<p>-D Do not decode anything; just print data.</p>

<p>-e Exit when an error is found in the log. Normally,
xfs_logprint tries to continue and unwind from bad logs.
However, sometimes it just dies in bad ways. Using this
option prevents core dumps.</p>

<p>-f Specifies that the filesystem image to be processed
is stored in a regular file at device (see the mkfs.xfs(8)
-d file option). This might happen if an image copy of a
filesystem has been made into an ordinary file with
xfs_copy(8).</p>

<p>-l logdev External log device. Only for those
filesystems which use an external log.</p>

<p>-i Extract and print inode information. Only used in
transactional view.</p>

<p>-q Extract and print quota information. Only used in
transactional view.</p>

<p>-n Do not try and interpret log data; just interpret log
header information.</p>

<p>-o Also print buffer data in hex. Normally, buffer data
is just decoded, so better information can be printed.</p>

<p>-s start-block Override any notion of where to start
printing.</p>

<p>-t Print out the transactional view.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO mkfs.xfs(8), mount(8).</p>
