<p>LLROUND(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual LLROUND(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME llround, llroundf, llroundl - round to nearest
integer value</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;math.h&gt;</p>

<p>long long llround(double x); long long llroundf(float
x); long long llroundl(long double x);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION These functions shall round their argument
to the nearest integer value, rounding halfway cases away
from zero, regardless of the current rounding direction.</p>

<p>An application wishing to check for error situations
should set errno to zero and call
feclearexcept(FE_ALL_EXCEPT) before calling these functions.
On return, if errno is non-zero or fetestexcept(FE_INVALID |
FE_DIVBYZERO | FE_OVERFLOW | FE_UNDERFLOW) is non-zero, an
error has occurred.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, these functions
shall return the rounded integer value.</p>

<p>If x is NaN, a domain error shall occur, and an
unspecified value is returned.</p>

<p>If x is +Inf, a domain error shall occur and an
unspecified value is returned.</p>

<p>If x is -Inf, a domain error shall occur and an
unspecified value is returned.</p>

<p>If the correct value is positive and too large to
represent as a long long, a domain error shall occur and an
unspecified value is returned.</p>

<p>If the correct value is negative and too large to
represent as a long long, a domain error shall occur and an
unspecified value is returned.</p>

<p>ERRORS These functions shall fail if:</p>

<p>Domain Error The x argument is NaN or &plusmn;Inf, or
the correct value is not rep- resentable as an integer.</p>

<p>If the integer expression (math_errhandling &amp;
MATH_ERRNO) is non-zero, then errno shall be set to [EDOM].
If the integer expression (math_errhandling &amp;
MATH_ERREXCEPT) is non-zero, then the invalid floating-point
exception shall be raised.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE On error, the expressions
(math_errhandling &amp; MATH_ERRNO) and (math_errhandling
&amp; MATH_ERREXCEPT) are independent of each other, but at
least one of them must be non-zero.</p>

<p>RATIONALE These functions differ from the llrint()
functions in that the default rounding direction for the
llround() functions round halfway cases away from zero and
need not raise the inexact floating-point exception for
non-integer arguments that round to within the range of the
return type.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
