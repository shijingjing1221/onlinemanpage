<p>PTHREAD_CANCEL(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
PTHREAD_CANCEL(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME pthread_cancel - cancel execution of a thread</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;</p>

<p>int pthread_cancel(pthread_t thread);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pthread_cancel() function shall request
that thread be canceled. The target thread s cancelability
state and type determines when the cancellation takes
effect. When the cancellation is acted on, the can-
cellation cleanup handlers for thread shall be called. When
the last cancellation cleanup handler returns, the
thread-specific data destruc- tor functions shall be called
for thread. When the last destructor function returns,
thread shall be terminated.</p>

<p>The cancellation processing in the target thread shall
run asyn- chronously with respect to the calling thread
returning from pthread_cancel().</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE If successful, the pthread_cancel()
function shall return zero; other- wise, an error number
shall be returned to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The pthread_cancel() function may fail if:</p>

<p>ESRCH No thread could be found corresponding to that
specified by the given thread ID.</p>

<p>The pthread_cancel() function shall not return an error
code of [EINTR].</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE Two alternative functions were considered for
sending the cancellation notification to a thread. One would
be to define a new SIGCANCEL signal that had the
cancellation semantics when delivered; the other was to
define the new pthread_cancel() function, which would
trigger the can- cellation semantics.</p>

<p>The advantage of a new signal was that so much of the
delivery criteria were identical to that used when trying to
deliver a signal that making cancellation notification a
signal was seen as consistent. Indeed, many implementations
implement cancellation using a special signal. On the other
hand, there would be no signal functions that could be used
with this signal except pthread_kill(), and the behavior of
the delivered cancellation signal would be unlike any
previously existing defined signal.</p>

<p>The benefits of a special function include the
recognition that this signal would be defined because of the
similar delivery criteria and that this is the only common
behavior between a cancellation request and a signal. In
addition, the cancellation delivery mechanism does not have
to be implemented as a signal. There are also strong, if not
stronger, parallels with language exception mechanisms than
with sig- nals that are potentially obscured if the delivery
mechanism is visibly closer to signals.</p>

<p>In the end, it was considered that as there were so many
exceptions to the use of the new signal with existing
signals functions it would be misleading. A special function
has resolved this problem. This func- tion was carefully
defined so that an implementation wishing to provide the
cancellation functions on top of signals could do so. The
special function also means that implementations are not
obliged to implement cancellation with signals.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
