<p>NAME certwatch - generate SSL certificate expiry
warnings</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS certwatch [OPTION...] filename</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The certwatch program is used to issue
warning mail when an SSL certificate is about to expire.</p>

<p>The program has two modes of operation: normal mode and
quiet mode. In normal mode, the certificate given by the
filename argument is examined, and a warning email is issued
to standard output if the certificate is outside its
validity period, or approaching expiry. If the certificate
cannot be found, or any errors occur whilst parsing the
certificate, the certificate is ignored and no output is
produced. In quiet mode, no output is given, but the exit
status can still be used.</p>

<p>The certificate can be specified by its nickname or by a
path to the containing file.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --quiet, -q Enable quiet mode; no output is
produced whether the certificate is expired or not</p>

<p>--period days, -p days Specify the number of days within
which an expiry warning will be produced; default is 30.
Expiry warnings are always produced if, on the day of
invocation, the certificate is not yet valid, has already
expired, or is due to expire either that day or the
following day.</p>

<p>--address address, -a address Specify the address used
in the To field of the warning e-mail issued if quiet mode
is not enabled. The default is root.</p>

<p>--directory cert-directory, -d cert-directory Specify
the database directory containing the certificate and key
database files. The default is yet to be determined.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS The exit code indicates the state of the
certificate:</p>

<p>0 The certificate is outside its validity period, or
approaching expiry</p>

<p>1 The certificate is inside its validity period, or
could not be parsed</p>

<p>NOTES The certwatch program is run daily by crond from
the file /etc/cron.daily/certwatch to generate warning mail
concerning the imminent expiry of SSL certificates
configured for use in the Apache HTTP server. These warnings
can be disabled by adding the line: NOCERTWATCH=yes to the
file /etc/sysconfig/httpd. Additional options to pass to
certwatch can be specified in that file in the
CERTWATCH_OPTS environment variable.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/cron.daily/certwatch,
/etc/sysconfig/httpd</p>
