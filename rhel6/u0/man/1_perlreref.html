<p>NAME perlreref - Perl Regular Expressions Reference</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This is a quick reference to Perl s regular
expressions. For full information see perlre and perlop, as
well as the &quot;SEE ALSO&quot; section in this
document.</p>

<p>OPERATORS &quot;=~&quot; determines to which variable
the regex is applied. In its absence, $_ is used.</p>

<p>$var =~ /foo/;</p>

<p>&quot;!~&quot; determines to which variable the regex is
applied, and negates the result of the match; it returns
false if the match succeeds, and true if it fails.</p>

<p>$var !~ /foo/;</p>

<p>&quot;m/pattern/msixpogc&quot; searches a string for a
pattern match, applying the given options.</p>

<p>m Multiline mode - ^ and $ match internal lines s match
as a Single line - . matches i case-Insensitive x eXtended
legibility - free whitespace and comments p Preserve a copy
of the matched string - ${^PREMATCH}, ${^MATCH},
${^POSTMATCH} will be defined. o compile pattern Once g
Global - all occurrences c don&rsquo;t reset pos on failed
matches when using /g</p>

<p>If pattern is an empty string, the last successfully
matched regex is used. Delimiters other than / may be used
for both this operator and the following ones. The leading
&quot;m&quot; can be omitted if the delimiter is /.</p>

<p>&quot;qr/pattern/msixpo&quot; lets you store a regex in
a variable, or pass one around. Modifiers as for
&quot;m//&quot;, and are stored within the regex.</p>

<p>&quot;s/pattern/replacement/msixpogce&quot; substitutes
matches of pattern with replacement. Modifiers as for
&quot;m//&quot;, with one addition:</p>

<p>e Evaluate &rsquo;replacement&rsquo; as an
expression</p>

<p>e may be specified multiple times. replacement is
interpreted as a double quoted string unless a single-quote
(&quot;&rsquo;&quot;) is the delimiter.</p>

<p>&quot;?pattern?&quot; is like &quot;m/pattern/&quot; but
matches only once. No alternate delimiters can be used. Must
be reset with reset().</p>

<p>SYNTAX Escapes the character immediately following it .
Matches any single character except a newline (unless /s is
used) ^ Matches at the beginning of the string (or line, if
/m is used) $ Matches at the end of the string (or line, if
/m is used) * Matches the preceding element 0 or more times
+ Matches the preceding element 1 or more times ? Matches
the preceding element 0 or 1 times {...} Specifies a range
of occurrences for the element preceding it [...] Matches
any one of the characters contained within the brackets
(...) Groups subexpressions for capturing to $1, $2...
(?:...) Groups subexpressions without capturing (cluster) |
Matches either the subexpression preceding or following it
1, 2, 3 ... Matches the text from the Nth group or 1}, ...
Matches the text from the Nth group 1 or -1}, 2 ... Matches
the text from the Nth previous group name} Named
backreference name&gt; Named backreference name&rsquo; Named
backreference (?P=name) Named backreference (python
syntax)</p>

<p>ESCAPE SEQUENCES These work as in normal strings.</p>

<p>Alarm (beep) \ Escape Formfeed NewlineCarriage return
Tab 37 Any octal ASCII value f Any hexadecimal ASCII value }
A wide hexadecimal value ame} A named character</p>

<p>Lowercase next character Titlecase next character
Lowercase until U Uppercase until Q Disable pattern
metacharacters until End modification</p>

<p>For Titlecase, see &quot;Titlecase&quot;.</p>

<p>This one works differently from normal strings:</p>

<p>An assertion, not backspace, except in a character
class</p>

<p>CHARACTER CLASSES [amy] Match &rsquo;a&rsquo;,
&rsquo;m&rsquo; or &rsquo;y&rsquo; [f-j] Dash specifies
&quot;range&quot; [f-j-] Dash escaped or at start or end
means &rsquo;dash&rsquo; [^f-j] Caret indicates &quot;match
any character _except_ these&quot;</p>

<p>The following sequences work within or without a
character class. The first six are locale aware, all are
Unicode aware. See perllocale and perlunicode for
details.</p>

<p>A digit A nondigit 0 A word character W A non-word
character A whitespace character A non-whitespace character
An horizontal white space A non horizontal white space A
vertical white space A non vertical white space A generic
newline (?&gt;A)</p>

<p>Match a byte (with Unicode, &rsquo;.&rsquo; matches a
character) P Match P-named (Unicode) property {...} Match
Unicode property with long name PP Match non-P P{...} Match
lack of Unicode property with long name Match extended
Unicode combining character sequence</p>

<p>POSIX character classes and their Unicode and Perl
equivalents:</p>

<p>alnum IsAlnum Alphanumeric alpha IsAlpha Alphabetic
ascii IsASCII Any ASCII char blank IsSpace [ ] Horizontal
whitespace (GNU extension) cntrl IsCntrl Control characters
digit IsDigit Digits graph IsGraph Alphanumeric and
punctuation lower IsLower Lowercase chars (locale and
Unicode aware) print IsPrint Alphanumeric, punct, and space
punct IsPunct Punctuation space IsSpace [] Whitespace
IsSpacePerl Perl&rsquo;s whitespace definition upper IsUpper
Uppercase chars (locale and Unicode aware) word IsWord 0
Alphanumeric plus _ (Perl extension) xdigit IsXDigit
[0-9A-Fa-f] Hexadecimal digit</p>

<p>Within a character class:</p>

<p>POSIX traditional Unicode [:digit:] {IsDigit} [:^digit:]
P{IsDigit}</p>

<p>ANCHORS All are zero-width assertions.</p>

<p>^ Match string start (or line, if /m is used) $ Match
string end (or line, if /m is used) or before newline M a
tword boundary (between 72W) c h 0Match except at word
boundary (between 7248W and W) 1string start (regardless of
/m) Matcstring end (before optional newline) Match absolute
string end G Match where previous m//g left off</p>

<p>K Keep the stuff left of the K, don&rsquo;t include it
in $&amp;</p>

<p>QUANTIFIERS Quantifiers are greedy by default -- match
the longest leftmost.</p>

<p>Maximal Minimal Possessive Allowed range ------- -------
---------- ------------- {n,m} {n,m}? {n,m}+ Must occur at
least n times but no more than m times {n,} {n,}? {n,}+ Must
occur at least n times {n} {n}? {n}+ Must occur exactly n
times * *? *+ 0 or more times (same as {0,}) + +? ++ 1 or
more times (same as {1,}) ? ?? ?+ 0 or 1 time (same as
{0,1})</p>

<p>The possessive forms (new in Perl 5.10) prevent
backtracking: what gets matched by a pattern with a
possessive quantifier will not be backtracked into, even if
that causes the whole match to fail.</p>

<p>There is no quantifier {,n} -- that gets understood as a
literal string.</p>

<p>EXTENDED CONSTRUCTS (?#text) A comment (?:...) Groups
subexpressions without capturing (cluster) (?pimsx-imsx:...)
Enable/disable option (as per m// modifiers) (?=...)
Zero-width positive lookahead assertion (?!...) Zero-width
negative lookahead assertion (?&lt;=...) Zero-width positive
lookbehind assertion (?&lt;!...) Zero-width negative
lookbehind assertion (?&gt;...) Grab what we can, prohibit
backtracking (?|...) Branch reset (?&lt;name&gt;...) Named
capture (?&rsquo;name&rsquo;...) Named capture
(?P&lt;name&gt;...) Named capture (python syntax) (?{ code
}) Embedded code, return value becomes $^R (??{ code })
Dynamic regex, return value used as regex (?N) Recurse into
subpattern number N (?-N), (?+N) Recurse into Nth
previous/next subpattern (?R), (?0) Recurse at the beginning
of the whole pattern (?&amp;name) Recurse into a named
subpattern (?P&gt;name) Recurse into a named subpattern
(python syntax) (?(cond)yes|no) (?(cond)yes) Conditional
expression, where &quot;cond&quot; can be: (N) subpattern N
has matched something (&lt;name&gt;) named subpattern has
matched something (&rsquo;name&rsquo;) named subpattern has
matched something (?{code}) code condition (R) true if
recursing (RN) true if recursing into Nth subpattern
(R&amp;name) true if recursing into named subpattern
(DEFINE) always false, no no-pattern allowed</p>

<p>VARIABLES $_ Default variable for operators to use</p>

<p>$&lsquo; Everything prior to matched string $&amp;
Entire matched string $&rsquo; Everything after to matched
string</p>

<p>${^PREMATCH} Everything prior to matched string
${^MATCH} Entire matched string ${^POSTMATCH} Everything
after to matched string</p>

<p>The use of &quot;$&lsquo;&quot;, $&amp; or
&quot;$&rsquo;&quot; will slow down all regex use within
your program. Consult perlvar for &quot;@-&quot; to see
equivalent expressions that won t cause slow down. See also
Devel::SawAmpersand. Starting with Perl 5.10, you can also
use the equivalent variables &quot;${^PREMATCH}&quot;,
&quot;${^MATCH}&quot; and &quot;${^POSTMATCH}&quot;, but for
them to be defined, you have to specify the &quot;/p&quot;
(preserve) modifier on your regular expression.</p>

<p>$1, $2 ... hold the Xth captured expr $+ Last
parenthesized pattern match $^N Holds the most recently
closed capture $^R Holds the result of the last (?{...})
expr @- Offsets of starts of groups. $-[0] holds start of
whole match @+ Offsets of ends of groups. $+[0] holds end of
whole match %+ Named capture buffers %- Named capture
buffers, as array refs</p>

<p>Captured groups are numbered according to their opening
paren.</p>

<p>FUNCTIONS lc Lowercase a string lcfirst Lowercase first
char of a string uc Uppercase a string ucfirst Titlecase
first char of a string</p>

<p>pos Return or set current match position quotemeta Quote
metacharacters reset Reset ?pattern? status study Analyze
string for optimizing matching</p>

<p>split Use a regex to split a string into parts</p>

<p>The first four of these are like the escape sequences
&quot; &quot; &quot;U&quot;, and &quot;&quot;. For
Titlecase, see &quot;Titlecase&quot;.</p>

<p>TERMINOLOGY Titlecase</p>

<p>Unicode concept which most often is equal to uppercase,
but for certain characters like the German &quot;sharp
s&quot; there is a difference.</p>
