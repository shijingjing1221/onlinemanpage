<p>ADJTIME(3) Linux Programmer s Manual ADJTIME(3)</p>

<p>NAME adjtime - correct the time to synchronize the
system clock</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS int adjtime(const struct timeval *delta, struct
timeval *olddelta);</p>

<p>Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
feature_test_macros(7)):</p>

<p>adjtime(): _BSD_SOURCE</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The adjtime() function gradually adjusts the
system clock (as returned by gettimeofday(2)). The amount of
time by which the clock is to be adjusted is specified in
the structure pointed to by delta. This structure has the
following form:</p>

<p>struct timeval { time_t tv_sec; /* seconds */
suseconds_t tv_usec; /* microseconds */ };</p>

<p>If the adjustment in delta is positive, then the system
clock is speeded up by some small percentage (i.e., by
adding a small amount of time to the clock value in each
second) until the adjustment has been completed. If the
adjustment in delta is negative, then the clock is slowed
down in a similar fashion.</p>

<p>If a clock adjustment from an earlier adjtime() call is
already in progress at the time of a later adjtime() call,
and delta is not NULL for the later call, then the earlier
adjustment is stopped, but any already completed part of
that adjustment is not undone.</p>

<p>If olddelta is not NULL, then the buffer that it points
to is used to return the amount of time remaining from any
previous adjustment that has not yet been completed.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, adjtime() returns 0. On
failure, -1 is returned, and errno is set to indicate the
error.</p>

<p>ERRORS EINVAL The adjustment in delta is outside the
permitted range.</p>

<p>EPERM The caller does not have sufficient privilege to
adjust the time. Under Linux the CAP_SYS_TIME capability is
required.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO 4.3BSD, System V.</p>

<p>NOTES The adjustment that adjtime() makes to the clock
is carried out in such a manner that the clock is always
monotonically increasing. Using adj- time() to adjust the
time prevents the problems that can be caused for certain
applications (e.g., make(1)) by abrupt positive or negative
jumps in the system time.</p>

<p>adjtime() is intended to be used to make small
adjustments to the sys- tem time. Most systems impose a
limit on the adjustment that can be specified in delta. In
the glibc implementation, delta must be less than or equal
to (INT_MAX / 1000000 - 2) and greater than or equal to
(INT_MIN / 1000000 + 2) (respectively 2145 and -2145 seconds
on i386).</p>

<p>BUGS A longstanding bug meant that if delta was
specified as NULL, no valid information about the
outstanding clock adjustment was returned in old- delta. (In
this circumstance, adjtime() should return the outstanding
clock adjustment, without changing it.) This bug is fixed on
systems with glibc 2.8 or later and Linux kernel 2.6.26 or
later.</p>
