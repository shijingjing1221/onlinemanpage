<p>TRACEHOOK_REPORT_SYS(9) Kernel Internals
TRACEHOOK_REPORT_SYS(9)</p>

<p>NAME tracehook_report_syscall_entry - task is about to
attempt a system call</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS __must_check int
tracehook_report_syscall_entry(struct pt_regs * regs);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS regs user register state of current task</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This will be called if TIF_SYSCALL_TRACE has
been set, when the current task has just entered the kernel
for a system call. Full user register state is available
here. Changing the values in regs can affect the system call
number and arguments to be tried. It is safe to block here,
preventing the system call from beginning.</p>

<p>Returns zero normally, or nonzero if the calling arch
code should abort the system call. That must prevent normal
entry so no system call is made. If task ever returns to
user mode after this, its register state is unspecified, but
should be something harmless like an ENOSYS error return. It
should preserve enough information so that syscall_rollback
can work (see asm-generic/syscall.h).</p>

<p>Called without locks, just after entering kernel
mode.</p>
