<p>SYSTEM(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual SYSTEM(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME system - issue a command</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</p>

<p>int system(const char *command);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION If command is a null pointer, the system()
function shall determine whether the host environment has a
command processor. If command is not a null pointer, the
system() function shall pass the string pointed to by
command to that command processor to be executed in an
implementa- tion-defined manner; this might then cause the
program calling system() to behave in a non-conforming
manner or to terminate.</p>

<p>The environment of the executed command shall be as if a
child process were created using fork(), and the child
process invoked the sh utility using execl() as follows:</p>

<p>execl(&lt;shell path&gt;, &quot;sh&quot;,
&quot;-c&quot;, command, (char *)0);</p>

<p>where &lt;shell path&gt; is an unspecified pathname for
the sh utility.</p>

<p>The system() function shall ignore the SIGINT and
SIGQUIT signals, and shall block the SIGCHLD signal, while
waiting for the command to termi- nate. If this might cause
the application to miss a signal that would have killed it,
then the application should examine the return value from
system() and take whatever action is appropriate to the
applica- tion if the command terminated due to receipt of a
signal.</p>

<p>The system() function shall not affect the termination
status of any child of the calling processes other than the
process or processes it itself creates.</p>

<p>The system() function shall not return until the child
process has ter- minated.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE If command is a null pointer, system()
shall return non-zero to indi- cate that a command processor
is available, or zero if none is avail- able. The system()
function shall always return non-zero when command is
NULL.</p>

<p>If command is not a null pointer, system() shall return
the termination status of the command language interpreter
in the format specified by waitpid(). The termination status
shall be as defined for the sh util- ity; otherwise, the
termination status is unspecified. If some error prevents
the command language interpreter from executing after the
child process is created, the return value from system()
shall be as if the command language interpreter had
terminated using exit(127) or _exit(127). If a child process
cannot be created, or if the termination status for the
command language interpreter cannot be obtained, sys- tem()
shall return -1 and set errno to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The system() function may set errno values as
described by fork().</p>

<p>In addition, system() may fail if:</p>

<p>ECHILD The status of the child process created by
system() is no longer available.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE If the return value of system() is not
-1, its value can be decoded through the use of the macros
described in &lt;sys/wait.h&gt;. For conve- nience, these
macros are also provided in &lt;stdlib.h&gt;.</p>

<p>Note that, while system() must ignore SIGINT and SIGQUIT
and block SIGCHLD while waiting for the child to terminate,
the handling of sig- nals in the executed command is as
specified by fork() and exec. For example, if SIGINT is
being caught or is set to SIG_DFL when system() is called,
then the child is started with SIGINT handling set to
SIG_DFL.</p>

<p>Ignoring SIGINT and SIGQUIT in the parent process
prevents coordination problems (two processes reading from
the same terminal, for example) when the executed command
ignores or catches one of the signals. It is also usually
the correct action when the user has given a command to the
application to be executed synchronously (as in the! command
in many interactive applications). In either case, the
signal should be delivered only to the child process, not to
the application itself. There is one situation where
ignoring the signals might have less than the desired
effect. This is when the application uses system() to per-
form some task invisible to the user. If the user typed the
interrupt character ( &quot;^C&quot;, for example) while
system() is being used in this way, one would expect the
application to be killed, but only the exe- cuted command is
killed. Applications that use system() in this way should
carefully check the return status from system() to see if
the executed command was successful, and should take
appropriate action when the command fails.</p>

<p>Blocking SIGCHLD while waiting for the child to
terminate prevents the application from catching the signal
and obtaining status from sys- tem()s child process before
system() can get the status itself.</p>

<p>The context in which the utility is ultimately executed
may differ from that in which system() was called. For
example, file descriptors that have the FD_CLOEXEC flag set
are closed, and the process ID and parent process ID are
different. Also, if the executed utility changes its
environment variables or its current working directory, that
change is not reflected in the callers context.</p>

<p>There is no defined way for an application to find the
specific path for the shell. However, confstr() can provide
a value for PATH that is guaranteed to find the sh
utility.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The system() function should not be used by
programs that have set user (or group) ID privileges. The
fork() and exec family of functions (except execlp() and
execvp()), should be used instead. This prevents any
unforeseen manipulation of the environment of the user that
could cause execution of commands not anticipated by the
calling program.</p>

<p>There are three levels of specification for the system()
function. The ISO C standard gives the most basic. It
requires that the function exists, and defines a way for an
application to query whether a command language interpreter
exists. It says nothing about the command language or the
environment in which the command is interpreted.</p>

<p>IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 places additional restrictions on
system(). It requires that if there is a command language
interpreter, the environ- ment must be as specified by
fork() and exec. This ensures, for exam- ple, that close-on-
exec works, that file locks are not inherited, and that the
process ID is different. It also specifies the return value
from system() when the command line can be run, thus giving
the appli- cation some information about the commands
completion status.</p>

<p>Finally, IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 requires the command to be
interpreted as in the shell command language defined in the
Shell and Utilities volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001.</p>

<p>Note that, system(NULL) is required to return non-zero,
indicating that there is a command language interpreter. At
first glance, this would seem to conflict with the ISO C
standard which allows system(NULL) to return zero. There is
no conflict, however. A system must have a com- mand
language interpreter, and is non-conforming if none is
present. It is therefore permissible for the system()
function on such a system to implement the behavior
specified by the ISO C standard as long as it is understood
that the implementation does not conform to IEEE Std
1003.1-2001 if system(NULL) returns zero.</p>

<p>It was explicitly decided that when command is NULL,
system() should not be required to check to make sure that
the command language inter- preter actually exists with the
correct mode, that there are enough processes to execute it,
and so on. The call system(NULL) could, theo- retically,
check for such problems as too many existing child pro-
cesses, and return zero. However, it would be inappropriate
to return zero due to such a (presumably) transient
condition. If some condition exists that is not under the
control of this application and that would cause any
system() call to fail, that system has been rendered
non-con- forming.</p>

<p>Early drafts required, or allowed, system() to return
with errno set to [EINTR] if it was interrupted with a
signal. This error return was removed, and a requirement
that system() not return until the child has terminated was
added. This means that if a waitpid() call in system() exits
with errno set to [EINTR], system() must reissue the
waitpid(). This change was made for two reasons:</p>

<p>1. There is no way for an application to clean up if
system() returns [EINTR], short of calling wait(), and that
could have the undesir- able effect of returning the status
of children other than the one started by system().</p>

<p>2. While it might require a change in some historical
implementations, those implementations already have to be
changed because they use wait() instead of waitpid().</p>

<p>Note that if the application is catching SIGCHLD
signals, it will receive such a signal before a successful
system() call returns.</p>

<p>To conform to IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, system() must use
waitpid(), or some similar function, instead of wait().</p>

<p>The following code sample illustrates how system() might
be implemented on an implementation conforming to IEEE Std
1003.1-2001.</p>

<p>#include &lt;signal.h&gt; int system(const char *cmd) {
int stat; pid_t pid; struct sigaction sa, savintr, savequit;
sigset_t saveblock; if (cmd == NULL) return(1);
sa.sa_handler = SIG_IGN; sigemptyset(&amp;sa.sa_mask);
sa.sa_flags = 0; sigemptyset(&amp;savintr.sa_mask);
sigemptyset(&amp;savequit.sa_mask); sigaction(SIGINT,
&amp;sa, &amp;savintr); sigaction(SIGQUIT, &amp;sa,
&amp;savequit); sigaddset(&amp;sa.sa_mask, SIGCHLD);
sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK, &amp;sa.sa_mask, &amp;saveblock); if
((pid = fork()) == 0) { sigaction(SIGINT, &amp;savintr,
(struct sigaction *)0); sigaction(SIGQUIT, &amp;savequit,
(struct sigaction *)0); sigprocmask(SIG_SETMASK,
&amp;saveblock, (sigset_t *)0); execl(&quot;/bin/sh&quot;,
&quot;sh&quot;, &quot;-c&quot;, cmd, (char *)0); _exit(127);
} if (pid == -1) { stat = -1; /* errno comes from fork() */
} else { while (waitpid(pid, &amp;stat, 0) == -1) { if
(errno != EINTR){ stat = -1; break; } } } sigaction(SIGINT,
&amp;savintr, (struct sigaction *)0); sigaction(SIGQUIT,
&amp;savequit, (struct sigaction *)0);
sigprocmask(SIG_SETMASK, &amp;saveblock, (sigset_t *)0);
return(stat); }</p>

<p>Note that, while a particular implementation of system()
(such as the one above) can assume a particular path for the
shell, such a path is not necessarily valid on another
system. The above example is not portable, and is not
intended to be.</p>

<p>One reviewer suggested that an implementation of
system() might want to use an environment variable such as
SHELL to determine which command interpreter to use. The
supposed implementation would use the default command
interpreter if the one specified by the environment variable
was not available. This would allow a user, when using an
application that prompts for command lines to be processed
using system(), to spec- ify a different command
interpreter. Such an implementation is discour- aged. If the
alternate command interpreter did not follow the command
line syntax specified in the Shell and Utilities volume of
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, then changing SHELL would render
system() non- conforming. This would affect applications
that expected the specified behavior from system(), and
since the Shell and Utilities volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001
does not mention that SHELL affects system(), the
application would not know that it needed to unset
SHELL.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
