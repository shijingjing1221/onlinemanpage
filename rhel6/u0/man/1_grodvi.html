<p>NAME grodvi - convert groff output to TeX dvi format</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS grodvi [ -dv ] [ -wn ] [ -Fdir ] [ files...
]</p>

<p>It is possible to have whitespace between a command line
option and its parameter.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION grodvi is a driver for groff that produces
TeX dvi format. Normally it should be run by groff -Tdvi.
This will run troff -Tdvi; it will also input the macros
/usr/share/groff/1.18.1.4/tmac/dvi.tmac; if the input is
being preprocessed with eqn it will also input
/usr/share/groff/1.18.1.4/font/devdvi/eqnchar.</p>

<p>The dvi file generated by grodvi can be printed by any
correctly-writ- ten dvi driver. The troff drawing primitives
are implemented using the tpic version 2 specials. If the
driver does not support these, the commands will not produce
any output.</p>

<p>There is an additional drawing command available:</p>

<p>R dh dv Draw a rule (solid black rectangle), with one
corner at the cur- rent position, and the diagonally
opposite corner at the current position +(dh,dv). Afterwards
the current position will be at the opposite corner. This
produces a rule in the dvi file and so can be printed even
with a driver that does not support the tpic specials unlike
the other The groff command anything is translated into the
same command in the dvi file as would be produced
bypecial{anything} in TeX; any- thing may not contain a
newline.</p>

<p>For inclusion of EPS image files, grodvi loads
pspic.tmac automati- cally, providing the PSPIC macro.
Please check grops (1) for a detailed description of this
macro.</p>

<p>Font files for grodvi can be created from tfm files
using tfmtodit(1). The font description file should contain
the following additional com- mands:</p>

<p>internalname name The name of the tfm file (without the
.tfm extension) is name.</p>

<p>checksum n The checksum in the tfm file is n.</p>

<p>designsize n The designsize in the tfm file is n.</p>

<p>These are automatically generated by tfmtodit.</p>

<p>The default color form and M is black. Currently, the
drawing color for to gray.</p>

<p>In troff the escape sequence can be used to access
characters by their position in the corresponding tfm file;
all characters in the tfm file can be accessed this way.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -d Do not use tpic specials to implement drawing
commands. Hori- zontal and vertical lines will be
implemented by rules. Other drawing commands will be
ignored.</p>

<p>-v Print the version number.</p>

<p>-wn Set the default line thickness to n thousandths of
an em. If this option isnt specified, the line thickness
defaults to 0.04 em.</p>

<p>-Fdir Prepend directory dir/devname to the search path
for font and device description files; name is the name of
the device, usu- ally dvi.</p>

<p>USAGE There are styles called R, I, B, and BI mounted at
font positions 1 to 4. The fonts are grouped into families T
and H having members in each of these styles:</p>

<p>TR CM Roman (cmr10)</p>

<p>TI CM Text Italic (cmti10)</p>

<p>TB CM Bold Extended Roman (cmbx10)</p>

<p>TBI CM Bold Extended Text Italic (cmbxti10)</p>

<p>HR CM Sans Serif (cmss10)</p>

<p>HI CM Slanted Sans Serif (cmssi10)</p>

<p>HB CM Sans Serif Bold Extended (cmssbx10)</p>

<p>HBI CM Slanted Sans Serif Bold Extended (cmssbxo10)</p>

<p>There are also the following fonts which are not members
of a family:</p>

<p>CW CM Typewriter Text (cmtt10)</p>

<p>CWI CM Italic Typewriter Text (cmitt10)</p>

<p>Special fonts are MI (cmmi10), S (cmsy10), EX (cmex10),
and, perhaps surprisingly, TR, TI, and CW, due to the
different font encodings of text fonts. For italic fonts,
CWI is used instead of CW.</p>

<p>Finally, the symbol fonts of the American Mathematical
Society are available as special fonts SA (msam10) and SB
(msbm10). These two fonts are not mounted by default.</p>

<p>Using the option -mec (loading the file ec.tmac) EC and
TC fonts are used. The design of the EC family is very
similar to that of the CM fonts; additionally, they give a
much better coverage of groff symbols. Note that ec.tmac
must be called before any language-specific files; it doesnt
take care of hcode values.</p>

<p>BUGS Dvi files produced by grodvi use a different
resolution (57816 units per inch) to those produced by TeX.
Incorrectly written drivers which assume the resolution used
by TeX, rather than using the resolution specified in the
dvi file will not work with grodvi.</p>

<p>When using the -d option with boxed tables, vertical and
horizontal lines can sometimes protrude by one pixel. This
is a consequence of the way TeX requires that the heights
and widths of rules be rounded.</p>
