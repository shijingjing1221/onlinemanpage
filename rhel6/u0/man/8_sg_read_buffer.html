<p>SG_READ_BUFFER(8) SG3_UTILS SG_READ_BUFFER(8)</p>

<p>NAME sg_read_buffer - send a SCSI READ BUFFER
command</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sg_read_buffer [--help] [--hex] [--id=ID]
[--length=LEN] [--mode=MO] [--offset=OFF] [--raw]
[--verbose] [--version] DEVICE</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Sends a SCSI READ BUFFER command to the
DEVICE, and if there is a response either decodes it, prints
it in hexadecimal or sends it in binary to stdout. If a
response is received for a &quot;descriptor&quot; mode then,
in the absence of --hex and --raw, it is decoded. Response
for non-descriptor modes are output in hexadecimal unless
the --raw option is given.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Arguments to long options are mandatory for
short options as well.</p>

<p>-h, --help output the usage message then exit. If used
multiple times also prints the mode names and their
acronyms.</p>

<p>-H, --hex output the response in hexadecimal.</p>

<p>-i, --id=ID this option sets the buffer id field in the
cdb. ID is a value between 0 (default) and 255
inclusive.</p>

<p>-l, --length=LEN where LEN is the length, in bytes, that
is placed in the &quot;allo- cation length&quot; field in
the cdb. The default value is 4 (bytes). The device may
respond with less bytes.</p>

<p>-m, --mode=MO this option sets the mode field in the
cdb. MO is a value between 0 (default) and 31 inclusive.
Alternatively an abbrevia- tion can be given. To list the
available mode abbreviations given an invalid one (e.g.
--mode=xxx).</p>

<p>-o, --offset=OFF this option sets the buffer offset
field in the cdb. OFF is a value between 0 (default) and
2**24-1 . It is a byte offset.</p>

<p>-r, --raw if a response is received then it is sent in
binary to stdout.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose increase the level of verbosity, (i.e.
debug output).</p>

<p>-V, --version print the version string and then
exit.</p>

<p>NOTES All numbers given with options are assumed to be
decimal. Alterna- tively numerical values can be given in
hexadecimal preceded by either &quot;0x&quot; or
&quot;0X&quot; (or has a trailing &quot;h&quot; or
&quot;H&quot;).</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The exit status of sg_read_buffer is 0 when
it is successful. Otherwise see the sg3_utils(8) man
page.</p>
