<p>CFLOW(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual CFLOW(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME cflow - generate a C-language flowgraph
(DEVELOPMENT)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS cflow [-r][-d num][-D name[=def]] ... [-i
incl][-I dir] ... [-U dir] ... file ...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The cflow utility shall analyze a collection
of object files or assem- bler, C-language, lex, or yacc
source files, and attempt to build a graph, written to
standard output, charting the external references.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The cflow utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines, except that the order of the -D,
-I, and -U options (which are identical to their
interpretation by c99) is significant.</p>

<p>The following options shall be supported:</p>

<p>-d num Indicate the depth at which the flowgraph is cut
off. The appli- cation shall ensure that the argument num is
a decimal integer. By default this is a very large number
(typically greater than 32000). Attempts to set the cut-off
depth to a non-positive integer shall be ignored.</p>

<p>-i incl Increase the number of included symbols. The
incl option-argu- ment is one of the following
characters:</p>

<p>x Include external and static data symbols. The default
shall be to include only functions in the flowgraph.</p>

<p>_ (Underscore) Include names that begin with an
underscore. The default shall be to exclude these functions
(and data if -i x is used).</p>

<p>-r Reverse the caller:callee relationship, producing an
inverted listing showing the callers of each function. The
listing shall also be sorted in lexicographical order by
callee.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operand is supported:</p>

<p>file The pathname of a file for which a graph is to be
generated. Filenames suffixed by .l shall shall be taken to
be lex input, .y as yacc input, .c as c99 input, and .i as
the output of c99 -E. Such files shall be processed as
appropriate, determined by their suffix.</p>

<p>Files suffixed by .s (conventionally assembler source)
may have more limited information extracted from them.</p>

<p>STDIN Not used.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES The input files shall be object files or
assembler, C-language, lex, or yacc source files.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of cflow:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_COLLATE</p>

<p>Determine the locale for the ordering of the output when
the -r option is used.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments
and input files).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT The flowgraph written to standard output shall be
formatted as follows:</p>

<p>&quot;%d %s:%n&quot;, &lt;reference number&gt;,
&lt;global&gt;, &lt;definition&gt;</p>

<p>Each line of output begins with a reference (that is,
line) number, followed by indentation of at least one column
position per level. This is followed by the name of the
global, a colon, and its definition. Normally globals are
only functions not defined as an external or beginning with
an underscore; see the OPTIONS section for the -i inclu-
sion option. For information extracted from C-language
source, the def- inition consists of an abstract type
declaration (for example, char *) and, delimited by angle
brackets, the name of the source file and the line number
where the definition was found. Definitions extracted from
object files indicate the filename and location counter
under which the symbol appeared (for example, text).</p>

<p>Once a definition of a name has been written, subsequent
references to that name contain only the reference number of
the line where the defi- nition can be found. For undefined
references, only &quot;&lt;&gt;&quot; shall be written.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 Successful completion.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE Files produced by lex and yacc cause
the reordering of line number dec- larations, and this can
confuse cflow. To obtain proper results, the input of yacc
or lex must be directed to cflow.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Given the following in file.c:</p>

<p>int i; int f(); int g(); int h(); int main() { f(); g();
f(); } int f() { i = h(); }</p>

<p>The command:</p>

<p>cflow -i x file.c</p>

<p>produces the output:</p>

<p>1 main: int(), &lt;file.c 6&gt; 2 f: int(), &lt;file.c
13&gt; 3 h: &lt;&gt; 4 i: int, &lt;file.c 1&gt; 5 g:
&lt;&gt;</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
