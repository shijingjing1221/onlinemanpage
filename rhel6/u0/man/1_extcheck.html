<p>NAME extcheck - A utility to detect jar conflicts</p>

<p>extcheck detects version conflicts between a target jar
file and cur- rently installed extension jar files.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS extcheck [ -verbose ] targetfile.jar</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The extcheck utility checks a specified Jar
file for title and version conflicts with any extensions
installed in the Java(TM) SDK. Before installing an
extension, you can use this utility to see if the same or a
more recent version of the extension is already
installed.</p>

<p>The extcheck utility compares the Specification-title
and Specifica- tion-version headers in the manifest of the
targetfile.jar file against the corresponding headers in all
Jar files currently installed in the extension directory.
(The extension directory is jre/lib/ext by default.) The
extcheck utility compares version numbers in the same way as
the method java.lang.Package.isCompatibleWith.</p>

<p>If no conflict is detected, the return code is 0.</p>

<p>If the manifest of any jar file in the extensions
directory has the same Specification-title and the same or a
newer Specification-version number, a non-zero error code is
returned. A non-zero error code is also returned if
targetfile.jar does not have the Specification-title or
Specification-version attributes in its manifest.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -verbose Lists Jar files in the extension
directory as they are checked. Additionally, manifest
attributes of the target jar file and any conflicting jar
files are also reported.</p>

<p>-Joption Pass option to the Java virtual machine, where
option is one of the options described on the reference page
for the java application launcher. For example, -J-Xms48m
sets the startup memory to 48 megabytes.</p>
