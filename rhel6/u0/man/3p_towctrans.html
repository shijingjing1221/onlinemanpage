<p>TOWCTRANS(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
TOWCTRANS(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME towctrans - wide-character transliteration</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;wctype.h&gt;</p>

<p>wint_t towctrans(wint_t wc, wctrans_t desc);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The towctrans() function shall transliterate
the wide-character code wc using the mapping described by
desc. The current setting of the LC_CTYPE category should be
the same as during the call to wctrans() that returned the
value desc. If the value of desc is invalid (that is, not
obtained by a call to wctrans() or desc is invalidated by a
subsequent call to setlocale() that has affected category
LC_CTYPE ), the result is unspecified.</p>

<p>An application wishing to check for error situations
should set errno to 0 before calling towctrans(). If errno
is non-zero on return, an error has occurred.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE If successful, the towctrans() function
shall return the mapped value of wc using the mapping
described by desc. Otherwise, it shall return wc
unchanged.</p>

<p>ERRORS The towctrans() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL desc contains an invalid transliteration
descriptor.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The strings &quot;tolower&quot; and
&quot;toupper&quot; are reserved for the standard map- ping
names. In the table below, the functions in the left column
are equivalent to the functions in the right column.</p>

<p>towlower(wc) towctrans(wc, wctrans(&quot;tolower&quot;))
towupper(wc) towctrans(wc, wctrans(&quot;toupper&quot;))</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
