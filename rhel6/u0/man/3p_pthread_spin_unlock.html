<p>PTHREAD_SPIN_UNLOCK(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
PTHREAD_SPIN_UNLOCK(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME pthread_spin_unlock - unlock a spin lock object
(ADVANCED REALTIME THREADS)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;</p>

<p>int pthread_spin_unlock(pthread_spinlock_t *lock);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pthread_spin_unlock() function shall
release the spin lock refer- enced by lock which was locked
via the pthread_spin_lock() or pthread_spin_trylock()
functions. The results are undefined if the lock is not held
by the calling thread. If there are threads spinning on the
lock when pthread_spin_unlock() is called, the lock becomes
available and an unspecified spinning thread shall acquire
the lock.</p>

<p>The results are undefined if this function is called
with an uninitial- ized thread spin lock.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, the
pthread_spin_unlock() function shall return zero; otherwise,
an error number shall be returned to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The pthread_spin_unlock() function may fail
if:</p>

<p>EINVAL An invalid argument was specified.</p>

<p>EPERM The calling thread does not hold the lock.</p>

<p>This function shall not return an error code of
[EINTR].</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The pthread_spin_unlock() function is
part of the Spin Locks option and need not be provided on
all implementations.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
