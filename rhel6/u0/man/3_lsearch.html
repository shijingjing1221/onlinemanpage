<p>LSEARCH(3) Linux Programmer s Manual LSEARCH(3)</p>

<p>NAME lfind, lsearch - linear search of an array</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;search.h&gt;</p>

<p>void *lfind(const void *key, const void *base, size_t
*nmemb, size_t size, int(*compar)(const void *, const void
*));</p>

<p>void *lsearch(const void *key, void *base, size_t
*nmemb, size_t size, int(*compar)(const void *, const void
*));</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION lfind() and lsearch() perform a linear
search for key in the array base which has *nmemb elements
of size bytes each. The comparison function referenced by
compar is expected to have two arguments which point to the
key object and to an array member, in that order, and which
returns zero if the key object matches the array member, and
non-zero other- wise.</p>

<p>If lsearch() does not find a matching element, then the
key object is inserted at the end of the table, and *nmemb
is incremented. In par- ticular, one should know that a
matching element exists, or that more room is available.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE lfind() returns a pointer to a matching
member of the array, or NULL if no match is found. lsearch()
returns a pointer to a matching member of the array, or to
the newly added member if no match is found.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO SVr4, 4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001. Present in
libc since libc-4.6.27.</p>

<p>BUGS The naming is unfortunate.</p>
