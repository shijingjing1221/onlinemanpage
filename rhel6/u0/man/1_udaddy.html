<p>NAME udaddy - RDMA CM datagram setup and simple
ping-pong test.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS udaddy [-s server_address] [-b bind_address]
[-c connections] [-C message_count] [-S message_size] [-p
port_space] udaddy -s server_address [-b bind_address] [-c
connections] [-C message_count] [-S message_size] [-t tos]
[-p port_space]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Establishes a set of unreliable RDMA
datagram communication paths between two nodes using the
librdmacm, optionally transfers datagrams between the nodes,
then tears down the communication.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -s server_address The network name or IP address
of the server system listening for communication. The used
name or address must route over an RDMA device. This option
must be specified by the client.</p>

<p>-b bind_address The local network address to bind
to.</p>

<p>-c connections The number of communication paths to
establish between the client and server. The test uses
unreliable datagram communica- tion, so no actual
connections are formed. (default 1)</p>

<p>-C message_count The number of messages to transfer over
each connection. (default 10)</p>

<p>-S message_size The size of each message transferred, in
bytes. This value must be smaller than the MTU of the
underlying RDMA transport, or an error will occur. (default
100)</p>

<p>-t tos Indicates the type of service used for the
communication. Type of service is implementation dependent
based on subnet configu- ration.</p>

<p>-p port_space The port space of the datagram
communication. May be either the RDMA UDP (0x0111) or IPoIB
(0x0002) port space. (default RDMA_PS_UDP)</p>

<p>NOTES Basic usage is to start udaddy on a server system,
then run udaddy -s server_name on a client system.</p>

<p>Because this test maps RDMA resources to userspace,
users must ensure that they have available system resources
and permissions. See the libibverbs README file for
additional details.</p>
