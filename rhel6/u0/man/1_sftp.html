<p>SFTP(1) BSD General Commands Manual SFTP(1)</p>

<p>NAME sftp - secure file transfer program</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sftp [-1Cv] [-B buffer_size] [-b batchfile] [-F
ssh_config] [-o ssh_option] [-P sftp_server_path] [-R
num_requests] [-S program] [-s subsystem | sftp_server] host
sftp [user@]host[:file ...] sftp [user@]host[:dir[/]] sftp
-b batchfile [user@]host</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION sftp is an interactive file transfer
program, similar to ftp(1), which performs all operations
over an encrypted ssh(1) transport. It may also use many
features of ssh, such as public key authentication and
compres- sion. sftp connects and logs into the specified
host, then enters an interactive command mode.</p>

<p>The second usage format will retrieve files
automatically if a non-inter- active authentication method
is used; otherwise it will do so after suc- cessful
interactive authentication.</p>

<p>The third usage format allows sftp to start in a remote
directory.</p>

<p>The final usage format allows for automated sessions
using the -b option. In such cases, it is necessary to
configure non-interactive authentica- tion to obviate the
need to enter a password at connection time (see sshd(8) and
ssh-keygen(1) for details). The options are as follows:</p>

<p>-1 Specify the use of protocol version 1.</p>

<p>-B buffer_size Specify the size of the buffer that sftp
uses when transferring files. Larger buffers require fewer
round trips at the cost of higher memory consumption. The
default is 32768 bytes.</p>

<p>-b batchfile Batch mode reads a series of commands from
an input batchfile instead of stdin. Since it lacks user
interaction it should be used in conjunction with
non-interactive authentication. A batchfile of - may be used
to indicate standard input. sftp will abort if any of the
following commands fail: get, put, rename, ln, rm, mkdir,
chdir, ls, lchdir, chmod, chown, chgrp, lpwd, df, and
lmkdir. Termination on error can be suppressed on a command
by command basis by prefixing the command with a - character
(for example, -rm /tmp/blah*).</p>

<p>-C Enables compression (via sshs -C flag).</p>

<p>-F ssh_config Specifies an alternative per-user
configuration file for ssh(1). This option is directly
passed to ssh(1).</p>

<p>-o ssh_option Can be used to pass options to ssh in the
format used in ssh_config(5). This is useful for specifying
options for which there is no separate sftp command-line
flag. For example, to specify an alternate port use: sftp
-oPort=24. For full details of the options listed below, and
their possible values, see ssh_config(5).</p>

<p>-P sftp_server_path Connect directly to a local sftp
server (rather than via ssh(1)). This option may be useful
in debugging the client and server.</p>

<p>-R num_requests Specify how many requests may be
outstanding at any one time. Increasing this may slightly
improve file transfer speed but will increase memory usage.
The default is 64 outstanding requests.</p>

<p>-S program Name of the program to use for the encrypted
connection. The program must understand ssh(1) options.</p>

<p>-s subsystem | sftp_server Specifies the SSH2 subsystem
or the path for an sftp server on the remote host. A path is
useful for using sftp over protocol version 1, or when the
remote sshd(8) does not have an sftp sub- system
configured.</p>

<p>-v Raise logging level. This option is also passed to
ssh.</p>

<p>INTERACTIVE COMMANDS Once in interactive mode, sftp
understands a set of commands similar to those of ftp(1).
Commands are case insensitive. Pathnames that contain spaces
must be enclosed in quotes. Any special characters contained
within pathnames that are recognized by glob(3) must be
escaped with backslashes ().</p>

<p>bye Quit sftp.</p>

<p>cd path Change remote directory to path.</p>

<p>chgrp grp path Change group of file path to grp. path
may contain glob(3) char- acters and may match multiple
files. grp must be a numeric GID.</p>

<p>chmod mode path Change permissions of file path to mode.
path may contain glob(3) characters and may match multiple
files.</p>

<p>chown own path Change owner of file path to own. path
may contain glob(3) char- acters and may match multiple
files. own must be a numeric UID.</p>

<p>df [-hi] [path] Display usage information for the
filesystem holding the current directory (or path if
specified). If the -h flag is specified, the capacity
information will be displayed using
&quot;human-readable&quot; suffixes. The -i flag requests
display of inode information in addition to capacity
information. This command is only supported on servers that
implement the statvfs@openssh.com extension.</p>

<p>exit Quit sftp.</p>

<p>get [-P] remote-path [local-path] Retrieve the
remote-path and store it on the local machine. If the local
path name is not specified, it is given the same name it has
on the remote machine. remote-path may contain glob(3)
characters and may match multiple files. If it does and
local-path is specified, then local-path must specify a
direc- tory. If the -P flag is specified, then full file
permissions and access times are copied too.</p>

<p>help Display help text.</p>

<p>lcd path Change local directory to path.</p>

<p>lls [ls-options [path]] Display local directory listing
of either path or current direc- tory if path is not
specified. ls-options may contain any flags supported by the
local systems ls(1) command. path may contain glob(3)
characters and may match multiple files.</p>

<p>lmkdir path Create local directory specified by
path.</p>

<p>ln oldpath newpath Create a symbolic link from oldpath
to newpath.</p>

<p>lpwd Print local working directory.</p>

<p>ls [-1aflnrSt] [path] Display a remote directory listing
of either path or the current directory if path is not
specified. path may contain glob(3) characters and may match
multiple files.</p>

<p>The following flags are recognized and alter the
behaviour of ls accordingly:</p>

<p>-1 Produce single columnar output.</p>

<p>-a List files beginning with a dot (.).</p>

<p>-f Do not sort the listing. The default sort order is
lexi- cographical.</p>

<p>-l Display additional details including permissions and
own- ership information.</p>

<p>-n Produce a long listing with user and group
information presented numerically.</p>

<p>-r Reverse the sort order of the listing.</p>

<p>-S Sort the listing by file size.</p>

<p>-t Sort the listing by last modification time.</p>

<p>lumask umask Set local umask to umask.</p>

<p>mkdir path Create remote directory specified by
path.</p>

<p>progress Toggle display of progress meter.</p>

<p>put [-P] local-path [remote-path] Upload local-path and
store it on the remote machine. If the remote path name is
not specified, it is given the same name it has on the local
machine. local-path may contain glob(3) charac- ters and may
match multiple files. If it does and remote-path is
specified, then remote-path must specify a directory. If the
-P flag is specified, then the files full permission and
access time are copied too.</p>

<p>pwd Display remote working directory.</p>

<p>quit Quit sftp.</p>

<p>rename oldpath newpath Rename remote file from oldpath
to newpath.</p>

<p>rm path Delete remote file specified by path.</p>

<p>rmdir path Remove remote directory specified by
path.</p>

<p>symlink oldpath newpath Create a symbolic link from
oldpath to newpath.</p>

<p>version Display the sftp protocol version.</p>

<p>!command Execute command in local shell.</p>

<p>! Escape to local shell.</p>

<p>? Synonym for help.</p>
