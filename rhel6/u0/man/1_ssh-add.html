<p>SSH-ADD(1) BSD General Commands Manual SSH-ADD(1)</p>

<p>NAME ssh-add - adds RSA or DSA identities to the
authentication agent</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ssh-add [-cDdLlXx] [-t life] [file ...] ssh-add
-s reader ssh-add -e reader</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION ssh-add adds RSA or DSA identities to the
authentication agent, ssh-agent(1). When run without
arguments, it adds the files ~/.ssh/id_rsa, ~/.ssh/id_dsa
and ~/.ssh/identity. Alternative file names can be given on
the command line. If any file requires a passphrase, ssh-add
asks for the passphrase from the user. The passphrase is
read from the users tty. ssh-add retries the last passphrase
if multiple identity files are given.</p>

<p>The authentication agent must be running and the
SSH_AUTH_SOCK environ- ment variable must contain the name
of its socket for ssh-add to work.</p>

<p>The options are as follows:</p>

<p>-c Indicates that added identities should be subject to
confirmation before being used for authentication.
Confirmation is performed by the SSH_ASKPASS program
mentioned below. Successful confirma- tion is signaled by a
zero exit status from the SSH_ASKPASS pro- gram, rather than
text entered into the requester.</p>

<p>-D Deletes all identities from the agent.</p>

<p>-d Instead of adding identities, removes identities from
the agent. If ssh-add has been run without arguments, the
keys for the default identities will be removed. Otherwise,
the argument list will be interpreted as a list of paths to
public key files and matching keys will be removed from the
agent. If no public key is found at a given path, ssh-add
will append .pub and retry.</p>

<p>-e reader Remove key in smartcard reader.</p>

<p>-L Lists public key parameters of all identities
currently repre- sented by the agent.</p>

<p>-l Lists fingerprints of all identities currently
represented by the agent.</p>

<p>-s reader Add key in smartcard reader.</p>

<p>-t life Set a maximum lifetime when adding identities to
an agent. The lifetime may be specified in seconds or in a
time format speci- fied in sshd_config(5).</p>

<p>-X Unlock the agent.</p>

<p>-x Lock the agent with a password.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT DISPLAY and SSH_ASKPASS If ssh-add needs a
passphrase, it will read the passphrase from the current
terminal if it was run from a terminal. If ssh-add does not
have a terminal associated with it but DISPLAY and
SSH_ASKPASS are set, it will execute the program specified
by SSH_ASKPASS and open an X11 window to read the
passphrase. This is particularly useful when calling ssh-add
from a .xsession or related script. (Note that on some
machines it may be necessary to redirect the input from
/dev/null to make this work.)</p>

<p>SSH_AUTH_SOCK Identifies the path of a unix-domain
socket used to communicate with the agent.</p>

<p>FILES ~/.ssh/identity Contains the protocol version 1
RSA authentication identity of the user.</p>

<p>~/.ssh/id_dsa Contains the protocol version 2 DSA
authentication identity of the user.</p>

<p>~/.ssh/id_rsa Contains the protocol version 2 RSA
authentication identity of the user.</p>

<p>Identity files should not be readable by anyone but the
user. Note that ssh-add ignores identity files if they are
accessible by others.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS Exit status is 0 on success, 1 if the
specified command fails, and 2 if ssh-add is unable to
contact the authentication agent.</p>

<p>AUTHORS OpenSSH is a derivative of the original and free
ssh 1.2.12 release by Tatu Ylonen. Aaron Campbell, Bob Beck,
Markus Friedl, Niels Provos, Theo de Raadt and Dug Song
removed many bugs, re-added newer features and cre- ated
OpenSSH. Markus Friedl contributed the support for SSH
protocol versions 1.5 and 2.0.</p>
