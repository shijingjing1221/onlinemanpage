<p>SPI_SYNC(9) Serial Peripheral Interface (S
SPI_SYNC(9)</p>

<p>NAME spi_sync - blocking/synchronous SPI data
transfers</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS int spi_sync(struct spi_device * spi, struct
spi_message * message);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS spi device with which data will be
exchanged</p>

<p>message describes the data transfers</p>

<p>CONTEXT can sleep</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This call may only be used from a context
that may sleep. The sleep is non-interruptible, and has no
timeout. Low-overhead controller drivers may DMA directly
into and out of the message buffers.</p>

<p>Note that the SPI device&acute;s chip select is active
during the message, and then is normally disabled between
messages. Drivers for some frequently-used devices may want
to minimize costs of selecting a chip, by leaving it
selected in anticipation that the next message will go to
the same chip. (That may increase power usage.)</p>

<p>Also, the caller is guaranteeing that the memory
associated with the message will not be freed before this
call returns.</p>

<p>It returns zero on success, else a negative error
code.</p>
