<p>NAME xfs_ncheck - generate pathnames from i-numbers for
XFS</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS xfs_ncheck [ -i ino ] ... [ -f ] [ -s ] [ -l
logdev ] device</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION xfs_ncheck with no -i arguments generates an
inode number and pathname list of all files on the given
filesystem. Names of directory files are followed by /.. The
output is not sorted in any particular order. The filesystem
to be examined is specified by the device argument, which
should be the disk or volume device for the filesystem.
Filesystems stored in files can also be checked, using the
-f flag.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -f Specifies that the filesystem image to be
processed is stored in a regular file at device (see the
mkfs.xfs -d file option). This might happen if an image copy
of a filesystem has been made into an ordinary file.</p>

<p>-l logdev Specifies the device where the filesystems
external log resides. Only for those filesystems which use
an external log. See the mkfs.xfs -l option, and refer to
xfs(5) for a detailed description of the XFS log.</p>

<p>-s Limits the report to special files and files with
setuserid mode. This option may be used to detect violations
of secu- rity policy.</p>

<p>-i ino Limits the report to only those files whose inode
numbers fol- low. May be given multiple times to select
multiple inode numbers.</p>

<p>If the filesystem is seriously corrupted, or very busy
and looks like it is corrupt, a message of the form that
would be generated by xfs_check(8) may appear.</p>

<p>xfs_ncheck is only useful with XFS filesystems.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO mkfs.xfs(8), xfs_check(8), xfs(5).</p>
