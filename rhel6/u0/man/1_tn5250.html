<p>NAME tn5250 - an implementation of the 5250 telnet
protocol</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS tn5250 [OPTIONS] HOSTNAME xt5250 [OPTIONS]
HOSTNAME tn5250 -version</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION tn5250 emulates IBMs 5250 compatible
terminals to connect over TCP/IP to an IBM AS/400. The
terminal emulation works on any local terminal supported by
curses, and provides 132x27 and full colour support where
possible.</p>

<p>An IBM 5250 terminal supports a number of special keys,
and does a lot of processing itself before sending data to
the host system. Because a standard ASCII terminal does not
support all these keys, tn5250 uses control sequences to
perform the operations.</p>

<p>Named session support (with the env.DEVNAME option) is
available for most versions of OS/400, but is only supplied
with V4R3 and later ver- sions. For V3R2, V3R7, V4R1 and
V4R2, please see informational APAR II10918.</p>

<p>OPTIONS tn5250 options are described in the tn5250rc(5)
man page.</p>

<p>USAGE This manual assumes that the user is familiar with
a real 5250 termi- nal, or another 5250 emulator, and only
describes features relevant to tn5250 itself.</p>

<p>Keyboard Mapping The following table lists the 5250
functions implemented by tn5250, and the corresponding
keypresses. Keys are represented as Emacs does: C-a means
hold Ctrl and press A, M-a means press Esc or C-g followed
by A, and C-M-a means press Esc or C-g followed by C-a. Most
setups also let you use the Alt or Meta key for M-
keypresses.</p>

<p>Function Keypress
---------------------------------------- F1 - F10 f1 to f10,
M-1 to M- F11 f11 [1], M-- F12 f12 [1], M-= F13 - F24 f13 to
f24 [1], M-! to M-+ Enter return, enter, C-j, C-m Left left
Right right Up up Down down Roll Up next, pagedown, C-d, C-f
Roll Down prev, pageup, C-b, C-u Backspace backspace [1]
Home home, C-o End end Insert insert, M-i, M-delete Delete
delete [1] Reset C-r, M-r Print C-p, M-p Help M-h</p>

<p>SysReq C-c, M-s Clear M-c FieldExit C-k, M-x TestReq C-t
Toggle M-t Erase C-e Attn C-a, M-a Dup M-d Field+ C-x, + [2]
Field- M-m, - [2] NewLine C-M-j Next Field tab, C-i Prev
Field backtab [1] ----------------------------------------
Refresh C-l, M-l Quit C-q</p>

<p>1. Which keys generate f11-f24, backtab, backspace and
delete is very dependent on the configuration of the
terminal.</p>

<p>2. + and - only work as Field+ and Field- in signed
numeric fields.</p>

<p>Display The screen display tries to be the same as a
colour 5250 terminal. There are some unavoidable differences
though:</p>

<p>&middot; ASCII terminals (and curses) do not support the
5250 column separa- tors.</p>

<p>&middot; Some terminals (mostly ones based on the VGA
text mode) do not sup- port underlining. If this is the case
and tn5250 does not detect it automatically, you should pass
the -u option.</p>

<p>&middot; Some terminals (such as xterm) do not support
blinking text.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES These are some examples of the use of
tn5250:</p>

<p>tn5250 as400sys Connect to the system as400sys, using
the default translation map (37) and a generated session
name (QPADEV####).</p>

<p>tn5250 map=870 env.DEVNAME=session1 env.TERM=IBM-3477-FC
as400sys Connect to as400sys using the translation map for
CCSID 870 (Eastern Europe), the session name SESSION1 and
with a terminal supporting colour and a 132x27 display.</p>
