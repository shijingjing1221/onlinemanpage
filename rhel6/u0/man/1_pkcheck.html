<p>NAME pkcheck - Check whether a process is authorized</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pkcheck [--version] [--help]</p>

<p>pkcheck --action-id action {--process { pid |
pid,pid-start-time } | --system-bus-name busname}
[--allow-user-interaction] [--detail key value...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pkcheck is used to check whether a process,
specified by either --process or --system-bus-name, is
authorized for action. The --detail option can be used zero
or more times to pass details about action. If
--allow-user-interaction is passed, pkcheck blocks while
waiting for authentication.</p>

<p>This command is a simple wrapper around the PolicyKit
D-Bus interface; see the D-Bus interface documentation for
details.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE If the specified process is authorized,
pkcheck exits with a return value of 0. If the authorization
result contains any details, these are printed on standard
output as key/value pairs using environment style reporting,
e.g. first the key followed by a an equal sign, then the
value followed by a newline.</p>

<p>KEY1=VALUE1 KEY2=VALUE2 KEY3=VALUE3 ...</p>

<p>Octects that are not in [a-zA-Z0-9_] are escaped using
octal codes prefixed with . For example, the UTF-8 string
f&oslash;l, 你 好 will be printed as
f303270l54344275240345245275.</p>

<p>If the specificied process is not authorized, pkcheck
exits with a return value of 1 and a diagnostic message is
printed on standard error. Details are printed on standard
output.</p>

<p>If the specificied process is not authorized because no
suitable authentication agent is available or if the
--allow-user-interaction wasn&acute;t passed, pkcheck exits
with a return value of 2 and a diagnostic message is printed
on standard error. Details are printed on standard
output.</p>

<p>If an error occured while checking for authorization,
pkcheck exits with a return value of 127 with a diagnostic
message printed on standard error.</p>

<p>If one or more of the options passed are malformed,
pkcheck exits with a return value of 126. If stdin is a tty,
then this manual page is also shown.</p>

<p>NOTES Since process identifiers can be recycled, the
caller should always use pid,pid-start-time to specify the
process to check for authorization when using the --process
option. The value of pid-start-time can be determined by
consulting e.g. the proc(5) file system depending on the
operating system. If only pid is passed to the --process
option, then pkcheck will look up the start time itself but
note that this may be racy.</p>
