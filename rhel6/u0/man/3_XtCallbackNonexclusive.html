<p>XtPopup(3) XT FUNCTIONS XtPopup(3)</p>

<p>NAME XtPopup, XtPopupSpringLoaded, XtCallbackNone,
XtCallbackNonexclusive, XtCallbackExclusive - map a
pop-up</p>

<p>SYNTAX void XtPopup(Widget popup_shell, XtGrabKind
grab_kind);</p>

<p>void XtPopupSpringLoaded(Widget popup_shell);</p>

<p>void XtCallbackNone(Widget w, XtPointer client_data,
XtPointer call_data):</p>

<p>void XtCallbackNonexclusive(Widget w, XtPointer
client_data, XtPointer call_data);</p>

<p>void XtCallbackExclusive(Widget w, XtPointer
client_data, XtPointer call_data);</p>

<p>void MenuPopup(String shell_name);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS call_data Specifies the callback data, which
is not used by this proce- dure.</p>

<p>client_data Specifies the pop-up shell.</p>

<p>grab_kind Specifies the way in which user events should
be constrained.</p>

<p>popup_shell Specifies the widget shell.</p>

<p>w Specifies the widget.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The XtPopup function performs the
following:</p>

<p>&middot; Calls XtCheckSubclass to ensure popup_shell is
a subclass of Shell.</p>

<p>&middot; Generates an error if the shells popped_up
field is already True.</p>

<p>&middot; Calls the callback procedures on the shell s
popup_callback list.</p>

<p>&middot; Sets the shell popped_up field to True, the
shell spring_loaded field to False, and the shell grab_kind
field from grab_kind.</p>

<p>&middot; If the shells create_popup_child field is
non-NULL, XtPopup calls it with popup_shell as the
parameter.</p>

<p>&middot; If grab_kind is either XtGrabNonexclusive or
XtGrabExclusive, it calls:</p>

<p>XtAddGrab(popup_shell, (grab_kind == XtGrabExclusive),
False)</p>

<p>&middot; Calls XtRealizeWidget with popup_shell
specified.</p>

<p>&middot; Calls XMapWindow with popup_shell
specified.</p>

<p>The XtPopupSpringLoaded function performs exactly as
XtPopup except that it sets the shell spring_loaded field to
True and always calls XtAddGrab with exclusive True and
spring_loaded True.</p>

<p>The XtCallbackNone, XtCallbackNonexclusive, and
XtCallbackExclusive functions call XtPopup with the shell
specified by the client data argument and grab_kind set as
the name specifies. XtCallbackNone, XtCallbackNonexclusive,
and XtCallbackExclusive specify XtGrabNone,
XtGrabNonexclusive, and XtGrabExclusive, respectively. Each
function then sets the widget that executed the callback
list to be insensitive by using XtSetSensitive. Using these
functions in callbacks is not required. In particular, an
application must provide customized code for callbacks that
create pop-up shells dynamically or that must do more than
desensitizing the button.</p>

<p>MenuPopup is known to the translation manager, which
must perform spe- cial actions for spring-loaded pop-ups.
Calls to MenuPopup in a trans- lation specification are
mapped into calls to a nonexported action pro- cedure, and
the translation manager fills in parameters based on the
event specified on the left-hand side of a translation.</p>

<p>If MenuPopup is invoked on ButtonPress (possibly with
modifiers), the translation manager pops up the shell with
grab_kind set to XtGrabEx- clusive and spring_loaded set to
True. If MenuPopup is invoked on EnterWindow (possibly with
modifiers), the translation manager pops up the shell with
grab_kind set to XtGrabNonexclusive and spring_loaded set to
False. Otherwise, the translation manager generates an
error. When the widget is popped up, the following actions
occur:</p>

<p>&middot; Calls XtCheckSubclass to ensure popup_shell is
a subclass of Shell.</p>

<p>&middot; Generates an error if the shells popped_up
field is already True.</p>

<p>&middot; Calls the callback procedures on the shell s
popup_callback list.</p>

<p>&middot; Sets the shell popped_up field to True and the
shell grab_kind and spring_loaded fields appropriately.</p>

<p>&middot; If the shells create_popup_child field is
non-NULL, it is called with popup_shell as the
parameter.</p>

<p>&middot; Calls:</p>

<p>XtAddGrab(popup_shell, (grab_kind == XtGrabExclusive),
spring_loaded)</p>

<p>&middot; Calls XtRealizeWidget with popup_shell
specified.</p>

<p>&middot; Calls XMapWindow with popup_shell
specified.</p>

<p>(Note that these actions are the same as those for
XtPopup.) MenuPopup tries to find the shell by searching the
widget tree starting at the parent of the widget in which it
is invoked. If it finds a shell with the specified name in
the pop-up children of that parent, it pops up the shell
with the appropriate parameters. Otherwise, it moves up the
parent chain as needed. If MenuPopup gets to the application
widget and cannot find a matching shell, it generates an
error.</p>
