<p>NAME lldpad - Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) agent
daemon</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS lldpad [-h] [-v] [-d] [-k] [-s] [-f
filename]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Executes the LLDP protocol for supported
network interfaces. The list of TLVs currently supported
are:</p>

<p>- IEEE 802.1AB Mandatory TLVs</p>

<p>- IEEE 802.1AB Basic Management TLVs</p>

<p>- IEEE 802.3 Organizationally Specific TLVs</p>

<p>- LLDP-MED Organizationally Specific TLVs</p>

<p>- Data Center Bridging capabilities exchange protocol
(DCBX) TLVs</p>

<p>Capabilities of lldpad include:</p>

<p>- Transmission of LLDP PDUs containing enabled TLVs from
enabled ports.</p>

<p>- Reception of LLDP PDUs from enabled ports.</p>

<p>- Operation of the DCBX protocol for interfaces which
support the DCB rtnetlink interface. This includes operation
of the DCBX state machines above LLDP and corresponding
configuration of the DCB parameters of the network
interface. Supported DCB features are: Extended Transmission
Selection, Priority Flow Control and the FCoE
application.</p>

<p>- Configuring the DCB settings of the network driver
based on the operation of DCBX.</p>

<p>- Provides a multi-channel interface for client
applications to query and configure features. Events are
also generated on the client interface to inform clients of
changes. The lldpad pack- age includes two clients: lldptool
for general LLDP agent man- agement and dcbtool for DCB
management.</p>

<p>lldpad supports the versions of the DCB capabilities
exchange (DCBX) protocol described here:</p>

<p>version 1
&lt;http://download.intel.com/technology/eedc/dcb_cep_spec.pdf&gt;</p>

<p>and here:</p>

<p>version 2 - also known as CEE DCBX
&lt;http://www.ieee802.org/1/files/public/docs2008/az-wadekar-dcbx-
capability-exchange-discovery-protocol-1108-v1.01.pdf&gt;</p>

<p>See dcbtool for information on how to configure which
version of DCBX lldpad executes.</p>

<p>OPTIONS lldpad has the following command line
options:</p>

<p>-h show usage information</p>

<p>-f filename use the specified file as the configuration
file instead of the default file:
/var/lib/lldpad/lldpad.conf lldpad expects the directory of
the configuration file to exist, but if the config- uration
file does not exist, then a default configuration file will
be created. lldpad creates and maintains the contents of the
configuration file. Configuration should be performed by
using lldptool or dcbtool.</p>

<p>-d run lldpad as a daemon</p>

<p>-v show lldpad version</p>

<p>-k used to terminate the first instance of lldpad that
was started (e.g. from initrd). Once lldpad -k has been
invoked and lldpad has been restarted, subsequent
invocations of lldpad -k will not terminate lldpad.</p>

<p>-s remove lldpad state records from shared memory</p>
