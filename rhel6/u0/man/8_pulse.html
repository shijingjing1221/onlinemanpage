<p>NAME pulse - heartbeating daemon for monitoring the
health of cluster nodes</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pulse [-c file|--configfile= file]
[-n|--nodaemon] [--forceactive] [--lvs= path] [--fos= path]
[-v|--verbose] [-t|--test-start] [--norun] [-?|--help]
[--usage] [--version]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pulse is a daemon used by lvsd nodes to
monitor one anothers health and to initiate the failover of
the lvsd or fos daemon. It makes use of the lvs.cf(5)
configuration file for items such as length of time between
heartbeats and length of time before declaring the remote
server to be dead and initiate a failover.</p>

<p>pulse, which runs on the primary and backup nodes, is
used by each to determine that the other is still alive. If
the backup node fails to receive a heartbeat from the
primary node after a set amount of time (specified in
lvs.cf), it will assume ownership of all virtual ser-
vice(s) being provided by the primary node. Its takeover
process includes bringing up aliased device(s) for all
virtual service(s) as well as sending out gratuitous ARPs to
associate the floating IP(s) with the MAC address of the
backup node.</p>

<p>If and when a failed primary node returns to a
functioning status, it assumes the backup role unless
specifically forced to assume the pri- mary role. To reduce
the number of faults seen by clients and avoid the breaking
persistent client connections, you should minimize the
number of failovers.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -c file|--configfile= file Normally, pulse uses
lvs.cf as its configuration file, but this can be overridden
and another file can be used.</p>

<p>-n|--nodaemon Normally, pulse runs as a daemon but with
this option runs in the foreground. When running in this
mode, pulse sends all out- put to STDOUT instead of to
syslog.</p>

<p>--forceactive When this flag is used, the machine that
pulse runs on will forceably take over as the primary lvsd
router and other machine will become the backup.</p>

<p>--lvs= path By default, pulse looks in /usr/sbin for
lvsd; use path to tell pulse to look elsewhere for the
program.</p>

<p>--fos= path By default, pulse looks in /usr/sbin for
fos; use path to tell pulse to look elsewhere for the
program.</p>

<p>-t|--test-start Runs pulse in a test mode. Reports, but
does not actually start, the rest of the daemom processes
(lvsd, fos, etc.).</p>

<p>--norun Historical. Same as --test-start.</p>

<p>-v|--verbose Displays debugging information</p>

<p>-?|--help Shows a verbose usage listing.</p>

<p>--usage Outputs a terse argument summary.</p>

<p>--version Displays program version.</p>
