<p>METAFLAC(1) METAFLAC(1)</p>

<p>NAME metaflac - program to list, add, remove, or edit
metadata in one or more FLAC files.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS metaflac [ options ] [ operations ] FLACfile
...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Use metaflac to list, add, remove, or edit
metadata in one or more FLAC files. You may perform one
major operation, or many shorthand opera- tions at a
time.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --preserve-modtime Preserve the original
modification time in spite of edits.</p>

<p>--with-filename Prefix each output line with the FLAC
file name (the default if more than one FLAC file is
specified).</p>

<p>--no-filename Do not prefix each output line with the
FLAC file name (the default if only one FLAC file is
specified).</p>

<p>--no-utf8-convert Do not convert tags from UTF-8 to
local charset, or vice versa. This is useful for scripts,
and setting tags in situations where the locale is
wrong.</p>

<p>--dont-use-padding By default metaflac tries to use
padding where possible to avoid rewriting the entire file if
the metadata size changes. Use this option to tell metaflac
to not take advantage of padding this way.</p>

<p>SHORTHAND OPERATIONS --show-md5sum Show the MD5
signature from the STREAMINFO block.</p>

<p>--show-min-blocksize Show the minimum block size from
the STREAMINFO block.</p>

<p>--show-max-blocksize Show the maximum block size from
the STREAMINFO block.</p>

<p>--show-min-framesize Show the minimum frame size from
the STREAMINFO block.</p>

<p>--show-max-framesize Show the maximum frame size from
the STREAMINFO block.</p>

<p>--show-sample-rate Show the sample rate from the
STREAMINFO block.</p>

<p>--show-channels Show the number of channels from the
STREAMINFO block.</p>

<p>--show-bps Show the # of bits per sample from the
STREAMINFO block.</p>

<p>--show-total-samples Show the total # of samples from
the STREAMINFO block.</p>

<p>--show-vendor-tag Show the vendor string from the
VORBIS_COMMENT block.</p>

<p>--show-tag=name Show all tags where the the field name
matches name .</p>

<p>--remove-tag=name Remove all tags whose field name is
name.</p>

<p>--remove-first-tag=name Remove first tag whose field
name is name.</p>

<p>--remove-all-tags Remove all tags, leaving only the
vendor string.</p>

<p>--set-tag=field Add a tag. The field must comply with
the Vorbis comment spec, of the form &quot;NAME=VALUE&quot;.
If there is currently no tag block, one will be created.</p>

<p>--set-tag-from-file=field Like --set-tag, except the
VALUE is a filename whose contents will be read verbatim to
set the tag value. Unless --no- utf8-convert is specified,
the contents will be converted to UTF-8 from the local
charset. This can be used to store a cuesheet in a tag (e.g.
--set-tag-from- file=&quot;CUESHEET=image.cue&quot;). Do not
try to store binary data in tag fields! Use APPLICATION
blocks for that.</p>

<p>--import-tags-from=file Import tags from a file. Use -
for stdin. Each line should be of the form NAME=VALUE.
Multi-line comments are currently not supported. Specify
--remove-all-tags and/or --no-utf8-con- vert before
--import-tags-from if necessary. If FILE is - (stdin), only
one FLAC file may be specified.</p>

<p>--export-tags-to=file Export tags to a file. Use - for
stdout. Each line will be of the form NAME=VALUE. Specify
--no-utf8-convert if necessary.</p>

<p>--import-cuesheet-from=file Import a cuesheet from a
file. Use - for stdin. Only one FLAC file may be specified.
A seekpoint will be added for each index point in the
cuesheet to the SEEKTABLE unless --no-cued- seekpoints is
specified.</p>

<p>--export-cuesheet-to=file Export CUESHEET block to a
cuesheet file, suitable for use by CD authoring software.
Use - for stdout. Only one FLAC file may be specified on the
command line.</p>

<p>--import-picture-from={FILENAME|SPECIFICATION} Import a
picture and store it in a PICTURE metadata block. More than
one --import-picture-from command can be specified. Either a
filename for the picture file or a more complete
specification form can be used. The SPECIFICATION is a
string whose parts are separated by | (pipe) characters.
Some parts may be left empty to invoke default values.
FILENAME is just shorthand for &quot;||||FILENAME&quot;. The
format of SPECIFICATION is</p>


<p>[TYPE]|[MIME-TYPE]|[DESCRIPTION]|[WIDTHxHEIGHTxDEPTH[/COL-
ORS]]|FILE</p>

<p>TYPE is optional; it is a number from one of:</p>

<p>0: Other</p>

<p>1: 32x32 pixels file icon (PNG only)</p>

<p>2: Other file icon</p>

<p>3: Cover (front)</p>

<p>4: Cover (back)</p>

<p>5: Leaflet page</p>

<p>6: Media (e.g. label side of CD)</p>

<p>7: Lead artist/lead performer/soloist</p>

<p>8: Artist/performer</p>

<p>9: Conductor</p>

<p>10: Band/Orchestra</p>

<p>11: Composer</p>

<p>12: Lyricist/text writer</p>

<p>13: Recording Location</p>

<p>14: During recording</p>

<p>15: During performance</p>

<p>16: Movie/video screen capture</p>

<p>17: A bright coloured fish</p>

<p>18: Illustration</p>

<p>19: Band/artist logotype</p>

<p>20: Publisher/Studio logotype</p>

<p>The default is 3 (front cover). There may only be one
picture each of type 1 and 2 in a file.</p>

<p>MIME-TYPE is optional; if left blank, it will be
detected from the file. For best compatibility with players,
use pictures with MIME type image/jpeg or image/png. The
MIME type can also be --&gt; to mean that FILE is actually a
URL to an image, though this use is discouraged.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION is optional; the default is an empty
string.</p>

<p>The next part specfies the resolution and color
information. If the MIME-TYPE is image/jpeg, image/png, or
image/gif, you can usually leave this empty and they can be
detected from the file. Otherwise, you must specify the
width in pixels, height in pix- els, and color depth in
bits-per-pixel. If the image has indexed colors you should
also specify the number of colors used. When manually
specified, it is not checked against the file for
accuracy.</p>

<p>FILE is the path to the picture file to be imported, or
the URL if MIME type is --&gt;</p>

<p>For example, &quot;|image/jpeg|||../cover.jpg&quot; will
embed the JPEG file at ../cover.jpg, defaulting to type 3
(front cover) and an empty description. The resolution and
color info will be retrieved from the file itself.</p>

<p>The specification
&quot;4|--&gt;|CD|320x300x24/173|http://blah.blah/backcover.tiff&quot;
will embed the given URL, with type 4 (back cover),
description &quot;CD&quot;, and a manually specified
resolution of 320x300, 24 bits-per- pixel, and 173 colors.
The file at the URL will not be fetched; the URL itself is
stored in the PICTURE metadata block.</p>

<p>--export-picture-to=file Export PICTURE block to a file.
Use - for stdout. Only one FLAC file may be specified on the
command line. The first PIC- TURE block will be exported
unless --export-picture-to is pre- ceded by a
--block-number=# option to specify the exact metadata block
to extract. Note that the block number is the one shown by
--list.</p>

<p>--add-replay-gain Calculates the title and album
gains/peaks of the given FLAC files as if all the files were
part of one album, then stores them as FLAC tags. The tags
are the same as those used by vor- bisgain. Existing
ReplayGain tags will be replaced. If only one FLAC file is
given, the album and title gains will be the same. Since
this operation requires two passes, it is always executed
last, after all other operations have been completed and
written to disk. All FLAC files specified must have the same
resolution, sample rate, and number of channels. The sam-
ple rate must be one of 8, 11.025, 12, 16, 22.05, 24, 32,
44.1, or 48 kHz.</p>

<p>--remove-replay-gain Removes the ReplayGain tags.</p>

<p>--add-seekpoint={#|X|#x|#s} Add seek points to a
SEEKTABLE block. Using #, a seek point at that sample number
is added. Using X, a placeholder point is added at the end
of a the table. Using #x, # evenly spaced seek points will
be added, the first being at sample 0. Using #s, a seekpoint
will be added every # seconds (# does not have to be a whole
number; it can be, for example, 9.5, meaning a seekpoint
every 9.5 seconds). If no SEEKTABLE block exists, one will
be created. If one already exists, points will be added to
the existing table, and any duplicates will be turned into
place- holder points. You may use many --add-seekpoint
options; the resulting SEEKTABLE will be the unique-ified
union of all such values. Example: --add-seekpoint=100x
--add-seekpoint=3.5s will add 100 evenly spaced seekpoints
and a seekpoint every 3.5 sec- onds.</p>

<p>--add-padding=length Add a padding block of the given
length (in bytes). The overall length of the new block will
be 4 + length; the extra 4 bytes is for the metadata block
header.</p>

<p>MAJOR OPERATIONS --list List the contents of one or more
metadata blocks to stdout. By default, all metadata blocks
are listed in text format. Use the following options to
change this behavior:</p>

<p>--block-number=#[,#[...]] An optional comma-separated
list of block numbers to dis- play. The first block, the
STREAMINFO block, is block 0.</p>

<p>--block-type=type[,type[...]]</p>

<p>--except-block-type=type[,type[...]] An optional
comma-separated list of block types to be included or
ignored with this option. Use only one of --block-type or
--except-block-type. The valid block types are: STREAMINFO,
PADDING, APPLICATION, SEEKTABLE, VORBIS_COMMENT. You may
narrow down the types of APPLICATION blocks displayed as
follows:</p>

<p>APPLICATION:abcd The APPLICATION block(s) whose textual
repre- sentation of the 4-byte ID is &quot;abcd&quot;
APPLICATION:0xXXXXXXXX The APPLICATION block(s) whose
hexadecimal big- endian representation of the 4-byte ID is
&quot;0xXXXXXXXX&quot;. For the example &quot;abcd&quot;
above the hex- adecimal equivalalent is 0x61626364</p>

<p>Note: if both --block-number and --[except-]block-type
are specified, the result is the logical AND of both
arguments.</p>

<p>--application-data-format=hexdump|text If the
application block you are displaying contains binary data
but your --data-format=text, you can display a hex dump of
the application data contents instead using
--application-data-format=hexdump.</p>

<p>--remove Remove one or more metadata blocks from the
metadata. Unless --dont-use-padding is specified, the blocks
will be replaced with padding. You may not remove the
STREAMINFO block.</p>

<p>--block-number=#[,#[...]]</p>

<p>--block-type=type[,type[...]]</p>

<p>--except-block-type=type[,type[...]] See --list above
for usage.</p>

<p>Note: if both --block-number and --[except-]block-type
are specified, the result is the logical AND of both
arguments.</p>

<p>--remove-all Remove all metadata blocks (except the
STREAMINFO block) from the metadata. Unless
--dont-use-padding is specified, the blocks will be replaced
with padding.</p>

<p>--merge-padding Merge adjacent PADDING blocks into
single blocks.</p>

<p>--sort-padding Move all PADDING blocks to the end of the
metadata and merge them into a single block.</p>
