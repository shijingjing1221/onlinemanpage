<p>NAME xload - system load average display for X</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS xload [-toolkitoption ...] [-scale integer]
[-update seconds] [-hl color] [-highlight color] [-remote
host] [-jumpscroll pixels] [-label string] [-nolabel]
[-lights]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The xload program displays a periodically
updating histogram of the system load average.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Xload accepts all of the standard X Toolkit
command line options (see X(7)). The order of the options in
unimportant. xload also accepts the following additional
options:</p>

<p>-hl color or -highlight color This option specifies the
color of the scale lines.</p>

<p>-jumpscroll number of pixels The number of pixels to
shift the graph to the left when the graph reaches the right
edge of the window. The default value is 1/2 the width of
the current window. Smooth scrolling can be achieved by
setting it to 1.</p>

<p>-label string The string to put into the label above the
load average.</p>

<p>-nolabel If this command line option is specified then
no label will be displayed above the load graph.</p>

<p>-lights When specified, this option causes xload to
display the current load average by using the keyboard leds;
for a load average of n, xload lights the first n keyboard
leds. This option turns off the usual screen display.</p>

<p>-scale integer This option specifies the minimum number
of tick marks in the histogram, where one division
represents one load average point. If the load goes above
this number, xload will create more divisions, but it will
never use fewer than this number. The default is 1.</p>

<p>-update seconds This option specifies the interval in
seconds at which xload updates its display. The minimum
amount of time allowed between updates is 1 second. The
default is 10.</p>

<p>-remote host This option tells xload to display the load
of host instead of localhost. Xload gets the information
from the rwhod database and consequently requires rwhod to
be executing both on local- host and host.</p>

<p>RESOURCES In addition to the resources available to each
of the widgets used by xload there is one resource defined
by the application itself.</p>

<p>showLabel (class Boolean) If False then no label will be
displayed.</p>

<p>WIDGETS In order to specify resources, it is useful to
know the hierarchy of the widgets which compose xload. In
the notation below, indentation indicates hierarchical
structure. The widget class name is given first, followed by
the widget instance name.</p>

<p>XLoad xload Paned paned Label label StripChart load</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT DISPLAY to get the default host and display
number.</p>

<p>XENVIRONMENT to get the name of a resource file that
overrides the global resources stored in the
RESOURCE_MANAGER property.</p>

<p>FILES /usr/share/X11/app-defaults/XLoad specifies
required resources</p>

Widget.</p>

<p>BUGS This program requires the ability to open and read
the special system file /dev/kmem. Sites that do not allow
general access to this file should make xload belong to the
same group as /dev/kmem and turn on the set group id
permission flag.</p>

<p>Reading /dev/kmem is inherently non-portable. Therefore,
the routine used to read it (get_load.c) must be ported to
each new operating sys- tem.</p>
