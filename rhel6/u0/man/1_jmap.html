<p>NAME jmap - Memory Map</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS jmap [ option ] pid jmap [ option ] executable
core jmap [ option ] [server-id@]remote-hostname-or-IP</p>

<p>PARAMETERS option Options are mutually exclusive.
Option, if used, should follow imme- diately after the
command name.</p>

<p>pid process id for which the memory map is to be
printed. The process must be a Java process. To get a list
of Java processes running on a machine, jps may be used.</p>

<p>executable Java executable from which the core dump was
produced.</p>

<p>core core file for which the memory map is to be
printed.</p>

<p>remote-hostname-or-IP remote debug servers (see
jsadebugd) hostname or IP address.</p>

<p>server-id optional unique id, if multiple debug servers
are running on the same remote host.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION jmap prints shared object memory maps or
heap memory details of a given process or core file or a
remote debug server. If the given process is running on a
64-bit VM, you may need to specify the -J-d64 option,
e.g.:</p>

<p>jmap -J-d64 -heap pid</p>

<p>NOTE - This utility is unsupported and may or may not be
available in future versions of the JDK.</p>

<p>The only forms of jmap available on the Windows platform
are</p>

<p>jmap -dump:&lt;dump-options&gt; pid and</p>

<p>jmap -histo[:live] pid</p>

<p>OPTIONS &lt;no option&gt; When no option is used jmap
prints shared object mappings. For each shared object loaded
in the target VM, start address, the size of the mapping,
and the full path of the shared object file are printed.
This is similar to the Solaris pmap utility.</p>

<p>-dump:[live,]format=b,file=&lt;filename&gt; Dumps the
Java heap in hprof binary format to filename. The live
suboption is optional. If specified, only the live objects
in the heap are dumped. To browse the heap dump, you can use
jhat (Java Heap Analysis Tool) to read the generated
file.</p>

<p>-finalizerinfo Prints information on objects awaiting
finalization.</p>

<p>-heap Prints a heap summary. GC algorithm used, heap
configuration and generation wise heap usage are
printed.</p>

<p>-histo[:live] Prints a histogram of the heap. For each
Java class, number of objects, memory size in bytes, and
fully qualified class names are printed. VM internal class
names are printed with * prefix. If the live suboption is
specified, only live objects are counted.</p>

<p>-permstat Prints class loader wise statistics of
permanent generation of Java heap. For each class loader,
its name, liveness, address, parent class loader, and the
number and size of classes it has loaded are printed. In
addition, the number and size of interned Strings are
printed.</p>

<p>-F Force. Use with jmap -dump or jmap -histo option if
the pid does not respond. The live suboption is not
supported in this mode.</p>

<p>-h Prints a help message.</p>

<p>-help Prints a help message.</p>

<p>-J&lt;flag&gt; Passes &lt;flag&gt; to the Java virtual
machine on which jmap is run.</p>
