<p>DESCRIPTION objdump displays information about one or
more object files. The options control what particular
information to display. This information is mostly useful to
programmers who are working on the compilation tools, as
opposed to programmers who just want their program to
compile and work.</p>

<p>objfile... are the object files to be examined. When you
specify archives, objdump shows information on each of the
member object files.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The long and short forms of options, shown here
as alternatives, are equivalent. At least one option from
the list
-a,-d,-D,-e,-f,-g,-G,-h,-H,-p,-r,-R,-s,-S,-t,-T,-V,-x must
be given.</p>

<p>-a --archive-header If any of the objfile files are
archives, display the archive header information (in a
format similar to ls -l). Besides the information you could
list with ar tv, objdump -a shows the object file format of
each archive member.</p>

<p>--adjust-vma=offset When dumping information, first add
offset to all the section addresses. This is useful if the
section addresses do not correspond to the symbol table,
which can happen when putting sections at particular
addresses when using a format which can not represent
section addresses, such as a.out.</p>

<p>-b bfdname --target=bfdname Specify that the object-code
format for the object files is bfdname. This option may not
be necessary; objdump can automatically recognize many
formats.</p>

<p>For example,</p>

<p>objdump -b oasys -m vax -h fu.o</p>

<p>displays summary information from the section headers
(-h) of fu.o, which is explicitly identified (-m) as a VAX
object file in the format produced by Oasys compilers. You
can list the formats available with the -i option.</p>

<p>-C --demangle[=style] Decode (demangle) low-level symbol
names into user-level names. Besides removing any initial
underscore prepended by the system, this makes C++ function
names readable. Different compilers have different mangling
styles. The optional demangling style argument can be used
to choose an appropriate demangling style for your
compiler.</p>

<p>-g --debugging Display debugging information. This
attempts to parse STABS and IEEE debugging format
information stored in the file and print it out using a C
like syntax. If neither of these formats are found this
option falls back on the -W option to print any DWARF
information in the file.</p>

<p>-e --debugging-tags Like -g, but the information is
generated in a format compatible with ctags tool.</p>

<p>-d --disassemble Display the assembler mnemonics for the
machine instructions from objfile. This option only
disassembles those sections which are expected to contain
instructions.</p>

<p>-D --disassemble-all Like -d, but disassemble the
contents of all sections, not just those expected to contain
instructions.</p>

<p>If the target is an ARM architecture this switch also
has the effect of forcing the disassembler to decode pieces
of data found in code sections as if they were
instructions.</p>

<p>--prefix-addresses When disassembling, print the
complete address on each line. This is the older disassembly
format.</p>

<p>-EB -EL --endian={big|little} Specify the endianness of
the object files. This only affects disassembly. This can be
useful when disassembling a file format which does not
describe endianness information, such as S-records.</p>

<p>-f --file-headers Display summary information from the
overall header of each of the objfile files.</p>

<p>-F --file-offsets When disassembling sections, whenever
a symbol is displayed, also display the file offset of the
region of data that is about to be dumped. If zeroes are
being skipped, then when disassembly resumes, tell the user
how many zeroes were skipped and the file offset of the
location from where the disassembly resumes. When dumping
sections, display the file offset of the location from where
the dump starts.</p>

<p>--file-start-context Specify that when displaying
interlisted source code/disassembly (assumes -S) from a file
that has not yet been displayed, extend the context to the
start of the file.</p>

<p>-h --section-headers --headers Display summary
information from the section headers of the object file.</p>

<p>File segments may be relocated to nonstandard addresses,
for example by using the -Ttext, -Tdata, or -Tbss options to
ld. However, some object file formats, such as a.out, do not
store the starting address of the file segments. In those
situations, although ld relocates the sections correctly,
using objdump -h to list the file section headers cannot
show the correct addresses. Instead, it shows the usual
addresses, which are implicit for the target.</p>

<p>-H --help Print a summary of the options to objdump and
exit.</p>

<p>-i --info Display a list showing all architectures and
object formats available for specification with -b or
-m.</p>

<p>-j name --section=name Display information only for
section name.</p>

<p>-l --line-numbers Label the display (using debugging
information) with the filename and source line numbers
corresponding to the object code or relocs shown. Only
useful with -d, -D, or -r.</p>

<p>-m machine --architecture=machine Specify the
architecture to use when disassembling object files. This
can be useful when disassembling object files which do not
describe architecture information, such as S-records. You
can list the available architectures with the -i option.</p>

<p>If the target is an ARM architecture then this switch
has an additional effect. It restricts the disassembly to
only those instructions supported by the architecture
specified by machine. If it is necessary to use this switch
because the input file does not contain any architecture
information, but it is also desired to disassemble all the
instructions use -marm.</p>

<p>-M options --disassembler-options=options Pass target
specific information to the disassembler. Only supported on
some targets. If it is necessary to specify more than one
disassembler option then multiple -M options can be used or
can be placed together into a comma separated list.</p>

<p>If the target is an ARM architecture then this switch
can be used to select which register name set is used during
disassembler. Specifying -M reg-names-std (the default) will
select the register names as used in ARMs instruction set
documentation, but with register 13 called sp , register 14
called lr and register 15 called pc. Specifying -M
reg-names-apcs will select the name set used by the ARM
Procedure Call Standard, whilst specifying -M reg- names-raw
will just use r followed by the register number.</p>

<p>There are also two variants on the APCS register naming
scheme enabled by -M reg-names-atpcs and -M
reg-names-special-atpcs which use the ARM/Thumb Procedure
Call Standard naming conventions. (Either with the normal
register names or the special register names).</p>

<p>This option can also be used for ARM architectures to
force the disassembler to interpret all instructions as
Thumb instructions by using the switch
--disassembler-options=force-thumb. This can be useful when
attempting to disassemble thumb code produced by other
compilers.</p>

<p>For the x86, some of the options duplicate functions of
the -m switch, but allow finer grained control. Multiple
selections from the following may be specified as a comma
separated string. x86-64, i386 and i8086 select disassembly
for the given architecture. intel and att select between
intel syntax mode and AT&amp;T syntax mode. intel-mnemonic
and att-mnemonic select between intel mnemonic mode and
AT&amp;T mnemonic mode. intel-mnemonic implies intel and
att-mnemonic implies att. addr64, addr32, addr16, data32 and
data16 specify the default address size and operand size.
These four options will be overridden if x86-64, i386 or
i8086 appear later in the option string. Lastly, suffix,
when in AT&amp;T mode, instructs the disassembler to print a
mnemonic suffix even when the suffix could be inferred by
the operands.</p>

<p>For PowerPC, booke controls the disassembly of BookE
instructions. 32 and 64 select PowerPC and PowerPC64
disassembly, respectively. e300 selects disassembly for the
e300 family. 440 selects disassembly for the PowerPC 440.
ppcps selects disassembly for the paired single instructions
of the PPC750CL.</p>

<p>For MIPS, this option controls the printing of
instruction mnemonic names and register names in
disassembled instructions. Multiple selections from the
following may be specified as a comma separated string, and
invalid options are ignored:</p>

<p>&quot;no-aliases&quot; Print the raw instruction
mnemonic instead of some pseudo instruction mnemonic. I.e.,
print daddu or or instead of move, sll instead of nop,
etc.</p>

<p>&quot;gpr-names=ABI&quot; Print GPR (general-purpose
register) names as appropriate for the specified ABI. By
default, GPR names are selected according to the ABI of the
binary being disassembled.</p>

<p>&quot;fpr-names=ABI&quot; Print FPR (floating-point
register) names as appropriate for the specified ABI. By
default, FPR numbers are printed rather than names.</p>

<p>&quot;cp0-names=ARCH&quot; Print CP0 (system control
coprocessor; coprocessor 0) register names as appropriate
for the CPU or architecture specified by ARCH. By default,
CP0 register names are selected according to the
architecture and CPU of the binary being disassembled.</p>

<p>&quot;hwr-names=ARCH&quot; Print HWR (hardware register,
used by the &quot;rdhwr&quot; instruction) names as
appropriate for the CPU or architecture specified by ARCH.
By default, HWR names are selected according to the
architecture and CPU of the binary being disassembled.</p>

<p>&quot;reg-names=ABI&quot; Print GPR and FPR names as
appropriate for the selected ABI.</p>

<p>&quot;reg-names=ARCH&quot; Print CPU-specific register
names (CP0 register and HWR names) as appropriate for the
selected CPU or architecture.</p>

<p>For any of the options listed above, ABI or ARCH may be
specified as numeric to have numbers printed rather than
names, for the selected types of registers. You can list the
available values of ABI and ARCH using the --help
option.</p>

<p>For VAX, you can specify function entry addresses with
-M entry:0xf00ba. You can use this multiple times to
properly disassemble VAX binary files that dont contain
symbol tables (like ROM dumps). In these cases, the function
entry mask would otherwise be decoded as VAX instructions,
which would probably lead the rest of the function being
wrongly disassembled.</p>

<p>-p --private-headers Print information that is specific
to the object file format. The exact information printed
depends upon the object file format. For some object file
formats, no additional information is printed.</p>

<p>-r --reloc Print the relocation entries of the file. If
used with -d or -D, the relocations are printed interspersed
with the disassembly.</p>

<p>-R --dynamic-reloc Print the dynamic relocation entries
of the file. This is only meaningful for dynamic objects,
such as certain types of shared libraries. As for -r, if
used with -d or -D, the relocations are printed interspersed
with the disassembly.</p>

<p>-s --full-contents Display the full contents of any
sections requested. By default all non-empty sections are
displayed.</p>

<p>-S --source Display source code intermixed with
disassembly, if possible. Implies -d.</p>

<p>--prefix=prefix Specify prefix to add to the absolute
paths when used with -S.</p>

<p>--prefix-strip=level Indicate how many initial directory
names to strip off the hardwired absolute paths. It has no
effect without --prefix=prefix.</p>

<p>--show-raw-insn When disassembling instructions, print
the instruction in hex as well as in symbolic form. This is
the default except when --prefix-addresses is used.</p>

<p>--no-show-raw-insn When disassembling instructions, do
not print the instruction bytes. This is the default when
--prefix-addresses is used.</p>

<p>--insn-width=width Display width bytes on a single line
when disassembling instructions.</p>

<p>-W[lLiaprmfFsoR]
--dwarf[=rawline,=decodedline,=info,=abbrev,=pubnames,=aranges,=macro,=frames,=frames-interp,=str,=loc,=Ranges]
Displays the contents of the debug sections in the file, if
any are present. If one of the optional letters or words
follows the switch then only data found in those specific
sections will be dumped.</p>

<p>-G --stabs Display the full contents of any sections
requested. Display the contents of the .stab and .stab.index
and .stab.excl sections from an ELF file. This is only
useful on systems (such as Solaris 2.0) in which
&quot;.stab&quot; debugging symbol-table entries are carried
in an ELF section. In most other file formats, debugging
symbol-table entries are interleaved with linkage symbols,
and are visible in the --syms output.</p>

<p>--start-address=address Start displaying data at the
specified address. This affects the output of the -d, -r and
-s options.</p>

<p>--stop-address=address Stop displaying data at the
specified address. This affects the output of the -d, -r and
-s options.</p>

<p>-t --syms Print the symbol table entries of the file.
This is similar to the information provided by the nm
program, although the display format is different. The
format of the output depends upon the format of the file
being dumped, but there are two main types. One looks like
this:</p>

<p>[ 4](sec 3)(fl 0x00)(ty 0)(scl 3) (nx 1) 0x00000000 .bss
[ 6](sec 1)(fl 0x00)(ty 0)(scl 2) (nx 0) 0x00000000 fred</p>

<p>where the number inside the square brackets is the
number of the entry in the symbol table, the sec number is
the section number, the fl value are the symbols flag bits,
the ty number is the symbol s type, the scl number is the
symbols storage class and the nx value is the number of
auxilary entries associated with the symbol. The last two
fields are the symbols value and its name.</p>

<p>The other common output format, usually seen with ELF
based files, looks like this:</p>

<p>00000000 l d .bss 00000000 .bss 00000000 g .text
00000000 fred</p>

<p>Here the first number is the symbols value (sometimes
refered to as its address). The next field is actually a set
of characters and spaces indicating the flag bits that are
set on the symbol. These characters are described below.
Next is the section with which the symbol is associated or
*ABS* if the section is absolute (ie not connected with any
section), or *UND* if the section is referenced in the file
being dumped, but not defined there.</p>

<p>After the section name comes another field, a number,
which for common symbols is the alignment and for other
symbol is the size. Finally the symbols name is
displayed.</p>

<p>The flag characters are divided into 7 groups as
follows:</p>

<p>&quot;l&quot; &quot;g&quot; &quot;u&quot; &quot;!&quot;
The symbol is a local (l), global (g), unique global (u),
neither global nor local (a space) or both global and local
(!). A symbol can be neither local or global for a variety
of reasons, e.g., because it is used for debugging, but it
is probably an indication of a bug if it is ever both local
and global. Unique global symbols are a GNU extension to the
standard set of ELF symbol bindings. For such a symbol the
dynamic linker will make sure that in the entire process
there is just one symbol with this name and type in use.</p>

<p>&quot;w&quot; The symbol is weak (w) or strong (a
space).</p>

<p>&quot;C&quot; The symbol denotes a constructor (C) or an
ordinary symbol (a space).</p>

<p>&quot;W&quot; The symbol is a warning (W) or a normal
symbol (a space). A warning symbols name is a message to be
displayed if the symbol following the warning symbol is ever
referenced.</p>

<p>&quot;I&quot; &quot;i&quot; The symbol is an indirect
reference to another symbol (I), a function to be evaluated
during reloc processing (i) or a normal symbol (a
space).</p>

<p>&quot;d&quot; &quot;D&quot; The symbol is a debugging
symbol (d) or a dynamic symbol (D) or a normal symbol (a
space).</p>

<p>&quot;F&quot; &quot;f&quot; &quot;O&quot; The symbol is
the name of a function (F) or a file (f) or an object (O) or
just a normal symbol (a space).</p>

<p>-T --dynamic-syms Print the dynamic symbol table entries
of the file. This is only meaningful for dynamic objects,
such as certain types of shared libraries. This is similar
to the information provided by the nm program when given the
-D (--dynamic) option.</p>

<p>--special-syms When displaying symbols include those
which the target considers to be special in some way and
which would not normally be of interest to the user.</p>

<p>-V --version Print the version number of objdump and
exit.</p>

<p>-x --all-headers Display all available header
information, including the symbol table and relocation
entries. Using -x is equivalent to specifying all of -a -f
-h -p -r -t.</p>

<p>-w --wide Format some lines for output devices that have
more than 80 columns. Also do not truncate symbol names when
they are displayed.</p>

<p>-z --disassemble-zeroes Normally the disassembly output
will skip blocks of zeroes. This option directs the
disassembler to disassemble those blocks, just like any
other data.</p>

<p>@file Read command-line options from file. The options
read are inserted in place of the original @file option. If
file does not exist, or cannot be read, then the option will
be treated literally, and not removed.</p>

<p>Options in file are separated by whitespace. A
whitespace character may be included in an option by
surrounding the entire option in either single or double
quotes. Any character (including a backslash) may be
included by prefixing the character to be included with a
backslash. The file may itself contain additional @file
options; any such options will be processed recursively.</p>
