<p>CMP(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual CMP(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME cmp - compare two files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS cmp [ -l | -s ] file1 file2</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The cmp utility shall compare two files. The
cmp utility shall write no output if the files are the same.
Under default options, if they dif- fer, it shall write to
standard output the byte and line number at which the first
difference occurred. Bytes and lines shall be numbered
beginning with 1.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The cmp utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>The following options shall be supported:</p>

<p>-l (Lowercase ell.) Write the byte number (decimal) and
the differ- ing bytes (octal) for each difference.</p>

<p>-s Write nothing for differing files; return exit status
only.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operands shall be supported:</p>

<p>file1 A pathname of the first file to be compared. If
file1 is , the standard input shall be used.</p>

<p>file2 A pathname of the second file to be compared. If
file2 is, the standard input shall be used.</p>

<p>If both file1 and file2 refer to standard input or refer
to the same FIFO special, block special, or character
special file, the results are undefined.</p>

<p>STDIN The standard input shall be used only if the file1
or file2 operand refers to standard input. See the INPUT
FILES section.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES The input files can be any file type.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of cmp:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in
arguments).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error and informative messages written
to standard output.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT In the POSIX locale, results of the comparison
shall be written to standard output. When no options are
used, the format shall be:</p>

<p>&quot;%s %s differ: char %d, line %n&quot;, file1,
file2, &lt;byte number&gt;, &lt;line number&gt;</p>

<p>When the -l option is used, the format shall be:</p>

<p>&quot;%d %o %n&quot;, &lt;byte number&gt;, &lt;differing
byte&gt;, &lt;differing byte&gt;</p>

<p>for each byte that differs. The first &lt;differing
byte&gt; number is from file1 while the second is from
file2. In both cases, &lt;byte number&gt; shall be relative
to the beginning of the file, beginning with 1.</p>

<p>No output shall be written to standard output when the
-s option is used.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages. If file1 and file2 are identical for
the entire length of the shorter file, in the POSIX locale
the following diagnostic message shall be written, unless
the -s option is specified:</p>

<p>&quot;cmp: EOF on %s%n&quot;, &lt;name of shorter
file&gt;, &lt;additional info&gt;</p>

<p>The &lt;additional info&gt; field shall either be null
or a string that starts with a &lt;blank&gt; and contains no
&lt;newline&gt;s. Some implementations report on the number
of lines in this case.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 The files are identical.</p>

<p>1 The files are different; this includes the case where
one file is identical to the first part of the other.</p>

<p>&gt;1 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE Although input files to cmp can be any
type, the results might not be what would be expected on
character special device files or on file types not
described by the System Interfaces volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001. Since this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 does
not specify the block size used when doing input,
comparisons of char- acter special files need not compare
all of the data in those files.</p>

<p>For files which are not text files, line numbers simply
reflect the presence of a &lt;newline&gt;, without any
implication that the file is orga- nized into lines.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The global language in Utility Description
Defaults indicates that using two mutually-exclusive options
together produces unspecified results. Some System V
implementations consider the option usage:</p>

<p>cmp -l -s ...</p>

<p>to be an error. They also treat:</p>

<p>cmp -s -l ...</p>

<p>as if no options were specified. Both of these behaviors
are considered bugs, but are allowed.</p>

<p>The word char in the standard output format comes from
historical usage, even though it is actually a byte number.
When cmp is supported in other locales, implementations are
encouraged to use the word byte or its equivalent in another
language. Users should not interpret this difference to
indicate that the functionality of the utility changed
between locales.</p>

<p>Some implementations report on the number of lines in
the identical- but-shorter file case. This is allowed by the
inclusion of the &lt;addi- tional info&gt; fields in the
output format. The restriction on having a leading
&lt;blank&gt; and no &lt;newline&gt;s is to make parsing for
the filename easier. It is recognized that some filenames
containing white-space characters make parsing difficult
anyway, but the restriction does aid programs used on
systems where the names are predominantly well behaved.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
