<p>NAME makedeltarpm - create a deltarpm from two rpms</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS makedeltarpm [-v] [-V version] [-z compression]
[-s seqfile] [-r] [-u] oldrpm newrpm deltarpm makedeltarpm
[-v] [-V version] [-z compression] [-s seqfile] [-u] -p
oldrpmprint oldpatchrpm oldrpm newrpm deltarpm</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION makedeltarpm creates a deltarpm from two
rpms. The deltarpm can later be used to recreate the new rpm
from either filesystem data or the old rpm. Use the -v
option to make makedeltarpm more verbose about its work (use
it twice to make it even more verbose).</p>

<p>If you want to create a smaller and faster to combine
&quot;rpm-only&quot; deltarpm which does not work with
filesystem data, specify the -r option.</p>

<p>makedeltarpm normally produces a V3 format deltarpm, use
the -V option to specify a different version if desired. The
-z option can be used to specify a different compression
method, the default is to use the same compression method as
used in the new rpm.</p>

<p>The -s option makes makedeltarpm write out the sequence
id to the spec- ified file seqfile.</p>

<p>If you also use patch rpms you should use the -p option
to specify the rpm-print of oldrpm and the created patch
rpm. This option tells makedeltarpm to exclude the files
that were not included in the patch rpm but are not
byteswise identical to the ones in oldrpm.</p>

<p>makedeltarpm can also create an &quot;identity&quot;
deltarpm by adding the -u switch. In this case only one rpm
has to be specified. An identity deltarpm can be useful to
just replace the signature header of a rpm or to reconstruct
a rpm from the filesystem.</p>
