<p>sane-hp3900(5) SANE Scanner Access Now Easy
sane-hp3900(5)</p>

<p>NAME sane-hp3900 - SANE backend for RTS8822 chipset
based scanners</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sane-hp3900 library implements a SANE
(Scanner Access Now Easy) backend that provides access at
least to the following USB flatbed scanners:</p>

<p>Model: Chipset: ------ -------- HP ScanJet 3800
RTS8822BL-03A HP ScanJet 3970 RTS8822L-01H HP ScanJet 4070
Photosmart RTS8822L-01H HP ScanJet 4370 RTS8822L-02A HP
ScanJet G2710 RTS8822BL-03A HP ScanJet G3010 RTS8822L-02A HP
ScanJet G3110 RTS8822L-02A UMAX Astra 4900/4950 RTS8822L-01H
* BenQ 5550 RTS8823L-01E *</p>

<p>More details can be found on the hp3900 backend homepage
http://source- forge.net/projects/hp3900-series/.</p>

<p>This is ALPHA software. Keep your hand at the scanner s
plug and unplug it, if scanner does not start to scan. See
also the BUGS section.</p>

<p>If you own a scanner other than the ones listed above
that works with this backend, please let us know this by
sending the scanners exact model name and the USB vendor and
device ids (e.g. from /proc/bus/usb/devices,
sane-find-scanner or syslog) to us. Even if the scanners
name is only slightly different from the models mentioned
above, please let us know.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION The contents of the hp3900.conf file is a
list of usb lines containing vendor and product ids that
correspond to USB scanners. The file can also contain the
names of device files that correspond to an HP 39XX scanner.
Empty lines and lines starting with a hash mark (#) are
ignored. The scanners are autodetected by usb vendor_id
product_id statements which are already included into
hp3900.conf. &quot;vendor_id&quot; and
&quot;product_id&quot; are hexadecimal numbers that identify
the scanner. If autodetection does not work, add the device
name of your scanner to the configuration file,</p>

<p>FILES /etc/sane.d/hp3900.conf The backend configuration
file (see also description of SANE_CONFIG_DIR below).</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-hp3900.a The static library
implementing this backend.</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-hp3900.so The shared library
implementing this backend (present on systems that support
dynamic loading).</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT SANE_CONFIG_DIR This environment variable
specifies the list of directories that may contain the
configuration file. Under UNIX, the directories are
separated by a colon (:), under OS/2, they are separated by
a semi-colon (;). If this variable is not set, the config-
uration file is searched in two default directories: first,
the current working directory (&quot;.&quot;) and then in
/etc/sane.d. If the value of the environment variable ends
with the directory sepa- rator character, then the default
directories are searched after the explicitly specified
directories. For example, setting SANE_CONFIG_DIR to
&quot;/tmp/config:&quot; would result in directories
&quot;tmp/config&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and
&quot;/etc/sane.d&quot; being searched (in this order).</p>

<p>SANE_DEBUG_HP3900 If the library was compiled with debug
support enabled, this environment variable controls the
debug level for this backend. Higher debug levels increase
the verbosity of the output.</p>

<p>Example: export SANE_DEBUG_HP3900=4</p>

<p>BUGS Scanning is only tested with Linux/ix86/gcc. Be
careful when testing on other operating systems and
especially on big-endian platforms. The scanner may get
wrong data.</p>
