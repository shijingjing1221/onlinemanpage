<p>MAGIC(5) BSD File Formats Manual MAGIC(5)</p>

<p>NAME magic - file commands magic pattern file</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page documents the format of the
magic file as used by the file(1) command, version 5.04. The
file(1) command identifies the type of a file using, among
other tests, a test for whether the file contains certain
magic patterns . The file /usr/share/misc/magic specifies
what patterns are to be tested for, what message or MIME
type to print if a particular pattern is found, and
additional information to extract from the file.</p>

<p>Each line of the file specifies a test to be performed.
A test compares the data starting at a particular offset in
the file with a byte value, a string or a numeric value. If
the test succeeds, a message is printed. The line consists
of the following fields:</p>

<p>offset A number specifying the offset, in bytes, into
the file of the data which is to be tested.</p>

<p>type The type of the data to be tested. The possible
values are:</p>

<p>byte A one-byte value.</p>

<p>short A two-byte value in this machines native byte
order.</p>

<p>long A four-byte value in this machine s native byte
order.</p>

<p>quad An eight-byte value in this machines native byte
order.</p>

<p>float A 32-bit single precision IEEE floating point
number in this machines native byte order.</p>

<p>double A 64-bit double precision IEEE floating point
number in this machines native byte order.</p>

<p>string A string of bytes. The string type specification
can be optionally followed by /[Bbc]*. The B flag compacts
whitespace in the target, which must con- tain at least one
whitespace character. If the magic has n consecutive blanks,
the target needs at least n consecutive blanks to match. The
b flag treats every blank in the target as an optional
blank. Finally the c flag, specifies case insen- sitive
matching: lowercase characters in the magic match both lower
and upper case characters in the target, whereas upper case
characters in the magic only match uppercase characters in
the target.</p>

<p>pstring A Pascal-style string where the first byte is
inter- preted as the an unsigned length. The string is not
NUL terminated.</p>

<p>date A four-byte value interpreted as a UNIX date.</p>

<p>qdate A eight-byte value interpreted as a UNIX date.</p>

<p>ldate A four-byte value interpreted as a UNIX-style
date, but interpreted as local time rather than UTC.</p>

<p>qldate An eight-byte value interpreted as a UNIX-style
date, but interpreted as local time rather than UTC.</p>

<p>beid3 A 32-bit ID3 length in big-endian byte order.</p>

<p>beshort A two-byte value in big-endian byte order.</p>

<p>belong A four-byte value in big-endian byte order.</p>

<p>bequad An eight-byte value in big-endian byte order.</p>

<p>befloat A 32-bit single precision IEEE floating point
number in big-endian byte order.</p>

<p>bedouble A 64-bit double precision IEEE floating point
number in big-endian byte order.</p>

<p>bedate A four-byte value in big-endian byte order,
inter- preted as a Unix date.</p>

<p>beqdate An eight-byte value in big-endian byte order,
inter- preted as a Unix date.</p>

<p>beldate A four-byte value in big-endian byte order,
inter- preted as a UNIX-style date, but interpreted as local
time rather than UTC.</p>

<p>beqldate An eight-byte value in big-endian byte order,
inter- preted as a UNIX-style date, but interpreted as local
time rather than UTC.</p>

<p>bestring16 A two-byte unicode (UCS16) string in
big-endian byte order.</p>

<p>leid3 A 32-bit ID3 length in little-endian byte
order.</p>

<p>leshort A two-byte value in little-endian byte
order.</p>

<p>lelong A four-byte value in little-endian byte
order.</p>

<p>lequad An eight-byte value in little-endian byte
order.</p>

<p>lefloat A 32-bit single precision IEEE floating point
number in little-endian byte order.</p>

<p>ledouble A 64-bit double precision IEEE floating point
number in little-endian byte order.</p>

<p>ledate A four-byte value in little-endian byte order,
interpreted as a UNIX date.</p>

<p>leqdate An eight-byte value in little-endian byte order,
interpreted as a UNIX date.</p>

<p>leldate A four-byte value in little-endian byte order,
interpreted as a UNIX-style date, but interpreted as local
time rather than UTC.</p>

<p>leqldate An eight-byte value in little-endian byte
order, interpreted as a UNIX-style date, but interpreted as
local time rather than UTC.</p>

<p>lestring16 A two-byte unicode (UCS16) string in
little-endian byte order.</p>

<p>melong A four-byte value in middle-endian (PDP-11) byte
order.</p>

<p>medate A four-byte value in middle-endian (PDP-11) byte
order, interpreted as a UNIX date.</p>

<p>meldate A four-byte value in middle-endian (PDP-11) byte
order, interpreted as a UNIX-style date, but inter- preted
as local time rather than UTC.</p>

<p>indirect Starting at the given offset, consult the magic
database again.</p>

<p>regex A regular expression match in extended POSIX
regular expression syntax (like egrep). Regular expressions
can take exponential time to process, and their per-
formance is hard to predict, so their use is dis- couraged.
When used in production environments, their performance
should be carefully checked. The type specification can be
optionally followed by /[c][s]. The c flag makes the match
case insensi- tive, while the s flag update the offset to
the start offset of the match, rather than the end. The
regular expression is tested against line N + 1 onwards,
where N is the given offset. Line endings are assumed to be
in the machines native format. ^ and $ match the beginning
and end of individual lines, respectively, not beginning and
end of file.</p>

<p>search A literal string search starting at the given
off- set. The same modifier flags can be used as for string
patterns. The modifier flags (if any) must be followed by
/number the range, that is, the number of positions at which
the match will be attempted, starting from the start offset.
This is suitable for searching larger binary expressions
with variable offsets, using escapes for special characters.
The offset works as for regex.</p>

<p>default This is intended to be used with the test x
(which is always true) and a message that is to be used if
there are no other matches.</p>

<p>Each top-level magic pattern (see below for an
explanation of levels) is classified as text or binary
according to the types used. Types regex and search are
classified as text tests, unless non-printable characters
are used in the pattern. All other tests are classified as
binary. A top-level pattern is considered to be a test text
when all its patterns are text pat- terns; otherwise, it is
considered to be a binary pattern. When matching a file,
binary patterns are tried first; if no match is found, and
the file looks like text, then its encoding is deter- mined
and the text patterns are tried.</p>

<p>The numeric types may optionally be followed by &amp;
and a numeric value, to specify that the value is to be AND
ed with the numeric value before any comparisons are done.
Prepending a u to the type indicates that ordered
comparisons should be unsigned.</p>

<p>test The value to be compared with the value from the
file. If the type is numeric, this value is specified in C
form; if it is a string, it is specified as a C string with
the usual escapes permitted (e.g. for new-line).</p>

<p>Numeric values may be preceded by a character indicating
the operation to be performed. It may be =, to specify that
the value from the file must equal the specified value,
&lt;, to spec- ify that the value from the file must be less
than the specified value, &gt;, to specify that the value
from the file must be greater than the specified value,
&amp;, to specify that the value from the file must have set
all of the bits that are set in the specified value, ^, to
specify that the value from the file must have clear any of
the bits that are set in the specified value, or ~, the
value specified after is negated before tested. x, to
specify that any value will match. If the character is
omitted, it is assumed to be =. Operators &amp;, ^, and ~
dont work with floats and doubles. The operator ! specifies
that the line matches if the test does not succeed.</p>

<p>Numeric values are specified in C form; e.g. 13 is
decimal, 013 is octal, and 0x13 is hexadecimal.</p>

<p>For string values, the string from the file must match
the spec- ified string. The operators =, &lt; and &gt; (but
not &amp;) can be applied to strings. The length used for
matching is that of the string argument in the magic file.
This means that a line can match any non-empty string
(usually used to then print the string), with &gt;0 (because
all non-empty strings are greater than the empty
string).</p>

<p>The special test x always evaluates to true. message The
mes- sage to be printed if the comparison succeeds. If the
string contains a printf(3) format specification, the value
from the file (with any specified masking performed) is
printed using the message as the format string. If the
string begins with , the message printed is the remainder of
the string with no whitespace added before it: multiple
matches are normally sepa- rated by a single space.</p>

<p>An APPLE 4+4 character APPLE creator and type can be
specified as:</p>

<p>!:apple CREATYPE</p>

<p>A MIME type is given on a separate line, which must be
the next non-blank or comment line after the magic line that
identifies the file type, and has the following format:</p>

<p>!:mime MIMETYPE</p>

<p>i.e. the literal string !:mime followed by the MIME
type.</p>

<p>An optional strength can be supplied on a separate line
which refers to the current magic description using the
following format:</p>

<p>!:strength OP VALUE</p>

<p>The operand OP can be: +, -, *, or / and VALUE is a
constant between 0 and 255. This constant is applied using
the specified operand to the currently computed default
magic strength.</p>

<p>Some file formats contain additional information which
is to be printed along with the file type or need additional
tests to determine the true file type. These additional
tests are introduced by one or more &gt; char- acters
preceding the offset. The number of &gt; on the line
indicates the level of the test; a line with no &gt; at the
beginning is considered to be at level 0. Tests are arranged
in a tree-like hierarchy: If a the test on a line at level n
succeeds, all following tests at level n+1 are per- formed,
and the messages printed if the tests succeed, untile a line
with level n (or less) appears. For more complex files, one
can use empty messages to get just the &quot;if/then&quot;
effect, in the following way:</p>

<p>0 string MZ &gt;0x18 leshort &lt;0x40 MS-DOS executable
&gt;0x18 leshort &gt;0x3f extended PC executable (e.g., MS
Windows)</p>

<p>Offsets do not need to be constant, but can also be read
from the file being examined. If the first character
following the last &gt; is a ( then the string after the
parenthesis is interpreted as an indirect offset. That means
that the number after the parenthesis is used as an offset
in the file. The value at that offset is read, and is used
again as an off- set in the file. Indirect offsets are of
the form: (( x [.[bislBISL]][+-][ y ]). The value of x is
used as an offset in the file. A byte, id3 length, short or
long is read at that offset depending on the [bislBISLm]
type specifier. The capitalized types interpret the number
as a big endian value, whereas the small letter versions
interpret the number as a little endian value; the m type
interprets the number as a middle endian (PDP-11) value. To
that number the value of y is added and the result is used
as an offset in the file. The default type if one is not
specified is long.</p>

<p>That way variable length structures can be examined:</p>

<p># MS Windows executables are also valid MS-DOS
executables 0 string MZ &gt;0x18 leshort &lt;0x40 MZ
executable (MS-DOS) # skip the whole block below if it is
not an extended executable &gt;0x18 leshort &gt;0x3f
&gt;&gt;(0x3c.l) string PE PE executable (MS-Windows)
&gt;&gt;(0x3c.l) string LX LX executable (OS/2)</p>

<p>This strategy of examining has a drawback: You must make
sure that you eventually print something, or users may get
empty output (like, when there is neither PE nor LE in the
above example)</p>

<p>If this indirect offset cannot be used directly, simple
calculations are possible: appending [+-*/%&amp;|^]number
inside parentheses allows one to modify the value read from
the file before it is used as an offset:</p>

<p># MS Windows executables are also valid MS-DOS
executables 0 string MZ # sometimes, the value at 0x18 is
less that 0x40 but theres still an # extended executable,
simply appended to the file &gt;0x18 leshort &lt;0x40
&gt;&gt;(4.s*512) leshort 0x014c COFF executable (MS-DOS,
DJGPP) &gt;&gt;(4.s*512) leshort !0x014c MZ executable
(MS-DOS)</p>

<p>Sometimes you do not know the exact offset as this
depends on the length or position (when indirection was used
before) of preceding fields. You can specify an offset
relative to the end of the last up-level field using &amp;
as a prefix to the offset:</p>

<p>0 string MZ &gt;0x18 leshort &gt;0x3f &gt;&gt;(0x3c.l)
string PE PE executable (MS-Windows) # immediately following
the PE signature is the CPU type &gt;&gt;&gt;&amp;0 leshort
0x14c for Intel 80386 &gt;&gt;&gt;&amp;0 leshort 0x184 for
DEC Alpha</p>

<p>Indirect and relative offsets can be combined:</p>

<p>0 string MZ &gt;0x18 leshort &lt;0x40 &gt;&gt;(4.s*512)
leshort !0x014c MZ executable (MS-DOS) # if it s not COFF,
go back 512 bytes and add the offset taken # from byte 2/3,
which is yet another way of finding the start # of the
extended executable &gt;&gt;&gt;&amp;(2.s-514) string LE LE
executable (MS Windows VxD driver)</p>

<p>Or the other way around:</p>

<p>0 string MZ &gt;0x18 leshort &gt;0x3f &gt;&gt;(0x3c.l)
string LE LE executable (MS-Windows) # at offset 0x80 (-4,
since relative offsets start at the end # of the up-level
match) inside the LE header, we find the absolute # offset
to the code area, where we look for a specific signature U P
X c o m &gt;&gt;&gt;(&amp;0x7c.l+0x26) string UPX p r e s s
e d</p>

<p>Or even both!</p>

<p>0 string MZ &gt;0x18 leshort &gt;0x3f &gt;&gt;(0x3c.l)
string LE LE executable (MS-Windows) # at offset 0x58 inside
the LE header, we find the relative offset # to a data area
where we look for a specific signature A C E s e l f - e x t
r &gt;&gt;&gt;&amp;(&amp;0x54.l-3) string UNACE a c t i n g
a r c h i v e</p>

<p>Finally, if you have to deal with offset/length pairs in
your file, even the second value in a parenthesized
expression can be taken from the file itself, using another
set of parentheses. Note that this additional indirect
offset is always relative to the start of the main indirect
off- set.</p>

<p>0 string MZ &gt;0x18 leshort &gt;0x3f &gt;&gt;(0x3c.l)
string PE PE executable (MS-Windows) # search for the PE
section called &quot;.idata&quot;... &gt;&gt;&gt;&amp;0xf4
search/0x140 .idata # ...and go to the end of it, calculated
from start+length; # these are located 14 and 10 bytes after
the section name Z I P s e l f - e x t r
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;(&amp;0xe.l+(-4)) string PK34 a c t i n g a
r c h i v e</p>

<p>SEE ALSO file(1) - the command that reads this file.</p>

<p>BUGS The formats long, belong, lelong, melong, short,
beshort, leshort, date, bedate, medate, ledate, beldate,
leldate, and meldate are system-depen- dent; perhaps they
should be specified as a number of bytes (2B, 4B, etc),
since the files being recognized typically come from a
system on which the lengths are invariant.</p>
