<p>NAME perlrebackslash - Perl Regular Expression Backslash
Sequences and Escapes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The top level documentation about Perl
regular expressions is found in perlre.</p>

<p>This document describes all backslash and escape
sequences. After explaining the role of the backslash, it
lists all the sequences that have a special meaning in Perl
regular expressions (in alphabetical order), then describes
each of them.</p>

<p>Most sequences are described in detail in different
documents; the primary purpose of this document is to have a
quick reference guide describing all backslash and escape
sequences.</p>

<p>The backslash In a regular expression, the backslash can
perform one of two tasks: it either takes away the special
meaning of the character following it (for instance,
&quot;&quot; matches a vertical bar, its not an
alternation), or it is the start of a backslash or escape
sequence.</p>

<p>The rules determining what it is are quite simple: if
the character following the backslash is a punctuation
(non-word) character (that is, anything that is not a
letter, digit or underscore), then the backslash just takes
away the special meaning (if any) of the character following
it.</p>

<p>If the character following the backslash is a letter or
a digit, then the sequence may be special; if so, its listed
below. A few letters have not been used yet, and escaping
them with a backslash is safe for now, but a future version
of Perl may assign a special meaning to it. However, if you
have warnings turned on, Perl will issue a warning if you
use such a sequence. [1].</p>

<p>It is however guaranteed that backslash or escape
sequences never have a punctuation character following the
backslash, not now, and not in a future version of Perl 5.
So it is safe to put a backslash in front of a non-word
character.</p>

<p>Note that the backslash itself is special; if you want
to match a backslash, you have to escape the backslash with
a backslash: &quot;/\/&quot; matches a single backslash.</p>

<p>[1] There is one exception. If you use an alphanumerical
character as the delimiter of your pattern (which you
probably shouldnt do for readability reasons), you will have
to escape the delimiter if you want to match it. Perl wont
warn then. See also &quot;Gory details of parsing quoted
constructs&quot; in perlop.</p>

<p>Character Escapes Fixed characters</p>

<p>A handful of characters have a dedicated character
escape. The following table shows them, along with their
code points (in decimal and hex), their ASCII name, the
control escape (see below) and a short description.</p>

<p>Seq. Code Point ASCII Cntr Description. Dec Hex 7 07 BEL

y .</p>

<p>[2] &quot;0 matches a logical newline. Perl will convert
between &quot;0 and your OSses native newline character when
reading from or writing to text files.</p>

<p>Example</p>

<p>$str =~ //; # Matches if $str contains a (horizontal)
tab.</p>

<p>Control characters</p>

<p>&quot; &quot; matches the character control-M (a
carriage return, code point 13). The case of the character
following &quot; match the same character.</p>

<p>Mnemonic: control character.</p>

<p>Example</p>

<p>$str =~ / Named characters</p>

<p>All Unicode characters have a Unicode name, and
characters in various scripts have names as well. It is even
possible to give your own names to characters. You can use a
character by name by using the &quot;&quot; construct; the
name of the character goes between the curly braces. You do
have to &quot;use charnames&quot; to load the names of the
characters, otherwise Perl will complain you use a name it
doesnt know about. For more details, see charnames.</p>

<p>Mnemonic: Named character.</p>

<p>Example</p>

<p>use charnames &rsquo;:full&rsquo;; # Loads the Unicode
names. $str =~ /HAI CHARACTER SO SO}/; # Matches the Thai SO
SO character</p>

<p>use charnames &rsquo;Cyrillic&rsquo;; # Loads Cyrillic
names. $str =~ /HE}A}/; # Match &quot;ZHE&quot; followed by
&quot;KA&quot;.</p>

<p>Octal escapes</p>

<p>Octal escapes consist of a backslash followed by two or
three octal digits matching the code point of the character
you want to use. This allows for 512 characters (&quot;
0&quot; up to &quot;777&quot;) that can be expressed this
way. Enough in pre-Unicode days, but most Unicode characters
cannot be escaped this way.</p>

<p>Note that a character that is expressed as an octal
escape is considered as a character without special meaning
by the regex engine, and will match &quot;as is&quot;.</p>

<p>Examples</p>

<p>$str = &quot;Perl&quot;; $str =~ /120/; # Match,
&quot;120&quot; is &quot;P&quot;. $str =~ /120+/; # Match,
&quot;120&quot; is &quot;P&quot;, it is repeated at least
once. $str =~ /P 53/; # No match, &quot; 53&quot; is
&quot;+&quot; and taken literally.</p>

<p>Caveat</p>

<p>Octal escapes potentially clash with backreferences.
They both consist of a backslash followed by numbers. So
Perl has to use heuristics to determine whether it is a
backreference or an octal escape. Perl uses the following
rules:</p>

<p>1. If the backslash is followed by a single digit, its a
backreference.</p>

<p>2. If the first digit following the backslash is a 0,
its an octal escape.</p>

<p>3. If the number following the backslash is N (decimal),
and Perl already has seen N capture groups, Perl will
consider this to be a backreference. Otherwise, it will
consider it to be an octal escape. Note that if N &gt; 999,
Perl only takes the first three digits for the octal escape;
the rest is matched as is.</p>

<p>my $pat = &quot;(&quot; x 999; $pat .= &quot;a&quot;;
$pat .= &quot;)&quot; x 999; /^($pat)1000$/; # Matches
&rsquo;aa&rsquo;; there are 1000 capture groups.
/^$pat1000$/; # Matches &rsquo;a@0&rsquo;; there are 999
capture groups # and 1000 is seen as 100 (a &rsquo;@&rsquo;)
and a &rsquo;0&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Hexadecimal escapes</p>

<p>Hexadecimal escapes start with &quot;nd are then either
followed by two digit hexadecimal number, or a hexadecimal
number of arbitrary length surrounded by curly braces. The
hexadecimal number is the code point of the character you
want to express.</p>

<p>Note that a character that is expressed as a hexadecimal
escape is considered as a character without special meaning
by the regex engine, and will match &quot;as is&quot;.</p>

<p>Mnemonic: hexadecimal.</p>

<p>Examples</p>

<p>$str = &quot;Perl&quot;; $str =~ /0/; # Match,
&quot;0&quot; is &quot;P&quot;. $str =~ /0+/; # Match,
&quot;0&quot; is &quot;P&quot;, it is repeated at least
once. $str =~ /PB/; # No match, &quot;B&quot; is
&quot;+&quot; and taken literally.</p>

<p>// # Snowman with an umbrella. # The Unicode character
2603 is a snowman, # the Unicode character 2602 is an
umbrella. /}/ # Black smiling face. /}/ # Same, the hex
digits A - F are case insensitive.</p>

<p>Modifiers A number of backslash sequences have to do
with changing the character, or characters following them.
&quot;ill lowercase the character following it, while
&quot;&quot; will uppercase (or, more accurately, titlecase)
the character following it. (They perform similar
functionality as the functions &quot;lcfirst&quot; and
&quot;ucfirst&quot;).</p>

<p>To uppercase or lowercase several characters, one might
want to use &quot;r &quot;U&quot;, which will
lowercase/uppercase all characters following them, until
either the end of the pattern, or the next occurrence of
&quot; functions &quot;lc&quot; and &quot;uc&quot; do.</p>

<p>&quot;Q&quot; is used to escape all characters
following, up to the next &quot; the end of the pattern.
&quot;Q&quot; adds a backslash to any character that isn t a
letter, digit or underscore. This will ensure that any
character between &quot;Q&quot; and &quot; interpreted by
the regexp engine.</p>

<p>Mnemonic: Lowercase, Uppercase, Quotemeta, End.</p>

<p>Examples</p>

<p>$sid = &quot;sid&quot;; $greg = &quot;GrEg&quot;;
$miranda = &quot;(Miranda)&quot;; $str =~ /$sid/; # Matches
&rsquo;Sid&rsquo; $str =~ /reg/; # Matches
&rsquo;greg&rsquo; $str =~ /Q$miranda; # Matches
&rsquo;(Miranda)&rsquo;, as if the pattern # had been
written as /randa/</p>

<p>Character classes Perl regular expressions have a large
range of character classes. Some of the character classes
are written as a backslash sequence. We will briefly discuss
those here; full details of character classes can be found
in perlrecharclass.</p>

<p>&quot;1512 digits, underscore). &quot;&quot; is a
character class that matches any digit, while the character
class &quot;atches any white space character. New in perl
5.10.0 are the classes &quot;nd &quot;hich match horizontal
and vertical white space characters.</p>

<p>The uppercase variants (&quot;W&quot;, &quot; &quot; and
&quot;) are character classes that match any character that
isn t a word character, digit, white space, horizontal white
space or vertical white space.</p>

<p>Mnemonics: word, digit, space, horizontal, vertical.</p>

<p>Unicode classes</p>

<p>&quot;P&quot; (where &quot;P&quot; is a single letter)
and &quot;{Property}&quot; are used to match a character
that matches the given Unicode property; properties include
things like &quot;letter&quot;, or &quot;thai
character&quot;. Capitalizing the sequence to &quot;PP&quot;
and &quot;P{Property}&quot; make the sequence match a
character that doesn t match the given Unicode property. For
more details, see &quot;Backslashed sequences&quot; in
perlrecharclass and &quot;Unicode Character Properties&quot;
in perlunicode.</p>

<p>Mnemonic: property.</p>

<p>Referencing If capturing parenthesis are used in a
regular expression, we can refer to the part of the source
string that was matched, and match exactly the same thing.
There are three ways of referring to such backreference:
absolutely, relatively, and by name.</p>

<p>Absolute referencing</p>

<p>A backslash sequence that starts with a backslash and is
followed by a number is an absolute reference (but be aware
of the caveat mentioned above). If the number is N, it
refers to the Nth set of parenthesis - whatever has been
matched by that set of parenthesis has to be matched by the
&quot;s well.</p>

<p>Examples</p>

<p>/(1272 /(.)(.)21/; # Match a four letter palindrome
(e.g. &quot;ABBA&quot;).</p>

<p>Relative referencing</p>

<p>New in perl 5.10.0 is a different way of referring to
capture buffers: &quot;0. &quot;0 takes a number as
argument, with the number in curly braces (the braces are
optional). If the number (N) does not have a sign, its a
reference to the Nth capture group (so &quot;02}&quot; is
equivalent to &quot;2&quot; - except that &quot;0 always
refers to a capture group and will never be seen as an octal
escape). If the number is negative, the reference is
relative, referring to the Nth group before the
&quot;0-N}&quot;.</p>

<p>The big advantage of &quot;0-N}&quot; is that it makes
it much easier to write patterns with references that can be
interpolated in larger patterns, even if the larger pattern
also contains capture groups.</p>

<p>Mnemonic: group.</p>

<p>Examples</p>

<p>/(A) # Buffer 1 ( # Buffer 2 (B) # Buffer 3 0-1} #
Refers to buffer 3 (B) 0-3} # Refers to buffer 1 (A) ) /x; #
Matches &quot;ABBA&quot;.</p>

<p>my $qr = qr /(.)(.)0-2}0-1}/; # Matches
&rsquo;abab&rsquo;, &rsquo;cdcd&rsquo;, etc. /$qr$qr/ #
Matches &rsquo;ababcdcd&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Named referencing</p>

<p>Also new in perl 5.10.0 is the use of named capture
buffers, which can be referred to by name. This is done with
&quot;0name}&quot;, which is a backreference to the capture
buffer with the name name.</p>

<p>To be compatible with .Net regular expressions,
&quot;0name}&quot; may also be written as &quot;name}&quot;,
&quot;name&gt;&quot; or &quot;name&rsquo;&quot;.</p>

<p>Note that &quot;0}&quot; has the potential to be
ambiguous, as it could be a named reference, or an absolute
or relative reference (if its argument is numeric). However,
names are not allowed to start with digits, nor are allowed
to contain a hyphen, so there is no ambiguity.</p>

<p>Examples</p>

<p>/(?&lt;word&gt;1224 /(?&lt;word&gt;384
/(?&lt;word&gt;384
/(?&lt;letter1&gt;.)(?&lt;letter2&gt;.)0letter2}0letter1}/ #
Match a four letter palindrome (e.g. &quot;ABBA&quot;)</p>

<p>Assertions Assertions are conditions that have to be
true -- they don t actually match parts of the substring.
There are six assertions that are written as backslash
sequences.</p>

<p>0&quot;0/m&quot; modifier isnt used, then
&quot;/0^/&quot;. However, if the &quot;/m&quot; modifier is
used, then &quot;/^/&quot; matches internal newlines, but
the meaning of &quot;/0m&quot; modifier. &quot;0 matches at
the beginning of the string regardless whether the
&quot;/m&quot; modifier is used.</p>

<p>, &quot;&quot;andused,&quot; matchmodifieisnt
thenat&quot;/&quot;theisendequivalentthatof theis,
string.itwith $/&quot;, If th/m&quot; matches at the end of
the string, or before the newline at the end of the string.
If the &quot;/m&quot; modifier is used, then &quot;/$/&quot;
matches at internal newlines, but the meaning of
&quot;/&quot; isnt changed by the &quot;/m&quot; modifier.
&quot; matches at the enda oftrailingthe stringnewline)(or
jusbefore regardless whether the &quot;/m&quot; modifier is
used.</p>

<p>&quot;&quot; is just like &quot;, except that it
willnewline.not match&quot;&quot;willbefore trailing only
match at the end of the string - regardless of the modifiers
used, and not before a newline.</p>

<p>G &quot;G&quot; is usually only used in combination with
the &quot;/g&quot; modifier. If the &quot;/g&quot; modifier
is used (and the match is done in scalar context), Perl will
remember where in the source string the last match ended,
and the next time, it will start the match from where it
ended the previous time.</p>

<p>&quot;G&quot; matches the point where the previous match
ended, or the beginning of the string if there was no
previous match.</p>

<p>Mnemonic: Global.</p>

<p>0 &quot; d o e &quot;0s n t a match. &quot;n0 beginning
and after the end of d w i the source string; so &quot;l
lmatch at the beginning (or end) of the source string if the
source string begins (or ends) with a word character.
Otherwise, &quot;0 match.</p>

<p>Mnemonic: boundary.</p>

<p>Examples</p>

<p>&quot;cat&quot; =~ /0h. &quot;cat&quot; =~ /cat; #
Match&quot;cat0 =~ /cat; # Match&quot;cat0 =~ /cat; # No
match.</p>

<p>a &quot;cat&quot; =~ /ta &quot;cats&quot; =~ /t a t 0 ;
# &quot;cat&quot; =~ /Nh. o m a t a t 0 ; &quot;cats&quot;
=~ /#h. M a t</p>

<p>while (&quot;cat dog&quot; =~ /(144 print $1; # Prints
&rsquo;catdog&rsquo; } while (&quot;cat dog&quot; =~ /G(144
print $1; # Prints &rsquo;cat&rsquo; }</p>

<p>Misc Here we document the backslash sequences that dont
fall in one of the categories above. They are:</p>

<p>&quot;always matches a single octet, even if the source
string is encoded in UTF-8 format, and the character to be
matched is a multi-octet character. &quot;was introduced in
perl 5.6.</p>

<p>Mnemonic: oCtet.</p>

<p>K This is new in perl 5.10.0. Anything that is matched
left of &quot;K&quot; is not included in $&amp; - and will
not be replaced if the pattern is used in a substitution.
This will allow you to write &quot;s/PAT1 K
PAT2/REPL/x&quot; instead of &quot;s/(PAT1)
PAT2/${1}REPL/x&quot; or &quot;s/(?&lt;=PAT1)
PAT2/REPL/x&quot;.</p>

<p>Mnemonic: Keep.</p>

<p>&quot; generic newline, that is, anything that is
considered a newline by Unicode. This includes all
characters matched by &quot;rtical white space), and the
multi character sequence &quot;DA&quot; (carriage return
followed by a line feed, aka the network newline, or the
newline used in Windows text files). &quot;quivalent with
&quot;(?&gt;DA)|&quot;. Since &quot;atch a more than one
character, it cannot be put inside a bracketed character
class; &quot;/[s an error. &quot;ntroduced in perl
5.10.0.</p>

<p>Mnemonic: none really. &quot;icked because PCRE already
uses &quot;nd more importantly because Unicode recommends
such a regular expression metacharacter, and suggests
&quot;he notation.</p>

<p>matches an extended Unicode _ combining character
sequence, and is equivalent to &quot;(?&gt;PMM*)&quot;.
&quot;PM&quot; matches any character that is not considered
a Unicode mark character, while &quot;M&quot; matches any
character that is considered a Unicode mark character; so
&quot; matches any non mark character followed by zero or
more mark characters. Mark characters include (but are not
restricted to) combining characters and vowel signs.</p>

<p>&quot; would consider a single character: for example a
base character (the &quot;PM&quot; above), for example a
letter, followed by zero or more diacritics, which are
combining characters (the &quot;M*&quot; above).</p>

<p>Mnemonic: eXtended Unicode character.</p>

<p>Examples</p>

<p>&quot;&quot; =~ /^ # Match as chr (256) takes 2 octets
in UTF-8.</p>

<p>$str =~ s/fooKbar/baz/g; # Change any &rsquo;bar&rsquo;
following a &rsquo;foo&rsquo; to &rsquo;baz&rsquo;. $str =~
s/(.)K1//g; # Delete duplicated characters.</p>

<p>&quot;0 =~ /^ Match, is a generic newline. is a generic
newline. &quot; =~ /^ Match, &quot; is a generic newline. 0
=~ /^ Match, &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;P&quot; =~ /^</p>
