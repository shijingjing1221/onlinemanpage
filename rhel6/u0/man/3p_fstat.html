<p>FSTAT(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual FSTAT(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME fstat - get file status</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;</p>

<p>int fstat(int fildes, struct stat *buf);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The fstat() function shall obtain
information about an open file asso- ciated with the file
descriptor fildes, and shall write it to the area pointed to
by buf.</p>

<p>If fildes references a shared memory object, the
implementation shall update in the stat structure pointed to
by the buf argument only the st_uid, st_gid, st_size, and
st_mode fields, and only the S_IRUSR, S_IWUSR, S_IRGRP,
S_IWGRP, S_IROTH, and S_IWOTH file permission bits need be
valid. The implementation may update other fields and
flags.</p>

<p>If fildes references a typed memory object, the
implementation shall update in the stat structure pointed to
by the buf argument only the st_uid, st_gid, st_size, and
st_mode fields, and only the S_IRUSR, S_IWUSR, S_IRGRP,
S_IWGRP, S_IROTH, and S_IWOTH file permission bits need be
valid. The implementation may update other fields and
flags.</p>

<p>The buf argument is a pointer to a stat structure, as
defined in &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;, into which information is
placed concerning the file.</p>

<p>The structure members st_mode, st_ino, st_dev, st_uid,
st_gid, st_atime, st_ctime, and st_mtime shall have
meaningful values for all other file types defined in this
volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001. The value of the member
st_nlink shall be set to the number of links to the
file.</p>

<p>An implementation that provides additional or
alternative file access control mechanisms may, under
implementation-defined conditions, cause fstat() to
fail.</p>

<p>The fstat() function shall update any time-related
fields as described in the Base Definitions volume of IEEE
Std 1003.1-2001, Section 4.7, File Times Update, before
writing into the stat structure.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, 0 shall be
returned. Otherwise, -1 shall be returned and errno set to
indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The fstat() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EBADF The fildes argument is not a valid file
descriptor.</p>

<p>EIO An I/O error occurred while reading from the file
system.</p>

<p>EOVERFLOW The file size in bytes or the number of blocks
allocated to the file or the file serial number cannot be
represented correctly in the structure pointed to by
buf.</p>

<p>The fstat() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EOVERFLOW One of the values is too large to store into
the structure pointed to by the buf argument.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Obtaining File Status Information The following
example shows how to obtain file status information for a
file named /home/cnd/mod1. The structure variable buffer is
defined for the stat structure. The /home/cnd/mod1 file is
opened with read/write privileges and is passed to the open
file descriptor fildes.</p>

<p>#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; #include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;
#include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;</p>

<p>struct stat buffer; int status; ... fildes =
open(&quot;/home/cnd/mod1&quot;, O_RDWR); status =
fstat(fildes, &amp;buffer);</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
