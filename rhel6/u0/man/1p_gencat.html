<p>GENCAT(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual GENCAT(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME gencat - generate a formatted message catalog</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS gencat catfile msgfile...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The gencat utility shall merge the message
text source file msgfile into a formatted message catalog
catfile. The file catfile shall be created if it does not
already exist. If catfile does exist, its mes- sages shall
be included in the new catfile. If set and message numbers
collide, the new message text defined in msgfile shall
replace the old message text currently contained in
catfile.</p>

<p>OPTIONS None.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operands shall be supported:</p>

<p>catfile A pathname of the formatted message catalog. If-
is speci- fied, standard output shall be used. The format of
the message catalog produced is unspecified.</p>

<p>msgfile A pathname of a message text source file. If- is
specified for an instance of msgfile, standard input shall
be used. The format of message text source files is defined
in the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section.</p>

<p>STDIN The standard input shall not be used unless a
msgfile operand is speci- fied as-.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES The input files shall be text files.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of gen- cat:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments
and input files).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT The standard output shall not be used unless the
catfile operand is specified as-.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION The content of a message text file
shall be in the format defined as follows. Note that the
fields of a message text source line are sepa- rated by a
single &lt;blank&gt;. Any other &lt;blank&gt;s are
considered to be part of the subsequent field.</p>

<p>$set n comment</p>

<p>This line specifies the set identifier of the following
messages until the next $set or end-of-file appears. The n
denotes the set identifier, which is defined as a number in
the range [1, {NL_SETMAX}] (see the &lt;limits.h&gt; header
defined in the Base Def- initions volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001). The application shall ensure that set
identifiers are presented in ascending order within a single
source file, but need not be contiguous. Any string
following the set identifier shall be treated as a com-
ment. If no $set directive is specified in a message text
source file, all messages shall be located in an
implementation-defined default message set NL_SETD (see the
&lt;nl_types.h&gt; header defined in the Base Definitions
volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001).</p>

<p>$delset n comment</p>

<p>This line deletes message set n from an existing message
cata- log. The n denotes the set number [1, {NL_SETMAX}].
Any string following the set number shall be treated as a
comment.</p>

<p>$ comment A line beginning with$followed by a
&lt;blank&gt; shall be treated as a comment.</p>

<p>m message-text</p>

<p>The m denotes the message identifier, which is defined
as a num- ber in the range [1, {NL_MSGMAX}] (see the
&lt;limits.h&gt; header). The message-text shall be stored
in the message catalog with the set identifier specified by
the last $set directive, and with message identifier m. If
the message-text is empty, and a &lt;blank&gt; field
separator is present, an empty string shall be stored in the
message catalog. If a message source line has a message
number, but neither a field separator nor message-text, the
existing message with that number (if any) shall be deleted
from the catalog. The application shall ensure that message
identifiers are in ascending order within a single set, but
need not be contiguous. The application shall ensure that
the length of message-text is in the range [0, {NL_TEXTMAX}]
(see the &lt;lim- its.h&gt; header).</p>

<p>$quote n This line specifies an optional quote character
c, which can be used to surround message-text so that
trailing spaces or null (empty) messages are visible in a
message source line. By default, or if an empty $quote
directive is supplied, no quoting of message-text shall be
recognized.</p>

<p>Empty lines in a message text source file shall be
ignored. The effects of lines starting with any character
other than those defined above are
implementation-defined.</p>

<p>Text strings can contain the special characters and
escape sequences defined in the following table:</p>

<p>Description Symbol Sequence &lt;newline&gt; NL(LF)
Horizontal-tab HT &lt;vertical-tab&gt; VT &lt; c a r r i a g
e &lt;backspace&gt; BS - r e t u r n &gt; C R
&lt;form-feed&gt; FF Backslash \ Bit pattern ddd dd</p>

<p>The escape sequence ddd&quot; consists of backslash
followed by one, two, or three octal digits, which shall be
taken to specify the value of the desired character. If the
character following a backslash is not one of those
specified, the backslash shall be ignored.</p>

<p>Backslash ( ) followed by a &lt;newline&gt; is also used
to continue a string on the following line. Thus, the
following two lines describe a single message string:</p>

<p>1 This line continues to the next line</p>

<p>which shall be equivalent to:</p>

<p>1 This line continues to the next line</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 Successful completion.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE Message catalogs produced by gencat
are binary encoded, meaning that their portability cannot be
guaranteed between different types of machine. Thus, just as
C programs need to be recompiled for each type of machine,
so message catalogs must be recreated via gencat.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
