<p>ATTR_REMOVE(3) XFS Compatibility API ATTR_REMOVE(3)</p>

<p>NAME attr_remove, attr_removef - remove a user attribute
of a filesystem object</p>

<p>C SYNOPSIS #include &lt;attr/attributes.h&gt;</p>

<p>int attr_remove (const char *path, const char *attrname,
int flags);</p>

<p>int attr_removef (int fd, const char *attrname, int
flags);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The attr_remove and attr_removef functions
provide a way to remove pre- viously created attributes from
filesystem objects.</p>

<p>Path points to a path name for a filesystem object, and
fd refers to the file descriptor associated with a file. If
the attribute attrname exists, the attribute name and value
will be removed from the fileystem object. The flags
argument can contain the following symbols bitwise
OR&acute;ed together:</p>

<p>ATTR_ROOT Look for attrname in the root address space,
not in the user address space. (limited to use by super-user
only)</p>

<p>ATTR_DONTFOLLOW Do not follow symbolic links when
resolving a path on an attr_remove function call. The
default is to follow symbolic links.</p>

<p>attr_remove will fail if one or more of the following
are true:</p>

<p>[ENOATTR] The attribute name given is not associated
with the indicated filesystem object.</p>

<p>[ENOENT] The named file does not exist.</p>

<p>[EPERM] The effective user ID does not match the owner
of the file and the effective user ID is not super-user.</p>

<p>[ENOTDIR] A component of the path prefix is not a
directory.</p>

<p>[EACCES] Search permission is denied on a component of
the path prefix.</p>

<p>[EINVAL] A bit was set in the flag argument that is not
defined for this system call.</p>

<p>[EFAULT] Path points outside the allocated address space
of the process.</p>

<p>[ELOOP] A path name lookup involved too many symbolic
links.</p>

<p>[ENAMETOOLONG] The length of path exceeds {MAXPATHLEN},
or a pathname component is longer than {MAXNAMELEN}.</p>

<p>attr_removef will fail if:</p>

<p>[ENOATTR] The attribute name given is not associated
with the indicated filesystem object.</p>

<p>[EINVAL] A bit was set in the flag argument that is not
defined for this system call, or fd refers to a socket, not
a file.</p>

<p>[EFAULT] Attrname points outside the allocated address
space of the process.</p>

<p>[EBADF] Fd does not refer to a valid descriptor.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS On success, zero is returned. On error, -1
is returned, and errno is set appropriately.</p>

attr_multi(3), and attr_set(3).</p>
