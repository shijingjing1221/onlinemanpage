<p>NAME pgmtolispm - convert a PGM image to Lisp Machine
format</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pgmtolispm</p>

<p>[pgmfile]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pgmtolispm reads a PGM image as input and produces a
Lisp Machine bitmap as output.</p>

<p>This is the file format read by the
tv:read-bit-array-file function on TI Explorer and Symbolics
lisp machines.</p>

<p>Given a PGM (instead of a PBM), pgmtolispm outputs a
multi-plane image. This is probably not useful unless you
have a color lisp machine.</p>

<p>Multi-plane bitmaps on lisp machines are color; but the
lispm image file format does not include a color map, so we
must treat it as a graymap instead. This is unfortunate.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO lispmtopgm(1), pgm(1)</p>

<p>LIMITATIONS Output width is always rounded up to the
nearest multiple of 32; this might not always be what you
want, but it probably is (arrays which are not modulo 32
cannot be passed to the Lispm BITBLT function, and thus
cannot easily be displayed on the screen).</p>

<p>No color.</p>
