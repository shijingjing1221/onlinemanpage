<p>NAME certmonger.conf - configuration file for
certmonger</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The certmonger.conf file contains default
settings used by certmonger. Its format is more or less that
of a typical INI-style file. The only sections currently of
note are named defaults and selfsign.</p>

<p>DEFAULTS Within the defaults section, these variables
and values are recognized:</p>

<p>ttls This is the list of times, before a certificate s
not-after validity date (often referred to as its expiration
time) when certmonger should warn that the certificate will
soon no longer be valid. If certmonger is configured to
automatically renew the certificate, it will also attempt to
do so at these times. The default list of values is
&quot;2419200, 604800, 259200, 172800, 86400&quot;.</p>

<p>notification_method This is the method by which
certmonger will notify the system administrator that a
certificate will soon become invalid. The recognized values
are syslog and mail. The default is syslog.</p>

<p>notification_destination This is the destination to
which certmonger will send notifica- tions. It can be a
syslog priority and/or facility, separated by a period, or
it can be an email address. The default value is
daemon.notice.</p>

<p>symmetric_cipher This is the symmetric cipher which will
be used to encrypt pri- vate keys stored in OpenSSL s PEM
format. Recognized values include aes128 and aes256. The
default is aes128. It is not recommended that this value be
changed except in cases where the default is incompatible
with other software.</p>

<p>digest This is the digest algorithm which will be used
when signing certificate signing requests and self-signed
certificates. Rec- ognized values include sha1, sha256,
sha384, and sha512. The default is sha256. It is not
recommended that this value be changed except in cases where
the default is incompatible with other software.</p>

<p>SELFSIGN Within the selfsign section, these variables
and values are recognized:</p>

<p>validity_period This is the validity period given to
self-signed certificates. The value is specified as a
combination of years (y), months (M), weeks (w), days (d),
hours (h), minutes (m), and/or seconds (s). If no unit of
time is specified, seconds are assumed. The default value is
1y.</p>
