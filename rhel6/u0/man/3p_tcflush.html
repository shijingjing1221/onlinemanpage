<p>TCFLUSH(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual TCFLUSH(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME tcflush - flush non-transmitted output data,
non-read input data, or both</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;termios.h&gt;</p>

<p>int tcflush(int fildes, int queue_selector);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Upon successful completion, tcflush() shall
discard data written to the object referred to by fildes (an
open file descriptor associated with a terminal) but not
transmitted, or data received but not read, depending on the
value of queue_selector:</p>

<p>* If queue_selector is TCIFLUSH, it shall flush data
received but not read.</p>

<p>* If queue_selector is TCOFLUSH, it shall flush data
written but not transmitted.</p>

<p>* If queue_selector is TCIOFLUSH, it shall flush both
data received but not read and data written but not
transmitted.</p>

<p>Attempts to use tcflush() from a process which is a
member of a back- ground process group on a fildes
associated with its controlling termi- nal shall cause the
process group to be sent a SIGTTOU signal. If the calling
process is blocking or ignoring SIGTTOU signals, the process
shall be allowed to perform the operation, and no signal is
sent.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, 0 shall be
returned. Otherwise, -1 shall be returned and errno set to
indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The tcflush() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EBADF The fildes argument is not a valid file
descriptor.</p>

<p>EINVAL The queue_selector argument is not a supported
value.</p>

<p>ENOTTY The file associated with fildes is not a
terminal.</p>

<p>The tcflush() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EIO The process group of the writing process is
orphaned, and the writing process is not ignoring or
blocking SIGTTOU.</p>
