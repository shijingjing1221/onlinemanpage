<p>NAME ecryptfsd - user-space eCryptfs daemon.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION ecryptfsd is a userspace daemon that runs as
the user performing file operations under the eCryptfs mount
point. It services public key requests from the eCryptfs
kernel module; these requests are sent via netlink on file
open events. ecryptfsd only needs to be run when a mount is
done with a public key module.</p>

<p>The daemon can be started simply by running ecryptfsd.
ecryptfsd will register itself with the kernel as the daemon
that should service all eCryptfs filesystem requests done
under the context of the user who runs the daemon.</p>
