<p>NAME uil The user interface language compiler</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS uil [options ] [file]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The uil command invokes the UIL compiler.
The User Interface Language (UIL) is a specification
language for describing the initial state of a user
interface for a Motif application. The specification
describes the objects (menus, dialog boxes, labels, push
buttons, and so on) used in the interface and specifies the
routines to be called when the inter- face changes state as
a result of user interaction.</p>

<p>file Specifies the file to be compiled through the UIL
compiler.</p>

<p>options Specifies one or more of the following
options:</p>

<p>-Ipathname This option causes the compiler to look for
include files in the directory specified if the include
files have not been found in the paths that already were
searched. Specify this option followed by a pathname, with
no intervening spaces.</p>

<p>-m Machine code is listed. This directs the compiler to
place in the listing file a description of the records that
it added to the User Interface Database (UID). This helps
you isolate errors. The default is no machine code.</p>

<p>-o file</p>

<p>Directs the compiler to produce a UID. By default, UIL
creates a UID with the name a.uid. The file specifies the
filename for the UID. No UID is pro- duced if the compiler
issues any diagnostics cate- gorized as error or severe.
UIDs are portable only across same-size machine
architectures.</p>

<p>-s Directs the compiler to set the locale before com-
piling any files. The locale is set in an imple-
mentation-dependent manner. On ANSI C-based sys- tems, the
locale is usually set by calling setlo- cale(LC_ALL,
&quot;&quot;). If this option is not specified, the compiler
does not set the locale.</p>

<p>-v file Directs the compiler to generate a listing. The
file specifies the filename for the listing. If the -v
option is not present, no listing is gener- ated by the
compiler. The default is no listing.</p>

<p>-w Specifies that the compiler suppress all warning and
informational messages. If this option is not present, all
messages are generated, regardless of the severity.</p>

<p>-wmd file Specifies a binary widget meta-language
description file to be used in place of the default WML
description.</p>
