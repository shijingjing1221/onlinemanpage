<p>NAME mlocate.db - a mlocate database</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION A mlocate database starts with a file
header: 8 bytes for a magic num- ber (0mlocate&quot; like a
C literal), 4 bytes for the configuration block size in big
endian, 1 byte for file format version (0), 1 byte for the
require visibility flag (0 or 1), 2 bytes padding, and a
NUL-termi- nated path name of the root of the database.</p>

<p>The header is followed by a configuration block,
included to ensure databases are not reused if some
configuration changes could affect their contents. The size
of the configuration block in bytes is stored in the file
header. The configuration block is a sequence of variable
assignments, ordered by variable name. Each variable
assignment con- sists of a NUL-terminated variable name and
an ordered list of NUL-ter- minated values. The value list
is terminated by one more NUL charac- ter. The ordering used
is defined by the strcmp () function.</p>

<p>Currently defined variables are:</p>

<p>prune_bind_mounts A single entry, the value of
PRUNE_BIND_MOUNTS; one of the strings 0 or 1.</p>

<p>prunefs The value of PRUNEFS, each entry is converted to
uppercase.</p>

<p>prunepaths The value of PRUNEPATHS.</p>

<p>The rest of the file until EOF describes directories and
their con- tents. Each directory starts with a header: 8
bytes for directory time (seconds) in big endian, 4 bytes
for directory time (nanoseconds) in big endian (0 if
unknown, less than 1,000,000,000), 4 bytes padding, and a
NUL-terminated path name of the the directory. Directory
con- tents, a sequence of file entries sorted by name,
follow.</p>

<p>Directory time is the maximum of st_ctime and st_mtime
of the direc- tory. updatedb(8) uses the original data if
the directory time in the database and in the file system
match exactly. Directory time equal to 0 always causes
rescanning of the directory: this is necessary to han- dle
directories which were being updated while building the
database.</p>

<p>Each file entry starts with a single byte, marking its
type:</p>

<p>0 A non-directory file. Followed by a NUL-terminated
file (not path) name.</p>

<p>1 A subdirectory. Followed by a NUL-terminated file (not
path) name.</p>

<p>2 Marks the end of the current directory.</p>

<p>locate(1) only reports file entries, directory names are
not reported because they are reported as an entry in their
parent directory. The only exception is the root directory
of the database, which is stored in the file header.</p>
