<p>NOHUP(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual NOHUP(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME nohup - invoke a utility immune to hangups</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS nohup utility [argument...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The nohup utility shall invoke the utility
named by the utility operand with arguments supplied as the
argument operands. At the time the named utility is invoked,
the SIGHUP signal shall be set to be ignored.</p>

<p>If the standard output is a terminal, all output written
by the named utility to its standard output shall be
appended to the end of the file nohup.out in the current
directory. If nohup.out cannot be created or opened for
appending, the output shall be appended to the end of the
file nohup.out in the directory specified by the HOME
environment vari- able. If neither file can be created or
opened for appending, utility shall not be invoked. If a
file is created, the file s permission bits shall be set to
S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR.</p>

<p>If the standard error is a terminal, all output written
by the named utility to its standard error shall be
redirected to the same file descriptor as the standard
output.</p>

<p>OPTIONS None.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operands shall be supported:</p>

<p>utility The name of a utility that is to be invoked. If
the utility operand names any of the special built-in
utilities in Special Built-In Utilities, the results are
undefined.</p>

<p>argument Any string to be supplied as an argument when
invoking the util- ity named by the utility operand.</p>

<p>STDIN Not used.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of nohup:</p>

<p>HOME Determine the pathname of the users home directory:
if the out- put file nohup.out cannot be created in the
current directory, the nohup utility shall use the directory
named by HOME to cre- ate the file.</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in
arguments).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>PATH Determine the search path that is used to locate
the utility to be invoked. See the Base Definitions volume
of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Chapter 8, Environment
Variables.</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS The nohup utility shall take the
standard action for all signals except that SIGHUP shall be
ignored.</p>

<p>STDOUT If the standard output is not a terminal, the
standard output of nohup shall be the standard output
generated by the execution of the utility specified by the
operands. Otherwise, nothing shall be written to the
standard output.</p>

<p>STDERR If the standard output is a terminal, a message
shall be written to the standard error, indicating the name
of the file to which the output is being appended. The name
of the file shall be either nohup.out or
$HOME/nohup.out.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES If the standard output is a terminal, all
output written by the named utility to the standard output
and standard error is appended to the file nohup.out, which
is created if it does not already exist.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>126 The utility specified by utility was found but could
not be invoked.</p>

<p>127 An error occurred in the nohup utility or the
utility specified by utility could not be found.</p>

<p>Otherwise, the exit status of nohup shall be that of the
utility speci- fied by the utility operand.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The command, env, nice, nohup, time,
and xargs utilities have been specified to use exit code 127
if an error occurs so that applications can distinguish
&quot;failure to find a utility&quot; from &quot;invoked
utility exited with an error indication&quot;. The value 127
was chosen because it is not commonly used for other
meanings; most utilities use small val- ues for &quot;normal
error conditions&quot; and the values above 128 can be con-
fused with termination due to receipt of a signal. The value
126 was chosen in a similar manner to indicate that the
utility could be found, but not invoked. Some scripts
produce meaningful error messages differ- entiating the 126
and 127 cases. The distinction between exit codes 126 and
127 is based on KornShell practice that uses 127 when all
attempts to exec the utility fail with [ENOENT], and uses
126 when any attempt to exec the utility fails for any other
reason.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES It is frequently desirable to apply nohup to
pipelines or lists of com- mands. This can be done by
placing pipelines and command lists in a single file; this
file can then be invoked as a utility, and the nohup applies
to everything in the file.</p>

<p>Alternatively, the following command can be used to
apply nohup to a complex command:</p>

<p>nohup sh -ccomplex-command-line</p>

<p>RATIONALE The 4.3 BSD version ignores SIGTERM and
SIGHUP, and if ./nohup.out can- not be used, it fails
instead of trying to use $HOME/nohup.out.</p>

<p>The csh utility has a built-in version of nohup that
acts differently from the nohup defined in this volume of
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001.</p>

<p>The term utility is used, rather than command, to
highlight the fact that shell compound commands, pipelines,
special built-ins, and so on, cannot be used directly.
However, utility includes user application programs and
shell scripts, not just the standard utilities.</p>

<p>Historical versions of the nohup utility use default
file creation semantics. Some more recent versions use the
permissions specified here as an added security
precaution.</p>

<p>Some historical implementations ignore SIGQUIT in
addition to SIGHUP; others ignore SIGTERM. An early proposal
allowed, but did not require, SIGQUIT to be ignored. Several
reviewers objected that nohup should only modify the
handling of SIGHUP as required by this volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
