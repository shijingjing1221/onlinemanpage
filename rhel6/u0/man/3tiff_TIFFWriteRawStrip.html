<p>tsize_t TIFFWriteRawStrip(TIFF *tif, tstrip_t strip,
tdata_t buf, tsize_t size)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Append size bytes of raw data to the
specified strip.</p>

<p>NOTES The strip number must be valid according to the
current settings of the ImageLength and RowsPerStrip tags.
An image may be dynamically grown by increasing the value of
ImageLength prior to each call to TIFFWrit- eRawStrip.</p>

Otherwise, the value of size is returned.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS All error messages are directed to the
TIFFError(3TIFF) routine.</p>

<p>%s: File not open for writing. The file was opened for
reading, not writing.</p>

<p>Can not write scanlines to a tiled image. The image is
assumed to be organized in tiles because the TileWidth and
TileLength tags have been set with TIFFSetField(3TIFF).</p>

<p>%s: Must set &quot;ImageWidth&quot; before writing data.
The images width has not be set before the first write. See
TIFFSetField(3TIFF) for infor- mation on how to do this.</p>

<p>%s: Must set &quot;PlanarConfiguration&quot; before
writing data. The organiza- tion of data has not be defined
before the first write. See TIFFSet- Field(3TIFF) for
information on how to do this.</p>

<p>%s: No space for strip arrays&quot;. There was not
enough space for the arrays that hold strip offsets and byte
counts.</p>

<p>%s: Strip %d out of range, max %d. The specified strip
is not a valid strip according to the currently specified
image dimensions.</p>
