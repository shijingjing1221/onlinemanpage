<p>PAM_LIMITS(8) Linux-PAM Manual PAM_LIMITS(8)</p>

<p>NAME pam_limits - PAM module to limit resources</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pam_limits.so [change_uid]
[conf=/path/to/limits.conf] [debug] [utmp_early]
[noaudit]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pam_limits PAM module sets limits on the
system resources that can be obtained in a user-session.
Users of uid=0 are affected by this limits, too.</p>

<p>By default limits are taken from the
/etc/security/limits.conf config file. Then individual
*.conf files from the /etc/security/limits.d/ directory are
read. The files are parsed one after another in the order of
&quot;C&quot; locale. The effect of the individual files is
the same as if all the files were concatenated together in
the order of parsing. If a config file is explicitly
specified with a module option then the files in the above
directory are not parsed.</p>

<p>The module must not be called by a multithreaded
application.</p>

<p>If Linux PAM is compiled with audit support the module
will report when it denies access based on limit of maximum
number of concurrent login sessions.</p>

<p>OPTIONS change_uid Change real uid to the user for who
the limits are set up. Use this option if you have problems
like login not forking a shell for user who has no
processes. Be warned that something else may break when you
do this.</p>

<p>conf=/path/to/limits.conf Indicate an alternative
limits.conf style configuration file to override the
default.</p>

<p>debug Print debug information.</p>

<p>utmp_early Some broken applications actually allocate a
utmp entry for the user before the user is admitted to the
system. If some of the services you are configuring PAM for
do this, you can selectively use this module argument to
compensate for this behavior and at the same time maintain
system-wide consistency with a single limits.conf file.</p>

<p>noaudit Do not report exceeded maximum logins count to
the audit subsystem.</p>

<p>MODULE TYPES PROVIDED Only the session module type is
provided.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUES PAM_ABORT Cannot get current limits.</p>

<p>PAM_IGNORE No limits found for this user.</p>

<p>PAM_PERM_DENIED New limits could not be set.</p>

<p>PAM_SERVICE_ERR Cannot read config file.</p>

<p>PAM_SESSION_ERR Error recovering account name.</p>

<p>PAM_SUCCESS Limits were changed.</p>

<p>PAM_USER_UNKNOWN The user is not known to the
system.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/security/limits.conf Default configuration
file</p>

<p>EXAMPLES For the services you need resources limits
(login for example) put a the following line in
/etc/pam.d/login as the last line for that service (usually
after the pam_unix session line):</p>

<p>#%PAM-1.0 # # Resource limits imposed on login sessions
via pam_limits # session required pam_limits.so</p>

<p>Replace &quot;login&quot; for each service you are using
this module.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO limits.conf(5), pam.d(5), pam(8).</p>
