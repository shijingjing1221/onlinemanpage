<p>NAME replcon - SELinux file context replacement tool</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS replcon NEW_CONTEXT DIR [OPTIONS]
[EXPRESSION]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION replcon allows the user to find and replace
file contexts. Replace- ments can be filtered by object
class as described below.</p>

<p>REQUIRED ARGUMENTS NEW_CONTEXT The replacement context
as expressed as a partial context, described below.</p>

<p>DIR Initial directory to begin searching. The tool will
recurse into any subdirectories, so be sure there are no
circular mounts within it.</p>

<p>EXPRESSION The following options allow the user to
specify which files to find. A file must meet all specified
criteria for its context to be replaced. If no expression is
provided, all files contexts are replaced.</p>

<p>-t TYPE, --type=TYPE Search for files with a context
containing the type TYPE.</p>

<p>-u USER, --user=USER Search for files with a context
containing the user USER.</p>

<p>-r ROLE, --role=ROLE Search for files with a context
containing the role ROLE.</p>

<p>-m RANGE, --mls-range=RANGE Search for files with a
context with the MLS range of RANGE. Note that replcon
ignores the SELinux translation library, if present. In
addition, this flag is ignored if DIR has no MLS
information.</p>

<p>--context=CONTEXT Search for files matching this partial
context. This flag over- rides -t, -u, -r, and -m.</p>

<p>-p PATH, --path=PATH Search for files which include
PATH.</p>

<p>-c CLASS, --class=CLASS Search only files of object
class CLASS.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -v, --verbose Display context info during
replacement.</p>

<p>-h, --help Print help information and exit.</p>

<p>-V, --version Print version information and exit.</p>

<p>PARTIAL CONTEXT The --context flag and NEW_CONTEXT
argument specify a partial context, which is a a colon
separated list of user, role, and type. If the system
supports MLS, the context may have a fourth field that gives
the range. With --context if a field is not specified or is
the literal asterisk, then the query will always match the
field. With NEW_CONTEXT if a field is not specified or is
the literal asterisk, then that por- tion of the context
will not be modified.</p>

<p>OBJECT CLASSES Valid object class strings are</p>

<p>block, char, dir, fifo, file, link, or sock.</p>

<p>NOTE The replcon utility always operates on
&quot;raw&quot; SELinux file contexts. If the system has an
installed translation library (i.e., libsetrans), those
translations are ignored in favor of reading the original
con- texts from the filesystem.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES replcon ::type_t: . Replace every context s
type in the current directory with type_t. The user and role
portion remain unchanged.</p>

<p>replcon -u user_u *:role_r:* . Replace every contexts
role with user user_u in the current directory with role_r.
The user and type portion remain unchanged.</p>

<p>replcon --context ::type_t:s0 :::s0:c0 /tmp Replace
every context with type type_t and MLS range s0 in /tmp with
MLS range s0:c0.</p>
