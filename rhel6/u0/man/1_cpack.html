<p>NAME cpack - Packaging driver provided by CMake.</p>

<p>USAGE cpack -G &lt;generator&gt; [options]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The &quot;cpack&quot; executable is the
CMake packaging program. CMake-generated build trees created
for projects that use the INSTALL_* commands have packaging
support. This program will generate the package.</p>

<p>CMake is a cross-platform build system generator.
Projects specify their build process with
platform-independent CMake listfiles included in each
directory of a source tree with the name CMakeLists.txt.
Users build a project by using CMake to generate a build
system for a native tool on their platform.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -G &lt;generator&gt; Use the specified generator
to generate package.</p>

<p>CPack may support multiple native packaging systems on
certain platforms. A generator is responsible for generating
input files for particular system and invoking that systems.
Possible gener- ator names are specified in the Generators
section.</p>

<p>-C &lt;Configuration&gt; Specify the project
configuration</p>

<p>This option specifies the configuration that the project
was build with, for example Debug, Release.</p>

<p>-D &lt;var&gt;=&lt;value&gt; Set a CPack variable.</p>

<p>Set a variable that can be used by the generator.</p>

<p>--config &lt;config file&gt; Specify the config
file.</p>

<p>Specify the config file to use to create the package. By
default CPackConfig.cmake in the current directory will be
used.</p>

<p>GENERATORS DEB Debian packages</p>

<p>NSIS Null Soft Installer</p>

<p>RPM RPM packages</p>

<p>STGZ Self extracting Tar GZip compression</p>

<p>TBZ2 Tar BZip2 compression</p>

<p>TGZ Tar GZip compression</p>

<p>TZ Tar Compress compression</p>

<p>ZIP ZIP file format</p>

<p>PROPERTIES CMake Properties - Properties supported by
CMake, the Cross-Platform Makefile Generator.</p>

<p>This is the documentation for the properties supported
by CMake. Prop- erties can have different scopes. They can
either be assigned to a source file, a directory, a target
or globally to CMake. By modifying the values of properties
the behaviour of the build system can be cus- tomized.</p>

<p>COMPATIBILITY COMMANDS CMake Compatibility Listfile
Commands - Obsolete commands supported by CMake for
compatibility.</p>

<p>This is the documentation for now obsolete listfile
commands from pre- vious CMake versions, which are still
supported for compatibility rea- sons. You should instead
use the newer, faster and shinier new com- mands. ;-)</p>
