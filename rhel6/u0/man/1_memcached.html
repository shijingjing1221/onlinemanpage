<p>NAME memcached - high-performance memory object caching
system</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS memcached [options]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page documents briefly the
memcached memory object caching daemon.</p>

<p>memcached is a flexible memory object caching daemon
designed to alle- viate database load in dynamic web
applications by storing objects in memory. It s based on
libevent to scale to any size needed, and is specifically
optimized to avoid swapping and always use non-blocking
I/O.</p>

<p>OPTIONS These programs follow the usual GNU command line
syntax. A summary of options is included below.</p>

<p>-s &lt;file&gt; Unix socket path to listen on (disables
network support).</p>

<p>-a &lt;perms&gt; Permissions (in octal format) for Unix
socket created with -s option.</p>

<p>-l &lt;ip_addr&gt; Listen on &lt;ip_addr&gt;; default to
INADDR_ANY. This is an important option to consider as there
is no other way to secure the installation. Binding to an
internal or firewalled network interface is suggested.</p>

<p>-d Run memcached as a daemon.</p>

<p>-u &lt;username&gt; Assume the identity of
&lt;username&gt; (only when run as root).</p>

<p>-m &lt;num&gt; Use &lt;num&gt; MB memory max to use for
object storage; the default is 64 megabytes.</p>

<p>-c &lt;num&gt; Use &lt;num&gt; max simultaneous
connections; the default is 1024.</p>

<p>-R &lt;num&gt; This option seeks to prevent client
starvation by setting a limit to the number of sequential
requests the server will pro- cess from an individual client
connection. Once a connection has exceeded this value, the
server will attempt to process I/O on other connections
before handling any further request from this connection.
The default value for this option is 20.</p>

<p>-k Lock down all paged memory. This is a somewhat
dangerous option with large caches, so consult the README
and memcached homepage for configuration suggestions.</p>

<p>-p &lt;num&gt; Listen on TCP port &lt;num&gt;, the
default is port 11211.</p>

<p>-U &lt;num&gt; Listen on UDP port &lt;num&gt;, the
default is port 11211, 0 is off.</p>

<p>-M Disable automatic removal of items from the cache
when out of memory. Additions will not be possible until
adequate space is freed up.</p>

<p>-r Raise the core file size limit to the maximum
allowable.</p>

<p>-f &lt;factor&gt; Use &lt;factor&gt; as the multiplier
for computing the sizes of memory chunks that items are
stored in. A lower value may result in less wasted memory
depending on the total amount of memory available and the
distribution of item sizes. The default is 1.25.</p>

<p>-n &lt;size&gt; Allocate a minimum of &lt;size&gt; bytes
for the item key, value, and flags. The default is 48. If
you have a lot of small keys and values, you can get a
significant memory efficiency gain with a lower value. If
you use a high chunk growth factor (-f option), on the other
hand, you may want to increase the size to allow a bigger
percentage of your items to fit in the most densely packed
(smallest) chunks.</p>

<p>-C Disable the use of CAS (and reduce the per-item size
by 8 bytes).</p>

<p>-h Show the version of memcached and a summary of
options.</p>

<p>-v Be verbose during the event loop; print out errors
and warnings.</p>

<p>-vv Be even more verbose; same as -v but also print
client commands and responses.</p>

<p>-i Print memcached and libevent licenses.</p>

<p>-P &lt;filename&gt; Print pidfile to &lt;filename&gt;,
only used under -d option.</p>

<p>-t &lt;threads&gt; Number of threads to use to process
incoming requests. This option is only meaningful if
memcached was compiled with thread support enabled. It is
typically not useful to set this higher than the number of
CPU cores on the memcached server. The default is 4.</p>

<p>-D &lt;char&gt; Use &lt;char&gt; as the delimiter
between key prefixes and IDs. This is used for per-prefix
stats reporting. The default is &quot;:&quot; (colon). If
this option is specified, stats collection is turned on
automatically; if not, then it may be turned on by sending
the &quot;stats detail on&quot; command to the server.</p>

<p>-L Try to use large memory pages (if available).
Increasing the memory page size could reduce the number of
TLB misses and improve the performance. In order to get
large pages from the OS, memcached will allocate the total
item-cache in one large chunk. Only available if supported
on your OS.</p>

<p>-B &lt;proto&gt; Specify the binding protocol to use. By
default, the server will autonegotiate client connections.
By using this option, you can specify the protocol clients
must speak. Possible options are &quot;auto&quot; (the
default, autonegotiation behavior), &quot;ascii&quot; and
&quot;binary&quot;.</p>

<p>-I &lt;size&gt; Override the default size of each slab
page. Default is 1mb. Default is 1m, minimum is 1k, max is
128m. Adjusting this value changes the item size limit.
Beware that this also increases the number of slabs (use -v
to view), and the overal memory usage of memcached.</p>
