<p>XChangeWindowAttributes(3) XLIB FUNCTIONS
XChangeWindowAttributes(3)</p>

<p>NAME XChangeWindowAttributes, XSetWindowBackground,
XSetWindowBackground- Pixmap, XSetWindowBorder,
XSetWindowBorderPixmap, XSetWindowColormap - change window
attributes</p>

<p>SYNTAX int XChangeWindowAttributes(Display *display,
Window w, unsigned long valuemask, XSetWindowAttributes
*attributes);</p>

<p>int XSetWindowBackground(Display *display, Window w,
unsigned long background_pixel);</p>

<p>int XSetWindowBackgroundPixmap(Display *display, Window
w, Pixmap back- ground_pixmap);</p>

<p>int XSetWindowBorder(Display *display, Window w,
unsigned long bor- der_pixel);</p>

<p>int XSetWindowBorderPixmap(Display *display, Window w,
Pixmap bor- der_pixmap);</p>

<p>int XSetWindowColormap(Display *display, Window w,
Colormap colormap);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS attributes Specifies the structure from which
the values (as specified by the value mask) are to be taken.
The value mask should have the appropriate bits set to
indicate which attributes have been set in the
structure.</p>

<p>background_pixel Specifies the pixel that is to be used
for the background.</p>

<p>background_pixmap Specifies the background pixmap,
ParentRelative, or None.</p>

<p>border_pixel Specifies the entry in the colormap.</p>

<p>border_pixmap Specifies the border pixmap or
CopyFromParent.</p>

<p>display Specifies the connection to the X server.</p>

<p>valuemask Specifies which window attributes are defined
in the attributes argument. This mask is the bitwise
inclusive OR of the valid attribute mask bits. If valuemask
is zero, the attributes are ignored and are not
referenced.</p>

<p>w Specifies the window.</p>

<p>colormap Specifies the colormap.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Depending on the valuemask, the
XChangeWindowAttributes function uses the window attributes
in the XSetWindowAttributes structure to change the
specified window attributes. Changing the background does
not cause the window contents to be changed. To repaint the
window and its background, use XClearWindow. Setting the
border or changing the back- ground such that the border
tile origin changes causes the border to be repainted.
Changing the background of a root window to None or Paren-
tRelative restores the default background pixmap. Changing
the border of a root window to CopyFromParent restores the
default border pixmap. Changing the win-gravity does not
affect the current position of the window. Changing the
backing-store of an obscured window to WhenMapped or Always,
or changing the backing-planes, backing-pixel, or save-under
of a mapped window may have no immediate effect. Changing
the colormap of a window (that is, defining a new map, not
changing the contents of the existing map) generates a
ColormapNotify event. Changing the col- ormap of a visible
window may have no immediate effect on the screen because
the map may not be installed (see XInstallColormap).
Changing the cursor of a root window to None restores the
default cursor. When- ever possible, you are encouraged to
share colormaps.</p>

<p>Multiple clients can select input on the same window.
Their event masks are maintained separately. When an event
is generated, it is reported to all interested clients.
However, only one client at a time can select for
SubstructureRedirectMask, ResizeRedirectMask, and But-
tonPressMask. If a client attempts to select any of these
event masks and some other client has already selected one,
a BadAccess error results. There is only one
do-not-propagate-mask for a window, not one per client.</p>

<p>XChangeWindowAttributes can generate BadAccess,
BadColor, BadCursor, BadMatch, BadPixmap, BadValue, and
BadWindow errors.</p>

<p>The XSetWindowBackground function sets the background of
the window to the specified pixel value. Changing the
background does not cause the window contents to be changed.
XSetWindowBackground uses a pixmap of undefined size filled
with the pixel value you passed. If you try to change the
background of an InputOnly window, a BadMatch error
results.</p>

<p>XSetWindowBackground can generate BadMatch and BadWindow
errors.</p>

<p>The XSetWindowBackgroundPixmap function sets the
background pixmap of the window to the specified pixmap. The
background pixmap can immedi- ately be freed if no further
explicit references to it are to be made. If ParentRelative
is specified, the background pixmap of the windows parent is
used, or on the root window, the default background is
restored. If you try to change the background of an
InputOnly window, a BadMatch error results. If the
background is set to None, the window has no defined
background.</p>

<p>XSetWindowBackgroundPixmap can generate BadMatch,
BadPixmap, and Bad- Window errors.</p>

<p>The XSetWindowBorder function sets the border of the
window to the pixel value you specify. If you attempt to
perform this on an Inpu- tOnly window, a BadMatch error
results.</p>

<p>XSetWindowBorder can generate BadMatch and BadWindow
errors.</p>

<p>The XSetWindowBorderPixmap function sets the border
pixmap of the win- dow to the pixmap you specify. The border
pixmap can be freed immedi- ately if no further explicit
references to it are to be made. If you specify
CopyFromParent, a copy of the parent window s border pixmap
is used. If you attempt to perform this on an InputOnly
window, a Bad- Match error results.</p>

<p>XSetWindowBorderPixmap can generate BadMatch, BadPixmap,
and BadWindow errors.</p>

<p>The XSetWindowColormap function sets the specified
colormap of the specified window. The colormap must have the
same visual type as the window, or a BadMatch error
results.</p>

<p>XSetWindowColormap can generate BadColor, BadMatch, and
BadWindow errors.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS BadAccess A client attempted to free a color
map entry that it did not already allocate.</p>

<p>BadAccess A client attempted to store into a read-only
color map entry.</p>

<p>BadColor A value for a Colormap argument does not name a
defined Col- ormap.</p>

<p>BadCursor A value for a Cursor argument does not name a
defined Cursor.</p>

<p>BadMatch Some argument or pair of arguments has the
correct type and range but fails to match in some other way
required by the request.</p>

<p>BadMatch An InputOnly window locks this attribute.</p>

<p>BadPixmap A value for a Pixmap argument does not name a
defined Pixmap.</p>

<p>BadValue Some numeric value falls outside the range of
values accepted by the request. Unless a specific range is
specified for an argument, the full range defined by the
argument s type is accepted. Any argument defined as a set
of alternatives can generate this error.</p>

<p>BadWindow A value for a Window argument does not name a
defined Window.</p>
