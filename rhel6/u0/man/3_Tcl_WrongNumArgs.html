<p>Tcl_WrongNumArgs(3) Tcl Library Procedures
Tcl_WrongNumArgs(3)</p>


<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME Tcl_WrongNumArgs - generate standard error message
for wrong number of arguments</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tcl.h&gt;</p>

<p>Tcl_WrongNumArgs(interp, objc, objv, message)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS Tcl_Interp interp (in) Interpreter in which
error will be reported: error message gets stored in its
result object.</p>

<p>int objc (in) Number of leading arguments from objv to
include in error message.</p>

<p>Tcl_Obj *const objv[] (in) Arguments to command that had
the wrong number of arguments.</p>

<p>const char *message (in) Additional error information to
print after leading arguments from objv. This typically
gives the acceptable syntax of the com- mand. This argument
may be NULL.

<p>DESCRIPTION Tcl_WrongNumArgs is a utility procedure that
is invoked by command pro- cedures when they discover that
they have received the wrong number of arguments.
Tcl_WrongNumArgs generates a standard error message and
stores it in the result object of interp. The message
includes the objc initial elements of objv plus message. For
example, if objv con- sists of the values foo and bar, objc
is 1, and message is fileName count then interps result
object will be set to the following string: wrong # args:
should be &quot;foo fileName count&quot; If objc is 2, the
result will be set to the following string: wrong # args:
should be &quot;foo bar fileName count&quot; Objc is usually
1, but may be 2 or more for commands like string and the Tk
widget commands, which use the first argument as a
subcommand.</p>

<p>Some of the objects in the objv array may be
abbreviations for a sub- command. The command
Tcl_GetIndexFromObj will convert the abbreviated string
object into an indexObject. If an error occurs in the
parsing of the subcommand we would like to use the full
subcommand name rather than the abbreviation. If the
Tcl_WrongNumArgs command finds any indexObjects in the objv
array it will use the full subcommand name in the error
message instead of the abbreviated name that was originally
passed in. Using the above example, let us assume that bar
is actually an abbreviation for barfly and the object is now
an indexObject because it was passed to Tcl_GetIndexFromObj.
In this case the error message would be: wrong # args:
should be &quot;foo barfly fileName count&quot;</p>
