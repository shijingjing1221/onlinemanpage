<p>GCC(1) GNU GCC(1)</p>

<p>NAME gcc - GNU project C and C++ compiler</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS gcc [-c|-S|-E] [-std=standard] [-g] [-pg]
[-Olevel] [-Wwarn...] [-pedantic] [-Idir...] [-Ldir...]
[-Dmacro[=defn]...] [-Umacro] [-foption...]
[-mmachine-option...] [-o outfile] [@file] infile...</p>

<p>Only the most useful options are listed here; see below
for the remainder. g++ accepts mostly the same options as
gcc.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION When you invoke GCC, it normally does
preprocessing, compilation, assembly and linking. The
&quot;overall options&quot; allow you to stop this process
at an intermediate stage. For example, the -c option says
not to run the linker. Then the output consists of object
files output by the assembler.</p>

<p>Other options are passed on to one stage of processing.
Some options control the preprocessor and others the
compiler itself. Yet other options control the assembler and
linker; most of these are not documented here, since you
rarely need to use any of them.</p>

<p>Most of the command line options that you can use with
GCC are useful for C programs; when an option is only useful
with another language (usually C++), the explanation says so
explicitly. If the description for a particular option does
not mention a source language, you can use that option with
all supported languages.</p>

<p>The gcc program accepts options and file names as
operands. Many options have multi-letter names; therefore
multiple single-letter options may not be grouped: -dv is
very different from -d -v.</p>

<p>You can mix options and other arguments. For the most
part, the order you use doesn t matter. Order does matter
when you use several options of the same kind; for example,
if you specify -L more than once, the directories are
searched in the order specified. Also, the placement of the
-l option is significant.</p>

<p>Many options have long names starting with -f or with
-W---for example, -fmove-loop-invariants, -Wformat and so
on. Most of these have both positive and negative forms; the
negative form of -ffoo would be -fno-foo. This manual
documents only one of these two forms, whichever one is not
the default.</p>

options, grouped by type. Explanations are in the following
sections.</p>

<p>Options Controlling the Kind of Output Compilation can
involve up to four stages: preprocessing, compilation
proper, assembly and linking, always in that order. GCC is
capable of preprocessing and compiling several files either
into several assembler input files, or into one assembler
input file; then each assembler input file produces an
object file, and linking combines all the object files
(those newly compiled, and those specified as input) into an
executable file.</p>

<p>For any given input file, the file name suffix
determines what kind of compilation is done:</p>

<p>file.c C source code which must be preprocessed.</p>

<p>file.i C source code which should not be
preprocessed.</p>

<p>file.ii C++ source code which should not be
preprocessed.</p>

<p>file.m Objective-C source code. Note that you must link
with the libobjc library to make an Objective-C program
work.</p>

<p>file.mi Objective-C source code which should not be
preprocessed.</p>

<p>file.mm file.M Objective-C++ source code. Note that you
must link with the libobjc library to make an Objective-C++
program work. Note that .M refers to a literal capital
M.</p>

<p>file.mii Objective-C++ source code which should not be
preprocessed.</p>

<p>file.h C, C++, Objective-C or Objective-C++ header file
to be turned into a precompiled header.</p>

<p>file.cc file.cp file.cxx file.cpp file.CPP file.c++
file.C C++ source code which must be preprocessed. Note that
in .cxx, the last two letters must both be literally x.
Likewise, .C refers to a literal capital C.</p>

<p>file.mm file.M Objective-C++ source code which must be
preprocessed.</p>

<p>file.mii Objective-C++ source code which should not be
preprocessed.</p>

<p>file.hh file.H file.hp file.hxx file.hpp file.HPP
file.h++ file.tcc C++ header file to be turned into a
precompiled header.</p>

<p>file.f file.for file.ftn Fixed form Fortran source code
which should not be preprocessed.</p>

<p>file.F file.FOR file.fpp file.FPP file.FTN Fixed form
Fortran source code which must be preprocessed (with the
traditional preprocessor).</p>

<p>file.f90 file.f95 file.f03 file.f08 Free form Fortran
source code which should not be preprocessed.</p>

<p>file.F90 file.F95 file.F03 file.F08 Free form Fortran
source code which must be preprocessed (with the traditional
preprocessor).</p>

<p>file.ads Ada source code file which contains a library
unit declaration (a declaration of a package, subprogram, or
generic, or a generic instantiation), or a library unit
renaming declaration (a package, generic, or subprogram
renaming declaration). Such files are also called specs.</p>

<p>file.adb Ada source code file containing a library unit
body (a subprogram or package body). Such files are also
called bodies.</p>

<p>file.s Assembler code.</p>

<p>file.S file.sx Assembler code which must be
preprocessed.</p>

<p>other An object file to be fed straight into linking.
Any file name with no recognized suffix is treated this
way.</p>

<p>You can specify the input language explicitly with the
-x option:</p>

<p>-x language Specify explicitly the language for the
following input files (rather than letting the compiler
choose a default based on the file name suffix). This option
applies to all following input files until the next -x
option. Possible values for language are:</p>

<p>c c-header c-cpp-output c++ c++-header c++-cpp-output
objective-c objective-c-header objective-c-cpp-output
objective-c++ objective-c++-header objective-c++-cpp-output
assembler assembler-with-cpp ada f77 f77-cpp-input f95
f95-cpp-input java</p>

<p>-x none Turn off any specification of a language, so
that subsequent files are handled according to their file
name suffixes (as they are if -x has not been used at
all).</p>

<p>-pass-exit-codes Normally the gcc program will exit with
the code of 1 if any phase of the compiler returns a
non-success return code. If you specify -pass-exit-codes,
the gcc program will instead return with numerically highest
error produced by any phase that returned an error
indication. The C, C++, and Fortran frontends return 4, if
an internal compiler error is encountered.</p>

<p>If you only want some of the stages of compilation, you
can use -x (or filename suffixes) to tell gcc where to
start, and one of the options -c, -S, or -E to say where gcc
is to stop. Note that some combinations (for example, -x
cpp-output -E) instruct gcc to do nothing at all.</p>

<p>-c Compile or assemble the source files, but do not
link. The linking stage simply is not done. The ultimate
output is in the form of an object file for each source
file.</p>

<p>By default, the object file name for a source file is
made by replacing the suffix .c, .i, .s, etc., with .o.</p>

<p>Unrecognized input files, not requiring compilation or
assembly, are ignored.</p>

<p>-S Stop after the stage of compilation proper; do not
assemble. The output is in the form of an assembler code
file for each non- assembler input file specified.</p>

<p>By default, the assembler file name for a source file is
made by replacing the suffix .c, .i, etc., with .s.</p>

<p>Input files that dont require compilation are
ignored.</p>

<p>-E Stop after the preprocessing stage; do not run the
compiler proper. The output is in the form of preprocessed
source code, which is sent to the standard output.</p>

<p>Input files which don t require preprocessing are
ignored.</p>

<p>-o file Place output in file file. This applies
regardless to whatever sort of output is being produced,
whether it be an executable file, an object file, an
assembler file or preprocessed C code.</p>

<p>If -o is not specified, the default is to put an
executable file in a.out, the object file for source.suffix
in source.o, its assembler file in source.s, a precompiled
header file in source.suffix.gch, and all preprocessed C
source on standard output.</p>

<p>-v Print (on standard error output) the commands
executed to run the stages of compilation. Also print the
version number of the compiler driver program and of the
preprocessor and the compiler proper.</p>

<p>-### Like -v except the commands are not executed and
all command arguments are quoted. This is useful for shell
scripts to capture the driver-generated command lines.</p>

<p>-pipe Use pipes rather than temporary files for
communication between the various stages of compilation.
This fails to work on some systems where the assembler is
unable to read from a pipe; but the GNU assembler has no
trouble.</p>

<p>-combine If you are compiling multiple source files,
this option tells the driver to pass all the source files to
the compiler at once (for those languages for which the
compiler can handle this). This will allow intermodule
analysis (IMA) to be performed by the compiler. Currently
the only language for which this is supported is C. If you
pass source files for multiple languages to the driver,
using this option, the driver will invoke the compiler(s)
that support IMA once each, passing each compiler all the
source files appropriate for it. For those languages that do
not support IMA this option will be ignored, and the
compiler will be invoked once for each source file in that
language. If you use this option in conjunction with
-save-temps, the compiler will generate multiple
pre-processed files (one for each source file), but only one
(combined) .o or .s file.</p>

<p>--help Print (on the standard output) a description of
the command line options understood by gcc. If the -v option
is also specified then --help will also be passed on to the
various processes invoked by gcc, so that they can display
the command line options they accept. If the -Wextra option
has also been specified (prior to the --help option), then
command line options which have no documentation associated
with them will also be displayed.</p>

<p>--target-help Print (on the standard output) a
description of target-specific command line options for each
tool. For some targets extra target- specific information
may also be printed.</p>

<p>--help={class|[^]qualifier}[,...] Print (on the standard
output) a description of the command line options understood
by the compiler that fit into all specified classes and
qualifiers. These are the supported classes:</p>

<p>optimizers This will display all of the optimization
options supported by the compiler.</p>

<p>warnings This will display all of the options
controlling warning messages produced by the compiler.</p>

<p>target This will display target-specific options. Unlike
the --target-help option however, target-specific options of
the linker and assembler will not be displayed. This is
because those tools do not currently support the extended
--help= syntax.</p>

<p>params This will display the values recognized by the
--param option.</p>

<p>language This will display the options supported for
language, where language is the name of one of the languages
supported in this version of GCC.</p>

<p>common This will display the options that are common to
all languages.</p>

<p>These are the supported qualifiers:</p>

<p>undocumented Display only those options which are
undocumented.</p>

<p>joined Display options which take an argument that
appears after an equal sign in the same continuous piece of
text, such as: --help=target.</p>

<p>separate Display options which take an argument that
appears as a separate word following the original option,
such as: -o output-file.</p>

<p>Thus for example to display all the undocumented
target-specific switches supported by the compiler the
following can be used:</p>

<p>--help=target,undocumented</p>

<p>The sense of a qualifier can be inverted by prefixing it
with the ^ character, so for example to display all binary
warning options (i.e., ones that are either on or off and
that do not take an argument), which have a description the
following can be used:</p>

<p>--help=warnings,^joined,^undocumented</p>

<p>The argument to --help= should not consist solely of
inverted qualifiers.</p>

<p>Combining several classes is possible, although this
usually restricts the output by so much that there is
nothing to display. One case where it does work however is
when one of the classes is target. So for example to display
all the target-specific optimization options the following
can be used:</p>

<p>--help=target,optimizers</p>

<p>The --help= option can be repeated on the command line.
Each successive use will display its requested class of
options, skipping those that have already been
displayed.</p>

<p>If the -Q option appears on the command line before the
--help= option, then the descriptive text displayed by
--help= is changed. Instead of describing the displayed
options, an indication is given as to whether the option is
enabled, disabled or set to a specific value (assuming that
the compiler knows this at the point where the --help=
option is used).</p>

<p>Here is a truncated example from the ARM port of
gcc:</p>

<p>% gcc -Q -mabi=2 --help=target -c The following options
are target specific: -mabi= 2 -mabort-on-noreturn [disabled]
-mapcs [disabled]</p>

<p>The output is sensitive to the effects of previous
command line options, so for example it is possible to find
out which optimizations are enabled at -O2 by using:</p>

<p>-Q -O2 --help=optimizers</p>

<p>Alternatively you can discover which binary
optimizations are enabled by -O3 by using:</p>

<p>gcc -c -Q -O3 --help=optimizers &gt; /tmp/O3-opts gcc -c
-Q -O2 --help=optimizers &gt; /tmp/O2-opts diff /tmp/O2-opts
/tmp/O3-opts | grep enabled</p>

<p>--version Display the version number and copyrights of
the invoked GCC.</p>

<p>-wrapper Invoke all subcommands under a wrapper program.
It takes a single comma separated list as an argument, which
will be used to invoke the wrapper:</p>

<p>gcc -c t.c -wrapper gdb,--args</p>

<p>This will invoke all subprograms of gcc under &quot;gdb
--args&quot;, thus cc1 invocation will be &quot;gdb --args
cc1 ...&quot;.</p>

<p>@file Read command-line options from file. The options
read are inserted in place of the original @file option. If
file does not exist, or cannot be read, then the option will
be treated literally, and not removed.</p>

<p>Options in file are separated by whitespace. A
whitespace character may be included in an option by
surrounding the entire option in either single or double
quotes. Any character (including a backslash) may be
included by prefixing the character to be included with a
backslash. The file may itself contain additional @file
options; any such options will be processed recursively.</p>

<p>Compiling C++ Programs C++ source files conventionally
use one of the suffixes .C, .cc, .cpp, .CPP, .c++, .cp, or
.cxx; C++ header files often use .hh, .hpp, .H, or (for
shared template code) .tcc; and preprocessed C++ files use
the suffix .ii. GCC recognizes files with these names and
compiles them as C++ programs even if you call the compiler
the same way as for compiling C programs (usually with the
name gcc).</p>

<p>However, the use of gcc does not add the C++ library.
g++ is a program that calls GCC and treats .c, .h and .i
files as C++ source files instead of C source files unless
-x is used, and automatically specifies linking against the
C++ library. This program is also useful when precompiling a
C header file with a .h extension for use in C++
compilations. On many systems, g++ is also installed with
the name c++.</p>

<p>When you compile C++ programs, you may specify many of
the same command-line options that you use for compiling
programs in any language; or command-line options meaningful
for C and related languages; or options that are meaningful
only for C++ programs.</p>

<p>Options Controlling C Dialect The following options
control the dialect of C (or languages derived from C, such
as C++, Objective-C and Objective-C++) that the compiler
accepts:</p>

<p>-ansi In C mode, this is equivalent to -std=c89. In C++
mode, it is equivalent to -std=c++98.</p>

<p>This turns off certain features of GCC that are
incompatible with ISO C90 (when compiling C code), or of
standard C++ (when compiling C++ code), such as the
&quot;asm&quot; and &quot;typeof&quot; keywords, and
predefined macros such as &quot;unix&quot; and
&quot;vax&quot; that identify the type of system you are
using. It also enables the undesirable and rarely used ISO
trigraph feature. For the C compiler, it disables
recognition of C++ style // comments as well as the
&quot;inline&quot; keyword.</p>

<p>The alternate keywords &quot;__asm__&quot;,
&quot;__extension__&quot;, &quot;__inline__&quot; and
&quot;__typeof__&quot; continue to work despite -ansi. You
would not want to use them in an ISO C program, of course,
but it is useful to put them in header files that might be
included in compilations done with -ansi. Alternate
predefined macros such as &quot;__unix__&quot; and
&quot;__vax__&quot; are also available, with or without
-ansi.</p>

<p>The -ansi option does not cause non-ISO programs to be
rejected gratuitously. For that, -pedantic is required in
addition to -ansi.</p>

<p>The macro &quot;__STRICT_ANSI__&quot; is predefined when
the -ansi option is used. Some header files may notice this
macro and refrain from declaring certain functions or
defining certain macros that the ISO standard doesnt call
for; this is to avoid interfering with any programs that
might use these names for other things.</p>

<p>Functions that would normally be built in but do not
have semantics defined by ISO C (such as &quot;alloca&quot;
and &quot;ffs&quot;) are not built-in functions when -ansi
is used.</p>

<p>-std= Determine the language standard. This option is
currently only supported when compiling C or C++.</p>

<p>The compiler can accept several base standards, such as
c89 or c++98, and GNU dialects of those standards, such as
gnu89 or gnu++98. By specifying a base standard, the
compiler will accept all programs following that standard
and those using GNU extensions that do not contradict it.
For example, -std=c89 turns off certain features of GCC that
are incompatible with ISO C90, such as the &quot;asm&quot;
and &quot;typeof&quot; keywords, but not other GNU
extensions that do not have a meaning in ISO C90, such as
omitting the middle term of a &quot;?:&quot; expression. On
the other hand, by specifying a GNU dialect of a standard,
all features the compiler support are enabled, even when
those features change the meaning of the base standard and
some strict-conforming programs may be rejected. The
particular standard is used by -pedantic to identify which
features are GNU extensions given that version of the
standard. For example -std=gnu89 -pedantic would warn about
C++ style // comments, while -std=gnu99 -pedantic would
not.</p>

<p>A value for this option must be provided; possible
values are</p>

<p>c89 iso9899:1990 Support all ISO C90 programs (certain
GNU extensions that conflict with ISO C90 are disabled).
Same as -ansi for C code.</p>

<p>iso9899:199409 ISO C90 as modified in amendment 1.</p>

<p>c99 c9x iso9899:1999 iso9899:199x ISO C99. Note that
this standard is not yet fully supported; see
&lt;http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.4/c99status.html&gt; for more
information. The names c9x and iso9899:199x are
deprecated.</p>

<p>gnu89 GNU dialect of ISO C90 (including some C99
features). This is the default for C code.</p>

<p>gnu99 gnu9x GNU dialect of ISO C99. When ISO C99 is
fully implemented in GCC, this will become the default. The
name gnu9x is deprecated.</p>

<p>c++98 The 1998 ISO C++ standard plus amendments. Same as
-ansi for C++ code.</p>

<p>gnu++98 GNU dialect of -std=c++98. This is the default
for C++ code.</p>

<p>c++0x The working draft of the upcoming ISO C++0x
standard. This option enables experimental features that are
likely to be included in C++0x. The working draft is
constantly changing, and any feature that is enabled by this
flag may be removed from future versions of GCC if it is not
part of the C++0x standard.</p>

<p>gnu++0x GNU dialect of -std=c++0x. This option enables
experimental features that may be removed in future versions
of GCC.</p>

<p>-fgnu89-inline The option -fgnu89-inline tells GCC to
use the traditional GNU semantics for &quot;inline&quot;
functions when in C99 mode. This option is accepted and
ignored by GCC versions 4.1.3 up to but not including 4.3.
In GCC versions 4.3 and later it changes the behavior of GCC
in C99 mode. Using this option is roughly equivalent to
adding the &quot;gnu_inline&quot; function attribute to all
inline functions.</p>

<p>The option -fno-gnu89-inline explicitly tells GCC to use
the C99 semantics for &quot;inline&quot; when in C99 or
gnu99 mode (i.e., it specifies the default behavior). This
option was first supported in GCC 4.3. This option is not
supported in C89 or gnu89 mode.</p>

<p>The preprocessor macros &quot;__GNUC_GNU_INLINE__&quot;
and &quot;__GNUC_STDC_INLINE__&quot; may be used to check
which semantics are in effect for &quot;inline&quot;
functions.</p>

<p>-aux-info filename Output to the given filename
prototyped declarations for all functions declared and/or
defined in a translation unit, including those in header
files. This option is silently ignored in any language other
than C.</p>

<p>Besides declarations, the file indicates, in comments,
the origin of each declaration (source file and line),
whether the declaration was implicit, prototyped or
unprototyped (I, N for new or O for old, respectively, in
the first character after the line number and the colon),
and whether it came from a declaration or a definition (C or
F, respectively, in the following character). In the case of
function definitions, a K&amp;R-style list of arguments
followed by their declarations is also provided, inside
comments, after the declaration.</p>

<p>-fno-asm Do not recognize &quot;asm&quot;,
&quot;inline&quot; or &quot;typeof&quot; as a keyword, so
that code can use these words as identifiers. You can use
the keywords &quot;__asm__&quot;, &quot;__inline__&quot; and
&quot;__typeof__&quot; instead. -ansi implies -fno-asm.</p>

<p>In C++, this switch only affects the &quot;typeof&quot;
keyword, since &quot;asm&quot; and &quot;inline&quot; are
standard keywords. You may want to use the -fno-gnu-keywords
flag instead, which has the same effect. In C99 mode
(-std=c99 or -std=gnu99), this switch only affects the
&quot;asm&quot; and &quot;typeof&quot; keywords, since
&quot;inline&quot; is a standard keyword in ISO C99.</p>

<p>-fno-builtin -fno-builtin-function Dont recognize
built-in functions that do not begin with __builtin_ as
prefix.</p>

<p>GCC normally generates special code to handle certain
built-in functions more efficiently; for instance, calls to
&quot;alloca&quot; may become single instructions that
adjust the stack directly, and calls to &quot;memcpy&quot;
may become inline copy loops. The resulting code is often
both smaller and faster, but since the function calls no
longer appear as such, you cannot set a breakpoint on those
calls, nor can you change the behavior of the functions by
linking with a different library. In addition, when a
function is recognized as a built-in function, GCC may use
information about that function to warn about problems with
calls to that function, or to generate more efficient code,
even if the resulting code still contains calls to that
function. For example, warnings are given with -Wformat for
bad calls to &quot;printf&quot;, when &quot;printf&quot; is
built in, and &quot;strlen&quot; is known not to modify
global memory.</p>

<p>With the -fno-builtin-function option only the built-in
function function is disabled. function must not begin with
__builtin_. If a function is named that is not built-in in
this version of GCC, this option is ignored. There is no
corresponding -fbuiltin-function option; if you wish to
enable built-in functions selectively when using
-fno-builtin or -ffreestanding, you may define macros such
as:</p>

<p>#define abs(n) __builtin_abs ((n)) #define strcpy(d, s)
__builtin_strcpy ((d), (s))</p>

<p>-fhosted Assert that compilation takes place in a hosted
environment. This implies -fbuiltin. A hosted environment is
one in which the entire standard library is available, and
in which &quot;main&quot; has a return type of
&quot;int&quot;. Examples are nearly everything except a
kernel. This is equivalent to -fno-freestanding.</p>

<p>-ffreestanding Assert that compilation takes place in a
freestanding environment. This implies -fno-builtin. A
freestanding environment is one in which the standard
library may not exist, and program startup may not
necessarily be at &quot;main&quot;. The most obvious example
is an OS kernel. This is equivalent to -fno-hosted.</p>

<p>-fopenmp Enable handling of OpenMP directives
&quot;#pragma omp&quot; in C/C++ and &quot;!$omp&quot; in
Fortran. When -fopenmp is specified, the compiler generates
parallel code according to the OpenMP Application Program
Interface v2.5 &lt;http://www.openmp.org/&gt;. This option
implies -pthread, and thus is only supported on targets that
have support for -pthread.</p>

<p>-fms-extensions Accept some non-standard constructs used
in Microsoft header files.</p>

<p>Some cases of unnamed fields in structures and unions
are only accepted with this option.</p>

<p>-trigraphs Support ISO C trigraphs. The -ansi option
(and -std options for strict ISO C conformance) implies
-trigraphs.</p>

<p>-no-integrated-cpp Performs a compilation in two passes:
preprocessing and compiling. This option allows a user
supplied &quot;cc1&quot;, &quot;cc1plus&quot;, or
&quot;cc1obj&quot; via the -B option. The user supplied
compilation step can then add in an additional preprocessing
step after normal preprocessing but before compiling. The
default is to use the integrated cpp (internal cpp)</p>

<p>The semantics of this option will change if
&quot;cc1&quot;, &quot;cc1plus&quot;, and &quot;cc1obj&quot;
are merged.</p>

<p>-traditional -traditional-cpp Formerly, these options
caused GCC to attempt to emulate a pre- standard C compiler.
They are now only supported with the -E switch. The
preprocessor continues to support a pre-standard mode. See
the GNU CPP manual for details.</p>

<p>-fcond-mismatch Allow conditional expressions with
mismatched types in the second and third arguments. The
value of such an expression is void. This option is not
supported for C++.</p>

<p>-flax-vector-conversions Allow implicit conversions
between vectors with differing numbers of elements and/or
incompatible element types. This option should not be used
for new code.</p>

<p>-funsigned-char Let the type &quot;char&quot; be
unsigned, like &quot;unsigned char&quot;.</p>

<p>Each kind of machine has a default for what
&quot;char&quot; should be. It is either like &quot;unsigned
char&quot; by default or like &quot;signed char&quot; by
default.</p>

<p>Ideally, a portable program should always use
&quot;signed char&quot; or &quot;unsigned char&quot; when it
depends on the signedness of an object. But many programs
have been written to use plain &quot;char&quot; and expect
it to be signed, or expect it to be unsigned, depending on
the machines they were written for. This option, and its
inverse, let you make such a program work with the opposite
default.</p>

<p>The type &quot;char&quot; is always a distinct type from
each of &quot;signed char&quot; or &quot;unsigned
char&quot;, even though its behavior is always just like one
of those two.</p>

<p>-fsigned-char Let the type &quot;char&quot; be signed,
like &quot;signed char&quot;.</p>

<p>Note that this is equivalent to -fno-unsigned-char,
which is the negative form of -funsigned-char. Likewise, the
option -fno-signed-char is equivalent to
-funsigned-char.</p>

<p>-fsigned-bitfields -funsigned-bitfields
-fno-signed-bitfields -fno-unsigned-bitfields These options
control whether a bit-field is signed or unsigned, when the
declaration does not use either &quot;signed&quot; or
&quot;unsigned&quot;. By default, such a bit-field is
signed, because this is consistent: the basic integer types
such as &quot;int&quot; are signed types.</p>

<p>Options Controlling C++ Dialect This section describes
the command-line options that are only meaningful for C++
programs; but you can also use most of the GNU compiler
options regardless of what language your program is in. For
example, you might compile a file &quot;firstClass.C&quot;
like this:</p>

<p>g++ -g -frepo -O -c firstClass.C</p>

<p>In this example, only -frepo is an option meant only for
C++ programs; you can use the other options with any
language supported by GCC.</p>

<p>Here is a list of options that are only for compiling
C++ programs:</p>

<p>-fabi-version=n Use version n of the C++ ABI. Version 2
is the version of the C++ ABI that first appeared in G++
3.4. Version 1 is the version of the C++ ABI that first
appeared in G++ 3.2. Version 0 will always be the version
that conforms most closely to the C++ ABI specification.
Therefore, the ABI obtained using version 0 will change as
ABI bugs are fixed.</p>

<p>The default is version 2.</p>

<p>-fno-access-control Turn off all access checking. This
switch is mainly useful for working around bugs in the
access control code.</p>

<p>-fcheck-new Check that the pointer returned by
&quot;operator new&quot; is non-null before attempting to
modify the storage allocated. This check is normally
unnecessary because the C++ standard specifies that
&quot;operator new&quot; will only return 0 if it is
declared throw(), in which case the compiler will always
check the return value even without this option. In all
other cases, when &quot;operator new&quot; has a non-empty
exception specification, memory exhaustion is signalled by
throwing &quot;std::bad_alloc&quot;. See also new
(nothrow).</p>

<p>-fconserve-space Put uninitialized or
runtime-initialized global variables into the common
segment, as C does. This saves space in the executable at
the cost of not diagnosing duplicate definitions. If you
compile with this flag and your program mysteriously crashes
after &quot;main()&quot; has completed, you may have an
object that is being destroyed twice because two definitions
were merged.</p>

<p>This option is no longer useful on most targets, now
that support has been added for putting variables into BSS
without making them common.</p>

<p>-fno-deduce-init-list Disable deduction of a template
type parameter as std::initializer_list from a
brace-enclosed initializer list, i.e.</p>

<p>template &lt;class T&gt; auto forward(T t) -&gt;
decltype (realfn (t)) { return realfn (t); }</p>

<p>void f() { forward({1,2}); // call
forward&lt;std::initializer_list&lt;int&gt;&gt; }</p>

<p>This option is present because this deduction is an
extension to the current specification in the C++0x working
draft, and there was some concern about potential overload
resolution problems.</p>

<p>-ffriend-injection Inject friend functions into the
enclosing namespace, so that they are visible outside the
scope of the class in which they are declared. Friend
functions were documented to work this way in the old
Annotated C++ Reference Manual, and versions of G++ before
4.1 always worked that way. However, in ISO C++ a friend
function which is not declared in an enclosing scope can
only be found using argument dependent lookup. This option
causes friends to be injected as they were in earlier
releases.</p>

<p>This option is for compatibility, and may be removed in
a future release of G++.</p>

<p>-fno-elide-constructors The C++ standard allows an
implementation to omit creating a temporary which is only
used to initialize another object of the same type.
Specifying this option disables that optimization, and
forces G++ to call the copy constructor in all cases.</p>

<p>-fno-enforce-eh-specs Dont generate code to check for
violation of exception specifications at runtime. This
option violates the C++ standard, but may be useful for
reducing code size in production builds, much like defining
NDEBUG. This does not give user code permission to throw
exceptions in violation of the exception specifications; the
compiler will still optimize based on the specifications, so
throwing an unexpected exception will result in undefined
behavior.</p>

<p>-ffor-scope -fno-for-scope If -ffor-scope is specified,
the scope of variables declared in a for-init-statement is
limited to the for loop itself, as specified by the C++
standard. If -fno-for-scope is specified, the scope of
variables declared in a for-init-statement extends to the
end of the enclosing scope, as was the case in old versions
of G++, and other (traditional) implementations of C++.</p>

<p>The default if neither flag is given to follow the
standard, but to allow and give a warning for old-style code
that would otherwise be invalid, or have different
behavior.</p>

<p>-fno-gnu-keywords Do not recognize &quot;typeof&quot; as
a keyword, so that code can use this word as an identifier.
You can use the keyword &quot;__typeof__&quot; instead.
-ansi implies -fno-gnu-keywords.</p>

<p>-fno-implicit-templates Never emit code for non-inline
templates which are instantiated implicitly (i.e. by use);
only emit code for explicit instantiations.</p>

<p>-fno-implicit-inline-templates Don t emit code for
implicit instantiations of inline templates, either. The
default is to handle inlines differently so that compiles
with and without optimization will need the same set of
explicit instantiations.</p>

<p>-fno-implement-inlines To save space, do not emit
out-of-line copies of inline functions controlled by #pragma
implementation. This will cause linker errors if these
functions are not inlined everywhere they are called.</p>

<p>-fms-extensions Disable pedantic warnings about
constructs used in MFC, such as implicit int and getting a
pointer to member function via non- standard syntax.</p>

<p>-fno-nonansi-builtins Disable built-in declarations of
functions that are not mandated by ANSI/ISO C. These include
&quot;ffs&quot;, &quot;alloca&quot;, &quot;_exit&quot;,
&quot;index&quot;, &quot;bzero&quot;, &quot;conjf&quot;, and
other related functions.</p>

<p>-fno-operator-names Do not treat the operator name
keywords &quot;and&quot;, &quot;bitand&quot;,
&quot;bitor&quot;, &quot;compl&quot;, &quot;not&quot;,
&quot;or&quot; and &quot;xor&quot; as synonyms as
keywords.</p>

<p>-fno-optional-diags Disable diagnostics that the
standard says a compiler does not need to issue. Currently,
the only such diagnostic issued by G++ is the one for a name
having multiple meanings within a class.</p>

<p>-fpermissive Downgrade some diagnostics about
nonconformant code from errors to warnings. Thus, using
-fpermissive will allow some nonconforming code to
compile.</p>

<p>-frepo Enable automatic template instantiation at link
time. This option also implies -fno-implicit-templates.</p>

<p>-fno-rtti Disable generation of information about every
class with virtual functions for use by the C++ runtime type
identification features (dynamic_cast and typeid). If you
dont use those parts of the language, you can save some
space by using this flag. Note that exception handling uses
the same information, but it will generate it as needed. The
dynamic_cast operator can still be used for casts that do
not require runtime type information, i.e. casts to
&quot;void *&quot; or to unambiguous base classes.</p>

<p>-fstats Emit statistics about front-end processing at
the end of the compilation. This information is generally
only useful to the G++ development team.</p>

<p>-ftemplate-depth-n Set the maximum instantiation depth
for template classes to n. A limit on the template
instantiation depth is needed to detect endless recursions
during template class instantiation. ANSI/ISO C++ conforming
programs must not rely on a maximum depth greater than
17.</p>

<p>-fno-threadsafe-statics Do not emit the extra code to
use the routines specified in the C++ ABI for thread-safe
initialization of local statics. You can use this option to
reduce code size slightly in code that doesnt need to be
thread-safe.</p>

<p>-fuse-cxa-atexit Register destructors for objects with
static storage duration with the &quot;__cxa_atexit&quot;
function rather than the &quot;atexit&quot; function. This
option is required for fully standards-compliant handling of
static destructors, but will only work if your C library
supports &quot;__cxa_atexit&quot;.</p>

<p>-fno-use-cxa-get-exception-ptr Don t use the
&quot;__cxa_get_exception_ptr&quot; runtime routine. This
will cause &quot;std::uncaught_exception&quot; to be
incorrect, but is necessary if the runtime routine is not
available.</p>

<p>-fvisibility-inlines-hidden This switch declares that
the user does not attempt to compare pointers to inline
methods where the addresses of the two functions were taken
in different shared objects.</p>

<p>The effect of this is that GCC may, effectively, mark
inline methods with &quot;__attribute__ ((visibility
(&quot;hidden&quot;)))&quot; so that they do not appear in
the export table of a DSO and do not require a PLT
indirection when used within the DSO. Enabling this option
can have a dramatic effect on load and link times of a DSO
as it massively reduces the size of the dynamic export table
when the library makes heavy use of templates.</p>

<p>The behavior of this switch is not quite the same as
marking the methods as hidden directly, because it does not
affect static variables local to the function or cause the
compiler to deduce that the function is defined in only one
shared object.</p>

<p>You may mark a method as having a visibility explicitly
to negate the effect of the switch for that method. For
example, if you do want to compare pointers to a particular
inline method, you might mark it as having default
visibility. Marking the enclosing class with explicit
visibility will have no effect.</p>

<p>Explicitly instantiated inline methods are unaffected by
this option as their linkage might otherwise cross a shared
library boundary.</p>

<p>-fvisibility-ms-compat This flag attempts to use
visibility settings to make GCCs C++ linkage model
compatible with that of Microsoft Visual Studio.</p>

<p>The flag makes these changes to GCCs linkage model:</p>

<p>1. It sets the default visibility to &quot;hidden&quot;,
like -fvisibility=hidden.</p>

<p>2. Types, but not their members, are not hidden by
default.</p>

<p>3. The One Definition Rule is relaxed for types without
explicit visibility specifications which are defined in more
than one different shared object: those declarations are
permitted if they would have been permitted when this option
was not used.</p>

<p>In new code it is better to use -fvisibility=hidden and
export those classes which are intended to be externally
visible. Unfortunately it is possible for code to rely,
perhaps accidentally, on the Visual Studio behavior.</p>

<p>Among the consequences of these changes are that static
data members of the same type with the same name but defined
in different shared objects will be different, so changing
one will not change the other; and that pointers to function
members defined in different shared objects may not compare
equal. When this flag is given, it is a violation of the ODR
to define types with the same name differently.</p>

<p>-fno-weak Do not use weak symbol support, even if it is
provided by the linker. By default, G++ will use weak
symbols if they are available. This option exists only for
testing, and should not be used by end-users; it will result
in inferior code and has no benefits. This option may be
removed in a future release of G++.</p>

<p>-nostdinc++ Do not search for header files in the
standard directories specific to C++, but do still search
the other standard directories. (This option is used when
building the C++ library.)</p>

<p>In addition, these optimization, warning, and code
generation options have meanings only for C++ programs:</p>

<p>-fno-default-inline Do not assume inline for functions
defined inside a class scope. Note that these functions will
have linkage like inline functions; they just wont be
inlined by default.</p>

<p>-Wabi (C, Objective-C, C++ and Objective-C++ only) Warn
when G++ generates code that is probably not compatible with
the vendor-neutral C++ ABI. Although an effort has been made
to warn about all such cases, there are probably some cases
that are not warned about, even though G++ is generating
incompatible code. There may also be cases where warnings
are emitted even though the code that is generated will be
compatible.</p>

<p>You should rewrite your code to avoid these warnings if
you are concerned about the fact that code generated by G++
may not be binary compatible with code generated by other
compilers.</p>

<p>The known incompatibilities at this point include:</p>

<p>&middot; Incorrect handling of tail-padding for
bit-fields. G++ may attempt to pack data into the same byte
as a base class. For example:</p>

<p>struct A { virtual void f(); int f1 : 1; }; struct B :
public A { int f2 : 1; };</p>

<p>In this case, G++ will place &quot;B::f2&quot; into the
same byte as&quot;A::f1&quot;; other compilers will not. You
can avoid this problem by explicitly padding &quot;A&quot;
so that its size is a multiple of the byte size on your
platform; that will cause G++ and other compilers to layout
&quot;B&quot; identically.</p>

<p>&middot; Incorrect handling of tail-padding for virtual
bases. G++ does not use tail padding when laying out virtual
bases. For example:</p>

<p>struct A { virtual void f(); char c1; }; struct B { B();
char c2; }; struct C : public A, public virtual B {};</p>

<p>In this case, G++ will not place &quot;B&quot; into the
tail-padding for &quot;A&quot;; other compilers will. You
can avoid this problem by explicitly padding &quot;A&quot;
so that its size is a multiple of its alignment (ignoring
virtual base classes); that will cause G++ and other
compilers to layout &quot;C&quot; identically.</p>

<p>&middot; Incorrect handling of bit-fields with declared
widths greater than that of their underlying types, when the
bit-fields appear in a union. For example:</p>

<p>union U { int i : 4096; };</p>

<p>Assuming that an &quot;int&quot; does not have 4096
bits, G++ will make the union too small by the number of
bits in an &quot;int&quot;.</p>

<p>&middot; Empty classes can be placed at incorrect
offsets. For example:</p>

<p>struct A {};</p>

<p>struct B { A a; virtual void f (); };</p>

<p>struct C : public B, public A {};</p>

<p>G++ will place the &quot;A&quot; base class of
&quot;C&quot; at a nonzero offset; it should be placed at
offset zero. G++ mistakenly believes that the &quot;A&quot;
data member of &quot;B&quot; is already at offset zero.</p>

<p>&middot; Names of template functions whose types involve
&quot;typename&quot; or template template parameters can be
mangled incorrectly.</p>

<p>template &lt;typename Q&gt; void f(typename Q::X) {}</p>

<p>template &lt;template &lt;typename&gt; class Q&gt; void
f(typename Q&lt;int&gt;::X) {}</p>

<p>Instantiations of these templates may be mangled
incorrectly.</p>

<p>It also warns psABI related changes. The known psABI
changes at this point include:</p>

<p>&middot; For SYSV/x86-64, when passing union with long
double, it is changed to pass in memory as specified in
psABI. For example:</p>

<p>union U { long double ld; int i; };</p>

<p>&quot;union U&quot; will always be passed in memory.</p>

<p>-Wctor-dtor-privacy (C++ and Objective-C++ only) Warn
when a class seems unusable because all the constructors or
destructors in that class are private, and it has neither
friends nor public static member functions.</p>

<p>-Wnon-virtual-dtor (C++ and Objective-C++ only) Warn
when a class has virtual functions and accessible
non-virtual destructor, in which case it would be possible
but unsafe to delete an instance of a derived class through
a pointer to the base class. This warning is also enabled if
-Weffc++ is specified.</p>

<p>-Wreorder (C++ and Objective-C++ only) Warn when the
order of member initializers given in the code does not
match the order in which they must be executed. For
instance:</p>

<p>struct A { int i; int j; A(): j (0), i (1) { } };</p>

<p>The compiler will rearrange the member initializers for
i and j to match the declaration order of the members,
emitting a warning to that effect. This warning is enabled
by -Wall.</p>

<p>The following -W... options are not affected by
-Wall.</p>

<p>-Weffc++ (C++ and Objective-C++ only) Warn about
violations of the following style guidelines from Scott
Meyers Effective C++ book:</p>

<p>&middot; Item 11: Define a copy constructor and an
assignment operator for classes with dynamically allocated
memory.</p>

<p>&middot; Item 12: Prefer initialization to assignment in
constructors.</p>

<p>&middot; Item 14: Make destructors virtual in base
classes.</p>

<p>&middot; Item 15: Have &quot;operator=&quot; return a
reference to *this.</p>

<p>&middot; Item 23: Dont try to return a reference when
you must return an object.</p>

<p>Also warn about violations of the following style
guidelines from Scott Meyers More Effective C++ book:</p>

<p>&middot; Item 6: Distinguish between prefix and postfix
forms of increment and decrement operators.</p>

<p>&middot; Item 7: Never overload &quot;&amp;&amp;&quot;,
&quot;||&quot;, or &quot;,&quot;.</p>

<p>When selecting this option, be aware that the standard
library headers do not obey all of these guidelines; use
grep -v to filter out those warnings.</p>

<p>-Wstrict-null-sentinel (C++ and Objective-C++ only) Warn
also about the use of an uncasted &quot;NULL&quot; as
sentinel. When compiling only with GCC this is a valid
sentinel, as &quot;NULL&quot; is defined to
&quot;__null&quot;. Although it is a null pointer constant
not a null pointer, it is guaranteed to be of the same size
as a pointer. But this use is not portable across different
compilers.</p>

<p>-Wno-non-template-friend (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
Disable warnings when non-templatized friend functions are
declared within a template. Since the advent of explicit
template specification support in G++, if the name of the
friend is an unqualified-id (i.e., friend foo(int)), the C++
language specification demands that the friend declare or
define an ordinary, nontemplate function. (Section 14.5.3).
Before G++ implemented explicit specification,
unqualified-ids could be interpreted as a particular
specialization of a templatized function. Because this
non-conforming behavior is no longer the default behavior
for G++, -Wnon-template-friend allows the compiler to check
existing code for potential trouble spots and is on by
default. This new compiler behavior can be turned off with
-Wno-non-template-friend which keeps the conformant compiler
code but disables the helpful warning.</p>

<p>-Wold-style-cast (C++ and Objective-C++ only) Warn if an
old-style (C-style) cast to a non-void type is used within a
C++ program. The new-style casts (dynamic_cast, static_cast,
reinterpret_cast, and const_cast) are less vulnerable to
unintended effects and much easier to search for.</p>

<p>-Woverloaded-virtual (C++ and Objective-C++ only) Warn
when a function declaration hides virtual functions from a
base class. For example, in:</p>

<p>struct A { virtual void f(); };</p>

<p>struct B: public A { void f(int); };</p>

<p>the &quot;A&quot; class version of &quot;f&quot; is
hidden in &quot;B&quot;, and code like:</p>

<p>B* b; b-&gt;f();</p>

<p>will fail to compile.</p>

<p>-Wno-pmf-conversions (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
Disable the diagnostic for converting a bound pointer to
member function to a plain pointer.</p>

<p>-Wsign-promo (C++ and Objective-C++ only) Warn when
overload resolution chooses a promotion from unsigned or
enumerated type to a signed type, over a conversion to an
unsigned type of the same size. Previous versions of G++
would try to preserve unsignedness, but the standard
mandates the current behavior.</p>

<p>struct A { operator int (); A&amp; operator = (int);
};</p>

<p>main () { A a,b; a = b; }</p>

<p>In this example, G++ will synthesize a default A&amp;
operator = (const A&amp;);, while cfront will use the
user-defined operator =.</p>

<p>Options Controlling Objective-C and Objective-C++
Dialects (NOTE: This manual does not describe the
Objective-C and Objective-C++ languages themselves. See</p>

<p>This section describes the command-line options that are
only meaningful for Objective-C and Objective-C++ programs,
but you can also use most of the language-independent GNU
compiler options. For example, you might compile a file
&quot;some_class.m&quot; like this:</p>

<p>gcc -g -fgnu-runtime -O -c some_class.m</p>

<p>In this example, -fgnu-runtime is an option meant only
for Objective-C and Objective-C++ programs; you can use the
other options with any language supported by GCC.</p>

<p>Note that since Objective-C is an extension of the C
language, Objective-C compilations may also use options
specific to the C front- end (e.g., -Wtraditional).
Similarly, Objective-C++ compilations may use C++-specific
options (e.g., -Wabi).</p>

<p>Here is a list of options that are only for compiling
Objective-C and Objective-C++ programs:</p>

<p>-fconstant-string-class=class-name Use class-name as the
name of the class to instantiate for each literal string
specified with the syntax &quot;@&quot;...&quot;&quot;. The
default class name is &quot;NXConstantString&quot; if the
GNU runtime is being used, and &quot;NSConstantString&quot;
if the NeXT runtime is being used (see below). The
-fconstant-cfstrings option, if also present, will override
the -fconstant-string-class setting and cause
&quot;@&quot;...&quot;&quot; literals to be laid out as
constant CoreFoundation strings.</p>

<p>-fgnu-runtime Generate object code compatible with the
standard GNU Objective-C runtime. This is the default for
most types of systems.</p>

<p>-fnext-runtime Generate output compatible with the NeXT
runtime. This is the default for NeXT-based systems,
including Darwin and Mac OS X. The macro
&quot;__NEXT_RUNTIME__&quot; is predefined if (and only if)
this option is used.</p>

<p>-fno-nil-receivers Assume that all Objective-C message
dispatches (e.g., &quot;[receiver message:arg]&quot;) in
this translation unit ensure that the receiver is not
&quot;nil&quot;. This allows for more efficient entry points
in the runtime to be used. Currently, this option is only
available in conjunction with the NeXT runtime on Mac OS X
10.3 and later.</p>

<p>-fobjc-call-cxx-cdtors For each Objective-C class, check
if any of its instance variables is a C++ object with a
non-trivial default constructor. If so, synthesize a special
&quot;- (id) .cxx_construct&quot; instance method that will
run non-trivial default constructors on any such instance
variables, in order, and then return &quot;self&quot;.
Similarly, check if any instance variable is a C++ object
with a non-trivial destructor, and if so, synthesize a
special &quot;- (void) .cxx_destruct&quot; method that will
run all such default destructors, in reverse order.</p>

<p>The &quot;- (id) .cxx_construct&quot; and/or &quot;-
(void) .cxx_destruct&quot; methods thusly generated will
only operate on instance variables declared in the current
Objective-C class, and not those inherited from
superclasses. It is the responsibility of the Objective-C
runtime to invoke all such methods in an objects inheritance
hierarchy. The &quot;- (id) .cxx_construct&quot; methods
will be invoked by the runtime immediately after a new
object instance is allocated; the &quot;- (void)
.cxx_destruct&quot; methods will be invoked immediately
before the runtime deallocates an object instance.</p>

<p>As of this writing, only the NeXT runtime on Mac OS X
10.4 and later has support for invoking the &quot;- (id)
.cxx_construct&quot; and &quot;- (void) .cxx_destruct&quot;
methods.</p>

<p>-fobjc-direct-dispatch Allow fast jumps to the message
dispatcher. On Darwin this is accomplished via the comm
page.</p>

<p>-fobjc-exceptions Enable syntactic support for
structured exception handling in Objective-C, similar to
what is offered by C++ and Java. This option is unavailable
in conjunction with the NeXT runtime on Mac OS X 10.2 and
earlier.</p>

<p>@try { ... @throw expr; ... } @catch (AnObjCClass *exc)
{ ... @throw expr; ... @throw; ... } @catch (AnotherClass
*exc) { ... } @catch (id allOthers) { ... } @finally { ...
@throw expr; ... }</p>

<p>The @throw statement may appear anywhere in an
Objective-C or Objective-C++ program; when used inside of a
@catch block, the @throw may appear without an argument (as
shown above), in which case the object caught by the @catch
will be rethrown.</p>

<p>Note that only (pointers to) Objective-C objects may be
thrown and caught using this scheme. When an object is
thrown, it will be caught by the nearest @catch clause
capable of handling objects of that type, analogously to how
&quot;catch&quot; blocks work in C++ and Java. A
&quot;@catch(id ...)&quot; clause (as shown above) may also
be provided to catch any and all Objective-C exceptions not
caught by previous @catch clauses (if any).</p>

<p>The @finally clause, if present, will be executed upon
exit from the immediately preceding &quot;@try ...
@catch&quot; section. This will happen regardless of whether
any exceptions are thrown, caught or rethrown inside the
&quot;@try ... @catch&quot; section, analogously to the
behavior of the &quot;finally&quot; clause in Java.</p>

<p>There are several caveats to using the new exception
mechanism:</p>

<p>&middot; Although currently designed to be binary
compatible with &quot;NS_HANDLER&quot;-style idioms provided
by the &quot;NSException&quot; class, the new exceptions can
only be used on Mac OS X 10.3 (Panther) and later systems,
due to additional functionality needed in the (NeXT)
Objective-C runtime.</p>

<p>&middot; As mentioned above, the new exceptions do not
support handling types other than Objective-C objects.
Furthermore, when used from Objective-C++, the Objective-C
exception model does not interoperate with C++ exceptions at
this time. This means you cannot @throw an exception from
Objective-C and &quot;catch&quot; it in C++, or vice versa
(i.e., &quot;throw ... @catch&quot;).</p>

<p>The -fobjc-exceptions switch also enables the use of
synchronization blocks for thread-safe execution:</p>

<p>@synchronized (ObjCClass *guard) { ... }</p>

<p>Upon entering the @synchronized block, a thread of
execution shall first check whether a lock has been placed
on the corresponding &quot;guard&quot; object by another
thread. If it has, the current thread shall wait until the
other thread relinquishes its lock. Once &quot;guard&quot;
becomes available, the current thread will place its own
lock on it, execute the code contained in the @synchronized
block, and finally relinquish the lock (thereby making
&quot;guard&quot; available to other threads).</p>

<p>Unlike Java, Objective-C does not allow for entire
methods to be marked @synchronized. Note that throwing
exceptions out of @synchronized blocks is allowed, and will
cause the guarding object to be unlocked properly.</p>

<p>-fobjc-gc Enable garbage collection (GC) in Objective-C
and Objective-C++ programs.</p>

<p>-freplace-objc-classes Emit a special marker instructing
ld(1) not to statically link in the resulting object file,
and allow dyld(1) to load it in at run time instead. This is
used in conjunction with the Fix-and- Continue debugging
mode, where the object file in question may be recompiled
and dynamically reloaded in the course of program execution,
without the need to restart the program itself. Currently,
Fix-and-Continue functionality is only available in
conjunction with the NeXT runtime on Mac OS X 10.3 and
later.</p>

<p>-fzero-link When compiling for the NeXT runtime, the
compiler ordinarily replaces calls to
&quot;objc_getClass(&quot;...&quot;)&quot; (when the name of
the class is known at compile time) with static class
references that get initialized at load time, which improves
run-time performance. Specifying the -fzero-link flag
suppresses this behavior and causes calls to
&quot;objc_getClass(&quot;...&quot;)&quot; to be retained.
This is useful in Zero-Link debugging mode, since it allows
for individual class implementations to be modified during
program execution.</p>

<p>-gen-decls Dump interface declarations for all classes
seen in the source file to a file named sourcename.decl.</p>

<p>-Wassign-intercept (Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)
Warn whenever an Objective-C assignment is being intercepted
by the garbage collector.</p>

<p>-Wno-protocol (Objective-C and Objective-C++ only) If a
class is declared to implement a protocol, a warning is
issued for every method in the protocol that is not
implemented by the class. The default behavior is to issue a
warning for every method not explicitly implemented in the
class, even if a method implementation is inherited from the
superclass. If you use the -Wno-protocol option, then
methods inherited from the superclass are considered to be
implemented, and no warning is issued for them.</p>

<p>-Wselector (Objective-C and Objective-C++ only) Warn if
multiple methods of different types for the same selector
are found during compilation. The check is performed on the
list of methods in the final stage of compilation.
Additionally, a check is performed for each selector
appearing in a &quot;@selector(...)&quot; expression, and a
corresponding method for that selector has been found during
compilation. Because these checks scan the method table only
at the end of compilation, these warnings are not produced
if the final stage of compilation is not reached, for
example because an error is found during compilation, or
because the -fsyntax-only option is being used.</p>

<p>-Wstrict-selector-match (Objective-C and Objective-C++
only) Warn if multiple methods with differing argument
and/or return types are found for a given selector when
attempting to send a message using this selector to a
receiver of type &quot;id&quot; or &quot;Class&quot;. When
this flag is off (which is the default behavior), the
compiler will omit such warnings if any differences found
are confined to types which share the same size and
alignment.</p>

<p>-Wundeclared-selector (Objective-C and Objective-C++
only) Warn if a &quot;@selector(...)&quot; expression
referring to an undeclared selector is found. A selector is
considered undeclared if no method with that name has been
declared before the &quot;@selector(...)&quot; expression,
either explicitly in an @interface or @protocol declaration,
or implicitly in an @implementation section. This option
always performs its checks as soon as a
&quot;@selector(...)&quot; expression is found, while
-Wselector only performs its checks in the final stage of
compilation. This also enforces the coding style convention
that methods and selectors must be declared before being
used.</p>

<p>-print-objc-runtime-info Generate C header describing
the largest structure that is passed by value, if any.</p>

<p>Options to Control Diagnostic Messages Formatting
Traditionally, diagnostic messages have been formatted
irrespective of the output device s aspect (e.g. its width,
...). The options described below can be used to control the
diagnostic messages formatting algorithm, e.g. how many
characters per line, how often source location information
should be reported. Right now, only the C++ front end can
honor these options. However it is expected, in the near
future, that the remaining front ends would be able to
digest them correctly.</p>

<p>-fmessage-length=n Try to format error messages so that
they fit on lines of about n characters. The default is 72
characters for g++ and 0 for the rest of the front ends
supported by GCC. If n is zero, then no line-wrapping will
be done; each error message will appear on a single
line.</p>

<p>-fdiagnostics-show-location=once Only meaningful in
line-wrapping mode. Instructs the diagnostic messages
reporter to emit once source location information; that is,
in case the message is too long to fit on a single physical
line and has to be wrapped, the source location won t be
emitted (as prefix) again, over and over, in subsequent
continuation lines. This is the default behavior.</p>

<p>-fdiagnostics-show-location=every-line Only meaningful
in line-wrapping mode. Instructs the diagnostic messages
reporter to emit the same source location information (as
prefix) for physical lines that result from the process of
breaking a message which is too long to fit on a single
line.</p>

<p>-fdiagnostics-show-option This option instructs the
diagnostic machinery to add text to each diagnostic emitted,
which indicates which command line option directly controls
that diagnostic, when such an option is known to the
diagnostic machinery.</p>

<p>-Wcoverage-mismatch Warn if feedback profiles do not
match when using the -fprofile-use option. If a source file
was changed between -fprofile-gen and -fprofile-use, the
files with the profile feedback can fail to match the source
file and GCC can not use the profile feedback information.
By default, GCC emits an error message in this case. The
option -Wcoverage-mismatch emits a warning instead of an
error. GCC does not use appropriate feedback profiles, so
using this option can result in poorly optimized code. This
option is useful only in the case of very minor changes such
as bug fixes to an existing code-base.</p>

<p>Options to Request or Suppress Warnings Warnings are
diagnostic messages that report constructions which are not
inherently erroneous but which are risky or suggest there
may have been an error.</p>

<p>The following language-independent options do not enable
specific warnings but control the kinds of diagnostics
produced by GCC.</p>

<p>-fsyntax-only Check the code for syntax errors, but dont
do anything beyond that.</p>

<p>-w Inhibit all warning messages.</p>

<p>-Werror Make all warnings into errors.</p>

<p>-Werror= Make the specified warning into an error. The
specifier for a warning is appended, for example
-Werror=switch turns the warnings controlled by -Wswitch
into errors. This switch takes a negative form, to be used
to negate -Werror for specific warnings, for example
-Wno-error=switch makes -Wswitch warnings not be errors,
even when -Werror is in effect. You can use the
-fdiagnostics-show-option option to have each controllable
warning amended with the option which controls it, to
determine what to use with this option.</p>

<p>Note that specifying -Werror=foo automatically implies
-Wfoo. However, -Wno-error=foo does not imply anything.</p>

<p>-Wfatal-errors This option causes the compiler to abort
compilation on the first error occurred rather than trying
to keep going and printing further error messages.</p>

<p>You can request many specific warnings with options
beginning -W, for example -Wimplicit to request warnings on
implicit declarations. Each of these specific warning
options also has a negative form beginning -Wno- to turn off
warnings; for example, -Wno-implicit. This manual lists only
one of the two forms, whichever is not the default. For
further, language-specific options also refer to C++ Dialect
Options and Objective-C and Objective-C++ Dialect
Options.</p>

<p>-pedantic Issue all the warnings demanded by strict ISO
C and ISO C++; reject all programs that use forbidden
extensions, and some other programs that do not follow ISO C
and ISO C++. For ISO C, follows the version of the ISO C
standard specified by any -std option used.</p>

<p>Valid ISO C and ISO C++ programs should compile properly
with or without this option (though a rare few will require
-ansi or a -std option specifying the required version of
ISO C). However, without this option, certain GNU extensions
and traditional C and C++ features are supported as well.
With this option, they are rejected.</p>

<p>-pedantic does not cause warning messages for use of the
alternate keywords whose names begin and end with __.
Pedantic warnings are also disabled in the expression that
follows &quot;__extension__&quot;. However, only system
header files should use these escape routes; application
programs should avoid them.</p>

<p>Some users try to use -pedantic to check programs for
strict ISO C conformance. They soon find that it does not do
quite what they want: it finds some non-ISO practices, but
not all---only those for which ISO C requires a diagnostic,
and some others for which diagnostics have been added.</p>

<p>A feature to report any failure to conform to ISO C
might be useful in some instances, but would require
considerable additional work and would be quite different
from -pedantic. We dont have plans to support such a feature
in the near future.</p>

<p>Where the standard specified with -std represents a GNU
extended dialect of C, such as gnu89 or gnu99, there is a
corresponding base standard, the version of ISO C on which
the GNU extended dialect is based. Warnings from -pedantic
are given where they are required by the base standard. (It
would not make sense for such warnings to be given only for
features not in the specified GNU C dialect, since by
definition the GNU dialects of C include all features the
compiler supports with the given option, and there would be
nothing to warn about.)</p>

<p>-pedantic-errors Like -pedantic, except that errors are
produced rather than warnings.</p>

<p>-Wall This enables all the warnings about constructions
that some users consider questionable, and that are easy to
avoid (or modify to prevent the warning), even in
conjunction with macros. This also enables some
language-specific warnings described in C++ Dialect Options
and Objective-C and Objective-C++ Dialect Options.</p>

<p>-Wall turns on the following warning flags:</p>

<p>-Waddress -Warray-bounds (only with -O2) -Wc++0x-compat
-Wchar-subscripts -Wimplicit-int
-Wimplicit-function-declaration -Wcomment -Wformat -Wmain
(only for C/ObjC and unless -ffreestanding) -Wmissing-braces
-Wnonnull -Wparentheses -Wpointer-sign -Wreorder
-Wreturn-type -Wsequence-point -Wsign-compare (only in C++)
-Wstrict-aliasing -Wstrict-overflow=1 -Wswitch -Wtrigraphs
-Wuninitialized -Wunknown-pragmas -Wunused-function
-Wunused-label -Wunused-value -Wunused-variable
-Wvolatile-register-var</p>

<p>Note that some warning flags are not implied by -Wall.
Some of them warn about constructions that users generally
do not consider questionable, but which occasionally you
might wish to check for; others warn about constructions
that are necessary or hard to avoid in some cases, and there
is no simple way to modify the code to suppress the warning.
Some of them are enabled by -Wextra but many of them must be
enabled individually.</p>

<p>-Wextra This enables some extra warning flags that are
not enabled by -Wall. (This option used to be called -W. The
older name is still supported, but the newer name is more
descriptive.)</p>

<p>-Wclobbered -Wempty-body -Wignored-qualifiers
-Wmissing-field-initializers -Wmissing-parameter-type (C
only) -Wold-style-declaration (C only) -Woverride-init
-Wsign-compare -Wtype-limits -Wuninitialized
-Wunused-parameter (only with -Wunused or -Wall)</p>

<p>The option -Wextra also prints warning messages for the
following cases:</p>

<p>&middot; A pointer is compared against integer zero with
&lt;, &lt;=, &gt;, or &gt;=.</p>

<p>&middot; (C++ only) An enumerator and a non-enumerator
both appear in a conditional expression.</p>

<p>&middot; (C++ only) Ambiguous virtual bases.</p>

<p>&middot; (C++ only) Subscripting an array which has been
declared register.</p>

<p>&middot; (C++ only) Taking the address of a variable
which has been declared register.</p>

<p>&middot; (C++ only) A base class is not initialized in a
derived class copy constructor.</p>

<p>-Wchar-subscripts Warn if an array subscript has type
&quot;char&quot;. This is a common cause of error, as
programmers often forget that this type is signed on some
machines. This warning is enabled by -Wall.</p>

<p>-Wcomment Warn whenever a comment-start sequence /*
appears in a /* comment, or whenever a Backslash-Newline
appears in a // comment. This warning is enabled by
-Wall.</p>

<p>-Wformat Check calls to &quot;printf&quot; and
&quot;scanf&quot;, etc., to make sure that the arguments
supplied have types appropriate to the format string
specified, and that the conversions specified in the format
string make sense. This includes standard functions, and
others specified by format attributes, in the
&quot;printf&quot;, &quot;scanf&quot;, &quot;strftime&quot;
and &quot;strfmon&quot; (an X/Open extension, not in the C
standard) families (or other target-specific families).
Which functions are checked without format attributes having
been specified depends on the standard version selected, and
such checks of functions without the attribute specified are
disabled by -ffreestanding or -fno-builtin.</p>

<p>The formats are checked against the format features
supported by GNU libc version 2.2. These include all ISO C90
and C99 features, as well as features from the Single Unix
Specification and some BSD and GNU extensions. Other library
implementations may not support all these features; GCC does
not support warning about features that go beyond a
particular librarys limitations. However, if -pedantic is
used with -Wformat, warnings will be given about format
features not in the selected standard version (but not for
&quot;strfmon&quot; formats, since those are not in any
version of the C standard).</p>

<p>Since -Wformat also checks for null format arguments for
several functions, -Wformat also implies -Wnonnull.</p>

<p>-Wformat is included in -Wall. For more control over
some aspects of format checking, the options -Wformat-y2k,
-Wno-format-extra-args, -Wno-format-zero-length,
-Wformat-nonliteral, -Wformat-security, and -Wformat=2 are
available, but are not included in -Wall.</p>

<p>-Wformat-y2k If -Wformat is specified, also warn about
&quot;strftime&quot; formats which may yield only a
two-digit year.</p>

<p>-Wno-format-contains-nul If -Wformat is specified, do
not warn about format strings that contain NUL bytes.</p>

<p>-Wno-format-extra-args If -Wformat is specified, do not
warn about excess arguments to a &quot;printf&quot; or
&quot;scanf&quot; format function. The C standard specifies
that such arguments are ignored.</p>

<p>Where the unused arguments lie between used arguments
that are specified with $ operand number specifications,
normally warnings are still given, since the implementation
could not know what type to pass to &quot;va_arg&quot; to
skip the unused arguments. However, in the case of
&quot;scanf&quot; formats, this option will suppress the
warning if the unused arguments are all pointers, since the
Single Unix Specification says that such unused arguments
are allowed.</p>

<p>-Wno-format-zero-length (C and Objective-C only) If
-Wformat is specified, do not warn about zero-length
formats. The C standard specifies that zero-length formats
are allowed.</p>

<p>-Wformat-nonliteral If -Wformat is specified, also warn
if the format string is not a string literal and so cannot
be checked, unless the format function takes its format
arguments as a &quot;va_list&quot;.</p>

<p>-Wformat-security If -Wformat is specified, also warn
about uses of format functions that represent possible
security problems. At present, this warns about calls to
&quot;printf&quot; and &quot;scanf&quot; functions where the
format string is not a string literal and there are no
format arguments, as in &quot;printf (foo);&quot;. This may
be a security hole if the format string came from untrusted
input and contains %n. (This is currently a subset of what
-Wformat-nonliteral warns about, but in future warnings may
be added to -Wformat-security that are not included in
-Wformat-nonliteral.)</p>

<p>-Wformat=2 Enable -Wformat plus format checks not
included in -Wformat. Currently equivalent to -Wformat
-Wformat-nonliteral -Wformat-security -Wformat-y2k.</p>

<p>-Wnonnull (C and Objective-C only) Warn about passing a
null pointer for arguments marked as requiring a non-null
value by the &quot;nonnull&quot; function attribute.</p>

<p>-Wnonnull is included in -Wall and -Wformat. It can be
disabled with the -Wno-nonnull option.</p>

<p>-Winit-self (C, C++, Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)
Warn about uninitialized variables which are initialized
with themselves. Note this option can only be used with the
-Wuninitialized option.</p>

<p>For example, GCC will warn about &quot;i&quot; being
uninitialized in the following snippet only when -Winit-self
has been specified:</p>

<p>int f() { int i = i; return i; }</p>

<p>-Wimplicit-int (C and Objective-C only) Warn when a
declaration does not specify a type. This warning is enabled
by -Wall.</p>

<p>-Wimplicit-function-declaration (C and Objective-C only)
Give a warning whenever a function is used before being
declared. In C99 mode (-std=c99 or -std=gnu99), this warning
is enabled by default and it is made into an error by
-pedantic-errors. This warning is also enabled by -Wall.</p>

<p>-Wimplicit Same as -Wimplicit-int and
-Wimplicit-function-declaration. This warning is enabled by
-Wall.</p>

<p>-Wignored-qualifiers (C and C++ only) Warn if the return
type of a function has a type qualifier such as
&quot;const&quot;. For ISO C such a type qualifier has no
effect, since the value returned by a function is not an
lvalue. For C++, the warning is only emitted for scalar
types or &quot;void&quot;. ISO C prohibits qualified
&quot;void&quot; return types on function definitions, so
such return types always receive a warning even without this
option.</p>

<p>This warning is also enabled by -Wextra.</p>

<p>-Wmain Warn if the type of main is suspicious. main
should be a function with external linkage, returning int,
taking either zero arguments, two, or three arguments of
appropriate types. This warning is enabled by default in C++
and is enabled by either -Wall or -pedantic.</p>

<p>-Wmissing-braces Warn if an aggregate or union
initializer is not fully bracketed. In the following
example, the initializer for a is not fully bracketed, but
that for b is fully bracketed.</p>

<p>int a[2][2] = { 0, 1, 2, 3 }; int b[2][2] = { { 0, 1 },
{ 2, 3 } };</p>

<p>This warning is enabled by -Wall.</p>

<p>-Wmissing-include-dirs (C, C++, Objective-C and
Objective-C++ only) Warn if a user-supplied include
directory does not exist.</p>

<p>-Wparentheses Warn if parentheses are omitted in certain
contexts, such as when there is an assignment in a context
where a truth value is expected, or when operators are
nested whose precedence people often get confused about.</p>

<p>Also warn if a comparison like x&lt;=y&lt;=z appears;
this is equivalent to (x&lt;=y ? 1 : 0) &lt;= z, which is a
different interpretation from that of ordinary mathematical
notation.</p>

<p>Also warn about constructions where there may be
confusion to which &quot;if&quot; statement an
&quot;else&quot; branch belongs. Here is an example of such
a case:</p>

<p>{ if (a) if (b) foo (); else bar (); }</p>

<p>In C/C++, every &quot;else&quot; branch belongs to the
innermost possible &quot;if&quot; statement, which in this
example is &quot;if (b)&quot;. This is often not what the
programmer expected, as illustrated in the above example by
indentation the programmer chose. When there is the
potential for this confusion, GCC will issue a warning when
this flag is specified. To eliminate the warning, add
explicit braces around the innermost &quot;if&quot;
statement so there is no way the &quot;else&quot; could
belong to the enclosing &quot;if&quot;. The resulting code
would look like this:</p>

<p>{ if (a) { if (b) foo (); else bar (); } }</p>

<p>This warning is enabled by -Wall.</p>

<p>-Wsequence-point Warn about code that may have undefined
semantics because of violations of sequence point rules in
the C and C++ standards.</p>

<p>The C and C++ standards defines the order in which
expressions in a C/C++ program are evaluated in terms of
sequence points, which represent a partial ordering between
the execution of parts of the program: those executed before
the sequence point, and those executed after it. These occur
after the evaluation of a full expression (one which is not
part of a larger expression), after the evaluation of the
first operand of a &quot;&amp;&amp;&quot;, &quot;||&quot;,
&quot;? :&quot; or &quot;,&quot; (comma) operator, before a
function is called (but after the evaluation of its
arguments and the expression denoting the called function),
and in certain other places. Other than as expressed by the
sequence point rules, the order of evaluation of
subexpressions of an expression is not specified. All these
rules describe only a partial order rather than a total
order, since, for example, if two functions are called
within one expression with no sequence point between them,
the order in which the functions are called is not
specified. However, the standards committee have ruled that
function calls do not overlap.</p>

<p>It is not specified when between sequence points
modifications to the values of objects take effect. Programs
whose behavior depends on this have undefined behavior; the
C and C++ standards specify that &quot;Between the previous
and next sequence point an object shall have its stored
value modified at most once by the evaluation of an
expression. Furthermore, the prior value shall be read only
to determine the value to be stored.&quot;. If a program
breaks these rules, the results on any particular
implementation are entirely unpredictable.</p>

<p>Examples of code with undefined behavior are &quot;a =
a++;&quot;, &quot;a[n] = b[n++]&quot; and &quot;a[i++] =
i;&quot;. Some more complicated cases are not diagnosed by
this option, and it may give an occasional false positive
result, but in general it has been found fairly effective at
detecting this sort of problem in programs.</p>

<p>The standard is worded confusingly, therefore there is
some debate over the precise meaning of the sequence point
rules in subtle cases. Links to discussions of the problem,
including proposed formal definitions, may be found on the
GCC readings page, at
&lt;http://gcc.gnu.org/readings.html&gt;.</p>

<p>This warning is enabled by -Wall for C and C++.</p>

<p>-Wreturn-type Warn whenever a function is defined with a
return-type that defaults to &quot;int&quot;. Also warn
about any &quot;return&quot; statement with no return-value
in a function whose return-type is not &quot;void&quot;
(falling off the end of the function body is considered
returning without a value), and about a &quot;return&quot;
statement with a expression in a function whose return-type
is &quot;void&quot;.</p>

<p>For C++, a function without return type always produces
a diagnostic message, even when -Wno-return-type is
specified. The only exceptions are main and functions
defined in system headers.</p>

<p>This warning is enabled by -Wall.</p>

<p>-Wswitch Warn whenever a &quot;switch&quot; statement
has an index of enumerated type and lacks a &quot;case&quot;
for one or more of the named codes of that enumeration. (The
presence of a &quot;default&quot; label prevents this
warning.) &quot;case&quot; labels outside the enumeration
range also provoke warnings when this option is used. This
warning is enabled by -Wall.</p>

<p>-Wswitch-default Warn whenever a &quot;switch&quot;
statement does not have a &quot;default&quot; case.</p>

<p>-Wswitch-enum Warn whenever a &quot;switch&quot;
statement has an index of enumerated type and lacks a
&quot;case&quot; for one or more of the named codes of that
enumeration. &quot;case&quot; labels outside the enumeration
range also provoke warnings when this option is used.</p>

<p>-Wsync-nand (C and C++ only) Warn when
&quot;__sync_fetch_and_nand&quot; and
&quot;__sync_nand_and_fetch&quot; built-in functions are
used. These functions changed semantics in GCC 4.4.</p>

<p>-Wtrigraphs Warn if any trigraphs are encountered that
might change the meaning of the program (trigraphs within
comments are not warned about). This warning is enabled by
-Wall.</p>

<p>-Wunused-but-set-parameter Warn whenever a function
parameter is assigned to, but otherwise unused (aside from
its declaration).</p>

<p>To suppress this warning use the unused attribute.</p>

<p>-Wunused-but-set-variable Warn whenever a local variable
is assigned to, but otherwise unused (aside from its
declaration).</p>

<p>To suppress this warning use the unused attribute.</p>

<p>-Wunused-function Warn whenever a static function is
declared but not defined or a non-inline static function is
unused. This warning is enabled by -Wall.</p>

<p>-Wunused-label Warn whenever a label is declared but not
used. This warning is enabled by -Wall.</p>

<p>To suppress this warning use the unused attribute.</p>

<p>-Wunused-parameter Warn whenever a function parameter is
unused aside from its declaration.</p>

<p>To suppress this warning use the unused attribute.</p>

<p>-Wunused-variable Warn whenever a local variable or
non-constant static variable is unused aside from its
declaration. This warning is enabled by -Wall.</p>

<p>To suppress this warning use the unused attribute.</p>

<p>-Wunused-value Warn whenever a statement computes a
result that is explicitly not used. To suppress this warning
cast the unused expression to void. This includes an
expression-statement or the left-hand side of a comma
expression that contains no side effects. For example, an
expression such as x[i,j] will cause a warning, while
x[(void)i,j] will not.</p>

<p>This warning is enabled by -Wall.</p>

<p>-Wunused All the above -Wunused options combined.</p>

<p>In order to get a warning about an unused function
parameter, you must either specify -Wextra -Wunused (note
that -Wall implies -Wunused), or separately specify
-Wunused-parameter.</p>

<p>-Wuninitialized Warn if an automatic variable is used
without first being initialized or if a variable may be
clobbered by a &quot;setjmp&quot; call. In C++, warn if a
non-static reference or non-static const member appears in a
class without constructors.</p>

<p>If you want to warn about code which uses the
uninitialized value of the variable in its own initializer,
use the -Winit-self option.</p>

<p>These warnings occur for individual uninitialized or
clobbered elements of structure, union or array variables as
well as for variables which are uninitialized or clobbered
as a whole. They do not occur for variables or elements
declared &quot;volatile&quot;. Because these warnings depend
on optimization, the exact variables or elements for which
there are warnings will depend on the precise optimization
options and version of GCC used.</p>

<p>Note that there may be no warning about a variable that
is used only to compute a value that itself is never used,
because such computations may be deleted by data flow
analysis before the warnings are printed.</p>

<p>These warnings are made optional because GCC is not
smart enough to see all the reasons why the code might be
correct despite appearing to have an error. Here is one
example of how this can happen:</p>

<p>{ int x; switch (y) { case 1: x = 1; break; case 2: x =
4; break; case 3: x = 5; } foo (x); }</p>

<p>If the value of &quot;y&quot; is always 1, 2 or 3, then
&quot;x&quot; is always initialized, but GCC doesn t know
this. Here is another common case:</p>

<p>{ int save_y; if (change_y) save_y = y, y = new_y; ...
if (change_y) y = save_y; }</p>

<p>This has no bug because &quot;save_y&quot; is used only
if it is set.</p>

<p>This option also warns when a non-volatile automatic
variable might be changed by a call to &quot;longjmp&quot;.
These warnings as well are possible only in optimizing
compilation.</p>

<p>The compiler sees only the calls to &quot;setjmp&quot;.
It cannot know where &quot;longjmp&quot; will be called; in
fact, a signal handler could call it at any point in the
code. As a result, you may get a warning even when there is
in fact no problem because &quot;longjmp&quot; cannot in
fact be called at the place which would cause a problem.</p>

<p>Some spurious warnings can be avoided if you declare all
the functions you use that never return as
&quot;noreturn&quot;.</p>

<p>This warning is enabled by -Wall or -Wextra.</p>

<p>-Wunknown-pragmas Warn when a #pragma directive is
encountered which is not understood by GCC. If this command
line option is used, warnings will even be issued for
unknown pragmas in system header files. This is not the case
if the warnings were only enabled by the -Wall command line
option.</p>

<p>-Wno-pragmas Do not warn about misuses of pragmas, such
as incorrect parameters, invalid syntax, or conflicts
between pragmas. See also -Wunknown-pragmas.</p>

<p>-Wstrict-aliasing This option is only active when
-fstrict-aliasing is active. It warns about code which might
break the strict aliasing rules that the compiler is using
for optimization. The warning does not catch all cases, but
does attempt to catch the more common pitfalls. It is
included in -Wall. It is equivalent to
-Wstrict-aliasing=3</p>

<p>-Wstrict-aliasing=n This option is only active when
-fstrict-aliasing is active. It warns about code which might
break the strict aliasing rules that the compiler is using
for optimization. Higher levels correspond to higher
accuracy (fewer false positives). Higher levels also
correspond to more effort, similar to the way -O works.
-Wstrict-aliasing is equivalent to -Wstrict-aliasing=n, with
n=3.</p>

<p>Level 1: Most aggressive, quick, least accurate.
Possibly useful when higher levels do not warn but
-fstrict-aliasing still breaks the code, as it has very few
false negatives. However, it has many false positives. Warns
for all pointer conversions between possibly incompatible
types, even if never dereferenced. Runs in the frontend
only.</p>

<p>Level 2: Aggressive, quick, not too precise. May still
have many false positives (not as many as level 1 though),
and few false negatives (but possibly more than level 1).
Unlike level 1, it only warns when an address is taken.
Warns about incomplete types. Runs in the frontend only.</p>

<p>Level 3 (default for -Wstrict-aliasing): Should have
very few false positives and few false negatives. Slightly
slower than levels 1 or 2 when optimization is enabled.
Takes care of the common punn+dereference pattern in the
frontend: &quot;*(int*)&amp;some_float&quot;. If
optimization is enabled, it also runs in the backend, where
it deals with multiple statement cases using flow-sensitive
points-to information. Only warns when the converted pointer
is dereferenced. Does not warn about incomplete types.</p>

<p>-Wstrict-overflow -Wstrict-overflow=n This option is
only active when -fstrict-overflow is active. It warns about
cases where the compiler optimizes based on the assumption
that signed overflow does not occur. Note that it does not
warn about all cases where the code might overflow: it only
warns about cases where the compiler implements some
optimization. Thus this warning depends on the optimization
level.</p>

<p>An optimization which assumes that signed overflow does
not occur is perfectly safe if the values of the variables
involved are such that overflow never does, in fact, occur.
Therefore this warning can easily give a false positive: a
warning about code which is not actually a problem. To help
focus on important issues, several warning levels are
defined. No warnings are issued for the use of undefined
signed overflow when estimating how many iterations a loop
will require, in particular when determining whether a loop
will be executed at all.</p>

<p>-Wstrict-overflow=1 Warn about cases which are both
questionable and easy to avoid. For example: &quot;x + 1
&gt; x&quot;; with -fstrict-overflow, the compiler will
simplify this to 1. This level of -Wstrict-overflow is
enabled by -Wall; higher levels are not, and must be
explicitly requested.</p>

<p>-Wstrict-overflow=2 Also warn about other cases where a
comparison is simplified to a constant. For example:
&quot;abs (x) &gt;= 0&quot;. This can only be simplified
when -fstrict-overflow is in effect, because &quot;abs
(INT_MIN)&quot; overflows to &quot;INT_MIN&quot;, which is
less than zero. -Wstrict-overflow (with no level) is the
same as -Wstrict-overflow=2.</p>

<p>-Wstrict-overflow=3 Also warn about other cases where a
comparison is simplified. For example: &quot;x + 1 &gt;
1&quot; will be simplified to &quot;x &gt; 0&quot;.</p>

<p>-Wstrict-overflow=4 Also warn about other
simplifications not covered by the above cases. For example:
&quot;(x * 10) / 5&quot; will be simplified to &quot;x *
2&quot;.</p>

<p>-Wstrict-overflow=5 Also warn about cases where the
compiler reduces the magnitude of a constant involved in a
comparison. For example: &quot;x + 2 &gt; y&quot; will be
simplified to &quot;x + 1 &gt;= y&quot;. This is reported
only at the highest warning level because this
simplification applies to many comparisons, so this warning
level will give a very large number of false positives.</p>

<p>-Warray-bounds This option is only active when
-ftree-vrp is active (default for -O2 and above). It warns
about subscripts to arrays that are always out of bounds.
This warning is enabled by -Wall.</p>

<p>-Wno-div-by-zero Do not warn about compile-time integer
division by zero. Floating point division by zero is not
warned about, as it can be a legitimate way of obtaining
infinities and NaNs.</p>

<p>-Wsystem-headers Print warning messages for constructs
found in system header files. Warnings from system headers
are normally suppressed, on the assumption that they usually
do not indicate real problems and would only make the
compiler output harder to read. Using this command line
option tells GCC to emit warnings from system headers as if
they occurred in user code. However, note that using -Wall
in conjunction with this option will not warn about unknown
pragmas in system headers---for that, -Wunknown-pragmas must
also be used.</p>

<p>-Wfloat-equal Warn if floating point values are used in
equality comparisons.</p>

<p>The idea behind this is that sometimes it is convenient
(for the programmer) to consider floating-point values as
approximations to infinitely precise real numbers. If you
are doing this, then you need to compute (by analyzing the
code, or in some other way) the maximum or likely maximum
error that the computation introduces, and allow for it when
performing comparisons (and when producing output, but that
s a different problem). In particular, instead of testing
for equality, you would check to see whether the two values
have ranges that overlap; and this is done with the
relational operators, so equality comparisons are probably
mistaken.</p>

<p>-Wtraditional (C and Objective-C only) Warn about
certain constructs that behave differently in traditional
and ISO C. Also warn about ISO C constructs that have no
traditional C equivalent, and/or problematic constructs
which should be avoided.</p>

<p>&middot; Macro parameters that appear within string
literals in the macro body. In traditional C macro
replacement takes place within string literals, but does not
in ISO C.</p>

<p>&middot; In traditional C, some preprocessor directives
did not exist. Traditional preprocessors would only consider
a line to be a directive if the # appeared in column 1 on
the line. Therefore -Wtraditional warns about directives
that traditional C understands but would ignore because the
# does not appear as the first character on the line. It
also suggests you hide directives like #pragma not
understood by traditional C by indenting them. Some
traditional implementations would not recognize #elif, so it
suggests avoiding it altogether.</p>

<p>&middot; A function-like macro that appears without
arguments.</p>

<p>&middot; The unary plus operator.</p>

<p>&middot; The U integer constant suffix, or the F or L
floating point constant suffixes. (Traditional C does
support the L suffix on integer constants.) Note, these
suffixes appear in macros defined in the system headers of
most modern systems, e.g. the _MIN/_MAX macros in
&quot;&lt;limits.h&gt;&quot;. Use of these macros in user
code might normally lead to spurious warnings, however GCCs
integrated preprocessor has enough context to avoid warning
in these cases.</p>

<p>&middot; A function declared external in one block and
then used after the end of the block.</p>

<p>&middot; A &quot;switch&quot; statement has an operand
of type &quot;long&quot;.</p>

<p>&middot; A non-&quot;static&quot; function declaration
follows a &quot;static&quot; one. This construct is not
accepted by some traditional C compilers.</p>

<p>&middot; The ISO type of an integer constant has a
different width or signedness from its traditional type.
This warning is only issued if the base of the constant is
ten. I.e. hexadecimal or octal values, which typically
represent bit patterns, are not warned about.</p>

<p>&middot; Usage of ISO string concatenation is
detected.</p>

<p>&middot; Initialization of automatic aggregates.</p>

<p>&middot; Identifier conflicts with labels. Traditional C
lacks a separate namespace for labels.</p>

<p>&middot; Initialization of unions. If the initializer is
zero, the warning is omitted. This is done under the
assumption that the zero initializer in user code appears
conditioned on e.g. &quot;__STDC__&quot; to avoid missing
initializer warnings and relies on default initialization to
zero in the traditional C case.</p>

<p>&middot; Conversions by prototypes between
fixed/floating point values and vice versa. The absence of
these prototypes when compiling with traditional C would
cause serious problems. This is a subset of the possible
conversion warnings, for the full set use
-Wtraditional-conversion.</p>

<p>&middot; Use of ISO C style function definitions. This
warning intentionally is not issued for prototype
declarations or variadic functions because these ISO C
features will appear in your code when using libiberty s
traditional C compatibility macros, &quot;PARAMS&quot; and
&quot;VPARAMS&quot;. This warning is also bypassed for
nested functions because that feature is already a GCC
extension and thus not relevant to traditional C
compatibility.</p>

<p>-Wtraditional-conversion (C and Objective-C only) Warn
if a prototype causes a type conversion that is different
from what would happen to the same argument in the absence
of a prototype. This includes conversions of fixed point to
floating and vice versa, and conversions changing the width
or signedness of a fixed point argument except when the same
as the default promotion.</p>

<p>-Wdeclaration-after-statement (C and Objective-C only)
Warn when a declaration is found after a statement in a
block. This construct, known from C++, was introduced with
ISO C99 and is by default allowed in GCC. It is not
supported by ISO C90 and was not supported by GCC versions
before GCC 3.0.</p>

<p>-Wundef Warn if an undefined identifier is evaluated in
an #if directive.</p>

<p>-Wno-endif-labels Do not warn whenever an #else or an
#endif are followed by text.</p>

<p>-Wshadow Warn whenever a local variable shadows another
local variable, parameter or global variable or whenever a
built-in function is shadowed.</p>

<p>-Wlarger-than=len Warn whenever an object of larger than
len bytes is defined.</p>

<p>-Wframe-larger-than=len Warn if the size of a function
frame is larger than len bytes. The computation done to
determine the stack frame size is approximate and not
conservative. The actual requirements may be somewhat
greater than len even if you do not get a warning. In
addition, any space allocated via &quot;alloca&quot;,
variable-length arrays, or related constructs is not
included by the compiler when determining whether or not to
issue a warning.</p>

<p>-Wunsafe-loop-optimizations Warn if the loop cannot be
optimized because the compiler could not assume anything on
the bounds of the loop indices. With
-funsafe-loop-optimizations warn if the compiler made such
assumptions.</p>

<p>-Wno-pedantic-ms-format (MinGW targets only) Disables
the warnings about non-ISO &quot;printf&quot; /
&quot;scanf&quot; format width specifiers &quot;I32&quot;,
&quot;I64&quot;, and &quot;I&quot; used on Windows targets
depending on the MS runtime, when you are using the options
-Wformat and -pedantic without gnu-extensions.</p>

<p>-Wpointer-arith Warn about anything that depends on the
&quot;size of&quot; a function type or of &quot;void&quot;.
GNU C assigns these types a size of 1, for convenience in
calculations with &quot;void *&quot; pointers and pointers
to functions. In C++, warn also when an arithmetic operation
involves &quot;NULL&quot;. This warning is also enabled by
-pedantic.</p>

<p>-Wtype-limits Warn if a comparison is always true or
always false due to the limited range of the data type, but
do not warn for constant expressions. For example, warn if
an unsigned variable is compared against zero with &lt; or
&gt;=. This warning is also enabled by -Wextra.</p>

<p>-Wbad-function-cast (C and Objective-C only) Warn
whenever a function call is cast to a non-matching type. For
example, warn if &quot;int malloc()&quot; is cast to
&quot;anything *&quot;.</p>

<p>-Wc++-compat (C and Objective-C only) Warn about ISO C
constructs that are outside of the common subset of ISO C
and ISO C++, e.g. request for implicit conversion from
&quot;void *&quot; to a pointer to non-&quot;void&quot;
type.</p>

<p>-Wc++0x-compat (C++ and Objective-C++ only) Warn about
C++ constructs whose meaning differs between ISO C++ 1998
and ISO C++ 200x, e.g., identifiers in ISO C++ 1998 that
will become keywords in ISO C++ 200x. This warning is
enabled by -Wall.</p>

<p>-Wcast-qual Warn whenever a pointer is cast so as to
remove a type qualifier from the target type. For example,
warn if a &quot;const char *&quot; is cast to an ordinary
&quot;char *&quot;.</p>

<p>-Wcast-align Warn whenever a pointer is cast such that
the required alignment of the target is increased. For
example, warn if a &quot;char *&quot; is cast to an
&quot;int *&quot; on machines where integers can only be
accessed at two- or four-byte boundaries.</p>

<p>-Wwrite-strings When compiling C, give string constants
the type &quot;const char[length]&quot; so that copying the
address of one into a non-&quot;const&quot; &quot;char
*&quot; pointer will get a warning. These warnings will help
you find at compile time code that can try to write into a
string constant, but only if you have been very careful
about using &quot;const&quot; in declarations and
prototypes. Otherwise, it will just be a nuisance. This is
why we did not make -Wall request these warnings.</p>

<p>When compiling C++, warn about the deprecated conversion
from string literals to &quot;char *&quot;. This warning is
enabled by default for C++ programs.</p>

<p>-Wclobbered Warn for variables that might be changed by
longjmp or vfork. This warning is also enabled by
-Wextra.</p>

<p>-Wconversion Warn for implicit conversions that may
alter a value. This includes conversions between real and
integer, like &quot;abs (x)&quot; when &quot;x&quot; is
&quot;double&quot;; conversions between signed and unsigned,
like &quot;unsigned ui = -1&quot;; and conversions to
smaller types, like &quot;sqrtf (M_PI)&quot;. Do not warn
for explicit casts like &quot;abs ((int) x)&quot; and
&quot;ui = (unsigned) -1&quot;, or if the value is not
changed by the conversion like in &quot;abs (2.0)&quot;.
Warnings about conversions between signed and unsigned
integers can be disabled by using -Wno-sign-conversion.</p>

<p>For C++, also warn for conversions between
&quot;NULL&quot; and non-pointer types; confusing overload
resolution for user-defined conversions; and conversions
that will never use a type conversion operator: conversions
to &quot;void&quot;, the same type, a base class or a
reference to them. Warnings about conversions between signed
and unsigned integers are disabled by default in C++ unless
-Wsign-conversion is explicitly enabled.</p>

<p>-Wempty-body Warn if an empty body occurs in an if, else
or do while statement. This warning is also enabled by
-Wextra.</p>

<p>-Wenum-compare (C++ and Objective-C++ only) Warn about a
comparison between values of different enum types. This
warning is enabled by default.</p>

<p>-Wsign-compare Warn when a comparison between signed and
unsigned values could produce an incorrect result when the
signed value is converted to unsigned. This warning is also
enabled by -Wextra; to get the other warnings of -Wextra
without this warning, use -Wextra -Wno-sign-compare.</p>

<p>-Wsign-conversion Warn for implicit conversions that may
change the sign of an integer value, like assigning a signed
integer expression to an unsigned integer variable. An
explicit cast silences the warning. In C, this option is
enabled also by -Wconversion.</p>

<p>-Waddress Warn about suspicious uses of memory
addresses. These include using the address of a function in
a conditional expression, such as &quot;void func(void); if
(func)&quot;, and comparisons against the memory address of
a string literal, such as &quot;if (x ==
&quot;abc&quot;)&quot;. Such uses typically indicate a
programmer error: the address of a function always evaluates
to true, so their use in a conditional usually indicate that
the programmer forgot the parentheses in a function call;
and comparisons against string literals result in
unspecified behavior and are not portable in C, so they
usually indicate that the programmer intended to use
&quot;strcmp&quot;. This warning is enabled by -Wall.</p>

<p>-Wlogical-op Warn about suspicious uses of logical
operators in expressions. This includes using logical
operators in contexts where a bit-wise operator is likely to
be expected.</p>

<p>-Waggregate-return Warn if any functions that return
structures or unions are defined or called. (In languages
where you can return an array, this also elicits a
warning.)</p>

<p>-Wno-attributes Do not warn if an unexpected
&quot;__attribute__&quot; is used, such as unrecognized
attributes, function attributes applied to variables, etc.
This will not stop errors for incorrect use of supported
attributes.</p>

<p>-Wno-builtin-macro-redefined Do not warn if certain
built-in macros are redefined. This suppresses warnings for
redefinition of &quot;__TIMESTAMP__&quot;,
&quot;__TIME__&quot;, &quot;__DATE__&quot;,
&quot;__FILE__&quot;, and &quot;__BASE_FILE__&quot;.</p>

<p>-Wstrict-prototypes (C and Objective-C only) Warn if a
function is declared or defined without specifying the
argument types. (An old-style function definition is
permitted without a warning if preceded by a declaration
which specifies the argument types.)</p>

<p>-Wold-style-declaration (C and Objective-C only) Warn
for obsolescent usages, according to the C Standard, in a
declaration. For example, warn if storage-class specifiers
like &quot;static&quot; are not the first things in a
declaration. This warning is also enabled by -Wextra.</p>

<p>-Wold-style-definition (C and Objective-C only) Warn if
an old-style function definition is used. A warning is given
even if there is a previous prototype.</p>

<p>-Wmissing-parameter-type (C and Objective-C only) A
function parameter is declared without a type specifier in
K&amp;R-style functions:</p>

<p>void foo(bar) { }</p>

<p>This warning is also enabled by -Wextra.</p>

<p>-Wmissing-prototypes (C and Objective-C only) Warn if a
global function is defined without a previous prototype
declaration. This warning is issued even if the definition
itself provides a prototype. The aim is to detect global
functions that fail to be declared in header files.</p>

<p>-Wmissing-declarations Warn if a global function is
defined without a previous declaration. Do so even if the
definition itself provides a prototype. Use this option to
detect global functions that are not declared in header
files. In C++, no warnings are issued for function
templates, or for inline functions, or for functions in
anonymous namespaces.</p>

<p>-Wmissing-field-initializers Warn if a structure s
initializer has some fields missing. For example, the
following code would cause such a warning, because
&quot;x.h&quot; is implicitly zero:</p>

<p>struct s { int f, g, h; }; struct s x = { 3, 4 };</p>

<p>This option does not warn about designated initializers,
so the following modification would not trigger a
warning:</p>

<p>struct s { int f, g, h; }; struct s x = { .f = 3, .g = 4
};</p>

<p>This warning is included in -Wextra. To get other
-Wextra warnings without this one, use -Wextra
-Wno-missing-field-initializers.</p>

<p>-Wmissing-noreturn Warn about functions which might be
candidates for attribute &quot;noreturn&quot;. Note these
are only possible candidates, not absolute ones. Care should
be taken to manually verify functions actually do not ever
return before adding the &quot;noreturn&quot; attribute,
otherwise subtle code generation bugs could be introduced.
You will not get a warning for &quot;main&quot; in hosted C
environments.</p>

<p>-Wmissing-format-attribute Warn about function pointers
which might be candidates for &quot;format&quot; attributes.
Note these are only possible candidates, not absolute ones.
GCC will guess that function pointers with
&quot;format&quot; attributes that are used in assignment,
initialization, parameter passing or return statements
should have a corresponding &quot;format&quot; attribute in
the resulting type. I.e. the left-hand side of the
assignment or initialization, the type of the parameter
variable, or the return type of the containing function
respectively should also have a &quot;format&quot; attribute
to avoid the warning.</p>

<p>GCC will also warn about function definitions which
might be candidates for &quot;format&quot; attributes.
Again, these are only possible candidates. GCC will guess
that &quot;format&quot; attributes might be appropriate for
any function that calls a function like &quot;vprintf&quot;
or &quot;vscanf&quot;, but this might not always be the
case, and some functions for which &quot;format&quot;
attributes are appropriate may not be detected.</p>

<p>-Wno-multichar Do not warn if a multicharacter constant
FOO) is used. Usually they indicate a typo in the users
code, as they have implementation-defined values, and should
not be used in portable code.</p>

<p>-Wnormalized=&lt;none|id|nfc|nfkc&gt; In ISO C and ISO
C++, two identifiers are different if they are different
sequences of characters. However, sometimes when characters
outside the basic ASCII character set are used, you can have
two different character sequences that look the same. To
avoid confusion, the ISO 10646 standard sets out some
normalization rules which when applied ensure that two
sequences that look the same are turned into the same
sequence. GCC can warn you if you are using identifiers
which have not been normalized; this option controls that
warning.</p>

<p>There are four levels of warning that GCC supports. The
default is -Wnormalized=nfc, which warns about any
identifier which is not in the ISO 10646 &quot;C&quot;
normalized form, NFC. NFC is the recommended form for most
uses.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there are some characters which ISO C and
ISO C++ allow in identifiers that when turned into NFC aren
t allowable as identifiers. That is, there s no way to use
these symbols in portable ISO C or C++ and have all your
identifiers in NFC. -Wnormalized=id suppresses the warning
for these characters. It is hoped that future versions of
the standards involved will correct this, which is why this
option is not the default.</p>

<p>You can switch the warning off for all characters by
writing -Wnormalized=none. You would only want to do this if
you were using some other normalization scheme (like
&quot;D&quot;), because otherwise you can easily create bugs
that are literally impossible to see.</p>

<p>Some characters in ISO 10646 have distinct meanings but
look identical in some fonts or display methodologies,
especially once formatting has been applied. For instance
&quot;207F&quot;, &quot;SUPERSCRIPT LATIN SMALL LETTER
N&quot;, will display just like a regular &quot;n&quot;
which has been placed in a superscript. ISO 10646 defines
the NFKC normalization scheme to convert all these into a
standard form as well, and GCC will warn if your code is not
in NFKC if you use -Wnormalized=nfkc. This warning is
comparable to warning about every identifier that contains
the letter O because it might be confused with the digit 0,
and so is not the default, but may be useful as a local
coding convention if the programming environment is unable
to be fixed to display these characters distinctly.</p>

<p>-Wno-deprecated Do not warn about usage of deprecated
features.</p>

<p>-Wno-deprecated-declarations Do not warn about uses of
functions, variables, and types marked as deprecated by
using the &quot;deprecated&quot; attribute.</p>

<p>-Wno-overflow Do not warn about compile-time overflow in
constant expressions.</p>

<p>-Woverride-init (C and Objective-C only) Warn if an
initialized field without side effects is overridden when
using designated initializers.</p>

<p>This warning is included in -Wextra. To get other
-Wextra warnings without this one, use -Wextra
-Wno-override-init.</p>

<p>-Wpacked Warn if a structure is given the packed
attribute, but the packed attribute has no effect on the
layout or size of the structure. Such structures may be
mis-aligned for little benefit. For instance, in this code,
the variable &quot;f.x&quot; in &quot;struct bar&quot; will
be misaligned even though &quot;struct bar&quot; does not
itself have the packed attribute:</p>

<p>struct foo { int x; char a, b, c, d; }
__attribute__((packed)); struct bar { char z; struct foo f;
};</p>

<p>-Wpacked-bitfield-compat The 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 series of
GCC ignore the &quot;packed&quot; attribute on bit-fields of
type &quot;char&quot;. This has been fixed in GCC 4.4 but
the change can lead to differences in the structure layout.
GCC informs you when the offset of such a field has changed
in GCC 4.4. For example there is no longer a 4-bit padding
between field &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; in this
structure:</p>

<p>struct foo { char a:4; char b:8; } __attribute__
((packed));</p>

<p>This warning is enabled by default. Use
-Wno-packed-bitfield-compat to disable this warning.</p>

<p>-Wpadded Warn if padding is included in a structure,
either to align an element of the structure or to align the
whole structure. Sometimes when this happens it is possible
to rearrange the fields of the structure to reduce the
padding and so make the structure smaller.</p>

<p>-Wredundant-decls Warn if anything is declared more than
once in the same scope, even in cases where multiple
declaration is valid and changes nothing.</p>

<p>-Wnested-externs (C and Objective-C only) Warn if an
&quot;extern&quot; declaration is encountered within a
function.</p>

<p>-Wunreachable-code Warn if the compiler detects that
code will never be executed.</p>

<p>This option is intended to warn when the compiler
detects that at least a whole line of source code will never
be executed, because some condition is never satisfied or
because it is after a procedure that never returns.</p>

<p>It is possible for this option to produce a warning even
though there are circumstances under which part of the
affected line can be executed, so care should be taken when
removing apparently- unreachable code.</p>

<p>For instance, when a function is inlined, a warning may
mean that the line is unreachable in only one inlined copy
of the function.</p>

<p>This option is not made part of -Wall because in a
debugging version of a program there is often substantial
code which checks correct functioning of the program and is,
hopefully, unreachable because the program does work.
Another common use of unreachable code is to provide
behavior which is selectable at compile-time.</p>

<p>-Winline Warn if a function can not be inlined and it
was declared as inline. Even with this option, the compiler
will not warn about failures to inline functions declared in
system headers.</p>

<p>The compiler uses a variety of heuristics to determine
whether or not to inline a function. For example, the
compiler takes into account the size of the function being
inlined and the amount of inlining that has already been
done in the current function. Therefore, seemingly
insignificant changes in the source program can cause the
warnings produced by -Winline to appear or disappear.</p>

<p>-Wno-invalid-offsetof (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
Suppress warnings from applying the offsetof macro to a
non-POD type. According to the 1998 ISO C++ standard,
applying offsetof to a non-POD type is undefined. In
existing C++ implementations, however, offsetof typically
gives meaningful results even when applied to certain kinds
of non-POD types. (Such as a simple struct that fails to be
a POD type only by virtue of having a constructor.) This
flag is for users who are aware that they are writing
nonportable code and who have deliberately chosen to ignore
the warning about it.</p>

<p>The restrictions on offsetof may be relaxed in a future
version of the C++ standard.</p>

<p>-Wno-int-to-pointer-cast (C and Objective-C only)
Suppress warnings from casts to pointer type of an integer
of a different size.</p>

<p>-Wno-pointer-to-int-cast (C and Objective-C only)
Suppress warnings from casts from a pointer to an integer
type of a different size.</p>

<p>-Winvalid-pch Warn if a precompiled header is found in
the search path but cant be used.</p>

<p>-Wlong-long Warn if long long type is used. This is
default. To inhibit the warning messages, use
-Wno-long-long. Flags -Wlong-long and -Wno-long-long are
taken into account only when -pedantic flag is used.</p>

<p>-Wvariadic-macros Warn if variadic macros are used in
pedantic ISO C90 mode, or the GNU alternate syntax when in
pedantic ISO C99 mode. This is default. To inhibit the
warning messages, use -Wno-variadic-macros.</p>

<p>-Wvla Warn if variable length array is used in the code.
-Wno-vla will prevent the -pedantic warning of the variable
length array.</p>

<p>-Wvolatile-register-var Warn if a register variable is
declared volatile. The volatile modifier does not inhibit
all optimizations that may eliminate reads and/or writes to
register variables. This warning is enabled by -Wall.</p>

<p>-Wdisabled-optimization Warn if a requested optimization
pass is disabled. This warning does not generally indicate
that there is anything wrong with your code; it merely
indicates that GCCs optimizers were unable to handle the
code effectively. Often, the problem is that your code is
too big or too complex; GCC will refuse to optimize programs
when the optimization itself is likely to take inordinate
amounts of time.</p>

<p>-Wpointer-sign (C and Objective-C only) Warn for pointer
argument passing or assignment with different signedness.
This option is only supported for C and Objective-C. It is
implied by -Wall and by -pedantic, which can be disabled
with -Wno-pointer-sign.</p>

<p>-Wstack-protector This option is only active when
-fstack-protector is active. It warns about functions that
will not be protected against stack smashing.</p>

<p>-Wno-mudflap Suppress warnings about constructs that
cannot be instrumented by -fmudflap.</p>

<p>-Woverlength-strings Warn about string constants which
are longer than the &quot;minimum maximum&quot; length
specified in the C standard. Modern compilers generally
allow string constants which are much longer than the
standards minimum limit, but very portable programs should
avoid using longer strings.</p>

<p>The limit applies after string constant concatenation,
and does not count the trailing NUL. In C89, the limit was
509 characters; in C99, it was raised to 4095. C++98 does
not specify a normative minimum maximum, so we do not
diagnose overlength strings in C++.</p>

<p>This option is implied by -pedantic, and can be disabled
with -Wno-overlength-strings.</p>

<p>Options for Debugging Your Program or GCC GCC has
various special options that are used for debugging either
your program or GCC:</p>

<p>-g Produce debugging information in the operating
systems native format (stabs, COFF, XCOFF, or DWARF 2). GDB
can work with this debugging information.</p>

<p>On most systems that use stabs format, -g enables use of
extra debugging information that only GDB can use; this
extra information makes debugging work better in GDB but
will probably make other debuggers crash or refuse to read
the program. If you want to control for certain whether to
generate the extra information, use -gstabs+, -gstabs,
-gxcoff+, -gxcoff, or -gvms (see below).</p>

<p>GCC allows you to use -g with -O. The shortcuts taken by
optimized code may occasionally produce surprising results:
some variables you declared may not exist at all; flow of
control may briefly move where you did not expect it; some
statements may not be executed because they compute constant
results or their values were already at hand; some
statements may execute in different places because they were
moved out of loops.</p>

<p>Nevertheless it proves possible to debug optimized
output. This makes it reasonable to use the optimizer for
programs that might have bugs.</p>

<p>The following options are useful when GCC is generated
with the capability for more than one debugging format.</p>

<p>-ggdb Produce debugging information for use by GDB. This
means to use the most expressive format available (DWARF 2,
stabs, or the native format if neither of those are
supported), including GDB extensions if at all possible.</p>

<p>-gstabs Produce debugging information in stabs format
(if that is supported), without GDB extensions. This is the
format used by DBX on most BSD systems. On MIPS, Alpha and
System V Release 4 systems this option produces stabs
debugging output which is not understood by DBX or SDB. On
System V Release 4 systems this option requires the GNU
assembler.</p>

<p>-feliminate-unused-debug-symbols Produce debugging
information in stabs format (if that is supported), for only
symbols that are actually used.</p>

<p>-femit-class-debug-always Instead of emitting debugging
information for a C++ class in only one object file, emit it
in all object files using the class. This option should be
used only with debuggers that are unable to handle the way
GCC normally emits debugging information for classes because
using this option will increase the size of debugging
information by as much as a factor of two.</p>

<p>-gstabs+ Produce debugging information in stabs format
(if that is supported), using GNU extensions understood only
by the GNU debugger (GDB). The use of these extensions is
likely to make other debuggers crash or refuse to read the
program.</p>

<p>-gcoff Produce debugging information in COFF format (if
that is supported). This is the format used by SDB on most
System V systems prior to System V Release 4.</p>

<p>-gxcoff Produce debugging information in XCOFF format
(if that is supported). This is the format used by the DBX
debugger on IBM RS/6000 systems.</p>

<p>-gxcoff+ Produce debugging information in XCOFF format
(if that is supported), using GNU extensions understood only
by the GNU debugger (GDB). The use of these extensions is
likely to make other debuggers crash or refuse to read the
program, and may cause assemblers other than the GNU
assembler (GAS) to fail with an error.</p>

<p>-gdwarf-version Produce debugging information in DWARF
format (if that is supported). This is the format used by
DBX on IRIX 6. The value of version may be either 2 or 3;
the default version is 3.</p>

<p>Note that with DWARF version 2 some ports require, and
will always use, some non-conflicting DWARF 3 extensions in
the unwind tables.</p>

<p>-gstrict-dwarf Disallow using extensions of later DWARF
standard version than selected with -gdwarf-version. On most
targets using non- conflicting DWARF extensions from later
standard versions is allowed.</p>

<p>-gno-strict-dwarf Allow using extensions of later DWARF
standard version than selected with -gdwarf-version.</p>

<p>-gvms Produce debugging information in VMS debug format
(if that is supported). This is the format used by DEBUG on
VMS systems.</p>

<p>-glevel -ggdblevel -gstabslevel -gcofflevel -gxcofflevel
-gvmslevel Request debugging information and also use level
to specify how much information. The default level is 2.</p>

<p>Level 0 produces no debug information at all. Thus, -g0
negates -g.</p>

<p>Level 1 produces minimal information, enough for making
backtraces in parts of the program that you dont plan to
debug. This includes descriptions of functions and external
variables, but no information about local variables and no
line numbers.</p>

<p>Level 3 includes extra information, such as all the
macro definitions present in the program. Some debuggers
support macro expansion when you use -g3.</p>

<p>-gdwarf-2 does not accept a concatenated debug level,
because GCC used to support an option -gdwarf that meant to
generate debug information in version 1 of the DWARF format
(which is very different from version 2), and it would have
been too confusing. That debug format is long obsolete, but
the option cannot be changed now. Instead use an additional
-glevel option to change the debug level for DWARF.</p>

<p>-gtoggle Turn off generation of debug info, if leaving
out this option would have generated it, or turn it on at
level 2 otherwise. The position of this argument in the
command line does not matter, it takes effect after all
other options are processed, and it does so only once, no
matter how many times it is given. This is mainly intended
to be used with -fcompare-debug.</p>

<p>-fdump-final-insns[=file] Dump the final internal
representation (RTL) to file. If the optional argument is
omitted (or if file is &quot;.&quot;), the name of the dump
file will be determined by appending &quot;.gkd&quot; to the
compilation output file name.</p>

<p>-fcompare-debug[=opts] If no error occurs during
compilation, run the compiler a second time, adding opts and
-fcompare-debug-second to the arguments passed to the second
compilation. Dump the final internal representation in both
compilations, and print an error if they differ.</p>

<p>If the equal sign is omitted, the default -gtoggle is
used.</p>

<p>The environment variable GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG, if defined,
non-empty and nonzero, implicitly enables -fcompare-debug.
If GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG is defined to a string starting with a
dash, then it is used for opts, otherwise the default
-gtoggle is used.</p>

<p>-fcompare-debug=, with the equal sign but without opts,
is equivalent to -fno-compare-debug, which disables the
dumping of the final representation and the second
compilation, preventing even GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG from taking
effect.</p>

<p>To verify full coverage during -fcompare-debug testing,
set GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG to say -fcompare-debug-not-overridden,
which GCC will reject as an invalid option in any actual
compilation (rather than preprocessing, assembly or
linking). To get just a warning, setting GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG
to -w%n-fcompare-debug not overridden will do.</p>

<p>-fcompare-debug-second This option is implicitly passed
to the compiler for the second compilation requested by
-fcompare-debug, along with options to silence warnings, and
omitting other options that would cause side- effect
compiler outputs to files or to the standard output. Dump
files and preserved temporary files are renamed so as to
contain the &quot;.gk&quot; additional extension during the
second compilation, to avoid overwriting those generated by
the first.</p>

<p>When this option is passed to the compiler driver, it
causes the first compilation to be skipped, which makes it
useful for little other than debugging the compiler
proper.</p>

<p>-feliminate-dwarf2-dups Compress DWARF2 debugging
information by eliminating duplicated information about each
symbol. This option only makes sense when generating DWARF2
debugging information with -gdwarf-2.</p>

<p>-femit-struct-debug-baseonly Emit debug information for
struct-like types only when the base name of the compilation
source file matches the base name of file in which the
struct was defined.</p>

<p>This option substantially reduces the size of debugging
information, but at significant potential loss in type
information to the debugger. See -femit-struct-debug-reduced
for a less aggressive option. See
-femit-struct-debug-detailed for more detailed control.</p>

<p>This option works only with DWARF 2.</p>

<p>-femit-struct-debug-reduced Emit debug information for
struct-like types only when the base name of the compilation
source file matches the base name of file in which the type
was defined, unless the struct is a template or defined in a
system header.</p>

<p>This option significantly reduces the size of debugging
information, with some potential loss in type information to
the debugger. See -femit-struct-debug-baseonly for a more
aggressive option. See -femit-struct-debug-detailed for more
detailed control.</p>

<p>This option works only with DWARF 2.</p>

<p>-femit-struct-debug-detailed[=spec-list] Specify the
struct-like types for which the compiler will generate debug
information. The intent is to reduce duplicate struct debug
information between different object files within the same
program.</p>

<p>This option is a detailed version of
-femit-struct-debug-reduced and
-femit-struct-debug-baseonly, which will serve for most
needs.</p>

<p>A specification has the syntax
[dir:|ind:][ord:|gen:](any|sys|base|none)</p>

<p>The optional first word limits the specification to
structs that are used directly (dir:) or used indirectly
(ind:). A struct type is used directly when it is the type
of a variable, member. Indirect uses arise through pointers
to structs. That is, when use of an incomplete struct would
be legal, the use is indirect. An example is struct one
direct; struct two * indirect;.</p>

<p>The optional second word limits the specification to
ordinary structs (ord:) or generic structs (gen:). Generic
structs are a bit complicated to explain. For C++, these are
non-explicit specializations of template classes, or
non-template classes within the above. Other programming
languages have generics, but -femit-struct-debug-detailed
does not yet implement them.</p>

<p>The third word specifies the source files for those
structs for which the compiler will emit debug information.
The values none and any have the normal meaning. The value
base means that the base of name of the file in which the
type declaration appears must match the base of the name of
the main compilation file. In practice, this means that
types declared in foo.c and foo.h will have debug
information, but types declared in other header will not.
The value sys means those types satisfying base or declared
in system or compiler headers.</p>

<p>You may need to experiment to determine the best
settings for your application.</p>

<p>The default is -femit-struct-debug-detailed=all.</p>

<p>This option works only with DWARF 2.</p>

<p>-fno-merge-debug-strings Direct the linker to not merge
together strings in the debugging information which are
identical in different object files. Merging is not
supported by all assemblers or linkers. Merging decreases
the size of the debug information in the output file at the
cost of increasing link processing time. Merging is enabled
by default.</p>

<p>-fdebug-prefix-map=old=new When compiling files in
directory old, record debugging information describing them
as in new instead.</p>

<p>-fno-dwarf2-cfi-asm Emit DWARF 2 unwind info as compiler
generated &quot;.eh_frame&quot; section instead of using GAS
&quot;.cfi_*&quot; directives.</p>

<p>-p Generate extra code to write profile information
suitable for the analysis program prof. You must use this
option when compiling the source files you want data about,
and you must also use it when linking.</p>

<p>-pg Generate extra code to write profile information
suitable for the analysis program gprof. You must use this
option when compiling the source files you want data about,
and you must also use it when linking.</p>

<p>-Q Makes the compiler print out each function name as it
is compiled, and print some statistics about each pass when
it finishes.</p>

<p>-ftime-report Makes the compiler print some statistics
about the time consumed by each pass when it finishes.</p>

<p>-fmem-report Makes the compiler print some statistics
about permanent memory allocation when it finishes.</p>

<p>-fpre-ipa-mem-report -fpost-ipa-mem-report Makes the
compiler print some statistics about permanent memory
allocation before or after interprocedural optimization.</p>

<p>-fprofile-arcs Add code so that program flow arcs are
instrumented. During execution the program records how many
times each branch and call is executed and how many times it
is taken or returns. When the compiled program exits it
saves this data to a file called auxname.gcda for each
source file. The data may be used for profile-directed
optimizations (-fbranch-probabilities), or for test coverage
analysis (-ftest-coverage). Each object files auxname is
generated from the name of the output file, if explicitly
specified and it is not the final executable, otherwise it
is the basename of the source file. In both cases any suffix
is removed (e.g. foo.gcda for input file dir/foo.c, or
dir/foo.gcda for output file specified as -o dir/foo.o).</p>

<p>--coverage This option is used to compile and link code
instrumented for coverage analysis. The option is a synonym
for -fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage (when compiling) and
-lgcov (when linking). See the documentation for those
options for more details.</p>

<p>&middot; Compile the source files with -fprofile-arcs
plus optimization and code generation options. For test
coverage analysis, use the additional -ftest-coverage
option. You do not need to profile every source file in a
program.</p>

<p>&middot; Link your object files with -lgcov or
-fprofile-arcs (the latter implies the former).</p>

<p>&middot; Run the program on a representative workload to
generate the arc profile information. This may be repeated
any number of times. You can run concurrent instances of
your program, and provided that the file system supports
locking, the data files will be correctly updated. Also
&quot;fork&quot; calls are detected and correctly handled
(double counting will not happen).</p>

<p>&middot; For profile-directed optimizations, compile the
source files again with the same optimization and code
generation options plus -fbranch-probabilities.</p>

<p>&middot; For test coverage analysis, use gcov to produce
human readable information from the .gcno and .gcda files.
Refer to the gcov documentation for further information.</p>

<p>With -fprofile-arcs, for each function of your program
GCC creates a program flow graph, then finds a spanning tree
for the graph. Only arcs that are not on the spanning tree
have to be instrumented: the compiler adds code to count the
number of times that these arcs are executed. When an arc is
the only exit or only entrance to a block, the
instrumentation code can be added to the block; otherwise, a
new basic block must be created to hold the instrumentation
code.</p>

<p>-ftest-coverage Produce a notes file that the gcov
code-coverage utility can use to show program coverage. Each
source files note file is called auxname.gcno. Refer to the
-fprofile-arcs option above for a description of auxname and
instructions on how to generate test coverage data. Coverage
data will match the source files more closely, if you do not
optimize.</p>

<p>-fdbg-cnt-list Print the name and the counter upperbound
for all debug counters.</p>

<p>-fdbg-cnt=counter-value-list Set the internal debug
counter upperbound. counter-value-list is a comma-separated
list of name:value pairs which sets the upperbound of each
debug counter name to value. All debug counters have the
initial upperbound of UINT_MAX, thus dbg_cnt() returns true
always unless the upperbound is set by this option. e.g.
With -fdbg-cnt=dce:10,tail_call:0 dbg_cnt(dce) will return
true only for first 10 invocations and dbg_cnt(tail_call)
will return false always.</p>

<p>-dletters -fdump-rtl-pass Says to make debugging dumps
during compilation at times specified by letters. This is
used for debugging the RTL-based passes of the compiler. The
file names for most of the dumps are made by appending a
pass number and a word to the dumpname. dumpname is
generated from the name of the output file, if explicitly
specified and it is not an executable, otherwise it is the
basename of the source file. These switches may have
different effects when -E is used for preprocessing.</p>

<p>Debug dumps can be enabled with a -fdump-rtl switch or
some -d option letters. Here are the possible letters for
use in pass and letters, and their meanings:</p>

<p>-fdump-rtl-alignments Dump after branch alignments have
been computed.</p>

<p>-fdump-rtl-asmcons Dump after fixing rtl statements that
have unsatisfied in/out constraints.</p>

elimination passes.</p>

<p>-fdump-rtl-dbr Dump after delayed branch scheduling.</p>

<p>-fdump-rtl-dce1 -fdump-rtl-dce2 -fdump-rtl-dce1 and
-fdump-rtl-dce2 enable dumping after the two dead store
elimination passes.</p>

code.</p>

handling range regions.</p>

<p>-fdump-rtl-expand Dump after RTL generation.</p>

propagation passes.</p>

-fdump-rtl-gcse2 enable dumping after global common
subexpression elimination.</p>

the registers.</p>

<p>-fdump-rtl-initvals Dump after the computation of the
initial value sets.</p>

<p>-fdump-rtl-into_cfglayout Dump after converting to
cfglayout mode.</p>

<p>-fdump-rtl-ira Dump after iterated register
allocation.</p>

<p>-fdump-rtl-jump Dump after the second jump
optimization.</p>

pass.</p>

<p>-fdump-rtl-sched1 -fdump-rtl-sched2 -fdump-rtl-sched1
and -fdump-rtl-sched2 enable dumping after the basic block
scheduling passes.</p>

<p>-fdump-rtl-see Dump after sign extension
elimination.</p>

<p>-fdump-rtl-seqabstr Dump after common sequence
discovery.</p>

<p>-fdump-rtl-shorten Dump after shortening branches.</p>

optimizations.</p>

<p>-fdump-rtl-split1 -fdump-rtl-split2 -fdump-rtl-split3
-fdump-rtl-split4 -fdump-rtl-split5 -fdump-rtl-split1,

instruction splitting.</p>

<p>-fdump-rtl-sms Dump after modulo scheduling. This pass
is only run on some architectures.</p>

<p>-fdump-rtl-stack Dump after conversion from GCCs
&quot;flat register file&quot; registers to the x87s
stack-like registers. This pass is only run on x86
variants.</p>

<p>-fdump-rtl-subreg1 -fdump-rtl-subreg2 -fdump-rtl-subreg1
and -fdump-rtl-subreg2 enable dumping after the two subreg
expansion passes.</p>

unshared.</p>

<p>-fdump-rtl-vartrack Dump after variable tracking.</p>

<p>-fdump-rtl-vregs Dump after converting virtual registers
to hard registers.</p>

<p>-fdump-rtl-web Dump after live range splitting.</p>

<p>-fdump-rtl-regclass -fdump-rtl-subregs_of_mode_init
-fdump-rtl-subregs_of_mode_finish -fdump-rtl-dfinit
-fdump-rtl-dfinish These dumps are defined but always
produce empty files.</p>

<p>-fdump-rtl-all Produce all the dumps listed above.</p>

<p>-dA Annotate the assembler output with miscellaneous
debugging information.</p>

<p>-dD Dump all macro definitions, at the end of
preprocessing, in addition to normal output.</p>

<p>-dH Produce a core dump whenever an error occurs.</p>

<p>-dm Print statistics on memory usage, at the end of the
run, to standard error.</p>

<p>-dp Annotate the assembler output with a comment
indicating which pattern and alternative was used. The
length of each instruction is also printed.</p>

<p>-dP Dump the RTL in the assembler output as a comment
before each instruction. Also turns on -dp annotation.</p>

<p>-dv For each of the other indicated dump files
(-fdump-rtl-pass), dump a representation of the control flow
graph suitable for viewing with VCG to file.pass.vcg.</p>

<p>-dx Just generate RTL for a function instead of
compiling it. Usually used with -fdump-rtl-expand.</p>

<p>-dy Dump debugging information during parsing, to
standard error.</p>

<p>-fdump-noaddr When doing debugging dumps, suppress
address output. This makes it more feasible to use diff on
debugging dumps for compiler invocations with different
compiler binaries and/or different text / bss / data / heap
/ stack / dso start locations.</p>

<p>-fdump-unnumbered When doing debugging dumps, suppress
instruction numbers and address output. This makes it more
feasible to use diff on debugging dumps for compiler
invocations with different options, in particular with and
without -g.</p>

<p>-fdump-unnumbered-links When doing debugging dumps (see
-d option above), suppress instruction numbers for the links
to the previous and next instructions in a sequence.</p>

<p>-fdump-translation-unit (C++ only)
-fdump-translation-unit-options (C++ only) Dump a
representation of the tree structure for the entire
translation unit to a file. The file name is made by
appending .tu to the source file name. If the -options form
is used, options controls the details of the dump as
described for the -fdump-tree options.</p>

<p>-fdump-class-hierarchy (C++ only)
-fdump-class-hierarchy-options (C++ only) Dump a
representation of each class s hierarchy and virtual
function table layout to a file. The file name is made by
appending .class to the source file name. If the -options
form is used, options controls the details of the dump as
described for the -fdump-tree options.</p>

<p>-fdump-ipa-switch Control the dumping at various stages
of inter-procedural analysis language tree to a file. The
file name is generated by appending a switch specific suffix
to the source file name. The following dumps are
possible:</p>

<p>all Enables all inter-procedural analysis dumps.</p>

<p>cgraph Dumps information about call-graph optimization,
unused function removal, and inlining decisions.</p>

<p>inline Dump after function inlining.</p>

<p>-fdump-statistics-option Enable and control dumping of
pass statistics in a separate file. The file name is
generated by appending a suffix ending in .statistics to the
source file name. If the -option form is used, -stats will
cause counters to be summed over the whole compilation unit
while -details will dump every event as the passes generate
them. The default with no option is to sum counters for each
function compiled.</p>

<p>-fdump-tree-switch -fdump-tree-switch-options Control
the dumping at various stages of processing the intermediate
language tree to a file. The file name is generated by
appending a switch specific suffix to the source file name.
If the -options form is used, options is a list of -
separated options that control the details of the dump. Not
all options are applicable to all dumps, those which are not
meaningful will be ignored. The following options are
available</p>

<p>address Print the address of each node. Usually this is
not meaningful as it changes according to the environment
and source file. Its primary use is for tying up a dump file
with a debug environment.</p>

<p>slim Inhibit dumping of members of a scope or body of a
function merely because that scope has been reached. Only
dump such items when they are directly reachable by some
other path. When dumping pretty-printed trees, this option
inhibits dumping the bodies of control structures.</p>

<p>raw Print a raw representation of the tree. By default,
trees are pretty-printed into a C-like representation.</p>

<p>details Enable more detailed dumps (not honored by every
dump option).</p>

<p>stats Enable dumping various statistics about the pass
(not honored by every dump option).</p>

<p>blocks Enable showing basic block boundaries (disabled
in raw dumps).</p>

<p>vops Enable showing virtual operands for every
statement.</p>

<p>lineno Enable showing line numbers for statements.</p>

<p>uid Enable showing the unique ID (&quot;DECL_UID&quot;)
for each variable.</p>

<p>verbose Enable showing the tree dump for each
statement.</p>

<p>all Turn on all options, except raw, slim, verbose and
lineno.</p>

<p>The following tree dumps are possible:</p>

<p>original Dump before any tree based optimization, to
file.original.</p>

<p>optimized Dump after all tree based optimization, to
file.optimized.</p>

<p>gimple Dump each function before and after the
gimplification pass to a file. The file name is made by
appending .gimple to the source file name.</p>

<p>cfg Dump the control flow graph of each function to a
file. The file name is made by appending .cfg to the source
file name.</p>

<p>vcg Dump the control flow graph of each function to a
file in VCG format. The file name is made by appending .vcg
to the source file name. Note that if the file contains more
than one function, the generated file cannot be used
directly by VCG. You will need to cut and paste each
function s graph into its own separate file first.</p>

<p>ch Dump each function after copying loop headers. The
file name is made by appending .ch to the source file
name.</p>

<p>ssa Dump SSA related information to a file. The file
name is made by appending .ssa to the source file name.</p>

<p>alias Dump aliasing information for each function. The
file name is made by appending .alias to the source file
name.</p>

<p>ccp Dump each function after CCP. The file name is made
by appending .ccp to the source file name.</p>

<p>storeccp Dump each function after STORE-CCP. The file
name is made by appending .storeccp to the source file
name.</p>

<p>pre Dump trees after partial redundancy elimination. The
file name is made by appending .pre to the source file
name.</p>

<p>fre Dump trees after full redundancy elimination. The
file name is made by appending .fre to the source file
name.</p>

<p>copyprop Dump trees after copy propagation. The file
name is made by appending .copyprop to the source file
name.</p>

<p>store_copyprop Dump trees after store copy-propagation.
The file name is made by appending .store_copyprop to the
source file name.</p>

<p>dce Dump each function after dead code elimination. The
file name is made by appending .dce to the source file
name.</p>

<p>mudflap Dump each function after adding mudflap
instrumentation. The file name is made by appending .mudflap
to the source file name.</p>

<p>sra Dump each function after performing scalar
replacement of aggregates. The file name is made by
appending .sra to the source file name.</p>

<p>sink Dump each function after performing code sinking.
The file name is made by appending .sink to the source file
name.</p>

<p>dom Dump each function after applying dominator tree
optimizations. The file name is made by appending .dom to
the source file name.</p>

<p>dse Dump each function after applying dead store
elimination. The file name is made by appending .dse to the
source file name.</p>

<p>phiopt Dump each function after optimizing PHI nodes
into straightline code. The file name is made by appending
.phiopt to the source file name.</p>

<p>forwprop Dump each function after forward propagating
single use variables. The file name is made by appending
.forwprop to the source file name.</p>

<p>copyrename Dump each function after applying the copy
rename optimization. The file name is made by appending
.copyrename to the source file name.</p>

<p>nrv Dump each function after applying the named return
value optimization on generic trees. The file name is made
by appending .nrv to the source file name.</p>

<p>vect Dump each function after applying vectorization of
loops. The file name is made by appending .vect to the
source file name.</p>

<p>vrp Dump each function after Value Range Propagation
(VRP). The file name is made by appending .vrp to the source
file name.</p>

<p>all Enable all the available tree dumps with the flags
provided in this option.</p>

<p>-ftree-vectorizer-verbose=n This option controls the
amount of debugging output the vectorizer prints. This
information is written to standard error, unless
-fdump-tree-all or -fdump-tree-vect is specified, in which
case it is output to the usual dump listing file, .vect. For
n=0 no diagnostic information is reported. If n=1 the
vectorizer reports each loop that got vectorized, and the
total number of loops that got vectorized. If n=2 the
vectorizer also reports non-vectorized loops that passed the
first analysis phase (vect_analyze_loop_form) - i.e.
countable, inner-most, single-bb, single-entry/exit loops.
This is the same verbosity level that -fdump-tree-vect-stats
uses. Higher verbosity levels mean either more information
dumped for each reported loop, or same amount of information
reported for more loops: If n=3, alignment related
information is added to the reports. If n=4, data-references
related information (e.g. memory dependences, memory
access-patterns) is added to the reports. If n=5, the
vectorizer reports also non-vectorized inner-most loops that
did not pass the first analysis phase (i.e., may not be
countable, or may have complicated control-flow). If n=6,
the vectorizer reports also non-vectorized nested loops. For
n=7, all the information the vectorizer generates during its
analysis and transformation is reported. This is the same
verbosity level that -fdump-tree-vect-details uses.</p>

<p>-frandom-seed=string This option provides a seed that
GCC uses when it would otherwise use random numbers. It is
used to generate certain symbol names that have to be
different in every compiled file. It is also used to place
unique stamps in coverage data files and the object files
that produce them. You can use the -frandom-seed option to
produce reproducibly identical object files.</p>

<p>The string should be different for every file you
compile.</p>

<p>-fsched-verbose=n On targets that use instruction
scheduling, this option controls the amount of debugging
output the scheduler prints. This information is written to
standard error, unless -fdump-rtl-sched1 or
-fdump-rtl-sched2 is specified, in which case it is output
to the usual dump listing file, .sched or .sched2
respectively. However for n greater than nine, the output is
always printed to standard error.</p>

<p>For n greater than zero, -fsched-verbose outputs the
same information as -fdump-rtl-sched1 and -fdump-rtl-sched2.
For n greater than one, it also output basic block
probabilities, detailed ready list information and unit/insn
info. For n greater than two, it includes RTL at abort
point, control-flow and regions info. And for n over four,
-fsched-verbose also includes dependence info.</p>

<p>-save-temps Store the usual &quot;temporary&quot;
intermediate files permanently; place them in the current
directory and name them based on the source file. Thus,
compiling foo.c with -c -save-temps would produce files
foo.i and foo.s, as well as foo.o. This creates a
preprocessed foo.i output file even though the compiler now
normally uses an integrated preprocessor.</p>

<p>When used in combination with the -x command line
option, -save-temps is sensible enough to avoid over writing
an input source file with the same extension as an
intermediate file. The corresponding intermediate file may
be obtained by renaming the source file before using
-save-temps.</p>

<p>-time[=file] Report the CPU time taken by each
subprocess in the compilation sequence. For C source files,
this is the compiler proper and assembler (plus the linker
if linking is done).</p>

<p>Without the specification of an output file, the output
looks like this:</p>

<p># cc1 0.12 0.01 # as 0.00 0.01</p>

<p>The first number on each line is the &quot;user
time&quot;, that is time spent executing the program itself.
The second number is &quot;system time&quot;, time spent
executing operating system routines on behalf of the
program. Both numbers are in seconds.</p>

<p>With the specification of an output file, the output is
appended to the named file, and it looks like this:</p>

<p>0.12 0.01 cc1 &lt;options&gt; 0.00 0.01 as
&lt;options&gt;</p>

<p>The &quot;user time&quot; and the &quot;system
time&quot; are moved before the program name, and the
options passed to the program are displayed, so that one can
later tell what file was being compiled, and with which
options.</p>

<p>-fvar-tracking Run variable tracking pass. It computes
where variables are stored at each position in code. Better
debugging information is then generated (if the debugging
information format supports this information).</p>

<p>It is enabled by default when compiling with
optimization (-Os, -O, -O2, ...), debugging information (-g)
and the debug info format supports it.</p>

<p>-fvar-tracking-assignments Annotate assignments to user
variables early in the compilation and attempt to carry the
annotations over throughout the compilation all the way to
the end, in an attempt to improve debug information while
optimizing.</p>

<p>It can be enabled even if var-tracking is disabled, in
which case annotations will be created and maintained, but
discarded at the end.</p>

<p>-fvar-tracking-assignments-toggle Toggle
-fvar-tracking-assignments, in the same way that -gtoggle
toggles -g.</p>

<p>-print-file-name=library Print the full absolute name of
the library file library that would be used when
linking---and don t do anything else. With this option, GCC
does not compile or link anything; it just prints the file
name.</p>

<p>-print-multi-directory Print the directory name
corresponding to the multilib selected by any other switches
present in the command line. This directory is supposed to
exist in GCC_EXEC_PREFIX.</p>

<p>-print-multi-lib Print the mapping from multilib
directory names to compiler switches that enable them. The
directory name is separated from the switches by ;, and each
switch starts with an @} instead of the @samp{-, without
spaces between multiple switches. This is supposed to ease
shell-processing.</p>

<p>-print-multi-os-directory Print the path to OS libraries
for the selected multilib, relative to some lib
subdirectory. If OS libraries are present in the lib
subdirectory and no multilibs are used, this is usually just
., if OS libraries are present in libsuffix sibling
directories this prints e.g. ../lib64, ../lib or ../lib32,
or if OS libraries are present in lib/subdir subdirectories
it prints e.g. amd64, sparcv9 or ev6.</p>

<p>-print-prog-name=program Like -print-file-name, but
searches for a program such as cpp.</p>

<p>-print-libgcc-file-name Same as
-print-file-name=libgcc.a.</p>

<p>This is useful when you use -nostdlib or -nodefaultlibs
but you do want to link with libgcc.a. You can do</p>

<p>gcc -nostdlib &lt;files&gt;... &lsquo;gcc
-print-libgcc-file-name&lsquo;</p>

<p>-print-search-dirs Print the name of the configured
installation directory and a list of program and library
directories gcc will search---and dont do anything else.</p>

<p>This is useful when gcc prints the error message
installation problem, cannot exec cpp0: No such file or
directory. To resolve this you either need to put cpp0 and
the other compiler components where gcc expects to find
them, or you can set the environment variable
GCC_EXEC_PREFIX to the directory where you installed them.
Dont forget the trailing /.</p>

<p>-print-sysroot Print the target sysroot directory that
will be used during compilation. This is the target sysroot
specified either at configure time or using the --sysroot
option, possibly with an extra suffix that depends on
compilation options. If no target sysroot is specified, the
option prints nothing.</p>

<p>-print-sysroot-headers-suffix Print the suffix added to
the target sysroot when searching for headers, or give an
error if the compiler is not configured with such a
suffix---and dont do anything else.</p>

<p>-dumpmachine Print the compilers target machine (for
example, i686-pc-linux-gnu)---and dont do anything else.</p>

<p>-dumpversion Print the compiler version (for example,
3.0)---and dont do anything else.</p>

<p>-dumpspecs Print the compiler s built-in specs---and don
t do anything else. (This is used when GCC itself is being
built.)</p>

<p>-feliminate-unused-debug-types Normally, when producing
DWARF2 output, GCC will emit debugging information for all
types declared in a compilation unit, regardless of whether
or not they are actually used in that compilation unit.
Sometimes this is useful, such as if, in the debugger, you
want to cast a value to a type that is not actually used in
your program (but is declared). More often, however, this
results in a significant amount of wasted space. With this
option, GCC will avoid producing debug symbol output for
types that are nowhere used in the source file being
compiled.</p>

<p>Options That Control Optimization These options control
various sorts of optimizations.</p>

<p>Without any optimization option, the compilers goal is
to reduce the cost of compilation and to make debugging
produce the expected results. Statements are independent: if
you stop the program with a breakpoint between statements,
you can then assign a new value to any variable or change
the program counter to any other statement in the function
and get exactly the results you would expect from the source
code.</p>

<p>Turning on optimization flags makes the compiler attempt
to improve the performance and/or code size at the expense
of compilation time and possibly the ability to debug the
program.</p>

<p>The compiler performs optimization based on the
knowledge it has of the program. Compiling multiple files at
once to a single output file mode allows the compiler to use
information gained from all of the files when compiling each
of them.</p>

<p>Not all optimizations are controlled directly by a flag.
Only optimizations that have a flag are listed.</p>

<p>-O -O1 Optimize. Optimizing compilation takes somewhat
more time, and a lot more memory for a large function.</p>

<p>With -O, the compiler tries to reduce code size and
execution time, without performing any optimizations that
take a great deal of compilation time.</p>

<p>-O turns on the following optimization flags:</p>

<p>-fauto-inc-dec -fcprop-registers -fdce -fdefer-pop
-fdelayed-branch -fdse -fguess-branch-probability
-fif-conversion2 -fif-conversion -finline-small-functions
-fipa-pure-const -fipa-reference -fmerge-constants
-fsplit-wide-types -ftree-builtin-call-dce -ftree-ccp
-ftree-ch -ftree-copyrename -ftree-dce -ftree-dominator-opts
-ftree-dse -ftree-fre -ftree-sra -ftree-ter
-funit-at-a-time</p>

<p>-O also turns on -fomit-frame-pointer on machines where
doing so does not interfere with debugging.</p>

<p>-O2 Optimize even more. GCC performs nearly all
supported optimizations that do not involve a space-speed
tradeoff. As compared to -O, this option increases both
compilation time and the performance of the generated
code.</p>

<p>-O2 turns on all optimization flags specified by -O. It
also turns on the following optimization flags:
-fthread-jumps -falign-functions -falign-jumps -falign-loops
-falign-labels -fcaller-saves -fcrossjumping
-fcse-follow-jumps -fcse-skip-blocks
-fdelete-null-pointer-checks -fexpensive-optimizations
-fgcse -fgcse-lm -findirect-inlining
-foptimize-sibling-calls -fpeephole2 -fregmove
-freorder-blocks -freorder-functions -frerun-cse-after-loop
-fsched-interblock -fsched-spec -fschedule-insns
-fschedule-insns2 -fstrict-aliasing -fstrict-overflow
-ftree-switch-conversion -ftree-pre -ftree-vrp</p>

<p>Please note the warning under -fgcse about invoking -O2
on programs that use computed gotos.</p>

<p>-O3 Optimize yet more. -O3 turns on all optimizations
specified by -O2 and also turns on the -finline-functions,
-funswitch-loops, -fpredictive-commoning,
-fgcse-after-reload and -ftree-vectorize options.</p>

<p>-O0 Reduce compilation time and make debugging produce
the expected results. This is the default.</p>

<p>-Os Optimize for size. -Os enables all -O2 optimizations
that do not typically increase code size. It also performs
further optimizations designed to reduce code size.</p>

<p>-Os disables the following optimization flags:
-falign-functions -falign-jumps -falign-loops -falign-labels
-freorder-blocks -freorder-blocks-and-partition
-fprefetch-loop-arrays -ftree-vect-loop-version</p>

<p>If you use multiple -O options, with or without level
numbers, the last such option is the one that is
effective.</p>

<p>Options of the form -fflag specify machine-independent
flags. Most flags have both positive and negative forms; the
negative form of -ffoo would be -fno-foo. In the table
below, only one of the forms is listed---the one you
typically will use. You can figure out the other form by
either removing no- or adding it.</p>

<p>The following options control specific optimizations.
They are either activated by -O options or are related to
ones that are. You can use the following flags in the rare
cases when &quot;fine-tuning&quot; of optimizations to be
performed is desired.</p>

<p>-fno-default-inline Do not make member functions inline
by default merely because they are defined inside the class
scope (C++ only). Otherwise, when you specify -O, member
functions defined inside class scope are compiled inline by
default; i.e., you dont need to add inline in front of the
member function name.</p>

<p>-fno-defer-pop Always pop the arguments to each function
call as soon as that function returns. For machines which
must pop arguments after a function call, the compiler
normally lets arguments accumulate on the stack for several
function calls and pops them all at once.</p>

<p>Disabled at levels -O, -O2, -O3, -Os.</p>

<p>-fforward-propagate Perform a forward propagation pass
on RTL. The pass tries to combine two instructions and
checks if the result can be simplified. If loop unrolling is
active, two passes are performed and the second is scheduled
after loop unrolling.</p>

<p>This option is enabled by default at optimization levels
-O2, -O3, -Os.</p>

<p>-fomit-frame-pointer Don t keep the frame pointer in a
register for functions that dont need one. This avoids the
instructions to save, set up and restore frame pointers; it
also makes an extra register available in many functions. It
also makes debugging impossible on some machines.</p>

<p>On some machines, such as the VAX, this flag has no
effect, because the standard calling sequence automatically
handles the frame pointer and nothing is saved by pretending
it doesnt exist. The machine-description macro
&quot;FRAME_POINTER_REQUIRED&quot; controls whether a target
machine supports this flag.</p>

<p>Enabled at levels -O, -O2, -O3, -Os.</p>

<p>-foptimize-sibling-calls Optimize sibling and tail
recursive calls.</p>

<p>Enabled at levels -O2, -O3, -Os.</p>

<p>-fno-inline Don t pay attention to the
&quot;inline&quot; keyword. Normally this option is used to
keep the compiler from expanding any functions inline. Note
that if you are not optimizing, no functions can be expanded
inline.</p>

<p>-finline-small-functions Integrate functions into their
callers when their body is smaller than expected function
call code (so overall size of program gets smaller). The
compiler heuristically decides which functions are simple
enough to be worth integrating in this way.</p>

<p>Enabled at level -O2.</p>

<p>-findirect-inlining Inline also indirect calls that are
discovered to be known at compile time thanks to previous
inlining. This option has any effect only when inlining
itself is turned on by the -finline-functions or
-finline-small-functions options.</p>

<p>Enabled at level -O2.</p>

<p>-finline-functions Integrate all simple functions into
their callers. The compiler heuristically decides which
functions are simple enough to be worth integrating in this
way.</p>

<p>If all calls to a given function are integrated, and the
function is declared &quot;static&quot;, then the function
is normally not output as assembler code in its own
right.</p>

<p>Enabled at level -O3.</p>

<p>-finline-functions-called-once Consider all
&quot;static&quot; functions called once for inlining into
their caller even if they are not marked &quot;inline&quot;.
If a call to a given function is integrated, then the
function is not output as assembler code in its own
right.</p>

<p>Enabled at levels -O1, -O2, -O3 and -Os.</p>

<p>-fearly-inlining Inline functions marked by
&quot;always_inline&quot; and functions whose body seems
smaller than the function call overhead early before doing
-fprofile-generate instrumentation and real inlining pass.
Doing so makes profiling significantly cheaper and usually
inlining faster on programs having large chains of nested
wrapper functions.</p>

<p>Enabled by default.</p>

<p>-finline-limit=n By default, GCC limits the size of
functions that can be inlined. This flag allows coarse
control of this limit. n is the size of functions that can
be inlined in number of pseudo instructions.</p>

<p>Inlining is actually controlled by a number of
parameters, which may be specified individually by using
--param name=value. The -finline-limit=n option sets some of
these parameters as follows:</p>

<p>max-inline-insns-single is set to n/2.</p>

<p>max-inline-insns-auto is set to n/2.</p>

<p>See below for a documentation of the individual
parameters controlling inlining and for the defaults of
these parameters.</p>

<p>Note: there may be no value to -finline-limit that
results in default behavior.</p>

<p>Note: pseudo instruction represents, in this particular
context, an abstract measurement of functions size. In no
way does it represent a count of assembly instructions and
as such its exact meaning might change from one release to
an another.</p>

<p>-fkeep-inline-functions In C, emit &quot;static&quot;
functions that are declared &quot;inline&quot; into the
object file, even if the function has been inlined into all
of its callers. This switch does not affect functions using
the &quot;extern inline&quot; extension in GNU C89. In C++,
emit any and all inline functions into the object file.</p>

<p>-fkeep-static-consts Emit variables declared
&quot;static const&quot; when optimization isnt turned on,
even if the variables arent referenced.</p>

<p>GCC enables this option by default. If you want to force
the compiler to check if the variable was referenced,
regardless of whether or not optimization is turned on, use
the -fno-keep-static-consts option.</p>

<p>-fmerge-constants Attempt to merge identical constants
(string constants and floating point constants) across
compilation units.</p>

<p>This option is the default for optimized compilation if
the assembler and linker support it. Use
-fno-merge-constants to inhibit this behavior.</p>

<p>Enabled at levels -O, -O2, -O3, -Os.</p>

<p>-fmerge-all-constants Attempt to merge identical
constants and identical variables.</p>

<p>This option implies -fmerge-constants. In addition to
-fmerge-constants this considers e.g. even constant
initialized arrays or initialized constant variables with
integral or floating point types. Languages like C or C++
require each variable, including multiple instances of the
same variable in recursive calls, to have distinct
locations, so using this option will result in
non-conforming behavior.</p>

<p>-fmodulo-sched Perform swing modulo scheduling
immediately before the first scheduling pass. This pass
looks at innermost loops and reorders their instructions by
overlapping different iterations.</p>

<p>-fmodulo-sched-allow-regmoves Perform more aggressive
SMS based modulo scheduling with register moves allowed. By
setting this flag certain anti-dependences edges will be
deleted which will trigger the generation of reg-moves based
on the life-range analysis. This option is effective only
with -fmodulo-sched enabled.</p>

<p>-fno-branch-count-reg Do not use &quot;decrement and
branch&quot; instructions on a count register, but instead
generate a sequence of instructions that decrement a
register, compare it against zero, then branch based upon
the result. This option is only meaningful on architectures
that support such instructions, which include x86, PowerPC,
IA-64 and S/390.</p>

<p>The default is -fbranch-count-reg.</p>

<p>-fno-function-cse Do not put function addresses in
registers; make each instruction that calls a constant
function contain the function s address explicitly.</p>

<p>This option results in less efficient code, but some
strange hacks that alter the assembler output may be
confused by the optimizations performed when this option is
not used.</p>

<p>The default is -ffunction-cse</p>

<p>-fno-zero-initialized-in-bss If the target supports a
BSS section, GCC by default puts variables that are
initialized to zero into BSS. This can save space in the
resulting code.</p>

<p>This option turns off this behavior because some
programs explicitly rely on variables going to the data
section. E.g., so that the resulting executable can find the
beginning of that section and/or make assumptions based on
that.</p>

<p>The default is -fzero-initialized-in-bss.</p>

<p>-fmudflap -fmudflapth -fmudflapir For front-ends that
support it (C and C++), instrument all risky pointer/array
dereferencing operations, some standard library string/heap
functions, and some other associated constructs with
range/validity tests. Modules so instrumented should be
immune to buffer overflows, invalid heap use, and some other
classes of C/C++ programming errors. The instrumentation
relies on a separate runtime library (libmudflap), which
will be linked into a program if -fmudflap is given at link
time. Run-time behavior of the instrumented program is
controlled by the MUDFLAP_OPTIONS environment variable. See
&quot;env MUDFLAP_OPTIONS=-help a.out&quot; for its
options.</p>

<p>Use -fmudflapth instead of -fmudflap to compile and to
link if your program is multi-threaded. Use -fmudflapir, in
addition to -fmudflap or -fmudflapth, if instrumentation
should ignore pointer reads. This produces less
instrumentation (and therefore faster execution) and still
provides some protection against outright memory corrupting
writes, but allows erroneously read data to propagate within
a program.</p>

<p>-fthread-jumps Perform optimizations where we check to
see if a jump branches to a location where another
comparison subsumed by the first is found. If so, the first
branch is redirected to either the destination of the second
branch or a point immediately following it, depending on
whether the condition is known to be true or false.</p>

<p>Enabled at levels -O2, -O3, -Os.</p>

<p>-fsplit-wide-types When using a type that occupies
multiple registers, such as &quot;long long&quot; on a
32-bit system, split the registers apart and allocate them
independently. This normally generates better code for those
types, but may make debugging more difficult.</p>

<p>Enabled at levels -O, -O2, -O3, -Os.</p>

<p>-fcse-follow-jumps In common subexpression elimination
(CSE), scan through jump instructions when the target of the
jump is not reached by any other path. For example, when CSE
encounters an &quot;if&quot; statement with an
&quot;else&quot; clause, CSE will follow the jump when the
condition tested is false.</p>

<p>Enabled at levels -O2, -O3, -Os.</p>

<p>-fcse-skip-blocks This is similar to -fcse-follow-jumps,
but causes CSE to follow jumps which conditionally skip over
blocks. When CSE encounters a simple &quot;if&quot;
statement with no else clause, -fcse-skip-blocks causes CSE
to follow the jump around the body of the
&quot;if&quot;.</p>

<p>Enabled at levels -O2, -O3, -Os.</p>

<p>-frerun-cse-after-loop Re-run common subexpression
elimination after loop optimizations has been performed.</p>

<p>Enabled at levels -O2, -O3, -Os.</p>

<p>-fgcse Perform a global common subexpression elimination
pass. This pass also performs global constant and copy
propagation.</p>

<p>Note: When compiling a program using computed gotos, a
GCC extension, you may get better runtime performance if you
disable the global common subexpression elimination pass by
adding -fno-gcse to the command line.</p>

<p>Enabled at levels -O2, -O3, -Os.</p>

<p>-fgcse-lm When -fgcse-lm is enabled, global common
subexpression elimination will attempt to move loads which
are only killed by stores into themselves. This allows a
loop containing a load/store sequence to be changed to a
load outside the loop, and a copy/store within the loop.</p>

<p>Enabled by default when gcse is enabled.</p>

<p>-fgcse-sm When -fgcse-sm is enabled, a store motion pass
is run after global common subexpression elimination. This
pass will attempt to move stores out of loops. When used in
conjunction with -fgcse-lm, loops containing a load/store
sequence can be changed to a load before the loop and a
store after the loop.</p>

<p>Not enabled at any optimization level.</p>

<p>-fgcse-las When -fgcse-las is enabled, the global common
subexpression elimination pass eliminates redundant loads
that come after stores to the same memory location (both
partial and full redundancies).</p>

<p>Not enabled at any optimization level.</p>

<p>-fgcse-after-reload When -fgcse-after-reload is enabled,
a redundant load elimination pass is performed after reload.
The purpose of this pass is to cleanup redundant
spilling.</p>

<p>-funsafe-loop-optimizations If given, the loop optimizer
will assume that loop indices do not overflow, and that the
loops with nontrivial exit condition are not infinite. This
enables a wider range of loop optimizations even if the loop
optimizer itself cannot prove that these assumptions are
valid. Using -Wunsafe-loop-optimizations, the compiler will
warn you if it finds this kind of loop.</p>

<p>-fcrossjumping Perform cross-jumping transformation.
This transformation unifies equivalent code and save code
size. The resulting code may or may not perform better than
without cross-jumping.</p>

<p>Enabled at levels -O2, -O3, -Os.</p>

<p>-fauto-inc-dec Combine increments or decrements of
addresses with memory accesses. This pass is always skipped
on architectures that do not have instructions to support
this. Enabled by default at -O and higher on architectures
that support this.</p>

<p>-fdce Perform dead code elimination (DCE) on RTL.
Enabled by default at -O and higher.</p>

<p>-fdse Perform dead store elimination (DSE) on RTL.
Enabled by default at -O and higher.</p>

<p>-fif-conversion Attempt to transform conditional jumps
into branch-less equivalents. This include use of
conditional moves, min, max, set flags and abs instructions,
and some tricks doable by standard arithmetics. The use of
conditional execution on chips where it is available is
controlled by &quot;if-conversion2&quot;.</p>

<p>Enabled at levels -O, -O2, -O3, -Os.</p>

<p>-fif-conversion2 Use conditional execution (where
available) to transform conditional jumps into branch-less
equivalents.</p>

<p>Enabled at levels -O, -O2, -O3, -Os.</p>

<p>-fdelete-null-pointer-checks Use global dataflow
analysis to identify and eliminate useless checks for null
pointers. The compiler assumes that dereferencing a null
pointer would have halted the program. If a pointer is
checked after it has already been dereferenced, it cannot be
null.</p>

<p>In some environments, this assumption is not true, and
programs can safely dereference null pointers. Use
-fno-delete-null-pointer-checks to disable this optimization
for programs which depend on that behavior.</p>

<p>Enabled at levels -O2, -O3, -Os.</p>

<p>-fexpensive-optimizations Perform a number of minor
optimizations that are relatively expensive.</p>

<p>Enabled at levels -O2, -O3, -Os.</p>

<p>-foptimize-register-move -fregmove Attempt to reassign
register numbers in move instructions and as operands of
other simple instructions in order to maximize the amount of
register tying. This is especially helpful on machines with
two-operand instructions.</p>

<p>Note -fregmove and -foptimize-register-move are the same
optimization.</p>

<p>Enabled at levels -O2, -O3, -Os.</p>

<p>-fira-algorithm=algorithm Use specified coloring
algorithm for the integrated register allocator. The
algorithm argument should be &quot;priority&quot; or
&quot;CB&quot;. The first algorithm specifies Chows priority
coloring, the second one specifies Chaitin-Briggs coloring.
The second algorithm can be unimplemented for some
architectures. If it is implemented, it is the default
because Chaitin-Briggs coloring as a rule generates a better
code.</p>

<p>-fira-region=region Use specified regions for the
integrated register allocator. The region argument should be
one of &quot;all&quot;, &quot;mixed&quot;, or
&quot;one&quot;. The first value means using all loops as
register allocation regions, the second value which is the
default means using all loops except for loops with small
register pressure as the regions, and third one means using
all function as a single region. The first value can give
best result for machines with small size and irregular
register set, the third one results in faster and generates
decent code and the smallest size code, and the default
value usually give the best results in most cases and for
most architectures.</p>

<p>-fira-coalesce Do optimistic register coalescing. This
option might be profitable for architectures with big
regular register files.</p>

<p>-fno-ira-share-save-slots Switch off sharing stack slots
used for saving call used hard registers living through a
call. Each hard register will get a separate stack slot and
as a result function stack frame will be bigger.</p>

<p>-fno-ira-share-spill-slots Switch off sharing stack
slots allocated for pseudo-registers. Each pseudo-register
which did not get a hard register will get a separate stack
slot and as a result function stack frame will be
bigger.</p>

<p>-fira-verbose=n Set up how verbose dump file for the
integrated register allocator will be. Default value is 5.
If the value is greater or equal to 10, the dump file will
be stderr as if the value were n minus 10.</p>

<p>-fdelayed-branch If supported for the target machine,
attempt to reorder instructions to exploit instruction slots
available after delayed branch instructions.</p>

<p>Enabled at levels -O, -O2, -O3, -Os.</p>

<p>-fschedule-insns If supported for the target machine,
attempt to reorder instructions to eliminate execution
stalls due to required data being unavailable. This helps
machines that have slow floating point or memory load
instructions by allowing other instructions to be issued
until the result of the load or floating point instruction
is required.</p>

<p>Enabled at levels -O2, -O3, -Os.</p>

<p>-fschedule-insns2 Similar to -fschedule-insns, but
requests an additional pass of instruction scheduling after
register allocation has been done. This is especially useful
on machines with a relatively small number of registers and
where memory load instructions take more than one cycle.</p>

<p>Enabled at levels -O2, -O3, -Os.</p>

<p>-fno-sched-interblock Dont schedule instructions across
basic blocks. This is normally enabled by default when
scheduling before register allocation, i.e. with
-fschedule-insns or at -O2 or higher.</p>

<p>-fno-sched-spec Don t allow speculative motion of
non-load instructions. This is normally enabled by default
when scheduling before register allocation, i.e. with
-fschedule-insns or at -O2 or higher.</p>

<p>-fsched-spec-load Allow speculative motion of some load
instructions. This only makes sense when scheduling before
register allocation, i.e. with -fschedule-insns or at -O2 or
higher.</p>

<p>-fsched-spec-load-dangerous Allow speculative motion of
more load instructions. This only makes sense when
scheduling before register allocation, i.e. with
-fschedule-insns or at -O2 or higher.</p>

<p>-fsched-stalled-insns -fsched-stalled-insns=n Define how
many insns (if any) can be moved prematurely from the queue
of stalled insns into the ready list, during the second
scheduling pass. -fno-sched-stalled-insns means that no
insns will be moved prematurely, -fsched-stalled-insns=0
means there is no limit on how many queued insns can be
moved prematurely. -fsched-stalled-insns without a value is
equivalent to -fsched-stalled-insns=1.</p>

<p>-fsched-stalled-insns-dep -fsched-stalled-insns-dep=n
Define how many insn groups (cycles) will be examined for a
dependency on a stalled insn that is candidate for premature
removal from the queue of stalled insns. This has an effect
only during the second scheduling pass, and only if
-fsched-stalled-insns is used. -fno-sched-stalled-insns-dep
is equivalent to -fsched-stalled-insns-dep=0.
-fsched-stalled-insns-dep without a value is equivalent to
-fsched-stalled-insns-dep=1.</p>

<p>-fsched2-use-superblocks When scheduling after register
allocation, do use superblock scheduling algorithm.
Superblock scheduling allows motion across basic block
boundaries resulting on faster schedules. This option is
experimental, as not all machine descriptions used by GCC
model the CPU closely enough to avoid unreliable results
from the algorithm.</p>

<p>This only makes sense when scheduling after register
allocation, i.e. with -fschedule-insns2 or at -O2 or
higher.</p>

<p>-fsched2-use-traces Use -fsched2-use-superblocks
algorithm when scheduling after register allocation and
additionally perform code duplication in order to increase
the size of superblocks using tracer pass. See -ftracer for
details on trace formation.</p>

<p>This mode should produce faster but significantly longer
programs. Also without -fbranch-probabilities the traces
constructed may not match the reality and hurt the
performance. This only makes sense when scheduling after
register allocation, i.e. with -fschedule-insns2 or at -O2
or higher.</p>

<p>-fsee Eliminate redundant sign extension instructions
and move the non- redundant ones to optimal placement using
lazy code motion (LCM).</p>

<p>-freschedule-modulo-scheduled-loops The modulo
scheduling comes before the traditional scheduling, if a
loop was modulo scheduled we may want to prevent the later
scheduling passes from changing its schedule, we use this
option to control that.</p>

<p>-fselective-scheduling Schedule instructions using
selective scheduling algorithm. Selective scheduling runs
instead of the first scheduler pass.</p>

<p>-fselective-scheduling2 Schedule instructions using
selective scheduling algorithm. Selective scheduling runs
instead of the second scheduler pass.</p>

<p>-fsel-sched-pipelining Enable software pipelining of
innermost loops during selective scheduling. This option has
no effect until one of -fselective-scheduling or
-fselective-scheduling2 is turned on.</p>

<p>-fsel-sched-pipelining-outer-loops When pipelining loops
during selective scheduling, also pipeline outer loops. This
option has no effect until -fsel-sched-pipelining is turned
on.</p>

<p>-fcaller-saves Enable values to be allocated in
registers that will be clobbered by function calls, by
emitting extra instructions to save and restore the
registers around such calls. Such allocation is done only
when it seems to result in better code than would otherwise
be produced.</p>

<p>This option is always enabled by default on certain
machines, usually those which have no call-preserved
registers to use instead.</p>

<p>Enabled at levels -O2, -O3, -Os.</p>

<p>-fconserve-stack Attempt to minimize stack usage. The
compiler will attempt to use less stack space, even if that
makes the program slower. This option implies setting the
large-stack-frame parameter to 100 and the
large-stack-frame-growth parameter to 400.</p>

<p>-ftree-reassoc Perform reassociation on trees. This flag
is enabled by default at -O and higher.</p>

<p>-ftree-pre Perform partial redundancy elimination (PRE)
on trees. This flag is enabled by default at -O2 and
-O3.</p>

<p>-ftree-fre Perform full redundancy elimination (FRE) on
trees. The difference between FRE and PRE is that FRE only
considers expressions that are computed on all paths leading
to the redundant computation. This analysis is faster than
PRE, though it exposes fewer redundancies. This flag is
enabled by default at -O and higher.</p>

<p>-ftree-copy-prop Perform copy propagation on trees. This
pass eliminates unnecessary copy operations. This flag is
enabled by default at -O and higher.</p>

<p>-fipa-pure-const Discover which functions are pure or
constant. Enabled by default at -O and higher.</p>

<p>-fipa-reference Discover which static variables do not
escape cannot escape the compilation unit. Enabled by
default at -O and higher.</p>

<p>-fipa-struct-reorg Perform structure reorganization
optimization, that change C-like structures layout in order
to better utilize spatial locality. This transformation is
affective for programs containing arrays of structures.
Available in two compilation modes: profile-based (enabled
with -fprofile-generate) or static (which uses built-in
heuristics). Require -fipa-type-escape to provide the safety
of this transformation. It works only in whole program mode,
so it requires -fwhole-program and -combine to be enabled.
Structures considered cold by this transformation are not
affected (see --param
struct-reorg-cold-struct-ratio=value).</p>

<p>With this flag, the program debug info reflects a new
structure layout.</p>

<p>-fipa-pta Perform interprocedural pointer analysis. This
option is experimental and does not affect generated
code.</p>

<p>-fipa-cp Perform interprocedural constant propagation.
This optimization analyzes the program to determine when
values passed to functions are constants and then optimizes
accordingly. This optimization can substantially increase
performance if the application has constants passed to
functions. This flag is enabled by default at -O2, -Os and
-O3.</p>

<p>-fipa-cp-clone Perform function cloning to make
interprocedural constant propagation stronger. When enabled,
interprocedural constant propagation will perform function
cloning when externally visible function can be called with
constant arguments. Because this optimization can create
multiple copies of functions, it may significantly increase
code size (see --param ipcp-unit-growth=value). This flag is
enabled by default at -O3.</p>

<p>-fipa-matrix-reorg Perform matrix flattening and
transposing. Matrix flattening tries to replace a
m-dimensional matrix with its equivalent n-dimensional
matrix, where n &lt; m. This reduces the level of
indirection needed for accessing the elements of the matrix.
The second optimization is matrix transposing that attempts
to change the order of the matrixs dimensions in order to
improve cache locality. Both optimizations need the
-fwhole-program flag. Transposing is enabled only if
profiling information is available.</p>

<p>-ftree-sink Perform forward store motion on trees. This
flag is enabled by default at -O and higher.</p>

<p>-ftree-ccp Perform sparse conditional constant
propagation (CCP) on trees. This pass only operates on local
scalar variables and is enabled by default at -O and
higher.</p>

<p>-ftree-switch-conversion Perform conversion of simple
initializations in a switch to initializations from a scalar
array. This flag is enabled by default at -O2 and
higher.</p>

<p>-ftree-dce Perform dead code elimination (DCE) on trees.
This flag is enabled by default at -O and higher.</p>

<p>-ftree-builtin-call-dce Perform conditional dead code
elimination (DCE) for calls to builtin functions that may
set &quot;errno&quot; but are otherwise side- effect free.
This flag is enabled by default at -O2 and higher if -Os is
not also specified.</p>

<p>-ftree-dominator-opts Perform a variety of simple scalar
cleanups (constant/copy propagation, redundancy elimination,
range propagation and expression simplification) based on a
dominator tree traversal. This also performs jump threading
(to reduce jumps to jumps). This flag is enabled by default
at -O and higher.</p>

<p>-ftree-dse Perform dead store elimination (DSE) on
trees. A dead store is a store into a memory location which
will later be overwritten by another store without any
intervening loads. In this case the earlier store can be
deleted. This flag is enabled by default at -O and
higher.</p>

<p>-ftree-ch Perform loop header copying on trees. This is
beneficial since it increases effectiveness of code motion
optimizations. It also saves one jump. This flag is enabled
by default at -O and higher. It is not enabled for -Os,
since it usually increases code size.</p>

<p>-ftree-loop-optimize Perform loop optimizations on
trees. This flag is enabled by default at -O and higher.</p>

<p>-ftree-loop-linear Perform linear loop transformations
on tree. This flag can improve cache performance and allow
further loop optimizations to take place.</p>

<p>-floop-interchange Perform loop interchange
transformations on loops. Interchanging two nested loops
switches the inner and outer loops. For example, given a
loop like:</p>

<p>DO J = 1, M DO I = 1, N A(J, I) = A(J, I) * C ENDDO
ENDDO</p>

<p>loop interchange will transform the loop as if the user
had written:</p>

<p>DO I = 1, N DO J = 1, M A(J, I) = A(J, I) * C ENDDO
ENDDO</p>

<p>which can be beneficial when &quot;N&quot; is larger
than the caches, because in Fortran, the elements of an
array are stored in memory contiguously by column, and the
original loop iterates over rows, potentially creating at
each access a cache miss. This optimization applies to all
the languages supported by GCC and is not limited to
Fortran. To use this code transformation, GCC has to be
configured with --with-ppl and --with-cloog to enable the
Graphite loop transformation infrastructure.</p>

<p>-floop-strip-mine Perform loop strip mining
transformations on loops. Strip mining splits a loop into
two nested loops. The outer loop has strides equal to the
strip size and the inner loop has strides of the original
loop within a strip. For example, given a loop like:</p>

<p>DO I = 1, N A(I) = A(I) + C ENDDO</p>

<p>loop strip mining will transform the loop as if the user
had written:</p>

<p>DO II = 1, N, 4 DO I = II, min (II + 3, N) A(I) = A(I) +
C ENDDO ENDDO</p>

<p>This optimization applies to all the languages supported
by GCC and is not limited to Fortran. To use this code
transformation, GCC has to be configured with --with-ppl and
--with-cloog to enable the Graphite loop transformation
infrastructure.</p>

<p>-floop-block Perform loop blocking transformations on
loops. Blocking strip mines each loop in the loop nest such
that the memory accesses of the element loops fit inside
caches. For example, given a loop like:</p>

<p>DO I = 1, N DO J = 1, M A(J, I) = B(I) + C(J) ENDDO
ENDDO</p>

<p>loop blocking will transform the loop as if the user had
written:</p>

<p>DO II = 1, N, 64 DO JJ = 1, M, 64 DO I = II, min (II +
63, N) DO J = JJ, min (JJ + 63, M) A(J, I) = B(I) + C(J)
ENDDO ENDDO ENDDO ENDDO</p>

<p>which can be beneficial when &quot;M&quot; is larger
than the caches, because the innermost loop will iterate
over a smaller amount of data that can be kept in the
caches. This optimization applies to all the languages
supported by GCC and is not limited to Fortran. To use this
code transformation, GCC has to be configured with
--with-ppl and --with-cloog to enable the Graphite loop
transformation infrastructure.</p>

<p>-fcheck-data-deps Compare the results of several data
dependence analyzers. This option is used for debugging the
data dependence analyzers.</p>

<p>-ftree-loop-distribution Perform loop distribution. This
flag can improve cache performance on big loop bodies and
allow further loop optimizations, like parallelization or
vectorization, to take place. For example, the loop</p>

<p>DO I = 1, N A(I) = B(I) + C D(I) = E(I) * F ENDDO</p>

<p>is transformed to</p>

<p>DO I = 1, N A(I) = B(I) + C ENDDO DO I = 1, N D(I) =
E(I) * F ENDDO</p>

<p>-ftree-loop-im Perform loop invariant motion on trees.
This pass moves only invariants that would be hard to handle
at RTL level (function calls, operations that expand to
nontrivial sequences of insns). With -funswitch-loops it
also moves operands of conditions that are invariant out of
the loop, so that we can use just trivial invariantness
analysis in loop unswitching. The pass also includes store
motion.</p>

<p>-ftree-loop-ivcanon Create a canonical counter for
number of iterations in the loop for that determining number
of iterations requires complicated analysis. Later
optimizations then may determine the number easily. Useful
especially in connection with unrolling.</p>

<p>-fivopts Perform induction variable optimizations
(strength reduction, induction variable merging and
induction variable elimination) on trees.</p>

<p>-ftree-parallelize-loops=n Parallelize loops, i.e.,
split their iteration space to run in n threads. This is
only possible for loops whose iterations are independent and
can be arbitrarily reordered. The optimization is only
profitable on multiprocessor machines, for loops that are
CPU- intensive, rather than constrained e.g. by memory
bandwidth. This option implies -pthread, and thus is only
supported on targets that have support for -pthread.</p>

<p>-ftree-sra Perform scalar replacement of aggregates.
This pass replaces structure references with scalars to
prevent committing structures to memory too early. This flag
is enabled by default at -O and higher.</p>

<p>-ftree-copyrename Perform copy renaming on trees. This
pass attempts to rename compiler temporaries to other
variables at copy locations, usually resulting in variable
names which more closely resemble the original variables.
This flag is enabled by default at -O and higher.</p>

<p>-ftree-coalesce-inlined-vars Permit the copyrename pass
to subject inlined variables to coalescing into other
variables. This may harm debug information of such inlined
variables, but it will keep variables of the main function
apart from each other, such that they are more likely to
contain the expected values in a debugging session.</p>

<p>-ftree-coalesce-vars Permit the copyrename pass to
subject all variables to SSA coalescing. This may severely
limit the ability to debug an optimized program compiled
without -fvar-tracking-assignments. In the negated form,
this flag prevents SSA coalescing of user variables,
including inlined ones.</p>

<p>-ftree-ter Perform temporary expression replacement
during the SSA-&gt;normal phase. Single use/single def
temporaries are replaced at their use location with their
defining expression. This results in non- GIMPLE code, but
gives the expanders much more complex trees to work on
resulting in better RTL generation. This is enabled by
default at -O and higher.</p>

<p>-ftree-vectorize Perform loop vectorization on trees.
This flag is enabled by default at -O3.</p>

<p>-ftree-vect-loop-version Perform loop versioning when
doing loop vectorization on trees. When a loop appears to be
vectorizable except that data alignment or data dependence
cannot be determined at compile time then vectorized and
non-vectorized versions of the loop are generated along with
runtime checks for alignment or dependence to control which
version is executed. This option is enabled by default
except at level -Os where it is disabled.</p>

<p>-fvect-cost-model Enable cost model for
vectorization.</p>

<p>-ftree-vrp Perform Value Range Propagation on trees.
This is similar to the constant propagation pass, but
instead of values, ranges of values are propagated. This
allows the optimizers to remove unnecessary range checks
like array bound checks and null pointer checks. This is
enabled by default at -O2 and higher. Null pointer check
elimination is only done if -fdelete-null-pointer-checks is
enabled.</p>

<p>-ftracer Perform tail duplication to enlarge superblock
size. This transformation simplifies the control flow of the
function allowing other optimizations to do better job.</p>

<p>-funroll-loops Unroll loops whose number of iterations
can be determined at compile time or upon entry to the loop.
-funroll-loops implies -frerun-cse-after-loop. This option
makes code larger, and may or may not make it run
faster.</p>

<p>-funroll-all-loops Unroll all loops, even if their
number of iterations is uncertain when the loop is entered.
This usually makes programs run more slowly.
-funroll-all-loops implies the same options as
-funroll-loops,</p>

<p>-fsplit-ivs-in-unroller Enables expressing of values of
induction variables in later iterations of the unrolled loop
using the value in the first iteration. This breaks long
dependency chains, thus improving efficiency of the
scheduling passes.</p>

<p>Combination of -fweb and CSE is often sufficient to
obtain the same effect. However in cases the loop body is
more complicated than a single basic block, this is not
reliable. It also does not work at all on some of the
architectures due to restrictions in the CSE pass.</p>

<p>This optimization is enabled by default.</p>

<p>-fvariable-expansion-in-unroller With this option, the
compiler will create multiple copies of some local variables
when unrolling a loop which can result in superior code.</p>

<p>-fpredictive-commoning Perform predictive commoning
optimization, i.e., reusing computations (especially memory
loads and stores) performed in previous iterations of
loops.</p>

<p>This option is enabled at level -O3.</p>

<p>-fprefetch-loop-arrays If supported by the target
machine, generate instructions to prefetch memory to improve
the performance of loops that access large arrays.</p>

<p>This option may generate better or worse code; results
are highly dependent on the structure of loops within the
source code.</p>

<p>Disabled at level -Os.</p>

<p>-fno-peephole -fno-peephole2 Disable any
machine-specific peephole optimizations. The difference
between -fno-peephole and -fno-peephole2 is in how they are
implemented in the compiler; some targets use one, some use
the other, a few use both.</p>

<p>-fpeephole is enabled by default. -fpeephole2 enabled at
levels -O2, -O3, -Os.</p>

<p>-fno-guess-branch-probability Do not guess branch
probabilities using heuristics.</p>

<p>GCC will use heuristics to guess branch probabilities if
they are not provided by profiling feedback
(-fprofile-arcs). These heuristics are based on the control
flow graph. If some branch probabilities are specified by
__builtin_expect, then the heuristics will be used to guess
branch probabilities for the rest of the control flow graph,
taking the __builtin_expect info into account. The
interactions between the heuristics and __builtin_expect can
be complex, and in some cases, it may be useful to disable
the heuristics so that the effects of __builtin_expect are
easier to understand.</p>

<p>The default is -fguess-branch-probability at levels -O,
-O2, -O3, -Os.</p>

<p>-freorder-blocks Reorder basic blocks in the compiled
function in order to reduce number of taken branches and
improve code locality.</p>

<p>Enabled at levels -O2, -O3.</p>

<p>-freorder-blocks-and-partition In addition to reordering
basic blocks in the compiled function, in order to reduce
number of taken branches, partitions hot and cold basic
blocks into separate sections of the assembly and .o files,
to improve paging and cache locality performance.</p>

<p>This optimization is automatically turned off in the
presence of exception handling, for linkonce sections, for
functions with a user-defined section attribute and on any
architecture that does not support named sections.</p>

<p>-freorder-functions Reorder functions in the object file
in order to improve code locality. This is implemented by
using special subsections &quot;.text.hot&quot; for most
frequently executed functions and &quot;.text.unlikely&quot;
for unlikely executed functions. Reordering is done by the
linker so object file format must support named sections and
linker must place them in a reasonable way.</p>

<p>Also profile feedback must be available in to make this
option effective. See -fprofile-arcs for details.</p>

<p>Enabled at levels -O2, -O3, -Os.</p>

<p>-fstrict-aliasing Allow the compiler to assume the
strictest aliasing rules applicable to the language being
compiled. For C (and C++), this activates optimizations
based on the type of expressions. In particular, an object
of one type is assumed never to reside at the same address
as an object of a different type, unless the types are
almost the same. For example, an &quot;unsigned int&quot;
can alias an &quot;int&quot;, but not a &quot;void*&quot; or
a &quot;double&quot;. A character type may alias any other
type.</p>

<p>Pay special attention to code like this:</p>

<p>union a_union { int i; double d; };</p>

<p>int f() { union a_union t; t.d = 3.0; return t.i; }</p>

<p>The practice of reading from a different union member
than the one most recently written to (called
&quot;type-punning&quot;) is common. Even with
-fstrict-aliasing, type-punning is allowed, provided the
memory is accessed through the union type. So, the code
above will work as expected. However, this code might
not:</p>

<p>int f() { union a_union t; int* ip; t.d = 3.0; ip =
&amp;t.i; return *ip; }</p>

<p>Similarly, access by taking the address, casting the
resulting pointer and dereferencing the result has undefined
behavior, even if the cast uses a union type, e.g.:</p>

<p>int f() { double d = 3.0; return ((union a_union *)
&amp;d)-&gt;i; }</p>

<p>The -fstrict-aliasing option is enabled at levels -O2,
-O3, -Os.</p>

<p>-fstrict-overflow Allow the compiler to assume strict
signed overflow rules, depending on the language being
compiled. For C (and C++) this means that overflow when
doing arithmetic with signed numbers is undefined, which
means that the compiler may assume that it will not happen.
This permits various optimizations. For example, the
compiler will assume that an expression like &quot;i + 10
&gt; i&quot; will always be true for signed &quot;i&quot;.
This assumption is only valid if signed overflow is
undefined, as the expression is false if &quot;i + 10&quot;
overflows when using twos complement arithmetic. When this
option is in effect any attempt to determine whether an
operation on signed numbers will overflow must be written
carefully to not actually involve overflow.</p>

<p>This option also allows the compiler to assume strict
pointer semantics: given a pointer to an object, if adding
an offset to that pointer does not produce a pointer to the
same object, the addition is undefined. This permits the
compiler to conclude that &quot;p + u &gt; p&quot; is always
true for a pointer &quot;p&quot; and unsigned integer
&quot;u&quot;. This assumption is only valid because pointer
wraparound is undefined, as the expression is false if
&quot;p + u&quot; overflows using twos complement
arithmetic.</p>

<p>See also the -fwrapv option. Using -fwrapv means that
integer signed overflow is fully defined: it wraps. When
-fwrapv is used, there is no difference between
-fstrict-overflow and -fno-strict-overflow for integers.
With -fwrapv certain types of overflow are permitted. For
example, if the compiler gets an overflow when doing
arithmetic on constants, the overflowed value can still be
used with -fwrapv, but not otherwise.</p>

<p>The -fstrict-overflow option is enabled at levels -O2,
-O3, -Os.</p>

<p>-falign-functions -falign-functions=n Align the start of
functions to the next power-of-two greater than n, skipping
up to n bytes. For instance, -falign-functions=32 aligns
functions to the next 32-byte boundary, but
-falign-functions=24 would align to the next 32-byte
boundary only if this can be done by skipping 23 bytes or
less.</p>

<p>-fno-align-functions and -falign-functions=1 are
equivalent and mean that functions will not be aligned.</p>

<p>Some assemblers only support this flag when n is a power
of two; in that case, it is rounded up.</p>

<p>If n is not specified or is zero, use a
machine-dependent default.</p>

<p>Enabled at levels -O2, -O3.</p>

<p>-falign-labels -falign-labels=n Align all branch targets
to a power-of-two boundary, skipping up to n bytes like
-falign-functions. This option can easily make code slower,
because it must insert dummy operations for when the branch
target is reached in the usual flow of the code.</p>

<p>-fno-align-labels and -falign-labels=1 are equivalent
and mean that labels will not be aligned.</p>

<p>If -falign-loops or -falign-jumps are applicable and are
greater than this value, then their values are used
instead.</p>

<p>If n is not specified or is zero, use a
machine-dependent default which is very likely to be 1,
meaning no alignment.</p>

<p>Enabled at levels -O2, -O3.</p>

<p>-falign-loops -falign-loops=n Align loops to a
power-of-two boundary, skipping up to n bytes like
-falign-functions. The hope is that the loop will be
executed many times, which will make up for any execution of
the dummy operations.</p>

<p>-fno-align-loops and -falign-loops=1 are equivalent and
mean that loops will not be aligned.</p>

<p>If n is not specified or is zero, use a
machine-dependent default.</p>

<p>Enabled at levels -O2, -O3.</p>

<p>-falign-jumps -falign-jumps=n Align branch targets to a
power-of-two boundary, for branch targets where the targets
can only be reached by jumping, skipping up to n bytes like
-falign-functions. In this case, no dummy operations need be
executed.</p>

<p>-fno-align-jumps and -falign-jumps=1 are equivalent and
mean that loops will not be aligned.</p>

<p>If n is not specified or is zero, use a
machine-dependent default.</p>

<p>Enabled at levels -O2, -O3.</p>

<p>-funit-at-a-time This option is left for compatibility
reasons. -funit-at-a-time has no effect, while
-fno-unit-at-a-time implies -fno-toplevel-reorder and
-fno-section-anchors.</p>

<p>Enabled by default.</p>

<p>-fno-toplevel-reorder Do not reorder top-level
functions, variables, and &quot;asm&quot; statements. Output
them in the same order that they appear in the input file.
When this option is used, unreferenced static variables will
not be removed. This option is intended to support existing
code which relies on a particular ordering. For new code, it
is better to use attributes.</p>

<p>Enabled at level -O0. When disabled explicitly, it also
imply -fno-section-anchors that is otherwise enabled at -O0
on some targets.</p>

<p>-fweb Constructs webs as commonly used for register
allocation purposes and assign each web individual pseudo
register. This allows the register allocation pass to
operate on pseudos directly, but also strengthens several
other optimization passes, such as CSE, loop optimizer and
trivial dead code remover. It can, however, make debugging
impossible, since variables will no longer stay in a
&quot;home register&quot;.</p>

<p>Enabled by default with -funroll-loops.</p>

<p>-fwhole-program Assume that the current compilation unit
represents whole program being compiled. All public
functions and variables with the exception of
&quot;main&quot; and those merged by attribute
&quot;externally_visible&quot; become static functions and
in a affect gets more aggressively optimized by
interprocedural optimizers. While this option is equivalent
to proper use of &quot;static&quot; keyword for programs
consisting of single file, in combination with option
--combine this flag can be used to compile most of smaller
scale C programs since the functions and variables become
local for the whole combined compilation unit, not for the
single source file itself.</p>

<p>This option is not supported for Fortran programs.</p>

<p>-fcprop-registers After register allocation and
post-register allocation instruction splitting, we perform a
copy-propagation pass to try to reduce scheduling
dependencies and occasionally eliminate the copy.</p>

<p>Enabled at levels -O, -O2, -O3, -Os.</p>

<p>-fprofile-correction Profiles collected using an
instrumented binary for multi-threaded programs may be
inconsistent due to missed counter updates. When this option
is specified, GCC will use heuristics to correct or smooth
out such inconsistencies. By default, GCC will emit an error
message when an inconsistent profile is detected.</p>

<p>-fprofile-dir=path Set the directory to search the
profile data files in to path. This option affects only the
profile data generated by -fprofile-generate,
-ftest-coverage, -fprofile-arcs and used by -fprofile-use
and -fbranch-probabilities and its related options. By
default, GCC will use the current directory as path thus the
profile data file will appear in the same directory as the
object file.</p>

<p>-fprofile-generate -fprofile-generate=path Enable
options usually used for instrumenting application to
produce profile useful for later recompilation with profile
feedback based optimization. You must use -fprofile-generate
both when compiling and when linking your program.</p>

<p>The following options are enabled:
&quot;-fprofile-arcs&quot;, &quot;-fprofile-values&quot;,
&quot;-fvpt&quot;.</p>

<p>If path is specified, GCC will look at the path to find
the profile feedback data files. See -fprofile-dir.</p>

<p>-fprofile-use -fprofile-use=path Enable profile feedback
directed optimizations, and optimizations generally
profitable only with profile feedback available.</p>

<p>The following options are enabled:
&quot;-fbranch-probabilities&quot;, &quot;-fvpt&quot;,
&quot;-funroll-loops&quot;, &quot;-fpeel-loops&quot;,
&quot;-ftracer&quot;</p>

<p>By default, GCC emits an error message if the feedback
profiles do not match the source code. This error can be
turned into a warning by using -Wcoverage-mismatch. Note
this may result in poorly optimized code.</p>

<p>If path is specified, GCC will look at the path to find
the profile feedback data files. See -fprofile-dir.</p>

<p>The following options control compiler behavior
regarding floating point arithmetic. These options trade off
between speed and correctness. All must be specifically
enabled.</p>

<p>-ffloat-store Do not store floating point variables in
registers, and inhibit other options that might change
whether a floating point value is taken from a register or
memory.</p>

<p>This option prevents undesirable excess precision on
machines such as the 68000 where the floating registers (of
the 68881) keep more precision than a &quot;double&quot; is
supposed to have. Similarly for the x86 architecture. For
most programs, the excess precision does only good, but a
few programs rely on the precise definition of IEEE floating
point. Use -ffloat-store for such programs, after modifying
them to store all pertinent intermediate computations into
variables.</p>

<p>-ffast-math Sets -fno-math-errno,
-funsafe-math-optimizations, -ffinite-math-only,
-fno-rounding-math, -fno-signaling-nans and
-fcx-limited-range.</p>

<p>This option causes the preprocessor macro
&quot;__FAST_MATH__&quot; to be defined.</p>

<p>This option is not turned on by any -O option since it
can result in incorrect output for programs which depend on
an exact implementation of IEEE or ISO rules/specifications
for math functions. It may, however, yield faster code for
programs that do not require the guarantees of these
specifications.</p>

<p>-fno-math-errno Do not set ERRNO after calling math
functions that are executed with a single instruction, e.g.,
sqrt. A program that relies on IEEE exceptions for math
error handling may want to use this flag for speed while
maintaining IEEE arithmetic compatibility.</p>

<p>This option is not turned on by any -O option since it
can result in incorrect output for programs which depend on
an exact implementation of IEEE or ISO rules/specifications
for math functions. It may, however, yield faster code for
programs that do not require the guarantees of these
specifications.</p>

<p>The default is -fmath-errno.</p>

<p>On Darwin systems, the math library never sets
&quot;errno&quot;. There is therefore no reason for the
compiler to consider the possibility that it might, and
-fno-math-errno is the default.</p>

<p>-funsafe-math-optimizations Allow optimizations for
floating-point arithmetic that (a) assume that arguments and
results are valid and (b) may violate IEEE or ANSI
standards. When used at link-time, it may include libraries
or startup files that change the default FPU control word or
other similar optimizations.</p>

<p>This option is not turned on by any -O option since it
can result in incorrect output for programs which depend on
an exact implementation of IEEE or ISO rules/specifications
for math functions. It may, however, yield faster code for
programs that do not require the guarantees of these
specifications. Enables -fno-signed-zeros,
-fno-trapping-math, -fassociative-math and
-freciprocal-math.</p>

<p>The default is -fno-unsafe-math-optimizations.</p>

<p>-fassociative-math Allow re-association of operands in
series of floating-point operations. This violates the ISO C
and C++ language standard by possibly changing computation
result. NOTE: re-ordering may change the sign of zero as
well as ignore NaNs and inhibit or create underflow or
overflow (and thus cannot be used on a code which relies on
rounding behavior like &quot;(x + 2**52) - 2**52)&quot;. May
also reorder floating-point comparisons and thus may not be
used when ordered comparisons are required. This option
requires that both -fno-signed-zeros and -fno-trapping-math
be in effect. Moreover, it doesnt make much sense with
-frounding-math.</p>

<p>The default is -fno-associative-math.</p>

<p>-freciprocal-math Allow the reciprocal of a value to be
used instead of dividing by the value if this enables
optimizations. For example &quot;x / y&quot; can be replaced
with &quot;x * (1/y)&quot; which is useful if
&quot;(1/y)&quot; is subject to common subexpression
elimination. Note that this loses precision and increases
the number of flops operating on the value.</p>

<p>The default is -fno-reciprocal-math.</p>

<p>-ffinite-math-only Allow optimizations for
floating-point arithmetic that assume that arguments and
results are not NaNs or +-Infs.</p>

<p>This option is not turned on by any -O option since it
can result in incorrect output for programs which depend on
an exact implementation of IEEE or ISO rules/specifications
for math functions. It may, however, yield faster code for
programs that do not require the guarantees of these
specifications.</p>

<p>The default is -fno-finite-math-only.</p>

<p>-fno-signed-zeros Allow optimizations for floating point
arithmetic that ignore the signedness of zero. IEEE
arithmetic specifies the behavior of distinct +0.0 and -0.0
values, which then prohibits simplification of expressions
such as x+0.0 or 0.0*x (even with -ffinite-math-only). This
option implies that the sign of a zero result isnt
significant.</p>

<p>The default is -fsigned-zeros.</p>

<p>-fno-trapping-math Compile code assuming that
floating-point operations cannot generate user-visible
traps. These traps include division by zero, overflow,
underflow, inexact result and invalid operation. This option
requires that -fno-signaling-nans be in effect. Setting this
option may allow faster code if one relies on
&quot;non-stop&quot; IEEE arithmetic, for example.</p>

<p>This option should never be turned on by any -O option
since it can result in incorrect output for programs which
depend on an exact implementation of IEEE or ISO
rules/specifications for math functions.</p>

<p>The default is -ftrapping-math.</p>

<p>-frounding-math Disable transformations and
optimizations that assume default floating point rounding
behavior. This is round-to-zero for all floating point to
integer conversions, and round-to-nearest for all other
arithmetic truncations. This option should be specified for
programs that change the FP rounding mode dynamically, or
that may be executed with a non-default rounding mode. This
option disables constant folding of floating point
expressions at compile-time (which may be affected by
rounding mode) and arithmetic transformations that are
unsafe in the presence of sign-dependent rounding modes.</p>

<p>The default is -fno-rounding-math.</p>

<p>This option is experimental and does not currently
guarantee to disable all GCC optimizations that are affected
by rounding mode. Future versions of GCC may provide finer
control of this setting using C99 s &quot;FENV_ACCESS&quot;
pragma. This command line option will be used to specify the
default state for &quot;FENV_ACCESS&quot;.</p>

<p>-frtl-abstract-sequences It is a size optimization
method. This option is to find identical sequences of code,
which can be turned into pseudo-procedures and then replace
all occurrences with calls to the newly created subroutine.
It is kind of an opposite of -finline-functions. This
optimization runs at RTL level.</p>

<p>-fsignaling-nans Compile code assuming that IEEE
signaling NaNs may generate user- visible traps during
floating-point operations. Setting this option disables
optimizations that may change the number of exceptions
visible with signaling NaNs. This option implies
-ftrapping-math.</p>

<p>This option causes the preprocessor macro
&quot;__SUPPORT_SNAN__&quot; to be defined.</p>

<p>The default is -fno-signaling-nans.</p>

<p>This option is experimental and does not currently
guarantee to disable all GCC optimizations that affect
signaling NaN behavior.</p>

<p>-fsingle-precision-constant Treat floating point
constant as single precision constant instead of implicitly
converting it to double precision constant.</p>

<p>-fcx-limited-range When enabled, this option states that
a range reduction step is not needed when performing complex
division. Also, there is no checking whether the result of a
complex multiplication or division is &quot;NaN +
I*NaN&quot;, with an attempt to rescue the situation in that
case. The default is -fno-cx-limited-range, but is enabled
by -ffast-math.</p>

<p>This option controls the default setting of the ISO C99
&quot;CX_LIMITED_RANGE&quot; pragma. Nevertheless, the
option applies to all languages.</p>

<p>-fcx-fortran-rules Complex multiplication and division
follow Fortran rules. Range reduction is done as part of
complex division, but there is no checking whether the
result of a complex multiplication or division is &quot;NaN
+ I*NaN&quot;, with an attempt to rescue the situation in
that case.</p>

<p>The default is -fno-cx-fortran-rules.</p>

<p>The following options control optimizations that may
improve performance, but are not enabled by any -O options.
This section includes experimental options that may produce
broken code.</p>

<p>-fbranch-probabilities After running a program compiled
with -fprofile-arcs, you can compile it a second time using
-fbranch-probabilities, to improve optimizations based on
the number of times each branch was taken. When the program
compiled with -fprofile-arcs exits it saves arc execution
counts to a file called sourcename.gcda for each source
file. The information in this data file is very dependent on
the structure of the generated code, so you must use the
same source code and the same optimization options for both
compilations.</p>

<p>With -fbranch-probabilities, GCC puts a REG_BR_PROB note
on each JUMP_INSN and CALL_INSN. These can be used to
improve optimization. Currently, they are only used in one
place: in reorg.c, instead of guessing which path a branch
is mostly to take, the REG_BR_PROB values are used to
exactly determine which path is taken more often.</p>

<p>-fprofile-values If combined with -fprofile-arcs, it
adds code so that some data about values of expressions in
the program is gathered.</p>

<p>With -fbranch-probabilities, it reads back the data
gathered from profiling values of expressions and adds
REG_VALUE_PROFILE notes to instructions for their later
usage in optimizations.</p>

<p>Enabled with -fprofile-generate and -fprofile-use.</p>

<p>-fvpt If combined with -fprofile-arcs, it instructs the
compiler to add a code to gather information about values of
expressions.</p>

<p>With -fbranch-probabilities, it reads back the data
gathered and actually performs the optimizations based on
them. Currently the optimizations include specialization of
division operation using the knowledge about the value of
the denominator.</p>

<p>-frename-registers Attempt to avoid false dependencies
in scheduled code by making use of registers left over after
register allocation. This optimization will most benefit
processors with lots of registers. Depending on the debug
information format adopted by the target, however, it can
make debugging impossible, since variables will no longer
stay in a &quot;home register&quot;.</p>

<p>Enabled by default with -funroll-loops.</p>

<p>-ftracer Perform tail duplication to enlarge superblock
size. This transformation simplifies the control flow of the
function allowing other optimizations to do better job.</p>

<p>Enabled with -fprofile-use.</p>

<p>-funroll-loops Unroll loops whose number of iterations
can be determined at compile time or upon entry to the loop.
-funroll-loops implies -frerun-cse-after-loop, -fweb and
-frename-registers. It also turns on complete loop peeling
(i.e. complete removal of loops with small constant number
of iterations). This option makes code larger, and may or
may not make it run faster.</p>

<p>Enabled with -fprofile-use.</p>

<p>-funroll-all-loops Unroll all loops, even if their
number of iterations is uncertain when the loop is entered.
This usually makes programs run more slowly.
-funroll-all-loops implies the same options as
-funroll-loops.</p>

<p>-fpeel-loops Peels the loops for that there is enough
information that they do not roll much (from profile
feedback). It also turns on complete loop peeling (i.e.
complete removal of loops with small constant number of
iterations).</p>

<p>Enabled with -fprofile-use.</p>

<p>-fmove-loop-invariants Enables the loop invariant motion
pass in the RTL loop optimizer. Enabled at level -O1</p>

<p>-funswitch-loops Move branches with loop invariant
conditions out of the loop, with duplicates of the loop on
both branches (modified according to result of the
condition).</p>

<p>-ffunction-sections -fdata-sections Place each function
or data item into its own section in the output file if the
target supports arbitrary sections. The name of the function
or the name of the data item determines the sections name in
the output file.</p>

<p>Use these options on systems where the linker can
perform optimizations to improve locality of reference in
the instruction space. Most systems using the ELF object
format and SPARC processors running Solaris 2 have linkers
with such optimizations. AIX may have these optimizations in
the future.</p>

<p>Only use these options when there are significant
benefits from doing so. When you specify these options, the
assembler and linker will create larger object and
executable files and will also be slower. You will not be
able to use &quot;gprof&quot; on all systems if you specify
this option and you may have problems with debugging if you
specify both this option and -g.</p>

<p>-fbranch-target-load-optimize Perform branch target
register load optimization before prologue / epilogue
threading. The use of target registers can typically be
exposed only during reload, thus hoisting loads out of loops
and doing inter-block scheduling needs a separate
optimization pass.</p>

<p>-fbranch-target-load-optimize2 Perform branch target
register load optimization after prologue / epilogue
threading.</p>

<p>-fbtr-bb-exclusive When performing branch target
register load optimization, dont reuse branch target
registers in within any basic block.</p>

<p>-fstack-protector Emit extra code to check for buffer
overflows, such as stack smashing attacks. This is done by
adding a guard variable to functions with vulnerable
objects. This includes functions that call alloca, and
functions with buffers larger than 8 bytes. The guards are
initialized when a function is entered and then checked when
the function exits. If a guard check fails, an error message
is printed and the program exits.</p>

<p>-fstack-protector-all Like -fstack-protector except that
all functions are protected.</p>

<p>-fsection-anchors Try to reduce the number of symbolic
address calculations by using shared &quot;anchor&quot;
symbols to address nearby objects. This transformation can
help to reduce the number of GOT entries and GOT accesses on
some targets.</p>

<p>For example, the implementation of the following
function &quot;foo&quot;:</p>

<p>static int a, b, c; int foo (void) { return a + b + c;
}</p>

<p>would usually calculate the addresses of all three
variables, but if you compile it with -fsection-anchors, it
will access the variables from a common anchor point
instead. The effect is similar to the following pseudocode
(which isnt valid C):</p>

<p>int foo (void) { register int *xr = &amp;x; return
xr[&amp;a - &amp;x] + xr[&amp;b - &amp;x] + xr[&amp;c -
&amp;x]; }</p>

<p>Not all targets support this option.</p>

<p>--param name=value In some places, GCC uses various
constants to control the amount of optimization that is
done. For example, GCC will not inline functions that
contain more that a certain number of instructions. You can
control some of these constants on the command-line using
the --param option.</p>

<p>The names of specific parameters, and the meaning of the
values, are tied to the internals of the compiler, and are
subject to change without notice in future releases.</p>

<p>In each case, the value is an integer. The allowable
choices for name are given in the following table:</p>

<p>sra-max-structure-size The maximum structure size, in
bytes, at which the scalar replacement of aggregates (SRA)
optimization will perform block copies. The default value,
0, implies that GCC will select the most appropriate size
itself.</p>

<p>sra-field-structure-ratio The threshold ratio (as a
percentage) between instantiated fields and the complete
structure size. We say that if the ratio of the number of
bytes in instantiated fields to the number of bytes in the
complete structure exceeds this parameter, then block copies
are not used. The default is 75.</p>

<p>struct-reorg-cold-struct-ratio The threshold ratio (as a
percentage) between a structure frequency and the frequency
of the hottest structure in the program. This parameter is
used by struct-reorg optimization enabled by
-fipa-struct-reorg. We say that if the ratio of a structure
frequency, calculated by profiling, to the hottest structure
frequency in the program is less than this parameter, then
structure reorganization is not applied to this structure.
The default is 10.</p>

<p>predictable-branch-cost-outcome When branch is predicted
to be taken with probability lower than this threshold (in
percent), then it is considered well predictable. The
default is 10.</p>

<p>max-crossjump-edges The maximum number of incoming edges
to consider for crossjumping. The algorithm used by
-fcrossjumping is O(N^2) in the number of edges incoming to
each block. Increasing values mean more aggressive
optimization, making the compile time increase with probably
small improvement in executable size.</p>

<p>min-crossjump-insns The minimum number of instructions
which must be matched at the end of two blocks before
crossjumping will be performed on them. This value is
ignored in the case where all instructions in the block
being crossjumped from are matched. The default value is
5.</p>

<p>max-grow-copy-bb-insns The maximum code size expansion
factor when copying basic blocks instead of jumping. The
expansion is relative to a jump instruction. The default
value is 8.</p>

<p>max-goto-duplication-insns The maximum number of
instructions to duplicate to a block that jumps to a
computed goto. To avoid O(N^2) behavior in a number of
passes, GCC factors computed gotos early in the compilation
process, and unfactors them as late as possible. Only
computed jumps at the end of a basic blocks with no more
than max-goto- duplication-insns are unfactored. The default
value is 8.</p>

<p>max-delay-slot-insn-search The maximum number of
instructions to consider when looking for an instruction to
fill a delay slot. If more than this arbitrary number of
instructions is searched, the time savings from filling the
delay slot will be minimal so stop searching. Increasing
values mean more aggressive optimization, making the compile
time increase with probably small improvement in executable
run time.</p>

<p>max-delay-slot-live-search When trying to fill delay
slots, the maximum number of instructions to consider when
searching for a block with valid live register information.
Increasing this arbitrarily chosen value means more
aggressive optimization, increasing the compile time. This
parameter should be removed when the delay slot code is
rewritten to maintain the control-flow graph.</p>

<p>max-gcse-memory The approximate maximum amount of memory
that will be allocated in order to perform the global common
subexpression elimination optimization. If more memory than
specified is required, the optimization will not be
done.</p>

<p>max-gcse-passes The maximum number of passes of GCSE to
run. The default is 1.</p>

<p>max-pending-list-length The maximum number of pending
dependencies scheduling will allow before flushing the
current state and starting over. Large functions with few
branches or calls can create excessively large lists which
needlessly consume memory and resources.</p>

<p>max-inline-insns-single Several parameters control the
tree inliner used in gcc. This number sets the maximum
number of instructions (counted in GCCs internal
representation) in a single function that the tree inliner
will consider for inlining. This only affects functions
declared inline and methods implemented in a class
declaration (C++). The default value is 450.</p>

<p>max-inline-insns-auto When you use -finline-functions
(included in -O3), a lot of functions that would otherwise
not be considered for inlining by the compiler will be
investigated. To those functions, a different (more
restrictive) limit compared to functions declared inline can
be applied. The default value is 90.</p>

<p>large-function-insns The limit specifying really large
functions. For functions larger than this limit after
inlining, inlining is constrained by --param
large-function-growth. This parameter is useful primarily to
avoid extreme compilation time caused by non- linear
algorithms used by the backend. The default value is
2700.</p>

<p>large-function-growth Specifies maximal growth of large
function caused by inlining in percents. The default value
is 100 which limits large function growth to 2.0 times the
original size.</p>

<p>large-unit-insns The limit specifying large translation
unit. Growth caused by inlining of units larger than this
limit is limited by --param inline-unit-growth. For small
units this might be too tight (consider unit consisting of
function A that is inline and B that just calls A three
time. If B is small relative to A, the growth of unit is 300
and yet such inlining is very sane. For very large units
consisting of small inlineable functions however the overall
unit growth limit is needed to avoid exponential explosion
of code size. Thus for smaller units, the size is increased
to --param large-unit-insns before applying --param
inline-unit-growth. The default is 10000</p>

<p>inline-unit-growth Specifies maximal overall growth of
the compilation unit caused by inlining. The default value
is 30 which limits unit growth to 1.3 times the original
size.</p>

<p>ipcp-unit-growth Specifies maximal overall growth of the
compilation unit caused by interprocedural constant
propagation. The default value is 10 which limits unit
growth to 1.1 times the original size.</p>

<p>large-stack-frame The limit specifying large stack
frames. While inlining the algorithm is trying to not grow
past this limit too much. Default value is 256 bytes.</p>

<p>large-stack-frame-growth Specifies maximal growth of
large stack frames caused by inlining in percents. The
default value is 1000 which limits large stack frame growth
to 11 times the original size.</p>

<p>max-inline-insns-recursive
max-inline-insns-recursive-auto Specifies maximum number of
instructions out-of-line copy of self recursive inline
function can grow into by performing recursive inlining.</p>

<p>For functions declared inline --param max-inline-insns-
recursive is taken into account. For function not declared
inline, recursive inlining happens only when
-finline-functions (included in -O3) is enabled and --param
max-inline-insns- recursive-auto is used. The default value
is 450.</p>

<p>max-inline-recursive-depth
max-inline-recursive-depth-auto Specifies maximum recursion
depth used by the recursive inlining.</p>

<p>For functions declared inline --param
max-inline-recursive- depth is taken into account. For
function not declared inline, recursive inlining happens
only when -finline-functions (included in -O3) is enabled
and --param max-inline-recursive- depth-auto is used. The
default value is 8.</p>

<p>min-inline-recursive-probability Recursive inlining is
profitable only for function having deep recursion in
average and can hurt for function having little recursion
depth by increasing the prologue size or complexity of
function body to other optimizers.</p>

<p>When profile feedback is available (see
-fprofile-generate) the actual recursion depth can be
guessed from probability that function will recurse via
given call expression. This parameter limits inlining only
to call expression whose probability exceeds given threshold
(in percents). The default value is 10.</p>

<p>inline-call-cost Specify cost of call instruction
relative to simple arithmetics operations (having cost of
1). Increasing this cost disqualifies inlining of non-leaf
functions and at the same time increases size of leaf
function that is believed to reduce function size by being
inlined. In effect it increases amount of inlining for code
having large abstraction penalty (many functions that just
pass the arguments to other functions) and decrease inlining
for code with low abstraction penalty. The default value is
12.</p>

<p>min-vect-loop-bound The minimum number of iterations
under which a loop will not get vectorized when
-ftree-vectorize is used. The number of iterations after
vectorization needs to be greater than the value specified
by this option to allow vectorization. The default value is
0.</p>

<p>max-unrolled-insns The maximum number of instructions
that a loop should have if that loop is unrolled, and if the
loop is unrolled, it determines how many times the loop code
is unrolled.</p>

<p>max-average-unrolled-insns The maximum number of
instructions biased by probabilities of their execution that
a loop should have if that loop is unrolled, and if the loop
is unrolled, it determines how many times the loop code is
unrolled.</p>

<p>max-unroll-times The maximum number of unrollings of a
single loop.</p>

<p>max-peeled-insns The maximum number of instructions that
a loop should have if that loop is peeled, and if the loop
is peeled, it determines how many times the loop code is
peeled.</p>

<p>max-peel-times The maximum number of peelings of a
single loop.</p>

<p>max-completely-peeled-insns The maximum number of insns
of a completely peeled loop.</p>

<p>max-completely-peel-times The maximum number of
iterations of a loop to be suitable for complete
peeling.</p>

<p>max-completely-peel-loop-nest-depth The maximum depth of
a loop nest suitable for complete peeling.</p>

<p>max-unswitch-insns The maximum number of insns of an
unswitched loop.</p>

<p>max-unswitch-level The maximum number of branches
unswitched in a single loop.</p>

<p>lim-expensive The minimum cost of an expensive
expression in the loop invariant motion.</p>

<p>iv-consider-all-candidates-bound Bound on number of
candidates for induction variables below that all candidates
are considered for each use in induction variable
optimizations. Only the most relevant candidates are
considered if there are more candidates, to avoid quadratic
time complexity.</p>

<p>iv-max-considered-uses The induction variable
optimizations give up on loops that contain more induction
variable uses.</p>

<p>iv-always-prune-cand-set-bound If number of candidates
in the set is smaller than this value, we always try to
remove unnecessary ivs from the set during its optimization
when a new iv is added to the set.</p>

<p>scev-max-expr-size Bound on size of expressions used in
the scalar evolutions analyzer. Large expressions slow the
analyzer.</p>

<p>omega-max-vars The maximum number of variables in an
Omega constraint system. The default value is 128.</p>

<p>omega-max-geqs The maximum number of inequalities in an
Omega constraint system. The default value is 256.</p>

<p>omega-max-eqs The maximum number of equalities in an
Omega constraint system. The default value is 128.</p>

<p>omega-max-wild-cards The maximum number of wildcard
variables that the Omega solver will be able to insert. The
default value is 18.</p>

<p>omega-hash-table-size The size of the hash table in the
Omega solver. The default value is 550.</p>

<p>omega-max-keys The maximal number of keys used by the
Omega solver. The default value is 500.</p>

<p>omega-eliminate-redundant-constraints When set to 1, use
expensive methods to eliminate all redundant constraints.
The default value is 0.</p>

<p>vect-max-version-for-alignment-checks The maximum number
of runtime checks that can be performed when doing loop
versioning for alignment in the vectorizer. See option
ftree-vect-loop-version for more information.</p>

<p>vect-max-version-for-alias-checks The maximum number of
runtime checks that can be performed when doing loop
versioning for alias in the vectorizer. See option
ftree-vect-loop-version for more information.</p>

<p>max-iterations-to-track The maximum number of iterations
of a loop the brute force algorithm for analysis of # of
iterations of the loop tries to evaluate.</p>

<p>hot-bb-count-fraction Select fraction of the maximal
count of repetitions of basic block in program given basic
block needs to have to be considered hot.</p>

<p>hot-bb-frequency-fraction Select fraction of the maximal
frequency of executions of basic block in function given
basic block needs to have to be considered hot</p>

<p>max-predicted-iterations The maximum number of loop
iterations we predict statically. This is useful in cases
where function contain single loop with known bound and
other loop with unknown. We predict the known number of
iterations correctly, while the unknown number of iterations
average to roughly 10. This means that the loop without
bounds would appear artificially cold relative to the other
one.</p>

<p>align-threshold Select fraction of the maximal frequency
of executions of basic block in function given basic block
will get aligned.</p>

<p>align-loop-iterations A loop expected to iterate at lest
the selected number of iterations will get aligned.</p>

<p>tracer-dynamic-coverage tracer-dynamic-coverage-feedback
This value is used to limit superblock formation once the
given percentage of executed instructions is covered. This
limits unnecessary code size expansion.</p>

<p>The tracer-dynamic-coverage-feedback is used only when
profile feedback is available. The real profiles (as opposed
to statically estimated ones) are much less balanced
allowing the threshold to be larger value.</p>

<p>tracer-max-code-growth Stop tail duplication once code
growth has reached given percentage. This is rather hokey
argument, as most of the duplicates will be eliminated later
in cross jumping, so it may be set to much higher values
than is the desired code growth.</p>

<p>tracer-min-branch-ratio Stop reverse growth when the
reverse probability of best edge is less than this threshold
(in percent).</p>

<p>tracer-min-branch-ratio tracer-min-branch-ratio-feedback
Stop forward growth if the best edge do have probability
lower than this threshold.</p>

<p>Similarly to tracer-dynamic-coverage two values are
present, one for compilation for profile feedback and one
for compilation without. The value for compilation with
profile feedback needs to be more conservative (higher) in
order to make tracer effective.</p>

<p>max-cse-path-length Maximum number of basic blocks on
path that cse considers. The default is 10.</p>

<p>max-cse-insns The maximum instructions CSE process
before flushing. The default is 1000.</p>

<p>max-aliased-vops Maximum number of virtual operands per
function allowed to represent aliases before triggering the
alias partitioning heuristic. Alias partitioning reduces
compile times and memory consumption needed for aliasing at
the expense of precision loss in alias information. The
default value for this parameter is 100 for -O1, 500 for -O2
and 1000 for -O3.</p>

<p>Notice that if a function contains more memory
statements than the value of this parameter, it is not
really possible to achieve this reduction. In this case, the
compiler will use the number of memory statements as the
value for max-aliased- vops.</p>

<p>avg-aliased-vops Average number of virtual operands per
statement allowed to represent aliases before triggering the
alias partitioning heuristic. This works in conjunction with
max-aliased-vops. If a function contains more than
max-aliased-vops virtual operators, then memory symbols will
be grouped into memory partitions until either the total
number of virtual operators is below max-aliased-vops or the
average number of virtual operators per memory statement is
below avg-aliased-vops. The default value for this parameter
is 1 for -O1 and -O2, and 3 for -O3.</p>

<p>ggc-min-expand GCC uses a garbage collector to manage
its own memory allocation. This parameter specifies the
minimum percentage by which the garbage collector s heap
should be allowed to expand between collections. Tuning this
may improve compilation speed; it has no effect on code
generation.</p>

<p>The default is 30% + 70% * (RAM/1GB) with an upper bound
of 100% when RAM &gt;= 1GB. If &quot;getrlimit&quot; is
available, the notion of &quot;RAM&quot; is the smallest of
actual RAM and &quot;RLIMIT_DATA&quot; or
&quot;RLIMIT_AS&quot;. If GCC is not able to calculate RAM
on a particular platform, the lower bound of 30% is used.
Setting this parameter and ggc-min-heapsize to zero causes a
full collection to occur at every opportunity. This is
extremely slow, but can be useful for debugging.</p>

<p>ggc-min-heapsize Minimum size of the garbage collectors
heap before it begins bothering to collect garbage. The
first collection occurs after the heap expands by
ggc-min-expand% beyond ggc-min- heapsize. Again, tuning this
may improve compilation speed, and has no effect on code
generation.</p>

<p>The default is the smaller of RAM/8, RLIMIT_RSS, or a
limit which tries to ensure that RLIMIT_DATA or RLIMIT_AS
are not exceeded, but with a lower bound of 4096 (four
megabytes) and an upper bound of 131072 (128 megabytes). If
GCC is not able to calculate RAM on a particular platform,
the lower bound is used. Setting this parameter very large
effectively disables garbage collection. Setting this
parameter and ggc-min-expand to zero causes a full
collection to occur at every opportunity.</p>

<p>max-reload-search-insns The maximum number of
instruction reload should look backward for equivalent
register. Increasing values mean more aggressive
optimization, making the compile time increase with probably
slightly better performance. The default value is 100.</p>

<p>max-cselib-memory-locations The maximum number of memory
locations cselib should take into account. Increasing values
mean more aggressive optimization, making the compile time
increase with probably slightly better performance. The
default value is 500.</p>

<p>reorder-blocks-duplicate
reorder-blocks-duplicate-feedback Used by basic block
reordering pass to decide whether to use unconditional
branch or duplicate the code on its destination. Code is
duplicated when its estimated size is smaller than this
value multiplied by the estimated size of unconditional jump
in the hot spots of the program.</p>

<p>The reorder-block-duplicate-feedback is used only when
profile feedback is available and may be set to higher
values than reorder-block-duplicate since information about
the hot spots is more accurate.</p>

<p>max-sched-ready-insns The maximum number of instructions
ready to be issued the scheduler should consider at any
given time during the first scheduling pass. Increasing
values mean more thorough searches, making the compilation
time increase with probably little benefit. The default
value is 100.</p>

<p>max-sched-region-blocks The maximum number of blocks in
a region to be considered for interblock scheduling. The
default value is 10.</p>

<p>max-pipeline-region-blocks The maximum number of blocks
in a region to be considered for pipelining in the selective
scheduler. The default value is 15.</p>

<p>max-sched-region-insns The maximum number of insns in a
region to be considered for interblock scheduling. The
default value is 100.</p>

<p>max-pipeline-region-insns The maximum number of insns in
a region to be considered for pipelining in the selective
scheduler. The default value is 200.</p>

<p>min-spec-prob The minimum probability (in percents) of
reaching a source block for interblock speculative
scheduling. The default value is 40.</p>

<p>max-sched-extend-regions-iters The maximum number of
iterations through CFG to extend regions. 0 - disable region
extension, N - do at most N iterations. The default value is
0.</p>

<p>max-sched-insn-conflict-delay The maximum conflict delay
for an insn to be considered for speculative motion. The
default value is 3.</p>

<p>sched-spec-prob-cutoff The minimal probability of
speculation success (in percents), so that speculative insn
will be scheduled. The default value is 40.</p>

<p>sched-mem-true-dep-cost Minimal distance (in CPU cycles)
between store and load targeting same memory locations. The
default value is 1.</p>

<p>selsched-max-lookahead The maximum size of the lookahead
window of selective scheduling. It is a depth of search for
available instructions. The default value is 50.</p>

<p>selsched-max-sched-times The maximum number of times
that an instruction will be scheduled during selective
scheduling. This is the limit on the number of iterations
through which the instruction may be pipelined. The default
value is 2.</p>

<p>selsched-max-insns-to-rename The maximum number of best
instructions in the ready list that are considered for
renaming in the selective scheduler. The default value is
2.</p>

<p>max-last-value-rtl The maximum size measured as number
of RTLs that can be recorded in an expression in combiner
for a pseudo register as last known value of that register.
The default is 10000.</p>

<p>integer-share-limit Small integer constants can use a
shared data structure, reducing the compilers memory usage
and increasing its speed. This sets the maximum value of a
shared integer constant. The default value is 256.</p>

<p>min-virtual-mappings Specifies the minimum number of
virtual mappings in the incremental SSA updater that should
be registered to trigger the virtual mappings heuristic
defined by virtual-mappings- ratio. The default value is
100.</p>

<p>virtual-mappings-ratio If the number of virtual mappings
is virtual-mappings-ratio bigger than the number of virtual
symbols to be updated, then the incremental SSA updater
switches to a full update for those symbols. The default
ratio is 3.</p>

<p>ssp-buffer-size The minimum size of buffers (i.e.
arrays) that will receive stack smashing protection when
-fstack-protection is used.</p>

<p>max-jump-thread-duplication-stmts Maximum number of
statements allowed in a block that needs to be duplicated
when threading jumps.</p>

<p>max-fields-for-field-sensitive Maximum number of fields
in a structure we will treat in a field sensitive manner
during pointer analysis. The default is zero for -O0, and
-O1 and 100 for -Os, -O2, and -O3.</p>

<p>prefetch-latency Estimate on average number of
instructions that are executed before prefetch finishes. The
distance we prefetch ahead is proportional to this constant.
Increasing this number may also lead to less streams being
prefetched (see simultaneous- prefetches).</p>

<p>simultaneous-prefetches Maximum number of prefetches
that can run at the same time.</p>

<p>l1-cache-line-size The size of cache line in L1 cache,
in bytes.</p>

<p>l1-cache-size The size of L1 cache, in kilobytes.</p>

<p>l2-cache-size The size of L2 cache, in kilobytes.</p>

<p>use-canonical-types Whether the compiler should use the
&quot;canonical&quot; type system. By default, this should
always be 1, which uses a more efficient internal mechanism
for comparing types in C++ and Objective-C++. However, if
bugs in the canonical type system are causing compilation
failures, set this value to 0 to disable canonical
types.</p>

<p>switch-conversion-max-branch-ratio Switch initialization
conversion will refuse to create arrays that are bigger than
switch-conversion-max-branch-ratio times the number of
branches in the switch.</p>

<p>max-partial-antic-length Maximum length of the partial
antic set computed during the tree partial redundancy
elimination optimization (-ftree-pre) when optimizing at -O3
and above. For some sorts of source code the enhanced
partial redundancy elimination optimization can run away,
consuming all of the memory available on the host machine.
This parameter sets a limit on the length of the sets that
are computed, which prevents the runaway behavior. Setting a
value of 0 for this parameter will allow an unlimited set
length.</p>

<p>sccvn-max-scc-size Maximum size of a strongly connected
component (SCC) during SCCVN processing. If this limit is
hit, SCCVN processing for the whole function will not be
done and optimizations depending on it will be disabled. The
default maximum SCC size is 10000.</p>

<p>ira-max-loops-num IRA uses a regional register
allocation by default. If a function contains loops more
than number given by the parameter, only at most given
number of the most frequently executed loops will form
regions for the regional register allocation. The default
value of the parameter is 100.</p>

<p>ira-max-conflict-table-size Although IRA uses a
sophisticated algorithm of compression conflict table, the
table can be still big for huge functions. If the conflict
table for a function could be more than size in MB given by
the parameter, the conflict table is not built and faster,
simpler, and lower quality register allocation algorithm
will be used. The algorithm do not use pseudo- register
conflicts. The default value of the parameter is 2000.</p>

<p>loop-invariant-max-bbs-in-loop Loop invariant motion can
be very expensive, both in compile time and in amount of
needed compile time memory, with very large loops. Loops
with more basic blocks than this parameter won t have loop
invariant motion optimization performed on them. The default
value of the parameter is 1000 for -O1 and 10000 for -O2 and
above.</p>

<p>max-vartrack-size Sets a maximum number of hash table
slots to use during variable tracking dataflow analysis of
any function. If this limit is exceeded with variable
tracking at assignments enabled, analysis for that function
is retried without it, after removing all debug insns from
the function. If the limit is exceeded even without debug
insns, var tracking analysis is completely disabled for the
function. Setting the parameter to zero makes it
unlimited.</p>

<p>min-nondebug-insn-uid Use uids starting at this
parameter for nondebug insns. The range below the parameter
is reserved exclusively for debug insns created by
-fvar-tracking-assignments, but debug insns may get
(non-overlapping) uids above it if the reserved range is
exhausted.</p>

<p>Options Controlling the Preprocessor These options
control the C preprocessor, which is run on each C source
file before actual compilation.</p>

<p>If you use the -E option, nothing is done except
preprocessing. Some of these options make sense only
together with -E because they cause the preprocessor output
to be unsuitable for actual compilation.</p>

<p>-Wp,option You can use -Wp,option to bypass the compiler
driver and pass option directly through to the preprocessor.
If option contains commas, it is split into multiple options
at the commas. However, many options are modified,
translated or interpreted by the compiler driver before
being passed to the preprocessor, and -Wp forcibly bypasses
this phase. The preprocessor s direct interface is
undocumented and subject to change, so whenever possible you
should avoid using -Wp and let the driver handle the options
instead.</p>

<p>-Xpreprocessor option Pass option as an option to the
preprocessor. You can use this to supply system-specific
preprocessor options which GCC does not know how to
recognize.</p>

<p>If you want to pass an option that takes an argument,
you must use -Xpreprocessor twice, once for the option and
once for the argument.</p>

<p>-D name Predefine name as a macro, with definition
1.</p>

<p>-D name=definition The contents of definition are
tokenized and processed as if they appeared during
translation phase three in a #define directive. In
particular, the definition will be truncated by embedded
newline characters.</p>

<p>If you are invoking the preprocessor from a shell or
shell-like program you may need to use the shells quoting
syntax to protect characters such as spaces that have a
meaning in the shell syntax.</p>

<p>If you wish to define a function-like macro on the
command line, write its argument list with surrounding
parentheses before the equals sign (if any). Parentheses are
meaningful to most shells, so you will need to quote the
option. With sh and csh, -name(args...)=definitionworks.</p>

<p>-D and -U options are processed in the order they are
given on the command line. All -imacros file and -include
file options are processed after all -D and -U options.</p>

<p>-U name Cancel any previous definition of name, either
built in or provided with a -D option.</p>

<p>-undef Do not predefine any system-specific or
GCC-specific macros. The standard predefined macros remain
defined.</p>

<p>-I dir Add the directory dir to the list of directories
to be searched for header files. Directories named by -I are
searched before the standard system include directories. If
the directory dir is a standard system include directory,
the option is ignored to ensure that the default search
order for system directories and the special treatment of
system headers are not defeated . If dir begins with
&quot;=&quot;, then the &quot;=&quot; will be replaced by
the sysroot prefix; see --sysroot and -isysroot.</p>

<p>-o file Write output to file. This is the same as
specifying file as the second non-option argument to cpp.
gcc has a different interpretation of a second non-option
argument, so you must use -o to specify the output file.</p>

<p>-Wall Turns on all optional warnings which are desirable
for normal code. At present this is -Wcomment, -Wtrigraphs,
-Wmultichar and a warning about integer promotion causing a
change of sign in &quot;#if&quot; expressions. Note that
many of the preprocessor s warnings are on by default and
have no options to control them.</p>

<p>-Wcomment -Wcomments Warn whenever a comment-start
sequence /* appears in a /* comment, or whenever a
backslash-newline appears in a // comment. (Both forms have
the same effect.)</p>

<p>-Wtrigraphs Most trigraphs in comments cannot affect the
meaning of the program. However, a trigraph that would form
an escaped newline (??/ at the end of a line) can, by
changing where the comment begins or ends. Therefore, only
trigraphs that would form escaped newlines produce warnings
inside a comment.</p>

<p>This option is implied by -Wall. If -Wall is not given,
this option is still enabled unless trigraphs are enabled.
To get trigraph conversion without warnings, but get the
other -Wall warnings, use -trigraphs -Wall
-Wno-trigraphs.</p>

<p>-Wtraditional Warn about certain constructs that behave
differently in traditional and ISO C. Also warn about ISO C
constructs that have no traditional C equivalent, and
problematic constructs which should be avoided.</p>

<p>-Wundef Warn whenever an identifier which is not a macro
is encountered in an #if directive, outside of defined. Such
identifiers are replaced with zero.</p>

<p>-Wunused-macros Warn about macros defined in the main
file that are unused. A macro is used if it is expanded or
tested for existence at least once. The preprocessor will
also warn if the macro has not been used at the time it is
redefined or undefined.</p>

<p>Built-in macros, macros defined on the command line, and
macros defined in include files are not warned about.</p>

<p>Note: If a macro is actually used, but only used in
skipped conditional blocks, then CPP will report it as
unused. To avoid the warning in such a case, you might
improve the scope of the macros definition by, for example,
moving it into the first skipped block. Alternatively, you
could provide a dummy use with something like:</p>

<p>#if defined the_macro_causing_the_warning #endif</p>

<p>-Wendif-labels Warn whenever an #else or an #endif are
followed by text. This usually happens in code of the
form</p>

<p>#if FOO ... #else FOO ... #endif FOO</p>

<p>The second and third &quot;FOO&quot; should be in
comments, but often are not in older programs. This warning
is on by default.</p>

<p>-Werror Make all warnings into hard errors. Source code
which triggers warnings will be rejected.</p>

<p>-Wsystem-headers Issue warnings for code in system
headers. These are normally unhelpful in finding bugs in
your own code, therefore suppressed. If you are responsible
for the system library, you may want to see them.</p>

<p>-w Suppress all warnings, including those which GNU CPP
issues by default.</p>

<p>-pedantic Issue all the mandatory diagnostics listed in
the C standard. Some of them are left out by default, since
they trigger frequently on harmless code.</p>

<p>-pedantic-errors Issue all the mandatory diagnostics,
and make all mandatory diagnostics into errors. This
includes mandatory diagnostics that GCC issues without
-pedantic but treats as warnings.</p>

<p>-M Instead of outputting the result of preprocessing,
output a rule suitable for make describing the dependencies
of the main source file. The preprocessor outputs one make
rule containing the object file name for that source file, a
colon, and the names of all the included files, including
those coming from -include or -imacros command line
options.</p>

<p>Unless specified explicitly (with -MT or -MQ), the
object file name consists of the name of the source file
with any suffix replaced with object file suffix and with
any leading directory parts removed. If there are many
included files then the rule is split into several lines
using&minus;newline. The rule has no commands.</p>

<p>This option does not suppress the preprocessors debug
output, such as -dM. To avoid mixing such debug output with
the dependency rules you should explicitly specify the
dependency output file with -MF, or use an environment
variable like DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT. Debug output will still
be sent to the regular output stream as normal.</p>

<p>Passing -M to the driver implies -E, and suppresses
warnings with an implicit -w.</p>

<p>-MM Like -M but do not mention header files that are
found in system header directories, nor header files that
are included, directly or indirectly, from such a
header.</p>

<p>This implies that the choice of angle brackets or double
quotes in an #include directive does not in itself determine
whether that header will appear in -MM dependency output.
This is a slight change in semantics from GCC versions 3.0
and earlier.</p>

<p>-MF file When used with -M or -MM, specifies a file to
write the dependencies to. If no -MF switch is given the
preprocessor sends the rules to the same place it would have
sent preprocessed output.</p>

<p>When used with the driver options -MD or -MMD, -MF
overrides the default dependency output file.</p>

<p>-MG In conjunction with an option such as -M requesting
dependency generation, -MG assumes missing header files are
generated files and adds them to the dependency list without
raising an error. The dependency filename is taken directly
from the &quot;#include&quot; directive without prepending
any path. -MG also suppresses preprocessed output, as a
missing header file renders this useless.</p>

<p>This feature is used in automatic updating of
makefiles.</p>

<p>-MP This option instructs CPP to add a phony target for
each dependency other than the main file, causing each to
depend on nothing. These dummy rules work around errors make
gives if you remove header files without updating the
Makefile to match.</p>

<p>This is typical output:</p>

<p>test.o: test.c test.h</p>

<p>test.h:</p>

<p>-MT target Change the target of the rule emitted by
dependency generation. By default CPP takes the name of the
main input file, deletes any directory components and any
file suffix such as .c, and appends the platforms usual
object suffix. The result is the target.</p>

<p>An -MT option will set the target to be exactly the
string you specify. If you want multiple targets, you can
specify them as a single argument to -MT, or use multiple
-MT options.</p>

<p>For example, -MT$(objpfx)foo.omight give</p>

<p>$(objpfx)foo.o: foo.c</p>

<p>-MQ target Same as -MT, but it quotes any characters
which are special to Make. -MQ$(objpfx)foo.ogives</p>

<p>$$(objpfx)foo.o: foo.c</p>

<p>The default target is automatically quoted, as if it
were given with -MQ.</p>

<p>-MD -MD is equivalent to -M -MF file, except that -E is
not implied. The driver determines file based on whether an
-o option is given. If it is, the driver uses its argument
but with a suffix of .d, otherwise it takes the name of the
input file, removes any directory components and suffix, and
applies a .d suffix.</p>

<p>If -MD is used in conjunction with -E, any -o switch is
understood to specify the dependency output file, but if
used without -E, each -o is understood to specify a target
object file.</p>

<p>Since -E is not implied, -MD can be used to generate a
dependency output file as a side-effect of the compilation
process.</p>

<p>-MMD Like -MD except mention only user header files, not
system header files.</p>

<p>-fpch-deps When using precompiled headers, this flag
will cause the dependency-output flags to also list the
files from the precompiled header s dependencies. If not
specified only the precompiled header would be listed and
not the files that were used to create it because those
files are not consulted when a precompiled header is
used.</p>

<p>-fpch-preprocess This option allows use of a precompiled
header together with -E. It inserts a special
&quot;#pragma&quot;, &quot;#pragma GCC pch_preprocess
&quot;&lt;filename&gt;&quot;&quot; in the output to mark the
place where the precompiled header was found, and its
filename. When -fpreprocessed is in use, GCC recognizes this
&quot;#pragma&quot; and loads the PCH.</p>

<p>This option is off by default, because the resulting
preprocessed output is only really suitable as input to GCC.
It is switched on by -save-temps.</p>

<p>You should not write this &quot;#pragma&quot; in your
own code, but it is safe to edit the filename if the PCH
file is available in a different location. The filename may
be absolute or it may be relative to GCCs current
directory.</p>

<p>-x c -x c++ -x objective-c -x assembler-with-cpp Specify
the source language: C, C++, Objective-C, or assembly. This
has nothing to do with standards conformance or extensions;
it merely selects which base syntax to expect. If you give
none of these options, cpp will deduce the language from the
extension of the source file: .c, .cc, .m, or .S. Some other
common extensions for C++ and assembly are also recognized.
If cpp does not recognize the extension, it will treat the
file as C; this is the most generic mode.</p>

<p>Note: Previous versions of cpp accepted a -lang option
which selected both the language and the standards
conformance level. This option has been removed, because it
conflicts with the -l option.</p>

<p>-std=standard -ansi Specify the standard to which the
code should conform. Currently CPP knows about C and C++
standards; others may be added in the future.</p>

<p>standard may be one of:</p>

<p>&quot;iso9899:1990&quot; &quot;c89&quot; The ISO C
standard from 1990. c89 is the customary shorthand for this
version of the standard.</p>

<p>The -ansi option is equivalent to -std=c89.</p>

<p>&quot;iso9899:199409&quot; The 1990 C standard, as
amended in 1994.</p>

<p>&quot;iso9899:1999&quot; &quot;c99&quot;
&quot;iso9899:199x&quot; &quot;c9x&quot; The revised ISO C
standard, published in December 1999. Before publication,
this was known as C9X.</p>

<p>&quot;gnu89&quot; The 1990 C standard plus GNU
extensions. This is the default.</p>

<p>&quot;gnu99&quot; &quot;gnu9x&quot; The 1999 C standard
plus GNU extensions.</p>

<p>&quot;c++98&quot; The 1998 ISO C++ standard plus
amendments.</p>

<p>&quot;gnu++98&quot; The same as -std=c++98 plus GNU
extensions. This is the default for C++ code.</p>

<p>-I- Split the include path. Any directories specified
with -I options before -I- are searched only for headers
requested with &quot;#include &quot;file&quot;&quot;; they
are not searched for &quot;#include &lt;file&gt;&quot;. If
additional directories are specified with -I options after
the -I-, those directories are searched for all #include
directives.</p>

<p>In addition, -I- inhibits the use of the directory of
the current file directory as the first search directory for
&quot;#include &quot;file&quot;&quot;. This option has been
deprecated.</p>

<p>-nostdinc Do not search the standard system directories
for header files. Only the directories you have specified
with -I options (and the directory of the current file, if
appropriate) are searched.</p>

<p>-nostdinc++ Do not search for header files in the
C++-specific standard directories, but do still search the
other standard directories. (This option is used when
building the C++ library.)</p>

<p>-include file Process file as if &quot;#include
&quot;file&quot;&quot; appeared as the first line of the
primary source file. However, the first directory searched
for file is the preprocessors working directory instead of
the directory containing the main source file. If not found
there, it is searched for in the remainder of the
&quot;#include &quot;...&quot;&quot; search chain as
normal.</p>

<p>If multiple -include options are given, the files are
included in the order they appear on the command line.</p>

<p>-imacros file Exactly like -include, except that any
output produced by scanning file is thrown away. Macros it
defines remain defined. This allows you to acquire all the
macros from a header without also processing its
declarations.</p>

<p>All files specified by -imacros are processed before all
files specified by -include.</p>

<p>-idirafter dir Search dir for header files, but do it
after all directories specified with -I and the standard
system directories have been exhausted. dir is treated as a
system include directory. If dir begins with &quot;=&quot;,
then the &quot;=&quot; will be replaced by the sysroot
prefix; see --sysroot and -isysroot.</p>

<p>-iprefix prefix Specify prefix as the prefix for
subsequent -iwithprefix options. If the prefix represents a
directory, you should include the final /.</p>

<p>-iwithprefix dir -iwithprefixbefore dir Append dir to
the prefix specified previously with -iprefix, and add the
resulting directory to the include search path.
-iwithprefixbefore puts it in the same place -I would;
-iwithprefix puts it where -idirafter would.</p>

<p>-isysroot dir This option is like the --sysroot option,
but applies only to header files. See the --sysroot option
for more information.</p>

<p>-imultilib dir Use dir as a subdirectory of the
directory containing target- specific C++ headers.</p>

<p>-isystem dir Search dir for header files, after all
directories specified by -I but before the standard system
directories. Mark it as a system directory, so that it gets
the same special treatment as is applied to the standard
system directories. If dir begins with &quot;=&quot;, then
the &quot;=&quot; will be replaced by the sysroot prefix;
see --sysroot and -isysroot.</p>

<p>-iquote dir Search dir only for header files requested
with &quot;#include &quot;file&quot;&quot;; they are not
searched for &quot;#include &lt;file&gt;&quot;, before all
directories specified by -I and before the standard system
directories. If dir begins with &quot;=&quot;, then the
&quot;=&quot; will be replaced by the sysroot prefix; see
--sysroot and -isysroot.</p>

<p>-fdirectives-only When preprocessing, handle directives,
but do not expand macros.</p>

<p>The option s behavior depends on the -E and
-fpreprocessed options.</p>

<p>With -E, preprocessing is limited to the handling of
directives such as &quot;#define&quot;, &quot;#ifdef&quot;,
and &quot;#error&quot;. Other preprocessor operations, such
as macro expansion and trigraph conversion are not
performed. In addition, the -dD option is implicitly
enabled.</p>

<p>With -fpreprocessed, predefinition of command line and
most builtin macros is disabled. Macros such as
&quot;__LINE__&quot;, which are contextually dependent, are
handled normally. This enables compilation of files
previously preprocessed with &quot;-E
-fdirectives-only&quot;.</p>

<p>With both -E and -fpreprocessed, the rules for
-fpreprocessed take precedence. This enables full
preprocessing of files previously preprocessed with &quot;-E
-fdirectives-only&quot;.</p>

<p>-fdollars-in-identifiers Accept $ in identifiers.</p>

<p>-fextended-identifiers Accept universal character names
in identifiers. This option is experimental; in a future
version of GCC, it will be enabled by default for C99 and
C++.</p>

<p>-fpreprocessed Indicate to the preprocessor that the
input file has already been preprocessed. This suppresses
things like macro expansion, trigraph conversion, escaped
newline splicing, and processing of most directives. The
preprocessor still recognizes and removes comments, so that
you can pass a file preprocessed with -C to the compiler
without problems. In this mode the integrated preprocessor
is little more than a tokenizer for the front ends.</p>

<p>-fpreprocessed is implicit if the input file has one of
the extensions .i, .ii or .mi. These are the extensions that
GCC uses for preprocessed files created by -save-temps.</p>

<p>-ftabstop=width Set the distance between tab stops. This
helps the preprocessor report correct column numbers in
warnings or errors, even if tabs appear on the line. If the
value is less than 1 or greater than 100, the option is
ignored. The default is 8.</p>

<p>-fexec-charset=charset Set the execution character set,
used for string and character constants. The default is
UTF-8. charset can be any encoding supported by the systems
&quot;iconv&quot; library routine.</p>

<p>-fwide-exec-charset=charset Set the wide execution
character set, used for wide string and character constants.
The default is UTF-32 or UTF-16, whichever corresponds to
the width of &quot;wchar_t&quot;. As with -fexec-charset,
charset can be any encoding supported by the system s
&quot;iconv&quot; library routine; however, you will have
problems with encodings that do not fit exactly in
&quot;wchar_t&quot;.</p>

<p>-finput-charset=charset Set the input character set,
used for translation from the character set of the input
file to the source character set used by GCC. If the locale
does not specify, or GCC cannot get this information from
the locale, the default is UTF-8. This can be overridden by
either the locale or this command line option. Currently the
command line option takes precedence if theres a conflict.
charset can be any encoding supported by the systems
&quot;iconv&quot; library routine.</p>

<p>-fworking-directory Enable generation of linemarkers in
the preprocessor output that will let the compiler know the
current working directory at the time of preprocessing. When
this option is enabled, the preprocessor will emit, after
the initial linemarker, a second linemarker with the current
working directory followed by two slashes. GCC will use this
directory, when it s present in the preprocessed input, as
the directory emitted as the current working directory in
some debugging information formats. This option is
implicitly enabled if debugging information is enabled, but
this can be inhibited with the negated form
-fno-working-directory. If the -P flag is present in the
command line, this option has no effect, since no
&quot;#line&quot; directives are emitted whatsoever.</p>

<p>-fno-show-column Do not print column numbers in
diagnostics. This may be necessary if diagnostics are being
scanned by a program that does not understand the column
numbers, such as dejagnu.</p>

<p>-A predicate=answer Make an assertion with the predicate
predicate and answer answer. This form is preferred to the
older form -A predicate(answer), which is still supported,
because it does not use shell special characters.</p>

<p>-A -predicate=answer Cancel an assertion with the
predicate predicate and answer answer.</p>

<p>-dCHARS CHARS is a sequence of one or more of the
following characters, and must not be preceded by a space.
Other characters are interpreted by the compiler proper, or
reserved for future versions of GCC, and so are silently
ignored. If you specify characters whose behavior conflicts,
the result is undefined.</p>

<p>M Instead of the normal output, generate a list of
#define directives for all the macros defined during the
execution of the preprocessor, including predefined macros.
This gives you a way of finding out what is predefined in
your version of the preprocessor. Assuming you have no file
foo.h, the command</p>

<p>touch foo.h; cpp -dM foo.h</p>

<p>will show all the predefined macros.</p>

<p>If you use -dM without the -E option, -dM is interpreted
as a synonym for -fdump-rtl-mach.</p>

<p>D Like M except in two respects: it does not include the
predefined macros, and it outputs both the #define
directives and the result of preprocessing. Both kinds of
output go to the standard output file.</p>

<p>N Like D, but emit only the macro names, not their
expansions.</p>

<p>I Output #include directives in addition to the result
of preprocessing.</p>

<p>U Like D except that only macros that are expanded, or
whose definedness is tested in preprocessor directives, are
output; the output is delayed until the use or test of the
macro; and #undef directives are also output for macros
tested but undefined at the time.</p>

<p>-P Inhibit generation of linemarkers in the output from
the preprocessor. This might be useful when running the
preprocessor on something that is not C code, and will be
sent to a program which might be confused by the
linemarkers.</p>

<p>-C Do not discard comments. All comments are passed
through to the output file, except for comments in processed
directives, which are deleted along with the directive.</p>

<p>You should be prepared for side effects when using -C;
it causes the preprocessor to treat comments as tokens in
their own right. For example, comments appearing at the
start of what would be a directive line have the effect of
turning that line into an ordinary source line, since the
first token on the line is no longer a #.</p>

<p>-CC Do not discard comments, including during macro
expansion. This is like -C, except that comments contained
within macros are also passed through to the output file
where the macro is expanded.</p>

<p>In addition to the side-effects of the -C option, the
-CC option causes all C++-style comments inside a macro to
be converted to C-style comments. This is to prevent later
use of that macro from inadvertently commenting out the
remainder of the source line.</p>

<p>The -CC option is generally used to support lint
comments.</p>

<p>-traditional-cpp Try to imitate the behavior of
old-fashioned C preprocessors, as opposed to ISO C
preprocessors.</p>

<p>-trigraphs Process trigraph sequences. These are
three-character sequences, all starting with ??, that are
defined by ISO C to stand for single characters. For
example, ??/ stands for so??/nis a character constant for a
newline. By default, GCC ignores trigraphs, but in
standard-conforming modes it converts them. See the -std and
-ansi options.</p>

<p>The nine trigraphs and their replacements are</p>

<p>Trigraph: ??( ??) ??&lt; ??&gt; ??= ??/ ??&rsquo; ??!
??- Replacement: [ ] { } # ^ | ~</p>

<p>-remap Enable special code to work around file systems
which only permit very short file names, such as MS-DOS.</p>

<p>--help --target-help Print text describing all the
command line options instead of preprocessing anything.</p>

<p>-v Verbose mode. Print out GNU CPPs version number at
the beginning of execution, and report the final form of the
include path.</p>

<p>-H Print the name of each header file used, in addition
to other normal activities. Each name is indented to show
how deep in the #include stack it is. Precompiled header
files are also printed, even if they are found to be
invalid; an invalid precompiled header file is printed with
...x and a valid one with ...! .</p>

<p>-version --version Print out GNU CPPs version number.
With one dash, proceed to preprocess as normal. With two
dashes, exit immediately.</p>

<p>Passing Options to the Assembler You can pass options to
the assembler.</p>

<p>-Wa,option Pass option as an option to the assembler. If
option contains commas, it is split into multiple options at
the commas.</p>

<p>-Xassembler option Pass option as an option to the
assembler. You can use this to supply system-specific
assembler options which GCC does not know how to
recognize.</p>

<p>If you want to pass an option that takes an argument,
you must use -Xassembler twice, once for the option and once
for the argument.</p>

<p>Options for Linking These options come into play when
the compiler links object files into an executable output
file. They are meaningless if the compiler is not doing a
link step.</p>

<p>object-file-name A file name that does not end in a
special recognized suffix is considered to name an object
file or library. (Object files are distinguished from
libraries by the linker according to the file contents.) If
linking is done, these object files are used as input to the
linker.</p>

<p>-c -S -E If any of these options is used, then the
linker is not run, and object file names should not be used
as arguments.</p>

<p>-llibrary -l library Search the library named library
when linking. (The second alternative with the library as a
separate argument is only for POSIX compliance and is not
recommended.)</p>

<p>It makes a difference where in the command you write
this option; the linker searches and processes libraries and
object files in the order they are specified. Thus, foo.o
-lz bar.o searches library z after file foo.o but before
bar.o. If bar.o refers to functions in z, those functions
may not be loaded.</p>

<p>The linker searches a standard list of directories for
the library, which is actually a file named liblibrary.a.
The linker then uses this file as if it had been specified
precisely by name.</p>

<p>The directories searched include several standard system
directories plus any that you specify with -L.</p>

<p>Normally the files found this way are library
files---archive files whose members are object files. The
linker handles an archive file by scanning through it for
members which define symbols that have so far been
referenced but not defined. But if the file that is found is
an ordinary object file, it is linked in the usual fashion.
The only difference between using an -l option and
specifying a file name is that -l surrounds library with lib
and .a and searches several directories.</p>

<p>-lobjc You need this special case of the -l option in
order to link an Objective-C or Objective-C++ program.</p>

<p>-nostartfiles Do not use the standard system startup
files when linking. The standard system libraries are used
normally, unless -nostdlib or -nodefaultlibs is used.</p>

<p>-nodefaultlibs Do not use the standard system libraries
when linking. Only the libraries you specify will be passed
to the linker. The standard startup files are used normally,
unless -nostartfiles is used. The compiler may generate
calls to &quot;memcmp&quot;, &quot;memset&quot;,
&quot;memcpy&quot; and &quot;memmove&quot;. These entries
are usually resolved by entries in libc. These entry points
should be supplied through some other mechanism when this
option is specified.</p>

<p>-nostdlib Do not use the standard system startup files
or libraries when linking. No startup files and only the
libraries you specify will be passed to the linker. The
compiler may generate calls to &quot;memcmp&quot;,
&quot;memset&quot;, &quot;memcpy&quot; and
&quot;memmove&quot;. These entries are usually resolved by
entries in libc. These entry points should be supplied
through some other mechanism when this option is
specified.</p>

<p>One of the standard libraries bypassed by -nostdlib and
-nodefaultlibs is libgcc.a, a library of internal
subroutines that GCC uses to overcome shortcomings of
particular machines, or special needs for some
languages.</p>

<p>In most cases, you need libgcc.a even when you want to
avoid other standard libraries. In other words, when you
specify -nostdlib or -nodefaultlibs you should usually
specify -lgcc as well. This ensures that you have no
unresolved references to internal GCC library subroutines.
(For example, __main, used to ensure C++ constructors will
be called.)</p>

<p>-pie Produce a position independent executable on
targets which support it. For predictable results, you must
also specify the same set of options that were used to
generate code (-fpie, -fPIE, or model suboptions) when you
specify this option.</p>

<p>-rdynamic Pass the flag -export-dynamic to the ELF
linker, on targets that support it. This instructs the
linker to add all symbols, not only used ones, to the
dynamic symbol table. This option is needed for some uses of
&quot;dlopen&quot; or to allow obtaining backtraces from
within a program.</p>

<p>-s Remove all symbol table and relocation information
from the executable.</p>

<p>-static On systems that support dynamic linking, this
prevents linking with the shared libraries. On other
systems, this option has no effect.</p>

<p>-shared Produce a shared object which can then be linked
with other objects to form an executable. Not all systems
support this option. For predictable results, you must also
specify the same set of options that were used to generate
code (-fpic, -fPIC, or model suboptions) when you specify
this option.[1]</p>

<p>-shared-libgcc -static-libgcc On systems that provide
libgcc as a shared library, these options force the use of
either the shared or static version respectively. If no
shared version of libgcc was built when the compiler was
configured, these options have no effect.</p>

<p>There are several situations in which an application
should use the shared libgcc instead of the static version.
The most common of these is when the application wishes to
throw and catch exceptions across different shared
libraries. In that case, each of the libraries as well as
the application itself should use the shared libgcc.</p>

<p>Therefore, the G++ and GCJ drivers automatically add
-shared-libgcc whenever you build a shared library or a main
executable, because C++ and Java programs typically use
exceptions, so this is the right thing to do.</p>

<p>If, instead, you use the GCC driver to create shared
libraries, you may find that they will not always be linked
with the shared libgcc. If GCC finds, at its configuration
time, that you have a non-GNU linker or a GNU linker that
does not support option --eh-frame-hdr, it will link the
shared version of libgcc into shared libraries by default.
Otherwise, it will take advantage of the linker and optimize
away the linking with the shared version of libgcc, linking
with the static version of libgcc by default. This allows
exceptions to propagate through such shared libraries,
without incurring relocation costs at library load time.</p>

<p>However, if a library or main executable is supposed to
throw or catch exceptions, you must link it using the G++ or
GCJ driver, as appropriate for the languages used in the
program, or using the option -shared-libgcc, such that it is
linked with the shared libgcc.</p>

<p>-symbolic Bind references to global symbols when
building a shared object. Warn about any unresolved
references (unless overridden by the link editor option
-Xlinker -z -Xlinker defs). Only a few systems support this
option.</p>

<p>-T script Use script as the linker script. This option
is supported by most systems using the GNU linker. On some
targets, such as bare-board targets without an operating
system, the -T option may be required when linking to avoid
references to undefined symbols.</p>

<p>-Xlinker option Pass option as an option to the linker.
You can use this to supply system-specific linker options
which GCC does not know how to recognize.</p>

<p>If you want to pass an option that takes a separate
argument, you must use -Xlinker twice, once for the option
and once for the argument. For example, to pass -assert
definitions, you must write -Xlinker -assert -Xlinker
definitions. It does not work to write -Xlinker
&quot;-assert definitions&quot;, because this passes the
entire string as a single argument, which is not what the
linker expects.</p>

<p>When using the GNU linker, it is usually more convenient
to pass arguments to linker options using the option=value
syntax than as separate arguments. For example, you can
specify -Xlinker -Map=output.map rather than -Xlinker -Map
-Xlinker output.map. Other linkers may not support this
syntax for command-line options.</p>

<p>-Wl,option Pass option as an option to the linker. If
option contains commas, it is split into multiple options at
the commas. You can use this syntax to pass an argument to
the option. For example, -Wl,-Map,output.map passes -Map
output.map to the linker. When using the GNU linker, you can
also get the same effect with -Wl,-Map=output.map.</p>

<p>-u symbol Pretend the symbol symbol is undefined, to
force linking of library modules to define it. You can use
-u multiple times with different symbols to force loading of
additional library modules.</p>

<p>Options for Directory Search These options specify
directories to search for header files, for libraries and
for parts of the compiler:</p>

<p>-Idir Add the directory dir to the head of the list of
directories to be searched for header files. This can be
used to override a system header file, substituting your own
version, since these directories are searched before the
system header file directories. However, you should not use
this option to add directories that contain vendor-supplied
system header files (use -isystem for that). If you use more
than one -I option, the directories are scanned in
left-to-right order; the standard system directories come
after.</p>

<p>If a standard system include directory, or a directory
specified with -isystem, is also specified with -I, the -I
option will be ignored. The directory will still be searched
but as a system directory at its normal position in the
system include chain. This is to ensure that GCCs procedure
to fix buggy system headers and the ordering for the
include_next directive are not inadvertently changed. If you
really need to change the search order for system
directories, use the -nostdinc and/or -isystem options.</p>

<p>-iquotedir Add the directory dir to the head of the list
of directories to be searched for header files only for the
case of #include &quot;file&quot;; they are not searched for
#include &lt;file&gt;, otherwise just like -I.</p>

<p>-Ldir Add directory dir to the list of directories to be
searched for -l.</p>

<p>-Bprefix This option specifies where to find the
executables, libraries, include files, and data files of the
compiler itself.</p>

<p>The compiler driver program runs one or more of the
subprograms cpp, cc1, as and ld. It tries prefix as a prefix
for each program it tries to run, both with and without
machine/version/.</p>

<p>For each subprogram to be run, the compiler driver first
tries the -B prefix, if any. If that name is not found, or
if -B was not specified, the driver tries two standard
prefixes, which are /usr/lib/gcc/ and /usr/local/lib/gcc/.
If neither of those results in a file name that is found,
the unmodified program name is searched for using the
directories specified in your PATH environment variable.</p>

<p>The compiler will check to see if the path provided by
the -B refers to a directory, and if necessary it will add a
directory separator character at the end of the path.</p>

<p>-B prefixes that effectively specify directory names
also apply to libraries in the linker, because the compiler
translates these options into -L options for the linker.
They also apply to includes files in the preprocessor,
because the compiler translates these options into -isystem
options for the preprocessor. In this case, the compiler
appends include to the prefix.</p>

<p>The run-time support file libgcc.a can also be searched
for using the -B prefix, if needed. If it is not found
there, the two standard prefixes above are tried, and that
is all. The file is left out of the link if it is not found
by those means.</p>

<p>Another way to specify a prefix much like the -B prefix
is to use the environment variable GCC_EXEC_PREFIX.</p>

<p>As a special kludge, if the path provided by -B is
[dir/]stageN/, where N is a number in the range 0 to 9, then
it will be replaced by [dir/]include. This is to help with
boot-strapping the compiler.</p>

<p>-specs=file Process file after the compiler reads in the
standard specs file, in order to override the defaults that
the gcc driver program uses when determining what switches
to pass to cc1, cc1plus, as, ld, etc. More than one
-specs=file can be specified on the command line, and they
are processed in order, from left to right.</p>

<p>--sysroot=dir Use dir as the logical root directory for
headers and libraries. For example, if the compiler would
normally search for headers in /usr/include and libraries in
/usr/lib, it will instead search dir/usr/include and
dir/usr/lib.</p>

<p>If you use both this option and the -isysroot option,
then the --sysroot option will apply to libraries, but the
-isysroot option will apply to header files.</p>

<p>The GNU linker (beginning with version 2.16) has the
necessary support for this option. If your linker does not
support this option, the header file aspect of --sysroot
will still work, but the library aspect will not.</p>

<p>-I- This option has been deprecated. Please use -iquote
instead for -I directories before the -I- and remove the
-I-. Any directories you specify with -I options before the
-I- option are searched only for the case of #include
&quot;file&quot;; they are not searched for #include
&lt;file&gt;.</p>

<p>If additional directories are specified with -I options
after the -I-, these directories are searched for all
#include directives. (Ordinarily all -I directories are used
this way.)</p>

<p>In addition, the -I- option inhibits the use of the
current directory (where the current input file came from)
as the first search directory for #include &quot;file&quot;.
There is no way to override this effect of -I-. With -I. you
can specify searching the directory which was current when
the compiler was invoked. That is not exactly the same as
what the preprocessor does by default, but it is often
satisfactory.</p>

<p>-I- does not inhibit the use of the standard system
directories for header files. Thus, -I- and -nostdinc are
independent.</p>

<p>Specifying Target Machine and Compiler Version The usual
way to run GCC is to run the executable called gcc, or
&lt;machine&gt;-gcc when cross-compiling, or
&lt;machine&gt;-gcc-&lt;version&gt; to run a version other
than the one that was installed last. Sometimes this is
inconvenient, so GCC provides options that will switch to
another cross-compiler or version.</p>

<p>-b machine The argument machine specifies the target
machine for compilation.</p>

<p>The value to use for machine is the same as was
specified as the machine type when configuring GCC as a
cross-compiler. For example, if a cross-compiler was
configured with configure arm-elf, meaning to compile for an
arm processor with elf binaries, then you would specify -b
arm-elf to run that cross compiler. Because there are other
options beginning with -b, the configuration must contain a
hyphen, or -b alone should be one argument followed by the
configuration in the next argument.</p>

<p>-V version The argument version specifies which version
of GCC to run. This is useful when multiple versions are
installed. For example, version might be 4.0, meaning to run
GCC version 4.0.</p>

<p>The -V and -b options work by running the
&lt;machine&gt;-gcc-&lt;version&gt; executable, so theres no
real reason to use them if you can just run that
directly.</p>

<p>Hardware Models and Configurations Earlier we discussed
the standard option -b which chooses among different
installed compilers for completely different target
machines, such as VAX vs. 68000 vs. 80386.</p>

<p>In addition, each of these target machine types can have
its own special options, starting with -m, to choose among
various hardware models or configurations---for example,
68010 vs 68020, floating coprocessor or none. A single
installed version of the compiler can compile for any model
or configuration, according to the options specified.</p>

<p>Some configurations of the compiler also support
additional special options, usually for compatibility with
other compilers on the same platform.</p>

<p>ARC Options These options are defined for ARC
implementations:</p>

<p>-EL Compile code for little endian mode. This is the
default.</p>

<p>-EB Compile code for big endian mode.</p>

<p>-mmangle-cpu Prepend the name of the cpu to all public
symbol names. In multiple-processor systems, there are many
ARC variants with different instruction and register set
characteristics. This flag prevents code compiled for one
cpu to be linked with code compiled for another. No facility
exists for handling variants that are &quot;almost
identical&quot;. This is an all or nothing option.</p>

<p>-mcpu=cpu Compile code for ARC variant cpu. Which
variants are supported depend on the configuration. All
variants support -mcpu=base, this is the default.</p>

<p>-mtext=text-section -mdata=data-section
-mrodata=readonly-data-section Put functions, data, and
readonly data in text-section, data- section, and
readonly-data-section respectively by default. This can be
overridden with the &quot;section&quot; attribute.</p>

<p>-mfix-cortex-m3-ldrd Some Cortex-M3 cores can cause data
corruption when &quot;ldrd&quot; instructions with
overlapping destination and base registers are used. This
option avoids generating these instructions. This option is
enabled by default when -mcpu=cortex-m3 is specified.</p>

<p>ARM Options These -m options are defined for Advanced
RISC Machines (ARM) architectures:</p>

<p>-mabi=name Generate code for the specified ABI.
Permissible values are: apcs- gnu, atpcs, aapcs, aapcs-linux
and iwmmxt.</p>

<p>-mapcs-frame Generate a stack frame that is compliant
with the ARM Procedure Call Standard for all functions, even
if this is not strictly necessary for correct execution of
the code. Specifying -fomit-frame-pointer with this option
will cause the stack frames not to be generated for leaf
functions. The default is -mno-apcs-frame.</p>

<p>-mapcs This is a synonym for -mapcs-frame.</p>

<p>-mthumb-interwork Generate code which supports calling
between the ARM and Thumb instruction sets. Without this
option the two instruction sets cannot be reliably used
inside one program. The default is -mno-thumb-interwork,
since slightly larger code is generated when
-mthumb-interwork is specified.</p>

<p>-mno-sched-prolog Prevent the reordering of instructions
in the function prolog, or the merging of those instruction
with the instructions in the functions body. This means that
all functions will start with a recognizable set of
instructions (or in fact one of a choice from a small set of
different function prologues), and this information can be
used to locate the start if functions inside an executable
piece of code. The default is -msched-prolog.</p>

<p>-mfloat-abi=name Specifies which floating-point ABI to
use. Permissible values are: soft, softfp and hard.</p>

<p>Specifying soft causes GCC to generate output containing
library calls for floating-point operations. softfp allows
the generation of code using hardware floating-point
instructions, but still uses the soft-float calling
conventions. hard allows generation of floating-point
instructions and uses FPU-specific calling conventions.</p>

<p>Using -mfloat-abi=hard with VFP coprocessors is not
supported. Use -mfloat-abi=softfp with the appropriate -mfpu
option to allow the compiler to generate code that makes use
of the hardware floating- point capabilities for these
CPUs.</p>

<p>The default depends on the specific target
configuration. Note that the hard-float and soft-float ABIs
are not link-compatible; you must compile your entire
program with the same ABI, and link with a compatible set of
libraries.</p>

<p>-mhard-float Equivalent to -mfloat-abi=hard.</p>

<p>-msoft-float Equivalent to -mfloat-abi=soft.</p>

<p>-mlittle-endian Generate code for a processor running in
little-endian mode. This is the default for all standard
configurations.</p>

<p>-mbig-endian Generate code for a processor running in
big-endian mode; the default is to compile code for a
little-endian processor.</p>

<p>-mwords-little-endian This option only applies when
generating code for big-endian processors. Generate code for
a little-endian word order but a big-endian byte order. That
is, a byte order of the form 32107654. Note: this option
should only be used if you require compatibility with code
for big-endian ARM processors generated by versions of the
compiler prior to 2.8.</p>

<p>-mcpu=name This specifies the name of the target ARM
processor. GCC uses this name to determine what kind of
instructions it can emit when generating assembly code.
Permissible names are: arm2, arm250, arm3, arm6, arm60,
arm600, arm610, arm620, arm7, arm7m, arm7d, arm7dm, arm7di,
arm7dmi, arm70, arm700, arm700i, arm710, arm710c, arm7100,
arm720, arm7500, arm7500fe, arm7tdmi, arm7tdmi-s, arm710t,
arm720t, arm740t, strongarm, strongarm110, strongarm1100,
strongarm1110, arm8, arm810, arm9, arm9e, arm920, arm920t,
arm922t, arm946e-s, arm966e-s, arm968e-s, arm926ej-s,
arm940t, arm9tdmi, arm10tdmi, arm1020t, arm1026ej-s, arm10e,
arm1020e, arm1022e, arm1136j-s, arm1136jf-s, mpcore,
mpcorenovfp, arm1156t2-s, arm1176jz-s, arm1176jzf-s,
cortex-a8, cortex-a9, cortex-r4, cortex-r4f, cortex-m3,
cortex-m1, xscale, iwmmxt, iwmmxt2, ep9312.</p>

<p>-mtune=name This option is very similar to the -mcpu=
option, except that instead of specifying the actual target
processor type, and hence restricting which instructions can
be used, it specifies that GCC should tune the performance
of the code as if the target were of the type specified in
this option, but still choosing the instructions that it
will generate based on the cpu specified by a -mcpu= option.
For some ARM implementations better performance can be
obtained by using this option.</p>

<p>-march=name This specifies the name of the target ARM
architecture. GCC uses this name to determine what kind of
instructions it can emit when generating assembly code. This
option can be used in conjunction with or instead of the
-mcpu= option. Permissible names are: armv2, armv2a, armv3,
armv3m, armv4, armv4t, armv5, armv5t, armv5e, armv5te,
armv6, armv6j, armv6t2, armv6z, armv6zk, armv6-m, armv7,
armv7-a, armv7-r, armv7-m, iwmmxt, iwmmxt2, ep9312.</p>

<p>-mfpu=name -mfpe=number -mfp=number This specifies what
floating point hardware (or hardware emulation) is available
on the target. Permissible names are: fpa, fpe2, fpe3,
maverick, vfp, vfpv3, vfpv3-d16 and neon. -mfp and -mfpe are
synonyms for -mfpu=fpenumber, for compatibility with older
versions of GCC.</p>

<p>If -msoft-float is specified this specifies the format
of floating point values.</p>

<p>-mstructure-size-boundary=n The size of all structures
and unions will be rounded up to a multiple of the number of
bits set by this option. Permissible values are 8, 32 and
64. The default value varies for different toolchains. For
the COFF targeted toolchain the default value is 8. A value
of 64 is only allowed if the underlying ABI supports it.</p>

<p>Specifying the larger number can produce faster, more
efficient code, but can also increase the size of the
program. Different values are potentially incompatible. Code
compiled with one value cannot necessarily expect to work
with code or libraries compiled with another value, if they
exchange information using structures or unions.</p>

<p>-mabort-on-noreturn Generate a call to the function
&quot;abort&quot; at the end of a &quot;noreturn&quot;
function. It will be executed if the function tries to
return.</p>

<p>-mlong-calls -mno-long-calls Tells the compiler to
perform function calls by first loading the address of the
function into a register and then performing a subroutine
call on this register. This switch is needed if the target
function will lie outside of the 64 megabyte addressing
range of the offset based version of subroutine call
instruction.</p>

<p>Even if this switch is enabled, not all function calls
will be turned into long calls. The heuristic is that static
functions, functions which have the short-call attribute,
functions that are inside the scope of a #pragma
no_long_calls directive and functions whose definitions have
already been compiled within the current compilation unit,
will not be turned into long calls. The exception to this
rule is that weak function definitions, functions with the
long-call attribute or the section attribute, and functions
that are within the scope of a #pragma long_calls directive,
will always be turned into long calls.</p>

<p>This feature is not enabled by default. Specifying
-mno-long-calls will restore the default behavior, as will
placing the function calls within the scope of a #pragma
long_calls_off directive. Note these switches have no effect
on how the compiler generates code to handle function calls
via function pointers.</p>

<p>-msingle-pic-base Treat the register used for PIC
addressing as read-only, rather than loading it in the
prologue for each function. The run-time system is
responsible for initializing this register with an
appropriate value before execution begins.</p>

<p>-mpic-register=reg Specify the register to be used for
PIC addressing. The default is R10 unless stack-checking is
enabled, when R9 is used.</p>

<p>-mcirrus-fix-invalid-insns Insert NOPs into the
instruction stream to in order to work around problems with
invalid Maverick instruction combinations. This option is
only valid if the -mcpu=ep9312 option has been used to
enable generation of instructions for the Cirrus Maverick
floating point co-processor. This option is not enabled by
default, since the problem is only present in older Maverick
implementations. The default can be re-enabled by use of the
-mno-cirrus-fix-invalid-insns switch.</p>

<p>-mpoke-function-name Write the name of each function
into the text section, directly preceding the function
prologue. The generated code is similar to this:</p>

<p>t0 .ascii &quot;arm_poke_function_name&quot;, 0 .align
t1 .word 0xff000000 + (t1 - t0) arm_poke_function_name mov
ip, sp stmfd sp!, {fp, ip, lr, pc} sub fp, ip, #4</p>

<p>When performing a stack backtrace, code can inspect the
value of &quot;pc&quot; stored at &quot;fp + 0&quot;. If the
trace function then looks at location &quot;pc - 12&quot;
and the top 8 bits are set, then we know that there is a
function name embedded immediately preceding this location
and has length &quot;((pc[-3]) &amp; 0xff000000)&quot;.</p>

<p>-mthumb Generate code for the Thumb instruction set. The
default is to use the 32-bit ARM instruction set. This
option automatically enables either 16-bit Thumb-1 or mixed
16/32-bit Thumb-2 instructions based on the -mcpu=name and
-march=name options.</p>

<p>-mtpcs-frame Generate a stack frame that is compliant
with the Thumb Procedure Call Standard for all non-leaf
functions. (A leaf function is one that does not call any
other functions.) The default is -mno-tpcs-frame.</p>

<p>-mtpcs-leaf-frame Generate a stack frame that is
compliant with the Thumb Procedure Call Standard for all
leaf functions. (A leaf function is one that does not call
any other functions.) The default is
-mno-apcs-leaf-frame.</p>

<p>-mcallee-super-interworking Gives all externally visible
functions in the file being compiled an ARM instruction set
header which switches to Thumb mode before executing the
rest of the function. This allows these functions to be
called from non-interworking code.</p>

<p>-mcaller-super-interworking Allows calls via function
pointers (including virtual functions) to execute correctly
regardless of whether the target code has been compiled for
interworking or not. There is a small overhead in the cost
of executing a function pointer if this option is
enabled.</p>

<p>-mtp=name Specify the access model for the thread local
storage pointer. The valid models are soft, which generates
calls to &quot;__aeabi_read_tp&quot;, cp15, which fetches
the thread pointer from &quot;cp15&quot; directly (supported
in the arm6k architecture), and auto, which uses the best
available method for the selected processor. The default
setting is auto.</p>

<p>-mword-relocations Only generate absolute relocations on
word sized values (i.e. R_ARM_ABS32). This is enabled by
default on targets (uClinux, SymbianOS) where the runtime
loader imposes this restriction, and when -fpic or -fPIC is
specified.</p>

<p>AVR Options These options are defined for AVR
implementations:</p>

<p>-mmcu=mcu Specify ATMEL AVR instruction set or MCU
type.</p>

<p>Instruction set avr1 is for the minimal AVR core, not
supported by the C compiler, only for assembler programs
(MCU types: at90s1200, attiny10, attiny11, attiny12,
attiny15, attiny28).</p>

<p>Instruction set avr2 (default) is for the classic AVR
core with up to 8K program memory space (MCU types:
at90s2313, at90s2323, attiny22, at90s2333, at90s2343,
at90s4414, at90s4433, at90s4434, at90s8515, at90c8534,
at90s8535).</p>

<p>Instruction set avr3 is for the classic AVR core with up
to 128K program memory space (MCU types: atmega103,
atmega603, at43usb320, at76c711).</p>

<p>Instruction set avr4 is for the enhanced AVR core with
up to 8K program memory space (MCU types: atmega8, atmega83,
atmega85).</p>

<p>Instruction set avr5 is for the enhanced AVR core with
up to 128K program memory space (MCU types: atmega16,
atmega161, atmega163, atmega32, atmega323, atmega64,
atmega128, at43usb355, at94k).</p>

<p>-msize Output instruction sizes to the asm file.</p>

<p>-mno-interrupts Generated code is not compatible with
hardware interrupts. Code size will be smaller.</p>

<p>-mcall-prologues Functions prologues/epilogues expanded
as call to appropriate subroutines. Code size will be
smaller.</p>

<p>-mno-tablejump Do not generate tablejump insns which
sometimes increase code size. The option is now deprecated
in favor of the equivalent -fno-jump-tables</p>

<p>-mtiny-stack Change only the low 8 bits of the stack
pointer.</p>

<p>-mint8 Assume int to be 8 bit integer. This affects the
sizes of all types: A char will be 1 byte, an int will be 1
byte, an long will be 2 bytes and long long will be 4 bytes.
Please note that this option does not comply to the C
standards, but it will provide you with smaller code
size.</p>

<p>Blackfin Options -mcpu=cpu[-sirevision] Specifies the
name of the target Blackfin processor. Currently, cpu can be
one of bf512, bf514, bf516, bf518, bf522, bf523, bf524,
bf525, bf526, bf527, bf531, bf532, bf533, bf534, bf536,
bf537, bf538, bf539, bf542, bf544, bf547, bf548, bf549,
bf561. The optional sirevision specifies the silicon
revision of the target Blackfin processor. Any workarounds
available for the targeted silicon revision will be enabled.
If sirevision is none, no workarounds are enabled. If
sirevision is any, all workarounds for the targeted
processor will be enabled. The
&quot;__SILICON_REVISION__&quot; macro is defined to two
hexadecimal digits representing the major and minor numbers
in the silicon revision. If sirevision is none, the
&quot;__SILICON_REVISION__&quot; is not defined. If
sirevision is any, the &quot;__SILICON_REVISION__&quot; is
defined to be 0xffff. If this optional sirevision is not
used, GCC assumes the latest known silicon revision of the
targeted Blackfin processor.</p>

<p>Support for bf561 is incomplete. For bf561, Only the
processor macro is defined. Without this option, bf532 is
used as the processor by default. The corresponding
predefined processor macros for cpu is to be defined. And
for bfin-elf toolchain, this causes the hardware BSP
provided by libgloss to be linked in if -msim is not
given.</p>

<p>-msim Specifies that the program will be run on the
simulator. This causes the simulator BSP provided by
libgloss to be linked in. This option has effect only for
bfin-elf toolchain. Certain other options, such as
-mid-shared-library and -mfdpic, imply -msim.</p>

<p>-momit-leaf-frame-pointer Dont keep the frame pointer in
a register for leaf functions. This avoids the instructions
to save, set up and restore frame pointers and makes an
extra register available in leaf functions. The option
-fomit-frame-pointer removes the frame pointer for all
functions which might make debugging harder.</p>

<p>-mspecld-anomaly When enabled, the compiler will ensure
that the generated code does not contain speculative loads
after jump instructions. If this option is used,
&quot;__WORKAROUND_SPECULATIVE_LOADS&quot; is defined.</p>

<p>-mno-specld-anomaly Don t generate extra code to prevent
speculative loads from occurring.</p>

<p>-mcsync-anomaly When enabled, the compiler will ensure
that the generated code does not contain CSYNC or SSYNC
instructions too soon after conditional branches. If this
option is used, &quot;__WORKAROUND_SPECULATIVE_SYNCS&quot;
is defined.</p>

<p>-mno-csync-anomaly Don t generate extra code to prevent
CSYNC or SSYNC instructions from occurring too soon after a
conditional branch.</p>

<p>-mlow-64k When enabled, the compiler is free to take
advantage of the knowledge that the entire program fits into
the low 64k of memory.</p>

<p>-mno-low-64k Assume that the program is arbitrarily
large. This is the default.</p>

<p>-mstack-check-l1 Do stack checking using information
placed into L1 scratchpad memory by the uClinux kernel.</p>

<p>-mid-shared-library Generate code that supports shared
libraries via the library ID method. This allows for execute
in place and shared libraries in an environment without
virtual memory management. This option implies -fPIC. With a
bfin-elf target, this option implies -msim.</p>

<p>-mno-id-shared-library Generate code that doesn t assume
ID based shared libraries are being used. This is the
default.</p>

<p>-mleaf-id-shared-library Generate code that supports
shared libraries via the library ID method, but assumes that
this library or executable wont link against any other ID
shared libraries. That allows the compiler to use faster
code for jumps and calls.</p>

<p>-mno-leaf-id-shared-library Do not assume that the code
being compiled won t link against any ID shared libraries.
Slower code will be generated for jump and call insns.</p>

<p>-mshared-library-id=n Specified the identification
number of the ID based shared library being compiled.
Specifying a value of 0 will generate more compact code,
specifying other values will force the allocation of that
number to the current library but is no more space or time
efficient than omitting this option.</p>

<p>-msep-data Generate code that allows the data segment to
be located in a different area of memory from the text
segment. This allows for execute in place in an environment
without virtual memory management by eliminating relocations
against the text section.</p>

<p>-mno-sep-data Generate code that assumes that the data
segment follows the text segment. This is the default.</p>

<p>-mlong-calls -mno-long-calls Tells the compiler to
perform function calls by first loading the address of the
function into a register and then performing a subroutine
call on this register. This switch is needed if the target
function will lie outside of the 24 bit addressing range of
the offset based version of subroutine call instruction.</p>

<p>This feature is not enabled by default. Specifying
-mno-long-calls will restore the default behavior. Note
these switches have no effect on how the compiler generates
code to handle function calls via function pointers.</p>

<p>-mfast-fp Link with the fast floating-point library.
This library relaxes some of the IEEE floating-point
standard s rules for checking inputs against Not-a-Number
(NAN), in the interest of performance.</p>

<p>-minline-plt Enable inlining of PLT entries in function
calls to functions that are not known to bind locally. It
has no effect without -mfdpic.</p>

<p>-mmulticore Build standalone application for multicore
Blackfin processor. Proper start files and link scripts will
be used to support multicore. This option defines
&quot;__BFIN_MULTICORE&quot;. It can only be used with
-mcpu=bf561[-sirevision]. It can be used with -mcorea or
-mcoreb. If it s used without -mcorea or -mcoreb, single
application/dual core programming model is used. In this
model, the main function of Core B should be named as
coreb_main. If its used with -mcorea or -mcoreb, one
application per core programming model is used. If this
option is not used, single core application programming
model is used.</p>

<p>-mcorea Build standalone application for Core A of BF561
when using one application per core programming model.
Proper start files and link scripts will be used to support
Core A. This option defines &quot;__BFIN_COREA&quot;. It
must be used with -mmulticore.</p>

<p>-mcoreb Build standalone application for Core B of BF561
when using one application per core programming model.
Proper start files and link scripts will be used to support
Core B. This option defines &quot;__BFIN_COREB&quot;. When
this option is used, coreb_main should be used instead of
main. It must be used with -mmulticore.</p>

<p>-msdram Build standalone application for SDRAM. Proper
start files and link scripts will be used to put the
application into SDRAM. Loader should initialize SDRAM
before loading the application into SDRAM. This option
defines &quot;__BFIN_SDRAM&quot;.</p>

<p>-micplb Assume that ICPLBs are enabled at runtime. This
has an effect on certain anomaly workarounds. For Linux
targets, the default is to assume ICPLBs are enabled; for
standalone applications the default is off.</p>

<p>CRIS Options These options are defined specifically for
the CRIS ports.</p>

<p>-march=architecture-type -mcpu=architecture-type
Generate code for the specified architecture. The choices
for architecture-type are v3, v8 and v10 for respectively
ETRAX 4, ETRAX 100, and ETRAX 100 LX. Default is v0 except
for cris-axis- linux-gnu, where the default is v10.</p>

<p>-mtune=architecture-type Tune to architecture-type
everything applicable about the generated code, except for
the ABI and the set of available instructions. The choices
for architecture-type are the same as for
-march=architecture-type.</p>

<p>-mmax-stack-frame=n Warn when the stack frame of a
function exceeds n bytes.</p>

<p>-metrax4 -metrax100 The options -metrax4 and -metrax100
are synonyms for -march=v3 and -march=v8 respectively.</p>

<p>-mmul-bug-workaround -mno-mul-bug-workaround Work around
a bug in the &quot;muls&quot; and &quot;mulu&quot;
instructions for CPU models where it applies. This option is
active by default.</p>

<p>-mpdebug Enable CRIS-specific verbose debug-related
information in the assembly code. This option also has the
effect to turn off the #NO_APP formatted-code indicator to
the assembler at the beginning of the assembly file.</p>

<p>-mcc-init Do not use condition-code results from
previous instruction; always emit compare and test
instructions before use of condition codes.</p>

<p>-mno-side-effects Do not emit instructions with
side-effects in addressing modes other than
post-increment.</p>

<p>-mstack-align -mno-stack-align -mdata-align
-mno-data-align -mconst-align -mno-const-align These options
(no-options) arranges (eliminate arrangements) for the
stack-frame, individual data and constants to be aligned for
the maximum single data access size for the chosen CPU
model. The default is to arrange for 32-bit alignment. ABI
details such as structure layout are not affected by these
options.</p>

<p>-m32-bit -m16-bit -m8-bit Similar to the stack- data-
and const-align options above, these options arrange for
stack-frame, writable data and constants to all be 32-bit,
16-bit or 8-bit aligned. The default is 32-bit
alignment.</p>

<p>-mno-prologue-epilogue -mprologue-epilogue With
-mno-prologue-epilogue, the normal function prologue and
epilogue that sets up the stack-frame are omitted and no
return instructions or return sequences are generated in the
code. Use this option only together with visual inspection
of the compiled code: no warnings or errors are generated
when call-saved registers must be saved, or storage for
local variable needs to be allocated.</p>

<p>-mno-gotplt -mgotplt With -fpic and -fPIC, don t
generate (do generate) instruction sequences that load
addresses for functions from the PLT part of the GOT rather
than (traditional on other architectures) calls to the PLT.
The default is -mgotplt.</p>

<p>-melf Legacy no-op option only recognized with the
cris-axis-elf and cris-axis-linux-gnu targets.</p>

<p>-mlinux Legacy no-op option only recognized with the
cris-axis-linux-gnu target.</p>

<p>-sim This option, recognized for the cris-axis-elf
arranges to link with input-output functions from a
simulator library. Code, initialized data and
zero-initialized data are allocated consecutively.</p>

<p>-sim2 Like -sim, but pass linker options to locate
initialized data at 0x40000000 and zero-initialized data at
0x80000000.</p>

<p>CRX Options These options are defined specifically for
the CRX ports.</p>

<p>-mmac Enable the use of multiply-accumulate
instructions. Disabled by default.</p>

<p>-mpush-args Push instructions will be used to pass
outgoing arguments when functions are called. Enabled by
default.</p>

<p>Darwin Options These options are defined for all
architectures running the Darwin operating system.</p>

<p>FSF GCC on Darwin does not create &quot;fat&quot; object
files; it will create an object file for the single
architecture that it was built to target. Apples GCC on
Darwin does create &quot;fat&quot; files if multiple -arch
options are used; it does so by running the compiler or
linker multiple times and joining the results together with
lipo.</p>

<p>The subtype of the file created (like ppc7400 or ppc970
or i686) is determined by the flags that specify the ISA
that GCC is targetting, like -mcpu or -march. The
-force_cpusubtype_ALL option can be used to override
this.</p>

<p>The Darwin tools vary in their behavior when presented
with an ISA mismatch. The assembler, as, will only permit
instructions to be used that are valid for the subtype of
the file it is generating, so you cannot put 64-bit
instructions in an ppc750 object file. The linker for shared
libraries, /usr/bin/libtool, will fail and print an error if
asked to create a shared library with a less restrictive
subtype than its input files (for instance, trying to put a
ppc970 object file in a ppc7400 library). The linker for
executables, ld, will quietly give the executable the most
restrictive subtype of any of its input files.</p>

<p>-Fdir Add the framework directory dir to the head of the
list of directories to be searched for header files. These
directories are interleaved with those specified by -I
options and are scanned in a left-to-right order.</p>

<p>A framework directory is a directory with frameworks in
it. A framework is a directory with a &quot;Headers&quot;
and/or &quot;PrivateHeaders&quot; directory contained
directly in it that ends in &quot;.framework&quot;. The name
of a framework is the name of this directory excluding the
&quot;.framework&quot;. Headers associated with the
framework are found in one of those two directories, with
&quot;Headers&quot; being searched first. A subframework is
a framework directory that is in a frameworks
&quot;Frameworks&quot; directory. Includes of subframework
headers can only appear in a header of a framework that
contains the subframework, or in a sibling subframework
header. Two subframeworks are siblings if they occur in the
same framework. A subframework should not have the same name
as a framework, a warning will be issued if this is
violated. Currently a subframework cannot have
subframeworks, in the future, the mechanism may be extended
to support this. The standard frameworks can be found in
&quot;/System/Library/Frameworks&quot; and
&quot;/Library/Frameworks&quot;. An example include looks
like &quot;#include &lt;Framework/header.h&gt;&quot;, where
Framework denotes the name of the framework and header.h is
found in the &quot;PrivateHeaders&quot; or
&quot;Headers&quot; directory.</p>

<p>-iframeworkdir Like -F except the directory is a treated
as a system directory. The main difference between this
-iframework and -F is that with -iframework the compiler
does not warn about constructs contained within header files
found via dir. This option is valid only for the C family of
languages.</p>

<p>-gused Emit debugging information for symbols that are
used. For STABS debugging format, this enables
-feliminate-unused-debug-symbols. This is by default ON.</p>

<p>-gfull Emit debugging information for all symbols and
types.</p>

<p>-mmacosx-version-min=version The earliest version of
MacOS X that this executable will run on is version. Typical
values of version include 10.1, 10.2, and 10.3.9.</p>

<p>If the compiler was built to use the system s headers by
default, then the default for this option is the system
version on which the compiler is running, otherwise the
default is to make choices which are compatible with as many
systems and code bases as possible.</p>

<p>-mkernel Enable kernel development mode. The -mkernel
option sets -static, -fno-common, -fno-cxa-atexit,
-fno-exceptions, -fno-non-call-exceptions, -fapple-kext,
-fno-weak and -fno-rtti where applicable. This mode also
sets -mno-altivec, -msoft-float, -fno-builtin and
-mlong-branch for PowerPC targets.</p>

<p>-mone-byte-bool Override the defaults for bool so that
sizeof(bool)==1. By default sizeof(bool) is 4 when compiling
for Darwin/PowerPC and 1 when compiling for Darwin/x86, so
this option has no effect on x86.</p>

<p>Warning: The -mone-byte-bool switch causes GCC to
generate code that is not binary compatible with code
generated without that switch. Using this switch may require
recompiling all other modules in a program, including system
libraries. Use this switch to conform to a non-default data
model.</p>

<p>-mfix-and-continue -ffix-and-continue -findirect-data
Generate code suitable for fast turn around development.
Needed to enable gdb to dynamically load &quot;.o&quot;
files into already running programs. -findirect-data and
-ffix-and-continue are provided for backwards
compatibility.</p>

<p>-all_load Loads all members of static archive libraries.
See man ld(1) for more information.</p>

<p>-arch_errors_fatal Cause the errors having to do with
files that have the wrong architecture to be fatal.</p>

<p>-bind_at_load Causes the output file to be marked such
that the dynamic linker will bind all undefined references
when the file is loaded or launched.</p>

<p>-bundle Produce a Mach-o bundle format file. See man
ld(1) for more information.</p>

<p>-bundle_loader executable This option specifies the
executable that will be loading the build output file being
linked. See man ld(1) for more information.</p>

<p>-dynamiclib When passed this option, GCC will produce a
dynamic library instead of an executable when linking, using
the Darwin libtool command.</p>

<p>-force_cpusubtype_ALL This causes GCCs output file to
have the ALL subtype, instead of one controlled by the -mcpu
or -march option.</p>

<p>-allowable_client client_name -client_name
-compatibility_version -current_version -dead_strip
-dependency-file -dylib_file -dylinker_install_name -dynamic
-exported_symbols_list -filelist -flat_namespace

-segs_read_only_addr -segs_read_write_addr -single_module
-static -sub_library -sub_umbrella -twolevel_namespace
-umbrella -undefined -unexported_symbols_list
-weak_reference_mismatches -whatsloaded These options are
passed to the Darwin linker. The Darwin linker man page
describes them in detail.</p>

<p>DEC Alpha Options These -m options are defined for the
DEC Alpha implementations:</p>

<p>-mno-soft-float -msoft-float Use (do not use) the
hardware floating-point instructions for floating-point
operations. When -msoft-float is specified, functions in
libgcc.a will be used to perform floating-point operations.
Unless they are replaced by routines that emulate the
floating-point operations, or compiled in such a way as to
call such emulations routines, these routines will issue
floating-point operations. If you are compiling for an Alpha
without floating- point operations, you must ensure that the
library is built so as not to call them.</p>

<p>Note that Alpha implementations without floating-point
operations are required to have floating-point
registers.</p>

<p>-mfp-reg -mno-fp-regs Generate code that uses (does not
use) the floating-point register set. -mno-fp-regs implies
-msoft-float. If the floating-point register set is not
used, floating point operands are passed in integer
registers as if they were integers and floating-point
results are passed in $0 instead of $f0. This is a
non-standard calling sequence, so any function with a
floating-point argument or return value called by code
compiled with -mno-fp-regs must also be compiled with that
option.</p>

<p>A typical use of this option is building a kernel that
does not use, and hence need not save and restore, any
floating-point registers.</p>

<p>-mieee The Alpha architecture implements floating-point
hardware optimized for maximum performance. It is mostly
compliant with the IEEE floating point standard. However,
for full compliance, software assistance is required. This
option generates code fully IEEE compliant code except that
the inexact-flag is not maintained (see below). If this
option is turned on, the preprocessor macro
&quot;_IEEE_FP&quot; is defined during compilation. The
resulting code is less efficient but is able to correctly
support denormalized numbers and exceptional IEEE values
such as not-a-number and plus/minus infinity. Other Alpha
compilers call this option -ieee_with_no_inexact.</p>

<p>-mieee-with-inexact This is like -mieee except the
generated code also maintains the IEEE inexact-flag. Turning
on this option causes the generated code to implement
fully-compliant IEEE math. In addition to
&quot;_IEEE_FP&quot;, &quot;_IEEE_FP_EXACT&quot; is defined
as a preprocessor macro. On some Alpha implementations the
resulting code may execute significantly slower than the
code generated by default. Since there is very little code
that depends on the inexact-flag, you should normally not
specify this option. Other Alpha compilers call this option
-ieee_with_inexact.</p>

<p>-mfp-trap-mode=trap-mode This option controls what
floating-point related traps are enabled. Other Alpha
compilers call this option -fptm trap-mode. The trap mode
can be set to one of four values:</p>

<p>n This is the default (normal) setting. The only traps
that are enabled are the ones that cannot be disabled in
software (e.g., division by zero trap).</p>

<p>u In addition to the traps enabled by n, underflow traps
are enabled as well.</p>

<p>su Like u, but the instructions are marked to be safe
for software completion (see Alpha architecture manual for
details).</p>

<p>sui Like su, but inexact traps are enabled as well.</p>

<p>-mfp-rounding-mode=rounding-mode Selects the IEEE
rounding mode. Other Alpha compilers call this option -fprm
rounding-mode. The rounding-mode can be one of:</p>

<p>n Normal IEEE rounding mode. Floating point numbers are
rounded towards the nearest machine number or towards the
even machine number in case of a tie.</p>

<p>m Round towards minus infinity.</p>

<p>c Chopped rounding mode. Floating point numbers are
rounded towards zero.</p>

<p>d Dynamic rounding mode. A field in the floating point
control register (fpcr, see Alpha architecture reference
manual) controls the rounding mode in effect. The C library
initializes this register for rounding towards plus
infinity. Thus, unless your program modifies the fpcr, d
corresponds to round towards plus infinity.</p>

<p>-mtrap-precision=trap-precision In the Alpha
architecture, floating point traps are imprecise. This means
without software assistance it is impossible to recover from
a floating trap and program execution normally needs to be
terminated. GCC can generate code that can assist operating
system trap handlers in determining the exact location that
caused a floating point trap. Depending on the requirements
of an application, different levels of precisions can be
selected:</p>

<p>p Program precision. This option is the default and
means a trap handler can only identify which program caused
a floating point exception.</p>

<p>f Function precision. The trap handler can determine the
function that caused a floating point exception.</p>

<p>i Instruction precision. The trap handler can determine
the exact instruction that caused a floating point
exception.</p>

<p>Other Alpha compilers provide the equivalent options
called -scope_safe and -resumption_safe.</p>

<p>-mieee-conformant This option marks the generated code
as IEEE conformant. You must not use this option unless you
also specify -mtrap-precision=i and either -mfp-trap-mode=su
or -mfp-trap-mode=sui. Its only effect is to emit the line
.eflag 48 in the function prologue of the generated assembly
file. Under DEC Unix, this has the effect that
IEEE-conformant math library routines will be linked in.</p>

<p>-mbuild-constants Normally GCC examines a 32- or 64-bit
integer constant to see if it can construct it from smaller
constants in two or three instructions. If it cannot, it
will output the constant as a literal and generate code to
load it from the data segment at runtime.</p>

<p>Use this option to require GCC to construct all integer
constants using code, even if it takes more instructions
(the maximum is six).</p>

<p>You would typically use this option to build a shared
library dynamic loader. Itself a shared library, it must
relocate itself in memory before it can find the variables
and constants in its own data segment.</p>

<p>-malpha-as -mgas Select whether to generate code to be
assembled by the vendor- supplied assembler (-malpha-as) or
by the GNU assembler -mgas.</p>

<p>-mbwx -mno-bwx -mcix -mno-cix -mfix -mno-fix -mmax
-mno-max Indicate whether GCC should generate code to use
the optional BWX, CIX, FIX and MAX instruction sets. The
default is to use the instruction sets supported by the CPU
type specified via -mcpu= option or that of the CPU on which
GCC was built if none was specified.</p>

<p>-mfloat-vax -mfloat-ieee Generate code that uses (does
not use) VAX F and G floating point arithmetic instead of
IEEE single and double precision.</p>

<p>-mexplicit-relocs -mno-explicit-relocs Older Alpha
assemblers provided no way to generate symbol relocations
except via assembler macros. Use of these macros does not
allow optimal instruction scheduling. GNU binutils as of
version 2.12 supports a new syntax that allows the compiler
to explicitly mark which relocations should apply to which
instructions. This option is mostly useful for debugging, as
GCC detects the capabilities of the assembler when it is
built and sets the default accordingly.</p>

<p>-msmall-data -mlarge-data When -mexplicit-relocs is in
effect, static data is accessed via gp-relative relocations.
When -msmall-data is used, objects 8 bytes long or smaller
are placed in a small data area (the &quot;.sdata&quot; and
&quot;.sbss&quot; sections) and are accessed via 16-bit
relocations off of the $gp register. This limits the size of
the small data area to 64KB, but allows the variables to be
directly accessed via a single instruction.</p>

<p>The default is -mlarge-data. With this option the data
area is limited to just below 2GB. Programs that require
more than 2GB of data must use &quot;malloc&quot; or
&quot;mmap&quot; to allocate the data in the heap instead of
in the programs data segment.</p>

<p>When generating code for shared libraries, -fpic implies
-msmall-data and -fPIC implies -mlarge-data.</p>

<p>-msmall-text -mlarge-text When -msmall-text is used, the
compiler assumes that the code of the entire program (or
shared library) fits in 4MB, and is thus reachable with a
branch instruction. When -msmall-data is used, the compiler
can assume that all local symbols share the same $gp value,
and thus reduce the number of instructions required for a
function call from 4 to 1.</p>

<p>The default is -mlarge-text.</p>

<p>-mcpu=cpu_type Set the instruction set and instruction
scheduling parameters for machine type cpu_type. You can
specify either the EV style name or the corresponding chip
number. GCC supports scheduling parameters for the EV4, EV5
and EV6 family of processors and will choose the default
values for the instruction set from the processor you
specify. If you do not specify a processor type, GCC will
default to the processor on which the compiler was
built.</p>

<p>Supported values for cpu_type are</p>

<p>ev4 ev45 21064 Schedules as an EV4 and has no
instruction set extensions.</p>

<p>ev5 21164 Schedules as an EV5 and has no instruction set
extensions.</p>

<p>ev56 21164a Schedules as an EV5 and supports the BWX
extension.</p>

<p>pca56 21164pc 21164PC Schedules as an EV5 and supports
the BWX and MAX extensions.</p>

<p>ev6 21264 Schedules as an EV6 and supports the BWX, FIX,
and MAX extensions.</p>

<p>ev67 21264a Schedules as an EV6 and supports the BWX,
CIX, FIX, and MAX extensions.</p>

<p>Native Linux/GNU toolchains also support the value
native, which selects the best architecture option for the
host processor. -mcpu=native has no effect if GCC does not
recognize the processor.</p>

<p>-mtune=cpu_type Set only the instruction scheduling
parameters for machine type cpu_type. The instruction set is
not changed.</p>

<p>Native Linux/GNU toolchains also support the value
native, which selects the best architecture option for the
host processor. -mtune=native has no effect if GCC does not
recognize the processor.</p>

<p>-mmemory-latency=time Sets the latency the scheduler
should assume for typical memory references as seen by the
application. This number is highly dependent on the memory
access patterns used by the application and the size of the
external cache on the machine.</p>

<p>Valid options for time are</p>

<p>number A decimal number representing clock cycles.</p>

<p>L1 L2 L3 main The compiler contains estimates of the
number of clock cycles for &quot;typical&quot; EV4 &amp; EV5
hardware for the Level 1, 2 &amp; 3 caches (also called
Dcache, Scache, and Bcache), as well as to main memory. Note
that L3 is only valid for EV5.</p>

<p>DEC Alpha/VMS Options These -m options are defined for
the DEC Alpha/VMS implementations:</p>

<p>-mvms-return-codes Return VMS condition codes from main.
The default is to return POSIX style condition (e.g. error)
codes.</p>

<p>FR30 Options These options are defined specifically for
the FR30 port.</p>

<p>-msmall-model Use the small address space model. This
can produce smaller code, but it does assume that all
symbolic values and addresses will fit into a 20-bit
range.</p>

<p>-mno-lsim Assume that run-time support has been provided
and so there is no need to include the simulator library
(libsim.a) on the linker command line.</p>

<p>FRV Options -mgpr-32 Only use the first 32 general
purpose registers.</p>

<p>-mgpr-64 Use all 64 general purpose registers.</p>

<p>-mfpr-32 Use only the first 32 floating point
registers.</p>

<p>-mfpr-64 Use all 64 floating point registers</p>

<p>-mhard-float Use hardware instructions for floating
point operations.</p>

<p>-msoft-float Use library routines for floating point
operations.</p>

<p>-malloc-cc Dynamically allocate condition code
registers.</p>

<p>-mfixed-cc Do not try to dynamically allocate condition
code registers, only use &quot;icc0&quot; and
&quot;fcc0&quot;.</p>

<p>-mdword Change ABI to use double word insns.</p>

<p>-mno-dword Do not use double word instructions.</p>

<p>-mdouble Use floating point double instructions.</p>

<p>-mno-double Do not use floating point double
instructions.</p>

<p>-mmedia Use media instructions.</p>

<p>-mno-media Do not use media instructions.</p>

<p>-mmuladd Use multiply and add/subtract instructions.</p>

<p>-mno-muladd Do not use multiply and add/subtract
instructions.</p>

<p>-mfdpic Select the FDPIC ABI, that uses function
descriptors to represent pointers to functions. Without any
PIC/PIE-related options, it implies -fPIE. With -fpic or
-fpie, it assumes GOT entries and small data are within a
12-bit range from the GOT base address; with -fPIC or -fPIE,
GOT offsets are computed with 32 bits. With a bfin-elf
target, this option implies -msim.</p>

<p>-minline-plt Enable inlining of PLT entries in function
calls to functions that are not known to bind locally. It
has no effect without -mfdpic. It s enabled by default if
optimizing for speed and compiling for shared libraries
(i.e., -fPIC or -fpic), or when an optimization option such
as -O3 or above is present in the command line.</p>

<p>-mTLS Assume a large TLS segment when generating
thread-local code.</p>

<p>-mtls Do not assume a large TLS segment when generating
thread-local code.</p>

<p>-mgprel-ro Enable the use of &quot;GPREL&quot;
relocations in the FDPIC ABI for data that is known to be in
read-only sections. Its enabled by default, except for -fpic
or -fpie: even though it may help make the global offset
table smaller, it trades 1 instruction for 4. With -fPIC or
-fPIE, it trades 3 instructions for 4, one of which may be
shared by multiple symbols, and it avoids the need for a GOT
entry for the referenced symbol, so its more likely to be a
win. If it is not, -mno-gprel-ro can be used to disable
it.</p>

<p>-multilib-library-pic Link with the (library, not FD)
pic libraries. It s implied by -mlibrary-pic, as well as by
-fPIC and -fpic without -mfdpic. You should never have to
use it explicitly.</p>

<p>-mlinked-fp Follow the EABI requirement of always
creating a frame pointer whenever a stack frame is
allocated. This option is enabled by default and can be
disabled with -mno-linked-fp.</p>

<p>-mlong-calls Use indirect addressing to call functions
outside the current compilation unit. This allows the
functions to be placed anywhere within the 32-bit address
space.</p>

<p>-malign-labels Try to align labels to an 8-byte boundary
by inserting nops into the previous packet. This option only
has an effect when VLIW packing is enabled. It doesnt create
new packets; it merely adds nops to existing ones.</p>

<p>-mlibrary-pic Generate position-independent EABI
code.</p>

<p>-macc-4 Use only the first four media accumulator
registers.</p>

<p>-macc-8 Use all eight media accumulator registers.</p>

<p>-mpack Pack VLIW instructions.</p>

<p>-mno-pack Do not pack VLIW instructions.</p>

<p>-mno-eflags Do not mark ABI switches in e_flags.</p>

<p>-mcond-move Enable the use of conditional-move
instructions (default).</p>

<p>This switch is mainly for debugging the compiler and
will likely be removed in a future version.</p>

<p>-mno-cond-move Disable the use of conditional-move
instructions.</p>

<p>This switch is mainly for debugging the compiler and
will likely be removed in a future version.</p>

<p>-mscc Enable the use of conditional set instructions
(default).</p>

<p>This switch is mainly for debugging the compiler and
will likely be removed in a future version.</p>

<p>-mno-scc Disable the use of conditional set
instructions.</p>

<p>This switch is mainly for debugging the compiler and
will likely be removed in a future version.</p>

<p>-mcond-exec Enable the use of conditional execution
(default).</p>

<p>This switch is mainly for debugging the compiler and
will likely be removed in a future version.</p>

<p>-mno-cond-exec Disable the use of conditional
execution.</p>

<p>This switch is mainly for debugging the compiler and
will likely be removed in a future version.</p>

<p>-mvliw-branch Run a pass to pack branches into VLIW
instructions (default).</p>

<p>This switch is mainly for debugging the compiler and
will likely be removed in a future version.</p>

<p>-mno-vliw-branch Do not run a pass to pack branches into
VLIW instructions.</p>

<p>This switch is mainly for debugging the compiler and
will likely be removed in a future version.</p>

<p>-mmulti-cond-exec Enable optimization of
&quot;&amp;&amp;&quot; and &quot;||&quot; in conditional
execution (default).</p>

<p>This switch is mainly for debugging the compiler and
will likely be removed in a future version.</p>

<p>-mno-multi-cond-exec Disable optimization of
&quot;&amp;&amp;&quot; and &quot;||&quot; in conditional
execution.</p>

<p>This switch is mainly for debugging the compiler and
will likely be removed in a future version.</p>

<p>-mnested-cond-exec Enable nested conditional execution
optimizations (default).</p>

<p>This switch is mainly for debugging the compiler and
will likely be removed in a future version.</p>

<p>-mno-nested-cond-exec Disable nested conditional
execution optimizations.</p>

<p>This switch is mainly for debugging the compiler and
will likely be removed in a future version.</p>

<p>-moptimize-membar This switch removes redundant
&quot;membar&quot; instructions from the compiler generated
code. It is enabled by default.</p>

<p>-mno-optimize-membar This switch disables the automatic
removal of redundant &quot;membar&quot; instructions from
the generated code.</p>

<p>-mtomcat-stats Cause gas to print out tomcat
statistics.</p>

<p>-mcpu=cpu Select the processor type for which to
generate code. Possible values are frv, fr550, tomcat,
fr500, fr450, fr405, fr400, fr300 and simple.</p>

<p>GNU/Linux Options These -m options are defined for
GNU/Linux targets:</p>

<p>-mglibc Use the GNU C library instead of uClibc. This is
the default except on *-*-linux-*uclibc* targets.</p>

<p>-muclibc Use uClibc instead of the GNU C library. This
is the default on *-*-linux-*uclibc* targets.</p>

<p>H8/300 Options These -m options are defined for the
H8/300 implementations:</p>

<p>-mrelax Shorten some address references at link time,
when possible; uses the linker option -relax.</p>

<p>-mh Generate code for the H8/300H.</p>

<p>-ms Generate code for the H8S.</p>

<p>-mn Generate code for the H8S and H8/300H in the normal
mode. This switch must be used either with -mh or -ms.</p>

<p>-ms2600 Generate code for the H8S/2600. This switch must
be used with -ms.</p>

<p>-mint32 Make &quot;int&quot; data 32 bits by
default.</p>

<p>-malign-300 On the H8/300H and H8S, use the same
alignment rules as for the H8/300. The default for the
H8/300H and H8S is to align longs and floats on 4 byte
boundaries. -malign-300 causes them to be aligned on 2 byte
boundaries. This option has no effect on the H8/300.</p>

<p>HPPA Options These -m options are defined for the HPPA
family of computers:</p>

<p>-march=architecture-type Generate code for the specified
architecture. The choices for architecture-type are 1.0 for
PA 1.0, 1.1 for PA 1.1, and 2.0 for PA 2.0 processors. Refer
to /usr/lib/sched.models on an HP-UX system to determine the
proper architecture option for your machine. Code compiled
for lower numbered architectures will run on higher numbered
architectures, but not the other way around.</p>

<p>-mpa-risc-1-0 -mpa-risc-1-1 -mpa-risc-2-0 Synonyms for
-march=1.0, -march=1.1, and -march=2.0 respectively.</p>

<p>-mbig-switch Generate code suitable for big switch
tables. Use this option only if the assembler/linker
complain about out of range branches within a switch
table.</p>

<p>-mjump-in-delay Fill delay slots of function calls with
unconditional jump instructions by modifying the return
pointer for the function call to be the target of the
conditional jump.</p>

<p>-mdisable-fpregs Prevent floating point registers from
being used in any manner. This is necessary for compiling
kernels which perform lazy context switching of floating
point registers. If you use this option and attempt to
perform floating point operations, the compiler will
abort.</p>

<p>-mdisable-indexing Prevent the compiler from using
indexing address modes. This avoids some rather obscure
problems when compiling MIG generated code under MACH.</p>

<p>-mno-space-regs Generate code that assumes the target
has no space registers. This allows GCC to generate faster
indirect calls and use unscaled index address modes.</p>

<p>Such code is suitable for level 0 PA systems and
kernels.</p>

<p>-mfast-indirect-calls Generate code that assumes calls
never cross space boundaries. This allows GCC to emit code
which performs faster indirect calls.</p>

<p>This option will not work in the presence of shared
libraries or nested functions.</p>

<p>-mfixed-range=register-range Generate code treating the
given register range as fixed registers. A fixed register is
one that the register allocator can not use. This is useful
when compiling kernel code. A register range is specified as
two registers separated by a dash. Multiple register ranges
can be specified separated by a comma.</p>

<p>-mlong-load-store Generate 3-instruction load and store
sequences as sometimes required by the HP-UX 10 linker. This
is equivalent to the +k option to the HP compilers.</p>

<p>-mportable-runtime Use the portable calling conventions
proposed by HP for ELF systems.</p>

<p>-mgas Enable the use of assembler directives only GAS
understands.</p>

<p>-mschedule=cpu-type Schedule code according to the
constraints for the machine type cpu-type. The choices for
cpu-type are 700 7100, 7100LC, 7200, 7300 and 8000. Refer to
/usr/lib/sched.models on an HP-UX system to determine the
proper scheduling option for your machine. The default
scheduling is 8000.</p>

<p>-mlinker-opt Enable the optimization pass in the HP-UX
linker. Note this makes symbolic debugging impossible. It
also triggers a bug in the HP-UX 8 and HP-UX 9 linkers in
which they give bogus error messages when linking some
programs.</p>

<p>-msoft-float Generate output containing library calls
for floating point. Warning: the requisite libraries are not
available for all HPPA targets. Normally the facilities of
the machines usual C compiler are used, but this cannot be
done directly in cross-compilation. You must make your own
arrangements to provide suitable library functions for
cross-compilation.</p>

<p>-msoft-float changes the calling convention in the
output file; therefore, it is only useful if you compile all
of a program with this option. In particular, you need to
compile libgcc.a, the library that comes with GCC, with
-msoft-float in order for this to work.</p>

<p>-msio Generate the predefine, &quot;_SIO&quot;, for
server IO. The default is -mwsio. This generates the
predefines, &quot;__hp9000s700&quot;,
&quot;__hp9000s700__&quot; and &quot;_WSIO&quot;, for
workstation IO. These options are available under HP-UX and
HI-UX.</p>

<p>-mgnu-ld Use GNU ld specific options. This passes
-shared to ld when building a shared library. It is the
default when GCC is configured, explicitly or implicitly,
with the GNU linker. This option does not have any affect on
which ld is called, it only changes what parameters are
passed to that ld. The ld that is called is determined by
the --with-ld configure option, GCCs program search path,
and finally by the users PATH. The linker used by GCC can be
printed using which gcc -print-prog-name=l. This option is
only available on the 64 bit HP-UX GCC, i.e. configured with
hppa*64*-*-hpux*.</p>

<p>-mhp-ld Use HP ld specific options. This passes -b to ld
when building a shared library and passes +Accept
TypeMismatch to ld on all links. It is the default when GCC
is configured, explicitly or implicitly, with the HP linker.
This option does not have any affect on which ld is called,
it only changes what parameters are passed to that ld. The
ld that is called is determined by the --with-ld configure
option, GCCs program search path, and finally by the users
PATH. The linker used by GCC can be printed using whichgcc
-print-prog-name=ld. This option is only available on the 64
bit HP-UX GCC, i.e. configured with hppa*64*-*-hpux*.</p>

<p>-mlong-calls Generate code that uses long call
sequences. This ensures that a call is always able to reach
linker generated stubs. The default is to generate long
calls only when the distance from the call site to the
beginning of the function or translation unit, as the case
may be, exceeds a predefined limit set by the branch type
being used. The limits for normal calls are 7,600,000 and
240,000 bytes, respectively for the PA 2.0 and PA 1.X
architectures. Sibcalls are always limited at 240,000
bytes.</p>

<p>Distances are measured from the beginning of functions
when using the -ffunction-sections option, or when using the
-mgas and -mno-portable-runtime options together under HP-UX
with the SOM linker.</p>

<p>It is normally not desirable to use this option as it
will degrade performance. However, it may be useful in large
applications, particularly when partial linking is used to
build the application.</p>

<p>The types of long calls used depends on the capabilities
of the assembler and linker, and the type of code being
generated. The impact on systems that support long absolute
calls, and long pic symbol-difference or pc-relative calls
should be relatively small. However, an indirect call is
used on 32-bit ELF systems in pic code and it is quite
long.</p>

<p>-munix=unix-std Generate compiler predefines and select
a startfile for the specified UNIX standard. The choices for
unix-std are 93, 95 and 98. 93 is supported on all HP-UX
versions. 95 is available on HP- UX 10.10 and later. 98 is
available on HP-UX 11.11 and later. The default values are
93 for HP-UX 10.00, 95 for HP-UX 10.10 though to 11.00, and
98 for HP-UX 11.11 and later.</p>

<p>-munix=93 provides the same predefines as GCC 3.3 and
3.4. -munix=95 provides additional predefines for
&quot;XOPEN_UNIX&quot; and
&quot;_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED&quot;, and the startfile
unix95.o. -munix=98 provides additional predefines for
&quot;_XOPEN_UNIX&quot;, &quot;_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED&quot;,
&quot;_INCLUDE__STDC_A1_SOURCE&quot; and
&quot;_INCLUDE_XOPEN_SOURCE_500&quot;, and the startfile
unix98.o.</p>

<p>It is important to note that this option changes the
interfaces for various library routines. It also affects the
operational behavior of the C library. Thus, extreme care is
needed in using this option.</p>

<p>Library code that is intended to operate with more than
one UNIX standard must test, set and restore the variable
__xpg4_extended_mask as appropriate. Most GNU software
doesnt provide this capability.</p>

<p>-nolibdld Suppress the generation of link options to
search libdld.sl when the -static option is specified on
HP-UX 10 and later.</p>

<p>-static The HP-UX implementation of setlocale in libc
has a dependency on libdld.sl. There isn t an archive
version of libdld.sl. Thus, when the -static option is
specified, special link options are needed to resolve this
dependency.</p>

<p>On HP-UX 10 and later, the GCC driver adds the necessary
options to link with libdld.sl when the -static option is
specified. This causes the resulting binary to be dynamic.
On the 64-bit port, the linkers generate dynamic binaries by
default in any case. The -nolibdld option can be used to
prevent the GCC driver from adding these link options.</p>

<p>-threads Add support for multithreading with the dce
thread library under HP-UX. This option sets flags for both
the preprocessor and linker.</p>

<p>Intel 386 and AMD x86-64 Options These -m options are
defined for the i386 and x86-64 family of computers:</p>

<p>-mtune=cpu-type Tune to cpu-type everything applicable
about the generated code, except for the ABI and the set of
available instructions. The choices for cpu-type are:</p>

<p>generic Produce code optimized for the most common
IA32/AMD64/EM64T processors. If you know the CPU on which
your code will run, then you should use the corresponding
-mtune option instead of -mtune=generic. But, if you do not
know exactly what CPU users of your application will have,
then you should use this option.</p>

<p>As new processors are deployed in the marketplace, the
behavior of this option will change. Therefore, if you
upgrade to a newer version of GCC, the code generated option
will change to reflect the processors that were most common
when that version of GCC was released.</p>

<p>There is no -march=generic option because -march
indicates the instruction set the compiler can use, and
there is no generic instruction set applicable to all
processors. In contrast, -mtune indicates the processor (or,
in this case, collection of processors) for which the code
is optimized.</p>

<p>native This selects the CPU to tune for at compilation
time by determining the processor type of the compiling
machine. Using -mtune=native will produce code optimized for
the local machine under the constraints of the selected
instruction set. Using -march=native will enable all
instruction subsets supported by the local machine (hence
the result might not run on different machines).</p>

<p>c3-2 Via C3-2 CPU with MMX and SSE instruction set

<p>geode Embedded AMD CPU with MMX and 3dNOW! instruction
set support.</p>

<p>While picking a specific cpu-type will schedule things
appropriately for that particular chip, the compiler will
not generate any code that does not run on the i386 without
the -march=cpu-type option being used.</p>

<p>-march=cpu-type Generate instructions for the machine
type cpu-type. The choices for cpu-type are the same as for
-mtune. Moreover, specifying -march=cpu-type implies
-mtune=cpu-type.</p>

<p>-mcpu=cpu-type A deprecated synonym for -mtune.</p>

<p>-mfpmath=unit Generate floating point arithmetics for
selected unit unit. The choices for unit are:</p>

<p>387 Use the standard 387 floating point coprocessor
present majority of chips and emulated otherwise. Code
compiled with this option will run almost everywhere. The
temporary results are computed in 80bit precision instead of
precision specified by the type resulting in slightly
different results compared to most of other chips. See
-ffloat-store for more detailed description.</p>

<p>This is the default choice for i386 compiler.</p>

<p>sse Use scalar floating point instructions present in
the SSE instruction set. This instruction set is supported
by Pentium3 and newer chips, in the AMD line by Athlon-4,
Athlon-xp and Athlon-mp chips. The earlier version of SSE
instruction set supports only single precision arithmetics,
thus the double and extended precision arithmetics is still
done using 387. Later version, present only in Pentium4 and
the future AMD x86-64 chips supports double precision
arithmetics too.</p>

<p>For the i386 compiler, you need to use -march=cpu-type,
-msse or -msse2 switches to enable SSE extensions and make
this option effective. For the x86-64 compiler, these
extensions are enabled by default.</p>

<p>The resulting code should be considerably faster in the
majority of cases and avoid the numerical instability
problems of 387 code, but may break some existing code that
expects temporaries to be 80bit.</p>

<p>This is the default choice for the x86-64 compiler.</p>

<p>sse,387 sse+387 both Attempt to utilize both instruction
sets at once. This effectively double the amount of
available registers and on chips with separate execution
units for 387 and SSE the execution resources too. Use this
option with care, as it is still experimental, because the
GCC register allocator does not model separate functional
units well resulting in instable performance.</p>

<p>-masm=dialect Output asm instructions using selected
dialect. Supported choices are intel or att (the default
one). Darwin does not support intel.</p>

<p>-mieee-fp -mno-ieee-fp Control whether or not the
compiler uses IEEE floating point comparisons. These handle
correctly the case where the result of a comparison is
unordered.</p>

<p>-msoft-float Generate output containing library calls
for floating point. Warning: the requisite libraries are not
part of GCC. Normally the facilities of the machines usual C
compiler are used, but this cant be done directly in
cross-compilation. You must make your own arrangements to
provide suitable library functions for cross-
compilation.</p>

<p>On machines where a function returns floating point
results in the 80387 register stack, some floating point
opcodes may be emitted even if -msoft-float is used.</p>

<p>-mno-fp-ret-in-387 Do not use the FPU registers for
return values of functions.</p>

<p>The usual calling convention has functions return values
of types &quot;float&quot; and &quot;double&quot; in an FPU
register, even if there is no FPU. The idea is that the
operating system should emulate an FPU.</p>

<p>The option -mno-fp-ret-in-387 causes such values to be
returned in ordinary CPU registers instead.</p>

<p>-mno-fancy-math-387 Some 387 emulators do not support
the &quot;sin&quot;, &quot;cos&quot; and &quot;sqrt&quot;
instructions for the 387. Specify this option to avoid
generating those instructions. This option is the default on
FreeBSD, OpenBSD and NetBSD. This option is overridden when
-march indicates that the target cpu will always have an FPU
and so the instruction will not need emulation. As of
revision 2.6.1, these instructions are not generated unless
you also use the -funsafe-math-optimizations switch.</p>

<p>-malign-double -mno-align-double Control whether GCC
aligns &quot;double&quot;, &quot;long double&quot;, and
&quot;long long&quot; variables on a two word boundary or a
one word boundary. Aligning &quot;double&quot; variables on
a two word boundary will produce code that runs somewhat
faster on a Pentium at the expense of more memory.</p>

<p>On x86-64, -malign-double is enabled by default.</p>

<p>Warning: if you use the -malign-double switch,
structures containing the above types will be aligned
differently than the published application binary interface
specifications for the 386 and will not be binary compatible
with structures in code compiled without that switch.</p>

<p>-m96bit-long-double -m128bit-long-double These switches
control the size of &quot;long double&quot; type. The i386
application binary interface specifies the size to be 96
bits, so -m96bit-long-double is the default in 32 bit
mode.</p>

<p>Modern architectures (Pentium and newer) would prefer
&quot;long double&quot; to be aligned to an 8 or 16 byte
boundary. In arrays or structures conforming to the ABI,
this would not be possible. So specifying a
-m128bit-long-double will align &quot;long double&quot; to a
16 byte boundary by padding the &quot;long double&quot; with
an additional 32 bit zero.</p>

<p>In the x86-64 compiler, -m128bit-long-double is the
default choice as its ABI specifies that &quot;long
double&quot; is to be aligned on 16 byte boundary.</p>

<p>Notice that neither of these options enable any extra
precision over the x87 standard of 80 bits for a &quot;long
double&quot;.</p>

<p>Warning: if you override the default value for your
target ABI, the structures and arrays containing &quot;long
double&quot; variables will change their size as well as
function calling convention for function taking &quot;long
double&quot; will be modified. Hence they will not be binary
compatible with arrays or structures in code compiled
without that switch.</p>

<p>-mlarge-data-threshold=number When -mcmodel=medium is
specified, the data greater than threshold are placed in
large data section. This value must be the same across all
object linked into the binary and defaults to 65535.</p>

<p>-mrtd Use a different function-calling convention, in
which functions that take a fixed number of arguments return
with the &quot;ret&quot; num instruction, which pops their
arguments while returning. This saves one instruction in the
caller since there is no need to pop the arguments
there.</p>

<p>You can specify that an individual function is called
with this calling sequence with the function attribute
stdcall. You can also override the -mrtd option by using the
function attribute cdecl.</p>

<p>Warning: this calling convention is incompatible with
the one normally used on Unix, so you cannot use it if you
need to call libraries compiled with the Unix compiler.</p>

<p>Also, you must provide function prototypes for all
functions that take variable numbers of arguments (including
&quot;printf&quot;); otherwise incorrect code will be
generated for calls to those functions.</p>

<p>In addition, seriously incorrect code will result if you
call a function with too many arguments. (Normally, extra
arguments are harmlessly ignored.)</p>

<p>-mregparm=num Control how many registers are used to
pass integer arguments. By default, no registers are used to
pass arguments, and at most 3 registers can be used. You can
control this behavior for a specific function by using the
function attribute regparm.</p>

<p>Warning: if you use this switch, and num is nonzero,
then you must build all modules with the same value,
including any libraries. This includes the system libraries
and startup modules.</p>

<p>-msseregparm Use SSE register passing conventions for
float and double arguments and return values. You can
control this behavior for a specific function by using the
function attribute sseregparm.</p>

<p>Warning: if you use this switch then you must build all
modules with the same value, including any libraries. This
includes the system libraries and startup modules.</p>

<p>-mpc32 -mpc64 -mpc80 Set 80387 floating-point precision
to 32, 64 or 80 bits. When -mpc32 is specified, the
significands of results of floating-point operations are
rounded to 24 bits (single precision); -mpc64 rounds the
significands of results of floating-point operations to 53
bits (double precision) and -mpc80 rounds the significands
of results of floating-point operations to 64 bits (extended
double precision), which is the default. When this option is
used, floating-point operations in higher precisions are not
available to the programmer without setting the FPU control
word explicitly.</p>

<p>Setting the rounding of floating-point operations to
less than the default 80 bits can speed some programs by 2%
or more. Note that some mathematical libraries assume that
extended precision (80 bit) floating-point operations are
enabled by default; routines in such libraries could suffer
significant loss of accuracy, typically through so-called
&quot;catastrophic cancellation&quot;, when this option is
used to set the precision to less than extended
precision.</p>

<p>-mstackrealign Realign the stack at entry. On the Intel
x86, the -mstackrealign option will generate an alternate
prologue and epilogue that realigns the runtime stack if
necessary. This supports mixing legacy codes that keep a
4-byte aligned stack with modern codes that keep a 16-byte
stack for SSE compatibility. See also the attribute
&quot;force_align_arg_pointer&quot;, applicable to
individual functions.</p>

<p>-mpreferred-stack-boundary=num Attempt to keep the stack
boundary aligned to a 2 raised to num byte boundary. If
-mpreferred-stack-boundary is not specified, the default is
4 (16 bytes or 128 bits).</p>

<p>-mincoming-stack-boundary=num Assume the incoming stack
is aligned to a 2 raised to num byte boundary. If
-mincoming-stack-boundary is not specified, the one
specified by -mpreferred-stack-boundary will be used.</p>

<p>On Pentium and PentiumPro, &quot;double&quot; and
&quot;long double&quot; values should be aligned to an 8
byte boundary (see -malign-double) or suffer significant run
time performance penalties. On Pentium III, the Streaming
SIMD Extension (SSE) data type &quot;__m128&quot; may not
work properly if it is not 16 byte aligned.</p>

<p>To ensure proper alignment of this values on the stack,
the stack boundary must be as aligned as that required by
any value stored on the stack. Further, every function must
be generated such that it keeps the stack aligned. Thus
calling a function compiled with a higher preferred stack
boundary from a function compiled with a lower preferred
stack boundary will most likely misalign the stack. It is
recommended that libraries that use callbacks always use the
default setting.</p>

<p>This extra alignment does consume extra stack space, and
generally increases code size. Code that is sensitive to
stack space usage, such as embedded systems and operating
system kernels, may want to reduce the preferred alignment
to -mpreferred-stack-boundary=2.</p>

<p>-mmmx -mno-mmx -msse -mno-sse -msse2 -mno-sse2 -msse3
-mno-sse3 -mssse3 -mno-ssse3 -msse4.1 -mno-sse4.1 -msse4.2
-mno-sse4.2 -msse4 -mno-sse4 -mavx -mno-avx -maes -mno-aes
-mpclmul -mno-pclmul -msse4a -mno-sse4a -mfma4 -mno-fma4
-mxop -mno-xop -mlwp -mno-lwp -m3dnow -mno-3dnow -mpopcnt
-mno-popcnt -mabm -mno-abm These switches enable or disable
the use of instructions in the MMX, SSE, SSE2, SSE3, SSSE3,
SSE4.1, AVX, AES, PCLMUL, SSE4A, FMA4, XOP, LWP, ABM or
3DNow! extended instruction sets. These extensions are also
available as built-in functions: see X86 Built- in
Functions, for details of the functions enabled and disabled
by these switches.</p>

<p>To have SSE/SSE2 instructions generated automatically
from floating-point code (as opposed to 387 instructions),
see -mfpmath=sse.</p>

<p>GCC depresses SSEx instructions when -mavx is used.
Instead, it generates new AVX instructions or AVX
equivalence for all SSEx instructions when needed.</p>

<p>These options will enable GCC to use these extended
instructions in generated code, even without -mfpmath=sse.
Applications which perform runtime CPU detection must
compile separate files for each supported architecture,
using the appropriate flags. In particular, the file
containing the CPU detection code should be compiled without
these options.</p>

<p>-mfused-madd -mno-fused-madd Do (don t) generate code
that uses the fused multiply/add or multiply/subtract
instructions. The default is to use these instructions.</p>

<p>-mcld This option instructs GCC to emit a
&quot;cld&quot; instruction in the prologue of functions
that use string instructions. String instructions depend on
the DF flag to select between autoincrement or autodecrement
mode. While the ABI specifies the DF flag to be cleared on
function entry, some operating systems violate this
specification by not clearing the DF flag in their exception
dispatchers. The exception handler can be invoked with the
DF flag set which leads to wrong direction mode, when string
instructions are used. This option can be enabled by default
on 32-bit x86 targets by configuring GCC with the
--enable-cld configure option. Generation of &quot;cld&quot;
instructions can be suppressed with the -mno-cld compiler
option in this case.</p>

<p>-mcx16 This option will enable GCC to use CMPXCHG16B
instruction in generated code. CMPXCHG16B allows for atomic
operations on 128-bit double quadword (or oword) data types.
This is useful for high resolution counters that could be
updated by multiple processors (or cores). This instruction
is generated as part of atomic built- in functions: see
Atomic Builtins for details.</p>

<p>-msahf This option will enable GCC to use SAHF
instruction in generated 64-bit code. Early Intel CPUs with
Intel 64 lacked LAHF and SAHF instructions supported by
AMD64 until introduction of Pentium 4 G1 step in December
2005. LAHF and SAHF are load and store instructions,
respectively, for certain status flags. In 64-bit mode, SAHF
instruction is used to optimize &quot;fmod&quot;,
&quot;drem&quot; or &quot;remainder&quot; built-in
functions: see Other Builtins for details.</p>

<p>-mmovbe This option will enable GCC to use movbe
instruction to implement &quot;__builtin_bswap32&quot; and
&quot;__builtin_bswap64&quot;.</p>

<p>-mcrc32 This option will enable built-in functions,
&quot;__builtin_ia32_crc32qi&quot;,
&quot;__builtin_ia32_crc32hi&quot;.
&quot;__builtin_ia32_crc32si&quot; and
&quot;__builtin_ia32_crc32di&quot; to generate the crc32
machine instruction.</p>

<p>-mrecip This option will enable GCC to use RCPSS and
RSQRTSS instructions (and their vectorized variants RCPPS
and RSQRTPS) with an additional Newton-Raphson step to
increase precision instead of DIVSS and SQRTSS (and their
vectorized variants) for single precision floating point
arguments. These instructions are generated only when
-funsafe-math-optimizations is enabled together with
-finite-math-only and -fno-trapping-math. Note that while
the throughput of the sequence is higher than the throughput
of the non-reciprocal instruction, the precision of the
sequence can be decreased by up to 2 ulp (i.e. the inverse
of 1.0 equals 0.99999994).</p>

<p>-mveclibabi=type Specifies the ABI type to use for
vectorizing intrinsics using an external library. Supported
types are &quot;svml&quot; for the Intel short vector math
library and &quot;acml&quot; for the AMD math core library
style of interfacing. GCC will currently emit calls to
&quot;vmldExp2&quot;, &quot;vmldLn2&quot;,
&quot;vmldLog102&quot;, &quot;vmldLog102&quot;,
&quot;vmldPow2&quot;, &quot;vmldTanh2&quot;,
&quot;vmldTan2&quot;, &quot;vmldAtan2&quot;,
&quot;vmldAtanh2&quot;, &quot;vmldCbrt2&quot;,
&quot;vmldSinh2&quot;, &quot;vmldSin2&quot;,
&quot;vmldAsinh2&quot;, &quot;vmldAsin2&quot;,
&quot;vmldCosh2&quot;, &quot;vmldCos2&quot;,
&quot;vmldAcosh2&quot;, &quot;vmldAcos2&quot;,
&quot;vmlsExp4&quot;, &quot;vmlsLn4&quot;,
&quot;vmlsLog104&quot;, &quot;vmlsLog104&quot;,
&quot;vmlsPow4&quot;, &quot;vmlsTanh4&quot;,
&quot;vmlsTan4&quot;, &quot;vmlsAtan4&quot;,
&quot;vmlsAtanh4&quot;, &quot;vmlsCbrt4&quot;,
&quot;vmlsSinh4&quot;, &quot;vmlsSin4&quot;,
&quot;vmlsAsinh4&quot;, &quot;vmlsAsin4&quot;,
&quot;vmlsCosh4&quot;, &quot;vmlsCos4&quot;,
&quot;vmlsAcosh4&quot; and &quot;vmlsAcos4&quot; for
corresponding function type when -mveclibabi=svml is used
and &quot;__vrd2_sin&quot;, &quot;__vrd2_cos&quot;,
&quot;__vrd2_exp&quot;, &quot;__vrd2_log&quot;,
&quot;__vrd2_log2&quot;, &quot;__vrd2_log10&quot;,
&quot;__vrs4_sinf&quot;, &quot;__vrs4_cosf&quot;,
&quot;__vrs4_expf&quot;, &quot;__vrs4_logf&quot;,
&quot;__vrs4_log2f&quot;, &quot;__vrs4_log10f&quot; and
&quot;__vrs4_powf&quot; for corresponding function type when
-mveclibabi=acml is used. Both -ftree-vectorize and
-funsafe-math-optimizations have to be enabled. A SVML or
ACML ABI compatible library will have to be specified at
link time.</p>

<p>-mpush-args -mno-push-args Use PUSH operations to store
outgoing parameters. This method is shorter and usually
equally fast as method using SUB/MOV operations and is
enabled by default. In some cases disabling it may improve
performance because of improved scheduling and reduced
dependencies.</p>

<p>-maccumulate-outgoing-args If enabled, the maximum
amount of space required for outgoing arguments will be
computed in the function prologue. This is faster on most
modern CPUs because of reduced dependencies, improved
scheduling and reduced stack usage when preferred stack
boundary is not equal to 2. The drawback is a notable
increase in code size. This switch implies
-mno-push-args.</p>

<p>-mthreads Support thread-safe exception handling on
Mingw32. Code that relies on thread-safe exception handling
must compile and link all code with the -mthreads option.
When compiling, -mthreads defines -D_MT; when linking, it
links in a special thread helper library -lmingwthrd which
cleans up per thread exception handling data.</p>

<p>-mno-align-stringops Do not align destination of inlined
string operations. This switch reduces code size and
improves performance in case the destination is already
aligned, but GCC doesnt know about it.</p>

<p>-minline-all-stringops By default GCC inlines string
operations only when destination is known to be aligned at
least to 4 byte boundary. This enables more inlining,
increase code size, but may improve performance of code that
depends on fast memcpy, strlen and memset for short
lengths.</p>

<p>-minline-stringops-dynamically For string operation of
unknown size, inline runtime checks so for small blocks
inline code is used, while for large blocks library call is
used.</p>

<p>-mstringop-strategy=alg Overwrite internal decision
heuristic about particular algorithm to inline string
operation with. The allowed values are &quot;rep_byte&quot;,
&quot;rep_4byte&quot;, &quot;rep_8byte&quot; for expanding
using i386 &quot;rep&quot; prefix of specified size,
&quot;byte_loop&quot;, &quot;loop&quot;,
&quot;unrolled_loop&quot; for expanding inline loop,
&quot;libcall&quot; for always expanding library call.</p>

<p>-momit-leaf-frame-pointer Don t keep the frame pointer
in a register for leaf functions. This avoids the
instructions to save, set up and restore frame pointers and
makes an extra register available in leaf functions. The
option -fomit-frame-pointer removes the frame pointer for
all functions which might make debugging harder.</p>

<p>-mtls-direct-seg-refs -mno-tls-direct-seg-refs Controls
whether TLS variables may be accessed with offsets from the
TLS segment register (%gs for 32-bit, %fs for 64-bit), or
whether the thread base pointer must be added. Whether or
not this is legal depends on the operating system, and
whether it maps the segment to cover the entire TLS
area.</p>

<p>For systems that use GNU libc, the default is on.</p>

<p>-msse2avx -mno-sse2avx Specify that the assembler should
encode SSE instructions with VEX prefix. The option -mavx
turns this on by default.</p>

<p>These -m switches are supported in addition to the above
on AMD x86-64 processors in 64-bit environments.</p>

<p>-m32 -m64 Generate code for a 32-bit or 64-bit
environment. The 32-bit environment sets int, long and
pointer to 32 bits and generates code that runs on any i386
system. The 64-bit environment sets int to 32 bits and long
and pointer to 64 bits and generates code for AMD s x86-64
architecture. For darwin only the -m64 option turns off the
-fno-pic and -mdynamic-no-pic options.</p>

<p>-mno-red-zone Do not use a so called red zone for x86-64
code. The red zone is mandated by the x86-64 ABI, it is a
128-byte area beyond the location of the stack pointer that
will not be modified by signal or interrupt handlers and
therefore can be used for temporary data without adjusting
the stack pointer. The flag -mno-red-zone disables this red
zone.</p>

<p>-mcmodel=small Generate code for the small code model:
the program and its symbols must be linked in the lower 2 GB
of the address space. Pointers are 64 bits. Programs can be
statically or dynamically linked. This is the default code
model.</p>

<p>-mcmodel=kernel Generate code for the kernel code model.
The kernel runs in the negative 2 GB of the address space.
This model has to be used for Linux kernel code.</p>

<p>-mcmodel=medium Generate code for the medium model: The
program is linked in the lower 2 GB of the address space.
Small symbols are also placed there. Symbols with sizes
larger than -mlarge-data-threshold are put into large data
or bss sections and can be located above 2GB. Programs can
be statically or dynamically linked.</p>

<p>-mcmodel=large Generate code for the large model: This
model makes no assumptions about addresses and sizes of
sections.</p>

<p>IA-64 Options These are the -m options defined for the
Intel IA-64 architecture.</p>

<p>-mbig-endian Generate code for a big endian target. This
is the default for HP- UX.</p>

<p>-mlittle-endian Generate code for a little endian
target. This is the default for AIX5 and GNU/Linux.</p>

<p>-mgnu-as -mno-gnu-as Generate (or dont) code for the GNU
assembler. This is the default.</p>

<p>-mgnu-ld -mno-gnu-ld Generate (or dont) code for the GNU
linker. This is the default.</p>

<p>-mno-pic Generate code that does not use a global
pointer register. The result is not position independent
code, and violates the IA-64 ABI.</p>

<p>-mvolatile-asm-stop -mno-volatile-asm-stop Generate (or
dont) a stop bit immediately before and after volatile asm
statements.</p>

<p>-mregister-names -mno-register-names Generate (or dont)
in, loc, and out register names for the stacked registers.
This may make assembler output more readable.</p>

<p>-mno-sdata -msdata Disable (or enable) optimizations
that use the small data section. This may be useful for
working around optimizer bugs.</p>

<p>-mconstant-gp Generate code that uses a single constant
global pointer value. This is useful when compiling kernel
code.</p>

<p>-mauto-pic Generate code that is self-relocatable. This
implies -mconstant-gp. This is useful when compiling
firmware code.</p>

<p>-minline-float-divide-min-latency Generate code for
inline divides of floating point values using the minimum
latency algorithm.</p>

<p>-minline-float-divide-max-throughput Generate code for
inline divides of floating point values using the maximum
throughput algorithm.</p>

<p>-minline-int-divide-min-latency Generate code for inline
divides of integer values using the minimum latency
algorithm.</p>

<p>-minline-int-divide-max-throughput Generate code for
inline divides of integer values using the maximum
throughput algorithm.</p>

<p>-minline-sqrt-min-latency Generate code for inline
square roots using the minimum latency algorithm.</p>

<p>-minline-sqrt-max-throughput Generate code for inline
square roots using the maximum throughput algorithm.</p>

<p>-mno-dwarf2-asm -mdwarf2-asm Don t (or do) generate
assembler code for the DWARF2 line number debugging info.
This may be useful when not using the GNU assembler.</p>

<p>-mearly-stop-bits -mno-early-stop-bits Allow stop bits
to be placed earlier than immediately preceding the
instruction that triggered the stop bit. This can improve
instruction scheduling, but does not always do so.</p>

<p>-mfixed-range=register-range Generate code treating the
given register range as fixed registers. A fixed register is
one that the register allocator can not use. This is useful
when compiling kernel code. A register range is specified as
two registers separated by a dash. Multiple register ranges
can be specified separated by a comma.</p>

<p>-mtls-size=tls-size Specify bit size of immediate TLS
offsets. Valid values are 14, 22, and 64.</p>

<p>-mtune=cpu-type Tune the instruction scheduling for a
particular CPU, Valid values are itanium, itanium1, merced,
itanium2, and mckinley.</p>

<p>-mt -pthread Add support for multithreading using the
POSIX threads library. This option sets flags for both the
preprocessor and linker. It does not affect the thread
safety of object code produced by the compiler or that of
libraries supplied with it. These are HP-UX specific
flags.</p>

<p>-milp32 -mlp64 Generate code for a 32-bit or 64-bit
environment. The 32-bit environment sets int, long and
pointer to 32 bits. The 64-bit environment sets int to 32
bits and long and pointer to 64 bits. These are HP-UX
specific flags.</p>

<p>-mno-sched-br-data-spec -msched-br-data-spec
(Dis/En)able data speculative scheduling before reload. This
will result in generation of the ld.a instructions and the
corresponding check instructions (ld.c / chk.a). The default
is disable.</p>

<p>-msched-ar-data-spec -mno-sched-ar-data-spec
(En/Dis)able data speculative scheduling after reload. This
will result in generation of the ld.a instructions and the
corresponding check instructions (ld.c / chk.a). The default
is enable.</p>

<p>-mno-sched-control-spec -msched-control-spec
(Dis/En)able control speculative scheduling. This feature is
available only during region scheduling (i.e. before
reload). This will result in generation of the ld.s
instructions and the corresponding check instructions chk.s
. The default is disable.</p>

<p>-msched-br-in-data-spec -mno-sched-br-in-data-spec
(En/Dis)able speculative scheduling of the instructions that
are dependent on the data speculative loads before reload.
This is effective only with -msched-br-data-spec enabled.
The default is enable.</p>

<p>-msched-ar-in-data-spec -mno-sched-ar-in-data-spec
(En/Dis)able speculative scheduling of the instructions that
are dependent on the data speculative loads after reload.
This is effective only with -msched-ar-data-spec enabled.
The default is enable.</p>

<p>-msched-in-control-spec -mno-sched-in-control-spec
(En/Dis)able speculative scheduling of the instructions that
are dependent on the control speculative loads. This is
effective only with -msched-control-spec enabled. The
default is enable.</p>

<p>-msched-ldc -mno-sched-ldc (En/Dis)able use of simple
data speculation checks ld.c . If disabled, only chk.a
instructions will be emitted to check data speculative
loads. The default is enable.</p>

<p>-mno-sched-control-ldc -msched-control-ldc (Dis/En)able
use of ld.c instructions to check control speculative loads.
If enabled, in case of control speculative load with no
speculatively scheduled dependent instructions this load
will be emitted as ld.sa and ld.c will be used to check it.
The default is disable.</p>

<p>-mno-sched-spec-verbose -msched-spec-verbose
(Dis/En)able printing of the information about speculative
motions.</p>

<p>-mno-sched-prefer-non-data-spec-insns
-msched-prefer-non-data-spec-insns If enabled, data
speculative instructions will be chosen for schedule only if
there are no other choices at the moment. This will make the
use of the data speculation much more conservative. The
default is disable.</p>

<p>-mno-sched-prefer-non-control-spec-insns
-msched-prefer-non-control-spec-insns If enabled, control
speculative instructions will be chosen for schedule only if
there are no other choices at the moment. This will make the
use of the control speculation much more conservative. The
default is disable.</p>

<p>-mno-sched-count-spec-in-critical-path
-msched-count-spec-in-critical-path If enabled, speculative
dependencies will be considered during computation of the
instructions priorities. This will make the use of the
speculation a bit more conservative. The default is
disable.</p>

<p>M32C Options -mcpu=name Select the CPU for which code is
generated. name may be one of r8c for the R8C/Tiny series,
m16c for the M16C (up to /60) series, m32cm for the M16C/80
series, or m32c for the M32C/80 series.</p>

<p>-msim Specifies that the program will be run on the
simulator. This causes an alternate runtime library to be
linked in which supports, for example, file I/O. You must
not use this option when generating programs that will run
on real hardware; you must provide your own runtime library
for whatever I/O functions are needed.</p>

<p>-memregs=number Specifies the number of memory-based
pseudo-registers GCC will use during code generation. These
pseudo-registers will be used like real registers, so there
is a tradeoff between GCC s ability to fit the code into
available registers, and the performance penalty of using
memory instead of registers. Note that all modules in a
program must be compiled with the same value for this
option. Because of that, you must not use this option with
the default runtime libraries gcc builds.</p>

<p>M32R/D Options These -m options are defined for Renesas
M32R/D architectures:</p>

<p>-m32r2 Generate code for the M32R/2.</p>

<p>-m32rx Generate code for the M32R/X.</p>

<p>-m32r Generate code for the M32R. This is the
default.</p>

<p>-mmodel=small Assume all objects live in the lower 16MB
of memory (so that their addresses can be loaded with the
&quot;ld24&quot; instruction), and assume all subroutines
are reachable with the &quot;bl&quot; instruction. This is
the default.</p>

<p>The addressability of a particular object can be set
with the &quot;model&quot; attribute.</p>

<p>-mmodel=medium Assume objects may be anywhere in the
32-bit address space (the compiler will generate
&quot;seth/add3&quot; instructions to load their addresses),
and assume all subroutines are reachable with the
&quot;bl&quot; instruction.</p>

<p>-mmodel=large Assume objects may be anywhere in the
32-bit address space (the compiler will generate
&quot;seth/add3&quot; instructions to load their addresses),
and assume subroutines may not be reachable with the
&quot;bl&quot; instruction (the compiler will generate the
much slower &quot;seth/add3/jl&quot; instruction
sequence).</p>

<p>-msdata=none Disable use of the small data area.
Variables will be put into one of .data, bss, or .rodata
(unless the &quot;section&quot; attribute has been
specified). This is the default.</p>

<p>The small data area consists of sections .sdata and
.sbss. Objects may be explicitly put in the small data area
with the &quot;section&quot; attribute using one of these
sections.</p>

<p>-msdata=sdata Put small global and static data in the
small data area, but do not generate special code to
reference them.</p>

<p>-msdata=use Put small global and static data in the
small data area, and generate special instructions to
reference them.</p>

<p>-G num Put global and static objects less than or equal
to num bytes into the small data or bss sections instead of
the normal data or bss sections. The default value of num is
8. The -msdata option must be set to one of sdata or use for
this option to have any effect.</p>

<p>All modules should be compiled with the same -G num
value. Compiling with different values of num may or may not
work; if it doesn t the linker will give an error
message---incorrect code will not be generated.</p>

<p>-mdebug Makes the M32R specific code in the compiler
display some statistics that might help in debugging
programs.</p>

<p>-malign-loops Align all loops to a 32-byte boundary.</p>

<p>-mno-align-loops Do not enforce a 32-byte alignment for
loops. This is the default.</p>

<p>-missue-rate=number Issue number instructions per cycle.
number can only be 1 or 2.</p>

<p>-mbranch-cost=number number can only be 1 or 2. If it is
1 then branches will be preferred over conditional code, if
it is 2, then the opposite will apply.</p>

<p>-mflush-trap=number Specifies the trap number to use to
flush the cache. The default is 12. Valid numbers are
between 0 and 15 inclusive.</p>

<p>-mno-flush-trap Specifies that the cache cannot be
flushed by using a trap.</p>

<p>-mflush-func=name Specifies the name of the operating
system function to call to flush the cache. The default is
_flush_cache, but a function call will only be used if a
trap is not available.</p>

<p>-mno-flush-func Indicates that there is no OS function
for flushing the cache.</p>

<p>M680x0 Options These are the -m options defined for
M680x0 and ColdFire processors. The default settings depend
on which architecture was selected when the compiler was
configured; the defaults for the most common choices are
given below.</p>

<p>-march=arch Generate code for a specific M680x0 or
ColdFire instruction set architecture. Permissible values of
arch for M680x0 architectures are: 68000, 68010, 68020,
68030, 68040, 68060 and cpu32. ColdFire architectures are
selected according to Freescales ISA classification and the
permissible values are: isaa, isaaplus, isab and isac.</p>

<p>gcc defines a macro __mcfarch__ whenever it is
generating code for a ColdFire target. The arch in this
macro is one of the -march arguments given above.</p>

<p>When used together, -march and -mtune select code that
runs on a family of similar processors but that is optimized
for a particular microarchitecture.</p>

<p>-mcpu=cpu Generate code for a specific M680x0 or
ColdFire processor. The M680x0 cpus are: 68000, 68010,
68020, 68030, 68040, 68060, 68302, 68332 and cpu32. The
ColdFire cpus are given by the table below, which also
classifies the CPUs into families:</p>

<p>Family : -mcpu arguments 51qe : 51qe 5206 : 5202 5204
5206 5206e : 5206e 5208 : 5207 5208 5211a : 5210a 5211a 5213
: 5211 5212 5213 5216 : 5214 5216 52235 : 52230 52231 52232
52233 52234 52235 5225 : 5224 5225 5235 : 5232 5233 5234
5235 523x 5249 : 5249 5250 : 5250 5271 : 5270 5271 5272 :
5272 5275 : 5274 5275 5282 : 5280 5281 5282 528x 5307 : 5307
5329 : 5327 5328 5329 532x 5373 : 5372 5373 537x 5407 : 5407
5475 : 5470 5471 5472 5473 5474 5475 547x 5480 5481 5482
5483 5484 5485</p>

<p>-mcpu=cpu overrides -march=arch if arch is compatible
with cpu. Other combinations of -mcpu and -march are
rejected.</p>

<p>gcc defines the macro __mcf_cpu_cpu when ColdFire target
cpu is selected. It also defines __mcf_family_family, where
the value of family is given by the table above.</p>

<p>-mtune=tune Tune the code for a particular
microarchitecture, within the constraints set by -march and
-mcpu. The M680x0 microarchitectures are: 68000, 68010,
68020, 68030, 68040, 68060 and cpu32. The ColdFire
microarchitectures are: cfv1, cfv2, cfv3, cfv4 and
cfv4e.</p>

<p>You can also use -mtune=68020-40 for code that needs to
run relatively well on 68020, 68030 and 68040 targets.
-mtune=68020-60 is similar but includes 68060 targets as
well. These two options select the same tuning decisions as
-m68020-40 and -m68020-60 respectively.</p>

<p>gcc defines the macros __mcarch and __mcarch__ when
tuning for 680x0 architecture arch. It also defines mcarch
unless either -ansi or a non-GNU -std option is used. If gcc
is tuning for a range of architectures, as selected by
-mtune=68020-40 or -mtune=68020-60, it defines the macros
for every architecture in the range.</p>

<p>gcc also defines the macro __muarch__ when tuning for
ColdFire microarchitecture uarch, where uarch is one of the
arguments given above.</p>

<p>-m68000 -mc68000 Generate output for a 68000. This is
the default when the compiler is configured for 68000-based
systems. It is equivalent to -march=68000.</p>

<p>Use this option for microcontrollers with a 68000 or
EC000 core, including the 68008, 68302, 68306, 68307, 68322,
68328 and 68356.</p>

<p>-m68010 Generate output for a 68010. This is the default
when the compiler is configured for 68010-based systems. It
is equivalent to -march=68010.</p>

<p>-m68020 -mc68020 Generate output for a 68020. This is
the default when the compiler is configured for 68020-based
systems. It is equivalent to -march=68020.</p>

<p>-m68030 Generate output for a 68030. This is the default
when the compiler is configured for 68030-based systems. It
is equivalent to -march=68030.</p>

<p>-m68040 Generate output for a 68040. This is the default
when the compiler is configured for 68040-based systems. It
is equivalent to -march=68040.</p>

<p>This option inhibits the use of 68881/68882 instructions
that have to be emulated by software on the 68040. Use this
option if your 68040 does not have code to emulate those
instructions.</p>

<p>-m68060 Generate output for a 68060. This is the default
when the compiler is configured for 68060-based systems. It
is equivalent to -march=68060.</p>

<p>This option inhibits the use of 68020 and 68881/68882
instructions that have to be emulated by software on the
68060. Use this option if your 68060 does not have code to
emulate those instructions.</p>

<p>-mcpu32 Generate output for a CPU32. This is the default
when the compiler is configured for CPU32-based systems. It
is equivalent to -march=cpu32.</p>

<p>Use this option for microcontrollers with a CPU32 or
CPU32+ core, including the 68330, 68331, 68332, 68333,
68334, 68336, 68340, 68341, 68349 and 68360.</p>

<p>-m5200 Generate output for a 520X ColdFire CPU. This is
the default when the compiler is configured for 520X-based
systems. It is equivalent to -mcpu=5206, and is now
deprecated in favor of that option.</p>

<p>Use this option for microcontroller with a 5200 core,
including the MCF5202, MCF5203, MCF5204 and MCF5206.</p>

<p>-m5206e Generate output for a 5206e ColdFire CPU. The
option is now deprecated in favor of the equivalent
-mcpu=5206e.</p>

<p>-m528x Generate output for a member of the ColdFire 528X
family. The option is now deprecated in favor of the
equivalent -mcpu=528x.</p>

<p>-m5307 Generate output for a ColdFire 5307 CPU. The
option is now deprecated in favor of the equivalent
-mcpu=5307.</p>

<p>-m5407 Generate output for a ColdFire 5407 CPU. The
option is now deprecated in favor of the equivalent
-mcpu=5407.</p>

<p>-mcfv4e Generate output for a ColdFire V4e family CPU
(e.g. 547x/548x). This includes use of hardware floating
point instructions. The option is equivalent to -mcpu=547x,
and is now deprecated in favor of that option.</p>

<p>-m68020-40 Generate output for a 68040, without using
any of the new instructions. This results in code which can
run relatively efficiently on either a 68020/68881 or a
68030 or a 68040. The generated code does use the 68881
instructions that are emulated on the 68040.</p>

<p>The option is equivalent to -march=68020
-mtune=68020-40.</p>

<p>-m68020-60 Generate output for a 68060, without using
any of the new instructions. This results in code which can
run relatively efficiently on either a 68020/68881 or a
68030 or a 68040. The generated code does use the 68881
instructions that are emulated on the 68060.</p>

<p>The option is equivalent to -march=68020
-mtune=68020-60.</p>

<p>-mhard-float -m68881 Generate floating-point
instructions. This is the default for 68020 and above, and
for ColdFire devices that have an FPU. It defines the macro
__HAVE_68881__ on M680x0 targets and __mcffpu__ on ColdFire
targets.</p>

<p>-msoft-float Do not generate floating-point
instructions; use library calls instead. This is the default
for 68000, 68010, and 68832 targets. It is also the default
for ColdFire devices that have no FPU.</p>

<p>-mdiv -mno-div Generate (do not generate) ColdFire
hardware divide and remainder instructions. If -march is
used without -mcpu, the default is &quot;on&quot; for
ColdFire architectures and &quot;off&quot; for M680x0
architectures. Otherwise, the default is taken from the
target CPU (either the default CPU, or the one specified by
-mcpu). For example, the default is &quot;off&quot; for
-mcpu=5206 and &quot;on&quot; for -mcpu=5206e.</p>

<p>gcc defines the macro __mcfhwdiv__ when this option is
enabled.</p>

<p>-mshort Consider type &quot;int&quot; to be 16 bits
wide, like &quot;short int&quot;. Additionally, parameters
passed on the stack are also aligned to a 16-bit boundary
even on targets whose API mandates promotion to 32-bit.</p>

<p>-mno-short Do not consider type &quot;int&quot; to be 16
bits wide. This is the default.</p>

<p>-mnobitfield -mno-bitfield Do not use the bit-field
instructions. The -m68000, -mcpu32 and -m5200 options imply
-mnobitfield.</p>

<p>-mbitfield Do use the bit-field instructions. The
-m68020 option implies -mbitfield. This is the default if
you use a configuration designed for a 68020.</p>

<p>-mrtd Use a different function-calling convention, in
which functions that take a fixed number of arguments return
with the &quot;rtd&quot; instruction, which pops their
arguments while returning. This saves one instruction in the
caller since there is no need to pop the arguments
there.</p>

<p>This calling convention is incompatible with the one
normally used on Unix, so you cannot use it if you need to
call libraries compiled with the Unix compiler.</p>

<p>Also, you must provide function prototypes for all
functions that take variable numbers of arguments (including
&quot;printf&quot;); otherwise incorrect code will be
generated for calls to those functions.</p>

<p>In addition, seriously incorrect code will result if you
call a function with too many arguments. (Normally, extra
arguments are harmlessly ignored.)</p>

<p>The &quot;rtd&quot; instruction is supported by the
68010, 68020, 68030, 68040, 68060 and CPU32 processors, but
not by the 68000 or 5200.</p>

<p>-mno-rtd Do not use the calling conventions selected by
-mrtd. This is the default.</p>

<p>-malign-int -mno-align-int Control whether GCC aligns
&quot;int&quot;, &quot;long&quot;, &quot;long long&quot;,
&quot;float&quot;, &quot;double&quot;, and &quot;long
double&quot; variables on a 32-bit boundary (-malign-int) or
a 16-bit boundary (-mno-align-int). Aligning variables on
32-bit boundaries produces code that runs somewhat faster on
processors with 32-bit busses at the expense of more
memory.</p>

<p>Warning: if you use the -malign-int switch, GCC will
align structures containing the above types differently than
most published application binary interface specifications
for the m68k.</p>

<p>-mpcrel Use the pc-relative addressing mode of the 68000
directly, instead of using a global offset table. At
present, this option implies -fpic, allowing at most a
16-bit offset for pc-relative addressing. -fPIC is not
presently supported with -mpcrel, though this could be
supported for 68020 and higher processors.</p>

<p>-mno-strict-align -mstrict-align Do not (do) assume that
unaligned memory references will be handled by the
system.</p>

<p>-msep-data Generate code that allows the data segment to
be located in a different area of memory from the text
segment. This allows for execute in place in an environment
without virtual memory management. This option implies
-fPIC.</p>

<p>-mno-sep-data Generate code that assumes that the data
segment follows the text segment. This is the default.</p>

<p>-mid-shared-library Generate code that supports shared
libraries via the library ID method. This allows for execute
in place and shared libraries in an environment without
virtual memory management. This option implies -fPIC.</p>

<p>-mno-id-shared-library Generate code that doesn t assume
ID based shared libraries are being used. This is the
default.</p>

<p>-mshared-library-id=n Specified the identification
number of the ID based shared library being compiled.
Specifying a value of 0 will generate more compact code,
specifying other values will force the allocation of that
number to the current library but is no more space or time
efficient than omitting this option.</p>

<p>-mxgot -mno-xgot When generating position-independent
code for ColdFire, generate code that works if the GOT has
more than 8192 entries. This code is larger and slower than
code generated without this option. On M680x0 processors,
this option is not needed; -fPIC suffices.</p>

<p>GCC normally uses a single instruction to load values
from the GOT. While this is relatively efficient, it only
works if the GOT is smaller than about 64k. Anything larger
causes the linker to report an error such as:</p>

<p>relocation truncated to fit: R_68K_GOT16O foobar</p>

<p>If this happens, you should recompile your code with
-mxgot. It should then work with very large GOTs. However,
code generated with -mxgot is less efficient, since it takes
4 instructions to fetch the value of a global symbol.</p>

<p>Note that some linkers, including newer versions of the
GNU linker, can create multiple GOTs and sort GOT entries.
If you have such a linker, you should only need to use
-mxgot when compiling a single object file that accesses
more than 8192 GOT entries. Very few do.</p>

<p>These options have no effect unless GCC is generating
position- independent code.</p>

<p>M68hc1x Options These are the -m options defined for the
68hc11 and 68hc12 microcontrollers. The default values for
these options depends on which style of microcontroller was
selected when the compiler was configured; the defaults for
the most common choices are given below.</p>

<p>-m6811 -m68hc11 Generate output for a 68HC11. This is
the default when the compiler is configured for 68HC11-based
systems.</p>

<p>-m6812 -m68hc12 Generate output for a 68HC12. This is
the default when the compiler is configured for 68HC12-based
systems.</p>

<p>-m68S12 -m68hcs12 Generate output for a 68HCS12.</p>

<p>-mauto-incdec Enable the use of 68HC12 pre and post
auto-increment and auto- decrement addressing modes.</p>

<p>-minmax -nominmax Enable the use of 68HC12 min and max
instructions.</p>

<p>-mlong-calls -mno-long-calls Treat all calls as being
far away (near). If calls are assumed to be far away, the
compiler will use the &quot;call&quot; instruction to call a
function and the &quot;rtc&quot; instruction for
returning.</p>

<p>-mshort Consider type &quot;int&quot; to be 16 bits
wide, like &quot;short int&quot;.</p>

<p>-msoft-reg-count=count Specify the number of pseudo-soft
registers which are used for the code generation. The
maximum number is 32. Using more pseudo-soft register may or
may not result in better code depending on the program. The
default is 4 for 68HC11 and 2 for 68HC12.</p>

<p>MCore Options These are the -m options defined for the
Motorola M*Core processors.</p>

<p>-mhardlit -mno-hardlit Inline constants into the code
stream if it can be done in two instructions or less.</p>

<p>-mdiv -mno-div Use the divide instruction. (Enabled by
default).</p>

<p>-mrelax-immediate -mno-relax-immediate Allow arbitrary
sized immediates in bit operations.</p>

<p>-mwide-bitfields -mno-wide-bitfields Always treat
bit-fields as int-sized.</p>

<p>-m4byte-functions -mno-4byte-functions Force all
functions to be aligned to a four byte boundary.</p>

<p>-mcallgraph-data -mno-callgraph-data Emit callgraph
information.</p>

<p>-mslow-bytes -mno-slow-bytes Prefer word access when
reading byte quantities.</p>

<p>-mlittle-endian -mbig-endian Generate code for a little
endian target.</p>

<p>-m210 -m340 Generate code for the 210 processor.</p>

<p>-mno-lsim Assume that run-time support has been provided
and so omit the simulator library (libsim.a) from the linker
command line.</p>

<p>-mstack-increment=size Set the maximum amount for a
single stack increment operation. Large values can increase
the speed of programs which contain functions that need a
large amount of stack space, but they can also trigger a
segmentation fault if the stack is extended too much. The
default value is 0x1000.</p>

<p>MIPS Options -EB Generate big-endian code.</p>

<p>-EL Generate little-endian code. This is the default for
mips*el-*-* configurations.</p>

<p>-march=arch Generate code that will run on arch, which
can be the name of a generic MIPS ISA, or the name of a
particular processor. The ISA names are: mips1, mips2,
mips3, mips4, mips32, mips32r2, mips64 and mips64r2. The
processor names are: 4kc, 4km, 4kp, 4ksc, 4kec, 4kem, 4kep,
4ksd, 5kc, 5kf, 20kc, 24kc, 24kf2_1, 24kf1_1, 24kec,
24kef2_1, 24kef1_1, 34kc, 34kf2_1, 34kf1_1, 74kc, 74kf2_1,
74kf1_1, 74kf3_2, loongson2e, loongson2f, m4k, octeon,
orion, r2000, r3000, r3900, r4000, r4400, r4600, r4650,
r6000, r8000, rm7000, rm9000, r10000, r12000, r14000,
r16000, sb1, sr71000, vr4100, vr4111, vr4120, vr4130,
vr4300, vr5000, vr5400, vr5500 and xlr. The special value
from-abi selects the most compatible architecture for the
selected ABI (that is, mips1 for 32-bit ABIs and mips3 for
64-bit ABIs).</p>

<p>Native Linux/GNU toolchains also support the value
native, which selects the best architecture option for the
host processor. -march=native has no effect if GCC does not
recognize the processor.</p>

<p>In processor names, a final 000 can be abbreviated as k
(for example, -march=r2k). Prefixes are optional, and vr may
be written r.</p>

<p>Names of the form nf2_1 refer to processors with FPUs
clocked at half the rate of the core, names of the form
nf1_1 refer to processors with FPUs clocked at the same rate
as the core, and names of the form nf3_2 refer to processors
with FPUs clocked a ratio of 3:2 with respect to the core.
For compatibility reasons, nf is accepted as a synonym for
nf2_1 while nx and bfx are accepted as synonyms for
nf1_1.</p>

<p>GCC defines two macros based on the value of this
option. The first is _MIPS_ARCH, which gives the name of
target architecture, as a string. The second has the form
_MIPS_ARCH_foo, where foo is the capitalized value of
_MIPS_ARCH. For example, -march=r2000 will set _MIPS_ARCH to
&quot;r2000&quot; and define the macro _MIPS_ARCH_R2000.</p>

<p>Note that the _MIPS_ARCH macro uses the processor names
given above. In other words, it will have the full prefix
and will not abbreviate 000 as k. In the case of from-abi,
the macro names the resolved architecture (either
&quot;mips1&quot; or &quot;mips3&quot;). It names the
default architecture when no -march option is given.</p>

<p>-mtune=arch Optimize for arch. Among other things, this
option controls the way instructions are scheduled, and the
perceived cost of arithmetic operations. The list of arch
values is the same as for -march.</p>

<p>When this option is not used, GCC will optimize for the
processor specified by -march. By using -march and -mtune
together, it is possible to generate code that will run on a
family of processors, but optimize the code for one
particular member of that family.</p>

<p>-mtune defines the macros _MIPS_TUNE and _MIPS_TUNE_foo,
which work in the same way as the -march ones described
above.</p>

<p>-mips1 Equivalent to -march=mips1.</p>

<p>-mips2 Equivalent to -march=mips2.</p>

<p>-mips3 Equivalent to -march=mips3.</p>

<p>-mips4 Equivalent to -march=mips4.</p>

<p>-mips32 Equivalent to -march=mips32.</p>

<p>-mips32r2 Equivalent to -march=mips32r2.</p>

<p>-mips64 Equivalent to -march=mips64.</p>

<p>-mips64r2 Equivalent to -march=mips64r2.</p>

<p>-mips16 -mno-mips16 Generate (do not generate) MIPS16
code. If GCC is targetting a MIPS32 or MIPS64 architecture,
it will make use of the MIPS16e ASE.</p>

<p>MIPS16 code generation can also be controlled on a
per-function basis by means of &quot;mips16&quot; and
&quot;nomips16&quot; attributes.</p>

<p>-mflip-mips16 Generate MIPS16 code on alternating
functions. This option is provided for regression testing of
mixed MIPS16/non-MIPS16 code generation, and is not intended
for ordinary use in compiling user code.</p>

<p>-minterlink-mips16 -mno-interlink-mips16 Require (do not
require) that non-MIPS16 code be link-compatible with MIPS16
code.</p>

<p>For example, non-MIPS16 code cannot jump directly to
MIPS16 code; it must either use a call or an indirect jump.
-minterlink-mips16 therefore disables direct jumps unless
GCC knows that the target of the jump is not MIPS16.</p>

<p>-mabi=32 -mabi=o64 -mabi=n32 -mabi=64 -mabi=eabi
Generate code for the given ABI.</p>

<p>Note that the EABI has a 32-bit and a 64-bit variant.
GCC normally generates 64-bit code when you select a 64-bit
architecture, but you can use -mgp32 to get 32-bit code
instead.</p>

<p>For information about the O64 ABI, see
&lt;http://gcc.gnu.org/projects/mipso64-abi.html&gt;.</p>

<p>GCC supports a variant of the o32 ABI in which
floating-point registers are 64 rather than 32 bits wide.
You can select this combination with -mabi=32 -mfp64. This
ABI relies on the mthc1 and mfhc1 instructions and is
therefore only supported for MIPS32R2 processors.</p>

<p>The register assignments for arguments and return values
remain the same, but each scalar value is passed in a single
64-bit register rather than a pair of 32-bit registers. For
example, scalar floating-point values are returned in $f0
only, not a $f0/$f1 pair. The set of call-saved registers
also remains the same, but all 64 bits are saved.</p>

<p>-mabicalls -mno-abicalls Generate (do not generate) code
that is suitable for SVR4-style dynamic objects. -mabicalls
is the default for SVR4-based systems.</p>

<p>-mshared -mno-shared Generate (do not generate) code
that is fully position-independent, and that can therefore
be linked into shared libraries. This option only affects
-mabicalls.</p>

<p>All -mabicalls code has traditionally been
position-independent, regardless of options like -fPIC and
-fpic. However, as an extension, the GNU toolchain allows
executables to use absolute accesses for locally-binding
symbols. It can also use shorter GP initialization sequences
and generate direct calls to locally- defined functions.
This mode is selected by -mno-shared.</p>

<p>-mno-shared depends on binutils 2.16 or higher and
generates objects that can only be linked by the GNU linker.
However, the option does not affect the ABI of the final
executable; it only affects the ABI of relocatable objects.
Using -mno-shared will generally make executables both
smaller and quicker.</p>

<p>-mshared is the default.</p>

<p>-mplt -mno-plt Assume (do not assume) that the static
and dynamic linkers support PLTs and copy relocations. This
option only affects -mno-shared -mabicalls. For the n64 ABI,
this option has no effect without -msym32.</p>

<p>You can make -mplt the default by configuring GCC with
--with-mips-plt. The default is -mno-plt otherwise.</p>

<p>-mxgot -mno-xgot Lift (do not lift) the usual
restrictions on the size of the global offset table.</p>

<p>GCC normally uses a single instruction to load values
from the GOT. While this is relatively efficient, it will
only work if the GOT is smaller than about 64k. Anything
larger will cause the linker to report an error such as:</p>

<p>relocation truncated to fit: R_MIPS_GOT16 foobar</p>

<p>If this happens, you should recompile your code with
-mxgot. It should then work with very large GOTs, although
it will also be less efficient, since it will take three
instructions to fetch the value of a global symbol.</p>

<p>Note that some linkers can create multiple GOTs. If you
have such a linker, you should only need to use -mxgot when
a single object file accesses more than 64ks worth of GOT
entries. Very few do.</p>

<p>These options have no effect unless GCC is generating
position independent code.</p>

<p>-mgp32 Assume that general-purpose registers are 32 bits
wide.</p>

<p>-mgp64 Assume that general-purpose registers are 64 bits
wide.</p>

<p>-mfp32 Assume that floating-point registers are 32 bits
wide.</p>

<p>-mfp64 Assume that floating-point registers are 64 bits
wide.</p>

<p>-mhard-float Use floating-point coprocessor
instructions.</p>

<p>-msoft-float Do not use floating-point coprocessor
instructions. Implement floating-point calculations using
library calls instead.</p>

<p>-msingle-float Assume that the floating-point
coprocessor only supports single- precision operations.</p>

<p>-mdouble-float Assume that the floating-point
coprocessor supports double- precision operations. This is
the default.</p>

<p>-mllsc -mno-llsc Use (do not use) ll, sc, and sync
instructions to implement atomic memory built-in functions.
When neither option is specified, GCC will use the
instructions if the target architecture supports them.</p>

<p>-mllsc is useful if the runtime environment can emulate
the instructions and -mno-llsc can be useful when compiling
for nonstandard ISAs. You can make either option the default
by configuring GCC with --with-llsc and --without-llsc
respectively. --with-llsc is the default for some
configurations; see the installation documentation for
details.</p>

<p>-mdsp -mno-dsp Use (do not use) revision 1 of the MIPS
DSP ASE. This option defines the preprocessor macro
__mips_dsp. It also defines __mips_dsp_rev to 1.</p>

<p>-mdspr2 -mno-dspr2 Use (do not use) revision 2 of the
MIPS DSP ASE. This option defines the preprocessor macros
__mips_dsp and __mips_dspr2. It also defines __mips_dsp_rev
to 2.</p>

<p>-msmartmips -mno-smartmips Use (do not use) the MIPS
SmartMIPS ASE.</p>

<p>-mpaired-single -mno-paired-single Use (do not use)
paired-single floating-point instructions. This option
requires hardware floating-point support to be enabled.</p>

<p>-mdmx -mno-mdmx Use (do not use) MIPS Digital Media
Extension instructions. This option can only be used when
generating 64-bit code and requires hardware floating-point
support to be enabled.</p>

<p>-mips3d -mno-mips3d Use (do not use) the MIPS-3D ASE.
The option -mips3d implies -mpaired-single.</p>

<p>-mmt -mno-mt Use (do not use) MT Multithreading
instructions.</p>

<p>-mlong64 Force &quot;long&quot; types to be 64 bits
wide. See -mlong32 for an explanation of the default and the
way that the pointer size is determined.</p>

<p>-mlong32 Force &quot;long&quot;, &quot;int&quot;, and
pointer types to be 32 bits wide.</p>

<p>The default size of &quot;int&quot;s, &quot;long&quot;s
and pointers depends on the ABI. All the supported ABIs use
32-bit &quot;int&quot;s. The n64 ABI uses 64-bit
&quot;long&quot;s, as does the 64-bit EABI; the others use
32-bit &quot;long&quot;s. Pointers are the same size as
&quot;long&quot;s, or the same size as integer registers,
whichever is smaller.</p>

<p>-msym32 -mno-sym32 Assume (do not assume) that all
symbols have 32-bit values, regardless of the selected ABI.
This option is useful in combination with -mabi=64 and
-mno-abicalls because it allows GCC to generate shorter and
faster references to symbolic addresses.</p>

<p>-G num Put definitions of externally-visible data in a
small data section if that data is no bigger than num bytes.
GCC can then access the data more efficiently; see -mgpopt
for details.</p>

<p>The default -G option depends on the configuration.</p>

<p>-mlocal-sdata -mno-local-sdata Extend (do not extend)
the -G behavior to local data too, such as to static
variables in C. -mlocal-sdata is the default for all
configurations.</p>

<p>If the linker complains that an application is using too
much small data, you might want to try rebuilding the less
performance- critical parts with -mno-local-sdata. You might
also want to build large libraries with -mno-local-sdata, so
that the libraries leave more room for the main program.</p>

<p>-mextern-sdata -mno-extern-sdata Assume (do not assume)
that externally-defined data will be in a small data section
if that data is within the -G limit. -mextern-sdata is the
default for all configurations.</p>

<p>If you compile a module Mod with -mextern-sdata -G num
-mgpopt, and Mod references a variable Var that is no bigger
than num bytes, you must make sure that Var is placed in a
small data section. If Var is defined by another module, you
must either compile that module with a high-enough -G
setting or attach a &quot;section&quot; attribute to Var s
definition. If Var is common, you must link the application
with a high-enough -G setting.</p>

<p>The easiest way of satisfying these restrictions is to
compile and link every module with the same -G option.
However, you may wish to build a library that supports
several different small data limits. You can do this by
compiling the library with the highest supported -G setting
and additionally using -mno-extern-sdata to stop the library
from making assumptions about externally-defined data.</p>

<p>-mgpopt -mno-gpopt Use (do not use) GP-relative accesses
for symbols that are known to be in a small data section;
see -G, -mlocal-sdata and -mextern-sdata. -mgpopt is the
default for all configurations.</p>

<p>-mno-gpopt is useful for cases where the $gp register
might not hold the value of &quot;_gp&quot;. For example, if
the code is part of a library that might be used in a boot
monitor, programs that call boot monitor routines will pass
an unknown value in $gp. (In such situations, the boot
monitor itself would usually be compiled with -G0.)</p>

<p>-mno-gpopt implies -mno-local-sdata and
-mno-extern-sdata.</p>

<p>-membedded-data -mno-embedded-data Allocate variables to
the read-only data section first if possible, then next in
the small data section if possible, otherwise in data. This
gives slightly slower code than the default, but reduces the
amount of RAM required when executing, and thus may be
preferred for some embedded systems.</p>

<p>-muninit-const-in-rodata -mno-uninit-const-in-rodata Put
uninitialized &quot;const&quot; variables in the read-only
data section. This option is only meaningful in conjunction
with -membedded-data.</p>

<p>-mcode-readable=setting Specify whether GCC may generate
code that reads from executable sections. There are three
possible settings:</p>

<p>-mcode-readable=yes Instructions may freely access
executable sections. This is the default setting.</p>

<p>-mcode-readable=pcrel MIPS16 PC-relative load
instructions can access executable sections, but other
instructions must not do so. This option is useful on 4KSc
and 4KSd processors when the code TLBs have the Read Inhibit
bit set. It is also useful on processors that can be
configured to have a dual instruction/data SRAM interface
and that, like the M4K, automatically redirect PC- relative
loads to the instruction RAM.</p>

<p>-mcode-readable=no Instructions must not access
executable sections. This option can be useful on targets
that are configured to have a dual instruction/data SRAM
interface but that (unlike the M4K) do not automatically
redirect PC-relative loads to the instruction RAM.</p>

<p>-msplit-addresses -mno-split-addresses Enable (disable)
use of the &quot;%hi()&quot; and &quot;%lo()&quot; assembler
relocation operators. This option has been superseded by
-mexplicit-relocs but is retained for backwards
compatibility.</p>

<p>-mexplicit-relocs -mno-explicit-relocs Use (do not use)
assembler relocation operators when dealing with symbolic
addresses. The alternative, selected by
-mno-explicit-relocs, is to use assembler macros
instead.</p>

<p>-mexplicit-relocs is the default if GCC was configured
to use an assembler that supports relocation operators.</p>

<p>-mcheck-zero-division -mno-check-zero-division Trap (do
not trap) on integer division by zero.</p>

<p>The default is -mcheck-zero-division.</p>

<p>-mdivide-traps -mdivide-breaks MIPS systems check for
division by zero by generating either a conditional trap or
a break instruction. Using traps results in smaller code,
but is only supported on MIPS II and later. Also, some
versions of the Linux kernel have a bug that prevents trap
from generating the proper signal (&quot;SIGFPE&quot;). Use
-mdivide-traps to allow conditional traps on architectures
that support them and -mdivide-breaks to force the use of
breaks.</p>

<p>The default is usually -mdivide-traps, but this can be
overridden at configure time using --with-divide=breaks.
Divide-by-zero checks can be completely disabled using
-mno-check-zero-division.</p>

<p>-mmemcpy -mno-memcpy Force (do not force) the use of
&quot;memcpy()&quot; for non-trivial block moves. The
default is -mno-memcpy, which allows GCC to inline most
constant-sized copies.</p>

<p>-mlong-calls -mno-long-calls Disable (do not disable)
use of the &quot;jal&quot; instruction. Calling functions
using &quot;jal&quot; is more efficient but requires the
caller and callee to be in the same 256 megabyte
segment.</p>

<p>This option has no effect on abicalls code. The default
is -mno-long-calls.</p>

<p>-mmad -mno-mad Enable (disable) use of the
&quot;mad&quot;, &quot;madu&quot; and &quot;mul&quot;
instructions, as provided by the R4650 ISA.</p>

<p>-mfused-madd -mno-fused-madd Enable (disable) use of the
floating point multiply-accumulate instructions, when they
are available. The default is -mfused-madd.</p>

<p>When multiply-accumulate instructions are used, the
intermediate product is calculated to infinite precision and
is not subject to the FCSR Flush to Zero bit. This may be
undesirable in some circumstances.</p>

<p>-nocpp Tell the MIPS assembler to not run its
preprocessor over user assembler files (with a .s suffix)
when assembling them.</p>

<p>-mfix-r4000 -mno-fix-r4000 Work around certain R4000 CPU
errata:</p>

<p>- A double-word or a variable shift may give an
incorrect result if executed immediately after starting an
integer division.</p>

<p>- A double-word or a variable shift may give an
incorrect result if executed while an integer multiplication
is in progress.</p>

<p>- An integer division may give an incorrect result if
started in a delay slot of a taken branch or a jump.</p>

<p>-mfix-r4400 -mno-fix-r4400 Work around certain R4400 CPU
errata:</p>

<p>- A double-word or a variable shift may give an
incorrect result if executed immediately after starting an
integer division.</p>

<p>-mfix-r10000 -mno-fix-r10000 Work around certain R10000
errata:</p>

<p>- &quot;ll&quot;/&quot;sc&quot; sequences may not behave
atomically on revisions prior to 3.0. They may deadlock on
revisions 2.6 and earlier.</p>

<p>This option can only be used if the target architecture
supports branch-likely instructions. -mfix-r10000 is the
default when -march=r10000 is used; -mno-fix-r10000 is the
default otherwise.</p>

<p>-mfix-vr4120 -mno-fix-vr4120 Work around certain VR4120
errata:</p>

<p>- &quot;dmultu&quot; does not always produce the correct
result.</p>

<p>- &quot;div&quot; and &quot;ddiv&quot; do not always
produce the correct result if one of the operands is
negative.</p>

<p>The workarounds for the division errata rely on special
functions in libgcc.a. At present, these functions are only
provided by the &quot;mips64vr*-elf&quot;
configurations.</p>

<p>Other VR4120 errata require a nop to be inserted between
certain pairs of instructions. These errata are handled by
the assembler, not by GCC itself.</p>

<p>-mfix-vr4130 Work around the VR4130
&quot;mflo&quot;/&quot;mfhi&quot; errata. The workarounds
are implemented by the assembler rather than by GCC,
although GCC will avoid using &quot;mflo&quot; and
&quot;mfhi&quot; if the VR4130 &quot;macc&quot;,
&quot;macchi&quot;, &quot;dmacc&quot; and
&quot;dmacchi&quot; instructions are available instead.</p>

<p>-mfix-sb1 -mno-fix-sb1 Work around certain SB-1 CPU core
errata. (This flag currently works around the SB-1 revision
2 &quot;F1&quot; and &quot;F2&quot; floating point
errata.)</p>

<p>-mr10k-cache-barrier=setting Specify whether GCC should
insert cache barriers to avoid the side- effects of
speculation on R10K processors.</p>

<p>In common with many processors, the R10K tries to
predict the outcome of a conditional branch and
speculatively executes instructions from the
&quot;taken&quot; branch. It later aborts these instructions
if the predicted outcome was wrong. However, on the R10K,
even aborted instructions can have side effects.</p>

<p>This problem only affects kernel stores and, depending
on the system, kernel loads. As an example, a
speculatively-executed store may load the target memory into
cache and mark the cache line as dirty, even if the store
itself is later aborted. If a DMA operation writes to the
same area of memory before the &quot;dirty&quot; line is
flushed, the cached data will overwrite the DMA-ed data. See
the R10K processor manual for a full description, including
other potential problems.</p>

<p>One workaround is to insert cache barrier instructions
before every memory access that might be speculatively
executed and that might have side effects even if aborted.
-mr10k-cache-barrier=setting controls GCCs implementation of
this workaround. It assumes that aborted accesses to any
byte in the following regions will not have side
effects:</p>

<p>1. the memory occupied by the current functions stack
frame;</p>

<p>2. the memory occupied by an incoming stack
argument;</p>

<p>3. the memory occupied by an object with a
link-time-constant address.</p>

<p>It is the kernel s responsibility to ensure that
speculative accesses to these regions are indeed safe.</p>

<p>If the input program contains a function declaration
such as:</p>

<p>void foo (void);</p>

<p>then the implementation of &quot;foo&quot; must allow
&quot;j foo&quot; and &quot;jal foo&quot; to be executed
speculatively. GCC honors this restriction for functions it
compiles itself. It expects non-GCC functions (such as
hand-written assembly code) to do the same.</p>

<p>The option has three forms:</p>

<p>-mr10k-cache-barrier=load-store Insert a cache barrier
before a load or store that might be speculatively executed
and that might have side effects even if aborted.</p>

<p>-mr10k-cache-barrier=store Insert a cache barrier before
a store that might be speculatively executed and that might
have side effects even if aborted.</p>

<p>-mr10k-cache-barrier=none Disable the insertion of cache
barriers. This is the default setting.</p>

<p>-mflush-func=func -mno-flush-func Specifies the function
to call to flush the I and D caches, or to not call any such
function. If called, the function must take the same
arguments as the common &quot;_flush_func()&quot;, that is,
the address of the memory range for which the cache is being
flushed, the size of the memory range, and the number 3 (to
flush both caches). The default depends on the target GCC
was configured for, but commonly is either _flush_func or
__cpu_flush.</p>

<p>mbranch-cost=num Set the cost of branches to roughly num
&quot;simple&quot; instructions. This cost is only a
heuristic and is not guaranteed to produce consistent
results across releases. A zero cost redundantly selects the
default, which is based on the -mtune setting.</p>

<p>-mbranch-likely -mno-branch-likely Enable or disable use
of Branch Likely instructions, regardless of the default for
the selected architecture. By default, Branch Likely
instructions may be generated if they are supported by the
selected architecture. An exception is for the MIPS32 and
MIPS64 architectures and processors which implement those
architectures; for those, Branch Likely instructions will
not be generated by default because the MIPS32 and MIPS64
architectures specifically deprecate their use.</p>

<p>-mfp-exceptions -mno-fp-exceptions Specifies whether FP
exceptions are enabled. This affects how we schedule FP
instructions for some processors. The default is that FP
exceptions are enabled.</p>

<p>For instance, on the SB-1, if FP exceptions are
disabled, and we are emitting 64-bit code, then we can use
both FP pipes. Otherwise, we can only use one FP pipe.</p>

<p>-mvr4130-align -mno-vr4130-align The VR4130 pipeline is
two-way superscalar, but can only issue two instructions
together if the first one is 8-byte aligned. When this
option is enabled, GCC will align pairs of instructions that
it thinks should execute in parallel.</p>

<p>This option only has an effect when optimizing for the
VR4130. It normally makes code faster, but at the expense of
making it bigger. It is enabled by default at optimization
level -O3.</p>

<p>MMIX Options These options are defined for the MMIX:</p>

<p>-mlibfuncs -mno-libfuncs Specify that intrinsic library
functions are being compiled, passing all values in
registers, no matter the size.</p>

<p>-mepsilon -mno-epsilon Generate floating-point
comparison instructions that compare with respect to the
&quot;rE&quot; epsilon register.</p>

<p>-mabi=mmixware -mabi=gnu Generate code that passes
function parameters and return values that (in the called
function) are seen as registers $0 and up, as opposed to the
GNU ABI which uses global registers $231 and up.</p>

<p>-mzero-extend -mno-zero-extend When reading data from
memory in sizes shorter than 64 bits, use (do not use)
zero-extending load instructions by default, rather than
sign-extending ones.</p>

<p>-mknuthdiv -mno-knuthdiv Make the result of a division
yielding a remainder have the same sign as the divisor. With
the default, -mno-knuthdiv, the sign of the remainder
follows the sign of the dividend. Both methods are
arithmetically valid, the latter being almost exclusively
used.</p>

<p>-mtoplevel-symbols -mno-toplevel-symbols Prepend (do not
prepend) a : to all global symbols, so the assembly code can
be used with the &quot;PREFIX&quot; assembly directive.</p>

<p>-melf Generate an executable in the ELF format, rather
than the default mmo format used by the mmix simulator.</p>

<p>-mbranch-predict -mno-branch-predict Use (do not use)
the probable-branch instructions, when static branch
prediction indicates a probable branch.</p>

<p>-mbase-addresses -mno-base-addresses Generate (do not
generate) code that uses base addresses. Using a base
address automatically generates a request (handled by the
assembler and the linker) for a constant to be set up in a
global register. The register is used for one or more base
address requests within the range 0 to 255 from the value
held in the register. The generally leads to short and fast
code, but the number of different data items that can be
addressed is limited. This means that a program that uses
lots of static data may require -mno-base-addresses.</p>

<p>-msingle-exit -mno-single-exit Force (do not force)
generated code to have a single exit point in each
function.</p>

<p>MN10300 Options These -m options are defined for
Matsushita MN10300 architectures:</p>

<p>-mmult-bug Generate code to avoid bugs in the multiply
instructions for the MN10300 processors. This is the
default.</p>

<p>-mno-mult-bug Do not generate code to avoid bugs in the
multiply instructions for the MN10300 processors.</p>

<p>-mam33 Generate code which uses features specific to the
AM33 processor.</p>

<p>-mno-am33 Do not generate code which uses features
specific to the AM33 processor. This is the default.</p>

<p>-mreturn-pointer-on-d0 When generating a function which
returns a pointer, return the pointer in both &quot;a0&quot;
and &quot;d0&quot;. Otherwise, the pointer is returned only
in a0, and attempts to call such functions without a
prototype would result in errors. Note that this option is
on by default; use -mno-return-pointer-on-d0 to disable
it.</p>

<p>-mno-crt0 Do not link in the C run-time initialization
object file.</p>

<p>-mrelax Indicate to the linker that it should perform a
relaxation optimization pass to shorten branches, calls and
absolute memory addresses. This option only has an effect
when used on the command line for the final link step.</p>

<p>This option makes symbolic debugging impossible.</p>

<p>PDP-11 Options These options are defined for the
PDP-11:</p>

<p>-mfpu Use hardware FPP floating point. This is the
default. (FIS floating point on the PDP-11/40 is not
supported.)</p>

<p>-msoft-float Do not use hardware floating point.</p>

<p>-mac0 Return floating-point results in ac0 (fr0 in Unix
assembler syntax).</p>

<p>-mno-ac0 Return floating-point results in memory. This
is the default.</p>

<p>-m40 Generate code for a PDP-11/40.</p>

<p>-m45 Generate code for a PDP-11/45. This is the
default.</p>

<p>-m10 Generate code for a PDP-11/10.</p>

<p>-mbcopy-builtin Use inline &quot;movmemhi&quot; patterns
for copying memory. This is the default.</p>

<p>-mbcopy Do not use inline &quot;movmemhi&quot; patterns
for copying memory.</p>

<p>-mint16 -mno-int32 Use 16-bit &quot;int&quot;. This is
the default.</p>

<p>-mint32 -mno-int16 Use 32-bit &quot;int&quot;.</p>

<p>-mfloat64 -mno-float32 Use 64-bit &quot;float&quot;.
This is the default.</p>

<p>-mfloat32 -mno-float64 Use 32-bit &quot;float&quot;.</p>

<p>-mabshi Use &quot;abshi2&quot; pattern. This is the
default.</p>

<p>-mno-abshi Do not use &quot;abshi2&quot; pattern.</p>

<p>-mbranch-expensive Pretend that branches are expensive.
This is for experimenting with code generation only.</p>

<p>-mbranch-cheap Do not pretend that branches are
expensive. This is the default.</p>

<p>-msplit Generate code for a system with split
I&amp;D.</p>

<p>-mno-split Generate code for a system without split
I&amp;D. This is the default.</p>

<p>-munix-asm Use Unix assembler syntax. This is the
default when configured for pdp11-*-bsd.</p>

<p>-mdec-asm Use DEC assembler syntax. This is the default
when configured for any PDP-11 target other than
pdp11-*-bsd.</p>

<p>picoChip Options These -m options are defined for
picoChip implementations:</p>

<p>-mae=ae_type Set the instruction set, register set, and
instruction scheduling parameters for array element type
ae_type. Supported values for ae_type are ANY, MUL, and
MAC.</p>

<p>-mae=ANY selects a completely generic AE type. Code
generated with this option will run on any of the other AE
types. The code will not be as efficient as it would be if
compiled for a specific AE type, and some types of operation
(e.g., multiplication) will not work properly on all types
of AE.</p>

<p>-mae=MUL selects a MUL AE type. This is the most useful
AE type for compiled code, and is the default.</p>

<p>-mae=MAC selects a DSP-style MAC AE. Code compiled with
this option may suffer from poor performance of byte (char)
manipulation, since the DSP AE does not provide hardware
support for byte load/stores.</p>

<p>-msymbol-as-address Enable the compiler to directly use
a symbol name as an address in a load/store instruction,
without first loading it into a register. Typically, the use
of this option will generate larger programs, which run
faster than when the option isn t used. However, the results
vary from program to program, so it is left as a user
option, rather than being permanently enabled.</p>

<p>-mno-inefficient-warnings Disables warnings about the
generation of inefficient code. These warnings can be
generated, for example, when compiling code which performs
byte-level memory operations on the MAC AE type. The MAC AE
has no hardware support for byte-level memory operations, so
all byte load/stores must be synthesized from word
load/store operations. This is inefficient and a warning
will be generated indicating to the programmer that they
should rewrite the code to avoid byte operations, or to
target an AE type which has the necessary hardware support.
This option enables the warning to be turned off.</p>

<p>PowerPC Options These are listed under</p>

<p>IBM RS/6000 and PowerPC Options These -m options are
defined for the IBM RS/6000 and PowerPC:</p>

<p>-mpower -mno-power -mpower2 -mno-power2 -mpowerpc
-mno-powerpc -mpowerpc-gpopt -mno-powerpc-gpopt
-mpowerpc-gfxopt -mno-powerpc-gfxopt -mpowerpc64
-mno-powerpc64 -mmfcrf -mno-mfcrf -mpopcntb -mno-popcntb
-mpopcntd -mno-popcntd -mfprnd -mno-fprnd -mcmpb -mno-cmpb
-mmfpgpr -mno-mfpgpr -mhard-dfp -mno-hard-dfp GCC supports
two related instruction set architectures for the RS/6000
and PowerPC. The POWER instruction set are those
instructions supported by the rios chip set used in the
original RS/6000 systems and the PowerPC instruction set is
the architecture of the Freescale MPC5xx, MPC6xx, MPC8xx
microprocessors, and the IBM 4xx, 6xx, and follow-on
microprocessors.</p>

<p>Neither architecture is a subset of the other. However
there is a large common subset of instructions supported by
both. An MQ register is included in processors supporting
the POWER architecture.</p>

<p>You use these options to specify which instructions are
available on the processor you are using. The default value
of these options is determined when configuring GCC.
Specifying the -mcpu=cpu_type overrides the specification of
these options. We recommend you use the -mcpu=cpu_type
option rather than the options listed above.</p>

<p>The -mpower option allows GCC to generate instructions
that are found only in the POWER architecture and to use the
MQ register. Specifying -mpower2 implies -power and also
allows GCC to generate instructions that are present in the
POWER2 architecture but not the original POWER
architecture.</p>

<p>The -mpowerpc option allows GCC to generate instructions
that are found only in the 32-bit subset of the PowerPC
architecture. Specifying -mpowerpc-gpopt implies -mpowerpc
and also allows GCC to use the optional PowerPC architecture
instructions in the General Purpose group, including
floating-point square root. Specifying -mpowerpc-gfxopt
implies -mpowerpc and also allows GCC to use the optional
PowerPC architecture instructions in the Graphics group,
including floating-point select.</p>

<p>The -mmfcrf option allows GCC to generate the move from
condition register field instruction implemented on the
POWER4 processor and other processors that support the
PowerPC V2.01 architecture. The -mpopcntb option allows GCC
to generate the popcount and double precision FP reciprocal
estimate instruction implemented on the POWER5 processor and
other processors that support the PowerPC V2.02
architecture. The -mpopcntd option allows GCC to generate
the popcount instruction implemented on the POWER7 processor
and other processors that support the PowerPC V2.06
architecture. The -mfprnd option allows GCC to generate the
FP round to integer instructions implemented on the POWER5+
processor and other processors that support the PowerPC
V2.03 architecture. The -mcmpb option allows GCC to generate
the compare bytes instruction implemented on the POWER6
processor and other processors that support the PowerPC
V2.05 architecture. The -mmfpgpr option allows GCC to
generate the FP move to/from general purpose register
instructions implemented on the POWER6X processor and other
processors that support the extended PowerPC V2.05
architecture. The -mhard-dfp option allows GCC to generate
the decimal floating point instructions implemented on some
POWER processors.</p>

<p>The -mpowerpc64 option allows GCC to generate the
additional 64-bit instructions that are found in the full
PowerPC64 architecture and to treat GPRs as 64-bit,
doubleword quantities. GCC defaults to -mno-powerpc64.</p>

<p>If you specify both -mno-power and -mno-powerpc, GCC
will use only the instructions in the common subset of both
architectures plus some special AIX common-mode calls, and
will not use the MQ register. Specifying both -mpower and
-mpowerpc permits GCC to use any instruction from either
architecture and to allow use of the MQ register; specify
this for the Motorola MPC601.</p>

<p>-mnew-mnemonics -mold-mnemonics Select which mnemonics
to use in the generated assembler code. With
-mnew-mnemonics, GCC uses the assembler mnemonics defined
for the PowerPC architecture. With -mold-mnemonics it uses
the assembler mnemonics defined for the POWER architecture.
Instructions defined in only one architecture have only one
mnemonic; GCC uses that mnemonic irrespective of which of
these options is specified.</p>

<p>GCC defaults to the mnemonics appropriate for the
architecture in use. Specifying -mcpu=cpu_type sometimes
overrides the value of these option. Unless you are building
a cross-compiler, you should normally not specify either
-mnew-mnemonics or -mold-mnemonics, but should instead
accept the default.</p>

<p>-mcpu=cpu_type Set architecture type, register usage,
choice of mnemonics, and instruction scheduling parameters
for machine type cpu_type. Supported values for cpu_type are
401, 403, 405, 405fp, 440, 440fp, 464, 464fp, 505, 601, 602,
603, 603e, 604, 604e, 620, 630, 740, 7400, 7450, 750, 801,
821, 823, 860, 970, 8540, e300c2, e300c3, e500mc, ec603e,
G3, G4, G5, power, power2, power3, power4, power5, power5+,
power6, power6x, power7, common, powerpc, powerpc64, rios,
rios1, rios2, rsc, and rs64.</p>

<p>-mcpu=common selects a completely generic processor.
Code generated under this option will run on any POWER or
PowerPC processor. GCC will use only the instructions in the
common subset of both architectures, and will not use the MQ
register. GCC assumes a generic processor model for
scheduling purposes.</p>

<p>-mcpu=power, -mcpu=power2, -mcpu=powerpc, and
-mcpu=powerpc64 specify generic POWER, POWER2, pure 32-bit
PowerPC (i.e., not MPC601), and 64-bit PowerPC architecture
machine types, with an appropriate, generic processor model
assumed for scheduling purposes.</p>

<p>The other options specify a specific processor. Code
generated under those options will run best on that
processor, and may not run at all on others.</p>

<p>The -mcpu options automatically enable or disable the
following options:</p>

<p>-maltivec -mfprnd -mhard-float -mmfcrf -mmultiple
-mnew-mnemonics -mpopcntb -mpopcntd -mpower -mpower2
-mpowerpc64 -mpowerpc-gpopt -mpowerpc-gfxopt -msingle-float
-mdouble-float -msimple-fpu -mstring -mmulhw -mdlmzb
-mmfpgpr -mvsx</p>

<p>The particular options set for any particular CPU will
vary between compiler versions, depending on what setting
seems to produce optimal code for that CPU; it doesn t
necessarily reflect the actual hardwares capabilities. If
you wish to set an individual option to a particular value,
you may specify it after the -mcpu option, like -mcpu=970
-mno-altivec.</p>

<p>On AIX, the -maltivec and -mpowerpc64 options are not
enabled or disabled by the -mcpu option at present because
AIX does not have full support for these options. You may
still enable or disable them individually if youre sure it
ll work in your environment.</p>

<p>-mtune=cpu_type Set the instruction scheduling
parameters for machine type cpu_type, but do not set the
architecture type, register usage, or choice of mnemonics,
as -mcpu=cpu_type would. The same values for cpu_type are
used for -mtune as for -mcpu. If both are specified, the
code generated will use the architecture, registers, and
mnemonics set by -mcpu, but the scheduling parameters set by
-mtune.</p>

<p>-mswdiv -mno-swdiv Generate code to compute division as
reciprocal estimate and iterative refinement, creating
opportunities for increased throughput. This feature
requires: optional PowerPC Graphics instruction set for
single precision and FRE instruction for double precision,
assuming divides cannot generate user-visible traps, and the
domain values not include Infinities, denormals or zero
denominator.</p>

<p>-maltivec -mno-altivec Generate code that uses (does not
use) AltiVec instructions, and also enable the use of
built-in functions that allow more direct access to the
AltiVec instruction set. You may also need to set
-mabi=altivec to adjust the current ABI with AltiVec ABI
enhancements.</p>

<p>-mvrsave -mno-vrsave Generate VRSAVE instructions when
generating AltiVec code.</p>

<p>-mgen-cell-microcode Generate Cell microcode
instructions</p>

<p>-mwarn-cell-microcode Warning when a Cell microcode
instruction is going to emitted. An example of a Cell
microcode instruction is a variable shift.</p>

<p>-msecure-plt Generate code that allows ld and ld.so to
build executables and shared libraries with non-exec .plt
and .got sections. This is a PowerPC 32-bit SYSV ABI
option.</p>

<p>-mbss-plt Generate code that uses a BSS .plt section
that ld.so fills in, and requires .plt and .got sections
that are both writable and executable. This is a PowerPC
32-bit SYSV ABI option.</p>

<p>-misel -mno-isel This switch enables or disables the
generation of ISEL instructions.</p>

<p>-misel=yes/no This switch has been deprecated. Use
-misel and -mno-isel instead.</p>

<p>-mspe -mno-spe This switch enables or disables the
generation of SPE simd instructions.</p>

<p>-mpaired -mno-paired This switch enables or disables the
generation of PAIRED simd instructions.</p>

<p>-mspe=yes/no This option has been deprecated. Use -mspe
and -mno-spe instead.</p>

<p>-mvsx -mno-vsx Generate code that uses (does not use)
vector/scalar (VSX) instructions, and also enable the use of
built-in functions that allow more direct access to the VSX
instruction set.</p>

<p>-mfloat-gprs=yes/single/double/no -mfloat-gprs This
switch enables or disables the generation of floating point
operations on the general purpose registers for
architectures that support it.</p>

<p>The argument yes or single enables the use of
single-precision floating point operations.</p>

<p>The argument double enables the use of single and
double-precision floating point operations.</p>

<p>The argument no disables floating point operations on
the general purpose registers.</p>

<p>This option is currently only available on the
MPC854x.</p>

<p>-m32 -m64 Generate code for 32-bit or 64-bit
environments of Darwin and SVR4 targets (including
GNU/Linux). The 32-bit environment sets int, long and
pointer to 32 bits and generates code that runs on any
PowerPC variant. The 64-bit environment sets int to 32 bits
and long and pointer to 64 bits, and generates code for
PowerPC64, as for -mpowerpc64.</p>

<p>-mfull-toc -mno-fp-in-toc -mno-sum-in-toc -mminimal-toc
Modify generation of the TOC (Table Of Contents), which is
created for every executable file. The -mfull-toc option is
selected by default. In that case, GCC will allocate at
least one TOC entry for each unique non-automatic variable
reference in your program. GCC will also place
floating-point constants in the TOC. However, only 16,384
entries are available in the TOC.</p>

<p>If you receive a linker error message that saying you
have overflowed the available TOC space, you can reduce the
amount of TOC space used with the -mno-fp-in-toc and
-mno-sum-in-toc options. -mno-fp-in-toc prevents GCC from
putting floating-point constants in the TOC and
-mno-sum-in-toc forces GCC to generate code to calculate the
sum of an address and a constant at run-time instead of
putting that sum into the TOC. You may specify one or both
of these options. Each causes GCC to produce very slightly
slower and larger code at the expense of conserving TOC
space.</p>

<p>If you still run out of space in the TOC even when you
specify both of these options, specify -mminimal-toc
instead. This option causes GCC to make only one TOC entry
for every file. When you specify this option, GCC will
produce code that is slower and larger but which uses
extremely little TOC space. You may wish to use this option
only on files that contain less frequently executed
code.</p>

<p>-maix64 -maix32 Enable 64-bit AIX ABI and calling
convention: 64-bit pointers, 64-bit &quot;long&quot; type,
and the infrastructure needed to support them. Specifying
-maix64 implies -mpowerpc64 and -mpowerpc, while -maix32
disables the 64-bit ABI and implies -mno-powerpc64. GCC
defaults to -maix32.</p>

<p>-mxl-compat -mno-xl-compat Produce code that conforms
more closely to IBM XL compiler semantics when using
AIX-compatible ABI. Pass floating-point arguments to
prototyped functions beyond the register save area (RSA) on
the stack in addition to argument FPRs. Do not assume that
most significant double in 128-bit long double value is
properly rounded when comparing values and converting to
double. Use XL symbol names for long double support
routines.</p>

<p>The AIX calling convention was extended but not
initially documented to handle an obscure K&amp;R C case of
calling a function that takes the address of its arguments
with fewer arguments than declared. IBM XL compilers access
floating point arguments which do not fit in the RSA from
the stack when a subroutine is compiled without
optimization. Because always storing floating-point
arguments on the stack is inefficient and rarely needed,
this option is not enabled by default and only is necessary
when calling subroutines compiled by IBM XL compilers
without optimization.</p>

<p>-mpe Support IBM RS/6000 SP Parallel Environment (PE).
Link an application written to use message passing with
special startup code to enable the application to run. The
system must have PE installed in the standard location
(/usr/lpp/ppe.poe/), or the specs file must be overridden
with the -specs= option to specify the appropriate directory
location. The Parallel Environment does not support threads,
so the -mpe option and the -pthread option are
incompatible.</p>

<p>-malign-natural -malign-power On AIX, 32-bit Darwin, and
64-bit PowerPC GNU/Linux, the option -malign-natural
overrides the ABI-defined alignment of larger types, such as
floating-point doubles, on their natural size-based
boundary. The option -malign-power instructs GCC to follow
the ABI-specified alignment rules. GCC defaults to the
standard alignment defined in the ABI.</p>

<p>On 64-bit Darwin, natural alignment is the default, and
-malign-power is not supported.</p>

<p>-msoft-float -mhard-float Generate code that does not
use (uses) the floating-point register set. Software
floating point emulation is provided if you use the
-msoft-float option, and pass the option to GCC when
linking.</p>

<p>-msingle-float -mdouble-float Generate code for single
or double-precision floating point operations.
-mdouble-float implies -msingle-float.</p>

<p>-msimple-fpu Do not generate sqrt and div instructions
for hardware floating point unit.</p>

<p>-mfpu Specify type of floating point unit. Valid values
are sp_lite (equivalent to -msingle-float -msimple-fpu),
dp_lite (equivalent to -mdouble-float -msimple-fpu), sp_full
(equivalent to -msingle-float), and dp_full (equivalent to
-mdouble-float).</p>

<p>-mxilinx-fpu Perform optimizations for floating point
unit on Xilinx PPC 405/440.</p>

<p>-mmultiple -mno-multiple Generate code that uses (does
not use) the load multiple word instructions and the store
multiple word instructions. These instructions are generated
by default on POWER systems, and not generated on PowerPC
systems. Do not use -mmultiple on little endian PowerPC
systems, since those instructions do not work when the
processor is in little endian mode. The exceptions are
PPC740 and PPC750 which permit the instructions usage in
little endian mode.</p>

<p>-mstring -mno-string Generate code that uses (does not
use) the load string instructions and the store string word
instructions to save multiple registers and do small block
moves. These instructions are generated by default on POWER
systems, and not generated on PowerPC systems. Do not use
-mstring on little endian PowerPC systems, since those
instructions do not work when the processor is in little
endian mode. The exceptions are PPC740 and PPC750 which
permit the instructions usage in little endian mode.</p>

<p>-mupdate -mno-update Generate code that uses (does not
use) the load or store instructions that update the base
register to the address of the calculated memory location.
These instructions are generated by default. If you use
-mno-update, there is a small window between the time that
the stack pointer is updated and the address of the previous
frame is stored, which means code that walks the stack frame
across interrupts or signals may get corrupted data.</p>

<p>-mavoid-indexed-addresses -mno-avoid-indexed-addresses
Generate code that tries to avoid (not avoid) the use of
indexed load or store instructions. These instructions can
incur a performance penalty on Power6 processors in certain
situations, such as when stepping through large arrays that
cross a 16M boundary. This option is enabled by default when
targetting Power6 and disabled otherwise.</p>

<p>-mfused-madd -mno-fused-madd Generate code that uses
(does not use) the floating point multiply and accumulate
instructions. These instructions are generated by default if
hardware floating is used.</p>

<p>-mmulhw -mno-mulhw Generate code that uses (does not
use) the half-word multiply and multiply-accumulate
instructions on the IBM 405, 440 and 464 processors. These
instructions are generated by default when targetting those
processors.</p>

<p>-mdlmzb -mno-dlmzb Generate code that uses (does not
use) the string-search dlmzb instruction on the IBM 405, 440
and 464 processors. This instruction is generated by default
when targetting those processors.</p>

<p>-mno-bit-align -mbit-align On System V.4 and embedded
PowerPC systems do not (do) force structures and unions that
contain bit-fields to be aligned to the base type of the
bit-field.</p>

<p>For example, by default a structure containing nothing
but 8 &quot;unsigned&quot; bit-fields of length 1 would be
aligned to a 4 byte boundary and have a size of 4 bytes. By
using -mno-bit-align, the structure would be aligned to a 1
byte boundary and be one byte in size.</p>

<p>-mno-strict-align -mstrict-align On System V.4 and
embedded PowerPC systems do not (do) assume that unaligned
memory references will be handled by the system.</p>

<p>-mrelocatable -mno-relocatable On embedded PowerPC
systems generate code that allows (does not allow) the
program to be relocated to a different address at runtime.
If you use -mrelocatable on any module, all objects linked
together must be compiled with -mrelocatable or
-mrelocatable-lib.</p>

<p>-mrelocatable-lib -mno-relocatable-lib On embedded
PowerPC systems generate code that allows (does not allow)
the program to be relocated to a different address at
runtime. Modules compiled with -mrelocatable-lib can be
linked with either modules compiled without -mrelocatable
and -mrelocatable-lib or with modules compiled with the
-mrelocatable options.</p>

<p>-mno-toc -mtoc On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC
systems do not (do) assume that register 2 contains a
pointer to a global area pointing to the addresses used in
the program.</p>

<p>-mlittle -mlittle-endian On System V.4 and embedded
PowerPC systems compile code for the processor in little
endian mode. The -mlittle-endian option is the same as
-mlittle.</p>

<p>-mbig -mbig-endian On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC
systems compile code for the processor in big endian mode.
The -mbig-endian option is the same as -mbig.</p>

<p>-mdynamic-no-pic On Darwin and Mac OS X systems, compile
code so that it is not relocatable, but that its external
references are relocatable. The resulting code is suitable
for applications, but not shared libraries.</p>

<p>-mprioritize-restricted-insns=priority This option
controls the priority that is assigned to dispatch-slot
restricted instructions during the second scheduling pass.
The argument priority takes the value 0/1/2 to assign
no/highest/second-highest priority to dispatch slot
restricted instructions.</p>

<p>-msched-costly-dep=dependence_type This option controls
which dependences are considered costly by the target during
instruction scheduling. The argument dependence_type takes
one of the following values: no: no dependence is costly,
all: all dependences are costly, true_store_to_load: a true
dependence from store to load is costly, store_to_load: any
dependence from store to load is costly, number: any
dependence which latency &gt;= number is costly.</p>

<p>-minsert-sched-nops=scheme This option controls which
nop insertion scheme will be used during the second
scheduling pass. The argument scheme takes one of the
following values: no: Dont insert nops. pad: Pad with nops
any dispatch group which has vacant issue slots, according
to the scheduler s grouping. regroup_exact: Insert nops to
force costly dependent insns into separate groups. Insert
exactly as many nops as needed to force an insn to a new
group, according to the estimated processor grouping.
number: Insert nops to force costly dependent insns into
separate groups. Insert number nops to force an insn to a
new group.</p>

<p>-mcall-sysv On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems
compile code using calling conventions that adheres to the
March 1995 draft of the System V Application Binary
Interface, PowerPC processor supplement. This is the default
unless you configured GCC using powerpc-*-eabiaix.</p>

<p>-mcall-sysv-eabi Specify both -mcall-sysv and -meabi
options.</p>

<p>-mcall-sysv-noeabi Specify both -mcall-sysv and
-mno-eabi options.</p>

<p>-mcall-solaris On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC
systems compile code for the Solaris operating system.</p>

<p>-mcall-linux On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems
compile code for the Linux-based GNU system.</p>

<p>-mcall-gnu On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems
compile code for the Hurd-based GNU system.</p>

<p>-mcall-netbsd On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems
compile code for the NetBSD operating system.</p>

<p>-maix-struct-return Return all structures in memory (as
specified by the AIX ABI).</p>

<p>-msvr4-struct-return Return structures smaller than 8
bytes in registers (as specified by the SVR4 ABI).</p>

<p>-mabi=abi-type Extend the current ABI with a particular
extension, or remove such extension. Valid values are
altivec, no-altivec, spe, no-spe, ibmlongdouble,
ieeelongdouble.</p>

<p>-mabi=spe Extend the current ABI with SPE ABI
extensions. This does not change the default ABI, instead it
adds the SPE ABI extensions to the current ABI.</p>

<p>-mabi=no-spe Disable Booke SPE ABI extensions for the
current ABI.</p>

<p>-mabi=ibmlongdouble Change the current ABI to use IBM
extended precision long double. This is a PowerPC 32-bit
SYSV ABI option.</p>

<p>-mabi=ieeelongdouble Change the current ABI to use IEEE
extended precision long double. This is a PowerPC 32-bit
Linux ABI option.</p>

<p>-mprototype -mno-prototype On System V.4 and embedded
PowerPC systems assume that all calls to variable argument
functions are properly prototyped. Otherwise, the compiler
must insert an instruction before every non prototyped call
to set or clear bit 6 of the condition code register (CR) to
indicate whether floating point values were passed in the
floating point registers in case the function takes a
variable arguments. With -mprototype, only calls to
prototyped variable argument functions will set or clear the
bit.</p>

<p>-msim On embedded PowerPC systems, assume that the
startup module is called sim-crt0.o and that the standard C
libraries are libsim.a and libc.a. This is the default for
powerpc-*-eabisim configurations.</p>

<p>-mmvme On embedded PowerPC systems, assume that the
startup module is called crt0.o and the standard C libraries
are libmvme.a and libc.a.</p>

<p>-mads On embedded PowerPC systems, assume that the
startup module is called crt0.o and the standard C libraries
are libads.a and libc.a.</p>

<p>-myellowknife On embedded PowerPC systems, assume that
the startup module is called crt0.o and the standard C
libraries are libyk.a and libc.a.</p>

<p>-mvxworks On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems,
specify that you are compiling for a VxWorks system.</p>

<p>-memb On embedded PowerPC systems, set the PPC_EMB bit
in the ELF flags header to indicate that eabi extended
relocations are used.</p>

<p>-meabi -mno-eabi On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC
systems do (do not) adhere to the Embedded Applications
Binary Interface (eabi) which is a set of modifications to
the System V.4 specifications. Selecting -meabi means that
the stack is aligned to an 8 byte boundary, a function
&quot;__eabi&quot; is called to from &quot;main&quot; to set
up the eabi environment, and the -msdata option can use both
&quot;r2&quot; and &quot;r13&quot; to point to two separate
small data areas. Selecting -mno-eabi means that the stack
is aligned to a 16 byte boundary, do not call an
initialization function from &quot;main&quot;, and the
-msdata option will only use &quot;r13&quot; to point to a
single small data area. The -meabi option is on by default
if you configured GCC using one of the powerpc*-*-eabi*
options.</p>

<p>-msdata=eabi On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems,
put small initialized &quot;const&quot; global and static
data in the .sdata2 section, which is pointed to by register
&quot;r2&quot;. Put small initialized non-&quot;const&quot;
global and static data in the .sdata section, which is
pointed to by register &quot;r13&quot;. Put small
uninitialized global and static data in the .sbss section,
which is adjacent to the .sdata section. The -msdata=eabi
option is incompatible with the -mrelocatable option. The
-msdata=eabi option also sets the -memb option.</p>

<p>-msdata=sysv On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems,
put small global and static data in the .sdata section,
which is pointed to by register &quot;r13&quot;. Put small
uninitialized global and static data in the .sbss section,
which is adjacent to the .sdata section. The -msdata=sysv
option is incompatible with the -mrelocatable option.</p>

<p>-msdata=default -msdata On System V.4 and embedded
PowerPC systems, if -meabi is used, compile code the same as
-msdata=eabi, otherwise compile code the same as
-msdata=sysv.</p>

<p>-msdata=data On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems,
put small global data in the .sdata section. Put small
uninitialized global data in the .sbss section. Do not use
register &quot;r13&quot; to address small data however. This
is the default behavior unless other -msdata options are
used.</p>

<p>-msdata=none -mno-sdata On embedded PowerPC systems, put
all initialized global and static data in the .data section,
and all uninitialized data in the .bss section.</p>

<p>-G num On embedded PowerPC systems, put global and
static items less than or equal to num bytes into the small
data or bss sections instead of the normal data or bss
section. By default, num is 8. The -G num switch is also
passed to the linker. All modules should be compiled with
the same -G num value.</p>

<p>-mregnames -mno-regnames On System V.4 and embedded
PowerPC systems do (do not) emit register names in the
assembly language output using symbolic forms.</p>

<p>-mlongcall -mno-longcall By default assume that all
calls are far away so that a longer more expensive calling
sequence is required. This is required for calls further
than 32 megabytes (33,554,432 bytes) from the current
location. A short call will be generated if the compiler
knows the call cannot be that far away. This setting can be
overridden by the &quot;shortcall&quot; function attribute,
or by &quot;#pragma longcall(0)&quot;.</p>

<p>Some linkers are capable of detecting out-of-range calls
and generating glue code on the fly. On these systems, long
calls are unnecessary and generate slower code. As of this
writing, the AIX linker can do this, as can the GNU linker
for PowerPC/64. It is planned to add this feature to the GNU
linker for 32-bit PowerPC systems as well.</p>

<p>On Darwin/PPC systems, &quot;#pragma longcall&quot; will
generate &quot;jbsr callee, L42&quot;, plus a &quot;branch
island&quot; (glue code). The two target addresses represent
the callee and the &quot;branch island&quot;. The Darwin/PPC
linker will prefer the first address and generate a &quot;bl
callee&quot; if the PPC &quot;bl&quot; instruction will
reach the callee directly; otherwise, the linker will
generate &quot;bl L42&quot; to call the &quot;branch
island&quot;. The &quot;branch island&quot; is appended to
the body of the calling function; it computes the full
32-bit address of the callee and jumps to it.</p>

<p>On Mach-O (Darwin) systems, this option directs the
compiler emit to the glue for every direct call, and the
Darwin linker decides whether to use or discard it.</p>

<p>In the future, we may cause GCC to ignore all longcall
specifications when the linker is known to generate
glue.</p>

<p>-pthread Adds support for multithreading with the
pthreads library. This option sets flags for both the
preprocessor and linker.</p>

<p>S/390 and zSeries Options These are the -m options
defined for the S/390 and zSeries architecture.</p>

<p>-mhard-float -msoft-float Use (do not use) the hardware
floating-point instructions and registers for floating-point
operations. When -msoft-float is specified, functions in
libgcc.a will be used to perform floating- point operations.
When -mhard-float is specified, the compiler generates IEEE
floating-point instructions. This is the default.</p>

<p>-mhard-dfp -mno-hard-dfp Use (do not use) the hardware
decimal-floating-point instructions for
decimal-floating-point operations. When -mno-hard-dfp is
specified, functions in libgcc.a will be used to perform
decimal- floating-point operations. When -mhard-dfp is
specified, the compiler generates decimal-floating-point
hardware instructions. This is the default for -march=z9-ec
or higher.</p>

<p>-mlong-double-64 -mlong-double-128 These switches
control the size of &quot;long double&quot; type. A size of
64bit makes the &quot;long double&quot; type equivalent to
the &quot;double&quot; type. This is the default.</p>

<p>-mbackchain -mno-backchain Store (do not store) the
address of the callers frame as backchain pointer into the
callees stack frame. A backchain may be needed to allow
debugging using tools that do not understand DWARF-2 call
frame information. When -mno-packed-stack is in effect, the
backchain pointer is stored at the bottom of the stack
frame; when -mpacked-stack is in effect, the backchain is
placed into the topmost word of the 96/160 byte register
save area.</p>

<p>In general, code compiled with -mbackchain is
call-compatible with code compiled with -mmo-backchain;
however, use of the backchain for debugging purposes usually
requires that the whole binary is built with -mbackchain.
Note that the combination of -mbackchain, -mpacked-stack and
-mhard-float is not supported. In order to build a linux
kernel use -msoft-float.</p>

<p>The default is to not maintain the backchain.</p>

<p>-mpacked-stack -mno-packed-stack Use (do not use) the
packed stack layout. When -mno-packed-stack is specified,
the compiler uses the all fields of the 96/160 byte register
save area only for their default purpose; unused fields
still take up stack space. When -mpacked-stack is specified,
register save slots are densely packed at the top of the
register save area; unused space is reused for other
purposes, allowing for more efficient use of the available
stack space. However, when -mbackchain is also in effect,
the topmost word of the save area is always used to store
the backchain, and the return address register is always
saved two words below the backchain.</p>

<p>As long as the stack frame backchain is not used, code
generated with -mpacked-stack is call-compatible with code
generated with -mno-packed-stack. Note that some non-FSF
releases of GCC 2.95 for S/390 or zSeries generated code
that uses the stack frame backchain at run time, not just
for debugging purposes. Such code is not call-compatible
with code compiled with -mpacked-stack. Also, note that the
combination of -mbackchain, -mpacked-stack and -mhard-float
is not supported. In order to build a linux kernel use
-msoft-float.</p>

<p>The default is to not use the packed stack layout.</p>

<p>-msmall-exec -mno-small-exec Generate (or do not
generate) code using the &quot;bras&quot; instruction to do
subroutine calls. This only works reliably if the total
executable size does not exceed 64k. The default is to use
the &quot;basr&quot; instruction instead, which does not
have this limitation.</p>

<p>-m64 -m31 When -m31 is specified, generate code
compliant to the GNU/Linux for S/390 ABI. When -m64 is
specified, generate code compliant to the GNU/Linux for
zSeries ABI. This allows GCC in particular to generate
64-bit instructions. For the s390 targets, the default is
-m31, while the s390x targets default to -m64.</p>

<p>-mzarch -mesa When -mzarch is specified, generate code
using the instructions available on z/Architecture. When
-mesa is specified, generate code using the instructions
available on ESA/390. Note that -mesa is not possible with
-m64. When generating code compliant to the GNU/Linux for
S/390 ABI, the default is -mesa. When generating code
compliant to the GNU/Linux for zSeries ABI, the default is
-mzarch.</p>

<p>-mmvcle -mno-mvcle Generate (or do not generate) code
using the &quot;mvcle&quot; instruction to perform block
moves. When -mno-mvcle is specified, use a &quot;mvc&quot;
loop instead. This is the default unless optimizing for
size.</p>

<p>-mdebug -mno-debug Print (or do not print) additional
debug information when compiling. The default is to not
print debug information.</p>

<p>-march=cpu-type Generate code that will run on cpu-type,
which is the name of a system representing a certain
processor type. Possible values for cpu-type are g5, g6,
z900, z990, z9-109, z9-ec and z10. When generating code
using the instructions available on z/Architecture, the
default is -march=z900. Otherwise, the default is
-march=g5.</p>

<p>-mtune=cpu-type Tune to cpu-type everything applicable
about the generated code, except for the ABI and the set of
available instructions. The list of cpu-type values is the
same as for -march. The default is the value used for
-march.</p>

<p>-mtpf-trace -mno-tpf-trace Generate code that adds (does
not add) in TPF OS specific branches to trace routines in
the operating system. This option is off by default, even
when compiling for the TPF OS.</p>

<p>-mfused-madd -mno-fused-madd Generate code that uses
(does not use) the floating point multiply and accumulate
instructions. These instructions are generated by default if
hardware floating point is used.</p>

<p>-mwarn-framesize=framesize Emit a warning if the current
function exceeds the given frame size. Because this is a
compile time check it doesnt need to be a real problem when
the program runs. It is intended to identify functions which
most probably cause a stack overflow. It is useful to be
used in an environment with limited stack size e.g. the
linux kernel.</p>

<p>-mwarn-dynamicstack Emit a warning if the function calls
alloca or uses dynamically sized arrays. This is generally a
bad idea with a limited stack size.</p>

<p>-mstack-guard=stack-guard -mstack-size=stack-size If
these options are provided the s390 back end emits
additional instructions in the function prologue which
trigger a trap if the stack size is stack-guard bytes above
the stack-size (remember that the stack on s390 grows
downward). If the stack-guard option is omitted the smallest
power of 2 larger than the frame size of the compiled
function is chosen. These options are intended to be used to
help debugging stack overflow problems. The additionally
emitted code causes only little overhead and hence can also
be used in production like systems without greater
performance degradation. The given values have to be exact
powers of 2 and stack-size has to be greater than
stack-guard without exceeding 64k. In order to be efficient
the extra code makes the assumption that the stack starts at
an address aligned to the value given by stack-size. The
stack- guard option can only be used in conjunction with
stack-size.</p>

<p>Score Options These options are defined for Score
implementations:</p>

<p>-meb Compile code for big endian mode. This is the
default.</p>

<p>-mel Compile code for little endian mode.</p>

<p>-mnhwloop Disable generate bcnz instruction.</p>

<p>-muls Enable generate unaligned load and store
instruction.</p>

<p>-mmac Enable the use of multiply-accumulate
instructions. Disabled by default.</p>

<p>-mscore5 Specify the SCORE5 as the target
architecture.</p>

<p>-mscore5u Specify the SCORE5U of the target
architecture.</p>

<p>-mscore7 Specify the SCORE7 as the target architecture.
This is the default.</p>

<p>-mscore7d Specify the SCORE7D as the target
architecture.</p>

<p>SH Options These -m options are defined for the SH
implementations:</p>

<p>-m1 Generate code for the SH1.</p>

<p>-m2 Generate code for the SH2.</p>

<p>-m2e Generate code for the SH2e.</p>

<p>-m3 Generate code for the SH3.</p>

<p>-m3e Generate code for the SH3e.</p>

<p>-m4-nofpu Generate code for the SH4 without a
floating-point unit.</p>

<p>-m4-single-only Generate code for the SH4 with a
floating-point unit that only supports single-precision
arithmetic.</p>

<p>-m4-single Generate code for the SH4 assuming the
floating-point unit is in single-precision mode by
default.</p>

<p>-m4 Generate code for the SH4.</p>

<p>-m4a-nofpu Generate code for the SH4al-dsp, or for a
SH4a in such a way that the floating-point unit is not
used.</p>

<p>-m4a-single-only Generate code for the SH4a, in such a
way that no double-precision floating point operations are
used.</p>

<p>-m4a-single Generate code for the SH4a assuming the
floating-point unit is in single-precision mode by
default.</p>

<p>-m4a Generate code for the SH4a.</p>

<p>-m4al Same as -m4a-nofpu, except that it implicitly
passes -dsp to the assembler. GCC doesnt generate any DSP
instructions at the moment.</p>

<p>-mb Compile code for the processor in big endian
mode.</p>

<p>-ml Compile code for the processor in little endian
mode.</p>

<p>-mdalign Align doubles at 64-bit boundaries. Note that
this changes the calling conventions, and thus some
functions from the standard C library will not work unless
you recompile it first with -mdalign.</p>

<p>-mrelax Shorten some address references at link time,
when possible; uses the linker option -relax.</p>

<p>-mbigtable Use 32-bit offsets in &quot;switch&quot;
tables. The default is to use 16-bit offsets.</p>

<p>-mbitops Enable the use of bit manipulation instructions
on SH2A.</p>

<p>-mfmovd Enable the use of the instruction
&quot;fmovd&quot;.</p>

<p>-mhitachi Comply with the calling conventions defined by
Renesas.</p>

<p>-mrenesas Comply with the calling conventions defined by
Renesas.</p>

<p>-mno-renesas Comply with the calling conventions defined
for GCC before the Renesas conventions were available. This
option is the default for all targets of the SH toolchain
except for sh-symbianelf.</p>

<p>-mnomacsave Mark the &quot;MAC&quot; register as
call-clobbered, even if -mhitachi is given.</p>

<p>-mieee Increase IEEE-compliance of floating-point code.
At the moment, this is equivalent to -fno-finite-math-only.
When generating 16 bit SH opcodes, getting IEEE-conforming
results for comparisons of NANs / infinities incurs extra
overhead in every floating point comparison, therefore the
default is set to -ffinite-math-only.</p>

<p>-minline-ic_invalidate Inline code to invalidate
instruction cache entries after setting up nested function
trampolines. This option has no effect if -musermode is in
effect and the selected code generation option (e.g. -m4)
does not allow the use of the icbi instruction. If the
selected code generation option does not allow the use of
the icbi instruction, and -musermode is not in effect, the
inlined code will manipulate the instruction cache address
array directly with an associative write. This not only
requires privileged mode, but it will also fail if the cache
line had been mapped via the TLB and has become
unmapped.</p>

<p>-misize Dump instruction size and location in the
assembly code.</p>

<p>-mpadstruct This option is deprecated. It pads
structures to multiple of 4 bytes, which is incompatible
with the SH ABI.</p>

<p>-mspace Optimize for space instead of speed. Implied by
-Os.</p>

<p>-mprefergot When generating position-independent code,
emit function calls using the Global Offset Table instead of
the Procedure Linkage Table.</p>

<p>-musermode Dont generate privileged mode only code;
implies -mno-inline-ic_invalidate if the inlined code would
not work in user mode. This is the default when the target
is &quot;sh-*-linux*&quot;.</p>

<p>-multcost=number Set the cost to assume for a multiply
insn.</p>

<p>-mdiv=strategy Set the division strategy to use for
SHmedia code. strategy must be one of: call, call2, fp, inv,
inv:minlat, inv20u, inv20l, inv:call, inv:call2, inv:fp .
&quot;fp&quot; performs the operation in floating point.
This has a very high latency, but needs only a few
instructions, so it might be a good choice if your code has
enough easily exploitable ILP to allow the compiler to
schedule the floating point instructions together with other
instructions. Division by zero causes a floating point
exception. &quot;inv&quot; uses integer operations to
calculate the inverse of the divisor, and then multiplies
the dividend with the inverse. This strategy allows cse and
hoisting of the inverse calculation. Division by zero
calculates an unspecified result, but does not trap.
&quot;inv:minlat&quot; is a variant of &quot;inv&quot; where
if no cse / hoisting opportunities have been found, or if
the entire operation has been hoisted to the same place, the
last stages of the inverse calculation are intertwined with
the final multiply to reduce the overall latency, at the
expense of using a few more instructions, and thus offering
fewer scheduling opportunities with other code.
&quot;call&quot; calls a library function that usually
implements the inv:minlat strategy. This gives high code
density for m5-*media-nofpu compilations. &quot;call2&quot;
uses a different entry point of the same library function,
where it assumes that a pointer to a lookup table has
already been set up, which exposes the pointer load to cse /
code hoisting optimizations. &quot;inv:call&quot;,
&quot;inv:call2&quot; and &quot;inv:fp&quot; all use the
&quot;inv&quot; algorithm for initial code generation, but
if the code stays unoptimized, revert to the
&quot;call&quot;, &quot;call2&quot;, or &quot;fp&quot;
strategies, respectively. Note that the potentially-trapping
side effect of division by zero is carried by a separate
instruction, so it is possible that all the integer
instructions are hoisted out, but the marker for the side
effect stays where it is. A recombination to fp operations
or a call is not possible in that case. &quot;inv20u&quot;
and &quot;inv20l&quot; are variants of the
&quot;inv:minlat&quot; strategy. In the case that the
inverse calculation was nor separated from the multiply,
they speed up division where the dividend fits into 20 bits
(plus sign where applicable), by inserting a test to skip a
number of operations in this case; this test slows down the
case of larger dividends. inv20u assumes the case of a such
a small dividend to be unlikely, and inv20l assumes it to be
likely.</p>

<p>-mdivsi3_libfunc=name Set the name of the library
function used for 32 bit signed division to name. This only
affect the name used in the call and inv:call division
strategies, and the compiler will still expect the same sets
of input/output/clobbered registers as if this option was
not present.</p>

<p>-mfixed-range=register-range Generate code treating the
given register range as fixed registers. A fixed register is
one that the register allocator can not use. This is useful
when compiling kernel code. A register range is specified as
two registers separated by a dash. Multiple register ranges
can be specified separated by a comma.</p>

<p>-madjust-unroll Throttle unrolling to avoid thrashing
target registers. This option only has an effect if the gcc
code base supports the TARGET_ADJUST_UNROLL_MAX target
hook.</p>

<p>-mindexed-addressing Enable the use of the indexed
addressing mode for SHmedia32/SHcompact. This is only safe
if the hardware and/or OS implement 32 bit wrap-around
semantics for the indexed addressing mode. The architecture
allows the implementation of processors with 64 bit MMU,
which the OS could use to get 32 bit addressing, but since
no current hardware implementation supports this or any
other way to make the indexed addressing mode safe to use in
the 32 bit ABI, the default is -mno-indexed-addressing.</p>

<p>-mgettrcost=number Set the cost assumed for the gettr
instruction to number. The default is 2 if -mpt-fixed is in
effect, 100 otherwise.</p>

<p>-mpt-fixed Assume pt* instructions won t trap. This will
generally generate better scheduled code, but is unsafe on
current hardware. The current architecture definition says
that ptabs and ptrel trap when the target anded with 3 is 3.
This has the unintentional effect of making it unsafe to
schedule ptabs / ptrel before a branch, or hoist it out of a
loop. For example, __do_global_ctors, a part of libgcc that
runs constructors at program startup, calls functions in a
list which is delimited by -1. With the -mpt-fixed option,
the ptabs will be done before testing against -1. That means
that all the constructors will be run a bit quicker, but
when the loop comes to the end of the list, the program
crashes because ptabs loads -1 into a target register. Since
this option is unsafe for any hardware implementing the
current architecture specification, the default is
-mno-pt-fixed. Unless the user specifies a specific cost
with -mgettrcost, -mno-pt-fixed also implies
-mgettrcost=100; this deters register allocation using
target registers for storing ordinary integers.</p>

<p>-minvalid-symbols Assume symbols might be invalid.
Ordinary function symbols generated by the compiler will
always be valid to load with movi/shori/ptabs or
movi/shori/ptrel, but with assembler and/or linker tricks it
is possible to generate symbols that will cause ptabs /
ptrel to trap. This option is only meaningful when
-mno-pt-fixed is in effect. It will then prevent
cross-basic-block cse, hoisting and most scheduling of
symbol loads. The default is -mno-invalid-symbols.</p>

<p>SPARC Options These -m options are supported on the
SPARC:</p>

<p>-mno-app-regs -mapp-regs Specify -mapp-regs to generate
output using the global registers 2 through 4, which the
SPARC SVR4 ABI reserves for applications. This is the
default.</p>

<p>To be fully SVR4 ABI compliant at the cost of some
performance loss, specify -mno-app-regs. You should compile
libraries and system software with this option.</p>

<p>-mfpu -mhard-float Generate output containing floating
point instructions. This is the default.</p>

<p>-mno-fpu -msoft-float Generate output containing library
calls for floating point. Warning: the requisite libraries
are not available for all SPARC targets. Normally the
facilities of the machines usual C compiler are used, but
this cannot be done directly in cross-compilation. You must
make your own arrangements to provide suitable library
functions for cross-compilation. The embedded targets
sparc-*-aout and sparclite-*-* do provide software floating
point support.</p>

<p>-msoft-float changes the calling convention in the
output file; therefore, it is only useful if you compile all
of a program with this option. In particular, you need to
compile libgcc.a, the library that comes with GCC, with
-msoft-float in order for this to work.</p>

<p>-mhard-quad-float Generate output containing quad-word
(long double) floating point instructions.</p>

<p>-msoft-quad-float Generate output containing library
calls for quad-word (long double) floating point
instructions. The functions called are those specified in
the SPARC ABI. This is the default.</p>

<p>As of this writing, there are no SPARC implementations
that have hardware support for the quad-word floating point
instructions. They all invoke a trap handler for one of
these instructions, and then the trap handler emulates the
effect of the instruction. Because of the trap handler
overhead, this is much slower than calling the ABI library
routines. Thus the -msoft-quad-float option is the
default.</p>

<p>-mno-unaligned-doubles -munaligned-doubles Assume that
doubles have 8 byte alignment. This is the default.</p>

<p>With -munaligned-doubles, GCC assumes that doubles have
8 byte alignment only if they are contained in another type,
or if they have an absolute address. Otherwise, it assumes
they have 4 byte alignment. Specifying this option avoids
some rare compatibility problems with code generated by
other compilers. It is not the default because it results in
a performance loss, especially for floating point code.</p>

<p>-mno-faster-structs -mfaster-structs With
-mfaster-structs, the compiler assumes that structures
should have 8 byte alignment. This enables the use of pairs
of &quot;ldd&quot; and &quot;std&quot; instructions for
copies in structure assignment, in place of twice as many
&quot;ld&quot; and &quot;st&quot; pairs. However, the use of
this changed alignment directly violates the SPARC ABI.
Thus, its intended only for use on targets where the
developer acknowledges that their resulting code will not be
directly in line with the rules of the ABI.</p>

<p>-mimpure-text -mimpure-text, used in addition to
-shared, tells the compiler to not pass -z text to the
linker when linking a shared object. Using this option, you
can link position-dependent code into a shared object.</p>

<p>-mimpure-text suppresses the &quot;relocations remain
against allocatable but non-writable sections&quot; linker
error message. However, the necessary relocations will
trigger copy-on-write, and the shared object is not actually
shared across processes. Instead of using -mimpure-text, you
should compile all source code with -fpic or -fPIC.</p>

<p>This option is only available on SunOS and Solaris.</p>

<p>-mcpu=cpu_type Set the instruction set, register set,
and instruction scheduling parameters for machine type
cpu_type. Supported values for cpu_type are v7, cypress, v8,
supersparc, sparclite, f930, f934, hypersparc, sparclite86x,
sparclet, tsc701, v9, ultrasparc, ultrasparc3, niagara and
niagara2.</p>

<p>Default instruction scheduling parameters are used for
values that select an architecture and not an
implementation. These are v7, v8, sparclite, sparclet,
v9.</p>

<p>Here is a list of each supported architecture and their
supported implementations.</p>

<p>v7: cypress v8: supersparc, hypersparc sparclite: f930,
f934, sparclite86x sparclet: tsc701 v9: ultrasparc,
ultrasparc3, niagara, niagara2</p>

<p>By default (unless configured otherwise), GCC generates
code for the V7 variant of the SPARC architecture. With
-mcpu=cypress, the compiler additionally optimizes it for
the Cypress CY7C602 chip, as used in the
SPARCStation/SPARCServer 3xx series. This is also
appropriate for the older SPARCStation 1, 2, IPX etc.</p>

<p>With -mcpu=v8, GCC generates code for the V8 variant of
the SPARC architecture. The only difference from V7 code is
that the compiler emits the integer multiply and integer
divide instructions which exist in SPARC-V8 but not in
SPARC-V7. With -mcpu=supersparc, the compiler additionally
optimizes it for the SuperSPARC chip, as used in the
SPARCStation 10, 1000 and 2000 series.</p>

<p>With -mcpu=sparclite, GCC generates code for the
SPARClite variant of the SPARC architecture. This adds the
integer multiply, integer divide step and scan
(&quot;ffs&quot;) instructions which exist in SPARClite but
not in SPARC-V7. With -mcpu=f930, the compiler additionally
optimizes it for the Fujitsu MB86930 chip, which is the
original SPARClite, with no FPU. With -mcpu=f934, the
compiler additionally optimizes it for the Fujitsu MB86934
chip, which is the more recent SPARClite with FPU.</p>

<p>With -mcpu=sparclet, GCC generates code for the SPARClet
variant of the SPARC architecture. This adds the integer
multiply, multiply/accumulate, integer divide step and scan
(&quot;ffs&quot;) instructions which exist in SPARClet but
not in SPARC-V7. With -mcpu=tsc701, the compiler
additionally optimizes it for the TEMIC SPARClet chip.</p>

<p>With -mcpu=v9, GCC generates code for the V9 variant of
the SPARC architecture. This adds 64-bit integer and
floating-point move instructions, 3 additional
floating-point condition code registers and conditional move
instructions. With -mcpu=ultrasparc, the compiler
additionally optimizes it for the Sun UltraSPARC I/II/IIi
chips. With -mcpu=ultrasparc3, the compiler additionally
optimizes it for the Sun UltraSPARC
III/III+/IIIi/IIIi+/IV/IV+ chips. With -mcpu=niagara, the
compiler additionally optimizes it for Sun UltraSPARC T1
chips. With -mcpu=niagara2, the compiler additionally
optimizes it for Sun UltraSPARC T2 chips.</p>

<p>-mtune=cpu_type Set the instruction scheduling
parameters for machine type cpu_type, but do not set the
instruction set or register set that the option
-mcpu=cpu_type would.</p>

<p>The same values for -mcpu=cpu_type can be used for
-mtune=cpu_type, but the only useful values are those that
select a particular cpu implementation. Those are cypress,
supersparc, hypersparc, f930, f934, sparclite86x, tsc701,
ultrasparc, ultrasparc3, niagara, and niagara2.</p>

<p>-mv8plus -mno-v8plus With -mv8plus, GCC generates code
for the SPARC-V8+ ABI. The difference from the V8 ABI is
that the global and out registers are considered 64-bit
wide. This is enabled by default on Solaris in 32-bit mode
for all SPARC-V9 processors.</p>

<p>-mvis -mno-vis With -mvis, GCC generates code that takes
advantage of the UltraSPARC Visual Instruction Set
extensions. The default is -mno-vis.</p>

<p>These -m options are supported in addition to the above
on SPARC-V9 processors in 64-bit environments:</p>

<p>-mlittle-endian Generate code for a processor running in
little-endian mode. It is only available for a few
configurations and most notably not on Solaris and
Linux.</p>

<p>-m32 -m64 Generate code for a 32-bit or 64-bit
environment. The 32-bit environment sets int, long and
pointer to 32 bits. The 64-bit environment sets int to 32
bits and long and pointer to 64 bits.</p>

<p>-mcmodel=medlow Generate code for the Medium/Low code
model: 64-bit addresses, programs must be linked in the low
32 bits of memory. Programs can be statically or dynamically
linked.</p>

<p>-mcmodel=medmid Generate code for the Medium/Middle code
model: 64-bit addresses, programs must be linked in the low
44 bits of memory, the text and data segments must be less
than 2GB in size and the data segment must be located within
2GB of the text segment.</p>

<p>-mcmodel=medany Generate code for the Medium/Anywhere
code model: 64-bit addresses, programs may be linked
anywhere in memory, the text and data segments must be less
than 2GB in size and the data segment must be located within
2GB of the text segment.</p>

<p>-mcmodel=embmedany Generate code for the Medium/Anywhere
code model for embedded systems: 64-bit addresses, the text
and data segments must be less than 2GB in size, both
starting anywhere in memory (determined at link time). The
global register %g4 points to the base of the data segment.
Programs are statically linked and PIC is not supported.</p>

<p>-mstack-bias -mno-stack-bias With -mstack-bias, GCC
assumes that the stack pointer, and frame pointer if
present, are offset by -2047 which must be added back when
making stack frame references. This is the default in 64-bit
mode. Otherwise, assume no such offset is present.</p>

<p>These switches are supported in addition to the above on
Solaris:</p>

<p>-threads Add support for multithreading using the
Solaris threads library. This option sets flags for both the
preprocessor and linker. This option does not affect the
thread safety of object code produced by the compiler or
that of libraries supplied with it.</p>

<p>-pthreads Add support for multithreading using the POSIX
threads library. This option sets flags for both the
preprocessor and linker. This option does not affect the
thread safety of object code produced by the compiler or
that of libraries supplied with it.</p>

<p>-pthread This is a synonym for -pthreads.</p>

<p>SPU Options These -m options are supported on the
SPU:</p>

<p>-mwarn-reloc -merror-reloc The loader for SPU does not
handle dynamic relocations. By default, GCC will give an
error when it generates code that requires a dynamic
relocation. -mno-error-reloc disables the error,
-mwarn-reloc will generate a warning instead.</p>

<p>-msafe-dma -munsafe-dma Instructions which initiate or
test completion of DMA must not be reordered with respect to
loads and stores of the memory which is being accessed.
Users typically address this problem using the volatile
keyword, but that can lead to inefficient code in places
where the memory is known to not change. Rather than mark
the memory as volatile we treat the DMA instructions as
potentially effecting all memory. With -munsafe-dma users
must use the volatile keyword to protect memory
accesses.</p>

<p>-mbranch-hints By default, GCC will generate a branch
hint instruction to avoid pipeline stalls for always taken
or probably taken branches. A hint will not be generated
closer than 8 instructions away from its branch. There is
little reason to disable them, except for debugging
purposes, or to make an object a little bit smaller.</p>

<p>-msmall-mem -mlarge-mem By default, GCC generates code
assuming that addresses are never larger than 18 bits. With
-mlarge-mem code is generated that assumes a full 32 bit
address.</p>

<p>-mstdmain By default, GCC links against startup code
that assumes the SPU- style main function interface (which
has an unconventional parameter list). With -mstdmain, GCC
will link your program against startup code that assumes a
C99-style interface to &quot;main&quot;, including a local
copy of &quot;argv&quot; strings.</p>

<p>-mfixed-range=register-range Generate code treating the
given register range as fixed registers. A fixed register is
one that the register allocator can not use. This is useful
when compiling kernel code. A register range is specified as
two registers separated by a dash. Multiple register ranges
can be specified separated by a comma.</p>

<p>-mdual-nops -mdual-nops=n By default, GCC will insert
nops to increase dual issue when it expects it to increase
performance. n can be a value from 0 to 10. A smaller n will
insert fewer nops. 10 is the default, 0 is the same as
-mno-dual-nops. Disabled with -Os.</p>

<p>-mhint-max-nops=n Maximum number of nops to insert for a
branch hint. A branch hint must be at least 8 instructions
away from the branch it is effecting. GCC will insert up to
n nops to enforce this, otherwise it will not generate the
branch hint.</p>

<p>-mhint-max-distance=n The encoding of the branch hint
instruction limits the hint to be within 256 instructions of
the branch it is effecting. By default, GCC makes sure it is
within 125.</p>

<p>-msafe-hints Work around a hardware bug which causes the
SPU to stall indefinitely. By default, GCC will insert the
&quot;hbrp&quot; instruction to make sure this stall wont
happen.</p>

<p>Options for System V These additional options are
available on System V Release 4 for compatibility with other
compilers on those systems:</p>

<p>-G Create a shared object. It is recommended that
-symbolic or -shared be used instead.</p>

<p>-Qy Identify the versions of each tool used by the
compiler, in a &quot;.ident&quot; assembler directive in the
output.</p>

<p>-Qn Refrain from adding &quot;.ident&quot; directives to
the output file (this is the default).</p>

<p>-YP,dirs Search the directories dirs, and no others, for
libraries specified with -l.</p>

<p>-Ym,dir Look in the directory dir to find the M4
preprocessor. The assembler uses this option.</p>

<p>V850 Options These -m options are defined for V850
implementations:</p>

<p>-mlong-calls -mno-long-calls Treat all calls as being
far away (near). If calls are assumed to be far away, the
compiler will always load the functions address up into a
register, and call indirect through the pointer.</p>

<p>-mno-ep -mep Do not optimize (do optimize) basic blocks
that use the same index pointer 4 or more times to copy
pointer into the &quot;ep&quot; register, and use the
shorter &quot;sld&quot; and &quot;sst&quot; instructions.
The -mep option is on by default if you optimize.</p>

<p>-mno-prolog-function -mprolog-function Do not use (do
use) external functions to save and restore registers at the
prologue and epilogue of a function. The external functions
are slower, but use less code space if more than one
function saves the same number of registers. The
-mprolog-function option is on by default if you
optimize.</p>

<p>-mspace Try to make the code as small as possible. At
present, this just turns on the -mep and -mprolog-function
options.</p>

<p>-mtda=n Put static or global variables whose size is n
bytes or less into the tiny data area that register
&quot;ep&quot; points to. The tiny data area can hold up to
256 bytes in total (128 bytes for byte references).</p>

<p>-msda=n Put static or global variables whose size is n
bytes or less into the small data area that register
&quot;gp&quot; points to. The small data area can hold up to
64 kilobytes.</p>

<p>-mzda=n Put static or global variables whose size is n
bytes or less into the first 32 kilobytes of memory.</p>

<p>-mv850 Specify that the target processor is the
V850.</p>

<p>-mbig-switch Generate code suitable for big switch
tables. Use this option only if the assembler/linker
complain about out of range branches within a switch
table.</p>

<p>-mapp-regs This option will cause r2 and r5 to be used
in the code generated by the compiler. This setting is the
default.</p>

<p>-mno-app-regs This option will cause r2 and r5 to be
treated as fixed registers.</p>

<p>-mv850e1 Specify that the target processor is the
V850E1. The preprocessor constants __v850e1__ and __v850e__
will be defined if this option is used.</p>

<p>-mv850e Specify that the target processor is the V850E.
The preprocessor constant __v850e__ will be defined if this
option is used.</p>

<p>If neither -mv850 nor -mv850e nor -mv850e1 are defined
then a default target processor will be chosen and the
relevant __v850*__ preprocessor constant will be
defined.</p>

<p>The preprocessor constants __v850 and __v851__ are
always defined, regardless of which processor variant is the
target.</p>

<p>-mdisable-callt This option will suppress generation of
the CALLT instruction for the v850e and v850e1 flavors of
the v850 architecture. The default is -mno-disable-callt
which allows the CALLT instruction to be used.</p>

<p>VAX Options These -m options are defined for the
VAX:</p>

<p>-munix Do not output certain jump instructions
(&quot;aobleq&quot; and so on) that the Unix assembler for
the VAX cannot handle across long ranges.</p>

<p>-mgnu Do output those jump instructions, on the
assumption that you will assemble with the GNU
assembler.</p>

<p>-mg Output code for g-format floating point numbers
instead of d-format.</p>

<p>VxWorks Options The options in this section are defined
for all VxWorks targets. Options specific to the target
hardware are listed with the other options for that
target.</p>

<p>-mrtp GCC can generate code for both VxWorks kernels and
real time processes (RTPs). This option switches from the
former to the latter. It also defines the preprocessor macro
&quot;__RTP__&quot;.</p>

<p>-non-static Link an RTP executable against shared
libraries rather than static libraries. The options -static
and -shared can also be used for RTPs; -static is the
default.</p>

<p>-Bstatic -Bdynamic These options are passed down to the
linker. They are defined for compatibility with Diab.</p>

<p>-Xbind-lazy Enable lazy binding of function calls. This
option is equivalent to -Wl,-z,now and is defined for
compatibility with Diab.</p>

<p>-Xbind-now Disable lazy binding of function calls. This
option is the default and is defined for compatibility with
Diab.</p>

<p>x86-64 Options These are listed under</p>

<p>i386 and x86-64 Windows Options These additional options
are available for Windows targets:</p>

<p>-mconsole This option is available for Cygwin and MinGW
targets. It specifies that a console application is to be
generated, by instructing the linker to set the PE header
subsystem type required for console applications. This is
the default behaviour for Cygwin and MinGW targets.</p>

<p>-mcygwin This option is available for Cygwin targets. It
specifies that the Cygwin internal interface is to be used
for predefined preprocessor macros, C runtime libraries and
related linker paths and options. For Cygwin targets this is
the default behaviour. This option is deprecated and will be
removed in a future release.</p>

<p>-mno-cygwin This option is available for Cygwin targets.
It specifies that the MinGW internal interface is to be used
instead of Cygwins, by setting MinGW-related predefined
macros and linker paths and default library options. This
option is deprecated and will be removed in a future
release.</p>

<p>-mdll This option is available for Cygwin and MinGW
targets. It specifies that a DLL - a dynamic link library -
is to be generated, enabling the selection of the required
runtime startup object and entry point.</p>

<p>-mnop-fun-dllimport This option is available for Cygwin
and MinGW targets. It specifies that the dllimport attribute
should be ignored.</p>

<p>-mthread This option is available for MinGW targets. It
specifies that MinGW-specific thread support is to be
used.</p>

<p>-mwin32 This option is available for Cygwin and MinGW
targets. It specifies that the typical Windows pre-defined
macros are to be set in the pre-processor, but does not
influence the choice of runtime library/startup code.</p>

<p>-mwindows This option is available for Cygwin and MinGW
targets. It specifies that a GUI application is to be
generated by instructing the linker to set the PE header
subsystem type appropriately.</p>

<p>See also under i386 and x86-64 Options for standard
options.</p>

<p>Xstormy16 Options These options are defined for
Xstormy16:</p>

<p>-msim Choose startup files and linker script suitable
for the simulator.</p>

<p>Xtensa Options These options are supported for Xtensa
targets:</p>

<p>-mconst16 -mno-const16 Enable or disable use of
&quot;CONST16&quot; instructions for loading constant
values. The &quot;CONST16&quot; instruction is currently not
a standard option from Tensilica. When enabled,
&quot;CONST16&quot; instructions are always used in place of
the standard &quot;L32R&quot; instructions. The use of
&quot;CONST16&quot; is enabled by default only if the
&quot;L32R&quot; instruction is not available.</p>

<p>-mfused-madd -mno-fused-madd Enable or disable use of
fused multiply/add and multiply/subtract instructions in the
floating-point option. This has no effect if the
floating-point option is not also enabled. Disabling fused
multiply/add and multiply/subtract instructions forces the
compiler to use separate instructions for the multiply and
add/subtract operations. This may be desirable in some cases
where strict IEEE 754-compliant results are required: the
fused multiply add/subtract instructions do not round the
intermediate result, thereby producing results with more
bits of precision than specified by the IEEE standard.
Disabling fused multiply add/subtract instructions also
ensures that the program output is not sensitive to the
compilers ability to combine multiply and add/subtract
operations.</p>

<p>-mserialize-volatile -mno-serialize-volatile When this
option is enabled, GCC inserts &quot;MEMW&quot; instructions
before &quot;volatile&quot; memory references to guarantee
sequential consistency. The default is -mserialize-volatile.
Use -mno-serialize-volatile to omit the &quot;MEMW&quot;
instructions.</p>

<p>-mtext-section-literals -mno-text-section-literals
Control the treatment of literal pools. The default is
-mno-text-section-literals, which places literals in a
separate section in the output file. This allows the literal
pool to be placed in a data RAM/ROM, and it also allows the
linker to combine literal pools from separate object files
to remove redundant literals and improve code size. With
-mtext-section-literals, the literals are interspersed in
the text section in order to keep them as close as possible
to their references. This may be necessary for large
assembly files.</p>

<p>-mtarget-align -mno-target-align When this option is
enabled, GCC instructs the assembler to automatically align
instructions to reduce branch penalties at the expense of
some code density. The assembler attempts to widen density
instructions to align branch targets and the instructions
following call instructions. If there are not enough
preceding safe density instructions to align a target, no
widening will be performed. The default is -mtarget-align.
These options do not affect the treatment of auto-aligned
instructions like &quot;LOOP&quot;, which the assembler will
always align, either by widening density instructions or by
inserting no-op instructions.</p>

<p>-mlongcalls -mno-longcalls When this option is enabled,
GCC instructs the assembler to translate direct calls to
indirect calls unless it can determine that the target of a
direct call is in the range allowed by the call instruction.
This translation typically occurs for calls to functions in
other source files. Specifically, the assembler translates a
direct &quot;CALL&quot; instruction into an &quot;L32R&quot;
followed by a &quot;CALLX&quot; instruction. The default is
-mno-longcalls. This option should be used in programs where
the call target can potentially be out of range. This option
is implemented in the assembler, not the compiler, so the
assembly code generated by GCC will still show direct call
instructions---look at the disassembled object code to see
the actual instructions. Note that the assembler will use an
indirect call for every cross-file call, not just those that
really will be out of range.</p>

<p>zSeries Options These are listed under</p>

<p>Options for Code Generation Conventions These
machine-independent options control the interface
conventions used in code generation.</p>

<p>Most of them have both positive and negative forms; the
negative form of -ffoo would be -fno-foo. In the table
below, only one of the forms is listed---the one which is
not the default. You can figure out the other form by either
removing no- or adding it.</p>

<p>-fbounds-check For front-ends that support it, generate
additional code to check that indices used to access arrays
are within the declared range. This is currently only
supported by the Java and Fortran front- ends, where this
option defaults to true and false respectively.</p>

<p>-ftrapv This option generates traps for signed overflow
on addition, subtraction, multiplication operations.</p>

<p>-fwrapv This option instructs the compiler to assume
that signed arithmetic overflow of addition, subtraction and
multiplication wraps around using twos-complement
representation. This flag enables some optimizations and
disables others. This option is enabled by default for the
Java front-end, as required by the Java language
specification.</p>

<p>-fexceptions Enable exception handling. Generates extra
code needed to propagate exceptions. For some targets, this
implies GCC will generate frame unwind information for all
functions, which can produce significant data size overhead,
although it does not affect execution. If you do not specify
this option, GCC will enable it by default for languages
like C++ which normally require exception handling, and
disable it for languages like C that do not normally require
it. However, you may need to enable this option when
compiling C code that needs to interoperate properly with
exception handlers written in C++. You may also wish to
disable this option if you are compiling older C++ programs
that dont use exception handling.</p>

<p>-fnon-call-exceptions Generate code that allows trapping
instructions to throw exceptions. Note that this requires
platform-specific runtime support that does not exist
everywhere. Moreover, it only allows trapping instructions
to throw exceptions, i.e. memory references or floating
point instructions. It does not allow exceptions to be
thrown from arbitrary signal handlers such as
&quot;SIGALRM&quot;.</p>

<p>-funwind-tables Similar to -fexceptions, except that it
will just generate any needed static data, but will not
affect the generated code in any other way. You will
normally not enable this option; instead, a language
processor that needs this handling would enable it on your
behalf.</p>

<p>-fasynchronous-unwind-tables Generate unwind table in
dwarf2 format, if supported by target machine. The table is
exact at each instruction boundary, so it can be used for
stack unwinding from asynchronous events (such as debugger
or garbage collector).</p>

<p>-fpcc-struct-return Return &quot;short&quot;
&quot;struct&quot; and &quot;union&quot; values in memory
like longer ones, rather than in registers. This convention
is less efficient, but it has the advantage of allowing
intercallability between GCC- compiled files and files
compiled with other compilers, particularly the Portable C
Compiler (pcc).</p>

<p>The precise convention for returning structures in
memory depends on the target configuration macros.</p>

<p>Short structures and unions are those whose size and
alignment match that of some integer type.</p>

<p>Warning: code compiled with the -fpcc-struct-return
switch is not binary compatible with code compiled with the
-freg-struct-return switch. Use it to conform to a
non-default application binary interface.</p>

<p>-freg-struct-return Return &quot;struct&quot; and
&quot;union&quot; values in registers when possible. This is
more efficient for small structures than
-fpcc-struct-return.</p>

<p>If you specify neither -fpcc-struct-return nor
-freg-struct-return, GCC defaults to whichever convention is
standard for the target. If there is no standard convention,
GCC defaults to -fpcc-struct-return, except on targets where
GCC is the principal compiler. In those cases, we can choose
the standard, and we chose the more efficient register
return alternative.</p>

<p>Warning: code compiled with the -freg-struct-return
switch is not binary compatible with code compiled with the
-fpcc-struct-return switch. Use it to conform to a
non-default application binary interface.</p>

<p>-fshort-enums Allocate to an &quot;enum&quot; type only
as many bytes as it needs for the declared range of possible
values. Specifically, the &quot;enum&quot; type will be
equivalent to the smallest integer type which has enough
room.</p>

<p>Warning: the -fshort-enums switch causes GCC to generate
code that is not binary compatible with code generated
without that switch. Use it to conform to a non-default
application binary interface.</p>

<p>-fshort-double Use the same size for &quot;double&quot;
as for &quot;float&quot;.</p>

<p>Warning: the -fshort-double switch causes GCC to
generate code that is not binary compatible with code
generated without that switch. Use it to conform to a
non-default application binary interface.</p>

<p>-fshort-wchar Override the underlying type for wchar_t
to be short unsigned int instead of the default for the
target. This option is useful for building programs to run
under WINE.</p>

<p>Warning: the -fshort-wchar switch causes GCC to generate
code that is not binary compatible with code generated
without that switch. Use it to conform to a non-default
application binary interface.</p>

<p>-fno-common In C code, controls the placement of
uninitialized global variables. Unix C compilers have
traditionally permitted multiple definitions of such
variables in different compilation units by placing the
variables in a common block. This is the behavior specified
by -fcommon, and is the default for GCC on most targets. On
the other hand, this behavior is not required by ISO C, and
on some targets may carry a speed or code size penalty on
variable references. The -fno-common option specifies that
the compiler should place uninitialized global variables in
the data section of the object file, rather than generating
them as common blocks. This has the effect that if the same
variable is declared (without &quot;extern&quot;) in two
different compilations, you will get a multiple- definition
error when you link them. In this case, you must compile
with -fcommon instead. Compiling with -fno-common is useful
on targets for which it provides better performance, or if
you wish to verify that the program will work on other
systems which always treat uninitialized variable
declarations this way.</p>

<p>-fno-ident Ignore the #ident directive.</p>

<p>-finhibit-size-directive Dont output a &quot;.size&quot;
assembler directive, or anything else that would cause
trouble if the function is split in the middle, and the two
halves are placed at locations far apart in memory. This
option is used when compiling crtstuff.c; you should not
need to use it for anything else.</p>

<p>-fverbose-asm Put extra commentary information in the
generated assembly code to make it more readable. This
option is generally only of use to those who actually need
to read the generated assembly code (perhaps while debugging
the compiler itself).</p>

<p>-fno-verbose-asm, the default, causes the extra
information to be omitted and is useful when comparing two
assembler files.</p>

<p>-frecord-gcc-switches This switch causes the command
line that was used to invoke the compiler to be recorded
into the object file that is being created. This switch is
only implemented on some targets and the exact format of the
recording is target and binary file format dependent, but it
usually takes the form of a section containing ASCII text.
This switch is related to the -fverbose-asm switch, but that
switch only records information in the assembler output file
as comments, so it never reaches the object file.</p>

<p>-fpic Generate position-independent code (PIC) suitable
for use in a shared library, if supported for the target
machine. Such code accesses all constant addresses through a
global offset table (GOT). The dynamic loader resolves the
GOT entries when the program starts (the dynamic loader is
not part of GCC; it is part of the operating system). If the
GOT size for the linked executable exceeds a
machine-specific maximum size, you get an error message from
the linker indicating that -fpic does not work; in that
case, recompile with -fPIC instead. (These maximums are 8k
on the SPARC and 32k on the m68k and RS/6000. The 386 has no
such limit.)</p>

<p>Position-independent code requires special support, and
therefore works only on certain machines. For the 386, GCC
supports PIC for System V but not for the Sun 386i. Code
generated for the IBM RS/6000 is always
position-independent.</p>

<p>When this flag is set, the macros &quot;__pic__&quot;
and &quot;__PIC__&quot; are defined to 1.</p>

<p>-fPIC If supported for the target machine, emit
position-independent code, suitable for dynamic linking and
avoiding any limit on the size of the global offset table.
This option makes a difference on the m68k, PowerPC and
SPARC.</p>

<p>Position-independent code requires special support, and
therefore works only on certain machines.</p>

<p>When this flag is set, the macros &quot;__pic__&quot;
and &quot;__PIC__&quot; are defined to 2.</p>

<p>-fpie -fPIE These options are similar to -fpic and
-fPIC, but generated position independent code can be only
linked into executables. Usually these options are used when
-pie GCC option will be used during linking.</p>

<p>-fpie and -fPIE both define the macros
&quot;__pie__&quot; and &quot;__PIE__&quot;. The macros have
the value 1 for -fpie and 2 for -fPIE.</p>

<p>-fno-jump-tables Do not use jump tables for switch
statements even where it would be more efficient than other
code generation strategies. This option is of use in
conjunction with -fpic or -fPIC for building code which
forms part of a dynamic linker and cannot reference the
address of a jump table. On some targets, jump tables do not
require a GOT and this option is not needed.</p>

<p>-ffixed-reg Treat the register named reg as a fixed
register; generated code should never refer to it (except
perhaps as a stack pointer, frame pointer or in some other
fixed role).</p>

<p>reg must be the name of a register. The register names
accepted are machine-specific and are defined in the
&quot;REGISTER_NAMES&quot; macro in the machine description
macro file.</p>

<p>This flag does not have a negative form, because it
specifies a three-way choice.</p>

<p>-fcall-used-reg Treat the register named reg as an
allocable register that is clobbered by function calls. It
may be allocated for temporaries or variables that do not
live across a call. Functions compiled this way will not
save and restore the register reg.</p>

<p>It is an error to used this flag with the frame pointer
or stack pointer. Use of this flag for other registers that
have fixed pervasive roles in the machines execution model
will produce disastrous results.</p>

<p>This flag does not have a negative form, because it
specifies a three-way choice.</p>

<p>-fcall-saved-reg Treat the register named reg as an
allocable register saved by functions. It may be allocated
even for temporaries or variables that live across a call.
Functions compiled this way will save and restore the
register reg if they use it.</p>

<p>It is an error to used this flag with the frame pointer
or stack pointer. Use of this flag for other registers that
have fixed pervasive roles in the machines execution model
will produce disastrous results.</p>

<p>A different sort of disaster will result from the use of
this flag for a register in which function values may be
returned.</p>

<p>This flag does not have a negative form, because it
specifies a three-way choice.</p>

<p>-fpack-struct[=n] Without a value specified, pack all
structure members together without holes. When a value is
specified (which must be a small power of two), pack
structure members according to this value, representing the
maximum alignment (that is, objects with default alignment
requirements larger than this will be output potentially
unaligned at the next fitting location.</p>

<p>Warning: the -fpack-struct switch causes GCC to generate
code that is not binary compatible with code generated
without that switch. Additionally, it makes the code
suboptimal. Use it to conform to a non-default application
binary interface.</p>

<p>-finstrument-functions Generate instrumentation calls
for entry and exit to functions. Just after function entry
and just before function exit, the following profiling
functions will be called with the address of the current
function and its call site. (On some platforms,
&quot;__builtin_return_address&quot; does not work beyond
the current function, so the call site information may not
be available to the profiling functions otherwise.)</p>

<p>void __cyg_profile_func_enter (void *this_fn, void
*call_site); void __cyg_profile_func_exit (void *this_fn,
void *call_site);</p>

<p>The first argument is the address of the start of the
current function, which may be looked up exactly in the
symbol table.</p>

<p>This instrumentation is also done for functions expanded
inline in other functions. The profiling calls will indicate
where, conceptually, the inline function is entered and
exited. This means that addressable versions of such
functions must be available. If all your uses of a function
are expanded inline, this may mean an additional expansion
of code size. If you use extern inline in your C code, an
addressable version of such functions must be provided.
(This is normally the case anyways, but if you get lucky and
the optimizer always expands the functions inline, you might
have gotten away without providing static copies.)</p>

<p>A function may be given the attribute
&quot;no_instrument_function&quot;, in which case this
instrumentation will not be done. This can be used, for
example, for the profiling functions listed above, high-
priority interrupt routines, and any functions from which
the profiling functions cannot safely be called (perhaps
signal handlers, if the profiling routines generate output
or allocate memory).</p>

<p>-finstrument-functions-exclude-file-list=file,file,...
Set the list of functions that are excluded from
instrumentation (see the description of
&quot;-finstrument-functions&quot;). If the file that
contains a function definition matches with one of file,
then that function is not instrumented. The match is done on
substrings: if the file parameter is a substring of the file
name, it is considered to be a match.</p>

<p>For example,
&quot;-finstrument-functions-exclude-file-list=/bits/stl,include/sys&quot;
will exclude any inline function defined in files whose
pathnames contain &quot;/bits/stl&quot; or
&quot;include/sys&quot;.</p>

<p>If, for some reason, you want to include letter
&rsquo;,&rsquo; in one of sym, write &rsquo;,&rsquo;. For
example,
&quot;-finstrument-functions-exclude-file-list=&rsquo;,,tmp&rsquo;&quot;
(note the single quote surrounding the option).</p>


<p>-finstrument-functions-exclude-function-list=sym,sym,...
This is similar to
&quot;-finstrument-functions-exclude-file-list&quot;, but
this option sets the list of function names to be excluded
from instrumentation. The function name to be matched is its
user- visible name, such as &quot;vector&lt;int&gt;
blah(const vector&lt;int&gt; &amp;)&quot;, not the internal
mangled name (e.g., &quot;_Z4blahRSt6vectorIiSaIiEE&quot;).
The match is done on substrings: if the sym parameter is a
substring of the function name, it is considered to be a
match.</p>

<p>-fstack-check Generate code to verify that you do not go
beyond the boundary of the stack. You should specify this
flag if you are running in an environment with multiple
threads, but only rarely need to specify it in a
single-threaded environment since stack overflow is
automatically detected on nearly all systems if there is
only one stack.</p>

<p>Note that this switch does not actually cause checking
to be done; the operating system or the language runtime
must do that. The switch causes generation of code to ensure
that they see the stack being extended.</p>

<p>You can additionally specify a string parameter:
&quot;no&quot; means no checking, &quot;generic&quot; means
force the use of old-style checking, &quot;specific&quot;
means use the best checking method and is equivalent to bare
-fstack-check.</p>

<p>Old-style checking is a generic mechanism that requires
no specific target support in the compiler but comes with
the following drawbacks:</p>

<p>1. Modified allocation strategy for large objects: they
will always be allocated dynamically if their size exceeds a
fixed threshold.</p>

<p>2. Fixed limit on the size of the static frame of
functions: when it is topped by a particular function, stack
checking is not reliable and a warning is issued by the
compiler.</p>

<p>3. Inefficiency: because of both the modified allocation
strategy and the generic implementation, the performances of
the code are hampered.</p>

<p>Note that old-style stack checking is also the fallback
method for &quot;specific&quot; if no target support has
been added in the compiler.</p>

<p>-fstack-limit-register=reg -fstack-limit-symbol=sym
-fno-stack-limit Generate code to ensure that the stack does
not grow beyond a certain value, either the value of a
register or the address of a symbol. If the stack would grow
beyond the value, a signal is raised. For most targets, the
signal is raised before the stack overruns the boundary, so
it is possible to catch the signal without taking special
precautions.</p>

<p>For instance, if the stack starts at absolute address
0x80000000 and grows downwards, you can use the flags
-fstack-limit-symbol=__stack_limit and
-Wl,--defsym,__stack_limit=0x7ffe0000 to enforce a stack
limit of 128KB. Note that this may only work with the GNU
linker.</p>

<p>-fargument-alias -fargument-noalias
-fargument-noalias-global -fargument-noalias-anything
Specify the possible relationships among parameters and
between parameters and global data.</p>

<p>-fargument-alias specifies that arguments (parameters)
may alias each other and may alias global
storage.-fargument-noalias specifies that arguments do not
alias each other, but may alias global
storage.-fargument-noalias-global specifies that arguments
do not alias each other and do not alias global storage.
-fargument-noalias-anything specifies that arguments do not
alias any other storage.</p>

<p>Each language will automatically use whatever option is
required by the language standard. You should not need to
use these options yourself.</p>

<p>-fleading-underscore This option and its counterpart,
-fno-leading-underscore, forcibly change the way C symbols
are represented in the object file. One use is to help link
with legacy assembly code.</p>

<p>Warning: the -fleading-underscore switch causes GCC to
generate code that is not binary compatible with code
generated without that switch. Use it to conform to a
non-default application binary interface. Not all targets
provide complete support for this switch.</p>

<p>-ftls-model=model Alter the thread-local storage model
to be used. The model argument should be one of
&quot;global-dynamic&quot;, &quot;local-dynamic&quot;,
&quot;initial-exec&quot; or &quot;local-exec&quot;.</p>

<p>The default without -fpic is &quot;initial-exec&quot;;
with -fpic the default is &quot;global-dynamic&quot;.</p>

<p>-fvisibility=default|internal|hidden|protected Set the
default ELF image symbol visibility to the specified
option---all symbols will be marked with this unless
overridden within the code. Using this feature can very
substantially improve linking and load times of shared
object libraries, produce more optimized code, provide
near-perfect API export and prevent symbol clashes. It is
strongly recommended that you use this in any shared objects
you distribute.</p>

<p>Despite the nomenclature, &quot;default&quot; always
means public ie; available to be linked against from outside
the shared object. &quot;protected&quot; and
&quot;internal&quot; are pretty useless in real-world usage
so the only other commonly used option will be
&quot;hidden&quot;. The default if -fvisibility isnt
specified is &quot;default&quot;, i.e., make every symbol
public---this causes the same behavior as previous versions
of GCC.</p>

<p>A good explanation of the benefits offered by ensuring
ELF symbols have the correct visibility is given by
&quot;How To Write Shared Libraries&quot; by Ulrich Drepper
(which can be found at
&lt;http://people.redhat.com/~drepper/&gt;)---however a
superior solution made possible by this option to marking
things hidden when the default is public is to make the
default hidden and mark things public. This is the norm with
DLLs on Windows and with -fvisibility=hidden and
&quot;__attribute__
((visibility(&quot;default&quot;)))&quot; instead of
&quot;__declspec(dllexport)&quot; you get almost identical
semantics with identical syntax. This is a great boon to
those working with cross-platform projects.</p>

<p>For those adding visibility support to existing code,
you may find #pragma GCC visibility of use. This works by
you enclosing the declarations you wish to set visibility
for with (for example) #pragma GCC visibility push(hidden)
and #pragma GCC visibility pop. Bear in mind that symbol
visibility should be viewed as part of the API interface
contract and thus all new code should always specify
visibility when it is not the default ie; declarations only
for use within the local DSO should always be marked
explicitly as hidden as so to avoid PLT indirection
overheads---making this abundantly clear also aids
readability and self-documentation of the code. Note that
due to ISO C++ specification requirements, operator new and
operator delete must always be of default visibility.</p>

<p>Be aware that headers from outside your project, in
particular system headers and headers from any other library
you use, may not be expecting to be compiled with visibility
other than the default. You may need to explicitly say
#pragma GCC visibility push(default) before including any
such headers.</p>

<p>extern declarations are not affected by -fvisibility, so
a lot of code can be recompiled with -fvisibility=hidden
with no modifications. However, this means that calls to
extern functions with no explicit visibility will use the
PLT, so it is more effective to use __attribute
((visibility)) and/or #pragma GCC visibility to tell the
compiler which extern declarations should be treated as
hidden.</p>

<p>Note that -fvisibility does affect C++ vague linkage
entities. This means that, for instance, an exception class
that will be thrown between DSOs must be explicitly marked
with default visibility so that the type_info nodes will be
unified between the DSOs.</p>

<p>An overview of these techniques, their benefits and how
to use them is at
&lt;http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Visibility&gt;.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT This section describes several environment
variables that affect how GCC operates. Some of them work by
specifying directories or prefixes to use when searching for
various kinds of files. Some are used to specify other
aspects of the compilation environment.</p>

<p>Note that you can also specify places to search using
options such as -B, -I and -L. These take precedence over
places specified using environment variables, which in turn
take precedence over those specified by the configuration of
GCC.</p>

<p>LANG LC_CTYPE LC_MESSAGES LC_ALL These environment
variables control the way that GCC uses localization
information that allow GCC to work with different national
conventions. GCC inspects the locale categories LC_CTYPE and
LC_MESSAGES if it has been configured to do so. These locale
categories can be set to any value supported by your
installation. A typical value is en_GB.UTF-8 for English in
the United Kingdom encoded in UTF-8.</p>

<p>The LC_CTYPE environment variable specifies character
classification. GCC uses it to determine the character
boundaries in a string; this is needed for some multibyte
encodings that contain quote and escape characters that
would otherwise be interpreted as a string end or
escape.</p>

<p>The LC_MESSAGES environment variable specifies the
language to use in diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>If the LC_ALL environment variable is set, it overrides
the value of LC_CTYPE and LC_MESSAGES; otherwise, LC_CTYPE
and LC_MESSAGES default to the value of the LANG environment
variable. If none of these variables are set, GCC defaults
to traditional C English behavior.</p>

<p>TMPDIR If TMPDIR is set, it specifies the directory to
use for temporary files. GCC uses temporary files to hold
the output of one stage of compilation which is to be used
as input to the next stage: for example, the output of the
preprocessor, which is the input to the compiler proper.</p>

<p>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX If GCC_EXEC_PREFIX is set, it specifies
a prefix to use in the names of the subprograms executed by
the compiler. No slash is added when this prefix is combined
with the name of a subprogram, but you can specify a prefix
that ends with a slash if you wish.</p>

<p>If GCC_EXEC_PREFIX is not set, GCC will attempt to
figure out an appropriate prefix to use based on the
pathname it was invoked with.</p>

<p>If GCC cannot find the subprogram using the specified
prefix, it tries looking in the usual places for the
subprogram.</p>

<p>The default value of GCC_EXEC_PREFIX is prefix/lib/gcc/
where prefix is the prefix to the installed compiler. In
many cases prefix is the value of &quot;prefix&quot; when
you ran the configure script.</p>

<p>Other prefixes specified with -B take precedence over
this prefix.</p>

<p>This prefix is also used for finding files such as
crt0.o that are used for linking.</p>

<p>In addition, the prefix is used in an unusual way in
finding the directories to search for header files. For each
of the standard directories whose name normally begins with
/usr/local/lib/gcc (more precisely, with the value of
GCC_INCLUDE_DIR), GCC tries replacing that beginning with
the specified prefix to produce an alternate directory name.
Thus, with -Bfoo/, GCC will search foo/bar where it would
normally search /usr/local/lib/bar. These alternate
directories are searched first; the standard directories
come next. If a standard directory begins with the
configured prefix then the value of prefix is replaced by
GCC_EXEC_PREFIX when looking for header files.</p>

<p>COMPILER_PATH The value of COMPILER_PATH is a
colon-separated list of directories, much like PATH. GCC
tries the directories thus specified when searching for
subprograms, if it cant find the subprograms using
GCC_EXEC_PREFIX.</p>

<p>LIBRARY_PATH The value of LIBRARY_PATH is a
colon-separated list of directories, much like PATH. When
configured as a native compiler, GCC tries the directories
thus specified when searching for special linker files, if
it can t find them using GCC_EXEC_PREFIX. Linking using GCC
also uses these directories when searching for ordinary
libraries for the -l option (but directories specified with
-L come first).</p>

<p>LANG This variable is used to pass locale information to
the compiler. One way in which this information is used is
to determine the character set to be used when character
literals, string literals and comments are parsed in C and
C++. When the compiler is configured to allow multibyte
characters, the following values for LANG are
recognized:</p>

<p>C-JIS Recognize JIS characters.</p>

<p>C-SJIS Recognize SJIS characters.</p>

<p>C-EUCJP Recognize EUCJP characters.</p>

<p>If LANG is not defined, or if it has some other value,
then the compiler will use mblen and mbtowc as defined by
the default locale to recognize and translate multibyte
characters.</p>

<p>Some additional environments variables affect the
behavior of the preprocessor.</p>

<p>CPATH C_INCLUDE_PATH CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH
OBJC_INCLUDE_PATH Each variable s value is a list of
directories separated by a special character, much like
PATH, in which to look for header files. The special
character, &quot;PATH_SEPARATOR&quot;, is target- dependent
and determined at GCC build time. For Microsoft Windows-
based targets it is a semicolon, and for almost all other
targets it is a colon.</p>

<p>CPATH specifies a list of directories to be searched as
if specified with -I, but after any paths given with -I
options on the command line. This environment variable is
used regardless of which language is being preprocessed.</p>

<p>The remaining environment variables apply only when
preprocessing the particular language indicated. Each
specifies a list of directories to be searched as if
specified with -isystem, but after any paths given with
-isystem options on the command line.</p>

<p>In all these variables, an empty element instructs the
compiler to search its current working directory. Empty
elements can appear at the beginning or end of a path. For
instance, if the value of CPATH is
&quot;:/special/include&quot;, that has the same effect as
-I. -I/special/include.</p>

<p>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT If this variable is set, its value
specifies how to output dependencies for Make based on the
non-system header files processed by the compiler. System
header files are ignored in the dependency output.</p>

<p>The value of DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT can be just a file
name, in which case the Make rules are written to that file,
guessing the target name from the source file name. Or the
value can have the form file target, in which case the rules
are written to file file using target as the target
name.</p>

<p>In other words, this environment variable is equivalent
to combining the options -MM and -MF, with an optional -MT
switch too.</p>

<p>SUNPRO_DEPENDENCIES This variable is the same as
DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT (see above), except that system header
files are not ignored, so it implies -M rather than -MM.
However, the dependence on the main input file is
omitted.</p>

<p>FOOTNOTES 1. On some systems, gcc -shared needs to build
supplementary stub code for constructors to work. On
multi-libbed systems, gcc -shared must select the correct
support libraries to link against. Failing to supply the
correct flags may lead to subtle defects. Supplying them in
cases where they are not necessary is innocuous.</p>
