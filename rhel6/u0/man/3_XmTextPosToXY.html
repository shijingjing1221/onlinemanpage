<p>NAME XmTextPosToXY A Text function that accesses the x
and y position of a character position</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;Xm/Text.h&gt; Boolean
XmTextPosToXY( Widget widget, XmTextPosition position,
Position *x, Position *y);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION XmTextPosToXY accesses the x and y position,
relative to the upper left corner of the Text widget, of a
given character position in the text buffer.</p>

<p>In the case of horizontal writing, the position is the
origin of the character. In the case of vertical writing,
the position is the verti- cal origin of the character.</p>

<p>widget Specifies the Text widget ID</p>

<p>position Specifies the character position in the text
for which the x and y position is accessed. This is an
integer number of characters from the beginning of the
buffer. The first char- acter position is 0 (zero).</p>

<p>x Specifies the pointer in which the x position is
returned. The returned position is the distance from the
left side of the widget to the left border of the character.
This value is meaningful only if the function returns
True.</p>

<p>y Specifies the pointer in which the y position is
returned. The returned position is the distance from the top
of the widget to the characters baseline. This value is
meaningful only if the function returns True.</p>

<p>For a complete definition of Text and its associated
resources, see XmText(3).</p>

<p>RETURN This function returns True if the character
position is displayed in the Text widget; otherwise, it
returns False, and no x or y value is returned.</p>
