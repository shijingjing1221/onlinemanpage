<p>REALLOC(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual REALLOC(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME realloc - memory reallocator</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</p>

<p>void *realloc(void *ptr, size_t size);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The realloc() function shall change the size
of the memory object pointed to by ptr to the size specified
by size. The contents of the object shall remain unchanged
up to the lesser of the new and old sizes. If the new size
of the memory object would require movement of the object,
the space for the previous instantiation of the object is
freed. If the new size is larger, the contents of the newly
allocated portion of the object are unspecified. If size is
0 and ptr is not a null pointer, the object pointed to is
freed. If the space cannot be allocated, the object shall
remain unchanged.</p>

<p>If ptr is a null pointer, realloc() shall be equivalent
to malloc() for the specified size.</p>

<p>If ptr does not match a pointer returned earlier by
calloc(), malloc(), or realloc() or if the space has
previously been deallocated by a call to free() or
realloc(), the behavior is undefined.</p>

<p>The order and contiguity of storage allocated by
successive calls to realloc() is unspecified. The pointer
returned if the allocation suc- ceeds shall be suitably
aligned so that it may be assigned to a pointer to any type
of object and then used to access such an object in the
space allocated (until the space is explicitly freed or
reallocated). Each such allocation shall yield a pointer to
an object disjoint from any other object. The pointer
returned shall point to the start (lowest byte address) of
the allocated space. If the space cannot be allocated, a
null pointer shall be returned.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion with a size not
equal to 0, realloc() shall return a pointer to the
(possibly moved) allocated space. If size is 0, either a
null pointer or a unique pointer that can be successfully
passed to free() shall be returned. If there is not enough
available memory, realloc() shall return a null pointer and
set errno to [ENOMEM].</p>

<p>ERRORS The realloc() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>ENOMEM Insufficient memory is available.</p>
