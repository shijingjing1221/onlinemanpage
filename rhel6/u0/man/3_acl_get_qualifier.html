<p>ACL_GET_QUALIFIER(3) BSD Library Functions Manual
ACL_GET_QUALIFIER(3)</p>

<p>NAME acl_get_qualifier - retrieve the qualifier from an
ACL entry</p>

<p>LIBRARY Linux Access Control Lists library (libacl,
-lacl).</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; #include
&lt;sys/acl.h&gt;</p>

<p>void * acl_get_qualifier(acl_entry_t entry_d);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The acl_get_qualifier() function retrieves
the qualifier from the ACL entry indicated by the argument
entry_d into working storage and returns a pointer to that
storage.</p>

<p>If the value of the tag type in the ACL entry referred
to by entry_d is ACL_USER, then the value returned by
acl_get_qualifier() is a pointer to type uid_t. If the value
of the tag type in the ACL entry referred to by entry_d is
ACL_GROUP, then the value returned by acl_get_qualifier() is
a pointer to type gid_t. If the tag type in the ACL entry
referred to by entry_d is a tag type for which a qualifier
is not supported, acl_get_qualifier() returns a value of
(void *)NULL and the function fails. Subsequent operations
using the returned pointer operate on an independent copy of
the qualifier in working storage, and will not change the
qualifier of the ACL entry.</p>

<p>This function may cause memory to be allocated. The
caller should free any releasable memory, when the new
qualifier is no longer required, by calling acl_free() with
the void * value returned by acl_get_qualifier() as an
argument.</p>

<p>The argument entry_d and any other ACL entry descriptors
that refer to entries within the ACL containing the entry
referred to by entry_d con- tinue to refer to those entries.
The order of all existing entries in the ACL containing the
entry referred to by entry_d remains unchanged.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, the function returns a pointer
to the tag qualifier that was retrieved into ACL working
storage. On error, a value of (void *)NULL is returned and
errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS If any of the following conditions occur, the
acl_get_qualifier() func- tion returns (void *)NULL and sets
errno to the corresponding value:</p>

<p>[EINVAL] The argument entry_d is not a valid descriptor
for an ACL entry.</p>

<p>The value of the tag type in the ACL entry referenced by
the argument entry_d is neither ACL_USER nor ACL_GROUP.</p>

<p>[ENOMEM] The value to be returned requires more memory
than is allowed by the hardware or system-imposed memory
man- agement constraints.</p>

<p>STANDARDS IEEE Std 1003.1e draft 17 (POSIX.1e,
abandoned)</p>
