<p>GIT-IMAP-SEND(1) Git Manual GIT-IMAP-SEND(1)</p>

<p>NAME git-imap-send - Send a collection of patches from
stdin to an IMAP folder</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS git imap-send</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This command uploads a mailbox generated
with git format-patch into an IMAP drafts folder. This
allows patches to be sent as other email is when using mail
clients that cannot read mailbox files directly. The command
also works with any general mailbox in which emails have the
fields &quot;From&quot;, &quot;Date&quot;, and
&quot;Subject&quot; in that order.</p>

<p>Typical usage is something like:</p>

<p>git format-patch --signoff --stdout --attach origin |
git imap-send</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION To use the tool, imap.folder and either
imap.tunnel or imap.host must be set to appropriate
values.</p>

<p>Variables imap.folder The folder to drop the mails into,
which is typically the Drafts folder. For example:
&quot;INBOX.Drafts&quot;, &quot;INBOX/Drafts&quot; or
&quot;[Gmail]/Drafts&quot;. Required to use imap-send.</p>

<p>imap.tunnel Command used to setup a tunnel to the IMAP
server through which commands will be piped instead of using
a direct network connection to the server. Required when
imap.host is not set to use imap-send.</p>

<p>imap.host A URL identifying the server. Use a imap://
prefix for non-secure connections and a imaps:// prefix for
secure connections. Ignored when imap.tunnel is set, but
required to use imap-send otherwise.</p>

<p>imap.user The username to use when logging in to the
server.</p>

<p>imap.pass The password to use when logging in to the
server.</p>

<p>imap.port An integer port number to connect to on the
server. Defaults to 143 for imap:// hosts and 993 for
imaps:// hosts. Ignored when imap.tunnel is set.</p>

<p>imap.sslverify A boolean to enable/disable verification
of the server certificate used by the SSL/TLS connection.
Default is true. Ignored when imap.tunnel is set.</p>

<p>imap.preformattedHTML A boolean to enable/disable the
use of html encoding when sending a patch. An html encoded
patch will be bracketed with &lt;pre&gt; and have a content
type of text/html. Ironically, enabling this option causes
Thunderbird to send the patch as a plain/text, format=fixed
email. Default is false.</p>

<p>imap.authMethod Specify authenticate method for
authentication with IMAP server. Current supported method is
CRAM-MD5 only.</p>

<p>Examples Using tunnel mode:</p>

<p>[imap] folder = &quot;INBOX.Drafts&quot; tunnel =
&quot;ssh -q -C user@example.com /usr/bin/imapd ./Maildir
2&gt; /dev/null&quot;</p>

<p>Using direct mode:</p>

<p>[imap] folder = &quot;INBOX.Drafts&quot; host =
imap://imap.example.com user = bob pass = p4ssw0rd</p>

<p>Using direct mode with SSL:</p>

<p>[imap] folder = &quot;INBOX.Drafts&quot; host =
imaps://imap.example.com user = bob pass = p4ssw0rd port =
123 sslverify = false</p>

<p>CAUTION It is still your responsibility to make sure
that the email message sent by your email program meets the
standards of your project. Many projects do not like patches
to be attached. Some mail agents will transform patches
(e.g. wrap lines, send them as format=flowed) in ways that
make them fail. You will get angry flames ridiculing you if
you dont check this.</p>

<p>Thunderbird in particular is known to be problematic.
