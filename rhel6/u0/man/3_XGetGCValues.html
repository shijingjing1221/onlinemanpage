<p>XCreateGC(3) XLIB FUNCTIONS XCreateGC(3)</p>

<p>NAME XCreateGC, XCopyGC, XChangeGC, XGetGCValues,
XFreeGC, XGContextFromGC, XGCValues - create or free
graphics contexts and graphics context structure</p>

<p>SYNTAX GC XCreateGC(Display *display, Drawable d,
unsigned long valuemask, XGCValues *values);</p>

<p>int XCopyGC(Display *display, GC src, unsigned long
valuemask, GC dest);</p>

<p>int XChangeGC(Display *display, GC gc, unsigned long
valuemask, XGCVal- ues *values);</p>

<p>Status XGetGCValues(Display *display, GC gc, unsigned
long valuemask, XGCValues *values_return);</p>

<p>int XFreeGC(Display *display, GC gc);</p>

<p>GContext XGContextFromGC(GC gc);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS d Specifies the drawable.</p>

<p>dest Specifies the destination GC.</p>

<p>display Specifies the connection to the X server.</p>

<p>gc Specifies the GC.</p>

<p>src Specifies the components of the source GC.</p>

<p>valuemask Specifies which components in the GC are to be
set, copied, changed, or returned . This argument is the
bitwise inclu- sive OR of zero or more of the valid GC
component mask bits.</p>

<p>values Specifies any values as specified by the
valuemask.</p>

<p>values_return Returns the GC values in the specified
XGCValues structure.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The XCreateGC function creates a graphics
context and returns a GC. The GC can be used with any
destination drawable having the same root and depth as the
specified drawable. Use with other drawables results in a
BadMatch error.</p>

<p>XCreateGC can generate BadAlloc, BadDrawable, BadFont,
BadMatch, Bad- Pixmap, and BadValue errors.</p>

<p>The XCopyGC function copies the specified components
from the source GC to the destination GC. The source and
destination GCs must have the same root and depth, or a
BadMatch error results. The valuemask speci- fies which
component to copy, as for XCreateGC.</p>

<p>XCopyGC can generate BadAlloc, BadGC, and BadMatch
errors.</p>

<p>The XChangeGC function changes the components specified
by valuemask for the specified GC. The values argument
contains the values to be set. The values and restrictions
are the same as for XCreateGC. Changing the clip-mask
overrides any previous XSetClipRectangles request on the
context. Changing the dash-offset or dash-list over- rides
any previous XSetDashes request on the context. The order in
which components are verified and altered is server
dependent. If an error is generated, a subset of the
components may have been altered.</p>

<p>XChangeGC can generate BadAlloc, BadFont, BadGC,
BadMatch, BadPixmap, and BadValue errors.</p>

<p>The XGetGCValues function returns the components
specified by valuemask for the specified GC. If the
valuemask contains a valid set of GC mask bits (GCFunction,
GCPlaneMask, GCForeground, GCBackground, GCLineWidth,
GCLineStyle, GCCapStyle, GCJoinStyle, GCFillStyle,
GCFillRule, GCTile, GCStipple, GCTileStipXOrigin,
GCTileStipYOrigin, GCFont, GCSubwindow- Mode,
GCGraphicsExposures, GCClipXOrigin, GCCLipYOrigin,
GCDashOffset, or GCArcMode) and no error occurs,
XGetGCValues sets the requested com- ponents in
values_return and returns a nonzero status. Otherwise, it
returns a zero status. Note that the clip-mask and dash-list
(repre- sented by the GCClipMask and GCDashList bits,
respectively, in the val- uemask) cannot be requested. Also
note that an invalid resource ID (with one or more of the
three most significant bits set to 1) will be returned for
GCFont, GCTile, and GCStipple if the component has never
been explicitly set by the client.</p>

<p>The XFreeGC function destroys the specified GC as well
as all the asso- ciated storage.</p>

<p>XFreeGC can generate a BadGC error.</p>

<p>The function attributes of a GC are used when you update
a section of a drawable (the destination) with bits from
somewhere else (the source). The function in a GC defines
how the new destination bits are to be computed from the
source bits and the old destination bits. GXcopy is
typically the most useful because it will work on a color
display, but special applications may use other functions,
particularly in concert with particular planes of a color
display. The 16 GC functions, defined in &lt;X11/X.h&gt;,
are:</p>

<p>----------------------------------------------- Function
Name Value Operation
----------------------------------------------- () ()</p>

<p>GXclear 0x0 0 GXand 0x1 src AND dst GXandReverse 0x2 src
AND NOT dst GXcopy 0x3 src GXandInverted 0x4 (NOT src) AND
dst GXnoop 0x5 dst GXxor 0x6 src XOR dst GXor 0x7 src OR dst
GXnor 0x8 (NOT src) AND (NOT dst) GXequiv 0x9 (NOT src) XOR
dst GXinvert 0xa NOT dst GXorReverse 0xb src OR (NOT dst)
GXcopyInverted 0xc NOT src GXorInverted 0xd (NOT src) OR dst
GXnand 0xe (NOT src) OR (NOT dst) GXset 0xf 1
-----------------------------------------------</p>

<p>Many graphics operations depend on either pixel values
or planes in a GC. The planes attribute is of type long, and
it specifies which planes of the destination are to be
modified, one bit per plane. A monochrome display has only
one plane and will be the least significant bit of the word.
As planes are added to the display hardware, they will
occupy more significant bits in the plane mask.</p>

<p>In graphics operations, given a source and destination
pixel, the result is computed bitwise on corresponding bits
of the pixels. That is, a Boolean operation is performed in
each bit plane. The plane_mask restricts the operation to a
subset of planes. A macro constant AllPlanes can be used to
refer to all planes of the screen simultane- ously. The
result is computed by the following:</p>

<p>((src FUNC dst) AND plane-mask) OR (dst AND (NOT
plane-mask))</p>

<p>Range checking is not performed on the values for
foreground, back- ground, or plane_mask. They are simply
truncated to the appropriate number of bits. The line-width
is measured in pixels and either can be greater than or
equal to one (wide line) or can be the special value zero
(thin line).</p>

<p>Wide lines are drawn centered on the path described by
the graphics request. Unless otherwise specified by the
join-style or cap-style, the bounding box of a wide line
with endpoints [x1, y1], [x2, y2] and width w is a rectangle
with vertices at the following real coordinates:</p>

<p>[x1-(w*sn/2), y1+(w*cs/2)], [x1+(w*sn/2), y1-(w*cs/2)],
[x2-(w*sn/2), y2+(w*cs/2)], [x2+(w*sn/2), y2-(w*cs/2)]</p>

<p>Here sn is the sine of the angle of the line, and cs is
the cosine of the angle of the line. A pixel is part of the
line and so is drawn if the center of the pixel is fully
inside the bounding box (which is viewed as having
infinitely thin edges). If the center of the pixel is
exactly on the bounding box, it is part of the line if and
only if the interior is immediately to its right (x
increasing direction). Pixels with centers on a horizontal
edge are a special case and are part of the line if and only
if the interior or the boundary is immediately below (y
increasing direction) and the interior or the boundary is
immediately to the right (x increasing direction).</p>

<p>Thin lines (zero line-width) are one-pixel-wide lines
drawn using an unspecified, device-dependent algorithm.
There are only two con- straints on this algorithm.</p>

<p>1. If a line is drawn unclipped from [x1,y1] to [x2,y2]
and if another line is drawn unclipped from [x1+dx,y1+dy] to
[x2+dx,y2+dy], a point [x,y] is touched by drawing the first
line if and only if the point [x+dx,y+dy] is touched by
drawing the second line.</p>

<p>2. The effective set of points comprising a line cannot
be affected by clipping. That is, a point is touched in a
clipped line if and only if the point lies inside the
clipping region and the point would be touched by the line
when drawn unclipped.</p>

<p>A wide line drawn from [x1,y1] to [x2,y2] always draws
the same pixels as a wide line drawn from [x2,y2] to
[x1,y1], not counting cap-style and join-style. It is
recommended that this property be true for thin lines, but
this is not required. A line-width of zero may differ from a
line-width of one in which pixels are drawn. This permits
the use of many manufacturers line drawing hardware, which
may run many times faster than the more precisely specified
wide lines.</p>

<p>In general, drawing a thin line will be faster than
drawing a wide line of width one. However, because of their
different drawing algorithms, thin lines may not mix well
aesthetically with wide lines. If it is desirable to obtain
precise and uniform results across all displays, a client
should always use a line-width of one rather than a
line-width of zero.</p>

<p>The line-style defines which sections of a line are
drawn:</p>

<p>LineSolid The full path of the line is drawn.</p>

<p>LineDou- The full path of the line is drawn, but the
bleDash even dashes are filled differently from the odd
dashes (see fill-style) with CapButt style used where even
and odd dashes meet. LineOnOffDash Only the even dashes are
drawn, and cap-style applies to all internal ends of the
individ- ual dashes, except CapNotLast is treated as
CapButt.</p>

<p>The cap-style defines how the endpoints of a path are
drawn:</p>

<p>CapNotLast This is equivalent to CapButt except that for
a line-width of zero the final endpoint is not drawn.
CapButt The line is square at the endpoint (perpen- dicular
to the slope of the line) with no projection beyond.
CapRound The line has a circular arc with the diameter equal
to the line-width, centered on the end- point. (This is
equivalent to CapButt for line-width of zero). CapProjecting
The line is square at the end, but the path continues beyond
the endpoint for a distance equal to half the line-width.
(This is equivalent to CapButt for line-width of zero).</p>

<p>The join-style defines how corners are drawn for wide
lines:</p>

<p>JoinMiter The outer edges of two lines extend to meet at
an angle. However, if the angle is less than 11 degrees,
then a JoinBevel join-style is used instead. JoinRound The
corner is a circular arc with the diame- ter equal to the
line-width, centered on the joinpoint. JoinBevel The corner
has CapButt endpoint styles with the triangular notch
filled.</p>

<p>For a line with coincident endpoints (x1=x2, y1=y2),
when the cap-style is applied to both endpoints, the
semantics depends on the line-width and the cap-style:</p>

<p>CapNotLast thin The results are device dependent, but
the desired effect is that nothing is drawn. CapButt thin
The results are device dependent, but the desired effect is
that a single pixel is drawn. CapRound thin The results are
the same as for Cap- Butt/thin. CapProjecting thin The
results are the same as for Cap- Butt/thin. CapButt wide
Nothing is drawn. CapRound wide The closed path is a circle,
centered at the endpoint, and with the diameter equal to the
line-width. CapProjecting wide The closed path is a square,
aligned with the coordinate axes, centered at the endpoint,
and with the sides equal to the line-width.</p>

<p>For a line with coincident endpoints (x1=x2, y1=y2),
when the join- style is applied at one or both endpoints,
the effect is as if the line was removed from the overall
path. However, if the total path consists of or is reduced
to a single point joined with itself, the effect is the same
as when the cap-style is applied at both endpoints.</p>

<p>The tile/stipple represents an infinite two-dimensional
plane, with the tile/stipple replicated in all dimensions.
When that plane is superim- posed on the drawable for use in
a graphics operation, the upper-left corner of some instance
of the tile/stipple is at the coordinates within the
drawable specified by the tile/stipple origin. The
tile/stipple and clip origins are interpreted relative to
the origin of whatever destination drawable is specified in
a graphics request. The tile pixmap must have the same root
and depth as the GC, or a BadMatch error results. The
stipple pixmap must have depth one and must have the same
root as the GC, or a BadMatch error results. For stipple
operations where the fill-style is FillStippled but not
FillOpaqueStip- pled, the stipple pattern is tiled in a
single plane and acts as an additional clip mask to be ANDed
with the clip-mask. Although some sizes may be faster to use
than others, any size pixmap can be used for tiling or
stippling.</p>

<p>The fill-style defines the contents of the source for
line, text, and fill requests. For all text and fill
requests (for example, XDrawText, XDrawText16,
XFillRectangle, XFillPolygon, and XFillArc); for line
requests with line-style LineSolid (for example, XDrawLine,
XDrawSeg- ments, XDrawRectangle, XDrawArc); and for the even
dashes for line requests with line-style LineOnOffDash or
LineDoubleDash, the following apply:</p>

<p>FillSolid Foreground FillTiled Tile FillOpaqueStippled A
tile with the same width and height as stipple, but with
background everywhere stipple has a zero and with foreground
everywhere stipple has a one FillStippled Foreground masked
by stipple</p>

<p>When drawing lines with line-style LineDoubleDash, the
odd dashes are controlled by the fill-style in the following
manner:</p>

<p>FillSolid Background FillTiled Same as for even dashes
FillOpaqueStippled Same as for even dashes FillStippled
Background masked by stipple</p>

<p>Storing a pixmap in a GC might or might not result in a
copy being made. If the pixmap is later used as the
destination for a graphics request, the change might or
might not be reflected in the GC. If the pixmap is used
simultaneously in a graphics request both as a destina- tion
and as a tile or stipple, the results are undefined.</p>

<p>For optimum performance, you should draw as much as
possible with the same GC (without changing its components).
The costs of changing GC components relative to using
different GCs depend on the display hard- ware and the
server implementation. It is quite likely that some amount
of GC information will be cached in display hardware and
that such hardware can only cache a small number of GCs.</p>

<p>The dashes value is actually a simplified form of the
more general pat- terns that can be set with XSetDashes.
Specifying a value of N is equivalent to specifying the
two-element list [N, N] in XSetDashes. The value must be
nonzero, or a BadValue error results.</p>

<p>The clip-mask restricts writes to the destination
drawable. If the clip-mask is set to a pixmap, it must have
depth one and have the same root as the GC, or a BadMatch
error results. If clip-mask is set to None, the pixels are
always drawn regardless of the clip origin. The clip-mask
also can be set by calling the XSetClipRectangles or XSetRe-
gion functions. Only pixels where the clip-mask has a bit
set to 1 are drawn. Pixels are not drawn outside the area
covered by the clip-mask or where the clip-mask has a bit
set to 0. The clip-mask affects all graphics requests. The
clip-mask does not clip sources. The clip-mask origin is
interpreted relative to the origin of whatever destination
drawable is specified in a graphics request.</p>

<p>You can set the subwindow-mode to ClipByChildren or
IncludeInferiors. For ClipByChildren, both source and
destination windows are addition- ally clipped by all
viewable InputOutput children. For IncludeInferi- ors,
neither source nor destination window is clipped by
inferiors. This will result in including subwindow contents
in the source and drawing through subwindow boundaries of
the destination. The use of IncludeInferiors on a window of
one depth with mapped inferiors of dif- fering depth is not
illegal, but the semantics are undefined by the core
protocol.</p>

<p>The fill-rule defines what pixels are inside (drawn) for
paths given in XFillPolygon requests and can be set to
EvenOddRule or WindingRule. For EvenOddRule, a point is
inside if an infinite ray with the point as origin crosses
the path an odd number of times. For WindingRule, a point is
inside if an infinite ray with the point as origin crosses
an unequal number of clockwise and counterclockwise directed
path seg- ments. A clockwise directed path segment is one
that crosses the ray from left to right as observed from the
point. A counterclockwise seg- ment is one that crosses the
ray from right to left as observed from the point. The case
where a directed line segment is coincident with the ray is
uninteresting because you can simply choose a different ray
that is not coincident with a segment.</p>

<p>For both EvenOddRule and WindingRule, a point is
infinitely small, and the path is an infinitely thin line. A
pixel is inside if the center point of the pixel is inside
and the center point is not on the bound- ary. If the center
point is on the boundary, the pixel is inside if and only if
the polygon interior is immediately to its right (x
increasing direction). Pixels with centers on a horizontal
edge are a special case and are inside if and only if the
polygon interior is immediately below (y increasing
direction).</p>

<p>The arc-mode controls filling in the XFillArcs function
and can be set to ArcPieSlice or ArcChord. For ArcPieSlice,
the arcs are pie-slice filled. For ArcChord, the arcs are
chord filled.</p>

<p>The graphics-exposure flag controls GraphicsExpose event
generation for XCopyArea and XCopyPlane requests (and any
similar requests defined by extensions).</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS BadAlloc The server failed to allocate the
requested resource or server memory.</p>

<p>BadDrawable A value for a Drawable argument does not
name a defined Win- dow or Pixmap.</p>

<p>BadFont A value for a Font or GContext argument does not
name a defined Font.</p>

<p>BadGC A value for a GContext argument does not name a
defined GCon- text.</p>

<p>BadMatch An InputOnly window is used as a Drawable.</p>

<p>BadMatch Some argument or pair of arguments has the
correct type and range but fails to match in some other way
required by the request.</p>

<p>BadPixmap A value for a Pixmap argument does not name a
defined Pixmap.</p>

<p>BadValue Some numeric value falls outside the range of
values accepted by the request. Unless a specific range is
specified for an argument, the full range defined by the
argument s type is accepted. Any argument defined as a set
of alternatives can generate this error.</p>
