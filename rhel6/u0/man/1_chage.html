<p>NAME chage - change user password expiry information</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS chage [options] [LOGIN]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The chage command changes the number of days
between password changes and the date of the last password
change. This information is used by the system to determine
when a user must change his/her password.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The options which apply to the chage command
are:</p>

<p>-d, --lastday LAST_DAY Set the number of days since
January 1st, 1970 when the password was last changed. The
date may also be expressed in the format YYYY-MM-DD (or the
format more commonly used in your area).</p>

<p>-E, --expiredate EXPIRE_DATE Set the date or number of
days since January 1, 1970 on which the user&acute;s account
will no longer be accessible. The date may also be expressed
in the format YYYY-MM-DD (or the format more commonly used
in your area). A user whose account is locked must contact
the system administrator before being able to use the system
again.</p>

<p>Passing the number -1 as the EXPIRE_DATE will remove an
account expiration date.</p>

<p>-h, --help Display help message and exit.</p>

<p>-I, --inactive INACTIVE Set the number of days of
inactivity after a password has expired before the account
is locked. The INACTIVE option is the number of days of
inactivity. A user whose account is locked must contact the
system administrator before being able to use the system
again.</p>

<p>Passing the number -1 as the INACTIVE will remove an
account&acute;s inactivity.</p>

<p>-l, --list Show account aging information.</p>

<p>-m, --mindays MIN_DAYS Set the minimum number of days
between password changes to MIN_DAYS. A value of zero for
this field indicates that the user may change his/her
password at any time.</p>

<p>-M, --maxdays MAX_DAYS Set the maximum number of days
during which a password is valid. When MAX_DAYS plus
LAST_DAY is less than the current day, the user will be
required to change his/her password before being able to use
his/her account. This occurrence can be planned for in
advance by use of the -W option, which provides the user
with advance warning.</p>

<p>Passing the number -1 as MAX_DAYS will remove checking a
password&acute;s validity.</p>

<p>-W, --warndays WARN_DAYS Set the number of days of
warning before a password change is required. The WARN_DAYS
option is the number of days prior to the password expiring
that a user will be warned his/her password is about to
expire.</p>

<p>If none of the options are selected, chage operates in
an interactive fashion, prompting the user with the current
values for all of the fields. Enter the new value to change
the field, or leave the line blank to use the current value.
The current value is displayed between a pair of [ ]
marks.</p>

<p>NOTE The chage program requires a shadow password file
to be available.</p>

<p>The chage command is restricted to the root user, except
for the -l option, which may be used by an unprivileged user
to determine when his/her password or account is due to
expire.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/passwd User account information.</p>

<p>/etc/shadow Secure user account information.</p>

<p>EXIT VALUES The chage command exits with the following
values:</p>

<p>0 success</p>

<p>1 permission denied</p>

<p>2 invalid command syntax</p>

<p>15 can&acute;t find the shadow password file</p>

<p>SEE ALSO passwd(5), shadow(5).</p>
