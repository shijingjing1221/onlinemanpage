<p>NAME ppmntsc - Make RGB colors legal for NTSC or PAL
color systems.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ppmntsc</p>

<p>[--pal] [--legalonly] [--illegalonly] [--correctedonly]
[--verbose] [--debug] [infile]</p>

<p>Minimum unique abbreviations of options are
acceptable.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>This program makes colors legal in the NTSC (or PAL)
color systems. Often, images generated on the computer are
made for use in movies which ultimately end up on a
television screen. However, the range of colors (as
specified by their RGB values) on a computer does not match
the range of colors that can be represented using the NTSC
(or PAL) systems. If an image with illegal colors is sent
directly to an NTSC (or PAL) video system for recording, the
illegal colors will be clipped. This may result in an
undesirable looking picture.</p>

<p>This utility tests each pixel in an image to see if it
falls within the legal NTSC (or PAL) range. If not, it
raises or lowers the pixels saturation in the output so that
it does fall within legal limits. Pixels that are already OK
just go unmodified into the output.</p>

<p>Input is from the file named input. If input is -, input
is from Stan- dard Input. If you dont specify input, input
is from Standard Input.</p>

<p>Output is always to Standard Output.</p>

<p>This program handles multi-image PPM input, producing
multi-image PPM output.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --pal Use the PAL transform instead of the
default NTSC.</p>

<p>--verbose Print a grand total of the number of illegal
pixels.</p>

<p>--debug Produce a humongous listing of illegal colors
and their legal counterparts. NOTE: This option may produce
a great deal of output.</p>

<p>--legalonly Output only pixels that are already legal.
Output black in place of pixels that are not.</p>

<p>--illegalonly Output only pixels that are illegal (and
output them uncor- rected). Output black in place of pixels
that are already legal.</p>

<p>--correctedonly Output only pixels that are corrected
versions of illegal pix- els. Output black in place of
pixels that are already legal.</p>
