<p>NAME pamfixtrunc - repair a Netpbm image whose file is
truncated</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pamfixtrunc</p>

<p>[-verbose]</p>

<p>[netpbmfile]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pamfixtrunc reads as much as it can of a Netpbm image
that may be trun- cated (i.e. the file may not contain the
last part of the image) and writes out a valid Netpbm image
that is just missing the bottom rows of the original
(pre-truncation) image.</p>

<p>The header of a Netpbm image implies how large the image
must be (how many bytes the file must contain). If the file
is actually smaller than that, a Netpbm program that tries
to read the image fails, with an error message telling you
that it couldnt read the whole file. The data in the file is
arranged in row order, from top to bottom, and the most
common reason for the file being smaller than its header
says it should be is because the bottommost rows are simply
missing. So pam- fixtrunc assumes that is the case and
generates a new image with just the rows that are readable.
(technically, that means the outputs header indicates a
smaller number of rows and omits any partial last row).</p>

<p>The most common way for a Netpbm file to be small is
that something interrupted the program that generated it
before it was finished writ- ing the file. For example, the
program ran out of its own input or encountered a bug or ran
out of space in which to write the output.</p>

<p>Another problem pamfixtrunc deals with is where the file
isnt actually too small, but due to a system error, a byte
in the middle of it cannot be read (think of a disk storage
failure). pamfixtrunc reads the input sequentially until it
can t read any further, for any reason. So it treats such an
image as a truncated one, ignoring all data after the
unreadable byte.</p>

<p>But be aware that an image file is sometimes too small
because of a bug in the program that generated it, and in
that case it is not simply a matter of the bottom of the
image missing, so pamfixtrunc simply cre- ates a valid
Netpbm image containing a garbage picture.</p>

<p>pamfixtrunc looks at only on the first image in a
multi-image stream.</p>

<p>If you want to test an image file to see if it is
corrupted by being too small, use pamfile --allimages . It
fails with an error message if the file is too small.</p>

<p>If you want to cut the bottom off a valid Netpbm image,
use pamcut.</p>
