<p>sane-sceptre(5) SANE Scanner Access Now Easy
sane-sceptre(5)</p>

<p>NAME sane-sceptre - SANE backend for SCEPTRE
scanners</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sane-sceptre library implements a SANE
(Scanner Access Now Easy) backend that provides access to
Sceptre flatbed scanners. This backend should be considered
beta-quality software! Please report any strange behavior to
the maintainer of the backend or to the SANE mailing
list.</p>

<p>At present, only one scanner is known to work with this
backend:</p>

<p>Model Connection Type ---------------------------
------------------- Sceptre VividScan S1200 SCSI</p>

<p>The make of this scanner is KINPO, so other scanners
from that manufac- turer may also work (eg. the S600).</p>

<p>OPTIONS The options the backend supports can either be
selected through command line options to programs like
scanimage or through GUI elements in xscanimage or
xsane.</p>

<p>Valid command line options and their syntax can be
listed by using scanimage --help -d sceptre</p>

<p>Scan Mode</p>

<p>--mode selects the basic mode of operation of the
scanner valid choices are Lineart, Halftone, Gray and Color.
The Lineart and Halftone mode are black and white only (1
bit). Gray will produce 256 levels of gray (8 bits). Color
will produce a 24 bits color image. The scanner supports 30
bits internally but it only exports 24.</p>

<p>--resolution selects the resolution for a scan. The
scanner can do several resolutions between 50 and 1200.</p>

<p>--halftone-pattern selects the pattern mode that is used
in Halftone mode. Valid options are 1, 2, 3 and 4.</p>

<p>--gamma-correction controls the scanner internal gamma
correction. Valid options are &quot;Default&quot;,
&quot;User defined&quot;, &quot;High density printing&quot;
&quot;Low den- sity printing&quot; and &quot;High contrast
printing&quot;.</p>

<p>--custom-gamma (color mode only) allows the user to
specify a gamma table (see the next 3 parameters).</p>

<p>--red-gamma-table (color mode only) can be used to
download a user defined gamma table for the red channel. The
table must be 256 bytes long.</p>

<p>--green-gamma-table (color mode only) can be used to
download a user defined gamma table for the green channel.
The table must be 256 bytes long.</p>

<p>--blue-gamma-table (color mode only) can be used to
download a user defined gamma table for the blue channel.
The table must be 256 bytes long.</p>

<p>--threshold sets the threshold for black and white
pixels in lineart mode. Possible values are from 0 (darker)
to 255 (lighter).</p>

<p>--preview requests a preview scan. The resolution used
for that scan is 30 dpi and the scan area is the maximum
allowed. The scan mode is user selected. The default is
&quot;no&quot;.</p>

<p>The geometry options</p>

<p>-l -t -x -y control the scan area: -l sets the top left
x coordinate, -t the top left y coordinate, -x selects the
width and -y the height of the scan area. All parameters are
specified in millimeters by default.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION FILE The configuration file
/etc/sane.d/sceptre.conf supports only one information: the
device name to use (eg /dev/scanner).</p>

<p>FILES /usr/lib64/sane/libsane-sceptre.a The static
library implementing this backend.</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-sceptre.so The shared library
implementing this backend (present on systems that support
dynamic loading).</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT SANE_DEBUG_SCEPTRE If the library was
compiled with debug support enabled, this environment
variable controls the debug level for this backend. E.g., a
value of 128 requests all debug output to be printed.
Smaller levels reduce verbosity.</p>

<p>LIMITATIONS Resolutions The windows TWAIN driver can be
set to any resolution between 50 to 1200 (excluding software
interpolation). This backend cannot. Only a handful of
resolution are available, although they should be numerous
enough.</p>

<p>BUGS None known.</p>
