<p>NAME vfs_streams_depot - EXPERIMENTAL module to store
alternate data streams in a central directory.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS vfs objects = streams_depot</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This EXPERIMENTAL VFS module is part of the
samba(7) suite.</p>

<p>The vfs_streams_depot enables storing of NTFS alternate
data streams in the file system. As a normal posix file
system does not support the concept of multiple data streams
per file, the streams_depot module stores the data in files
in a separate directory.</p>

<p>OPTIONS streams_depot:directory = PATH Path of the
directory where the alternate data streams should be stored.
Defaults to the sharepath/.streams.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES [share] vfs objects = streams_depot</p>

<p>AUTHOR The original Samba software and related utilities
were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by
the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way
the Linux kernel is developed.</p>
