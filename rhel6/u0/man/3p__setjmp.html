<p>_LONGJMP(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual _LONGJMP(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME _longjmp, _setjmp - non-local goto</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;setjmp.h&gt;</p>

<p>void _longjmp(jmp_buf env, int val); int _setjmp(jmp_buf
env);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The _longjmp() and _setjmp() functions shall
be equivalent to longjmp() and setjmp(), respectively, with
the additional restriction that _longjmp() and _setjmp()
shall not manipulate the signal mask.</p>

<p>If _longjmp() is called even though env was never
initialized by a call to _setjmp(), or when the last such
call was in a function that has since returned, the results
are undefined.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Refer to longjmp() and setjmp().</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE If _longjmp() is executed and the
environment in which _setjmp() was executed no longer
exists, errors can occur. The conditions under which the
environment of the _setjmp() no longer exists include
exiting the function that contains the _setjmp() call, and
exiting an inner block with temporary storage. This
condition might not be detectable, in which case the
_longjmp() occurs and, if the environment no longer exists,
the contents of the temporary storage of an inner block are
unpredictable. This condition might also cause unexpected
process ter- mination. If the function has returned, the
results are undefined.</p>

<p>Passing longjmp() a pointer to a buffer not created by
setjmp(), pass- ing _longjmp() a pointer to a buffer not
created by _setjmp(), passing siglongjmp() a pointer to a
buffer not created by sigsetjmp(), or pass- ing any of these
three functions a buffer that has been modified by the user
can cause all the problems listed above, and more.</p>

<p>The _longjmp() and _setjmp() functions are included to
support programs written to historical system interfaces.
New applications should use siglongjmp() and sigsetjmp()
respectively.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS The _longjmp() and _setjmp() functions
may be marked LEGACY in a future version.</p>
