<p>XkbUpdateMapFromCore(3) XKB FUNCTIONS
XkbUpdateMapFromCore(3)</p>

<p>NAME XkbUpdateMapFromCore - Update a local Xkb keyboard
map to reflect the mapping expressed by a core format
mapping</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS Bool XkbUpdateMapFromCore (XkbDescPtr xkb,
KeyCode first_key, int num_keys, int map_width, KeySym
*core_keysyms, XkbChangesPtr changes);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS - xkb keyboard description to update</p>

<p>- first_key keycode of first key description to
update</p>

<p>- num_keys number of key descriptions to update</p>

<p>- map_width width of core protocol keymap</p>

<p>- core_keysyms symbols in core protocol keymap</p>

<p>- changes backfilled with changes made to Xkb</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Xkb provides several functions that make it
easier to apply the compat- ibility map to configure a
client-side Xkb keyboard mapping, given a core protocol
representation of part or all of a keyboard mapping. Obtain
a core protocol representation of a keyboard mapping from an
actual server (by using XGetKeyboardMapping, for example), a
data file, or some other source.</p>

<p>XkbUpdateMapFromCore interprets input argument
information representing a keyboard map in core format to
update the Xkb keyboard description passed in xkb. Only a
portion of the Xkb map is updated - the portion
corresponding to keys with keycodes in the range first_key
through first_key + num_keys - 1. If XkbUpdateMapFromCore is
being called in response to a MappingNotify event, first_key
and num_keys are reported in the MappingNotify event.
core_keysyms contains the keysyms corre- sponding to the
keycode range being updated, in core keyboard descrip- tion
order. map_width is the number of keysyms per key in
core_keysyms. Thus, the first map_width entries in
core_keysyms are for the key with keycode first_key, the
next map_width entries are for key first_key + 1, and so
on.</p>

<p>In addition to modifying the Xkb keyboard mapping in
xkb, XkbUp- dateMapFromCore backfills the changes structure
whose address is passed in changes to indicate the
modifications that were made. You may then use changes in
subsequent calls such as XkbSetMap, to propagate the local
modifications to a server.</p>
