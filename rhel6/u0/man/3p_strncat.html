<p>STRNCAT(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual STRNCAT(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME strncat - concatenate a string with part of
another</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;string.h&gt;</p>

<p>char *strncat(char *restrict s1, const char *restrict
s2, size_t n);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The strncat() function shall append not more
than n bytes (a null byte and bytes that follow it are not
appended) from the array pointed to by s2 to the end of the
string pointed to by s1. The initial byte of s2 overwrites
the null byte at the end of s1. A terminating null byte is
always appended to the result. If copying takes place
between objects that overlap, the behavior is undefined.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The strncat() function shall return s1; no
return value shall be reserved to indicate an error.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
