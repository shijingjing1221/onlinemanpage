<p>PTHREAD_GETSCHEDPARAM(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
PTHREAD_GETSCHEDPARAM(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME pthread_getschedparam, pthread_setschedparam -
dynamic thread schedul- ing parameters access (REALTIME
THREADS)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;</p>

<p>int pthread_getschedparam(pthread_t thread, int
*restrict policy, struct sched_param *restrict param); int
pthread_setschedparam(pthread_t thread, int policy, const
struct sched_param *param);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pthread_getschedparam() and
pthread_setschedparam() functions shall, respectively, get
and set the scheduling policy and parameters of individual
threads within a multi-threaded process to be retrieved and
set. For SCHED_FIFO and SCHED_RR, the only required member
of the sched_param structure is the priority sched_priority.
For SCHED_OTHER, the affected scheduling parameters are
implementation-defined.</p>

<p>The pthread_getschedparam() function shall retrieve the
scheduling pol- icy and scheduling parameters for the thread
whose thread ID is given by thread and shall store those
values in policy and param, respec- tively. The priority
value returned from pthread_getschedparam() shall be the
value specified by the most recent pthread_setschedparam(),
pthread_setschedprio(), or pthread_create() call affecting
the target thread. It shall not reflect any temporary
adjustments to its priority as a result of any priority
inheritance or ceiling functions. The
pthread_setschedparam() function shall set the scheduling
policy and associated scheduling parameters for the thread
whose thread ID is given by thread to the policy and
associated parameters provided in policy and param,
respectively.</p>

<p>The policy parameter may have the value SCHED_OTHER,
SCHED_FIFO, or SCHED_RR. The scheduling parameters for the
SCHED_OTHER policy are implementation-defined. The
SCHED_FIFO and SCHED_RR policies shall have a single
scheduling parameter, priority.</p>

<p>If _POSIX_THREAD_SPORADIC_SERVER is defined, then the
policy argument may have the value SCHED_SPORADIC, with the
exception for the pthread_setschedparam() function that if
the scheduling policy was not SCHED_SPORADIC at the time of
the call, it is implementation-defined whether the function
is supported; in other words, the implementation need not
allow the application to dynamically change the scheduling
policy to SCHED_SPORADIC. The sporadic server scheduling
policy has the associated parameters sched_ss_low_priority,
sched_ss_repl_period, sched_ss_init_budget, sched_priority,
and sched_ss_max_repl. The speci- fied sched_ss_repl_period
shall be greater than or equal to the speci- fied
sched_ss_init_budget for the function to succeed; if it is
not, then the function shall fail. The value of
sched_ss_max_repl shall be within the inclusive range [1,
{SS_REPL_MAX}] for the function to suc- ceed; if not, the
function shall fail.</p>

<p>If the pthread_setschedparam() function fails, the
scheduling parame- ters shall not be changed for the target
thread.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE If successful, the pthread_getschedparam()
and pthread_setschedparam() functions shall return zero;
otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate the
error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The pthread_getschedparam() function may fail
if:</p>

<p>ESRCH The value specified by thread does not refer to an
existing thread.</p>

<p>The pthread_setschedparam() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The value specified by policy or one of the
scheduling parame- ters associated with the scheduling
policy policy is invalid.</p>

<p>ENOTSUP An attempt was made to set the policy or
scheduling parameters to an unsupported value.</p>

<p>ENOTSUP An attempt was made to dynamically change the
scheduling policy to SCHED_SPORADIC, and the implementation
does not support this change.</p>

<p>EPERM The caller does not have the appropriate
permission to set either the scheduling parameters or the
scheduling policy of the specified thread.</p>

<p>EPERM The implementation does not allow the application
to modify one of the parameters to the value specified.</p>

<p>ESRCH The value specified by thread does not refer to a
existing thread.</p>

<p>These functions shall not return an error code of
[EINTR].</p>
