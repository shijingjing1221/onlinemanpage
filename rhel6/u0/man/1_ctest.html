<p>NAME ctest - Testing driver provided by CMake.</p>

<p>USAGE ctest [options]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The &quot;ctest&quot; executable is the
CMake test driver program. CMake-gener- ated build trees
created for projects that use the ENABLE_TESTING and
ADD_TEST commands have testing support. This program will
run the tests and report results.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -C &lt;cfg&gt;, --build-config &lt;cfg&gt;
Choose configuration to test.</p>

<p>Some CMake-generated build trees can have multiple build
config- urations in the same tree. This option can be used
to specify which one should be tested. Example
configurations are &quot;Debug&quot; and
&quot;Release&quot;.</p>

<p>-V,--verbose Enable verbose output from tests.</p>

<p>Test output is normally suppressed and only summary
information is displayed. This option will show all test
output.</p>

<p>-VV,--extra-verbose Enable more verbose output from
tests.</p>

<p>Test output is normally suppressed and only summary
information is displayed. This option will show even more
test output.</p>

<p>--debug Displaying more verbose internals of CTest.</p>

<p>This feature will result in large number of output that
is mostly useful for debugging dashboard problems.</p>

<p>-Q,--quiet Make ctest quiet.</p>

<p>This option will suppress all the output. The output log
file will still be generated if the --output-log is
specified. Options such as --verbose, --extra-verbose, and
--debug are ignored if --quiet is specified.</p>

<p>-O &lt;file&gt;, --output-log &lt;file&gt; Output to log
file</p>

<p>This option tells ctest to write all its output to a log
file.</p>

<p>-N,--show-only Disable actual execution of tests.</p>

<p>This option tells ctest to list the tests that would be
run but not actually run them. Useful in conjunction with
the -R and -E options.</p>

<p>-R &lt;regex&gt;, --tests-regex &lt;regex&gt; Run tests
matching regular expression.</p>

<p>This option tells ctest to run only the tests whose
names match the given regular expression.</p>

<p>-E &lt;regex&gt;, --exclude-regex &lt;regex&gt; Exclude
tests matching regular expression.</p>

<p>This option tells ctest to NOT run the tests whose names
match the given regular expression.</p>

<p>-D &lt;dashboard&gt;, --dashboard &lt;dashboard&gt;
Execute dashboard test</p>

<p>This option tells ctest to perform act as a Dart client
and per- form a dashboard test. All tests are
&lt;Mode&gt;&lt;Test&gt;, where Mode can be Experimental,
Nightly, and Continuous, and Test can be Start, Update,
Configure, Build, Test, Coverage, and Submit.</p>

<p>-M &lt;model&gt;, --test-model &lt;model&gt; Sets the
model for a dashboard</p>

<p>This option tells ctest to act as a Dart client where
the Test- Model can be Experimental, Nightly, and
Continuous. Combining -M and -T is similar to -D</p>

<p>-T &lt;action&gt;, --test-action &lt;action&gt; Sets the
dashboard action to perform</p>

<p>This option tells ctest to act as a Dart client and
perform some action such as start, build, test etc.
Combining -M and -T is similar to -D</p>

<p>--track &lt;track&gt; Specify the track to submit
dashboard to</p>

<p>Submit dashboard to specified track instead of default
one. By default, the dashboard is submitted to Nightly,
Experimental, or Continuous track, but by specifying this
option, the track can be arbitrary.</p>

<p>-S &lt;script&gt;, --script &lt;script&gt; Execute a
dashboard for a configuration</p>

<p>This option tells ctest to load in a configuration
script which sets a number of parameters such as the binary
and source direc- tories. Then ctest will do what is
required to create and run a dashboard. This option
basically sets up a dashboard and then runs ctest -D with
the appropriate options.</p>

<p>-SP &lt;script&gt;, --script-new-process &lt;script&gt;
Execute a dashboard for a configuration</p>

<p>This option does the same operations as -S but it will
do them in a seperate process. This is primarily useful in
cases where the script may modify the environment and you do
not want the modified enviroment to impact other -S
scripts.</p>

<p>-A &lt;file&gt;, --add-notes &lt;file&gt; Add a notes
file with submission</p>

<p>This option tells ctest to include a notes file when
submitting dashboard.</p>

<p>-I [Start,End,Stride,test#,test#|Test file],
--tests-information Run a specific number of tests by
number.</p>

<p>This option causes ctest to run tests starting at number
Start, ending at number End, and incrementing by Stride. Any
additional numbers after Stride are considered individual
test numbers. Start, End,or stride can be empty. Optionally
a file can be given that contains the same syntax as the
command line.</p>

<p>-U, --union Take the Union of -I and -R</p>

<p>When both -R and -I are specified by default the
intersection of tests are run. By specifying -U the union of
tests is run instead.</p>

<p>--interactive-debug-mode [0|1] Set the interactive mode
to 0 or 1.</p>

<p>This option causes ctest to run tests in either an
interactive mode or a non-interactive mode. On Windows this
means that in non-interactive mode, all system debug pop up
windows are blocked. In dashboard mode (Experimental,
Nightly, Continuous), the default is non-interactive. When
just running tests not for a dashboard the default is to
allow popups and interactive debugging.</p>

<p>--build-and-test Configure, build and run a test.</p>

<p>This option tells ctest to configure (i.e. run cmake
on), build, and or execute a test. The configure and test
steps are optional. The arguments to this command line are
the source and binary directories. By default this will run
CMake on the Source/Bin directories specified unless
--build-nocmake is spec- ified. Both --build-makeprogram and
--build-generator MUST be provided to use --built-and-test.
If --test-command is specified then that will be run after
the build is complete. Other options that affect this mode
are --build-target --build-nocmake, --build-run-dir,
--build-two-config, --build-exe-dir,
--build-project,--build-noclean, --build-options</p>

<p>--build-target Specify a specific target to build.</p>

<p>This option goes with the --build-and-test option, if
left out the all target is built.</p>

<p>--build-nocmake Run the build without running cmake
first.</p>

<p>Skip the cmake step.</p>

<p>--build-run-dir Specify directory to run programs
from.</p>

<p>Directory where programs will be after it has been
compiled.</p>

<p>--build-two-config Run CMake twice</p>

<p>--build-exe-dir Specify the directory for the
executable.</p>

<p>--build-generator Specify the generator to use.</p>

<p>--build-project Specify the name of the project to
build.</p>

<p>--build-makeprogram Specify the make program to use.</p>

<p>--build-noclean Skip the make clean step.</p>

<p>--build-config-sample A sample executable to use to
determine the configuraiton</p>

<p>A sample executable to use to determine the
configuraiton that should be used. e.g.
Debug/Release/etc</p>

<p>--build-options Add extra options to the build step.</p>

<p>This option must be the last option with the exception
of --test-command</p>

<p>--test-command The test to run with the --build-and-test
option.</p>

<p>--test-timeout The time limit in seconds, internal use
only.</p>

<p>--tomorrow-tag Nightly or experimental starts with next
day tag.</p>

<p>This is useful if the build will not finish in one
day.</p>

<p>--ctest-config The configuration file used to initialize
CTest state when sub- mitting dashboards.</p>

<p>This option tells CTest to use different initialization
file instead of CTestConfiguration.tcl. This way multiple
initializa- tion files can be used for example to submit to
multiple dash- boards.</p>

<p>--overwrite Overwrite CTest configuration option.</p>

<p>By default ctest uses configuration options from
configuration file. This option will overwrite the
configuration option.</p>

<p>--extra-submit &lt;file&gt;[;&lt;file&gt;] Submit extra
files to the dashboard.</p>

<p>This option will submit extra files to the
dashboard.</p>

<p>--force-new-ctest-process Run child CTest instances as
new processes</p>

<p>By default CTest will run child CTest instances within
the same process. If this behavior is not desired, this
argument will enforce new processes for child CTest
processes.</p>

<p>--submit-index Submit individual dashboard tests with
specific index</p>

<p>This option allows performing the same CTest action
(such as test) multiple times and submit all stages to the
same dashboard (Dart2 required). Each execution requires
different index.</p>

<p>GENERATORS The following generators are available on
this platform:</p>

<p>COMMANDS break Break from an enclosing foreach or while
loop.</p>

<p>break()</p>

<p>Breaks from an enclosing foreach loop or while loop</p>

<p>build_name Deprecated. Use ${CMAKE_SYSTEM} and
${CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER} instead.</p>

<p>build_name(variable)</p>

<p>Sets the specified variable to a string representing the
plat- form and compiler settings. These values are now
available through the CMAKE_SYSTEM and CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER
variables.</p>

<p>cmake_minimum_required Set the minimum required version
of cmake for a project.</p>

<p>cmake_minimum_required(VERSION major[.minor[.patch]]
[FATAL_ERROR])</p>

<p>If the current version of CMake is lower than that
required it will stop processing the project and report an
error. When a version higher than 2.4 is specified the
command implicitly invokes</p>

<p>cmake_policy(VERSION major[.minor[.patch]])</p>

<p>which sets the cmake policy version level to the version
speci- fied. When version 2.4 or lower is given the command
implicitly invokes</p>

<p>cmake_policy(VERSION 2.4)</p>

<p>which enables compatibility features for CMake 2.4 and
lower.</p>

<p>The FATAL_ERROR option is accepted but ignored by CMake
2.6 and higher. It should be specified so CMake versions 2.4
and lower fail with an error instead of just a warning.</p>

<p>cmake_policy Manage CMake Policy settings.</p>

<p>As CMake evolves it is sometimes necessary to change
existing behavior in order to fix bugs or improve
implementations of existing features. The CMake Policy
mechanism is designed to help keep existing projects
building as new versions of CMake introduce changes in
behavior. Each new policy (behavioral change) is given an
identifier of the form &quot;CMP&lt;NNNN&gt;&quot; where
&quot;&lt;NNNN&gt;&quot; is an integer index. Documentation
associated with each policy describes the OLD and NEW
behavior and the reason the policy was introduced. Projects
may set each policy to select the desired behavior. When
CMake needs to know which behavior to use it checks for a
setting specified by the project. If no setting is available
the OLD behavior is assumed and a warning is produced
requesting that the policy be set.</p>

<p>The cmake_policy command is used to set policies to OLD
or NEW behavior. While setting policies individually is
supported, we encourage projects to set policies based on
CMake versions.</p>

<p>cmake_policy(VERSION major.minor[.patch])</p>

<p>Specify that the current CMake list file is written for
the given version of CMake. All policies introduced in the
speci- fied version or earlier will be set to use NEW
behavior. All policies introduced after the specified
version will be reset to use OLD behavior with a warning.
This effectively requests behavior preferred as of a given
CMake version and tells newer CMake versions to warn about
their new policies. The policy version specified must be at
least 2.4 or the command will report an error. In order to
get compatibility features sup- porting versions earlier
than 2.4 see documentation of policy CMP0001.</p>

<p>cmake_policy(SET CMP&lt;NNNN&gt; NEW) cmake_policy(SET
CMP&lt;NNNN&gt; OLD)</p>

<p>Tell CMake to use the OLD or NEW behavior for a given
policy. Projects depending on the old behavior of a given
policy may silence a policy warning by setting the policy
state to OLD. Alternatively one may fix the project to work
with the new behavior and set the policy state to NEW.</p>

<p>cmake_policy(GET CMP&lt;NNNN&gt; &lt;variable&gt;)</p>

<p>Check whether a given policy is set to OLD or NEW
behavior. The output variable value will be &quot;OLD&quot;
or &quot;NEW&quot; if the policy is set, and empty
otherwise.</p>

<p>CMake keeps policy settings on a stack, so changes made
by the cmake_policy command affect only the top of the
stack. A new entry on the policy stack is managed
automatically for each sub- directory to protect its parents
and siblings. CMake also man- ages a new entry for scripts
loaded by include() and find_pack- age() commands except
when invoked with the NO_POLICY_SCOPE option (see also
policy CMP0011). The cmake_policy command pro- vides an
interface to manage custom entries on the policy stack:</p>

<p>cmake_policy(PUSH) cmake_policy(POP)</p>

<p>Each PUSH must have a matching POP to erase any changes.
This is useful to make temporary changes to policy
settings.</p>

<p>Functions and macros record policy settings when they
are cre- ated and use the pre-record policies when they are
invoked. If the function or macro implementation sets
policies, the changes automatically propagate up through
callers until they reach the closest nested policy stack
entry.</p>

<p>configure_file Copy a file to another location and
modify its contents.</p>

<p>configure_file(InputFile OutputFile [COPYONLY]
[ESCAPE_QUOTES] [@ONLY])</p>

<p>The Input and Output files have to have full paths. This
com- mand replaces any variables in the input file
referenced as ${VAR} or @VAR@ with their values as
determined by CMake. If a variable is not defined, it will
be replaced with nothing. If COPYONLY is specified, then no
variable expansion will take place. If ESCAPE_QUOTES is
specified then any substituted quotes will be C-style
escaped. The file will be configured with the current values
of CMake variables. If @ONLY is speci- fied, only variables
of the form @VAR@ will be replaces and ${VAR} will be
ignored. This is useful for configuring scripts that use
${VAR}. Any occurrences of #cmakedefine VAR will be replaced
with either #define VAR or /* #undef VAR */ depending on the
setting of VAR in CMake</p>

<p>ctest_build Builds the repository.</p>

<p>ctest_build([BUILD build_dir] [RETURN_VALUE res])</p>

<p>Builds the given build directory and stores results in
Build.xml.</p>

<p>ctest_configure Configures the repository.</p>

<p>ctest_configure(BUILD build_dir RETURN_VALUE res)</p>

<p>ctest_run_script([NEW_PROCESS] script_file_name
script_file_name1 script_file_name2 ...)</p>

<p>Runs a script or scripts much like if it was run from
ctest -S. If no argument is provided then the current script
is run using the current settings of the variables. If
NEW_PROCESS is speci- fied then each script will be run in a
seperate process.</p>

<p>ctest_sleep sleeps for some amount of time</p>

<p>ctest_sleep( seconds ) ctest_sleep( time1 duration time2
)</p>

<p>With one argument it will sleep for a given number of
seconds. With three arguments it will wait for time2 - time1
- duration seconds.</p>

<p>ctest_start Starts the testing for a given model</p>

<p>ctest_start(Model [TRACK &lt;track&gt;] [source
[binary]])</p>

<p>Starts the testing for a given model. The command should
be called after the binary directory is initialized. If the
source and binary directory are not specified, it reads the
CTEST_SOURCE_DIRECTORY and CTEST_BINARY_DIRECTORY. If the
track is specified, the submissions will go to the specified
track.</p>

<p>ctest_submit Submits the repository.</p>

<p>ctest_submit([RETURN_VALUE res])</p>

for tests to run INCLUDE, or a reg- ular expression for
tests to not run EXCLUDE.</p>

<p>ctest_update Updates the repository.</p>

<p>ctest_update([SOURCE source] [RETURN_VALUE res])</p>

<p>See the macro command.</p>

<p>endwhile Ends a list of commands in a while block.</p>

<p>endwhile(expression)</p>

<p>See the while command.</p>

<p>exec_program Deprecated. Use the execute_process()
command instead.</p>

<p>Run an executable program during the processing of the
CMake- List.txt file.</p>

<p>exec_program(Executable [directory in which to run]
[ARGS &lt;arguments to executable&gt;] [OUTPUT_VARIABLE
&lt;var&gt;] [RETURN_VALUE &lt;var&gt;])</p>

<p>The executable is run in the optionally specified
directory. The executable can include arguments if it is
double quoted, but it is better to use the optional ARGS
argument to specify argu- ments to the program. This is
because cmake will then be able to escape spaces in the
executable path. An optional argument OUTPUT_VARIABLE
specifies a variable in which to store the out- put. To
capture the return value of the execution, provide a
RETURN_VALUE. If OUTPUT_VARIABLE is specified, then no
output will go to the stdout/stderr of the console running
cmake.</p>

<p>execute_process Execute one or more child processes.</p>

<p>execute_process(COMMAND &lt;cmd1&gt; [args1...]]
[COMMAND &lt;cmd2&gt; [args2...] [...]] [WORKING_DIRECTORY
&lt;directory&gt;] [TIMEOUT &lt;seconds&gt;]
[RESULT_VARIABLE &lt;variable&gt;] [OUTPUT_VARIABLE
&lt;variable&gt;] [ERROR_VARIABLE &lt;variable&gt;]
[INPUT_FILE &lt;file&gt;] [OUTPUT_FILE &lt;file&gt;]
[ERROR_FILE &lt;file&gt;] [OUTPUT_QUIET] [ERROR_QUIET]
[OUTPUT_STRIP_TRAILING_WHITESPACE]
[ERROR_STRIP_TRAILING_WHITESPACE])</p>

<p>Runs the given sequence of one or more commands with the
stan- dard output of each process piped to the standard
input of the next. A single standard error pipe is used for
all processes. If WORKING_DIRECTORY is given the named
directory will be set as the current working directory of
the child processes. If TIME- OUT is given the child
processes will be terminated if they do not finish in the
specified number of seconds (fractions are allowed). If
RESULT_VARIABLE is given the variable will be set to contain
the result of running the processes. This will be an integer
return code from the last child or a string describing an
error condition. If OUTPUT_VARIABLE or ERROR_VARIABLE are
given the variable named will be set with the contents of
the standard output and standard error pipes respectively.
If the same variable is named for both pipes their output
will be merged in the order produced. If INPUT_FILE,
OUTPUT_FILE, or ERROR_FILE is given the file named will be
attached to the stan- dard input of the first process,
standard output of the last process, or standard error of
all processes respectively. If OUTPUT_QUIET or ERROR_QUIET
is given then the standard output or standard error results
will be quietly ignored. If more than one OUTPUT_* or
ERROR_* option is given for the same pipe the precedence is
not specified. If no OUTPUT_* or ERROR_* options are given
the output will be shared with the corresponding pipes of
the CMake process itself.</p>

<p>The execute_process command is a newer more powerful
version of exec_program, but the old command has been kept
for compatibil- ity.</p>

<p>file File manipulation command.</p>

<p>file(WRITE filename &quot;message to write&quot;... )
file(APPEND filename &quot;message to write&quot;... )
file(READ filename variable [LIMIT numBytes] [OFFSET offset]
[HEX]) file(STRINGS filename variable [LIMIT_COUNT num]
[LIMIT_INPUT numBytes] [LIMIT_OUTPUT numBytes]
[LENGTH_MINIMUM numBytes] [LENGTH_MAXIMUM numBytes]
[NEWLINE_CONSUME] [REGEX regex] [NO_HEX_CONVERSION])
file(GLOB variable [RELATIVE path] [globbing
expressions]...) file(GLOB_RECURSE variable [RELATIVE path]
[FOLLOW_SYMLINKS] [globbing expressions]...) file(REMOVE
[file1 ...]) file(REMOVE_RECURSE [file1 ...])
file(MAKE_DIRECTORY [directory1 directory2 ...])
file(RELATIVE_PATH variable directory file)
file(TO_CMAKE_PATH path result) file(TO_NATIVE_PATH path
result) file(DOWNLOAD url file [TIMEOUT timeout] [STATUS
status] [LOG log])</p>

<p>WRITE will write a message into a file called filename.
It overwrites the file if it already exists, and creates the
file if it does not exist.</p>

<p>APPEND will write a message into a file same as WRITE,
except it will append it to the end of the file</p>

<p>READ will read the content of a file and store it into
the vari- able. It will start at the given offset and read
up to numBytes. If the argument HEX is given, the binary
data will be converted to hexadecimal representation and
this will be stored in the variable.</p>

<p>STRINGS will parse a list of ASCII strings from a file
and store it in a variable. Binary data in the file are
ignored. Carriage return (CR) characters are ignored. It
works also for Intel Hex and Motorola S-record files, which
are automatically converted to binary format when reading
them. Disable this using NO_HEX_CONVERSION.</p>

<p>LIMIT_COUNT sets the maximum number of strings to
return. LIMIT_INPUT sets the maximum number of bytes to read
from the input file. LIMIT_OUTPUT sets the maximum number of
bytes to store in the output variable. LENGTH_MINIMUM sets
the minimum length of a string to return. Shorter strings
are ignored. LENGTH_MAXIMUM sets the maximum length of a
string to return. Longer strings are split into strings no
longer than the maximum length. NEWLINE_CONSUME allows
newlines to be included in strings instead of terminating
them.</p>

<p>REGEX specifies a regular expression that a string must
match to be returned. Typical usage</p>

<p>file(STRINGS myfile.txt myfile)</p>

<p>stores a list in the variable &quot;myfile&quot; in
which each item is a line from the input file.</p>

<p>GLOB will generate a list of all files that match the
globbing expressions and store it into the variable.
Globbing expressions are similar to regular expressions, but
much simpler. If RELA- TIVE flag is specified for an
expression, the results will be returned as a relative path
to the given path.</p>

<p>Examples of globbing expressions include:</p>

<p>*.cxx - match all files with extension cxx *.vt? - match
all files with extension vta,...,vtz f[3-5].txt - match
files f3.txt, f4.txt, f5.txt</p>

<p>GLOB_RECURSE will generate a list similar to the regular
GLOB, except it will traverse all the subdirectories of the
matched directory and match the files. Subdirectories that
are symlinks are only traversed if FOLLOW_SYMLINKS is given
or cmake policy CMP0009 is not set to NEW. See cmake
--help-policy CMP0009 for more information.</p>

<p>Examples of recursive globbing include:</p>

<p>/dir/*.py - match all python files in /dir and
subdirectories</p>

<p>MAKE_DIRECTORY will create the given directories, also
if their parent directories dont exist yet</p>

<p>REMOVE will remove the given files, also in
subdirectories</p>

<p>REMOVE_RECURSE will remove the given files and
directories, also non-empty directories</p>

<p>RELATIVE_PATH will determine relative path from
directory to the given file.</p>

<p>TO_CMAKE_PATH will convert path into a cmake style path
with unix /. The input can be a single path or a system path
like &quot;$ENV{PATH}&quot;. Note the double quotes around
the ENV call TO_CMAKE_PATH only takes one argument.</p>

<p>TO_NATIVE_PATH works just like TO_CMAKE_PATH, but will
convert from a cmake style path into the native path style
for win- dows and / for UNIX.</p>

<p>DOWNLOAD will download the given URL to the given file.
If LOG var is specified a log of the download will be put in
var. If STATUS var is specified the status of the operation
will be put in var. The status is returned in a list of
length 2. The first element is the numeric return value for
the operation, and the second element is a string value for
the error. A 0 numeric error means no error in the
operation. If TIMEOUT time is speci- fied, the operation
will timeout after time seconds, time can be specified as a
float.</p>

<p>find_file Find the full path to a file.</p>

<p>find_path(&lt;VAR&gt; name1 [path1 path2 ...])</p>

<p>This is the short-hand signature for the command that is
suffi- cient in many cases. It is the same as
find_path(&lt;VAR&gt; name1 [PATHS path1 path2 ...])</p>

<p>find_path( &lt;VAR&gt; name | NAMES name1 [name2 ...]
[HINTS path1 [path2 ... ENV var]] [PATHS path1 [path2 ...
ENV var]] [PATH_SUFFIXES suffix1 [suffix2 ...]] [DOC
&quot;cache documentation string&quot;] [NO_DEFAULT_PATH]
[NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH] [NO_CMAKE_PATH]
[NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH] [NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH]
[CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH | ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH |
NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH] )</p>

<p>This command is used to find a full path to named file.
A cache entry named by &lt;VAR&gt; is created to store the
result of this com- mand. If the full path to a file is
found the result is stored in the variable and the search
will not be repeated unless the variable is cleared. If
nothing is found, the result will be &lt;VAR&gt;-NOTFOUND,
and the search will be attempted again the next time
find_path is invoked with the same variable. The name of the
full path to a file that is searched for is specified by the
names listed after the NAMES argument. Additional search
loca- tions can be specified after the PATHS argument. If
ENV var is found in the HINTS or PATHS section the
environment variable var will be read and converted from a
system environment variable to a cmake style list of paths.
For example ENV PATH would be a way to list the system path
variable. The argument after DOC will be used for the
documentation string in the cache. PATH_SUFFIXES specifies
additional subdirectories to check below each search
path.</p>

<p>If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is specified, then no additional
paths are added to the search. If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is not
specified, the search process is as follows:</p>

<p>1. Search paths specified in cmake-specific cache
variables. These are intended to be used on the command line
with a -DVAR=value. This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_PATH is
passed.</p>

<p>&lt;prefix&gt;/include for each &lt;prefix&gt; in
CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH
CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH</p>

<p>2. Search paths specified in cmake-specific environment
vari- ables. These are intended to be set in the user s
shell config- uration. This can be skipped if
NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is passed.</p>

<p>&lt;prefix&gt;/include for each &lt;prefix&gt; in
CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH
CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH</p>

<p>3. Search the paths specified by the HINTS option. These
should be paths computed by system introspection, such as a
hint pro- vided by the location of another item already
found. Hard-coded guesses should be specified with the PATHS
option.</p>

<p>4. Search the standard system environment variables.
This can be skipped if NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is an
argument.</p>

<p>PATH INCLUDE</p>

<p>5. Search cmake variables defined in the Platform files
for the current system. This can be skipped if
NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH is passed.</p>

<p>&lt;prefix&gt;/include for each &lt;prefix&gt; in
CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH
CMAKE_SYSTEM_FRAMEWORK_PATH</p>

<p>6. Search the paths specified by the PATHS option or in
the short-hand version of the command. These are typically
hard-coded guesses.</p>

<p>On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Frameworks, the
cmake vari- able CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK can be set to empty or
one of the following:</p>

<p>&quot;FIRST&quot; - Try to find frameworks before
standard libraries or headers. This is the default on
Darwin. &quot;LAST&quot; - Try to find frameworks after
standard libraries or headers. &quot;ONLY&quot; - Only try
to find frameworks. &quot;NEVER&quot;. - Never try to find
frameworks.</p>

<p>On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Application
Bundles, the cmake variable CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE can be set
to empty or one of the following:</p>

<p>&quot;FIRST&quot; - Try to find application bundles
before standard programs. This is the default on Darwin.
&quot;LAST&quot; - Try to find application bundles after
standard programs. &quot;ONLY&quot; - Only try to find
application bundles. &quot;NEVER&quot;. - Never try to find
application bundles.</p>

<p>The CMake variable CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH specifies one or
more directories to be prepended to all other search
directories. This effectively &quot;re-roots&quot; the
entire search under given loca- tions. By default it is
empty. It is especially useful when cross-compiling to point
to the root directory of the target environment and CMake
will search there too. By default at first the directories
listed in CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH and then the non-rooted
directories will be searched. The default behavior can be
adjusted by setting CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_INCLUDE. This
behavior can be manually overridden on a per-call basis. By
using CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH the search order will be as
described above. If NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then
CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH will not be used. If
ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then only the re-rooted
direc- tories will be searched.</p>

<p>The default search order is designed to be most-specific
to least-specific for common use cases. Projects may
override the order by simply calling the command multiple
times and using the NO_* options:</p>

<p>find_path(&lt;VAR&gt; NAMES name PATHS paths...
NO_DEFAULT_PATH) find_path(&lt;VAR&gt; NAMES name)</p>

<p>Once one of the calls succeeds the result variable will
be set and stored in the cache so that no call will search
again.</p>

<p>find_library Find a library.</p>

<p>find_library(&lt;VAR&gt; name1 [path1 path2 ...])</p>

<p>This is the short-hand signature for the command that is
suffi- cient in many cases. It is the same as
find_library(&lt;VAR&gt; name1 [PATHS path1 path2 ...])</p>

<p>find_library( &lt;VAR&gt; name | NAMES name1 [name2 ...]
[HINTS path1 [path2 ... ENV var]] [PATHS path1 [path2 ...
ENV var]] [PATH_SUFFIXES suffix1 [suffix2 ...]] [DOC
&quot;cache documentation string&quot;] [NO_DEFAULT_PATH]
[NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH] [NO_CMAKE_PATH]
[NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH] [NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH]
[CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH | ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH |
NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH] )</p>

<p>This command is used to find a library. A cache entry
named by &lt;VAR&gt; is created to store the result of this
command. If the library is found the result is stored in the
variable and the search will not be repeated unless the
variable is cleared. If nothing is found, the result will be
&lt;VAR&gt;-NOTFOUND, and the search will be attempted again
the next time find_library is invoked with the same
variable. The name of the library that is searched for is
specified by the names listed after the NAMES argument.
Additional search locations can be specified after the PATHS
argument. If ENV var is found in the HINTS or PATHS section
the environment variable var will be read and converted from
a system environment variable to a cmake style list of
paths. For example ENV PATH would be a way to list the
system path variable. The argument after DOC will be used
for the docu- mentation string in the cache. PATH_SUFFIXES
specifies addi- tional subdirectories to check below each
search path.</p>

<p>If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is specified, then no additional
paths are added to the search. If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is not
specified, the search process is as follows:</p>

<p>1. Search paths specified in cmake-specific cache
variables. These are intended to be used on the command line
with a -DVAR=value. This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_PATH is
passed.</p>

<p>&lt;prefix&gt;/lib for each &lt;prefix&gt; in
CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH
CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH</p>

<p>2. Search paths specified in cmake-specific environment
vari- ables. These are intended to be set in the user s
shell config- uration. This can be skipped if
NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is passed.</p>

<p>&lt;prefix&gt;/lib for each &lt;prefix&gt; in
CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH
CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH</p>

<p>3. Search the paths specified by the HINTS option. These
should be paths computed by system introspection, such as a
hint pro- vided by the location of another item already
found. Hard-coded guesses should be specified with the PATHS
option.</p>

<p>4. Search the standard system environment variables.
This can be skipped if NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is an
argument.</p>

<p>PATH LIB</p>

<p>5. Search cmake variables defined in the Platform files
for the current system. This can be skipped if
NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH is passed.</p>

<p>&lt;prefix&gt;/lib for each &lt;prefix&gt; in
CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH
CMAKE_SYSTEM_FRAMEWORK_PATH</p>

<p>6. Search the paths specified by the PATHS option or in
the short-hand version of the command. These are typically
hard-coded guesses.</p>

<p>On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Frameworks, the
cmake vari- able CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK can be set to empty or
one of the following:</p>

<p>&quot;FIRST&quot; - Try to find frameworks before
standard libraries or headers. This is the default on
Darwin. &quot;LAST&quot; - Try to find frameworks after
standard libraries or headers. &quot;ONLY&quot; - Only try
to find frameworks. &quot;NEVER&quot;. - Never try to find
frameworks.</p>

<p>On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Application
Bundles, the cmake variable CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE can be set
to empty or one of the following:</p>

<p>&quot;FIRST&quot; - Try to find application bundles
before standard programs. This is the default on Darwin.
&quot;LAST&quot; - Try to find application bundles after
standard programs. &quot;ONLY&quot; - Only try to find
application bundles. &quot;NEVER&quot;. - Never try to find
application bundles.</p>

<p>The CMake variable CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH specifies one or
more directories to be prepended to all other search
directories. This effectively &quot;re-roots&quot; the
entire search under given loca- tions. By default it is
empty. It is especially useful when cross-compiling to point
to the root directory of the target environment and CMake
will search there too. By default at first the directories
listed in CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH and then the non-rooted
directories will be searched. The default behavior can be
adjusted by setting CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_LIBRARY. This
behavior can be manually overridden on a per-call basis. By
using CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH the search order will be as
described above. If NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then
CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH will not be used. If
ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then only the re-rooted
direc- tories will be searched.</p>

<p>The default search order is designed to be most-specific
to least-specific for common use cases. Projects may
override the order by simply calling the command multiple
times and using the NO_* options:</p>

<p>find_library(&lt;VAR&gt; NAMES name PATHS paths...
NO_DEFAULT_PATH) find_library(&lt;VAR&gt; NAMES name)</p>

<p>Once one of the calls succeeds the result variable will
be set and stored in the cache so that no call will search
again.</p>

<p>If the library found is a framework, then VAR will be
set to the full path to the framework
&lt;fullPath&gt;/A.framework. When a full path to a
framework is used as a library, CMake will use a -framework
A, and a -F&lt;fullPath&gt; to link the framework to the
target.</p>

<p>find_package Load settings for an external project.</p>

<p>find_package(&lt;package&gt; [version] [EXACT] [QUIET]
[[REQUIRED|COMPONENTS] [components...]]
[NO_POLICY_SCOPE])</p>

<p>Finds and loads settings from an external project.
&lt;pack- age&gt;_FOUND will be set to indicate whether the
package was found. When the package is found
package-specific information is provided through variables
documented by the package itself. The QUIET option disables
messages if the package cannot be found. The REQUIRED option
stops processing with an error mes- sage if the package
cannot be found. A package-specific list of components may
be listed after the REQUIRED option or after the COMPONENTS
option if no REQUIRED option is given. The [version]
argument requests a version with which the package found
should be compatible (format is
major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]]). The EXACT option requests
that the version be matched exactly. If no [version] is
given to a recursive invocation inside a find-module, the
[version] and EXACT arguments are forwarded automatically
from the outer call. Version support is currently provided
only on a package-by-package basis (details below).</p>

<p>User code should generally look for packages using the
above simple signature. The remainder of this command
documentation specifies the full command signature and
details of the search process. Project maintainers wishing
to provide a package to be found by this command are
encouraged to read on.</p>

<p>The command has two modes by which it searches for
packages: &quot;Module&quot; mode and &quot;Config&quot;
mode. Module mode is available when the command is invoked
with the above reduced signature. CMake searches for a file
called &quot;Find&lt;package&gt;.cmake&quot; in the
CMAKE_MODULE_PATH followed by the CMake installation. If the
file is found, it is read and processed by CMake. It is
respon- sible for finding the package, checking the version,
and produc- ing any needed messages. Many find-modules
provide limited or no support for versioning; check the
module documentation. If no module is found the command
proceeds to Config mode.</p>

<p>The complete Config mode command signature is:</p>

<p>find_package(&lt;package&gt; [version] [EXACT] [QUIET]
[[REQUIRED|COMPONENTS] [components...]] [NO_MODULE]
[NO_POLICY_SCOPE] [NAMES name1 [name2 ...]] [CONFIGS config1
[config2 ...]] [HINTS path1 [path2 ... ]] [PATHS path1
[path2 ... ]] [PATH_SUFFIXES suffix1 [suffix2 ...]]
[NO_DEFAULT_PATH] [NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
[NO_CMAKE_PATH] [NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
[NO_CMAKE_BUILDS_PATH] [NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH]
[CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH | ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH |
NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH])</p>

<p>The NO_MODULE option may be used to skip Module mode
explicitly. It is also implied by use of options not
specified in the reduced signature.</p>

<p>Config mode attempts to locate a configuration file
provided by the package to be found. A cache entry called
&lt;package&gt;_DIR is created to hold the directory
containing the file. By default the command searches for a
package with the name &lt;package&gt;. If the NAMES option
is given the names following it are used instead of
&lt;package&gt;. The command searches for a file called
&quot;&lt;name&gt;Config.cmake&quot; or
&quot;&lt;lower-case-name&gt;-config.cmake&quot; for each
name specified. A replacement set of possible configura-
tion file names may be given using the CONFIGS option. The
search procedure is specified below. Once found, the
configura- tion file is read and processed by CMake. Since
the file is provided by the package it already knows the
location of package contents. The full path to the
configuration file is stored in the cmake variable
&lt;package&gt;_CONFIG.</p>

<p>If the package configuration file cannot be found CMake
will generate an error describing the problem unless the
QUIET argument is specified. If REQUIRED is specified and
the package is not found a fatal error is generated and the
configure step stops executing. If &lt;package&gt;_DIR has
been set to a directory not containing a configuration file
CMake will ignore it and search from scratch.</p>

<p>When the [version] argument is given Config mode will
only find a version of the package that claims compatibility
with the requested version (format is
major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]]). If the EXACT option is given
only a version of the package claiming an exact match of the
requested version may be found. CMake does not establish any
convention for the meaning of version numbers. Package
version numbers are checked by &quot;version&quot; files
provided by the packages themselves. For a candidate package
confguration file &quot;&lt;config-file&gt;.cmake&quot; the
corresponding ver- sion file is located next to it and named
either &quot;&lt;con- fig-file&gt;-version.cmake&quot; or
&quot;&lt;config-file&gt;Version.cmake&quot;. If no such
version file is available then the configuration file is
assumed to not be compatible with any requested version.
When a version file is found it is loaded to check the
requested ver- sion number. The version file is loaded in a
nested scope in which the following variables have been
defined:</p>

<p>PACKAGE_FIND_NAME = the &lt;package&gt; name
PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION = full requested version string
PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_MAJOR = major version if requested,
else 0 PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_MINOR = minor version if
requested, else 0 PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_PATCH = patch version
if requested, else 0 PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_TWEAK = tweak
version if requested, else 0 PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_COUNT =
number of version components, 0 to 4</p>

<p>The version file checks whether it satisfies the
requested ver- sion and sets these variables:</p>

<p>PACKAGE_VERSION = full provided version string
PACKAGE_VERSION_EXACT = true if version is exact match
PACKAGE_VERSION_COMPATIBLE = true if version is compatible
PACKAGE_VERSION_UNSUITABLE = true if unsuitable as any
version</p>

<p>These variables are checked by the find_package command
to determine whether the configuration file provides an
acceptable version. They are not available after the
find_package call returns. If the version is acceptable the
following variables are set:</p>

<p>&lt;package&gt;_VERSION = full provided version string
&lt;package&gt;_VERSION_MAJOR = major version if provided,
else 0 &lt;package&gt;_VERSION_MINOR = minor version if
provided, else 0 &lt;package&gt;_VERSION_PATCH = patch
version if provided, else 0 &lt;package&gt;_VERSION_TWEAK =
tweak version if provided, else 0
&lt;package&gt;_VERSION_COUNT = number of version
components, 0 to 4</p>

<p>and the corresponding package configuration file is
loaded. When multiple package configuration files are
available whose version files claim compatibility with the
version requested it is unspecified which one is chosen. No
attempt is made to choose a highest or closest version
number.</p>

<p>Config mode provides an elaborate interface and search
proce- dure. Much of the interface is provided for
completeness and for use internally by find-modules loaded
by Module mode. Most user code should simply call</p>

<p>find_package(&lt;package&gt; [major[.minor]] [EXACT]
[REQUIRED|QUIET])</p>

<p>in order to find a package. Package maintainers
providing CMake package configuration files are encouraged
to name and install them such that the procedure outlined
below will find them with- out requiring use of additional
options.</p>

<p>CMake constructs a set of possible installation prefixes
for the package. Under each prefix several directories are
searched for a configuration file. The tables below show the
directories searched. Each entry is meant for installation
trees following Windows (W), UNIX (U), or Apple (A)
conventions.</p>

<p>&lt;prefix&gt;/ (W) &lt;prefix&gt;/(cmake|CMake)/ (W)
&lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;name&gt;*/ (W)
&lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;name&gt;*/(cmake|CMake)/ (W)
&lt;prefix&gt;/(share|lib)/cmake/&lt;name&gt;*/ (U)
&lt;prefix&gt;/(share|lib)/&lt;name&gt;*/ (U)
&lt;prefix&gt;/(share|lib)/&lt;name&gt;*/(cmake|CMake)/
(U)</p>

<p>On systems supporting OS X Frameworks and Application
Bundles the following directories are searched for
frameworks or bundles containing a configuration file:</p>

<p>&lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;name&gt;.framework/Resources/ (A)
&lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;name&gt;.framework/Resources/CMake/ (A)
&lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;name&gt;.framework/Versions/*/Resources/
(A)
&lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;name&gt;.framework/Versions/*/Resources/CMake/
(A) &lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;name&gt;.app/Contents/Resources/ (A)
&lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;name&gt;.app/Contents/Resources/CMake/
(A)</p>

<p>In all cases the &lt;name&gt; is treated as
case-insensitive and cor- responds to any of the names
specified (&lt;package&gt; or names given by NAMES). If
PATH_SUFFIXES is specified the suffixes are appended to each
(W) or (U) directory entry one-by-one.</p>

<p>This set of directories is intended to work in
cooperation with projects that provide configuration files
in their installation trees. Directories above marked with
(W) are intended for installations on Windows where the
prefix may point at the top of an applications installation
directory. Those marked with (U) are intended for
installations on UNIX platforms where the prefix is shared
by multiple packages. This is merely a conven- tion, so all
(W) and (U) directories are still searched on all platforms.
Directories marked with (A) are intended for instal- lations
on Apple platforms. The cmake variables CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK
and CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE determine the order of preference
as specified below.</p>

<p>The set of installation prefixes is constructed using
the fol- lowing steps. If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is specified all
NO_* options are enabled.</p>

<p>1. Search paths specified in cmake-specific cache
variables. These are intended to be used on the command line
with a -DVAR=value. This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_PATH is
passed.</p>

<p>CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH
CMAKE_APPBUNDLE_PATH</p>

<p>2. Search paths specified in cmake-specific environment
vari- ables. These are intended to be set in the users shell
config- uration. This can be skipped if
NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is passed.</p>

<p>CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH
CMAKE_APPBUNDLE_PATH</p>

<p>3. Search paths specified by the HINTS option. These
should be paths computed by system introspection, such as a
hint provided by the location of another item already found.
Hard-coded guesses should be specified with the PATHS
option.</p>

<p>4. Search the standard system environment variables.
This can be skipped if NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is passed.
Path entries ending in &quot;/bin&quot; or &quot;/sbin&quot;
are automatically converted to their parent directories.</p>

<p>PATH</p>

<p>5. Search project build trees recently configured in a
CMake GUI. This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_BUILDS_PATH is
passed. It is intended for the case when a user is building
multiple depen- dent projects one after another.</p>

<p>6. Search cmake variables defined in the Platform files
for the current system. This can be skipped if
NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH is passed.</p>

<p>CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH CMAKE_SYSTEM_FRAMEWORK_PATH
CMAKE_SYSTEM_APPBUNDLE_PATH</p>

<p>7. Search paths specified by the PATHS option. These are
typi- cally hard-coded guesses.</p>

<p>On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Frameworks, the
cmake vari- able CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK can be set to empty or
one of the following:</p>

<p>&quot;FIRST&quot; - Try to find frameworks before
standard libraries or headers. This is the default on
Darwin. &quot;LAST&quot; - Try to find frameworks after
standard libraries or headers. &quot;ONLY&quot; - Only try
to find frameworks. &quot;NEVER&quot;. - Never try to find
frameworks.</p>

<p>On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Application
Bundles, the cmake variable CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE can be set
to empty or one of the following:</p>

<p>&quot;FIRST&quot; - Try to find application bundles
before standard programs. This is the default on Darwin.
&quot;LAST&quot; - Try to find application bundles after
standard programs. &quot;ONLY&quot; - Only try to find
application bundles. &quot;NEVER&quot;. - Never try to find
application bundles.</p>

<p>The CMake variable CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH specifies one or
more directories to be prepended to all other search
directories. This effectively &quot;re-roots&quot; the
entire search under given loca- tions. By default it is
empty. It is especially useful when cross-compiling to point
to the root directory of the target environment and CMake
will search there too. By default at first the directories
listed in CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH and then the non-rooted
directories will be searched. The default behavior can be
adjusted by setting CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PACKAGE. This
behavior can be manually overridden on a per-call basis. By
using CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH the search order will be as
described above. If NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then
CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH will not be used. If
ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then only the re-rooted
direc- tories will be searched.</p>

<p>The default search order is designed to be most-specific
to least-specific for common use cases. Projects may
override the order by simply calling the command multiple
times and using the NO_* options:</p>

<p>find_package(&lt;package&gt; PATHS paths...
NO_DEFAULT_PATH) find_package(&lt;package&gt;)</p>

<p>Once one of the calls succeeds the result variable will
be set and stored in the cache so that no call will search
again.</p>

<p>See the cmake_policy() command documentation for
discussion of the NO_POLICY_SCOPE option.</p>

<p>find_path Find the directory containing a file.</p>

<p>find_path(&lt;VAR&gt; name1 [path1 path2 ...])</p>

<p>This is the short-hand signature for the command that is
suffi- cient in many cases. It is the same as
find_path(&lt;VAR&gt; name1 [PATHS path1 path2 ...])</p>

<p>find_path( &lt;VAR&gt; name | NAMES name1 [name2 ...]
[HINTS path1 [path2 ... ENV var]] [PATHS path1 [path2 ...
ENV var]] [PATH_SUFFIXES suffix1 [suffix2 ...]] [DOC
&quot;cache documentation string&quot;] [NO_DEFAULT_PATH]
[NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH] [NO_CMAKE_PATH]
[NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH] [NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH]
[CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH | ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH |
NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH] )</p>

<p>This command is used to find a directory containing the
named file. A cache entry named by &lt;VAR&gt; is created to
store the result of this command. If the file in a directory
is found the result is stored in the variable and the search
will not be repeated unless the variable is cleared. If
nothing is found, the result will be &lt;VAR&gt;-NOTFOUND,
and the search will be attempted again the next time
find_path is invoked with the same variable. The name of the
file in a directory that is searched for is specified by the
names listed after the NAMES argument. Additional search
locations can be specified after the PATHS argument. If ENV
var is found in the HINTS or PATHS section the environment
variable var will be read and converted from a sys- tem
environment variable to a cmake style list of paths. For
example ENV PATH would be a way to list the system path
vari- able. The argument after DOC will be used for the
documentation string in the cache. PATH_SUFFIXES specifies
additional subdi- rectories to check below each search
path.</p>

<p>If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is specified, then no additional
paths are added to the search. If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is not
specified, the search process is as follows:</p>

<p>1. Search paths specified in cmake-specific cache
variables. These are intended to be used on the command line
with a -DVAR=value. This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_PATH is
passed.</p>

<p>&lt;prefix&gt;/include for each &lt;prefix&gt; in
CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH
CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH</p>

<p>2. Search paths specified in cmake-specific environment
vari- ables. These are intended to be set in the users shell
config- uration. This can be skipped if
NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is passed.</p>

<p>&lt;prefix&gt;/include for each &lt;prefix&gt; in
CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH
CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH</p>

<p>3. Search the paths specified by the HINTS option. These
should be paths computed by system introspection, such as a
hint pro- vided by the location of another item already
found. Hard-coded guesses should be specified with the PATHS
option.</p>

<p>4. Search the standard system environment variables.
This can be skipped if NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is an
argument.</p>

<p>PATH INCLUDE</p>

<p>5. Search cmake variables defined in the Platform files
for the current system. This can be skipped if
NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH is passed.</p>

<p>&lt;prefix&gt;/include for each &lt;prefix&gt; in
CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH
CMAKE_SYSTEM_FRAMEWORK_PATH</p>

<p>6. Search the paths specified by the PATHS option or in
the short-hand version of the command. These are typically
hard-coded guesses.</p>

<p>On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Frameworks, the
cmake vari- able CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK can be set to empty or
one of the following:</p>

<p>&quot;FIRST&quot; - Try to find frameworks before
standard libraries or headers. This is the default on
Darwin. &quot;LAST&quot; - Try to find frameworks after
standard libraries or headers. &quot;ONLY&quot; - Only try
to find frameworks. &quot;NEVER&quot;. - Never try to find
frameworks.</p>

<p>On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Application
Bundles, the cmake variable CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE can be set
to empty or one of the following:</p>

<p>&quot;FIRST&quot; - Try to find application bundles
before standard programs. This is the default on Darwin.
&quot;LAST&quot; - Try to find application bundles after
standard programs. &quot;ONLY&quot; - Only try to find
application bundles. &quot;NEVER&quot;. - Never try to find
application bundles.</p>

<p>The CMake variable CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH specifies one or
more directories to be prepended to all other search
directories. This effectively &quot;re-roots&quot; the
entire search under given loca- tions. By default it is
empty. It is especially useful when cross-compiling to point
to the root directory of the target environment and CMake
will search there too. By default at first the directories
listed in CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH and then the non-rooted
directories will be searched. The default behavior can be
adjusted by setting CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_INCLUDE. This
behavior can be manually overridden on a per-call basis. By
using CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH the search order will be as
described above. If NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then
CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH will not be used. If
ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then only the re-rooted
direc- tories will be searched.</p>

<p>The default search order is designed to be most-specific
to least-specific for common use cases. Projects may
override the order by simply calling the command multiple
times and using the NO_* options:</p>

<p>find_path(&lt;VAR&gt; NAMES name PATHS paths...
NO_DEFAULT_PATH) find_path(&lt;VAR&gt; NAMES name)</p>

<p>Once one of the calls succeeds the result variable will
be set and stored in the cache so that no call will search
again.</p>

<p>When searching for frameworks, if the file is specified
as A/b.h, then the framework search will look for
A.framework/Head- ers/b.h. If that is found the path will be
set to the path to the framework. CMake will convert this to
the correct -F option to include the file.</p>

<p>find_program Find an executable program.</p>

<p>find_program(&lt;VAR&gt; name1 [path1 path2 ...])</p>

<p>This is the short-hand signature for the command that is
suffi- cient in many cases. It is the same as
find_program(&lt;VAR&gt; name1 [PATHS path1 path2 ...])</p>

<p>find_program( &lt;VAR&gt; name | NAMES name1 [name2 ...]
[HINTS path1 [path2 ... ENV var]] [PATHS path1 [path2 ...
ENV var]] [PATH_SUFFIXES suffix1 [suffix2 ...]] [DOC
&quot;cache documentation string&quot;] [NO_DEFAULT_PATH]
[NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH] [NO_CMAKE_PATH]
[NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH] [NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH]
[CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH | ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH |
NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH] )</p>

<p>This command is used to find a program. A cache entry
named by &lt;VAR&gt; is created to store the result of this
command. If the program is found the result is stored in the
variable and the search will not be repeated unless the
variable is cleared. If nothing is found, the result will be
&lt;VAR&gt;-NOTFOUND, and the search will be attempted again
the next time find_program is invoked with the same
variable. The name of the program that is searched for is
specified by the names listed after the NAMES argument.
Additional search locations can be specified after the PATHS
argument. If ENV var is found in the HINTS or PATHS section
the environment variable var will be read and converted from
a system environment variable to a cmake style list of
paths. For example ENV PATH would be a way to list the
system path variable. The argument after DOC will be used
for the docu- mentation string in the cache. PATH_SUFFIXES
specifies addi- tional subdirectories to check below each
search path.</p>

<p>If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is specified, then no additional
paths are added to the search. If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is not
specified, the search process is as follows:</p>

<p>1. Search paths specified in cmake-specific cache
variables. These are intended to be used on the command line
with a -DVAR=value. This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_PATH is
passed.</p>

<p>&lt;prefix&gt;/[s]bin for each &lt;prefix&gt; in
CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH
CMAKE_APPBUNDLE_PATH</p>

<p>2. Search paths specified in cmake-specific environment
vari- ables. These are intended to be set in the users shell
config- uration. This can be skipped if
NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is passed.</p>

<p>&lt;prefix&gt;/[s]bin for each &lt;prefix&gt; in
CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH
CMAKE_APPBUNDLE_PATH</p>

<p>3. Search the paths specified by the HINTS option. These
should be paths computed by system introspection, such as a
hint pro- vided by the location of another item already
found. Hard-coded guesses should be specified with the PATHS
option.</p>

<p>4. Search the standard system environment variables.
This can be skipped if NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is an
argument.</p>

<p>PATH</p>

<p>5. Search cmake variables defined in the Platform files
for the current system. This can be skipped if
NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH is passed.</p>

<p>&lt;prefix&gt;/[s]bin for each &lt;prefix&gt; in
CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROGRAM_PATH
CMAKE_SYSTEM_APPBUNDLE_PATH</p>

<p>6. Search the paths specified by the PATHS option or in
the short-hand version of the command. These are typically
hard-coded guesses.</p>

<p>On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Frameworks, the
cmake vari- able CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK can be set to empty or
one of the following:</p>

<p>&quot;FIRST&quot; - Try to find frameworks before
standard libraries or headers. This is the default on
Darwin. &quot;LAST&quot; - Try to find frameworks after
standard libraries or headers. &quot;ONLY&quot; - Only try
to find frameworks. &quot;NEVER&quot;. - Never try to find
frameworks.</p>

<p>On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Application
Bundles, the cmake variable CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE can be set
to empty or one of the following:</p>

<p>&quot;FIRST&quot; - Try to find application bundles
before standard programs. This is the default on Darwin.
&quot;LAST&quot; - Try to find application bundles after
standard programs. &quot;ONLY&quot; - Only try to find
application bundles. &quot;NEVER&quot;. - Never try to find
application bundles.</p>

<p>The CMake variable CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH specifies one or
more directories to be prepended to all other search
directories. This effectively &quot;re-roots&quot; the
entire search under given loca- tions. By default it is
empty. It is especially useful when cross-compiling to point
to the root directory of the target environment and CMake
will search there too. By default at first the directories
listed in CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH and then the non-rooted
directories will be searched. The default behavior can be

CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH will not be used. If
ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then only the re-rooted
direc- tories will be searched.</p>

<p>The default search order is designed to be most-specific
to least-specific for common use cases. Projects may
override the order by simply calling the command multiple
times and using the NO_* options:</p>

<p>find_program(&lt;VAR&gt; NAMES name PATHS paths...
NO_DEFAULT_PATH) find_program(&lt;VAR&gt; NAMES name)</p>

<p>Once one of the calls succeeds the result variable will
be set and stored in the cache so that no call will search
again.</p>

<p>foreach Evaluate a group of commands for each value in a
list.</p>

<p>foreach(loop_var arg1 arg2 ...) COMMAND1(ARGS ...)
COMMAND2(ARGS ...) ... endforeach(loop_var) foreach(loop_var
RANGE total) foreach(loop_var RANGE start stop [step])</p>

<p>All commands between foreach and the matching endforeach
are recorded without being invoked. Once the endforeach is
evalu- ated, the recorded list of commands is invoked once
for each argument listed in the original foreach command.
Before each iteration of the loop &quot;${loop_var}&quot;
will be set as a variable with the current value in the
list.</p>

<p>Foreach can also iterate over a generated range of
numbers. There are three types of this iteration:</p>

<p>* When specifying single number, the range will have
elements 0 to &quot;total&quot;.</p>

<p>* When specifying two numbers, the range will have
elements from the first number to the second number.</p>

<p>* The third optional number is the increment used to
iterate from the first number to the second number.</p>

<p>function Start recording a function for later invocation
as a command.</p>

<p>function(&lt;name&gt; [arg1 [arg2 [arg3 ...]]])
COMMAND1(ARGS ...) COMMAND2(ARGS ...) ...
endfunction(&lt;name&gt;)</p>

<p>Define a function named &lt;name&gt; that takes
arguments named arg1 arg2 arg3 (...). Commands listed after
function, but before the matching endfunction, are not
invoked until the function is invoked. When it is invoked,
the commands recorded in the func- tion are first modified
by replacing formal parameters (${arg1}) with the arguments
passed, and then invoked as normal commands. In addition to
referencing the formal parameters you can refer- ence the
variable ARGC which will be set to the number of argu- ments
passed into the function as well as ARGV0 ARGV1 ARGV2 ...
which will have the actual values of the arguments passed
in. This facilitates creating functions with optional
arguments. Additionally ARGV holds the list of all arguments
given to the function and ARGN holds the list of argument
pass the last expected argument.</p>

<p>See the cmake_policy() command documentation for the
behavior of policies inside functions.</p>

<p>get_cmake_property Get a property of the CMake
instance.</p>

<p>get_cmake_property(VAR property)</p>

<p>Get a property from the CMake instance. The value of the
prop- erty is stored in the variable VAR. If the property is
not found, CMake will report an error. Some supported
properties include: VARIABLES, CACHE_VARIABLES, COMMANDS,
MACROS, and COM- PONENTS.</p>

<p>get_directory_property Get a property of the
directory.</p>

<p>get_directory_property(VAR [DIRECTORY dir] property)</p>

<p>Get a property from the Directory. The value of the
property is stored in the variable VAR. If the property is
not found, CMake will report an error. The properties
include: VARIABLES, CACHE_VARIABLES, COMMANDS, MACROS,
INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES, LINK_DIRECTORIES, DEFINITIONS,
INCLUDE_REGULAR_EXPRESSION, LIST- FILE_STACK,
PARENT_DIRECTORY, and DEFINITION varname. If the DIRECTORY
argument is provided then the property of the provided
directory will be retrieved instead of the current
directory. You can only get properties of a directory during
or after it has been traversed by cmake.</p>

<p>get_filename_component Get a specific component of a
full filename.</p>

<p>get_filename_component(VarName FileName
PATH|ABSOLUTE|NAME|EXT|NAME_WE|REALPATH [CACHE])</p>

<p>Set VarName to be the path (PATH), file name (NAME),
file exten- sion (EXT), file name without extension
(NAME_WE) of FileName, the full path (ABSOLUTE), or the full
path with all symlinks resolved (REALPATH). Note that the
path is converted to Unix slashes format and has no trailing
slashes. The longest file extension is always considered. If
the optional CACHE argument is specified, the result
variable is added to the cache.</p>

<p>get_filename_component(VarName FileName PROGRAM
[PROGRAM_ARGS ArgVar] [CACHE])</p>

<p>The program in FileName will be found in the system
search path or left as a full path. If PROGRAM_ARGS is
present with PRO- GRAM, then any command-line arguments
present in the FileName string are split from the program
name and stored in ArgVar. This is used to separate a
program name from its arguments in a command line
string.</p>

<p>get_property Get a property.</p>

<p>get_property(&lt;variable&gt; &lt;GLOBAL | DIRECTORY
[dir] | TARGET &lt;target&gt; | SOURCE &lt;source&gt; | TEST
&lt;test&gt; | VARIABLE&gt; PROPERTY &lt;name&gt; [SET |
DEFINED | BRIEF_DOCS | FULL_DOCS])</p>

<p>Get one property from one object in a scope. The first
argument specifies the variable in which to store the
result. The second argument determines the scope from which
to get the property. It must be one of the following:</p>

<p>GLOBAL scope is unique and does not accept a name.</p>

<p>DIRECTORY scope defaults to the current directory but
another directory (already processed by CMake) may be named
by full or relative path.</p>

<p>TARGET scope must name one existing target.</p>

<p>SOURCE scope must name one source file.</p>

<p>TEST scope must name one existing test.</p>

<p>VARIABLE scope is unique and does not accept a name.</p>

<p>The required PROPERTY option is immediately followed by
the name of the property to get. If the property is not set
an empty value is returned. If the SET option is given the
variable is set to a boolean value indicating whether the
property has been set. If the DEFINED option is given the
variable is set to a boolean value indicating whether the
property has been defined such as with define_property. If
BRIEF_DOCS or FULL_DOCS is given then the variable is set to
a string containing documenta- tion for the requested
property. If documentation is requested for a property that
has not been defined NOTFOUND is returned.</p>

<p>if Conditionally execute a group of commands.</p>

<p>if(expression) # then section. COMMAND1(ARGS ...)
COMMAND2(ARGS ...) ... elseif(expression2) # elseif section.
COMMAND1(ARGS ...) COMMAND2(ARGS ...) ... else(expression) #
else section. COMMAND1(ARGS ...) COMMAND2(ARGS ...) ...
endif(expression)</p>

<p>Evaluates the given expression. If the result is true,
the com- mands in the THEN section are invoked. Otherwise,
the commands in the else section are invoked. The elseif and
else sections are optional. You may have multiple elseif
clauses. Note that the same expression must be given to if,
and endif. Long expressions can be used and the order or
precedence is that the EXISTS, COMMAND, and DEFINED
operators will be evaluated first. Then any EQUAL, LESS,
GREATER, STRLESS, STRGREATER, STREQUAL, MATCHES will be
evaluated. Then NOT operators and finally AND, OR operators
will be evaluated. Possible expressions are:</p>

<p>if(variable)</p>

<p>True if the variables value is not empty, 0, N, NO, OFF,
FALSE, NOTFOUND, or &lt;variable&gt;-NOTFOUND.</p>

<p>if(NOT variable)</p>

<p>True if the variables value is empty, 0, N, NO, OFF,
FALSE, NOTFOUND, or &lt;variable&gt;-NOTFOUND.</p>

<p>if(variable1 AND variable2)</p>

<p>True if both variables would be considered true
individually.</p>

<p>if(variable1 OR variable2)</p>

<p>True if either variable would be considered true
individually.</p>

<p>if(COMMAND command-name)</p>

<p>True if the given name is a command, macro or function
that can be invoked.</p>

<p>if(POLICY policy-id)</p>

<p>True if the given name is an existing policy (of the
form CMP&lt;NNNN&gt;).</p>

<p>if(TARGET target-name)</p>

<p>True if the given name is an existing target, built or
imported.</p>

<p>if(EXISTS file-name) if(EXISTS directory-name)</p>

<p>True if the named file or directory exists. Behavior is
well-defined only for full paths.</p>

<p>if(file1 IS_NEWER_THAN file2)</p>

<p>True if file1 is newer than file2 or if one of the two
files doesn t exist. Behavior is well-defined only for full
paths.</p>

<p>if(IS_DIRECTORY directory-name)</p>

<p>True if the given name is a directory. Behavior is
well-defined only for full paths.</p>

<p>if(IS_ABSOLUTE path)</p>

<p>True if the given path is an absolute path.</p>

<p>if(variable MATCHES regex) if(string MATCHES regex)</p>

<p>True if the given string or variables value matches the
given regular expression.</p>

<p>if(variable LESS number) if(string LESS number)
if(variable GREATER number) if(string GREATER number)
if(variable EQUAL number) if(string EQUAL number)</p>

<p>True if the given string or variables value is a valid
number and the inequality or equality is true.</p>

<p>if(variable STRLESS string) if(string STRLESS string)
if(variable STRGREATER string) if(string STRGREATER string)
if(variable STREQUAL string) if(string STREQUAL string)</p>

<p>True if the given string or variables value is
lexicographi- cally less (or greater, or equal) than the
string on the right.</p>

<p>if(version1 VERSION_LESS version2) if(version1
VERSION_EQUAL version2) if(version1 VERSION_GREATER
version2)</p>

<p>Component-wise integer version number comparison
(version format is major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]]).</p>

<p>if(DEFINED variable)</p>

<p>True if the given variable is defined. It does not
matter if the variable is true or false just if it has been
set.</p>

<p>include Read CMake listfile code from the given
file.</p>

<p>include(&lt;file|module&gt; [OPTIONAL] [RESULT_VARIABLE
&lt;VAR&gt;] [NO_POLICY_SCOPE])</p>

<p>Reads CMake listfile code from the given file. Commands
in the file are processed immediately as if they were
written in place of the include command. If OPTIONAL is
present, then no error is raised if the file does not exist.
If RESULT_VARIABLE is given the variable will be set to the
full filename which has been included or NOTFOUND if it
failed.</p>

<p>If a module is specified instead of a file, the file
with name &lt;modulename&gt;.cmake is searched in the
CMAKE_MODULE_PATH.</p>

<p>See the cmake_policy() command documentation for
discussion of the NO_POLICY_SCOPE option.</p>

<p>list List operations.</p>

<p>list(LENGTH &lt;list&gt; &lt;output variable&gt;)
list(GET &lt;list&gt; &lt;element index&gt; [&lt;element
index&gt; ...] &lt;output variable&gt;) list(APPEND
&lt;list&gt; &lt;element&gt; [&lt;element&gt; ...])
list(FIND &lt;list&gt; &lt;value&gt; &lt;output
variable&gt;) list(INSERT &lt;list&gt; &lt;element_index&gt;
&lt;element&gt; [&lt;element&gt; ...]) list(REMOVE_ITEM
&lt;list&gt; &lt;value&gt; [&lt;value&gt; ...])
list(REMOVE_AT &lt;list&gt; &lt;index&gt; [&lt;index&gt;
...]) list(REMOVE_DUPLICATES &lt;list&gt;) list(REVERSE
&lt;list&gt;) list(SORT &lt;list&gt;)</p>

<p>LENGTH will return a given lists length.</p>

<p>GET will return list of elements specified by indices
from the list.</p>

<p>APPEND will append elements to the list.</p>

<p>FIND will return the index of the element specified in
the list or -1 if it wasnt found.</p>

<p>INSERT will insert elements to the list to the specified
loca- tion.</p>

<p>REMOVE_AT and REMOVE_ITEM will remove items from the
list. The difference is that REMOVE_ITEM will remove the
given items, while REMOVE_AT will remove the items at the
given indices.</p>

<p>REMOVE_DUPLICATES will remove duplicated items in the
list.</p>

<p>REVERSE reverses the contents of the list in-place.</p>

<p>SORT sorts the list in-place alphabetically.</p>

<p>NOTES: A list in cmake is a ; separated group of
strings. To create a list the set command can be used. For
example, set(var a b c d e) creates a list with a;b;c;d;e,
and set(var &quot;a b c d e&quot;) creates a string or a
list with one item in it.</p>

<p>When specifying index values, if &lt;element index&gt;
is 0 or greater, it is indexed from the beginning of the
list, with 0 representing the first list element. If
&lt;element index&gt; is -1 or lesser, it is indexed from
the end of the list, with -1 repre- senting the last list
element. Be careful when counting with negative indices:
they do not start from 0. -0 is equivalent to 0, the first
list element.</p>

<p>macro Start recording a macro for later invocation as a
command.</p>

<p>macro(&lt;name&gt; [arg1 [arg2 [arg3 ...]]])
COMMAND1(ARGS ...) COMMAND2(ARGS ...) ...
endmacro(&lt;name&gt;)</p>

<p>Define a macro named &lt;name&gt; that takes arguments
named arg1 arg2 arg3 (...). Commands listed after macro, but
before the match- ing endmacro, are not invoked until the
macro is invoked. When it is invoked, the commands recorded
in the macro are first mod- ified by replacing formal
parameters (${arg1}) with the argu- ments passed, and then
invoked as normal commands. In addition to referencing the
formal parameters you can reference the val- ues ${ARGC}
which will be set to the number of arguments passed into the
function as well as ${ARGV0} ${ARGV1} ${ARGV2} ... which
will have the actual values of the arguments passed in. This
facilitates creating macros with optional arguments. Addi-
tionally ${ARGV} holds the list of all arguments given to
the macro and ${ARGN} holds the list of argument pass the
last expected argument. Note that the parameters to a macro
and val- ues such as ARGN are not variables in the usual
CMake sense. They are string replacements much like the c
preprocessor would do with a macro. If you want true CMake
variables you should look at the function command.</p>

<p>See the cmake_policy() command documentation for the
behavior of policies inside macros.</p>

<p>make_directory Deprecated. Use the file(MAKE_DIRECTORY )
command instead.</p>

<p>make_directory(directory)</p>

<p>Creates the specified directory. Full paths should be
given. Any parent directories that do not exist will also be
created. Use with care.</p>

<p>mark_as_advanced Mark cmake cached variables as
advanced.</p>

<p>mark_as_advanced([CLEAR|FORCE] VAR VAR2 VAR...)</p>

<p>Mark the named cached variables as advanced. An advanced
vari- able will not be displayed in any of the cmake GUIs
unless the show advanced option is on. If CLEAR is the first
argument advanced variables are changed back to unadvanced.
If FORCE is the first argument, then the variable is made
advanced. If nei- ther FORCE nor CLEAR is specified, new
values will be marked as advanced, but if the variable
already has an advanced/non-advanced state, it will not be
changed.</p>

<p>It does nothing in script mode.</p>

<p>math Mathematical expressions.</p>

<p>math(EXPR &lt;output variable&gt; &lt;math
expression&gt;)</p>

<p>EXPR evaluates mathematical expression and return result
in the output variable. Example mathematical expression is 5
* ( 10 + 13 ). Supported operators are + - * / % | &amp; ^ ~
&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt; * / %. They have the same meaning as they
do in c code.</p>

<p>message Display a message to the user.</p>

<p>message([SEND_ERROR | STATUS | FATAL_ERROR]
&quot;message to display&quot; ...)</p>

<p>By default the message is displayed in a pop up window
(CMake- Setup), or in the stdout of cmake, or the error
section of ccmake. If the first argument is SEND_ERROR then
an error is raised, and the generate phase will be skipped.
If the first argument is FATAL_ERROR, all processing is
halted. If the first argument is STATUS then the message is
displayed in the progress line for the GUI, or with a -- in
the command line cmake.</p>

<p>option Provides an option that the user can optionally
select.</p>

<p>option(&lt;option_variable&gt; &quot;help string
describing option&quot; [initial value])</p>

<p>Provide an option for the user to select as ON or OFF.
If no initial value is provided, OFF is used.</p>

<p>remove Deprecated. Use the list(REMOVE_ITEM ) command
instead.</p>

<p>remove(VAR VALUE VALUE ...)</p>

<p>Removes VALUE from the variable VAR. This is typically
used to remove entries from a vector (e.g. semicolon
separated list). VALUE is expanded.</p>

<p>return Return from a file, directory or function.</p>

<p>return()</p>

<p>Returns from a file, directory or function. When this
command is encountered in an included file (via include() or
find_pack- age()), it causes processing of the current file
to stop and control is returned to the including file. If it
is encountered in a file which is not included by another
file, e.g. a CMake- Lists.txt, control is returned to the
parent directory if there is one. If return is called in a
function, control is returned to the caller of the function.
Note that a macro is not a func- tion and does not handle
return like a function does.</p>

<p>separate_arguments Split space separated arguments into
a semi-colon separated list.</p>

<p>separate_arguments(VARIABLE)</p>

<p>Convert the value of VARIABLE to a semi-colon separated
list. All spaces are replaced with ;. This helps with
generating command lines.</p>

<p>set Set a CMAKE variable to a given value.</p>

<p>set(&lt;variable&gt; &lt;value&gt; [[CACHE &lt;type&gt;
&lt;docstring&gt; [FORCE]] | PARENT_SCOPE])</p>

<p>Within CMake sets &lt;variable&gt; to the value
&lt;value&gt;. &lt;value&gt; is expanded before
&lt;variable&gt; is set to it. If CACHE is present, then the
&lt;variable&gt; is put in the cache. &lt;type&gt; and
&lt;docstring&gt; are then required. &lt;type&gt; is used by
the CMake GUI to choose a widget with which the user sets a
value. The value for &lt;type&gt; may be one of</p>

<p>FILEPATH = File chooser dialog. PATH = Directory chooser
dialog. STRING = Arbitrary string. BOOL = Boolean ON/OFF
checkbox. INTERNAL = No GUI entry (used for persistent
variables).</p>

<p>If &lt;type&gt; is INTERNAL, then the &lt;value&gt; is
always written into the cache, replacing any values existing
in the cache. If it is not a cache variable, then this
always writes into the current makefile. The FORCE option
will overwrite the cache value remov- ing any changes by the
user.</p>

<p>If PARENT_SCOPE is present, the variable will be set in
the scope above the current scope. Each new directory or
function creates a new scope. This command will set the
value of a vari- able into the parent directory or calling
function (whichever is applicable to the case at hand) If
VALUE is not specified then the variable is removed from the
parent scope.</p>

<p>set(&lt;variable&gt; &lt;value1&gt; ...
&lt;valueN&gt;)</p>

<p>In this case &lt;variable&gt; is set to a semicolon
separated list of values.</p>

<p>&lt;variable&gt; can be an environment variable such
as:</p>

<p>set( ENV{PATH} /home/martink )</p>

<p>in which case the environment variable will be set.</p>

<p>set_directory_properties Set a property of the
directory.</p>

<p>set_directory_properties(PROPERTIES prop1 value1 prop2
value2)</p>

<p>Set a property for the current directory and
subdirectories. If the property is not found, CMake will
report an error. The prop- erties include:
INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES, LINK_DIRECTORIES,
INCLUDE_REGULAR_EXPRESSION, and
ADDITIONAL_MAKE_CLEAN_FILES.</p>

<p>ADDITIONAL_MAKE_CLEAN_FILES is a list of files that will
be cleaned as a part of &quot;make clean&quot; stage.</p>

<p>set_property Set a named property in a given scope.</p>

<p>set_property(&lt;GLOBAL | DIRECTORY [dir] | TARGET
[target1 [target2 ...]] | SOURCE [src1 [src2 ...]] | TEST
[test1 [test2 ...]]&gt; [APPEND] PROPERTY &lt;name&gt;
[value1 [value2 ...]])</p>

<p>Set one property on zero or more objects of a scope. The
first argument determines the scope in which the property is
set. It must be one of the following:</p>

<p>GLOBAL scope is unique and does not accept a name.</p>

<p>DIRECTORY scope defaults to the current directory but
another directory (already processed by CMake) may be named
by full or relative path.</p>

<p>TARGET scope may name zero or more existing targets.</p>

<p>SOURCE scope may name zero or more source files.</p>

<p>TEST scope may name zero or more existing tests.</p>

<p>The required PROPERTY option is immediately followed by
the name of the property to set. Remaining arguments are
used to compose the property value in the form of a
semicolon-separated list. If the APPEND option is given the
list is appended to any exist- ing property value.</p>

<p>site_name Set the given variable to the name of the
computer.</p>

<p>site_name(variable)</p>

<p>string String operations.</p>

<p>string(REGEX MATCH &lt;regular_expression&gt; &lt;output
variable&gt; &lt;input&gt; [&lt;input&gt;...]) string(REGEX
MATCHALL &lt;regular_expression&gt; &lt;output variable&gt;
&lt;input&gt; [&lt;input&gt;...]) string(REGEX REPLACE
&lt;regular_expression&gt; &lt;replace_expression&gt;
&lt;output variable&gt; &lt;input&gt; [&lt;input&gt;...])
string(REPLACE &lt;match_string&gt; &lt;replace_string&gt;
&lt;output variable&gt; &lt;input&gt; [&lt;input&gt;...])
string(COMPARE EQUAL &lt;string1&gt; &lt;string2&gt;
&lt;output variable&gt;) string(COMPARE NOTEQUAL
&lt;string1&gt; &lt;string2&gt; &lt;output variable&gt;)
string(COMPARE LESS &lt;string1&gt; &lt;string2&gt;
&lt;output variable&gt;) string(COMPARE GREATER
&lt;string1&gt; &lt;string2&gt; &lt;output variable&gt;)
string(ASCII &lt;number&gt; [&lt;number&gt; ...] &lt;output
variable&gt;) string(CONFIGURE &lt;string1&gt; &lt;output
variable&gt; [@ONLY] [ESCAPE_QUOTES]) string(TOUPPER
&lt;string1&gt; &lt;output variable&gt;) string(TOLOWER
&lt;string1&gt; &lt;output variable&gt;) string(LENGTH
&lt;string&gt; &lt;output variable&gt;) string(SUBSTRING
&lt;string&gt; &lt;begin&gt; &lt;length&gt; &lt;output
variable&gt;) string(STRIP &lt;string&gt; &lt;output
variable&gt;) string(RANDOM [LENGTH &lt;length&gt;]
[ALPHABET &lt;alphabet&gt;] &lt;output variable&gt;)</p>

<p>REGEX MATCH will match the regular expression once and
store the match in the output variable.</p>

<p>REGEX MATCHALL will match the regular expression as many
times as possible and store the matches in the output
variable as a list.</p>

<p>REGEX REPLACE will match the regular expression as many
times as possible and substitute the replacement expression
for the match in the output. The replace expression may
refer to paren-delim- ited subexpressions of the match using
1, 2, ..., 9. Note that two backslashes (\1) are required in
CMake code to get a backslash through argument parsing.</p>

<p>REPLACE will replace all occurrences of match_string in
the input with replace_string and store the result in the
output.</p>

<p>COMPARE EQUAL/NOTEQUAL/LESS/GREATER will compare the
strings and store true or false in the output variable.</p>

<p>ASCII will convert all numbers into corresponding ASCII
charac- ters.</p>

<p>CONFIGURE will transform a string like CONFIGURE_FILE
transforms a file.</p>

<p>TOUPPER/TOLOWER will convert string to upper/lower
characters.</p>

<p>LENGTH will return a given strings length.</p>

<p>SUBSTRING will return a substring of a given string.</p>

<p>STRIP will return a substring of a given string with
leading and trailing spaces removed.</p>

<p>RANDOM will return a random string of given length
consisting of characters from the given alphabet. Default
length is 5 charac- ters and default alphabet is all numbers
and upper and lower case letters.</p>

<p>The following characters have special meaning in regular
expres- sions:</p>

<p>^ Matches at beginning of a line $ Matches at end of a
line . Matches any single character [ ] Matches any
character(s) inside the brackets [^ ] Matches any
character(s) not inside the brackets - Matches any character
in range on either side of a dash * Matches preceding
pattern zero or more times + Matches preceding pattern one
or more times ? Matches preceding pattern zero or once only
| Matches a pattern on either side of the | () Saves a
matched subexpression, which can be referenced in the REGEX
REPLACE operation. Additionally it is saved by all regular
expression-related commands, including e.g. if( MATCHES ),
in the variables CMAKE_MATCH_(0..9).</p>

<p>unset Unset a variable, cache variable, or environment
variable.</p>

<p>unset(&lt;variable&gt; [CACHE])</p>

<p>Removes the specified variable causing it to become
undefined. If CACHE is present then the variable is removed
from the cache instead of the current scope.</p>

<p>&lt;variable&gt; can be an environment variable such
as:</p>

<p>unset(ENV{LD_LIBRARY_PATH})</p>

<p>in which case the variable will be removed from the
current environment.</p>

<p>variable_watch Watch the CMake variable for change.</p>

<p>variable_watch(&lt;variable name&gt; [&lt;command to
execute&gt;])</p>

<p>If the specified variable changes, the message will be
printed about the variable being changed. If the command is
specified, the command will be executed. The command will
receive the fol- lowing arguments: COMMAND(&lt;variable&gt;
&lt;access&gt; &lt;value&gt; &lt;current list file&gt;
&lt;stack&gt;)</p>

<p>while Evaluate a group of commands while a condition is
true</p>

<p>while(condition) COMMAND1(ARGS ...) COMMAND2(ARGS ...)
... endwhile(condition)</p>

<p>All commands between while and the matching endwhile are
recorded without being invoked. Once the endwhile is
evaluated, the recorded list of commands is invoked as long
as the condi- tion is true. The condition is evaluated using
the same logic as the if command.</p>

<p>write_file Deprecated. Use the file(WRITE ) command
instead.</p>

<p>write_file(filename &quot;message to write&quot;...
[APPEND])</p>

<p>The first argument is the file name, the rest of the
arguments are messages to write. If the argument APPEND is
specified, then the message will be appended.</p>

<p>NOTE 1: file(WRITE ... and file(APPEND ... do exactly
the same as this one but add some more functionality.</p>

<p>NOTE 2: When using write_file the produced file cannot
be used as an input to CMake (CONFIGURE_FILE, source file
...) because it will lead to an infinite loop. Use
configure_file if you want to generate input files to
CMake.</p>

<p>PROPERTIES CMake Properties - Properties supported by
CMake, the Cross-Platform Makefile Generator.</p>

<p>This is the documentation for the properties supported
by CMake. Prop- erties can have different scopes. They can
either be assigned to a source file, a directory, a target
or globally to CMake. By modifying the values of properties
the behaviour of the build system can be cus- tomized.</p>

<p>COMPATIBILITY COMMANDS CMake Compatibility Listfile
Commands - Obsolete commands supported by CMake for
compatibility.</p>

<p>This is the documentation for now obsolete listfile
commands from pre- vious CMake versions, which are still
supported for compatibility rea- sons. You should instead
use the newer, faster and shinier new com- mands. ;-)</p>
