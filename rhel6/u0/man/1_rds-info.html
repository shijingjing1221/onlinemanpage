<p>RDS-INFO(1) BSD General Commands Manual RDS-INFO(1)</p>

<p>NAME rds-info - display information from the RDS kernel
module</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rds-info [-v] [-cknrstIT]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The rds-info utility presents various
sources of information that the RDS kernel module maintains.
When run without any optional arguments rds-info will output
all the information it knows of. When options are specified
then only the information associated with those options is
dis- played.</p>

<p>The options are as follows:</p>

<p>-v Requests verbose output. When this option is given,
some classes of information will display additional
data.</p>

<p>-c Display global counters. Each counter increments as
its event occurs. The counters may not be reset. The set of
supported counters may change over time.</p>

<p>CounterName The name of the counter. These names come
from the kernel and can change depending on the capability
of the kernel module.</p>

<p>Value The number of times that the counter has been
incremented since the kernel module was loaded.</p>

<p>-k Display all the RDS sockets in the system. There will
always be one socket listed that is neither bound to nor
connected to any addresses because rds-info itself uses an
unbound socket to col- lect information.</p>

<p>BoundAddr, BPort The IP address and port that the socket
is bound to. 0.0.0.0 0 indicates that the socket has not
been bound.</p>

<p>ConnAddr, CPort The IP address and port that the socket
is connected to. 0.0.0.0 0 indicates that the socket has not
been connected.</p>

<p>SndBuf, RcvBuf The number of bytes of message payload
which can be queued for sending or receiving on the socket,
respectively.</p>

<p>Inode The number of the inode object associated with the
socket. Can be used to locate the process owning a given
socket by search- ing /proc/*/fd for open files referencing
a socket with this inode number.</p>

<p>-n Display all RDS connections. RDS connections are
maintained between nodes by transports.</p>

<p>LocalAddr The IP address of this node. For connections
that originate and terminate on the same node the local
address indicates which address initiated the connection
establishment.</p>

<p>RemoteAddr The IP address of the remote end of the
connection.</p>

<p>NextTX The sequence number that will be given to the
next message that is sent over the connection.</p>

<p>NextRX The sequence number that is expected from the
next message to arrive over the connection. Any incoming
messages with sequence numbers less than this will be
dropped.</p>

<p>Flg Flags which indicate the state of the
connection.</p>

<p>s A process is currently sending a message down the
connection.</p>

<p>c The transport is attempting to connect to the remote
address.</p>

<p>C The connection to the remote host is connected and
active.</p>

<p>-r, -s, -t Display the messages in the receive, send, or
retransmit queues respectively.</p>

<p>LocalAddr, LPort The local IP address and port on this
node associated with the message. For sent messages this is
the source address, for receive messages it is the
destination address.</p>

<p>RemoteAddr, RPort The remote IP address and port
associated with the message. For sent messages this is the
destination address, for receive mes- sages it is the source
address.</p>

<p>Seq The sequence number of the message.</p>

<p>Bytes The number of bytes in the message payload.</p>

<p>The following information sources are dependent on
specific transports which may not always be available.</p>

<p>-I Display the IB connections which the IB transport is
using to provide RDS connections.</p>

<p>LocalAddr The local IP address of this connection.</p>

<p>RemoteAddr The remote IP address of this connection.</p>

<p>LocalDev The local IB Global Identifier, printed in IPv6
address syntax.</p>

<p>RemoteDev The remote IB Global Identifier, printed in
IPv6 address syn- tax.</p>

<p>If verbose output is requested, per-connection settings
such as the maximum number of send and receive work requests
will be dis- played in addition.</p>

<p>-T Display the TCP sockets which the TCP transport is
using to pro- vide RDS connections.</p>

<p>LocalAddr, LPort The local IP address and port of this
socket.</p>

<p>RemoteAddr, RPort The remote IP address and port that
this socket is connected to.</p>

<p>HdrRemain The number of bytes that must be read off the
socket to com- plete the next full RDS header.</p>

<p>DataRemain The number of bytes that must be read off the
socket to com- plete the data payload of the message which
is being received.</p>

<p>SentNxt The TCP sequence number of the first byte of the
last message that we sent down the connection.</p>

<p>ExpectedUna The TCP sequence number of the byte past the
last byte of the last message that we sent down the
connection. When we see that the remote side has acked up to
this byte then we know that the remote side has received all
our RDS messages.</p>

<p>SeenUna The TCP sequence number of the byte past the
last byte which has been acked by the remote host.</p>
