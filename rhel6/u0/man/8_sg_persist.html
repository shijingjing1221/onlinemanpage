<p>SG_PERSIST(8) SG3_UTILS SG_PERSIST(8)</p>

<p>NAME sg_persist - sends a SCSI PERSISTENT RESERVE (IN or
OUT) command to manipulate registrations and
reservations</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sg_persist [OPTIONS] DEVICE</p>

<p>sg_persist [OPTIONS] --device=DEVICE</p>

<p>sg_persist --help | --version</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This utility allows Persistent reservations
and registrations to be queried and changed. Persistent
reservations and registrations are queried by sub-commands
(called &quot;service actions&quot; in SPC-4) of the SCSI
PERSISTENT RESERVE IN (PRIN) command. Persistent
reservations and reg- istrations are changed by sub-commands
of the SCSI PERSISTENT RESERVE OUT (PROUT) command.</p>

<p>There is a two stage process to obtain a persistent
reservation. First an application (an I_T nexus in standards
jargon) must register a reservation key. If that is accepted
(and it should be unless some other I_T nexus has registered
that key) then the application can try and reserve the
device. The reserve operation must specify the reser- vation
key and a &quot;type&quot; (see the --prout-type=TYPE
option).</p>

<p>It is relatively safe to query the state of Persistent
reservations and registrations. With no options this utility
defaults to the READ KEYS sub-command of the PRIN command.
Other PRIN sub-commands are READ RESERVATION, REPORT
CAPABILITIES and READ FULL STATUS.</p>

<p>Before trying to change Persistent reservations and
registrations users should be aware of what they are doing.
The relevant sections of the SCSI Primary Commands document
(i.e. SPC-4 whose most recent draft is revision 20 dated 22
May 2009) are sections 5.7 (titled &quot;Reserva-
tions&quot;), 6.13 (for the PRIN command) and 6.14 (for the
PROUT command). To safeguard against accidental use, the
--out option must be given when a PROUT sub-command (e.g.
--register) is used.</p>

<p>The older SCSI RESERVE and RELEASE commands (both 6 and
10 byte vari- ants) are not supported by this utility. In
SPC-3, RESERVE and RELEASE are deprecated, replaced by
Persistent Reservations. RESERVE and RELEASE have been
removed from SPC-4 and Annex B is provided showing how to
convert to persistent reservation commands. See a utility
called scsires for support of the SCSI RESERVE and RELEASE
commands.</p>

<p>The DEVICE is required by all variants of this utility
apart from --help. The DEVICE can be given either as an
argument (typically but not necessarily the last one) or via
the --device=DEVICE option.</p>

<p>SPC-4 does not use the term &quot;sub-command&quot;. It
uses the term &quot;service action&quot; for this and for
part of a fields name in the parameter block associated with
the PROUT command (i.e. &quot;service action reservation
key&quot;). To lessen the potential confusion the term
&quot;sub-command&quot; has been introduced.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Arguments to long options are mandatory for
short options as well. The following options are sorted in
alphabetical order, based on their long option name.</p>

<p>-l, --alloc-length=LEN specify the allocation length of
the PRIN command. LEN is a hex value. By default this value
is set to the size of the data-in buffer (8192). This
parameter is of use for verification that response to PRIN
commands with various allocation lengths is per section
4.3.5.6 of SPC-4 revision 18. Valid LEN values are
0-8192.</p>

<p>-C, --clear Clear is a sub-command of the PROUT command.
It releases the persistent reservation (if any) and clears
all registrations from the device. It is required to supply
a reservation key that is registered for this I_T_L nexus
(identified by --param-rk=RK).</p>

<p>-d, --device=DEVICE DEVICE to send SCSI commands to. The
DEVICE can either be pro- vided via this option or via a
freestanding argument. For exam- ple, these two: sg_persist
--device=/dev/sg2 and sg_persist /dev/sg2 are
equivalent.</p>

<p>-h, --help output a usage message.</p>

<p>-H, --hex the response to a valid PRIN sub-command will
be output in hex- adecimal. By default (i.e. without this
option) if the PRIN sub-command is recognised then the
response will be decoded as per SPC-4.</p>

<p>-i, --in specify that a SCSI PERSISTENT RESERVE IN
command is required. This is the default.</p>

<p>-n, --no-inquiry the default action is to do a standard
SCSI INQUIRY command and output make, product and revision
strings plus the peripheral device type prior to executing a
PRIN or PROUT command. With this option the INQUIRY command
is skipped.</p>

<p>-o, --out specify that a SCSI PERSISTENT RESERVE OUT
command is required.</p>

<p>-Y, --param-alltgpt set the all target ports (ALL_TG_PT)
flag in the parameter block of the PROUT command. Only
relevant for register and register and ignore existing key
sub-commands.</p>

<p>-Z, --param-aptpl set the activate persist through power
loss (APTPL) flag in the parameter block of the PROUT
command. Relevant for regis- ter, register and ignore
existing key and register and move sub-commands.</p>

<p>-K, --param-rk=RK specify the reservation key found in
the parameter block of the PROUT command. RK is assumed to
be hex (up to 8 bytes long). Default value is 0. This option
is needed by most PROUT sub-com- mands.</p>

<p>-S, --param-sark=SARK specify the service action
reservation key found in the parame- ter block of the PROUT
command. SARK is assumed to be hex (up to 8 bytes long).
Default value is 0. This option is needed by some PROUT
sub-commands.</p>

<p>-P, --preempt Preempt is a sub-command of the PROUT
command. Preempts the existing persistent reservation
(identified by --param-sark=SARK) with the registration key
that is registered for this I_T_L nexus (identified by
--param-rk=RK). The associated --prout-type=TYPE option
needs to match the type of the reservation.</p>

<p>-A, --preempt-abort Preempt and Abort is a sub-command
of the PROUT command. Pre- empts the existing persistent
reservation (identified by --param-sark=SARK) with the
registration key that is registered for this I_T_L nexus
(identified by --param-rk=RK). The associ- ated
--prout-type=TYPE option needs to match the type of the
reservation. ACA and other pending tasks are aborted.</p>

<p>-T, --prout-type=TYPE specify the PROUT command s type
argument. Required by the register-move , reserve, release
and preempt (and abort) sub-commands. Valid TYPE values:
1-&gt; write exclusive, 3-&gt; exclu- sive access, 5-&gt;
write exclusive - registrants only, 6-&gt; exclu- sive
access - registrants only, 7-&gt; write exclusive - all
regis- trants, 8-&gt; exclusive access - all registrants.
Default value is 0 (which is an invalid type). Each
&quot;persistent reservation type&quot; is explained in more
detail in a subsection of that name in the read reservation
section of the PRIN command (section 6.13.3.4 of SPC-4
revision 9).</p>

<p>-s, --read-full-status Read Full Status is a sub-command
of the PRIN command. For each registration with the given
SCSI device, it lists the reserva- tion key and associated
information. TransportIDs, if supplied in the response, are
decoded.</p>

<p>-k, --read-keys Read Keys is a sub-command of the PRIN
command. Lists all the reservation keys registered (i.e.
registrations) with the given SCSI device. This is the
default sub-command for the SCSI PRIN command.</p>

<p>-r, --read-reservation Read Reservation is a sub-command
of the PRIN command. List information about the current
holder of the reservation on the DEVICE. If there is no
current reservation this will be noted. Information about
the current holder of the reservation includes its
reservation key, scope and type.</p>

<p>-s, --read-status same as --read-full-status.</p>

<p>-G, --register Register is a sub-command of the PROUT
command. It has 3 differ- ent actions depending on
associated parameters. a) add a new registration with
--param-rk=0 and --param-sark=&lt;new_rk&gt;; b) Change an
existing registration with --param-rk=&lt;old_rk&gt; and
--param-sark=&lt;new_rk&gt; ; or c) Delete an existing
registration with --param-rk=&lt;old_rk&gt; and
--param-sark=0.</p>

<p>-I, --register-ignore Register and Ignore Existing Key
is a sub-command of the PROUT command. Similar to --register
except that when changing a reservation key the old key is
not specified. The --param-sark=&lt;new_rk&gt; option should
also be given.</p>

<p>-M, --register-move register (another initiator) and
move (the reservation held by the current initiator to that
other initiator) is a sub-command of the PROUT command. It
requires the transportID of the other initiator. [The
standard uses the term I_T nexus but the point to stress is
that there are two initiators (the one sending this command
and another one) but only one logical unit.] The
--prout-type=TYPE and --param-rk=RK options need to match
that of the existing reservation while --param-sark=SARK
option specifies the reservation key of the new (i.e.
destination) reg- istration.</p>

<p>-Q, --relative-target-port=RTPI relative target port
identifier that reservation is to be moved to by PROUT
register and move sub-command. RTPI is assumed to be hex in
the range 0 to ffff inclusive. Defaults to 0 .</p>

<p>-L, --release Release is a sub-command of the PROUT
command. It releases the current persistent reservation. The
--prout-type=TYPE and --param-rk=RK options, matching the
reservation, must also be specified.</p>

<p>-c, --report-capabilities Report Capabilities is a
sub-command of the PRIN command. It lists information about
the aspects of persistent reservations that the DEVICE
supports.</p>

<p>-R, --reserve Reserve is a sub-command of the PROUT
command. It creates a new persistent reservation (if
permitted). The --prout-type=TYPE and --param-rk=RK options
must also be specified.</p>

<p>-X, --transport-id=TIDS The TIDS argument can take one
of several forms. It can be a comma (or single space)
separated list of ASCII hex bytes repre- senting a single
TransportID as defined in SPC-4. They are usu- ally 24 bytes
long apart from in iSCSI. The TIDS argument may be a
transport specific form (e.g.
&quot;sas,5000c50005b32001&quot;). The TIDS argument may be
&quot;-&quot; in which case one or more TransportIDs can be
read from stdin. The TIDS argument may be of the form
&quot;file=&lt;name&gt;&quot; in which case one or more
TransportIDs can be read from a file called &lt;name&gt;.
See the &quot;TRANSPORT IDs&quot; section below for more
information.</p>

<p>-U, --unreg optional when the PROUT register and move
sub-command is invoked. If given it will unregister the
current initiator (I_T nexus) after the other initiator has
been registered and the reservation moved to it. When not
given the initiator (I_T nexus) that sent the PROUT command
remains registered.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose print out cdb of issued commands prior to
execution. If used twice prints out the parameter block
associated with the PROUT command prior to its execution as
well. If used thrice decodes given transportID(s) as well.
To see the response to a PRIN com- mand in low level form
use the --hex option.</p>

<p>-V, --version print out version string. Ignore all other
parameters.</p>

<p>-? output usage message. Ignore all other
parameters.</p>

<p>TRANSPORT IDs TransportIDs are used in persistent
reservations to identify initia- tors. The format of a
TransportID differs depending on the type of transport being
used. Their format is described in SPC-4 (in draft revision
20 see section 7.5.4).</p>

<p>A TransportID is required for the PROUT register and
move sub-command and the PROUT register sub-command can have
zero, one or more Trans- portIDs.</p>

<p>When the --transport-id=TIDS option is given then the
TIDS argument may be a comma (or single space) separated
list of ASCII hex bytes that represent a single TransportID
as defined in SPC-4. Alternatively the TIDS argument may be
a transport specific string starting with either
&quot;fcp,&quot;, &quot;spi,&quot;, &quot;sbp,&quot;,
&quot;srp,&quot;, &quot;iqn&quot;, or &quot;sas,&quot;. The
&quot;iqn&quot; form is an iSCSI qualified name. Apart from
&quot;iqn&quot; the other transport specific leadin string
may be given in upper case (e.g. &quot;FCP,&quot;).</p>

<p>The &quot;fcp,&quot; form should be followed by 16 ASCII
hex digits that repre- sent an initiators N_PORT_NAME. The
&quot;spi,&quot; form should be followed by
&quot;&lt;scsi_address&gt;,&lt;relative_target_port_identifier&gt;&quot;
(both decimal num- bers). The &quot;sbp,&quot; form should
be followed by 16 ASCII hex digits that represent an
initiator s EUI-64 name. The &quot;srp,&quot; form should be
fol- lowed by 32 ASCII hex digits that represent an
initiator port identi- fier. The &quot;sas,&quot; form
should be followed by 16 ASCII hex digits that represent an
initiators port SAS address.</p>

<p>There are two iSCSI qualified name forms. The shorter
form contains the iSCSI name of the initiator port (e.g.
&quot;iqn.5886.com.acme.diskarrays- sn-a8675309&quot;). The
longer form adds the initiator session id (ISID in hex)
separated by &quot;,i,0x&quot;. For example
&quot;iqn.5886.com.acme.diskarrays-
sn-a8675309,i,0x1234567890ab&quot;. On the command line to
stop punctuation in an iSCSI name being (mis)- interpreted
by the shell, putting the option argument containing the
iSCSI name in double quotes is advised. iSCSI names are
encoded in UTF-8 so if non (7 bit) ASCII characters appear
in the iSCSI name on the command line, there will be
difficul- ties if they are not encoded in UTF-8. The locale
can be changed tem- porarily by prefixing the command line
invocation of sg_persist with &quot;LANG=en_US.utf-8&quot;
for example.</p>

<p>Alternatively the TIDS argument may specify a file (or
pipe) from which one or more TransportIDs may be read. If
the TIDS argument is &quot;-&quot; then stdin (standard
input) is read. If the TIDS argument is of the form
&quot;file=&lt;name&gt;&quot; than a file called
&lt;name&gt; is read. A valid SPC-4 Trans- portID is built
from the transport specific string outlined in the pre-
vious paragraphs. The parsing of the data read is realtively
simple. Empty lines are ignored. Everything from and
including a &quot;#&quot; on a line is ignored. Leading
spaces and tabs are ignored. There can be one transportID
per line. The transportID can either be a comma, space or
tab separated list of ASCII hex bytes that represent a
TransportID as defined in SPC-4. Padding with zero bytes to
a minimum length of 24 bytes is performed if necessary. The
transportID may also be transport specific string type
discussed above.</p>

<p>In SPC-3 the SPEC_I_PT bit set to one and TransportIDs
were allowed for the PROUT register and ignore existing key
sub-command. In SPC-4 that is disallowed yielding a CHECK
CONDITION status with and ILLEGAL REQUEST sense key and an
additional sense code set to INVALID FIELD IN PARAMETER
LIST.</p>

<p>NOTES In the 2.4 series of Linux kernels the DEVICE must
be a SCSI generic (sg) device. In the 2.6 series any SCSI
device name (e.g. /dev/sdc, /dev/st1m or /dev/sg3) can be
specified. For example &quot;sg_persist --read-keys
/dev/sdb&quot; will work in the 2.6 series kernels.</p>

<p>The only scope for PROUT commands supported in the
current draft of SPC-4 is &quot;LU_SCOPE&quot;. Hence there
seems to be no point in offering an option to set scope to
another value.</p>

<p>Most errors with the PROUT sub-commands (e.g. missing or
mismatched --prout-type=TYPE) will result in a RESERVATION
CONFLICT status. This can be a bit confusing when you know
there is only one (active) initia- tor: the
&quot;conflict&quot; is with the SPC standard, not another
initiator.</p>

<p>Some recent disks accept some PRIN and PROUT
sub-commands when the media is stopped. One exception was
setting the APTPL flag (with the --param-aptpl option)
during a key register operation, it complained if the disk
one stopped. The error indicated it wanted the disk spun up
and when that happened, the registration was successful.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Due to defaults the simplest example executes
the read keys sub-com- mand of the PRIN command:</p>

<p>sg_persist /dev/sdb</p>

<p>This is the same as the following (long-winded)
command:</p>

<p>sg_persist --in --read-keys --device=/dev/sdb</p>

<p>To read the current reservation either the
--read-reservation form or the shorter -r can be used:</p>

<p>sg_persist -r /dev/sdb</p>

<p>To register the new reservation key 0x123abc the
following could be used:</p>

<p>sg_persist --out --register --param-sark=123abc
/dev/sdb</p>

<p>Given the above registration succeeds, to reserve the
DEVICE (with type write exclusive) the following could be
used:</p>

<p>sg_persist --out --reserve --param-rk=123abc
--prout-type=1 /dev/sdb</p>

<p>To release the reservation the following can be given
(note that the --param-rk and --prout-type arguments must
match those of the reserva- tion):</p>

<p>sg_persist --out --release --param-rk=123abc
--prout-type=1 /dev/sdb</p>

<p>Finally to unregister a reservation key (and not effect
other registra- tions which is what --clear would do) the
command is a little sur- prising:</p>

<p>sg_persist --out --register --param-rk=123abc
/dev/sdb</p>

<p>Now have a close look at the difference between the
register and unreg- ister examples above.</p>

<p>An example file that is suitably formatted to pass
transportIDs via a --transport-id=file=transport_ids.txt
option can be found in the examples sub-directory of the
sg3_utils package. There is also a simple test script called
sg_persist_tst.sh in the same directory.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The exit status of sg_persist is 0 when it
is successful. Otherwise see the sg3_utils(8) man page.</p>
