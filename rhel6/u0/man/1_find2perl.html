<p>FIND2PERL(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
FIND2PERL(1)</p>

<p>NAME find2perl - translate find command lines to Perl
code</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS find2perl [paths] [predicates] | perl</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION find2perl is a little translator to convert
find command lines to equivalent Perl code. The resulting
code is typically faster than running find itself.</p>

<p>&quot;paths&quot; are a set of paths where find2perl
will start its searches and &quot;predicates&quot; are taken
from the following list.</p>

<p>&quot;! PREDICATE&quot; Negate the sense of the
following predicate. The &quot;!&quot; must be passed as a
distinct argument, so it may need to be surrounded by
whitespace and/or quoted from interpretation by the shell
using a backslash (just as with using find(1)).</p>

<p>&quot;( PREDICATES )&quot; Group the given PREDICATES.
The parentheses must be passed as distinct arguments, so
they may need to be surrounded by whitespace and/or quoted
from interpretation by the shell using a backslash (just as
with using find(1)).</p>

<p>&quot;PREDICATE1 PREDICATE2&quot; True if _both_
PREDICATE1 and PREDICATE2 are true; PREDICATE2 is not
evaluated if PREDICATE1 is false.</p>

<p>&quot;PREDICATE1 -o PREDICATE2&quot; True if either one
of PREDICATE1 or PREDICATE2 is true; PREDICATE2 is not
evaluated if PREDICATE1 is true.</p>

<p>&quot;-follow&quot; Follow (dereference) symlinks. The
checking of file attributes depends on the position of the
&quot;-follow&quot; option. If it precedes the file check
option, an &quot;stat&quot; is done which means the file
check applies to the file the symbolic link is pointing to.
If &quot;-follow&quot; option follows the file check option,
this now applies to the symbolic link itself, i.e. an
&quot;lstat&quot; is done.</p>

<p>&quot;-depth&quot; Change directory traversal algorithm
from breadth-first to depth- first.</p>

<p>&quot;-prune&quot; Do not descend into the directory
currently matched.</p>

<p>&quot;-xdev&quot; Do not traverse mount points (prunes
search at mount-point directories).</p>

<p>&quot;-name GLOB&quot; File name matches specified GLOB
wildcard pattern. GLOB may need to be quoted to avoid
interpretation by the shell (just as with using
find(1)).</p>

<p>&quot;-iname GLOB&quot; Like &quot;-name&quot;, but the
match is case insensitive.</p>

<p>&quot;-path GLOB&quot; Path name matches specified GLOB
wildcard pattern.</p>

<p>&quot;-ipath GLOB&quot; Like &quot;-path&quot;, but the
match is case insensitive.</p>

<p>&quot;-perm PERM&quot; Low-order 9 bits of permission
match octal value PERM.</p>

<p>&quot;-perm -PERM&quot; The bits specified in PERM are
all set in files permissions.</p>

<p>&quot;-type X&quot; The files type matches perls
&quot;-X&quot; operator.</p>

<p>&quot;-fstype TYPE&quot; Filesystem of current path is
of type TYPE (only NFS/non-NFS distinction is
implemented).</p>

<p>&quot;-user USER&quot; True if USER is owner of
file.</p>

<p>&quot;-group GROUP&quot; True if files group is
GROUP.</p>

<p>&quot;-nouser&quot; True if files owner is not in
password database.</p>

<p>&quot;-nogroup&quot; True if files group is not in group
database.</p>

<p>&quot;-inum INUM&quot; True files inode number is
INUM.</p>

<p>&quot;-links N&quot; True if (hard) link count of file
matches N (see below).</p>

<p>&quot;-size N&quot; True if files size matches N (see
below) N is normally counted in 512-byte blocks, but a
suffix of &quot;c&quot; specifies that size should be
counted in characters (bytes) and a suffix of &quot;k&quot;
specifies that size should be counted in 1024-byte
blocks.</p>

<p>&quot;-atime N&quot; True if last-access time of file
matches N (measured in days) (see below).</p>

<p>&quot;-ctime N&quot; True if last-changed time of file s
inode matches N (measured in days, see below).</p>

<p>&quot;-mtime N&quot; True if last-modified time of file
matches N (measured in days, see below).</p>

<p>&quot;-newer FILE&quot; True if last-modified time of
file matches N.</p>

<p>&quot;-print&quot; Print out path of file (always true).
If none of &quot;-exec&quot;, &quot;-ls&quot;,
&quot;-print0&quot;, or &quot;-ok&quot; is specified, then
&quot;-print&quot; will be added implicitly.</p>

<p>&quot;-print0&quot; Like -print, but terminates with
instead of 0</p>

<p>&quot;-exec OPTIONS ;&quot; exec() the arguments in
OPTIONS in a subprocess; any occurrence of {} in OPTIONS
will first be substituted with the path of the current file.
Note that the command &quot;rm&quot; has been special-cased
to use perl s unlink() function instead (as an
optimization). The &quot;;&quot; must be passed as a
distinct argument, so it may need to be surrounded by
whitespace and/or quoted from interpretation by the shell
using a backslash (just as with using find(1)).</p>

<p>&quot;-ok OPTIONS ;&quot; Like -exec, but first prompts
user; if users response does not begin with a y, skip the
exec. The &quot;;&quot; must be passed as a distinct
argument, so it may need to be surrounded by whitespace
and/or quoted from interpretation by the shell using a
backslash (just as with using find(1)).</p>

<p>&quot;-eval EXPR&quot; Has the perl script eval() the
EXPR.</p>

<p>&quot;-ls&quot; Simulates &quot;-exec ls -dils {}
;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;-tar FILE&quot; Adds current output to tar-format
FILE.</p>

<p>&quot;-cpio FILE&quot; Adds current output to old-style
cpio-format FILE.</p>

<p>&quot;-ncpio FILE&quot; Adds current output to
&quot;new&quot;-style cpio-format FILE.</p>

<p>Predicates which take a numeric argument N can come in
three forms:</p>

<p>* N is prefixed with a +: match values greater than N *
N is prefixed with a -: match values less than N * N is not
prefixed with either + or -: match only values equal to
N</p>

<p>SEE ALSO find, File::Find.</p>
