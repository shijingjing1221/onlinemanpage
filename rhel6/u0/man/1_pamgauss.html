<p>NAME pamgauss - create a two dimensional gaussian
function as a PAM image</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pamgauss width height -sigma=number
[-maxval=number] [-tuple- type=string]</p>

<p>Minimum unique abbreviation of option is acceptable. You
may use dou- ble hyphens instead of single hyphen to denote
options. You may use white space in place of the equals sign
to separate an option name from its value.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES pamgauss 3 3 -sigma=.5 -tupletype=GRAYSCALE |
pamtopnm &gt;gauss.pgm pnmconvol -nooffset gauss.pgm
myimage.ppm &gt;blurred.ppm</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pamgauss generates a one-plane PAM image whose samples
are a gaussian function of their distance from the center of
the image. I.e. the sample value is highest in the center
and goes down, in a bell curve shape, as you move away from
the center.</p>

<p>The values are scaled so that the volume under the
surface of the two- dimensional Gaussian function is the
maxval of the image.</p>

<p>You can use this image as a convolution kernel with
pnmconvol to blur an image. (This technique is known as
Gaussian blurring).</p>

<p>width and height are the dimensions of the image that
pamgauss gener- ates. Mathematically speaking, they are the
domain of the two dimen- sional gaussian function.</p>

<p>The sum of all the samples is equal to the image s
maxval (within rounding error). This is true even if you
clip the Gaussian function by making the image too small. If
you want to be sure you get a whole Gaussian function, make
sure that you choose a sigma and image dimen- sions so that
if you made it any larger, the sample values at the edges
would be zero.</p>

<p>The output image is PAM. To make it usable with
pnmconvol, specify -tupletype=GRAYSCALE so pnmconvol can use
it as if it were PGM. You must use the -nooffset option on
pnmconvol because zero means zero in the PAM that pamgauss
generates.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -sigma=number This is the sigma parameter of the
Gaussian function (if it were a Gaussian probability
function, this would be its standard deviation). The higher
the number, the more spread out the function is. Normally,
you want to make this number low enough that the function
reaches zero value before the edge of your image.</p>

<p>number is in units of pixels.</p>

<p>This option is required. There is no default.</p>

<p>-maxval=number This is the maxval for the output image.
It defaults to 255.</p>

<p>-tupletype=string This is the value of the
&quot;tuple_type&quot; attribute of the created PAM image.
It can be any string up to 255 characters. If you dont
specify this, pamgauss generates a PAM with unspecified
tuple type.</p>
