<p>NAME cvscheck - Offline status report for files in a
checked-out CVS module.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS cvscheck [dir]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION cvscheck prints information about the status
of your local CVS checkout without communicating with the
server. This means it is extremely fast and does not require
a network connection.</p>

<p>The given directory and all of its subdirectories will
be processed re- cursively. If no directory is given, the
current directory and its re- cursed subdirectories will be
used.</p>

<p>Each file with an interesting status will be printed
with a status character in front of its name. The status
characters are as follows.</p>

<p>? foobar.c The file is not known to CVS</p>

<p>M foobar.c The file is definitely locally modified</p>

<p>m foobar.c The file might have local changes. You should
diff with the server to make sure.</p>

<p>C foobar.c The file has a CVS conflict and therefore
cannot be committed.</p>

<p>U foobar.c This file is in CVS but is missing in your
local checkout.</p>

<p>T foobar.c This file has an unusual sticky CVS tag.</p>

<p>A foobar.c You have done a cvs add for this file, but
have not yet commit- ted it.</p>

<p>R foobar.c You have done a cvs rm for this file, but
have not yet committed it.</p>

<p>This utility is part of the KDE Software Development
Kit.</p>
