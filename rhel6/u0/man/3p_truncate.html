<p>TRUNCATE(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual TRUNCATE(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME truncate - truncate a file to a specified
length</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>int truncate(const char *path, off_t length);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The truncate() function shall cause the
regular file named by path to have a size which shall be
equal to length bytes.</p>

<p>If the file previously was larger than length, the extra
data is dis- carded. If the file was previously shorter than
length, its size is increased, and the extended area appears
as if it were zero-filled.</p>

<p>The application shall ensure that the process has write
permission for the file.</p>

<p>If the request would cause the file size to exceed the
soft file size limit for the process, the request shall fail
and the implementation shall generate the SIGXFSZ signal for
the process.</p>

<p>This function shall not modify the file offset for any
open file descriptions associated with the file. Upon
successful completion, if the file size is changed, this
function shall mark for update the st_ctime and st_mtime
fields of the file, and the S_ISUID and S_ISGID bits of the
file mode may be cleared.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, truncate()
shall return 0. Otherwise, -1 shall be returned, and errno
set to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The truncate() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EINTR A signal was caught during execution.</p>

<p>EINVAL The length argument was less than 0.</p>

<p>EFBIG or EINVAL The length argument was greater than the
maximum file size.</p>

<p>EIO An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing
to a file system.</p>

<p>EACCES A component of the path prefix denies search
permission, or write permission is denied on the file.</p>

<p>EISDIR The named file is a directory.</p>

<p>ELOOP A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during
resolution of the path argument.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG The length of the path argument exceeds
{PATH_MAX} or a pathname component is longer than
{NAME_MAX}.</p>

<p>ENOENT A component of path does not name an existing
file or path is an empty string.</p>

<p>ENOTDIR A component of the path prefix of path is not a
directory.</p>

<p>EROFS The named file resides on a read-only file
system.</p>

<p>The truncate() function may fail if:</p>

<p>ELOOP More than {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic links were
encountered during resolution of the path argument.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG Pathname resolution of a symbolic link
produced an intermediate result whose length exceeds
{PATH_MAX}.</p>
