<p>GETHOSTBYADDR(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
GETHOSTBYADDR(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME gethostbyaddr, gethostbyname - network host
database functions</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;netdb.h&gt;</p>

<p>struct hostent *gethostbyaddr(const void *addr,
socklen_t len, int type); struct hostent
*gethostbyname(const char *name);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION These functions shall retrieve information
about hosts. This informa- tion is considered to be stored
in a database that can be accessed sequentially or randomly.
Implementation of this database is unspeci- fied.</p>

<p>Note: In many cases it is implemented by the Domain Name
System, as documented in RFC 1034, RFC 1035, and RFC
1886.</p>

<p>Entries shall be returned in hostent structures.</p>

<p>The gethostbyaddr() function shall return an entry
containing addresses of address family type for the host
with address addr. The len argument contains the length of
the address pointed to by addr. The gethost- byaddr()
function need not be reentrant. A function that is not
required to be reentrant is not required to be
thread-safe.</p>

<p>The gethostbyname() function shall return an entry
containing addresses of address family AF_INET for the host
with name name. The gethostby- name() function need not be
reentrant. A function that is not required to be reentrant
is not required to be thread-safe.</p>

<p>The addr argument of gethostbyaddr() shall be an in_addr
structure when type is AF_INET. It contains a binary format
(that is, not null-termi- nated) address in network byte
order. The gethostbyaddr() function is not guaranteed to
return addresses of address families other than AF_INET,
even when such addresses exist in the database.</p>

<p>If gethostbyaddr() returns successfully, then the
h_addrtype field in the result shall be the same as the type
argument that was passed to the function, and the
h_addr_list field shall list a single address that is a copy
of the addr argument that was passed to the function.</p>

<p>The name argument of gethostbyname() shall be a node
name; the behavior of gethostbyname() when passed a numeric
address string is unspecified. For IPv4, a numeric address
string shall be in the dotted-decimal nota- tion described
in inet_addr() .</p>

<p>If name is not a numeric address string and is an alias
for a valid host name, then gethostbyname() shall return
information about the host name to which the alias refers,
and name shall be included in the list of aliases
returned.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, these functions
shall return a pointer to a hostent structure if the
requested entry was found, and a null pointer if the end of
the database was reached or the requested entry was not
found.</p>

<p>Upon unsuccessful completion, gethostbyaddr() and
gethostbyname() shall set h_errno to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS These functions shall fail in the following
cases. The gethostbyaddr() and gethostbyname() functions
shall set h_errno to the value shown in the list below. Any
changes to errno are unspecified.</p>

<p>HOST_NOT_FOUND</p>

<p>No such host is known.</p>

<p>NO_DATA The server recognized the request and the name,
but no address is available. Another type of request to the
name server for the domain might return an answer.</p>

<p>NO_RECOVERY</p>

<p>An unexpected server failure occurred which cannot be
recovered.</p>

<p>TRY_AGAIN A temporary and possibly transient error
occurred, such as a failure of a server to respond.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The gethostbyaddr() and
gethostbyname() functions may return pointers to static
data, which may be overwritten by subsequent calls to any of
these functions.</p>

<p>The getaddrinfo() and getnameinfo() functions are
preferred over the gethostbyaddr() and gethostbyname()
functions.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS The gethostbyaddr() and
gethostbyname() functions may be withdrawn in a future
version.</p>
