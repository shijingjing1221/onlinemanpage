<p>DESCRIPTION These instructions allow you to generate
your image or report. If you dont use any graph elements, no
graph is generated. Similarly, no report is generated if you
dont use print options.</p>

<p>PRINT PRINT:vname:format[:strftime]</p>

<p>Depending on the context, either the value component or
the time component of a VDEF is printed using format. It is
an error to specify a vname generated by a DEF or CDEF.</p>

<p>Any text in format is printed literally with one
exception: The percent character introduces a formatter
string. This string can be:</p>

<p>For printing values:</p>

<p>%% just prints a literal % character</p>

<p>%#.#le prints numbers like 1.2346e+04. The optional
integers # denote field width and decimal precision.</p>

<p>%#.#lf prints numbers like 12345.6789, with optional
field width and precision.</p>

<p>%s place this after %le, %lf or %lg. This will be
replaced by the appropriate SI magnitude unit and the value
will be scaled accordingly (123456 -&gt; 123.456 k).</p>

<p>%S is similar to %s. It does, however, use a previously
defined magnitude unit. If there is no such unit yet, it
tries to define one (just like %s) unless the value is zero,
in which case the magnitude unit stays undefined. Thus,
formatter strings using %S and no %s will all use the same
magnitude unit except for zero values.</p>

<p>If you PRINT a VDEF value, you can also print the time
associated with it by appending the string :strftime to the
format. Note that rrdtool uses the strftime function of your
OSs C library. This means that the conversion specifier may
vary. Check the manual page if you are uncertain. The
following is a list of conversion specifiers usually
supported across the board.</p>

<p>%a The abbreviated weekday name according to the current
locale.</p>

<p>%A The full weekday name according to the current
locale.</p>

<p>%b The abbreviated month name according to the current
locale.</p>

<p>%B The full month name according to the current
locale.</p>

<p>%c The preferred date and time representation for the
current locale.</p>

<p>%d The day of the month as a decimal number (range 01 to
31).</p>

<p>%H The hour as a decimal number using a 24-hour clock
(range 00 to 23).</p>

<p>%I The hour as a decimal number using a 12-hour clock
(range 01 to 12).</p>

<p>%j The day of the year as a decimal number (range 001 to
366).</p>

<p>%m The month as a decimal number (range 01 to 12).</p>

<p>%M The minute as a decimal number (range 00 to 59).</p>

<p>%p Either AM or PM according to the given time value, or
the corresponding strings for the current locale. Noon is
treated as pm and midnight as am. Note that in many locales
and pm notation is unsupported and in such cases %p will
return an empty string.</p>

<p>%s The second as a decimal number (range 00 to 61).</p>

<p>%S The seconds since the epoch (1.1.1970) (libc
dependant non standard!)</p>

<p>%U The week number of the current year as a decimal
number, range 00 to 53, starting with the first Sunday as
the first day of week 01. See also %V and %W.</p>

<p>%V The ISO 8601:1988 week number of the current year as
a decimal number, range 01 to 53, where week 1 is the first
week that has at least 4 days in the current year, and with
Monday as the first day of the week. See also %U and %W.</p>

<p>%w The day of the week as a decimal, range 0 to 6,
Sunday being 0. See also %u.</p>

<p>%W The week number of the current year as a decimal
number, range 00 to 53, starting with the first Monday as
the first day of week 01.</p>

<p>%x The preferred date representation for the current
locale without the time.</p>

<p>%X The preferred time representation for the current
locale without the date.</p>

<p>%y The year as a decimal number without a century (range
00 to 99).</p>

<p>%Y The year as a decimal number including the
century.</p>

<p>%Z The time zone or name or abbreviation.</p>

<p>%% A literal % character.</p>

<p>PRINT:vname:CF:format</p>

<p>Deprecated. Use the new form of this command in new
scripts. The first form of this command is to be used with
CDEF vnames.</p>

<p>GRAPH GPRINT:vname:format</p>

<p>This is the same as &quot;PRINT&quot;, but printed
inside the graph.</p>

<p>GPRINT:vname:CF:format</p>

<p>Deprecated. Use the new form of this command in new
scripts. This is the same as &quot;PRINT&quot;, but printed
inside the graph.</p>

<p>COMMENT:text</p>

<p>Text is printed literally in the legend section of the
graph. Note that in RRDtool 1.2 you have to escape colons in
COMMENT text in the same way you have to escape them in
*PRINT commands by writin.</p>


<p>VRULE:time#color[:legend][:dashes[=on_s[,off_s[,on_s,off_s]...]][:dash-offset=offset]]</p>

<p>Draw a vertical line at time. Its color is composed from
three hexadecimal numbers specifying the rgb color
components (00 is off, FF is maximum) red, green and blue
followed by an optional alpha. Optionally, a legend box and
string is printed in the legend section. time may be a
number or a variable from a VDEF. It is an error to use
vnames from DEF or CDEF here. Dashed lines can be drawn
using the dashes modifier. See LINE for more details.</p>


<p>HRULE:value#color[:legend][:dashes[=on_s[,off_s[,on_s,off_s]...]][:dash-offset=offset]]</p>

<p>Draw a horizontal line at value. HRULE acts much like
LINE except that will have no effect on the scale of the
graph. If a HRULE is outside the graphing area it will just
not be visible.</p>


<p>LINE[width]:value[#color][:[legend][:STACK]][:dashes[=on_s[,off_s[,on_s,off_s]...]][:dash-offset=offset]]</p>

<p>Draw a line of the specified width onto the graph. width
can be a floating point number. If the color is not
specified, the drawing is done invisibly . This is useful
when stacking something else on top of this line. Also
optional is the legend box and string which will be printed
in the legend section if specified. The value can be
generated by DEF, VDEF, and CDEF. If the optional STACK
modifier is used, this line is stacked on top of the
previous element which can be a LINE or an AREA.</p>

<p>The dashes modifier enables dashed line style. Without
any further options a symmetric dashed line with a segment
length of 5 pixels will be drawn. The dash pattern can be
changed if the dashes= parameter is followed by either one
value or an even number (1, 2, 4, 6, ...) of positive
values. Each value provides the length of alternate on_s and
off_s portions of the stroke. The dash-offset parameter
specifies an offset into the pattern at which the stroke
begins.</p>

<p>When you do not specify a color, you cannot specify a
legend. Should you want to use STACK, use the
&quot;LINEx:&lt;value&gt;::STACK&quot; form.</p>

<p>AREA:value[#color][:[legend][:STACK]]</p>

<p>See LINE, however the area between the x-axis and the
line will be filled.</p>

<p>TICK:vname#rrggbb[aa][:fraction[:legend]]</p>

<p>Plot a tick mark (a vertical line) for each value of
vname that is non- zero and not *UNKNOWN*. The fraction
argument specifies the length of the tick mark as a fraction
of the y-axis; the default value is 0.1 (10% of the axis).
Note that the color specification is not optional. The TICK
marks normally start at the lower edge of the graphing area.
If the fraction is negative they start at the upper border
of the graphing area.</p>

<p>SHIFT:vname:offset</p>

<p>Using this command RRDtool will graph the following
elements with the specified offset. For instance, you can
specify an offset of ( 7*24*60*60 = ) 604800 seconds to
&quot;look back&quot; one week. Make sure to tell the viewer
of your graph you did this ... As with the other graphing
elements, you can specify a number or a variable here.</p>

<p>TEXTALIGN:{left|right|justified|center}</p>

<p>Labels are placed below the graph. When they overflow to
the left, they wrap to the next line. By default, lines are
justified left and right. The TEXTALIGN function lets you
change this default. This is a command and not an option, so
that you can change the default several times in your
argument list.</p>

<p>STACK:vname#color[:legend]</p>

<p>Deprecated. Use the STACK modifiers on the other
commands instead!</p>

<p>Some notes on stacking</p>

<p>When stacking, an element is not placed above the X-axis
but rather on top of the previous element. There must be
something to stack upon.</p>

<p>You can use an invisible LINE or AREA to stacked
upon.</p>

<p>An unknown value makes the entire stack unknown from
that moment on. You dont know where to begin (the unknown
value) and therefore do not know where to end.</p>

<p>If you want to make sure you will be displaying a
certain variable, make sure never to stack upon the unknown
value. Use a CDEF instruction with IF and UN to do so.</p>

<p>NOTES on legend arguments Escaping the colon A colon :
in a legend argument will mark the end of the legend. To
enter a : as part of a legend, the colon must be escaped
with a backslash . Beware that many environments process
backslashes themselves, so it may be necessary to write two
backslashes in order to one being passed onto rrd_graph.</p>

<p>String Formatting The text printed below the actual
graph can be formatted by appending special escape
characters at the end of a text. When ever such a character
occurs, all pending text is pushed onto the graph according
to the character specified.</p>

<p>r for Valid markers are:j for justified, for left
aligned, right aligned, and showing how to use centered
formatting.</p>

<p>n is a valid alias for since incomplete parsing in
earlier versions of rrdtool lead to this behavior and a
number of people has been using it.</p>

<p>Normally there are two space characters inserted between
every two items printed into the graph. The space following
a string can be suppressed by putting ag at the end of the
string. The g also ignores any space inside the string if it
is at the very end of the string. This can be used in
connection with %s to suppress empty unit strings.</p>

<p>GPRINT:a:MAX:%lf%s</p>

<p>A special case is COMMENT:which inserts some additional
vertical space before placing the next row of legends.</p>

<p>If you are using the proportional font in your graph,
you can use tab characters or the sequencet to line-up
legend elements. Note that the tabs inserted are relative to
the start of the current legend element!</p>

<p>Since RRDtool 1.3 is using Pango for rending text, you
can use Pango markup. Pango uses the xml span tags for
inline formatting instructions.:</p>

<p>A simple example of a marked-up string might be:</p>

<p>&lt;span foreground=&quot;blue&quot;
size=&quot;x-large&quot;&gt;Blue text&lt;/span&gt; is
&lt;i&gt;cool&lt;/i&gt;!</p>

<p>The complete list of attributes for the span tag (taken
from the pango documentation):</p>

<p>font_desc A font description string, such as &quot;Sans
Italic 12&quot;; note that any other span attributes will
override this description. So if you have &quot;Sans
Italic&quot; and also a style=&quot;normal&quot; attribute,
you will get Sans normal, not italic.</p>

<p>font_family A font family name</p>

<p>face Synonym for font_family</p>

<p>size Font size in 1024ths of a point, or one of the
absolute sizes xx-small, x-small, small, medium, large,
x-large, xx-large , or one of the relative sizes smaller or
larger. If you want to specify a absolute size, it s usually
easier to take advantage of the ability to specify a partial
font description using font_desc; you can use font_desc=
12.5 rather than size=12800.</p>

<p>style One of normal, oblique, italic</p>

<p>weight One of ultralight, light, normal, bold,
ultrabold, heavy, or a numeric weight</p>

<p>variant normal or smallcaps</p>

<p>stretch One of ultracondensed, extracondensed,
condensed, semicondensed, normal, semiexpanded, expanded,
extraexpanded, ultraexpanded</p>

<p>foreground An RGB color specification such as #00FF00 or
a color name such as red</p>

<p>background An RGB color specification such as #00FF00 or
a color name such as red</p>

<p>underline One of none, single, double, low, error</p>

<p>underline_color The color of underlines; an RGB color
specification such as #00FF00 or a color name such as
red</p>

<p>rise Vertical displacement, in 10000ths of an em. Can be
negative for subscript, positive for superscript.</p>

<p>strikethrough true or false whether to strike through
the text</p>

<p>strikethrough_color The color of strikethrough lines; an
RGB color specification such as #00FF00 or a color name such
as red</p>

<p>fallback true or false whether to enable fallback. If
disabled, then characters will only be used from the closest
matching font on the system. No fallback will be done to
other fonts on the system that might contain the characters
in the text. Fallback is enabled by default. Most
applications should not disable fallback.</p>

<p>lang A language code, indicating the text language</p>

<p>letter_spacing Inter-letter spacing in 1024ths of a
point.</p>

<p>gravity One of south, east, north, west, auto.</p>

<p>gravity_hint One of natural, strong, line.</p>

<p>To save you some typing, there are also some
shortcuts:</p>

<p>b Bold</p>

<p>big Makes font relatively larger, equivalent to &lt;span
size=&quot;larger&quot;&gt;</p>

<p>i Italic</p>

<p>s Strikethrough</p>

<p>sub Subscript</p>

<p>sup Superscript</p>

<p>small Makes font relatively smaller, equivalent to
&lt;span size=&quot;smaller&quot;&gt;</p>

<p>tt Monospace font</p>

<p>u Underline</p>
