<p>CAP_INIT(3) Linux Programmer s Manual CAP_INIT(3)</p>

<p>NAME cap_init, cap_free, cap_dup - capability data
object storage management</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/capability.h&gt;</p>

<p>cap_t cap_init(void);</p>

<p>int cap_free(void *obj_d);</p>

<p>cap_t cap_dup(cap_t cap_p);</p>

<p>Link with -lcap.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The capabilities associated with a file or
process are never edited directly. Instead, working storage
is allocated to contain a represen- tation of the capability
state. Capabilities are edited and manipu- lated only within
this working storage area. Once editing of the capa- bility
state is complete, the updated capability state is used to
replace the capability state associated with the file or
process.</p>

<p>cap_init() creates a capability state in working storage
and returns a pointer to the capability state. The initial
value of all flags are cleared. The caller should free any
releasable memory, when the capa- bility state in working
storage is no longer required, by calling cap_free() with
the cap_t as an argument.</p>

<p>cap_free() liberates any releasable memory that has been
allocated to the capability state identified by obj_d. The
obj_d argument may iden- tify either a cap_t entity, or a
char * entity allocated by the cap_to_text() function.</p>

<p>cap_dup() returns a duplicate capability state in
working storage given by the source object cap_p, allocating
any memory necessary, and returning a pointer to the newly
created capability state. Once dupli- cated, no operation on
either capability state affects the other in any way. When
the duplicated capability state in working storage is no
longer required, the caller should free any releasable
memory by call- ing cap_free() with the cap_t as an
argument.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE cap_init() and cap_dup() return a non-NULL
value on success, and NULL on failure.</p>

<p>cap_free() returns zero on success, and -1 on
failure.</p>

<p>On failure, errno is set to EINVAL or ENOMEM.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO These functions are specified in the
withdrawn POSIX.1e draft specifi- cation.</p>
