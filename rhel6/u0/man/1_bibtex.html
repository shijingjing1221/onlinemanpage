<p>BIBTEX(1) Web2C 7.5.6 BIBTEX(1)</p>

<p>NAME bibtex - make a bibliography for (La)TeX</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS bibtex [ -min-crossrefs=number ] [ -terse ] [
auxname ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page is not meant to be
exhaustive. The complete documen- tation for this version of
TeX can be found in the info file or manual Web2C: A TeX
implementation.</p>

<p>BibTeX reads the top-level auxiliary (.aux) file that
was output during the running of latex(1) or tex(1) and
creates a bibliography (.bbl) file that will be incorporated
into the document on subsequent runs of LaTeX or TeX. The
auxname on the command line must be given without the .aux
extension. If you dont give the auxname, the program prompts
you for it.</p>

<p>BibTeX looks up, in bibliographic database (.bib) files
specified byb the lography command, the entries specified by
the 0cite commands in the LaTeX or TeX source file. It
formats the information from those entries according to
instructions in a bibliog- b raphy style (.bst) file
(specified by the lographystyle command, and it outputs the
results to the .bbl file.</p>

<p>The LaTeX manual explains what a LaTeX source file must
contain to work with BibTeX. Appendix B of the manual
describes the format of the .bib files. The BibTeXing
document describes extensions and details of this format,
and it gives other useful hints for using BibTeX.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The -min-crossrefs option defines the minimum
number of crossref required for automatic inclusion of the
crossrefd entry on the cita- tion list; the default is two.
With the -terse option, BibTeX operates silently. Without
it, a banner and progress reports are printed on stdout.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT BibTeX searches the directories in the path
defined by the BSTINPUTS environment variable for .bst
files. If BSTINPUTS is not set, it uses the system default.
For .bib files, it uses the BIBINPUTS environment variable
if that is set, otherwise the default. See tex(1) for the
details of the searching.</p>

<p>If the environment variable TEXMFOUTPUT is set, BibTeX
attempts to put its output files in it, if they cannot be
put in the current directory. Again, see tex(1). No special
searching is done for the .aux file.</p>

<p>FILES *.bst Bibliography style files.</p>

<p>btxdoc.tex BibTeXing - LaTeXable documentation for
general BibTeX users</p>

<p>btxhak.tex Designing BibTeX Styles - LaTeXable
documentation for style designers</p>

<p>btxdoc.bib database file for those two documents</p>

<p>xampl.bib database file giving examples of all standard
entry types</p>

<p>btxbst.doc template file and documentation for the
standard styles</p>

<p>All those files should be available somewhere on your
system.</p>

<p>The host math.utah.edu has a vast collection of .bib
files available for anonymous ftp, including references for
all the standard TeX books and a complete bibliography for
TUGboat.</p>

<p>AUTHOR Oren Patashnik, Stanford University. This man
page describes the web2c version of BibTeX. Other ports of
BibTeX, such as Donald Knuths ver- sion using the Sun Pascal
compiler, do not have the same path searching
implementation, or the command-line options.</p>
