<p>NAME opendir, fdopendir - open a directory</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; #include
&lt;dirent.h&gt;</p>

<p>DIR *opendir(const char *name); DIR *fdopendir(int
fd);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The opendir() function opens a directory
stream corresponding to the directory name, and returns a
pointer to the directory stream. The stream is positioned at
the first entry in the directory.</p>

<p>The fdopendir() is like opendir(), but returns a
directory stream for the directory referred to by the open
file descriptor fd. After a suc- cessful call to
fdopendir(), fd is used internally by the implementa- tion,
and should not otherwise be used by the application.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The opendir() and fdopendir() functions
return a pointer to the direc- tory stream. On error, NULL
is returned, and errno is set appropri- ately.</p>

<p>ERRORS EACCES Permission denied.</p>

<p>EBADF fd is not a valid file descriptor opened for
reading.</p>

<p>EMFILE Too many file descriptors in use by process.</p>

<p>ENFILE Too many files are currently open in the
system.</p>

<p>ENOENT Directory does not exist, or name is an empty
string.</p>

<p>ENOMEM Insufficient memory to complete the
operation.</p>

<p>ENOTDIR name is not a directory.</p>

<p>VERSIONS fdopendir() is available in glibc since version
2.4.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO opendir() is present on SVr4, 4.3BSD, and
specified in POSIX.1-2001. fdopendir() is specified in
POSIX.1-2008.</p>

<p>NOTES The underlying file descriptor of the directory
stream can be obtained using dirfd(3).</p>

<p>The opendir() function sets the close-on-exec flag for
the file descriptor underlying the DIR *. The fdopendir()
function leaves the setting of the close-on-exec flag
unchanged for the file descriptor, fd. POSIX.1-200x leaves
it unspecified whether a successful call to fdopendir() will
set the close-on-exec flag for the file descriptor, fd.</p>
