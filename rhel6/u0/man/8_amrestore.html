<p>NAME amrestore - extract backup images from an Amanda
tape</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS amrestore [-r | -c | -C] [-b | blocksize] [-f |
fileno] [-l | label] [-p] [-h] tapedevice| holdingfile
[hostname [diskname [datestamp [hostname [diskname
[datestamp | ...]]]]]]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Amrestore extracts backup images from the
tape mounted on tapedevice or from the holding disk file
holdingfile that match hostname, diskname and datestamp
patterns given on the command line. The tape or holding file
must be in a format written by the amdump or amflush
program.</p>

<p>If diskname is not specified, all backups on the tape
for the previous hostname are candidates. If datestamp is
not specified, all backups on the tape for the previous
hostname and diskname are candidates. If no hostname,
diskname or datestamp are specified, every backup on the
tape is a candidate.</p>

<p>Hostname and diskname are special expressions described
in the &quot;HOST &amp; DISK EXPRESSION&quot; section of
amanda(8). Datestamp are special expression described in the
&quot;DATESTAMP EXPRESSION&quot; section of amanda(8). For
example, if diskname is &quot;rz[23]a&quot;, it would match
disks rz2a and rz3a.</p>

<p>Datestamp is useful if amflush writes multiple backup
runs to a single tape.</p>

<p>Unless -p is used, candidate backup images are extracted
to files in the current directory named:</p>

<p>hostname.diskname.datestamp.dumplevel</p>

<p>Amrestore doesn&acute;t use a changer, it restore from
the tape already loaded in the tapedevice.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -b Set the blocksize used to read the tape or
holding file. All holding files must be read with a
blocksize of 32 KBytes. Amrestore should normally be able to
determine the blocksize for tapes on its own and not need
this parameter.</p>

<p>The default is 32 KBytes.</p>

<p>-f Do a rewind followed by a fsf &lt;fileno&gt; before
trying to restore an image.</p>

<p>-l Check if we restoring from the tape with the right
label</p>

<p>-p Pipe output. The first matching backup image is sent
to standard output, which is normally a pipe to restore or
tar, then amrestore quits. It may be run again to continue
selecting backups to process. Make sure you specify the
no-rewind tapedevice when doing this.</p>

<p>Note: restore may report &quot;short read&quot; errors
when reading from a pipe. Most versions of restore support a
blocking factor option to let you set the read block size,
and you should set it to 2. See the example below.</p>

<p>-c Compress output using the fastest method the
compression program provides. Amrestore normally writes
output files in a format understood by restore or tar, even
if the backups on the tape are compressed. With the -c or -C
option, amrestore writes all files in compressed format,
even if the backups on the tape are not compressed. Output
file names will have a .Z or .gz extension depending on
whether compress or gzip is the preferred compression
program. This option is useful when the current directory
disk is small.</p>

<p>-C Compress output using the best method the compression
program provides (may be very CPU intensive). See the notes
above about the -c option.</p>

<p>-r Raw output. Backup images are output exactly as they
are on the tape, including the amdump headers. Output file
names will have a .RAW extension. This option is only useful
for debugging and other strange circumstances.</p>

<p>-h Header output. The tape header block is output at the
beginning of each file. This is like -r except -c or -C may
also be used to compress the result. Amrecover uses the
header to determine the restore program to use.</p>

<p>If a header is written (-r or -h), only 32 KBytes are
output regardless of the tape blocksize. This makes the
resulting image usable as a holding file.</p>

<p>-o configoption See the &quot;CONFIGURATION
OVERRIDE&quot; section in amanda(8).</p>

<p>EXAMPLES The following does an interactive restore of
disk rz3g from host seine, to restore particular files. Note
the use of the b option to restore, which causes it to read
in units of two 512-byte blocks (1 Kbyte) at a time. This
helps keep it from complaining about short reads.</p>

<p>% amrestore -p /dev/nrmt9 seine rz3g | restore -ivbf 2
-</p>

<p>The next example extracts all backup images for host
seine. This is the usual way to extract all data for a host
after a disk crash.</p>

<p>% amrestore /dev/nrmt9 seine</p>

<p>If the backup datestamp in the above example is 19910125
and seine has level 0 backups of disks rz1a and rz1g on the
tape, these files will be created in the current
directory:</p>

<p>seine.rz1a.19910125.0 seine.rz1g.19910125.0</p>

<p>You may also use amrestore to extract a backup image
from a holding disk file that has not yet been flushed to
tape:</p>

<p>% amrestore -p /amanda/20001119/seine.rz1a.2 | restore
-ivbf 2 -</p>

<p>Amrestore may be used to generate a listing of images on
a tape:</p>

<p>% mt -f /dev/nrmt9 rewind % amrestore -p /dev/nrmt9
no-such-host &gt; /dev/null</p>

<p>This asks amrestore to find images for host
no-such-host. It will not find any entries that match, but
along the way will report each image it skips.</p>

<p>CAVEATS GNU-tar must be used to restore files from
backup images created with the GNUTAR dumptype. Vendor tar
programs sometimes fail to read GNU tar images.</p>
