<p>RDMA_NOTIFY(3) Librdmacm Programmer s Manual
RDMA_NOTIFY(3)</p>

<p>NAME rdma_notify - Notifies the librdmacm of an
asynchronous event.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;rdma/rdma_cma.h&gt;</p>

<p>int rdma_notify (struct rdma_cm_id *id, enum
ibv_event_type event);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS id RDMA identifier.</p>

<p>event Asynchronous event.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Used to notify the librdmacm of asynchronous
events that have occurred on a QP associated with the
rdma_cm_id.</p>

<p>NOTES Asynchronous events that occur on a QP are
reported through the users device event handler. This
routine is used to notify the librdmacm of communication
events. In most cases, use of this routine is not neces-
sary, however if connection establishment is done out of
band (such as done through Infiniband), its possible to
receive data on a QP that is not yet considered connected.
This routine forces the connection into an established state
in this case in order to handle the rare situation where the
connection never forms on its own. Events that should be
reported to the CM are: IB_EVENT_COMM_EST.</p>
