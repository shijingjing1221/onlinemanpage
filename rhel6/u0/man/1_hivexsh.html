<p>hivexsh(1) Windows Registry hivexsh(1)</p>

<p>NAME hivexsh - Windows Registry hive shell</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS hivexsh [-options] [hivefile]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program provides a simple shell for
navigating Windows Registry hive files. It uses the hivex
library for access to these binary files.</p>

<p>Firstly you will need to provide a hive file from a
Windows operating system. The hive files are usually located
in &quot;C:Windowstem32and have names like
&quot;software&quot;, &quot;system&quot; etc (without any
file extension). For more information about hive files, read
hivex(3). For information about downloading files from
virtual machines, read virt-cat(1) and guestfish(1).</p>

<p>You can provide the name of the hive file to examine on
the command line. For example:</p>

<p>hivexsh software</p>

<p>Or you can start &quot;hivexsh&quot; without any
arguments, and immediately use the &quot;load&quot; command
to load a hive:</p>

<p>$ hivexsh</p>

<p>Welcome to hivexsh, the hivex interactive shell for
examining Windows Registry binary hive files.</p>

<p>Type: &rsquo;help&rsquo; for help with commands
&rsquo;quit&rsquo; to quit the shell</p>

<p>&gt; load software software&gt;</p>

<p>Navigate through the hives keys using the &quot;cd&quot;
command, as if it contained a filesystem, and use
&quot;ls&quot; to list the subkeys of the current key. Other
commands are listed below.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -d Enable lots of debug messages. If you find a
Registry file that this program cannot parse, please enable
this option and post the complete output and the Registry
hive file in your bug report.</p>

<p>-f filename Read commands from &quot;filename&quot;
instead of stdin. To write a hivexsh script, use:</p>

<p>#!/usr/bin/hivexsh -f</p>

<p>-w If this option is given, then writes are allowed to
the hive (see &quot;commit&quot; command below, and the
discussion of modifying hives in &quot;WRITING TO HIVE
FILES&quot; in hivex(3)).</p>

<p>Important Note: Even if you specify this option, nothing
is written to a hive unless you call the &quot;commit&quot;
command. If you exit the shell without committing, all
changes will be discarded.</p>

<p>If this option is not given, then write commands are
disabled.</p>

<p>COMMANDS add name Add a subkey named &quot;name&quot;
below the current node. The name may contain spaces and
punctuation characters, and does not need to be quoted.</p>

<p>The new key will have no subkeys and no values (see
&quot;setval&quot;).</p>

<p>There must be no existing subkey called
&quot;name&quot;, or this command will fail. To replace an
existing subkey, delete it first like this:</p>

<p>cd name del</p>

<p>cd path Change to the subkey &quot;path&quot;. Use
Windows-style backslashes to separate path elements, and
start with a backslash in order to start from the root of
the hive. For example:</p>

<p>cd moves from the root node, to the &quot;Classes&quot;
node, to the &quot;*&quot; node. If you were already at the
root node, you could do this instead:</p>

<p>cd Classes</p>

<p>or even:</p>

<p>cd Classes cd *</p>

<p>Path elements (node names) are matched case
insensitively, and characters like space, &quot;*&quot;, and
&quot;?&quot; have no special significance.</p>

<p>&quot;cd ..&quot; may be used to go to the parent
directory.</p>

<p>&quot;cd&quot; without any arguments prints the current
path.</p>

<p>Be careful with &quot;cd undocumented behaviour where it
will think the final backslash is a continuation (it reads
the next line of input and appends it). Put a single space
after the backslash.</p>

<p>close | unload Close the currently loaded hive.</p>

<p>If you modified the hive, all uncommitted writes are
lost when you call this command (or if the shell exits). You
have to call &quot;commit&quot; to write changes.</p>

<p>commit [newfile] Commit changes to the hive. If the
optional &quot;newfile&quot; parameter is supplied, then the
hive is written to that file, else the original file is
overwritten.</p>

<p>Note that you have to specify the &quot;-w&quot; flag,
otherwise no writes are allowed.</p>

<p>del Delete the current node and everything beneath it.
The current directory is moved up one level (as if you did
&quot;cd ..&quot;) after this command.</p>

<p>You cannot delete the root node.</p>

<p>exit | quit Exit the shell.</p>

<p>load hivefile Load the binary hive named
&quot;hivefile&quot;. The currently loaded hive, if any, is
closed. The current directory is changed back to the root
node.</p>

<p>ls List the subkeys of the current hive Registry key.
Note this command does not take any arguments.</p>

<p>lsval [key] List the (key, value) pairs of the current
hive Registry key. If no argument is given then all pairs
are displayed. If &quot;key&quot; is given, then the value
of the named key is displayed. If &quot;@&quot; is given,
then the value of the default key is displayed.</p>

<p>setval nrvals This command replaces all (key, value)
pairs at the current node with the values in subsequent
input. &quot;nrvals&quot; is the number of values (ie. (key,
value) pairs), and any existing values at this node are
deleted. So &quot;setval 0&quot; just deletes any values at
the current node.</p>

<p>The command reads 2 * nrvals lines of input, with each
pair of lines of input corresponding to a key and a value to
add.</p>

<p>For example, the following setval command replaces
whatever is at the current node with two (key, value) pairs.
The default key is set to the UTF16-LE-encoded string
&quot;abcd&quot;. The other value is named
&quot;ANumber&quot; and is a little-endian DWORD
0x12345678.</p>

<p>setval 2 @ string:abcd ANumber dword:12345678</p>

<p>The first line of each pair is the key (the special key
&quot;@&quot; means the default key, but you can also use a
blank line).</p>

<p>The second line of each pair is the value, which has a
special format &quot;type:value&quot; with possible types
summarized in the table below:</p>

<p>none No data is stored, and the type is set to 0.</p>

<p>string:abc &quot;abc&quot; is stored as a
UTF16-LE-encoded string (type 1). Note that only 7 bit ASCII
strings are supported as input.</p>

<p>expandstring:... Same as string but with type 2.</p>

<p>dword:0x01234567 A DWORD (type 4) with the hex value
0x01234567. You can also use decimal or octal numbers
here.</p>

<p>qword:0x0123456789abcdef A QWORD (type 11) with the hex
value 0x0123456789abcdef. You can also use decimal or octal
numbers here.</p>

<p>hex:&lt;type&gt;:&lt;hexbytes&gt;
hex:1:41,00,42,00,43,00,44,00,00,00 This is the generic way
to enter any value. &lt;type&gt; is the integer value type.
&lt;hexbytes&gt; is a list of pairs of hex digits which are
treated as bytes. (Any non-hex-digits here are ignored, so
you can separate bytes with commas or spaces if you
want).</p>
