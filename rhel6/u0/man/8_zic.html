<p>NAME zic - timezone compiler</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS zic [ -v ] [ -d directory ] [ -l localtime ] [
-p posixrules ] [ -L leapsecondfilename ] [ -s ] [ -y
command ] [ filename ... ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Zic reads text from the file(s) named on the
command line and creates the time conversion information
files specified in this input. If a filename is -, the
standard input is read.</p>

<p>These options are available:</p>

<p>-d directory Create time conversion information files in
the named directory rather than in the standard directory
named below.</p>

<p>-l timezone Use the given timezone as local time. Zic
will act as if the input contained a link line of the
form</p>

<p>Link timezone localtime</p>

<p>-p timezone Use the given timezone s rules when handling
POSIX-format time- zone environment variables. Zic will act
as if the input con- tained a link line of the form</p>

<p>Link timezone posixrules</p>

<p>-L leapsecondfilename Read leap second information from
the file with the given name. If this option is not used, no
leap second information appears in output files.</p>

<p>-v Complain if a year that appears in a data file is
outside the range of years representable by time(2)
values.</p>

<p>-s Limit time values stored in output files to values
that are the same whether they re taken to be signed or
unsigned. You can use this option to generate
SVVS-compatible files.</p>

<p>-y command Use the given command rather than yearistype
when checking year types (see below).</p>

<p>Input lines are made up of fields. Fields are separated
from one another by any number of white space characters.
Leading and trailing white space on input lines is ignored.
An unquoted sharp character (#) in the input introduces a
comment which extends to the end of the line the sharp
character appears on. White space characters and sharp char-
acters may be enclosed in double quotes (&quot;) if theyre
to be used as part of a field. Any line that is blank (after
comment stripping) is ignored. Non-blank lines are expected
to be of one of three types: rule lines, zone lines, and
link lines.</p>

<p>A rule line has the form</p>

<p>Rule NAME FROM TO TYPE IN ON AT SAVE LETTER/S</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>Rule US 1967 1973 - Apr lastSun 2:00 1:00 D</p>

<p>The fields that make up a rule line are:</p>

<p>NAME Gives the (arbitrary) name of the set of rules this
rule is part of.</p>

<p>FROM Gives the first year in which the rule applies. Any
integer year can be supplied; the Gregorian calendar is
assumed. The word minimum (or an abbreviation) means the
minimum year repre- sentable as an integer. The word maximum
(or an abbreviation) means the maximum year representable as
an integer. Rules can describe times that are not
representable as time values, with the unrepresentable times
ignored; this allows rules to be portable among hosts with
differing time value types.</p>

<p>TO Gives the final year in which the rule applies. In
addition to minimum and maximum (as above), the word only
(or an abbrevia- tion) may be used to repeat the value of
the FROM field.</p>

<p>TYPE Gives the type of year in which the rule applies.
If TYPE is - then the rule applies in all years between FROM
and TO inclu- sive. If TYPE is something else, then zic
executes the command yearistype year type to check the type
of a year: an exit status of zero is taken to mean that the
year is of the given type; an exit status of one is taken to
mean that the year is not of the given type.</p>

<p>IN Names the month in which the rule takes effect. Month
names may be abbreviated.</p>

<p>ON Gives the day on which the rule takes effect.
Recognized forms include:</p>

<p>5 the fifth of the month lastSun the last Sunday in the
month lastMon the last Monday in the month Sun&gt;=8 first
Sunday on or after the eighth Sun&lt;=25 last Sunday on or
before the 25th</p>

<p>Names of days of the week may be abbreviated or spelled
out in full. Note that there must be no spaces within the ON
field.</p>

<p>AT Gives the time of day at which the rule takes effect.
Recog- nized forms include:</p>

<p>2 time in hours 2:00 time in hours and minutes 15:00
24-hour format time (for times after noon) 1:28:14 time in
hours, minutes, and seconds - equivalent to 0</p>

<p>where hour 0 is midnight at the start of the day, and
hour 24 is midnight at the end of the day. Any of these
forms may be followed by the letter w if the given time is
local &quot;wall clock&quot; time, s if the given time is
local &quot;standard&quot; time, or u (or g or z) if the
given time is universal time; in the absence of an
indicator, wall clock time is assumed.</p>

<p>SAVE Gives the amount of time to be added to local
standard time when the rule is in effect. This field has the
same format as the AT field (although, of course, the w and
s suffixes are not used).</p>

<p>LETTER/S Gives the &quot;variable part&quot; (for
example, the &quot;S&quot; or &quot;D&quot; in
&quot;EST&quot; or &quot;EDT&quot;) of timezone
abbreviations to be used when this rule is in effect. If
this field is -, the variable part is null.</p>

<p>A zone line has the form</p>

<p>Zone NAME GMTOFF RULES/SAVE FORMAT [UNTIL]</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>Zone Australia/Adelaide 9:30 Aus CST 1971 Oct 31
2:00</p>

<p>The fields that make up a zone line are:</p>

<p>NAME The name of the timezone. This is the name used in
creating the time conversion information file for the
zone.</p>

<p>GMTOFF The amount of time to add to UTC to get standard
time in this zone. This field has the same format as the AT
and SAVE fields of rule lines; begin the field with a minus
sign if time must be subtracted from UTC.</p>

<p>RULES/SAVE The name of the rule(s) that apply in the
timezone or, alter- nately, an amount of time to add to
local standard time. If this field is - then standard time
always applies in the timezone.</p>

<p>FORMAT The format for timezone abbreviations in this
timezone. The pair of characters %s is used to show where
the &quot;variable part&quot; of the timezone abbreviation
goes. Alternately, a slash (/) separates standard and
daylight abbreviations.</p>

<p>UNTIL The time at which the UTC offset or the rule(s)
change for a location. It is specified as a year, a month, a
day, and a time of day. If this is specified, the timezone
information is gener- ated from the given UTC offset and
rule change until the time specified. The month, day, and
time of day have the same format as the IN, ON, and AT
columns of a rule; trailing columns can be omitted, and
default to the earliest possible value for the miss- ing
columns.</p>

<p>The next line must be a &quot;continuation&quot; line;
this has the same form as a zone line except that the string
&quot;Zone&quot; and the name are omitted, as the
continuation line will place information starting at the
time specified as the UNTIL field in the previous line in
the file used by the previous line. Continuation lines may
contain an UNTIL field, just as zone lines do, indicating
that the next line is a further continuation.</p>

<p>A link line has the form</p>

<p>Link LINK-FROM LINK-TO</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>Link Europe/Istanbul Asia/Istanbul</p>

<p>The LINK-FROM field should appear as the NAME field in
some zone line; the LINK-TO field is used as an alternate
name for that zone.</p>

<p>Except for continuation lines, lines may appear in any
order in the input.</p>

<p>Lines in the file that describes leap seconds have the
following form:</p>

<p>Leap YEAR MONTH DAY HH:MM:SS CORR R/S</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>Leap 1974 Dec 31 23:59:60 + S</p>

<p>The YEAR, MONTH, DAY, and HH:MM:SS fields tell when the
leap second happened. The CORR field should be &quot;+&quot;
if a second was added or &quot;-&quot; if a second was
skipped. The R/S field should be (an abbreviation of)
&quot;Stationary&quot; if the leap second time given by the
other fields should be interpreted as UTC or (an
abbreviation of) &quot;Rolling&quot; if the leap second time
given by the other fields should be interpreted as local
wall clock time.</p>

<p>FILES /usr/local/etc/zoneinfo standard directory used
for created files</p>

<p>NOTES For areas with more than two types of local time,
you may need to use local standard time in the AT field of
the earliest transition times rule to ensure that the
earliest transition time recorded in the com- piled file is
correct.</p>
