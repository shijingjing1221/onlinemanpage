<p>SDL_AddTimer(3) SDL API Reference SDL_AddTimer(3)</p>

<p>NAME SDL_AddTimer - Add a timer which will call a
callback after the speci- fied number of milliseconds has
elapsed.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &quot;SDL.h&quot;</p>

<p>SDL_TimerID SDL_AddTimer(Uint32 interval,
SDL_NewTimerCallback call- back, void *param);</p>

<p>CALLBACK /* type definition for the &quot;new&quot;
timer callback function */ typedef Uint32
(*SDL_NewTimerCallback)(Uint32 interval, void *param);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Adds a callback function to be run after the
specified number of mil- liseconds has elapsed. The callback
function is passed the current timer interval and the user
supplied parameter from the SDL_AddTimer call and returns
the next timer interval. If the returned value from the
callback is the same as the one passed in, the periodic
alarm con- tinues, otherwise a new alarm is scheduled.</p>

<p>To cancel a currently running timer call SDL_RemoveTimer
with the timer ID returned from SDL_AddTimer.</p>

<p>The timer callback function may run in a different
thread than your main program, and so shouldn t call any
functions from within itself. You may always call
SDL_PushEvent, however.</p>

<p>The granularity of the timer is platform-dependent, but
you should count on it being at least 10 ms as this is the
most common number. This means that if you request a 16 ms
timer, your callback will run approximately 20 ms later on
an unloaded system. If you wanted to set a flag signaling a
frame update at 30 frames per second (every 33 ms), you
might set a timer for 30 ms (see example below). If you use
this function, you need to pass SDL_INIT_TIMER to
SDL_Init.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Returns an ID value for the added timer or
NULL if there was an error.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES my_timer_id = SDL_AddTimer((33/10)*10,
my_callbackfunc, my_callback_param);</p>

<p>SEE ALSO SDL_RemoveTimer, SDL_PushEvent</p>
