<p>NAME options - Standard options supported by widgets
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual entry describes the common
configuration options supported by widgets in the Tk
toolkit. Every widget does not necessarily sup- port every
option (see the manual entries for individual widgets for a
list of the standard options supported by that widget), but
if a widget does support an option with one of the names
listed below, then the option has exactly the effect
described below.</p>

<p>In the descriptions below, Command-Line Name refers to
the switch used in class commands and configure widget
commands to set this value. For example, if an option s
command-line switch is -foreground and there exists a widget
.a.b.c, then the command .a.b.c configure -foreground black
may be used to specify the value black for the option in the
widget .a.b.c. Command-line switches may be abbreviated, as
long as the abbreviation is unambiguous. Database Name
refers to the options name in the option database (e.g. in
.Xdefaults files). Database Class refers to the option s
class value in the option database.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-activebackground Database Name:
activeBackground Database Class: Foreground</p>

<p>Specifies background color to use when drawing active
elements. An element (a widget or portion of a widget) is
active if the mouse cursor is positioned over the element
and pressing a mouse button will cause some action to occur.
If strict Motif compli- ance has been requested by setting
the tk_strictMotif variable, this option will normally be
ignored; the normal background color will be used instead.
For some elements on Windows and Macintosh systems, the
active color will only be used while mouse button 1 is
pressed over the element.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-activeborderwidth Database Name:
activeBorderWidth Database Class: BorderWidth</p>

<p>Specifies a non-negative value indicating the width of
the 3-D border drawn around active elements. See above for
definition of active elements. The value may have any of the
forms accept- able to Tk_GetPixels. This option is typically
only available in widgets displaying more than one element
at a time (e.g. menus but not buttons).</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-activeforeground Database Name:
activeForeground Database Class: Background</p>

<p>Specifies foreground color to use when drawing active
elements. See above for definition of active elements.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-anchor Database Name: anchor Database
Class: Anchor</p>

<p>Specifies how the information in a widget (e.g. text or
a bitmap) is to be displayed in the widget. Must be one of
the values n, ne, e, se, s, sw, w, nw, or center. For
example, nw means display the information such that its
top-left corner is at the top-left corner of the widget.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-background or -bg Database Name:
background Database Class: Background</p>

<p>Specifies the normal background color to use when
displaying the widget.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-bitmap Database Name: bitmap Database
Class: Bitmap</p>

<p>Specifies a bitmap to display in the widget, in any of
the forms acceptable to Tk_GetBitmap. The exact way in which
the bitmap is displayed may be affected by other options
such as anchor or justify. Typically, if this option is
specified then it over- rides other options that specify a
textual value to display in the widget but this is
controlled by the compound option; the bitmap option may be
reset to an empty string to re-enable a text display. In
widgets that support both bitmap and image options, image
will usually override bitmap.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-borderwidth or -bd Database Name:
borderWidth Database Class: BorderWidth</p>

<p>Specifies a non-negative value indicating the width of
the 3-D border to draw around the outside of the widget (if
such a bor- der is being drawn; the relief option typically
determines this). The value may also be used when drawing
3-D effects in the interior of the widget. The value may
have any of the forms acceptable to Tk_GetPixels.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-cursor Database Name: cursor Database
Class: Cursor</p>

<p>Specifies the mouse cursor to be used for the widget.
The value may have any of the forms acceptable to
Tk_GetCursor. In addi- tion, if an empty string is
specified, it indicates that the widget should defer to its
parent for cursor specification.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-compound Database Name: compound
Database Class: Compound</p>

<p>Specifies if the widget should display text and
bitmaps/images at the same time, and if so, where the
bitmap/image should be placed relative to the text. Must be
one of the values none, bottom, top, left, right, or center.
For example, the (default) value none specifies that the
bitmap or image should (if defined) be displayed instead of
the text, the value left speci- fies that the bitmap or
image should be displayed to the left of the text, and the
value center specifies that the bitmap or image should be
displayed on top of the text.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-disabledforeground Database Name:
disabledForeground Database Class: DisabledForeground</p>

<p>Specifies foreground color to use when drawing a
disabled ele- ment. If the option is specified as an empty
string (which is typically the case on monochrome displays),
disabled elements are drawn with the normal foreground color
but they are dimmed by drawing them with a stippled fill
pattern.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-exportselection Database Name:
exportSelection Database Class: ExportSelection</p>

<p>Specifies whether or not a selection in the widget
should also be the X selection. The value may have any of
the forms accepted by Tcl_GetBoolean, such as true, false,
0, 1, yes, or no. If the selection is exported, then
selecting in the widget deselects the current X selection,
selecting outside the widget deselects any widget selection,
and the widget will respond to selection retrieval requests
when it has a selection. The default is usually for widgets
to export selections.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-font Database Name: font Database
Class: Font</p>

<p>Specifies the font to use when drawing text inside the
widget. The value may have any of the forms described in the
font manual page under FONT DESCRIPTION.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-foreground or -fg Database Name:
foreground Database Class: Foreground</p>

<p>Specifies the normal foreground color to use when
displaying the widget.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-highlightbackground Database Name:
highlightBackground Database Class: HighlightBackground</p>

<p>Specifies the color to display in the traversal
highlight region when the widget does not have the input
focus.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-highlightcolor Database Name:
highlightColor Database Class: HighlightColor</p>

<p>Specifies the color to use for the traversal highlight
rectangle that is drawn around the widget when it has the
input focus.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-highlightthickness Database Name:
highlightThickness Database Class: HighlightThickness</p>

<p>Specifies a non-negative value indicating the width of
the high- light rectangle to draw around the outside of the
widget when it has the input focus. The value may have any
of the forms acceptable to Tk_GetPixels. If the value is
zero, no focus highlight is drawn around the widget.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-image Database Name: image Database
Class: Image</p>

<p>Specifies an image to display in the widget, which must
have been created with the image create command. Typically,
if the image option is specified then it overrides other
options that specify a bitmap or textual value to display in
the widget, though this is controlled by the compound
option; the image option may be reset to an empty string to
re-enable a bitmap or text display.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-insertbackground Database Name:
insertBackground Database Class: Foreground</p>

<p>Specifies the color to use as background in the area
covered by the insertion cursor. This color will normally
override either the normal background for the widget (or the
selection back- ground if the insertion cursor happens to
fall in the selec- tion).</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-insertborderwidth Database Name:
insertBorderWidth Database Class: BorderWidth</p>

<p>Specifies a non-negative value indicating the width of
the 3-D border to draw around the insertion cursor. The
value may have any of the forms acceptable to
Tk_GetPixels.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-insertofftime Database Name:
insertOffTime Database Class: OffTime</p>

<p>Specifies a non-negative integer value indicating the
number of milliseconds the insertion cursor should remain
off in each blink cycle. If this option is zero then the
cursor does not blink: it is on all the time.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-insertontime Database Name:
insertOnTime Database Class: OnTime</p>

<p>Specifies a non-negative integer value indicating the
number of milliseconds the insertion cursor should remain on
in each blink cycle.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-insertwidth Database Name:
insertWidth Database Class: InsertWidth</p>

<p>Specifies a value indicating the total width of the
insertion cursor. The value may have any of the forms
acceptable to Tk_GetPixels. If a border has been specified
for the insertion cursor (using the insertBorderWidth
option), the border will be drawn inside the width specified
by the insertWidth option.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-jump Database Name: jump Database
Class: Jump</p>

<p>For widgets with a slider that can be dragged to adjust
a value, such as scrollbars, this option determines when
notifications are made about changes in the value. The
option s value must be a boolean of the form accepted by
Tcl_GetBoolean. If the value is false, updates are made
continuously as the slider is dragged. If the value is true,
updates are delayed until the mouse button is released to
end the drag; at that point a sin- gle notification is made
(the value jumps rather than changing smoothly).</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-justify Database Name: justify
Database Class: Justify</p>

<p>When there are multiple lines of text displayed in a
widget, this option determines how the lines line up with
each other. Must be one of left, center, or right. Left
means that the lines left edges all line up, center means
that the lines cen- ters are aligned, and right means that
the lines right edges line up.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-orient Database Name: orient Database
Class: Orient</p>

<p>For widgets that can lay themselves out with either a
horizontal or vertical orientation, such as scrollbars, this
option speci- fies which orientation should be used. Must be
either horizon- tal or vertical or an abbreviation of one of
these.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-padx Database Name: padX Database
Class: Pad</p>

<p>Specifies a non-negative value indicating how much extra
space to request for the widget in the X-direction. The
value may have any of the forms acceptable to Tk_GetPixels.
When comput- ing how large a window it needs, the widget
will add this amount to the width it would normally need (as
determined by the width of the things displayed in the
widget); if the geometry manager can satisfy this request,
the widget will end up with extra internal space to the left
and/or right of what it displays inside. Most widgets only
use this option for padding text: if they are displaying a
bitmap or image, then they usually ignore padding
options.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-pady Database Name: padY Database
Class: Pad</p>

<p>Specifies a non-negative value indicating how much extra
space to request for the widget in the Y-direction. The
value may have any of the forms acceptable to Tk_GetPixels.
When comput- ing how large a window it needs, the widget
will add this amount to the height it would normally need
(as determined by the height of the things displayed in the
widget); if the geometry manager can satisfy this request,
the widget will end up with extra internal space above
and/or below what it displays inside. Most widgets only use
this option for padding text: if they are displaying a
bitmap or image, then they usually ignore padding
options.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-relief Database Name: relief Database
Class: Relief</p>

<p>Specifies the 3-D effect desired for the widget.
Acceptable values are raised, sunken, flat, ridge, solid,
and groove. The value indicates how the interior of the
widget should appear relative to its exterior; for example,
raised means the inte- rior of the widget should appear to
protrude from the screen, relative to the exterior of the
widget.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-repeatdelay Database Name:
repeatDelay Database Class: RepeatDelay</p>

<p>Specifies the number of milliseconds a button or key
must be held down before it begins to auto-repeat. Used, for
example, on the up- and down-arrows in scrollbars.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-repeatinterval Database Name:
repeatInterval Database Class: RepeatInterval</p>

<p>Used in conjunction with repeatDelay: once auto-repeat
begins, this option determines the number of milliseconds
between auto- repeats.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-selectbackground Database Name:
selectBackground Database Class: Foreground</p>

<p>Specifies the background color to use when displaying
selected items.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-selectborderwidth Database Name:
selectBorderWidth Database Class: BorderWidth</p>

<p>Specifies a non-negative value indicating the width of
the 3-D border to draw around selected items. The value may
have any of the forms acceptable to Tk_GetPixels.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-selectforeground Database Name:
selectForeground Database Class: Background</p>

<p>Specifies the foreground color to use when displaying
selected items.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-setgrid Database Name: setGrid
Database Class: SetGrid</p>

<p>Specifies a boolean value that determines whether this
widget controls the resizing grid for its top-level window.
This option is typically used in text widgets, where the
information in the widget has a natural size (the size of a
character) and it makes sense for the window s dimensions to
be integral num- bers of these units. These natural window
sizes form a grid. If the setGrid option is set to true then
the widget will commu- nicate with the window manager so
that when the user interac- tively resizes the top-level
window that contains the widget, the dimensions of the
window will be displayed to the user in grid units and the
window size will be constrained to integral numbers of grid
units. See the section GRIDDED GEOMETRY MANAGE- MENT in the
wm manual entry for more details.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-takefocus Database Name: takeFocus
Database Class: TakeFocus</p>

<p>Determines whether the window accepts the focus during
keyboard traversal (e.g., Tab and Shift-Tab). Before setting
the focus to a window, the traversal scripts consult the
value of the takeFocus option. A value of 0 means that the
window should be skipped entirely during keyboard traversal.
1 means that the window should receive the input focus as
long as it is viewable (it and all of its ancestors are
mapped). An empty value for the option means that the
traversal scripts make the decision about whether or not to
focus on the window: the current algo- rithm is to skip the
window if it is disabled, if it has no key bindings, or if
it is not viewable. If the value has any other form, then
the traversal scripts take the value, append the name of the
window to it (with a separator space), and evaluate the
resulting string as a Tcl script. The script must return 0,
1, or an empty string: a 0 or 1 value specifies whether the
window will receive the input focus, and an empty string
results in the default decision described above. Note: this
interpretation of the option is defined entirely by the Tcl
scripts that implement traversal: the widget implementations
ignore the option entirely, so you can change its meaning if
you redefine the key- board traversal scripts.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-text Database Name: text Database
Class: Text</p>

<p>Specifies a string to be displayed inside the widget.
The way in which the string is displayed depends on the
particular wid- get and may be determined by other options,
such as anchor or justify.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-textvariable Database Name:
textVariable Database Class: Variable</p>

<p>Specifies the name of a variable. The value of the
variable is a text string to be displayed inside the widget;
if the vari- able value changes then the widget will
automatically update itself to reflect the new value. The
way in which the string is displayed in the widget depends
on the particular widget and may be determined by other
options, such as anchor or justify.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-troughcolor Database Name:
troughColor Database Class: Background</p>

<p>Specifies the color to use for the rectangular trough
areas in widgets such as scrollbars and scales. This option
is ignored for scrollbars on Windows (native widget does not
recognize this option).</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-underline Database Name: underline
Database Class: Underline</p>

<p>Specifies the integer index of a character to underline
in the widget. This option is used by the default bindings
to imple- ment keyboard traversal for menu buttons and menu
entries. 0 corresponds to the first character of the text
displayed in the widget, 1 to the next character, and so
on.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-wraplength Database Name: wrapLength
Database Class: WrapLength</p>

<p>For widgets that can perform word-wrapping, this option
speci- fies the maximum line length. Lines that would exceed
this length are wrapped onto the next line, so that no line
is longer than the specified length. The value may be
specified in any of the standard forms for screen distances.
If this value is less than or equal to 0 then no wrapping is
done: lines will break only at newline characters in the
text.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-xscrollcommand Database Name:
xScrollCommand Database Class: ScrollCommand</p>

<p>Specifies the prefix for a command used to communicate
with hor- izontal scrollbars. When the view in the widgets
window changes (or whenever anything else occurs that could
change the display in a scrollbar, such as a change in the
total size of the widgets contents), the widget will
generate a Tcl command by concatenating the scroll command
and two numbers. Each of the numbers is a fraction between 0
and 1, which indicates a position in the document. 0
indicates the beginning of the document, 1 indicates the
end, .333 indicates a position one third the way through the
document, and so on. The first frac- tion indicates the
first information in the document that is visible in the
window, and the second fraction indicates the information
just after the last portion that is visible. The command is
then passed to the Tcl interpreter for execution. Typically
the xScrollCommand option consists of the path name of a
scrollbar widget followed by set , e.g. .x.scrollbar set:
this will cause the scrollbar to be updated whenever the
view in the window changes. If this option is not specified,
then no command will be executed.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-yscrollcommand Database Name:
yScrollCommand Database Class: ScrollCommand</p>

<p>Specifies the prefix for a command used to communicate
with ver- tical scrollbars. This option is treated in the
same way as the xScrollCommand option, except that it is
used for vertical scrollbars and is provided by widgets that
support vertical scrolling. See the description of
xScrollCommand for details on how this option is used.</p>
