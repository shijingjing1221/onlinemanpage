<p>NAME bounce - Postfix delivery status reports</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS bounce [generic Postfix daemon options]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The bounce(8) daemon maintains per-message
log files with delivery sta- tus information. Each log file
is named after the queue file that it corresponds to, and is
kept in a queue subdirectory named after the service name in
the master.cf file (either bounce, defer or trace). This
program expects to be run from the master(8) process
manager.</p>

<p>The bounce(8) daemon processes two types of service
requests:</p>

<p>&middot; Append a recipient (non-)delivery status record
to a per-message log file.</p>

<p>&middot; Enqueue a delivery status notification message,
with a copy of a per-message log file and of the
corresponding message. When the delivery status notification
message is enqueued successfully, the per-message log file
is deleted.</p>

<p>The software does a best notification effort. A
non-delivery notifica- tion is sent even when the log file
or the original message cannot be read.</p>

<p>Optionally, a bounce (defer, trace) client can request
that the per- message log file be deleted when the requested
operation fails. This is used by clients that cannot retry
transactions by themselves, and that depend on retry logic
in their own client.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS Problems and transactions are logged to
syslogd(8).</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS Changes to main.cf are picked
up automatically, as bounce(8) processes run for only a
limited amount of time. Use the command &quot;postfix
