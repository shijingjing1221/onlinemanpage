<p>AIO_SUSPEND(3) Linux Programmer s Manual
AIO_SUSPEND(3)</p>

<p>NAME aio_suspend - wait for asynchronous I/O operation
or timeout</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;aio.h&gt;</p>

<p>int aio_suspend(const struct aiocb * const cblist[], int
n, const struct timespec *timeout);</p>

<p>Link with -lrt.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The aio_suspend() function suspends the
calling process until at least one of the asynchronous I/O
requests in the list cblist of length n have completed, a
signal is delivered, or timeout is not NULL and the time
interval it indicates has passed.</p>

<p>Each item in the list must either be NULL (and then is
ignored), or a pointer to a control block on which I/O was
initiated using aio_read(3), aio_write(3), or
lio_listio(3).</p>

<p>If CLOCK_MONOTONIC is supported, this clock is used to
measure the timeout interval.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE If this function returns after completion
of one of the indicated requests, it returns 0. Otherwise it
returns -1 and sets errno appro- priately.</p>

<p>ERRORS EAGAIN The call was ended by timeout, before any
of the indicated oper- ations had completed.</p>

<p>EINTR The call was ended by signal; see signal(7).
(Possibly the com- pletion signal of one of the operations
we were waiting for.)</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>NOTES One can achieve polling by using a non-NULL
timeout that specifies a zero time interval.</p>

aio_read(3), aio_return(3), aio_write(3), time(7)</p>
