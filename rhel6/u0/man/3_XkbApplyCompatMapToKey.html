<p>XkbApplyCompatMapToKey(3) XKB FUNCTIONS
XkbApplyCompatMapToKey(3)</p>

<p>NAME XkbApplyCompatMapToKey - Apply the new
compatibility mapping to an individual key to get its
semantics updated</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS Bool XkbApplyCompatMapToKey (XkbDescPtr xkb,
KeyCode key, XkbChangesPtr changes);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS - xkb keyboard description to be updated</p>

<p>- key key to be updated</p>

<p>- changes notes changes to the Xkb keyboard
description</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION XkbApplyCompatMapToKey essentially performs
the operation described in Core Keyboard Mapping to Xkb
Keyboard Mapping Transformation to a spe- cific key. This
updates the behavior, actions, repeat status, and vir- tual
modifier bindings of the key.</p>

<p>Core Keyboard Mapping to Xkb Keyboard Mapping
Transformation</p>

<p>When a core protocol keyboard mapping request is
received by the server, the servers core keyboard map is
updated, and then the Xkb map maintained by the server is
updated. Because a client may have explic- itly configured
some of the Xkb keyboard mapping in the server, this
automatic regeneration of the Xkb keyboard mapping from the
core proto- col keyboard mapping should not modify any
components of the Xkb key- board mapping that were
explicitly set by a client. The client must set explicit
override controls to prevent this from happening (see
Explicit Components-Avoiding Automatic Remapping by the
Server). The core-to-Xkb mapping is done as follows:</p>

<p>Explicit Components-Avoiding Automatic Remapping by the
Server</p>

<p>Whenever a client remaps the keyboard using core
protocol requests, Xkb examines the map to determine likely
default values for the components that cannot be specified
using the core protocol.</p>

<p>This automatic remapping might replace definitions
explicitly requested by an application, so the Xkb keyboard
description defines an explicit components mask for each
key. Any aspects of the automatic remapping listed in the
explicit components mask for a key are not changed by the
automatic keyboard mapping.</p>

<p>The explicit components masks are held in the explicit
field of the server map, which is an array indexed by
keycode. Each entry in this array is a mask that is a
bitwise inclusive OR of the values shown in Table 1.</p>

<p>Table 1 Explicit Component Masks
---------------------------------------------------------------
Bit in Explicit Mask Value Protects Against
---------------------------------------------------------------
ExplicitKeyType1 (1&lt;&lt;0) Automatic determination of the
key type associated with Group1.</p>

<p>ExplicitKeyType2 (1&lt;&lt;1) Automatic determination of
the key type associated with Group2. ExplicitKeyType3
(1&lt;&lt;2) Automatic determination of the key type
associated with Group3. ExplicitKeyType4 (1&lt;&lt;3)
Automatic determination of the key type associated with
Group4. ExplicitInterpret (1&lt;&lt;4) Application of any of
the fields of a symbol interpreta- tion to the key in
question. ExplicitAutoRepeat (1&lt;&lt;5) Automatic
determination of auto-repeat status for the key, as
specified in a symbol interpretation. ExplicitBehavior
(1&lt;&lt;6) Automatic assignment of the XkbKB_Lock behavior
to the key, if the XkbSI_LockingKey flag is set in a symbol
inter- pretation. ExplicitVModMap (1&lt;&lt;7) Automatic
determination of the virtual modifier map for the key based
on the actions assigned to the key and the symbol
interpretations that match the key.</p>

<p>1. Map the symbols from the keys in the core keyboard
map to groups and symbols on keys in the Xkb keyboard map.
The core keyboard map- ping is of fixed width, so each key
in the core mapping has the same number of symbols
associated with it. The Xkb mapping allows a different
number of symbols to be associated with each key; those
symbols may be divided into a different number of groups
(1-4) for each key. For each key, this process therefore
involves partition- ing the fixed number of symbols from the
core mapping into a set of variable-length groups with a
variable number of symbols in each group. For example, if
the core protocol map is of width five, the partition for
one key might result in one group with two symbols and
another with three symbols. A different key might result in
two groups with two symbols plus a third group with one
symbol. The core protocol map requires at least two symbols
in each of the first two groups.</p>

<p>1a. For each changed key, determine the number of groups
represented in the new core keyboard map. This results in a
tentative group count for each key in the Xkb map.</p>

<p>1b. For each changed key, determine the number of
symbols in each of the groups found in step 1a. There is one
explicit override control associated with each of the four
possible groups for each Xkb key, ExplicitKeyType1 through
ExplicitKeyType4. If no explicit override control is set for
a group, the number of symbols used for that group from the
core map is two. If the explicit override control is set for
a group on the key, the number of symbols used for that Xkb
group from the core map is the width of the Xkb group with
one exception: because of the core protocol requirement for
at least two symbols in each of groups one and two, the
number of symbols used for groups one and two is the maximum
of 2 or the width of the Xkb group.</p>

<p>1c. For each changed key, assign the symbols in the core
map to the appropriate group on the key. If the total number
of symbols required by the Xkb map for a particular key
needs more symbols than the core protocol map contains, the
additional symbols are taken to be NoSymbol keysyms appended
to the end of the core set. If the core map contains more
symbols than are needed by the Xkb map, trailing symbols in
the core map are discarded. In the absence of an explicit
override for group one or two, symbols are assigned in order
by group; the first symbols in the core map are assigned to
group one, in order, followed by group two, and so on. For
exam- ple, if the core map contained eight symbols per key,
and a partic- ular Xkb map contained 2 symbols for G1 and G2
and three for G3, the symbols would be assigned as (G is
group, L is shift level):</p>

<p>G1L1 G1L2 G2L1 G2L2 G3L1 G3L2 G3L3</p>

<p>If an explicit override control is set for group one or
two, the symbols are taken from the core set in a somewhat
different order. The first four symbols from the core set
are assigned to G1L1, G1L2, G2L1, G2L2, respectively. If
group one requires more symbols, they are taken next, and
then any additional symbols needed by group two. Group three
and four symbols are taken in complete sequence after group
two. For example, a key with four groups and three symbols
in each group would take symbols from the core set in the
following order:</p>

<p>G1L1 G1L2 G2L1 G2L2 G1L3 G2L3 G3L1 G3L2 G3L3 G4L1 G4L2
G4L3</p>

<p>As previously noted, the core protocol map requires at
lease two symbols in groups one and two. Because of this, if
an explicit override control for an Xkb key is set and group
one and / or group two is of width one, it is not possible
to generate the symbols taken from the core protocol set and
assigned to position G1L2 and / or G2L2.</p>

<p>1d. For each group on each changed key, assign a key
type appropriate for the symbols in the group.</p>

<p>1e. For each changed key, remove any empty or redundant
groups.</p>

<p>At this point, the groups and their associated symbols
have been assigned to the corresponding key definitions in
the Xkb map.</p>

<p>2. Apply symbol interpretations to modify key operation.
This phase is completely skipped if the ExplicitInterpret
override control bit is set in the explicit controls mask
for the Xkb key (see Explicit Components-Avoiding Automatic
Remapping by the Server).</p>

<p>2a. For each symbol on each changed key, attempt to
match the symbol and modifiers from the Xkb map to a symbol
interpretation describ- ing how to generate the symbol.</p>

<p>2b. When a match is found in step 2a, apply the symbol
interpretation to change the semantics associated with the
symbol in the Xkb key map. If no match is found, apply a
default interpretation.</p>

<p>The symbol interpretations used in step 2 are
configurable and may be specified using XkbSymInterpretRec
structures referenced by the sym_interpret field of an
XkbCompatMapRec.</p>

<p>Symbol Interpretations - the XkbSymInterpretRec
Structure</p>

<p>Symbol interpretations are used to guide the X server
when it modifies the Xkb keymap in step 2. An initial set of
symbol interpretations is loaded by the server when it
starts. A client may add new ones using XkbSetCompatMap.</p>

<p>Symbol interpretations result in key semantics being
set. When a symbol interpretation is applied, the following
components of server key event processing may be modified
for the particular key involved:</p>

<p>Virtual modifier map Auto repeat Key behavior (may be
set to XkbKB_Lock) Key action</p>

<p>The XkbSymInterpretRec structure specifies a symbol
interpretation:</p>

<p>typedef struct { KeySym sym; / keysym of interest or
NULL */ unsigned char flags; / XkbSI_AutoRepeat,
XkbSI_LockingKey */ unsigned char match; / specifies how
mods is interpreted */ unsigned char mods; / modifier bits,
correspond to eight real modifiers */ unsigned char
virtual_mod; / 1 modifier to add to key virtual mod map */
XkbAnyAction act; / action to bind to symbol position on key
*/ } XkbSymInterpretRec,*XkbSymInterpretPtr;</p>

<p>If sym is not NULL, it limits the symbol interpretation
to keys on which that particular keysym is selected by the
modifiers matching the criteria specified by mods and match.
If sym is NULL, the interpreta- tion may be applied to any
symbol selected on a key when the modifiers match the
criteria specified by mods and match.</p>

<p>match must be one of the values shown in Table 2 and
specifies how the real modifiers specified in mods are to be
interpreted.</p>

<p>Table 2 Symbol Interpretation Match Criteria
-----------------------------------------------------------
Match Criteria Value Effect
-----------------------------------------------------------
XkbSI_NoneOf (0) None of the bits that are on in mods can be
set, but other bits can be. XkbSI_AnyOfOrNone (1) Zero or
more of the bits that are on in mods can be set, as well as
others. XkbSI_AnyOf (2) One or more of the bits that are on
in mods can be set, as well as any others. XkbSI_AllOf (3)
All of the bits that are on in mods must be set, but others
may be set as well. XkbSI_Exactly (4) All of the bits that
are on in mods must be set, and no other bits may be
set.</p>

<p>In addition to the above bits, match may contain the
XkbSI_LevelOneOnly bit, in which case the modifier match
criteria specified by mods and match applies only if sym is
in level one of its group; otherwise, mods and match are
ignored and the symbol matches a condition where no modi-
fiers are set.</p>

<p>#define XkbSI_LevelOneOnly (0x80) / use mods + match
only if sym is level 1 */</p>

<p>If no matching symbol interpretation is found, the
server uses a default interpretation where:</p>

<p>sym = 0 flags = XkbSI_AutoRepeat match =
XkbSI_AnyOfOrNone mods = 0 virtual_mod = XkbNoModifier act =
SA_NoAction</p>

<p>When a matching symbol interpretation is found in step
2a, the inter- pretation is applied to modify the Xkb map as
follows.</p>

<p>The act field specifies a single action to be bound to
the symbol posi- tion; any key event that selects the symbol
causes the action to be taken. Valid actions are defined in
Key Actions.</p>

<p>If the Xkb keyboard map for the key does not have its
ExplicitVModMap control set, the XkbSI_LevelOneOnly bit and
symbol position are exam- ined. If the XkbSI_LevelOneOnly
bit is not set in match or the symbol is in position G1L1,
the virtual_mod field is examined. If virtual_mod is not
XkbNoModifier, virtual_mod specifies a single virtual
modifier to be added to the virtual modifier map for the
key. virtual_mod is specified as an index in the range
[0..15].</p>

<p>If the matching symbol is in position G1L1 of the key,
two bits in the flags field potentially specify additional
behavior modifications:</p>

<p>#define XkbSI_AutoRepeat (1&lt;&lt;0) / key repeats if
sym is in position G1L1 */ #define XkbSI_LockingKey
(1&lt;&lt;1) / set KB_Lock behavior if sym is in psn G1L1
*/</p>

<p>If the Xkb keyboard map for the key does not have its
ExplicitAutoRe- peat control set, its auto repeat behavior
is set based on the value of the XkbSI_AutoRepeat bit. If
the XkbSI_AutoRepeat bit is set, the auto- repeat behavior
of the key is turned on; otherwise, it is turned off.</p>

<p>If the Xkb keyboard map for the key does not have its
ExplicitBehavior control set, its locking behavior is set
based on the value of the XkbSI_LockingKey bit. If
XkbSI_LockingKey is set, the key behavior is set to KB_Lock;
otherwise, it is turned off.</p>
