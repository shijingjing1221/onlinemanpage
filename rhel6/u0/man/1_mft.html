<p>NAME mft - translate Metafont code to TeX code for
prettyprinting</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS mft mf_file_name[.mf] [ [ -c ] or [
change_file_name[.ch] ] ] [ [ -s ] or [
style_file_name[.mft] ] ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page is not meant to be
exhaustive. The complete documen- tation for this version of
TeX can be found in the info file or manual Web2C: A TeX
implementation.</p>

<p>The mft program creates a TeX file from a Metafont
program. It takes appropriate care of typographic details
like page layout and the use of indentation, italics,
boldface, etc., as illustrated in the book Com- puter Modern
Typefaces. Special conventions in Metafont comments allow
you to control things that would not otherwise come out
right; section 1 of the MFT source program in the
Metafontware report explains these rules.</p>

<p>The command line has one required file name and two
optional file names. The required one is a Metafont source
file; there is also an optional change file (which works
just as the change files to tangle(1) and weave(1) do) and
an optional style file (which is prepended to
everything).</p>

<p>A file name that doesnt contain a dot is always given an
extension, either .mf (Metafont) or .ch (change) or .mft
(style). If no style file is specified, the style file
plain.mft is automatically used. The change_file_name is not
searched for using any paths. The .mf file is searched for
using the MFINPUTS environment variable if you have set it,
or else the system default. The style file is searched for
using the TEXINPUTS environment variable. See tex(1) for the
details of the searching.</p>

<p>The output TeX file name is formed by using .tex in
place of the exten- sion of mf_file_name.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Specify command-line options -c to suppress the
reading of a change file, and -s to suppress the reading of
a style file.</p>

<p>FILES mftmac.tex TeX macros used by mft output.</p>

<p>plain.mft Default style file.</p>

<p>cmbase.mft Style file for Computer Modern.</p>

<p>AUTHORS Donald E. Knuth wrote the program, and he ported
it to Unix with the help of Pierre MacKay and the Unix port
of weave by Howard Trickey and Pavel Curtis. The program is
published in the Metafontware technical report, available
from the TeX Users Group.</p>
