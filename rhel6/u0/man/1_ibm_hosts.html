<p>NAME ibm_hosts - host database for x3270 and c3270</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS /usr/lib/X11/x3270/ibm_hosts</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The ibm_hosts file contains information
regarding IBM hosts on the net- work. An IBM host is a host
which can communicate with a 3270 terminal emulator such as
x3270 or c3270. Each line defines a name in the fol- lowing
(optional fields are shown in brackets):</p>

<p>name type [opt:]...[luname@]hostname[:port]
[actions]</p>

<p>Items are separated by any number of blanks and/or TAB
characters. A line beginning with # is taken as a comment
(note that # anywhere else on a line does not indicate a
comment).</p>

<p>The name field is a mnemonic used to identify the
host.</p>

<p>The type field is a keyword that indicates the type of
entry. The value primary means that the name will be
included in host-selection menus that may be displayed by a
3270 emulator. The value alias means that the name will not
be included in menus, but will still be accepted as valid
input when a host name is required.</p>

<p>The hostname field is the Internet hostname or
dot-notation Internet address of the host.</p>

<p>The hostname can include s: or p: prefixes, e.g.,
s:finicky (see the x3270(1) or c3270(1) man page sfor
details). It can also include an LU name, separated by an @
character, e.g., oddlu@bluehost. Finally, it can include a
non-default port number, appended to the hostname with a
colon : character, e.g., bluehost:97. (For compata- bility
with earlier versions of x3270, the port can also be
separated by a slash / character.)</p>

<p>The optional actions field specifies actions to be taken
once the con- nection is made and a data-entry field is
defined. If the text looks like an action, e.g., PF(1), it
is unmodified; otherwise it is taken as the parameter to the
String() action. The actions are not intended for entering
usernames and passwords; rather they provide an automated
way of specifying a front-end menu option.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE Given the following ibm_hosts file:</p>

<p>mvs primary mvs-host tso alias mvs-host mvs2 primary
mvs-host:4012 vm primary vtam Tab() String(3) Enter()</p>

<p>A 3270 emulator will display four names (mvs, mvs2,
afhost and vm) on its hosts menu. The names mvs and tso will
cause connections to the host mvs-host. The name mvs2 will
also cause a connection to mvs-host, but to port 4012 rather
than the emulators default port (usually 23). The name vm
will cause the 3270 emulator to connect to the host vtam
(presumably some sort of host-selection front-end), enter
the string 3 on the second data-entry field on the screen,
and send the Enter AID sequence.</p>
