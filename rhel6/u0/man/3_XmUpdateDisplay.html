call)</p>

<p>NAME XmUpdateDisplay A function that processes all
pending exposure events immediately</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS void XmUpdateDisplay (widget) Widget widget;
(void)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION XmUpdateDisplay provides the application
with a mechanism for forcing all pending exposure events to
be removed from the input queue and pro- cessed immediately.
When a user selects a button within a menu pane, the menu
panes are unposted and then any activation callbacks regis-
tered by the application are invoked. If one of the
callbacks performs a time-consuming action, the portion of
the application window that was covered by the menu panes
will not have been redrawn; normal exposure processing does
not occur until all of the callbacks have been invoked. If
the application writer suspects that a callback will take a
long time, then the callback may choose to invoke
XmUpdateDisplay before starting its time-consuming
operation. This function is also useful any time a transient
window, such as a dialog box, is unposted; call- backs are
invoked before normal exposure processing can occur.</p>

<p>widget Specifies any widget or gadget.</p>
