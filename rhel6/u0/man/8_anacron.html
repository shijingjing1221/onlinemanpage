<p>ANACRON(8) Anacron Users Manual ANACRON(8)</p>

<p>NAME anacron - runs commands periodically</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS anacron [-s] [-f] [-n] [-d] [-q] [-t
anacrontab] [-S spooldir] [job] anacron [-S spooldir] -u [-t
anacrontab] [job] anacron [-V|-h] anacron -T [-t
anacrontab]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Anacron is used to execute commands
periodically, with a frequency specified in days. Unlike
cron(8), it does not assume that the machine is running
continuously. Hence, it can be used on machines that arent
running 24 hours a day, to control regular jobs as daily,
weekly, and monthly jobs.</p>

<p>Anacron reads a list of jobs from a configuration file,
/etc/anacrontab (see anacrontab(5)). This file contains the
list of jobs that Anacron controls. Each job entry specifies
a period in days, a delay in min- utes, a unique job
identifier, and a shell command.</p>

<p>For each job, Anacron checks whether this job has been
executed in the last n days, where n is the period specified
for that job. If not, Anacron runs the jobs shell command,
after waiting for the number of minutes specified as the
delay parameter.</p>

<p>After the command exits, Anacron records the date in a
special times- tamp file for that job, so it can know when
to execute it again. Only the date is used for the time
calculations. The hour is not used.</p>

<p>When there are no more jobs to be run, Anacron
exits.</p>

<p>Anacron only considers jobs whose identifier, as
specified in the anacrontab matches any of the job
command-line arguments. The job arguments can be shell
wildcard patterns (be sure to protect them from your shell
with adequate quoting). Specifying no job arguments, is
equivalent to specifying &quot;*&quot; (That is, all jobs
will be considered).</p>

<p>Unless the -d option is given (see below), Anacron forks
to the back- ground when it starts, and the parent process
exits immediately.</p>

<p>Unless the -s or -n options are given, Anacron starts
jobs immediately when their delay is over. The execution of
different jobs is com- pletely independent.</p>

<p>If a job generates any output on its standard output or
standard error, the output is mailed to the user running
Anacron (usually root), or to the address contained by the
MAILTO environment variable in the crontab, if such exists.
If the LOGNAME environment variable is set, it will be used
as From: field.</p>

<p>Informative messages about what Anacron is doing are
sent to syslogd(8) or rsyslogd(8) under facility cron,
priority notice. Error messages are sent at priority
error.</p>

<p>&quot;Active&quot; jobs (i.e. jobs that Anacron already
decided to run and now wait for their delay to pass, and
jobs that are currently being exe- cuted by Anacron), are
&quot;locked&quot;, so that other copies of Anacron wont run
them at the same time.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -f Force execution of the jobs, ignoring the
timestamps.</p>

<p>-u Only update the timestamps of the jobs, to the
current date, but dont run anything.</p>

<p>-s Serialize execution of jobs. Anacron will not start a
new job before the previous one finished.</p>

<p>-n Run jobs now. Ignore the delay specifications in the
/etc/anacrontab file. This options implies -s.</p>

<p>-d Dont fork to the background. In this mode, Anacron
will output informational messages to standard error, as
well as to syslog. The output of jobs is mailed as
usual.</p>

<p>-q Suppress messages to standard error. Only applicable
with -d.</p>

<p>-t some_anacrontab Use specified anacrontab, rather than
the default</p>

<p>-T Anacrontab testing. The configuration file will be
tested for validity. If there is an error in the file, an
error will be shown and anacron will return 1. Valid
anacrontabs will return 0.</p>

<p>-S spooldir Use the specified spooldir to store
timestamps in. This option is required for users who wish to
run anacron themselves.</p>

<p>-V Print version information, and exit.</p>

<p>-h Print short usage message, and exit.</p>

<p>SIGNALS After receiving a SIGUSR1 signal, Anacron waits
for running jobs, if any, to finish and then exits. This can
be used to stop Anacron cleanly.</p>

<p>NOTES Make sure that the time-zone is set correctly
before Anacron is started. (The time-zone affects the date).
This is usually accom- plished by setting the TZ environment
variable, or by installing a /usr/lib/zoneinfo/localtime
file. See tzset(3) for more information.</p>

<p>Timestamp files are created in the spool directory for
each job in anacrontab. These are never removed
automatically by anacron, and should be removed by hand if a
job is no longer being scheduled.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/anacrontab Contains specifications of jobs.
See anacrontab(5) for a com- plete description.</p>

<p>/var/spool/anacron This directory is used by Anacron for
storing timestamp files.</p>

<p>The Anacron README file.</p>

<p>BUGS Anacron never removes timestamp files. Remove
unused files manually.</p>

<p>Anacron uses up to two file descriptors for each active
job. It may run out of descriptors if there are more than
about 125 active jobs (on normal kernels).</p>
