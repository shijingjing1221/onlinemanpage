<p>NAME makestrs - makes string table C source and
header(s)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS makestrs [-f source] [-i includedir]
[-abioptions ...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The makestrs command creates string table C
source files and headers. If -f source is not specified
makestrs will read from stdin. The C source file is always
written to stdout. makestrs creates one or more C header
files as specified in the source file. The following options
may be specified: -sparcabi, -intelabi, -functionabi,
-arrayperabi, and -defaultabi.</p>

<p>-sparcabi is used on SPARC platforms conforming to the
SPARC Compliance Definition, i.e. SVR4/Solaris.</p>

<p>-intelabi is used on Intel platforms conforming to the
System V Appli- cation Binary Interface, i.e. SVR4.</p>

<p>-earlyR6abi may be used in addition to -intelabi for
situations where the vendor wishes to maintain binary
compatibility between X11R6 pub- lic-patch 11 (and earlier)
and X11R6 public-patch 12 (and later).</p>

<p>-functionabi generates a functional abi to the string
table. This mech- anism imposes a severe performance penalty
and its recommended that you not use it.</p>

<p>-arrayperabi results in a separate array for each
string. This is the default behavior if makestrs was
compiled with -DARRAYPERSTR (it almost never is).</p>

<p>-defaultabi forces the generation of the
&quot;normal&quot; string table even if makestrs was
compiled with -DARRAYPERSTR. Since makestrs is almost never
compiled with -DARRAYPERSTR this is the default behavior if
no abioptions are specified.</p>

<p>-i includedir forces the reading of templates from the
includedir instead of the local directory. This is useful to
have separate source and build directories.</p>

<p>SYNTAX The syntax for string-list file is (items in
square brackets are optional): #prefix &lt;text&gt; #feature
&lt;text&gt; #externref &lt;text&gt; #externdef
[&lt;text&gt;] [#ctempl &lt;text&gt;]</p>

<p>#file &lt;filename&gt; #table &lt;tablename&gt;
[#htempl] &lt;text&gt; ... &lt;text&gt; [#table
&lt;tablename&gt; &lt;text&gt; ... &lt;text&gt; ... #table
&lt;tablename&gt; ...] [#file &lt;filename&gt; ...]</p>

<p>In words you may have one or more #file directives. Each
#file may have one or more #table directives.</p>

<p>The #prefix directive determines the string that makestr
will prefix to each definition.</p>

<p>The #feature directive determines the string that
makestr will use for the feature-test macro, e.g.
X[TM]STRINGDEFINES.</p>

<p>The #externref directive determines the string that
makestr will use for the extern clause, typically this will
be &quot;extern&quot; but Motif wants it to be
&quot;externalref&quot;</p>

<p>The #externdef directive determines the string that
makestr will use for the declaration, typically this will be
the null string (note that makestrs requires a trailing
space in this case, i.e. &quot;#externdef &quot;), and Motif
will use &quot;externaldef(_xmstrings).</p>

<p>The #ctmpl directive determines the name of the file
used as a template for the C source file that is
generated</p>

<p>Each #file &lt;filename&gt; directive will result in a
corresponding header file by that name containing the
appropriate definitions as specified by command line
options. A single C source file containing the declara-
tions for the definitions in all the headers will be printed
to stdout.</p>

<p>The #htmpl directive determines the name of the file
used as a template for the C header file that is
generated.</p>

<p>Each #table &lt;tablename&gt; directive will be
processed in accordance with the ABI. On most platforms all
tables will be catenated into a single table with the name
of the first table for that file. To conform to the Intel
ABI separate tables will be generated with the names
indicated.</p>

<p>The template files specified by the #ctmpl and #htmpl
directives are processed by copying line for line from the
template file to the appro- priate output file. The line
containing the string &lt;&lt;&lt;STRING_TA-
BLE_GOES_HERE&gt;&gt;&gt; is not copied to the output file.
The appropriate data is then copied to the output file and
then the remainder of the tem- plate file is copied to the
output file.</p>

<p>BUGS makestrs is not very forgiving of syntax errors.
Sometimes you need a trailing space after # directives,
other times they will mess you up. No warning messages are
emitted.</p>
