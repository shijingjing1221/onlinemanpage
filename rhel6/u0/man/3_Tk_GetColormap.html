<p>Tk_GetColormap(3) Tk Library Procedures
Tk_GetColormap(3)</p>


<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME Tk_GetColormap, Tk_PreserveColormap,
Tk_FreeColormap - allocate and free colormaps</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tk.h&gt;</p>

<p>Colormap Tk_GetColormap(interp, tkwin, string)</p>

<p>Tk_PreserveColormap(display, colormap)</p>

<p>Tk_FreeColormap(display, colormap)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS Tcl_Interp *interp (in) Interpreter to use for
error reporting.</p>

<p>Tk_Window tkwin (in) Token for window in which colormap
will be used.</p>

<p>const char *string (in) Selects a colormap: either new
or the name of a window with the same screen and visual as
tkwin.</p>

<p>Display *display (in) Display for which colormap was
allo- cated.</p>

<p>Colormap colormap (in) Colormap to free or preserve;
must have been returned by a previous call to Tk_GetColormap
or Tk_GetVisual.

<p>DESCRIPTION These procedures are used to manage
colormaps. Tk_GetColormap returns a colormap suitable for
use in tkwin. If its string argument is new then a new
colormap is created; otherwise string must be the name of
another window with the same screen and visual as tkwin, and
the col- ormap from that window is returned. If string does
not make sense, or if it refers to a window on a different
screen from tkwin or with a different visual than tkwin,
then Tk_GetColormap returns None and leaves an error message
in interps result.</p>

<p>Tk_PreserveColormap increases the internal reference
count for a col- ormap previously returned by
Tk_GetColormap, which allows the colormap to be stored in
several locations without knowing which order they will be
released.</p>

<p>Tk_FreeColormap should be called when a colormap
returned by Tk_GetCol- ormap is no longer needed. Tk
maintains a reference count for each colormap returned by
Tk_GetColormap, so there should eventually be one call to
Tk_FreeColormap for each call to Tk_GetColormap and each
call to Tk_PreserveColormap. When a colormap s reference
count becomes zero, Tk releases the X colormap.</p>

<p>Tk_GetVisual and Tk_GetColormap work together, in that a
new colormap created by Tk_GetVisual may later be returned
by Tk_GetColormap. The reference counting mechanism for
colormaps includes both procedures, so callers of
Tk_GetVisual must also call Tk_FreeColormap to release the
colormap. If Tk_GetColormap is called with a string value of
new then the resulting colormap will never be returned by
Tk_GetVisual; however, it can be used in other windows by
calling Tk_GetColormap with the original windows name as
string.</p>
