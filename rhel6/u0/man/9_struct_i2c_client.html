<p>STRUCT I2C_CLIENT(9) I2C and SMBus Subsystem STRUCT
I2C_CLIENT(9)</p>

<p>NAME struct_i2c_client - represent an I2C slave
device</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS struct i2c_client { unsigned short flags;
unsigned short addr; char name[I2C_NAME_SIZE]; struct
i2c_adapter * adapter; struct i2c_driver * driver; struct
device dev; int irq; struct list_head detected; };</p>

<p>MEMBERS flags I2C_CLIENT_TEN indicates the device uses a
ten bit chip address; I2C_CLIENT_PEC indicates it uses SMBus
Packet Error Checking</p>

<p>addr Address used on the I2C bus connected to the parent
adapter.</p>

<p>name[I2C_NAME_SIZE] Indicates the type of the device,
usually a chip name that&acute;s generic enough to hide
second-sourcing and compatible revisions.</p>

<p>adapter manages the bus segment hosting this I2C
device</p>

<p>driver device&acute;s driver, hence pointer to access
routines</p>

<p>dev Driver model device node for the slave.</p>

<p>irq indicates the IRQ generated by this device (if
any)</p>

<p>detected member of an i2c_driver.clients list or
i2c-core&acute;s userspace_devices list</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION An i2c_client identifies a single device
(i.e. chip) connected to an i2c bus. The behaviour exposed
to Linux is defined by the driver managing the device.</p>
