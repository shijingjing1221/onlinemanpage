<p>ENUM IEEE80211_HW_FL(9) The basic mac80211 driver inte
ENUM IEEE80211_HW_FL(9)</p>

<p>NAME enum_ieee80211_hw_flags - hardware flags</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS enum ieee80211_hw_flags {
IEEE80211_HW_RX_INCLUDES_FCS,
IEEE80211_HW_HOST_BROADCAST_PS_BUFFERING,
IEEE80211_HW_2GHZ_SHORT_SLOT_INCAPABLE,
IEEE80211_HW_2GHZ_SHORT_PREAMBLE_INCAPABLE,
IEEE80211_HW_SIGNAL_UNSPEC, IEEE80211_HW_SIGNAL_DBM,
IEEE80211_HW_NOISE_DBM, IEEE80211_HW_SPECTRUM_MGMT,
IEEE80211_HW_AMPDU_AGGREGATION, IEEE80211_HW_SUPPORTS_PS,
IEEE80211_HW_PS_NULLFUNC_STACK,
IEEE80211_HW_SUPPORTS_DYNAMIC_PS, IEEE80211_HW_MFP_CAPABLE,
IEEE80211_HW_BEACON_FILTER,
IEEE80211_HW_REPORTS_TX_ACK_STATUS };</p>

<p>CONSTANTS IEEE80211_HW_RX_INCLUDES_FCS Indicates that
received frames passed to the stack include the FCS at the
end.</p>

<p>IEEE80211_HW_HOST_BROADCAST_PS_BUFFERING Some wireless
LAN chipsets buffer broadcast/multicast frames for power
saving stations in the hardware/firmware and others rely on
the host system for such buffering. This option is used to
configure the IEEE 802.11 upper layer to buffer broadcast
and multicast frames when there are power saving stations so
that the driver can fetch them with
ieee80211_get_buffered_bc.</p>

<p>IEEE80211_HW_2GHZ_SHORT_SLOT_INCAPABLE Hardware is not
capable of short slot operation on the 2.4 GHz band.</p>

<p>IEEE80211_HW_2GHZ_SHORT_PREAMBLE_INCAPABLE Hardware is
not capable of receiving frames with short preamble on the
2.4 GHz band.</p>

<p>IEEE80211_HW_SIGNAL_UNSPEC Hardware can provide signal
values but we don&acute;t know its units. We expect values
between 0 and max_signal. If possible please provide dB or
dBm instead.</p>

<p>IEEE80211_HW_SIGNAL_DBM Hardware gives signal values in
dBm, decibel difference from one milliwatt. This is the
preferred method since it is standardized between different
devices. max_signal does not need to be set.</p>

<p>IEEE80211_HW_NOISE_DBM Hardware can provide noise (radio
interference) values in units dBm, decibel difference from
one milliwatt.</p>

<p>IEEE80211_HW_SPECTRUM_MGMT Hardware supports spectrum
management defined in 802.11h Measurement, Channel Switch,
Quieting, TPC</p>

<p>IEEE80211_HW_AMPDU_AGGREGATION Hardware supports 11n
A-MPDU aggregation.</p>

<p>IEEE80211_HW_SUPPORTS_PS Hardware has power save support
(i.e. can go to sleep).</p>

<p>IEEE80211_HW_PS_NULLFUNC_STACK Hardware requires
nullfunc frame handling in stack, implies stack support for
dynamic PS.</p>

<p>IEEE80211_HW_SUPPORTS_DYNAMIC_PS Hardware has support
for dynamic PS.</p>

<p>IEEE80211_HW_MFP_CAPABLE Hardware supports management
frame protection (MFP, IEEE 802.11w).</p>

<p>IEEE80211_HW_BEACON_FILTER Hardware supports dropping of
irrelevant beacon frames to avoid waking up cpu.</p>

<p>IEEE80211_HW_REPORTS_TX_ACK_STATUS Hardware can provide
ack status reports of Tx frames to the stack.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION These flags are used to indicate hardware
capabilities to the stack. Generally, flags here should have
their meaning done in a way that the simplest hardware
doesn&acute;t need setting any particular flags. There are
some exceptions to this rule, however, so you are advised to
review these flags carefully.</p>
