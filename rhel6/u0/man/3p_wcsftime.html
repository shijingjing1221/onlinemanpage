<p>WCSFTIME(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual WCSFTIME(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME wcsftime - convert date and time to a
wide-character string</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;wchar.h&gt;</p>

<p>size_t wcsftime(wchar_t *restrict wcs, size_t maxsize,
const wchar_t *restrict format, const struct tm *restrict
timeptr);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The wcsftime() function shall be equivalent
to the strftime() function, except that:</p>

<p>* The argument wcs points to the initial element of an
array of wide characters into which the generated output is
to be placed.</p>

<p>* The argument maxsize indicates the maximum number of
wide characters to be placed in the output array.</p>

<p>* The argument format is a wide-character string and the
conversion specifications are replaced by corresponding
sequences of wide char- acters.</p>

<p>* The return value indicates the number of wide
characters placed in the output array.</p>

<p>If copying takes place between objects that overlap, the
behavior is undefined.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE If the total number of resulting
wide-character codes including the terminating null
wide-character code is no more than maxsize, wcsf- time()
shall return the number of wide-character codes placed into
the array pointed to by wcs, not including the terminating
null wide-char- acter code. Otherwise, zero is returned and
the contents of the array are unspecified.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
