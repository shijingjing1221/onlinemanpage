<p>ACL_GET_FD(3) BSD Library Functions Manual
ACL_GET_FD(3)</p>

<p>NAME acl_get_fd - get an ACL by file descriptor</p>

<p>LIBRARY Linux Access Control Lists library (libacl,
-lacl).</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; #include
&lt;sys/acl.h&gt;</p>

<p>acl_t acl_get_fd(int fd);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The acl_get_fd() function retrieves the
access ACL associated with the file referred to by fd. The
ACL is placed into working storage and acl_get_fd() returns
a pointer to that storage.</p>

<p>In order to read an ACL from an object, a process must
have read access to the objects attributes.</p>

<p>This function may cause memory to be allocated. The
caller should free any releasable memory, when the new ACL
is no longer required, by calling acl_free(3) with the
(void*)acl_t returned by acl_get_fd() as an argu- ment.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, this function shall return a
pointer to the working storage. On error, a value of
(acl_t)NULL shall be returned, and errno is set
appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS If any of the following conditions occur, the
acl_get_fd() function returns a value of (acl_t)NULL and
sets errno to the corresponding value:</p>

<p>[EBADF] The fd argument is not a valid file
descriptor.</p>

<p>[ENOMEM] The ACL working storage requires more memory
than is allowed by the hardware or system-imposed memory
man- agement constraints.</p>

<p>[ENOTSUP] The file system on which the file identified
by fd is located does not support ACLs, or ACLs are
disabled.</p>

<p>STANDARDS IEEE Std 1003.1e draft 17 (POSIX.1e,
abandoned)</p>
