<p>POSTLOCK(1) POSTLOCK(1)</p>

<p>NAME postlock - lock mail folder and execute command</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS postlock [-c config_dir] [-l lock_style] [-v]
file command...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The postlock(1) command locks file for
exclusive access, and executes command. The locking method
is compatible with the Postfix UNIX-style local delivery
agent.</p>

<p>Options:</p>

<p>-c config_dir Read the main.cf configuration file in the
named directory instead of the default configuration
directory.</p>

<p>-l lock_style Override the locking method specified via
the mailbox_deliv- ery_lock configuration parameter (see
below).</p>

<p>-v Enable verbose logging for debugging purposes.
Multiple -v options make the software increasingly
verbose.</p>

<p>Arguments:</p>

<p>file A mailbox file. The user should have read/write
permission.</p>

<p>command... The command to execute while file is locked
for exclusive access. The command is executed directly, i.e.
without inter- pretation by a shell command interpreter.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS The result status is 75 (EX_TEMPFAIL) when
postlock(1) could not per- form the requested operation.
Otherwise, the exit status is the exit status from the
command.</p>

<p>BUGS With remote file systems, the ability to acquire a
lock does not neces- sarily eliminate access conflicts.
Avoid file access by processes run- ning on different
machines.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT MAIL_CONFIG Directory with Postfix
configuration files.</p>

<p>MAIL_VERBOSE Enable verbose logging for debugging
purposes.</p>
