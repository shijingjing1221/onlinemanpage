<p>DRAND48(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual DRAND48(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME drand48, erand48, jrand48, lcong48, lrand48,
mrand48, nrand48, seed48, srand48 - generate uniformly
distributed pseudo-random numbers</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</p>

<p>double drand48(void); double erand48(unsigned short
xsubi[3]); long jrand48(unsigned short xsubi[3]); void
lcong48(unsigned short param[7]); long lrand48(void); long
mrand48(void); long nrand48(unsigned short xsubi[3]);
unsigned short *seed48(unsigned short seed16v[3]); void
srand48(long seedval);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This family of functions shall generate
pseudo-random numbers using a linear congruential algorithm
and 48-bit integer arithmetic.</p>

<p>The drand48() and erand48() functions shall return
non-negative, dou- ble-precision, floating-point values,
uniformly distributed over the interval [0.0,1.0).</p>

<p>The lrand48() and nrand48() functions shall return
non-negative, long integers, uniformly distributed over the
interval [0,2**31).</p>

<p>The mrand48() and jrand48() functions shall return
signed long integers uniformly distributed over the interval
[-2**31,2**31).</p>

<p>The srand48(), seed48(), and lcong48() functions are
initialization entry points, one of which should be invoked
before either drand48(), lrand48(), or mrand48() is called.
(Although it is not recommended practice, constant default
initializer values shall be supplied auto- matically if
drand48(), lrand48(), or mrand48() is called without a prior
call to an initialization entry point.) The erand48(),
nrand48(), and jrand48() functions do not require an
initialization entry point to be called first.</p>

<p>All the routines work by generating a sequence of 48-bit
integer val- ues, X_i, according to the linear congruential
formula: X_n+1 = (aX_n + c)_mod m n&gt;= 0</p>

<p>The parameter m = 2**48; hence 48-bit integer arithmetic
is performed. Unless lcong48() is invoked, the multiplier
value a and the addend value c are given by: a =
5DEECE66D_16 = 273673163155_8</p>

<p>c = B_16 = 13_8</p>

<p>The value returned by any of the drand48(), erand48(),
jrand48(), lrand48(), mrand48(), or nrand48() functions is
computed by first gen- erating the next 48-bit X_i in the
sequence. Then the appropriate num- ber of bits, according
to the type of data item to be returned, are copied from the
high-order (leftmost) bits of X_i and transformed into the
returned value.</p>

<p>The drand48(), lrand48(), and mrand48() functions store
the last 48-bit X_i generated in an internal buffer; that is
why the application shall ensure that these are initialized
prior to being invoked. The erand48(), nrand48(), and
jrand48() functions require the calling pro- gram to provide
storage for the successive X_i values in the array specified
as an argument when the functions are invoked. That is why
these routines do not have to be initialized; the calling
program merely has to place the desired initial value of X_i
into the array and pass it as an argument. By using
different arguments, erand48(), nrand48(), and jrand48()
allow separate modules of a large program to generate
several independent streams of pseudo-random numbers; that
is, the sequence of numbers in each stream shall not depend
upon how many times the routines are called to generate
numbers for the other streams.</p>

<p>The initializer function srand48() sets the high-order
32 bits of X_i to the low-order 32 bits contained in its
argument. The low-order 16 bits of X_i are set to the
arbitrary value 330E_16.</p>

<p>The initializer function seed48() sets the value of X_i
to the 48-bit value specified in the argument array. The
low-order 16 bits of X_i are set to the low-order 16 bits of
seed16v[0]. The mid-order 16 bits of X_i are set to the
low-order 16 bits of seed16v[1]. The high-order 16 bits of
X_i are set to the low-order 16 bits of seed16v[2]. In addi-
tion, the previous value of X_i is copied into a 48-bit
internal buffer, used only by seed48(), and a pointer to
this buffer is the value returned by seed48(). This returned
pointer, which can just be ignored if not needed, is useful
if a program is to be restarted from a given point at some
future time-use the pointer to get at and store the last X_i
value, and then use this value to reinitialize via seed48()
when the program is restarted.</p>

<p>The initializer function lcong48() allows the user to
specify the ini- tial X_i, the multiplier value a, and the
addend value c. Argument array elements param[0-2] specify
X_i, param[3-5] specify the multi- plier a, and param[6]
specifies the 16-bit addend c. After lcong48() is called, a
subsequent call to either srand48() or seed48() shall
restore the standard multiplier and addend values, a and c,
specified above.</p>

<p>The drand48(), lrand48(), and mrand48() functions need
not be reen- trant. A function that is not required to be
reentrant is not required to be thread-safe.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE As described in the DESCRIPTION above.</p>
