<p>XtSetLanguageProc(3) XT FUNCTIONS
XtSetLanguageProc(3)</p>

<p>NAME XtSetLanguageProc - set the language procedure</p>

<p>SYNTAX Widget XtSetLanguageProc(XtAppContext
app_context, XtLanguageProc proc, XtPointer
client_data);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS app_context Specifies the application context
in which the language pro- cedure is to be used, or
NULL.</p>

<p>proc Specifies the language procedure, or NULL.</p>

<p>client_data Specifies additional client data to be
passed to the language procedure when it is called.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION XtSetLanguageProc sets the language
procedure that will be called from XtDisplayInitialize for
all subsequent Displays initialized in the specified
application context. If app_context is NULL, the specified
language procedure is registered in all application contexts
created by the calling process, including any future
application contexts that may be created. If proc is NULL a
default language procedure is registered. XtSetLanguageProc
returns the previously registered language procedure. If a
language procedure has not yet been registered, the return
value is unspecified but if this return value is used in a
subsequent call to XtSetLanguageProc, it will cause the
default language procedure to be registered.</p>

<p>The default language procedure does the following:</p>

<p>&middot; Sets the locale according to the environment.
On ANSI C-based sys- tems this is done by calling setlocale(
LC_ALL, language ). If an error is encountered a warning
message is issued with XtWarning.</p>

<p>&middot; Calls XSupportsLocale to verify that the
current locale is sup- ported. If the locale is not
supported, a warning message is issued with XtWarning and
the locale is set to C.</p>

<p>&middot; Calls XSetLocaleModifiers specifying the empty
string.</p>

<p>&middot; Returns the value of the current locale. On
ANSI C-based systems this is the return value from a final
call to setlocale( LC_ALL, NULL ).</p>

<p>A client wishing to use this mechanism to establish
locale can do so by calling XtSetLanguageProc prior to
XtDisplayInitialize.</p>
