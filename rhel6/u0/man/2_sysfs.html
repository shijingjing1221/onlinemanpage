<p>NAME sysfs - get file system type information</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS int sysfs(int option, const char *fsname);</p>

<p>int sysfs(int option, unsigned int fs_index, char
*buf);</p>

<p>int sysfs(int option);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION sysfs() returns information about the file
system types currently present in the kernel. The specific
form of the sysfs() call and the information returned
depends on the option in effect:</p>

<p>1 Translate the file-system identifier string fsname
into a file-sys- tem type index.</p>

<p>2 Translate the file-system type index fs_index into a
null-terminated file-system identifier string. This string
will be written to the buffer pointed to by buf. Make sure
that buf has enough space to accept the string.</p>

<p>3 Return the total number of file system types currently
present in the kernel.</p>

<p>The numbering of the file-system type indexes begins
with zero.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, sysfs() returns the file-system
index for option 1, zero for option 2, and the number of
currently configured file systems for option 3. On error, -1
is returned, and errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS EFAULT Either fsname or buf is outside your
accessible address space.</p>

<p>EINVAL fsname is not a valid file-system type
identifier; fs_index is out-of-bounds; option is
invalid.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO SVr4.</p>

<p>NOTES On Linux with the proc file system mounted on
/proc, the same informa- tion can be derived from
/proc/filesystems.</p>

<p>BUGS There is no libc or glibc support. There is no way
to guess how large buf should be.</p>

<p>COLOPHON This page is part of release 3.22 of the Linux
man-pages project. A description of the project, and
information about reporting bugs, can be found at
