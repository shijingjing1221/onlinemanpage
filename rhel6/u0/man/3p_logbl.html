<p>LOGB(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual LOGB(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME logb, logbf, logbl - radix-independent exponent</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;math.h&gt;</p>

<p>double logb(double x); float logbf(float x); long double
logbl(long double x);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION These functions shall compute the exponent
of x, which is the integral part of log_r |x|, as a signed
floating-point value, for non-zero x, where r is the radix
of the machines floating-point arithmetic, which is the
value of FLT_RADIX defined in the &lt;float.h&gt;
header.</p>

<p>If x is subnormal it is treated as though it were
normalized; thus for finite positive x:</p>

<p>1 &lt;= x * FLT_RADIX**-logb(x) &lt; FLT_RADIX</p>

<p>An application wishing to check for error situations
should set errno to zero and call
feclearexcept(FE_ALL_EXCEPT) before calling these functions.
On return, if errno is non-zero or fetestexcept(FE_INVALID |
FE_DIVBYZERO | FE_OVERFLOW | FE_UNDERFLOW) is non-zero, an
error has occurred.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, these functions
shall return the exponent of x.</p>

<p>If x is &plusmn;0, a pole error shall occur and logb(),
logbf(), and logbl() shall return -HUGE_VAL, -HUGE_VALF, and
-HUGE_VALL, respectively.</p>

<p>If x is NaN, a NaN shall be returned.</p>

<p>If x is &plusmn;Inf, +Inf shall be returned.</p>

<p>ERRORS These functions shall fail if:</p>

<p>Pole Error The value of x is &plusmn;0.</p>

<p>If the integer expression (math_errhandling &amp;
MATH_ERRNO) is non-zero, then errno shall be set to
[ERANGE]. If the integer expression (math_errhandling &amp;
MATH_ERREXCEPT) is non-zero, then the divide-by- zero
floating-point exception shall be raised.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE On error, the expressions
(math_errhandling &amp; MATH_ERRNO) and (math_errhandling
&amp; MATH_ERREXCEPT) are independent of each other, but at
least one of them must be non-zero.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
