<p>PCAP-FILTER(7) PCAP-FILTER(7)</p>

<p>NAME pcap-filter - packet filter syntax</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pcap_compile() is used to compile a string
into a filter program. The resulting filter program can then
be applied to some stream of packets to determine which
packets will be supplied to pcap_loop(), pcap_dis- patch(),
pcap_next(), or pcap_next_ex().</p>

<p>The filter expression consists of one or more
primitives. Primitives usually consist of an id (name or
number) preceded by one or more qual- ifiers. There are
three different kinds of qualifier:</p>

<p>type qualifiers say what kind of thing the id name or
number refers to. Possible types are host, net , port and
portrange. E.g., host foo, net 128.3, port 20, portrange
6000-6008. If there is no type qualifier, host is
assumed.</p>

<p>dir qualifiers specify a particular transfer direction
to and/or from id. Possible directions are src, dst, src or
dst, src and dst, addr1, addr2, addr3, and addr4. E.g., src
foo, dst net 128.3 , src or dst port ftp-data. If there is
no dir quali- fier, src or dst is assumed. The addr1, addr2,
addr3, and addr4 qualifiers are only valid for IEEE 802.11
Wireless LAN link lay- ers. For some link layers, such as
SLIP and the cooked Linux capture mode used for the any
device and for some other device types, the inbound and
outbound qualifiers can be used to specify a desired
direction.</p>

<p>proto qualifiers restrict the match to a particular
protocol. Possi- ble protos are: ether, fddi, tr, wlan, ip,
ip6, arp, rarp, dec- net, tcp and udp. E.g., ether src foo,
arp net 128.3, tcp port 21, udp portrange 7000-7009 , wlan
addr2 0:2:3:4:5:6. If there is no proto qualifier, all
protocols consistent with the type are assumed. E.g., src
foo means (ip or arp or rarp) src foo (except the latter is
not legal syntax), net bar means (ip or arp or rarp) net bar
and port 53 means (tcp or udp) port 53.</p>

<p>[ fddi is actually an alias for ether; the parser treats
them iden- tically as meaning the data link level used on
the specified network interface. FDDI headers contain
Ethernet-like source and destination addresses, and often
contain Ethernet-like packet types, so you can filter on
these FDDI fields just as with the analogous Ethernet
fields. FDDI headers also contain other fields, but you
cannot name them explicitly in a filter expression.</p>

<p>Similarly, tr and wlan are aliases for ether; the
previous para- graphs statements about FDDI headers also
apply to Token Ring and 802.11 wireless LAN headers. For
802.11 headers, the destination address is the DA field and
the source address is the SA field; the BSSID, RA, and TA
fields arent tested.]</p>

<p>In addition to the above, there are some special
primitive keywords that dont follow the pattern: gateway,
broadcast, less, greater and arithmetic expressions. All of
these are described below.</p>

<p>More complex filter expressions are built up by using
the words and, or and not to combine primitives. E.g., host
foo and not port ftp and not port ftp-data. To save typing,
identical qualifier lists can be omitted. E.g., tcp dst port
ftp or ftp-data or domain is exactly the same as tcp dst
port ftp or tcp dst port ftp-data or tcp dst port
domain.</p>

<p>Allowable primitives are:</p>

<p>dst host host True if the IPv4/v6 destination field of
the packet is host, which may be either an address or a
name.</p>

<p>src host host True if the IPv4/v6 source field of the
packet is host.</p>

<p>host host True if either the IPv4/v6 source or
destination of the packet is host.</p>

<p>Any of the above host expressions can be prepended with
the key- words, ip, arp, rarp, or ip6 as in: ip host host
which is equivalent to: ether proto ip and host host If host
is a name with multiple IP addresses, each address will be
checked for a match.</p>

<p>ether dst ehost True if the Ethernet destination address
is ehost. Ehost may be either a name from /etc/ethers or a
number (see ethers(3N) for numeric format).</p>

<p>ether src ehost True if the Ethernet source address is
ehost.</p>

<p>ether host ehost True if either the Ethernet source or
destination address is ehost.</p>

<p>gateway host True if the packet used host as a gateway.
I.e., the Ethernet source or destination address was host
but neither the IP source nor the IP destination was host.
Host must be a name and must be found both by the machine s
host-name-to-IP-address resolu- tion mechanisms (host name
file, DNS, NIS, etc.) and by the machine s
host-name-to-Ethernet-address resolution mechanism
(/etc/ethers, etc.). (An equivalent expression is ether host
ehost and not host host which can be used with either names
or numbers for host / ehost.) This syntax does not work in
IPv6-enabled configuration at this moment.</p>

<p>dst net net True if the IPv4/v6 destination address of
the packet has a net- work number of net. Net may be either
a name from the networks database (/etc/networks, etc.) or a
network number. An IPv4 network number can be written as a
dotted quad (e.g., 192.168.1.0), dotted triple (e.g.,
192.168.1), dotted pair (e.g, 172.16), or single number
(e.g., 10); the netmask is 255.255.255.255 for a dotted quad
(which means that its really a host match), 255.255.255.0
for a dotted triple, 255.255.0.0 for a dotted pair, or
255.0.0.0 for a single number. An IPv6 network number must
be written out fully; the netmask is
ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff, so IPv6 &quot;network&quot; matches
are really always host matches, and a network match requires
a netmask length.</p>

<p>src net net True if the IPv4/v6 source address of the
packet has a network number of net.</p>

<p>net net True if either the IPv4/v6 source or destination
address of the packet has a network number of net.</p>

<p>net net mask netmask True if the IPv4 address matches
net with the specific netmask. May be qualified with src or
dst. Note that this syntax is not valid for IPv6 net.</p>

<p>net net/len True if the IPv4/v6 address matches net with
a netmask len bits wide. May be qualified with src or
dst.</p>

<p>dst port port True if the packet is ip/tcp, ip/udp,
ip6/tcp or ip6/udp and has a destination port value of port.
The port can be a number or a name used in /etc/services
(see tcp(4P) and udp(4P)). If a name is used, both the port
number and protocol are checked. If a number or ambiguous
name is used, only the port number is checked (e.g., dst
port 513 will print both tcp/login traffic and udp/who
traffic, and port domain will print both tcp/domain and
udp/domain traffic).</p>

<p>src port port True if the packet has a source port value
of port.</p>

<p>port port True if either the source or destination port
of the packet is port.</p>

<p>dst portrange port1-port2 True if the packet is ip/tcp,
ip/udp, ip6/tcp or ip6/udp and has a destination port value
between port1 and port2. port1 and port2 are interpreted in
the same fashion as the port parameter for port.</p>

<p>src portrange port1-port2 True if the packet has a
source port value between port1 and port2.</p>

<p>portrange port1-port2 True if either the source or
destination port of the packet is between port1 and
port2.</p>

<p>Any of the above port or port range expressions can be
prepended with the keywords, tcp or udp, as in: tcp src port
port which matches only tcp packets whose source port is
port.</p>

<p>less length True if the packet has a length less than or
equal to length. This is equivalent to: len &lt;=
length.</p>

<p>greater length True if the packet has a length greater
than or equal to length. This is equivalent to: len &gt;=
length.</p>

<p>ip proto protocol True if the packet is an IPv4 packet
(see ip(4P)) of protocol type protocol. Protocol can be a
number or one of the names icmp, icmp6, igmp, igrp, pim, ah,
esp, vrrp, udp, or tcp. Note that the identifiers tcp, udp,
and icmp are also keywords and must be escaped via backslash
(, which is \ in the C-shell. Note that this primitive does
not chase the protocol header chain.</p>

<p>ip6 proto protocol True if the packet is an IPv6 packet
of protocol type protocol. Note that this primitive does not
chase the protocol header chain.</p>

<p>ip6 protochain protocol True if the packet is IPv6
packet, and contains protocol header with type protocol in
its protocol header chain. For example, ip6 protochain 6
matches any IPv6 packet with TCP protocol header in the
protocol header chain. The packet may contain, for example,
authentica- tion header, routing header, or hop-by-hop
option header, between IPv6 header and TCP header. The BPF
code emitted by this primitive is complex and cannot be
optimized by the BPF optimizer code, so this can be somewhat
slow.</p>

<p>ip protochain protocol Equivalent to ip6 protochain
protocol, but this is for IPv4.</p>

<p>ether broadcast True if the packet is an Ethernet
broadcast packet. The ether keyword is optional.</p>

<p>ip broadcast True if the packet is an IPv4 broadcast
packet. It checks for both the all-zeroes and all-ones
broadcast conventions, and looks up the subnet mask on the
interface on which the capture is being done.</p>

<p>If the subnet mask of the interface on which the capture
is being done is not available, either because the interface
on which capture is being done has no netmask or because the
cap- ture is being done on the Linux &quot;any&quot;
interface, which can cap- ture on more than one interface,
this check will not work cor- rectly.</p>

<p>ether multicast True if the packet is an Ethernet
multicast packet. The ether keyword is optional. This is
shorthand for ether[0] &amp; 1 != 0.</p>

<p>ip multicast True if the packet is an IPv4 multicast
packet.</p>

<p>ip6 multicast True if the packet is an IPv6 multicast
packet.</p>

<p>ether proto protocol True if the packet is of ether type
protocol. Protocol can be a number or one of the names ip,
ip6, arp, rarp, atalk, aarp, dec- net, sca, lat, mopdl,
moprc, iso, stp, ipx, or netbeui. Note these identifiers are
also keywords and must be escaped via backslash (.</p>

<p>[In the case of FDDI (e.g., fddi protocol arp), Token
Ring (e.g., tr protocol arp), and IEEE 802.11 wireless LANS
(e.g., wlan protocol arp ), for most of those protocols, the
protocol identification comes from the 802.2 Logical Link
Control (LLC) header, which is usually layered on top of the
FDDI, Token Ring, or 802.11 header.</p>

<p>When filtering for most protocol identifiers on FDDI,
Token Ring, or 802.11, the filter checks only the protocol
ID field of an LLC header in so-called SNAP format with an
Organizational Unit Identifier (OUI) of 0x000000, for
encapsulated Ethernet; it doesnt check whether the packet is
in SNAP format with an OUI of 0x000000. The exceptions
are:</p>

<p>iso the filter checks the DSAP (Destination Service
Access Point) and SSAP (Source Service Access Point) fields
of the LLC header;</p>

<p>stp and netbeui the filter checks the DSAP of the LLC
header;</p>

<p>atalk the filter checks for a SNAP-format packet with an
OUI of 0x080007 and the AppleTalk etype.</p>

<p>In the case of Ethernet, the filter checks the Ethernet
type field for most of those protocols. The exceptions
are:</p>

<p>iso, stp, and netbeui the filter checks for an 802.3
frame and then checks the LLC header as it does for FDDI,
Token Ring, and 802.11;</p>

<p>atalk the filter checks both for the AppleTalk etype in
an Eth- ernet frame and for a SNAP-format packet as it does
for FDDI, Token Ring, and 802.11;</p>

<p>aarp the filter checks for the AppleTalk ARP etype in
either an Ethernet frame or an 802.2 SNAP frame with an OUI
of 0x000000;</p>

<p>ipx the filter checks for the IPX etype in an Ethernet
frame, the IPX DSAP in the LLC header, the
802.3-with-no-LLC- header encapsulation of IPX, and the IPX
etype in a SNAP frame.</p>

<p>decnet src host True if the DECNET source address is
host, which may be an address of the form 10.123, or a
DECNET host name. [DECNET host name support is only
available on ULTRIX systems that are configured to run
DECNET.]</p>

<p>decnet dst host True if the DECNET destination address
is host.</p>

<p>decnet host host True if either the DECNET source or
destination address is host.</p>

bad-offset, fragment, short, normal- ize, and memory
(applies only to packets logged by OpenBSDs or FreeBSDs
pf(4)).</p>

<p>rset name True if the packet was logged as matching the
specified PF rule- set name of an anchored ruleset (applies
only to packets logged by OpenBSDs or FreeBSDs pf(4)).</p>

<p>ruleset name Synonomous with the rset modifier.</p>

<p>srnr num True if the packet was logged as matching the
specified PF rule number of an anchored ruleset (applies
only to packets logged by OpenBSDs or FreeBSDs pf(4)).</p>

<p>subrulenum num Synonomous with the srnr modifier.</p>

<p>action act True if PF took the specified action when the
packet was logged. Known actions are: pass and block and,
with later versions of pf(4)), nat, rdr, binat and scrub
(applies only to packets logged by OpenBSDs or FreeBSDs
pf(4)).</p>

<p>wlan addr1 ehost True if the first IEEE 802.11 address
is ehost.</p>

<p>wlan addr2 ehost True if the second IEEE 802.11 address,
if present, is ehost. The second address field is used in
all frames except for CTS (Clear To Send) and ACK
(Acknowledgment) control frames.</p>

<p>wlan addr3 ehost True if the third IEEE 802.11 address,
if present, is ehost. The third address field is used in
management and data frames, but not in control frames.</p>

<p>wlan addr4 ehost True if the fourth IEEE 802.11 address,
if present, is ehost. The fourth address field is only used
for WDS (Wireless Distri- bution System) frames.</p>

<p>ip, ip6, arp, rarp, atalk, aarp, decnet, iso, stp, ipx,
netbeui Abbreviations for: ether proto p where p is one of
the above protocols.</p>

<p>lat, moprc, mopdl Abbreviations for: ether proto p where
p is one of the above protocols. Note that not all appli-
cations using pcap(3) currently know how to parse these
proto- cols.</p>

<p>type wlan_type True if the IEEE 802.11 frame type
matches the specified wlan_type. Valid wlan_types are: mgt,
ctl and data.</p>

<p>type wlan_type subtype wlan_subtype True if the IEEE
802.11 frame type matches the specified wlan_type and frame
subtype matches the specified wlan_subtype.</p>

<p>If the specified wlan_type is mgt, then valid
wlan_subtypes are: assoc-req, assoc-resp, reassoc-req,
reassoc-resp, probe-req, probe-resp, beacon, atim, disassoc,
auth and deauth.</p>

<p>If the specified wlan_type is ctl, then valid
wlan_subtypes are: ps-poll, rts, cts, ack, cf-end and
cf-end-ack.</p>

<p>If the specified wlan_type is data, then valid
wlan_subtypes are: data, data-cf-ack, data-cf-poll,
data-cf-ack-poll, null, cf-ack, cf-poll, cf-ack-poll,
qos-data, qos-data-cf-ack, qos- data-cf-poll,
qos-data-cf-ack-poll, qos, qos-cf-poll and qos-cf-
ack-poll.</p>

<p>subtype wlan_subtype True if the IEEE 802.11 frame
subtype matches the specified wlan_subtype and frame has the
type to which the specified wlan_subtype belongs.</p>

<p>dir dir True if the IEEE 802.11 frame direction matches
the specified dir. Valid directions are: nods, tods, fromds,
dstods, or a numeric value.</p>

<p>vlan [vlan_id] True if the packet is an IEEE 802.1Q VLAN
packet. If [vlan_id] is specified, only true if the packet
has the specified vlan_id. Note that the first vlan keyword
encountered in expression changes the decoding offsets for
the remainder of expression on the assumption that the
packet is a VLAN packet. The vlan [vlan_id] expression may
be used more than once, to filter on VLAN hierarchies. Each
use of that expression increments the filter offsets by
4.</p>

<p>For example: vlan 100 &amp;&amp; vlan 200 filters on
VLAN 200 encapsulated within VLAN 100, and vlan &amp;&amp;
vlan 300 &amp;&amp; ip filters IPv4 protocols encapsulated
in VLAN 300 encapsulated within any higher order VLAN.</p>

<p>mpls [label_num] True if the packet is an MPLS packet.
If [label_num] is speci- fied, only true is the packet has
the specified label_num. Note that the first mpls keyword
encountered in expression changes the decoding offsets for
the remainder of expression on the assumption that the
packet is a MPLS-encapsulated IP packet. The mpls
[label_num] expression may be used more than once, to filter
on MPLS hierarchies. Each use of that expression incre-
ments the filter offsets by 4.</p>

<p>For example: mpls 100000 &amp;&amp; mpls 1024 filters
packets with an outer label of 100000 and an inner label of
1024, and mpls &amp;&amp; mpls 1024 &amp;&amp; host
192.9.200.1 filters packets to or from 192.9.200.1 with an
inner label of 1024 and any outer label.</p>

<p>pppoed True if the packet is a PPP-over-Ethernet
Discovery packet (Eth- ernet type 0x8863).</p>

<p>pppoes True if the packet is a PPP-over-Ethernet Session
packet (Ether- net type 0x8864). Note that the first pppoes
keyword encoun- tered in expression changes the decoding
offsets for the remain- der of expression on the assumption
that the packet is a PPPoE session packet.</p>

<p>For example: pppoes &amp;&amp; ip filters IPv4 protocols
encapsulated in PPPoE.</p>

<p>tcp, udp, icmp Abbreviations for: ip proto p or ip6
proto p where p is one of the above protocols.</p>

<p>iso proto protocol True if the packet is an OSI packet
of protocol type protocol. Protocol can be a number or one
of the names clnp, esis, or isis.</p>

<p>clnp, esis, isis Abbreviations for: iso proto p where p
is one of the above protocols.</p>

<p>l1, l2, iih, lsp, snp, csnp, psnp Abbreviations for
IS-IS PDU types.</p>

<p>vpi n True if the packet is an ATM packet, for SunATM on
Solaris, with a virtual path identifier of n.</p>

<p>vci n True if the packet is an ATM packet, for SunATM on
Solaris, with a virtual channel identifier of n.</p>

<p>lane True if the packet is an ATM packet, for SunATM on
Solaris, and is an ATM LANE packet. Note that the first lane
keyword encoun- tered in expression changes the tests done
in the remainder of expression on the assumption that the
packet is either a LANE emulated Ethernet packet or a LANE
LE Control packet. If lane isnt specified, the tests are
done under the assumption that the packet is an
LLC-encapsulated packet.</p>

<p>llc True if the packet is an ATM packet, for SunATM on
Solaris, and is an LLC-encapsulated packet.</p>

<p>oamf4s True if the packet is an ATM packet, for SunATM
on Solaris, and is a segment OAM F4 flow cell (VPI=0 &amp;
VCI=3).</p>

<p>oamf4e True if the packet is an ATM packet, for SunATM
on Solaris, and is an end-to-end OAM F4 flow cell (VPI=0
&amp; VCI=4).</p>

<p>oamf4 True if the packet is an ATM packet, for SunATM on
Solaris, and is a segment or end-to-end OAM F4 flow cell
(VPI=0 &amp; (VCI=3 | VCI=4)).</p>

<p>oam True if the packet is an ATM packet, for SunATM on
Solaris, and is a segment or end-to-end OAM F4 flow cell
(VPI=0 &amp; (VCI=3 | VCI=4)).</p>

<p>metac True if the packet is an ATM packet, for SunATM on
Solaris, and is on a meta signaling circuit (VPI=0 &amp;
VCI=1).</p>

<p>bcc True if the packet is an ATM packet, for SunATM on
Solaris, and is on a broadcast signaling circuit (VPI=0
&amp; VCI=2).</p>

<p>sc True if the packet is an ATM packet, for SunATM on
Solaris, and is on a signaling circuit (VPI=0 &amp;
VCI=5).</p>

<p>ilmic True if the packet is an ATM packet, for SunATM on
Solaris, and is on an ILMI circuit (VPI=0 &amp; VCI=16).</p>

<p>connectmsg True if the packet is an ATM packet, for
SunATM on Solaris, and is on a signaling circuit and is a
Q.2931 Setup, Call Proceed- ing, Connect, Connect Ack,
Release, or Release Done message.</p>

<p>metaconnect True if the packet is an ATM packet, for
SunATM on Solaris, and is on a meta signaling circuit and is
a Q.2931 Setup, Call Pro- ceeding, Connect, Release, or
Release Done message.</p>

<p>expr relop expr True if the relation holds, where relop
is one of &gt;, &lt;, &gt;=, &lt;=, =, !=, and expr is an
arithmetic expression composed of integer constants
(expressed in standard C syntax), the normal binary
operators [+, -, *, /, &amp;, |, &lt;&lt;, &gt;&gt;], a
length operator, and special packet data accessors. Note
that all comparisons are unsigned, so that, for example,
0x80000000 and 0xffffffff are &gt; 0. To access data inside
the packet, use the following syntax: proto [ expr : size ]
Proto is one of ether, fddi, tr, wlan, ppp, slip, link, ip,
arp, rarp, tcp, udp, icmp, ip6 or radio, and indicates the
protocol layer for the index operation. (ether, fddi, wlan,
tr, ppp, slip and link all refer to the link layer. radio
refers to the &quot;radio header&quot; added to some 802.11
captures.) Note that tcp, udp and other upper-layer protocol
types only apply to IPv4, not IPv6 (this will be fixed in
the future). The byte offset, rela- tive to the indicated
protocol layer, is given by expr. Size is optional and
indicates the number of bytes in the field of interest; it
can be either one, two, or four, and defaults to one. The
length operator, indicated by the keyword len, gives the
length of the packet.</p>

<p>For example, ether[0] &amp; 1 != 0 catches all multicast
traffic. The expression ip[0] &amp; 0xf != 5 catches all
IPv4 packets with options. The expression ip[6:2] &amp;
0x1fff = 0 catches only unfragmented IPv4 datagrams and frag
zero of fragmented IPv4 datagrams. This check is implicitly
applied to the tcp and udp index operations. For instance,
tcp[0] always means the first byte of the TCP header, and
never means the first byte of an intervening fragment.</p>

<p>Some offsets and field values may be expressed as names
rather than as numeric values. The following protocol header
field offsets are available: icmptype (ICMP type field),
icmpcode (ICMP code field), and tcpflags (TCP flags
field).</p>

<p>The following ICMP type field values are available:
icmp-echore- ply, icmp-unreach, icmp-sourcequench,
icmp-redirect, icmp-echo, icmp-routeradvert,
icmp-routersolicit, icmp-timxceed, icmp- paramprob,
icmp-tstamp, icmp-tstampreply, icmp-ireq, icmp-ire- qreply,
icmp-maskreq, icmp-maskreply.</p>

<p>The following TCP flags field values are available:
tcp-fin, tcp-syn, tcp-rst, tcp-push, tcp-ack, tcp-urg.</p>

<p>Primitives may be combined using:</p>

<p>A parenthesized group of primitives and operators
(parentheses are special to the Shell and must be
escaped).</p>

<p>Negation (! or not).</p>

<p>Concatenation (&amp;&amp; or and).</p>

<p>Alternation (|| or or).</p>

<p>Negation has highest precedence. Alternation and
concatenation have equal precedence and associate left to
right. Note that explicit and tokens, not juxtaposition, are
now required for concatenation.</p>

<p>If an identifier is given without a keyword, the most
recent keyword is assumed. For example, not host vs and ace
is short for not host vs and host ace which should not be
confused with not ( host vs or ace )</p>

<p>EXAMPLES To select all packets arriving at or departing
from sundown: host sundown</p>

<p>To select traffic between helios and either hot or ace:
host helios and( hot or ac)</p>

<p>To select all IP packets between ace and any host except
helios: ip host ace and not helios</p>

<p>To select all traffic between local hosts and hosts at
Berkeley: net ucb-ether</p>

<p>To select all ftp traffic through internet gateway snup:
gateway snup and (port ftp or ftp-data)</p>

<p>To select traffic neither sourced from nor destined for
local hosts (if you gateway to one other net, this stuff
should never make it onto your local net). ip and not net
localnet</p>

<p>To select the start and end packets (the SYN and FIN
packets) of each TCP conversation that involves a non-local
host. tcp[tcpflags] &amp; (tcp-syn|tcp-fin) != 0 and not src
and dst net localnet</p>

<p>To select all IPv4 HTTP packets to and from port 80,
i.e. print only packets that contain data, not, for example,
SYN and FIN packets and ACK-only packets. (IPv6 is left as
an exercise for the reader.) tcp port 80 and (((ip[2:2] -
((ip[0]&amp;0xf)&lt;&lt;2)) - ((tcp[12]&amp;0xf0)&gt;&gt;2))
!= 0)</p>

<p>To select IP packets longer than 576 bytes sent through
gateway snup: gateway snup and ip[2:2] &gt; 576</p>

<p>To select IP broadcast or multicast packets that were
not sent via Eth- ernet broadcast or multicast: ether[0]
&amp; 1 = 0 and ip[16] &gt;= 224</p>

<p>To select all ICMP packets that are not echo
requests/replies (i.e., not ping packets): icmp[icmptype] !=
icmp-echo and icmp[icmptype] != icmp-echoreply</p>

<p>Filter expressions on fields other than those in Token
Ring headers will not correctly handle source-routed Token
Ring packets.</p>

<p>Filter expressions on fields other than those in 802.11
headers will not correctly handle 802.11 data packets with
both To DS and From DS set.</p>

<p>ip6 proto should chase header chain, but at this moment
it does not. ip6 protochain is supplied for this
behavior.</p>

<p>Arithmetic expression against transport layer headers,
like tcp[0], does not work against IPv6 packets. It only
looks at IPv4 packets.</p>
