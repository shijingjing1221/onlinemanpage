<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pamtotiff reads a PNM or PAM image as input and produces
a TIFF file as output.</p>

<p>Actually, it handles multi-image Netpbm streams,
producing multi-image TIFF streams (i.e. a TIFF stream with
multiple directories). But before Netpbm 10.27 (March 2005),
it ignored all but the first Netpbm image in the input
stream.</p>

<p>The Output File The output goes to Standard Output.
pamtotiff approaches this output file differently from Unix
and Netpbm convention. This is entirely due to pamtotiffs
use of the TIFF library to do all TIFF output.</p>

<p>&middot; The output file must be seekable. pamtotiff
does not write it sequentially. Therefore, you cant use a
pipe; you cant pipe the output of pamtotiff to some other
program. But any regular file should work.</p>

<p>&middot; If the output file descriptor is readable, you
must either spec- ify -append so as to add to the existing
file, or make sure the file is empty. Otherwise, pamtotiff
will fail with an unhelpful message telling you that a TIFF
library function failed to open the TIFF output stream.</p>

<p>&middot; If you are converting multiple images (your
input stream con- tains multiple images), the output file
must be both readable and writable.</p>

<p>If youre using a Unix command shell to run pamtotiff,
you use facili- ties of your shell to set up Standard
Output. In Bash, for example, you would set up a write-only
Standard Output to the file /tmp/myim- age.tiff like
this:</p>

<p>$ pamtotiff myimage.pnm &gt;/tmp/myimage.tiff</p>

<p>In Bash, you would set up a read/write Standard Output
to the file /tmp/myimage.tiff like this:</p>

<p>$ pamtotiff myimage.pnm 1&lt;&gt;/tmp/myimage.tiff</p>

<p>TIFF Capability pamtotiff uses the Libtiff.org TIFF
library (or whatever equivalent you provide) to generate the
TIFF output. Details of the format it pro- duces are
therefore controlled by that library.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Compression By default, pamtotiff creates a TIFF
file with no compression. This is your best bet most of the
time. If you want to try another compression scheme or tweak
some of the other even more obscure output options, there
are a number of options which which to play.</p>

<p>Before Netpbm 8.4 (April 2000), the default was to use
LZW compression. But then new releases of the TIFF library
started omitting the LZW com- pression capability due to
concern about patents on LZW. So since then, the default has
been no compression. The LZW patents have now expired and
new TIFF libraries do LZW, but the pamtotiff behavior
remains the same for compatibility with older TIFF libraries
and appli- cations of pamtotiff.</p>

<p>The -none, -packbits, -lzw, -g3, -g4, -flate, and
-adobeflate options are used to override the default and set
the compression scheme used in creating the output file.</p>

<p>The -predictor option is meaningful only with LZW
compression: a pre- dictor value of 2 causes each scanline
of the output image to undergo horizontal differencing
before it is encoded; a value of 1 forces each scanline to
be encoded without differencing. By default, pamtotiff
creates a TIFF file with msb-to-lsb fill order. The -msb2lsb
and -lsb2msb options are used to override the default and
set the fill order used in creating the file.</p>

<p>With some older TIFF libraries, -lzw doesn t work
because the TIFF library doesnt do LZW compression. This is
because of concerns about Unisyss patent on LZW which was
then in force. Actually, with very old TIFF libraries, -lzw
works because no distributors of the TIFF library were
sensitive yet to the patent issue.</p>

<p>-flate chooses flate compression, which is the
patent-free compres- sion common in the Unix world
implemented by the Z library. It is what the PNG format
uses.</p>

<p>Fax Compression</p>

<p>If you have bilevel data (e.g. PBM), you can generate a
TIFF that uses the same compression scheme specified for use
by fax machines. See the
FaxFormat(1)pageformoreinformationonthese compression
schemes.</p>

<p>These formats all relate to ITU Group 3 and Group 4 fax
machine stan- dards.</p>

<p>The -g3 option chooses MH or MR compression: MR with the
additional option -2d; MH without it. -g4 selects MMR. The
option names are a little unfortunate and historical, but
are consistent with the TIFF specification.</p>

<p>MMR has a better compression ratio than the other
two.</p>

<p>-fill specifies that for MH or MR compression, each
encoded scanline shall be zero-filled to a byte
boundary.</p>

<p>-2d and -fill are meaningful only with -g3.</p>

<p>Fill Order The -msb2lsb and lsb2msb options control the
fill order.</p>

<p>The fill order is the order in which pixels are packed
into a byte in the Tiff raster, in the case that there are
multiple pixels per byte. msb-to-lsb means that the leftmost
columns go into the most significant bits of the byte in the
Tiff image. However, there is considerable confusion about
the meaning of fill order. Some believe it means whether 16
bit sample values in the Tiff image are little-endian or
big-endian. This is totally erroneous (The endianness of
integers in a Tiff image is designated by the image s magic
number). However, ImageMagick and older Netpbm both have
been known to implement that interpretation. 2001.09.06.</p>

<p>If the image does not have sub-byte pixels, these
options have no effect other than to set the value of the
FILLORDER tag in the Tiff image (which may be useful for
those programs that misinterpret the tag with reference to
16 bit samples).</p>

<p>Color Space -color tells pamtotiff to produce a color,
as opposed to grayscale, TIFF image if the input is PPM,
even if it contains only shades of gray. Without this
option, pamtotiff produces a grayscale TIFF image if the
input is PPM and contains only shades of gray, and at most
256 shades. Otherwise, it produces a color TIFF output. For
PBM and PGM input, pamtotiff always produces grayscale TIFF
output and this option has no effect.</p>

<p>The -color option can prevent pamtotiff from making two
passes through the input file, thus improving speed and
memory usage. See Multiple Passes .</p>

<p>-truecolor tells pamtotiff to produce the 24-bit RGB
form of TIFF out- put if it is producing a color TIFF image.
Without this option, pamto- tiff produces a colormapped
(paletted) TIFF image unless there are more than 256 colors
(and in the latter case, issues a warning).</p>

<p>The -truecolor option can prevent pamtotiff from making
two passes through the input file, thus improving speed and
memory usage. See Multiple Passes .</p>

<p>The -color and -truecolor options did not exist before
Netpbm 9.21 (December 2001).</p>

<p>If pamtotiff produces a grayscale TIFF image, this
option has no effect.</p>

<p>The -minisblack and -miniswhite options force the output
image to have a minimum is black or minimum is white
photometric, respectively. If you don t specify either,
pamtotiff uses minimum is black except when using Group 3 or
Group 4 compression, in which case pamtotiff fol- lows CCITT
fax standards and uses minimum is white. This usually
results in better compression and is generally preferred for
bilevel coding.</p>

<p>Before February 2001, pamtotiff always produced minimum
is black, due to a bug. In either case, pamtotiff sets the
photometric interpreta- tion tag in the TIFF output
according to which photometric is actually used.</p>

<p>The -indexbits option is meaningful only for a
colormapped (paletted) image. In this kind of image, the
raster contains values which are indexes into a table of
colors, with the indexes normally taking less space that the
color description in the table. pamtotiff can generate
indexes of 1, 2, 4, or 8 bits. By default, it will use 8,
because many programs that interpret TIFF images cant handle
any other width.</p>

<p>But if you have a small number of colors, you can make
your image con- siderably smaller by allowing fewer than 8
bits per index, using the -indexbits option. The value is a
comma-separated list of the bit widths you allow. pamtotiff
chooses the smallest width you allow that allows it to index
the entire color table. If you don t allow any such width,
pamtotiff fails. Normally, the only useful value for this
option is 1,2,4,8, because a program either understands the
8 bit width (default) or understands them all.</p>

<p>In a Baseline TIFF image, according to the 1992 TIFF 6.0
specification, 4 and 8 are the only valid widths. There are
no formal standards that allow any other values.</p>

<p>This option was added in June 2002. Before that, only 8
bit indices were possible.</p>

<p>Extra Tags There are lots of tag types in the TIFF
format that don t correspond to any information in the PNM
format or to anything in the conversion pro- cess. For
example, a TIFF_ARTIST tag names the artist who created the
image.</p>

<p>You can tell pamtotiff explicitly to include tags such
as this in its output with the -tag option. You identify a
list of tag types and val- ues and pamtotiff includes a tag
in the output for each item in your list.</p>

<p>The value of -tag is the list of tags, like this
example:</p>


<p>-tag=subfiletype=reducedimage,documentname=Fred,xposition=25</p>

<p>As you see, it is a list of tag specifications separated
by commas. Each tag specification is a name and a value
separated by an equal sign. The name is the name of the tag
type, except in arbitrary upper/lower case. One place to see
the names of TIFF tag types is in the TIFF library s tiff.h
file, where there is a macro defined for each consisting of
TIFF_ plus the name. E.g. for the SUBFILETYPE tag type,
there is a macro TIFF_SUBFILETYPE.</p>

<p>The format of the value specification for a tag (stuff
after the equal sign) depends upon what kind of value the
tag type has:</p>

<p>&middot; Integer: a decimal number</p>

<p>&middot; Floating point number: a decimal number</p>

<p>&middot; String: a string</p>

<p>&middot; Enumerated (For example, a subfiletype tag
takes an enumerated value. Its possible values are
REDUCEDIMAGE, PAGE, and MASK.): The name of the value. You
can see the possible value names in the TIFF library s
tiff.h foile, where there is a macro defined for each
consisting of a qualifier plus the value name. E.g. for the
REDUCEDIMAGE value of a SUBFILETYPE tag, you see the macro
FILETYPE_REDUCEDIMAGE.</p>

<p>The TIFF format assigns a unique number to each
enumerated value and you can specify that number, in
decimal, as an alternative. This is useful if you are using
an extension of TIFF that pamto- tiff doesnt know about.</p>

<p>If you specify a tag type with -tag that is not
independent of the con- tent of your PNM source image and
pamtotiff s conversion process (i.e. a tag type in which
pamtotiff is interested), pamtotiff fails. For example, you
cannot specify an IMAGEWIDTH tag with -tag, because pamto-
tiff generates an IMAGEWIDTH tag that gives the actual width
of the image.</p>

<p>-tag was new in Netpbm 10.31 (December 2005).</p>

<p>Other You can use the -rowsperstrip option to set the
number of rows (scan- lines) in each strip of data in the
output file. By default, the out- put file has the number of
rows per strip set to a value that will ensure each strip is
no more than 8 kilobytes long.</p>

<p>The -append option tells pamtotiff to add images to the
existing output file (a TIFF file may contain multiple
images) instead of the default, which is to replace the
output file.</p>

<p>-append was new in Netpbm 10.27 (March 2005).</p>

<p>NOTES There are myriad variations of the TIFF format,
and this program gener- ates only a few of them. pamtotiff
creates a grayscale TIFF file if its input is a PBM
(monochrome) or PGM (grayscale) or equivalent PAM file.
pamtotiff also creates a grayscale file if it input is PPM
(color) or equivalent PAM, but there is only one color in
the image.</p>

<p>If the input is a PPM (color) file and there are 256
colors or fewer, but more than 1, pamtotiff generates a
color palette TIFF file. If there are more colors than that,
pamtotiff generates an RGB (not RGBA) single plane TIFF
file. Use pnmtotiffcmyk to generate the cyan-
magenta-yellow-black ink color separation TIFF format.</p>

<p>The number of bits per sample in the TIFF output is
determined by the maxval of the Netpbm input. If the maxval
is less than 256, the bits per sample in the output is the
smallest number that can encode the maxval. If the maxval is
greater than or equal to 256, there are 16 bits per sample
in the output.</p>

<p>Extra Channels Like most Netpbm programs, pamtotiffs
function is mostly undefined if the input is PAM image with
tuple type other than BLACKANDWHITE, GRAYSCALE, or RGB. Most
of the statements in this manual assume the input is not
such an exotic PAM. But there is a little defined pro-
cessing of other PAM subformats.</p>

<p>pamtotiff assumes any 1 plane PAM image is BLACKANDWHITE
or GRAYSCALE (and doesnt distinguish between those two).</p>

<p>pamtotiff assumes a PAM with more than 1 plane is of
tuple type RGB except with that number of planes instead of
3. pamtotiff doesnt really understand red, green, and blue,
so it has no trouble with a 2-component or 5-component color
space. The TIFF format allows an arbitrary number of color
compoonents, so pamtotiff simply maps the PAM planes
directly to TIFF color components. I dont know if the
meanings of 5 components in a TIFF image are standard at
all, but the function is there if you want to use it.</p>

<p>Note that pamtotiff may generate either a truecolor or
colormapped image with an arbitrary number of color
components. In the truecolor case, the raster has that
number of planes. In the colormapped case, the raster has of
course 1 plane, but the color map has all the color
components in it.</p>

<p>The most common reason for a PAM to have extra planes is
when the tuple type is xxx_ALPHA, which means the highest
numbered plane is a trans- parency plane (alpha channel). At
least one user found that a TIFF with an extra plane for
transparency was useful.</p>

<p>Note that the grayscale detection works on N-component
colors, so if your planes arent really color components,
youll want to disable this via the -color option.</p>

<p>Multiple Passes pamtotiff reads the input image once if
it can, and otherwise twice. It needs that second pass
(which happens before the main pass, of course) to analyze
the colors in the image and generate a color map (palette)
and determine if the image is grayscale. So the second pass
happens only when the input is PPM. And you can avoid it
then by spec- ifying both the -truecolor and -color
options.</p>

<p>If the input image is small enough to fit in your
systems file cache, the second pass is very fast. If not, it
requires reading from disk twice, which can be slow.</p>

<p>When the input is from a file that cannot be rewound and
reread, pamto- tiff reads the entire input image into a
temporary file which can, and works from that. Even if it
needs only one pass.</p>

<p>Before Netpbm 9.21 (December 2001), pamtotiff always
read the entire image into virtual memory and then did one,
two, or three passes through the memory copy. The -truecolor
and -color options did not exist. The passes through memory
would involve page faults if the entire image did not fit
into real memory. The image in memory required considerably
more memory (12 bytes per pixel) than the cached file
version of the image would.</p>

<p>Resolution A Tiff image may contain information about
the resolution of the image, which means how big in real
dimensions (centimeters, etc.) each pixel in the raster is.
That information is in the TIFF XRESOLUTION, YRESO- LUTION,
and RESOLUTIONUNIT tags. By default, pamtotiff does not
include any tags of these types, but you can specify them
with the -tags option.</p>

<p>There are also options -xresolution, -yresolution, and
-resolutionunit, but those are obsolete. Before -tags
existed (before Netpbm 10.31 (December 2005), they were the
only way.</p>

<p>Note that the number of pixels in the image and how much
information each contains is determined independently from
the setting of the reso- lution tags. The number of pixels
in the output is the same as in the input, and each pixel
contains the same information. For your resolu- tion tags to
be meaningful, they have to consistent with whatever cre-
ated the PNM input. E.g. if a scanner turned a 10 centimeter
wide image into a 1000 pixel wide PNM image, then your
horizontal resolution is 100 pixels per centimeter, and if
your XRESOLUTION tag says anything else, something that
prints your TIFF image wont print the proper 10 centimeter
image.</p>

<p>The value of the XRESOLUTION tag is a floating point
decimal number that tells how many pixels there are per unit
of distance in the hori- zontal direction. -yresolution is
analogous for the vertical direc- tion.</p>

<p>The unit of distance is given by the value of the
RESOLUTIONUNIT option. That value is either INCH,
CENTIMETER, or NONE. NONE means the unit is arbitrary or
unspecified. This could mean that the creator and user of
the image have a separate agreement as to what the unit is.
But usually, it just means that the horizontal and vertical
resolution values cannot be used for anything except to
determine aspect ratio (because even though the unit is
arbitrary or unspecified, it has to be the same for both
resolution numbers).</p>

<p>If you dont use a -tag option to specify the resolution
tag and use the obsolete options instead, note the
following:</p>

<p>&middot; If you dont include an specify -xresolution,
the Tiff image does not contain horizontal resolution
information. Likewise for -yresolution. If you don t specify
-resolutionunit, the default is inches.</p>

<p>&middot; Before Netpbm 10.16 (June 2003),
-resolutionunit did not exist and the resolution unit was
always inches.</p>

<p>HISTORY pamtotiff was originally pnmtotiff and did not
handle PAM input. It was extended and renamed in Netpbm
10.30 (October 2005).</p>
