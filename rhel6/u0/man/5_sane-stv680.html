<p>sane-stv680(5) SANE Scanner Access Now Easy
sane-stv680(5)</p>

<p>NAME sane-stv680 - SANE backend for STV680 cameras</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sane-stv680 library implements a SANE
(Scanner Access Now Easy) backend that provides access to
some STV680 cameras. This backend should be considered
beta-quality software! STV680 cameras are sold under various
brands like Aiptek. This backend may or may not support
yours.</p>

<p>The cameras that should work with this backend are:</p>

<p>Vendor Model USB vendor id USB product id status
------------------------ ------------- --------------
-------- AIPTEK stv680 0x0553 0x0202 basic Konica e-mini
0x04c8 0x0722 untested DigitalDream l espion XS 0x1183
0x0001 untested Creative WebCam Go mini 0x041e 0x4007
untested</p>

<p>For all these cameras, see the backend home page (under
AUTHOR) for the exact status of each camera.</p>

<p>For startup of this backend check that if present the
stv680 kernel module is removed or disabled. Also before
using, enable the backend by editing the
/etc/sane.d/dll.conf file, change #stv680 to stv680.</p>

<p>For problems with the untested cameras, you should
contact the author for that.</p>

<p>The options the backend supports can either be selected
through command line options to programs like scanimage or
through GUI elements in xcam. For both programs use the -B
option needed for size buffer.</p>

<p>Some frontends examples: xcam xcam -B</p>

<p>scanimage: for writing in batch mode to a file or to a
new file each time. scanimage -B -d stv680:libusb:001:002
--batch=out.ppm --batch- count 5 --mode &quot;Color
RGB&quot; scanimage -B -d stv680:libusb:001:002
--batch=out%d.ppm --batch- count 5 --mode &quot;Color
RGB&quot;</p>

<p>If you have any success with a camera not listed here,
or if you have any strange behavior, please report to the
backend maintainer or to the SANE mailing list.</p>

<p>Valid command line options and their syntax can be
listed by using scanimage --help -d stv680</p>

<p>Scan Mode</p>

<p>--mode selects the basic mode of operation of the
webcams valid choices.</p>

<p>The read resolution mode is 8 bits, output resolution is
24 bits. Selects the resolution for a scan. The camera can
do only the resolutions listed.</p>

<p>--Raw In this mode raw data is displayed</p>

<p>--Color In this mode the bayer unshuffle is done but no
color correction</p>

<p>--Color_RGB Bayer unshuffle, color correction</p>

<p>--Color_RGB_TXT Bayer unshuffle, color correction,
textline with date and time is added</p>

<p>Enhancement options</p>

<p>--white-level-r Selects what red radiance level should
be considered &quot;white&quot;, when scanning some sheets
by changing the calibration value loaded into the scanner.
Scale -32 .. 0 .. +32 in steps of 1.</p>

<p>--white-level-g Selects what green radiance level should
be considered &quot;white&quot;, when scanning some sheets
by changing the calibration i value loaded into the scanner.
Scale -32 .. 0 .. +32 in steps of 1.</p>

<p>--white-level-b Selects what blue radiance level should
be considered &quot;white&quot;, when scanning some sheets
by changing the calibration value loaded into the scanner.
Scale -32 .. 0 .. +32 in steps of 1.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION FILE The configuration file
/etc/sane.d/stv680.conf supports only one infor- mation: the
device name to use (eg usb 0x.... 0x....).</p>

<p>FILES /usr/lib64/sane/libsane-stv680.a The static
library implementing this backend.</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-stv680.so The shared library
implementing this backend (present on systems that support
dynamic loading).</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT SANE_DEBUG_STV680 If the library was
compiled with debug support enabled, this environment
variable controls the debug level for this backend. E.g., a
value of 128 requests all debug output to be printed.
Smaller levels reduce verbosity.</p>

<p>LIMITATIONS The windows TWAIN driver has many more
options than this SANE backend. However they are only
software adjustments. This backend only imple- ments what
the webcam can support.</p>

<p>BUGS Plenty. Parts of this backend are still under
development. 1. Some untested cameras. 2. Video streaming
slow and stops sometimes (scanimage). 3. Sometimes 1/3 of
image is NOK (xcam).</p>
