<p>NAME ppmshift - shift lines of a PPM image left or right
by a random amount</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ppmshift shift [ppmfile]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>ppmshift reads a PPM image as input. Shifts every row of
image data to the left or right by a random amount, within a
range of shift pixels. The random distribution is uniform,
centered at zero movement.</p>

<p>The randomness in the image is limited before Netpbm
10.37 (December 2006) -- if you run the program twice in the
same second, you may get identical output.</p>

<p>This is another one of those effects I intended to use
for MPEG tests. Unfortunately, this program will not help me
here - it creates too ran- dom patterns to be used for
animations. Still, it might give interest- ing results on
still images.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE Check this out: Save your favourite models
picture from something like
alt.binaries.pictures.supermodels (ok, or from any other
picture source), convert it to ppm, and process it e.g. like
this, assuming the picture is 800x600 pixels:</p>

<p>#take the upper half, and leave it like it is pamcut
-top=0 -width=800 -height=300 cs.ppm &gt;upper.ppm</p>

<p>#take the lower half, flip it upside down, dim it and
distort it a little pamcut -top=300 -width=800 -height=300
cs.ppm | pamflip -topbottom | ppmdim 0.7 | ppmshift 10
&gt;lower.ppm</p>

<p>#and concatenate the two pieces pnmcat -topbottom
upper.ppm lower.ppm &gt;newpic.ppm</p>

<p>The resulting picture looks like the image being
reflected on a water surface with slight ripples.</p>
