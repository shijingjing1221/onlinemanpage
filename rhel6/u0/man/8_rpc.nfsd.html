<p>NAME rpc.nfsd - NFS server process</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS /usr/sbin/rpc.nfsd [options] nproc</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The rpc.nfsd program implements the user
level part of the NFS service. The main functionality is
handled by the nfsd kernel module. The user space program
merely specifies what sort of sockets the kernel service
should listen on, what NFS versions it should support, and
how many kernel threads it should use.</p>

<p>The rpc.mountd server provides an ancillary service
needed to satisfy mount requests by NFS clients.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -d or --debug enable logging of debugging
messages</p>

<p>-H or --host hostname specify a particular hostname (or
address) that NFS requests will be accepted on. By default,
rpc.nfsd will accept NFS requests on all known network
addresses. Note that lockd (which performs file locking
services for NFS) may still accept request on all known
network addresses. This may change in future releases of the
Linux Kernel.</p>

<p>-p or --port port specify a diferent port to listen on
for NFS requests. By default, rpc.nfsd will listen on port
2049.</p>

<p>-N or --no-nfs-version vers This option can be used to
request that rpc.nfsd does not offer certain versions of
NFS. The current version of rpc.nfsd can support both NFS
version 2,3 and the newer version 4.</p>

<p>-s or --syslog By default, rpc.nfsd logs error messages
(and debug messages, if enabled) to stderr. This option
makes rpc.nfsd log these mes- sages to syslog instead. Note
that errors encountered during option processing will still
be logged to stderr regardless of this option.</p>

<p>-T or --no-tcp Disable rpc.nfsd from accepting TCP
connections from clients.</p>

<p>-U or --no-udp Disable rpc.nfsd from accepting UDP
connections from clients.</p>

<p>nproc specify the number of NFS server threads. By
default, just one thread is started. However, for optimum
performance several threads should be used. The actual
figure depends on the number of and the work load created by
the NFS clients, but a useful starting point is 8 threads.
Effects of modifying that number can be checked using the
nfsstat(8) program.</p>

<p>Note that if the NFS server is already running, then the
options for specifying host, port, and protocol will be
ignored. The number of processes given will be the only
option considered, and the number of active nfsd processes
will be increased or decreased to match this num- ber. In
particular rpc.nfsd 0 will stop all threads and thus close
any open connections.</p>

<p>NOTES If the program is built with TI-RPC support, it
will enable any proto- col and address family combinations
that are marked visible in the net- config database.</p>
