<p>NAME pnmcolormap - create quantization color map for a
Netpbm image</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pnmcolormap</p>

<p>[-center|-meancolor|-meanpixel]</p>

<p>[-spreadbrightness|-spreadluminosity]</p>

<p>[-sort]</p>

<p>[-square]</p>

<p>ncolors|all</p>

<p>[pnmfile]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pnmcolormap reads a PNM or PAM image as input, chooses
ncolors colors to best represent the image and writes a PNM
color map defining them as output. A PAM image may actually
contain tuples of any kind, but pnm- colormap s concept of
the tuple values that best represent the ones present in the
image may not make sense if the tuple type isnt RGB or
GRAYSCALE. The design of the program, and the rest of this
manual, assumes the tuples represent colors.</p>

<p>You can use this map as input to pnmremap on the same
input image to quantize the colors in that image, I.e.
produce a similar image with fewer colors. pnmquant does
both the pnmcolormap and pnmremap steps for you.</p>

<p>A PNM colormap is a PNM image of any dimensions that
contains at least one pixel of each color in the set of
colors it represents. The ones pnmcolormap generates have
exactly one pixel of each color, except where padding is
necessary with the -square option.</p>

<p>The quantization method is Heckberts median cut. See
QUANTIZATION METHOD .</p>

<p>The output image is of the same format (PBM, PGM, PPM,
PAM) as the input image. Note that a colormap of a PBM image
is not very interest- ing.</p>

<p>The colormap generally has the same maxval as the input
image, but pnm- colormap may reduce it if there are too many
colors in the input, as part of its quantization
algorithm.</p>

<p>pnmcolormap works on a multi-image input stream. In that
case, it pro- duces one colormap that applies to all of the
colors in all of the input images. All the images must have
the same format, depth, and maxval (but may have different
height and width). This is useful if you need to quantize a
bunch of images that will form a movie or other- wise be
used together -- you generally want them all to draw from
the same palette, whereas computing a colormap separately
from each image would make the same color in two images map
to different colors. Before Netpbm 10.31 (December 2005),
pnmcolormap ignored any image after the first.</p>

<p>If you want to create a colormap without basing it on
the colors in an input image, pamseq, ppmmake, and pnmcat
can be useful.</p>

<p>PARAMETERS The single parameter, which is required, is
the number of colors you want in the output colormap.
pnmcolormap may produce a color map with slightly fewer
colors than that. You may specify all to get a colormap of
every color in the input image (no quantization).</p>

<p>OPTIONS All options can be abbreviated to their shortest
unique prefix. You may use two hyphens instead of one to
designate an option. You may use either white space or an
equals sign between an option name and its value.</p>

<p>-sort This option causes the output colormap to be
sorted by the red component intensity, then the green, then
the blue in ascending order. This is an insertion sort, so
it is not very fast on large colormaps. Sorting is useful
because it allows you to compare two sets of colors.</p>

<p>-square By default, pnmcolormap produces as the color
map a PPM image with one row and with one column for each
color in the colormap. This option causes pnmcolormap
instead to produce a PPM image that is within one row or
column of being square, with the last pixel duplicated as
necessary to create a number of pixels which is such an
almost-perfect square.</p>

<p>-verbose This option causes pnmcolormap to display
messages to Standard Error about the quantization..TP
-center</p>

<p>-meancolor</p>

<p>-meanpixel</p>

<p>-spreadbrightness</p>

<p>-spreadluminosity These options control the quantization
algorithm. See QUANTIZA- TION METHOD .</p>

<p>QUANTIZATION METHOD A quantization method is a way to
choose which colors, being fewer in number than in the
input, you want in the output. pnmcolormap uses Heckberts
median cut quantization method.</p>

<p>This method involves separating all the colors into
boxes, each hold- ing colors that represent about the same
number of pixels. You start with one box and split boxes in
two until the number of boxes is the same as the number of
colors you want in the output, and choose one color to
represent each box.</p>

<p>When you split a box, you do it so that all the colors
in one sub-box are greater than all the colors in the other.
Greater, for a par- ticular box, means it is brighter in the
color component (red, green, blue) which has the largest
spread in that box. pnmcolormap gives you two ways to define
largest spread.: 1) largest spread of brightness; 2) largest
spread of contribution to the luminosity of the color. E.g.
red is weighted much more than blue. Select among these with
the -spreadbrightness and -spreadluminosity options. The
default is -spreadbrightness.</p>

<p>pnmcolormap provides three ways of choosing a color to
represent a box: 1) the center color - the color halfway
between the greatest and least colors in the box, using the
above definition of greater; 2) the mean of the colors (each
component averaged separately by brightness) in the box; 3)
the mean weighted by the number of pixels of a color in the
image.</p>

<p>Note that in all three methods, there may be colors in
the output which do not appear in the input at all.</p>

<p>Select among these with the -center, -meancolor, and
-meanpixel options. The default is -center.</p>

<p>HISTORY Before Netpbm 10.15 (April 2003), pnmcolormap
used a lot more memory for large images because it kept the
entire input image in memory. Now, it processes it a row at
a time, but because it sometimes must make multiple passes
through the image, it first copies the input into a
temporary seekable file if it is not already in a seekable
file.</p>

<p>pnmcolormap first appeared in Netpbm 9.23 (January
2002). Before that, its function was available only as part
of the function of pnmquant (which was derived from the much
older ppmquant). Color quantization really has two main
subfunctions, so Netpbm 9.23 split it out into two separate
programs: pnmcolormap and pnmremap and then Netpbm 9.24
replaced pnmquant with a program that simply calls
pnmcolormap and pnm- remap.</p>
