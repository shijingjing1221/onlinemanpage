<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME lsearch - See if a list contains a particular
element</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS lsearch ?options? list pattern
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This command searches the elements of list
to see if one of them matches pattern. If so, the command
returns the index of the first matching element (unless the
options -all or -inline are specified.) If not, the command
returns -1. The option arguments indicates how the elements
of the list are to be matched against pattern and must have
one of the values below:</p>

<p>MATCHING STYLE OPTIONS If all matching style options are
omitted, the default matching style is -glob. If more than
one matching style is specified, the last matching style
given takes precedence.</p>

<p>-exact Pattern is a literal string that is compared for
exact equality against each list element.</p>

<p>-glob Pattern is a glob-style pattern which is matched
against each list element using the same rules as the string
match command.</p>

<p>-regexp Pattern is treated as a regular expression and
matched against each list element using the rules described
in the re_syntax reference page.</p>

<p>-sorted The list elements are in sorted order. If this
option is speci- fied, lsearch will use a more efficient
searching algorithm to search list. If no other options are
specified, list is assumed to be sorted in increasing order,
and to contain ASCII strings. This option is mutually
exclusive with -glob and -regexp, and is treated exactly
like -exact when either -all or -not are speci- fied.</p>

<p>GENERAL MODIFIER OPTIONS These options may be given with
all matching styles.</p>

<p>-all Changes the result to be the list of all matching
indices (or all matching values if -inline is specified as
well.) If indices are returned, the indices will be in
numeric order. If values are returned, the order of the
values will be the order of those values within the input
list.</p>

<p>-inline The matching value is returned instead of its
index (or an empty string if no value matches.) If -all is
also specified, then the result of the command is the list
of all values that matched.</p>

<p>-not This negates the sense of the match, returning the
index of the first non-matching value in the list.</p>

<p>-start index The list is searched starting at position
index. The interpre- tation of the index value is the same
as for the command string index, supporting simple index
arithmetic and indices relative to the end of the list.</p>

<p>CONTENTS DESCRIPTION OPTIONS These options describe how
to interpret the items in the list being searched. They are
only meaningful when used with the -exact and -sorted
options. If more than one is specified, the last one takes
precedence. The default is -ascii.</p>

<p>-ascii The list elements are to be examined as Unicode
strings (the name is for backward-compatibility
reasons.)</p>

<p>-dictionary The list elements are to be compared using
dictionary-style com- parisons (see lsort for a fuller
description). Note that this only makes a meaningful
difference from the -ascii option when the -sorted option is
given, because values are only dictionary- equal when
exactly equal.</p>

<p>-integer The list elements are to be compared as
integers.</p>

<p>-nocase Causes comparisons to be handled in a
case-insensitive manner. Has no effect if combined with the
-dictionary, -integer, or -real options.</p>

<p>-real The list elements are to be compared as
floating-point values.</p>

<p>SORTED LIST OPTIONS These options (only meaningful with
the -sorted option) specify how the list is sorted. If more
than one is given, the last one takes prece- dence. The
default option is -increasing.</p>

<p>-decreasing The list elements are sorted in decreasing
order. This option is only meaningful when used with
-sorted.</p>

<p>-increasing The list elements are sorted in increasing
order. This option is only meaningful when used with
-sorted.</p>

<p>NESTED LIST OPTIONS These options are used to search
lists of lists. They may be used with any other options.</p>

<p>-index indexList This option is designed for use when
searching within nested lists. The indexList argument gives
a path of indices (much as might be used with the lindex or
lset commands) within each ele- ment to allow the location
of the term being matched against.</p>

<p>-subindices If this option is given, the index result
from this command (or every index result when -all is also
specified) will be a com- plete path (suitable for use with
lindex or lset) within the overall list to the term found.
This option has no effect unless the -index is also
specified, and is just a convenience short-cut.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Basic searching: lsearch {a b c d e} c _2
lsearch -all {a b c a b c} c _2 5</p>

<p>Using lsearch to filter lists: lsearch -inline {a20 b35
c47} b* _b35 lsearch -inline -not {a20 b35 c47} b* _a20
lsearch -all -inline -not {a20 b35 c47} b* _a20 c47 lsearch
-all -not {a20 b35 c47} b* _0 2</p>

<p>This can even do a set-like removal operation: lsearch
-all -inline -not -exact {a b c a d e a f g a} a _b c d e f
g</p>

<p>Searching may start part-way through the list: lsearch
-start 3 {a b c a b c} c _5</p>

<p>It is also possible to search inside elements: lsearch
-index 1 -all -inline {{a abc} {b bcd} {c cde}} *bc* _{a
abc} {b bcd}</p>
