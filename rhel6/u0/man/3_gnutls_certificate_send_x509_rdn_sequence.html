<p>NAME gnutls_certificate_send_x509_rdn_sequence - order
gnutls to send or not the x.509 rdn sequence</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;gnutls/gnutls.h&gt;</p>

<p>void
gnutls_certificate_send_x509_rdn_sequence(gnutls_session_t
ses- sion, int status);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS gnutls_session_t session is a pointer to a
gnutls_session_t structure.</p>

<p>int status is 0 or 1</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION If status is non zero, this function will
order gnutls not to send the rdnSequence in the certificate
request message. That is the server will not advertize its
trusted CAs to the peer. If status is zero then the default
behaviour will take effect, which is to advertize the
servers trusted CAs.</p>

<p>This function has no effect in clients, and in
authentication methods other than certificate with X.509
certificates.</p>
