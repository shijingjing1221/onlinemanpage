<p>NAME XmTextCopyLink A Text function that copies a link
to the primary selection to the clipboard</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;Xm/Text.h&gt; Boolean
XmTextCopyLink( Widget widget, Time time);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION XmTextCopyLink copies a link to the primary
selected text to the clip- board. This routine calls the
XmNconvertCallback procedures, possibly multiple times, with
the selection member of the XmConvertCallback- Struct set to
CLIPBOARD and with the parm member set to XmLINK. The Text
widget itself does not copy any links; XmNconvertCallback
proce- dures are responsible for copying the link to the
clipboard and for taking any related actions.</p>

<p>widget Specifies the Text widget ID.</p>

<p>time Specifies the time of the transfer. This should be
the time of the event which triggered this request. One
source of a valid time stamp is the function
XtLastTimestampProcessed.</p>

<p>For a complete definition of Text and its associated
resources, see XmText(3).</p>

<p>RETURN This function returns False if the primary
selection is NULL, if the widget does not own the primary
selection, if the function is unable to gain ownership of
the clipboard selection, or if no data is placed on the
clipboard. Otherwise, it returns True.</p>
