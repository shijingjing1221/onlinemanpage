_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION A hash table consists of zero or more
entries, each consisting of a key and a value. Given the key
for an entry, the hashing routines can very quickly locate
the entry, and hence its value. There may be at most one
entry in a hash table with a particular key, but many
entries may have the same value. Keys can take one of four
forms: strings, one-word values, integer arrays, or custom
keys defined by a Tcl_HashKeyType structure (See section THE
TCL_HASHKEYTYPE STRUCTURE below). All of the keys in a given
table have the same form, which is specified when the table
is initialized.</p>

<p>The value of a hash table entry can be anything that
fits in the same space as a char * pointer. Values for hash
table entries are managed entirely by clients, not by the
hash module itself. Typically each entrys value is a pointer
to a data structure managed by client code.</p>

<p>Hash tables grow gracefully as the number of entries
increases, so that there are always less than three entries
per hash bucket, on average. This allows for fast lookups
regardless of the number of entries in a table.</p>

<p>The core provides three functions for the initialization
of hash tables, Tcl_InitHashTable, Tcl_InitObjHashTable and
Tcl_InitCus- tomHashTable.</p>

<p>Tcl_InitHashTable initializes a structure that describes
a new hash ta- ble. The space for the structure is provided
by the caller, not by the hash module. The value of keyType
indicates what kinds of keys will be used for all entries in
the table. All of the key types described later are allowed,
with the exception of TCL_CUSTOM_TYPE_KEYS and TCL_CUS-
TOM_PTR_KEYS.</p>

<p>Tcl_InitObjHashTable is a wrapper around
Tcl_InitCustomHashTable and initializes a hash table whose
keys are Tcl_Obj *.</p>

<p>Tcl_InitCustomHashTable initializes a structure that
describes a new hash table. The space for the structure is
provided by the caller, not by the hash module. The value of
keyType indicates what kinds of keys will be used for all
entries in the table. KeyType must have one of the following
values:</p>

<p>TCL_STRING_KEYS Keys are null-terminated strings. They
are passed to hashing routines using the address of the
first character of the string.</p>

<p>TCL_ONE_WORD_KEYS Keys are single-word values; they are
passed to hashing routines and stored in hash table entries
as char * values. The pointer value is the key; it need not
(and usually does not) actually point to a string.</p>

<p>TCL_CUSTOM_TYPE_KEYS Keys are of arbitrary type, and are
stored in the entry. Hashing and comparison is deter- mined
by typePtr. The Tcl_HashKeyType struc- ture is described in
the section THE TCL_HASHKEYTYPE STRUCTURE below.</p>

<p>TCL_CUSTOM_PTR_KEYS Keys are pointers to an arbitrary
type, and are stored in the entry. Hashing and compari- son
is determined by typePtr. The Tcl_HashKey- Type structure is
described in the section THE TCL_HASHKEYTYPE STRUCTURE
below.</p>

<p>other If keyType is not one of the above, then it must
be an integer value greater than 1. In this case the keys
will be arrays of int values, where keyType gives the number
of ints in each key. This allows structures to be used as
keys. All keys must have the same size. Array keys are
passed into hashing functions using the address of the first
int in the array.</p>

<p>Tcl_DeleteHashTable deletes all of the entries in a hash
table and frees up the memory associated with the tables
bucket array and entries. It does not free the actual table
structure (pointed to by tablePtr), since that memory is
assumed to be managed by the client. Tcl_DeleteHashTable
also does not free or otherwise manipulate the val- ues of
the hash table entries. If the entry values point to dynami-
cally-allocated memory, then it is the client s
responsibility to free these structures before deleting the
table.</p>

<p>Tcl_CreateHashEntry locates the entry corresponding to a
particular key, creating a new entry in the table if there
was not already one with the given key. If an entry already
existed with the given key then *newPtr is set to zero. If a
new entry was created, then *newPtr is set to a non-zero
value and the value of the new entry will be set to zero.
The return value from Tcl_CreateHashEntry is a pointer to
the entry, which may be used to retrieve and modify the
entrys value or to delete the entry from the table.</p>

<p>Tcl_DeleteHashEntry will remove an existing entry from a
table. The memory associated with the entry itself will be
freed, but the client is responsible for any cleanup
associated with the entrys value, such as freeing a
structure that it points to.</p>

<p>Tcl_FindHashEntry is similar to Tcl_CreateHashEntry
except that it does not create a new entry if the key doesn
t exist; instead, it returns NULL as result.</p>

<p>Tcl_GetHashValue and Tcl_SetHashValue are used to read
and write an entrys value, respectively. Values are stored
and retrieved as type ClientData, which is large enough to
hold a pointer value. On almost all machines this is large
enough to hold an integer value too.</p>

<p>Tcl_GetHashKey returns the key for a given hash table
entry, either as a pointer to a string, a one-word (char *)
key, or as a pointer to the first word of an array of
integers, depending on the keyType used to create a hash
table. In all cases Tcl_GetHashKey returns a result with
type char *. When the key is a string or array, the result
of Tcl_GetHashKey points to information in the table entry;
this informa- tion will remain valid until the entry is
deleted or its table is deleted.</p>

<p>Tcl_FirstHashEntry and Tcl_NextHashEntry may be used to
scan all of the entries in a hash table. A structure of type
Tcl_HashSearch, pro- vided by the client, is used to keep
track of progress through the ta- ble. Tcl_FirstHashEntry
initializes the search record and returns the first entry in
the table (or NULL if the table is empty). Each subse- quent
call to Tcl_NextHashEntry returns the next entry in the
table or NULL if the end of the table has been reached. A
call to Tcl_FirstHashEntry followed by calls to
Tcl_NextHashEntry will return each of the entries in the
table exactly once, in an arbitrary order. It is unadvisable
to modify the structure of the table, e.g. by creat- ing or
deleting entries, while the search is in progress, with the
exception of deleting the entry returned by
Tcl_FirstHashEntry or Tcl_NextHashEntry.</p>

<p>Tcl_HashStats returns a dynamically-allocated string
with overall information about a hash table, such as the
number of entries it con- tains, the number of buckets in
its hash array, and the utilization of the buckets. It is
the callers responsibility to free the result string by
passing it to ckfree.</p>

<p>The header file tcl.h defines the actual data structures
used to imple- ment hash tables. This is necessary so that
clients can allocate Tcl_HashTable structures and so that
macros can be used to read and write the values of entries.
However, users of the hashing routines should never refer
directly to any of the fields of any of the hash- related
data structures; use the procedures and macros defined
here.</p>

<p>THE TCL_HASHKEYTYPE STRUCTURE Extension writers can
define new hash key types by defining four proce- dures,
initializing a Tcl_HashKeyType structure to describe the
type, and calling Tcl_InitCustomHashTable. The
Tcl_HashKeyType structure is defined as follows: typedef
struct Tcl_HashKeyType { int version; int flags;
Tcl_HashKeyProc *hashKeyProc; Tcl_CompareHashKeysProc
*compareKeysProc; Tcl_AllocHashEntryProc *allocEntryProc;
Tcl_FreeHashEntryProc *freeEntryProc; } Tcl_HashKeyType;</p>

<p>The version member is the version of the table. If this
structure is extended in future then the version can be used
to distinguish between different structures. It should be
set to TCL_HASH_KEY_TYPE_VERSION.</p>

<p>The flags member is 0 or one or more of the following
values ORed together:</p>

<p>TCL_HASH_KEY_RANDOMIZE_HASH There are some things,
pointers for example which do not hash well because they do
not use the lower bits. If this flag is set then the hash
table will attempt to rectify this by randomizing the bits
and then using the upper N bits as the index into the
table.</p>

<p>TCL_HASH_KEY_SYSTEM_HASH This flag forces Tcl to use the
memory alloca- tion procedures provided by the operating
sys- tem when allocating and freeing memory used to store
the hash table data structures, and not any of Tcls own
customized memory allocation routines. This is important if
the hash table is to be used in the implementation of a
custom set of allocation routines, or some- thing that a
custom set of allocation routines might depend on, in order
to avoid any circu- lar dependency.</p>

<p>The hashKeyProc member contains the address of a
function called to calculate a hash value for the key.
typedef unsigned int (Tcl_HashKeyProc) ( Tcl_HashTable
*tablePtr, void *keyPtr); If this is NULL then keyPtr is
used and TCL_HASH_KEY_RANDOMIZE_HASH is assumed.</p>

<p>The compareKeysProc member contains the address of a
function called to compare two keys. typedef int
(Tcl_CompareHashKeysProc) ( void *keyPtr, Tcl_HashEntry
*hPtr); If this is NULL then the keyPtr pointers are
compared. If the keys do not match then the function returns
0, otherwise it returns 1.</p>

<p>The allocEntryProc member contains the address of a
function called to allocate space for an entry and
initialize the key and clientData. typedef Tcl_HashEntry
*(Tcl_AllocHashEntryProc) ( Tcl_HashTable *tablePtr, void
*keyPtr); If this is NULL then Tcl_Alloc is used to allocate
enough space for a Tcl_HashEntry, the key pointer is
assigned to key.oneWordValue and the clientData is set to
NULL. String keys and array keys use this function to
allocate enough space for the entry and the key in one
block, rather than doing it in two blocks. This saves space
for a pointer to the key from the entry and another memory
allocation. Tcl_Obj* keys use this function to allocate
enough space for an entry and increment the refer- ence
count on the object.</p>

<p>The freeEntryProc member contains the address of a
function called to free space for an entry. typedef void
(Tcl_FreeHashEntryProc) (Tcl_HashEntry *hPtr); If this is
NULL then Tcl_Free is used to free the space for the entry.
Tcl_Obj* keys use this function to decrement the reference
count on the object.</p>
