<p>NAME sssd_krb5_locator_plugin - the configuration file
for SSSD</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The Kerberos locator plugin
sssd_krb5_locator_plugin is used by the Kerberos provider of
sssd(8) to tell the Kerberos libraries what Realm and which
KDC to use. Typically this is done in krb5.conf(5) which is
always read by the Kerberos libraries. To simplyfy the
configuration the Realm and the KDC can be defined in
sssd.conf(5) as described in sssd-krb5.conf(5)</p>

<p>sssd(8) puts the Realm and the name or IP address of the
KDC into the enviroment variables SSSD_KRB5_REALM and
SSSD_KRB5_KDC respectively. When sssd_krb5_locator_plugin is
called by the kerberos libraries it reads and evaluates
these variable and returns them to the libraries.</p>

<p>NOTES Not all Kerberos implementations support the use
of plugins. If sssd_krb5_locator_plugin is not available on
your system you have to edit /etc/krb5.conf to reflect your
Kerberos setup.</p>

<p>If the enviroment variable SSSD_KRB5_LOCATOR_DEBUG is
set to any value debug messages will be sent to stderr.</p>
