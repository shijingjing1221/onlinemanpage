<p>MMAP2(2) Linux Programmer s Manual MMAP2(2)</p>

<p>NAME mmap2 - map files or devices into memory</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/mman.h&gt;</p>

<p>void *mmap2(void *addr, size_t length, int prot, int
flags, int fd, off_t pgoffset);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The mmap2() system call operates in exactly
the same way as mmap(2), except that the final argument
specifies the offset into the file in 4096-byte units
(instead of bytes, as is done by mmap(2)). This enables
applications that use a 32-bit off_t to map large files (up
to 2^44 bytes).</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, mmap2() returns a pointer to
the mapped area. On error -1 is returned and errno is set
appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS EFAULT Problem with getting the data from
userspace.</p>

<p>EINVAL (Various platforms where the page size is not
4096 bytes.) off- set * 4096 is not a multiple of the system
page size.</p>

<p>mmap2() can return any of the same errors as
mmap(2).</p>

<p>VERSIONS mmap2() is available since Linux 2.3.31.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO This system call is Linux-specific.</p>

<p>NOTES Nowadays, the glibc mmap() wrapper function
invokes this system call rather than the mmap(2) system
call.</p>

<p>On ia64, the unit for offset is actually the system page
size, rather than 4096 bytes.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO getpagesize(2), mmap(2), mremap(2), msync(2),
shm_open(3)</p>
