<p>NAME tbl - format tables for troff</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS tbl [ -Cv ] [ files... ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page describes the GNU version
of tbl, which is part of the groff document formatting
system. tbl compiles descriptions of tables embedded within
troff input files into commands that are understood by
troff. Normally, it should be invoked using the -t option of
groff. It is highly compatible with Unix tbl. The output
generated by GNU tbl cannot be processed with Unix troff; it
must be processed with GNU troff. If no files are given on
the command line, the standard input will be read. A
filename of - will cause the standard input to be read.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -C Recognize .TS and .TE even when followed by a
character other than space or newline.</p>

<p>-v Print the version number.</p>

<p>USAGE tbl expects to find table descriptions wrapped in
the .TS (table start) and .TE (table end) macros. The line
immediately following the .TS macro may contain any of the
following global options (ignoring the case of characters --
Unix tbl only accepts options with all characters lowercase
or all characters uppercase):</p>

<p>center Centers the table (default is left-justified).
The alternative keyword name centre is also recognized (this
is a GNU tbl exten- sion).</p>

<p>delim(xy) Use x and y as start and end delimiters for
eqn(1).</p>

<p>expand Makes the table as wide as the current line
length.</p>

<p>box Encloses the table in a box.</p>

<p>doublebox Encloses the table in a double box.</p>

<p>allbox Encloses each item of the table in a box.</p>

<p>frame Same as box (GNU tbl only).</p>

<p>doubleframe Same as doublebox (GNU tbl only).</p>

<p>tab(x) Uses the character x instead of a tab to separate
items in a line of input data.</p>

<p>linesize(n) Sets lines or rules (e.g. from box) in
n-point type.</p>

<p>nokeep Don t use diversions to prevent page breaks (GNU
tbl only). Normally tbl attempts to prevent undesirable
breaks in the table by using diversions. This can sometimes
interact badly with macro packages own use of diversions,
when footnotes, for exam- ple, are used.</p>

<p>decimalpoint(c) Set the character to be recognized as
the decimal point in numeric columns (GNU tbl only).</p>

<p>nospaces Ignore leading and trailing spaces in data
items (GNU tbl only).</p>

<p>The global options must end with a semicolon. There
might be whites- pace after an option and its argument in
parentheses.</p>

<p>After global options come lines describing the format of
each line of the table. Each such format line describes one
line of the table itself, except that the last format line
(which you must end with a period) describes all remaining
lines of the table. A single key char- acter describes each
column of each line of the table. You may run format specs
for multiple lines together on the same line by separating
them with commas.</p>

<p>You may follow each key character with specifiers that
determine the font and point size of the corresponding item,
that determine column width, inter-column spacing, etc.</p>

<p>The longest format line defines the number of columns in
the table; missing format descriptors at the end of format
lines are assumed to be L . Extra columns in the data (which
have no corresponding format entry) are ignored.</p>

<p>The available key characters are:</p>

<p>c,C Centers item within the column.</p>

<p>r,R Right-justifies item within the column.</p>

<p>l,L Left-justifies item within the column.</p>

<p>n,N Numerically justifies item in the column: Units
positions of numbers are aligned vertically.</p>

<p>s,S Spans previous item on the left into this
column.</p>

<p>a,A Centers longest line in this column and then
left-justifies all other lines in this column with respect
to that centered line.</p>

<p>^ Spans down entry from previous row in this column.</p>

<p>_,- Replaces this entry with a horizontal line.</p>

<p>= Replaces this entry with a double horizontal line.</p>

<p>| The corresponding column becomes a vertical rule (if
two of these are adjacent, a double vertical rule).</p>

<p>A vertical bar to the left of the first key-letter or to
the right of the last one produces a line at the edge of the
table.</p>

<p>Here are the specifiers that can appear in suffixes to
column key let- ters:</p>

<p>b,B Short form of fB (make affected entries bold).</p>

<p>i,I Short form of fI (make affected entries italic).</p>

<p>t,T Start an item vertically spanning rows at the top of
its range rather than vertically centering it.</p>

<p>d,D Start an item vertically spanning rows at the bottom
of its range rather than vertically centering it (GNU tbl
only).</p>

<p>v,V Followed by a number, this indicates the vertical
line spacing to be used in a multi-line table entry. If
signed, the current vertical line spacing is incremented or
decremented (using a signed number instead of a signed digit
is a GNU tbl extension). A vertical line spacing specifier
followed by a column separa- tion number must be separated
by one or more blanks. No effect if the corresponding table
entry isnt a text block.</p>

<p>f,F Either of these specifiers may be followed by a font
name (either one or two characters long), font number (a
single digit), or long name in parentheses (the last form is
a GNU tbl extension). A one-letter font name must be
separated by one or more blanks from whatever follows.</p>

<p>p,P Followed by a number, this does a point size change
for the affected fields. If signed, the current point size
is incre- mented or decremented (using a signed number
instead of a signed digit is a GNU tbl extension). A point
size specifier followed by a column separation number must
be separated by one or more blanks.</p>

<p>w,W Minimal column width value. Must be followed either
by a troff(1) width expression in parentheses or a unitless
integer. If no unit is given, en units are used. Also used
as the default line length for included text blocks. If used
multiple times, the last entry takes effect.</p>

<p>e,E Make equally-spaced columns.</p>

<p>u,U Move the corresponding column up one half-line.</p>

<p>z,Z Ignore the corresponding column for
width-calculation purposes.</p>

<p>A number suffix on a key character is interpreted as a
column separa- tion in ens (multiplied in proportion if the
expand option is on). Default separation is 3n.</p>

<p>The format lines are followed by lines containing the
actual data for the table, followed finally by .TE. Within
such data lines, items are normally separated by tab
characters (or the character specified with the tab option).
Long input lines can be broken across multiple lines if the
last character on the line is (which vanishes after concate-
nation).</p>

<p>A dot starting a line, followed by anything but a digit
is handled as a troff command, passed through without
changes. The table position is unchanged in this case.</p>

<p>If a data line consists of only _ or = , a single or
double line, respectively, is drawn across the table at that
point; if a single item in a data line consists of only _ or
=, then that item is replaced by a single or double line,
joining its neighbours. If a data item consists only of _ or
= , a single or double line, respectively, is drawn across
the field at that point which does not join its neigh-
bours.</p>

<p>A data item consisting only of ( x any character) is
replaced by repetitions of character x as wide as the column
(not joining its neighbours).</p>

<p>A data item consisting only of indicates that the field
immedi- ately above spans downward over this row.</p>

<p>A text block can be used to enter data as a single entry
which would be too long as a simple string between tabs. It
is started with T{ and closed with T}. The latter must start
a line, probably followed by other data columns (separated
with tabs).</p>

<p>To change the data format within a table, use the
.T&amp; command (at the start of a line). It is followed by
format and data lines (but no global options) similar to the
.TS request.</p>

<p>INTERACTION WITH EQN tbl(1) should always be called
before eqn(1) (groff(1) automatically takes care of the
correct order of preprocessors).</p>

<p>GNU TBL ENHANCEMENTS There is no limit on the number of
columns in a table, nor any limit on the number of text
blocks. All the lines of a table are considered in deciding
column widths, not just the first 200. Table continuation
(.T&amp;) lines are not restricted to the first 200
lines.</p>

<p>Numeric and alphabetic items may appear in the same
column.</p>

<p>Numeric and alphabetic items may span horizontally.</p>

<p>tbl uses register, string, macro and diversion names
beginning with the digit 3. When using tbl you should avoid
using any names beginning with a 3.</p>

<p>BUGS You should use .TS H/.TH in conjunction with a
supporting macro package for all multi-page boxed tables. If
there is no header that you wish to appear at the top of
each page of the table, place the .TH line immediately after
the format section. Do not enclose a multi-page ta- ble
within keep/release macros, or divert it in any other
way.</p>

<p>A text block within a table must be able to fit on one
page.</p>

<p>The bp request cannot be used to force a page-break in a
multi-page ta- ble. Instead, define BP as follows</p>

<p>.de BP .in(..bp$1 .e!.BP$1 ..</p>

<p>and use BP instead of bp.</p>

<p>Using directly in a table to get leaders will not work.
This is correct behaviour: is an uninterpreted leader. To
get leaders use a real leader, either by using a control A
or like this:</p>

<p>.ds a .TS tab(;); lw(1i) l. *a;B .TE</p>
