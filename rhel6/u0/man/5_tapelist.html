<p>NAME tapelist - The list of Amanda volumes in use</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The tapelist file contains the list of tapes
in active use. This file is not ordinarily ordinarily edited
or examined manually. Its format may change, or it may be
removed altogether, in future versions of Amanda. It
contains lines of the form:</p>

<p>YYYYMMDD label flags [#comment]</p>

<p>Where YYYYMMDD is the date the tape was written, label
is a label for the tape as written by amlabel and flags is
one of &quot;reuse&quot; or &quot;no-reuse&quot; and tells
Amanda whether the tape may be reused. A non-reusable tape
will not be overwritten, even if it is older than dumpcycle
dumps. See the reuse options of amadmin(8). The optional
comment is prefixed with a &acute;#&acute; and continues to
the end of the line. Amanda will maintain this comment until
the tape is overwritten. Note that comments are not allowed
on blank lines.</p>

<p>Amdump and amflush will by default refuse to write to an
unlabeled tape, or to a labeled tape that is considered
active or marked &quot;no-reuse&quot;. There must be more
tapes in active rotation (see the tapecycle option) than
there are runs in the backup cycle (see the dumpcycle
option) to prevent overwriting a backup image that would be
needed to do a full recovery.</p>
