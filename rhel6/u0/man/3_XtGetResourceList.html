<p>XtGetResourceList(3) XT FUNCTIONS
XtGetResourceList(3)</p>

<p>NAME XtGetResourceList, XtGetConstraintResourceList -
obtain resource list</p>

<p>SYNTAX void XtGetResourceList(WidgetClass class,
XtResourceList *resources_return, Cardinal
*num_resources_return);</p>

<p>void XtGetConstraintResourceList(WidgetClass class,
XtResourceList *resources_return, Cardinal
*num_resources_return);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS num_resources_return Specifies a pointer to
where to store the number of entries in the resource
list.</p>

<p>resources_return Specifies a pointer to where to store
the returned resource list. The caller must free this
storage using XtFree when done with it.</p>

<p>widget_class Specifies the widget class.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION If XtGetResourceList is called before the
widget class is initialized (that is, before the first
widget of that class has been created), XtGetResourceList
returns the resource list as specified in the widget class
record. If it is called after the widget class has been
initial- ized, XtGetResourceList returns a merged resource
list that contains the resources for all superclasses. The
list returned by XtGetResource- List should be freed using
XtFree when it is no longer needed.</p>

<p>If XtGetConstraintResourceList is called before the
widget class is initialized (that is, before the first
widget of that class has been created),
XtGetConstraintResourceList returns the resource list as
specified in the widget class Constraint part record. If it
is called after the widget class has been initialized,
XtGetConstraintResource- List returns a merged resource list
that contains the Constraint resources for all superclasses.
If the specified class is not a sub- class of
constraintWidgetClass, *resources_return is set to NULL and
*num_resources_return is set to zero. The list returned by
XtGet- ConstraintResourceList should be freed using XtFree
when it is no longer needed.</p>
