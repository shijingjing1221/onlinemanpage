<p>NAME groff_tmac - macro files in the roff typesetting
system</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The roff(7) type-setting system provides a
set of macro packages suit- able for special kinds of
documents. Each macro package stores its macros and
definitions in a file called the package s tmac file. The
name is deduced from TroffMACros.</p>

<p>The tmac files are normal roff source documents, except
that they usu- ally contain only definitions and setup
commands, but no text. All tmac files are kept in a single
or a small number of directories, the tmac directories.</p>

<p>GROFF MACRO PACKAGES groff provides all classical macro
packages, some more full packages, and some secondary
packages for special purposes.</p>

<p>Man Pages man This is the classical macro package for
UNIX manual pages (man pages); it is quite handy and easy to
use; see groff_man(7).</p>

<p>doc mdoc An alternative macro package for man pages
mainly used in BSD systems; it provides many new features,
but it is not the stan- dard for man pages; see
groff_mdoc(7).</p>

<p>Full Packages The packages in this section provide a
complete set of macros for writ- ing documents of any kind,
up to whole books. They are similar in functionality; it is
a matter of taste which one to use.</p>

<p>me The classical me macro package; see groff_me(7).</p>

<p>mm The semi-classical mm macro package; see
groff_mm(7).</p>

<p>mom The new mom macro package, only available in groff.
As this is not based on other packages, it can be freely
designed. So it is expected to become quite a nice, modern
macro package. See groff_mom(7).</p>

<p>ms The classical ms macro package; see groff_ms(7).</p>

<p>Special Packages The macro packages in this section are
not intended for stand-alone usage, but can be used to add
special functionality to any other macro package or to plain
groff.</p>

<p>tty-char Overrides the definition of standard troff
characters and some groff characters for tty devices. The
optical appearance is intentionally inferior compared to
that of normal tty formatting to allow processing with
critical equipment.</p>

<p>www Additions of elements known from the html format, as
being used in the internet (World Wide Web) pages; this
includes URL links and mail addresses; see groff_www(7).</p>

<p>NAMING In classical roff systems, there was a funny
naming scheme for macro packages, due to a simplistic design
in option parsing. Macro packages were always included by
option -m; when this option was directly fol- lowed by its
argument without an intervening space, this looked like a
long option preceded by a single minus a sensation in the
computer stone age. To make this optically working for macro
package names, all classical macro packages choose a name
that started with the letter m, which was omitted in the
naming of the macro file.</p>

<p>For example, the macro package for the man pages was
called man, while its macro file tmac.an. So it could be
activated by the argument an to option -m, or -man for
short.</p>

<p>For similar reasons, macro packages that did not start
with an m had a leading m added in the documentation and in
talking; for example, the package corresponding to tmac.doc
was called mdoc in the documenta- tion, although a more
suitable name would be doc. For, when omitting the space
between the option and its argument, the command line option
for activating this package reads -mdoc.</p>

<p>To cope with all situations, actual versions of groff(1)
are smart about both naming schemes by providing two macro
files for the inflicted macro packages; one with a leading
m, the other one without it. So in groff, the man macro
package may be specified as on of the following four
methods:</p>

<p>sh# groff -m man sh# groff -man sh# groff -mman sh#
groff -m an</p>

<p>Recent packages that do not start with m do not use an
additional m in the documentation. For example, the www
macro package may be speci- fied only as one of the two
methods:</p>

<p>sh# groff -m www sh# groff -mwww</p>

<p>Obviously, variants like -mmwww would not make much
sense.</p>

<p>A second strange feature of classical troff was to name
macro files ac- cording to tmac.name. In modern operating
systems, the type of a file is specified as postfix, the
file name extension. Again, groff copes with this situation
by searching both anything.tmac and tmac.anything if only
anything is specified.</p>

<p>The easiest way to find out which macro packages are
available on a system is to check the man page groff(1), or
the contents of the tmac directories.</p>

<p>In groff, most macro packages are described in man pages
called groff_name(7), with a leading m for the classical
packages.</p>

<p>INCLUSION There are several ways to use a macro package
in a document. The clas- sical way is to specify the
troff/groff option -m name at run-time; this makes the
contents of the macro package name available. In groff, the
file name.tmac is searched within the tmac path; if not
found, tmac.name will be searched for instead.</p>

<p>Alternatively, it is also possible to include a macro
file by adding the request .so filename into the document;
the argument must be the full file name of an existing file,
possibly with the directory where it is kept. In groff, this
was improved by the similar request .mso package, which
added searching in the tmac path, just like option -m
does.</p>

<p>Note that in order to resolve the .so and .mso requests,
the roff pre- processor soelim(1) must be called if the
files to be included need preprocessing. This can be done
either directly by a pipeline on the command line or by
using the troff/groff option -s. man calls soelim
automatically.</p>

<p>For example, suppose a macro file is stored as
/usr/share/groff/1.18.1.4/tmac/macros.tmac and is used in
some document called docu.roff.</p>

<p>At run-time, the formatter call for this is</p>

<p>sh# groff -m macrofile document.roff</p>

<p>To include the macro file directly in the document
either</p>

<p>.mso macrofile.tmac</p>

<p>is used or</p>

<p>.so /usr/share/groff/1.18.1.4/tmac/macros.tmac</p>

<p>In both cases, the formatter is called with</p>

<p>sh# troff -s docu.roff</p>

<p>If you want to write your own groff macro file, call it
whatever.tmac and put it in some directory of the tmac path,
see section FILES. Then documents can include it with the
.mso request or the option -m.</p>

<p>WRITING MACROS A roff(7) document is a text file that is
enriched by predefined for- matting constructs, such as
requests, escape sequences, strings, numer- ic registers,
and macros from a macro package. These elements are de-
scribed in roff(7).</p>

<p>To give a document a personal style, it is most useful
to extend the existing elements by defining some macros for
repeating tasks; the best place for this is near the
beginning of the document or in a separate file.</p>

<p>Macros without arguments are just like strings. But the
full power of macros reveals when arguments are passed with
a macro call. Within the macro definition, the arguments are
available as the escape sequences $1, ..., $9, $[...], $*,
and $@, the name under which the macro was called is in $0,
and the number of arguments is in register 0; see
groff(7).</p>

<p>Copy-in Mode The phase when groff reads a macro is
called copy-in mode in roff-talk. This is comparable to the
C preprocessing phase during the development of a program
written in the C language.</p>

<p>In this phase, groff interprets all backslashes; that
means that all escape sequences in the macro body are
interpreted and replaced by their value. For constant
expression, this is wanted, but strings and registers that
might change between calls of the macro must be protect- ed
from being evaluated. This is most easily done by doubling
the backslash that introduces the escape sequence. This
doubling is most important for the positional parameters.
For example, to print infor- mation on the arguments that
were passed to the macro to the terminal, define a macro
named .print_args, say.</p>

<p>.ds midpart was called with .de print_args . tm
<i>\$0</i> \*[midpart] \n[.$] arguments: . tm \$* ..</p>

<p>When calling this macro by</p>

<p>.print_args arg1 arg2</p>

<p>the following text is printed to the terminal:
print_args was called with the following 2 arguments: arg1
arg2</p>

<p>Let s analyze each backslash in the macro definition. As
the position- al parameters and the number of arguments will
change with each call of the macro their leading backslash
must be doubled, which results in $* and [.$]. The same
applies to the macro name because it could be called with an
alias name, so $0.</p>

<p>On the other hand, midpart is a constant string, it will
not change, so no doubling for *[midpart]. The f escape
sequences are predefined groff elements for setting the font
within the text. Of course, this behavior will not change,
so no doubling with f[I] and f[].</p>

<p>Draft Mode Writing groff macros is easy when the
escaping mechanism is temporarily disabled. In groff, this
is done by enclosing the macro definition(s) into a pair of
.eo and .ec requests. Then the body in the macro defi-
nition is just like a normal part of the document text
enhanced by calls of requests, macros, strings, registers,
etc. For example, the code above can be written in a simpler
way by</p>

<p>.eo .ds midpart was called with .de print_args . tm 0
arguments: . tm .. .ec</p>

<p>Unfortunately, draft mode cannot be used universally.
Although it is good enough for defining normal macros, draft
mode will fail with ad- vanced applications, such as
indirectly defined strings, registers, etc. An optimal way
is to define and test all macros in draft mode and then do
the backslash doubling as a final step; do not forget to
remove the .eo request.</p>

<p>Tips for Macro Definitions &middot; Start every line
with a dot, for example, by using the groff request .nop for
text lines, or write your own macro that handles also text
lines with a leading dot.</p>

<p>.de Text . if (\n[.$] == 0) . return . nop \$*[rs]
..</p>

<p>&middot; Write a comment macro that works both for
copy-in and draft mode; for as escaping is off in draft
mode, trouble might occur when normal comments are used. For
example, the following macro just ignores its arguments, so
it acts like a comment line:</p>

<p>.de c .. .c This is like a comment line.</p>

<p>&middot; In long macro definitions, make ample use of
comment lines or empty lines for a better structuring.</p>

<p>&middot; To increase readability, use groff s
indentation facility for re- quests and macro calls
(arbitrary whitespace after the leading dot).</p>

<p>Diversions Diversions can be used to realize quite
advanced programming con- structs. They are comparable to
pointers to large data structures in the C programming
language, but their usage is quite different.</p>

<p>In their simplest form, diversions are multi-line
strings, but they get their power when diversions are used
dynamically within macros. The information stored in a
diversion can be retrieved by calling the di- version just
like a macro.</p>

<p>Most of the problems arising with diversions can be
avoided if you are conscious about the fact that diversions
always deal with complete lines. If diversions are used when
the line buffer has not been flashed, strange results are
produced; not knowing this, many people get desperate about
diversions. To ensure that a diversion works, line breaks
should be added at the right places. To be on the secure
side, enclose everything that has to do with diversions into
a pair of line breaks; for example, by amply using .br
requests. This rule should be applied to diversion
definition, both inside and outside, and to all calls of
diversions. This is a bit of overkill, but it works
nicely.</p>

<p>[If you really need diversions which should ignore the
current partial line, use environments to save the current
partial line and/or use the .box request.]</p>

<p>The most powerful feature using diversions is to start a
diversion within a macro definition and end it within
another macro. Then every- thing between each call of this
macro pair is stored within the diver- sion and can be
manipulated from within the macros.</p>

<p>FILES All macro names must be named name.tmac to fully
use the tmac mecha- nism. tmac.name as with classical
packages is possible as well, but deprecated.</p>

<p>The macro files are kept in the tmac directories; a
colon separated list of these constitutes the tmac path.</p>

<p>The search sequence for macro files is (in that
order):</p>

<p>&middot; the directories specified with troff/groffs -M
command line option</p>

<p>&middot; the directories given in the $GROFF_TMAC_PATH
environment variable</p>

<p>&middot; the current directory (only if in unsafe mode,
which is enabled by the -U command line switch)</p>

<p>&middot; the home directory</p>

<p>&middot; a platform-specific directory, being
/usr/lib64/groff/site-tmac in this installation</p>

<p>&middot; a site-specific (platform-independent)
directory, being /usr/share/groff/site-tmac in this
installation</p>

<p>&middot; the main tmac directory, being
/usr/share/groff/1.18.1.4/tmac in this installation</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT $GROFF_TMAC_PATH A colon separated list of
additional tmac directories in which to search for macro
files. See the previous section for a de- tailed
description.</p>
