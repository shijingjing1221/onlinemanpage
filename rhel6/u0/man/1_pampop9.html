<p>NAME pampop9 - simulate a multi-lens camera such as the
Pop9</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pampop9 pnmfile|- xtiles ytiles xdelta
ydelta</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pampop9 tiles your starting image xtiles by ytiles
times. Each of these tiles is taken from a slightly
different offset within the source, as determined by the
xdelta and ydelta arguments.</p>

<p>The top line of tiles in the output is taken from the
top of the source image, the second starts with the ydelta
row of the source image, the next with the 2*ydelta row, and
so on. Similarly, the first column of tiles in the output is
taken from the left of the source image, the next starts
with the xdelta column, the next with the 2*xdelta column,
and so on.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES With a 100 x 100 source image, then the output
image from pampop9 3 3 10 10 will appear to be a
three-by-three grid, each tile being 80 x 80 pixels. If the
origin is taken to be the top-left corner, then the top row
of tiles will take start at (0, 0) (10, 0) (20, 0) within
the source image, the middle row will start at (0, 10) (10,
10) (20, 10), and the bottom row at (0, 20) (10, 20) (20,
20).</p>

<p>HISTORY pampop9 was new in Netpbm 10.15 (April 2003). It
was adapted slightly from pampup9, which was distributed by
Robert Tinsley. At that time, it was distributed via
http://www.thepoacher.net/code/#pampup9. By October 2004,
that URL no longer was valid.</p>
