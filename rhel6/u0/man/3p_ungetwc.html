<p>UNGETWC(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual UNGETWC(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME ungetwc - push wide-character code back into the
input stream</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdio.h&gt; #include
&lt;wchar.h&gt;</p>

<p>wint_t ungetwc(wint_t wc, FILE *stream);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The ungetwc() function shall push the
character corresponding to the wide-character code specified
by wc back onto the input stream pointed to by stream. The
pushed-back characters shall be returned by subse- quent
reads on that stream in the reverse order of their pushing.
A successful intervening call (with the stream pointed to by
stream) to a file-positioning function ( fseek(), fsetpos(),
or rewind()) discards any pushed-back characters for the
stream. The external storage corre- sponding to the stream
is unchanged.</p>

<p>At least one character of push-back shall be provided.
If ungetwc() is called too many times on the same stream
without an intervening read or file-positioning operation on
that stream, the operation may fail.</p>

<p>If the value of wc equals that of the macro WEOF, the
operation shall fail and the input stream shall be left
unchanged.</p>

<p>A successful call to ungetwc() shall clear the
end-of-file indicator for the stream. The value of the
file-position indicator for the stream after reading or
discarding all pushed-back characters shall be the same as
it was before the characters were pushed back. The
file-posi- tion indicator is decremented (by one or more) by
each successful call to ungetwc(); if its value was 0 before
a call, its value is unspeci- fied after the call.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, ungetwc() shall
return the wide-character code corresponding to the
pushed-back character. Otherwise, it shall return WEOF.</p>

<p>ERRORS The ungetwc() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EILSEQ An invalid character sequence is detected, or a
wide-character code does not correspond to a valid
character.</p>
