<p>WINBIND_KRB5_LOCATOR(7) 7 WINBIND_KRB5_LOCATOR(7)</p>

<p>NAME winbind_krb5_locator - A plugin for MIT and Heimdal
Kerberos for detecting KDCs using Windows semantics.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This plugin is part of the samba(7)
suite.</p>

<p>winbind_krb5_locator is a plugin that permits MIT and
Heimdal Kerberos libraries to detect Kerberos Servers (for
the KDC and kpasswd service) using the same semantics that
other tools of the Samba suite use. This include site-aware
DNS service record lookups and caching of closest dc. The
plugin uses the public locator API provided by most modern
Kerberos implementations.</p>

<p>PREREQUISITES MIT Kerberos (at least version 1.5) or
Heimdal Kerberos (at least version 1.0) is required.</p>

<p>The plugin queries the winbindd(8) daemon which needs to
be configured and started separately.</p>

<p>The winbind_krb5_locator.so file needs to be manually
copied to the plugin directory of the system Kerberos
library. For MIT Kerberos this is often:
/usr/lib/krb5/plugins/libkrb5/. For Heimdal Kerberos this is
often: /usr/lib/plugin/krb5/. Please check your local
Kerberos installation for the correct paths. No modification
in /etc/krb5.conf is required to enable the use of this
plugin.</p>

<p>After copying the locator plugin to the appropriate
plugin directory it should immediately be available for use.
Users should be able to kinit into their kerberized Windows
environment without any modification or servers being put
manually into /etc/krb5.conf.</p>

<p>VERSION This man page is correct for version 3 of the
Samba suite.</p>

<p>AUTHOR The original Samba software and related utilities
were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by
the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way
the Linux kernel is developed.</p>

<p>The winbind_krb5_locator manpage was written by Guenther
Deschner.</p>
