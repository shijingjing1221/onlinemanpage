<p>rtcwake(8) Linux Programmer s Manual rtcwake(8)</p>

<p>NAME rtcwake - enter a system sleep state until
specified wakeup time</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rtcwake [-hvVlua] [-d device] [-m standby_mode]
{-t time_t|-s seconds}</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is used to enter a system sleep
state until specified wakeup time.</p>

<p>This uses cross-platform Linux interfaces to enter a
system sleep state, and leave it no later than a specified
time. It uses any RTC framework driver that supports
standard driver model wakeup flags.</p>

<p>This is normally used like the old apmsleep utility, to
wake from a suspend state like ACPI S1 (standby) or S3
(suspend-to-RAM). Most platforms can implement those without
analogues of BIOS, APM, or ACPI.</p>

<p>On some systems, this can also be used like
nvram-wakeup, waking from states like ACPI S4 (suspend to
disk). Not all systems have persistent media that are
appropriate for such suspend modes.</p>

<p>Options -v | --verbose Be verbose.</p>

<p>-h | --help Display a short help message that shows how
to use the program.</p>

<p>-V | --version Displays version information and
exists.</p>

<p>-a | --auto Reads the clock mode (whether the hardware
clock is set to UTC or local time) from /etc/adjtime. That s
the location where the hwclock(8) stores that
information.</p>

<p>-l | --local Assumes that the hardware clock is set to
local time, regardless of the contents of /etc/adjtime.</p>

<p>-u | --utc Assumes that the hardware clock is set to UTC
(Universal Time Coordinated), regardless of the contents of
/etc/adjtime.</p>

<p>-d device | --device device Uses device instead of rtc0
as realtime clock. This option is only relevant if your
system has more than one RTC. You may specify rtc1, rtc2,
... here.</p>

<p>-s seconds | --seconds seconds Sets the wakeup time to
seconds in future from now.</p>

<p>-t time_t | --time time_t Sets the wakeup time to the
absolute time time_t. time_t is the time in seconds since
1970-01-01, 00:00 UTC. Use the date(1) tool to convert
between human-readable time and time_t.</p>

<p>-m mode | --mode mode Use standby state mode. Valid
values are:</p>

<p>standby ACPI state S1. This state offers minimal, though
real, power savings, while providing a very low-latency
transition back to a working system. This is the default
mode.</p>

<p>mem ACPI state S3 (Suspend-to-RAM). This state offers
signif- icant power savings as everything in the system is
put into a low-power state, except for memory, which is
placed in self-refresh mode to retain its contents.</p>

<p>disk ACPI state S4 (Suspend-to-disk). This state offers
the greatest power savings, and can be used even in the
absence of low-level platform support for power manage-
ment. This state operates similarly to Suspend-to-RAM, but
includes a final step of writing memory contents to
disk.</p>

<p>off ACPI state S5 (Poweroff). This is done by calling
/sbin/shutdown. Not officially supported by ACPI, but
usually working.</p>

<p>no Dont suspend. The rtcwake command sets RTC wakeup
time only.</p>

<p>on Dont suspend, but read RTC device until alarm time
appears. This mode is useful for debugging.</p>

<p>NOTES Some PC systems cant currently exit sleep states
such as mem using only the kernel code accessed by this
driver. They need help from userspace code to make the
framebuffer work again.</p>

<p>HISTORY The program was posted several times on LKML and
other lists before appearing in kernel commit message for
Linux 2.6 in the GIT commit
87ac84f42a7a580d0dd72ae31d6a5eb4bfe04c6d.</p>

<p>AVAILABILITY The rtcwake command is part of the
util-linux-ng package and is avail- able from
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux-ng/.</p>

<p>AUTHOR The program was written by David Brownell
&lt;dbrownell@users.source- forge.net&gt; and improved by
Bernhard Walle &lt;bwalle@suse.de&gt;.</p>
