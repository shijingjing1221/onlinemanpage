gnutls_priority_init(3)</p>

<p>NAME gnutls_priority_init - Sets priorities for the
cipher suites supported by gnutls.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;gnutls/gnutls.h&gt;</p>

<p>int gnutls_priority_init(gnutls_priority_t *
priority_cache, const char * priorities, const char **
err_pos);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS gnutls_priority_t * priority_cache is a
gnutls_prioritity_t structure.</p>

<p>const char * priorities is a string describing
priorities</p>

<p>const char ** err_pos In case of an error this will have
the position in the string the error occured</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Sets priorities for the ciphers, key
exchange methods, macs and com- pression methods. This is to
avoid using the gnutls_*_priority() func- tions.</p>

<p>The priorities option allows you to specify a semi-colon
separated list of the cipher priorities to enable.</p>

<p>Unless the first keyword is &quot;NONE&quot; the
defaults (in preference order) are for TLS protocols TLS1.1,
TLS1.0, SSL3.0; for compression NULL; for certificate types
X.509, OpenPGP.</p>

<p>For key exchange algorithms when in NORMAL or SECURE
levels the perfect forward secrecy algorithms take
precendence of the other protocols. In all cases all the
supported key exchange algorithms are enabled (except for
the RSA-EXPORT which is only enabled in EXPORT level).</p>

<p>Note that although one can select very long key sizes
(such as 256 bits) for symmetric algorithms, to actually
increase security the pub- lic key algorithms have to use
longer key sizes as well.</p>

<p>For all the current available algorithms and protocols
use &quot;gnutls-cli -l&quot; to get a listing.</p>

<p>COMMON KEYWORDS Some keywords are defined to provide
quick access to common prefer- ences.</p>

<p>&quot;PERFORMANCE&quot; means all the &quot;secure&quot;
ciphersuites are enabled, limited to 128 bit ciphers and
sorted by terms of speed performance.</p>

<p>&quot;NORMAL&quot; means all &quot;secure&quot;
ciphersuites. The 256-bit ciphers are included as a fallback
only. The ciphers are sorted by security mar- gin.</p>

<p>&quot;SECURE128&quot; means all &quot;secure&quot;
ciphersuites with ciphers up to 128 bits, sorted by security
margin.</p>

<p>&quot;SECURE256&quot; means all &quot;secure&quot;
ciphersuites including the 256 bit ciphers, sorted by
security margin.</p>

<p>&quot;EXPORT&quot; means all ciphersuites are enabled,
including the low-security 40 bit ciphers.</p>

<p>&quot;NONE&quot; means nothing is enabled. This disables
even protocols and com- pression methods.</p>

<p>SPECIAL KEYWORDS &quot;!&quot; or &quot;-&quot; appended
with an algorithm will remove this algorithm.</p>

<p>&quot;+&quot; appended with an algorithm will add this
algorithm.</p>

<p>&quot;%COMPAT&quot; will enable compatibility features
for a server.</p>

<p>&quot;%UNSAFE_RENEGOTIATION&quot; will allow unsafe
renegotiation (this is now the default for clients, but will
change once more servers support the safe renegotiation TLS
fix).</p>

<p>&quot;%SAFE_RENEGOTIATION&quot; will allow safe
renegotiation only (this is the default for servers - that
will reject clients trying to perform an unsafe
renegotiation).</p>

<p>&quot;%INITIAL_SAFE_RENEGOTIATION&quot; will force
initial safe negotiation even if renegotiation wasn t
requested. Only valid for server side and implies
&quot;%SAFE_RENEGOTIATION&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;%DISABLE_SAFE_RENEGOTIATION&quot; will disable
safe renegotiation com- pletely. Do not use unless you know
what you are doing. Testing pur- poses only.</p>

<p>&quot;%SSL3_RECORD_VERSION&quot; will use SSL3.0 record
version in client hello.</p>

<p>&quot;%VERIFY_ALLOW_SIGN_RSA_MD5&quot; will allow
RSA-MD5 signatures in certifi- cate chains.</p>

<p>&quot;%VERIFY_ALLOW_X509_V1_CA_CRT&quot; will allow V1
CAs in chains.</p>

<p>NAMESPACE CONCERN To avoid collisions in order to
specify a compression algorithm in this string you have to
prefix it with &quot;COMP-&quot;, protocol versions with
&quot;VERS-&quot; and certificate types with
&quot;CTYPE-&quot;. All other algorithms dont need a
prefix.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES &quot;NORMAL:!AES-128-CBC&quot; means normal
ciphers except for AES-128.</p>

<p>&quot;EXPORT:!VERS-TLS1.0:+COMP-DEFLATE&quot; means that
export ciphers are enabled, TLS 1.0 is disabled, and libz
compression enabled.</p>


<p>&quot;NONE:+VERS-TLS1.0:+AES-128-CBC:+RSA:+SHA1:+COMP-NULL&quot;,
&quot;NORMAL&quot;, &quot;%COMPAT&quot;.</p>

<p>RETURNS On syntax error GNUTLS_E_INVALID_REQUEST is
returned, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS on success, or an error code.</p>
