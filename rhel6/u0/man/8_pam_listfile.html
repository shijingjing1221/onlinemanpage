<p>PAM_LISTFILE(8) Linux-PAM Manual PAM_LISTFILE(8)</p>

<p>NAME pam_listfile - deny or allow services based on an
arbitrary file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pam_listfile.so
item=[tty|user|rhost|ruser|group|shell] sense=[allow|deny]
file=/path/filename onerr=[succeed|fail]
[apply=[user|@group]] [quiet]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pam_listfile is a PAM module which provides
a way to deny or allow services based on an arbitrary
file.</p>

<p>The module gets the item of the type specified -- user
specifies the username, PAM_USER; tty specifies the name of
the terminal over which the request has been made, PAM_TTY;
rhost specifies the name of the remote host (if any) from
which the request was made, PAM_RHOST; and ruser specifies
the name of the remote user (if available) who made the
request, PAM_RUSER -- and looks for an instance of that item
in the file=filename. filename contains one line per item
listed. If the item is found, then if sense=allow,
PAM_SUCCESS is returned, causing the authorization request
to succeed; else if sense=deny, PAM_AUTH_ERR is returned,
causing the authorization request to fail.</p>

<p>If an error is encountered (for instance, if filename
does not exist, or a poorly-constructed argument is
encountered), then if onerr=succeed, PAM_SUCCESS is
returned, otherwise if onerr=fail, PAM_AUTH_ERR or
PAM_SERVICE_ERR (as appropriate) will be returned.</p>

<p>An additional argument, apply=, can be used to restrict
the application of the above to a specific user
(apply=username) or a given group (apply=@groupname). This
added restriction is only meaningful when used with the tty,
rhost and shell items.</p>

<p>Besides this last one, all arguments should be
specified; do not count on any default behavior.</p>

<p>No credentials are awarded by this module.</p>

<p>OPTIONS item=[tty|user|rhost|ruser|group|shell] What is
listed in the file and should be checked for.</p>

<p>sense=[allow|deny] Action to take if found in file, if
the item is NOT found in the file, then the opposite action
is requested.</p>

<p>file=/path/filename File containing one item per line.
The file needs to be a plain file and not world
writable.</p>

<p>onerr=[succeed|fail] What to do if something weird
happens like being unable to open the file.</p>

<p>apply=[user|@group] Restrict the user class for which
the restriction apply. Note that with
item=[user|ruser|group] this does not make sense, but for
item=[tty|rhost|shell] it have a meaning.</p>

<p>quiet Do not treat service refusals or missing list
files as errors that need to be logged.</p>

<p>MODULE TYPES PROVIDED All module types (auth, account,
password and session) are provided.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUES PAM_AUTH_ERR Authentication failure.</p>

<p>PAM_BUF_ERR Memory buffer error.</p>

<p>PAM_IGNORE The rule does not apply to the apply
option.</p>

<p>PAM_SERVICE_ERR Error in service module.</p>

<p>PAM_SUCCESS Success.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Classic &acute;ftpusers&acute; authentication
can be implemented with this entry in /etc/pam.d/ftpd:</p>

<p># # deny ftp-access to users listed in the /etc/ftpusers
file # auth required pam_listfile.so onerr=succeed item=user
sense=deny file=/etc/ftpusers</p>

<p>Note, users listed in /etc/ftpusers file are
(counterintuitively) not allowed access to the ftp
service.</p>

<p>To allow login access only for certain users, you can
use a /etc/pam.d/login entry like this:</p>

<p># # permit login to users listed in /etc/loginusers #
auth required pam_listfile.so onerr=fail item=user
sense=allow file=/etc/loginusers</p>

<p>For this example to work, all users who are allowed to
use the login service should be listed in the file
/etc/loginusers. Unless you are explicitly trying to lock
out root, make sure that when you do this, you leave a way
for root to log in, either by listing root in
/etc/loginusers, or by listing a user who is able to su to
the root account.</p>
