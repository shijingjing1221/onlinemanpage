<p>NAME sasl_getopt_t - The SASL get option callback</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sasl/sasl.h&gt;</p>

<p>int sasl_getopt_t(void *context, const char
*plugin_name, const char *option, const char ** result,
unsigned * len);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION sasl_getopt_t is used to retrieve an option,
often mechanism specific, from the application. An example
of this is requested what KERBEROS_V4 srvtab file to use.
plugin_name is the plugin this value if for. option is a
string representing the option. A common option that all
server applications should handle is method for checking
plaintext passwords. See the administrators guide for a full
description of this option.</p>

<p>Memory management of options supplied by the getopt
callback should be done by the application, however, any
requested option must remain available until the callback is
no longer valid. That is, when sasl_dispose is called for a
the connection it is associated with, or sasl_done is called
for global callbacks.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE SASL callback functions should return SASL
return codes. See sasl.h for a complete list. SASL_OK
indicates success.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO RFC 2222</p>
