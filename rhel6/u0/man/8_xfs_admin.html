<p>NAME xfs_admin - change parameters of an XFS
filesystem</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS xfs_admin [ -eflu ] [ -c 0|1 ] [ -L label ] [
-U uuid ] device</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION xfs_admin uses the xfs_db(8) command to
modify various parameters of a filesystem.</p>

<p>Devices that are mounted cannot be modified.
Administrators must unmount filesystems before xfs_admin or
xfs_db(8) can convert parame- ters. A number of parameters
of a mounted filesystem can be examined and modified using
the xfs_growfs(8) command.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -e Enables unwritten extent support on a
filesystem that does not already have this enabled (for
legacy filesystems, it cant be disabled anymore at mkfs
time).</p>

<p>-f Specifies that the filesystem image to be processed
is stored in a regular file at device (see the mkfs.xfs -d
file option).</p>

<p>-j Enables version 2 log format (journal format
supporting larger log buffers).</p>

<p>-l Print the current filesystem label.</p>

<p>-u Print the current filesystem UUID (Universally Unique
IDenti- fier).</p>

<p>-c 0|1 Enable (1) or disable (0) lazy-counters in the
filesystem. This operation may take quite a bit of time on
large filesystems as the entire filesystem needs to be
scanned when this option is changed.</p>

<p>With lazy-counters enabled, the superblock is not
modified or logged on every change of the free-space and
inode counters. Instead, enough information is kept in other
parts of the filesystem to be able to maintain the counter
values without needing to keep them in the superblock. This
gives significant improvements in performance on some
configurations and metadata intensive workloads.</p>

<p>-L label Set the filesystem label to label. XFS
filesystem labels can be at most 12 characters long; if
label is longer than 12 charac- ters, xfs_admin will
truncate it and print a warning message. The filesystem
label can be cleared using the special &quot;--&quot; value
for label.</p>

<p>-U uuid Set the UUID of the filesystem to uuid. A sample
UUID looks like this:
&quot;c1b9d5a2-f162-11cf-9ece-0020afc76f16&quot;. The uuid
may also be nil, which will set the filesystem UUID to the
null UUID. The uuid may also be generate, which will
generate a new UUID for the filesystem.</p>

<p>The mount(8) manual entry describes how to mount a
filesystem using its label or UUID, rather than its block
special device name.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO mkfs.xfs(8), mount(8), xfs_db(8),
xfs_growfs(8), xfs_repair(8), xfs(5).</p>
