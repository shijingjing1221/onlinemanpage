<p>NAME loaderinfo - report SCSI tape device info</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS loaderinfo -f &lt;scsi-generic-device&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The loaderinfo command reads various
information from SCSI tape load- ers. Its intended use is
for high-level programs that are trying to decide what the
capabilities of a device are.</p>

<p>The following are printed:</p>

<p>Element Address Assignment Page: This tells how many
elements are in the loader, and what their raw hardware
addresses are.</p>

<p>Transport Geometry Descriptor Page: Will display whether
media is invertible or not (usable with some optical
jukeboxes for detirmining whether to &quot;flip&quot; media
after writing to the first side).</p>

<p>Device Capabilities Page Currently will only display
whether we can transfer between slots (i.e. whether mtx
transfer works).</p>

<p>Inquiry Page Aside from the normal inquiry info, will
also print out whether we have a bar code reader (for
loaders that support the Exabyte extension for reporting
presense of said reader).</p>

<p>OPTIONS The first argument, given following -f , is the
SCSI generic device corresponding to your tape loader.
Consult your operating systems documentation for more
information (for example, under Linux these are generally
start at /dev/sg0 under FreeBSD these start at
/dev/pass0).</p>

<p>Under FreeBSD, camcontrol devlist will tell you what
SCSI devices you have, along with which pass device controls
them. Under Linux, &quot;cat /proc/scsi/scsi&quot; will tell
you what SCSI devices you have. Under Solaris 8, find
/devices -name *changer* will display the device names for
your attached changers. Make sure to configure your sgen
driver first.</p>

<p>BUGS AND LIMITATIONS This program has only been tested
on Linux with a limited number of loaders (Ecrix Autopack,
Exabyte 220).</p>

<p>AVAILABILITY loaderinfo is currently being maintained by
Robert Nelson &lt;robertnel- son@users.sourceforge.net&gt;
as part of the mtx suite of programs. The mtx home page is
http://mtx.sourceforge.net and the actual code is currently
available there and via SVN from http://source-
forge.net/projects/mtx.</p>
