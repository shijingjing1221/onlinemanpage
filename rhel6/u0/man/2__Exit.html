<p>_EXIT(2) Linux Programmer s Manual _EXIT(2)</p>

<p>NAME _exit, _Exit - terminate the calling process</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>void _exit(int status);</p>

<p>#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</p>

<p>void _Exit(int status);</p>

<p>Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
feature_test_macros(7)):</p>

<p>_Exit(): _XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;= 600 || _ISOC99_SOURCE; or
cc -std=c99</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The function _exit() terminates the calling
process &quot;immediately&quot;. Any open file descriptors
belonging to the process are closed; any children of the
process are inherited by process 1, init, and the processs
par- ent is sent a SIGCHLD signal.</p>

<p>The value status is returned to the parent process as
the processs exit status, and can be collected using one of
the wait(2) family of calls.</p>

<p>The function _Exit() is equivalent to _exit().</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE These functions do not return.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO SVr4, POSIX.1-2001, 4.3BSD. The function
_Exit() was introduced by C99.</p>

<p>NOTES For a discussion on the effects of an exit, the
transmission of exit status, zombie processes, signals sent,
etc., see exit(3).</p>

<p>The function _exit() is like exit(3), but does not call
any functions registered with atexit(3) or on_exit(3).
Whether it flushes standard I/O buffers and removes
temporary files created with tmpfile(3) is
implementation-dependent. On the other hand, _exit() does
close open file descriptors, and this may cause an unknown
delay, waiting for pending output to finish. If the delay is
undesired, it may be useful to call functions like
tcflush(3) before calling _exit(). Whether any pending I/O
is canceled, and which pending I/O may be canceled upon
_exit(), is implementation-dependent.</p>

<p>In glibc up to version 2.3, the _exit() wrapper function
invoked the kernel system call of the same name. Since glibc
2.3, the wrapper function invokes exit_group(2), in order to
terminate all of the threads in a process.</p>
