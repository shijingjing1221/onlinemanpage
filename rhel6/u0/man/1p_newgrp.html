<p>NEWGRP(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual NEWGRP(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME newgrp - change to a new group</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS newgrp [-l][group]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The newgrp utility shall create a new shell
execution environment with a new real and effective group
identification. Of the attributes listed in Shell Execution
Environment, the new shell execution environment shall
retain the working directory, file creation mask, and
exported variables from the previous environment (that is,
open files, traps, unexported variables, alias definitions,
shell functions, and set options may be lost). All other
aspects of the process environment that are preserved by the
exec family of functions defined in the System Interfaces
volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 shall also be preserved by
newgrp; whether other aspects are preserved is
unspecified.</p>

<p>A failure to assign the new group identifications (for
example, for security or password-related reasons) shall not
prevent the new shell execution environment from being
created.</p>

<p>The newgrp utility shall affect the supplemental groups
for the process as follows:</p>

<p>* On systems where the effective group ID is normally in
the supple- mentary group list (or whenever the old
effective group ID actually is in the supplementary group
list):</p>

<p>* If the new effective group ID is also in the
supplementary group list, newgrp shall change the effective
group ID.</p>

<p>* If the new effective group ID is not in the
supplementary group list, newgrp shall add the new effective
group ID to the list, if there is room to add it.</p>

<p>* On systems where the effective group ID is not
normally in the sup- plementary group list (or whenever the
old effective group ID is not in the supplementary group
list):</p>

<p>* If the new effective group ID is in the supplementary
group list, newgrp shall delete it.</p>

<p>* If the old effective group ID is not in the
supplementary list, newgrp shall add it if there is
room.</p>

<p>Note: The System Interfaces volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001 does not specify whether the effective group ID
of a process is included in its supplementary group
list.</p>

<p>With no operands, newgrp shall change the effective
group back to the groups identified in the users user entry,
and shall set the list of supplementary groups to that set
in the users group database entries.</p>

<p>If a password is required for the specified group, and
the user is not listed as a member of that group in the
group database, the user shall be prompted to enter the
correct password for that group. If the user is listed as a
member of that group, no password shall be requested. If no
password is required for the specified group, it is
implementation- defined whether users not listed as members
of that group can change to that group. Whether or not a
password is required, implementation- defined system
accounting or security mechanisms may impose additional
authorization restrictions that may cause newgrp to write a
diagnostic message and suppress the changing of the group
identification.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The newgrp utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>The following option shall be supported:</p>

<p>-l (The letter ell.) Change the environment to what
would be expected if the user actually logged in again.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p>group A group name from the group database or a
non-negative numeric group ID. Specifies the group ID to
which the real and effective group IDs shall be set. If
group is a non-negative numeric string and exists in the
group database as a group name (see getgrnam()), the numeric
group ID associated with that group name shall be used as
the group ID.</p>

<p>STDIN Not used.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES The file /dev/tty shall be used to read a
single line of text for pass- word checking, when one is
required.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of new- grp:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in
arguments).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT Not used.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used for diagnostic
messages and a prompt string for a password, if one is
required. Diagnostic messages may be written in cases where
the exit status is not available. See the EXIT STATUS
section.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS If newgrp succeeds in creating a new shell
execution environment, whether or not the group
identification was changed successfully, the exit status
shall be the exit status of the shell. Otherwise, the fol-
lowing exit value shall be returned:</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS The invoking shell may
terminate.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE There is no convenient way to enter a
password into the group database. Use of group passwords is
not encouraged, because by their very nature they encourage
poor security practices. Group passwords may disappear in
the future.</p>

<p>A common implementation of newgrp is that the current
shell uses exec to overlay itself with newgrp, which in turn
overlays itself with a new shell after changing group. On
some implementations, however, this may not occur and newgrp
may be invoked as a subprocess.</p>

<p>The newgrp command is intended only for use from an
interactive termi- nal. It does not offer a useful interface
for the support of applica- tions.</p>

<p>The exit status of newgrp is generally inapplicable. If
newgrp is used in a script, in most cases it successfully
invokes a new shell and the rest of the original shell
script is bypassed when the new shell exits. Used
interactively, newgrp displays diagnostic messages to
indicate problems. But usage such as:</p>

<p>newgrp foo echo $?</p>

<p>is not useful because the new shell might not have
access to any status newgrp may have generated (and most
historical systems do not provide this status). A zero
status echoed here does not necessarily indicate that the
user has changed to the new group successfully. Following
newgrp with the id command provides a portable means of
determining whether the group change was successful or
not.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE Most historical implementations use one of the
exec functions to imple- ment the behavior of newgrp. Errors
detected before the exec leave the environment unchanged,
while errors detected after the exec leave the user in a
changed environment. While it would be useful to have newgrp
issue a diagnostic message to tell the user that the
environment changed, it would be inappropriate to require
this change to some his- torical implementations.</p>

<p>The password mechanism is allowed in the group database,
but how this would be implemented is not specified.</p>

<p>The newgrp utility was retained in this volume of IEEE
Std 1003.1-2001, even given the existence of the multiple
group permissions feature in the System Interfaces volume of
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, for several rea- sons. First, in some
implementations, the group ownership of a newly created file
is determined by the group of the directory in which the
file is created, as allowed by the System Interfaces volume
of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001; on other implementations, the group
ownership of a newly created file is determined by the
effective group ID. On imple- mentations of the latter type,
newgrp allows files to be created with a specific group
ownership. Finally, many implementations use the real group
ID in accounting, and on such systems, newgrp allows the
account- ing identity of the user to be changed.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
