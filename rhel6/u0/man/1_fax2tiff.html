<p>NAME fax2tiff - create a TIFF Class F fax file from raw
fax data</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS fax2tiff [ options ] [ -o output.tif ]
input.raw</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Fax2tiff creates a TIFF file containing
CCITT Group 3 or Group 4 encoded data from one or more files
containing raw Group 3 or Group 4 encoded data (typically
obtained directly from a fax modem). By default, each row of
data in the resultant TIFF file is 1-dimensionally encoded
and padded or truncated to 1728 pixels, as needed. The
resul- tant image is a set of low resolution (98 lines/inch)
or medium resolu- tion (196 lines/inch) pages, each of which
is a single strip of data. The generated file conforms to
the TIFF Class F (FAX) specification for storing facsimile
data. This means, in particular, that each page of the data
does not include the trailing return to control (RTC) code;
as required for transmission by the CCITT Group 3
specifications. The old, classic, format is created if the
-c option is used. (The Class F format can also be requested
with the -f option.)</p>

<p>The default name of the output image is fax.tif; this
can be changed with the -o option. Each input file is
assumed to be a separate page of facsimile data from the
same document. The order in which input files are specified
on the command line is the order in which the resultant
pages appear in the output file.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Options that affect the interpretation of input
data are:</p>

<p>-3 Assume input data is CCITT Group 3 encoded
(default).</p>

<p>-4 Assume input data is CCITT Group 4 encoded.</p>

<p>-U Assume input data is uncompressed (Group 3 or Group
4).</p>

<p>-1 Assume input data is encoded with the 1-dimensional
version of the CCITT Group 3 Huffman encoding algorithm
(default).</p>

<p>-2 Assume input data is 2-dimensional version of the
CCITT Group 3 Huffman encoding algorithm.</p>

<p>-P Assume input data is not EOL-aligned (default). This
option has effect with Group 3 encoded input only.</p>

<p>-A Assume input data is EOL-aligned. This option has
effect with Group 3 encoded input only.</p>

<p>-M Treat input data as having bits filled from most
significant bit (MSB) to most least bit (LSB).</p>

<p>-L Treat input data as having bits filled from least
significant bit (LSB) to most significant bit (MSB)
(default).</p>

<p>-B Assume input data was encoded with black as 0 and
white as 1.</p>

<p>-W Assume input data was encoded with black as 1 and
white as 0 (default).</p>

<p>-R Specify the vertical resolution, in lines/inch, of
the input images. By default input are assumed to have a
vertical resolu- tion of 196 lines/inch. If images are low
resolution facsimile, a value of 98 lines/inch should be
specified.</p>

<p>-X Specify the width, in pixels, of the input images. By
default input are assumed to have a width of 1728
pixels.</p>

<p>Options that affect the output file format are:</p>

<p>-o Specify the name of the output file.</p>

<p>-7 Force output to be compressed with the CCITT Group 3
Huffman encoding algorithm (default).</p>

<p>-8 Force output to be compressed with the CCITT Group 4
Huffman encoding.</p>

<p>-u Force output to be uncompressed (Group 3 or Group
4).</p>

<p>-5 Force output to be encoded with the 1-dimensional
version of the CCITT Group 3 Huffman encoding algorithm.</p>

<p>-6 Force output to be encoded with the 2-dimensional
version of the CCITT Group 3 Huffman encoding algorithm
(default).</p>

<p>-a Force the last bit of each End Of Line (EOL) code to
land on a byte boundary (default). This zero padding will be
reflected in the contents of the Group3Options tag of the
resultant TIFF file. This option has effect with Group 3
encoded output only.</p>

<p>-p Do not EOL-align output. This option has effect with
Group 3 encoded output only.</p>

<p>-c Generate &quot;classic&quot; Group 3 TIFF format.</p>

<p>-f Generate TIFF Class F (TIFF/F) format (default).</p>

<p>-m Force output data to have bits filled from most
significant bit (MSB) to most least bit (LSB).</p>

<p>-l Force output data to have bits filled from least
significant bit (LSB) to most significant bit (MSB)
(default).</p>

<p>-r Specify the number of rows (scanlines) in each strip
of data written to the output file. By default (or when
value 0 is specified), tiffcp attempts to set the rows/strip
that no more than 8 kilobytes of data appear in a strip
(with except of G3/G4 compression schemes). If you specify
special value -1 it will results in infinite number of the
rows per strip. The entire image will be the one strip in
that case. This is default in case of G3/G4 output
compression schemes.</p>

<p>-s Stretch the input image vertically by writing each
input row of data twice to the output file.</p>

<p>-v Force fax2tiff to print the number of rows of data it
retrieved from the input file.</p>

<p>-z Force output to be compressed with the LZW
encoding.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS The following warnings and errors come from
the decoding routines in the library.</p>

<p>Warning, %s: Premature EOL at scanline %d (x %d)n. The
input data had a row that was shorter than the expected
width. The row is padded with white.</p>

<p>%s: Premature EOF at scanline %d (x %d)n. The decoder
ran out of data in the middle of a scanline. The resultant
row is padded with white.</p>

<p>%s: Bad code word at row %d, x %n. An invalid Group 3
code was encountered while decoding the input file. The row
number and horizon- tal position is given. The remainder of
the input row is discarded, while the corresponding output
row is padded with white.</p>

<p>%s: Bad 2D code word at scanline %dn. An invalid Group 4
or 2D Group 3 code was encountered while decoding the input
file. The row number and horizontal position is given. The
remainder of the input row is discarded, while the
corresponding output row is padded with white.</p>

<p>BUGS Input data are assumed to have a a top left
orientation; it should be possible to override this
assumption from the command line.</p>
