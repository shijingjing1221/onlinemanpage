<p>PAM_ENV.CONF(5) Linux-PAM Manual PAM_ENV.CONF(5)</p>

<p>NAME pam_env.conf - the environment variables config
file</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The /etc/security/pam_env.conf file
specifies the environment variables to be set, unset or
modified by pam_env(8). When someone logs in, this file is
read and the environment variables are set according.</p>

<p>Each line starts with the variable name, there are then
two possible options for each variable DEFAULT and OVERRIDE.
DEFAULT allows and administrator to set the value of the
variable to some default value, if none is supplied then the
empty string is assumed. The OVERRIDE option tells pam_env
that it should enter in its value (overriding the default
value) if there is one to use. OVERRIDE is not used,
&quot;&quot; is assumed and no override will be done.</p>

<p>VARIABLE [DEFAULT=[value]] [OVERRIDE=[value]]</p>

<p>(Possibly non-existent) environment variables may be
used in values using the ${string} syntax and (possibly
non-existent) PAM_ITEMs may be used in values using the
@{string} syntax. Both the $ and @ characters can be
backslash escaped to be used as literal values values can be
delimited with &quot;&quot;, escaped &quot; not supported.
Note that many environment variables that you would like to
use may not be set by the time the module is called. For
example, HOME is used below several times, but many PAM
applications don&acute;t make it available by the time you
need it.</p>

<p>The &quot;#&quot; character at start of line (no space
at front) can be used to mark this line as a comment
line.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES These are some example lines which might be
specified in /etc/security/pam_env.conf.</p>

<p>Set the REMOTEHOST variable for any hosts that are
remote, default to &quot;localhost&quot; rather than not
being set at all</p>

<p>REMOTEHOST DEFAULT=localhost OVERRIDE=@{PAM_RHOST}</p>

<p>Set the DISPLAY variable if it seems reasonable</p>

<p>DISPLAY DEFAULT=${REMOTEHOST}:0.0
OVERRIDE=${DISPLAY}</p>

<p>Now some simple variables</p>

<p>PAGER DEFAULT=less MANPAGER DEFAULT=less LESS
DEFAULT=&quot;M q e h15 z23 b80&quot; NNTPSERVER
DEFAULT=localhost PATH
DEFAULT=${HOME}/bin:/usr/local/bin:/bin
:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin/X11:/usr/bin/X11</p>

<p>Silly examples of escaped variables, just to show how
they work.</p>

<p>DOLLAR DEFAULT= DOLLARDOLLAR DEFAULT= OVERRIDE={DOLLAR}
DOLLARPLUS DEFAULT=REMOTEHOST}${REMOTEHOST} ATSIGN
DEFAULT=&quot;&quot; OVERRIDE=@</p>
