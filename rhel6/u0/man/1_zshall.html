<p>ZSHALL(1) ZSHALL(1)</p>

<p>NAME zshall - the Z shell meta-man page</p>

<p>OVERVIEW Because zsh contains many features, the zsh
manual has been split into a number of sections. This manual
page includes all the separate man- ual pages in the
following order:</p>

<p>zshroadmap Informal introduction to the manual zshmisc

Zsh built-in calendar functions zshtcpsys Zsh built-in TCP
functions zshzftpsys Zsh built-in FTP client zshcontrib
Additional zsh functions and utilities</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Zsh is a UNIX command interpreter (shell)
usable as an interactive login shell and as a shell script
command processor. Of the standard shells, zsh most closely
resembles ksh but includes many enhancements. Zsh has
command line editing, builtin spelling correction,
programmable command completion, shell functions (with
autoloading), a history mech- anism, and a host of other
features.</p>

<p>AUTHOR Zsh was originally written by Paul Falstad
&lt;pf@zsh.org&gt;. Zsh is now maintained by the members of
the zsh-workers mailing list &lt;zsh-work-
ers@sunsite.dk&gt;. The development is currently coordinated
by Peter Stephenson &lt;pws@zsh.org&gt;. The coordinator can
be contacted at &lt;coordi- nator@zsh.org&gt;, but matters
relating to the code should generally go to the mailing
list.</p>

&lt;webmaster@zsh.org&gt;.</p>

<p>THE ZSH USERGUIDE A userguide is currently in
preparation. It is intended to complement the manual, with
explanations and hints on issues where the manual can be
cabbalistic, hierographic, or downright mystifying (for
example, the word hierographic does not exist). It can be
viewed in its current state at http://zsh.sunsite.dk/Guide/.
At the time of writing, chap- ters dealing with startup
files and their contents and the new comple- tion system
were essentially complete.</p>

<p>THE ZSH WIKI A wiki website for zsh has been created at
http://www.zshwiki.org/. This is a site which can be added
to and modified directly by users without any special
permission. You can add your own zsh tips and con-
figurations.</p>

<p>INVOCATION OPTIONS The following flags are interpreted
by the shell when invoked to deter- mine where the shell
will read commands from:</p>

<p>-c Take the first argument as a command to execute,
rather than reading commands from a script or standard
input. If any fur- ther arguments are given, the first one
is assigned to $0, rather than being used as a positional
parameter.</p>

<p>-i Force shell to be interactive.</p>

<p>-s Force shell to read commands from the standard input.
If the -s flag is not present and an argument is given, the
first argument is taken to be the pathname of a script to
execute.</p>

<p>After the first one or two arguments have been
appropriated as described above, the remaining arguments are
assigned to the positional parameters.</p>

<p>For further options, which are common to invocation and
the set builtin, see zshoptions(1).</p>

<p>Options may be specified by name using the -o option. -o
acts like a single-letter option, but takes a following
string as the option name. For example,</p>

<p>zsh -x -o shwordsplit scr</p>

<p>runs the script scr, setting the XTRACE option by the
corresponding letter -x and the SH_WORD_SPLIT option by
name. Options may be turned off by name by using +o instead
of -o. -o can be stacked up with preceding single-letter
options, so for example -xo shwordsplit or -xoshwordsplit is
equivalent to -x -o shwordsplit.</p>

<p>Options may also be specified by name in GNU long option
style, --option-name. When this is done, - characters in the
option name are permitted: they are translated into _, and
thus ignored. So, for example, zsh --sh-word-split invokes
zsh with the SH_WORD_SPLIT option turned on. Like other
option syntaxes, options can be turned off by replacing the
initial - with a + ; thus +-sh-word-split is equivalent to
--no-sh-word-split . Unlike other option syntaxes, GNU-style
long options cannot be stacked with any other options, so
for example -x-shwordsplit is an error, rather than being
treated like -x --shwordsplit.</p>

<p>The special GNU-style option --version is handled; it
sends to stan- dard output the shells version information,
then exits successfully. --help is also handled; it sends to
standard output a list of options that can be used when
invoking the shell, then exits successfully.</p>

<p>Option processing may be finished, allowing following
arguments that start with - or + to be treated as normal
arguments, in two ways. Firstly, a lone - (or +) as an
argument by itself ends option pro- cessing. Secondly, a
special option -- (or +-), which may be spec- ified on its
own (which is the standard POSIX usage) or may be stacked
with preceding options (so -x- is equivalent to -x --).
Options are not permitted to be stacked after -- (so -x-f is
an error), but note the GNU-style option form discussed
above, where --shwordsplit is permitted and does not end
option processing.</p>

<p>Except when the sh/ksh emulation single-letter options
are in effect, the option -b (or +b) ends option processing.
-b is like --, except that further single-letter options can
be stacked after the -b and will take effect as normal.</p>

<p>COMPATIBILITY Zsh tries to emulate sh or ksh when it is
invoked as sh or ksh respec- tively; more precisely, it
looks at the first letter of the name by which it was
invoked, excluding any initial r (assumed to stand for
restricted), and if that is s or k it will emulate sh or
ksh. Furthermore, if invoked as su (which happens on certain
systems when the shell is executed by the su command), the
shell will try to find an alternative name from the SHELL
environment variable and perform emula- tion based on
that.</p>

<p>In sh and ksh compatibility modes the following
parameters are not spe- cial and not initialized by the
shell: ARGC, argv, cdpath, fignore, fpath, HISTCHARS,
mailpath, MANPATH, manpath, path, prompt, PROMPT, PROMPT2,
PROMPT3, PROMPT4, psvar, status, watch.</p>

<p>The usual zsh startup/shutdown scripts are not executed.
Login shells source /etc/profile followed by $HOME/.profile.
If the ENV environment variable is set on invocation, $ENV
is sourced after the profile scripts. The value of ENV is
subjected to parameter expansion, command substitution, and
arithmetic expansion before being interpreted as a pathname.
Note that the PRIVILEGED option also affects the execution
of startup files.</p>

<p>The following options are set if the shell is invoked as
sh or ksh: NO_BAD_PATTERN, NO_BANG_HIST, NO_BG_NICE,
NO_EQUALS, NO_FUNC- TION_ARGZERO, GLOB_SUBST,
NO_GLOBAL_EXPORT, NO_HUP, INTERACTIVE_COM- MENTS,
KSH_ARRAYS, NO_MULTIOS, NO_NOMATCH, NO_NOTIFY,
POSIX_BUILTINS, NO_PROMPT_PERCENT, RM_STAR_SILENT,
SH_FILE_EXPANSION, SH_GLOB, SH_OPTION_LETTERS,
SH_WORD_SPLIT. Additionally the BSD_ECHO and IGNORE_BRACES
options are set if zsh is invoked as sh. Also, the
KSH_OPTION_PRINT, LOCAL_OPTIONS, PROMPT_BANG, PROMPT_SUBST
and SIN- GLE_LINE_ZLE options are set if zsh is invoked as
ksh.</p>

<p>RESTRICTED SHELL When the basename of the command used
to invoke zsh starts with the letter r or the -r command
line option is supplied at invocation, the shell becomes
restricted. Emulation mode is determined after stripping the
letter r from the invocation name. The following are
disabled in restricted mode:</p>

<p>&middot; changing directories with the cd builtin</p>

<p>&middot; changing or unsetting the PATH, path,
MODULE_PATH, module_path, SHELL, HISTFILE, HISTSIZE, GID,
EGID, UID, EUID, USERNAME, LD_LIBRARY_PATH,
LD_AOUT_LIBRARY_PATH, LD_PRELOAD and LD_AOUT_PRELOAD
parameters</p>

<p>&middot; specifying command names containing /</p>

<p>&middot; specifying command pathnames using hash</p>

<p>&middot; redirecting output to files</p>

<p>&middot; using the exec builtin command to replace the
shell with another command</p>

<p>&middot; using jobs -Z to overwrite the shell process
argument and envi- ronment space</p>

<p>&middot; using the ARGV0 parameter to override argv[0]
for external com- mands</p>

<p>&middot; turning off restricted mode with set +r or
unsetopt RESTRICTED</p>

<p>These restrictions are enforced after processing the
startup files. The startup files should set up PATH to point
to a directory of com- mands which can be safely invoked in
the restricted environment. They may also add further
restrictions by disabling selected builtins.</p>

<p>Restricted mode can also be activated any time by
setting the RESTRICTED option. This immediately enables all
the restrictions described above even if the shell still has
not processed all startup files.</p>

<p>STARTUP/SHUTDOWN FILES Commands are first read from
/etc/zshenv; this cannot be overridden. Subsequent behaviour
is modified by the RCS and GLOBAL_RCS options; the former
affects all startup files, while the second only affects
global startup files (those shown here with an path starting
with a /). If one of the options is unset at any point, any
subsequent startup file(s) of the corresponding type will
not be read. It is also possi- ble for a file in $ZDOTDIR to
re-enable GLOBAL_RCS. Both RCS and GLOBAL_RCS are set by
default.</p>

<p>Commands are then read from $ZDOTDIR/.zshenv. If the
shell is a login shell, commands are read from /etc/zprofile
and then $ZDOTDIR/.zpro- file. Then, if the shell is
interactive, commands are read from /etc/zshrc and then
$ZDOTDIR/.zshrc. Finally, if the shell is a login shell,
/etc/zlogin and $ZDOTDIR/.zlogin are read.</p>

<p>When a login shell exits, the files $ZDOTDIR/.zlogout
and then /etc/zlogout are read. This happens with either an
explicit exit via the exit or logout commands, or an
implicit exit by reading end-of-file from the terminal.
However, if the shell terminates due to execing another
process, the logout files are not read. These are also
affected by the RCS and GLOBAL_RCS options. Note also that
the RCS option affects the saving of history files, i.e. if
RCS is unset when the shell exits, no history file will be
saved.</p>

<p>If ZDOTDIR is unset, HOME is used instead. Files listed
above as being in /etc may be in another directory,
depending on the installation.</p>

<p>As /etc/zshenv is run for all instances of zsh, it is
important that it be kept as small as possible. In
particular, it is a good idea to put code that does not need
to be run for every single shell behind a test of the form
if [[ -o rcs ]]; then ... so that it will not be executed
when zsh is invoked with the -f option.</p>

<p>Any of these files may be pre-compiled with the zcompile
builtin command (see zshbuiltins(1)). If a compiled file
exists (named for the original file plus the .zwc extension)
and it is newer than the origi- ZSHROADMAP(1)
ZSHROADMAP(1)</p>

<p>nal file, the compiled file will be used instead.</p>

<p>NAME zshroadmap - informal introduction to the zsh
manual</p>

<p>The Zsh Manual, like the shell itself, is large and
often complicated. This section of the manual provides some
pointers to areas of the shell that are likely to be of
particular interest to new users, and indi- cates where in
the rest of the manual the documentation is to be found.</p>

<p>WHEN THE SHELL STARTS When it starts, the shell reads
commands from various files. These can be created or edited
to customize the shell. See the section Startup/Shutdown
Files in zsh(1).</p>

<p>If no personal initialization files exist for the
current user, a func- tion is run to help you change some of
the most common settings. It won t appear if your
administrator has disabled the zsh/newuser module. The
function is designed to be self-explanatory. You can run it
by hand with autoload -Uz zsh-newuser-install;
zsh-newuser-install -f. See also the section User
Configuration Functions in zshcontrib(1).</p>

<p>INTERACTIVE USE Interaction with the shell uses the
builtin Zsh Line Editor, ZLE. This is described in detail in
zshzle(1).</p>

<p>The first decision a user must make is whether to use
the Emacs or Vi editing mode as the keys for editing are
substantially different. Emacs editing mode is probably more
natural for beginners and can be selected explicitly with
the command bindkey -e.</p>

<p>A history mechanism for retrieving previously typed
lines (most simply with the Up or Down arrow keys) is
available; note that, unlike other shells, zsh will not save
these lines when the shell exits unless you set appropriate
variables, and the number of history lines retained by
default is quite small (30 lines). See the description of
the shell variables (referred to in the documentation as
parameters) HISTFILE, HISTSIZE and SAVEHIST in
zshparam(1).</p>

<p>The shell now supports the UTF-8 character set (and also
others if sup- ported by the operating system). This is
(mostly) handled transpar- ently by the shell, but the
degree of support in terminal emulators is variable. There
is some discussion of this in the shell FAQ,
http://zsh.dotsrc.org/FAQ/ . Note in particular that for
combining characters to be handled the option
COMBINING_CHARS needs to be set. Because the shell is now
more sensitive to the definition of the char- acter set,
note that if you are upgrading from an older version of the
shell you should ensure that the appropriate variable,
either LANG (to affect all aspects of the shells operation)
or LC_CTYPE (to affect only the handling of character sets)
is set to an appropriate value. This is true even if you are
using a single-byte character set includ- ing extensions of
ASCII such as ISO-8859-1 or ISO-8859-15. See the description
of LC_CTYPE in zshparam(1).</p>

<p>Completion Completion is a feature present in many
shells. It allows the user to type only a part (usually the
prefix) of a word and have the shell fill in the rest. The
completion system in zsh is programmable. For exam- ple, the
shell can be set to complete email addresses in arguments to
the mail command from your ~/.abook/addressbook; usernames,
hostnames, and even remote paths in arguments to scp, and so
on. Anything that can be written in or glued together with
zsh can be the source of what the line editor offers as
possible completions.</p>

<p>Zsh has two completion systems, an old, so called
compctl completion (named after the builtin command that
serves as its complete and only user interface), and a new
one, referred to as compsys, organized as library of builtin
and user-defined functions. The two systems differ in their
interface for specifying the completion behavior. The new
system is more customizable and is supplied with completions
for many commonly used commands; it is therefore to be
preferred.</p>

<p>The completion system must be enabled explicitly when
the shell starts. For more information see
zshcompsys(1).</p>

<p>Extending the line editor Apart from completion, the
line editor is highly extensible by means of shell
functions. Some useful functions are provided with the
shell; they provide facilities such as:</p>

<p>insert-composed-char composing characters not found on
the keyboard</p>

<p>match-words-by-style configuring what the line editor
considers a word when moving or deleting by word</p>

<p>history-beginning-search-backward-end, etc. alternative
ways of searching the shell history</p>

<p>replace-string, replace-pattern functions for replacing
strings or patterns globally in the com- mand line</p>

<p>edit-command-line edit the command line with an external
editor.</p>

<p>See the section ZLE Functions in zshcontrib(1) for
descriptions of these.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The shell has a large number of options for
changing its behaviour. These cover all aspects of the
shell; browsing the full documentation is the only good way
to become acquainted with the many possibilities. See
zshoptions(1).</p>

<p>PATTERN MATCHING The shell has a rich set of patterns
which are available for file matching (described in the
documentation as filename generation and also known for
historical reasons as globbing) and for use when pro-
gramming. These are described in the section Filename
Generation in zshexpn(1).</p>

<p>Of particular interest are the following patterns that
are not commonly supported by other systems of pattern
matching:</p>

<p>** for matching over multiple directories</p>

<p>~, ^ the ability to exclude patterns from matching when
the EXTENDED_GLOB option is set</p>

<p>(...) glob qualifiers, included in parentheses at the
end of the pat- tern, which select files by type (such as
directories) or attribute (such as size).</p>

<p>GENERAL COMMENTS ON SYNTAX Although the syntax of zsh is
in ways similar to the Korn shell, and therefore more
remotely to the original UNIX shell, the Bourne shell, its
default behaviour does not entirely correspond to those
shells. General shell syntax is introduced in the section
Shell Grammar in zshmisc(1).</p>

<p>One commonly encountered difference is that variables
substituted onto the command line are not split into words.
See the description of the shell option SH_WORD_SPLIT in the
section Parameter Expansion in zsh- expn(1). In zsh, you can
either explicitly request the splitting (e.g. ${=foo}) or
use an array when you want a variable to expand to more than
one word. See the section Array Parameters in
zshparam(1).</p>

<p>PROGRAMMING The most convenient way of adding
enhancements to the shell is typi- cally by writing a shell
function and arranging for it to be autoloaded. Functions
are described in the section Functions in zsh- misc(1).
Users changing from the C shell and its relatives should
notice that aliases are less used in zsh as they don t
perform argument substitution, only simple text
replacement.</p>

<p>A few general functions, other than those for the line
editor described above, are provided with the shell and are
described in zshcontrib(1). Features include:</p>

<p>promptinit a prompt theme system for changing prompts
easily, see the sec- tion Prompt Themes</p>

<p>zsh-mime-setup a MIME-handling system which dispatches
commands according to the suffix of a file as done by
graphical file managers</p>

<p>zcalc a calculator</p>

<p>zargs a version of xargs that makes the find command
redundant</p>

<p>ZSHMISC(1) ZSHMISC(1)</p>

<p>zmv a command for renaming files by means of shell
patterns.</p>

<p>NAME zshmisc - everything and then some</p>

<p>SIMPLE COMMANDS &amp; PIPELINES A simple command is a
sequence of optional parameter assignments fol- lowed by
blank-separated words, with optional redirections inter-
spersed. The first word is the command to be executed, and
the remain- ing words, if any, are arguments to the command.
If a command name is given, the parameter assignments modify
the environment of the command when it is executed. The
value of a simple command is its exit status, or 128 plus
the signal number if terminated by a signal. For
example,</p>

<p>echo foo</p>

<p>is a simple command with arguments.</p>

<p>A pipeline is either a simple command, or a sequence of
two or more simple commands where each command is separated
from the next by | or |&amp;. Where commands are separated
by | , the standard output of the first command is connected
to the standard input of the next. |&amp; is shorthand for
2&gt;&amp;1 |, which connects both the standard output and
the standard error of the command to the standard input of
the next. The value of a pipeline is the value of the last
command, unless the pipeline is preceded by ! in which case
the value is the logical inverse of the value of the last
command. For example,</p>

<p>echo foo | seds/foo/bar/</p>

<p>is a pipeline, where the output (foo plus a newline) of
the first command will be passed to the input of the
second.</p>

<p>If a pipeline is preceded by coproc, it is executed as a
coprocess; a two-way pipe is established between it and the
parent shell. The shell can read from or write to the
coprocess by means of the &gt;&amp;p and &lt;&amp;p
redirection operators or with print -p and read -p. A
pipeline cannot be preceded by both coproc and !. If job
control is active, the coprocess can be treated in other
than input and output as an ordi- nary background job.</p>

<p>A sublist is either a single pipeline, or a sequence of
two or more pipelines separated by &amp;&amp; or ||. If two
pipelines are separated by &amp;&amp; , the second pipeline
is executed only if the first succeeds (returns a zero
status). If two pipelines are separated by ||, the second is
executed only if the first fails (returns a nonzero status).
Both operators have equal precedence and are left
associative. The value of the sublist is the value of the
last pipeline executed. For example,</p>

<p>dmesg | grep panic &amp;&amp; print yes</p>

<p>is a sublist consisting of two pipelines, the second
just a simple com- mand which will be executed if and only
if the grep command returns a zero status. If it does not,
the value of the sublist is that return status, else it is
the status returned by the print (almost certainly
zero).</p>

<p>A list is a sequence of zero or more sublists, in which
each sublist is terminated by ; , &amp; , &amp;| , &amp;!,
or a newline. This terminator may optionally be omitted from
the last sublist in the list when the list appears as a
complex command inside (...) or {...}. When a sublist is
terminated by ; or newline, the shell waits for it to finish
before executing the next sublist. If a sublist is
terminated by a &amp;, &amp;|, or &amp;!, the shell executes
the last pipeline in it in the background, and does not wait
for it to finish (note the difference from other shells
which execute the whole sublist in the background). A
backgrounded pipeline returns a status of zero.</p>

<p>More generally, a list can be seen as a set of any shell
commands what- soever, including the complex commands below;
this is implied wherever the word list appears in later
descriptions. For example, the com- mands in a shell
function form a special sort of list.</p>

<p>PRECOMMAND MODIFIERS A simple command may be preceded by
a precommand modifier, which will alter how the command is
interpreted. These modifiers are shell builtin commands with
the exception of nocorrect which is a reserved word.</p>

<p>- The command is executed with a - prepended to its
argv[0] string.</p>

<p>builtin The command word is taken to be the name of a
builtin command, rather than a shell function or external
command.</p>

<p>command [ -pvV ] The command word is taken to be the
name of an external command, rather than a shell function or
builtin. If the POSIX_BUILTINS option is set, builtins will
also be executed but certain spe- cial properties of them
are suppressed. The -p flag causes a default path to be
searched instead of that in $path. With the -v flag, command
is similar to whence and with -V, it is equiva- lent to
whence -v.</p>

<p>exec [ -cl ] [ -a argv0 ] The following command together
with any arguments is run in place of the current process,
rather than as a sub-process. The shell does not fork and is
replaced. The shell does not invoke TRAPEXIT, nor does it
source zlogout files. The options are provided for
compatibility with other shells.</p>

<p>The -c option clears the environment.</p>

<p>The -l option is equivalent to the - precommand
modifier, to treat the replacement command as a login shell;
the command is executed with a - prepended to its argv[0]
string. This flag has no effect if used together with the -a
option.</p>

<p>The -a option is used to specify explicitly the argv[0]
string (the name of the command as seen by the process
itself) to be used by the replacement command and is
directly equivalent to setting a value for the ARGV0
environment variable.</p>

<p>nocorrect Spelling correction is not done on any of the
words. This must appear before any other precommand
modifier, as it is inter- preted immediately, before any
parsing is done. It has no effect in non-interactive
shells.</p>

<p>noglob Filename generation (globbing) is not performed
on any of the words.</p>

<p>COMPLEX COMMANDS A complex command in zsh is one of the
following:</p>

<p>if list then list [ elif list then list ] ... [ else
list ] fi The if list is executed, and if it returns a zero
exit status, the then list is executed. Otherwise, the elif
list is executed and if its status is zero, the then list is
executed. If each elif list returns nonzero status, the else
list is executed.</p>

<p>for name ... [ in word ... ] term do list done where
term is at least one newline or ;. Expand the list of words,
and set the parameter name to each of them in turn, exe-
cuting list each time. If the in word is omitted, use the
posi- tional parameters instead of the words.</p>

<p>More than one parameter name can appear before the list
of words. If N names are given, then on each execution of
the loop the next N words are assigned to the corresponding
parameters. If there are more names than remaining words,
the remaining parameters are each set to the empty string.
Execution of the loop ends when there is no remaining word
to assign to the first name. It is only possible for in to
appear as the first name in the list, else it will be
treated as marking the end of the list.</p>

<p>for (( [expr1] ; [expr2] ; [expr3] )) do list done The
arithmetic expression expr1 is evaluated first (see the sec-
tion Arithmetic Evaluation ). The arithmetic expression
expr2 is repeatedly evaluated until it evaluates to zero and
when non-zero, list is executed and the arithmetic
expression expr3 evaluated. If any expression is omitted,
then it behaves as if it evaluated to 1.</p>

<p>while list do list done Execute the do list as long as
the while list returns a zero exit status.</p>

<p>until list do list done Execute the do list as long as
until list returns a nonzero exit status.</p>

<p>repeat word do list done word is expanded and treated as
an arithmetic expression, which must evaluate to a number n.
list is then executed n times.</p>

<p>case word in [ [(] pattern [ | pattern ] ... ) list
(;;|;&amp;|;|) ] ... esac Execute the list associated with
the first pattern that matches word, if any. The form of the
patterns is the same as that used for filename generation.
See the section Filename Generation.</p>

<p>If the list that is executed is terminated with ;&amp;
rather than ;;, the following list is also executed. The
rule for the ter- minator of the following list ;;, ;&amp;
or ;| is applied unless the esac is reached.</p>

<p>If the list that is executed is terminated with ;| the
shell continues to scan the patterns looking for the next
match, exe- cuting the corresponding list, and applying the
rule for the corresponding terminator ;;, ;&amp; or ;|. Note
that word is not re-expanded; all applicable patterns are
tested with the same word.</p>

<p>select name [ in word ... term ] do list done where term
is one or more newline or ; to terminate the words. Print
the set of words, each preceded by a number. If the in word
is omitted, use the positional parameters. The PROMPT3
prompt is printed and a line is read from the line editor if
the shell is interactive and that is active, or else
standard input. If this line consists of the number of one
of the listed words, then the parameter name is set to the
word corresponding to this number. If this line is empty,
the selection list is printed again. Otherwise, the value of
the parameter name is set to null. The contents of the line
read from standard input is saved in the parameter REPLY.
list is executed for each selec- tion until a break or
end-of-file is encountered.</p>

<p>( list ) Execute list in a subshell. Traps set by the
trap builtin are reset to their default values while
executing list.</p>

<p>{ list } Execute list.</p>

<p>{ try-list } always { always-list } First execute
try-list. Regardless of errors, or break, con- tinue, or
return commands encountered within try-list, execute
always-list. Execution then continues from the result of the
execution of try-list; in other words, any error, or break,
con- tinue, or return command is treated in the normal way,
as if always-list were not present. The two chunks of code
are referred to as the try block and the always block.</p>

<p>Optional newlines or semicolons may appear after the
always; note, however, that they may not appear between the
preceding closing brace and the always.</p>

<p>An error in this context is a condition such as a syntax
error which causes the shell to abort execution of the
current func- tion, script, or list. Syntax errors
encountered while the shell is parsing the code do not cause
the always-list to be executed. For example, an erroneously
constructed if block in try-list would cause the shell to
abort during parsing, so that always-list would not be
executed, while an erroneous substitu- tion such as ${*foo*}
would cause a run-time error, after which always-list would
be executed.</p>

<p>An error condition can be tested and reset with the
special integer variable TRY_BLOCK_ERROR. Outside an
always-list the value is irrelevant, but it is initialised
to -1. Inside always-list, the value is 1 if an error
occurred in the try-list, else 0. If TRY_BLOCK_ERROR is set
to 0 during the always-list, the error condition caused by
the try-list is reset, and shell execution continues
normally after the end of always-list. Altering the value
during the try-list is not use- ful (unless this forms part
of an enclosing always block).</p>

<p>Regardless of TRY_BLOCK_ERROR, after the end of
always-list the normal shell status $? is the value returned
from always-list. This will be non-zero if there was an
error, even if TRY_BLOCK_ERROR was set to zero.</p>

<p>The following executes the given code, ignoring any
errors it causes. This is an alternative to the usual
convention of pro- tecting code by executing it in a
subshell.</p>

<p>{ # code which may cause an error } always { # This code
is executed regardless of the error. (( TRY_BLOCK_ERROR = 0
)) } # The error condition has been reset.</p>

<p>An exit command (or a return command executed at the
outermost function level of a script) encountered in
try-list does not cause the execution of always-list.
Instead, the shell exits immediately after any EXIT trap has
been executed.</p>

<p>function word ... [ () ] [ term ] { list } word ... () [
term ] { list } word ... () [ term ] command where term is
one or more newline or ;. Define a function which is
referenced by any one of word. Normally, only one word is
provided; multiple words are usually only useful for setting
traps. The body of the function is the list between the {
and }. See the section Functions.</p>

<p>If the option SH_GLOB is set for compatibility with
other shells, then whitespace may appear between between the
left and right parentheses when there is a single word;
otherwise, the parentheses will be treated as forming a
globbing pattern in that case.</p>

<p>time [ pipeline ] The pipeline is executed, and timing
statistics are reported on the standard error in the form
specified by the TIMEFMT parame- ter. If pipeline is
omitted, print statistics about the shell process and its
children.</p>

<p>[[ exp ]] Evaluates the conditional expression exp and
return a zero exit status if it is true. See the section
Conditional Expressions for a description of exp.</p>

<p>ALTERNATE FORMS FOR COMPLEX COMMANDS Many of zsh s
complex commands have alternate forms. These particular
versions of complex commands should be considered deprecated
and may be removed in the future. The versions in the
previous section should be preferred instead.</p>

<p>The short versions below only work if sublist is of the
form { list } or if the SHORT_LOOPS option is set. For the
if, while and until com- mands, in both these cases the test
part of the loop must also be suit- ably delimited, such as
by [[ ... ]] or (( ... )) , else the end of the test will
not be recognized. For the for, repeat, case and select
commands no such special form for the arguments is
necessary, but the other condition (the special form of
sublist or use of the SHORT_LOOPS option) still applies.</p>

<p>if list { list } [ elif list { list } ] ... [ else {
list } ] An alternate form of if. The rules mean that</p>

<p>if [[ -o ignorebraces ]] { print yes }</p>

<p>works, but</p>

<p>if true { # Does not work! print yes }</p>

<p>does not, since the test is not suitably delimited.</p>

<p>if list sublist A short form of the alternate if . The
same limitations on the form of list apply as for the
previous form.</p>

<p>for name ... ( word ... ) sublist A short form of
for.</p>

<p>for name ... [ in word ... ] term sublist where term is
at least one newline or ;. Another short form of for.</p>

<p>for (( [expr1] ; [expr2] ; [expr3] )) sublist A short
form of the arithmetic for command.</p>

<p>foreach name ... ( word ... ) list end Another form of
for.</p>

<p>while list { list } An alternative form of while. Note
the limitations on the form of list mentioned above.</p>

<p>until list { list } An alternative form of until. Note
the limitations on the form of list mentioned above.</p>

<p>repeat word sublist This is a short form of repeat.</p>

<p>case word { [ [(] pattern [ | pattern ] ... ) list
(;;|;&amp;|;|) ] ... } An alternative form of case.</p>

<p>select name [ in word term ] sublist where term is at
least one newline or ;. A short form of select.</p>

<p>RESERVED WORDS The following words are recognized as
reserved words when used as the first word of a command
unless quoted or disabled using disable -r:</p>

<p>do done esac then elif else fi for case if while
function repeat time until select coproc nocorrect foreach
end ! [[ { }</p>

<p>Additionally, } is recognized in any position if the
IGNORE_BRACES option is not set.</p>

<p>COMMENTS In non-interactive shells, or in interactive
shells with the INTERAC- TIVE_COMMENTS option set, a word
beginning with the third character of the histchars
parameter (# by default) causes that word and all the
following characters up to a newline to be ignored.</p>

<p>ALIASING Every token in the shell input is checked to
see if there is an alias defined for it. If so, it is
replaced by the text of the alias if it is in command
position (if it could be the first word of a simple com-
mand), or if the alias is global. If the text ends with a
space, the next word in the shell input is treated as though
it were in command position for purposes of alias expansion.
An alias is defined using the alias builtin; global aliases
may be defined using the -g option to that builtin.</p>

<p>Alias expansion is done on the shell input before any
other expansion except history expansion. Therefore, if an
alias is defined for the word foo, alias expansion may be
avoided by quoting part of the word, e.g. foo. But there is
nothing to prevent an alias being defined for foo as
well.</p>

<p>There is a commonly encountered problem with aliases
illustrated by the following code:</p>

<p>alias echobarecho ba; echobar</p>

<p>This prints a message that the command echobar could not
be found. This happens because aliases are expanded when the
code is read in; the entire line is read in one go, so that
when echobar is executed it is too late to expand the newly
defined alias. This is often a problem in shell scripts,
functions, and code executed with source or .. Con-
sequently, use of functions rather than aliases is
recommended in non-interactive code.</p>

<p>QUOTING A character may be quoted (that is, made to
stand for itself) by pre- ceding it with a. followed by a
newline is ignored.</p>

<p>A string enclosed between $and is processed the same way
as the string arguments of the print builtin, and the
resulting string is con- sidered to be entirely quoted. A
literal character can be included in the string by using
theescape.</p>

<p>All characters enclosed between a pair of single quotes
) that is not preceded by a $ are quoted. A single quote
cannot appear within single quotes unless the option
RC_QUOTES is set, in which case a pair of single quotes are
turned into a single quote. For example,</p>

<p>print</p>

<p>outputs nothing apart from a newline if RC_QUOTES is not
set, but one single quote if it is set.</p>

<p>Inside double quotes (&quot;&quot;), parameter and
command substitution occur, and quotes the characters,,
&quot;, and $.</p>

<p>REDIRECTION If a command is followed by &amp; and job
control is not active, then the default standard input for
the command is the empty file /dev/null. Otherwise, the
environment for the execution of a command contains the file
descriptors of the invoking shell as modified by
input/output specifications.</p>

<p>The following may appear anywhere in a simple command or
may precede or follow a complex command. Expansion occurs
before word or digit is used except as noted below. If the
result of substitution on word pro- duces more than one
filename, redirection occurs for each separate filename in
turn.</p>

<p>&lt; word Open file word for reading as standard
input.</p>

<p>&lt;&gt; word Open file word for reading and writing as
standard input. If the file does not exist then it is
created.</p>

<p>&gt; word Open file word for writing as standard output.
If the file does not exist then it is created. If the file
exists, and the CLOB- BER option is unset, this causes an
error; otherwise, it is truncated to zero length.</p>

<p>&gt;| word &gt;! word Same as &gt;, except that the file
is truncated to zero length if it exists, even if CLOBBER is
unset.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; word Open file word for writing in append mode
as standard output. If the file does not exist, and the
CLOBBER option is unset, this causes an error; otherwise,
the file is created.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt;| word &gt;&gt;! word Same as &gt;&gt;, except
that the file is created if it does not exist, even if
CLOBBER is unset.</p>

<p>&lt;&lt;[-] word The shell input is read up to a line
that is the same as word, or to an end-of-file. No parameter
expansion, command substitu- tion or filename generation is
performed on word. The resulting document, called a
here-document, becomes the standard input.</p>

<p>If any character of word is quoted with single or double
quotes or a , no interpretation is placed upon the
characters of the document. Otherwise, parameter and command
substitution occurs, followed by a newline is removed, and
must be used to quote the characters, $, and the first
character of word.</p>

<p>Note that word itself does not undergo shell expansion.
Back- quotes in word do not have their usual effect; instead
they behave similarly to double quotes, except that the
backquotes themselves are passed through unchanged. (This
information is given for completeness and it is not
recommended that backquotes be used.) Quotes in the form $
... have their standard effect of expanding backslashed
references to special characters.</p>

<p>If &lt;&lt;- is used, then all leading tabs are stripped
from word and from the document.</p>

<p>&lt;&lt;&lt; word Perform shell expansion on word and
pass the result to standard input. This is known as a
here-string. Compare the use of word in here-documents
above, where word does not undergo shell expansion.</p>

<p>&lt;&amp; number &gt;&amp; number The standard
input/output is duplicated from file descriptor number (see
dup2(2)).</p>

<p>&lt;&amp; - &gt;&amp; - Close the standard
input/output.</p>

<p>&lt;&amp; p &gt;&amp; p The input/output from/to the
coprocess is moved to the standard input/output.</p>

<p>&gt;&amp; word &amp;&gt; word (Except where &gt;&amp;
word matches one of the above syntaxes; &amp;&gt; can always
be used to avoid this ambiguity.) Redirects both standard
output and standard error (file descriptor 2) in the manner
of &gt; word. Note that this does not have the same effect
as &gt; word 2&gt;&amp;1 in the presence of multios (see the
sec- tion below).</p>

<p>&gt;&amp;| word &gt;&amp;! word &amp;&gt;| word
&amp;&gt;! word Redirects both standard output and standard
error (file descrip- tor 2) in the manner of &gt;| word.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt;&amp; word &amp;&gt;&gt; word Redirects both
standard output and standard error (file descrip- tor 2) in
the manner of &gt;&gt; word.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt;&amp;| word &gt;&gt;&amp;! word &amp;&gt;&gt;|
word &amp;&gt;&gt;! word Redirects both standard output and
standard error (file descrip- tor 2) in the manner of
&gt;&gt;| word.</p>

<p>If one of the above is preceded by a digit, then the
file descriptor referred to is that specified by the digit
instead of the default 0 or 1. The order in which
redirections are specified is significant. The shell
evaluates each redirection in terms of the (file descriptor,
file) association at the time of evaluation. For
example:</p>

<p>... 1&gt;fname 2&gt;&amp;1</p>

<p>first associates file descriptor 1 with file fname. It
then associates file descriptor 2 with the file associated
with file descriptor 1 (that is, fname). If the order of
redirections were reversed, file descrip- tor 2 would be
associated with the terminal (assuming file descriptor 1 had
been) and then file descriptor 1 would be associated with
file fname.</p>

<p>If instead of a digit one of the operators above is
preceded by a valid identifier enclosed in braces, the shell
will open a new file descrip- tor that is guaranteed to be
at least 10 and set the parameter named by the identifier to
the file descriptor opened. No whitespace is allowed between
the closing brace and the redirection character. The option
IGNORE_BRACES must not be set. For example:</p>

<p>... {myfd}&gt;&amp;1</p>

<p>This opens a new file descriptor that is a duplicate of
file descriptor 1 and sets the parameter myfd to the number
of the file descriptor, which will be at least 10. The new
file descriptor can be written to using the syntax
&gt;&amp;$myfd.</p>

<p>The syntax {varid}&gt;&amp;-, for example
{myfd}&gt;&amp;-, may be used to close a file descriptor
opened in this fashion. Note that the parameter given by
varid must previously be set to a file descriptor in this
case.</p>

<p>It is an error to open or close a file descriptor in
this fashion when the parameter is readonly. However, it is
not an error to read or write a file descriptor using
&lt;&amp;$param or &gt;&amp;$param if param is read-
only.</p>

<p>If the option CLOBBER is unset, it is an error to open a
file descrip- tor using a parameter that is already set to
an open file descriptor previously allocated by this
mechanism. Unsetting the parameter before using it for
allocating a file descriptor avoids the error.</p>

<p>Note that this mechanism merely allocates or closes a
file descriptor; it does not perform any redirections from
or to it. It is usually con- venient to allocate a file
descriptor prior to use as an argument to exec. The
following shows a typical sequence of allocation, use, and
closing of a file descriptor:</p>

<p>integer myfd exec {myfd}&gt;~/logs/mylogfile.txt print
This is a log message. &gt;&amp;$myfd exec
{myfd}&gt;&amp;-</p>

<p>Note that the expansion of the variable in the
expression &gt;&amp;$myfd occurs at the point the
redirection is opened. This is after the expansion of
command arguments and after any redirections to the left on
the command line have been processed.</p>

<p>The |&amp; command separator described in Simple
Commands &amp; Pipelines in zshmisc(1) is a shorthand for
2&gt;&amp;1 |.</p>

<p>The various forms of process substitution, &lt;(list) ,
and =(list()) for input and &gt;(list) for output, are often
used together with redi- rection. For example, if word in an
output redirection is of the form &gt;(list) then the output
is piped to the command represented by list. See Process
Substitution in zshexpn(1).</p>

<p>MULTIOS If the user tries to open a file descriptor for
writing more than once, the shell opens the file descriptor
as a pipe to a process that copies its input to all the
specified outputs, similar to tee, provided the MULTIOS
option is set, as it is by default. Thus:</p>

<p>date &gt;foo &gt;bar</p>

<p>writes the date to two files, named foo and bar. Note
that a pipe is an implicit redirection; thus</p>

<p>date &gt;foo | cat</p>

<p>writes the date to the file foo, and also pipes it to
cat.</p>

<p>If the MULTIOS option is set, the word after a
redirection operator is also subjected to filename
generation (globbing). Thus</p>

<p>: &gt; *</p>

<p>will truncate all files in the current directory,
assuming theres at least one. (Without the MULTIOS option,
it would create an empty file called *.) Similarly, you can
do</p>

<p>echo exit 0 &gt;&gt; *.sh</p>

<p>If the user tries to open a file descriptor for reading
more than once, the shell opens the file descriptor as a
pipe to a process that copies all the specified inputs to
its output in the order specified, similar to cat, provided
the MULTIOS option is set. Thus</p>

<p>sort &lt;foo &lt;fubar</p>

<p>or even</p>

<p>sort &lt;f{oo,ubar}</p>

<p>is equivalent to cat foo fubar | sort.</p>

<p>Expansion of the redirection argument occurs at the
point the redirec- tion is opened, at the point described
above for the expansion of the variable in
&gt;&amp;$myfd.</p>

<p>Note that a pipe is an implicit redirection; thus</p>

<p>cat bar | sort &lt;foo</p>

<p>is equivalent to cat bar foo | sort (note the order of
the inputs).</p>

<p>If the MULTIOS option is unset, each redirection
replaces the previous redirection for that file descriptor.
However, all files redirected to are actually opened, so</p>

<p>echo foo &gt; bar &gt; baz</p>

<p>when MULTIOS is unset will truncate bar, and write foo
into baz.</p>

<p>There is a problem when an output multio is attached to
an external program. A simple example shows this:</p>

<p>cat file &gt;file1 &gt;file2 cat file1 file2</p>

<p>Here, it is possible that the second cat will not
display the full contents of file1 and file2 (i.e. the
original contents of file repeated twice).</p>

<p>The reason for this is that the multios are spawned
after the cat pro- cess is forked from the parent shell, so
the parent shell does not wait for the multios to finish
writing data. This means the command as shown can exit
before file1 and file2 are completely written. As a
workaround, it is possible to run the cat process as part of
a job in the current shell:</p>

<p>{ cat file } &gt;file &gt;file2</p>

<p>Here, the {...} job will pause to wait for both files to
be written.</p>

<p>REDIRECTIONS WITH NO COMMAND When a simple command
consists of one or more redirection operators and zero or
more parameter assignments, but no command name, zsh can
behave in several ways.</p>

<p>If the parameter NULLCMD is not set or the option
CSH_NULLCMD is set, an error is caused. This is the csh
behavior and CSH_NULLCMD is set by default when emulating
csh.</p>

<p>If the option SH_NULLCMD is set, the builtin : is
inserted as a com- mand with the given redirections. This is
the default when emulating sh or ksh.</p>

<p>Otherwise, if the parameter NULLCMD is set, its value
will be used as a command with the given redirections. If
both NULLCMD and READNULLCMD are set, then the value of the
latter will be used instead of that of the former when the
redirection is an input. The default for NULLCMD is cat and
for READNULLCMD is more. Thus</p>

<p>&lt; file</p>

<p>shows the contents of file on standard output, with
paging if that is a terminal. NULLCMD and READNULLCMD may
refer to shell functions.</p>

<p>COMMAND EXECUTION If a command name contains no slashes,
the shell attempts to locate it. If there exists a shell
function by that name, the function is invoked as described
in the section Functions . If there exists a shell builtin
by that name, the builtin is invoked.</p>

<p>Otherwise, the shell searches each element of $path for
a directory containing an executable file by that name. If
the search is unsuc- cessful, the shell prints an error
message and returns a nonzero exit status.</p>

<p>If execution fails because the file is not in executable
format, and the file is not a directory, it is assumed to be
a shell script. /bin/sh is spawned to execute it. If the
program is a file beginning with #! , the remainder of the
first line specifies an interpreter for the program. The
shell will execute the specified interpreter on oper- ating
systems that do not handle this executable format in the
kernel.</p>

<p>If no external command is found but a function
command_not_found_han- dler exists the shell executes this
function with all command line arguments. The function
should return status zero if it successfully handled the
command, or non-zero status if it failed. In the latter case
the standard handling is applied: command not found is
printed to standard error and the shell exits with status
127. Note that the handler is executed in a subshell forked
to execute an external com- mand, hence changes to
directories, shell parameters, etc. have no effect on the
main shell.</p>

<p>FUNCTIONS Shell functions are defined with the function
reserved word or the spe- cial syntax funcname (). Shell
functions are read in and stored internally. Alias names are
resolved when the function is read. Func- tions are executed
like commands with the arguments passed as posi- tional
parameters. (See the section Command Execution.)</p>

<p>Functions execute in the same process as the caller and
share all files and present working directory with the
caller. A trap on EXIT set inside a function is executed
after the function completes in the envi- ronment of the
caller.</p>

<p>The return builtin is used to return from function
calls.</p>

<p>Function identifiers can be listed with the functions
builtin. Func- tions can be undefined with the unfunction
builtin.</p>

<p>AUTOLOADING FUNCTIONS A function can be marked as
undefined using the autoload builtin (or functions -u or
typeset -fu). Such a function has no body. When the function
is first executed, the shell searches for its definition
using the elements of the fpath variable. Thus to define
functions for autoloading, a typical sequence is:</p>

<p>fpath=(~/myfuncs $fpath) autoload myfunc1 myfunc2
...</p>

<p>The usual alias expansion during reading will be
suppressed if the autoload builtin or its equivalent is
given the option -U. This is rec- ommended for the use of
functions supplied with the zsh distribution. Note that for
functions precompiled with the zcompile builtin command the
flag -U must be provided when the .zwc file is created, as
the cor- responding information is compiled into the
latter.</p>

<p>For each element in fpath, the shell looks for three
possible files, the newest of which is used to load the
definition for the function:</p>

<p>element.zwc A file created with the zcompile builtin
command, which is expected to contain the definitions for
all functions in the directory named element. The file is
treated in the same manner as a directory containing files
for functions and is searched for the definition of the
function. If the definition is not found, the search for a
definition proceeds with the other two possibilities
described below.</p>

<p>If element already includes a .zwc extension (i.e. the
extension was explicitly given by the user), element is
searched for the definition of the function without
comparing its age to that of other files; in fact, there
does not need to be any directory named element without the
suffix. Thus including an element such as
/usr/local/funcs.zwc in fpath will speed up the search for
functions, with the disadvantage that functions included
must be explicitly recompiled by hand before the shell
notices any changes.</p>

<p>element/function.zwc A file created with zcompile, which
is expected to contain the definition for function. It may
include other function defini- tions as well, but those are
neither loaded nor executed; a file found in this way is
searched only for the definition of func- tion.</p>

<p>element/function A file of zsh command text, taken to be
the definition for func- tion.</p>

<p>In summary, the order of searching is, first, in the
parents of direc- tories in fpath for the newer of either a
compiled directory or a directory in fpath; second, if more
than one of these contains a defi- nition for the function
that is sought, the leftmost in the fpath is chosen; and
third, within a directory, the newer of either a compiled
function or an ordinary function definition is used.</p>

<p>If the KSH_AUTOLOAD option is set, or the file contains
only a simple definition of the function, the files contents
will be executed. This will normally define the function in
question, but may also perform initialization, which is
executed in the context of the function execu- tion, and may
therefore define local parameters. It is an error if the
function is not defined by loading the file.</p>

<p>Otherwise, the function body (with no surrounding
funcname() {...}) is taken to be the complete contents of
the file. This form allows the file to be used directly as
an executable shell script. If processing of the file
results in the function being re-defined, the function
itself is not re-executed. To force the shell to perform
initializa- tion and then call the function defined, the
file should contain ini- tialization code (which will be
executed then discarded) in addition to a complete function
definition (which will be retained for subsequent calls to
the function), and a call to the shell function, including
any arguments, at the end.</p>

<p>For example, suppose the autoload file func contains</p>

<p>func() { print This is func; } print func is
initialized</p>

<p>then func; func with KSH_AUTOLOAD set will produce both
messages on the first call, but only the message This is
func on the second and subsequent calls. Without
KSH_AUTOLOAD set, it will produce the ini- tialization
message on the first call, and the other message on the
second and subsequent calls.</p>

<p>It is also possible to create a function that is not
marked as autoloaded, but which loads its own definition by
searching fpath, by using autoload -X within a shell
function. For example, the follow- ing are equivalent:</p>

<p>myfunc() { autoload -X } myfunc args...</p>

<p>and</p>

<p>unfunction myfunc # if myfunc was defined autoload
myfunc myfunc args...</p>

<p>In fact, the functions command outputs builtin autoload
-X as the body of an autoloaded function. This is done so
that</p>

<p>eval &quot;$(functions)&quot;</p>

<p>produces a reasonable result. A true autoloaded function
can be iden- tified by the presence of the comment #
undefined in the body, because all comments are discarded
from defined functions.</p>

<p>To load the definition of an autoloaded function myfunc
without execut- ing myfunc, use:</p>

<p>autoload +X myfunc</p>

<p>ANONYMOUS FUNCTIONS If no name is given for a function,
it is anonymous and is handled specially. Either form of
function definition may be used: a () with no preceding
name, or a function with an immediately following open
brace. The function is executed immediately at the point of
definition and is not stored for future use. The function
name is set to (anon) and the parameter list passed to the
function is empty. Note that this means the argument list of
any enclosing script or function is hidden. Redirections may
be applied to the anonymous function in the same man- ner as
to a current-shell structure enclosed in braces. The main
use of anonymous functions is to provide a scope for local
variables. This is particularly convenient in start-up files
as these do not provide their own local variable scope.</p>

<p>For example,</p>

<p>variable=outside function { local variable=inside print
&quot;I am $variable&quot; } print &quot;I am
$variable&quot;</p>

<p>outputs the following:</p>

<p>I am inside I am outside</p>

<p>Note that function definitions with arguments that
expand to nothing, for example name=; function $name { ...
}, are not treated as anony- mous functions. Instead, they
are treated as normal function defini- tions where the
definition is silently discarded.</p>

<p>SPECIAL FUNCTIONS Certain functions, if defined, have
special meaning to the shell.</p>

<p>Hook Functions For the functions below, it is possible
to define an array that has the same name as the function
with _functions appended. Any element in such an array is
taken as the name of a function to execute; it is exe- cuted
in the same context and with the same arguments as the basic
function. For example, if $chpwd_functions is an array
containing the values mychpwd, chpwd_save_dirstack, then the
shell attempts to execute the functions chpwd , mychpwd and
chpwd_save_dirstack, in that order. Any function that does
not exist is silently ignored. A function found by this
mechanism is referred to elsewhere as a hook function. An
error in any function causes subsequent functions not to be
run. Note further that an error in a precmd hook causes an
immedi- ately following periodic function not to run (though
it may run at the next opportunity).</p>

<p>chpwd Executed whenever the current working directory is
changed.</p>

<p>periodic If the parameter PERIOD is set, this function
is executed every $PERIOD seconds, just before a prompt.
Note that if multiple functions are defined using the array
periodic_functions only one period is applied to the
complete set of functions, and the scheduled time is not
reset if the list of functions is altered. Hence the set of
functions is always called together.</p>

<p>precmd Executed before each prompt. Note that precommand
functions are not re-executed simply because the command
line is redrawn, as happens, for example, when a
notification about an exiting job is displayed.</p>

<p>preexec Executed just after a command has been read and
is about to be executed. If the history mechanism is active
(and the line was not discarded from the history buffer),
the string that the user typed is passed as the first
argument, otherwise it is an empty string. The actual
command that will be executed (including expanded aliases)
is passed in two different forms: the second argument is a
single-line, size-limited version of the command (with
things like function bodies elided); the third argument
contains the full text that is being executed.</p>

<p>zshaddhistory Executed when a history line has been read
interactively, but before it is executed. The sole argument
is the complete his- tory line (so that any terminating
newline will still be present).</p>

<p>If any of the hook functions return a non-zero value the
history line will not be saved, although it lingers in the
history until the next line is executed allow you to reuse
or edit it immedi- ately.</p>

<p>A hook function may call fc -p ... to switch the history
con- text so that the history is saved in a different file
from the that in the global HISTFILE parameter. This is
handled spe- cially: the history context is automatically
restored after the processing of the history line is
finished.</p>

<p>The following example function first adds the history
line to the normal history with the newline stripped, which
is usually the correct behaviour. Then it switches the
history context so that the line will be written to a
history file in the current directory.</p>

<p>zshaddhistory() { print -sr -- ${1%%} fc -p
.zsh_local_history }</p>

<p>zshexit Executed at the point where the main shell is
about to exit nor- mally. This is not called by exiting
subshells, nor when the exec precommand modifier is used
before an external command. Also, unlike TRAPEXIT, it is not
called when functions exit.</p>

<p>Trap Functions The functions below are treated specially
but do not have corresponding hook arrays.</p>

<p>TRAPNAL If defined and non-null, this function will be
executed whenever the shell catches a signal SIGNAL, where
NAL is a signal name as specified for the kill builtin. The
signal number will be passed as the first parameter to the
function.</p>

<p>If a function of this form is defined and null, the
shell and processes spawned by it will ignore SIGNAL.</p>

<p>The return status from the function is handled
specially. If it is zero, the signal is assumed to have been
handled, and execu- tion continues normally. Otherwise, the
shell will behave as interrupted except that the return
status of the trap is retained.</p>

<p>Programs terminated by uncaught signals typically return
the status 128 plus the signal number. Hence the following
causes the handler for SIGINT to print a message, then mimic
the usual effect of the signal.</p>

<p>TRAPINT() { print &quot;Caught SIGINT, aborting.&quot;
return $(( 128 + $1 )) }</p>

<p>The functions TRAPZERR, TRAPDEBUG and TRAPEXIT are never
exe- cuted inside other traps.</p>

<p>TRAPDEBUG If the option DEBUG_BEFORE_CMD is set (as it
is by default), executed before each command; otherwise
executed after each com- mand. See the description of the
trap builtin in zshbuiltins(1) for details of additional
features provided in debug traps.</p>

<p>TRAPEXIT Executed when the shell exits, or when the
current function exits if defined inside a function. The
value of $? at the start of execution is the exit status of
the shell or the return status of the function exiting.</p>

<p>TRAPZERR Executed whenever a command has a non-zero exit
status. How- ever, the function is not executed if the
command occurred in a sublist followed by &amp;&amp; or ||;
only the final command in a sublist of this type causes the
trap to be executed. The func- tion TRAPERR acts the same as
TRAPZERR on systems where there is no SIGERR (this is the
usual case).</p>

<p>The functions beginning TRAP may alternatively be
defined with the trap builtin: this may be preferable for
some uses, as they are then run in the environment of the
calling process, rather than in their own function
environment. Apart from the difference in calling procedure
and the fact that the function form appears in lists of
functions, the forms</p>

<p>TRAPNAL() { # code }</p>

<p>and</p>

<p>trap # code NAL</p>

<p>are equivalent.</p>

<p>JOBS If the MONITOR option is set, an interactive shell
associates a job with each pipeline. It keeps a table of
current jobs, printed by the jobs command, and assigns them
small integer numbers. When a job is started asynchronously
with &amp;, the shell prints a line to standard error which
looks like:</p>

<p>[1] 1234</p>

<p>indicating that the job which was started asynchronously
was job number 1 and had one (top-level) process, whose
process ID was 1234.</p>

<p>If a job is started with &amp;| or &amp;!, then that job
is immediately disowned. After startup, it does not have a
place in the job table, and is not subject to the job
control features described here.</p>

<p>If you are running a job and wish to do something else
you may hit the key ^Z (control-Z) which sends a TSTP signal
to the current job: this key may be redefined by the susp
option of the external stty command. The shell will then
normally indicate that the job has been sus- pended , and
print another prompt. You can then manipulate the state of
this job, putting it in the background with the bg command,
or run some other commands and then eventually bring the job
back into the foreground with the foreground command fg. A
^Z takes effect immedi- ately and is like an interrupt in
that pending output and unread input are discarded when it
is typed.</p>

<p>A job being run in the background will suspend if it
tries to read from the terminal. Background jobs are
normally allowed to produce output, but this can be disabled
by giving the command stty tostop . If you set this tty
option, then background jobs will suspend when they try to
produce output like they do when they try to read input.</p>

<p>When a command is suspended and continued later with the
fg or wait builtins, zsh restores tty modes that were in
effect when it was sus- pended. This (intentionally) does
not apply if the command is contin- ued via kill -CONT, nor
when it is continued with bg.</p>

<p>There are several ways to refer to jobs in the shell. A
job can be referred to by the process ID of any process of
the job or by one of the following:</p>

<p>%number The job with the given number. %string Any job
whose command line begins with string. %?string Any job
whose command line contains string. %% Current job. %+
Equivalent to %%. %- Previous job.</p>

<p>The shell learns immediately whenever a process changes
state. It nor- mally informs you whenever a job becomes
blocked so that no further progress is possible. If the
NOTIFY option is not set, it waits until just before it
prints a prompt before it informs you. All such notifi-
cations are sent directly to the terminal, not to the
standard output or standard error.</p>

<p>When the monitor mode is on, each background job that
completes trig- gers any trap set for CHLD.</p>

<p>When you try to leave the shell while jobs are running
or suspended, you will be warned that You have suspended
(running) jobs. You may use the jobs command to see what
they are. If you do this or immedi- ately try to exit again,
the shell will not warn you a second time; the suspended
jobs will be terminated, and the running jobs will be sent a
SIGHUP signal, if the HUP option is set.</p>

<p>To avoid having the shell terminate the running jobs,
either use the nohup command (see nohup(1)) or the disown
builtin.</p>

<p>SIGNALS The INT and QUIT signals for an invoked command
are ignored if the com- mand is followed by &amp; and the
MONITOR option is not active. The shell itself always
ignores the QUIT signal. Otherwise, signals have the values
inherited by the shell from its parent (but see the TRAPNAL
special functions in the section Functions).</p>

<p>ARITHMETIC EVALUATION The shell can perform integer and
floating point arithmetic, either using the builtin let, or
via a substitution of the form $((...)). For integers, the
shell is usually compiled to use 8-byte precision where this
is available, otherwise precision is 4 bytes. This can be
tested, for example, by giving the command print - $((
12345678901 )); if the number appears unchanged, the
precision is at least 8 bytes. Floating point arithmetic
always uses the double type with whatever corre- sponding
precision is provided by the compiler and the library.</p>

<p>The let builtin command takes arithmetic expressions as
arguments; each is evaluated separately. Since many of the
arithmetic operators, as well as spaces, require quoting, an
alternative form is provided: for any command which begins
with a ((, all the characters until a match- ing )) are
treated as a quoted expression and arithmetic expansion
performed as for an argument of let. More precisely, ((...))
is equivalent to let &quot;...&quot;. The return status is 0
if the arithmetic value of the expression is non-zero, 1 if
it is zero, and 2 if an error occurred.</p>

<p>For example, the following statement</p>

<p>(( val = 2 + 1 ))</p>

<p>is equivalent to</p>

<p>let &quot;val = 2 + 1&quot;</p>

<p>both assigning the value 3 to the shell variable val and
returning a zero status.</p>

<p>Integers can be in bases other than 10. A leading 0x or
0X denotes hexadecimal. Integers may also be of the form
base#n , where base is a decimal number between two and
thirty-six representing the arithmetic base and n is a
number in that base (for example, 16#ff is 255 in
hexadecimal). The base# may also be omitted, in which case
base 10 is used. For backwards compatibility the form
[base]n is also accepted.</p>

<p>It is also possible to specify a base to be used for
output in the form [#base] , for example [#16] . This is
used when outputting arith- metical substitutions or when
assigning to scalar parameters, but an explicitly defined
integer or floating point parameter will not be affected. If
an integer variable is implicitly defined by an arith- metic
expression, any base specified in this way will be set as
the variable s output arithmetic base as if the option -i
base to the typeset builtin had been used. The expression
has no precedence and if it occurs more than once in a
mathematical expression, the last encoun- tered is used. For
clarity it is recommended that it appear at the beginning of
an expression. As an example:</p>

<p>typeset -i 16 y print $(( [#8] x = 32, y = 32 )) print
$x $y</p>

<p>outputs first 8#40 , the rightmost value in the given
output base, and then 8#40 16#20, because y has been
explicitly declared to have out- put base 16, while x
(assuming it does not already exist) is implicitly typed by
the arithmetic evaluation, where it acquires the output base
8.</p>

<p>If the C_BASES option is set, hexadecimal numbers in the
standard C format, for example 0xFF instead of the usual
16#FF . If the option OCTAL_ZEROES is also set (it is not by
default), octal numbers will be treated similarly and hence
appear as 077 instead of 8#77. This option has no effect on
the output of bases other than hexadecimal and octal, and
these formats are always understood on input.</p>

<p>When an output base is specified using the [#base]
syntax, an appro- priate base prefix will be output if
necessary, so that the value out- put is valid syntax for
input. If the # is doubled, for example [##16], then no base
prefix is output.</p>

<p>Floating point constants are recognized by the presence
of a decimal point or an exponent. The decimal point may be
the first character of the constant, but the exponent
character e or E may not, as it will be taken for a
parameter name.</p>

<p>An arithmetic expression uses nearly the same syntax and
associativity of expressions as in C.</p>

<p>In the native mode of operation, the following operators
are supported (listed in decreasing order of
precedence):</p>

<p>+ - ! ~ ++ -- unary plus/minus, logical NOT, complement,
{pre,post}{in,de}cre- ment &lt;&lt; &gt;&gt; bitwise shift
left, right &amp; bitwise AND ^ bitwise XOR | bitwise OR **
exponentiation * / % multiplication, division, modulus
(remainder) + - addition, subtraction &lt; &gt; &lt;= &gt;=
comparison == != equality and inequality &amp;&amp; logical
AND || ^^ logical OR, XOR ? : ternary operator = += -= *= /=
%= &amp;= ^= |= &lt;&lt;= &gt;&gt;= &amp;&amp;= ||= ^^= **=
assignment , comma operator</p>

<p>The operators &amp;&amp; , || , &amp;&amp;= , and ||=
are short-circuiting, and only one of the latter two
expressions in a ternary operator is evalu- ated. Note the
precedence of the bitwise AND, OR, and XOR operators.</p>

<p>With the option C_PRECEDENCES the precedences (but no
other properties) of the operators are altered to be the
same as those in most other lan- guages that support the
relevant operators:</p>

<p>+ - ! ~ ++ -- unary plus/minus, logical NOT, complement,
{pre,post}{in,de}cre- ment ** exponentiation * / %
multiplication, division, modulus (remainder) + - addition,
subtraction &lt;&lt; &gt;&gt; bitwise shift left, right &lt;
&gt; &lt;= &gt;= comparison == != equality and inequality
&amp; bitwise AND ^ bitwise XOR | bitwise OR &amp;&amp;
logical AND ^^ logical XOR || logical OR ? : ternary
operator = += -= *= /= %= &amp;= ^= |= &lt;&lt;= &gt;&gt;=
&amp;&amp;= ||= ^^= **= assignment , comma operator</p>

<p>Note the precedence of exponentiation in both cases is
below that of unary operators, hence -3**2 evaluates as 9,
not -9. Use parenthe- ses where necessary: -(3**2). This is
for compatibility with other shells.</p>

<p>Mathematical functions can be called with the syntax
func(args), where the function decides if the args is used
as a string or a comma-separated list of arithmetic
expressions. The shell currently defines no mathematical
functions by default, but the module zsh/math- func may be
loaded with the zmodload builtin to provide standard float-
ing point mathematical functions.</p>

<p>An expression of the form ##x where x is any character
sequence such as a, ^A, or M-x gives the value of this
character and an expression of the form #foo gives the value
of the first character of the contents of the parameter foo.
Character values are according to the character set used in
the current locale; for multibyte character handling the
option MULTIBYTE must be set. Note that this form is
different from $#foo, a standard parameter substitution
which gives the length of the parameter foo. #is accepted
instead of ##, but its use is deprecated.</p>

<p>Named parameters and subscripted arrays can be
referenced by name within an arithmetic expression without
using the parameter expansion syntax. For example,</p>

<p>((val2 = val1 * 2))</p>

<p>assigns twice the value of $val1 to the parameter named
val2.</p>

<p>An internal integer representation of a named parameter
can be speci- fied with the integer builtin. Arithmetic
evaluation is performed on the value of each assignment to a
named parameter declared integer in this manner. Assigning a
floating point number to an integer results in rounding down
to the next integer.</p>

<p>Likewise, floating point numbers can be declared with
the float builtin; there are two types, differing only in
their output format, as described for the typeset builtin.
The output format can be bypassed by using arithmetic
substitution instead of the parameter substitution, i.e.
${float} uses the defined format, but $((float)) uses a
generic floating point format.</p>

<p>Promotion of integer to floating point values is
performed where neces- sary. In addition, if any operator
which requires an integer (~, &amp; , | , ^ , % , &lt;&lt;,
&gt;&gt; and their equivalents with assignment) is given a
floating point argument, it will be silently rounded down to
the next integer.</p>

<p>Scalar variables can hold integer or floating point
values at different times; there is no memory of the numeric
type in this case.</p>

<p>If a variable is first assigned in a numeric context
without previously being declared, it will be implicitly
typed as integer or float and retain that type either until
the type is explicitly changed or until the end of the
scope. This can have unforeseen consequences. For example,
in the loop</p>

<p>for (( f = 0; f &lt; 1; f += 0.1 )); do # use $f
done</p>

<p>if f has not already been declared, the first assignment
will cause it to be created as an integer, and consequently
the operation f += 0.1 will always cause the result to be
truncated to zero, so that the loop will fail. A simple fix
would be to turn the initialization into f = 0.0 . It is
therefore best to declare numeric variables with explicit
types.</p>

<p>CONDITIONAL EXPRESSIONS A conditional expression is used
with the [[ compound command to test attributes of files and
to compare strings. Each expression can be constructed from
one or more of the following unary or binary expres-
sions:</p>

<p>-a file true if file exists.</p>

<p>-b file true if file exists and is a block special
file.</p>

<p>-c file true if file exists and is a character special
file.</p>

<p>-d file true if file exists and is a directory.</p>

<p>-e file true if file exists.</p>

<p>-f file true if file exists and is a regular file.</p>

<p>-g file true if file exists and has its setgid bit
set.</p>

<p>-h file true if file exists and is a symbolic link.</p>

<p>-k file true if file exists and has its sticky bit
set.</p>

<p>-n string true if length of string is non-zero.</p>

<p>-o option true if option named option is on. option may
be a single char- acter, in which case it is a single letter
option name. (See the section Specifying Options.)</p>

<p>-p file true if file exists and is a FIFO special file
(named pipe).</p>

<p>-r file true if file exists and is readable by current
process.</p>

<p>-s file true if file exists and has size greater than
zero.</p>

<p>-t fd true if file descriptor number fd is open and
associated with a terminal device. (note: fd is not
optional)</p>

<p>-u file true if file exists and has its setuid bit
set.</p>

<p>-w file true if file exists and is writable by current
process.</p>

<p>-x file true if file exists and is executable by current
process. If file exists and is a directory, then the current
process has permission to search in the directory.</p>

<p>-z string true if length of string is zero.</p>

<p>-L file true if file exists and is a symbolic link.</p>

<p>-O file true if file exists and is owned by the
effective user ID of this process.</p>

<p>-G file true if file exists and its group matches the
effective group ID of this process.</p>

<p>-S file true if file exists and is a socket.</p>

<p>-N file true if file exists and its access time is not
newer than its modification time.</p>

<p>file1 -nt file2 true if file1 exists and is newer than
file2.</p>

<p>file1 -ot file2 true if file1 exists and is older than
file2.</p>

<p>file1 -ef file2 true if file1 and file2 exist and refer
to the same file.</p>

<p>string = pattern string == pattern true if string
matches pattern. The == form is the preferred one. The =
form is for backward compatibility and should be considered
obsolete.</p>

<p>string != pattern true if string does not match
pattern.</p>

<p>string =~ regexp true if string matches the regular
expression regexp. If the option RE_MATCH_PCRE is set regexp
is tested as a PCRE regular expression using the zsh/pcre
module, else it is tested as a POSIX extended regular
expression using the zsh/regex module. Upon successful
match, some variables will be updated; no vari- ables are
changed if the matching fails. If the option BASH_REMATCH is
set the array BASH_REMATCH is set to the sub- string that
matched the pattern followed by the substrings that matched
parenthesised subexpressions within the pattern; other-
wise, the scalar parameter MATCH is set to the substring
that matched the pattern and and the array match to the
substrings that matched parenthesised subexpressions.</p>

<p>string1 &lt; string2 true if string1 comes before
string2 based on ASCII value of their characters.</p>

<p>string1 &gt; string2 true if string1 comes after string2
based on ASCII value of their characters.</p>

<p>exp1 -eq exp2 true if exp1 is numerically equal to
exp2.</p>

<p>exp1 -ne exp2 true if exp1 is numerically not equal to
exp2.</p>

<p>exp1 -lt exp2 true if exp1 is numerically less than
exp2.</p>

<p>exp1 -gt exp2 true if exp1 is numerically greater than
exp2.</p>

<p>exp1 -le exp2 true if exp1 is numerically less than or
equal to exp2.</p>

<p>exp1 -ge exp2 true if exp1 is numerically greater than
or equal to exp2.</p>

<p>( exp ) true if exp is true.</p>

<p>! exp true if exp is false.</p>

<p>exp1 &amp;&amp; exp2 true if exp1 and exp2 are both
true.</p>

<p>exp1 || exp2 true if either exp1 or exp2 is true.</p>

<p>Normal shell expansion is performed on the file, string
and pattern arguments, but the result of each expansion is
constrained to be a sin- gle word, similar to the effect of
double quotes. However, pattern metacharacters are active
for the pattern arguments; the patterns are the same as
those used for filename generation, see zshexpn(1), but
there is no special behaviour of / nor initial dots, and no
glob qualifiers are allowed.</p>

<p>In each of the above expressions, if file is of the form
/dev/fd/n, where n is an integer, then the test applied to
the open file whose descriptor number is n, even if the
underlying system does not support the /dev/fd
directory.</p>

<p>In the forms which do numeric comparison, the
expressions exp undergo arithmetic expansion as if they were
enclosed in $((...)).</p>

<p>For example, the following:</p>

<p>[[ ( -f foo || -f bar ) &amp;&amp; $report = y* ]]
&amp;&amp; print File exists.</p>

<p>tests if either file foo or file bar exists, and if so,
if the value of the parameter report begins with y; if the
complete condition is true, the message File exists. is
printed.</p>

<p>EXPANSION OF PROMPT SEQUENCES Prompt sequences undergo a
special form of expansion. This type of expansion is also
available using the -P option to the print builtin.</p>

<p>If the PROMPT_SUBST option is set, the prompt string is
first subjected to parameter expansion, command substitution
and arithmetic expansion. See zshexpn(1).</p>

<p>Certain escape sequences may be recognised in the prompt
string.</p>

<p>If the PROMPT_BANG option is set, a ! in the prompt is
replaced by the current history event number. A literal !
may then be repre- sented as !!.</p>

<p>If the PROMPT_PERCENT option is set, certain escape
sequences that start with % are expanded. Many escapes are
followed by a single character, although some of these take
an optional integer argument that should appear between the
% and the next character of the sequence. More complicated
escape sequences are available to provide conditional
expansion.</p>

<p>SIMPLE PROMPT ESCAPES Special characters %% A %.</p>

<p>%) A ).</p>

<p>Login information %l The line (tty) the user is logged
in on, without /dev/ prefix. If the name starts with
/dev/tty, that prefix is stripped.</p>

<p>%M The full machine hostname.</p>

<p>%m The hostname up to the first . . An integer may
follow the % to specify how many components of the hostname
are desired. With a negative integer, trailing components of
the hostname are shown.</p>

<p>%n $USERNAME.</p>

<p>%y The line (tty) the user is logged in on, without
/dev/ prefix. This does not treat /dev/tty names
specially.</p>

<p>Shell state %# A # if the shell is running with
privileges, a % if not. Equivalent to %(!.#.%%) . The
definition of privileged, for these purposes, is that either
the effective user ID is zero, or, if POSIX.1e capabilities
are supported, that at least one capability is raised in
either the Effective or Inheritable capability vectors.</p>

<p>%? The return status of the last command executed just
before the prompt.</p>

<p>%_ The status of the parser, i.e. the shell constructs
(like if and for ) that have been started on the command
line. If given an integer number that many strings will be
printed; zero or negative or no integer means print as many
as there are. This is most useful in prompts PS2 for
continuation lines and PS4 for debugging with the XTRACE
option; in the latter case it will also work
non-interactively.</p>

<p>%d %/ Present working directory ($PWD). If an integer
follows the %, it specifies a number of trailing components
of $PWD to show; zero means the whole path. A negative
integer specifies leading components, i.e. %-1d specifies
the first component.</p>

<p>%~ As %d and %/, but if $PWD has a named directory as
its prefix, that part is replaced by a ~ followed by the
name of the directory. If it starts with $HOME, that part is
replaced by a ~.</p>

<p>%h %! Current history event number.</p>

<p>%i The line number currently being executed in the
script, sourced file, or shell function given by %N. This is
most useful for debugging as part of $PS4.</p>

<p>%I The line number currently being executed in the file
%x. This is similar to %i, but the line number is always a
line number in the file where the code was defined, even if
the code is a shell function.</p>

<p>%j The number of jobs.</p>

<p>%L The current value of $SHLVL.</p>

<p>%N The name of the script, sourced file, or shell
function that zsh is currently executing, whichever was
started most recently. If there is none, this is equivalent
to the parameter $0. An inte- ger may follow the % to
specify a number of trailing path com- ponents to show; zero
means the full path. A negative integer specifies leading
components.</p>

<p>%x The name of the file containing the source code
currently being executed. This behaves as %N except that
function and eval com- mand names are not shown, instead the
file where they were defined.</p>

<p>%c %. %C Trailing component of $PWD. An integer may
follow the % to get more than one component. Unless %C is
used, tilde con- traction is performed first. These are
deprecated as %c and %C are equivalent to %1~ and %1/,
respectively, while explicit pos- itive integers have the
same effect as for the latter two sequences.</p>

<p>Date and time %D The date in yy-mm-dd format.</p>

<p>%T Current time of day, in 24-hour format.</p>

<p>%t %@ Current time of day, in 12-hour, am/pm format.</p>

<p>%* Current time of day in 24-hour format, with
seconds.</p>

<p>%w The date in day-dd format.</p>

<p>%W The date in mm/dd/yy format.</p>

<p>%D{string} string is formatted using the strftime
function. See strf- time(3) for more details. Various zsh
extensions provide num- bers with no leading zero or space
if the number is a single digit:</p>

<p>%f a day of the month %K the hour of the day on the
24-hour clock %L the hour of the day on the 12-hour
clock</p>

<p>The GNU extension that a - between the % and the format
char- acter causes a leading zero or space to be stripped is
handled directly by the shell for the format characters d,
f, H, k, l, m, M, S and y; any other format characters are
provided to strf- time() with any leading - , present, so
the handling is system dependent. Further GNU extensions are
not supported at present.</p>

<p>Visual effects %B (%b) Start (stop) boldface mode.</p>

<p>%E Clear to end of line.</p>

<p>%U (%u) Start (stop) underline mode.</p>

<p>%S (%s) Start (stop) standout mode.</p>

<p>%F (%f) Start (stop) using a different foreground
colour, if supported by the terminal. The colour may be
specified two ways: either as a numeric argument, as normal,
or by a sequence in braces following the %F, for example
%F{red}. In the latter case the values allowed are as
described for the fg zle_highlight attribute; see Character
Highlighting in zshzle(1). This means that numeric colours
are allowed in the second format also.</p>

<p>%K (%k) Start (stop) using a different bacKground
colour. The syntax is identical to that for %F and %f.</p>

<p>%{...%} Include a string as a literal escape sequence.
The string within the braces should not change the cursor
position. Brace pairs can nest.</p>

<p>A positive numeric argument between the % and the { is
treated as described for %G below.</p>

<p>%G Within a %{...%} sequence, include a glitch: that is,
assume that a single character width will be output. This is
useful when outputting characters that otherwise cannot be
correctly handled by the shell, such as the alternate
character set on some terminals. The characters in question
can be included within a %{...%} sequence together with the
appropriate number of %G sequences to indicate the correct
width. An integer between the % and G indicates a character
width other than one. Hence %{seq%2G%} outputs seq and
assumes it takes up the width of two standard
characters.</p>

<p>Multiple uses of %G accumulate in the obvious fashion;
the posi- tion of the %G is unimportant. Negative integers
are not han- dled.</p>

<p>Note that when prompt truncation is in use it is
advisable to divide up output into single characters within
each %{...%} group so that the correct truncation point can
be found.</p>

<p>CONDITIONAL SUBSTRINGS IN PROMPTS %v The value of the
first element of the psvar array parameter. Following the %
with an integer gives that element of the array. Negative
integers count from the end of the array.</p>

<p>%(x.true-text.false-text) Specifies a ternary
expression. The character following the x is arbitrary; the
same character is used to separate the text for the true
result from that for the false result. This separator may
not appear in the true-text, except as part of a %-escape
sequence. A ) may appear in the false-text as %). true-text
and false-text may both contain arbitrarily-nested escape
sequences, including further ternary expressions.</p>

<p>The left parenthesis may be preceded or followed by a
positive integer n, which defaults to zero. A negative
integer will be multiplied by -1. The test character x may
be any of the fol- lowing:</p>

<p>! True if the shell is running with privileges. # True
if the effective uid of the current process is n. ? True if
the exit status of the last command was n. _ True if at
least n shell constructs were started. C / True if the
current absolute path has at least n elements relative to
the root directory, hence / is counted as 0 elements. c . ~
True if the current path, with prefix replacement, has at
least n elements relative to the root directory, hence / is
counted as 0 elements. D True if the month is equal to n
(January = 0). d True if the day of the month is equal to n.
g True if the effective gid of the current process is n. j
True if the number of jobs is at least n. L True if the
SHLVL parameter is at least n. l True if at least n
characters have already been printed on the current line. S
True if the SECONDS parameter is at least n. T True if the
time in hours is equal to n. t True if the time in minutes
is equal to n. v True if the array psvar has at least n
elements. V True if element n of the array psvar is set and
non-empty. w True if the day of the week is equal to n
(Sunday = 0).</p>

<p>%&lt;string&lt; %&gt;string&gt; %[xstring] Specifies
truncation behaviour for the remainder of the prompt string.
The third, deprecated, form is equivalent to %xstringx ,
i.e. x may be &lt; or &gt;. The numeric argument, which in
the third form may appear immediately after the [, specifies
the maximum permitted length of the various strings that can
be displayed in the prompt. The string will be dis- played
in place of the truncated portion of any string; note this
does not undergo prompt expansion.</p>

<p>The forms with &lt; truncate at the left of the string,
and the forms with &gt; truncate at the right of the string.
For exam- ple, if the current directory is /home/pike , the
prompt %8&lt;..&lt;%/ will expand to ..e/pike. In this
string, the ter- minating character (&lt;, &gt; or ] ), or
in fact any character, may be quoted by a preceding; note
when using print -P, how- ever, that this must be doubled as
the string is also subject to standard print processing, in
addition to any backslashes removed by a double quoted
string: the worst case is therefore print -P
&quot;%&lt;&lt;...&quot;.</p>

<p>If the string is longer than the specified truncation
length, it will appear in full, completely replacing the
truncated string.</p>

<p>The part of the prompt string to be truncated runs to
the end of the string, or to the end of the next enclosing
group of the %( construct, or to the next truncation
encountered at the same grouping level (i.e. truncations
inside a %( are sepa- rate), which ever comes first. In
particular, a truncation with argument zero (e.g. %&lt;&lt;)
marks the end of the range of the string to be truncated
while turning off truncation from there on. For example, the
prompt %10&lt;...&lt;%~%&lt;&lt;%# will print a truncated
representation of the current directory, followed by a % or
#, followed by a space. Without the %&lt;&lt; , those two
characters would be included in the string to be truncated.
ZSHEXPN(1) ZSHEXPN(1)</p>

<p>NAME zshexpn - zsh expansion and substitution</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The following types of expansions are
performed in the indicated order in five steps:</p>

<p>History Expansion This is performed only in interactive
shells.</p>

<p>Alias Expansion Aliases are expanded immediately before
the command line is parsed as explained under Aliasing in
zshmisc(1).</p>

<p>Process Substitution Parameter Expansion Command
Substitution Arithmetic Expansion Brace Expansion These five
are performed in one step in left-to-right fashion. After
these expansions, all unquoted occurrences of the
characters, and &quot; are removed.</p>

<p>Filename Expansion If the SH_FILE_EXPANSION option is
set, the order of expansion is modified for compatibility
with sh and ksh. In that case filename expansion is
performed immediately after alias expan- sion, preceding the
set of five expansions mentioned above.</p>

<p>Filename Generation This expansion, commonly referred to
as globbing, is always done last.</p>

<p>The following sections explain the types of expansion in
detail.</p>

<p>HISTORY EXPANSION History expansion allows you to use
words from previous command lines in the command line you
are typing. This simplifies spelling correc- tions and the
repetition of complicated commands or arguments. Immedi-
ately before execution, each command is saved in the history
list, the size of which is controlled by the HISTSIZE
parameter. The one most recent command is always retained in
any case. Each saved command in the history list is called a
history event and is assigned a number, beginning with 1
(one) when the shell starts up. The history number that you
may see in your prompt (see EXPANSION OF PROMPT SEQUENCES in
zshmisc(1)) is the number that is to be assigned to the next
command.</p>

<p>Overview A history expansion begins with the first
character of the histchars parameter, which is ! by default,
and may occur anywhere on the com- mand line; history
expansions do not nest. The ! can be escaped with or can be
enclosed between a pair of single quotes ( ) to suppress its
special meaning. Double quotes will not work for this.
Following this history character is an optional event
designator (see the section Event Designators ) and then an
optional word designator (the section Word Designators); if
neither of these designators is present, no history
expansion occurs.</p>

<p>Input lines containing history expansions are echoed
after being expanded, but before any other expansions take
place and before the command is executed. It is this
expanded form that is recorded as the history event for
later references.</p>

<p>By default, a history reference with no event designator
refers to the same event as any preceding history reference
on that command line; if it is the only history reference in
a command, it refers to the previ- ous command. However, if
the option CSH_JUNKIE_HISTORY is set, then every history
reference with no event specification always refers to the
previous command.</p>

<p>For example, ! is the event designator for the previous
command, so !!:1 always refers to the first word of the
previous command, and !!$ always refers to the last word of
the previous command. With CSH_JUNKIE_HISTORY set, then !:1
and !$ function in the same manner as !!:1 and !!$ ,
respectively. Conversely, if CSH_JUNKIE_HISTORY is unset,
then !:1 and !$ refer to the first and last words,
respectively, of the same event referenced by the nearest
other history reference preceding them on the current
command line, or to the previ- ous command if there is no
preceding reference.</p>

<p>The character sequence ^foo^bar (where ^ is actually the
second character of the histchars parameter) repeats the
last command, replac- ing the string foo with bar. More
precisely, the sequence ^foo^bar^ is synonymous with
!!:s^foo^bar^, hence other modifiers (see the sec- tion
Modifiers ) may follow the final ^. In particular,
^foo^bar:G performs a global substitution.</p>

<p>If the shell encounters the character sequence !&quot;
in the input, the history mechanism is temporarily disabled
until the current list (see zshmisc(1)) is fully parsed. The
!&quot; is removed from the input, and any subsequent !
characters have no special significance.</p>

<p>A less convenient but more comprehensible form of
command history sup- port is provided by the fc builtin.</p>

<p>Event Designators An event designator is a reference to
a command-line entry in the his- tory list. In the list
below, remember that the initial ! in each item may be
changed to another character by setting the histchars
parameter.</p>

<p>! Start a history expansion, except when followed by a
blank, new- line, = or (. If followed immediately by a word
designator (see the section Word Designators), this forms a
history ref- erence with no event designator (see the
section Overview).</p>

<p>!! Refer to the previous command. By itself, this
expansion repeats the previous command.</p>

<p>!n Refer to command-line n.</p>

<p>!-n Refer to the current command-line minus n.</p>

<p>!str Refer to the most recent command starting with
str.</p>

<p>!?str[?] Refer to the most recent command containing
str. The trailing ? is necessary if this reference is to be
followed by a modi- fier or followed by any text that is not
to be considered part of str.</p>

<p>!# Refer to the current command line typed in so far.
The line is treated as if it were complete up to and
including the word before the one with the !# reference.</p>

<p>!{...} Insulate a history reference from adjacent
characters (if neces- sary).</p>

<p>Word Designators A word designator indicates which word
or words of a given command line are to be included in a
history reference. A : usually separates the event
specification from the word designator. It may be omitted
only if the word designator begins with a ^, $, *, - or %.
Word designators include:</p>

<p>0 The first input word (command). n The nth argument. ^
The first argument. That is, 1. $ The last argument. % The
word matched by (the most recent) ?str search. x-y A range
of words; x defaults to 0. * All the arguments, or a null
value if there are none. x* Abbreviates x-$. x- Like x* but
omitting word $.</p>

<p>Note that a % word designator works only when used in
one of !%, !:% or !?str?:%, and only when used after a !?
expansion (possibly in an earlier command). Anything else
results in an error, although the error may not be the most
obvious one.</p>

<p>Modifiers After the optional word designator, you can
add a sequence of one or more of the following modifiers,
each preceded by a : . These modi- fiers also work on the
result of filename generation and parameter expansion,
except where noted.</p>

<p>a Turn a file name into an absolute path: prepends the
current directory, if necessary, and resolves any use of ..
and . in the path. Note that the transformation takes place
even if the file or any intervening directories do not
exist.</p>

<p>A As a , but also resolve use of symbolic links where
possible. Note that resolution of .. occurs before
resolution of sym- bolic links. This call is equivalent to a
unless your system has the realpath system call (modern
systems do).</p>

<p>c Resolve a command name into an absolute path by
searching the command path given by the PATH variable. This
does not work for commands containing directory parts. Note
also that this does not usually work as a glob qualifier
unless a file of the same name is found in the current
directory.</p>

<p>e Remove all but the extension.</p>

<p>h Remove a trailing pathname component, leaving the
head. This works like dirname.</p>

<p>l Convert the words to all lowercase.</p>

<p>p Print the new command but do not execute it. Only
works with history expansion.</p>

<p>q Quote the substituted words, escaping further
substitutions. Works with history expansion and parameter
expansion, though for parameters it is only useful if the
resulting text is to be re-evaluated such as by eval.</p>

<p>Q Remove one level of quotes from the substituted
words.</p>

<p>r Remove a filename extension of the form .xxx , leaving
the root name.</p>

<p>s/l/r[/] Substitute r for l as described below. The
substitution is done only for the first string that matches
l. For arrays and for filename generation, this applies to
each word of the expanded text. See below for further notes
on substitutions.</p>

<p>The forms gs/l/r and s/l/r/:G perform global
substitution, i.e. substitute every occurrence of r for l.
Note that the g or :G must appear in exactly the position
shown.</p>

<p>&amp; Repeat the previous s substitution. Like s, may be
preceded immediately by a g. In parameter expansion the
&amp; must appear inside braces, and in filename generation
it must be quoted with a backslash.</p>

<p>t Remove all leading pathname components, leaving the
tail. This works like basename.</p>

<p>u Convert the words to all uppercase.</p>

<p>x Like q, but break into words at whitespace. Does not
work with parameter expansion.</p>

<p>The s/l/r/ substitution works as follows. By default the
left-hand side of substitutions are not patterns, but
character strings. Any character can be used as the
delimiter in place of /. A backslash quotes the delimiter
character. The character &amp;, in the right-hand-side r, is
replaced by the text from the left-hand-side l. The &amp;
can be quoted with a backslash. A null l uses the previous
string either from the previous l or from the contextual
scan string s from !?s . You can omit the rightmost
delimiter if a newline immedi- ately follows r; the
rightmost ? in a context scan can similarly be omitted. Note
the same record of the last l and r is maintained across all
forms of expansion.</p>

<p>If the option HIST_SUBST_PATTERN is set, l is treated as
a pattern of the usual form described in the section
FILENAME GENERATION below. This can be used in all the
places where modifiers are available; note, however, that in
globbing qualifiers parameter substitution has already taken
place, so parameters in the replacement string should be
quoted to ensure they are replaced at the correct time. Note
also that com- plicated patterns used in globbing qualifiers
may need the extended glob qualifier notation
(#q:s/.../.../) in order for the shell to rec- ognize the
expression as a glob qualifier. Further, note that bad pat-
terns in the substitution are not subject to the
NO_BAD_PATTERN option so will cause an error.</p>

<p>When HIST_SUBST_PATTERN is set, l may start with a # to
indicate that the pattern must match at the start of the
string to be substituted, and a % may appear at the start or
after an # to indicate that the pat- tern must match at the
end of the string to be substituted. The % or # may be
quoted with two backslashes.</p>

<p>For example, the following piece of filename generation
code with the EXTENDED_GLOB option:</p>

<p>print *.c(#q:s/#%(#b)s(*).cS${match[1]}./)</p>

<p>takes the expansion of *.c and applies the glob
qualifiers in the (#q...) expression, which consists of a
substitution modifier anchored to the start and end of each
word (#%). This turns on backreferences ((#b)), so that the
parenthesised subexpression is available in the replacement
string as ${match[1]}. The replacement string is quoted so
that the parameter is not substituted before the start of
filename gen- eration.</p>

<p>The following f, F, w and W modifiers work only with
parameter expan- sion and filename generation. They are
listed here to provide a single point of reference for all
modifiers.</p>

<p>f Repeats the immediately (without a colon) following
modifier until the resulting word doesnt change any
more.</p>

<p>F:expr: Like f, but repeats only n times if the
expression expr evalu- ates to n. Any character can be used
instead of the :; if (, [, or { is used as the opening
delimiter, the closing delimiter should be ), ], or },
respectively.</p>

<p>w Makes the immediately following modifier work on each
word in the string.</p>

<p>W:sep: Like w but words are considered to be the parts
of the string that are separated by sep. Any character can
be used instead of the :; opening parentheses are handled
specially, see above.</p>

<p>PROCESS SUBSTITUTION Each part of a command argument
that takes the form &lt;(list), &gt;(list) or =(list) is
subject to process substitution. The expres- sion may be
preceeded or followed by other strings except that, to pre-
vent clashes with commonly occurring strings and patterns,
the last form must occur at the start of a command argument,
and the forms are only expanded when first parsing command
or assignment arguments. Pro- cess substitutions may be used
following redirection operators; in this case, the
substitution must appear with no trailing string.</p>

<p>In the case of the &lt; or &gt; forms, the shell runs
the commands in list asynchronously. If the system supports
the /dev/fd mechanism, the com- mand argument is the name of
the device file corresponding to a file descriptor;
otherwise, if the system supports named pipes (FIFOs), the
command argument will be a named pipe. If the form with &gt;
is selected then writing on this special file will provide
input for list. If &lt; is used, then the file passed as an
argument will be connected to the out- put of the list
process. For example,</p>

<p>paste &lt;(cut -f1 file1) &lt;(cut -f3 file2) | tee
&gt;(process1) &gt;(process2) &gt;/dev/null</p>

<p>cuts fields 1 and 3 from the files file1 and file2
respectively, pastes the results together, and sends it to
the processes process1 and pro- cess2.</p>

<p>If =(...) is used instead of &lt;(...), then the file
passed as an argu- ment will be the name of a temporary file
containing the output of the list process. This may be used
instead of the &lt; form for a program that expects to lseek
(see lseek(2)) on the input file.</p>

<p>There is an optimisation for substitutions of the form
=(&lt;&lt;&lt;arg), where arg is a single-word argument to
the here-string redirection &lt;&lt;&lt;. This form produces
a file name containing the value of arg after any substi-
tutions have been performed. This is handled entirely within
the cur- rent shell. This is effectively the reverse of the
special form $(&lt;arg) which treats arg as a file name and
replaces it with the files contents.</p>

<p>The = form is useful as both the /dev/fd and the named
pipe implementa- tion of &lt;(...) have drawbacks. In the
former case, some programmes may automatically close the
file descriptor in question before examining the file on the
command line, particularly if this is necessary for security
reasons such as when the programme is running setuid. In the
second case, if the programme does not actually open the
file, the sub- shell attempting to read from or write to the
pipe will (in a typical implementation, different operating
systems may have different behaviour) block for ever and
have to be killed explicitly. In both cases, the shell
actually supplies the information using a pipe, so that
programmes that expect to lseek (see lseek(2)) on the file
will not work.</p>

<p>Also note that the previous example can be more
compactly and effi- ciently written (provided the MULTIOS
option is set) as:</p>

<p>paste &lt;(cut -f1 file1) &lt;(cut -f3 file2) &gt;
&gt;(process1) &gt; &gt;(process2)</p>

<p>The shell uses pipes instead of FIFOs to implement the
latter two pro- cess substitutions in the above example.</p>

<p>There is an additional problem with &gt;(process); when
this is attached to an external command, the parent shell
does not wait for process to finish and hence an immediately
following command cannot rely on the results being complete.
The problem and solution are the same as described in the
section MULTIOS in zshmisc(1). Hence in a simplified version
of the example above:</p>

<p>paste &lt;(cut -f1 file1) &lt;(cut -f3 file2) &gt;
&gt;(process)</p>

<p>(note that no MULTIOS are involved), process will be run
asyn- chronously. The workaround is:</p>

<p>{ paste &lt;(cut -f1 file1) &lt;(cut -f3 file2) } &gt;
&gt;(process)</p>

<p>The extra processes here are spawned from the parent
shell which will wait for their completion.</p>

<p>PARAMETER EXPANSION The character $ is used to introduce
parameter expansions. See zsh- param(1) for a description of
parameters, including arrays, associative arrays, and
subscript notation to access individual array elements.</p>

<p>Note in particular the fact that words of unquoted
parameters are not automatically split on whitespace unless
the option SH_WORD_SPLIT is set; see references to this
option below for more details. This is an important
difference from other shells.</p>

<p>In the expansions discussed below that require a
pattern, the form of the pattern is the same as that used
for filename generation; see the section Filename
Generation. Note that these patterns, along with the
replacement text of any substitutions, are themselves
subject to parameter expansion, command substitution, and
arithmetic expansion. In addition to the following
operations, the colon modifiers described in the section
Modifiers in the section History Expansion can be applied:
for example, ${i:s/foo/bar/} performs string substitution on
the expansion of parameter $i.</p>

<p>${name} The value, if any, of the parameter name is
substituted. The braces are required if the expansion is to
be followed by a let- ter, digit, or underscore that is not
to be interpreted as part of name. In addition, more
complicated forms of substitution usually require the braces
to be present; exceptions, which only apply if the option
KSH_ARRAYS is not set, are a single sub- script or any colon
modifiers appearing after the name, or any of the characters
^, =, ~, # or + appearing before the name, all of which work
with or without braces.</p>

<p>If name is an array parameter, and the KSH_ARRAYS option
is not set, then the value of each element of name is
substituted, one element per word. Otherwise, the expansion
results in one word only; with KSH_ARRAYS, this is the first
element of an array. No field splitting is done on the
result unless the SH_WORD_SPLIT option is set. See also the
flags = and s:string:.</p>

<p>${+name} If name is the name of a set parameter 1 is
substituted, oth- erwise 0 is substituted.</p>

<p>${name-word} ${name:-word} If name is set, or in the
second form is non-null, then substi- tute its value;
otherwise substitute word. In the second form name may be
omitted, in which case word is always substituted.</p>

<p>${name+word} ${name:+word} If name is set, or in the
second form is non-null, then substi- tute word; otherwise
substitute nothing.</p>

<p>${name=word} ${name:=word} ${name::=word} In the first
form, if name is unset then set it to word; in the second
form, if name is unset or null then set it to word; and in
the third form, unconditionally set name to word. In all
forms, the value of the parameter is then substituted.</p>

<p>${name?word} ${name:?word} In the first form, if name is
set, or in the second form if name is both set and non-null,
then substitute its value; otherwise, print word and exit
from the shell. Interactive shells instead return to the
prompt. If word is omitted, then a standard mes- sage is
printed.</p>

<p>In any of the above expressions that test a variable and
substitute an alternate word, note that you can use standard
shell quoting in the word value to selectively override the
splitting done by the SH_WORD_SPLIT option and the = flag,
but not splitting by the s:string: flag.</p>

<p>In the following expressions, when name is an array and
the substitu- tion is not quoted, or if the (@) flag or the
name[@] syntax is used, matching and replacement is
performed on each array element separately.</p>

<p>${name#pattern} ${name##pattern} If the pattern matches
the beginning of the value of name, then substitute the
value of name with the matched portion deleted; otherwise,
just substitute the value of name. In the first form, the
smallest matching pattern is preferred; in the second form,
the largest matching pattern is preferred.</p>

<p>${name%pattern} ${name%%pattern} If the pattern matches
the end of the value of name, then sub- stitute the value of
name with the matched portion deleted; oth- erwise, just
substitute the value of name. In the first form, the
smallest matching pattern is preferred; in the second form,
the largest matching pattern is preferred.</p>

<p>${name:#pattern} If the pattern matches the value of
name, then substitute the empty string; otherwise, just
substitute the value of name. If name is an array the
matching array elements are removed (use the (M) flag to
remove the non-matched elements).</p>

<p>${name/pattern/repl} ${name//pattern/repl} Replace the
longest possible match of pattern in the expansion of
parameter name by string repl. The first form replaces just
the first occurrence, the second form all occurrences. Both
pattern and repl are subject to double-quoted substitution,
so that expressions like ${name/$opat/$npat} will work, but
note the usual rule that pattern characters in $opat are not
treated specially unless either the option GLOB_SUBST is
set, or $opat is instead substituted as ${~opat}.</p>

<p>The pattern may begin with a #, in which case the
pattern must match at the start of the string, or %, in
which case it must match at the end of the string, or #% in
which case the pat- tern must match the entire string. The
repl may be an empty string, in which case the final / may
also be omitted. To quote the final / in other cases it
should be preceded by a single backslash; this is not
necessary if the / occurs inside a substituted parameter.
Note also that the #, % and #% are not active if they occur
inside a substituted parameter, even at the start.</p>

<p>The first / may be preceded by a :, in which case the
match will only succeed if it matches the entire word. Note
also the effect of the I and S parameter expansion flags
below; however, the flags M, R, B, E and N are not
useful.</p>

<p>For example,</p>

<p>foo=&quot;twinkle twinkle little star&quot;
sub=&quot;t*e&quot; rep=&quot;spy&quot; print
${foo//${~sub}/$rep} print ${(S)foo//${~sub}/$rep}</p>

<p>Here, the ~ ensures that the text of $sub is treated as
a pat- tern rather than a plain string. In the first case,
the longest match for t*e is substituted and the result is
spy star, while in the second case, the shortest matches are
taken and the result is spy spy lispy star.</p>

<p>${#spec} If spec is one of the above substitutions,
substitute the length in characters of the result instead of
the result itself. If spec is an array expression,
substitute the number of elements of the result. Note that
^, =, and ~, below, must appear to the left of # when these
forms are combined.</p>

<p>${^spec} Turn on the RC_EXPAND_PARAM option for the
evaluation of spec; if the ^ is doubled, turn it off. When
this option is set, array expansions of the form
foo${xx}bar, where the parameter xx is set to (a b c), are
substituted with fooabar foobbar foocbar instead of the
default fooa b cbar. Note that an empty array will therefore
cause all arguments to be removed.</p>

<p>Internally, each such expansion is converted into the
equivalent list for brace expansion. E.g., ${^var} becomes
{$var[1],$var[2],...}, and is processed as described in the
sec- tion Brace Expansion below. If word splitting is also
in effect the $var[N] may themselves be split into different
list elements.</p>

<p>${=spec} Perform word splitting using the rules for
SH_WORD_SPLIT during the evaluation of spec, but regardless
of whether the parameter appears in double quotes; if the =
is doubled, turn it off. This forces parameter expansions to
be split into separate words before substitution, using IFS
as a delimiter. This is done by default in most other
shells.</p>

<p>Note that splitting is applied to word in the assignment
forms of spec before the assignment to name is performed.
This affects the result of array assignments with the A
flag.</p>

<p>${~spec} Turn on the GLOB_SUBST option for the
evaluation of spec; if the ~ is doubled, turn it off. When
this option is set, the string resulting from the expansion
will be interpreted as a pattern anywhere that is possible,
such as in filename expansion and filename generation and
pattern-matching contexts like the right hand side of the =
and != operators in conditions.</p>

<p>In nested substitutions, note that the effect of the ~
applies to the result of the current level of substitution.
A surround- ing pattern operation on the result may cancel
it. Hence, for example, if the parameter foo is set to *,
${~foo/*/*.c} is substituted by the pattern *.c, which may
be expanded by file- name generation, but ${${~foo}/*/*.c}
substitutes to the string *.c, which will not be further
expanded.</p>

<p>If a ${...} type parameter expression or a $(...) type
command substi- tution is used in place of name above, it is
expanded first and the result is used as if it were the
value of name. Thus it is possible to perform nested
operations: ${${foo#head}%tail} substitutes the value of
$foo with both head and tail deleted. The form with $(...)
is often useful in combination with the flags described
next; see the examples below. Each name or nested ${...} in
a parameter expansion may also be followed by a subscript
expression as described in Array Parameters in
zshparam(1).</p>

<p>Note that double quotes may appear around nested
expressions, in which case only the part inside is treated
as quoted; for example, ${(f)&quot;$(foo)&quot;} quotes the
result of $(foo), but the flag (f) (see below) is applied
using the rules for unquoted expansions. Note fur- ther that
quotes are themselves nested in this context; for example,
in &quot;${(@f)&quot;$(foo)&quot;}&quot;, there are two sets
of quotes, one surrounding the whole expression, the other
(redundant) surrounding the $(foo) as before.</p>

<p>Parameter Expansion Flags If the opening brace is
directly followed by an opening parenthesis, the string up
to the matching closing parenthesis will be taken as a list
of flags. In cases where repeating a flag is meaningful, the
rep- etitions need not be consecutive; for example, (q%q%q)
means the same thing as the more readable (%%qqq). The
following flags are sup- ported:</p>

<p># Evaluate the resulting words as numeric expressions
and output the characters corresponding to the resulting
integer. Note that this form is entirely distinct from use
of the # without parentheses.</p>

<p>If the MULTIBYTE option is set and the number is greater
than 127 (i.e. not an ASCII character) it is treated as a
Unicode character.</p>

<p>% Expand all % escapes in the resulting words in the
same way as in prompts (see EXPANSION OF PROMPT SEQUENCES in
zshmisc(1)). If this flag is given twice, full prompt
expansion is done on the resulting words, depending on the
setting of the PROMPT_PERCENT, PROMPT_SUBST and PROMPT_BANG
options.</p>

<p>@ In double quotes, array elements are put into separate
words. E.g., &quot;${(@)foo}&quot; is equivalent to
&quot;${foo[@]}&quot; and &quot;${(@)foo[1,2]}&quot; is the
same as &quot;$foo[1]&quot; &quot;$foo[2]&quot;. This is
distinct from field splitting by the the f, s or z flags,
which still applies within each array element.</p>

<p>A Create an array parameter with ${...=...}, ${...:=...}
or ${...::=...}. If this flag is repeated (as in AA ),
create an associative array parameter. Assignment is made
before sort- ing or padding. The name part may be a
subscripted range for ordinary arrays; the word part must be
converted to an array, for example by using ${(AA)=name=...}
to activate field split- ting, when creating an associative
array.</p>

<p>a Sort in array index order; when combined with O sort
in reverse array index order. Note that a is therefore
equiva- lent to the default but Oa is useful for obtaining
an arrays elements in reverse order.</p>

<p>c With ${#name}, count the total number of characters in
an array, as if the elements were concatenated with spaces
between them.</p>

<p>C Capitalize the resulting words. Words in this case
refers to sequences of alphanumeric characters separated by
non-alphanu- merics, not to words that result from field
splitting.</p>

<p>e Perform parameter expansion, command substitution and
arithmetic expansion on the result. Such expansions can be
nested but too deep recursion may have unpredictable
effects.</p>

<p>f Split the result of the expansion to lines. This is a
shorthand for psn:.</p>

<p>F Join the words of arrays together using newline as a
separator. This is a shorthand for pjn:.</p>

<p>i Sort case-insensitively. May be combined with n or
O.</p>

<p>k If name refers to an associative array, substitute the
keys (element names) rather than the values of the elements.
Used with subscripts (including ordinary arrays), force
indices or keys to be substituted even if the subscript form
refers to val- ues. However, this flag may not be combined
with subscript ranges.</p>

<p>L Convert all letters in the result to lower case.</p>

<p>n Sort decimal integers numerically; if the first
differing char- acters of two test strings are not digits,
sorting is lexical. Integers with more initial zeroes are
sorted before those with fewer or none. Hence the array foo1
foo02 foo2 foo3 foo20 foo23 is sorted into the order shown.
May be combined with i or O.</p>

<p>o Sort the resulting words in ascending order; if this
appears on its own the sorting is lexical and case-sensitive
(unless the locale renders it case-insensitive). Sorting in
ascending order is the default for other forms of sorting,
so this is ignored if combined with a, i or n.</p>

<p>O Sort the resulting words in descending order; O
without a, i or n sorts in reverse lexical order. May be
combined with a, i or n to reverse the order of sorting.</p>

<p>P This forces the value of the parameter name to be
interpreted as a further parameter name, whose value will be
used where appro- priate. Note that flags set with one of
the typeset family of commands (in particular case
transformations) are not applied to the value of name used
in this fashion.</p>

<p>If used with a nested parameter or command substitution,
the result of that will be taken as a parameter name in the
same way. For example, if you have foo=bar and bar=baz, the
strings ${(P)foo}, ${(P)${foo}}, and ${(P)$(echo bar)} will
be expanded to baz.</p>

<p>q Quote the resulting words with backslashes;
unprintable or invalid characters are quoted using the
NNNform, with sepa- rate quotes for each octet. If this flag
is given twice, the resulting words are quoted in single
quotes and if it is given three times, the words are quoted
in double quotes; in these forms no special handling of
unprintable or invalid characters is attempted. If the flag
is given four times, the words are quoted in single quotes
preceded by a $.</p>

<p>Q Remove one level of quotes from the resulting
words.</p>

<p>t Use a string describing the type of the parameter
where the value of the parameter would usually appear. This
string con- sists of keywords separated by hyphens ( - ).
The first keyword in the string describes the main type, it
can be one of scalar, array, integer, float or association .
The other keywords describe the type in more detail:</p>

<p>local for local parameters</p>

<p>left for left justified parameters</p>

<p>right_blanks for right justified parameters with leading
blanks</p>

<p>right_zeros for right justified parameters with leading
zeros</p>

<p>lower for parameters whose value is converted to all
lower case when it is expanded</p>

<p>upper for parameters whose value is converted to all
upper case when it is expanded</p>

<p>readonly for readonly parameters</p>

<p>tag for tagged parameters</p>

<p>export for exported parameters</p>

<p>unique for arrays which keep only the first occurrence
of dupli- cated values</p>

<p>hide for parameters with the hide flag</p>

<p>special for special parameters defined by the shell</p>

<p>u Expand only the first occurrence of each unique
word.</p>

<p>U Convert all letters in the result to upper case.</p>

<p>v Used with k, substitute (as two consecutive words)
both the key and the value of each associative array
element. Used with sub- scripts, force values to be
substituted even if the subscript form refers to indices or
keys.</p>

<p>V Make any special characters in the resulting words
visible.</p>

<p>w With ${#name}, count words in arrays or strings; the s
flag may be used to set a word delimiter.</p>

<p>W Similar to w with the difference that empty words
between repeated delimiters are also counted.</p>

<p>X With this flag, parsing errors occurring with the Q, e
and # flags or the pattern matching forms such as
${name#pattern} are reported. Without the flag, errors are
silently ignored.</p>

<p>z Split the result of the expansion into words using
shell parsing to find the words, i.e. taking into account
any quoting in the value.</p>

<p>Note that this is done very late, as for the (s) flag.
So to access single words in the result, one has to use
nested expan- sions as in ${${(z)foo}[2]}. Likewise, to
remove the quotes in the resulting words one would do:
${(Q)${(z)foo}}.</p>

<p>0 Split the result of the expansion on null bytes. This
is a shorthand for ps0:.</p>

<p>The following flags (except p) are followed by one or
more arguments as shown. Any character, or the matching
pairs (...), {...}, [...], or &lt;...&gt; , may be used in
place of a colon as delimiters, but note that when a flag
takes more than one argument, a matched pair of delim- iters
must surround each argument.</p>

<p>p Recognize the same escape sequences as the print
builtin in string arguments to any of the flags described
below that follow this argument.</p>

<p>~ Force string arguments to any of the flags below that
follow within the parentheses to be treated as patterns.
Compare with a ~ outside parentheses, which forces the
entire substituted string to be treated as a pattern. Hence,
for example, [[ &quot;?&quot; = ${(~j.|.)array} ]] with the
EXTENDED_GLOB option set succeeds if and only if $array con-
tains the string ? as an element. The argument may be
repeated to toggle the behaviour; its effect only lasts to
the end of the parenthe- sised group.</p>

<p>j:string: Join the words of arrays together using string
as a separator. Note that this occurs before field splitting
by the s:string: flag or the SH_WORD_SPLIT option.</p>

<p>l:expr::string1::string2: Pad the resulting words on the
left. Each word will be trun- cated if required and placed
in a field expr characters wide.</p>

<p>The arguments :string1: and :string2: are optional;
neither, the first, or both may be given. Note that the same
pairs of delim- iters must be used for each of the three
arguments. The space to the left will be filled with string1
(concatenated as often as needed) or spaces if string1 is
not given. If both string1 and string2 are given, string2 is
inserted once directly to the left of each word, truncated
if necessary, before string1 is used to produce any
remaining padding.</p>

<p>If the MULTIBYTE option is in effect, the flag m may
also be given, in which case widths will be used for the
calculation of padding; otherwise individual multibyte
characters are treated as occupying one unit of width.</p>

<p>IF the MULTIBYTE option is not in effect, each byte in
the string is treated as occupying one unit of width.</p>

<p>Control characters are always assumed to be one unit
wide; this allows the mechanism to be used for generating
repetitions of control characters.</p>

<p>m Only useful together with one of the flags l or r or
with the # length operator when the MULTIBYTE option is in
effect. Use the character width reported by the system in
calculating the how much of the string it occupies or the
overall length of the string. Most printable characters have
a width of one unit, however certain Asian character sets
and certain special effects use wider characters; combining
characters have zero width.</p>

<p>r:expr::string1::string2: As l, but pad the words on the
right and insert string2 immedi- ately to the right of the
string to be padded.</p>

<p>Left and right padding may be used together. In this
case the strategy is to apply left padding to the first half
width of each of the resulting words, and right padding to
the second half. If the string to be padded has odd width
the extra padding is applied on the left.</p>

<p>s:string: Force field splitting at the separator string.
Note that a string of two or more characters means that all
of them must match in sequence; this differs from the
treatment of two or more characters in the IFS parameter.
See also the = flag and the SH_WORD_SPLIT option.</p>

<p>For historical reasons, the usual behaviour that empty
array elements are retained inside double quotes is disabled
for arrays generated by splitting; hence the following:</p>

<p>line=&quot;one::three&quot; print -l
&quot;${(s.:.)line}&quot;</p>

<p>produces two lines of output for one and three and
elides the empty field. To override this behaviour, supply
the &quot;(@)&quot; flag as well, i.e.
&quot;${(@s.:.)line}&quot;.</p>

<p>The following flags are meaningful with the ${...#...}
or ${...%...} forms. The S and I flags may also be used with
the ${.../...} forms.</p>

<p>S Search substrings as well as beginnings or ends; with
# start from the beginning and with % start from the end of
the string. With substitution via ${.../...} or ${...//...},
specifies non-greedy matching, i.e. that the shortest
instead of the longest match should be replaced.</p>

<p>I:expr: Search the exprth match (where expr evaluates to
a number). This only applies when searching for substrings,
either with the S flag, or with ${.../...} (only the exprth
match is substi- tuted) or ${...//...} (all matches from the
exprth on are sub- stituted). The default is to take the
first match.</p>

<p>The exprth match is counted such that there is either
one or zero matches from each starting position in the
string, although for global substitution matches overlapping
previous replace- ments are ignored. With the ${...%...} and
${...%%...} forms, the starting position for the match moves
backwards from the end as the index increases, while with
the other forms it moves for- ward from the start.</p>

<p>Hence with the string which switch is the right switch
for Ipswich? substitutions of the form ${(SI:N:)string#w*ch}
as N increases from 1 will match and remove which, witch,
witch and wich; the form using ## will match and remove
which switch is the right switch for Ipswich, witch is the
right switch for Ipswich, witch for Ipswich and wich. The
form using % will remove the same matches as for #, but in
reverse order, and the form using %% will remove the same
matches as for ## in reverse order.</p>

<p>B Include the index of the beginning of the match in the
result.</p>

<p>E Include the index of the end of the match in the
result.</p>

<p>M Include the matched portion in the result.</p>

<p>N Include the length of the match in the result.</p>

<p>R Include the unmatched portion in the result (the
Rest).</p>

<p>Rules Here is a summary of the rules for substitution;
this assumes that braces are present around the
substitution, i.e. ${...}. Some particu- lar examples are
given below. Note that the Zsh Development Group accepts no
responsibility for any brain damage which may occur during
the reading of the following rules.</p>

<p>1. Nested Substitution If multiple nested ${...} forms
are present, substitution is performed from the inside
outwards. At each level, the substi- tution takes account of
whether the current value is a scalar or an array, whether
the whole substitution is in double quotes, and what flags
are supplied to the current level of substitu- tion, just as
if the nested substitution were the outermost. The flags are
not propagated up to enclosing substitutions; the nested
substitution will return either a scalar or an array as
determined by the flags, possibly adjusted for quoting. All
the following steps take place where applicable at all
levels of substitution. Note that, unless the (P) flag is
present, the flags and any subscripts apply directly to the
value of the nested substitution; for example, the expansion
${${foo}} behaves exactly the same as ${foo}.</p>

<p>At each nested level of substitution, the substituted
words undergo all forms of single-word substitution (i.e.
not filename generation), including command substitution,
arithmetic expan- sion and filename expansion (i.e. leading
~ and =). Thus, for example, ${${:-=cat}:h} expands to the
directory where the cat program resides. (Explanation: the
internal substitution has no parameter but a default value
=cat, which is expanded by file- name expansion to a full
path; the outer substitution then applies the modifier :h
and takes the directory part of the path.)</p>

<p>2. Internal Parameter Flags Any parameter flags set by
one of the typeset family of com- mands, in particular the
L, R, Z, u and l flags for padding and capitalization, are
applied directly to the parameter value.</p>

<p>3. Parameter Subscripting If the value is a raw
parameter reference with a subscript, such as ${var[3]}, the
effect of subscripting is applied directly to the parameter.
Subscripts are evaluated left to right; subse- quent
subscripts apply to the scalar or array value yielded by the
previous subscript. Thus if var is an array, ${var[1][2]} is
the second character of the first word, but ${var[2,4][2]}
is the entire third word (the second word of the range of
words two through four of the original array). Any number of
subscripts may appear.</p>

<p>4. Parameter Name Replacement The effect of any (P)
flag, which treats the value so far as a parameter name and
replaces it with the corresponding value, is applied.</p>

<p>5. Double-Quoted Joining If the value after this process
is an array, and the substitu- tion appears in double
quotes, and no (@) flag is present at the current level, the
words of the value are joined with the first character of
the parameter $IFS, by default a space, between each word
(single word arrays are not modified). If the (j) flag is
present, that is used for joining instead of $IFS.</p>

<p>6. Nested Subscripting Any remaining subscripts (i.e. of
a nested substitution) are evaluated at this point, based on
whether the value is an array or a scalar. As with 2.,
multiple subscripts can appear. Note that ${foo[2,4][2]} is
thus equivalent to ${${foo[2,4]}[2]} and also to
&quot;${${(@)foo[2,4]}[2]}&quot; (the nested substitution
returns an array in both cases), but not to
&quot;${${foo[2,4]}[2]}&quot; (the nested substitution
returns a scalar because of the quotes).</p>

<p>7. Modifiers Any modifiers, as specified by a trailing
#, %, / (possi- bly doubled) or by a set of modifiers of the
form :... (see the section Modifiers in the section History
Expansion), are applied to the words of the value at this
level.</p>

<p>8. Forced Joining If the (j) flag is present, or no (j)
flag is present but the string is to be split as given by
rules 8. or 9., and joining did not take place at step 4.,
any words in the value are joined together using the given
string or the first charac- ter of $IFS if none. Note that
the (F) flag implicitly sup- plies a string for joining in
this manner.</p>

<p>9. Forced Splitting If one of the (s), (f) or (z) flags
are present, or the = specifier was present (e.g. ${=var}),
the word is split on occurrences of the specified string, or
(for = with neither of the two flags present) any of the
characters in $IFS.</p>

<p>10. Shell Word Splitting If no (s), (f) or = was given,
but the word is not quoted and the option SH_WORD_SPLIT is
set, the word is split on occur- rences of any of the
characters in $IFS. Note this step, too, takes place at all
levels of a nested substitution.</p>

<p>11. Uniqueness If the result is an array and the (u)
flag was present, dupli- cate elements are removed from the
array.</p>

<p>12. Ordering If the result is still an array and one of
the (o) or (O) flags was present, the array is
reordered.</p>

<p>13. Re-Evaluation Any (e) flag is applied to the value,
forcing it to be re-examined for new parameter
substitutions, but also for com- mand and arithmetic
substitutions.</p>

<p>14. Padding Any padding of the value by the (l.fill.) or
(r.fill.) flags is applied.</p>

<p>15. Semantic Joining In contexts where expansion
semantics requires a single word to result, all words are
rejoined with the first character of IFS between. So in
${(P)${(f)lines}} the value of ${lines} is split at
newlines, but then must be joined again before the P flag
can be applied.</p>

<p>If a single word is not required, this rule is
skipped.</p>

<p>Examples The flag f is useful to split a double-quoted
substitution line by line. For example,
${(f)&quot;$(&lt;file)&quot;} substitutes the contents of
file divided so that each line is an element of the
resulting array. Com- pare this with the effect of
$(&lt;file) alone, which divides the file up by words, or
the same inside double quotes, which makes the entire con-
tent of the file a single string.</p>

<p>The following illustrates the rules for nested parameter
expansions. Suppose that $foo contains the array (bar
baz):</p>

<p>&quot;${(@)${foo}[1]}&quot; This produces the result b.
First, the inner substitution &quot;${foo}&quot;, which has
no array (@) flag, produces a single word result &quot;bar
baz&quot;. The outer substitution &quot;${(@)...[1]}&quot;
detects that this is a scalar, so that (despite the (@)
flag) the sub- script picks the first character.</p>

<p>&quot;${${(@)foo}[1]}&quot; This produces the result
bar. In this case, the inner substi- tution
&quot;${(@)foo}&quot; produces the array (bar baz). The
outer substitution &quot;${...[1]}&quot; detects that this
is an array and picks the first word. This is similar to the
simple case &quot;${foo[1]}&quot;.</p>

<p>As an example of the rules for word splitting and
joining, suppose $foo contains the array (ax1 bx1). Then</p>

<p>${(s/x/)foo} produces the words a, 1 b and 1.</p>

<p>${(j/x/s/x/)foo} produces a, 1, b and 1.</p>

<p>${(s/x/)foo%%1*} produces a and b (note the extra
space). As substitution occurs before either joining or
splitting, the operation first generates the modified array
(ax bx), which is joined to give &quot;ax bx&quot;, and then
split to give a, b and . The final empty string will then be
elided, as it is not in double quotes.</p>

<p>COMMAND SUBSTITUTION A command enclosed in parentheses
preceded by a dollar sign, like $(...), or quoted with grave
accents, like.., is replaced with its standard output, with
any trailing newlines deleted. If the sub- stitution is not
enclosed in double quotes, the output is broken into words
using the IFS parameter. The substitution $(cat foo) may be
replaced by the equivalent but faster $(&lt;foo). In either
case, if the option GLOB_SUBST is set, the output is
eligible for filename gen- eration.</p>

<p>ARITHMETIC EXPANSION A string of the form $[exp] or
$((exp)) is substituted with the value of the arithmetic
expression exp. exp is subjected to parameter expansion,
command substitution and arithmetic expansion before it is
evaluated. See the section Arithmetic Evaluation.</p>

<p>BRACE EXPANSION A string of the form foo{xx,yy,zz}bar is
expanded to the individual words fooxxbar, fooyybar and
foozzbar. Left-to-right order is preserved. This construct
may be nested. Commas may be quoted in order to include them
literally in a word.</p>

<p>An expression of the form {n1..n2}, where n1 and n2 are
integers, is expanded to every number between n1 and n2
inclusive. If either number begins with a zero, all the
resulting numbers will be padded with lead- ing zeroes to
that minimum width. If the numbers are in decreasing order
the resulting sequence will also be in decreasing order.</p>

<p>If a brace expression matches none of the above forms,
it is left unchanged, unless the option BRACE_CCL (an
abbreviation for brace character class) is set. In that
case, it is expanded to a list of the individual characters
between the braces sorted into the order of the characters
in the ASCII character set (multibyte characters are not
currently handled). The syntax is similar to a [...]
expression in filename generation: - is treated specially to
denote a range of characters, but ^ or ! as the first
character is treated normally. For example, {abcdef0-9}
expands to 16 words 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 a b c d e f.</p>

<p>Note that brace expansion is not part of filename
generation (glob- bing); an expression such as */{foo,bar}
is split into two separate words */foo and */bar before
filename generation takes place. In par- ticular, note that
this is liable to produce a no match error if either of the
two expressions does not match; this is to be contrasted
with */(foo|bar), which is treated as a single pattern but
otherwise has similar effects.</p>

<p>To combine brace expansion with array expansion, see the
${^spec} form described in the section Parameter Expansion
above.</p>

<p>FILENAME EXPANSION Each word is checked to see if it
begins with an unquoted ~. If it does, then the word up to a
/, or the end of the word if there is no /, is checked to
see if it can be substituted in one of the ways described
here. If so, then the ~ and the checked portion are replaced
with the appropriate substitute value.</p>

<p>A ~ by itself is replaced by the value of $HOME. A ~
followed by a + or a - is replaced by the value of $PWD or
$OLDPWD, respectively.</p>

<p>A ~ followed by a number is replaced by the directory at
that posi- tion in the directory stack. ~0 is equivalent to
~+, and ~1 is the top of the stack. ~+ followed by a number
is replaced by the directory at that position in the
directory stack. ~+0 is equivalent to ~+, and ~+1 is the top
of the stack. ~- followed by a number is replaced by the
directory that many positions from the bottom of the stack.
~-0 is the bottom of the stack. The PUSHD_MINUS option
exchanges the effects of ~+ and ~- where they are followed
by a number.</p>

<p>Dynamic named directories The feature described here is
only available if the shell function zsh_directory_name
exists.</p>

<p>A ~ followed by a string namstr in unquoted square
brackets is treated specially as a dynamic directory name.
Note that the first unquoted closing square bracket always
terminates namstr. The shell function is passed two
arguments: the string n (for name) and namstr. It should
either set the array reply to a single element which is the
directory corresponding to the name and return status zero
(executing an assignment as the last statement is usually
sufficient), or it should return status non-zero. In the
former case the element of reply is used as the directory;
in the latter case the substitution is deemed to have failed
and NOMATCH handling is applied if the option is set.</p>

<p>The function zsh_directory_name is also used to see if a
directory can be turned into a name, for example when
printing the directory stack or when expanding %~ in
prompts. In this case the function is passed two arguments:
the string d (for directory) and the candidate for dynamic
naming. The function should either return non-zero status,
if the directory cannot be named by the function, or it
should set the array reply to consist of two elements: the
first is the dynamic name for the directory (as would appear
within ~[...]), and the second is the pre- fix length of the
directory to be replaced. For example, if the trial
directory is /home/myname/src/zsh and the dynamic name for
/home/myname/src (which has 16 characters) is s, then the
function sets</p>

<p>reply=(s 16)</p>

<p>The directory name so returned is compared with possible
static names for parts of the directory path, as described
below; it is used if the prefix length matched (16 in the
example) is longer than that matched by any static name.</p>

<p>As a working example, here is a function that expands
any dynamic names beginning with the string p: to
directories below /home/pws/perforce. In this simple case a
static name for the directory would be just as
effective.</p>

<p>zsh_directory_name() { emulate -L zsh setopt
extendedglob local -a match mbegin mend if [[ $1 = d ]];
then if [[ $2 = (#b)(/home/pws/perforce/)([^/]##)* ]]; then
typeset -ga reply reply=(p:$match[2] $(( ${#match[1]} +
${#match[2]} )) ) else return 1 fi else [[ $2 != (#b)p:(?*)
]] &amp;&amp; return 1 typeset -ga reply
reply=(/home/pws/perforce/$match[1]) fi return 0 }</p>

<p>Static named directories A ~ followed by anything not
already covered consisting of any number of alphanumeric
characters or underscore (_), hyphen (- ), or dot (.) is
looked up as a named directory, and replaced by the value of
that named directory if found. Named directories are
typically home directories for users on the system. They may
also be defined if the text after the ~ is the name of a
string shell parameter whose value begins with a /. Note
that trailing slashes will be removed from the path to the
directory (though the original parameter is not
modified).</p>

<p>It is also possible to define directory names using the
-d option to the hash builtin.</p>

<p>In certain circumstances (in prompts, for instance),
when the shell prints a path, the path is checked to see if
it has a named directory as its prefix. If so, then the
prefix portion is replaced with a ~ followed by the name of
the directory. The shortest way of referring to the
directory is used, with ties broken in favour of using a
named directory, except when the directory is / itself. The
parameters $PWD and $OLDPWD are never abbreviated in this
fashion.</p>

<p>=expansion If a word begins with an unquoted = and the
EQUALS option is set, the remainder of the word is taken as
the name of a command. If a command exists by that name, the
word is replaced by the full pathname of the command.</p>

<p>Notes Filename expansion is performed on the right hand
side of a parameter assignment, including those appearing
after commands of the typeset family. In this case, the
right hand side will be treated as a colon-separated list in
the manner of the PATH parameter, so that a ~ or an =
following a : is eligible for expansion. All such behaviour
can be disabled by quoting the ~, the =, or the whole
expression (but not simply the colon); the EQUALS option is
also respected.</p>

<p>If the option MAGIC_EQUAL_SUBST is set, any unquoted
shell argument in the form identifier=expression becomes
eligible for file expansion as described in the previous
paragraph. Quoting the first = also inhibits this.</p>

<p>FILENAME GENERATION If a word contains an unquoted
instance of one of the characters *, ( , | , &lt;, [, or ?,
it is regarded as a pattern for filename generation, unless
the GLOB option is unset. If the EXTENDED_GLOB option is
set, the ^ and # characters also denote a pattern; other-
wise they are not treated specially by the shell.</p>

<p>The word is replaced with a list of sorted filenames
that match the pattern. If no matching pattern is found, the
shell gives an error message, unless the NULL_GLOB option is
set, in which case the word is deleted; or unless the
NOMATCH option is unset, in which case the word is left
unchanged.</p>

<p>In filename generation, the character / must be matched
explicitly; also, a . must be matched explicitly at the
beginning of a pattern or after a / , unless the GLOB_DOTS
option is set. No filename genera- tion pattern matches the
files . or ... In other instances of pat- tern matching, the
/ and . are not treated specially.</p>

<p>Glob Operators * Matches any string, including the null
string.</p>

<p>? Matches any character.</p>

<p>[...] Matches any of the enclosed characters. Ranges of
characters can be specified by separating two characters by
a -. A - or ] may be matched by including it as the first
character in the list. There are also several named classes
of characters, in the form [:name:] with the following
meanings. The first set use the macros provided by the
operating system to test for the given character
combinations, including any modifications due to local
language settings, see ctype(3):</p>

<p>[:alnum:] The character is alphanumeric</p>

<p>[:alpha:] The character is alphabetic</p>

<p>[:ascii:] The character is 7-bit, i.e. is a single-byte
character without the top bit set.</p>

<p>[:blank:] The character is either space or tab</p>

<p>[:cntrl:] The character is a control character</p>

<p>[:digit:] The character is a decimal digit</p>

<p>[:graph:] The character is a printable character other
than whites- pace</p>

<p>[:lower:] The character is a lowercase letter</p>

<p>[:print:] The character is printable</p>

<p>[:punct:] The character is printable but neither
alphanumeric nor whitespace</p>

<p>[:space:] The character is whitespace</p>

<p>[:upper:] The character is an uppercase letter</p>

<p>[:xdigit:] The character is a hexadecimal digit</p>

<p>Another set of named classes is handled internally by
the shell and is not sensitive to the locale:</p>

<p>[:IDENT:] The character is allowed to form part of a
shell identi- fier, such as a parameter name</p>

<p>[:IFS:] The character is used as an input field
separator, i.e. is contained in the IFS parameter</p>

<p>[:IFSSPACE:] The character is an IFS white space
character; see the documentation for IFS in the zshparam(1)
manual page.</p>

<p>[:WORD:] The character is treated as part of a word;
this test is sensitive to the value of the WORDCHARS
parameter</p>

<p>Note that the square brackets are additional to those
enclosing the whole set of characters, so to test for a
single alphanu- meric character you need [[:alnum:]]. Named
character sets can be used alongside other types, e.g.
[[:alpha:]0-9].</p>

<p>[^...] [!...] Like [...], except that it matches any
character which is not in the given set.</p>

<p>&lt;[x]-[y]&gt; Matches any number in the range x to y,
inclusive. Either of the numbers may be omitted to make the
range open-ended; hence &lt;-&gt; matches any number. To
match individual digits, the [...] form is more
efficient.</p>

<p>Be careful when using other wildcards adjacent to
patterns of this form; for example, &lt;0-9&gt;* will
actually match any number whatsoever at the start of the
string, since the &lt;0-9&gt; will match the first digit,
and the * will match any others. This is a trap for the
unwary, but is in fact an inevitable conse- quence of the
rule that the longest possible match always suc- ceeds.
Expressions such as &lt;0-9&gt;[^[:digit:]]* can be used
instead.</p>

<p>(...) Matches the enclosed pattern. This is used for
grouping. If the KSH_GLOB option is set, then a @, *, +, ?
or ! immediately preceding the ( is treated specially, as
detailed below. The option SH_GLOB prevents bare parentheses
from being used in this way, though the KSH_GLOB option is
still available.</p>

<p>Note that grouping cannot extend over multiple
directories: it is an error to have a / within a group (this
only applies for patterns used in filename generation).
There is one exception: a group of the form (pat/)#
appearing as a complete path segment can match a sequence of
directories. For example, foo/(a*/)#bar matches foo/bar,
foo/any/bar, foo/any/anyother/bar, and so on.</p>

<p>x|y Matches either x or y. This operator has lower
precedence than any other. The | character must be within
parentheses, to avoid interpretation as a pipeline.</p>

<p>^x (Requires EXTENDED_GLOB to be set.) Matches anything
except the pattern x. This has a higher precedence than /,
so ^foo/bar will search directories in . except ./foo for a
file named bar.</p>

<p>x~y (Requires EXTENDED_GLOB to be set.) Match anything
that matches the pattern x but does not match y. This has
lower precedence than any operator except |, so */*~foo/bar
will search for all files in all directories in . and then
exclude foo/bar if there was such a match. Multiple patterns
can be excluded by foo~bar~baz . In the exclusion pattern
(y), / and . are not treated specially the way they usually
are in globbing.</p>

<p>x# (Requires EXTENDED_GLOB to be set.) Matches zero or
more occur- rences of the pattern x. This operator has high
precedence; 12# is equivalent to 1(2#), rather than (12)#.
It is an error for an unquoted # to follow something which
cannot be repeated; this includes an empty string, a pattern
already fol- lowed by ##, or parentheses when part of a
KSH_GLOB pattern (for example, !(foo)# is invalid and must
be replaced by *(!(foo))).</p>

<p>x## (Requires EXTENDED_GLOB to be set.) Matches one or
more occur- rences of the pattern x. This operator has high
precedence; 12## is equivalent to 1(2##), rather than (12)##
. No more than two active # characters may appear together.
(Note the potential clash with glob qualifiers in the form
1(2##) which should therefore be avoided.)</p>

<p>ksh-like Glob Operators If the KSH_GLOB option is set,
the effects of parentheses can be modi- fied by a preceding
@, *, +, ? or !. This character need not be unquoted to have
special effects, but the ( must be.</p>

<p>@(...) Match the pattern in the parentheses. (Like (...)
.)</p>

<p>*(...) Match any number of occurrences. (Like
(...)#.)</p>

<p>+(...) Match at least one occurrence. (Like
(...)##.)</p>

<p>?(...) Match zero or one occurrence. (Like (|...).)</p>

<p>!(...) Match anything but the expression in parentheses.
(Like (^(...)).)</p>

<p>Precedence The precedence of the operators given above
is (highest) ^ , /, ~, | (lowest); the remaining operators
are simply treated from left to right as part of a string,
with # and ## applying to the shortest possible preceding
unit (i.e. a character, ?, [...], &lt;...&gt; , or a
parenthesised expression). As mentioned above, a / used as a
direc- tory separator may not appear inside parentheses,
while a | must do so; in patterns used in other contexts
than filename generation (for example, in case statements
and tests within [[...]]), a / is not special; and / is also
not special after a ~ appearing outside parentheses in a
filename pattern.</p>

<p>Globbing Flags There are various flags which affect any
text to their right up to the end of the enclosing group or
to the end of the pattern; they require the EXTENDED_GLOB
option. All take the form (#X) where X may have one of the
following forms:</p>

<p>i Case insensitive: upper or lower case characters in
the pattern match upper or lower case characters.</p>

<p>l Lower case characters in the pattern match upper or
lower case characters; upper case characters in the pattern
still only match upper case characters.</p>

<p>I Case sensitive: locally negates the effect of i or l
from that point on.</p>

<p>b Activate backreferences for parenthesised groups in
the pattern; this does not work in filename generation. When
a pattern with a set of active parentheses is matched, the
strings matched by the groups are stored in the array
$match, the indices of the beginning of the matched
parentheses in the array $mbegin, and the indices of the end
in the array $mend, with the first ele- ment of each array
corresponding to the first parenthesised group, and so on.
These arrays are not otherwise special to the shell. The
indices use the same convention as does parameter
substitution, so that elements of $mend and $mbegin may be
used in subscripts; the KSH_ARRAYS option is respected. Sets
of globbing flags are not considered parenthesised groups;
only the first nine active parentheses can be
referenced.</p>

<p>For example,</p>

<p>foo=&quot;a string with a message&quot; if [[ $foo =
(a|an(#b)(** ]]; then print ${foo[$mbegin[1],$mend[1]]}
fi</p>

<p>prints string with a. Note that the first parenthesis is
before the (#b) and does not create a backreference.</p>

<p>Backreferences work with all forms of pattern matching
other than filename generation, but note that when
performing matches on an entire array, such as
${array#pattern}, or a global sub- stitution, such as
${param//pat/repl}, only the data for the last match remains
available. In the case of global replace- ments this may
still be useful. See the example for the m flag below.</p>

<p>The numbering of backreferences strictly follows the
order of the opening parentheses from left to right in the
pattern string, although sets of parentheses may be nested.
There are special rules for parentheses followed by # or ##
. Only the last match of the parenthesis is remembered: for
example, in [[ abab = (#b)([ab])# ]], only the final b is
stored in match[1]. Thus extra parentheses may be necessary
to match the complete segment: for example, use X((ab|cd)#)Y
to match a whole string of either ab or cd between X and Y,
using the value of $match[1] rather than $match[2].</p>

<p>If the match fails none of the parameters is altered, so
in some cases it may be necessary to initialise them
beforehand. If some of the backreferences fail to match --
which happens if they are in an alternate branch which fails
to match, or if they are followed by # and matched zero
times -- then the matched string is set to the empty string,
and the start and end indices are set to -1.</p>

<p>Pattern matching with backreferences is slightly slower
than without.</p>

<p>B Deactivate backreferences, negating the effect of the
b flag from that point on.</p>

<p>cN,M The flag (#cN,M) can be used anywhere that the # or
## operators can be used; it cannot be combined with other
globbing flags and a bad pattern error occurs if it is
misplaced. It is equivalent to the form {N,M} in regular
expressions. The previous charac- ter or group is required
to match between N and M times, inclu- sive. The form (#cN)
requires exactly N matches; (#c,M) is equivalent to
specifying N as 0; (#cN,) specifies that there is no maximum
limit on the number of matches.</p>

<p>m Set references to the match data for the entire string
matched; this is similar to backreferencing and does not
work in filename generation. The flag must be in effect at
the end of the pat- tern, i.e. not local to a group. The
parameters $MATCH, $MBEGIN and $MEND will be set to the
string matched and to the indices of the beginning and end
of the string, respectively. This is most useful in
parameter substitutions, as otherwise the string matched is
obvious.</p>

<p>For example,</p>

<p>arr=(veldt jynx grimps waqf zho buck) print
${arr//(#m)[aeiou]/${(U)MATCH}}</p>

<p>forces all the matches (i.e. all vowels) into uppercase,
print- ing vEldt jynx grImps wAqf zhO bUck.</p>

<p>Unlike backreferences, there is no speed penalty for
using match references, other than the extra substitutions
required for the replacement strings in cases such as the
example shown.</p>

<p>M Deactivate the m flag, hence no references to match
data will be created.</p>

<p>anum Approximate matching: num errors are allowed in the
string matched by the pattern. The rules for this are
described in the next subsection.</p>

<p>s, e Unlike the other flags, these have only a local
effect, and each must appear on its own: (#s) and (#e) are
the only valid forms. The (#s) flag succeeds only at the
start of the test string, and the (#e) flag succeeds only at
the end of the test string; they correspond to ^ and $ in
standard regular expressions. They are useful for matching
path segments in pat- terns other than those in filename
generation (where path seg- ments are in any case treated
separately). For example, *((#s)|/)test((#e)|/)* matches a
path segment test in any of the following strings: test,
test/at/start, at/end/test, in/test/middle.</p>

<p>Another use is in parameter substitution; for example
${array/(#s)A*Z(#e)} will remove only elements of an array
which match the complete pattern A*Z. There are other ways
of performing many operations of this type, however the
combination of the substitution operations / and // with the
(#s) and (#e) flags provides a single simple and memorable
method.</p>

<p>Note that assertions of the form (^(#s)) also work, i.e.
match anywhere except at the start of the string, although
this actu- ally means anything except a zero-length portion
at the start of the string; you need to use
(&quot;&quot;~(#s)) to match a zero-length portion of the
string not at the start.</p>

<p>q A q and everything up to the closing parenthesis of
the glob- bing flags are ignored by the pattern matching
code. This is intended to support the use of glob
qualifiers, see below. The result is that the pattern
(#b)(*).c(#q.) can be used both for globbing and for
matching against a string. In the former case, the (#q.)
will be treated as a glob qualifier and the (#b) will not be
useful, while in the latter case the (#b) is use- ful for
backreferences and the (#q.) will be ignored. Note that
colon modifiers in the glob qualifiers are also not applied
in ordinary pattern matching.</p>

<p>u Respect the current locale in determining the presence
of multi- byte characters in a pattern, provided the shell
was compiled with MULTIBYTE_SUPPORT. This overrides the
MULTIBYTE option; the default behaviour is taken from the
option. Compare U. (Mnemonic: typically multibyte characters
are from Unicode in the UTF-8 encoding, although any
extension of ASCII supported by the system library may be
used.)</p>

<p>U All characters are considered to be a single byte
long. The opposite of u. This overrides the MULTIBYTE
option.</p>

<p>For example, the test string fooxx can be matched by the
pattern (#i)FOOXX, but not by (#l)FOOXX, (#i)FOO(#I)XX or
((#i)FOOX)X. The string (#ia2)readme specifies
case-insensitive matching of readme with up to two
errors.</p>

<p>When using the ksh syntax for grouping both KSH_GLOB and
EXTENDED_GLOB must be set and the left parenthesis should be
preceded by @. Note also that the flags do not affect
letters inside [...] groups, in other words (#i)[a-z] still
matches only lowercase letters. Finally, note that when
examining whole paths case-insensitively every directory
must be searched for all files which match, so that a
pattern of the form (#i)/foo/bar/... is potentially
slow.</p>

<p>Approximate Matching When matching approximately, the
shell keeps a count of the errors found, which cannot exceed
the number specified in the (#anum) flags. Four types of
error are recognised:</p>

<p>1. Different characters, as in fooxbar and fooybar.</p>

<p>2. Transposition of characters, as in banana and
abnana.</p>

<p>3. A character missing in the target string, as with the
pattern road and target string rod.</p>

<p>4. An extra character appearing in the target string, as
with stove and strove.</p>

<p>Thus, the pattern (#a3)abcd matches dcba, with the
errors occurring by using the first rule twice and the
second once, grouping the string as [d][cb][a] and
[a][bc][d].</p>

<p>Non-literal parts of the pattern must match exactly,
including charac- ters in character ranges: hence (#a1)???
matches strings of length four, by applying rule 4 to an
empty part of the pattern, but not strings of length two,
since all the ? must match. Other characters which must
match exactly are initial dots in filenames (unless the
GLOB_DOTS option is set), and all slashes in filenames, so
that a/bc is two errors from ab/c (the slash cannot be
transposed with another char- acter). Similarly, errors are
counted separately for non-contiguous strings in the
pattern, so that (ab|cd)ef is two errors from aebf.</p>

<p>When using exclusion via the ~ operator, approximate
matching is treated entirely separately for the excluded
part and must be activated separately. Thus,
(#a1)README~READ_ME matches READ.ME but not READ_ME, as the
trailing READ_ME is matched without approximation. However,
(#a1)README~(#a1)READ_ME does not match any pattern of the
form READ?ME as all such forms are now excluded.</p>

<p>Apart from exclusions, there is only one overall error
count; however, the maximum errors allowed may be altered
locally, and this can be delimited by grouping. For example,
(#a1)cat((#a0)dog)fox allows one error in total, which may
not occur in the dog section, and the pattern
(#a1)cat(#a0)dog(#a1)fox is equivalent. Note that the point
at which an error is first found is the crucial one for
establishing whether to use approximation; for example,
(#a1)abc(#a0)xyz will not match abcdxyz, because the error
occurs at the x , where approximation is turned off.</p>

<p>Entire path segments may be matched approximately, so
that (#a1)/foo/d/is/available/at/the/bar allows one error in
any path seg- ment. This is much less efficient than without
the (#a1), however, since every directory in the path must
be scanned for a possible approximate match. It is best to
place the (#a1) after any path seg- ments which are known to
be correct.</p>

<p>Recursive Globbing A pathname component of the form
(foo/)# matches a path consisting of zero or more
directories matching the pattern foo.</p>

<p>As a shorthand, **/ is equivalent to (*/)#; note that
this there- fore matches files in the current directory as
well as subdirectories. Thus:</p>

<p>ls (*/)#bar</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>ls **/bar</p>

<p>does a recursive directory search for files named bar
(potentially including the file bar in the current
directory). This form does not follow symbolic links; the
alternative form ***/ does, but is other- wise identical.
Neither of these can be combined with other forms of
globbing within the same path segment; in that case, the *
operators revert to their usual effect.</p>

<p>Glob Qualifiers Patterns used for filename generation
may end in a list of qualifiers enclosed in parentheses. The
qualifiers specify which filenames that otherwise match the
given pattern will be inserted in the argument list.</p>

<p>If the option BARE_GLOB_QUAL is set, then a trailing set
of parentheses containing no | or ( characters (or ~ if it
is special) is taken as a set of glob qualifiers. A glob
subexpression that would normally be taken as glob
qualifiers, for example (^x), can be forced to be treated as
part of the glob pattern by doubling the parentheses, in
this case producing ((^x)).</p>

<p>If the option EXTENDED_GLOB is set, a different syntax
for glob quali- fiers is available, namely (#qx) where x is
any of the same glob qualifiers used in the other format.
The qualifiers must still appear at the end of the pattern.
However, with this syntax multiple glob qualifiers may be
chained together. They are treated as a logical AND of the
individual sets of flags. Also, as the syntax is
unambiguous, the expression will be treated as glob
qualifiers just as long any parentheses contained within it
are balanced; appearance of |, ( or ~ does not negate the
effect. Note that qualifiers will be recog- nised in this
form even if a bare glob qualifier exists at the end of the
pattern, for example *(#q*)(.) will recognise executable
regular files if both options are set; however, mixed syntax
should probably be avoided for the sake of clarity.</p>

<p>A qualifier may be any one of the following:</p>

<p>/ directories</p>

<p>F full (i.e. non-empty) directories. Note that the
opposite sense (^F) expands to empty directories and all
non-directories. Use (/^F) for empty directories</p>

<p>. plain files</p>

<p>@ symbolic links</p>

<p>= sockets</p>

<p>p named pipes (FIFOs)</p>

<p>* executable plain files (0100)</p>

<p>% device files (character or block special)</p>

<p>%b block special files</p>

<p>%c character special files</p>

<p>r owner-readable files (0400)</p>

<p>w owner-writable files (0200)</p>

<p>x owner-executable files (0100)</p>

<p>A group-readable files (0040)</p>

<p>I group-writable files (0020)</p>

<p>E group-executable files (0010)</p>

<p>R world-readable files (0004)</p>

<p>W world-writable files (0002)</p>

<p>X world-executable files (0001)</p>

<p>s setuid files (04000)</p>

<p>S setgid files (02000)</p>

<p>t files with the sticky bit (01000)</p>

<p>fspec files with access rights matching spec. This spec
may be a octal number optionally preceded by a =, a +, or a
-. If none of these characters is given, the behavior is the
same as for =. The octal number describes the mode bits to
be expected, if com- bined with a =, the value given must
match the file-modes exactly, with a +, at least the bits in
the given number must be set in the file-modes, and with a
-, the bits in the number must not be set. Giving a ?
instead of a octal digit anywhere in the number ensures that
the corresponding bits in the file-modes are not checked,
this is only useful in combination with =.</p>

<p>If the qualifier f is followed by any other character
anything up to the next matching character ([, {, and &lt;
match ], }, and &gt; respectively, any other character
matches itself) is taken as a list of comma-separated
sub-specs. Each sub-spec may be either an octal number as
described above or a list of any of the characters u, g, o,
and a, followed by a =, a +, or a -, followed by a list of
any of the characters r , w, x, s, and t, or an octal digit.
The first list of characters specify which access rights are
to be checked. If a u is given, those for the owner of the
file are used, if a g is given, those of the group are
checked, a o means to test those of other users, and the a
says to test all three groups. The =, +, and - again says
how the modes are to be checked and have the same meaning as
described for the first form above. The second list of
characters finally says which access rights are to be
expected: r for read access, w for write access, x for the
right to execute the file (or to search a directory), s for
the setuid and setgid bits, and t for the sticky bit.</p>

<p>Thus, *(f70?) gives the files for which the owner has
read, write, and execute permission, and for which other
group members have no rights, independent of the permissions
for other users. The pattern *(f-100) gives all files for
which the owner does not have execute permission, and
*(f:gu+w,o-rx:) gives the files for which the owner and the
other members of the group have at least write permission,
and for which other users dont have read or execute
permission.</p>

<p>estring +cmd The string will be executed as shell code.
The filename will be included in the list if and only if the
code returns a zero sta- tus (usually the status of the last
command). The first charac- ter after the e will be used as
a separator and anything up to the next matching separator
will be taken as the string; [, {, and &lt; match ], }, and
&gt;, respectively, while any other character matches
itself. Note that expansions must be quoted in the string to
prevent them from being expanded before globbing is
done.</p>

<p>During the execution of string the filename currently
being tested is available in the parameter REPLY; the
parameter may be altered to a string to be inserted into the
list instead of the original filename. In addition, the
parameter reply may be set to an array or a string, which
overrides the value of REPLY. If set to an array, the latter
is inserted into the command line word by word.</p>

<p>For example, suppose a directory contains a single file
lonely . Then the expression *(e: reply=(${REPLY}{1,2}:)
will cause the words lonely1 lonely2 to be inserted into the
command line. Note the quotation marks.</p>

<p>The form +cmd has the same effect, but no delimiters
appear around cmd. Instead, cmd is taken as the longest
sequence of characters following the + that are alphanumeric
or underscore. Typically cmd will be the name of a shell
function that contains the appropriate test. For
example,</p>

<p>nt() { [[ $REPLY -nt $NTREF ]] } NTREF=reffile ls -l
*(+nt)</p>

<p>lists all files in the directory that have been modified
more recently than reffile.</p>

<p>ddev files on the device dev</p>

<p>l[-|+]ct files having a link count less than ct (-),
greater than ct (+), or equal to ct</p>

<p>U files owned by the effective user ID</p>

<p>G files owned by the effective group ID</p>

<p>uid files owned by user ID id if that is a number.
Otherwise, id specifies a user name: the character after the
u will be taken as a separator and the string between it and
the next matching separator will be taken as a user name.
The starting separators [, {, and &lt; match the final
separators ], }, and &gt; , respectively; any other
character matches itself. The selected files are those owned
by this user. For example, u:foo: or u[foo] selects files
owned by user foo.</p>

<p>gid like uid but with group IDs or names</p>

<p>a[Mwhms][-|+]n files accessed exactly n days ago. Files
accessed within the last n days are selected using a
negative value for n (-n). Files accessed more than n days
ago are selected by a positive n value (+n). Optional unit
specifiers M, w, h, m or s (e.g. ah5 ) cause the check to be
performed with months (of 30 days), weeks, hours, minutes or
seconds instead of days, respec- tively.</p>

<p>Any fractional part of the difference between the access
time and the current part in the appropriate units is
ignored in the comparison. For instance, echo *(ah-5) would
echo files accessed within the last five hours, while echo
*(ah+5) would echo files accessed at least six hours ago, as
times strictly between five and six hours are treated as
five hours.</p>

<p>m[Mwhms][-|+]n like the file access qualifier, except
that it uses the file modification time.</p>

<p>c[Mwhms][-|+]n like the file access qualifier, except
that it uses the file inode change time.</p>

<p>L[+|-]n files less than n bytes (-), more than n bytes
(+), or exactly n bytes in length. If this flag is directly
followed by a k ( K ), m (M), or p (P) (e.g. Lk-50) the
check is per- formed with kilobytes, megabytes, or blocks
(of 512 bytes) instead.</p>

<p>^ negates all qualifiers following it</p>

<p>- toggles between making the qualifiers work on symbolic
links (the default) and the files they point to</p>

<p>M sets the MARK_DIRS option for the current pattern</p>

<p>T appends a trailing qualifier mark to the filenames,
analogous to the LIST_TYPES option, for the current pattern
(overrides M)</p>

<p>N sets the NULL_GLOB option for the current pattern</p>

<p>D sets the GLOB_DOTS option for the current pattern</p>

<p>n sets the NUMERIC_GLOB_SORT option for the current
pattern</p>

<p>oc specifies how the names of the files should be
sorted. If c is n they are sorted by name (the default); if
it is L they are sorted depending on the size (length) of
the files; if l they are sorted by the number of links; if
a, m, or c they are sorted by the time of the last access,
modification, or inode change respectively; if d, files in
subdirectories appear before those in the current directory
at each level of the search -- this is best combined with
other criteria, for example odon to sort on names for files
within the same directory; if N, no sorting is performed.
Note that a, m, and c compare the age against the current
time, hence the first name in the list is the youngest file.
Also note that the modifiers ^ and - are used, so *(^-oL)
gives a list of all files sorted by file size in descending
order, following any symbolic links. Unless oN is used,
multiple order specifiers may occur to resolve ties.</p>

<p>oe and o+ are special cases; they are each followed by
shell code, delimited as for the e glob qualifier and the +
glob qual- ifier respectively (see above). The code is
executed for each matched file with the parameter REPLY set
to the name of the file on entry. The code should modify the
parameter REPLY in some fashion. On return, the value of the
parameter is used instead of the file name as the string on
which to sort. Unlike other sort operators, oe and o+ may be
repeated, but note that the maximum number of sort operators
of any kind that may appear in any glob expression is
12.</p>

<p>Oc like o, but sorts in descending order; i.e. *(^oc) is
the same as *(Oc) and *(^Oc) is the same as *(oc); Od puts
files in the current directory before those in
subdirectories at each level of the search.</p>

<p>[beg[,end]] specifies which of the matched filenames
should be included in the returned list. The syntax is the
same as for array sub- scripts. beg and the optional end may
be mathematical expres- sions. As in parameter subscripting
they may be negative to make them count from the last match
backward. E.g.: *(-OL[1,3]) gives a list of the names of the
three largest files.</p>

<p>More than one of these lists can be combined, separated
by commas. The whole list matches if at least one of the
sublists matches (they are ored, the qualifiers in the
sublists are and ed). Some qualifiers, however, affect all
matches generated, independent of the sublist in which they
are given. These are the qualifiers M, T, N , D, n, o, O and
the subscripts given in brackets ([...]).</p>

<p>If a : appears in a qualifier list, the remainder of the
expression in parenthesis is interpreted as a modifier (see
the section Modi- fiers in the section History Expansion ).
Each modifier must be introduced by a separate :. Note also
that the result after modifi- cation does not have to be an
existing file. The name of any existing file can be followed
by a modifier of the form (:..) even if no actual filename
generation is performed, although note that the pres- ence
of the parentheses causes the entire expression to be
subjected to any global pattern matching options such as
NULL_GLOB. Thus:</p>

<p>ls *(-/)</p>

<p>lists all directories and symbolic links that point to
directories, and</p>

<p>ls *(%W)</p>

<p>lists all world-writable device files in the current
directory, and</p>

<p>ls *(W,X)</p>

<p>lists all files in the current directory that are
world-writable or world-executable, and</p>

<p>echo /tmp/foo*(u0^@:t)</p>

<p>outputs the basename of all root-owned files beginning
with the string foo in /tmp, ignoring symlinks, and</p>

<p>ls *.*~(lex|parse).[ch](^D^l1)</p>

<p>lists all files having a link count of one whose names
contain a dot (but not those starting with a dot, since
GLOB_DOTS is explicitly switched off) except for lex.c,
lex.h, parse.c and parse.h.</p>

<p>print
b*.pro(#q:s/pro/shmo/)(#q.:s/builtin/shmiltin/)</p>

<p>demonstrates how colon modifiers and other qualifiers
may be chained together. The ordinary qualifier . is applied
first, then the colon modifiers in order from left to right.
So if EXTENDED_GLOB is set and the base pattern matches the
regular file builtin.pro, the shell will ZSHPARAM(1)

<p>print shmiltin.shmo.</p>

<p>NAME zshparam - zsh parameters</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION A parameter has a name, a value, and a
number of attributes. A name may be any sequence of
alphanumeric characters and underscores, or the single
characters *, @, #, ?, -, $, or !. The value may be a scalar
(a string), an integer, an array (indexed numerically), or
an associative array (an unordered set of name-value pairs,
indexed by name). To declare the type of a parameter, or to
assign a scalar or integer value to a parameter, use the
typeset builtin.</p>

<p>The value of a scalar or integer parameter may also be
assigned by writing:</p>

<p>name=value</p>

<p>If the integer attribute, -i, is set for name, the value
is subject to arithmetic evaluation. Furthermore, by
replacing = with +=, a parameter can be added or appended
to. See the section Array Parame- ters for additional forms
of assignment.</p>

<p>To refer to the value of a parameter, write $name or
${name}. See Parameter Expansion in zshexpn(1) for complete
details.</p>

<p>In the parameter lists that follow, the mark &lt;S&gt;
indicates that the parameter is special. Special parameters
cannot have their type changed or their readonly attribute
turned off, and if a special param- eter is unset, then
later recreated, the special properties will be retained.
&lt;Z&gt; indicates that the parameter does not exist when
the shell initializes in sh or ksh emulation mode.</p>

<p>ARRAY PARAMETERS To assign an array value, write one
of:</p>

<p>set -A name value ... name=(value ...)</p>

<p>If no parameter name exists, an ordinary array parameter
is created. If the parameter name exists and is a scalar, it
is replaced by a new array. Ordinary array parameters may
also be explicitly declared with:</p>

<p>typeset -a name</p>

<p>Associative arrays must be declared before assignment,
by using:</p>

<p>typeset -A name</p>

<p>When name refers to an associative array, the list in an
assignment is interpreted as alternating keys and
values:</p>

<p>set -A name key value ... name=(key value ...)</p>

<p>Every key must have a value in this case. Note that this
assigns to the entire array, deleting any elements that do
not appear in the list.</p>

<p>To create an empty array (including associative arrays),
use one of:</p>

<p>set -A name name=()</p>

<p>Array Subscripts Individual elements of an array may be
selected using a subscript. A subscript of the form [exp]
selects the single element exp, where exp is an arithmetic
expression which will be subject to arithmetic expansion as
if it were surrounded by $((...)). The elements are numbered
beginning with 1, unless the KSH_ARRAYS option is set in
which case they are numbered from zero.</p>

<p>Subscripts may be used inside braces used to delimit a
parameter name, thus ${foo[2]} is equivalent to $foo[2] . If
the KSH_ARRAYS option is set, the braced form is the only
one that works, as bracketed expressions otherwise are not
treated as subscripts.</p>

<p>If the KSH_ARRAYS option is not set, then by default
accesses to an array element with a subscript that evaluates
to zero return an empty string, while an attempt to write
such an element is treated as an error. For backward
compatibility the KSH_ZERO_SUBSCRIPT option can be set to
cause subscript values 0 and 1 to be equivalent; see the
description of the option in zshoptions(1).</p>

<p>The same subscripting syntax is used for associative
arrays, except that no arithmetic expansion is applied to
exp. However, the parsing rules for arithmetic expressions
still apply, which affects the way that certain special
characters must be protected from interpretation. See
Subscript Parsing below for details.</p>

<p>A subscript of the form [*] or [@] evaluates to all
elements of an array; there is no difference between the two
except when they appear within double quotes.
&quot;$foo[*]&quot; evaluates to &quot;$foo[1] $foo[2]
...&quot;, whereas &quot;$foo[@]&quot; evaluates to
&quot;$foo[1]&quot; &quot;$foo[2]&quot; .... For associative
arrays, [*] or [@] evaluate to all the values, in no
particular order. Note that this does not substitute the
keys; see the documentation for the k flag under Parameter
Expansion Flags in zsh- expn(1) for complete details. When
an array parameter is referenced as $name (with no
subscript) it evaluates to $name[*], unless the KSH_ARRAYS
option is set in which case it evaluates to ${name[0]} (for
an associative array, this means the value of the key 0,
which may not exist even if there are values for other
keys).</p>

<p>A subscript of the form [exp1,exp2] selects all elements
in the range exp1 to exp2, inclusive. (Associative arrays
are unordered, and so do not support ranges.) If one of the
subscripts evaluates to a negative number, say -n, then the
nth element from the end of the array is used. Thus $foo[-3]
is the third element from the end of the array foo, and
$foo[1,-1] is the same as $foo[*].</p>

<p>Subscripting may also be performed on non-array values,
in which case the subscripts specify a substring to be
extracted. For example, if FOO is set to foobar, then echo
$FOO[2,5] prints ooba.</p>

<p>Array Element Assignment A subscript may be used on the
left side of an assignment like so:</p>

<p>name[exp]=value</p>

<p>In this form of assignment the element or range
specified by exp is replaced by the expression on the right
side. An array (but not an associative array) may be created
by assignment to a range or element. Arrays do not nest, so
assigning a parenthesized list of values to an element or
range changes the number of elements in the array, shifting
the other elements to accommodate the new values. (This is
not sup- ported for associative arrays.)</p>

<p>This syntax also works as an argument to the typeset
command:</p>

<p>typeset &quot;name[exp]&quot;=value</p>

<p>The value may not be a parenthesized list in this case;
only sin- gle-element assignments may be made with typeset.
Note that quotes are necessary in this case to prevent the
brackets from being interpreted as filename generation
operators. The noglob precommand modifier could be used
instead.</p>

<p>To delete an element of an ordinary array, assign () to
that element. To delete an element of an associative array,
use the unset command:</p>

<p>unset &quot;name[exp]&quot;</p>

<p>Subscript Flags If the opening bracket, or the comma in
a range, in any subscript expression is directly followed by
an opening parenthesis, the string up to the matching
closing one is considered to be a list of flags, as in
name[(flags)exp].</p>

<p>The flags s, n and b take an argument; the delimiter is
shown below as : , but any character, or the matching pairs
(...), {...}, [...], or &lt;...&gt;, may be used.</p>

<p>The flags currently understood are:</p>

<p>w If the parameter subscripted is a scalar then this
flag makes subscripting work on words instead of characters.
The default word separator is whitespace. This flag may not
be used with the i or I flag.</p>

<p>s:string: This gives the string that separates words
(for use with the w flag). The delimiter character : is
arbitrary; see above.</p>

<p>p Recognize the same escape sequences as the print
builtin in the string argument of a subsequent s flag.</p>

<p>f If the parameter subscripted is a scalar then this
flag makes subscripting work on lines instead of characters,
i.e. with ele- ments separated by newlines. This is a
shorthand for pwsn:.</p>

<p>r Reverse subscripting: if this flag is given, the exp
is taken as a pattern and the result is the first matching
array element, substring or word (if the parameter is an
array, if it is a scalar, or if it is a scalar and the w
flag is given, respec- tively). The subscript used is the
number of the matching ele- ment, so that pairs of
subscripts such as $foo[(r)??,3] and $foo[(r)??,(r)f*] are
possible if the parameter is not an associative array. If
the parameter is an associative array, only the value part
of each pair is compared to the pattern, and the result is
that value.</p>

<p>If a search through an ordinary array failed, the search
sets the subscript to one past the end of the array, and
hence ${array[(r)pattern]} will substitute the empty string.
Thus the success of a search can be tested by using the (i)
flag, for example (assuming the option KSH_ARRAYS is not in
effect):</p>

<p>[[ ${array[(i)pattern]} -le ${#array} ]]</p>

<p>If KSH_ARRAYS is in effect, the -le should be replaced
by -lt.</p>

<p>R Like r, but gives the last match. For associative
arrays, gives all possible matches. May be used for
assigning to ordinary array elements, but not for assign-
ing to associative arrays. On failure, for normal arrays
this has the effect of returning the element correspond- ing
to subscript 0; this is empty unless one of the options
KSH_ARRAYS or KSH_ZERO_SUBSCRIPT is in effect.</p>

<p>Note that in subscripts with both r and R pattern
characters are active even if they were substituted for a
parameter (regardless of the setting of GLOB_SUBST which
controls this feature in normal pattern matching). The flag
e can be added to inhibit pattern matching. As this flag
does not inhibit other forms of substitution, care is still
required; using a parameter to hold the key has the desired
effect:</p>

<p>key2original key print ${array[(Re)$key2]}</p>

<p>i Like r, but gives the index of the match instead; this
may not be combined with a second argument. On the left side
of an assignment, behaves like r . For associative arrays,
the key part of each pair is compared to the pattern, and
the first matching key found is the result. On failure
substitutes the length of the array plus one, as discussed
under the description of r, or the empty string for an
associative array.</p>

<p>I Like i, but gives the index of the last match, or all
possible matching keys in an associative array. On failure
substitutes 0, or the empty string for an associative array.
This flag is best when testing for values or keys that do
not exist.</p>

<p>k If used in a subscript on an associative array, this
flag causes the keys to be interpreted as patterns, and
returns the value for the first key found where exp is
matched by the key. Note this could be any such key as no
ordering of associative arrays is defined. This flag does
not work on the left side of an assignment to an associative
array element. If used on another type of parameter, this
behaves like r.</p>

<p>K On an associative array this is like k but returns all
values where exp is matched by the keys. On other types of
parameters this has the same effect as R.</p>

<p>n:expr: If combined with r, R, i or I, makes them give
the nth or nth last match (if expr evaluates to n). This
flag is ignored when the array is associative. The delimiter
character : is arbitrary; see above.</p>

<p>b:expr: If combined with r, R, i or I, makes them begin
at the nth or nth last element, word, or character (if expr
evaluates to n). This flag is ignored when the array is
associative. The delimiter character : is arbitrary; see
above.</p>

<p>e This flag causes any pattern matching that would be
performed on the subscript to use plain string matching
instead. Hence ${array[(re)*]} matches only the array
element whose value is *. Note that other forms of
substitution such as parameter sub- stitution are not
inhibited.</p>

<p>This flag can also be used to force * or @ to be
interpreted as a single key rather than as a reference to
all values. It may be used for either purpose on the left
side of an assignment.</p>

<p>See Parameter Expansion Flags (zshexpn(1)) for
additional ways to manipulate the results of array
subscripting.</p>

<p>Subscript Parsing This discussion applies mainly to
associative array key strings and to patterns used for
reverse subscripting (the r, R, i, etc. flags), but it may
also affect parameter substitutions that appear as part of
an arithmetic expression in an ordinary subscript.</p>

<p>It is possible to avoid the use of subscripts in
assignments to asso- ciative array elements by using the
syntax:</p>

<p>aa+=key with &quot;*strange*&quot; charactervalue
strin)</p>

<p>This adds a new key/value pair if the key is not already
present, and replaces the value for the existing key if it
is.</p>

<p>The basic rule to remember when writing a subscript
expression is that all text between the opening [ and the
closing ] is interpreted as if it were in double quotes (see
zshmisc(1)). However, unlike double quotes which normally
cannot nest, subscript expressions may appear inside
double-quoted strings or inside other subscript expressions
(or both!), so the rules have two important differences.</p>

<p>The first difference is that brackets ([ and ]) must
appear as bal- anced pairs in a subscript expression unless
they are preceded by a backslash ( ). Therefore, within a
subscript expression (and unlike true double-quoting) the
sequence [ becomes [ , and similarly ] becomes ]. This
applies even in cases where a backslash is not nor- mally
required; for example, the pattern [^[] (to match any
character other than an open bracket) should be written [[]
in a reverse-sub- script pattern. However, note that[] and
even [^[] mean the same thing, because backslashes are
always stripped when they appear before brackets!</p>

<p>The same rule applies to parentheses (( and )) and
braces ({ and }): they must appear either in balanced pairs
or preceded by a back- slash, and backslashes that protect
parentheses or braces are removed during parsing. This is
because parameter expansions may be surrounded by balanced
braces, and subscript flags are introduced by balanced
parentheses.</p>

<p>The second difference is that a double-quote (&quot;)
may appear as part of a subscript expression without being
preceded by a backslash, and therefore that the two
characters subscript (in true double-quoting, of the
standard shell quoting rules, any double-quotes that appear
must occur in balanced pairs unless preceded by a backslash.
This makes it more difficult to write a subscript expression
that contains an odd number of double-quote characters, but
the reason for this difference is so that when a subscript
expression appears inside true dou- ble-quotes, one can
still write</p>

<p>To use an odd number of double quotes as a key in an
assignment, use the typeset builtin and an enclosing pair of
double quotes; to refer to the value of that key, again use
double quotes:</p>

<p>typeset -A aa typeset &quot;aa[one print
&quot;$aa[one</p>

<p>It is important to note that the quoting rules do not
change when a parameter expansion with a subscript is nested
inside another subscript expression. That is, it is not
necessary to use additional backslashes within the inner
subscript expression; they are removed only once, from the
innermost subscript outwards. Parameters are also expanded
from the innermost subscript first, as each expansion is
encountered left to right in the outer expression.</p>

<p>A further complication arises from a way in which
subscript parsing is not different from double quote
parsing. As in true double-quoting, the sequences*, and@
remain as two characters when they appear in a subscript
expression. To use a literal * or @ as an associa- tive
array key, the e flag must be used:</p>

<p>typeset -A aa aa[(e)*]=star print $aa[(e)*]</p>

<p>A last detail must be considered when reverse
subscripting is per- formed. Parameters appearing in the
subscript expression are first expanded and then the
complete expression is interpreted as a pattern. This has
two effects: first, parameters behave as if GLOB_SUBST were
on (and it cannot be turned off); second, backslashes are
interpreted twice, once when parsing the array subscript and
again when parsing the pattern. In a reverse subscript, its
necessary to use four back- slashes to cause a single
backslash to match literally in the pattern. For complex
patterns, it is often easiest to assign the desired pattern
to a parameter and then refer to that parameter in the
subscript, because then the backslashes, brackets,
parentheses, etc., are seen only when the complete
expression is converted to a pattern. To match the value of
a parameter literally in a reverse subscript, rather than as
a pattern, use ${(q)name} (see zshexpn(1)) to quote the
expanded value.</p>

<p>Note that the k and K flags are reverse subscripting for
an ordi- nary array, but are not reverse subscripting for an
associative array! (For an associative array, the keys in
the array itself are interpreted as patterns by those flags;
the subscript is a plain string in that case.)</p>

<p>One final note, not directly related to subscripting:
the numeric names of positional parameters (described below)
are parsed specially, so for example $2foo is equivalent to
${2}foo. Therefore, to use sub- script syntax to extract a
substring from a positional parameter, the expansion must be
surrounded by braces; for example, ${2[3,5]} evalu- ates to
the third through fifth characters of the second positional
parameter, but $2[3,5] is the entire second parameter
concatenated with the filename generation pattern [3,5].</p>

<p>POSITIONAL PARAMETERS The positional parameters provide
access to the command-line arguments of a shell function,
shell script, or the shell itself; see the section
Invocation, and also the section Functions. The parameter n,
where n is a number, is the nth positional parameter. The
parameters *, @ and argv are arrays containing all the
positional parameters; thus $argv[n], etc., is equivalent to
simply $n.</p>

<p>Positional parameters may be changed after the shell or
function starts by using the set builtin, by assigning to
the argv array, or by direct assignment of the form n=value
where n is the number of the posi- tional parameter to be
changed. This also creates (with empty values) any of the
positions from 1 to n that do not already have values. Note
that, because the positional parameters form an array, an
array assign- ment of the form n=(value ...) is allowed, and
has the effect of shifting all the values at positions
greater than n by as many posi- tions as necessary to
accommodate the new values.</p>

<p>LOCAL PARAMETERS Shell function executions delimit
scopes for shell parameters. (Param- eters are dynamically
scoped.) The typeset builtin, and its alterna- tive forms
declare, integer, local and readonly (but not export), can
be used to declare a parameter as being local to the
innermost scope.</p>

<p>When a parameter is read or assigned to, the innermost
existing parame- ter of that name is used. (That is, the
local parameter hides any less-local parameter.) However,
assigning to a non-existent parameter, or declaring a new
parameter with export, causes it to be created in the
outermost scope.</p>

<p>Local parameters disappear when their scope ends. unset
can be used to delete a parameter while it is still in
scope; any outer parameter of the same name remains
hidden.</p>

<p>Special parameters may also be made local; they retain
their special attributes unless either the existing or the
newly-created parameter has the -h (hide) attribute. This
may have unexpected effects: there is no default value, so
if there is no assignment at the point the variable is made
local, it will be set to an empty value (or zero in the case
of integers). The following:</p>

<p>typeset PATH=/new/directory:$PATH</p>

<p>is valid for temporarily allowing the shell or
programmes called from it to find the programs in
/new/directory inside a function.</p>

<p>Note that the restriction in older versions of zsh that
local parame- ters were never exported has been removed.</p>

<p>PARAMETERS SET BY THE SHELL The following parameters are
automatically set by the shell:</p>

<p>! &lt;S&gt; The process ID of the last command started
in the background with &amp;, or put into the background
with the bg builtin.</p>

<p># &lt;S&gt; The number of positional parameters in
decimal. Note that some confusion may occur with the syntax
$#param which substitutes the length of param. Use ${#} to
resolve ambiguities. In par- ticular, the sequence $#-... in
an arithmetic expression is interpreted as the length of the
parameter -, q.v.</p>

<p>ARGC &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt; Same as #.</p>

<p>$ &lt;S&gt; The process ID of this shell. Note that this
indicates the original shell started by invoking zsh; all
processes forked from the shells without executing a new
program, such as sub- shells started by (...), substitute
the same value.</p>

<p>- &lt;S&gt; Flags supplied to the shell on invocation or
by the set or setopt commands.</p>

<p>* &lt;S&gt; An array containing the positional
parameters.</p>

<p>argv &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt; Same as *. Assigning to argv
changes the local positional parameters, but argv is not
itself a local parameter. Deleting argv with unset in any
function deletes it everywhere, although only the innermost
positional parameter array is deleted (so * and @ in other
scopes are not affected).</p>

<p>@ &lt;S&gt; Same as argv[@], even when argv is not
set.</p>

<p>? &lt;S&gt; The exit status returned by the last
command.</p>

<p>0 &lt;S&gt; The name used to invoke the current shell.
If the FUNC- TION_ARGZERO option is set, this is set
temporarily within a shell function to the name of the
function, and within a sourced script to the name of the
script.</p>

<p>status &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt; Same as ?.</p>

<p>pipestatus &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt; An array containing the
exit statuses returned by all commands in the last
pipeline.</p>

<p>_ &lt;S&gt; The last argument of the previous command.
Also, this parameter is set in the environment of every
command executed to the full pathname of the command.</p>

<p>CPUTYPE The machine type (microprocessor class or
machine model), as determined at run time.</p>

<p>EGID &lt;S&gt; The effective group ID of the shell
process. If you have suffi- cient privileges, you may change
the effective group ID of the shell process by assigning to
this parameter. Also (assuming sufficient privileges), you
may start a single command with a different effective group
ID by (EGID=gid; command)</p>

<p>EUID &lt;S&gt; The effective user ID of the shell
process. If you have suffi- cient privileges, you may change
the effective user ID of the shell process by assigning to
this parameter. Also (assuming sufficient privileges), you
may start a single command with a different effective user
ID by (EUID=uid; command)</p>

<p>ERRNO &lt;S&gt; The value of errno (see errno(3)) as set
by the most recently failed system call. This value is
system dependent and is intended for debugging purposes. It
is also useful with the zsh/system module which allows the
number to be turned into a name or message.</p>

<p>GID &lt;S&gt; The real group ID of the shell process. If
you have sufficient privileges, you may change the group ID
of the shell process by assigning to this parameter. Also
(assuming sufficient privi- leges), you may start a single
command under a different group ID by (GID=gid; command)</p>

<p>HISTCMD The current history line number in an
interactive shell, in other words the line number for the
command that caused $HISTCMD to be read.</p>

<p>HOST The current hostname.</p>

<p>LINENO &lt;S&gt; The line number of the current line
within the current script, sourced file, or shell function
being executed, whichever was started most recently. Note
that in the case of shell functions the line number refers
to the function as it appeared in the original definition,
not necessarily as displayed by the func- tions builtin.</p>

<p>LOGNAME If the corresponding variable is not set in the
environment of the shell, it is initialized to the login
name corresponding to the current login session. This
parameter is exported by default but this can be disabled
using the typeset builtin.</p>

<p>MACHTYPE The machine type (microprocessor class or
machine model), as determined at compile time.</p>

<p>OLDPWD The previous working directory. This is set when
the shell ini- tializes and whenever the directory
changes.</p>

<p>OPTARG &lt;S&gt; The value of the last option argument
processed by the getopts command.</p>

<p>OPTIND &lt;S&gt; The index of the last option argument
processed by the getopts command.</p>

<p>OSTYPE The operating system, as determined at compile
time.</p>

<p>PPID &lt;S&gt; The process ID of the parent of the
shell. As for $$, the value indicates the parent of the
original shell and does not change in subshells.</p>

<p>PWD The present working directory. This is set when the
shell ini- tializes and whenever the directory changes.</p>

<p>RANDOM &lt;S&gt; A pseudo-random integer from 0 to
32767, newly generated each time this parameter is
referenced. The random number generator can be seeded by
assigning a numeric value to RANDOM.</p>

<p>The values of RANDOM form an intentionally-repeatable
pseudo-random sequence; subshells that reference RANDOM will
result in identical pseudo-random values unless the value of
RANDOM is referenced or seeded in the parent shell in
between subshell invocations.</p>

<p>SECONDS &lt;S&gt; The number of seconds since shell
invocation. If this parameter is assigned a value, then the
value returned upon reference will be the value that was
assigned plus the number of seconds since the
assignment.</p>

<p>Unlike other special parameters, the type of the SECONDS
parame- ter can be changed using the typeset command. Only
integer and one of the floating point types are allowed. For
example, typeset -F SECONDS causes the value to be reported
as a float- ing point number. The value is available to
microsecond accu- racy, although the shell may show more or
fewer digits depending on the use of typeset. See the
documentation for the builtin typeset in zshbuiltins(1) for
more details.</p>

<p>SHLVL &lt;S&gt; Incremented by one each time a new shell
is started.</p>

<p>signals An array containing the names of the
signals.</p>

<p>TRY_BLOCK_ERROR &lt;S&gt; In an always block, indicates
whether the preceding list of code caused an error. The
value is 1 to indicate an error, 0 other- wise. It may be
reset, clearing the error condition. See Com- plex Commands
in zshmisc(1)</p>

<p>TTY The name of the tty associated with the shell, if
any.</p>

<p>TTYIDLE &lt;S&gt; The idle time of the tty associated
with the shell in seconds or -1 if there is no such tty.</p>

<p>UID &lt;S&gt; The real user ID of the shell process. If
you have sufficient privileges, you may change the user ID
of the shell by assigning to this parameter. Also (assuming
sufficient privileges), you may start a single command under
a different user ID by (UID=uid; command)</p>

<p>USERNAME &lt;S&gt; The username corresponding to the
real user ID of the shell pro- cess. If you have sufficient
privileges, you may change the username (and also the user
ID and group ID) of the shell by assigning to this
parameter. Also (assuming sufficient privi- leges), you may
start a single command under a different user- name (and
user ID and group ID) by (USERNAME=username; com- mand)</p>

<p>VENDOR The vendor, as determined at compile time.</p>

<p>ZSH_NAME Expands to the basename of the command used to
invoke this instance of zsh.</p>

<p>ZSH_PATCHLEVEL The revision string for the version
number of the ChangeLog file in the zsh distribution. This
is most useful in order to keep track of versions of the
shell during development between releases; hence most users
should not use it and should instead rely on
$ZSH_VERSION.</p>

<p>zsh_scheduled_events See the section The zsh/sched
Module in zshmodules(1).</p>

<p>ZSH_SUBSHELL Readonly integer. Initially zero,
incremented each time the shell forks to create a subshell
for executing code. Hence (print $ZSH_SUBSHELL) and print
$(print $ZSH_SUBSHELL) out- put 1, while ( (print
$ZSH_SUBSHELL) ) outputs 2.</p>

<p>ZSH_VERSION The version number of the release of
zsh.</p>

<p>PARAMETERS USED BY THE SHELL The following parameters
are used by the shell.</p>

<p>In cases where there are two parameters with an upper-
and lowercase form of the same name, such as path and PATH,
the lowercase form is an array and the uppercase form is a
scalar with the elements of the array joined together by
colons. These are similar to tied parameters cre- ated via
typeset -T . The normal use for the colon-separated form is
for exporting to the environment, while the array form is
easier to manipulate within the shell. Note that unsetting
either of the pair will unset the other; they retain their
special properties when recre- ated, and recreating one of
the pair will recreate the other.</p>

<p>ARGV0 If exported, its value is used as the argv[0] of
external com- mands. Usually used in constructs like
ARGV0=emacs nethack.</p>

<p>BAUD The rate in bits per second at which data reaches
the terminal. The line editor will use this value in order
to compensate for a slow terminal by delaying updates to the
display until neces- sary. If the parameter is unset or the
value is zero the com- pensation mechanism is turned off.
The parameter is not set by default.</p>

<p>This parameter may be profitably set in some
circumstances, e.g. for slow modems dialing into a
communications server, or on a slow wide area network. It
should be set to the baud rate of the slowest part of the
link for best performance.</p>

<p>cdpath &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt; (CDPATH &lt;S&gt;) An array
(colon-separated list) of directories specifying the search
path for the cd command.</p>

<p>COLUMNS &lt;S&gt; The number of columns for this
terminal session. Used for printing select lists and for the
line editor.</p>

<p>CORRECT_IGNORE If set, is treated as a pattern during
spelling correction. Any potential correction that matches
the pattern is ignored. For example, if the value is _* then
completion functions (which, by convention, have names
beginning with _) will never be offered as spelling
corrections. The pattern does not apply the correction of
file names, as applied by the CORRECT_ALL option (so with
the example just given files beginning with _ in the current
directory would still be completed).</p>

<p>DIRSTACKSIZE The maximum size of the directory stack. If
the stack gets larger than this, it will be truncated
automatically. This is useful with the AUTO_PUSHD
option.</p>

<p>ENV If the ENV environment variable is set when zsh is
invoked as sh or ksh, $ENV is sourced after the profile
scripts. The value of ENV is subjected to parameter
expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion
before being interpreted as a pathname. Note that ENV is not
used unless zsh is emulating sh or ksh.</p>

<p>FCEDIT The default editor for the fc builtin. If FCEDIT
is not set, the parameter EDITOR is used; if that is not set
either, a builtin default, usually vi, is used.</p>

<p>fignore &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt; (FIGNORE &lt;S&gt;) An array
(colon separated list) containing the suffixes of files to
be ignored during filename completion. However, if comple-
tion only generates files with suffixes in this list, then
these files are completed anyway.</p>

<p>fpath &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt; (FPATH &lt;S&gt;) An array
(colon separated list) of directories specifying the search
path for function definitions. This path is searched when a
function with the -u attribute is referenced. If an exe-
cutable file is found, then it is read and executed in the
cur- rent environment.</p>

<p>histchars &lt;S&gt; Three characters used by the shells
history and lexical analy- sis mechanism. The first
character signals the start of a his- tory expansion
(default !). The second character signals the start of a
quick history substitution (default ^). The third character
is the comment character (default #).</p>

<p>The characters must be in the ASCII character set; any
attempt to set histchars to characters with a
locale-dependent meaning will be rejected with an error
message.</p>

<p>HISTCHARS &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt; Same as histchars.
(Deprecated.)</p>

<p>HISTFILE The file to save the history in when an
interactive shell exits. If unset, the history is not
saved.</p>

<p>HISTSIZE &lt;S&gt; The maximum number of events stored
in the internal history list. If you use the
HIST_EXPIRE_DUPS_FIRST option, setting this value larger
than the SAVEHIST size will give you the dif- ference as a
cushion for saving duplicated history events.</p>

<p>HOME &lt;S&gt; The default argument for the cd command.
This is not set auto- matically by the shell in sh, ksh or
csh emulation, but it is typically present in the
environment anyway, and if it becomes set it has its usual
special behaviour.</p>

<p>IFS &lt;S&gt; Internal field separators (by default
space, tab, newline and NUL), that are used to separate
words which result from command or parameter expansion and
words read by the read builtin. Any characters from the set
space, tab and newline that appear in the IFS are called IFS
white space. One or more IFS white space characters or one
non-IFS white space character together with any adjacent IFS
white space character delimit a field. If an IFS white space
character appears twice consecutively in the IFS, this
character is treated as if it were not an IFS white space
character.</p>

<p>If the parameter is unset, the default is used. Note
this has a different effect from setting the parameter to an
empty string.</p>

<p>KEYTIMEOUT The time the shell waits, in hundredths of
seconds, for another key to be pressed when reading bound
multi-character sequences.</p>

<p>LANG &lt;S&gt; This variable determines the locale
category for any category not specifically selected via a
variable starting with LC_.</p>

<p>LC_ALL &lt;S&gt; This variable overrides the value of
the LANG variable and the value of any of the other
variables starting with LC_.</p>

<p>LC_COLLATE &lt;S&gt; This variable determines the locale
category for character col- lation information within ranges
in glob brackets and for sort- ing.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE &lt;S&gt; This variable determines the locale
category for character han- dling functions. If the
MULTIBYTE option is in effect this variable or LANG should
contain a value that reflects the char- acter set in use,
even if it is a single-byte character set, unless only the
7-bit subset (ASCII) is used. For example, if the character
set is ISO-8859-1, a suitable value might be en_US.iso88591
(certain Linux distributions) or en_US.ISO8859-1
(MacOS).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES &lt;S&gt; This variable determines the
language in which messages should be written. Note that zsh
does not use message catalogs.</p>

<p>LC_NUMERIC &lt;S&gt; This variable affects the decimal
point character and thousands separator character for the
formatted input/output functions and string conversion
functions. Note that zsh ignores this setting when parsing
floating point mathematical expressions.</p>

<p>LC_TIME &lt;S&gt; This variable determines the locale
category for date and time formatting in prompt escape
sequences.</p>

<p>LINES &lt;S&gt; The number of lines for this terminal
session. Used for print- ing select lists and for the line
editor.</p>

<p>LISTMAX In the line editor, the number of matches to
list without asking first. If the value is negative, the
list will be shown if it spans at most as many lines as
given by the absolute value. If set to zero, the shell asks
only if the top of the listing would scroll off the
screen.</p>

<p>LOGCHECK The interval in seconds between checks for
login/logout activity using the watch parameter.</p>

<p>MAIL If this parameter is set and mailpath is not set,
the shell looks for mail in the specified file.</p>

<p>MAILCHECK The interval in seconds between checks for new
mail.</p>

<p>mailpath &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt; (MAILPATH &lt;S&gt;) An
array (colon-separated list) of filenames to check for new
mail. Each filename can be followed by a ? and a message
that will be printed. The message will undergo parameter
expansion, command substitution and arithmetic expansion
with the variable $_ defined as the name of the file that
has changed. The default message is You have new mail. If an
element is a directory instead of a file the shell will
recursively check every file in every subdirectory of the
element.</p>

<p>manpath &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt; (MANPATH &lt;S&gt;
&lt;Z&gt;) An array (colon-separated list) whose value is
not used by the shell. The manpath array can be useful,
however, since setting it also sets MANPATH, and vice
versa.</p>

<p>module_path &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt; (MODULE_PATH &lt;S&gt;)
An array (colon-separated list) of directories that zmodload
searches for dynamically loadable modules. This is
initialized to a standard pathname, usually
/usr/local/lib/zsh/$ZSH_VER- SION. (The /usr/local/lib part
varies from installation to installation.) For security
reasons, any value set in the envi- ronment when the shell
is started will be ignored.</p>

<p>These parameters only exist if the installation supports
dynamic module loading.</p>

<p>NULLCMD &lt;S&gt; The command name to assume if a
redirection is specified with no command. Defaults to cat.
For sh/ksh behavior, change this to :. For csh-like
behavior, unset this parameter; the shell will print an
error message if null commands are entered.</p>

<p>path &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt; (PATH &lt;S&gt;) An array
(colon-separated list) of directories to search for
commands. When this parameter is set, each directory is
scanned and all files found are put in a hash table.</p>

<p>POSTEDIT &lt;S&gt; This string is output whenever the
line editor exits. It usu- ally contains termcap strings to
reset the terminal.</p>

<p>PROMPT &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt; PROMPT2 &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt;
PROMPT3 &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt; PROMPT4 &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt; Same
as PS1, PS2, PS3 and PS4, respectively.</p>

<p>prompt &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt; Same as PS1.</p>

<p>PROMPT_EOL_MARK When the PROMPT_CR and PROMPT_SP options
are set, the PROMPT_EOL_MARK parameter can be used to
customize how the end of partial lines are shown. This
parameter undergoes prompt expansion, with the
PROMPT_PERCENT option set. If not set or empty, the default
behavior is equivalent to the value %B%S%#%s%b.</p>

<p>PS1 &lt;S&gt; The primary prompt string, printed before
a command is read. It undergoes a special form of expansion
before being displayed; see EXPANSION OF PROMPT SEQUENCES in
zshmisc(1). The default is %m%# .</p>

<p>PS2 &lt;S&gt; The secondary prompt, printed when the
shell needs more informa- tion to complete a command. It is
expanded in the same way as PS1. The default is %_&gt; ,
which displays any shell constructs or quotation marks which
are currently being processed.</p>

<p>PS3 &lt;S&gt; Selection prompt used within a select
loop. It is expanded in the same way as PS1. The default is
?# .</p>

<p>PS4 &lt;S&gt; The execution trace prompt. Default is
+%N:%i&gt; , which dis- plays the name of the current shell
structure and the line num- ber within it. In sh or ksh
emulation, the default is + .</p>

<p>psvar &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt; (PSVAR &lt;S&gt;) An array
(colon-separated list) whose first nine values can be used
in PROMPT strings. Setting psvar also sets PSVAR, and vice
versa.</p>

<p>READNULLCMD &lt;S&gt; The command name to assume if a
single input redirection is specified with no command.
Defaults to more.</p>

<p>REPORTTIME If nonnegative, commands whose combined user
and system execu- tion times (measured in seconds) are
greater than this value have timing statistics printed for
them.</p>

<p>REPLY This parameter is reserved by convention to pass
string values between shell scripts and shell builtins in
situations where a function call or redirection are
impossible or undesirable. The read builtin and the select
complex command may set REPLY, and filename generation both
sets and examines its value when evalu- ating certain
expressions. Some modules also employ REPLY for similar
purposes.</p>

<p>reply As REPLY, but for array values rather than
strings.</p>

<p>RPROMPT &lt;S&gt; RPS1 &lt;S&gt; This prompt is
displayed on the right-hand side of the screen when the
primary prompt is being displayed on the left. This does not
work if the SINGLELINEZLE option is set. It is expanded in
the same way as PS1.</p>

<p>RPROMPT2 &lt;S&gt; RPS2 &lt;S&gt; This prompt is
displayed on the right-hand side of the screen when the
secondary prompt is being displayed on the left. This does
not work if the SINGLELINEZLE option is set. It is expanded
in the same way as PS2.</p>

<p>SAVEHIST The maximum number of history events to save in
the history file.</p>

<p>SPROMPT &lt;S&gt; The prompt used for spelling
correction. The sequence %R expands to the string which
presumably needs spelling correc- tion, and %r expands to
the proposed correction. All other prompt escapes are also
allowed.</p>

<p>STTY If this parameter is set in a command s
environment, the shell runs the stty command with the value
of this parameter as argu- ments in order to set up the
terminal before executing the com- mand. The modes apply
only to the command, and are reset when it finishes or is
suspended. If the command is suspended and con- tinued later
with the fg or wait builtins it will see the modes specified
by STTY, as if it were not suspended. This (inten- tionally)
does not apply if the command is continued via kill -CONT.
STTY is ignored if the command is run in the back- ground,
or if it is in the environment of the shell but not
explicitly assigned to in the input line. This avoids
running stty at every external command by accidentally
exporting it. Also note that STTY should not be used for
window size specifi- cations; these will not be local to the
command.</p>

<p>TERM &lt;S&gt; The type of terminal in use. This is used
when looking up term- cap sequences. An assignment to TERM
causes zsh to re-initial- ize the terminal, even if the
value does not change (e.g., TERM=$TERM). It is necessary to
make such an assignment upon any change to the terminal
definition database or terminal type in order for the new
settings to take effect.</p>

<p>TIMEFMT The format of process time reports with the time
keyword. The default is %E real %U user %S system %P %J.
Recognizes the following escape sequences, although not all
may be available on all systems, and some that are available
may not be useful:</p>

<p>%% A %. %U CPU seconds spent in user mode. %S CPU
seconds spent in kernel mode. %E Elapsed time in seconds. %P
The CPU percentage, computed as (100*%U+%S)/%E. %W Number of
times the process was swapped. %X The average amount in
(shared) text space used in Kbytes. %D The average amount in
(unshared) data/stack space used in Kbytes. %K The total
space used (%X+%D) in Kbytes. %M The maximum memory the
process had in use at any time in Kbytes. %F The number of
major page faults (page needed to be brought from disk). %R
The number of minor page faults. %I The number of input
operations. %O The number of output operations. %r The
number of socket messages received. %s The number of socket
messages sent. %k The number of signals received. %w Number
of voluntary context switches (waits). %c Number of
involuntary context switches. %J The name of this job.</p>

<p>A star may be inserted between the percent sign and
flags print- ing time. This cause the time to be printed in
hh:mm:ss.ttt format (hours and minutes are only printed if
they are not zero).</p>

<p>TMOUT If this parameter is nonzero, the shell will
receive an ALRM signal if a command is not entered within
the specified number of seconds after issuing a prompt. If
there is a trap on SIGALRM, it will be executed and a new
alarm is scheduled using the value of the TMOUT parameter
after executing the trap. If no trap is set, and the idle
time of the terminal is not less than the value of the TMOUT
parameter, zsh terminates. Other- wise a new alarm is
scheduled to TMOUT seconds after the last keypress.</p>

<p>TMPPREFIX A pathname prefix which the shell will use for
all temporary files. Note that this should include an
initial part for the file name as well as any directory
names. The default is /tmp/zsh.</p>

<p>watch &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt; (WATCH &lt;S&gt;) An array
(colon-separated list) of login/logout events to report. If
it contains the single word all, then all login/logout
events are reported. If it contains the single word notme,
then all events are reported as with all except $USERNAME.
An entry in this list may consist of a username, an @
followed by a remote hostname, and a % followed by a line
(tty). Any or all of these components may be present in an
entry; if a login/logout event matches all of them, it is
reported.</p>

<p>WATCHFMT The format of login/logout reports if the watch
parameter is set. Default is %n has %a %l from %m.
Recognizes the follow- ing escape sequences:</p>

<p>%n The name of the user that logged in/out.</p>

<p>%a The observed action, i.e. &quot;logged on&quot; or
&quot;logged off&quot;.</p>

<p>%l The line (tty) the user is logged in on.</p>

<p>%M The full hostname of the remote host.</p>

<p>%m The hostname up to the first .. If only the IP
address is available or the utmp field contains the name of
an X-windows display, the whole name is printed.</p>

<p>NOTE: The %m and %M escapes will work only if there is a
host name field in the utmp on your machine. Other- wise
they are treated as ordinary strings.</p>

<p>%S (%s) Start (stop) standout mode.</p>

<p>%U (%u) Start (stop) underline mode.</p>

<p>%B (%b) Start (stop) boldface mode.</p>

<p>%t %@ The time, in 12-hour, am/pm format.</p>

<p>%T The time, in 24-hour format.</p>

<p>%w The date in day-dd format.</p>

<p>%W The date in mm/dd/yy format.</p>

<p>%D The date in yy-mm-dd format.</p>

<p>%(x:true-text:false-text) Specifies a ternary
expression. The character following the x is arbitrary; the
same character is used to sepa- rate the text for the
&quot;true&quot; result from that for the &quot;false&quot;
result. Both the separator and the right paren- thesis may
be escaped with a backslash. Ternary expres- sions may be
nested.</p>

<p>The test character x may be any one of l, n, m or M,
which indicate a true result if the corresponding escape
sequence would return a non-empty value; or it may be a,
which indicates a true result if the watched user has logged
in, or false if he has logged out. Other characters evaluate
to neither true nor false; the entire expression is omitted
in this case.</p>

<p>If the result is true, then the true-text is formatted
according to the rules above and printed, and the false-text
is skipped. If false, the true-text is skipped and the
false-text is formatted and printed. Either or both of the
branches may be empty, but both separators must be present
in any case.</p>

<p>WORDCHARS &lt;S&gt; A list of non-alphanumeric
characters considered part of a word by the line editor.</p>

<p>ZBEEP If set, this gives a string of characters, which
can use all the same codes as the bindkey command as
described in the zsh/zle module entry in zshmodules(1), that
will be output to the termi- nal instead of beeping. This
may have a visible instead of an audible effect; for
example, the string e[?5e[?5l on a vt100 or xterm will have
the effect of flashing reverse video on and off (if you
usually use reverse video, you should use the
stringe[?5e[?5h instead). This takes precedence over the
NOBEEP option.</p>

<p>ZDOTDIR The directory to search for shell startup files
(.zshrc, etc), if not $HOME.</p>

<p>ZLE_REMOVE_SUFFIX_CHARS ZLE_SPACE_SUFFIX_CHARS These
parameters are used by the line editor. In certain cir-
cumstances suffixes (typically space or slash) added by the
com- pletion system will be removed automatically, either
because the next editing command was not an insertable
character, or because the character was marked as requiring
the suffix to be removed.</p>

<p>These variables can contain the sets of characters that
will cause the suffix to be removed. If
ZLE_REMOVE_SUFFIX_CHARS is set, those characters will cause
the suffix to be removed; if ZLE_SPACE_SUFFIX_CHARS is set,
those characters will cause the suffix to be removed and
replaced by a space.</p>

<p>If ZLE_REMOVE_SUFFIX_CHARS is not set, the default
behaviour is equivalent to:</p>

<p>ZLE_REMOVE_SUFFIX_CHARS=n;&amp;|</p>

<p>If ZLE_REMOVE_SUFFIX_CHARS is set but is empty, no
characters have this behaviour. ZLE_SPACE_SUFFIX_CHARS takes
precedence, so that the following:</p>

<p>ZLE_SPACE_SUFFIX_CHARS=&amp;|</p>

<p>causes the characters &amp; and | to remove the suffix
but to replace it with a space.</p>

<p>To illustrate the difference, suppose that the option
AUTO_REMOVE_SLASH is in effect and the directory DIR has
just been completed, with an appended /, following which the
user types &amp;. The default result is DIR&amp; . With
ZLE_REMOVE_SUF- FIX_CHARS set but without including &amp;
the result is DIR/&amp;. With ZLE_SPACE_SUFFIX_CHARS set to
include &amp; the result is DIR &amp;.</p>

<p>Note that certain completions may provide their own
suffix removal or replacement behaviour which overrides the
values described here. See the completion system
documentation in zsh- compsys(1). ZSHOPTIONS(1)
ZSHOPTIONS(1)</p>

<p>NAME zshoptions - zsh options</p>

<p>SPECIFYING OPTIONS Options are primarily referred to by
name. These names are case insen- sitive and underscores are
ignored. For example, allexport is equiv- alent to
A__lleXP_ort.</p>

<p>The sense of an option name may be inverted by preceding
it with no, so setopt No_Beep is equivalent to unsetopt
beep. This inversion can only be done once, so nonobeep is
not a synonym for beep. Sim- ilarly, tify is not a synonym
for nonotify (the inversion of notify).</p>

<p>Some options also have one or more single letter names.
There are two sets of single letter options: one used by
default, and another used to emulate sh/ksh (used when the
SH_OPTION_LETTERS option is set). The single letter options
can be used on the shell command line, or with the set,
setopt and unsetopt builtins, as normal Unix options
preceded by -.</p>

<p>The sense of the single letter options may be inverted
by using + instead of - . Some of the single letter option
names refer to an option being off, in which case the
inversion of that name refers to the option being on. For
example, +n is the short name of exec, and -n is the short
name of its inversion, noexec.</p>

<p>In strings of single letter options supplied to the
shell at startup, trailing whitespace will be ignored; for
example the string -f will be treated just as -f, but the
string -f i is an error. This is because many systems which
implement the #! mechanism for calling scripts do not strip
trailing whitespace.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION OF OPTIONS In the following list, options
set by default in all emulations are marked &lt;D&gt;; those
set by default only in csh, ksh, sh, or zsh emula- tions are
marked &lt;C&gt;, &lt;K&gt;, &lt;S&gt;, &lt;Z&gt; as
appropriate. When listing options (by setopt, unsetopt, set
-o or set +o), those turned on by default appear in the list
prefixed with no . Hence (unless KSH_OPTION_PRINT is set),
setopt shows all options whose settings are changed from the
default.</p>

<p>Changing Directories AUTO_CD (-J) If a command is issued
that cant be executed as a normal com- mand, and the command
is the name of a directory, perform the cd command to that
directory.</p>

<p>AUTO_PUSHD (-N) Make cd push the old directory onto the
directory stack.</p>

<p>CDABLE_VARS (-T) If the argument to a cd command (or an
implied cd with the AUTO_CD option set) is not a directory,
and does not begin with a slash, try to expand the
expression as if it were preceded by a ~ (see the section
Filename Expansion).</p>

<p>CHASE_DOTS When changing to a directory containing a
path segment .. which would otherwise be treated as
canceling the previous seg- ment in the path (in other
words, foo/.. would be removed from the path, or if .. is
the first part of the path, the last part of $PWD would be
deleted), instead resolve the path to the physical
directory. This option is overridden by CHASE_LINKS.</p>

<p>For example, suppose /foo/bar is a link to the directory
/alt/rod. Without this option set, cd /foo/bar/.. changes to
/foo; with it set, it changes to /alt. The same applies if
the current directory is /foo/bar and cd .. is used. Note
that all other symbolic links in the path will also be
resolved.</p>

<p>CHASE_LINKS (-w) Resolve symbolic links to their true
values when changing direc- tory. This also has the effect
of CHASE_DOTS, i.e. a .. path segment will be treated as
referring to the physical parent, even if the preceding path
segment is a symbolic link.</p>

<p>PUSHD_IGNORE_DUPS Don t push multiple copies of the same
directory onto the direc- tory stack.</p>

<p>PUSHD_MINUS Exchanges the meanings of + and - when used
with a number to specify a directory in the stack.</p>

<p>PUSHD_SILENT (-E) Do not print the directory stack after
pushd or popd.</p>

<p>PUSHD_TO_HOME (-D) Have pushd with no arguments act like
pushd $HOME .</p>

<p>Completion ALWAYS_LAST_PROMPT &lt;D&gt; If unset, key
functions that list completions try to return to the last
prompt if given a numeric argument. If set these func- tions
try to return to the last prompt if given no numeric argu-
ment.</p>

<p>ALWAYS_TO_END If a completion is performed with the
cursor within a word, and a full completion is inserted, the
cursor is moved to the end of the word. That is, the cursor
is moved to the end of the word if either a single match is
inserted or menu completion is per- formed.</p>

<p>AUTO_LIST (-9) &lt;D&gt; Automatically list choices on
an ambiguous completion.</p>

<p>AUTO_MENU &lt;D&gt; Automatically use menu completion
after the second consecutive request for completion, for
example by pressing the tab key repeatedly. This option is
overridden by MENU_COMPLETE.</p>

<p>AUTO_NAME_DIRS Any parameter that is set to the absolute
name of a directory immediately becomes a name for that
directory, that will be used by the %~ and related prompt
sequences, and will be available when completion is
performed on a word starting with ~. (Oth- erwise, the
parameter must be used in the form ~param first.)</p>

<p>AUTO_PARAM_KEYS &lt;D&gt; If a parameter name was
completed and a following character (normally a space)
automatically inserted, and the next charac- ter typed is
one of those that have to come directly after the name (like
}, :, etc.), the automatically added character is deleted,
so that the character typed comes immediately after the
parameter name. Completion in a brace expansion is affected
similarly: the added character is a ,, which will be removed
if } is typed next.</p>

<p>AUTO_PARAM_SLASH &lt;D&gt; If a parameter is completed
whose content is the name of a directory, then add a
trailing slash instead of a space.</p>

<p>AUTO_REMOVE_SLASH &lt;D&gt; When the last character
resulting from a completion is a slash and the next
character typed is a word delimiter, a slash, or a character
that ends a command (such as a semicolon or an amper- sand),
remove the slash.</p>

<p>BASH_AUTO_LIST On an ambiguous completion, automatically
list choices when the completion function is called twice in
succession. This takes precedence over AUTO_LIST. The
setting of LIST_AMBIGUOUS is respected. If AUTO_MENU is set,
the menu behaviour will then start with the third press.
Note that this will not work with MENU_COMPLETE, since
repeated completion calls immediately cycle through the list
in that case.</p>

<p>COMPLETE_ALIASES Prevents aliases on the command line
from being internally sub- stituted before completion is
attempted. The effect is to make the alias a distinct
command for completion purposes.</p>

<p>COMPLETE_IN_WORD If unset, the cursor is set to the end
of the word if completion is started. Otherwise it stays
there and completion is done from both ends.</p>

<p>GLOB_COMPLETE When the current word has a glob pattern,
do not insert all the words resulting from the expansion but
generate matches as for completion and cycle through them
like MENU_COMPLETE. The matches are generated as if a * was
added to the end of the word, or inserted at the cursor when
COMPLETE_IN_WORD is set. This actually uses pattern
matching, not globbing, so it works not only for files but
for any completion, such as options, user names, etc.</p>

<p>Note that when the pattern matcher is used, matching
control (for example, case-insensitive or anchored matching)
cannot be used. This limitation only applies when the
current word con- tains a pattern; simply turning on the
GLOB_COMPLETE option does not have this effect.</p>

<p>HASH_LIST_ALL &lt;D&gt; Whenever a command completion is
attempted, make sure the entire command path is hashed
first. This makes the first completion slower.</p>

<p>LIST_AMBIGUOUS &lt;D&gt; This option works when
AUTO_LIST or BASH_AUTO_LIST is also set. If there is an
unambiguous prefix to insert on the command line, that is
done without a completion list being displayed; in other
words, auto-listing behaviour only takes place when nothing
would be inserted. In the case of BASH_AUTO_LIST, this means
that the list will be delayed to the third call of the
function.</p>

<p>LIST_BEEP &lt;D&gt; Beep on an ambiguous completion.
More accurately, this forces the completion widgets to
return status 1 on an ambiguous com- pletion, which causes
the shell to beep if the option BEEP is also set; this may
be modified if completion is called from a user-defined
widget.</p>

<p>LIST_PACKED Try to make the completion list smaller
(occupying less lines) by printing the matches in columns
with different widths.</p>

<p>LIST_ROWS_FIRST Lay out the matches in completion lists
sorted horizontally, that is, the second match is to the
right of the first one, not under it as usual.</p>

<p>LIST_TYPES (-X) &lt;D&gt; When listing files that are
possible completions, show the type of each file with a
trailing identifying mark.</p>

<p>MENU_COMPLETE (-Y) On an ambiguous completion, instead
of listing possibilities or beeping, insert the first match
immediately. Then when comple- tion is requested again,
remove the first match and insert the second match, etc.
When there are no more matches, go back to the first one
again. reverse-menu-complete may be used to loop through the
list in the other direction. This option overrides
AUTO_MENU.</p>

<p>REC_EXACT (-S) In completion, recognize exact matches
even if they are ambigu- ous.</p>

<p>Expansion and Globbing BAD_PATTERN (+2) &lt;C&gt;
&lt;Z&gt; If a pattern for filename generation is badly
formed, print an error message. (If this option is unset,
the pattern will be left unchanged.)</p>

<p>BARE_GLOB_QUAL &lt;Z&gt; In a glob pattern, treat a
trailing set of parentheses as a qualifier list, if it
contains no | , ( or (if special) ~ characters. See the
section Filename Generation.</p>

<p>BRACE_CCL Expand expressions in braces which would not
otherwise undergo brace expansion to a lexically ordered
list of all the charac- ters. See the section Brace
Expansion.</p>

<p>CASE_GLOB &lt;D&gt; Make globbing (filename generation)
sensitive to case. Note that other uses of patterns are
always sensitive to case. If the option is unset, the
presence of any character which is spe- cial to filename
generation will cause case-insensitive match- ing. For
example, cvs(/) can match the directory CVS owing to the
presence of the globbing flag (unless the option
BARE_GLOB_QUAL is unset).</p>

<p>CASE_MATCH &lt;D&gt; Make regular expressions using the
zsh/regex module (including matches with =~) sensitive to
case.</p>

<p>CSH_NULL_GLOB &lt;C&gt; If a pattern for filename
generation has no matches, delete the pattern from the
argument list; do not report an error unless all the
patterns in a command have no matches. Overrides
NOMATCH.</p>

<p>EQUALS &lt;Z&gt; Perform = filename expansion. (See the
section Filename Expan- sion.)</p>

<p>EXTENDED_GLOB Treat the #, ~ and ^ characters as part of
patterns for filename generation, etc. (An initial unquoted
~ always pro- duces named directory expansion.)</p>

<p>GLOB (+F, ksh: +f) &lt;D&gt; Perform filename generation
(globbing). (See the section File- name Generation.)</p>

<p>GLOB_ASSIGN &lt;C&gt; If this option is set, filename
generation (globbing) is per- formed on the right hand side
of scalar parameter assignments of the form name=pattern
(e.g. foo=*). If the result has more than one word the
parameter will become an array with those words as
arguments. This option is provided for backwards com-
patibility only: globbing is always performed on the right
hand side of array assignments of the form name=(value)
(e.g. foo=(*)) and this form is recommended for clarity;
with this option set, it is not possible to predict whether
the result will be an array or a scalar.</p>

<p>GLOB_DOTS (-4) Do not require a leading . in a filename
to be matched explic- itly.</p>

<p>GLOB_SUBST &lt;C&gt; &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt; Treat any
characters resulting from parameter expansion as being
eligible for file expansion and filename generation, and any
characters resulting from command substitution as being
eligible for filename generation. Braces (and commas in
between) do not become eligible for expansion.</p>

<p>HIST_SUBST_PATTERN Substitutions using the :s and :&amp;
history modifiers are per- formed with pattern matching
instead of string matching. This occurs wherever history
modifiers are valid, including glob qualifiers and
parameters. See the section Modifiers in zsh- exp(1).</p>

<p>IGNORE_BRACES (-I) &lt;S&gt; Do not perform brace
expansion.</p>

<p>KSH_GLOB &lt;K&gt; In pattern matching, the
interpretation of parentheses is affected by a preceding @,
*, +, ? or !. See the sec- tion Filename Generation.</p>

<p>MAGIC_EQUAL_SUBST All unquoted arguments of the form
anything=expression appear- ing after the command name have
filename expansion (that is, where expression has a leading
~ or =) performed on expres- sion as if it were a parameter
assignment. The argument is not otherwise treated specially;
it is passed to the command as a single argument, and not
used as an actual parameter assignment. For example, in echo
foo=~/bar:~/rod, both occurrences of ~ would be replaced.
Note that this happens anyway with typeset and similar
statements.</p>

<p>This option respects the setting of the KSH_TYPESET
option. In other words, if both options are in effect,
arguments looking like assignments will not undergo word
splitting.</p>

<p>MARK_DIRS (-8, ksh: -X) Append a trailing / to all
directory names resulting from filename generation
(globbing).</p>

<p>MULTIBYTE &lt;C&gt; &lt;K&gt; &lt;Z&gt; Respect
multibyte characters when found in strings. When this option
is set, strings are examined using the system library to
determine how many bytes form a character, depending on the
cur- rent locale. This affects the way characters are
counted in pattern matching, parameter values and various
delimiters.</p>

<p>The option is on by default if the shell was compiled
with MULTIBYTE_SUPPORT except in sh emulation; otherwise it
is off by default and has no effect if turned on. The mode
is off in sh emulation for compatibility but for interactive
use may need to be turned on if the terminal interprets
multibyte characters.</p>

<p>If the option is off a single byte is always treated as
a single character. This setting is designed purely for
examining strings known to contain raw bytes or other values
that may not be characters in the current locale. It is not
necessary to unset the option merely because the character
set for the cur- rent locale does not contain multibyte
characters.</p>

<p>The option does not affect the shell s editor, which
always uses the locale to determine multibyte characters.
This is because the character set displayed by the terminal
emulator is independent of shell settings.</p>

<p>NOMATCH (+3) &lt;C&gt; &lt;Z&gt; If a pattern for
filename generation has no matches, print an error, instead
of leaving it unchanged in the argument list. This also
applies to file expansion of an initial ~ or =.</p>

<p>NULL_GLOB (-G) If a pattern for filename generation has
no matches, delete the pattern from the argument list
instead of reporting an error. Overrides NOMATCH.</p>

<p>NUMERIC_GLOB_SORT If numeric filenames are matched by a
filename generation pat- tern, sort the filenames
numerically rather than lexicographi- cally.</p>

<p>RC_EXPAND_PARAM (-P) Array expansions of the form
foo${xx}bar, where the parameter xx is set to (a b c), are
substituted with fooabar foobbar foocbar instead of the
default fooa b cbar. Note that an empty array will therefore
cause all arguments to be removed.</p>

<p>REMATCH_PCRE &lt;Z&gt; If set, regular expression
matching with the =~ operator will use Perl-Compatible
Regular Expressions from the PCRE library, if available. If
not set, regular expressions will use the extended regexp
syntax provided by the system libraries.</p>

<p>SH_GLOB &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt; Disables the special meaning
of (, |, ) and &lt; for glob- bing the result of parameter
and command substitutions, and in some other places where
the shell accepts patterns. This option is set by default if
zsh is invoked as sh or ksh.</p>

<p>UNSET (+u, ksh: +u) &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt; Treat
unset parameters as if they were empty when substituting.
Otherwise they are treated as an error.</p>

<p>WARN_CREATE_GLOBAL Print a warning message when a global
parameter is created in a function by an assignment. This
often indicates that a parame- ter has not been declared
local when it should have been. Parameters explicitly
declared global from within a function using typeset -g do
not cause a warning. Note that there is no warning when a
local parameter is assigned to in a nested func- tion, which
may also indicate an error.</p>

<p>History APPEND_HISTORY &lt;D&gt; If this is set, zsh
sessions will append their history list to the history file,
rather than replace it. Thus, multiple paral- lel zsh
sessions will all have the new entries from their his- tory
lists added to the history file, in the order that they
exit. The file will still be periodically re-written to trim
it when the number of lines grows 20% beyond the value
specified by $SAVEHIST (see also the HIST_SAVE_BY_COPY
option).</p>

<p>BANG_HIST (+K) &lt;C&gt; &lt;Z&gt; Perform textual
history expansion, csh-style, treating the char- acter !
specially.</p>

<p>EXTENDED_HISTORY &lt;C&gt; Save each command s beginning
timestamp (in seconds since the epoch) and the duration (in
seconds) to the history file. The format of this prefixed
data is:</p>

<p>:&lt;beginning time&gt;:&lt;elapsed
seconds&gt;:&lt;command&gt;.</p>

<p>HIST_ALLOW_CLOBBER Add | to output redirections in the
history. This allows his- tory references to clobber files
even when CLOBBER is unset.</p>

<p>HIST_BEEP &lt;D&gt; Beep when an attempt is made to
access a history entry which isnt there.</p>

<p>HIST_EXPIRE_DUPS_FIRST If the internal history needs to
be trimmed to add the current command line, setting this
option will cause the oldest history event that has a
duplicate to be lost before losing a unique event from the
list. You should be sure to set the value of HISTSIZE to a
larger number than SAVEHIST in order to give you some room
for the duplicated events, otherwise this option will behave
just like HIST_IGNORE_ALL_DUPS once the history fills up
with unique events.</p>

<p>HIST_FCNTL_LOCK When writing out the history file, by
default zsh uses ad-hoc file locking to avoid known problems
with locking on some oper- ating systems. With this option
locking is done by means of the system s fcntl call, where
this method is available. On recent operating systems this
may provide better performance, in par- ticular avoiding
history corruption when files are stored on NFS.</p>

<p>HIST_FIND_NO_DUPS When searching for history entries in
the line editor, do not display duplicates of a line
previously found, even if the duplicates are not
contiguous.</p>

<p>HIST_IGNORE_ALL_DUPS If a new command line being added
to the history list duplicates an older one, the older
command is removed from the list (even if it is not the
previous event).</p>

<p>HIST_IGNORE_DUPS (-h) Do not enter command lines into
the history list if they are duplicates of the previous
event.</p>

<p>HIST_IGNORE_SPACE (-g) Remove command lines from the
history list when the first char- acter on the line is a
space, or when one of the expanded aliases contains a
leading space. Note that the command lingers in the internal
history until the next command is entered before it
vanishes, allowing you to briefly reuse or edit the line. If
you want to make it vanish right away without entering
another command, type a space and press return.</p>

<p>HIST_NO_FUNCTIONS Remove function definitions from the
history list. Note that the function lingers in the internal
history until the next com- mand is entered before it
vanishes, allowing you to briefly reuse or edit the
definition.</p>

<p>HIST_NO_STORE Remove the history (fc -l) command from
the history list when invoked. Note that the command lingers
in the internal history until the next command is entered
before it vanishes, allowing you to briefly reuse or edit
the line.</p>

<p>HIST_REDUCE_BLANKS Remove superfluous blanks from each
command line being added to the history list.</p>

<p>HIST_SAVE_BY_COPY &lt;D&gt; When the history file is
re-written, we normally write out a copy of the file named
$HISTFILE.new and then rename it over the old one. However,
if this option is unset, we instead truncate the old history
file and write out the new version in-place. If one of the
history-appending options is enabled, this option only has
an effect when the enlarged history file needs to be
re-written to trim it down to size. Disable this only if you
have special needs, as doing so makes it possible to lose
his- tory entries if zsh gets interrupted during the
save.</p>

<p>When writing out a copy of the history file, zsh
preserves the old files permissions and group information,
but will refuse to write out a new file if it would change
the history files owner.</p>

<p>HIST_SAVE_NO_DUPS When writing out the history file,
older commands that duplicate newer ones are omitted.</p>

<p>HIST_VERIFY Whenever the user enters a line with history
expansion, dont execute the line directly; instead, perform
history expansion and reload the line into the editing
buffer.</p>

<p>INC_APPEND_HISTORY This options works like
APPEND_HISTORY except that new history lines are added to
the $HISTFILE incrementally (as soon as they are entered),
rather than waiting until the shell exits. The file will
still be periodically re-written to trim it when the number
of lines grows 20% beyond the value specified by $SAVE- HIST
(see also the HIST_SAVE_BY_COPY option).</p>

<p>SHARE_HISTORY &lt;K&gt;</p>

<p>This option both imports new commands from the history
file, and also causes your typed commands to be appended to
the history file (the latter is like specifying
INC_APPEND_HISTORY). The history lines are also output with
timestamps ala EXTENDED_HIS- TORY (which makes it easier to
find the spot where we left off reading the file after it
gets re-written).</p>

<p>By default, history movement commands visit the imported
lines as well as the local lines, but you can toggle this on
and off with the set-local-history zle binding. It is also
possible to create a zle widget that will make some commands
ignore imported commands, and some include them.</p>

<p>If you find that you want more control over when
commands get imported, you may wish to turn SHARE_HISTORY
off, INC_APPEND_HISTORY on, and then manually import
commands whenever you need them using fc -RI.</p>

<p>Initialisation ALL_EXPORT (-a, ksh: -a) All parameters
subsequently defined are automatically exported.</p>

<p>GLOBAL_EXPORT (&lt;Z&gt;) If this option is set, passing
the -x flag to the builtins declare, float, integer,
readonly and typeset (but not local) will also set the -g
flag; hence parameters exported to the environment will not
be made local to the enclosing function, unless they were
already or the flag +g is given explicitly. If the option is
unset, exported parameters will be made local in just the
same way as any other parameter.</p>

<p>This option is set by default for backward
compatibility; it is not recommended that its behaviour be
relied upon. Note that the builtin export always sets both
the -x and -g flags, and hence its effect extends beyond the
scope of the enclosing func- tion; this is the most portable
way to achieve this behaviour.</p>

<p>GLOBAL_RCS (-d) &lt;D&gt; If this option is unset, the
startup files /etc/zprofile, /etc/zshrc, /etc/zlogin and
/etc/zlogout will not be run. It can be disabled and
re-enabled at any time, including inside local startup files
(.zshrc, etc.).</p>

<p>RCS (+f) &lt;D&gt; After /etc/zshenv is sourced on
startup, source the .zshenv, /etc/zprofile, .zprofile,
/etc/zshrc, .zshrc, /etc/zlogin, .zlo- gin, and .zlogout
files, as described in the section Files. If this option is
unset, the /etc/zshenv file is still sourced, but any of the
others will not be; it can be set at any time to prevent the
remaining startup files after the currently execut- ing one
from being sourced.</p>

<p>Input/Output ALIASES &lt;D&gt; Expand aliases.</p>

<p>CLOBBER (+C, ksh: +C) &lt;D&gt; Allows &gt; redirection
to truncate existing files, and &gt;&gt; to create files.
Otherwise &gt;! or &gt;| must be used to truncate a file,
and &gt;&gt;! or &gt;&gt;| to create a file.</p>

<p>CORRECT (-0) Try to correct the spelling of commands.
Note that, when the HASH_LIST_ALL option is not set or when
some directories in the path are not readable, this may
falsely report spelling errors the first time some commands
are used.</p>

<p>The shell variable CORRECT_IGNORE may be set to a
pattern to match words that will never be offered as
corrections.</p>

<p>CORRECT_ALL (-O) Try to correct the spelling of all
arguments in a line.</p>

<p>DVORAK Use the Dvorak keyboard instead of the standard
qwerty keyboard as a basis for examining spelling mistakes
for the CORRECT and CORRECT_ALL options and the spell-word
editor command.</p>

<p>FLOW_CONTROL &lt;D&gt; If this option is unset, output
flow control via start/stop characters (usually assigned to
^S/^Q) is disabled in the shells editor.</p>

<p>IGNORE_EOF (-7) Do not exit on end-of-file. Require the
use of exit or logout instead. However, ten consecutive EOFs
will cause the shell to exit anyway, to avoid the shell
hanging if its tty goes away.</p>

<p>Also, if this option is set and the Zsh Line Editor is
used, widgets implemented by shell functions can be bound to
EOF (nor- mally Control-D) without printing the normal
warning message. This works only for normal widgets, not for
completion widgets.</p>

<p>INTERACTIVE_COMMENTS (-k) &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt; Allow
comments even in interactive shells.</p>

<p>HASH_CMDS &lt;D&gt; Note the location of each command
the first time it is executed. Subsequent invocations of the
same command will use the saved location, avoiding a path
search. If this option is unset, no path hashing is done at
all. However, when CORRECT is set, com- mands whose names do
not appear in the functions or aliases hash tables are
hashed in order to avoid reporting them as spelling
errors.</p>

<p>HASH_DIRS &lt;D&gt; Whenever a command name is hashed,
hash the directory containing it, as well as all directories
that occur earlier in the path. Has no effect if neither
HASH_CMDS nor CORRECT is set.</p>

<p>MAIL_WARNING (-U) Print a warning message if a mail file
has been accessed since the shell last checked.</p>

<p>PATH_DIRS (-Q) Perform a path search even on command
names with slashes in them. Thus if /usr/local/bin is in the
users path, and he or she types X11/xinit , the command
/usr/local/bin/X11/xinit will be executed (assuming it
exists). Commands explicitly beginning with / , ./ or ../
are not subject to the path search. This also applies to the
. builtin.</p>

<p>Note that subdirectories of the current directory are
always searched for executables specified in this form. This
takes place before any search indicated by this option, and
regardless of whether . or the current directory appear in
the command search path.</p>

<p>PRINT_EIGHT_BIT Print eight bit characters literally in
completion lists, etc. This option is not necessary if your
system correctly returns the printability of eight bit
characters (see ctype(3)).</p>

<p>PRINT_EXIT_VALUE (-1) Print the exit value of programs
with non-zero exit status.</p>

<p>RC_QUOTES Allow the character sequence to signify a
single quote within singly quoted strings. Note this does
not apply in quoted strings using the format $ ... , where a
backslashed sin- gle quote can be used.</p>

<p>RM_STAR_SILENT (-H) &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt; Do not query the
user before executing rm * or rm path/*.</p>

<p>RM_STAR_WAIT If querying the user before executing rm *
or rm path/*, first wait ten seconds and ignore anything
typed in that time. This avoids the problem of reflexively
answering yes to the query when one didnt really mean it.
The wait and query can always be avoided by expanding the *
in ZLE (with tab).</p>

<p>SHORT_LOOPS &lt;C&gt; &lt;Z&gt; Allow the short forms of
for, repeat, select, if, and function constructs.</p>

<p>SUN_KEYBOARD_HACK (-L) If a line ends with a backquote,
and there are an odd number of backquotes on the line,
ignore the trailing backquote. This is useful on some
keyboards where the return key is too small, and the
backquote key lies annoyingly close to it.</p>

<p>Job Control AUTO_CONTINUE With this option set, stopped
jobs that are removed from the job table with the disown
builtin command are automatically sent a CONT signal to make
them running.</p>

<p>AUTO_RESUME (-W) Treat single word simple commands
without redirection as candi- dates for resumption of an
existing job.</p>

<p>BG_NICE (-6) &lt;C&gt; &lt;Z&gt; Run all background jobs
at a lower priority. This option is set by default.</p>

<p>CHECK_JOBS &lt;Z&gt; Report the status of background and
suspended jobs before exit- ing a shell with job control; a
second attempt to exit the shell will succeed. NO_CHECK_JOBS
is best used only in combination with NO_HUP, else such jobs
will be killed automatically.</p>

<p>The check is omitted if the commands run from the
previous com- mand line included a jobs command, since it is
assumed the user is aware that there are background or
suspended jobs. A jobs command run from one of the hook
functions defined in the section SPECIAL FUNCTIONS in
zshmisc(1) is not counted for this purpose.</p>

<p>HUP &lt;Z&gt; Send the HUP signal to running jobs when
the shell exits.</p>

<p>LONG_LIST_JOBS (-R) List jobs in the long format by
default.</p>

<p>MONITOR (-m, ksh: -m) Allow job control. Set by default
in interactive shells.</p>

<p>NOTIFY (-5, ksh: -b) &lt;Z&gt; Report the status of
background jobs immediately, rather than waiting until just
before printing a prompt.</p>

<p>Prompting PROMPT_BANG &lt;K&gt; If set, ! is treated
specially in prompt expansion. See EXPANSION OF PROMPT
SEQUENCES in zshmisc(1).</p>

<p>PROMPT_CR (+V) &lt;D&gt; Print a carriage return just
before printing a prompt in the line editor. This is on by
default as multi-line editing is only possible if the editor
knows where the start of the line appears.</p>

<p>PROMPT_SP &lt;D&gt; Attempt to preserve a partial line
(i.e. a line that did not end with a newline) that would
otherwise be covered up by the com- mand prompt due to the
PROMPT_CR option. This works by outputting some
cursor-control characters, including a series of spaces,
that should make the terminal wrap to the next line when a
partial line is present (note that this is only successful
if your terminal has automatic margins, which is
typical).</p>

<p>When a partial line is preserved, by default you will
see an inverse+bold character at the end of the partial
line: a &quot;%&quot; for a normal user or a &quot;#&quot;
for root. If set, the shell parame- ter PROMPT_EOL_MARK can
be used to customize how the end of par- tial lines are
shown.</p>

<p>NOTE: if the PROMPT_CR option is not set, enabling this
option will have no effect. This option is on by
default.</p>

<p>PROMPT_PERCENT &lt;C&gt; &lt;Z&gt; If set, % is treated
specially in prompt expansion. See EXPANSION OF PROMPT
SEQUENCES in zshmisc(1).</p>

<p>PROMPT_SUBST &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt; If set, parameter
expansion, command substitution and arithmetic expansion are
performed in prompts. Substitutions within prompts do not
affect the command status.</p>

<p>TRANSIENT_RPROMPT Remove any right prompt from display
when accepting a command line. This may be useful with
terminals with other cut/paste methods.</p>

<p>Scripts and Functions C_BASES Output hexadecimal numbers
in the standard C format, for example 0xFF instead of the
usual 16#FF . If the option OCTAL_ZEROES is also set (it is
not by default), octal numbers will be treated similarly and
hence appear as 077 instead of 8#77. This option has no
effect on the choice of the output base, nor on the output
of bases other than hexadecimal and octal. Note that these
formats will be understood on input irrespective of the
setting of C_BASES.</p>

<p>C_PRECEDENCES This alters the precedence of arithmetic
operators to be more like C and other programming languages;
the section ARITHMETIC EVALUATION in zshmisc(1) has an
explicit list.</p>

<p>DEBUG_BEFORE_CMD Run the DEBUG trap before each command;
otherwise it is run after each command. Setting this option
mimics the behaviour of ksh 93; with the option unset the
behaviour is that of ksh 88.</p>

<p>ERR_EXIT (-e, ksh: -e) If a command has a non-zero exit
status, execute the ZERR trap, if set, and exit. This is
disabled while running initialization scripts.</p>

<p>The behaviour is also disabled inside DEBUG traps. In
this case the option is handled specially: it is unset on
entry to the trap. If the option DEBUG_BEFORE_CMD is set, as
it is by default, and the option ERR_EXIT is found to have
been set on exit, then the command for which the DEBUG trap
is being exe- cuted is skipped. The option is restored after
the trap exits.</p>

<p>ERR_RETURN If a command has a non-zero exit status,
return immediately from the enclosing function. The logic is
identical to that for ERR_EXIT, except that an implicit
return statement is executed instead of an exit. This will
trigger an exit at the outermost level of a non-interactive
script.</p>

<p>EVAL_LINENO &lt;Z&gt; If set, line numbers of
expressions evaluated using the builtin eval are tracked
separately of the enclosing environment. This applies both
to the parameter LINENO and the line number output by the
prompt escape %i. If the option is set, the prompt escape %N
will output the string (eval) instead of the script or
function name as an indication. (The two prompt escapes are
typically used in the parameter PS4 to be output when the
option XTRACE is set.) If EVAL_LINENO is unset, the line
number of the surrounding script or function is retained
during the evalua- tion.</p>

<p>EXEC (+n, ksh: +n) &lt;D&gt; Do execute commands.
Without this option, commands are read and checked for
syntax errors, but not executed. This option cannot be
turned off in an interactive shell, except when -n is sup-
plied to the shell at startup.</p>

<p>FUNCTION_ARGZERO &lt;C&gt; &lt;Z&gt; When executing a
shell function or sourcing a script, set $0 temporarily to
the name of the function/script.</p>

<p>LOCAL_OPTIONS &lt;K&gt; If this option is set at the
point of return from a shell func- tion, most options
(including this one) which were in force upon entry to the
function are restored; options that are not restored are
PRIVILEGED and RESTRICTED. Otherwise, only this option and
the XTRACE and PRINT_EXIT_VALUE options are restored. Hence
if this is explicitly unset by a shell function the other
options in force at the point of return will remain so. A
shell function can also guarantee itself a known shell
configuration with a formulation like emulate -L zsh ; the
-L activates LOCAL_OPTIONS.</p>

<p>LOCAL_TRAPS &lt;K&gt; If this option is set when a
signal trap is set inside a func- tion, then the previous
status of the trap for that signal will be restored when the
function exits. Note that this option must be set prior to
altering the trap behaviour in a function; unlike
LOCAL_OPTIONS, the value on exit from the function is
irrelevant. However, it does not need to be set before any
global trap for that to be correctly restored by a function.
For example,</p>

<p>unsetopt localtraps trap - INT fn() { setopt localtraps;
trapINT; sleep 3; }</p>

<p>will restore normally handling of SIGINT after the
function exits.</p>

<p>MULTI_FUNC_DEF &lt;Z&gt; Allow definitions of multiple
functions at once in the form fn1 fn2...() ; if the option
is not set, this causes a parse error. Definition of
multiple functions with the function keyword is always
allowed. Multiple function definitions are not often used
and can cause obscure errors.</p>

<p>MULTIOS &lt;Z&gt; Perform implicit tees or cats when
multiple redirections are attempted (see the section
Redirection).</p>

<p>OCTAL_ZEROES &lt;S&gt; Interpret any integer constant
beginning with a 0 as octal, per IEEE Std 1003.2-1992 (ISO
9945-2:1993). This is not enabled by default as it causes
problems with parsing of, for example, date and time strings
with leading zeroes.</p>

<p>Sequences of digits indicating a numeric base such as
the 08 component in 08#77 are always interpreted as decimal,
regard- less of leading zeroes.</p>

<p>TYPESET_SILENT If this is unset, executing any of the
typeset family of com- mands with no options and a list of
parameters that have no val- ues to be assigned but already
exist will display the value of the parameter. If the option
is set, they will only be shown when parameters are selected
with the -m option. The option -p is available whether or
not the option is set.</p>

<p>VERBOSE (-v, ksh: -v) Print shell input lines as they
are read.</p>

<p>XTRACE (-x, ksh: -x) Print commands and their arguments
as they are executed.</p>

<p>Shell Emulation BASH_REMATCH When set, matches performed
with the =~ operator will set the BASH_REMATCH array
variable, instead of the default MATCH and match variables.
The first element of the BASH_REMATCH array will contain the
entire matched text and subsequent elements will contain
extracted substrings. This option makes more sense when
KSH_ARRAYS is also set, so that the entire matched portion
is stored at index 0 and the first substring is at index 1.
Without this option, the MATCH variable contains the entire
matched text and the match array variable contains
substrings.</p>

<p>BSD_ECHO &lt;S&gt; Make the echo builtin compatible with
the BSD echo(1) command. This disables backslashed escape
sequences in echo strings unless the -e option is
specified.</p>

<p>CSH_JUNKIE_HISTORY &lt;C&gt; A history reference without
an event specifier will always refer to the previous
command. Without this option, such a history reference
refers to the same event as the previous history ref-
erence, defaulting to the previous command.</p>

<p>CSH_JUNKIE_LOOPS &lt;C&gt; Allow loop bodies to take the
form list; end instead of do list; done.</p>

<p>CSH_JUNKIE_QUOTES &lt;C&gt; Changes the rules for
single- and double-quoted text to match that of csh. These
require that embedded newlines be preceded by a backslash;
unescaped newlines will cause an error message. In
double-quoted strings, it is made impossible to escape $, or
&quot; (and itself no longer needs escaping). Command
substitutions are only expanded once, and cannot be
nested.</p>

<p>CSH_NULLCMD &lt;C&gt; Do not use the values of NULLCMD
and READNULLCMD when running redirections with no command.
This make such redirections fail (see the section
Redirection).</p>

<p>KSH_ARRAYS &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt; Emulate ksh array
handling as closely as possible. If this option is set,
array elements are numbered from zero, an array parameter
without subscript refers to the first element instead of the
whole array, and braces are required to delimit a sub-
script (${path[2]} rather than just $path[2]).</p>

<p>KSH_AUTOLOAD &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt; Emulate ksh function
autoloading. This means that when a func- tion is
autoloaded, the corresponding file is merely executed, and
must define the function itself. (By default, the function
is defined to the contents of the file. However, the most
com- mon ksh-style case - of the file containing only a
simple defi- nition of the function - is always handled in
the ksh-compatible manner.)</p>

<p>KSH_OPTION_PRINT &lt;K&gt; Alters the way options
settings are printed: instead of separate lists of set and
unset options, all options are shown, marked on if they are
in the non-default state, off otherwise.</p>

<p>KSH_TYPESET &lt;K&gt; Alters the way arguments to the
typeset family of commands, including declare, export,
float, integer, local and readonly, are processed. Without
this option, zsh will perform normal word splitting after
command and parameter expansion in argu- ments of an
assignment; with it, word splitting does not take place in
those cases.</p>

<p>KSH_ZERO_SUBSCRIPT Treat use of a subscript of value
zero in array or string expressions as a reference to the
first element, i.e. the ele- ment that usually has the
subscript 1. Ignored if KSH_ARRAYS is also set.</p>

<p>If neither this option nor KSH_ARRAYS is set, accesses
to an element of an array or string with subscript zero
return an empty element or string, while attempts to set
element zero of an array or string are treated as an error.
However, attempts to set an otherwise valid subscript range
that includes zero will succeed. For example, if
KSH_ZERO_SUBSCRIPT is not set,</p>

<p>array[0]=(element)</p>

<p>is an error, while</p>

<p>array[0,1]=(element)</p>

<p>is not and will replace the first element of the
array.</p>

<p>This option is for compatibility with older versions of
the shell and is not recommended in new code.</p>

<p>POSIX_ALIASES &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt; When this option is
set, reserved words are not candidates for alias expansion:
it is still possible to declare any of them as an alias, but
the alias will never be expanded. Reserved words are
described in the section RESERVED WORDS in zshmisc(1).</p>

<p>Alias expansion takes place while text is being read;
hence when this option is set it does not take effect until
the end of any function or other piece of shell code parsed
as one unit. Note this may cause differences from other
shells even when the option is in effect. For example, when
running a command with zsh -c, or even zsh -o posixaliases
-c, the entire command argument is parsed as one unit, so
aliases defined within the argument are not available even
in later lines. If in doubt, avoid use of aliases in
non-interactive code.</p>

<p>POSIX_BUILTINS &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt; When this option is
set the command builtin can be used to exe- cute shell
builtin commands. Parameter assignments specified before
shell functions and special builtins are kept after the
command completes unless the special builtin is prefixed
with the command builtin. Special builtins are ., :, break,
con- tinue, declare, eval, exit, export, integer, local,
readonly, return, set, shift, source, times, trap and
unset.</p>

<p>POSIX_IDENTIFIERS &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt; When this option
is set, only the ASCII characters a to z, A to Z, 0 to 9 and
_ may be used in identifiers (names of shell parameters and
modules).</p>

<p>When the option is unset and multibyte character support
is enabled (i.e. it is compiled in and the option MULTIBYTE
is set), then additionally any alphanumeric characters in
the local character set may be used in identifiers. Note
that scripts and functions written with this feature are not
portable, and also that both options must be set before the
script or function is parsed; setting them during execution
is not sufficient as the syntax variable=value has already
been parsed as a command rather than an assignment.</p>

<p>If multibyte character support is not compiled into the
shell this option is ignored; all octets with the top bit
set may be used in identifiers. This is non-standard but is
the tradi- tional zsh behaviour.</p>

<p>SH_FILE_EXPANSION &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt; Perform filename
expansion (e.g., ~ expansion) before parameter expansion,
command substitution, arithmetic expansion and brace
expansion. If this option is unset, it is performed after
brace expansion, so things like ~$USERNAME and
~{pfalstad,rc} will work.</p>

<p>SH_NULLCMD &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt; Do not use the values of
NULLCMD and READNULLCMD when doing redirections, use :
instead (see the section Redirection).</p>

<p>SH_OPTION_LETTERS &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt; If this option is
set the shell tries to interpret single letter options
(which are used with set and setopt) like ksh does. This
also affects the value of the - special parameter.</p>

<p>SH_WORD_SPLIT (-y) &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt; Causes field
splitting to be performed on unquoted parameter expansions.
Note that this option has nothing to do with word splitting.
(See the section Parameter Expansion.)</p>

<p>TRAPS_ASYNC While waiting for a program to exit, handle
signals and run traps immediately. Otherwise the trap is run
after a child pro- cess has exited. Note this does not
affect the point at which traps are run for any case other
than when the shell is waiting for a child process.</p>

<p>Shell State INTERACTIVE (-i, ksh: -i) This is an
interactive shell. This option is set upon initiali- sation
if the standard input is a tty and commands are being read
from standard input. (See the discussion of SHIN_STDIN.)
This heuristic may be overridden by specifying a state for
this option on the command line. The value of this option
can only be changed via flags supplied at invocation of the
shell. It cannot be changed once zsh is running.</p>

<p>LOGIN (-l, ksh: -l) This is a login shell. If this
option is not explicitly set, the shell is a login shell if
the first character of the argv[0] passed to the shell is a
-.</p>

<p>PRIVILEGED (-p, ksh: -p) Turn on privileged mode. This
is enabled automatically on startup if the effective user
(group) ID is not equal to the real user (group) ID. Turning
this option off causes the effec- tive user and group IDs to
be set to the real user and group IDs. This option disables
sourcing user startup files. If zsh is invoked as sh or ksh
with this option set, /etc/suid_pro- file is sourced (after
/etc/profile on interactive shells). Sourcing ~/.profile is
disabled and the contents of the ENV variable is ignored.
This option cannot be changed using the -m option of setopt
and unsetopt, and changing it inside a function always
changes it globally regardless of the LOCAL_OPTIONS
option.</p>

<p>RESTRICTED (-r) Enables restricted mode. This option
cannot be changed using unsetopt, and setting it inside a
function always changes it globally regardless of the
LOCAL_OPTIONS option. See the sec- tion Restricted
Shell.</p>

<p>SHIN_STDIN (-s, ksh: -s) Commands are being read from
the standard input. Commands are read from standard input if
no command is specified with -c and no file of commands is
specified. If SHIN_STDIN is set explic- itly on the command
line, any argument that would otherwise have been taken as a
file to run will instead be treated as a normal positional
parameter. Note that setting or unsetting this option on the
command line does not necessarily affect the state the
option will have while the shell is running - that is purely
an indicator of whether on not commands are actually being
read from standard input. The value of this option can only
be changed via flags supplied at invocation of the shell. It
can- not be changed once zsh is running.</p>

<p>SINGLE_COMMAND (-t, ksh: -t) If the shell is reading
from standard input, it exits after a single command has
been executed. This also makes the shell non-interactive,
unless the INTERACTIVE option is explicitly set on the
command line. The value of this option can only be changed
via flags supplied at invocation of the shell. It can- not
be changed once zsh is running.</p>

<p>Zle BEEP (+B) &lt;D&gt; Beep on error in ZLE.</p>

<p>COMBINING_CHARS Assume that the terminal displays
combining characters cor- rectly. Specifically, if a base
alphanumeric character is fol- lowed by one or more
zero-width punctuation characters, assume that the
zero-width characters will be displayed as modifica- tions
to the base character within the same width. Not all ter-
minals handle this. If this option is not set, zero-width
char- acters are displayed separately with special
mark-up.</p>

<p>If this option is set, the pattern test [[:WORD:]]
matches a zero-width punctuation character on the assumption
that it will be used as part of a word in combination with a
word character. Otherwise the base shell does not handle
combining characters specially.</p>

<p>EMACS If ZLE is loaded, turning on this option has the
equivalent effect of bindkey -e. In addition, the VI option
is unset. Turning it off has no effect. The option setting
is not guaran- teed to reflect the current keymap. This
option is provided for compatibility; bindkey is the
recommended interface.</p>

<p>OVERSTRIKE Start up the line editor in overstrike
mode.</p>

<p>SINGLE_LINE_ZLE (-M) &lt;K&gt; Use single-line command
line editing instead of multi-line.</p>

<p>Note that although this is on by default in ksh
emulation it only provides superficial compatibility with
the ksh line editor and reduces the effectiveness of the zsh
line editor. As it has no effect on shell syntax, many users
may wish to disable this option when using ksh emulation
interactively.</p>

<p>VI If ZLE is loaded, turning on this option has the
equivalent effect of bindkey -v . In addition, the EMACS
option is unset. Turning it off has no effect. The option
setting is not guaran- teed to reflect the current keymap.
This option is provided for compatibility; bindkey is the
recommended interface.</p>

<p>ZLE (-Z) Use the zsh line editor. Set by default in
interactive shells connected to a terminal.</p>

<p>OPTION ALIASES Some options have alternative names.
These aliases are never used for output, but can be used
just like normal option names when specifying options to the
shell.</p>

<p>-s Used by set to sort positional parameters</p>

<p>NAME zshbuiltins - zsh built-in commands</p>

<p>SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS - simple command See the section
Precommand Modifiers.</p>

<p>. file [ arg ... ] Read commands from file and execute
them in the current shell environment.</p>

<p>If file does not contain a slash, or if PATH_DIRS is
set, the shell looks in the components of $path to find the
directory containing file. Files in the current directory
are not read unless . appears somewhere in $path. If a file
named file.zwc is found, is newer than file, and is the
compiled form (created with the zcompile builtin) of file,
then commands are read from that file instead of file.</p>

<p>If any arguments arg are given, they become the
positional parameters; the old positional parameters are
restored when the file is done executing. The exit status is
the exit status of the last command executed.</p>

<p>: [ arg ... ] This command does nothing, although normal
argument expansions is performed which may have effects on
shell parameters. A zero exit status is returned.</p>

<p>alias [ {+|-}gmrsL ] [ name[=value] ... ] For each name
with a corresponding value, define an alias with that value.
A trailing space in value causes the next word to be checked
for alias expansion. If the -g flag is present, define a
global alias; global aliases are expanded even if they do
not occur in command position.</p>

<p>If the -s flags is present, define a suffix alias: if
the com- mand word on a command line is in the form
text.name, where text is any non-empty string, it is
replaced by the text value text.name. Note that name is
treated as a literal string, not a pattern. A trailing space
in value is not special in this case. For example,</p>

<p>alias -s ps=gv</p>

<p>will cause the command *.ps to be expanded to gv *.ps.
As alias expansion is carried out earlier than globbing, the
*.ps will then be expanded. Suffix aliases constitute a
different name space from other aliases (so in the above
example it is still possible to create an alias for the
command ps) and the two sets are never listed together.</p>

<p>For each name with no value, print the value of name, if
any. With no arguments, print all currently defined aliases
other than suffix aliases. If the -m flag is given the
arguments are taken as patterns (they should be quoted to
preserve them from being interpreted as glob patterns), and
the aliases matching these patterns are printed. When
printing aliases and one of the -g, -r or -s flags is
present, restrict the printing to global, regular or suffix
aliases, respectively; a regular alias is one which is
neither a global nor a suffix alias. Using + instead of -,
or ending the option list with a single +, prevents the
values of the aliases from being printed.</p>

<p>If the -L flag is present, then print each alias in a
manner suitable for putting in a startup script. The exit
status is nonzero if a name (with no value) is given for
which no alias has been defined.</p>

<p>For more on aliases, include common problems, see the
section ALIASING in zshmisc(1).</p>

<p>autoload [ {+|-}UXktz ] [ -w ] [ name ... ] Equivalent
to functions -u, with the exception of -X/+X and -w.</p>

<p>The flag -X may be used only inside a shell function,
and may not be followed by a name. It causes the calling
function to be marked for autoloading and then immediately
loaded and executed, with the current array of positional
parameters as arguments. This replaces the previous
definition of the function. If no function definition is
found, an error is printed and the func- tion remains
undefined and marked for autoloading.</p>

<p>The flag +X attempts to load each name as an autoloaded
func- tion, but does not execute it. The exit status is zero
(suc- cess) if the function was not previously defined and a
defini- tion for it was found. This does not replace any
existing defi- nition of the function. The exit status is
nonzero (failure) if the function was already defined or
when no definition was found. In the latter case the
function remains undefined and marked for autoloading. If
ksh-style autoloading is enabled, the function created will
contain the contents of the file plus a call to the function
itself appended to it, thus giving normal ksh autoloading
behaviour on the first call to the function.</p>

<p>With the -w flag, the names are taken as names of files
compiled with the zcompile builtin, and all functions
defined in them are marked for autoloading.</p>

<p>The flags -z and -k mark the function to be autoloaded
in native or ksh emulation, as if the option KSH_AUTOLOAD
were unset or were set, respectively. The flags override the
setting of the option at the time the function is
loaded.</p>

<p>bg [ job ... ] job ... &amp; Put each specified job in
the background, or the current job if none is specified.</p>

<p>bindkey See the section Zle Builtins in zshzle(1).</p>

<p>break [ n ] Exit from an enclosing for, while, until,
select or repeat loop. If n is specified, then break n
levels instead of just one.</p>

<p>builtin name [ args ... ] Executes the builtin name,
with the given args.</p>

<p>bye Same as exit.</p>

<p>cap See the section The zsh/cap Module in
zshmodules(1).</p>

<p>cd [ -qsLP ] [ arg ] cd [ -qsLP ] old new cd [ -qsLP ]
{+|-}n Change the current directory. In the first form,
change the current directory to arg, or to the value of
$HOME if arg is not specified. If arg is -, change to the
value of $OLDPWD, the previous directory.</p>

<p>Otherwise, if arg begins with a slash, attempt to change
to the directory given by arg.</p>

<p>If arg does not begin with a slash, the behaviour
depends on whether the current directory . occurs in the
list of directo- ries contained in the shell parameter
cdpath. If it does not, first attempt to change to the
directory arg under the current directory, and if that fails
but cdpath is set and contains at least one element attempt
to change to the directory arg under each component of
cdpath in turn until successful. If . occurs in cdpath, then
cdpath is searched strictly in order so that . is only tried
at the appropriate point.</p>

<p>If no directory is found, the option CDABLE_VARS is set,
and a parameter named arg exists whose value begins with a
slash, treat its value as the directory. In that case, the
parameter is added to the named directory hash table.</p>

<p>The second form of cd substitutes the string new for the
string old in the name of the current directory, and tries
to change to this new directory.</p>

<p>The third form of cd extracts an entry from the
directory stack, and changes to that directory. An argument
of the form +n identifies a stack entry by counting from the
left of the list shown by the dirs command, starting with
zero. An argument of the form -n counts from the right. If
the PUSHD_MINUS option is set, the meanings of + and - in
this context are swapped.</p>

<p>If the -q (quiet) option is specified, the hook function
chpwd and the functions in the array chpwd_functions are not
called. This is useful for calls to cd that do not change
the environ- ment seen by an interactive user.</p>

<p>If the -s option is specified, cd refuses to change the
current directory if the given pathname contains symlinks.
If the -P option is given or the CHASE_LINKS option is set,
symbolic links are resolved to their true values. If the -L
option is given symbolic links are retained in the directory
(and not resolved) regardless of the state of the
CHASE_LINKS option.</p>

<p>chdir Same as cd.</p>

<p>clone See the section The zsh/clone Module in
zshmodules(1).</p>

<p>command [ -pvV ] simple command The simple command
argument is taken as an external command instead of a
function or builtin and is executed. If the POSIX_BUILTINS
option is set, builtins will also be executed but certain
special properties of them are suppressed. The -p flag
causes a default path to be searched instead of that in
$path. With the -v flag, command is similar to whence and
with -V, it is equivalent to whence -v.</p>

<p>continue [ n ] Resume the next iteration of the
enclosing for, while, until, select or repeat loop. If n is
specified, break out of n-1 loops and resume at the nth
enclosing loop.</p>

<p>declare Same as typeset.</p>

<p>dirs [ -c ] [ arg ... ] dirs [ -lpv ] With no arguments,
print the contents of the directory stack. Directories are
added to this stack with the pushd command, and removed with
the cd or popd commands. If arguments are speci- fied, load
them onto the directory stack, replacing anything that was
there, and push the current directory onto the stack.</p>

<p>-c clear the directory stack.</p>

<p>-l print directory names in full instead of using of
using ~ expressions.</p>

<p>-p print directory entries one per line.</p>

<p>-v number the directories in the stack when
printing.</p>

<p>disable [ -afmrs ] name ... Temporarily disable the
named hash table elements. The default is to disable builtin
commands. This allows you to use an external command with
the same name as a builtin command. The -a option causes
disable to act on regular or global aliases. The -s option
causes disable to act on suffix aliases. The -f option
causes disable to act on shell functions. The -r options
causes disable to act on reserved words. Without arguments
all disabled hash table elements from the corresponding hash
table are printed. With the -m flag the arguments are taken
as pat- terns (which should be quoted to prevent them from
undergoing filename expansion), and all hash table elements
from the corre- sponding hash table matching these patterns
are disabled. Dis- abled objects can be enabled with the
enable command.</p>

<p>disown [ job ... ] job ... &amp;| job ... &amp;! Remove
the specified jobs from the job table; the shell will no
longer report their status, and will not complain if you try
to exit an interactive shell with them running or stopped.
If no job is specified, disown the current job.</p>

<p>If the jobs are currently stopped and the AUTO_CONTINUE
option is not set, a warning is printed containing
information about how to make them running after they have
been disowned. If one of the latter two forms is used, the
jobs will automatically be made running, independent of the
setting of the AUTO_CONTINUE option.</p>

<p>echo [ -neE ] [ arg ... ] Write each arg on the standard
output, with a space separating each one. If the -n flag is
not present, print a newline at the end. echo recognizes the
following escape sequences:</p>

<p>a bell character b b a c k s p a c e e escape f form
feed n linefeed (newline)r carriage return t horizontal tab
vertical tab \ backslash 0NNN character code in octal NN
character code in hexadecimal uNNNN unicode character code
in hexadecimal UNNNNNNNN unicode character code in
hexadecimal</p>

<p>The -E flag, or the BSD_ECHO option, can be used to
disable these escape sequences. In the latter case, -e flag
can be used to enable them.</p>

<p>echotc See the section The zsh/termcap Module in
zshmodules(1).</p>

<p>echoti See the section The zsh/terminfo Module in
zshmodules(1).</p>

<p>emulate [ -LR ] [ {zsh|sh|ksh|csh} [ -c arg ] ] Without
any argument print current emulation mode.</p>

<p>With single argument set up zsh options to emulate the
specified shell as much as possible. csh will never be fully
emulated. If the argument is not one of the shells listed
above, zsh will be used as a default; more precisely, the
tests performed on the argument are the same as those used
to determine the emulation at startup based on the shell
name, see the section Compatibil- ity in zshmisc(1) .</p>

<p>If the -R option is given, all options are reset to
their default value corresponding to the specified emulation
mode, except for certain options describing the interactive
environ- ment; otherwise, only those options likely to cause
portability problems in scripts and functions are altered.
If the -L option is given, the options LOCAL_OPTIONS and
LOCAL_TRAPS will be set as well, causing the effects of the
emulate command and any setopt and trap commands to be local
to the immediately sur- rounding shell function, if any;
normally these options are turned off in all emulation modes
except ksh. The -L and -c are mutually exclusive.</p>

<p>If -c arg is given, evaluate arg while the requested
emulation is temporarily in effect. The emulation and all
options will be restored to their original values before
emulate returns. The -R flag may be used.</p>

<p>Use of -c enables sticky emulation mode for functions
defined within the evaluated expression: the emulation mode
is associ- ated thereafter with the function so that
whenever the function is executed the emulation (respecting
the -R flag, if present) and all options are set before
entry to the function, and restored after exit. If the
function is called when the sticky emulation is already in
effect, either within an emulate shell -c expression or
within another function with the same sticky emulation,
entry and exit from the function do not cause options to be
altered (except due to standard processing such as the
LOCAL_OPTIONS option).</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>emulate sh -cfni() { setopt cshnullglob; } fno() { fni;
} fno</p>

<p>The two functions fni and fno are defined with sticky sh
emula- tion. fno is then executed, causing options
associated with emulations to be set to their values in sh.
fni then calls fno; because fno is also marked for sticky sh
emulation, no option changes take place on entry to or exit
from it. Hence the option cshnullglob, turned off by sh
emulation, will be turned on within fni and remain on on
return to fno. On exit from fno, the emulation mode and all
options will be restored to the state they were in before
entry to the temporary emulation.</p>

<p>The documentation above is typically sufficient for the
intended purpose of executing code designed for other shells
in a suit- able environment. More detailed rules follow. 1.
The sticky emulation environment provided by emulate shell
-c is identical to that provided by entry to a function
marked for sticky emulation as a consequence of being
defined in such an environment. Hence, for exam- ple, the
sticky emulation is inherited by subfunctions defined within
functions with sticky emulation. 2. No change of options
takes place on entry to or exit from functions that are not
marked for sticky emulation, other than those that would
normally take place, even if those functions are called
within sticky emulation. 3. No special handling is provided
for functions marked for autoload nor for functions present
in wordcode created by the zcompile command. 4. The presence
or absence of the -R flag to emulate corre- sponds to
different sticky emulation modes, so for exam- ple emulate
sh -c, emulate -R sh -c and emulate csh -c are treated as
three distinct sticky emulations.</p>

<p>enable [ -afmrs ] name ... Enable the named hash table
elements, presumably disabled ear- lier with disable. The
default is to enable builtin commands. The -a option causes
enable to act on regular or global aliases. The -s option
causes enable to act on suffix aliases. The -f option causes
enable to act on shell functions. The -r option causes
enable to act on reserved words. Without arguments all
enabled hash table elements from the corresponding hash
table are printed. With the -m flag the arguments are taken
as pat- terns (should be quoted) and all hash table elements
from the corresponding hash table matching these patterns
are enabled. Enabled objects can be disabled with the
disable builtin com- mand.</p>

<p>eval [ arg ... ] Read the arguments as input to the
shell and execute the result- ing command(s) in the current
shell process. The return status is the same as if the
commands had been executed directly by the shell; if there
are no args or they contain no commands (i.e. are an empty
string or whitespace) the return status is zero.</p>

<p>exec [ -cl ] [ -a argv0 ] simple command Replace the
current shell with an external command rather than forking.
With -c clear the environment; with -l prepend - to the
argv[0] string of the command executed (to simulate a login
shell); with -a argv0 set the argv[0] string of the command
exe- cuted. See the section Precommand Modifiers.</p>

<p>exit [ n ] Exit the shell with the exit status specified
by n; if none is specified, use the exit status from the
last command executed. An EOF condition will also cause the
shell to exit, unless the IGNORE_EOF option is set.</p>

<p>export [ name[=value] ... ] The specified names are
marked for automatic export to the envi- ronment of
subsequently executed commands. Equivalent to typeset -gx.
If a parameter specified does not already exist, it is
created in the global scope.</p>

<p>false [ arg ... ] Do nothing and return an exit status
of 1.</p>

<p>fc [ -e ename ] [ -m match ] [ old=new ... ] [ first [
last ] ] fc -l [ -nrdfEiD ] [ -t timefmt ] [ -m match ] [
old=new ... ] [ first [ last ] ] fc -p [ -a ] [ filename [
histsize [ savehistsize ] ] ] fc -P fc -ARWI [ filename ]
Select a range of commands from first to last from the
history list. The arguments first and last may be specified
as a number or as a string. A negative number is used as an
offset to the current history event number. A string
specifies the most recent event beginning with the given
string. All substitutions old=new, if any, are then
performed on the commands.</p>

<p>If the -l flag is given, the resulting commands are
listed on standard output. If the -m flag is also given the
first argu- ment is taken as a pattern (should be quoted)
and only the his- tory events matching this pattern will be
shown. Otherwise the editor program ename is invoked on a
file containing these his- tory events. If ename is not
given, the value of the parameter FCEDIT is used; if that is
not set the value of the parameter EDITOR is used; if that
is not set a builtin default, usually vi is used. If ename
is - , no editor is invoked. When editing is complete, the
edited command is executed.</p>

<p>If first is not specified, it will be set to -1 (the
most recent event), or to -16 if the -l flag is given. If
last is not spec- ified, it will be set to first, or to -1
if the -l flag is given.</p>

<p>The flag -r reverses the order of the commands and the
flag -n suppresses command numbers when listing.</p>

<p>Also when listing, -d prints timestamps for each command
-f prints full time-date stamps in the US MM/DD/YY hh:mm
format -E prints full time-date stamps in the European
dd.mm.yyyy hh:mm format -i prints full time-date stamps in
ISO8601 yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm format -t fmt prints time and date
stamps in the given format; fmt is formatted with the
strftime function with the zsh exten- sions described for
the %D{string} prompt format in the section EXPANSION OF
PROMPT SEQUENCES in zshmisc(1). The resulting formatted
string must be no more than 256 char- acters or will not be
printed. -D prints elapsed times; may be combined with one
of the options above.</p>

<p>fc -p pushes the current history list onto a stack and
switches to a new history list. If the -a option is also
speci- fied, this history list will be automatically popped
when the current function scope is exited, which is a much
better solu- tion than creating a trap function to call fc
-P manually. If no arguments are specified, the history list
is left empty, $HISTFILE is unset, and $HISTSIZE &amp;
$SAVEHIST are set to their default values. If one argument
is given, $HISTFILE is set to that filename, $HISTSIZE &amp;
$SAVEHIST are left unchanged, and the history file is read
in (if it exists) to initialize the new list. If a second
argument is specified, $HISTSIZE &amp; $SAVEHIST are instead
set to the single specified numeric value. Finally, if a
third argument is specified, $SAVEHIST is set to a separate
value from $HISTSIZE. You are free to change these
environment values for the new history list however you
desire in order to manipulate the new history list.</p>

<p>fc -P pops the history list back to an older list saved
by fc -p . The current list is saved to its $HISTFILE before
it is destroyed (assuming that $HISTFILE and $SAVEHIST are
set appro- priately, of course). The values of $HISTFILE,
$HISTSIZE, and $SAVEHIST are restored to the values they had
when fc -p was called. Note that this restoration can
conflict with making these variables &quot;local&quot;, so
your best bet is to avoid local dec- larations for these
variables in functions that use fc -p. The one other
guaranteed-safe combination is declaring these variables to
be local at the top of your function and using the automatic
option (-a) with fc -p. Finally, note that it is legal to
manually pop a push marked for automatic popping if you need
to do so before the function exits.</p>

<p>fc -R reads the history from the given file, fc -W
writes the history out to the given file, and fc -A appends
the his- tory out to the given file. If no filename is
specified, the $HISTFILE is assumed. If the -I option is
added to -R, only those events that are not already
contained within the internal history list are added. If the
-I option is added to -A or -W, only those events that are
new since last incremental append/write to the history file
are appended/written. In any case, the created file will
have no more than $SAVEHIST entries.</p>

<p>fg [ job ... ] job ... Bring each specified job in turn
to the foreground. If no job is specified, resume the
current job.</p>

<p>float [ {+|-}EFHghlprtux ] [ -LRZ [ n ]] [ name[=value]
... ] Equivalent to typeset -E, except that options
irrelevant to floating point numbers are not permitted.</p>

<p>functions [ {+|-}UXkmtuz ] [ name ... ] functions -M
mathfn [ min [ max [ shellfn ] ] ] functions -M [ -m pattern
... ] functions +M [ -m ] mathfn Equivalent to typeset -f,
with the exception of the -M option. Use of the -M option
may not be combined with any of the options handled by
typeset -f.</p>

<p>functions -M mathfn defines mathfn as the name of a
mathematical function recognised in all forms of
arithmetical expressions; see the section Arithmetic
Evaluation in zshmisc(1). By default mathfn may take any
number of comma-separated arguments. If min is given, it
must have exactly min args; if min and max are both given,
it must have at least min and and at most max args. max may
be -1 to indicate that there is no upper limit.</p>

<p>By default the function is implemented by a shell
function of the same name; if shellfn is specified it gives
the name of the corresponding shell function while mathfn
remains the name used in arithmetical expressions. The name
of the function in $0 is mathfn (not shellfn as would
usually be the case), provided the option FUNCTION_ARGZERO
is in effect. The positional parameters in the shell
function correspond to the arguments of the mathe- matical
function call. The result of the last arithmetical
expression evaluated inside the shell function (even if it
is a form that normally only returns a status) gives the
result of the mathematical function.</p>

<p>functions -M with no arguments lists all such
user-defined func- tions in the same form as a definition.
With the additional option -m and a list of arguments, all
functions whose mathfn matches one of the pattern arguments
are listed.</p>

<p>function +M removes the list of mathematical functions;
with the additional option -m the arguments are treated as
patterns and all functions whose mathfn matches the pattern
are removed. Note that the shell function implementing the
behaviour is not removed (regardless of whether its name
coincides with mathfn).</p>

<p>For example, the following prints the cube of 3:</p>

<p>zmath_cube() { (( $1 * $1 * $1 )) } functions -M cube 1
1 zmath_cube print $(( cube(3) ))</p>

<p>getcap See the section The zsh/cap Module in
zshmodules(1).</p>

<p>getln [ -AclneE ] name ... Read the top value from the
buffer stack and put it in the shell parameter name.
Equivalent to read -zr.</p>

<p>getopts optstring name [ arg ... ] Checks the args for
legal options. If the args are omitted, use the positional
parameters. A valid option argument begins with a + or a -.
An argument not beginning with a + or a -, or the argument
--, ends the options. Note that a single - is not considered
a valid option argument. optstring contains the letters that
getopts recognizes. If a letter is followed by a :, that
option is expected to have an argument. The options can be
separated from the argument by blanks.</p>

<p>Each time it is invoked, getopts places the option
letter it finds in the shell parameter name, prepended with
a + when arg begins with a +. The index of the next arg is
stored in OPTIND. The option argument, if any, is stored in
OPTARG.</p>

<p>The first option to be examined may be changed by
explicitly assigning to OPTIND. OPTIND has an initial value
of 1, and is normally reset to 1 upon exit from a shell
function. OPTARG is not reset and retains its value from the
most recent call to getopts. If either of OPTIND or OPTARG
is explicitly unset, it remains unset, and the index or
option argument is not stored. The option itself is still
stored in name in this case.</p>

<p>A leading : in optstring causes getopts to store the
letter of any invalid option in OPTARG, and to set name to ?
for an unknown option and to : when a required option is
missing. Otherwise, getopts sets name to ? and prints an
error message when an option is invalid. The exit status is
nonzero when there are no more options.</p>

<p>hash [ -Ldfmrv ] [ name[=value] ] ... hash can be used
to directly modify the contents of the command hash table,
and the named directory hash table. Normally one would
modify these tables by modifying one s PATH (for the com-
mand hash table) or by creating appropriate shell parameters
(for the named directory hash table). The choice of hash
table to work on is determined by the -d option; without the
option the command hash table is used, and with the option
the named directory hash table is used.</p>

<p>Given no arguments, and neither the -r or -f options,
the selected hash table will be listed in full.</p>

<p>The -r option causes the selected hash table to be
emptied. It will be subsequently rebuilt in the normal
fashion. The -f option causes the selected hash table to be
fully rebuilt imme- diately. For the command hash table this
hashes all the abso- lute directories in the PATH, and for
the named directory hash table this adds all users home
directories. These two options cannot be used with any
arguments.</p>

<p>The -m option causes the arguments to be taken as
patterns (which should be quoted) and the elements of the
hash table matching those patterns are printed. This is the
only way to display a limited selection of hash table
elements.</p>

<p>For each name with a corresponding value, put name in
the selected hash table, associating it with the pathname
value. In the command hash table, this means that whenever
name is used as a command argument, the shell will try to
execute the file given by value. In the named directory hash
table, this means that value may be referred to as
~name.</p>

<p>For each name with no corresponding value, attempt to
add name to the hash table, checking what the appropriate
value is in the normal manner for that hash table. If an
appropriate value can t be found, then the hash table will
be unchanged.</p>

<p>The -v option causes hash table entries to be listed as
they are added by explicit specification. If has no effect
if used with -f.</p>

<p>If the -L flag is present, then each hash table entry is
printed in the form of a call to hash.</p>

<p>history Same as fc -l.</p>

<p>integer [ {+|-}Hghilprtux ] [ -LRZ [ n ]] [ name[=value]
... ] Equivalent to typeset -i, except that options
irrelevant to integers are not permitted.</p>

<p>jobs [ -dlprs ] [ job ... ] jobs -Z string Lists
information about each given job, or all jobs if job is
omitted. The -l flag lists process IDs, and the -p flag
lists process groups. If the -r flag is specified only
running jobs will be listed and if the -s flag is given only
stopped jobs are shown. If the -d flag is given, the
directory from which the job was started (which may not be
the current directory of the job) will also be shown.</p>

<p>The -Z option replaces the shells argument and
environment space with the given string, truncated if
necessary to fit. This will normally be visible in ps
(ps(1)) listings. This fea- ture is typically used by
daemons, to indicate their state.</p>

<p>kill [ -s signal_name | -n signal_number | -sig ] job
... kill -l [ sig ... ] Sends either SIGTERM or the
specified signal to the given jobs or processes. Signals are
given by number or by names, with or without the SIG prefix.
If the signal being sent is not KILL or CONT, then the job
will be sent a CONT signal if it is stopped. The argument
job can be the process ID of a job not in the job list. In
the second form, kill -l, if sig is not specified the signal
names are listed. Otherwise, for each sig that is a name,
the corresponding signal number is listed. For each sig that
is a signal number or a number representing the exit status
of a process which was terminated or stopped by a signal the
name of the signal is printed.</p>

<p>On some systems, alternative signal names are allowed
for a few signals. Typical examples are SIGCHLD and SIGCLD
or SIGPOLL and SIGIO, assuming they correspond to the same
signal number. kill -l will only list the preferred form,
however kill -l alt will show if the alternative form
corresponds to a signal number. For example, under Linux
kill -l IO and kill -l POLL both output 29, hence kill -IO
and kill -POLL have the same effect.</p>

<p>Many systems will allow process IDs to be negative to
kill a process group or zero to kill the current process
group.</p>

<p>let arg ... Evaluate each arg as an arithmetic
expression. See the section Arithmetic Evaluation in
zshmisc(1) for a description of arithmetic expressions. The
exit status is 0 if the value of the last expression is
nonzero, 1 if it is zero, and 2 if an error occurred.</p>

<p>limit [ -hs ] [ resource [ limit ] ] ... Set or display
resource limits. Unless the -s flag is given, the limit
applies only the children of the shell. If -s is given
without other arguments, the resource limits of the cur-
rent shell is set to the previously set resource limits of
the children.</p>

<p>If limit is not specified, print the current limit
placed on resource, otherwise set the limit to the specified
value. If the -h flag is given, use hard limits instead of
soft limits. If no resource is given, print all limits.</p>

<p>When looping over multiple resources, the shell will
abort imme- diately if it detects a badly formed argument.
However, if it fails to set a limit for some other reason it
will continue try- ing to set the remaining limits.</p>

<p>resource can be one of:</p>

<p>addressspace Maximum amount of address space used.
aiomemorylocked Maximum amount of memory locked in RAM for
AIO opera- tions. aiooperations Maximum number of AIO
operations. cachedthreads Maximum number of cached threads.
coredumpsize Maximum size of a core dump. cputime Maximum
CPU seconds per process. datasize Maximum data size
(including stack) for each process. descriptors Maximum
value for a file descriptor. filesize Largest single file
allowed. maxproc Maximum number of processes. maxpthreads
Maximum number of threads per process. memorylocked Maximum
amount of memory locked in RAM. memoryuse Maximum resident
set size. msgqueue Maximum number of bytes in POSIX message
queues. resident Maximum resident set size. sigpending
Maximum number of pending signals. sockbufsize Maximum size
of all socket buffers. stacksize Maximum stack size for each
process. vmemorysize Maximum amount of virtual memory.</p>

<p>Which of these resource limits are available depends on
the sys- tem. resource can be abbreviated to any unambiguous
prefix. It can also be an integer, which corresponds to the
integer defined for the resource by the operating
system.</p>

<p>If argument corresponds to a number which is out of the
range of the resources configured into the shell, the shell
will try to read or write the limit anyway, and will report
an error if this fails. As the shell does not store such
resources internally, an attempt to set the limit will fail
unless the -s option is present.</p>

<p>limit is a number, with an optional scaling factor, as
follows:</p>

<p>nh hours nk kilobytes (default) nm megabytes or minutes
[mm:]ss minutes and seconds</p>

<p>local [ {+|-}AEFHUahlprtux ] [ -LRZi [ n ]] [
name[=value] ] ... Same as typeset, except that the options
-g, and -f are not per- mitted. In this case the -x option
does not force the use of -g, i.e. exported variables will
be local to functions.</p>

<p>log List all users currently logged in who are affected
by the cur- rent setting of the watch parameter.</p>

<p>logout [ n ] Same as exit, except that it only works in
a login shell.</p>

<p>noglob simple command See the section Precommand
Modifiers.</p>

<p>popd [ [-q] {+|-}n ] Remove an entry from the directory
stack, and perform a cd to the new top directory. With no
argument, the current top entry is removed. An argument of
the form +n identifies a stack entry by counting from the
left of the list shown by the dirs command, starting with
zero. An argument of the form -n counts from the right. If
the PUSHD_MINUS option is set, the meanings of + and - in
this context are swapped.</p>

<p>If the -q (quiet) option is specified, the hook function
chpwd and the functions in the array $chpwd_functions are
not called, and the new directory stack is not printed. This
is useful for calls to popd that do not change the
environment seen by an interactive user.</p>

<p>print [ -abcDilmnNoOpPrsz ] [ -u n ] [ -f format ] [ -C
cols ] [ -R [ -en ]] [ arg ... ] With the -f option the
arguments are printed as described by printf. With no flags
or with the flag - , the arguments are printed on the
standard output as described by echo, with the following
differences: the escape sequence M-x metafies the character
x (sets the highest bit),-x produces a control character -@
and -? give the characters NUL and delete), andE is a
synonym fore. Finally, if not in an escape sequence, escapes
the following character and is not printed.</p>

<p>-a Print arguments with the column incrementing first.
Only useful with the -c and -C options.</p>

<p>-b Recognize all the escape sequences defined for the
bind- key command, see zshzle(1).</p>

<p>-c Print the arguments in columns. Unless -a is also
given, arguments are printed with the row incrementing
first.</p>

<p>-C cols Print the arguments in cols columns. Unless -a
is also given, arguments are printed with the row
incrementing first.</p>

<p>-D Treat the arguments as directory names, replacing
pre- fixes with ~ expressions, as appropriate.</p>

<p>-i If given together with -o or -O, sorting is performed
case-independently.</p>

<p>-l Print the arguments separated by newlines instead of
spaces.</p>

<p>-m Take the first argument as a pattern (should be
quoted), and remove it from the argument list together with
subse- quent arguments that do not match this pattern.</p>

<p>-n Do not add a newline to the output.</p>

<p>-N Print the arguments separated and terminated by
nulls.</p>

<p>-o Print the arguments sorted in ascending order.</p>

<p>-O Print the arguments sorted in descending order.</p>

<p>-p Print the arguments to the input of the
coprocess.</p>

<p>-P Perform prompt expansion (see EXPANSION OF PROMPT
SEQUENCES in zshmisc(1)).</p>

<p>-r Ignore the escape conventions of echo.</p>

<p>-R Emulate the BSD echo command, which does not process
escape sequences unless the -e flag is given. The -n flag
suppresses the trailing newline. Only the -e and -n flags
are recognized after -R; all other arguments and options are
printed.</p>

<p>-s Place the results in the history list instead of on
the standard output.</p>

<p>-u n Print the arguments to file descriptor n.</p>

<p>-z Push the arguments onto the editing buffer stack,
sepa- rated by spaces.</p>

<p>If any of -m, -o or -O are used in combination with -f
and there are no arguments (after the removal process in the
case of -m) then nothing is printed.</p>

<p>printf format [ arg ... ] Print the arguments according
to the format specification. For- matting rules are the same
as used in C. The same escape sequences as for echo are
recognised in the format. All C con- version specifications
ending in one of csdiouxXeEfgGn are han- dled. In addition
to this, %b can be used instead of %s to cause escape
sequences in the argument to be recognised and %q can be
used to quote the argument in such a way that allows it to
be reused as shell input. With the numeric format
specifiers, if the corresponding argument starts with a
quote character, the numeric value of the following
character is used as the number to print otherwise the
argument is evaluated as an arithmetic expression. See the
section Arithmetic Evaluation in zsh- misc(1) for a
description of arithmetic expressions. With %n, the
corresponding argument is taken as an identifier which is
created as an integer parameter.</p>

<p>Normally, conversion specifications are applied to each
argument in order but they can explicitly specify the nth
argument is to be used by replacing % by %n$ and * by *n$.
It is rec- ommended that you do not mix references of this
explicit style with the normal style and the handling of
such mixed styles may be subject to future change.</p>

<p>If arguments remain unused after formatting, the format
string is reused until all arguments have been consumed.
With the print builtin, this can be suppressed by using the
-r option. If more arguments are required by the format than
have been specified, the behaviour is as if zero or an empty
string had been speci- fied as the argument.</p>

<p>pushd [ -qsLP ] [ arg ] pushd [ -qsLP ] old new pushd [
-qsLP ] {+|-}n Change the current directory, and push the
old current directory onto the directory stack. In the first
form, change the current directory to arg. If arg is not
specified, change to the second directory on the stack (that
is, exchange the top two entries), or change to $HOME if the
PUSHD_TO_HOME option is set or if there is only one entry on
the stack. Otherwise, arg is inter- preted as it would be by
cd. The meaning of old and new in the second form is also
the same as for cd.</p>

<p>The third form of pushd changes directory by rotating
the direc- tory list. An argument of the form +n identifies
a stack entry by counting from the left of the list shown by
the dirs command, starting with zero. An argument of the
form -n counts from the right. If the PUSHD_MINUS option is
set, the meanings of + and - in this context are
swapped.</p>

<p>If the -q (quiet) option is specified, the hook function
chpwd and the functions in the array $chpwd_functions are
not called, and the new directory stack is not printed. This
is useful for calls to pushd that do not change the
environment seen by an interactive user.</p>

<p>If the option -q is not specified and the shell option
PUSHD_SILENT is not set, the directory stack will be printed
after a pushd is performed.</p>

<p>The options -s, -L and -P have the same meanings as for
the cd builtin.</p>

<p>pushln [ arg ... ] Equivalent to print -nz.</p>

<p>pwd [ -rLP ] Print the absolute pathname of the current
working directory. If the -r or the -P flag is specified, or
the CHASE_LINKS option is set and the -L flag is not given,
the printed path will not contain symbolic links.</p>

<p>r Same as fc -e -.</p>

<p>read [ -rszpqAclneE ] [ -t [ num ] ] [ -k [ num ] ] [ -d
delim ] [ -u n ] [ name[?prompt] ] [ name ... ] Read one
line and break it into fields using the characters in $IFS
as separators, except as noted below. The first field is
assigned to the first name, the second field to the second
name, etc., with leftover fields assigned to the last name.
If name is omitted then REPLY is used for scalars and reply
for arrays.</p>

<p>-r Raw mode: a at the end of a line does not signify
line continuation and backslashes in the line dont quote the
following character and are not removed.</p>

<p>-s Don t echo back characters if reading from the
terminal. Currently does not work with the -q option.</p>

<p>-q Read only one character from the terminal and set
name to y if this character was y or Y and to n other- wise.
With this flag set the return status is zero only if the
character was y or Y . Note that this always reads from the
terminal, even if used with the -p or -u or -z flags or with
redirected input. This option may also be used within zle
widgets.</p>

<p>-k [ num ] Read only one (or num) characters. All are
assigned to the first name, without word splitting. This
flag is ignored when -q is present. Input is read from the
ter- minal unless one of -u or -p is present. This option
may also be used within zle widgets.</p>

<p>Note that despite the mnemonic key this option does read
full characters, which may consist of multiple bytes if the
option MULTIBYTE is set.</p>

<p>-z Read one entry from the editor buffer stack and
assign it to the first name, without word splitting. Text is
pushed onto the stack with print -z or with push-line from
the line editor (see zshzle(1)). This flag is ignored when
the -k or -q flags are present.</p>

<p>-e -E The input read is printed (echoed) to the standard
out- put. If the -e flag is used, no input is assigned to
the parameters.</p>

<p>-A The first name is taken as the name of an array and
all words are assigned to it.</p>

<p>-c -l These flags are allowed only if called inside a
function used for completion (specified with the -K flag to
com- pctl). If the -c flag is given, the words of the
current command are read. If the -l flag is given, the whole
line is assigned as a scalar. If both flags are present, -l
is used and -c is ignored.</p>

<p>-n Together with -c, the number of the word the cursor
is on is read. With -l, the index of the character the
cursor is on is read. Note that the command name is word
number 1, not word 0, and that when the cursor is at the end
of the line, its character index is the length of the line
plus one.</p>

<p>-u n Input is read from file descriptor n.</p>

<p>-p Input is read from the coprocess.</p>

<p>-d delim Input is terminated by the first character of
delim instead of by newline.</p>

<p>-t [ num ] Test if input is available before attempting
to read. If num is present, it must begin with a digit and
will be evaluated to give a number of seconds, which may be
a floating point number; in this case the read times out if
input is not available within this time. If num is not
present, it is taken to be zero, so that read returns
immediately if no input is available. If no input is
available, return status 1 and do not set any variables.</p>

<p>This option is not available when reading from the
editor buffer with -z, when called from within completion
with -c or -l, with -q which clears the input queue before
reading, or within zle where other mechanisms should be used
to test for input.</p>

<p>Note that read does not attempt to alter the input pro-
cessing mode. The default mode is canonical input, in which
an entire line is read at a time, so usually read -t will
not read anything until an entire line has been typed.
However, when reading from the terminal with -k input is
processed one key at a time; in this case, only availability
of the first character is tested, so that e.g. read -t -k 2
can still block on the second charac- ter. Use two instances
of read -t -k if this is not what is wanted. If the first
argument contains a ?, the remainder of this word is used as
a prompt on stan- dard error when the shell is
interactive.</p>

<p>The value (exit status) of read is 1 when an end-of-file
is encountered, or when -c or -l is present and the command
is not called from a compctl function, or as described for
-q. Other- wise the value is 0.</p>

<p>The behavior of some combinations of the -k, -p, -q, -u
and -z flags is undefined. Presently -q cancels all the
others, -p cancels -u, -k cancels -z, and otherwise -z
cancels both -p and -u.</p>

<p>The -c or -l flags cancel any and all of -kpquz.</p>

<p>readonly Same as typeset -r.</p>

<p>rehash Same as hash -r.</p>

<p>return [ n ] Causes a shell function or . script to
return to the invoking script with the return status
specified by n. If n is omitted, the return status is that
of the last command executed.</p>

<p>If return was executed from a trap in a TRAPNAL
function, the effect is different for zero and non-zero
return status. With zero status (or after an implicit return
at the end of the trap), the shell will return to whatever
it was previously pro- cessing; with a non-zero status, the
shell will behave as inter- rupted except that the return
status of the trap is retained. Note that the numeric value
of the signal which caused the trap is passed as the first
argument, so the statement return $((128+$1)) will return
the same status as if the signal had not been trapped.</p>

<p>sched See the section The zsh/sched Module in
zshmodules(1).</p>

<p>set [ {+|-}options | {+|-}o [ option_name ] ] ... [
{+|-}A [ name ] ] [ arg ... ] Set the options for the shell
and/or set the positional parame- ters, or declare and set
an array. If the -s option is given, it causes the specified
arguments to be sorted before assigning them to the
positional parameters (or to the array name if -A is used).
With +s sort arguments in descending order. For the meaning
of the other flags, see zshoptions(1). Flags may be
specified by name using the -o option. If no option name is
sup- plied with -o, the current option states are printed:
see the description of setopt below for more information on
the format. With +o they are printed in a form that can be
used as input to the shell.</p>

<p>If the -A flag is specified, name is set to an array
containing the given args; if no name is specified, all
arrays are printed together with their values.</p>

<p>If +A is used and name is an array, the given arguments
will replace the initial elements of that array; if no name
is speci- fied, all arrays are printed without their
values.</p>

<p>The behaviour of arguments after -A name or +A name
depends on whether the option KSH_ARRAYS is set. If it is
not set, all arguments following name are treated as values
for the array, regardless of their form. If the option is
set, normal option processing continues at that point; only
regular arguments are treated as values for the array. This
means that</p>

<p>set -A array -x -- foo</p>

<p>sets array to -x -- foo if KSH_ARRAYS is not set, but
sets the array to foo and turns on the option -x if it is
set.</p>

<p>If the -A flag is not present, but there are arguments
beyond the options, the positional parameters are set. If
the option list (if any) is terminated by --, and there are
no further arguments, the positional parameters will be
unset.</p>

<p>If no arguments and no -- are given, then the names and
values of all parameters are printed on the standard output.
If the only argument is +, the names of all parameters are
printed.</p>

<p>For historical reasons, set - is treated as set +xv and
set - args as set +xv -- args when in any other emulation
mode than zshs native mode.</p>

<p>setcap See the section The zsh/cap Module in
zshmodules(1).</p>

<p>setopt [ {+|-}options | {+|-}o option_name ] [ name ...
] Set the options for the shell. All options specified
either with flags or by name are set.</p>

<p>If no arguments are supplied, the names of all options
currently set are printed. The form is chosen so as to
minimize the dif- ferences from the default options for the
current emulation (the default emulation being native zsh,
shown as &lt;Z&gt; in zshop- tions(1)). Options that are on
by default for the emulation are shown with the prefix no
only if they are off, while other options are shown without
the prefix no and only if they are on. In addition to
options changed from the default state by the user, any
options activated automatically by the shell (for example,
SHIN_STDIN or INTERACTIVE) will be shown in the list. The
format is further modified by the option KSH_OPTION_PRINT,
however the rationale for choosing options with or without
the no prefix remains the same in this case.</p>

<p>If the -m flag is given the arguments are taken as
patterns (which should be quoted to protect them from
filename expan- sion), and all options with names matching
these patterns are set.</p>

<p>shift [ n ] [ name ... ] The positional parameters
${n+1} ... are renamed to $1 ..., where n is an arithmetic
expression that defaults to 1. If any names are given then
the arrays with these names are shifted instead of the
positional parameters.</p>

<p>source file [ arg ... ] Same as ., except that the
current directory is always searched and is always searched
first, before directories in $path.</p>

<p>stat See the section The zsh/stat Module in
zshmodules(1).</p>

<p>suspend [ -f ] Suspend the execution of the shell (send
it a SIGTSTP) until it receives a SIGCONT. Unless the -f
option is given, this will refuse to suspend a login
shell.</p>

<p>test [ arg ... ] [ [ arg ... ] ] Like the system version
of test. Added for compatibility; use conditional
expressions instead (see the section Conditional Expressions
). The main differences between the conditional expression
syntax and the test and [ builtins are: these com- mands are
not handled syntactically, so for example an empty variable
expansion may cause an argument to be omitted; syntax errors
cause status 2 to be returned instead of a shell error; and
arithmetic operators expect integer arguments rather than
arithmetic expressions.</p>

<p>The command attempts to implement POSIX and its
extensions where these are specified. Unfortunately there
are intrinsic ambigui- ties in the syntax; in particular
there is no distinction between test operators and strings
that resemble them. The standard attempts to resolve these
for small numbers of argu- ments (up to four); for five or
more arguments compatibility cannot be relied on. Users are
urged wherever possible to use the [[ test syntax which does
not have these ambiguities.</p>

<p>times Print the accumulated user and system times for
the shell and for processes run from the shell.</p>

<p>trap [ arg ] [ sig ... ] arg is a series of commands
(usually quoted to protect it from immediate evaluation by
the shell) to be read and executed when the shell receives
any of the signals specified by one or more sig args. Each
sig can be given as a number, or as the name of a signal
either with or without the string SIG in front (e.g. 1, HUP,
and SIGHUP are all the same signal).</p>

<p>If arg is -, then the specified signals are reset to
their defaults, or, if no sig args are present, all traps
are reset.</p>

<p>If arg is an empty string, then the specified signals
are ignored by the shell (and by the commands it
invokes).</p>

<p>If arg is omitted but one or more sig args are provided
(i.e. the first argument is a valid signal number or name),
the effect is the same as if arg had been specified as
-.</p>

<p>The trap command with no arguments prints a list of
commands associated with each signal.</p>

<p>If sig is ZERR then arg will be executed after each
command with a nonzero exit status. ERR is an alias for ZERR
on systems that have no SIGERR signal (this is the usual
case).</p>

<p>If sig is DEBUG then arg will be executed before each
command if the option DEBUG_BEFORE_CMD is set (as it is by
default), else after each command. Here, a command is what
is described as a sublist in the shell grammar, see the
section SIMPLE COMMANDS &amp; PIPELINES in zshmisc(1). If
DEBUG_BEFORE_CMD is set various additional features are
available. First, it is possible to skip the next command by
setting the option ERR_EXIT; see the description of the
ERR_EXIT option in zshoptions(1). Also, the shell parameter
ZSH_DEBUG_CMD is set to the string corresponding to the
command to be executed following the trap. Note that this
string is reconstructed from the internal format and may not
be formatted the same way as the original text. The parame-
ter is unset after the trap is executed.</p>

<p>If sig is 0 or EXIT and the trap statement is executed
inside the body of a function, then the command arg is
executed after the function completes. The value of $? at
the start of execu- tion is the exit status of the shell or
the return status of the function exiting. If sig is 0 or
EXIT and the trap statement is not executed inside the body
of a function, then the command arg is executed when the
shell terminates.</p>

<p>ZERR, DEBUG, and EXIT traps are not executed inside
other traps. ZERR and DEBUG traps are kept within subshells,
while other traps are reset.</p>

<p>Note that traps defined with the trap builtin are
slightly dif- ferent from those defined as TRAPNAL () { ...
}, as the latter have their own function environment (line
numbers, local vari- ables, etc.) while the former use the
environment of the command in which they were called. For
example,</p>

<p>trapprint $LINENODEBUG</p>

<p>will print the line number of a command executed after
it has run, while</p>

<p>TRAPDEBUG() { print $LINENO; }</p>

<p>will always print the number zero.</p>

<p>Alternative signal names are allowed as described under
kill above. Defining a trap under either name causes any
trap under an alternative name to be removed. However, it is
recommended that for consistency users stick exclusively to
one name or another.</p>

<p>true [ arg ... ] Do nothing and return an exit status of
0.</p>

<p>ttyctl -fu The -f option freezes the tty, and -u
unfreezes it. When the tty is frozen, no changes made to the
tty settings by external programs will be honored by the
shell, except for changes in the size of the screen; the
shell will simply reset the settings to their previous
values as soon as each command exits or is sus- pended.
Thus, stty and similar programs have no effect when the tty
is frozen. Without options it reports whether the terminal
is frozen or not.</p>

<p>type [ -wfpams ] name ... Equivalent to whence -v.</p>

<p>typeset [ {+|-}AEFHUafghklprtuxmz ] [ -LRZi [ n ]] [
name[=value] ... ] typeset -T [ {+|-}Urux ] [ -LRZ [ n ]]
SCALAR[=value] array [ sep ] Set or display attributes and
values for shell parameters.</p>

<p>A parameter is created for each name that does not
already refer to one. When inside a function, a new
parameter is created for every name (even those that already
exist), and is unset again when the function completes. See
Local Parameters in zsh- param(1). The same rules apply to
special shell parameters, which retain their special
attributes when made local.</p>

<p>For each name=value assignment, the parameter name is
set to value. Note that arrays currently cannot be assigned
in typeset expressions, only scalars and integers. Unless
the option KSH_TYPESET is set, normal expansion rules apply
to assignment arguments, so value may be split into separate
words; if the option is set, assignments which can be
recognised when expan- sion is performed are treated as
single words. For example the command typeset vbl=$(echo one
two) is treated as having one argument if KSH_TYPESET is
set, but otherwise is treated as hav- ing the two arguments
vbl=one and two.</p>

<p>If the shell option TYPESET_SILENT is not set, for each
remain- ing name that refers to a parameter that is set, the
name and value of the parameter are printed in the form of
an assignment. Nothing is printed for newly-created
parameters, or when any attribute flags listed below are
given along with the name. Using + instead of minus to
introduce an attribute turns it off.</p>

<p>If the -p option is given, parameters and values are
printed in the form of a typeset command and an assignment
(which will be printed separately for arrays and associative
arrays), regard- less of other flags and options. Note that
the -h flag on parameters is respected; no value will be
shown for these param- eters.</p>

<p>If the -T option is given, two or three arguments must
be present (an exception is that zero arguments are allowed
to show the list of parameters created in this fashion). The
first two are the name of a scalar and an array parameter
(in that order) that will be tied together in the manner of
$PATH and $path. The optional third argument is a
single-character separator which will be used to join the
elements of the array to form the scalar; if absent, a colon
is used, as with $PATH. Only the first character of the
separator is significant; any remaining characters are
ignored. Only the scalar parameter may be assigned an
initial value. Both the scalar and the array may otherwise
be manipulated as normal. If one is unset, the other will
automatically be unset too. There is no way of untying the
variables without unsetting them, or converting the type of
one of them with another typeset command; +T does not work,
assign- ing an array to SCALAR is an error, and assigning a
scalar to array sets it to be a single-element array. Note
that both typeset -xT ... and export -T ... work, but only
the scalar will be marked for export. Setting the value
using the scalar version causes a split on all separators
(which cannot be quoted).</p>

<p>The -g (global) flag is treated specially: it means that
any resulting parameter will not be restricted to local
scope. Note that this does not necessarily mean that the
parameter will be global, as the flag will apply to any
existing parameter (even if unset) from an enclosing
function. This flag does not affect the parameter after
creation, hence it has no effect when list- ing existing
parameters, nor does the flag +g have any effect except in
combination with -m (see below).</p>

<p>If no name is present, the names and values of all
parameters are printed. In this case the attribute flags
restrict the dis- play to only those parameters that have
the specified attributes, and using + rather than - to
introduce the flag suppresses printing of the values of
parameters when there is no parameter name. Also, if the
last option is the word +, then names are printed but values
are not.</p>

<p>If the -m flag is given the name arguments are taken as
patterns (which should be quoted). With no attribute flags,
all parame- ters (or functions with the -f flag) with
matching names are printed (the shell option TYPESET_SILENT
is not used in this case). Note that -m is ignored if no
patterns are given. If the +g flag is combined with -m, a
new local parameter is cre- ated for every matching
parameter that is not already local. Otherwise -m applies
all other flags or assignments to the existing parameters.
Except when assignments are made with name=value, using +m
forces the matching parameters to be printed, even inside a
function.</p>

<p>If no attribute flags are given and either no -m flag is
present or the +m form was used, each parameter name printed
is preceded by a list of the attributes of that parameter
(array, associa- tion, exported, integer, readonly). If +m
is used with attribute flags, and all those flags are
introduced with +, the matching parameter names are printed
but their values are not.</p>

<p>Attribute flags that transform the final value (-L, -R,
-Z, -l, u) are only applied to the expanded value at the
point of a parameter expansion expression using $. They are
not applied when a parameter is retrieved internally by the
shell for any purpose.</p>

<p>The following attribute flags may be specified:</p>

<p>-A The names refer to associative array parameters; see
Array Parameters in zshparam(1).</p>

<p>-L Left justify and remove leading blanks from value. If
n is nonzero, it defines the width of the field. If n is
zero, the width is determined by the width of the value of
the first assignment. In the case of numeric parame- ters,
the length of the complete value assigned to the parameter
is used to determine the width, not the value that would be
output.</p>

<p>The width is the count of characters, which may be
multi- byte characters if the MULTIBYTE option is in effect.
Note that the screen width of the character is not taken
into account; if this is required, use padding with
parameter expansion flags ${(ml...)...} as described in
Parameter Expansion Flags in zshexpn(1).</p>

<p>When the parameter is expanded, it is filled on the
right with blanks or truncated if necessary to fit the
field. Note truncation can lead to unexpected results with
numeric parameters. Leading zeros are removed if the -Z flag
is also set.</p>

<p>-R Similar to -L, except that right justification is
used; when the parameter is expanded, the field is left
filled with blanks or truncated from the end. May not be
com- bined with the -Z flag.</p>

<p>-U For arrays (but not for associative arrays), keep
only the first occurrence of each duplicated value. This may
also be set for colon-separated special parameters like PATH
or FIGNORE, etc. This flag has a different meaning when used
with -f; see below.</p>

<p>-Z Specially handled if set along with the -L flag.
Other- wise, similar to -R, except that leading zeros are
used for padding instead of blanks if the first non-blank
character is a digit. Numeric parameters are specially
handled: they are always eligible for padding with zeroes,
and the zeroes are inserted at an appropriate place in the
output.</p>

<p>-a The names refer to array parameters. An array
parameter may be created this way, but it may not be
assigned to in the typeset statement. When displaying, both
normal and associative arrays are shown.</p>

<p>-f The names refer to functions rather than parameters.
No assignments can be made, and the only other valid flags
are -t, -k, -u, -U and -z. The flag -t turns on execu- tion
tracing for this function. The -u and -U flags cause the
function to be marked for autoloading; -U also causes alias
expansion to be suppressed when the function is loaded. The
fpath parameter will be searched to find the function
definition when the function is first refer- enced; see the
section Functions. The -k and -z flags make the function be
loaded using ksh-style or zsh-style autoloading
respectively. If neither is given, the set- ting of the
KSH_AUTOLOAD option determines how the func- tion is
loaded.</p>

<p>-h Hide: only useful for special parameters (those
marked &lt;S&gt; in the table in zshparam(1)), and for local
parame- ters with the same name as a special parameter,
though harmless for others. A special parameter with this
attribute will not retain its special effect when made
local. Thus after typeset -h PATH , a function contain- ing
typeset PATH will create an ordinary local parame- ter
without the usual behaviour of PATH. Alternatively, the
local parameter may itself be given this attribute; hence
inside a function typeset -h PATH creates an ordinary local
parameter and the special PATH parameter is not altered in
any way. It is also possible to create a local parameter
using typeset +h special , where the local copy of special
will retain its special properties regardless of having the
-h attribute. Global special parameters loaded from shell
modules (currently those in zsh/mapfile and zsh/parameter)
are automatically given the -h attribute to avoid name
clashes.</p>

<p>-H Hide value: specifies that typeset will not display
the value of the parameter when listing parameters; the dis-
play for such parameters is always as if the + flag had been
given. Use of the parameter is in other respects normal, and
the option does not apply if the parameter is specified by
name, or by pattern with the -m option. This is on by
default for the parameters in the zsh/parameter and
zsh/mapfile modules. Note, however, that unlike the -h flag
this is also useful for non-spe- cial parameters.</p>

<p>-i Use an internal integer representation. If n is
nonzero it defines the output arithmetic base, otherwise it
is determined by the first assignment. Bases from 2 to 36
inclusive are allowed.</p>

<p>-E Use an internal double-precision floating point
represen- tation. On output the variable will be converted
to sci- entific notation. If n is nonzero it defines the
number of significant figures to display; the default is
ten.</p>

<p>-F Use an internal double-precision floating point
represen- tation. On output the variable will be converted
to fixed-point decimal notation. If n is nonzero it defines
the number of digits to display after the decimal point; the
default is ten.</p>

<p>-l Convert the result to lower case whenever the
parameter is expanded. The value is not converted when
assigned.</p>

<p>-r The given names are marked readonly. Note that if
name is a special parameter, the readonly attribute can be
turned on, but cannot then be turned off.</p>

<p>-t Tags the named parameters. Tags have no special
meaning to the shell. This flag has a different meaning when
used with -f; see above.</p>

<p>-u Convert the result to upper case whenever the
parameter is expanded. The value is not converted when
assigned. This flag has a different meaning when used with
-f; see above.</p>

<p>-x Mark for automatic export to the environment of
subse- quently executed commands. If the option
GLOBAL_EXPORT is set, this implies the option -g, unless +g
is also explicitly given; in other words the parameter is
not made local to the enclosing function. This is for com-
patibility with previous versions of zsh.</p>

<p>ulimit [ [ -SHacdfilmnpqstvx | -N resource [ limit ] ...
] Set or display resource limits of the shell and the
processes started by the shell. The value of limit can be a
number in the unit specified below or the value unlimited .
By default, only soft limits are manipulated. If the -H flag
is given use hard limits instead of soft limits. If the -S
flag is given together with the -H flag set both hard and
soft limits. If no options are used, the file size limit
(-f) is assumed. If limit is omitted the current value of
the specified resources are printed. When more than one
resource values are printed the limit name and unit is
printed before each value.</p>

<p>When looping over multiple resources, the shell will
abort imme- diately if it detects a badly formed argument.
However, if it fails to set a limit for some other reason it
will continue try- ing to set the remaining limits.</p>

<p>-a Lists all of the current resource limits. -c 512-byte
blocks on the size of core dumps. -d K-bytes on the size of
the data segment. -f 512-byte blocks on the size of files
written. -i The number of pending signals. -l K-bytes on the
size of locked-in memory. -m K-bytes on the size of physical
memory. -n open file descriptors. -q Bytes in POSIX message
queues. -s K-bytes on the size of the stack. -t CPU seconds
to be used. -u processes available to the user. -v K-bytes
on the size of virtual memory. On some systems this refers
to the limit called address space. -x The number of locks on
files.</p>

<p>A resource may also be specified by integer in the form
-N resource, where resource corresponds to the integer
defined for the resource by the operating system. This may
be used to set the limits for resources known to the shell
which do not corre- spond to option letters. Such limits
will be shown by number in the output of ulimit -a.</p>

<p>The number may alternatively be out of the range of
limits com- piled into the shell. The shell will try to read
or write the limit anyway, and will report an error if this
fails.</p>

<p>umask [ -S ] [ mask ] The umask is set to mask. mask can
be either an octal number or a symbolic value as described
in chmod(1). If mask is omitted, the current value is
printed. The -S option causes the mask to be printed as a
symbolic value. Otherwise, the mask is printed as an octal
number. Note that in the symbolic form the permis- sions you
specify are those which are to be allowed (not denied) to
the users specified.</p>

<p>unalias Same as unhash -a.</p>

<p>unfunction Same as unhash -f.</p>

<p>unhash [ -adfms ] name ... Remove the element named name
from an internal hash table. The default is remove elements
from the command hash table. The -a option causes unhash to
remove regular or global aliases; note when removing a
global aliases that the argument must be quoted to prevent
it from being expanded before being passed to the command.
The -s option causes unhash to remove suffix aliases. The -f
option causes unhash to remove shell functions. The -d
options causes unhash to remove named directories. If the -m
flag is given the arguments are taken as patterns (should be
quoted) and all elements of the corresponding hash table
with matching names will be removed.</p>

<p>unlimit [ -hs ] resource ... The resource limit for each
resource is set to the hard limit. If the -h flag is given
and the shell has appropriate privi- leges, the hard
resource limit for each resource is removed. The resources
of the shell process are only changed if the -s flag is
given.</p>

<p>unset [ -fmv ] name ... Each named parameter is unset.
Local parameters remain local even if unset; they appear
unset within scope, but the previous value will still
reappear when the scope ends.</p>

<p>Individual elements of associative array parameters may
be unset by using subscript syntax on name, which should be
quoted (or the entire command prefixed with noglob) to
protect the sub- script from filename generation.</p>

<p>If the -m flag is specified the arguments are taken as
patterns (should be quoted) and all parameters with matching
names are unset. Note that this cannot be used when
unsetting associative array elements, as the subscript will
be treated as part of the pattern.</p>

<p>The -v flag specifies that name refers to parameters.
This is the default behaviour.</p>

<p>unset -f is equivalent to unfunction.</p>

<p>unsetopt [ {+|-}options | {+|-}o option_name ] [ name
... ] Unset the options for the shell. All options specified
either with flags or by name are unset. If no arguments are
supplied, the names of all options currently unset are
printed. If the -m flag is given the arguments are taken as
patterns (which should be quoted to preserve them from being
interpreted as glob pat- terns), and all options with names
matching these patterns are unset.</p>

<p>vared See the section Zle Builtins in zshzle(1).</p>

<p>wait [ job ... ] Wait for the specified jobs or
processes. If job is not given then all currently active
child processes are waited for. Each job can be either a job
specification or the process ID of a job in the job table.
The exit status from this command is that of the job waited
for.</p>

<p>whence [ -vcwfpams ] name ... For each name, indicate
how it would be interpreted if used as a command name.</p>

<p>-v Produce a more verbose report.</p>

<p>-c Print the results in a csh-like format. This takes
precedence over -v.</p>

<p>-w For each name, print name: word where word is one of
alias, builtin, command, function, hashed, reserved or none,
according as name corresponds to an alias, a built-in
command, an external command, a shell function, a command
defined with the hash builtin, a reserved word, or is not
recognised. This takes precedence over -v and -c.</p>

<p>-f Causes the contents of a shell function to be
displayed, which would otherwise not happen unless the -c
flag were used.</p>

<p>-p Do a path search for name even if it is an alias,
reserved word, shell function or builtin.</p>

<p>-a Do a search for all occurrences of name throughout
the command path. Normally only the first occurrence is
printed.</p>

<p>-m The arguments are taken as patterns (should be
quoted), and the information is displayed for each command
match- ing one of these patterns.</p>

<p>-s If a pathname contains symlinks, print the
symlink-free pathname as well.</p>

<p>where [ -wpms ] name ... Equivalent to whence -ca.</p>

<p>which [ -wpams ] name ... Equivalent to whence -c.</p>

<p>zcompile [ -U ] [ -z | -k ] [ -R | -M ] file [ name ...
] zcompile -ca [ -m ] [ -R | -M ] file [ name ... ] zcompile
-t file [ name ... ] This builtin command can be used to
compile functions or scripts, storing the compiled form in a
file, and to examine files containing the compiled form.
This allows faster autoloading of functions and execution of
scripts by avoiding parsing of the text when the files are
read.</p>

<p>The first form (without the -c, -a or -t options)
creates a com- piled file. If only the file argument is
given, the output file has the name file.zwc and will be
placed in the same directory as the file. The shell will
load the compiled file instead of the normal function file
when the function is autoloaded; see the section Autoloading
Functions in zshfunc(1) for a descrip- tion of how
autoloaded functions are searched. The extension .zwc stands
for zsh word code.</p>

<p>If there is at least one name argument, all the named
files are compiled into the output file given as the first
argument. If file does not end in .zwc, this extension is
automatically appended. Files containing multiple compiled
functions are called digest files, and are intended to be
used as elements of the FPATH/fpath special array.</p>

<p>The second form, with the -c or -a options, writes the
compiled definitions for all the named functions into file.
For -c, the names must be functions currently defined in the
shell, not those marked for autoloading. Undefined functions
that are marked for autoloading may be written by using the
-a option, in which case the fpath is searched and the
contents of the defini- tion files for those functions, if
found, are compiled into file. If both -c and -a are given,
names of both defined func- tions and functions marked for
autoloading may be given. In either case, the functions in
files written with the -c or -a option will be autoloaded as
if the KSH_AUTOLOAD option were unset.</p>

<p>The reason for handling loaded and not-yet-loaded
functions with different options is that some definition
files for autoloading define multiple functions, including
the function with the same name as the file, and, at the
end, call that function. In such cases the output of
zcompile -c does not include the addi- tional functions
defined in the file, and any other initializa- tion code in
the file is lost. Using zcompile -a captures all this extra
information.</p>

<p>If the -m option is combined with -c or -a, the names
are used as patterns and all functions whose names match one
of these patterns will be written. If no name is given, the
definitions of all functions currently defined or marked as
autoloaded will be written.</p>

<p>The third form, with the -t option, examines an existing
com- piled file. Without further arguments, the names of the
origi- nal files compiled into it are listed. The first line
of output shows the version of the shell which compiled the
file and how the file will be used (i.e. by reading it
directly or by mapping it into memory). With arguments,
nothing is output and the return status is set to zero if
definitions for all names were found in the compiled file,
and non-zero if the definition for at least one name was not
found.</p>

<p>Other options:</p>

<p>-U Aliases are not expanded when compiling the named
files.</p>

<p>-R When the compiled file is read, its contents are
copied into the shell s memory, rather than memory-mapped
(see -M). This happens automatically on systems that do not
support memory mapping.</p>

<p>When compiling scripts instead of autoloadable
functions, it is often desirable to use this option;
otherwise the whole file, including the code to define
functions which have already been defined, will remain
mapped, conse- quently wasting memory.</p>

<p>-M The compiled file is mapped into the shell s memory
when read. This is done in such a way that multiple
instances of the shell running on the same host will share
this mapped file. If neither -R nor -M is given, the
zcompile builtin decides what to do based on the size of the
com- piled file.</p>

<p>-k -z These options are used when the compiled file
contains functions which are to be autoloaded. If -z is
given, the function will be autoloaded as if the
KSH_AUTOLOAD option is not set, even if it is set at the
time the compiled file is read, while if the -k is given,
the function will be loaded as if KSH_AUTOLOAD is set. These
options also take precedence over any -k or -z options
specified to the autoload builtin. If neither of these
options is given, the function will be loaded as determined
by the setting of the KSH_AUTOLOAD option at the time the
com- piled file is read.</p>

<p>These options may also appear as many times as necessary
between the listed names to specify the loading style of all
following functions, up to the next -k or -z.</p>

<p>The created file always contains two versions of the
com- piled format, one for big-endian machines and one for
small-endian machines. The upshot of this is that the
compiled file is machine independent and if it is read or
mapped, only one half of the file is actually used (and
mapped).</p>

<p>zmodload [ -dL ] [ ... ] zmodload -F [ -lLme -P param ]
module [+-]feature... zmodload -e [ -A ] [ ... ] zmodload [
-a [ -bcpf [ -I ] ] ] [ -iL ] ... zmodload -u [ -abcdpf [ -I
] ] [ -iL ] ... zmodload -A [ -L ] [ modalias[=module] ... ]
zmodload -R modalias ... Performs operations relating to zsh
s loadable modules. Loading of modules while the shell is
running ( dynamical loading) is not available on all
operating systems, or on all installations on a particular
operating system, although the zmodload command itself is
always available and can be used to manipulate modules built
into versions of the shell executable without dynamical
loading.</p>

<p>Without arguments the names of all currently loaded
binary mod- ules are printed. The -L option causes this list
to be in the form of a series of zmodload commands. Forms
with arguments are:</p>

<p>zmodload [ -i ] name ... zmodload -u [ -i ] name ... In
the simplest case, zmodload loads a binary module. The
module must be in a file with a name consisting of the
specified name followed by a standard suffix, usually .so (
.sl on HPUX). If the module to be loaded is already loaded
the duplicate module is ignored. If zmod- load detects an
inconsistency, such as an invalid module name or circular
dependency list, the current code block is aborted. Hence
zmodload module 2&gt;/dev/null is suf- ficient to test
whether a module is available. If it is available, the
module is loaded if necessary, while if it is not available,
non-zero status is silently returned. The option -i is
accepted for compatibility but has no effect.</p>

<p>The named module is searched for in the same way a com-
mand is, using $module_path instead of $path. However, the
path search is performed even when the module name contains
a /, which it usually does. There is no way to prevent the
path search.</p>

<p>If the module supports features (see below), zmodload
tries to enable all features when loading a module. If the
module was successfully loaded but not all features could be
enabled, zmodload returns status 2.</p>

<p>With -u, zmodload unloads modules. The same name must be
given that was given when the module was loaded, but it is
not necessary for the module to exist in the filesys- tem.
The -i option suppresses the error if the module is already
unloaded (or was never loaded).</p>

<p>Each module has a boot and a cleanup function. The mod-
ule will not be loaded if its boot function fails. Simi-
larly a module can only be unloaded if its cleanup func-
tion runs successfully.</p>

<p>zmodload -F [ -almLe -P param ] module [+-]feature...
zmodload -F allows more selective control over the fea-
tures provided by modules. With no options apart from -F,
the module named module is loaded, if it was not already
loaded, and the list of features is set to the required
state. If no features are specified, the module is loaded,
if it was not already loaded, but the state of features is
unchanged. Each feature may be preceded by a + to turn the
feature on, or - to turn it off; the + is assumed if neither
character is present. Any feature not explicitly mentioned
is left in its current state; if the module was not
previously loaded this means any such fea- tures will remain
disabled. The return status is zero if all features were
set, 1 if the module failed to load, and 2 if some features
could not be set (for example, a parameter couldnt be added
because there was a different parameter of the same name)
but the module was loaded.</p>

<p>The standard features are builtins, conditions, parame-
ters and math functions; these are indicated by the pre- fix
b:, c: (C: for an infix condition), p: and f:, respectively,
followed by the name that the corre- sponding feature would
have in the shell. For example, b:strftime indicates a
builtin named strftime and p:EPOCHSECONDS indicates a
parameter named EPOCHSECONDS. The module may provide other
(abstract) features of its own as indicated by its
documentation; these have no pre- fix.</p>

<p>With -l or -L, features provided by the module are
listed. With -l alone, a list of features together with
their states is shown, one feature per line. With -L alone,
a zmodload -F command that would cause enabled features of
the module to be turned on is shown. With -lL, a zmodload -F
command that would cause all the fea- tures to be set to
their current state is shown. If one of these combinations
is given the option -P param then the parameter param is set
to an array of features, either features together with their
state or (if -L alone is given) enabled features.</p>

<p>With the option -L the module name may be omitted; then
a list of all enabled features for all modules providing
features is printed in the form of zmodload -F commands. If
-l is also given, the state of both enabled and dis- abled
features is output in that form.</p>

<p>A set of features may be provided together with -l or -L
and a module name; in that case only the state of those
features is considered. Each feature may be preceded by + or
- but the character has no effect. If no set of features is
provided, all features are considered.</p>

<p>With -e, the command first tests that the module is
loaded; if it is not, status 1 is returned. If the mod- ule
is loaded, the list of features given as an argument is
examined. Any feature given with no prefix is simply tested
to see if the module provides it; any feature given with a
prefix + or - is tested to see if is pro- vided and in the
given state. If the tests on all fea- tures in the list
succeed, status 0 is returned, else status 1.</p>

<p>With -m, each entry in the given list of features is
taken as a pattern to be matched against the list of fea-
tures provided by the module. An initial + or - must be
given explicitly. This may not be combined with the -a
option as autoloads must be specified explicitly.</p>

<p>With -a, the given list of features is marked for
autoload from the specified module, which may not yet be
loaded. An optional + may appear before the feature name. If
the feature is prefixed with -, any existing autoload is
removed. The options -l and -L may be used to list
autoloads. Autoloading is specific to individual features;
when the module is loaded only the requested feature is
enabled. Autoload requests are preserved if the module is
subsequently unloaded until an explicit zmodload -Fa module
-feature is issued. It is not an error to request an
autoload for a feature of a module that is already
loaded.</p>

<p>When the module is loaded each autoload is checked
against the features actually provided by the module; if the
feature is not provided the autoload request is deleted. A
warning message is output; if the module is being loaded to
provide a different feature, and that autoload is
successful, there is no effect on the status of the current
command. If the module is already loaded at the time when
zmodload -Fa is run, an error message is printed and status
1 returned.</p>

<p>zmodload -Fa can be used with the -l, -L, -e and -P
options for listing and testing the existence of
autoloadable features. In this case -l is ignored if -L is
specified. zmodload -FaL with no module name lists autoloads
for all modules.</p>

<p>Note that only standard features as described above can
be autoloaded; other features require the module to be
loaded before enabling.</p>

<p>zmodload -d [ -L ] [ name ] zmodload -d name dep ...
zmodload -ud name [ dep ... ] The -d option can be used to
specify module dependencies. The modules named in the second
and subsequent arguments will be loaded before the module
named in the first argu- ment.</p>

<p>With -d and one argument, all dependencies for that mod-
ule are listed. With -d and no arguments, all module
dependencies are listed. This listing is by default in a
Makefile-like format. The -L option changes this format to a
list of zmodload -d commands.</p>

<p>If -d and -u are both used, dependencies are removed. If
only one argument is given, all dependencies for that module
are removed.</p>

<p>zmodload -ab [ -L ] zmodload -ab [ -i ] name [ builtin
... ] zmodload -ub [ -i ] builtin ... The -ab option defines
autoloaded builtins. It defines the specified builtins. When
any of those builtins is called, the module specified in the
first argument is loaded and all its features are enabled
(for selective control of features use zmodload -F -a as
described above). If only the name is given, one builtin is
defined, with the same name as the module. -i suppresses the
error if the builtin is already defined or autoloaded, but
not if another builtin of the same name is already
defined.</p>

<p>With -ab and no arguments, all autoloaded builtins are
listed, with the module name (if different) shown in
parentheses after the builtin name. The -L option changes
this format to a list of zmodload -a commands.</p>

<p>If -b is used together with the -u option, it removes
builtins previously defined with -ab. This is only pos-
sible if the builtin is not yet loaded. -i suppresses the
error if the builtin is already removed (or never
existed).</p>

<p>Autoload requests are retained if the module is subse-
quently unloaded until an explicit zmodload -ub builtin is
issued.</p>

<p>zmodload -ac [ -IL ] zmodload -ac [ -iI ] name [ cond
... ] zmodload -uc [ -iI ] cond ... The -ac option is used
to define autoloaded condition codes. The cond strings give
the names of the conditions defined by the module. The
optional -I option is used to define infix condition names.
Without this option prefix condition names are defined.</p>

<p>If given no condition names, all defined names are
listed (as a series of zmodload commands if the -L option is
given).</p>

<p>The -uc option removes definitions for autoloaded condi-
tions.</p>

<p>zmodload -ap [ -L ] zmodload -ap [ -i ] name [ parameter
... ] zmodload -up [ -i ] parameter ... The -p option is
like the -b and -c options, but makes zmodload work on
autoloaded parameters instead.</p>

<p>zmodload -af [ -L ] zmodload -af [ -i ] name [ function
... ] zmodload -uf [ -i ] function ... The -f option is like
the -b, -p, and -c options, but makes zmodload work on
autoloaded math functions instead.</p>

<p>zmodload -a [ -L ] zmodload -a [ -i ] name [ builtin ...
] zmodload -ua [ -i ] builtin ... Equivalent to -ab and
-ub.</p>

<p>zmodload -e [ -A ] [ string ... ] The -e option without
arguments lists all loaded modules; if the -A option is also
given, module aliases corre- sponding to loaded modules are
also shown. If arguments are provided, nothing is printed;
the return status is set to zero if all strings given as
arguments are names of loaded modules and to one if at least
on string is not the name of a loaded module. This can be
used to test for the availability of things implemented by
modules. In this case, any aliases are automatically
resolved and the -A flag is not used.</p>

<p>zmodload -A [ -L ] [ modalias[=module] ... ] For each
argument, if both modalias and module are given, define
modalias to be an alias for the module module. If the module
modalias is ever subsequently requested, either via a call
to zmodload or implicitly, the shell will attempt to load
module instead. If module is not given, show the definition
of modalias. If no arguments are given, list all defined
module aliases. When list- ing, if the -L flag was also
given, list the definition as a zmodload command to recreate
the alias.</p>

<p>The existence of aliases for modules is completely inde-
pendent of whether the name resolved is actually loaded as a
module: while the alias exists, loading and unload- ing the
module under any alias has exactly the same effect as using
the resolved name, and does not affect the connection
between the alias and the resolved name which can be removed
either by zmodload -R or by redefin- ing the alias. Chains
of aliases (i.e. where the first resolved name is itself an
alias) are valid so long as these are not circular. As the
aliases take the same format as module names, they may
include path separators: in this case, there is no
requirement for any part of the path named to exist as the
alias will be resolved first. For example, any/old/alias is
always a valid alias.</p>

<p>Dependencies added to aliased modules are actually added
to the resolved module; these remain if the alias is
removed. It is valid to create an alias whose name is one of
the standard shell modules and which resolves to a different
module. However, if a module has dependencies, it will not
be possible to use the module name as an alias as the module
will already be marked as a loadable module in its own
right.</p>

<p>Apart from the above, aliases can be used in the
zmodload command anywhere module names are required.
However, aliases will not be shown in lists of loaded
modules with a bare zmodload.</p>

<p>zmodload -R modalias ... For each modalias argument that
was previously defined as a module alias via zmodload -A,
delete the alias. If any was not defined, an error is caused
and the remainder of the line is ignored.</p>

<p>Note that zsh makes no distinction between modules that
were linked into the shell and modules that are loaded
dynamically. In both cases this builtin command has to be
used to make avail- able the builtins and other things
defined by modules (unless the module is autoloaded on these
definitions). This is true even for systems that dont
support dynamic loading of modules.</p>

<p>NAME zshzle - zsh command line editor</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION If the ZLE option is set (which it is by
default in interactive shells) and the shell input is
attached to the terminal, the user is able to edit command
lines.</p>

<p>There are two display modes. The first, multiline mode,
is the default. It only works if the TERM parameter is set
to a valid termi- nal type that can move the cursor up. The
second, single line mode, is used if TERM is invalid or
incapable of moving the cursor up, or if the SINGLE_LINE_ZLE
option is set. This mode is similar to ksh, and uses no
termcap sequences. If TERM is &quot;emacs&quot;, the ZLE
option will be unset by default.</p>

<p>The parameters BAUD, COLUMNS, and LINES are also used by
the line edi- tor. See Parameters Used By The Shell in
zshparam(1).</p>

<p>The parameter zle_highlight is also used by the line
editor; see Char- acter Highlighting below. Highlighting of
special characters and the region between the cursor and the
mark (as set with set-mark-command in Emacs mode) is enabled
by default; consult this reference for more information.
Irascible conservatives will wish to know that all high-
lighting may be disabled by the following setting:</p>

<p>zle_highlight=(none)</p>

<p>KEYMAPS A keymap in ZLE contains a set of bindings
between key sequences and ZLE commands. The empty key
sequence cannot be bound.</p>

<p>There can be any number of keymaps at any time, and each
keymap has one or more names. If all of a keymaps names are
deleted, it disappears. bindkey can be used to manipulate
keymap names.</p>

<p>Initially, there are six keymaps:</p>

<p>emacs EMACS emulation viins vi emulation - insert mode
vicmd vi emulation - command mode isearch incremental search
mode command read a command name .safe fallback keymap</p>

<p>The .safe keymap is special. It can never be altered,
and the name can never be removed. However, it can be linked
to other names, which can be removed. In the future other
special keymaps may be added; users should avoid using names
beginning with . for their own keymaps.</p>

<p>In addition to these names, either emacs or viins is
also linked to the name main. If one of the VISUAL or EDITOR
environment variables contain the string vi when the shell
starts up then it will be viins, otherwise it will be emacs.
bindkeys -e and -v options provide a convenient way to
override this default choice.</p>

<p>When the editor starts up, it will select the main
keymap. If that keymap doesnt exist, it will use .safe
instead.</p>

<p>In the .safe keymap, each single key is bound to
self-insert, except for ^J (line feed) and ^M (return) which
are bound to accept-line. This is deliberately not pleasant
to use; if you are using it, it means you deleted the main
keymap, and you should put it back.</p>

<p>Reading Commands When ZLE is reading a command from the
terminal, it may read a sequence that is bound to some
command and is also a prefix of a longer bound string. In
this case ZLE will wait a certain time to see if more char-
acters are typed, and if not (or they dont match any longer
string) it will execute the binding. This timeout is defined
by the KEYTIMEOUT parameter; its default is 0.4 sec. There
is no timeout if the prefix string is not itself bound to a
command.</p>

<p>The key timeout is also applied when ZLE is reading the
bytes from a multibyte character string when it is in the
appropriate mode. (This requires that the shell was compiled
with multibyte mode enabled; typi- cally also the locale has
characters with the UTF-8 encoding, although any multibyte
encoding known to the operating system is supported.) If the
second or a subsequent byte is not read within the timeout
period, the shell acts as if ? were typed and resets the
input state.</p>

<p>As well as ZLE commands, key sequences can be bound to
other strings, by using bindkey -s. When such a sequence is
read, the replacement string is pushed back as input, and
the command reading process starts again using these fake
keystrokes. This input can itself invoke fur- ther
replacement strings, but in order to detect loops the
process will be stopped if there are twenty such
replacements without a real command being read.</p>

<p>A key sequence typed by the user can be turned into a
command name for use in user-defined widgets with the
read-command widget, described below.</p>

<p>ZLE BUILTINS The ZLE module contains three related
builtin commands. The bindkey command manipulates keymaps
and key bindings; the vared command invokes ZLE on the value
of a shell parameter; and the zle command manipulates
editing widgets and allows command line access to ZLE
commands from within shell functions.</p>

<p>bindkey [ options ] -l bindkey [ options ] -d bindkey [
options ] -D keymap ... bindkey [ options ] -A old-keymap
new-keymap bindkey [ options ] -N new-keymap [ old-keymap ]
bindkey [ options ] -m bindkey [ options ] -r in-string ...
bindkey [ options ] -s in-string out-string ... bindkey [
options ] in-string command ... bindkey [ options ] [
in-string ] bindkey s options can be divided into three
categories: keymap selection, operation selection, and
others. The keymap selec- tion options are:</p>

<p>-e Selects keymap emacs, and also links it to main.</p>

<p>-v Selects keymap viins, and also links it to main.</p>

<p>-a Selects keymap vicmd.</p>

<p>-M keymap The keymap specifies a keymap name.</p>

<p>If a keymap selection is required and none of the
options above are used, the main keymap is used. Some
operations do not permit a keymap to be selected,
namely:</p>

<p>-l List all existing keymap names. If the -L option is
also used, list in the form of bindkey commands to create
the keymaps.</p>

<p>-d Delete all existing keymaps and reset to the default
state.</p>

<p>-D keymap ... Delete the named keymaps.</p>

<p>-A old-keymap new-keymap Make the new-keymap name an
alias for old-keymap, so that both names refer to the same
keymap. The names have equal standing; if either is deleted,
the other remains. If there is already a keymap with the
new-keymap name, it is deleted.</p>

<p>-N new-keymap [ old-keymap ] Create a new keymap, named
new-keymap. If a keymap already has that name, it is
deleted. If an old-keymap name is given, the new keymap is
initialized to be a duplicate of it, otherwise the new
keymap will be empty.</p>

<p>To use a newly created keymap, it should be linked to
main. Hence the sequence of commands to create and use a new
keymap mymap initialized from the emacs keymap (which
remains unchanged) is:</p>

<p>bindkey -N mymap emacs bindkey -A mymap main</p>

<p>Note that while bindkey -A newmap main will work when
newmap is emacs or viins, it will not work for vicmd, as
switching from vi insert to command mode becomes
impossible.</p>

<p>The following operations act on the main keymap if no
keymap selection option was given:</p>

<p>-m Add the built-in set of meta-key bindings to the
selected keymap. Only keys that are unbound or bound to
self-insert are affected.</p>

<p>-r in-string ... Unbind the specified in-strings in the
selected keymap. This is exactly equivalent to binding the
strings to undefined-key.</p>

<p>When -R is also used, interpret the in-strings as
ranges.</p>

<p>When -p is also used, the in-strings specify prefixes.
Any binding that has the given in-string as a prefix, not
including the binding for the in-string itself, if any, will
be removed. For example,</p>

<p>bindkey -rpM viins^[</p>

<p>will remove all bindings in the vi-insert keymap begin-
ning with an escape character (probably cursor keys), but
leave the binding for the escape character itself (proba-
bly vi-cmd-mode). This is incompatible with the option
-R.</p>

<p>-s in-string out-string ... Bind each in-string to each
out-string. When in-string is typed, out-string will be
pushed back and treated as input to the line editor. When -R
is also used, inter- pret the in-strings as ranges.</p>

<p>in-string command ... Bind each in-string to each
command. When -R is used, interpret the in-strings as
ranges.</p>

<p>[ in-string ] List key bindings. If an in-string is
specified, the binding of that string in the selected keymap
is dis- played. Otherwise, all key bindings in the selected
keymap are displayed. (As a special case, if the -e or -v
option is used alone, the keymap is not displayed - the
implicit linking of keymaps is the only thing that
happens.)</p>

<p>When the option -p is used, the in-string must be
present. The listing shows all bindings which have the given
key sequence as a prefix, not including any bind- ings for
the key sequence itself.</p>

<p>When the -L option is used, the list is in the form of
bindkey commands to create the key bindings.</p>

<p>When the -R option is used as noted above, a valid range
consists of two characters, with an optional - between them.
All characters between the two specified, inclusive, are
bound as specified.</p>

<p>For either in-string or out-string, the following escape
sequences are recognised:</p>

<p>a bell character b b a c k s p a c e eE escape f form
feed n linefeed (newline)r carriage return t horizontal tab
vertical tab NNN character code in octal NN character code
in hexadecimal M[-]X character with meta bit set -]X control
character ^X control character</p>

<p>In all other cases, escapes the following character.
Delete is written as ^?. Note thatM^? and M? are not the
same, and that (unlike emacs), the bindingsM-X andeX are
entirely dis- tinct, although they are initialized to the
same bindings by bindkey -m.</p>

<p>vared [ -Aache ] [ -p prompt ] [ -r rprompt ] [ -M
main-keymap ] [ -m vicmd-keymap ] [ -t tty ] name The value
of the parameter name is loaded into the edit buffer, and
the line editor is invoked. When the editor exits, name is
set to the string value returned by the editor. When the -c
flag is given, the parameter is created if it doesnt already
exist. The -a flag may be given with -c to create an array
parameter, or the -A flag to create an associative array. If
the type of an existing parameter does not match the type to
be created, the parameter is unset and recreated.</p>

<p>If an array or array slice is being edited, separator
characters as defined in $IFS will be shown quoted with a
backslash, as will backslashes themselves. Conversely, when
the edited text is split into an array, a backslash quotes
an immediately fol- lowing separator character or backslash;
no other special han- dling of backslashes, or any handling
of quotes, is performed.</p>

<p>Individual elements of existing array or associative
array parameters may be edited by using subscript syntax on
name. New elements are created automatically, even without
-c.</p>

<p>If the -p flag is given, the following string will be
taken as the prompt to display at the left. If the -r flag
is given, the following string gives the prompt to display
at the right. If the -h flag is specified, the history can
be accessed from ZLE. If the -e flag is given, typing ^D
(Control-D) on an empty line causes vared to exit
immediately with a non-zero return value.</p>

<p>The -M option gives a keymap to link to the main keymap
during editing, and the -m option gives a keymap to link to
the vicmd keymap during editing. For vi-style editing, this
allows a pair of keymaps to override viins and vicmd. For
emacs-style edit- ing, only -M is normally needed but the -m
option may still be used. On exit, the previous keymaps will
be restored.</p>

<p>If -t tty is given, tty is the name of a terminal device
to be used instead of the default /dev/tty. If tty does not
refer to a terminal an error is reported.</p>

<p>zle zle -l [ -L | -a ] [ string ... ] zle -D widget ...
zle -A old-widget new-widget zle -N widget [ function ] zle
-C widget completion-widget function zle -R [ -c ] [
display-string ] [ string ... ] zle -M string zle -U string
zle -K keymap zle -F [ -L ] [ fd [ handler ] ] zle -I zle
widget [ -n num ] [ -Nw ] [ -K keymap ] args ... The zle
builtin performs a number of different actions concern- ing
ZLE.</p>

<p>With no options and no arguments, only the return status
will be set. It is zero if ZLE is currently active and
widgets could be invoked using this builtin command and
non-zero otherwise. Note that even if non-zero status is
returned, zle may still be active as part of the completion
system; this does not allow direct calls to ZLE widgets.</p>

<p>Otherwise, which operation it performs depends on its
options:</p>

<p>-l [ -L | -a ] List all existing user-defined widgets.
If the -L option is used, list in the form of zle commands
to create the widgets.</p>

<p>When combined with the -a option, all widget names are
listed, including the builtin ones. In this case the -L
option is ignored.</p>

<p>If at least one string is given, nothing will be printed
but the return status will be zero if all strings are names
of existing widgets (or of user-defined widgets if the -a
flag is not given) and non-zero if at least one string is
not a name of an defined widget.</p>

<p>-D widget ... Delete the named widgets.</p>

<p>-A old-widget new-widget Make the new-widget name an
alias for old-widget, so that both names refer to the same
widget. The names have equal standing; if either is deleted,
the other remains. If there is already a widget with the
new-widget name, it is deleted.</p>

<p>-N widget [ function ] Create a user-defined widget. If
there is already a wid- get with the specified name, it is
overwritten. When the new widget is invoked from within the
editor, the speci- fied shell function is called. If no
function name is specified, it defaults to the same name as
the widget. For further information, see the section Widgets
in zsh- zle(1).</p>

<p>-C widget completion-widget function Create a
user-defined completion widget named widget. The completion
widget will behave like the built-in comple- tion-widget
whose name is given as completion-widget. To generate the
completions, the shell function function will be called. For
further information, see zshcomp- wid(1).</p>

<p>-R [ -c ] [ display-string ] [ string ... ] Redisplay
the command line; this is to be called from within a
user-defined widget to allow changes to become visible. If a
display-string is given and not empty, this is shown in the
status line (immediately below the line being edited).</p>

<p>If the optional strings are given they are listed below
the prompt in the same way as completion lists are printed.
If no strings are given but the -c option is used such a
list is cleared.</p>

<p>Note that this option is only useful for widgets that do
not exit immediately after using it because the strings
displayed will be erased immediately after return from the
widget.</p>

<p>This command can safely be called outside user defined
widgets; if zle is active, the display will be refreshed,
while if zle is not active, the command has no effect. In
this case there will usually be no other arguments.</p>

<p>The status is zero if zle was active, else one.</p>

<p>-M string As with the -R option, the string will be
displayed below the command line; unlike the -R option, the
string will not be put into the status line but will instead
be printed normally below the prompt. This means that the
string will still be displayed after the widget returns
(until it is overwritten by subsequent commands).</p>

<p>-U string This pushes the characters in the string onto
the input stack of ZLE. After the widget currently executed
fin- ishes ZLE will behave as if the characters in the
string were typed by the user.</p>

<p>As ZLE uses a stack, if this option is used repeatedly
the last string pushed onto the stack will be processed
first. However, the characters in each string will be
processed in the order in which they appear in the
string.</p>

<p>-K keymap Selects the keymap named keymap. An error
message will be displayed if there is no such keymap.</p>

<p>This keymap selection affects the interpretation of fol-
lowing keystrokes within this invocation of ZLE. Any
following invocation (e.g., the next command line) will
start as usual with the main keymap selected.</p>

<p>-F [ -L ] [ fd [ handler ] ] Only available if your
system supports one of the poll or select system calls; most
modern systems do.</p>

<p>Installs handler (the name of a shell function) to
handle input from file descriptor fd. When zle is attempting
to read data, it will examine both the terminal and the list
of handled fds. If data becomes available on a handled fd,
zle will call handler with the fd which is ready for reading
as the only argument. If the handler produces output to the
terminal, it should call zle -I before doing so (see below).
The handler should not attempt to read from the terminal.
Note that zle makes no attempt to check whether this fd is
actually readable when installing the handler. The user must
make their own arrangements for handling the file descriptor
when zle is not active.</p>

<p>Any number of handlers for any number of readable file
descriptors may be installed. Installing a handler for an fd
which is already handled causes the existing han- dler to be
replaced.</p>

<p>If no handler is given, but an fd is present, any
handler for that fd is removed. If there is none, an error
mes- sage is printed and status 1 is returned.</p>

<p>If no arguments are given, or the -L option is supplied,
a list of handlers is printed in a form which can be stored
for later execution.</p>

<p>An fd (but not a handler) may optionally be given with
the -L option; in this case, the function will list the
handler if any, else silently return status 1.</p>

<p>Note that this feature should be used with care. Activ-
ity on one of the fds which is not properly handled can
cause the terminal to become unusable.</p>

<p>Here is a simple example of using this feature. A con-
nection to a remote TCP port is created using the ztcp
command; see the description of the zsh/net/tcp module in
zshmodules(1). Then a handler is installed which simply
prints out any data which arrives on this connection. Note
that select will indicate that the file descriptor needs
handling if the remote side has closed the connec- tion; we
handle that by testing for a failed read. if ztcp pwspc
2811; then tcpfd=$REPLY handler() { zle -I local line if !
read -r line &lt;&amp;$1; then # select marks this fd if we
reach EOF, # so handle this specially. print &quot;[Read on
fd $1 failed, removing.]&quot; &gt;&amp;2 zle -F $1 return 1
fi print -r - $line } zle -F $tcpfd handler fi</p>

<p>-I Unusually, this option is most useful outside
ordinary widget functions, though it may be used within if
normal output to the terminal is required. It invalidates
the current zle display in preparation for output; typically
this will be from a trap function. It has no effect if zle
is not active. When a trap exits, the shell checks to see if
the display needs restoring, hence the follow- ing will
print output in such a way as not to disturb the line being
edited:</p>

<p>TRAPUSR1() { # Invalidate zle display [[ -o zle ]]
&amp;&amp; zle -I # Show output print Hello }</p>

<p>In general, the trap function may need to test whether
zle is active before using this method (as shown in the
example), since the zsh/zle module may not even be loaded;
if it is not, the command can be skipped.</p>

<p>It is possible to call zle -I several times before con-
trol is returned to the editor; the display will only be
invalidated the first time to minimise disruption.</p>

<p>Note that there are normally better ways of manipulating
the display from within zle widgets; see, for example, zle
-R above.</p>

<p>The returned status is zero if zle was invalidated, even
though this may have been by a previous call to zle -I or by
a system notification. To test if a zle widget may be called
at this point, execute zle with no arguments and examine the
return status.</p>

<p>widget [ -n num ] [ -Nw ] [ -K keymap ] args ... Invoke
the specified widget. This can only be done when ZLE is
active; normally this will be within a user-defined
widget.</p>

<p>With the options -n and -N, the current numerical argu-
ment will be saved and then restored after the call to
widget; -n num sets the numerical argument temporarily to
num, while -N sets it to the default, i.e. as if there were
none.</p>

<p>With the option -K, keymap will be used as the current
keymap during the execution of the widget. The previous
keymap will be restored when the widget exits.</p>

<p>Normally, calling a widget in this way does not set the
special parameter WIDGET and related parameters, so that the
environment appears as if the top-level widget called by the
user were still active. With the option -w, WID- GET and
related parameters are set to reflect the widget being
executed by the zle call.</p>

<p>Any further arguments will be passed to the widget; note
that as standard argument handling is performed, any gen-
eral argument list should be preceded by --. If it is a
shell function, these are passed down as positional
parameters; for builtin widgets it is up to the widget in
question what it does with them. Currently arguments are
only handled by the incremental-search commands, the his-
tory-search-forward and -backward and the corresponding
functions prefixed by vi-, and by universal-argument. No
error is flagged if the command does not use the argu-
ments, or only uses some of them.</p>

<p>The return status reflects the success or failure of the
operation carried out by the widget, or if it is a
user-defined widget the return status of the shell func-
tion.</p>

<p>A non-zero return status causes the shell to beep when
the widget exits, unless the BEEP options was unset or the
widget was called via the zle command. Thus if a user
defined widget requires an immediate beep, it should call
the beep widget directly.</p>

<p>WIDGETS All actions in the editor are performed by
widgets . A widgets job is simply to perform some small
action. The ZLE commands that key sequences in keymaps are
bound to are in fact widgets. Widgets can be user-defined or
built in.</p>

<p>The standard widgets built in to ZLE are listed in
Standard Widgets below. Other built-in widgets can be
defined by other modules (see zshmodules(1)). Each built-in
widget has two names: its normal canoni- cal name, and the
same name preceded by a . . The . name is spe- cial: it can
t be rebound to a different widget. This makes the widget
available even when its usual name has been redefined.</p>

<p>User-defined widgets are defined using zle -N , and
implemented as shell functions. When the widget is executed,
the corresponding shell function is executed, and can
perform editing (or other) actions. It is recommended that
user-defined widgets should not have names starting with
..</p>

<p>USER-DEFINED WIDGETS User-defined widgets, being
implemented as shell functions, can execute any normal shell
command. They can also run other widgets (whether built-in
or user-defined) using the zle builtin command. The standard
input of the function is closed to prevent external commands
from unin- tentionally blocking ZLE by reading from the
terminal, but read -k or read -q can be used to read
characters. Finally, they can examine and edit the ZLE
buffer being edited by reading and setting the special
parameters described below.</p>

<p>These special parameters are always available in widget
functions, but are not in any way special outside ZLE. If
they have some normal value outside ZLE, that value is
temporarily inaccessible, but will return when the widget
function exits. These special parameters in fact have local
scope, like parameters created in a function using
local.</p>

<p>Inside completion widgets and traps called while ZLE is
active, these parameters are available read-only.</p>

<p>BUFFER (scalar) The entire contents of the edit buffer.
If it is written to, the cursor remains at the same offset,
unless that would put it outside the buffer.</p>

<p>BUFFERLINES (integer) The number of screen lines needed
for the edit buffer currently displayed on screen (i.e.
without any changes to the preceding parameters done after
the last redisplay); read-only.</p>

<p>CONTEXT (scalar) The context in which zle was called to
read a line; read-only. One of the values: start The start
of a command line (at prompt PS1).</p>

<p>cont A continuation to a command line (at prompt
PS2).</p>

<p>select In a select loop.</p>

<p>vared Editing a variable in vared.</p>

<p>CURSOR (integer) The offset of the cursor, within the
edit buffer. This is in the range 0 to $#BUFFER, and is by
definition equal to $#LBUFFER. Attempts to move the cursor
outside the buffer will result in the cursor being moved to
the appropriate end of the buffer.</p>

<p>CUTBUFFER (scalar) The last item to be cut using one of
the kill- commands; the string which the next yank would
insert in the line. Later entries in the kill ring are in
the array killring. Note that the command zle
copy-region-as-kill string can be used to set the text of
the cut buffer from a shell function and cycle the kill ring
in the same way as interactively killing text.</p>

<p>HISTNO (integer) The current history number. Setting
this has the same effect as moving up or down in the history
to the corresponding history line. An attempt to set it is
ignored if the line is not stored in the history. Note this
is not the same as the parameter HISTCMD, which always gives
the number of the history line being added to the main
shells history. HISTNO refers to the line being retrieved
within zle.</p>

<p>KEYMAP (scalar) The name of the currently selected
keymap; read-only.</p>

<p>KEYS (scalar) The keys typed to invoke this widget, as a
literal string; read-only.</p>

<p>killring (array) The array of previously killed items,
with the most recently killed first. This gives the items
that would be retrieved by a yank-pop in the same order.
Note, however, that the most recently killed item is in
$CUTBUFFER; $killring shows the array of previous
entries.</p>

<p>The default size for the kill ring is eight, however the
length may be changed by normal array operations. Any empty
string in the kill ring is ignored by the yank-pop command,
hence the size of the array effectively sets the maximum
length of the kill ring, while the number of non-zero
strings gives the current length, both as seen by the user
at the command line.</p>

<p>LASTABORTEDSEARCH (scalar) The last search string used
by an interactive search that was aborted by the user
(status 3 returned by the search widget).</p>

<p>LASTSEARCH (scalar) The last search string used by an
interactive search; read-only. This is set even if the
search failed (status 0, 1 or 2 returned by the search
widget), but not if it was aborted by the user.</p>

<p>LASTWIDGET (scalar) The name of the last widget that was
executed; read-only.</p>

<p>LBUFFER (scalar) The part of the buffer that lies to the
left of the cursor posi- tion. If it is assigned to, only
that part of the buffer is replaced, and the cursor remains
between the new $LBUFFER and the old $RBUFFER.</p>

<p>MARK (integer) Like CURSOR, but for the mark.</p>

<p>NUMERIC (integer) The numeric argument. If no numeric
argument was given, this parameter is unset. When this is
set inside a widget function, builtin widgets called with
the zle builtin command will use the value assigned. If it
is unset inside a widget function, builtin widgets called
behave as if no numeric argument was given.</p>

<p>PENDING (integer) The number of bytes pending for input,
i.e. the number of bytes which have already been typed and
can immediately be read. On systems where the shell is not
able to get this information, this parameter will always
have a value of zero. Read-only.</p>

<p>PREBUFFER (scalar) In a multi-line input at the
secondary prompt, this read-only parameter contains the
contents of the lines before the one the cursor is currently
in.</p>

<p>PREDISPLAY (scalar) Text to be displayed before the
start of the editable text buffer. This does not have to be
a complete line; to display a complete line, a newline must
be appended explicitly. The text is reset on each new
invocation (but not recursive invoca- tion) of zle.</p>

<p>POSTDISPLAY (scalar) Text to be displayed after the end
of the editable text buffer. This does not have to be a
complete line; to display a complete line, a newline must be
prepended explicitly. The text is reset on each new
invocation (but not recursive invocation) of zle.</p>

<p>RBUFFER (scalar) The part of the buffer that lies to the
right of the cursor position. If it is assigned to, only
that part of the buffer is replaced, and the cursor remains
between the old $LBUFFER and the new $RBUFFER.</p>

<p>REGION_ACTIVE (integer) Indicates if the region is
currently active. It can be assigned 0 or 1 to deactivate
and activate the region respectively; see Character
Highlighting below.</p>

<p>region_highlight (array) Each element of this array may
be set to a string that describes highlighting for an
arbitrary region of the command line that will take effect
the next time the command line is redisplayed. Highlighting
of the non-editable parts of the command line in PREDISPLAY
and POSTDISPLAY are possible, but note that the P flag is
needed for character indexing to include PREDISPLAY.</p>

<p>Each string consists of the following parts:</p>

<p>Optionally, a P to signify that the start and end offset
that follow include any string set by the PREDISPLAY special
parameter; this is needed if the predisplay string itself is
to be highlighted. Whitespace may follow the P. A start
offset in the same units as CURSOR, terminated by
whitespace. An end offset in the same units as CURSOR,
terminated by whitespace. A highlight specification in the
same format as used for contexts in the parameter
zle_highlight, see Character Highlighting below; for
example, standout or fg=red,bold.</p>

<p>For example,</p>

<p>region_highlight=(&quot;P0 20 bold&quot;)</p>

<p>specifies that the first twenty characters of the text
including any predisplay string should be highlighted in
bold.</p>

<p>Note that the effect of region_highlight is not saved
and disap- pears as soon as the line is accepted. The line
editor makes no attempt to keep the highlighting effect
synchronised with the line as it is edited; hence region
highlighting is best limited to static effects within user
widgets.</p>

<p>WIDGET (scalar) The name of the widget currently being
executed; read-only.</p>

<p>WIDGETFUNC (scalar) The name of the shell function that
implements a widget defined with either zle -N or zle -C. In
the former case, this is the second argument to the zle -N
command that defined the widget, or the first argument if
there was no second argument. In the latter case this is the
the third argument to the zle -C command that defined the
widget. Read-only.</p>

<p>WIDGETSTYLE (scalar) Describes the implementation behind
the completion widget cur- rently being executed; the second
argument that followed zle -C when the widget was defined.
This is the name of a builtin com- pletion widget. For
widgets defined with zle -N this is set to the empty string.
Read-only.</p>

<p>Special Widgets There are a few user-defined widgets
which are special to the shell. If they do not exist, no
special action is taken. The environment pro- vided is
identical to that for any other editing widget.</p>

<p>zle-line-init Executed every time the line editor is
started to read a new line of input. The following example
puts the line editor into vi command mode when it starts
up.</p>

<p>zle-line-init() { zle -K vicmd; } zle -N
zle-line-init</p>

<p>(The command inside the function sets the keymap
directly; it is equivalent to zle vi-cmd-mode.)</p>

<p>zle-line-finish This is similar to zle-line-init but is
executed every time the line editor has finished reading a
line of input.</p>

<p>zle-keymap-select Executed every time the keymap
changes, i.e. the special parame- ter KEYMAP is set to a
different value, while the line editor is active.
Initialising the keymap when the line editor starts does not
cause the widget to be called.</p>

<p>The value $KEYMAP within the function reflects the new
keymap. The old keymap is passed as the sole argument.</p>

<p>This can been used for detecting switches between the vi
command (vicmd) and insert (usually main) keymaps.</p>

<p>STANDARD WIDGETS The following is a list of all the
standard widgets, and their default bindings in emacs mode,
vi command mode and vi insert mode (the emacs, vicmd and
viins keymaps, respectively).</p>

<p>Note that cursor keys are bound to movement keys in all
three keymaps; the shell assumes that the cursor keys send
the key sequences reported by the terminal-handling library
(termcap or terminfo). The key sequences shown in the list
are those based on the VT100, common on many modern
terminals, but in fact these are not necessarily bound. In
the case of the viins keymap, the initial escape character
of the sequences serves also to return to the vicmd keymap:
whether this hap- pens is determined by the KEYTIMEOUT
parameter, see zshparam(1).</p>

forward one word, where a word is defined as a series of
non-blank characters.</p>

<p>vi-forward-blank-word-end (unbound) (E) (unbound) Move

move to the next event in the history list. Then move to the
first non-blank character on the line.</p>

<p>down-line-or-search Move down a line in the buffer, or
if already at the bottom line, search forward in the history
for a line beginning with the first word in the buffer.</p>

<p>If called from a function by the zle command with
arguments, the first argument is taken as the string for
which to search, rather than the first word in the
buffer.</p>

<p>down-history (unbound) (^N) (unbound) Move to the next

<p>end-of-history Move to the last event in the history
list.</p>

<p>vi-fetch-history (unbound) (G) (unbound) Fetch the
history line specified by the numeric argument. This
defaults to the current history line (i.e. the one that isnt
history yet).</p>

<p>history-incremental-search-backward (^R ^Xr) (unbound)
(unbound) Search backward incrementally for a specified
string. The search is case-insensitive if the search string
does not have uppercase letters and no numeric argument was
given. The string may begin with ^ to anchor the search to
the beginning of the line. When called from a user-defined
function returns the fol- lowing statuses: 0, if the search
succeeded; 1, if the search failed; 2, if the search term
was a bad pattern; 3, if the search was aborted by the
send-break command.</p>

<p>A restricted set of editing functions is available in
the mini-buffer. Keys are looked up in the special isearch
keymap, and if not found there in the main keymap (note that
by default the isearch keymap is empty). An interrupt
signal, as defined by the stty setting, will stop the search
and go back to the original line. An undefined key will have
the same effect. Note that the following always perform the
same task within incremental searches and cannot be replaced
by user defined wid- gets. The supported functions are:</p>

<p>accept-and-hold accept-and-infer-next-history
accept-line accept-line-and-down-history Perform the usual
function after exiting incremental search. The command line
displayed is executed.</p>

<p>backward-delete-char vi-backward-delete-char Back up one
place in the search history. If the search has been repeated
this does not immediately erase a char- acter in the
minibuffer.</p>

<p>accept-search Exit incremental search, retaining the
command line but performing no further action. Note that
this function is not bound by default and has no effect
outside incremen- tal search.</p>

<p>backward-delete-word backward-kill-word
vi-backward-kill-word Back up one character in the
minibuffer; if multiple searches have been performed since
the character was inserted the search history is rewound to
the point just before the character was entered. Hence this
has the effect of repeating backward-delete-char.</p>

<p>clear-screen Clear the screen, remaining in incremental
search mode.</p>

<p>history-incremental-search-backward Find the next
occurrence of the contents of the mini-buffer.</p>

<p>history-incremental-search-forward Invert the sense of
the search.</p>

<p>magic-space Inserts a non-magical space.</p>

<p>quoted-insert vi-quoted-insert Quote the character to
insert into the minibuffer.</p>

<p>redisplay Redisplay the command line, remaining in
incremental search mode.</p>

<p>vi-cmd-mode Toggle between the main and vicmd keymaps;
the main keymap (insert mode) will be selected
initially.</p>

<p>vi-repeat-search vi-rev-repeat-search Repeat the search.
The direction of the search is indi- cated in the
mini-buffer.</p>

<p>Any multi-character string that is not bound to one of
the above functions will beep and interrupt the search,
leaving the last found line in the buffer. Any single
character that is not bound to one of the above functions,
or self-insert or self-insert-unmeta, will have the same
effect but the function will be executed.</p>

<p>When called from a widget function by the zle command,
the incremental search commands can take a string argument.
This will be treated as a string of keys, as for arguments
to the bindkey command, and used as initial input for the
command. Any characters in the string which are unused by
the incremental search will be silently ignored. For
example,</p>

<p>zle history-incremental-search-backward forceps</p>

<p>will search backwards for forceps, leaving the
minibuffer con- taining the string forceps.</p>

<p>history-incremental-search-forward (^S ^Xs) (unbound)
(unbound) Search forward incrementally for a specified
string. The search is case-insensitive if the search string
does not have uppercase letters and no numeric argument was
given. The string may begin with ^ to anchor the search to
the beginning of the line. The functions available in the
mini-buffer are the same as for his-
tory-incremental-search-backward.</p>

<p>history-incremental-pattern-search-backward
history-incremental-pattern-search-forward These widgets
behave similarly to the corresponding widgets with no
-pattern, but the search string typed by the user is treated
as a pattern, respecting the current settings of the various
options affecting pattern matching. See FILENAME GENERATION
in zshexpn(1) for a description of patterns. If no numeric
argu- ment was given lowercase letters in the search string
may match uppercase letters in the history. The string may
begin with ^ to anchor the search to the beginning of the
line.</p>

<p>The prompt changes to indicate an invalid pattern; this
may sim- ply indicate the pattern is not yet complete.</p>

<p>Note that only non-overlapping matches are reported, so
an expression with wildcards may return fewer matches on a
line than are visible by inspection.</p>

<p>history-search-backward (ESC-P ESC-p) (unbound)
(unbound) Search backward in the history for a line
beginning with the first word in the buffer.</p>

<p>If called from a function by the zle command with
arguments, the first argument is taken as the string for
which to search, rather than the first word in the
buffer.</p>

<p>vi-history-search-backward (unbound) (/) (unbound)
Search backward in the history for a specified string. The
string may begin with ^ to anchor the search to the
beginning of the line.</p>

<p>A restricted set of editing functions is available in
the mini-buffer. An interrupt signal, as defined by the stty
set- ting, will stop the search. The functions available in
the mini-buffer are: accept-line, backward-delete-char,
vi-back- ward-delete-char, backward-kill-word,
vi-backward-kill-word, clear-screen, redisplay,
quoted-insert and vi-quoted-insert.</p>

<p>vi-cmd-mode is treated the same as accept-line, and
magic-space is treated as a space. Any other character that
is not bound to self-insert or self-insert-unmeta will beep
and be ignored. If the function is called from vi command
mode, the bindings of the current insert mode will be
used.</p>

<p>If called from a function by the zle command with
arguments, the first argument is taken as the string for
which to search, rather than the first word in the
buffer.</p>

<p>history-search-forward (ESC-N ESC-n) (unbound) (unbound)
Search forward in the history for a line beginning with the
first word in the buffer.</p>

<p>If called from a function by the zle command with
arguments, the first argument is taken as the string for
which to search, rather than the first word in the
buffer.</p>

<p>vi-history-search-forward (unbound) (?) (unbound) Search
forward in the history for a specified string. The string
may begin with ^ to anchor the search to the beginning of
the line. The functions available in the mini-buffer are the
same as for vi-history-search-backward. Argument handling is
also the same as for that command.</p>

<p>infer-next-history (^X^N) (unbound) (unbound) Search in
the history list for a line matching the current one and
fetch the event following it.</p>

<p>insert-last-word (ESC-_ ESC-.) (unbound) (unbound)
Insert the last word from the previous history event at the
cur- sor position. If a positive numeric argument is given,
insert that word from the end of the previous history event.
If the argument is zero or negative insert that word from
the left (zero inserts the previous command word). Repeating
this com- mand replaces the word just inserted with the last
word from the history event prior to the one just used;
numeric arguments can be used in the same way to pick a word
from that event.</p>

<p>When called from a shell function invoked from a
user-defined widget, the command can take one to three
arguments. The first argument specifies a history offset
which applies to successive calls to this widget: if is -1,
the default behaviour is used, while if it is 1, successive
calls will move forwards through the history. The value 0
can be used to indicate that the his- tory line examined by
the previous execution of the command will be reexamined.
Note that negative numbers should be preceded with a --
argument to avoid confusing them with options.</p>

<p>If two arguments are given, the second specifies the
word on the command line in normal array index notation (as
a more natural alternative to the prefix argument). Hence 1
is the first word, and -1 (the default) is the last
word.</p>

<p>If a third argument is given, its value is ignored, but
it is used to signify that the history offset is relative to
the cur- rent history line, rather than the one remembered
after the pre- vious invocations of insert-last-word.</p>

<p>For example, the default behaviour of the command
corresponds to</p>

<p>zle insert-last-word -- -1 -1</p>

<p>while the command</p>

<p>zle insert-last-word -- -1 1 -</p>

<p>always copies the first word of the line in the history
immedi- ately before the line being edited. This has the
side effect that later invocations of the widget will be
relative to that line.</p>

<p>vi-repeat-search (unbound) (n) (unbound) Repeat the last
vi history search.</p>

<p>vi-rev-repeat-search (unbound) (N) (unbound) Repeat the
last vi history search, but in reverse.</p>

<p>up-line-or-history (^P ESC-[A) (k) (ESC-[A) Move up a
line in the buffer, or if already at the top line, move to
the previous event in the history list.</p>

<p>vi-up-line-or-history (unbound) (-) (unbound) Move up a
line in the buffer, or if already at the top line, move to
the previous event in the history list. Then move to the
first non-blank character on the line.</p>

<p>up-line-or-search Move up a line in the buffer, or if
already at the top line, search backward in the history for
a line beginning with the first word in the buffer.</p>

<p>If called from a function by the zle command with
arguments, the first argument is taken as the string for
which to search, rather than the first word in the
buffer.</p>

<p>up-history (unbound) (^P) (unbound) Move to the previous
event in the history list.</p>

<p>history-beginning-search-forward Search forward in the
history for a line beginning with the cur- rent line up to
the cursor. This leaves the cursor in its orig- inal
position.</p>

to the end of the line and enter insert mode.</p>

<p>vi-add-next (unbound) (a) (unbound) Enter insert mode

the command is vi-change, change the current line.</p>

<p>vi-change-eol (unbound) (C) (unbound) Kill to the end of
the line and enter insert mode.</p>

<p>vi-change-whole-line (unbound) (S) (unbound) Kill the
current line and enter insert mode.</p>

<p>copy-region-as-kill (ESC-W ESC-w) (unbound) (unbound)
Copy the area from the cursor to the mark to the kill
buffer.</p>

<p>If called from a ZLE widget function in the form zle
copy-region-as-kill string then string will be taken as the
text to copy to the kill buffer. The cursor, the mark and
the text on the command line are not used in this case.</p>

<p>copy-prev-word (ESC-^_) (unbound) (unbound) Duplicate
the word to the left of the cursor.</p>

<p>copy-prev-shell-word Like copy-prev-word, but the word
is found by using shell pars- ing, whereas copy-prev-word
looks for blanks. This makes a dif- ference when the word is
quoted and contains spaces.</p>

<p>vi-delete (unbound) (d) (unbound) Read a movement
command from the keyboard, and kill from the cursor position
to the endpoint of the movement. If the command is
vi-delete, kill the current line.</p>

cursor back to wherever insert mode was last entered.</p>

<p>vi-kill-eol (unbound) (D) (unbound) Kill from the cursor

current line.</p>

<p>vi-match-bracket (^X^B) (%) (unbound) Move to the
bracket character (one of {}, () or []) that matches the one
under the cursor. If the cursor is not on a bracket
character, move forward without going past the end of the

above the cursor and enter insert mode.</p>

<p>vi-open-line-below (unbound) (o) (unbound) Open a line
below the cursor and enter insert mode.</p>

<p>vi-oper-swap-case Read a movement command from the
keyboard, and swap the case of all characters from the

movement command is vi-oper-swap-case, swap the case of all
characters on the current line.</p>

<p>overwrite-mode (^X^O) (unbound) (unbound) Toggle between
overwrite mode and insert mode.</p>

<p>vi-put-before (unbound) (P) (unbound) Insert the
contents of the kill buffer before the cursor. If the kill
buffer contains a sequence of lines (as opposed to
characters), paste it above the current line.</p>

<p>vi-put-after (unbound) (p) (unbound) Insert the contents
of the kill buffer after the cursor. If the kill buffer
contains a sequence of lines (as opposed to charac- ters),
paste it below the current line.</p>

<p>quoted-insert (^V) (unbound) (unbound) Insert the next
character typed into the buffer literally. An interrupt
character will not be inserted.</p>

<p>vi-quoted-insert (unbound) (unbound) (^Q ^V) Display a ^

typed into the buffer literally. An interrupt character will
not be inserted.</p>

and convert all characters t.</p>

<p>quote-region (ESC-&quot;) (unbound) (unbound) Quote the
region from the cursor to the mark.</p>

<p>vi-replace (unbound) (R) (unbound) Enter overwrite
mode.</p>

<p>vi-repeat-change (unbound) (.) (unbound) Repeat the last
vi mode text modification. If a count was used with the
modification, it is remembered. If a count is given to this
command, it overrides the remembered count, and is remem-
bered for future uses of this command. The cut buffer
specifi- cation is similarly remembered.</p>

<p>vi-replace-chars (unbound) (r) (unbound) Replace the
character under the cursor with a character read from the
keyboard.</p>

<p>self-insert (printable characters) (unbound) (printable
characters and some control characters) Insert a character
into the buffer at the cursor position.</p>

<p>self-insert-unmeta (ESC-^I ESC-^J ESC-^M) (unbound)
(unbound) Insert a character into the buffer after stripping
the meta bit and converting ^M to ^J.</p>

<p>vi-substitute (unbound) (s) (unbound) Substitute the
next character(s).</p>

<p>vi-swap-case (unbound) (~) (unbound) Swap the case of
the character under the cursor and move past it.</p>

<p>transpose-chars (^T) (unbound) (unbound) Exchange the

<p>vi-unindent (unbound) (&lt;) (unbound) Unindent a number
of lines.</p>

<p>up-case-word (ESC-U ESC-u) (unbound) (unbound) Convert
the current word to all caps and move past it.</p>

<p>yank (^Y) (unbound) (unbound) Insert the contents of the
kill buffer at the cursor position.</p>

<p>yank-pop (ESC-y) (unbound) (unbound) Remove the text
just yanked, rotate the kill-ring (the history of previously
killed text) and yank the new top. Only works following yank
or yank-pop.</p>

<p>vi-yank (unbound) (y) (unbound) Read a movement command
from the keyboard, and copy the region from the cursor
position to the endpoint of the movement into the kill
buffer. If the command is vi-yank, copy the current
line.</p>

<p>vi-yank-whole-line (unbound) (Y) (unbound) Copy the
current line into the kill buffer.</p>

<p>vi-yank-eol Copy the region from the cursor position to
the end of the line into the kill buffer. Arguably, this is
what Y should do in vi, but it isnt what it actually
does.</p>

<p>Arguments digit-argument (ESC-0..ESC-9) (1-9) (unbound)
Start a new numeric argument, or add to the current one. See
also vi-digit-or-beginning-of-line. This only works if bound
to a key sequence ending in a decimal digit.</p>

<p>Inside a widget function, a call to this function treats
the last key of the key sequence which called the widget as
the digit.</p>

<p>neg-argument (ESC--) (unbound) (unbound) Changes the
sign of the following argument.</p>

<p>universal-argument Multiply the argument of the next
command by 4. Alternatively, if this command is followed by
an integer (positive or nega- tive), use that as the
argument for the next command. Thus dig- its cannot be
repeated using this command. For example, if this command
occurs twice, followed immediately by forward-char, move
forward sixteen spaces; if instead it is followed by -2,
then forward-char, move backward two spaces.</p>

<p>Inside a widget function, if passed an argument, i.e.
zle uni- versal-argument num, the numerical argument will be
set to num; this is equivalent to NUMERIC=num.</p>

<p>argument-base Use the existing numeric argument as a
numeric base, which must be in the range 2 to 36 inclusive.
Subsequent use of digit-argument and universal-argument will
input a new prefix in the given base. The usual hexadecimal
convention is used: the letter a or A corresponds to 10, and
so on. Arguments in bases requiring digits from 10 upwards
are more conveniently input with universal-argument, since
ESC-a etc. are not usually bound to digit-argument.</p>

<p>The function can be used with a command argument inside
a user-defined widget. The following code sets the base to
16 and lets the user input a hexadecimal argument until a
key out of the digit range is typed:</p>

<p>zle argument-base 16 zle universal-argument</p>

<p>Completion accept-and-menu-complete In a menu
completion, insert the current completion into the buffer,
and advance to the next possible completion.</p>

<p>complete-word Attempt completion on the current
word.</p>

<p>delete-char-or-list (^D) (unbound) (unbound) Delete the
character under the cursor. If the cursor is at the end of
the line, list possible completions for the current
word.</p>

<p>expand-cmd-path Expand the current command to its full
pathname.</p>

<p>expand-or-complete (TAB) (unbound) (TAB) Attempt shell
expansion on the current word. If that fails, attempt
completion.</p>

<p>expand-or-complete-prefix Attempt shell expansion on the
current word up to cursor.</p>

<p>expand-history (ESC-space ESC-!) (unbound) (unbound)
Perform history expansion on the edit buffer.</p>

<p>expand-word (^X*) (unbound) (unbound) Attempt shell
expansion on the current word.</p>

<p>list-choices (ESC-^D) (^D =) (^D) List possible
completions for the current word.</p>

<p>list-expand (^Xg ^XG) (^G) (^G) List the expansion of
the current word.</p>

<p>magic-space Perform history expansion and insert a space
into the buffer. This is intended to be bound to space.</p>

<p>menu-complete Like complete-word, except that menu
completion is used. See the MENU_COMPLETE option.</p>

<p>menu-expand-or-complete Like expand-or-complete, except
that menu completion is used.</p>

<p>reverse-menu-complete Perform menu completion, like
menu-complete, except that if a menu completion is already
in progress, move to the previous completion rather than the
next.</p>

<p>end-of-list When a previous completion displayed a list
below the prompt, this widget can be used to move the prompt
below the list.</p>

<p>Miscellaneous accept-and-hold (ESC-A ESC-a) (unbound)
(unbound) Push the contents of the buffer on the buffer
stack and execute it.</p>

<p>accept-and-infer-next-history Execute the contents of
the buffer. Then search the history list for a line matching
the current one and push the event fol- lowing onto the
buffer stack.</p>

<p>accept-line (^J ^M) (^J ^M) (^J ^M) Finish editing the
buffer. Normally this causes the buffer to be executed as a
shell command.</p>

<p>accept-line-and-down-history (^O) (unbound) (unbound)
Execute the current line, and push the next history event on
the the buffer stack.</p>

<p>auto-suffix-remove If the previous action added a suffix
(space, slash, etc.) to the word on the command line, remove
it. Otherwise do nothing. Removing the suffix ends any
active menu completion or menu selection.</p>

<p>This widget is intended to be called from user-defined
widgets to enforce a desired suffix-removal behavior.</p>

<p>auto-suffix-retain If the previous action added a suffix
(space, slash, etc.) to the word on the command line, force
it to be preserved. Other- wise do nothing. Retaining the
suffix ends any active menu com- pletion or menu
selection.</p>

<p>This widget is intended to be called from user-defined
widgets to enforce a desired suffix-preservation
behavior.</p>

<p>beep Beep, unless the BEEP option is unset.</p>

<p>vi-cmd-mode (^X^V) (unbound) (^[) Enter command mode;
that is, select the vicmd keymap. Yes, this is bound by
default in emacs mode.</p>

<p>vi-caps-lock-panic Hang until any lowercase key is
pressed. This is for vi users without the mental capacity to
keep track of their caps lock key (like the author).</p>

<p>clear-screen (^L ESC-^L) (^L) (^L) Clear the screen and
redraw the prompt.</p>

<p>describe-key-briefly Reads a key sequence, then prints
the function bound to that sequence.</p>

<p>exchange-point-and-mark (^X^X) (unbound) (unbound)
Exchange the cursor position (point) with the position of
the mark. Unless a negative prefix argument is given, the
region between point and mark is activated so that it can be
high- lighted. If a zero prefix argument is given, the
region is activated but point and mark are not swapped.</p>

<p>execute-named-cmd (ESC-x) (:) (unbound) Read the name of
an editor command and execute it. A restricted set of
editing functions is available in the mini-buffer. Keys are
looked up in the special command keymap, and if not found
there in the main keymap. An interrupt signal, as defined by
the stty setting, will abort the function. The allowed
functions are: backward-delete-char,
vi-backward-delete-char, clear-screen, redisplay,
quoted-insert, vi-quoted-insert, back- ward-kill-word,
vi-backward-kill-word, kill-whole-line, vi-kill-line,
backward-kill-line, list-choices, delete-char-or-list,
complete-word, accept-line, expand-or-com- plete and
expand-or-complete-prefix.</p>

<p>kill-region kills the last word, and vi-cmd-mode is
treated the same as accept-line. The space and tab
characters, if not bound to one of these functions, will
complete the name and then list the possibilities if the
AUTO_LIST option is set. Any other character that is not
bound to self-insert or self-insert-unmeta will beep and be
ignored. The bindings of the current insert mode will be
used.</p>

<p>Currently this command may not be redefined or called by
name.</p>

<p>execute-last-named-cmd (ESC-z) (unbound) (unbound) Redo
the last function executed with execute-named-cmd.</p>

<p>Currently this command may not be redefined or called by
name.</p>

<p>get-line (ESC-G ESC-g) (unbound) (unbound) Pop the top
line off the buffer stack and insert it at the cur- sor
position.</p>

<p>pound-insert (unbound) (#) (unbound) If there is no #
character at the beginning of the buffer, add one to the
beginning of each line. If there is one, remove a # from
each line that has one. In either case, accept the current
line. The INTERACTIVE_COMMENTS option must be set for this
to have any usefulness.</p>

<p>vi-pound-insert If there is no # character at the
beginning of the current line, add one. If there is one,
remove it. The INTERACTIVE_COMMENTS option must be set for
this to have any usefulness.</p>

<p>push-input Push the entire current multiline construct
onto the buffer stack and return to the top-level (PS1)
prompt. If the current parser construct is only a single
line, this is exactly like push-line. Next time the editor
starts up or is popped with get-line, the construct will be
popped off the top of the buffer stack and loaded into the
editing buffer.</p>

<p>push-line (^Q ESC-Q ESC-q) (unbound) (unbound) Push the
current buffer onto the buffer stack and clear the buffer.
Next time the editor starts up, the buffer will be popped
off the top of the buffer stack and loaded into the edit-
ing buffer.</p>

<p>push-line-or-edit At the top-level (PS1) prompt,
equivalent to push-line. At a secondary (PS2) prompt, move
the entire current multiline con- struct into the editor
buffer. The latter is equivalent to push-input followed by
get-line.</p>

<p>read-command Only useful from a user-defined widget. A
keystroke is read just as in normal operation, but instead
of the command being executed the name of the command that
would be executed is stored in the shell parameter REPLY.
This can be used as the argument of a future zle command. If
the key sequence is not bound, status 1 is returned;
typically, however, REPLY is set to undefined-key to
indicate a useless key sequence.</p>

<p>recursive-edit Only useful from a user-defined widget.
At this point in the function, the editor regains control
until one of the standard widgets which would normally cause
zle to exit (typically an accept-line caused by hitting the
return key) is executed. Instead, control returns to the
user-defined widget. The status returned is non-zero if the
return was caused by an error, but the function still
continues executing and hence may tidy up. This makes it
safe for the user-defined widget to alter the com- mand line
or key bindings temporarily.</p>

<p>The following widget, caps-lock, serves as an example.
self-insert-ucase() { LBUFFER+=${(U)KEYS[-1]} }</p>

<p>integer stat</p>

<p>zle -N self-insert self-insert-ucase zle -A caps-lock
save-caps-lock zle -A accept-line caps-lock</p>

<p>zle recursive-edit stat=$?</p>

<p>zle -A .self-insert self-insert zle -A save-caps-lock
caps-lock zle -D save-caps-lock</p>

<p>(( stat )) &amp;&amp; zle send-break</p>

<p>return $stat This causes typed letters to be inserted
capitalised until either accept-line (i.e. typically the
return key) is typed or the caps-lock widget is invoked
again; the later is handled by saving the old definition of
caps-lock as save-caps-lock and then rebinding it to invoke
accept-line. Note that an error from the recursive edit is
detected as a non-zero return status and propagated by using
the send-break widget.</p>

<p>redisplay (unbound) (^R) (^R) Redisplays the edit
buffer.</p>

<p>reset-prompt (unbound) (unbound) (unbound) Force the
prompts on both the left and right of the screen to be
re-expanded, then redisplay the edit buffer. This reflects
changes both to the prompt variables themselves and changes
in the expansion of the values (for example, changes in time
or directory, or changes to the value of variables referred
to by the prompt).</p>

<p>Otherwise, the prompt is only expanded each time zle
starts, and when the display as been interrupted by output
from another part of the shell (such as a job notification)
which causes the com- mand line to be reprinted.</p>

<p>send-break (^G ESC-^G) (unbound) (unbound) Abort the
current editor function, e.g. execute-named-command, or the
editor itself, e.g. if you are in vared. Otherwise abort the
parsing of the current line.</p>

<p>run-help (ESC-H ESC-h) (unbound) (unbound) Push the
buffer onto the buffer stack, and execute the command
run-help cmd , where cmd is the current command. run-help is
normally aliased to man.</p>

<p>vi-set-buffer (unbound) (&quot;) (unbound) Specify a
buffer to be used in the following command. There are 35
buffers that can be specified: the 26 named buffers &quot;a
to &quot;z and the nine queued buffers &quot;1 to &quot;9.
The named buffers can also be specified as &quot;A to
&quot;Z.</p>

<p>When a buffer is specified for a cut command, the text
being cut replaces the previous contents of the specified
buffer. If a named buffer is specified using a capital, the
newly cut text is appended to the buffer instead of
overwriting it.</p>

<p>If no buffer is specified for a cut command, &quot;1 is
used, and the contents of &quot;1 to &quot;8 are each
shifted along one buffer; the con- tents of &quot;9 is
lost.</p>

<p>vi-set-mark (unbound) (m) (unbound) Set the specified
mark at the cursor position.</p>

<p>set-mark-command (^@) (unbound) (unbound) Set the mark
at the cursor position. If called with a negative prefix
argument, do not set the mark but deactivate the region so
that it is no longer highlighted (it is still usable for
other purposes). Otherwise the region is marked as
active.</p>

<p>spell-word (ESC-$ ESC-S ESC-s) (unbound) (unbound)
Attempt spelling correction on the current word.</p>

<p>undefined-key This command is executed when a key
sequence that is not bound to any command is typed. By
default it beeps.</p>

<p>undo (^_ ^Xu ^X^U) (unbound) (unbound) Incrementally
undo the last text modification.</p>

<p>redo Incrementally redo undone text modifications.</p>

<p>vi-undo-change (unbound) (u) (unbound) Undo the last
text modification. If repeated, redo the modifi- cation.</p>

<p>what-cursor-position (^X=) (unbound) (unbound) Print the
character under the cursor, its code as an octal, dec- imal
and hexadecimal number, the current cursor position within
the buffer and the column of the cursor in the current
line.</p>

<p>where-is Read the name of an editor command and and
print the listing of key sequences that invoke the specified
command. A restricted set of editing functions is available
in the mini-buffer. Keys are looked up in the special
command keymap, and if not found there in the main
keymap.</p>

<p>which-command (ESC-?) (unbound) (unbound) Push the
buffer onto the buffer stack, and execute the command
which-command cmd. where cmd is the current command.
which-command is normally aliased to whence.</p>

<p>vi-digit-or-beginning-of-line (unbound) (0) (unbound) If
the last command executed was a digit as part of an
argument, continue the argument. Otherwise, execute
vi-beginning-of-line.</p>

<p>CHARACTER HIGHLIGHTING The line editor has the ability
to highlight characters or regions of the line that have a
particular significance. This is controlled by the array
parameter zle_highlight, if it has been set by the user.</p>

<p>If the parameter contains the single entry none all
highlighting is turned off. Note the parameter is still
expected to be an array.</p>

<p>Otherwise each entry of the array should consist of a
word indicating a context for highlighting, then a colon,
then a comma-separated list of the types of highlighting to
apply in that context.</p>

<p>The contexts available for highlighting are the
following:</p>

<p>default Any text within the command line not affected by
any other high- lighting. Text outside the editable area of
the command line is not affected.</p>

<p>isearch When one of the incremental history search
widgets is active, the area of the command line matched by
the search string or pattern.</p>

<p>region The region between the cursor (point) and the
mark as set with set-mark-command. The region is only
highlighted if it is active, which is the case if
set-mark-command or exchange-point-and-mark has been called
and the line has not been subsequently modified. The region
can be deactivated by calling set-mark-command with a
negative prefix argument, or reactivated by calling
exchange-point-and-mark with a zero pre- fix argument. Note
that whether or not the region is active has no effect on
its use within widgets, it simply determines whether it is
highlighted.</p>

<p>special Individual characters that have no direct
printable representa- tion but are shown in a special manner
by the line editor. These characters are described
below.</p>

<p>zle_highlight may contain additional fields for
controlling how termi- nal sequences to change colours are
output. Each of the following is followed by a colon and a
string in the same form as for key bindings. This will not
be necessary for the vast majority of terminals as the
defaults shown in parentheses are widely used.</p>

<p>fg_start_code e[3) The start of the escape sequence for
the foreground colour. This is followed by an ASCII digit
representing the colour.</p>

<p>fg_default_code (9) The number to use instead of the
colour to reset the default foreground colour.</p>

<p>fg_end_code (m) The end of the escape sequence for the
foreground colour.</p>

<p>bg_start_code e[4) The start of the escape sequence for
the background colour. This is followed by an ASCII digit
representing the colour.</p>

<p>bg_default_code (9) The number to use instead of the
colour to reset the default background colour.</p>

<p>bg_end_code (m) The end of the escape sequence for the
background colour.</p>

<p>The available types of highlighting are the following.
Note that not all types of highlighting are available on all
terminals:</p>

<p>none No highlighting is applied to the given context. It
is not use- ful for this to appear with other types of
highlighting; it is used to override a default.</p>

<p>fg=colour The foreground colour should be set to colour,
a decimal integer or the name of one of the eight most
widely-supported colours.</p>

<p>Not all terminals support this and, of those that do,
not all provide facilities to test the support, hence the
user should decide based on the terminal type. Most
terminals support the colours black, red, green, yellow,
blue, magenta, cyan and white, which can be set by name. In
addition. default may be used to set the terminal s default
foreground colour. Abbrevia- tions are allowed; b or bl
selects black. Some terminals may generate additional
colours if the bold attribute is also present.</p>

<p>On recent terminals and on systems with an up-to-date
terminal database the number of colours supported may be
tested by the command echotc Co; if this succeeds, it
indicates a limit on the number of colours which will be
enforced by the line editor. The number of colours is in any
case limited to 256 (i.e. the range 0 to 255).</p>

<p>Colour is also known as color.</p>

<p>bg=colour The background colour should be set to colour.
This works simi- larly to the foreground colour, except the
background is not usually affected by the bold
attribute.</p>

<p>bold The characters in the given context are shown in a
bold font.</p>

<p>standout The characters in the given context are shown
in the terminals standout mode. The actual effect is
specific to the terminal; on many terminals it is inverse
video. On some such terminals, where the cursor does not
blink it appears with standout mode negated, making it less
than clear where the cursor actually is. On such terminals
one of the other effects may be preferable for highlighting
the region and matched search string.</p>

<p>underline The characters in the given context are shown
underlined. Some terminals show the foreground in a
different colour instead; in this case whitespace will not
be highlighted.</p>

<p>The characters described above as special are as
follows. The for- matting described here is used
irrespective of whether the characters are highlighted:</p>

<p>ASCII control characters Control characters in the ASCII
range are shown as ^ followed by the base character.</p>

<p>Unprintable multibyte characters This item applies to
control characters not in the ASCII range, plus other
characters as follows. If the MULTIBYTE option is in effect,
multibyte characters not in the ASCII character set that are
reported as having zero width are treated as combining char-
acters when the option COMBINING_CHARS is on. If the option
is off, or if a character appears where a combining
character is not valid, the character is treated as
unprintable.</p>

<p>Unprintable multibyte characters are shown as a
hexadecimal num- ber between angle brackets. The number is
the code point of the character in the wide character set;
this may or may not be Uni- code, depending on the operating
system.</p>

<p>If zle_highlight is not set or no value applies to a
particular con- text, the defaults applied are equivalent
to</p>

<p>zle_highlight=(region:standout special:standout
isearch:underline)</p>

<p>i.e. both the region and special characters are shown in
standout mode.</p>

<p>Within widgets, arbitrary regions may be highlighted by
setting the special array parameter region_highlight; see
above.</p>

<p>ZSHCOMPWID(1) ZSHCOMPWID(1)</p>

<p>NAME zshcompwid - zsh completion widgets</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The shell s programmable completion
mechanism can be manipulated in two ways; here the low-level
features supporting the newer, function-based mechanism are
defined. A complete set of shell functions based on these
features is described in zshcompsys(1), and users with no
inter- est in adding to that system (or, potentially,
writing their own -- see dictionary entry for hubris )
should skip the current section. The older system based on
the compctl builtin command is described in zsh-
compctl(1).</p>

<p>Completion widgets are defined by the -C option to the
zle builtin com- mand provided by the zsh/zle module (see
zshzle(1)). For example,</p>

<p>zle -C complete expand-or-complete completer</p>

<p>defines a widget named complete. The second argument is
the name of any of the builtin widgets that handle
completions: complete-word, expand-or-complete,
expand-or-complete-prefix, menu-complete,
menu-expand-or-complete, reverse-menu-complete,
list-choices, or delete-char-or-list. Note that this will
still work even if the widget in question has been
re-bound.</p>

<p>When this newly defined widget is bound to a key using
the bindkey builtin command defined in the zsh/zle module
(see zshzle(1)), typing that key will call the shell
function completer. This function is responsible for
generating the possible matches using the builtins described
below. As with other ZLE widgets, the function is called
with its standard input closed.</p>

<p>Once the function returns, the completion code takes
over control again and treats the matches in the same manner
as the specified builtin wid- get, in this case
expand-or-complete.</p>

<p>COMPLETION SPECIAL PARAMETERS The parameters
ZLE_REMOVE_SUFFIX_CHARS and ZLE_SPACE_SUFFIX_CHARS are used
by the completion mechanism, but are not special. See
Parameters Used By The Shell in zshparam(1).</p>

<p>Inside completion widgets, and any functions called from
them, some parameters have special meaning; outside these
functions they are not special to the shell in any way.
These parameters are used to pass information between the
completion code and the completion widget. Some of the
builtin commands and the condition codes use or change the
cur- rent values of these parameters. Any existing values
will be hidden during execution of completion widgets;
except for compstate, the parameters are reset on each
function exit (including nested function calls from within
the completion widget) to the values they had when the
function was entered.</p>

<p>CURRENT This is the number of the current word, i.e. the
word the cursor is currently on in the words array. Note
that this value is only correct if the ksharrays option is
not set.</p>

<p>IPREFIX Initially this will be set to the empty string.
This parameter functions like PREFIX; it contains a string
which precedes the one in PREFIX and is not considered part
of the list of matches. Typically, a string is transferred
from the beginning of PREFIX to the end of IPREFIX, for
example:</p>

<p>IPREFIX=${PREFIX%=*}= PREFIX=${PREFIX#*=}</p>

<p>causes the part of the prefix up to and including the
first equal sign not to be treated as part of a matched
string. This can be done automatically by the compset
builtin, see below.</p>

<p>ISUFFIX As IPREFIX, but for a suffix that should not be
considered part of the matches; note that the ISUFFIX string
follows the SUFFIX string.</p>

<p>PREFIX Initially this will be set to the part of the
current word from the beginning of the word up to the
position of the cursor; it may be altered to give a common
prefix for all matches.</p>

<p>QIPREFIX This parameter is read-only and contains the
quoted string up to the word being completed. E.g. when
completing &quot;foo, this parameter contains the double
quote. If the -q option of compset is used (see below), and
the original string was &quot;foo bar with the cursor on the
bar, this parameter contains &quot;foo .</p>

<p>QISUFFIX Like QIPREFIX, but containing the suffix.</p>

<p>SUFFIX Initially this will be set to the part of the
current word from the cursor position to the end; it may be
altered to give a com- mon suffix for all matches. It is
most useful when the option COMPLETE_IN_WORD is set, as
otherwise the whole word on the com- mand line is treated as
a prefix.</p>

<p>compstate This is an associative array with various keys
and values that the completion code uses to exchange
information with the com- pletion widget. The keys are:</p>

<p>all_quotes The -q option of the compset builtin command
(see below) allows a quoted string to be broken into
separate words; if the cursor is on one of those words, that
word will be completed, possibly invoking compset -q
recursively. With this key it is possible to test the types
of quoted strings which are currently broken into parts in
this fashion. Its value contains one character for each
quot- ing level. The characters are a single quote or a
double quote for strings quoted with these characters, a
dollars sign for strings quoted with ...and a backslash for
strings not starting with a quote character. The first
character in the value always corresponds to the inner- most
quoting level.</p>

<p>context This will be set by the completion code to the
overall context in which completion is attempted. Possible
values are:</p>

<p>array_value when completing inside the value of an array
parameter assignment; in this case the words array contains
the words inside the parentheses.</p>

<p>brace_parameter when completing the name of a parameter
in a parameter expansion beginning with ${.</p>

<p>assign_parameter when completing the name of a parameter
in a parameter assignment.</p>

<p>command when completing for a normal command (either in
command position or for an argument of the com- mand).</p>

<p>condition when completing inside a [[...]] conditional
expression; in this case the words array contains only the
words inside the conditional expression.</p>

<p>math when completing in a mathematical environment such
as a ((...)) construct.</p>

<p>parameter when completing the name of a parameter in a
parameter expansion beginning with $ but not ${.</p>

<p>redirect when completing after a redirection
operator.</p>

<p>subscript when completing inside a parameter
subscript.</p>

<p>value when completing the value of a parameter assign-
ment.</p>

<p>exact Controls the behaviour when the REC_EXACT option
is set. It will be set to accept if an exact match would be
accepted, and will be unset otherwise.</p>

<p>If it was set when at least one match equal to the
string on the line was generated, the match is accepted.</p>

<p>exact_string The string of an exact match if one was
found, otherwise unset.</p>

<p>ignored The number of words that were ignored because
they matched one of the patterns given with the -F option to
the compadd builtin command.</p>

<p>insert This controls the manner in which a match is
inserted into the command line. On entry to the widget
function, if it is unset the command line is not to be
changed; if set to unambiguous, any prefix common to all
matches is to be inserted; if set to automenu-unambiguous,
the com- mon prefix is to be inserted and the next
invocation of the completion code may start menu completion
(due to the AUTO_MENU option being set); if set to menu or
automenu menu completion will be started for the matches
currently generated (in the latter case this will happen
because the AUTO_MENU is set). The value may also contain
the string tab when the completion code would normally not
really do completion, but only insert the TAB character.</p>

<p>On exit it may be set to any of the values above (where
setting it to the empty string is the same as unsetting it),
or to a number, in which case the match whose number is
given will be inserted into the command line. Nega- tive
numbers count backward from the last match (with -1
selecting the last match) and out-of-range values are
wrapped around, so that a value of zero selects the last
match and a value one more than the maximum selects the
first. Unless the value of this key ends in a space, the
match is inserted as in a menu completion, i.e. with- out
automatically appending a space.</p>

<p>Both menu and automenu may also specify the the number
of the match to insert, given after a colon. For example,
menu:2 says to start menu completion, beginning with the
second match.</p>

<p>Note that a value containing the substring tab makes the
matches generated be ignored and only the TAB be
inserted.</p>

<p>Finally, it may also be set to all, which makes all
matches generated be inserted into the line.</p>

<p>insert_positions When the completion system inserts an
unambiguous string into the line, there may be multiple
places where charac- ters are missing or where the character
inserted differs from at least one match. The value of this
key contains a colon separated list of all these positions,
as indexes into the command line.</p>

<p>last_prompt If this is set to a non-empty string for
every match added, the completion code will move the cursor
back to the previous prompt after the list of completions
has been displayed. Initially this is set or unset according
to the ALWAYS_LAST_PROMPT option.</p>

<p>list This controls whether or how the list of matches
will be displayed. If it is unset or empty they will never
be listed; if its value begins with list, they will always
be listed; if it begins with autolist or ambiguous, they
will be listed when the AUTO_LIST or LIST_AMBIGUOUS options
respectively would normally cause them to be.</p>

<p>If the substring force appears in the value, this makes
the list be shown even if there is only one match. Nor-
mally, the list would be shown only if there are at least
two matches.</p>

<p>The value contains the substring packed if the
LIST_PACKED option is set. If this substring is given for
all matches added to a group, this group will show the
LIST_PACKED behavior. The same is done for the
LIST_ROWS_FIRST option with the substring rows.</p>

<p>Finally, if the value contains the string explanations,
only the explanation strings, if any, will be listed and if
it contains messages, only the messages (added with the -x
option of compadd) will be listed. If it contains both
explanations and messages both kinds of explanation strings
will be listed. It will be set appropriately on entry to a
completion widget and may be changed there.</p>

<p>list_lines This gives the number of lines that are
needed to display the full list of completions. Note that to
calculate the total number of lines to display you need to
add the num- ber of lines needed for the command line to
this value, this is available as the value of the
BUFFERLINES special parameter.</p>

<p>list_max Initially this is set to the value of the
LISTMAX parame- ter. It may be set to any other value; when
the widget exits this value will be used in the same way as
the value of LISTMAX.</p>

<p>nmatches The number of matches generated and accepted by
the com- pletion code so far.</p>

<p>old_insert On entry to the widget this will be set to
the number of the match of an old list of completions that
is currently inserted into the command line. If no match has
been inserted, this is unset.</p>

<p>As with old_list, the value of this key will only be
used if it is the string keep. If it was set to this value
by the widget and there was an old match inserted into the
command line, this match will be kept and if the value of
the insert key specifies that another match should be
inserted, this will be inserted after the old one.</p>

<p>old_list This is set to yes if there is still a valid
list of com- pletions from a previous completion at the time
the wid- get is invoked. This will usually be the case if
and only if the previous editing operation was a completion
widget or one of the builtin completion functions. If there
is a valid list and it is also currently shown on the
screen, the value of this key is shown.</p>

<p>After the widget has exited the value of this key is
only used if it was set to keep. In this case the completion
code will continue to use this old list. If the widget
generated new matches, they will not be used.</p>

<p>parameter The name of the parameter when completing in a
subscript or in the value of a parameter assignment.</p>

<p>pattern_insert Normally this is set to menu, which
specifies that menu completion will be used whenever a set
of matches was generated using pattern matching. If it is
set to any other non-empty string by the user and menu
completion is not selected by other option settings, the
code will instead insert any common prefix for the generated
matches as with normal completion.</p>

<p>pattern_match Locally controls the behaviour given by
the GLOB_COMPLETE option. Initially it is set to * if and
only if the option is set. The completion widget may set it
to this value, to an empty string (which has the same effect
as unsetting it), or to any other non-empty string. If it is
non-empty, unquoted metacharacters on the command line will
be treated as patterns; if it is * , then addition- ally a
wildcard * is assumed at the cursor position; if it is empty
or unset, metacharacters will be treated lit- erally.</p>

<p>Note that the matcher specifications given to the
compadd builtin command are not used if this is set to a
non-empty string.</p>

<p>quote When completing inside quotes, this contains the
quota- tion character (i.e. either a single quote, a double
quote, or a backtick). Otherwise it is unset.</p>

<p>quoting When completing inside single quotes, this is
set to the string single; inside double quotes, the string
double; inside backticks, the string backtick. Otherwise it
is unset.</p>

<p>redirect The redirection operator when completing in a
redirection position, i.e. one of &lt;, &gt;, etc.</p>

<p>restore This is set to auto before a function is
entered, which forces the special parameters mentioned above
(words, CURRENT, PREFIX, IPREFIX, SUFFIX, and ISUFFIX) to be
restored to their previous values when the function exits.
If a function unsets it or sets it to any other string, they
will not be restored.</p>

<p>to_end Specifies the occasions on which the cursor is
moved to the end of a string when a match is inserted. On
entry to a widget function, it may be single if this will
hap- pen when a single unambiguous match was inserted or
match if it will happen any time a match is inserted (for
exam- ple, by menu completion; this is likely to be the
effect of the ALWAYS_TO_END option).</p>

<p>On exit, it may be set to single as above. It may also
be set to always, or to the empty string or unset; in those
cases the cursor will be moved to the end of the string
always or never respectively. Any other string is treated as
match.</p>

<p>unambiguous This key is read-only and will always be set
to the com- mon (unambiguous) prefix the completion code has
gener- ated for all matches added so far.</p>

<p>unambiguous_cursor This gives the position the cursor
would be placed at if the common prefix in the unambiguous
key were inserted, relative to the value of that key. The
cursor would be placed before the character whose index is
given by this key.</p>

<p>unambiguous_positions This contains all positions where
characters in the unam- biguous string are missing or where
the character inserted differs from at least one of the
matches. The positions are given as indexes into the string
given by the value of the unambiguous key.</p>

<p>vared If completion is called while editing a line using
the vared builtin, the value of this key is set to the name
of the parameter given as an argument to vared. This key is
only set while a vared command is active.</p>

<p>words This array contains the words present on the
command line cur- rently being edited.</p>

<p>COMPLETION BUILTIN COMMANDS compadd [ -akqQfenUld12C ] [
-F array ] [ -P prefix ] [ -S suffix ] [ -p hidden-prefix ]
[ -s hidden-suffix ] [ -i ignored-prefix ] [ -I
ignored-suffix ] [ -W file-prefix ] [ -d array ] [ -J name ]
[ -V name ] [ -X explanation ] [ -x message ] [ -r
remove-chars ] [ -R remove-func ] [ -D array ] [ -O array ]
[ -A array ] [ -E number ] [ -M match-spec ] [ -- ] [ words
... ]</p>

<p>This builtin command can be used to add matches directly
and control all the information the completion code stores
with each possible match. The return status is zero if at
least one match was added and non-zero if no matches were
added.</p>

<p>The completion code breaks the string to complete into
seven fields in the order:</p>


<p>&lt;ipre&gt;&lt;apre&gt;&lt;hpre&gt;&lt;word&gt;&lt;hsuf&gt;&lt;asuf&gt;&lt;isuf&gt;</p>

<p>The first field is an ignored prefix taken from the
command line, the contents of the IPREFIX parameter plus the
string given with the -i option. With the -U option, only
the string from the -i option is used. The field
&lt;apre&gt; is an optional pre- fix string given with the
-P option. The &lt;hpre&gt; field is a string that is
considered part of the match but that should not be shown
when listing completions, given with the -p option; for
example, functions that do filename generation might specify
a common path prefix this way. &lt;word&gt; is the part of
the match that should appear in the list of completions,
i.e. one of the words given at the end of the compadd
command line. The suffixes &lt;hsuf&gt;, &lt;asuf&gt; and
&lt;isuf&gt; correspond to the prefixes &lt;hpre&gt;,
&lt;apre&gt; and &lt;ipre&gt; and are given by the options
-s, -S and -I, respectively.</p>

<p>The supported flags are:</p>

<p>-P prefix This gives a string to be inserted before the
given words. The string given is not considered as part of
the match and any shell metacharacters in it will not be
quoted when the string is inserted.</p>

<p>-S suffix Like -P, but gives a string to be inserted
after the match.</p>

<p>-p hidden-prefix This gives a string that should be
inserted into the com- mand line before the match but that
should not appear in the list of matches. Unless the -U
option is given, this string must be matched as part of the
string on the com- mand line.</p>

<p>-s hidden-suffix Like -p, but gives a string to insert
after the match.</p>

<p>-i ignored-prefix This gives a string to insert into the
command line just before any string given with the -P
option. Without -P the string is inserted before the string
given with -p or directly before the match.</p>

<p>-I ignored-suffix Like -i, but gives an ignored
suffix.</p>

<p>-a With this flag the words are taken as names of arrays
and the possible matches are their values. If only some ele-
ments of the arrays are needed, the words may also con- tain
subscripts, as in foo[2,-1].</p>

<p>-k With this flag the words are taken as names of
associa- tive arrays and the possible matches are their
keys. As for -a, the words may also contain subscripts, as
in foo[(R)*bar*].</p>

<p>-d array This adds per-match display strings. The array
should contain one element per word given. The completion
code will then display the first element instead of the
first word, and so on. The array may be given as the name of
an array parameter or directly as a space-separated list of
words in parentheses.</p>

<p>If there are fewer display strings than words, the left-
over words will be displayed unchanged and if there are more
display strings than words, the leftover display strings
will be silently ignored.</p>

<p>-l This option only has an effect if used together with
the -d option. If it is given, the display strings are
listed one per line, not arrayed in columns.</p>

<p>-o This option only has an effect if used together with
the -d option. If it is given, the order of the output is
determined by the match strings; otherwise it is deter-
mined by the display strings (i.e. the strings given by the
-d option).</p>

<p>-J name Gives the name of the group of matches the words
should be stored in.</p>

<p>-V name Like -J but naming a unsorted group. These are
in a dif- ferent name space than groups created with the -J
flag.</p>

<p>-1 If given together with the -V option, makes only
consecu- tive duplicates in the group be removed. If
combined with the -J option, this has no visible effect.
Note that groups with and without this flag are in different
name spaces.</p>

<p>-2 If given together with the -J or -V option, makes all
duplicates be kept. Again, groups with and without this flag
are in different name spaces.</p>

<p>-X explanation The explanation string will be printed
with the list of matches, above the group currently
selected.</p>

<p>-x message Like -X, but the message will be printed even
if there are no matches in the group.</p>

<p>-q The suffix given with -S will be automatically
removed if the next character typed is a blank or does not
insert anything, or if the suffix consists of only one
character and the next character typed is the same
character.</p>

<p>-r remove-chars This is a more versatile form of the -q
option. The suf- fix given with -S or the slash
automatically added after completing directories will be
automatically removed if the next character typed inserts
one of the characters given in the remove-chars. This string
is parsed as a characters class and understands the
backslash sequences used by the print command. For example,
-r &quot;a-t&quot; removes the suffix if the next character
typed inserts a lower case character or a TAB, and -r
&quot;^0-9&quot; removes the suffix if the next character
typed inserts anything but a digit. One extra backslash
sequence is understood in this string: - stands for all
characters that insert nothing. Thus -S &quot;=&quot; -q is
the same as -S &quot;=&quot; -r &quot;-&quot;.</p>

<p>This option may also be used without the -S option; then
any automatically added space will be removed when one of
the characters in the list is typed.</p>

<p>-R remove-func This is another form of the -r option.
When a suffix has been inserted and the completion accepted,
the function remove-func will be called after the next
character typed. It is passed the length of the suffix as an
argu- ment and can use the special parameters available in
ordinary (non-completion) zle widgets (see zshzle(1)) to
analyse and modify the command line.</p>

<p>-f If this flag is given, all of the matches built from
words are marked as being the names of files. They are not
required to be actual filenames, but if they are, and the
option LIST_TYPES is set, the characters describing the
types of the files in the completion lists will be shown.
This also forces a slash to be added when the name of a
directory is completed.</p>

<p>-e This flag can be used to tell the completion code
that the matches added are parameter names for a parameter
expansion. This will make the AUTO_PARAM_SLASH and
AUTO_PARAM_KEYS options be used for the matches.</p>

<p>-W file-prefix This string is a pathname that will be
prepended to each of the matches formed by the given words
together with any prefix specified by the -p option to form
a complete filename for testing. Hence it is only useful if
com- bined with the -f flag, as the tests will not otherwise
be performed.</p>

<p>-F array Specifies an array containing patterns. Words
matching one of these patterns are ignored, i.e. not
considered to be possible matches.</p>

<p>The array may be the name of an array parameter or a
list of literal patterns enclosed in parentheses and quoted,
as in -F &quot;(*?.o *?.h)&quot;. If the name of an array is
given, the elements of the array are taken as the pat-
terns.</p>

<p>-Q This flag instructs the completion code not to quote
any metacharacters in the words when inserting them into the
command line.</p>

<p>-M match-spec This gives local match specifications as
described below in the section Completion Matching Control .
This option may be given more than once. In this case all
match-specs given are concatenated with spaces between them
to form the specification string to use. Note that they will
only be used if the -U option is not given.</p>

<p>-n Specifies that the words added are to be used as
possible matches, but are not to appear in the completion
listing.</p>

<p>-U If this flag is given, all words given will be
accepted and no matching will be done by the completion
code. Nor- mally this is used in functions that do the
matching themselves.</p>

<p>-O array If this option is given, the words are not
added to the set of possible completions. Instead, matching
is done as usual and all of the words given as arguments
that match the string on the command line will be stored in
the array parameter whose name is given as array.</p>

<p>-A array As the -O option, except that instead of those
of the words which match being stored in array, the strings
gen- erated internally by the completion code are stored.
For example, with a matching specification of -M
&quot;L:|no=&quot;, the string nof on the command line and
the string foo as one of the words, this option stores the
string nofoo in the array, whereas the -O option stores the
foo originally given.</p>

<p>-D array As with -O, the words are not added to the set
of possi- ble completions. Instead, the completion code
tests whether each word in turn matches what is on the line.
If the n th word does not match, the nth element of the
array is removed. Elements for which the corresponding word
is matched are retained.</p>

<p>-C This option adds a special match which expands to all
other matches when inserted into the line, even those that
are added after this option is used. Together with the -d
option it is possible to specify a string that should be
displayed in the list for this special match. If no string
is given, it will be shown as a string con- taining the
strings that would be inserted for the other matches,
truncated to the width of the screen.</p>

<p>-E This option adds number empty matches after the words
have been added. An empty match takes up space in com-
pletion listings but will never be inserted in the line and
cant be selected with menu completion or menu selec- tion.
This makes empty matches only useful to format completion
lists and to make explanatory string be shown in completion
lists (since empty matches can be given display strings with
the -d option). And because all but one empty string would
otherwise be removed, this option implies the -V and -2
options (even if an explicit -J option is given).</p>

<p>- -- This flag ends the list of flags and options. All
argu- ments after it will be taken as the words to use as
matches even if they begin with hyphens.</p>

<p>Except for the -M flag, if any of these flags is given
more than once, the first one (and its argument) will be
used.</p>

<p>compset -p number compset -P [ number ] pattern compset
-s number compset -S [ number ] pattern compset -n begin [
end ] compset -N beg-pat [ end-pat ] compset -q This command
simplifies modification of the special parameters, while its
return status allows tests on them to be carried out.</p>

<p>The options are:</p>

<p>-p number If the contents of the PREFIX parameter is
longer than number characters, the first number characters
are removed from it and appended to the contents of the
IPREFIX parameter.</p>

<p>-P [ number ] pattern If the value of the PREFIX
parameter begins with anything that matches the pattern, the
matched portion is removed from PREFIX and appended to
IPREFIX.</p>

<p>Without the optional number, the longest match is taken,
but if number is given, anything up to the numberth match is
moved. If the number is negative, the numberth longest match
is moved. For example, if PREFIX contains the string a=b=c,
then compset -P = will move the string a=b= into the IPREFIX
parameter, but compset -P 1=will move only the string
a=.</p>

<p>-s number As -p, but transfer the last number characters
from the value of SUFFIX to the front of the value of
ISUFFIX.</p>

<p>-S [ number ] pattern As -P, but match the last portion
of SUFFIX and transfer the matched portion to the front of
the value of ISUFFIX.</p>

<p>-n begin [ end ] If the current word position as
specified by the parame- ter CURRENT is greater than or
equal to begin, anything up to the beginth word is removed
from the words array and the value of the parameter CURRENT
is decremented by begin.</p>

<p>If the optional end is given, the modification is done
only if the current word position is also less than or equal
to end. In this case, the words from position end onwards
are also removed from the words array.</p>

<p>Both begin and end may be negative to count backwards
from the last element of the words array.</p>

<p>-N beg-pat [ end-pat ] If one of the elements of the
words array before the one at the index given by the value
of the parameter CURRENT matches the pattern beg-pat, all
elements up to and including the matching one are removed
from the words array and the value of CURRENT is changed to
point to the same word in the changed array.</p>

<p>If the optional pattern end-pat is also given, and there
is an element in the words array matching this pattern, the
parameters are modified only if the index of this word is
higher than the one given by the CURRENT parame- ter (so
that the matching word has to be after the cur- sor). In
this case, the words starting with the one matching end-pat
are also removed from the words array. If words contains no
word matching end-pat, the testing and modification is
performed as if it were not given.</p>

<p>-q The word currently being completed is split on spaces
into separate words, respecting the usual shell quoting
conventions. The resulting words are stored in the words
array, and CURRENT, PREFIX, SUFFIX, QIPREFIX, and QISUF- FIX
are modified to reflect the word part that is com-
pleted.</p>

<p>In all the above cases the return status is zero if the
test succeeded and the parameters were modified and non-zero
other- wise. This allows one to use this builtin in tests
such as:</p>

<p>if compset -P; then ...</p>

<p>This forces anything up to and including the last equal
sign to be ignored by the completion code.</p>

<p>compcall [ -TD ] This allows the use of completions
defined with the compctl builtin from within completion
widgets. The list of matches will be generated as if one of
the non-widget completion func- tion (complete-word, etc.)
had been called, except that only compctls given for
specific commands are used. To force the code to try
completions defined with the -T option of compctl and/or the
default completion (whether defined by compctl -D or the
builtin default) in the appropriate places, the -T and/or -D
flags can be passed to compcall.</p>

<p>The return status can be used to test if a matching
compctl def- inition was found. It is non-zero if a compctl
was found and zero otherwise.</p>

<p>Note that this builtin is defined by the zsh/compctl
module.</p>

<p>COMPLETION CONDITION CODES The following additional
condition codes for use within the [[ ... ]] construct are
available in completion widgets. These work on the spe- cial
parameters. All of these tests can also be performed by the
compset builtin, but in the case of the condition codes the
contents of the special parameters are not modified.</p>

<p>-prefix [ number ] pattern true if the test for the -P
option of compset would succeed.</p>

<p>-suffix [ number ] pattern true if the test for the -S
option of compset would succeed.</p>

<p>-after beg-pat true if the test of the -N option with
only the beg-pat given would succeed.</p>

<p>-between beg-pat end-pat true if the test for the -N
option with both patterns would suc- ceed.</p>

<p>COMPLETION MATCHING CONTROL It is possible by use of the
-M option of the compadd builtin command to specify how the
characters in the string to be completed (referred to here
as the command line) map onto the characters in the list of
matches produced by the completion code (referred to here as
the trial completions). Note that this is not used if the
command line contains a glob pattern and the GLOB_COMPLETE
option is set or the pattern_match of the compstate special
association is set to a non-empty string.</p>

<p>The match-spec given as the argument to the -M option
(see Completion Builtin Commands above) consists of one or
more matching descriptions separated by whitespace. Each
description consists of a letter fol- lowed by a colon and
then the patterns describing which character sequences on
the line match which character sequences in the trial com-
pletion. Any sequence of characters not handled in this
fashion must match exactly, as usual.</p>

<p>The forms of match-spec understood are as follows. In
each case, the form with an upper case initial character
retains the string already typed on the command line as the
final result of completion, while with a lower case initial
character the string on the command line is changed into the
corresponding part of the trial completion.</p>

<p>m:lpat=tpat M:lpat=tpat Here, lpat is a pattern that
matches on the command line, corre- sponding to tpat which
matches in the trial completion.</p>

<p>l:lanchor|lpat=tpat L:lanchor|lpat=tpat
l:lanchor||ranchor=tpat L:lanchor||ranchor=tpat b:lpat=tpat
B:lpat=tpat These letters are for patterns that are anchored
by another pat- tern on the left side. Matching for lpat and
tpat is as for m and M, but the pattern lpat matched on the
command line must be preceded by the pattern lanchor. The
lanchor can be blank to anchor the match to the start of the
command line string; other- wise the anchor can occur
anywhere, but must match in both the command line and trial
completion strings.</p>

<p>If no lpat is given but a ranchor is, this matches the
gap between substrings matched by lanchor and ranchor.
Unlike lan- chor, the ranchor only needs to match the trial
completion string.</p>

<p>The b and B forms are similar to l and L with an empty
anchor, but need to match only the beginning of the trial
completion or the word on the command line,
respectively.</p>

<p>r:lpat|ranchor=tpat R:lpat|ranchor=tpat
r:lanchor||ranchor=tpat R:lanchor||ranchor=tpat e:lpat=tpat
E:lpat=tpat As l, L, b and B, with the difference that the
command line and trial completion patterns are anchored on
the right side. Here an empty ranchor and the e and E forms
force the match to the end of the trial completion or
command line string.</p>

<p>Each lpat, tpat or anchor is either an empty string or
consists of a sequence of literal characters (which may be
quoted with a backslash), question marks, character classes,
and correspondence classes; ordinary shell patterns are not
used. Literal characters match only themselves, question
marks match any character, and character classes are formed
as for globbing and match any character in the given
set.</p>

<p>Correspondence classes are defined like character
classes, but with two differences: they are delimited by a
pair of braces, and negated classes are not allowed, so the
characters ! and ^ have no special meaning directly after
the opening brace. They indicate that a range of characters
on the line match a range of characters in the trial com-
pletion, but (unlike ordinary character classes) paired
according to the corresponding position in the sequence. For
example, to make any ASCII lower case letter on the line
match the corresponding upper case letter in the trial
completion, you can use m:{a-z}={A-Z} (however, see below
for the recommended form for this). More than one pair of
classes can occur, in which case the first class before the
= corre- sponds to the first after it, and so on. If one
side has more such classes than the other side, the
superfluous classes behave like normal character classes. In
anchor patterns correspondence classes also behave like
normal character classes.</p>

<p>The standard [:name:] forms described for standard shell
patterns, see the section FILENAME GENERATION in zshexpn(1),
may appear in corre- spondence classes as well as normal
character classes. The only spe- cial behaviour in
correspondence classes is if the form on the left and the
form on the right are each one of [:upper:], [:lower:]. In
these cases the character in the word and the character on
the line must be the same up to a difference in case. Hence
to make any lower case character on the line match the
corresponding upper case character in the trial completion
you can use m:{[:lower:]}={[:upper:]} . Although the
matching system does not yet handle multibyte characters,
this is likely to be a future extension, at which point this
syntax will handle arbitrary alphabets; hence this form,
rather than the use of explicit ranges, is the recommended
form. In other cases [:name:] forms are allowed. If the two
forms on the left and right are the same, the characters
must match exactly. In remaining cases, the corresponding
tests are applied to both characters, but they are not
otherwise con- strained; any matching character in one set
goes with any matching character in the other set: this is
equivalent to the behaviour of ordinary character
classes.</p>

<p>The pattern tpat may also be one or two stars, * or **.
This means that the pattern on the command line can match
any number of characters in the trial completion. In this
case the pattern must be anchored (on either side); in the
case of a single star, the anchor then determines how much
of the trial completion is to be included -- only the
charac- ters up to the next appearance of the anchor will be
matched. With two stars, substrings matched by the anchor
can be matched, too.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<p>The keys of the options association defined by the
parameter module are the option names in all-lower-case
form, without underscores, and with- out the optional no at
the beginning even though the builtins setopt and unsetopt
understand option names with upper case letters, under-
scores, and the optional no. The following alters the
matching rules so that the prefix no and any underscore are
ignored when trying to match the trial completions generated
and upper case letters on the line match the corresponding
lower case letters in the words:</p>

<p>compadd -M L:|[nN][oO]= M:_= M:{[:upper:]}={[:lower:]}-
${(k)options}</p>

<p>The first part says that the pattern [nN][oO] at the
beginning (the empty anchor before the pipe symbol) of the
string on the line matches the empty string in the list of
words generated by completion, so it will be ignored if
present. The second part does the same for an under- score
anywhere in the command line string, and the third part uses
cor- respondence classes so that any upper case letter on
the line matches the corresponding lower case letter in the
word. The use of the upper case forms of the specification
characters (L and M) guarantees that what has already been
typed on the command line (in particular the pre- fix no)
will not be deleted.</p>

<p>Note that the use of L in the first part means that it
matches only when at the beginning of both the command line
string and the trial completion. I.e., the string _NO_f
would not be completed to _NO_foo, nor would NONO_f be
completed to NONO_foo because of the leading underscore or
the second NO on the line which makes the pat- tern fail
even though they are otherwise ignored. To fix this, one
would use B:[nN][oO]= instead of the first part. As
described above, this matches at the beginning of the trial
completion, independent of other characters or substrings at
the beginning of the command line word which are ignored by
the same or other match-specs.</p>

<p>The second example makes completion case insensitive.
This is just the same as in the option example, except here
we wish to retain the char- acters in the list of
completions:</p>

<p>compadd -Mm:{[:lower:]}={[:upper:]}...</p>

<p>This makes lower case letters match their upper case
counterparts. To make upper case letters match the lower
case forms as well:</p>

<p>compadd -M
m:{[:lower:][:upper:]}={[:upper:][:lower:]}...</p>

<p>A nice example for the use of * patterns is partial word
completion. Sometimes you would like to make strings like
c.s.u complete to strings like comp.source.unix , i.e. the
word on the command line con- sists of multiple parts,
separated by a dot in this example, where each part should
be completed separately -- note, however, that the case
where each part of the word, i.e. comp, source and unix in
this example, is to be completed from separate sets of
matches is a differ- ent problem to be solved by the
implementation of the completion wid- get. The example can
be handled by:</p>

<p>compadd -M r:|.=* r:|=* - comp.sources.unix
comp.sources.misc ...</p>

<p>The first specification says that lpat is the empty
string, while anchor is a dot; tpat is *, so this can match
anything except for the . from the anchor in the trial
completion word. So in c.s.u, the matcher sees c, followed
by the empty string, followed by the anchor . , and likewise
for the second dot, and replaces the empty strings before
the anchors, giving c[omp].s[ources].u[nix], where the last
part of the completion is just as normal.</p>

<p>With the pattern shown above, the string c.u could not
be completed to comp.sources.unix because the single star
means that no dot (matched by the anchor) can be skipped. By
using two stars as in r:|.=** , however, c.u could be
completed to comp.sources.unix. This also shows that in some
cases, especially if the anchor is a real pattern, like a
character class, the form with two stars may result in more
matches than one would like.</p>

<p>The second specification is needed to make this work
when the cursor is in the middle of the string on the
command line and the option COM- PLETE_IN_WORD is set. In
this case the completion code would normally try to match
trial completions that end with the string as typed so far,
i.e. it will only insert new characters at the cursor
position rather then at the end. However in our example we
would like the code to recognise matches which contain extra
characters after the string on the line (the nix in the
example). Hence we say that the empty string at the end of
the string on the line matches any characters at the end of
the trial completion.</p>

<p>More generally, the specification</p>

<p>compadd -Mr:|[.,_-]=* r:|=*...</p>

<p>allows one to complete words with abbreviations before
any of the char- acters in the square brackets. For example,
to complete veryverylong- file.c rather than
veryverylongheader.h with the above in effect, you can just
type very.c before attempting completion.</p>

<p>The specifications with both a left and a right anchor
are useful to complete partial words whose parts are not
separated by some special character. For example, in some
places strings have to be completed that are formed LikeThis
(i.e. the separate parts are determined by a leading upper
case letter) or maybe one has to complete strings with
trailing numbers. Here one could use the simple form with
only one anchor as in:</p>

<p>compadd -Mr:|[[:upper:]0-9]=* r:|=*LikeTHIS FooHoo
5foo123 5bar234</p>

<p>But with this, the string H would neither complete to
FooHoo nor to LikeTHIS because in each case there is an
upper case letter before the H and that is matched by the
anchor. Likewise, a 2 would not be completed. In both cases
this could be changed by using r:|[[:upper:]0-9]=**, but
then H completes to both LikeTHIS and FooHoo and a 2 matches
the other strings because characters can be inserted before
every upper case letter and digit. To avoid this one would
use:</p>

<p>compadd -Mr:[^[:upper:]0-9]||[[:upper:]0-9]=** r:|=*
LikeTHIS FooHoo foo123 bar234</p>

<p>By using these two anchors, a H matches only upper case
Hs that are immediately preceded by something matching the
left anchor [^[:upper:]0-9]. The effect is, of course, that
H matches only the string FooHoo, a 2 matches only bar234
and so on.</p>

<p>When using the completion system (see zshcompsys(1)),
users can define match specifications that are to be used
for specific contexts by using the matcher and matcher-list
styles. The values for the latter will be used
everywhere.</p>

<p>COMPLETION WIDGET EXAMPLE The first step is to define
the widget:</p>

<p>zle -C complete complete-word complete-files</p>

<p>Then the widget can be bound to a key using the bindkey
builtin com- mand:</p>

<p>bindkey^tcomplete</p>

<p>After that the shell function complete-files will be
invoked after typ- ing control-X and TAB. The function
should then generate the matches, e.g.:</p>

<p>complete-files () { compadd - * }</p>

<p>This function will complete files in the current
directory matching the ZSHCOMPSYS(1) ZSHCOMPSYS(1)</p>

<p>current word.</p>

<p>NAME zshcompsys - zsh completion system</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This describes the shell code for the new
completion system, referred to as compsys. It is written in
shell functions based on the features described in
zshcompwid(1).</p>

<p>The features are contextual, sensitive to the point at
which completion is started. Many completions are already
provided. For this reason, a user can perform a great many
tasks without knowing any details beyond how to initialize
the system, which is described below in INITIALIZA-
TION.</p>

<p>The context that decides what completion is to be
performed may be &middot; an argument or option position:
these describe the position on the command line at which
completion is requested. For example first argument to
rmdir, the word being completed names a directory;</p>

<p>&middot; a special context, denoting an element in the
shells syntax. For example a word in command position or an
array sub- script.</p>

<p>A full context specification contains other elements, as
we shall describe.</p>

<p>Besides commands names and contexts, the system employs
two more con- cepts, styles and tags. These provide ways for
the user to configure the systems behaviour.</p>

<p>Tags play a dual role. They serve as a classification
system for the matches, typically indicating a class of
object that the user may need to distinguish. For example,
when completing arguments of the ls com- mand the user may
prefer to try files before directories, so both of these are
tags. They also appear as the rightmost element in a context
specification.</p>

<p>Styles modify various operations of the completion
system, such as out- put formatting, but also what kinds of
completers are used (and in what order), or which tags are
examined. Styles may accept arguments and are manipulated
using the zstyle command described in see zshmod-
ules(1).</p>

<p>In summary, tags describe what the completion objects
are, and style how they are to be completed. At various
points of execution, the com- pletion system checks what
styles and/or tags are defined for the cur- rent context,
and uses that to modify its behavior. The full descrip- tion
of context handling, which determines how tags and other
elements of the context influence the behaviour of styles,
is described below in COMPLETION SYSTEM CONFIGURATION.</p>

<p>When a completion is requested, a dispatcher function is
called; see the description of _main_complete in the list of
control functions below. This dispatcher decides which
function should be called to pro- duce the completions, and
calls it. The result is passed to one or more completers,
functions that implement individual completion strategies:
simple completion, error correction, completion with error
correction, menu selection, etc.</p>

<p>More generally, the shell functions contained in the
completion system are of two types: &middot; those beginning
comp are to be called directly; there are only a few of
these;</p>

<p>&middot; those beginning _ are called by the completion
code. The shell functions of this set, which implement
completion behaviour and may be bound to keystrokes, are
referred to as widgets. These proliferate as new completions
are required.</p>

<p>INITIALIZATION If the system was installed completely,
it should be enough to call the shell function compinit from
your initialization file; see the next section. However, the
function compinstall can be run by a user to configure
various aspects of the completion system.</p>

<p>Usually, compinstall will insert code into .zshrc,
although if that is not writable it will save it in another
file and tell you that files location. Note that it is up to
you to make sure that the lines added to .zshrc are actually
run; you may, for example, need to move them to an earlier
place in the file if .zshrc usually returns early. So long
as you keep them all together (including the comment lines
at the start and finish), you can rerun compinstall and it
will correctly locate and modify these lines. Note, however,
that any code you add to this sec- tion by hand is likely to
be lost if you rerun compinstall, although lines using the
command zstyle should be gracefully handled.</p>

<p>The new code will take effect next time you start the
shell, or run .zshrc by hand; there is also an option to
make them take effect imme- diately. However, if compinstall
has removed definitions, you will need to restart the shell
to see the changes.</p>

<p>To run compinstall you will need to make sure it is in a
directory men- tioned in your fpath parameter, which should
already be the case if zsh was properly configured as long
as your startup files do not remove the appropriate
directories from fpath. Then it must be autoloaded (
autoload -U compinstall is recommended). You can abort the
instal- lation any time you are being prompted for
information, and your .zshrc will not be altered at all;
changes only take place right at the end, where you are
specifically asked for confirmation.</p>

<p>Use of compinit This section describes the use of
compinit to initialize completion for the current session
when called directly; if you have run compinstall it will be
called automatically from your .zshrc.</p>

<p>To initialize the system, the function compinit should
be in a direc- tory mentioned in the fpath parameter, and
should be autoloaded (autoload -U compinit is recommended),
and then run simply as compinit . This will define a few
utility functions, arrange for all the necessary shell
functions to be autoloaded, and will then re-define all
widgets that do completion to use the new system. If you use
the menu-select widget, which is part of the zsh/complist
module, you should make sure that that module is loaded
before the call to compinit so that that widget is also
re-defined. If completion styles (see below) are set up to
perform expansion as well as completion by default, and the
TAB key is bound to expand-or-complete, compinit will rebind
it to complete-word; this is necessary to use the correct
form of expansion.</p>

<p>Should you need to use the original completion commands,
you can still bind keys to the old widgets by putting a . in
front of the widget name, e.g. .expand-or-complete.</p>

<p>To speed up the running of compinit, it can be made to
produce a dumped configuration that will be read in on
future invocations; this is the default, but can be turned
off by calling compinit with the option -D. The dumped file
is .zcompdump in the same directory as the startup files
(i.e. $ZDOTDIR or $HOME); alternatively, an explicit file
name can be given by compinit -d dumpfile. The next
invocation of compinit will read the dumped file instead of
performing a full ini- tialization.</p>

<p>If the number of completion files changes, compinit will
recognise this and produce a new dump file. However, if the
name of a function or the arguments in the first line of a
#compdef function (as described below) change, it is easiest
to delete the dump file by hand so that compinit will
re-create it the next time it is run. The check performed to
see if there are new functions can be omitted by giving the
option -C. In this case the dump file will only be created
if there isnt one already.</p>

<p>The dumping is actually done by another function,
compdump, but you will only need to run this yourself if you
change the configuration (e.g. using compdef) and then want
to dump the new one. The name of the old dumped file will be
remembered for this purpose.</p>

<p>If the parameter _compdir is set, compinit uses it as a
directory where completion functions can be found; this is
only necessary if they are not already in the function
search path.</p>

<p>For security reasons compinit also checks if the
completion system would use files not owned by root or by
the current user, or files in directories that are world- or
group-writable or that are not owned by root or by the
current user. If such files or directories are found,
compinit will ask if the completion system should really be
used. To avoid these tests and make all files found be used
without asking, use the option -u, and to make compinit
silently ignore all insecure files and directories use the
option -i. This security check is skipped entirely when the
-C option is given.</p>

<p>The security check can be retried at any time by running
the function compaudit. This is the same check used by
compinit, but when it is executed directly any changes to
fpath are made local to the function so they do not persist.
The directories to be checked may be passed as arguments; if
none are given, compaudit uses fpath and _compdir to find
completion system directories, adding missing ones to fpath
as neces- sary. To force a check of exactly the directories
currently named in fpath, set _compdir to an empty string
before calling compaudit or compinit.</p>

<p>The function bashcompinit compatibility with bash s
programmable com- pletion system. When run it will define
the functions, compgen and complete which correspond to the
bash builtins with the same names. It will then be possible
to use completion specifications and functions written for
bash.</p>

<p>Autoloaded files The convention for autoloaded functions
used in completion is that they start with an underscore; as
already mentioned, the fpath/FPATH parame- ter must contain
the directory in which they are stored. If zsh was properly
installed on your system, then fpath/FPATH automatically
con- tains the required directories for the standard
functions.</p>

<p>For incomplete installations, if compinit does not find
enough files beginning with an underscore (fewer than
twenty) in the search path, it will try to find more by
adding the directory _compdir to the search path. If that
directory has a subdirectory named Base, all subdirecto-
ries will be added to the path. Furthermore, if the
subdirectory Base has a subdirectory named Core, compinit
will add all subdirectories of the subdirectories is to the
path: this allows the functions to be in the same format as
in the zsh source distribution.</p>

<p>When compinit is run, it searches all such files
accessible via fpath/FPATH and reads the first line of each
of them. This line should contain one of the tags described
below. Files whose first line does not start with one of
these tags are not considered to be part of the completion
system and will not be treated specially.</p>

<p>The tags are:</p>

<p>#compdef names... [ -[pP] patterns... [ -N names... ] ]
The file will be made autoloadable and the function defined
in it will be called when completing names, each of which is
either the name of a command whose arguments are to be
completed or one of a number of special contexts in the form
-context- described below.</p>

<p>Each name may also be of the form cmd=service. When
complet- ing the command cmd, the function typically behaves
as if the command (or special context) service was being
completed instead. This provides a way of altering the
behaviour of func- tions that can perform many different
completions. It is imple- mented by setting the parameter
$service when calling the func- tion; the function may
choose to interpret this how it wishes, and simpler
functions will probably ignore it.</p>

<p>If the #compdef line contains one of the options -p or
-P, the words following are taken to be patterns. The
function will be called when completion is attempted for a
command or context that matches one of the patterns. The
options -p and -P are used to specify patterns to be tried
before or after other com- pletions respectively. Hence -P
may be used to specify default actions.</p>

<p>The option -N is used after a list following -p or -P;
it speci- fies that remaining words no longer define
patterns. It is pos- sible to toggle between the three
options as many times as nec- essary.</p>

<p>#compdef -k style key-sequences... This option creates a
widget behaving like the builtin widget style and binds it
to the given key-sequences, if any. The style must be one of
the builtin widgets that perform comple- tion, namely
complete-word, delete-char-or-list, expand-or-com- plete,
expand-or-complete-prefix, list-choices, menu-complete,
menu-expand-or-complete, or reverse-menu-complete. If the
zsh/complist module is loaded (see zshmodules(1)) the widget
menu-select is also available.</p>

<p>When one of the key-sequences is typed, the function in
the file will be invoked to generate the matches. Note that
a key will not be re-bound if if it already was (that is,
was bound to something other than undefined-key). The widget
created has the same name as the file and can be bound to
any other keys using bindkey as usual.</p>

<p>#compdef -K widget-name style key-sequences ... This is
similar to -k except that only one key-sequences argu- ment
may be given for each widget-name style pair. However, the
entire set of three arguments may be repeated with a
different set of arguments. Note in particular that the
widget-name must be distinct in each set. If it does not
begin with _ this will be added. The widget-name should not
clash with the name of any existing widget: names based on
the name of the function are most useful. For example,</p>

<p>#compdef -K _foo_complete complete-word &quot;^X^C&quot;
_foo_list list-choices &quot;^X^D&quot;</p>

<p>(all on one line) defines a widget _foo_complete for
completion, bound to ^X^C, and a widget _foo_list for
listing, bound to ^X^D.</p>

<p>#autoload [ options ] Functions with the #autoload tag
are marked for autoloading but are not otherwise treated
specially. Typically they are to be called from within one
of the completion functions. Any options supplied will be
passed to the autoload builtin; a typical use is +X to force
the function to be loaded immediately. Note that the -U and
-z flags are always added implicitly.</p>

<p>The # is part of the tag name and no white space is
allowed after it. The #compdef tags use the compdef function
described below; the main difference is that the name of the
function is supplied implicitly.</p>

<p>The special contexts for which completion functions can
be defined are:</p>

<p>-array-value- The right hand side of an array-assignment
( foo=(...))</p>

<p>-brace-parameter- The name of a parameter expansion
within braces ( ${...})</p>

<p>-assign-parameter- The name of a parameter in an
assignment, i.e. on the left hand side of an =</p>

<p>-command- A word in command position</p>

<p>-condition- A word inside a condition ([[...]])</p>

<p>-default- Any word for which no other completion is
defined</p>

<p>-equal- A word beginning with an equals sign</p>

<p>-first- This is tried before any other completion
function. The func- tion called may set the _compskip
parameter to one of various values: all: no further
completion is attempted; a string con- taining the substring
patterns: no pattern completion functions will be called; a
string containing default: the function for the -default-
context will not be called, but functions defined for
commands will</p>

<p>-math- Inside mathematical contexts, such as ((...))</p>

<p>-parameter- The name of a parameter expansion ($...)</p>

<p>-redirect- The word after a redirection operator.</p>

<p>-subscript- The contents of a parameter subscript.</p>

<p>-tilde- After an initial tilde (~), but before the first
slash in the word.</p>

<p>-value- On the right hand side of an assignment.</p>

<p>Default implementations are supplied for each of these
contexts. In most cases the context -context- is implemented
by a corresponding function _context, for example the
context -tilde- and the function _tilde).</p>

<p>The contexts -redirect- and -value- allow extra
context-specific infor- mation. (Internally, this is handled
by the functions for each context calling the function
_dispatch.) The extra information is added sepa- rated by
commas.</p>

<p>For the -redirect- context, the extra information is in
the form -redirect-,op,command , where op is the redirection
operator and com- mand is the name of the command on the
line. If there is no command on the line yet, the command
field will be empty.</p>

<p>For the -value- context, the form is
-value-,name,command, where name is the name of the
parameter. In the case of elements of an associa- tive
array, for example assoc=(key &lt;TAB&gt;, name is expanded
to name-key. In certain special contexts, such as completing
after make CFLAGS= , the command part gives the name of the
command, here make; otherwise it is empty.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to define fully specific completions
as the func- tions provided will try to generate completions
by progressively replacing the elements with -default-. For
example, when completing after foo=&lt;TAB&gt; , _value will
try the names -value-,foo, (note the empty command part),
-value-,foo,-default- and -value-,-default-,-default- , in
that order, until it finds a func- tion to handle the
context.</p>

<p>As an example:</p>

<p>compdef_files -g
&quot;*.log-redirect-,2&gt;,-default-</p>

<p>completes files matching *.log after 2&gt; &lt;TAB&gt;
for any command with no more specific handler defined.</p>

<p>Also:</p>

<p>compdef _foo -value-,-default-,-default-</p>

<p>specifies that _foo provides completions for the values
of parameters for which no special function has been
defined. This is usually han- dled by the function _value
itself.</p>

<p>The same lookup rules are used when looking up styles
(as described below); for example</p>

<p>zstyle :completion:*:*:-redirect-,2&gt;,*:*
file-patterns*.log</p>

<p>is another way to make completion after 2&gt;
&lt;TAB&gt; complete files matching *.log.</p>

<p>Functions The following function is defined by compinit
and may be called directly.</p>

<p>compdef [ -an ] function names... [ -[pP] patterns... [
-N names... ] ] compdef -d names... compdef -k [ -an ]
function style key-sequences... compdef -K [ -an ] function
name style key-sequences ... The first form defines the
function to call for completion in the given contexts as
described for the #compdef tag above.</p>

<p>Alternatively, all the arguments may have the form
cmd=ser- vice . Here service should already have been
defined by cmd1=service lines in #compdef files, as
described above. The argument for cmd will be completed in
the same way as service.</p>

<p>The function argument may alternatively be a string
containing any shell code. The string will be executed using
the eval builtin command to generate completions. This
provides a way of avoiding having to define a new completion
function. For exam- ple, to complete files ending in .h as
arguments to the com- mand foo:</p>

<p>compdef_files -g &quot;*.h&quot;foo</p>

<p>The option -n prevents any completions already defined
for the command or context from being overwritten.</p>

<p>The option -d deletes any completion defined for the
command or contexts listed.</p>

<p>The names may also contain -p, -P and -N options as
described for the #compdef tag. The effect on the argument
list is iden- tical, switching between definitions of
patterns tried ini- tially, patterns tried finally, and
normal commands and con- texts.</p>

<p>The parameter $_compskip may be set by any function
defined for a pattern context. If it is set to a value
containing the sub- string patterns none of the
pattern-functions will be called; if it is set to a value
containing the substring all, no other function will be
called.</p>

<p>The form with -k defines a widget with the same name as
the function that will be called for each of the
key-sequences; this is like the #compdef -k tag. The
function should generate the completions needed and will
otherwise behave like the builtin widget whose name is given
as the style argument. The widgets usable for this are:
complete-word, delete-char-or-list, expand-or-complete,
expand-or-complete-prefix, list-choices, menu-complete,
menu-expand-or-complete, and reverse-menu-com- plete, as
well as menu-select if the zsh/complist module is loaded.
The option -n prevents the key being bound if it is already
to bound to something other than undefined-key.</p>

<p>The form with -K is similar and defines multiple widgets
based on the same function, each of which requires the set
of three arguments name, style and key-sequences, where the
latter two are as for -k and the first must be a unique
widget name begin- ning with an underscore.</p>

<p>Wherever applicable, the -a option makes the function
autoload- able, equivalent to autoload -U function.</p>

<p>The function compdef can be used to associate existing
completion func- tions with new commands. For example,</p>

<p>compdef _pids foo</p>

<p>uses the function _pids to complete process IDs for the
command foo.</p>

<p>Note also the _gnu_generic function described below,
which can be used to complete options for commands that
understand the --help option.</p>

<p>COMPLETION SYSTEM CONFIGURATION This section gives a
short overview of how the completion system works, and then
more detail on how users can configure how and when matches
are generated.</p>

<p>Overview When completion is attempted somewhere on the
command line the comple- tion system first works out the
context. This takes account of a num- ber of things
including the command word (such as grep or zsh) and options
to which the current word may be an argument (such as the -o
option to zsh which takes a shell option as an
argument).</p>

<p>This context information is condensed into a string
consisting of mul- tiple fields separated by colons,
referred to simply as the context in the remainder of the
documentation. This is used to look up styles,
context-sensitive options that can be used to configure the
completion system. The context used for lookup may vary
during the same call to the completion system.</p>

<p>The context string always consists of a fixed set of
fields, separated by colons and with a leading colon before
the first, in the form :com-
pletion:function:completer:command:argument:tag. These have
the fol- lowing meaning:</p>

<p>&middot; The literal string completion, saying that this
style is used by the completion system. This distinguishes
the context from those used by, for example, zle widgets and
ZFTP functions.</p>

<p>&middot; The function, if completion is called from a
named widget rather than through the normal completion
system. Typically this is blank, but it is set by special
widgets such as predict-on and the various functions in the
Widget directory of the distribu- tion to the name of that
function, often in an abbreviated form.</p>

<p>&middot; The completer currently active, the name of the
function without the leading underscore and with other
underscores converted to hyphens. A completer is in overall
control of how completion is to be performed; complete is
the simplest, but other com- pleters exist to perform
related tasks such as correction, or to modify the behaviour
of a later completer. See the section Control Functions
below for more information.</p>

<p>&middot; The command or a special -context-, just at it
appears following the #compdef tag or the compdef function.
Completion functions for commands that have sub-commands
usually modify this field to contain the name of the command
followed by a minus sign and the sub-command. For example,
the completion function for the cvs command sets this field
to cvs-add when completing arguments to the add
subcommand.</p>

<p>&middot; The argument; this indicates which command line
or option argu- ment we are completing. For command
arguments this generally takes the form argument-n, where n
is the number of the argu- ment, and for arguments to
options the form option-opt-n where n is the number of the
argument to option opt. However, this is only the case if
the command line is parsed with standard UNIX-style options
and arguments, so many completions do not set this.</p>

<p>&middot; The tag. As described previously, tags are used
to discriminate between the types of matches a completion
function can generate in a certain context. Any completion
function may use any tag name it likes, but a list of the
more common ones is given below.</p>

<p>The context is gradually put together as the functions
are executed, starting with the main entry point, which adds
:completion: and the function element if necessary. The
completer then adds the completer element. The contextual
completion adds the command and argument options. Finally,
the tag is added when the types of completion are known. For
example, the context name</p>

<p>:completion::complete:dvips:option-o-1:files</p>

<p>says that normal completion was attempted as the first
argument to the option -o of the command dvips:</p>

<p>dvips -o ...</p>

<p>and the completion function will generate filenames.</p>

<p>Usually completion will be tried for all possible tags
in an order given by the completion function. However, this
can be altered by using the tag-order style. Completion is
then restricted to the list of given tags in the given
order.</p>

<p>The _complete_help bindable command shows all the
contexts and tags available for completion at a particular
point. This provides an easy way of finding information for
tag-order and other styles. It is described in the section
Bindable Commands below.</p>

<p>Styles determine such things as how the matches are
generated, simi- larly to shell options but with much more
control. They can have any number of strings as their value.
They are defined with the zstyle builtin command (see
zshmodules(1)).</p>

<p>When looking up styles the completion system uses full
context names, including the tag. Looking up the value of a
style therefore consists of two things: the context, which
may be matched as a pattern, and the name of the style
itself, which must be given exactly.</p>

<p>For example, many completion functions can generate
matches in a simple and a verbose form and use the verbose
style to decide which form should be used. To make all such
functions use the verbose form, put</p>

<p>zstyle:completion:*verbose yes</p>

<p>in a startup file (probably .zshrc). This gives the
verbose style the value yes in every context inside the
completion system, unless that context has a more specific
definition. It is best to avoid giving the context as * in
case the style has some meaning outside the comple- tion
system.</p>

<p>Many such general purpose styles can be configured
simply by using the compinstall function.</p>

<p>A more specific example of the use of the verbose style
is by the com- pletion for the kill builtin. If the style is
set, the builtin lists full job texts and process command
lines; otherwise it shows the bare job numbers and PIDs. To
turn the style off for this use only:</p>

<p>zstyle:completion:*:*:kill:*verbose no</p>

<p>For even more control, the style can use one of the tags
jobs or processes. To turn off verbose display only for
jobs:</p>

<p>zstyle:completion:*:*:kill:*:jobsverbose no</p>

<p>The -e option to zstyle even allows completion function
code to appear as the argument to a style; this requires
some understanding of the internals of completion functions
(see see zshcompwid(1))). For exam- ple,</p>

<p>zstyle -e:completion:*hostsreply=($myhosts)</p>

<p>This forces the value of the hosts style to be read from
the variable myhosts each time a host name is needed; this
is useful if the value of myhosts can change dynamically.
For another useful example, see the example in the
description of the file-list style below. This form can be
slow and should be avoided for commonly examined styles such
as menu and list-rows-first.</p>

<p>Note that the order in which styles are defined does not
matter; the style mechanism uses the most specific possible
match for a particular style to determine the set of values.
More precisely, strings are pre- ferred over patterns (for
example, :completion::complete:foo is more specific than
:completion::complete:), and longer patterns are pre- ferred
over shorter patterns.</p>

<p>Style names like those of tags are arbitrary and depend
on the comple- tion function. However, the following two
sections list some of the most common tags and styles.</p>

particular command name.</p>

<p>visuals for X visuals</p>

<p>warnings used to look up the format style for
warnings</p>

<p>widgets for zsh widget names</p>

<p>windows for IDs of X windows</p>

<p>Standard Styles Note that the values of several of these
styles represent boolean val- ues. Any of the strings true,
on, yes, and 1 can be used for the value true and any of the
strings false, off, no, and 0 for the value false. The
behavior for any other value is undefined except where
explicitly mentioned. The default value may be either true
or false if the style is not set.</p>

<p>Some of these styles are tested first for every possible
tag corre- sponding to a type of match, and if no style was
found, for the default tag. The most notable styles of this
type are menu, list-colors and styles controlling completion
listing such as list-packed and last-prompt). When tested
for the default tag, only the function field of the context
will be set so that a style using the default tag will
normally be defined along the lines of:</p>

<p>zstyle:completion:*:defaultmenu ...</p>

<p>accept-exact This is tested for the default tag in
addition to the tags valid for the current context. If it is
set to true and any of the trial matches is the same as the
string on the command line, this match will immediately be
accepted (even if it would other- wise be considered
ambiguous).</p>

<p>When completing pathnames (where the tag used is paths)
this style accepts any number of patterns as the value in
addition to the boolean values. Pathnames matching one of
these patterns will be accepted immediately even if the
command line contains some more partially typed pathname
components and these match no file under the directory
accepted.</p>

<p>This style is also used by the _expand completer to
decide if words beginning with a tilde or parameter
expansion should be expanded. For example, if there are
parameters foo and foobar, the string $foo will only be
expanded if accept-exact is set to true; otherwise the
completion system will be allowed to complete $foo to
$foobar. If the style is set to continue, _expand will add
the expansion as a match and the completion system will also
be allowed to continue.</p>

<p>accept-exact-dirs This is used by filename completion.
Unlike accept-exact it is a boolean. By default, filename
completion examines all compo- nents of a path to see if
there are completions of that compo- nent, even if the
component matches an existing directory. For example, when
completion after /usr/bin/, the function examines possible
completions to /usr.</p>

<p>When this style is true, any prefix of a path that
matches an existing directory is accepted without any
attempt to complete it further. Hence, in the given example,
the path /usr/bin/ is accepted immediately and completion
tried in that directory.</p>

<p>add-space This style is used by the _expand completer.
If it is true (the default), a space will be inserted after
all words resulting from the expansion, or a slash in the
case of directory names. If the value is file, the completer
will only add a space to names of existing files. Either a
boolean true or the value file may be combined with subst,
in which case the completer will not add a space to words
generated from the expansion of a substitution of the form
$(...) or ${...}.</p>

<p>The _prefix completer uses this style as a simple
boolean value to decide if a space should be inserted before
the suffix.</p>

<p>ambiguous This applies when completing non-final
components of filename paths, in other words those with a
trailing slash. If it is set, the cursor is left after the
first ambiguous component, even if menu completion is in
use. The style is always tested with the paths tag.</p>

<p>assign-list When completing after an equals sign that is
being treated as an assignment, the completion system
normally completes only one filename. In some cases the
value may be a list of filenames separated by colons, as
with PATH and similar parameters. This style can be set to a
list of patterns matching the names of such parameters.</p>

<p>The default is to complete lists when the word on the
line already contains a colon.</p>

<p>auto-description If set, this styles value will be used
as the description for options that are not described by the
completion functions, but that have exactly one argument.
The sequence %d in the value will be replaced by the
description for this argument. Depend- ing on personal
preferences, it may be useful to set this style to something
like specify: %d. Note that this may not work for some
commands.</p>

<p>avoid-completer This is used by the _all_matches
completer to decide if the string consisting of all matches
should be added to the list currently being generated. Its
value is a list of names of com- pleters. If any of these is
the name of the completer that gen- erated the matches in
this completion, the string will not be added.</p>

<p>The default value for this style is _expand _old_list
_correct _approximate, i.e. it contains the completers for
which a string with all matches will almost never be
wanted.</p>

<p>cache-path This style defines the path where any cache
files containing dumped completion data are stored. It
defaults to $ZDOT- DIR/.zcompcache , or $HOME/.zcompcache if
$ZDOTDIR is not defined. The completion cache will not be
used unless the use-cache style is set.</p>

<p>cache-policy This style defines the function that will
be used to determine whether a cache needs rebuilding. See
the section on the _cache_invalid function below.</p>

<p>call-command This style is used in the function for
commands such as make and ant where calling the command
directly to generate matches suf- fers problems such as
being slow or, as in the case of make can potentially causes
actions in the makefile to be executed. If it is set to true
the command is called to generate matches. The default value
of this style is false.</p>

<p>command In many places, completion functions need to
call external com- mands to generate the list of
completions. This style can be used to override the command
that is called in some such cases. The elements of the value
are joined with spaces to form a com- mand line to execute.
The value can also start with a hyphen, in which case the
usual command will be added to the end; this is most useful
for putting builtin or command in front to make sure the
appropriate version of a command is called, for example to
avoid calling a shell function with the same name as an
external command.</p>

<p>As an example, the completion function for process IDs
uses this style with the processes tag to generate the IDs
to complete and the list of processes to display (if the
verbose style is true ). The list produced by the command
should look like the output of the ps command. The first
line is not displayed, but is searched for the string PID
(or pid) to find the position of the process IDs in the
following lines. If the line does not contain PID, the first
numbers in each of the other lines are taken as the process
IDs to complete.</p>

<p>Note that the completion function generally has to call
the specified command for each attempt to generate the
completion list. Hence care should be taken to specify only
commands that take a short time to run, and in particular to
avoid any that may never terminate.</p>

<p>command-path This is a list of directories to search for
commands to com- plete. The default for this style is the
value of the special parameter path.</p>

<p>commands This is used by the function completing
sub-commands for the system initialisation scripts (residing
in /etc/init.d or some- where not too far away from that).
Its values give the default commands to complete for those
commands for which the completion function isnt able to find
them out automatically. The default for this style are the
two strings start and stop.</p>

<p>complete This is used by the _expand_alias function when
invoked as a bindable command. If it set to true and the
word on the com- mand line is not the name of an alias,
matching alias names will be completed.</p>

<p>complete-options This is used by the completer for cd,
chdir and pushd. For these commands a - is used to introduce
a directory stack entry and completion of these is far more
common than completing options. Hence unless the value of
this style is true options will not be completed, even after
an initial -. If it is true, options will be completed after
an initial - unless there is a preceding -- on the command
line.</p>

<p>completer The strings given as the value of this style
provide the names of the completer functions to use. The
available completer func- tions are described in the section
Control Functions below.</p>

<p>Each string may be either the name of a completer
function or a string of the form function:name. In the first
case the com- pleter field of the context will contain the
name of the com- pleter without the leading underscore and
with all other under- scores replaced by hyphens. In the
second case the function is the name of the completer to
call, but the context will contain the user-defined name in
the completer field of the context. If the name starts with
a hyphen, the string for the context will be build from the
name of the completer function as in the first case with the
name appended to it. For example:</p>

<p>zstyle :completion:* completer _complete
_complete:-foo</p>

<p>Here, completion will call the _complete completer
twice, once using complete and once using complete-foo in
the completer field of the context. Normally, using the same
completer more than once only makes sense when used with the
functions:name form, because otherwise the context name will
be the same in all calls to the completer; possible
exceptions to this rule are the _ignored and _prefix
completers.</p>

<p>The default value for this style is _complete _ignored:
only completion will be done, first using the
ignored-patterns style and the $fignore array and then
without ignoring matches.</p>

<p>condition This style is used by the _list completer
function to decide if insertion of matches should be delayed
unconditionally. The default is true.</p>

<p>delimiters This style is used when adding a delimiter
for use with history modifiers or glob qualifiers that have
delimited arguments. It is an array of preferred delimiters
to add. Non-special charac- ters are preferred as the
completion system may otherwise become confused. The default
list is :, +, /, -, %. The list may be empty to force a
delimiter to be typed.</p>

<p>disabled If this is set to true , the _expand_alias
completer and bind- able command will try to expand disabled
aliases, too. The default is false.</p>

<p>domains A list of names of network domains for
completion. If this is not set, domain names will be taken
from the file /etc/resolv.conf.</p>

<p>environ The environ style is used when completing for
sudo. It is set to an array of VAR=value assignments to be
exported into the local environment before the completion
for the target command is invoked. zstyle :complete:sudo:
environ PATH=&quot;/sbin:/usr/sbin:$PATH&quot;
HOME=&quot;/root&quot;</p>

<p>expand This style is used when completing strings
consisting of multi- ple parts, such as path names.</p>

<p>If one of its values is the string prefix, the partially
typed word from the line will be expanded as far as possible
even if trailing parts cannot be completed.</p>

<p>If one of its values is the string suffix, matching
names for components after the first ambiguous one will also
be added. This means that the resulting string is the
longest unambiguous string possible. However, menu
completion can be used to cycle through all matches.</p>

<p>fake This style may be set for any completion context.
It specifies additional strings that will always be
completed in that con- text. The form of each string is
value:description ; the colon and description may be
omitted, but any literal colons in value must be quoted with
a backslash. Any description provided is shown alongside the
value in completion listings.</p>

<p>It is important to use a sufficiently restrictive
context when specifying fake strings. Note that the styles
fake-files and fake-parameters provide additional features
when completing files or parameters.</p>

<p>fake-always This works identically to the fake style
except that the ignored-patterns style is not applied to it.
This makes it pos- sible to override a set of matches
completely by setting the ignored patterns to *.</p>

<p>The following shows a way of supplementing any tag with
arbi- trary data, but having it behave for display purposes
like a separate tag. In this example we use the features of
the tag-order style to divide the named-directories tag into
two when performing completion with the standard completer
complete for arguments of cd. The tag
named-directories-normal behaves as normal, but the tag
named-directories-mine contains a fixed set of directories.
This has the effect of adding the match group extra
directories with the given completions.</p>

<p>zstyle :completion::complete:cd:*tag-order
named-directories:-mine:extradirectories
named-directories:-normal:nameddirectories * zstyle
:completion::complete:cd:*:named-directories-mine
fake-always mydir1 mydir2 zstyle
:completion::complete:cd:*:named-directories-mine
ignored-patterns*</p>

<p>fake-files This style is used when completing files and
looked up without a tag. Its values are of the form
dir:names... . This will add the names (strings separated by
spaces) as possible matches when completing in the directory
dir, even if no such files really exist. The dir may be a
pattern; pattern characters or colons in dir should be quote
with a backslash to be treated literally.</p>

<p>This can be useful on systems that support special
filesystems whose top-level pathnames can not be listed or
generated with glob patterns. It can also be used for
directories for which one does not have read permission.</p>

<p>The pattern form can be used to add a certain magic
entry to all directories on a particular filing system.</p>

<p>fake-parameters This is used by the completion function
for parameter names. Its values are names of parameters that
might not yet be set but should be completed nonetheless.
Each name may also be followed by a colon and a string
specifying the type of the parameter (like scalar, array or
integer). If the type is given, the name will only be
completed if parameters of that type are required in the
particular context. Names for which no type is specified
will always be completed.</p>

<p>file-list This style controls whether files completed
using the standard builtin mechanism are to be listed with a
long list similar to ls -l. Note that this feature uses the
shell module zsh/stat for file information; this loads the
builtin stat which will replace any external stat
executable. To avoid this the follow- ing code can be
included in an initialization file:</p>

<p>zmodload -i zsh/stat disable stat</p>

<p>The style may either be set to a true value (or all ),
or one of the values insert or list, indicating that files
are to be listed in long format in all circumstances, or
when attempt- ing to insert a file name, or when listing
file names without attempting to insert one.</p>

<p>More generally, the value may be an array of any of the
above values, optionally followed by =num. If num is present
it gives the maximum number of matches for which long
listing style will be used. For example,</p>

<p>zstyle :completion:* file-list list=20 insert=10</p>

<p>specifies that long format will be used when listing up
to 20 files or inserting a file with up to 10 matches
(assuming a listing is to be shown at all, for example on an
ambiguous com- pletion), else short format will be used.</p>

<p>zstyle -e :completion:* file-list (( ${+NUMERIC} ))
&amp;&amp; reply=(true)</p>

<p>specifies that long format will be used any time a
numeric argu- ment is supplied, else short format.</p>

<p>file-patterns This is used by the standard function for
completing filenames, _files. If the style is unset up to
three tags are offered, globbed-files,directories and
all-files, depending on the types of files expected by the
caller of _files. The first two (globbed-files and
directories) are normally offered together to make it easier
to complete files in sub-directories.</p>

<p>The file-patterns style provides alternatives to the
default tags, which are not used. Its value consists of
elements of the form pattern:tag ; each string may contain
any number of such specifications separated by spaces.</p>

<p>The pattern is a pattern that is to be used to generate
file- names. Any occurrence of the sequence %p is replaced
by any pattern(s) passed by the function calling _files.
Colons in the pattern must be preceded by a backslash to
make them distin- guishable from the colon before the tag.
If more than one pat- tern is needed, the patterns can be
given inside braces, sepa- rated by commas.</p>

<p>The tags of all strings in the value will be offered by
_files and used when looking up other styles. Any tags in
the same word will be offered at the same time and before
later words. If no :tag is given the files tag will be
used.</p>

<p>The tag may also be followed by an optional second colon
and a description, which will be used for the %d in the
value of the format style (if that is set) instead of the
default description supplied by the completion function. If
the description given here contains itself a %d, that is
replaced with the descrip- tion supplied by the completion
function.</p>

<p>For example, to make the rm command first complete only
names of object files and then the names of all files if
there is no matching object file:</p>

<p>zstyle :completion:*:*:rm:* file-patterns
*.o:object-file%p:all-files</p>

<p>To alter the default behaviour of file completion --
offer files matching a pattern and directories on the first
attempt, then all files -- to offer only matching files on
the first attempt, then directories, and finally all
files:</p>

<p>zstyle :completion:* file-patterns
%p:globbed-file*(-/):directorie*:all-files</p>

<p>This works even where there is no special pattern:
_files matches all files using the pattern * at the first
step and stops when it sees this pattern. Note also it will
never try a pattern more than once for a single completion
attempt.</p>

<p>During the execution of completion functions, the
EXTENDED_GLOB option is in effect, so the characters #, ~
and ^ have special meanings in the patterns.</p>

<p>file-sort The standard filename completion function uses
this style with- out a tag to determine in which order the
names should be listed; menu completion will cycle through
them in the same order. The possible values are: size to
sort by the size of the file; links to sort by the number of
links to the file; modification (or time or date) to sort by
the last modifi- cation time; access to sort by the last
access time; and inode (or change) to sort by the last inode
change time. If the style is set to any other value, or is
unset, files will be sorted alphabetically by name. If the
value contains the string reverse, sorting is done in the
opposite order. If the value contains the string follow ,
timestamps are associated with the targets of symbolic
links; the default is to use the timestamps of the links
themselves.</p>

<p>filter This is used by the LDAP plugin for e-mail
address completion to specify the attributes to match
against when filtering entries. So for example, if the style
is set to sn , matching is done against surnames. Standard
LDAP filtering is used so normal completion matching is
bypassed. If this style is not set, the LDAP plugin is
skipped. You may also need to set the command style to
specify how to connect to your LDAP server.</p>

<p>force-list This forces a list of completions to be shown
at any point where listing is done, even in cases where the
list would usually be suppressed. For example, normally the
list is only shown if there are at least two different
matches. By setting this style to always, the list will
always be shown, even if there is only a single match that
will immediately be accepted. The style may also be set to a
number. In this case the list will be shown if there are at
least that many matches, even if they would all insert the
same string.</p>

<p>This style is tested for the default tag as well as for
each tag valid for the current completion. Hence the listing
can be forced only for certain types of match.</p>

<p>format If this is set for the descriptions tag, its
value is used as a string to display above matches in
completion lists. The sequence %d in this string will be
replaced with a short description of what these matches are.
This string may also contain the following sequences to
specify output attributes, as described in the section
EXPANSION OF PROMPT SEQUENCES in zsh- misc(1): %B , %S, %U,
%F, %K and their lower case coun- terparts, as well as
%{...%}. %F, %K and %{...%} take arguments in the same form
as prompt expansion. Note that the %G sequence is not
available; an argument to %{ should be used instead.</p>

<p>The style is tested with each tag valid for the current
comple- tion before it is tested for the descriptions tag.
Hence dif- ferent format strings can be defined for
different types of match.</p>

<p>Note also that some completer functions define
additional % -sequences. These are described for the
completer functions that make use of them.</p>

<p>Some completion functions display messages that may be
cus- tomised by setting this style for the messages tag.
Here, the %d is replaced with a message given by the
completion func- tion.</p>

<p>Finally, the format string is looked up with the
warnings tag, for use when no matches could be generated at
all. In this case the %d is replaced with the descriptions
for the matches that were expected separated by spaces. The
sequence %D is replaced with the same descriptions separated
by newlines.</p>

<p>It is possible to use printf-style field width
specifiers with %d and similar escape sequences. This is
handled by the zfor- mat builtin command from the zsh/zutil
module, see zshmod- ules(1).</p>

<p>glob This is used by the _expand completer. If it is set
to true (the default), globbing will be attempted on the
words resulting from a previous substitution (see the
substitute style) or else the original string from the
line.</p>

<p>global If this is set to true (the default), the
_expand_alias com- pleter and bindable command will try to
expand global aliases.</p>

<p>group-name The completion system can group different
types of matches, which appear in separate lists. This style
can be used to give the names of groups for particular tags.
For example, in com- mand position the completion system
generates names of builtin and external commands, names of
aliases, shell functions and parameters and reserved words
as possible completions. To have the external commands and
shell functions listed separately:</p>

<p>zstyle :completion:*:*:-command-:*:commands group-name
commands zstyle :completion:*:*:-command-:*:functions
group-name functions</p>

<p>As a consequence, any match with the same tag will be
displayed in the same group.</p>

<p>If the name given is the empty string the name of the
tag for the matches will be used as the name of the group.
So, to have all different types of matches displayed
separately, one can just set:</p>

<p>zstyle:completion:*group-name</p>

<p>All matches for which no group name is defined will be
put in a group named -default-.</p>

<p>group-order This style is additional to the group-name
style to specify the order for display of the groups defined
by that style (compare tag-order, which determines which
completions appear at all). The groups named are shown in
the given order; any other groups are shown in the order
defined by the completion function.</p>

<p>For example, to have names of builtin commands, shell
functions and external commands appear in that order when
completing in command position:</p>

<p>zstyle:completion:*:*:-command-:*group-order builtins
functions commands</p>

<p>groups A list of names of UNIX groups. If this is not
set, group names are taken from the YP database or the file
/etc/group.</p>

<p>hidden If this is set to true, matches for the given
context will not be listed, although any description for the
matches set with the format style will be shown. If it is
set to all , not even the description will be displayed.</p>

<p>Note that the matches will still be completed; they are
just not shown in the list. To avoid having matches
considered as possi- ble completions at all, the tag-order
style can be modified as described below.</p>

<p>hosts A list of names of hosts that should be completed.
If this is not set, hostnames are taken from the file
/etc/hosts.</p>

<p>hosts-ports This style is used by commands that need or
accept hostnames and network ports. The strings in the value
should be of the form host:port. Valid ports are determined
by the presence of hostnames; multiple ports for the same
host may appear.</p>

<p>ignore-line This is tested for each tag valid for the
current completion. If it is set to true, none of the words
that are already on the line will be considered as possible
completions. If it is set to current, the word the cursor is
on will not be consid- ered as a possible completion. The
value current-shown is similar but only applies if the list
of completions is currently shown on the screen. Finally, if
the style is set to other, no word apart from the current
one will be considered as a pos- sible completion.</p>

<p>The values current and current-shown are a bit like the
opposite of the accept-exact style: only strings with
missing characters will be completed.</p>

<p>Note that you almost certainly don t want to set this to
true or other for a general context such as :completion:*.
This is because it would disallow completion of, for
example, options multiple times even if the command in
question accepts the option more than once.</p>

<p>ignore-parents The style is tested without a tag by the
function completing pathnames in order to determine whether
to ignore the names of directories already mentioned in the
current word, or the name of the current working directory.
The value must include one or both of the following
strings:</p>

<p>parent The name of any directory whose path is already
contained in the word on the line is ignored. For example,
when completing after foo/../, the directory foo will not be
considered a valid completion.</p>

<p>pwd The name of the current working directory will not
be completed; hence, for example, completion after ../ will
not use the name of the current directory.</p>

<p>In addition, the value may include one or both of:</p>

<p>.. Ignore the specified directories only when the word
on the line contains the substring ../.</p>

<p>directory Ignore the specified directories only when
names of directories are completed, not when completing
names of files.</p>

<p>Excluded values act in a similar fashion to values of
the ignored-patterns style, so they can be restored to
consideration by the _ignored completer.</p>

<p>extra-verbose If set, the completion listing is more
verbose at the cost of a probable decrease in completion
speed. Completion performance will suffer if this style is
set to true.</p>

<p>ignored-patterns A list of patterns; any trial
completion matching one of the patterns will be excluded
from consideration. The _ignored com- pleter can appear in
the list of completers to restore the ignored matches. This
is a more configurable version of the shell parameter
$fignore.</p>

<p>Note that the EXTENDED_GLOB option is set during the
execution of completion functions, so the characters #, ~
and ^ have special meanings in the patterns.</p>

<p>insert This style is used by the _all_matches completer
to decide whether to insert the list of all matches
unconditionally instead of adding the list as another
match.</p>

<p>insert-ids When completing process IDs, for example as
arguments to the kill and wait builtins the name of a
command may be converted to the appropriate process ID. A
problem arises when the process name typed is not unique. By
default (or if this style is set explicitly to menu) the
name will be converted immediately to a set of possible IDs,
and menu completion will be started to cycle through
them.</p>

<p>If the value of the style is single, the shell will wait
until the user has typed enough to make the command unique
before con- verting the name to an ID; attempts at
completion will be unsuc- cessful until that point. If the
value is any other string, menu completion will be started
when the string typed by the user is longer than the common
prefix to the corresponding IDs.</p>

<p>insert-tab If this is set to true, the completion system
will insert a TAB character (assuming that was used to start
completion) instead of performing completion when there is
no non-blank character to the left of the cursor. If it is
set to false, completion will be done even there.</p>

<p>The value may also contain the substrings pending or
pend- ing=val. In this case, the typed character will be
inserted instead of staring completion when there is
unprocessed input pending. If a val is given, completion
will not be done if there are at least that many characters
of unprocessed input. This is often useful when pasting
characters into a terminal. Note however, that it relies on
the $PENDING special parameter from the zsh/zle module being
set properly which is not guaran- teed on all platforms.</p>

<p>The default value of this style is true except for
completion within vared builtin command where it is
false.</p>

<p>insert-unambiguous This is used by the _match and
_approximate completers. These completers are often used
with menu completion since the word typed may bear little
resemblance to the final completion. How- ever, if this
style is true, the completer will start menu completion only
if it could find no unambiguous initial string at least as
long as the original string typed by the user.</p>

<p>In the case of the _approximate completer, the completer
field in the context will already have been set to one of
correct-num or approximate-num, where num is the number of
errors that were accepted.</p>

<p>In the case of the _match completer, the style may also
be set to the string pattern. Then the pattern on the line
is left unchanged if it does not match unambiguously.</p>

<p>keep-prefix This style is used by the _expand completer.
If it is true, the completer will try to keep a prefix
containing a tilde or parameter expansion. Hence, for
example, the string ~/f* would be expanded to ~/foo instead
of /home/user/foo. If the style is set to changed (the
default), the prefix will only be left unchanged if there
were other changes between the expanded words and the
original word from the command line. Any other value forces
the prefix to be expanded unconditionally.</p>

<p>The behaviour of expand when this style is true is to
cause _expand to give up when a single expansion with the
restored prefix is the same as the original; hence any
remaining com- pleters may be called.</p>

<p>last-prompt This is a more flexible form of the
ALWAYS_LAST_PROMPT option. If it is true, the completion
system will try to return the cur- sor to the previous
command line after displaying a completion list. It is
tested for all tags valid for the current comple- tion, then
the default tag. The cursor will be moved back to the
previous line if this style is true for all types of match.
Note that unlike the ALWAYS_LAST_PROMPT option this is
independent of the numeric prefix argument.</p>

<p>known-hosts-files This style should contain a list of
files to search for host names and (if the use-ip style is
set) IP addresses in a format compatible with ssh
known_hosts files. If it is not set, the files
/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts and ~/.ssh/known_hosts are
used.</p>

<p>list This style is used by the _history_complete_word
bindable com- mand. If it is set to true it has no effect.
If it is set to false matches will not be listed. This
overrides the setting of the options controlling listing
behaviour, in particular AUTO_LIST. The context always
starts with :completion:his- tory-words.</p>

<p>list-colors If the zsh/complist module is loaded, this
style can be used to set color specifications. This
mechanism replaces the use of the ZLS_COLORS and ZLS_COLOURS
parameters described in the sec- tion The zsh/complist
Module in zshmodules(1), but the syntax is the same.</p>

<p>If this style is set for the default tag, the strings in
the value are taken as specifications that are to be used
every- where. If it is set for other tags, the
specifications are used only for matches of the type
described by the tag. For this to work best, the group-name
style must be set to an empty string.</p>

<p>In addition to setting styles for specific tags, it is
also possible to use group names specified explicitly by the
group-name tag together with the (group) syntax allowed by
the ZLS_COLORS and ZLS_COLOURS parameters and simply using
the default tag.</p>

<p>It is possible to use any color specifications already
set up for the GNU version of the ls command:</p>

<p>zstyle :completion:*:default list-colors
${(s.:.)LS_COLORS}</p>

<p>The default colors are the same as for the GNU ls
command and can be obtained by setting the style to an empty
string (i.e. ).</p>

<p>list-dirs-first This is used by file completion. If set,
directories to be com- pleted are listed separately from and
before completion for other files, regardless of tag
ordering. In addition, the tag other-files is used in place
of all-files for the remaining files, to indicate that no
directories are presented with that tag.</p>

<p>list-grouped If this style is true (the default), the
completion system will try to make certain completion
listings more compact by grouping matches. For example,
options for commands that have the same description (shown
when the verbose style is set to true) will appear as a
single entry. However, menu selection can be used to cycle
through all the matches.</p>

<p>list-packed This is tested for each tag valid in the
current context as well as the default tag. If it is set to
true, the corresponding matches appear in listings as if the
LIST_PACKED option were set. If it is set to false, they are
listed normally.</p>

<p>list-prompt If this style is set for the default tag,
completion lists that don t fit on the screen can be
scrolled (see the description of the zsh/complist module in
zshmodules(1)). The value, if not the empty string, will be
displayed after every screenful and the shell will prompt
for a key press; if the style is set to the empty string, a
default prompt will be used.</p>

<p>The value may contain the escape sequences: %l or %L,
which will be replaced by the number of the last line
displayed and the total number of lines; %m or %M, the
number of the last match shown and the total number of
matches; and %p and %P, Top when at the beginning of the
list, Bottom when at the end and the position shown as a
percentage of the total length otherwise. In each case the
form with the uppercase letter will be replaced by a string
of fixed width, padded to the right with spaces, while the
lowercase form will be replaced by a variable width string.
As in other prompt strings, the escape sequences %S , %s,
%B, %b, %U, %u for entering and leaving the display modes
standout, bold and underline, and %F , %f , %K, %k for
changing the foreground background colour, are also
available, as is the form %{...%} for enclos- ing escape
sequences which display with zero (or, with a numeric
argument, some other) width.</p>

<p>After deleting this prompt the variable LISTPROMPT
should be unset for the the removal to take effect.</p>

<p>list-rows-first This style is tested in the same way as
the list-packed style and determines whether matches are to
be listed in a rows-first fashion as if the LIST_ROWS_FIRST
option were set.</p>

<p>list-suffixes This style is used by the function that
completes filenames. If it is true, and completion is
attempted on a string containing multiple partially typed
pathname components, all ambiguous com- ponents will be
shown. Otherwise, completion stops at the first ambiguous
component.</p>

<p>list-separator The value of this style is used in
completion listing to sepa- rate the string to complete from
a description when possible (e.g. when completing options).
It defaults to -- (two hyphens).</p>

<p>local This is for use with functions that complete URLs
for which the corresponding files are available directly
from the filing sys- tem. Its value should consist of three
strings: a hostname, the path to the default web pages for
the server, and the directory name used by a user placing
web pages within their home area.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>zstyle :completion:* local toast /var/http/public/toast
public_html</p>

<p>Completion after http://toast/stuff/ will look for files
in the directory /var/http/public/toast/stuff, while
completion after http://toast/~yousir/ will look for files
in the direc- tory ~yousir/public_html.</p>

<p>mail-directory If set, zsh will assume that mailbox
files can be found in the directory specified. It defaults
to ~/Mail.</p>

<p>match-original This is used by the _match completer. If
it is set to only, _match will try to generate matches
without inserting a * at the cursor position. If set to any
other non-empty value, it will first try to generate matches
without inserting the * and if that yields no matches, it
will try again with the * inserted. If it is unset or set to
the empty string, matching will only be performed with the *
inserted.</p>

<p>matcher This style is tested separately for each tag
valid in the cur- rent context. Its value is added to any
match specifications given by the matcher-list style. It
should be in the form described in the section Completion
Matching Control in zsh- compwid(1).</p>

<p>matcher-list This style can be set to a list of match
specifications that are to be applied everywhere. Match
specifications are described in the section Completion
Matching Control in zshcompwid(1). The completion system
will try them one after another for each com- pleter
selected. For example, to try first simple completion and,
if that generates no matches, case-insensitive
completion:</p>

<p>zstyle :completion:* matcher-list
m:{a-zA-Z}={A-Za-z}</p>

<p>By default each specification replaces the previous one;
how- ever, if a specification is prefixed with +, it is
added to the existing list. Hence it is possible to create
increasingly gen- eral specifications without
repetition:</p>

<p>zstyle :completion:*matcher-lis+m{a-Z}={A-Z}
+m{A-Z}={a-z}</p>

<p>It is possible to create match specifications valid for
particu- lar completers by using the third field of the
context. For example, to use the completers _complete and
_prefix but only allow case-insensitive completion with
_complete:</p>

<p>zstyle :completion:* completer _complete _prefix
zstyle:completion:*:complete:* matcher-list
m:{a-zA-Z}={A-Za-z}</p>

<p>User-defined names, as explained for the completer
style, are available. This makes it possible to try the same
completer more than once with different match specifications
each time. For example, to try normal completion without a
match specifica- tion, then normal completion with
case-insensitive matching, then correction, and finally
partial-word completion:</p>

<p>zstyle :completion:* completer _complete _correct
_complete:foo zstyle:completion:*:complete:* matcher-list
m:{a-zA-Z}={A-Za-z} zstyle :completion:*:foo:* matcher-list
m:{a-zA-Z}={A-Za-z} r:|[-_./]=* r:|=*</p>

<p>If the style is unset in any context no match
specification is applied. Note also that some completers
such as _correct and _approximate do not use the match
specifications at all, though these completers will only
ever called once even if the matcher-list contains more than
one element.</p>

<p>Where multiple specifications are useful, note that the
entire completion is done for each element of matcher-list,
which can quickly reduce the shell s performance. As a rough
rule of thumb, one to three strings will give acceptable
performance. On the other hand, putting multiple
space-separated values into the same string does not have an
appreciable impact on perfor- mance.</p>

<p>If there is no current matcher or it is empty, and the
option NO_CASE_GLOB is in effect, the matching for files is
performed case-insensitively in any case. However, any
matcher must explicitly specify case-insensitive matching if
that is required.</p>

<p>max-errors This is used by the _approximate and _correct
completer func- tions to determine the maximum number of
errors to allow. The completer will try to generate
completions by first allowing one error, then two errors,
and so on, until either a match or matches were found or the
maximum number of errors given by this style has been
reached.</p>

<p>If the value for this style contains the string numeric,
the completer function will take any numeric argument as the
maximum number of errors allowed. For example, with</p>

<p>zstyle:completion:*:approximate:::max-errors 2
numeric</p>

<p>two errors are allowed if no numeric argument is given,
but with a numeric argument of six (as in ESC-6 TAB), up to
six errors are accepted. Hence with a value of 0 numeric, no
correcting completion will be attempted unless a numeric
argument is given.</p>

<p>If the value contains the string not-numeric , the
completer will not try to generate corrected completions
when given a numeric argument, so in this case the number
given should be greater than zero. For example, 2
not-numeric specifies that correcting completion with two
errors will usually be performed, but if a numeric argument
is given, correcting completion will not be performed.</p>

<p>The default value for this style is 2 numeric.</p>

<p>max-matches-width This style is used to determine the
trade off between the width of the display used for matches
and the width used for their descriptions when the verbose
style is in effect. The value gives the number of display
columns to reserve for the matches. The default is half the
width of the screen.</p>

<p>This has the most impact when several matches have the
same description and so will be grouped together. Increasing
the style will allow more matches to be grouped together;
decreasing it will allow more of the description to be
visible.</p>

<p>menu If this is true in the context of any of the tags
defined for the current completion menu completion will be
used. The value for a specific tag will take precedence over
that for the default tag.</p>

<p>If none of the values found in this way is true but at
least one is set to auto , the shell behaves as if the
AUTO_MENU option is set.</p>

<p>If one of the values is explicitly set to false, menu
completion will be explicitly turned off, overriding the
MENU_COMPLETE option and other settings.</p>

<p>In the form yes=num, where yes may be any of the true
values (yes, true, on and 1 ), menu completion will be
turned on if there are at least num matches. In the form
yes=long, menu completion will be turned on if the list does
not fit on the screen. This does not activate menu
completion if the widget normally only lists completions,
but menu completion can be activated in that case with the
value yes=long-list (Typi- cally, the value select=long-list
described later is more use- ful as it provides control over
scrolling.)</p>

<p>Similarly, with any of the false values (as in no=10),
menu completion will not be used if there are num or more
matches.</p>

<p>The value of this widget also controls menu selection,
as imple- mented by the zsh/complist module. The following
values may appear either alongside or instead of the values
above.</p>

<p>If the value contains the string select , menu selection
will be started unconditionally.</p>

<p>In the form select=num, menu selection will only be
started if there are at least num matches. If the values for
more than one tag provide a number, the smallest number is
taken.</p>

<p>Menu selection can be turned off explicitly by defining
a value containing the stringno-select.</p>

<p>It is also possible to start menu selection only if the
list of matches does not fit on the screen by using the
value select=long . To start menu selection even if the
current wid- get only performs listing, use the value
select=long-list.</p>

<p>To turn on menu completion or menu selection when a
there are a certain number of matches or the list of matches
does not fit on the screen, both of yes= and select= may be
given twice, once with a number and once with long or
long-list.</p>

<p>Finally, it is possible to activate two special modes of
menu selection. The word interactive in the value causes
interactive mode to be entered immediately when menu
selection is started; see the description of the
zsh/complist module in zshmodules(1) for a description of
interactive mode. Including the string search does the same
for incremental search mode. To select backward incremental
search, include the string search-backward.</p>

<p>muttrc If set, gives the location of the mutt
configuration file. It defaults to ~/.muttrc.</p>

<p>numbers This is used with the jobs tag. If it is true,
the shell will complete job numbers instead of the shortest
unambiguous prefix of the job command text. If the value is
a number, job numbers will only be used if that many words
from the job descriptions are required to resolve
ambiguities. For example, if the value is 1, strings will
only be used if all jobs differ in the first word on their
command lines.</p>

<p>old-list This is used by the _oldlist completer. If it
is set to always, then standard widgets which perform
listing will retain the current list of matches, however
they were generated; this can be turned off explicitly with
the value never, giving the behaviour without the _oldlist
completer. If the style is unset, or any other value, then
the existing list of completions is displayed if it is not
already; otherwise, the standard com- pletion list is
generated; this is the default behaviour of _oldlist.
However, if there is an old list and this style con- tains
the name of the completer function that generated the list,
then the old list will be used even if it was generated by a
widget which does not do listing.</p>

<p>For example, suppose you type ^Xc to use the
_correct_word wid- get, which generates a list of
corrections for the word under the cursor. Usually, typing
^D would generate a standard list of completions for the
word on the command line, and show that. With _oldlist, it
will instead show the list of corrections already
generated.</p>

<p>As another example consider the _match completer: with
the insert-unambiguous style set to true it inserts only a
common prefix string, if there is any. However, this may
remove parts of the original pattern, so that further
completion could pro- duce more matches than on the first
attempt. By using the _oldlist completer and setting this
style to _match, the list of matches generated on the first
attempt will be used again.</p>

<p>old-matches This is used by the _all_matches completer
to decide if an old list of matches should be used if one
exists. This is selected by one of the true values or by the
string only . If the value is only, _all_matches will only
use an old list and wont have any effect on the list of
matches currently being generated.</p>

<p>If this style is set it is generally unwise to call the
_all_matches completer unconditionally. One possible use is
for either this style or the completer style to be defined
with the -e option to zstyle to make the style
conditional.</p>

<p>old-menu This is used by the _oldlist completer. It
controls how menu completion behaves when a completion has
already been inserted and the user types a standard
completion key such as TAB. The default behaviour of
_oldlist is that menu completion always continues with the
existing list of completions. If this style is set to false,
however, a new completion is started if the old list was
generated by a different completion command; this is the
behaviour without the _oldlist completer.</p>

<p>For example, suppose you type ^Xc to generate a list of
correc- tions, and menu completion is started in one of the
usual ways. Usually, or with this style set to false, typing
TAB at this point would start trying to complete the line as
it now appears. With _oldlist, it instead continues to cycle
through the list of corrections.</p>

<p>original This is used by the _approximate and _correct
completers to decide if the original string should be added
as a possible com- pletion. Normally, this is done only if
there are at least two possible corrections, but if this
style is set to true, it is always added. Note that the
style will be examined with the completer field in the
context name set to correct-num or approximate-num, where
num is the number of errors that were accepted.</p>

<p>packageset This style is used when completing arguments
of the Debian dpkg program. It contains an override for the
default package set for a given context. For example,</p>

<p>zstyle :completion:*:complete:dpkg:option--status-1:*
packageset avail</p>

<p>causes available packages, rather than only installed
packages, to be completed for dpkg --status.</p>

<p>path The function that completes color names uses this
style with the colors tag. The value should be the pathname
of a file contain- ing color names in the format of an X11
rgb.txt file. If the style is not set but this file is found
in one of various stan- dard locations it will be used as
the default.</p>

<p>pine-directory If set, specifies the directory
containing PINE mailbox files. There is no default, since
recursively searching this directory is inconvenient for
anyone who doesnt use PINE.</p>

<p>ports A list of Internet service names (network ports)
to complete. If this is not set, service names are taken
from the file /etc/services.</p>

<p>prefix-hidden This is used for certain completions which
share a common pre- fix, for example command options
beginning with dashes. If it is true, the prefix will not be
shown in the list of matches.</p>

<p>The default value for this style is false.</p>

<p>prefix-needed This, too, is used for matches with a
common prefix. If it is set to true this common prefix must
be typed by the user to generate the matches. In the case of
command options, this means that the initial -, +, or --
must be typed explic- itly before option names will be
completed.</p>

<p>The default value for this style is true.</p>

<p>preserve-prefix This style is used when completing path
names. Its value should be a pattern matching an initial
prefix of the word to complete that should be left unchanged
under all circumstances. For example, on some Unices an
initial // (double slash) has a special meaning; setting
this style to the string // will pre- serve it. As another
example, setting this style to ?:/ under Cygwin would allow
completion after a:/... and so on.</p>

<p>range This is used by the _history completer and the
_history_com- plete_word bindable command to decide which
words should be com- pleted.</p>

<p>If it is a singe number, only the last N words from the
history will be completed.</p>

<p>If it is a range of the form max:slice , the last slice
words will be completed; then if that yields no matches, the
slice words before those will be tried and so on. This
process stops either when at least one match was been found,
or max words have been tried.</p>

<p>The default is to complete all words from the history at
once.</p>

<p>regular This style is used by the _expand_alias
completer and bindable command. If set to true (the
default), regular aliases will be expanded but only in
command position. If it is set to false, regular aliases
will never be expanded. If it is set to always, regular
aliases will be expanded even if not in command
position.</p>

<p>rehash If this is set when completing external commands,
the internal list (hash) of commands will be updated for
each search by issu- ing the rehash command. There is a
speed penalty for this which is only likely to be noticeable
when directories in the path have slow file access.</p>

<p>remote-access If set to false, certain commands will be
prevented from making Internet connections to retrieve
remote information. This includes the completion for the CVS
command.</p>

<p>It is not always possible to know if connections are in
fact to a remote site, so some may be prevented
unnecessarily.</p>

<p>remove-all-dups The _history_complete_word bindable
command and the _history completer use this to decide if all
duplicate matches should be removed, rather than just
consecutive duplicates.</p>

<p>select-prompt If this is set for the default tag, its
value will be displayed during menu selection (see the menu
style above) when the com- pletion list does not fit on the
screen as a whole. The same escapes as for the list-prompt
style are understood, except that the numbers refer to the
match or line the mark is on. A default prompt is used when
the value is the empty string.</p>

<p>select-scroll This style is tested for the default tag
and determines how a completion list is scrolled during a
menu selection (see the menu style above) when the
completion list does not fit on the screen as a whole. If
the value is 0 (zero), the list is scrolled by
half-screenfuls; if it is a positive integer, the list is
scrolled by the given number of lines; if it is a nega- tive
number, the list is scrolled by a screenful minus the abso-
lute value of the given number of lines. The default is to
scroll by single lines.</p>

<p>separate-sections This style is used with the manuals
tag when completing names of manual pages. If it is true ,
entries for different sections are added separately using
tag names of the form manual.X, where X is the section
number. When the group-name style is also in effect, pages
from different sections will appear sepa- rately. This style
is also used similarly with the words style when completing
words for the dict command. It allows words from different
dictionary databases to be added separately. The default for
this style is false.</p>

<p>show-completer Tested whenever a new completer is tried.
If it is true, the completion system outputs a progress
message in the listing area showing what completer is being
tried. The message will be overwritten by any output when
completions are found and is removed after completion is
finished.</p>

<p>single-ignored This is used by the _ignored completer
when there is only one match. If its value is show, the
single match will be dis- played but not inserted. If the
value is menu , then the sin- gle match and the original
string are both added as matches and menu completion is
started, making it easy to select either of them.</p>

<p>sort Many completion widgets call _description at some
point which decides whether the matches are added sorted or
unsorted (often indirectly via _wanted or _requested). This
style can be set explicitly to one of the usual true or
false values as an over- ride. If it is not set for the
context, the standard behaviour of the calling widget is
used.</p>

<p>The style is tested first against the full context
including the tag, and if that fails to produce a value
against the context without the tag.</p>

<p>If the calling widget explicitly requests unsorted
matches, this is usually honoured. However, the default
(unsorted) behaviour of completion for the command history
may be overridden by set- ting the style to true.</p>

<p>In the _expand completer, if it is set to true, the
expansions generated will always be sorted. If it is set to
menu, then the expansions are only sorted when they are
offered as single strings but not in the string containing
all possible expan- sions.</p>

<p>special-dirs Normally, the completion code will not
produce the directory names . and .. as possible
completions. If this style is set to true, it will add both
. and .. as possible comple- tions; if it is set to .., only
.. will be added.</p>

<p>The following example sets special-dirs to .. when the
current prefix is empty, is a single ., or consists only of
a path beginning with ../. Otherwise the value is false
.</p>

<p>zstyle -e :completion:* special-dirs [[ $PREFIX =
(../)#(|.|..) ]] &amp;&amp; reply=(..)</p>

<p>squeeze-slashes If set to true, sequences of slashes in
filename paths (for example in foo//bar) will be treated as
a single slash. This is the usual behaviour of UNIX paths.
However, by default the file completion function behaves as
if there were a * between the slashes.</p>

<p>stop If set to true , the _history_complete_word
bindable command will stop once when reaching the beginning
or end of the history. Invoking _history_complete_word will
then wrap around to the opposite end of the history. If this
style is set to false (the default), _history_complete_word
will loop immedi- ately as in a menu completion.</p>

<p>strip-comments If set to true, this style causes
non-essential comment text to be removed from completion
matches. Currently it is only used when completing e-mail
addresses where it removes any dis- play name from the
addresses, cutting them down to plain user@host form.</p>

<p>subst-globs-only This is used by the _expand completer.
If it is set to true, the expansion will only be used if it
resulted from globbing; hence, if expansions resulted from
the use of the substitute style described below, but these
were not further changed by globbing, the expansions will be
rejected.</p>

<p>The default for this style is false.</p>

<p>substitute This boolean style controls whether the
_expand completer will first try to expand all substitutions
in the string (such as $(...) and ${...}).</p>

<p>The default is true.</p>

<p>suffix This is used by the _expand completer if the word
starts with a tilde or contains a parameter expansion. If it
is set to true , the word will only be expanded if it doesnt
have a suf- fix, i.e. if it is something like ~foo or $foo
rather than ~foo/ or $foo/bar , unless that suffix itself
contains char- acters eligible for expansion. The default
for this style is true.</p>

<p>tag-order This provides a mechanism for sorting how the
tags available in a particular context will be used.</p>

<p>The values for the style are sets of space-separated
lists of tags. The tags in each value will be tried at the
same time; if no match is found, the next value is used.
(See the file-pat- terns style for an exception to this
behavior.)</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>zstyle :completion:*:complete:-command-:* tag-order
commands functions</p>

<p>specifies that completion in command position first
offers external commands and shell functions. Remaining tags
will be tried if no completions are found.</p>

<p>In addition to tag names, each string in the value may
take one of the following forms:</p>

<p>- If any value consists of only a hyphen, then only the
tags specified in the other values are generated. Nor- mally
all tags not explicitly selected are tried last if the
specified tags fail to generate any matches. This means that
a single value consisting only of a single hyphen turns off
completion.</p>

<p>! tags... A string starting with an exclamation mark
specifies names of tags that are not to be used. The effect
is the same as if all other possible tags for the context
had been listed.</p>

<p>tag:label ... Here, tag is one of the standard tags and
label is an arbitrary name. Matches are generated as normal
but the name label is used in contexts instead of tag. This
is not useful in words starting with !.</p>

<p>If the label starts with a hyphen, the tag is prepended
to the label to form the name used for lookup. This can be
used to make the completion system try a certain tag more
than once, supplying different style settings for each
attempt; see below for an example.</p>

<p>tag:label:description As before, but description will
replace the %d in the value of the format style instead of
the default descrip- tion supplied by the completion
function. Spaces in the description must be quoted with a
backslash. A %d appearing in description is replaced with
the description given by the completion function.</p>

<p>In any of the forms above the tag may be a pattern or
several patterns in the form {pat1,pat2...}. In this case
all match- ing tags will be used except for any given
explicitly in the same string.</p>

<p>One use of these features is to try one tag more than
once, set- ting other styles differently on each attempt,
but still to use all the other tags without having to repeat
them all. For exam- ple, to make completion of function
names in command position ignore all the completion
functions starting with an underscore the first time
completion is tried:</p>

<p>zstyle :completion:*:*:-command-:*tag-order
functions:-non-comp *functions zstyle
:completion:*:functions-non-comp ignored-patterns_*</p>

<p>On the first attempt, all tags will be offered but the
functions tag will be replaced by functions-non-comp. The
ignored-pat- terns style is set for this tag to exclude
functions starting with an underscore. If there are no
matches, the second value of the tag-order style is used
which completes functions using the default tag, this time
presumably including all function names.</p>

<p>The matches for one tag can be split into different
groups. For example:</p>

<p>zstyle :completion:* tag-order options:-long:longoptions
options:-short:shortoptions
options:-single-letter:singleletteroptions</p>

<p>zstyle :completion:*:options-long ignored-patterns
[-+](|-|[^-]*) zstyle :completion:*:options-short
ignored-patterns --* [-+]? zstyle
:completion:*:options-single-letter ignored-patterns
???*</p>

<p>With the group-names style set, options beginning with
--, options beginning with a single - or + but containing
multi- ple characters, and single-letter options will be
displayed in separate groups with different
descriptions.</p>

<p>Another use of patterns is to try multiple match
specifications one after another. The matcher-list style
offers something sim- ilar, but it is tested very early in
the completion system and hence can t be set for single
commands nor for more specific contexts. Here is how to try
normal completion without any match specification and, if
that generates no matches, try again with case-insensitive
matching, restricting the effect to argu- ments of the
command foo:</p>

<p>zstyle:completion:*:*:foo:*tag-order*:-case
zstyle:completion:*-casematcherm:{a-z}={A-Z}</p>

<p>First, all the tags offered when completing after foo
are tried using the normal tag name. If that generates no
matches, the second value of tag-order is used, which tries
all tags again except that this time each has -case appended
to its name for lookup of styles. Hence this time the value
for the matcher style from the second call to zstyle in the
example is used to make completion case-insensitive.</p>

<p>It is possible to use the -e option of the zstyle
builtin com- mand to specify conditions for the use of
particular tags. For example:</p>

<p>zstyle -e*:-command-:*tag-order if [[ -n $PREFIX$SUFFIX
]]; then reply=( ) else reply=( - ) fi</p>

<p>Completion in command position will be attempted only if
the string typed so far is not empty. This is tested using
the PRE- FIX special parameter; see zshcompwid for a
description of parameters which are special inside
completion widgets. Setting reply to an empty array provides
the default behaviour of trying all tags at once; setting it
to an array containing only a hyphen disables the use of all
tags and hence of all comple- tions.</p>

<p>If no tag-order style has been defined for a context,
the strings (|*-)argument-* (|*-)option-* values and options
plus all tags offered by the completion function will be
used to provide a sensible default behavior that causes
arguments (whether normal command arguments or arguments of
options) to be completed before option names for most
commands.</p>

<p>urls This is used together with the the urls tag by
functions com- pleting URLs.</p>

<p>If the value consists of more than one string, or if the
only string does not name a file or directory, the strings
are used as the URLs to complete.</p>

<p>If the value contains only one string which is the name
of a normal file the URLs are taken from that file (where
the URLs may be separated by white space or newlines).</p>

<p>Finally, if the only string in the value names a
directory, the directory hierarchy rooted at this directory
gives the comple- tions. The top level directory should be
the file access method, such as http, ftp, bookmark and so
on. In many cases the next level of directories will be a
filename. The directory hierarchy can descend as deep as
necessary.</p>

<p>For example,</p>

<p>zstyle:completion:*urls ~/.urls mkdir -p
~/.urls/ftp/ftp.zsh.org/pub/development</p>

<p>allows completion of all the components of the URL
ftp://ftp.zsh.org/pub/development after suitable commands
such as netscape or lynx. Note, however, that access methods
and files are completed separately, so if the hosts style is
set hosts can be completed without reference to the urls
style.</p>

<p>See the description in the function _urls itself for
more infor- mation (e.g. more $^fpath/_urls(N)).</p>

<p>use-cache If this is set, the completion caching layer
is activated for any completions which use it (via the
_store_cache, _retrieve_cache, and _cache_invalid
functions). The directory containing the cache files can be
changed with the cache-path style.</p>

<p>use-compctl If this style is set to a string not equal
to false, 0, no, and off, the completion system may use any
completion specifications defined with the compctl builtin
command. If the style is unset, this is done only if the
zsh/compctl module is loaded. The string may also contain
the substring first to use comple- tions defined with
compctl -T, and the substring default to use the completion
defined with compctl -D.</p>

<p>Note that this is only intended to smooth the transition
from compctl to the new completion system and may disappear
in the future.</p>

<p>Note also that the definitions from compctl will only be
used if there is no specific completion function for the
command in question. For example, if there is a function
_foo to complete arguments to the command foo, compctl will
never be invoked for foo. However, the compctl version will
be tried if foo only uses default completion.</p>

<p>use-ip By default, the function _hosts that completes
host names strips IP addresses from entries read from host
databases such as NIS and ssh files. If this style is true,
the corresponding IP addresses can be completed as well.
This style is not use in any context where the hosts style
is set; note also it must be set before the cache of host
names is generated (typically the first completion
attempt).</p>

<p>use-perl Various parts of the function system use awk to
extract words from files or command output as this
universally available. However, many versions of awk have
arbitrary limits on the size of input. If this style is set,
perl will be used instead. This is almost always preferable
if perl is available on your system.</p>

<p>Currently this is only used in completions for make, but
it may be extended depending on authorial frustration.</p>

<p>users This may be set to a list of usernames to be
completed. If it is not set all usernames will be completed.
Note that if it is set only that list of users will be
completed; this is because on some systems querying all
users can take a prohibitive amount of time.</p>

<p>users-hosts The values of this style should be of the
form user@host or user:host. It is used for commands that
need pairs of user- and hostnames. These commands will
complete usernames from this style (only), and will restrict
subsequent hostname completion to hosts paired with that
user in one of the values of the style.</p>

<p>It is possible to group values for sets of commands
which allow a remote login, such as rlogin and ssh, by using
the my-accounts tag. Similarly, values for sets of commands
which usually refer to the accounts of other people, such as
talk and finger, can be grouped by using the other-accounts
tag. More ambivalent com- mands may use the accounts
tag.</p>

<p>users-hosts-ports Like users-hosts but used for commands
like telnet and contain- ing strings of the form
user@host:port.</p>

<p>verbose If set, as it is by default, the completion
listing is more ver- bose. In particular many commands show
descriptions for options if this style is true.</p>

<p>word This is used by the _list completer, which prevents
the inser- tion of completions until a second completion
attempt when the line has not changed. The normal way of
finding out if the line has changed is to compare its entire
contents between the two occasions. If this style is true,
the comparison is instead performed only on the current
word. Hence if completion is per- formed on another word
with the same contents, completion will not be delayed.</p>

<p>CONTROL FUNCTIONS The initialization script compinit
redefines all the widgets which per- form completion to call
the supplied widget function _main_complete. This function
acts as a wrapper calling the so-called completer func-
tions that generate matches. If _main_complete is called
with argu- ments, these are taken as the names of completer
functions to be called in the order given. If no arguments
are given, the set of functions to try is taken from the
completer style. For example, to use normal com- pletion and
correction if that doesn t generate any matches:</p>

<p>zstyle:completion:*completer _complete _correct</p>

<p>after calling compinit. The default value for this style
is _complete _ignored, i.e. normally only ordinary
completion is tried, first with the effect of the
ignored-patterns style and then without it. The
_main_complete function uses the return status of the
completer func- tions to decide if other completers should
be called. If the return status is zero, no other completers
are tried and the _main_complete function returns.</p>

<p>If the first argument to _main_complete is a single
hyphen, the argu- ments will not be taken as names of
completers. Instead, the second argument gives a name to use
in the completer field of the context and the other
arguments give a command name and arguments to call to
gener- ate the matches.</p>

<p>The following completer functions are contained in the
distribution, although users may write their own. Note that
in contexts the leading underscore is stripped, for example
basic completion is performed in the context
:completion::complete:....</p>

<p>_all_matches This completer can be used to add a string
consisting of all other matches. As it influences later
completers it must appear as the first completer in the
list. The list of all matches is affected by the
avoid-completer and old-matches styles described above.</p>

<p>It may be useful to use the _generic function described
below to bind _all_matches to its own keystroke, for
example:</p>

<p>zle -C all-matches complete-word _generic
bindkey^Xaall-matches zstyle:completion:all-matches:*
old-matches only zstyle :completion:all-matches::::completer
_all_matches</p>

<p>Note that this does not generate completions by itself:
first use any of the standard ways of generating a list of
comple- tions, then use ^Xa to show all matches. It is
possible instead to add a standard completer to the list and
request that the list of all matches should be directly
inserted:</p>

<p>zstyle:completion:all-matches:::: completer _all_matches
_complete zstyle:completion:all-matches:*insert true</p>

<p>In this case the old-matches style should not be
set.</p>

<p>_approximate This is similar to the basic _complete
completer but allows the completions to undergo corrections.
The maximum number of errors can be specified by the
max-errors style; see the description of approximate
matching in zshexpn(1) for how errors are counted. Normally
this completer will only be tried after the normal _complete
completer:</p>

<p>zstyle :completion:* completer _complete
_approximate</p>

<p>This will give correcting completion if and only if
normal com- pletion yields no possible completions. When
corrected comple- tions are found, the completer will
normally start menu comple- tion allowing you to cycle
through these strings.</p>

<p>This completer uses the tags corrections and original
when gen- erating the possible corrections and the original
string. The format style for the former may contain the
additional sequences %e and %o which will be replaced by the
number of errors accepted to generate the corrections and
the original string, respectively.</p>

<p>The completer progressively increases the number of
errors allowed up to the limit by the max-errors style,
hence if a com- pletion is found with one error, no
completions with two errors will be shown, and so on. It
modifies the completer name in the context to indicate the
number of errors being tried: on the first try the completer
field contains approximate-1, on the second try
approximate-2, and so on.</p>

<p>When _approximate is called from another function, the
number of errors to accept may be passed with the -a option.
The argument is in the same format as the max-errors style,
all in one string.</p>

<p>Note that this completer (and the _correct completer
mentioned below) can be quite expensive to call, especially
when a large number of errors are allowed. One way to avoid
this is to set up the completer style using the -e option to
zstyle so that some completers are only used when completion
is attempted a second time on the same string, e.g.:</p>

<p>zstyle -e:completion:*completer if [[ $_last_try !=
&quot;$HISTNO$BUFFER$CURSOR&quot; ]]; then
_last_try=&quot;$HISTNO$BUFFER$CURSOR&quot; reply=(_complete
_match _prefix) else reply=(_ignored _correct _approximate)
fi</p>

<p>This uses the HISTNO parameter and the BUFFER and CURSOR
special parameters that are available inside zle and
completion widgets to find out if the command line hasnt
changed since the last time completion was tried. Only then
are the _ignored, _correct and _approximate completers
called.</p>

<p>_complete This completer generates all possible
completions in a con- text-sensitive manner, i.e. using the
settings defined with the compdef function explained above
and the current settings of all special parameters. This
gives the normal completion behaviour.</p>

<p>To complete arguments of commands, _complete uses the
utility function _normal, which is in turn responsible for
finding the particular function; it is described below.
Various contexts of the form -context- are handled
specifically. These are all men- tioned above as possible
arguments to the #compdef tag.</p>

<p>Before trying to find a function for a specific context,
_com- plete checks if the parameter compcontext is set.
Setting compcontext allows the usual completion dispatching
to be overridden which is useful in places such as a
function that uses vared for input. If it is set to an
array, the elements are taken to be the possible matches
which will be completed using the tag values and the
description value. If it is set to an associative array, the
keys are used as the possible completions and the values (if
non-empty) are used as descriptions for the matches. If
compcontext is set to a string containing colons, it should
be of the form tag:descr:action. In this case the tag and
descr give the tag and description to use and the action
indicates what should be completed in one of the forms
accepted by the _arguments utility function described
below.</p>

<p>Finally, if compcontext is set to a string without
colons, the value is taken as the name of the context to use
and the func- tion defined for that context will be called.
For this purpose, there is a special context named
-command-line- that completes whole command lines (commands
and their arguments). This is not used by the completion
system itself but is nonetheless handled when explicitly
called.</p>

<p>_correct Generate corrections, but not completions, for
the current word; this is similar to _approximate but will
not allow any number of extra characters at the cursor as
that completer does. The effect is similar to
spell-checking. It is based on _approxi- mate, but the
completer field in the context name is correct.</p>

<p>For example, with:</p>

<p>zstyle :completion:::::completer _complete _correct
_approximate zstyle:completion:*:correct::: max-errors 2
not-numeric zstyle:completion:*:approximate:::max-errors 3
numeric</p>

<p>correction will accept up to two errors. If a numeric
argument is given, correction will not be performed, but
correcting com- pletion will be, and will accept as many
errors as given by the numeric argument. Without a numeric
argument, first correction and then correcting completion
will be tried, with the first one accepting two errors and
the second one accepting three errors.</p>

<p>When _correct is called as a function, the number of
errors to accept may be given following the -a option. The
argument is in the same form a values to the accept style,
all in one string.</p>

<p>This completer function is intended to be used without
the _approximate completer or, as in the example, just
before it. Using it after the _approximate completer is
useless since _approximate will at least generate the
corrected strings gener- ated by the _correct completer --
and probably more.</p>

<p>_expand This completer function does not really perform
completion, but instead checks if the word on the command
line is eligible for expansion and, if it is, gives detailed
control over how this expansion is done. For this to happen,
the completion system needs to be invoked with
complete-word, not expand-or-complete (the default binding
for TAB), as otherwise the string will be expanded by the
shells internal mechanism before the completion system is
started. Note also this completer should be called before
the _complete completer function.</p>

<p>The tags used when generating expansions are
all-expansions for the string containing all possible
expansions, expansions when adding the possible expansions
as single matches and original when adding the original
string from the line. The order in which these strings are
generated, if at all, can be controlled by the group-order
and tag-order styles, as usual.</p>

<p>The format string for all-expansions and for expansions
may con- tain the sequence %o which will be replaced by the
original string from the line.</p>

<p>The kind of expansion to be tried is controlled by the
substi- tute, glob and subst-globs-only styles.</p>

<p>It is also possible to call _expand as a function, in
which case the different modes may be selected with options:
-s for substi- tute, -g for glob and -o for
subst-globs-only.</p>

<p>_expand_alias If the word the cursor is on is an alias,
it is expanded and no other completers are called. The types
of aliases which are to be expanded can be controlled with
the styles regular, global and disabled.</p>

<p>This function is also a bindable command, see the
section Bind- able Commands below.</p>

<p>_history Complete words from the shell s command
history. This com- pleter can be controlled by the
remove-all-dups, and sort styles as for the
_history_complete_word bindable command, see the sec- tion
Bindable Commands below and the section Completion Sys- tem
Configuration above.</p>

<p>_ignored The ignored-patterns style can be set to a list
of patterns which are compared against possible completions;
matching ones are removed. With this completer those matches
can be rein- stated, as if no ignored-patterns style were
set. The completer actually generates its own list of
matches; which completers are invoked is determined in the
same way as for the _prefix com- pleter. The single-ignored
style is also available as described above.</p>

<p>_list This completer allows the insertion of matches to
be delayed until completion is attempted a second time
without the word on the line being changed. On the first
attempt, only the list of matches will be shown. It is
affected by the styles condition and word, see the section
Completion System Configuration above.</p>

<p>_match This completer is intended to be used after the
_complete com- pleter. It behaves similarly but the string
on the command line may be a pattern to match against trial
completions. This gives the effect of the GLOB_COMPLETE
option.</p>

<p>Normally completion will be performed by taking the
pattern from the line, inserting a * at the cursor position
and comparing the resulting pattern with the possible
completions generated. This can be modified with the
match-original style described above.</p>

<p>The generated matches will be offered in a menu
completion unless the insert-unambiguous style is set to
true; see the description above for other options for this
style.</p>

<p>Note that matcher specifications defined globally or
used by the completion functions (the styles matcher-list
and matcher) will not be used.</p>

<p>_menu This completer was written as simple example
function to show how menu completion can be enabled in shell
code. However, it has the notable effect of disabling menu
selection which can be useful with _generic based widgets.
It should be used as the first completer in the list. Note
that this is independent of the setting of the MENU_COMPLETE
option and does not work with the other menu completion
widgets such as reverse-menu-complete, or
accept-and-menu-complete.</p>

<p>_oldlist This completer controls how the standard
completion widgets behave when there is an existing list of
completions which may have been generated by a special
completion (i.e. a sepa- rately-bound completion command).
It allows the ordinary com- pletion keys to continue to use
the list of completions thus generated, instead of producing
a new list of ordinary contex- tual completions. It should
appear in the list of completers before any of the widgets
which generate matches. It uses two styles: old-list and
old-menu, see the section Completion Sys- tem Configuration
above.</p>

<p>_prefix This completer can be used to try completion
with the suffix (everything after the cursor) ignored. In
other words, the suf- fix will not be considered to be part
of the word to complete. The effect is similar to the
expand-or-complete-prefix command.</p>

<p>The completer style is used to decide which other
completers are to be called to generate matches. If this
style is unset, the list of completers set for the current
context is used -- except, of course, the _prefix completer
itself. Furthermore, if this completer appears more than
once in the list of com- pleters only those completers not
already tried by the last invocation of _prefix will be
called.</p>

<p>For example, consider this global completer style:</p>

<p>zstyle :completion:* completer _complete _prefix
_correct _prefix:foo</p>

<p>Here, the _prefix completer tries normal completion but
ignoring the suffix. If that doesnt generate any matches,
and neither does the call to the _correct completer after
it, _prefix will be called a second time and, now only
trying correction with the suffix ignored. On the second
invocation the completer part of the context appears as
foo.</p>

<p>To use _prefix as the last resort and try only normal
completion when it is invoked:</p>

<p>zstyle:completion:*completer _complete ... _prefix
zstyle :completion::prefix:* completer _complete</p>

<p>The add-space style is also respected. If it is set to
true then _prefix will insert a space between the matches
generated (if any) and the suffix.</p>

<p>Note that this completer is only useful if the
COMPLETE_IN_WORD option is set; otherwise, the cursor will
be moved to the end of the current word before the
completion code is called and hence there will be no
suffix.</p>

<p>_user_expand This completer behaves similarly to the
_expand completer but instead performs expansions defined by
users. The styles add-space and sort styles specific to the
_expand completer are usable with _user_expand in addition
to other styles handled more generally by the completion
system. The tag all-expansions is also available.</p>

<p>The expansion depends on the array style user-expand
being defined for the current context; remember that the
context for completers is less specific than that for
contextual completion as the full context has not yet been
determined. Elements of the array may have one of the
following forms: $hash hash is the name of an associative
array. Note this is not a full parameter expression, merely
a $, suitably quoted to prevent immediate expansion,
followed by the name of an associative array. If the trial
expansion word matches a key in hash, the resulting
expansion is the corresponding value. _func _func is the
name of a shell function whose name must begin with _ but is
not otherwise special to the comple- tion system. The
function is called with the trial word as an argument. If
the word is to be expanded, the func- tion should set the
array reply to a list of expansions. The return status of
the function is irrelevant.</p>

<p>BINDABLE COMMANDS In addition to the context-dependent
completions provided, which are expected to work in an
intuitively obvious way, there are a few widgets
implementing special behaviour which can be bound separately
to keys. The following is a list of these and their default
bindings.</p>

<p>_bash_completions This function is used by two widgets,
_bash_complete-word and _bash_list-choices. It exists to
provide compatibility with completion bindings in bash. The
last character of the binding determines what is completed:
!, command names; $ , environ- ment variables; @, host
names; /, file names; ~ user names. In bash, the binding
preceded by e gives completion, and preceded by ^X lists
options. As some of these bindings clash with standard zsh
bindings, onlye~ and ^X~ are bound by default. To add the
rest, the following should be added to .zshrc after compinit
has been run:</p>

<p>for key in; do bindkey e$key&quot; _bash_complete-word
bindkey &quot;^X$key&quot; _bash_list-choices done</p>

<p>This includes the bindings for ~ in case they were
already bound to something else; the completion code does
not override user bindings.</p>

<p>_correct_filename (^XC) Correct the filename path at the
cursor position. Allows up to six errors in the name. Can
also be called with an argument to correct a filename path,
independently of zle; the correction is printed on standard
output.</p>

<p>_correct_word (^Xc) Performs correction of the current
argument using the usual con- textual completions as
possible choices. This stores the string correct-word in the
function field of the context name and then calls the
_correct completer.</p>

<p>_expand_alias (^Xa) This function can be used as a
completer and as a bindable com- mand. It expands the word
the cursor is on if it is an alias. The types of alias
expanded can be controlled with the styles regular, global
and disabled.</p>

<p>When used as a bindable command there is one additional
feature that can be selected by setting the complete style
to true. In this case, if the word is not the name of an
alias, _expand_alias tries to complete the word to a full
alias name without expanding it. It leaves the cursor
directly after the completed word so that invoking
_expand_alias once more will expand the now-complete alias
name.</p>

<p>_expand_word (^Xe) Performs expansion on the current
word: equivalent to the stan- dard expand-word command, but
using the _expand completer. Before calling it, the function
field of the context is set to expand-word.</p>

<p>_generic This function is not defined as a widget and
not bound by default. However, it can be used to define a
widget and will then store the name of the widget in the
function field of the context and call the completion
system. This allows custom com- pletion widgets with their
own set of style settings to be defined easily. For example,
to define a widget that performs normal completion and
starts menu selection:</p>

<p>zle -C foo complete-word _generic bindkey...foo
zstyle:completion:foo:*menu yes select=1</p>

<p>Note in particular that the completer style may be set
for the context in order to change the set of functions used
to generate possible matches. If _generic is called with
arguments, those are passed through to _main_complete as the
list of completers in place of those defined by the
completer style.</p>

<p>_history_complete_word (\/) Complete words from the
shell s command history. This uses the list,
remove-all-dups, sort, and stop styles.</p>

<p>_most_recent_file (^Xm) Complete the name of the most
recently modified file matching the pattern on the command
line (which may be blank). If given a numeric argument N,
complete the Nth most recently modified file. Note the
completion, if any, is always unique.</p>

<p>_next_tags (^Xn) This command alters the set of matches
used to that for the next tag, or set of tags, either as
given by the tag-order style or as set by default; these
matches would otherwise not be avail- able. Successive
invocations of the command cycle through all possible sets
of tags.</p>

<p>_read_comp (^X^R) Prompt the user for a string, and use
that to perform completion on the current word. There are
two possibilities for the string. First, it can be a set of
words beginning _, for example _files -/, in which case the
function with any argu- ments will be called to generate the
completions. Unambiguous parts of the function name will be
completed automatically (nor- mal completion is not
available at this point) until a space is typed.</p>

<p>Second, any other string will be passed as a set of
arguments to compadd and should hence be an expression
specifying what should be completed.</p>

<p>A very restricted set of editing commands is available
when reading the string: DEL and ^H delete the last
character; ^U deletes the line, and ^C and ^G abort the
function, while RET accepts the completion. Note the string
is used verbatim as a command line, so arguments must be
quoted in accordance with standard shell rules.</p>

<p>Once a string has been read, the next call to _read_comp
will use the existing string instead of reading a new one.
To force a new string to be read, call _read_comp with a
numeric argu- ment.</p>

<p>_complete_debug (^X?) This widget performs ordinary
completion, but captures in a tem- porary file a trace of
the shell commands executed by the com- pletion system. Each
completion attempt gets its own file. A command to view each
of these files is pushed onto the editor buffer stack.</p>

<p>_complete_help (^Xh) This widget displays information
about the context names, the tags, and the completion
functions used when completing at the current cursor
position. If given a numeric argument other than 1 (as in
ESC-2 ^Xh), then the styles used and the contexts for which
they are used will be shown, too.</p>

<p>Note that the information about styles may be
incomplete; it depends on the information available from the
completion func- tions called, which in turn is determined
by the users own styles and other settings.</p>

<p>_complete_help_generic Unlike other commands listed
here, this must be created as a normal ZLE widget rather
than a completion widget (i.e. with zle -N). It is used for
generating help with a widget bound to the _generic widget
that is described above.</p>

<p>If this widget is created using the name of the
function, as it is by default, then when executed it will
read a key sequence. This is expected to be bound to a call
to a completion function that uses the _generic widget. That
widget will be executed, and information provided in the
same format that the _com- plete_help widget displays for
contextual completion.</p>

<p>If the widgets name contains debug, for example if it is
cre- ated as zle -N _complete_debug_generic
_complete_help_generic, it will read and execute the
keystring for a generic widget as before, but then generate
debugging information as done by _com- plete_debug for
contextual completion.</p>

<p>If the widgets name contains noread, it will not read a
keystring but instead arrange that the next use of a generic
widget run in the same shell will have the effect as
described above.</p>

<p>The widget works by setting the shell parameter
ZSH_TRACE_GENERIC_WIDGET which is read by _generic.
Unsetting the parameter cancels any pending effect of the
noread form.</p>

<p>For example, after executing the following:</p>

<p>zle -N _complete_debug_generic _complete_help_generic
bindkey^x:_complete_debug_generic</p>

<p>typing C-x : followed by the key sequence for a generic
widget will cause trace output for that widget to be saved
to a file.</p>

<p>_complete_tag (^Xt) This widget completes symbol tags
created by the etags or ctags programmes (note there is no
connection with the completion sys- tem s tags) stored in a
file TAGS, in the format used by etags, or tags, in the
format created by ctags. It will look back up the path
hierarchy for the first occurrence of either file; if both
exist, the file TAGS is preferred. You can specify the full
path to a TAGS or tags file by setting the parameter $TAGS-
FILE or $tagsfile respectively. The corresponding completion
tags used are etags and vtags, after emacs and vi
respectively.</p>

<p>UTILITY FUNCTIONS Descriptions follow for utility
functions that may be useful when writ- ing completion
functions. If functions are installed in subdirecto- ries,
most of these reside in the Base subdirectory. Like the
example functions for commands in the distribution, the
utility functions gen- erating matches all follow the
convention of returning status zero if they generated
completions and non-zero if no matching completions could be
added.</p>

<p>Two more features are offered by the _main_complete
function. The arrays compprefuncs and comppostfuncs may
contain names of functions that are to be called immediately
before or after completion has been tried. A function will
only be called once unless it explicitly rein- serts itself
into the array.</p>

<p>_all_labels [ -x ] [ -12VJ ] tag name descr [ command
args ... ] This is a convenient interface to the _next_label
function below, implementing the loop shown in the
_next_label example. The command and its arguments are
called to generate the matches. The options stored in the
parameter name will automat- ically be inserted into the
args passed to the command. Nor- mally, they are put
directly after the command, but if one of the args is a
single hyphen, they are inserted directly before that. If
the hyphen is the last argument, it will be removed from the
argument list before the command is called. This allows
_all_labels to be used in almost all cases where the matches
can be generated by a single call to the compadd builtin
command or by a call to one of the utility functions.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>local expl ... if _requested foo; then ... _all_labels
foo expl ... compadd ... - $matches fi</p>

<p>Will complete the strings from the matches parameter,
using com- padd with additional options which will take
precedence over those generated by _all_labels.</p>

<p>_alternative [ -C name ] spec ... This function is
useful in simple cases where multiple tags are available.
Essentially it implements a loop like the one described for
the _tags function below.</p>

<p>The tags to use and the action to perform if a tag is
requested are described using the specs which are of the
form: tag:descr:action. The tags are offered using _tags and
if the tag is requested, the action is executed with the
given descrip- tion descr. The actions are those accepted by
the _arguments function (described below), excluding the
-&gt;state and =... forms.</p>

<p>For example, the action may be a simple function
call:</p>

<p>_alternative users:user:_users hosts:host:_hosts</p>

<p>offers usernames and hostnames as possible matches,
generated by the _users and _hosts functions
respectively.</p>

<p>Like _arguments, this functions uses _all_labels to
execute the actions, which will loop over all sets of tags.
Special han- dling is only required if there is an
additional valid tag, for example inside a function called
from _alternative.</p>

<p>Like _tags this function supports the -C option to give
a dif- ferent name for the argument context field.</p>

<p>_arguments [ -nswWACRS ] [ -O name ] [ -M matchspec ] [
: ] spec ... This function can be used to give a complete
specification for completion for a command whose arguments
follow standard UNIX option and argument conventions. The
following forms specify individual sets of options and
arguments; to avoid ambiguity, these may be separated from
the options to _arguments itself by a single colon. Options
to _arguments itself must be in sepa- rate words, i.e. -s
-w, not -sw.</p>

<p>With the option -n, _arguments sets the parameter
NORMARG to the position of the first normal argument in the
$words array, i.e. the position after the end of the
options. If that argument has not been reached, NORMARG is
set to -1. The caller should declare integer NORMARG if the
-n option is passed; otherwise the parameter is not
used.</p>

<p>n:message:action n::message:action This describes the n
th normal argument. The message will be printed above the
matches generated and the action indicates what can be
completed in this position (see below). If there are two
colons before the message the argument is optional. If the
message contains only white space, nothing will be printed
above the matches unless the action adds an explanation
string itself.</p>

<p>:message:action ::message:action Similar, but describes
the next argument, whatever number that happens to be. If
all arguments are specified in this form in the correct
order the numbers are unneces- sary.</p>

<p>*:message:action *::message:action *:::message:action
This describes how arguments (usually non-option argu-
ments, those not beginning with - or +) are to be com-
pleted when neither of the first two forms was provided. Any
number of arguments can be completed in this fashion.</p>

<p>With two colons before the message, the words special
array and the CURRENT special parameter are modified to
refer only to the normal arguments when the action is
executed or evaluated. With three colons before the mes-
sage they are modified to refer only to the normal argu-
ments covered by this description.</p>

<p>optspec optspec:... This describes an option. The colon
indicates handling for one or more arguments to the option;
if it is not present, the option is assumed to take no
arguments.</p>

<p>By default, options are multi-character name, one -word
per option. With -s, options may be single characters, with
more than one option per word, although words start- ing
with two hyphens, such as --prefix, are still con- sidered
complete option names. This is suitable for standard GNU
options.</p>

<p>The combination of -s with -w allows single-letter
options to be combined in a single word even if one or more
of the options take arguments. For example, if -a takes an
argument, with no -s -ab is considered as a single
(unhandled) option; with -s -ab is an option with the
argument b; with both -s and -w, -ab may be the option -a
and the option -b with arguments still to come.</p>

<p>The option -W takes this a stage further: it is possible
to complete single-letter options even after an argument
that occurs in the same word. However, it depends on the
action performed whether options will really be completed at
this point. For more control, use a utility function like
_guard as part of the action.</p>

<p>The following forms are available for the initial opt-
spec, whether or not the option has arguments.</p>

<p>*optspec Here optspec is one of the remaining forms
below. This indicates the following optspec may be repeated.
Otherwise if the corresponding option is already present on
the command line to the left of the cursor it will not be
offered again.</p>

<p>-optname +optname In the simplest form the optspec is
just the option name beginning with a minus or a plus sign,
such as -foo . The first argument for the option (if any)
must follow as a separate word directly after the
option.</p>

<p>Either of -+optname and +-optname can be used to specify
that -optname and +optname are both valid.</p>

<p>In all the remaining forms, the leading - may be
replaced by or paired with + in this way.</p>

<p>-optname- The first argument of the option must come
directly after the option name in the same word. For
example, -foo-:... specifies that the com- pleted option and
argument will look like -fooarg.</p>

<p>-optname+ The first argument may appear immediately
after optname in the same word, or may appear as a sep-
arate word after the option. For example, -foo+:...
specifies that the completed option and argument will look
like either -fooarg or -foo arg.</p>

<p>-optname= The argument may appear as the next word, or
in same word as the option name provided that it is
separated from it by an equals sign, for example -foo=arg or
-foo arg.</p>

<p>-optname=- The argument to the option must appear after
an equals sign in the same word, and may not be given in the
next argument.</p>

<p>optspec[explanation] An explanation string may be
appended to any of the preceding forms of optspec by
enclosing it in brackets, as in -q[query operation].</p>

<p>The verbose style is used to decide whether the
explanation strings are displayed with the option in a
completion listing.</p>

<p>If no bracketed explanation string is given but the
auto-description style is set and only one argument is
described for this optspec, the value of the style is
displayed, with any appearance of the sequence %d in it
replaced by the message of the first optarg that follows the
optspec; see below.</p>

<p>It is possible for options with a literal + or = to
appear, but that character must be quoted, for example
+.</p>

<p>Each optarg following an optspec must take one of the
following forms:</p>

<p>:message:action ::message:action An argument to the
option; message and action are treated as for ordinary
arguments. In the first form, the argu- ment is mandatory,
and in the second form it is optional.</p>

<p>This group may be repeated for options which take multi-
ple arguments. In other words, :message1:action1:mes-
sage2:action2 specifies that the option takes two argu-
ments.</p>

<p>:*pattern:message:action :*pattern::message:action
:*pattern:::message:action This describes multiple
arguments. Only the last optarg for an option taking
multiple arguments may be given in this form. If the pattern
is empty (i.e., :*:), all the remaining words on the line
are to be completed as described by the action; otherwise,
all the words up to and including a word matching the
pattern are to be com- pleted using the action.</p>

<p>Multiple colons are treated as for the *:... forms for
ordinary arguments: when the message is preceded by two
colons, the words special array and the CURRENT special
parameter are modified during the execution or evaluation of
the action to refer only to the words after the option. When
preceded by three colons, they are modified to refer only to
the words covered by this description.</p>

<p>Any literal colon in an optname, message, or action must
be preceded by a backslash:.</p>

<p>Each of the forms above may be preceded by a list in
parentheses of option names and argument numbers. If the
given option is on the com- mand line, the options and
arguments indicated in parentheses will not be offered. For
example, (-two -three 1)-one:... completes the option -one;
if this appears on the command line, the options -two and
-three and the first ordinary argument will not be completed
after it. (-foo):... specifies an ordinary argument
completion; -foo will not be completed if that argument is
already present.</p>

<p>Other items may appear in the list of excluded options
to indicate var- ious other items that should not be applied
when the current specifica- tion is matched: a single star
(*) for the rest arguments (i.e. a spec- ification of the
form *:...); a colon (:) for all normal (non-option-)
arguments; and a hyphen (-) for all options. For exam- ple,
if (*) appears before an option and the option appears on
the command line, the list of remaining arguments (those
shown in the above table beginning with *:) will not be
completed.</p>

<p>To aid in reuse of specifications, it is possible to
precede any of the forms above with !; then the form will no
longer be completed, although if the option or argument
appears on the command line they will be skipped as normal.
The main use for this is when the arguments are given by an
array, and _arguments is called repeatedly for more specific
contexts: on the first call _arguments $global_options is
used, and on subsequent calls _arguments !$^global_options
.</p>

<p>In each of the forms above the action determines how
completions should be generated. Except for the -&gt;string
form below, the action will be executed by calling the
_all_labels function to process all tag labels. No special
handling of tags is needed unless a function call introduces
a new one.</p>

<p>The forms for action are as follows.</p>

<p>(single unquoted space) This is useful where an argument
is required but it is not pos- sible or desirable to
generate matches for it. The message will be displayed but
no completions listed. Note that even in this case the colon
at the end of the message is needed; it may only be omitted
when neither a message nor an action is given.</p>

<p>(item1 item2 ...) One of a list of possible matches, for
example:</p>

<p>:foo:(foo bar baz)</p>

<p>((item:desc1 ...)) Similar to the above, but with
descriptions for each possible match. Note the backslash
before the colon. For example,</p>

<p>:foo:((:bar :baz))</p>

<p>The matches will be listed together with their
descriptions if the description style is set with the values
tag in the context.</p>

<p>-&gt;string In this form, _arguments processes the
arguments and options and then returns control to the
calling function with parameters set to indicate the state
of processing; the calling function then makes its own
arrangements for generating completions. For example,
functions that implement a state machine can use this type
of action.</p>

<p>Where _arguments encounters a -&gt;string , it will
strip all leading and trailing whitespace from string and
set the array state to the set of all stringss for which an
action is to be performed.</p>

<p>By default and in common with all other well behaved
completion functions, _arguments returns status zero if it
was able to add matches and non-zero otherwise. However, if
the -R option is given, _arguments will instead return a
status of 300 to indi- cate that $state is to be
handled.</p>

<p>In addition to $state, _arguments also sets the global
parame- ters context, line and opt_args as described below,
and does not reset any changes made to the special
parameters such as PREFIX and words. This gives the calling
function the choice of resetting these parameters or
propagating changes in them.</p>

<p>A function calling _arguments with at least one action
contain- ing a -&gt;string therefore must declare
appropriate local param- eters:</p>

<p>local context state line typeset -A opt_args</p>

<p>to avoid _arguments from altering the global
environment.</p>

<p>{eval-string} A string in braces is evaluated as shell
code to generate matches. If the eval-string itself does not
begin with an open- ing parenthesis or brace it is split
into separate words before execution.</p>

<p>= action If the action starts with = (an equals sign
followed by a space), _arguments will insert the contents of
the argument field of the current context as the new first
element in the words special array and increment the value
of the CURRENT spe- cial parameter. This has the effect of
inserting a dummy word onto the completion command line
while not changing the point at which completion is taking
place.</p>

<p>This is most useful with one of the specifiers that
restrict the words on the command line on which the action
is to operate (the two- and three-colon forms above). One
particular use is when an action itself causes _arguments on
a restricted range; it is necessary to use this trick to
insert an appropriate command name into the range for the
second call to _arguments to be able to parse the line.</p>

<p>word... word... This covers all forms other than those
above. If the action starts with a space, the remaining list
of words will be invoked unchanged.</p>

<p>Otherwise it will be invoked with some extra strings
placed after the first word; these are to be passed down as
options to the compadd builtin. They ensure that the state
specified by _arguments, in particular the descriptions of
options and argu- ments, is correctly passed to the
completion command. These additional arguments are taken
from the array parameter expl; this will be set up before
executing the action and hence may be referred to inside it,
typically in an expansion of the form $expl[@] which
preserves empty elements of the array.</p>

<p>During the performance of the action the array line will
be set to the command name and normal arguments from the
command line, i.e. the words from the command line excluding
all options and their arguments. Options are stored in the
associative array opt_args with option names as keys and
their arguments as the values. For options that have more
than one argument these are given as one string, separated
by colons. All colons in the original arguments are preceded
with back- slashes.</p>

<p>The parameter context is set when returning to the
calling function to perform an action of the form
-&gt;string. It is set to an array of elements corresponding
to the elements of $state. Each element is a suitable name
for the argument field of the context: either a string of
the form option-opt-n for the nth argument of the option
-opt, or a string of the form argument-n for the nth
argument. For rest arguments, that is those in the list at
the end not handled by posi- tion, n is the string rest .
For example, when completing the argu- ment of the -o
option, the name is option-o-1, while for the second normal
(non-option-) argument it is argument-2.</p>

<p>Furthermore, during the evaluation of the action the
context name in the curcontext parameter is altered to
append the same string that is stored in the context
parameter.</p>

<p>It is possible to specify multiple sets of options and
arguments with the sets separated by single hyphens. The
specifications before the first hyphen (if any) are shared
by all the remaining sets. The first word in every other set
provides a name for the set which may appear in exclusion
lists in specifications, either alone or before one of the
possible values described above. In the second case a -
should appear between this name and the remainder.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>_arguments -a - set1 -c - set2 -d :arg:(x2 y2)</p>

<p>This defines two sets. When the command line contains
the option -c, the -d option and the argument will not be
considered possible com- pletions. When it contains -d or an
argument, the option -c will not be considered. However,
after -a both sets will still be consid- ered valid.</p>

<p>If the name given for one of the mutually exclusive sets
is of the form (name) then only one value from each set will
ever be completed; more formally, all specifications are
mutually exclusive to all other speci- fications in the same
set. This is useful for defining multiple sets of options
which are mutually exclusive and in which the options are
aliases for each other. For example:</p>

<p>_arguments -a -b - (compress) {-c,--compress} [compress]
-(uncompress) {-d,--decompress[decompress]</p>

<p>As the completion code has to parse the command line
separately for each set this form of argument is slow and
should only be used when necessary. A useful alternative is
often an option specification with rest-arguments (as in
-foo:*:...); here the option -foo swallows up all remaining
arguments as described by the optarg definitions.</p>

<p>The options -S and -A are available to simplify the
specifications for commands with standard option parsing.
With -S, no option will be com- pleted after a -- appearing
on its own on the line; this argument will otherwise be
ignored; hence in the line</p>

<p>foobar -a -- -b</p>

<p>the -a is considered an option but the -b is considered
an argu- ment, while the -- is considered to be neither.</p>

<p>With -A, no options will be completed after the first
non-option argu- ment on the line. The -A must be followed
by a pattern matching all strings which are not to be taken
as arguments. For example, to make _arguments stop
completing options after the first normal argument, but
ignoring all strings starting with a hyphen even if they are
not described by one of the optspecs, the form is -A
&quot;-*&quot;.</p>

<p>The option -O name specifies the name of an array whose
elements will be passed as arguments to functions called to
execute actions. For example, this can be used to pass the
same set of options for the com- padd builtin to all
actions.</p>

<p>The option -M spec sets a match specification to use to
completion option names and values. It must appear before
the first argument specification. The default is r:|[_-]=*
r:|=*: this allows partial word completion after _ and -,
for example -f-b can be completed to -foo-bar.</p>

<p>The option -C tells _arguments to modify the curcontext
parameter for an action of the form -&gt;state. This is the
standard parameter used to keep track of the current
context. Here it (and not the context array) should be made
local to the calling function to avoid passing back the
modified value and should be initialised to the current
value at the start of the function:</p>

<p>local curcontext=&quot;$curcontext&quot;</p>

<p>This is useful where it is not possible for multiple
states to be valid together.</p>

<p>The option -- allows _arguments to work out the names of
long options that support the --help option which is
standard in many GNU com- mands. The command word is called
with the argument --help and the output examined for option
names. Clearly, it can be dangerous to pass this to commands
which may not support this option as the behaviour of the
command is unspecified.</p>

<p>In addition to options, _arguments -- will try to deduce
the types of arguments available for options when the form
--opt=val is valid. It is also possible to provide hints by
examining the help text of the command and adding specifiers
of the form pattern:message:action; note that normal
_arguments specifiers are not used. The pattern is matched
against the help text for an option, and if it matches the
mes- sage and action are used as for other argument
specifiers. For exam- ple:</p>

<p>_arguments -- *:toggle:(yes no) *=FILE*:file:_files
*=DIR*:directory:_files -/ *=PATH*:directory:_files -/</p>

<p>Here, yes and no will be completed as the argument of
options whose description ends in a star; file names will be
completed for options that contain the substring =FILE in
the description; and directories will be completed for
options whose description contains =DIR or =PATH. The last
three are in fact the default and so need not be given
explicitly, although it is possible to override the use of
these patterns. A typical help text which uses this feature
is:</p>

<p>-C, --directory=DIR change to directory DIR</p>

<p>so that the above specifications will cause directories
to be completed after --directory, though not after -C.</p>

<p>Note also that _arguments tries to find out
automatically if the argu- ment for an option is optional.
This can be specified explicitly by doubling the colon
before the message.</p>

<p>If the pattern ends in (-), this will removed from the
pattern and the action will be used only directly after the
=, not in the next word. This is the behaviour of a normal
specification defined with the form =-.</p>

<p>The _arguments -- can be followed by the option -i
patterns to give patterns for options which are not to be
completed. The patterns can be given as the name of an array
parameter or as a literal list in parentheses. For
example,</p>

<p>_arguments -- -i
&quot;(--(en|dis)able-FEATURE*)&quot;</p>

<p>will cause completion to ignore the options
--enable-FEATURE and --disable-FEATURE (this example is
useful with GNU configure).</p>

<p>The _arguments -- form can also be followed by the
option -s pair to describe option aliases. Each pair
consists of a pattern and a replacement. For example, some
configure-scripts describe options only as --enable-foo ,
but also accept --disable-foo. To allow comple- tion of the
second form:</p>

<p>_arguments -- -s &quot;(#--enable- --disable-)&quot;</p>

<p>Here is a more general example of the use of
_arguments:</p>

<p>_arguments-l+:left border: -format:paper size:(letter
A4) *-copy:output file:_files::resolution:(300 600)
:postscript file:_files -g *(p|ep) *:page number:</p>

<p>This describes three options: -l, -format, and -copy.
The first takes one argument described as left border for
which no completion will be offered because of the empty
action. Its argument may come directly after the -l or it
may be given as the next word on the line.</p>

<p>The -format option takes one argument in the next word,
described as paper size for which only the strings letter
and A4 will be com- pleted.</p>

<p>The -copy option may appear more than once on the
command line and takes two arguments. The first is mandatory
and will be completed as a filename. The second is optional
(because of the second colon before the description
resolution) and will be completed from the strings 300 and
600.</p>

<p>The last two descriptions say what should be completed
as arguments. The first describes the first argument as a
postscript file and makes files ending in ps or eps be
completed. The last description gives all other arguments
the description page numbers but does not offer
completions.</p>

<p>_cache_invalid cache_identifier This function returns
status zero if the completions cache cor- responding to the
given cache identifier needs rebuilding. It determines this
by looking up the cache-policy style for the current
context. This should provide a function name which is run
with the full path to the relevant cache file as the only
argument.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>_example_caching_policy () { # rebuild if cache is more
than a week old local -a oldp oldp=( &quot;$1&quot;(Nmw+1) )
(( $#oldp )) }</p>

<p>_call_function return name [ args ... ] If a function
name exists, it is called with the arguments args. The
return argument gives the name of a parameter in which the
return status from the function name; if return is empty or
a single hyphen it is ignored.</p>

<p>The return status of _call_function itself is zero if
the func- tion name exists and was called and non-zero
otherwise.</p>

<p>_call_program tag string ... This function provides a
mechanism for the user to override the use of an external
command. It looks up the command style with the supplied
tag. If the style is set, its value is used as the command
to execute. The strings from the call to _call_program, or
from the style if set, are concatenated with spaces between
them and the resulting string is evaluated. The return
status is the return status of the command called.</p>

<p>_combination [ -s pattern ] tag style spec ... field
opts ... This function is used to complete combinations of
values, for example pairs of hostnames and usernames. The
style argument gives the style which defines the pairs; it
is looked up in a context with the tag specified.</p>

<p>The style name consists of field names separated by
hyphens, for example users-hosts-ports. For each field for a
value is already known, a spec of the form field=pattern is
given. For example, if the command line so far specifies a
user pws, the argument users=pws should appear.</p>

<p>The next argument with no equals sign is taken as the
name of the field for which completions should be generated
(presumably not one of the fields for which the value is
known).</p>

<p>The matches generated will be taken from the value of
the style. These should contain the possible values for the
combinations in the appropriate order (users, hosts, ports
in the example above). The different fields the values for
the different fields are separated by colons. This can be
altered with the option -s to _combination which specifies a
pattern. Typically this is a character class, as for example
-s &quot;[:@]&quot; in the case of the users-hosts style.
Each field=pattern specifi- cation restricts the completions
which apply to elements of the style with appropriately
matching fields.</p>

<p>If no style with the given name is defined for the given
tag, or if none of the strings in styles value match, but a
function name of the required field preceded by an
underscore is defined, that function will be called to
generate the matches. For exam- ple, if there is no
users-hosts-ports or no matching hostname when a host is
required, the function _hosts will automati- cally be
called.</p>

<p>If the same name is used for more than one field, in
both the field=pattern and the argument that gives the name
of the field to be completed, the number of the field
(starting with one) may be given after the fieldname,
separated from it by a colon.</p>

<p>All arguments after the required field name are passed
to com- padd when generating matches from the style value,
or to the functions for the fields if they are called.</p>

<p>_describe [ -oO | -t tag ] descr name1 [ name2 ] opts
... -- ... This function associates completions with
descriptions. Multi- ple groups separated by -- can be
supplied, potentially with different completion options
opts.</p>

<p>The descr is taken as a string to display above the
matches if the format style for the descriptions tag is set.
This is fol- lowed by one or two names of arrays followed by
options to pass to compadd. The first array contains the
possible completions with their descriptions in the form
completion:description. Any literal colons in completion
must be quoted with a back- slash. If a second array is
given, it should have the same num- ber of elements as the
first; in this case the corresponding elements are added as
possible completions instead of the com- pletion strings
from the first array. The completion list will retain the
descriptions from the first array. Finally, a set of
completion options can appear.</p>

<p>If the option -o appears before the first argument, the
matches added will be treated as names of command options
(N.B. not shell options), typically following a -, -- or +
on the command line. In this case _describe uses the
prefix-hid- den, prefix-needed and verbose styles to find
out if the strings should be added as completions and if the
descriptions should be shown. Without the -o option, only
the verbose style is used to decide how descriptions are
shown. If -O is used instead of -O, command options are
completed as above but _describe will not handle the
prefix-needed style.</p>

<p>With the -t option a tag can be specified. The default
is val- ues or, if the -o option is given, options.</p>

<p>If selected by the list-grouped style, strings with the
same description will appear together in the list.</p>

<p>_describe uses the _all_labels function to generate the
matches, so it does not need to appear inside a loop over
tag labels.</p>

<p>_description [ -x ] [ -12VJ ] tag name descr [ spec ...
] This function is not to be confused with the previous one;
it is used as a helper function for creating options to
compadd. It is buried inside many of the higher level
completion functions and so often does not need to be called
directly.</p>

<p>The styles listed below are tested in the current
context using the given tag. The resulting options for
compadd are put into the array named name (this is
traditionally expl, but this convention is not enforced).
The description for the corre- sponding set of matches is
passed to the function in descr.</p>

<p>The styles tested are: format, hidden, matcher,
ignored-patterns and group-name. The format style is first
tested for the given tag and then for the descriptions tag
if no value was found, while the remainder are only tested
for the tag given as the first argument. The function also
calls _setup which tests some more styles.</p>

<p>The string returned by the format style (if any) will be
modi- fied so that the sequence %d is replaced by the descr
given as the third argument without any leading or trailing
white space. If, after removing the white space, the descr
is the empty string, the format style will not be used and
the options put into the name array will not contain an
explanation string to be displayed above the matches.</p>

<p>If _description is called with more than three
arguments, the additional specs should be of the form
char:str . These supply escape sequence replacements for the
format style: every appear- ance of %char will be replaced
by string.</p>

<p>If the -x option is given, the description will be
passed to compadd using the -x option instead of the default
-X. This means that the description will be displayed even
if there are no corresponding matches.</p>

<p>The options placed in the array name take account of the
group-name style, so matches are placed in a separate group
where necessary. The group normally has its elements sorted
(by passing the option -J to compadd), but if an option
starting with -V, -J, -1, or -2 is passed to _description,
that option will be included in the array. Hence it is
possible for the completion group to be unsorted by giving
the option -V, -1V, or -2V.</p>

<p>In most cases, the function will be used like this:</p>

<p>local expl _description files expl file compadd
&quot;$expl[@]&quot; - &quot;$files[@]&quot;</p>

<p>Note the use of the parameter expl, the hyphen, and the
list of matches. Almost all calls to compadd within the
completion sys- tem use a similar format; this ensures that
user-specified styles are correctly passed down to the
builtins which implement the internals of completion.</p>

<p>_dispatch context string ... This sets the current
context to context and looks for comple- tion functions to
handle this context by hunting through the list of command
names or special contexts (as described above for compdef)
given as string .... The first completion function to be
defined for one of the contexts in the list is used to
generate matches. Typically, the last string is -default- to
cause the function for default completion to be used as a
fall- back.</p>

<p>The function sets the parameter $service to the string
being tried, and sets the context/command field (the fourth)
of the $curcontext parameter to the context given as the
first argu- ment.</p>

<p>_files The function _files calls _path_files with all
the arguments it was passed except for -g and -/. The use of
these two options depends on the setting of the
file-patterns style.</p>

<p>This function accepts the full set of options allowed by
_path_files, described below.</p>

<p>_gnu_generic This function is a simple wrapper around
the _arguments function described above. It can be used to
determine automatically the long options understood by
commands that produce a list when passed the option --help.
It is intended to be used as a top-level completion function
in its own right. For example, to enable option completion
for the commands foo and bar, use</p>

<p>compdef _gnu_generic foo bar</p>

<p>after the call to compinit.</p>

<p>The completion system as supplied is conservative in its
use of this function, since it is important to be sure the
command understands the option --help.</p>

<p>_guard [ options ] pattern descr This function is
intended to be used in the action for the spec- ifications
passed to _arguments and similar functions. It returns
immediately with a non-zero return status if the string to
be completed does not match the pattern. If the pattern
matches, the descr is displayed; the function then returns
sta- tus zero if the word to complete is not empty, non-zero
other- wise.</p>

<p>The pattern may be preceded by any of the options
understood by compadd that are passed down from
_description, namely -M, -J, -V, -1, -2, -n, -F and -X. All
of these options will be ignored. This fits in conveniently
with the argument-passing conventions of actions for
_arguments.</p>

<p>As an example, consider a command taking the options -n
and -none, where -n must be followed by a numeric value in
the same word. By using:</p>

<p>_arguments -n-: :_guard &quot;[0-9]#&quot; &quot;numeric
value-none</p>

<p>_arguments can be made to both display the message
numeric value and complete options after -n&lt;TAB&gt;. If
the -n is already followed by one or more digits (the
pattern passed to _guard) only the message will be
displayed; if the -n is fol- lowed by another character,
only options are completed.</p>

<p>_message [ -r12 ] [ -VJ group ] descr _message -e [ tag
] descr The descr is used in the same way as the third
argument to the _description function, except that the
resulting string will always be shown whether or not matches
were generated. This is useful for displaying a help message
in places where no comple- tions can be generated.</p>

<p>The format style is examined with the messages tag to
find a message; the usual tag, descriptions, is used only if
the style is not set with the former.</p>

<p>If the -r option is given, no style is used; the descr
is taken literally as the string to display. This is most
useful when the descr comes from a pre-processed argument
list which already contains an expanded description.</p>

<p>The -12VJ options and the group are passed to compadd
and hence determine the group the message string is added
to.</p>

<p>The second form gives a description for completions with
the tag tag to be shown even if there are no matches for
that tag. The tag can be omitted and if so the tag is taken
from the parameter $curtag; this is maintained by the
completion system and so is usually correct.</p>

<p>_multi_parts sep array The argument sep is a separator
character. The array may be either the name of an array
parameter or a literal array in the form (foo bar), a
parenthesised list of words separated by whitespace. The
possible completions are the strings from the array.
However, each chunk delimited by sep will be completed
separately. For example, the _tar function uses _multi_parts
/ patharray to complete partial file paths from the given
array of complete file paths.</p>

<p>The -i option causes _multi_parts to insert a unique
match even if that requires multiple separators to be
inserted. This is not usually the expected behaviour with
filenames, but certain other types of completion, for
example those with a fixed set of possibilities, may be more
suited to this form.</p>

<p>Like other utility functions, this function accepts the
-V, -J, -1, -2, -n, -f, -X, -M, -P, -S, -r, -R, and -q
options and passes them to the compadd builtin.</p>

<p>_next_label [ -x ] [ -12VJ ] tag name descr [ options
... ] This function is used to implement the loop over
different tag labels for a particular tag as described above
for the tag-order style. On each call it checks to see if
there are any more tag labels; if there is it returns status
zero, otherwise non-zero. As this function requires a
current tag to be set, it must always follow a call to _tags
or _requested.</p>

<p>The -x12VJ options and the first three arguments are
passed to the _description function. Where appropriate the
tag will be replaced by a tag label in this call. Any
description given in the tag-order style is preferred to the
descr passed to _next_label.</p>

<p>The options given after the descr are set in the
parameter given by name, and hence are to be passed to
compadd or whatever func- tion is called to add the
matches.</p>

<p>Here is a typical use of this function for the tag foo.
The call to _requested determines if tag foo is required at
all; the loop over _next_label handles any labels defined
for the tag in the tag-order style.</p>

<p>local expl ret=1 ... if _requested foo; then ... while
_next_label foo expl..; do compadd &quot;$expl[@]&quot; ...
&amp;&amp; ret=0 done ... fi return ret</p>

<p>_normal This is the standard function called to handle
completion out- side any special -context-. It is called
both to complete the command word and also the arguments for
a command. In the sec- ond case, _normal looks for a special
completion for that com- mand, and if there is none it uses
the completion for the -default- context.</p>

<p>A second use is to reexamine the command line specified
by the $words array and the $CURRENT parameter after those
have been modified. For example, the function _precommand,
which com- pletes after pre-command specifiers such as
nohup, removes the first word from the words array,
decrements the CURRENT parame- ter, then calls _normal
again. The effect is that nohup cmd ... is treated in the
same way as cmd ....</p>

<p>If the command name matches one of the patterns given by
one of the options -p or -P to compdef, the corresponding
completion function is called and then the parameter
_compskip is checked. If it is set completion is terminated
at that point even if no matches have been found. This is
the same effect as in the -first- context.</p>

<p>_options This can be used to complete the names of shell
options. It provides a matcher specification that ignores a
leading no, ignores underscores and allows upper-case
letters to match their lower-case counterparts (for example,
glob, noglob, NO_GLOB are all completed). Any arguments are
propagated to the compadd builtin.</p>

<p>_options_set and _options_unset These functions complete
only set or unset options, with the same matching
specification used in the _options function.</p>

<p>Note that you need to uncomment a few lines in the
_main_com- plete function for these functions to work
properly. The lines in question are used to store the option
settings in effect before the completion widget locally sets
the options it needs. Hence these functions are not
generally used by the completion system.</p>

<p>_parameters This is used to complete the names of shell
parameters.</p>

<p>The option -g pattern limits the completion to
parameters whose type matches the pattern. The type of a
parameter is that shown by print ${(t)param}, hence
judicious use of * in pat- tern is probably necessary.</p>

<p>All other arguments are passed to the compadd
builtin.</p>

<p>_path_files This function is used throughout the
completion system to com- plete filenames. It allows
completion of partial paths. For example, the string
/u/i/s/sig may be completed to
/usr/include/sys/signal.h.</p>

<p>The options accepted by both _path_files and _files
are:</p>

<p>-f Complete all filenames. This is the default.</p>

<p>-/ Specifies that only directories should be
completed.</p>

<p>-g pattern Specifies that only files matching the
pattern should be completed.</p>

<p>-W paths Specifies path prefixes that are to be
prepended to the string from the command line to generate
the filenames but that should not be inserted as completions
nor shown in completion listings. Here, paths may be the
name of an array parameter, a literal list of paths enclosed
in parentheses or an absolute pathname.</p>

<p>-F ignored-files This behaves as for the corresponding
option to the com- padd builtin. It gives direct control
over which file- names should be ignored. If the option is
not present, the ignored-patterns style is used.</p>

<p>Both _path_files and _files also accept the following
options which are passed to compadd: -J, -V, -1, -2, -n, -X
, -M, -P, -S, -q, -r, and -R.</p>

<p>Finally, the _path_files function uses the styles
expand, ambiguous, special-dirs, list-suffixes and file-sort
described above.</p>

<p>_pick_variant [ -c command ] [ -r name ] label=pattern
... label [ args ... ] This function is used to resolve
situations where a single com- mand name requires more than
one type of handling, either because it has more than one
variant or because there is a name clash between two
different commands.</p>

<p>The command to run is taken from the first element of
the array words unless this is overridden by the option -c.
This command is run and its output is compared with a series
of patterns. Arguments to be passed to the command can be
specified at the end after all the other arguments. The
patterns to try in order are given by the arguments
label=pattern; if the output of com- mand args ... contains
pattern, then label is selected as the label for the command
variant. If none of the patterns match, the final command
label is selected and status 1 is returned.</p>

<p>If the -r name is given, the label picked is stored in
the parameter named name.</p>

<p>The results are also cached in the _cmd_variant
associative array indexed by the name of the command
run.</p>

<p>_regex_arguments name spec ... This function generates a
completion function name which matches the specifications
spec ..., a set of regular expressions as described below.
After running _regex_arguments, the function name should be
called as a normal completion function. The pat- tern to be
matched is given by the contents of the words array up to
the current cursor position joined together with null
characters; no quotation is applied.</p>

<p>The arguments are grouped as sets of alternatives
separated by |, which are tried one after the other until
one matches. Each alternative consists of a one or more
specifications which are tried left to right, with each
pattern matched being stripped in turn from the command line
being tested, until all of the group succeeds or until one
fails; in the latter case, the next alternative is tried.
This structure can be repeated to arbitrary depth by using
parentheses; matching proceeds from inside to outside.</p>

<p>A special procedure is applied if no test succeeds but
the remaining command line string contains no null character
(imply- ing the remaining word is the one for which
completions are to be generated). The completion target is
restricted to the remaining word and any actions for the
corresponding patterns are executed. In this case, nothing
is stripped from the com- mand line string. The order of
evaluation of the actions can be determined by the tag-order
style; the various formats supported by _alternative can be
used in action. The descr is used for setting up the array
parameter expl.</p>

<p>Specification arguments take one of following forms, in
which metacharacters such as ( , ), # and | should be
quoted.</p>

<p>/pattern/ [%lookahead%] [-guard] [:tag:descr:action]
This is a single primitive component. The function tests
whether the combined pattern (#b)((#B)pattern)looka- head*
matches the command line string. If so, guard is evaluated
and its return status is examined to deter- mine if the test
has succeeded. The pattern string [] is guaranteed never to
match. The lookahead is not stripped from the command line
before the next pattern is examined.</p>

<p>The argument starting with : is used in the same manner
as an argument to _alternative.</p>

<p>A component is used as follows: pattern is tested to see
if the component already exists on the command line. If it
does, any following specifications are examined to find
something to complete. If a component is reached but no such
pattern exists yet on the command line, the string
containing the action is used to generate matches to insert
at that point.</p>

<p>/pattern/+ [%lookahead%] [-guard] [:tag:descr:action]
This is similar to /pattern/ ... but the left part of the
command line string (i.e. the part already matched by
previous patterns) is also considered part of the comple-
tion target.</p>

<p>/pattern/- [%lookahead%] [-guard] [:tag:descr:action]
This is similar to /pattern/ ... but the actions of the
current and previously matched patterns are ignored even if
the following pattern matches the empty string.</p>

<p>( spec ) Parentheses may be used to groups specs; note
each paren- thesis is a single argument to
_regex_arguments.</p>

<p>spec # This allows any number of repetitions of
spec.</p>

<p>spec spec The two specs are to be matched one after the
other as described above.</p>

<p>spec | spec Either of the two specs can be matched.</p>

<p>The function _regex_words can be used as a helper
function to generate matches for a set of alternative words
possibly with their own arguments as a command line
argument.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<p>_regex_arguments _tst /$ [0]0 / /[0]/ compadd aaa</p>

<p>This generates a function _tst that completes aaa as its
only argument. The tag and description for the action have
been omitted for brevity (this works but is not recommended
in normal use). The first component matches the command
word, which is arbitrary; the second matches any argument.
As the argument is also arbitrary, any following component
would not depend on aaa being present.</p>

<p>_regex_arguments _tst /$ [0]0 / /aa/ compadd aaa</p>

<p>This is a more typical use; it is similar, but any
following patterns would only match if aaa was present as
the first argu- ment.</p>

<p>_regex_arguments _tst /$ [0]0 / ( /aa/ compadd aaa /bb/
compadd bb) In this example, an indefinite number of command
arguments may be completed. Odd arguments are completed as
aaa and even argu- ments as bbb. Completion fails unless the
set of aaa and bbb arguments before the current one is
matched correctly.</p>

<p>_regex_arguments _tst /$ [0]0 / ( /aa/ compadd aa| /bb/
compadd bb) This is similar, but either aaa or bbb may be
completed for any argument. In this case _regex_words could
be used to generate a suitable expression for the
arguments.</p>

<p>_regex_words tag description spec ... This function can
be used to generate arguments for the _regex_arguments
command which may be inserted at any point where a set of
rules is expected. The tag and description give a standard
tag and description pertaining to the current con- text.
Each spec contains two or three arguments separated by a
colon: note that there is no leading colon in this case.</p>

<p>Each spec gives one of a set of words that may be
completed at this point, together with arguments. It is thus
roughly equiva- lent to the _arguments function when used in
normal (non-regex) completion.</p>

<p>The part of the spec before the first colon is the word
to be completed. This may contain a *; the entire word,
before and after the * is completed, but only the text
before the * is required for the context to be matched, so
that further argu- ments may be completed after the
abbreviated form.</p>

<p>The second part of spec is a description for the word
being com- pleted.</p>

<p>The optional third part of the spec describes how words
follow- ing the one being completed are themselves to be
completed. It will be evaluated in order to avoid problems
with quoting. This means that typically it contains a
reference to an array con- taining previously generated
regex arguments.</p>

<p>The option -t term specifies a terminator for the word
instead of the usual space. This is handled as an
auto-removable suffix in the manner of the option -s sep to
_values.</p>

<p>The result of the processing by _regex_words is placed
in the array reply, which should be made local to the
calling function. If the set of words and arguments may be
matched repeatedly, a # should be appended to the generated
array at that point.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>local -a reply _regex_words mydb-commands mydb commands
add:add an entry to mydb:$mydb_add_cmds show:show entries in
mydb _regex_arguments _mydb &quot;$reply[@]&quot; _mydb
&quot;$@&quot;</p>

<p>This shows a completion function for a command mydb
which takes two command arguments, add and show. show takes
no arguments, while the arguments for add have already been
prepared in an array mydb_add_cmds, quite possibly by a
previous call to _regex_words.</p>

<p>_requested [ -x ] [ -12VJ ] tag [ name descr [ command
args ... ] ] This function is called to decide whether a tag
already regis- tered by a call to _tags (see below) has been
requested by the user and hence completion should be
performed for it. It returns status zero if the tag is
requested and non-zero other- wise. The function is
typically used as part of a loop over different tags as
follows:</p>

<p>_tags foo bar baz while _tags; do if _requested foo;
then ... # perform completion for foo fi ... # test the tags
bar and baz in the same way ... # exit loop if matches were
generated done</p>

<p>Note that the test for whether matches were generated is
not performed until the end of the _tags loop. This is so
that the user can set the tag-order style to specify a set
of tags to be completed at the same time.</p>

<p>If name and descr are given, _requested calls the
_description function with these arguments together with the
options passed to _requested.</p>

<p>If command is given, the _all_labels function will be
called immediately with the same arguments. In simple cases
this makes it possible to perform the test for the tag and
the matching in one go. For example:</p>

<p>local expl ret=1 _tags foo bar baz while _tags; do
_requested foo expl description compadd foobar foobaz
&amp;&amp; ret=0 ... (( ret )) || break done</p>

<p>If the command is not compadd, it must nevertheless be
prepared to handle the same options.</p>

<p>_retrieve_cache cache_identifier This function retrieves
completion information from the file given by
cache_identifier, stored in a directory specified by the
cache-path style which defaults to ~/.zcompcache. The return
status is zero if retrieval was successful. It will only
attempt retrieval if the use-cache style is set, so you can
call this function without worrying about whether the user
wanted to use the caching layer.</p>

<p>See _store_cache below for more details.</p>

<p>_sep_parts This function is passed alternating arrays
and separators as arguments. The arrays specify completions
for parts of strings to be separated by the separators. The
arrays may be the names of array parameters or a quoted list
of words in parentheses. For example, with the array
hosts=(ftp news) the call _sep_parts(foo bar) @ hosts will
complete the string f to foo and the string b@n to
bar@news.</p>

<p>This function accepts the compadd options -V, -J, -1,
-2, -n, -X, -M, -P, -S, -r, -R, and -q and passes them on to
the compadd builtin used to add the matches.</p>

<p>_setup tag [ group ] This function sets up the special
parameters used by the comple- tion system appropriately for
the tag given as the first argu- ment. It uses the styles
list-colors, list-packed, list-rows-first, last-prompt,
accept-exact, menu and force-list.</p>

<p>The optional group supplies the name of the group in
which the matches will be placed. If it is not given, the
tag is used as the group name.</p>

<p>This function is called automatically from _description
and hence is not normally called explicitly.</p>

<p>_store_cache cache_identifier params ... This function,
together with _retrieve_cache and _cache_invalid, implements
a caching layer which can be used in any completion
function. Data obtained by costly operations are stored in
parameters; this function then dumps the values of those
parame- ters to a file. The data can then be retrieved
quickly from that file via _retrieve_cache, even in
different instances of the shell.</p>

<p>The cache_identifier specifies the file which the data
should be dumped to. The file is stored in a directory
specified by the cache-path style which defaults to
~/.zcompcache. The remaining params arguments are the
parameters to dump to the file.</p>

<p>The return status is zero if storage was successful. The
func- tion will only attempt storage if the use-cache style
is set, so you can call this function without worrying about
whether the user wanted to use the caching layer.</p>

<p>The completion function may avoid calling
_retrieve_cache when it already has the completion data
available as parameters. However, in that case it should
call _cache_invalid to check whether the data in the
parameters and in the cache are still valid.</p>

<p>See the _perl_modules completion function for a simple
example of the usage of the caching layer.</p>

<p>_tags [ [ -C name ] tags ... ] If called with arguments,
these are taken to be the names of tags valid for
completions in the current context. These tags are stored
internally and sorted by using the tag-order style.</p>

<p>Next, _tags is called repeatedly without arguments from
the same completion function. This successively selects the
first, sec- ond, etc. set of tags requested by the user. The
return status is zero if at least one of the tags is
requested and non-zero otherwise. To test if a particular
tag is to be tried, the _requested function should be called
(see above).</p>

<p>If -C name is given, name is temporarily stored in the
argu- ment field (the fifth) of the context in the
curcontext parame- ter during the call to _tags; the field
is restored on exit. This allows _tags to use a more
specific context without having to change and reset the
curcontext parameter (which has the same effect).</p>

<p>_values [ -O name ] [ -s sep ] [ -S sep ] [ -wC ] desc
spec ... This is used to complete arbitrary keywords
(values) and their arguments, or lists of such
combinations.</p>

<p>If the first argument is the option -O name, it will be
used in the same way as by the _arguments function. In other
words, the elements of the name array will be passed to
compadd when executing an action.</p>

<p>If the first argument (or the first argument after -O
name) is -s, the next argument is used as the character that
separates multiple values. This character is automatically
added after each value in an auto-removable fashion (see
below); all values completed by _values -s appear in the
same word on the command line, unlike completion using
_arguments. If this option is not present, only a single
value will be completed per word.</p>

<p>Normally, _values will only use the current word to
determine which values are already present on the command
line and hence are not to be completed again. If the -w
option is given, other arguments are examined as well.</p>

<p>The first non-option argument is used as a string to
print as a description before listing the values.</p>

<p>All other arguments describe the possible values and
their argu- ments in the same format used for the
description of options by the _arguments function (see
above). The only differences are that no minus or plus sign
is required at the beginning, values can have only one
argument, and the forms of action beginning with an equal
sign are not supported.</p>

<p>The character separating a value from its argument can
be set using the option -S (like -s, followed by the
character to use as the separator in the next argument). By
default the equals sign will be used as the separator
between values and arguments.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>_values -s , description *foo[bar]
(two)*one[number]:first count: two[another number]::second
count:(1 2 3)</p>

<p>This describes three possible values: foo , one , and
two. The first is described as bar, takes no argument and
may appear more than once. The second is described as
number, may appear more than once, and takes one mandatory
argument described as first count; no action is specified,
so it will not be completed. The (two) at the beginning says
that if the value one is on the line, the value two will no
longer be considered a possible completion. Finally, the
last value (two) is described as another number and takes an
optional argument described as second count for which the
completions (to appear after an =) are 1, 2, and 3 . The
_values function will complete lists of these values
separated by com- mas.</p>

<p>Like _arguments, this function temporarily adds another
context name component to the arguments element (the fifth)
of the cur- rent context while executing the action. Here
this name is just the name of the value for which the
argument is completed.</p>

<p>The style verbose is used to decide if the descriptions
for the values (but not those for the arguments) should be
printed.</p>

<p>The associative array val_args is used to report values
and their arguments; this works similarly to the opt_args
associa- tive array used by _arguments. Hence the function
calling _val- ues should declare the local parameters state,
line, context and val_args:</p>

<p>local context state line typeset -A val_args</p>

<p>when using an action of the form -&gt;string . With this
function the context parameter will be set to the name of
the value whose argument is to be completed.</p>

<p>Note also that _values normally adds the character used
as the separator between values as an auto-removable suffix
(similar to a / after a directory). However, this is not
possible for a -&gt;string action as the matches for the
argument are generated by the calling function. To get the
usual behaviour, the the calling function can add the
separator x as a suffix by passing the options -qS x either
directly or indirectly to compadd.</p>

<p>The option -C is treated in the same way as it is by
_arguments. In that case the parameter curcontext should be
made local instead of context (as described above).</p>

<p>_wanted [ -x ] [ -C name ] [ -12VJ ] tag name descr
command args ... In many contexts, completion can only
generate one particular set of matches, usually
corresponding to a single tag. However, it is still
necessary to decide whether the user requires matches of
this type. This function is useful in such a case.</p>

<p>The arguments to _wanted are the same as those to
_requested, i.e. arguments to be passed to _description.
However, in this case the command is not optional; all the
processing of tags, including the loop over both tags and
tag labels and the genera- tion of matches, is carried out
automatically by _wanted.</p>

<p>Hence to offer only one tag and immediately add the
correspond- ing matches with the given description:</p>

<p>local expl _wanted tag expl description compadd
matches...</p>

<p>Note that, as for _requested, the command must be able
to accept options to be passed down to compadd.</p>

<p>Like _tags this function supports the -C option to give
a dif- ferent name for the argument context field. The -x
option has the same meaning as for _description.</p>

<p>COMPLETION DIRECTORIES In the source distribution, the
files are contained in various subdi- rectories of the
Completion directory. They may have been installed in the
same structure, or into one single function directory. The
follow- ing is a description of the files found in the
original directory structure. If you wish to alter an
installed file, you will need to copy it to some directory
which appears earlier in your fpath than the standard
directory where it appears.</p>

<p>Base The core functions and special completion widgets
automatically bound to keys. You will certainly need most of
these, though will probably not need to alter them. Many of
these are docu- mented above.</p>

<p>Zsh Functions for completing arguments of shell builtin
commands and utility functions for this. Some of these are
also used by functions from the Unix directory.</p>

<p>Unix Functions for completing arguments of external
commands and suites of commands. They may need modifying for
your system, although in many cases some attempt is made to
decide which ver- sion of a command is present. For example,
completion for the mount command tries to determine the
system it is running on, while completion for many other
utilities try to decide whether the GNU version of the
command is in use, and hence whether the --help option is
supported.</p>

<p>NAME zshcompctl - zsh programmable completion</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This version of zsh has two ways of
performing completion of words on the command line. New
users of the shell may prefer to use the newer and more
powerful system based on shell functions; this is described
in zshcompsys(1), and the basic shell mechanisms which
support it are described in zshcompwid(1). This manual entry
describes the older com- pctl command. compctl [ -CDT ]
options [ command ... ] compctl [ -CDT ] options [ -x
pattern options - ... -- ] [ + options [ -x ... -- ] ... [+]
] [ command ... ] compctl -M match-specs ... compctl -L [
-CDTM ] [ command ... ] compctl + command ...</p>

<p>Control the editors completion behavior according to the
supplied set of options. Various editing commands, notably
expand-or-complete-word, usually bound to tab, will attempt
to complete a word typed by the user, while others, notably
delete-char-or-list, usually bound to ^D in EMACS editing
mode, list the possibilities; compctl controls what those
possibilities are. They may for example be filenames (the
most common case, and hence the default), shell variables,
or words from a user-specified list.</p>

<p>COMMAND FLAGS Completion of the arguments of a command
may be different for each com- mand or may use the default.
The behavior when completing the command word itself may
also be separately specified. These correspond to the
following flags and arguments, all of which (except for -L)
may be com- bined with any combination of the options
described subsequently in the section Option Flags:</p>

<p>command ... controls completion for the named commands,
which must be listed last on the command line. If completion
is attempted for a com- mand with a pathname containing
slashes and no completion defi- nition is found, the search
is retried with the last pathname component. If the command
starts with a =, completion is tried with the pathname of
the command.</p>

<p>Any of the command strings may be patterns of the form
normally used for filename generation. These should be be
quoted to pro- tect them from immediate expansion; for
example the command string foo* arranges for completion of
the words of any com- mand beginning with foo. When
completion is attempted, all pat- tern completions are tried
in the reverse order of their defini- tion until one
matches. By default, completion then proceeds as normal,
i.e. the shell will try to generate more matches for the
specific command on the command line; this can be overridden
by including -tn in the flags for the pattern
completion.</p>

<p>Note that aliases are expanded before the command name
is deter- mined unless the COMPLETE_ALIASES option is set.
Commands may not be combined with the -C, -D or -T
flags.</p>

<p>-C controls completion when the command word itself is
being com- pleted. If no compctl -C command has been issued,
the names of any executable command (whether in the path or
specific to the shell, such as aliases or functions) are
completed.</p>

<p>-D controls default completion behavior for the
arguments of com- mands not assigned any special behavior.
If no compctl -D com- mand has been issued, filenames are
completed.</p>

<p>-T supplies completion flags to be used before any other
processing is done, even before processing for compctls
defined for spe- cific commands. This is especially useful
when combined with extended completion (the -x flag, see the
section Extended Com- pletion below). Using this flag you
can define default behav- ior which will apply to all
commands without exception, or you can alter the standard
behavior for all commands. For example, if your access to
the user database is too slow and/or it con- tains too many
users (so that completion after ~ is too slow to be usable),
you can use</p>

<p>compctl -T -xs[~] C[0,[^/]#]-k friends -S/ -tn</p>

<p>to complete the strings in the array friends after a ~.
The C[...] argument is necessary so that this form of
~-completion is not tried after the directory name is
finished.</p>

<p>-L lists the existing completion behavior in a manner
suitable for putting into a start-up script; the existing
behavior is not changed. Any combination of the above forms,
or the -M flag (which must follow the -L flag), may be
specified, otherwise all defined completions are listed. Any
other flags supplied are ignored.</p>

<p>no argument If no argument is given, compctl lists all
defined completions in an abbreviated form; with a list of
options, all completions with those flags set (not counting
extended completion) are listed.</p>

<p>If the + flag is alone and followed immediately by the
command list, the completion behavior for all the commands
in the list is reset to the default. In other words,
completion will subsequently use the options specified by
the -D flag.</p>

<p>The form with -M as the first and only option defines
global matching specifications (see zshcompwid). The match
specifications given will be used for every completion
attempt (only when using compctl, not with the new
completion system) and are tried in the order in which they
are defined until one generates at least one match.
E.g.:</p>

<p>compctl -m:{a-zA-Z}={A-Za-z}</p>

<p>This will first try completion without any global match
specifications (the empty string) and, if that generates no
matches, will try case insensitive completion.</p>

<p>OPTION FLAGS [ -fcFBdeaRGovNAIOPZEnbjrzu/12 ] [ -k array

<p>The remaining options specify the type of command
arguments to look for during completion. Any combination of
these flags may be specified; the result is a sorted list of
all the possibilities. The options are as follows.</p>

<p>Simple Flags These produce completion lists made up by
the shell itself:</p>

<p>-f Filenames and filesystem paths.</p>

<p>-/ Just filesystem paths.</p>

<p>-c Command names, including aliases, shell functions,
builtins and reserved words.</p>

<p>-F Function names.</p>

<p>-B Names of builtin commands.</p>

<p>-m Names of external commands.</p>

<p>-w Reserved words.</p>

<p>-a Alias names.</p>

<p>-R Names of regular (non-global) aliases.</p>

<p>-G Names of global aliases.</p>

<p>-d This can be combined with -F, -B, -w, -a, -R and -G
to get names of disabled functions, builtins, reserved words
or aliases.</p>

<p>-e This option (to show enabled commands) is in effect
by default, but may be combined with -d; -de in combination
with -F, -B, -w, -a, -R and -G will complete names of
functions, builtins, reserved words or aliases whether or
not they are disabled.</p>

<p>-o Names of shell options (see zshoptions(1)).</p>

<p>-v Names of any variable defined in the shell.</p>

<p>-N Names of scalar (non-array) parameters.</p>

<p>-A Array names.</p>

<p>-I Names of integer variables.</p>

<p>-O Names of read-only variables.</p>

<p>-p Names of parameters used by the shell (including
special parame- ters).</p>

<p>-Z Names of shell special parameters.</p>

<p>-E Names of environment variables.</p>

<p>-n Named directories.</p>

<p>-b Key binding names.</p>

<p>-j Job names: the first word of the job leaders command
line. This is useful with the kill builtin.</p>

<p>-r Names of running jobs.</p>

<p>-z Names of suspended jobs.</p>

<p>-u User names.</p>

<p>Flags with Arguments These have user supplied arguments
to determine how the list of comple- tions is to be made
up:</p>

<p>-k array Names taken from the elements of $array (note
that the $ does not appear on the command line).
Alternatively, the argument array itself may be a set of
space- or comma-separated values in parentheses, in which
any delimiter may be escaped with a back- slash; in this
case the argument should be quoted. For example,</p>

<p>compctl -k &quot;(cputime filesize datasize stacksize
coredumpsize resident descriptors)&quot; limit</p>

<p>-g globstring The globstring is expanded using filename
globbing; it should be quoted to protect it from immediate
expansion. The resulting filenames are taken as the possible
completions. Use *(/) instead of */ for directories. The
fignore special parameter is not applied to the resulting
files. More than one pattern may be given separated by
blanks. (Note that brace expansion is not part of globbing.
Use the syntax (either|or) to match alternatives.)</p>

<p>-s subststring The subststring is split into words and
these words are than expanded using all shell expansion
mechanisms (see zshexpn(1)). The resulting words are taken
as possible completions. The fig- nore special parameter is
not applied to the resulting files. Note that -g is faster
for filenames.</p>

<p>-K function Call the given function to get the
completions. Unless the name starts with an underscore, the
function is passed two arguments: the prefix and the suffix
of the word on which completion is to be attempted, in other
words those characters before the cursor position, and those
from the cursor position onwards. The whole command line can
be accessed with the -c and -l flags of the read builtin.
The function should set the variable reply to an array
containing the completions (one completion per element);
note that reply should not be made local to the function.
From such a function the command line can be accessed with
the -c and -l flags to the read builtin. For example,</p>

<p>function whoson { reply=user); } compctl -K whoson
talk</p>

<p>completes only logged-on users after talk. Note that
whoson must return an array, so reply= users would be
incorrect.</p>

<p>-H num pattern The possible completions are taken from
the last num history lines. Only words matching pattern are
taken. If num is zero or negative the whole history is
searched and if pattern is the empty string all words are
taken (as with *). A typical use is</p>

<p>compctl -D -f + -H 0</p>

<p>which forces completion to look back in the history list
for a word if no filename matches.</p>

<p>Control Flags These do not directly specify types of
name to be completed, but manip- ulate the options that
do:</p>

<p>-Q This instructs the shell not to quote any
metacharacters in the possible completions. Normally the
results of a completion are inserted into the command line
with any metacharacters quoted so that they are interpreted
as normal characters. This is appro- priate for filenames
and ordinary strings. However, for special effects, such as
inserting a backquoted expression from a com- pletion array
(-k) so that the expression will not be evaluated until the
complete line is executed, this option must be used.</p>

<p>-P prefix The prefix is inserted just before the
completed string; any initial part already typed will be
completed and the whole pre- fix ignored for completion
purposes. For example,</p>

<p>compctl -j -P &quot;%&quot; kill</p>

<p>inserts a % after the kill command and then completes
job names.</p>

<p>-S suffix When a completion is found the suffix is
inserted after the com- pleted string. In the case of menu
completion the suffix is inserted immediately, but it is
still possible to cycle through the list of completions by
repeatedly hitting the same key.</p>

<p>-W file-prefix With directory file-prefix: for command,
file, directory and globbing completion (options -c, -f, -/,
-g), the file prefix is implicitly added in front of the
completion. For example,</p>

<p>compctl -/ -W ~/Mail maildirs</p>

<p>completes any subdirectories to any depth beneath the
directory ~/Mail, although that prefix does not appear on
the command line. The file-prefix may also be of the form
accepted by the -k flag, i.e. the name of an array or a
literal list in paren- thesis. In this case all the
directories in the list will be searched for possible
completions.</p>

<p>-q If used with a suffix as specified by the -S option,
this causes the suffix to be removed if the next character
typed is a blank or does not insert anything or if the
suffix consists of only one character and the next character
typed is the same charac- ter; this the same rule used for
the AUTO_REMOVE_SLASH option. The option is most useful for
list separators (comma, colon, etc.).</p>

<p>-l cmd This option restricts the range of command line
words that are considered to be arguments. If combined with
one of the extended completion patterns p[...], r[...], or
R[...] (see the section Extended Completion below) the range
is restricted to the range of arguments specified in the
brackets. Completion is then performed as if these had been
given as argu- ments to the cmd supplied with the option. If
the cmd string is empty the first word in the range is
instead taken as the com- mand name, and command name
completion performed on the first word in the range. For
example,</p>

<p>compctl -xr[-exec,;]-l-- find</p>

<p>completes arguments between -exec and the following ;
(or the end of the command line if there is no such string)
as if they were a separate command line.</p>

<p>-h cmd Normally zsh completes quoted strings as a whole.
With this option, completion can be done separately on
different parts of such strings. It works like the -l option
but makes the comple- tion code work on the parts of the
current word that are sepa- rated by spaces. These parts are
completed as if they were argu- ments to the given cmd. If
cmd is the empty string, the first part is completed as a
command name, as with -l.</p>

<p>-U Use the whole list of possible completions, whether
or not they actually match the word on the command line. The
word typed so far will be deleted. This is most useful with
a function (given by the -K option) which can examine the
word components passed to it (or via the read builtins -c
and -l flags) and use its own criteria to decide what
matches. If there is no completion, the original word is
retained. Since the produced possible com- pletions seldom
have interesting common prefixes and suffixes, menu
completion is started immediately if AUTO_MENU is set and
this flag is used.</p>

<p>-y func-or-var The list provided by func-or-var is
displayed instead of the list of completions whenever a
listing is required; the actual completions to be inserted
are not affected. It can be provided in two ways. Firstly,
if func-or-var begins with a $ it defines a variable, or if
it begins with a left parenthesis a literal array, which
contains the list. A variable may have been set by a call to
a function using the -K option. Otherwise it contains the
name of a function which will be executed to create the
list. The function will be passed as an argument list all
matching completions, including prefixes and suffixes
expanded in full, and should set the array reply to the
result. In both cases, the display list will only be
retrieved after a complete list of matches has been
created.</p>

<p>Note that the returned list does not have to correspond,
even in length, to the original set of matches, and may be
passed as a scalar instead of an array. No special
formatting of characters is performed on the output in this
case; in particular, newlines are printed literally and if
they appear output in columns is suppressed.</p>

<p>-X explanation Print explanation when trying completion
on the current set of options. A %n in this string is
replaced by the number of matches that were added for this
explanation string. The expla- nation only appears if
completion was tried and there was no unique match, or when
listing completions. Explanation strings will be listed
together with the matches of the group specified together
with the -X option (using the -J or -V option). If the same
explanation string is given to multiple -X options, the
string appears only once (for each group) and the number of
matches shown for the %n is the total number of all matches
for each of these uses. In any case, the explanation string
will only be shown if there was at least one match added for
the explanation string.</p>

<p>The sequences %B, %b, %S, %s, %U, and %u specify output
attributes (bold, standout, and underline), %F, %f, %K, %k
spec- ify foreground and background colours, and %{...%} can
be used to include literal escape sequences as in
prompts.</p>

<p>-Y explanation Identical to -X, except that the
explanation first undergoes expansion following the usual
rules for strings in double quotes. The expansion will be
carried out after any functions are called for the -K or -y
options, allowing them to set vari- ables.</p>

<p>-t continue The continue-string contains a character
that specifies which set of completion flags should be used
next. It is useful:</p>

<p>(i) With -T, or when trying a list of pattern
completions, when compctl would usually continue with
ordinary processing after finding matches; this can be
suppressed with -tn.</p>

<p>(ii) With a list of alternatives separated by +, when
compctl would normally stop when one of the alternatives
generates matches. It can be forced to consider the next set
of comple- tions by adding -t+ to the flags of the
alternative before the +.</p>

<p>(iii) In an extended completion list (see below), when
compctl would normally continue until a set of conditions
succeeded, then use only the immediately following flags.
With -t-, com- pctl will continue trying extended
completions after the next - ; with -tx it will attempt
completion with the default flags, in other words those
before the -x.</p>

<p>-J name This gives the name of the group the matches
should be placed in. Groups are listed and sorted
separately; likewise, menu com- pletion will offer the
matches in the groups in the order in which the groups were
defined. If no group name is explicitly given, the matches
are stored in a group named default. The first time a group
name is encountered, a group with that name is created.
After that all matches with the same group name are stored
in that group.</p>

<p>This can be useful with non-exclusive alternative
completions. For example, in</p>

<p>compctl -f -J files -t+ + -v -J variables foo</p>

<p>both files and variables are possible completions, as
the -t+ forces both sets of alternatives before and after
the + to be considered at once. Because of the -J options,
however, all files are listed before all variables.</p>

<p>-V name Like -J, but matches within the group will not
be sorted in listings nor in menu completion. These unsorted
groups are in a different name space from the sorted ones,
so groups defined as -J files and -V files are distinct.</p>

<p>-1 If given together with the -V option, makes only
consecutive duplicates in the group be removed. Note that
groups with and without this flag are in different name
spaces.</p>

<p>-2 If given together with the -J or -V option, makes all
duplicates be kept. Again, groups with and without this flag
are in differ- ent name spaces.</p>

<p>-M match-spec This defines additional matching control
specifications that should be used only when testing words
for the list of flags this flag appears in. The format of
the match-spec string is described in zshcompwid.</p>

<p>ALTERNATIVE COMPLETION compctl [ -CDT ] options +
options [ + ... ] [ + ] command ...</p>

<p>The form with + specifies alternative options.
Completion is tried with the options before the first +. If
this produces no matches com- pletion is tried with the
flags after the + and so on. If there are no flags after the
last + and a match has not been found up to that point,
default completion is tried. If the list of flags contains a
-t with a + character, the next list of flags is used even
if the current list produced matches.</p>

<p>Additional options are available that restrict
completion to some part of the command line; this is
referred to as extended completion.</p>

<p>EXTENDED COMPLETION compctl [ -CDT ] options -x pattern
options - ... -- [ command ... ] compctl [ -CDT ] options [
-x pattern options - ... -- ] [ + options [ -x ... -- ] ...
[+] ] [ command ... ]</p>

<p>The form with -x specifies extended completion for the
commands given; as shown, it may be combined with
alternative completion using +. Each pattern is examined in
turn; when a match is found, the cor- responding options, as
described in the section Option Flags above, are used to
generate possible completions. If no pattern matches, the
options given before the -x are used.</p>

<p>Note that each pattern should be supplied as a single
argument and should be quoted to prevent expansion of
metacharacters by the shell.</p>

<p>A pattern is built of sub-patterns separated by commas;
it matches if at least one of these sub-patterns matches
(they are ored). These sub-patterns are in turn composed of
other sub-patterns separated by white spaces which match if
all of the sub-patterns match (they are and ed). An element
of the sub-patterns is of the form c[...][...], where the
pairs of brackets may be repeated as often as necessary, and
matches if any of the sets of brackets match (an or). The
example below makes this clearer.</p>

<p>The elements may be any of the following:</p>

<p>s[string]... Matches if the current word on the command
line starts with one of the strings given in brackets. The
string is not removed and is not part of the completion.</p>

<p>S[string]... Like s[string] except that the string is
part of the completion.</p>

<p>p[from,to]... Matches if the number of the current word
is between one of the from and to pairs inclusive. The comma
and to are optional; to defaults to the same value as from.
The numbers may be nega- tive: -n refers to the nth last
word on the line.</p>

<p>c[offset,string]... Matches if the string matches the
word offset by offset from the current word position.
Usually offset will be negative.</p>

<p>C[offset,pattern]... Like c but using pattern matching
instead.</p>

<p>w[index,string]... Matches if the word in position index
is equal to the corre- sponding string. Note that the word
count is made after any alias expansion.</p>

<p>W[index,pattern]... Like w but using pattern matching
instead.</p>

<p>n[index,string]... Matches if the current word contains
string. Anything up to and including the indexth occurrence
of this string will not be con- sidered part of the
completion, but the rest will. index may be negative to
count from the end: in most cases, index will be 1 or -1.
For example,</p>

<p>compctl -user-xn[1,@]-k hosts -- talk</p>

<p>will usually complete usernames, but if you insert an @
after the name, names from the array hosts (assumed to
contain host- names, though you must make the array
yourself) will be com- pleted. Other commands such as rcp
can be handled similarly.</p>

<p>N[index,string]... Like n except that the string will be
taken as a character class. Anything up to and including the
indexth occurrence of any of the characters in string will
not be considered part of the completion.</p>

<p>m[min,max]... Matches if the total number of words lies
between min and max inclusive.</p>

<p>r[str1,str2]... Matches if the cursor is after a word
with prefix str1. If there is also a word with prefix str2
on the command line after the one matched by str1 it matches
only if the cursor is before this word. If the comma and
str2 are omitted, it matches if the cursor is after a word
with prefix str1.</p>

<p>R[str1,str2]... Like r but using pattern matching
instead.</p>

<p>q[str]... Matches the word currently being completed is
in single quotes and the str begins with the letter s, or if
completion is done in double quotes and str starts with the
letter d, or if com- pletion is done in backticks and str
starts with a b.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE compctl -u -xs[+] c[-1,-f],s[-f+] -g
~/Mail/*(:t)-s[-f],c[-1,-f]-f -- mail</p>

<p>This is to be interpreted as follows:</p>

<p>If the current command is mail, then</p>

<p>if ((the current word begins with + and the previous
word is -f) or (the current word begins with -f+)), then
complete the non-directory part (the :t glob modifier) of
files in the directory ~/Mail; else</p>

<p>if the current word begins with -f or the previous word
was -f, then complete any file; else</p>

<p>complete user names.</p>

<p>ZSHMODULES(1) ZSHMODULES(1)</p>

<p>NAME zshmodules - zsh loadable modules</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Some optional parts of zsh are in modules,
separate from the core of the shell. Each of these modules

<p>zsh/zpty A builtin for starting a command in a
pseudo-terminal.</p>

<p>zsh/zselect Block and return when file descriptors are
ready.</p>

<p>zsh/zutil Some utility builtins, e.g. the one for
supporting configuration via styles.</p>

<p>THE ZSH/ATTR MODULE The zsh/attr module is used for
manipulating extended attributes. The builtins in this
module are:</p>

<p>zgetattr filename attribute [ parameter ] Get the
extended attribute attribute from the specified file- name.
If the optional argument parameter is given, the attribute
is set on that parameter instead of being printed to
stdout.</p>

<p>zsetattr filename attribute value Set the extended
attribute attribute on the specified filename to value.</p>

<p>zdelattr filename attribute Remove the extended
attribute attribute from the specified file- name.</p>

<p>zlistattr filename [ parameter ] List the extended
attributes currently set on the specified filename. If the
optional argument parameter is given, the list of attributes
is set on that parameter instead of being printed to
stdout.</p>

<p>THE ZSH/CAP MODULE The zsh/cap module is used for
manipulating POSIX.1e (POSIX.6) capabil- ity sets. If the
operating system does not support this interface, the
builtins defined by this module will do nothing. The
builtins in this module are:</p>

<p>cap [ capabilities ] Change the shells process
capability sets to the specified capabilities, otherwise
display the shell s current capabili- ties.</p>

<p>getcap filename ... This is a built-in implementation of
the POSIX standard utility. It displays the capability sets
on each specified filename.</p>

<p>setcap capabilities filename ... This is a built-in
implementation of the POSIX standard utility. It sets the
capability sets on each specified filename to the specified
capabilities.</p>

<p>THE ZSH/CLONE MODULE The zsh/clone module makes
available one builtin command:</p>

<p>clone tty Creates a forked instance of the current
shell, attached to the specified tty. In the new shell, the
PID, PPID and TTY special parameters are changed
appropriately. $! is set to zero in the new shell, and to
the new shell s PID in the original shell.</p>

<p>The return status of the builtin is zero in both shells
if suc- cessful, and non-zero on error.</p>

<p>The target of clone should be an unused terminal, such
as an unused virtual console or a virtual terminal created
by</p>

<p>xterm -e sh -c trap : INT QUIT TSTP; tty; while :; do
sleep 100000000; done</p>

<p>Some words of explanation are warranted about this long
xterm command line: when doing clone on a pseudo-terminal,
some other session (&quot;session&quot; meant as a unix
session group, or SID) is already owning the terminal. Hence
the cloned zsh cannot acquire the pseudo-terminal as a
controlling tty. That means two things:</p>

<p>the job control signals will go to the
sh-started-by-xterm pro- cess group (thats why we disable
INT QUIT and TSTP with trap; otherwise the while loop could
get suspended or killed)</p>

<p>the cloned shell will have job control disabled, and the
job control keys (control-C, control- and control-Z) will
not work.</p>

<p>This does not apply when cloning to an unused vc.</p>

<p>Cloning to an used (and unprepared) terminal will result
in two processes reading simultaneously from the same
terminal, with input bytes going randomly to either
process.</p>

<p>clone is mostly useful as a shell built-in replacement
for openvt.</p>

<p>THE ZSH/COMPCTL MODULE The zsh/compctl module makes
available two builtin commands. compctl, is the old,
deprecated way to control completions for ZLE. See zshcom-
pctl(1). The other builtin command, compcall can be used in
user-defined completion widgets, see zshcompwid(1).</p>

<p>THE ZSH/COMPLETE MODULE The zsh/complete module makes
available several builtin commands which can be used in
user-defined completion widgets, see zshcompwid(1).</p>

<p>THE ZSH/COMPLIST MODULE The zsh/complist module offers
three extensions to completion listings: the ability to
highlight matches in such a list, the ability to scroll
through long lists and a different style of menu
completion.</p>

<p>Colored completion listings Whenever one of the
parameters ZLS_COLORS or ZLS_COLOURS is set and the
zsh/complist module is loaded or linked into the shell,
completion lists will be colored. Note, however, that
complist will not automati- cally be loaded if it is not
linked in: on systems with dynamic load- ing, zmodload
zsh/complist is required.</p>

<p>The parameters ZLS_COLORS and ZLS_COLOURS describe how
matches are highlighted. To turn on highlighting an empty
value suffices, in which case all the default values given
below will be used. The format of the value of these
parameters is the same as used by the GNU version of the ls
command: a colon-separated list of specifications of the
form name=value . The name may be one of the following
strings, most of which specify file types for which the
value will be used. The strings and their default values
are:</p>

<p>no 0 for normal text (i.e. when displaying something
other than a matched file)</p>

<p>fi 0 for regular files</p>

<p>di 32 for directories</p>

<p>ln 36 for symbolic links. If this has the special value
target, sym- bolic links are dereferenced and the target
file used to deter- mine the display format.</p>

<p>pi 31 for named pipes (FIFOs)</p>

<p>so 33 for sockets</p>

<p>bd 44;37 for block devices</p>

<p>cd 44;37 for character devices</p>

<p>or none for a symlink to nonexistent file (default is
the value defined for ln)</p>

<p>mi none for a non-existent file (default is the value
defined for fi); this code is currently not used</p>

<p>su 37;41 for files with setuid bit set</p>

<p>sg 30;43 for files with setgid bit set</p>

<p>tw 30;42 for world writable directories with sticky bit
set</p>

<p>ow 34;43 for world writable directories without sticky
bit set</p>

<p>st 37;44 for directories with sticky bit set but not
world writable</p>

<p>ex 35 for executable files</p>

<p>lce[ for the left code (see below)</p>

<p>rc m for the right code</p>

<p>tc 0 for the character indicating the file type printed
after file- names if the LIST_TYPES option is set</p>

<p>sp 0 for the spaces printed after matches to align the
next column</p>

<p>ec none for the end code</p>

<p>Apart from these strings, the name may also be an
asterisk (*) fol- lowed by any string. The value given for
such a string will be used for all files whose name ends
with the string. The name may also be an equals sign (=)
followed by a pattern; the EXTENDED_GLOB option will be
turned on for evaluation of the pattern. The value given for
this pattern will be used for all matches (not just
filenames) whose display string are matched by the pattern.
Definitions for the form with the leading equal sign take
precedence over the values defined for file types, which in
turn take precedence over the form with the leading asterisk
(file extensions).</p>

<p>The leading-equals form also allows different parts of
the displayed strings to be colored differently. For this,
the pattern has to use the (#b) globbing flag and pairs of
parentheses surrounding the parts of the strings that are to
be colored differently. In this case the value may consist
of more than one color code separated by equal signs. The
first code will be used for all parts for which no explicit
code is specified and the following codes will be used for
the parts matched by the sub-patterns in parentheses. For
example, the specification =(#b)(?)*(?)=0=3=7 will be used
for all matches which are at least two characters long and
will use the code 3 for the first character, 7 for the last
character and 0 for the rest.</p>

<p>All three forms of name may be preceded by a pattern in
parentheses. If this is given, the value will be used only
for matches in groups whose names are matched by the pattern
given in the parentheses. For example, (g*)m*=43 highlights
all matches beginning with m in groups whose names begin
with g using the color code 43. In case of the lc, rc, and
ec codes, the group pattern is ignored.</p>

<p>Note also that all patterns are tried in the order in
which they appear in the parameter value until the first one
matches which is then used.</p>

<p>When printing a match, the code prints the value of lc,
the value for the file-type or the last matching
specification with a * , the value of rc, the string to
display for the match itself, and then the value of ec if
that is defined or the values of lc, no, and rc if ec is not
defined.</p>

<p>The default values are ISO 6429 (ANSI) compliant and can
be used on vt100 compatible terminals such as xterms. On
monochrome terminals the default values will have no visible
effect. The colors function from the contribution can be
used to get associative arrays containing the codes for ANSI
terminals (see the section Other Functions in zshcon-
trib(1)). For example, after loading colors, one could use
$col- ors[red] to get the code for foreground color red and
$col- ors[bg-green] for the code for background color
green.</p>

<p>If the completion system invoked by compinit is used,
these parameters should not be set directly because the
system controls them itself. Instead, the list-colors style
should be used (see the section Comple- tion System
Configuration in zshcompsys(1)).</p>

<p>Scrolling in completion listings To enable scrolling
through a completion list, the LISTPROMPT parameter must be
set. Its value will be used as the prompt; if it is the
empty string, a default prompt will be used. The value may
contain escapes of the form %x. It supports the escapes %B,
%b, %S , %s, %U, %u, %F, %f, %K, %k and %{...%} used also in
shell prompts as well as three pairs of additional
sequences: a %l or %L is replaced by the number of the last
line shown and the total number of lines in the form
number/total ; a %m or %M is replaced with the number of the
last match shown and the total number of matches; and %p or
%P is replaced with Top, Bottom or the position of the first
line shown in percent of the total number of lines,
respectively. In each of these cases the form with the
uppercase letter will be replaced with a string of fixed
width, padded to the right with spaces, while the lowercase
form will not be padded.</p>

<p>If the parameter LISTPROMPT is set, the completion code
will not ask if the list should be shown. Instead it
immediately starts displaying the list, stopping after the
first screenful, showing the prompt at the bottom, waiting
for a keypress after temporarily switching to the listscroll
keymap. Some of the zle functions have a special meaning
while scrolling lists:</p>

<p>send-break stops listing discarding the key pressed</p>

<p>accept-line, down-history, down-line-or-history
down-line-or-search, vi-down-line-or-history scrolls forward
one line</p>

<p>complete-word, menu-complete, expand-or-complete
expand-or-complete-prefix, menu-complete-or-expand scrolls
forward one screenful</p>

<p>Every other character stops listing and immediately
processes the key as usual. Any key that is not bound in the
listscroll keymap or that is bound to undefined-key is
looked up in the keymap currently selected.</p>

<p>As for the ZLS_COLORS and ZLS_COLOURS parameters,
LISTPROMPT should not be set directly when using the shell
function based completion system. Instead, the list-prompt
style should be used.</p>

<p>Menu selection The zsh/complist module also offers an
alternative style of selecting matches from a list, called
menu selection, which can be used if the shell is set up to
return to the last prompt after showing a completion list
(see the ALWAYS_LAST_PROMPT option in zshoptions(1)).</p>

<p>Menu selection can be invoked directly by the widget
menu-select defined by this module. This is a standard ZLE
widget that can be bound to a key in the usual way as
described in zshzle(1).</p>

<p>Alternatively, the parameter MENUSELECT can be set to an
integer, which gives the minimum number of matches that must
be present before menu selection is automatically turned on.
This second method requires that menu completion be started,
either directly from a widget such as menu-complete, or due
to one of the options MENU_COMPLETE or AUTO_MENU being set.
If MENUSELECT is set, but is 0, 1 or empty, menu selection
will always be started during an ambiguous menu
completion.</p>

<p>When using the completion system based on shell
functions, the MENUSE- LECT parameter should not be used
(like the ZLS_COLORS and ZLS_COLOURS parameters described
above). Instead, the menu style should be used with the
select=... keyword.</p>

<p>After menu selection is started, the matches will be
listed. If there are more matches than fit on the screen,
only the first screenful is shown. The matches to insert
into the command line can be selected from this list. In the
list one match is highlighted using the value for ma from
the ZLS_COLORS or ZLS_COLOURS parameter. The default value
for this is 7 which forces the selected match to be
highlighted using standout mode on a vt100-compatible
terminal. If neither ZLS_COLORS nor ZLS_COLOURS is set, the
same terminal control sequence as for the %S escape in
prompts is used.</p>

<p>If there are more matches than fit on the screen and the
parameter MENUPROMPT is set, its value will be shown below
the matches. It sup- ports the same escape sequences as
LISTPROMPT, but the number of the match or line shown will
be that of the one where the mark is placed. If its value is
the empty string, a default prompt will be used.</p>

<p>The MENUSCROLL parameter can be used to specify how the
list is scrolled. If the parameter is unset, this is done
line by line, if it is set to 0 (zero), the list will scroll
half the number of lines of the screen. If the value is
positive, it gives the number of lines to scroll and if it
is negative, the list will be scrolled the number of lines
of the screen minus the (absolute) value.</p>

<p>As for the ZLS_COLORS, ZLS_COLOURS and LISTPROMPT
parameters, neither MENUPROMPT nor MENUSCROLL should be set
directly when using the shell function based completion
system. Instead, the select-prompt and select-scroll styles
should be used.</p>

<p>The completion code sometimes decides not to show all of
the matches in the list. These hidden matches are either
matches for which the com- pletion function which added them
explicitly requested that they not appear in the list (using
the -n option of the compadd builtin command) or they are
matches which duplicate a string already in the list
(because they differ only in things like prefixes or
suffixes that are not displayed). In the list used for menu
selection, however, even these matches are shown so that it
is possible to select them. To highlight such matches the hi
and du capabilities in the ZLS_COLORS and ZLS_COLOURS
parameters are supported for hidden matches of the first and
second kind, respectively.</p>

<p>Selecting matches is done by moving the mark around
using the zle move- ment functions. When not all matches can
be shown on the screen at the same time, the list will
scroll up and down when crossing the top or bottom line. The
following zle functions have special meaning during menu
selection:</p>

<p>accept-line accepts the current match and leaves menu
selection</p>

<p>send-break leaves menu selection and restores the
previous contents of the command line</p>

<p>redisplay, clear-screen execute their normal function
without leaving menu selection</p>

<p>accept-and-hold, accept-and-menu-complete accept the
currently inserted match and continue selection allowing to
select the next match to insert into the line</p>

<p>accept-and-infer-next-history accepts the current match
and then tries completion with menu selection again; in the
case of files this allows one to select a directory and
immediately attempt to complete files in it; if there are no
matches, a message is shown and one can use undo to go back
to completion on the previous level, every other key leaves
menu selection (including the other zle functions which are
otherwise special during menu selection)</p>

<p>undo removes matches inserted during the menu selection
by one of the three functions before</p>

<p>down-history, down-line-or-history
vi-down-line-or-history, down-line-or-search moves the mark
one line down</p>

<p>up-history, up-line-or-history vi-up-line-or-history,
up-line-or-search moves the mark one line up</p>

<p>forward-char, vi-forward-char moves the mark one column
right</p>

<p>backward-char, vi-backward-char moves the mark one
column left</p>

<p>forward-word, vi-forward-word vi-forward-word-end,
emacs-forward-word moves the mark one screenful down</p>

<p>backward-word, vi-backward-word, emacs-backward-word
moves the mark one screenful up</p>

<p>vi-forward-blank-word, vi-forward-blank-word-end moves
the mark to the first line of the next group of matches</p>

<p>vi-backward-blank-word moves the mark to the last line
of the previous group of matches</p>

<p>beginning-of-history moves the mark to the first
line</p>

<p>end-of-history moves the mark to the last line</p>

<p>beginning-of-buffer-or-history, beginning-of-line
beginning-of-line-hist, vi-beginning-of-line moves the mark
to the leftmost column</p>

<p>end-of-buffer-or-history, end-of-line end-of-line-hist,
vi-end-of-line moves the mark to the rightmost column</p>

<p>complete-word, menu-complete, expand-or-complete
expand-or-complete-prefix, menu-expand-or-complete moves the
mark to the next match</p>

<p>reverse-menu-complete moves the mark to the previous
match</p>

<p>vi-insert this toggles between normal and interactive
mode; in interactive mode the keys bound to self-insert and
self-insert-unmeta insert into the command line as in normal
editing mode but without leaving menu selection; after each
character completion is tried again and the list changes to
contain only the new matches; the completion widgets make
the longest unambiguous string be inserted in the command
line and undo and backward-delete-char go back to the
previous set of matches</p>

<p>history-incremental-search-forward,
history-incremental-search-backward this starts incremental
searches in the list of completions displayed; in this mode,
accept-line only leaves incremental search, going back to
the normal menu selection mode</p>

<p>All movement functions wrap around at the edges; any
other zle function not listed leaves menu selection and
executes that function. It is possible to make widgets in
the above list do the same by using the form of the widget
with a . in front. For example, the widget .accept-line has
the effect of leaving menu selection and accepting the
entire command line.</p>

<p>During this selection the widget uses the keymap
menuselect. Any key that is not defined in this keymap or
that is bound to undefined-key is looked up in the keymap
currently selected. This is used to ensure that the most
important keys used during selection (namely the cursor
keys, return, and TAB) have sensible defaults. However, keys
in the menuselect keymap can be modified directly using the
bindkey builtin command (see zshmodules(1)). For example, to
make the return key leave menu selection without accepting
the match currently selected one could call</p>

<p>bindkey -M menuselect^Msend-break</p>

<p>after loading the zsh/complist module.</p>

<p>THE ZSH/COMPUTIL MODULE The zsh/computil module adds
several builtin commands that are used by some of the
completion functions in the completion system based on shell
functions (see zshcompsys(1) ). Except for compquote these
builtin commands are very specialised and thus not very
interesting when writing your own completion functions. In
summary, these builtin commands are:</p>

<p>comparguments This is used by the _arguments function to
do the argument and command line parsing. Like compdescribe
it has an option -i to do the parsing and initialize some
internal state and various options to access the state
information to decide what should be completed.</p>

<p>compdescribe This is used by the _describe function to
build the displays for the matches and to get the strings to
add as matches with their options. On the first call one of
the options -i or -I should be supplied as the first
argument. In the first case, display strings without the
descriptions will be generated, in the sec- ond case, the
string used to separate the matches from their descriptions
must be given as the second argument and the descriptions
(if any) will be shown. All other arguments are like the
definition arguments to _describe itself.</p>

<p>Once compdescribe has been called with either the -i or
the -I option, it can be repeatedly called with the -g
option and the names of five arrays as its arguments. This
will step through the different sets of matches and store
the options in the first array, the strings with
descriptions in the second, the matches for these in the
third, the strings without descriptions in the fourth, and
the matches for them in the fifth array. These are then
directly given to compadd to register the matches with the
completion code.</p>

<p>compfiles Used by the _path_files function to optimize
complex recursive filename generation (globbing). It does
three things. With the -p and -P options it builds the glob
patterns to use, including the paths already handled and
trying to optimize the patterns with respect to the prefix
and suffix from the line and the match specification
currently used. The -i option does the directory tests for
the ignore-parents style and the -r option tests if a
component for some of the matches are equal to the string on
the line and removes all other matches if that is true.</p>

<p>compgroups Used by the _tags function to implement the
internals of the group-order style. This only takes its
arguments as names of completion groups and creates the
groups for it (all six types: sorted and unsorted, both
without removing duplicates, with removing all duplicates
and with removing consecutive dupli- cates).</p>

<p>compquote [ -p ] names ... There may be reasons to write
completion functions that have to add the matches using the
-Q option to compadd and perform quot- ing themselves.
Instead of interpreting the first character of the
all_quotes key of the compstate special association and
using the q flag for parameter expansions, one can use this
builtin command. The arguments are the names of scalar or
array parameters and the values of these parameters are
quoted as needed for the innermost quoting level. If the -p
option is given, quoting is done as if there is some prefix
before the values of the parameters, so that a leading equal
sign will not be quoted.</p>

<p>The return status is non-zero in case of an error and
zero oth- erwise.</p>

<p>comptags comptry These implement the internals of the
tags mechanism.</p>

<p>compvalues Like comparguments, but for the _values
function.</p>

<p>THE ZSH/CURSES MODULE The zsh/curses module makes
available one builtin command and various parameters.</p>

<p>Builtin zcurses init zcurses end zcurses addwin
targetwin nlines ncols begin_y begin_x [ parentwin ] zcurses
delwin targetwin zcurses refresh [ targetwin ... ] zcurses
touch targetwin ... zcurses move targetwin new_y new_x
zcurses clear targetwin [ redraw | eol | bot ] zcurses
position targetwin array zcurses char targetwin character
zcurses string targetwin string zcurses border targetwin
border zcurses attr targetwin [ {+/-}attribute |
fg_col/bg_col ] [...] zcurses bg targetwin [ {+/-}attribute
| fg_col/bg_col | @char ] [...] zcurses scroll targetwin [
on | off | {+/-}lines ] zcurses input targetwin [ param [
kparam [ mparam ] ] ] zcurses mouse [ delay num |
{+/-}motion ] zcurses timeout targetwin intval zcurses
querychar targetwin [ param ] Manipulate curses windows. All
uses of this command should be bracketed by zcurses init to
initialise use of curses, and zcurses end to end it;
omitting zcurses end can cause the terminal to be in an
unwanted state.</p>

<p>The subcommand addwin creates a window with nlines lines
and ncols columns. Its upper left corner will be placed at
row begin_y and column begin_x of the screen. targetwin is a
string and refers to the name of a window that is not
currently assigned. Note in particular the curses convention
that verti- cal values appear before horizontal values.</p>

<p>If addwin is given an existing window as the final
argument, the new window is created as a subwindow of
parentwin. This differs from an ordinary new window in that
the memory of the window contents is shared with the parent
s memory. Subwindows must be deleted before their parent.
Note that the coordinates of sub- windows are relative to
the screen, not the parent, as with other windows.</p>

<p>Use the subcommand delwin to delete a window created
with addwin. Note that end does not implicitly delete
windows, and that delwin does not erase the screen image of
the window.</p>

<p>The window corresponding to the full visible screen is
called stdscr; it always exists after zcurses init and
cannot be delete with delwin.</p>

<p>The subcommand refresh will refresh window targetwin;
this is necessary to make any pending changes (such as
characters you have prepared for output with char) visible
on the screen. refresh without an argument causes the screen
to be cleared and redrawn. If multiple windows are given,
the screen is updated once at the end.</p>

<p>The subcommand touch marks the targetwins listed as
changed. This is necessary before refreshing windows if a
window that was in front of another window (which may be
stdscr) is deleted.</p>

<p>The subcommand move moves the cursor position in
targetwin to new coordinates new_y and new_x. Note that the
subcommand string (but not the subcommand char) advances the
cursor posi- tion over the characters added.</p>

<p>The subcommand clear erases the contents of targetwin.
One (and no more than one) of three options may be
specified. With the option redraw, in addition the next
refresh of targetwin will cause the screen to be cleared and
repainted. With the option eol, targetwin is only cleared to
the end of the current cursor line. With the option bot,
targetwin is cleared to the end of the window, i.e
everything to the right and below the cursor is cleared.</p>

<p>The subcommand position writes various positions
associated with targetwin into the array named array. These
are, in order:</p>

<p>The y and x coordinates of the cursor relative to the
top left of targetwin</p>

<p>The y and x coordinates of the top left of targetwin on
the screen</p>

<p>The size of targetwin in y and x dimensions.</p>

<p>Outputting characters and strings are achieved by char
and string respectively.</p>

<p>To draw a border around window targetwin, use border.
Note that the border is not subsequently handled specially:
in other words, the border is simply a set of characters
output at the edge of the window. Hence it can be
overwritten, can scroll off the window, etc.</p>

<p>The subcommand attr will set targetwin s attributes or
fore- ground/background color pair for any successive
character out- put. Each attribute given on the line may be
prepended by a + to set or a - to unset that attribute; + is
assumed if absent. The attributes supported are blink, bold,
dim, reverse, stand- out, and underline.</p>

<p>Each fg_col/bg_col attribute (to be read as fg_col on
bg_col) sets the foreground and background color for
character output. The color default is sometimes available
(in particular if the library is ncurses), specifying the
foreground or background color with which the terminal
started. The color pair default/default is always
available.</p>

<p>bg overrides the color and other attributes of all
characters in the window. Its usual use is to set the
background initially, but it will overwrite the attributes
of any characters at the time when it is called. In addition
to the arguments allowed with attr, an argument @char
specifies a character to be shown in otherwise blank areas
of the window. Owing to limitations of curses this cannot be
a multibyte character (use of ASCII char- acters only is
recommended). As the specified set of attributes override
the existing background, turning attributes off in the
arguments is not useful, though this does not cause an
error.</p>

<p>The subcommand scroll can be used with on or off to
enabled or disable scrolling of a window when the cursor
would otherwise move below the window due to typing or
output. It can also be used with a positive or negative
integer to scroll the window up or down the given number of
lines without changing the current cursor position (which
therefore appears to move in the opposite direction relative
to the window). In the second case, if scrolling is off it
is temporarily turned on to allow the window to be
scrolled.</p>

<p>The subcommand input reads a single character from the
window without echoing it back. If param is supplied the
character is assigned to the parameter param, else it is
assigned to the parameter REPLY.</p>

<p>If both param and kparam are supplied, the key is read
in key- pad mode. In this mode special keys such as function
keys and arrow keys return the name of the key in the
parameter kparam. The key names are the macros defined in
the curses.h or ncurses.h with the prefix KEY_ removed; see
also the descrip- tion of the parameter zcurses_keycodes
below. Other keys cause a value to be set in param as
before. On a successful return only one of param or kparam
contains a non-empty string; the other is set to an empty
string.</p>

<p>If mparam is also supplied, input attempts to handle
mouse input. This is only available with the ncurses
library; mouse handling can be detected by checking for the
exit status of zcurses mouse with no arguments. If a mouse
button is clicked (or double- or triple-clicked, or pressed
or released with a configurable delay from being clicked)
then kparam is set to the string MOUSE, and mparam is set to
an array consisting of the following elements: - An
identifier to discriminate different input devices; this is
only rarely useful. - The x, y and z coordinates of the
mouse click relative to the full screen, as three elements
in that order (i.e. the y coordinate is, unusually, after
the x coordinate). The z coordinate is only available for a
few unusual input devices and is otherwise set to zero. -
Any events that occurred as separate items; usually there
will be just one. An event consists of PRESSED, RELEASED,
CLICKED, DOUBLE_CLICKED or TRIPLE_CLICKED fol- lowed
immediately (in the same element) by the number of the
button. - If the shift key was pressed, the string SHIFT. -
If the control key was pressed, the string CTRL. - If the
alt key was pressed, the string ALT.</p>

<p>Not all mouse events may be passed through to the
terminal win- dow; most terminal emulators handle some mouse
events them- selves. Note that the ncurses manual implies
that using input both with and without mouse handling may
cause the mouse cursor to appear and disappear.</p>

<p>The subcommand mouse can be used to configure the use of
the mouse. There is no window argument; mouse options are
global. zcurses mouse with no arguments returns status 0 if
mouse han- dling is possible, else status 1. Otherwise, the
possible argu- ments (which may be combined on the same
command line) are as follows. delay num sets the maximum
delay in milliseconds between press and release events to be
considered as a click; the value 0 disables click
resolution, and the default is one sixth of a second. motion
proceeded by an optional + (the default) or - turns on or
off reporting of mouse motion in addi- tion to clicks,
presses and releases, which are always reported. However, it
appears reports for mouse motion are not currently
implemented.</p>

<p>The subcommand timeout specifies a timeout value for
input from targetwin. If intval is negative, zcurses input
waits indefi- nitely for a character to be typed; this is
the default. If intval is zero, zcurses input returns
immediately; if there is typeahead it is returned, else no
input is done and status 1 is returned. If intval is
positive, zcurses input waits intval milliseconds for input
and if there is none at the end of that period returns
status 1.</p>

<p>The subcommand querychar queries the character at the
current cursor position. The return values are stored in the
array named param if supplied, else in the array reply. The
first value is the character (which may be a multibyte
character if the system supports them); the second is the
color pair in the usual fg_col/bg_col notation, or 0 if
color is not supported. Any attributes other than color that
apply to the character, as set with the subcommand attr,
appear as additional elements.</p>

<p>Parameters ZCURSES_COLORS Readonly integer. The maximum
number of colors the terminal supports. This value is
initialised by the curses library and is not available until
the first time zcurses init is run.</p>

<p>ZCURSES_COLOR_PAIRS Readonly integer. The maximum number
of color pairs fg_col/bg_col that may be defined in zcurses
attr commands; note this limit applies to all color pairs
that have been used whether or not they are currently
active. This value is ini- tialised by the curses library
and is not available until the first time zcurses init is
run.</p>

<p>zcurses_attrs Readonly array. The attributes supported
by zsh/curses; avail- able as soon as the module is
loaded.</p>

<p>zcurses_colors Readonly array. The colors supported by
zsh/curses; available as soon as the module is loaded.</p>

<p>zcurses_keycodes Readonly array. The values that may be
returned in the second parameter supplied to zcurses input
in the order in which they are defined internally by curses.
Not all function keys are listed, only F0; curses reserves
space for F0 up to F63.</p>

<p>zcurses_windows Readonly array. The current list of
windows, i.e. all windows that have been created with
zcurses addwin and not removed with zcurses delwin.</p>

<p>THE ZSH/DATETIME MODULE The zsh/datetime module makes
available one builtin command:</p>

<p>strftime [ -s scalar ] format epochtime strftime -r [ -q
] [ -s scalar ] format timestring Output the date denoted by
epochtime in the format specified.</p>

<p>With the option -r (reverse), use the format format to
parse the input string timestring and output the number of
seconds since the epoch at which the time occurred. If no
timezone is parsed, the current timezone is used; other
parameters are set to zero if not present. If timestring
does not match format the command returns status 1; it will
additionally print an error message unless the option -q
(quiet) is given. If timestring matches format but not all
characters in timestring were used, the con- version
succeeds; however, a warning is issued unless the option -q
is given. The matching is implemented by the system function
strptime; see strptime(3). This means that zsh format exten-
sions are not available, however for reverse lookup they are
not required. If the function is not implemented, the
command returns status 2 and (unless -q is given) prints a
message.</p>

<p>If -s scalar is given, assign the date string (or epoch
time in seconds if -r is given) to scalar instead of
printing it.</p>

<p>The zsh/datetime module makes available one
parameter:</p>

<p>EPOCHSECONDS An integer value representing the number of
seconds since the epoch.</p>

<p>THE ZSH/DELTOCHAR MODULE The zsh/deltochar module makes
available two ZLE functions:</p>

<p>delete-to-char Read a character from the keyboard, and
delete from the cursor position up to and including the next
(or, with repeat count n, the nth) instance of that
character. Negative repeat counts mean delete backwards.</p>

<p>zap-to-char This behaves like delete-to-char, except
that the final occur- rence of the character itself is not
deleted.</p>

<p>THE ZSH/EXAMPLE MODULE The zsh/example module makes
available one builtin command:</p>

<p>example [ -flags ] [ args ... ] Displays the flags and
arguments it is invoked with.</p>

<p>The purpose of the module is to serve as an example of
how to write a module.</p>

<p>THE ZSH/FILES MODULE The zsh/files module makes
available some common commands for file manipulation as
builtins; these commands are probably not needed for many
normal situations but can be useful in emergency recovery
situa- tions with constrained resources. The commands do not
implement all features now required by relevant standards
committees.</p>

<p>For all commands, a variant beginning zf_ is also
available and loaded automatically. Using the features
capability of zmodload will let you load only those names
you want.</p>

<p>The commands loaded by default are:</p>

<p>chgrp [ -hRs ] group filename ... Changes group of files
specified. This is equivalent to chown with a user-spec
argument of :group.</p>

<p>chown [ -hRs ] user-spec filename ... Changes ownership
and group of files specified.</p>

<p>The user-spec can be in four forms:</p>

<p>user change owner to user; do not change group user::
change owner to user; do not change group user: change owner
to user; change group to users primary group user:group
change owner to user; change group to group :group do not
change owner; change group to group</p>

<p>In each case, the : may instead be a .. The rule is that
if there is a : then the separator is :, otherwise if there
is a . then the separator is ., otherwise there is no
separa- tor.</p>

<p>Each of user and group may be either a username (or
group name, as appropriate) or a decimal user ID (group ID).
Interpretation as a name takes precedence, if there is an
all-numeric username (or group name).</p>

<p>If the target is a symbolic link, the -h option causes
chown to set the ownership of the link instead of its
target.</p>

<p>The -R option causes chown to recursively descend into
directo- ries, changing the ownership of all files in the
directory after changing the ownership of the directory
itself.</p>

<p>The -s option is a zsh extension to chown functionality.
It enables paranoid behaviour, intended to avoid security
problems involving a chown being tricked into affecting
files other than the ones intended. It will refuse to follow
symbolic links, so that (for example) chown luser
/tmp/foo/passwd cant acci- dentally chown /etc/passwd if
/tmp/foo happens to be a link to /etc. It will also check
where it is after leaving directories, so that a recursive
chown of a deep directory tree cant end up recursively
chowning /usr as a result of directories being moved up the
tree.</p>

<p>ln [ -dfhins ] filename dest ln [ -dfhins ] filename ...
dir Creates hard (or, with -s, symbolic) links. In the first
form, the specified destination is created, as a link to the
specified filename. In the second form, each of the
filenames is taken in turn, and linked to a pathname in the
specified directory that has the same last pathname
component.</p>

<p>Normally, ln will not attempt to create hard links to
directo- ries. This check can be overridden using the -d
option. Typi- cally only the super-user can actually succeed
in creating hard links to directories. This does not apply
to symbolic links in any case.</p>

<p>By default, existing files cannot be replaced by links.
The -i option causes the user to be queried about replacing
existing files. The -f option causes existing files to be
silently deleted, without querying. -f takes precedence.</p>

<p>The -h and -n options are identical and both exist for
compati- bility; either one indicates that if the target is
a symlink then it should not be dereferenced. Typically this
is used in combination with -sf so that if an existing link
points to a directory then it will be removed, instead of
followed. If this option is used with multiple filenames and
the target is a sym- bolic link pointing to a directory then
the result is an error.</p>

<p>mkdir [ -p ] [ -m mode ] dir ... Creates directories.
With the -p option, non-existing parent directories are
first created if necessary, and there will be no complaint
if the directory already exists. The -m option can be used
to specify (in octal) a set of file permissions for the
created directories, otherwise mode 777 modified by the
current umask (see umask(2)) is used.</p>

<p>mv [ -fi ] filename dest mv [ -fi ] filename ... dir
Moves files. In the first form, the specified filename is
moved to the specified destination. In the second form, each
of the filenames is taken in turn, and moved to a pathname
in the spec- ified directory that has the same last pathname
component.</p>

<p>By default, the user will be queried before replacing
any file that the user cannot write to, but writable files
will be silently removed. The -i option causes the user to
be queried about replacing any existing files. The -f option
causes any existing files to be silently deleted, without
querying. -f takes precedence.</p>

<p>Note that this mv will not move files across devices.
Histori- cal versions of mv, when actual renaming is
impossible, fall back on copying and removing files; if this
behaviour is desired, use cp and rm manually. This may
change in a future version.</p>

<p>rm [ -dfirs ] filename ... Removes files and directories
specified.</p>

<p>Normally, rm will not remove directories (except with
the -r option). The -d option causes rm to try removing
directories with unlink (see unlink(2)), the same method
used for files. Typically only the super-user can actually
succeed in unlinking directories in this way. -d takes
precedence over -r.</p>

<p>By default, the user will be queried before removing any
file that the user cannot write to, but writable files will
be silently removed. The -i option causes the user to be
queried about removing any files. The -f option causes files
to be silently deleted, without querying, and suppresses all
error indications. -f takes precedence.</p>

<p>The -r option causes rm to recursively descend into
directories, deleting all files in the directory before
removing the direc- tory with the rmdir system call (see
rmdir(2)).</p>

<p>The -s option is a zsh extension to rm functionality. It
enables paranoid behaviour, intended to avoid common
security problems involving a root-run rm being tricked into
removing files other than the ones intended. It will refuse
to follow symbolic links, so that (for example) rm
/tmp/foo/passwd can t accidentally remove /etc/passwd if
/tmp/foo happens to be a link to /etc. It will also check
where it is after leaving directories, so that a recursive
removal of a deep directory tree cant end up recursively
removing /usr as a result of directories being moved up the
tree.</p>

<p>rmdir dir ... Removes empty directories specified.</p>

<p>sync Calls the system call of the same name (see
sync(2)), which flushes dirty buffers to disk. It might
return before the I/O has actually been completed.</p>

<p>THE ZSH/MAPFILE MODULE The zsh/mapfile module provides
one special associative array parameter of the same
name.</p>

<p>mapfile This associative array takes as keys the names
of files; the resulting value is the content of the file.
The value is treated identically to any other text coming
from a parameter. The value may also be assigned to, in
which case the file in question is written (whether or not
it originally existed); or an element may be unset, which
will delete the file in question. For example, vared
mapfile[myfile] works as expected, editing the file
myfile.</p>

<p>When the array is accessed as a whole, the keys are the
names of files in the current directory, and the values are
empty (to save a huge overhead in memory). Thus
${(k)mapfile} has the same affect as the glob operator *(D),
since files beginning with a dot are not special. Care must
be taken with expressions such as rm ${(k)mapfile}, which
will delete every file in the current directory without the
usual rm * test.</p>

<p>The parameter mapfile may be made read-only; in that
case, files referenced may not be written or deleted.</p>

<p>A file may conveniently be read into an array as one
line per element with the form
array=(&quot;${(f)mapfile[filename]}&quot;). The double
quotes are necessary to prevent empty lines from being
removed.</p>

<p>Limitations Although reading and writing of the file in
question is efficiently handled, zsh s internal memory
management may be arbitrarily baroque; however, mapfile is
usually very much more efficient than anything involving a
loop. Note in particular that the whole contents of the file
will always reside physically in memory when accessed
(possibly multiple times, due to standard parameter
substitution operations). In particular, this means handling
of sufficiently long files (greater than the machines swap
space, or than the range of the pointer type) will be
incorrect.</p>

<p>No errors are printed or flagged for non-existent,
unreadable, or unwritable files, as the parameter mechanism
is too low in the shell execution hierarchy to make this
convenient.</p>

<p>It is unfortunate that the mechanism for loading modules
does not yet allow the user to specify the name of the shell
parameter to be given the special behaviour.</p>

<p>THE ZSH/MATHFUNC MODULE The zsh/mathfunc module provides
standard mathematical functions for use when evaluating
mathematical formulae. The syntax agrees with nor- mal C and
FORTRAN conventions, for example,</p>

<p>(( f = sin(0.3) ))</p>

<p>assigns the sine of 0.3 to the parameter f.</p>

<p>Most functions take floating point arguments and return
a floating point value. However, any necessary conversions
from or to integer type will be performed automatically by
the shell. Apart from atan with a second argument and the
abs, int and float functions, all func- tions behave as
noted in the manual page for the corresponding C func- tion,
except that any arguments out of range for the function in
ques- tion will be detected by the shell and an error
reported.</p>

<p>The following functions take a single floating point
argument: acos, acosh, asin, asinh, atan, atanh, cbrt, ceil,
cos, cosh, erf, erfc, exp, expm1, fabs, floor, gamma, j0,
j1, lgamma, log, log10, log1p, logb, sin, sinh, sqrt, tan,
tanh, y0, y1. The atan function can optionally take a second
argument, in which case it behaves like the C function
atan2. The ilogb function takes a single floating point
argument, but returns an integer.</p>

<p>The function signgam takes no arguments, and returns an
integer, which is the C variable of the same name, as
described in gamma(3). Note that it is therefore only useful
immediately after a call to gamma or lgamma. Note also that
signgam(RPAR and signgam are distinct expressions.</p>

<p>The following functions take two floating point
arguments: copysign, fmod, hypot, nextafter.</p>

<p>The following take an integer first argument and a
floating point sec- ond argument: jn, yn.</p>

<p>The following take a floating point first argument and
an integer sec- ond argument: ldexp, scalb.</p>

<p>The function abs does not convert the type of its single
argument; it returns the absolute value of either a floating
point number or an integer. The functions float and int
convert their arguments into a floating point or integer
value (by truncation) respectively.</p>

<p>Note that the C pow function is available in ordinary
math evaluation as the ** operator and is not provided
here.</p>

<p>The function rand48 is available if your system s
mathematical library has the function erand48(3). It returns
a pseudo-random floating point number between 0 and 1. It
takes a single string optional argument.</p>

<p>If the argument is not present, the random number seed
is initialised by three calls to the rand(3) function ---
this produces the same ran- dom numbers as the next three
values of $RANDOM.</p>

<p>If the argument is present, it gives the name of a
scalar parameter where the current random number seed will
be stored. On the first call, the value must contain at
least twelve hexadecimal digits (the remainder of the string
is ignored), or the seed will be initialised in the same
manner as for a call to rand48 with no argument. Subsequent
calls to rand48(param) will then maintain the seed in the
parameter param as a string of twelve hexadecimal digits,
with no base signifier. The random number sequences for
different parameters are completely independent, and are
also independent from that used by calls to rand48 with no
argument.</p>

<p>For example, consider</p>

<p>print $(( rand48(seed) )) print $(( rand48() )) print
$(( rand48(seed) ))</p>

<p>Assuming $seed does not exist, it will be initialised by
the first call. In the second call, the default seed is
initialised; note, how- ever, that because of the properties
of rand() there is a correlation between the seeds used for
the two initialisations, so for more secure uses, you should
generate your own 12-byte seed. The third call returns to
the same sequence of random numbers used in the first call,
unaffected by the intervening rand48().</p>

<p>THE ZSH/NEWUSER MODULE The zsh/newuser module is loaded
at boot if it is available, the RCS option is set, and the
PRIVILEGED option is not set (all three are true by
default). This takes place immediately after commands in the
global zshenv file (typically /etc/zshenv), if any, have
been executed. If the module is not available it is silently
ignored by the shell; the module may safely be removed from
$MODULE_PATH by the administrator if it is not required.</p>

<p>On loading, the module tests if any of the start-up
files .zshenv, .zprofile, .zshrc or .zlogin exist in the
directory given by the envi- ronment variable ZDOTDIR, or
the users home directory if that is not set. The test is not
performed and the module halts processing if the shell was
in an emulation mode (i.e. had been invoked as some other
shell than zsh).</p>

<p>If none of the start-up files were found, the module
then looks for the file newuser first in a sitewide
directory, usually the parent direc- tory of the
site-functions directory, and if that is not found the mod-
ule searches in a version-specific directory, usually the
parent of the functions directory containing
version-specific functions. (These directories can be
configured when zsh is built using the
--enable-site-scriptdir=dir and --enable-scriptdir=dir flags
to config- ure, respectively; the defaults are
prefix/share/zsh and pre- fix/share/zsh/$ZSH_VERSION where
the default prefix is /usr/local.)</p>

<p>If the file newuser is found, it is then sourced in the
same manner as a start-up file. The file is expected to
contain code to install start-up files for the user, however
any valid shell code will be exe- cuted.</p>

<p>The zsh/newuser module is then unconditionally
unloaded.</p>

<p>Note that it is possible to achieve exactly the same
effect as the zsh/newuser module by adding code to
/etc/zshenv. The module exists simply to allow the shell to
make arrangements for new users without the need for
intervention by package maintainers and system administra-
tors.</p>

<p>The script supplied with the module invokes the shell
function zsh-newuser-install. This may be invoked directly
by the user even if the zsh/newuser module is disabled.
Note, however, that if the module is not installed the
function will not be installed either. The func- tion is
documented in the section User Configuration Functions in
zsh- contrib(1).</p>

<p>THE ZSH/PARAMETER MODULE The zsh/parameter module gives
access to some of the internal hash tables used by the shell
by defining some special parameters.</p>

<p>options The keys for this associative array are the
names of the options that can be set and unset using the
setopt and unsetopt builtins. The value of each key is
either the string on if the option is currently set, or the
string off if the option is unset. Setting a key to one of
these strings is like setting or unsetting the option,
respectively. Unsetting a key in this array is like setting
it to the value off.</p>

<p>commands This array gives access to the command hash
table. The keys are the names of external commands, the
values are the pathnames of the files that would be executed
when the command would be invoked. Setting a key in this
array defines a new entry in this table in the same way as
with the hash builtin. Unsetting a key as in unset
&quot;commands[foo]&quot; removes the entry for the given
key from the command hash table.</p>

<p>functions This associative array maps names of enabled
functions to their definitions. Setting a key in it is like
defining a function with the name given by the key and the
body given by the value. Unsetting a key removes the
definition for the function named by the key.</p>

<p>dis_functions Like functions but for disabled
functions.</p>

<p>builtins This associative array gives information about
the builtin com- mands currently enabled. The keys are the
names of the builtin commands and the values are either
undefined for builtin com- mands that will automatically be
loaded from a module if invoked or defined for builtin
commands that are already loaded.</p>

<p>dis_builtins Like builtins but for disabled builtin
commands.</p>

<p>reswords This array contains the enabled reserved
words.</p>

<p>dis_reswords Like reswords but for disabled reserved
words.</p>

<p>aliases This maps the names of the regular aliases
currently enabled to their expansions.</p>

<p>dis_aliases Like aliases but for disabled regular
aliases.</p>

<p>galiases Like aliases, but for global aliases.</p>

<p>dis_galiases Like galiases but for disabled global
aliases.</p>

<p>saliases Like raliases, but for suffix aliases.</p>

<p>dis_saliases Like saliases but for disabled suffix
aliases.</p>

<p>parameters The keys in this associative array are the
names of the parame- ters currently defined. The values are
strings describing the type of the parameter, in the same
format used by the t parame- ter flag, see zshexpn(1) .
Setting or unsetting keys in this array is not possible.</p>

<p>modules An associative array giving information about
modules. The keys are the names of the modules loaded,
registered to be autoloaded, or aliased. The value says
which state the named module is in and is one of the strings
loaded, autoloaded, or alias:name, where name is the name
the module is aliased to.</p>

<p>Setting or unsetting keys in this array is not
possible.</p>

<p>dirstack A normal array holding the elements of the
directory stack. Note that the output of the dirs builtin
command includes one more directory, the current working
directory.</p>

<p>history This associative array maps history event
numbers to the full history lines.</p>

<p>historywords A special array containing the words stored
in the history.</p>

<p>jobdirs This associative array maps job numbers to the
directories from which the job was started (which may not be
the current direc- tory of the job).</p>

<p>The keys of the associative arrays are usually valid job
num- bers, and these are the values output with, for
example, ${(k)jobdirs}. Non-numeric job references may be
used when looking up a value; for example, ${jobdirs[%+]}
refers to the current job.</p>

<p>jobtexts This associative array maps job numbers to the
texts of the com- mand lines that were used to start the
jobs.</p>

<p>Handling of the keys of the associative array is as
described for jobdirs above.</p>

<p>jobstates This associative array gives information about
the states of the jobs currently known. The keys are the job
numbers and the val- ues are strings of the form
job-state:mark:pid=state.... The job-state gives the state
the whole job is currently in, one of running, suspended, or
done. The mark is + for the cur- rent job, - for the
previous job and empty otherwise. This is followed by one
pid=state for every process in the job. The pids are, of
course, the process IDs and the state describes the state of
that process.</p>

<p>Handling of the keys of the associative array is as
described for jobdirs above.</p>

<p>nameddirs This associative array maps the names of named
directories to the pathnames they stand for.</p>

<p>userdirs This associative array maps user names to the
pathnames of their home directories.</p>

<p>funcfiletrace This array contains the absolute line
numbers and corresponding file names for the point where the
current function, sourced file, or (if EVAL_LINENO is set)
eval command was called. The array is of the same length as
funcsourcetrace and functrace, but differs from
funcsourcetrace in that the line and file are the point of
call, not the point of definition, and differs from
functrace in that all values are absolute line numbers in
files, rather than relative to the start of a function, if
any.</p>

<p>funcsourcetrace This array contains the file names and
line numbers of the points where the functions, sourced
files, and (if EVAL_LINENO is set) eval commands currently
being executed were defined. The line number is the line
where the function name or name () started. In the case of
an autoloaded function the line number is reported as zero.
The format of each element is file- name:lineno. For
functions autoloaded from a file in native zsh format, where
only the body of the function occurs in the file, or for
files that have been executed by the source or . builtins,
the trace information is shown as filename:0, since the
entire file is the definition.</p>

<p>Most users will be interested in the information in the
func- filetrace array instead.</p>

<p>funcstack This array contains the names of the
functions, sourced files, and (if EVAL_LINENO is set) eval
commands. currently being exe- cuted. The first element is
the name of the function using the parameter.</p>

<p>functrace This array contains the names and line numbers
of the callers corresponding to the functions currently
being executed. The format of each element is name:lineno.
Callers are also shown for sourced files; the caller is the
point where the source or . command was executed.</p>

<p>THE ZSH/PCRE MODULE The zsh/pcre module makes some
commands available as builtins:</p>

<p>pcre_compile [ -aimxs ] PCRE Compiles a perl-compatible
regular expression.</p>

<p>Option -a will force the pattern to be anchored. Option
-i will compile a case-insensitive pattern. Option -m will
compile a multi-line pattern; that is, ^ and $ will match
newlines within the pattern. Option -x will compile an
extended pattern, wherein whitespace and # comments are
ignored. Option -s makes the dot metacharacter match all
characters, including those that indicate newline.</p>

<p>pcre_study Studies the previously-compiled PCRE which
may result in faster matching.</p>

<p>pcre_match [ -v var ] [ -a arr ] [ -n offset ] [ -b ]
string Returns successfully if string matches the
previously-compiled PCRE.</p>

<p>Upon successful match, if the expression captures
substrings within parentheses, pcre_match will set the array
$match to those substrings, unless the -a option is given,
in which case it will set the array arr. Similarly, the
variable MATCH will be set to the entire matched portion of
the string, unless the -v option is given, in which case the
variable var will be set. No variables are altered if there
is no successful match. A -n option starts searching for a
match from the byte offset posi- tion in string. If the -b
option is given, the variable ZPCRE_OP will be set to an
offset pair string, representing the byte offset positions
of the entire matched portion within the string. For
example, a ZPCRE_OP set to &quot;32 45&quot; indicates that
the matched portion began on byte offset 32 and ended on
byte offset 44. Here, byte offset position 45 is the
position directly after the matched portion. Keep in mind
that the byte position isn t necessarily the same as the
character position when UTF-8 characters are involved.
Consequently, the byte off- set positions are only to be
relied on in the context of using them for subsequent
searches on string, using an offset position as an argument
to the -n option. This is mostly used to imple- ment the
&quot;find all non-overlapping matches&quot;
functionality.</p>

<p>A simple example of &quot;find all non-overlapping
matches&quot;:</p>

<p>string=&quot;The following zip codes: 78884 90210
99513&quot; pcre_compile -m d{5}&quot; accum=() pcre_match
-b -- $string while [[ $? -eq 0 ]] do b=($=ZPCRE_OP)
accum+=$MATCH pcre_match -b -n $b[2] -- $string done print
-l $accum</p>

<p>The zsh/pcre module makes available the following test
condition: expr -pcre-match pcre Matches a string against a
perl-compatible regular expression.</p>

<p>For example,</p>

<p>[[ &quot;$text&quot; -pcre-match ^d+$ ]] &amp;&amp;
print text variable contains only &quot;ds&quot;.</p>

<p>THE ZSH/REGEX MODULE The zsh/regex module makes
available the following test condition: expr -regex-match
regex Matches a string against a POSIX extended regular
expression. On successful match, matched portion of the
string will normally be placed in the MATCH variable. If
there are any capturing parentheses within the regex, then
the match array variable will contain those. If the match is
not successful, then the vari- ables will not be
altered.</p>

<p>For example,</p>

<p>[[ alphabetical -regex-match ^a([^a]+)a([^a]+)a ]]
&amp;&amp; print -l $MATCH X $match</p>

<p>If the option REMATCH_PCRE is not set, then the =~
operator will automatically load this module as needed and
will invoke the -regex-match operator.</p>

<p>If BASH_REMATCH is set, then the array BASH_REMATCH will
be set instead of MATCH and match.</p>

<p>THE ZSH/SCHED MODULE The zsh/sched module makes
available one builtin command and one param- eter.</p>

<p>sched [-o] [+]hh:mm[:ss] command ... sched [-o]
[+]seconds command ... sched [ -item ] Make an entry in the
scheduled list of commands to execute. The time may be
specified in either absolute or relative time, and either as
hours, minutes and (optionally) seconds separated by a
colon, or seconds alone. An absolute number of seconds indi-
cates the time since the epoch (1970/01/01 00:00); this is
use- ful in combination with the features in the
zsh/datetime module, see the zsh/datetime module entry in
zshmodules(1).</p>

<p>With no arguments, prints the list of scheduled
commands. If the scheduled command has the -o flag set, this
is shown at the start of the command.</p>

<p>With the argument -item, removes the given item from the
list. The numbering of the list is continuous and entries
are in time order, so the numbering can change when entries
are added or deleted.</p>

<p>Commands are executed either immediately before a
prompt, or while the shells line editor is waiting for
input. In the lat- ter case it is useful to be able to
produce output that does not interfere with the line being
edited. Providing the option -o causes the shell to clear
the command line before the event and redraw it afterwards.
This should be used with any scheduled event that produces
visible output to the terminal; it is not needed, for
example, with output that updates a terminal emula- tors
title bar.</p>

<p>zsh_scheduled_events A readonly array corresponding to
the events scheduled by the sched builtin. The indices of
the array correspond to the num- bers shown when sched is
run with no arguments (provided that the KSH_ARRAYS option
is not set). The value of the array con- sists of the
scheduled time in seconds since the epoch (see the section
The zsh/datetime Module for facilities for using this
number), followed by a colon, followed by any options (which
may be empty but will be preceded by a - otherwise),
followed by a colon, followed by the command to be
executed.</p>

<p>The sched builtin should be used for manipulating the
events. Note that this will have an immediate effect on the
contents of the array, so that indices may become
invalid.</p>

<p>THE ZSH/NET/SOCKET MODULE The zsh/net/socket module
makes available one builtin command:</p>

<p>zsocket [ -altv ] [ -d fd ] [ args ] zsocket is
implemented as a builtin to allow full use of shell command
line editing, file I/O, and job control mechanisms.</p>

<p>Outbound Connections zsocket [ -v ] [ -d fd ] filename
Open a new Unix domain connection to filename. The shell
param- eter REPLY will be set to the file descriptor
associated with that connection. Currently, only stream
connections are sup- ported.</p>

<p>If -d is specified, its argument will be taken as the
target file descriptor for the connection.</p>

<p>In order to elicit more verbose output, use -v.</p>

<p>Inbound Connections zsocket -l [ -v ] [ -d fd ] filename
zsocket -l will open a socket listening on filename. The
shell parameter REPLY will be set to the file descriptor
associated with that listener.</p>

<p>If -d is specified, its argument will be taken as the
target file descriptor for the connection.</p>

<p>In order to elicit more verbose output, use -v.</p>

<p>zsocket -a [ -tv ] [ -d targetfd ] listenfd zsocket -a
will accept an incoming connection to the socket associated
with listenfd. The shell parameter REPLY will be set to the
file descriptor associated with the inbound connection.</p>

<p>If -d is specified, its argument will be taken as the
target file descriptor for the connection.</p>

<p>If -t is specified, zsocket will return if no incoming
connec- tion is pending. Otherwise it will wait for one.</p>

<p>In order to elicit more verbose output, use -v.</p>

<p>THE ZSH/STAT MODULE The zsh/stat module makes available
one builtin command under two pos- sible names:</p>

<p>zstat [ -gnNolLtTrs ] [ -f fd ] [ -H hash ] [ -A array ]
[ -F fmt ] [ +element ] [ file ... ] stat ... The command
acts as a front end to the stat system call (see stat(2)).
The same command is provided with two names; as the name
stat is often used by an external command it is recommended
that only the zstat form of the command is used. This can be
arranged by loading the module with the command zmodload -F
zsh/stat b:zstat.</p>

<p>If the stat call fails, the appropriate system error
message printed and status 1 is returned. The fields of
struct stat give information about the files provided as
arguments to the command. In addition to those available
from the stat call, an extra element link is provided. These
elements are:</p>

<p>device The number of the device on which the file
resides.</p>

<p>inode The unique number of the file on this device
(inode number).</p>

<p>mode The mode of the file; that is, the files type and
access permissions. With the -s option, this will be
returned as a string corresponding to the first column in
the dis- play of the ls -l command.</p>

<p>nlink The number of hard links to the file.</p>

<p>uid The user ID of the owner of the file. With the -s
option, this is displayed as a user name.</p>

<p>gid The group ID of the file. With the -s option, this
is displayed as a group name.</p>

<p>rdev The raw device number. This is only useful for
special devices.</p>

<p>size The size of the file in bytes.</p>

<p>atime mtime ctime The last access, modification and
inode change times of the file, respectively, as the number
of seconds since midnight GMT on 1st January, 1970. With the
-s option, these are printed as strings for the local time
zone; the format can be altered with the -F option, and with
the -g option the times are in GMT.</p>

<p>blksize The number of bytes in one allocation block on
the device on which the file resides.</p>

<p>block The number of disk blocks used by the file.</p>

<p>link If the file is a link and the -L option is in
effect, this contains the name of the file linked to,
otherwise it is empty. Note that if this element is selected
( zstat +link ) then the -L option is automatically
used.</p>

<p>A particular element may be selected by including its
name pre- ceded by a + in the option list; only one element
is allowed. The element may be shortened to any unique set
of leading char- acters. Otherwise, all elements will be
shown for all files.</p>

<p>Options:</p>

<p>-A array Instead of displaying the results on standard
output, assign them to an array, one struct stat element per
array element for each file in order. In this case nei- ther
the name of the element nor the name of the files appears in
array unless the -t or -n options were given, respectively.
If -t is given, the element name appears as a prefix to the
appropriate array element; if -n is given, the file name
appears as a separate array element preceding all the
others. Other formatting options are respected.</p>

<p>-H hash Similar to -A, but instead assign the values to
hash. The keys are the elements listed above. If the -n
option is provided then the name of the file is included in
the hash with key name.</p>

<p>-f fd Use the file on file descriptor fd instead of
named files; no list of file names is allowed in this
case.</p>

<p>-F fmt Supplies a strftime (see strftime(3)) string for
the for- matting of the time elements. The -s option is
implied.</p>

<p>-g Show the time elements in the GMT time zone. The -s
option is implied.</p>

<p>-l List the names of the type elements (to standard
output or an array as appropriate) and return immediately;
options other than -A and arguments are ignored.</p>

<p>-L Perform an lstat (see lstat(2)) rather than a stat
system call. In this case, if the file is a link,
information about the link itself rather than the target
file is returned. This option is required to make the link
ele- ment useful. Its important to note that this is the
exact opposite from ls(1), etc.</p>

<p>-n Always show the names of files. Usually these are
only shown when output is to standard output and there is
more than one file in the list.</p>

<p>-N Never show the names of files.</p>

<p>-o If a raw file mode is printed, show it in octal,
which is more useful for human consumption than the default
of decimal. A leading zero will be printed in this case.
Note that this does not affect whether a raw or formatted
file mode is shown, which is controlled by the -r and -s
options, nor whether a mode is shown at all.</p>

<p>-r Print raw data (the default format) alongside string
data (the -s format); the string data appears in parentheses
after the raw data.</p>

<p>-s Print mode, uid, gid and the three time elements as
strings instead of numbers. In each case the format is like
that of ls -l.</p>

<p>-t Always show the type names for the elements of struct
stat. Usually these are only shown when output is to
standard output and no individual element has been
selected.</p>

<p>-T Never show the type names of the struct stat
elements.</p>

<p>THE ZSH/SYSTEM MODULE The zsh/system module makes
available three builtin commands and two parameters.</p>

<p>Builtins syserror [ -e errvar ] [ -p prefix ] [ errno |
errname ] This command prints out the error message
associated with errno, a system error number, followed by a
newline to standard error.</p>

<p>Instead of the error number, a name errname, for example
ENOENT, may be used. The set of names is the same as the
contents of the array errnos, see below.</p>

<p>If the string prefix is given, it is printed in front of
the error message, with no intervening space.</p>

<p>If errvar is supplied, the entire message, without a
newline, is assigned to the parameter names errvar and
nothing is output.</p>

<p>A return status of 0 indicates the message was
successfully printed (although it may not be useful if the
error number was out of the systems range), a return status
of 1 indicates an error in the parameters, and a return
status of 2 indicates the error name was not recognised (no
message is printed for this).</p>

<p>sysread [ -c countvar ] [ -i infd ] [ -o outfd ] [ -s
bufsize ] [ -t timeout ] [ param ] Perform a single system
read from file descriptor infd, or zero if that is not
given. The result of the read is stored in param or REPLY if
that is not given. If countvar is given, the number of bytes
read is assigned to the parameter named by countvar.</p>

<p>The maximum number of bytes read is bufsize or 8192 if
that is not given, however the command returns as soon as
any number of bytes was successfully read.</p>

<p>If timeout is given, it specifies a timeout in seconds,
which may be zero to poll the file descriptor. This is
handled by the poll system call if available, otherwise the
select system call if available.</p>

<p>If outfd is given, an attempt is made to write all the
bytes just read to the file descriptor outfd. If this fails,
because of a system error other than EINTR or because of an
internal zsh error during an interrupt, the bytes read but
not written are stored in the parameter named by param if
supplied (no default is used in this case), and the number
of bytes read but not written is stored in the parameter
named by countvar if that is supplied. If it was successful,
countvar contains the full num- ber of bytes transferred, as
usual, and param is not set.</p>

<p>The error EINTR (interrupted system call) is handled
internally so that shell interrupts are transparent to the
caller. Any other error causes a return.</p>

<p>The possible return statuses are 0 At least one byte of
data was successfully read and, if appropriate, written.</p>

<p>1 There was an error in the parameters to the command.
This is the only error for which a message is printed to
standard error.</p>

<p>2 There was an error on the read, or on polling the
input file descriptor for a timeout. The parameter ERRNO
gives the error.</p>

<p>3 Data were successfully read, but there was an error
writ- ing them to outfd. The parameter ERRNO gives the
error.</p>

<p>4 The attempt to read timed out. Note this does not set
ERRNO as this is not a system error.</p>

<p>5 No system error occurred, but zero bytes were read.
This usually indicates end of file. The parameters are set
according to the usual rules; no write to outfd is
attempted.</p>

<p>syswrite [ -c countvar ] [ -o outfd ] data The data (a
single string of bytes) are written to the file descriptor
outfd, or 1 if that is not given, using the write system
call. Multiple write operations may be used if the first
does not write all the data.</p>

<p>If countvar is given, the number of byte written is
stored in the parameter named by countvar; this may not be
the full length of data if an error occurred.</p>

<p>The error EINTR (interrupted system call) is handled
internally by retrying; otherwise an error causes the
command to return. For example, if the file descriptor is
set to non-blocking out- put, an error EAGAIN (on some
systems, EWOULDBLOCK) may result in the command returning
early.</p>

<p>The return status may be 0 for success, 1 for an error
in the parameters to the command, or 2 for an error on the
write; no error message is printed in the last case, but the
parameter ERRNO will reflect the error that occurred.</p>

<p>Parameters errnos A readonly array of the names of
errors defined on the system. These are typically macros
defined in C by including the system header file errno.h.
The index of each name (assuming the option KSH_ARRAYS is
unset) corresponds to the error number. Error numbers num
before the last known error which have no name are given the
name Enum in the array.</p>

<p>Note that aliases for errors are not handled; only the
canonical name is used.</p>

<p>sysparams A readonly associative array. The keys are:
pid Returns the process ID of the current process, even in
sub- shells. Compare $$, which returns the process ID of the
main shell process.</p>

<p>ppid Returns the process ID of the parent of the current
process, even in subshells. Compare $PPID, which returns the
process ID of the parent of the main shell process.</p>

<p>THE ZSH/NET/TCP MODULE The zsh/net/tcp module makes
available one builtin command:</p>

<p>ztcp [ -acflLtv ] [ -d fd ] [ args ] ztcp is implemented
as a builtin to allow full use of shell com- mand line
editing, file I/O, and job control mechanisms.</p>

<p>If ztcp is run with no options, it will output the
contents of its session table.</p>

<p>If it is run with only the option -L, it will output the
con- tents of the session table in a format suitable for
automatic parsing. The option is ignored if given with a
command to open or close a session. The output consists of a
set of lines, one per session, each containing the following
elements separated by spaces:</p>

<p>File descriptor The file descriptor in use for the
connection. For nor- mal inbound (I) and outbound (O)
connections this may be read and written by the usual shell
mechanisms. However, it should only be close with ztcp
-c.</p>

<p>Connection type A letter indicating how the session was
created:</p>

<p>Z A session created with the zftp command.</p>

<p>L A connection opened for listening with ztcp -l.</p>

<p>I An inbound connection accepted with ztcp -a.</p>

<p>O An outbound connection created with ztcp host ....</p>

<p>The local host This is usually set to an all-zero IP
address as the address of the localhost is irrelevant.</p>

<p>The local port This is likely to be zero unless the
connection is for listening.</p>

<p>The remote host This is the fully qualified domain name
of the peer, if available, else an IP address. It is an
all-zero IP address for a session opened for listening.</p>

<p>The remote port This is zero for a connection opened for
listening.</p>

<p>Outbound Connections ztcp [ -v ] [ -d fd ] host [ port ]
Open a new TCP connection to host. If the port is omitted,
it will default to port 23. The connection will be added to
the session table and the shell parameter REPLY will be set
to the file descriptor associated with that connection.</p>

<p>If -d is specified, its argument will be taken as the
target file descriptor for the connection.</p>

<p>In order to elicit more verbose output, use -v.</p>

<p>Inbound Connections ztcp -l [ -v ] [ -d fd ] port ztcp
-l will open a socket listening on TCP port. The socket will
be added to the session table and the shell parameter REPLY
will be set to the file descriptor associated with that lis-
tener.</p>

<p>If -d is specified, its argument will be taken as the
target file descriptor for the connection.</p>

<p>In order to elicit more verbose output, use -v.</p>

<p>ztcp -a [ -tv ] [ -d targetfd ] listenfd ztcp -a will
accept an incoming connection to the port associ- ated with
listenfd. The connection will be added to the session table
and the shell parameter REPLY will be set to the file
descriptor associated with the inbound connection.</p>

<p>If -d is specified, its argument will be taken as the
target file descriptor for the connection.</p>

<p>If -t is specified, ztcp will return if no incoming
connection is pending. Otherwise it will wait for one.</p>

<p>In order to elicit more verbose output, use -v.</p>

<p>Closing Connections ztcp -cf [ -v ] [ fd ] ztcp -c [ -v
] [ fd ] ztcp -c will close the socket associated with fd.
The socket will be removed from the session table. If fd is
not specified, ztcp will close everything in the session
table.</p>

<p>Normally, sockets registered by zftp (see zshmodules(1)
) cannot be closed this way. In order to force such a socket
closed, use -f.</p>

<p>In order to elicit more verbose output, use -v.</p>

<p>Example Here is how to create a TCP connection between
two instances of zsh. We need to pick an unassigned port;
here we use the randomly chosen 5123.</p>

<p>On host1, zmodload zsh/net/tcp ztcp -l 5123
listenfd=$REPLY ztcp -a $listenfd fd=$REPLY The second from
last command blocks until there is an incoming connec-
tion.</p>

<p>Now create a connection from host2 (which may, of
course, be the same machine): zmodload zsh/net/tcp ztcp
host1 5123 fd=$REPLY</p>

<p>Now on each host, $fd contains a file descriptor for
talking to the other. For example, on host1: print This is a
message &gt;&amp;$fd and on host2: read -r line
&lt;&amp;$fd; print -r - $line prints This is a message.</p>

<p>To tidy up, on host1: ztcp -c $listenfd ztcp -c $fd and
on host2 ztcp -c $fd</p>

<p>THE ZSH/TERMCAP MODULE The zsh/termcap module makes
available one builtin command:</p>

<p>echotc cap [ arg ... ] Output the termcap value
corresponding to the capability cap, with optional
arguments.</p>

<p>The zsh/termcap module makes available one
parameter:</p>

<p>termcap An associative array that maps termcap
capability codes to their values.</p>

<p>THE ZSH/TERMINFO MODULE The zsh/terminfo module makes
available one builtin command:</p>

<p>echoti cap [ arg ] Output the terminfo value
corresponding to the capability cap, instantiated with arg
if applicable.</p>

<p>The zsh/terminfo module makes available one
parameter:</p>

<p>terminfo An associative array that maps terminfo
capability names to their values.</p>

<p>THE ZSH/ZFTP MODULE The zsh/zftp module makes available
one builtin command:</p>

<p>zftp subcommand [ args ] The zsh/zftp module is a client
for FTP (file transfer proto- col). It is implemented as a
builtin to allow full use of shell command line editing,
file I/O, and job control mechanisms. Often, users will
access it via shell functions providing a more powerful
interface; a set is provided with the zsh distribution and
is described in zshzftpsys(1). However, the zftp command is
entirely usable in its own right.</p>

<p>All commands consist of the command name zftp followed
by the name of a subcommand. These are listed below. The
return sta- tus of each subcommand is supposed to reflect
the success or failure of the remote operation. See a
description of the vari- able ZFTP_VERBOSE for more
information on how responses from the server may be
printed.</p>

<p>Subcommands open host[:port] [ user [ password [ account
] ] ] Open a new FTP session to host, which may be the name
of a TCP/IP connected host or an IP number in the standard
dot nota- tion. If the argument is in the form host:port,
open a connec- tion to TCP port port instead of the standard
FTP port 21. This may be the name of a TCP service or a
number: see the descrip- tion of ZFTP_PORT below for more
information.</p>

<p>If IPv6 addresses in colon format are used, the host
should be surrounded by quoted square brackets to
distinguish it from the port, for example
[fe80::203:baff:fe02:8b56. For consistency this is allowed
with all forms of host.</p>

<p>Remaining arguments are passed to the login subcommand.
Note that if no arguments beyond host are supplied, open
will not automatically call login. If no arguments at all
are supplied, open will use the parameters set by the params
subcommand.</p>

<p>After a successful open, the shell variables ZFTP_HOST,
ZFTP_PORT, ZFTP_IP and ZFTP_SYSTEM are available; see Vari-
ables below.</p>

<p>login [ name [ password [ account ] ] ] user [ name [
password [ account ] ] ] Login the user name with parameters
password and account. Any of the parameters can be omitted,
and will be read from standard input if needed (name is
always needed). If standard input is a terminal, a prompt
for each one will be printed on standard error and password
will not be echoed. If any of the parameters are not used, a
warning message is printed.</p>

<p>After a successful login, the shell variables ZFTP_USER,
ZFTP_ACCOUNT and ZFTP_PWD are available; see Variables
below.</p>

<p>This command may be re-issued when a user is already
logged in, and the server will first be reinitialized for a
new user.</p>

<p>params [ host [ user [ password [ account ] ] ] ] params
- Store the given parameters for a later open command with
no arguments. Only those given on the command line will be
remem- bered. If no arguments are given, the parameters
currently set are printed, although the password will appear
as a line of stars; the return status is one if no
parameters were set, zero otherwise.</p>

<p>Any of the parameters may be specified as a ? , which
may need to be quoted to protect it from shell expansion. In
this case, the appropriate parameter will be read from stdin
as with the login subcommand, including special handling of
password. If the ? is followed by a string, that is used as
the prompt for reading the parameter instead of the default
message (any neces- sary punctuation and whitespace should
be included at the end of the prompt). The first letter of
the parameter (only) may be quoted with a; hence an argument
$word&quot; guarantees that the string from the shell
parameter $word will be treated liter- ally, whether or not
it begins with a ?.</p>

<p>If instead a single - is given, the existing parameters,
if any, are deleted. In that case, calling open with no
arguments will cause an error.</p>

<p>The list of parameters is not deleted after a close,
however it will be deleted if the zsh/zftp module is
unloaded.</p>

<p>For example,</p>

<p>zftp params ftp.elsewhere.xx juser ?Password for
juser:</p>

<p>will store the host ftp.elsewhere.xx and the user juser
and then prompt the user for the corresponding password with
the given prompt.</p>

<p>test Test the connection; if the server has reported
that it has closed the connection (maybe due to a timeout),
return status 2; if no connection was open anyway, return
status 1; else return status 0. The test subcommand is
silent, apart from messages printed by the $ZFTP_VERBOSE
mechanism, or error messages if the connection closes. There
is no network overhead for this test.</p>

<p>The test is only supported on systems with either the
select(2) or poll(2) system calls; otherwise the message not
supported on this system is printed instead.</p>

<p>The test subcommand will automatically be called at the
start of any other subcommand for the current session when a
connection is open.</p>

<p>cd directory Change the remote directory to directory.
Also alters the shell variable ZFTP_PWD.</p>

<p>cdup Change the remote directory to the one higher in
the directory tree. Note that cd .. will also work correctly
on non-UNIX sys- tems.</p>

<p>dir [ args... ] Give a (verbose) listing of the remote
directory. The args are passed directly to the server. The
command s behaviour is imple- mentation dependent, but a
UNIX server will typically interpret args as arguments to
the ls command and with no arguments return the result of ls
-l. The directory is listed to standard out- put.</p>

<p>ls [ args ] Give a (short) listing of the remote
directory. With no args, produces a raw list of the files in
the directory, one per line. Otherwise, up to vagaries of
the server implementation, behaves similar to dir.</p>

<p>type [ type ] Change the type for the transfer to type,
or print the current type if type is absent. The allowed
values are A (ASCII), I (Image, i.e. binary), or B (a
synonym for I).</p>

<p>The FTP default for a transfer is ASCII. However, if
zftp finds that the remote host is a UNIX machine with 8-bit
byes, it will automatically switch to using binary for file
transfers upon open. This can subsequently be
overridden.</p>

<p>The transfer type is only passed to the remote host when
a data connection is established; this command involves no
network overhead.</p>

<p>ascii The same as type A.</p>

<p>binary The same as type I.</p>

<p>mode [ S | B ] Set the mode type to stream (S) or block
(B). Stream mode is the default; block mode is not widely
supported.</p>

<p>remote files... local [ files... ] Print the size and
last modification time of the remote or local files. If
there is more than one item on the list, the name of the
file is printed first. The first number is the file size,
the second is the last modification time of the file in the
for- mat CCYYMMDDhhmmSS consisting of year, month, date,
hour, min- utes and seconds in GMT. Note that this format,
including the length, is guaranteed, so that time strings
can be directly com- pared via the [[ builtins &lt; and &gt;
operators, even if they are too long to be represented as
integers.</p>

<p>Not all servers support the commands for retrieving this
infor- mation. In that case, the remote command will print
nothing and return status 2, compared with status 1 for a
file not found.</p>

<p>The local command (but not remote) may be used with no
argu- ments, in which case the information comes from
examining file descriptor zero. This is the same file as
seen by a put command with no further redirection.</p>

<p>get file [...] Retrieve all files from the server,
concatenating them and send- ing them to standard
output.</p>

<p>put file [...] For each file, read a file from standard
input and send that to the remote host with the given
name.</p>

<p>append file [...] As put, but if the remote file already
exists, data is appended to it instead of overwriting
it.</p>

<p>getat file point putat file point appendat file point
Versions of get, put and append which will start the
transfer at the given point in the remote file. This is
useful for append- ing to an incomplete local file. However,
note that this abil- ity is not universally supported by
servers (and is not quite the behaviour specified by the
standard).</p>

<p>delete file [...] Delete the list of files on the
server.</p>

<p>mkdir directory Create a new directory directory on the
server.</p>

<p>rmdir directory Delete the directory directory on the
server.</p>

<p>rename old-name new-name Rename file old-name to
new-name on the server.</p>

<p>site args... Send a host-specific command to the server.
You will probably only need this if instructed by the server
to use it.</p>

<p>quote args... Send the raw FTP command sequence to the
server. You should be familiar with the FTP command set as
defined in RFC959 before doing this. Useful commands may
include STAT and HELP. Note also the mechanism for returning
messages as described for the variable ZFTP_VERBOSE below,
in particular that all messages from the control connection
are sent to standard error.</p>

<p>close quit Close the current data connection. This
unsets the shell param- eters ZFTP_HOST, ZFTP_PORT, ZFTP_IP,
ZFTP_SYSTEM, ZFTP_USER, ZFTP_ACCOUNT, ZFTP_PWD, ZFTP_TYPE
and ZFTP_MODE.</p>

<p>session [ sessname ] Allows multiple FTP sessions to be
used at once. The name of the session is an arbitrary string
of characters; the default session is called default . If
this command is called without an argument, it will list all
the current sessions; with an argument, it will either
switch to the existing session called sessname, or create a
new session of that name.</p>

<p>Each session remembers the status of the connection, the
set of connection-specific shell parameters (the same set as
are unset when a connection closes, as given in the
description of close), and any user parameters specified
with the params subcommand. Changing to a previous session
restores those values; changing to a new session initialises
them in the same way as if zftp had just been loaded. The
name of the current session is given by the parameter
ZFTP_SESSION.</p>

<p>rmsession [ sessname ] Delete a session; if a name is
not given, the current session is deleted. If the current
session is deleted, the earliest exist- ing session becomes
the new current session, otherwise the cur- rent session is
not changed. If the session being deleted is the only one, a
new session called default is created and becomes the
current session; note that this is a new session even if the
session being deleted is also called default. It is
recommended that sessions not be deleted while background
commands which use zftp are still active.</p>

<p>Parameters The following shell parameters are used by
zftp. Currently none of them are special.</p>

<p>ZFTP_TMOUT Integer. The time in seconds to wait for a
network operation to complete before returning an error. If
this is not set when the module is loaded, it will be given
the default value 60. A value of zero turns off timeouts. If
a timeout occurs on the control connection it will be
closed. Use a larger value if this occurs too
frequently.</p>

<p>ZFTP_IP Readonly. The IP address of the current
connection in dot nota- tion.</p>

<p>ZFTP_HOST Readonly. The hostname of the current remote
server. If the host was opened as an IP number, ZFTP_HOST
contains that instead; this saves the overhead for a name
lookup, as IP num- bers are most commonly used when a
nameserver is unavailable.</p>

<p>ZFTP_PORT Readonly. The number of the remote TCP port to
which the con- nection is open (even if the port was
originally specified as a named service). Usually this is
the standard FTP port, 21.</p>

<p>In the unlikely event that your system does not have the
appro- priate conversion functions, this appears in network
byte order. If your system is little-endian, the port then
consists of two swapped bytes and the standard port will be
reported as 5376. In that case, numeric ports passed to zftp
open will also need to be in this format.</p>

<p>ZFTP_SYSTEM Readonly. The system type string returned by
the server in response to an FTP SYST request. The most
interesting case is a string beginning &quot;UNIX Type:
L8&quot;, which ensures maximum compati- bility with a local
UNIX host.</p>

<p>ZFTP_TYPE Readonly. The type to be used for data
transfers , either A or I. Use the type subcommand to change
this.</p>

<p>ZFTP_USER Readonly. The username currently logged in, if
any.</p>

<p>ZFTP_ACCOUNT Readonly. The account name of the current
user, if any. Most servers do not require an account
name.</p>

<p>ZFTP_PWD Readonly. The current directory on the
server.</p>

<p>ZFTP_CODE Readonly. The three digit code of the last FTP
reply from the server as a string. This can still be read
after the connection is closed, and is not changed when the
current session changes.</p>

<p>ZFTP_REPLY Readonly. The last line of the last reply
sent by the server. This can still be read after the
connection is closed, and is not changed when the current
session changes.</p>

<p>ZFTP_SESSION Readonly. The name of the current FTP
session; see the descrip- tion of the session
subcommand.</p>

<p>ZFTP_PREFS A string of preferences for altering aspects
of zftps behaviour. Each preference is a single character.
The follow- ing are defined:</p>

<p>P Passive: attempt to make the remote server initiate
data transfers. This is slightly more efficient than
sendport mode. If the letter S occurs later in the string,
zftp will use sendport mode if passive mode is not
available.</p>

<p>S Sendport: initiate transfers by the FTP PORT command.
If this occurs before any P in the string, passive mode will
never be attempted.</p>

<p>D Dumb: use only the bare minimum of FTP commands. This
prevents the variables ZFTP_SYSTEM and ZFTP_PWD from being
set, and will mean all connections default to ASCII type. It
may prevent ZFTP_SIZE from being set during a transfer if
the server does not send it anyway (many servers do).</p>

<p>If ZFTP_PREFS is not set when zftp is loaded, it will be
set to a default of PS , i.e. use passive mode if available,
otherwise fall back to sendport mode.</p>

<p>ZFTP_VERBOSE A string of digits between 0 and 5
inclusive, specifying which responses from the server should
be printed. All responses go to standard error. If any of
the numbers 1 to 5 appear in the string, raw responses from
the server with reply codes beginning with that digit will
be printed to standard error. The first digit of the three
digit reply code is defined by RFC959 to cor- respond
to:</p>

<p>1. A positive preliminary reply.</p>

<p>2. A positive completion reply.</p>

<p>3. A positive intermediate reply.</p>

<p>4. A transient negative completion reply.</p>

<p>5. A permanent negative completion reply.</p>

<p>It should be noted that, for unknown reasons, the reply
Service not available, which forces termination of a
connection, is classified as 421, i.e. transient negative,
an interesting interpretation of the word transient.</p>

<p>The code 0 is special: it indicates that all but the
last line of multiline replies read from the server will be
printed to standard error in a processed format. By
convention, servers use this mechanism for sending
information for the user to read. The appropriate reply
code, if it matches the same response, takes priority.</p>

<p>If ZFTP_VERBOSE is not set when zftp is loaded, it will
be set to the default value 450, i.e., messages destined for
the user and all errors will be printed. A null string is
valid and specifies that no messages should be printed.</p>

<p>Functions zftp_chpwd If this function is set by the
user, it is called every time the directory changes on the
server, including when a user is logged in, or when a
connection is closed. In the last case, $ZFTP_PWD will be
unset; otherwise it will reflect the new directory.</p>

<p>zftp_progress If this function is set by the user, it
will be called during a get, put or append operation each
time sufficient data has been received from the host. During
a get, the data is sent to stan- dard output, so it is vital
that this function should write to standard error or
directly to the terminal, not to standard out- put.</p>

<p>When it is called with a transfer in progress, the
following additional shell parameters are set:</p>

<p>ZFTP_FILE The name of the remote file being transferred
from or to.</p>

<p>ZFTP_TRANSFER A G for a get operation and a P for a put
operation.</p>

<p>ZFTP_SIZE The total size of the complete file being
transferred: the same as the first value provided by the
remote and local subcommands for a particular file. If the
server cannot supply this value for a remote file being
retrieved, it will not be set. If input is from a pipe the
value may be incorrect and correspond simply to a full pipe
buffer.</p>

<p>ZFTP_COUNT The amount of data so far transferred; a
number between zero and $ZFTP_SIZE, if that is set. This
number is always available.</p>

<p>The function is initially called with ZFTP_TRANSFER set
appro- priately and ZFTP_COUNT set to zero. After the
transfer is fin- ished, the function will be called one more
time with ZFTP_TRANSFER set to GF or PF, in case it wishes
to tidy up. It is otherwise never called twice with the same
value of ZFTP_COUNT.</p>

<p>Sometimes the progress meter may cause disruption. It is
up to the user to decide whether the function should be
defined and to use unfunction when necessary.</p>

<p>Problems A connection may not be opened in the left hand
side of a pipe as this occurs in a subshell and the file
information is not updated in the main shell. In the case of
type or mode changes or closing the connec- tion in a
subshell, the information is returned but variables are not
updated until the next call to zftp. Other status changes in
subshells will not be reflected by changes to the variables
(but should be other- wise harmless).</p>

<p>Deleting sessions while a zftp command is active in the
background can have unexpected effects, even if it does not
use the session being deleted. This is because all shell
subprocesses share information on the state of all
connections, and deleting a session changes the order- ing
of that information.</p>

<p>On some operating systems, the control connection is not
valid after a fork(), so that operations in subshells, on
the left hand side of a pipeline, or in the background are
not possible, as they should be. This is presumably a bug in
the operating system.</p>

<p>THE ZSH/ZLE MODULE The zsh/zle module contains the Zsh
Line Editor. See zshzle(1).</p>

<p>THE ZSH/ZLEPARAMETER MODULE The zsh/zleparameter module
defines two special parameters that can be used to access
internal information of the Zsh Line Editor (see zsh-
zle(1)).</p>

<p>keymaps This array contains the names of the keymaps
currently defined.</p>

<p>widgets This associative array contains one entry per
widget defined. The name of the widget is the key and the
value gives informa- tion about the widget. It is either the
string builtin for builtin widgets, a string of the form
user:name for user-defined widgets, where name is the name
of the shell func- tion implementing the widget, or it is a
string of the form completion:type:name, for completion
widgets. In the last case type is the name of the builtin
widgets the completion widget imitates in its behavior and
name is the name of the shell func- tion implementing the
completion widget.</p>

<p>THE ZSH/ZPROF MODULE When loaded, the zsh/zprof causes
shell functions to be profiled. The profiling results can be
obtained with the zprof builtin command made available by
this module. There is no way to turn profiling off other
than unloading the module.</p>

<p>zprof [ -c ] Without the -c option, zprof lists
profiling results to standard output. The format is
comparable to that of commands like gprof.</p>

<p>At the top there is a summary listing all functions that
were called at least once. This summary is sorted in
decreasing order of the amount of time spent in each. The
lines contain the number of the function in order, which is
used in other parts of the list in suffixes of the form
[num] .RE, then the number of calls made to the function.
The next three columns list the time in milliseconds spent
in the function and its descendants, the average time in
milliseconds spent in the func- tion and its descendants per
call and the percentage of time spent in all shell functions
used in this function and its descendants. The following
three columns give the same informa- tion, but counting only
the time spent in the function itself. The final column
shows the name of the function.</p>

<p>After the summary, detailed information about every
function that was invoked is listed, sorted in decreasing
order of the amount of time spent in each function and its
descendants. Each of these entries consists of descriptions
for the functions that called the function described, the
function itself, and the functions that were called from it.
The description for the function itself has the same format
as in the summary (and shows the same information). The
other lines dont show the number of the function at the
beginning and have their function named indented to make it
easier to distinguish the line showing the function
described in the section from the surrounding lines.</p>

<p>The information shown in this case is almost the same as
in the summary, but only refers to the call hierarchy being
displayed. For example, for a calling function the column
showing the total running time lists the time spent in the
described function and its descendants only for the times
when it was called from that particular calling function.
Likewise, for a called function, this columns lists the
total time spent in the called function and its descendants
only for the times when it was called from the function
described.</p>

<p>Also in this case, the column showing the number of
calls to a function also shows a slash and then the total
number of invoca- tions made to the called function.</p>

<p>As long as the zsh/zprof module is loaded, profiling
will be done and multiple invocations of the zprof builtin
command will show the times and numbers of calls since the
module was loaded. With the -c option, the zprof builtin
command will reset its internal counters and will not show
the listing. )</p>

<p>THE ZSH/ZPTY MODULE The zsh/zpty module offers one
builtin:</p>

<p>zpty [ -e ] [ -b ] name [ arg ... ] The arguments
following name are concatenated with spaces between, then
executed as a command, as if passed to the eval builtin. The
command runs under a newly assigned pseudo-termi- nal; this
is useful for running commands non-interactively which
expect an interactive environment. The name is not part of
the command, but is used to refer to this command in later
calls to zpty.</p>

<p>With the -e option, the pseudo-terminal is set up so
that input characters are echoed.</p>

<p>With the -b option, input to and output from the
pseudo-terminal are made non-blocking.</p>

<p>zpty -d [ names ... ] The second form, with the -d
option, is used to delete commands previously started, by
supplying a list of their names. If no names are given, all
commands are deleted. Deleting a command causes the HUP
signal to be sent to the corresponding process.</p>

<p>zpty -w [ -n ] name [ strings ... ] The -w option can be
used to send the to command name the given strings as input
(separated by spaces). If the -n option is not given, a
newline is added at the end.</p>

<p>If no strings are provided, the standard input is copied
to the pseudo-terminal; this may stop before copying the
full input if the pseudo-terminal is non-blocking.</p>

<p>Note that the command under the pseudo-terminal sees
this input as if it were typed, so beware when sending
special tty driver characters such as word-erase, line-kill,
and end-of-file.</p>

<p>zpty -r [ -mt ] name [ param [ pattern ] ] The -r option
can be used to read the output of the command name. With
only a name argument, the output read is copied to the
standard output. Unless the pseudo-terminal is non-block-
ing, copying continues until the command under the
pseudo-termi- nal exits; when non-blocking, only as much
output as is immedi- ately available is copied. The return
status is zero if any output is copied.</p>

<p>When also given a param argument, at most one line is
read and stored in the parameter named param. Less than a
full line may be read if the pseudo-terminal is
non-blocking. The return sta- tus is zero if at least one
character is stored in param.</p>

<p>If a pattern is given as well, output is read until the
whole string read matches the pattern, even in the
non-blocking case. The return status is zero if the string
read matches the pat- tern, or if the command has exited but
at least one character could still be read. If the option -m
is present, the return status is zero only if the pattern
matches. As of this writing, a maximum of one megabyte of
output can be consumed this way; if a full megabyte is read
without matching the pattern, the return status is
non-zero.</p>

<p>In all cases, the return status is non-zero if nothing
could be read, and is 2 if this is because the command has
finished.</p>

<p>If the -r option is combined with the -t option, zpty
tests whether output is available before trying to read. If
no output is available, zpty immediately returns the status
1. When used with a pattern, the behaviour on a failed poll
is similar to when the command has exited: the return value
is zero if at least one character could still be read even
if the pattern failed to match.</p>

<p>zpty -t name The -t option without the -r option can be
used to test whether the command name is still running. It
returns a zero status if the command is running and a
non-zero value otherwise.</p>

<p>zpty [ -L ] The last form, without any arguments, is
used to list the com- mands currently defined. If the -L
option is given, this is done in the form of calls to the
zpty builtin.</p>

<p>THE ZSH/ZSELECT MODULE The zsh/zselect module makes
available one builtin command:</p>

<p>zselect [ -rwe -t timeout -a array ] [ fd ... ] The
zselect builtin is a front-end to the select system call,
which blocks until a file descriptor is ready for reading or
writing, or has an error condition, with an optional
timeout. If this is not available on your system, the
command prints an error message and returns status 2 (normal
errors return status 1). For more information, see your
systems documentation for select(3). Note there is no
connection with the shell builtin of the same name.</p>

<p>Arguments and options may be intermingled in any order.
Non-option arguments are file descriptors, which must be
decimal integers. By default, file descriptors are to be
tested for reading, i.e. zselect will return when data is
available to be read from the file descriptor, or more
precisely, when a read operation from the file descriptor
will not block. After a -r, -w and -e, the given file
descriptors are to be tested for read- ing, writing, or
error conditions. These options and an arbi- trary list of
file descriptors may be given in any order.</p>

<p>(The presence of an error condition is not well defined
in the documentation for many implementations of the select
system call. According to recent versions of the POSIX
specification, it is really an exception condition, of which
the only standard example is out-of-band data received on a
socket. So zsh users are unlikely to find the -e option
useful.)</p>

<p>The option -t timeout specifies a timeout in hundredths
of a second. This may be zero, in which case the file
descriptors will simply be polled and zselect will return
immediately. It is possible to call zselect with no file
descriptors and a non-zero timeout for use as a
finer-grained replacement for sleep ; not, however, the
return status is always 1 for a time- out.</p>

<p>The option -a array indicates that array should be set
to indicate the file descriptor(s) which are ready. If the
option is not given, the array reply will be used for this
purpose. The array will contain a string similar to the
arguments for zselect. For example,</p>

<p>zselect -t 0 -r 0 -w 1</p>

<p>might return immediately with status 0 and $reply
containing -r 0 -w 1 to show that both file descriptors are
ready for the requested operations.</p>

<p>The option -A assoc indicates that the associative array
assoc should be set to indicate the file descriptor(s( which
are ready. This option overrides the option -a, nor will
reply be modified. The keys of assoc are the file
descriptors, and the corresponding values are any of the
characters rwe to indicate the condition.</p>

<p>The command returns status 0 if some file descriptors
are ready for reading. If the operation timed out, or a
timeout of 0 was given and no file descriptors were ready,
or there was an error, it returns status 1 and the array
will not be set (nor modified in any way). If there was an
error in the select operation the appropriate error message
is printed.</p>

<p>THE ZSH/ZUTIL MODULE The zsh/zutil module only adds some
builtins:</p>

<p>zstyle [ -L [ pattern [ style ] ] ] zstyle [ -e | - | --
] pattern style strings ... zstyle -d [ pattern [ styles ...
] ] zstyle -g name [ pattern [ style ] ] zstyle -abs context
style name [ sep ] zstyle -Tt context style [ strings ...]
zstyle -m context style pattern This builtin command is used
to define and lookup styles. Styles are pairs of names and
values, where the values consist of any number of strings.
They are stored together with pat- terns and lookup is done
by giving a string, called the con- text, which is compared
to the patterns. The definition stored for the first
matching pattern will be returned.</p>

<p>For ordering of comparisons, patterns are searched from
most specific to least specific, and patterns that are
equally spe- cific keep the order in which they were
defined. A pattern is considered to be more specific than
another if it contains more components (substrings separated
by colons) or if the patterns for the components are more
specific, where simple strings are considered to be more
specific than patterns and complex pat- terns are considered
to be more specific than the pattern *.</p>

<p>The first form (without arguments) lists the
definitions. Styles are shown in alphabetic order and
patterns are shown in the order zstyle will test them.</p>

<p>If the -L option is given, listing is done in the form
of calls to zstyle. The optional first argument is a pattern
which will be matched against the string supplied as the
pattern for the context; note that this means, for example,
zstyle -L &quot;:comple- tion:*&quot; will match any
supplied pattern beginning :comple- tion: , not just
&quot;:completion:*&quot;: use &quot;:completion*&quot; to
match that. The optional second argument limits the output
to a spe- cific style (not a pattern). -L is not compatible
with any other options.</p>

<p>The other forms are the following:</p>

<p>zstyle [ - | -- | -e ] pattern style strings ... Defines
the given style for the pattern with the strings as the
value. If the -e option is given, the strings will be
concatenated (separated by spaces) and the resulting string
will be evaluated (in the same way as it is done by the eval
builtin command) when the style is looked up. In this case
the parameter reply must be assigned to set the strings
returned after the evalua- tion. Before evaluating the
value, reply is unset, and if it is still unset after the
evaluation, the style is treated as if it were not set.</p>

<p>zstyle -d [ pattern [ styles ... ] ] Delete style
definitions. Without arguments all defini- tions are
deleted, with a pattern all definitions for that pattern are
deleted and if any styles are given, then only those styles
are deleted for the pattern.</p>

<p>zstyle -g name [ pattern [ style ] ] Retrieve a style
definition. The name is used as the name of an array in
which the results are stored. Without any further arguments,
all patterns defined are returned. With a pattern the styles
defined for that pattern are returned and with both a
pattern and a style, the value strings of that combination
is returned.</p>

<p>The other forms can be used to look up or test
patterns.</p>

<p>zstyle -s context style name [ sep ] The parameter name
is set to the value of the style interpreted as a string. If
the value contains several strings they are concatenated
with spaces (or with the sep string if that is given)
between them.</p>

<p>zstyle -b context style name The value is stored in name
as a boolean, i.e. as the string yes if the value has only
one string and that string is equal to one of yes, true, on,
or 1. If the value is any other string or has more than one
string, the parameter is set to no.</p>

<p>zstyle -a context style name The value is stored in name
as an array. If name is declared as an associative array,
the first, third, etc. strings are used as the keys and the
other strings are used as the values.</p>

<p>zstyle -t context style [ strings ...] zstyle -T context
style [ strings ...] Test the value of a style, i.e. the -t
option only returns a status (sets $?). Without any strings
the return status is zero if the style is defined for at
least one matching pattern, has only one string in its
value, and that is equal to one of true, yes , on or 1 . If
any strings are given the status is zero if and only if at
least one of the strings is equal to at least one of the
strings in the value. If the style is not defined, the
status is 2.</p>

<p>The -T option tests the values of the style like -t, but
it returns status zero (rather than 2) if the style is not
defined for any matching pattern.</p>

<p>zstyle -m context style pattern Match a value. Returns
status zero if the pattern matches at least one of the
strings in the value.</p>

<p>zformat -f param format specs ... zformat -a array sep
specs ... This builtin provides two different forms of
formatting. The first form is selected with the -f option.
In this case the for- mat string will be modified by
replacing sequences starting with a percent sign in it with
strings from the specs. Each spec should be of the form
char:string which will cause every appearance of the
sequence %char in format to be replaced by the string. The %
sequence may also contain optional minimum and maximum field
width specifications between the % and the char in the form
%min.maxc, i.e. the minimum field width is given first and
if the maximum field width is used, it has to be preceded by
a dot. Specifying a minimum field width makes the result be
padded with spaces to the right if the string is shorter
than the requested width. Padding to the left can be
achieved by giving a negative minimum field width. If a
maximum field width is specified, the string will be
truncated after that many characters. After all % sequences
for the given specs have been processed, the resulting
string is stored in the parameter param.</p>

<p>The %-escapes also understand ternary expressions in the
form used by prompts. The % is followed by a ( and then an
ordinary format specifier character as described above.
There may be a set of digits either before or after the (;
these specify a test number, which defaults to zero.
Negative numbers are also allowed. An arbitrary delimiter
character follows the format specifier, which is followed by
a piece of true text, the delimiter character again, a piece
of false text, and a closing parenthesis. The complete
expression (without the dig- its) thus looks like
%(X.text1.text2), except that the . character is arbitrary.
The value given for the format speci- fier in the
char:string expressions is evaluated as a mathemati- cal
expression, and compared with the test number. If they are
the same, text1 is output, else text2 is output. A
parenthesis may be escaped in text2 as %). Either of text1
or text2 may contain nested %-escapes.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>zformat -f REPLY &quot;The answer is%3(c.yes.no.&quot;
c:3</p>

<p>outputs &quot;The answer is yes.&quot; to REPLY since
the value for the format specifier c is 3, agreeing with the
digit argument to the ternary expression.</p>

<p>The second form, using the -a option, can be used for
aligning strings. Here, the specs are of the form left:right
where left and right are arbitrary strings. These strings
are modified by replacing the colons by the sep string and
padding the left strings with spaces to the right so that
the sep strings in the result (and hence the right strings
after them) are all aligned if the strings are printed below
each other. All strings without a colon are left unchanged
and all strings with an empty right string have the trailing
colon removed. In both cases the lengths of the strings are
not used to determine how the other strings are to be
aligned. The resulting strings are stored in the array.</p>

<p>zregexparse This implements some internals of the
_regex_arguments function.</p>

<p>zparseopts [ -D ] [ -K ] [ -E ] [ -a array ] [ -A assoc
] specs This builtin simplifies the parsing of options in
positional parameters, i.e. the set of arguments given by
$*. Each spec describes one option and must be of the form
opt[=array]. If an option described by opt is found in the
positional parameters it is copied into the array specified
with the -a option; if the optional =array is given, it is
instead copied into that array.</p>

<p>Note that it is an error to give any spec without an
=array unless one of the -a or -A options is used.</p>

<p>Unless the -E option is given, parsing stops at the
first string that isnt described by one of the specs. Even
with -E, parsing always stops at a positional parameter
equal to - or --.</p>

<p>The opt description must be one of the following. Any of
the special characters can appear in the option name
provided it is preceded by a backslash.</p>

<p>name name+ The name is the name of the option without
the leading -. To specify a GNU-style long option, one of
the usual two leading - must be included in name; for exam-
ple, a --file option is represented by a name of -file.</p>

<p>If a + appears after name, the option is appended to
array each time it is found in the positional parameters;
without the + only the last occurrence of the option is
preserved.</p>

<p>If one of these forms is used, the option takes no argu-
ment, so parsing stops if the next positional parameter does
not also begin with - (unless the -E option is used).</p>

<p>name: name:- name:: If one or two colons are given, the
option takes an argu- ment; with one colon, the argument is
mandatory and with two colons it is optional. The argument
is appended to the array after the option itself.</p>

<p>An optional argument is put into the same array element
as the option name (note that this makes empty strings as
arguments indistinguishable). A mandatory argument is added
as a separate element unless the :- form is used, in which
case the argument is put into the same element.</p>

<p>A + as described above may appear between the name and
the first colon.</p>

<p>The options of zparseopts itself are:</p>

<p>-a array As described above, this names the default
array in which to store the recognised options.</p>

<p>-A assoc If this is given, the options and their values
are also put into an associative array with the option names
as keys and the argu- ments (if any) as the values.</p>

<p>-D If this option is given, all options found are
removed from the positional parameters of the calling shell
or shell function, up to but not including any not described
by the specs. This is similar to using the shift
builtin.</p>

<p>-K With this option, the arrays specified with the -a
and -A options and with the =array forms are kept unchanged
when none of the specs for them is used. This allows
assignment of default values to them before calling
zparseopts.</p>

<p>-E This changes the parsing rules to not stop at the
first string that isnt described by one of the specs. It can
be used to test for or (if used together with -D) extract
options and their arguments, ignoring all other options and
arguments that may be in the positional parameters.</p>

<p>For example,</p>

<p>set -- -a -bx -c y -cz baz -cend zparseopts a=foo b:=bar
c+:=bar</p>

<p>will have the effect of</p>

<p>foo=(-a) bar=(-b x -c y -c z)</p>

<p>The arguments from baz on will not be used.</p>

<p>As an example for the -E option, consider:</p>

<p>set -- -a x -b y -c z arg1 arg2 zparseopts -E -D
b:=bar</p>

<p>will have the effect of</p>

<p>bar=(-b y) set -- -a x -c z arg1 arg2</p>

<p>I.e., the option -b and its arguments are taken from the
positional parameters and put into the array bar.
ZSHCALSYS(1) ZSHCALSYS(1)</p>

<p>NAME zshcalsys - zsh calendar system</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The shell is supplied with a series of
functions to replace and enhance the traditional Unix
calendar programme, which warns the user of immi- nent or
future events, details of which are stored in a text file
(typ- ically calendar in the user s home directory). The
version provided here includes a mechanism for alerting the
user when an event is due.</p>

<p>In addition a function age is provided that can be used
in a glob qual- ifier; it allows files to be selected based
on their modification times.</p>

<p>The format of the calendar file and the dates used there
in and in the age function are described first, then the
functions that can be called to examine and modify the
calendar file.</p>

<p>The functions here depend on the availability of the
zsh/datetime mod- ule which is usually installed with the
shell. The library function strptime() must be available; it
is present on most recent operating systems.</p>

<p>FILE AND DATE FORMATS Calendar File Format The calendar
file is by default ~/calendar. This can be configured by the
calendar-file style, see the section STYLES below. The basic
for- mat consists of a series of separate lines, with no
indentation, each including a date and time specification
followed by a description of the event.</p>

<p>Various enhancements to this format are supported, based
on the syntax of Emacs calendar mode. An indented line
indicates a continuation line that continues the description
of the event from the preceding line (note the date may not
be continued in this way). An initial ampersand (&amp;) is
ignored for compatibility.</p>

<p>An indented line on which the first non-whitespace
character is # is not displayed with the calendar entry, but
is still scanned for infor- mation. This can be used to hide
information useful to the calendar system but not to the
user, such as the unique identifier used by cal-
endar_add.</p>

<p>The Emacs extension that a date with no description may
refer to a num- ber of succeeding events at different times
is not supported.</p>

<p>Unless the done-file style has been altered, any events
which have been processed are appended to the file with the
same name as the calendar file with the suffix .done, hence
~/calendar.done by default.</p>

<p>An example is shown below.</p>

<p>Date Format The format of the date and time is designed
to allow flexibility with- out admitting ambiguity. (The
words date and time are both used in the documentation
below; except where specifically noted this implies a string
that may include both a date and a time specification.) Note
that there is no localization support; month and day names
must be in English and separator characters are fixed.
Matching is case insensi- tive, and only the first three
letters of the names are significant, although as a special
case a form beginning &quot;month&quot; does not match
&quot;Monday&quot;. Furthermore, time zones are not handled;
all times are assumed to be local.</p>

<p>It is recommended that, rather than exploring the
intricacies of the system, users find a date format that is
natural to them and stick to it. This will avoid unexpected
effects. Various key facts should be noted.</p>

<p>&middot; In particular, note the confusion between
month/day/year and day/month/year when the month is numeric;
these formats should be avoided if at all possible. Many
alternatives are available.</p>

<p>&middot; The year must be given in full to avoid
confusion, and only years from 1900 to 2099 inclusive are
matched.</p>

<p>The following give some obvious examples; users finding
here a format they like and not subject to vagaries of style
may skip the full description. As dates and times are
matched separately (even though the time may be embedded in
the date), any date format may be mixed with any format for
the time of day provide the separators are clear
(whitespace, colons, commas).</p>

<p>2007/04/03 13:13 2007/04/03:13:13 2007/04/03 1:13 pm 3rd
April 2007, 13:13 April 3rd 2007 1:13 p.m. Apr 3, 2007 13:13
Tue Apr 03 13:13:00 2007 13:13 2007/apr/3</p>

<p>More detailed rules follow.</p>

<p>Times are parsed and extracted before dates. They must
use colons to separate hours and minutes, though a dot is
allowed before seconds if they are present. This limits time
formats to the following:</p>

<p>&middot; HH:MM[:SS[.FFFFF]] [am|pm|a.m.|p.m.]</p>

<p>&middot; HH:MM.SS[.FFFFF] [am|pm|a.m.|p.m.]</p>

<p>Here, square brackets indicate optional elements,
possibly with alter- natives. Fractions of a second are
recognised but ignored. For abso- lute times (the normal
format require by the calendar file and the age function) a
date is mandatory but a time of day is not; the time
returned is at the start of the date. One variation is
allowed: if a.m. or p.m. or one of their variants is
present, an hour without a minute is allowed, e.g. 3
p.m..</p>

<p>Time zones are not handled, though if one is matched
following a time specification it will be removed to allow a
surrounding date to be parsed. This only happens if the
format of the timezone is not too unusual. The following are
examples of forms that are understood:</p>

<p>+0100 GMT GMT-7 CET+1CDT</p>

<p>Any part of the timezone that is not numeric must have
exactly three capital letters in the name.</p>

<p>Dates suffer from the ambiguity between DD/MM/YYYY and
MM/DD/YYYY. It is recommended this form is avoided with
purely numeric dates, but use of ordinals, eg. 3rd/04/2007,
will resolve the ambiguity as the ordinal is always parsed
as the day of the month. Years must be four digits (and the
first two must be 19 or 20); 03/04/08 is not recognised.
Other numbers may have leading zeroes, but they are not
required. The following are handled:</p>

<p>&middot; YYYY/MM/DD</p>

<p>&middot; YYYY-MM-DD</p>

<p>&middot; YYYY/MNM/DD</p>

<p>&middot; YYYY-MNM-DD</p>

<p>&middot; DD[th|st|rd] MNM[,] [ YYYY ]</p>

<p>&middot; MNM DD[th|st|rd][,] [ YYYY ]</p>

<p>&middot; DD[th|st|rd]/MM[,] YYYY</p>

<p>&middot; DD[th|st|rd]/MM/YYYY</p>

<p>&middot; MM/DD[th|st|rd][,] YYYY</p>

<p>&middot; MM/DD[th|st|rd]/YYYY</p>

<p>Here, MNM is at least the first three letters of a month
name, matched case-insensitively. The remainder of the month
name may appear but its contents are irrelevant, so
janissary, febrile, martial, apricot, maybe, junta, etc. are
happily handled.</p>

<p>Where the year is shown as optional, the current year is
assumed. There are only two such cases, the form Jun 20 or
14 September (the only two commonly occurring forms, apart
from a &quot;the&quot; in some forms of English, which isn t
currently supported). Such dates will of course become
ambiguous in the future, so should ideally be avoided.</p>

<p>Times may follow dates with a colon, e.g.
1965/07/12:09:45; this is in order to provide a format with
no whitespace. A comma and whitespace are allowed, e.g.
1965/07/12, 09:45. Currently the order of these sep- arators
is not checked, so illogical formats such as 1965/07/12, :
,09:45 will also be matched. For simplicity such variations
are not shown in the list above. Otherwise, a time is only
recognised as being associated with a date if there is only
whitespace in between, or if the time was embedded in the
date.</p>

<p>Days of the week are not normally scanned, but will be
ignored if they occur at the start of the date pattern only.
However, in contexts where it is useful to specify dates
relative to today, days of the week with no other date
specification may be given. The day is assumed to be either
today or within the past week. Likewise, the words yester-
day, today and tomorrow are handled. All matches are
case-insensitive. Hence if today is Monday, then Sunday is
equivalent to yesterday, Mon- day is equivalent to today,
but Tuesday gives a date six days ago. This is not generally
useful within the calendar file. Dates in this format may be
combined with a time specification; for example Tomorrow, 8
p.m..</p>

<p>For example, the standard date format:</p>

<p>Fri Aug 18 17:00:48 BST 2006</p>

<p>is handled by matching HH:MM:SS and removing it together
with the matched (but unused) time zone. This leaves the
following:</p>

<p>Fri Aug 18 2006</p>

<p>Fri is ignored and the rest is matched according to the
standard rules.</p>

<p>Relative Time Format In certain places relative times
are handled. Here, a date is not allowed; instead a
combination of various supported periods are allowed,
together with an optional time. The periods must be in order
from most to least significant.</p>

<p>In some cases, a more accurate calculation is possible
when there is an anchor date: offsets of months or years
pick the correct day, rather than being rounded, and it is
possible to pick a particular day in a month as (1st
Friday), etc., as described in more detail below.</p>

<p>Anchors are available in the following cases. If one or
two times are passed to the function calendar, the start
time acts an anchor for the end time when the end time is
relative (even if the start time is implicit). When
examining calendar files, the scheduled event being examined
anchors the warning time when it is given explicitly by
means of the WARN keyword; likewise, the scheduled event
anchors a repetition period when given by the RPT keyword,
so that specifications such as RPT 2 months, 3rd Thursday
are handled properly. Finally, the -R argu- ment to
calendar_scandate directly provides an anchor for relative
cal- culations.</p>

<p>The periods handled, with possible abbreviations
are:</p>

<p>Years years, yrs, ys, year, yr, y, yearly. A year is
365.25 days unless there is an anchor.</p>

<p>Months months, mons, mnths, mths, month, mon, mnth, mth,
monthly. Note that m, ms, mn, mns are ambiguous and are not
handled. A month is a period of 30 days rather than a
calendar month unless there is an anchor.</p>

<p>Weeks weeks, wks, ws, week, wk, w, weekly</p>

<p>Days days, dys, ds, day, dy, d, daily</p>

<p>Hours hours, hrs, hs, hour, hr, h, hourly</p>

<p>Minutes minutes, mins, minute, min, but not m, ms, mn or
mns</p>

<p>Seconds seconds, secs, ss, second, sec, s</p>

<p>Spaces between the numbers are optional, but are
required between items, although a comma may be used (with
or without spaces).</p>

<p>The forms yearly to hourly allow the number to be
omitted; it is assumed to be 1. For example, 1 d and daily
are equivalent. Note that using those forms with plurals is
confusing; 2 yearly is the same as 2 years, not twice
yearly, so it is recommended they only be used without
numbers.</p>

<p>When an anchor time is present, there is an extension to
handle regular events in the form of the nth someday of the
month. Such a specifica- tion must occur immediately after
any year and month specification, but before any time of
day, and must be in the form n(th|st|rd) day, for example
1st Tuesday or 3rd Monday. As in other places, days are
matched case insensitively, must be in English, and only the
first three letters are significant except that a form
beginning month does not match Monday . No attempt is made
to sanitize the resulting date; attempts to squeeze too many
occurrences into a month will push the day into the next
month (but in the obvious fashion, retaining the correct day
of the week).</p>

<p>Here are some examples:</p>

<p>30 years 3 months 4 days 3:42:41 14 days 5 hours
Monthly, 3rd Thursday 4d,10hr</p>

<p>Example Here is an example calendar file. It uses a
consistent date format, as recommended above.</p>

<p>The second entry has a continuation line. The third
entry has a con- tinuation line that will not be shown when
the entry is displayed, but the unique identifier will be
used by the calendar_add function when updating the event.
The fourth entry will produce a warning 30 minutes before
the event (to allow you to equip yourself appropriately).
The fifth entry repeats after a month on the 3rd Thursday,
i.e. June 15, 2006, at the same time.</p>

<p>USER FUNCTIONS This section describes functions that are
designed to be called directly by the user. The first part
describes those functions associ- ated with the users
calendar; the second part describes the use in glob
qualifiers.</p>

<p>Calendar system functions calendar [ -abdDsv ] [ -C
calfile ] [ -n num ] [ -S showprog ] [ [ start ] end ](
calendar -r [ -abdDrsv ] [ -C calfile ] [ -n num ] [ -S
showprog ] [ start ] Show events in the calendar.</p>

<p>With no arguments, show events from the start of today
until the end of the next working day after today. In other
words, if today is Friday, Saturday, or Sunday, show up to
the end of the following Monday, otherwise show today and
tomorrow.</p>

<p>If end is given, show events from the start of today up
to the time and date given, which is in the format described
in the previous section. Note that if this is a date the
time is assumed to be midnight at the start of the date, so
that effec- tively this shows all events before the given
date.</p>

<p>end may start with a +, in which case the remainder of
the spec- ification is a relative time format as described
in the previous section indicating the range of time from
the start time that is to be included.</p>

<p>If start is also given, show events starting from that
time and date. The word now can be used to indicate the
current time.</p>

<p>To implement an alert when events are due, include
calendar -s in your ~/.zshrc file.</p>

<p>Options:</p>

<p>-a Show all items in the calendar, regardless of the
start and end.</p>

<p>-b Brief: don t display continuation lines (i.e.
indented lines following the line with the date/time), just
the first line.</p>

<p>-B lines Brief: display at most the first lines lines of
the cal- endar entry. -B 1 is equivalent to -b.</p>

<p>-C calfile Explicitly specify a calendar file instead of
the value of the calendar-file style or the the default
~/calendar.</p>

<p>-d Move any events that have passed from the calendar
file to the &quot;done&quot; file, as given by the done-file
style or the default which is the calendar file with .done
appended. This option is implied by the -s option.</p>

<p>-D Turns off the option -d, even if the -s option is
also present.</p>

<p>-n num, -num Show at least num events, if present in the
calendar file, regardless of the start and end.</p>

<p>-r Show all the remaining options in the calendar,
ignoring the given end time. The start time is respected;
any argument given is treated as a start time.</p>

<p>-s Use the shells sched command to schedule a timed
event that will warn the user when an event is due. Note
that the sched command only runs if the shell is at an
inter- active prompt; a foreground task blocks the scheduled
task from running until it is finished.</p>

<p>The timed event usually runs the programme calendar_show
to show the event, as described in the section UTILITY
FUNCTIONS below.</p>

<p>By default, a warning of the event is shown five minutes
before it is due. The warning period can be configured by
the style warn-time or for a single calendar entry by
including WARN reltime in the first line of the entry, where
reltime is one of the usual relative time formats.</p>

<p>A repeated event may be indicated by including RPT rel-
date in the first line of the entry. After the scheduled
event has been displayed it will be re-entered into the
calendar file at a time reldate after the existing event.
Note that this is currently the only use made of the repeat
count, so that it is not possible to query the schedule for
a recurrence of an event in the calendar until the previous
event has passed.</p>

<p>It is safe to run calendar -s to reschedule an existing
event (if the calendar file has changed, for example), and
also to have it running in multiples instances of the shell
since the calendar file is locked when in use.</p>

<p>By default, expired events are moved to the
&quot;done&quot; file; see the -d option. Use -D to prevent
this.</p>

<p>-S showprog Explicitly specify a programme to be used
for showing events instead of the value of the show-prog
style or the default calendar_show.</p>

<p>-v Verbose: show more information about stages of
process- ing. This is useful for confirming that the
function has successfully parsed the dates in the calendar
file.</p>

<p>calendar_add [ -BL ] event ... Adds a single event to
the calendar in the appropriate location. The event can
contain multiple lines, as described in the sec- tion
Calendar File Format above. Using this function ensures that
the calendar file is sorted in date and time order. It also
makes special arrangements for locking the file while it is
altered. The old calendar is left in a file with the suffix
.old.</p>

<p>The option -B indicates that backing up the calendar
file will be handled by the caller and should not be
performed by calen- dar_add. The option -L indicates that
calendar_add does not need to lock the calendar file as it
is already locked. These options will not usually be needed
by users.</p>

<p>If the style reformat-date is true, the date and time of
the new entry will be rewritten into the standard date
format: see the descriptions of this style and the style
date-format.</p>

<p>The function can use a unique identifier stored with
each event to ensure that updates to existing events are
treated correctly. The entry should contain the word UID,
followed by whitespace, followed by a word consisting
entirely of hexadecimal digits of arbitrary length (all
digits are significant, including leading zeroes). As the
UID is not directly useful to the user, it is convenient to
hide it on an indented continuation line starting with a #,
for example:</p>

<p>Aug 31, 2007 09:30 Celebrate the end of the holidays #
UID 045B78A0</p>

<p>The second line will not be shown by the calendar
function.</p>

<p>calendar_edit This calls the user s editor to edit the
calendar file. The editor is given by the variable VISUAL,
if set, else the vari- able EDITOR. If the calendar
scheduler was running, then after editing the file calendar
-s is called to update it.</p>

<p>This function locks out the calendar system during the
edit. Hence it should be used to edit the calendar file if
there is any possibility of a calendar event occurring
meanwhile.</p>

<p>calendar_parse calendar-entry This is the internal
function that analyses the parts of a cal- endar entry,
which is passed as the only argument. The function returns
status 1 if the argument could not be parsed as a calen- dar
entry and status 2 if the wrong number of arguments were
passed; it also sets the parameter reply to an empty
associative array. Otherwise, it returns status 0 and sets
elements of the associative array reply as follows: time The
time as a string of digits in the same units as $EPOCHSEC-
ONDS text1 The text from the line not including the date and
time of the event, but including any WARN or RPT keywords
and values. warntime Any warning time given by the WARN
keyword as a string of digits containing the time at which
to warn in the same units as $EPOCHSECONDS. (Note this is an
absolute time, not the relative time passed down.) Not set
no WARN keyword and value were matched. warnstr The raw
string matched after the WARN keyword, else unset. rpttime
Any recurrence time given by the RPT keyword as a string of
dig- its containing the time of the recurrence in the same
units as $EPOCHSECONDS. (Note this is an absolute time.) Not
set if no RPT keyword and value were matched. rptstr The raw
string matched after the RPT keyword, else unset. text2 The
text from the line after removal of the date and any key-
words and values. )</p>

<p>calendar_showdate [ -r ] [ -f fmt ] date-spec ... The
given date-spec is interpreted and the corresponding date
and time printed. If the initial date-spec begins with a +
or - it is treated as relative to the current time;
date-specs after the first are treated as relative to the
date calculated so far and a leading + is optional in that
case. This allows one to use the system as a date
calculator. For example, calen- dar_showdate+1 month, 1st
Fridayshows the date of the first Friday of next month.</p>

<p>With the option -r nothing is printed but the value of
the date and time in seconds since the epoch is stored in
the parameter REPLY.</p>

<p>With the option -f fmt the given date/time conversion
format is passed to strftime; see notes on the date-format
style below.</p>

<p>In order to avoid ambiguity with negative relative date
specifi- cations, options must occur in separate words; in
other words, -r and -f should not be combined in the same
word.</p>

<p>calendar_sort Sorts the calendar file into date and time
order. The old calendar is left in a file with the suffix
.old.</p>

<p>Glob qualifiers The function age can be autoloaded and
use separately from the calendar system, although it uses
the function calendar_scandate for date for- matting. It
requires the zsh/stat builtin, which makes available the
builtin stat. This may conflict with an external programme
of the same name; if it does, the builtin may be disabled
for normal operation by including the following code in an
initialization file:</p>

<p>zmodload -i zsh/stat disable stat</p>

<p>age selects files having a given modification time for
use as a glob qualifier. The format of the date is the same
as that understood by the calendar system, described in the
section FILE AND DATE FORMATS above.</p>

<p>The function can take one or two arguments, which can be
supplied either directly as command or arguments, or
separately as shell parame- ters.</p>

<p>print *(e:age 2006/10/04 2006/10/09:)</p>

<p>The example above matches all files modified between the
start of those dates. The second argument may alternatively
be a relative time intro- duced by a +:</p>

<p>print *(e:age 2006/10/04 +5d:)</p>

<p>The example above is equivalent to the previous
example.</p>

<p>In addition to the special use of days of the week,
today and yester- day, times with no date may be specified;
these apply to today. Obvi- ously such uses become
problematic around midnight.</p>

<p>print *(e-age 12:00 13:30-)</p>

<p>The example above shows files modified between 12:00 and
13:00 today.</p>

<p>print *(e:age 2006/10/04:)</p>

<p>The example above matches all files modified on that
date. If the sec- ond argument is omitted it is taken to be
exactly 24 hours after the first argument (even if the first
argument contains a time).</p>

<p>print *(e-age 2006/10/04:10:15 2006/10/04:10:45-)</p>

<p>The example above supplies times. Note that whitespace
within the time and date specification must be quoted to
ensure age receives the cor- rect arguments, hence the use
of the additional colon to separate the date and time.</p>

<p>AGEREF1=2006/10/04:10:15 AGEREF2=2006/10/04:10:45 print
*(+age)</p>

<p>This shows the same example before using another form of
argument pass- ing. The dates and times in the parameters
AGEREF1 and AGEREF2 stay in effect until unset, but will be
overridden if any argument is passed as an explicit argument
to age. Any explicit argument causes both parame- ters to be
ignored.</p>

<p>STYLES The zsh style mechanism using the zstyle command
is describe in zshmod- ules(1). This is the same mechanism
used in the completion system.</p>

<p>The styles below are all examined in the context
:datetime:function:, for example :datetime:calendar:.</p>

<p>calendar-file The location of the main calendar. The
default is ~/calendar.</p>

<p>date-format A strftime format string (see strftime(3))
with the zsh exten- sions providing various numbers with no
leading zero or space if the number is a single digit as
described for the %D{string} prompt format in the section
EXPANSION OF PROMPT SEQUENCES in zshmisc(1).</p>

<p>This is used for outputting dates in calendar, both to
support the -v option and when adding recurring events back
to the cal- endar file, and in calendar_showdate as the
final output format.</p>

<p>If the style is not set, the default used is similar the
stan- dard system format as output by the date command (also
known as ctime format): %a %b %d %H:%M:%S %Z %Y.</p>

<p>done-file The location of the file to which events which
have passed are appended. The default is the calendar file
location with the suffix .done. The style may be set to an
empty string in which case a &quot;done&quot; file will not
be maintained.</p>

<p>reformat-date Boolean, used by calendar_add. If it is
true, the date and time of new entries added to the calendar
will be reformatted to the format given by the style
date-format or its default. Only the date and time of the
event itself is reformatted; any subsidiary dates and times
such as those associated with repeat and warning times are
left alone.</p>

<p>show-prog The programme run by calendar for showing
events. It will be passed the start time and stop time of
the events requested in seconds since the epoch followed by
the event text. Note that calendar -s uses a start time and
stop time equal to one another to indicate alerts for
specific events.</p>

<p>The default is the function calendar_show.</p>

<p>warn-time The time before an event at which a warning
will be displayed, if the first line of the event does not
include the text EVENT reltime. The default is 5
minutes.</p>

<p>UTILITY FUNCTIONS calendar_lockfiles Attempt to lock the
files given in the argument. To prevent problems with
network file locking this is done in an ad hoc fashion by
attempting to create a symbolic link to the file with the
name file.lockfile. No other system level functions are used
for locking, i.e. the file can be accessed and modified by
any utility that does not use this mechanism. In particular,
the user is not prevented from editing the calendar file at
the same time unless calendar_edit is used.</p>

<p>Three attempts are made to lock the file before giving
up. If the module zsh/zselect is available, the times of the
attempts are jittered so that multiple instances of the
calling function are unlikely to retry at the same time.</p>

<p>The files locked are appended to the array lockfiles,
which should be local to the caller.</p>

<p>If all files were successfully locked, status zero is
returned, else status one.</p>

<p>This function may be used as a general file locking
function, although this will only work if only this
mechanism is used to lock files.</p>

<p>calendar_read This is a backend used by various other
functions to parse the calendar file, which is passed as the
only argument. The array calendar_entries is set to the list
of events in the file; no pruning is done except that
ampersands are removed from the start of the line. Each
entry may contain multiple lines.</p>

<p>calendar_scandate This is a generic function to parse
dates and times that may be used separately from the
calendar system. The argument is a date or time
specification as described in the section FILE AND DATE
FORMATS above. The parameter REPLY is set to the number of
seconds since the epoch corresponding to that date or time.
By default, the date and time may occur anywhere within the
given argument.</p>

<p>Returns status zero if the date and time were
successfully parsed, else one.</p>

<p>Options: -a The date and time are anchored to the start
of the argu- ment; they will not be matched if there is
preceding text.</p>

<p>-A The date and time are anchored to both the start and
end of the argument; they will not be matched if the is any
other text in the argument.</p>

<p>-d Enable additional debugging output.</p>

<p>-m Minus. When -R anchor_time is also given the relative
time is calculated backwards from anchor_time.</p>

<p>-r The argument passed is to be parsed as a relative
time.</p>

<p>-R anchor_time The argument passed is to be parsed as a
relative time. The time is relative to anchor_time, a time
in seconds since the epoch, and the returned value is the
absolute time corresponding to advancing anchor_time by the
rela- tive time given. This allows lengths of months to be
correctly taken into account. If the final day does not
exist in the given month, the last day of the final month is
given. For example, if the anchor time is during 31st
January 2007 and the relative time is 1 month, the final
time is the same time of day during 28th February 2007.</p>

<p>-s In addition to setting REPLY, set REPLY2 to the
remainder of the argument after the date and time have been
stripped. This is empty if the option -A was given.</p>

<p>-t Allow a time with no date specification. The date is
assumed to be today. The behaviour is unspecified if the
iron tongue of midnight is tolling twelve.</p>

<p>calendar_show The function used by default to display
events. It accepts a start time and end time for events,
both in epoch seconds, and an event description.</p>

<p>The event is always printed to standard output. If the
command line editor is active (which will usually be the
case) the com- mand line will be redisplayed after the
output.</p>

<p>If the parameter DISPLAY is set and the start and end
times are the same (indicating a scheduled event), the
function uses the command xmessage to display a window with
the event details.</p>

<p>BUGS As the system is based entirely on shell functions
(with a little sup- port from the zsh/datetime module) the
mechanisms used are not as robust as those provided by a
dedicated calendar utility. Consequently the user should not
rely on the shell for vital alerts.</p>

<p>There is no calendar_delete function.</p>

<p>There is no localization support for dates and times,
nor any support for the use of time zones.</p>

<p>Relative periods of months and years do not take into
account the vari- able number of days.</p>

<p>The calendar_show function is currently hardwired to use
xmessage for displaying alerts on X Window System displays.
This should be config- urable and ideally integrate better
with the desktop.</p>

<p>calendar_lockfiles hangs the shell while waiting for a
lock on a file. If called from a scheduled task, it should
instead reschedule the event ZSHTCPSYS(1) ZSHTCPSYS(1)</p>

<p>that caused it.</p>

<p>NAME zshtcpsys - zsh tcp system</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION A module zsh/net/tcp is provided to provide
network I/O over TCP/IP from within the shell; see its
description in zshmodules(1) . This manual page describes a
function suite based on the module. If the module is
installed, the functions are usually installed at the same
time, in which case they will be available for autoloading
in the default function search path. In addition to the
zsh/net/tcp module, the zsh/zselect module is used to
implement timeouts on read opera- tions. For troubleshooting
tips, consult the corresponding advice for the zftp
functions described in zshftpsys(1) .</p>

<p>There are functions corresponding to the basic I/O
operations open, close, read and send, named tcp_open etc.,
as well as a function tcp_expect for pattern match analysis
of data read as input. The sys- tem makes it easy to receive
data from and send data to multiple named sessions at once.
In addition, it can be linked with the shells line editor in
such a way that input data is automatically shown at the
ter- minal. Other facilities available including logging,
filtering and configurable output prompts.</p>

<p>To use the system where it is available, it should be
enough to autoload -U tcp_open and run tcp_open as
documented below to start a session. The tcp_open function
will autoload the remaining functions.</p>

<p>TCP USER FUNCTIONS Basic I/O tcp_open [-qz] host port [
sess ] tcp_open [-qz] [ -s sess | -l sess,... ] ... tcp_open
[-qz] [-a fd | -f fd ] [ sess ] Open a new session. In the
first and simplest form, open a TCP connection to host host
at port port; numeric and symbolic forms are understood for
both.</p>

<p>If sess is given, this becomes the name of the session
which can be used to refer to multiple different TCP
connections. If sess is not given, the function will invent
a numeric name value (note this is not the same as the file
descriptor to which the session is attached). It is
recommended that session names not include funny characters,
where funny characters are not well-defined but certainly do
not include alphanumerics or underscores, and certainly do
include whitespace.</p>

<p>In the second case, one or more sessions to be opened
are given by name. A single session name is given after -s
and a comma-separated list after -l; both options may be
repeated as many times as necessary. A failure to open any
session causes tcp_open to abort. The host and port are read
from the file .ztcp_sessions in the same directory as the
user s zsh initiali- sation files, i.e. usually the home
directory, but $ZDOTDIR if that is set. The file consists of
lines each giving a session name and the corresponding host
and port, in that order (note the session name comes first,
not last), separated by whites- pace.</p>

<p>The third form allows passive and fake TCP connections.
If the option -a is used, its argument is a file descriptor
open for listening for connections. No function front-end is
provided to open such a file descriptor, but a call to ztcp
-l port will create one with the file descriptor stored in
the parameter $REPLY. The listening port can be closed with
ztcp -c fd. A call to tcp_open -a fd will block until a
remote TCP connec- tion is made to port on the local
machine. At this point, a session is created in the usual
way and is largely indistin- guishable from an active
connection created with one of the first two forms.</p>

<p>If the option -f is used, its argument is a file
descriptor which is used directly as if it were a TCP
session. How well the remainder of the TCP function system
copes with this depends on what actually underlies this file
descriptor. A regular file is likely to be unusable; a FIFO
(pipe) of some sort will work better, but note that it is
not a good idea for two different sessions to attempt to
read from the same FIFO at once.</p>

<p>If the option -q is given with any of the three forms,
tcp_open will not print informational messages, although it
will in any case exit with an appropriate status.</p>

<p>If the line editor (zle) is in use, which is typically
the case if the shell is interactive, tcp_open installs a
handler inside zle which will check for new data at the same
time as it checks for keyboard input. This is convenient as
the shell consumes no CPU time while waiting; the test is
performed by the operating system. Giving the option -z to
any of the forms of tcp_open prevents the handler from being
installed, so data must be read explicitly. Note, however,
this is not necessary for executing complete sets of send
and read commands from a function, as zle is not active at
this point. Generally speaking, the handler is only active
when the shell is waiting for input at a command prompt or
in the vared builtin. The option has no effect if zle is not
active; [[ -o zle]] will test for this.</p>

<p>The first session to be opened becomes the current
session and subsequent calls to tcp_open do not change it.
The current ses- sion is stored in the parameter $TCP_SESS;
see below for more detail about the parameters used by the
system.</p>

<p>The function tcp_on_open, if defined, is called when a
session is opened. See the description below.</p>

<p>tcp_close [-qn] [ -a | -l sess,... | sess ... ] Close
the named sessions, or the current session if none is given,
or all open sessions if -a is given. The options -l and -s
are both handled for consistency with tcp_open, although the
latter is redundant.</p>

<p>If the session being closed is the current one,
$TCP_SESS is unset, leaving no current session, even if
there are other ses- sions still open.</p>

<p>If the session was opened with tcp_open -f, the file
descriptor is closed so long as it is in the range 0 to 9
accessible directly from the command line. If the option -n
is given, no attempt will be made to close file descriptors
in this case. The -n option is not used for genuine ztcp
session; the file descriptors are always closed with the
session.</p>

<p>If the option -q is given, no informational messages
will be printed.</p>

<p>tcp_read [-bdq] [ -t TO ] [ -T TO ] [ -a | -u fd ... |
-l sess,... | -s sess ...] Perform a read operation on the
current session, or on a list of sessions if any are given
with -u, -l or -s, or all open ses- sions if the option -a
is given. Any of the -u, -l or -s options may be repeated or
mixed together. The -u option speci- fies a file descriptor
directly (only those managed by this sys- tem are useful),
the other two specify sessions as described for tcp_open
above.</p>

<p>The function checks for new data available on all the
sessions listed. Unless the -b option is given, it will not
block wait- ing for new data. Any one line of data from any
of the avail- able sessions will be read, stored in the
parameter $TCP_LINE, and displayed to standard output unless
$TCP_SILENT contains a non-empty string. When printed to
standard output the string $TCP_PROMPT will be shown at the
start of the line; the default form for this includes the
name of the session being read. See below for more
information on these parameters. In this mode, tcp_read can
be called repeatedly until it returns status 2 which
indicates all pending input from all specified sessions has
been handled.</p>

<p>With the option -b, equivalent to an infinite timeout,
the func- tion will block until a line is available to read
from one of the specified sessions. However, only a single
line is returned.</p>

<p>The option -d indicates that all pending input should be
drained. In this case tcp_read may process multiple lines in
the manner given above; only the last is stored in
$TCP_LINE, but the complete set is stored in the array
$tcp_lines. This is cleared at the start of each call to
tcp_read.</p>

<p>The options -t and -T specify a timeout in seconds,
which may be a floating point number for increased accuracy.
With -t the timeout is applied before each line read. With
-T, the timeout applies to the overall operation, possibly
including multiple read operations if the option -d is
present; without this option, there is no distinction
between -t and -T.</p>

<p>The function does not print informational messages, but
if the option -q is given, no error message is printed for a
non-exis- tent session.</p>

<p>A return status of 2 indicates a timeout or no data to
read. Any other non-zero return status indicates some error
condition.</p>

<p>See tcp_log for how to control where data is sent by
tcp_read.</p>

<p>tcp_send [-cnq] [ -s sess | -l sess,... ] data ...
tcp_send [-cnq] -a data ... Send the supplied data strings
to all the specified sessions in turn. The underlying
operation differs little from a print -r to the session s
file descriptor, although it attempts to pre- vent the shell
from dying owing to a SIGPIPE caused by an attempt to write
to a defunct session.</p>

<p>The option -c causes tcp_send to behave like cat. It
reads lines from standard input until end of input and sends
them in turn to the specified session(s) exactly as if they
were given as data arguments to individual tcp_send
commands.</p>

<p>The option -n prevents tcp_send from putting a newline
at the end of the data strings.</p>

<p>The remaining options all behave as for tcp_read.</p>

<p>The data arguments are not further processed once they
have been passed to tcp_send; they are simply passed down to
print -r.</p>

<p>If the parameter $TCP_OUTPUT is a non-empty string and
logging is enabled then the data sent to each session will
be echoed to the log file(s) with $TCP_OUTPUT in front where
appropriate, much in the manner of $TCP_PROMPT.</p>

<p>Session Management tcp_alias [-q] alias=sess ...
tcp_alias [-q] [ alias ] ... tcp_alias -d [-q] alias ...
This function is not particularly well tested.</p>

<p>The first form creates an alias for a session name;
alias can then be used to refer to the existing session
sess. As many aliases may be listed as required.</p>

<p>The second form lists any aliases specified, or all
aliases if none.</p>

<p>The third form deletes all the aliases listed. The
underlying sessions are not affected.</p>

<p>The option -q suppresses an inconsistently chosen subset
of error messages.</p>

<p>tcp_log [-asc] [ -n | -N ] [ logfile ] With an argument
logfile, all future input from tcp_read will be logged to
the named file. Unless -a (append) is given, this file will
first be truncated or created empty. With no argu- ments,
show the current status of logging.</p>

<p>With the option -s, per-session logging is enabled.
Input from tcp_read is output to the file logfile.sess. As
the session is automatically discriminated by the filename,
the contents are raw (no $TCP_PROMPT). The option -a applies
as above. Per-session logging and logging of all data in one
file are not mutually exclusive.</p>

<p>The option -c closes all logging, both complete and
per-session logs.</p>

<p>The options -n and -N respectively turn off or restore
output of data read by tcp_read to standard output; hence
tcp_log -cn turns off all output by tcp_read.</p>

<p>The function is purely a convenient front end to setting
the parameters $TCP_LOG, $TCP_LOG_SESS, $TCP_SILENT, which
are described below.</p>

<p>tcp_rename old new Rename session old to session new.
The old name becomes invalid.</p>

<p>tcp_sess [ sess [ command ... ] ] With no arguments,
list all the open sessions and associated file descriptors.
The current session is marked with a star. For use in
functions, direct access to the parameters $tcp_by_name,
$tcp_by_fd and $TCP_SESS is probably more conve- nient; see
below.</p>

<p>With a sess argument, set the current session to sess.
This is equivalent to changing $TCP_SESS directly.</p>

<p>With additional arguments, temporarily set the current
session while executing the string command .... The first
argument is re-evaluated so as to expand aliases etc., but
the remaining arguments are passed through as the appear to
tcp_sess. The original session is restored when tcp_sess
exits.</p>

<p>Advanced I/O tcp_command send-options ... send-arguments
... This is a convenient front-end to tcp_send. All
arguments are passed to tcp_send, then the function pauses
waiting for data. While data is arriving at least every
$TCP_TIMEOUT (default 0.3) seconds, data is handled and
printed out according to the cur- rent settings. Status 0 is
always returned.</p>

<p>This is generally only useful for interactive use, to
prevent the display becoming fragmented by output returned
from the con- nection. Within a programme or function it is
generally better to handle reading data by a more explicit
method.</p>

<p>tcp_expect [ -q ] [ -p var ] [ -t to | -T TO] [ -a | -s
sess ... | -l sess,... ] pattern ... Wait for input matching
any of the given patterns from any of the specified
sessions. Input is ignored until an input line matches one
of the given patterns; at this point status zero is
returned, the matching line is stored in $TCP_LINE, and the
full set of lines read during the call to tcp_expect is
stored in the array $tcp_expect_lines.</p>

<p>Sessions are specified in the same way as tcp_read: the
default is to use the current session, otherwise the
sessions specified by -a, -s, or -l are used.</p>

<p>Each pattern is a standard zsh extended-globbing
pattern; note that it needs to be quoted to avoid it being
expanded immedi- ately by filename generation. It must match
the full line, so to match a substring there must be a * at
the start and end. The line matched against includes the
$TCP_PROMPT added by tcp_read. It is possible to include the
globbing flags #b or #m in the patterns to make
backreferences available in the parameters $MATCH, $match,
etc., as described in the base zsh documentation on pattern
matching.</p>

<p>Unlike tcp_read, the default behaviour of tcp_expect is
to block indefinitely until the required input is found.
This can be modified by specifying a timeout with -t or -T;
these function as in tcp_read, specifying a per-read or
overall timeout, respectively, in seconds, as an integer or
floating-point num- ber. As tcp_read, the function returns
status 2 if a timeout occurs.</p>

<p>The function returns as soon as any one of the patterns
given match. If the caller needs to know which of the
patterns matched, the option -p var can be used; on return,
$var is set to the number of the pattern using ordinary zsh
indexing, i.e. the first is 1, and so on. Note the absence
of a $ in front of var. To avoid clashes, the parameter
cannot begin with _expect.</p>

<p>The option -q is passed directly down to tcp_read.</p>

<p>As all input is done via tcp_read, all the usual rules
about output of lines read apply. One exception is that the
parameter $tcp_lines will only reflect the line actually
matched by tcp_expect; use $tcp_expect_lines for the full
set of lines read during the function call.</p>

<p>tcp_proxy This is a simple-minded function to accept a
TCP connection and execute a command with I/O redirected to
the connection. Extreme caution should be taken as there is
no security whatso- ever and this can leave your computer
open to the world. Ide- ally, it should only be used behind
a firewall.</p>

<p>The first argument is a TCP port on which the function
will lis- ten.</p>

<p>The remaining arguments give a command and its arguments
to exe- cute with standard input, standard output and
standard error redirected to the file descriptor on which
the TCP session has been accepted. If no command is given, a
new zsh is started. This gives everyone on your network
direct access to your account, which in many cases will be a
bad thing.</p>

<p>The command is run in the background, so tcp_proxy can
then accept new connections. It continues to accept new
connections until interrupted.</p>

<p>tcp_spam [-ertv] [ -a | -s sess | -l sess,... ] cmd ...
Execute cmd ... for each session in turn. Note this executes
the command and arguments; it does not send the command line
as data unless the -t (transmit) option is given.</p>

<p>The sessions may be selected explicitly with the
standard -a, -s or -l options, or may be chosen implicitly.
If none of the three options is given the rules are: first,
if the array $tcp_spam_list is set, this is taken as the
list of sessions, otherwise all sessions are taken. Second,
any sessions given in the array $tcp_no_spam_list are
removed from the list of ses- sions.</p>

<p>Normally, any sessions added by the -a flag or when all
ses- sions are chosen implicitly are spammed in alphabetic
order; sessions given by the $tcp_spam_list array or on the
command line are spammed in the order given. The -r flag
reverses the order however it was arrived it.</p>

<p>The -v flag specifies that a $TCP_PROMPT will be output
before each session. This is output after any modification
to TCP_SESS by the user-defined tcp_on_spam function
described below. (Obviously that function is able to
generate its own output.)</p>

<p>If the option -e is present, the line given as cmd ...
is exe- cuted using eval, otherwise it is executed without
any further processing.</p>

<p>tcp_talk This is a fairly simple-minded attempt to force
input to the line editor to go straight to the default
TCP_SESSION.</p>

<p>An escape string, $TCP_TALK_ESCAPE, default :, is used
to allow access to normal shell operation. If it is on its
own at the start of the line, or followed only by
whitespace, the line editor returns to normal operation.
Otherwise, the string and any following whitespace are
skipped and the remainder of the line executed as shell
input without any change of the line edi- tors operating
mode.</p>

<p>The current implementation is somewhat deficient in
terms of use of the command history. For this reason, many
users will prefer to use some form of alternative approach
for sending data easily to the current session. One simple
approach is to alias some special character (such as %) to
tcp_command --.</p>

<p>tcp_wait The sole argument is an integer or floating
point number which gives the seconds to delay. The shell
will do nothing for that period except wait for input on all
TCP sessions by calling tcp_read -a. This is similar to the
interactive behaviour at the command prompt when zle
handlers are installed.</p>

<p>One-shotfile transfer tcp_point port tcp_shoot host port
This pair of functions provide a simple way to transfer a
file between two hosts within the shell. Note, however, that
bulk data transfer is currently done using cat. tcp_point
reads any data arriving at port and sends it to standard
output; tcp_shoot connects to port on host and sends its
standard input. Any unused port may be used; the standard
mechanism for picking a port is to think of a random
four-digit number above 1024 until one works.</p>

<p>To transfer a file from host woodcock to host springes,
on springes:</p>

<p>tcp_point 8091 &gt;output_file</p>

<p>and on woodcock:</p>

<p>tcp_shoot springes 8091 &lt;input_file</p>

<p>As these two functions do not require tcp_open to set up
a TCP connection first, they may need to be autoloaded
separately.</p>

<p>TCP USER-DEFINED FUNCTIONS Certain functions, if defined
by the user, will be called by the func- tion system in
certain contexts. This facility depends on the module
zsh/parameter, which is usually available in interactive
shells as the completion system depends on it. None of the
functions need be defined; they simply provide convenient
hooks when necessary.</p>

<p>Typically, these are called after the requested action
has been taken, so that the various parameters will reflect
the new state.</p>

<p>tcp_on_alias alias fd When an alias is defined, this
function will be called with two arguments: the name of the
alias, and the file descriptor of the corresponding
session.</p>

<p>tcp_on_awol sess fd If the function tcp_fd_handler is
handling input from the line editor and detects that the
file descriptor is no longer reusable, by default it removes
it from the list of file descriptors handled by this method
and prints a message. If the function tcp_on_awol is defined
it is called immediately before this point. It may return
status 100, which indicates that the normal handling should
still be performed; any other return sta- tus indicates that
no further action should be taken and the tcp_fd_handler
should return immediately with the given status. Typically
the action of tcp_on_awol will be to close the ses-
sion.</p>

<p>The variable TCP_INVALIDATE_ZLE will be a non-empty
string if it is necessary to invalidate the line editor
display using zle -I before printing output from the
function.</p>

<p>( AWOL is military jargon for absent without leave or
some variation. It has no pre-existing technical meaning
known to the author.)</p>

<p>tcp_on_close sess fd This is called with the name of a
session being closed and the file descriptor which
corresponded to that session. Both will be invalid by the
time the function is called.</p>

<p>tcp_on_open sess fd This is called after a new session
has been defined with the session name and file descriptor
as arguments. If it returns a non-zero status, opening the
session is assumed to fail and the session is closed again;
however, tcp_open will continue to attempt to open any
remaining sessions given on the command line.</p>

<p>tcp_on_rename oldsess fd newsess This is called after a
session has been renamed with the three arguments old
session name, file descriptor, new session name.</p>

<p>tcp_on_spam sess command ... This is called once for
each session spammed, just before a com- mand is executed
for a session by tcp_spam. The arguments are the session
name followed by the command list to be executed. If
tcp_spam was called with the option -t, the first command
will be tcp_send.</p>

<p>This function is called after $TCP_SESS is set to
reflect the session to be spammed, but before any use of it
is made. Hence it is possible to alter the value of
$TCP_SESS within this func- tion. For example, the session
arguments to tcp_spam could include extra information to be
stripped off and processed in tcp_on_spam.</p>

<p>If the function sets the parameter $REPLY to done, the
command line is not executed; in addition, no prompt is
printed for the -v option to tcp_spam.</p>

<p>tcp_on_unalias alias fd This is called with the name of
an alias and the corresponding sessions file descriptor
after an alias has been deleted.</p>

<p>TCP UTILITY FUNCTIONS The following functions are used
by the TCP function system but will rarely if ever need to
be called directly.</p>

<p>tcp_fd_handler This is the function installed by
tcp_open for handling input from within the line editor, if
that is required. It is in the format documented for the
builtin zle -F in zshzle(1) .</p>

<p>While active, the function sets the parameter
TCP_HANDLER_ACTIVE to 1. This allows shell code called
internally (for example, by setting tcp_on_read) to tell if
is being called when the shell is otherwise idle at the
editor prompt.</p>

<p>tcp_output [ -q ] -P prompt -F fd -S sess This function
is used for both logging and handling output to standard
output, from within tcp_read and (if $TCP_OUTPUT is set)
tcp_send.</p>

<p>The prompt to use is specified by -P; the default is the
empty string. It can contain: %c Expands to 1 if the session
is the current session, oth- erwise 0. Used with ternary
expressions such as %(c.-.+) to output + for the current
session and - otherwise.</p>

<p>%f Replaced by the sessions file descriptor.</p>

<p>%s Replaced by the session name.</p>

<p>%% Replaced by a single %.</p>

<p>The option -q suppresses output to standard output, but
not to any log files which are configured.</p>

<p>The -S and -F options are used to pass in the session
name and file descriptor for possible replacement in the
prompt.</p>

<p>TCP USER PARAMETERS Parameters follow the usual
convention that uppercase is used for scalars and integers,
while lowercase is used for normal and associa- tive array.
It is always safe for user code to read these parameters.
Some parameters may also be set; these are noted explicitly.
Others are included in this group as they are set by the
function system for the users benefit, i.e. setting them is
typically not useful but is benign.</p>

<p>It is often also useful to make settable parameters
local to a func- tion. For example, local TCP_SILENT=1
specifies that data read dur- ing the function call will not
be printed to standard output, regard- less of the setting
outside the function. Likewise, local TCP_SESS=sess sets a
session for the duration of a function, and local
TCP_PROMPT= specifies that no prompt is used for input
during the function.</p>

<p>tcp_expect_lines Array. The set of lines read during the
last call to tcp_expect, including the last ($TCP_LINE).</p>

<p>tcp_filter Array. May be set directly. A set of extended
globbing patterns which, if matched in tcp_output, will
cause the line not to be printed to standard output. The
patterns should be defined as described for the arguments to
tcp_expect. Output of line to log files is not affected.</p>

<p>TCP_HANDLER_ACTIVE Scalar. Set to 1 within
tcp_fd_handler to indicate to functions called recursively
that they have been called during an editor session.
Otherwise unset.</p>

<p>TCP_LINE The last line read by tcp_read, and hence also
tcp_expect.</p>

<p>TCP_LINE_FD The file descriptor from which $TCP_LINE was
read. ${tcp_by_fd[$TCP_LINE_FD]} will give the corresponding
session name.</p>

<p>tcp_lines Array. The set of lines read during the last
call to tcp_read, including the last ($TCP_LINE).</p>

<p>TCP_LOG May be set directly, although it is also
controlled by tcp_log. The name of a file to which output
from all sessions will be sent. The output is proceeded by
the usual $TCP_PROMPT. If it is not an absolute path name,
it will follow the users current directory.</p>

<p>TCP_LOG_SESS May be set directly, although it is also
controlled by tcp_log. The prefix for a set of files to
which output from each session separately will be sent; the
full filename is ${TCP_LOG_SESS}.sess. Output to each file
is raw; no prompt is added. If it is not an absolute path
name, it will follow the users current directory.</p>

<p>tcp_no_spam_list Array. May be set directly. See
tcp_spam for how this is used.</p>

<p>TCP_OUTPUT May be set directly. If a non-empty string,
any data sent to a session by tcp_send will be logged. This
parameter gives the prompt to be used in a file specified by
$TCP_LOG but not in a file generated from $TCP_LOG_SESS. The
prompt string has the same format as TCP_PROMPT and the same
rules for its use apply.</p>

<p>TCP_PROMPT May be set directly. Used as the prefix for
data read by tcp_read which is printed to standard output or
to the log file given by $TCP_LOG, if any. Any %s, %f or %%
occurring in the string will be replaced by the name of the
session, the ses- sion s underlying file descriptor, or a
single %, respec- tively. The expression %c expands to 1 if
the session being read is the current session, else 0; this
is most useful in ternary expressions such as %(c.-.+) which
outputs + if the session is the current one, else -.</p>

<p>TCP_READ_DEBUG May be set directly. If this has non-zero
length, tcp_read will give some limited diagnostics about
data being read.</p>

<p>TCP_SECONDS_START This value is created and initialised
to zero by tcp_open.</p>

<p>The functions tcp_read and tcp_expect use the shells
SECONDS parameter for their own timing purposes. If that
parameter is not of floating point type on entry to one of
the functions, it will create a local parameter SECONDS
which is floating point and set the parameter
TCP_SECONDS_START to the previous value of $SECONDS. If the
parameter is already floating point, it is used without a
local copy being created and TCP_SECONDS_START is not set.
As the global value is zero, the shell elapsed time is
guaranteed to be the sum of $SECONDS and
$TCP_SECONDS_START.</p>

<p>This can be avoided by setting SECONDS globally to a
floating point value using typeset -F SECONDS ; then the TCP
functions will never make a local copy and never set
TCP_SECONDS_START to a non-zero value.</p>

<p>TCP_SESS May be set directly. The current session; must
refer to one of the sessions established by tcp_open.</p>

<p>TCP_SILENT May be set directly, although it is also
controlled by tcp_log. If of non-zero length, data read by
tcp_read will not be written to standard output, though may
still be written to a log file.</p>

<p>tcp_spam_list Array. May be set directly. See the
description of the func- tion tcp_spam for how this is
used.</p>

<p>TCP_TALK_ESCAPE May be set directly. See the description
of the function tcp_talk for how this is used.</p>

<p>TCP_TIMEOUT May be set directly. Currently this is only
used by the func- tion tcp_command, see above.</p>

<p>TCP USER-DEFINED PARAMETERS The following parameters are
not set by the function system, but have a special effect if
set by the user.</p>

<p>tcp_on_read This should be an associative array; if it
is not, the behaviour is undefined. Each key is the name of
a shell function or other command, and the corresponding
value is a shell pattern (using EXTENDED_GLOB). Every line
read from a TCP session directly or indirectly using
tcp_read (which includes lines read by tcp_expect) is
compared against the pattern. If the line matches, the
command given in the key is called with two argu- ments: the
name of the session from which the line was read, and the
line itself.</p>

<p>If any function called to handle a line returns a
non-zero sta- tus, the line is not output. Thus a
tcp_on_read handler con- taining only the instruction return
1 can be used to suppress output of particular lines (see,
however, tcp_filter above). However, the line is still
stored in TCP_LINE and tcp_lines; this occurs after all
tcp_on_read processing.</p>

<p>TCP UTILITY PARAMETERS These parameters are controlled
by the function system; they may be read directly, but
should not usually be set by user code.</p>

<p>tcp_aliases Associative array. The keys are the names of
sessions estab- lished with tcp_open; each value is a
space-separated list of aliases which refer to that
session.</p>

<p>tcp_by_fd Associative array. The keys are session file
descriptors; each value is the name of that session.</p>

<p>tcp_by_name Associative array. The keys are the names of
sessions; each value is the file descriptor associated with
that session.</p>

<p>TCP EXAMPLES Here is a trivial example using a remote
calculator.</p>

<p>TO create a calculator server on port 7337 (see the dc
manual page for quite how infuriating the underlying command
is):</p>

<p>tcp_proxy 7337 dc</p>

<p>To connect to this from the same host with a session
also named dc:</p>

<p>tcp_open localhost 7337 dc</p>

<p>To send a command to the remote session and wait a short
while for out- put (assuming dc is the current session):</p>

<p>tcp_command 2 4 + p</p>

<p>To close the session:</p>

<p>tcp_close</p>

<p>The tcp_proxy needs to be killed to be stopped. Note
this will not usually kill any connections which have
already been accepted, and also that the port is not
immediately available for reuse.</p>

<p>The following chunk of code puts a list of sessions into
an xterm header, with the current session followed by a
star.</p>

<p>print -n 033]2;TCP:&quot;
${(k)tcp_by_name:/$TCP_SESS/$TCP_SES*} a&quot;</p>

<p>TCP BUGS The function tcp_read uses the shell s normal
read builtin. As this reads a complete line at once, data
arriving without a terminating new- line can cause the
function to block indefinitely.</p>

<p>Though the function suite works well for interactive use
and for data arriving in small amounts, the performance when
large amounts of data ZSHZFTPSYS(1) ZSHZFTPSYS(1)</p>

<p>are being exchanged is likely to be extremely poor.</p>

<p>NAME zshzftpsys - zftp function front-end</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This describes the set of shell functions
supplied with the source dis- tribution as an interface to
the zftp builtin command, allowing you to perform FTP
operations from the shell command line or within functions
or scripts. The interface is similar to a traditional FTP
client (e.g. the ftp command itself, see ftp(1)), but as it
is entirely done within the shell all the familiar
completion, editing and globbing features, and so on, are
present, and macros are particularly simple to write as they
are just ordinary shell functions.</p>

<p>The prerequisite is that the zftp command, as described
in zshmod- ules(1) , must be available in the version of zsh
installed at your site. If the shell is configured to load
new commands at run time, it probably is: typing zmodload
zsh/zftp will make sure (if that runs silently, it has
worked). If this is not the case, it is possible zftp was
linked into the shell anyway: to test this, type which zftp
and if zftp is available you will get the message zftp:
shell built-in command.</p>

<p>Commands given directly with zftp builtin may be
interspersed between the functions in this suite; in a few
cases, using zftp directly may cause some of the status
information stored in shell parameters to become invalid.
Note in particular the description of the variables
$ZFTP_TMOUT, $ZFTP_PREFS and $ZFTP_VERBOSE for zftp.</p>

<p>INSTALLATION You should make sure all the functions from
the Functions/Zftp direc- tory of the source distribution
are available; they all begin with the two letters zf. They
may already have been installed on your system; otherwise,
you will need to find them and copy them. The directory
should appear as one of the elements of the $fpath array
(this should already be the case if they were installed),
and at least the function zfinit should be autoloaded; it
will autoload the rest. Finally, to initialize the use of
the system you need to call the zfinit function. The
following code in your .zshrc will arrange for this; assume
the functions are stored in the directory ~/myfns:</p>

<p>fpath=(~/myfns $fpath) autoload -U zfinit zfinit</p>

<p>Note that zfinit assumes you are using the zmodload
method to load the zftp command. If it is already built into
the shell, change zfinit to zfinit -n. It is helpful (though
not essential) if the call to zfinit appears after any code
to initialize the new completion system, else unnecessary
compctl commands will be given.</p>

<p>FUNCTIONS The sequence of operations in performing a
file transfer is essentially the same as that in a standard
FTP client. Note that, due to a quirk of the shell s getopts
builtin, for those functions that handle options you must
use -- rather than - to ensure the remaining arguments are
treated literally (a single - is treated as an
argument).</p>

<p>Opening a connection zfparams [ host [ user [ password
... ] ] ] Set or show the parameters for a future zfopen
with no argu- ments. If no arguments are given, the current
parameters are displayed (the password will be shown as a
line of asterisks). If a host is given, and either the user
or password is not, they will be prompted for; also, any
parameter given as ? will be prompted for, and if the ? is
followed by a string, that will be used as the prompt. As
zfopen calls zfparams to store the parameters, this usually
need not be called directly.</p>

<p>A single argument - will delete the stored parameters.
This will also cause the memory of the last directory (and
so on) on the other host to be deleted.</p>

<p>zfopen [ -1 ] [ host [ user [ password [ account ] ] ] ]
If host is present, open a connection to that host under
user- name user with password password (and, on the rare
occasions when it is necessary, account account). If a
necessary parame- ter is missing or given as ? it will be
prompted for. If host is not present, use a previously
stored set of parameters.</p>

<p>If the command was successful, and the terminal is
compatible with xterm or is sun-cmd, a summary will appear
in the title bar, giving the local host:directory and the
remote host:direc- tory; this is handled by the function
zftp_chpwd, described below.</p>

<p>Normally, the host, user and password are internally
recorded for later re-opening, either by a zfopen with no
arguments, or automatically (see below). With the option -1,
no information is stored. Also, if an open command with
arguments failed, the parameters will not be retained (and
any previous parameters will also be deleted). A zfopen on
its own, or a zfopen -1, never alters the stored
parameters.</p>

<p>Both zfopen and zfanon (but not zfparams) understand
URLs of the form ftp://host/path... as meaning to connect to
the host, then change directory to path (which must be a
directory, not a file). The ftp:// can be omitted; the
trailing / is enough to trigger recognition of the path.
Note prefixes other than ftp: are not recognized, and that
all characters after the first slash beyond host are
significant in path.</p>

<p>zfanon [ -1 ] host Open a connection host for anonymous
FTP. The username used is anonymous. The password (which
will be reported the first time) is generated as user@host;
this is then stored in the shell parameter $EMAIL_ADDR which
can alternatively be set manu- ally to a suitable
string.</p>

<p>Directory management zfcd [ dir ] zfcd - zfcd old new
Change the current directory on the remote server: this is
implemented to have many of the features of the shell
builtin cd.</p>

<p>In the first form with dir present, change to the
directory dir. The command zfcd .. is treated specially, so
is guaranteed to work on non-UNIX servers (note this is
handled internally by zftp). If dir is omitted, has the
effect of zfcd ~ .</p>

<p>The second form changes to the directory previously
current.</p>

<p>The third form attempts to change the current directory
by replacing the first occurrence of the string old with the
string new in the current directory.</p>

<p>Note that in this command, and indeed anywhere a remote
filename is expected, the string which on the local host
corresponds to ~ is converted back to a ~ before being
passed to the remote machine. This is convenient because of
the way expansion is performed on the command line before
zfcd receives a string. For example, suppose the command is
zfcd ~/foo. The shell will expand this to a full path such
as zfcd /home/user2/pws/foo . At this stage, zfcd recognises
the ini- tial path as corresponding to ~ and will send the
directory to the remote host as ~/foo, so that the ~ will be
expanded by the server to the correct remote host directory.
Other named directories of the form ~name are not treated in
this fashion.</p>

<p>zfhere Change directory on the remote server to the one
corresponding to the current local directory, with special
handling of ~ as in zfcd. For example, if the current local
directory is ~/foo/bar, then zfhere performs the effect of
zfcd ~/foo/bar.</p>

<p>zfdir [ -rfd ] [ - ] [ dir-options ] [ dir ] Produce a
long directory listing. The arguments dir-options and dir
are passed directly to the server and their effect is imple-
mentation dependent, but specifying a particular remote
direc- tory dir is usually possible. The output is passed
through a pager given by the environment variable $PAGER, or
more if that is not set.</p>

<p>The directory is usually cached for re-use. In fact, two
caches are maintained. One is for use when there is no
dir-options or dir, i.e. a full listing of the current
remote directory; it is flushed when the current remote
directory changes. The other is kept for repeated use of
zfdir with the same arguments; for example, repeated use of
zfdir /pub/gnu will only require the directory to be
retrieved on the first call. Alternatively, this cache can
be re-viewed with the -r option. As relative directories
will confuse zfdir, the -f option can be used to force the
cache to be flushed before the directory is listed. The
option -d will delete both caches without showing a direc-
tory listing; it will also delete the cache of file names in
the current remote directory, if any.</p>

<p>zfls [ ls-options ] [ dir ] List files on the remote
server. With no arguments, this will produce a simple list
of file names for the current remote directory. Any
arguments are passed directly to the server. No pager and no
caching is used.</p>

<p>Status commands zftype [ type ] With no arguments, show
the type of data to be transferred, usu- ally ASCII or
binary. With an argument, change the type: the types A or
ASCII for ASCII data and B or BINARY, I or IMAGE for binary
data are understood case-insensitively.</p>

<p>zfstat [ -v ] Show the status of the current or last
connection, as well as the status of some of zftps status
variables. With the -v option, a more verbose listing is
produced by querying the server for its version of events,
too.</p>

<p>Retrieving files The commands for retrieving files all
take at least two options. -G suppresses remote filename
expansion which would otherwise be performed (see below for
a more detailed description of that). -t attempts to set the
modification time of the local file to that of the remote
file: this requires version 5 of perl, see the description
of the function zfrtime below for more information.</p>

<p>zfget [ -Gtc ] file1 ... Retrieve all the listed files
file1 ... one at a time from the remote server. If a file
contains a /, the full name is passed to the remote server,
but the file is stored locally under the name given by the
part after the final /. The option -c (cat) forces all files
to be sent as a single stream to standard output; in this
case the -t option has no effect.</p>

<p>zfuget [ -Gvst ] file1 ... As zfget, but only retrieve
files where the version on the remote server is newer (has a
later modification time), or where the local file does not
exist. If the remote file is older but the files have
different sizes, or if the sizes are the same but the remote
file is newer, the user will usually be queried. With the
option -s, the command runs silently and will always
retrieve the file in either of those two cases. With the
option -v, the command prints more information about the
files while it is working out whether or not to transfer
them.</p>

<p>zfcget [ -Gt ] file1 ... As zfget, but if any of the
local files exists, and is shorter than the corresponding
remote file, the command assumes that it is the result of a
partially completed transfer and attempts to transfer the
rest of the file. This is useful on a poor connection which
keeps failing.</p>

<p>Note that this requires a commonly implemented, but
non-stan- dard, version of the FTP protocol, so is not
guaranteed to work on all servers.</p>

<p>zfgcp [ -Gt ] remote-file local-file zfgcp [ -Gt ]
rfile1 ... ldir This retrieves files from the remote server
with arguments behaving similarly to the cp command.</p>

<p>In the first form, copy remote-file from the server to
the local file local-file.</p>

<p>In the second form, copy all the remote files rfile1 ...
into the local directory ldir retaining the same basenames.
This assumes UNIX directory semantics.</p>

<p>Sending files zfput [ -r ] file1 ... Send all the file1
... given separately to the remote server. If a filename
contains a /, the full filename is used locally to find the
file, but only the basename is used for the remote file
name.</p>

<p>With the option -r, if any of the files are directories
they are sent recursively with all their subdirectories,
including files beginning with . . This requires that the
remote machine understand UNIX file semantics, since / is
used as a directory separator.</p>

<p>zfuput [ -vs ] file1 ... As zfput, but only send files
which are newer than their local equivalents, or if the
remote file does not exist. The logic is the same as for
zfuget, but reversed between local and remote files.</p>

<p>zfcput file1 ... As zfput, but if any remote file
already exists and is shorter than the local equivalent,
assume it is the result of an incom- plete transfer and send
the rest of the file to append to the existing part. As the
FTP append command is part of the stan- dard set, this is in
principle more likely to work than zfcget.</p>

<p>zfpcp local-file remote-file zfpcp lfile1 ... rdir This
sends files to the remote server with arguments behaving
similarly to the cp command.</p>

<p>With two arguments, copy local-file to the server as
remote-file.</p>

<p>With more than two arguments, copy all the local files
lfile1 ... into the existing remote directory rdir retaining
the same basenames. This assumes UNIX directory
semantics.</p>

<p>A problem arises if you attempt to use zfpcp lfile1
rdir, i.e. the second form of copying but with two
arguments, as the com- mand has no simple way of knowing if
rdir corresponds to a directory or a filename. It attempts
to resolve this in various ways. First, if the rdir argument
is . or .. or ends in a slash, it is assumed to be a
directory. Secondly, if the opera- tion of copying to a
remote file in the first form failed, and the remote server
sends back the expected failure code 553 and a reply
including the string Is a directory, then zfpcp will retry
using the second form.</p>

<p>Closing the connection zfclose Close the connection.</p>

<p>Session management zfsession [ -lvod ] [ sessname ]
Allows you to manage multiple FTP sessions at once. By
default, connections take place in a session called default
; by giving the command zfsession sessname you can change to
a new or existing session with a name of your choice. The
new session remembers its own connection, as well as
associated shell param- eters, and also the host/user
parameters set by zfparams. Hence you can have different
sessions set up to connect to different hosts, each
remembering the appropriate host, user and password.</p>

<p>With no arguments, zfsession prints the name of the
current ses- sion; with the option -l it lists all sessions
which currently exist, and with the option -v it gives a
verbose list showing the host and directory for each
session, where the current ses- sion is marked with an
asterisk. With -o, it will switch to the most recent
previous session.</p>

<p>With -d, the given session (or else the current one) is
removed; everything to do with it is completely forgotten.
If it was the only session, a new session called default is
created and made current. It is safest not to delete
sessions while background commands using zftp are
active.</p>

<p>zftransfer sess1:file1 sess2:file2 Transfer files
between two sessions; no local copy is made. The file is
read from the session sess1 as file1 and written to ses-
sion sess2 as file file2; file1 and file2 may be relative to
the current directories of the session. Either sess1 or
sess2 may be omitted (though the colon should be retained if
there is a possibility of a colon appearing in the file
name) and defaults to the current session; file2 may be
omitted or may end with a slash, in which case the basename
of file1 will be added. The sessions sess1 and sess2 must be
distinct.</p>

<p>The operation is performed using pipes, so it is
required that the connections still be valid in a subshell,
which is not the case under versions of some operating
systems, presumably due to a system bug.</p>

<p>Bookmarks The two functions zfmark and zfgoto allow you
to bookmark the present location (host, user and directory)
of the current FTP connection for later use. The file to be
used for storing and retrieving bookmarks is given by the
parameter $ZFTP_BMFILE; if not set when one of the two
functions is called, it will be set to the file .zfbkmarks
in the directory where your zsh startup files live (usually
~).</p>

<p>zfmark [ bookmark ] If given an argument, mark the
current host, user and directory under the name bookmark for
later use by zfgoto. If there is no connection open, use the
values for the last connection immedi- ately before it was
closed; it is an error if there was none. Any existing
bookmark under the same name will be silently replaced.</p>

<p>If not given an argument, list the existing bookmarks
and the points to which they refer in the form
user@host:directory; this is the format in which they are
stored, and the file may be edited directly.</p>

<p>zfgoto [ -n ] bookmark Return to the location given by
bookmark, as previously set by zfmark. If the location has
user ftp or anonymous, open the connection with zfanon, so
that no password is required. If the user and host
parameters match those stored for the current ses- sion, if
any, those will be used, and again no password is required.
Otherwise a password will be prompted for.</p>

<p>With the option -n, the bookmark is taken to be a
nickname stored by the ncftp program in its bookmark file,
which is assumed to be ~/.ncftp/bookmarks. The function
works identi- cally in other ways. Note that there is no
mechanism for adding or modifying ncftp bookmarks from the
zftp functions.</p>

<p>Other functions Mostly, these functions will not be
called directly (apart from zfinit), but are described here
for completeness. You may wish to alter zftp_chpwd and
zftp_progress, in particular.</p>

<p>zfinit [ -n ] As described above, this is used to
initialize the zftp function system. The -n option should be
used if the zftp command is already built into the
shell.</p>

<p>zfautocheck [ -dn ] This function is called to implement
automatic reopening behaviour, as described in more detail
below. The options must appear in the first argument; -n
prevents the command from changing to the old directory,
while -d prevents it from setting the variable do_close,
which it otherwise does as a flag for automatically closing
the connection after a transfer. The host and directory for
the last session are stored in the variable $zflastsession,
but the internal host/user/password parameters must also be
correctly set.</p>

<p>zfcd_match prefix suffix This performs matching for
completion of remote directory names. If the remote server
is UNIX, it will attempt to persuade the server to list the
remote directory with subdirectories marked, which usually
works but is not guaranteed. On other hosts it simply calls
zfget_match and hence completes all files, not just
directories. On some systems, directories may not even look
like filenames.</p>

<p>zfget_match prefix suffix This performs matching for
completion of remote filenames. It caches files for the
current directory (only) in the shell parameter
$zftp_fcache. It is in the form to be called by the -K
option of compctl, but also works when called from a wid-
get-style completion function with prefix and suffix set
appro- priately.</p>

<p>zfrglob varname Perform remote globbing, as describes in
more detail below. varname is the name of a variable
containing the pattern to be expanded; if there were any
matches, the same variable will be set to the expanded set
of filenames on return.</p>

<p>zfrtime lfile rfile [ time ] Set the local file lfile to
have the same modification time as the remote file rfile, or
the explicit time time in FTP format CCYYMMDDhhmmSS for the
GMT timezone.</p>

<p>Currently this requires perl version 5 to perform the
conversion from GMT to local time. This is unfortunately
difficult to do using shell code alone.</p>

<p>zftp_chpwd This function is called every time a
connection is opened, or closed, or the remote directory
changes. This version alters the title bar of an
xterm-compatible or sun-cmd terminal emula- tor to reflect
the local and remote hostnames and current direc- tories. It
works best when combined with the function chpwd. In
particular, a function of the form</p>

<p>chpwd() { if [[ -n $ZFTP_USER ]]; then zftp_chpwd else #
usual chpwd e.g put host:directory in title bar fi }</p>

<p>fits in well.</p>

<p>zftp_progress This function shows the status of the
transfer. It will not write anything unless the output is
going to a terminal; how- ever, if you transfer files in the
background, you should turn off progress reports by hand
using zstyle :zftp:* progress none . Note also that if you
alter it, any output must be to standard error, as standard
output may be a file being received. The form of the
progress meter, or whether it is used at all, can be
configured without altering the function, as described in
the next section.</p>

<p>zffcache This is used to implement caching of files in
the current direc- tory for each session separately. It is
used by zfget_match and zfrglob.</p>

<p>MISCELLANEOUS FEATURES Configuration Various styles are
available using the standard shell style mechanism,
described in zshmodules(1). Briefly, the command zstyle
:zftp:* style value .... defines the style to have value
value; more than one value may be given, although that is
not useful in the cases described here. These values will
then be used throughout the zftp function sys- tem. For more
precise control, the first argument, which gives a con- text
in which the style applies, can be modified to include a
particu- lar function, as for example :zftp:zfget: the style
will then have the given value only in the zfget function.
Values for the same style in different contexts may be set;
the most specific function will be used, where strings are
held to be more specific than patterns, and longer patterns
and shorter patterns. Note that only the top level function
name, as called by the user, is used; calling of lower level
functions is transparent to the user. Hence modifications to
the title bar in zftp_chpwd use the contexts :zftp:zfopen,
:zftp:zfcd, etc., depending where it was called from. The
following styles are under- stood:</p>

<p>progress Controls the way that zftp_progress reports on
the progress of a transfer. If empty, unset, or none, no
progress report is made; if bar a growing bar of inverse
video is shown; if per- cent (or any other string, though
this may change in future), the percentage of the file
transferred is shown. The bar meter requires that the width
of the terminal be available via the $COLUMNS parameter
(normally this is set automatically). If the size of the
file being transferred is not available, bar and percent
meters will simply show the number of bytes transferred so
far.</p>

<p>When zfinit is run, if this style is not defined for the
context :zftp:*, it will be set to bar.</p>

<p>update Specifies the minimum time interval between
updates of the progress meter in seconds. No update is made
unless new data has been received, so the actual time
interval is limited only by $ZFTP_TIMEOUT.</p>

<p>As described for progress, zfinit will force this to
default to 1.</p>

<p>remote-glob If set to 1, yes or true, filename
generation (globbing) is performed on the remote machine
instead of by zsh itself; see below.</p>

<p>titlebar If set to 1, yes or true, zftp_chpwd will put
the remote host and remote directory into the titlebar of
terminal emula- tors such as xterm or sun-cmd that allow
this.</p>

<p>As described for progress, zfinit will force this to
default to 1.</p>

<p>chpwd If set to 1 yes or true, zftp_chpwd will call the
function chpwd when a connection is closed. This is useful
if the remote host details were put into the terminal title
bar by zftp_chpwd and your usual chpwd also modifies the
title bar.</p>

<p>When zfinit is run, it will determine whether chpwd
exists and if so it will set the default value for the style
to 1 if none exists already.</p>

<p>Note that there is also an associative array zfconfig
which contains values used by the function system. This
should not be modified or overwritten.</p>

<p>Remote globbing The commands for retrieving files
usually perform filename generation (globbing) on their
arguments; this can be turned off by passing the option -G
to each of the commands. Normally this operates by retriev-
ing a complete list of files for the directory in question,
then match- ing these locally against the pattern supplied.
This has the advantage that the full range of zsh patterns
(respecting the setting of the option EXTENDED_GLOB) can be
used. However, it means that the direc- tory part of a
filename will not be expanded and must be given exactly. If
the remote server does not support the UNIX directory
semantics, directory handling is problematic and it is
recommended that globbing only be used within the current
directory. The list of files in the current directory, if
retrieved, will be cached, so that subsequent globs in the
same directory without an intervening zfcd are much
faster.</p>

<p>If the remote-glob style (see above) is set, globbing is
instead per- formed on the remote host: the server is asked
for a list of matching files. This is highly dependent on
how the server is implemented, though typically UNIX servers
will provide support for basic glob pat- terns. This may in
some cases be faster, as it avoids retrieving the entire
list of directory contents.</p>

<p>Automatic and temporary reopening As described for the
zfopen command, a subsequent zfopen with no param- eters
will reopen the connection to the last host (this includes
con- nections made with the zfanon command). Opened in this
fashion, the connection starts in the default remote
directory and will remain open until explicitly closed.</p>

<p>Automatic re-opening is also available. If a connection
is not cur- rently open and a command requiring a connection
is given, the last connection is implicitly reopened. In
this case the directory which was current when the
connection was closed again becomes the current directory
(unless, of course, the command given changes it). Automatic
reopening will also take place if the connection was close
by the remote server for whatever reason (e.g. a timeout).
It is not avail- able if the -1 option to zfopen or zfanon
was used.</p>

<p>Furthermore, if the command issued is a file transfer,
the connection will be closed after the transfer is
finished, hence providing a one-shot mode for transfers.
This does not apply to directory changing or listing
commands; for example a zfdir may reopen a connection but
will leave it open. Also, automatic closure will only ever
happen in the same command as automatic opening, i.e a zfdir
directly followed by a zfget will never close the connection
automatically.</p>

<p>Information about the previous connection is given by
the zfstat func- tion. So, for example, if that reports:</p>

<p>Session: default Not connected. Last session:
ftp.bar.com:/pub/textfiles</p>

<p>then the command zfget file.txt will attempt to reopen a
connection to ftp.bar.com, retrieve the file
/pub/textfiles/file.txt, and immediately close the
connection again. On the other hand, zfcd .. will open the
connection in the directory /pub and leave it open.</p>

<p>Note that all the above is local to each session; if you
return to a previous session, the connection for that
session is the one which will be reopened.</p>

<p>Completion Completion of local and remote files,
directories, sessions and book- marks is supported. The
older, compctl-style completion is defined when zfinit is
called; support for the new widget-based completion sys- tem
is provided in the function Completion/Zsh/Command/_zftp,
which should be installed with the other functions of the
completion system ZSHCONTRIB(1) ZSHCONTRIB(1)</p>

<p>and hence should automatically be available.</p>

<p>NAME zshcontrib - user contributions to zsh</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The Zsh source distribution includes a
number of items contributed by the user community. These are
not inherently a part of the shell, and some may not be
available in every zsh installation. The most signifi- cant
of these are documented here. For documentation on other
con- tributed items such as shell functions, look for
comments in the func- tion source files.</p>

<p>UTILITIES Accessing On-Line Help The key sequence ESC h
is normally bound by ZLE to execute the run-help widget (see
zshzle(1)). This invokes the run-help command with the
command word from the current input line as its argument. By
default, run-help is an alias for the man command, so this
often fails when the command word is a shell builtin or a
user-defined function. By redefining the run-help alias, one
can improve the on-line help pro- vided by the shell.</p>

<p>The helpfiles utility, found in the Util directory of
the distribution, is a Perl program that can be used to
process the zsh manual to produce a separate help file for
each shell builtin and for many other shell features as
well. The autoloadable run-help function, found in Func-
tions/Misc, searches for these helpfiles and performs
several other tests to produce the most complete help
possible for the command.</p>

<p>There may already be a directory of help files on your
system; look in /usr/share/zsh or /usr/local/share/zsh and
subdirectories below those, or ask your system
administrator.</p>

<p>To create your own help files with helpfiles, choose or
create a direc- tory where the individual command help files
will reside. For example, you might choose ~/zsh_help. If
you unpacked the zsh distribution in your home directory,
you would use the commands:</p>

<p>mkdir ~/zsh_help cd ~/zsh_help man zshall | colcrt - |
perl ~/zsh-4.3.10/Util/helpfiles</p>

<p>Next, to use the run-help function, you need to add
lines something like the following to your .zshrc or
equivalent startup file:</p>

<p>unalias run-help autoload run-help
HELPDIR=~/zsh_help</p>

<p>The HELPDIR parameter tells run-help where to look for
the help files. If your system already has a help file
directory installed, set HELPDIR to the path of that
directory instead.</p>

<p>Note that in order for autoload run-help to work, the
run-help file must be in one of the directories named in
your fpath array (see zsh- param(1)). This should already be
the case if you have a standard zsh installation; if it is
not, copy Functions/Misc/run-help to an appro- priate
directory.</p>

<p>Recompiling Functions If you frequently edit your zsh
functions, or periodically update your zsh installation to
track the latest developments, you may find that function
digests compiled with the zcompile builtin are frequently
out of date with respect to the function source files. This
is not usually a problem, because zsh always looks for the
newest file when loading a function, but it may cause slower
shell startup and function loading. Also, if a digest file
is explicitly used as an element of fpath, zsh wont check
whether any of its source files has changed.</p>

<p>The zrecompile autoloadable function, found in
Functions/Misc, can be used to keep function digests up to
date.</p>

<p>zrecompile [ -qt ] [ name ... ] zrecompile [ -qt ] -p
args [ -- args ... ] This tries to find *.zwc files and
automatically re-compile them if at least one of the
original files is newer than the compiled file. This works
only if the names stored in the compiled files are full
paths or are relative to the directory that contains the
.zwc file.</p>

<p>In the first form, each name is the name of a compiled
file or a directory containing *.zwc files that should be
checked. If no arguments are given, the directories and
*.zwc files in fpath are used.</p>

<p>When -t is given, no compilation is performed, but a
return sta- tus of zero (true) is set if there are files
that need to be re-compiled and non-zero (false) otherwise.
The -q option qui- ets the chatty output that describes what
zrecompile is doing.</p>

<p>Without the -t option, the return status is zero if all
files that needed re-compilation could be compiled and
non-zero if compilation for at least one of the files
failed.</p>

<p>If the -p option is given, the args are interpreted as
one or more sets of arguments for zcompile, separated by --.
For example:</p>

<p>zrecompile -p -R ~/.zshrc -- -M ~/.zcompdump --
~/zsh/comp.zwc ~/zsh/Completion/*/_*</p>

<p>This compiles ~/.zshrc into ~/.zshrc.zwc if that doesnt
exist or if it is older than ~/.zshrc. The compiled file
will be marked for reading instead of mapping. The same is
done for ~/.zcompdump and ~/.zcompdump.zwc, but this
compiled file is marked for mapping. The last line
re-creates the file ~/zsh/comp.zwc if any of the files
matching the given pattern is newer than it.</p>

<p>Without the -p option, zrecompile does not create
function digests that do not already exist, nor does it add
new functions to the digest.</p>

<p>The following shell loop is an example of a method for
creating func- tion digests for all functions in your fpath,
assuming that you have write permission to the
directories:</p>

<p>for ((i=1; i &lt;= $#fpath; ++i)); do dir=$fpath[i]
zwc=${dir:t}.zwc if [[ $dir == (.|..) || $dir == (.|..)/*
]]; then continue fi files=($dir/*(N-.)) if [[ -w $dir:h
&amp;&amp; -n $files ]]; then files=(${${(M)files%/*/*}#/})
if ( cd $dir:h &amp;&amp; zrecompile -p -U -z $zwc $files );
then fpath[i]=$fpath[i].zwc fi fi done</p>

<p>The -U and -z options are appropriate for functions in
the default zsh installation fpath; you may need to use
different options for your per- sonal function
directories.</p>

<p>Once the digests have been created and your fpath
modified to refer to them, you can keep them up to date by
running zrecompile with no argu- ments.</p>

<p>Keyboard Definition The large number of possible
combinations of keyboards, workstations, terminals,
emulators, and window systems makes it impossible for zsh to
have built-in key bindings for every situation. The zkbd
utility, found in Functions/Misc, can help you quickly
create key bindings for your configuration.</p>

<p>Run zkbd either as an autoloaded function, or as a shell
script:</p>

<p>zsh -f ~/zsh-4.3.10/Functions/Misc/zkbd</p>

<p>When you run zkbd, it first asks you to enter your
terminal type; if the default it offers is correct, just
press return. It then asks you to press a number of
different keys to determine characteristics of your keyboard
and terminal; zkbd warns you if it finds anything out of the
ordinary, such as a Delete key that sends neither ^H nor
^?.</p>

<p>The keystrokes read by zkbd are recorded as a definition
for an asso- ciative array named key, written to a file in
the subdirectory .zkbd within either your HOME or ZDOTDIR
directory. The name of the file is composed from the TERM,
VENDOR and OSTYPE parameters, joined by hyphens.</p>

<p>You may read this file into your .zshrc or another
startup file with the source or . commands, then reference
the key parameter in bind- key commands, like this:</p>

<p>source ${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}/.zkbd/$TERM-$VENDOR-$OSTYPE [[
-n ${key[Left]} ]] &amp;&amp; bindkey
&quot;${key[Left]}&quot; backward-char [[ -n ${key[Right]}
]] &amp;&amp; bindkey &quot;${key[Right]}&quot; forward-char
# etc.</p>

<p>Note that in order for autoload zkbd to work, the zkdb
file must be in one of the directories named in your fpath
array (see zshparam(1)). This should already be the case if
you have a standard zsh installa- tion; if it is not, copy
Functions/Misc/zkbd to an appropriate direc- tory.</p>

<p>Dumping Shell State Occasionally you may encounter what
appears to be a bug in the shell, particularly if you are
using a beta version of zsh or a development release.
Usually it is sufficient to send a description of the
problem to one of the zsh mailing lists (see zsh(1)), but
sometimes one of the zsh developers will need to recreate
your environment in order to track the problem down.</p>

<p>The script named reporter, found in the Util directory
of the distribu- tion, is provided for this purpose. (It is
also possible to autoload reporter, but reporter is not
installed in fpath by default.) This script outputs a
detailed dump of the shell state, in the form of another
script that can be read with zsh -f to recreate that
state.</p>

<p>To use reporter, read the script into your shell with
the . command and redirect the output into a file:</p>

<p>. ~/zsh-4.3.10/Util/reporter &gt; zsh.report</p>

<p>You should check the zsh.report file for any sensitive
information such as passwords and delete them by hand before
sending the script to the developers. Also, as the output
can be voluminous, its best to wait for the developers to
ask for this information before sending it.</p>

<p>You can also use reporter to dump only a subset of the
shell state. This is sometimes useful for creating startup
files for the first time. Most of the output from reporter
is far more detailed than usually is necessary for a startup
file, but the aliases, options, and zstyles states may be
useful because they include only changes from the defaults.
The bindings state may be useful if you have created any of
your own keymaps, because reporter arranges to dump the
keymap creation commands as well as the bindings for every
keymap.</p>

<p>As is usual with automated tools, if you create a
startup file with reporter, you should edit the results to
remove unnecessary commands. Note that if youre using the
new completion system, you should not dump the functions
state to your startup files with reporter; use the compdump
function instead (see zshcompsys(1)).</p>

<p>reporter [ state ... ] Print to standard output the
indicated subset of the current shell state. The state
arguments may be one or more of:</p>

<p>all Output everything listed below. aliases Output alias
definitions. bindings Output ZLE key maps and bindings.
completion Output old-style compctl commands. New completion
is covered by functions and zstyles. functions Output
autoloads and function definitions. limits Output limit
commands. options Output setopt commands. styles Same as
zstyles. variables Output shell parameter assignments, plus
export commands for any environment variables. zstyles
Output zstyle commands.</p>

<p>If the state is omitted, all is assumed.</p>

<p>With the exception of all, every state can be
abbreviated by any pre- fix, even a single letter; thus a is
the same as aliases, z is the same as zstyles, etc.</p>

<p>Manipulating Hook Functions add-zsh-hook [-dD] hook
function Several functions are special to the shell, as
described in the section SPECIAL FUNCTIONS, see zshmisc(1),
in that they are automatic called at a specific point during
shell execution. Each has an associated array consisting of
names of functions to be called at the same point; these are
so-called hook func- tions . The shell function add-zsh-hook
provides a simple way of adding or removing functions from
the array.</p>

<p>hook is one of chpwd, periodic, precmd or preexec, the
special functions in question.</p>

<p>functions is name of an ordinary shell function. If no
options are given this will be added to the array of
functions to be executed. in the given context.</p>

<p>If the option -d is given, the function is removed from
the array of functions to be executed.</p>

<p>If the option -D is given, the function is treated as a
pattern and any matching names of functions are removed from
the array of functions to be executed.</p>

<p>GATHERING INFORMATION FROM VERSION CONTROL SYSTEMS In a
lot of cases, it is nice to automatically retrieve
information from version control systems (VCSs), such as
subversion, CVS or git, to be able to provide it to the
user; possibly in the user s prompt. So that you can
instantly tell on which branch you are currently on, for
example.</p>

<p>In order to do that, you may use the vcs_info
function.</p>

<p>The following VCSs are supported, showing the
abbreviated name by which they are referred to within the
system: Bazaar (bzr) http://bazaar-vcs.org/ Codeville (cdv)
http://codeville.org/ Concurrent Versioning System (cvs)
http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/ darcs http://darcs.net/ git
http://git.or.cz/ GNU arch (tla)
http://www.gnu.org/software/gnu-arch/ Mercurial (hg)
http://selenic.com/mercurial/ Monotone (mtn)
http://monotone.ca/ Perforce (p4) http://www.perforce.com/
Subversion (svn) http://subversion.tigris.org/ SVK (svk)
http://svk.bestpractical.com/</p>

<p>To load vcs_info:</p>

<p>autoload -Uz vcs_info</p>

<p>It can be used in any existing prompt, because it does
not require any $psvar entries to be left available.</p>

<p>Quickstart To get this feature working quickly
(including colors), you can do the following (assuming, you
loaded vcs_info properly - see above):</p>

<p>zstyle:vcs_info:* actionformats
%F{5}(%f%s%F{5})%F{3}-%F{5}[%F{2}%b%F{3}|%F{1}%a%F{5}]%f
zstyle :vcs_info:* formats
%F{5}(%f%s%F{5})%F{3}-%F{5}[%F{2}%b%F{5}]%f zstyle
:vcs_info:(sv[nk]|bzr):* branchformat %b%F{1}:%F{3}%r precmd
() { vcs_info } PS1= %F{5}[%F{2}%n%F{5}] %F{3}%3~
${vcs_info_msg_0_}%f%#</p>

<p>Obviously, the last two lines are there for
demonstration: You need to call vcs_info from your precmd
function. Once that is done you need a single quoted
${vcs_info_msg_0_}_in your prompt.</p>

<p>To be able to use ${vcs_info_msg_0_}_directly in your
prompt like this, you will need to have the PROMPT_SUBST
option enabled.</p>

<p>Now call the vcs_info_printsys utility from the command
line:</p>

<p>% vcs_info_printsys ## list of supported version control
backends: ## disabled systems are prefixed by a hash sign
(#) bzr cdv cvs darcs git hg mtn p4 svk svn tla ## flavours
(cannot be used in the enable or disable styles; they ## are
enabled and disabled with their master [git-svn -&gt; git])
## they *can* be used contexts::vcs_info:git-svn:*. git-p4
git-svn</p>

<p>You may not want all of these because there is no point
in running the code to detect systems you do not use. So
there is a way to disable some backends altogether:</p>

<p>zstyle:vcs_info:*disable bzr cdv darcs mtn svk tla</p>

<p>You may also pick a few from that list and enable only
those:</p>

<p>zstyle:vcs_info:*enable git cvs svn</p>

<p>If you rerun vcs_info_printsys after one of these
commands, you will see the backends listed in the disable
style (or backends not in the enable style - if you used
that) marked as disabled by a hash sign. That means the
detection of these systems is skipped completely. No wasted
time there.</p>

<p>Configuration The vcs_info feature can be configured via
zstyle.</p>

<p>First, the context in which we are working:
:vcs_info:&lt;vcs-string&gt;:&lt;user-context&gt;:&lt;repo-root-name&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;vcs-string&gt; is one of: git, git-svn, git-p4, hg,
darcs, bzr, cdv, mtn, svn, cvs, svk, tla or p4.</p>

<p>&lt;user-context&gt; is a freely configurable string,
assignable by the user as the first argument to vcs_info
(see its description below).</p>

<p>&lt;repo-root-name&gt; is the name of a repository in
which you want a style to match. So, if you want a setting
specific to /usr/src/zsh, with that being a cvs checkout,
you can set &lt;repo-root-name&gt; to zsh to make it so.</p>

<p>There are three special values for &lt;vcs-string&gt;:
The first is named -init-, that is in effect as long as
there was no decision what vcs backend to use. The second is
-preinit-; it is used before vcs_info is run, when
initializing the data exporting variables. The third special
value is formats and is used by the vcs_info_lastmsg for
looking up its styles.</p>

<p>The initial value of &lt;repo-root-name&gt; is -all- and
it is replaced with the actual name, as soon as it is known.
Only use this part of the con- text for defining the
formats, actionformats or branchformat styles. As it is
guaranteed that &lt;repo-root-name&gt; is set up correctly
for these only. For all other styles, just use*instead.</p>

<p>There are two pre-defined values for
&lt;user-context&gt;: default the one used if none is
specified command used by vcs_info_lastmsg to lookup its
styles</p>

<p>You can of course use:vcs_info:*to match all VCSs in all
user-con- texts at once.</p>

<p>This is a description of all styles that are looked
up.</p>

<p>formats A list of formats, used when actionformats is
not used (which is most of the time).</p>

<p>actionformats A list of formats, used if a there is a
special action going on in your current repository; (like an
interactive rebase or a merge conflict).</p>

<p>branchformat Some backends replace %b in the formats and
actionformats styles above, not only by a branch name but
also by a revision number. This style lets you modify how
that string should look like.</p>

<p>nvcsformats These &quot;formats&quot; are exported, when
we didnt detect a version control system for the current
directory. This is useful, if you want vcs_info to
completely take over the generation of your prompt. You
would do something like PS1= ${vcs_info_msg_0_}to accomplish
that.</p>

<p>stgitformat The git backend replaces %m in the formats
and actionformats styles with stgit-specific information for
stgit-initialized branches. This style let s you modify how
that string should look like.</p>

<p>max-exports Defines the maximum number if
vcs_info_msg_*_ variables vcs_info will export.</p>

<p>enable A list of backends you want to use. Checked in
the -init- con- text. If this list contains an item called
NONE no backend is used at all and vcs_info will do nothing.
If this list contains ALL vcs_info will use all backends
known to it. Only with ALL in enable, the disable style has
any effect. ALL and NONE are actu- ally tested case
insensitively.</p>

<p>disable A list of VCSs, you dont want vcs_info to test
for repositories (checked in the -init- context, too). Only
used if enable con- tains ALL.</p>

<p>disable-patterns A list of patterns that are checked
against $PWD. If a pattern matches, vcs_info will be
disabled. This style is checked in the
:vcs_info:-init-:*:-all- context.</p>

<p>Say, ~/.zsh is a directory under version control, in
which you do not want vcs_info to be active, do: zstyle
:vcs_info:* disable-patterns &quot;$HOME/.zsh(|/*)&quot;</p>

<p>check-for-changes If enabled, this style (currently only
used by the git backend) causes the %c and %u format escapes
to be filled with informa- tion. The strings filled into
these escapes can be controlled via the stagedstr and
unstagedstr styles.</p>

<p>Note, that the actions taken if this style is enabled
are poten- tially expensive (read: they take time, depending
on how big the current repository is). Therefore, it is
disabled by default.</p>

<p>stagedstr This string will be used in the %c escape if
there are staged changes in the repository.</p>

<p>unstagedstr This string will be used in the %u escape if
there are unstaged changes in the repository.</p>

<p>command This style causes vcs_info to use the supplied
string as the command to use as the vcs s binary. Note, that
setting this in :vcs_info:* is not a good idea.</p>

<p>If the value of this style is empty (which is the
default), the used binary name is the name of the backend in
use (e.g. svn is used in a svn repository).</p>

<p>The repo-root-name part in the context is always the
default -all- when this style is looked up.</p>

<p>For example, this style can be used to use binaries from
non-default installation directories. Assume, git is
installed in /usr/bin, but your sysadmin installed a newer
version in /usr/bin/local. Now, instead of changing the
order of your $PATH parameter, you can do this: zstyle
:vcs_info:git:*:-all- command /usr/local/bin/git</p>

<p>use-server This is used by the Perforce backend (p4) to
decide if it should contact the Perforce server to find out
if a directory is man- aged by Perforce. This is the only
reliable way of doing this, but runs the risk of a delay if
the server name cannot be found. If the server (more
specifically, the host:port pair describing the server)
cannot be contacted its name is put into the asso- ciative
array vcs_info_p4_dead_servers and not contacted again
during the session until it is removed by hand. If you do
not set this style, the p4 backend is only usable if you
have set the environment variable P4CONFIG to a file name
and have corre- sponding files in the root directories of
each Perforce client. See comments in the function
VCS_INFO_detect_p4 for more detail.</p>

<p>use-simple If there are two different ways of gathering
information, you can select the simpler one by setting this
style to true; the default is to use the not-that-simple
code, which is potentially a lot slower but might be more
accurate in all possible cases. This style is only used by
the bzr backend.</p>

<p>get-revision If set to true, vcs_info goes the extra
mile to figure out the revision of a repositorys work tree
(currently for the git and hg backends, where this kind of
information is not always vital). For git, the hash value of
the currently checked out commit is available via the %i
expansion. With hg, the local revision number is available
via %i and the corresponding global hash is available via
%m. If this style is set in the hg con- text, the backend
supports the branchformat style.</p>

<p>use-prompt-escapes Determines if we assume that the
assembled string from vcs_info includes prompt escapes.
(Used by vcs_info_lastmsg.)</p>

<p>The default values for these styles in all contexts
are:</p>

<p>formats &quot; (%s)-[%b|%a]-&quot; actionformats &quot;
(%s)-[%b]-&quot; branchformat &quot;%b:%r&quot; (for bzr,
svn and svk) nvcsformats &quot;&quot; stgitformat &quot; %p
(%c)&quot; max-exports 2 enable ALL disable (empty list)
disable-patterns (empty list) check-for-changes false
stagedstr (string: &quot;S&quot;) unstagedstr (string:
&quot;U&quot;) command (empty string) use-server false
use-simple false get-revision false use-prompt-escapes
true</p>

<p>In normal formats and actionformats, the following
replacements are done:</p>

<p>%s The vcs in use (git, hg, svn etc.) %b Information
about the current branch. %a An identifier, that describes
the action. Only makes sense in actionformats. %i The
current revision number or identifier. %c The string from
the stagedstr style if there are staged changes in the
repository. %u The string from the unstagedstr style if
there are unstaged changes in the repository. %R base
directory of the repository. %r repository name. If %R is
/foo/bar/repoXY, %r is repoXY. %S subdirectory within a
repository. If $PWD is /foo/bar/reposXY/beer/tasty, %S is
beer/tasty. %m A &quot;misc&quot; replacement. It is at the
discretion of the backend to decide what this replacement
expands to. It is currently used by the hg and git backends.
The hg backend replaces %m with the global hash value of the
current revision and the git backend replaces it with the
string from the stgitformat style.</p>

<p>In branchformat these replacements are done:</p>

<p>%b the branch name %r the current revision number</p>

<p>In stgitformat these replacements are done:</p>

<p>%p the name of the patch currently on top of the stack
%c the number of unapplied patches</p>

<p>Not all vcs backends have to support all replacements.
For nvcsformats no replacements are performed at all. It is
just a string.</p>

<p>Oddities If you want to use the %b (bold off) prompt
expansion in formats, which expands %b itself, use %%b. That
will cause the vcs_info expansion to replace %%b with %b. So
zshs prompt expansion mechanism can handle it. Similarly, to
hand down %b from branchformat, use %%%%b. Sorry for this
inconvenience, but it cannot be easily avoided. Luckily we
do not clash with a lot of prompt expansions and this only
needs to be done for those.</p>

<p>Function descriptions (public API) vcs_info
[user-context] The main function, that runs all backends and
assembles all data into ${vcs_info_msg_*_}. This is the
function you want to call from precmd if you want to include
up-to-date information in your prompt (see Variable
description below). If an argument is given, that string
will be used instead of default in the user-context field of
the style context.</p>

<p>vcs_info_lastmsg Outputs the last ${vcs_info_msg_*_}
value. Takes into account the value of the
use-prompt-escapes style in _
:vcs_info:formats:command:-all-_. It also only prints
max-exports values.</p>

<p>vcs_info_printsys [user-context] Prints a list of all
supported version control systems. Useful to find out
possible contexts (and which of them are enabled) or values
for the disable style.</p>

<p>vcs_info_setsys Initializes vcs_infos internal list of
available backends. With this function, you can add support
for new VCSs without restart- ing the shell.</p>

<p>All functions named VCS_INFO_* are for internal use
only.</p>

<p>Variable description ${vcs_info_msg_N_} (Note the
trailing underscore) Where N is an integer, eg:
vcs_info_msg_0_ These variables are the storage for the
informational message the last vcs_info call has assembled.
These are strongly connected to the formats, actionformats
and nvcsformats styles described above. Those styles are
lists. The first member of that list gets expanded into
${vcs_info_msg_0_}, the second into ${vcs_info_msg_1_} and
the Nth into ${vcs_info_msg_N-1_}. These parameters are
exported into the environment. (See the max-exports style
above.)</p>

<p>All variables named VCS_INFO_* are for internal use
only.</p>

<p>Examples Dont use vcs_info at all (even though its in
your prompt): zstyle:vcs_info:*enable NONE</p>

<p>Disable the backends for bzr and svk:
zstyle:vcs_info:*disable bzr svk</p>

<p>Disable everything but bzr and svk:
zstyle:vcs_info:*enable bzr svk</p>

<p>Provide a special formats for git:
zstyle:vcs_info:git:*formats GIT, BABY! [%b] zstyle
:vcs_info:git:* actionformats GIT ACTION! [%b|%a]</p>

<p>Use the quicker bzr backend
zstyle:vcs_info:bzr:*use-simple true</p>

<p>If you do use use-simple, please report if it does
the-right-thing[tm].</p>

<p>Display the revision number in yellow for bzr and svn:
zstyle :vcs_info:(svn|bzr):* branchformat %b%{
${fg[yellow]%}:%r</p>

<p>If you want colors, make sure you enclose the color
codes in %{...%}, if you want to use the string provided by
vcs_info in prompts.</p>

<p>Here is how to print the vcs information as a command
(not in a prompt): alias vcsivcs_info command;
vcs_info_lastmsg</p>

<p>This way, you can even define different formats for
output via vcs_info_lastmsg in the
:vcs_info:formats:command:* namespace.</p>

<p>PROMPT THEMES Installation You should make sure all the
functions from the Functions/Prompts directory of the source
distribution are available; they all begin with the string
prompt_ except for the special function promptinit. You also
need the colors function from Functions/Misc. All of these
functions may already have been installed on your system; if
not, you will need to find them and copy them. The directory
should appear as one of the elements of the fpath array
(this should already be the case if they were installed),
and at least the function promptinit should be autoloaded;
it will autoload the rest. Finally, to initialize the use of
the system you need to call the promptinit function. The
following code in your .zshrc will arrange for this; assume
the functions are stored in the directory ~/myfns:</p>

<p>fpath=(~/myfns $fpath) autoload -U promptinit
promptinit</p>

<p>Theme Selection Use the prompt command to select your
preferred theme. This command may be added to your .zshrc
following the call to promptinit in order to start zsh with
a theme already selected.</p>

<p>prompt [ -c | -l ] prompt [ -p | -h ] [ theme ... ]
prompt [ -s ] theme [ arg ... ] Set or examine the prompt
theme. With no options and a theme argument, the theme with
that name is set as the current theme. The available themes
are determined at run time; use the -l option to see a list.
The special theme random selects at random one of the
available themes and sets your prompt to that.</p>

<p>In some cases the theme may be modified by one or more
argu- ments, which should be given after the theme name. See
the help for each theme for descriptions of these
arguments.</p>

<p>Options are:</p>

<p>-c Show the currently selected theme and its parameters,
if any. -l List all available prompt themes. -p Preview the
theme named by theme, or all themes if no theme is given. -h
Show help for the theme named by theme, or for the prompt
function if no theme is given. -s Set theme as the current
theme and save state.</p>

<p>prompt_theme_setup Each available theme has a setup
function which is called by the prompt function to install
that theme. This function may define other functions as
necessary to maintain the prompt, including functions used
to preview the prompt or provide help for its use. You
should not normally call a theme s setup function
directly.</p>

<p>ZLE FUNCTIONS Widgets These functions all implement
user-defined ZLE widgets (see zshzle(1)) which can be bound
to keystrokes in interactive shells. To use them, your
.zshrc should contain lines of the form</p>

<p>autoload function zle -N function</p>

<p>followed by an appropriate bindkey command to associate
the function with a key sequence. Suggested bindings are
described below.</p>

<p>bash-style word functions If you are looking for
functions to implement moving over and editing words in the
manner of bash, where only alphanumeric characters are
considered word characters, you can use the func- tions
described in the next section. The following is suffi-
cient:</p>

<p>autoload -U select-word-style select-word-style bash</p>

<p>forward-word-match, backward-word-match kill-word-match,
backward-kill-word-match transpose-words-match,
capitalize-word-match up-case-word-match,
down-case-word-match select-word-style, match-word-context,
match-words-by-style The eight -match functions are drop-in
replacements for the builtin widgets without the suffix. By
default they behave in a similar way. However, by the use of
styles and the function select-word-style, the way words are
matched can be altered.</p>

<p>The simplest way of configuring the functions is to use
select-word-style, which can either be called as a normal
func- tion with the appropriate argument, or invoked as a
user-defined widget that will prompt for the first character
of the word style to be used. The first time it is invoked,
the eight -match functions will automatically replace the
builtin ver- sions, so they do not need to be loaded
explicitly.</p>

<p>The word styles available are as follows. Only the first
char- acter is examined.</p>

<p>bash Word characters are alphanumeric characters
only.</p>

<p>normal As in normal shell operation: word characters are
alphanumeric characters plus any characters present in the
string given by the parameter $WORDCHARS.</p>

<p>shell Words are complete shell command arguments,
possibly including complete quoted strings, or any tokens
special to the shell.</p>

<p>whitespace Words are any set of characters delimited by
whitespace.</p>

<p>default Restore the default settings; this is usually
the same as normal.</p>

<p>All but default can be input as an upper case character,
which has the same effect but with subword matching turned
on. In this case, words with upper case characters are
treated spe- cially: each separate run of upper case
characters, or an upper case character followed by any
number of other characters, is considered a word. The style
subword-range can supply an alter- native character range to
the default [:upper:] ; the value of the style is treated as
the contents of a [...] pattern (note that the outer
brackets should not be supplied, only those sur- rounding
named ranges).</p>

<p>More control can be obtained using the zstyle command,
as described in zshmodules(1). Each style is looked up in
the con- text :zle:widget where widget is the name of the
user-defined widget, not the name of the function
implementing it, so in the case of the definitions supplied
by select-word-style the appro- priate contexts are
:zle:forward-word, and so on. The function select-word-style
itself always defines styles for the context :zle:* which
can be overridden by more specific (longer) pat- terns as
well as explicit contexts.</p>

<p>The style word-style specifies the rules to use. This
may have the following values.</p>

<p>normal Use the standard shell rules, i.e. alphanumerics
and $WORDCHARS, unless overridden by the styles word-chars
or word-class.</p>

<p>specified Similar to normal, but only the specified
characters, and not also alphanumerics, are considered word
characters.</p>

<p>unspecified The negation of specified. The given
characters are those which will not be considered part of a
word.</p>

<p>shell Words are obtained by using the syntactic rules
for gen- erating shell command arguments. In addition,
special tokens which are never command arguments such as ()
are also treated as words.</p>

<p>whitespace Words are whitespace-delimited strings of
characters.</p>

<p>The first three of those rules usually use $WORDCHARS,
but the value in the parameter can be overridden by the
style word-chars, which works in exactly the same way as
$WORDCHARS. In addition, the style word-class uses character
class syntax to group characters and takes precedence over
word-chars if both are set. The word-class style does not
include the surrounding brackets of the character class; for
example, -:[:alnum:] is a valid word-class to include all
alphanumerics plus the charac- ters - and :. Be careful
including ], ^ and - as these are special inside character
classes.</p>

<p>word-style may also have -subword appended to its value
to turn on subword matching, as described above.</p>

<p>The style skip-chars is mostly useful for
transpose-words and similar functions. If set, it gives a
count of characters starting at the cursor position which
will not be considered part of the word and are treated as
space, regardless of what they actually are. For example,
if</p>

<p>zstyle:zle:transpose-wordsskip-chars 1</p>

<p>has been set, and transpose-words-match is called with
the cur- sor on the X of fooXbar, where X can be any
character, then the resulting expression is barXfoo.</p>

<p>Finer grained control can be obtained by setting the
style word-context to an array of pairs of entries. Each
pair of entries consists of a pattern and a subcontext. The
shell argu- ment the cursor is on is matched against each
pattern in turn until one matches; if it does, the context
is extended by a colon and the corresponding subcontext.
Note that the test is made against the original word on the
line, with no stripping of quotes. Special handling is done
between words: the current context is examined and if it
contains the string back, the word before the cursor is
considered, else the word after cursor is considered. Some
examples are given below.</p>

<p>Here are some examples of use of the styles, actually
taken from the simplified interface in
select-word-style:</p>

<p>zstyle:zle:*word-style standard
zstyle:zle:*word-chars</p>

<p>Implements bash-style word handling for all widgets,
i.e. only alphanumerics are word characters; equivalent to
setting the parameter WORDCHARS empty for the given
context.</p>

<p>style:zle:*kill*word-style space</p>

<p>Uses space-delimited words for widgets with the word
kill in the name. Neither of the styles word-chars nor
word-class is used in this case.</p>

<p>Here are some examples of use of the word-context style
to extend the context.</p>

<p>zstyle :zle:* word-context &quot;*/*&quot; file
&quot;[[:space:]]&quot; whitespace zstyle
:zle:transpose-words:whitespace word-style shell zstyle
:zle:transpose-words:filename word-style normal zstyle
:zle:transpose-words:filename word-chars</p>

<p>This provides two different ways of using
transpose-words depending on whether the cursor is on
whitespace between words or on a filename, here any word
containing a /. On whitespace, complete arguments as defined
by standard shell rules will be transposed. In a filename,
only alphanumerics will be trans- posed. Elsewhere, words
will be transposed using the default style for
:zle:transpose-words.</p>

<p>The word matching and all the handling of zstyle
settings is actually implemented by the function
match-words-by-style. This can be used to create new
user-defined widgets. The calling function should set the
local parameter curcontext to :zle:wid- get, create the
local parameter matched_words and call match-words-by-style
with no arguments. On return, matched_words will be set to
an array with the elements: (1) the start of the line (2)
the word before the cursor (3) any non-word characters
between that word and the cursor (4) any non-word character
at the cursor position plus any remaining non-word
characters before the next word, including all charac- ters
specified by the skip-chars style, (5) the word at or fol-
lowing the cursor (6) any non-word characters following that
word (7) the remainder of the line. Any of the elements may
be an empty string; the calling function should test for
this to decide whether it can perform its function.</p>

<p>It is possible to pass options with arguments to
match-words-by-style to override the use of styles. The
options are: -w word-style -s skip-chars -c word-class -C
word-chars -r subword-range</p>

<p>For example, match-words-by-style -w shell -c 0 may be
used to extract the command argument around the cursor.</p>

<p>The word-context style is implemented by the function
match-word-context. This should not usually need to be
called directly.</p>

<p>delete-whole-word-match This is another function which
works like the -match functions described immediately above,
i.e. using styles to decide the word boundaries. However, it
is not a replacement for any existing function.</p>

<p>The basic behaviour is to delete the word around the
cursor. There is no numeric prefix handling; only the single
word around the cursor is considered. If the widget contains
the string kill, the removed text will be placed in the
cutbuffer for future yanking. This can be obtained by
defining kill-whole-word-match as follows:</p>

<p>zle -N kill-whole-word-match delete-whole-word-match</p>

<p>and then binding the widget kill-whole-word-match.</p>

<p>copy-earlier-word This widget works like a combination
of insert-last-word and copy-prev-shell-word. Repeated
invocations of the widget retrieve earlier words on the
relevant history line. With a numeric argument N, insert the
Nth word from the history line; N may be negative to count
from the end of the line.</p>

<p>If insert-last-word has been used to retrieve the last
word on a previous history line, repeated invocations will
replace that word with earlier words from the same line.</p>

<p>Otherwise, the widget applies to words on the line
currently being edited. The widget style can be set to the
name of another widget that should be called to retrieve
words. This widget must accept the same three arguments as
insert-last-word.</p>

<p>cycle-completion-positions After inserting an
unambiguous string into the command line, the new function
based completion system may know about multiple places in
this string where characters are missing or differ from at
least one of the possible matches. It will then place the
cursor on the position it considers to be the most interest-
ing one, i.e. the one where one can disambiguate between as
many matches as possible with as little typing as
possible.</p>

<p>This widget allows the cursor to be easily moved to the
other interesting spots. It can be invoked repeatedly to
cycle between all positions reported by the completion
system.</p>

<p>edit-command-line Edit the command line using your
visual editor, as in ksh.</p>

<p>bindkey -M vicmd v edit-command-line</p>

<p>history-search-end This function implements the widgets
history-begin- ning-search-backward-end and
history-beginning-search-for- ward-end. These commands work
by first calling the correspond- ing builtin widget (see
History Control in zshzle(1)) and then moving the cursor to
the end of the line. The original cursor position is
remembered and restored before calling the builtin widget a
second time, so that the same search is repeated to look
farther through the history.</p>

<p>Although you autoload only one function, the commands to
use it are slightly different because it implements two
widgets.</p>

<p>history-beginning-search-menu This function implements
yet another form of history searching. The text before the
cursor is used to select lines from the his- tory, as for
history-beginning-search-backward except that all matches
are shown in a numbered menu. Typing the appropriate digits
inserts the full history line. Note that leading zeroes must
be typed (they are only shown when necessary for removing
ambiguity). The entire history is searched; there is no dis-
tinction between forwards and backwards.</p>

<p>With a prefix argument, the search is not anchored to
the start of the line; the string typed by the use may
appear anywhere in the line in the history.</p>

<p>If the widget name contains -end the cursor is moved to
the end of the line inserted. If the widget name contains
-space any space in the text typed is treated as a wildcard
and can match anything (hence a leading space is equivalent
to giving a prefix argument). Both forms can be combined,
for example:</p>

<p>zle -N history-beginning-search-menu-space-end
history-beginning-search-menu</p>

<p>history-pattern-search The function
history-pattern-search implements widgets which prompt for a
pattern with which to search the history backwards or
forwards. The pattern is in the usual zsh format, however
the first character may be ^ to anchor the search to the
start of the line, and the last character may be $ to anchor
the search to the end of the line. If the search was not
anchored to the end of the line the cursor is positioned
just after the pattern found.</p>

<p>The commands to create bindable widgets are similar to
those in the example immediately above:</p>

<p>autoload -U history-pattern-search zle -N
history-pattern-search-backward history-pattern-search zle
-N history-pattern-search-forward history-pattern-search</p>

<p>up-line-or-beginning-search,
down-line-or-beginning-search These widgets are similar to
the builtin functions up-line-or-search and
down-line-or-search: if in a multiline buffer they move up
or down within the buffer, otherwise they search for a
history line matching the start of the current line. In this
case, however, they search for a line which matches the
current line up to the current cursor position, in the
manner of history-beginning-search-backward and -forward,
rather than the first word on the line.</p>

<p>incarg Typing the keystrokes for this widget with the
cursor placed on or to the left of an integer causes that
integer to be incre- mented by one. With a numeric prefix
argument, the number is incremented by the amount of the
argument (decremented if the prefix argument is negative).
The shell parameter incarg may be set to change the default
increment to something other than one.</p>

<p>bindkey^X+incarg</p>

<p>incremental-complete-word This allows incremental
completion of a word. After starting this command, a list of
completion choices can be shown after every character you
type, which you can delete with ^H or DEL. Pressing return
accepts the completion so far and returns you to normal
editing (that is, the command line is not immediately
executed). You can hit TAB to do normal completion, ^G to
abort back to the state when you started, and ^D to list the
matches.</p>

<p>This works only with the new function based completion
system.</p>

<p>bindkey^Xiincremental-complete-word</p>

<p>insert-composed-char This function allows you to compose
characters that dont appear on the keyboard to be inserted
into the command line. The com- mand is followed by two keys
corresponding to ASCII characters (there is no prompt). For
accented characters, the two keys are a base character
followed by a code for the accent, while for other special
characters the two characters together form a mnemonic for
the character to be inserted. The two-character codes are a
subset of those given by RFC 1345 (see for example
http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1345.html).</p>

<p>The function may optionally be followed by up to two
characters which replace one or both of the characters read
from the key- board; if both characters are supplied, no
input is read. For example, insert-composed-char a: can be
used within a widget to insert an a with umlaut into the
command line. This has the advantages over use of a literal
character that it is more portable.</p>

<p>For best results zsh should have been built with support
for multibyte characters (configured with
--enable-multibyte); how- ever, the function works for the
limited range of characters available in single-byte
character sets such as ISO-8859-1.</p>

<p>The character is converted into the local representation
and inserted into the command line at the cursor position.
(The conversion is done within the shell, using whatever
facilities the C library provides.) With a numeric argument,
the character and its code are previewed in the status
line</p>

<p>The function may be run outside zle in which case it
prints the character (together with a newline) to standard
output. Input is still read from keystrokes.</p>

<p>See insert-unicode-char for an alternative way of
inserting Uni- code characters using their hexadecimal
character number.</p>

<p>The set of accented characters is reasonably complete up
to Uni- code character U+0180, the set of special characters
less so. However, it it is very sporadic from that point.
Adding new characters is easy, however; see the function
define-com- posed-chars. Please send any additions to
zsh-workers@sun- site.dk.</p>

<p>The codes for the second character when used to accent
the first are as follows. Note that not every character can
take every accent. ! Grave. Acute. &gt; Circumflex. ? Tilde.
(This is not ~ as RFC 1345 does not assume that character is
present on the keyboard.) - Macron. (A horizontal bar over
the base character.) ( Breve. (A shallow dish shape over the
base character.) . Dot above the base character, or in the
case of i no dot, or in the case of L and l a centered dot.
: Diaeresis (Umlaut). c Cedilla. _ Underline, however there
are currently no underlined characters. / Stroke through the
base character. &quot; Double acute (only supported on a few
letters). ; Ogonek. (A little forward facing hook at the
bottom right of the character.) &lt; Caron. (A little v over
the letter.) 0 Circle over the base character. 2 Hook over
the base character. 9 Horn over the base character.</p>

<p>The most common characters from the Arabic, Cyrillic,
Greek and Hebrew alphabets are available; consult RFC 1345
for the appro- priate sequences. In addition, a set of two
letter codes not in RFC 1345 are available for the
double-width characters corre- sponding to ASCII characters
from ! to ~ (0x21 to 0x7e) by pre- ceding the character with
^, for example ^A for a double-width A.</p>

<p>The following other two-character sequences are
understood.</p>

<p>ASCII characters These are already present on most
keyboards: &lt;( Left square bracket // Backslash (solidus)
)&gt; Right square bracket (! Left brace (curly bracket) !!
Vertical bar (pipe symbol) !) Right brace (curly bracket) ?

<p>insert-files This function allows you type a file
pattern, and see the results of the expansion at each step.
When you hit return, all expansions are inserted into the
command line.</p>

<p>narrow-to-region [ -p pre ] [ -P post ] [ -S statepm |
-R statepm ] [ -n ] [ start end ])
narrow-to-region-invisible Narrow the editable portion of
the buffer to the region between the cursor and the mark,
which may be in either order. The region may not be
empty.</p>

<p>narrow-to-region may be used as a widget or called as a
function from a user-defined widget; by default, the text
outside the editable area remains visible. A recursive-edit
is performed and the original widening status is then
restored. Various options and arguments are available when
it is called as a func- tion.</p>

<p>The options -p pretext and -P posttext may be used to
replace the text before and after the display for the
duration of the function; either or both may be an empty
string.</p>

<p>If the option -n is also given, pretext or posttext will
only be inserted if there is text before or after the region
respec- tively which will be made invisible.</p>

<p>Two numeric arguments may be given which will be used
instead of the cursor and mark positions.</p>

<p>The option -S statepm is used to narrow according to the
other options while saving the original state in the
parameter with name statepm, while the option -R statepm is
used to restore the state from the parameter; note in both
cases the name of the parameter is required. In the second
case, other options and arguments are irrelevant. When this
method is used, no recur- sive-edit is performed; the
calling widget should call this function with the option -S,
perform its own editing on the com- mand line or pass
control to the user via zle recursive-edit, then call this
function with the option -R. The argument statepm must be a
suitable name for an ordinary parameter, except that
parameters beginning with the prefix _ntr_ are reserved for
use within narrow-to-region. Typically the parame- ter will
be local to the calling function.</p>

<p>narrow-to-region-invisible is a simple widget which
calls nar- row-to-region with arguments which replace any
text outside the region with ....</p>

<p>The display is restored (and the widget returns) upon
any zle command which would usually cause the line to be
accepted or aborted. Hence an additional such command is
required to accept or abort the current line.</p>

<p>The return status of both widgets is zero if the line
was accepted, else non-zero.</p>

<p>Here is a trivial example of a widget using this
feature. local state narrow-to-region -p Editing restricted
region -P-S state zle recursive-edit narrow-to-region -R
state</p>

<p>insert-unicode-char When first executed, the user inputs
a set of hexadecimal dig- its. This is terminated with
another call to insert-uni- code-char. The digits are then
turned into the corresponding Unicode character. For
example, if the widget is bound to ^XU, the character
sequence ^XU 4 c ^XU inserts L (Unicode U+004c).</p>

<p>See insert-composed-char for a way of inserting
characters using a two-character mnemonic.</p>

<p>predict-on This set of functions implements predictive
typing using history search. After predict-on, typing
characters causes the editor to look backward in the history
for the first line beginning with what you have typed so
far. After predict-off, editing returns to normal for the
line found. In fact, you often dont even need to use
predict-off, because if the line doesnt match something in
the history, adding a key performs standard comple- tion,
and then inserts itself if no completions were found.
However, editing in the middle of a line is liable to
confuse prediction; see the toggle style below.</p>

<p>With the function based completion system (which is
needed for this), you should be able to type TAB at almost
any point to advance the cursor to the next interesting
character posi- tion (usually the end of the current word,
but sometimes some- where in the middle of the word). And of
course as soon as the entire line is what you want, you can
accept with return, with- out needing to move the cursor to
the end first.</p>

<p>The first time predict-on is used, it creates several
additional widget functions:</p>

<p>delete-backward-and-predict Replaces the
backward-delete-char widget. You do not need to bind this
yourself. insert-and-predict Implements predictive typing by
replacing the self-insert widget. You do not need to bind
this yourself. predict-off Turns off predictive typing.</p>

<p>Although you autoload only the predict-on function, it
is neces- sary to create a keybinding for predict-off as
well.</p>

<p>zle -N predict-on zle -N predict-off
bindkey^X^Zpredict-on bindkey^Zpredict-off</p>

<p>read-from-minibuffer This is most useful when called as
a function from inside a wid- get, but will work correctly
as a widget in its own right. It prompts for a value below
the current command line; a value may be input using all of
the standard zle operations (and not merely the restricted
set available when executing, for example,
execute-named-cmd). The value is then returned to the
calling function in the parameter $REPLY and the editing
buffer restored to its previous state. If the read was
aborted by a keyboard break (typically ^G), the function
returns status 1 and $REPLY is not set.</p>

<p>If one argument is supplied to the function it is taken
as a prompt, otherwise ? is used. If two arguments are
supplied, they are the prompt and the initial value of
$LBUFFER, and if a third argument is given it is the initial
value of $RBUFFER. This provides a default value and
starting cursor placement. Upon return the entire buffer is
the value of $REPLY.</p>

<p>One option is available: -k num specifies that num
characters are to be read instead of a whole line. The line
editor is not invoked recursively in this case, so depending
on the terminal settings the input may not be visible, and
only the input keys are placed in $REPLY, not the entire
buffer. Note that unlike the read builtin num must be given;
there is no default.</p>

<p>The name is a slight misnomer, as in fact the shells own
minibuffer is not used. Hence it is still possible to call
exe- cuted-named-cmd and similar functions while reading a
value.</p>

<p>replace-string, replace-pattern replace-string-again,
replace-pattern-again The function replace-string implements
two widgets. If defined under the same name as the function,
it prompts for two strings; the first (source) string will
be replaced by the second every- where it occurs in the line
editing buffer.</p>

<p>If the widget name contains the word pattern, for
example by defining the widget using the command zle -N
replace-pattern replace-string , then the replacement is
done by pattern match- ing. All zsh extended globbing
patterns can be used in the source string; note that unlike
filename generation the pattern does not need to match an
entire word, nor do glob qualifiers have any effect. In
addition, the replacement string can con- tain parameter or
command substitutions. Furthermore, a &amp; in the
replacement string will be replaced with the matched source
string, and a backquoted digitN will be replaced by the Nth
parenthesised expression matched. The for{N} may be used to
protect the digit from following digits.</p>

<p>By default the previous source or replacement string
will not be offered for editing. However, this feature can
be activated by setting the style edit-previous in the
context :zle:widget (for example, :zle:replace-string) to
true. In addition, a positive numeric argument forces the
previous values to be offered, a negative or zero argument
forces them not to be.</p>

<p>The function replace-string-again can be used to repeat
the pre- vious replacement; no prompting is done. As with
replace-string, if the name of the widget contains the word
pattern, pattern matching is performed, else a literal
string replacement. Note that the previous source and
replacement text are the same whether pattern or string
matching is used.</p>

<p>For example, starting from the line:</p>

<p>print This line contains fan and fond</p>

<p>and invoking replace-pattern with the source string
f(?)n and the replacement string 1r produces the not very
useful line:</p>

<p>print This line contains car and cord</p>

<p>The range of the replacement string can be limited by
using the narrow-to-region-invisible widget. One limitation
of the cur- rent version is that undo will cycle through
changes to the replacement and source strings before undoing
the replacement itself.</p>

<p>smart-insert-last-word This function may replace the
insert-last-word widget, like so:</p>

<p>zle -N insert-last-word smart-insert-last-word</p>

<p>With a numeric prefix, or when passed command line
arguments in a call from another widget, it behaves like
insert-last-word, except that words in comments are ignored
when INTERACTIVE_COM- MENTS is set.</p>

<p>Otherwise, the rightmost interesting word from the
previous command is found and inserted. The default
definition of interesting is that the word contains at least
one alpha- betic character, slash, or backslash. This
definition may be overridden by use of the match style. The
context used to look up the style is the widget name, so
usually the context is :insert-last-word. However, you can
bind this function to dif- ferent widgets to use different
patterns:</p>

<p>zle -N insert-last-assignment smart-insert-last-word
zstyle :insert-last-assignment match
[[:alpha:]][][[:alnum:]]#=*
bindkee=insert-last-assignment</p>

<p>If no interesting word is found and the auto-previous
style is set to a true value, the search continues upward
through the history. When auto-previous is unset or false
(the default), the widget must be invoked repeatedly in
order to search earlier history lines.</p>

<p>which-command This function is a drop-in replacement for
the builtin widget which-command. It has enhanced behaviour,
in that it correctly detects whether or not the command word
needs to be expanded as an alias; if so, it continues
tracing the command word from the expanded alias until it
reaches the command that will be exe- cuted.</p>

<p>The style whence is available in the context
:zle:$WIDGET; this may be set to an array to give the
command and options that will be used to investigate the
command word found. The default is whence -c.</p>

<p>Utility Functions These functions are useful in
constructing widgets. They should be loaded with autoload -U
function and called as indicated from user-defined
widgets.</p>

<p>split-shell-arguments This function splits the line
currently being edited into shell arguments and whitespace.
The result is stored in the array reply. The array contains
all the parts of the line in order, starting with any
whitespace before the first argument, and fin- ishing with
any whitespace after the last argument. Hence (so long as
the option KSH_ARRAYS is not set) whitespace is given by odd
indices in the array and arguments by even indices. Note
that no stripping of quotes is done; joining together all
the elements of reply in order is guaranteed to produce the
original line.</p>

<p>The parameter REPLY is set to the index of the word in
reply which contains the character after the cursor, where
the first element has index 1. The parameter REPLY2 is set
to the index of the character under the cursor in that word,
where the first character has index 1.</p>

<p>Hence reply, REPLY and REPLY2 should all be made local
to the enclosing function.</p>

<p>See the function modify-current-argument, described
below, for an example of how to call this function.</p>

<p>modify-current-argument expr-using-$ARG This function
provides a simple method of allowing user-defined widgets to
modify the command line argument under the cursor (or
immediately to the left of the cursor if the cursor is
between arguments). The argument should be an expression
which when evaluated operates on the shell parameter ARG,
which will have been set to the command line argument under
the cursor. The expression should be suitably quoted to
prevent it being evalu- ated too early.</p>

<p>For example, a user-defined widget containing the
following code converts the characters in the argument under
the cursor into all upper case:</p>

<p>modify-current-argument${(U)ARG}</p>

<p>The following strips any quoting from the current word
(whether backslashes or one of the styles of quotes), and
replaces it with single quoting throughout:</p>

<p>modify-current-argument${(qq)${(Q)ARG}}</p>

<p>Styles The behavior of several of the above widgets can
be controlled by the use of the zstyle mechanism. In
particular, widgets that interact with the completion system
pass along their context to any completions that they
invoke.</p>

<p>break-keys This style is used by the
incremental-complete-word widget. Its value should be a
pattern, and all keys matching this pattern will cause the
widget to stop incremental completion without the key having
any further effect. Like all styles used directly by
incremental-complete-word, this style is looked up using the
context :incremental.</p>

<p>completer The incremental-complete-word and
insert-and-predict widgets set up their top-level context
name before calling completion. This allows one to define
different sets of completer functions for normal completion
and for these widgets. For example, to use completion,
approximation and correction for normal completion,
completion and correction for incremental completion and
only completion for prediction one could use:</p>

<p>zstyle :completion:* completer _complete _correct
_approximate zstyle :completion:incremental:* completer
_complete _correct zstyle :completion:predict:* completer
_complete</p>

<p>It is a good idea to restrict the completers used in
prediction, because they may be automatically invoked as you
type. The _list and _menu completers should never be used
with prediction. The _approximate, _correct, _expand, and
_match completers may be used, but be aware that they may
change characters anywhere in the word behind the cursor, so
you need to watch carefully that the result is what you
intended.</p>

<p>cursor The insert-and-predict widget uses this style, in
the context :predict, to decide where to place the cursor
after completion has been tried. Values are:</p>

<p>complete The cursor is left where it was when completion
finished, but only if it is after a character equal to the
one just inserted by the user. If it is after another
character, this value is the same as key.</p>

<p>key The cursor is left after the nth occurrence of the
char- acter just inserted, where n is the number of times
that character appeared in the word before completion was
attempted. In short, this has the effect of leaving the
cursor after the character just typed even if the comple-
tion code found out that no other characters need to be
inserted at that position.</p>

<p>Any other value for this style unconditionally leaves
the cursor at the position where the completion code left
it.</p>

<p>list When using the incremental-complete-word widget,
this style says if the matches should be listed on every key
press (if they fit on the screen). Use the context prefix
:completion:incremen- tal.</p>

<p>The insert-and-predict widget uses this style to decide
if the completion should be shown even if there is only one
possible completion. This is done if the value of this style
is the string always. In this case the context is :predict
(not :completion:predict).</p>

<p>match This style is used by smart-insert-last-word to
provide a pat- tern (using full EXTENDED_GLOB syntax) that
matches an interest- ing word. The context is the name of
the widget to which smart-insert-last-word is bound (see
above). The default behav- ior of smart-insert-last-word is
equivalent to:</p>

<p>zstyle :insert-last-word match*[[:alpha:]]*</p>

<p>However, you might want to include words that contain
spaces:</p>

<p>zstyle :insert-last-word match
*[[:alpha:][:space:]]*</p>

<p>Or include numbers as long as the word is at least two
charac- ters long:</p>

<p>zstyle :insert-last-word match
*([[:digit:]]?|[[:alpha:]])*</p>

<p>The above example causes redirections like
&quot;2&gt;&quot; to be included.</p>

<p>prompt The incremental-complete-word widget shows the
value of this style in the status line during incremental
completion. The string value may contain any of the
following substrings in the manner of the PS1 and other
prompt parameters:</p>

<p>%c Replaced by the name of the completer function that
gen- erated the matches (without the leading
underscore).</p>

<p>%l When the list style is set, replaced by ... if the
list of matches is too long to fit on the screen and with an
empty string otherwise. If the list style is false or not
set, %l is always removed.</p>

<p>%n Replaced by the number of matches generated.</p>

<p>%s Replaced by -no match-, -no prefix- , or an empty
string if there is no completion matching the word on the
line, if the matches have no common prefix different from
the word on the line, or if there is such a common pre- fix,
respectively.</p>

<p>%u Replaced by the unambiguous part of all matches, if
there is any, and if it is different from the word on the
line.</p>

<p>Like break-keys , this uses the :incremental
context.</p>

<p>stop-keys This style is used by the
incremental-complete-word widget. Its value is treated
similarly to the one for the break-keys style (and uses the
same context: :incremental ). However, in this case all keys
matching the pattern given as its value will stop
incremental completion and will then execute their usual
func- tion.</p>

<p>toggle This boolean style is used by predict-on and its
related widgets in the context :predict . If set to one of
the standard true values, predictive typing is automatically
toggled off in situa- tions where it is unlikely to be
useful, such as when editing a multi-line buffer or after
moving into the middle of a line and then deleting a
character. The default is to leave prediction turned on
until an explicit call to predict-off.</p>

<p>verbose This boolean style is used by predict-on and its
related widgets in the context :predict . If set to one of
the standard true values, these widgets display a message
below the prompt when the predictive state is toggled. This
is most useful in combi- nation with the toggle style. The
default does not display these messages.</p>

<p>widget This style is similar to the command style: For
widget functions that use zle to call other widgets, this
style can sometimes be used to override the widget which is
called. The context for this style is the name of the
calling widget (not the name of the calling function,
because one function may be bound to mul- tiple widget
names).</p>

<p>zstyle :copy-earlier-word widget
smart-insert-last-word</p>

<p>Check the documentation for the calling widget or
function to determine whether the widget style is used.</p>

<p>EXCEPTION HANDLING Two functions are provided to enable
zsh to provide exception handling in a form that should be
familiar from other languages.</p>

<p>throw exception The function throw throws the named
exception. The name is an arbitrary string and is only used
by the throw and catch func- tions. An exception is for the
most part treated the same as a shell error, i.e. an
unhandled exception will cause the shell to abort all
processing in a function or script and to return to the top
level in an interactive shell.</p>

<p>catch exception-pattern The function catch returns
status zero if an exception was thrown and the pattern
exception-pattern matches its name. Oth- erwise it returns
status 1. exception-pattern is a standard shell pattern,
respecting the current setting of the EXTENDED_GLOB option.
An alias catch is also defined to prevent the argument to
the function from matching filenames, so pat- terns may be
used unquoted. Note that as exceptions are not fundamentally
different from other shell errors it is possible to catch
shell errors by using an empty string as the exception name.
The shell variable CAUGHT is set by catch to the name of the
exception caught. It is possible to rethrow an exception by
calling the throw function again once an exception has been
caught.</p>

<p>The functions are designed to be used together with the
always con- struct described in zshmisc(1). This is
important as only this con- struct provides the required
support for exceptions. A typical example is as follows.</p>

<p>{ # &quot;try&quot; block # ... nested code here calls
&quot;throw MyExcept&quot; } always { # &quot;always&quot;
block if catch MyExcept; then print &quot;Caught exception
MyExcept&quot; elif catc; then print &quot;Caught a shell
error. Propagating...&quot; throw fi # Other exceptions are
not handled but may be caught further # up the call stack.
}</p>

<p>If all exceptions should be caught, the following idiom
might be preferable.</p>

<p>{ # ... nested code here throws an exception } always {
if catch *; then case $CAUGHT in (MyExcept) print
&quot;Caught my own exception&quot; ;; (*) print
&quot;Caught some other exception&quot; ;; esac fi }</p>

<p>In common with exception handling in other languages,
the exception may be thrown by code deeply nested inside the
try block. However, note that it must be thrown inside the
current shell, not in a subshell forked for a pipeline,
parenthesised current-shell construct, or some form of
command or process substitution.</p>

<p>The system internally uses the shell variable EXCEPTION
to record the name of the exception between throwing and
catching. One drawback of this scheme is that if the
exception is not handled the variable EXCEP- TION remains
set and may be incorrectly recognised as the name of an
exception if a shell error subsequently occurs. Adding unset
EXCEPTION at the start of the outermost layer of any code
that uses exception handling will eliminate this
problem.</p>

<p>MIME FUNCTIONS Three functions are available to provide
handling of files recognised by extension, for example to
dispatch a file text.ps when executed as a command to an
appropriate viewer.</p>

<p>zsh-mime-setup [ -fv ] [ -l [ suffix ... ] ]
zsh-mime-handler These two functions use the files
~/.mime.types and /etc/mime.types, which associate types and
extensions, as well as ~/.mailcap and /etc/mailcap files,
which associate types and the programs that handle them.
These are provided on many sys- tems with the Multimedia
Internet Mail Extensions.</p>

<p>To enable the system, the function zsh-mime-setup should
be autoloaded and run. This allows files with extensions to
be treated as executable; such files be completed by the
function completion system. The function zsh-mime-handler
should not need to be called by the user.</p>

<p>The system works by setting up suffix aliases with alias
-s. Suffix aliases already installed by the user will not be
over- written.</p>

<p>For suffixes defined in lower case, upper case variants
will also automatically be handled (e.g. PDF is
automatically handled if handling for the suffix pdf is
defined), but not vice versa.</p>

<p>Repeated calls to zsh-mime-setup do not override the
existing mapping between suffixes and executable files
unless the option -f is given. Note, however, that this does
not override exist- ing suffix aliases assigned to handlers
other than zsh-mime-han- dler.</p>

<p>Calling zsh-mime-setup with the option -l lists the
existing mappings without altering them. Suffixes to list
(which may contain pattern characters that should be quoted
from immediate interpretation on the command line) may be
given as additional arguments, otherwise all suffixes are
listed.</p>

<p>Calling zsh-mime-setup with the option -v causes verbose
output to be shown during the setup operation.</p>

<p>The system respects the mailcap flags needsterminal and
copi- ousoutput, see mailcap(4).</p>

<p>The functions use the following styles, which are
defined with the zstyle builtin command (see zshmodules(1)).
They should be defined before zsh-mime-setup is run. The
contexts used all start with :mime:, with additional
components in some cases. It is recommended that a trailing
* (suitably quoted) be appended to style patterns in case
the system is extended in future. Some examples are given
below. current-shell If this boolean style is true, the
mailcap handler for the context in question is run using the
eval builtin instead of by starting a new sh process. This
is more efficient, but may not work in the occasional cases
where the mailcap handler uses strict POSIX syntax.</p>

<p>execute-as-is This style gives a list of patterns to be
matched against files passed for execution with a handler
program. If the file matches the pattern, the entire command
line is executed in its current form, with no handler. This
is useful for files which might have suffixes but nonethe-
less be executable in their own right. If the style is not
set, the pattern *(*) *(/) is used; hence executable files
are executed directly and not passed to a handler, and the
option AUTO_CD may be used to change to directo- ries that
happen to have MIME suffixes.</p>

<p>file-path Used if the style find-file-in-path is true
for the same context. Set to an array of directories that
are used for searching for the file to be handled; the
default is the command path given by the special parameter
path. The shell option PATH_DIRS is respected; if that is
set, the appropriate path will be searched even if the name
of the file to be handled as it appears on the command line
contains a / . The full context is :mime:.suffix:, as
described for the style handler.</p>

<p>find-file-in-path If set, allows files whose names do
not contain absolute paths to be searched for in the command
path or the path specified by the file-path style. If the
file is not found in the path, it is looked for locally
(whether or not the current directory is in the path); if it
is not found locally, the handler will abort unless the han-
dle-nonexistent style is set. Files found in the path are
tested as described for the style execute-as-is. The full
context is :mime:.suffix:, as described for the style
handler.</p>

<p>flags Defines flags to go with a handler; the context is
as for the handler style, and the format is as for the flags
in mailcap.</p>

<p>handle-nonexistent By default, arguments that dont
correspond to files are not passed to the MIME handler in
order to prevent it from intercepting commands found in the
path that happen to have suffixes. This style may be set to
an array of extended glob patterns for arguments that will
be passed to the handler even if they dont exist. If it is
not explicitly set it defaults to [[:alpha:]]#:/* which
allows URLs to be passed to the MIME handler even though
they dont exist in that format in the file system. The full
context is :mime:.suffix:, as described for the style
handler.</p>

<p>handler Specifies a handler for a suffix; the suffix is
given by the context as :mime:.suffix:, and the format of
the han- dler is exactly that in mailcap. Note in particular
the . and trailing colon to distinguish this use of the
context. This overrides any handler specified by the mailcap
files. If the handler requires a terminal, the flags style
should be set to include the word needstermi- nal, or if the
output is to be displayed through a pager (but not if the
handler is itself a pager), it should include
copiousoutput.</p>

<p>mailcap A list of files in the format of ~/.mailcap and
/etc/mailcap to be read during setup, replacing the default
list which consists of those two files. The con- text is
:mime:. A + in the list will be replaced by the default
files.</p>

<p>mailcap-priorities This style is used to resolve
multiple mailcap entries for the same MIME type. It consists
of an array of the following elements, in descending order
of priority; later entries will be used if earlier entries
are unable to resolve the entries being compared. If none of
the tests resolve the entries, the first entry encountered
is retained.</p>

<p>files The order of files (entries in the mailcap style)
read. Earlier files are preferred. (Note this does not
resolve entries in the same file.)</p>

<p>priority The priority flag from the mailcap entry. The
priority is an integer from 0 to 9 with the default value
being 5.</p>

<p>flags The test given by the mailcap-prio-flags option is
used to resolve entries.</p>

<p>place Later entries are preferred; as the entries are
strictly ordered, this test always succeeds.</p>

<p>Note that as this style is handled during
initialisation, the context is always :mime:, with no
discrimination by suffix.</p>

<p>mailcap-prio-flags This style is used when the keyword
flags is encountered in the list of tests specified by the
mailcap-priorities style. It should be set to a list of
patterns, each of which is tested against the flags
specified in the mail- cap entry (in other words, the sets
of assignments found with some entries in the mailcap file).
Earlier patterns in the list are preferred to later ones,
and matched pat- terns are preferred to unmatched ones.</p>

<p>mime-types A list of files in the format of
~/.mime.types and /etc/mime.types to be read during setup,
replacing the default list which consists of those two
files. The con- text is :mime:. A + in the list will be
replaced by the default files.</p>

<p>never-background If this boolean style is set, the
handler for the given context is always run in the
foreground, even if the flags provided in the mailcap entry
suggest it need not be (for example, it doesn t require a
terminal).</p>

<p>pager If set, will be used instead of $PAGER or more to
handle suffixes where the copiousoutput flag is set. The
con- text is as for handler, i.e. :mime:.suffix: for
handling a file with the given suffix.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<p>zstyle :mime:* mailcap ~/.mailcap /usr/local/etc/mailcap
zstyle:mime:.txt:handler less %s zstyle:mime:.txt:flags
needsterminal</p>

<p>When zsh-mime-setup is subsequently run, it will look
for mail- cap entries in the two files given. Files of
suffix .txt will be handled by running less file.txt . The
flag needsterminal is set to show that this program must run
attached to a termi- nal.</p>

<p>As there are several steps to dispatching a command, the
follow- ing should be checked if attempting to execute a
file by exten- sion .ext does not have the expected
effect.</p>

<p>The command alias -s ext should show
ps=zsh-mime-handler. If it shows something else, another
suffix alias was already installed and was not overwritten.
If it shows nothing, no han- dler was installed: this is
most likely because no handler was found in the .mime.types
and mailcap combination for .ext files. In that case,
appropriate handling should be added to ~/.mime.types and
mailcap.</p>

<p>If the extension is handled by zsh-mime-handler but the
file is not opened correctly, either the handler defined for
the type is incorrect, or the flags associated with it are
in appropriate. Running zsh-mime-setup -l will show the
handler and, if there are any, the flags. A %s in the
handler is replaced by the file (suitably quoted if
necessary). Check that the handler program listed lists and
can be run in the way shown. Also check that the flags
needsterminal or copiousoutput are set if the handler needs
to be run under a terminal; the second flag is used if the
output should be sent to a pager. An example of a suitable
mailcap entry for such a program is:</p>

<p>text/html; /usr/bin/lynx%; needsterminal</p>

<p>pick-web-browser This function is separate from the two
MIME functions described above and can be assigned directly
to a suffix:</p>

<p>autoload -U pick-web-browser alias -s
html=pick-web-browser</p>

<p>It is provided as an intelligent front end to dispatch a
web browser. It may be run as either a function or a shell
script. The status 255 is returned if no browser could be
started.</p>

<p>Various styles are available to customize the choice of
browsers:</p>

<p>browser-style The value of the style is an array giving
preferences in decreasing order for the type of browser to
use. The values of elements may be</p>

<p>running Use a GUI browser that is already running when
an X Window display is available. The browsers listed in the
x-browsers style are tried in order until one is found; if
it is, the file will be displayed in that browser, so the
user may need to check whether it has appeared. If no
running browser is found, one is not started. Browsers other
than Firefox, Opera and Konqueror are assumed to understand
the Mozilla syntax for opening a URL remotely.</p>

<p>x Start a new GUI browser when an X Window display is
available. Search for the availability of one of the
browsers listed in the x-browsers style and start the first
one that is found. No check is made for an already running
browser.</p>

<p>tty Start a terminal-based browser. Search for the
availability of one of the browsers listed in the
tty-browsers style and start the first one that is
found.</p>

<p>If the style is not set the default running x tty is
used.</p>

<p>x-browsers An array in decreasing order of preference of
browsers to use when running under the X Window System. The
array consists of the command name under which to start the
browser. They are looked up in the context :mime: (which may
be extended in future, so appending * is recom- mended). For
example,</p>

<p>zstyle :mime:* x-browsers opera konqueror firefox</p>

<p>specifies that pick-web-browser should first look for a
running instance of Opera, Konqueror or Firefox, in that
order, and if it fails to find any should attempt to start
Opera. The default is firefox mozilla netscape opera
konqueror.</p>

<p>tty-browsers An array similar to x-browsers, except that
it gives browsers to use use when no X Window display is
avail- able. The default is elinks links lynx.</p>

<p>command If it is set this style is used to pick the
command used to open a page for a browser. The context is
:mime:browser:new:$browser: to start a new browser or
:mime:browser:running:$browser: to open a URL in a browser
already running on the current X display, where $browser is
the value matched in the x-browsers or tty-browsers style.
The escape sequence %b in the style s value will be replaced
by the browser, while %u will be replaced by the URL. If the
style is not set, the default for all new instances is
equivalent to %b %u and the defaults for using running
browsers are equiva- lent to the values kfmclient openURL %u
for Konqueror, firefox -new-tab %u for Firefox, opera
-newpage %u for Opera, and %b -remote
&quot;openUrl(%u)&quot; for all others.</p>

<p>MATHEMATICAL FUNCTIONS zcalc [ expression ... ] A
reasonably powerful calculator based on zshs arithmetic
eval- uation facility. The syntax is similar to that of
formulae in most programming languages; see the section
Arithmetic Evalua- tion in zshmisc(1) for details. The
mathematical library zsh/mathfunc will be loaded if it is
available; see the section The zsh/mathfunc Module in
zshmodules(1). The mathematical functions correspond to the
raw system libraries, so trigonomet- ric functions are
evaluated using radians, and so on.</p>

<p>Each line typed is evaluated as an expression. The
prompt shows a number, which corresponds to a positional
parameter where the result of that calculation is stored.
For example, the result of the calculation on the line
preceded by 4&gt; is available as $4. The last value
calculated is available as ans. Full com- mand line editing,
including the history of previous calcula- tions, is
available; the history is saved in the file
~/.zcalc_history. To exit, enter a blank line or type :q on
its own ( q is allowed for historical compatibility).</p>

<p>If arguments are given to zcalc on start up, they are
used to prime the first few positional parameters. A visual
indication of this is given when the calculator starts.</p>

<p>The constants PI (3.14159...) and E (2.71828...) are
provided. Parameter assignment is possible, but note that
all parameters will be put into the global namespace.</p>

<p>The output base can be initialised by passing the option
-#base , for example zcalc -#16 (the # may have to be
quoted, depending on the globbing options set).</p>

<p>The prompt is configurable via the parameter
ZCALCPROMPT, which undergoes standard prompt expansion. The
index of the current entry is stored locally in the first
element of the array psvar, which can be referred to in
ZCALCPROMPT as %1v. The default prompt is %1v&gt; .</p>

<p>A few special commands are available; these are
introduced by a colon. For backward compatibility, the colon
may be omitted for certain commands. Completion is available
if compinit has been run.</p>

<p>The output precision may be specified within zcalc by
special commands familiar from many calculators. :norm The
default output format. It corresponds to the printf %g
specification. Typically this shows six decimal dig-
its.</p>

<p>:sci digits Scientific notation, corresponding to the
printf %g out- put format with the precision given by
digits. This pro- duces either fixed point or exponential
notation depend- ing on the value output.</p>

<p>:fix digits Fixed point notation, corresponding to the
printf %f out- put format with the precision given by
digits.</p>

<p>:eng digits Exponential notation, corresponding to the
printf %E out- put format with the precision given by
digits.</p>

<p>:raw Raw output: this is the default form of the output
from a math evaluation. This may show more precision than
the number actually possesses.</p>

<p>Other special commands: :!line... Execute line... as a
normal shell command line. Note that it is executed in the
context of the function, i.e. with local variables. Space is
optional after :!.</p>

<p>:local arg ... Declare variables local to the function.
Note that cer- tain variables are used by the function for
its own pur- poses. Other variables may be used, too, but
they will be taken from or put into the global scope.</p>

<p>:function name [ body ] Define a mathematical function
or (with no body) delete it. The function is defined using
zmathfuncdef, see below.</p>

<p>Note that zcalc takes care of all quoting. Hence for
example:</p>

<p>function cube $1 * $1 * $1</p>

<p>defines a function to cube the sole argument.</p>

<p>[#base] This is not a special command, rather part of
normal arithmetic syntax; however, when this form appears on
a line by itself the default output radix is set to base.
Use, for example, [#16] to display hexadecimal output
preceded by an indication of the base, or [##16] just to
display the raw number in the given base. Bases them- selves
are always specified in decimal. [#] restores the normal
output format. Note that setting an output base suppresses
floating point output; use [#] to return to normal
operation.</p>

<p>See the comments in the function for a few extra
tips.</p>

<p>zmathfuncdef [ mathfunc [ body ] ] A convenient front
end to functions -M.</p>

<p>With two arguments, define a mathematical function named
math- func which can be used in any form of arithmetic
evaluation. body is a mathematical expression to implement
the function. It may contain references to position
parameters $1, $2, ... to refer to mandatory parameters and
${1:-defvalue} ... to refer to optional parameters. Note
that the forms must be strictly adhered to for the function
to calculate the correct number of arguments. The
implementation is held in a shell function named
zsh_math_func_mathfunc; usually the user will not need to
refer to the shell function directly. Any existing function
of the same name is silently replaced.</p>

<p>With one argument, remove the mathematical function
mathfunc as well as the shell function implementation.</p>

<p>With no arguments, list all mathfunc functions in a form
suit- able for restoring the definition. The functions have
not nec- essarily been defined by zmathfuncdef.</p>

<p>USER CONFIGURATION FUNCTIONS The zsh/newuser module
comes with a function to aid in configuring shell options
for new users. If the module is installed, this function can
also be run by hand. It is available even if the modules
default behaviour, namely running the function for a new
user logging in with- out startup files, is inhibited.</p>

<p>zsh-newuser-install [ -f ] The function presents the
user with various options for cus- tomizing their
initialization scripts. Currently only ~/.zshrc is handled.
$ZDOTDIR/.zshrc is used instead if the parameter ZDOTDIR is
set; this provides a way for the user to configure a file
without altering an existing .zshrc.</p>

<p>By default the function exits immediately if it finds
any of the files .zshenv, .zprofile, .zshrc, or .zlogin in
the appropriate directory. The option -f is required in
order to force the function to continue. Note this may
happen even if .zshrc itself does not exist.</p>

<p>As currently configured, the function will exit
immediately if the user has root privileges; this behaviour
cannot be overrid- den.</p>

<p>Once activated, the function s behaviour is supposed to
be self-explanatory. Menus are present allowing the user to
alter the value of options and parameters. Suggestions for
improve- ments are always welcome.</p>

<p>When the script exits, the user is given the opportunity
to save the new file or not; changes are not irreversible
until this point. However, the script is careful to restrict
changes to the file only to a group marked by the lines #
Lines configured by zsh-newuser-install and # End of lines
configured by zsh-newuser-install . In addition, the old
version of .zshrc is saved to a file with the suffix .zni
appended.</p>

<p>If the function edits an existing .zshrc, it is up to
the user to ensure that the changes made will take effect.
For example, if control usually returns early from the
existing .zshrc the lines will not be executed; or a later
initialization file may override options or parameters, and
so on. The function itself does not attempt to detect any
such conflicts.</p>

<p>OTHER FUNCTIONS There are a large number of helpful
functions in the Functions/Misc directory of the zsh
distribution. Most are very simple and do not require
documentation here, but a few are worthy of special
mention.</p>

<p>Descriptions colors This function initializes several
associative arrays to map color names to (and from) the ANSI
standard eight-color terminal codes. These are used by the
prompt theme system (see above). You seldom should need to
run colors more than once.</p>

<p>The eight base colors are: black, red, green, yellow,
blue, magenta, cyan, and white. Each of these has codes for
fore- ground and background. In addition there are eight
intensity attributes: bold, faint, standout, underline,
blink, reverse, and conceal. Finally, there are six codes
used to negate attributes: none (reset all attributes to the
defaults), normal (neither bold nor faint), no-standout,
no-underline, no-blink, and no-reverse.</p>

<p>Some terminals do not support all combinations of colors
and intensities.</p>

<p>The associative arrays are:</p>

<p>color colour Map all the color names to their integer
codes, and inte- ger codes to the color names. The eight
base names map to the foreground color codes, as do names
prefixed with fg- , such as fg-red. Names prefixed with bg-,
such as bg-blue, refer to the background codes. The reverse
mapping from code to color yields base name for fore- ground
codes and the bg- form for backgrounds.</p>

<p>Although it is a misnomer to call them colors, these
arrays also map the other fourteen attributes from names to
codes and codes to names.</p>

<p>fg fg_bold fg_no_bold Map the eight basic color names to
ANSI terminal escape sequences that set the corresponding
foreground text properties. The fg sequences change the
color without changing the eight intensity attributes.</p>

<p>bg bg_bold bg_no_bold Map the eight basic color names to
ANSI terminal escape sequences that set the corresponding
background proper- ties. The bg sequences change the color
without changing the eight intensity attributes.</p>

<p>In addition, the scalar parameters reset_color and
bold_color are set to the ANSI terminal escapes that turn
off all attributes and turn on bold intensity,
respectively.</p>

<p>fned name Same as zed -f. This function does not appear
in the zsh dis- tribution, but can be created by linking zed
to the name fned in some directory in your fpath.</p>

<p>is-at-least needed [ present ] Perform a
greater-than-or-equal-to comparison of two strings having
the format of a zsh version number; that is, a string of
numbers and text with segments separated by dots or dashes.
If the present string is not provided, $ZSH_VERSION is used.
Seg- ments are paired left-to-right in the two strings with
leading non-number parts ignored. If one string has fewer
segments than the other, the missing segments are considered
zero.</p>

<p>This is useful in startup files to set options and other
state that are not available in all versions of zsh.</p>

<p>is-at-least 3.1.6-15 &amp;&amp; setopt NO_GLOBAL_RCS
is-at-least 3.1.0 &amp;&amp; setopt HIST_REDUCE_BLANKS
is-at-least 2.6-17 || print &quot;You can t use is-at-least
here.&quot;</p>

<p>nslookup [ arg ... ] This wrapper function for the
nslookup command requires the zsh/zpty module (see
zshmodules(1)). It behaves exactly like the standard
nslookup except that it provides customizable prompts
(including a right-side prompt) and completion of nslookup
commands, host names, etc. (if you use the func- tion-based
completion system). Completion styles may be set with the
context prefix :completion:nslookup.</p>

<p>See also the pager, prompt and rprompt styles below.</p>

<p>run-help cmd This function is designed to be invoked by
the run-help ZLE wid- get, in place of the default alias.
See Accessing On-Line Help above for setup instructions.</p>

<p>In the discussion which follows, if cmd is a filesystem
path, it is first reduced to its rightmost component (the
file name).</p>

<p>Help is first sought by looking for a file named cmd in
the directory named by the HELPDIR parameter. If no file is
found, an assistant function, alias, or command named
run-help-cmd is sought. If found, the assistant is executed
with the rest of the current command line (everything after
the command name cmd) as its arguments. When neither file
nor assistant is found, the external command man cmd_is
run.</p>

<p>An example assistant for the &quot;ssh&quot;
command:</p>

<p>run-help-ssh() { emulate -LR zsh local -a args # Delete
the &quot;-l username&quot; option zparseopts -D -E -a args
l: # Delete other options, leaving: host command
args=(${@:#-*}) if [[ ${#args} -lt 2 ]]; then man ssh else
run-help $args[2] fi }</p>

<p>Several of these assistants are provided in the
Functions/Misc directory. These must be autoloaded, or
placed as executable scripts in your search path, in order
to be found and used by run-help.</p>

<p>run-help-git run-help-svk run-help-svn Assistant
functions for the git, svk, and svn commands.</p>

<p>tetris Zsh was once accused of not being as complete as
Emacs, because it lacked a Tetris game. This function was
written to refute this vicious slander.</p>

<p>This function must be used as a ZLE widget:</p>

<p>autoload -U tetris zle -N tetris bindkey keys tetris</p>

<p>To start a game, execute the widget by typing the keys.
What- ever command line you were editing disappears
temporarily, and your keymap is also temporarily replaced by
the Tetris control keys. The previous editor state is
restored when you quit the game (by pressing q) or when you
lose.</p>

<p>If you quit in the middle of a game, the next invocation
of the tetris widget will continue where you left off. If
you lost, it will start a new game.</p>

<p>zargs [ option ... -- ] [ input ... ] [ -- command [ arg
... ] ] This function works like GNU xargs, except that
instead of read- ing lines of arguments from the standard
input, it takes them from the command line. This is useful
because zsh, especially with recursive glob operators, often
can construct a command line for a shell function that is
longer than can be accepted by an external command.</p>

<p>The option list represents options of the zargs command
itself, which are the same as those of xargs. The input list
is the collection of strings (often file names) that become
the argu- ments of the command, analogous to the standard
input of xargs. Finally, the arg list consists of those
arguments (usually options) that are passed to the command
each time it runs. The arg list precedes the elements from
the input list in each run. If no command is provided, then
no arg list may be provided, and in that event the default
command is print with arguments -r --.</p>

<p>For example, to get a long ls listing of all plain files
in the current directory or its subdirectories:</p>

<p>autoload -U zargs zargs -- **/*(.) -- ls -l</p>

<p>Note that -- is used both to mark the end of the option
list and to mark the end of the input list, so it must
appear twice whenever the input list may be empty. If there
is guaranteed to be at least one input and the first input
does not begin with a -, then the first -- may be
omitted.</p>

<p>In the event that the string -- is or may be an input,
the -e option may be used to change the end-of-inputs
marker. Note that this does not change the end-of-options
marker. For exam- ple, to use .. as the marker:</p>

<p>zargs -e.. -- **/*(.) .. ls -l</p>

<p>This is a good choice in that example because no plain
file can be named .., but the best end-marker depends on the
circum- stances.</p>

<p>For details of the other zargs options, see xargs(1) or
run zargs with the --help option.</p>

<p>zed [ -f ] name zed -b This function uses the ZLE editor
to edit a file or function.</p>

<p>Only one name argument is allowed. If the -f option is
given, the name is taken to be that of a function; if the
function is marked for autoloading, zed searches for it in
the fpath and loads it. Note that functions edited this way
are installed into the current shell, but not written back
to the autoload file.</p>

<p>Without -f, name is the path name of the file to edit,
which need not exist; it is created on write, if
necessary.</p>

<p>While editing, the function sets the main keymap to zed
and the vi command keymap to zed-vicmd. These will be copied
from the existing main and vicmd keymaps if they do not
exist the first time zed is run. They can be used to provide
special key bind- ings used only in zed.</p>

<p>If it creates the keymap, zed rebinds the return key to
insert a line break and ^X^W to accept the edit in the zed
keymap, and binds ZZ to accept the edit in the zed-vicmd
keymap.</p>

<p>The bindings alone can be installed by running zed -b.
This is suitable for putting into a startup file. Note that,
if rerun, this will overwrite the existing zed and zed-vicmd
keymaps.</p>

<p>Completion is available, and styles may be set with the
context prefix :completion:zed.</p>

<p>A zle widget zed-set-file-name is available. This can be
called by name from within zed using ex zed-set-file-name
(note, however, that because of zeds rebindings you will
have to type ^j at the end instead of the return key), or
can be bound to a key in either of the zed or zed-vicmd
keymaps after zed -b has been run. When the widget is
called, it prompts for a new name for the file being edited.
When zed exits the file will be written under that name and
the original file will be left alone. The widget has no
effect with zed -f.</p>

<p>While zed-set-file-name is running, zed uses the keymap
zed-nor- mal-keymap, which is linked from the main keymap in
effect at the time zed initialised its bindings. (This is to
make the return key operate normally.) The result is that if
the main keymap has been changed, the widget won t notice.
This is not a concern for most users.</p>

<p>zcp [ -finqQvwW ] srcpat dest zln [ -finqQsvwW ] srcpat
dest Same as zmv -C and zmv -L, respectively. These
functions do not appear in the zsh distribution, but can be
created by linking zmv to the names zcp and zln in some
directory in your fpath.</p>

<p>zkbd See Keyboard Definition above.</p>

<p>zmv [ -finqQsvwW ] [ -C | -L | -M | -p program ] [ -o
optstring ] src- pat dest Move (usually, rename) files
matching the pattern srcpat to cor- responding files having
names of the form given by dest, where srcpat contains
parentheses surrounding patterns which will be replaced in
turn by $1, $2, ... in dest. For example,</p>

<p>zmv(*).li$1.txt</p>

<p>renames foo.lis to foo.txt , my.old.stuff.lis to
my.old.stuff.txt, and so on.</p>

<p>The pattern is always treated as an EXTENDED_GLOB
pattern. Any file whose name is not changed by the
substitution is simply ignored. Any error (a substitution
resulted in an empty string, two substitutions gave the same
result, the destination was an existing regular file and -f
was not given) causes the entire function to abort without
doing anything.</p>

<p>Options:</p>

<p>-f Force overwriting of destination files. Not currently
passed down to the mv/cp/ln command due to vagaries of
implementations (but you can use -o-f to do that). -i
Interactive: show each line to be executed and ask the user
whether to execute it. Y or y will execute it, anything else
will skip it. Note that you just need to type one character.
-n No execution: print what would happen, but dont do it. -q
Turn bare glob qualifiers off: now assumed by default, so
this has no effect. -Q Force bare glob qualifiers on. Dont
turn this on unless you are actually using glob qualifiers
in a pattern. -s Symbolic, passed down to ln; only works
with -L. -v Verbose: print each command as it s being
executed. -w Pick out wildcard parts of the pattern, as
described above, and implicitly add parentheses for
referring to them. -W Just like -w, with the addition of
turning wildcards in the replacement pattern into sequential
${1} .. ${N} ref- erences. -C -L -M Force cp, ln or mv,
respectively, regardless of the name of the function. -p
program Call program instead of cp, ln or mv. Whatever it
does, it should at least understand the form program -- old-
name newname where oldname and newname are filenames
generated by zmv. -o optstring The optstring is split into
words and passed down verba- tim to the cp, ln or mv command
called to perform the work. It should probably begin with a
-.</p>

<p>Further examples:</p>

<p>zmv -v(* *${1// /_}</p>

<p>For any file in the current directory with at least one
space in the name, replace every space by an underscore and
display the commands executed.</p>

<p>For more complete examples and other implementation
details, see the zmv source file, usually located in one of
the directories named in your fpath, or in
Functions/Misc/zmv in the zsh distri- bution.</p>

<p>zstyle+ context style value [ + subcontext style value
... ] This makes defining styles a bit simpler by using a
single + as a special token that allows you to append a
context name to the previously used context name. Like
this:</p>

<p>zstyle+ :foo:bar style1 value1 +:baz style2 value2
+:frob style3 value3</p>

<p>This defines style1 with value1 for the context :foo:bar
as usual, but it also defines style2 with value2 for the
con- text :foo:bar:baz and style3 with value3 for
:foo:bar:frob. Any subcontext may be the empty string to
re-use the first con- text unchanged.</p>

<p>Styles insert-tab The zed function sets this style in
context :completion:zed:* to turn off completion when TAB is
typed at the beginning of a line. You may override this by
setting your own value for this context and style.</p>

<p>pager The nslookup function looks up this style in the
context :nslookup to determine the program used to display
output that does not fit on a single screen.</p>

<p>prompt rprompt The nslookup function looks up this style
in the context :nslookup to set the prompt and the
right-side prompt, respec- tively. The usual expansions for
the PS1 and RPS1 parameters ZSHALL(1) ZSHALL(1)</p>

<p>may be used (see EXPANSION OF PROMPT SEQUENCES in
zshmisc(1)).</p>
