<p>DPMSSetTimeouts(3) X FUNCTIONS DPMSSetTimeouts(3)</p>

<p>NAME DPMSSetTimeouts - permits applications to set the
timeout values used by the X server for DPMS timings</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS cc [ flag ... ] file ... -lXext [ library ... ]
#include &lt;X11/extensions/dpms.h&gt;</p>

<p>Status DPMSSetTimeouts ( Display *display, CARD16
standby, CARD16 suspend, CARD16 off );</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS display Specifies the connection to the X
server</p>

<p>standby Specifies the new standby timeout in seconds</p>

<p>suspend Specifies the new suspend timeout in seconds</p>

<p>off Specifies the new off timeout in seconds</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The DPMSSetTimeouts function permits
applications to set the timeout values used by the X server
for Display Power Management Signaling (DPMS) timings.</p>

<p>The value standby is the amount of inactivity time, in
seconds, before standby mode is invoked. The actual effects
of this mode are dependent on the characteristics of the
monitor and frame buffer card. Standby mode is implemented
by shutting off the horizontal sync signal, and pulsing the
vertical sync signal. Standby mode provides the quickest
monitor recovery time. Note also that many monitors
implement this mode identical to suspend mode. A value of
zero disables the standby mode.</p>

<p>The value suspend is the amount of time of inactivity,
in seconds, before the second level of power savings is
invoked. Suspend modes physical and electrical
characteristics are implementation defined. For DPMS
compliant hardware, setting the suspend mode is implemented
by pulsing the horizontal sync signal and shutting off the
vertical sync signal. In general, suspend mode recovery is
considered to be slower than standby mode, but faster than
off mode. However it may vary from monitor to monitor. As
noted above, many monitors implement this mode identical to
the standby mode. A value of zero disables this mode.</p>

<p>The value off is the amount of time of inactivity,in
seconds, before the third and final level of power savings
is invoked. Off modes phys- ical and electrical
characteristics are implementation defined. In DPMS
compliant hardware, it is implemented by shutting off both
horizontal and vertical sync signals, resulting in powering
down of the monitor. Recovery time is implementation
dependent. Usually the recovery time is very close to the
power-up time of the monitor. A value of zero dis- ables
this mode.</p>

<p>Chronologically, standby mode occurs before or
simultaneously with suspend mode, and suspend mode must
occur before or simultaneously with off mode. Therefore,
non-zero mode timeout values must be greater than or equal
to the timeout values of earlier modes. If inconsistent val-
ues are supplied, a BadValue error will result.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUES TRUE The DPMSSetTimeouts function returns
TRUE when the func- tion has succeeded.</p>

<p>ERRORS BadValue An argument is out of range.</p>
