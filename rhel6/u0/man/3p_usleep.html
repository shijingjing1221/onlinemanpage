<p>USLEEP(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual USLEEP(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME usleep - suspend execution for an interval</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>int usleep(useconds_t useconds);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The usleep() function shall cause the
calling thread to be suspended from execution until either
the number of realtime microseconds speci- fied by the
argument useconds has elapsed or a signal is delivered to
the calling thread and its action is to invoke a
signal-catching func- tion or to terminate the process. The
suspension time may be longer than requested due to the
scheduling of other activity by the system.</p>

<p>The useconds argument shall be less than one million. If
the value of useconds is 0, then the call has no effect.</p>

<p>If a SIGALRM signal is generated for the calling process
during execu- tion of usleep() and if the SIGALRM signal is
being ignored or blocked from delivery, it is unspecified
whether usleep() returns when the SIGALRM signal is
scheduled. If the signal is being blocked, it is also
unspecified whether it remains pending after usleep()
returns or it is discarded.</p>

<p>If a SIGALRM signal is generated for the calling process
during execu- tion of usleep(), except as a result of a
prior call to alarm(), and if the SIGALRM signal is not
being ignored or blocked from delivery, it is unspecified
whether that signal has any effect other than causing
usleep() to return.</p>

<p>If a signal-catching function interrupts usleep() and
examines or changes either the time a SIGALRM is scheduled
to be generated, the action associated with the SIGALRM
signal, or whether the SIGALRM sig- nal is blocked from
delivery, the results are unspecified.</p>

<p>If a signal-catching function interrupts usleep() and
calls sig- longjmp() or longjmp() to restore an environment
saved prior to the usleep() call, the action associated with
the SIGALRM signal and the time at which a SIGALRM signal is
scheduled to be generated are unspec- ified. It is also
unspecified whether the SIGALRM signal is blocked, unless
the process signal mask is restored as part of the
environment.</p>

<p>Implementations may place limitations on the granularity
of timer val- ues. For each interval timer, if the requested
timer value requires a finer granularity than the
implementation supports, the actual timer value shall be
rounded up to the next supported value.</p>

<p>Interactions between usleep() and any of the following
are unspecified:</p>

<p>nanosleep() setitimer() timer_create() timer_delete()
timer_getoverrun() timer_gettime() timer_settime() ualarm()
sleep()</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, usleep() shall
return 0; otherwise, it shall return -1 and set errno to
indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The usleep() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The time interval specified one million or more
microseconds.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE Applications are recommended to use
nanosleep() if the Timers option is supported, or
setitimer(), timer_create(), timer_delete(),
timer_getoverrun(), timer_gettime(), or timer_settime()
instead of this function.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
