<p>NAME rpc.gssd - rpcsec_gss daemon</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rpc.gssd [-f] [-n] [-k keytab] [-p pipefsdir]
[-v] [-r] [-d ccachedir]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The rpcsec_gss protocol gives a means of
using the gss-api generic security api to provide security
for protocols using rpc (in particu- lar, nfs). Before
exchanging any rpc requests using rpcsec_gss, the rpc client
must first establish a security context. The linux kernels
implementation of rpcsec_gss depends on the userspace daemon
rpc.gssd to establish security contexts. The rpc.gssd daemon
uses files in the rpc_pipefs filesystem to communicate with
the kernel.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -f Runs rpc.gssd in the foreground and sends
output to stderr (as opposed to syslogd)</p>

<p>-n By default, rpc.gssd treats accesses by the user with
UID 0 spe- cially, and uses &quot;machine credentials&quot;
for all accesses by that user which require Kerberos
authentication. With the -n option, &quot;machine
credentials&quot; will not be used for accesses by UID 0.
Instead, credentials must be obtained manually like all
other users. Use of this option means that &quot;root&quot;
must manually obtain Kerberos credentials before attempting
to mount an nfs filesystem requiring Kerberos
authentication.</p>

<p>-k keytab Tells rpc.gssd to use the keys found in keytab
to obtain &quot;machine credentials&quot;. The default value
is &quot;/etc/krb5.keytab&quot;.</p>

<p>Previous versions of rpc.gssd used only
&quot;nfs/*&quot; keys found within the keytab. To be more
consistent with other implementa- tions, we now look for
specific keytab entries. The search order for keytabs to be
used for &quot;machine credentials&quot; is now:
root/&lt;hostname&gt;@&lt;REALM&gt;
nfs/&lt;hostname&gt;@&lt;REALM&gt;
host/&lt;hostname&gt;@&lt;REALM&gt;
root/&lt;anyname&gt;@&lt;REALM&gt;
nfs/&lt;anyname&gt;@&lt;REALM&gt;
host/&lt;anyname&gt;@&lt;REALM&gt;</p>

<p>-p path Tells rpc.gssd where to look for the rpc_pipefs
filesystem. The default value is
&quot;/var/lib/nfs/rpc_pipefs&quot;.</p>

<p>-d directory Tells rpc.gssd where to look for Kerberos
credential files. The default value is &quot;/tmp&quot;.
This can also be a colon separated list of directories to be
searched for Kerberos credential files. Note that if machine
credentials are being stored in files, then the first
directory on this list is where the machine credentials are
stored.</p>

<p>-v Increases the verbosity of the output (can be
specified multiple times).</p>

<p>-r If the rpcsec_gss library supports setting debug
level, increases the verbosity of the output (can be
specified multiple times).</p>

<p>-R realm Kerberos tickets from this realm will be
preferred when scanning available credentials cache files to
be used to create a con- text. By default, the default
realm, as configured in the Ker- beros configuration file,
is preferred.</p>

<p>-t timeout Timeout, in seconds, for kernel gss contexts.
This option allows you to force new kernel contexts to be
negotiated after timeout seconds, which allows changing
Kerberos tickets and identities frequently. The default is
no explicit timeout, which means the kernel context will
live the lifetime of the Kerberos service ticket used in its
creation.</p>
