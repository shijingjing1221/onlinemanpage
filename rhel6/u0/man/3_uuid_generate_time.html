<p>UUID_GENERATE(3) Libuuid API UUID_GENERATE(3)</p>

<p>NAME uuid_generate, uuid_generate_random,
uuid_generate_time - create a new unique UUID value</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;uuid/uuid.h&gt;</p>

<p>void uuid_generate(uuid_t out); void
uuid_generate_random(uuid_t out); void
uuid_generate_time(uuid_t out);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The uuid_generate function creates a new
universally unique identifier (UUID). The uuid will be
generated based on high-quality randomness from
/dev/urandom, if available. If it is not available, then
uuid_generate will use an alternative algorithm which uses
the current time, the local ethernet MAC address (if
available), and random data generated using a pseudo-random
generator.</p>

<p>The uuid_generate_random function forces the use of the
all-random UUID format, even if a high-quality random number
generator (i.e., /dev/urandom) is not available, in which
case a pseudo-random generator will be subsituted. Note that
the use of a pseudo-random generator may compromise the
uniqueness of UUID s generated in this fashion.</p>

<p>The uuid_generate_time function forces the use of the
alternative algo- rithm which uses the current time and the
local ethernet MAC address (if available). This algorithm
used to be the default one used to gen- erate UUID, but
because of the use of the ethernet MAC address, it can leak
information about when and where the UUID was generated.
This can cause privacy problems in some applications, so the
uuid_generate func- tion only uses this algorithm if a
high-quality source of randomness is not available.</p>

<p>The UUID is 16 bytes (128 bits) long, which gives
approximately 3.4x10^38 unique values (there are
approximately 10^80 elemntary parti- cles in the universe
according to Carl Sagan s Cosmos). The new UUID can
reasonably be considered unique among all UUIDs created on
the local system, and among UUIDs created on other systems
in the past and in the future.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The newly created UUID is returned in the
memory location pointed to by out.</p>
