<p>GETSOCKNAME(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
GETSOCKNAME(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME getsockname - get the socket name</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;</p>

<p>int getsockname(int socket, struct sockaddr *restrict
address, socklen_t *restrict address_len);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The getsockname() function shall retrieve
the locally-bound name of the specified socket, store this
address in the sockaddr structure pointed to by the address
argument, and store the length of this address in the object
pointed to by the address_len argument.</p>

<p>If the actual length of the address is greater than the
length of the supplied sockaddr structure, the stored
address shall be truncated.</p>

<p>If the socket has not been bound to a local name, the
value stored in the object pointed to by address is
unspecified.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, 0 shall be
returned, the address argument shall point to the address of
the socket, and the address_len argument shall point to the
length of the address. Otherwise, -1 shall be returned and
errno set to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The getsockname() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EBADF The socket argument is not a valid file
descriptor.</p>

<p>ENOTSOCK The socket argument does not refer to a
socket.</p>

<p>EOPNOTSUPP The operation is not supported for this
socket s protocol.</p>

<p>The getsockname() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The socket has been shut down.</p>

<p>ENOBUFS Insufficient resources were available in the
system to complete the function.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>
