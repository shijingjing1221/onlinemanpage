<p>NAME XmParseMapping Data type for a compound string
parse mapping</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;Xm/Xm.h&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION XmParseMapping is an opaque data type for a
parse mapping used by XmStringParseText to create a compound
string. A parse mapping con- tains a pattern to be matched
in text being parsed to create a compound string. It also
contains a compound string, or a function to be invoked to
provide a compound string, to be included in the compound
string being created whenever the pattern is matched.</p>

<p>An application uses a resource-style interface to
specify components for an XmParseMapping.
XmParseMappingCreate creates a parse mapping, using a
resource-style argument list. XmParseMappingGetValues and
XmParseMappingSetValues retrieve and set the components of a
parse map- ping. XmParseMappingFree recovers memory used by
a parse mapping. XmParseTable is an array of XmParseMapping
objects.</p>

<p>The XmNinvokeParseProc resource is a function of type
XmParseProc, which is defined as follows:</p>

<p>XmIncludeStatus (*XmParseProc) (text_in_out, text_end,
type, tag, entry, pattern_length, str_include, call_data)
XtPointer *text_in_out; XtPointer text_end; XmTextType type;
XmStringTag tag; XmParseMapping entry; int pattern_length;
XmString *str_include; XtPointer call_data;</p>

<p>A parse procedure provides an escape mechanism for
arbitrarily complex parsing. This procedure is invoked when
a pattern in the input text is matched with a pattern in a
parse mapping whose XmNincludeStatus is XmINVOKE.</p>

<p>The input text is a pointer to the first byte of the
pattern that was matched to trigger the call to the parse
procedure. The parse proce- dure consumes as many bytes of
the input string as it needs and sets the input text pointer
to the following byte. It returns a compound string to be
included in the compound string being constructed, and it
also returns an XmIncludeStatus indicating how the returned
compound string should be handled. If the parse procedure
does not set the input text pointer ahead by at least one
byte, the parsing routine con- tinues trying to match the
input text with the patterns in the remain- ing parse
mappings in the parse table. Otherwise, the parsing routine
begins with the new input text pointer and tries to match
the input text with patterns in the parse mappings starting
at the beginning of the parse table.</p>

<p>text_in_out Specifies the text being parsed. The value
is a pointer to the first byte of text matching the pattern
that triggered the call to the parse procedure. When the
parse procedure returns, this argument is set to the
position in the text where parsing should resumethat is, to
the byte following the last character parsed by the parse
procedure.</p>

<p>text_end Specifies a pointer to the end of the
text_in_out string. If text_end is NULL, the string is
scanned until a NULL charac- ter is found. Otherwise, the
string is scanned up to but not including the character
whose address is text_end.</p>

<p>type Specifies the type of text and the tag type. If a
locale tag should be created, type has a value of either
XmMULTI- BYTE_TEXT or XmWIDECHAR_TEXT. If a charset should
be cre- ated, type has a value of XmCHARSET_TEXT.</p>

<p>tag Specifies the tag to be used in creating the result.
The type of string tag created (charset or locale) depends
on the text type and the passed in tag value. If the tag
value is NULL and if type indicates that a charset string
tag should be created, the string tag has the value that is
the result of mapping XmSTRING_DEFAULT_CHARSET. If type
indicates a locale string tag, the string tag has the value
_MOTIF_DEFAULT_LOCALE.</p>

<p>entry Specifies the parse mapping that triggered the
call to the parse procedure.</p>

<p>pattern_length Specifies the number of bytes in the
input text, following text_in_out, that constitute the
matched pattern.</p>

<p>str_include Specifies a pointer to a compound string.
The parse proce- dure creates a compound string to be
included in the compound string being constructed. The parse
procedure then returns the compound string in this
argument.</p>

<p>call_data Specifies data passed by the application to
the parsing rou- tine.</p>

<p>The parse procedure returns an XmIncludeStatus
indicating how str_include is to be included in the compound
string being constructed. Following are the possible
values:</p>

<p>XmINSERT Concatenate the result to the compound string
being con- structed and continue parsing.</p>

<p>XmTERMINATE Concatenate the result to the compound
string being con- structed and terminate parsing.</p>

<p>New Resources The following table defines a set of
resources used by the programmer to specify data. The codes
in the access column indicate if the given resource can be
set at creation time (C), set by using XmParseMap-
pingSetValues (S), retrieved by using
XmParseMappingGetValues (G), or is not applicable (N/A).</p>

XmNclientData Specifies data to be used by the parse
procedure.</p>

<p>XmNincludeStatus Specifies how the result of the mapping
is to be included in the compound string being constructed.
Unless the value is XmINVOKE, the result of the mapping is
the value of XmNsub- stitute. Following are the possible
values for XmNinclud- eStatus:</p>

<p>XmINSERT Concatenate the result to the compound string
being constructed and continue parsing.</p>

<p>XmINVOKE Invoke the XmNinvokeParseProc on the text being
parsed and use the returned compound string instead of
XmNsubstitute as the result to be inserted into the compound
string being constructed. The include status returned by the
parse procedure (XmINSERT or XmTERMINATE) determines how the
returned compound string is included.</p>

<p>XmTERMINATE Concatenate the result to the compound
string being constructed and terminate parsing.</p>

<p>XmNinvokeParseProc Specifies the parse procedure to be
invoked when XmNinclud- eStatus is XmINVOKE.</p>

<p>XmNpattern Specifies a pattern to be matched in the text
being parsed. This is a maximum of one character.</p>

<p>XmNpatternType Specifies the type of the pattern that is
the value of XmN- pattern. Following are the possible
values:</p>

<p>&middot; XmCHARSET_TEXT</p>

<p>&middot; XmMULTIBYTE_TEXT</p>

<p>&middot; XmWIDECHAR_TEXT</p>

<p>XmNsubstitute Specifies the compound string to be
included in the compound string being constructed when
XmNincludeStatus is XmINSERT or XmTERMINATE.</p>
