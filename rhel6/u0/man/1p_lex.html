<p>LEX(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual LEX(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME lex - generate programs for lexical tasks
(DEVELOPMENT)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS lex [-t][-n|-v][file ...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The lex utility shall generate C programs to
be used in lexical pro- cessing of character input, and that
can be used as an interface to yacc. The C programs shall be
generated from lex source code and con- form to the ISO C
standard. Usually, the lex utility shall write the program
it generates to the file lex.yy.c; the state of this file is
unspecified if lex exits with a non-zero exit status. See
the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section for a complete description
of the lex input lan- guage.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The lex utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>The following options shall be supported:</p>

<p>-n Suppress the summary of statistics usually written
with the -v option. If no table sizes are specified in the
lex source code and the -v option is not specified, then -n
is implied.</p>

<p>-t Write the resulting program to standard output
instead of lex.yy.c.</p>

<p>-v Write a summary of lex statistics to the standard
output. (See the discussion of lex table sizes in
Definitions in lex .) If the -t option is specified and -n
is not specified, this report shall be written to standard
error. If table sizes are specified in the lex source code,
and if the -n option is not specified, the -v option may be
enabled.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p>file A pathname of an input file. If more than one such
file is spec- ified, all files shall be concatenated to
produce a single lex program. If no file operands are
specified, or if a file operand is, the standard input shall
be used.</p>

<p>STDIN The standard input shall be used if no file
operands are specified, or if a file operand is-. See INPUT
FILES.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES The input files shall be text files
containing lex source code, as described in the EXTENDED
DESCRIPTION section.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of lex:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_COLLATE</p>

<p>Determine the locale for the behavior of ranges,
equivalence classes, and multi-character collating elements
within regular expressions. If this variable is not set to
the POSIX locale, the results are unspecified.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments
and input files), and the behavior of character classes
within regular expres- sions. If this variable is not set to
the POSIX locale, the results are unspecified.</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT If the -t option is specified, the text file of C
source code output of lex shall be written to standard
output.</p>

<p>If the -t option is not specified:</p>

<p>* Implementation-defined informational, error, and
warning messages concerning the contents of lex source code
input shall be written to either the standard output or
standard error.</p>

<p>* If the -v option is specified and the -n option is not
specified, lex statistics shall also be written to either
the standard output or standard error, in an
implementation-defined format. These statistics may also be
generated if table sizes are specified with a %operator in
the Definitions section, as long as the -n option is not
specified.</p>

<p>STDERR If the -t option is specified,
implementation-defined informational, error, and warning
messages concerning the contents of lex source code input
shall be written to the standard error.</p>

<p>If the -t option is not specified:</p>

<p>1. Implementation-defined informational, error, and
warning messages concerning the contents of lex source code
input shall be written to either the standard output or
standard error.</p>

<p>2. If the -v option is specified and the -n option is
not specified, lex statistics shall also be written to
either the standard output or standard error, in an
implementation-defined format. These statistics may also be
generated if table sizes are specified with a %operator in
the Definitions section, as long as the -n option is not
specified.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES A text file containing C source code shall
be written to lex.yy.c, or to the standard output if the -t
option is present.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION Each input file shall contain lex
source code, which is a table of reg- ular expressions with
corresponding actions in the form of C program
fragments.</p>

<p>When lex.yy.c is compiled and linked with the lex
library (using the -l l operand with c99), the resulting
program shall read character input from the standard input
and shall partition it into strings that match the given
expressions.</p>

<p>When an expression is matched, these actions shall
occur:</p>

<p>* The input string that was matched shall be left in
yytext as a null- terminated string; yytext shall either be
an external character array or a pointer to a character
string. As explained in Defini- tions in lex, the type can
be explicitly selected using the %array or %pointer
declarations, but the default is implementation-defined.</p>

<p>* The external int yyleng shall be set to the length of
the matching string.</p>

<p>* The expression s corresponding program fragment, or
action, shall be executed.</p>

<p>During pattern matching, lex shall search the set of
patterns for the single longest possible match. Among rules
that match the same number of characters, the rule given
first shall be chosen.</p>

<p>The general format of lex source shall be:</p>

<p>Definitions %% Rules %% UserSubroutines</p>

<p>The first &quot;%%&quot; is required to mark the
beginning of the rules (regular expressions and actions);
the second &quot;%%&quot; is required only if user sub-
routines follow.</p>

<p>Any line in the Definitions section beginning with a
&lt;blank&gt; shall be assumed to be a C program fragment
and shall be copied to the external definition area of the
lex.yy.c file. Similarly, anything in the Defi- nitions
section included between delimiter lines containing only
&quot;%{&quot; and &quot;%}&quot; shall also be copied
unchanged to the external definition area of the lex.yy.c
file.</p>

<p>Any such input (beginning with a &lt;blank&gt; or within
&quot;%{&quot; and &quot;%}&quot; delim- iter lines)
appearing at the beginning of the Rules section before any
rules are specified shall be written to lex.yy.c after the
declarations of variables for the yylex() function and
before the first line of code in yylex(). Thus, user
variables local to yylex() can be declared here, as well as
application code to execute upon entry to yylex().</p>

<p>The action taken by lex when encountering any input
beginning with a &lt;blank&gt; or within &quot;%{&quot; and
&quot;%}&quot; delimiter lines appearing in the Rules
section but coming after one or more rules is undefined. The
presence of such input may result in an erroneous definition
of the yylex() function.</p>

<p>Definitions in lex Definitions appear before the first
&quot;%%&quot; delimiter. Any line in this section not
contained between &quot;%{&quot; and &quot;%}&quot; lines
and not beginning with a &lt;blank&gt; shall be assumed to
define a lex substitution string. The format of these lines
shall be:</p>

<p>name substitute</p>

<p>If a name does not meet the requirements for identifiers
in the ISO C standard, the result is undefined. The string
substitute shall replace the string { name} when it is used
in a rule. The name string shall be recognized in this
context only when the braces are provided and when it does
not appear within a bracket expression or within
double-quotes.</p>

<p>In the Definitions section, any line beginning with a %
(percent sign) character and followed by an alphanumeric
word beginning with eithersorSshall define a set of start
conditions. Any line beginning with a %followed by a word
beginning with eitherxor Xshall define a set of exclusive
start conditions. When the gener- ated scanner is in a %s
state, patterns with no state specified shall be also
active; in a %x state, such patterns shall not be active.
The rest of the line, after the first word, shall be
considered to be one or more &lt;blank&gt;-separated names
of start conditions. Start condition names shall be
constructed in the same way as definition names. Start
conditions can be used to restrict the matching of regular
expressions to one or more states as described in Regular
Expressions in lex .</p>

<p>Implementations shall accept either of the following two
mutually- exclusive declarations in the Definitions
section:</p>

<p>%array Declare the type of yytext to be a
null-terminated character array.</p>

<p>%pointer Declare the type of yytext to be a pointer to a
null-terminated character string.</p>

<p>The default type of yytext is implementation-defined. If
an application refers to yytext outside of the scanner
source file (that is, via an extern), the application shall
include the appropriate %array or %pointer declaration in
the scanner source file.</p>

<p>Implementations shall accept declarations in the
Definitions section for setting certain internal table
sizes. The declarations are shown in the following
table.</p>

<p>Table: Table Size Declarations in lex</p>

<p>Declaration Description Minimum Value %p n Number of
positions 2500 %n n Number of states 500 %a n Number of
transitions 2000 %e n Number of parse tree nodes 1000 %k n
Number of packed character classes 1000 %o n Size of the
output array 3000</p>

<p>In the table, n represents a positive decimal integer,
preceded by one or more &lt;blank&gt;s. The exact meaning of
these table size numbers is implementation-defined. The
implementation shall document how these numbers affect the
lex utility and how they are related to any output that may
be generated by the implementation should limitations be
encountered during the execution of lex. It shall be
possible to deter- mine from this output which of the table
size values needs to be modi- fied to permit lex to
successfully generate tables for the input lan- guage. The
values in the column Minimum Value represent the lowest
values conforming implementations shall provide.</p>

<p>Rules in lex The rules in lex source files are a table
in which the left column con- tains regular expressions and
the right column contains actions (C pro- gram fragments) to
be executed when the expressions are recognized.</p>

<p>ERE action ERE action...</p>

<p>The extended regular expression (ERE) portion of a row
shall be sepa- rated from action by one or more
&lt;blank&gt;s. A regular expression con- taining
&lt;blank&gt;s shall be recognized under one of the
following condi- tions:</p>

<p>* The entire expression appears within
double-quotes.</p>

<p>* The &lt;blank&gt;s appear within double-quotes or
square brackets.</p>

<p>* Each &lt;blank&gt; is preceded by a backslash
character.</p>

<p>User Subroutines in lex Anything in the user subroutines
section shall be copied to lex.yy.c following yylex().</p>

<p>Regular Expressions in lex The lex utility shall support
the set of extended regular expressions (see the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 9.4,
Extended Regular Expressions), with the following additions
and excep- tions to the syntax:</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot; Any string enclosed in double-quotes
shall represent the charac- ters within the double-quotes as
themselves, except that back- slash escapes (which appear in
the following table) shall be recognized. Any
backslash-escape sequence shall be terminated by the closing
quote. For example, 01&quot; &quot;1&quot; represents a
single string: the octal value 1 followed by the character1
.</p>

<p>&lt;state&gt;r, &lt;state1,state2,...&gt;r</p>

<p>The regular expression r shall be matched only when the
program is in one of the start conditions indicated by
state, state1, and so on; see Actions in lex . (As an
exception to the typo- graphical conventions of the rest of
this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, in this case
&lt;state&gt; does not represent a metavariable, but the
literal angle-bracket characters surround- ing a symbol.)
The start condition shall be recognized as such only at the
beginning of a regular expression.</p>

<p>r/x The regular expression r shall be matched only if it
is followed by an occurrence of regular expression x ( x is
the instance of trailing context, further defined below).
The token returned in yytext shall only match r. If the
trailing portion of r matches the beginning of x, the result
is unspecified. The r expression cannot include further
trailing context or the $ (match-end- of-line) operator; x
cannot include the ^ (match-beginning-of- line) operator,
nor trailing context, nor the$ operator. That is, only one
occurrence of trailing context is allowed in a lex regular
expression, and the^operator only can be used at the
beginning of such an expression.</p>

<p>{name} When name is one of the substitution symbols from
the Defini- tions section, the string, including the
enclosing braces, shall be replaced by the substitute value.
The substitute value shall be treated in the extended
regular expression as if it were enclosed in parentheses. No
substitution shall occur if { name} occurs within a bracket
expression or within double-quotes.</p>

<p>Within an ERE, a backslash character shall be considered
to begin an escape sequence as specified in the table in the
Base Definitions vol- ume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Chapter
5, File Format Notation (,). In addition, the escape ,b,,,
sequences in the following table shall be recognized.</p>

<p>A literal &lt;newline&gt; cannot occur within an ERE;
the escape sequence n can be used to represent a
&lt;newline&gt;. A &lt;newline&gt; shall not be matched by a
period operator.</p>

<p>Table: Escape Sequences in lex</p>

<p>Escape Sequence Description Meaning digits A backslash
character followed The character whose encoding by the
longest sequence of is represented by the one, one, two, or
three octal-digit two, or three-digit octal characters
(01234567). If all integer. If the size of a byte of the
digits are 0 (that is, on the system is greater than
representation of the NUL nine bits, the valid escape
character), the behavior is sequence used to represent a
undefined. byte is implementation- defined. Multi-byte
characters require multiple, concatenated escape sequences
of this type, including the leadinfor each byte. xdigits A
backslash character followed The character whose encoding by
the longest sequence of is represented by the hexadec-
hexadecimal-digit characters imal integer.
(01234567abcdefABCDEF). If all of the digits are 0 (that is,
representation of the NUL character), the behavior is
undefined. c A backslash character followed The character,
unchanged. by any character not described in this table or
in the table in the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001, Chap- ter 5, File Format Notation ( b,).</p>

<p>Note: If sequence needs to be immediately followed by a
hex- adecimal digit character, a sequence such as 1&quot;
&quot;1&quot; can be used, which represents a character
containing the value 1, fol- lowed by the character1.</p>

<p>The order of precedence given to extended regular
expressions for lex differs from that specified in the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 9.4,
Extended Regular Expressions. The order of precedence for
lex shall be as shown in the following table, from high to
low.</p>

<p>Note: The escaped characters entry is not meant to imply
that these are operators, but they are included in the table
to show their relationships to the true operators. The start
condition, trail- ing context, and anchoring notations have
been omitted from the table because of the placement
restrictions described in this section; they can only appear
at the beginning or ending of an ERE.</p>

<p>Table: ERE Precedence in lex</p>

<p>Extended Regular Expression Precedence collation-related
bracket symbols [= =] [: :] [. .] escaped characters
&lt;special character&gt; bracket expression [ ] quoting
&quot;...&quot; grouping ( ) definition {name}
single-character RE duplication * + ? concatenation interval
expression {m,n} alternation |</p>

<p>The ERE anchoring operators ^and$do not appear in the
table. With lex regular expressions, these operators are
restricted in their use: the ^ operator can only be used at
the beginning of an entire regular expression, and
the$operator only at the end. The operators apply to the
entire regular expression. Thus, for example, the pattern
&quot;(^abc)|(def$)&quot; is undefined; it can instead be
written as two separate rules, one with the regular
expression &quot;^abc&quot; and one with &quot;def$&quot;,
which share a common action via the special| action (see
below). If the pattern were written &quot;^abc|def$&quot;,
it would match either &quot;abc&quot; or &quot;def&quot; on
a line by itself.</p>

<p>Unlike the general ERE rules, embedded anchoring is not
allowed by most historical lex implementations. An example
of embedded anchoring would be for patterns such as
&quot;(^| )foo( |$)&quot; to match &quot;foo&quot; when it
exists as a complete word. This functionality can be
obtained using existing lex features:</p>

<p>^foo/[n] | &quot; foo&quot;/[n] /* Found foo as a
separate word. */</p>

<p>Note also that$is a form of trailing context (it is
equivalent to &quot;n&quot; ) and as such cannot be used
with regular expressions containing another instance of the
operator (see the preceding discussion of trailing
context).</p>

<p>The additional regular expressions trailing-context
operator/can be used as an ordinary character if presented
within double-quotes, &quot;/&quot; ; preceded by a
backslash, /&quot; ; or within a bracket expression,
&quot;[/]&quot; . The start-condition&lt;and&gt;operators
shall be special only in a start condition at the beginning
of a regular expression; elsewhere in the regular expression
they shall be treated as ordinary characters.</p>

<p>Actions in lex The action to be taken when an ERE is
matched can be a C program frag- ment or the special actions
described below; the program fragment can contain one or
more C statements, and can also include special actions. The
empty C statement;shall be a valid action; any string in the
lex.yy.c input that matches the pattern portion of such a
rule is effectively ignored or skipped. However, the absence
of an action shall not be valid, and the action lex takes in
such a condition is unde- fined.</p>

<p>The specification for an action, including C statements
and special actions, can extend across several lines if
enclosed in braces:</p>

<p>ERE &lt;one or more blanks&gt; { program statement
program statement }</p>

<p>The default action when a string in the input to a
lex.yy.c program is not matched by any expression shall be
to copy the string to the out- put. Because the default
behavior of a program generated by lex is to read the input
and copy it to the output, a minimal lex source program that
has just &quot;%%&quot; shall generate a C program that
simply copies the input to the output unchanged.</p>

<p>Four special actions shall be available:</p>

<p>| ECHO; REJECT; BEGIN</p>

<p>| The action | means that the action for the next rule
is the action for this rule. Unlike the other three
actions,|cannot be enclosed in braces or be
semicolon-terminated; the applica- tion shall ensure that it
is specified alone, with no other actions.</p>

<p>ECHO; Write the contents of the string yytext on the
output.</p>

<p>REJECT; Usually only a single expression is matched by a
given string in the input. REJECT means &quot;continue to
the next expression that matches the current input&quot;,
and shall cause whatever rule was the second choice after
the current rule to be executed for the same input. Thus,
multiple rules can be matched and executed for one input
string or overlapping input strings. For example, given the
regular expressions &quot;xyz&quot; and &quot;xy&quot; and
the input &quot;xyz&quot;, usually only the regular
expression &quot;xyz&quot; would match. The next attempted
match would start after z. If the last action in the
&quot;xyz&quot; rule is REJECT, both this rule and the
&quot;xy&quot; rule would be executed. The REJECT action may
be implemented in such a fashion that flow of control does
not continue after it, as if it were equivalent to a goto to
another part of yylex(). The use of REJECT may result in
somewhat larger and slower scanners.</p>

<p>BEGIN The action:</p>

<p>BEGIN newstate;</p>

<p>switches the state (start condition) to newstate. If the
string new- state has not been declared previously as a
start condition in the Def- initions section, the results
are unspecified. The initial state is indicated by the
digit0or the token INITIAL.</p>

<p>The functions or macros described below are accessible
to user code included in the lex input. It is unspecified
whether they appear in the C code output of lex, or are
accessible only through the -l l operand to c99 (the lex
library).</p>

<p>int yylex(void)</p>

<p>Performs lexical analysis on the input; this is the
primary function generated by the lex utility. The function
shall return zero when the end of input is reached;
otherwise, it shall return non-zero values (tokens)
determined by the actions that are selected.</p>

<p>int yymore(void)</p>

<p>When called, indicates that when the next input string
is recog- nized, it is to be appended to the current value
of yytext rather than replacing it; the value in yyleng
shall be adjusted accordingly.</p>

<p>int yyless(int n)</p>

<p>Retains n initial characters in yytext, NUL-terminated,
and treats the remaining characters as if they had not been
read; the value in yyleng shall be adjusted accordingly.</p>

<p>int input(void)</p>

<p>Returns the next character from the input, or zero on
end-of- file. It shall obtain input from the stream pointer
yyin, although possibly via an intermediate buffer. Thus,
once scan- ning has begun, the effect of altering the value
of yyin is undefined. The character read shall be removed
from the input stream of the scanner without any processing
by the scanner.</p>

<p>int unput(int c)</p>

<p>Returns the charactercto the input; yytext and yyleng
are undefined until the next expression is matched. The
result of using unput() for more characters than have been
input is unspecified.</p>

<p>The following functions shall appear only in the lex
library accessible through the -l l operand; they can
therefore be redefined by a conform- ing application:</p>

<p>int yywrap(void)</p>

<p>Called by yylex() at end-of-file; the default yywrap()
shall always return 1. If the application requires yylex()
to continue processing with another source of input, then
the application can include a function yywrap(), which
associates another file with the external variable FILE *
yyin and shall return a value of zero.</p>

<p>int main(int argc, char *argv[])</p>

<p>Calls yylex() to perform lexical analysis, then exits.
The user code can contain main() to perform
application-specific opera- tions, calling yylex() as
applicable.</p>

<p>Except for input(), unput(), and main(), all external
and static names generated by lex shall begin with the
prefix yy or YY.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 Successful completion.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE Conforming applications are warned
that in the Rules section, an ERE without an action is not
acceptable, but need not be detected as erro- neous by lex.
This may result in compilation or runtime errors.</p>

<p>The purpose of input() is to take characters off the
input stream and discard them as far as the lexical analysis
is concerned. A common use is to discard the body of a
comment once the beginning of a comment is recognized.</p>

<p>The lex utility is not fully internationalized in its
treatment of reg- ular expressions in the lex source code or
generated lexical analyzer. It would seem desirable to have
the lexical analyzer interpret the reg- ular expressions
given in the lex source according to the environment
specified when the lexical analyzer is executed, but this is
not possi- ble with the current lex technology. Furthermore,
the very nature of the lexical analyzers produced by lex
must be closely tied to the lexi- cal requirements of the
input language being described, which is fre- quently
locale-specific anyway. (For example, writing an analyzer
that is used for French text is not automatically useful for
processing other languages.)</p>

<p>EXAMPLES The following is an example of a lex program
that implements a rudimen- tary scanner for a Pascal-like
syntax:</p>

<p>%{ /* Need this for the call to atof() below. */
#include &lt;math.h&gt; /* Need this for printf(), fopen(),
and stdin below. */ #include &lt;stdio.h&gt; %}</p>

<p>DIGIT [0-9] ID [a-z][a-z0-9]*</p>

<p>%%</p>

<p>{DIGIT}+ { printf(&quot;An integer: %s (%dn&quot;,
yytext, atoi(yytext)); }</p>

<p>{DIGIT}+&quot;.&quot;{DIGIT}* { printf(&quot;A float: %s
(%gn&quot;, yytext, atof(yytext)); }</p>

<p>if|then|begin|end|procedure|function { printf(&quot;A
keyword: %n&quot;, yytext); }</p>

<p>{ID} printf(&quot;An identifier: %n&quot;, yytext);</p>

<p>&quot;+&quot;|&quot;-&quot;|&quot;*&quot;|&quot;/&quot;
printf(&quot;An operator: %n&quot;, yytext);</p>

<p>&quot;{&quot;[^n]*&quot;}&quot; /* Eat up one-line
comments. */</p>

<p>n]+ /* Eat up white space. */</p>

<p>. printf(&quot;Unrecognized character: %n&quot;,
yytext);</p>

<p>%%</p>

<p>int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { ++argv, --argc; /*
Skip over program name. */ if (argc &gt; 0) yyin =
fopen(argv[0], &quot;r&quot;); else yyin = stdin;</p>

<p>yylex(); }</p>

<p>RATIONALE Even though the -c option and references to
the C language are retained in this description, lex may be
generalized to other languages, as was done at one time for
EFL, the Extended FORTRAN Language. Since the lex input
specification is essentially language-independent, versions
of this utility could be written to produce Ada, Modula-2,
or Pascal code, and there are known historical
implementations that do so.</p>

<p>The current description of lex bypasses the issue of
dealing with internationalized EREs in the lex source code
or generated lexical ana- lyzer. If it follows the model
used by awk (the source code is assumed to be presented in
the POSIX locale, but input and output are in the locale
specified by the environment variables), then the tables in
the lexical analyzer produced by lex would interpret EREs
specified in the lex source in terms of the environment
variables specified when lex was executed. The desired
effect would be to have the lexical analyzer interpret the
EREs given in the lex source according to the environment
specified when the lexical analyzer is executed, but this is
not possi- ble with the current lex technology.</p>

<p>The description of octal and hexadecimal-digit escape
sequences agrees with the ISO C standard use of escape
sequences. See the RATIONALE for ed for a discussion of
bytes larger than 9 bits being represented by octal values.
Hexadecimal values can represent larger bytes and multi-
byte characters directly, using as many digits as
required.</p>

<p>There is no detailed output format specification. The
observed behavior of lex under four different historical
implementations was that none of these implementations
consistently reported the line numbers for error and warning
messages. Furthermore, there was a desire that lex be
allowed to output additional diagnostic messages. Leaving
message for- mats unspecified avoids these formatting
questions and problems with internationalization.</p>

<p>Although the %x specifier for exclusive start conditions
is not histor- ical practice, it is believed to be a minor
change to historical imple- mentations and greatly enhances
the usability of lex programs since it permits an
application to obtain the expected functionality with fewer
statements.</p>

<p>The %array and %pointer declarations were added as a
compromise between historical systems. The System V-based
lex copies the matched text to a yytext array. The flex
program, supported in BSD and GNU systems, uses a pointer.
In the latter case, significant performance improvements are
available for some scanners. Most historical programs should
require no change in porting from one system to another
because the string being referenced is null-terminated in
both cases. (The method used by flex in its case is to
null-terminate the token in place by remembering the
character that used to come right after the token and
replacing it before continuing on to the next scan.)
Multi-file programs with exter- nal references to yytext
outside the scanner source file should con- tinue to operate
on their historical systems, but would require one of the
new declarations to be considered strictly portable.</p>

<p>The description of EREs avoids unnecessary duplication
of ERE details because their meanings within a lex ERE are
the same as that for the ERE in this volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001.</p>

<p>The reason for the undefined condition associated with
text beginning with a &lt;blank&gt; or within &quot;%{&quot;
and &quot;%}&quot; delimiter lines appearing in the Rules
section is historical practice. Both the BSD and System V
lex copy the indented (or enclosed) input in the Rules
section (except at the beginning) to unreachable areas of
the yylex() function (the code is written directly after a
break statement). In some cases, the System V lex generates
an error message or a syntax error, depending on the form of
indented input.</p>

<p>The intention in breaking the list of functions into
those that may appear in lex.yy.c versus those that only
appear in libl.a is that only those functions in libl.a can
be reliably redefined by a conforming application.</p>

<p>The descriptions of standard output and standard error
are somewhat complicated because historical lex
implementations chose to issue diag- nostic messages to
standard output (unless -t was given). IEEE Std 1003.1-2001
allows this behavior, but leaves an opening for the more
expected behavior of using standard error for diagnostics.
Also, the System V behavior of writing the statistics when
any table sizes are given is allowed, while BSD-derived
systems can avoid it. The programmer can always precisely
obtain the desired results by using either the -t or -n
options.</p>

<p>The OPERANDS section does not mention the use of - as a
synonym for standard input; not all historical
implementations support such usage for any of the file
operands.</p>

<p>A description of the translation table was deleted from
early proposals because of its relatively low usage in
historical applications.</p>

<p>The change to the definition of the input() function
that allows buffering of input presents the opportunity for
major performance gains in some applications.</p>

<p>The following examples clarify the differences between
lex regular expressions and regular expressions appearing
elsewhere in this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001. For
regular expressions of the form &quot;r/x&quot;, the string
matching r is always returned; confusion may arise when the
beginning of x matches the trailing portion of r. For
example, given the regular expression &quot;a*b/cc&quot; and
the input &quot;aaabcc&quot;, yytext would contain the
string &quot;aaab&quot; on this match. But given the regular
expres- sion &quot;x*/xy&quot; and the input
&quot;xxxy&quot;, the token xxx, not xx, is returned by some
implementations because xxx matches &quot;x*&quot; .</p>

<p>In the rule &quot;ab*/bc&quot;, the &quot;b*&quot; at
the end of r extends r s match into the beginning of the
trailing context, so the result is unspecified. If this rule
were &quot;ab/bc&quot;, however, the rule matches the text
&quot;ab&quot; when it is followed by the text
&quot;bc&quot; . In this latter case, the matching of r
cannot extend into the beginning of x, so the result is
specified.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
