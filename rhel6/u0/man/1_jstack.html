<p>NAME jstack - Stack Trace</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS jstack [ option ] pid jstack [ option ]
executable core jstack [ option ]
[server-id@]remote-hostname-or-IP</p>

<p>PARAMETERS Options are mutually exclusive. Option, if
used, should follow immedi- ately after the command name.
See OPTIONS.</p>

<p>pid process id for which the stack trace is to be
printed. The pro- cess must be a Java process. To get a list
of Java processes run- ning on a machine, jps may be
used.</p>

<p>executable Java executable from which the core dump was
produced.</p>

<p>core core file for which the stack trace is to be
printed.</p>

<p>remote-hostname-or-IP remote debug servers (see
jsadebugd) hostname or IP address.</p>

<p>server-id optional unique id, if multiple debug servers
are running on the same remote host.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION jstack prints Java stack traces of Java
threads for a given Java pro- cess or core file or a remote
debug server. For each Java frame, the full class name,
method name, bci (byte code index) and line number, if
available, are printed. With the -m option, jstack prints
both Java and native frames of all threads along with the pc
(program counter). For each native frame, the closest native
symbol to pc, if available, is printed. C++ mangled names
are not demangled. To demangle C++ names, the output of this
command may be piped to c++filt. If the given pro- cess is
running on a 64-bit VM, you may need to specify the -J-d64
option, e.g.:</p>

<p>jstack -J-d64 -m pid</p>

<p>NOTE - This utility is unsupported and may or may not be
available in future versions of the JDK. The only form of
jstack that is available on Windows platforms is</p>

<p>jstack pid</p>

<p>OPTIONS -F Forces a stack dump when jstack pid does not
respond.</p>

<p>-m prints mixed mode (both Java and native C/C++ frames)
stack trace.</p>

<p>-h prints a help message.</p>

<p>-help prints a help message</p>

<p>o c++filt(1)</p>

<p>o jps</p>

<p>o jsadebugd</p>

<p>KNOWN BUGS Mixed mode stack trace, the -m option, does
not work with the remote debug server.</p>
