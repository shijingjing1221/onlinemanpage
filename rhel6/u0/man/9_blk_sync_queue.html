<p>BLK_SYNC_QUEUE(9) Block Devices BLK_SYNC_QUEUE(9)</p>

<p>NAME blk_sync_queue - cancel any pending callbacks on a
queue</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS void blk_sync_queue(struct request_queue *
q);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS q the queue</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The block layer may perform asynchronous
callback activity on a queue, such as calling the unplug
function after a timeout. A block device may call
blk_sync_queue to ensure that any such activity is
cancelled, thus allowing it to release resources that the
callbacks might use. The caller must already have made sure
that its -&gt;make_request_fn will not re-add plugging prior
to calling this function.</p>
