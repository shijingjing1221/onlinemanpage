<p>PTHREAD_SETCONCURRENCY(3) Linux Programmer s Manual
PTHREAD_SETCONCURRENCY(3)</p>

<p>NAME pthread_setconcurrency, pthread_getconcurrency -
set/get the concur- rency level</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;</p>

<p>int pthread_setconcurrency(int new_level); int
pthread_getconcurrency(void);</p>

<p>Compile and link with -pthread.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pthread_setconcurrency() function
informs the implementation of the applications desired
concurrency level, specified in new_level. The
implementation only takes this as a hint: POSIX.1 does not
specify the level of concurrency that should be provided as
a result of calling pthread_setconcurrency().</p>

<p>Specifying new_level as 0 instructs the implementation
to manage the concurrency level as it deems appropriate.</p>

<p>pthread_getconcurrency() returns the current value of
the concurrency level for this process.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, pthread_setconcurrency()
returns 0; on error, it returns a non-zero error number.</p>

<p>pthread_getconcurrency() always succeeds, returning the
concurrency level set by a previous call to
pthread_setconcurrency(), or 0, if pthread_setconcurrency()
has not previously been called.</p>

<p>ERRORS pthread_setconcurrency() can fail with the
following error:</p>

<p>EINVAL new_level is negative.</p>

<p>POSIX.1-2001 also documents an EAGAIN error (&quot;the
value specified by new_level would cause a system resource
to be exceeded&quot;).</p>

<p>VERSIONS These functions are available in glibc since
version 2.1.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>NOTES The default concurrency level is 0.</p>

<p>Concurrency levels are only meaningful for M:N threading
implementa- tions, where at any moment a subset of a
processs set of user-level threads may be bound to a smaller
number of kernel-scheduling entities. Setting the
concurrency level allows the application to give the system
a hint as to the number of kernel-scheduling entities that
should be provided for efficient execution of the
application.</p>

<p>Both LinuxThreads and NPTL are 1:1 threading
implementations, so set- ting the concurrency level has no
meaning. In other words, on Linux these functions merely
exist for compatibility with other systems, and they have no
effect on the execution of a program.</p>
