<p>FERAISEEXCEPT(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
FERAISEEXCEPT(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME feraiseexcept - raise floating-point exception</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;fenv.h&gt;</p>

<p>int feraiseexcept(int excepts);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The feraiseexcept() function shall attempt
to raise the supported floating-point exceptions represented
by the argument excepts. The order in which these
floating-point exceptions are raised is unspeci- fied.
Whether the feraiseexcept() function additionally raises the
inexact floating-point exception whenever it raises the
overflow or underflow floating-point exception is
implementation-defined.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE If the argument is zero or if all the
specified exceptions were suc- cessfully raised,
feraiseexcept() shall return zero. Otherwise, it shall
return a non-zero value.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The effect is intended to be similar
to that of floating-point excep- tions raised by arithmetic
operations. Hence, enabled traps for float- ing-point
exceptions raised by this function are taken.</p>

<p>RATIONALE Raising overflow or underflow is allowed to
also raise inexact because on some architectures the only
practical way to raise an exception is to execute an
instruction that has the exception as a side effect. The
function is not restricted to accept only valid coincident
expressions for atomic operations, so the function can be
used to raise exceptions accrued over several
operations.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
