<p>NAME slapo-syncprov - Sync Provider overlay to slapd</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS /etc/openldap/slapd.conf</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The Sync Provider overlay implements the
provider-side support for the LDAP Content Synchronization
(RFC4533) as well as syncrepl replication support. The
overlay can be used with any backend that maintains entryCSN
and entryUUID attributes for its entries. It also creates a
contextCSN attribute in the root entry of the database.</p>

<p>The contextCSN is updated for every write operation
performed against the database. To reduce database
contention, the contextCSN is only updated in memory. The
value is written to the database on server shut- down and
read into memory on startup, and maintained in memory there-
after. Checkpoints may be configured to write the contextCSN
into the underlying database to minimize recovery time after
an unclean shut- down.</p>

<p>On databases that support inequality indexing, it is
helpful to set an eq index on the entryCSN attribute when
using this overlay.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION These slapd.conf options apply to the Sync
Provider overlay. They should appear after the overlay
directive.</p>

<p>syncprov-checkpoint &lt;ops&gt; &lt;minutes&gt; After a
write operation has succeeded, write the contextCSN to the
underlying database if &lt;ops&gt; write operations or more
than &lt;minutes&gt; time have passed since the last
checkpoint. Check- pointing is disabled by default.</p>

<p>syncprov-sessionlog &lt;ops&gt; Configures an in-memory
session log for recording information about write operations
made on the database. The &lt;ops&gt; speci- fies the number
of operations that are recorded in the log. All write
operations (except Adds) are recorded in the log. When using
the session log, it is helpful to set an eq index on the
entryUUID attribute in the underlying database.</p>

<p>syncprov-nopresent TRUE | FALSE Specify that the Present
phase of refreshing should be skipped. This value should
only be set TRUE for a syncprov instance on top of a log
database (such as one managed by the accesslog overlay). The
default is FALSE.</p>

<p>syncprov-reloadhint TRUE | FALSE Specify that the
overlay should honor the reloadHint flag in the Sync
Control. In OpenLDAP releases 2.3.11 and earlier the syn-
crepl consumer did not properly set this flag, so the
overlay must ignore it. This option should be set TRUE when
working with newer releases that properly support this flag.
It must be set TRUE when using the accesslog overlay for
delta-based syncrepl replication support. The default is
FALSE.</p>
