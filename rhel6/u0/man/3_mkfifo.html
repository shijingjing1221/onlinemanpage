<p>NAME mkfifo - make a FIFO special file (a named
pipe)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; #include
&lt;sys/stat.h&gt;</p>

<p>int mkfifo(const char *pathname, mode_t mode);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION mkfifo() makes a FIFO special file with name
pathname. mode specifies the FIFO s permissions. It is
modified by the processs umask in the usual way: the
permissions of the created file are (mode &amp; ~umask).</p>

<p>A FIFO special file is similar to a pipe, except that it
is created in a different way. Instead of being an anonymous
communications channel, a FIFO special file is entered into
the file system by calling mkfifo().</p>

<p>Once you have created a FIFO special file in this way,
any process can open it for reading or writing, in the same
way as an ordinary file. However, it has to be open at both
ends simultaneously before you can proceed to do any input
or output operations on it. Opening a FIFO for reading
normally blocks until some other process opens the same FIFO
for writing, and vice versa. See fifo(7) for non-blocking
handling of FIFO special files.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success mkfifo() returns 0. In the case
of an error, -1 is returned (in which case, errno is set
appropriately).</p>

<p>ERRORS EACCES One of the directories in pathname did not
allow search (exe- cute) permission.</p>

<p>EEXIST pathname already exists. This includes the case
where pathname is a symbolic link, dangling or not.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG Either the total length of pathname is
greater than PATH_MAX, or an individual filename component
has a length greater than NAME_MAX. In the GNU system, there
is no imposed limit on over- all filename length, but some
file systems may place limits on the length of a
component.</p>

<p>ENOENT A directory component in pathname does not exist
or is a dan- gling symbolic link.</p>

<p>ENOSPC The directory or file system has no room for the
new file.</p>

<p>ENOTDIR A component used as a directory in pathname is
not, in fact, a directory.</p>

<p>EROFS pathname refers to a read-only file system.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO POSIX.1-2001.</p>
