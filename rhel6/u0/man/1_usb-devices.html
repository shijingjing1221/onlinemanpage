<p>NAME usb-devices - print USB device details</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS usb-devices</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION usb-devices is a (bash) shell script that
can be used to display details of USB buses in the system
and the devices connected to them.</p>

<p>The output of the script is similar to the usb/devices
file available either under /proc/bus (if usbfs is mounted),
or under /sys/ker- nel/debug (if debugfs is mounted there).
The script is primairily intended to be used if the file is
not available.</p>

<p>In contrast to the usb/devices file, this script only
lists active interfaces (those marked with a &quot;*&quot;
in the usb/devices file) and their endpoints.</p>

<p>Be advised that there can be differences in the way
information is sorted, as well as in the format of the
output.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE If sysfs is not mounted, a non-zero exit
code is returned.</p>

<p>FILES /sys/bus/usb/devices/usb* The part of the sysfs
tree the script walks through to assemble the printed
information.</p>

<p>/proc/bus/usb/devices Location where the usb/devices
file can normally be found for Linux kernels before 2.6.31,
if usbfs is mounted.</p>

<p>/sys/kernel/debug/usb/devices Location where the
usb/devices file can normally be found for Linux kernel
2.6.31 and later, if debugfs is mounted.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO lsusb(8), usbview(8).</p>
