<p>ECVT(3) Linux Programmer s Manual ECVT(3)</p>

<p>NAME ecvt, fcvt - convert a floating-point number to a
string</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</p>

<p>char *ecvt(double number, int ndigits, int *decpt, int
*sign);</p>

<p>char *fcvt(double number, int ndigits, int *decpt, int
*sign);</p>

<p>Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
feature_test_macros(7)):</p>

<p>ecvt(), fcvt(): _SVID_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;=
500</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The ecvt() function converts number to a
null-terminated string of ndigits digits (where ndigits is
reduced to a system-specific limit determined by the
precision of a double), and returns a pointer to the string.
The high-order digit is non-zero, unless number is zero. The
low order digit is rounded. The string itself does not
contain a deci- mal point; however, the position of the
decimal point relative to the start of the string is stored
in *decpt. A negative value for *decpt means that the
decimal point is to the left of the start of the string. If
the sign of number is negative, *sign is set to a non-zero
value, otherwise it is set to 0. If number is zero, it is
unspecified whether *decpt is 0 or 1.</p>

<p>The fcvt() function is identical to ecvt(), except that
ndigits speci- fies the number of digits after the decimal
point.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Both the ecvt() and fcvt() functions return
a pointer to a static string containing the ASCII
representation of number. The static string is overwritten
by each call to ecvt() or fcvt().</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO SVr2; marked as LEGACY in POSIX.1-2001.
POSIX.1-2008 removes the spec- ifications of ecvt() and
fcvt(), recommending the use of sprintf(3) instead (though
snprintf(3) may be preferable).</p>

<p>NOTES Linux libc4 and libc5 specified the type of
ndigits as size_t. Not all locales use a point as the radix
character (&quot;decimal point&quot;).</p>
