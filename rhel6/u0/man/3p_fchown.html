<p>FCHOWN(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual FCHOWN(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME fchown - change owner and group of a file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>int fchown(int fildes, uid_t owner, gid_t group);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The fchown() function shall be equivalent to
chown() except that the file whose owner and group are
changed is specified by the file descriptor fildes.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, fchown() shall
return 0. Otherwise, it shall return -1 and set errno to
indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The fchown() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EBADF The fildes argument is not an open file
descriptor.</p>

<p>EPERM The effective user ID does not match the owner of
the file or the process does not have appropriate privilege
and _POSIX_CHOWN_RESTRICTED indicates that such privilege is
required.</p>

<p>EROFS The file referred to by fildes resides on a
read-only file sys- tem.</p>

<p>The fchown() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The owner or group ID is not a value supported by
the implemen- tation. The fildes argument refers to a pipe
or socket or an fattach()-ed STREAM and the implementation
disallows execution of fchown() on a pipe.</p>

<p>EIO A physical I/O error has occurred.</p>

<p>EINTR The fchown() function was interrupted by a signal
which was caught.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Changing the Current Owner of a File The
following example shows how to change the owner of a file
named /home/cnd/mod1 to &quot;jones&quot; and the group to
&quot;cnd&quot;.</p>

<p>The numeric value for the user ID is obtained by
extracting the user ID from the user database entry
associated with &quot;jones&quot;. Similarly, the numeric
value for the group ID is obtained by extracting the group
ID from the group database entry associated with
&quot;cnd&quot;. This example assumes the calling program
has appropriate privileges.</p>

<p>#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
#include &lt;fcntl.h&gt; #include &lt;pwd.h&gt; #include
&lt;grp.h&gt;</p>

<p>struct passwd *pwd; struct group *grp; int fildes; ...
fildes = open(&quot;/home/cnd/mod1&quot;, O_RDWR); pwd =
getpwnam(&quot;jones&quot;); grp =
getgrnam(&quot;cnd&quot;); fchown(fildes, pwd-&gt;pw_uid,
grp-&gt;gr_gid);</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
