<p>XHOST(1) XHOST(1)</p>

<p>NAME xhost - server access control program for X</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS xhost [[+-]name ...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The xhost program is used to add and delete
host names or user names to the list allowed to make
connections to the X server. In the case of hosts, this
provides a rudimentary form of privacy control and secu-
rity. It is only sufficient for a workstation (single user)
environ- ment, although it does limit the worst abuses.
Environments which require more sophisticated measures
should implement the user-based mechanism or use the hooks
in the protocol for passing other authenti- cation data to
the server.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Xhost accepts the following command line options
described below. For security, the options that affect
access control may only be run from the &quot;controlling
host&quot;. For workstations, this is the same machine as
the server. For X terminals, it is the login host.</p>

<p>-help Prints a usage message.</p>

<p>[+]name The given name (the plus sign is optional) is
added to the list allowed to connect to the X server. The
name can be a host name or a user name.</p>

<p>-name The given name is removed from the list of allowed
to connect to the server. The name can be a host name or a
user name. Existing connections are not broken, but new
connection attempts will be denied. Note that the current
machine is allowed to be removed; however, further
connections (including attempts to add it back) will not be
permitted. Resetting the server (thereby breaking all
connections) is the only way to allow local connections
again.</p>

<p>+ Access is granted to everyone, even if they arent on
the list (i.e., access control is turned off).</p>

<p>- Access is restricted to only those on the list (i.e.,
access control is turned on).</p>

<p>nothing If no command line arguments are given, a
message indicating whether or not access control is
currently enabled is printed, followed by the list of those
allowed to connect. This is the only option that may be used
from machines other than the con- trolling host.</p>

<p>NAMES A complete name has the syntax family:name where
the families are as follows:</p>

<p>inet Internet host (IPv4) inet6 Internet host (IPv6)
dnet DECnet host nis Secure RPC network name krb Kerberos V5
principal local contains only one name, the empty string si
Server Interpreted</p>

<p>The family is case insensitive. The format of the name
varies with the family.</p>

<p>When Secure RPC is being used, the network independent
netname (e.g., &quot;nis:unix.uid@domainname&quot;) can be
specified, or a local user can be specified with just the
username and a trailing at-sign (e.g.,
&quot;nis:pat@&quot;).</p>

<p>For backward compatibility with pre-R6 xhost, names that
contain an at- sign (@) are assumed to be in the nis family.
Otherwise they are assumed to be Internet addresses. If
compiled to support IPv6, then all IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
returned by getaddrinfo(3) are added to the access list in
the appropriate inet or inet6 family.</p>

<p>Server interpreted addresses consist of a case-sensitive
type tag and a string representing a given value, separated
by a colon. For example, &quot;si:hostname:almas&quot; is a
server interpreted address of type hostname, with a value of
almas. For more information on the available forms of server
interpreted addresses, see the Xsecurity(7) manual page.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS For each name added to the access control
list, a line of the form &quot;name being added to access
control list&quot; is printed. For each name removed from
the access control list, a line of the form &quot;name being
removed from access control list&quot; is printed.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/X*.hosts</p>

<p>SEE ALSO X(7), Xsecurity(7), Xserver(1), xdm(1),
xauth(1), getaddrinfo(3)</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT DISPLAY to get the default host and display
to use.</p>

<p>BUGS You can t specify a display on the command line
because -display is a valid command line argument
(indicating that you want to remove the machine named
display_from the access list).</p>

<p>The X server stores network addresses, not host names,
unless you use the server-interpreted hostname type address.
If somehow you change a host s network address while the
server is still running, and you are using a network-address
based form of authentication, xhost must be used to add the
new address and/or remove the old address.</p>
