<p>NAME sg_rmsn - sends a SCSI READ MEDIA SERIAL NUMBER
command</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sg_rmsn [--help] [--raw] [--verbose]
[--version] DEVICE</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Send a SCSI READ MEDIA SERIAL NUMBER command
to DEVICE and outputs the response.</p>

<p>This command is described in SPC-3 found at www.t10.org
. It was origi- nally added to SPC-3 in revision 11
(2003/2/12). It is not an mandatory command and the author
has not seen any SCSI devices that support it.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Arguments to long options are mandatory for
short options as well.</p>

<p>-h, --help output the usage message then exit.</p>

<p>-r, --raw sends the serial number (if found) to stdout.
This output may contain non-printable characters (e.g. the
serial number is padded with NULLs at the end so its length
is a multiple of 4). The default action is to print the
serial number out in ASCII-HEX with ASCII characters to the
right. All error messages are sent to stderr.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose increase the level of verbosity, (i.e.
debug output).</p>

<p>-V, --version print the version string and then
exit.</p>

<p>NOTES Device identification information is also found in
a standard INQUIRY response and its VPD pages (see sg_vpd).
The relevant VPD pages are the &quot;device identification
page&quot; (VPD page 0x83) and the &quot;unit serial num-
ber&quot; page (VPD page 0x80).</p>

<p>The MMC-4 command set for CD/DVD/HD-DVD/BD drives has a
&quot;media serial number&quot; feature (0x109) [and a
&quot;logical unit serial number&quot; feature]. These can
be viewed with sg_get_config.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The exit status of sg_rmsn is 0 when it is
successful. Otherwise see the sg3_utils(8) man page.</p>
