<p>NAME lvextend - extend the size of a logical volume</p>

LogicalVolumePath [PhysicalVolumePath[:PE[-PE]]...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION lvextend allows you to extend the size of a
logical volume. Extension of snapshot logical volumes (see
lvcreate(8) for information to create snapshots) is
supported as well. But to change the number of copies in a
mirrored logical volume use lvconvert(8).</p>

<p>OPTIONS See lvm for common options.</p>

<p>--noudevsync Disable udev synchronisation. The process
will not wait for notification from udev. It will continue
irrespective of any possible udev processing in the
background. You should only use this if udev is not running
or has rules that ignore the devices LVM2 creates.</p>

<p>-l, --extents
[+]LogicalExtentsNumber[%{VG|LV|PVS|FREE|ORIGIN}] Extend or
set the logical volume size in units of logical extents.
With the + sign the value is added to the actual size of the
logical volume and without it, the value is taken as an
absolute one. The number can also be expressed as a
percentage of the total space in the Volume Group with the
suffix %VG, rel- ative to the existing size of the Logical
Volume with the suffix %LV, of the remaining free space for
the specified PhysicalVol- ume(s) with the suffix %PVS, as a
percentage of the remaining free space in the Volume Group
with the suffix %FREE, or (for a snapshot) as a percentage
of the total space in the Origin Logi- cal Volume with the
suffix %ORIGIN.</p>

<p>-L, --size [+]LogicalVolumeSize[bBsSkKmMgGtTpPeE] Extend
or set the logical volume size in units of megabytes. A size
suffix of M for megabytes, G for gigabytes, T for ter-
abytes, P for petabytes or E for exabytes is optional. With
the + sign the value is added to the actual size of the
logical vol- ume and without it, the value is taken as an
absolute one.</p>

<p>-i, --stripes Stripes Gives the number of stripes for
the extension. Not applicable to LVs using the original
metadata LVM format, which must use a single value
throughout.</p>

<p>-I, --stripesize StripeSize Gives the number of
kilobytes for the granularity of the stripes. Not applicable
to LVs using the original metadata LVM format, which must
use a single value throughout. StripeSize must be 2^n (n = 2
to 9)</p>

<p>-f, --force Proceed with size extension without
prompting.</p>

<p>-n, --nofsck Do not perform fsck before extending
filesystem when filesystem requires it. You may need to use
--force to proceed with this option.</p>

<p>-r, --resizefs Resize underlying filesystem together
with the logical volume using fsadm(8).</p>

<p>Examples &quot;lvextend -L +54 /dev/vg01/lvol10
/dev/sdk3&quot; tries to extend the size of that logical
volume by 54MB on physical volume /dev/sdk3. This is only
possible if /dev/sdk3 is a member of volume group vg01 and
there are enough free physical extents in it.</p>

<p>&quot;lvextend /dev/vg01/lvol01 /dev/sdk3&quot; tries to
extend the size of that logical volume by the amount of free
space on physical volume /dev/sdk3. This is equivalent to
specifying &quot;-l +100%PVS&quot; on the com- mand
line.</p>

<p>&quot;lvextend -L+16M vg01/lvol01 /dev/sda:8-9
/dev/sdb:8-9&quot; tries to extend a logical volume
&quot;vg01/lvol01&quot; by 16MB using physical extents
/dev/sda:8-9 and /dev/sdb:8-9 for allocation of extents.</p>
