<p>NAME sensors - print sensors information</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sensors [ options ] [ chips ] sensors -s [
chips ] sensors --bus-list</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION sensors is used to show the current readings
of all sensor chips. sensors -s is used to set all limits as
specified in the configuration file. sensors --bus-list is
used to generate bus statements suitable for the
configuration file.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -c config-file Specify a configuration file. If
no file is specified, the lib- sensors default configuration
file is used. Use -c /dev/null to temporarily disable this
default configuration file.</p>

<p>-h Print a help text and exit.</p>

<p>-s Evaluate all set statements in the configuration file
and exit. You must be root to do this. If this parameter is
not specified, no set statement is evaluated.</p>

<p>-A Do not show the adapter for each chip.</p>

<p>-u Raw output. This mode is only meant for
debugging.</p>

<p>-v Print the program version and exit.</p>

<p>-f Print the temperatures in degrees Fahrenheit instead
of Celsius.</p>

<p>--bus-list Generate bus statements suitable for using in
sensors.conf. Such bus statements are only needed if you
have several chips sharing the same address on different
buses of the same type. As bus numbers are usually not
guaranteed to be stable over reboots, these statements let
you refer to each bus by its name rather than numbers.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/sensors3.conf /etc/sensors.conf The system
wide configuration file. See sensors.conf(5) for fur- ther
details.</p>
