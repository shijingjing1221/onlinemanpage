<p>NAME papi_native_avail - provides detailed information
for PAPI native events.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS papi_native_avail</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION papi_native_avail is a PAPI utility program
that reports information about the native events available

to a specific hardware platform. On many platforms, a
specific native event may have a number of optional set-
tings. In such cases, the native event and the valid
settings are pre- sented, rather than every possible
combination of those settings. For each native event, a
name, a description, and specific bit patterns are
provided.</p>

<p>OPTIONS This utility has no command line options.</p>

<p>BUGS There are no known bugs in this utility.</p>

<p>If you find a bug, it should be reported to the PAPI
Mailing List at &lt;ptools-perfapi@ptools.org&gt;.</p>
