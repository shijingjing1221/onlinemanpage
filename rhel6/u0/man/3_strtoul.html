<p>STRTOUL(3) Linux Programmer s Manual STRTOUL(3)</p>

<p>NAME strtoul, strtoull, strtouq - convert a string to an
unsigned long inte- ger</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</p>

<p>unsigned long int strtoul(const char *nptr, char
**endptr, int base);</p>

<p>unsigned long long int strtoull(const char *nptr, char
**endptr, int base);</p>

<p>Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
feature_test_macros(7)):</p>

<p>strtoull(): XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;= 600 || _BSD_SOURCE ||
_SVID_SOURCE || _ISOC99_SOURCE; or cc -std=c99</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The strtoul() function converts the initial
part of the string in nptr to an unsigned long int value
according to the given base, which must be between 2 and 36
inclusive, or be the special value 0.</p>

<p>The string may begin with an arbitrary amount of white
space (as deter- mined by isspace(3)) followed by a single
optional &rsquo;+&rsquo; or &rsquo;-&rsquo; sign. If base is
zero or 16, the string may then include a &quot;0x&quot;
prefix, and the number will be read in base 16; otherwise, a
zero base is taken as 10 (decimal) unless the next character
is &rsquo;0&rsquo;, in which case it is taken as 8
(octal).</p>

<p>The remainder of the string is converted to an unsigned
long int value in the obvious manner, stopping at the first
character which is not a valid digit in the given base. (In
bases above 10, the letter &rsquo;A&rsquo; in either upper
or lower case represents 10, &rsquo;B&rsquo; represents 11,
and so forth, with &rsquo;Z&rsquo; representing 35.)</p>

<p>If endptr is not NULL, strtoul() stores the address of
the first invalid character in *endptr. If there were no
digits at all, str- toul() stores the original value of nptr
in *endptr (and returns 0). In particular, if *nptr is not
&rsquo; &rsquo; but **endptr is &rsquo; &rsquo; on return,
the entire string is valid.</p>

<p>The strtoull() function works just like the strtoul()
function but returns an unsigned long long int value.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The strtoul() function returns either the
result of the conversion or, if there was a leading minus
sign, the negation of the result of the conversion
represented as an unsigned value, unless the original (non-
negated) value would overflow; in the latter case, strtoul()
returns ULONG_MAX and sets errno to ERANGE. Precisely the
same holds for str- toull() (with ULLONG_MAX instead of
ULONG_MAX).</p>

<p>ERRORS EINVAL (not in C99) The given base contains an
unsupported value.</p>

<p>ERANGE The resulting value was out of range.</p>

<p>The implementation may also set errno to EINVAL in case
no conversion was performed (no digits seen, and 0
returned).</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO strtoul() conforms to SVr4, C89, C99 and
POSIX-2001, and strtoull() to C99 and POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>NOTES Since strtoul() can legitimately return 0 or
LONG_MAX (LLONG_MAX for strtoull()) on both success and
failure, the calling program should set errno to 0 before
the call, and then determine if an error occurred by
checking whether errno has a non-zero value after the
call.</p>

<p>In locales other than the &quot;C&quot; locale, other
strings may be accepted. (For example, the thousands
separator of the current locale may be sup- ported.)</p>

<p>BSD also has</p>

<p>u_quad_t strtouq(const char *nptr, char **endptr, int
base);</p>

<p>with completely analogous definition. Depending on the
wordsize of the current architecture, this may be equivalent
to strtoull() or to str- toul().</p>

<p>Negative values are considered valid input and are
silently converted to the equivalent unsigned long int
value.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE See the example on the strtol(3) manual page;
the use of the functions described in this manual page is
similar.</p>
