<p>VIRT-TAR(1) Virtualization Support VIRT-TAR(1)</p>

<p>NAME virt-tar - Extract or upload files to a virtual
machine</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS virt-tar [--options] -x domname directory
tarball</p>

<p>virt-tar [--options] -u domname tarball directory</p>

<p>virt-tar [--options] disk.img [disk.img ...] -x
directory tarball</p>

<p>virt-tar [--options] disk.img [disk.img ...] -u tarball
directory</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Download &quot;/home&quot; from the VM into a
local tarball:</p>

<p>virt-tar -x domname /home home.tar</p>

<p>virt-tar -zx domname /home home.tar.gz</p>

<p>Upload a local tarball and unpack it inside
&quot;/tmp&quot; in the VM:</p>

<p>virt-tar -u domname uploadstuff.tar /tmp</p>

<p>virt-tar -zu domname uploadstuff.tar.gz /tmp</p>

<p>WARNING You must not use &quot;virt-tar&quot; with the
&quot;-u&quot; option (upload) on live virtual machines. If
you do this, you risk disk corruption in the VM.
&quot;virt-tar&quot; tries to stop you from doing this, but
doesnt catch all cases.</p>

<p>You can use &quot;-x&quot; (extract) on live virtual
machines, but you might get inconsistent results or errors
if there is filesystem activity inside the VM. If the live
VM is synched and quiescent, then &quot;virt-tar&quot; will
usually work, but the only way to guarantee consistent
results is if the virtual machine is shut down.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION &quot;virt-tar&quot; is a general purpose
archive tool for downloading and uploading parts of a guest
filesystem. There are many possibilities: making backups,
uploading data files, snooping on guest activity, fixing or
customizing guests, etc.</p>

<p>If you want to just view a single file, use virt-cat(1).
If you just want to edit a single file, use virt-edit(1).
For more complex cases you should look at the guestfish(1)
tool.</p>

<p>There are two modes of operation: &quot;-x&quot;
(eXtract) downloads a directory and its contents
(recursively) from the virtual machine into a local tarball.
&quot;-u&quot; uploads from a local tarball, unpacking it
into a directory inside the virtual machine. You cannot use
these two options together.</p>

<p>In addition, you may need to use the &quot;-z&quot;
(gZip) option to enable compression. When uploading, you
have to specify &quot;-z&quot; if the upload file is
compressed because virt-tar wont detect this on its own.</p>

<p>&quot;virt-tar&quot; can only handle tar (optionally
gzipped) format tarballs. For example it cannot do PKZip
files or bzip2 compression. If you want that then youll have
to rebuild the tarballs yourself. (This is a limitation of
the libguestfs(3) API).</p>

<p>OPTIONS --help Display brief help.</p>

<p>--version Display version number and exit.</p>

<p>--connect URI | -c URI If using libvirt, connect to the
given URI. If omitted, then we connect to the default
libvirt hypervisor.</p>

<p>If you specify guest block devices directly, then
libvirt is not used at all.</p>

<p>-x | --extract | --download -u | --upload Use
&quot;-x&quot; to extract (download) a directory from a
virtual machine to a local tarball.</p>

<p>Use &quot;-u&quot; to upload and unpack from a local
tarball into a virtual machine. Please read the
&quot;WARNING&quot; section above before using this
option.</p>

<p>You must specify exactly one of these options.</p>

<p>-z | --gzip Specify that the input or output tarball is
gzip-compressed.</p>
