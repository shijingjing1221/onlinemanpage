<p>NAME vacuumdb - garbage-collect and analyze a PostgreSQL
database</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS vacuumdb [ connection-option... ] [ [ --full ]
[ -f ] ] [ [ --verbose ] [ -v ] ] [ [ --analyze ] [ -z ] ] [
[ --freeze ] [ -F ] ] [ --table | -t table [ ( column [,...]
) ] ] [ dbname ]</p>

<p>vacuumdb [ connection-options... ] [ [ --all ] [ -a ] ]
[ [ --full ] [ -f ] ] [ [ --verbose ] [ -v ] ] [ [ --analyze
] [ -z ] ] [ [ --freeze ] [ -F ] ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION vacuumdb is a utility for cleaning a
PostgreSQL database. vacuumdb will also generate internal
statistics used by the PostgreSQL query optimizer.</p>

<p>vacuumdb is a wrapper around the SQL command VACUUM
[vacuum(7)]. There is no effective difference between
vacuuming databases via this utility and via other methods
for accessing the server.</p>

<p>OPTIONS vacuumdb accepts the following command-line
arguments:</p>

<p>-a</p>

<p>--all Vacuum all databases.</p>

<p>[-d] dbname</p>

<p>[--dbname] dbname Specifies the name of the database to
be cleaned or analyzed. If this is not specified and -a (or
--all) is not used, the database name is read from the
environment variable PGDATABASE. If that is not set, the
user name specified for the connection is used.</p>

<p>-e</p>

<p>--echo Echo the commands that vacuumdb generates and
sends to the server.</p>

<p>-f</p>

<p>--full Perform full vacuuming.</p>

<p>-q</p>

<p>--quiet Do not display progress messages.</p>

<p>-t table [ (column [,...]) ]</p>

<p>--table table [ (column [,...]) ] Clean or analyze table
only. Column names can be specified only in conjunction with
the --analyze option.</p>

<p>Tip: If you specify columns, you probably have to escape
the parentheses from the shell. (See examples below.)</p>

<p>-v</p>

<p>--verbose Print detailed information during
processing.</p>

<p>-z</p>

<p>--analyze Calculate statistics for use by the
optimizer.</p>

<p>-F</p>

<p>--freeze Aggressively freeze tuples.</p>

<p>vacuumdb also accepts the following command-line
arguments for connec- tion parameters:</p>

<p>-h host</p>

<p>--host host Specifies the host name of the machine on
which the server is running. If the value begins with a
slash, it is used as the directory for the Unix domain
socket.</p>

<p>-p port</p>

<p>--port port Specifies the TCP port or local Unix domain
socket file exten- sion on which the server is listening for
connections.</p>

<p>-U username</p>

<p>--username username User name to connect as.</p>

<p>-w</p>

<p>--no-password Never issue a password prompt. If the
server requires password authentication and a password is
not available by other means such as a .pgpass file, the
connection attempt will fail. This option can be useful in
batch jobs and scripts where no user is present to enter a
password.</p>

<p>-W</p>

<p>--password Force vacuumdb to prompt for a password
before connecting to a database.</p>

<p>This option is never essential, since vacuumdb will
automati- cally prompt for a password if the server demands
password authentication. However, vacuumdb will waste a
connection attempt finding out that the server wants a
password. In some cases it is worth typing -W to avoid the
extra connection attempt.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT PGDATABASE</p>

<p>PGHOST</p>

<p>PGPORT</p>

<p>PGUSER Default connection parameters</p>

<p>This utility, like most other PostgreSQL utilities, also
uses the envi- ronment variables supported by libpq (see in
the documentation).</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS In case of difficulty, see VACUUM
[vacuum(7)] and psql(1) for discus- sions of potential
problems and error messages. The database server must be
running at the targeted host. Also, any default connection
set- tings and environment variables used by the libpq
front-end library will apply.</p>

<p>NOTES vacuumdb might need to connect several times to
the PostgreSQL server, asking for a password each time. It
is convenient to have a ~/.pgpass file in such cases. See in
the documentation for more information.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES To clean the database test:</p>

<p>$ vacuumdb test</p>

<p>To clean and analyze for the optimizer a database named
bigdb:</p>

<p>$ vacuumdb --analyze bigdb</p>

<p>To clean a single table foo in a database named xyzzy,
and analyze a single column bar of the table for the
optimizer:</p>

<p>$ vacuumdb --analyze --verbose --tablefoo(bar)xyzzy</p>
