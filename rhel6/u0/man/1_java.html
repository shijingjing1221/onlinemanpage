<p>NAME java - the Java application launcher</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS java [ options ] class [ argument ... ] java [
options ] -jar file.jar [ argument ... ]</p>

<p>options Command-line options.</p>

<p>class Name of the class to be invoked.</p>

<p>file.jar Name of the jar file to be invoked. Used only
with -jar.</p>

<p>argument Argument passed to the main function.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The java tool launches a Java application.
It does this by starting a Java runtime environment, loading
a specified class, and invoking that classs main method.</p>

<p>The method must be declared public and static, it must
not return any value, and it must accept a String array as a
parameter. The method declaration must look like the
following:</p>

<p>public static void main(String args[])</p>

<p>By default, the first non-option argument is the name of
the class to be invoked. A fully-qualified class name should
be used. If the -jar option is specified, the first
non-option argument is the name of a JAR archive containing
class and resource files for the application, with the
startup class indicated by the Main-Class manifest
header.</p>

<p>The Java runtime searches for the startup class, and
other classes used, in three sets of locations: the
bootstrap class path, the installed extensions, and the user
class path.</p>

<p>Non-option arguments after the class name or JAR file
name are passed to the main function.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The launcher has a set of standard options that
are supported on the current runtime environment and will be
supported in future releases. In addition, the current
implementations of the virtual machines support a set of
non-standard options that are subject to change in future
releases.</p>

<p>Standard Options -client</p>

<p>Select the Java HotSpot Client VM. A 64-bit capable jdk
currently ignores this option and instead uses the Java
Hotspot Server VM.</p>

<p>For default VM selection, see Server-Class Machine
Detection</p>

<p>-server</p>

<p>Select the Java HotSpot Server VM. On a 64-bit capable
jdk only the Java Hotspot Server VM is supported so the
-server option is implicit.</p>

<p>For default VM selection, see Server-Class Machine
Detection</p>

<p>-agentlib:libname[=options] Load native agent library
libname, e.g.</p>

<p>-agentlib:hprof</p>

<p>-agentlib:jdwp=help</p>

<p>-agentlib:hprof=help</p>

<p>For more information, see JVMTI Agent Command Line
Options.</p>

<p>-agentpath:pathname[=options] Load a native agent
library by full pathname. For more informa- tion, see JVMTI
Agent Command Line Options.</p>

<p>-classpath classpath</p>

<p>-cp classpath Specify a list of directories, JAR
archives, and ZIP archives to search for class files. Class
path entries are separated by colons (:). Specifying
-classpath or -cp overrides any setting of the CLASSPATH
environment variable.</p>

<p>If -classpath and -cp are not used and CLASSPATH is not
set, the user class path consists of the current directory
(.).</p>

<p>As a special convenience, a class path element
containing a basename of * is considered equivalent to
specifying a list of all the files in the directory with the
extension .jar or .JAR (a java program cannot tell the
difference between the two invocations). For example, if
directory foo contains a.jar and b.JAR, then the class path
element foo/* is expanded to a A.jar:b.JAR, except that the
order of jar files is unspecified. All jar files in the
speci- fied directory, even hidden ones, are included in the
list. A class- path entry consisting simply of * expands to
a list of all the jar files in the current directory. The
CLASSPATH environment variable, where defined, will be
similarly expanded. Any classpath wildcard expansion occurs
before the Java virtual machine is started -- no Java
program will ever see unexpanded wildcards except by
querying the environment. For example; by invoking
System.getenv(&quot;CLASS- PATH&quot;).</p>

<p>For more information on class paths, see Setting the
Class Path.</p>

<p>-Dproperty=value Set a system property value.</p>

<p>-d32</p>

<p>-d64 Request that the program to be run in a 32-bit or
64-bit environ- ment, respectively. If the requested
environment is not installed or is not supported, an error
is reported.</p>

<p>Currently only the Java HotSpot Server VM supports
64-bit operation, and the &quot;-server&quot; option is
implicit with the use of -d64. And the &quot;-client&quot;
option is ignored with the use of -d64. This is subject to
change in a future release.</p>

<p>If neither -d32 nor -d64 is specified, the default is to
run in a 32-bit environment, except for 64-bit only systems.
This is subject to change in a future release.</p>

<p>-enableassertions[:&lt;package name&gt;&quot;...&quot; |
:&lt;class name&gt; ]</p>

<p>-ea[:&lt;package name&gt;&quot;...&quot; | :&lt;class
name&gt; ] Enable assertions. Assertions are disabled by
default.</p>

<p>With no arguments, enableassertions or -ea enables
assertions. With one argument ending in &quot;...&quot;, the
switch enables assertions in the specified package and any
subpackages. If the argument is simply &quot;...&quot;, the
switch enables assertions in the unnamed package in the
current working directory. With one argument not ending in
&quot;...&quot;, the switch enables assertions in the
specified class.</p>

<p>If a single command line contains multiple instances of
these switches, they are processed in order before loading
any classes. So, for example, to run a program with
assertions enabled only in package com.wombat.fruitbat (and
any subpackages), the following command could be used:</p>

<p>java -ea:com.wombat.fruitbat... &lt;Main Class&gt;</p>

<p>The -enableassertions and -ea switches apply to all
class loaders and to system classes (which do not have a
class loader). There is one exception to this rule: in their
no-argument form, the switches do not apply to system. This
makes it easy to turn on asserts in all classes except for
system classes. A separate switch is provided to enable
asserts in all system classes; see -enablesystemassertions
below.</p>

<p>-disableassertions[:&lt;package name&gt;&quot;...&quot;
| :&lt;class name&gt; ]</p>

<p>-da[:&lt;package name&gt;&quot;...&quot; | :&lt;class
name&gt; ] Disable assertions. This is the default.</p>

<p>With no arguments, disableassertions or -da disables
assertions. With one argument ending in &quot;...&quot;, the
switch disables assertions in the specified package and any
subpackages. If the argument is simply &quot;...&quot;, the
switch disables assertions in the unnamed package in the
current working directory. With one argument not ending in
&quot;...&quot;, the switch disables assertions in the
specified class.</p>

<p>To run a program with assertions enabled in package
com.wom- bat.fruitbat but disabled in class
com.wombat.fruitbat.Brickbat, the following command could be
used:</p>

<p>java -ea:com.wombat.fruitbat...
-da:com.wombat.fruitbat.Brickbat &lt;Main Class&gt;</p>

<p>The -disableassertions and -da switches apply to all
class loaders and to system classes (which do not have a
class loader). There is one exception to this rule: in their
no-argument form, the switches do not apply to system. This
makes it easy to turn on asserts in all classes except for
system classes. A separate switch is provided to enable
asserts in all system classes; see -disablesystemassertions
below.</p>

<p>-enablesystemassertions</p>

<p>-esa Enable asserts in all system classes (sets the
default assertion status for system classes to true).</p>

<p>-disablesystemassertions</p>

<p>-dsa Disables asserts in all system classes.</p>

<p>-jar Execute a program encapsulated in a JAR file. The
first argument is the name of a JAR file instead of a
startup class name. In order for this option to work, the
manifest of the JAR file must contain a line of the form
Main-Class: classname. Here, classname identifies the class
having the pub- lic static void main(String[] args) method
that serves as your application s starting point. See the
Jar tool reference page and the Jar trail of the Java
Tutorial @ http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/jar for
information about working with Jar files and Jar-file
manifests.</p>

<p>When you use this option, the JAR file is the source of
all user classes, and other user class path settings are
ignored.</p>

<p>Note that JAR files that can be run with the &quot;java
-jar&quot; option can have their execute permissions set so
they can be run without using &quot;java -jar&quot;. Refer
to Java Archive (JAR) Files.</p>

<p>-javaagent:jarpath[=options] Load a Java programming
language agent, see java.lang.instrument.</p>

<p>-verbose</p>

<p>-verbose:class Display information about each class
loaded.</p>

<p>-verbose:gc Report on each garbage collection event.</p>

<p>-verbose:jni Report information about use of native
methods and other Java Native Interface activity.</p>

<p>-version Display version information and exit.</p>

<p>-version:release Specifies that the version specified by
release is required by the class or jar file specified on
the command line. If the ver- sion of the java command
invoked does not meet this specification and an appropriate
implementation is found on the system, the appropriate
implementation will be used.</p>

<p>release not only can specify an exact version, but can
also specify a list of versions called a version string. A
version string is an ordered list of version ranges
separated by spaces. A version range is either a version-id,
a version-id followed by a star (*), a ver- sion-id followed
by a plus sign (+) , or two version-ranges combined using an
ampersand (&amp;). The star means prefix match, the plus
sign means this version or greater, and the ampersand means
the logical anding of the two version-ranges. For
example:</p>

<p>-version:&quot;1.5.0_04 1.5*&amp;1.5.1_02+&quot;</p>

<p>The meaning of the above is that the class or jar file
requires either version 1.5.0_02, or a version with 1.5 as a
version-id pre- fix and that is not less than 1.5.1_02. The
exact syntax and defini- tion of version strings may be
found in Appendix A of the Java Net- work Launching Protocol
&amp; API Specification (JSR-56).</p>

<p>For jar files, the usual preference is to specify
version require- ments in the jar file manifest rather than
on the command line.</p>

<p>See the following NOTES section for important policy
information on the use of this option.</p>

<p>-showversion Display version information and
continue.</p>

<p>-?</p>

<p>-help Display usage information and exit.</p>

<p>-X Display information about non-standard options and
exit.</p>

<p>Non-Standard Options -Xint Operate in interpreted-only
mode. Compilation to native code is disabled, and all
bytecodes are executed by the inter- preter. The performance
benefits offered by the Java HotSpot VMs adaptive compiler
will not be present in this mode.</p>

<p>-Xbatch Disable background compilation. Normally the VM
will compile the method as a background task, running the
method in inter- preter mode until the background
compilation is finished. The -Xbatch flag disables
background compilation so that compila- tion of all methods
proceeds as a foreground task until com- pleted.</p>

<p>-Xbootclasspath:bootclasspath Specify a colon-separated
list of directories, JAR archives, and ZIP archives to
search for boot class files. These are used in place of the
boot class files included in the Java 2 SDK. Note:
Applications that use this option for the purpose of
overriding a class in rt.jar should not be deployed as doing
so would contravene the Java 2 Runtime Environment binary
code license.</p>

<p>-Xbootclasspath/a:path Specify a colon-separated path of
directires, JAR archives, and ZIP archives to append to the
default bootstrap class path.</p>

<p>-Xbootclasspath/p:path Specify a colon-separated path of
directires, JAR archives, and ZIP archives to prepend in
front of the default bootstrap class path. Note:
Applications that use this option for the purpose of
overriding a class in rt.jar should not be deployed as doing
so would contravene the Java 2 Runtime Environment binary
code license.</p>

<p>-Xcheck:jni Perform additional checks for Java Native
Interface (JNI) functions. Specifically, the Java Virtual
Machine validates the parameters passed to the JNI function
as well as the run- time environment data before processing
the JNI request. Any invalid data encountered indicates a
problem in the native code, and the Java Virtual Machine
will terminate with a fatal error in such cases. Expect a
performance degradation when this option is used.</p>

<p>-Xfuture Perform strict class-file format checks. For
purposes of back- wards compatibility, the default format
checks performed by the Java 2 SDKs virtual machine are no
stricter than the checks performed by 1.1.x versions of the
JDK software. The -Xfuture flag turns on stricter class-file
format checks that enforce closer conformance to the
class-file format specifica- tion. Developers are encouraged
to use this flag when develop- ing new code because the
stricter checks will become the default in future releases
of the Java application launcher.</p>

<p>-Xnoclassgc Disable class garbage collection. Use of
this option will pre- vent memory recovery from loaded
classes thus increasing over- all memory usage. This could
cause OutOfMemoryError to be thrown in some
applications.</p>

<p>-Xincgc Enable the incremental garbage collector. The
incremental garbage collector, which is off by default, will
reduce the occasional long garbage-collection pauses during
program exe- cution. The incremental garbage collector will
at times exe- cute concurrently with the program and during
such times will reduce the processor capacity available to
the program.</p>

<p>-Xloggc:file Report on each garbage collection event, as
with -verbose:gc, but log this data to file. In addition to
the information -verbose:gc gives, each reported event will
be preceeded by the time (in seconds) since the first
garbage-collection event.</p>

<p>Always use a local file system for storage of this file
to avoid stalling the JVM due to network latency. The file
may be trun- cated in the case of a full file system and
logging will continue on the truncated file. This option
overrides -verbose:gc if both are given on the command
line.</p>

<p>-Xmsn Specify the initial size, in bytes, of the memory
allocation pool. This value must be a multiple of 1024
greater than 1MB. Append the letter k or K to indicate
kilobytes, or m or M to indicate megabytes. The default
value is chosen at runtime based on system configuration.
For more information, see HotSpot Ergonomics Examples:</p>

<p>-Xms6291456 -Xms6144k -Xms6m</p>

<p>-Xmxn Specify the maximum size, in bytes, of the memory
allocation pool. This value must a multiple of 1024 greater
than 2MB. Append the letter k or K to indicate kilobytes, or
m or M to indicate megabytes. The default value is chosen at
runtime based on system configuration. For more information,
see HotSpot Ergonomics Examples:</p>

<p>-Xmx83886080 -Xmx81920k -Xmx80m</p>

<p>On Solaris 7 and Solaris 8 SPARC platforms, the upper
limit for this value is approximately 4000m minus overhead
amounts. On Solaris 2.6 and x86 platforms, the upper limit
is approximately 2000m minus overhead amounts. On Linux
platforms, the upper limit is approximately 2000m minus
overhead amounts.</p>

<p>-Xprof Profiles the running program, and sends profiling
data to standard output. This option is provided as a
utility that is useful in program development and is not
intended to be be used in production systems.</p>

<p>-Xrs Reduces use of operating-system signals by the Java
virtual machine (JVM).</p>

<p>In a previous release, the Shutdown Hooks facility was
added to allow orderly shutdown of a Java application. The
intent was to allow user cleanup code (such as closing
database connections) to run at shutdown, even if the JVM
terminates abruptly.</p>

<p>Suns JVM catches signals to implement shutdown hooks for
abnor- mal JVM termination. The JVM uses SIGHUP, SIGINT, and
SIGTERM to initiate the running of shutdown hooks.</p>

<p>The JVM uses a similar mechanism to implement the
pre-1.2 feature of dumping thread stacks for debugging
purposes. Sun s JVM uses SIGQUIT to perform thread
dumps.</p>

<p>Applications embedding the JVM frequently need to trap
signals like SIGINT or SIGTERM, which can lead to
interference with the JVMs own signal handlers. The -Xrs
command-line option is avail- able to address this issue.
When -Xrs is used on Sun s JVM, the signal masks for SIGINT,
SIGTERM, SIGHUP, and SIGQUIT are not changed by the JVM, and
signal handlers for these signals are not installed.</p>

<p>There are two consequences of specifying -Xrs:</p>

<p>o SIGQUIT thread dumps are not available.</p>

<p>o User code is responsible for causing shutdown hooks to
run, for example by calling System.exit() when the JVM is to
be terminated.</p>

<p>-Xssn Set thread stack size.</p>

<p>-XX:+UseAltSigs The VM uses SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 by
default, which can some- times conflict with applications
that signal-chain SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2. The -XX:+UseAltSigs
option will cause the VM to use signals other than SIGUSR1
and SIGUSR2 as the default.</p>

<p>NOTES The -version:release command line option places no
restrictions on the complexity of the release specification.
However, only a restricted subset of the possible release
specifications represent sound policy and only these are
fully supported. These policies are:</p>

<p>1. Any version, represented by not using this
option.</p>

<p>2. Any version greater than an arbitrarily precise
version-id. For example:</p>

<p>&quot;1.5.0_03+&quot;</p>

<p>Would utilize any version greater than 1.5.0_03. This is
useful for a case where an interface was introduced (or a
bug fixed) in the release specified.</p>

<p>3. A version greater than an arbitrarily precise
version-id, bounded by the upper bound of that release
family. For example:</p>

<p>&quot;1.5.0_03+&amp;1.5*&quot;</p>

<p>4. &quot;Or&quot; expressions of items 2. or 3. above.
For example:</p>

<p>&quot;1.4.2_05+&amp;1.4* 1.5+&quot;</p>

<p>Similar to item 2. this is useful when a change was
introduced in a release (1.5) but also made available in
updates to previous releases.</p>
