<p>ATTR_MULTI(3) XFS Compatibility API ATTR_MULTI(3)</p>

<p>NAME attr_multi, attr_multif - manipulate multiple user
attributes on a filesystem object at once</p>

<p>C SYNOPSIS #include &lt;attr/attributes.h&gt;</p>

<p>int attr_multi (const char *path, attr_multiop_t
*oplist, int count, int flags);</p>

<p>int attr_multif (int fd, attr_multiop_t *oplist, int
count, int flags);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The attr_multi and attr_multif functions
provide a way to operate on multiple attributes of a
filesystem object at once.</p>

<p>Path points to a path name for a filesystem object, and
fd refers to the file descriptor associated with a file. The
oplist is an array of attr_multiop_t structures. Each
element in that array describes a sin- gle attribute
operation and provides all the information required to carry
out that operation and to check for success or failure of
that operation. Count tells how many elements are in the
oplist array.</p>

<p>The contents of an attr_multiop_t structure include the
following mem- bers:</p>

<p>int am_opcode; /* which operation to perform (see below)
*/ int am_error; /* [out arg] result of this sub-op (an
errno) */ char *am_attrname; /* attribute name to work with
*/ char *am_attrvalue; /* [in/out arg] attribute value (raw
bytes) */ int am_length; /* [in/out arg] length of value */
int am_flags; /* flags (bit-wise OR of #defines below)
*/</p>

<p>The am_opcode field defines how the remaining fields are
to be inter- preted and can take on one of the following
values:</p>

<p>ATTR_OP_GET /* return the indicated attrs value */
ATTR_OP_SET /* set/create the indicated attr/value pair */
ATTR_OP_REMOVE /* remove the indicated attr */</p>

<p>The am_error field will contain the appropriate error
result code if that sub-operation fails. The result codes
for a given sub-operation are a subset of the result codes
that are possible from the correspond- ing single-attribute
function call. For example, the result code pos- sible from
an ATTR_OP_GET sub-operation are a subset of those that can
be returned from an attr_get function call.</p>

<p>The am_attrname field is a pointer to a NULL terminated
string giving the attribute name that the sub-operation
should operate on.</p>

<p>The am_attrvalue, am_length and am_flags fields are used
to store the value of the named attribute, and some control
flags for that sub-oper- ation, respectively. Their use
varies depending on the value of the am_opcode field.</p>

<p>ATTR_OP_GET The am_attrvalue field is a pointer to a
empty buffer that will be overwritten with the value of the
named attribute. The am_length field is initially the total
size of the memory buffer that the am_attrvalue field points
to. After the operation, the am_length field contains the
actual size of the attribute&acute;s value. The am_flags
field may be set to the ATTR_ROOT flag. If the process has
appropriate priviledges, the ROOT namespace will be searched
for the named attribute, otherwise the USER names- pace will
be searched.</p>

<p>ATTR_OP_SET The am_attrvalue and am_length fields
contain the new value for the given attribute name and its
length. The ATTR_ROOT flag may be set in the am_flags field.
If the process has appropriate priviledges, the ROOT
namespace will be searched for the named attribute,
otherwise the USER namespace will be searched. The
ATTR_CREATE and the ATTR_REPLACE flags may also be set in
the am_flags field (but not simultaneously). If the
ATTR_CREATE flag is set, the sub-operation will set the
am_error field to EEXIST if the named attribute already
exists. If the ATTR_REPLACE flag is set, the sub-operation
will set the am_error field to ENOATTR if the named
attribute does not already exist. If neither of those two
flags are set and the attribute does not exist, then the
attribute will be created with the given value. If neither
of those two flags are set and the attribute already exists,
then the value will be replaced with the given value.</p>

<p>ATTR_OP_REMOVE The am_attrvalue and am_length fields are
not used and are ignored. The am_flags field may be set to
the ATTR_ROOT flag. If the process has appropriate
priviledges, the ROOT namespace will be searched for the
named attribute, otherwise the USER namespace will be
searched.</p>

<p>The flags argument to the attr_multi call is used to
control following of symbolic links in the path argument.
The default is to follow sym- bolic links, flags should be
set to ATTR_DONTFOLLOW to not follow sym- bolic links.</p>

<p>attr_multi will fail if one or more of the following are
true:</p>

<p>[ENOENT] The named file does not exist.</p>

<p>[EPERM] The effective user ID does not match the owner
of the file and the effective user ID is not super-user.</p>

<p>[ENOTDIR] A component of the path prefix is not a
directory.</p>

<p>[EACCES] Search permission is denied on a component of
the path prefix.</p>

<p>[EINVAL] A bit other than ATTR_DONTFOLLOW was set in the
flag argument.</p>

<p>[EFAULT] Path, or oplist points outside the allocated
address space of the process.</p>

<p>[ELOOP] A path name lookup involved too many symbolic
links.</p>

<p>[ENAMETOOLONG] The length of path exceeds {MAXPATHLEN},
or a pathname component is longer than {MAXNAMELEN}.</p>

<p>attr_multif will fail if:</p>

<p>[EINVAL] A bit was set in the flag argument, or fd
refers to a socket, not a file.</p>

<p>[EFAULT] Oplist points outside the allocated address
space of the process.</p>

<p>[EBADF] Fd does not refer to a valid descriptor.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS On success, zero is returned. On error, -1
is returned, and errno is set appropriately. Note that the
individual operations listed in the oplist array each have
their own error return fields. The errno vari- able only
records the result of the attr_multi call itself, not the
result of any of the sub-operations.</p>
