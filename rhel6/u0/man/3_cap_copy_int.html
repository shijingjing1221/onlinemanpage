<p>CAP_COPY_EXT(3) Linux Programmer s Manual
CAP_COPY_EXT(3)</p>

<p>NAME cap_copy_ext, cap_size, cap_copy_int - capability
state external repre- sentation translation</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/capability.h&gt;</p>

<p>ssize_t cap_size(cap_t cap_p);</p>

<p>ssize_t cap_copy_ext(void *ext_p, cap_t cap_p, ssize_t
size);</p>

<p>cap_t cap_copy_int(const void *ext_p);</p>

<p>Link with -lcap.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION These functions translate between internal
and external representations of a capability state. The
external representation is an exportable, contiguous,
persistent representation of a capability state in user-
managed space. The internal representation is managed by the
capabil- ity functions in working storage.</p>

<p>cap_size() returns the total length (in bytes) that the
capability state in working storage identified by cap_p
would require when con- verted by cap_copy_ext(). This
function is used primarily to determine the amount of buffer
space that must be provided to the cap_copy_ext() function
in order to hold the capability data record created from
cap_p.</p>

<p>cap_copy_ext() copies a capability state in working
storage, identified by cap_p, from system managed space to
user-managed space (pointed to by ext_p) and returns the
length of the resulting data record. The size parameter
represents the maximum size, in bytes, of the resulting data
record. The cap_copy_ext() function will do any conversions
nec- essary to convert the capability state from the
undefined internal for- mat to an exportable, contiguous,
persistent data record. It is the responsibility of the user
to allocate a buffer large enough to hold the copied data.
The buffer length required to hold the copied data may be
obtained by a call to the cap_size() function.</p>

<p>cap_copy_int() copies a capability state from a
capability data record in user-managed space to a new
capability state in working storage, allocating any memory
necessary, and returning a pointer to the newly created
capability state. The function initializes the capability
state and then copies the capability state from the record
pointed to by ext_p into the capability state, converting,
if necessary, the data from a contiguous, persistent format
to an undefined, internal format. Once copied into internal
format, the object can be manipulated by the capability
state manipulation functions (see cap_clear(3)). Note that
the record pointed to by ext_p must have been obtained from
a previous, successful call to cap_copy_ext() for this
function to work success- fully. The caller should free any
releasable memory, when the capabil- ity state in working
storage is no longer required, by calling cap_free() with
the cap_t as an argument.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE cap_size() returns the length required to
hold a capability data record on success, and -1 on
failure.</p>

<p>cap_copy_ext() returns the number of bytes placed in the
user managed space pointed to by ext_p on success, and -1 on
failure.</p>

<p>cap_copy_int() returns a pointer to the newly created
capability state in working storage on success, and NULL on
failure.</p>

<p>On failure, errno is set to EINVAL, ENOMEM, or
ERANGE.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO These functions are specified in the
withdrawn POSIX.1e draft specifi- cation.</p>
