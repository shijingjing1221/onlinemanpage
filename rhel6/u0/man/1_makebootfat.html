Bootable FAT Disk Creation(1)</p>

<p>NAME makebootfat - Makebootfat Bootable FAT Disk
Creation</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS makebootfat [options] IMAGE</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This utility creates a bootable FAT
filesystem and populates it with files and boot tools.</p>

<p>It is mainly designed to create bootable USB and Fixed
disk for the AdvanceCD project.</p>

<p>The official site of AdvanceCD and makebootfat is:</p>

<p>http://advancemame.sourceforge.net/</p>

<p>OPTIONS -o, --output DEVICE Specify the output device.
It must be the device where you want to setup the
filesystem. You can use the special usb value to
automatically select the USB Mass Storage device connected
at the system. This option is always required.</p>

<p>-b, --boot FILE</p>

<p>-1, --boot-fat12 FILE</p>

<p>-2, --boot-fat16 FILE</p>

<p>-3, --boot-fat32 FILE Specify the FAT boot sector images
to use. The -b option uses the same sector for all the FAT
types. The other options can be used to specify a different
sector for different FAT types. The FAT types for which a
boot sector is not specified are not used. This option is
always required.</p>

<p>-m, --mbr FILE Specify the MBR sector image to use. If
this option is speci- fied a partition table is created on
the disk. Otherwise the disk is filled without a partition
table like a floppy disk.</p>

<p>-F, --mbrfat Change the MBR image specified with the -m
option to pretend to be a FAT filesystem starting from the
first sector of the disk. This allows booting from USB-FDD
(Floppy Disk Drive) also using a partition table generally
required by USB-HDD (Hard Disk Drive). The MBR image
specified with the -m option must have executable code
positioned like a FAT boot sector. You can use the included
mbrfat.bin file.</p>

<p>-c, --copy FILE Copy the specified file in the root
directory of the disk. The file is copied using the readonly
attribute.</p>

<p>-x, --exclude FILE Exclude the specified files and
subdirectories in the IMAGE directory to copy. The path must
be specified using the same format used in the IMAGE
directory specification.</p>

<p>-X, --syslinux2 Enforce the syslinux 2.xx FAT
limitations. Syslinux 2.xx doesnt support FAT32 at all, and
FAT16 with 64 and 128 sectors per cluster formats. This
option excludes all the FAT formats not supported by
syslinux. Please note that it limits the maximum size of
filesystem to 1 GB.</p>

<p>-Y, --syslinux3 Enforce the syslinux 3.xx FAT support.
Syslinux 3.00 supports all the FAT types and sizes but it
requires a special customisa- tion of the boot sector and of
the file ldlinux.sys. This option does this customisation
without the need to use the sys- linux installer if the
ldlinux.sys file is copied on disk with the -c option.</p>

<p>-Z, --zip If possible force the ZIP-Disk compatibility.
It sets a geometry of 32 sectors and 64 heads. It also uses
the 4 th partition entry in the partition table. It s
required to boot also in USB-ZIP mode.</p>

<p>-P, --partition Ensure to operate on a partition and not
on a disk.</p>

<p>-D, --disk Ensure to operate on a disk and not on a
partition.</p>

<p>-L, --label LABEL Set the FAT label. The label is a
string of 11 chars.</p>

<p>-O, --oem OEM Set the FAT OEM name. The OEM name is a
string of 11 chars.</p>

<p>-S, --serial SERIAL Set the FAT serial number. The
serial number is a 32 bit unsigned integer.</p>

<p>-E, --drive DRIVE Set the BIOS drive to setup in the FAT
boot sector. Generally this value is ignored by boot
sectors, with the exception of the FAT12 and FAT16 FreeDOS
boot sectors that require the correct value or the value 255
to force auto detection.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose Print some information on the device and
on the filesystem cre- ated.</p>

<p>-i, --interactive Show the errors in a message box. Only
for Windows.</p>

<p>-h, --help Print a short help.</p>

<p>-V, --version Print the version number.</p>

<p>IMAGE Directory image to copy on the disk. All the files
and subdirec- tories present in this directory are copied on
the disk.</p>

<p>DISKS AND PARTITIONS NAMES In Linux disk devices are
named /dev/hdX or /dev/sdX where X is a let- ter. Partition
devices are named /dev/hdXN or /dev/sdXN where X is a letter
and N a digit.</p>

<p>In Windows disk devices are named \.PhysicalDriveN where
N is a digit. Partition devices are named \. sometimes \.
and on all the USB Mass Storage devices without a partition
table.</p>

<p>SYSLINUX To make a bootable FAT using syslinux you must
use the -X option for syslinux version 2.xx or the -Y option
for syslinux version 3.xx. You must also copy in the root
directory of the disk the files: ldlinux.sys The syslinux
loader. syslinux.cfg The syslinux configuration file. linux
The Linux kernel image (the file name may be different).
initrd.img The initrd filesystem (the file name may be
different or missing).</p>

<p>You must also specify the ldlinux.bss boot sector with
the -b option and possibily the mbr.bin MBR sector with the
-m option. Both the sector images are present in the
syslinux package.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>makebootfat -o usb -Y -b ldlinux.bss -m mbr.bin -c
ldlinux.sys -c syslinux.cfg -c linux -c initrd.img image</p>

<p>LOADLIN AND FREEDOS To make a bootable FAT using loadlin
and FreeDOS you must copy in the root directory of the disk
the files: kernel.sys The FreeDOS kernel. Remember to use
the 32 kernel version to support FAT32. command.com The
FreeDOS shell. autoexec.bat Used to start loadlin.
loadlin.exe The loadlin executable. linux The Linux kernel
image (the file name may be different). initrd.img The
initrd filesystem (the file name may be different or
missing).</p>

<p>You must also specify the FreeDOS boot sectors available
on the FreeDOS sys source package with the -1, -2, -3
option. For the MBR you can use the sectors image available
on the FreeDOS fdisk source package.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>makebootfat -o /dev/hda1 -E 255 -1 fat12com.bin -2
fat16com.bin -3 fat32lba.bin -c kernel.sys -c command.com -c
autoexec.bat -c loadlin.exe -c linux -c initrd.img image</p>

<p>MULTI STANDARD USB BOOTING The BIOS USB boot support is
generally differentiated in three cate- gories: USB-HDD,
USB-FDD and USB-ZIP.</p>

<p>The USB-HDD (Hard Disk Drive) standard is the preferred
choice and it requires the presence of a partition table in
the first sector of the disk. You can create this type of
disk using the -m option.</p>

<p>The USB-FDD (Floppy Disk Drive) standard requires the
presence of a filesystem starting from the first sector of
the disk without a parti- tion table. You can create this
type of disk without using the -m option.</p>

<p>The USB-ZIP (ZIP Drive) standard requires the presence
of a device with a very specific geometry. Specifically, it
requires a geometry with 32 sectors and 64 heads. It also
requires the presence of a partition ta- ble with only a
bootable partition in the fourth entry. You can create this
type of disk using the -m and -Z option.</p>

<p>Generally these standards are incompatible, but using
the -m, -F and -Z options you can create a disk compatible
with all of them.</p>

<p>To use the -F option, the MBR image specified must
follow the constrains: &middot; It must start with a
standard FAT 3 bytes jump instruction. &middot; It must have
the bytes from address 3 to 89 (included) unused.</p>

<p>And example of such image is in the mbrfat.bin file.</p>

<p>For example to create a syslinux image:</p>

<p>makebootfat -o usb -Y -Z -b ldlinux.bss -m mbrfat.bin -F
-c ldlinux.sys -c syslinux.cfg -c linux -c initrd.img
image</p>

<p>and for a FreeDOS and loadlin image:</p>

<p>makebootfat -o usb -E 255 -Z -1 fat12com.bin -2
fat16com.bin -3 fat32chs.bin -m mbrfat.bin -F -c kernel.sys
-c command.com -c autoexec.bat -c loadlin.exe -c linux -c
initrd.img image</p>

<p>Please note that FreeDos has some problems booting from
USB. It works only on very few conditions.</p>

<p>EXCLUSION To exclude some files or directories in the
image copy, you can use the -x option using the same path
specification which are you using for the image
directory.</p>

<p>For example, if you need to exclude the isolinux and
syslinux sub- directories from the image directory you can
use the command:</p>

<p>makebootfat ... -x image/isolinux -x image/syslinux
image</p>
