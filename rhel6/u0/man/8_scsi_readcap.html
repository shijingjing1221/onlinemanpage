<p>SCSI_READCAP(8) SG3_UTILS SCSI_READCAP(8)</p>

<p>NAME scsi_readcap - do SCSI READ CAPACITY command on
disks</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS scsi_readcap [--brief] [--help] [--long]
[--verbose] DEVICE [DEVICE]*</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This bourne shell script calls the
sg_readcap utility on each given DEVICE. This will send a
SCSI READ CAPACITY command to each DEVICE.</p>

<p>The default action of this script is to send the 10 byte
cdb READ CAPACITY(10) command to each DEVICE. If a response
indicates the number of blocks is greater than or equal to
2**32 - 1 then the READ CAPAC- ITY(16) is sent and its
response is output.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Arguments to long options are mandatory for
short options as well.</p>

<p>-b, --brief shortens the output to two hexadecimal
numbers, both prefixed by 0x. The first number is the number
of blocks available and the second is the size of each
blocks in bytes (e.g. 0x12a19eb0 0x200). If an error is
detected 0x0 0x0 is output and the script continues if there
are more DEVICEs.</p>

<p>-h, --help print out the usage message then exit.</p>

<p>-l, --long the default is to send the READ CAPACITY(10)
command (i.e. the 10 byte cdb variant). When this option is
given the READ CAPAC- ITY(16) command is sent. The latter
command yields more informa- tion in its response.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose increase level or verbosity.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The exit status of this script is 0 when it
is successful. Otherwise the exit status is that of the last
sg_readcap utility called. See the sg3_utils(8) man
page.</p>
