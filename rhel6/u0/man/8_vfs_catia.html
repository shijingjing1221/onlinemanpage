<p>NAME vfs_catia - translate illegal characters in Catia
filenames</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS vfs objects = catia</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This VFS module is part of the samba(7)
suite.</p>

<p>The Catia CAD package commonly creates filenames that
use characters that are illegal in CIFS filenames. The
vfs_catia VFS module implements a fixed character mapping so
that these files can be shared with CIFS clients.</p>

<p>This module is stackable.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Map Catia filenames on the [CAD] share:</p>

<p>[CAD] path = /data/cad vfs objects = catia</p>

<p>VERSION This man page is correct for version 3.0.25 of
the Samba suite.</p>

<p>AUTHOR The original Samba software and related utilities
were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by
the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way
the Linux kernel is developed.</p>
