<p>NAME co - check out RCS revisions</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS co [options] file ...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION co retrieves a revision from each RCS file
and stores it into the cor- responding working file.</p>

<p>Pathnames matching an RCS suffix denote RCS files; all
others denote working files. Names are paired as explained
in ci(1).</p>

<p>Revisions of an RCS file can be checked out locked or
unlocked. Lock- ing a revision prevents overlapping updates.
A revision checked out for reading or processing (e.g.,
compiling) need not be locked. A revision checked out for
editing and later checkin must normally be locked. Checkout
with locking fails if the revision to be checked out is
currently locked by another user. (A lock can be broken with
rcs(1).) Checkout with locking also requires the caller to
be on the access list of the RCS file, unless he is the
owner of the file or the superuser, or the access list is
empty. Checkout without locking is not subject to accesslist
restrictions, and is not affected by the presence of
locks.</p>

<p>A revision is selected by options for revision or branch
number, checkin date/time, author, or state. When the
selection options are applied in combination, co retrieves
the latest revision that satisfies all of them. If none of
the selection options is specified, co retrieves the latest
revision on the default branch (normally the trunk, see the
-b option of rcs(1)). A revision or branch number can be
attached to any of the options -f, -I, -l, -M, -p, -q, -r,
or -u. The options -d (date), -s (state), and -w (author)
retrieve from a sin- gle branch, the selected branch, which
is either specified by one of -f, ..., -u, or the default
branch.</p>

<p>A co command applied to an RCS file with no revisions
creates a zero- length working file. co always performs
keyword substitution (see below).</p>

<p>OPTIONS -r[rev] retrieves the latest revision whose
number is less than or equal to rev. If rev indicates a
branch rather than a revision, the latest revision on that
branch is retrieved. If rev is omitted, the latest revision
on the default branch (see the -b option of rcs(1)) is
retrieved. If rev is $, co determines the revision number
from keyword values in the working file. Otherwise, a
revision is composed of one or more numeric or symbolic
fields separated by periods. If rev begins with a period,
then the default branch (normally the trunk) is prepended to
it. If rev is a branch number followed by a period, then the
latest revi- sion on that branch is used. The numeric
equivalent of a sym- bolic field is specified with the -n
option of the commands ci(1) and rcs(1).</p>

<p>-l[rev] same as -r, except that it also locks the
retrieved revision for the caller.</p>

<p>-u[rev] same as -r, except that it unlocks the retrieved
revision if it was locked by the caller. If rev is omitted,
-u retrieves the revision locked by the caller, if there is
one; otherwise, it retrieves the latest revision on the
default branch.</p>

<p>-f[rev] forces the overwriting of the working file;
useful in connection with -q. See also FILE MODES below.</p>

<p>-kkv Generate keyword strings using the default form,
e.g. $Revision: 5.13 $ for the Revision keyword. A lockers
name is inserted in the value of the Header, Id, and Locker
keyword strings only as a file is being locked, i.e. by ci
-l and co -l. This is the default.</p>

<p>-kkvl Like -kkv, except that a lockers name is always
inserted if the given revision is currently locked.</p>

<p>-kk Generate only keyword names in keyword strings; omit
their val- ues. See KEYWORD SUBSTITUTION below. For example,
for the Revision keyword, generate the string $Revision$
instead of $Revision: 5.13 $. This option is useful to
ignore differences due to keyword substitution when
comparing different revisions of a file. Log messages are
inserted after $Log$ keywords even if -kk is specified,
since this tends to be more useful when merging changes.</p>

<p>-ko Generate the old keyword string, present in the
working file just before it was checked in. For example, for
the Revision keyword, generate the string $Revision: 1.1 $
instead of $Revi- sion: 5.13 $ if that is how the string
appeared when the file was checked in. This can be useful
for file formats that cannot tolerate any changes to
substrings that happen to take the form of keyword
strings.</p>

<p>-kb Generate a binary image of the old keyword string.
This acts like -ko, except it performs all working file
input and output in binary mode. This makes little
difference on Posix and Unix hosts, but on DOS-like hosts
one should use rcs -i -kb to ini- tialize an RCS file
intended to be used for binary files. Also, on all hosts,
rcsmerge(1) normally refuses to merge files when -kb is in
effect.</p>

<p>-kv Generate only keyword values for keyword strings.
For example, for the Revision keyword, generate the string
5.13 instead of $Revision: 5.13 $. This can help generate
files in programming languages where it is hard to strip
keyword delimiters like $Revision: $ from a string. However,
further keyword substitu- tion cannot be performed once the
keyword names are removed, so this option should be used
with care. Because of this danger of losing keywords, this
option cannot be combined with -l, and the owner write
permission of the working file is turned off; to edit the
file later, check it out again without -kv.</p>

<p>-p[rev] prints the retrieved revision on the standard
output rather than storing it in the working file. This
option is useful when co is part of a pipe.</p>

<p>-q[rev] quiet mode; diagnostics are not printed.</p>

<p>-I[rev] interactive mode; the user is prompted and
questioned even if the standard input is not a terminal.</p>

<p>-ddate retrieves the latest revision on the selected
branch whose checkin date/time is less than or equal to
date. The date and time can be given in free format. The
time zone LT stands for local time; other common time zone
names are understood. For example, the following dates are
equivalent if local time is January 11, 1990, 8pm Pacific
Standard Time, eight hours west of Coordinated Universal
Time (UTC):</p>

<p>8:00 pm lt 4:00 AM, Jan. 12, 1990 default is UTC
1990-01-12 04:00:00+00 ISO 8601 (UTC) 1990-01-11 20:00:00-08

RFC 822 12-January-1990, 04:00 WET</p>

<p>Most fields in the date and time can be defaulted. The
default time zone is normally UTC, but this can be
overridden by the -z option. The other defaults are
determined in the order year, month, day, hour, minute, and
second (most to least signifi- cant). At least one of these
fields must be provided. For omitted fields that are of
higher significance than the highest provided field, the
time zones current values are assumed. For all other omitted
fields, the lowest possible values are assumed. For example,
without -z, the date 20, 10:30 defaults to 10:30:00 UTC of
the 20th of the UTC time zone s current month and year. The
date/time must be quoted if it contains spaces.</p>

<p>-M[rev] Set the modification time on the new working
file to be the date of the retrieved revision. Use this
option with care; it can confuse make(1).</p>

<p>-sstate retrieves the latest revision on the selected
branch whose state is set to state.</p>

<p>-S Turns on same user locks. When this is enabled the
user cannot check out the same file twice.</p>

<p>-T Preserve the modification time on the RCS file even
if the RCS file changes because a lock is added or removed.
This option can suppress extensive recompilation caused by a
make(1) depen- dency of some other copy of the working file
on the RCS file. Use this option with care; it can suppress
recompilation even when it is needed, i.e. when the change
of lock would mean a change to keyword strings in the other
working file.</p>

<p>-w[login] retrieves the latest revision on the selected
branch which was checked in by the user with login name
login. If the argument login is omitted, the callers login
is assumed.</p>

<p>-jjoinlist generates a new revision which is the join of
the revisions on joinlist. This option is largely obsoleted
by rcsmerge(1) but is retained for backwards
compatibility.</p>

<p>The joinlist is a comma-separated list of pairs of the
form rev2:rev3, where rev2 and rev3 are (symbolic or
numeric) revi- sion numbers. For the initial such pair, rev1
denotes the revi- sion selected by the above options -f,
..., -w. For all other pairs, rev1 denotes the revision
generated by the previous pair. (Thus, the output of one
join becomes the input to the next.)</p>

<p>For each pair, co joins revisions rev1 and rev3 with
respect to rev2. This means that all changes that transform
rev2 into rev1 are applied to a copy of rev3. This is
particularly useful if rev1 and rev3 are the ends of two
branches that have rev2 as a common ancestor. If
rev1&lt;rev2&lt;rev3 on the same branch, joining generates a
new revision which is like rev3, but with all changes that
lead from rev1 to rev2 undone. If changes from rev2 to rev1
overlap with changes from rev2 to rev3, co reports overlaps
as described in merge(1).</p>

<p>For the initial pair, rev2 can be omitted. The default
is the common ancestor. If any of the arguments indicate
branches, the latest revisions on those branches are
assumed. The options -l and -u lock or unlock rev1.</p>

<p>-V Print RCSs version number.</p>

<p>-Vn Emulate RCS version n, where n can be 3, 4, or 5.
This can be useful when interchanging RCS files with others
who are running older versions of RCS. To see which version
of RCS your corre- spondents are running, have them invoke
rcs -V; this works with newer versions of RCS. If it doesnt
work, have them invoke rlog on an RCS file; if none of the
first few lines of output contain the string branch: it is
version 3; if the dates years have just two digits, it is
version 4; otherwise, it is version 5. An RCS file generated
while emulating version 3 loses its default branch. An RCS
revision generated while emulating ver- sion 4 or earlier
has a time stamp that is off by up to 13 hours. A revision
extracted while emulating version 4 or ear- lier contains
abbreviated dates of the form yy/mm/dd and can also contain
different white space and line prefixes in the sub-
stitution for $Log$.</p>

<p>-xsuffixes Use suffixes to characterize RCS files. See
ci(1) for details.</p>

<p>-zzone specifies the date output format in keyword
substitution, and specifies the default time zone for date
in the -ddate option. The zone should be empty, a numeric
UTC offset, or the special string LT for local time. The
default is an empty zone, which uses the traditional RCS
format of UTC without any time zone indication and with
slashes separating the parts of the date; otherwise, times
are output in ISO 8601 format with time zone indication. For
example, if local time is January 11, 1990, 8pm Pacific
Standard Time, eight hours west of UTC, then the time is
output as follows:</p>

<p>option time output -z 1990/01/12 04:00:00 (default) -zLT
1990-01-11 20:00:00-08 -z+05:30 1990-01-12
09:30:00+05:30</p>

<p>The -z option does not affect dates stored in RCS files,
which are always UTC.</p>

<p>KEYWORD SUBSTITUTION Strings of the form $keyword$ and
$keyword:...$ embedded in the text are replaced with strings
of the form $keyword:value$ where keyword and value are
pairs listed below. Keywords can be embedded in literal
strings or comments to identify a revision.</p>

<p>Initially, the user enters strings of the form
$keyword$. On checkout, co replaces these strings with
strings of the form $keyword:value$. If a revision
containing strings of the latter form is checked back in,
the value fields will be replaced during the next checkout.
Thus, the keyword values are automatically updated on
checkout. This automatic substitution can be modified by the
-k options.</p>

<p>Keywords and their corresponding values:</p>

<p>$Author$ The login name of the user who checked in the
revision.</p>

<p>$Date$ The date and time the revision was checked in.
With -zzone a numeric time zone offset is appended;
otherwise, the date is UTC.</p>

<p>$Header$ A standard header containing the full pathname
of the RCS file, the revision number, the date and time, the
author, the state, and the locker (if locked). With -zzone a
numeric time zone offset is appended to the date; otherwise,
the date is UTC.</p>

<p>$Id$ Same as $Header$, except that the RCS filename is
without a path.</p>

<p>$Locker$ The login name of the user who locked the
revision (empty if not locked).</p>

<p>$Log$ The log message supplied during checkin, preceded
by a header containing the RCS filename, the revision
number, the author, and the date and time. With -zzone a
numeric time zone offset is appended; otherwise, the date is
UTC. Existing log messages are not replaced. Instead, the
new log message is inserted after $Log:...$. This is useful
for accumulating a complete change log in a source file.</p>

<p>Each inserted line is prefixed by the string that
prefixes the $Log$ line. For example, if the $Log$ line is
// $Log: tan.cc $, RCS prefixes each line of the log with //
. This is useful for languages with comments that go to the
end of the line. The convention for other languages is to
use a pre- fix inside a multiline comment. For example, the
initial log comment of a C program conventionally is of the
following form:</p>

<p>/ $Log$ /</p>

<p>For backwards compatibility with older versions of RCS,
if the log prefix is / or ( surrounded by optional white
space, inserted log lines contain a space instead of / or (;
however, this usage is obsolescent and should not be relied
on.</p>

<p>$Name$ The symbolic name used to check out the revision,
if any. For example, co -rJoe generates $Name: Joe $. Plain
co generates just $Name: $.</p>

<p>$RCSfile$ The name of the RCS file without a path.</p>

<p>$Revision$ The revision number assigned to the
revision.</p>

<p>$Source$ The full pathname of the RCS file.</p>

<p>$State$ The state assigned to the revision with the -s
option of rcs(1) or ci(1).</p>

<p>The following characters in keyword values are
represented by escape sequences to keep keyword strings
well-formed.</p>

<p>char escape sequence tab t newline n space 040 $ 044
\FILE MODES The working file inherits the read and execute
permissions from the RCS file. In addition, the owner write
permission is turned on, unless -kv is set or the file is
checked out unlocked and locking is set to strict (see
rcs(1)).</p>

<p>If a file with the name of the working file exists
already and has write permission, co aborts the checkout,
asking beforehand if possi- ble. If the existing working
file is not writable or -f is given, the working file is
deleted without asking.</p>

<p>FILES co accesses files much as ci(1) does, except that
it does not need to read the working file unless a revision
number of $ is specified.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT RCSINIT options prepended to the argument
list, separated by spaces. See ci(1) for details.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS The RCS pathname, the working pathname, and
the revision number retrieved are written to the diagnostic
output. The exit status is zero if and only if all
operations were successful.</p>

<p>LIMITS Links to the RCS and working files are not

<p>There is no way to selectively suppress the expansion of
keywords, except by writing them differently. In nroff and

the keyword.</p>
