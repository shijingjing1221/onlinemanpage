<p>PAM_TIMESTAMP(8) Linux-PAM Manual PAM_TIMESTAMP(8)</p>

<p>NAME pam_timestamp - Authenticate using cached
successful authentication attempts</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pam_timestamp.so [timestamp_timeout=number]
[verbose] [debug]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION In a nutshell, pam_timestamp caches
successful authentication attempts, and allows you to use a
recent successful attempt as the basis for authentication.
This is similar mechanism which is used in sudo.</p>

<p>When an application opens a session using pam_timestamp,
a timestamp file is created in the timestampdir directory
for the user. When an application attempts to authenticate
the user, a pam_timestamp will treat a sufficiently recent
timestamp file as grounds for succeeding.</p>

<p>OPTIONS timestamp_timeout=number How long should
pam_timestamp treat timestamp as valid after their last
modification date (in seconds). Default is 300 seconds.</p>

<p>verbose Attempt to inform the user when access is
granted.</p>

<p>debug Turns on debugging messages sent to syslog(3).</p>

<p>MODULE TYPES PROVIDED The auth and session module types
are provided.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUES PAM_AUTH_ERR The module was not able to
retrieve the user name or no valid timestamp file was
found.</p>

<p>PAM_SUCCESS Everything was successful.</p>

<p>PAM_SESSION_ERR Timestamp file could not be created or
updated.</p>

<p>NOTES Users can get confused when they are not always
asked for passwords when running a given program. Some users
reflexively begin typing information before noticing that it
is not being asked for.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES auth sufficient pam_timestamp.so verbose auth
required pam_unix.so</p>

<p>session required pam_unix.so session optional
pam_timestamp.so</p>

<p>FILES /var/run/sudo/... timestamp files and
directories</p>
