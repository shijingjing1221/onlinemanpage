<p>ISDNCONF(1) Linux System Utilities ISDNCONF(1)</p>

<p>NAME isdnconf - manipulate or read ISDN phone number
config files.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS isdnconf</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION isdnconf can manipulate or read the file
/etc/isdn/callerid.conf as well as ~/.isdn. Entries can be
added or removed from these files. Additionally, entries can
be searched for and displayed in a way simi- lar to grep. An
entry can be an own MSN ([MSN]) or a phone number
([NUMBER]).</p>

<p>You can use this program to build your own phonebook.
These files are used by many of the other ISDN utilities
that use phone numbers, to display a number symbolicly
instead of as a plain number.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Note: usage of the options -A and -D is
dangerous! The complete struc- ture of the file may be
changed, and all comments are removed! Make backups of your
data files before trying these.</p>

<p>COMMAND OPTIONS:</p>

<p>-A Add a new entry, which is read from standard input.
The following values are asked for (here with examples):</p>

<p>Alias: Fred Number: 0815/441777 SI: 0 Zone: 4 Interface:
- Flags: I|O Program: /usr/local/bin/ring User: uucp Group:
user Interval: Time: 8-20 Flags: (control-D here indicates
end of flags)</p>

<p>Alias: (control-D here indicated end of entries)</p>

<p>If you want another [Flags] entry, simply enter the data
for another program for this number at the point where the
control-D was given above.</p>

<p>If you want to add another number, simply enter the data
for the next number at the Alias prompt.</p>

<p>You can also pipe the data into this program; the input
data then must correspond to the prompts that the program
gives! Note that you can only add one number at a time then
(theres no way of telling isdnconf that you want to stop
giving Flags info and start giving the next Alias info).</p>

<p>-D Delete one or more entries which match the data
options given. How to supply the data to match is discussed
below (see DATA OPTIONS).</p>

<p>-V version: display the programs version and
terminate.</p>

<p>If both -A and -D are given together, isdnconf will
terminate, as this is not a valid combination.</p>

<p>If neither -A nor -D is given, then isdnconf will
display entries which match the data given.</p>

<p>DATA OPTIONS: (none applicable for -A)</p>

<p>-nnumber number: match the given number. It can contain
wildcards.</p>

<p>-aalias alias: match the given alias name. The name can
contain wildcards. Note: due to a bug, use ? instead of
-.</p>

<p>-tSI SI: match the given service indicator.</p>

<p>-ccode code: match the area code of the phone number.
Only usable for dis- playing (not for -A nor -D).</p>

<p>-i ignore case for the -n and -a options.</p>

<p>-w word: the parameters for -n and -a must match the
whole value, not just a substring. Examples (here for
-n):</p>

<p>&quot;*34*&quot; matches 123456, 345677, 1234
&quot;34*&quot; matches 34567, 34111 but not 1234
&quot;34??&quot; matches 3411, 3456 &quot;34&quot; matches
only 34</p>

<p>Without the -w option, these would match:</p>

<p>&quot;*34*&quot; matches 123456, 345677, 1234
&quot;34*&quot; matches 123456, 345677, 1234, 34567, 34111
&quot;34??&quot; matches 123456, 345677, 1234, 3411, 3456
&quot;34&quot; matches 123456, 345677, 1234, 3411, 3456,
34567</p>

<p>-d and: by default the values given to options -n, -a
and -t will be combined with a logical OR. If these should
be combined with a log- ical AND (which is probably what
most people expect!) you must use this -d option. In this
case you can only supply each of the -n, -a and -t options
exactly once.</p>

<p>OTHER OPTIONS:</p>

<p>-q quiet: when using the -A or -D commands, the output
is suppressed. When not using the -A or -D commands, only
the alias of the match- ing number is shown, or just the
number in case the alias is not found.</p>

<p>-m MSN: when used in combination with the -A command,
instructs isd- nconf to create a new MSN entry; the default
is to create a new NUMBER entry. Only the values alias,
number, SI, zone and interface are applicable to an MSN
entry.</p>

<p>The following two options do not apply to the -A and -D
commands. They only change the output format.</p>

<p>-s short: only display the alias and the number.</p>

<p>-l long: also display the programs to run ([START]).</p>

<p>-ffilename file: usually isdnconf uses the
/etc/isdn/callerid.conf and the ~/.isdn files. If isdnconf
should be applied to another file, use this option.</p>

<p>-g global: only applies to the -A and -D commands.
Instead of editing ~/.isdn, /etc/isdn/callerid.conf is
edited.</p>

<p>-1 first: only delete or display the first entry.</p>

<p>-M isdnmon: used internally by isdnmon to get alias
info.</p>
