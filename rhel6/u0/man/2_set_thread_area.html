<p>SET_THREAD_AREA(2) Linux Programmer s Manual
SET_THREAD_AREA(2)</p>

<p>NAME set_thread_area - Set a Thread Local Storage (TLS)
area</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;linux/unistd.h&gt; #include
&lt;asm/ldt.h&gt;</p>

<p>int set_thread_area(struct user_desc *u_info);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION set_thread_area() sets an entry in the
current thread s Thread Local Storage (TLS) array. The TLS
array entry set by set_thread_area() cor- responds to the
value of u_info-&gt;entry_number passed in by the user. If
this value is in bounds, set_thread_area() copies the TLS
descriptor pointed to by u_info into the threads TLS
array.</p>

<p>When set_thread_area() is passed an entry_number of -1,
it uses a free TLS entry. If set_thread_area() finds a free
TLS entry, the value of u_info-&gt;entry_number is set upon
return to show which entry was changed.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE set_thread_area() returns 0 on success, and
-1 on failure, with errno set appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS EINVAL u_info-&gt;entry_number is out of
bounds.</p>

<p>EFAULT u_info is an invalid pointer.</p>

<p>ESRCH A free TLS entry could not be located.</p>

<p>VERSIONS A version of set_thread_area() first appeared
in Linux 2.5.29.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO set_thread_area() is Linux-specific and
should not be used in programs that are intended to be
portable.</p>

<p>NOTES Glibc does not provide a wrapper for this
function; call it using syscall(2).</p>
