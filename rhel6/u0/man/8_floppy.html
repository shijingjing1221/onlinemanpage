<p>NAME floppy - format floppy disks</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS floppy [ --createrc &gt;/etc/floppy | --format
/dev/fdo | --format A: ]</p>

<p>floppygtk</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The floppy utility does low-level formatting
of floppy disks. floppy uses a simple interface for
formatting disks in floppy controller drives and in ATAPI
IDE floppy drives, such as LS-120 &quot;Superdisk&quot;
drives. ATAPI IDE support requires a patch to the Linux
kernel. Without a patched kernel floppy can only format
disks in floppy controller drives.</p>

<p>Note: Use caution in formatting anything other than
standard 3.5&quot; 1.4MB floppy disks in ATAPI IDE floppy
drives. Most LS-120 drives, for example, accept a request to
format 120MB high den- sity disks, but most 120MB disks are
not designed to be format- ted. Low-level formatting will
ruin them permanently.</p>

<p>floppygtk is a GTK interface to the floppy utility. If
started from an X terminal window, floppy automatically runs
floppygtk.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --probe, -p Probe for available floppy drives.
floppy creates and displays a list of all detected floppy
drives.</p>

<p>--createrc, -r Print a configuration file. floppy prints
on standard output the results of the --probe option in a
configuration file format. This configuration file should be
saved as /etc/floppy.</p>

<p>--showrc List floppy drives configured in
/etc/floppy.</p>

<p>--capacity, -c Show the available format capacities of
the floppy drive. Most floppy drives can format disks of
different capacities. --capac- ity lists each available
format capacity as CxBxS where: C - number of cylinders, B -
blocks per cylinder, S - block size, in bytes. --capacity
also calculates how much that is, in kilo- bytes
ormegabytes.</p>

<p>--format, -f Format the disk in the floppy drive.</p>

<p>--size=CxBxS, -s=CxBxS Specify the size of the disk to
format. --format uses the first format capacity reported by
--capacity if the --size option is not specified.</p>

<p>--ext2 Create an ext2 (Linux) filesystem on the
formatted floppy. This option requires the e2fsprogs package
to be installed. This option runs mke2fs after formatting
the floppy disk.</p>

<p>--fat Create a FAT (DOS) filesystem on the formatted
floppy. This option requires the dosfstools package to be
installed. This option runs mkdosfs after formatting the
floppy disk.</p>

<p>--noprompt, -n Suppress verbose output produced by
--capacity and --format. Use a raw output format that can be
used by a front-end wrapper that runs floppy on the
back-end.</p>

<p>--eject Eject the floppy from the drive (IDE floppy
drives with an elec- tronic eject mechanism).</p>

<p>PROBING FOR AVAILABLE FLOPPY DRIVES floppy --probe</p>

<p>This command probes the hardware and reports on the
available floppy drives. A typical output from --probe would
be:</p>

<p>floppy 0.16 Copyright 2001-2003, Double Precision,
Inc.</p>

<p>floppy /dev/fd0: 3.5&quot; HD idefloppy /dev/hda: LS-120
VER5 00 UHD Floppy Revision: F523M5A9 Serial number:
9803M9A03464</p>

<p>Here, floppy detected a high density floppy drive on
/dev/fd0, and an IDE floppy drive on /dev/hda.</p>

<p>CREATING A CONFIGURATION FILE A configuration file,
/etc/floppy must be created before floppy can format floppy
disks. This configuration file can be created automati-
cally by the --createrc option. Each line in the
configuration file contains the following information:
type&lt;TAB&gt;label&lt;TAB&gt;device.
&quot;&lt;TAB&gt;&quot; is a single ASCII TAB character.
&quot;device&quot; is the device entry for the floppy drive.
floppy requires that all requests for formatting flop- pies
must use only the devices that appear in this configuration
file. &quot;label&quot; is an alias for this device. floppy
accepts &quot;label:&quot; instead of the actual device
entry, for example: &quot;floppy --format A:&quot;.
&quot;type&quot; is either &quot;floppy&quot; or
&quot;idefloppy&quot;.</p>

<p>The --createrc option sets &quot;A&quot; as the label
for the first floppy drive, and &quot;B&quot; for the second
floppy drive. If --createrc finds more than two floppy
drives, --createrc will use &quot;FA&quot;, &quot;FB&quot;,
&quot;FC&quot;, and so on.</p>

<p>DETERMINING AVAILABLE FORMAT CAPACITIES Most floppy
drives can format disks of different capacities. The
--capacity option shows possible format capacities on the
specified floppy device. A typical IDE floppy drive may
report the following capacities:</p>

<p>$ floppy --capacity B: Formattable capacities for
/dev/hda: 80x36x512 (1.40 Mb) 80x30x512 (1.17 Mb) 56x22x1024
(1.20 Mb)</p>

<p>A standard floppy drive attached to the floppy
controller may report the following capacities:</p>

<p>$ floppy --capacity A: Formattable capacities for
/dev/fd0: 80x36x512 (/dev/fd0H1440, 1.40 Mb) 80x18x512
(/dev/fd0D720, 720 Kb) 80x48x512 (/dev/fd0u1920, 1.87 Mb)
80x28x512 (/dev/fd0u1120, 1.09 Mb) 80x40x512 (/dev/fd0u1660,
1.56 Mb) 80x26x512 (/dev/fd0u1040, 1.01 Mb) 80x46x512
(/dev/fd0u1840, 1.79 Mb) 80x42x512 (/dev/fd0u1680, 1.64
Mb)</p>

<p>The --capacity option reports each available format
capacity as &quot;cylin- ders x blocks-per-cylinder x block
size&quot;. IDE floppy drive only return a total block
count, and --capacity tries some common blocks-per-cylin-
der geometries, until it finds one that fits. Format
capacities of standard floppy drives are obtained from the
floppy device driver.</p>

<p>Note:</p>

<p>IDE floppy drives may report format capacities only
after a disk is inserted. Without a floppy disk, IDE floppy
drives may not report any available format capacities, or
they may report the primary format capacity that they are
designed to format. For example, most LS-120 drives default
to reporting 120mb when there is no disk inserted in the
drive:</p>

<p>$ floppy --capacity A: Formattable capacities for
/dev/hda: 6848x36x512 (120.37 Mb)</p>

<p>Warning: Do not attempt to format 120Mb media in LS-120
drives. Most LS-120 disks are not user-formattable. They are
factory- formatted, and attempts to format them in LS-120
drives will render them unusable (to be sure, check the
label on the floppy itself). The floppy utility does not
prevent one from trying to use any format capacity the IDE
floppy drive claims to support. If the drive claims it can
format a disk of the given capacity, floppy will oblige.</p>

<p>FORMATTING The --format option does a low-level format
on the floppy.</p>

<p>$ ./floppy --format --size=80x36x512 A: Formatting 1.40
Mb... 0%</p>

<p>--size must specify a geometry returned by --capacity.
If --size is absent, the first geometry is selected.</p>

<p>For floppy controller drives, the status counter will go
from 0% to 100%. With most IDE floppy drives the counter
will remain at 0% until the format finishes. Some IDE floppy
drives are capable of reporting format progress status,
which will would allow --format to count up from 0% to
100%.</p>

<p>$ ./floppy --format --verify A:</p>

<p>The --verify option verifies the low-level format. For
floppy con- troller drives, the floppy disk is read from
start to finish, after the low-level format concludes. For
IDE floppy drives, the format request to the drive sets a
flag that that requests low-level format verifica- tion.</p>

<p>Note: Some IDE floppy drives ignore the verify request,
or always verify low-level formats, whether or not it was
requested.</p>

<p>$ ./floppy --format -V A:</p>

<p>The -V option is like --verify except that IDE floppy
drive formats are verified manually - like floppy controller
drive formats - by reading the floppy disk from start to
finish.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/floppy The configuration file.</p>

<p>/dev/fd[0-7] Floppy controller drives.</p>

<p>/dev/hd[a-h] ATAPI IDE floppy drives.</p>
