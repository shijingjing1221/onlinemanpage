<p>EXEC(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual EXEC(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME environ, execl, execv, execle, execve, execlp,
execvp - execute a file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>extern char **environ; int execl(const char *path, const
char *arg0, ... /*, (char *)0 */); int execv(const char
*path, char *const argv[]); int execle(const char *path,
const char *arg0, ... /*, (char *)0, char *const envp[]*/);
int execve(const char *path, char *const argv[], char *const
envp[]); int execlp(const char *file, const char *arg0, ...
/*, (char *)0 */); int execvp(const char *file, char *const
argv[]);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The exec family of functions shall replace
the current process image with a new process image. The new
image shall be constructed from a regular, executable file
called the new process image file. There shall be no return
from a successful exec, because the calling process image is
overlaid by the new process image.</p>

<p>When a C-language program is executed as a result of
this call, it shall be entered as a C-language function call
as follows:</p>

<p>int main (int argc, char *argv[]);</p>

<p>where argc is the argument count and argv is an array of
character pointers to the arguments themselves. In addition,
the following vari- able:</p>

<p>extern char **environ;</p>

<p>is initialized as a pointer to an array of character
pointers to the environment strings. The argv and environ
arrays are each terminated by a null pointer. The null
pointer terminating the argv array is not counted in
argc.</p>

<p>Conforming multi-threaded applications shall not use the
environ vari- able to access or modify any environment
variable while any other thread is concurrently modifying
any environment variable. A call to any function dependent
on any environment variable shall be considered a use of the
environ variable to access that environment variable.</p>

<p>The arguments specified by a program with one of the
exec functions shall be passed on to the new process image
in the corresponding main() arguments.</p>

<p>The argument path points to a pathname that identifies
the new process image file.</p>

<p>The argument file is used to construct a pathname that
identifies the new process image file. If the file argument
contains a slash character, the file argument shall be used
as the pathname for this file. Otherwise, the path prefix
for this file is obtained by a search of the directories
passed as the environment variable PATH (see the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Chapter 8,
Environment Variables). If this environment variable is not
present, the results of the search are
implementation-defined.</p>

<p>There are two distinct ways in which the contents of the
process image file may cause the execution to fail,
distinguished by the setting of errno to either [ENOEXEC] or
[EINVAL] (see the ERRORS section). In the cases where the
other members of the exec family of functions would fail and
set errno to [ENOEXEC], the execlp() and execvp() functions
shall execute a command interpreter and the environment of
the executed command shall be as if the process invoked the
sh utility using execl() as follows:</p>

<p>execl(&lt;shell path&gt;, arg0, file, arg1, ..., (char
*)0);</p>

<p>where &lt;shell path&gt; is an unspecified pathname for
the sh utility, file is the process image file, and for
execvp(), where arg0, arg1, and so on correspond to the
values passed to execvp() in argv[0], argv[1], and so
on.</p>

<p>The arguments represented by arg0,... are pointers to
null-terminated character strings. These strings shall
constitute the argument list available to the new process
image. The list is terminated by a null pointer. The
argument arg0 should point to a filename that is associ-
ated with the process being started by one of the exec
functions.</p>

<p>The argument argv is an array of character pointers to
null-terminated strings. The application shall ensure that
the last member of this array is a null pointer. These
strings shall constitute the argument list available to the
new process image. The value in argv[0] should point to a
filename that is associated with the process being started
by one of the exec functions.</p>

<p>The argument envp is an array of character pointers to
null-terminated strings. These strings shall constitute the
environment for the new process image. The envp array is
terminated by a null pointer.</p>

<p>For those forms not containing an envp pointer (
execl(), execv(), exe- clp(), and execvp()), the environment
for the new process image shall be taken from the external
variable environ in the calling process.</p>

<p>The number of bytes available for the new process
combined argument and environment lists is {ARG_MAX}. It is
implementation-defined whether null terminators, pointers,
and/or any alignment bytes are included in this total.</p>

<p>File descriptors open in the calling process image shall
remain open in the new process image, except for those whose
close-on- exec flag FD_CLOEXEC is set. For those file
descriptors that remain open, all attributes of the open
file description remain unchanged. For any file descriptor
that is closed for this reason, file locks are removed as a
result of the close as described in close(). Locks that are
not removed by closing of file descriptors remain
unchanged.</p>

<p>If file descriptors 0, 1, and 2 would otherwise be
closed after a suc- cessful call to one of the exec family
of functions, and the new pro- cess image file has the
set-user-ID or set-group-ID file mode bits set, and the
ST_NOSUID bit is not set for the file system containing the
new process image file, implementations may open an
unspecified file for each of these file descriptors in the
new process image.</p>

<p>Directory streams open in the calling process image
shall be closed in the new process image.</p>

<p>The state of the floating-point environment in the new
process image shall be set to the default.</p>

<p>The state of conversion descriptors and message catalog
descriptors in the new process image is undefined. For the
new process image, the equivalent of:</p>

<p>setlocale(LC_ALL, &quot;C&quot;)</p>

<p>shall be executed at start-up.</p>

<p>Signals set to the default action (SIG_DFL) in the
calling process image shall be set to the default action in
the new process image. Except for SIGCHLD, signals set to be
ignored (SIG_IGN) by the calling process image shall be set
to be ignored by the new process image. Sig- nals set to be
caught by the calling process image shall be set to the
default action in the new process image (see
&lt;signal.h&gt;). If the SIGCHLD signal is set to be
ignored by the calling process image, it is unspecified
whether the SIGCHLD signal is set to be ignored or to the
default action in the new process image. After a successful
call to any of the exec functions, alternate signal stacks
are not preserved and the SA_ONSTACK flag shall be cleared
for all signals.</p>

<p>After a successful call to any of the exec functions,
any functions previously registered by atexit() are no
longer registered.</p>

<p>If the ST_NOSUID bit is set for the file system
containing the new pro- cess image file, then the effective
user ID, effective group ID, saved set-user-ID, and saved
set-group-ID are unchanged in the new process image.
Otherwise, if the set-user-ID mode bit of the new process
image file is set, the effective user ID of the new process
image shall be set to the user ID of the new process image
file. Similarly, if the set-group-ID mode bit of the new
process image file is set, the effec- tive group ID of the
new process image shall be set to the group ID of the new
process image file. The real user ID, real group ID, and
sup- plementary group IDs of the new process image shall
remain the same as those of the calling process image. The
effective user ID and effective group ID of the new process
image shall be saved (as the saved set- user-ID and the
saved set-group-ID) for use by setuid().</p>

<p>Any shared memory segments attached to the calling
process image shall not be attached to the new process
image.</p>

<p>Any named semaphores open in the calling process shall
be closed as if by appropriate calls to sem_close().</p>

<p>Any blocks of typed memory that were mapped in the
calling process are unmapped, as if munmap() was implicitly
called to unmap them.</p>

<p>Memory locks established by the calling process via
calls to mlockall() or mlock() shall be removed. If locked
pages in the address space of the calling process are also
mapped into the address spaces of other processes and are
locked by those processes, the locks established by the
other processes shall be unaffected by the call by this
process to the exec function. If the exec function fails,
the effect on memory locks is unspecified.</p>

<p>Memory mappings created in the process are unmapped
before the address space is rebuilt for the new process
image.</p>

<p>For the SCHED_FIFO and SCHED_RR scheduling policies, the
policy and priority settings shall not be changed by a call
to an exec function. For other scheduling policies, the
policy and priority settings on exec are
implementation-defined.</p>

<p>Per-process timers created by the calling process shall
be deleted before replacing the current process image with
the new process image.</p>

<p>All open message queue descriptors in the calling
process shall be closed, as described in mq_close().</p>

<p>Any outstanding asynchronous I/O operations may be
canceled. Those asynchronous I/O operations that are not
canceled shall complete as if the exec function had not yet
occurred, but any associated signal noti- fications shall be
suppressed. It is unspecified whether the exec func- tion
itself blocks awaiting such I/O completion. In no event,
however, shall the new process image created by the exec
function be affected by the presence of outstanding
asynchronous I/O operations at the time the exec function is
called. Whether any I/O is canceled, and which I/O may be
canceled upon exec, is implementation-defined.</p>

<p>The new process image shall inherit the CPU-time clock
of the calling process image. This inheritance means that
the process CPU-time clock of the process being exec-ed
shall not be reinitialized or altered as a result of the
exec function other than to reflect the time spent by the
process executing the exec function itself.</p>

<p>The initial value of the CPU-time clock of the initial
thread of the new process image shall be set to zero.</p>

<p>If the calling process is being traced, the new process
image shall continue to be traced into the same trace stream
as the original pro- cess image, but the new process image
shall not inherit the mapping of trace event names to trace
event type identifiers that was defined by calls to the
posix_trace_eventid_open() or the posix_trace_trid_even-
tid_open() functions in the calling process image.</p>

<p>If the calling process is a trace controller process,
any trace streams that were created by the calling process
shall be shut down as described in the
posix_trace_shutdown() function.</p>

<p>The new process shall inherit at least the following
attributes from the calling process image:</p>

<p>* Nice value (see nice())</p>

<p>* semadj values (see semop())</p>

<p>* Process ID</p>

<p>* Parent process ID</p>

<p>* Process group ID</p>

<p>* Session membership</p>

<p>* Real user ID</p>

<p>* Real group ID</p>

<p>* Supplementary group IDs</p>

<p>* Time left until an alarm clock signal (see
alarm())</p>

<p>* Current working directory</p>

<p>* Root directory</p>

<p>* File mode creation mask (see umask())</p>

<p>* File size limit (see ulimit())</p>

<p>* Process signal mask (see sigprocmask())</p>

<p>* Pending signal (see sigpending())</p>

<p>* tms_utime, tms_stime, tms_cutime, and tms_cstime (see
times())</p>

<p>* Resource limits</p>

<p>* Controlling terminal</p>

<p>* Interval timers</p>

<p>All other process attributes defined in this volume of
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 shall be the same in the new and old
process images. The inheritance of process attributes not
defined by this vol- ume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 is
implementation-defined.</p>

<p>A call to any exec function from a process with more
than one thread shall result in all threads being terminated
and the new executable image being loaded and executed. No
destructor functions shall be called.</p>

<p>Upon successful completion, the exec functions shall
mark for update the st_atime field of the file. If an exec
function failed but was able to locate the process image
file, whether the st_atime field is marked for update is
unspecified. Should the exec function succeed, the pro- cess
image file shall be considered to have been opened with
open(). The corresponding close() shall be considered to
occur at a time after this open, but before process
termination or successful completion of a subsequent call to
one of the exec functions, posix_spawn(), or posix_spawnp().
The argv[] and envp[] arrays of pointers and the strings to
which those arrays point shall not be modified by a call to
one of the exec functions, except as a consequence of
replacing the process image.</p>

<p>The saved resource limits in the new process image are
set to be a copy of the process corresponding hard and soft
limits.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE If one of the exec functions returns to the
calling process image, an error has occurred; the return
value shall be -1, and errno shall be set to indicate the
error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The exec functions shall fail if:</p>

<p>E2BIG The number of bytes used by the new process images
argument list and environment list is greater than the
system-imposed limit of {ARG_MAX} bytes.</p>

<p>EACCES Search permission is denied for a directory
listed in the new process image files path prefix, or the
new process image file denies execution permission, or the
new process image file is not a regular file and the
implementation does not support exe- cution of files of its
type.</p>

<p>EINVAL The new process image file has the appropriate
permission and has a recognized executable binary format,
but the system does not support execution of a file with
this format.</p>

<p>ELOOP A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during
resolution of the path or file argument.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG The length of the path or file arguments
exceeds {PATH_MAX} or a pathname component is longer than
{NAME_MAX}.</p>

<p>ENOENT A component of path or file does not name an
existing file or path or file is an empty string.</p>

<p>ENOTDIR A component of the new process image files path
prefix is not a directory.</p>

<p>The exec functions, except for execlp() and execvp(),
shall fail if:</p>

<p>ENOEXEC The new process image file has the appropriate
access permission but has an unrecognized format.</p>

<p>The exec functions may fail if:</p>

<p>ELOOP More than {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic links were
encountered during resolution of the path or file
argument.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG As a result of encountering a symbolic link
in resolution of the path argument, the length of the
substituted pathname string exceeded {PATH_MAX}.</p>

<p>ENOMEM The new process image requires more memory than
is allowed by the hardware or system-imposed memory
management constraints.</p>

<p>ETXTBSY The new process image file is a pure procedure
(shared text) file that is currently open for writing by
some process.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Using execl() The following example executes
the ls command, specifying the pathname of the executable (
/bin/ls) and using arguments supplied directly to the
command to produce single-column output.</p>

<p>#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>int ret; ... ret = execl (&quot;/bin/ls&quot;,
&quot;ls&quot;, &quot;-1&quot;, (char *)0);</p>

<p>Using execle() The following example is similar to Using
execl() . In addition, it specifies the environment for the
new process image using the env argu- ment.</p>

<p>#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>int ret; char *env[] = { &quot;HOME=/usr/home&quot;,
&quot;LOGNAME=home&quot;, (char *)0 }; ... ret = execle
(&quot;/bin/ls&quot;, &quot;ls&quot;, &quot;-l&quot;, (char
*)0, env);</p>

<p>Using execlp() The following example searches for the
location of the ls command among the directories specified
by the PATH environment variable.</p>

<p>#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>int ret; ... ret = execlp (&quot;ls&quot;,
&quot;ls&quot;, &quot;-l&quot;, (char *)0);</p>

<p>Using execv() The following example passes arguments to
the ls command in the cmd array.</p>

<p>#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>int ret; char *cmd[] = { &quot;ls&quot;, &quot;-l&quot;,
(char *)0 }; ... ret = execv (&quot;/bin/ls&quot;, cmd);</p>

<p>Using execve() The following example passes arguments to
the ls command in the cmd array, and specifies the
environment for the new process image using the env
argument.</p>

<p>#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>int ret; char *cmd[] = { &quot;ls&quot;, &quot;-l&quot;,
(char *)0 }; char *env[] = { &quot;HOME=/usr/home&quot;,
&quot;LOGNAME=home&quot;, (char *)0 }; ... ret = execve
(&quot;/bin/ls&quot;, cmd, env);</p>

<p>Using execvp() The following example searches for the
location of the ls command among the directories specified
by the PATH environment variable, and passes arguments to
the ls command in the cmd array.</p>

<p>#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>int ret; char *cmd[] = { &quot;ls&quot;, &quot;-l&quot;,
(char *)0 }; ... ret = execvp (&quot;ls&quot;, cmd);</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE As the state of conversion descriptors
and message catalog descriptors in the new process image is
undefined, conforming applications should not rely on their
use and should close them prior to calling one of the exec
functions.</p>

<p>Applications that require other than the default POSIX
locale should call setlocale() with the appropriate
parameters to establish the locale of the new process.</p>

<p>The environ array should not be accessed directly by the
application.</p>

<p>Applications should not depend on file descriptors 0, 1,
and 2 being closed after an exec. A future version may allow
these file descriptors to be automatically opened for any
process.</p>

<p>RATIONALE Early proposals required that the value of
argc passed to main() be &quot;one or greater&quot;. This
was driven by the same requirement in drafts of the ISO C
standard. In fact, historical implementations have passed a
value of zero when no arguments are supplied to the caller
of the exec functions. This requirement was removed from the
ISO C standard and subsequently removed from this volume of
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 as well. The wording, in particular the
use of the word should, requires a Strictly Conforming POSIX
Application to pass at least one argument to the exec
function, thus guaranteeing that argc be one or greater when
invoked by such an application. In fact, this is good
practice, since many existing applications reference argv[0]
without first checking the value of argc.</p>

<p>The requirement on a Strictly Conforming POSIX
Application also states that the value passed as the first
argument be a filename associated with the process being
started. Although some existing applications pass a pathname
rather than a filename in some circumstances, a file- name
is more generally useful, since the common usage of argv[0]
is in printing diagnostics. In some cases the filename
passed is not the actual filename of the file; for example,
many implementations of the login utility use a convention
of prefixing a hyphen ( - ) to the actual filename, which
indicates to the command interpreter being invoked that it
is a &quot;login shell&quot;.</p>

<p>Historically there have been two ways that
implementations can exec shell scripts.</p>

<p>One common historical implementation is that the
execl(), execv(), exe- cle(), and execve() functions return
an [ENOEXEC] error for any file not recognizable as
executable, including a shell script. When the exe- clp()
and execvp() functions encounter such a file, they assume
the file to be a shell script and invoke a known command
interpreter to interpret such files. This is now required by
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001. These implementations of execvp() and
execlp() only give the [ENOEXEC] error in the rare case of a
problem with the command interpreters exe- cutable file.
Because of these implementations, the [ENOEXEC] error is not
mentioned for execlp() or execvp(), although implementations
can still give it.</p>

<p>Another way that some historical implementations handle
shell scripts is by recognizing the first two bytes of the
file as the character string &quot;#!&quot; and using the
remainder of the first line of the file as the name of the
command interpreter to execute.</p>

<p>One potential source of confusion noted by the standard
developers is over how the contents of a process image file
affect the behavior of the exec family of functions. The
following is a description of the actions taken:</p>

<p>1. If the process image file is a valid executable (in a
format that is executable and valid and having appropriate
permission) for this system, then the system executes the
file.</p>

<p>2. If the process image file has appropriate permission
and is in a format that is executable but not valid for this
system (such as a recognized binary for another
architecture), then this is an error and errno is set to
[EINVAL] (see later RATIONALE on [EINVAL]).</p>

<p>3. If the process image file has appropriate permission
but is not otherwise recognized:</p>

<p>a. If this is a call to execlp() or execvp(), then they
invoke a command interpreter assuming that the process image
file is a shell script.</p>

<p>b. If this is not a call to execlp() or execvp(), then
an error occurs and errno is set to [ENOEXEC].</p>

<p>Applications that do not require to access their
arguments may use the form:</p>

<p>main(void) as specified in the ISO C standard. However,
the implementation will always provide the two arguments
argc and argv, even if they are not used.</p>

<p>Some implementations provide a third argument to main()
called envp. This is defined as a pointer to the
environment. The ISO C standard specifies invoking main()
with two arguments, so implementations must support
applications written this way. Since this volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001 defines the global variable environ, which is
also provided by historical implementations and can be used
anywhere that envp could be used, there is no functional
need for the envp argument. Applications should use the
getenv() function rather than accessing the environment
directly via either envp or environ. Implementations are
required to support the two-argument calling sequence, but
this does not prohibit an implementation from supporting
envp as an optional third argument.</p>

<p>This volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 specifies that
signals set to SIG_IGN remain set to SIG_IGN, and that the
process signal mask be unchanged across an exec. This is
consistent with historical implemen- tations, and it permits
some useful functionality, such as the nohup command.
However, it should be noted that many existing applications
wrongly assume that they start with certain signals set to
the default action and/or unblocked. In particular,
applications written with a simpler signal model that does
not include blocking of signals, such as the one in the ISO
C standard, may not behave properly if invoked with some
signals blocked. Therefore, it is best not to block or
ignore sig- nals across execs without explicit reason to do
so, and especially not to block signals across execs of
arbitrary (not closely co-operating) programs.</p>

<p>The exec functions always save the value of the
effective user ID and effective group ID of the process at
the completion of the exec, whether or not the set-user-ID
or the set-group-ID bit of the process image file is
set.</p>

<p>The statement about argv[] and envp[] being constants is
included to make explicit to future writers of language
bindings that these objects are completely constant. Due to
a limitation of the ISO C standard, it is not possible to
state that idea in standard C. Specifying two levels of
const- qualification for the argv[] and envp[] parameters
for the exec functions may seem to be the natural choice,
given that these functions do not modify either the array of
pointers or the characters to which the function points, but
this would disallow existing correct code. Instead, only the
array of pointers is noted as constant. The ta- ble of
assignment compatibility for dst= src derived from the ISO C
standard summarizes the compatibility:</p>

<p>dst: char *[] const char *[] char *const[] const char
*const[] src: char *[] VALID - VALID - const char *[] -
VALID - VALID char * const [] - - VALID - const char
*const[] - - - VALID</p>

<p>Since all existing code has a source type matching the
first row, the column that gives the most valid combinations
is the third column. The only other possibility is the
fourth column, but using it would require a cast on the argv
or envp arguments. It is unfortunate that the fourth column
cannot be used, because the declaration a non-expert would
natu- rally use would be that in the second row.</p>

<p>The ISO C standard and this volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001 do not con- flict on the use of environ, but
some historical implementations of environ may cause a
conflict. As long as environ is treated in the same way as
an entry point (for example, fork()), it conforms to both
standards. A library can contain fork(), but if there is a
user-pro- vided fork(), that fork() is given precedence and
no problem ensues. The situation is similar for environ: the
definition in this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 is to be
used if there is no user-provided environ to take
precedence. At least three implementations are known to
exist that solve this problem.</p>

<p>E2BIG The limit {ARG_MAX} applies not just to the size
of the argument list, but to the sum of that and the size of
the environment list.</p>

<p>EFAULT Some historical systems return [EFAULT] rather
than [ENOEXEC] when the new process image file is corrupted.
They are non-con- forming.</p>

<p>EINVAL This error condition was added to IEEE Std
1003.1-2001 to allow an implementation to detect executable
files generated for dif- ferent architectures, and indicate
this situation to the appli- cation. Historical
implementations of shells, execvp(), and exe- clp() that
encounter an [ENOEXEC] error will execute a shell on the
assumption that the file is a shell script. This will not
produce the desired effect when the file is a valid
executable for a different architecture. An implementation
may now choose to avoid this problem by returning [EINVAL]
when a valid exe- cutable for a different architecture is
encountered. Some his- torical implementations return
[EINVAL] to indicate that the path argument contains a
character with the high order bit set. The standard
developers chose to deviate from historical prac- tice for
the following reasons:</p>

<p>1. The new utilization of [EINVAL] will provide some
measure of utility to the user community.</p>

<p>2. Historical use of [EINVAL] is not acceptable in an
interna- tionalized operating environment.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG Since the file pathname may be constructed
by taking elements in the PATH variable and putting them
together with the filename, the [ENAMETOOLONG] error
condition could also be reached this way.</p>

<p>ETXTBSY System V returns this error when the executable
file is cur- rently open for writing by some process. This
volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 neither requires nor
prohibits this behav- ior.</p>

<p>Other systems (such as System V) may return [EINTR] from
exec. This is not addressed by this volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001, but implementa- tions may have a window between
the call to exec and the time that a signal could cause one
of the exec calls to return with [EINTR].</p>

<p>An explicit statement regarding the floating-point
environment (as defined in the &lt;fenv.h&gt; header) was
added to make it clear that the floating-point environment
is set to its default when a call to one of the exec
functions succeeds. The requirements for inheritance or set-
ting to the default for other process and thread start-up
functions is covered by more generic statements in their
descriptions and can be summarized as follows:</p>

<p>posix_spawn() Set to default.</p>

<p>fork() Inherit.</p>

<p>pthread_create() Inherit.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
