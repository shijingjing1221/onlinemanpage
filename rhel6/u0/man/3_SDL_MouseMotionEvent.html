<p>SDL_MouseMotionEvent(3) SDL API Reference
SDL_MouseMotionEvent(3)</p>

<p>NAME SDL_MouseMotionEvent - Mouse motion event
structure</p>

<p>STRUCTURE DEFINITION typedef struct{ Uint8 type; Uint8
state; Uint16 x, y; Sint16 xrel, yrel; }
SDL_MouseMotionEvent;</p>

<p>STRUCTURE DATA type SDL_MOUSEMOTION</p>

<p>state The current button state</p>

<p>x, y The X/Y coordinates of the mouse</p>

<p>xrel, yrel Relative motion in the X/Y direction</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION SDL_MouseMotionEvent is a member of the
SDL_Event union and is used when an event of type
SDL_MOUSEMOTION is reported.</p>

<p>Simply put, a SDL_MOUSEMOTION type event occurs when a
user moves the mouse within the application window or when
SDL_WarpMouse is called. Both the absolute (x and y) and
relative (xrel and yrel) coordinates are reported along with
the current button states (state). The button state can be
interpreted using the SDL_BUTTON macro (see SDL_GetMouseS-
tate).</p>

<p>If the cursor is hidden (SDL_ShowCursor(0)) and the
input is grabbed (SDL_WM_GrabInput(SDL_GRAB_ON)), then the
mouse will give relative motion events even when the cursor
reaches the edge fo the screen. This is currently only
implemented on Windows and Linux/Unix-a-likes.</p>
