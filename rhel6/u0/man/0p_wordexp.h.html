<p>NAME wordexp.h - word-expansion types</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;wordexp.h&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The &lt;wordexp.h&gt; header shall define
the structures and symbolic con- stants used by the
wordexp() and wordfree() functions.</p>

<p>The structure type wordexp_t shall contain at least the
following mem- bers:</p>

<p>size_t we_wordc Count of words matched by words. char
**we_wordv Pointer to list of expanded words. size_t we_offs
Slots to reserve at the beginning of we_wordv.</p>

<p>The flags argument to the wordexp() function shall be
the bitwise- inclusive OR of the following flags:</p>

<p>WRDE_APPEND Append words to those previously
generated.</p>

<p>WRDE_DOOFFS Number of null pointers to prepend to
we_wordv.</p>

<p>WRDE_NOCMD Fail if command substitution is
requested.</p>

<p>WRDE_REUSE The pwordexp argument was passed to a
previous successful call to wordexp(), and has not been
passed to wordfree(). The result is the same as if the
application had called wordfree() and then called wordexp()
without WRDE_REUSE.</p>

<p>WRDE_SHOWERR Do not redirect stderr to /dev/null.</p>

<p>WRDE_UNDEF Report error on an attempt to expand an
undefined shell vari- able.</p>

<p>The following constants shall be defined as error return
values:</p>

<p>WRDE_BADCHAR One of the unquoted characters-
&lt;newline&gt;,,, , , , , ,,}- appears in words in an
inappropriate context.</p>

<p>WRDE_BADVAL Reference to undefined shell variable when
WRDE_UNDEF is set in flags.</p>

<p>WRDE_CMDSUB Command substitution requested when
WRDE_NOCMD was set in flags.</p>

<p>WRDE_NOSPACE Attempt to allocate memory failed.</p>

<p>WRDE_NOSYS Reserved.</p>

<p>WRDE_SYNTAX Shell syntax error, such as unbalanced
parentheses or untermi- nated string.</p>

<p>The &lt;wordexp.h&gt; header shall define the following
type:</p>

<p>size_t As described in &lt;stddef.h&gt; .</p>

<p>The following shall be declared as functions and may
also be defined as macros. Function prototypes shall be
provided.</p>

<p>int wordexp(const char *restrict, wordexp_t *restrict,
int); void wordfree(wordexp_t *);</p>

<p>The implementation may define additional macros or
constants using names beginning with WRDE_.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
