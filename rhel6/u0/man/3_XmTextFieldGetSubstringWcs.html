<p>NAME XmTextFieldGetSubstringWcs A TextField function
that retrieves a por- tion of a wide character internal text
buffer</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;Xm/TextF.h&gt; int
XmTextFieldGetSubstringWcs( Widget widget, XmTextPosition
start, int num_chars, int buffer_size, wchar_t *buffer);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION XmTextFieldGetSubstringWcs retrieves a copy
of a portion of the inter- nal text buffer of a TextField
widget that is stored in a wide charac- ter format. The
function copies a specified number of characters from a
given start position in the internal text buffer into a
buffer provided by the application. A NULL terminator is
placed at the end of the copied data.</p>

<p>widget Specifies the TextField widget ID.</p>

<p>start Specifies the beginning character position from
which the data will be retrieved. This is an integer number
of charac- ters from the beginning of the text buffer. The
first charac- ter position is 0 (zero).</p>

<p>num_chars Specifies the number of wchar_t characters to
be copied into the provided buffer.</p>

<p>buffer_size Specifies the size of the supplied buffer as
a number of wchar_t storage locations. The minimum size is
num_chars + 1.</p>

<p>buffer Specifies the wide character buffer into which
the internal text buffer will be copied.</p>

<p>For a complete definition of TextField and its
associated resources, see XmTextField(3).</p>

<p>RETURN XmCOPY_SUCCEEDED The function was successful.</p>

<p>XmCOPY_FAILED The function failed because it was unable
to copy the speci- fied number of characters into the buffer
provided. The buffer size may be insufficient. The contents
of buffer are undefined.</p>

<p>XmCOPY_TRUNCATED The requested number of characters
extended beyond the inter- nal buffer. The function copied
characters to the end of the buffer and terminated the
string with a NULL terminator; fewer than num_chars
characters were copied.</p>
