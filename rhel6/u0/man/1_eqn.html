<p>NAME eqn - format equations for troff</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS eqn [ -rvCNR ] [ -dxy ] [ -Tname ] [ -Mdir ] [
-fF ] [ -sn ] [ -pn ] [ -mn ] [ files... ]</p>

<p>It is possible to have whitespace between a command line
option and its parameter.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page describes the GNU version
of eqn, which is part of the groff document formatting
system. eqn compiles descriptions of equa- tions embedded
within troff input files into commands that are under- stood
by troff. Normally, it should be invoked using the -e option
of groff. The syntax is quite compatible with Unix eqn. The
output of GNU eqn cannot be processed with Unix troff; it
must be processed with GNU troff. If no files are given on
the command line, the standard input will be read. A
filename of - will cause the standard input to be read.</p>

<p>eqn searches for the file eqnrc in the directories given
with the -M option first, then in
/usr/lib64/groff/site-tmac, /usr/share/groff/site-tmac, and
finally in the standard macro directory
/usr/share/groff/1.18.1.4/tmac. If it exists, eqn will
process it before the other input files. The -R option
prevents this.</p>

<p>GNU eqn does not provide the functionality of neqn: it
does not support low-resolution, typewriter-like devices
(although it may work ade- quately for very simple
input).</p>

<p>OPTIONS -dxy Specify delimiters x and y for the left and
right end, respec- tively, of in-line equations. Any delim
statements in the source file overrides this.</p>

<p>-C Recognize .EQ and .EN even when followed by a
character other than space or newline.</p>

<p>-N Dont allow newlines within delimiters. This option
allows eqn to recover better from missing closing
delimiters.</p>

<p>-v Print the version number.</p>

<p>-r Only one size reduction.</p>

<p>-mn The minimum point-size is n. eqn will not reduce the
size of subscripts or superscripts to a smaller size than
n.</p>

<p>-Tname The output is for device name. The only effect of
this is to define a macro name with a value of 1. Typically
eqnrc will use this to provide definitions appropriate for
the output device. The default output device is ps.</p>

<p>-Mdir Search dir for eqnrc before the default
directories.</p>

<p>-R Dont load eqnrc.</p>

<p>-fF This is equivalent to a gfont F command.</p>

<p>-sn This is equivalent to a gsize n command. This option
is depre- cated. eqn will normally set equations at whatever
the current point size is when the equation is
encountered.</p>

<p>-pn This says that subscripts and superscripts should be
n points smaller than the surrounding text. This option is
deprecated. Normally eqn makes sets subscripts and
superscripts at 70% of the size of the surrounding text.</p>

<p>USAGE Only the differences between GNU eqn and Unix eqn
are described here.</p>

<p>Most of the new features of GNU eqn are based on TeX.
There are some references to the differences between TeX and
GNU eqn below; these may safely be ignored if you do not
know TeX.</p>

<p>Automatic spacing eqn gives each component of an
equation a type, and adjusts the spacing between components
using that type. Possible types are:</p>

<p>ordinary an ordinary character such as 1 or x;</p>

<p>operator a large operator such as ;</p>

<p>binary a binary operator such as +;</p>

<p>relation a relation such as =;</p>

<p>opening a opening bracket such as (;</p>

<p>closing a closing bracket such as );</p>

<p>punctuation a punctuation character such as ,;</p>

<p>inner a subformula contained within brackets;</p>

<p>suppress spacing that suppresses automatic spacing
adjustment.</p>

<p>Components of an equation get a type in one of two
ways.</p>

<p>type t e This yields an equation component that contains
e but that has type t, where t is one of the types mentioned
above. For exam- ple, times is defined as</p>

<p>type &quot;binary&quot;(mu</p>

<p>The name of the type doesnt have to be quoted, but
quoting pro- tects from macro expansion.</p>

<p>chartype t text Unquoted groups of characters are split
up into individual char- acters, and the type of each
character is looked up; this changes the type that is stored
for each character; it says that the characters in text from
now on have type t. For example,</p>

<p>chartype &quot;punctuation&quot; .,;:</p>

<p>would make the characters .,;: have type punctuation
whenever they subsequently appeared in an equation. The type
t can also be letter or digit; in these cases chartype
changes the font type of the characters. See the Fonts
subsection.</p>

<p>New primitives e1 smallover e2 This is similar to over;
smallover reduces the size of e1 and e2; it also puts less
vertical space between e1 or e2 and the fraction bar. The
over primitive corresponds to the TeX vver primitive in
display styles; smallover corresponds tovver in non-display
styles.</p>

<p>vcenter e This vertically centers e about the math axis.
The math axis is the vertical position about which
characters such as + and - are centered; also it is the
vertical position used for the bar of fractions. For
example, sum is defined as</p>

<p>{ type &quot;operator&quot; vcenter size +5(*S }</p>

<p>e1 accent e2 This sets e2 as an accent over e1. e2 is
assumed to be at the correct height for a lowercase letter;
e2 will be moved down according if e1 is taller or shorter
than a lowercase letter. For example, hat is defined as</p>

<p>accent { &quot;^&quot; }</p>

<p>dotdot, dot, tilde, vec and dyad are also defined using
the accent primitive.</p>

<p>e1 uaccent e2 This sets e2 as an accent under e1. e2 is
assumed to be at the correct height for a character without
a descender; e2 will be moved down if e1 has a descender.
utilde is pre-defined using uaccent as a tilde accent below
the baseline.</p>

<p>split &quot;text&quot; This has the same effect as
simply</p>

<p>text</p>

<p>but text is not subject to macro expansion because it is
quoted; text will be split up and the spacing between
individual charac- ters will be adjusted.</p>

<p>nosplit text This has the same effect as</p>

<p>&quot;text&quot;</p>

<p>but because text is not quoted it will be subject to
macro expansion; text will not be split up and the spacing
between individual characters will not be adjusted.</p>

<p>e opprime This is a variant of prime that acts as an
operator on e. It produces a different result from prime in
a case such as A opprime sub 1: with opprime the 1 will be
tucked under the prime as a subscript to the A (as is
conventional in mathemati- cal typesetting), whereas with
prime the 1 will be a subscript to the prime character. The
precedence of opprime is the same as that of bar and under,
which is higher than that of every- thing except accent and
uaccent. In unquoted text a that is not the first character
will be treated like opprime.</p>

<p>special text e This constructs a new object from e using
a troff(1) macro named text. When the macro is called, the
string 0s will contain the output for e, and the number
registers 0w, 0h, 0d, 0skern and 0skew will contain the
width, height, depth, subscript kern, and skew of e. (The
subscript kern of an object says how much a subscript on
that object should be tucked in; the skew of an object says
how far to the right of the center of the object an accent
over the object should be placed.) The macro must modify 0s
so that it will output the desired result with its origin at
the current point, and increase the current horizontal
position by the width of the object. The number registers
must also be modified so that they correspond to the
result.</p>

<p>For example, suppose you wanted a construct that cancels
an expression by drawing a diagonal line through it.</p>

<p>.EQ define cancelspecial Ca .EN .de Ca .ds
0s*(0n(0dln(0wu n(0hun(0dn(0hu ..</p>

<p>Then you could cancel an expression e with cancel { e
}</p>

<p>Here s a more complicated construct that draws a box
round an expression:</p>

<p>.EQ define boxspecial Bx .EN .de Bx .ds 0s1*(0s
n(0du+1ln(0wu+2n 0l 0 n(0hun(0du-2n l n(0wu-2n l
0n(0hun(0du+2n(0wu+2n .nr 0w +2n .nr 0d +1n .nr 0h +1n
..</p>

<p>Customization The appearance of equations is controlled
by a large number of parame- ters. These can be set using
the set command.</p>

<p>set p n This sets parameter p to value n ; n is an
integer. For exam- ple,</p>

<p>set x_height 45</p>

<p>says that eqn should assume an x height of 0.45 ems.</p>

<p>Possible parameters are as follows. Values are in units
of hun- dredths of an em unless otherwise stated. These
descriptions are intended to be expository rather than
definitive.</p>

<p>minimum_size eqn will not set anything at a smaller
point-size than this. The value is in points.</p>

<p>fat_offset The fat primitive emboldens an equation by
overprinting two copies of the equa- tion horizontally
offset by this amount.</p>

<p>over_hang A fraction bar will be longer by twice this
amount than the maximum of the widths of the numerator and
denominator; in other words, it will overhang the numerator
and denominator by at least this amount.</p>

<p>accent_width When bar or under is applied to a single
character, the line will be this long. Normally, bar or
under produces a line whose length is the width of the
object to which it applies; in the case of a single
character, this tends to produce a line that looks too
long.</p>

<p>delimiter_factor Extensible delimiters produced with the
left and right primitives will have a combined height and
depth of at least this many thousandths of twice the maxi-
mum amount by which the sub-equation that the delimiters
enclose extends away from the axis.</p>

<p>delimiter_shortfall Extensible delimiters produced with
the left and right primitives will have a combined height
and depth not less than the difference of twice the maximum
amount by which the sub-equation that the delimiters enclose
extends away from the axis and this amount.</p>

<p>null_delimiter_space This much horizontal space is
inserted on each side of a fraction.</p>

<p>script_space The width of subscripts and superscripts is
increased by this amount.</p>

<p>thin_space This amount of space is automatically
inserted after punctuation characters.</p>

<p>medium_space This amount of space is automatically
inserted on either side of binary opera- tors.</p>

<p>thick_space This amount of space is automatically
inserted on either side of relations.</p>

<p>x_height The height of lowercase letters without
ascenders such as x.</p>

<p>axis_height The height above the baseline of the center
of characters such as + and . It is important that this
value is cor- rect for the font you are using.</p>

<p>default_rule_thickness This should set to the thickness
of the (ru character, or the thickness of hor- izontal lines
produced with the escape sequence.</p>

<p>num1 The over command will shift up the numerator by at
least this amount.</p>

<p>num2 The smallover command will shift up the numerator
by at least this amount.</p>

<p>denom1 The over command will shift down the denominator
by at least this amount.</p>

<p>denom2 The smallover command will shift down the
denominator by at least this amount.</p>

<p>sup1 Normally superscripts will be shifted up by at
least this amount.</p>

<p>sup2 Superscripts within superscripts or upper limits or
numerators of smallover fractions will be shifted up by at
least this amount. This is usually less than sup1.</p>

<p>sup3 Superscripts within denominators or square roots or
subscripts or lower lim- its will be shifted up by at least
this amount. This is usually less than sup2.</p>

<p>sub1 Subscripts will normally be shifted down by at
least this amount.</p>

<p>sub2 When there is both a subscript and a superscript,
the subscript will be shifted down by at least this
amount.</p>

<p>sup_drop The baseline of a superscript will be no more
than this much amount below the top of the object on which
the superscript is set.</p>

<p>sub_drop The baseline of a subscript will be at least
this much below the bottom of the object on which the
subscript is set.</p>

<p>big_op_spacing1 The baseline of an upper limit will be
at least this much above the top of the object on which the
limit is set.</p>

<p>big_op_spacing2 The baseline of a lower limit will be at
least this much below the bottom of the object on which the
limit is set.</p>

<p>big_op_spacing3 The bottom of an upper limit will be at
least this much above the top of the object on which the
limit is set.</p>

<p>big_op_spacing4 The top of a lower limit will be at
least this much below the bottom of the object on which the
limit is set.</p>

<p>big_op_spacing5 This much vertical space will be added
above and below limits.</p>

<p>baseline_sep The baselines of the rows in a pile or
matrix will normally be this far apart. In most cases this
should be equal to the sum of num1 and denom1.</p>

<p>shift_down The midpoint between the top baseline and the
bottom baseline in a matrix or pile will be shifted down by
this much from the axis. In most cases this should be equal
to axis_height.</p>

<p>column_sep This much space will be added between columns
in a matrix.</p>

<p>matrix_side_sep This much space will be added at each
side of a matrix.</p>

<p>draw_lines If this is non-zero, lines will be drawn
using the than with the escape sequence and the (ru
character.</p>

<p>body_height The amount by which the height of the
equation exceeds this will be added as extra space before
the line containing the equation (using .) The default value
is 85.</p>

<p>body_depth The amount by which the depth of the equation
exceeds this will be added as extra space after the line
containing the equation (using .) The default value is
35.</p>

<p>nroff If this is non-zero, then ndefine will behave like
define and tdefine will be ignored, otherwise tdefine will
behave like define and ndefine will be ignored. The default
value is 0 (This is typi- cally changed to 1 by the eqnrc
file for the ascii, latin1, utf8, and cp1047 devices.)</p>

<p>A more precise description of the role of many of these
parame- ters can be found in Appendix H of The TeXbook.</p>

<p>Macros Macros can take arguments. In a macro body, $n
where n is between 1 and 9, will be replaced by the n-th
argument if the macro is called with arguments; if there are
fewer than n arguments, it will be replaced by nothing. A
word containing a left parenthesis where the part of the
word before the left parenthesis has been defined using the
define command will be recognized as a macro call with
arguments; char- acters following the left parenthesis up to
a matching right parenthe- sis will be treated as
comma-separated arguments; commas inside nested parentheses
do not terminate an argument.</p>

<p>sdefine name X anything X This is like the define
command, but name will not be recognized if called with
arguments.</p>

<p>include &quot;file&quot; Include the contents of file.
Lines of file beginning with .EQ or .EN will be ignored.</p>

<p>ifdef name X anything X If name has been defined by
define (or has been automatically defined because name is
the output device) process anything; otherwise ignore
anything. X can be any character not appearing in
anything.</p>

<p>Fonts eqn normally uses at least two fonts to set an
equation: an italic font for letters, and a roman font for
everything else. The existing gfont command changes the font
that is used as the italic font. By default this is I. The
font that is used as the roman font can be changed using the
new grfont command.</p>

<p>grfont f Set the roman font to f.</p>

<p>The italic primitive uses the current italic font set by
gfont; the roman primitive uses the current roman font set
by grfont. There is also a new gbfont command, which changes
the font used by the bold primitive. If you only use the
roman, italic and bold primitives to changes fonts within an
equation, you can change all the fonts used by your
equations just by using gfont, grfont and gbfont
commands.</p>

<p>You can control which characters are treated as letters
(and therefore set in italics) by using the chartype command
described above. A type of letter will cause a character to
be set in italic type. A type of digit will cause a
character to be set in roman type.</p>
