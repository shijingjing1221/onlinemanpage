<p>NAME jsadebugd - Serviceability Agent Debug Daemon</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS jsadebugd pid [ server-id ] jsadebugd
executable core [ server-id ]</p>

<p>PARAMETERS pid process id of the process to which the
debug server should attach. The process must be a Java
process. To get a list of Java processes running on a
machine, jps may be used. At most one instance of the debug
server may be attached to a single process.</p>

<p>executable</p>

<p>Java executable from which the core dump was
produced</p>

<p>core Core file to which the debug server should
attach.</p>

<p>server-id Optional unique id, needed if multiple debug
servers are started on the same machine. This ID must be
used by remote clients to identify the particular debug
server to attach. Within a single machine, this ID must be
unique.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION jsadebugd attaches to a Java process or core
file and acts as a debug server. Remote clients such as
jstack, jmap, and jinfo can attach to the server using Java
Remote Method Invocation (RMI). Before starting jsadebugd,
rmiregistry must be started with:</p>

<p>rmiregistry
-J-Xbootclasspath/p:$JAVA_HOME/lib/sajdi.jar</p>

<p>where $JAVA_HOME is the JDK installation directory. If
rmiregistry was not started, jsadebugd will start an
rmiregistry in a standard (1099) port internally. Debug
server may be stopped by sending SIGINT (press- ing Ctrl-C)
to it.</p>

<p>NOTE - This utility is unsupported and may or may not be
available in future versions of the JDK. jsadebugd is not
currently available on Windows platforms.</p>
