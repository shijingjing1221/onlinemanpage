<p>SDL_SemWaitTimeout(3) SDL API Reference
SDL_SemWaitTimeout(3)</p>

<p>NAME SDL_SemWaitTimeout - Lock a semaphore, but only
wait up to a specified maximum time.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &quot;SDL.h&quot; #include
&quot;SDL_thread.h&quot;</p>

<p>int SDL_SemWaitTimeout(SDL_sem *sem, Uint32
timeout);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION SDL_SemWaitTimeout() is a varient of
SDL_SemWait with a maximum timeout value. If the value of
the semaphore pointed to by sem is positive (greater than
zero) it will atomically decrement the semaphore value and
return 0, otherwise it will wait up to timeout milliseconds
trying to lock the semaphore. This function is to be avoided
if possible since on some platforms it is implemented by
polling the semaphore every mil- lisecond in a busy
loop.</p>

<p>After SDL_SemWaitTimeout() is successful, the semaphore
can be released and its count atomically incremented by a
successful call to SDL_Sem- Post.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Returns 0 if the semaphore was successfully
locked or either SDL_MUTEX_TIMEOUT or -1 if the timeout
period was exceeded or there was an error, respectivly.</p>

<p>If the semaphore was not successfully locked, the
semaphore will be unchanged.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES res = SDL_SemWaitTimeout(my_sem,
WAIT_TIMEOUT_MILLISEC);</p>

<p>if (res == SDL_MUTEX_TIMEOUT) { return TRY_AGAIN; } if
(res == -1) { return WAIT_ERROR; }</p>
