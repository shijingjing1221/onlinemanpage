<p>SETTERM(1) Linux Programmer s Manual SETTERM(1)</p>

<p>NAME setterm - set terminal attributes</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS setterm [options]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION setterm writes to standard output a
character string that will invoke the specified terminal
capabilities. Where possible terminfo is con- sulted to find
the string to use. Some options however (marked &quot;vir-
tual consoles only&quot; below) do not correspond to a
terminfo(5) capabil- ity. In this case, if the terminal type
is &quot;con&quot; or &quot;linux&quot; the string that
invokes the specified capabilities on the PC Minix virtual
console driver is output. Options that are not implemented
by the terminal are ignored.</p>

<p>OPTIONS For boolean options (on or off), the default is
on.</p>

<p>For conciseness, an 8-color below is black, red, green,
yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, or white.</p>

<p>A 16-color is an 8-color, grey, or bright followed by
red, green, yel- low, blue, magenta, cyan, or white.</p>

<p>The various color options may be set independently, at
least at virtual consoles, though the results of setting
multiple modes (for example, -underline and -half-bright)
are hardware-dependent.</p>

<p>-term terminal_name Overrides the TERM environment
variable.</p>

<p>-reset Displays the terminal reset string, which
typically resets the terminal to its power on state.</p>

<p>-initialize Displays the terminal initialization string,
which typically sets the terminal s rendering options, and
other attributes to the default values.</p>

<p>-cursor [on|off] Turns the terminals cursor on or
off.</p>

<p>-repeat [on|off] (virtual consoles only) Turns keyboard
repeat on or off.</p>

<p>-appcursorkeys [on|off] (virtual consoles only) Sets
Cursor Key Application Mode on or off. When on, ESC O A, ESC
O B, etc. will be sent for the cursor keys instead of ESC [
A, ESC [ B, etc. See the &quot;vi and Cursor-Keys&quot;
section of the Text-Terminal-HOWTO for how this can cause
problems for vi users.</p>

<p>-linewrap [on|off] (virtual consoles only) Turns
automatic line-wrapping on or off.</p>

<p>-default Sets the terminals rendering options to the
default values.</p>

<p>-foreground 8-color|default (virtual consoles only) Sets
the foreground text color.</p>

<p>-background 8-color|default (virtual consoles only) Sets
the background text color.</p>

<p>-ulcolor 16-color (virtual consoles only) Sets the color
for underlined characters.</p>

<p>-hbcolor 16-color (virtual consoles only) Sets the color
for half-bright characters.</p>

<p>-inversescreen [on|off] (virtual consoles only) Inverts
the screen colors. Foreground and background are swapped, as
are underline and half-brightness.</p>

<p>-bold [on|off] Turns bold (extra bright) mode on or off.
Except at a virtual console, -bold off turns off all
attributes (bold, half-bright- ness, blink, reverse).</p>

<p>-half-bright [on|off] Turns dim (half-brightness) mode
on or off (see -hbcolor). Except at a virtual console,
-half-bright off turns off all attributes (bold,
half-brightness, blink, reverse).</p>

<p>-blink [on|off] Turns blink mode on or off. Except at a
virtual console, -blink off turns off all attributes (bold,
half-brightness, blink, reverse).</p>

<p>-reverse [on|off] Turns reverse video mode on or off.
Except at a virtual con- sole, -reverse off turns off all
attributes (bold, half-bright- ness, blink, reverse).</p>

<p>-underline [on|off] Turns underline mode on or off (see
-ulcolor).</p>

<p>-store (virtual consoles only) Stores the terminal s
current rendering options (foreground and background colors)
as the values to be used at reset-to-default.</p>

<p>-clear [all] Clears the screen and &quot;homes&quot; the
cursor, as clear(1).</p>

<p>-clear rest Clears from the current cursor position to
the end of the screen.</p>

<p>-tabs [tab1 tab2 tab3 ...] (virtual consoles only) Sets
tab stops at the given horizontal cursor positions, in the
range 1-160. Without arguments, shows the current tab stop
set- tings.</p>

<p>-clrtabs [tab1 tab2 tab3 ...] (virtual consoles only)
Clears tab stops from the given horizontal cursor positions,
in the range 1-160. Without arguments, clears all tab
stops.</p>

<p>-regtabs [1-160] (virtual consoles only) Clears all tab
stops, then sets a regular tab stop pattern, with one tab
every specified number of positions. Without an argu- ment,
defaults to 8.</p>

<p>-blank [0-60|force|poke] (virtual consoles only) Sets
the interval of inactivity, in minutes, after which the
screen will be automatically blanked (using APM if
available). Without an argument, gets the blank status
(returns which vt was blanked or zero for unblanked vt).</p>

<p>The force option keeps screen blank even if a key is
pressed.</p>

<p>The poke option unblank the screen.</p>

<p>-dump [1-NR_CONS] Writes a snapshot of the given virtual
console (with attributes) to the file specified in the -file
option, overwriting its con- tents; the default is
screen.dump. Without an argument, dumps the current virtual
console. Overrides -append.</p>

<p>-append [1-NR_CONS] Like -dump, but appends to the
snapshot file instead of over- writing it. Only works if no
-dump options are given.</p>

<p>-file dumpfilename Sets the snapshot file name for any
-dump or -append options on the same command line. If this
option is not present, the default is screen.dump in the
current directory.</p>

<p>-msg [on|off] (virtual consoles only) Enables or
disables the sending of kernel printk() messages to the
console.</p>

<p>-msglevel 1-8 (virtual consoles only) Sets the console
logging level for kernel printk() messages. All messages
strictly more important than this will be printed, so a
logging level of 0 has the same effect as -msg on and a
logging level of 8 will print all kernel messages. klogd(8)
may be a more convenient interface to the logging of kernel
mes- sages.</p>

<p>-powersave on|vsync Puts the monitor into VESA vsync
suspend mode.</p>

<p>-powersave hsync Puts the monitor into VESA hsync
suspend mode.</p>

<p>-powersave powerdown Puts the monitor into VESA
powerdown mode.</p>

<p>-powersave [off] Turns off monitor VESA powersaving
features.</p>

<p>-powerdown [0-60] Sets the VESA powerdown interval in
minutes. Without an argu- ment, defaults to 0 (disable
powerdown). If the console is blanked or the monitor is in
suspend mode, then the monitor will go into vsync suspend
mode or powerdown mode respectively after this period of
time has elapsed.</p>

<p>-blength [0-2000] Sets the bell duration in
milliseconds. Without an argument, defaults to 0.</p>

<p>-bfreq [freqnumber] Sets the bell frequency in Hz.
Without an argument, defaults to 0.</p>

<p>BUGS Differences between the Minix and Linux versions
are not documented.</p>

<p>AVAILABILITY The setterm command is part of the
util-linux-ng package and is avail- able from
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux-ng/.</p>
