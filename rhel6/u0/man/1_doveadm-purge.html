<p>DOVEADM-PURGE(1) Dovecot DOVEADM-PURGE(1)</p>

<p>NAME doveadm-purge - Remove messages with refcount=0
from mdbox files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS doveadm [-Dv] purge doveadm [-Dv] purge -A
doveadm [-Dv] purge -u user</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The doveadm purge command is used to remove
all messages with ref- count=0 from a user&rsquo;s mail
storage. The refcount of a message is decreased to 0 when
the user (or some administration utility) has expunged all
instances of a message from all mailboxes.</p>

<p>In the first form, doveadm(1) will perform the purge
action for the currently logged in user.</p>

<p>In the second form, the command will be executed for all
users</p>

<p>In the last form, only messages of the given user(s)
will be purged.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Global doveadm(1) options:</p>

<p>-D Enables verbosity and debug messages.</p>

<p>-v Enables verbosity, including progress counter.</p>

<p>Command specific options:</p>

<p>-A If the -A option is present, the command will be
performed for all users. Using this option in combination
with system users from userdb { driver = passwd } is not
recommended, because it contains also users with a lower UID
than the one configured with the first_valid_uid
setting.</p>

<p>When the sql userdb module is used make sure that the
iter- ate_query setting in the
/etc/dovecot/dovecot-sql.conf.ext matches your database
layout. Otherwise doveadm(1) will be unable to iterate over
all users.</p>

<p>-u user/mask Run the command only for the given user.
It&rsquo;s also possible to use &rsquo;*&rsquo; and
&rsquo;?&rsquo; wildcards (e.g. -u *@example.org). When
neither the -A option nor -u user was specified, the com-
mand will be executed with the environment of the currently
logged in user.</p>
