<p>Tcl_StaticPackage(3) Tcl Library Procedures
Tcl_StaticPackage(3)</p>


<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME Tcl_StaticPackage - make a statically linked
package available via the load command</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tcl.h&gt;</p>

<p>Tcl_StaticPackage(interp, pkgName, initProc,
safeInitProc)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS Tcl_Interp *interp (in) If not NULL, points to
an interpreter into which the package has already been
loaded (i.e., the caller has already invoked the appropriate
initializa- tion procedure). NULL means the package has not
yet been incorpo- rated into any inter- preter.</p>

<p>const char *pkgName (in) Name of the package; should be
properly cap- italized (first letter upper-case, all others
lower-case).</p>

<p>Tcl_PackageInitProc *initProc (in) Procedure to invoke
to incorporate this pack- age into a trusted
interpreter.</p>

<p>Tcl_PackageInitProc *safeInitProc (in) Procedure to call
to incorporate this pack- age into a safe inter- preter (one
that will execute untrusted scripts). NULL means the package
cannot be used in safe inter- preters.
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This procedure may be invoked to announce
that a package has been linked statically with a Tcl
application and, optionally, that it has already been loaded
into an interpreter. Once Tcl_StaticPackage has been invoked
for a package, it may be loaded into interpreters using the
load command. Tcl_StaticPackage is normally invoked only by
the Tcl_AppInit procedure for the application, not by
packages for them- selves (Tcl_StaticPackage should only be
invoked for statically loaded packages, and code in the
package itself should not need to know whether the package
is dynamically or statically loaded).</p>

<p>When the load command is used later to load the package
into an inter- preter, one of initProc and safeInitProc will
be invoked, depending on whether the target interpreter is
safe or not. initProc and safeInitProc must both match the
following prototype: typedef int
Tcl_PackageInitProc(Tcl_Interp *interp); The interp argument
identifies the interpreter in which the package is to be
loaded. The initialization procedure must return TCL_OK or
TCL_ERROR to indicate whether or not it completed
successfully; in the event of an error it should set the
interpreters result to point to an error message. The result
or error from the initialization procedure will be returned
as the result of the load command that caused the ini-
tialization procedure to be invoked.</p>
