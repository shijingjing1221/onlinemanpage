<p>NAME pci_get_bus_and_slot - locate PCI device from a
given PCI bus &amp; slot</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS struct pci_dev * pci_get_bus_and_slot(unsigned
int bus, unsigned int devfn);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS bus number of PCI bus on which desired PCI
device resides</p>

<p>devfn encodes number of PCI slot in which the desired
PCI device resides and the logical device number within that
slot in case of multi-function devices.</p>

<p>NOTE the bus/slot search is limited to PCI domain
(segment) 0.</p>

<p>Given a PCI bus and slot/function number, the desired
PCI device is located in system global list of PCI devices.
If the device is found, a pointer to its data structure is
returned. If no device is found, NULL is returned. The
returned device has its reference count bumped by one.</p>
