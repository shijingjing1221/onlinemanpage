<p>isdnrep(1) Linux System Commands isdnrep(1)</p>

<p>NAME isdnrep - report isdn activity</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Isdnrep reads the isdnlog log files,
generates reports, does statis- tics, and other things. It
can also generate HTML output for use with a web server.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -V show version information and exit.</p>

<p>-a all Show all connections registered. If this option
is not given, show only the connections made today.</p>

<p>-S Summary Show a summary (no individual calls) for
selected date range. If this option is given twice, the
summaries per day are hidden too. Dont use with -h</p>

<p>-h no header There will be no header for each day, nor
will the summary at the end of each day and at the end of
the report be generated. This is useful if the output is to
be processed by another pro- gram.</p>

<p>This option doesnt work if the -wX is also given.</p>

<p>-n numbers Display numbers instead of the aliases for
those numbers.</p>

<p>-fFILE The file from which to generate the report. This
is usually /var/log/isdn.log, or whatever is configured in
/etc/isdn/isdn.conf as LOGFILE = . The -f option will
override the setting in /etc/isdn/isdn.conf.</p>

<p>-t time span time=&quot;time span&quot; With this option
a specific time span covered by the log file can be
displayed, e.g. all calls in November 1995, or on January
3rd 1996 between 03:00 and 09:45.</p>

<p>The format in which times are given is described below.
The time span has the following syntax:</p>

<p>time-time display from begin time up to end time time-
display from given time up to &quot;now&quot; -time display
from beginning of log file up to given time time display the
given month, day, hour, ...</p>

<p>-d -time delete=&quot;time&quot; Delete entries from the
log file up to (but not including) the specified time. The
format is the same as for the -t option. The minus before
the time must be given! It is not possible to define begin
and end times; entries are always deleted from the beginning
up to the time given.</p>

<p>Warning! Entries are really deleted from the file.
Careless use can result in all entries being deleted, e.g.
with &quot;isdnrep -d -&quot;.</p>

<p>-E print Errors Display all connections and connection
attempts. Without this option, only successful connections
are displayed.</p>

<p>-v verbose Display warnings on startup.</p>

<p>-c ignore default options Do not append the
&quot;REPOPTIONS&quot; setting from /etc/isdn/isdn.conf to
the commandline.</p>

<p>-p [n][mnumbe[,[mnumbe...] phonenumber Display only
selected phone numbers.</p>

<p>&quot;number&quot; is specified in the same format as in
configuration files (see isdn.conf(5)). E.g. wildcards can
be used.</p>

<p>If the flag m is given, the corresponding MSN is meant.
E.g.: &quot;m2&quot; means MSN#2. If &quot;m0&quot; is
given, all numbers are to be dis- played.</p>

<p>If the flag n is given, the given number is not to be
dis- played.</p>

<p>-U [_][.numberdefault source number Use number as source
number for outgoing calls with an unknown source number
(&quot;?&quot;). . is replaced by country and area code from
isdn.conf.</p>

<p>With _ the default source number is used internally
(e.g. for fetching the right zone names from the ratefile)
but it is not displayed.</p>

<p>-i incoming Only incoming connections are displayed.</p>

<p>-o outgoing Only outgoing connections are displayed.</p>

<p>-xX include/exclude calls Select calls by day and/or
hour. The following selections are possible and can
specified in any combination and quantity using : as
separator: ddaylist only days matching daylist Ddaylist all
days not matching daylist htimelist only hours matching
timelist Htimelist all hours not matching timelist</p>

<p>daylist and timelist have the same syntax as described
in rate- files(5). If a day or an hour is included and
excluded it will be excluded.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>-xd2-4:DH:h9-17:H12-15</p>

<p>This will display all calls on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, or
Thursdays that are no holidays with a start time between
09:00 and 12:00 or 15:00 and 17:00.</p>

<p>-u unknown caller At the end of the report, all numbers
not aliased in cal- lerid.conf or ~/.isdn are displayed.
This option is not avail- able when HTML output is
requested.</p>

<p>-LX summary lists Select the summaries in the footer by
any combination of the following letters: i,I foreign
numbers of incoming calls o,O foreign numbers of outgoing
calls c,C foreign numbers of all calls z,Z zones of outgoing
calls p,P providers of outgoing calls m,M MSNs (own
subscriber numbers) of outgoing calls</p>

<p>Upper case letters deselect, lower case letters select a
summary. With at least one lower case letter, only the
selected summaries are shown, as long as they are not also
deselected. -LiI for example will show no summary at all.
Per default all summaries are displayed.</p>

<p>-rPROV recompute Recompute the connection fees with the
current ratefile instead of showing the amounts stored in
the logfile as usual. The provider PROV for recomputation is
selected in one of the fol- lowing ways:</p>

<p>- Use the logged provider. pNUM Use provider with Pnum
NUM (according to P: tag in ratefile). The provider variant
is taken from rate.conf where the provider must be enabled.
pNUM_VAR Use provider with Pnum NUM and variant VAR
(according to P:NUM,VAR in ratefile). No requirements for
rate.conf. vVBN vVBN_VAR Similar to pNUM[_VAR] but the
provider is selected via VBN (B: tag in ratefile) instead of
Pnum. b Use the cheapest of all booked providers. The
provider selection is done per call. Booked providers are
those, which are enabled in rate.conf B Like b but allow all
providers, not only the booked.</p>

<p>-m[*|/]number modify call costs Multiply (*) or divide
(/) the stored or recalculated call costs by number before
displaying them. If neither * nor / is given, multiply.</p>

<p>-wX WWW isdnrep can give its output in HTML format; this
is switched on with this option. Two modes are possible:</p>

<p>0 The HTML header is suppressed. Useful if the output is
to be included into an existing page. 1 A complete HTML page
is generated.</p>

<p>-sX format string The output generated by isdnrep can be
modified by specifying the format of the line generated for
each connection. The syntax is similar to that used by
printf. The following parameters are possible (the x where
given means that a width for the field, also known as the
precision, must be given):</p>

<p>%X time without date, e.g. 23:54:06 %x the date, e.g.
25/07/97 %y date without year, e.g. Sun May 04 %Y year, in
four digits, e.g. 1997 %D duration of connection, e.g.
00:03:34 %xH the local MSN; if an alias can be found, that
will be dis- played instead %xh the local MSN, only as a
number; no aliases will be substi- tuted %xF the remote
number; if an alias can be found, that will be displayed
instead %xf the remote number, only as a number; no aliases
will be sub- stituted %xL the town corresponding to the
local MSN if known; an empty string otherwise %xl the town
corresponding to the remote number if known; an empty string
otherwise %T an arrow indicating the direction of the
connection (&quot;-&gt;&quot; outgoing or &quot;&lt;-&quot;
incoming); the local MSN should be dis- played on the left
side of this. %t an arrow indicating the direction of the
connection, reversed (&quot;&lt;-&quot; outgoing or
&quot;-&gt;&quot; incoming); the local MSN should be
displayed on the right side of this. %xu the charge units,
if known, e.g. 6 EH %U the cost, if known, e.g. 2,28 DM %xj
the name of the used provider %v the VBN (carrier selection
prefix) of the provider, e.g. 01012 %V the VBN and variant
of the provider, e.g. 01012_3 %I amount of INPUT data %O
amount of OUTPUT data %P INPUT throughput (bps) %p OUTPUT
throughput (bps) %S Service Indicator %G displays a HTTP
link to the corresponding fax, when a fax was received by
mgetty. This fax can be displayed by using the link in a
HTTP browser.</p>

<p>This option is only valid when used with -wx, see below
for more information. %C displays a HTTP link to the
corresponding voice file, when a call was recorded by vbox.
This option is only valid when used with -wx, see below for
more information.</p>

<p>The default format string for (non-HTML output) is
&quot; %X %D %15.15H %T %-15.15F %7u %U %I %O&quot;</p>

<p>With the following string all the important data is
displayed while keeping the total length to 80:</p>

<p>&quot;%X%D %10.10H%T%-14.14F%U%I %O&quot;</p>

<p>The above string is put into isdn.conf at installation
as REPFMTSHORT and can be used with -Fshort.</p>

<p>Without showing the transfered bytes, this string also
fits into 80 chars:</p>

<p>&quot; %X %D %16.16H %T %-25.25F %U&quot;</p>

<p>It is included as REPFMTNIO.</p>

<p>-FX format format strings can be specified in isdn.conf;
this option is used to select one of these. Entries can be
defined in the sec- tion [ISDNLOG] with names beginning with
&quot;REPFMT&quot;. The string after the -F option is added
to REPFMT to find the correct entry. Case is not sensitive.
E.g.:</p>

<p>REPFMT1 = ... # -&gt; isdnrep -F1 REPFMTMYSTRING = ... #
-&gt; isdnrep -Fmystring or isdnrep -F MYSTRING</p>

<p>HTML USE isdnrep can generate a HTML page containing
links to files generated by vbox and mgetty (faxes), so that
the messages and faxes can be heard or seen from within a
browser. However, a couple of things need to be con- figured
first.</p>

<p>_______answering_machine_messages</p>

<p>The %C can be used in the isdnrep output format to make
a link to a voice recording file. For this to work, the
following entry is needed in the [ISDNLOG] section in
isdn.conf:</p>

<p>VBOXPATH= /var/spool/vbox/fred/incoming # incoming
directory pathname</p>

<p>Now isdnrep can find the file correctly. Clicking on
this link will cause the file to be sent. These files are in
ZyXEL format; the browser cannot use these directly. The
type is given by isdnrep as follows:</p>

<p>Content-Type: application/x-zyxel4</p>

<p>The correct application (helper) for this has to be
configured in the browser. Alternatively, a conversion
program can be specified to isd- nrep which will convert the
ZyXEL format. The pathname of the file to convert is given
as a parameter to the program.</p>

<p>In the [ISDNLOG] section of isdn.conf an entry as
follows specifies which conversion program to use:</p>

<p>VBOXCMD1 = /usr/bin/program1</p>

<p>for versions 0.x and 1.x of vbox, and</p>

<p>VBOXCMD2 = /usr/bin/program2</p>

<p>for versions 2.x of vbox. Both entries can be given,
isdnrep recognizes which version created the recording.</p>

<p>The program must first output a line with the
content-type, followed by the data itself. To convert the
ZyXEL format into a WAV file, the fol- lowing script may be
used: #! /bin/sh ## ## script to play voice messages from
vbox-2.0 ## ## WARNING! If the paths are not set correctly,
## netscape may simply crash!</p>

<p>PATH=$PATH:&quot;path to sox&quot;:&quot;path to
pvftools&quot;:&quot;path to vbox&quot;
FILENAME1=/tmp/voxplay.$$.voc FILENAME2=/tmp/voxplay.$$.wav
VOLUME=8</p>

<p>vboxtoau &lt;$1 | autopvf | pvfamp $VOLUME | pvfcut 0.20
| pvftovoc &gt; $FILENAME1</p>

<p>sox $FILENAME1 $FILENAME2</p>

<p>echo Content-Type: audio/x-wav echo cat $FILENAME2</p>

<p>rm -f $FILENAME1 $FILENAME2</p>

<p>The script above needs the packages sox and pvftools.
Additionally, the browser needs to be told how to handle
&quot;audio/x-wav&quot;. This is done by adding the
following lines to the files listed:</p>

<p>~/.mime.types type=audio/x-wav desc=&quot;auWAV
Audio&quot; exts=&quot;wav&quot;</p>

<p>~/.mailcap audio/x-wav;/usr/bin/auplay %s</p>

<p>The package NAS (Network Audio System) may be
needed.</p>

<p>Now, when the browser is started, it will recognize WAV
files and start the corresponding program to handle these.
The WAV format has been cho- sen as this can also be played
from a Windows pc.</p>

<p>_______faxes_received_by_mgetty</p>

<p>When %G is used in the isdnrep output format, any faxes
received by mgetty will be accessible via a HTML link, in
the same manner as the ansering machine messages.</p>

<p>For the faxes the following entry in the [ISDNLOG]
section in isdn.conf is needed:</p>

<p>MGETTYPATH = /var/spool/fax/incoming</p>

<p>WARNING: if isdnrep doesnt have permission to read the
files, they will not be displayed; there will be no error
message.</p>

<p>When isdnrep passes these files back to the browser,
they have the G3 format. The following header is used to
notify the browser of this:</p>

<p>Content-Type: application/x-faxg3</p>

<p>As the browser probably doesnt understand this format,
the following changes to the files listed are needed:</p>

<p>~/.mime.types type=application/x-faxg3 desc=&quot;G3-Fax
Format&quot; exts=&quot;fax,g3&quot;</p>

<p>~/.mailcap pplication/x-faxg3;/usr/X11/bin/g3view %s</p>

<p>The program g3view has to be installed for this to
work.</p>

<p>If now the link is clicked on, the browser will
automatically start the external g3view to handle this
data.</p>

<p>If you prefer another format (instead of G3) such as
JPEG, the format has to be converted. The following entry in
the [ISDNLOG] section of isdn.conf takes care of this:</p>

<p>VBOXCMD = /usr/bin/g3tojpeg # example</p>

<p>The script g3tojpeg can be something like this:</p>

<p>#! /bin/sh ## ## command to display faxes in a browser
## ## WARNING! If the paths are not set correctly, ##
netscape may simply crash!</p>

<p>export PATH=$PATH:&quot;path to g3topbm&quot;:&quot;path
to convert&quot;</p>

<p>echo Content-Type: image/jpeg echo</p>

<p>g3topbm &lt; $1 | convert pbm:- jpeg:-</p>

<p>The packages ImageMagick and mgetty are needed. Mgetty
is probably already installed if you want to use this
feature :-)</p>

<p>The advantage of the JPEG format is that it can also be
displayed by a browser running on a Windows pc.</p>

<p>_______summary</p>

<p>A suitable value for REPFMTWWW is</p>

<p>REPFMTWWW = &quot;%X %D %17.17H %T %-17.17F %-20.20l SI:
%S %9u %U %I %O %G %C&quot;</p>

<p>Netscape 3.0 Gold and Arena have been tested, and both
work fine with isdnrep s HTML output, although Arenas
display is not as colourful as Netscapes.</p>

<p>A known problem (which is impossible to solve
completely) is determin- ing the relationship between an
isdn connection and a fax or vbox recording. Unfortunately
the times for isdnrep, mgetty and vbox dif- fer. Isdnrep
tries to make the best guess, but its always possible that
e.g. a fax is connected to the wrong isdn connection.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE OUTPUT With the default configuration the
following output can be generated on stdout (whitespace
slightly edited for clarity):</p>

<p>TIME FORMAT For the -d and -t options, the time is
specified in the following for- mats:</p>

<p>[DD/][M]M/[[YY]YY] specifies the month or day.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<p>7/ July of the current year 8/1996 August 1996 29/6/05
June 29th 2005 6/6/ error, is not June 6th of the current
year; its June 1906</p>

<p>[D]D day of current month</p>

<p>[D]D.[M]M.[[[CC]Y]Y] specifies a day. If century or year
and century are missing, they will be taken from the current
date.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<p>23.5. May 23rd in the current year 19.01.38 January 19th
2038 16.10.1998 October 16th 1998</p>

<p>[MM]DD[hhmm[[CC]YY][.ss]] specifies an exact time.
Unspecified parts are defined as 0 when interpreted as a
begin time, and 23 or 59 when interpreted as an end
time.</p>

<p>If a year is to be specified, the hours and minutes must
also be specified.</p>

<p>The format is copied from the date command.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<p>0107 January 1st in the current year 0107173196.25
January 7th 1996 17:31:25 010717311996 January 7th 1996
17:31:00 (or 17:31:59) 12141995 error: not December 12th
1995, but December 12th of the current year at 19:95, so its
garbage.</p>

<p>Examples of time spans and their meaning:
6/95-081214381996.25 all entries between June 1st 1995
00:00:00 and August 12th 14:38:25 0912030495.20-12/95 all

current year 00:00:00 and September 8th in the current year
23:59:59 3 third day of the current month</p>

<p>[CC]YY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss specifies a year, a moment, or
something between. Each sepera- tor &acute;- , T, and : can
be omitted or not. If the first - is missing, the century
must be given.</p>

<p>This notation cannot be combined with the above
notations. Time spans are noted with -- instead of -. If no
-- is given, &acute;i must be noted after the -t option.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<p>i2002 the entire year 2002 from January 1st 00:00:00 to
Decem- ber 31st 23:59:59 i200306 the entire month June 2003

2003 200306 error: neither i nor -- given 2003-1-4 error:
leading zeros (at month and day) must not omitted</p>

<p>&quot;y&quot; yesterday, &quot;yy&quot; the day before
yesterday, &quot;yyy&quot; three days ago and so on. For
