<p>SHMDT(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual SHMDT(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME shmdt - XSI shared memory detach operation</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/shm.h&gt;</p>

<p>int shmdt(const void *shmaddr);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The shmdt() function operates on XSI shared
memory (see the Base Defi- nitions volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001, Section 3.340, Shared Memory Object). It is
unspecified whether this function interoperates with the
realtime interprocess communication facilities defined in
Realtime .</p>

<p>The shmdt() function detaches the shared memory segment
located at the address specified by shmaddr from the address
space of the calling pro- cess.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, shmdt() shall
decrement the value of shm_nattch in the data structure
associated with the shared memory ID of the attached shared
memory segment and return 0.</p>

<p>Otherwise, the shared memory segment shall not be
detached, shmdt() shall return -1, and errno shall be set to
indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The shmdt() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The value of shmaddr is not the data segment
start address of a shared memory segment.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The POSIX Realtime Extension defines
alternative interfaces for inter- process communication.
Application developers who need to use IPC should design
their applications so that modules using the IPC routines
described in XSI Interprocess Communication can be easily
modified to use the alternative interfaces.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
