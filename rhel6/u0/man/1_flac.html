<p>FLAC(1) FLAC(1)</p>

<p>NAME flac - Free Lossless Audio Codec</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS flac [ OPTIONS ] [ infile.wav | infile.aiff |
infile.raw | infile.flac | infile.oga | infile.ogg | - ...
]</p>

<p>flac [ -d | --decode | -t | --test | -a | --analyze ] [
OPTIONS ] [ infile.flac | infile.oga | infile.ogg | - ...
]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION flac is a command-line tool for encoding,
decoding, testing and analyz- ing FLAC streams.</p>

<p>OPTIONS A summary of options is included below. For a
complete description, see the HTML documentation.</p>

<p>GENERAL OPTIONS -v, --version Show the flac version
number</p>

<p>-h, --help Show basic usage and a list of all
options</p>

<p>-H, --explain Show detailed explanation of usage and all
options</p>

<p>-d, --decode Decode (the default behavior is to
encode)</p>

<p>-t, --test Test a flac encoded file (same as -d except
no decoded file is written)</p>

<p>-a, --analyze Analyze a FLAC encoded file (same as -d
except an analysis file is written)</p>

<p>-c, --stdout Write output to stdout</p>

<p>-s, --silent Silent mode (do not write runtime
encode/decode statistics to stderr)</p>

<p>--totally-silent Do not print anything of any kind,
including warnings or errors. The exit code will be the only
way to determine successful com- pletion.</p>

<p>--no-utf8-convert Do not convert tags from local charset
to UTF-8. This is useful for scripts, and setting tags in
situations where the locale is wrong. This option must
appear before any tag options!</p>

<p>-w, --warnings-as-errors Treat all warnings as errors
(which cause flac to terminate with a non-zero exit
code).</p>

<p>-f, --force Force overwriting of output files. By
default, flac warns that the output file already exists and
continues to the next file.</p>

<p>-o filename, --output-name=filename Force the output
file name (usually flac just changes the exten- sion). May
only be used when encoding a single file. May not be used in
conjunction with --output-prefix.</p>

<p>--output-prefix=string Prefix each output file name with
the given string. This can be useful for encoding or
decoding files to a different directory. Make sure if your
string is a path name that it ends with a trailing /
(slash).</p>

<p>--delete-input-file Automatically delete the input file
after a successful encode or decode. If there was an error
(including a verify error) the input file is left
intact.</p>

<p>--keep-foreign-metadata If encoding, save WAVE or AIFF
non-audio chunks in FLAC meta- data. If decoding, restore
any saved non-audio chunks from FLAC metadata when writing
the decoded file. Foreign metadata cannot be transcoded,
e.g. WAVE chunks saved in a FLAC file cannot be restored
when decoding to AIFF. Input and output must be regu- lar
files (not stdin or stdout).</p>

<p>--skip={#|mm:ss.ss} Skip over the first number of
samples of the input. This works for both encoding and
decoding, but not testing. The alterna- tive form mm:ss.ss
can be used to specify minutes, seconds, and fractions of a
second.</p>

<p>--until={#|[+|-]mm:ss.ss} Stop at the given sample
number for each input file. This works for both encoding and
decoding, but not testing. The given sam- ple number is not
included in the decoded output. The alterna- tive form
mm:ss.ss can be used to specify minutes, seconds, and
fractions of a second. If a + (plus) sign is at the begin-
ning, the --until point is relative to the --skip point. If
a - (minus) sign is at the beginning, the --until point is
rela- tive to end of the audio.</p>

<p>--ogg When encoding, generate Ogg FLAC output instead of
native FLAC. Ogg FLAC streams are FLAC streams wrapped in an
Ogg transport layer. The resulting file should have an .oga
extension and will still be decodable by flac.</p>

<p>When decoding, force the input to be treated as Ogg
FLAC. This is useful when piping input from stdin or when
the filename does not end in .oga or .ogg.</p>

<p>--serial-number=# When used with --ogg, specifies the
serial number to use for the first Ogg FLAC stream, which is
then incremented for each addi- tional stream. When encoding
and no serial number is given, flac uses a random number for
the first stream, then increments it for each additional
stream. When decoding and no number is given, flac uses the
serial number of the first page.</p>

<p>ANALYSIS OPTIONS --residual-text Includes the residual
signal in the analysis file. This will make the file very
big, much larger than even the decoded file.</p>

<p>--residual-gnuplot Generates a gnuplot file for every
subframe; each file will con- tain the residual distribution
of the subframe. This will cre- ate a lot of files.</p>

<p>DECODING OPTIONS --cue=[#.#][-[#.#]] Set the beginning
and ending cuepoints to decode. The optional first #.# is
the track and index point at which decoding will start; the
default is the beginning of the stream. The optional second
#.# is the track and index point at which decoding will end;
the default is the end of the stream. If the cuepoint does
not exist, the closest one before it (for the start point)
or after it (for the end point) will be used. If those dont
exist, the start of the stream (for the start point) or end
of the stream (for the end point) will be used. The
cuepoints are merely translated into sample numbers then
used as --skip and --until. A CD track can always be cued
by, for example, --cue=9.1-10.1 for track 9, even if the CD
has no 10th track.</p>

<p>-F, --decode-through-errors By default flac stops
decoding with an error and removes the partially decoded
file if it encounters a bitstream error. With -F, errors are
still printed but flac will continue decoding to completion.
Note that errors may cause the decoded audio to be missing
some samples or have silent sections.</p>

<p>ENCODING OPTIONS -V, --verify Verify a correct encoding
by decoding the output in parallel and comparing to the
original</p>

<p>--lax Allow encoder to generate non-Subset files. The
resulting FLAC file may not be streamable or might have
trouble being played in all players (especially hardware
devices), so you should only use this option in combination
with custom encoding options meant for archival.</p>

<p>--replay-gain Calculate ReplayGain values and store them
as FLAC tags, similar to vorbisgain. Title gains/peaks will
be computed for each input file, and an album gain/peak will
be computed for all files. All input files must have the
same resolution, sample rate, and number of channels. Only
mono and stereo files are allowed, and the sample rate must
be one of 8, 11.025, 12, 16, 22.05, 24, 32, 44.1, or 48 kHz.
Also note that this option may leave a few extra bytes in a
PADDING block as the exact size of the tags is not known
until all files are processed. Note that this option cannot
be used when encoding to standard output (stdout).</p>

<p>--cuesheet=filename Import the given cuesheet file and
store it in a CUESHEET meta- data block. This option may
only be used when encoding a single file. A seekpoint will
be added for each index point in the cuesheet to the
SEEKTABLE unless --no-cued-seekpoints is speci- fied.</p>

<p>--picture={FILENAME|SPECIFICATION} Import a picture and
store it in a PICTURE metadata block. More than one
--picture command can be specified. Either a filename for
the picture file or a more complete specification form can
be used. The SPECIFICATION is a string whose parts are sepa-
rated by | (pipe) characters. Some parts may be left empty
to invoke default values. FILENAME is just shorthand for
&quot;||||FILENAME&quot;. The format of SPECIFICATION is</p>


<p>[TYPE]|[MIME-TYPE]|[DESCRIPTION]|[WIDTHxHEIGHTxDEPTH[/COL-
ORS]]|FILE</p>

<p>TYPE is optional; it is a number from one of:</p>

<p>0: Other</p>

<p>1: 32x32 pixels file icon (PNG only)</p>

<p>2: Other file icon</p>

<p>3: Cover (front)</p>

<p>4: Cover (back)</p>

<p>5: Leaflet page</p>

<p>6: Media (e.g. label side of CD)</p>

<p>7: Lead artist/lead performer/soloist</p>

<p>8: Artist/performer</p>

<p>9: Conductor</p>

<p>10: Band/Orchestra</p>

<p>11: Composer</p>

<p>12: Lyricist/text writer</p>

<p>13: Recording Location</p>

<p>14: During recording</p>

<p>15: During performance</p>

<p>16: Movie/video screen capture</p>

<p>17: A bright coloured fish</p>

<p>18: Illustration</p>

<p>19: Band/artist logotype</p>

<p>20: Publisher/Studio logotype</p>

<p>The default is 3 (front cover). There may only be one
picture each of type 1 and 2 in a file.</p>

<p>MIME-TYPE is optional; if left blank, it will be
detected from the file. For best compatibility with players,
use pictures with MIME type image/jpeg or image/png. The
MIME type can also be --&gt; to mean that FILE is actually a
URL to an image, though this use is discouraged.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION is optional; the default is an empty
string.</p>

<p>The next part specfies the resolution and color
information. If the MIME-TYPE is image/jpeg, image/png, or
image/gif, you can usually leave this empty and they can be
detected from the file. Otherwise, you must specify the
width in pixels, height in pix- els, and color depth in
bits-per-pixel. If the image has indexed colors you should
also specify the number of colors used. When manually
specified, it is not checked against the file for
accuracy.</p>

<p>FILE is the path to the picture file to be imported, or
the URL if MIME type is --&gt;</p>

<p>For example, &quot;|image/jpeg|||../cover.jpg&quot; will
embed the JPEG file at ../cover.jpg, defaulting to type 3
(front cover) and an empty description. The resolution and
color info will be retrieved from the file itself.</p>

<p>The specification
&quot;4|--&gt;|CD|320x300x24/173|http://blah.blah/backcover.tiff&quot;
will embed the given URL, with type 4 (back cover),
description &quot;CD&quot;, and a manually specified
resolution of 320x300, 24 bits-per- pixel, and 173 colors.
The file at the URL will not be fetched; the URL itself is
stored in the PICTURE metadata block.</p>

<p>--sector-align Align encoding of multiple CD format
files on sector boundaries. See the HTML documentation for
more information.</p>

<p>-S {#|X|#x|#s}, --seekpoint={#|X|#x|#s} Include a point
or points in a SEEKTABLE. Using #, a seek point at that
sample number is added. Using X, a placeholder point is
added at the end of a the table. Using #x, # evenly spaced
seek points will be added, the first being at sample 0.
Using #s, a seekpoint will be added every # seconds (# does
not have to be a whole number; it can be, for example, 9.5,
meaning a seekpoint every 9.5 seconds). You may use many -S
options; the resulting SEEKTABLE will be the unique-ified
union of all such values. With no -S options, flac defaults
to -S 10s. Use --no-seek- table for no SEEKTABLE. Note: -S
#x and -S #s will not work if the encoder can t determine
the input size before starting. Note: if you use -S # and #
is &gt;= samples in the input, there will be either no seek
point entered (if the input size is determinable before
encoding starts) or a placeholder point (if input size is
not determinable).</p>

<p>-P #, --padding=# Tell the encoder to write a PADDING
metadata block of the given length (in bytes) after the
STREAMINFO block. This is useful if you plan to tag the file
later with an APPLICATION block; instead of having to
rewrite the entire file later just to insert your block, you
can write directly over the PADDING block. Note that the
total length of the PADDING block will be 4 bytes longer
than the length given because of the 4 metadata block header
bytes. You can force no PADDING block at all to be written
with --no-padding. The encoder writes a PADDING block of
8192 bytes by default (or 65536 bytes if the input audio
stream is more that 20 minutes long).</p>

<p>-T FIELD=VALUE, --tag=FIELD=VALUE Add a FLAC tag. The
comment must adhere to the Vorbis comment spec; i.e. the
FIELD must contain only legal characters, termi- nated by an
equals sign. Make sure to quote the comment if necessary.
This option may appear more than once to add several
comments. NOTE: all tags will be added to all encoded
files.</p>

<p>--tag-from-file=FIELD=FILENAME Like --tag, except
FILENAME is a file whose contents will be read verbatim to
set the tag value. The contents will be con- verted to UTF-8
from the local charset. This can be used to store a cuesheet
in a tag (e.g. --tag-from-
file=&quot;CUESHEET=image.cue&quot;). Do not try to store
binary data in tag fields! Use APPLICATION blocks for
that.</p>

<p>-b #, --blocksize=# Specify the block size in samples.
Subset streams must use one of 192, 576, 1152, 2304, 4608,
256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096 (and 8192 or 16384 if the sample
rate is &gt;48kHz).</p>

<p>-m, --mid-side Try mid-side coding for each frame
(stereo input only)</p>

<p>-M, --adaptive-mid-side Adaptive mid-side coding for all
frames (stereo input only)</p>

<p>-0..-8, --compression-level-0..--compression-level-8
Fastest compression..highest compression (default is -5).
These are synonyms for other options:</p>

<p>-0, --compression-level-0 Synonymous with -l 0 -b 1152
-r 3</p>

<p>-1, --compression-level-1 Synonymous with -l 0 -b 1152
-M -r 3</p>

<p>-2, --compression-level-2 Synonymous with -l 0 -b 1152
-m -r 3</p>

<p>-3, --compression-level-3 Synonymous with -l 6 -b 4096
-r 4</p>

<p>-4, --compression-level-4 Synonymous with -l 8 -b 4096
-M -r 4</p>

<p>-5, --compression-level-5 Synonymous with -l 8 -b 4096
-m -r 5</p>

<p>-6, --compression-level-6 Synonymous with -l 8 -b 4096
-m -r 6</p>

<p>-7, --compression-level-7 Synonymous with -l 8 -b 4096
-m -e -r 6</p>

<p>-8, --compression-level-8 Synonymous with -l 12 -b 4096
-m -e -r 6</p>

<p>--fast Fastest compression. Currently synonymous with
-0.</p>

<p>--best Highest compression. Currently synonymous with
-8.</p>

<p>-e, --exhaustive-model-search Do exhaustive model search
(expensive!)</p>

<p>-A function, --apodization=function Window audio data
with given the apodization function. The functions are:
bartlett, bartlett_hann, blackman, blackman_har-
ris_4term_92db, connes, flattop, gauss(STDDEV), hamming,
hann, kaiser_bessel, nuttall, rectangle, triangle, tukey(P),
welch.</p>

<p>For gauss(STDDEV), STDDEV is the standard deviation
(0&lt;STD- DEV&lt;=0.5).</p>

<p>For tukey(P), P specifies the fraction of the window
that is tapered (0&lt;=P&lt;=1; P=0 corresponds to
&quot;rectangle&quot; and P=1 corre- sponds to
&quot;hann&quot;).</p>

<p>More than one -A option (up to 32) may be used. Any
function that is specified erroneously is silently dropped.
The encoder chooses suitable defaults in the absence of any
-A options; any -A option specified replaces the
default(s).</p>

<p>When more than one function is specified, then for every
sub- frame the encoder will try each of them separately and
choose the window that results in the smallest compressed
subframe. Multiple functions can greatly increase the
encoding time.</p>

<p>-l #, --max-lpc-order=# Specifies the maximum LPC order.
This number must be &lt;= 32. For Subset streams, it must be
&lt;=12 if the sample rate is &lt;=48kHz. If 0, the encoder
will not attempt generic linear prediction, and use only
fixed predictors. Using fixed predictors is faster but
usually results in files being 5-10% larger.</p>

<p>-p, --qlp-coeff-precision-search Do exhaustive search of
LP coefficient quantization (expen- sive!). Overrides -q;
does nothing if using -l 0</p>

<p>-q #, --qlp-coeff-precision=# Precision of the quantized
linear-predictor coefficients, 0 =&gt; let encoder decide
(min is 5, default is 0)</p>

<p>-r [#,]#, --rice-partition-order=[#,]# Set the [min,]max
residual partition order (0..16). min defaults to 0 if
unspecified. Default is -r 5.</p>

<p>FORMAT OPTIONS --endian={big|little} Set the byte order
for samples</p>

<p>--channels=# Set number of channels.</p>

<p>--bps=# Set bits per sample.</p>

<p>--sample-rate=# Set sample rate (in Hz).</p>

<p>--sign={signed|unsigned} Set the sign of samples (the
default is signed).</p>

<p>--input-size=# Specify the size of the raw input in
bytes. If you are encoding raw samples from stdin, you must
set this option in order to be able to use --skip, --until,
--cue-sheet, or other options that need to know the size of
the input beforehand. If the size given is greater than what
is found in the input stream, the encoder will complain
about an unexpected end-of-file. If the size given is less,
samples will be truncated.</p>

<p>--force-aiff-format Force the decoder to output AIFF
format. This option is not needed if the output filename (as
set by -o) ends with .aiff. Also, this option has no effect
when encoding since input AIFF is auto-detected.</p>

<p>--force-raw-format Force input (when encoding) or output
(when decoding) to be treated as raw samples (even if
filename ends in .wav).</p>

<p>NEGATIVE OPTIONS --no-adaptive-mid-side</p>

<p>--no-decode-through-errors</p>

<p>--no-delete-input-file</p>

<p>--no-exhaustive-model-search</p>

<p>--no-lax</p>

<p>--no-mid-side</p>

<p>--no-ogg</p>

<p>--no-padding</p>

<p>--no-qlp-coeff-precision-search</p>

<p>--no-residual-gnuplot</p>

<p>--no-residual-text</p>

<p>--no-sector-align</p>

<p>--no-seektable</p>

<p>--no-silent</p>

<p>--no-verify</p>

<p>--no-warnings-as-errors These flags can be used to
invert the sense of the corresponding normal option.</p>
