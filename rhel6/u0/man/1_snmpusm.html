<p>SNMPUSM(1) Net-SNMP SNMPUSM(1)</p>

<p>NAME snmpusm - creates and maintains SNMPv3 users on a
network entity</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS snmpusm [COMMON OPTIONS] create USER
[CLONEFROM-USER] snmpusm [COMMON OPTIONS] delete USER
snmpusm [COMMON OPTIONS] cloneFrom USER CLONEFROM-USER
snmpusm [COMMON OPTIONS] [-Ca] [-Cx] passwd OLD-PASSPHRASE
NEW- PASSPHRASE [USER] snmpusm [COMMON OPTIONS] &lt;-Ca |
-Cx&gt; -Ck passwd OLD-KEY-OR-PASSPHRASE
NEW-KEY-OR-PASSPHRASE [USER] snmpusm [COMMON OPTIONS] [-Ca]
[-Cx] changekey [USER]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION snmpusm is an SNMP application that can be
used to do simple mainte- nance on the users known to an
SNMP agent, by manipulating the agents User-based Security
Module (USM) table. The user needs write access to the
usmUserTable MIB table. This tool can be used to create,
delete, clone, and change the passphrase of users configured
on a running SNMP agent.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Common options for all snmpusm commands:</p>

<p>-CE ENGINE-ID Set usmUserEngineID to be used as part of
the index of the usmUserTable. Default is to use the
contextEngineID (set via -E or probed) as the
usmUserEngineID.</p>

<p>-Cp STRING Set the usmUserPublic value of the (new) user
to the specified STRING.</p>

<p>Options for the passwd and changekey commands:</p>

<p>-Ca Change the authentication key.</p>

<p>-Cx Change the privacy key.</p>

<p>-Ck Allows to use localized key (must start with 0x)
instead of passphrase. When this option is used, either the
-Ca or -Cx option (but not both) must also be used.</p>

<p>CREATING USERS An unauthenticated SNMPv3 user can be
created using the command</p>

<p>snmpusm [OPTIONS] create USER</p>

<p>This constructs an (inactive) entry in the usmUserTable,
with no authentication or privacy settings. In principle,
this user should be useable for noAuthNoPriv requests, but
in practise the Net-SNMP agent will not allow such an entry
to be made active.</p>

<p>In order to activate this entry, it is necessary to
&quot;clone&quot; an existing user, using the command</p>

<p>snmpusm [OPTIONS] cloneFrom USER CLONEFROM-USER</p>

<p>The USER entry then inherits the same authentication and
privacy set- tings (including pass phrases) as the CLONEFROM
user.</p>

<p>These two steps can be combined into one, by using the
command</p>

<p>snmpusm [OPTIONS] create USER CLONEFROM-USER</p>

<p>The two forms of the create sub-command require that the
user being created does not already exist. The cloneFrom
sub-command requires that the user being cloned to does
already exist.</p>

<p>Cloning is the only way to specify which authentication
and privacy protocols to use for a given user, and it is
only possible to do this once. Subsequent attempts to
reclone onto the same user will appear to succeed, but will
be silently ignored. This (somewhat unexpected) behaviour is
mandated by the SNMPv3 USM specifications (RFC 3414). To
change the authentication and privacy settings for a given
user, it is necessary to delete and recreate the user entry.
This is not necessary for simply changing the pass phrases
(see below). This means that the agent must be initialized
with at least one user for each combination of
authentication and privacy protocols. See the snmpd.conf(5)
manual page for details of the createUser configuration
directive.</p>

<p>DELETING USERS A user can be deleted from the
usmUserTable using the command</p>

<p>snmpusm [OPTIONS] delete USER</p>

<p>CHANGING PASS PHRASES User profiles contain private keys
that are never transmitted over the wire in clear text
(regardless of whether the administration requests are
encrypted or not). To change the secret key for a user, it
is nec- essary to specify the users old passphrase as well
as the new one. This uses the command</p>

<p>snmpusm [OPTIONS] [-Ca] [-Cx] passwd OLD-PASSPHRASE NEW-
PASSPHRASE [USER]</p>

<p>After cloning a new user entry from the appropriate
template, you should immediately change the new users
passphrase.</p>

<p>If USER is not specified, this command will change the
passphrase of the (SNMPv3) user issuing the command. If the
-Ca or -Cx options are specified, then only the
authentication or privacy keys are changed. If these options
are not specified, then both the authentication and privacy
keys are changed.</p>

<p>snmpusm [OPTIONS] [-Ca] [-Cx] changekey [USER]</p>

<p>This command changes the key in a
perfect-forward-secrecy compliant way through a
diffie-helman exchange. The remote agent must support the
SNMP-USM-DH-OBJECTS-MIB for this command to work. The
resulting keys are printed to the console and may be then
set in future command invo- cations using the
--defAuthLocalizedKey and --defPrivLocalizedKey options or
in your snmp.conf file using the defAuthLocalizedKey and
defPrivLocalizedKey keywords.</p>

<p>Note that since these keys are randomly generated based
on a diffie helman exchange, they are no longer derived from
a more easily typed password. They are, however, much more
secure.</p>

<p>To change from a localized key back to a password, the
following vari- ant of the passwd sub-command is used:</p>

<p>snmpusm [OPTIONS] &lt;-Ca | -Cx&gt; -Ck passwd
OLD-KEY-OR-PASSPHRASE NEW-KEY-OR-PASSPHRASE [USER]</p>

<p>Either the -Ca or the -Cx option must be specified. The
OLD-KEY-OR- PASSPHRASE and/or NEW-KEY-OR-PASSPHRASE
arguments can either be a passphrase or a localized key
starting with &quot;0x&quot;, e.g. as printed out by the
changekey sub-command.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Let s assume for our examples that the
following VACM and USM configu- rations lines were in the
snmpd.conf file for a Net-SNMP agent. These lines set up a
default user called &quot;initial&quot; with the
authentication passphrase &quot;setup_passphrase&quot; so
that we can perform the initial setup of an agent:</p>

<p># VACM configuration entries rwuser initial # lets add
the new user well create too: rwuser wes # USM configuration
entries createUser initial MD5 setup_passphrase DES</p>

<p>Note: the &quot;initial&quot; user s setup should be
removed after creating a real user that you grant
administrative privileges to (like the user &quot;wes&quot;
well be creating in this example.</p>

<p>Note: passphrases must be 8 characters minimum in
length.</p>

<p>Create a new user snmpusm -v3 -u initial -n &quot;&quot;
-l authNoPriv -a MD5 -A setup_passphrase localhost create
wes initial</p>

<p>Creates a new user, here named &quot;wes&quot; using the
user &quot;initial&quot; to do it. &quot;wes&quot; is cloned
from &quot;initial&quot; in the process, so he inherits that
user s passphrase (&quot;setup_passphrase&quot;).</p>

<p>Change the uses passphrase snmpusm -v 3 -u wes -n
&quot;&quot; -l authNoPriv -a MD5 -A setup_passphrase
localhost passwd setup_passphrase new_passphrase</p>

<p>After creating the user &quot;wes&quot; with the same
passphrase as the &quot;initial&quot; user, we need to
change his passphrase for him. The above command changes it
from &quot;setup_passphrase&quot;, which was inherited from
the initial user, to &quot;new_passphrase&quot;.</p>

<p>Test the new user snmpget -v 3 -u wes -n &quot;&quot; -l
authNoPriv -a MD5 -A new_passphrase local- host
sysUpTime.0</p>

<p>If the above commands were successful, this command
should have properly performed an authenticated SNMPv3 GET
request to the agent.</p>

<p>Now, go remove the vacm &quot;group&quot; snmpd.conf
entry for the &quot;initial&quot; user and you have a valid
user wes that you can use for future transac- tions instead
of initial.</p>

<p>WARNING Manipulating the usmUserTable using this command
can only be done using SNMPv3. This command will not work
with the community-based versions, even if they have write
access to the table.</p>
