<p>NAME vfs_prealloc - preallocate matching files to a
predetermined size</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS vfs objects = prealloc</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This VFS module is part of the samba(7)
suite.</p>

<p>The vfs_prealloc VFS module preallocates files to a
specified size each time a new file is created. This is
useful in environments where files are of a predetermined
size will be written to a disk subsystem where extending
file allocations is expensive.</p>

<p>This module is stackable.</p>

<p>OPTIONS prealloc:EXT = BYTES Preallocate all files with
the extension EXT to the size specified by BYTES.</p>

<p>The following suffixes may be applied to BYTES:</p>

<p>&middot; K - BYTES is a number of kilobytes</p>

<p>&middot; M - BYTES is a number of megabytes</p>

<p>&middot; G - BYTES is a number of gigabytes</p>

<p>EXAMPLES A process writes TIFF files to a Samba share,
and the is known these files will almost always be around 4
megabytes (4194304 bytes):</p>

<p>[frames] path = /data/frames vfs objects = prealloc
prealloc:tiff = 4M</p>

<p>CAVEATS vfs_prealloc is not supported on all platforms
and filesystems. Currently only XFS filesystems on Linux and
IRIX are supported.</p>

<p>VERSION This man page is correct for version 3.0.25 of
the Samba suite.</p>

<p>AUTHOR The original Samba software and related utilities
were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by
the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way
the Linux kernel is developed.</p>
