<p>XSetICFocus(3) XLIB FUNCTIONS XSetICFocus(3)</p>

<p>NAME XSetICFocus, XUnsetICFocus - set and unset input
context focus</p>

<p>SYNTAX void XSetICFocus(XIC ic);</p>

<p>void XUnsetICFocus(XIC ic);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS ic Specifies the input context.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The XSetICFocus function allows a client to
notify an input method that the focus window attached to the
specified input context has received keyboard focus. The
input method should take action to provide appro- priate
feedback. Complete feedback specification is a matter of
user interface policy.</p>

<p>Calling XSetICFocus does not affect the focus window
value.</p>

<p>The XUnsetICFocus function allows a client to notify an
input method that the specified input context has lost the
keyboard focus and that no more input is expected on the
focus window attached to that input context. The input
method should take action to provide appropriate feedback.
Complete feedback specification is a matter of user inter-
face policy.</p>

<p>Calling XUnsetICFocus does not affect the focus window
value; the client may still receive events from the input
method that are directed to the focus window.</p>
