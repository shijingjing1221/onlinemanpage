<p>SMBPASSWD(5) File Formats and Conventions
SMBPASSWD(5)</p>

<p>NAME smbpasswd - The Samba encrypted password file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS smbpasswd</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This tool is part of the samba(7) suite.</p>

<p>smbpasswd is the Samba encrypted password file. It
contains the username, Unix user id and the SMB hashed
passwords of the user, as well as account flag information
and the time the password was last changed. This file format
has been evolving with Samba and has had several different
formats in the past.</p>

<p>FILE FORMAT The format of the smbpasswd file used by
Samba 2.2 is very similar to the familiar Unix passwd(5)
file. It is an ASCII file containing one line for each user.
Each field ithin each line is separated from the next by a
colon. Any entry beginning with &acute;#&acute; is ignored.
The smbpasswd file contains the following information for
each user:</p>

<p>name This is the user name. It must be a name that
already exists in the standard UNIX passwd file.</p>

<p>uid This is the UNIX uid. It must match the uid field
for the same user entry in the standard UNIX passwd file. If
this does not match then Samba will refuse to recognize this
smbpasswd file entry as being valid for a user.</p>

<p>Lanman Password Hash This is the LANMAN hash of the
user&acute;s password, encoded as 32 hex digits. The LANMAN
hash is created by DES encrypting a well known string with
the user&acute;s password as the DES key. This is the same
password used by Windows 95/98 machines. Note that this
password hash is regarded as weak as it is vulnerable to
dictionary attacks and if two users choose the same password
this entry will be identical (i.e. the password is not
&quot;salted&quot; as the UNIX password is). If the user has
a null password this field will contain the characters
&quot;NO PASSWORD&quot; as the start of the hex string. If
the hex string is equal to 32 &acute;X&acute; characters
then the user&acute;s account is marked as disabled and the
user will not be able to log onto the Samba server.</p>

<p>WARNING !! Note that, due to the challenge-response
nature of the SMB/CIFS authentication protocol, anyone with
a knowledge of this password hash will be able to
impersonate the user on the network. For this reason these
hashes are known as plain text equivalents and must NOT be
made available to anyone but the root user. To protect these
passwords the smbpasswd file is placed in a directory with
read and traverse access only to the root user and the
smbpasswd file itself must be set to be read/write only by
root, with no other access.</p>

<p>NT Password Hash This is the Windows NT hash of the
user&acute;s password, encoded as 32 hex digits. The Windows
NT hash is created by taking the user&acute;s password as
represented in 16-bit, little-endian UNICODE and then
applying the MD4 (internet rfc1321) hashing algorithm to
it.</p>

<p>This password hash is considered more secure than the
LANMAN Password Hash as it preserves the case of the
password and uses a much higher quality hashing algorithm.
However, it is still the case that if two users choose the
same password this entry will be identical (i.e. the
password is not &quot;salted&quot; as the UNIX password
is).</p>

<p>WARNING !!. Note that, due to the challenge-response
nature of the SMB/CIFS authentication protocol, anyone with
a knowledge of this password hash will be able to
impersonate the user on the network. For this reason these
hashes are known as plain text equivalents and must NOT be
made available to anyone but the root user. To protect these
passwords the smbpasswd file is placed in a directory with
read and traverse access only to the root user and the
smbpasswd file itself must be set to be read/write only by
root, with no other access.</p>

<p>Account Flags This section contains flags that describe
the attributes of the users account. This field is bracketed
by &acute;[&acute; and &acute;]&acute; characters and is
always 13 characters in length (including the
&acute;[&acute; and &acute;]&acute; characters). The
contents of this field may be any of the following
characters:</p>

<p>&middot; U - This means this is a &quot;User&quot;
account, i.e. an ordinary user.</p>

<p>&middot; N - This means the account has no password (the
passwords in the fields LANMAN Password Hash and NT Password
Hash are ignored). Note that this will only allow users to
log on with no password if the null passwords parameter is
set in the smb.conf(5) config file.</p>

<p>&middot; D - This means the account is disabled and no
SMB/CIFS logins will be allowed for this user.</p>

<p>&middot; X - This means the password does not
expire.</p>

<p>&middot; W - This means this account is a
&quot;Workstation Trust&quot; account. This kind of account
is used in the Samba PDC code stream to allow Windows NT
Workstations and Servers to join a Domain hosted by a Samba
PDC.</p>

<p>Other flags may be added as the code is extended in
future. The rest of this field space is filled in with
spaces. For further information regarding the flags that are
supported please refer to the man page for the pdbedit
command.</p>

<p>Last Change Time This field consists of the time the
account was last modified. It consists of the characters
&acute;LCT-&acute; (standing for &quot;Last Change
Time&quot;) followed by a numeric encoding of the UNIX time
in seconds since the epoch (1970) that the last change was
made.</p>

<p>All other colon separated fields are ignored at this
time.</p>

<p>VERSION This man page is correct for version 3 of the
Samba suite.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO smbpasswd(8), Samba(7), and the Internet
RFC1321 for details on the MD4 algorithm.</p>

<p>AUTHOR The original Samba software and related utilities
were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by
the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way
the Linux kernel is developed.</p>

<p>The original Samba man pages were written by Karl Auer.
The man page sources were converted to YODL format (another
excellent piece of Open Source software, available at
ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/) and updated for the Samba
2.0 release by Jeremy Allison. The conversion to DocBook for
Samba 2.2 was done by Gerald Carter. The conversion to
DocBook XML 4.2 for Samba 3.0 was done by Alexander
Bokovoy.</p>
