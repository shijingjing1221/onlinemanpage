<p>QRERUN(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual QRERUN(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME qrerun - rerun batch jobs</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS qrerun job_identifier ...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION To rerun a batch job is to terminate the
session leader of the batch job, delete any associated
checkpoint files, and return the batch job to the batch
queued state. A batch job is rerun by a request to the batch
server that manages the batch job. The qrerun utility is a
user- accessible batch client that requests the rerunning of
one or more batch jobs.</p>

<p>The qrerun utility shall rerun those batch jobs for
which a batch job_identifier is presented to the
utility.</p>

<p>The qrerun utility shall rerun batch jobs in the order
in which their batch job_identifiers are presented to the
utility.</p>

<p>If the qrerun utility fails to process any batch
job_identifier suc- cessfully, the utility shall proceed to
process the remaining batch job_identifiers, if any.</p>

<p>The qrerun utility shall rerun batch jobs by sending a
Rerun Job Request to the batch server that manages each
batch job.</p>

<p>For each successfully processed batch job_identifier,
the qrerun util- ity shall have rerun the corresponding
batch job at the time the util- ity exits.</p>

<p>OPTIONS None.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The qrerun utility shall accept one or more
operands that conform to the syntax for a batch
job_identifier (see Batch Job Identifier ).</p>

<p>STDIN Not used.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of qre- run:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in
arguments).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>LOGNAME Determine the login name of the user.</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT None.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 Successful completion.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS In addition to the default
behavior, the qrerun utility shall not be required to write
a diagnostic message to standard error when the error reply
received from a batch server indicates that the batch
job_identi- fier does not exist on the server. Whether or
not the qrerun utility waits to output the diagnostic
message while attempting to locate the job on other servers
is implementation-defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The qrerun utility allows users to cause jobs
in the running state to exit and rerun.</p>

<p>The qrerun utility is a new utility, vis-a-vis existing
practice, that has been defined in this volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001 to correct user-perceived deficiencies in the
existing practice.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
