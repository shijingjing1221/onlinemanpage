<p>SYSCALL_ROLLBACK(9) Machine State
SYSCALL_ROLLBACK(9)</p>

<p>NAME syscall_rollback - roll back registers after an
aborted system call</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS void syscall_rollback(struct task_struct *
task, struct pt_regs * regs);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS task task of interest, must be in system call
exit tracing</p>

<p>regs</p>

<p>task_pt_regs of task</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION It&acute;s only valid to call this when task
is stopped for system call exit tracing (due to
TIF_SYSCALL_TRACE or TIF_SYSCALL_AUDIT), after
tracehook_report_syscall_entry returned nonzero to prevent
the system call from taking place.</p>

<p>This rolls back the register state in regs so it&acute;s
as if the system call instruction was a no-op. The registers
containing the system call number and arguments are as they
were before the system call instruction. This may not be the
same as what the register state looked like at system call
entry tracing.</p>
