<p>GITCLI(7) Git Manual GITCLI(7)</p>

<p>NAME gitcli - git command line interface and
conventions</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS gitcli</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual describes the convention used
throughout git CLI.</p>

<p>Many commands take revisions (most often
&quot;commits&quot;, but sometimes &quot;tree-ish&quot;,
depending on the context and command) and paths as their
arguments. Here are the rules:</p>

<p>&middot; Revisions come first and then paths. E.g. in
git diff v1.0 v2.0 arch/x86 include/asm-x86, v1.0 and v2.0
are revisions and arch/x86 and include/asm-x86 are
paths.</p>

<p>&middot; When an argument can be misunderstood as either
a revision or a path, they can be disambiguated by placing
-- between them. E.g. git diff -- HEAD is, &quot;I have a
file called HEAD in my work tree. Please show changes
between the version I staged in the index and what I have in
the work tree for that file&quot;. not &quot;show difference
between the HEAD commit and the work tree as a whole&quot;.
You can say git diff HEAD -- to ask for the latter.</p>

<p>&middot; Without disambiguating --, git makes a
reasonable guess, but errors out and asking you to
disambiguate when ambiguous. E.g. if you have a file called
HEAD in your work tree, git diff HEAD is ambiguous, and you
have to say either git diff HEAD -- or git diff -- HEAD to
disambiguate.</p>

<p>When writing a script that is expected to handle random
user-input, it is a good practice to make it explicit which
arguments are which by placing disambiguating -- at
appropriate places.</p>

<p>Here are the rules regarding the &quot;flags&quot; that
you should follow when you are scripting git:</p>

<p>&middot; its preferred to use the non dashed form of git
commands, which means that you should prefer git foo to
git-foo.</p>

<p>&middot; splitting short options to separate words
(prefer git foo -a -b to git foo -ab, the latter may not
even work).</p>

<p>&middot; when a command line option takes an argument,
use the sticked form. In other words, write git foo -oArg
instead of git foo -o Arg for short options, and git foo
--long-opt=Arg instead of git foo --long-opt Arg for long
options. An option that takes optional option-argument must
be written in the sticked form.</p>

<p>&middot; when you give a revision parameter to a
command, make sure the parameter is not ambiguous with a
name of a file in the work tree. E.g. do not write git log
-1 HEAD but write git log -1 HEAD --; the former will not
work if you happen to have a file called HEAD in the work
tree.</p>

<p>ENHANCED OPTION PARSER From the git 1.5.4 series and
further, many git commands (not all of them at the time of
the writing though) come with an enhanced option parser.</p>

<p>Here is an exhaustive list of the facilities provided by
this option parser.</p>

<p>Magic Options Commands which have the enhanced option
parser activated all understand a couple of magic command
line options:</p>

<p>-h gives a pretty printed usage of the command.</p>

<p>$ git describe -h usage: git describe [options]
&lt;committish&gt;*</p>

<p>--contains find the tag that comes after the commit
--debug debug search strategy on stderr --all use any ref in
.git/refs --tags use any tag in .git/refs/tags --abbrev
[&lt;n&gt;] use &lt;n&gt; digits to display SHA-1s
--candidates &lt;n&gt; consider &lt;n&gt; most recent tags
(default: 10)</p>

<p>--help-all Some git commands take options that are only
used for plumbing or that are deprecated, and such options
are hidden from the default usage. This option gives the
full list of options.</p>

<p>Negating options Options with long option names can be
negated by prefixing --no-. For example, git branch has the
option --track which is on by default. You can use
--no-track to override that behaviour. The same goes for
--color and --no-color.</p>

<p>Aggregating short options Commands that support the
enhanced option parser allow you to aggregate short options.
This means that you can for example use git rm -rf or git
clean -fdx.</p>

<p>Separating argument from the option You can write the
mandatory option parameter to an option as a separate word
on the command line. That means that all the following uses
work:</p>

<p>$ git foo --long-opt=Arg $ git foo --long-opt Arg $ git
foo -oArg $ git foo -o Arg</p>

<p>However, this is NOT allowed for switches with an
optional value, where the sticked form must be used:</p>

<p>$ git describe --abbrev HEAD # correct $ git describe
--abbrev=10 HEAD # correct $ git describe --abbrev 10 HEAD #
NOT WHAT YOU MEANT</p>

<p>NOTES ON FREQUENTLY CONFUSED OPTIONS Many commands that
can work on files in the working tree and/or in the index
can take --cached and/or --index options. Sometimes people
incorrectly think that, because the index was originally
called cache, these two are synonyms. They are not these two
options mean very different things.</p>

<p>&middot; The --cached option is used to ask a command
that usually works on files in the working tree to only work
with the index. For example, git grep, when used without a
commit to specify from which commit to look for strings in,
usually works on files in the working tree, but with the
--cached option, it looks for strings in the index.</p>

<p>&middot; The --index option is used to ask a command
that usually works on files in the working tree to also
affect the index. For example, git stash apply usually
merges changes recorded in a stash to the working tree, but
with the --index option, it also merges changes to the index
as well.</p>

<p>git apply command can be used with --cached and --index
(but not at the same time). Usually the command only affects
the files in the working tree, but with --index, it patches
both the files and their index entries, and with --cached,
it modifies only the index entries.</p>
