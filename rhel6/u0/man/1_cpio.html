<p>CPIO(1L) CPIO(1L)</p>

<p>NAME cpio - copy files to and from archives</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS Copy-out mode</p>

<p>In copy-out mode, cpio copies files into an archive. It
reads a list of filenames, one per line, on the standard
input, and writes the archive onto the standard output. A
typical way to generate the list of filenames is with the
find command; you should give find the -depth option to
minimize problems with permissions on directories that are
unreadable. see Options.</p>

<p>cpio {-o|--create} [-0acvABLV] [-C bytes] [-H format]

[--block-size=blocks] [--dereference] [--io-size=bytes]
[--rsh-com- mand=command] [--help] [--version] &lt;
name-list [&gt; archive]</p>

<p>Copy-in mode</p>

<p>In copy-in mode, cpio copies files out of an archive or
lists the archive contents. It reads the archive from the
standard input. Any non-option command line arguments are
shell globbing patterns; only files in the archive whose
names match one or more of those patterns are copied from
the archive. Unlike in the shell, an initial . in a filename
does match a wildcard at the start of a pattern, and a / in
a filename can match wildcards. If no patterns are given,
all files are extracted. see Options.</p>

<p>Copy-pass mode</p>

<p>In copy-pass mode, cpio copies files from one directory
tree to another, combining the copy-out and copy-in steps
without actually using an archive. It reads the list of
files to copy from the standard input; the directory into
which it will copy them is given as a non- option argument.

<p>DESCRIPTION GNU cpio is a tool for creating and
extracting archives, or copying files from one place to
another. It handles a number of cpio formats as well as
reading and writing tar files.</p>

<p>Following archive formats are supported: binary, old
ASCII, new ASCII, crc, HPUX binary, HPUX old ASCII, old tar,
and POSIX.1 tar. The tar format is provided for
compatability with the tar program. By default, cpio creates
binary format archives, for compatibility with older cpio
programs. When extracting from archives, cpio automatically
recognizes which kind of archive it is reading and can read
archives created on machines with a different
byte-order.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -0, --null Read a list of filenames terminated
by a null character, instead of a newline, so that files
whose names contain newlines can be archived. GNU find is
one way to produce a list of null-terminated filenames. This
option may be used in copy-out and copy-pass modes.</p>

<p>-a, --reset-access-time Reset the access times of files
after reading them, so that it does not look like they have
just been read.</p>

<p>-A, --append Append to an existing archive. Only works
in copy-out mode. The archive must be a disk file specified
with the -O or -F (-file) option.</p>

<p>-b, --swap Swap both halfwords of words and bytes of
halfwords in the data. Equivalent to -sS. This option may be
used in copy-in mode. Use this option to convert 32-bit
integers between big-endian and lit- tle-endian
machines.</p>

<p>-B Set the I/O block size to 5120 bytes. Initially the
block size is 512 bytes.</p>

<p>--block-size=BLOCK-SIZE Set the I/O block size to
BLOCK-SIZE * 512 bytes.</p>

<p>-c Identical to -H newc, use the new (SVR4) portable
format. If you wish the old portable (ASCII) archive format,
use -H odc instead.</p>

<p>-C IO-SIZE, --io-size=IO-SIZE Set the I/O block size to
IO-SIZE bytes.</p>

<p>-d, --make-directories Create leading directories where
needed.</p>

<p>-E FILE, --pattern-file=FILE Read additional patterns
specifying filenames to extract or list from FILE. The lines
of FILE are treated as if they had been non-option arguments
to cpio. This option is used in copy-in mode,</p>

<p>-f, --nonmatching Only copy files that do not match any
of the given patterns.</p>

<p>-F, --file=archive Archive filename to use instead of
standard input or output. To use a tape drive on another
machine as the archive, use a filename that starts with
HOSTNAME:. The hostname can be preceded by a username and an
@ to access the remote tape drive as that user, if you have
permission to do so (typically an entry in that users
~/.rhosts file).</p>

<p>--force-local With -F, -I, or -O, take the archive file
name to be a local file even if it contains a colon, which
would ordinarily indicate a remote host name.</p>

<p>-H FORMAT, --format=FORMAT Use archive format FORMAT.
The valid for- mats are listed below; the same names are
also recognized in all-caps. The default in copy-in mode is
to automatically detect the archive for- mat, and in
copy-out mode is bin.</p>

<p>bin The obsolete binary format.</p>

<p>odc The old (POSIX.1) portable format.</p>

<p>newc The new (SVR4) portable format, which supports file
systems hav- ing more than 65536 i-nodes.</p>

<p>crc The new (SVR4) portable format with a checksum
added.</p>

<p>tar The old tar format.</p>

<p>ustar The POSIX.1 tar format. Also recognizes GNU tar
archives, which are similar but not identical.</p>

<p>hpbin The obsolete binary format used by HPUX s cpio
(which stores device files differently).</p>

<p>hpodc The portable format used by HPUXs cpio (which
stores device files differently).</p>

<p>-i, --extract Run in copy-in mode. see Copy-in mode.</p>

<p>-I archive Archive filename to use instead of standard
input. To use a tape drive on another machine as the
archive, use a filename that starts with HOSTNAME:. The
hostname can be preceded by a username and an @ to access
the remote tape drive as that user, if you have permission
to do so (typically an entry in that user s ~/.rhosts
file).</p>

<p>-k Ignored; for compatibility with other versions of
cpio.</p>

<p>-l, --link Link files instead of copying them, when
possible.</p>

<p>-L, --dereference Copy the file that a symbolic link
points to, rather than the symbolic link itself.</p>

<p>-m, --preserve-modification-time Retain previous file
modification times when creating files.</p>

<p>-M MESSAGE, --message=MESSAGE Print MESSAGE when the end
of a volume of the backup media (such as a tape or a floppy
disk) is reached, to prompt the user to insert a new volume.
If MESSAGE contains the string %d, it is replaced by the
current volume number (starting at 1).</p>

<p>-n, --numeric-uid-gid Show numeric UID and GID instead
of translating them into names when using the --verbose
option.</p>

<p>--absolute-filenames Do not strip leading file name
components that contain .. and leading slashes from file
names in copy-in mode</p>

<p>--no-preserve-owner Do not change the ownership of the
files; leave them owned by the user extracting them. This is
the default for non- root users, so that users on System V
dont inadvertantly give away files. This option can be used
in copy-in mode and copy-pass mode</p>

<p>-o, --create Run in copy-out mode. see Copy-out
mode.</p>

<p>-O archive Archive filename to use instead of standard
output. To use a tape drive on another machine as the
archive, use a filename that starts with HOSTNAME:. The
hostname can be preceded by a username and an @ to access
the remote tape drive as that user, if you have permission
to do so (typically an entry in that users ~/.rhosts
file).</p>

<p>--only-verify-crc Verify the CRC s of each file in the
archive, when reading a CRC format archive. Dont actually
extract the files.</p>

<p>-p, --pass-through Run in copy-pass mode. see Copy-pass
mode.</p>

<p>--quiet Do not print the number of blocks copied.</p>

<p>-r, --rename Interactively rename files.</p>

<p>-R [user][:.][group], --owner [user][:.][group] Set the
ownership of all files created to the specified user and/or
group in copy-out and copy-pass modes. Either the user, the
group, or both, must be present. If the group is omitted but
the : or . separator is given, use the given users login
group. Only the super-user can change files owner- ship.</p>

<p>--rsh-command=COMMAND Notifies cpio that is should use
COMMAND to communicate with remote devices.</p>

<p>-s, --swap-bytes Swap the bytes of each halfword (pair
of bytes) in the files.This option can be used in copy-in
mode.</p>

<p>-S, --swap-halfwords Swap the halfwords of each word (4
bytes) in the files. This option may be used in copy-in
mode.</p>

<p>--sparse Write files with large blocks of zeros as
sparse files. This option is used in copy-in and copy-pass
modes.</p>

<p>-t, --list Print a table of contents of the input.</p>

<p>-u, --unconditional Replace all files, without asking
whether to replace existing newer files with older
files.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose List the files processed, or with -t ,
give an ls -l style table of contents listing. In a verbose
table of contents of a ustar archive, user and group names
in the archive that do not exist on the local system are
replaced by the names that correspond locally to the numeric
UID and GID stored in the archive.</p>

<p>-V --dot Print a . for each file processed.</p>

<p>--version Print the cpio program version number and
exit.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES When creating an archive, cpio takes the list
of files to be processed from the standard input, and then
sends the archive to the standard output, or to the device
defined by the -F option. Usually find or ls is used to
provide this list to the standard input. In the follow- ing
example you can see the possibilities for archiving the
contents of a single directory.</p>

<p>% ls | cpio -ov &gt; directory.cpio</p>

<p>The -o option creates the archive, and the -v option
prints the names of the files archived as they are added.
Notice that the options can be put together after a single -
or can be placed separately on the command line. The &gt;
redirects the cpio output to the file directory.cpio.</p>

<p>If you wanted to archive an entire directory tree, the
find command can provide the file list to cpio:</p>

<p>% find . -print -depth | cpio -ov &gt; tree.cpio</p>

<p>This will take all the files in the current directory,
the directories below and place them in the archive
tree.cpio. Again the -o creates an archive, and the -v
option shows you the name of the files as they are archived.
see Copy-out mode. Using the . in the find statement will
give you more flexibility when doing restores, as it will
save file names with a relative path vice a hard wired,
absolute path. The -depth option forces find to print of the
entries in a directory before printing the directory itself.
This limits the effects of restrictive directory permissions
by printing the directory entries in a directory before the
directory name itself.</p>

<p>Extracting an archive requires a bit more thought
because cpio will not create directories by default. Another
characteristic, is it will not overwrite existing files
unless you tell it to.</p>

<p>% cpio -iv &lt; directory.cpio</p>

<p>This will retrieve the files archived in the file
directory.cpio and place them in the present directory. The
-i option extracts the archive and the -v shows the file
names as they are extracted. If you are dealing with an
archived directory tree, you need to use the -d option to
create directories as necessary, something like:</p>

<p>% cpio -idv &lt; tree.cpio</p>

<p>This will take the contents of the archive tree.cpio and
extract it to the current directory. If you try to extract
the files on top of files of the same name that already
exist (and have the same or later modifi- cation time) cpio
will not extract the file unless told to do so by the -u
option. see Copy-in mode.</p>

<p>In copy-pass mode, cpio copies files from one directory
tree to another, combining the copy-out and copy-in steps
without actually using an archive. It reads the list of
files to copy from the standard input; the directory into
which it will copy them is given as a non- option argument.
see Copy-pass mode.</p>

<p>% find . -depth -print0 | cpio --null -pvd new-dir</p>

<p>The example shows copying the files of the present
directory, and sub- directories to a new directory called
new-dir. Some new options are the -print0 available with GNU
find, combined with the --null option of cpio. These two
options act together to send file names between find and
cpio, even if special characters are embedded in the file
names. Another is -p, which tells cpio to pass the files it
finds to the directory new-dir.</p>

<p>BUGS The GNU folks, in general, abhor man pages, and
create info documents instead. The maintainer of cpio falls
into this category. Thus this man page may not be complete,
nor current, and was included in the Red Hat CVS tree
because man is a great tool :).</p>
