<p>TCDRAIN(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual TCDRAIN(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME tcdrain - wait for transmission of output</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;termios.h&gt;</p>

<p>int tcdrain(int fildes);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The tcdrain() function shall block until all
output written to the object referred to by fildes is
transmitted. The fildes argument is an open file descriptor
associated with a terminal.</p>

<p>Any attempts to use tcdrain() from a process which is a
member of a background process group on a fildes associated
with its controlling terminal, shall cause the process group
to be sent a SIGTTOU signal. If the calling process is
blocking or ignoring SIGTTOU signals, the pro- cess shall be
allowed to perform the operation, and no signal is sent.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, 0 shall be
returned. Otherwise, -1 shall be returned and errno set to
indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The tcdrain() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EBADF The fildes argument is not a valid file
descriptor.</p>

<p>EINTR A signal interrupted tcdrain().</p>

<p>ENOTTY The file associated with fildes is not a
terminal.</p>

<p>The tcdrain() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EIO The process group of the writing process is
orphaned, and the writing process is not ignoring or
blocking SIGTTOU.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>
