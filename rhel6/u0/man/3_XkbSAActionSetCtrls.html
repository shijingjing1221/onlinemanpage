<p>XkbSAActionSetCtrls(3) XKB FUNCTIONS
XkbSAActionSetCtrls(3)</p>

<p>NAME XkbSAActionSetCtrls - Sets the ctrls0 through
ctrls3 fields of act from ctrls</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS void XkbSAActionSetCtrls (XkbCtrlsAction act,
unsigned int ctrls);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS - act action in which to set ctrls0-ctrls3</p>

<p>- ctrls value to set in ctrls0-ctrls3</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Actions associated with the XkbCtrlsAction
structure change the state of the boolean controls.</p>

<p>The type field can have any one of the values shown in
Table 1.</p>

<p>Table 1 Controls Action Types
--------------------------------------------------------------
Type Effect
--------------------------------------------------------------
XkbSA_SetControls A key press enables any boolean controls
specified in the ctrls fields that were not already enabled
at the time of the key press. A key release disables any
controls enabled by the key press. This action can cause
XkbControlsNotify events. XkbSA_LockControls If the
XkbSA_LockNoLock bit is not set in the flags field, a key
press enables any controls specified in the ctrls fields
that were not already enabled at the time of the key press.
If the XkbSA_LockNoUnlock bit is not set in the flags field,
a key release dis- ables any controls specified in the ctrls
fields that were not already dis- abled at the time of the
key press. This action can cause XkbControlsNotify
events.</p>

<p>The flags field is composed of the bitwise inclusive OR
of the masks shown in Table 2.</p>

<p>Table 2 Control Action Flags
--------------------------------------------------------------
Flag Meaning
--------------------------------------------------------------
XkbSA_LockNoLock If set, and the action type is
XkbSA_LockControls, the server only dis- ables controls.
XkbSA_LockNoUnlock If set, and the action type is
XkbSA_LockControls, the server only enables controls.</p>

<p>The XkbSA_SetControls action implements a key that
enables a boolean control when pressed and disables it when
released. The XkbSA_LockCon- trols action is used to
implement a key that toggles the state of a boolean control
each time it is pressed and released. The XkbSA_Loc- kNoLock
and XkbSA_LockNoUnlock flags allow modifying the toggling
behavior to only unlock or only lock the boolean
control.</p>

<p>The ctrls0, ctrls1, ctrls2, and ctrls3 fields represent
the boolean controls in the enabled_ctrls field of the
controls structure. Xkb macros, to convert between the two
formats.</p>

<p>XkbSAActionSetCtrls sets the ctrls0 through ctrls3
fields of act from ctrls.</p>
