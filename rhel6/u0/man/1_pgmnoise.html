<p>NAME pgmnoise - create a PGM image made up of white
noise</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pgmnoise width height</p>

<p>[-randomseed=integer]</p>

<p>Minimum unique abbreviations of option are acceptable.
You may use double hyphens instead of single hyphen to
denote options. You may use white space in place of the
equals sign to separate an option name from its value.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pgmnoise creates a PGM image that is made up of pixels
of random brightness. The maxval is 255.</p>

<p>You specify the dimensions of the image with the width
and height argu- ments.</p>

<p>The randomness in the image is limited before Netpbm
10.37 (December 2006) -- if you run the program twice in the
same second, you may get identical output.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -randomseed=integer This is the seed for the
random number generator that generates the pixels.</p>

<p>Use this to ensure you get the same image on separate
invoca- tions.</p>

<p>By default, pgmnoise uses a seed derived from the time
of day and process ID, which gives you fairly uncorrelated
results in multiple invocations.</p>

<p>This option was new in Netpbm 10.45 (December 2008).</p>
