<p>NAME ipmiconsole - IPMI console utility</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ipmiconsole [OPTION...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION ipmiconsole is a Serial-over-LAN (SOL)
console utility. It can be used to establish console
sessions to remote machines using the IPMI 2.0 SOL
protocol.</p>

<p>IPMI 2.0 SOL Ipmiconsole communicates with a remote
machine s Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) to establish
a console session. Before any SOL commu- nication can take
place, the remote machines BMC must be configured properly.
Of primary importance, the IP address, MAC address, subnet,
usernames, passwords, privileges, SOL availability, SOL
privilege, and SOL user access must be configured and
enabled. The FreeIPMI tool bmc- config(1) may be used to do
this configuration. A BMC configuration tool may have also
been distributed with the machine.</p>

<p>Often (although not always), console redirection must be
also be con- figured properly in the BIOS and/or operating
system. Both must be con- figured to redirect console
traffic out the appropriate COM port.</p>

<p>GENERAL OPTIONS The following options are general
options for configuring IPMI communi- cation and executing
general tool commands.</p>

<p>-h, --hostname=IPMIHOST Specify the remote host to
communicate with.</p>

<p>-u, --username=USERNAME Specify the username to use when
authenticating with the remote host. If not specified, a
null (i.e. anonymous) username is assumed. The user must a
high enough privilege to establish a SOL session and have
SOL session abilities.</p>

<p>-p, --password=PASSWORD Specify the password to use when
authenticationg with the remote host. If not specified, a
null password is assumed. Maximum password length is 16 for
IPMI 1.5 and 20 for IPMI 2.0.</p>

<p>-P, --password-prompt Prompt for password to avoid
possibility of listing it in pro- cess lists.</p>

<p>-k, --k-g=K_G Specify the K_g BMC key to use when
authenticating with the remote host for IPMI 2.0. If not
specified, a null key is assumed. To input the key in
hexadecimal form, prefix the string with 0x . E.g., the key
abc can be entered with the either the string abc or the
string 0x616263</p>

<p>-K, --k-g-prompt Prompt for k-g to avoid possibility of
listing it in process lists.</p>

<p>--session-timeout=MILLISECONDS Specify the session
timeout in milliseconds. Defaults to 60000 milliseconds (60
seconds) if not specified.</p>

<p>--retransmission-timeout=MILLISECONDS Specify the packet
retransmission timeout in milliseconds. Defaults to 500
milliseconds (0.5 seconds) if not specified.</p>

<p>-I, --cipher-suite-id=CIPHER-SUITE-ID Specify the IPMI
2.0 cipher suite ID to use. The Cipher Suite ID identifies a
set of authentication, integrity, and confidential- ity
algorithms to use for IPMI 2.0 communication. The authenti-
cation algorithm identifies the algorithm to use for session
setup, the integrity algorithm identifies the algorithm to
use for session packet signatures, and the confidentiality
algorithm identifies the algorithm to use for payload
encryption. Defaults to cipher suite ID 3 if not specified.
The user should be aware that only cipher suite ids 3, 8,
and 12 encrypt console pay- loads. Console information will
be sent in the clear an alter- nate cipher suite id is
selected. The following cipher suite ids are currently
supported:</p>

<p>0 - Authentication Algorithm = None; Integrity Algorithm
= None; Confidentiality Algorithm = None</p>

<p>1 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-SHA1; Integrity
Algorithm = None; Confidentiality Algorithm = None</p>

<p>2 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-SHA1; Integrity
Algorithm = HMAC-SHA1-96; Confidentiality Algorithm =
None</p>

<p>3 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-SHA1; Integrity
Algorithm = HMAC-SHA1-96; Confidentiality Algorithm =
AES-CBC-128</p>

<p>6 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-MD5; Integrity
Algorithm = None; Confidentiality Algorithm = None</p>

<p>7 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-MD5; Integrity
Algorithm = HMAC-MD5-128; Confidentiality Algorithm =
None</p>

<p>8 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-MD5; Integrity
Algorithm = HMAC-MD5-128; Confidentiality Algorithm =
AES-CBC-128</p>

<p>11 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-MD5; Integrity
Algorithm = MD5-128; Confidentiality Algorithm = None</p>

<p>12 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-MD5; Integrity
Algorithm = MD5-128; Confidentiality Algorithm =
AES-CBC-128</p>

<p>-l, --privilege-level=PRIVILEGE-LEVEL Specify the
privilege level to be used. The currently available
privilege levels are USER, OPERATOR, and ADMIN. Defaults to
ADMIN if not specified.</p>

<p>--config-file=FILE Specify an alternate configuration
file.</p>

<p>-W, --workaround-flags=WORKAROUNDS Specify workarounds
to vendor compliance issues. Multiple workarounds can be
specified separated by commas. See WORKAROUNDS below for a
list of available workarounds.</p>

<p>--debug Turn on debugging.</p>

<p>-?, --help Output a help list and exit.</p>

<p>--usage Output a usage message and exit.</p>

<p>-V, --version Output the program version and exit.</p>

<p>IPMICONSOLE OPTIONS The following options are specific
to Ipmiconsole.</p>

<p>-e, --escape-char=CHAR Specify an alternate escape
character (default char &amp;).</p>

<p>-N, --dont-steal Do not steal an SOL session if one is
already detected as being in use. Under most circumstances,
if SOL is detected as being in use, ipmiconsole will attempt
to steal the SOL session away from the previous session.
This default behavior exists for several reasons, most
notably that earlier SOL sessions may have not been able to
be deactivate properly.</p>

<p>-T, --deactivate Deactivate a SOL session if one is
detected as being in use and exit.</p>

<p>-L, --lock-memory Lock sensitive information (such as
usernames and passwords) in memory.</p>

<p>ESCAPE CHARACTERS The following escape sequences are
supported. The default supported escape character is &amp;,
but can be changed with the -e option.</p>

<p>&amp;? Display a list of currently available escape
sequences.</p>

<p>&amp;. Terminate the connection.</p>

<p>&amp;B Send a &quot;serial-break&quot; to the remote
console.</p>

<p>&amp;D Send a DEL character.</p>

<p>&amp;&amp; Send a single escape character.</p>

<p>GENERAL TROUBLESHOOTING Most often, IPMI over LAN
problems involve a misconfiguration of the remote machine s
BMC. Double check to make sure the following are con-
figured properly in the remote machines BMC: IP address, MAC
address, subnet mask, username, user enablement, user
privilege, password, LAN privilege, LAN enablement, and
allowed authentication type(s). For IPMI 2.0 connections,
double check to make sure the cipher suite privi- lege(s)
and K_g key are configured properly. The bmc-config(8) tool
can be used to check and/or change these configuration
settings.</p>

<p>The following are common issues for given error
messages:</p>

<p>&quot;username invalid&quot; - The username entered (or
a NULL username if none was entered) is not available on the
remote machine. It may also be possible the remote BMC s
username configuration is incorrect.</p>

<p>&quot;password invalid&quot; - The password entered (or
a NULL password if none was entered) is not correct. It may
also be possible the password for the user is not correctly
configured on the remote BMC.</p>

<p>&quot;password verification timeout&quot; - Password
verification has timed out. A &quot;password invalid&quot;
error (described above) or a generic &quot;session
timeout&quot; (described below) occurred. During this point
in the protocol it cannot be differentiated which
occurred.</p>

<p>&quot;k_g invalid&quot; - The K_g key entered (or a NULL
K_g key if none was entered) is not correct. It may also be
possible the K_g key is not correctly configured on the
remote BMC.</p>

<p>&quot;privilege level insufficient&quot; - An IPMI
command requires a higher user privilege than the one
authenticated with. Please try to authenticate with a higher
privilege. This may require authenticating to a different
user which has a higher maximum privilege.</p>

<p>&quot;privilege level cannot be obtained for this
user&quot; - The privilege level you are attempting to
authenticate with is higher than the maxi- mum allowed for
this user. Please try again with a lower privilege. It may
also be possible the maximum privilege level allowed for a
user is not configured properly on the remote BMC.</p>

<p>&quot;authentication type unavailable for attempted
privilege level&quot; - The authentication type you wish to
authenticate with is not available for this privilege level.
Please try again with an alternate authentication type or
alternate privilege level. It may also be possible the
avail- able authentication types you can authenticate with
are not correctly configured on the remote BMC.</p>

<p>&quot;cipher suite id unavailable&quot; - The cipher
suite id you wish to authen- ticate with is not available on
the remote BMC. Please try again with an alternate cipher
suite id. It may also be possible the available cipher suite
ids are not correctly configured on the remote BMC.</p>

<p>&quot;ipmi 2.0 unavailable&quot; - IPMI 2.0 was not
discovered on the remote machine. Please try to use IPMI 1.5
instead.</p>

<p>&quot;connection timeout&quot; - Initial IPMI
communication failed. A number of potential errors are
possible, including an invalid hostname specified, an IPMI
IP address cannot be resolved, IPMI is not enabled on the
remote server, the network connection is bad, etc. Please
verify con- figuration and connectivity.</p>

<p>&quot;session timeout&quot; - The IPMI session has timed
out. Please reconnect.</p>

<p>If IPMI over LAN continually times out, you may wish to
increase the retransmission timeout. Some remote BMCs are
considerably slower than others.</p>

<p>Please see WORKAROUNDS below to also if there are any
vendor specific bugs that have been discovered and worked
around.</p>

<p>IPMICONSOLE TROUBLESHOOTING The following are common
issues for given error messages specifically for
ipmiconsole.</p>

<p>&quot;SOL unavailable&quot; - SOL is not configured for
use on the remote BMC. It may be not configured in general
or for the specific user specified. Authenticating with a
different user may be sufficient, however the IPMI protocol
does not reveal detail on what is not configured on the
remote BMC.</p>

<p>&quot;SOL in use&quot; - SOL is already in use on the
remote BMC. If you do not specify the --dont-steal option,
ipmiconsole will attempt to steal the SOL session away from
the other session.</p>

<p>&quot;SOL session stolen&quot; - Your SOL session has
been stolen by another ses- sion. You may wish to try and
steal the session back by reconnecting.</p>

<p>&quot;SOL requires encryption&quot; - SOL requires a
cipher suite id that includes encryption. Please try to use
cipher suite id 3, 8, or 12. It may also be possible the
encryption requirements are not configured correctly on the
remote BMC.</p>

<p>&quot;SOL requires no encryption&quot; - SOL requires a
cipher suite id that does not use encryption. Please try to
use cipher suite id 0, 1, 2, 6, 7, or 11. It may also be
possible the encryption requirements are not config- ured
correctly on the remote BMC.</p>

<p>&quot;BMC Implementation&quot; - The BMC on the remote
machine has a severe prob- lem in its implementation. Please
see the WORKAROUNDS section below for possible workarounds.
If additional vendor workarounds are required, please
contact the authors.</p>

<p>&quot;excess retransmissions sent&quot; - An excessive
number of retransmissions of SOL packets has occurred and
ipmiconsole has given up. This may be due to network issues
or SOL issues. Some of the same issues involved with
&quot;connection timeout&quot; or &quot;session
timeout&quot; errors may be involved. Please try to
reconnect.</p>

<p>&quot;excess errors received&quot; - An excessive number
of SOL packet errors has occurred and ipmiconsole has given
up. This may be due to network issues or SOL issues. Please
try to reconnect.</p>

<p>&quot;BMC Error&quot; - This error usually means a
vendor SOL implementation requires a combination of
authentication, encryption, privilege, etc. that have not
been met by the users choices. Please try a combination of
different cipher suites, privileges, etc. to resolve the
problem.</p>

<p>WORKAROUNDS With so many different vendors implementing
their own IPMI solutions, different vendors may implement
their IPMI protocols incorrectly. The following lists the
handful of compliance issues discovered and the workarounds
currently supported.</p>

<p>When possible, workarounds have been implemented so they
will be trans- parent to the user. However, some will
require the user to specify a workaround be used via the -W
option.</p>

<p>The hardware listed below may only indicate the hardware
that a problem was discovered on. Newer versions of hardware
may fix the problems indicated below. Similar machines from
vendors may or may not exhibit the same problems.</p>

<p>Asus P5M2/P5MT-R/RS162-E4/RX4: The motherboard does not
properly report username capabilities and/or K_g status.
This will likely cause &quot;user- name invalid&quot; or
&quot;k_g invalid&quot; errors to occur. In order to work
around this issue, the &quot;authcap&quot; workaround must
be specified.</p>

<p>Intel SR1520ML/X38ML: The motherboard does not properly
report username capabilities and/or K_g status. This will
likely cause &quot;username invalid&quot; or &quot;k_g
invalid&quot; errors to occur. In order to work around this
issue, the &quot;authcap&quot; workaround must be
specified.</p>

<p>Intel SE7520AF2 with Intel Server Management Module
(Professional Edi- tion): There are a number of Intel IPMI
2.0 authentcation and SOL con- nection bugs. These problems
may cause &quot;username invalid&quot;, &quot;password
invalid&quot;, &quot;k_g invalid&quot;, or &quot;BMC
Error&quot; errors to occur. They can be worked around by
specifying the &quot;intel20&quot; workaround. The
workarounds include padding of usernames, automatic
acceptance of a RAKP 4 response integrity check when using
the integrity algorithm MD5-128, password truncation if the
authentication algorithm is HMAC-MD5-128, and speci- fying
Intel IPMI 2.0 specific SOL connection parameters.</p>

<p>Supermicro H8QME with SIMSO daughter card: There are
several Supermicro IPMI 2.0 bugs on early firmware revisions
which can be worked around using the
&quot;supermicro20&quot; workaround. These problems may
cause &quot;password invalid&quot; errors to occur. These
compliance bugs are confirmed to be fixed on newer
firmware.</p>

<p>Sun Fire 4100/4200/4500 with ILOM: There are several Sun
IPMI 2.0 bugs. These problems may cause &quot;password
invalid&quot; or &quot;bmc error&quot; errors to occur. They
can be worked around by specifying the &quot;sun20&quot;
workaround. The workarounds include handling invalid
lengthed hash keys, improperly hashed keys, and invalid
cipher suite records.</p>

<p>Inventec 5441, Supermicro X8DTH: The privilege level
sent during the Open Session stage of an IPMI 2.0 connection
is used for hashing keys instead of the privilege level sent
during the RAKP1 connection stage. This may cause
&quot;password invalid&quot; or &quot;BMC Error&quot; errors
to occur. It can be worked around by specifying the
&quot;opensesspriv&quot; workaround.</p>

<p>Asus P5M2/RS162-E4/RX4, Intel SR1520ML/X38ML, Inventec
5441, Sun x4100, Supermicro X8DTH: Incorrect IPMI 2.0 SOL
payload sizes are reported by motherboard SOL packet
responses. This will likely cause &quot;BMC Implemen-
tation&quot; errors to occur. In order to work around this
issue, the &quot;sol- payloadsize&quot; workaround must be
specified.</p>

<p>Asus P5MT-R, Supermicro X8DTH-iF: An invalid IPMI 2.0
SOL port is reported by the motherboard. This may cause
&quot;connection timeout&quot; errors to occur. In order to
work around this issue, the &quot;solport&quot; workaround
must be specified.</p>

<p>Supermicro X8SIL-F: The Get Payload Activation Status
command isnt supported. This may cause &quot;BMC Error&quot;
errors to occur. In order to work around this issue, the
&quot;solstatus&quot; workaround must be specified.</p>

<p>SPECIFIC HARDWARE NOTES Intel SR1520ML/X38ML: After a
reboot, the SOL session appears to &quot;dis- connect&quot;
from the motherboard but stay alive. Character data input
from the ipmiconsole client is accepted by the remote
machine, but no character data or console data is ever sent
back from the remote machine. The SOL session is
subsequently useless. There is currently no workaround in
place to handle this. The session must be closed and
restarted.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES # ipmiconsole -h ahost -u myusername -p
mypassword</p>

<p>Establish a console sesssion with a remote host.</p>

<p>KNOWN ISSUES On older operating systems, if you input
your username, password, and other potentially security
relevant information on the command line, this information
may be discovered by other users when using tools like the
ps(1) command or looking in the /proc file system. It is
generally more secure to input password information with
options like the -P or -K options. Configuring security
relevant information in the FreeIPMI configuration file
would also be an appropriate way to hide this infor-
mation.</p>

<p>In order to prevent brute force attacks, some BMCs will
temporarily &quot;lock up&quot; after a number of remote
authentication errors. You may need to wait awhile in order
to this temporary &quot;lock up&quot; to pass before you may
authenticate again.</p>
