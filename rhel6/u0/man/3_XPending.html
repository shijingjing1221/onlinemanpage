<p>XFlush(3) XLIB FUNCTIONS XFlush(3)</p>

<p>NAME XFlush, XSync, XEventsQueued, XPending - handle
output buffer or event queue</p>

<p>SYNTAX int XFlush(Display *display);</p>

<p>int XSync(Display *display, Bool discard);</p>

<p>int XEventsQueued(Display *display, int mode);</p>

<p>int XPending(Display *display);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS discard Specifies a Boolean value that
indicates whether XSync dis- cards all events on the event
queue.</p>

<p>display Specifies the connection to the X server.</p>

<p>mode Specifies the mode. You can pass QueuedAlready,
QueuedAfter- Flush, or QueuedAfterReading.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The XFlush function flushes the output
buffer. Most client applica- tions need not use this
function because the output buffer is automati- cally
flushed as needed by calls to XPending, XNextEvent, and
XWindow- Event. Events generated by the server may be
enqueued into the librarys event queue.</p>

<p>The XSync function flushes the output buffer and then
waits until all requests have been received and processed by
the X server. Any errors generated must be handled by the
error handler. For each protocol error received by Xlib,
XSync calls the client application s error han- dling
routine (see section 11.8.2). Any events generated by the
server are enqueued into the librarys event queue.</p>

<p>Finally, if you passed False, XSync does not discard the
events in the queue. If you passed True, XSync discards all
events in the queue, including those events that were on the
queue before XSync was called. Client applications seldom
need to call XSync.</p>

<p>If mode is QueuedAlready, XEventsQueued returns the
number of events already in the event queue (and never
performs a system call). If mode is QueuedAfterFlush,
XEventsQueued returns the number of events already in the
queue if the number is nonzero. If there are no events in
the queue, XEventsQueued flushes the output buffer, attempts
to read more events out of the applications connection, and
returns the number read. If mode is QueuedAfterReading,
XEventsQueued returns the number of events already in the
queue if the number is nonzero. If there are no events in
the queue, XEventsQueued attempts to read more events out of
the applications connection without flushing the output
buffer and returns the number read.</p>

<p>XEventsQueued always returns immediately without I/O if
there are events already in the queue. XEventsQueued with
mode QueuedAfterFlush is identical in behavior to XPending.
XEventsQueued with mode QueuedAlready is identical to the
XQLength function.</p>

<p>The XPending function returns the number of events that
have been received from the X server but have not been
removed from the event queue. XPending is identical to
XEventsQueued with the mode QueuedAfterFlush specified.</p>
