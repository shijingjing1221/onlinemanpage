<p>GETIFADDRS(3) Linux Programmer s Manual
GETIFADDRS(3)</p>

<p>NAME getifaddrs, freeifaddrs - get interface
addresses</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; #include
&lt;ifaddrs.h&gt;</p>

<p>int getifaddrs(struct ifaddrs **ifap);</p>

<p>void freeifaddrs(struct ifaddrs *ifa);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The getifaddrs() function creates a linked
list of structures describ- ing the network interfaces of
the local system, and stores the address of the first item
of the list in *ifap. The list consists of ifaddrs
structures, defined as follows:</p>

<p>struct ifaddrs { struct ifaddrs *ifa_next; /* Next item
in list */ char *ifa_name; /* Name of interface */ unsigned
int ifa_flags; /* Flags from SIOCGIFFLAGS */ struct sockaddr
*ifa_addr; /* Address of interface */ struct sockaddr
*ifa_netmask; /* Netmask of interface */ union { struct
sockaddr *ifu_broadaddr; /* Broadcast address of interface
*/ struct sockaddr *ifu_dstaddr; /* Point-to-point
destination address */ } ifa_ifu; #define ifa_broadaddr
ifa_ifu.ifu_broadaddr #define ifa_dstaddr
ifa_ifu.ifu_dstaddr void *ifa_data; /* Address-specific data
*/ };</p>

<p>The ifa_next field contains a pointer to the next
structure on the list, or NULL if this is the last item of
the list.</p>

<p>The ifa_name points to the null-terminated interface
name.</p>

<p>The ifa_flags field contains the interface flags, as
returned by the SIOCGIFFLAGS ioctl(2) operation (see
netdevice(7) for a list of these flags).</p>

<p>The ifa_addr field points to a structure containing the
interface address. (The sa_family sub-field should be
consulted to determine the format of the address
structure.)</p>

<p>The ifa_netmask field points to a structure containing
the netmask associated with ifa_addr, if applicable for the
address family.</p>

<p>Depending on whether the bit IFF_BROADCAST or
IFF_POINTOPOINT is set in ifa_flags (only one can be set at
a time), either ifa_broadaddr will contain the broadcast
address associated with ifa_addr (if applicable for the
address family) or ifa_dstaddr will contain the destination
address of the point-to-point interface.</p>

<p>The ifa_data field points to a buffer containing
address-family-spe- cific data; this field may be NULL if
there is no such data for this interface.</p>

<p>The data returned by getifaddrs() is dynamically
allocated and should be freed using freeifaddrs() when no
longer needed.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUES On success, getifaddrs() returns zero; on
error, -1 is returned, and errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS getifaddrs() may fail and set errno for any of
the errors specified for socket(2), bind(2), getsockname(2),
recvmsg(2), sendto(2), malloc(3), or realloc(3).</p>

<p>VERSIONS The getifaddrs() function first appeared in
glibc 2.3, but before glibc 2.3.3, the implementation only
supported IPv4 addresses; IPv6 support was added in glibc
2.3.3. Support of address families other than IPv4 is only
available on kernels that support netlink.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO Not in POSIX.1-2001. This function first
appeared in BSDi and is present on the BSD systems, but with
slightly different semantics docu- mentedreturning one entry
per interface, not per address. This means ifa_addr and
other fields can actually be NULL if the interface has no
address, and no link-level address is returned if the
interface has an IP address assigned. Also, the way of
choosing either ifa_broadaddr or ifa_dstaddr differs on
various systems.</p>

<p>NOTES The addresses returned on Linux will usually be
the IPv4 and IPv6 addresses assigned to the interface, but
also one AF_PACKET address per interface containing
lower-level details about the interface and its physical
layer. In this case, the ifa_data field may contain a
pointer to a struct net_device_stats, defined in
&lt;linux/netdevice.h&gt;, which contains various interface
attributes and statistics.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE The program below demonstrates the use of
getifaddrs(), freeifaddrs(), and getnameinfo(3). Here is
what we see when running this program on one system:</p>

<p>$ ./a.out lo address family: 17 (AF_PACKET) eth0 address
family: 17 (AF_PACKET) lo address family: 2 (AF_INET)
address: &lt;127.0.0.1&gt; eth0 address family: 2 (AF_INET)
address: &lt;10.1.1.4&gt; lo address family: 10 (AF_INET6)
address: &lt;::1&gt; eth0 address family: 10 (AF_INET6)
address: &lt;fe80::2d0:59ff:feda:eb51%eth0&gt;</p>

<p>for (ifa = ifaddr; ifa != NULL; ifa = ifa-&gt;ifa_next)
{ family = ifa-&gt;ifa_addr-&gt;sa_family;</p>

<p>/* Display interface name and family (including symbolic
form of the latter for the common families) */</p>

<p>printf(&quot;%s address family: %d%s0, ifa-&gt;ifa_name,
family, (family == AF_PACKET) ? &quot; (AF_PACKET)&quot; :
(family == AF_INET) ? &quot; (AF_INET)&quot; : (family ==
AF_INET6) ? &quot; (AF_INET6)&quot; : &quot;&quot;);</p>

<p>/* For an AF_INET* interface address, display the
address */</p>

<p>if (family == AF_INET || family == AF_INET6) { s =
getnameinfo(ifa-&gt;ifa_addr, (family == AF_INET) ?
sizeof(struct sockaddr_in) : sizeof(struct sockaddr_in6),
