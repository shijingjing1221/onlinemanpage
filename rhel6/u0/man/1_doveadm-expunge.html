<p>DOVEADM-EXPUNGE(1) Dovecot DOVEADM-EXPUNGE(1)</p>

<p>NAME doveadm-expunge - Expunge messages matching given
search query</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS doveadm [-Dv] expunge search_query doveadm
[-Dv] expunge -A search_query doveadm [-Dv] expunge -u user
search_query</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This command can be used to expunge mails
matching the given search query. It is typically used to
expunge old mails from users&rsquo; Trash and/or Spam
mailboxes. To test which messages a given search query would
match, you can use doveadm fetch or doveadm search
commands.</p>

<p>In the first form, doveadm(1) will executed the expunge
action with the environment of the logged in system
user.</p>

<p>In the second form, the command will be performed for
all users.</p>

<p>In the third form, only matching mails of the given
user(s) will be expunged.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Global doveadm(1) options:</p>

<p>-D Enables verbosity and debug messages.</p>

<p>-v Enables verbosity, including progress counter.</p>

<p>Command specific options:</p>

<p>-A If the -A option is present, the command will be
performed for all users. Using this option in combination
with system users from userdb { driver = passwd } is not
recommended, because it contains also users with a lower UID
than the one configured with the first_valid_uid
setting.</p>

<p>When the sql userdb module is used make sure that the
iter- ate_query setting in the
/etc/dovecot/dovecot-sql.conf.ext matches your database
layout. Otherwise doveadm(1) will be unable to iterate over
all users.</p>

<p>-u user/mask Run the command only for the given user.
It&rsquo;s also possible to use &rsquo;*&rsquo; and
&rsquo;?&rsquo; wildcards (e.g. -u *@example.org). When
neither the -A option nor -u user was specified, the com-
mand will be executed with the environment of the currently
logged in user.</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS search_query Expunge messages matching this
search query. See doveadm-search-query(7) for details.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE This example expunges messages from Spam mailbox
that were saved/copied there more than two weeks ago:</p>

<p>doveadm expunge -u jane.doe@example.org mailbox Spam
savedbefore 2w</p>
