<p>SDL_PumpEvents(3) SDL API Reference
SDL_PumpEvents(3)</p>

<p>NAME SDL_PumpEvents - Pumps the event loop, gathering
events from the input devices.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &quot;SDL.h&quot;</p>

<p>void SDL_PumpEvents(void);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Pumps the event loop, gathering events from
the input devices.</p>

<p>SDL_PumpEvents gathers all the pending input information
from devices and places it on the event queue. Without calls
to SDL_PumpEvents no events would ever be placed on the
queue. Often calls the need for SDL_PumpEvents is hidden
from the user since SDL_PollEvent and SDL_WaitEvent
implicitly call SDL_PumpEvents. However, if you are not
polling or waiting for events (e.g. your filtering them),
then you must call SDL_PumpEvents to force an event queue
update.</p>

<p>Note:</p>

<p>You can only call this function in the thread that set
the video mode.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO SDL_PollEvent</p>
