<p>XMODMAP(1) XMODMAP(1)</p>

<p>NAME xmodmap - utility for modifying keymaps and pointer
button mappings in X</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS xmodmap [-options ...] [filename]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The xmodmap program is used to edit and
display the keyboard modifier map and keymap table that are
used by client applications to convert event keycodes into
keysyms. It is usually run from the users session startup
script to configure the keyboard according to personal
tastes.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The following options may be used with
xmodmap:</p>

<p>-display display This option specifies the host and
display to use.</p>

<p>-help This option indicates that a brief description of
the command line arguments should be printed on the standard
error channel. This will be done whenever an unhandled
argument is given to xmodmap.</p>

<p>-grammar This option indicates that a help message
describing the expression grammar used in files and with -e
expressions should be printed on the standard error.</p>

<p>-verbose This option indicates that xmodmap should print
logging infor- mation as it parses its input.</p>

<p>-quiet This option turns off the verbose logging. This
is the default.</p>

<p>-n This option indicates that xmodmap should not change
the map- pings, but should display what it would do, like
make(1) does when given this option.</p>

<p>-e expression This option specifies an expression to be
executed. Any number of expressions may be specified from
the command line.</p>

<p>-pm This option indicates that the current modifier map
should be printed on the standard output. This is the
default mode of operation if no other mode options are
specified.</p>

<p>-pk This option indicates that the current keymap table
should be printed on the standard output.</p>

<p>-pke This option indicates that the current keymap table
should be printed on the standard output in the form of
expressions that can be fed back to xmodmap.</p>

<p>-pp This option indicates that the current pointer map
should be printed on the standard output.</p>

<p>- A lone dash means that the standard input should be
used as the input file.</p>

<p>The filename specifies a file containing xmodmap
expressions to be executed. This file is usually kept in the
user s home directory with a name like .xmodmaprc.</p>

<p>EXPRESSION GRAMMAR The xmodmap program reads a list of
expressions and parses them all before attempting to execute
any of them. This makes it possible to refer to keysyms that
are being redefined in a natural way without hav- ing to
worry as much about name conflicts.</p>

<p>keycode NUMBER = KEYSYMNAME ... The list of keysyms is
assigned to the indicated keycode (which may be specified in
decimal, hex or octal and can be determined by running the
xev program). Up to eight keysyms may be attached to a key,
however the last four are not used in any major X server
implementation. The first keysym is used when no modifier
key is pressed in conjunction with this key, the second with
Shift, the third when the Mode_switch key is used with this
key and the fourth when both the Mode_switch and Shift keys
are used.</p>

<p>keycode any = KEYSYMNAME ... If no existing key has the
specified list of keysyms assigned to it, a spare key on the
keyboard is selected and the keysyms are assigned to it. The
list of keysyms may be specified in decimal, hex or
octal.</p>

<p>keysym KEYSYMNAME = KEYSYMNAME ... The KEYSYMNAME on the
left hand side is translated into match- ing keycodes used
to perform the corresponding set of keycode expressions. The
list of keysym names may be found in the header file
&lt;X11/keysymdef.h&gt; (without the XK_ prefix) or the
keysym database /usr/share/X11 /XKeysymDB. Note that if the
same keysym is bound to multiple keys, the expression is
exe- cuted for each matching keycode.</p>

<p>clear MODIFIERNAME This removes all entries in the
modifier map for the given mod- ifier, where valid name are:
Shift, Lock, Control, Mod1, Mod2, Mod3, Mod4, and Mod5 (case
does not matter in modifier names, although it does matter
for all other names). For example, clear Lock will remove
all any keys that were bound to the shift lock modifier.</p>

<p>add MODIFIERNAME = KEYSYMNAME ... This adds all keys
containing the given keysyms to the indi- cated modifier
map. The keysym names are evaluated after all input
expressions are read to make it easy to write expressions to
swap keys (see the EXAMPLES section).</p>

<p>remove MODIFIERNAME = KEYSYMNAME ... This removes all
keys containing the given keysyms from the indicated
modifier map. Unlike add, the keysym names are eval- uated
as the line is read in. This allows you to remove keys from
a modifier without having to worry about whether or not they
have been reassigned.</p>

<p>pointer = default This sets the pointer map back to its
default settings (button 1 generates a code of 1, button 2
generates a 2, etc.).</p>

<p>pointer = NUMBER ... This sets the pointer map to
contain the indicated button codes. The list always starts
with the first physical button.</p>

<p>Lines that begin with an exclamation point (!) are taken
as comments.</p>

<p>If you want to change the binding of a modifier key, you
must also remove it from the appropriate modifier map.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Many pointers are designed such that the first
button is pressed using the index finger of the right hand.
People who are left-handed fre- quently find that it is more
comfortable to reverse the button codes that get generated
so that the primary button is pressed using the index finger
of the left hand. This could be done on a 3 button pointer
as follows:</p>

<p>% xmodmap -e &quot;pointer = 3 2 1&quot;</p>

<p>Many applications support the notion of Meta keys
(similar to Control keys except that Meta is held down
instead of Control). However, some servers do not have a
Meta keysym in the default keymap table, so one needs to be
added by hand. The following command will attach Meta to the
Multi-language key (sometimes labeled Compose Character). It
also takes advantage of the fact that applications that need
a Meta key sim- ply need to get the keycode and dont require
the keysym to be in the first column of the keymap table.
This means that applications that are looking for a
Multi_key (including the default modifier map) wont notice
any change.</p>

<p>% xmodmap -e &quot;keysym Multi_key = Multi_key
Meta_L&quot;</p>

<p>Similarly, some keyboards have an Alt key but no Meta
key. In that case the following may be useful:</p>

<p>% xmodmap -e &quot;keysym Alt_L = Meta_L Alt_L&quot;</p>

<p>One of the more simple, yet convenient, uses of xmodmap
is to set the keyboard s &quot;rubout&quot; key to generate
an alternate keysym. This fre- quently involves exchanging
Backspace with Delete to be more comfort- able to the user.
If the ttyModes resource in xterm is set as well, all
terminal emulator windows will use the same key for erasing
charac- ters:</p>

<p>% xmodmap -e &quot;keysym BackSpace = Delete&quot; %
echo &quot;XTerm*ttyModes: erase ^?&quot; | xrdb -merge</p>

<p>Some keyboards do not automatically generate less than
and greater than characters when the comma and period keys
are shifted. This can be remedied with xmodmap by resetting
the bindings for the comma and period with the following
scripts:</p>

<p>! ! make shift-, be &lt; and shift-. be &gt; ! keysym
comma = comma less keysym period = period greater</p>

<p>One of the more irritating differences between keyboards
is the loca- tion of the Control and Shift Lock keys. A
common use of xmodmap is to swap these two keys as
follows:</p>

<p>! ! Swap Caps_Lock and Control_L ! remove Lock =
Caps_Lock remove Control = Control_L keysym Control_L =
Caps_Lock keysym Caps_Lock = Control_L add Lock = Caps_Lock
add Control = Control_L</p>

<p>This example can be run again to swap the keys back to
their previous assignments.</p>

<p>The keycode command is useful for assigning the same
keysym to multiple keycodes. Although unportable, it also
makes it possible to write scripts that can reset the
keyboard to a known state. The following script sets the
backspace key to generate Delete (as shown above), flushes
all existing caps lock bindings, makes the CapsLock key be a
control key, make F5 generate Escape, and makes Break/Reset
be a shift lock.</p>

<p>! ! On the HP, the following keycodes have key caps as
listed: ! ! 101 Backspace ! 55 Caps ! 14 Ctrl ! 15
Break/Reset ! 86 Stop ! 89 F5 ! keycode 101 = Delete keycode
55 = Control_R clear Lock add Control = Control_R keycode 89
= Escape keycode 15 = Caps_Lock add Lock = Caps_Lock</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT DISPLAY to get default host and display
number.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO X(7), xev(1), Xlib documentation on key and
pointer events</p>

<p>BUGS Every time a keycode expression is evaluated, the
server generates a MappingNotify event on every client. This
can cause some thrashing. All of the changes should be
batched together and done at once. Clients that receive
keyboard input and ignore MappingNotify events will not
notice any changes made to keyboard mappings.</p>

<p>Xmodmap should generate &quot;add&quot; and
&quot;remove&quot; expressions automatically whenever a
keycode that is already bound to a modifier is changed.</p>

<p>There should be a way to have the remove expression
accept keycodes as well as keysyms for those times when you
really mess up your mappings.</p>
