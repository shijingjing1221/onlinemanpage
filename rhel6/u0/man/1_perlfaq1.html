<p>PERLFAQ1(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERLFAQ1(1)</p>

<p>NAME perlfaq1 - General Questions About Perl</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This section of the FAQ answers very
general, high-level questions about Perl.</p>

<p>What is Perl? Perl is a high-level programming language
with an eclectic heritage written by Larry Wall and a cast
of thousands. It derives from the ubiquitous C programming
language and to a lesser extent from sed, awk, the Unix
shell, and at least a dozen other tools and languages. Perls
process, file, and text manipulation facilities make it
particularly well-suited for tasks involving quick
prototyping, system utilities, software tools, system
management tasks, database access, graphical programming,
networking, and world wide web programming. These strengths
make it especially popular with system administrators and
CGI script authors, but mathematicians, geneticists,
journalists, and even managers also use Perl. Maybe you
should, too.</p>

<p>Who supports Perl? Who develops it? Why is it free? The
original culture of the pre-populist Internet and the
deeply-held beliefs of Perls author, Larry Wall, gave rise
to the free and open distribution policy of perl. Perl is
supported by its users. The core, the standard Perl library,
the optional modules, and the documentation you re reading
now were all written by volunteers. See the personal note at
the end of the README file in the perl source distribution
for more details. See perlhist (new as of 5.005) for Perls
milestone releases.</p>

<p>In particular, the core development team (known as the
Perl Porters) are a rag-tag band of highly altruistic
individuals committed to producing better software for free
than you could hope to purchase for money. You may snoop on
pending developments via the archives at
http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/ and
http://archive.develooper.com/perl5-porters@perl.org/ or the
news gateway nntp://nntp.perl.org/perl.perl5.porters or its
web interface at
http://nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters , or read the
faq at http://dev.perl.org/perl5/docs/p5p-faq.html , or you
can subscribe to the mailing list by sending
perl5-porters-request@perl.org a subscription request (an
empty message with no subject is fine).</p>

<p>While the GNU project includes Perl in its
distributions, theres no such thing as &quot;GNU Perl&quot;.
Perl is not produced nor maintained by the Free Software
Foundation. Perls licensing terms are also more open than
GNU softwares tend to be.</p>

<p>You can get commercial support of Perl if you wish,
although for most users the informal support will more than
suffice. See the answer to &quot;Where can I buy a
commercial version of perl?&quot; for more information.</p>

<p>Which version of Perl should I use? (contributed by
brian d foy)</p>

<p>There is often a matter of opinion and taste, and there
isnt any one answer that fits everyone. In general, you want
to use either the current stable release, or the stable
release immediately prior to that one. Currently, those are
perl5.10.x and perl5.8.x, respectively.</p>

<p>Beyond that, you have to consider several things and
decide which is best for you.</p>

<p>&middot; If things arent broken, upgrading perl may
break them (or at least issue new warnings).</p>

<p>&middot; The latest versions of perl have more bug
fixes.</p>

<p>&middot; The Perl community is geared toward supporting
the most recent releases, so youll have an easier time
finding help for those.</p>

<p>&middot; Versions prior to perl5.004 had serious
security problems with buffer overflows, and in some cases
have CERT advisories (for instance,
http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-1997-17.html ).</p>

<p>&middot; The latest versions are probably the least
deployed and widely tested, so you may want to wait a few
months after their release and see what problems others have
if you are risk averse.</p>

<p>&middot; The immediate, previous releases (i.e.
perl5.8.x ) are usually maintained for a while, although not
at the same level as the current releases.</p>

<p>&middot; No one is actively supporting Perl 4. Five
years ago it was a dead camel carcass (according to this
document). Now it s barely a skeleton as its whitewashed
bones have fractured or eroded.</p>

<p>&middot; There is no Perl 6 release scheduled, but it
will be available when its ready. Stay tuned, but dont worry
that youll have to change major versions of Perl; no one is
going to take Perl 5 away from you.</p>

<p>&middot; There are really two tracks of perl
development: a maintenance version and an experimental
version. The maintenance versions are stable, and have an
even number as the minor release (i.e. perl5.10.x, where 10
is the minor release). The experimental versions may include
features that dont make it into the stable versions, and
have an odd number as the minor release (i.e. perl5.9.x,
where 9 is the minor release).</p>

<p>What are Perl 4, Perl 5, or Perl 6? (contributed by
brian d foy)</p>

<p>In short, Perl 4 is the past, Perl 5 is the present, and
Perl 6 is the future.</p>

<p>The number after perl (i.e. the 5 after Perl 5) is the
major release of the perl interpreter as well as the version
of the language. Each major version has significant
differences that earlier versions cannot support.</p>

<p>The current major release of Perl is Perl 5, and was
released in 1994. It can run scripts from the previous major
release, Perl 4 (March 1991), but has significant
differences. It introduced the concept of references,
complex data structures, and modules. The Perl 5 interpreter
was a complete re-write of the previous perl sources.</p>

<p>Perl 6 is the next major version of Perl, but its still
in development in both its syntax and design. The work
started in 2002 and is still ongoing. Many of the most
interesting features have shown up in the latest versions of
Perl 5, and some Perl 5 modules allow you to use some Perl 6
syntax in your programs. You can learn more about Perl 6 at
http://dev.perl.org/perl6/ .</p>

<p>See perlhist for a history of Perl revisions.</p>

<p>What was Ponie? (contributed by brian d foy)</p>

<p>Ponie stands for &quot;Perl On the New Internal
Engine&quot;, started by Arthur Bergman from Fotango in
2003, and subsequently run as a project of The Perl
Foundation. It was abandoned in 2006 (
http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.ponie.dev/487 ).</p>

<p>Instead of using the current Perl internals, Ponie aimed
to create a new one that would provide a translation path
from Perl 5 to Perl 6 (or anything else that targets Parrot,
actually). You would have been able to just keep using Perl
5 with Parrot, the virtual machine which will compile and
run Perl 6 bytecode.</p>

<p>What is Perl 6? At The Second O Reilly Open Source
Software Convention, Larry Wall announced Perl 6 development
would begin in earnest. Perl 6 was an oft used term for Chip
Salzenbergs project to rewrite Perl in C++ named Topaz.
However, Topaz provided valuable insights to the next
version of Perl and its implementation, but was ultimately
abandoned.</p>

<p>If you want to learn more about Perl 6, or have a desire
to help in the crusade to make Perl a better place then
peruse the Perl 6 developers page at
http://dev.perl.org/perl6/ and get involved.</p>

<p>Perl 6 is not scheduled for release yet, and Perl 5 will
still be supported for quite awhile after its release. Do
not wait for Perl 6 to do whatever you need to do.</p>

<p>&quot;Were really serious about reinventing everything
that needs reinventing.&quot; --Larry Wall</p>

<p>How stable is Perl? Production releases, which
incorporate bug fixes and new functionality, are widely
tested before release. Since the 5.000 release, we have
averaged only about one production release per year.</p>

<p>Larry and the Perl development team occasionally make
changes to the internal core of the language, but all
possible efforts are made toward backward compatibility.
While not quite all Perl 4 scripts run flawlessly under Perl
5, an update to perl should nearly never invalidate a
program written for an earlier version of perl (barring
accidental bug fixes and the rare new keyword).</p>

<p>Is Perl difficult to learn? No, Perl is easy to start
learning--and easy to keep learning. It looks like most
programming languages youre likely to have experience with,
so if youve ever written a C program, an awk script, a shell
script, or even a BASIC program, youre already partway
there.</p>

<p>Most tasks only require a small subset of the Perl
language. One of the guiding mottos for Perl development is
&quot;theres more than one way to do it&quot; (TMTOWTDI,
sometimes pronounced &quot;tim toady&quot;). Perls learning
curve is therefore shallow (easy to learn) and long (theres
a whole lot you can do if you really want).</p>

<p>Finally, because Perl is frequently (but not always, and
certainly not by definition) an interpreted language, you
can write your programs and test them without an
intermediate compilation step, allowing you to experiment
and test/debug quickly and easily. This ease of
experimentation flattens the learning curve even more.</p>

<p>Things that make Perl easier to learn: Unix experience,
almost any kind of programming experience, an understanding
of regular expressions, and the ability to understand other
peoples code. If there s something you need to do, then its
probably already been done, and a working example is usually
available for free. Dont forget Perl modules, either. They
re discussed in Part 3 of this FAQ, along with CPAN, which
is discussed in Part 2.</p>

<p>How does Perl compare with other languages like Java,
Python, REXX, Scheme, or Tcl? Favorably in some areas,
unfavorably in others. Precisely which areas are good and
bad is often a personal choice, so asking this question on
Usenet runs a strong risk of starting an unproductive Holy
War.</p>

<p>Probably the best thing to do is try to write equivalent
code to do a set of tasks. These languages have their own
newsgroups in which you can learn about (but hopefully not
argue about) them.</p>

<p>Some comparison documents can be found at
http://www.perl.com/doc/FMTEYEWTK/versus/ if you really cant
stop yourself.</p>

<p>Can I do [task] in Perl? Perl is flexible and extensible
enough for you to use on virtually any task, from one-line
file-processing tasks to large, elaborate systems. For many
people, Perl serves as a great replacement for shell
scripting. For others, it serves as a convenient, high-level
replacement for most of what theyd program in low-level
languages like C or C++. Its ultimately up to you (and
possibly your management) which tasks youll use Perl for and
which you wont.</p>

<p>If you have a library that provides an API, you can make
any component of it available as just another Perl function
or variable using a Perl extension written in C or C++ and
dynamically linked into your main perl interpreter. You can
also go the other direction, and write your main program in
C or C++, and then link in some Perl code on the fly, to
create a powerful application. See perlembed.</p>

<p>That said, there will always be small, focused,
special-purpose languages dedicated to a specific problem
domain that are simply more convenient for certain kinds of
problems. Perl tries to be all things to all people, but
nothing special to anyone. Examples of specialized languages
that come to mind include prolog and matlab.</p>

<p>When shouldt I program in Perl? When your manager
forbids it--but do consider replacing them :-).</p>

<p>Actually, one good reason is when you already have an
existing application written in another language that s all
done (and done well), or you have an application language
specifically designed for a certain task (e.g. prolog,
make).</p>

<p>For various reasons, Perl is probably not well-suited
for real-time embedded systems, low-level operating systems
development work like device drivers or context-switching
code, complex multi-threaded shared-memory applications, or
extremely large applications. Youll notice that perl is not
itself written in Perl.</p>

<p>Perl remains fundamentally a dynamically typed language,
not a statically typed one. You certainly wont be chastised
if you dont trust nuclear-plant or brain-surgery monitoring
code to it. And Larry will sleep easier, too--Wall Street
programs not withstanding. :-)</p>

<p>Whas the difference between &quot;perl&quot; and
&quot;Perl&quot;? One bit. Oh, you werent talking ASCII? :-)
Larry now uses &quot;Perl&quot; to signify the language
proper and &quot;perl&quot; the implementation of it, i.e.
the current interpreter. Hence Toms quip that &quot;Nothing
but perl can parse Perl.&quot;</p>

<p>Before the first edition of Programming perl, people
commonly referred to the language as &quot;perl&quot;, and
its name appeared that way in the title because it referred
to the interpreter. In the book, Randal Schwartz capitalised
the languages name to make it stand out better when typeset.
This convention was adopted by the community, and the second
edition became Programming Perl, using the capitalized
version of the name to refer to the language.</p>

<p>You may or may not choose to follow this usage. For
example, parallelism means &quot;awk and perl&quot; and
&quot;Python and Perl&quot; look good, while &quot;awk and
Perl&quot; and &quot;Python and perl&quot; do not. But never
write &quot;PERL&quot;, because perl is not an acronym,
apocryphal folklore and post-facto expansions
notwithstanding.</p>

<p>Is it a Perl program or a Perl script? Larry doesnt
really care. He says (half in jest) that &quot;a script is
what you give the actors. A program is what you give the
audience.&quot;</p>

<p>Originally, a script was a canned sequence of normally
interactive commands--that is, a chat script. Something like
a UUCP or PPP chat script or an expect script fits the bill
nicely, as do configuration scripts run by a program at its
start up, such .cshrc or .ircrc, for example. Chat scripts
were just drivers for existing programs, not stand-alone
programs in their own right.</p>

<p>A computer scientist will correctly explain that all
programs are interpreted and that the only question is at
what level. But if you ask this question of someone who isn
t a computer scientist, they might tell you that a program
has been compiled to physical machine code once and can then
be run multiple times, whereas a script must be translated
by a program each time its used.</p>

<p>Now that &quot;script&quot; and &quot;scripting&quot;
are terms that have been seized by unscrupulous or unknowing
marketeers for their own nefarious purposes, they have begun
to take on strange and often pejorative meanings, like
&quot;non serious&quot; or &quot;not real programming&quot;.
Consequently, some Perl programmers prefer to avoid them
altogether.</p>

<p>What is a JAPH? (contributed by brian d foy)</p>

<p>JAPH stands for &quot;Just another Perl hacker,&quot;,
which Randal Schwartz used to sign email and usenet messages
starting in the late 1980s. He previously used the phrase
with many subjects (&quot;Just another x hacker,&quot;), so
to distinguish his JAPH, he started to write them as Perl
programs:</p>

<p>print &quot;Just another Perl hacker,&quot;;</p>

<p>Other people picked up on this and started to write
clever or obfuscated programs to produce the same output,
spinning things quickly out of control while still providing
hours of amusement for their creators and readers.</p>

<p>CPAN has several JAPH programs at
http://www.cpan.org/misc/japh .</p>

<p>Where can I get a list of Larry Wall witticisms?
(contributed by brian d foy)</p>

<p>Google &quot;larry wall quotes&quot;! You might even try
the &quot;I feel lucky&quot; button. :)</p>

<p>Wikiquote has the witticisms from Larry along with their
source, including his usenet postings and source code
comments.</p>

<p>If you want a plain text file, try
http://www.cpan.org/misc/lwall-quotes.txt.gz .</p>

<p>How can I convince others to use Perl? (contributed by
brian d foy)</p>

<p>Appeal to their self interest! If Perl is new (and thus
scary) to them, find something that Perl can do to solve one
of their problems. That might mean that Perl either saves
them something (time, headaches, money) or gives them
something (flexibility, power, testability).</p>

<p>In general, the benefit of a language is closely related
to the skill of the people using that language. If you or
your team can be more faster, better, and stronger through
Perl, youll deliver more value. Remember, people often
respond better to what they get out of it. If you run into
resistance, figure out what those people get out of the
other choice and how Perl might satisfy that
requirement.</p>

<p>You don t have to worry about finding or paying for
Perl; its freely available and several popular operating
systems come with Perl. Community support in places such as
Perlmonks ( http://www.perlmonks.com ) and the various Perl
mailing lists ( http://lists.perl.org ) means that you can
usually get quick answers to your problems.</p>

<p>Finally, keep in mind that Perl might not be the right
tool for every job. Youre a much better advocate if your
claims are reasonable and grounded in reality. Dogmatically
advocating anything tends to make people discount your
message. Be honest about possible disadvantages to your
choice of Perl since any choice has trade-offs.</p>
