<p>WCSTOK(3) Linux Programmer s Manual WCSTOK(3)</p>

<p>NAME wcstok - split wide-character string into
tokens</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;wchar.h&gt;</p>

<p>wchar_t *wcstok(wchar_t *wcs, const wchar_t *delim,
wchar_t **ptr);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The wcstok() function is the wide-character
equivalent of the strtok(3) function, with an added argument
to make it multithread-safe. It can be used to split a
wide-character string wcs into tokens, where a token is
defined as a substring not containing any wide-characters
from delim.</p>

<p>The search starts at wcs, if wcs is not NULL, or at
*ptr, if wcs is NULL. First, any delimiter wide-characters
are skipped, that is, the pointer is advanced beyond any
wide-characters which occur in delim. If the end of the
wide-character string is now reached, wcstok() returns NULL,
to indicate that no tokens were found, and stores an
appropriate value in *ptr, so that subsequent calls to
wcstok() will continue to return NULL. Otherwise, the
wcstok() function recognizes the beginning of a token and
returns a pointer to it, but before doing that, it
zero-terminates the token by replacing the next
wide-character which occurs in delim with a L&rsquo; &rsquo;
character, and it updates *ptr so that subsequent calls will
continue searching after the end of recog- nized token.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The wcstok() function returns a pointer to
the next token, or NULL if no further token was found.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO C99.</p>

<p>NOTES The original wcs wide-character string is
destructively modified during the operation.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE The following code loops over the tokens
contained in a wide-character string.</p>

<p>wchar_t *wcs = ...; wchar_t *token; wchar_t *state; for
(token = wcstok(wcs, &quot; 0, &amp;state); token != NULL;
token = wcstok(NULL, &quot; 0, &amp;state)) { ... }</p>
