<p>NAME perlivp - Perl Installation Verification
Procedure</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS perlivp [-a] [-p] [-v] [-h]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The perlivp program is set up at Perl source
code build time to test the Perl version it was built under.
It can be used after running:</p>

<p>make install</p>

<p>(or your platforms equivalent procedure) to verify that
perl and its libraries have been installed correctly. A
correct installation is verified by output that looks
like:</p>

<p>ok 1 ok 2</p>

<p>etc.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -h help Prints out a brief help message.</p>

<p>-a run all tests Normally tests for optional features
are skipped. With -a all tests are executed.</p>

<p>-p print preface Gives a description of each test prior
to performing it.</p>

<p>-v verbose Gives more detailed information about each
test, after it has been performed. Note that any failed
tests ought to print out some extra information whether or
not -v is thrown.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS &middot; print &quot;# Perl binary $perlpath
does not appear executable.0;</p>

<p>Likely to occur for a perl binary that was not properly
installed. Correct by conducting a proper installation.</p>

<p>&middot; print &quot;# Perl version $] installed,
expected $ivp_VERSION.0;</p>

<p>Likely to occur for a perl that was not properly
installed. Correct by conducting a proper installation.</p>

<p>&middot; print &quot;# Perl @INC directory $_ does not
appear to exist.0;</p>

<p>Likely to occur for a perl library tree that was not
properly installed. Correct by conducting a proper
installation.</p>

<p>&middot; print &quot;# Needed module $_ does not appear
to be properly installed.0;</p>

<p>One of the two modules that is used by perlivp was not
present in the installation. This is a serious error since
it adversely affects perlivps ability to function. You may
be able to correct this by performing a proper perl
installation.</p>

<p>&middot; print &quot;# Required module $_ does not
appear to be properly installed.0;</p>

<p>An attempt to &quot;eval &quot;require
$module&quot;&quot; failed, even though the list of
extensions indicated that it should succeed. Correct by
conducting a proper installation.</p>

<p>&middot; print &quot;# Unnecessary module bLuRfle
appears to be installed.0;</p>

<p>This test not coming out ok could indicate that you have
in fact installed a bLuRfle.pm module or that the &quot;eval
&quot; require</p>

<p>installation of perl. If yours is the latter case then
please let the author know.</p>

<p>&middot; print &quot;# file&quot;,+($#missing == 0) ? :
s,&quot; missing from installation:0;</p>

<p>One or more files turned up missing according to a run
of &quot;ExtUtils::Installed -&gt; validate()&quot; over
your installation. Correct by conducting a proper
installation.</p>

<p>&middot; print &quot;# Perl header $_ does not appear to
be properly installed.0;</p>

<p>Correct by running h2ph over your system s C header
files. If necessary, edit the resulting *.ph files to
eliminate perl syntax errors.</p>

<p>For further information on how to conduct a proper
installation consult the INSTALL file that comes with the
perl source and the README file for your platform.</p>
