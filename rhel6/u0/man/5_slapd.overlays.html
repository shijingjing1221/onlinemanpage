<p>SLAPD.OVERLAYS(5) SLAPD.OVERLAYS(5)</p>

<p>NAME slapd.overlays - overlays for slapd, the
stand-alone LDAP daemon</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The slapd(8) daemon can use a variety of
different overlays to alter or extend the normal behavior of
a database backend. Overlays may be com- piled statically
into slapd, or when module support is enabled, they may be
dynamically loaded. Most of the overlays are only allowed to
be configured on individual databases, but some may also be
configured globally.</p>

<p>Configuration options for each overlay are documented
separately in the corresponding slapo-&lt;overlay&gt;(5)
manual pages.</p>

<p>accesslog Access Logging. This overlay can record
accesses to a given backend database on another
database.</p>

<p>auditlog Audit Logging. This overlay records changes on
a given backend database to an LDIF log file. By default it
is not built.</p>

<p>chain Chaining. This overlay allows automatic referral
chasing when a referral would have been returned, either
when configured by the server or when requested by the
client.</p>

<p>constraint Constraint. This overlay enforces a regular
expression con- straint on all values of specified
attributes. It is used to enforce a more rigorous syntax
when the underlying attribute syntax is too general.</p>

<p>dds Dynamic Directory Services. This overlay supports
dynamic objects, which have a limited life after which they
expire and are automatically deleted.</p>

<p>dyngroup Dynamic Group. This is a demo overlay which
extends the Compare operation to detect members of a dynamic
group. It has no effect on any other operations.</p>

<p>dynlist Dynamic List. This overlay allows expansion of
dynamic groups and more.</p>

<p>pcache Proxycache. This overlay allows caching of LDAP
search requests in a local database. It is most often used
with the slapd-ldap(5) or slapd-meta(5) backends.</p>

<p>ppolicy Password Policy. This overlay provides a variety
of password control mechanisms, e.g. password aging,
password reuse and duplication control, mandatory password
resets, etc.</p>

<p>refint Referential Integrity. This overlay can be used
with a backend database such as slapd-bdb(5) to maintain the
cohesiveness of a schema which utilizes reference
attributes.</p>

<p>retcode Return Code. This overlay is useful to test the
behavior of clients when server-generated erroneous and/or
unusual responses occur.</p>

<p>rwm Rewrite/remap. This overlay is experimental. It
performs basic DN/data rewrite and objectClass/attributeType
mapping.</p>

<p>syncprov Syncrepl Provider. This overlay implements the
provider-side support for syncrepl replication, including
persistent search functionality.</p>

<p>translucent Translucent Proxy. This overlay can be used
with a backend database such as slapd-bdb(5) to create a
&quot;translucent proxy&quot;. Content of entries retrieved
from a remote LDAP server can be partially overridden by the
database.</p>

<p>unique Attribute Uniqueness. This overlay can be used
with a backend database such as slapd-bdb(5) to enforce the
uniqueness of some or all attributes within a subtree.</p>

<p>valsort Value Sorting. This overlay can be used to
enforce a specific order for the values of an attribute when
it is returned in a search.</p>
