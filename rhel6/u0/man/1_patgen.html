<p>NAME patgen - generate patterns for TeX hyphenation</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS patgen dictionary_file pattern_file patout_file
translate_file</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page is not meant to be
exhaustive. The complete documen- tation for this version of
TeX can be found in the info file or manual Web2C: A TeX
implementation.</p>

<p>The patgen program reads the dictionary_file containing
a list of hyphenated words and the pattern_file containing
previously-generated patterns (if any) for a particular
language, and produces the patout_file with (previously-
plus newly-generated) hyphenation pat- terns for that
language. The translate_file defines language specific
values for the parameters left_hyphen_min and
right_hyphen_min used by TeX s hyphenation algorithm and the
external representation of the lower and upper case
version(s) of all &lsquo;letters of that language. Fur- ther
details of the pattern generation process such as
hyphenation lev- els and pattern lengths are requested
interactively from the users terminal. Optionally patgen
creates a new dictionary file pattmp.n showing the good and
bad hyphens found by the generated patterns, where n is the
highest hypenation level.</p>

<p>The patterns generated by patgen can be read by initex
for use in hyphenating words. For a (very) long example of
patgen s output, see
$TEXMFMAIN/tex/generic/hyphen/hyphen.tex, which contains the
patterns TeX uses for English. At some sites, patterns for
several other lan- guages may be available, and the local
tex programs may have them preloaded; consult your Local
Guide or your system administrator for details.</p>

<p>All filenames must be complete; no adding of default
extensions or path searching is done.</p>

<p>FILE FORMATS Letters When initex digests hyphenation
patterns, TeX first expands macros and the result must
entirely consist of digits (hyphenation lev- els), dots
(&lsquo;., edge of a word), and letters. In pattern files
for non-English languages letters are often represented by
macros or other expandable constructs. For the purpose of
patgen these are just character sequences, subject to the
condition that no such sequence is a prefix of another
one.</p>

<p>Dictionary file A dictionary file contains a weighted
list of hyphenated words, one word per line starting in
column 1. A digit in column 1 indicates a global word weight
(initially =1) applicable to all following words up to the
next global word weight. A digit at some intercharacter
position indicates a weight for that position only.</p>

<p>The hyphens in a word are indicated by &lsquo;-,
&lsquo;*, or &lsquo;. (or their replacements as defined in
the translate file) for hyphens yet to be found, &lsquo;good
hyphens (correctly found by the patterns), and &lsquo;bad
hyphens (erroneously found by the patterns) respectively;
when reading a dictionary file &lsquo;* is treated like
&lsquo;- and &lsquo;. is ignored.</p>

<p>Translate file A translate file starts with a line
containing the values of left_hypen_min in columns 1-2,
right_hyphen_min in columns 3-4, and either a blank or the
replacement for one of the &quot;hyphen&quot; charac- ters
&lsquo;-, &lsquo;*, and &lsquo;. in columns 5, 6, and 7.
(Input lines are padded with blanks as for many TeX related
programs.)</p>

<p>Each following line defines one &lsquo;letter : an
arbitrary delimiter character in column 1, followed by one
or more external representa- tions of that character (first
the &lsquo;lower case one used for out- put), each one
terminated by the delimiter and the whole sequence
terminated by another delimiter.</p>

<p>If the translate file is empty, the values
left_hypen_min=2, right_hyphen_min=3, and the 26 lower case
letters a...z with their upper case representations A...Z
are assumed.</p>

<p>Terminal input After reading the translate_file and any
previously-generated pat- terns from pattern_file, patgen
requests input from the users ter- minal.</p>

<p>First the integer values of hyph_start and hyph_finish,
the lowest and highest hyphenation level for which patterns
are to be gener- ated. The value of hyph_start should be
larger than any hyphenation level already present in
pattern_file.</p>

<p>Then, for each hyphenation level, the integer values of
pat_start and pat_finish, the smallest and largest pattern
length to be ana- lyzed, as well as good weight, bad weight,
and threshold, the weights for good and bad hyphens and a
weight threshold for useful patterns.</p>

<p>Finally the decision (&lsquo;y or &lsquo;Y vs. anything
else) whether or not to produce a hypenated word list.</p>

<p>AUTHORS Frank Liang wrote the first version of this
program. Peter Breiten- lohner made a substantial revision
in 1991 for TeX 3. The first ver- sion was published as the
appendix to the TeX for nroffware technical report,
available from the TeX Users Group. Howard Trickey
originally ported it to Unix.</p>
