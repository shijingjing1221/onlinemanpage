<p>STRINGS(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual STRINGS(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME strings - find printable strings in files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS strings [-a][-t format][-n number][file...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The strings utility shall look for printable
strings in regular files and shall write those strings to
standard output. A printable string is any sequence of four
(by default) or more printable characters termi- nated by a
&lt;newline&gt; or NUL character. Additional implementation-
defined strings may be written; see localedef.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The strings utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>The following options shall be supported:</p>

<p>-a Scan files in their entirety. If -a is not specified,
it is implementation-defined what portion of each file is
scanned for strings.</p>

<p>-n number Specify the minimum string length, where the
number argument is a positive decimal integer. The default
shall be 4.</p>

<p>-t format Write each string preceded by its byte offset
from the start of the file. The format shall be dependent on
the single character used as the format option-argument:</p>

<p>d The offset shall be written in decimal.</p>

<p>o The offset shall be written in octal.</p>

<p>x The offset shall be written in hexadecimal.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p>file A pathname of a regular file to be used as input.
If no file operand is specified, the strings utility shall
read from the standard input.</p>

<p>STDIN See the INPUT FILES section.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES The input files named by the utility
arguments or the standard input shall be regular files of
any format.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of strings:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments
and input files) and to identify printable strings.</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT Strings found shall be written to the standard
output, one per line.</p>

<p>When the -t option is not specified, the format of the
output shall be:</p>

<p>&quot;%s&quot;, &lt;string&gt;</p>

<p>With the -t o option, the format of the output shall
be:</p>

<p>&quot;%o %s&quot;, &lt;byte offset&gt;,
&lt;string&gt;</p>

<p>With the -t x option, the format of the output shall
be:</p>

<p>&quot;%x %s&quot;, &lt;byte offset&gt;,
&lt;string&gt;</p>

<p>With the -t d option, the format of the output shall
be:</p>

<p>&quot;%d %s&quot;, &lt;byte offset&gt;,
&lt;string&gt;</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 Successful completion.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE By default the data area (as opposed
to the text, &quot;bss&quot;, or header areas) of a binary
executable file is scanned. Implementations docu- ment which
areas are scanned.</p>

<p>Some historical implementations do not require NUL or
&lt;newline&gt; termi- nators for strings to permit those
languages that do not use NUL as a string terminator to have
their strings written.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE Apart from rationalizing the option syntax and
slight difficulties with object and executable binary files,
strings is specified to match his- torical practice closely.
The -a and -n options were introduced to replace the
non-conforming - and - number options.</p>

<p>The -o option historically means different things on
different imple- mentations. Some use it to mean &quot;
offset in decimal&quot;, while others use it as &quot;
offset in octal&quot;. Instead of trying to decide which way
would be least objectionable, the -t option was added. It
was originally named -O to mean &quot;offset&quot;, but was
changed to -t to be consistent with od.</p>

<p>The ISO C standard function isprint() is restricted to a
domain of unsigned char. This volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001
requires implementa- tions to write strings as defined by
the current locale.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
