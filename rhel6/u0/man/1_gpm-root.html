<p>GPM-ROOT(1) GPM-ROOT(1)</p>

<p>NAME gpm-root - a default handler for gpm, used to draw
menus on the root window</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS gpm-root [ options ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The program gpm-root is designed to handle
Control-Mouse events to draw menus on the background of the
current tty. The actual menus are described by a
configuration file in the users home directory.</p>

<p>Please note that gpm-root needs to run with Linux 1.1.73
or newer, because previous kernels lack some screen handling
capabilities required by the program.</p>

<p>The program uses the files /dev/vcs* to draw to the
console screen. These are available only from kernel 1.1.81
onward. If you miss those device nodes, you should create
them using create_vcs in the distribu- tion directory. The
tool wont run with kernels older than 1.1.81, because they
lacked a full screen dump/restore capability.</p>

<p>Available command line options are the following:</p>

<p>-m number Choose the modifier to use (by default:
control). The modifier can be provided either as a number or
as a symbolic string. Allowed strings are shift, anyAlt,
leftAlt, rightAlt, control.</p>

<p>-u Deny using user-specific configuration files. With
this option on, only /etc/gpm-root.conf will be used as a
source of configu- ration information. This option is
intended for those system administrators who fear security
could be broken by this daemon. Things should be
sufficiently secure, but if you find a hole please tell me
about it.</p>

<p>-D Do not automatically enter background operation when
started, and log messages to the standard error stream, not
the syslog mechanism. This is useful for debugging; in
previous releases it was done with a compile-time
option.</p>

<p>-V verbosity increment Raise the maximum level of
messages that will be logged. Thus a positive argument has
the effect of making the program more ver- bose. One can
also give a negative argument to hush the pro- gram;
however, note that due to getopt(3) rules a negative argu-
ment must follow the option with no space betwixt (that is,
-V-1 but not -V -1). Program Arguments,,,libc. The argument
is optional and its default value is 1.</p>

<p>Each time a menu is drawn, the configuration file is
reparsed if it has changed. This allows modification of
personal setup without reinvoking the daemon.</p>

<p>The actual configuration file is better introduced by
looking at your /etc/gpm-root.conf.</p>

<p>The syntax for the file wont be described here, being it
quite appar- ent from the example above. Blanks and newlines
are unused in parsing the file, and the layout of the file
is free. Comments are allowed in the file: any hash mark (#)
found at the beginning of the line or after white space
makes the parser discard anything up to the next line. To
insert quotes (&quot;) in strings precede them with a
backslash.</p>

<p>Note that recursive menus are allowed, to any level of
recursion.</p>

<p>Keywords belong to three groups: the button keyword, the
cfg keywords and the action keywords. They are all described
in the table below:</p>

<p>button number menu The button keyword is used to
introduce a menu. It is followed by the number of the
relevant button (1=left, 2=middle, 3=right), an open brace,
a menu and a closed brace. A menu is made up of cfg
statements, followed by action statements. Cfg statements
can come in any order, while the order of action statements
tells the actual order in which actions will appear on the
screen, top to bottom.</p>

<p>The following statements belong to the cfg set.</p>

<p>name string If the name keyword is present, the
specified string will be used as the name for the current
menu.</p>

<p>background color This statements is used to specify the
background color to be used in the current menu. The color
can be specified with one of the eight canonical strings
black, red, cyan etc. The background defaults to black.</p>

<p>foreground color This statements is used to specify the
foreground color for menu items. Its value defaults to
white. An optional bright keyword can appear before the
actual color.</p>

<p>border color border is used to specify the border color
for the menu. Its value defaults to white. An optional
bright keyword can appear before the actual color.</p>

<p>head color head is used to specify the foreground color
for the title of the menu. Its value defaults to white. An
optional bright key- word can appear before the actual
color.</p>

<p>The following statements belong to the action set.</p>

<p>string f.fgcmd cmdstring When the mouse button is
released above the corresponding menu item, the cmdstring is
pasted in the keyboard queue of the cur- rent console. This
is not yet implemented.</p>

<p>string f.bgcmd cmdstring When the mouse button is
released above the corresponding menu item, a shell
(/bin/sh) is forked to execute the specified com- mand, with
stdin connected to /dev/null, and stdout, stderr con- nected
to the active console.</p>

<p>string f.jptty ttynumber When the mouse button is
released above the corresponding menu item, the console is
switched to the one specified. The ttynum- ber must be
specified as a string. Any tty can be reached this way, even
those which are not accessible via the keyboard.</p>

<p>string f.mktty ttynumber When the mouse button is
released above the corresponding menu item, an unused
console is selected, and /sbin/mingetty is exe- cuted in it.
The current console is switched to the newly opened console.
I use this command to save kernel memory by opening a single
console through /etc/inittab and requesting the others only
when i need to login.</p>

<p>string Whole-menu A menu can directly follow the label
string. When the mouse pointer leaves the menu frame at the
level of string, a second menu is posted on screen.</p>

<p>string f.lock When the mouse button is released above
the corresponding menu item, the keyboard and the screen are
locked, and only the lock- ing user or the superuser can
unlock them. This is not yet implemented.</p>

<p>string f.load The current loadavg when the menu is
posted is concatenated to string to build the actual message
displayed on screen. Nothing happens at button release.</p>

<p>string f.free The free memory and swap when the menu is
posted is concatenated to string to build the actual message
displayed on screen. Noth- ing happens at button
release.</p>

<p>string f.time The current time is formatted with
strftime(3), according to string. The resulting string is
the actual message displayed on screen. Nothing happens at
button release.</p>

<p>string f.pipe cmdline When the mouse pointer leaves the
menu frame at the level of string, a message box is posted
on screen showing the last ten lines of the output of
cmdline. cmdline is executed by /bin/sh. This is not yet
implemented.</p>

<p>string f.nop This does nothing, it only displays string
on the menu.</p>

<p>The HOME, LOGNAME and USER environment variables are
setup to the val- ues for the invoking user before spawning
an external process (f.bgcmd, f.pipe). The current directory
is always /.</p>

<p>BUGS Known bugs have been fixed. In particular, if you
invoke gpm-root right after gpm, it will delay a few seconds
before trying to connect to the daemon.</p>
