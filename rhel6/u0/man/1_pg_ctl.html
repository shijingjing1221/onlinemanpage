<p>DESCRIPTION pg_ctl is a utility for starting, stopping,
or restarting the Post- greSQL backend server (postgres(1)),
or displaying the status of a run- ning server. Although the
server can be started manually, pg_ctl encap- sulates tasks
such as redirecting log output and properly detaching from
the terminal and process group. It also provides convenient
options for controlled shutdown.</p>

<p>In start mode, a new server is launched. The server is
started in the background, and standard input is attached to
/dev/null. The standard output and standard error are either
appended to a log file (if the -l option is used), or
redirected to pg_ctls standard output (not stan- dard
error). If no log file is chosen, the standard output of
pg_ctl should be redirected to a file or piped to another
process such as a log rotating program like rotatelogs;
otherwise postgres will write its output to the controlling
terminal (from the background) and will not leave the shells
process group.</p>

<p>In stop mode, the server that is running in the
specified data direc- tory is shut down. Three different
shutdown methods can be selected with the -m option: Smart
mode waits for online backup mode to fin- ish and all the
clients to disconnect. This is the default. Fast mode does
not wait for clients to disconnect and will terminate an
online backup in progress. All active transactions are
rolled back and clients are forcibly disconnected, then the
server is shut down. Immediate mode will abort all server
processes without a clean shutdown. This will lead to a
recovery run on restart.</p>

<p>restart mode effectively executes a stop followed by a
start. This allows changing the postgres command-line
options.</p>

<p>reload mode simply sends the postgres process a SIGHUP
signal, causing it to reread its configuration files
(postgresql.conf, pg_hba.conf, etc.). This allows changing
of configuration-file options that do not require a complete
restart to take effect.</p>

<p>status mode checks whether a server is running in the
specified data directory. If it is, the PID and the command
line options that were used to invoke it are displayed.</p>

<p>kill mode allows you to send a signal to a specified
process. This is particularly valuable for Microsoft Windows
which does not have a kill command. Use --help to see a list
of supported signal names.</p>

<p>register mode allows you to register a system service on
Microsoft Win- dows.</p>

<p>unregister mode allows you to unregister a system
service on Microsoft Windows, previously registered with the
register command.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -c Attempt to allow server crashes to produce
core files, on plat- forms where this available, by lifting
any soft resource limit placed on them. This is useful in
debugging or diagnosing prob- lems by allowing a stack trace
to be obtained from a failed server process.</p>

<p>-D datadir Specifies the file system location of the
database files. If this is omitted, the environment variable
PGDATA is used.</p>

<p>-l filename Append the server log output to filename. If
the file does not exist, it is created. The umask is set to
077, so access to the log file from other users is
disallowed by default.</p>

<p>-m mode Specifies the shutdown mode. mode can be smart,
fast, or immedi- ate, or the first letter of one of these
three.</p>

<p>-o options Specifies options to be passed directly to
the postgres command.</p>

<p>The options are usually surrounded by single or double
quotes to ensure that they are passed through as a
group.</p>

<p>-p path Specifies the location of the postgres
executable. By default the postgres executable is taken from
the same directory as pg_ctl, or failing that, the
hard-wired installation directory. It is not necessary to
use this option unless you are doing something unusual and
get errors that the postgres executable was not found.</p>

<p>-s Only print errors, no informational messages.</p>

<p>-t The number of seconds to wait when waiting for start
or shutdown to complete.</p>

<p>-w Wait for the start or shutdown to complete. The
default wait time is 60 seconds. This is the default option
for shutdowns. A successful shutdown is indicated by removal
of the PID file. For starting up, a successful psql -l
indicates success. pg_ctl will attempt to use the proper
port for psql. If the environment variable PGPORT exists,
that is used. Otherwise, it will see if a port has been set
in the postgresql.conf file. If neither of those is used, it
will use the default port that PostgreSQL was compiled with
(5432 by default). When waiting, pg_ctl will return an
accurate exit code based on the success of the startup or
shutdown.</p>

<p>-W Do not wait for start or shutdown to complete. This
is the default for starts and restarts.</p>

<p>OPTIONS FOR WINDOWS -N servicename Name of the system
service to register. The name will be used as both the
service name and the display name.</p>

<p>-P password Password for the user to start the
service.</p>

<p>-U username User name for the user to start the service.
For domain users, use the format DOMAINsername.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT PGDATA Default data directory location.</p>

<p>PGPORT Default port for psql(1) (used by the -w
option).</p>

<p>For additional server variables, see postgres(1). This
utility, like most other PostgreSQL utilities, also uses the
environment variables supported by libpq (see in the
documentation).</p>

<p>FILES postmaster.pid The existence of this file in the
data directory is used to help pg_ctl determine if the
server is currently running or not.</p>

<p>postmaster.opts If this file exists in the data
directory, pg_ctl (in restart mode) will pass the contents
of the file as options to postgres, unless overridden by the
-o option. The contents of this file are also displayed in
status mode.</p>

<p>postgresql.conf This file, located in the data
directory, is parsed to find the proper port to use with
psql when the -w is given in start mode.</p>

<p>NOTES Waiting for complete start is not a well-defined
operation and might fail if access control is set up so that
a local client cannot connect without manual interaction
(e.g., password authentication). For addi- tional connection
variables, see in the documentation, and for pass- words,
also see in the documentation.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES STARTING THE SERVER To start up a server:</p>

<p>$ pg_ctl start</p>

<p>An example of starting the server, blocking until the
server has come up is:</p>

<p>$ pg_ctl -w start</p>

<p>For a server using port 5433, and running without fsync,
use:</p>

<p>$ pg_ctl -o &quot;-F -p 5433&quot; start</p>

<p>STOPPING THE SERVER $ pg_ctl stop</p>

<p>stops the server. Using the -m switch allows one to
control how the backend shuts down.</p>

<p>RESTARTING THE SERVER Restarting the server is almost
equivalent to stopping the server and starting it again
except that pg_ctl saves and reuses the command line options
that were passed to the previously running instance. To
restart the server in the simplest form, use:</p>

<p>$ pg_ctl restart</p>

<p>To restart server, waiting for it to shut down and to
come up:</p>

<p>$ pg_ctl -w restart</p>

<p>To restart using port 5433 and disabling fsync after
restarting:</p>

<p>$ pg_ctl -o &quot;-F -p 5433&quot; restart</p>

<p>SHOWING THE SERVER STATUS Here is a sample status output
from pg_ctl:</p>

<p>$ pg_ctl status pg_ctl: server is running (pid: 13718)
Command line was: /usr/local/pgsql/bin/postgres -D
/usr/local/pgsql/data -p 5433 -B 128</p>

<p>This is the command line that would be invoked in
restart mode.</p>
