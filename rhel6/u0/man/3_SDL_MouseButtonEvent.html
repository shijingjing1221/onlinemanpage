SDL_MouseButtonEvent(3)</p>

<p>NAME SDL_MouseButtonEvent - Mouse button event
structure</p>

<p>STRUCTURE DEFINITION typedef struct{ Uint8 type; Uint8
button; Uint8 state; Uint16 x, y; }
SDL_MouseButtonEvent;</p>

<p>STRUCTURE DATA type SDL_MOUSEBUTTONDOWN or
SDL_MOUSEBUTTONUP</p>

<p>button The mouse button index (SDL_BUTTON_LEFT, SDL_BUT-
TON_MIDDLE, SDL_BUTTON_RIGHT)</p>

<p>state SDL_PRESSED or SDL_RELEASED</p>

<p>x, y The X/Y coordinates of the mouse at press/release
time</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION SDL_MouseButtonEvent is a member of the
SDL_Event union and is used when an event of type
SDL_MOUSEBUTTONDOWN or SDL_MOUSEBUTTONUP is reported.</p>

<p>When a mouse button press or release is detected then
number of the button pressed (from 1 to 255, with 1 usually
being the left button and 2 the right) is placed into
button, the position of the mouse when this event occured is
stored in the x and the y fields. Like SDL_KeyboardE- vent,
information on whether the event was a press or a release
event is stored in both the type and state fields, but this
should be obvi- ous.</p>
