<p>AIO_CANCEL(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
AIO_CANCEL(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME aio_cancel - cancel an asynchronous I/O request
(REALTIME)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;aio.h&gt;</p>

<p>int aio_cancel(int fildes, struct aiocb *aiocbp);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The aio_cancel() function shall attempt to
cancel one or more asyn- chronous I/O requests currently
outstanding against file descriptor fildes. The aiocbp
argument points to the asynchronous I/O control block for a
particular request to be canceled. If aiocbp is NULL, then
all outstanding cancelable asynchronous I/O requests against
fildes shall be canceled.</p>

<p>Normal asynchronous notification shall occur for
asynchronous I/O oper- ations that are successfully
canceled. If there are requests that can- not be canceled,
then the normal asynchronous completion process shall take
place for those requests when they are completed.</p>

<p>For requested operations that are successfully canceled,
the associated error status shall be set to [ECANCELED] and
the return status shall be -1. For requested operations that
are not successfully canceled, the aiocbp shall not be
modified by aio_cancel().</p>

<p>If aiocbp is not NULL, then if fildes does not have the
same value as the file descriptor with which the
asynchronous operation was initi- ated, unspecified results
occur.</p>

<p>Which operations are cancelable is
implementation-defined.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The aio_cancel() function shall return the
value AIO_CANCELED to the calling process if the requested
operation(s) were canceled. The value AIO_NOTCANCELED shall
be returned if at least one of the requested operation(s)
cannot be canceled because it is in progress. In this case,
the state of the other operations, if any, referenced in the
call to aio_cancel() is not indicated by the return value of
aio_cancel(). The application may determine the state of
affairs for these operations by using aio_error(). The value
AIO_ALLDONE is returned if all of the operations have
already completed. Otherwise, the function shall return -1
and set errno to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The aio_cancel() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EBADF The fildes argument is not a valid file
descriptor.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The aio_cancel() function is part of
the Asynchronous Input and Output option and need not be
available on all implementations.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
