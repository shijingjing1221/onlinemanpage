<p>PCI_DEV_GET(9) Hardware Interfaces PCI_DEV_GET(9)</p>

<p>NAME pci_dev_get - increments the reference count of the
pci device structure</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS struct pci_dev * pci_dev_get(struct pci_dev *
dev);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS dev the device being referenced</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Each live reference to a device should be
refcounted.</p>

<p>Drivers for PCI devices should normally record such
references in their probe methods, when they bind to a
device, and release them by calling pci_dev_put, in their
disconnect methods.</p>

<p>A pointer to the device with the incremented reference
counter is returned.</p>
