<p>XkbListComponents(3) XKB FUNCTIONS
XkbListComponents(3)</p>

<p>NAME XkbListComponents - List of components for one or
more component types</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS XkbComponentListPtr XkbListComponents (Display
*dpy, unsigned int device_spec, XkbComponentNamesPtr ptrns,
int *max_inout);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS - dpy connection to X server</p>

<p>- device_spec device ID, or XkbUseCoreKbd</p>

<p>- ptrns namelist for components of interest</p>

<p>- max_inout max # returned names, # left over</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION You may ask the server for a list of
components for one or more compo- nent types. The request
takes the form of a set of patterns, one pat- tern for each
of the component types, including a pattern for the com-
plete keyboard description. To obtain this list, use
XkbListComponents.</p>

<p>XkbListComponents queries the server for a list of
component names matching the patterns specified in ptrns. It
waits for a reply and returns the matching component names
in an XkbComponentListRec struc- ture. When you are done
using the structure, you should free it using
XkbFreeComponentList. device_spec indicates a particular
device in which the caller is interested. A server is
allowed (but not required) to restrict its reply to portions
of the database that are relevant for that particular
device.</p>

<p>ptrns is a pointer to an XkbComponentNamesRec. Each of
the fields in ptrns contains a pattern naming the components
of interest. Each of the patterns is composed of characters
from the ISO Latin1 encoding, but can contain only
parentheses, the wildcard characters ? and *, and characters
permitted in a component class or member name. A pattern may
be NULL, in which case no components for that type is
returned. Pattern matches with component names are case
sensitive. The ? wildcard matches any single character,
except a left or right parenthesis; the * wildcard matches
any number of characters, except a left or right
parenthesis. If an implementation allows additional
characters in a component class or member name other than
those required by the Xkb extension, the result of comparing
one of the additional characters to either of the wildcard
characters is implementation-dependent.</p>

<p>If a pattern contains illegal characters, the illegal
characters are ignored. The matching process is carried out
as if the illegal charac- ters were omitted from the
pattern.</p>

<p>max_inout is used to throttle the amount of data passed
to and from the server. On input, it specifies the maximum
number of names to be returned (the total number of names in
all component categories). Upon return from
XkbListComponents, max_inout contains the number of names
that matched the request but were not returned because of
the limit.</p>

<p>Component Names</p>

<p>Component names have the form class(member) where class
describes a subset of the available components for a
particular type and the optional member identifies a
specific component from that subset. For example, the name
&quot;atlantis(acme)&quot; for a symbols component might
spec- ify the symbols used for the atlantis national
keyboard layout by the vendor &quot;acme.&quot; Each class
has an optional default member - references that specify a
class but not a member refer to the default member of the
class, if one exists. Xkb places no constraints on the
interpreta- tion of the class and member names used in
component names.</p>

<p>The class and member names are both specified using
characters from the Latin-1 character set. Xkb
implementations must accept all alphanumeric characters,
minus ( - ) and underscore (_) in class or member names, and
must not accept parentheses, plus, vertical bar, percent
sign, asterisk, question mark, or white space. The use of
other characters is implementation-dependent.</p>

<p>STRUCTURES The component name patterns used to describe
the request are passed to XkbListComponents using an
XkbComponentNamesRec structure. This struc- ture has no
special allocation constraints or interrelationships with
other structures; allocate and free this structure using
standard mal- loc and free calls or their equivalent:</p>

<p>typedef struct _XkbComponentNames { char * keymap; /
keymap names */ char * keycodes; / keycode names */ char *
types; / type names */ char * compat; / compatibility map
names */ char * symbols; / symbol names */ char * geometry;
/ geometry names */ } XkbComponentNamesRec,
*XkbComponentNamesPtr;</p>

<p>XkbListComponents returns a pointer to an
XkbComponentListRec:</p>

<p>typedef struct _XkbComponentList { int num_keymaps; /
number of entries in keymap */ int num_keycodes; / number of
entries in keycodes */ int num_types; / number of entries in
types */ int num_compat; / number of entries in compat */
int num_symbols; / number of entries in symbols */ int
num_geometry; / number of entries in geometry;
XkbComponentNamePtr keymap; / keymap names */
XkbComponentNamePtr keycodes; / keycode names */
XkbComponentNamePtr types; / type names */
XkbComponentNamePtr compat; / compatibility map names */
XkbComponentNamePtr symbols; / symbol names */
XkbComponentNamePtr geometry; / geometry names */ }
XkbComponentListRec, *XkbComponentListPtr;</p>

<p>typedef struct _XkbComponentName { unsigned short flags;
/ hints regarding component name */ char * name; / name of
component */ } XkbComponentNameRec,
*XkbComponentNamePtr;</p>

<p>NOTES Note that the structure used to specify patterns
on input is an XkbCom- ponentNamesRec, and that used to hold
the individual component names upon return is an
XkbComponentNameRec (no trailing s in Name).</p>
