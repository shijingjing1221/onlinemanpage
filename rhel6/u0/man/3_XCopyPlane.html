<p>XCopyArea(3) XLIB FUNCTIONS XCopyArea(3)</p>

<p>NAME XCopyArea, XCopyPlane - copy areas</p>

<p>SYNTAX int XCopyArea(Display *display, Drawable src,
Drawable dest, GC gc, int src_x, int src_y, unsigned int
width, unsigned height, int dest_x, int dest_y);</p>

<p>int XCopyPlane(Display *display, Drawable src, Drawable
dest, GC gc, int src_x, int src_y, unsigned width, int
height, int dest_x, int dest_y, unsigned long plane);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS dest_x dest_y Specify the x and y coordinates,
which are relative to the origin of the destination
rectangle and specify its upper- left corner.</p>

<p>display Specifies the connection to the X server.</p>

<p>gc Specifies the GC.</p>

<p>plane Specifies the bit plane. You must set exactly one
bit to 1.</p>

<p>src dest Specify the source and destination rectangles
to be combined.</p>

<p>src_x src_y Specify the x and y coordinates, which are
relative to the origin of the source rectangle and specify
its upper-left corner.</p>

<p>width height Specify the width and height, which are the
dimensions of both the source and destination
rectangles.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The XCopyArea function combines the
specified rectangle of src with the specified rectangle of
dest. The drawables must have the same root and depth, or a
BadMatch error results.</p>

<p>If regions of the source rectangle are obscured and have
not been retained in backing store or if regions outside the
boundaries of the source drawable are specified, those
regions are not copied. Instead, the following occurs on all
corresponding destination regions that are either visible or
are retained in backing store. If the destination is a
window with a background other than None, corresponding
regions of the destination are tiled with that background
(with plane-mask of all ones and GXcopy function).
Regardless of tiling or whether the desti- nation is a
window or a pixmap, if graphics-exposures is True, then
GraphicsExpose events for all corresponding destination
regions are generated. If graphics-exposures is True but no
GraphicsExpose events are generated, a NoExpose event is
generated. Note that by default graphics-exposures is True
in new GCs.</p>

<p>This function uses these GC components: function,
plane-mask, subwin- dow-mode, graphics-exposures,
clip-x-origin, clip-y-origin, and clip- mask.</p>

<p>XCopyArea can generate BadDrawable, BadGC, and BadMatch
errors.</p>

<p>The XCopyPlane function uses a single bit plane of the
specified source rectangle combined with the specified GC to
modify the specified rect- angle of dest. The drawables must
have the same root but need not have the same depth. If the
drawables do not have the same root, a BadMatch error
results. If plane does not have exactly one bit set to 1 and
the value of plane is not less than %2 sup n%, where n is
the depth of src, a BadValue error results.</p>

<p>Effectively, XCopyPlane forms a pixmap of the same depth
as the rectan- gle of dest and with a size specified by the
source region. It uses the foreground/background pixels in
the GC (foreground everywhere the bit plane in src contains
a bit set to 1, background everywhere the bit plane in src
contains a bit set to 0) and the equivalent of a CopyArea
protocol request is performed with all the same exposure
semantics. This can also be thought of as using the
specified region of the source bit plane as a stipple with a
fill-style of FillOpaqueStippled for filling a rectangular
area of the destination.</p>

<p>This function uses these GC components: function,
plane-mask, fore- ground, background, subwindow-mode,
graphics-exposures, clip-x-origin, clip-y-origin, and
clip-mask.</p>

<p>XCopyPlane can generate BadDrawable, BadGC, BadMatch,
and BadValue errors.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS BadDrawable A value for a Drawable argument
does not name a defined Win- dow or Pixmap.</p>

<p>BadGC A value for a GContext argument does not name a
defined GCon- text.</p>

<p>BadMatch An InputOnly window is used as a Drawable.</p>

<p>BadMatch Some argument or pair of arguments has the
correct type and range but fails to match in some other way
required by the request.</p>

<p>BadValue Some numeric value falls outside the range of
values accepted by the request. Unless a specific range is
specified for an argument, the full range defined by the
argument s type is accepted. Any argument defined as a set
of alternatives can generate this error.</p>
