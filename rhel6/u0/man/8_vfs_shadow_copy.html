VFS_SHADOW_COPY(8)</p>

<p>NAME vfs_shadow_copy - Make a Samba share read only for
a specified time period</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS vfs objects = shadow_copy</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This VFS module is part of the samba(7)
suite.</p>

<p>The vfs_shadow_copy VFS module functionality that is
similar to Microsoft Shadow Copy services. When setup
properly, this module allows Microsoft Shadow Copy clients
to browse &quot;shadow copies&quot; on Samba shares.</p>

<p>This module is stackable.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION vfs_shadow_copy relies on a filesystem
snapshot implementation. Many common filesystems have native
support for this.</p>

<p>Filesystem snapshots must be mounted on specially named
directories in order to be recognized by vfs_shadow_copy.
The snapshot mount points must be immediate children of a
the directory being shared.</p>

<p>The snapshot naming convention is
@GMT-YYYY.MM.DD-hh.mm.ss, where:</p>

<p>&middot; YYYY is the 4 digit year</p>

<p>&middot; MM is the 2 digit month</p>

<p>&middot; DD is the 2 digit day</p>

<p>&middot; hh is the 2 digit hour</p>

<p>&middot; mm is the 2 digit minute</p>

<p>&middot; ss is the 2 digit second.</p>

<p>The vfs_shadow_copy snapshot naming convention can be
produced with the following date(1) command:</p>

<p>TZ=GMT date +@GMT-%Y.%m.%d-%H.%M.%S</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Add shadow copy support to user home
directories:</p>

<p>[homes] vfs objects = shadow_copy</p>

<p>CAVEATS This is not a backup, archival, or version
control solution.</p>

<p>With Samba or Windows servers, vfs_shadow_copy is
designed to be an end-user tool only. It does not replace or
enhance your backup and archival solutions and should in no
way be considered as such. Additionally, if you need version
control, implement a version control system.</p>

<p>VERSION This man page is correct for version 3.0.25 of
the Samba suite.</p>

<p>AUTHOR The original Samba software and related utilities
were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by
the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way
the Linux kernel is developed.</p>
