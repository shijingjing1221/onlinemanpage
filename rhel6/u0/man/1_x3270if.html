<p>NAME x3270if - command interface to x3270, c3270 and
s3270</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS x3270if [option]... [ action ] x3270if -i</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION x3270if provides an interface between
scripts and the 3270 emulators x3270, c3270, and s3270.</p>

<p>x3270if operates in one of two modes. In action mode, it
passes a sin- gle action and parameters to the emulator for
execution. The result of the action is written to standard
output, along with the (optional) status of the emulator.
(The action is optional as well, so that x3270if can just
reports the emulator status.) In iterative mode, it forms a
continuous conduit between a script and the emulator.</p>

<p>The action takes the form:</p>

<p>action-name(param[,param]...)</p>

<p>The parentheses are manatory, and usually must be quoted
when x3270if is called from a shell script.</p>

<p>If any param contains a space or comma, it must be
surrounded by double quotes.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -s field Causes x3270if to write to stdout the
value of one of the emula- tor status fields. Field is an
integer in the range 0 through 11. The value 0 is a no-op
and is used only to return exit sta- tus indicating the
state of the emulator. The indices 1-11 and meanings of each
field are documented on the x3270-script(1) manual page. If
an action is specified as well, the status field is written
after the output of the action, separated by a newline. The
-s option is mutually exclusive with the -S and -i
options.</p>

<p>-S Causes x3270if to write to stdout the value of all of
the emula- tor status fields. If an action is specified as
well, the sta- tus fields are written after the output of
the action, separated by a newline. The -S option is
mutually exclusive with the -s and -i options.</p>

<p>-i Puts x3270if in iterative mode. Data from x3270ifs
standard input is copied to the emulator s script input;
data from the emulator s script output is copied to x3270ifs
standard output. The -i option is mutually exclusive with
the -s and -S options. x3270if runs until it detects
end-of-file on its standard input or on the output from the
emulator. (This mode exists primarily to give expect(1) a
process to run, on systems which do not sup- port
bidirectional pipes.)</p>

<p>-p process-id Causes x3270if to use a Unix-domain socket
to connect to the emulator, rather than pipe file
descriptors given in environment variables. The emulator
must have been started with the -socket option.</p>

<p>-v Turns on verbose debug messages, showing on stderr
the literal data that is passed between the emulator and
x3270if.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS In action mode, if the requested action
succeeds, x3270if exits with status 0. If the action fails,
x3270if exits with status 1. In itera- tive mode, x3270if
exits with status 0 when it encounters end-of-file. If there
is an operational error within x3270if itself, such as a
com- mand-line syntax error, missing environment variable,
or an unexpect- edly closed pipe, x3270if exits with status
2.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT Unless the -socket option is given when they
are started, x3270, c3270, and s3270 use a pair of pipes for
communication with each child script process. The values of
the file descriptors for these pipes are encoded as text in
two environment variables, which are required by
x3270if:</p>

<p>X3270OUTPUT Output from the emulator, input to the child
process.</p>

<p>X3270INPUT Input to the emulator, output from the child
process.</p>
