<p>NAME ddbugtopbm - convert Diddle or DiddleBug sketches
to PBM files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ddbugtopbm</p>

<p>EXAMPLES ddbugtopbm
&lt;/path/to/palm/backup/dir/DiddleBugDB.pdb</p>

<p>ddbugtopbm &lt;/path/to/palm/backup/dir/DiddleDB.pdb</p>

<p>ddbugtopbm
&lt;/path/to/palm/backup/dir/DiddleIDB.pdb</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>ddbugtopbm converts all sketches present in a database
used by the Pal- mOS programs Diddle or DiddleBug into
appropriately-named PBM files. The backup copy of DiddleBugs
database you should use as this pro- grams input is usually
called DiddleBugDB.pdb. Or if you use the original Diddle,
it has two separate DBs - DiddleDB.pdb, containing unnamed
scratch sketches, and DiddleIDB.pdb, containing the saved
(and named) sketches which are listed by its index option.
You can feed this program any of these three on standard
input.</p>

<p>USING THE PROGRAM I recommend you not run ddbugtopbm
from your Palm backup directory, i.e. don t run it from the
directory the DB will normally be in. Instead, run it from
some other directory (perhaps you could make a directory
purely to hold the PBM files, just to keep things simple)
and use an absolute or relative path to the DB.</p>

<p>The filenames used for the output PBMs are based on the
names given to each sketch; if you have an unnamed sketch,
its given a name along the lines of sketch-0123.pbm.</p>

<p>While the named sketches will overwrite any existing PBM
file with the same name, the unnamed ones wont - theyll just
try using another filename. (I think this is probably the
right approach, as you cant really tell the unnamed sketches
apart.)</p>

<p>LIMITATIONS The DiddleBug DB reader is only known to
work with DBs from DiddleBug version 2.50. But it should
probably work on later versions, and I think itll work on
DBs from version 2.15 as well.</p>

<p>It might fall over if fed an empty database, and doesnt
do much (if any) checking of the input.</p>

<p>AUTHOR Russell Marks (rus@svgalib.org).</p>

<p>Mitch Blevins s decompression code is directly from
DiddleBug itself, which like ddbugtopbm is distributed under
the terms of the GNU GPL.</p>

<p>Jens-Chr. Heyers didcon script does something
similar.</p>

<p>HISTORY ddbugtopbm was new in Netpbm 10.18 (August
2003). It was written and independently distributed in
August 2002.</p>
