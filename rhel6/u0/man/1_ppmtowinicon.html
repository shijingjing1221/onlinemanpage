<p>NAME ppmtowinicon - convert PPM image into a Windows
.ico file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ppmtowinicon</p>

<p>[-andpgms]</p>

<p>[-output=output.ico]</p>

<p>[ppmfile [andfile] ...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>ppmtowinicon reads one or more PPM images as input and
produces a Microsoft Windows .ico file as output.</p>

<p>A Windows icon contains 1 or more images, at different
resolutions and color depths. When Windows wants to display
the icon, it searches through the images to find the one the
best matches the number of col- ors and resolution of the
display.</p>

<p>Microsoft recommends including at least the following
formats in each icon.</p>

<p>&middot; 16 x 16 - 4 bpp</p>

<p>&middot; 32 x 32 - 4 bpp</p>

<p>&middot; 48 x 48 - 8 bpp</p>

<p>If you don t specify any input files, input is from
Standard Input.</p>

<p>Output is to Standard Output unless you specify
-output.</p>

<p>Transparency If you specify the -andmask option, you get
(partly) transparent icons. In that case, your arguments are
pairs of file names, with the first file name being that of
the image and the second file name being that of a standard
Netpbm PGM transparency mask (see the pgmformatspecifica-
tion(1)).</p>

<p>In a .ico file, there is no such thing as partial
transparency (translucency). Where the PGM mask says
completely opaque, the icon will be opaque. Everywhere else,
the icon will be transparent. Note that as with any Netpbm
program, you can use a PBM image for the trans- parency mask
and ppmtowinicon will treat it like a PGM.</p>

<p>The and mask is like an alpha mask, except for what it
signifies in the &quot;not opaque&quot; areas. In the usual
case, the foreground image is black in those areas, and in
that case the areas are fully transparent -- the background
shows through the icon. But in general, a not opaque pixel
signifies that the background and foreground should be
merged as fol- lows: The intensities of the color components
in the forgeground and background are represented as binary
numbers, then corresponding bits of the background and
foreground intensities are exlusive-ored together. So there
is a sort of reverse video effect.</p>

<p>If you dont want this special effect and instead want
straightforward transparency, use the -truetransparent
option. This causes ppmtowini- con to make the base image
black everywhere your transparency mask says transparent,
regardless of what color you input image is at that loca-
tion.</p>

<p>If you dont specify -andmask, ppmtowinicon puts
all-opaque and masks into the .ico file.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -andpgms Include transparency information in the
icons. See the trans- parency section .</p>

<p>-output=output.ico Name of output file. By default,
ppmtowinicon writes the icon to Standard Output.</p>

<p>-truetransparent Make transparency in the icon normal
instead of the special reverse video effect. See the
transparency section .</p>
