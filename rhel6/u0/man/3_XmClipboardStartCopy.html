<p>NAME XmClipboardStartCopy A clipboard function that sets
up a storage and data structure</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;Xm/CutPaste.h&gt; int
XmClipboardStartCopy (display, window, clip_label,
timestamp, widget, callback, item_id) Display * display;
Window window; XmString clip_label; Time timestamp; Widget
widget; XmCutPasteProc callback; long * item_id; (void)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION XmClipboardStartCopy sets up storage and
data structures to receive clipboard data. An application
calls this function during a cut or copy operation. The data
item that these structures receive then becomes the next
data item in the clipboard.</p>

<p>Copying a large piece of data to the clipboard can take
a long time. It is possible that, once the data is copied,
no application will ever request that data. The Motif
Toolkit provides a mechanism so that an application does not
need to actually pass data to the clipboard until the data
has been requested by some application.</p>

<p>Instead, the application passes format and length
information in XmClipboardCopy to the clipboard functions,
along with a widget ID and a callback function address that
is passed in XmClipboardStartCopy. The widget ID is
necessary for communications between the clipboard func-
tions in the application that owns the data and the
clipboard functions in the application that requests the
data.</p>

<p>The callback functions are responsible for copying the
actual data to the clipboard through XmClipboardCopyByName.
The callback function is also called if the data item is
removed from the clipboard and the actual data is no longer
needed.</p>

<p>display Specifies a pointer to the Display structure
that was returned in a previous call to XOpenDisplay or
XtDisplay.</p>

<p>window Specifies the window ID of a widget that relates
the applica- tion window to the clipboard. The widgets
window ID can be obtained through XtWindow. The same
application instance should pass the same window ID to each
of the clipboard func- tions that it calls.</p>

<p>clip_label Specifies the label to be associated with the
data item. This argument is used to identify the data item,
as in a clipboard viewer. An example of a label is the name
of the application that places the data in the
clipboard.</p>

<p>timestamp Specifies the time of the event that triggered
the copy. A valid timestamp must be supplied; it is not
sufficient to use CurrentTime.</p>

<p>widget Specifies the ID of the widget that receives
messages requesting data previously passed by name. This
argument must be present in order to pass data by name. Any
valid widget ID in your application can be used for this
purpose and all the message handling is taken care of by the
cut and paste func- tions.</p>

<p>callback Specifies the address of the callback function
that is called when the clipboard needs data that was
originally passed by name. This is also the callback to
receive the delete message for items that were originally
passed by name. This argument must be present in order to
pass data by name.</p>

<p>item_id Specifies the number assigned to this data item.
The appli- cation uses this number in calls to
XmClipboardCopy, XmClip- boardEndCopy, and
XmClipboardCancelCopy.</p>

<p>For more information on passing data by name, see
XmClipboardCopy(3) and XmClipboardCopyByName(3).</p>

<p>The widget and callback arguments must be present in
order to pass data by name. The callback format is as
follows:</p>

<p>void (*callback) (widget, data_id, private, reason)
Widget widget; long *data_id; long *private; int *reason;
(void)</p>

<p>widget Specifies the ID of the widget passed to this
function.</p>

<p>data_id Specifies the identifying number returned by
XmClipboardCopy, which identifies the pass-by-name data.</p>

<p>private Specifies the private information passed to
XmClipboardCopy.</p>

<p>reason Specifies the reason. XmCR_CLIPBOARD_DATA_DELETE
or XmCR_CLIPBOARD_DATA_REQUEST are the possible values.</p>

<p>RETURN XmClipboardSuccess The function was
successful.</p>

<p>XmClipboardLocked The function failed because the
clipboard was locked by another application. The application
can continue to call the function again with the same
parameters until the lock goes away. This gives the
application the opportunity to ask if the user wants to keep
trying or to give up on the operation.</p>
