<p>NAME man - macros to format man pages</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS groff -Tascii -man file ...</p>

<p>groff -Tps -man file ...</p>

<p>man [section] title</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page explains the groff an.tmac
macro package (often called the man macro package). This
macro package should be used by develop- ers when writing or
porting man pages for Linux. It is fairly compati- ble with
other versions of this macro package, so porting man pages
should not be a major problem (exceptions include the NET-2
BSD release, which uses a totally different macro package
called mdoc; see mdoc(7)).</p>

<p>Note that NET-2 BSD mdoc man pages can be used with
groff simply by specifying the -mdoc option instead of the
-man option. Using the -mandoc option is, however,
recommended, since this will automatically detect which
macro package is in use.</p>

<p>For conventions that should be employed when writing man
pages for the Linux man-pages package, see man-pages(7).</p>

<p>Title line The first command in a man page (after
comment lines, that is, lines that start with .</p>

<p>.TH title section date source manual</p>

<p>For details of the arguments that should be supplied to
the TH command, see man-pages(7).</p>

<p>Note that BSD mdoc-formatted pages begin with the Dd
command, not the TH command.</p>

<p>Sections Sections are started with .SH followed by the
heading name.</p>

<p>The only mandatory heading is NAME, which should be the
first section and be followed on the next line by a one line
description of the pro- gram:</p>

<p>.SH NAME</p>

<p>It is extremely important that this format is followed,
and that there is a backslash before the single dash which
follows the command name. This syntax is used by the
makewhatis(8) program to create a database of short command
descriptions for the whatis(1) and apropos(1) com-
mands.</p>

<p>For a list of other sections that might appear in a
manual page, see man-pages(7).</p>

<p>Fonts The commands to select the type face are:</p>

<p>.B Bold</p>

<p>.BI Bold alternating with italics (especially useful for
function spec- ifications)</p>

<p>.BR Bold alternating with Roman (especially useful for
referring to other manual pages)</p>

<p>.I Italics</p>

<p>.IB Italics alternating with bold</p>

<p>.IR Italics alternating with Roman</p>

<p>.RB Roman alternating with bold</p>

<p>.RI Roman alternating with italics</p>

<p>.SB Small alternating with bold</p>

<p>.SM Small (useful for acronyms)</p>

<p>Traditionally, each command can have up to six
arguments, but the GNU implementation removes this
limitation (you might still want to limit yourself to 6
arguments for portability s sake). Arguments are delim- ited
by spaces. Double quotes can be used to specify an argument
which contains spaces. All of the arguments will be printed
next to each other without intervening spaces, so that the
.BR command can be used to specify a word in bold followed
by a mark of punctuation in Roman. If no arguments are
given, the command is applied to the following line of
text.</p>

<p>Other Macros and Strings Below are other relevant macros
and predefined strings. Unless noted otherwise, all macros
cause a break (end the current line of text). Many of these
macros set or use the &quot;prevailing indent.&quot; The
&quot;prevail- ing indent&quot; value is set by any macro
with the parameter i below; macros may omit i in which case
the current prevailing indent will be used. As a result,
successive indented paragraphs can use the same indent
without re-specifying the indent value. A normal
(non-indented) paragraph resets the prevailing indent value
to its default value (0.5 inches). By default a given indent
is measured in ens; try to use ens or ems as units for
indents, since these will automatically adjust to font size
changes. The other key macro definitions are:</p>

<p>Normal Paragraphs .LP Same as .PP (begin a new
paragraph).</p>

<p>.P Same as .PP (begin a new paragraph).</p>

<p>.PP Begin a new paragraph and reset prevailing
indent.</p>

<p>Relative Margin Indent .RS i Start relative margin
indent: moves the left margin i to the right (if i is
omitted, the prevailing indent value is used). A new
prevailing indent is set to 0.5 inches. As a result, all
following paragraph(s) will be indented until the corre-
sponding .RE.</p>

<p>.RE End relative margin indent and restores the previous
value of the prevailing indent.</p>

<p>Indented Paragraph Macros .HP i Begin paragraph with a
hanging indent (the first line of the paragraph is at the
left margin of normal paragraphs, and the rest of the
paragraphs lines are indented).</p>

<p>.IP x i Indented paragraph with optional hanging tag. If
the tag x is omitted, the entire following paragraph is
indented by i. If the tag x is provided, it is hung at the
left margin before the following indented paragraph (this is
just like .TP except the tag is included with the command
instead of being on the following line). If the tag is too
long, the text after the tag will be moved down to the next
line (text will not be lost or garbled). For bulleted lists,
use this macro with &bull; (bullet) or &mdash; (em dash) as
the tag, and for numbered lists, use the number or letter
followed by a period as the tag; this simplifies translation
to other formats.</p>

<p>.TP i Begin paragraph with hanging tag. The tag is given
on the next line, but its results are like those of the .IP
command.</p>

<p>Hypertext Link Macros (Feature supported with groff
only.) In order to use hypertext link macros, it is
necessary to load the www.tmac macro package. Use the
request .mso www.tmac to do this.</p>

<p>.URL url link trailer Inserts a hypertext link to the
URI (URL) url, with link as the text of the link. The
trailer will be printed immediately afterwards. When
generating HTML this should translate into the HTML command
&lt;A HREF=&quot;url&quot;&gt;link&lt;/A&gt;trailer.</p>

<p>This and other related macros are new, and many tools
wont do anything with them, but since many tools (including
troff) will simply ignore undefined macros (or at worst
insert their text) these are safe to insert.</p>

<p>It can be useful to define your own URL macro in manual
pages for the benefit of those viewing it with a roff viewer
other than groff. That way, the URL, link text, and trailer
text (if any) are still visible.</p>

<p>Heres an example: .de URL \$2 &lang;URL: \$1 &rang;\$3
.. .if 1 .mso www.tmac .TH ... (later in the page) This
software comes from the .URL &quot;http://www.gnu.org/&quot;
&quot;GNU Project&quot; &quot; of the&quot; .URL
&quot;http://www.fsf.org/&quot; &quot;Free Software
Foundation&quot; .</p>

<p>In the above, if groff is being used, the www.tmac macro
pack- ages definition of the URL macro will supersede the
locally defined one.</p>

<p>A number of other link macros are available. See
groff_www(7) for more details.</p>

<p>Miscellaneous Macros .DT Reset tabs to default tab
values (every 0.5 inches); does not cause a break.</p>

<p>.PD d Set inter-paragraph vertical distance to d (if
omitted, d=0.4v); does not cause a break.</p>

<p>.SS t Subheading t (like .SH, but used for a subsection
inside a section).</p>

<p>Predefined Strings The man package has the following
predefined strings:</p>

<p>Registration Symbol: &reg;</p>

<p>Change to default font size</p>

<p>Trademark Symbol:</p>

<p>Left angled double quote:</p>

<p>Right angled double quote:</p>

<p>Safe Subset Although technically man is a troff macro
package, in reality a large number of other tools process
man page files that dont implement all of troffs abilities.
Thus, its best to avoid some of troffs more exotic abilities
where possible to permit these other tools to work
correctly. Avoid using the various troff preprocessors (if
you must, go ahead and use tbl(1), but try to use the IP and
TP commands instead for two-column tables). Avoid using
computations; most other tools can t process them. Use
simple commands that are easy to translate to other formats.
The following troff macros are believed to be safe (though
in many cases they will be ignored by translators): bp, br,
ce, de, ds, el, ie, if, fi, ft, hy, ig, in, na, ne, nf, nh,
ps, so, sp, ti, tr.</p>

<p>You may also use many troff escape sequences (those
sequences beginning with . When you need to include the
backslash character as normal text, use \. Other sequences
you may use, where x or xx are any char- acters and N is any
digit, include,-,., (xx, $N, nx, n(xx, fx, and f(xx. Avoid
using the escape sequences for drawing graphics.</p>

<p>Do not use the optional parameter for bp (break page).
Use only posi- tive values for sp (vertical space). Don t
define a macro (de) with the same name as a macro in this or
the mdoc macro package with a dif- ferent meaning; its
likely that such redefinitions will be ignored. Every
positive indent (in) should be paired with a matching
negative indent (although you should be using the RS and RE
macros instead). The condition test (if,ie) should only have
&rsquo;t&rsquo; or &rsquo;n&rsquo; as the condi- tion. Only
translations (tr) that can be ignored should be used. Font
changes (ft and thef escape sequence) should only have the
values 1, 2, 3, 4, R, I, B, P, or CW (the ft command may
also have no parame- ters).</p>

<p>If you use capabilities beyond these, check the results
carefully on several tools. Once youve confirmed that the
additional capability is safe, let the maintainer of this
document know about the safe command or sequence that should
be added to this list.</p>

<p>FILES /usr/share/groff/[*/]tmac/an.tmac
/usr/man/whatis</p>

<p>NOTES By all means include full URLs (or URIs) in the
text itself; some tools such as man2html(1) can
automatically turn them into hypertext links. You can also
use the new URL macro to identify links to related infor-
mation. If you include URLs, use the full URL (e.g.,
&lt;http://www.ker- nelnotes.org&gt;) to ensure that tools
can automatically find the URLs.</p>

<p>Tools processing these files should open the file and
examine the first non-whitespace character. A period (.) or
single quote () at the beginning of a line indicates a
troff-based file (such as man or mdoc). A left angle bracket
(&lt;) indicates an SGML/XML-based file (such as HTML or
Docbook). Anything else suggests simple ASCII text (e.g., a
&quot;cat- man&quot; result).</p>

<p>Many man pages begin with &acute; ters, indicating how
the page is to be preprocessed. For portabilitys sake to
non-troff translators we recommend that you avoid using
anything other than tbl(1), and Linux can detect that
automatically. However, you might want to include this
information so your man page can be handled by other (less
capable) systems. Here are the defini- tions of the
preprocessors invoked by these characters:</p>

<p>e eqn(1)</p>

<p>g grap(1)</p>

<p>p pic(1)</p>

<p>r refer(1)</p>

<p>t tbl(1)</p>

<p>v vgrind(1)</p>

<p>BUGS Most of the macros describe formatting (e.g., font
type and spacing) instead of marking semantic content (e.g.,
this text is a reference to another page), compared to
formats like mdoc and DocBook (even HTML has more semantic
markings). This situation makes it harder to vary the man
format for different media, to make the formatting
consistent for a given media, and to automatically insert
cross-references. By sticking to the safe subset described
above, it should be easier to automate transitioning to a
different reference page format in the future.</p>
