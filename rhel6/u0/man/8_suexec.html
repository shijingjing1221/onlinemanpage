<p>NAME suexec - Switch user before executing external
programs</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS suexec -V</p>

<p>SUMMARY suexec is used by the Apache HTTP Server to
switch to another user before executing CGI programs. In
order to achieve this, it must run as root. Since the HTTP
daemon normally doesn t run as root, the suexec executable
needs the setuid bit set and must be owned by root. It
should never be writable for any other person than root.</p>

<p>For further information about the concepts and and the
security model of suexec please refer to the suexec
documentation
(http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/suexec.html).</p>

<p>OPTIONS -V If you are root, this option displays the
compile options of suexec. For security reasons all
configuration options are changeable only at compile
time.</p>
