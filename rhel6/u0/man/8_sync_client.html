<p>NAME sync_client - client side of the synchronization
(replication) engine</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sync_client [ -v ] [ -l ] [ -z ] [ -C
config-file ] [ -S servername ] [ -f input-file ] [ -F
shutdown_file ] [ -w wait_interval ] [ -t timeout ] [ -d
delay ] [ -r ] [ -u ] [ -m ] [ -s ] objects...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Sync_client is the client side of the
replication system. It runs on the client (master) system
and connects to the target (replica) system and generates an
appropriate sequence of transactions to synchronize the
replica system with the master system.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -v Verbose mode.</p>

<p>-l Verbose logging mode.</p>

<p>-o Only attempt to connect to the backend server once
rather than waiting up to 1000 seconds before giving up.</p>

<p>-z Enable compress. If you set sync_compress in the
imapd.conf or pass -z to sync_client, the replication
protocol will attempt to enable deflate compression on the
connection.</p>

<p>-C config-file Read configuration options from
config-file.</p>

<p>-S servername Tells sync_client which server to
communicate with. Overrides the sync_host configuration
option.</p>

<p>-f input-file In mailbox or user replication mode:
provides list of users or mailboxes to replicate. In rolling
replication mode, specifies an alternate log file
(sync_client will exit after processing the log file).</p>

<p>-F shutdown-file Rolling replication checks for this
file at the end of each replication cycle and shuts down if
it is present. Used to request nice clean shutdown at first
convenient point. The file in question is removed on
shutdown. Overrides sync_shut- down_file option in
imapd.conf</p>

<p>-w interval Wait this long before starting. Typically
used so that we can attach a debugger to one end of the
replication system or the other.</p>

<p>-t timeout Timeout for single replication run in rolling
replication. sync_client will negotiate a restart after this
many seconds. Default: 600 seconds</p>

<p>-d delay Minimum delay between replication runs in
rolling replication mode. Larger values provide better
efficiency as transactions can be merged. Smaller values
mean that the replica system is more up to date and that you
dont end up with large blocks of replication transactions as
a single group. Default: 3 seconds.</p>

<p>-r Rolling (repeat) replication mode. Pick up a list of
actions recorded by the lmtpd(8), imapd(8), popd(8) and
nntpd(8) daemons from the file specified in sync_log_file.
Repeat until sync_shutdwon_file appears.</p>

<p>-u User mode. Remaining arguments are list of users who
should be replicated.</p>

<p>-m Mailbox mode. Remaining arguments are list of
mailboxes which should be replicated.</p>

<p>-s Sieve mode. Remaining arguments are list of users
whose Sieve files should be replicated. Principally used for
debugging pur- poses: not exposed to sync_client(8).</p>

<p>FILES /etc/imapd.conf</p>
