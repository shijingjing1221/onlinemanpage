<p>SIGSUSPEND(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
SIGSUSPEND(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME sigsuspend - wait for a signal</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;signal.h&gt;</p>

<p>int sigsuspend(const sigset_t *sigmask);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sigsuspend() function shall replace the
current signal mask of the calling thread with the set of
signals pointed to by sigmask and then suspend the thread
until delivery of a signal whose action is either to execute
a signal-catching function or to terminate the process. This
shall not cause any other signals that may have been pending
on the process to become pending on the thread.</p>

<p>If the action is to terminate the process then
sigsuspend() shall never return. If the action is to execute
a signal-catching function, then sigsuspend() shall return
after the signal-catching function returns, with the signal
mask restored to the set that existed prior to the sig-
suspend() call.</p>

<p>It is not possible to block signals that cannot be
ignored. This is enforced by the system without causing an
error to be indicated.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Since sigsuspend() suspends thread
execution indefinitely, there is no successful completion
return value. If a return occurs, -1 shall be returned and
errno set to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The sigsuspend() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EINTR A signal is caught by the calling process and
control is returned from the signal-catching function.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE Normally, at the beginning of a
critical code section, a specified set of signals is blocked
using the sigprocmask() function. When the thread has
completed the critical section and needs to wait for the
previously blocked signal(s), it pauses by calling
sigsuspend() with the mask that was returned by the
sigprocmask() call.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
