<p>NAME bounce - Postfix bounce message template format</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS bounce_template_file =
/etc/postfix/bounce.cf</p>

<p>postconf -b [template_file]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The Postfix bounce(8) server produces
delivery status notification (DSN) messages for
undeliverable mail, delayed mail, successful deliv- ery or
address verification requests.</p>

<p>By default, these notifications are generated from
built-in templates with message headers and message text.
Sites can override the built-in information by specifying a
bounce template file with the bounce_tem- plate_file
configuration parameter.</p>

<p>This document describes the general procedure to create
a bounce tem- plate file, followed by the specific details
of bounce template for- mats.</p>

<p>GENERAL PROCEDURE To create a customized bounce template
file, create a temporary copy of the file
/usr/share/doc/postfix-2.6.6/bounce.cf.default and edit the
temporary file.</p>

<p>To preview the results of $name expansions in the
template text, use the command</p>

<p>postconf -b temporary_file</p>

<p>Errors in the template will be reported to the standard
error stream and to the syslog daemon.</p>

<p>While previewing the text, be sure to pay particular
attention to the expansion of time value parameters that
appear in the delayed mail notification text.</p>

<p>Once the result is satisfactory, copy the template to
the Postfix con- figuration directory and specify in main.cf
something like:</p>

<p>/etc/postfix/main.cf: bounce_template_file =
/etc/postfix/bounce.cf</p>

<p>TEMPLATE FILE FORMAT The template file can specify
templates for failed mail, delayed mail, successful delivery
or for address verification. These templates are named
failure_template, delay_template, success_template and ver-
ify_template, respectively. You can but do not have to
specify all four templates in a bounce template file.</p>

<p>Each template starts with &quot;template_name =
&lt;&lt;EOF&quot; and ends with a line that contains the
word &quot;EOF&quot; only. You can change the word EOF, but
you can t enclose it in quotes as with the shell or with
Perl (tem- plate_name = &lt;EO). Here is an example:</p>

<p># The failure template is used for undeliverable
mail.</p>

<p>failure_template = &lt;&lt;EOF Charset: us-ascii From:
MAILER-DAEMON (Mail Delivery System) Subject: Undelivered
Mail Returned to Sender Postmaster-Subject: Postmaster Copy:
Undelivered Mail</p>

<p>This is the mail system at host $myhostname.</p>

<p>Im sorry to have to inform you that your message could
not be delivered to one or more recipients. It s attached
below.</p>

<p>For further assistance, please send mail to
postmaster.</p>

<p>If you do so, please include this problem report. You
can delete your own text from the attached returned
message.</p>

<p>The mail system EOF</p>

<p>The usage and specification of bounce templates is
subject to the fol- lowing restrictions:</p>

<p>&middot; No special meaning is given to the backslash
character or to leading whitespace; these are always taken
literally.</p>

<p>&middot; Inside the &lt;&lt; context, the &quot;$&quot;
character is special. To produce a &quot;$&quot; character
as output, specify &quot;$$&quot;.</p>

<p>&middot; Outside the &lt;&lt; context, lines beginning
with &quot;#&quot; are ignored, as are empty lines, and
lines consisting of whitespace only.</p>

<p>Examples of all templates can be found in the file
bounce.cf.default in the Postfix configuration
directory.</p>

<p>TEMPLATE HEADER FORMAT The first portion of a bounce
template consists of optional template headers. Some become
message headers in the delivery status notifica- tion; some
control the formatting of that notification. Headers not
specified in a template will be left at their default
value.</p>

<p>The following headers are supported:</p>

<p>Charset: The MIME character set of the template message
text. See the &quot;TEMPLATE MESSAGE TEXT FORMAT&quot;
description below.</p>

<p>From: The sender address in the message header of the
delivery status notification.</p>

<p>Subject: The subject in the message header of the
delivery status notifi- cation that is returned to the
sender.</p>

<p>Postmaster-Subject: The subject that will be used in
Postmaster copies of undeliver- able or delayed mail
notifications. These copies are sent under control of the
notify_classes configuration parameter.</p>

<p>The usage and specification of template message headers
is subject to the following restrictions:</p>

<p>&middot; Template message header names can be specified
in upper case, lower case or mixed case. Postfix always
produces bounce message header labels of the form
&quot;From:&quot; and &quot;Subject:&quot;.</p>

<p>&middot; Template message headers must not span multiple
lines.</p>

<p>&middot; Template message headers do not support
$parameter expansions.</p>

<p>&middot; Template message headers must contain ASCII
characters only, and must not contain ASCII null
characters.</p>

<p>TEMPLATE MESSAGE TEXT FORMAT The second portion of a
bounce template consists of message text. As the above
example shows, template message text may contain main.cf
$parameters. Besides the parameters that are defined in
main.cf, the following parameters are treated specially
depending on the suffix that is appended to their name.</p>

<p>delay_warning_time_suffix Expands into the value of the
delay_warning_time parameter, expressed in the time unit
specified by suffix, which is one of seconds, minutes,
hours, days, or weeks.</p>

<p>maximal_queue_lifetime_suffix Expands into the value of
the maximal_queue_lifetime parameter, expressed in the time
unit specified by suffix. See above under delay_warning_time
for possible suffix values.</p>

<p>The usage and specification of template message text is
subject to the following restrictions:</p>

<p>&middot; The template message text is not sent in
Postmaster copies of delivery status notifications.</p>

<p>&middot; If the template message text contains non-ASCII
characters, Postfix requires that the Charset: template
header is updated. Specify an appropriate superset of
US-ASCII. A superset is needed because Postfix appends ASCII
text after the message tem- plate when it sends a delivery
status notification.</p>

notifications postconf(5), configuration parameters</p>
