<p>NAME dumpcap - Dump network traffic</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS dumpcap [ -a &lt;capture autostop condition&gt;
] ... [ -b &lt;capture ring buffer option&gt;] ... [ -B
&lt;capture buffer size (Win32 only)&gt; ] [ -c &lt;capture
packet count&gt; ] [ -D ] [ -f &lt;capture filter&gt; ] [ -h
] [ -i &lt;capture interface&gt;|- ] [ -L ] [ -n ] [ -M ] [
-p ] [ -s &lt;capture snaplen&gt; ] [ -S ] [ -v ] [ -w
&lt;outfile&gt; ] [ -y &lt;capture link type&gt; ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Dumpcap is a network traffic dump tool. It
lets you capture packet data from a live network and write
the packets to a file. Dumpcaps native capture file format
is libpcap format, which is also the format used by
Wireshark, tcpdump and various other tools. When the -n
option is specified, the output file is written in the new
pcapng format.</p>

<p>Without any options set it will use the pcap library to
capture traffic from the first available network interface
and writes the received raw packet data, along with the
packets time stamps into a libpcap file.</p>

<p>If the -w option is not specified, Dumpcap writes to a
newly created libpcap file with a randomly chosen name. If
the -w option is specified, Dumpcap writes to the file
specified by that option.</p>

<p>Packet capturing is performed with the pcap library. The
capture filter syntax follows the rules of the pcap
library.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -a &lt;capture autostop condition&gt; Specify a
criterion that specifies when Dumpcap is to stop writing to
a capture file. The criterion is of the form test:value,
where test is one of:</p>

<p>duration:value Stop writing to a capture file after
value seconds have elapsed.</p>

<p>filesize:value Stop writing to a capture file after it
reaches a size of value kilobytes (where a kilobyte is 1024
bytes). If this option is used together with the -b option,
dumpcap will stop writing to the current capture file and
switch to the next one if filesize is reached.</p>

<p>files:value Stop writing to capture files after value
number of files were written.</p>

<p>-b &lt;capture ring buffer option&gt; Cause Dumpcap to
run in &quot;multiple files&quot; mode. In &quot;multiple
files&quot; mode, Dumpcap will write to several capture
files. When the first capture file fills up, Dumpcap will
switch writing to the next file and so on.</p>

<p>The created filenames are based on the filename given
with the -w option, the number of the file and on the
creation date and time, e.g.
outfile_00001_20050604120117.pcap,
outfile_00001_20050604120523.pcap, ...</p>

<p>With the files option its also possible to form a
&quot;ring buffer&quot;. This will fill up new files until
the number of files specified, at which point Dumpcap will
discard the data in the first file and start writing to that
file and so on. If the files option is not set, new files
filled up until one of the capture stop conditions match (or
until the disk if full).</p>

<p>The criterion is of the form key:value, where key is one
of:</p>

<p>duration:value switch to the next file after value
seconds have elapsed, even if the current file is not
completely filled up.</p>

<p>filesize:value switch to the next file after it reaches
a size of value kilobytes (where a kilobyte is 1024
bytes).</p>

<p>files:value begin again with the first file after value
number of files were written (form a ring buffer).</p>

<p>-B &lt;capture buffer size (Win32 only)&gt; Win32 only:
set capture buffer size (in MB, default is 1MB). This is
used by the the capture driver to buffer packet data until
that data can be written to disk. If you encounter packet
drops while capturing, try to increase this size.</p>

<p>-c &lt;capture packet count&gt; Set the maximum number
of packets to read when capturing live data.</p>

<p>-D Print a list of the interfaces on which Dumpcap can
capture, and exit. For each network interface, a number and
an interface name, possibly followed by a text description
of the interface, is printed. The interface name or the
number can be supplied to the -i option to specify an
interface on which to capture.</p>

<p>This can be useful on systems that dont have a command
to list them (e.g., Windows systems, or UNIX systems lacking
ifconfig -a); the number can be useful on Windows 2000 and
later systems, where the interface name is a somewhat
complex string.</p>

<p>Note that &quot;can capture&quot; means that Dumpcap was
able to open that device to do a live capture. Depending on
your system you may need to run dumpcap from an account with
special privileges (for example, as root) to be able to
capture network traffic. If &quot;dumpcap -D&quot; is not
run from such an account, it will not list any
interfaces.</p>

<p>-f &lt;capture filter&gt; Set the capture filter
expression.</p>

<p>The entire filter expression must be specified as a
single argument (which means that if it contains spaces, it
must be quoted).</p>

<p>-h Print the version and options and exits.</p>

<p>-i &lt;capture interface&gt;|- Set the name of the
network interface or pipe to use for live packet
capture.</p>

<p>Network interface names should match one of the names
listed in &quot;dumpcap -D&quot; (described above); a
number, as reported by &quot;dumpcap -D&quot;, can also be
used. If youre using UNIX, &quot;netstat -i&quot; or
&quot;ifconfig -a&quot; might also work to list interface
names, although not all versions of UNIX support the -a
option to ifconfig.</p>

<p>If no interface is specified, Dumpcap searches the list
of interfaces, choosing the first non-loopback interface if
there are any non-loopback interfaces, and choosing the
first loopback interface if there are no non-loopback
interfaces. If there are no interfaces at all, Dumpcap
reports an error and doesnt start the capture.</p>

<p>Pipe names should be either the name of a FIFO (named
pipe) or - to read data from the standard input. Data read
from pipes must be in standard libpcap format.</p>

<p>Note: the Win32 version of Dumpcap doesn t support
capturing from pipes or stdin!</p>

<p>-L List the data link types supported by the interface
and exit. The reported link types can be used for the -y
option.</p>

<p>-M When used with -D, -L and -S, print verbose,
machine-readable output.</p>

<p>-n Write the output file in the pcapng format instead of
the default pcap format.</p>

<p>-p Dont put the interface into promiscuous mode. Note
that the interface might be in promiscuous mode for some
other reason; hence, -p cannot be used to ensure that the
only traffic that is captured is traffic sent to or from the
machine on which Dumpcap is running, broadcast traffic, and
multicast traffic to addresses received by that machine.</p>

<p>-s &lt;capture snaplen&gt; Set the default snapshot
length to use when capturing live data. No more than snaplen
bytes of each network packet will be read into memory, or
saved to disk. A value of 0 specifies a snapshot length of
65535, so that the full packet is captured; this is the
default.</p>

<p>-S Print statistics for each interface once every
second.</p>

<p>-v Print the version and exit.</p>

<p>-w &lt;outfile&gt; Write raw packet data to outfile.</p>

<p>NOTE: The usage of &quot;-&quot; for stdout is not
allowed here!</p>

<p>-y &lt;capture link type&gt; Set the data link type to
use while capturing packets. The values reported by -L are
the values that can be used.</p>
