<p>TTYNAME(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual TTYNAME(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME ttyname, ttyname_r - find the pathname of a
terminal</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>char *ttyname(int fildes);</p>

<p>int ttyname_r(int fildes, char *name, size_t
namesize);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The ttyname() function shall return a
pointer to a string containing a null-terminated pathname of
the terminal associated with file descrip- tor fildes. The
return value may point to static data whose content is
overwritten by each call.</p>

<p>The ttyname() function need not be reentrant. A function
that is not required to be reentrant is not required to be
thread-safe.</p>

<p>The ttyname_r() function shall store the null-terminated
pathname of the terminal associated with the file descriptor
fildes in the charac- ter array referenced by name. The
array is namesize characters long and should have space for
the name and the terminating null character. The maximum
length of the terminal name shall be {TTY_NAME_MAX}.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, ttyname() shall
return a pointer to a string. Otherwise, a null pointer
shall be returned and errno set to indicate the error.</p>

<p>If successful, the ttyname_r() function shall return
zero. Otherwise, an error number shall be returned to
indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The ttyname() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EBADF The fildes argument is not a valid file
descriptor.</p>

<p>ENOTTY The fildes argument does not refer to a
terminal.</p>

<p>The ttyname_r() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EBADF The fildes argument is not a valid file
descriptor.</p>

<p>ENOTTY The fildes argument does not refer to a
terminal.</p>

<p>ERANGE The value of namesize is smaller than the length
of the string to be returned including the terminating null
character.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The term terminal is used instead of the
historical term terminal device in order to avoid a
reference to an undefined term.</p>

<p>The thread-safe version places the terminal name in a
user-supplied buffer and returns a non-zero value if it
fails. The non-thread-safe version may return the name in a
static data area that may be overwrit- ten by each call.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
