<p>LOCALTIME(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
LOCALTIME(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME localtime, localtime_r - convert a time value to a
broken-down local time</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;time.h&gt;</p>

<p>struct tm *localtime(const time_t *timer);</p>

<p>struct tm *localtime_r(const time_t *restrict timer,
struct tm *restrict result);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION For localtime(): The functionality described
on this reference page is aligned with the ISO C standard.
Any conflict between the require- ments described here and
the ISO C standard is unintentional. This vol- ume of IEEE
Std 1003.1-2001 defers to the ISO C standard.</p>

<p>The localtime() function shall convert the time in
seconds since the Epoch pointed to by timer into a
broken-down time, expressed as a local time. The function
corrects for the timezone and any seasonal time adjustments.
Local timezone information is used as though localtime()
calls tzset().</p>

<p>The relationship between a time in seconds since the
Epoch used as an argument to localtime() and the tm
structure (defined in the &lt;time.h&gt; header) is that the
result shall be as specified in the expression given in the
definition of seconds since the Epoch (see the Base Defi-
nitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 4.14,
Seconds Since the Epoch) corrected for timezone and any
seasonal time adjustments, where the names in the structure
and in the expression correspond.</p>

<p>The same relationship shall apply for localtime_r().</p>

<p>The localtime() function need not be reentrant. A
function that is not required to be reentrant is not
required to be thread-safe.</p>

<p>The asctime(), ctime(), gmtime(), and localtime()
functions shall return values in one of two static objects:
a broken-down time struc- ture and an array of type char.
Execution of any of the functions may overwrite the
information returned in either of these objects by any of
the other functions.</p>

<p>The localtime_r() function shall convert the time in
seconds since the Epoch pointed to by timer into a
broken-down time stored in the struc- ture to which result
points. The localtime_r() function shall also return a
pointer to that same structure.</p>

<p>Unlike localtime(), the reentrant version is not
required to set tzname.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, the localtime()
function shall return a pointer to the broken-down time
structure. If an error is detected, localtime() shall return
a null pointer and set errno to indicate the error.</p>

<p>Upon successful completion, localtime_r() shall return a
pointer to the structure pointed to by the argument
result.</p>

<p>ERRORS The localtime() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EOVERFLOW The result cannot be represented.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Getting the Local Date and Time The following
example uses the time() function to calculate the time
elapsed, in seconds, since January 1, 1970 0:00 UTC (the
Epoch), local- time() to convert that value to a broken-down
time, and asctime() to convert the broken-down time values
into a printable string.</p>

<p>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; #include &lt;time.h&gt;</p>

<p>int main(void) { time_t result;</p>

<p>result = time(NULL); printf(&quot;%s%ju secs since the
Epocn&quot;, asctime(localtime(&amp;result)),
(uintmax_t)result); return(0); }</p>

<p>This example writes the current time to stdout in a form
like this:</p>

<p>Wed Jun 26 10:32:15 1996 835810335 secs since the
Epoch</p>

<p>Getting the Modification Time for a File The following
example gets the modification time for a file. The local-
time() function converts the time_t value of the last
modification date, obtained by a previous call to stat(),
into a tm structure that contains the year, month, day, and
so on.</p>

<p>#include &lt;time.h&gt; ... struct stat statbuf; ... tm
= localtime(&amp;statbuf.st_mtime); ...</p>

<p>Timing an Event The following example gets the current
time, converts it to a string using localtime() and
asctime(), and prints it to standard output using fputs().
It then prints the number of minutes to an event being
timed.</p>

<p>#include &lt;time.h&gt; #include &lt;stdio.h&gt; ...
time_t now; int minutes_to_event; ... time(&amp;now);
printf(&quot;The time is &quot;);
fputs(asctime(localtime(&amp;now)), stdout);
printf(&quot;There are still %d minutes to the eventn&quot;,
minutes_to_event); ...</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The localtime_r() function is
thread-safe and returns values in a user- supplied buffer
instead of possibly using a static data area that may be
overwritten by each call.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
