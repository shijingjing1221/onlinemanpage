<p>NAME networks - network name information</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The file /etc/networks is a plain ASCII file
that describes known DARPA networks and symbolic names for
these networks. Each line represents a network and has the
following structure:</p>

<p>name number aliases ...</p>

<p>where the fields are delimited by spaces or tabs. Empty
lines are ignored. The hash character (#) indicates the
start of a comment: this character, and the remaining
characters up to the end of the current line, are ignored by
library functions that process the file.</p>

<p>The field descriptions are:</p>

<p>name The symbolic name for the network. Network names
can contain any printable characters execept white-space
characters or the comment character.</p>

<p>number The official number for this network in
numbers-and-dots nota- tion (see inet(3)). The trailing
&quot;.0&quot; (for the host component of the network
address) may be omitted.</p>

<p>aliases Optional aliases for the network.</p>

<p>This file is read by the route(8) and netstat(8)
utilities. Only Class A, B or C networks are supported,
partitioned networks (i.e., net- work/26 or network/28) are
not supported by this facility.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/networks The networks definition file.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO getnetbyaddr(3), getnetbyname(3), getnetent(3),
