<p>console.handlers(5) System Administrator s Manual
console.handlers(5)</p>

<p>NAME console.handlers - file specifying handlers of
console lock and unlock events</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION /etc/security/console.handlers determines
which programs will be run when an user obtains the console
lock at login time, and when the user loses it on log out.
It is read by the pam_console module.</p>

<p>The format is:</p>

<p>handler-filename lock|unlock [flag ...]</p>

<p>Where handler-filename is a name of the executable to be
run, lock or unlock specifies on which event it should be
run, and flags specify how should pam_console call it.</p>

<p>Additionally there should be a line which specifies glob
patterns of console devices.</p>

<p>The format of this line is: console-name consoledevs
regex [regex ...]</p>

<p>Where console-name is a name of the console class -
currently ignored - and regexes are regular expression
patterns which specify the name of the tty device. Only the
first such line is consulted.</p>

<p>FLAGS logfail The pam_console module should log error to
the system log if the return value of the handler is not
zero or if the handler can not be executed.</p>

<p>wait The pam_console should wait for the handler to exit
before con- tinuing.</p>

<p>setuid The handler should be executed with uid/gid of
the user which obtained the console lock.</p>

<p>tty The handler will get a tty name as obtained from PAM
as a param- eter.</p>

<p>user The handler will get an user name as obtained from
PAM as a parameter.</p>

<p>Anything else will be added directly as a parameter to
the handler exe- cutable.</p>
