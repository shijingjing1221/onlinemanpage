<p>ENDGRENT(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual ENDGRENT(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME endgrent, getgrent, setgrent - group database entry
functions</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;grp.h&gt;</p>

<p>void endgrent(void); struct group *getgrent(void); void
setgrent(void);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The getgrent() function shall return a
pointer to a structure contain- ing the broken-out fields of
an entry in the group database. When first called,
getgrent() shall return a pointer to a group structure
contain- ing the first entry in the group database.
Thereafter, it shall return a pointer to a group structure
containing the next group structure in the group database,
so successive calls may be used to search the entire
database.</p>

<p>An implementation that provides extended security
controls may impose further implementation-defined
restrictions on accessing the group database. In particular,
the system may deny the existence of some or all of the
group database entries associated with groups other than
those groups associated with the caller and may omit users
other than the caller from the list of members of groups in
database entries that are returned.</p>

<p>The setgrent() function shall rewind the group database
to allow repeated searches.</p>

<p>The endgrent() function may be called to close the group
database when processing is complete.</p>

<p>These functions need not be reentrant. A function that
is not required to be reentrant is not required to be
thread-safe.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE When first called, getgrent() shall return
a pointer to the first group structure in the group
database. Upon subsequent calls it shall return the next
group structure in the group database. The getgrent() func-
tion shall return a null pointer on end-of-file or an error
and errno may be set to indicate the error.</p>

<p>The return value may point to a static area which is
overwritten by a subsequent call to getgrgid(), getgrnam(),
or getgrent().</p>

<p>ERRORS The getgrent() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EINTR A signal was caught during the operation.</p>

<p>EIO An I/O error has occurred.</p>

<p>EMFILE {OPEN_MAX} file descriptors are currently open in
the calling process.</p>

<p>ENFILE The maximum allowable number of files is
currently open in the system.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE These functions are provided due to
their historical usage. Applica- tions should avoid
dependencies on fields in the group database, whether the
database is a single file, or where in the file system name
space the database resides. Applications should use
getgrnam() and get- grgid() whenever possible because it
avoids these dependencies.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
