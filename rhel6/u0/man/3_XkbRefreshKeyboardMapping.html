<p>XkbRefreshKeyboardMapping(3) XKB FUNCTIONS
XkbRefreshKeyboardMapping(3)</p>

<p>NAME XkbRefreshKeyboardMapping - Update the keyboard
description that is internal to the X library</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS Status XkbRefreshKeyboardMapping
(XkbMapNotifyEvent *event);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS - event event initiating remapping</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION XkbRefreshKeyboardMapping is the Xkb
equivalent of the core XRe- freshKeyboardMapping function.
It requests that the X server send the current key mapping
information to this client. A client usually invokes
XkbRefreshKeyboardMapping after receiving an XkbMapNotify
event. XkbRefreshKeyboardMapping returns Success if it
succeeds and BadMatch if the event is not an Xkb event.</p>

<p>The XkbMapNotify event can be generated when some client
calls Xkb- SetMap, XkbChangeMap, XkbGetKeyboardByName, or
any of the standard X library functions that change the
keyboard mapping or modifier mapping.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUES Success The XkbRefreshKeyboardMapping
function returns Success when the request that the X server
send the current key mapping information to this client is
successful.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS BadMatch A compatible version of Xkb was not
available in the server or an argument has correct type and
range, but is otherwise invalid</p>
