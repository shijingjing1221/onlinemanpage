<p>FREAD(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual FREAD(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME fread - binary input</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</p>

<p>size_t fread(void *restrict ptr, size_t size, size_t
nitems, FILE *restrict stream);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The fread() function shall read into the
array pointed to by ptr up to nitems elements whose size is
specified by size in bytes, from the stream pointed to by
stream. For each object, size calls shall be made to the
fgetc() function and the results stored, in the order read,
in an array of unsigned char exactly overlaying the object.
The file posi- tion indicator for the stream (if defined)
shall be advanced by the number of bytes successfully read.
If an error occurs, the resulting value of the file position
indicator for the stream is unspecified. If a partial
element is read, its value is unspecified.</p>

<p>The fread() function may mark the st_atime field of the
file associated with stream for update. The st_atime field
shall be marked for update by the first successful execution
of fgetc(), fgets(), fgetwc(), fgetws(), fread(), fscanf(),
getc(), getchar(), gets(), or scanf() using stream that
returns data not supplied by a prior call to ungetc() or
ungetwc().</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, fread() shall
return the number of elements successfully read which is
less than nitems only if a read error or end-of-file is
encountered. If size or nitems is 0, fread() shall return 0
and the contents of the array and the state of the stream
remain unchanged. Otherwise, if a read error occurs, the
error indica- tor for the stream shall be set, and errno
shall be set to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS Refer to fgetc().</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Reading from a Stream The following example
reads a single element from the fp stream into the array
pointed to by buf.</p>

<p>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; ... size_t bytes_read; char
buf[100]; FILE *fp; ... bytes_read = fread(buf, sizeof(buf),
1, fp); ...</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The ferror() or feof() functions must
be used to distinguish between an error condition and an
end-of-file condition.</p>

<p>Because of possible differences in element length and
byte ordering, files written using fwrite() are
application-dependent, and possibly cannot be read using
fread() by a different application or by the same
application on a different processor.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
