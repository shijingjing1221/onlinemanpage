<p>NAME mrtg-mibhelp - A Table of some interesting OIDs</p>

<p>OVERVIEW This File Contains a collection of interesting
MIB Entries ... mrtg knows about their names ... depending
on the ASN.1 Syntax you may have to put gauge into the
Options[]: parameter.</p>

<p>For information about how to create a Target[]:
parameter which refer- ences these MIB entries, please
consult mrtg-reference.</p>

<p>MIB LIST ifOperStatus</p>

<p>Descriptor: ifOperStatus Identifier: 1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.8
ASN.1 Syntax: INTEGER Enumeration: up 1, down 2, testing
3</p>

<p>The current operational state of the interface. The
testing(3) state indicates that no operational packets can
be passed.</p>

<p>ifAdminStatus</p>

<p>Descriptor: ifAdminStatus Identifier:
1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.7 ASN.1 Syntax: INTEGER Enumeration: up 1,
down 2, testing 3</p>

<p>The current administrative state of the interface. The
testing(3) state indicates that no operational packets can
be passed.</p>

<p>ifInOctets</p>

<p>Descriptor: ifInOctets Identifier: 1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.10
ASN.1 Syntax: Counter32</p>

<p>The total number of octets received on the interface,
including framing characters.</p>

<p>ifInUcastPkts</p>

<p>Descriptor: ifInUcastPkts Identifier:
1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.11 ASN.1 Syntax: Counter32</p>

<p>The number of subnetwork-unicast packets delivered to a
higher-layer protocol.</p>

<p>ifInNUcastPkts</p>

<p>Descriptor: ifInNUcastPkts Identifier:
1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.12 ASN.1 Syntax: Counter32</p>

<p>The number of non-unicast (i.e., subnetwork- broadcast
or subnet- work-multicast) packets delivered to a
higher-layer protocol.</p>

<p>ifInDiscards</p>

<p>Descriptor: ifInDiscards Identifier:
1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.13 ASN.1 Syntax: Counter32</p>

<p>The number of inbound packets which were chosen to be
discarded even though no errors had been detected to prevent
their being deliverable to a higher-layer protocol. One
possible reason for discarding such a packet could be to
free up buffer space.</p>

<p>ifInErrors</p>

<p>Descriptor: ifInErrors Identifier: 1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.14
ASN.1 Syntax: Counter32</p>

<p>The number of inbound packets that contained errors
preventing them from being deliverable to a higher-layer
protocol.</p>

<p>ifInUnknownProtos</p>

<p>Descriptor: ifInUnknownProtos Identifier:
1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.15 ASN.1 Syntax: Counter32</p>

<p>The number of packets received via the interface which
were discarded because of an unknown or unsupported
protocol.</p>

<p>ifOutOctets</p>

<p>Descriptor: ifOutOctets Identifier: 1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.16
ASN.1 Syntax: Counter32</p>

<p>The total number of octets transmitted out of the
interface, including framing characters.</p>

<p>ifOutUcastPkts</p>

<p>Descriptor: ifOutUcastPkts Identifier:
1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.17 ASN.1 Syntax: Counter32</p>

<p>The total number of packets that higher-level protocols
requested be transmitted to a subnetwork-unicast address,
including those that were discarded or not sent.</p>

<p>ifOutNUcastPkts</p>

<p>Descriptor: ifOutNUcastPkts Identifier:
1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.18 ASN.1 Syntax: Counter32</p>

<p>The total number of packets that higher-level protocols
requested be transmitted to a non- unicast (i.e., a
subnetwork-broadcast or subnet- work-multicast) address,
including those that were discarded or not sent.</p>

<p>ifOutDiscards</p>

<p>Descriptor: ifOutDiscards Identifier:
1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.19 ASN.1 Syntax: Counter32</p>

<p>The number of outbound packets which were chosen to be
discarded even though no errors had been detected to prevent
their being transmitted. One possible reason for discarding
such a packet could be to free up buffer space.</p>

<p>ifOutErrors</p>

<p>Descriptor: ifOutErrors Identifier: 1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.20
ASN.1 Syntax: Counter32</p>

<p>The number of outbound packets that could not be
transmitted because of errors.</p>

<p>ifOutQLen</p>

<p>Descriptor: ifOutQLen Identifier: 1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.21
ASN.1 Syntax: Unsigned32</p>

<p>The length of the output packet queue (in packets).</p>

<p>frInOctets</p>

<p>From: Simon Ferrett &lt;simonf@world.net&gt;</p>

<p>frInOctets =&gt; 1.3.6.1.2.1.10.32.2.1.9 frOutOctets
=&gt; 1.3.6.1.2.1.10.32.2.1.7</p>

<p>which when used in the form:</p>


<p>frInOctets.pp.dd&amp;frOutOctets.pp.dd:community@cisco.router</p>

<p>where pp is the physical port that the frame relay pvc
is defined on and dd is the DLCI of the pvc gets you the in
and out octets for just that pvc.</p>

<p>ifAdminHack and ifOperHack</p>

<p>The return values of ifAdminStatus and ifOperStatus are
not very use- full for graphing. Use ifOperHack and
ifAdminHack instead. They return 1 for UP and 0
otherwise.</p>

<p>Note these are not real MIB entities but mrtg hacks</p>

<p>PseudoZero and PseudoOne</p>

<p>will return 0 and 1 respectively</p>

<p>Note these are not real MIB entities but mrtg hacks</p>
