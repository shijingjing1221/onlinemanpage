<p>NAME rcsclean - clean up working files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rcsclean [options] [ file ... ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION rcsclean removes files that are not being
worked on. rcsclean -u also unlocks and removes files that
are being worked on but have not changed.</p>

<p>For each file given, rcsclean compares the working file
and a revision in the corresponding RCS file. If it finds a
difference, it does noth- ing. Otherwise, it first unlocks
the revision if the -u option is given, and then removes the
working file unless the working file is writable and the
revision is locked. It logs its actions by outputting the
corresponding rcs -u and rm -f commands on the standard
output.</p>

<p>Files are paired as explained in ci(1). If no file is
given, all work- ing files in the current directory are
cleaned. Pathnames matching an RCS suffix denote RCS files;
all others denote working files.</p>

<p>The number of the revision to which the working file is
compared may be attached to any of the options -n, -q, -r,
or -u. If no revision num- ber is specified, then if the -u
option is given and the caller has one revision locked,
rcsclean uses that revision; otherwise rcsclean uses the
latest revision on the default branch, normally the
root.</p>

<p>rcsclean is useful for clean targets in makefiles. See
also rcsd- iff(1), which prints out the differences, and
ci(1), which normally reverts to the previous revision if a
file was not changed.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -ksubst Use subst style keyword substitution
when retrieving the revi- sion for comparison. See co(1) for
details.</p>

<p>-n[rev] Do not actually remove any files or unlock any
revisions. Using this option will tell you what rcsclean
would do without actu- ally doing it.</p>

<p>-q[rev] Do not log the actions taken on standard
output.</p>

<p>-r[rev] This option has no effect other than specifying
the revision for comparison.</p>

<p>-T Preserve the modification time on the RCS file even
if the RCS file changes because a lock is removed. This
option can sup- press extensive recompilation caused by a
make(1) dependency of some other copy of the working file on
the RCS file. Use this option with care; it can suppress
recompilation even when it is needed, i.e. when the lock
removal would mean a change to key- word strings in the
other working file.</p>

<p>-u[rev] Unlock the revision if it is locked and no
difference is found.</p>

<p>-V Print RCSs version number.</p>

<p>-Vn Emulate RCS version n. See co(1) for details.</p>

<p>-xsuffixes Use suffixes to characterize RCS files. See
ci(1) for details.</p>

<p>-zzone Use zone as the time zone for keyword
substitution; see co(1) for details.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES rcsclean *.c *.h</p>

<p>removes all working files ending in .c or .h that were
not changed since their checkout.</p>

<p>rcsclean</p>

<p>removes all working files in the current directory that
were not changed since their checkout.</p>

<p>FILES rcsclean accesses files much as ci(1) does.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT RCSINIT options prepended to the argument
list, separated by spaces. A backslash escapes spaces within
an option. The RCSINIT options are prepended to the argument
lists of most RCS commands. Use- ful RCSINIT options include
-q, -V, -x, and -z.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS The exit status is zero if and only if all
operations were successful. Missing working files and RCS
files are silently ignored.</p>

operations.</p>
