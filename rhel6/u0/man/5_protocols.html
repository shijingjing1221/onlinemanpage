<p>PROTOCOLS(5) Linux Programmer s Manual PROTOCOLS(5)</p>

<p>NAME protocols - the protocols definition file</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This file is a plain ASCII file, describing
the various DARPA internet protocols that are available from
the TCP/IP subsystem. It should be consulted instead of
using the numbers in the ARPA include files, or, even worse,
just guessing them. These numbers will occur in the proto-
col field of any IP header.</p>

<p>Keep this file untouched since changes would result in
incorrect IP packages. Protocol numbers and names are
specified by the IANA (Inter- net Assigned Numbers
Authority).</p>

<p>Each line is of the following format:</p>

<p>protocol number aliases ...</p>

<p>where the fields are delimited by spaces or tabs. Empty
lines are ignored. If a line contains a hash mark (#), the
hash mark and the part of the line following it are
ignored.</p>

<p>The field descriptions are:</p>

<p>protocol the native name for the protocol. For example
ip, tcp, or udp.</p>

<p>number the official number for this protocol as it will
appear within the IP header.</p>

<p>aliases optional aliases for the protocol.</p>

<p>This file might be distributed over a network using a
network-wide nam- ing service like Yellow Pages/NIS or
BIND/Hesiod.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/protocols The protocols definition file.</p>
