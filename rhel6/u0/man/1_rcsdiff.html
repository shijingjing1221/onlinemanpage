<p>NAME rcsdiff - compare RCS revisions</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rcsdiff [ -ksubst ] [ -q ] [ -rrev1 [ -rrev2 ]
] [ -T ] [ -V[n] ] [ -xsuffixes ] [ -zzone ] [ diff options
] file ...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION rcsdiff runs diff(1) to compare two
revisions of each RCS file given.</p>

<p>Pathnames matching an RCS suffix denote RCS files; all
others denote working files. Names are paired as explained
in ci(1).</p>

<p>The option -q suppresses diagnostic output. Zero, one,
or two revi- sions may be specified with -r. The option
-ksubst affects keyword substitution when extracting
revisions, as described in co(1); for example, -kk -r1.1
-r1.2 ignores differences in keyword values when comparing
revisions 1.1 and 1.2. To avoid excess output from locker
name substitution, -kkvl is assumed if (1) at most one
revision option is given, (2) no -k option is given, (3)
-kkv is the default keyword substitution, and (4) the
working files mode would be produced by co -l. See co(1) for
details about -T, -V, -x and -z. Otherwise, all options of
diff(1) that apply to regular files are accepted, with the
same meaning as for diff.</p>

<p>If both rev1 and rev2 are omitted, rcsdiff compares the
latest revision on the default branch (by default the trunk)
with the contents of the corresponding working file. This is
useful for determining what you changed since the last
checkin.</p>

<p>If rev1 is given, but rev2 is omitted, rcsdiff compares
revision rev1 of the RCS file with the contents of the
corresponding working file.</p>

<p>If both rev1 and rev2 are given, rcsdiff compares
revisions rev1 and rev2 of the RCS file.</p>

<p>Both rev1 and rev2 may be given numerically or
symbolically.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE The command</p>

<p>rcsdiff f.c</p>

<p>compares the latest revision on the default branch of
the RCS file to the contents of the working file f.c.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT RCSINIT options prepended to the argument
list, separated by spaces. See ci(1) for details.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS Exit status is 0 for no differences during
any comparison, 1 for some differences, 2 for trouble.</p>
