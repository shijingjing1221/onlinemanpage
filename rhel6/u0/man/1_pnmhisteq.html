<p>NAME pnmhisteq - histogram equalize a PNM image</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pnmhisteq</p>

<p>[-gray]</p>

<p>[-rmap pgmfile]</p>

<p>[-wmap pgmfile]</p>

<p>[-verbose]</p>

<p>[pnmfile]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pnmhisteq increases the contrast of a PGM or PPM image
through the technique of histogram equalization.[1]</p>

<p>pnmhisteq computes a histogram of the luminosity of the
pixels in the image. It then calculates a mapping between
each luminosity and a new luminosity such that it spreads
out intensity levels around histogram peaks and compresses
them at troughs. I.e. it moves pixels around in the
histogram so as to make it flat. It applies that mapping to
the input image to produce the output image. The effect of
this is that the image has equal numbers of pixels at each
possible intensity level, which means it uses the available
levels of intensity more efficiently and thereby has more
visible detail.</p>

<p>Mathematically, the luminosity mapping is this: Assume
the pixels are sorted by luminosity into B buckets numbered
from 0 (lowest luminosity) to B-1. N[i] is the number of
pixels in bucket i. T is the total num- ber of pixels (sum
of N[i] over all i). W is the luminosity of white.</p>

<p>pnmhisteq replaces an input pixel whose luminosity falls
into bucket j with one whose luminosity is:</p>

<p>j --- &gt; (N[i] / T) * W / --- i=0</p>

<p>Considering a grayscale image for simplicity, this means
that pixels in the most luminous bucket become white. Pixels
in the 10th per centile of luminosity become 10% of
white.</p>

<p>If youre processing a related set of images, for example
frames of an animation, its generally best to apply the same
luminosity mapping to every frame, since otherwise you ll
get distracting frame-to-frame changes in the brightness of
objects. pnmhisteqs -wmap option allows you to save, as a
PGM image, the luminosity map it computes from an image. The
-rmap option causes pnmisteq to use such an image as its
luminosity map.</p>

<p>So you can run pnmhisteq with -wmap on a composite you
created with pnmcat of the images you intend to process.
Then, you can run pnmisteq with -rmap on each of the
individual images, using the luminosity map you generated
from the composite.</p>

<p>OPTIONS You can abbreviate any option to its shortest
unique prefix.</p>

<p>-gray When processing a color image, only gray pixels
(those with identical red, green, and blue values) are
included in the his- togram and modified in the output
image. This is a special pur- pose option intended for
images where the actual data are gray scale, with color
annotations you don t want modified. Weather satellite
images that show continent outlines in color are best
processed using this option. The option has no effect when
the input is a graymap.</p>

<p>-rmap mapfile Process the image using the luminosity map
specified by the PGM file mapfile.</p>

<p>The PGM image, usually created by an earlier run of
pnmhisteq with the -wmap option, contains a single row with
number of columns equal to the maxval (greatest intensity
value) of the image plus one. Each pixel in the image is
transformed by look- ing up its luminosity in the
corresponding column in the map file (column number =
luminosity) and changing it to the value given by that
column.</p>

<p>-wmap mapfile Creates a PGM file mapfile, containing the
luminosity map com- puted from the histogram of the input
image. This map file can be read on subsequent runs of
pnmhisteq with the -rmap option, allowing a group of images
to be processed with an identical map.</p>

<p>-verbose Prints the histogram and luminosity map on
Standard Error.</p>

<p>LIMITATIONS Histogram equalization is effective for
increasing the visible detail in scientific imagery and in
some continuous-tone pictures. It is often too drastic,
however, for scanned halftone images, where it does an
excellent job of making halftone artifacts apparent. You
might want to experiment with pnmnorm and pnmgamma for more
subtle contrast enhancement.</p>

<p>The luminosity map file supplied by the -rmap option
must have the same maxval as the input image. This is always
the case when the map file was created by the -wmap option
of pnmhisteq. If this restriction causes a problem, simply
adjust the maxval of the map with pamdepth to agree with the
input image.</p>

<p>If the input is a PBM file (on which histogram
equalization is an identity operation), the only effect of
passing the file through pnmhisteq will be the passage of
time.</p>
