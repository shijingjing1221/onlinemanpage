<p>BCOPY(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual BCOPY(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME bcopy - memory operations (LEGACY)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;strings.h&gt;</p>

<p>void bcopy(const void *s1, void *s2, size_t n);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The bcopy() function shall copy n bytes from
the area pointed to by s1 to the area pointed to by s2.</p>

<p>The bytes are copied correctly even if the area pointed
to by s1 over- laps the area pointed to by s2.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The bcopy() function shall not return a
value.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The memmove() function is preferred
over this function.</p>

<p>The following are approximately equivalent (note the
order of the argu- ments):</p>

<p>bcopy(s1,s2,n) ~= memmove(s2,s1,n)</p>

<p>For maximum portability, it is recommended to replace
the function call to bcopy() as follows:</p>

<p>#define bcopy(b1,b2,len) (memmove((b2), (b1), (len)),
(void) 0)</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS This function may be withdrawn in a
future version.</p>

Std 1003.1-2001, &lt;strings.h&gt;</p>
