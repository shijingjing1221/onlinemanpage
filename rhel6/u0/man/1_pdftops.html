<p>NAME pdftops - Portable Document Format (PDF) to
PostScript converter (ver- sion 3.00)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pdftops [options] &lt;PDF-file&gt;
[&lt;PS-file&gt;]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Pdftops converts Portable Document Format
(PDF) files to PostScript so they can be printed.</p>

<p>Pdftops reads the PDF file, PDF-file, and writes a
PostScript file, PS- file. If PS-file is not specified,
pdftops converts file.pdf to file.ps (or file.eps with the
-eps option). If PS-file is &acute;-, the PostScript is sent
to stdout.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -f number Specifies the first page to print.</p>

<p>-l number Specifies the last page to print.</p>

<p>-level1 Generate Level 1 PostScript. The resulting
PostScript files will be significantly larger (if they
contain images), but will print on Level 1 printers. This
also converts all images to black and white. No more than
one of the PostScript level options (-level1, -level1sep,
-level2, -level2sep, -level3, -level3Sep) may be given.</p>

<p>-level1sep Generate Level 1 separable PostScript. All
colors are converted to CMYK. Images are written with
separate stream data for the four components.</p>

<p>-level2 Generate Level 2 PostScript. Level 2 supports
color images and image compression. This is the default
setting.</p>

<p>-level2sep Generate Level 2 separable PostScript. All
colors are converted to CMYK. The PostScript separation
convention operators are used to handle custom (spot)
colors.</p>

<p>-level3 Generate Level 3 PostScript. This enables all
Level 2 features plus CID font embedding.</p>

<p>-level3Sep Generate Level 3 separable PostScript. The
separation handling is the same as for -level2Sep.</p>

<p>-origpagesizes Generate a PostScript file with variable
page sizes and orienta- tions, taking for each page the size
of the original page in the PDF file. The PostScript file
contains &quot;&lt;&lt;/PageSize [WIDTH HEIGHT]&gt;&gt;
setpagedevice&quot; lines in each page header, so that the
paper input tray gets correctly changed on the printer. This
option should be used when pdftops is used as a print
filter. Any specification of the page size via -paper,
-paperw, or -paperh will get overridden as long as each page
of the PDF file has a defined paper size. No more than one
of the mode options (-origpagesizes, -eps, -form) may be
given.</p>

<p>-eps Generate an Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) file. An
EPS file contains a single image, so if you use this option
with a multi- page PDF file, you must use -f and -l to
specify a single page. No more than one of the mode options
(-origpagesizes, -eps, -form) may be given.</p>

<p>-form Generate a PostScript form which can be imported
by software that understands forms. A form contains a single
page, so if you use this option with a multi-page PDF file,
you must use -f and -l to specify a single page. The -level1
option cannot be used with -form. No more than one of the
mode options (-origpa- gesizes, -eps, -form) may be
given.</p>

<p>-opi Generate OPI comments for all images and forms
which have OPI information. (This option is only available
if pdftops was com- piled with OPI support.)</p>

<p>-noembt1 By default, any Type 1 fonts which are embedded
in the PDF file are copied into the PostScript file. This
option causes pdftops to substitute base fonts instead.
Embedded fonts make PostScript files larger, but may be
necessary for readable out- put.</p>

<p>-noembtt By default, any TrueType fonts which are
embedded in the PDF file are copied into the PostScript
file. This option causes pdftops to substitute base fonts
instead. Embedded fonts make PostScript files larger, but
may be necessary for readable out- put. Also, some
PostScript interpreters do not have TrueType
rasterizers.</p>

<p>-noembcidps By default, any CID PostScript fonts which
are embedded in the PDF file are copied into the PostScript
file. This option dis- ables that embedding. No attempt is
made to substitute for non- embedded CID PostScript
fonts.</p>

<p>-noembcidtt By default, any CID TrueType fonts which are
embedded in the PDF file are copied into the PostScript
file. This option disables that embedding. No attempt is
made to substitute for non-embed- ded CID TrueType
fonts.</p>

<p>-passfonts By default, references to non-embedded 8-bit
fonts in the PDF file are substituted with the closest
&quot;Helvetica&quot;, &quot;Times- Roman&quot;, or
&quot;Courier&quot; font. This option passes references to
non-embedded fonts through to the PostScript file.</p>

<p>-preload preload images and forms</p>

<p>-paper size Set the paper size to one of
&quot;letter&quot;, &quot;legal&quot;, &quot;A4&quot;, or
&quot;A3&quot;. This can also be set to &quot;match&quot;,
which will set the paper size to match the size specified in
the PDF file. -origpagesizes overrides this setting if the
PDF file has defined page sizes.</p>

<p>-paperw size Set the paper width, in points.
-origpagesizes overrides this setting if the PDF file has
defined page sizes.</p>

<p>-paperh size Set the paper height, in points.
-origpagesizes overrides this setting if the PDF file has
defined page sizes.</p>

<p>-nocrop By default, output is cropped to the CropBox
specified in the PDF file. This option disables
cropping.</p>

<p>-expand Expand PDF pages smaller than the paper to fill
the paper. By default, these pages are not scaled.</p>

<p>-noshrink Dont scale PDF pages which are larger than the
paper. By default, pages larger than the paper are shrunk to
fit.</p>

<p>-nocenter By default, PDF pages smaller than the paper
(after any scaling) are centered on the paper. This option
causes them to be aligned to the lower-left corner of the
paper instead.</p>

<p>-duplex Set the Duplex pagedevice entry in the
PostScript file. This tells duplex-capable printers to
enable duplexing.</p>

<p>-opw password Specify the owner password for the PDF
file. Providing this will bypass all security
restrictions.</p>

<p>-upw password Specify the user password for the PDF
file.</p>

<p>-q Dont print any messages or errors.</p>

<p>-v Print copyright and version information.</p>

<p>-h Print usage information. (-help and --help are
equivalent.)</p>

<p>EXIT CODES The Xpdf tools use the following exit
codes:</p>

<p>0 No error.</p>

<p>1 Error opening a PDF file.</p>

<p>2 Error opening an output file.</p>

<p>3 Error related to PDF permissions.</p>

<p>99 Other error.</p>
