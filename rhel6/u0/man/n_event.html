<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME event - Miscellaneous event facilities: define
virtual events and gen- erate events</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS event option ?arg arg ...?
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The event command provides several
facilities for dealing with window system events, such as
defining virtual events and synthesizing events. The command
has several different forms, determined by the first argu-
ment. The following forms are currently supported:</p>

<p>event add &lt;&lt;virtual&gt;&gt; sequence ?sequence
...? Associates the virtual event virtual with the physical
event sequence(s) given by the sequence arguments, so that
the virtual event will trigger whenever any one of the
sequences occurs. Virtual may be any string value and
sequence may have any of the values allowed for the sequence
argument to the bind command. If virtual is already defined,
the new physical event sequences add to the existing
sequences for the event.</p>

<p>event delete &lt;&lt;virtual&gt;&gt; ?sequence sequence
...? Deletes each of the sequences from those associated
with the virtual event given by virtual. Virtual may be any
string value and sequence may have any of the values allowed
for the sequence argument to the bind command. Any sequences
not currently asso- ciated with virtual are ignored. If no
sequence argument is provided, all physical event sequences
are removed for virtual, so that the virtual event will not
trigger anymore.</p>

<p>event generate window event ?option value option value
...? Generates a window event and arranges for it to be
processed just as if it had come from the window system.
Window gives the path name of the window for which the event
will be generated; it may also be an identifier (such as
returned by winfo id) as long as it is for a window in the
current application. Event provides a basic description of
the event, such as &lt;Shift-But- ton-2&gt; or
&lt;&lt;Paste&gt;&gt;. If Window is empty the whole screen
is meant, and coordinates are relative to the screen. Event
may have any of the forms allowed for the sequence argument
of the bind command except that it must consist of a single
event pat- tern, not a sequence. Option-value pairs may be
used to specify additional attributes of the event, such as
the x and y mouse position; see EVENT FIELDS below. If the
-when option is not specified, the event is processed
immediately: all of the han- dlers for the event will
complete before the event generate com- mand returns. If the
-when option is specified then it deter- mines when the
event is processed. Certain events, such as key events,
require that the window has focus to receive the event
properly.</p>

<p>event info ?&lt;&lt;virtual&gt;&gt;? Returns information
about virtual events. If the &lt;&lt;virtual&gt;&gt;
argument is omitted, the return value is a list of all the
vir- tual events that are currently defined. If
&lt;&lt;virtual&gt;&gt; is spec- ified then the return value
is a list whose elements are the physical event sequences
currently defined for the given virtual event; if the
virtual event is not defined then an empty string is
returned.</p>

<p>Note that virtual events that that are not bound to
physical event sequences are not returned by event info.</p>

<p>EVENT FIELDS The following options are supported for the
event generate command. These correspond to the % expansions
allowed in binding scripts for the bind command.</p>

<p>-above window Window specifies the above field for the
event, either as a win- dow path name or as an integer
window id. Valid for Configure events. Corresponds to the %a
substitution for binding scripts.</p>

<p>-borderwidth size Size must be a screen distance; it
specifies the border_width field for the event. Valid for
Configure events. Corresponds to the %B substitution for
binding scripts.</p>

<p>-button number Number must be an integer; it specifies
the detail field for a ButtonPress or ButtonRelease event,
overriding any button num- ber provided in the base event
argument. Corresponds to the %b substitution for binding
scripts.</p>

<p>-count number Number must be an integer; it specifies
the count field for the event. Valid for Expose events.
Corresponds to the %c substi- tution for binding
scripts.</p>

<p>-data string String may be any value; it specifies the
user_data field for the event. Only valid for virtual
events. Corresponds to the %d substitution for virtual
events in binding scripts.</p>

<p>-delta number Number must be an integer; it specifies
the delta field for the MouseWheel event. The delta refers
to the direction and magni- tude the mouse wheel was
rotated. Note the value is not a screen distance but are
units of motion in the mouse wheel. Typically these values
are multiples of 120. For example, 120 should scroll the
text widget up 4 lines and -240 would scroll the text widget
down 8 lines. Of course, other widgets may define different
behaviors for mouse wheel motion. This field corresponds to
the %D substitution for binding scripts.</p>

<p>-detail detail Detail specifies the detail field for the
event and must be one of the following:</p>

<p>NotifyAncestor NotifyNonlinearVirtual NotifyDetailNone
NotifyPointer NotifyInferior NotifyPointerRoot
NotifyNonlinear NotifyVirtual</p>

<p>Valid for Enter, Leave, FocusIn and FocusOut events.
Corre- sponds to the %d substitution for binding
scripts.</p>

<p>-focus boolean Boolean must be a boolean value; it
specifies the focus field for the event. Valid for Enter and
Leave events. Corresponds to the %f substitution for binding
scripts.</p>

<p>-height size Size must be a screen distance; it
specifies the height field for the event. Valid for
Configure events. Corresponds to the %h substitution for
binding scripts.</p>

<p>-keycode number Number must be an integer; it specifies
the keycode field for the event. Valid for KeyPress and
KeyRelease events. Corre- sponds to the %k substitution for
binding scripts.</p>

<p>-keysym name Name must be the name of a valid keysym,
such as g, space, or Return; its corresponding keycode value
is used as the keycode field for event, overriding any
detail specified in the base event argument. Valid for
KeyPress and KeyRelease events. Cor- responds to the %K
substitution for binding scripts.</p>

<p>-mode notify Notify specifies the mode field for the
event and must be one of NotifyNormal, NotifyGrab,
NotifyUngrab, or NotifyWhileGrabbed. Valid for Enter, Leave,
FocusIn, and FocusOut events. Corre- sponds to the %m
substitution for binding scripts.</p>

<p>-override boolean Boolean must be a boolean value; it
specifies the over- ride_redirect field for the event. Valid
for Map, Reparent, and Configure events. Corresponds to the
%o substitution for bind- ing scripts.</p>

<p>-place where Where specifies the place field for the
event; it must be either PlaceOnTop or PlaceOnBottom. Valid
for Circulate events. Corresponds to the %p substitution for
binding scripts.</p>

<p>-root window Window must be either a window path name or
an integer window identifier; it specifies the root field
for the event. Valid for KeyPress, KeyRelease, ButtonPress,
ButtonRelease, Enter, Leave, and Motion events. Corresponds
to the %R substitution for binding scripts.</p>

<p>-rootx coord Coord must be a screen distance; it
specifies the x_root field for the event. Valid for
KeyPress, KeyRelease, ButtonPress, ButtonRelease, Enter,
Leave, and Motion events. Corresponds to the %X substitution
for binding scripts.</p>

<p>-rooty coord Coord must be a screen distance; it
specifies the y_root field for the event. Valid for
KeyPress, KeyRelease, ButtonPress, ButtonRelease, Enter,
Leave, and Motion events. Corresponds to the %Y substitution
for binding scripts.</p>

<p>-sendevent boolean Boolean must be a boolean value; it
specifies the send_event field for the event. Valid for all
events. Corresponds to the %E substitution for binding
scripts.</p>

<p>-serial number Number must be an integer; it specifies
the serial field for the event. Valid for all events.
Corresponds to the %# substi- tution for binding
scripts.</p>

<p>-state state State specifies the state field for the
event. For KeyPress, KeyRelease, ButtonPress, ButtonRelease,
Enter, Leave, and Motion events it must be an integer value.
For Visibility events it must be one of
VisibilityUnobscured, VisibilityPartiallyOb- scured, or
VisibilityFullyObscured. This option overrides any modifiers
such as Meta or Control specified in the base event.
Corresponds to the %s substitution for binding scripts.</p>

<p>-subwindow window Window specifies the subwindow field
for the event, either as a path name for a Tk widget or as
an integer window identifier. Valid for KeyPress,
KeyRelease, ButtonPress, ButtonRelease, Enter, Leave, and
Motion events. Similar to %S substitution for binding
scripts.</p>

<p>-time integer Integer must be an integer value; it
specifies the time field for the event. Valid for KeyPress,
KeyRelease, ButtonPress, ButtonRelease, Enter, Leave,
Motion, and Property events. Cor- responds to the %t
substitution for binding scripts.</p>

<p>-warp boolean boolean must be a boolean value; it
specifies whether the screen pointer should be warped as
well. Valid for KeyPress, KeyRelease, ButtonPress,
ButtonRelease, and Motion events. The pointer will only warp
to a window if it is mapped.</p>

<p>-width size Size must be a screen distance; it specifies
the width field for the event. Valid for Configure events.
Corresponds to the %w substitution for binding scripts.</p>

<p>-when when When determines when the event will be
processed; it must have one of the following values:</p>

<p>now Process the event immediately, before the command
returns. This also happens if the -when option is
omitted.</p>

<p>tail Place the event on Tcl s event queue behind any
events already queued for this application.</p>

<p>head Place the event at the front of Tcls event queue,
so that it will be handled before any other events already
queued.</p>

<p>mark Place the event at the front of Tcls event queue
but behind any other events already queued with -when mark.
This option is useful when generating a series of events
that should be processed in order but at the front of the
queue.</p>

<p>-x coord Coord must be a screen distance; it specifies
the x field for the event. Valid for KeyPress, KeyRelease,
ButtonPress, Button- Release, Motion, Enter, Leave, Expose,
Configure, Gravity, and Reparent events. Corresponds to the
%x substitution for binding scripts. If Window is empty the
coordinate is relative to the screen, and this option
corresponds to the %X substitution for binding scripts.</p>

<p>-y coord Coord must be a screen distance; it specifies
the y field for the event. Valid for KeyPress, KeyRelease,
ButtonPress, Button- Release, Motion, Enter, Leave, Expose,
Configure, Gravity, and Reparent events. Corresponds to the
%y substitution for binding scripts. If Window is empty the
coordinate is relative to the screen, and this option
corresponds to the %Y substitution for binding scripts.</p>

<p>Any options that are not specified when generating an
event are filled with the value 0, except for serial, which
is filled with the next X event serial number.</p>

<p>PREDEFINED VIRTUAL EVENTS Tk defines the following
virtual events for the purposes of notifica- tion:</p>

<p>&lt;&lt;AltUnderlined&gt;&gt; This is sent to widget to
notify it that the letter it has underlined (as an
accelerator indicator) with the -underline option has been
pressed in combination with the Alt key. The usual response
to this is to either focus into the widget (or some related
widget) or to invoke the widget.</p>

<p>&lt;&lt;ListboxSelect&gt;&gt; This is sent to a listbox
when the set of selected item(s) in the listbox is
updated.</p>

<p>&lt;&lt;MenuSelect&gt;&gt; This is sent to a menu when
the currently selected item in the menu changes. It is
intended for use with context-sensitive help systems.</p>

<p>&lt;&lt;Modified&gt;&gt; This is sent to a text widget
when the contents of the widget are changed.</p>

<p>&lt;&lt;Selection&gt;&gt; This is sent to a text widget
when the selection in the widget is changed.</p>

<p>&lt;&lt;TraverseIn&gt;&gt; This is sent to a widget when
the focus enters the widget because of a user-driven tab to
widget action.</p>

<p>&lt;&lt;TraverseOut&gt;&gt; This is sent to a widget
when the focus leaves the widget because of a user-driven
tab to widget action.</p>

<p>Tk defines the following virtual events for the purposes
of unifying bindings across multiple platforms. Users expect
them to behave in the following way:</p>

<p>&lt;&lt;Clear&gt;&gt; Delete the currently selected
widget contents.</p>

<p>&lt;&lt;Copy&gt;&gt; Copy the currently selected widget
contents to the clipboard.</p>

<p>&lt;&lt;Cut&gt;&gt; Move the currently selected widget
contents to the clipboard.</p>

<p>&lt;&lt;Paste&gt;&gt; Replace the currently selected
widget contents with the contents of the clipboard.</p>

<p>&lt;&lt;PasteSelection&gt;&gt; Insert the contents of
the selection at the mouse location. (This event has
meaningful %x and %y substitutions).</p>

<p>&lt;&lt;PrevWindow&gt;&gt; Traverse to the previous
window.</p>

<p>&lt;&lt;Redo&gt;&gt; Redo one undone action.</p>

<p>&lt;&lt;Undo&gt;&gt; Undo the last action.</p>

<p>VIRTUAL EVENT EXAMPLES In order for a virtual event
binding to trigger, two things must hap- pen. First, the
virtual event must be defined with the event add command.
Second, a binding must be created for the virtual event with
the bind command. Consider the following virtual event
definitions: event add &lt;&lt;Paste&gt;&gt;
&lt;Control-y&gt; event add &lt;&lt;Paste&gt;&gt;
&lt;Button-2&gt; event add &lt;&lt;Save&gt;&gt;
&lt;Control-X&gt;&lt;Control-S&gt; event add
&lt;&lt;Save&gt;&gt; &lt;Shift-F12&gt; In the bind command,
a virtual event can be bound like any other builtin event
type as follows: bind Entry &lt;&lt;Paste&gt;&gt; {%W insert
[selection get]} The double angle brackets are used to
specify that a virtual event is being bound. If the user
types Control-y or presses button 2, or if a
&lt;&lt;Paste&gt;&gt; virtual event is synthesized with
event generate, then the &lt;&lt;Paste&gt;&gt; binding will
be invoked.</p>

<p>If a virtual binding has the exact same sequence as a
separate physical binding, then the physical binding will
take precedence. Consider the following example: event add
&lt;&lt;Paste&gt;&gt; &lt;Control-y&gt;
&lt;Meta-Control-y&gt; bind Entry &lt;Control-y&gt; {puts
Control-y} bind Entry &lt;&lt;Paste&gt;&gt; {puts Paste}
When the user types Control-y the &lt;Control-y&gt; binding
will be invoked, because a physical event is considered more
specific than a virtual event, all other things being equal.
However, when the user types Meta-Control-y the
&lt;&lt;Paste&gt;&gt; binding will be invoked, because the
Meta modifier in the physical pattern associated with the
virtual binding is more specific than the &lt;Control-y&gt;
sequence for the physical event.</p>

<p>Bindings on a virtual event may be created before the
virtual event exists. Indeed, the virtual event never
actually needs to be defined, for instance, on platforms
where the specific virtual event would mean- ingless or
ungeneratable.</p>

<p>When a definition of a virtual event changes at run
time, all windows will respond immediately to the new
definition. Starting from the pre- ceding example, if the
following code is executed: bind &lt;Entry&gt;
&lt;Control-y&gt; {} event add &lt;&lt;Paste&gt;&gt;
&lt;Key-F6&gt; the behavior will change such in two ways.
First, the shadowed &lt;&lt;Paste&gt;&gt; binding will
emerge. Typing Control-y will no longer invoke the
&lt;Control-y&gt; binding, but instead invoke the virtual
event &lt;&lt;Paste&gt;&gt;. Second, pressing the F6 key
will now also invoke the &lt;&lt;Paste&gt;&gt; binding.</p>
