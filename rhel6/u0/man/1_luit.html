<p>LUIT(1) LUIT(1)</p>

<p>NAME luit - Locale and ISO 2022 support for Unicode
terminals</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS luit [ options ] [ -- ] [ program [ args ]
]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Luit is a filter that can be run between an
arbitrary application and a UTF-8 terminal emulator. It will
convert application output from the locales encoding into
UTF-8, and convert terminal input from UTF-8 into the
locales encoding.</p>

<p>An application may also request switching to a different
output encod- ing using ISO 2022 and ISO 6429 escape
sequences. Use of this feature is discouraged: multilingual
applications should be modified to directly generate UTF-8
instead.</p>

<p>Luit is usually invoked transparently by the terminal
emulator. For information about running luit from the
command line, see EXAMPLES below.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -h Display some summary help and quit.</p>

<p>-list List the supported charsets and encodings, then
quit.</p>

<p>-v Be verbose.</p>

<p>-c Function as a simple converter from standard input to
standard output.</p>

<p>-x Exit as soon as the child dies. This may cause luit
to lose data at the end of the childs output.</p>

<p>-argv0 name Set the childs name (as passed in
argv[0]).</p>

<p>-encoding encoding Set up luit to use encoding rather
than the current locales encoding.</p>

<p>+oss Disable interpretation of single shifts in
application output.</p>

<p>+ols Disable interpretation of locking shifts in
application output.</p>

<p>+osl Disable interpretation of character set selection
sequences in application output.</p>

<p>+ot Disable interpretation of all sequences and pass all
sequences in application output to the terminal unchanged.
This may lead to interesting results.</p>

<p>-k7 Generate seven-bit characters for keyboard
input.</p>

<p>+kss Disable generation of single-shifts for keyboard
input.</p>

<p>+kssgr Use GL codes after a single shift for keyboard
input. By default, GR codes are generated after a single
shift when gener- ating eight-bit keyboard input.</p>

<p>-kls Generate locking shifts (SO/SI) for keyboard
input.</p>

<p>-gl gn Set the initial assignment of GL. The argument
should be one of g0, g1, g2 or g3. The default depends on
the locale, but is usually g0.</p>

<p>-gr gk Set the initial assignment of GR. The default
depends on the locale, and is usually g2 except for EUC
locales, where it is g1.</p>

<p>-g0 charset Set the charset initially selected in G0.
The default depends on the locale, but is usually ASCII.</p>

<p>-g1 charset Set the charset initially selected in G1.
The default depends on the locale.</p>

<p>-g2 charset Set the charset initially selected in G2.
The default depends on the locale.</p>

<p>-g3 charset Set the charset initially selected in G3.
The default depends on the locale.</p>

<p>-ilog filename Log into filename all the bytes received
from the child.</p>

<p>-olog filename Log into filename all the bytes sent to
the terminal emulator.</p>

<p>-- End of options.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES The most typical use of luit is to adapt an
instance of XTerm to the locales encoding. Current versions
of XTerm invoke luit automatically when it is needed. If you
are using an older release of XTerm, or a different terminal
emulator, you may invoke luit manually:</p>

<p>$ xterm -u8 -e luit</p>

<p>If you are running in a UTF-8 locale but need to access
a remote machine that doesnt support UTF-8, luit can adapt
the remote output to your terminal:</p>

<p>$ LC_ALL=fr_FR luit ssh legacy-machine</p>

<p>Luit is also useful with applications that hard-wire an
encoding that is different from the one normally used on the
system or want to use legacy escape sequences for
multilingual output. In particular, ver- sions of Emacs that
do not speak UTF-8 well can use luit for multilin- gual
output:</p>

<p>$ luit -encoding ISO 8859-1 emacs -nw</p>

<p>And then, in Emacs,</p>

<p>M-x set-terminal-coding-system RET iso-2022-8bit-ss2
RET</p>

<p>FILES /usr/lib/X11/fonts/encodings/encodings.dir The
system-wide encodings directory.</p>

<p>/usr/share/X11/locale/locale.alias The file mapping
locales to locale encodings.</p>

<p>SECURITY On systems with SVR4 (Unix-98) ptys (Linux
version 2.2 and later, SVR4), luit should be run as the
invoking user.</p>

<p>On systems without SVR4 ( Unix-98 ) ptys (notably BSD
variants), run- ning luit as an ordinary user will leave the
tty world-writable; this is a security hole, and luit will
generate a warning (but still accept to run). A possible
solution is to make luit suid root; luit should drop
privileges sufficiently early to make this safe. However,
the startup code has not been exhaustively audited, and the
author takes no responsibility for any resulting security
issues.</p>

<p>Luit will refuse to run if it is installed setuid and
cannot safely drop privileges.</p>

<p>BUGS None of this complexity should be necessary.
Stateless UTF-8 through- out the system is the way to
go.</p>

<p>Charsets with a non-trivial intermediary byte are not
yet supported.</p>

<p>Selecting alternate sets of control characters is not
supported and will never be.</p>
