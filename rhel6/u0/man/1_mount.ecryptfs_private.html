<p>NAME mount.ecryptfs_private - eCryptfs private mount
helper.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS mount.ecryptfs_private</p>

<p>NOTE: This program will not dynamically load the
relevant keys. For this reason, it is recommended that users
use ecryptfs-mount-private(1) instead!</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION mount.ecryptfs_private is a mount helper
utility for non-root users, who are members of ecryptfs
group, to cryptographically mount a private directory,
~/Private.</p>

<p>If, and only if: - the private mount passphrase is in
their kernel keyring, and - the current user owns both
~/.Private and ~/Private, and - ~/Private is not already
mounted, then</p>

<p>This program will: - mount ~/.Private onto ~/Private -
as an ecryptfs filesystem - using the AES cipher - with a
key length of 16 bytes - using the passphrase whose
signature is in ~/.ecryptfs/Private.sig</p>

<p>The only setuid operation in this program is the call to
mount(8).</p>

<p>The ecryptfs-setup-private(1) utility will create the
~/.Private and ~/Private directories, generate a mount
passphrase, wrap the passphrase, and write the
~/.ecryptfs/Private.sig.</p>

<p>The system administrator can add the pam_ecryptfs.so
module to the PAM stack which will automatically use the
login passphrase to unwrap the mount passphrase, add the
passphrase to the users kernel keyring, and automatically
perform the mount. See pam_ecryptfs(8).</p>

<p>FILES ~/.Private - underlying directory containing
encrypted data</p>

<p>~/Private - mountpoint containing decrypted data (when
mounted)</p>

<p>~/.ecryptfs/Private.sig - file containing signature of
mountpoint passphrase</p>

<p>~/.ecryptfs/wrapped-passphrase - mount passphrase,
encrypted with the login passphrase</p>
