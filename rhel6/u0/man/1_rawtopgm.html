<p>NAME rawtopgm - convert raw grayscale bytes to a PGM
image</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rawtopgm</p>

<p>[-bpp [1|2]]</p>

<p>[-littleendian]</p>

<p>[-maxval N]</p>

<p>[-headerskip N]</p>

<p>[-rowskip N]</p>

<p>[-tb|-topbottom]</p>

<p>[width height]</p>

<p>[imagefile]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>rawtopgm reads raw grayscale values as input and
produces a PGM image as output. The input file is just a
sequence of pure binary numbers, either one or two bytes
each, either bigendian or littleendian, repre- senting gray
values. They may be arranged either top to bottom, left to
right or bottom to top, left to right. There may be
arbitrary header information at the start of the file (to
which rawtopgm pays no attention at all other than the
headers size).</p>

<p>Arguments to rawtopgm tell how to interpret the pixels
(a function that is served by a header in a regular graphics
format).</p>

<p>The width and height parameters tell the dimensions of
the image. If you omit these parameters, rawtopgm assumes it
is a quadratic image and bases the dimensions on the size of
the input stream. If this size is not a perfect square,
rawtopgm fails.</p>

<p>When you dont specify width and height, rawtopgm reads
the entire input stream into storage at once, which may take
a lot of storage. Otherwise, rawtopgm ordinarily stores only
one row at a time.</p>

<p>If you dont specify imagefile, or specify -, the input
is from Stan- dard Input.</p>

<p>The PGM output is to Standard Output.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -maxval N N is the maxval for the gray values in
the input, and is also the maxval of the PGM output image.
The default is the maximum value that can be represented in
the number of bytes used for each sample (i.e. 255 or
65535).</p>

<p>-bpp [1|2] tells the number of bytes that represent each
sample in the input. If the value is 2, The most significant
byte is first in the stream.</p>

<p>The default is 1 byte per sample.</p>

<p>-littleendian says that the bytes of each input sample
are ordered with the least significant byte first. Without
this option, rawtopgm assumes MSB first. This obviously has
no effect when there is only one byte per sample.</p>

<p>-headerskip N rawtopgm skips over N bytes at the
beginning of the stream and reads the image immediately
after. The default is 0.</p>

<p>This is useful when the input is actually some graphics
format that has a descriptive header followed by an ordinary
raster, and you dont have a program that understands the
header or you want to ignore the header.</p>

<p>-rowskip N If there is padding at the ends of the rows,
you can skip it with this option. Note that rowskip need not
be an integer. Amazingly, I once had an image with 0.376
bytes of padding per row. This turned out to be due to a
file-transfer problem, but I was still able to read the
image.</p>

<p>Skipping a fractional byte per row means skipping one
byte per multiple rows.</p>

<p>-bt -bottomfirst By default, rawtopgm assumes the pixels
in the input go top to bottom, left to right. If you specify
-bt or -bottomfirst, raw- topgm assumes the pixels go bottom
to top, left to right. The Molecular Dynamics and Leica
confocal format, for example, use the latter
arrangement.</p>

<p>If you dont specify -bt when you should or vice versa,
the resulting image is upside down, which you can correct
with pam- flip.</p>

<p>This option causes rawtopgm to read the entire input
stream into storage at once, which may take a lot of
storage. Ordinarly, rawtopgm stores only one row at a
time.</p>

<p>For backwards compatibility, rawtopgm also accepts -tb
and -topbottom to mean exactly the same thing. The reasons
these are named backwards is that the original author
thought of it as specifying that the wrong results of
assuming the data is top to bottom should be corrected by
flipping the result top for bottom. Today, we think of it as
simply specifying the format of the input data so that there
are no wrong results.</p>
