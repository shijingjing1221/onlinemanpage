<p>NAME ioctl - control device</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/ioctl.h&gt;</p>

<p>int ioctl(int d, int request, ...);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The ioctl() function manipulates the
underlying device parameters of special files. In
particular, many operating characteristics of char- acter
special files (e.g., terminals) may be controlled with
ioctl() requests. The argument d must be an open file
descriptor.</p>

<p>The second argument is a device-dependent request code.
The third argument is an untyped pointer to memory. Its
traditionally char *argp (from the days before void * was
valid C), and will be so named for this discussion.</p>

<p>An ioctl() request has encoded in it whether the
argument is an in parameter or out parameter, and the size
of the argument argp in bytes. Macros and defines used in
specifying an ioctl() request are located in the file
&lt;sys/ioctl.h&gt;.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Usually, on success zero is returned. A few
ioctl() requests use the return value as an output parameter
and return a non-negative value on success. On error, -1 is
returned, and errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS EBADF d is not a valid descriptor.</p>

<p>EFAULT argp references an inaccessible memory area.</p>

<p>EINVAL Request or argp is not valid.</p>

<p>ENOTTY d is not associated with a character special
device.</p>

<p>ENOTTY The specified request does not apply to the kind
of object that the descriptor d references.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO No single standard. Arguments, returns,
and semantics of ioctl() vary according to the device driver
in question (the call is used as a catch-all for operations
that dont cleanly fit the Unix stream I/O model). See
ioctl_list(2) for a list of many of the known ioctl() calls.
The ioctl() function call appeared in Version 7 AT&amp;T
Unix.</p>

<p>NOTES In order to use this call, one needs an open file
descriptor. Often the open(2) call has unwanted side
effects, that can be avoided under Linux by giving it the
O_NONBLOCK flag.</p>
