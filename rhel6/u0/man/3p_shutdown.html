<p>SHUTDOWN(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual SHUTDOWN(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME shutdown - shut down socket send and receive
operations</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;</p>

<p>int shutdown(int socket, int how);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The shutdown() function shall cause all or
part of a full-duplex con- nection on the socket associated
with the file descriptor socket to be shut down.</p>

<p>The shutdown() function takes the following
arguments:</p>

<p>socket Specifies the file descriptor of the socket.</p>

<p>how Specifies the type of shutdown. The values are as
follows:</p>

<p>SHUT_RD Disables further receive operations.</p>

<p>SHUT_WR Disables further send operations.</p>

<p>SHUT_RDWR Disables further send and receive
operations.</p>

<p>The shutdown() function disables subsequent send and/or
receive opera- tions on a socket, depending on the value of
the how argument.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, shutdown()
shall return 0; otherwise, -1 shall be returned and errno
set to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The shutdown() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EBADF The socket argument is not a valid file
descriptor.</p>

<p>EINVAL The how argument is invalid.</p>

<p>ENOTCONN The socket is not connected.</p>

<p>ENOTSOCK The socket argument does not refer to a
socket.</p>

<p>The shutdown() function may fail if:</p>

<p>ENOBUFS Insufficient resources were available in the
system to perform the operation.</p>
