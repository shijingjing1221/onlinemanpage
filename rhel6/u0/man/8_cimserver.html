<p>NAME cimserver - start or stop the CIM Server; display
the version number of the CIM Server</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS cimserver [configProperty=value] ...</p>

<p>cimserver -s [ shutdownTimeout = value ]</p>

<p>cimserver -v</p>

<p>cimserver -h</p>

<p>cimserver --help</p>

<p>cimserver --version</p>

<p>Remarks This command can only be executed by a
privileged user.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The cimserver command provides a command
line interface to stop and start the CIM Server, as well as
to display the version number of the CIM Server.</p>

<p>After installation, the CIM Server must be started using
the cimserver command. If the system is rebooted, the CIM
Server will automatically restart, with the exception of the
case where the CIM Server was shut- down prior to the
reboot. Generally, once the CIM Server is started, it is
expected to be always running and ready to serve CIM
requests. How- ever, if the CIM Server must be stopped and
restarted, the cimserver command can be used to shutdown the
CIM Server gracefully and restart it at a later time.</p>

<p>Starting the CIM Server Issuing the cimserver command
without any options starts the CIM Server process.</p>

<p>When starting the CIM Server using the cimserver
command, the &lt;config- Property=value&gt; syntax can be
used to set the configuration properties to be used by the
CIM Server. It is important to know that the values
specified in the cimserver command apply only to the current
CIM Server process that gets started. The default values for
the configuration properties do not change. For a list of
the CIM Server configuration properties, see the man page
for the cimconfig command.</p>

<p>Shutting down the CIM Server Issuing the cimserver
command with the -s option stops the CIM Server. Optionally,
a timeout value can be specified by setting the shutdown-
Timeout configuration property.</p>

<p>Under normal operation, CIM Server should be able to be
shutdown fairly quickly without problem. There are, however,
situations that may pre- vent CIM Server from shutting down
within a reasonable amount of time. For example, a provider
that is not responding to requests, or a provider that is
servicing a long-running CIM request. To handle such
situations and to ensure that the CIM Server can be shutdown
without having the user wait a long period of time (or
indefinitely), a shut- down timeout value is used.</p>

<p>The shutdown timeout value is the maximum amount of time
(in seconds) the user is willing to wait for the CIM Server
to complete all the outstanding CIM operation requests
before shutting down the CIM Server. If the specified
shutdown timeout period expires, the CIM Server will be
shutdown even if there are CIM operations in progress. The
shutdown timeout value is a CIM Server configuration
property (shutdownTimeout ) that can be changed using the
command. The default shutdown timeout value is 10
seconds.</p>

<p>A timeout value (in seconds) can be specified in the
cimserver command to shutdown the CIM Server using the
=value&gt; syntax. This overrides the default shutdown
timeout value. The minimum timeout value is 2 seconds.</p>

<p>While CIM Server is shutting down, a client connection
request will result in a connection error (the same as if
the CIM Server were not running). For clients who have
already established a connection to the CIM Server, new CIM
requests will be rejected with a CIM error indicat- ing that
the CIM Server is shutting down.</p>

<p>When a client receives a response containing a CIM error
indicating that the CIM Server is shutting down, it should
close the connection and reconnect to CIM Server at a later
time.</p>

<p>Options The cimserver command recognizes the following
options:</p>

<p>-v, --version Display the version number of the CIM
Server.</p>

<p>-h, --help Display the command usage.</p>

<p>-s Stop the CIM Server.</p>

<p>Specify the timeout value for shutting down the CIM
Server. This can only be used in conjunction with the -s
option. The minimum timeout value is 2 seconds. If this is
not specified, the default config- urable timeout value will
be used.</p>

<p>configProperty=value Set the value for the specified
configuration property to be used in starting the CIM
Server.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The cimserver command returns one of the
following values:</p>

<p>0 Success 1 Error</p>

<p>When an error occurs, an error message is written to
stderr and an error value of 1 is returned.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS unable to connect to CIM Server. CIM Server
may not be running.</p>

<p>The cimserver command was issued to stop the CIM Server
when CIM Server was not running. An exit status value of 1
is returned.</p>

<p>Error: Bind failed: Failed to bind socket.</p>

<p>The cimserver command was issued to start the CIM Server
and the CIM Server was already running. An exit status value
of 1 is returned.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Stop the CIM Server with the default timeout
value of 10 seconds.</p>

<p>cimserver -s</p>

<p>Stop the CIM Server with a timeout value of 5
seconds.</p>

<p>cimserver -s shutdownTimeout=5</p>

<p>Start the CIM Server.</p>

<p>cimserver</p>

<p>Start the CIM Server with the configuration property
enableNamespaceAu- thorization set to true.</p>

<p>cimserver enableNamespaceAuthorization=true</p>

<p>Display the version number of the CIM Server. This
version number is used to identify the release version of
the CIM Server in the OpenPega- sus release.</p>

<p>cimserver -v</p>

<p>Display the command usage.</p>

<p>cimserver -h</p>
