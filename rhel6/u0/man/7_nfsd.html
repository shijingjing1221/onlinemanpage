<p>NAME nfsd - special filesystem for controlling Linux NFS
server</p>

<p>SYNPOSIS mount -t nfsd nfsd /proc/fs/nfsd</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The nfsd filesytem is a special filesystem
which provides access to the Linux NFS server. The
filesystem consists of a single directory which contains a
number of files. These files are actually gateways into the
NFS server. Writing to them can affect the server. Reading
from them can provide information about the server.</p>

<p>This file system is only available in Linux 2.6 and
later series ker- nels (and in the later parts of the 2.5
development series leading up to 2.6). This man page does
not apply to 2.4 and earlier.</p>

<p>As well as this filesystem, there are a collection of
files in the procfs filesystem (normally mounted at /proc)
which are used to control the NFS server. This manual page
describes all of these files.</p>

<p>The exportfs and mountd programs (part of the nfs-utils
package) expect to find this filesystem mounted at
/proc/fs/nfsd or /proc/fs/nfs. If it is not mounted, they
will fall-back on 2.4 style functionality. This involves
accessing the NFS server via a systemcall. This system- call
is scheduled to be removed after the 2.6 kernel series.</p>

<p>DETAILS The three files in the nfsd filesystem are:</p>

<p>exports This file contains a list of filesystems that
are currently exported and clients that each filesystem is
exported to, together with a list of export options for that
client/filesys- tem pair. This is similar to the
/proc/fs/nfs/exports file in 2.4. One difference is that a
client doesn t necessarily corre- spond to just one host. It
can respond to a large collection of hosts that are being
treated identically.</p>

<p>Each line of the file contains a path name, a client
name, and a number of options in parentheses. Any space,
tab, newline or back-slash character in the path name or
client name will be replaced by a backslash followed by the
octal ASCII code for that character.</p>

<p>threads This file represents the number of nfsd thread
currently run- ning. Reading it will show the number of
threads. Writing an ASCII decimal number will cause the
number of threads to be changed (increased or decreased as
necessary) to achieve that number.</p>

<p>filehandle This is a somewhat unusual file in that what
is read from it depends on what was just written to it. It
provides a transac- tional interface where a program can
open the file, write a request, and read a response. If two
separate programs open, write, and read at the same time,
their requests will not be mixed up.</p>

<p>The request written to filehandle should be a client
name, a path name, and a number of bytes. This should be
followed by a newline, with white-space separating the
fields, and octal quot- ing of special characters.</p>

<p>On writing this, the program will be able to read back a
file- handle for that path as exported to the given client.
The file- handles length will be at most the number of bytes
given.</p>

<p>The filehandle will be represented in hex with a leading
The directory /proc/net/rpc in the procfs filesystem
contains a number of files and directories. The files
contain statistics that can be display using the nfsstat
program. The directories contain information about various
caches that the NFS server maintains to keep track of access
permissions that different clients have for different
filesys- tems. The caches are:</p>

<p>auth.domain This cache maps the name of a client (or
domain) to an internal data structure. The only access that
is possible is to flush the cache.</p>

<p>auth.unix.ip This cache contains a mapping from IP
address to the name of the authentication domain that the
ipaddress should be treated as part of.</p>

<p>nfsd.export This cache contains a mapping from directory
and domain to export options.</p>

<p>nfsd.fh This cache contains a mapping from domain and a
filesystem iden- tifier to a directory. The filesystem
identifier is stored in the filehandles and consists of a
number indicating the type of identifier and a number of hex
bytes indicating the content of the identifier.</p>

<p>Each directory representing a cache can hold from 1 to 3
files. They are:</p>

<p>flush When a number of seconds since epoch (1 Jan 1970)
is written to this file, all entries in the cache that were
last updated before that file become invalidated and will be
flushed out. Writing 1 will flush everything. This is the
only file that will always be present.</p>

<p>content This file, if present, contains a textual
representation of ever entry in the cache, one per line. If
an entry is still in the cache (because it is actively being
used) but has expired or is otherwise invalid, it will be
presented as a comment (with a leading hash character).</p>

<p>channel This file, if present, acts a channel for
request from the ker- nel-based nfs server to be passed to a
user-space program for handling.</p>

<p>When the kernel needs some information which isnt in the
cache, it makes a line appear in the channel file giving the
key for the information. A user-space program should read
this, find the answer, and write a line containing the key,
an expiry time, and the content. For example the kernel
might make nfsd 127.0.0.1 appear in the auth.unix.ip/content
file. The user-space program might then write nfsd 127.0.0.1
1057206953 localhost to indicate that 127.0.0.1 should map
to localhost, atleast for now.</p>

<p>If the program uses select(2) or poll(2) to discover if
it can read from the channel then it will never see and
end-of-file but when all requests have been answered, it
will block until another request appears.</p>

<p>In the /proc filesystem there are 4 files that can be
used to enabled extra tracing of nfsd and related code. They
are: /proc/sys/sunrpc/nfs_debug /proc/sys/sunrpc/nfsd_debug
/proc/sys/sunrpc/nlm_debug /proc/sys/sunrpc/rpc_debug They
control tracing for the NFS client, the NFS server, the
Network Lock Manager (lockd) and the underlying RPC layer
respectively. Deci- mal numbers can be read from or written
to these files. Each number represents a bit-pattern where
bits that are set cause certain classes of tracing to be
enabled. Consult the kernel header files to find out what
number correspond to what tracing.</p>
