<p>BASENAME(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual BASENAME(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME basename - return non-directory portion of a
pathname</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS basename string [suffix]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The string operand shall be treated as a
pathname, as defined in the Base Definitions volume of IEEE
Std 1003.1-2001, Section 3.266, Path- name. The string
string shall be converted to the filename correspond- ing to
the last pathname component in string and then the suffix
string suffix, if present, shall be removed. This shall be
done by performing actions equivalent to the following steps
in order:</p>

<p>1. If string is a null string, it is unspecified whether
the resulting string is.or a null string. In either case,
skip steps 2 through 6.</p>

<p>2. If string is &quot;//&quot;, it is
implementation-defined whether steps 3 to 6 are skipped or
processed.</p>

<p>3. If string consists entirely of slash characters,
string shall be set to a single slash character. In this
case, skip steps 4 to 6.</p>

<p>4. If there are any trailing slash characters in string,
they shall be removed.</p>

<p>5. If there are any slash characters remaining in
string, the prefix of string up to and including the last
slash character in string shall be removed.</p>

<p>6. If the suffix operand is present, is not identical to
the charac- ters remaining in string, and is identical to a
suffix of the char- acters remaining in string, the suffix
suffix shall be removed from string. Otherwise, string is
not modified by this step. It shall not be considered an
error if suffix is not found in string.</p>

<p>The resulting string shall be written to standard
output.</p>

<p>OPTIONS None.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operands shall be supported:</p>

<p>string A string.</p>

<p>suffix A string.</p>

<p>STDIN Not used.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of base- name:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in
arguments).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT The basename utility shall write a line to the
standard output in the following format:</p>

<p>&quot;%n&quot;, &lt;resulting string&gt;</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 Successful completion.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The definition of pathname specifies
implementation-defined behavior for pathnames starting with
two slash characters. Therefore, applications shall not
arbitrarily add slashes to the beginning of a pathname
unless they can ensure that there are more or less than two
or are prepared to deal with the implementation-defined
consequences.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES If the string string is a valid pathname:</p>

<p>$(basename &quot;string&quot;)</p>

<p>produces a filename that could be used to open the file
named by string in the directory returned by:</p>

<p>$(dirname &quot;string&quot;)</p>

<p>If the string string is not a valid pathname, the same
algorithm is used, but the result need not be a valid
filename. The basename util- ity is not expected to make any
judgements about the validity of string as a pathname; it
just follows the specified algorithm to produce a result
string.</p>

<p>The following shell script compiles /usr/src/cmd/cat.c
and moves the output to a file named cat in the current
directory when invoked with the argument /usr/src/cmd/cat or
with the argument /usr/src/cmd/cat.c:</p>

<p>c99 $(dirname &quot;$1&quot;)/$(basename &quot;$1&quot;
.c).c mv a.out $(basename &quot;$1&quot; .c)</p>

<p>RATIONALE The behaviors of basename and dirname have
been coordinated so that when string is a valid
pathname:</p>

<p>$(basename &quot;string&quot;)</p>

<p>would be a valid filename for the file in the
directory:</p>

<p>$(dirname &quot;string&quot;)</p>

<p>This would not work for the early proposal versions of
these utilities due to the way it specified handling of
trailing slashes.</p>

<p>Since the definition of pathname specifies
implementation-defined behavior for pathnames starting with
two slash characters, this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001
specifies similar implementation-defined behav- ior for the
basename and dirname utilities.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
