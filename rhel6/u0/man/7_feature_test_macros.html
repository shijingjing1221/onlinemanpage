<p>FEATURE_TEST_MACROS(7) Linux Programmer s Manual
FEATURE_TEST_MACROS(7)</p>

<p>NAME feature_test_macros - feature test macros</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;features.h&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Feature test macros allow the programmer to
control the definitions that are exposed by system header
files when a program is compiled. This can be useful for
creating portable applications, by preventing non-standard
definitions from being exposed. Other macros can be used to
expose non-standard definitions that are not exposed by
default. The precise effects of each of the feature test
macros described below can be ascertained by inspecting the
&lt;features.h&gt; header file.</p>

<p>In order to be effective, a feature test macro must be
defined before including any header files. This can either
be done in the compilation command (cc -DMACRO=value) or by
defining the macro within the source code before including
any headers.</p>

<p>Specification of feature test macro requirements in
manual pages When a function requires that a feature test
macro is defined, the man- ual page SYNOPSIS typically
includes a note of the following form (this example from the
chmod(2) manual page):</p>

<p>#include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;</p>

<p>int chmod(const char *path, mode_t mode); int fchmod(int
fd, mode_t mode);</p>

<p>Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see fea-
ture_test_macros(7)):</p>

<p>fchmod(): _BSD_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;= 500</p>

<p>The || means that in order to obtain the declaration of
fchmod(2) from &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;, either of the following
macro definitions must be made before including any header
files:</p>

<p>#define _BSD_SOURCE #define _XOPEN_SOURCE 500 /* or any
value &gt; 500 */</p>

<p>Alternatively, equivalent definitions can be included in
the compila- tion command:</p>

<p>cc -D_BSD_SOURCE cc -D_XOPEN_SOURCE=500 # Or any value
&gt; 500</p>

<p>Note that, as described below, some feature test macros
are defined by default, so that it may not always be
necessary to explicitly specify the feature test macro(s)
shown in the SYNOPSIS.</p>

<p>In a few cases, manual pages use a shorthand for
expressing the feature test macro requirements (this example
from readahead(2)):</p>

<p>#define _GNU_SOURCE #include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;</p>

<p>ssize_t readahead(int fd, off64_t *offset, size_t
count);</p>

<p>This format is employed in cases where only a single
feature test macro can be used to expose the function
declaration, and that macro is not defined by default.</p>

<p>Feature test macros understood by glibc The following
paragraphs explain how feature test macros are handled in
Linux glibc 2.x, x &gt; 0.</p>

<p>Linux glibc understands the following feature test
macros:</p>

<p>__STRICT_ANSI__ ISO Standard C. This macro is implicitly
defined by gcc(1) when invoked with, for example, the
-std=c99 or -ansi flag.</p>

<p>_POSIX_C_SOURCE Defining this macro causes header files
to expose definitions as follows:</p>

<p>&middot; The value 1 exposes definitions conforming to
POSIX.1-1990 and ISO C (1990).</p>

<p>&middot; The value 2 or greater additionally exposes
definitions for POSIX.2-1992.</p>

<p>&middot; The value 199309L or greater additionally
exposes definitions for POSIX.1b (real-time extensions).</p>

<p>&middot; The value 199506L or greater additionally
exposes definitions for POSIX.1c (threads).</p>

<p>&middot; (Since glibc 2.3.3) The value 200112L or
greater exposes def- initions corresponding to the
POSIX.1-2001 base specification (excluding the XSI
extension).</p>

<p>&middot; (Since glibc 2.10) The value 200809L or greater
exposes defi- nitions corresponding to the POSIX.1-2008 base
specification (excluding the XSI extension).</p>

<p>_POSIX_SOURCE Defining this obsolete macro with any
value is equivalent to defining _POSIX_C_SOURCE with the
value 1.</p>

<p>_XOPEN_SOURCE Defining this macro causes header files to
expose definitions as follows:</p>

<p>&middot; Defining with any value exposes definitions
conforming to POSIX.1, POSIX.2, and XPG4.</p>

<p>&middot; The value 500 or greater additionally exposes
definitions for SUSv2 (UNIX 98).</p>

<p>&middot; (Since glibc 2.2) The value 600 or greater
additionally exposes definitions for SUSv3 (UNIX 03; i.e.,
the POSIX.1-2001 base specification plus the XSI extension)
and C99 definitions.</p>

<p>&middot; (Since glibc 2.10) The value 700 or greater
additionally exposes definitions for SUSv4 (i.e., the
POSIX.1-2008 base specification plus the XSI extension).</p>

<p>_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED If this macro is defined, and
_XOPEN_SOURCE is defined, then expose definitions
corresponding to the XPG4v2 (SUSv1) UNIX extensions (UNIX
95). This macro is also implicitly defined if _XOPEN_SOURCE
is defined with a value of 500 or more.</p>

<p>_ISOC99_SOURCE Exposes C99 extensions to ISO C (1990).
This macro is recog- nized since glibc 2.1.3; earlier glibc
2.1.x versions recognized an equivalent macro named
_ISOC9X_SOURCE (because the C99 stan- dard had not then been
finalized). Although the use of the lat- ter macro is
obsolete, glibc continues to recognize it for back- wards
compatibility.</p>

<p>_LARGEFILE64_SOURCE Expose definitions for the
alternative API specified by the LFS (Large File Summit) as
a &quot;transitional extension&quot; to the Single UNIX
Specification. (See http://opengroup.org/plat-
form/lfs.html.) The alternative API consists of a set of new
objects (i.e., functions and types) whose names are suffixed
with &quot;64&quot; (e.g., off64_t versus off_t, lseek64()
versus lseek(), etc.). New programs should not employ this
interface; instead _FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 should be
employed.</p>

<p>_FILE_OFFSET_BITS Defining this macro with the value 64
automatically converts references to 32-bit functions and
data types related to file I/O and file system operations
into references to their 64-bit counterparts. This is useful
for performing I/O on large files (&gt; 2 Gigabytes) on
32-bit systems. (Defining this macro permits correctly
written programs to use large files with only a recom-
pilation being required.) 64-bit systems naturally permit
file sizes greater than 2 Gigabytes, and on those systems
this macro has no effect.</p>

<p>_BSD_SOURCE Defining this macro with any value causes
header files to expose BSD-derived definitions. Defining
this macro also causes BSD definitions to be preferred in
some situations where standards conflict, unless one or more
of _SVID_SOURCE, _POSIX_SOURCE, _POSIX_C_SOURCE,
_XOPEN_SOURCE, _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED, or _GNU_SOURCE is
defined, in which case BSD definitions are disfa- vored.</p>

<p>_SVID_SOURCE Defining this macro with any value causes
header files to expose System V-derived definitions. (SVID
== System V Interface Defi- nition; see standards(7).)</p>

<p>_ATFILE_SOURCE (since glibc 2.4) Defining this macro
with any value causes header files to expose declarations of
a range of functions with the suffix &quot;at&quot;; see
openat(2).</p>

<p>_GNU_SOURCE Defining this macro (with any value) is
equivalent to defining _BSD_SOURCE, _SVID_SOURCE,
_ATFILE_SOURCE, _LARGEFILE64_SOURCE, _ISOC99_SOURCE,
_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED, _POSIX_SOURCE, _POSIX_C_SOURCE with
the value 200809L (200112L in glibc ver- sions before 2.10;
199506L in glibc versions before 2.5; 199309L in glibc
versions before 2.1) and _XOPEN_SOURCE with the value 700
(600 in glibc versions before 2.10; 500 in glibc versions
before 2.2). In addition, various GNU-specific extensions
are also exposed. Where standards conflict, BSD definitions
are disfavored.</p>

<p>_REENTRANT Defining this macro exposes definitions of
certain reentrant functions. For multithreaded programs, use
cc -pthread instead.</p>

<p>_THREAD_SAFE Synonym for _REENTRANT, provided for
compatibility with some other implementations.</p>

<p>_FORTIFY_SOURCE (since glibc 2.3.4) Defining this macro
causes some lightweight checks to be per- formed to detect
some buffer overflow errors when employing various string
and memory manipulation functions. Not all buffer overflows
are detected, just some common cases. In the current
implementation checks are added for calls to memcpy(3),
mempcpy(3), memmove(3), memset(3), stpcpy(3), strcpy(3),
strncpy(3), strcat(3), strncat(3), sprintf(3), snprintf(3),
vsprintf(3), vsnprintf(3), and gets(3). If _FORTIFY_SOURCE
is set to 1, with compiler optimization level 1 (gcc -O1)
and above, checks that shouldnt change the behavior of
conforming programs are performed. With _FORTIFY_SOURCE set
to 2 some more checking is added, but some conforming
programs might fail. Some of the checks can be performed at
compile time, and result in compiler warnings; other checks
take place at run time, and result in a run-time error if
the check fails. Use of this macro requires compiler
support, available with gcc(1) since version 4.0.</p>

<p>Default definitions, implicit definitions, and combining
definitions If no feature test macros are explicitly
defined, then the following feature test macros are defined
by default: _BSD_SOURCE, _SVID_SOURCE, _POSIX_SOURCE, and
_POSIX_C_SOURCE=200909L (200112L in glibc versions before
2.10; 199506L in glibc versions before 2.4; 199309L in glibc
versions before 2.1).</p>

<p>If any of __STRICT_ANSI__, _ISOC99_SOURCE,
_POSIX_SOURCE, _POSIX_C_SOURCE, _XOPEN_SOURCE,
_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED, _BSD_SOURCE, or _SVID_SOURCE is
explicitly defined, then _BSD_SOURCE, and _SVID_SOURCE are
not defined by default.</p>

<p>If _POSIX_SOURCE and _POSIX_C_SOURCE are not explicitly
defined, and either __STRICT_ANSI__ is not defined or
_XOPEN_SOURCE is defined with a value of 500 or more,
then</p>

<p>* _POSIX_SOURCE is defined with the value 1; and</p>

<p>* _POSIX_C_SOURCE is defined with one of the following
values:</p>

<p>&middot; 2, if XOPEN_SOURCE is defined with a value less
than 500;</p>

<p>&middot; 199506L, if XOPEN_SOURCE is defined with a
value greater than or equal to 500 and less than 600; or</p>

<p>&middot; (since glibc 2.4) 200112L, if XOPEN_SOURCE is
defined with a value greater than or equal to 600 and less
than 700.</p>

<p>&middot; (Since glibc 2.10) 200809L, if XOPEN_SOURCE is
defined with a value greater than or equal to 700.</p>

<p>&middot; Older versions of glibc do not know about the
values 2001212L and 200809L for _POSIX_C_SOURCE, and the
setting of this macro will depend on the glibc version.</p>

<p>&middot; If _XOPEN_SOURCE is undefined, then the setting
of _POSIX_C_SOURCE depends on the glibc version: 199506L, in
glibc versions before 2.4; 200112L, in glibc 2.4 to 2.9; and
200809L, since glibc 2.10.</p>

<p>Multiple macros can be defined; the results are
additive.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO POSIX.1 specifies _POSIX_C_SOURCE,
_POSIX_SOURCE, and _XOPEN_SOURCE. _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED was
specified by XPG4v2 (aka SUSv1).</p>

<p>_FILE_OFFSET_BITS is not specified by any standard, but
is employed on some other implementations.</p>

<p>_BSD_SOURCE, _SVID_SOURCE, _ATFILE_SOURCE, _GNU_SOURCE,
_FOR- TIFY_SOURCE, _REENTRANT, and _THREAD_SAFE are specific
to Linux (glibc).</p>

<p>NOTES &lt;features.h&gt; is a Linux/glibc-specific
header file. Other systems have an analogous file, but
typically with a different name. This header file is
automatically included by other header files as required: it
is not necessary to explicitly include it in order to employ
feature test macros.</p>

<p>According to which of the above feature test macros are
defined, &lt;fea- tures.h&gt; internally defines various
other macros that are checked by other glibc header files.
These macros have names prefixed by two underscores (e.g.,
__USE_MISC). Programs should never define these macros
directly: instead, the appropriate feature test macro(s)
from the list above should be employed.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE The program below can be used to explore how the
various feature test macros are set depending on the glibc
version and what feature test macros are explicitly set. The
following shell session, on a system with glibc 2.10, shows
some examples of what we would see:</p>
