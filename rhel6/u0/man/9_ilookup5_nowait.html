<p>ILOOKUP5_NOWAIT(9) The Linux VFS ILOOKUP5_NOWAIT(9)</p>

<p>NAME ilookup5_nowait - search for an inode in the inode
cache</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS struct inode * ilookup5_nowait(struct
super_block * sb, unsigned long hashval, int (*test) (struct
inode *, void *), void * data);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS sb super block of file system to search</p>

<p>hashval hash value (usually inode number) to search
for</p>

<p>test callback used for comparisons between inodes</p>

<p>data opaque data pointer to pass to test</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION ilookup5 uses ifind to search for the inode
specified by hashval and data in the inode cache. This is a
generalized version of ilookup for file systems where the
inode number is not sufficient for unique identification of
an inode.</p>

<p>If the inode is in the cache, the inode is returned with
an incremented reference count. Note, the inode lock is not
waited upon so you have to be very careful what you do with
the returned inode. You probably should be using ilookup5
instead.</p>

<p>Otherwise NULL is returned.</p>

<p>Note, test is called with the inode_lock held, so
can&acute;t sleep.</p>
