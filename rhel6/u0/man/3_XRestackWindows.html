<p>XRaiseWindow(3) XLIB FUNCTIONS XRaiseWindow(3)</p>

<p>NAME XRaiseWindow, XLowerWindow, XCirculateSubwindows,
XCirculateSubwindow- sUp, XCirculateSubwindowsDown,
XRestackWindows - change window stacking order</p>

<p>SYNTAX int XRaiseWindow(Display *display, Window w);</p>

<p>int XLowerWindow(Display *display, Window w);</p>

<p>int XCirculateSubwindows(Display *display, Window w, int
direction);</p>

<p>int XCirculateSubwindowsUp(Display *display, Window
w);</p>

<p>int XCirculateSubwindowsDown(Display *display, Window
w);</p>

<p>int XRestackWindows(Display *display, Window windows[],
int nwindows);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS direction Specifies the direction (up or down)
that you want to circu- late the window. You can pass
RaiseLowest or LowerHighest.</p>

<p>display Specifies the connection to the X server.</p>

<p>nwindows Specifies the number of windows to be
restacked.</p>

<p>w Specifies the window.</p>

<p>windows Specifies an array containing the windows to be
restacked.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The XRaiseWindow function raises the
specified window to the top of the stack so that no sibling
window obscures it. If the windows are regarded as
overlapping sheets of paper stacked on a desk, then raising
a window is analogous to moving the sheet to the top of the
stack but leaving its x and y location on the desk constant.
Raising a mapped window may generate Expose events for the
window and any mapped subwin- dows that were formerly
obscured.</p>

<p>If the override-redirect attribute of the window is
False and some other client has selected
SubstructureRedirectMask on the parent, the X server
generates a ConfigureRequest event, and no processing is
per- formed. Otherwise, the window is raised.</p>

<p>XRaiseWindow can generate a BadWindow error.</p>

<p>The XLowerWindow function lowers the specified window to
the bottom of the stack so that it does not obscure any
sibling windows. If the win- dows are regarded as
overlapping sheets of paper stacked on a desk, then lowering
a window is analogous to moving the sheet to the bottom of
the stack but leaving its x and y location on the desk
constant. Lowering a mapped window will generate Expose
events on any windows it formerly obscured.</p>

<p>If the override-redirect attribute of the window is
False and some other client has selected
SubstructureRedirectMask on the parent, the X server
generates a ConfigureRequest event, and no processing is
per- formed. Otherwise, the window is lowered to the bottom
of the stack.</p>

<p>XLowerWindow can generate a BadWindow error.</p>

<p>The XCirculateSubwindows function circulates children of
the specified window in the specified direction. If you
specify RaiseLowest, XCircu- lateSubwindows raises the
lowest mapped child (if any) that is occluded by another
child to the top of the stack. If you specify LowerHighest,
XCirculateSubwindows lowers the highest mapped child (if
any) that occludes another child to the bottom of the stack.
Exposure processing is then performed on formerly obscured
windows. If some other client has selected
SubstructureRedirectMask on the window, the X server gen-
erates a CirculateRequest event, and no further processing
is per- formed. If a child is actually restacked, the X
server generates a CirculateNotify event.</p>

<p>XCirculateSubwindows can generate BadValue and BadWindow
errors.</p>

<p>The XCirculateSubwindowsUp function raises the lowest
mapped child of the specified window that is partially or
completely occluded by another child. Completely unobscured
children are not affected. This is a convenience function
equivalent to XCirculateSubwindows with RaiseLowest
specified.</p>

<p>XCirculateSubwindowsUp can generate a BadWindow
error.</p>

<p>The XCirculateSubwindowsDown function lowers the highest
mapped child of the specified window that partially or
completely occludes another child. Completely unobscured
children are not affected. This is a convenience function
equivalent to XCirculateSubwindows with LowerHigh- est
specified.</p>

<p>XCirculateSubwindowsDown can generate a BadWindow
error.</p>

<p>The XRestackWindows function restacks the windows in the
order speci- fied, from top to bottom. The stacking order of
the first window in the windows array is unaffected, but the
other windows in the array are stacked underneath the first
window, in the order of the array. The stacking order of the
other windows is not affected. For each window in the window
array that is not a child of the specified window, a Bad-
Match error results.</p>

<p>If the override-redirect attribute of a window is False
and some other client has selected SubstructureRedirectMask
on the parent, the X server generates ConfigureRequest
events for each window whose over- ride-redirect flag is not
set, and no further processing is performed. Otherwise, the
windows will be restacked in top-to-bottom order.</p>

<p>XRestackWindows can generate BadWindow error.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS BadValue Some numeric value falls outside
the range of values accepted by the request. Unless a
specific range is specified for an argument, the full range
defined by the argument s type is accepted. Any argument
defined as a set of alternatives can generate this
error.</p>

<p>BadWindow A value for a Window argument does not name a
defined Window.</p>
