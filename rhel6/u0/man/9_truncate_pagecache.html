<p>TRUNCATE_PAGECACHE(9) Memory Management in Linux
TRUNCATE_PAGECACHE(9)</p>

<p>NAME truncate_pagecache - unmap and remove pagecache
that has been truncated</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS void truncate_pagecache(struct inode * inode,
loff_t old, loff_t new);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS inode inode</p>

<p>old old file offset</p>

<p>new new file offset</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION inode&acute;s new i_size must already be
written before truncate_pagecache is called.</p>

<p>This function should typically be called before the
filesystem releases resources associated with the freed
range (eg. deallocates blocks). This way, pagecache will
always stay logically coherent with on-disk format, and the
filesystem would not have to deal with situations such as
writepage being called for a page that has already had its
underlying blocks deallocated.</p>
