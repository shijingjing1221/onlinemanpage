<p>NAME ldrdf - link RDOFF objects and libraries produced
by rdflib(1)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ldrdf [-o output-file] object-file...
[-llibrary...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION ldrdf is a version of unix ld(1) (or DOS
LINK) for use with RDOFF files. It is capable of linking
RDOFF objects, and libraries produced with the rdflib(1)
utility.</p>

<p>Libraries must be specified with their path as no search
is performed. Modules in libraries are not linked to the
program unless they are referred to.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -o output-file Specify an output file. The
default output filename is aout.rdx.</p>

<p>-v Increase verbosity level. Currently 4 verbosity
levels are available: default (which only prints error
information), normal (which prints information about the
produced object, -v), medium (which prints information about
what the program is doing, -v -v) and high (which prints all
available information, -v -v -v).</p>

<p>-p Change alignment value to which multiple segments
combigned into a single segment should be aligned (must be
either 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 or 256; default is 16).</p>
