<p>XtCreateWidget(3) XT FUNCTIONS XtCreateWidget(3)</p>

<p>NAME XtCreateWidget, XtVaCreateWidget,
XtCreateManagedWidget, XtVaCreate- ManagedWidget,
XtDestroyWidget - create and destroy widgets</p>

<p>SYNTAX Widget XtCreateWidget(String name, WidgetClass
widget_class, Widget parent, ArgList args, Cardinal
num_args);</p>

<p>Widget XtVaCreateWidget(String name, WidgetClass
widget_class, Widget parent, ...);</p>

<p>Widget XtCreateManagedWidget(String name, WidgetClass
widget_class, Widget parent, ArgList args, Cardinal
num_args);</p>

<p>Widget XtVaCreateManagedWidget(String name, WidgetClass
widget_class, Widget parent, ...);</p>

<p>void XtDestroyWidget(Widget w);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS args Specifies the argument list to override
the resource defaults.</p>

<p>name Specifies the resource name for the created widget,
which is used for retrieving resources and, for that reason,
should not be the same as any other widget that is a child
of same parent.</p>

<p>num_args Specifies the number of arguments in the
argument list.</p>

<p>parent Specifies the parent widget.</p>

<p>w Specifies the widget.</p>

<p>widget_class Specifies the widget class pointer for the
created widget.</p>

<p>... Specifies the variable argument list to override the
resource defaults.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The XtCreateWidget function performs much of
the boilerplate operations of widget creation:</p>

<p>&middot; Checks to see if the class_initialize procedure
has been called for this class and for all superclasses and,
if not, calls those necessary in a superclass-to-subclass
order.</p>

<p>&middot; Allocates memory for the widget instance.</p>

<p>&middot; If the parent is a subclass of
constraintWidgetClass, it allocates memory for the parent s
constraints and stores the address of this memory into the
constraints field.</p>

<p>&middot; Initializes the core nonresource data fields
(for example, parent and visible).</p>

<p>&middot; Initializes the resource fields (for example,
background_pixel) by using the resource lists specified for
this class and all super- classes.</p>

<p>&middot; If the parent is a subclass of
constraintWidgetClass, it initial- izes the resource fields
of the constraints record by using the constraint resource
list specified for the parents class and all superclasses up
to constraintWidgetClass.</p>

<p>&middot; Calls the initialize procedures for the widget
by starting at the Core initialize procedure on down to the
widgets initialize pro- cedure.</p>

<p>&middot; If the parent is a subclass of
compositeWidgetClass, it puts the widget into its parents
children list by calling its parents insert_child procedure.
For further information, see Section 3.5.</p>

<p>&middot; If the parent is a subclass of
constraintWidgetClass, it calls the constraint initialize
procedures, starting at constraintWidget- Class on down to
the parents constraint initialize procedure.</p>

<p>Note that you can determine the number of arguments in
an argument list by using the XtNumber macro. For further
information, see Section 11.1.</p>

<p>The XtCreateManagedWidget function is a convenience
routine that calls XtCreateWidget and XtManageChild.</p>

<p>The XtDestroyWidget function provides the only method of
destroying a widget, including widgets that need to destroy
themselves. It can be called at any time, including from an
application callback routine of the widget being destroyed.
This requires a two-phase destroy process in order to avoid
dangling references to destroyed widgets.</p>

<p>In phase one, XtDestroyWidget performs the
following:</p>

<p>&middot; If the being_destroyed field of the widget is
True, it returns immediately.</p>

<p>&middot; Recursively descends the widget tree and sets
the being_destroyed field to True for the widget and all
children.</p>

<p>&middot; Adds the widget to a list of widgets (the
destroy list) that should be destroyed when it is safe to do
so.</p>

<p>Entries on the destroy list satisfy the invariant that
if w2 occurs after w1 on the destroy list then w2 is not a
descendent of w1. (A descendant refers to both normal and
pop-up children.)</p>

<p>Phase two occurs when all procedures that should execute
as a result of the current event have been called (including
all procedures registered with the event and translation
managers), that is, when the current invocation of
XtDispatchEvent is about to return or immediately if not in
XtDispatchEvent.</p>

<p>In phase two, XtDestroyWidget performs the following on
each entry in the destroy list:</p>

<p>&middot; Calls the destroy callback procedures
registered on the widget (and all descendants) in post-order
(it calls children callbacks before parent callbacks).</p>

<p>&middot; If the widget s parent is a subclass of
compositeWidgetClass and if the parent is not being
destroyed, it calls XtUnmanageChild on the widget and then
calls the widget s parent s delete_child pro- cedure (see
Section 3.4).</p>

<p>&middot; If the widget s parent is a subclass of
constraintWidgetClass, it calls the constraint destroy
procedure for the parent, then the parent s superclass,
until finally it calls the constraint destroy procedure for
constraintWidgetClass.</p>

<p>&middot; Calls the destroy methods for the widget (and
all descendants) in post-order. For each such widget, it
calls the destroy procedure declared in the widget class,
then the destroy procedure declared in its superclass, until
finally it calls the destroy procedure declared in the Core
class record.</p>

<p>&middot; Calls XDestroyWindow if the widget is realized
(that is, has an X window). The server recursively destroys
all descendant windows.</p>

<p>&middot; Recursively descends the tree and deallocates
all pop-up widgets, constraint records, callback lists and,
if the widget is a sub- class of compositeWidgetClass,
children.</p>
