<p>MKFIFOAT(3) Linux Programmer s Manual MKFIFOAT(3)</p>

<p>NAME mkfifoat - make a FIFO (named pipe) relative to a
directory file descriptor</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #define _ATFILE_SOURCE #include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;
/* Definition of AT_* constants */ #include
&lt;sys/stat.h&gt;</p>

<p>int mkfifoat(int dirfd, const char *pathname, mode_t
mode);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The mkfifoat() system call operates in
exactly the same way as mkfifo(3), except for the
differences described in this manual page.</p>

<p>If the pathname given in pathname is relative, then it
is interpreted relative to the directory referred to by the
file descriptor dirfd (rather than relative to the current
working directory of the calling process, as is done by
mkfifo(3) for a relative pathname).</p>

<p>If pathname is relative and dirfd is the special value
AT_FDCWD, then pathname is interpreted relative to the
current working directory of the calling process (like
mkfifo(3)).</p>

<p>If pathname is absolute, then dirfd is ignored.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, mkfifoat() returns 0. On error,
-1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The same errors that occur for mkfifo(3) can also
occur for mkfifoat(). The following additional errors can
occur for mkfifoat():</p>

<p>EBADF dirfd is not a valid file descriptor.</p>

<p>ENOTDIR pathname is a relative path and dirfd is a file
descriptor referring to a file other than a directory.</p>

<p>VERSIONS mkfifoat() was added to glibc in version 2.4.
It is implemented using mknod(2), available on Linux since
kernel 2.6.16.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO POSIX.1-2008.</p>

<p>NOTES See openat(2) for an explanation of the need for
mkfifoat().</p>
