<p>OCF_HEARTBEAT_FILESY(7) OCF resource agents
OCF_HEARTBEAT_FILESY(7)</p>

<p>NAME ocf_heartbeat_Filesystem - Manages filesystem
mounts</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS Filesystem [start | stop | notify | monitor |
validate-all | meta-data]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Resource script for Filesystem. It manages a
Filesystem on a shared storage medium. The standard monitor
operation of depth 0 (also known as probe) checks if the
filesystem is mounted. If you want deeper tests, set
OCF_CHECK_LEVEL to one of the following values: 10: read
first 16 blocks of the device (raw read) This doesn&acute;t
exercise the filesystem at all, but the device on which the
filesystem lives. This is noop for non-block devices such as
NFS, SMBFS, or bind mounts. 20: test if a status file can be
written and read The status file must be writable by root.
This is not always the case with an NFS mount, as NFS
exports usually have the &quot;root_squash&quot; option set.
In such a setup, you must either use read-only monitoring
(depth=10), export with &quot;no_root_squash&quot; on your
NFS server, or grant world write permissions on the
directory where the status file is to be placed.</p>

<p>SUPPORTED PARAMETERS device The name of block device for
the filesystem, or -U, -L options for mount, or NFS mount
specification. (required, string, no default)</p>

<p>directory The mount point for the filesystem. (required,
string, no default)</p>

<p>fstype The optional type of filesystem to be mounted.
(required, string, no default)</p>

<p>options Any extra options to be given as -o options to
mount. For bind mounts, add &quot;bind&quot; here and set
fstype to &quot;none&quot;. We will do the right thing for
options such as &quot;bind,ro&quot;. (optional, string, no
default)</p>

<p>statusfile_prefix The prefix to be used for a status
file for resource monitoring with depth 20. If you
don&acute;t specify this parameter, all status files will be
created in a separate directory. (optional, string, default
.Filesystem_status/)</p>

<p>SUPPORTED ACTIONS This resource agent supports the
following actions (operations):</p>

<p>start Starts the resource. Suggested minimum timeout:
60.</p>

<p>stop Stops the resource. Suggested minimum timeout:
60.</p>

<p>notify Suggested minimum timeout: 60.</p>

<p>monitor Performs a detailed status check. Suggested
minimum timeout: 40. Suggested interval: 20.</p>

<p>validate-all Performs a validation of the resource
configuration. Suggested minimum timeout: 5.</p>

<p>meta-data Retrieves resource agent metadata (internal
use only). Suggested minimum timeout: 5.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE The following is an example configuration for a
Filesystem resource using the crm(8) shell:</p>

<p>primitive example_Filesystem ocf:heartbeat:Filesystem
params device=string directory=string fstype=string op
monitor depth=&quot;0&quot; timeout=&quot;40&quot;
interval=&quot;20&quot;</p>
