<p>NAME eventlogadm - push records into the Samba event log
store</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS eventlogadm [-d] [-h] -o addsource EVENTLOG
SOURCENAME MSGFILE</p>

<p>eventlogadm [-d] [-h] -o write EVENTLOG</p>

<p>eventlogadm [-d] [-h] -o dump EVENTLOG RECORD_NUMBER</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This tool is part of the samba(1) suite.</p>

<p>eventlogadm is a filter that accepts formatted event log
records on standard input and writes them to the Samba event
log store. Windows client can then manipulate these record
using the usual administration tools.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -d The -d option causes eventlogadm to emit
debugging information.</p>

<p>-o addsource EVENTLOG SOURCENAME MSGFILE The -o
addsource option creates a new event log source.</p>

<p>-o write EVENTLOG The -o write reads event log records
from standard input and writes them to the Samba event log
store named by EVENTLOG.</p>

<p>-o dump EVENTLOG RECORD_NUMBER The -o dump reads event
log records from a EVENTLOG tdb and dumps them to standard
output on screen.</p>

<p>-h Print usage information.</p>

<p>EVENTLOG RECORD FORMAT For the write operation,
eventlogadm expects to be able to read structured records
from standard input. These records are a sequence of lines,
with the record key and data separated by a colon character.
Records are separated by at least one or more blank
line.</p>

<p>The event log record field are:</p>

<p>&middot; LEN - This field should be 0, since eventlogadm
will calculate this value.</p>

<p>&middot; RS1 - This must be the value 1699505740.</p>

<p>&middot; RCN - This field should be 0.</p>

<p>&middot; TMG - The time the eventlog record was
generated; format is the number of seconds since 00:00:00
January 1, 1970, UTC.</p>

<p>&middot; TMW - The time the eventlog record was written;
format is the number of seconds since 00:00:00 January 1,
1970, UTC.</p>

<p>&middot; EID - The eventlog ID.</p>

<p>&middot; ETP - The event type -- one of
&quot;INFO&quot;, &quot;ERROR&quot;, &quot;WARNING&quot;,
&quot;AUDIT SUCCESS&quot; or &quot;AUDIT FAILURE&quot;.</p>

<p>&middot; ECT - The event category; this depends on the
message file. It is primarily used as a means of filtering
in the eventlog viewer.</p>

<p>&middot; RS2 - This field should be 0.</p>

<p>&middot; CRN - This field should be 0.</p>

<p>&middot; USL - This field should be 0.</p>

<p>&middot; SRC - This field contains the source name
associated with the event log. If a message file is used
with an event log, there will be a registry entry for
associating this source name with a message file DLL.</p>

<p>&middot; SRN - The name of the machine on which the
eventlog was generated. This is typically the host name.</p>

<p>&middot; STR - The text associated with the eventlog.
There may be more than one string in a record.</p>

<p>&middot; DAT - This field should be left unset.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES An example of the record format accepted by
eventlogadm:</p>

<p>LEN: 0 RS1: 1699505740 RCN: 0 TMG: 1128631322 TMW:
1128631322 EID: 1000 ETP: INFO ECT: 0 RS2: 0 CRN: 0 USL: 0
SRC: cron SRN: dmlinux STR: (root) CMD ( rm -f
/var/spool/cron/lastrun/cron.hourly) DAT:</p>

<p>Set up an eventlog source, specifying a message file
DLL:</p>

<p>eventlogadm -o addsource Application MyApplication | \
%SystemRoot%/system32/MyApplication.dll</p>

<p>Filter messages from the system log into an event
log:</p>

<p>tail -f /var/log/messages | \
my_program_to_parse_into_eventlog_records | \ eventlogadm
SystemLogEvents</p>
