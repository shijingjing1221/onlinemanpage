<p>GIT(1) Git Manual GIT(1)</p>

<p>NAME git - the stupid content tracker</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS git [--version] [--exec-path[=GIT_EXEC_PATH]]
[--html-path] [-p|--paginate|--no-pager]
[--no-replace-objects] [--bare] [--git-dir=GIT_DIR]
[--work-tree=GIT_WORK_TREE] [--help] COMMAND [ARGS]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Git is a fast, scalable, distributed
revision control system with an unusually rich command set
that provides both high-level operations and full access to
internals.</p>

<p>See gittutorial(7) to get started, then see Everyday
Git[1] for a useful minimum set of commands, and &quot;man
git-commandname&quot; for documentation of each command. CVS
users may also want to read gitcvs- migration(7). See the
Git User s Manual[2] for a more in-depth introduction.</p>

<p>The COMMAND is either a name of a Git command (see
below) or an alias as defined in the configuration file (see
git-config(1)).</p>

<p>Formatted and hyperlinked version of the latest git
documentation can be viewed at
http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --version Prints the git suite version that the
git program came from.</p>

<p>--help Prints the synopsis and a list of the most
commonly used commands. If the option --all or -a is given
then all available commands are printed. If a git command is
named this option will bring up the manual page for that
command.</p>

<p>Other options are available to control how the manual
page is displayed. See git-help(1) for more information,
because git --help ... is converted internally into git help
....</p>

<p>--exec-path Path to wherever your core git programs are
installed. This can also be controlled by setting the
GIT_EXEC_PATH environment variable. If no path is given, git
will print the current setting and then exit.</p>

<p>--html-path Print the path to wherever your git HTML
documentation is installed and exit.</p>

<p>-p, --paginate Pipe all output into less (or if set,
$PAGER) if standard output is a terminal. This overrides the
pager.&lt;cmd&gt; configuration options (see the
&quot;Configuration Mechanism&quot; section below).</p>

<p>--no-pager Do not pipe git output into a pager.</p>

<p>--git-dir=&lt;path&gt; Set the path to the repository.
This can also be controlled by setting the GIT_DIR
environment variable. It can be an absolute path or relative
path to current working directory.</p>

<p>--work-tree=&lt;path&gt; Set the path to the working
tree. The value will not be used in combination with
repositories found automatically in a .git directory (i.e.
$GIT_DIR is not set). This can also be controlled by setting
the GIT_WORK_TREE environment variable and the core.worktree
configuration variable. It can be an absolute path or
relative path to the directory specified by --git-dir or
GIT_DIR. Note: If --git-dir or GIT_DIR are specified but
none of --work-tree, GIT_WORK_TREE and core.worktree is
specified, the current working directory is regarded as the
top directory of your working tree.</p>

<p>--bare Treat the repository as a bare repository. If
GIT_DIR environment is not set, it is set to the current
working directory.</p>

<p>--no-replace-objects Do not use replacement refs to
replace git objects. See git- replace(1) for more
information.</p>

<p>FURTHER DOCUMENTATION See the references above to get
started using git. The following is probably more detail
than necessary for a first-time user.</p>

<p>The git concepts chapter of the user-manual[3] and
gitcore-tutorial(7) both provide introductions to the
underlying git architecture.</p>

<p>See gitworkflows(7) for an overview of recommended
workflows.</p>

<p>See also the howto[4] documents for some useful
examples.</p>

<p>The internals are documented in the GIT API
documentation[5].</p>

<p>LOW-LEVEL COMMANDS (PLUMBING) Although git includes its
own porcelain layer, its low-level commands are sufficient
to support development of alternative porcelains. Developers
of such porcelains might start by reading about git-update-
index(1) and git-read-tree(1).</p>

<p>The interface (input, output, set of options and the
semantics) to these low-level commands are meant to be a lot
more stable than Porcelain level commands, because these
commands are primarily for scripted use. The interface to
Porcelain commands on the other hand are subject to change
in order to improve the end user experience.</p>

<p>The following description divides the low-level commands
into commands that manipulate objects (in the repository,
index, and working tree), commands that interrogate and
compare objects, and commands that move objects and
references between repositories.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION MECHANISM Starting from 0.99.9 (actually
mid 0.99.8.GIT), .git/config file is used to hold
per-repository configuration options. It is a simple text
file modeled after .ini format familiar to some people. Here
is an example:</p>

<p># # A &acute;#&acute; or &acute;;&acute; character
indicates a comment. #</p>

<p>; core variables [core] ; Don&acute;t trust file modes
filemode = false</p>

<p>; user identity [user] name = &quot;Junio C Hamano&quot;
email = &quot;junkio@twinsun.com&quot;</p>

<p>Various commands read from the configuration file and
adjust their operation accordingly. See git-config(1) for a
list.</p>

<p>IDENTIFIER TERMINOLOGY &lt;object&gt; Indicates the
object name for any type of object.</p>

<p>&lt;blob&gt; Indicates a blob object name.</p>

<p>&lt;tree&gt; Indicates a tree object name.</p>

<p>&lt;commit&gt; Indicates a commit object name.</p>

<p>&lt;tree-ish&gt; Indicates a tree, commit or tag object
name. A command that takes a &lt;tree-ish&gt; argument
ultimately wants to operate on a &lt;tree&gt; object but
automatically dereferences &lt;commit&gt; and &lt;tag&gt;
objects that point at a &lt;tree&gt;.</p>

<p>&lt;commit-ish&gt; Indicates a commit or tag object
name. A command that takes a &lt;commit-ish&gt; argument
ultimately wants to operate on a &lt;commit&gt; object but
automatically dereferences &lt;tag&gt; objects that point at
a &lt;commit&gt;.</p>

<p>&lt;type&gt; Indicates that an object type is required.
Currently one of: blob, tree, commit, or tag.</p>

<p>&lt;file&gt; Indicates a filename - almost always
relative to the root of the tree structure GIT_INDEX_FILE
describes.</p>

<p>SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS Any git command accepting any
&lt;object&gt; can also use the following symbolic
notation:</p>

<p>HEAD indicates the head of the current branch (i.e. the
contents of $GIT_DIR/HEAD).</p>

<p>&lt;tag&gt; a valid tag name (i.e. the contents of
$GIT_DIR/refs/tags/&lt;tag&gt;).</p>

<p>&lt;head&gt; a valid head name (i.e. the contents of
$GIT_DIR/refs/heads/&lt;head&gt;).</p>

<p>For a more complete list of ways to spell object names,
see &quot;SPECIFYING REVISIONS&quot; section in
git-rev-parse(1).</p>

<p>FILE/DIRECTORY STRUCTURE Please see the
gitrepository-layout(5) document.</p>

<p>Read githooks(5) for more details about each hook.</p>

<p>Higher level SCMs may provide and manage additional
information in the $GIT_DIR.</p>

<p>TERMINOLOGY Please see gitglossary(7).</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES Various git commands use the
following environment variables:</p>

<p>The git Repository These environment variables apply to
all core git commands. Nb: it is worth noting that they may
be used/overridden by SCMS sitting above git so take care if
using Cogito etc.</p>

<p>GIT_INDEX_FILE This environment allows the specification
of an alternate index file. If not specified, the default of
$GIT_DIR/index is used.</p>

<p>GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY If the object storage directory is
specified via this environment variable then the sha1
directories are created underneath - otherwise the default
$GIT_DIR/objects directory is used.</p>

<p>GIT_ALTERNATE_OBJECT_DIRECTORIES Due to the immutable
nature of git objects, old objects can be archived into
shared, read-only directories. This variable specifies a
&quot;:&quot; separated (on Windows &quot;;&quot; separated)
list of git object directories which can be used to search
for git objects. New objects will not be written to these
directories.</p>

<p>GIT_DIR If the GIT_DIR environment variable is set then
it specifies a path to use instead of the default .git for
the base of the repository.</p>

<p>GIT_WORK_TREE Set the path to the working tree. The
value will not be used in combination with repositories
found automatically in a .git directory (i.e. $GIT_DIR is
not set). This can also be controlled by the --work-tree
command line option and the core.worktree configuration
variable.</p>

<p>GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES This should be a colon-separated
list of absolute paths. If set, it is a list of directories
that git should not chdir up into while looking for a
repository directory. It will not exclude the current
working directory or a GIT_DIR set on the command line or in
the environment. (Useful for excluding slow-loading network
directories.)</p>

<p>git Commits GIT_AUTHOR_NAME, GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL,
GIT_AUTHOR_DATE, GIT_COMMITTER_NAME, GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL,
GIT_COMMITTER_DATE, EMAIL see git-commit-tree(1)</p>

<p>git Diffs GIT_DIFF_OPTS Only valid setting is
&quot;--unified=??&quot; or &quot;-u??&quot; to set the
number of context lines shown when a unified diff is
created. This takes precedence over any &quot;-U&quot; or
&quot;--unified&quot; option value passed on the git diff
command line.</p>

<p>GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF When the environment variable
GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF is set, the program named by it is called,
instead of the diff invocation described above. For a path
that is added, removed, or modified, GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF is
called with 7 parameters:</p>

<p>path old-file old-hex old-mode new-file new-hex
new-mode</p>

<p>where:</p>

<p>&lt;old|new&gt;-file are files GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF can use
to read the contents of &lt;old|new&gt;,</p>

<p>&lt;old|new&gt;-hex are the 40-hexdigit SHA1 hashes,</p>

<p>&lt;old|new&gt;-mode are the octal representation of the
file modes.</p>

<p>+ The file parameters can point at the users working
file (e.g. new-file in &quot;git-diff-files&quot;),
/dev/null (e.g. old-file when a new file is added), or a
temporary file (e.g. old-file in the index).
GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF should not worry about unlinking the
temporary file --- it is removed when GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF
exits.</p>

<p>+ For a path that is unmerged, GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF is
called with 1 parameter, &lt;path&gt;.</p>

<p>other GIT_MERGE_VERBOSITY A number controlling the
amount of output shown by the recursive merge strategy.
Overrides merge.verbosity. See git-merge(1)</p>

<p>GIT_PAGER This environment variable overrides $PAGER. If
it is set to an empty string or to the value
&quot;cat&quot;, git will not launch a pager. See also the
core.pager option in git-config(1).</p>

<p>GIT_SSH If this environment variable is set then git
fetch and git push will use this command instead of ssh when
they need to connect to a remote system. The $GIT_SSH
command will be given exactly two arguments: the
username@host (or just host) from the URL and the shell
command to execute on that remote system.</p>

<p>To pass options to the program that you want to list in
GIT_SSH you will need to wrap the program and options into a
shell script, then set GIT_SSH to refer to the shell
script.</p>

<p>Usually it is easier to configure any desired options
through your personal .ssh/config file. Please consult your
ssh documentation for further details.</p>

<p>GIT_FLUSH If this environment variable is set to
&quot;1&quot;, then commands such as git blame (in
incremental mode), git rev-list, git log, and git
whatchanged will force a flush of the output stream after
each commit-oriented record have been flushed. If this
variable is set to &quot;0&quot;, the output of these
commands will be done using completely buffered I/O. If this
environment variable is not set, git will choose buffered or
record-oriented flushing based on whether stdout appears to
be redirected to a file or not.</p>

<p>GIT_TRACE If this variable is set to &quot;1&quot;,
&quot;2&quot; or &quot;true&quot; (comparison is case
insensitive), git will print trace: messages on stderr
telling about alias expansion, built-in command execution
and external command execution. If this variable is set to
an integer value greater than 1 and lower than 10 (strictly)
then git will interpret this value as an open file
descriptor and will try to write the trace messages into
this file descriptor. Alternatively, if this variable is set
to an absolute path (starting with a / character), git will
interpret this as a file path and will try to write the
trace messages into it.</p>

<p>DISCUSSION More detail on the following is available
from the git concepts chapter of the user-manual[3] and
gitcore-tutorial(7).</p>

<p>A git project normally consists of a working directory
with a &quot;.git&quot; subdirectory at the top level. The
.git directory contains, among other things, a compressed
object database representing the complete history of the
project, an &quot;index&quot; file which links that history
to the current contents of the working tree, and named
pointers into that history such as tags and branch
heads.</p>

<p>The object database contains objects of three main
types: blobs, which hold file data; trees, which point to
blobs and other trees to build up directory hierarchies; and
commits, which each reference a single tree and some number
of parent commits.</p>

<p>The commit, equivalent to what other systems call a
&quot;changeset&quot; or &quot;version&quot;, represents a
step in the projects history, and each parent represents an
immediately preceding step. Commits with more than one
parent represent merges of independent lines of
development.</p>

<p>All objects are named by the SHA1 hash of their
contents, normally written as a string of 40 hex digits.
Such names are globally unique. The entire history leading
up to a commit can be vouched for by signing just that
commit. A fourth object type, the tag, is provided for this
purpose.</p>

<p>When first created, objects are stored in individual
files, but for efficiency may later be compressed together
into &quot;pack files&quot;.</p>

<p>Named pointers called refs mark interesting points in
history. A ref may contain the SHA1 name of an object or the
name of another ref. Refs with names beginning ref/head/
contain the SHA1 name of the most recent commit (or
&quot;head&quot;) of a branch under development. SHA1 names
of tags of interest are stored under ref/tags/. A special
ref named HEAD contains the name of the currently
checked-out branch.</p>

<p>The index file is initialized with a list of all paths
and, for each path, a blob object and a set of attributes.
The blob object represents the contents of the file as of
the head of the current branch. The attributes (last
modified time, size, etc.) are taken from the corresponding
file in the working tree. Subsequent changes to the working
tree can be found by comparing these attributes. The index
may be updated with new content, and new commits may be
created from the content stored in the index.</p>

<p>The index is also capable of storing multiple entries
(called &quot;stages&quot;) for a given pathname. These
stages are used to hold the various unmerged version of a
file when a merge is in progress.</p>
