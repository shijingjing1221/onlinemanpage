<p>MYSQL_INSTALL_DB() MYSQL_INSTALL_DB()</p>

<p>NAME mysql_install_db - initialize MySQL data
directory</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS mysql_install_db [options]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION mysql_install_db initializes the MySQL data
directory and creates the system tables that it contains, if
they do not exist.</p>

<p>To invoke mysql_install_db, use the following
syntax:</p>

<p>shell&gt; mysql_install_db [options]</p>

<p>Because the MySQL server, mysqld, needs to access the
data directory when it runs later, you should either run
mysql_install_db from the same account that will be used for
running mysqld or run it as root and use the --user option
to indicate the user name that mysqld will run as. It might
be necessary to specify other options such as --basedir or
--datadir if mysql_install_db does not use the correct
locations for the installation directory or data directory.
For example:</p>

<p>shell&gt; bin/mysql_install_db --user=mysql
--basedir=/opt/mysql/mysql
--datadir=/opt/mysql/mysql/data</p>

<p>mysql_install_db needs to invoke mysqld with the
--bootstrap and --skip-grant-tables options (see Section
2.3.2, Typical configure Options ). If MySQL was configured
with the --disable-grant-options option, --bootstrap and
--skip-grant-tables will be disabled. To handle this, set
the MYSQLD_BOOTSTRAP environment variable to the full path
name of a server that has all options enabled.
mysql_install_db will use that server.</p>

<p>mysql_install_db supports the following options, which
can be specified on the command line or in the
[mysql_install_db] and (if they are common to mysqld)
[mysqld] option file groups.</p>

<p>&middot; --basedir=path</p>

<p>The path to the MySQL installation directory.</p>

<p>&middot; --force</p>

<p>Cause mysql_install_db to run even if DNS does not work.
In that case, grant table entries that normally use host
names will use IP addresses.</p>

<p>&middot; --datadir=path, --ldata=path</p>

<p>The path to the MySQL data directory.</p>

<p>&middot; --rpm</p>

<p>For internal use. This option is used by RPM files
during the MySQL installation process.</p>

<p>&middot; --skip-name-resolve</p>

<p>Use IP addresses rather than host names when creating
grant table entries. This option can be useful if your DNS
does not work.</p>

<p>&middot; --srcdir=path</p>

<p>For internal use. The directory under which
mysql_install_db looks for support files such as the error
message file and the file for populating the help tables.
This option was added in MySQL 5.1.14.</p>

<p>&middot; --user=user_name</p>

<p>The login user name to use for running mysqld. Files and
directories created by mysqld will be owned by this user.
You must be root to use this option. By default, mysqld runs
using your current login name and files and directories that
it creates will be owned by you.</p>

<p>&middot; --verbose</p>

<p>Verbose mode. Print more information about what the
program does.</p>

<p>&middot; --windows</p>

<p>For internal use. This option is used for creating
Windows distributions.</p>
