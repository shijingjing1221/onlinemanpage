<p>XkbIgnoreExtension(3) XKB FUNCTIONS
XkbIgnoreExtension(3)</p>

<p>NAME XkbIgnoreExtension - Prevents core X library
keyboard functions from using the X Keyboard Extension</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS Bool XkbIgnoreExtension (Bool *ignore);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS ignore True means ignore the extension</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION If a server supports the Xkb extension, the
X library normally imple- ments preXkb keyboard functions
using the Xkb keyboard description and state. The server Xkb
keyboard state may differ from the preXkb key- board state.
This difference does not affect most clients, but there are
exceptions. To allow these clients to work properly, you may
instruct the extension not to use Xkb functionality.</p>

<p>Call XkbIgnoreExtension to prevent core X library
keyboard functions from using the X Keyboard Extension. You
must call XkbIgnoreExtension before you open a server
connection; Xkb does not provide a way to enable or disable
use of the extension once a connection is estab- lished.</p>

<p>XkbIgnoreExtension tells the X library whether to use
the X Keyboard Extension on any subsequently opened X
display connections. If ignore is True, the library does not
initialize the Xkb extension when it opens a new display.
This forces the X server to use compatibility mode and
communicate with the client using only core protocol
requests and events. If ignore is False, the library treats
subsequent calls to XOpenDisplay normally and uses Xkb
extension requests, events, and state. Do not explicitly use
Xkb on a connection for which it is dis- abled.
XkbIgnoreExtension returns False if it was unable to apply
the ignore request.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUES True The XkbIgnoreExtension returns True
if</p>

<p>False The XkbIgnoreExtension function returns False if
it was unable to apply the ignore request.</p>
