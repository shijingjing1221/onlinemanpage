<p>NAME amdump - back up all disks in an Amanda
configuration</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS amdump config [host [disk...]...] [-o
configoption]...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Amdump switches to the appropriate Amanda
configuration directory, e.g. /usr/local/etc/amanda/config,
then attempts to back up every disk specified by the
amanda.conf file. Amdump is normally run by cron.</p>

<p>You can specify many host/disk expressions, only disks
that match an expression will be dumped. All disks are
dumped if no expressions are given.</p>

<p>If the file /usr/local/etc/amanda/config/hold exists,
amdump will wait until it is removed before starting the
backups. This allows scheduled backups to be delayed when
circumstances warrant, for example, if the tape device is
being used for some other purpose. While waiting, amdump
checks for the hold file every minute.</p>

<p>See the amanda(8) man page for more details about
Amanda.</p>

<p>OPTIONS host [disk]* Specify the host and disk on which
the command will work.</p>

<p>-o configoption See the &quot;CONFIGURATION
OVERRIDE&quot; section in amanda(8).</p>

<p>EXAMPLE Here is a typical crontab entry. It runs amdump
every weeknight at 1 a.m. as user bin: 0 1 * * 1-5 bin
/usr/local/sbin/amdump daily</p>

<p>Please see the crontab(5) or crontab(1) manual page for
the correct crontab format for your system.</p>

<p>MESSAGES amdump: waiting for hold file to be removed The
&quot;hold&quot; file exists and amdump is waiting for it to
be removed before starting backups.</p>

<p>amdump: amdump or amflush is already running, or you
must run amcleanup Amdump detected another amdump or amflush
running, or the remains of a previous incomplete amdump or
amflush run. This run is terminated. If the problem is
caused by the remains of a previous run, you must execute
amcleanup(8) and then rerun amdump.</p>

<p>EXIT CODE The exit code of amdump is the ORed value of:
0 = success 1 = error 2 = a dle give strange message 4 = a
dle failed 8 = Don&acute;t know the status of a dle
