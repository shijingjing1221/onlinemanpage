<p>STRUCT USB_DRIVER(9) Host-Side Data Types and Macro
STRUCT USB_DRIVER(9)</p>

<p>NAME struct_usb_driver - identifies USB interface driver
to usbcore</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS struct usb_driver { const char * name; int (*
probe) (struct usb_interface *intf,const struct
usb_device_id *id); void (* disconnect) (struct
usb_interface *intf); int (* ioctl) (struct usb_interface
*intf, unsigned int code,void *buf); int (* suspend) (struct
usb_interface *intf, pm_message_t message); int (* resume)
(struct usb_interface *intf); int (* reset_resume) (struct
usb_interface *intf); int (* pre_reset) (struct
usb_interface *intf); int (* post_reset) (struct
usb_interface *intf); const struct usb_device_id * id_table;
struct usb_dynids dynids; struct usbdrv_wrap drvwrap;
unsigned int no_dynamic_id:1; unsigned int
supports_autosuspend:1; unsigned int soft_unbind:1; };</p>

<p>MEMBERS name The driver name should be unique among USB
drivers, and should normally be the same as the module
name.</p>

<p>probe Called to see if the driver is willing to manage a
particular interface on a device. If it is, probe returns
zero and uses usb_set_intfdata to associate driver-specific
data with the interface. It may also use usb_set_interface
to specify the appropriate altsetting. If unwilling to
manage the interface, return -ENODEV, if genuine IO errors
occured, an appropriate negative errno value.</p>

<p>disconnect Called when the interface is no longer
accessible, usually because its device has been (or is
being) disconnected or the driver module is being
unloaded.</p>

<p>ioctl Used for drivers that want to talk to userspace
through the usbfs filesystem. This lets devices provide ways
to expose information to user space regardless of where they
do (or don&acute;t) show up otherwise in the filesystem.</p>

<p>suspend Called when the device is going to be suspended
by the system.</p>

<p>resume Called when the device is being resumed by the
system.</p>

<p>reset_resume Called when the suspended device has been
reset instead of being resumed.</p>

<p>pre_reset Called by usb_reset_device when the device is
about to be reset.</p>

<p>post_reset Called by usb_reset_device after the device
has been reset</p>

<p>id_table USB drivers use ID table to support
hotplugging. Export this with MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE(usb,...).
This must be set or your driver&acute;s probe function will
never get called.</p>

<p>dynids used internally to hold the list of dynamically
added device ids for this driver.</p>

<p>drvwrap Driver-model core structure wrapper.</p>

<p>no_dynamic_id if set to 1, the USB core will not allow
dynamic ids to be added to this driver by preventing the
sysfs file from being created.</p>

<p>supports_autosuspend if set to 0, the USB core will not
allow autosuspend for interfaces bound to this driver.</p>

<p>soft_unbind if set to 1, the USB core will not kill URBs
and disable endpoints before calling the driver&acute;s
disconnect method.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION USB interface drivers must provide a name,
probe and disconnect methods, and an id_table. Other driver
fields are optional.</p>

<p>The id_table is used in hotplugging. It holds a set of
descriptors, and specialized data may be associated with
each entry. That table is used by both user and kernel mode
hotplugging support.</p>

<p>The probe and disconnect methods are called in a context
where they can sleep, but they should avoid abusing the
privilege. Most work to connect to a device should be done
when the device is opened, and undone at the last close. The
disconnect code needs to address concurrency issues with
respect to open and close methods, as well as forcing all
pending I/O requests to complete (by unlinking them as
necessary, and blocking until the unlinks complete).</p>
