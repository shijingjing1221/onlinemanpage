<p>AUTHOR According to the WEB documentation:</p>

<p>The first PLtoTF program was designed by Leo Guibas in
the sum- mer of 1978. Contributions by Frank Liang, Doug
Wyatt, and Lyle Ramshaw also had a significant effect on the
evolution of the present code.</p>

<p>Extensions for an enhanced ligature mechanism were added
by D.E. Knuth in 1989.</p>

<p>Extensions to handle extended font metric files ( OFM)
were added by John Plaice in December 1995 and January 1996,
result- ing in the new program OPL2OFM.</p>
