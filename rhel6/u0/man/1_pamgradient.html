<p>NAME pamgradient - create a four-corner gradient PAM or
PNM image</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pamgradient [-maxval=maxval] color-tl color-tr
color-bl color-br width height</p>

<p>Minimum unique abbreviation of option is acceptable. You
may use dou- ble hyphens instead of single hyphen to denote
options. You may use white space in place of the equals sign
to separate an option name from its value.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pamgradient creates an image of the specified dimensions
width by height which contains a smooth, two-dimensional
gradient between the specified colors of the four corners
(from top left to bottom right).</p>

<p>Specify the colors as described for the argument of the
ppm_parsec- olor() library routine .</p>

<p>If all four colors are gray values, pamgradient creates
a grayscale image (PAM tuple type GRAYSCALE). Otherwise, it
creates a color image (PAM tuple type RGB).</p>

<p>OPTIONS -maxval=maxval</p>

<p>maxval of the generated image. (See PAM(1)and
PNM(1)specifica- tions).</p>

<p>SEE ALSO ppmmake(1), ppmrainbow(1), pgmramp(1),
ppmpat(1), pam(1), pnm(1)</p>

<p>NOTE Only the top left corner of the generated image has
exactly the speci- fied color. The color of the top right
corner is a bit shifted to the left, the bottom left corner
a bit up, and the bottom right corner left and up. This
ensures nice transitions when combining adjacent (very
narrow) gradients, and doesnt play a role when the gradient
butts against a solid surface.</p>

<p>This effect is created by the integer arithmetic used
for the interpo- lation of the color values, and since it
doesnt make a difference for all practical purposes I might
as well sell it as a feature.</p>
