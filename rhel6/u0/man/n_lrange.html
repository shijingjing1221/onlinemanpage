<p>lrange(n) Tcl Built-In Commands lrange(n)</p>


<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME lrange - Return one or more adjacent elements from
a list</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS lrange list first last
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION List must be a valid Tcl list. This command
will return a new list consisting of elements first through
last, inclusive. The index values first and last are
interpreted the same as index values for the command string
index, supporting simple index arithmetic and indices
relative to the end of the list. If first is less than zero,
it is treated as if it were zero. If last is greater than or
equal to the number of elements in the list, then it is
treated as if it were end. If first is greater than last
then an empty string is returned. Note: lrange list first
first does not always produce the same result as lindex list
first (although it often does for simple fields that are not
enclosed in braces); it does, however, produce exactly the
same results as list [lindex list first]</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Selecting the first two elements: % lrange {a b
c d e} 0 1 a b</p>

<p>Selecting the last three elements: % lrange {a b c d e}
end-2 end c d e</p>

<p>Selecting everything except the first and last element:
% lrange {a b c d e} 1 end-1 b c d</p>

<p>Selecting a single element with lrange is not the same
as doing so with lindex: % set var {some {elements to}
select} some {elements to} select % lindex $var 1 elements
to % lrange $var 1 1 {elements to}</p>
