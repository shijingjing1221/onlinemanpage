<p>SDL_CreateRGBSurface(3) SDL API Reference
SDL_CreateRGBSurface(3)</p>

<p>NAME SDL_CreateRGBSurface - Create an empty
SDL_Surface</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &quot;SDL.h&quot;</p>

<p>SDL_Surface *SDL_CreateRGBSurface(Uint32 flags, int
width, int height, int depth, Uint32 Rmask, Uint32 Gmask,
Uint32 Bmask, Uint32 Amask);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Allocate an empty surface (must be called
after SDL_SetVideoMode)</p>

<p>If depth is 8 bits an empty palette is allocated for the
surface, oth- erwise a packed-pixel SDL_PixelFormat is
created using the [RGBA]mask s provided (see
SDL_PixelFormat). The flags specifies the type of surface
that should be created, it is an OR d combination of the
following possible values.</p>

<p>SDL_SWSURFACE SDL will create the surface in system
memory. This improves the performance of pixel level access,
however you may not be able to take advantage of some types
of hardware blitting.</p>

<p>SDL_HWSURFACE SDL will attempt to create the surface in
video memory. This will allow SDL to take advantage of
Video-&gt;Video blits (which are often accelerated).</p>

<p>SDL_SRCCOLORKEY This flag turns on colourkeying for
blits from this surface. If SDL_HWSURFACE is also specified
and colourkeyed blits are hardware-accelerated, then SDL
will attempt to place the surface in video mem- ory. Use
SDL_SetColorKey to set or clear this flag after surface
creation.</p>

<p>SDL_SRCALPHA This flag turns on alpha-blending for blits
from this surface. If SDL_HWSURFACE is also specified and
alpha-blending blits are hardware-accelerated, then the
surface will be placed in video memory if possible. Use
SDL_SetAlpha to set or clear this flag after surface
creation.</p>

<p>Note:</p>

<p>If an alpha-channel is specified (that is, if Amask is
nonzero), then the SDL_SRCALPHA flag is automatically set.
You may remove this flag by calling SDL_SetAlpha after
surface creation.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Returns the created surface, or NULL upon
error.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE /* Create a 32-bit surface with the bytes of
each pixel in R,G,B,A order, as expected by OpenGL for
textures */ SDL_Surface *surface; Uint32 rmask, gmask,
bmask, amask;</p>

<p>/* SDL interprets each pixel as a 32-bit number, so our
masks must depend on the endianness (byte order) of the
machine */ #if SDL_BYTEORDER == SDL_BIG_ENDIAN rmask =
0xff000000; gmask = 0x00ff0000; bmask = 0x0000ff00; amask =
0x000000ff; #else rmask = 0x000000ff; gmask = 0x0000ff00;
bmask = 0x00ff0000; amask = 0xff000000; #endif</p>

<p>surface = SDL_CreateRGBSurface(SDL_SWSURFACE, width,
height, 32, rmask, gmask, bmask, amask); if(surface == NULL)
{ fprintf(stderr, &quot;CreateRGBSurface failed: %s &quot;,
SDL_GetError()); exit(1); }</p>
