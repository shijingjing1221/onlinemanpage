<p>NAME pbmtextps - render text into a PBM image using a
postscript interpreter</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pbmtextps [-font fontname] [-fontsize fontsize]
[-resolution resolu- tion] [-stroke strokesize] text</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pbmtextps takes a single line of text from the command
line and renders it into a PBM image. The image is of a
single line of text; newline characters in the input have no
effect.</p>

<p>The image is cropped at the top and the right. It is not
cropped at the left or bottom so that the text begins at the
same position rela- tive to the origin. You can use pnmcrop
to crop it all the way.</p>

<p>See pbmtext for a more sophisticated generator of text,
but using less common font formats. pbmtext can generate
multiple lines of text.</p>

<p>The -plain common option has no effect before Netpbm
10.42 (March 2008). The output is always raw PBM.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -font By default, pbmtextps uses TimesRoman.</p>

<p>You can specify the font to use with the -font option.
This is the name of any valid postscript font which is
installed on your system.</p>

<p>-fontsize Size of font in points. See the -resolution
option for informa- tion on how to interpret this size.</p>

<p>Default is 24 points.</p>

<p>-resolution Resolution in dots per inch of distance
measurements pertaining to generation of the image. PBM
images dont have any inherent resolution, so a distance such
as &quot;1 inch&quot; doesnt mean anything unless you
separately specify what resolution youre talking about.
Thats what this option does.</p>

<p>In particular, the meaning of the font size is
determined by this resolution. If the font size is 24 points
and the resolu- tion is 150 dpi, then the font size is 50
pixels.</p>

<p>Default is 150 dpi.</p>

<p>-stroke Width of line to use for stroke font. There is
no default stroke width because the characters are solid by
default.</p>

<p>USAGE You can generate antialiased text by using a
larger resolution than the default and scaling the image
down using pamscale.</p>

<p>See the manual for the similar pbmtext for more advice
on usage.</p>

<p>HISTORY pbmtextps was added to Netpbm in Release 10.0
(June 2002).</p>
