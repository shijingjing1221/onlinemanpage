<p>QMSG(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual QMSG(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME qmsg - send message to batch jobs</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS qmsg [-E][-O] message_string job_identifier
...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION To send a message to a batch job is to
request that a server write a message string into one or
more output files of the batch job. A mes- sage is sent to a
batch job by a request to the batch server that man- ages
the batch job. The qmsg utility is a user-accessible batch
client that requests the sending of messages to one or more
batch jobs.</p>

<p>The qmsg utility shall write messages into the files of
batch jobs by sending a Job Message Request to the batch
server that manages the batch job. The qmsg utility shall
not directly write the message into the files of the batch
job.</p>

<p>The qmsg utility shall send a Job Message Request for
those batch jobs, and only those batch jobs, for which a
batch job_identifier is pre- sented to the utility.</p>

<p>The qmsg utility shall send Job Message Requests for
batch jobs in the order in which their batch job_identifiers
are presented to the util- ity.</p>

<p>If the qmsg utility fails to process any batch
job_identifier success- fully, the utility shall proceed to
process the remaining batch job_identifiers, if any.</p>

<p>The qmsg utility shall not exit before a Job Message
Request has been sent to the server that manages the batch
job that corresponds to each successfully processed batch
job_identifier.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The qmsg utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>The following options shall be supported by the
implementation:</p>

<p>-E Specify that the message is written to the standard
error of each batch job.</p>

<p>The qmsg utility shall write the message into the
standard error of the batch job.</p>

<p>-O Specify that the message is written to the standard
output of each batch job.</p>

<p>The qmsg utility shall write the message into the
standard output of the batch job.</p>

<p>If neither the -O nor the -E option is presented to the
qmsg utility, the utility shall write the message into an
implementation-defined file. The conformance document for
the implementation shall describe the name and location of
the implementation-defined file. If both the -O and the -E
options are presented to the qmsg utility, then the util-
ity shall write the messages to both standard output and
standard error.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The qmsg utility shall accept a minimum of two
operands, message_string and one or more batch
job_identifiers.</p>

<p>The message_string operand shall be the string to be
written to one or more output files of the batch job
followed by a &lt;newline&gt;. If the string contains
&lt;blank&gt;s, then the application shall ensure that the
string is quoted. The message_string shall be encoded in the
portable character set (see the Base Definitions volume of
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 6.1, Portable Character
Set).</p>

<p>All remaining operands are batch job_identifiers that
conform to the syntax for a batch job_identifier (see Batch
Job Identifier ).</p>

<p>STDIN Not used.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of qmsg:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in
arguments).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>LOGNAME Determine the login name of the user.</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT None.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 Successful completion.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS In addition to the default
behavior, the qmsg utility shall not be required to write a
diagnostic message to standard error when the error reply
received from a batch server indicates that the batch
job_identi- fier does not exist on the server. Whether or
not the qmsg utility waits to output the diagnostic message
while attempting to locate the job on other servers is
implementation-defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The qmsg utility allows users to write
messages into the output files of running jobs. Users,
including operators and administrators, have a number of
occasions when they want to place messages in the output
files of a batch job. For example, if a disk that is being
used by a batch job is showing errors, the operator might
note this in the stan- dard error stream of the batch
job.</p>

<p>The options of the qmsg utility provide users with the
means of placing the message in the output stream of their
choice. The default output stream for the message-if the
user does not designate an output stream- is
implementation-defined, since many implementations will
provide, as an extension to this volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001, a log file that shows the history of utility
execution.</p>

<p>If users wish to send a message to a set of jobs that
meet a selection criteria, the qselect utility can be used
to acquire the appropriate list of job identifiers.</p>

<p>The -E option allows users to place the message in the
standard error stream of the batch job.</p>

<p>The -O option allows users to place the message in the
standard output stream of the batch job.</p>

<p>Historically, the qmsg utility is an existing practice
in the offerings of one or more implementors of an
NQS-derived batch system. The utility has been found to be
useful enough that it deserves to be included in this volume
of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
