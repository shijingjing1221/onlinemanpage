<p>EXECVE(2) Linux Programmer s Manual EXECVE(2)</p>

<p>NAME execve - execute program</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>int execve(const char *filename, char *const argv[],
char *const envp[]);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION execve() executes the program pointed to by
filename. filename must be either a binary executable, or a
script starting with a line of the form:</p>

<p>#! interpreter [optional-arg]</p>

<p>For details of the latter case, see &quot;Interpreter
scripts&quot; below.</p>

<p>argv is an array of argument strings passed to the new
program. envp is an array of strings, conventionally of the
form key=value, which are passed as environment to the new
program. Both argv and envp must be terminated by a null
pointer. The argument vector and environment can be accessed
by the called programs main function, when it is defined
as:</p>

<p>int main(int argc, char *argv[], char *envp[])</p>

<p>execve() does not return on success, and the text, data,
bss, and stack of the calling process are overwritten by
that of the program loaded.</p>

<p>If the current program is being ptraced, a SIGTRAP is
sent to it after a successful execve().</p>

<p>If the set-user-ID bit is set on the program file
pointed to by file- name, and the underlying file system is
not mounted nosuid (the MS_NOSUID flag for mount(2)), and
the calling process is not being ptraced, then the effective
user ID of the calling process is changed to that of the
owner of the program file. Similarly, when the set- group-ID
bit of the program file is set the effective group ID of the
calling process is set to the group of the program file.</p>

<p>The effective user ID of the process is copied to the
saved set-user- ID; similarly, the effective group ID is
copied to the saved set-group- ID. This copying takes place
after any effective ID changes that occur because of the
set-user-ID and set-group-ID permission bits.</p>

<p>If the executable is an a.out dynamically linked binary
executable con- taining shared-library stubs, the Linux
dynamic linker ld.so(8) is called at the start of execution
to bring needed shared libraries into memory and link the
executable with them.</p>

<p>If the executable is a dynamically linked ELF
executable, the inter- preter named in the PT_INTERP segment
is used to load the needed shared libraries. This
interpreter is typically /lib/ld-linux.so.1 for bina- ries
linked with the Linux libc 5, or /lib/ld-linux.so.2 for
binaries linked with the glibc 2.</p>

<p>All process attributes are preserved during an execve(),
except the following:</p>

<p>* The dispositions of any signals that are being caught
are reset to being ignored.</p>

<p>* Any alternate signal stack is not preserved
(sigaltstack(2)).</p>

<p>* Memory mappings are not preserved (mmap(2)).</p>

<p>* Attached System V shared memory segments are detached
(shmat(2)).</p>

<p>* POSIX shared memory regions are unmapped
(shm_open(3)).</p>

<p>* Open POSIX message queue descriptors are closed
(mq_overview(7)).</p>

<p>* Any open POSIX named semaphores are closed
(sem_overview(7)).</p>

<p>* POSIX timers are not preserved (timer_create(2)).</p>

<p>* Any open directory streams are closed
(opendir(3)).</p>

<p>* Memory locks are not preserved (mlock(2),
mlockall(2)).</p>

<p>* Exit handlers are not preserved (atexit(3),
on_exit(3)).</p>

<p>* The floating-point environment is reset to the default
(see fenv(3)).</p>

<p>The process attributes in the preceding list are all
specified in POSIX.1-2001. The following Linux-specific
process attributes are also not preserved during an
execve():</p>

<p>* The prctl(2) PR_SET_DUMPABLE flag is set, unless a
set-user-ID or set-group ID program is being executed, in
which case it is cleared.</p>

<p>* The prctl(2) PR_SET_KEEPCAPS flag is cleared.</p>

<p>* The process name, as set by prctl(2) PR_SET_NAME (and
displayed by ps -o comm), is reset to the name of the new
executable file.</p>

<p>* The termination signal is reset to SIGCHLD (see
clone(2)).</p>

<p>Note the following further points:</p>

<p>* All threads other than the calling thread are
destroyed during an execve(). Mutexes, condition variables,
and other pthreads objects are not preserved.</p>

<p>* The equivalent of setlocale(LC_ALL, &quot;C&quot;) is
executed at program start-up.</p>

<p>* POSIX.1-2001 specifies that the dispositions of any
signals that are ignored or set to the default are left
unchanged. POSIX.1-2001 specifies one exception: if SIGCHLD
is being ignored, then an imple- mentation may leave the
disposition unchanged or reset it to the default; Linux does
the former.</p>

<p>* Any outstanding asynchronous I/O operations are
canceled (aio_read(3), aio_write(3)).</p>

<p>* For the handling of capabilities during execve(), see
capabili- ties(7).</p>

<p>* By default, file descriptors remain open across an
execve(). File descriptors that are marked close-on-exec are
closed; see the description of FD_CLOEXEC in fcntl(2). (If a
file descriptor is closed, this will cause the release of
all record locks obtained on the underlying file by this
process. See fcntl(2) for details.) POSIX.1-2001 says that
if file descriptors 0, 1, and 2 would other- wise be closed
after a successful execve(), and the process would gain
privilege because the set-user_ID or set-group_ID permission
bit was set on the executed file, then the system may open
an unspecified file for each of these file descriptors. As a
general principle, no portable program, whether privileged
or not, can assume that these three file descriptors will
remain closed across an execve().</p>

<p>Interpreter scripts An interpreter script is a text file
that has execute permission enabled and whose first line is
of the form:</p>

<p>#! interpreter [optional-arg]</p>

<p>The interpreter must be a valid pathname for an
executable which is not itself a script. If the filename
argument of execve() specifies an interpreter script, then
interpreter will be invoked with the following
arguments:</p>

<p>interpreter [optional-arg] filename arg...</p>

<p>where arg... is the series of words pointed to by the
argv argument of execve().</p>

<p>For portable use, optional-arg should either be absent,
or be specified as a single word (i.e., it should not
contain white space); see NOTES below.</p>

<p>Limits on size of arguments and environment Most Unix
implementations impose some limit on the total size of the
command-line argument (argv) and environment (envp) strings
that may be passed to a new program. POSIX.1 allows an
implementation to advertise this limit using the ARG_MAX
constant (either defined in &lt;limits.h&gt; or available at
run time using the call sysconf(_SC_ARG_MAX)).</p>

<p>On Linux prior to kernel 2.6.23, the memory used to
store the environ- ment and argument strings was limited to
32 pages (defined by the ker- nel constant MAX_ARG_PAGES).
On architectures with a 4-kB page size, this yields a
maximum size of 128 kB.</p>

<p>On kernel 2.6.23 and later, most architectures support a
size limit derived from the soft RLIMIT_STACK resource limit
(see getrlimit(2)) that is in force at the time of the
execve() call. (Architectures with no memory management unit
are excepted: they maintain the limit that was in effect
before kernel 2.6.23.) This change allows programs to have a
much larger argument and/or environment list. For these
archi- tectures, the total size is limited to 1/4 of the
allowed stack size. (Imposing the 1/4-limit ensures that the
new program always has some stack space.) Since Linux
2.6.25, the kernel places a floor of 32 pages on this size
limit, so that, even when RLIMIT_STACK is set very low,
applications are guaranteed to have at least as much
argument and environment space as was provided by Linux
2.6.23 and earlier. (This guarantee was not provided in
Linux 2.6.23 and 2.6.24.) Additionally, the limit per string
is 32 pages (the kernel constant MAX_ARG_STRLEN), and the
maximum number of strings is 0x7FFFFFFF.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, execve() does not return, on
error -1 is returned, and errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS E2BIG The total number of bytes in the
environment (envp) and argument list (argv) is too
large.</p>

<p>EACCES Search permission is denied on a component of the
path prefix of filename or the name of a script interpreter.
(See also path_resolution(7).)</p>

<p>EACCES The file or a script interpreter is not a regular
file.</p>

<p>EACCES Execute permission is denied for the file or a
script or ELF interpreter.</p>

<p>EACCES The file system is mounted noexec.</p>

<p>EFAULT filename points outside your accessible address
space.</p>

<p>EINVAL An ELF executable had more than one PT_INTERP
segment (i.e., tried to name more than one interpreter).</p>

<p>EIO An I/O error occurred.</p>

<p>EISDIR An ELF interpreter was a directory.</p>

<p>ELIBBAD An ELF interpreter was not in a recognized
format.</p>

<p>ELOOP Too many symbolic links were encountered in
resolving filename or the name of a script or ELF
interpreter.</p>

<p>EMFILE The process has the maximum number of files
open.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG filename is too long.</p>

<p>ENFILE The system limit on the total number of open
files has been reached.</p>

<p>ENOENT The file filename or a script or ELF interpreter
does not exist, or a shared library needed for file or
interpreter cannot be found.</p>

<p>ENOEXEC An executable is not in a recognized format, is
for the wrong architecture, or has some other format error
that means it can- not be executed.</p>

<p>ENOMEM Insufficient kernel memory was available.</p>

<p>ENOTDIR A component of the path prefix of filename or a
script or ELF interpreter is not a directory.</p>

<p>EPERM The file system is mounted nosuid, the user is not
the supe- ruser, and the file has the set-user-ID or
set-group-ID bit set.</p>

<p>EPERM The process is being traced, the user is not the
superuser and the file has the set-user-ID or set-group-ID
bit set.</p>

<p>ETXTBSY Executable was open for writing by one or more
processes.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO SVr4, 4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001. POSIX.1-2001
does not document the #! behavior but is otherwise
compatible.</p>

<p>NOTES Set-user-ID and set-group-ID processes can not be
ptrace(2)d.</p>

<p>Linux ignores the set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits on
scripts.</p>

<p>The result of mounting a file system nosuid varies
across Linux kernel versions: some will refuse execution of
set-user-ID and set-group-ID executables when this would
give the user powers she did not have already (and return
EPERM), some will just ignore the set-user-ID and
set-group-ID bits and exec() successfully.</p>

<p>A maximum line length of 127 characters is allowed for
the first line in a #! executable shell script.</p>

<p>The semantics of the optional-arg argument of an
interpreter script vary across implementations. On Linux,
the entire string following the interpreter name is passed
as a single argument to the interpreter, and this string can
include white space. However, behavior differs on some other
systems. Some systems use the first white space to terminate
optional-arg. On some systems, an interpreter script can
have multiple arguments, and white spaces in optional-arg
are used to delimit the arguments.</p>

<p>On Linux, argv can be specified as NULL, which has the
same effect as specifying this argument as a pointer to a
list containing a single NULL pointer. Do not take advantage
of this misfeature! It is non- standard and non-portable: on
most other Unix systems doing this will result in an error
(EFAULT).</p>

<p>POSIX.1-2001 says that values returned by sysconf(3)
should be invari- ant over the lifetime of a process.
However, since Linux 2.6.23, if the RLIMIT_STACK resource
limit changes, then the value reported by _SC_ARG_MAX will
also change, to reflect the fact that the limit on space for
holding command-line arguments and environment variables has
changed.</p>

<p>Historical With Unix V6 the argument list of an exec()
call was ended by 0, while the argument list of main was
ended by -1. Thus, this argument list was not directly
usable in a further exec() call. Since Unix V7 both are
NULL.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE The following program is designed to be execed
by the second program below. It just echoes its command-line
one per line.</p>

<p>/* myecho.c */</p>

<p>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</p>

<p>int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { int j;</p>

<p>for (j = 0; j &lt; argc; j++) printf(&quot;argv[%d]:
%s0, j, argv[j]);</p>

<p>exit(EXIT_SUCCESS); }</p>

<p>This program can be used to exec the program named in
its command-line argument:</p>

<p>/* execve.c */</p>

<p>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt; #include &lt;assert.h&gt;</p>

<p>int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { char *newargv[] = {
NULL, &quot;hello&quot;, &quot;world&quot;, NULL }; char
*newenviron[] = { NULL };</p>

<p>assert(argc == 2); /* argv[1] identifies program to exec
*/ newargv[0] = argv[1];</p>

<p>execve(argv[1], newargv, newenviron);
perror(&quot;execve&quot;); /* execve() only returns on
error */ exit(EXIT_FAILURE); }</p>

<p>We can use the second program to exec the first as
follows:</p>

<p>$ cc myecho.c -o myecho $ cc execve.c -o execve $
./execve ./myecho argv[0]: ./myecho argv[1]: hello argv[2]:
world</p>

<p>We can also use these programs to demonstrate the use of
a script interpreter. To do this we create a script whose
&quot;interpreter&quot; is our myecho program:</p>

<p>$ cat &gt; script.sh #! ./myecho script-arg ^D $ chmod
+x script.sh</p>

<p>We can then use our program to exec the script:</p>

<p>$ ./execve ./script.sh argv[0]: ./myecho argv[1]:
script-arg argv[2]: ./script.sh argv[3]: hello argv[4]:
world</p>
