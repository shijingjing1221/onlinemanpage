<p>WCRTOMB(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual WCRTOMB(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME wcrtomb - convert a wide-character code to a
character (restartable)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</p>

<p>size_t wcrtomb(char *restrict s, wchar_t wc, mbstate_t
*restrict ps);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION If s is a null pointer, the wcrtomb()
function shall be equivalent to the call:</p>

<p>wcrtomb(buf, , ps)</p>

<p>where buf is an internal buffer.</p>

<p>If s is not a null pointer, the wcrtomb() function shall
determine the number of bytes needed to represent the
character that corresponds to the wide character given by wc
(including any shift sequences), and store the resulting
bytes in the array whose first element is pointed to by s.
At most {MB_CUR_MAX} bytes are stored. If wc is a null wide
character, a null byte shall be stored, preceded by any
shift sequence needed to restore the initial shift state.
The resulting state described shall be the initial
conversion state.</p>

<p>If ps is a null pointer, the wcrtomb() function shall
use its own internal mbstate_t object, which is initialized
at program start-up to the initial conversion state.
Otherwise, the mbstate_t object pointed to by ps shall be
used to completely describe the current conversion state of
the associated character sequence. The implementation shall
behave as if no function defined in this volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001 calls wcrtomb().</p>

<p>If the application uses any of the
_POSIX_THREAD_SAFE_FUNCTIONS or _POSIX_THREADS functions,
the application shall ensure that the wcr- tomb() function
is called with a non-NULL ps argument.</p>

<p>The behavior of this function shall be affected by the
LC_CTYPE cate- gory of the current locale.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The wcrtomb() function shall return the
number of bytes stored in the array object (including any
shift sequences). When wc is not a valid wide character, an
encoding error shall occur. In this case, the func- tion
shall store the value of the macro [EILSEQ] in errno and
shall return (size_t)-1; the conversion state shall be
undefined.</p>

<p>ERRORS The wcrtomb() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL ps points to an object that contains an invalid
conversion state.</p>

<p>EILSEQ Invalid wide-character code is detected.</p>
