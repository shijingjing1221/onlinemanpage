<p>NAMED-CHECKCONF(8) BIND9 NAMED-CHECKCONF(8)</p>

<p>NAME named-checkconf - named configuration file syntax
checking tool</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS named-checkconf [-h] [-v] [-j] [-t directory]
{filename} [-p] [-z]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION named-checkconf checks the syntax, but not
the semantics, of a named configuration file. The file is
parsed and checked for syntax errors, along with all files
included by it. If no file is specified, /etc/named.conf is
read by default.</p>

<p>Note: files that named reads in separate parser
contexts, such as rndc.key and bind.keys, are not
automatically read by named-checkconf. Configuration errors
in these files may cause named to fail to run, even if
named-checkconf was successful. named-checkconf can be run
on these files explicitly, however.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -h Print the usage summary and exit.</p>

<p>-t directory Chroot to directory so that include
directives in the configuration file are processed as if run
by a similarly chrooted named.</p>

<p>-v Print the version of the named-checkconf program and
exit.</p>

<p>-p Print out the named.conf and included files in
canonical form if no errors were detected.</p>

<p>-z Perform a test load of all master zones found in
named.conf.</p>

<p>-j When loading a zonefile read the journal if it
exists.</p>

<p>filename The name of the configuration file to be
checked. If not specified, it defaults to
/etc/named.conf.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUES named-checkconf returns an exit status of
1 if errors were detected and 0 otherwise.</p>
