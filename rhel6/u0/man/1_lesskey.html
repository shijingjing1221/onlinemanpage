<p>LESSKEY(1) LESSKEY(1)</p>

<p>NAME lesskey - specify key bindings for less</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS lesskey [-o output] [--] [input] lesskey
[--output=output] [--] [input] lesskey -V lesskey
--version</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Lesskey is used to specify a set of key
bindings to be used by less. The input file is a text file
which describes the key bindings, If the input file is
&quot;-&quot;, standard input is read. If no input file is
speci- fied, a standard filename is used as the name of the
input file, which depends on the system being used: On Unix
systems, $HOME/.lesskey is used; on MS-DOS systems,
$HOME/_lesskey is used; and on OS/2 systems
$HOME/lesskey.ini is used, or $INIT/lesskey.ini if $HOME is
undefined. The output file is a binary file which is used by
less. If no output file is specified, and the environment
variable LESSKEY is set, the value of LESSKEY is used as the
name of the output file. Otherwise, a standard filename is
used as the name of the output file, which depends on the
system being used: On Unix and OS-9 systems, $HOME/.less is
used; on MS-DOS systems, $HOME/_less is used; and on OS/2
systems, $HOME/less.ini is used, or $INIT/less.ini if $HOME
is undefined. If the output file already exists, lesskey
will overwrite it.</p>

<p>The -V or --version option causes lesskey to print its
version number and immediately exit. If -V or --version is
present, other options and arguments are ignored.</p>

<p>The input file consists of one or more sections. Each
section starts with a line that identifies the type of
section. Possible sections are:</p>

<p>#command Defines new command keys.</p>

<p>#line-edit Defines new line-editing keys.</p>

<p>#env Defines environment variables.</p>

<p>Blank lines and lines which start with a pound sign (#)
are ignored, except for the special section header
lines.</p>

<p>COMMAND SECTION The command section begins with the
line</p>

<p>#command</p>

<p>If the command section is the first section in the file,
this line may be omitted. The command section consists of
lines of the form:</p>

<p>string &lt;whitespace&gt; action [extra-string]
&lt;newline&gt;</p>

<p>Whitespace is any sequence of one or more spaces and/or
tabs. The string is the command key(s) which invoke the
action. The string may be a single command key, or a
sequence of up to 15 keys. The action is the name of the
less action, from the list below. The characters in the
string may appear literally, or be prefixed by a caret to
indicate a control key. A backslash followed by one to three
octal digits may be used to specify a character by its octal
value. A backslash fol- lowed by certain characters
specifies input characters as follows:</p>

<p>BACKSPACE</p>

<p>\ ESCAPE</p>

<p>NEWLINE</p>

<p>RETURN</p>

<p>TAB</p>

<p>UP ARROW</p>

<p>DOWN ARROW</p>

<p>RIGHT ARROW</p>

<p>LEFT ARROW</p>

<p>PAGE UP</p>

<p>PAGE DOWN</p>

<p>HOME</p>

<p>END</p>

<p>DELETE</p>

<p>A backslash followed by any other character indicates
that character is to be taken literally. Characters which
must be preceded by backslash include caret, space, tab and
the backslash itself.</p>

<p>An action may be followed by an &quot;extra&quot;
string. When such a command is entered while running less,
the action is performed, and then the extra string is
parsed, just as if it were typed in to less. This feature
can be used in certain cases to extend the functionality of
a command. For example, see the &quot;{&quot; and
&quot;:t&quot; commands in the example below. The extra
string has a special meaning for the &quot;quit&quot;
action: when less quits, first character of the extra string
is used as its exit status.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE The following input file describes the set of
default command keys used by less:</p>

<p>#commandforw-line forw-line e forw-line j forw-line
forw-line ^E forw-line ^N forw-line k back-line y back-line

<p>PRECEDENCE Commands specified by lesskey take precedence
over the default com- mands. A default command key may be
disabled by including it in the input file with the action
&quot;invalid&quot;. Alternatively, a key may be defined to
do nothing by using the action &quot;noaction&quot;.
&quot;noaction&quot; is similar to &quot;invalid&quot;, but
less will give an error beep for an &quot;invalid&quot;
command, but not for a &quot;noaction&quot; command. In
addition, ALL default commands may be disabled by adding
this control line to the input file:</p>

<p>#stop</p>

<p>This will cause all default commands to be ignored. The
#stop line should be the last line in that section of the
file.</p>

<p>Be aware that #stop can be dangerous. Since all default
commands are disabled, you must provide sufficient commands
before the #stop line to enable all necessary actions. For
example, failure to provide a &quot;quit&quot; command can
lead to frustration.</p>

<p>LINE EDITING SECTION The line-editing section begins
with the line:</p>

<p>#line-edit</p>

<p>This section specifies new key bindings for the line
editing commands, in a manner similar to the way key
bindings for ordinary commands are specified in the #command
section. The line-editing section consists of a list of keys
and actions, one per line as in the example below.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE The following input file describes the set of
default line-editing keys used by less:</p>

<p>#line-edit forw-complete 17 back-complete \
back-complete ^L expand ^V literal ^A literal \l right right
\h left left \b word-left \ word-left \w word-right \
word-right \i insert \x delete delete \X word-delete \kx
word-delete \ word-backspace \0 home home \$ end end \k up
up \j down</p>

<p>LESS ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The environment variable
section begins with the line</p>

<p>#env</p>

<p>Following this line is a list of environment variable
assignments. Each line consists of an environment variable
name, an equals sign (=) and the value to be assigned to the
environment variable. White space before and after the
equals sign is ignored. Variables assigned in this way are
visible only to less. If a variable is specified in the
system environment and also in a lesskey file, the value in
the lesskey file takes precedence. Although the lesskey file
can be used to over- ride variables set in the environment,
the main purpose of assigning variables in the lesskey file
is simply to have all less configuration information stored
in one file.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE The following input file sets the -i option
whenever less is run, and specifies the character set to be
&quot;latin1&quot;:</p>

<p>#env LESS = -i LESSCHARSET = latin1</p>

<p>SEE ALSO less(1)</p>

<p>WARNINGS It is not possible to specify special keys,
such as uparrow, in a key- board-independent manner. The
only way to specify such keys is to specify the escape
sequence which a particular keyboard sends when such a key
is pressed.</p>

<p>On MS-DOS and OS/2 systems, certain keys send a sequence
of characters which start with a NUL character (0). This NUL
character should be represented as 340 in a lesskey
file.</p>
