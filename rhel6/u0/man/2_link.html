<p>LINK(2) Linux Programmer s Manual LINK(2)</p>

<p>NAME link - make a new name for a file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>int link(const char *oldpath, const char *newpath);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION link() creates a new link (also known as a
hard link) to an existing file.</p>

<p>If newpath exists it will not be overwritten.</p>

<p>This new name may be used exactly as the old one for any
operation; both names refer to the same file (and so have
the same permissions and ownership) and it is impossible to
tell which name was the &quot;original&quot;.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, zero is returned. On error, -1
is returned, and errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS EACCES Write access to the directory containing
newpath is denied, or search permission is denied for one of
the directories in the path prefix of oldpath or newpath.
(See also path_resolu- tion(7).)</p>

<p>EEXIST newpath already exists.</p>

<p>EFAULT oldpath or newpath points outside your accessible
address space.</p>

<p>EIO An I/O error occurred.</p>

<p>ELOOP Too many symbolic links were encountered in
resolving oldpath or newpath.</p>

<p>EMLINK The file referred to by oldpath already has the
maximum number of links to it.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG oldpath or newpath was too long.</p>

<p>ENOENT A directory component in oldpath or newpath does
not exist or is a dangling symbolic link.</p>

<p>ENOMEM Insufficient kernel memory was available.</p>

<p>ENOSPC The device containing the file has no room for
the new directory entry.</p>

<p>ENOTDIR A component used as a directory in oldpath or
newpath is not, in fact, a directory.</p>

<p>EPERM oldpath is a directory.</p>

<p>EPERM The file system containing oldpath and newpath
does not support the creation of hard links.</p>

<p>EROFS The file is on a read-only file system.</p>

<p>EXDEV oldpath and newpath are not on the same mounted
file system. (Linux permits a file system to be mounted at
multiple points, but link() does not work across different
mount points, even if the same file system is mounted on
both.)</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO SVr4, 4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001 (but see
NOTES).</p>

<p>NOTES Hard links, as created by link(), cannot span file
systems. Use sym- link(2) if this is required.</p>

<p>POSIX.1-2001 says that link() should dereference oldpath
if it is a symbolic link. However, since kernel 2.0, Linux
does not do so: if oldpath is a symbolic link, then newpath
is created as a (hard) link to the same symbolic link file
(i.e., newpath becomes a symbolic link to the same file that
oldpath refers to). Some other implementations behave in the
same manner as Linux. POSIX.1-2008 changes the specifi-
cation of link(), making it implementation-dependent whether
or not oldpath is dereferenced if it is a symbolic link. For
precise control over the treatment of symbolic links when
creating a link, see linkat(2).</p>

<p>BUGS On NFS file systems, the return code may be wrong
in case the NFS server performs the link creation and dies
before it can say so. Use stat(2) to find out if the link
got created.</p>
