<p>NAME libcurl-errors - error codes in libcurl</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This man page includes most, if not all,
available error codes in libcurl. Why they occur and
possibly what you can do to fix the prob- lem are also
included.</p>

<p>CURLcode Almost all &quot;easy&quot; interface functions
return a CURLcode error code. No matter what, using the
curl_easy_setopt(3) option CURLOPT_ERRORBUFFER is a good
idea as it will give you a human readable error string that
may offer more details about the cause of the error than
just the error code. curl_easy_strerror(3) can be called to
get an error string from a given CURLcode number.</p>

<p>CURLcode is one of the following:</p>

<p>CURLE_OK (0) All fine. Proceed as usual.</p>

<p>CURLE_UNSUPPORTED_PROTOCOL (1) The URL you passed to
libcurl used a protocol that this libcurl does not support.
The support might be a compile-time option that you didnt
use, it can be a misspelled protocol string or just a
protocol libcurl has no code for.</p>

<p>CURLE_FAILED_INIT (2) Very early initialization code
failed. This is likely to be an internal error or
problem.</p>

<p>CURLE_URL_MALFORMAT (3) The URL was not properly
formatted.</p>

<p>CURLE_COULDNT_RESOLVE_PROXY (5) Couldn t resolve proxy.
The given proxy host could not be resolved.</p>

<p>CURLE_COULDNT_RESOLVE_HOST (6) Couldnt resolve host. The
given remote host was not resolved.</p>

<p>CURLE_COULDNT_CONNECT (7) Failed to connect() to host or
proxy.</p>

<p>CURLE_FTP_WEIRD_SERVER_REPLY (8) After connecting to a
FTP server, libcurl expects to get a cer- tain reply back.
This error code implies that it got a strange or bad reply.
The given remote server is probably not an OK FTP
server.</p>

<p>CURLE_REMOTE_ACCESS_DENIED (9) We were denied access to
the resource given in the URL. For FTP, this occurs while
trying to change to the remote directory.</p>

<p>CURLE_FTP_WEIRD_PASS_REPLY (11) After having sent the
FTP password to the server, libcurl expects a proper reply.
This error code indicates that an unex- pected code was
returned.</p>

<p>CURLE_FTP_WEIRD_PASV_REPLY (13) libcurl failed to get a
sensible result back from the server as a response to either
a PASV or a EPSV command. The server is flawed.</p>

<p>CURLE_FTP_WEIRD_227_FORMAT (14) FTP servers return a
227-line as a response to a PASV command. If libcurl fails
to parse that line, this return code is passed back.</p>

<p>CURLE_FTP_CANT_GET_HOST (15) An internal failure to
lookup the host used for the new connec- tion.</p>

<p>CURLE_FTP_COULDNT_SET_TYPE (17) Received an error when
trying to set the transfer mode to binary or ASCII.</p>

<p>CURLE_PARTIAL_FILE (18) A file transfer was shorter or
larger than expected. This hap- pens when the server first
reports an expected transfer size, and then delivers data
that doesn t match the previously given size.</p>

<p>CURLE_FTP_COULDNT_RETR_FILE (19) This was either a weird
reply to a RETR command or a zero byte transfer
complete.</p>

<p>CURLE_QUOTE_ERROR (21) When sending custom
&quot;QUOTE&quot; commands to the remote server, one of the
commands returned an error code that was 400 or higher (for
FTP) or otherwise indicated unsuccessful completion of the
command.</p>

<p>CURLE_HTTP_RETURNED_ERROR (22) This is returned if
CURLOPT_FAILONERROR is set TRUE and the HTTP server returns
an error code that is &gt;= 400. (This error code was
formerly known as CURLE_HTTP_NOT_FOUND.)</p>

<p>CURLE_WRITE_ERROR (23) An error occurred when writing
received data to a local file, or an error was returned to
libcurl from a write callback.</p>

<p>CURLE_UPLOAD_FAILED (25) Failed starting the upload. For
FTP, the server typically denied the STOR command. The error
buffer usually contains the servers explanation for this.
(This error code was formerly known as
CURLE_FTP_COULDNT_STOR_FILE.)</p>

<p>CURLE_READ_ERROR (26) There was a problem reading a
local file or an error returned by the read callback.</p>

<p>CURLE_OUT_OF_MEMORY (27) A memory allocation request
failed. This is serious badness and things are severely
screwed up if this ever occurs.</p>

<p>CURLE_OPERATION_TIMEDOUT (28) Operation timeout. The
specified time-out period was reached according to the
conditions.</p>

<p>CURLE_FTP_PORT_FAILED (30) The FTP PORT command returned
error. This mostly happens when you haven t specified a good
enough address for libcurl to use. See CURLOPT_FTPPORT.</p>

<p>CURLE_FTP_COULDNT_USE_REST (31) The FTP REST command
returned error. This should never happen if the server is
sane.</p>

<p>CURLE_RANGE_ERROR (33) The server does not support or
accept range requests.</p>

<p>CURLE_HTTP_POST_ERROR (34) This is an odd error that
mainly occurs due to internal confu- sion.</p>

<p>CURLE_SSL_CONNECT_ERROR (35) A problem occurred
somewhere in the SSL/TLS handshake. You really want the
error buffer and read the message there as it pinpoints the
problem slightly more. Could be certificates (file formats,
paths, permissions), passwords, and others.</p>

<p>CURLE_FTP_BAD_DOWNLOAD_RESUME (36) Attempting FTP resume
beyond file size.</p>

<p>CURLE_FILE_COULDNT_READ_FILE (37) A file given with
FILE:// couldnt be opened. Most likely because the file path
doesnt identify an existing file. Did you check file
permissions?</p>

<p>CURLE_LDAP_CANNOT_BIND (38) LDAP cannot bind. LDAP bind
operation failed.</p>

<p>CURLE_LDAP_SEARCH_FAILED (39) LDAP search failed.</p>

<p>CURLE_FUNCTION_NOT_FOUND (41) Function not found. A
required zlib function was not found.</p>

<p>CURLE_ABORTED_BY_CALLBACK (42) Aborted by callback. A
callback returned &quot;abort&quot; to libcurl.</p>

<p>CURLE_BAD_FUNCTION_ARGUMENT (43) Internal error. A
function was called with a bad parameter.</p>

<p>CURLE_INTERFACE_FAILED (45) Interface error. A specified
outgoing interface could not be used. Set which interface to
use for outgoing connections source IP address with
CURLOPT_INTERFACE. (This error code was formerly known as
CURLE_HTTP_PORT_FAILED.)</p>

<p>CURLE_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS (47) Too many redirects. When
following redirects, libcurl hit the maximum amount. Set
your limit with CURLOPT_MAXREDIRS.</p>

<p>CURLE_UNKNOWN_TELNET_OPTION (48) An option set with
CURLOPT_TELNETOPTIONS was not recog- nized/known. Refer to
the appropriate documentation.</p>

<p>CURLE_TELNET_OPTION_SYNTAX (49) A telnet option string
was Illegally formatted.</p>

<p>CURLE_PEER_FAILED_VERIFICATION (51) The remote server s
SSL certificate or SSH md5 fingerprint was deemed not
OK.</p>

<p>CURLE_GOT_NOTHING (52) Nothing was returned from the
server, and under the circum- stances, getting nothing is
considered an error.</p>

<p>CURLE_SSL_ENGINE_NOTFOUND (53) The specified crypto
engine wasnt found.</p>

<p>CURLE_SSL_ENGINE_SETFAILED (54) Failed setting the
selected SSL crypto engine as default!</p>

<p>CURLE_SEND_ERROR (55) Failed sending network data.</p>

<p>CURLE_RECV_ERROR (56) Failure with receiving network
data.</p>

<p>CURLE_SSL_CERTPROBLEM (58) problem with the local client
certificate.</p>

<p>CURLE_SSL_CIPHER (59) Couldnt use specified cipher.</p>

<p>CURLE_SSL_CACERT (60) Peer certificate cannot be
authenticated with known CA certifi- cates.</p>

<p>CURLE_BAD_CONTENT_ENCODING (61) Unrecognized transfer
encoding.</p>

<p>CURLE_LDAP_INVALID_URL (62) Invalid LDAP URL.</p>

exceeded.</p>

<p>CURLE_USE_SSL_FAILED (64) Requested FTP SSL level
failed.</p>

<p>CURLE_SEND_FAIL_REWIND (65) When doing a send operation
curl had to rewind the data to retransmit, but the rewinding
operation failed.</p>

<p>CURLE_SSL_ENGINE_INITFAILED (66) Initiating the SSL
Engine failed.</p>

<p>CURLE_LOGIN_DENIED (67) The remote server denied curl to
login (Added in 7.13.1)</p>

<p>CURLE_TFTP_NOTFOUND (68) File not found on TFTP
server.</p>

<p>CURLE_TFTP_PERM (69) Permission problem on TFTP

<p>CURLE_REMOTE_FILE_EXISTS (73) File already exists and
will not be overwritten.</p>

<p>CURLE_TFTP_NOSUCHUSER (74) This error should never be

<p>CURLE_OBSOLETE* These error codes will never be
returned. They were used in an old libcurl version and are
currently unused.</p>

<p>CURLMcode This is the generic return code used by
functions in the libcurl multi interface. Also consider
curl_multi_strerror(3).</p>

<p>CURLM_CALL_MULTI_PERFORM (-1) This is not really an
error. It means you should call curl_multi_perform(3) again
without doing select() or similar in between.</p>

<p>CURLM_BAD_HANDLE (1) The passed-in handle is not a valid
CURLM handle.</p>
