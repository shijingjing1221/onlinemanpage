<p>NAME macptopbm - convert a MacPaint file into a PBM
image</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS macptopbm [-extraskip N] [macpfile]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>macptopbmreads a MacPaint file as input and produces a
PBM image as output.</p>

<p>OPTIONS You can abbreviate any option to its shortest
unique prefix.</p>

<p>-extraskip This option is to get around a problem with
some methods of transferring files from the Mac world to the
Unix world. Most of these methods leave the Mac files alone,
but a few of them add the finderinfo data onto the front of
the Unix file. This means an extra 128 bytes to skip over
when reading the file. The symptom to watch for is that the
resulting PBM file looks shifted to one side. If you get
this, try -extraskip 128, and if that still doesnt look
right try another value.</p>
