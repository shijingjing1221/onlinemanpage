<p>NAME ldapcompare - LDAP compare tool</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ldapcompare [-n] [-v] [-z] [-M[M]] [-d
debuglevel] [-D binddn] [-W] [-w passwd] [-y passwdfile] [-H
ldapuri] [-h ldaphost] [-p ldapport] [-P {2|3}] [-e
[!]ext[=extparam]] [-E [!]ext[=extparam]] [-O security-
properties] [-I] [-Q] [-U authcid] [-R realm] [-x] [-X
authzid] [-Y mech] [-Z[Z]] DN {attr:value |
attr::b64value}</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION ldapcompare is a shell-accessible interface
to the ldap_compare_ext(3) library call.</p>

<p>ldapcompare opens a connection to an LDAP server, binds,
and performs a compare using specified parameters. The DN
should be a distinguished name in the directory. Attr should
be a known attribute. If followed by one colon, the
assertion value should be provided as a string. If followed
by two colons, the base64 encoding of the value is provided.
The result code of the compare is provided as the exit code
and, unless ran with -z, the program prints TRUE, FALSE, or
UNDEFINED on standard output.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -n Show what would be done, but dont actually
perform the compare. Useful for debugging in conjunction
with -v.</p>

<p>-v Run in verbose mode, with many diagnostics written to
standard output.</p>

<p>-z Run in quiet mode, no output is written. You must
check the return status. Useful in shell scripts.</p>

<p>-M[M] Enable manage DSA IT control. -MM makes control
critical.</p>

<p>-d debuglevel Set the LDAP debugging level to
debuglevel. ldapcompare must be compiled with LDAP_DEBUG
defined for this option to have any effect.</p>

<p>-x Use simple authentication instead of SASL.</p>

<p>-D binddn Use the Distinguished Name binddn to bind to
the LDAP directory. For SASL binds, the server is expected
to ignore this value.</p>

<p>-W Prompt for simple authentication. This is used
instead of spec- ifying the password on the command
line.</p>

<p>-w passwd Use passwd as the password for simple
authentication.</p>

<p>-y passwdfile Use complete contents of passwdfile as the
password for simple authentication. Note that complete means
that any leading or trailing whitespaces, including
newlines, will be considered part of the password and,
unlike other software, they will not be stripped. As a
consequence, passwords stored in files by commands like
echo(1) will not behave as expected, since echo(1) by
default appends a trailing newline to the echoed string. The
recommended portable way to store a cleartext password in a
file for use with this option is to use slappasswd(8) with
{CLEART- EXT} as hash and the option -n.</p>

<p>-H ldapuri Specify URI(s) referring to the ldap
server(s); only the proto- col/host/port fields are allowed;
a list of URI, separated by whitespace or commas is
expected.</p>

<p>-h ldaphost Specify an alternate host on which the ldap
server is running. Deprecated in favor of -H.</p>

<p>-p ldapport Specify an alternate TCP port where the ldap
server is listen- ing. Deprecated in favor of -H.</p>

<p>-P {2|3} Specify the LDAP protocol version to use.</p>

<p>-e [!]ext[=extparam]</p>

<p>-E [!]ext[=extparam]</p>

<p>Specify general extensions with -e and search extensions
with -E. &acute;!&acute; indicates criticality.</p>

<p>General extensions: [!]assert=&lt;filter&gt; (an RFC
4515 Filter) [!]authzid=&lt;authzid&gt;
(&quot;dn:&lt;dn&gt;&quot; or &quot;u:&lt;user&gt;&quot;)
[!]manageDSAit [!]noop ppolicy [!]postread[=&lt;attrs&gt;]
(a comma-separated attribute list)
[!]preread[=&lt;attrs&gt;] (a comma-separated attribute
list) abandon, cancel (SIGINT sends abandon/cancel; not
really controls)</p>

<p>Search extensions: [!]domainScope (domain scope)
[!]mv=&lt;filter&gt; (matched values filter)
[!]pr=&lt;size&gt;[/prompt|noprompt] (paged results/prompt)
[!]sss=[-]&lt;attr[:OID]&gt;[/[-]&lt;attr[:OID]&gt;...]
(server side sorting) [!]subentries[=true|false]
(subentries) [!]sync=ro[/&lt;cookie&gt;] (LDAP Sync
refreshOnly) rp[/&lt;cookie&gt;][/&lt;slimit&gt;] (LDAP Sync
refreshAndPersist)</p>

<p>-O security-properties Specify SASL security
properties.</p>

<p>-I Enable SASL Interactive mode. Always prompt. Default
is to prompt only as needed.</p>

<p>-Q Enable SASL Quiet mode. Never prompt.</p>

<p>-U authcid Specify the authentication ID for SASL bind.
The form of the ID depends on the actual SASL mechanism
used.</p>

<p>-R realm Specify the realm of authentication ID for SASL
bind. The form of the realm depends on the actual SASL
mechanism used.</p>

<p>-X authzid Specify the requested authorization ID for
SASL bind. authzid must be one of the following formats:
dn:&lt;distinguished name&gt; or u:&lt;username&gt;</p>

<p>-Y mech Specify the SASL mechanism to be used for
authentication. If it s not specified, the program will
choose the best mechanism the server knows.</p>

<p>-Z[Z] Issue StartTLS (Transport Layer Security) extended
operation. If you use -ZZ, the command will require the
operation to be suc- cessful.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES ldapcompare
&quot;uid=babs,dc=example,dc=com&quot; sn:Jensen ldapcompare
&quot;uid=babs,dc=example,dc=com&quot; sn::SmVuc2Vu are all
equivalent.</p>

<p>LIMITATIONS Requiring the value be passed on the command
line is limiting and introduces some security concerns. The
command should support a mecha- nism to specify the location
(file name or URL) to read the value from.</p>
