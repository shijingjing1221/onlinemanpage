<p>CGRULES.CONF(5) libcgroup Manual CGRULES.CONF(5)</p>

<p>NAME cgrules.conf - libcgroup configuration file</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION cgrules.conf configuration file is used by
libcgroups to define the control groups to which the process
belongs to.</p>

<p>The file the contains list of rules which assign to a
defined group/user a control group in a subsystem (or
control groups in subsys- tems)</p>

<p>Rules have two formats:</p>

<p>&lt;user&gt; &lt;controllers&gt; &lt;destination&gt;
&lt;user&gt;:&lt;process name&gt; &lt;controllers&gt;
&lt;destination&gt;</p>

<p>Where:</p>

<p>user can be: - an user name - a group name, with @group
syntax - the wildcard *, for any user or group - %, which is
equivalent to &quot;ditto&quot; (useful for multi-line rules
where different cgroups need to be specified for various
hierarchies for a single user)</p>

<p>process name is optional and it can be: - a process name
- a full command path of a process</p>

<p>controllers can be: - comma separated controller names
(no spaces) or - * (for all mounted controllers)</p>

<p>destination can be: - path relative to the controller
hierarchy (ex. pgrp1/gid1/uid1)</p>

<p>First rule which matches the criteria will be
executed.</p>

<p>Any text starting with # is considered as a start of
comment line and is ignored.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES student devices /usergroup/students the
processes of user student in the subsystem device belong to
the control group /usergroup/students.</p>

<p>student:cp devices /usergroup/students/cp the cp command
processes of user student in the subsystem device belong to
the control group /usergroup/students/cp.</p>

<p>@admin * admingroup/ the processes which belong to group
admin in all subsystems belongs to the control group
/admingroup.</p>

<p>peter cpu test1/ % memory test2/ First line says Peters
task for cpu controller belongs to test1 con- trol group
second line says put Peter s tasks for memory controller
belongs to test2/ control group</p>

<p>* * default/ all processes belong in all subsystems to
the control group default/. Because there is applied the
first task which is find - it has a sense to have this row
at the end of list to put the tasks which was not men-
tioned in the previous rules to the default/ control
group.</p>
