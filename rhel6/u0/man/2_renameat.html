<p>RENAMEAT(2) Linux Programmer s Manual RENAMEAT(2)</p>

<p>NAME renameat - rename a file relative to directory file
descriptors</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #define _ATFILE_SOURCE #include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;
/* Definition of AT_* constants */ #include
&lt;stdio.h&gt;</p>

<p>int renameat(int olddirfd, const char *oldpath, int
newdirfd, const char *newpath);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The renameat() system call operates in
exactly the same way as rename(2), except for the
differences described in this manual page.</p>

<p>If the pathname given in oldpath is relative, then it is
interpreted relative to the directory referred to by the
file descriptor olddirfd (rather than relative to the
current working directory of the calling process, as is done
by rename(2) for a relative pathname).</p>

<p>If oldpath is relative and olddirfd is the special value
AT_FDCWD, then oldpath is interpreted relative to the
current working directory of the calling process (like
rename(2)).</p>

<p>If oldpath is absolute, then olddirfd is ignored.</p>

<p>The interpretation of newpath is as for oldpath, except
that a relative pathname is interpreted relative to the
directory referred to by the file descriptor newdirfd.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, renameat() returns 0. On error,
-1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The same errors that occur for rename(2) can also
occur for renameat(). The following additional errors can
occur for renameat():</p>

<p>EBADF olddirfd or newdirfd is not a valid file
descriptor.</p>

<p>ENOTDIR oldpath is relative and olddirfd is a file
descriptor referring to a file other than a directory; or
similar for newpath and newdirfd</p>

<p>VERSIONS renameat() was added to Linux in kernel
2.6.16.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO POSIX.1-2008.</p>

<p>NOTES See openat(2) for an explanation of the need for
renameat().</p>
