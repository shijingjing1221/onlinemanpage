<p>NAME avahi-daemon.conf - avahi-daemon configuration
file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS /etc/avahi/avahi-daemon.conf</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION avahi-daemon.conf is the configuration file
for avahi-daemon.</p>

<p>SECTION [SERVER] host-name= Set the host name
avahi-daemon tries to register on the LAN. If omited
defaults to the system host name as set with the sethost-
name() system call.</p>

<p>domain-name= Set the default domain name avahi-daemon
tries to register its host name and services on the LAN in.
If omitted defaults to &quot;.local&quot;.</p>

<p>browse-domains= Set a comma seperated list of browsing
domains (in addition to the default one and those announced
inside the default browsing domain). Please note that the
user may specify additional browsing domains on the client
side, either by setting $AVAHI_BROWSE_DOMAINS to a list of
colon seperated domains or by adding them to the XDG config
file ~/.config/avahi/browse-domains (seperated by
newlines).</p>

<p>use-ipv4= Takes a boolean value (&quot;yes&quot; or
&quot;no&quot;). If set to &quot;no&quot; avahi- daemon will
not use IPv4 sockets. Default is &quot;yes&quot;.</p>

<p>use-ipv6= Takes a boolean value (&quot;yes&quot; or
&quot;no&quot;). If set to &quot;no&quot; avahi- daemon will
not use IPv6 sockets. Default is &quot;yes&quot;.</p>

<p>allow-interfaces= Set a comma seperated list of allowed
network inter- faces that should be used by the
avahi-daemon. Other interfaces will be ignored. If set to
the empty list all local interfaces except loopback and
point-to-point will be used.</p>

<p>deny-interfaces= Set a comma seperated list of network
interfaces that should be ignored by avahi-daemon. Other not
specified interfaces will be used, unless allow-interfaces
is set. This option takes precedence over
deny-interfaces.</p>

<p>check-response-ttl= Takes a boolean value
(&quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;). If set to
&quot;yes&quot;, an additional security check is activated:
incoming IP packets will be ignored unless the IP TTL is
255. Earlier mDNS specifications required this check. Since
this feature may be incompatible with newer implementations
of mDNS it defaults to &quot;no&quot;. On the other hand it
pro- vides extra security.</p>

<p>use-iff-running= Takes a boolean value (&quot;yes&quot;
or &quot;no&quot;). If set to &quot;yes&quot; avahi-daemon
monitors the IFF_RUNNING flag bit which is used by some
(modern) network drivers to tell user space if a network
cable is plugged in (in case of copper ethernet), or the
network card is associ- ated with some kind of network (in
case of WLAN). If IFF_RUNNING is set avahi-daemon will
automatically announce its services on that network.
Unfortunately far too many network drivers do not support
this flag or support it in a broken way. Therefore this
option defaults to &quot;no&quot;.</p>

<p>enable-dbus= Takes either &quot;yes&quot;,
&quot;no&quot; or &quot;warn&quot;. If set to
&quot;yes&quot; avahi- daemon connects to D-Bus, offering an
object oriented client API. It is only available if Avahi
has been compiled with --enable-dbus in which case it
defaults to &quot;yes&quot;. &quot;warn&quot; behaves like
&quot;yes&quot;, but the daemon starts up even when it fails
to connect to a D-Bus daemon. In addition, if the connection
to the D-Bus daemon is terminated we try to recon- nect.
(Unless we are in a chroot() environment where this
definitely will fail.)</p>

<p>disallow-other-stacks= Takes a boolean value
(&quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;). If set to
&quot;yes&quot; no other process is allowed to bind to UDP
port 5353. This effec- tively impedes other mDNS stacks from
running on the host. Use this as a security measure to make
sure that only Avahi is responsible for mDNS traffic. Please
note that we do not recommend running multiple mDNS stacks
on the same host simultaneously. This hampers reliability
and is a waste of resources. However, to not annoy people
this option defaults to &quot;no&quot;.</p>

<p>allow-point-to-point= Takes a boolean value
(&quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;). If set to
&quot;yes&quot; avahi-daemon will make use of interfaces
with the POINTOPOINT flag set. This option defaults to
&quot;no&quot; as it might make mDNS unreliable due to
usually large latencies with such links and opens a
potential security hole by allowing mDNS access from
Internet connections. Use with care and YMMV!</p>

<p>SECTION [WIDE-AREA] enable-wide-area= Takes a boolean
value (&quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;). Enable wide- area
DNS-SD, aka DNS-SD over unicast DNS. If this is enabled only
domains ending in .local will be resolved on mDNS, all other
domains are resolved via unicast DNS. If you want to
maintain multiple differ- ent multicast DNS domains even
with this option enabled we encourage you to use subdomains
of .local, such as &quot;kitchen.local&quot;. This option
defaults to &quot;yes&quot;.</p>

<p>SECTION [PUBLISH] disable-publishing= Takes a boolean
value (&quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;). If set to
&quot;yes&quot;, no record will be published by Avahi, not
even address records for the local host. Avahi will be
started in a querying-only mode. Use this is a security
measure. This option defaults to &quot;no&quot;</p>

<p>disable-user-service-publishing= Takes a boolean value
(&quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;). If set to
&quot;yes&quot;, Avahi will still publish address records
and suchlike but will not allow user applications to publish
services. Use this is a security measure. This option
defaults to &quot;no&quot;</p>

<p>add-service-cookie= Takes a boolean value
(&quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;). If set to
&quot;yes&quot; an implicit TXT entry will be added to all
locally registered services, containing a cookie value which
is chosen randomly on daemon startup. This can be used to
detect if two services on two different interfaces/protocols
are actually identical. Defaults to &quot;no&quot;.</p>

<p>publish-addresses= Takes a boolean value
(&quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;). If set to
&quot;yes&quot; avahi-daemon will register mDNS address
records for all local IP addresses. Unless you want to use
avahi-daemon exclusively for browsing it s recommended to
enable this. If you plan to register local services you need
to enable this option. Defaults to &quot;yes&quot;.</p>

<p>publish-hinfo= Takes a boolean value (&quot;yes&quot; or
&quot;no&quot;). If set to &quot;yes&quot; avahi-daemon will
register an mDNS HINFO record on all interfaces which
contains information about the local operating system and
CPU, which might be useful for administrative purposes. This
is recommended by the mDNS specification but not required.
For the sake of privacy you might choose to disable this
feature. Defaults to &quot;yes.&quot;</p>

<p>publish-workstation= Takes a boolean value
(&quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;). If set to
&quot;yes&quot; avahi-daemon will register a service of type
&quot;_workstation._tcp&quot; on the local LAN. This might
be useful for administrative purposes (i.e. browse for all
PCs on the LAN), but is not required or recom- mended by any
specification. Newer MacOS X releases register a service of
this type. Defaults to &quot;yes&quot;.</p>

<p>publish-domain= Takes a boolean value (&quot;yes&quot;
or &quot;no&quot;). If set to &quot;yes&quot; avahi-daemon
will announce the locally used domain name (see above) for
browsing by other hosts. Defaults to &quot;yes&quot;.</p>

<p>publish-dns-servers= Takes a comma seperated list of IP
addresses for unicast DNS servers. You can use this to
announce unicast DNS servers via mDNS. When used in
conjunction with avahi-dnsconfd on the client side this
allows DHCP-like configuration of unicast DNS servers.</p>

<p>publish-resolv-conf-dns-servers= Takes a boolean value
(&quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;). If set to
&quot;yes&quot; avahi-daemon will publish the unicast DNS
servers spec- ified in /etc/resolv.conf in addition to those
specified with publish- dns-servers. Send avahi-daemon a
SIGHUP to have it reload this file. Defaults to
&quot;no&quot;.</p>

<p>publish-aaaa-on-ipv4= Takes a boolean value
(&quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;). If set to
&quot;yes&quot; avahi-daemon will publish an IPv6 AAAA
record via IPv4, i.e. the local IPv6 addresses can be
resolved using an IPv4 transport. Only use- ful when IPv4 is
enabled with use-ipv4=true. Defaults to &quot;yes&quot;.</p>

<p>publish-a-on-ipv6= Takes a boolean value
(&quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;). If set to
&quot;yes&quot; avahi-daemon will publish an IPv4 A record
via IPv6, i.e. the local IPv4 addresses can be resolved
using an IPv6 transport. Only use- ful when IPv6 is enabled
with use-ipv6=true. Defaults to &quot;no&quot;.</p>

<p>SECTION [REFLECTOR] enable-reflector= Takes a boolean
value (&quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;). If set to
&quot;yes&quot; avahi-daemon will reflect incoming mDNS
requests to all local network interfaces, effectively
allowing clients to browse mDNS/DNS-SD services on all
networks connected to the gateway. The gateway is some- what
intelligent and should work with all kinds of mDNS traffic,
though some functionality is lost (specifically the unicast
reply bit, which is used rarely anyway). Make sure to not
run multiple reflectors between the same networks, this
might cause them to play Ping Pong with mDNS packets.
Defaults to &quot;no&quot;.</p>

<p>reflect-ipv= Takes a boolean value (&quot;yes&quot; or
&quot;no&quot;). If set to &quot;yes&quot; and
enable-reflector is enabled, avahi-daemon will forward mDNS
traffic between IPv4 and IPv6, which is usually not
recommended. Defaults to &quot;no&quot;.</p>

<p>SECTION [RLIMITS] This section is used to define system
resource limits for the daemon. See setrlimit(2) for more
information. If any of the options is not specified in the
configuration file, avahi-daemon does not change it from the
system defaults.</p>

<p>rlimit-as= Value in bytes for RLIMIT_AS (maximum size of
the processs virtual memory). Sensible values are heavily
system dependent.</p>

<p>rlimit-core= Value in bytes for RLIMIT_CORE (maximum
core file size). Unless you want to debug avahi-daemon, it
is safe to set this to 0.</p>

<p>rlimit-data= Value in bytes for RLIMIT_DATA (maximum
size of the pro- cess s data segment). Sensible values are
heavily system dependent.</p>

<p>rlimit-fsize= Value for RLIMIT_FSIZE (maximum size of
files the process may create). Since avahi-daemon shouldnt
write any files to disk, it is safe to set this to 0.</p>

<p>rlimit-nofile= Value for RLIMIT_NOFILE (open file
descriptors). avahi- daemon shouldn t need more than 15 to
20 open file descriptors concur- rently.</p>

<p>rlimit-stack= Value in bytes for RLIMIT_STACK (maximum
size of the pro- cess stack). Sensible values are heavily
system dependent.</p>

<p>rlimit-nproc= Value for RLIMIT_NPROC (number of process
of user). avahi-daemon forks of a helper process on systems
where chroot(2) is available. Therefore this value should
not be set below 2.</p>
