<p>NAME xmlto - apply an XSL stylesheet to an XML
document</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS xmlto [-o output_dir] [-x custom_xsl] [-m
xsl_fragment] [-v] [-p postprocessor_opts] [--extensions]
[--searchpath path] [--skip-validation] [--stringparam
paramname=paramvalue] [--noclean] [--noautosize]
[--with-fop] [--with-dblatex] {format} {file}</p>

<p>xmlto {[--help] | [--version]}</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The purpose of xmlto is to convert an XML
file to the desired format using whatever means necessary.
This may involve two steps:</p>

<p>1. The application of an appropriate XSL stylesheet
using an XSL-T processor.</p>

<p>2. Further processing with other tools. This step may
not be necessary.</p>

<p>To decide which stylesheet to use and what, if any,
needs to be done to post-process the output, xmlto makes use
of format scripts, which are simple shell scripts that xmlto
calls during the conversion.</p>

<p>The appropriate format script is selected based on the
type of XML file and the desired output format. xmlto comes
with some format scripts for converting DocBook XML files to
a variety of formats. You may specify your own format script
by using an absolute filename for format on the command
line.</p>

<p>Firstly, if xmlto has not been told explicitly which
stylesheet to use (with the -x option), the format script
will be called with $1 set to stylesheet. The environment
variable XSLT_PROCESSOR contains the base name of the
executable that will be used to perform the XSL-T
transformation (for example xsltproc). The format script
should write the name of the stylesheet to use to standard
output and exit successfully, or exit with a non-zero return
code if there is no appropriate stylesheet to use (for
example, if the only available stylesheet is known not to
work with the XSL-T processor that will be used). If nothing
is written to standard output but the script exits
successfully, no XSL-T transformation will be performed.</p>

<p>Secondly, after an XSL-T processor has been run using
the stylesheet, the format script will be called again, this
time with $1 set to post-process. The format script should
perform any necessary steps to translate the XSL-T processed
output into the desired output format, including copying the
output to the desired output directory. For post-processing,
the format script is run in a temporary directory containing
just the processed output (whose name is stored in
XSLT_PROCESSED and whose basename is that of the original
XML file with any filename extension replaced with .proc).
INPUT_FILE is set to the name of the original XML file,
OUTPUT_DIR is set to the name of the directory that the
output (and only the output) must end up in, and SEARCHPATH
is set to a colon-separate list of fallback directories in
which to look for input (for images, for example). If this
step is unsuccessful the format script should exit with a
non-zero return code.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -v Be verbose (-vv for very verbose).</p>

<p>-x stylesheet Use stylesheet instead of asking the
format script to choose one.</p>

<p>-m fragment Use the provided XSL fragment to modify the
stylesheet.</p>

<p>-o directory Put output in the specified directory
instead of the current working directory.</p>

<p>-p postprocessor_opts Pass postprocessor_opts to
processing stages after stylesheet application (e.g. lynx or
links when going through HTML to text, or xmltex when going
from through TeX to DVI). If -p is specified a second time,
the options specified will be passed to second-stage
postprocessing; presently this is only applicable when going
through xmltex and dvips to PostScript.</p>

<p>--extensions Turn on stylesheet extensions for the tool
chain in use (for example, this might turn on
passivetex.extensions and use.extensions if PassiveTeX is
being used). The variables turned on are the ones used by
Norman Walsh&acute;s DocBook XSL stylesheets.</p>

<p>--searchpath path Add the colon-separated list of
directories in path as fallback directories for including
input.</p>

<p>--skip-validation Skip the validation step that is
normally performed.</p>

<p>--stringparam paramname=paramvalue Pass a named
parameter paramname with value paramvalue to stylesheet from
the command line.</p>

<p>--noclean Temporary files are not deleted(their names
are shown and kept in tmp directory). It could help with
analyzing problems.</p>

<p>--noautosize By default, some XSL variables are
overriden by autodetection (page.width and page.height for
paperconf (libpaper) use, paper.type for locale-based
(LC_PAPER) selection). With this option, xmlto doesnt use
this autodetection and user is able to modify defaults
himself (either via default param.xsl modification or by
user-defined XSL fragment).</p>

<p>--with-fop Use fop for formatting. It is an experimental
option, expects fop in specific location(detected at
configured time), could be changed manually in xmlto script
by modification of FOP_PATH</p>

<p>--with-dblatex Use dblatex for formatting. It is an
experimental option, expects dblatex in specific
location(detected at configured time), could be changed
manually in xmlto script by modification of DBLATEX_PATH</p>

<p>--help Display a short usage message. It will describe
xmlto&acute;s options, and the available output formats.</p>

<p>--version Display the version number of xmlto.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT XSLT_PROCESSOR Base name of the executable
that will be used to perform the XSL-T transformation
(default: xsltproc(1)).</p>

<p>TMPDIR Directory, where to create temporary stylesheets
(default: /tmp).</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS 0 Everything went fine. This is the expected
exit code.</p>

<p>1 xmlto was called with insufficient arguments.</p>

<p>2 mktemp(1) failed to create a file/directory. Make sure
/tmp or TMPDIR is writable.</p>

<p>3 xmlto failed to find some binary on configured
location. Make sure that all required packages are installed
and paths in xmlto script are set properly.</p>

<p>10+(Validation non-zero error code) xmlto tried to
validate a xml document, but validation failed. For better
diagnostic, validation output and xmllint exit code is
provided. Consider either fixing your document or using
--skip-validation.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES To convert a DocBook XML document to PDF,
use:</p>

<p>xmlto pdf mydoc.xml</p>

<p>To convert a DocBook XML document to HTML and store the
resulting HTML files in a separate directory use:</p>

<p>xmlto -o html-dir html mydoc.xml</p>

<p>To convert a DocBook XML document to a single HTML file
use:</p>

<p>xmlto html-nochunks mydoc.xml</p>

<p>To modify the output using an XSL fragment use:</p>

<p>xmlto -m ulink.xsl pdf mydoc.xml</p>

<p>To specify which stylesheet to use (overriding the one
that the format script would choose) use:</p>

<p>xmlto -x mystylesheet.xsl pdf mydoc.xml</p>
