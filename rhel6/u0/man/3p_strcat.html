<p>STRCAT(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual STRCAT(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME strcat - concatenate two strings</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;string.h&gt;</p>

<p>char *strcat(char *restrict s1, const char *restrict
s2);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The strcat() function shall append a copy of
the string pointed to by s2 (including the terminating null
byte) to the end of the string pointed to by s1. The initial
byte of s2 overwrites the null byte at the end of s1. If
copying takes place between objects that overlap, the
behavior is undefined.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The strcat() function shall return s1; no
return value is reserved to indicate an error.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE This issue is aligned with the ISO C
standard; this does not affect compatibility with XPG3
applications. Reliable error detection by this function was
never guaranteed.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>

Std 1003.1-2001, &lt;string.h&gt;</p>
