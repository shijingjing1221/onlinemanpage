<p>NAME radvd - router advertisement daemon for IPv6</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS radvd [ -hsv ] [ -d debuglevel ] [ -C
configfile ] [ -p pidfile ] [ -m logmethod ] [ -l logfile ]
[ -f facility ] [ -t chrootdir ] [ -u user- name ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION radvd is the router advertisement daemon for
IPv6. It listens to router solicitations and sends router
advertisements as described in &quot;Neighbor Discovery for
IP Version 6 (IPv6)&quot; (RFC 4861). With these advertise-
ments hosts can automatically configure their addresses and
some other parameters. They also can choose a default router
based on these adver- tisements.</p>

<p>Note that if debugging is not enabled, radvd will not
start if IPv6 forwarding is disabled. IPv6 forwarding can be
controlled via sysctl(8), net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding on
Linux or net.inet6.ip6.for- warding on BSD.</p>

<p>Similarly, the configuration file must not be writable
by others, and if non-root operation is requested, not even
by self/own group.</p>

<p>OPTIONS For every one character option there is also a
long option, which is listed right next to the
&quot;short&quot; option name:</p>

<p>-v, --version Displays the version of radvd and then
aborts.</p>

<p>-h, --help Displays a short usage description and then
aborts.</p>

<p>-s, --singleprocess On Linux if username is specified,
privilege separation is enabled and there will be two
processes. This option disables privilege separation, and as
a result, the non-privileged radvd process does not have
permissions to change interface configura- tion.</p>

<p>-d debuglevel, --debug debuglevel With this option you
turn on debugging information. The debug- ging level is an
integer in the range from 1 to 5, from quiet to very
verbose. A debugging level of 0 completely turns off
debugging. If a debugging level greater than 0 is used,
radvd doesnt background itself on start. The default
debugging level is 0.</p>

<p>-C configfile, --config configfile Specifies an
alternate config file. Normally the compiled in default
/etc/radvd.conf is used.</p>

<p>-p pidfile, --pidfile pidfile Specifies an alternate
pidfile. Normally the compiled in default
/var/run/radvd/radvd.pid is used.</p>

<p>-m method, --logmethod method Specifies the logging
method to use. Possibly values are:</p>

<p>none Completely disables any logging.</p>

<p>logfile Logs to the logfile which is specified by the -l
option. If no logfile is specified on the command line, then
a compiled in default is used (see next option).</p>

<p>stderr Logs to standard error.</p>

<p>stderr_syslog Logs only the high messages (of at least
LOG_ERR prior- ity) to standard error, and everything to
syslog (default method).</p>

<p>syslog Logs to syslog.</p>

<p>-l logfile, --logfile logfile Specifies the logfile to
use when using the logging method log- file. The default
logfile is /var/log/radvd.log.</p>

<p>-f facility, --facility facility Specifies the facility
(as an integer) when using syslog log- ging. Default is
LOG_DAEMON.</p>

<p>-t chrootdir, --chrootdir chrootdir If specified,
switches to chrootdir before doing anything else. This
directory and its subdirectories must have been populated
first. For security reasons, -u must always be used when
using chrootdir.</p>

<p>Note that on Linux radvd requires access to the /proc
filesys- tem, so it is more challenging to set up the chroot
environment.</p>

<p>-u username, --username username If specified, drops
root privileges and changes user ID to user- name and group
ID to the primary group of username. This is recommended for
security reasons. You might also need to use -p to point to
a file in a username -writable directory (e.g.
/var/run/radvd/radvd.pid).</p>

<p>FILES /usr/sbin/radvd /etc/radvd.conf
/var/run/radvd/radvd.pid /var/log/radvd.log</p>

<p>BUGS There certainly are some bugs. If you find them or
have other sugges- tions please contact Pekka Savola
