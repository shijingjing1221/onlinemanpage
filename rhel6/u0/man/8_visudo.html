<p>VISUDO(8) MAINTENANCE COMMANDS VISUDO(8)</p>

<p>NAME visudo - edit the sudoers file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS visudo [-c] [-q] [-s] [-V] [-f sudoers]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION visudo edits the sudoers file in a safe
fashion, analogous to vipw(8). visudo locks the sudoers file
against multiple simultaneous edits, provides basic sanity
checks, and checks for parse errors. If the sudoers file is
currently being edited you will receive a message to try
again later.</p>

<p>There is a hard-coded list of editors that visudo will
use set at compile-time that may be overridden via the
editor sudoers Default variable. This list defaults to the
path to vi(1) on your system, as determined by the configure
script. Normally, visudo does not honor the VISUAL or EDITOR
environment variables unless they contain an editor in the
aforementioned editors list. However, if visudo is
configured with the --with-enveditor option or the
env_editor Default variable is set in sudoers, visudo will
use any the editor defines by VISUAL or EDITOR. Note that
this can be a security hole since it allows the user to
execute any program they wish simply by setting VISUAL or
EDITOR.</p>

<p>visudo parses the sudoers file after the edit and will
not save the changes if there is a syntax error. Upon
finding an error, visudo will print a message stating the
line number(s) where the error occurred and the user will
receive the &quot;What now?&quot; prompt. At this point the
user may enter &quot;e&quot; to re-edit the sudoers file,
&quot;x&quot; to exit without saving the changes, or
&quot;Q&quot; to quit and save changes. The &quot;Q&quot;
option should be used with extreme care because if visudo
believes there to be a parse error, so will sudo and no one
will be able to sudo again until the error is fixed. If
&quot;e&quot; is typed to edit the sudoers file after a
parse error has been detected, the cursor will be placed on
the line where the error occurred (if the editor supports
this feature).</p>

<p>OPTIONS visudo accepts the following command line
options:</p>

<p>-c Enable check-only mode. The existing sudoers file
will be checked for syntax and a message will be printed to
the standard output detailing the status of sudoers. If the
syntax check completes successfully, visudo will exit with a
value of 0. If a syntax error is encountered, visudo will
exit with a value of 1.</p>

<p>-f sudoers Specify and alternate sudoers file location.
With this option visudo will edit (or check) the sudoers
file of your choice, instead of the default, /etc/sudoers.
The lock file used is the specified sudoers file with
&quot;.tmp&quot; appended to it.</p>

<p>-q Enable quiet mode. In this mode details about syntax
errors are not printed. This option is only useful when
combined with the -c option.</p>

<p>-s Enable strict checking of the sudoers file. If an
alias is used before it is defined, visudo will consider
this a parse error. Note that it is not possible to
differentiate between an alias and a hostname or username
that consists solely of uppercase letters, digits, and the
underscore (_) character.</p>

<p>-V The -V (version) option causes visudo to print its
version number and exit.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT The following environment variables may be
consulted depending on the value of the editor and
env_editor sudoers variables:</p>

<p>VISUAL Invoked by visudo as the editor to use</p>

<p>EDITOR Used by visudo if VISUAL is not set</p>

<p>FILES /etc/sudoers List of who can run what</p>

<p>/etc/sudoers.tmp Lock file for visudo</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS sudoers file busy, try again later. Someone
else is currently editing the sudoers file.</p>

<p>/etc/sudoers.tmp: Permission denied You didnt run visudo
as root.</p>

<p>Cant find you in the passwd database Your userid does
not appear in the system passwd file.</p>

<p>Warning: {User,Runas,Host,Cmnd}_Alias referenced but not
defined Either you are trying to use an undeclare
{User,Runas,Host,Cmnd}_Alias or you have a user or hostname
listed that consists solely of uppercase letters, digits,
and the underscore (_) character. In the latter case, you
can ignore the warnings (sudo will not complain). In -s
(strict) mode these are errors, not warnings.</p>

<p>Warning: unused {User,Runas,Host,Cmnd}_Alias The
specified {User,Runas,Host,Cmnd}_Alias was defined but never
used. You may wish to comment out or remove the unused
alias. In -s (strict) mode this is an error, not a
warning.</p>

<p>CAVEATS There is no easy way to prevent a user from
gaining a root shell if the editor used by visudo allows
shell escapes.</p>
