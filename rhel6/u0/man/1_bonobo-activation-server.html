<p>Bonobo Activation Server(1) Bonobo Activation
Server(1)</p>

<p>NAME bonobo-activation-server - GNOME component
tracker</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This application tracks information about
installed components and bro- kers components, in
conjunction with its client library; libbonobo-
activation.</p>

<p>It reads the component descriptions from ${pre-
fix}/lib/bonobo/servers/*.server. These files provide an XML
descrip- tion of a components capabilities which can be
queried and manipulated by clients from the client
library.</p>

<p>Bonobo-activation-server also ensures that the minimum
neccessary num- ber of servers for your display setup are
running.</p>

<p>Bonobo-activation-server executes all components with
the environment inherited from the first process to start
the server. In addition to using your prefix, it will
examine the BONOBO_ACTIVATION_PATH and the GNOME2_PATH
environment variables to find .server files.</p>

<p>In addition it examines an XML configuration file in
${pre-
fix}/etc/bonobo-activation/bonobo-activation-config.xml</p>
