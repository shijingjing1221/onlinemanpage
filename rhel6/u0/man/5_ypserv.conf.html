<p>YPSERV.CONF(5) Reference Manual YPSERV.CONF(5)</p>

<p>NAME ypserv.conf - configuration file for ypserv and
rpc.ypxfrd</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION ypserv.conf is an ASCII file which contains
some options for ypserv. It also contains a list of rules
for special host and map access for ypserv and rpc.ypxfrd.
This file will be read by ypserv and rpc.ypxfrd at startup,
or when receiving a SIGHUP signal.</p>

<p>There is one entry per line. If the line is a option
line, the format is:</p>

<p>option: &lt;argument&gt;</p>

<p>The line for an access rule has the format:</p>

<p>host:domain:map:security</p>

<p>All rules are tried one by one. If no match is found,
access to a map is allowed.</p>

<p>Following options exist:</p>

<p>files: 30 This option specifies, how many database files
should be cached by ypserv. If 0 is specified, caching is
disabled. Decreasing this number is only possible, if ypserv
is restarted.</p>

<p>trusted_master: server If this option is set on a slave
server, new maps from the host server will be accepted as
master. The default is, that no trusted master is set and
new maps will not be accepted. Example: trusted_master:
ypmaster.example.org</p>

<p>slp: [yes|&lt;no&gt;|domain] If this option is enabled
and SLP support compiled in, the NIS server registers itself
on a SLP server. If the variable is set to domain, an
attribute domain with a comma seperated list of supported
domainnames is set. Else this attribute will not be set.</p>

<p>xfr_check_port: [&lt;yes&gt;|no] With this option
enabled, the NIS master server have to run on a port &lt;
1024. The default is &quot;yes&quot; (enabled).</p>

<p>The field descriptions for the access rule lines
are:</p>

<p>host IP address. Wildcards are allowed. Examples:
131.234. = 131.234.0.0/255.255.0.0
131.234.214.0/255.255.254.0</p>

<p>domain specifies the domain, for which this rule should
be applied. An asterix as wildcard is allowed.</p>

<p>map name of the map, or asterisk for all maps.</p>

<p>security one of none, port, deny:</p>

<p>none always allow access.</p>

<p>port allow access if from port &lt; 1024. Otherwise do
not allow access.</p>

<p>deny deny access to this map.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/ypserv.conf</p>

<p>SEE ALSO ypserv(8), rpc.ypxfrd(8)</p>

<p>WARNINGS The access rules for special maps are no real
improvement in security, but they make the life a little bit
harder for a potential hacker.</p>

<p>BUGS Solaris clients don t use privileged ports. All
security options which depend on privileged ports cause big
problems on Solaris clients.</p>
