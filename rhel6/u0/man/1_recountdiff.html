<p>NAME recountdiff - recompute patch counts and
offsets</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS recountdiff [file...]</p>

<p>recountdiff {[--help] | [--version]}</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION recountdiff recomputes the counts and
offsets in unified context diffs. It does this in two
passes: first the counts are corrected by inspection of the
actual patch lines, and then the offsets are adjusted
according to the computed counts.</p>

<p>The corrected diff is sent to standard output.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --help Display a short usage message.</p>

<p>--version Display the version number of recountdiff.</p>

<p>LIMITATIONS There are some things that cannot be dealt
with. If you have removed the first context line in a hunk,
for example, there is no way for recountdiff to know that.
For more precise fixing up, use rediff(1), which uses the
original and modified diffs.</p>
