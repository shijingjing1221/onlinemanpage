<p>NAME amanda-archive-format - Format of amanda archive
streams</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The Amanda archive format is designed to be
a simple, efficient means of interleaving multiple
simultaneous files, allowing an arbitrary number of data
streams for a file. It is a streaming format in the sense
that the writer need not know the size of files until they
are completely written to the archive, and the reader can
process the archive in constant space.</p>

<p>DATA MODEL The data stored in an archive consists of an
unlimited number of files. Each file consists of a number of
&quot;attributes&quot;, each identified by a 16-bit ID. Each
attribute can contain an unlimited amount of data.</p>

<p>Attribute IDs less than 16 (AMAR_ATTR_APP_START) are
reserved for special purposes, but the remaining IDs are
available for application-specific uses.</p>

<p>STRUCTURE RECORDS A record can be either a header record
or a data record. A header record serves as a
&quot;checkpoint&quot; in the file, with a magic value that
can be used to recognize archive files.</p>

<p>A header record has a fixed size of 28 bytes, as
follows:</p>

<p>28 bytes: magic string The magic string is the ASCII
text &quot;AMANDA ARCHIVE FORMAT &quot; followed by a
decimal representation of the format version number
(currently &acute;1&acute;), padded to 28 bytes with NUL
bytes.</p>

<p>A data record has a variable size, as follows:</p>

<p>2 bytes: file number 2 bytes: attribute ID 4 bytes: data
size (N) N bytes: data The file number and attribute ID
serve to identify the data stream to which this data
belongs. The low 31 bits of the data size give the number of
data bytes following, while the high bit (the EOA bit)
indicates the end of the attribute, as described below.
Because records are generally read into memory in their
entirety, the data size must not exceed 4MB (4194304 bytes).
All integers are in network byte order.</p>

<p>A header record is distinguished from a data record by
the magic string. The file number 0x414d, corresponding to
the characters &quot;AM&quot;, is forbidden and must be
skipped on writing.</p>

<p>Attribute ID 0 (AMAR_ATTR_FILENAME) gives the filename
of a file. This attribute is mandatory for each file, must
be nonempty, must fit in a single record, and must precede
any other attributes for the same file in the archive. The
filename should be a printable string (ASCII or UTF-8), to
facilitate use of generic archive-display utilities, but the
format permits any nonempty bytestring. The filename cannot
span multiple records.</p>

<p>Attribute ID 1 (AMAR_ATTR_EOF) signals the end of a
file. This attribute must contain no data, but should have
the EOA bit set.</p>

<p>CONNECTION TO DATA MODEL Each file in an archive is
assigned a file number distinct from any other active file
in the archive. The first record for a file must have
attribute ID 0 (AMAR_ATTR_FILENAME), indicating a filename.
A file ends with an empty record with ID 1 (AMAR_ATTR_EOF).
For every file at which a reader might want to begin
reading, the filename record should be preceded by a header
record. How often to write header records is left to the
discretion of the application.</p>

<p>All data records with the same file number and attribute
ID are considered a part of the same attribute. The
boundaries between such records are not significant to the
contents of the attribute, and both readers and writers are
free to alter such boundaries as necessary.</p>

<p>The final data record for each attribute has the high
bit (the EOA bit) of its data size field set. A writer must
not reuse an attribute ID within a file. An attribute may be
terminated by a record containing both data and an EOA bit,
or by a zero-length record with its EOA bit set.</p>
