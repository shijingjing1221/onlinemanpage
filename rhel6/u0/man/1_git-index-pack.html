<p>GIT-INDEX-PACK(1) Git Manual GIT-INDEX-PACK(1)</p>

<p>NAME git-index-pack - Build pack index file for an
existing packed archive</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS git index-pack [-v] [-o &lt;index-file&gt;]
&lt;pack-file&gt; git index-pack --stdin [--fix-thin]
[--keep] [-v] [-o &lt;index-file&gt;]
[&lt;pack-file&gt;]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Reads a packed archive (.pack) from the
specified file, and builds a pack index file (.idx) for it.
The packed archive together with the pack index can then be
placed in the objects/pack/ directory of a git
repository.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -v Be verbose about what is going on, including
progress status.</p>

<p>-o &lt;index-file&gt; Write the generated pack index
into the specified file. Without this option the name of
pack index file is constructed from the name of packed
archive file by replacing .pack with .idx (and the program
fails if the name of packed archive does not end with
.pack).</p>

<p>--stdin When this flag is provided, the pack is read
from stdin instead and a copy is then written to
&lt;pack-file&gt;. If &lt;pack-file&gt; is not specified,
the pack is written to objects/pack/ directory of the
current git repository with a default name determined from
the pack content. If &lt;pack-file&gt; is not specified
consider using --keep to prevent a race condition between
this process and git repack.</p>

<p>--fix-thin Fix a &quot;thin&quot; pack produced by git
pack-objects --thin (see git- pack-objects(1) for details)
by adding the excluded objects the deltified objects are
based on to the pack. This option only makes sense in
conjunction with --stdin.</p>

<p>--keep Before moving the index into its final
destination create an empty .keep file for the associated
pack file. This option is usually necessary with --stdin to
prevent a simultaneous git repack process from deleting the
newly constructed pack and index before refs can be updated
to use objects contained in the pack.</p>

<p>--keep=why Like --keep create a .keep file before moving
the index into its final destination, but rather than
creating an empty file place why followed by an LF into the
.keep file. The why message can later be searched for within
all .keep files to locate any which have outlived their
usefulness.</p>

<p>--index-version=&lt;version&gt;[,&lt;offset&gt;] This is
intended to be used by the test suite only. It allows to
force the version for the generated pack index, and to force
64-bit index entries on objects located above the given
offset.</p>

<p>--strict Die, if the pack contains broken objects or
links.</p>

<p>NOTE Once the index has been created, the list of object
names is sorted and the SHA1 hash of that list is printed to
stdout. If --stdin was also used then this is prefixed by
either &quot;pack&quot;, or &quot;keep&quot; if a new .keep
file was successfully created. This is useful to remove a
.keep file used as a lock to prevent the race with git
repack mentioned above.</p>
