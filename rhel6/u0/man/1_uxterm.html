<p>NAME uxterm - X terminal emulator for Unicode (UTF-8)
environments</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS uxterm [ xterm-options ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION uxterm is a wrapper around the xterm(1)
program that invokes the latter program with the UXTerm X
resource class set. All arguments to uxterm are passed to
xterm without processing; the -class and -u8 options should
not be specified because they are used by the wrapper. See
the xterm manual page for more information on
xterm-options.</p>

<p>The environments locale settings (see ENVIRONMENT below)
are used to discern the locales character set. If no current
locale can be deter- mined, the locale en_US (the English
language as used in the terri- tory of the United States) is
assumed. The locale(1) utility is used to determine whether
the system supports the selected locale. If it does not,
uxterm will exit with an error and report the output of
locale.</p>

<p>Note: uxterm may produce unexpected results if the
current locale is set to one in which the UTF-8 character
encoding is not supported, or if fonts using the ISO 10646-1
character set are not available. In the Debian system, the
xfonts-base package provides the fonts that uxterm uses by
default. To change the fonts uxterm uses, edit the
/usr/share/X11/app-defaults/UXTerm file.</p>

<p>A similar wrapper, koi8rxterm(1), is available for
KOI8-R environments.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, LANG The values of these
variables are checked, in order, to deter- mine the
character set used by the current locale.</p>
