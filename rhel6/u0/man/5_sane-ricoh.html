<p>sane-ricoh(5) SANE Scanner Access Now Easy
sane-ricoh(5)</p>

<p>NAME sane-ricoh - SANE backend for Ricoh flatbed
scanners</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sane-ricoh library implements a SANE
(Scanner Access Now Easy) backend that provides access to
the following Ricoh flatbed scanners:</p>

<p>IS50 IS60</p>

<p>DEVICE NAMES This backend expects device names of the
form:</p>

<p>special</p>

<p>Where special is the path-name for the special device
that corresponds to a SCSI scanner. The special device name
must be a generic SCSI device or a symlink to such a device.
The program sane-find-scanner helps to find out the correct
device. Under Linux, such a device name could be /dev/sga or
/dev/sge, for example. See sane-scsi(5) for details.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/sane.d/ricoh.conf The backend configuration
file (see also description of SANE_CONFIG_DIR below).</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-ricoh.a The static library
implementing this backend.</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-ricoh.so The shared library
implementing this backend (present on systems that support
dynamic loading).</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT SANE_CONFIG_DIR This environment variable
specifies the list of directories that may contain the
configuration file. Under UNIX, the directories are
separated by a colon (:), under OS/2, they are separated by
a semi-colon (;). If this variable is not set, the config-
uration file is searched in two default directories: first,
the current working directory (&quot;.&quot;) and then in
/etc/sane.d. If the value of the environment variable ends
with the directory sepa- rator character, then the default
directories are searched after the explicitly specified
directories. For example, setting SANE_CONFIG_DIR to
&quot;/tmp/config:&quot; would result in directories
&quot;tmp/config&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and
&quot;/etc/sane.d&quot; being searched (in this order).</p>

<p>SANE_DEBUG_RICOH If the library was compiled with debug
support enabled, this environment variable controls the
debug level for this backend. Higher debug levels increase
the verbosity of the output.</p>

<p>Example: export SANE_DEBUG_RICOH=4</p>
