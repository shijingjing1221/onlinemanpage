<p>HOSTNAME(1) Linux Programmer s Manual HOSTNAME(1)</p>

<p>NAME hostname - show or set the systems host name
domainname - show or set the systems NIS/YP domain name
dnsdomainname - show the systems DNS domain name

<p>DESCRIPTION Hostname is the program that is used to
either set or display the cur- rent host, domain or node
name of the system. These names are used by many of the
networking programs to identify the machine. The domain name
is also used by NIS/YP.</p>

<p>GET NAME When called without any arguments, the program
displays the current names:</p>

<p>hostname will print the name of the system as returned
by the gethost- name(2) function.</p>

<p>domainname, nisdomainname, ypdomainname will print the
name of the sys- tem as returned by the getdomainname(2)
function. This is also known as the YP/NIS domain name of
the system.</p>

<p>dnsdomainname will print the domain part of the FQDN
(Fully Qualified Domain Name). The complete FQDN of the
system is returned with hostname --fqdn.</p>

<p>The function gethostname(2) is used to get the hostname.
When the hostname -a, -d, -f or -i is called will
gethostbyname(3) be called. The difference in gethostname(2)
and gethostbyname(3) is that gethost- byname(3) is network
aware, so it consults /etc/nsswitch.conf and /etc/host.conf
to decide whether to read information in /etc/syscon-
fig/network or /etc/hosts</p>

<p>To add another dimension to this, the hostname is also
set when the network interface is brought up.</p>

<p>SET NAME When called with one argument or with the
--file option, the commands set the host name, the NIS/YP
domain name or the node name.</p>

<p>Note, that only the super-user can change the names.</p>

<p>It is not possible to set the FQDN or the DNS domain
name with the dns- domainname command (see THE FQDN
below).</p>

<p>The host name is usually set once at system startup in
/etc/rc.d/rc.inet1 or /etc/init.d/boot (normally by reading
the con- tents of a file which contains the host name, e.g.
/etc/hostname).</p>

<p>THE FQDN You cant change the FQDN (as returned by
hostname --fqdn) or the DNS domain name (as returned by
dnsdomainname) with this command. The FQDN of the system is
the name that the resolver(3) returns for the host name.</p>

<p>Technically: The FQDN is the name gethostbyname(2)
returns for the host name returned by gethostname(2). The
DNS domain name is the part after the first dot.</p>

<p>Therefore it depends on the configuration (usually in
/etc/host.conf) how you can change it. Usually (if the hosts
file is parsed before DNS or NIS) you can change it in
/etc/hosts.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -a, --alias Display the alias name of the host
(if used).</p>

<p>-d, --domain Display the name of the DNS domain. Dont
use the command domainname to get the DNS domain name
because it will show the NIS domain name and not the DNS
domain name. Use dnsdomainname instead.</p>

<p>-F, --file filename Read the host name from the
specified file. Comments (lines starting with a #) are
ignored.</p>

<p>-f, --fqdn, --long Display the FQDN (Fully Qualified
Domain Name). A FQDN consists of a short host name and the
DNS domain name. Unless you are using bind or NIS for host
lookups you can change the FQDN and the DNS domain name
(which is part of the FQDN) in the /etc/hosts file.</p>

<p>-h, --help Print a usage message and exit.</p>

<p>-i, --ip-address Display the IP address(es) of the
host.</p>

<p>-s, --short Display the short host name. This is the
host name cut at the first dot.</p>

<p>-V, --version Print version information on standard
output and exit success- fully.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose Be verbose and tell whats going on.</p>

<p>-y, --yp, --nis Display the NIS domain name. If a
parameter is given (or --file name ) then root can also set
a new NIS domain.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/hosts /etc/sysconfig/network</p>

<p>NOTE Note that hostname doesnt change anything
permanently. After reboot original names from /etc/hosts are
used again.</p>
