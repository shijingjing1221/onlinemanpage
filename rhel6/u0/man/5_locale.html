<p>NAME locale - Describes a locale definition file</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The locale definition files contains all the
information that the localedef(1) command needs to convert
it into the binary locale database.</p>

<p>The definition files consist of sections which each
describe a locale category in detail.</p>

<p>Syntax The locale definition file starts with a header
that may consist of the following keywords:</p>

<p>&lt;escape_char&gt; is followed by a character that
should be used as the escape- character for the rest of the
file to mark characters that should be interpreted in a
special way. It defaults to the backslash (.</p>

<p>&lt;comment_char&gt; is followed by a character that
will be used as the comment- character for the rest of the
file. It defaults to the number sign (#).</p>

<p>The locale definition has one part for each locale
category. Each part can be copied from another existing
locale or can be defined from scratch. If the category
should be copied, the only valid keyword in the definition
is copy followed by the name of the locale which should be
copied.</p>

with the string LC_CTYPE in the first column.</p>

letters A through Z are included automatically. Characters
also specified as cntrl, digit, punct, or space are not
allowed.</p>

letters a through z are included automatically. Characters
also specified as cntrl, digit, punct, or space are not

and an uppercase letter separated with a , and enclosed in
parentheses. The mem- bers of the list are separated with
semicolons.</p>

<p>tolower followed by a list of mappings from uppercase to
lowercase let- ters. If the keyword tolower is not present,
the reverse of the toupper list is used.</p>
