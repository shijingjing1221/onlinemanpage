<p>NAME shadow, getspnam - encrypted password file
routines</p>

<p>SYNTAX #include &lt;shadow.h&gt;</p>

<p>struct spwd *getspent();</p>

<p>struct spwd *getspnam(char *name);</p>

<p>void setspent();</p>

<p>void endspent();</p>

<p>struct spwd *fgetspent(FILE *fp);</p>

<p>struct spwd *sgetspent(char *cp);</p>

<p>int putspent(struct spwd *p, FILE *fp);</p>

<p>int lckpwdf();</p>

<p>int ulckpwdf();</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION shadow manipulates the contents of the
shadow password file, /etc/shadow. The structure in the
#include file is:</p>

<p>struct spwd { char *sp_namp; /* user login name */ char
*sp_pwdp; /* encrypted password */ long int sp_lstchg; /*
last password change */ long int sp_min; /* days until
change allowed. */ long int sp_max; /* days before change
required */ long int sp_warn; /* days warning for expiration
*/ long int sp_inact; /* days before account inactive */
long int sp_expire; /* date when account expires */ unsigned
long int sp_flag; /* reserved for future use */ }</p>

<p>The meanings of each field are:</p>

<p>&middot; sp_namp - pointer to null-terminated user
name</p>

<p>&middot; sp_pwdp - pointer to null-terminated
password</p>

<p>&middot; sp_lstchg - days since Jan 1, 1970 password was
last changed</p>

<p>&middot; sp_min - days before which password may not be
changed</p>

<p>&middot; sp_max - days after which password must be
changed</p>

<p>&middot; sp_warn - days before password is to expire
that user is warned of pending password expiration</p>

<p>&middot; sp_inact - days after password expires that
account is considered inactive and disabled</p>

<p>&middot; sp_expire - days since Jan 1, 1970 when account
will be disabled</p>

<p>&middot; sp_flag - reserved for future use</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION getspent, getspname, fgetspent, and
sgetspent each return a pointer to a struct spwd. getspent
returns the next entry from the file, and fgetspent returns
the next entry from the given stream, which is assumed to be
a file of the proper format. sgetspent returns a pointer to
a struct spwd using the provided string as input. getspnam
searches from the current position in the file for an entry
matching name.</p>

<p>setspent and endspent may be used to begin and end,
respectively, access to the shadow password file.</p>

<p>The lckpwdf and ulckpwdf routines should be used to
insure exclusive access to the /etc/shadow file. lckpwdf
attempts to acquire a lock using pw_lock for up to 15
seconds. It continues by attempting to acquire a second lock
using spw_lock for the remainder of the initial 15 seconds.
Should either attempt fail after a total of 15 seconds,
lckpwdf returns -1. When both locks are acquired 0 is
returned.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS Routines return NULL if no more entries are
available or if an error occurs during processing. Routines
which have int as the return value return 0 for success and
-1 for failure.</p>

<p>CAVEATS These routines may only be used by the superuser
as access to the shadow password file is restricted.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/shadow Secure user account information.</p>
