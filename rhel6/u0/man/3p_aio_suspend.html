<p>AIO_SUSPEND(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
AIO_SUSPEND(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME aio_suspend - wait for an asynchronous I/O request
(REALTIME)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;aio.h&gt;</p>

<p>int aio_suspend(const struct aiocb * const list[], int
nent, const struct timespec *timeout);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The aio_suspend() function shall suspend the
calling thread until at least one of the asynchronous I/O
operations referenced by the list argument has completed,
until a signal interrupts the function, or, if timeout is
not NULL, until the time interval specified by timeout has
passed. If any of the aiocb structures in the list
correspond to com- pleted asynchronous I/O operations (that
is, the error status for the operation is not equal to
[EINPROGRESS]) at the time of the call, the function shall
return without suspending the calling thread. The list
argument is an array of pointers to asynchronous I/O control
blocks. The nent argument indicates the number of elements
in the array. Each aiocb structure pointed to has been used
in initiating an asynchronous I/O request via aio_read(),
aio_write(), or lio_listio(). This array may contain NULL
pointers, which are ignored. If this array contains pointers
that refer to aiocb structures that have not been used in
sub- mitting asynchronous I/O, the effect is undefined.</p>

<p>If the time interval indicated in the timespec structure
pointed to by timeout passes before any of the I/O
operations referenced by list are completed, then
aio_suspend() shall return with an error. If the Mono- tonic
Clock option is supported, the clock that shall be used to
mea- sure this time interval shall be the CLOCK_MONOTONIC
clock.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE If the aio_suspend() function returns after
one or more asynchronous I/O operations have completed, the
function shall return zero. Other- wise, the function shall
return a value of -1 and set errno to indicate the
error.</p>

<p>The application may determine which asynchronous I/O
completed by scan- ning the associated error and return
status using aio_error() and aio_return(), respectively.</p>

<p>ERRORS The aio_suspend() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EAGAIN No asynchronous I/O indicated in the list
referenced by list completed in the time interval indicated
by timeout.</p>

<p>EINTR A signal interrupted the aio_suspend() function.
Note that, since each asynchronous I/O operation may
possibly provoke a signal when it completes, this error
return may be caused by the completion of one (or more) of
the very I/O operations being awaited.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The aio_suspend() function is part of
the Asynchronous Input and Output option and need not be
available on all implementations.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
