<p>NAME pnmhistmap - draw a histogram for a PGM or PPM
file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pnmhistmap</p>

<p>[-red] [-green] [-blue]</p>

<p>[-black] [-white]</p>

<p>[-max N]</p>

<p>[-lval] [-rval]</p>

<p>[-height] [-width]</p>

<p>[-dots]</p>

<p>[-verbose]</p>

<p>[pnmfile]</p>

<p>Minimum unique abbreviation of option is acceptable. You
may use dou- ble hyphens instead of single hyphen to denote
options. You may use white space in place of the equals sign
to separate an option name from its value.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pnmhistmap reads a PNM image as input and produces an
image showing a histogram of the color (or gray) values in
the input. A PGM input results in a PBM output. A PPM input
results in a PPM output with three overlaid histograms: a
red one for the red input, a green one for the green input,
and a blue one for the blue input.</p>

<p>For example, from the following image produces the
following histogram:</p>

<p>image histogram from image</p>

<p>If the input is PBM, pnmhistmap produces an error
message and no output image.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -red</p>

<p>-green</p>

<p>-blue Include the indicated color component in the
output. If you specify none of these, pnmhistmap include all
three.</p>

<p>These options are meaningless if the input is PGM.</p>

<p>These options were new in Netpbm 10.26 (January 2005).
Before that, pnmhistmap always included all three color
components.</p>

<p>-dots Plot the histogram as dots. By default, pnmhistmap
plots bars.</p>

<p>Example of dots:.B -dots example</p>

<p>This option was new in Netpbm 10.26 (January 2005).
Before that, pnmhistmap always plotted bars.</p>

<p>-lval minpixval</p>

<p>-rval maxpixval These options specify the range of
intensity values to include. pnmhistmap ignores intensities
less than minpixval and greater than maxpixval. So the left
side of the histogram corresponds to minpixval and the right
side corresponds to maxpixval.</p>

<p>By default, pnmhistmap plots the entire possible range:
zero to the maxval.</p>

<p>These options were new in Netpbm 10.26 (January 2005).
Before that, pnmhistmap always plotted from zero to the
maxval.</p>

<p>-height</p>

<p>-width These options specify the dimensions, in pixels
of the histogram image.</p>

<p>The default height is 200 pixels.</p>

<p>The default width is one pixel for each plotted
intensity value (so it s controlled by the maxval of the
image and the -lval and -rval options). The count buckets in
the histogram are always one pixel wide. If you specify a
width less than the number of plotted intensity values, a
bucket represents more than one intensity value. If you
specify a width greater that the number of plotted intensity
values, some buckets represent no color (the count is
zero).</p>

<p>This option was new in Netpbm 10.26 (January 2005).
Before that, the dimensions were always what the default is
today.</p>

<p>-black Ignore the count of black pixels when scaling the
histogram.</p>

<p>-white Ignore the count of white pixels when scaling the
histogram.</p>

<p>The -black and -white options, which can be used
separately or together, are useful for images with a large
percentage of pix- els whose value is zero or 255, which can
cause the remaining histogram data to become unreadbaly
small. Note that, for color inputs, these options apply to
all colors; if, for example, the input has a large number of
bright-red areas, you will probably want to use the -white
option.</p>

<p>-max N Force the scaling of the histogram to use N as
the largest-count value. This is useful for inputs with a
large percentage of single-color pixels which are not black
or white.</p>

<p>-verbose Report the progress of making the histogram,
including the largest-count value used to scale the
output.</p>

<p>LIMITATIONS pnmhistmap assumes maxval is always 255.
Images with a smaller maxval will only use the lower-value
side of the histogram. You can overcome this either by
piping the input through pamdepth or by cutting and scaling
the lower-value side of the histogram. Neither is a particu-
larly elegant solution to the problem.</p>
