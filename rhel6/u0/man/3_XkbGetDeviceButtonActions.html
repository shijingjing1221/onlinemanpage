<p>XkbGetDeviceButtonActions(3) XKB FUNCTIONS
XkbGetDeviceButtonActions(3)</p>

<p>NAME XkbGetDeviceButtonActions - Query the button
actions associated with an X Input Extension device</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS Status XkbGetDeviceButtonActions (Display *dpy,
XkbDeviceInfoPtr device_info, Bool all_buttons, unsigned int
first_button, unsigned int num_buttons);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS - dpy connection to X server</p>

<p>- device_info structure to update with results</p>

<p>- all_buttons True =&gt; get information for all
buttons</p>

<p>- first_button number of first button for which info is
desired</p>

<p>- num_buttons number of buttons for which info is
desired</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION XkbGetDeviceButtonActions queries the server
for the desired button information for the device indicated
by the device_spec field of device_info and waits for a
reply. If successful, XkbGetDeviceButtonAc- tions backfills
the button actions (btn_acts field of device_info) for only
the requested buttons, updates the name, type, supported,
and unsupported fields, and returns Success.</p>

<p>all_buttons, first_button and num_buttons specify the
device buttons for which actions should be returned. Setting
all_buttons to True requests actions for all device buttons;
if all_buttons is False, first_button and num_buttons
specify a range of buttons for which actions are
requested.</p>

<p>If a compatible version of Xkb is not available in the
server or the Xkb extension has not been properly
initialized, XkbGetDeviceButtonAc- tions returns BadAccess.
If allocation errors occur, a BadAlloc status is returned.
If the specified device (device_info-&gt;device_spec) is
invalid, a BadKeyboard status is returned. If the device has
no but- tons, a BadMatch status is returned. If first_button
and num_buttons specify illegal buttons, a BadValue status
is returned.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS BadAccess The Xkb extension has not been
properly initialized</p>

<p>BadAlloc Unable to allocate storage</p>

<p>BadKeyboard The device specified was not a valid core or
input extension device</p>

<p>BadMatch A compatible version of Xkb was not available
in the server or an argument has correct type and range, but
is otherwise invalid</p>

<p>BadValue An argument is out of range</p>
