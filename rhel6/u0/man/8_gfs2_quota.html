<p>NAME gfs2_quota - Manipulate GFS2 disk quotas</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS gfs2_quota
&lt;list|sync|get|limit|warn|check|init|reset&gt;
[OPTION]...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION gfs2_quota is used to examine and change
quota values in a GFS2 filesystem. This command has a number
of different actions.</p>

<p>GFS2 introduced a new linked list format for the quotas
in the quota file. This list format allows for faster list,
check and init opera- tions. Older GFS2 quota files may be
migrated to this newer format using the gfs2_quota reset
command.</p>

<p>ACTIONS list List the contents of the quota file. Only
IDs that have a non- zero hard limit, warn limit, or value
are printed.</p>

<p>sync Sync any local quota changes to the quota file.</p>

<p>get Get the current data for the ID specified by the -u
or -g argu- ment.</p>

<p>limit Set the current hard limit for the ID specified by
the -u or -g argument to the value specified by the -l
argument on the speci- fied filesystem. The filesystem wont
let the user or group use more than this much space. A value
of zero here means that no limit is enforced.</p>

<p>warn Set the current warn limit for the ID specified by
the -u or -g argument to the value specified by the -l
argument on the speci- fied filesystem. The filesystem will
start complaining to the user or group when more than this
much space is used. A value of zero here means that the user
wont ever be warned.</p>

<p>check Scan a filesystem and make sure that whats out
there on the disk matches whats in the quota file. This is
only accurate if the filesystem is idle when this is
running. If there is a mis- match, it is printed to stdout.
Note: GFS2 quotas are transac- tional and a quota check is
not needed every time there is a system crash.</p>

<p>init Scan a filesystem and initialize the quota file
with the values obtained from the scan. The filesystem
should be idle when this is run. You should only need to do
this if you upgrade a pre- quota GFS2 filesystem (pre-GFS2
5.1).</p>

<p>reset The reset operation will truncate the quota file
and all quota information (values, limits, warnings) will be
lost. All quota limits and warnings will have to be
reassigned after this opera- tion.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -b The units for disk space are filesystem
blocks.</p>

<p>-f Directory Specifies which filesystem to perform the
action on.</p>

<p>-g GID Specifies the group ID for get, limit, or warn.
It can be either the group name from the group file, or the
GID number.</p>

<p>-h Print out a help message describing available
options, then exit.</p>

<p>-k The units for disk space are kilobytes.</p>

<p>-l Size Specifies the new value for the limit or warn
actions. The value is assumed to be in the units specified
by the -m, -k, -s, -b arguments. The default is
megabytes.</p>

<p>-m The units for disk space are megabytes. This is the
default.</p>

<p>-n Dont try to resolve UIDs and GIDs into user and group
names.</p>

<p>-s The units for disk space are sectors (512-byte
blocks).</p>

<p>-u UID Specifies the user ID for get, limit, or warn. It
can be either the username from the password file, or the
UID number.</p>

<p>-V Print program version information, then exit.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE To set the hard limit for user
&quot;nobody&quot; to 1048576 kilobytes on filesystem
/gfs20</p>

<p>gfs2_quota limit -l 1048576 -k -u nobody -f /gfs20</p>
