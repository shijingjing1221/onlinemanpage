<p>NAME native2ascii - Native-to-ASCII Converter</p>

<p>Converts a file with native-encoded characters
(characters which are non-Latin 1 and non-Unicode) to one
with Unicode-encoded characters.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS native2ascii [options] [inputfile
[outputfile]]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The Java compiler and other Java tools can
only process files which contain Latin-1 and/or
Unicode-encoded (dddd notation) characters. native2ascii
converts files which contain other character encodings into
files containing Latin-1 and/or Unicode-encoded
charaters.</p>

<p>If outputfile is omitted, standard output is used for
output. If, in addition, inputfile is omitted, standard
input is used for input.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -reverse Perform the reverse operation: convert
a file with Latin-1 and/or Unicode encoded characters to one
with native-encoded characters.</p>

<p>-encoding encoding_name Specify the encoding name which
is used by the conversion procedure. The default encoding is
taken from System property file.encoding. The encoding_name
string must be taken from the first column of the table of
supported encodings in the Supported Encodings @
http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/intl/encod-
ing.doc.html document.</p>

<p>-Joption Pass option to the Java virtual machine, where
option is one of the options described on the reference page
for the java application launcher. For example, -J-Xms48m
sets the startup memory to 48 megabytes.</p>
