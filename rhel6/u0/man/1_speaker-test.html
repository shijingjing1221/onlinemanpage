<p>NAME speaker-test - command-line speaker test tone
generator for ALSA</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS speaker-test [-options]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION speaker-test generates a tone that can be
used to test the speakers of a computer.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -c | --channels NUM NUM channels in stream</p>

<p>-D | --device NAME PCM device name NAME</p>

<p>-f | --frequency FREQ sine wave of FREQ Hz</p>

<p>--help Print usage help</p>

<p>-b | --buffer TIME Use buffer size of TIME microseconds.
When 0 is given, use the maximal buffer size. The default
value is 0.</p>

<p>-p | --period TIME Use period size of TIME microseconds.
When 0 is given, the periods given by -P option is used. The
default value is 0.</p>

<p>-P | --nperiods ERIODS Use number of periods. The
default value is 4.</p>

<p>-r | --rate RATE stream of RATE Hz</p>

<p>-t | --test pink|sine|wav -t pink means use pink noise
(default).</p>

<p>Pink noise is perceptually uniform noise -- that is, it
sounds like every frequency at once. If you can hear any
tone it may indicate resonances in your speaker system or
room.</p>

<p>-t sine means to use sine wave.</p>

<p>-t wav means to play WAV files, either pre-defined files
or given via -w option.</p>

<p>You can pass the number from 1 to 3 as a backward
compatibility.</p>

<p>-l | --nloops COUNT</p>

<p>Specifies the number of loops. Zero means to run
infinitely.</p>

<p>When -s option below with a valid channel is given,
speaker-test will perform always a single-shot without
looping.</p>

<p>-s | --speaker CHANNEL Do a single-shot speaker test for
the given channel. The chan- nel number starts from 1. The
channel number corresponds to left, right, rear-left,
rear-right, center, LFE, side-left, side-right, and so
on.</p>

<p>For example, when 1 is passed, it tests the left channel
only once rather than both channels with looping.</p>

<p>-w | --wavfile Use the given WAV file for the playback
instead of pre-defined WAV files.</p>

<p>-W | --wavdir Specify the directory containing WAV files
for playback. The default path is
/usr/share/sounds/alsa.</p>

<p>USAGE EXAMPLES Produce stereo sound from one stereo
jack:</p>

<p>speaker-test -Dplug:front -c2</p>

<p>Produce 4 speaker sound from two stereo jacks:</p>

<p>speaker-test -Dplug:surround40 -c4</p>

<p>Produce 5.1 speaker sound from three stereo jacks:</p>

<p>speaker-test -Dplug:surround51 -c6</p>

<p>To send a nice low 75Hz tone to the Woofer and then exit
without touch- ing any other speakers:</p>

<p>speaker-test -Dplug:surround51 -c6 -s1 -f75</p>

<p>AUTHOR The speaker-test program was written by James
Courtier-Dutton. Pink noise support was added by Nathan
Hurst. Further extensions by Takashi Iwai.</p>
