<p>NAME sandbox - Run cmd under an SELinux sandbox</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sandbox [-l level ] [[-M | -X] -H homedir -T
tempdir ] [-I includefile ] [ -W windowmanager ] [[-i file
]...] [ -t type ] cmd</p>

<p>sandbox [-l level ] [[-M | -X] -H homedir -T tempdir ]
[-I includefile ] [ -W windowmanager ] [[-i file ]...] [ -t
type ] -S</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Run the cmd application within a tightly
confined SELinux domain. The default sandbox domain only
allows applications the ability to read and write stdin,
stdout and any other file descriptors handed to it. It is
not allowed to open any other files. The -M option will
mount an alternate homedir and tmpdir to be used by the
sandbox.</p>

<p>If you have the policycoreutils-sandbox package
installed, you can use the -X option and the -M option.
sandbox -X allows you to run X appli- cations within a
sandbox. These applications will start up their own X Server
and create a temporary home directory and /tmp. The default
SELinux policy does not allow any capabilities or network
access. It also prevents all access to the users other
processes and files. Files specified on the command that are
in the home directory or /tmp will be copied into the
sandbox directories.</p>

<p>If directories are specified with -H or -T the directory
will have its context modified with chcon(1) unless a level
is specified with -l. If the MLS/MCS security level is
specified, the user is responsible to set the correct
labels.</p>

<p>-H homedir Use alternate homedir to mount over your home
directory. Defaults to temporary. Requires -X or -M.</p>

<p>-i file Copy this file into the appropriate temporary
sandbox directory. Command can be repeated.</p>

<p>-I inputfile Copy all files listed in inputfile into the
appropriate temporary sandbox directories.</p>

<p>-l Specify the MLS/MCS Security Level to run the sandbox
with. Defaults to random.</p>

<p>-M Create a Sandbox with temporary files for $HOME and
/tmp.</p>

<p>-t type Use alternate sandbox type, defaults to
sandbox_t or sandbox_x_t for -X.</p>

<p>-T tmpdir Use alternate tempory directory to mount on
/tmp. Defaults to tmpfs. Requires -X or -M.</p>

<p>-S Run a full desktop session, Requires level, and home
and tmpdir.</p>

<p>-W windowmanager Select alternative window manager to
run within sandbox -X. Default to
/usr/bin/matchbox-window-manager.</p>

<p>-X Create an X based Sandbox for gui apps, temporary
files for $HOME and /tmp, secondary Xserver, defaults to
sandbox_x_t</p>

<p>-C Use control groups to control this copy of sandbox.
Specify parameters in /etc/sysconfig/sandbox. Max memory
usage and cpu usage are to be specified in percent. You can
specify which CPUs to use by numbering them 0,1,2...
etc.</p>
