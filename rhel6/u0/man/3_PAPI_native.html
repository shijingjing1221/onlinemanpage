<p>NAME PAPI_native - Accessing PAPI native events</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;papi.h&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION In addition to the predefined PAPI preset
events, the PAPI library also exposes a majority of the
events native to each platform. Native events form the basic
building blocks for PAPI presets. They can also be used
directly to access functions specific to a given
platform.</p>

<p>Since native events are by definition specific to each
platform, the names for these events are unique to each
platform. Native events for a given platform can be
discovered by combining the PAPI_enum_event(3) and
PAPI_event_code_to_name(3) or PAPI_get_event_info(3)
functions.</p>

<p>BUGS Not every native event on every platform can be
represented through the native event interface.
Occasionally, exotic but valuable events are not
represented. There is presently no method for representing
these events in a PAPI event set.</p>
