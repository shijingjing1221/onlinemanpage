<p>NAME xfs_copy - copy the contents of an XFS
filesystem</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS xfs_copy [ -bd ] [ -L log ] source target1 [
target2 ... ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION xfs_copy copies an XFS filesystem to one or
more targets in parallel (see xfs(5)). The first (source)
argument must be the pathname of the device or file
containing the XFS filesystem. The remaining arguments
specify one or more target devices or file names. If the
pathnames specify devices, a copy of the source XFS
filesystem is created on each device. The target can also be
the name of a regular file, in which case an image of the
source XFS filesystem is created in that file. If the file
does not exist, xfs_copy creates the file. The length of the
resulting file is equal to the size of the source
filesystem. However, if the file is created on an XFS
filesystem, the file consumes roughly the amount of space
actually used in the source filesystem by the filesystem and
the XFS log. The space saving is because xfs_copy seeks over
free blocks instead of copying them and the XFS filesystem
sup- ports sparse files efficiently.</p>

<p>xfs_copy should only be used to copy unmounted
filesystems, read-only mounted filesystems, or frozen
filesystems (see xfs_freeze(8)). Other- wise, the generated
filesystem(s) would be inconsistent or corrupt.</p>

<p>xfs_copy does not alter the source filesystem in any
way. Each new (target) filesystem is identical to the
original filesystem except that new filesystems each have a
new unique filesystem identifier (UUID). Therefore, if both
the old and new filesystems will be used as separate
distinct filesystems, xfs_copy or xfsdump(8)/xfsrestore(8)
should be used to generate the new filesystem(s) instead of
dd(1) or other pro- grams that do block-by-block disk
copying.</p>

<p>xfs_copy uses synchronous writes to ensure that write
errors are detected.</p>

<p>xfs_copy uses pthreads(7) to perform simultaneous
parallel writes. xfs_copy creates one additional thread for
each target to be written. All threads die if xfs_copy
terminates or aborts.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -d Create a duplicate (true clone) filesystem.
This should be done only if the new filesystem will be used
as a replacement for the original filesystem (such as in the
case of disk replacement).</p>

<p>-b The buffered option can be used to ensure direct IO
is not attempted to any of the target files. This is useful
when the filesystem holding the target file does not support
direct IO.</p>

<p>-L log Specifies the location of the log if the default
location of /var/tmp/xfs_copy.log.XXXXXX is not desired.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS xfs_copy reports errors to both stderr and
in more detailed form to a generated log file whose name is
of the form /var/tmp/xfs_copy.log.XXXXXX or a log file
specified by the -L option. If xfs_copy detects a write
error on a target, the copy of that one target is aborted
and an error message is issued to both stderr and the log
file, but the rest of the copies continue. When xfs_copy
termi- nates, all aborted targets are reported to both
stderr and the log file.</p>

<p>If all targets abort or if there is an error reading the
source filesystem, xfs_copy immediately aborts.</p>

<p>xfs_copy returns an exit code of 0 if all targets are
successfully copied and an exit code of 1 if any target
fails.</p>

<p>NOTES When moving filesystems from one disk to another,
if the original filesystem is significantly smaller than the
new filesystem, and will be made larger, we recommend that
mkfs.xfs(8) and xfsdump(8)/xfsre- store(8) be used instead
of using xfs_copy and xfs_growfs(8). The filesystem layout
resulting from using xfs_copy/xfs_growfs is almost always
worse than the result of using mkfs.xfs/xfsdump/xfsrestore
but in the case of small filesystems, the differences can
have a signifi- cant performance impact. This is due to the
way xfs_growfs(8) works, and not due to any shortcoming in
xfs_copy itself.</p>

<p>CAVEATS xfs_copy does not copy XFS filesystems that have
a real-time section or XFS filesystems with external logs.
In both cases, xfs_copy aborts with an error message.</p>
