<p>NAME iwpriv - configure optionals (private) parameters
of a wireless network interface</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS iwpriv [interface] iwpriv interface
private-command [private-parameters] iwpriv interface
private-command [I] [private-parameters] iwpriv interface
--all</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Iwpriv is the companion tool to iwconfig(8).
Iwpriv deals with parame- ters and setting specific to each
driver (as opposed to iwconfig which deals with generic
ones).</p>

<p>Without any argument, iwpriv list the available private
commands avail- able on each interface, and the parameters
that they require. Using this information, the user may
apply those interface specific commands on the specified
interface.</p>

<p>In theory, the documentation of each device driver
should indicate how to use those interface specific commands
and their effect.</p>

<p>PARAMETERS private-command [private-parameters] Execute
the specified private-command on the interface. The command
may optionally take or require arguments, and may display
information. Therefore, the command line parameters may or
may not be needed and should match the command expectations.
The list of commands that iwpriv displays (when called
without argument) should give you some hints about those
parameters. However you should refer to the device driver
documentation for information on how to properly use the
command and the effect.</p>

<p>private-command [I] [private-parameters] Idem, except
that I (an integer) is passed to the command as a Token
Index. Only some command will use the Token Index (most will
ignore it), and the driver documentation should tell you
when its needed.</p>

<p>-a/--all Execute and display all the private commands
that dont take any arguments (i.e. read only).</p>

<p>DISPLAY For each device which support private commands,
iwpriv will display the list of private commands
available.</p>

<p>This include the name of the private command, the number
or arguments that may be set and their type, and the number
or arguments that may be display and their type.</p>

<p>For example, you may have the following display : eth0
Available private ioctl : setqualthr (89F0) : set 1 byte
&amp; get 0 gethisto (89F7) : set 0 &amp; get 16 int</p>

<p>This indicate that you may set the quality threshold and
display an histogram of up to 16 values with the following
commands : iwpriv eth0 setqualthr 20 iwpriv eth0
gethisto</p>
