<p>SYSTEM-AUTH-AC(5) SYSTEM-AUTH-AC(5)</p>

<p>NAME system-auth-ac, password-auth-ac,
smartcard-auth-ac, fingerprint-auth- ac - Common
configuration files for PAMified services written by auth-
config(8)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS /etc/pam.d/system-auth-ac</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The purpose of this configuration file is to
provide common configura- tion file for all applications and
service daemons calling PAM library.</p>

<p>The system-auth configuration file is included from all
individual ser- vice configuration files with the help of
the include directive. When authconfig(8) writes the system
PAM configuration file it replaces the default system-auth
file with a symlink pointing to system-auth-ac and writes
the configuration to this file. The symlink is not changed
on subsequent configuration changes even if it points
elsewhere. This allows system administrators to override the
configuration written by authconfig.</p>

<p>The authconfig now writes the authentication modules
also into addi- tional PAM configuration files
/etc/pam.d/password-auth-ac, /etc/pam.d/smartcard-auth-ac,
and /etc/pam.d/fingerprint-auth-ac. These configuration
files contain only modules which perform authenti- cation
with the respective kinds of authentication tokens. For
example /etc/pam.d/smartcard-auth[-ac] will not contain
pam_unix and pam_ldap modules and
/etc/pam.d/password-auth[-ac] will not contain pam_pkcs11
and pam_fprintd modules.</p>

<p>The PAM configuration files of services which are
accessed by remote connections such as sshd or ftpd now
include the /etc/pam.d/password- auth configuration file
instead of /etc/pam.d/system-auth.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE Configure system to use pam_tally2 for
configuration of maximum number of failed logins. Also call
pam_access to verify if access is allowed.</p>

<p>Make system-auth symlink point to system-auth-local
which contains:</p>

<p>auth requisite pam_access.so auth requisite
pam_tally2.so deny=3 lock_time=30 unlock_time=3600 auth
include system-auth-ac account required pam_tally2.so
account include system-auth-ac password include
system-auth-ac session include system-auth-ac</p>

<p>BUGS None known.</p>
