<p>DESCRIPTION scanimage is a command-line interface to
control image acquisition devices such as flatbed scanners
or cameras. The device is controlled via command-line
options. After command-line processing, scanimage normally
proceeds to acquire an image. The image data is written to
standard output in one of the PNM (portable aNyMaP) formats
(PBM for black-and-white images, PGM for grayscale images,
and PPM for color images) or in TIFF (black-and-white,
grayscale or color). scanimage accesses image acquisition
devices through the SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) interface
and can thus support any device for which there exists a
SANE backend (try apropos sane- to get a list of available
backends).</p>

<p>EXAMPLES To get a list of devices:</p>

<p>scanimage -L</p>

<p>To scan with default settings to the file image.pnm:</p>

<p>scanimage &gt;image.pnm</p>

<p>To scan 100x100 mm to the file image.tiff (-x and -y may
not be avail- able with all devices):</p>

<p>scanimage -x 100 -y 100 --format=tiff &gt;image.tiff</p>

<p>To print all available options:</p>

<p>scanimage -h</p>

<p>OPTIONS Parameters are separated by a blank from
single-character options (e.g. -d epson) and by a
&quot;=&quot; from multi-character options (e.g.
--device-name=epson).</p>

<p>The -d or --device-name options must be followed by a
SANE device-name like epson:/dev/sg0 or hp:/dev/usbscanner0.
A (partial) list of available devices can be obtained with
the --list-devices option (see below). If no device-name is
specified explicitly, scanimage reads a device-name from the
environment variable SANE_DEFAULT_DEVICE. If this variable
is not set, scanimage will attempt to open the first
available device.</p>

<p>The --format format option selects how image data is
written to stan- dard output. format can be pnm or tiff. If
--format is not used, PNM is written.</p>

<p>The -i or --icc-profile option is used to include an ICC
profile into a TIFF file.</p>

<p>The -L or --list-devices option requests a (partial)
list of devices that are available. The list is not complete
since some devices may be available, but are not listed in
any of the configuration files (which are typically stored
in directory /etc/sane.d). This is particularly the case
when accessing scanners through the network. If a device is
not listed in a configuration file, the only way to access
it is by its full device name. You may need to consult your
system administrator to find out the names of such
devices.</p>

<p>The -f or --formatted-device-list option works similar
to --list-devices, but requires a format string. scanimage
replaces the placeholders %d %v %m %t %i %n with the device
name, vendor name, model name, scanner type, an index number
and newline respectively. The com- mand</p>

<p>scanimage -f _ scanner number %i device %d is a %t,
model %m, produced by %v _</p>

<p>will produce something like:</p>

<p>scanner number 0 device sharp:/dev/sg1 is a flatbed
scanner, model JX250 SCSI, produced by SHARP</p>

<p>The --batch* options provide the features for scanning
documents using document feeders. --batch [format] is used
to specify the format of the filename that each page will be
written to. Each page is written out to a single file. If
format is not specified, the default of out%d.pnm (or
out%d.tif for --format tiff) will be used. format is given
as a printf style string with one integer parameter.
--batch-start start selects the page number to start naming
files with. If this option is not given, the counter will
start at 0. --batch-count count specifies the number of
pages to attempt to scan. If not given, scanimage will
continue scanning until the scanner returns a state other
than OK. Not all scanners with document feeders signal when
the ADF is empty, use this command to work around them. With
--batch-increment increment you can change the amount that
the number in the filename is incremented by. Generally this
is used when you are scanning double-sided documents on a
single-sided document feeder. A specific command is provided
to aid this: --batch-double will automatically set the
increment to 2. --batch-prompt will ask for pressing RETURN
before scanning a page. This can be used for scanning
multiple pages without an automatic document feeder.</p>

<p>The --accept-md5-only option only accepts user
authorization requests that support MD5 security. The SANE
network daemon (saned) is capable of doing such requests.
See saned(8).</p>

<p>The -p or --progress option requests that scanimage
prints a progress counter. It shows how much image data of
the current image has already been received by scanimage (in
percent).</p>

<p>The -n or --dont-scan option requests that scanimage
only sets the options provided by the user but doesnt
actually perform a scan. This option can be used to e.g.
turn off the scanners lamp (if supported by the
backend).</p>

<p>The -T or --test option requests that scanimage performs
a few simple sanity tests to make sure the backend works as
defined by the SANE API (in particular the sane_read
function is exercised by this test).</p>

<p>The -h or --help options request help information. The
information is printed on standard output and in this case,
no attempt will be made to acquire an image.</p>

<p>The -v or --verbose options increase the verbosity of
the operation of scanimage. The option may be specified
repeatedly, each time increas- ing the verbosity level.</p>

<p>The -B or --buffer-size changes the input buffer size
from 32KB to the number kB specified or 1M.</p>

<p>The -V or --version option requests that scanimage
prints the program and package name, the version number of
the SANE distribution that it came with and the version of
the backend that it loads. Usually thats the dll backend. If
more information about the version numbers of the backends
are necessary, the DEBUG variable for the dll backend can be
used. Example: SANE_DEBUG_DLL=3 scanimage -L.</p>

<p>As you might imagine, much of the power of scanimage
comes from the fact that it can control any SANE backend.
Thus, the exact set of com- mand-line options depends on the
capabilities of the selected device. To see the options for
a device named dev, invoke scanimage via a com- mand-line of
the form:</p>

<p>scanimage --help --device-name dev</p>

<p>The documentation for the device-specific options
printed by --help is best explained with a few examples:</p>

<p>-l 0..218mm [0] Top-left x position of scan area.</p>

<p>The description above shows that option -l expects an
option value in the range from 0 to 218 mm. The value in
square brack- ets indicates that the current option value is
0 mm. Most back- ends provide similar geometry options for
top-left y position (-t), width (-x) and height of scan-area
(-y).</p>

<p>--brightness -100..100% [0] Controls the brightness of
the acquired image.</p>

<p>The description above shows that option --brightness
expects an option value in the range from -100 to 100
percent. The value in square brackets indicates that the
current option value is 0 percent.</p>

<p>--default-enhancements Set default values for
enhancement controls.</p>

<p>The description above shows that option
--default-enhancements has no option value. It should be
thought of as having an imme- diate effect at the point of
the command-line at which it appears. For example, since
this option resets the --brightness option, the option-pair
--brightness 50 --default-enhancements would effectively be
a no-op.</p>

<p>--mode Lineart|Gray|Color [Gray] Selects the scan mode
(e.g., lineart or color).</p>

<p>The description above shows that option --mode accepts
an argu- ment that must be one of the strings Lineart, Gray,
or Color. The value in the square bracket indicates that the
option is currently set to Gray. For convenience, it is
legal to abbrevi- ate the string values as long as they
remain unique. Also, the case of the spelling doesnt matter.
For example, option set- ting --mode col is identical to
--mode Color.</p>

<p>--custom-gamma[=(yes|no)] [inactive] Determines whether
a builtin or a custom gamma-table should be used.</p>

<p>The description above shows that option --custom-gamma
expects either no option value, a &quot;yes&quot; string, or
a &quot;no&quot; string. Spec- ifying the option with no
value is equivalent to specifying &quot;yes&quot;. The value
in square-brackets indicates that the option is not
currently active. That is, attempting to set the option
would result in an error message. The set of available
options typically depends on the settings of other options.
For exam- ple, the --custom-gamma table might be active only
when a grayscale or color scan-mode has been requested.</p>

<p>Note that the --help option is processed only after all
other options have been processed. This makes it possible to
see the option settings for a particular mode by specifying
the appro- priate mode-options along with the --help option.
For example, the command-line:</p>

<p>scanimage --help --mode color</p>

<p>would print the option settings that are in effect when
the color-mode is selected.</p>

<p>--gamma-table 0..255,... Gamma-correction table. In
color mode this option equally affects the red, green, and
blue channels simultaneously (i.e., it is an intensity gamma
table).</p>

<p>The description above shows that option --gamma-table
expects zero or more values in the range 0 to 255. For
example, a legal value for this option would be
&quot;3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12&quot;. Since it s cumbersome to
specify long vectors in this form, the same can be expressed
by the abbreviated form &quot;[0]3-[9]12&quot;. What this
means is that the first vector element is set to 3, the 9-th
element is set to 12 and the values in between are interpo-
lated linearly. Of course, it is possible to specify
multiple such linear segments. For example,
&quot;[0]3-[2]3-[6]7,[7]10-[9]6&quot; is equivalent to
&quot;3,3,3,4,5,6,7,10,8,6&quot;. The program
gamma4scanimage can be used to generate such gamma tables
(see gamma4scanimage(1) for details).</p>

<p>--filename &lt;string&gt; [/tmp/input.ppm] The filename
of the image to be loaded.</p>

<p>The description above is an example of an option that
takes an arbitrary string value (which happens to be a
filename). Again, the value in brackets show that the option
is current set to the filename /tmp/input.ppm.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT SANE_DEFAULT_DEVICE The default
device-name.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/sane.d This directory holds various
configuration files. For details, please refer to the manual
pages listed below.</p>

<p>~/.sane/pass This file contains lines of the form</p>

<p>user:password:resource</p>

<p>scanimage uses this information to answer user
authorization requests automatically. The file must have
0600 permissions or stricter. You should use this file in
conjunction with the --accept-md5-only option to avoid
server-side attacks. The resource may contain any character
but is limited to 127 charac- ters.</p>
