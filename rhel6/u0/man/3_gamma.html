<p>GAMMA(3) Linux Programmer s Manual GAMMA(3)</p>

<p>NAME gamma, gammaf, gammal - (logarithm of the) gamma
function</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;math.h&gt;</p>

<p>double gamma(double x); float gammaf(float x); long
double gammal(long double x);</p>

<p>Link with -lm.</p>

<p>Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
feature_test_macros(7)):</p>

<p>gamma(): _BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE
gammaf(), gammal(): _BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE ||
_XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;= 600</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION These functions are deprecated: instead, use
either the tgamma(3) or the lgamma(3) functions, as
appropriate.</p>

<p>For the definition of the Gamma function, see
tgamma(3).</p>

<p>*BSD version The libm in 4.4BSD and some versions of
FreeBSD had a gamma() function that computes the Gamma
function, as one would expect.</p>

<p>glibc version Glibc has a gamma() function that is
equivalent to lgamma(3) and com- putes the natural logarithm
of the Gamma function.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE See lgamma(3).</p>

<p>ERRORS See lgamma(3).</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO Because of historical variations in
behavior across systems, this func- tion is not specified in
any standard.</p>

<p>NOTES History 4.2BSD had a gamma() that computed
ln(|Gamma(|x|)|), leaving the sign of Gamma(|x|) in the
external integer signgam. In 4.3BSD the name was changed to
lgamma(3), and the man page promises</p>

<p>&quot;At some time in the future the name gamma will be
rehabilitated and used for the Gamma function&quot;</p>

<p>This did indeed happen in 4.4BSD, where gamma() computes
the Gamma function (with no effect on signgam). However,
this came too late, and we now have tgamma(3), the
&quot;true gamma&quot; function.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO lgamma(3), signgam(3), tgamma(3)</p>
