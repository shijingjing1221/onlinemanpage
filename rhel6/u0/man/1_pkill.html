<p>NAME pgrep, pkill - look up or signal processes based on
name and other attributes</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pgrep [-flvx] [-d delimiter] [-n|-o] [-P
ppid,...] [-g pgrp,...] [-s sid,...] [-u euid,...] [-U
uid,...] [-G gid,...] [-t term,...] [pattern]</p>

<p>pkill [-signal] [-fvx] [-n|-o] [-P ppid,...] [-g
pgrp,...] [-s sid,...] [-u euid,...] [-U uid,...] [-G
gid,...] [-t term,...] [pattern]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pgrep looks through the currently running
processes and lists the pro- cess IDs which matches the
selection criteria to stdout. All the cri- teria have to
match. For example,</p>

<p>pgrep -u root sshd</p>

<p>will only list the processes called sshd AND owned by
root. On the other hand,</p>

<p>pgrep -u root,daemon</p>

<p>will list the processes owned by root OR daemon.</p>

<p>pkill will send the specified signal (by default
SIGTERM) to each pro- cess instead of listing them on
stdout.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -d delimiter Sets the string used to delimit
each process ID in the output (by default a newline). (pgrep
only.)</p>

<p>-f The pattern is normally only matched against the
process name. When -f is set, the full command line is
used.</p>

<p>-g pgrp,... Only match processes in the process group
IDs listed. Process group 0 is translated into pgreps or
pkill s own process group.</p>

<p>-G gid,... Only match processes whose real group ID is
listed. Either the numerical or symbolical value may be
used.</p>

<p>-l List the process name as well as the process ID.
(pgrep only.)</p>

<p>-n Select only the newest (most recently started) of the
matching processes.</p>

<p>-o Select only the oldest (least recently started) of
the matching processes.</p>

<p>-P ppid,... Only match processes whose parent process ID
is listed.</p>

<p>-s sid,... Only match processes whose process session ID
is listed. Ses- sion ID 0 is translated into pgreps or
pkills own session ID.</p>

<p>-t term,... Only match processes whose controlling
terminal is listed. The terminal name should be specified
without the &quot;/dev/&quot; prefix.</p>

<p>-u euid,... Only match processes whose effective user ID
is listed. Either the numerical or symbolical value may be
used.</p>

<p>-U uid,... Only match processes whose real user ID is
listed. Either the numerical or symbolical value may be
used.</p>

<p>-v Negates the matching.</p>

<p>-x Only match processes whose name (or command line if
-f is speci- fied) exactly match the pattern.</p>

<p>-signal Defines the signal to send to each matched
process. Either the numeric or the symbolic signal name can
be used. (pkill only.)</p>

<p>OPERANDS pattern Specifies an Extended Regular
Expression for matching against the process names or command
lines.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Example 1: Find the process ID of the named
daemon:</p>

<p>unix$ pgrep -u root named</p>

<p>Example 2: Make syslog reread its configuration
file:</p>

<p>unix$ pkill -HUP syslogd</p>

<p>Example 3: Give detailed information on all xterm
processes:</p>

<p>unix$ ps -fp $(pgrep -d, -x xterm)</p>

<p>Example 4: Make all netscape processes run nicer:</p>

<p>unix$ renice +4 pgrep netscape</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS 0 One or more processes matched the
criteria.</p>

<p>1 No processes matched.</p>

<p>2 Syntax error in the command line.</p>

<p>3 Fatal error: out of memory etc.</p>

<p>NOTES The process name used for matching is limited to
the 15 characters present in the output of /proc/pid/stat.
Use the -f option to match against the complete command
line, /proc/pid/cmdline.</p>

<p>The running pgrep or pkill process will never report
itself as a match.</p>

<p>BUGS The options -n and -o and -v can not be combined.
Let me know if you need to do this.</p>

<p>Defunct processes are reported.</p>

<p>STANDARDS pkill and pgrep were introduced in Suns
Solaris 7. This implementa- tion is fully compatible.</p>
