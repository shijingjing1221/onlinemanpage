<p>MYSQL_FIX_EXTENSI(1) MySQL Database System
MYSQL_FIX_EXTENSI(1)</p>

<p>NAME mysql_fix_extensions - normalize table file name
extensions</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS mysql_fix_extensions data_dir</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION mysql_fix_extensions converts the extensions
for MyISAM (or ISAM) table files to their canonical forms.
It looks for files with extensions matching any lettercase
variant of .frm, .myd, .myi, .isd, and .ism and renames them
to have extensions of .frm, .MYD, .MYI, .ISD, and .ISM,
respectively. This can be useful after transferring the
files from a system with case-insensitive file names (such
as Windows) to a system with case-sensitive file names.</p>

<p>Invoke mysql_fix_extensions like this, where data_dir is
the path name to the MySQL data directory.</p>

<p>shell&gt; mysql_fix_extensions data_dir</p>
