<p>NAME skb_recycle_check - check if skb can be reused for
receive</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS int skb_recycle_check(struct sk_buff * skb, int
skb_size);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS skb buffer</p>

<p>skb_size minimum receive buffer size</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Checks that the skb passed in is not shared
or cloned, and that it is linear and its head portion at
least as large as skb_size so that it can be recycled as a
receive buffer. If these conditions are met, this function
does any necessary reference count dropping and cleans up
the skbuff as if it just came from __alloc_skb.</p>
