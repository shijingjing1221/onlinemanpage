<p>NAME spottopgm - convert SPOT satellite images to a PGM
image</p>

<p>SYNTAX spottopgm [-1|-2|-3] [Firstcol Firstline Lastcol
Lastline] inputfile</p>

<p>OPTIONS -1</p>

<p>-2</p>

<p>-3 Extract the given color from the SPOT image. The
colors are infrared, visible light, and ultraviolet,
although I dont know which corresponds to which number. If
the image is in color, spottopgm announces this on Standard
Error. The default color is 1.</p>

<p>PARAMETERS Firstcol Firstline Lastcol Lastline Extract
the specified rectangle from the SPOT image. Most SPOT
images are 3000 lines long and 3000 or more columns wide.
Unfor- tunately, the SPOT format only gives the width and
not the length. The width is printed on standard error. The
default rectangle is the width of the input image by 3000
lines.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>spottopgm converts the named inputfile to PGM format,
defaulting to the first color and the whole SPOT image
unless you specify otherwise with the options.</p>

<p>LIMITATIONS spottopgm doesnt determine the length of the
input file; this would involve two passes over the input
file. It defaults to 3000 lines instead.</p>

<p>spottopgm could extract a three-color image (as a PPM),
but I didnt feel like making the program more complicated
than it is now. Besides, there is no one-to-one
correspondence between red, green, blue and infrared,
visible and ultraviolet.</p>

<p>Ive had only a limited number of SPOT images to play
with, and there- fore wouldnt guarantee that this will work
on any other images.</p>
