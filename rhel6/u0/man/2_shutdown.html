<p>SHUTDOWN(2) Linux Programmer s Manual SHUTDOWN(2)</p>

<p>NAME shutdown - shut down part of a full-duplex
connection</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;</p>

<p>int shutdown(int sockfd, int how);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The shutdown() call causes all or part of a
full-duplex connection on the socket associated with sockfd
to be shut down. If how is SHUT_RD, further receptions will
be disallowed. If how is SHUT_WR, further transmissions will
be disallowed. If how is SHUT_RDWR, further recep- tions and
transmissions will be disallowed.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, zero is returned. On error, -1
is returned, and errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS EBADF sockfd is not a valid descriptor.</p>

<p>ENOTCONN The specified socket is not connected.</p>

<p>ENOTSOCK sockfd is a file, not a socket.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO POSIX.1-2001, 4.4BSD (the shutdown()
function call first appeared in 4.2BSD).</p>

<p>NOTES The constants SHUT_RD, SHUT_WR, SHUT_RDWR have the
value 0, 1, 2, respectively, and are defined in
&lt;sys/socket.h&gt; since glibc-2.1.91.</p>
