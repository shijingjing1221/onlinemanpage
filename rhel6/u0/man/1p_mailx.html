<p>MAILX(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual MAILX(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME mailx - process messages</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS Send Mode mailx [-s subject] address...</p>

<p>Receive Mode mailx -e</p>

<p>mailx [-HiNn][-F][-u user]</p>

<p>mailx -f[-HiNn][-F][file]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The mailx utility provides a message sending
and receiving facility. It has two major modes, selected by
the options used: Send Mode and Receive Mode.</p>

<p>On systems that do not support the User Portability
Utilities option, an application using mailx shall have the
ability to send messages in an unspecified manner (Send
Mode). Unless the first character of one or more lines is
tilde (~), all characters in the input message shall appear
in the delivered message, but additional characters may be
inserted in the message before it is retrieved.</p>

<p>On systems supporting the User Portability Utilities
option, mail- receiving capabilities and other interactive
features, Receive Mode, described below, also shall be
enabled.</p>

<p>Send Mode Send Mode can be used by applications or users
to send messages from the text in standard input.</p>

<p>Receive Mode Receive Mode is more oriented towards
interactive users. Mail can be read and sent in this
interactive mode.</p>

<p>When reading mail, mailx provides commands to facilitate
saving, delet- ing, and responding to messages. When sending
mail, mailx allows edit- ing, reviewing, and other
modification of the message as it is entered.</p>

<p>Incoming mail shall be stored in one or more unspecified
locations for each user, collectively called the system
mailbox for that user. When mailx is invoked in Receive
Mode, the system mailbox shall be the default place to find
new mail. As messages are read, they shall be marked to be
moved to a secondary file for storage, unless specific
action is taken. This secondary file is called the mbox and
is normally located in the directory referred to by the HOME
environment variable (see MBOX in the ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
section for a description of this file). Messages shall
remain in this file until explicitly removed. When the -f
option is used to read mail messages from sec- ondary files,
messages shall be retained in those files unless specifi-
cally removed. All three of these locations-system mailbox,
mbox, and secondary file-are referred to in this section as
simply &quot;mailboxes&quot;, unless more specific
identification is required.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The mailx utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>The following options shall be supported. (Only the -s
subject option shall be required on all systems. The other
options are required only on systems supporting the User
Portability Utilities option.)</p>

<p>-e Test for the presence of mail in the system mailbox.
The mailx utility shall write nothing and exit with a
successful return code if there is mail to read.</p>

<p>-f Read messages from the file named by the file operand
instead of the system mailbox. (See also folder.) If no file
operand is specified, read messages from mbox instead of the
system mail- box.</p>

<p>-F Record the message in a file named after the first
recipient. The name is the login-name portion of the address
found first on the To: line in the mail header. Overrides
the record variable, if set (see Internal Variables in mailx
.)</p>

<p>-H Write a header summary only.</p>

<p>-i Ignore interrupts. (See also ignore.)</p>

<p>-n Do not initialize from the system default start-up
file. See the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section.</p>

<p>-N Do not write an initial header summary.</p>

<p>-s subject Set the Subject header field to subject. All
characters in the subject string shall appear in the
delivered message. The results are unspecified if subject is
longer than {LINE_MAX} - 10 bytes or contains a
&lt;newline&gt;.</p>

<p>-u user Read the system mailbox of the login name user.
This shall only be successful if the invoking user has the
appropriate privi- leges to read the system mailbox of that
user.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operands shall be supported:</p>

<p>address Addressee of message. When -n is specified and
no user start-up files are accessed (see the EXTENDED
DESCRIPTION section), the user or application shall ensure
this is an address to pass to the mail delivery system. Any
system or user start-up files may enable aliases (see alias
under Commands in mailx ) that may modify the form of
address before it is passed to the mail delivery system.</p>

<p>file A pathname of a file to be read instead of the
system mailbox when -f is specified. The meaning of the file
option-argument shall be affected by the contents of the
folder internal vari- able; see Internal Variables in mailx
.</p>

<p>STDIN When mailx is invoked in Send Mode (the first
synopsis line), standard input shall be the message to be
delivered to the specified addresses. When in Receive Mode,
user commands shall be accepted from stdin. If the User
Portability Utilities option is not supported, standard
input lines beginning with a tilde (~ ) character produce
unspecified results.</p>

<p>If the User Portability Utilities option is supported,
then in both Send and Receive Modes, standard input lines
beginning with the escape character (usually tilde (~))
shall affect processing as described in Command Escapes in
mailx .</p>

<p>INPUT FILES When mailx is used as described by this
volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, the file option-argument
(see the -f option) and the mbox shall be text files
containing mail messages, formatted as described in the
OUTPUT FILES section. The nature of the system mailbox is
unspecified; it need not be a file.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of mailx:</p>

<p>DEAD Determine the pathname of the file in which to save
partial mes- sages in case of interrupts or delivery errors.
The default shall be dead.letter in the directory named by
the HOME vari- able. The behavior of mailx in saving partial
messages is unspecified if the User Portability Utilities
option is not sup- ported and DEAD is not defined with the
value /dev/null.</p>

<p>EDITOR Determine the name of a utility to invoke when
the edit (see Commands in mailx ) or ~e (see Command Escapes
in mailx ) com- mand is used. The default editor is
unspecified. On XSI-con- formant systems it is ed. The
effects of this variable are unspecified if the User
Portability Utilities option is not sup- ported.</p>

<p>HOME Determine the pathname of the users home
directory.</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments
and input files) and the handling of case-insensitive
address and header-field comparisons.</p>

<p>LC_TIME Determine the format and contents of the date
and time strings written by mailx.</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error and informative messages written
to standard output.</p>

<p>LISTER Determine a string representing the command for
writing the con- tents of the folder directory to standard
output when the fold- ers command is given (see folders in
Commands in mailx ). Any string acceptable as a
command_string operand to the sh -c com- mand shall be
valid. If this variable is null or not set, the output
command shall be ls. The effects of this variable are
unspecified if the User Portability Utilities option is not
sup- ported.</p>

<p>MAILRC Determine the pathname of the start-up file. The
default shall be .mailrc in the directory referred to by the
HOME environment variable. The behavior of mailx is
unspecified if the User Portability Utilities option is not
supported and MAILRC is not defined with the value
/dev/null.</p>

<p>MBOX Determine a pathname of the file to save messages
from the sys- tem mailbox that have been read. The exit
command shall override this function, as shall saving the
message explicitly in another file. The default shall be
mbox in the directory named by the HOME variable. The
effects of this variable are unspecified if the User
Portability Utilities option is not supported.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>PAGER Determine a string representing an output
filtering or pagina- tion command for writing the output to
the terminal. Any string acceptable as a command_string
operand to the sh -c command shall be valid. When standard
output is a terminal device, the message output shall be
piped through the command if the mailx internal variable crt
is set to a value less the number of lines in the message;
see Internal Variables in mailx . If the PAGER variable is
null or not set, the paginator shall be either more or
another paginator utility documented in the system
documenta- tion. The effects of this variable are
unspecified if the User Portability Utilities option is not
supported.</p>

<p>SHELL Determine the name of a preferred command
interpreter. The default shall be sh. The effects of this
variable are unspeci- fied if the User Portability Utilities
option is not supported.</p>

<p>TERM If the internal variable screen is not specified,
determine the name of the terminal type to indicate in an
unspecified manner the number of lines in a screenful of
headers. If TERM is not set or is set to null, an
unspecified default terminal type shall be used and the
value of a screenful is unspecified. The effects of this
variable are unspecified if the User Portability Utilities
option is not supported.</p>

<p>TZ This variable may determine the timezone used to
calculate date and time strings written by mailx. If TZ is
unset or null, an unspecified default timezone shall be
used.</p>

<p>VISUAL Determine a pathname of a utility to invoke when
the visual com- mand (see Commands in mailx ) or ~v
command-escape (see Command Escapes in mailx ) is used. If
this variable is null or not set, the full-screen editor
shall be vi. The effects of this vari- able are unspecified
if the User Portability Utilities option is not
supported.</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS When mailx is in Send Mode and
standard input is not a terminal, it shall take the standard
action for all signals.</p>

<p>In Receive Mode, or in Send Mode when standard input is
a terminal, if a SIGINT signal is received:</p>

<p>1. If in command mode, the current command, if there is
one, shall be aborted, and a command-mode prompt shall be
written.</p>

<p>2. If in input mode:</p>

<p>a. If ignore is set, mailx shall write &quot;n&quot;,
discard the current input line, and continue processing,
bypassing the message- abort mechanism described in item
2b.</p>

<p>b. If the interrupt was received while sending mail,
either when in Receive Mode or in Send Mode, a message shall
be written, and another subsequent interrupt, with no other
intervening characters typed, shall be required to abort the
mail message. If in Receive Mode and another interrupt is
received, a com- mand-mode prompt shall be written. If in
Send Mode and another interrupt is received, mailx shall
terminate with a non-zero status.</p>

<p>In both cases listed in item b, if the message is not
empty:</p>

<p>i. If save is enabled and the file named by DEAD can be
created, the message shall be written to the file named by
DEAD. If the file exists, the message shall be written to
replace the contents of the file.</p>

<p>ii. If save is not enabled, or the file named by DEAD
can- not be created, the message shall not be saved.</p>

<p>The mailx utility shall take the standard action for all
other signals.</p>

<p>STDOUT In command and input modes, all output, including
prompts and messages, shall be written to standard
output.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES Various mailx commands and command escapes
can create or add to files, including the mbox, the
dead-letter file, and secondary mailboxes. When mailx is
used as described in this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,
these files shall be text files, formatted as follows: line
beginning with From&lt;space&gt; [one or more header-lines;
see Commands in mailx ] empty line [zero or more body lines
empty line] [line beginning with From&lt;space&gt;...]</p>

<p>where each message begins with the From &lt;space&gt;
line shown, preceded by the beginning of the file or an
empty line. (The From &lt;space&gt; line is considered to be
part of the message header, but not one of the header- lines
referred to in Commands in mailx ; thus, it shall not be
affected by the discard, ignore, or retain commands.) The
formats of the remain- der of the From &lt;space&gt; line
and any additional header lines are unspecified, except that
none shall be empty. The format of a message body line is
also unspecified, except that no line following an empty
line shall start with From &lt;space&gt;; mailx shall modify
any such user- entered message body lines (following an
empty line and beginning with From &lt;space&gt;) by adding
one or more characters to precede theF; it may add these
characters to From &lt;space&gt; lines that are not preceded
by an empty line.</p>

<p>When a message from the system mailbox or entered by the
user is not a text file, it is implementation-defined how
such a message is stored in files written by mailx.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION The entire EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
section shall apply only to implementa- tions supporting the
User Portability Utilities option.</p>

<p>The mailx utility cannot guarantee support for all
character encodings in all circumstances. For example,
inter-system mail may be restricted to 7-bit data by the
underlying network, 8-bit data need not be portable to
non-internationalized systems, and so on. Under these cir-
cumstances, it is recommended that only characters defined
in the ISO/IEC 646:1991 standard International Reference
Version (equivalent to ASCII) 7-bit range of characters be
used.</p>

<p>When mailx is invoked using one of the Receive Mode
synopsis forms, it shall write a page of header-summary
lines (if -N was not specified and there are messages, see
below), followed by a prompt indicating that mailx can
accept regular commands (see Commands in mailx ); this is
termed command mode. The page of header-summary lines shall
contain the first new message if there are new messages, or
the first unread mes- sage if there are unread messages, or
the first message. When mailx is invoked using the Send Mode
synopsis and standard input is a terminal, if no subject is
specified on the command line and the asksub variable is
set, a prompt for the subject shall be written. At this
point, mailx shall be in input mode. This input mode shall
also be entered when using one of the Receive Mode synopsis
forms and a reply or new message is composed using the
reply, Reply, followup, Followup, or mail com- mands and
standard input is a terminal. When the message is typed and
the end of the message is encountered, the message shall be
passed to the mail delivery software. Commands can be
entered by beginning a line with the escape character (by
default, tilde ( ~ )) followed by a single command letter
and optional arguments. See Commands in mailx for a summary
of these commands. It is unspecified what effect these
commands will have if standard input is not a terminal when
a message is entered using either the Send Mode synopsis, or
the Read Mode com- mands reply, Reply, followup, Followup,
or mail.</p>

<p>Note: For notational convenience, this section uses the
default escape character, tilde, in all references and
examples.</p>

<p>At any time, the behavior of mailx shall be governed by
a set of envi- ronmental and internal variables. These are
flags and valued parameters that can be set and cleared via
the mailx set and unset commands.</p>

<p>Regular commands are of the form:</p>

<p>[command] [msglist] [argument ...]</p>

<p>If no command is specified in command mode, next shall
be assumed. In input mode, commands shall be recognized by
the escape character, and lines not treated as commands
shall be taken as input for the message.</p>

<p>In command mode, each message shall be assigned a
sequential number, starting with 1.</p>

<p>All messages have a state that shall affect how they are
displayed in the header summary and how they are retained or
deleted upon termina- tion of mailx. There is at any time
the notion of a current message, which shall be marked by
a&gt;at the beginning of a line in the header summary. When
mailx is invoked using one of the Receive Mode synopsis
forms, the current message shall be the first new message,
if there is a new message, or the first unread message if
there is an unread mes- sage, or the first message if there
are any messages, or unspecified if there are no messages in
the mailbox. Each command that takes an optional list of
messages (msglist) or an optional single message (mes- sage)
on which to operate shall leave the current message set to
the highest-numbered message of the messages specified,
unless the command deletes messages, in which case the
current message shall be set to the first undeleted message
(that is, a message not in the deleted state) after the
highest-numbered message deleted by the command, if one
exists, or the first undeleted message before the
highest-numbered mes- sage deleted by the command, if one
exists, or to an unspecified value if there are no remaining
undeleted messages. All messages shall be in one of the
following states:</p>

<p>new The message is present in the system mailbox and has
not been viewed by the user or moved to any other state.
Messages in state new when mailx quits shall be retained in
the system mail- box.</p>

<p>unread The message has been present in the system
mailbox for more than one invocation of mailx and has not
been viewed by the user or moved to any other state.
Messages in state unread when mailx quits shall be retained
in the system mailbox.</p>

<p>read The message has been processed by one of the
following commands: ~f, ~m, ~F, ~M, copy, mbox, next, pipe,
print, Print, top, type, Type, undelete. The delete, dp, and
dt commands may also cause the next message to be marked as
read, depending on the value of the autoprint variable.
Messages that are in the system mailbox and in state read
when mailx quits shall be saved in the mbox, unless the
internal variable hold was set. Messages that are in the
mbox or in a secondary mailbox and in state read when mailx
quits shall be retained in their current location.</p>

<p>deleted The message has been processed by one of the
following commands: delete, dp, dt. Messages in state
deleted when mailx quits shall be deleted. Deleted messages
shall be ignored until mailx quits or changes mailboxes or
they are specified to the undelete com- mand; for example,
the message specification / string shall only search the
subject lines of messages that have not yet been deleted,
unless the command operating on the list of messages is
undelete. No deleted message or deleted message header shall
be displayed by any mailx command other than undelete.</p>

<p>preserved The message has been processed by a preserve
command. When mailx quits, the message shall be retained in
its current location.</p>

<p>saved The message has been processed by one of the
following commands: save or write. If the current mailbox is
the system mailbox, and the internal variable keepsave is
set, messages in the state saved shall be saved to the file
designated by the MBOX variable (see the ENVIRONMENT
VARIABLES section). If the current mailbox is the system
mailbox, messages in the state saved shall be deleted from
the current mailbox, when the quit or file command is used
to exit the current mailbox.</p>

<p>The header-summary line for each message shall indicate
the state of the message.</p>

<p>Many commands take an optional list of messages (
msglist) on which to operate, which defaults to the current
message. A msglist is a list of message specifications
separated by &lt;blank&gt;s, which can include:</p>

<p>n Message number n.</p>

<p>+ The next undeleted message, or the next deleted
message for the undelete command.</p>

<p>- The next previous undeleted message, or the next
previous deleted message for the undelete command.</p>

<p>. The current message.</p>

<p>^ The first undeleted message, or the first deleted
message for the undelete command.</p>

<p>$ The last message.</p>

<p>* All messages.</p>

<p>n-m An inclusive range of message numbers.</p>

<p>address All messages from address; any address as shown
in a header sum- mary shall be matchable in this form.</p>

<p>/string All messages with string in the subject line
(case ignored).</p>

<p>:c All messages of type c, where c shall be one of:</p>

<p>d Deleted messages.</p>

<p>n New messages.</p>

<p>o Old messages (any not in state read or new).</p>

<p>r Read messages.</p>

<p>u Unread messages.</p>

<p>Other commands take an optional message ( message) on
which to operate, which defaults to the current message. All
of the forms allowed for msglist are also allowed for
message, but if more than one message is specified, only the
first shall be operated on.</p>

<p>Other arguments are usually arbitrary strings whose
usage depends on the command involved.</p>

<p>Start-Up in mailx At start-up time, mailx shall take the
following steps in sequence:</p>

<p>1. Establish all variables at their stated default
values.</p>

<p>2. Process command line options, overriding
corresponding default val- ues.</p>

<p>3. Import any of the DEAD, EDITOR, MBOX, LISTER , PAGER,
SHELL, or VISUAL variables that are present in the
environment, overriding the corresponding default
values.</p>

<p>4. Read mailx commands from an unspecified system
start-up file, unless the -n option is given, to initialize
any internal mailx variables and aliases.</p>

<p>5. Process the start-up file of mailx commands named in
the user MAILRC variable.</p>

<p>Most regular mailx commands are valid inside start-up
files, the most common use being to set up initial display
options and alias lists. The following commands shall be
invalid in the start-up file: !, edit, hold, mail, preserve,
reply, Reply, shell, visual, Copy, followup, and Followup.
Any errors in the start-up file shall either cause mailx to
terminate with a diagnostic message and a non-zero status or
to con- tinue after writing a diagnostic message, ignoring
the remainder of the lines in the start-up file.</p>

<p>A blank line in a start-up file shall be ignored.</p>

<p>Internal Variables in mailx The following variables are
internal mailx variables. Each internal variable can be set
via the mailx set command at any time. The unset and set no
name commands can be used to erase variables.</p>

<p>In the following list, variables shown as:</p>

<p>variable</p>

<p>represent Boolean values. Variables shown as:</p>

<p>variable=value</p>

<p>shall be assigned string or numeric values. For string
values, the rules in Commands in mailx concerning filenames
and quoting shall also apply.</p>

<p>The defaults specified here may be changed by the
implementation- defined system start-up file unless the user
specifies the -n option.</p>

<p>allnet All network names whose login name components
match shall be treated as identical. This shall cause the
msglist message spec- ifications to behave similarly. The
default shall be noallnet. See also the alternates command
and the metoo variable.</p>

<p>append Append messages to the end of the mbox file upon
termination instead of placing them at the beginning. The
default shall be noappend. This variable shall not affect
the save command when saving to mbox.</p>

<p>ask, asksub Prompt for a subject line on outgoing mail
if one is not speci- fied on the command line with the -s
option. The ask and asksub forms are synonyms; the system
shall refer to asksub and noasksub in its messages, but
shall accept ask and noask as user input to mean asksub and
noasksub. It shall not be possible to set both ask and
noasksub, or noask and asksub. The default shall be asksub,
but no prompting shall be done if standard input is not a
terminal.</p>

<p>askbcc Prompt for the blind copy list. The default shall
be noaskbcc.</p>

<p>askcc Prompt for the copy list. The default shall be
noaskcc.</p>

<p>autoprint Enable automatic writing of messages after
delete and undelete commands. The default shall be
noautoprint.</p>

<p>bang Enable the special-case treatment of exclamation
marks (! ) in escape command lines; see the escape command
and Command Escapes in mailx . The default shall be nobang,
disabling the expansion of ! in the command argument to the
~! command and the ~&lt;! command escape.</p>

<p>cmd=command</p>

<p>Set the default command to be invoked by the pipe
command. The default shall be nocmd.</p>

<p>crt=number Pipe messages having more than number lines
through the command specified by the value of the PAGER
variable. The default shall be nocrt. If it is set to null,
the value used is implementa- tion-defined.</p>

<p>debug Enable verbose diagnostics for debugging. Messages
are not delivered. The default shall be nodebug.</p>

<p>dot When dot is set, a period on a line by itself during
message input from a terminal shall also signify end-of-file
(in addi- tion to normal end-of-file). The default shall be
nodot. If ignoreeof is set (see below), a setting of nodot
shall be ignored and the period is the only method to
terminate input mode.</p>

<p>escape=c Set the command escape character to be the
characterc. By default, the command escape character shall
be tilde. If escape is unset, tilde shall be used; if it is
set to null, command escaping shall be disabled.</p>

<p>flipr Reverse the meanings of the R and r commands. The
default shall be noflipr.</p>

<p>folder=directory</p>

<p>The default directory for saving mail files.
User-specified filenames beginning with a plus sign (+)
shall be expanded by preceding the filename with this
directory name to obtain the real pathname. If directory
does not start with a slash (/), the contents of HOME shall
be prefixed to it. The default shall be nofolder. If folder
is unset or set to null, user-specified filenames beginning
with+shall refer to files in the current directory that
begin with the literal+ character. See also outfolder below.
The folder value need not affect the process- ing of the
files named in MBOX and DEAD.</p>

<p>header Enable writing of the header summary when
entering mailx in Receive Mode. The default shall be
header.</p>

<p>hold Preserve all messages that are read in the system
mailbox instead of putting them in the mbox save file. The
default shall be nohold.</p>

<p>ignore Ignore interrupts while entering messages. The
default shall be noignore.</p>

<p>ignoreeof Ignore normal end-of-file during message
input. Input can be terminated only by entering a period (.)
on a line by itself or by the ~. command escape. The default
shall be noignoreeof. See also dot above.</p>

<p>indentprefix=string</p>

<p>A string that shall be added as a prefix to each line
that is inserted into the message by the ~m command escape.
This vari- able shall default to one &lt;tab&gt;.</p>

<p>keep When a system mailbox, secondary mailbox, or mbox
is empty, truncate it to zero length instead of removing it.
The default shall be nokeep.</p>

<p>keepsave Keep the messages that have been saved from the
system mailbox into other files in the file designated by
the variable MBOX , instead of deleting them. The default
shall be nokeepsave.</p>

<p>metoo Suppress the deletion of the login name of the
user from the recipient list when replying to a message or
sending to a group. The default shall be nometoo.</p>

<p>onehop When responding to a message that was originally
sent to several recipients, the other recipient addresses
are normally forced to be relative to the originating author
s machine for the response. This flag disables alteration of
the recipients addresses, improving efficiency in a network
where all machines can send directly to all other machines
(that is, one hop away). The default shall be noonehop.</p>

<p>outfolder Cause the files used to record outgoing
messages to be located in the directory specified by the
folder variable unless the pathname is absolute. The default
shall be nooutfolder. See the record variable.</p>

<p>page Insert a &lt;form-feed&gt; after each message sent
through the pipe created by the pipe command. The default
shall be nopage.</p>

<p>prompt=string</p>

<p>Set the command-mode prompt to string. If string is null
or if noprompt is set, no prompting shall occur. The default
shall be to prompt with the string &quot;? &quot; .</p>

<p>quiet Refrain from writing the opening message and
version when enter- ing mailx. The default shall be
noquiet.</p>

<p>record=file Record all outgoing mail in the file with
the pathname file. The default shall be norecord. See also
outfolder above.</p>

<p>save Enable saving of messages in the dead-letter file
on interrupt or delivery error. See the variable DEAD for
the location of the dead-letter file. The default shall be
save.</p>

<p>screen=number</p>

<p>Set the number of lines in a screenful of headers for
the head- ers and z commands. If screen is not specified, a
value based on the terminal type identified by the TERM
environment variable, the window size, the baud rate, or
some combination of these shall be used.</p>

<p>sendwait Wait for the background mailer to finish before
returning. The default shall be nosendwait.</p>

<p>showto When the sender of the message was the user who
is invoking mailx, write the information from the To: line
instead of the From: line in the header summary. The default
shall be noshowto.</p>

<p>sign=string Set the variable inserted into the text of a
message when the ~a command escape is given. The default
shall be nosign. The char- acter sequencetannshall be
recognized in the vari- able as &lt;tab&gt;s and
&lt;newline&gt;s, respectively. (See also ~i in Command
Escapes in mailx .)</p>

<p>Sign=string Set the variable inserted into the text of a
message when the ~A command escape is given. The default
shall be noSign. The char- acter sequencetannshall be
recognized in the vari- able as &lt;tab&gt;s and
&lt;newline&gt;s, respectively.</p>

<p>toplines=number</p>

<p>Set the number of lines of the message to write with the
top command. The default shall be 5.</p>

<p>Commands in mailx The following mailx commands shall be
provided. In the following list, header refers to lines from
the message header, as shown in the OUTPUT FILES section.
Header-line refers to lines within the header that begin
with one or more non-white-space characters, immediately
followed by a colon and white space and continuing until the
next line beginning with a non-white-space character or an
empty line. Header-field refers to the portion of a header
line prior to the first colon in that line.</p>

<p>For each of the commands listed below, the command can
be entered as the abbreviation (those characters in the
Synopsis command word preced- ing the [), the full command
(all characters shown for the command word, omitting the
[and]), or any truncation of the full command down to the
abbreviation. For example, the exit command (shown as ex[it]
in the Synopsis) can be entered as ex, exi, or exit.</p>

<p>The arguments to commands can be quoted, using the
following methods:</p>

<p>* An argument can be enclosed between paired
double-quotes ( &quot;&quot; ) or single-quotes ( ); any
white space, shell word expansion, or backslash characters
within the quotes shall be treated literally as part of the
argument. A double-quote shall be treated literally within
single-quotes and vice versa. These special properties of
the quote marks shall occur only when they are paired at the
begin- ning and end of the argument.</p>

<p>* A backslash outside of the enclosing quotes shall be
discarded and the following character treated literally as
part of the argument.</p>

<p>* An unquoted backslash at the end of a command line
shall be dis- carded and the next line shall continue the
command.</p>

<p>Filenames, where expected, shall be subjected to the
following trans- formations, in sequence:</p>

<p>* If the filename begins with an unquoted plus sign, and
the folder variable is defined (see the folder variable),
the plus sign shall be replaced by the value of the folder
variable followed by a slash. If the folder variable is
unset or is set to null, the filename shall be
unchanged.</p>

<p>* Shell word expansions shall be applied to the filename
(see Word Expansions ). If more than a single pathname
results from this expansion and the command is expecting one
file, the effects are unspecified.</p>

<p>Declare Aliases Synopsis:</p>

<p>a[lias] [alias [address...]]g[roup] [alias
[address...]]</p>

<p>Add the given addresses to the alias specified by alias.
The names shall be substituted when alias is used as a
recipient address speci- fied by the user in an outgoing
message (that is, other recipients addressed indirectly
through the reply command shall not be substituted in this
manner). Mail address alias substitution shall apply only
when the alias string is used as a full address; for
example, when hlj is an alias, hlj@posix.com does not
trigger the alias substitution. If no arguments are given,
write a listing of the current aliases to standard output.
If only an alias argument is given, write a listing of the
specified alias to standard output. These listings need not
reflect the same order of addresses that were entered.</p>

<p>Declare Alternatives Synopsis:</p>

<p>alt[ernates] name...</p>

<p>(See also the metoo command.) Declare a list of
alternative names for the users login. When responding to a
message, these names shall be removed from the list of
recipients for the response. The comparison of names shall
be in a case-insensitive manner. With no arguments,
alternates shall write the current list of alternative
names.</p>

<p>Change Current Directory Synopsis:</p>

<p>cd [directory]ch[dir] [directory]</p>

<p>Change directory. If directory is not specified, the
contents of HOME shall be used.</p>

<p>Copy Messages Synopsis:</p>

<p>c[opy] [file]c[opy] [msglist] fileC[opy] [msglist]</p>

<p>Copy messages to the file named by the pathname file
without marking the messages as saved. Otherwise, it shall
be equivalent to the save command.</p>

<p>In the capitalized form, save the specified messages in
a file whose name is derived from the author of the message
to be saved, without marking the messages as saved.
Otherwise, it shall be equivalent to the Save command.</p>

<p>Delete Messages Synopsis:</p>

<p>d[elete] [msglist]</p>

<p>Mark messages for deletion from the mailbox. The
deletions shall not occur until mailx quits (see the quit
command) or changes mailboxes (see the folder command). If
autoprint is set and there are messages remaining after the
delete command, the current message shall be writ- ten as
described for the print command (see the print command);
other- wise, the mailx prompt shall be written.</p>

<p>Discard Header Fields Synopsis:</p>

<p>di[scard] [header-field...]ig[nore]
[header-field...]</p>

<p>Suppress the specified header fields when writing
messages. Specified header-fields shall be added to the list
of suppressed header fields. Examples of header fields to
ignore are status and cc. The fields shall be included when
the message is saved. The Print and Type commands shall
override this command. The comparison of header fields shall
be in a case-insensitive manner. If no arguments are
specified, write a list of the currently suppressed header
fields to standard output; the listing need not reflect the
same order of header fields that were entered.</p>

<p>If both retain and discard commands are given, discard
commands shall be ignored.</p>

<p>Delete Messages and Display Synopsis:</p>

<p>dp [msglist]dt [msglist]</p>

<p>Delete the specified messages as described for the
delete command, except that the autoprint variable shall
have no effect, and the cur- rent message shall be written
only if it was set to a message after the last message
deleted by the command. Otherwise, an informational mes-
sage to the effect that there are no further messages in the
mailbox shall be written, followed by the mailx prompt.</p>

<p>The default file shall be the current mailbox.</p>

<p>Display List of Folders Synopsis:</p>

<p>folders</p>

<p>Write the names of the files in the directory set by the
folder vari- able. The command specified by the LISTER
environment variable shall be used (see the ENVIRONMENT

<p>fo[llowup] [message]F[ollowup] [msglist]</p>

<p>In the lowercase form, respond to a message, recording
the response in a file whose name is derived from the author
of the message. See also the save and copy commands and
outfolder.</p>

<p>In the capitalized form, respond to the first message in
the msglist, sending the message to the author of each
message in the msglist. The subject line shall be taken from
the first message and the response shall be recorded in a
file whose name is derived from the author of the first
message. See also the Save and Copy commands and
outfolder.</p>

<p>Both forms shall override the record variable, if
set.</p>

<p>n[ext] [message]</p>

<p>If the current message has not been written (for
example, by the print command) since mailx started or since
any other message was the current message, behave as if the
print command was entered. Otherwise, if there is an
undeleted message after the current message, make it the
current message and behave as if the print command was
entered. Other- wise, an informational message to the effect
that there are no further messages in the mailbox shall be
written, followed by the mailx prompt.</p>

the command interpreter specified by SHELL with two
arguments: -c and command. (See also sh -c.) The application
shall ensure that the command is given as a single argument.
Quoting, described previously, can be used to accom- plish
this. If no arguments are given, the current message shall
be piped through the command specified by the value of the
cmd variable. If the page variable is set, a
&lt;form-feed&gt; shall be inserted after each message.</p>

<p>Display Message with Headers Synopsis:</p>

<p>P[rint] [msglist]T[ype] [msglist]</p>

<p>Write the specified messages, including all header
lines, to standard output. Override suppression of lines by

the PAGER environment variable.</p>

<p>Display Message Synopsis:</p>

<p>p[rint] [msglist]t[ype] [msglist]</p>

<p>Write the specified messages to standard output. If crt

<p>Terminate mailx, storing messages that were read in mbox
(if the cur- rent mailbox is the system mailbox and unless
hold is set), deleting messages that have been explicitly
saved (unless keepsave is set), dis- carding messages that
have been deleted, and saving all remaining mes- sages in
the mailbox.</p>

<p>Reply to a Message List Synopsis:</p>

<p>R[eply] [msglist]R[espond] [msglist]</p>

<p>Mail a reply message to the sender of each message in
the msglist. The subject line shall be formed by
concatenating Re: &lt;space&gt; (unless it already begins

at the end of that file.</p>

<p>See also the flipr variable.</p>

<p>Reply to a Message Synopsis:</p>

<p>r[eply] [message]r[espond] [message]</p>

<p>Mail a reply message to all recipients included in the
header of the message. The subject line shall be formed by

<p>See also the flipr variable.</p>

<p>Retain Header Fields Synopsis:</p>

<p>ret[ain] [header-field...]</p>

<p>Retain the specified header fields when writing
messages. This command shall override all discard and ignore
commands. The comparison of header fields shall be in a
case-insensitive manner. If no arguments are specified,
write a list of the currently retained header fields to
standard output; the listing need not reflect the same order
of header fields that were entered.</p>

<p>Save Messages Synopsis:</p>

<p>s[ave] [file]s[ave] [msglist] fileS[ave] [msglist]</p>

<p>Save the specified messages in the file named by the
pathname file, or the mbox if the file argument is omitted.
The file shall be created if it does not exist; otherwise,
the messages shall be appended to the file. The message
shall be put in the state saved, and shall behave as
specified in the description of the saved state when the
current mail- box is exited by the quit or file command.</p>

<p>In the capitalized form, save the specified messages in
a file whose name is derived from the author of the first
message. The name of the file shall be taken to be the
authors name with all network addressing stripped off. See
also the Copy, followup, and Followup commands and outfolder
variable.</p>

<p>Set Variables Synopsis:</p>

<p>se[t] [name[=[string]] ...] [name=number ...] [noname
...]</p>

<p>Define one or more variables called name. The variable
can be given a null, string, or numeric value. Quoting and
backslash escapes can occur anywhere in string, as described
previously, as if the string portion of the argument were
the entire argument. The forms name and name= shall be
equivalent to name=&quot;&quot; for variables that take
string values. The set command without arguments shall write
a list of all defined variables and their values. The no
name form shall be equivalent to unset name.</p>

<p>Invoke a Shell Synopsis:</p>

the number of lines to write. The default shall be 5.</p>

<p>Touch Messages Synopsis:</p>

<p>tou[ch] [msglist]</p>

<p>Touch the specified messages. If any message in msglist
is not specifi- cally deleted nor saved in a file, it shall
be placed in the mbox upon normal termination. See exit and
quit.</p>

<p>Delete Aliases Synopsis:</p>

<p>una[lias] [alias]...</p>

<p>Scroll the header display forward (if+is specified or if
no option is specified) or backward (if-is specified) one
screenful. The num- ber of headers written shall be set by
the screen variable.</p>

<p>Invoke Shell Command Synopsis:</p>

<p>!command</p>

<p>Invoke the command interpreter specified by SHELL with
two arguments: -c and command. (See also sh -c.) If the bang
variable is set, each unescaped occurrence of!in command
shall be replaced with the com- mand executed by the
previous ! command or ~! command escape.</p>

<p>Null Command Synopsis:</p>

<p># comment</p>

<p>This null command (comment) shall be ignored by
mailx.</p>

<p>Display Current Message Number Synopsis:</p>

<p>=</p>

<p>Write the current message number.</p>

<p>Command Escapes in mailx The following commands can be
entered only from input mode, by begin- ning a line with the
escape character (by default, tilde (~ )). See the escape
variable description for changing this special character.
The format for the commands shall be:</p>


<p>&lt;escape-character&gt;&lt;command-char&gt;&lt;separator&gt;[&lt;arguments&gt;]</p>

<p>where the &lt;separator&gt; can be zero or more
&lt;blank&gt;s.</p>

<p>In the following descriptions, the application shall
ensure that the argument command (but not mailx-command) is
a shell command string. Any string acceptable to the command
interpreter specified by the SHELL variable when it is
invoked as SHELL -c command_string shall be valid. The
command can be presented as multiple arguments (that is,
quoting is not required).</p>

<p>Command escapes that are listed with msglist or
mailx-command arguments are invalid in Send Mode and produce
unspecified results.</p>

<p>~! command Invoke the command interpreter specified by
SHELL with two argu- ments: -c and command; and then return
to input mode. If the bang variable is set, each unescaped
occurrence of! in com- mand shall be replaced with the
command executed by the previous ! command or ~! command
escape.</p>

<p>~. Simulate end-of-file (terminate message input).</p>

<p>~: mailx-command, ~_ mailx-command</p>

<p>Perform the command-level request.</p>

<p>~? Write a summary of command escapes.</p>

<p>~A This shall be equivalent to ~i Sign.</p>

<p>~a This shall be equivalent to ~i sign.</p>

<p>~b name... Add the names to the blind carbon copy ( Bcc)
list.</p>

<p>~c name... Add the names to the carbon copy ( Cc)
list.</p>

<p>~d Read in the dead-letter file. See DEAD for a
description of this file.</p>

<p>~e Invoke the editor, as specified by the EDITOR
environment vari- able, on the partial message.</p>

<p>~f [msglist] Forward the specified messages. The
specified messages shall be inserted into the current
message without alteration. This com- mand escape also shall
insert message headers into the message with field selection
affected by the discard, ignore, and retain commands.</p>

<p>~F [msglist] This shall be the equivalent of the ~f
command escape, except that all headers shall be included in
the message, regardless of previous discard, ignore, and
retain commands.</p>

<p>~h If standard input is a terminal, prompt for a Subject
line and the To, Cc, and Bcc lists. Other
implementation-defined headers may also be presented for
editing. If the field is written with an initial value, it
can be edited as if it had just been typed.</p>

<p>~i string Insert the value of the named variable,
followed by a &lt;newline&gt;, into the text of the message.
If the string is unset or null, the message shall not be
changed.</p>

<p>~m [msglist] Insert the specified messages into the
message, prefixing non- empty lines with the string in the
indentprefix variable. This command escape also shall insert
message headers into the mes- sage, with field selection
affected by the discard, ignore, and retain commands.</p>

<p>~M [msglist] This shall be the equivalent of the ~m
command escape, except that all headers shall be included in
the message, regardless of previous discard, ignore, and
retain commands.</p>

<p>~p Write the message being entered. If the message is
longer than crt lines (see Internal Variables in mailx ),
the output shall be paginated as described for the PAGER
variable.</p>

<p>~q Quit (see the quit command) from input mode by
simulating an interrupt. If the body of the message is not
empty, the partial message shall be saved in the dead-letter
file. See DEAD for a description of this file.</p>

<p>~r file, ~&lt; file, ~r !command, ~&lt; !command</p>

<p>Read in the file specified by the pathname file. If the
argument begins with an exclamation mark (!), the rest of
the string shall be taken as an arbitrary system command;
the command interpreter specified by SHELL shall be invoked
with two argu- ments: -c and command. The standard output of
command shall be inserted into the message.</p>

<p>~s string Set the subject line to string.</p>

<p>~t name... Add the given names to the To list.</p>

<p>~v Invoke the full-screen editor, as specified by the
VISUAL envi- ronment variable, on the partial message.</p>

<p>~w file Write the partial message, without the header,
onto the file named by the pathname file. The file shall be
created or the message shall be appended to it if the file
exists.</p>

<p>~x Exit as with ~q, except the message shall not be
saved in the dead-letter file.</p>

<p>~| command Pipe the body of the message through the
given command by invok- ing the command interpreter
specified by SHELL with two argu- ments: -c and command. If
the command returns a successful exit status, the standard
output of the command shall replace the message. Otherwise,
the message shall remain unchanged. If the command fails, an
error message giving the exit status shall be written.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS When the -e option is specified, the
following exit values are returned:</p>

<p>0 Mail was found.</p>

<p>&gt;0 Mail was not found or an error occurred.</p>

<p>Otherwise, the following exit values are returned:</p>

<p>0 Successful completion; note that this status implies
that all messages were sent, but it gives no assurances that
any of them were actually delivered.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS When in input mode (Receive Mode)
or Send Mode:</p>

<p>* If an error is encountered processing a command escape
(see Command Escapes in mailx ), a diagnostic message shall
be written to stan- dard error, and the message being
composed may be modified, but this condition shall not
prevent the message from being sent.</p>

<p>* Other errors shall prevent the sending of the
message.</p>

<p>When in command mode:</p>

<p>* Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE Delivery of messages to remote systems
requires the existence of commu- nication paths to such
systems. These need not exist.</p>

<p>Input lines are limited to {LINE_MAX} bytes, but mailers
between sys- tems may impose more severe line-length
restrictions. This volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 does not
place any restrictions on the length of messages handled by
mailx, and for delivery of local messages the only
limitations should be the normal problems of available disk
space for the target mail file. When sending messages to
external machines, applications are advised to limit
messages to less than 100000 bytes because some mail
gateways impose message-length restrictions.</p>

<p>The format of the system mailbox is intentionally
unspecified. Not all systems implement system mailboxes as
flat files, particularly with the advent of multimedia mail
messages. Some system mailboxes may be multi- ple files,
others records in a database. The internal format of the
messages themselves is specified with the historical format
from Ver- sion 7, but only after the messages have been
saved in some file other than the system mailbox. This was
done so that many historical applica- tions expecting
text-file mailboxes are not broken.</p>

<p>Some new formats for messages can be expected in the
future, probably including binary data, bit maps, and
various multimedia objects. As described here, mailx is not
prohibited from handling such messages, but it must store
them as text files in secondary mailboxes (unless some
extension, such as a variable or command line option, is
used to change the stored format). Its method of doing so is
implementation- defined and might include translating the
data into text file-compati- ble or readable form or
omitting certain portions of the message from the stored
output.</p>

<p>The discard and ignore commands are not inverses of the
retain command. The retain command discards all
header-fields except those explicitly retained. The discard
command keeps all header-fields except those explicitly
discarded. If headers exist on the retained header list,
discard and ignore commands are ignored.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The standard developers felt strongly that a
method for applications to send messages to specific users
was necessary. The obvious example is a batch utility,
running non-interactively, that wishes to communicate errors
or results to a user. However, the actual format, delivery
mech- anism, and method of reading the message are clearly
beyond the scope of this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001.</p>

<p>The intent of this command is to provide a simple,
portable interface for sending messages non-interactively.
It merely defines a &quot;front-end&quot; to the historical
mail system. It is suggested that implementations explicitly
denote the sender and recipient in the body of the delivered
message. Further specification of formats for either the
message enve- lope or the message itself were deliberately
not made, as the industry is in the midst of changing from
the current standards to a more inter- nationalized standard
and it is probably incorrect, at this time, to require
either one.</p>

<p>Implementations are encouraged to conform to the various
delivery mech- anisms described in the CCITT X.400 standards
or to the equivalent Internet standards, described in
Internet Request for Comment (RFC) documents RFC 819, RFC
822, RFC 920, RFC 921, and RFC 1123.</p>

<p>Many historical systems modified each body line that
started with From by prefixing theFwith&gt;. It is
unnecessary, but allowed, to do that when the string does
not follow a blank line because it cannot be confused with
the next header.</p>

<p>The edit and visual commands merely edit the specified
messages in a temporary file. They do not modify the
contents of those messages in the mailbox; such a capability
could be added as an extension, such as by using different
command names.</p>

<p>The restriction on a subject line being {LINE_MAX}-10
bytes is based on the historical format that consumes 10
bytes for Subject: and the trailing &lt;newline&gt;. Many
historical mailers that a message may encounter on other
systems are not able to handle lines that long, how-
ever.</p>

<p>Like the utilities logger and lp, mailx admittedly is
difficult to test. This was not deemed sufficient
justification to exclude this utility from this volume of
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001. It is also arguable that it is, in
fact, testable, but that the tests themselves are not
portable.</p>

<p>When mailx is being used by an application that wishes
to receive the results as if none of the User Portability
Utilities option features were supported, the DEAD
environment variable must be set to /dev/null. Otherwise, it
may be subject to the file creations described in mailx
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS. Similarly, if the MAILRC environment
variable is not set to /dev/null, historical versions of
mailx and Mail read ini- tialization commands from a file
before processing begins. Since the initialization that a
user specifies could alter the contents of mes- sages an
application is trying to send, such applications must set
MAILRC to /dev/null.</p>

<p>The description of LC_TIME uses &quot;may affect&quot;
because many historical implementations do not or cannot
manipulate the date and time strings in the incoming mail
headers. Some headers found in incoming mail do not have
enough information to determine the timezone in which the
mail originated, and, therefore, mailx cannot convert the
date and time strings into the internal form that then is
parsed by routines like strftime() that can take LC_TIME
settings into account. Changing all these times to a
user-specified format is allowed, but not required.</p>

<p>The paginator selected when PAGER is null or unset is
partially unspec- ified to allow the System V historical
practice of using pg as the default. Bypassing the
pagination function, such as by declaring that cat is the
paginator, would not meet with the intended meaning of this
description. However, any &quot;portable user&quot; would
have to set PAGER explicitly to get his or her preferred
paginator on all systems. The paginator choice was made
partially unspecified, unlike the VISUAL edi- tor choice
(mandated to be vi) because most historical pagers follow a
common theme of user input, whereas editors differ
dramatically.</p>

<p>Options to specify addresses as cc (carbon copy) or bcc
(blind carbon copy) were considered to be format details and
were omitted.</p>

<p>A zero exit status implies that all messages were sent,
but it gives no assurances that any of them were actually
delivered. The reliability of the delivery mechanism is
unspecified and is an appropriate marketing distinction
between systems.</p>

<p>In order to conform to the Utility Syntax Guidelines, a
solution was required to the optional file option-argument
to -f. By making file an operand, the guidelines are
satisfied and users remain portable. How- ever, it does
force implementations to support usage such as:</p>

<p>mailx -fin mymail.box</p>

<p>The no name method of unsetting variables is not present
in all histor- ical systems, but it is in System V and
provides a logical set of com- mands corresponding to the
format of the display of options from the mailx set command
without arguments.</p>

<p>The ask and asksub variables are the names selected by
BSD and System V, respectively, for the same feature. They
are synonyms in this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001.</p>

<p>The mailx echo command was not documented in the BSD
version and has been omitted here because it is not
obviously useful for interactive users.</p>

<p>The default prompt on the System V mailx is a question
mark, on BSD Mail an ampersand. Since this volume of IEEE
Std 1003.1-2001 chose the mailx name, it kept the System V
default, assuming that BSD users would not have difficulty
with this minor incompatibility (that they can
override).</p>

<p>The meanings of r and R are reversed between System V
mailx and SunOS Mail. Once again, since this volume of IEEE
Std 1003.1-2001 chose the mailx name, it kept the System V
default, but allows the SunOS user to achieve the desired
results using flipr, an internal variable in System V mailx,
although it has not been documented in the SVID.</p>

<p>The indentprefix variable, the retain and unalias
commands, and the ~F and ~M command escapes were adopted
from 4.3 BSD Mail.</p>

<p>The version command was not included because no
sufficiently general specification of the version
information could be devised that would still be useful to a
portable user. This command name should be used by suppliers
who wish to provide version information about the mailx com-
mand.</p>

<p>The &quot;implementation-specific (unspecified) system
start-up file&quot; his- torically has been named
/etc/mailx.rc, but this specific name and location are not
required.</p>

<p>The intent of the wording for the next command is that
if any command has already displayed the current message it
should display a following message, but, otherwise, it
should display the current message. Con- sider the command
sequence:</p>

<p>next 3 delete 3 next</p>

<p>where the autoprint option was not set. The normative
text specifies that the second next command should display a
message following the third message, because even though the
current message has not been displayed since it was set by
the delete command, it has been displayed since the current
message was anything other than message number 3. This does
not always match historical practice in some
implementations, where the command file address followed by
next (or the default com- mand) would skip the message for
which the user had searched.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
