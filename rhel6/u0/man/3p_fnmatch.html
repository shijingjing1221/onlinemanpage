<p>FNMATCH(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual FNMATCH(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME fnmatch - match a filename or a pathname</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;fnmatch.h&gt;</p>

<p>int fnmatch(const char *pattern, const char *string, int
flags);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The fnmatch() function shall match patterns
as described in the Shell and Utilities volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001, Section 2.13.1, Patterns Matching a Single
Character, and Section 2.13.2, Patterns Matching Mul- tiple
Characters. It checks the string specified by the string
argu- ment to see if it matches the pattern specified by the
pattern argu- ment.</p>

<p>The flags argument shall modify the interpretation of
pattern and string. It is the bitwise-inclusive OR of zero
or more of the flags defined in &lt;fnmatch.h&gt;. If the
FNM_PATHNAME flag is set in flags, then a slash character (/
) in string shall be explicitly matched by a slash in
pattern; it shall not be matched by either the asterisk or
question-mark special characters, nor by a bracket
expression. If the FNM_PATHNAME flag is not set, the slash
character shall be treated as an ordinary character.</p>

<p>If FNM_NOESCAPE is not set in flags, a backslash
character () in pattern followed by any other character
shall match that second charac- ter in string. In
particular, \ If FNM_NOESCAPE is set, a backslash character
shall be treated as an ordinary character.</p>

<p>If FNM_PERIOD is set in flags, then a leading period (.
) in string shall match a period in pattern; as described by
rule 2 in the Shell and Utilities volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001, Section 2.13.3, Patterns Used for Filename
Expansion where the location of &quot;leading&quot; is indi-
cated by the value of FNM_PATHNAME:</p>

<p>* If FNM_PATHNAME is set, a period is
&quot;leading&quot; if it is the first character in string
or if it immediately follows a slash.</p>

<p>* If FNM_PATHNAME is not set, a period is
&quot;leading&quot; only if it is the first character of
string.</p>

<p>If FNM_PERIOD is not set, then no special restrictions
are placed on matching a period.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE If string matches the pattern specified by
pattern, then fnmatch() shall return 0. If there is no
match, fnmatch() shall return FNM_NOMATCH, which is defined
in &lt;fnmatch.h&gt;. If an error occurs, fnmatch() shall
return another non-zero value.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The fnmatch() function has two major
uses. It could be used by an application or utility that
needs to read a directory and apply a pat- tern against each
entry. The find utility is an example of this. It can also
be used by the pax utility to process its pattern operands,
or by applications that need to match strings in a similar
manner.</p>

<p>The name fnmatch() is intended to imply filename match,
rather than pathname match. The default action of this
function is to match file- names, rather than pathnames,
since it gives no special significance to the slash
character. With the FNM_PATHNAME flag, fnmatch() does match
pathnames, but without tilde expansion, parameter expansion,
or special treatment for a period at the beginning of a
filename.</p>

<p>RATIONALE This function replaced the REG_FILENAME flag
of regcomp() in early pro- posals of this volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001. It provides virtually the same functionality as
the regcomp() and regexec() functions using the REG_FILENAME
and REG_FSLASH flags (the REG_FSLASH flag was proposed for
regcomp(), and would have had the opposite effect from
FNM_PATH- NAME), but with a simpler function and less system
overhead.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
