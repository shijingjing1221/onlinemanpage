<p>NAME slapd-ldap - LDAP backend to slapd</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS /etc/openldap/slapd.conf</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The LDAP backend to slapd(8) is not an
actual database; instead it acts as a proxy to forward
incoming requests to another LDAP server. While processing
requests it will also chase referrals, so that referrals are
fully processed instead of being returned to the slapd
client.</p>

<p>Sessions that explicitly Bind to the back-ldap database
always create their own private connection to the remote
LDAP server. Anonymous ses- sions will share a single
anonymous connection to the remote server. For sessions
bound through other mechanisms, all sessions with the same
DN will share the same connection. This connection pooling
strategy can enhance the proxys efficiency by reducing the
overhead of repeatedly making/breaking multiple
connections.</p>

<p>The ldap database can also act as an information
service, i.e. the identity of locally authenticated clients
is asserted to the remote server, possibly in some modified
form. For this purpose, the proxy binds to the remote server
with some administrative identity, and, if required,
authorizes the asserted identity. See the idassert-* rules
below. The administrative identity of the proxy, on the
remote server, must be allowed to authorize by means of
appropriate authzTo rules; see slapd.conf(5) for
details.</p>

<p>The proxy instance of slapd(8) must contain schema
information for the attributes and objectClasses used in
filters, request DN and request- related data in general. It
should also contain schema information for the data returned
by the proxied server. It is the responsibility of the proxy
administrator to keep the schema of the proxy lined up with
that of the proxied server.</p>

<p>Note: When looping back to the same instance of
slapd(8), each connec- tion requires a new thread; as a
consequence, slapd(8) must be compiled with thread support,
and the threads parameter may need some tuning; in those
cases, one may consider using slapd-relay(5) instead, which
per- forms the relayed operation internally and thus reuses
the same connec- tion.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION These slapd.conf options apply to the LDAP
backend database. That is, they must follow a &quot;database
ldap&quot; line and come before any subsequent
&quot;backend&quot; or &quot;database&quot; lines. Other
database options are described in the slapd.conf(5) manual
page.</p>

<p>Note: In early versions of back-ldap it was recommended
to always set</p>

<p>lastmod off</p>

<p>for ldap and meta databases. This was required because
operational attributes related to entry creation and
modification should not be proxied, as they could be
mistakenly written to the target server(s), generating an
error. The current implementation automatically sets lastmod
to off, so its use is redundant and should be omitted.</p>

<p>uri &lt;ldapurl&gt; LDAP server to use. Multiple URIs
can be set in a single lda- purl argument, resulting in the
underlying library automatically call the first server of
the list that responds, e.g.</p>

<p>uri &quot;ldap://host/ ldap://backup-host/&quot;</p>

<p>The URI list is space- or comma-separated. Whenever the
server that responds is not the first one in the list, the
list is rearranged and the responsive server is moved to the
head, so that it will be first contacted the next time a
connection needs be created.</p>

<p>acl-bind bindmethod=simple|sasl [binddn=&lt;simple
DN&gt;] [credentials=&lt;simple password&gt;]
[saslmech=&lt;SASL mech&gt;] [secprops=&lt;properties&gt;]

[authzId=&lt;authorization ID&gt;]

[tls_cacertdir=&lt;path&gt;]
[tls_reqcert=never|allow|try|demand]
[tls_ciphersuite=&lt;ciphers&gt;]
[tls_protocol_min=&lt;version&gt;]
[tls_crlcheck=none|peer|all] Allows to define the parameters
of the authentication method that is internally used by the
proxy to collect info related to access control, and
whenever an operation occurs with the identity of the rootdn
of the LDAP proxy database. The identity defined by this
directive, according to the properties associated to the
authentication method, is supposed to have read access on
the target server to attributes used on the proxy for ACL
checking.</p>

<p>There is no risk of giving away such values; they are
only used to check permissions. The default is to use simple
bind, with empty binddn and credentials, which means that
the related operations will be performed anonymously. If not
set, and if idassert-bind is defined, this latter identity
is used instead. See idassert-bind for details.</p>

<p>The connection between the proxy database and the remote
server associated to this identity is cached regardless of
the lifespan of the client-proxy connection that first
established it.</p>

<p>This identity is by no means implicitly used by the
proxy when the client connects anonymously. The
idassert-bind feature, instead, in some cases can be crafted
to implement that behavior, which is intrinsically unsafe
and should be used with extreme care. This directive
obsoletes acl-authcDN, and acl-passwd.</p>

<p>The TLS settings default to the same as the main slapd
TLS settings, except for tls_reqcert which defaults to
&quot;demand&quot;.</p>

<p>cancel {ABANDON|ignore|exop[-discover]} Defines how to
handle operation cancellation. By default, abandon is
invoked, so the operation is abandoned immediately. If set
to ignore, no action is taken and any further response is
ignored; this may result in further response messages to be
queued for that connection, so it is recommended that long
lasting connections are timed out either by idle-timeout or
conn-ttl, so that resources eventually get released. If set
to exop, a cancel operation (RFC 3909) is issued, resulting
in the cancellation of the current operation; the cancel
operation waits for remote server response, so its use may
not be recommended. If set to exop-discover, support of the
cancel extended operation is detected by reading the remote
servers root DSE.</p>

<p>chase-referrals {YES|no} enable/disable automatic
referral chasing, which is delegated to the underlying
libldap, with rebinding eventually performed if the
rebind-as-user directive is used. The default is to chase
referrals.</p>

<p>conn-ttl &lt;time&gt; This directive causes a cached
connection to be dropped an recreated after a given ttl,
regardless of being idle or not.</p>

<p>idassert-authzFrom &lt;authz-regexp&gt; if defined,
selects what local identities are authorized to exploit the
identity assertion feature. The string &lt;authz- regexp&gt;
follows the rules defined for the authzFrom attribute. See
slapd.conf(5), section related to authz-policy, for details
on the syntax of this field.</p>

<p>idassert-bind bindmethod=none|simple|sasl
[binddn=&lt;simple DN&gt;] [credentials=&lt;simple
password&gt;] [saslmech=&lt;SASL mech&gt;]
[secprops=&lt;properties&gt;] [realm=&lt;realm&gt;]
[authcId=&lt;authentication ID&gt;]
[authzId=&lt;authorization ID&gt;]
[authz={native|proxyauthz}] [mode=&lt;mode&gt;]

[tls_cert=&lt;file&gt;] [tls_key=&lt;file&gt;]
[tls_cacert=&lt;file&gt;] [tls_cacertdir=&lt;path&gt;]
[tls_reqcert=never|allow|try|demand]
[tls_ciphersuite=&lt;ciphers&gt;]
[tls_protocol_min=&lt;version&gt;]
[tls_crlcheck=none|peer|all] Allows to define the parameters
of the authentication method that is internally used by the
proxy to authorize connections that are authenticated by
other databases. The identity defined by this directive,
according to the properties associated to the authentication
method, is supposed to have auth access on the target server
to attributes used on the proxy for authentication and
authorization, and to be allowed to authorize the users.
This requires to have proxyAuthz privileges on a wide set of
DNs, e.g. authzTo=dn.subtree:&quot;&quot;, and the remote
server to have authz-policy set to to or both. See
slapd.conf(5) for details on these statements and for
remarks and drawbacks about their usage. The supported
bindmethods are</p>

<p>none|simple|sasl</p>

<p>where none is the default, i.e. no identity assertion is
performed.</p>

<p>The authz parameter is used to instruct the SASL bind to
exploit native SASL authorization, if available; since
connections are cached, this should only be used when
authorizing with a fixed identity (e.g. by means of the
authzDN or authzID parameters). Otherwise, the default
proxyauthz is used, i.e. the proxyAuthz control (Proxied
Authorization, RFC 4370) is added to all operations.</p>

<p>The supported modes are:</p>

<p>&lt;mode&gt; := {legacy|anonymous|none|self}</p>

<p>If &lt;mode&gt; is not present, and authzId is given,
the proxy always authorizes that identity. &lt;authorization
ID&gt; can be</p>

<p>u:&lt;user&gt;</p>

<p>[dn:]&lt;DN&gt;</p>

<p>The former is supposed to be expanded by the remote
server according to the authz rules; see slapd.conf(5) for
details. In the latter case, whether or not the dn: prefix
is present, the string must pass DN validation and
normalization.</p>

<p>The default mode is legacy, which implies that the proxy
will either perform a simple bind as the authcDN or a SASL
bind as the authcID and assert the client s identity when it
is not anonymous. Direct binds are always proxied. The other
modes imply that the proxy will always either perform a
simple bind as the authcDN or a SASL bind as the authcID,
unless restricted by idassert-authzFrom rules (see below),
in which case the operation will fail; eventually, it will
assert some other identity according to &lt;mode&gt;. Other
identity assertion modes are anonymous and self, which
respectively mean that the empty or the clients identity
will be asserted; none, which means that no proxyAuthz
control will be used, so the authcDN or the authcID identity
will be asserted. For all modes that require the use of the
proxyAuthz control, on the remote server the proxy identity
must have appropriate authzTo permissions, or the asserted
identities must have appropriate authzFrom permissions.
Note, however, that the ID assertion feature is mostly
useful when the asserted identities do not exist on the
remote server.</p>

<p>Flags can be</p>

<p>override,[non-]prescriptive</p>

<p>When the override flag is used, identity assertion takes
place even when the database is authorizing for the identity
of the client, i.e. after binding with the provided
identity, and thus authenticating it, the proxy performs the
identity assertion using the configured identity and
authentication method.</p>

<p>When the prescriptive flag is used (the default),
operations fail with inappropriateAuthentication for those
identities whose assertion is not allowed by the
idassert-authzFrom patterns. If the non-prescriptive flag is
used, operations are performed anonymously for those
identities whose assertion is not allowed by the
idassert-authzFrom patterns.</p>

<p>The TLS settings default to the same as the main slapd
TLS settings, except for tls_reqcert which defaults to
&quot;demand&quot;.</p>

<p>The identity associated to this directive is also used
for privileged operations whenever idassert-bind is defined
and acl-bind is not. See acl-bind for details.</p>

<p>This directive obsoletes idassert-authcDN,
idassert-passwd, idassert-mode, and idassert-method.</p>

<p>idle-timeout &lt;time&gt; This directive causes a cached
connection to be dropped an recreated after it has been idle
for the specified time.</p>

<p>network-timeout &lt;time&gt; Sets the network timeout
value after which poll(2)/select(2) following a connect(2)
returns in case of no activity. The value is in seconds, and
it can be specified as for idle-timeout.</p>

<p>norefs &lt;NO|yes&gt; If yes, do not return search
reference responses. By default, they are returned unless
request is LDAPv2.</p>

<p>noundeffilter &lt;NO|yes&gt; If yes, return success
instead of searching if a filter is undefined or contains
undefined portions. By default, the search is propagated
after replacing undefined portions with (!(objectClass=*)),
which corresponds to the empty result set.</p>

<p>protocol-version {0,2,3} This directive indicates what
protocol version must be used to contact the remote server.
If set to 0 (the default), the proxy uses the same protocol
version used by the client, otherwise the requested protocol
is used. The proxy returns unwillingToPerform if an
operation that is incompatible with the requested protocol
is attempted.</p>

<p>proxy-whoami {NO|yes} Turns on proxying of the WhoAmI
extended operation. If this option is given, back-ldap will
replace slapds original WhoAmI routine with its own. On
slapd sessions that were authenticated by back-ldap, the
WhoAmI request will be forwarded to the remote LDAP server.
Other sessions will be handled by the local slapd, as
before. This option is mainly useful in conjunction with
Proxy Authorization.</p>

<p>quarantine
&lt;interval&gt;,&lt;num&gt;[;&lt;interval&gt;,&lt;num&gt;[...]]
Turns on quarantine of URIs that returned LDAP_UNAVAILABLE,
so that an attempt to reconnect only occurs at given
intervals instead of any time a client requests an
operation. The pattern is: retry only after at least
interval seconds elapsed since last attempt, for exactly num
times; then use the next pattern. If num for the last
pattern is &quot;+&quot;, it retries forever; otherwise, no
more retries occur. The process can be restarted by
resetting the olcDbQuarantine attribute of the database
entry in the configuration backend.</p>

<p>rebind-as-user {NO|yes} If this option is given, the
client s bind credentials are remembered for rebinds, when
trying to re-establish a broken connection, or when chasing
a referral, if chase-referrals is set to yes.</p>

<p>session-tracking-request {NO|yes} Adds session tracking
control for all requests. The clients IP and hostname, and
the identity associated to each request, if known, are sent
to the remote server for informational purposes. This
directive is incompatible with setting protocol-version to
2.</p>

<p>single-conn {NO|yes} Discards current cached connection
when the client rebinds.</p>

<p>t-f-support {NO|yes|discover} enable if the remote
server supports absolute filters (see
draft-zeilenga-ldap-t-f for details). If set to discover,
support is detected by reading the remote server s root
DSE.</p>

<p>timeout [&lt;op&gt;=]&lt;val&gt; [...] This directive
allows to set per-operation timeouts. Operations can be</p>

<p>&lt;op&gt; ::= bind, add, delete, modrdn, modify,
compare, search</p>

<p>The overall duration of the search operation is
controlled either by the timelimit parameter or by
server-side enforced time limits (see timelimit and limits
in slapd.conf(5) for details). This timeout parameter
controls how long the target can be irresponsive before the
operation is aborted. Timeout is meaningless for the
remaining operations, unbind and abandon, which do not imply
any response, while it is not yet implemented in currently
supported extended operations. If no operation is specified,
the timeout val affects all supported operations.</p>

<p>Note: if the timelimit is exceeded, the operation is
cancelled (according to the cancel directive); the protocol
does not provide any means to rollback operations, so the
client will not be notified about the result of the
operation, which may eventually succeeded or not. In case
the timeout is exceeded during a bind operation, the
connection is destroyed, according to RFC4511.</p>

<p>Note: in some cases, this backend may issue binds prior
to other operations (e.g. to bind anonymously or with some
prescribed identity according to the idassert-bind
directive). In this case, the timeout of the operation that
resulted in the bind is used.</p>

<p>tls {[try-]start|[try-]propagate|ldaps}
[tls_cert=&lt;file&gt;] [tls_key=&lt;file&gt;]
[tls_cacert=&lt;file&gt;] [tls_cacertdir=&lt;path&gt;]
[tls_reqcert=never|allow|try|demand]
[tls_ciphersuite=&lt;ciphers&gt;]
[tls_crlcheck=none|peer|all] Specify the use of TLS when a
regular connection is initialized. The StartTLS extended
operation will be used unless the URI directive protocol
scheme is ldaps://. In that case this keyword may only be
set to &quot;ldaps&quot; and the StartTLS operation will not
be used. propagate issues the StartTLS operation only if the
original connection did. The try- prefix instructs the proxy
to continue operations if the StartTLS operation failed; its
use is not recommended.</p>

<p>The TLS settings default to the same as the main slapd
TLS settings, except for tls_reqcert which defaults to
&quot;demand&quot;.</p>

<p>use-temporary-conn {NO|yes} when set to yes, create a
temporary connection whenever competing with other threads
for a shared one; otherwise, wait until the shared
connection is available.</p>

<p>BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY The LDAP backend has been heavily
reworked between releases 2.2 and 2.3, and subsequently
between 2.3 and 2.4. As a side-effect, some of the
traditional directives have been deprecated and should be no
longer used, as they might disappear in future releases.</p>

<p>acl-authcDN &lt;administrative DN for access control
purposes&gt; Formerly known as the binddn, it is the DN that
is used to query the target server for acl checking; it is
supposed to have read access on the target server to
attributes used on the proxy for acl checking. There is no
risk of giving away such values; they are only used to check
permissions.</p>

<p>The acl-authcDN identity is by no means implicitly used
by the proxy when the client connects anonymously. The
idassert-* feature can be used (at own risk) for that
purpose instead.</p>

<p>This directive is obsoleted by the binddn arg of
acl-bind when bindmethod=simple, and will be dismissed in
the future.</p>

<p>acl-passwd &lt;password&gt; Formerly known as the
bindpw, it is the password used with the above acl-authcDN
directive. This directive is obsoleted by the credentials
arg of acl-bind when bindmethod=simple, and will be
dismissed in the future.</p>

<p>idassert-authcDN &lt;administrative DN for proxyAuthz
purposes&gt; DN which is used to propagate the clients
identity to the target by means of the proxyAuthz control
when the client does not belong to the DIT fragment that is
being proxied by back- ldap. This directive is obsoleted by
the binddn arg of idassert-bind when bindmethod=simple, and
will be dismissed in the future.</p>

<p>idassert-passwd &lt;password&gt; Password used with the
idassert-authcDN above. This directive is obsoleted by the
crendentials arg of idassert-bind when bindmethod=simple,
and will be dismissed in the future.</p>

<p>idassert-mode &lt;mode&gt; [&lt;flags&gt;] defines what
type of identity assertion is used. This directive is
obsoleted by the mode arg of idassert-bind, and will be
dismissed in the future.</p>

<p>idassert-method &lt;method&gt; [&lt;saslargs&gt;] This
directive is obsoleted by the bindmethod arg of
idassert-bind, and will be dismissed in the future.</p>

<p>port &lt;port&gt; this directive is no longer supported.
Use the uri directive as described above.</p>

<p>server &lt;hostname[:port]&gt; this directive is no
longer supported. Use the uri directive as described
above.</p>

<p>suffixmassage, map, rewrite* These directives are no
longer supported by back-ldap; their functionality is now
delegated to the rwm overlay. Essentially, add a
statement</p>

<p>overlay rwm</p>

<p>first, and prefix all rewrite/map statements with rwm-
to obtain the original behavior. See slapo-rwm(5) for
details.</p>

<p>ACCESS CONTROL The ldap backend does not honor all ACL
semantics as described in slapd.access(5). In general,
access checking is delegated to the remote server(s). Only
read (=r) access to the entry pseudo-attribute and to the
other attribute values of the entries returned by the search
operation is honored, which is performed by the
frontend.</p>

<p>OVERLAYS The LDAP backend provides basic proxying
functionalities to many overlays. The chain overlay,
described in slapo-chain(5), and the translucent overlay,
described in slapo-translucent(5), deserve a special
mention.</p>

<p>Conversely, there are many overlays that are best used
in conjunction with the LDAP backend. The proxycache overlay
allows caching of LDAP search requests (queries) in a local
database. See slapo-pcache(5) for details. The rwm overlay
provides DN rewrite and attribute/objectClass mapping
capabilities to the underlying database. See slapo-rwm(5)
for details.</p>
