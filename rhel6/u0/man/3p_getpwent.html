<p>ENDPWENT(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual ENDPWENT(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME endpwent, getpwent, setpwent - user database
functions</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;pwd.h&gt;</p>

<p>void endpwent(void); struct passwd *getpwent(void); void
setpwent(void);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION These functions shall retrieve information
about users.</p>

<p>The getpwent() function shall return a pointer to a
structure contain- ing the broken-out fields of an entry in
the user database. Each entry in the user database contains
a passwd structure. When first called, getpwent() shall
return a pointer to a passwd structure containing the first
entry in the user database. Thereafter, it shall return a
pointer to a passwd structure containing the next entry in
the user database. Successive calls can be used to search
the entire user database.</p>

<p>If an end-of-file or an error is encountered on reading,
getpwent() shall return a null pointer.</p>

<p>An implementation that provides extended security
controls may impose further implementation-defined
restrictions on accessing the user database. In particular,
the system may deny the existence of some or all of the user
database entries associated with users other than the
caller.</p>

<p>The setpwent() function effectively rewinds the user
database to allow repeated searches.</p>

<p>The endpwent() function may be called to close the user
database when processing is complete.</p>

<p>These functions need not be reentrant. A function that
is not required to be reentrant is not required to be
thread-safe.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The getpwent() function shall return a null
pointer on end-of-file or error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The getpwent(), setpwent(), and endpwent()
functions may fail if:</p>

<p>EIO An I/O error has occurred.</p>

<p>In addition, getpwent() and setpwent() may fail if:</p>

<p>EMFILE {OPEN_MAX} file descriptors are currently open in
the calling process.</p>

<p>ENFILE The maximum allowable number of files is
currently open in the system.</p>

<p>The return value may point to a static area which is
overwritten by a subsequent call to getpwuid(), getpwnam(),
or getpwent().</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Searching the User Database The following
example uses the getpwent() function to get successive
entries in the user database, returning a pointer to a
passwd structure that contains information about each user.
The call to endpwent() closes the user database and cleans
up.</p>

<p>#include &lt;pwd.h&gt; ... struct passwd *p; ... while
((p = getpwent ()) != NULL) { ... }</p>

<p>endpwent(); ...</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE These functions are provided due to
their historical usage. Applica- tions should avoid
dependencies on fields in the password database, whether the
database is a single file, or where in the file system name
space the database resides. Applications should use
getpwuid() whenever possible because it avoids these
dependencies.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
