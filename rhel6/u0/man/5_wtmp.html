<p>UTMP(5) Linux Programmer s Manual UTMP(5)</p>

<p>NAME utmp, wtmp - login records</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;utmp.h&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The utmp file allows one to discover
information about who is currently using the system. There
may be more users currently using the system, because not
all programs use utmp logging.</p>

<p>Warning: utmp must not be writable by the user class
&quot;other&quot;, because many system programs (foolishly)
depend on its integrity. You risk faked system logfiles and
modifications of system files if you leave utmp writable to
any user other than the owner and group owner of the
file.</p>

<p>The file is a sequence of utmp structures, declared as
follows in &lt;utmp.h&gt; (note that this is only one of
several definitions around; details depend on the version of
libc):</p>

<p>/* Values for ut_type field, below */</p>

<p>#define EMPTY 0 /* Record does not contain valid info
(formerly known as UT_UNKNOWN on Linux) */ #define RUN_LVL 1
/* Change in system run-level (see init(8)) */ #define
BOOT_TIME 2 /* Time of system boot (in ut_tv) */ #define
NEW_TIME 3 /* Time after system clock change (in ut_tv) */
#define OLD_TIME 4 /* Time before system clock change (in
ut_tv) */ #define INIT_PROCESS 5 /* Process spawned by
init(8) */ #define LOGIN_PROCESS 6 /* Session leader process
for user login */ #define USER_PROCESS 7 /* Normal process
*/ #define DEAD_PROCESS 8 /* Terminated process */ #define
ACCOUNTING 9 /* Not implemented */</p>

<p>#define UT_LINESIZE 32 #define UT_NAMESIZE 32 #define
UT_HOSTSIZE 256</p>

<p>struct exit_status { /* Type for ut_exit, below */ short
int e_termination; /* Process termination status */ short
int e_exit; /* Process exit status */ };</p>

<p>struct utmp { short ut_type; /* Type of record */ pid_t
ut_pid; /* PID of login process */ char
ut_line[UT_LINESIZE]; /* Device name of tty -
&quot;/dev/&quot; */ char ut_id[4]; /* Terminal name suffix,
or inittab(5) ID */ char ut_user[UT_NAMESIZE]; /* Username
*/ char ut_host[UT_HOSTSIZE]; /* Hostname for remote login,
or kernel version for run-level messages */ struct
exit_status ut_exit; /* Exit status of a process marked as
DEAD_PROCESS; not used by Linux init(8) */ /* The ut_session
and ut_tv fields must be the same size when compiled 32- and
64-bit. This allows data files and shared memory to be
shared between 32- and 64-bit applications. */ #if
__WORDSIZE == 64 &amp;&amp; defined __WORDSIZE_COMPAT32
int32_t ut_session; /* Session ID (getsid(2)), used for
windowing */ struct { int32_t tv_sec; /* Seconds */ int32_t
tv_usec; /* Microseconds */ } ut_tv; /* Time entry was made
*/ #else long ut_session; /* Session ID */ struct timeval
ut_tv; /* Time entry was made */ #endif</p>

<p>int32_t ut_addr_v6[4]; /* Internet address of remote
host; IPv4 address uses just ut_addr_v6[0] */ char
__unused[20]; /* Reserved for future use */ };</p>

<p>/* Backwards compatibility hacks */ #define ut_name
ut_user #ifndef _NO_UT_TIME #define ut_time ut_tv.tv_sec
#endif #define ut_xtime ut_tv.tv_sec #define ut_addr
ut_addr_v6[0]</p>

<p>This structure gives the name of the special file
associated with the user s terminal, the user s login name,
and the time of login in the form of time(2). String fields
are terminated by 0&rsquo; if they are shorter than the size
of the field.</p>

<p>The first entries ever created result from init(8)
processing init- tab(5). Before an entry is processed,
though, init(8) cleans up utmp by setting ut_type to
DEAD_PROCESS, clearing ut_user, ut_host, and ut_time with
null bytes for each record which ut_type is not DEAD_PRO-
CESS or RUN_LVL and where no process with PID ut_pid exists.
If no empty record with the needed ut_id can be found,
init(8) creates a new one. It sets ut_id from the inittab,
ut_pid and ut_time to the current values, and ut_type to
INIT_PROCESS.</p>

<p>mingetty(8) (or agetty(8)) locates the entry by the PID,
changes ut_type to LOGIN_PROCESS, changes ut_time, sets
ut_line, and waits for connection to be established.
login(1), after a user has been authen- ticated, changes
ut_type to USER_PROCESS, changes ut_time, and sets ut_host
and ut_addr. Depending on mingetty(8) (or agetty(8)) and
login(1), records may be located by ut_line instead of the
preferable ut_pid.</p>

<p>When init(8) finds that a process has exited, it locates
its utmp entry by ut_pid, sets ut_type to DEAD_PROCESS, and
clears ut_user, ut_host and ut_time with null bytes.</p>

<p>xterm(1) and other terminal emulators directly create a
USER_PROCESS record and generate the ut_id by using the
string that suffix part of the terminal name (the characters
following /dev/[pt]ty). If they find a DEAD_PROCESS for this
ID, they recycle it, otherwise they create a new entry. If
they can, they will mark it as DEAD_PROCESS on exiting and
it is advised that they null ut_line, ut_time, ut_user, and
ut_host as well.</p>

<p>telnetd(8) sets up a LOGIN_PROCESS entry and leaves the
rest to login(1) as usual. After the telnet session ends,
telnetd(8) cleans up utmp in the described way.</p>

<p>The wtmp file records all logins and logouts. Its format
is exactly like utmp except that a null username indicates a
logout on the associ- ated terminal. Furthermore, the
terminal name ~ with username shutdown or reboot indicates a
system shutdown or reboot and the pair of termi- nal names
|/} logs the old/new system time when date(1) changes it.
wtmp is maintained by login(1), init(8), and some versions
of getty(8) (e.g., mingetty(8) or agetty(8)). None of these
programs creates the file, so if it is removed,
record-keeping is turned off.</p>

<p>FILES /var/run/utmp /var/log/wtmp</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO POSIX.1 does not specify a utmp structure,
but rather one named utmpx, with specifications for the
fields ut_type, ut_pid, ut_line, ut_id, ut_user, and ut_tv.
POSIX.1 does not specify the lengths of the ut_line and
ut_user fields.</p>

<p>Linux defines the utmpx structure to be the same as the
utmp structure.</p>

<p>Comparison with Historical Systems Linux utmp entries
conform neither to v7/BSD nor to System V; they are a mix of
the two.</p>

<p>v7/BSD has fewer fields; most importantly it lacks
ut_type, which causes native v7/BSD-like programs to display
(for example) dead or login entries. Further, there is no
configuration file which allocates slots to sessions. BSD
does so because it lacks ut_id fields.</p>

<p>In Linux (as in System V), the ut_id field of a record
will never change once it has been set, which reserves that
slot without needing a configuration file. Clearing ut_id
may result in race conditions lead- ing to corrupted utmp
entries and potential security holes. Clearing the
abovementioned fields by filling them with null bytes is not
required by System V semantics, but makes it possible to run
many pro- grams which assume BSD semantics and which do not
modify utmp. Linux uses the BSD conventions for line
contents, as documented above.</p>

<p>System V has no ut_host or ut_addr_v6 fields.</p>

<p>NOTES Unlike various other systems, where utmp logging
can be disabled by removing the file, utmp must always exist
on Linux. If you want to disable who(1) then do not make
utmp world readable.</p>

<p>The file format is machine-dependent, so it is
recommended that it be processed only on the machine
architecture where it was created.</p>

<p>Note that on biarch platforms, that is, systems which
can run both 32-bit and 64-bit applications (x86-64, ppc64,
s390x, etc.), ut_tv is the same size in 32-bit mode as in
64-bit mode. The same goes for ut_session and ut_time if
they are present. This allows data files and shared memory
to be shared between 32-bit and 64-bit applications. This is
achieved by changing the type of ut_session to int32_t, and
that of ut_tv to a struct with two int32_t fields tv_sec and
tv_usec. Since ut_tv may not be the same as struct timeval,
then instead of the call:</p>

<p>gettimeofday((struct timeval *) &amp;ut.ut_tv,
NULL);</p>

<p>the following method of setting this field is
recommended:</p>

<p>struct utmp ut; struct timeval tv;</p>

<p>gettimeofday(&amp;tv, NULL); ut.ut_tv.tv_sec =
tv.tv_sec; ut.ut_tv.tv_usec = tv.tv_usec;</p>

<p>Note that the utmp struct from libc5 has changed in
libc6. Because of this, binaries using the old libc5 struct
will corrupt /var/run/utmp and/or /var/log/wtmp.</p>

<p>BUGS This man page is based on the libc5 one, things may
work differently now.</p>
