<p>PERL595DELTA(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERL595DELTA(1)</p>

<p>NAME perl595delta - what is new for perl v5.9.5</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This document describes differences between
the 5.9.4 and the 5.9.5 development releases. See
perl590delta, perl591delta, perl592delta, perl593delta and
perl594delta for the differences between 5.8.0 and
5.9.4.</p>

<p>Incompatible Changes Tainting and printf When perl is
run under taint mode, &quot;printf()&quot; and
&quot;sprintf()&quot; will now reject any tainted format
argument. (Rafael Garcia-Suarez)</p>

<p>undef and signal handlers Undefining or deleting a
signal handler via &quot;undef $SIG{FOO}&quot; is now
equivalent to setting it to &rsquo;DEFAULT&rsquo;.
(Rafael)</p>

<p>strictures and array/hash dereferencing in defined()
&quot;defined @$foo&quot; and &quot;defined %$bar&quot; are
now subject to &quot;strict &rsquo;refs&rsquo;&quot; (that
is, $foo and $bar shall be proper references there.)
(Nicholas Clark)</p>

<p>(However, &quot;defined(@foo)&quot; and
&quot;defined(%bar)&quot; are discouraged constructs
anyway.)</p>

<p>&quot;(?p{})&quot; has been removed The regular
expression construct &quot;(?p{})&quot;, which was
deprecated in perl 5.8, has been removed. Use
&quot;(??{})&quot; instead. (Rafael)</p>

<p>Pseudo-hashes have been removed Support for
pseudo-hashes has been removed from Perl 5.9. (The
&quot;fields&quot; pragma remains here, but uses an
alternate implementation.)</p>

<p>Removal of the bytecode compiler and of perlcc
&quot;perlcc&quot;, the byteloader and the supporting
modules (B::C, B::CC, B::Bytecode, etc.) are no longer
distributed with the perl sources. Those experimental tools
have never worked reliably, and, due to the lack of
volunteers to keep them in line with the perl interpreter
developments, it was decided to remove them instead of
shipping a broken version of those. The last version of
those modules can be found with perl 5.9.4.</p>

<p>However the B compiler framework stays supported in the
perl core, as with the more useful modules it has permitted
(among others, B::Deparse and B::Concise).</p>

<p>Removal of the JPL The JPL (Java-Perl Linguo) has been
removed from the perl sources tarball.</p>

<p>Recursive inheritance detected earlier Perl will now
immediately throw an exception if you modify any packages
@ISA in such a way that it would cause recursive
inheritance.</p>

<p>Previously, the exception would not occur until Perl
attempted to make use of the recursive inheritance while
resolving a method or doing a &quot;$foo-&gt;isa($bar)&quot;
lookup.</p>

<p>Core Enhancements Regular expressions Recursive Patterns
It is now possible to write recursive patterns without using
the &quot;(??{})&quot; construct. This new way is more
efficient, and in many cases easier to read.</p>

<p>Each capturing parenthesis can now be treated as an
independent pattern that can be entered by using the
&quot;(?PARNO)&quot; syntax (&quot;PARNO&quot; standing for
&quot;parenthesis number&quot;). For example, the following
pattern will match nested balanced angle brackets:</p>

<p>/ ^ # start of line ( # start capture buffer 1 &lt; #
match an opening angle bracket (?: # match one of: (?&gt; #
don&rsquo;t backtrack over the inside of this group
[^&lt;&gt;]+ # one or more non angle brackets ) # end non
backtracking group | # ... or ... (?1) # recurse to bracket
1 and try it again )* # 0 or more times. &gt; # match a
closing angle bracket ) # end capture buffer one $ # end of
line /x</p>

<p>Note, users experienced with PCRE will find that the
Perl implementation of this feature differs from the PCRE
one in that it is possible to backtrack into a recursed
pattern, whereas in PCRE the recursion is atomic or
&quot;possessive&quot; in nature. (Yves Orton)</p>

<p>Named Capture Buffers It is now possible to name
capturing parenthesis in a pattern and refer to the captured
contents by name. The naming syntax is
&quot;(?&lt;NAME&gt;....)&quot;. Its possible to
backreference to a named buffer with the
&quot;NAME&gt;&quot; syntax. In code, the new magical hashes
&quot;%+&quot; and &quot;%-&quot; can be used to access the
contents of the capture buffers.</p>

<p>Thus, to replace all doubled chars, one could write</p>

<p>s/(?&lt;letter&gt;.)letter&gt;/$+{letter}/g</p>

<p>Only buffers with defined contents will be
&quot;visible&quot; in the &quot;%+&quot; hash, so its
possible to do something like</p>

<p>foreach my $name (keys %+) { print &quot;content of
buffer &rsquo;$name&rsquo; is $+{$name}0; }</p>

<p>The &quot;%-&quot; hash is a bit more complete, since it
will contain array refs holding values from all capture
buffers similarly named, if there should be many of
them.</p>

<p>&quot;%+&quot; and &quot;%-&quot; are implemented as
tied hashes through the new module
&quot;Tie::Hash::NamedCapture&quot;.</p>

<p>Users exposed to the .NET regex engine will find that
the perl implementation differs in that the numerical
ordering of the buffers is sequential, and not &quot;unnamed
first, then named&quot;. Thus in the pattern</p>

<p>/(A)(?&lt;B&gt;B)(C)(?&lt;D&gt;D)/</p>

<p>$1 will be A, $2 will be B, $3 will be C and $4 will be
D and not $1 is A, $2 is C and $3 is B and $4 is D that a
.NET programmer would expect. This is considered a feature.
:-) (Yves Orton)</p>

<p>Possessive Quantifiers Perl now supports the
&quot;possessive quantifier&quot; syntax of the &quot;atomic
match&quot; pattern. Basically a possessive quantifier
matches as much as it can and never gives any back. Thus it
can be used to control backtracking. The syntax is similar
to non-greedy matching, except instead of using a ? as the
modifier the + is used. Thus &quot;?+&quot;, &quot;*+&quot;,
&quot;++&quot;, &quot;{min,max}+&quot; are now legal
quantifiers. (Yves Orton)</p>

<p>Backtracking control verbs The regex engine now supports
a number of special-purpose backtrack control verbs:
(*THEN), (*PRUNE), (*MARK), (*SKIP), (*COMMIT), (*FAIL) and
(*ACCEPT). See perlre for their descriptions. (Yves
Orton)</p>

<p>Relative backreferences A new syntax &quot;N}&quot; or
&quot;&quot; where &quot;N&quot; is a decimal integer allows
a safer form of back-reference notation as well as allowing
relative backreferences. This should make it easier to
generate and embed patterns that contain backreferences. See
&quot;Capture buffers&quot; in perlre. (Yves Orton)</p>

<p>&quot;K&quot; escape The functionality of Jeff Pinyans
module Regexp::Keep has been added to the core. You can now
use in regular expressions the special escape &quot;K&quot;
as a way to do something like floating length positive
lookbehind. It is also useful in substitutions like:</p>

<p>s/(foo)bar/$1/g</p>

<p>that can now be converted to</p>

<p>s/fooKbar//g</p>

<p>which is much more efficient. (Yves Orton)</p>

<p>Vertical and horizontal whitespace, and linebreak
Regular expressions now recognize the &quot;nd &quot;scapes,
that match vertical and horizontal whitespace, respectively.
&quot; and &quot;ogically match their complements.</p>

<p>&quot; generic linebreak, that is, vertical whitespace,
plus the multi-character sequence &quot;DA&quot;.</p>

<p>The &quot;_&quot; prototype A new prototype character
has been added. &quot;_&quot; is equivalent to &quot;$&quot;
(it denotes a scalar), but defaults to $_ if the
corresponding argument isnt supplied. Due to the optional
nature of the argument, you can only use it at the end of a
prototype, or before a semicolon.</p>

<p>This has a small incompatible consequence: the
prototype() function has been adjusted to return
&quot;_&quot; for some built-ins in appropriate cases (for
example, &quot;prototype(&rsquo;CORE::rmdir&rsquo;)&quot;).
(Rafael)</p>

<p>UNITCHECK blocks &quot;UNITCHECK&quot;, a new special
code block has been introduced, in addition to
&quot;BEGIN&quot;, &quot;CHECK&quot;, &quot;INIT&quot; and
&quot;END&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;CHECK&quot; and &quot;INIT&quot; blocks, while
useful for some specialized purposes, are always executed at
the transition between the compilation and the execution of
the main program, and thus are useless whenever code is
loaded at runtime. On the other hand, &quot;UNITCHECK&quot;
blocks are executed just after the unit which defined them
has been compiled. See perlmod for more information. (Alex
Gough)</p>

<p>readpipe() is now overridable The built-in function
readpipe() is now overridable. Overriding it permits also to
override its operator counterpart, &quot;qx//&quot; (a.k.a.
&quot;&lsquo;&lsquo;&quot;). Moreover, it now defaults to $_
if no argument is provided. (Rafael)</p>

<p>default argument for readline() readline() now defaults
to *ARGV if no argument is provided. (Rafael)</p>

<p>UCD 5.0.0 The copy of the Unicode Character Database
included in Perl 5.9 has been updated to version 5.0.0.</p>

<p>Smart match The smart match operator (&quot;~~&quot;) is
now available by default (you dont need to enable it with
&quot;use feature&quot; any longer). (Michael G Schwern)</p>

<p>Implicit loading of &quot;feature&quot; The
&quot;feature&quot; pragma is now implicitly loaded when you
require a minimal perl version (with the &quot;use
VERSION&quot; construct) greater than, or equal to,
5.9.5.</p>

<p>Modules and Pragmas New Pragma, &quot;mro&quot; A new
pragma, &quot;mro&quot; (for Method Resolution Order) has
been added. It permits to switch, on a per-class basis, the
algorithm that perl uses to find inherited methods in case
of a multiple inheritance hierarchy. The default MRO hasn t
changed (DFS, for Depth First Search). Another MRO is
available: the C3 algorithm. See mro for more information.
(Brandon Black)</p>

<p>Note that, due to changes in the implementation of class
hierarchy search, code that used to undef the *ISA glob will
most probably break. Anyway, undefing *ISA had the
side-effect of removing the magic on the @ISA array and
should not have been done in the first place.</p>

<p>bignum, bigint, bigrat The three numeric pragmas
&quot;bignum&quot;, &quot;bigint&quot; and
&quot;bigrat&quot; are now lexically scoped. (Tels)</p>

<p>Math::BigInt/Math::BigFloat Many bugs have been fixed;
noteworthy are comparisons with NaN, which no longer warn
about undef values.</p>

<p>The following things are new:</p>

<p>config() The config() method now also supports the
calling-style &quot;config(&rsquo;lib&rsquo;)&quot; in
addition to
&quot;config()-&gt;{&rsquo;lib&rsquo;}&quot;.</p>

<p>import() Upon import, using &quot;lib =&gt;
&rsquo;Foo&rsquo;&quot; now warns if the low-level library
cannot be found. To suppress the warning, you can use
&quot;try =&gt; &rsquo;Foo&rsquo;&quot; instead. To convert
the warning into a die, use &quot;only =&gt;
&rsquo;Foo&rsquo;&quot; instead.</p>

<p>roundmode common A rounding mode of &quot;common&quot;
is now supported.</p>

<p>Also, support for the following methods has been
added:</p>

<p>bpi(), bcos(), bsin(), batan(), batan2() bmuladd()
bexp(), bnok() from_hex(), from_oct(), and from_bin()
as_oct()</p>

<p>In addition, the default math-backend (Calc (Perl) and
FastCalc (XS)) now support storing numbers in parts with 9
digits instead of 7 on Perls with either 64bit integer or
long double support. This means math operations scale better
and are thus faster for really big numbers.</p>

<p>New Core Modules &middot;
&quot;Locale::Maketext::Simple&quot;, needed by CPANPLUS, is
a simple wrapper around
&quot;Locale::Maketext::Lexicon&quot;. Note that
&quot;Locale::Maketext::Lexicon&quot; isnt included in the
perl core; the behaviour of
&quot;Locale::Maketext::Simple&quot; gracefully degrades
when the later isnt present.</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;Params::Check&quot; implements a generic
input parsing/checking mechanism. It is used by
CPANPLUS.</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;Term::UI&quot; simplifies the task to ask
questions at a terminal prompt.</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;Object::Accessor&quot; provides an
interface to create per-object accessors.</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;Module::Pluggable&quot; is a simple
framework to create modules that accept pluggable
sub-modules.</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;Module::Load::Conditional&quot; provides
simple ways to query and possibly load installed
modules.</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;Time::Piece&quot; provides an object
oriented interface to time functions, overriding the
built-ins localtime() and gmtime().</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;IPC::Cmd&quot; helps to find and run
external commands, possibly interactively.</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;File::Fetch&quot; provide a simple
generic file fetching mechanism.</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;Log::Message&quot; and
&quot;Log::Message::Simple&quot; are used by the log
facility of &quot;CPANPLUS&quot;.</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;Archive::Extract&quot; is a generic
archive extraction mechanism for .tar (plain, gziped or
bzipped) or .zip files.</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;CPANPLUS&quot; provides an API and a
command-line tool to access the CPAN mirrors.</p>

<p>Module changes &quot;assertions&quot; The
&quot;assertions&quot; pragma, its submodules
&quot;assertions::activate&quot; and
&quot;assertions::compat&quot; and the -A command-line
switch have been removed. The interface was not judged
mature enough for inclusion in a stable release.</p>

<p>&quot;base&quot; The &quot;base&quot; pragma now warns
if a class tries to inherit from itself. (Curtis
&quot;Ovid&quot; Poe)</p>

<p>&quot;strict&quot; and &quot;warnings&quot;
&quot;strict&quot; and &quot;warnings&quot; will now
complain loudly if they are loaded via incorrect casing (as
in &quot;use Strict;&quot;). (Johan Vromans)</p>

<p>&quot;warnings&quot; The &quot;warnings&quot; pragma
doesnt load &quot;Carp&quot; anymore. That means that code
that used &quot;Carp&quot; routines without having loaded it
at compile time might need to be adjusted; typically, the
following (faulty) code won t work anymore, and will require
parentheses to be added after the function name:</p>

<p>use warnings; require Carp; Carp::confess
&quot;argh&quot;;</p>

<p>&quot;less&quot; &quot;less&quot; now does something
useful (or at least it tries to). In fact, it has been
turned into a lexical pragma. So, in your modules, you can
now test whether your users have requested to use less CPU,
or less memory, less magic, or maybe even less fat. See less
for more. (Joshua ben Jore)</p>

<p>&quot;Attribute::Handlers&quot;
&quot;Attribute::Handlers&quot; can now report the callers
file and line number. (David Feldman)</p>

<p>&quot;B::Lint&quot; &quot;B::Lint&quot; is now based on
&quot;Module::Pluggable&quot;, and so can be extended with
plugins. (Joshua ben Jore)</p>

<p>&quot;B&quot; Its now possible to access the lexical
pragma hints (&quot;%^H&quot;) by using the method
B::COP::hints_hash(). It returns a &quot;B::RHE&quot;
object, which in turn can be used to get a hash reference
via the method B::RHE::HASH(). (Joshua ben Jore)</p>

<p>&quot;Thread&quot; As the old 5005thread threading model
has been removed, in favor of the ithreads scheme, the
&quot;Thread&quot; module is now a compatibility wrapper, to
be used in old code only. It has been removed from the
default list of dynamic extensions.</p>

<p>Utility Changes &quot;cpanp&quot; &quot;cpanp&quot;, the
CPANPLUS shell, has been added. (&quot;cpanp-run-perl&quot;,
an helper for CPANPLUS operation, has been added too, but
isn t intended for direct use).</p>

<p>&quot;cpan2dist&quot; &quot;cpan2dist&quot; is a new
utility, that comes with CPANPLUS. It s a tool to create
distributions (or packages) from CPAN modules.</p>

<p>&quot;pod2html&quot; The output of &quot;pod2html&quot;
has been enhanced to be more customizable via CSS. Some
formatting problems were also corrected. (Jari Aalto)</p>

<p>Documentation New manpage, perlunifaq A new manual page,
perlunifaq (the Perl Unicode FAQ), has been added (Juerd
Waalboer).</p>

<p>Installation and Configuration Improvements C++
compatibility Efforts have been made to make perl and the
core XS modules compilable with various C++ compilers
(although the situation is not perfect with some of the
compilers on some of the platforms tested.)</p>

<p>Visual C++ Perl now can be compiled with Microsoft
Visual C++ 2005.</p>

<p>Static build on Win32 Its now possible to build a
&quot;perl-static.exe&quot; that doesn t depend on
&quot;perl59.dll&quot; on Win32. See the Win32 makefiles for
details. (Vadim Konovalov)</p>

<p>win32 builds All win32 builds (MS-Win, WinCE) have been
merged and cleaned up.</p>

<p>&quot;d_pseudofork&quot; and
&quot;d_printf_format_null&quot; A new configuration
variable, available as $Config{d_pseudofork} in the Config
module, has been added, to distinguish real fork() support
from fake pseudofork used on Windows platforms.</p>

<p>A new configuration variable,
&quot;d_printf_format_null&quot;, has been added, to see if
printf-like formats are allowed to be NULL.</p>

<p>Help &quot;Configure -h&quot; has been extended with the
most used option.</p>

<p>Much less Whoa there messages.</p>

<p>64bit systems Better detection of 64bit(only) systems,
and setting all the (library) paths accordingly.</p>

<p>Ports Perl has been reported to work on MidnightBSD.</p>

<p>Support for Cray XT4 Catamount/Qk has been added.</p>

<p>Vendor patches have been merged for RedHat and
GenToo.</p>

<p>Selected Bug Fixes PerlIO::scalar will now prevent
writing to read-only scalars. Moreover, seek() is now
supported with PerlIO::scalar-based filehandles, the
underlying string being zero-filled as needed. (Rafael,
Jarkko Hietaniemi)</p>

<p>study() never worked for UTF-8 strings, but could lead
to false results. Its now a no-op on UTF-8 data. (Yves
Orton)</p>

<p>The signals SIGILL, SIGBUS and SIGSEGV are now always
delivered in an &quot;unsafe&quot; manner (contrary to other
signals, that are deferred until the perl interpreter
reaches a reasonably stable state; see &quot;Deferred
Signals (Safe Signals)&quot; in perlipc). (Rafael)</p>

<p>When a module or a file is loaded through an @INC-hook,
and when this hook has set a filename entry in %INC,
__FILE__ is now set for this module accordingly to the
contents of that %INC entry. (Rafael)</p>

<p>The &quot;-w&quot; and &quot;-t&quot; switches can now
be used together without messing up what categories of
warnings are activated or not. (Rafael)</p>

<p>Duping a filehandle which has the &quot;:utf8&quot;
PerlIO layer set will now properly carry that layer on the
duped filehandle. (Rafael)</p>

<p>Localizing an hash element whose key was given as a
variable didnt work correctly if the variable was changed
while the local() was in effect (as in &quot;local $h{$x};
++$x&quot;). (Bo Lindbergh)</p>

<p>New or Changed Diagnostics Deprecations Two deprecation
warnings have been added: (Rafael)</p>

<p>Opening dirhandle %s also as a file Opening filehandle
%s also as a directory</p>

<p>Changed Internals The anonymous hash and array
constructors now take 1 op in the optree instead of 3, now
that pp_anonhash and pp_anonlist return a reference to an
hash/array when the op is flagged with OPf_SPECIAL (Nicholas
Clark).</p>

<p>Reporting Bugs If you find what you think is a bug, you
might check the articles recently posted to the
comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
http://rt.perl.org/rt3/ . There may also be information at
http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.</p>

<p>If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run
the perlbug program included with your release. Be sure to
trim your bug down to a tiny but sufficient test case. Your
bug report, along with the output of &quot;perl -V&quot;,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the
Perl porting team.</p>
