<p>PTHREAD_ATTR_SETSTACK(3) Linux Programmer s Manual
PTHREAD_ATTR_SETSTACK(3)</p>

<p>NAME pthread_attr_setstack, pthread_attr_getstack -
set/get stack attributes in thread attributes object</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;</p>

<p>int pthread_attr_setstack(pthread_attr_t *attr, void
*stackaddr, size_t stacksize); int
pthread_attr_getstack(pthread_attr_t *attr, void
**stackaddr, size_t *stacksize);</p>

<p>Compile and link with -pthread.</p>

<p>Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
feature_test_macros(7)):</p>

<p>pthread_attr_getstack(), pthread_attr_setstack():
_POSIX_C_SOURCE &gt;= 200112L || _XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;= 600</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pthread_attr_setstack() function sets
the stack address and stack size attributes of the thread
attributes object referred to by attr to the values
specified in stackaddr and stacksize, respectively. These
attributes specify the location and size of the stack that
should be used by a thread that is created using the thread
attributes object attr.</p>

<p>stackaddr should point to the lowest addressable byte of
a buffer of stacksize bytes that was allocated by the
caller. The pages of the allocated buffer should be both
readable and writable.</p>

<p>The pthread_attr_getstack() function returns the stack
address and stack size attributes of the thread attributes
object referred to by attr in the buffers pointed to by
stackaddr and stacksize, respec- tively.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, these functions return 0; on
error, they return a non-zero error number.</p>

<p>ERRORS pthread_attr_setstacksize() can fail with the
following error:</p>

<p>EINVAL stackaddr is less than PTHREAD_STACK_MIN (16384)
bytes. On some systems, this error may also occur if
stackaddr or stack- addr + stacksize is not suitably
aligned.</p>

<p>POSIX.1-2001 also documents an EACCES error if the stack
area described by stackaddr and stacksize is not both
readable and writable by the caller.</p>

<p>VERSIONS These functions are provided by glibc since
version 2.2.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>NOTES These functions are provided for applications that
must ensure that a thread s stack is placed in a particular
location. For most applica- tions, this is not necessary,
and the use of these functions should be avoided. (Use
pthread_attr_setstacksize(3) if an application simply
requires a stack size other than the default.)</p>

<p>When an application employs pthread_attr_setstack(), it
takes over the responsibility of allocating the stack. Any
guard size value that was set using
pthread_attr_setguardsize(3) is ignored. If deemed neces-
sary, it is the applications responsibility to allocate a
guard area (one or more pages protected against reading and
writing) to handle the possibility of stack overflow.</p>

<p>The address specified in stackaddr should be suitably
aligned: for full portability, align it on a page boundary
(sysconf(_SC_PAGESIZE)). posix_memalign(3) may be useful for
allocation. Probably, stacksize should also be a multiple of
the system page size.</p>

<p>If attr is used to create multiple threads, then the
caller must change the stack address attribute between calls
to pthread_create(3); other- wise, the threads will attempt
to use the same memory area for their stacks, and chaos will
ensue.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE See pthread_attr_init(3).</p>
