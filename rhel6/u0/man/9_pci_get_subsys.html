<p>NAME pci_get_subsys - begin or continue searching for a
PCI device by vendor/subvendor/device/subdevice id</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS struct pci_dev * pci_get_subsys(unsigned int
vendor, unsigned int device, unsigned int ss_vendor,
unsigned int ss_device, struct pci_dev * from);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS vendor PCI vendor id to match, or PCI_ANY_ID
to match all vendor ids</p>

<p>device PCI device id to match, or PCI_ANY_ID to match
all device ids</p>

<p>ss_vendor PCI subsystem vendor id to match, or
PCI_ANY_ID to match all vendor ids</p>

<p>ss_device PCI subsystem device id to match, or
PCI_ANY_ID to match all device ids</p>

<p>from Previous PCI device found in search, or NULL for
new search.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Iterates through the list of known PCI
devices. If a PCI device is found with a matching vendor,
device, ss_vendor and ss_device, a pointer to its device
structure is returned, and the reference count to the device
is incremented. Otherwise, NULL is returned. A new search is
initiated by passing NULL as the from argument. Otherwise if
from is not NULL, searches continue from next device on the
global list. The reference count for from is always
decremented if it is not NULL.</p>
