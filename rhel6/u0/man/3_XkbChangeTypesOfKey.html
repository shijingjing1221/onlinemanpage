<p>XkbChangeTypesOfKey(3) XKB FUNCTIONS
XkbChangeTypesOfKey(3)</p>

<p>NAME XkbChangeTypesOfKey - Change the number of groups
and the types bound to a key</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS Status XkbChangeTypesOfKey (XkbDescPtr xkb, int
key, int n_groups, unsigned int groups, int *new_types_in,
XkbMapChangesPtr p_changes);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS - xkb keyboard description to be changed</p>

<p>- key keycode for key of interest</p>

<p>- n_groups new number of groups for key</p>

<p>- groups mask indicating groups to change</p>

<p>- new_types_in indices for new groups specified in
groups</p>

<p>- p_changes notes changes made to xkb</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION XkbChangeTypesOfKey reallocates the symbols
and actions bound to the key, if necessary, and initializes
any new symbols or actions to NoSym- bol or NoAction, as
appropriate. If the p_changes parameter is not NULL,
XkbChangeTypesOfKey adds the XkbKeySymsMask to the changes
field of p_changes and modifies the first_key_sym and
num_key_syms fields of p_changes to include the key that was
changed. See STRUCTURE for more information on the
XkbMapChangesPtr structure. If successful,
XkbChangeTypesOfKey returns Success.</p>

<p>The n_groups parameter specifies the new number of
groups for the key. The groups parameter is a mask
specifying the groups for which new types are supplied and
is a bitwise inclusive OR of the following masks:
XkbGroup1Mask, XkbGroup2Mask, XkbGroup3Mask, and
XkbGroup4Mask.</p>

<p>The new_types_in parameter is an integer array of length
n_groups. Each entry represents the type to use for the
associated group and is an index into xkb-&gt;map-&gt;types.
The new_types_in array is indexed by group index; if
n_groups is four and groups only has Group1Mask and
Group3Mask set, new_types_in looks like this:</p>

<p>new_types_in[0] = type for Group1 new_types_in[1] =
ignored new_types_in[2] = type for Group3 new_types_in[3] =
ignored</p>

<p>For convenience, Xkb provides the following constants to
use as indices to the groups:</p>

<p>Table 1 Group Index Constants
------------------------------ Constant Name Value
------------------------------ XkbGroup1Index 0</p>

<p>XkbGroup2Index 1 XkbGroup3Index 2 XkbGroup4Index 3</p>

<p>If the Xkb extension has not been properly initialized,
XkbChangeType- sOfKey returns BadAccess. If the xkb
parameter it not valid (that is, it is NULL or it does not
contain a valid client map), XkbChangeType- sOfKey returns
BadMatch. If the key is not a valid keycode, n_groups is
greater than XkbNumKbdGroups, or the groups mask does not
contain any of the valid group mask bits,
XkbChangeTypesOfKey returns BadValue. If it is necessary to
resize the key symbols or key actions arrays and any
allocation errors occur, XkbChangeTypesOfKey returns
BadAlloc.</p>

<p>STRUCTURES Use the XkbMapChangesRec structure to
identify and track partial modi- fications to the mapping
components and to reduce the amount of traffic between the
server and clients.</p>

<p>typedef struct _XkbMapChanges { unsigned short changed;
/ identifies valid components in structure */ KeyCode
min_key_code; / lowest numbered keycode for device */
KeyCode max_key_code; / highest numbered keycode for device
*/ unsigned char first_type; / index of first key type
modified */ unsigned char num_types; / # types modified */
KeyCode first_key_sym; / first key whose key_sym_map changed
*/ unsigned char num_key_syms; / # key_sym_map entries
changed */ KeyCode first_key_act; / first key whose key_acts
entry changed */ unsigned char num_key_acts; / # key_acts

first_modmap_key; / first key whose modmap entry changed */

KeyCode first_vmodmap_key; / first key whose vmodmap changed

<p>DIAGNOSTICS BadAccess The Xkb extension has not been
properly initialized</p>

<p>BadAlloc Unable to allocate storage</p>

<p>BadMatch A compatible version of Xkb was not available
in the server or an argument has correct type and range, but
is otherwise invalid</p>

<p>BadValue An argument is out of range</p>
