<p>REALPATH(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual REALPATH(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME realpath - resolve a pathname</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</p>

<p>char *realpath(const char *restrict file_name, char
*restrict resolved_name);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The realpath() function shall derive, from
the pathname pointed to by file_name, an absolute pathname
that names the same file, whose resolu- tion does not
involve,., or symbolic links. The generated path- name shall
be stored as a null-terminated string, up to a maximum of
{PATH_MAX} bytes, in the buffer pointed to by
resolved_name.</p>

<p>If resolved_name is a null pointer, the behavior of
realpath() is implementation-defined.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, realpath()
shall return a pointer to the resolved name. Otherwise,
realpath() shall return a null pointer and set errno to
indicate the error, and the contents of the buffer pointed
to by resolved_name are undefined.</p>

<p>ERRORS The realpath() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EACCES Read or search permission was denied for a
component of file_name.</p>

<p>EINVAL The file_name argument is a null pointer.</p>

<p>EIO An error occurred while reading from the file
system.</p>

<p>ELOOP A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during
resolution of the path argument.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG The length of the file_name argument
exceeds {PATH_MAX} or a pathname component is longer than
{NAME_MAX}.</p>

<p>ENOENT A component of file_name does not name an
existing file or file_name points to an empty string.</p>

<p>ENOTDIR A component of the path prefix is not a
directory.</p>

<p>The realpath() function may fail if:</p>

<p>ELOOP More than {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic links were
encountered during resolution of the path argument.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG Pathname resolution of a symbolic link
produced an intermediate result whose length exceeds
{PATH_MAX}.</p>

<p>ENOMEM Insufficient storage space is available.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Generating an Absolute Pathname The following
example generates an absolute pathname for the file iden-
tified by the symlinkpath argument. The generated pathname
is stored in the actualpath array.</p>

<p>#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt; ... char *symlinkpath =
&quot;/tmp/symlink/file&quot;; char actualpath [PATH_MAX+1];
char *ptr;</p>

<p>ptr = realpath(symlinkpath, actualpath);</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE Since the maximum pathname length is arbitrary
unless {PATH_MAX} is defined, an application generally
cannot supply a resolved_name buffer with size
{{PATH_MAX}+1}.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS In the future, passing a null pointer
to realpath() for the resolved_name argument may be defined
to have realpath() allocate space for the generated
pathname.</p>
