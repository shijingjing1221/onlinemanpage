<p>PARPORT_YIELD(9) Parallel Port Devices
PARPORT_YIELD(9)</p>

<p>NAME parport_yield - relinquish a parallel port
temporarily</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS int parport_yield(struct pardevice * dev);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS dev a device on the parallel port</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This function relinquishes the port if it
would be helpful to other drivers to do so. Afterwards it
tries to reclaim the port using parport_claim, and the
return value is the same as for parport_claim. If it fails,
the port is left unclaimed and it is the driver&acute;s
responsibility to reclaim the port.</p>

<p>The parport_yield and parport_yield_blocking functions
are for marking points in the driver at which other drivers
may claim the port and use their devices. Yielding the port
is similar to releasing it and reclaiming it, but is more
efficient because no action is taken if there are no other
devices needing the port. In fact, nothing is done even if
there are other devices waiting but the current device is
still within its timeslice. The default timeslice is half a
second, but it can be adjusted via the /proc interface.</p>
