<p>NAME xml_split - cut a big XML file into smaller
chunks</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION &quot;xml_split&quot; takes a (presumably
big) XML file and split it in several smaller files. The
memory used is the memory needed for the biggest chunk (ie
memory is reused for each new chunk).</p>

<p>It can split at a given level in the tree (the default,
splits children of the root), or on a condition (using the
subset of XPath understood by XML::Twig, so
&quot;section&quot; or &quot;/doc/section&quot;).</p>

<p>Each generated file is replaced by a processing
instruction that will allow &quot;xml_merge&quot; to rebuild
the original document. The processing instruction format is
&quot;&lt;?merge subdocs=[01] :&lt;filename&gt;
?&gt;&quot;</p>

<p>File names are &lt;file&gt;-&lt;nb&gt;.xml, with
&lt;file&gt;-00.xml holding the main document.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -l &lt;level&gt; level to cut at: 1 generates a
file for each child of the root, 2 for each grand child</p>

<p>defaults to 1</p>

<p>-c &lt;condition&gt; generate a file for each element
that passes the condition</p>

<p>xml_split -c &lt;section&gt; will put each
&quot;section&quot; element in its own file (nested sections
are handled too)</p>

<p>Note that at the moment this option is a lot slower than
using &quot;-l&quot;</p>

<p>-s &lt;size&gt; generates files of (approximately)
&lt;size&gt;. The content of each file is enclosed in a new
element (&quot;xml_split::root&quot;), so its well- formed
XML. The size can be given in bytes, Kb, Mb or Gb.</p>

<p>-g &lt;nb&gt; groups &lt;nb&gt; elements in a single
file. The content of each file is enclosed in a new element
(&quot;xml_split::root&quot;), so it s well-formed XML.</p>

<p>-b &lt;name&gt; base name for the output, files will be
named &lt;base&gt;-&lt;nb&gt;&lt;.ext&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;nb&gt; is a sequence number, see below
&quot;--nb_digits&quot; &lt;ext&gt; is an extension, see
below &quot;--extension&quot;</p>

<p>defaults to the original file name (if available) or
&quot;out&quot; (if input comes from the standard input)</p>

<p>-n &lt;nb&gt; number of digits in the sequence number
for each file</p>

<p>if more digits than &lt;nb&gt; are needed, then they are
used: if &quot;--nb_digits 2&quot; is used and 112 files are
generated they will be named &quot;&lt;file&gt;-01.xml&quot;
to &quot;&lt;file&gt;-112.xml&quot;</p>

<p>defaults to 2</p>

<p>-e &lt;ext&gt; extension to use for generated files</p>

<p>defaults to the original file extension or
&quot;.xml&quot;</p>

<p>-i use XInclude elements instead of Processing
Instructions to mark where sub files need to be included</p>

<p>-v verbose output</p>

<p>Note that this option can slow down processing
considerably (by an order of magnitude) when generating lots
of small documents</p>

<p>-V outputs version and exit</p>

<p>-h short help</p>

<p>-m man (requires pod2text to be in the path)</p>

<p>EXAMPLES xml_split foo.xml # split at level 1 xml_split
-l 2 foo.xml # split at level 2 xml_split -c section foo.xml
# a file is generated for each section element # nested
sections are split properly</p>

<p>SEE ALSO XML::Twig, xml_merge</p>

<p>TODO optimize the code any idea welcome! I have already
implemented most of what I thought would improve
performances.</p>

<p>provide other methods that PIs to keep merge information
XInclude is a good candidate (alpha support added in
0.04).</p>

<p>using entities, which would seem the natural way to do
it, doesnt work, as they make it impossible to have both the
main document and the sub docs to be well-formed if the sub
docs include sub-sub docs (you cant have entity declarations
in an entity)</p>
