<p>LOADKEYS(1) LOADKEYS(1)</p>

<p>NAME loadkeys - load keyboard translation tables</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS loadkeys [ -b --bkeymap ] [ -c --clearcompose ]
[ -C _ &lt;cons1 cons2 ...&gt;_ | --console=cons1,cons2,...
] [ -d --default ] [ -h --help ] [ -m --mktable ] [ -q
--quiet ] [ -s --clearstrings ] [ -v --verbose ] [
filename... ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The program loadkeys reads the file or files
specified by filename.... Its main purpose is to load the
kernel keymap for the console. The affected console device
or devices can be specified using the -C (or --console )
option. This option supports a list of device names</p>

<p>RESET TO DEFAULT If the -d (or --default ) option is
given, loadkeys loads a default keymap, probably the file
defkeymap.map either in /lib/kbd/keymaps or in
/usr/src/linux/drivers/char. (Probably the former was
user-defined, while the latter is a qwerty keyboard map for
PCs - maybe not what was desired.) Sometimes, with a strange
keymap loaded (with the minus on some obscure unknown
modifier combination) it is easier to type load- keys
defkeymap.</p>

<p>LOAD KERNEL KEYMAP The main function of loadkeys is to
load or modify the keyboard drivers translation tables. When
specifying the file names, standard input can be denoted by
dash (-). If no file is specified, the data is read from the
standard input.</p>

<p>For many countries and keyboard types appropriate
keymaps are available already, and a command like loadkeys
uk might do what you want. On the other hand, it is easy to
construct ones own keymap. The user has to tell what symbols
belong to each key. She can find the keycode for a key by
use of showkey(1), while the keymap format is given in
keymaps(5) and can also be seen from the output of
dumpkeys(1).</p>

<p>LOAD KERNEL ACCENT TABLE If the input file does not
contain any compose key definitions, the kernel accent table
is left unchanged, unless the -c (or --clearcompose ) option
is given, in which case the kernel accent table is emptied.
If the input file does contain compose key definitions, then
all old definitions are removed, and replaced by the
specified new entries. The kernel accent table is a sequence
of (by default 68) entries describing how dead diacritical
signs and compose keys behave. For example, a line</p>

<p>compose , c to ccedilla</p>

<p>means that &lt;ComposeKey&gt;&lt;,&gt;&lt;c&gt; must be
combined to &lt;ccedilla&gt;. The cur- rent content of this
table can be see using dumpkeys --compose-only.</p>

<p>LOAD KERNEL STRING TABLE The option -s (or
--clearstrings ) clears the kernel string table. If this
option is not given, loadkeys will only add or replace
strings, not remove them. (Thus, the option -s is required
to reach a well- defined state.) The kernel string table is
a sequence of strings with names like F31. One can make
function key F5 (on an ordinary PC key- board) produce the
text Hello! , and Shift+F5 Goodbye! using lines</p>

<p>keycode 63 = F70 F71 string F70 = &quot;Hello!&quot;
string F71 = &quot;Goodbye!&quot;</p>

<p>in the keymap. The default bindings for the function
keys are certain escape sequences mostly inspired by the
VT100 terminal.</p>

<p>CREATE KERNEL SOURCE TABLE If the -m (or --mktable )
option is given loadkeys prints to the stan- dard output a
file that may be used as /usr/src/linux/drivers/char-
/defkeymap.c, specifying the default key bindings for a
kernel (and does not modify the current keymap).</p>

<p>CREATE BINARY KEYMAP If the -b (or --bkeymap ) option is
given loadkeys prints to the stan- dard output a file that
may be used as a binary keymap as expected by Busybox
loadkmap command (and does not modify the current
keymap).</p>

<p>OTHER OPTIONS -h --help loadkeys prints its version
number and a short usage message to the programs standard
error output and exits.</p>

<p>-q --quiet loadkeys suppresses all normal output.</p>

<p>WARNING Note that anyone having read access to
/dev/console can run loadkeys and thus change the keyboard
layout, possibly making it unusable. Note that the keyboard
translation table is common for all the virtual con- soles,
so any changes to the keyboard bindings affect all the
virtual consoles simultaneously.</p>

<p>Note that because the changes affect all the virtual
consoles, they also outlive your session. This means that
even at the login prompt the key bindings may not be what
the user expects.</p>

<p>FILES /lib/kbd/keymaps default directory for keymaps</p>

<p>/usr/src/linux/drivers/char/defkeymap.map default kernel
keymap</p>
