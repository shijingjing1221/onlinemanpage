<p>AMSTEX(1) AMSTEX(1)</p>

<p>NAME amstex - structured text formatting and
typesetting</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS amstex [ first line ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page is not meant to be
exhaustive. The complete documen- tation for this version of
TeX can be found in the info file or manual Web2C: A TeX
implementation.</p>

<p>The AmSTeX language is described in the book The Joy of
TeX for nroff. AmSTeX is a TeX macro package, not a
modification to the TeX source program, so all the
capabilities described in tex(1) are present.</p>

<p>The AmSTeX macros encourage writers to think about the
content of their documents, rather than the form. The ideal,
not always realized, is to have no formatting commands (like
switch to italic or skip 2 picas) in the document at all;
instead, everything is done by spe- cific markup
instructions: emphasize, start a section.</p>

<p>AmSTeX is the official typesetting system of the
American Mathematical Society, and nearly all of its
publications are typeset using AmSTeX. The online version of
AMS Math Reviews uses AmSTeX input syntax for display of
mathematical material. AMS authors can provide editors with
computer-readable AmSTeX files.</p>

<p>For authors more familiar with LaTeX, an AMS-supported
package called amsmath.sty is is available.</p>
