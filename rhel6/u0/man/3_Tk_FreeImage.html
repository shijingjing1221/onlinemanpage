<p>DESCRIPTION These procedures are invoked by widgets that
wish to display images. Tk_GetImage is invoked by a widget
when it first decides to display an image. name gives the
name of the desired image and tkwin identifies the window
where the image will be displayed. Tk_GetImage looks up the
image in the table of existing images and returns a token
for a new instance of the image. If the image does not exist
then Tk_GetImage returns NULL and leaves an error message in
interp-&gt;result.</p>

<p>When a widget wishes to actually display an image it
must call Tk_RedrawImage, identifying the image (image), a
region within the image to redisplay (imageX, imageY, width,
and height), and a place to display the image (drawable,
drawableX, and drawableY). Tk will then invoke the
appropriate image manager, which will display the requested
portion of the image before returning.</p>

<p>A widget can find out the dimensions of an image by
calling Tk_Size- OfImage: the width and height will be
stored in the locations given by widthPtr and heightPtr,
respectively.</p>

<p>When a widget is finished with an image (e.g., the
widget is being deleted or it is going to use a different
image instead of the current one), it must call Tk_FreeImage
to release the image instance. The widget should never again
use the image token after passing it to Tk_FreeImage. There
must be exactly one call to Tk_FreeImage for each call to
Tk_GetImage.</p>

<p>If the contents or size of an image changes, then any
widgets using the image will need to find out about the
changes so that they can redis- play themselves. The
changeProc and clientData arguments to Tk_GetIm- age are
used for this purpose. changeProc will be called by Tk when-
ever a change occurs in the image; it must match the
following proto- type: typedef void Tk_ImageChangedProc(
ClientData clientData, int x, int y, int width, int height,
int imageWidth, int imageHeight); The clientData argument to
changeProc is the same as the clientData argument to
Tk_GetImage. It is usually a pointer to the widget record
for the widget or some other data structure managed by the
widget. The arguments x, y, width, and height identify a
region within the image that must be redisplayed; they are
specified in pixels measured from the upper-left corner of
the image. The arguments imageWidth and imageHeight give the
images (new) size.</p>
