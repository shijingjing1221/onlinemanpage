<p>CONMAN(1) ConMan: The Console Manager CONMAN(1)</p>

<p>NAME conman - ConMan client</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS conman [OPTION]... [CONSOLE]...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION conman is a program for connecting to remote
consoles being managed by conmand. Console names can be
separated by spaces and/or commas. Globbing is used by
default to match console names against the configu- ration,
but regular expression matching can be enabled with the -r
option.</p>

<p>conman supports three modes of console access: monitor
(read-only), interactive (read-write), and broadcast
(write-only). If neither the -m (monitor) nor -b (broadcast)
options are specified, the console session is opened in
interactive mode.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -b Broadcast to multiple consoles (write-only).
Data sent by the client will be copied to all specified
consoles in parallel, but console output will not be sent
back to the client. This option can be used in conjunction
with -f or -j.</p>

<p>-d destination Specify the location of the conmand
daemon, overriding the default [127.0.0.1:7890]. This
location may contain a hostname or IP address, and be
optionally followed by a colon and port number.</p>

<p>-e character Specify the client escape character,
overriding the default [&amp;].</p>

<p>-f Specify that write-access to the console should be
&quot;forced&quot;, thereby stealing the console away from
existing clients having write privileges. The original
clients are informed by conmand of who perpetrated the theft
as their connections are termi- nated.</p>

<p>-F file Read console names/patterns from file. Only one
console name may be specified per line. Leading and trailing
whitespace, blank lines, and comments (i.e., lines beginning
with a #) are ignored.</p>

<p>-h Display a summary of the command-line options.</p>

<p>-j Specify that write-access to the console should be
&quot;joined&quot;, thereby sharing the console with
existing clients having write privileges. The original
clients are informed by conmand that a new client has been
granted write privileges.</p>

<p>-l file Log console session output to file.</p>

<p>-L Display license information.</p>

<p>-m Monitor a console (read-only).</p>

<p>-q Query conmand for consoles matching the specified
names/pat- terns. Output from this query can be saved to
file for use with the -F option.</p>

<p>-Q Enable quiet-mode, suppressing informational
messages. This mode can be toggled within a console session
via the &amp;Q escape.</p>

<p>-r Match console names via regular expressions instead
of globbing.</p>

<p>-v Enable verbose mode.</p>

<p>-V Display version information.</p>

<p>ESCAPE CHARACTERS The following escapes are supported
and assume the default escape char- acter [&amp;]:</p>

<p>&amp;? Display a list of currently available
escapes.</p>

<p>&amp;. Terminate the connection.</p>

<p>&amp;&amp; Send a single escape character.</p>

<p>&amp;B Send a &quot;serial-break&quot; to the remote
console.</p>

<p>&amp;E Toggle echoing of client input.</p>

<p>&amp;F Switch from read-only to read-write via a
&quot;force&quot;.</p>

<p>&amp;I Display information about the connection.</p>

<p>&amp;J Switch from read-only to read-write via a
&quot;join&quot;.</p>

<p>&amp;L Replay up the the last 4KB of console output.
This escape requires the console device to have logging
enabled in the con- mand configuration.</p>

<p>&amp;M Switch from read-write to read-only.</p>

<p>&amp;Q Toggle quiet-mode to display/suppress
informational messages.</p>

<p>&amp;R Reset the node associated with this console. This
escape requires a &quot;resetcmd&quot; to be specified in
the conmand configura- tion.</p>

<p>&amp;Z Suspend the client.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT The following environment variables override
the default settings.</p>

<p>CONMAN_HOST Specifies the hostname or IP address at
which to contact con- mand, but may be overridden by the -d
command-line option. A port number separated by a colon may
follow the hostname (i.e., host:port), although the
CONMAN_PORT environment variable takes precedence. If not
set, the default host [127.0.0.1] will be used.</p>

<p>CONMAN_PORT Specifies the port on which to contact
conmand, but may be over- ridden by the -d command-line
option. If not set, the default port [7890] will be
used.</p>

<p>CONMAN_ESCAPE The first character of this variable
specifies the escape char- acter, but may be overridden by
the -e command-line option. If not set, the default escape
character [&amp;] will be used.</p>

<p>SECURITY The client/server communications are not yet
encrypted.</p>
