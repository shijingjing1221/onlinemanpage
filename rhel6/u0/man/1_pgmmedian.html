<p>NAME pgmmedian - apply a median filter to a PGM file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pgmmedian</p>

<p>[-width=n]</p>

<p>[-height=n]</p>

<p>[-type=median_type]</p>

<p>[-cutoff=int]</p>

<p>[pnmfile]</p>

<p>Minimum unique abbreviation of option is acceptable. You
may use dou- ble hyphens instead of single hyphen to denote
options. You may use white space in place of the equals sign
to separate an option name from its value.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pgmmedian applies a median filter to a PGM image, using
either the his- togram sort or select kth value method to
determine the median.</p>

<p>See the -type and -cutoff options for information on how
pgmmedian chooses between the two methods.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -cutoff int This option provides the cutoff
value that pgmmedian uses to decide between using the
histogram sort or select kth value method to find the
median.</p>

<p>If (maxval / ((width * height) - 1)), where maxval is
the maxval of the image and width and height are the
dimensions of the mask, is less than the cutoff value,
pgmmedian uses histogram sort. Otherwise, it uses kth
value.</p>

<p>If expression is less than the cutoff, pgmmedian uses
the his- togram sort. Otherwise it uses the select kth value
method.</p>

<p>This option has no effect if you specify -type.</p>

<p>The default is 250</p>

<p>-width=n Width of the median mask to apply.</p>

<p>Default is 3.</p>

<p>-height=n Height of the median mask to apply.</p>

<p>Default is 3.</p>

<p>-type median_type This option selects which method to
use to find median regard- less of cutoff value. Choices are
histogram_sort and select.</p>

<p>By default, pgmmedian decides which method to use as
described under the -cutoff option.</p>
