<p>NAME sessreg - manage utmp/wtmp entries for non-init
clients</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sessreg [-w wtmp-file] [-u utmp-file] [-L
lastlog-file] [-l line-name] [-h host-name] [-s slot-number]
[-x Xservers-file] [-t ttys-file] [-a] [-d] user-name</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Sessreg is a simple program for managing
utmp/wtmp and lastlog entries for xdm sessions.</p>

<p>System V has a better interface to utmp than BSD; it
dynamically allo- cates entries in the file, instead of
writing them at fixed positions indexed by position in
/etc/ttys.</p>

<p>To manage BSD-style utmp files, sessreg has two
strategies. In con- junction with xdm, the -x option counts
the number of lines in /etc/ttys and then adds to that the
number of the line in the Xservers file which specifies the
display. The display name must be specified as the
&quot;line-name&quot; using the -l option. This sum is used
as the &quot;slot- number&quot; in the utmp file that this
entry will be written at. In the more general case, the -s
option specifies the slot-number directly. If for some
strange reason your system uses a file other than /etc/ttys
to manage init, the -t option can direct sessreg to look
elsewhere for a count of terminal sessions.</p>

<p>Conversely, System V managers will not ever need to use
these options (-x, -s and -t). To make the program easier to
document and explain, sessreg accepts the BSD-specific flags
in the System V environment and ignores them.</p>

<p>BSD and Linux also have a host-name field in the utmp
file which doesnt exist in System V. This option is also
ignored by the System V version of sessreg.</p>

<p>USAGE In Xstartup, place a call like:</p>

<p>sessreg -a -l $DISPLAY -x /etc/X11/xdm/Xservers
$USER</p>

<p>and in Xreset:</p>

<p>sessreg -d -l $DISPLAY -x /etc/X11/xdm/Xservers
$USER</p>

<p>OPTIONS -w wtmp-file This specifies an alternate wtmp
file, instead of /var/log/wtmp. The special name
&quot;none&quot; disables writing records to the wtmp
file.</p>

<p>-u utmp-file This specifies an alternate utmp file,
instead of /var/run/utmp. The special name &quot;none&quot;
disables writing records to the utmp file.</p>

<p>-L lastlog-file This specifies an alternate lastlog
file, instead of /var/log/lastlog, if the platform supports
lastlog files. The special name &quot;none&quot; disables
writing records to the lastlog file.</p>

<p>-l line-name This describes the &quot;line&quot; name of
the entry. For terminal ses- sions, this is the final
pathname segment of the terminal device filename (e.g.
ttyd0). For X sessions, it should probably be the local
display name given to the users session (e.g. :0). If none
is specified, the terminal name will be determined with
ttyname(3) and stripped of leading components.</p>

<p>-h host-name This is set for BSD hosts to indicate that
the session was ini- tiated from a remote host. In typical
xdm usage, this options is not used.</p>

<p>-s slot-number Each potential session has a unique slot
number in BSD systems, most are identified by the position
of the line-name in the /etc/ttysfile. This option overrides
the default position determined with ttyslot(3). This option
is inappropriate for use with xdm, the -x option is more
useful.</p>

<p>-x Xservers-file As X sessions are one-per-display, and
each display is entered in this file, this options sets the
slot-number to be the number of lines in the ttys-file plus
the index into this file that the line-name is found.</p>

<p>-t ttys-file This specifies an alternate file which the
-x option will use to count the number of terminal sessions
on a host.</p>

<p>-a This session should be added to utmp/wtmp.</p>

<p>-d This session should be deleted from utmp/wtmp. One of
-a/-d must be specified.</p>
