<p>FILEMAP_FAULT(9) Memory Management in Linux
FILEMAP_FAULT(9)</p>

<p>NAME filemap_fault - read in file data for page fault
handling</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS int filemap_fault(struct vm_area_struct * vma,
struct vm_fault * vmf);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS vma vma in which the fault was taken</p>

<p>vmf struct vm_fault containing details of the fault</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION filemap_fault is invoked via the vma
operations vector for a mapped memory region to read in file
data during a page fault.</p>

<p>The goto&acute;s are kind of ugly, but this streamlines
the normal case of having it in the page cache, and handles
the special cases reasonably without having a lot of
duplicated code.</p>
