<p>NAME vfs_netatalk - hide .AppleDouble files from CIFS
clients</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS vfs objects = netatalk</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This VFS module is part of the samba(7)
suite.</p>

<p>The vfs_netatalk VFS module dynamically hides
.AppleDouble files, preventing spurious errors on some CIFS
clients. .AppleDouble files may be created by historic
implementations of AFP (Apple Filing Protocol) on
servers.</p>

<p>This module is stackable.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Hide .AppleDouble files on the [data]
share:</p>

<p>[data] vfs objects = netatalk</p>

<p>CAVEATS This module is largely historic and unlikely to
be of use in modern networks since current Apple systems are
able to mount CIFS shares natively.</p>

<p>VERSION This man page is correct for version 3.0.25 of
the Samba suite.</p>

<p>AUTHOR The original Samba software and related utilities
were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by
the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way
the Linux kernel is developed.</p>
