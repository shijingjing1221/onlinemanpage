<p>NAME mergecap - Merges two or more capture files into
one</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS mergecap [ -a ] [ -F &lt;file format&gt; ] [ -h
] [ -s &lt;snaplen&gt; ] [ -T &lt;encapsulation type&gt; ] [
-v ] -w &lt;outfile&gt;|- &lt;infile&gt; ...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Mergecap is a program that combines multiple
saved capture files into a single output file specified by
the -w argument. Mergecap knows how to read libpcap capture
files, including those of tcpdump, Wireshark, and other
tools that write captures in that format.</p>

<p>By default, Mergecap writes the capture file in libpcap
format, and writes all of the packets from the input capture
files to the output file.</p>

<p>Mergecap is able to detect, read and write the same
capture files that are supported by Wireshark. The input
files dont need a specific filename extension; the file
format and an optional gzip compression will be
automatically detected. Near the beginning of the
DESCRIPTION section of wireshark(1) or
&lt;http://www.wireshark.org/docs/man-pages/wireshark.html&gt;
is a detailed description of the way Wireshark handles this,
which is the same way Mergecap handles this.</p>

<p>Mergecap can write the file in several output formats.
The -F flag can be used to specify the format in which to
write the capture file, mergecap -F provides a list of the
available output formats.</p>

<p>Packets from the input files are merged in chronological
order based on each frame s timestamp, unless the -a flag is
specified. Mergecap assumes that frames within a single
capture file are already stored in chronological order. When
the -a flag is specified, packets are copied directly from
each input file to the output file, independent of each
frames timestamp.</p>

<p>The output file frame encapsulation type is set to the
type of the input files if all input files have the same
type. If not all of the input files have the same frame
encapsulation type, the output file type is set to
WTAP_ENCAP_PER_PACKET. Note that some capture file formats,
most notably libpcap, do not currently support
WTAP_ENCAP_PER_PACKET. This combination will cause the
output file creation to fail.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -a Causes the frame timestamps to be ignored,
writing all packets from the first input file followed by
all packets from the second input file. By default, when -a
is not specified, the contents of the input files are merged
in chronological order based on each frames timestamp.</p>

<p>Note: when merging, mergecap assumes that packets within
a capture file are already in chronological order.</p>

<p>-F &lt;file format&gt; Sets the file format of the
output capture file. Mergecap can write the file in several
formats; mergecap -F provides a list of the available output
formats. The default is to use the file format of the first
input file.</p>

<p>-h Prints the version and options and exits.</p>

<p>-s &lt;snaplen&gt; Sets the snapshot length to use when
writing the data. If the -s flag is used to specify a
snapshot length, frames in the input file with more captured
data than the specified snapshot length will have only the
amount of data specified by the snapshot length written to
the output file. This may be useful if the program that is
to read the output file cannot handle packets larger than a
certain size (for example, the versions of snoop in Solaris
2.5.1 and Solaris 2.6 appear to reject Ethernet frames
larger than the standard Ethernet MTU, making them incapable
of handling gigabit Ethernet captures if jumbo frames were
used).</p>

<p>-v Causes mergecap to print a number of messages while
it s working.</p>

<p>-w &lt;outfile&gt;|- Sets the output filename. If the
name is - , stdout will be used. This setting is
mandatory.</p>

<p>-T &lt;encapsulation type&gt; Sets the packet
encapsulation type of the output capture file. If the -T
flag is used to specify a frame encapsulation type, the
encapsulation type of the output capture file will be forced
to the specified type, rather than being the type
appropriate to the encapsulation type of the input capture
files.</p>

<p>Note that this merely forces the encapsulation type of
the output file to be the specified type; the packet headers
of the packets will not be translated from the encapsulation
type of the input capture file to the specified
encapsulation type (for example, it will not translate an
Ethernet capture to an FDDI capture if an Ethernet capture
is read and -T fddi is specified).</p>
