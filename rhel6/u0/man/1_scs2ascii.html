<p>NAME scs2ascii - convert IBM SCS printer data into
ASCII</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS scs2ascii</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program handles the conversion from an
SCS print stream from an AS/400 printer emulation to
something suitable for sending to lpr. It is only intended
for use with lp5250d.</p>

<p>When using host print transform with lp5250d, scs2ascii
will remove the remaining characters from the SCS print
stream to leave only the data intended for the printer.</p>
