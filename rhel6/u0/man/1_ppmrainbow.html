<p>NAME ppmrainbow - Generate a rainbow</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ppmrainbow</p>

<p>[-width=number] [-height=number] [-tmpdir=directory]
[-norepeat] [-ver- bose] color ...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>ppmrainbow generates a PPM image that fades from one
color to another to another from left to right, like a
rainbow. The colors are those you specify on the command
line, in that order. The first color is added again on the
right end of the image unless you specify the -nore- peat
option.</p>

<p>If you want a vertical or other non-horizontal rainbow,
run the output through pnmrotate or pamflip.</p>

<p>One use for such a rainbow is to compose it with another
image under an alpha mask in order to add a rainbow area to
another image. In fact, you can make rainbow-colored text by
using pbmtext, pamcomp, and ppm- rainbow.</p>

<p>pgmramp does a similar thing for grayscale images.</p>

<p>If you just want an image containing all the possible
colors (for some kind of processing; not to look at), see
pamseq.</p>

<p>OPTIONS All options can be abbreviated to their shortest
unique prefix. You may use two hyphens instead of one to
designate an option. You may use either white space or
equals signs between an option name and its value.</p>

<p>-width number The width in pixels of the output
image.</p>

<p>Default is 600.</p>

<p>-height number The height in pixels of the output
image.</p>

<p>Default is 8.</p>

<p>-norepeat</p>

<p>This option makes ppmrainbow end the rainbow with the
last color you specify. Without this option, ppmrainbow adds
the first color you specify to the right end of the rainbow
as if you had repeated it. (I dont understand the point of
this default behavior; it exists today just for backward
compatibility).</p>

<p>-tmpdir The directory specification of the directory
ppmrainbow is to use for temporary files.</p>

<p>Default is the value of the TMPDIR environment variable,
or /tmp if TMPDIR is not set.</p>

<p>-verbose Print the commands (invocations of other Netpbm
programs) that ppmrainbow uses to create the image.</p>

ppmmake(1), ppmfade(1), ppm(1).</p>

<p>AUTHOR Arjen Bax wrote ppmrainbow in June 2001 and
contributed it to the Netpbm package. Bryan Henderson wrote
this manual in July 2001.</p>
