<p>CTAGS(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual CTAGS(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME ctags - create a tags file (DEVELOPMENT,
FORTRAN)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ctags [-a][-f tagsfile] pathname ...</p>

<p>ctags -x pathname ...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The ctags utility shall be provided on
systems that support the User Portability Utilities option,
the Software Development Utilities option, and either or
both of the C-Language Development Utilities option and
FORTRAN Development Utilities option. On other systems, it
is optional.</p>

<p>The ctags utility shall write a tagsfile or an index of
objects from C- language or FORTRAN source files specified
by the pathname operands. The tagsfile shall list the
locators of language-specific objects within the source
files. A locator consists of a name, pathname, and either a
search pattern or a line number that can be used in
searching for the object definition. The objects that shall
be recognized are specified in the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
section.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The ctags utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>The following options shall be supported:</p>

<p>-a Append to tagsfile.</p>

<p>-f tagsfile Write the object locator lists into tagsfile
instead of the default file named tags in the current
directory.</p>

<p>-x Produce a list of object names, the line number, and
filename in which each is defined, as well as the text of
that line, and write this to the standard output. A tagsfile
shall not be cre- ated when -x is specified.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following pathname operands are
supported:</p>

<p>file.c Files with basenames ending with the .c suffix
shall be treated as C-language source code. Such files that
are not valid input to c99 produce unspecified results.</p>

<p>file.h Files with basenames ending with the .h suffix
shall be treated as C-language source code. Such files that
are not valid input to c99 produce unspecified results.</p>

<p>file.f Files with basenames ending with the .f suffix
shall be treated as FORTRAN-language source code. Such files
that are not valid input to fort77 produce unspecified
results.</p>

<p>The handling of other files is
implementation-defined.</p>

<p>STDIN See the INPUT FILES section.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES The input files shall be text files
containing source code in the lan- guage indicated by the
operand filename suffixes.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of ctags:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_COLLATE</p>

<p>Determine the order in which output is sorted for the -x
option. The POSIX locale determines the order in which the
tagsfile is written.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments
and input files). When processing C-language source code, if
the locale is not compatible with the C locale described by
the ISO C standard, the results are unspecified.</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT The list of object name information produced by
the -x option shall be written to standard output in the
following format:</p>

<p>&quot;%s %d %s %s&quot;, &lt;object-name&gt;,
&lt;line-number&gt;, &lt;filename&gt;, &lt;text&gt;</p>

<p>where &lt;text&gt; is the text of line
&lt;line-number&gt; of file &lt;filename&gt;.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES When the -x option is not specified, the
format of the output file shall be:</p>

<p>&quot;%t%t/%sn&quot;, &lt;identifier&gt;,
&lt;filename&gt;, &lt;pattern&gt;</p>

<p>where &lt;pattern&gt; is a search pattern that could be
used by an editor to find the defining instance of
&lt;identifier&gt; in &lt;filename&gt; (where defin- ing
instance is indicated by the declarations listed in the
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION).</p>

<p>An optional circumflex (^) can be added as a prefix to
&lt;pattern&gt;, and an optional dollar sign can be appended
to &lt;pattern&gt; to indicate that the pattern is anchored
to the beginning (end) of a line of text. Any slash or
backslash characters in &lt;pattern&gt; shall be preceded by
a backslash character. The anchoring circumflex, dollar
sign, and escap- ing backslash characters shall not be
considered part of the search pattern. All other characters
in the search pattern shall be considered literal
characters.</p>

<p>An alternative format is:</p>

<p>&quot;%t%t?%sn&quot;, &lt;identifier&gt;,
&lt;filename&gt;, &lt;pattern&gt;</p>

<p>which is identical to the first format except that
slashes in &lt;pattern&gt; shall not be preceded by escaping
backslash characters, and question mark characters in
&lt;pattern&gt; shall be preceded by backslash
characters.</p>

<p>A second alternative format is:</p>

<p>&quot;%t%t%n&quot;, &lt;identifier&gt;,
&lt;filename&gt;, &lt;lineno&gt;</p>

<p>where &lt;lineno&gt; is a decimal line number that could
be used by an editor to find &lt;identifier&gt; in
&lt;filename&gt;.</p>

<p>Neither alternative format shall be produced by ctags
when it is used as described by IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, but
the standard utilities that process tags files shall be able
to process those formats as well as the first format.</p>

<p>In any of these formats, the file shall be sorted by
identifier, based on the collation sequence in the POSIX
locale.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION If the operand identifies
C-language source, the ctags utility shall attempt to
produce an output line for each of the following
objects:</p>

<p>* Function definitions</p>

<p>* Type definitions</p>

<p>* Macros with arguments</p>

<p>It may also produce output for any of the following
objects:</p>

<p>* Function prototypes</p>

<p>* Structures</p>

<p>* Unions</p>

<p>* Global variable definitions</p>

<p>* Enumeration types</p>

<p>* Macros without arguments</p>

<p>* #define statements</p>

<p>* #line statements</p>

<p>Any #if and #ifdef statements shall produce no output.
The tag main is treated specially in C programs. The tag
formed shall be created by prefixing M to the name of the
file, with the trailing .c, and leading pathname components
(if any) removed.</p>

<p>On systems that do not support the C-Language
Development Utilities option, ctags produces unspecified
results for C-language source code files. It should write to
standard error a message identifying this condition and
cause a non-zero exit status to be produced.</p>

<p>If the operand identifies FORTRAN source, the ctags
utility shall pro- duce an output line for each function
definition. It may also produce output for any of the
following objects:</p>

<p>* Subroutine definitions</p>

<p>* COMMON statements</p>

<p>* PARAMETER statements</p>

<p>* DATA and BLOCK DATA statements</p>

<p>* Statement numbers</p>

<p>On systems that do not support the FORTRAN Development
Utilities option, ctags produces unspecified results for
FORTRAN source code files. It should write to standard error
a message identifying this condition and cause a non-zero
exit status to be produced.</p>

<p>It is implementation-defined what other objects
(including duplicate identifiers) produce output.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 Successful completion.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The output with -x is meant to be a
simple index that can be written out as an off-line readable
function index. If the input files to ctags (such as .c
files) were not created using the same locale as that in
effect when ctags -x is run, results might not be as
expected.</p>

<p>The description of C-language processing says
&quot;attempts to&quot; because the C language can be
greatly confused, especially through the use of #defines,
and this utility would be of no use if the real C preproces-
sor were run to identify them. The output from ctags may be
fooled and incorrect for various constructs.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The option list was significantly reduced from
that provided by histor- ical implementations. The -F option
was omitted as redundant, since it is the default. The -B
option was omitted as being of very limited use- fulness.
The -t option was omitted since the recognition of typedefs
is now required for C source files. The -u option was
omitted because the update function was judged to be not
only inefficient, but also rarely needed.</p>

<p>An early proposal included a -w option to suppress
warning diagnostics. Since the types of such diagnostics
could not be described, the option was omitted as being not
useful.</p>

<p>The text for LC_CTYPE about compatibility with the C
locale acknowl- edges that the ISO C standard imposes
requirements on the locale used to process C source. This
could easily be a superset of that known as &quot;the C
locale&quot; by way of implementation extensions, or one of
a few alternative locales for systems supporting different
codesets. No statement is made for FORTRAN because the ANSI
X3.9-1978 standard (FOR- TRAN 77) does not (yet) define a
similar locale concept. However, a general rule in this
volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 is that any time that locales
do not match (preparing a file for one locale and process-
ing it in another), the results are suspect.</p>

<p>The collation sequence of the tags file is not affected
by LC_COLLATE because it is typically not used by human
readers, but only by programs such as vi to locate the tag
within the source files. Using the POSIX locale eliminates
some of the problems of coordinating locales between the
ctags file creator and the vi file reader.</p>

<p>Historically, the tags file has been used only by ex and
vi. However, the format of the tags file has been published
to encourage other pro- grams to use the tags in new ways.
The format allows either patterns or line numbers to find
the identifiers because the historical vi recog- nizes
either. The ctags utility does not produce the format using
line numbers because it is not useful following any source
file changes that add or delete lines. The documented search
patterns match historical practice. It should be noted that
literal leading circumflex or trail- ing dollar-sign
characters in the search pattern will only behave cor-
rectly if anchored to the beginning of the line or end of
the line by an additional circumflex or dollar-sign
character.</p>

<p>Historical implementations also understand the objects
used by the lan- guages Pascal and sometimes LISP, and they
understand the C source out- put by lex and yacc. The ctags
utility is not required to accommodate these languages,
although implementors are encouraged to do so.</p>

<p>The following historical option was not specified, as
vgrind is not included in this volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001:</p>

<p>-v If the -v flag is given, an index of the form
expected by vgrind is produced on the standard output. This
listing contains the function name, filename, and page
number (assuming 64-line pages). Since the output is sorted
into lexicographic order, it may be desired to run the
output through sort -f. Sample use:</p>

<p>ctags -v files | sort -f &gt; index vgrind -x index</p>

<p>The special treatment of the tag main makes the use of
ctags practical in directories with more than one
program.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
