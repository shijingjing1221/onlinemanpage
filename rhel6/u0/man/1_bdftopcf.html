<p>NAME bdftopcf - convert X font from Bitmap Distribution
Format to Portable Compiled Format</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS bdftopcf [ -pn ] [ -un ] [ -m ] [ -l ] [ -M ] [
-L ] [ -t ] [ -i ] [ -o outputfile ] fontfile.bdf</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Bdftopcf is a font compiler for the X server
and font server. Fonts in Portable Compiled Format can be
read by any architecture, although the file is structured to
allow one particular architecture to read them directly
without reformatting. This allows fast reading on the appro-
priate machine, but the files are still portable (but read
more slowly) on other machines.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -pn Sets the font glyph padding. Each glyph in
the font will have each scanline padded in to a multiple of
n bytes, where n is 1, 2, 4 or 8.</p>

<p>-un Sets the font scanline unit. When the font bit order
is dif- ferent from the font byte order, the scanline unit n
describes what unit of data (in bytes) are to be swapped;
the unit i can be 1, 2 or 4 bytes.</p>

<p>-m Sets the font bit order to MSB (most significant bit)
first. Bits for each glyph will be placed in this order;
i.e., the left most bit on the screen will be in the highest
valued bit in each unit.</p>

<p>-l Sets the font bit order to LSB (least significant
bit) first. The left most bit on the screen will be in the
lowest valued bit in each unit.</p>

<p>-M Sets the font byte order to MSB first. All multi-byte
data in the file (metrics, bitmaps and everything else) will
be written most significant byte first.</p>

<p>-L Sets the font byte order to LSB first. All multi-byte
data in the file (metrics, bitmaps and everything else) will
be written least significant byte first.</p>

<p>-t When this option is specified, bdftopcf will convert
fonts into &quot;terminal&quot; fonts when possible. A
terminal font has each glyph image padded to the same size;
the X server can usually render these types of fonts more
quickly.</p>

<p>-i This option inhibits the normal computation of ink
metrics. When a font has glyph images which do not fill the
bitmap image (i.e., the &quot;on&quot; pixels dont extend to
the edges of the met- rics) bdftopcf computes the actual ink
metrics and places them in the .pcf file; the -t option
inhibits this behaviour.</p>

<p>-o output-file-name By default bdftopcf writes the pcf
file to standard output; this option gives the name of a
file to be used instead.</p>
