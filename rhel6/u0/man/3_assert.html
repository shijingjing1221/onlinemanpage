<p>ASSERT(3) Linux Programmer s Manual ASSERT(3)</p>

<p>NAME assert - abort the program if assertion is
false</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;assert.h&gt;</p>

<p>void assert(scalar expression);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION If the macro NDEBUG was defined at the
moment &lt;assert.h&gt; was last included, the macro
assert() generates no code, and hence does nothing at all.
Otherwise, the macro assert() prints an error message to
stan- dard error and terminates the program by calling
abort(3) if expression is false (i.e., compares equal to
zero).</p>

<p>The purpose of this macro is to help the programmer find
bugs in his program. The message &quot;assertion failed in
file foo.c, function do_bar(), line 1287&quot; is of no help
at all to a user.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE No value is returned.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO POSIX.1-2001, C89, C99. In C89, expression
is required to be of type int and undefined behavior results
if it is not, but in C99 it may have any scalar type.</p>

<p>BUGS assert() is implemented as a macro; if the
expression tested has side- effects, program behavior will
be different depending on whether NDEBUG is defined. This
may create Heisenbugs which go away when debugging is turned
on.</p>
