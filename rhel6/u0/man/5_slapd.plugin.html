<p>SLAPD.PLUGIN(5) SLAPD.PLUGIN(5)</p>

<p>NAME slapd.plugin - plugin configuration for slapd, the
stand-alone LDAP daemon</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS /etc/openldap/slapd.conf</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The slapd.conf(5) file contains
configuration information for the slapd(8) daemon. This
configuration file is also used by the SLAPD tools
slapadd(8), slapcat(8), and slapindex(8).</p>

<p>The slapd.conf file consists of a series of global
configuration options that apply to slapd as a whole
(including all backends), fol- lowed by zero or more
database backend definitions that contain infor- mation
specific to a backend instance.</p>

<p>The general format of slapd.conf is as follows:</p>

<p># comment - these options apply to every database
&lt;global configuration options&gt; # first database
definition &amp; configuration options database &lt;backend
1 type&gt; &lt;configuration options specific to backend
1&gt; # subsequent database definitions &amp; configuration
options ...</p>

<p>If slapd is compiled with --enable-slapi, support for
plugins according to Netscapes Directory Server Plug-Ins.
Version 4 of the API is cur- rently implemented, with some
extensions from version 5.</p>

<p>Both global and database specific data may contain
plugin information. Plugins associated with a specific
database are called before global plugins. This manpage
details the slapd(8) configuration statements that affect
the loading of SLAPI plugins.</p>

<p>Arguments that should be replaced by actual text are
shown in brackets &lt;&gt;.</p>

<p>The structure of the plugin directives is</p>

<p>plugin &lt;type&gt; &lt;lib_path&gt;
&lt;init_function&gt; [&lt;arguments&gt;] Load a plugin of
the specified type for the current database.</p>

<p>The &lt;type&gt; can be one of preoperation, that is
executed before process- ing the operation for the specified
database, postoperation, that is executed after the
operation for the specified database has been pro- cessed,
extendedop, that is used when executing an extended
operation, or object. The latter is used for miscellaneous
types such as ACL, computed attribute and search filter
rewriter plugins.</p>

<p>The &lt;libpath&gt; argument specifies the path to the
plugin loadable object; if a relative path is given, the
object is looked for according to the underlying dynamic
loading package (libtools ltdl is used).</p>

<p>The &lt;init_function&gt; argument specifies what symbol
must be called when the plugin is first loaded. This
function should register the func- tions provided by the
plugin for the desired operations. It should be noted that
it is this init function, not the plugin type specified as
the first argument, that determines when and for what
operations the plugin will be invoked. The optional
&lt;arguments&gt; list is passed to the init function.</p>

<p>pluginlog &lt;file&gt; Specify an alternative path for
the plugin log file (default is /var/errors).</p>

<p>modulepath &lt;pathspec&gt; This statement sets the
module load path for dynamically load- able backends, as
described in slapd.conf(5); however, since both the
dynamically loadable backends and the SLAPI plugins use the
same underlying library (libtools ltdl) its value also
affects the plugin search path. In general the search path
is made of colon-separated paths; usually the user-defined
path is searched first; then the value of the
LTDL_LIBRARY_PATH environ- ment variable, if defined, is
used; finally, the system-specific dynamic load path is
attempted (e.g. on Linux the value of the environment
variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH). Please carefully read the
documentation of ltdl because its behavior is very platform
dependent.</p>
