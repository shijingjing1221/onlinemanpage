<p>NAME XColormapEvent - ColormapNotify event structure</p>

<p>STRUCTURES The structure for ColormapNotify events
contains:</p>

<p>typedef struct { int type; /* ColormapNotify */ unsigned
long serial; /* # of last request processed by server */
Bool send_event; /* true if this came from a SendEvent
request */ Display *display; /* Display the event was read
from */ Window window; Colormap colormap; /* colormap or
None */ Bool new; int state; /* ColormapInstalled,
ColormapUninstalled */ } XColormapEvent;</p>

<p>When you receive this event, the structure members are
set as follows.</p>

<p>The type member is set to the event type constant name
that uniquely identifies it. For example, when the X server
reports a GraphicsExpose event to a client application, it
sends an XGraphicsExposeEvent struc- ture with the type
member set to GraphicsExpose. The display member is set to a
pointer to the display the event was read on. The send_event
member is set to True if the event came from a SendEvent
protocol request. The serial member is set from the serial
number reported in the protocol but expanded from the 16-bit
least-significant bits to a full 32-bit value. The window
member is set to the window that is most useful to toolkit
dispatchers.</p>

<p>The window member is set to the window whose associated
colormap is changed, installed, or uninstalled. For a
colormap that is changed, installed, or uninstalled, the
colormap member is set to the colormap associated with the
window. For a colormap that is changed by a call to
XFreeColormap, the colormap member is set to None. The new
member is set to indicate whether the colormap for the
specified window was changed or installed or uninstalled and
can be True or False. If it is True, the colormap was
changed. If it is False, the colormap was installed or
uninstalled. The state member is always set to indicate
whether the colormap is installed or uninstalled and can be
ColormapIn- stalled or ColormapUninstalled.</p>
