<p>NAME Tcl_NewDictObj, Tcl_DictObjPut, Tcl_DictObjGet,
Tcl_DictObjRemove, Tcl_DictObjSize, Tcl_DictObjFirst,
Tcl_DictObjNext, Tcl_DictObjDone, Tcl_DictObjPutKeyList,
Tcl_DictObjRemoveKeyList - manipulate Tcl objects as
dictionaries</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tcl.h&gt;</p>

<p>Tcl_Obj * Tcl_NewDictObj()</p>

<p>int Tcl_DictObjGet(interp, dictPtr, keyPtr,
valuePtrPtr)</p>

<p>int Tcl_DictObjPut(interp, dictPtr, keyPtr,
valuePtr)</p>

<p>int Tcl_DictObjRemove(interp, dictPtr, keyPtr)</p>

<p>int Tcl_DictObjSize(interp, dictPtr, sizePtr)</p>

<p>int Tcl_DictObjFirst(interp, dictPtr, searchPtr,
keyPtrPtr, valuePtrPtr, donePtr)</p>

<p>void Tcl_DictObjNext(searchPtr, keyPtrPtr, valuePtrPtr,
donePtr)</p>

<p>void Tcl_DictObjDone(searchPtr)</p>

<p>int Tcl_DictObjPutKeyList(interp, dictPtr, keyc, keyv,
valuePtr)</p>

<p>int Tcl_DictObjRemoveKeyList(interp, dictPtr, keyc,
keyv)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS Tcl_Interp *interp (in) If an error occurs
while converting an object to be a dictionary object, an
error message is left in the interpreter s result object
unless interp is NULL.</p>

<p>Tcl_Obj *dictPtr (in/out) Points to the dictionary
object to be manipulated. If dictPtr does not already point
to a dictionary object, an attempt will be made to convert
it to one.</p>

<p>Tcl_Obj *keyPtr (in) Points to the key for the key/value
pair being manipu- lated within the dictionary object.</p>

<p>Tcl_Obj **keyPtrPtr (out) Points to a variable that will
have the key from a key/value pair placed within it. May be
NULL to indicate that the caller is not interested in the
key.</p>

<p>Tcl_Obj *valuePtr (in) Points to the value for the
key/value pair being manipu- late within the dictionary
object (or sub-object, in the case of Tcl_DictOb-
jPutKeyList.)</p>

<p>Tcl_Obj **valuePtrPtr (out) Points to a variable that
will have the value from a key/value pair placed within it.
For Tcl_DictObjFirst and Tcl_DictObjNext, this may be NULL
to indicate that the caller is not interested in the
value.</p>

<p>int *sizePtr (out) Points to a variable that will have
the number of key/value pairs contained within the
dictionary placed within it.</p>

<p>Tcl_DictSearch *searchPtr (in/out) Pointer to record to
use to keep track of progress in enumerating all key/value
pairs in a dictionary. The contents of the record will be
initialized by the call to Tcl_DictObjFirst. If the
enumerating is to be termi- nated before all values in the
dictionary have been returned, the search record must be
passed to Tcl_DictO- bjDone to enable the inter- nal locks
to be released.</p>

<p>int *donePtr (out) Points to a variable that will have a
non-zero value written into it when the enumeration of the
key/value pairs in a dictionary has completed, and a zero
other- wise.</p>

<p>int keyc (in) Indicates the number of keys that will be
supplied in the keyv array.</p>

<p>Tcl_Obj *const *keyv (in) Array of keyc pointers to
objects that Tcl_DictOb- jPutKeyList and Tcl_DictOb-
jRemoveKeyList will use to locate the key/value pair to
manipulate within the sub- dictionaries of the main
dictionary object passed to them.
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Tcl dictionary objects have an internal
representation that supports efficient mapping from keys to
values and which guarantees that the particular ordering of
keys within the dictionary remains the same mod- ulo any
keys being deleted (which removes them from the order) or
added (which adds them to the end of the order). If
reinterpreted as a list, the values at the even-valued
indices in the list will be the keys of the dictionary, and
each will be followed (in the odd-valued index) bu the value
associated with that key.</p>

<p>The procedures described in this man page are used to
create, modify, index, and iterate over dictionary objects
from C code.</p>

<p>Tcl_NewDictObj creates a new, empty dictionary object.
The string rep- resentation of the object will be invalid,
and the reference count of the object will be zero.</p>

<p>Tcl_DictObjGet looks up the given key within the given
dictionary and writes a pointer to the value associated with
that key into the vari- able pointed to by valuePtrPtr, or a
NULL if the key has no mapping within the dictionary. The
result of this procedure is TCL_OK, or TCL_ERROR if the
dictPtr cannot be converted to a dictionary.</p>

<p>Tcl_DictObjPut updates the given dictionary so that the
given key maps to the given value; any key may exist at most
once in any particular dictionary. The dictionary must not
be shared, but the key and value may be. This procedure may
increase the reference count of both key and value if it
proves necessary to store them. Neither key nor value should
be NULL. The result of this procedure is TCL_OK, or
TCL_ERROR if the dictPtr cannot be converted to a
dictionary.</p>

<p>Tcl_DictObjRemove updates the given dictionary so that
the given key has no mapping to any value. The dictionary
must not be shared, but the key may be. The key actually
stored in the dictionary will have its reference count
decremented if it was present. It is not an error if the key
did not previously exist. The result of this procedure is
TCL_OK, or TCL_ERROR if the dictPtr cannot be converted to a
dictio- nary.</p>

<p>Tcl_DictObjSize updates the given variable with the
number of key/value pairs currently in the given dictionary.
The result of this procedure is TCL_OK, or TCL_ERROR if the
dictPtr cannot be converted to a dictio- nary.</p>

<p>Tcl_DictObjFirst commences an iteration across all the
key/value pairs in the given dictionary, placing the key and
value in the variables pointed to by the keyPtrPtr and
valuePtrPtr arguments (which may be NULL to indicate that
the caller is uninterested in they key or vari- able
respectively.) The next key/value pair in the dictionary may
be retrieved with Tcl_DictObjNext. Concurrent updates of the
dictionarys internal representation will not modify the
iteration processing unless the dictionary is unshared, when
this will trigger premature termina- tion of the iteration
instead (which Tcl scripts cannot trigger via the dict
command.) The searchPtr argument points to a piece of
context that is used to identify which particular iteration
is being performed, and is initialized by the call to
Tcl_DictObjFirst. The donePtr argu- ment points to a
variable that is updated to be zero of there are fur- ther
key/value pairs to be iterated over, or non-zero if the
iteration is complete. The order of iteration is
implementation-defined. If the dictPtr argument cannot be
converted to a dictionary, Tcl_DictObjFirst returns
TCL_ERROR and the iteration is not commenced, and otherwise
it returns TCL_OK.</p>

<p>When Tcl_DictObjFirst is called upon a dictionary, a
lock is placed on the dictionary to enable that dictionary
to be iterated over safely without regard for whether the
dictionary is modified during the itera- tion. Because of
this, once the iteration over a dictionarys keys has
finished (whether because all values have been iterated over
as indi- cated by the variable indicated by the donePtr
argument being set to one, or because no further values are
required) the Tcl_DictObjDone function must be called with
the same searchPtr as was passed to Tcl_DictObjFirst so that
the internal locks can be released. Once a particular
searchPtr is passed to Tcl_DictObjDone, passing it to
Tcl_DictObjNext (without first initializing it with
Tcl_DictObjFirst) will result in no values being produced
and the variable pointed to by donePtr being set to one. It
is safe to call Tcl_DictObjDone multiple times on the same
searchPtr for each call to Tcl_DictObjFirst.</p>

<p>The procedures Tcl_DictObjPutKeyList and
Tcl_DictObjRemoveKeyList are the close analogues of
Tcl_DictObjPut and Tcl_DictObjRemove respec- tively, except
that instead of working with a single dictionary, they are
designed to operate on a nested tree of dictionaries, with
inner dictionaries stored as values inside outer
dictionaries. The keyc and keyv arguments specify a list of
keys (with outermost keys first) that acts as a path to the
key/value pair to be affected. Note that there is no
corresponding operation for reading a value for a path as
this is easy to construct from repeated use of
Tcl_DictObjGet. With Tcl_DictOb- jPutKeyList, nested
dictionaries are created for non-terminal keys where they do
not already exist. With Tcl_DictObjRemoveKeyList, all
non-terminal keys must exist and have dictionaries as their
values.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE Using the dictionary iteration interface to
search determine if there is a key that maps to itself:</p>

<p>Tcl_DictSearch search; Tcl_Obj *key, *value; int
done;</p>

<p>/* * Assume interp and objPtr are parameters. This is
the * idiomatic way to start an iteration over the
dictionary; it * sets a lock on the internal representation
that ensures that * there are no concurrent modification
issues when normal * reference count management is also
used. The lock is * released automatically when the loop is
finished, but must * be released manually when an
exceptional exit from the loop * is performed. However it is
safe to try to release the lock * even if weve finished
iterating over the loop. */ if (Tcl_DictObjFirst(interp,
objPtr, &amp;search, &amp;key, &amp;value, &amp;done) !=
TCL_OK) { return TCL_ERROR; } for (; !done ;
Tcl_DictObjNext(&amp;search, &amp;key, &amp;value,
&amp;done)) { /* * Note that strcmp() is not a good way of
comparing * objects and is just used here for demonstration
* purposes. */ if (!strcmp(Tcl_GetString(key),
Tcl_GetString(value))) { break; } }
Tcl_DictObjDone(&amp;search); Tcl_SetObjResult(interp,
Tcl_NewBooleanObj(!done)); return TCL_OK;</p>
