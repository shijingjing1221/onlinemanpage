<p>DESCRIPTION &quot;gprof&quot; produces an execution
profile of C, Pascal, or Fortran77 programs. The effect of
called routines is incorporated in the profile of each
caller. The profile data is taken from the call graph
profile file (gmon.out default) which is created by programs
that are compiled with the -pg option of &quot;cc&quot;,
&quot;pc&quot;, and &quot;f77&quot;. The -pg option also
links in versions of the library routines that are compiled
for profiling. &quot;Gprof&quot; reads the given object file
(the default is &quot;a.out&quot;) and establishes the
relation between its symbol table and the call graph profile
from gmon.out. If more than one profile file is specified,
the &quot;gprof&quot; output shows the sum of the profile
information in the given profile files.</p>

<p>&quot;Gprof&quot; calculates the amount of time spent in
each routine. Next, these times are propagated along the
edges of the call graph. Cycles are discovered, and calls
into a cycle are made to share the time of the cycle.</p>

<p>Several forms of output are available from the
analysis.</p>

<p>The flat profile shows how much time your program spent
in each function, and how many times that function was
called. If you simply want to know which functions burn most
of the cycles, it is stated concisely here.</p>

<p>The call graph shows, for each function, which functions
called it, which other functions it called, and how many
times. There is also an estimate of how much time was spent
in the subroutines of each function. This can suggest places
where you might try to eliminate function calls that use a
lot of time.</p>

<p>The annotated source listing is a copy of the programs
source code, labeled with the number of times each line of
the program was executed.</p>

<p>OPTIONS These options specify which of several output
formats &quot;gprof&quot; should produce.</p>

<p>Many of these options take an optional symspec to
specify functions to be included or excluded. These options
can be specified multiple times, with different symspecs, to
include or exclude sets of symbols.</p>

<p>Specifying any of these options overrides the default
(-p -q), which prints a flat profile and call graph analysis
for all functions.</p>

<p>&quot;-A[symspec]&quot;
&quot;--annotated-source[=symspec]&quot; The -A option
causes &quot;gprof&quot; to print annotated source code. If
symspec is specified, print output only for matching
symbols.</p>

<p>&quot;-b&quot; &quot;--brief&quot; If the -b option is
given, &quot;gprof&quot; doesnt print the verbose blurbs
that try to explain the meaning of all of the fields in the
tables. This is useful if you intend to print out the
output, or are tired of seeing the blurbs.</p>

<p>&quot;-C[symspec]&quot;
&quot;--exec-counts[=symspec]&quot; The -C option causes
&quot;gprof&quot; to print a tally of functions and the
number of times each was called. If symspec is specified,
print tally only for matching symbols.</p>

<p>If the profile data file contains basic-block count
records, specifying the -l option, along with -C, will cause
basic-block execution counts to be tallied and
displayed.</p>

<p>&quot;-i&quot; &quot;--file-info&quot; The -i option
causes &quot;gprof&quot; to display summary information
about the profile data file(s) and then exit. The number of
histogram, call graph, and basic-block count records is
displayed.</p>

<p>&quot;-I dirs&quot; &quot;--directory-path=dirs&quot;
The -I option specifies a list of search directories in
which to find source files. Environment variable GPROF_PATH
can also be used to convey this information. Used mostly for
annotated source output.</p>

<p>&quot;-J[symspec]&quot;
&quot;--no-annotated-source[=symspec]&quot; The -J option
causes &quot;gprof&quot; not to print annotated source code.
If symspec is specified, &quot;gprof&quot; prints annotated
source, but excludes matching symbols.</p>

<p>&quot;-L&quot; &quot;--print-path&quot; Normally, source
filenames are printed with the path component suppressed.
The -L option causes &quot;gprof&quot; to print the full
pathname of source filenames, which is determined from
symbolic debugging information in the image file and is
relative to the directory in which the compiler was
invoked.</p>

<p>&quot;-p[symspec]&quot;
&quot;--flat-profile[=symspec]&quot; The -p option causes
&quot;gprof&quot; to print a flat profile. If symspec is
specified, print flat profile only for matching symbols.</p>

<p>&quot;-P[symspec]&quot;
&quot;--no-flat-profile[=symspec]&quot; The -P option causes
&quot;gprof&quot; to suppress printing a flat profile. If
symspec is specified, &quot;gprof&quot; prints a flat
profile, but excludes matching symbols.</p>

<p>&quot;-q[symspec]&quot; &quot;--graph[=symspec]&quot;
The -q option causes &quot;gprof&quot; to print the call
graph analysis. If symspec is specified, print call graph
only for matching symbols and their children.</p>

<p>&quot;-Q[symspec]&quot; &quot;--no-graph[=symspec]&quot;
The -Q option causes &quot;gprof&quot; to suppress printing
the call graph. If symspec is specified, &quot;gprof&quot;
prints a call graph, but excludes matching symbols.</p>

<p>&quot;-t&quot; &quot;--table-length=num&quot; The -t
option causes the num most active source lines in each
source file to be listed when source annotation is enabled.
The default is 10.</p>

<p>&quot;-y&quot; &quot;--separate-files&quot; This option
affects annotated source output only. Normally,
&quot;gprof&quot; prints annotated source files to
standard-output. If this option is specified, annotated
source for a file named path/filename is generated in the
file filename-ann. If the underlying file system would
truncate filename-ann so that it overwrites the original
filename, &quot;gprof&quot; generates annotated source in
the file filename.ann instead (if the original file name has
an extension, that extension is replaced with .ann).</p>

<p>&quot;-Z[symspec]&quot;
&quot;--no-exec-counts[=symspec]&quot; The -Z option causes
&quot;gprof&quot; not to print a tally of functions and the
number of times each was called. If symspec is specified,
print tally, but exclude matching symbols.</p>

<p>&quot;-r&quot; &quot;--function-ordering&quot; The
--function-ordering option causes &quot;gprof&quot; to print
a suggested function ordering for the program based on
profiling data. This option suggests an ordering which may
improve paging, tlb and cache behavior for the program on
systems which support arbitrary ordering of functions in an
executable.</p>

<p>The exact details of how to force the linker to place
functions in a particular order is system dependent and out
of the scope of this manual.</p>

<p>&quot;-R map_file&quot; &quot;--file-ordering
map_file&quot; The --file-ordering option causes
&quot;gprof&quot; to print a suggested .o link line ordering
for the program based on profiling data. This option
suggests an ordering which may improve paging, tlb and cache
behavior for the program on systems which do not support
arbitrary ordering of functions in an executable.</p>

<p>Use of the -a argument is highly recommended with this
option.</p>

<p>The map_file argument is a pathname to a file which
provides function name to object file mappings. The format
of the file is similar to the output of the program
&quot;nm&quot;.</p>

<p>c-parse.o:00000000 T yyparse c-parse.o:00000004 C
yyerrflag c-lang.o:00000000 T maybe_objc_method_name
c-lang.o:00000000 T print_lang_statistics c-lang.o:00000000
T recognize_objc_keyword c-decl.o:00000000 T
print_lang_identifier c-decl.o:00000000 T print_lang_type
...</p>

<p>To create a map_file with GNU &quot;nm&quot;, type a
command like &quot;nm --extern-only --defined-only -v
--print-file-name program-name&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;-T&quot; &quot;--traditional&quot; The -T option
causes &quot;gprof&quot; to print its output in
&quot;traditional&quot; BSD style.</p>

<p>&quot;-w width&quot; &quot;--width=width&quot; Sets
width of output lines to width. Currently only used when
printing the function index at the bottom of the call
graph.</p>

<p>&quot;-x&quot; &quot;--all-lines&quot; This option
affects annotated source output only. By default, only the
lines at the beginning of a basic-block are annotated. If
this option is specified, every line in a basic-block is
annotated by repeating the annotation for the first line.
This behavior is similar to &quot;tcov&quot;s -a.</p>

<p>&quot;--demangle[=style]&quot; &quot;--no-demangle&quot;
These options control whether C++ symbol names should be
demangled when printing output. The default is to demangle
symbols. The &quot;--no-demangle&quot; option may be used to
turn off demangling. Different compilers have different
mangling styles. The optional demangling style argument can
be used to choose an appropriate demangling style for your
compiler.</p>

<p>Analysis Options &quot;-a&quot; &quot;--no-static&quot;
The -a option causes &quot;gprof&quot; to suppress the
printing of statically declared (private) functions. (These
are functions whose names are not listed as global, and
which are not visible outside the file/function/block where
they were defined.) Time spent in these functions, calls
to/from them, etc., will all be attributed to the function
that was loaded directly before it in the executable file.
This option affects both the flat profile and the call
graph.</p>

<p>&quot;-c&quot; &quot;--static-call-graph&quot; The -c
option causes the call graph of the program to be augmented
by a heuristic which examines the text space of the object
file and identifies function calls in the binary machine
code. Since normal call graph records are only generated
when functions are entered, this option identifies children
that could have been called, but never were. Calls to
functions that were not compiled with profiling enabled are
also identified, but only if symbol table entries are
present for them. Calls to dynamic library routines are
typically not found by this option. Parents or children
identified via this heuristic are indicated in the call
graph with call counts of 0.</p>

<p>&quot;-D&quot; &quot;--ignore-non-functions&quot; The -D
option causes &quot;gprof&quot; to ignore symbols which are
not known to be functions. This option will give more
accurate profile data on systems where it is supported
(Solaris and HPUX for example).</p>

<p>&quot;-k from/to&quot; The -k option allows you to
delete from the call graph any arcs from symbols matching
symspec from to those matching symspec to.</p>

<p>&quot;-l&quot; &quot;--line&quot; The -l option enables
line-by-line profiling, which causes histogram hits to be
charged to individual source code lines, instead of
functions. This feature only works with programs compiled by
older versions of the &quot;gcc&quot; compiler. Newer
versions of &quot;gcc&quot; are designed to work with the
&quot;gcov&quot; tool instead.</p>

<p>If the program was compiled with basic-block counting
enabled, this option will also identify how many times each
line of code was executed. While line-by-line profiling can
help isolate where in a large function a program is spending
its time, it also significantly increases the running time
of &quot;gprof&quot;, and magnifies statistical
inaccuracies.</p>

<p>&quot;-m num&quot; &quot;--min-count=num&quot; This
option affects execution count output only. Symbols that are
executed less than num times are suppressed.</p>

<p>&quot;-nsymspec&quot; &quot;--time=symspec&quot; The -n
option causes &quot;gprof&quot;, in its call graph analysis,
to only propagate times for symbols matching symspec.</p>

<p>&quot;-Nsymspec&quot; &quot;--no-time=symspec&quot; The
-n option causes &quot;gprof&quot;, in its call graph
analysis, not to propagate times for symbols matching
symspec.</p>

<p>&quot;-Sfilename&quot;
&quot;--external-symbol-table=filename&quot; The -S option
causes &quot;gprof&quot; to read an external symbol table
file, such as /proc/kallsyms, rather than read the symbol
table from the given object file (the default is
&quot;a.out&quot;). This is useful for profiling kernel
modules.</p>

<p>&quot;-z&quot; &quot;--display-unused-functions&quot; If
you give the -z option, &quot;gprof&quot; will mention all
functions in the flat profile, even those that were never
called, and that had no time spent in them. This is useful
in conjunction with the -c option for discovering which
routines were never called.</p>

<p>Miscellaneous Options &quot;-d[num]&quot;
&quot;--debug[=num]&quot; The -d num option specifies
debugging options. If num is not specified, enable all
debugging.</p>

<p>&quot;-h&quot; &quot;--help&quot; The -h option prints
command line usage.</p>

<p>&quot;-Oname&quot; &quot;--file-format=name&quot;
Selects the format of the profile data files. Recognized
formats are auto (the default), bsd, 4.4bsd, magic, and prof
(not yet supported).</p>

<p>&quot;-s&quot; &quot;--sum&quot; The -s option causes
&quot;gprof&quot; to summarize the information in the
profile data files it read in, and write out a profile data
file called gmon.sum, which contains all the information
from the profile data files that &quot;gprof&quot; read in.
The file gmon.sum may be one of the specified input files;
the effect of this is to merge the data in the other input
files into gmon.sum.</p>

<p>Eventually you can run &quot;gprof&quot; again without
-s to analyze the cumulative data in the file gmon.sum.</p>

<p>&quot;-v&quot; &quot;--version&quot; The -v flag causes
&quot;gprof&quot; to print the current version number, and
then exit.</p>

<p>Deprecated Options These options have been replaced with
newer versions that use symspecs.</p>

<p>&quot;-e function_name&quot;</p>

<p>The -e function option tells &quot;gprof&quot; to not
print information about the function function_name (and its
children...) in the call graph. The function will still be
listed as a child of any functions that call it, but its
index number will be shown as [not printed]. More than one
-e option may be given; only one function_name may be
indicated with each -e option.</p>

<p>&quot;-E function_name&quot;</p>

<p>The &quot;-E function&quot; option works like the
&quot;-e&quot; option, but time spent in the function (and
children who were not called from anywhere else), will not
be used to compute the percentages-of-time for the call
graph. More than one -E option may be given; only one
function_name may be indicated with each -E option.</p>

<p>&quot;-f function_name&quot;</p>

<p>The -f function option causes &quot;gprof&quot; to limit
the call graph to the function function_name and its
children (and their children...). More than one -f option
may be given; only one function_name may be indicated with
each -f option.</p>

<p>&quot;-F function_name&quot;</p>

<p>The -F function option works like the &quot;-f&quot;
option, but only time spent in the function and its children
(and their children...) will be used to determine total-time
and percentages-of-time for the call graph. More than one -F
option may be given; only one function_name may be indicated
with each -F option. The -F option overrides the -E
option.</p>

<p>FILES &quot;a.out&quot; the namelist and text space.</p>

<p>&quot;gmon.out&quot; dynamic call graph and profile.</p>

<p>&quot;gmon.sum&quot; summarized dynamic call graph and
profile.</p>

<p>BUGS The granularity of the sampling is shown, but
remains statistical at best. We assume that the time for
each execution of a function can be expressed by the total
time for the function divided by the number of times the
function is called. Thus the time propagated along the call
graph arcs to the function s parents is directly
proportional to the number of times that arc is
traversed.</p>

<p>Parents that are not themselves profiled will have the
time of their profiled children propagated to them, but they
will appear to be spontaneously invoked in the call graph
listing, and will not have their time propagated further.
Similarly, signal catchers, even though profiled, will
appear to be spontaneous (although for more obscure
reasons). Any profiled children of signal catchers should
have their times propagated properly, unless the signal
catcher was invoked during the execution of the profiling
routine, in which case all is lost.</p>

<p>The profiled program must call &quot;exit&quot;(2) or
return normally for the profiling information to be saved in
the gmon.out file.</p>
