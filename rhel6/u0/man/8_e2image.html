<p>NAME e2image - Save critical ext2/ext3/ext4 filesystem
metadata to a file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS e2image [ -rsI ] device image-file</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The e2image program will save critical ext2,
ext3, or ext4 filesystem metadata located on device to a
file specified by image-file. The image file may be examined
by dumpe2fs and debugfs, by using the -i option to those
programs. This can assist an expert in recovering
catastrophically corrupted filesystems. In the future,
e2fsck will be enhanced to be able to use the image file to
help recover a badly dam- aged filesystem.</p>

<p>If image-file is -, then the output of e2image will be
sent to standard output, so that the output can be piped to
another program, such as gzip(1). (Note that this is
currently only supported when creating a raw image file
using the -r option, since the process of creating a normal
image file currently requires random access to the file,
which cannot be done using a pipe. This restriction will
hopefully be lifted in a future version of e2image.)</p>

<p>It is a very good idea to create image files for all of
filesystems on a system and save the partition layout (which
can be generated using the fdisk -l command) at regular
intervals --- at boot time, and/or every week or so. The
image file should be stored on some filesystem other than
the filesystem whose data it contains, to ensure that this
data is accessible in the case where the filesystem has been
badly dam- aged.</p>

<p>To save disk space, e2image creates the image file as a
sparse file. Hence, if the image file needs to be copied to
another location, it should either be compressed first or
copied using the --sparse=always option to the GNU version
of cp.</p>

<p>The size of an ext2 image file depends primarily on the
size of the filesystems and how many inodes are in use. For
a typical 10 gigabyte filesystem, with 200,000 inodes in use
out of 1.2 million inodes, the image file will be
approximately 35 megabytes; a 4 gigabyte filesystem with
15,000 inodes in use out of 550,000 inodes will result in a
3 megabyte image file. Image files tend to be quite
compressible; an image file taking up 32 megabytes of space
on disk will generally com- press down to 3 or 4
megabytes.</p>

<p>RESTORING FILESYSTEM METADATA USING AN IMAGE FILE The -I
option will cause e2image to install the metadata stored in
the image file back to the device. It can be used to restore
the filesystem metadata back to the device in emergency
situations.</p>

<p>WARNING!!!! The -I option should only be used as a
desperation measure when other alternatives have failed. If
the filesystem has changed since the image file was created,
data will be lost. In general, you should make a full image
backup of the filesystem first, in case you wish to try
other recovery strategies afterwards.</p>

<p>RAW IMAGE FILES The -r option will create a raw image
file instead of a normal image file. A raw image file
differs from a normal image file in two ways. First, the
filesystem metadata is placed in the proper position so that
e2fsck, dumpe2fs, debugfs, etc. can be run directly on the
raw image file. In order to minimize the amount of disk
space consumed by a raw image file, the file is created as a
sparse file. (Beware of copying or compressing/decompressing
this file with utilities that dont under- stand how to
create sparse files; the file will become as large as the
filesystem itself!) Secondly, the raw image file also
includes indi- rect blocks and directory blocks, which the
standard image file does not have, although this may change
in the future.</p>

<p>Raw image files are sometimes used when sending
filesystems to the maintainer as part of bug reports to
e2fsprogs. When used in this capacity, the recommended
command is as follows (replace hda1 with the appropriate
device):</p>

<p>e2image -r /dev/hda1 - | bzip2 &gt; hda1.e2i.bz2</p>

<p>This will only send the metadata information, without
any data blocks. However, the filenames in the directory
blocks can still reveal infor- mation about the contents of
the filesystem that the bug reporter may wish to keep
confidential. To address this concern, the -s option can be
specified. This will cause e2image to scramble directory
entries and zero out any unused portions of the directory
blocks before writing the image file. However, the -s option
will prevent analysis of prob- lems related to hash-tree
indexed directories.</p>
