<p>NAME pci_get_slot - locate PCI device for a given PCI
slot</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS struct pci_dev * pci_get_slot(struct pci_bus *
bus, unsigned int devfn);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS bus PCI bus on which desired PCI device
resides</p>

<p>devfn encodes number of PCI slot in which the desired
PCI device resides and the logical device number within that
slot in case of multi-function devices.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Given a PCI bus and slot/function number,
the desired PCI device is located in the list of PCI
devices. If the device is found, its reference count is
increased and this function returns a pointer to its data
structure. The caller must decrement the reference count by
calling pci_dev_put. If no device is found, NULL is
returned.</p>
