<p>REGEXP_TABLE(5) REGEXP_TABLE(5)</p>

<p>NAME regexp_table - format of Postfix regular expression
tables</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS postmap -q &quot;string&quot;
regexp:/etc/postfix/filename</p>

<p>postmap -q - regexp:/etc/postfix/filename
&lt;inputfile</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The Postfix mail system uses optional tables
for address rewriting, mail routing, or access control.
These tables are usually in dbm or db format.</p>

<p>Alternatively, lookup tables can be specified in POSIX
regular expres- sion form. In this case, each input is
compared against a list of pat- terns. When a match is
found, the corresponding result is returned and the search
is terminated.</p>

<p>To find out what types of lookup tables your Postfix
system supports use the &quot;postconf -m&quot; command.</p>

<p>To test lookup tables, use the &quot;postmap -q&quot;
command as described in the SYNOPSIS above.</p>

<p>COMPATIBILITY With Postfix version 2.2 and earlier
specify &quot;postmap -fq&quot; to query a table that
contains case sensitive patterns. Patterns are case insensi-
tive by default.</p>

<p>TABLE FORMAT The general form of a Postfix regular
expression table is:</p>

<p>/pattern/flags result When pattern matches the input
string, use the corresponding result value.</p>

<p>!/pattern/flags result When pattern does not match the
input string, use the corre- sponding result value.</p>

<p>if /pattern/flags</p>

<p>endif Match the input string against the patterns
between if and endif, if and only if that same input string
also matches pat- tern. The if..endif can nest.</p>

<p>Note: do not prepend whitespace to patterns inside
if..endif.</p>

<p>This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.</p>

<p>if !/pattern/flags</p>

<p>endif Match the input string against the patterns
between if and endif, if and only if that same input string
does not match pat- tern. The if..endif can nest.</p>

<p>Note: do not prepend whitespace to patterns inside
if..endif.</p>

<p>This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.</p>

<p>blank lines and comments Empty lines and whitespace-only
lines are ignored, as are lines whose first non-whitespace
character is a #.</p>

<p>multi-line text A logical line starts with
non-whitespace text. A line that starts with whitespace
continues a logical line.</p>

<p>Each pattern is a POSIX regular expression enclosed by a
pair of delim- iters. The regular expression syntax is
documented in re_format(7) with 4.4BSD, in regex(5) with
Solaris, and in regex(7) with Linux. Other systems may use
other document names.</p>

<p>The expression delimiter can be any character, except
whitespace or characters that have special meaning
(traditionally the forward slash is used). The regular
expression can contain whitespace.</p>

<p>By default, matching is case-insensitive, and newlines
are not treated as special characters. The behavior is
controlled by flags, which are toggled by appending one or
more of the following characters after the pattern:</p>

<p>i (default: on) Toggles the case sensitivity flag. By
default, matching is case insensitive.</p>

<p>m (default: off) Toggle the multi-line mode flag. When
this flag is on, the ^ and $ metacharacters match
immediately after and immediately before a newline
character, respectively, in addition to matching at the
start and end of the input string.</p>

<p>x (default: on) Toggles the extended expression syntax
flag. By default, support for extended expression syntax is
enabled.</p>

<p>TABLE SEARCH ORDER Patterns are applied in the order as
specified in the table, until a pattern is found that
matches the input string.</p>

<p>Each pattern is applied to the entire input string.
Depending on the application, that string is an entire
client hostname, an entire client IP address, or an entire
mail address. Thus, no parent domain or par- ent network
search is done, and user@domain mail addresses are not bro-
ken up into their user and domain constituent parts, nor is
user+foo broken up into user and foo.</p>

<p>TEXT SUBSTITUTION Substitution of substrings from the
matched expression into the result string is possible using
$1, $2, etc.; specify $$ to produce a $ char- acter as
output. The macros in the result string may need to be writ-
ten as ${n} or $(n) if they arent followed by
whitespace.</p>

<p>Note: since negated patterns (those preceded by !)
return a result when the expression does not match,
substitutions are not available for negated patterns.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE SMTPD ACCESS MAP # Disallow sender-specified
routing. This is a must if you relay mail # for other
domains. /[%!@].*[%!@]/ 550 Sender-specified routing
rejected</p>

<p># Postmaster is OK, that way they can talk to us about
how to fix # their problem. /^postmaster@/ OK</p>

<p># Protect your outgoing majordomo exploders if
!/^owner-/ /^(.*)-outgoing@(.*)$/ 550 Use ${1}@${2} instead
endif</p>

<p>EXAMPLE HEADER FILTER MAP # These were once common in
junk mail. /^Subject: make money fast/ REJECT /^To:
friend@public.com/ REJECT</p>

<p>EXAMPLE BODY FILTER MAP # First skip over base 64
encoded text to save CPU cycles. ~^[[:alnum:]+/]{60,}$~
OK</p>

<p># Put your own body patterns here.</p>
