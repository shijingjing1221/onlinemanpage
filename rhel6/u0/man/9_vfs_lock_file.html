<p>VFS_LOCK_FILE(9) The Linux VFS VFS_LOCK_FILE(9)</p>

<p>NAME vfs_lock_file - file byte range lock</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS int vfs_lock_file(struct file * filp, unsigned
int cmd, struct file_lock * fl, struct file_lock *
conf);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS filp The file to apply the lock to</p>

<p>cmd type of locking operation (F_SETLK, F_GETLK,
etc.)</p>

<p>fl The lock to be applied</p>

<p>conf Place to return a copy of the conflicting lock, if
found.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION A caller that doesn&acute;t care about the
conflicting lock may pass NULL as the final argument.</p>

<p>If the filesystem defines a private -&gt;lock method,
then conf will be left unchanged; so a caller that cares
should initialize it to some acceptable default.</p>

<p>To avoid blocking kernel daemons, such as lockd, that
need to acquire POSIX locks, the -&gt;lock interface may
return asynchronously, before the lock has been granted or
denied by the underlying filesystem, if (and only if)
fl_grant is set. Callers expecting -&gt;lock to return
asynchronously will only use F_SETLK, not F_SETLKW; they
will set FL_SLEEP if (and only if) the request is for a
blocking lock. When -&gt;lock does return asynchronously, it
must return FILE_LOCK_DEFERRED, and call -&gt;fl_grant when
the lock request completes. If the request is for
non-blocking lock the file system should return
FILE_LOCK_DEFERRED then try to get the lock and call the
callback routine with the result. If the request timed out
the callback routine will return a nonzero return code and
the file system should release the lock. The file system is
also responsible to keep a corresponding posix lock when it
grants a lock so the VFS can find out which locks are
locally held and do the correct lock cleanup when required.
The underlying filesystem must not drop the kernel lock or
call -&gt;fl_grant before returning to the caller with a
FILE_LOCK_DEFERRED return code.</p>
