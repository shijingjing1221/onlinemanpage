<p>NAME snmpd.examples - example configuration for the
Net-SNMP agent</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The snmpd.conf(5) man page defines the
syntax and behaviour of the var- ious configuration
directives that can be used to control the operation of the
Net-SNMP agent, and the management information it
provides.</p>

<p>This companion man page illustrates these directives,
showing some practical examples of how they might be
used.</p>

<p>AGENT BEHAVIOUR Listening addresses The default agent
behaviour (listing on the standard SNMP UDP port on all
interfaces) is equivalent to the directive: agentaddress
udp:161 or simply agentaddress 161 The agent can be
configured to only accept requests sent to the local
loopback interface (again listening on the SNMP UDP port),
using: agentaddress localhost:161 # (udp implicit) or
agentaddress 127.0.0.1 # (udp and standard port implicit) It
can be configured to accept both UDP and TCP requests (over
both IPv4 and IPv6), using: agentaddress
udp:161,tcp:161,udp6:161,tcp6:161 Other combinations are
also valid.</p>

<p>Run-time privileges The agent can be configured to
relinquish any privileged access once it has opened the
initial listening ports. Given a suitable &quot;snmp&quot;
group (defined in /etc/group), this could be done using the
directives: agentuser nobody agentgroup snmp A similar
effect could be achieved using numeric UID and/or GID
values: agentuser #10 agentgroup #10</p>

<p>SNMPv3 Configuration Rather than being generated
pseudo-randomly, the engine ID for the agent could be
calculated based on the MAC address of the second net- work
interface (eth1), using the directives: engineIDType 3
engineIDNic eth1 or it could be calculated from the (first)
IP address, using: engineIDType 1 or it could be specified
explicitly, using: engineID &quot;XXX - WHAT
FORMAT&quot;</p>

<p>ACCESS CONTROL SNMPv3 Users The following directives
will create three users, all using exactly the same
authentication and encryption settings: createUser me MD5
&quot;single pass phrase&quot; createUser myself MD5
&quot;single pass phrase&quot; DES createUser andI MD5
&quot;single pass phrase&quot; DES &quot;single pass
phrase&quot; Note that this defines three distinct users,
who could be granted dif- ferent levels of access. Changing
the passphrase for any one of these would not affect the
other two.</p>

<p>Separate pass phrases can be specified for
authentication and encryp- tion: createUser onering SHA
&quot;to rule them all&quot; AES &quot;to bind them&quot;
Remember that these createUser directives should be defined
in the /var/lib/net-snmp/snmpd.conf file, rather than the
usual location.</p>

<p>Traditional Access Control The SNMPv3 users defined
above can be granted access to the full MIB tree using the
directives: rouser me rwuser onering Or selective access to
individual subtrees using: rouser myself .1.3.6.1.2 rwuser
andI system</p>

<p>Note that a combination repeating the same user, such
as: rouser onering rwuser onering should not be used. This
would configure the user onering with read- only access (and
ignore the rwuser entry altogether). The same holds for the
community-based directives.</p>

<p>The directives: rocommunity public rwcommunity private
would define the commonly-expected read and write community
strings for SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c requests. This behaviour is
not configured by default, and would need to be set up
explicitly.</p>

<p>Note: It would also be a very good idea to change
private to something a little less predictable!</p>

<p>A slightly less vulnerable configuration might restrict
what informa- tion could be retrieved: rocommunity public
default system or the management systems that settings could
be manipulated from: rwcommunity private 10.10.10.0/24 or a
combination of the two.</p>

<p>VACM Configuration This last pair of settings are
equivalent to the full VACM definitions: # sec.name source
community com2sec public default public com2sec mynet
10.10.10.0/24 private com2sec6 mynet fec0::/64 private</p>

<p># sec.model sec.name group worldGroup v1 public group
worldGroup v2c public group myGroup v1 mynet group myGroup
v2c mynet</p>

<p># incl/excl subtree [mask] view all included .1 view
sysView included system</p>

<p># context model level prefix read write notify (unused)
access worldGroup &quot;&quot; any noauth exact system none
none access myGroup &quot;&quot; any noauth exact all all
none</p>

<p>There are several points to note in this example:</p>

<p>The group directives must be repeated for both SNMPv1
and SNMPv2c requests.</p>

<p>The com2sec security name is distinct from the community
string that is mapped to it. They can be the same
(&quot;public&quot;) or different
(&quot;mynet&quot;/&quot;private&quot;) - but what appears
in the group directive is the security name, regardless of
the original community string.</p>

<p>Both of the view directives are defining simple OID
subtrees, so nei- ther of these require an explicit mask.
The same holds for the &quot;com- bined subtree2 view
defined below. In fact, a mask field is only needed when
defining row slices across a table (or similar views), and
can almost always be omitted.</p>

<p>In general, it is advisible not to mix traditional and
VACM-based access configuration settings, as these can
sometimes interfere with each other in unexpected ways.
Choose a particular style of access configuration, and stick
to it.</p>

<p>Typed-View Configuration A similar configuration could
also be configured as follows: view sys2View included system
view sys2View included .1.3.6.1.2.1.25.1</p>

<p>authcommunity read public default -v sys2View
authcommunity read,write private 10.10.10.0/8</p>

<p>This mechanism allows multi-subtree (or other
non-simple) views to be used with the one-line rocommunity
style of configuration.</p>

<p>It would also support configuring &quot;write-only&quot;
access, should this be required.</p>

<p>SYSTEM INFORMATION System Group The full contents of the
system group (with the exception of sysUp- Time) can be
explicitly configured using: # Override _uname -a_ and
hardcoded system OID - inherently read-only values sysDescr
Universal Turing Machine mk I sysObjectID
.1.3.6.1.4.1.8072.3.2.1066</p>

<p># Override default values from _configure_ - makes these
objects read-only sysContact Alan.Turing@pre-cs.man.ac.uk
sysName tortoise.turing.com sysLocation An idea in the mind
of AT</p>

<p># Standard end-host behaviour sysServices 72</p>

<p>Host Resources Group The list of devices probed for
potential inclusion in the hrDiskStor- ageTable (and
hrDeviceTable) can be amended using any of the following
directives: ignoredisk /dev/rdsk/c0t2d0 which prevents the
device /dev/rdsk/c0t2d0 from being scanned, ignoredisk
/dev/rdsk/c0t[!6]d0 ignoredisk /dev/rdsk/c0t[0-57-9a-f]d0
either of which prevents all devices /dev/rdsk/c0tXd0
(except .../c0t6d0) from being scanned, ignoredisk
/dev/rdsk/c1* which prevents all devices whose device names
start with /dev/rdsk/c1 from being scanned, or ignoredisk
/dev/rdsk/c?t0d0 which prevents all devices /dev/rdsk/cXt0d0
(where X is any single character) from being scanned.</p>

<p>Process Monitoring The list of services running on a
system can be monitored (and provi- sion made for correcting
any problems), using: # At least one web server process must
be running at all times proc httpd procfix httpd
/etc/rc.d/init.d/httpd restart</p>

<p># There should never be more than 10 mail processes
running # (more implies a probable mail storm, so shut down
the mail system) proc sendmail 10 procfix sendmail
/etc/rc.d/init.d/sendmail stop</p>

<p># There should be a single network management agent
running # (&quot;There can be only one&quot;) proc snmpd 1 1
Also see the &quot;DisMan Event MIB&quot; section later
on.</p>

<p>Disk Usage Monitoring The state of disk storage can be
monitored using: includeAllDisks 10% disk /var 20% disk /usr
3% # Keep 100 MB free for crash dumps disk /mnt/crash
100000</p>

<p>System Load Monitoring A simple check for an overloaded
system might be: load 10 A more refined check (to allow
brief periods of heavy use, but recog- nise sustained
medium-heavy load) might be: load 30 10 5</p>

<p>Log File Monitoring TODO file FILE [MAXSIZE] logmatch
NAME PATH CYCLETIME REGEX</p>

<p>ACTIVE MONITORING Notification Handling Configuring the
agent to report invalid access attempts might be done by:
authtrapenable 1 trapcommunity public trap2sink localhost
Alternatively, the second and third directives could be
combined (and an acknowledgement requested) using:
informsink localhost public A configuration with repeated
sink destinations, such as: trapsink localhost trap2sink
localhost informsink localhost should NOT be used, as this
will cause multiple copies of each trap to be sent to the
same trap receiver.</p>

<p>TODO - discuss SNMPv3 traps trapsess snmpv3 options
localhost:162</p>

<p>TODO - mention trapd access configuration</p>

<p>DisMan Event MIB The simplest configuration for active
self-monitoring of the agent, by the agent, for the agent,
is probably: # Set up the credentials to retrieve monitored
values createUser _internal MD5 &quot;the first sign of
madness&quot; iquerySecName _internal rouser _internal</p>

<p># Active the standard monitoring entries defaultMonitors
yes linkUpDownNotifications yes</p>

<p># If theres a problem, then tell someone! trap2sink
localhost</p>

<p>The first block sets up a suitable user for retrieving
the information to by monitored, while the following pair of
directives activates vari- ous built-in monitoring
entries.</p>

<p>Note that the DisMan directives are not themselves
sufficient to actively report problems - there also needs to
be a suitable destina- tion configured to actually send the
resulting notifications to.</p>

<p>A more detailed monitor example is given by: monitor -u
me -o hrSWRunName &quot;high process memory&quot; hrSWRun-
PerfMem &gt; 10000</p>

<p>This defines an explicit boolean monitor entry, looking
for any process using more than 10MB of active memory. Such
processes will be reported using the (standard) DisMan trap
mteTriggerFired, but adding an extra (wildcarded) varbind
hrSWRunName.</p>

<p>This entry also specifies an explicit user (me, as
defined earlier) for retrieving the monitored values, and
building the trap.</p>

<p>Objects that could potentially fluctuate around the
specified level are better monitored using a threshold
monitor entry: monitor -D -r 10 &quot;network traffic&quot;
ifInOctets 1000000 5000000</p>

<p>This will send a mteTriggerRising trap whenever the
incoming traffic rises above (roughly) 500 kB/s on any
network interface, and a corre- sponding mteTriggerFalling
trap when it falls below 100 kB/s again.</p>

<p>Note that this monitors the deltas between successive
samples (-D) rather than the actual sample values
themselves. The same effect could be obtained using: monitor
-r 10 &quot;network traffic&quot; ifInOctets - - 1000000
5000000</p>

<p>The linkUpDownNotifications directive above is broadly
equivalent to: notificationEvent linkUpTrap linkUp ifIndex
ifAdminStatus ifOperStatus notificationEvent linkDownTrap
linkDown ifIndex ifAdminStatus ifOperStatus</p>

<p>monitor -r 60 -e linkUpTrap &quot;Generate linkUp&quot;
ifOperStatus != 2 monitor -r 60 -e linkDownTrap
&quot;Generate linkDown&quot; ifOperStatus == 2</p>

<p>This defines the traps to be sent (using
notificationEvent), and explicitly references the relevant
notification in the corresponding monitor entry (rather than
using the default DisMan traps).</p>

<p>The defaultMonitors directive above is equivalent to a
series of (boolean) monitor entries: monitor -o prNames -o
prErrMessage &quot;procTable&quot; prErrorFlag != 0 monitor
-o memErrorName -o memSwapErrorMsg &quot;memory&quot;
memSwapError != 0 monitor -o extNames -o extOutput
&quot;extTable&quot; extResult != 0 monitor -o dskPath -o
dskErrorMsg &quot;dskTable&quot; dskErrorFlag != 0 monitor
-o laNames -o laErrMessage &quot;laTable&quot; laErrorFlag
!= 0 monitor -o fileName -o fileErrorMsg
&quot;fileTable&quot; fileErrorFlag != 0 and will send a
trap whenever any of these entries indicate a problem.</p>

<p>An alternative approach would be to automatically invoke
the corre- sponding &quot;fix&quot; action: setEvent prFixIt
prErrFix = 1 monitor -e prFixIt &quot;procTable&quot;
prErrorFlag != 0 (and similarly for any of the other
defaultMonitor entries).</p>

<p>DisMan Schedule MIB The agent could be configured to
reload its configuration once an hour, using: repeat 3600
versionUpdateConfig.0 = 1</p>

<p>Alternatively this could be configured to be run at
specific times of day (perhaps following rotation of the
logs): cron 10 0 * * * versionUpdateConfig.0 = 1</p>

<p>The one-shot style of scheduling is rather less common,
but the secret SNMP virus could be activated on the next
occurance of Friday 13th using: at 13 13 13 * 5 snmpVirus.0
= 1</p>

<p>EXTENDING AGENT FUNCTIONALITY Arbitrary Extension
Commands Old Style exec [MIBOID] NAME PROG ARGS&quot; sh
[MIBOID] NAME PROG ARGS&quot; execfix NAME PROG ARGS&quot;
New Style extend [MIBOID] NAME PROG ARGS&quot; extendfix
[MIBOID] NAME PROG ARGS&quot;</p>

<p>MIB-Specific Extension Commands One-Shot &quot;pass [-p
priority] MIBOID PROG&quot;</p>

<p>Persistent &quot;pass_persist [-p priority] MIBOID
PROG&quot;</p>

<p>Embedded Perl Support If embedded perl support is
enabled in the agent, the default initiali- sation is
equivalent to the directives: disablePerl false perlInitFile
/usr/share/snmp/snmp_perl.pl The main mechanism for defining
embedded perl scripts is the perl directive. A very simple
(if somewhat pointless) MIB handler could be registered
using: perl use Data::Dumper; perl sub myroutine { print
&quot;got called: &quot;,Dumper(@_),&quot;0; } perl
$agent-&gt;register( mylink , .1.3.6.1.8765 ,
myroutine);</p>

<p>This relies on the $agent object, defined in the example
snmp_perl.pl file.</p>

<p>A more realistic MIB handler might be: XXX - WHAT ???
Alternatively, this code could be stored in an external
file, and loaded using: perl do
/usr/share/snmp/perl_example.pl;</p>

<p>Dynamically Loadable Modules TODO dlmod NAME
PATH&quot;</p>

<p>Proxy Support A configuration for acting as a simple
proxy for two other SNMP agents (running on remote systems)
might be: com2sec -Cn rem1context rem1user default
remotehost1 com2sec -Cn rem2context rem2user default
remotehost2</p>

<p>proxy -Cn rem1context -v 1 -c public remotehost1 .1.3
proxy -Cn rem2context -v 1 -c public remotehost2 .1.3 (plus
suitable access control entries).</p>

<p>The same proxy directives would also work with
(incoming) SNMPv3 requests, which can specify a context
directly. It would probably be more sensible to use contexts
of remotehost1 and remotehost2 - the names above were chosen
to indicate how these directives work together.</p>

<p>Note that the administrative settings for the proxied
request are spec- ified explicitly, and are independent of
the settings from the incoming request.</p>

<p>An alternative use for the proxy directive is to pass
part of the OID tree to another agent (either on a remote
host or listening on a dif- ferent port on the same system),
while handling the rest internally: proxy -v 1 -c public
localhost:6161 .1.3.6.1.4.1.99 This mechanism can be used to
link together two separate SNMP agents.</p>

<p>A less usual approach is to map one subtree into a
different area of the overall MIB tree (either locally or on
a remote system): # uses SNMPv3 to access the MIB tree
.1.3.6.1.2.1.1 on remotehost_ # and maps this to the local
tree .1.3.6.1.3.10 proxy -v 3 -l noAuthNoPriv -u user
remotehost .1.3.6.1.3.10 .1.3.6.1.2.1.1</p>

<p>SMUX Sub-Agents smuxsocket 127.0.0.1 smuxpeer
.1.3.6.1.2.1.14 ospf_pass</p>

<p>AgentX Sub-Agents The Net-SNMP agent could be configured
to operate as an AgentX master agent (listening on a
non-standard named socket, and running using the access
privileges defined earlier), using: master agentx
agentXSocket /tmp/agentx/master agentXPerms 0660 0550 nobody
snmp A sub-agent wishing to connect to this master agent
would need the same agentXSocket directive, or the
equivalent code:
netsnmp_ds_set_string(NETSNMP_DS_APPLICATION_ID,
NETSNMP_DS_AGENT_X_SOCKET,
&quot;/tmp/agentx/master&quot;);</p>

<p>A loopback networked AgentX configuration could be set
up using: agentXSocket tcp:localhost:705 agentXTimeout 5
agentXRetries 2 on the master side, and: agentXSocket
tcp:localhost:705 agentXTimeout 10 agentXRetries 1
agentXPingInterval 600 on the client.</p>

<p>Note that the timeout and retry settings can be
asymmetric for the two directions, and the sub-agent can
poll the master agent at regular intervals (600s = every 10
minutes), to ensure the connection is still working.</p>
