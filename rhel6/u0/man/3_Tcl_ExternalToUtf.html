<p>const char * Tcl_GetDefaultEncodingDir(void)</p>

<p>void Tcl_SetDefaultEncodingDir(path)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS Tcl_Interp *interp (in) Interpreter to use for
error reporting, or NULL if no error reporting is
desired.</p>

<p>const char *name (in) Name of encoding to load.</p>

<p>Tcl_Encoding encoding (in) The encoding to query, free,
or use for converting text. If encoding is NULL, the current
system encoding is used.</p>

<p>Tcl_Obj *objPtr (in) Name of encoding to get token
for.</p>

<p>Tcl_Encoding *encodingPtr (out) Points to storage where
encoding token is to be written.</p>

<p>const char *src (in) For the Tcl_ExternalToUtf
functions, an array of bytes in the spec- ified encoding
that are to be converted to UTF-8. For the Tcl_UtfToExternal
and Tcl_WinUtfToTChar functions, an array of UTF-8
characters to be converted to the specified encod- ing.</p>

<p>const TCHAR *tsrc (in) An array of Windows TCHAR
characters to convert to UTF-8.</p>

<p>int srcLen (in) Length of src or tsrc in bytes. If the
length is negative, the encoding-specific length of the
string is used.</p>

<p>Tcl_DString *dstPtr (out) Pointer to an unini- tialized
or free Tcl_DString in which the converted result will be
stored.</p>

<p>int flags (in) Various flag bits OR- ed together.
TCL_ENCODING_START signifies that the source buffer is the
first block in a (potentially multi- block) input stream,
telling the conver- sion routine to reset to an initial
state and perform any ini- tialization that needs to occur
before the first byte is converted. TCL_ENCOD- ING_END
signifies that the source buffer is the last block in a
(poten- tially multi-block) input stream, telling the
conversion rou- tine to perform any finalization that needs
to occur after the last byte is con- verted and then to
reset to an initial state. TCL_ENCOD- ING_STOPONERROR sig-
nifies that the con- version routine should return immedi-
ately upon reading a source character that does not exist in
the target encoding; oth- erwise a default fallback
character will automatically be substituted.</p>

<p>Tcl_EncodingState *statePtr (in/out) Used when
converting a (generally long or indefinite length) byte
stream in a piece-by-piece fash- ion. The conversion routine
stores its current state in *statePtr after src (the buffer
contain- ing the current piece) has been con- verted; that
state information must be passed back when con- verting the
next piece of the stream so the conversion routine knows
what state it was in when it left off at the end of the last
piece. May be NULL, in which case the value specified for
flags is ignored and the source buffer is assumed to contain
the complete string to convert.</p>

<p>char *dst (out) Buffer in which the converted result
will be stored. No more than dstLen bytes will be stored in
dst.</p>

<p>int dstLen (in) The maximum length of the output buffer
dst in bytes.</p>

<p>int *srcReadPtr (out) Filled with the num- ber of bytes
from src that were actually converted. This may be less than
the original source length if there was a problem converting
some source charac- ters. May be NULL.</p>

<p>int *dstWrotePtr (out) Filled with the num- ber of bytes
that were actually stored in the output buffer as a result
of the conversion. May be NULL.</p>

<p>int *dstCharsPtr (out) Filled with the num- ber of
characters that correspond to the number of bytes stored in
the output buffer. May be NULL.</p>

<p>Tcl_DString *bufPtr (out) Storage for the pre- scribed
system encod- ing name.</p>

<p>const Tcl_EncodingType *typePtr (in) Structure that
defines a new type of encoding.</p>

<p>Tcl_Obj *searchPath (in) List of filesystem directories
in which to search for encod- ing data files.</p>

<p>const char *path (in) A path to the loca- tion of the
encoding file.

<p>INTRODUCTION These routines convert between Tcl s
internal character representation, UTF-8, and character
representations used by various operating systems or file
systems, such as Unicode, ASCII, or Shift-JIS. When
operating on strings, such as such as obtaining the names of
files or displaying characters using international fonts,
the strings must be translated into one or possibly multiple
formats that the various system calls can use. For instance,
on a Japanese Unix workstation, a user might obtain a
filename represented in the EUC-JP file encoding and then
translate the characters to the jisx0208 font encoding in
order to display the filename in a Tk widget. The purpose of
the encoding package is to help bridge the translation gap.
UTF-8 provides an intermediate stag- ing ground for all the
various encodings. In the example above, text would be
translated into UTF-8 from whatever file encoding the
operat- ing system is using. Then it would be translated
from UTF-8 into what- ever font encoding the display
routines require.</p>

<p>Some basic encodings are compiled into Tcl. Others can
be defined by the user or dynamically loaded from encoding
files in a platform-inde- pendent manner.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Tcl_GetEncoding finds an encoding given its
name. The name may refer to a built-in Tcl encoding, a
user-defined encoding registered by call- ing
Tcl_CreateEncoding, or a dynamically-loadable encoding file.
The return value is a token that represents the encoding and
can be used in subsequent calls to procedures such as
Tcl_GetEncodingName, Tcl_FreeEn- coding, and
Tcl_UtfToExternal. If the name did not refer to any known or
loadable encoding, NULL is returned and an error message is
returned in interp.</p>

<p>The encoding package maintains a database of all
encodings currently in use. The first time name is seen,
Tcl_GetEncoding returns an encoding with a reference count
of 1. If the same name is requested further times, then the
reference count for that encoding is incremented with- out
the overhead of allocating a new encoding and all its
associated data structures.</p>

<p>When an encoding is no longer needed, Tcl_FreeEncoding
should be called to release it. When an encoding is no
longer in use anywhere (i.e., it has been freed as many
times as it has been gotten) Tcl_FreeEncoding will release
all storage the encoding was using and delete it from the
database.</p>

<p>Tcl_GetEncodingFromObj treats the string representation
of objPtr as an encoding name, and finds an encoding with
that name, just as Tcl_GetEn- coding does. When an encoding
is found, it is cached within the objPtr value for future
reference, the Tcl_Encoding token is written to the storage
pointed to by encodingPtr, and the value TCL_OK is returned.
If no such encoding is found, the value TCL_ERROR is
returned, and no writing to *encodingPtr takes place. Just
as with Tcl_GetEncoding, the caller should call
Tcl_FreeEncoding on the resulting encoding token when that
token will no longer be used.</p>

<p>Tcl_ExternalToUtfDString converts a source buffer src
from the speci- fied encoding into UTF-8. The converted
bytes are stored in dstPtr, which is then null-terminated.
The caller should eventually call Tcl_DStringFree to free
any information stored in dstPtr. When con- verting, if any
of the characters in the source buffer cannot be repre-
sented in the target encoding, a default fallback character
will be used. The return value is a pointer to the value
stored in the DString.</p>

<p>Tcl_ExternalToUtf converts a source buffer src from the
specified encoding into UTF-8. Up to srcLen bytes are
converted from the source buffer and up to dstLen converted
bytes are stored in dst. In all cases, *srcReadPtr is filled
with the number of bytes that were suc- cessfully converted
from src and *dstWrotePtr is filled with the corre- sponding
number of bytes that were stored in dst. The return value is
one of the following:</p>

<p>TCL_OK All bytes of src were converted.</p>

<p>TCL_CONVERT_NOSPACE The destination buffer was not large
enough for all of the con- verted data; as many characters
as could fit were converted though.</p>

<p>TCL_CONVERT_MULTIBYTE The last few bytes in the source
buffer were the beginning of a multibyte sequence, but more
bytes were needed to complete this sequence. A subsequent
call to the conversion routine should pass a buffer
containing the unconverted bytes that remained in src plus
some further bytes from the source stream to properly
convert the for- merly split-up multibyte sequence.</p>

<p>TCL_CONVERT_SYNTAX The source buffer contained an
invalid character sequence. This may occur if the input
stream has been damaged or if the input encod- ing method
was misidentified.</p>

<p>TCL_CONVERT_UNKNOWN The source buffer contained a char-
acter that could not be represented in the target encoding
and TCL_ENCODING_STOPONERROR was speci- fied.</p>

<p>Tcl_UtfToExternalDString converts a source buffer src
from UTF-8 into the specified encoding. The converted bytes
are stored in dstPtr, which is then terminated with the
appropriate encoding-specific null. The caller should
eventually call Tcl_DStringFree to free any informa- tion
stored in dstPtr. When converting, if any of the characters
in the source buffer cannot be represented in the target
encoding, a default fallback character will be used. The
return value is a pointer to the value stored in the
DString.</p>

<p>Tcl_UtfToExternal converts a source buffer src from
UTF-8 into the specified encoding. Up to srcLen bytes are
converted from the source buffer and up to dstLen converted
bytes are stored in dst. In all cases, *srcReadPtr is filled
with the number of bytes that were suc- cessfully converted
from src and *dstWrotePtr is filled with the corre- sponding
number of bytes that were stored in dst. The return values
are the same as the return values for Tcl_ExternalToUtf.</p>

<p>Tcl_WinUtfToTChar and Tcl_WinTCharToUtf are Windows-only
convenience functions for converting between UTF-8 and
Windows strings. On Windows 95 (as with the Unix operating
system), all strings exchanged between Tcl and the operating
system are char based. On Windows NT, some strings exchanged
between Tcl and the operating system are char ori- ented
while others are in Unicode. By convention, in Windows a
TCHAR is a character in the ANSI code page on Windows 95 and
a Unicode char- acter on Windows NT.</p>

<p>If you planned to use the same char based interfaces on
both Windows 95 and Windows NT, you could use
Tcl_UtfToExternal and Tcl_ExternalToUtf (or their
Tcl_DString equivalents) with an encoding of NULL (the
current system encoding). On the other hand, if you planned
to use the Unicode interface when running on Windows NT and
the char interfaces when running on Windows 95, you would
have to perform the following type of test over and over in
your program (as repre- sented in pseudo-code): if (running
NT) { encoding &lt;- Tcl_GetEncoding(&quot;unicode&quot;);
nativeBuffer &lt;- Tcl_UtfToExternal(encoding, utfBuffer);
Tcl_FreeEncoding(encoding); } else { nativeBuffer &lt;-
Tcl_UtfToExternal(NULL, utfBuffer); } Tcl_WinUtfToTChar and
Tcl_WinTCharToUtf automatically handle this test and use the
proper encoding based on the current operating system.
Tcl_WinUtfToTChar returns a pointer to a TCHAR string, and
Tcl_WinTCharToUtf expects a TCHAR string pointer as the src
string. Otherwise, these functions behave identically to
Tcl_UtfToExternalD- String and Tcl_ExternalToUtfDString.</p>

<p>Tcl_GetEncodingName is roughly the inverse of
Tcl_GetEncoding. Given an encoding, the return value is the
name argument that was used to create the encoding. The
string returned by Tcl_GetEncodingName is only guaranteed to
persist until the encoding is deleted. The caller must not
modify this string.</p>

<p>Tcl_SetSystemEncoding sets the default encoding that
should be used whenever the user passes a NULL value for the
encoding argument to any of the other encoding functions. If
name is NULL, the system encoding is reset to the default
system encoding, binary. If the name did not refer to any
known or loadable encoding, TCL_ERROR is returned and an
error message is left in interp. Otherwise, this procedure
increments the reference count of the new system encoding,
decrements the refer- ence count of the old system encoding,
and returns TCL_OK.</p>

<p>Tcl_GetEncodingNameFromEnvironment provides a means for
the Tcl library to report the encoding name it believes to
be the correct one to use as the system encoding, based on
system calls and examination of the envi- ronment suitable
for the platform. It accepts bufPtr, a pointer to an
uninitialized or freed Tcl_DString and writes the encoding
name to it. The Tcl_DStringValue is returned.</p>

<p>Tcl_GetEncodingNames sets the interp result to a list
consisting of the names of all the encodings that are
currently defined or can be dynami- cally loaded, searching
the encoding path specified by Tcl_SetDefault- EncodingDir.
This procedure does not ensure that the dynamically-load-
able encoding files contain valid data, but merely that they
exist.</p>

<p>Tcl_CreateEncoding defines a new encoding and registers
the C proce- dures that are called back to convert between
the encoding and UTF-8. Encodings created by
Tcl_CreateEncoding are thereafter visible in the database
used by Tcl_GetEncoding. Just as with the Tcl_GetEncoding
procedure, the return value is a token that represents the
encoding and can be used in subsequent calls to other
encoding functions. Tcl_Cre- ateEncoding returns an encoding
with a reference count of 1. If an encoding with the
specified name already exists, then its entry in the
database is replaced with the new encoding; the token for
the old encoding will remain valid and continue to behave as
before, but users of the new token will now call the new
encoding procedures.</p>

<p>The typePtr argument to Tcl_CreateEncoding contains
information about the name of the encoding and the
procedures that will be called to con- vert between this
encoding and UTF-8. It is defined as follows:</p>

<p>typedef struct Tcl_EncodingType { const char
*encodingName; Tcl_EncodingConvertProc *toUtfProc;
Tcl_EncodingConvertProc *fromUtfProc; Tcl_EncodingFreeProc
*freeProc; ClientData clientData; int nullSize; }
Tcl_EncodingType;</p>

<p>The encodingName provides a string name for the
encoding, by which it can be referred in other procedures
such as Tcl_GetEncoding. The toUtfProc refers to a callback
procedure to invoke to convert text from this encoding into
UTF-8. The fromUtfProc refers to a callback procedure to
invoke to convert text from UTF-8 into this encoding. The
freeProc refers to a callback procedure to invoke when this
encoding is deleted. The freeProc field may be NULL. The
clientData contains an arbitrary one-word value passed to
toUtfProc, fromUtfProc, and freeProc whenever they are
called. Typically, this is a pointer to a data structure
containing encoding-specific information that can be used by
the callback procedures. For instance, two very similar
encodings such as ascii and macRoman may use the same
callback procedure, but use dif- ferent values of clientData
to control its behavior. The nullSize specifies the number
of zero bytes that signify end-of-string in this encoding.
It must be 1 (for single-byte or multi-byte encodings like
ASCII or Shift-JIS) or 2 (for double-byte encodings like
Unicode). Constant-sized encodings with 3 or more bytes per
character (such as CNS11643) are not accepted.</p>

<p>The callback procedures toUtfProc and fromUtfProc should
match the type Tcl_EncodingConvertProc:</p>

<p>typedef int Tcl_EncodingConvertProc( ClientData
clientData, const char *src, int srcLen, int flags,
Tcl_EncodingState *statePtr, char *dst, int dstLen, int
*srcReadPtr, int *dstWrotePtr, int *dstCharsPtr);</p>

<p>The toUtfProc and fromUtfProc procedures are called by
the Tcl_ExternalToUtf or Tcl_UtfToExternal family of
functions to perform the actual conversion. The clientData
parameter to these procedures is the same as the clientData
field specified to Tcl_CreateEncoding when the encoding was
created. The remaining arguments to the callback pro-
cedures are the same as the arguments, documented at the
top, to Tcl_ExternalToUtf or Tcl_UtfToExternal, with the
following exceptions. If the srcLen argument to one of those
high-level functions is nega- tive, the value passed to the
callback procedure will be the appropri- ate
encoding-specific string length of src. If any of the
srcReadPtr, dstWrotePtr, or dstCharsPtr arguments to one of
the high-level func- tions is NULL, the corresponding value
passed to the callback procedure will be a non-NULL
location.</p>

<p>The callback procedure freeProc, if non-NULL, should
match the type Tcl_EncodingFreeProc: typedef void
Tcl_EncodingFreeProc( ClientData clientData);</p>

<p>This freeProc function is called when the encoding is
deleted. The clientData parameter is the same as the
clientData field specified to Tcl_CreateEncoding when the
encoding was created.</p>

<p>Tcl_GetEncodingSearchPath and Tcl_SetEncodingSearchPath
are called to access and set the list of filesystem
directories searched for encoding data files.</p>

<p>The value returned by Tcl_GetEncodingSearchPath is the
value stored by the last successful call to
Tcl_SetEncodingSearchPath. If no calls to
Tcl_SetEncodingSearchPath have occurred, Tcl will compute an
initial value based on the environment. There is one
encoding search path for the entire process, shared by all
threads in the process.</p>

<p>Tcl_SetEncodingSearchPath stores searchPath and returns
TCL_OK, unless searchPath is not a valid Tcl list, which
causes TCL_ERROR to be returned. The elements of searchPath
are not verified as existing readable filesystem
directories. When searching for encoding data files takes
place, and non-existent or non-readable filesystem directo-
ries on the searchPath are silently ignored.</p>

<p>Tcl_GetDefaultEncodingDir and Tcl_SetDefaultEncodingDir
are obsolete interfaces best replaced with calls to
Tcl_GetEncodingSearchPath and Tcl_SetEncodingSearchPath.
They are called to access and set the first element of the
searchPath list. Since Tcl searches searchPath for encoding
data files in list order, these routines establish the
default directory in which to find encoding data files.</p>

<p>ENCODING FILES Space would prohibit precompiling into
Tcl every possible encoding algorithm, so many encodings are
stored on disk as dynamically-loadable encoding files. This
behavior also allows the user to create addi- tional
encoding files that can be loaded using the same mechanism.
These encoding files contain information about the tables
and/or escape sequences used to map between an external
encoding and Unicode. The external encoding may consist of
single-byte, multi-byte, or double- byte characters.</p>

<p>Each dynamically-loadable encoding is represented as a
text file. The initial line of the file, beginning with a #
symbol, is a comment that provides a human-readable
description of the file. The next line identifies the type
of encoding file. It can be one of the following
letters:</p>

<p>[1] S A single-byte encoding, where one character is
always one byte long in the encoding. An example is
iso8859-1, used by many European languages.</p>

<p>[2] D A double-byte encoding, where one character is
always two bytes long in the encoding. An example is big5,
used for Chinese text.</p>

<p>[3] M A multi-byte encoding, where one character may be
either one or two bytes long. Certain bytes are lead bytes,
indicating that another byte must follow and that together
the two bytes repre- sent one character. Other bytes are not
lead bytes and repre- sent themselves. An example is
shiftjis, used by many Japanese computers.</p>

<p>[4] E An escape-sequence encoding, specifying that
certain sequences of bytes do not represent characters, but
commands that describe how following bytes should be
interpreted.</p>

<p>The rest of the lines in the file depend on the
type.</p>

<p>Cases [1], [2], and [3] are collectively referred to as
table-based encoding files. The lines in a table-based
encoding file are in the same format as this example taken
from the shiftjis encoding (this is not the complete file):
# Encoding file: shiftjis, multi-byte M 003F 0 40 00

<p>The third line of the file is three numbers. The first
number is the fallback character (in base 16) to use when
converting from UTF-8 to this encoding. The second number is
a 1 if this file represents the encoding for a symbol font,
or 0 otherwise. The last number (in base 10) is how many
pages of data follow.</p>

<p>Subsequent lines in the example above are pages that
describe how to map from the encoding into 2-byte Unicode.
The first line in a page identifies the page number.
Following it are 256 double-byte numbers, arranged as 16
rows of 16 numbers. Given a character in the encoding, the
high byte of that character is used to select which page,
and the low byte of that character is used as an index to
select one of the double-byte numbers in that page - the
value obtained being the corre- sponding Unicode character.
By examination of the example above, one can see that the
characters 0x7E and 0x8163 in shiftjis map to 203E and 2026
in Unicode, respectively.</p>

<p>Following the first page will be all the other pages,
each in the same format as the first: one number identifying
the page followed by 256 double-byte Unicode characters. If
a character in the encoding maps to the Unicode character
0000, it means that the character does not actu- ally exist.
If all characters on a page would map to 0000, that page can
be omitted.</p>

<p>Case [4] is the escape-sequence encoding file. The lines
in an this type of file are in the same format as this
example taken from the iso2022-jp encoding: # Encoding file:
iso2022-jp, escape-driven E init {} final {} iso8859-1 b(B
jis0201 b(J jis0208 b$@ jis0208 b$B jis0212 b$(D gb2312 b$A
ksc5601 b$(C</p>

<p>In the file, the first column represents an option and
the second col- umn is the associated value. init is a
string to emit or expect before the first character is
converted, while final is a string to emit or expect after
the last character. All other options are names of table-
based encodings; the associated value is the escape-sequence
that marks that encoding. Tcl syntax is used for the values;
in the above example, for instance, {} represents the empty
string and 1b rep- resents character 27.</p>

<p>When Tcl_GetEncoding encounters an encoding name that
has not been loaded, it attempts to load an encoding file
called name.enc from the encoding subdirectory of each
directory that Tcl searches for its script library. If the
encoding file exists, but is malformed, an error message
will be left in interp.</p>
