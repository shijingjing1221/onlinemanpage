<p>HEXDUMP(1) BSD General Commands Manual HEXDUMP(1)</p>

<p>NAME hexdump - ascii, decimal, hexadecimal, octal
dump</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS hexdump [-bcCdovx] [-e format_string] [-f
format_file] [-n length] [-s skip] file ...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The hexdump utility is a filter which
displays the specified files, or the standard input, if no
files are specified, in a user specified for- mat.</p>

<p>The options are as follows:</p>

<p>-b One-byte octal display. Display the input offset in
hexadec- imal, followed by sixteen space-separated, three
column, zero-filled, bytes of input data, in octal, per
line.</p>

<p>-c One-byte character display. Display the input offset
in hex- adecimal, followed by sixteen space-separated, three
column, space-filled, characters of input data per line.</p>

<p>-C Canonical hex+ASCII display. Display the input offset
in hexadecimal, followed by sixteen space-separated, two
column, hexadecimal bytes, followed by the same sixteen
bytes in %_p format enclosed in | characters.</p>

<p>-d Two-byte decimal display. Display the input offset in
hex- adecimal, followed by eight space-separated, five
column, zero-filled, two-byte units of input data, in
unsigned deci- mal, per line.</p>

<p>-e format_string Specify a format string to be used for
displaying data.</p>

<p>-f format_file Specify a file that contains one or more
newline separated format strings. Empty lines and lines
whose first non-blank character is a hash mark (#) are
ignored.</p>

<p>-n length Interpret only length bytes of input.</p>

<p>-o Two-byte octal display. Display the input offset in
hexadec- imal, followed by eight space-separated, six
column, zero- filled, two byte quantities of input data, in
octal, per line.</p>

<p>-s offset Skip offset bytes from the beginning of the
input. By default, offset is interpreted as a decimal
number. With a leading 0x or 0X, offset is interpreted as a
hexadecimal num- ber, otherwise, with a leading 0, offset is
interpreted as an octal number. Appending the character b,
k, or m to offset causes it to be interpreted as a multiple
of 512, 1024, or 1048576, respectively.</p>

<p>-v The -v option causes hexdump to display all input
data. Without the -v option, any number of groups of output
lines, which would be identical to the immediately preceding
group of output lines (except for the input offsets), are
replaced with a line comprised of a single asterisk.</p>

<p>-x Two-byte hexadecimal display. Display the input
offset in hexadecimal, followed by eight, space separated,
four column, zero-filled, two-byte quantities of input data,
in hexadeci- mal, per line.</p>

<p>For each input file, hexdump sequentially copies the
input to standard output, transforming the data according to
the format strings specified by the -e and -f options, in
the order that they were specified.</p>

<p>Formats A format string contains any number of format
units, separated by whites- pace. A format unit contains up
to three items: an iteration count, a byte count, and a
format.</p>

<p>The iteration count is an optional positive integer,
which defaults to one. Each format is applied iteration
count times.</p>

<p>The byte count is an optional positive integer. If
specified it defines the number of bytes to be interpreted
by each iteration of the format.</p>

<p>If an iteration count and/or a byte count is specified,
a single slash must be placed after the iteration count
and/or before the byte count to disambiguate them. Any
whitespace before or after the slash is ignored.</p>

<p>The format is required and must be surrounded by double
quote (&quot; &quot;) marks. It is interpreted as a
fprintf-style format string (see fprintf(3)), with the
following exceptions:</p>

<p>&middot; An asterisk (*) may not be used as a field
width or precision.</p>

<p>&middot; A byte count or field precision is required for
each s con- version character (unlike the fprintf(3) default
which prints the entire string if the precision is
unspecified).</p>

<p>&middot; The conversion characters h, l, n, p and q are
not supported.</p>

<p>&middot; The single character escape sequences described
in the C stan- dard are supported:</p>

<p>NUL &lt;alert character&gt; &lt; f o r m
&lt;backspace&gt; - f e e d &gt; &lt;newline&gt;
&lt;carriage return&gt; &lt;tab&gt; &lt;vertical tab&gt;
Hexdump also supports the following additional conversion
strings:</p>

<p>_a[dox] Display the input offset, cumulative across
input files, of the next byte to be displayed. The appended
characters d, o, and x specify the display base as decimal,
octal or hexadeci- mal respectively.</p>

<p>_A[dox] Identical to the _a conversion string except
that it is only performed once, when all of the input data
has been pro- cessed.</p>

<p>_c Output characters in the default character set.
Nonprinting characters are displayed in three character,
zero-padded octal, except for those representable by
standard escape notation (see above), which are displayed as
two character strings.</p>

<p>_p Output characters in the default character set.
Nonprinting characters are displayed as a single ..</p>

<p>_u Output US ASCII characters, with the exception that
control characters are displayed using the following,
lower-case, names. Characters greater than 0xff,
hexadecimal, are dis- played as hexadecimal strings.</p>

<p>000 nul 001 soh 002 stx 003 etx 004 eot 005 enq 006 ack
007 bel 008 bs 009 ht 00A lf 00B vt 00C ff 00D cr 00E so 00F
si 010 dle 011 dc1 012 dc2 013 dc3 014 dc4 015 nak 016 syn
017 etb 018 can 019 em 01A sub 01B esc 01C fs 01D gs 01E rs
01F us 0FF del</p>

<p>The default and supported byte counts for the conversion
characters are as follows:</p>

<p>%_c, %_p, %_u, %c One byte counts only.</p>

<p>%u, %X, %x, Four byte default, one, two and four byte
counts supported.</p>

<p>%G, %g,%f, Eight byte default, four byte counts
supported.</p>

<p>The amount of data interpreted by each format string is
the sum of the data required by each format unit, which is
the iteration count times the byte count, or the iteration
count times the number of bytes required by the format if
the byte count is not specified.</p>

<p>The input is manipulated in blocks, where a block is
defined as the largest amount of data specified by any
format string. Format strings interpreting less than an
input blocks worth of data, whose last format unit both
interprets some number of bytes and does not have a
specified iteration count, have the iteration count
incremented until the entire input block has been processed
or there is not enough data remaining in the block to
satisfy the format string.</p>

<p>If, either as a result of user specification or hexdump
modifying the iteration count as described above, an
iteration count is greater than one, no trailing whitespace
characters are output during the last itera- tion.</p>

<p>It is an error to specify a byte count as well as
multiple conversion characters or strings unless all but one
of the conversion characters or strings is _a or _A.</p>

<p>If, as a result of the specification of the -n option or
end-of-file being reached, input data only partially
satisfies a format string, the input block is zero-padded
sufficiently to display all available data (i.e. any format
units overlapping the end of data will display some num- ber
of the zero bytes).</p>

<p>Further output by such format strings is replaced by an
equivalent number of spaces. An equivalent number of spaces
is defined as the number of spaces output by an s conversion
character with the same field width and precision as the
original conversion character or conversion string but with
any +, , # conversion flag characters removed, and referenc-
ing a NULL string.</p>

<p>If no format strings are specified, the default display
is equivalent to specifying the -x option.</p>

<p>hexdump exits 0 on success and &gt;0 if an error
occurred.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Display the input in perusal format:</p>

<p>&quot;%06.6_ao &quot; 12/1 &quot;%3_u &quot;
&quot;&quot; &quot;%_p &quot; &quot;0</p>

<p>Implement the -x option:</p>

<p>&quot;%07.7_Ax0 &quot;%07.7_ax &quot; 8/2 &quot;%04x
&quot; &quot;0</p>

<p>STANDARDS The hexdump utility is expected to be IEEE Std
1003.2 ( POSIX.2) compat- ible.</p>

<p>AVAILABILITY The hexdump command is part of the
util-linux-ng package and is available from
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux-ng/.</p>
