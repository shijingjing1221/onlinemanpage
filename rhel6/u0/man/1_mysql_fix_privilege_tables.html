<p>MYSQL_FIX_PRIVILE(1) MySQL Database System
MYSQL_FIX_PRIVILE(1)</p>

<p>NAME mysql_fix_privilege_tables - upgrade MySQL system
tables</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS mysql_fix_privilege_tables
--password=root_password</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Note In MySQL 5.1.7,
mysql_fix_privilege_tables was superseded by mysql_upgrade,
which should be used instead. See mysql_upgrade(1).</p>

<p>Some releases of MySQL introduce changes to the
structure of the system tables in the mysql database to add
new privileges or support new features. When you update to a
new version of MySQL, you should update your system tables
as well to make sure that their structure is up to date.
Otherwise, there might be capabilities that you cannot take
advantage of.</p>

<p>mysql_fix_privilege_tables is an older script that
previously was used to uprade the system tables in the mysql
database after a MySQL upgrade.</p>

<p>Before running mysql_fix_privilege_tables, make a backup
of your mysql database.</p>

<p>On Unix or Unix-like systems, update the system tables
by running the mysql_fix_privilege_tables script:</p>

<p>shell&gt; mysql_fix_privilege_tables</p>

<p>You must run this script while the server is running. It
attempts to connect to the server running on the local host
as root. If your root account requires a password, indicate
the password on the command line like this:</p>

<p>shell&gt; mysql_fix_privilege_tables
--password=root_password</p>

<p>The mysql_fix_privilege_tables script performs any
actions necessary to convert your system tables to the
current format. You might see some Duplicate column name
warnings as it runs; you can ignore them.</p>

<p>After running the script, stop the server and restart it
so that any changes made to the system tables take
effect.</p>

<p>On Windows systems, MySQL distributions include a
mysql_fix_privilege_tables.sql SQL script that you can run
using the mysql client. For example, if your MySQL
installation is located at C:Program FilesSQLSQL Server 5.1,
the commands look like this:</p>

<p>C:&gt; cd &quot;CProgram FileMySQMySQL Server 5.1&quot;
C:&gt; bimysql -u root -p mysql mysql&gt; SOURCE
share/mysql_fix_privilege_tables.sql</p>

<p>Note Prior to version 5.1.17, the
mysql_fix_privilege_tables.sql script is found in the
scripts directory.</p>

<p>The mysql command will prompt you for the root password;
enter it when prompted.</p>

<p>If your installation is located in some other directory,
adjust the path names appropriately.</p>

<p>As with the Unix procedure, you might see some Duplicate
column name warnings as mysql processes the statements in
the mysql_fix_privilege_tables.sql script; you can ignore
them.</p>

<p>After running the script, stop the server and restart
it.</p>
