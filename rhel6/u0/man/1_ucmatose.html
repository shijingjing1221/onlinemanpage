<p>NAME ucmatose - RDMA CM connection and simple ping-pong
test.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ucmatose [-s server_address] [-b bind_address]
[-c connections] [-C message_count] [-S message_size]
ucmatose -s server_address [-b bind_address] [-c
connections] [-C message_count] [-S message_size] [-t
tos]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Establishes a set of reliable RDMA
connections between two nodes using the librdmacm,
optionally transfers data between the nodes, then dis-
connects.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -s server_address The network name or IP address
of the server system listening for connections. The used
name or address must route over an RDMA device. This option
must be specified by the client.</p>

<p>-b bind_address The local network address to bind
to.</p>

<p>-c connections The number of connections to establish
between the client and server. (default 1)</p>

<p>-C message_count The number of messages to transfer over
each connection. (default 10)</p>

<p>-S message_size The size of each message transferred, in
bytes. (default 100)</p>

<p>-t tos Indicates the type of service used for the
communication. Type of service is implementation dependent
based on subnet configu- ration.</p>

<p>-m Tests event channel migration. Migrates all
communication iden- tifiers to a different event channel for
disconnect events.</p>

<p>NOTES Basic usage is to start ucmatose on a server
system, then run ucmatose -s server_name on a client
system.</p>

<p>Because this test maps RDMA resources to userspace,
users must ensure that they have available system resources
and permissions. See the libibverbs README file for
additional details.</p>
