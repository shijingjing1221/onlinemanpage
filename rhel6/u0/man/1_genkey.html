<p>NAME genkey - generate SSL certificates and certificate
requests</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS genkey [--test] [--days count] [[--genreq] |
[--makeca] | [--nss] | [--renew] | [--cacert]]
{hostname}</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION genkey is an interactive command-line tool
which can be used to generate SSL certificates or
Certificate Signing Requests (CSR). Generated certificates
are stored in the directory /etc/pki/tls/certs/, and the
corresponding private key in /etc/pki/tls/private/.</p>

<p>When using mod_nss the private key is stored in the nss
database. Consult the nss.conf file in /etc/httpd/conf.d/
for the location of the database.</p>

<p>genkey will prompt for the size of key desired; whether
or not to generate a CSR; whether or not an encrypted
private key is desired; the certificate subject DN
details.</p>

<p>genkey generates random data for the private key using
the truerand library and also by prompting the user for
entry of random text.</p>

<p>nss indicates that mod_nss database should be used to
store keys and certificates.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --makeca Generate a Certificate Authority
keypair and certificate.</p>

<p>--genreq Generate a Certificate Signing Request for an
existing private key, which can be submitted to a CA (for
example, for renewal).</p>

<p>--renew Used with --genreq to indicate a renewal, the
existing keypair will be used. Certs and keys must reside in
the nss database, therefore --nss is also required. Pem file
based cert renewal is not currently supported.</p>

<p>--cacert The certificate renewal is for a CA, needed for
openssl certs only.</p>

<p>--days count When generating a self-signed certificate,
specify that the number of days for which the certificate is
valid be count rather than the default value of 30.</p>

<p>--test For test purposes only; omit the slow process of
generating random data.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES The following example will create a self-signed
certificate and private key for the hostname
www.example.com:</p>

<p># genkey --days 120 www.example.com</p>

<p>The following example will create a self-signed
certificate and private key for the hostname
www.nssexample.com which will be stored in cert and key in
the nss database. If no nickname is given the tool will
extract it from mod_nss&acute;s nss configuration file.</p>

<p># genkey --days --nss 120 www.nssexample.com</p>

<p>The following example will generate a certificate
signing request for a new mod_nss style cert specified by
its nickname, Server-Cert:</p>

<p># genkey --genreq --nss --days 120 Server-Cert</p>

<p>The following example will generate a certificate
signing request for the renewal of an existing mod_nss cert
specified by its nickname, Server-Cert:</p>

<p># genkey --genreq --renew --nss --days 120
Server-Cert</p>
