<p>XkbSelectEvents(3) XKB FUNCTIONS XkbSelectEvents(3)</p>

<p>NAME XkbSelectEvents - Selects and / or deselects for
delivery of one or more Xkb events and has them delivered
under all conditions</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS Bool XkbSelectEvents (Display *display,
unsigned int device_spec, unsigned long int bits_to_change,
unsigned long int val- ues_for_bits);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS display connection to the X server</p>

<p>device_spec device ID, or XkbUseCoreKbd</p>

<p>bits_to_change determines events to be selected /
deselected</p>

<p>values_for_bits 1=&gt;select, 0-&gt;deselect; for events
in bits_to_change</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Xkb events are selected using an event mask,
much the same as normal core X events are selected. However,
unlike selecting core X events, where you must specify the
selection status (on or off) for all possi- ble event types
whenever you wish to change the selection criteria for any
one event, Xkb allows you to restrict the specification to
only the event types you wish to change. This means that you
do not need to remember the event selection values for all
possible types each time you want to change one of them.</p>

<p>Many Xkb event types are generated under several
different circum- stances. When selecting to receive an Xkb
event, you may specify either that you want it delivered
under all circumstances, or that you want it delivered only
for a subset of the possible circumstances.</p>

<p>You can also deselect an event type that was previously
selected for, using the same granularity.</p>

<p>Xkb provides two functions to select and deselect
delivery of Xkb events. XkbSelectEvents allows you to select
or deselect delivery of more than one Xkb event type at
once. Events selected using XkbSe- lectEvents are delivered
to your program under all circumstances that generate the
events. To restrict delivery of an event to a subset of the
conditions under which it occurs, use XkbSelectEventDetails.
XkbSe- lectEventDetails only allows you to change the
selection conditions for a single event at a time, but it
provides a means of fine-tuning the conditions under which
the event is delivered.</p>

<p>This request changes the Xkb event selection mask for
the keyboard specified by device_spec.</p>

<p>Each Xkb event that can be selected is represented by a
bit in the bits_to_change and values_for_bits masks. Only
the event selection bits specified by the bits_to_change
parameter are affected; any unspecified bits are left
unchanged. To turn on event selection for an event, set the
bit for the event in the bits_to_change parameter and set
the cor- responding bit in the values_for_bits parameter. To
turn off event selection for an event, set the bit for the
event in the bits_to_change parameter and do not set the
corresponding bit in the values_for_bits parameter. The
valid values for both of these parameters are an inclusive
bitwise OR of the masks shown in Table 1. There is no inter-
face to return your clients current event selection mask.
Clients can- not set other clients event selection
masks.</p>

<p>The X server reports the events defined by Xkb to your
client applica- tion only if you have requested them via a
call to XkbSelectEvents or XkbSelectEventDetails. Specify
the event types in which you are inter- ested in a mask.</p>

<p>Table 1 lists the event mask constants that can be
specified with the XkbSelectEvents request and the
circumstances in which the mask should be specified.</p>

<p>Table 1 XkbSelectEvents Mask Constants
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Event Mask Value Notification Wanted
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
XkbNewKeyboardNotifyMask (1L&lt;&lt;0) Keyboard geometry
change XkbMapNotifyMask (1L&lt;&lt;1) Keyboard mapping
change XkbStateNotifyMask (1L&lt;&lt;2) Keyboard state
change XkbControlsNotifyMask (1L&lt;&lt;3) Keyboard control
change XkbIndicatorStateNotifyMask (1L&lt;&lt;4) Keyboard
indicator state change XkbIndicatorMapNotifyMask
(1L&lt;&lt;5) Keyboard indicator map change
XkbNamesNotifyMask (1L&lt;&lt;6) Keyboard name change
XkbCompatMapNotifyMask (1L&lt;&lt;7) Keyboard compat map
change XkbBellNotifyMask (1L&lt;&lt;8) Bell
XkbActionMessageMask (1L&lt;&lt;9) Action message
XkbAccessXNotifyMask (1L&lt;&lt;10) AccessX features
XkbExtensionDeviceNotifyMask (1L&lt;&lt;11) Extension device
XkbAllEventsMask (0xFFF) All Xkb events</p>

<p>If a bit is not set in the bits_to_change parameter, but
the corre- sponding bit is set in the values_for_bits
parameter, a BadMatch proto- col error results. If an
undefined bit is set in either the bits_to_change or the
values_for_bits parameter, a BadValue protocol error
results.</p>

<p>All event selection bits are initially zero for clients
using the Xkb extension. Once you set some bits, they remain
set for your client until you clear them via another call to
XkbSelectEvents.</p>

<p>XkbSelectEvents returns False if the Xkb extension has
not been initil- ialized and True otherwise.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUES True The XkbSelectEvents function returns
True if the Xkb extension has been initilialized.</p>

<p>False The XkbSelectEvents function returns False if the
Xkb extension has not been initilialized.</p>
