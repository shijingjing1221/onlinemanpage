<p>NAME gitglossary - A GIT Glossary</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS *</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION alternate object database Via the alternates
mechanism, a repository can inherit part of its object
database from another object database, which is called
&quot;alternate&quot;.</p>

<p>bare repository A bare repository is normally an
appropriately named directory with a .git suffix that does
not have a locally checked-out copy of any of the files
under revision control. That is, all of the git
administrative and control files that would normally be
present in the hidden .git sub-directory are directly
present in the repository.git directory instead, and no
other files are present and checked out. Usually publishers
of public repositories make bare repositories available.</p>

<p>blob object Untyped object, e.g. the contents of a
file.</p>

<p>branch A &quot;branch&quot; is an active line of
development. The most recent commit on a branch is referred
to as the tip of that branch. The tip of the branch is
referenced by a branch head, which moves forward as
additional development is done on the branch. A single git
repository can track an arbitrary number of branches, but
your working tree is associated with just one of them (the
&quot;current&quot; or &quot;checked out&quot; branch), and
HEAD points to that branch.</p>

<p>cache Obsolete for: index.</p>

<p>chain A list of objects, where each object in the list
contains a reference to its successor (for example, the
successor of a commit could be one of its parents).</p>

<p>changeset BitKeeper/cvsps speak for &quot;commit&quot;.
Since git does not store changes, but states, it really does
not make sense to use the term &quot;changesets&quot; with
git.</p>

<p>checkout The action of updating all or part of the
working tree with a tree object or blob from the object
database, and updating the index and HEAD if the whole
working tree has been pointed at a new branch.</p>

<p>cherry-picking In SCM jargon, &quot;cherry pick&quot;
means to choose a subset of changes out of a series of
changes (typically commits) and record them as a new series
of changes on top of a different codebase. In GIT, this is
performed by the &quot;git cherry-pick&quot; command to
extract the change introduced by an existing commit and to
record it based on the tip of the current branch as a new
commit.</p>

<p>clean A working tree is clean, if it corresponds to the
revision referenced by the current head. Also see
&quot;dirty&quot;.</p>

<p>commit As a noun: A single point in the git history; the
entire history of a project is represented as a set of
interrelated commits. The word &quot;commit&quot; is often
used by git in the same places other revision control
systems use the words &quot;revision&quot; or
&quot;version&quot;. Also used as a short hand for commit
object.</p>

<p>As a verb: The action of storing a new snapshot of the
projects state in the git history, by creating a new commit
representing the current state of the index and advancing
HEAD to point at the new commit.</p>

<p>commit object An object which contains the information
about a particular revision, such as parents, committer,
author, date and the tree object which corresponds to the
top directory of the stored revision.</p>

<p>core git Fundamental data structures and utilities of
git. Exposes only limited source code management tools.</p>

<p>DAG Directed acyclic graph. The commit objects form a
directed acyclic graph, because they have parents
(directed), and the graph of commit objects is acyclic
(there is no chain which begins and ends with the same
object).</p>

<p>dangling object An unreachable object which is not
reachable even from other unreachable objects; a dangling
object has no references to it from any reference or object
in the repository.</p>

<p>detached HEAD Normally the HEAD stores the name of a
branch. However, git also allows you to check out an
arbitrary commit that isn t necessarily the tip of any
particular branch. In this case HEAD is said to be
&quot;detached&quot;.</p>

<p>dircache You are waaaaay behind. See index.</p>

<p>directory The list you get with &quot;ls&quot; :-)</p>

<p>dirty A working tree is said to be &quot;dirty&quot; if
it contains modifications which have not been committed to
the current branch.</p>

<p>ent Favorite synonym to &quot;tree-ish&quot; by some
total geeks. See
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ent_(Middle-earth) for an
in-depth explanation. Avoid this term, not to confuse
people.</p>

<p>evil merge An evil merge is a merge that introduces
changes that do not appear in any parent.</p>

<p>fast-forward A fast-forward is a special type of merge
where you have a revision and you are &quot;merging&quot;
another branch&acute;s changes that happen to be a
descendant of what you have. In such these cases, you do not
make a new merge commit but instead just update to his
revision. This will happen frequently on a tracking branch
of a remote repository.</p>

<p>fetch Fetching a branch means to get the branchs head
ref from a remote repository, to find out which objects are
missing from the local object database, and to get them,
too. See also git-fetch(1).</p>

<p>file system Linus Torvalds originally designed git to be
a user space file system, i.e. the infrastructure to hold
files and directories. That ensured the efficiency and speed
of git.</p>

<p>git archive Synonym for repository (for arch
people).</p>

<p>grafts Grafts enables two otherwise different lines of
development to be joined together by recording fake ancestry
information for commits. This way you can make git pretend
the set of parents a commit has is different from what was
recorded when the commit was created. Configured via the
.git/info/grafts file.</p>

<p>hash In gits context, synonym to object name.</p>

<p>head A named reference to the commit at the tip of a
branch. Heads are stored in $GIT_DIR/refs/heads/, except
when using packed refs. (See git-pack-refs(1).)</p>

<p>HEAD The current branch. In more detail: Your working
tree is normally derived from the state of the tree referred
to by HEAD. HEAD is a reference to one of the heads in your
repository, except when using a detached HEAD, in which case
it may reference an arbitrary commit.</p>

<p>head ref A synonym for head.</p>

<p>hook During the normal execution of several git
commands, call-outs are made to optional scripts that allow
a developer to add functionality or checking. Typically, the
hooks allow for a command to be pre-verified and potentially
aborted, and allow for a post-notification after the
operation is done. The hook scripts are found in the
$GIT_DIR/hooks/ directory, and are enabled by simply
removing the .sample suffix from the filename. In earlier
versions of git you had to make them executable.</p>

<p>index A collection of files with stat information, whose
contents are stored as objects. The index is a stored
version of your working tree. Truth be told, it can also
contain a second, and even a third version of a working
tree, which are used when merging.</p>

<p>index entry The information regarding a particular file,
stored in the index. An index entry can be unmerged, if a
merge was started, but not yet finished (i.e. if the index
contains multiple versions of that file).</p>

<p>master The default development branch. Whenever you
create a git repository, a branch named &quot;master&quot;
is created, and becomes the active branch. In most cases,
this contains the local development, though that is purely
by convention and is not required.</p>

<p>merge As a verb: To bring the contents of another branch
(possibly from an external repository) into the current
branch. In the case where the merged-in branch is from a
different repository, this is done by first fetching the
remote branch and then merging the result into the current
branch. This combination of fetch and merge operations is
called a pull. Merging is performed by an automatic process
that identifies changes made since the branches diverged,
and then applies all those changes together. In cases where
changes conflict, manual intervention may be required to
complete the merge.</p>

<p>As a noun: unless it is a fast-forward, a successful
merge results in the creation of a new commit representing
the result of the merge, and having as parents the tips of
the merged branches. This commit is referred to as a
&quot;merge commit&quot;, or sometimes just a
&quot;merge&quot;.</p>

<p>object The unit of storage in git. It is uniquely
identified by the SHA1 of its contents. Consequently, an
object can not be changed.</p>

<p>object database Stores a set of &quot;objects&quot;, and
an individual object is identified by its object name. The
objects usually live in $GIT_DIR/objects/.</p>

<p>object identifier Synonym for object name.</p>

<p>object name The unique identifier of an object. The hash
of the objects contents using the Secure Hash Algorithm 1
and usually represented by the 40 character hexadecimal
encoding of the hash of the object.</p>

<p>object type One of the identifiers &quot;commit&quot;,
&quot;tree&quot;, &quot;tag&quot; or &quot;blob&quot;
describing the type of an object.</p>

<p>octopus To merge more than two branches. Also denotes an
intelligent predator.</p>

<p>origin The default upstream repository. Most projects
have at least one upstream project which they track. By
default origin is used for that purpose. New upstream
updates will be fetched into remote tracking branches named
origin/name-of-upstream-branch, which you can see using git
branch -r.</p>

<p>pack A set of objects which have been compressed into
one file (to save space or to transmit them
efficiently).</p>

<p>pack index The list of identifiers, and other
information, of the objects in a pack, to assist in
efficiently accessing the contents of a pack.</p>

<p>parent A commit object contains a (possibly empty) list
of the logical predecessor(s) in the line of development,
i.e. its parents.</p>

<p>pickaxe The term pickaxe refers to an option to the
diffcore routines that help select changes that add or
delete a given text string. With the --pickaxe-all option,
it can be used to view the full changeset that introduced or
removed, say, a particular line of text. See
git-diff(1).</p>

<p>plumbing Cute name for core git.</p>

<p>porcelain Cute name for programs and program suites
depending on core git, presenting a high level access to
core git. Porcelains expose more of a SCM interface than the
plumbing.</p>

<p>pull Pulling a branch means to fetch it and merge it.
See also git- pull(1).</p>

<p>push Pushing a branch means to get the branch s head ref
from a remote repository, find out if it is a direct
ancestor to the branchs local head ref, and in that case,
putting all objects, which are reachable from the local head
ref, and which are missing from the remote repository, into
the remote object database, and updating the remote head
ref. If the remote head is not an ancestor to the local
head, the push fails.</p>

<p>reachable All of the ancestors of a given commit are
said to be &quot;reachable&quot; from that commit. More
generally, one object is reachable from another if we can
reach the one from the other by a chain that follows tags to
whatever they tag, commits to their parents or trees, and
trees to the trees or blobs that they contain.</p>

<p>rebase To reapply a series of changes from a branch to a
different base, and reset the head of that branch to the
result.</p>

<p>ref A 40-byte hex representation of a SHA1 or a name
that denotes a particular object. These may be stored in
$GIT_DIR/refs/.</p>

<p>reflog A reflog shows the local &quot;history&quot; of a
ref. In other words, it can tell you what the 3rd last
revision in this repository was, and what was the current
state in this repository, yesterday 9:14pm. See
git-reflog(1) for details.</p>

<p>refspec A &quot;refspec&quot; is used by fetch and push
to describe the mapping between remote ref and local ref.
They are combined with a colon in the format
&lt;src&gt;:&lt;dst&gt;, preceded by an optional plus sign,
+. For example: git fetch $URL
refs/heads/master:refs/heads/origin means &quot;grab the
master branch head from the $URL and store it as my origin
branch head&quot;. And git push $URL
refs/heads/master:refs/heads/to-upstream means &quot;publish
my master branch head as to-upstream branch at $URL&quot;.
See also git-push(1).</p>

<p>repository A collection of refs together with an object
database containing all objects which are reachable from the
refs, possibly accompanied by meta data from one or more
porcelains. A repository can share an object database with
other repositories via alternates mechanism.</p>

<p>resolve The action of fixing up manually what a failed
automatic merge left behind.</p>

<p>revision A particular state of files and directories
which was stored in the object database. It is referenced by
a commit object.</p>

<p>rewind To throw away part of the development, i.e. to
assign the head to an earlier revision.</p>

<p>SCM Source code management (tool).</p>

<p>SHA1 Synonym for object name.</p>

<p>shallow repository A shallow repository has an
incomplete history some of whose commits have parents
cauterized away (in other words, git is told to pretend that
these commits do not have the parents, even though they are
recorded in the commit object). This is sometimes useful
when you are interested only in the recent history of a
project even though the real history recorded in the
upstream is much larger. A shallow repository is created by
giving the --depth option to git-clone(1), and its history
can be later deepened with git-fetch(1).</p>

<p>symref Symbolic reference: instead of containing the
SHA1 id itself, it is of the format ref: refs/some/thing and
when referenced, it recursively dereferences to this
reference. HEAD is a prime example of a symref. Symbolic
references are manipulated with the git-symbolic-ref(1)
command.</p>

<p>tag A ref pointing to a tag or commit object. In
contrast to a head, a tag is not changed by a commit. Tags
(not tag objects) are stored in $GIT_DIR/refs/tags/. A git
tag has nothing to do with a Lisp tag (which would be called
an object type in git s context). A tag is most typically
used to mark a particular point in the commit ancestry
chain.</p>

<p>tag object An object containing a ref pointing to
another object, which can contain a message just like a
commit object. It can also contain a (PGP) signature, in
which case it is called a &quot;signed tag object&quot;.</p>

<p>topic branch A regular git branch that is used by a
developer to identify a conceptual line of development.
Since branches are very easy and inexpensive, it is often
desirable to have several small branches that each contain
very well defined concepts or small incremental yet related
changes.</p>

<p>tracking branch A regular git branch that is used to
follow changes from another repository. A tracking branch
should not contain direct modifications or have local
commits made to it. A tracking branch can usually be
identified as the right-hand-side ref in a Pull:
refspec.</p>

<p>tree Either a working tree, or a tree object together
with the dependent blob and tree objects (i.e. a stored
representation of a working tree).</p>

<p>tree object An object containing a list of file names
and modes along with refs to the associated blob and/or tree
objects. A tree is equivalent to a directory.</p>

<p>tree-ish A ref pointing to either a commit object, a
tree object, or a tag object pointing to a tag or commit or
tree object.</p>

<p>unmerged index An index which contains unmerged index
entries.</p>

<p>unreachable object An object which is not reachable from
a branch, tag, or any other reference.</p>

<p>upstream branch The default branch that is merged into
the branch in question (or the branch in question is rebased
onto). It is configured via branch.&lt;name&gt;.remote and
branch.&lt;name&gt;.merge. If the upstream branch of A is
origin/B sometimes we say &quot;A is tracking
origin/B&quot;.</p>

<p>working tree The tree of actual checked out files. The
working tree normally contains the contents of the HEAD
commits tree, plus any local changes that you have made but
not yet committed.</p>
