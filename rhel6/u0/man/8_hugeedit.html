<p>NAME hugeedit - Set default policy for backing text and
data with hugepages</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS hugeedit binary hugeedit [options] binary</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION hugectl runs processes with a specific
policy for backing memory regions with hugepages. Ordinarily
when processes are relinked with libhugetlbfs using the
recommended linking method, either hugectl is required on
each execution or environment variables must be set for each
execution. hugeedit can be used to set bits in the ELF
header that determine if the text or data segments are
backed by default without further intervention.</p>

<p>If no arguments are specified, hugeedit will display
what the current defaults for each segment in a binary are.
The available options are</p>

<p>--text Back the text segments of the binary by
default.</p>

<p>--data Back the data segments of the binary by
default</p>

<p>--disable Back all segments using small pages by
default</p>

<p>AUTHORS libhugetlbfs was written by various people on
the libhugetlbfs-devel mailing list.</p>
