<p>NFS4_SETFACL(1) NFSv4 Access Control Lists
NFS4_SETFACL(1)</p>

<p>NAME nfs4_setfacl, nfs4_editfacl - manipulate NFSv4
file/directory access control lists</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS nfs4_setfacl [OPTIONS] COMMAND file...
nfs4_editfacl [OPTIONS] file...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION nfs4_setfacl manipulates the NFSv4 Access
Control List (ACL) of one or more files (or directories),
provided they are on a mounted NFSv4 filesystem which
supports ACLs.</p>

<p>nfs4_editfacl is equivalent to nfs4_setfacl -e.</p>

<p>Refer to the nfs4_acl(5) manpage for information about
NFSv4 ACL termi- nology and syntax.</p>

<p>COMMANDS -a acl_spec [index] add the ACEs from acl_spec
to files ACL. ACEs are inserted starting at the indexth
position (DEFAULT: 1) of files ACL.</p>

<p>-A acl_file [index] add the ACEs from the acl_spec in
acl_file to files ACL. ACEs are inserted starting at the
indexth position (DEFAULT: 1) of files ACL.</p>

<p>-x acl_spec | index delete ACEs matched from acl_spec -
or delete the indexth ACE - from files ACL. Note that the
ordering of the ACEs in acl_spec does not matter.</p>

<p>-X acl_file delete ACEs matched from the acl_spec in
acl_file from files ACL. Note that the ordering of the ACEs
in the acl_spec does not matter.</p>

<p>-s acl_spec set files ACL to acl_spec.</p>

<p>-S acl_file set files ACL to the acl_spec in
acl_file.</p>

<p>-e, --edit edit files ACL in the editor defined in the
EDITOR environment variable (DEFAULT: vi(1)) and set the
resulting ACL upon a clean exit, assuming changes made in
the editor were saved. Note that if multiple files are
specified, the editor will be serially invoked once per
file.</p>

<p>-m from_ace to_ace modify files ACL in-place by
replacing from_ace with to_ace.</p>

<p>-?, -h, --help display help text and exit.</p>

<p>--version display this programs version and exit.</p>

<p>NOTE: if - is given as the acl_file with the -A/-X/-S
flags, the acl_spec will be read from stdin.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -R, --recursive recursively apply to a directory
s files and subdirectories. Similar to setfacl(1), the
default behavior is to follow sym- links given on the
command line and to skip symlinks encountered while
recursing through directories.</p>

<p>-L, --logical in conjunction with -R/--recursive, a
logical walk follows all symbolic links.</p>

<p>-P, --physical in conjunction with -R/--recursive, a
physical walk skips all symbolic links.</p>

<p>--test display results of COMMAND, but do not save
changes.</p>

<p>PERMISSIONS ALIASES With nfs4_setfacl, one can use
simple abbreviations (&quot;aliases&quot;) to express
generic &quot;read&quot; (R), generic &quot;write&quot; (W),
and generic &quot;execute&quot; (X) permissions, familiar
from the POSIX mode bits used by, e.g., chmod(1). To use
these aliases, one can put them in the permissions field of
an NFSv4 ACE and nfs4_setfacl will convert them: an R is
expanded to rntcy, a W is expanded to watTNcCy (with D added
to direc- tory ACEs), and an X is expanded to xtcy. Please
refer to the nfs4_acl(5) manpage for information on specific
NFSv4 ACE permissions.</p>

<p>For example, if one wanted to grant generic
&quot;read&quot; and &quot;write&quot; access on a file, the
NFSv4 permissions field would normally contain something
like rwatTnNcCy. Instead, one might use aliases to
accomplish the same goal with RW.</p>

<p>The two permissions not included in any of the aliases
are d (delete) and o (write-owner). However, they can still
be used: e.g., a permis- sions field consisting of Wdo
expresses generic &quot;write&quot; access as well as the
ability to delete and change ownership.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Assume that the file foo has the following
NFSv4 ACL for the follow- ing examples:</p>

<p>A::OWNER@:rwatTnNcCy D::OWNER@:x A:g:GROUP@:rtncy
D:g:GROUP@:waxTC A::EVERYONE@:rtncy D::EVERYONE@:waxTC</p>

<p>- add ACE granting alice@nfsdomain.org generic
&quot;read&quot; and &quot;execute&quot; access (defaults to
prepending ACE to ACL): $ nfs4_setfacl -a
A::alice@nfsdomain.org:rxtncy foo</p>

<p>- add the same ACE as above, but using aliases: $
nfs4_setfacl -a A::alice@nfsdomain.org:RX foo</p>

<p>- edit existing ACL in a text editor and set modified
ACL on clean save/exit: $ nfs4_setfacl -e foo</p>

<p>- set ACL (overwrites original) to contents of a
spec_file named newacl.txt: $ nfs4_setfacl -S newacl.txt
foo</p>

<p>- recursively set the ACLs of all files and
subdirectories in the cur- rent directory, skipping all
symlinks encountered, to the ACL con- tained in the
spec_file named newacl.txt: $ nfs4_setfacl -R -P -S
newacl.txt *</p>

<p>- delete the first ACE, but only print the resulting ACL
(does not save changes): $ nfs4_setfacl --test -x 1 foo</p>

<p>- delete the last two ACEs above: $ nfs4_setfacl -x
&quot;A::EVERYONE@rtncy, D::EVERYONE@:waxTC&quot; foo</p>

<p>- modify (in-place) the second ACE above: $ nfs4_setfacl
-m D::OWNER@:x D::OWNER@:xo foo</p>

<p>- set ACLs of bar and frobaz to ACL of foo: $
nfs4_getfacl foo | nfs4_setfacl -S - bar frobaz</p>
