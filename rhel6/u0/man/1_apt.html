<p>NAME apt - annotation processing tool</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS apt [-classpath classpath] [-sourcepath
sourcepath] [-d directory] [-s directory] [-factorypath
path] [-factory class] [-print] [-nocompile] [-Akey[=val]
...] [javac option] sourcefiles [@files]</p>

<p>PARAMETERS Options may be in any order. For a discussion
of parameters which apply to a specific option, see OPTIONS
below.</p>

<p>sourcefiles Zero or more source files to be
processed.</p>

<p>@files One or more files that list source files or other
options</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The tool apt, annotation processing tool,
includes a set of new reflec- tive APIs and supporting
infrastructure to process program annotations. The apt
reflective APIs provide a build-time, source-based,
read-only view of program structure. These reflective APIs
are designed to cleanly model the Java(TM) programming
language s type system after the addition of generics.
First, apt runs annotation processors that can produce new
source code and other files. Next, apt can cause compila-
tion of both original and generated source files, easing
development. The reflective APIs and other APIs used to
interact with the tool are subpackages of
com.sun.mirror.</p>

<p>A fuller discussion of how the tool operates as well as
instructions for developing with apt are in Getting Started
with apt. @
http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/apt/Get-
tingStarted.html</p>

<p>Note: The functionality of apt has been subsumed by the
annotation-pro- cessing infrastructure that is now part of
the javac tool [ Solaris and Linux @
http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/tech-
notes/tools/solaris/javac.html] [Windows] and standardized
for use by all Java compilers. This new infrastructure
relies on the lan- guage model and annotation-processing
APIs that are now part of the Java Platform. It is
recommended that new annotation processor development be
based on the new APIs and the javac tool.</p>

<p>OPTIONS apt specific options -s dir Specify the
directory root under which processor-generated source files
will be placed; files are placed in subdirectories based on
package namespace.</p>

<p>-nocompile Do not compile source files to class
files.</p>

<p>-print Print out textual representation of specified
types; perform no annotation processing or compilation.</p>

<p>-A[key[=val]] Options to pass to annotation processors
-- these are not inter- preted by apt directly, but are made
available for use by individual processors</p>

<p>-factorypath path Specify where to find annotation
processor factories; if this option is used, the classpath
is not searched for factories.</p>

<p>-factory classname Name of annotation processor factory
to use; bypasses default dis- covery process</p>

<p>Options shared with javac -d dir Specify where to place
processor and javac generated class files</p>

<p>-cp path or -classpath path Specify where to find user
class files and annotation processor factories. If
-factorypath is given, the classpath is not searched for
factories.</p>

<p>Consult the javac(1) man page for information on javac
options.</p>

<p>NOTES The functionality of apt has been subsumed by the
standard annota- tion-processing infrastructure now offered
by javac. Support for apt and its associated APIs may be
discontinued in some future JDK release.</p>
