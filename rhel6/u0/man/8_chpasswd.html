<p>CHPASSWD(8) System Management Commands CHPASSWD(8)</p>

<p>NAME chpasswd - update passwords in batch mode</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS chpasswd [options]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The chpasswd command reads a list of user
name and password pairs from standard input and uses this
information to update a group of existing users. Each line
is of the format:</p>

<p>user_name:password</p>

<p>By default the supplied password must be in clear-text,
and is encrypted by chpasswd. Also the password age will be
updated, if present.</p>

<p>The default encryption algorithm can be defined for the
system with the ENCRYPT_METHOD variable of /etc/login.defs,
and can be overwiten with the -e, -m, or -c options.</p>

<p>chpasswd first update the password in memory, and then
commit all the changes to disk if no errors occured for any
users.</p>

<p>This command is intended to be used in a large system
environment where many accounts are created at a single
time.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The options which apply to the chpasswd command
are:</p>

<p>-c, --crypt-method Use the specified method to encrypt
the passwords.</p>

<p>The available methods are DES, MD5, NONE, and SHA256 or
SHA512 if your libc support these methods.</p>

<p>-e, --encrypted Supplied passwords are in encrypted
form.</p>

<p>-h, --help Display help message and exit.</p>

<p>-m, --md5 Use MD5 encryption instead of DES when the
supplied passwords are not encrypted.</p>

<p>-s, --sha-rounds Use the specified number of rounds to
encrypt the passwords.</p>

<p>The value 0 means that the system will choose the
default number of rounds for the crypt method (5000).</p>

<p>A minimal value of 1000 and a maximal value of
999,999,999 will be enforced.</p>

<p>You can only use this option with the SHA256 or SHA512
crypt method.</p>

<p>By default, the number of rounds is defined by the
SHA_CRYPT_MIN_ROUNDS and SHA_CRYPT_MAX_ROUNDS variables in
/etc/login.defs.</p>

<p>CAVEATS Remember to set permissions or umask to prevent
readability of unencrypted files by other users.</p>

<p>You should make sure the passwords and the encryption
method respect the system&acute;s password policy.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION The following configuration variables in
/etc/login.defs change the behavior of this tool:</p>

<p>ENCRYPT_METHOD (string) This defines the system default
encryption algorithm for encrypting passwords (if no
algorithm are specified on the command line).</p>

<p>It can take one of these values:</p>

<p>&middot; DES (default)</p>

<p>&middot; MD5</p>

<p>&middot; SHA256</p>

<p>&middot; SHA512</p>

<p>Note: this parameter overrides the MD5_CRYPT_ENAB
variable.</p>

<p>MD5_CRYPT_ENAB (boolean) Indicate if passwords must be
encrypted using the MD5-based algorithm. If set to yes, new
passwords will be encrypted using the MD5-based algorithm
compatible with the one used by recent releases of FreeBSD.
It supports passwords of unlimited length and longer salt
strings. Set to no if you need to copy encrypted passwords
to other systems which don&acute;t understand the new
algorithm. Default is no.</p>

<p>This variable is superceded by the ENCRYPT_METHOD
variable or by any command line option used to configure the
encryption algorithm.</p>

<p>This variable is deprecated. You should use
ENCRYPT_METHOD.</p>

<p>SHA_CRYPT_MIN_ROUNDS (number), SHA_CRYPT_MAX_ROUNDS
(number) When ENCRYPT_METHOD is set to SHA256 or SHA512,
this defines the number of SHA rounds used by the encryption
algorithm by default (when the number of rounds is not
specified on the command line).</p>

<p>With a lot of rounds, it is more difficult to brute
forcing the password. But note also that more CPU resources
will be needed to authenticate users.</p>

<p>If not specified, the libc will choose the default
number of rounds (5000).</p>

<p>The values must be inside the 1000-999999999 range.</p>

<p>If only one of the SHA_CRYPT_MIN_ROUNDS or
SHA_CRYPT_MAX_ROUNDS values is set, then this value will be
used.</p>

<p>If SHA_CRYPT_MIN_ROUNDS &gt; SHA_CRYPT_MAX_ROUNDS, the
highest value will be used.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/passwd User account information.</p>

<p>/etc/shadow Secure user account information.</p>

<p>/etc/login.defs Shadow password suite configuration.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO passwd(1), newusers(8), login.defs(5),
useradd(8).</p>
