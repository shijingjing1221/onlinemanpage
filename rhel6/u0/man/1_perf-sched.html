<p>NAME perf-sched - Tool to trace/measure scheduler
properties (latencies)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS perf sched {record|latency|replay|trace}</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Theres four variants of perf sched:</p>

<p>&acute;perf sched record &lt;command&gt;&acute; to
record the scheduling events of an arbitrary workload.</p>

<p>&acute;perf sched latency&acute; to report the per task
scheduling latencies and other scheduling properties of the
workload.</p>

<p>&acute;perf sched trace&acute; to see a detailed trace
of the workload that was recorded.</p>

<p>&acute;perf sched replay&acute; to simulate the workload
that was recorded via perf sched record. (this is done by
starting up mockup threads that mimic the workload based on
the events in the trace. These threads can then replay the
timings (CPU runtime and sleep patterns) of the workload as
it occured when it was recorded - and can repeat it a number
of times, measuring its performance.)</p>

<p>OPTIONS -D, --dump-raw-trace= Display verbose dump of
the sched data.</p>
