<p>EXPAND(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual EXPAND(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME expand - convert tabs to spaces</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS expand [-t tablist][file ...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The expand utility shall write files or the
standard input to the stan- dard output with &lt;tab&gt;s
replaced with one or more &lt;space&gt;s needed to pad to
the next tab stop. Any &lt;backspace&gt;s shall be copied to
the out- put and cause the column position count for tab
stop calculations to be decremented; the column position
count shall not be decremented below zero.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The expand utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>The following option shall be supported:</p>

<p>-t tablist Specify the tab stops. The application shall
ensure that the argument tablist consists of either a single
positive decimal integer or a list of tabstops. If a single
number is given, tabs shall be set that number of column
positions apart instead of the default 8.</p>

<p>If a list of tabstops is given, the application shall
ensure that it consists of a list of two or more positive
decimal integers, separated by &lt;blank&gt;s or commas, in
ascending order. The tabs shall be set at those specific
column positions. Each tab stop N shall be an integer value
greater than zero, and the list is in strictly ascending
order. This is taken to mean that, from the start of a line
of output, tabbing to position N shall cause the next
character output to be in the ( N+1)th column position on
that line.</p>

<p>In the event of expand having to process a &lt;tab&gt;
at a position beyond the last of those specified in a
multiple tab-stop list, the &lt;tab&gt; shall be replaced by
a single &lt;space&gt; in the output.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p>file The pathname of a text file to be used as
input.</p>

<p>STDIN See the INPUT FILES section.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES Input files shall be text files.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of expand:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments
and input files), the processing of &lt;tab&gt;s and
&lt;space&gt;s, and for the determination of the width in
column positions each character would occupy on an output
device.</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT The standard output shall be equivalent to the
input files with &lt;tab&gt;s converted into the appropriate
number of &lt;space&gt;s.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 Successful completion</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS The expand utility shall
terminate with an error message and non-zero exit status
upon encountering difficulties accessing one of the file
operands.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The expand utility is useful for preprocessing
text files (before sort- ing, looking at specific columns,
and so on) that contain &lt;tab&gt;s.</p>

<p>See the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,
Section 3.103, Column Position.</p>

<p>The tablist option-argument consists of integers in
ascending order. Utility Syntax Guideline 8 mandates that
expand shall accept the inte- gers (within the single
argument) separated using either commas or
&lt;blank&gt;s.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
