<p>NAME pbmtopgm - convert PBM image to PGM by averaging
areas</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pbmtopgm width height [pbmfile]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pbmtopgm reads a PBM image as input. It outputs a PGM
image in which each pixels gray level is the average of the
surrounding black and white input pixels. The surrounding
area is a rectangle of width by height pixels.</p>

<p>In other words, this is a convolution. pbmtopgm is
similar to a spe- cial case of pnmconvol.</p>

<p>You may need a pnmsmooth step after pbmtopgm.</p>

<p>pbmtopgm has the effect of anti-aliasing bitmaps which
contain distinct line features.</p>

<p>pbmtopgm works best with odd sample width and
heights.</p>

<p>You dont need pbmtopgm just to use a PGM program on a
PBM image. Any PGM program (assuming it uses the Netpbm
libraries to read the PGM input) takes PBM input as if it
were PGM, with only the mininum and maximum gray levels. So
unless your convolution rectangle is bigger than one pixel,
youre not gaining anything with a pbmtopgm step.</p>

<p>The opposite transformation (which would turn a PGM into
a PBM) is dithering. See pamditherbw.</p>
