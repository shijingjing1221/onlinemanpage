<p>NAME gendiff - utility to aid in error-free diff file
generation</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS gendiff &lt;directory&gt;
&lt;diff-extension&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION gendiff is a rather simple script which aids
in generating a diff file from a single directory. It takes
a directory name and a &quot;diff-exten- sion&quot; as its
only arguments. The diff extension should be a unique
sequence of characters added to the end of all original,
unmodified files. The output of the program is a diff file
which may be applied with the patch program to recreate the
changes.</p>

<p>The usual sequence of events for creating a diff is to
create two iden- tical directories, make changes in one
directory, and then use the diff utility to create a list of
differences between the two. Using gendiff eliminates the
need for the extra, original and unmodified directory copy.
Instead, only the individual files that are modified need to
be saved.</p>

<p>Before editing a file, copy the file, appending the
extension you have chosen to the filename. I.e. if you were
going to edit somefile.cpp and have chosen the extension
&quot;fix&quot;, copy it to somefile.cpp.fix before editing
it. Then edit the first copy (somefile.cpp).</p>

<p>After editing all the files you need to edit in this
fashion, enter the directory one level above where your
source code resides, and then type</p>

<p>$ gendiff somedirectory .fix &gt; mydiff-fix.patch</p>

<p>You should redirect the output to a file (as
illustrated) unless you want to see the results on
stdout.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO diff(1), patch(1)</p>
