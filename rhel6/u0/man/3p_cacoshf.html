<p>CACOSH(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual CACOSH(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME cacosh, cacoshf, cacoshl - complex arc hyperbolic
cosine functions</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;complex.h&gt;</p>

<p>double complex cacosh(double complex z); float complex
cacoshf(float complex z); long double complex cacoshl(long
double complex z);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION These functions shall compute the complex
arc hyperbolic cosine of z, with a branch cut at values less
than 1 along the real axis.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE These functions shall return the complex
arc hyperbolic cosine value, in the range of a half-strip of
non-negative values along the real axis and in the interval
[-ipi, +ipi] along the imaginary axis.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
