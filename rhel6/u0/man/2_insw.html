<p>OUTB(2) Linux Programmer s Manual OUTB(2)</p>

<p>NAME outb, outw, outl, outsb, outsw, outsl, inb, inw,
inl, insb, insw, insl, outb_p, outw_p, outl_p, inb_p, inw_p,
inl_p - port I/O</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This family of functions is used to do
low-level port input and output. The out* functions do port
output, the in* functions do port input; the b-suffix
functions are byte-width and the w-suffix functions word-
width; the _p-suffix functions pause until the I/O
completes.</p>

<p>They are primarily designed for internal kernel use, but
can be used from user space.</p>

<p>You compile with -O or -O2 or similar. The functions are
defined as inline macros, and will not be substituted in
without optimization enabled, causing unresolved references
at link time.</p>

<p>You use ioperm(2) or alternatively iopl(2) to tell the
kernel to allow the user space application to access the I/O
ports in question. Fail- ure to do this will cause the
application to receive a segmentation fault.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO outb() and friends are hardware-specific.
The value argument is passed first and the port argument is
passed second, which is the opposite order from most DOS
implementations.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO ioperm(2), iopl(2)</p>

<p>COLOPHON This page is part of release 3.22 of the Linux
man-pages project. A description of the project, and
information about reporting bugs, can be found at
