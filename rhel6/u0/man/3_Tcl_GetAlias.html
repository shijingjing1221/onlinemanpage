<p>DESCRIPTION These procedures are intended for access to
the multiple interpreter facility from inside C programs.
They enable managing multiple inter- preters in a
hierarchical relationship, and the management of aliases,
commands that when invoked in one interpreter execute a
command in another interpreter. The return value for those
procedures that return an int is either TCL_OK or TCL_ERROR.
If TCL_ERROR is returned then the result field of the
interpreter contains an error message.</p>

<p>Tcl_CreateSlave creates a new interpreter as a slave of
interp. It also creates a slave command named slaveName in
interp which allows interp to manipulate the new slave. If
isSafe is zero, the command creates a trusted slave in which
Tcl code has access to all the Tcl commands. If it is 1, the
command creates a safe slave in which Tcl code has access
only to set of Tcl commands defined as Safe Tcl; see the
manual entry for the Tcl interp command for details. If the
cre- ation of the new slave interpreter failed, NULL is
returned.</p>

<p>Tcl_IsSafe returns 1 if interp is safe (was created with
the TCL_SAFE_INTERPRETER flag specified), 0 otherwise.</p>

<p>Tcl_MakeSafe marks interp as safe, so that future calls
to Tcl_IsSafe will return 1. It also removes all known
potentially-unsafe core func- tionality (both commands and
variables) from interp. However, it can- not know what parts
of an extension or application are safe and does not make
any attempt to remove those parts, so safety is not
guaranteed after calling Tcl_MakeSafe. Callers will want to
take care with their use of Tcl_MakeSafe to avoid false
claims of safety. For many situa- tions, Tcl_CreateSlave may
be a better choice, since it creates inter- preters in a
known-safe state.</p>

<p>Tcl_GetSlave returns a pointer to a slave interpreter of
interp. The slave interpreter is identified by slaveName. If
no such slave inter- preter exists, NULL is returned.</p>

<p>Tcl_GetMaster returns a pointer to the master
interpreter of interp. If interp has no master (it is a
top-level interpreter) then NULL is returned.</p>

<p>Tcl_GetInterpPath sets the result field in askingInterp
to the relative path between askingInterp and slaveInterp;
slaveInterp must be a slave of askingInterp. If the
computation of the relative path succeeds, TCL_OK is
returned, else TCL_ERROR is returned and the result field in
askingInterp contains the error message.</p>

<p>Tcl_CreateAlias creates an object command named slaveCmd
in slaveInterp that when invoked, will cause the command
targetCmd to be invoked in targetInterp. The arguments
specified by the strings contained in argv are always
prepended to any arguments supplied in the invocation of
slaveCmd and passed to targetCmd. This operation returns
TCL_OK if it succeeds, or TCL_ERROR if it fails; in that
case, an error message is left in the object result of
slaveInterp. Note that there are no restrictions on the
ancestry relationship (as created by Tcl_Cre- ateSlave)
between slaveInterp and targetInterp. Any two interpreters
can be used, without any restrictions on how they are
related.</p>

<p>Tcl_CreateAliasObj is similar to Tcl_CreateAlias except
that it takes a vector of objects to pass as additional
arguments instead of a vector of strings.</p>

<p>Tcl_GetAlias returns information about an alias
aliasName in interp. Any of the result fields can be NULL,
in which case the corresponding datum is not returned. If a
result field is non-NULL, the address indi- cated is set to
the corresponding datum. For example, if targetNamePtr is
non-NULL it is set to a pointer to the string containing the
name of the target command.</p>

<p>Tcl_GetAliasObj is similar to Tcl_GetAlias except that
it returns a pointer to a vector of Tcl_Obj structures
instead of a vector of strings.</p>

<p>Tcl_ExposeCommand moves the command named hiddenCmdName
from the set of hidden commands to the set of exposed
commands, putting it under the name cmdName. HiddenCmdName
must be the name of an existing hidden command, or the
operation will return TCL_ERROR and leave an error mes- sage
in the result field in interp. If an exposed command named
cmd- Name already exists, the operation returns TCL_ERROR
and leaves an error message in the object result of interp.
If the operation suc- ceeds, it returns TCL_OK. After
executing this command, attempts to use cmdName in a call to
Tcl_Eval or with the Tcl eval command will again
succeed.</p>

<p>Tcl_HideCommand moves the command named cmdName from the
set of exposed commands to the set of hidden commands, under
the name hiddenCmdName. CmdName must be the name of an
existing exposed command, or the opera- tion will return
TCL_ERROR and leave an error message in the object result of
interp. Currently both cmdName and hiddenCmdName must not
contain namespace qualifiers, or the operation will return
TCL_ERROR and leave an error message in the object result of
interp. The CmdName will be looked up in the global
namespace, and not relative to the cur- rent namespace, even
if the current namespace is not the global one. If a hidden
command whose name is hiddenCmdName already exists, the
operation also returns TCL_ERROR and the result field in
interp con- tains an error message. If the operation
succeeds, it returns TCL_OK. After executing this command,
attempts to use cmdName in a call to Tcl_Eval or with the
Tcl eval command will fail.</p>
