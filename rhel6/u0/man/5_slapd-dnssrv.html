<p>NAME slapd-dnssrv - DNS SRV referral backend to
slapd</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS /etc/openldap/slapd.conf</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The DNSSRV backend to slapd(8) serves up
referrals based upon SRV resource records held in the Domain
Name System.</p>

<p>This backend is experimental.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION The DNSSRV backend has no backend nor
database specific options. It is configured simply by
&quot;database dnssrv&quot; followed a suffix directive,
e.g. suffix &quot;&quot;.</p>

<p>ACCESS CONTROL The dnssrv backend does not honor all ACL
semantics as described in slapd.access(5). In fact, this
backend only implements the search operation when the
manageDSAit control (RFC 3296) is used, otherwise for every
operation a referral, whenever appropriate, or an error is
returned. Currently, there is no means to condition the
returning of the referral by means of ACLs; no access
control is implemented, except for read (=r) access to the
returned entries, which is actually pro- vided by the
frontend. Note, however, that the information returned by
this backend is collected through the DNS, so it is public
by defini- tion.</p>
