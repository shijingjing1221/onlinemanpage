<p>NAME javah - C Header and Stub File Generator</p>

<p>javah produces C header files and C source files from a
Java class. These files provide the connective glue that
allow your Java and C code to interact.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS javah [ options ] fully-qualified-classname. .
. javah_g [ options ] fully-qualified-classname. . .</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION javah generates C header and source files
that are needed to implement native methods. The generated
header and source files are used by C programs to reference
an objects instance variables from native source code. The
.h file contains a struct definition whose layout parallels
the layout of the corresponding class. The fields in the
struct corre- spond to instance variables in the class.</p>

<p>The name of the header file and the structure declared
within it are derived from the name of the class. If the
class passed to javah is inside a package, the package name
is prepended to both the header file name and the structure
name. Underscores (_) are used as name delim- iters.</p>

<p>By default javah creates a header file for each class
listed on the command line and puts the files in the current
directory. Use the -stubs option to create source files. Use
the -o option to concatenate the results for all listed
classes into a single file.</p>

<p>The new native method interface, Java Native Interface
(JNI), does not require header information or stub files.
javah can still be used to generate native method function
proptotypes needed for JNI-style native methods. javah
produces JNI-style output by default, and places the result
in the .h file.</p>

<p>javah_g is a non-optimized version of javah suitable for
use with debuggers like jdb.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -o outputfile Concatenates the resulting header
or source files for all the classes listed on the command
line into outputfile. Only one of -o or -d may be used.</p>

<p>-d directory Sets the directory where javah saves the
header files or the stub files. Only one of -d or -o may be
used.</p>

<p>-stubs Causes javah to generate C declarations from the
Java object file.</p>

<p>-verbose Indicates verbose output and causes javah to
print a message to std- out concerning the status of the
generated files.</p>

<p>-help Print help message for javah usage.</p>

<p>-version Print out javah version information.</p>

<p>-jni Causes javah to create an output file containing
JNI-style native method function prototypes. This is the
default output, so use of -jni is optional.</p>

<p>-classpath path Specifies the path javah uses to look up
classes. Overrides the default or the CLASSPATH environment
variable if it is set. Directo- ries are separated by
colons. Thus the general format for path is:</p>

<p>.:&lt;your_path&gt;</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>.:/home/avh/classes:/usr/local/java/classes</p>

<p>As a special convenience, a class path element
containing a basename of * is considered equivalent to
specifying a list of all the files in the directory with the
extension .jar or .JAR (a java program cannot tell the
difference between the two invocations). For example, if
directory foo contains a.jar and b.JAR, then the class path
element foo/* is expanded to a A.jar:b.JAR, except that the
order of jar files is unspecified. All jar files in the
specified directory, even hidden ones, are included in the
list. A classpath entry consist- ing simply of * expands to
a list of all the jar files in the current directory. The
CLASSPATH environment variable, where defined, will be
similarly expanded. Any classpath wildcard expansion occurs
before the Java virtual machine is started -- no Java
program will ever see unex- panded wildcards except by
querying the environment. For example; by invoking
System.getenv(&quot;CLASSPATH&quot;).</p>

<p>-bootclasspath path Specifies path from which to load
bootstrap classes. By default, the bootstrap classes are the
classes implementing the core Java 2 plat- form located in
jre/lib/rt.jar and several other jar files.</p>

<p>-old Specifies that old JDK1.0-style header files should
be generated.</p>

<p>-force Specifies that output files should always be
written.</p>

<p>-Joption Pass option to the Java virtual machine, where
option is one of the options described on the reference page
for the java application launcher. For example, -J-Xms48m
sets the startup memory to 48 megabytes.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES CLASSPATH Used to provide the
system a path to user-defined classes. Directo- ries are
separated by colons, for example,</p>
