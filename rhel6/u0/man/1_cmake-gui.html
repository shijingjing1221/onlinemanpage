<p>NAME cmake-gui - CMake GUI.</p>

<p>USAGE cmake-gui [options] cmake-gui [options]
&lt;path-to-source&gt; cmake-gui [options]
&lt;path-to-existing-build&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The &quot;cmake-gui&quot; executable is the
CMake GUI. Project configuration settings may be specified
interactively. Brief instructions are pro- vided at the
bottom of the window when the program is running.</p>

<p>CMake is a cross-platform build system generator.
Projects specify their build process with
platform-independent CMake listfiles included in each
directory of a source tree with the name CMakeLists.txt.
Users build a project by using CMake to generate a build
system for a native tool on their platform.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --copyright [file] Print the CMake copyright and
exit.</p>

<p>If a file is specified, the copyright is written into
it.</p>

<p>--help Print usage information and exit.</p>

<p>Usage describes the basic command line interface and its
options.</p>

<p>--help-full [file] Print full help and exit.</p>

<p>Full help displays most of the documentation provided by
the UNIX man page. It is provided for use on non-UNIX
platforms, but is also convenient if the man page is not
installed. If a file is specified, the help is written into
it.</p>

<p>--help-html [file] Print full help in HTML format.</p>

<p>This option is used by CMake authors to help produce web
pages. If a file is specified, the help is written into
it.</p>

<p>--help-man [file] Print full help as a UNIX man page and
exit.</p>

<p>This option is used by the cmake build to generate the
UNIX man page. If a file is specified, the help is written
into it.</p>

<p>--version [file] Show program name/version banner and
exit.</p>

<p>If a file is specified, the version is written into
it.</p>

<p>GENERATORS The following generators are available on
this platform:</p>

<p>Unix Makefiles Generates standard UNIX makefiles.</p>

<p>A hierarchy of UNIX makefiles is generated into the
build tree. Any standard UNIX-style make program can build
the project through the default make target. A &quot;make
install&quot; target is also provided.</p>

<p>CodeBlocks - Unix Makefiles Generates CodeBlocks project
files.</p>

<p>Project files for CodeBlocks will be created in the top
direc- tory and in every subdirectory which features a
CMakeLists.txt file containing a PROJECT() call.
Additionally a hierarchy of makefiles is generated into the
build tree. The appropriate make program can build the
project through the default make tar- get. A &quot;make
install&quot; target is also provided.</p>

<p>Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles Generates Eclipse CDT 4.0
project files.</p>

<p>Project files for Eclipse will be created in the top
directory and will have a linked resource to every
subdirectory which fea- tures a CMakeLists.txt file
containing a PROJECT() call.Addi- tionally a hierarchy of
makefiles is generated into the build tree. The appropriate
make program can build the project through the default make
target. A &quot;make install&quot; target is also pro-
vided.</p>

<p>KDevelop3 Generates KDevelop 3 project files.</p>

<p>Project files for KDevelop 3 will be created in the top
direc- tory and in every subdirectory which features a
CMakeLists.txt file containing a PROJECT() call. If you
change the settings using KDevelop cmake will try its best
to keep your changes when regenerating the project files.
Additionally a hierarchy of UNIX makefiles is generated into
the build tree. Any standard UNIX-style make program can
build the project through the default make target. A
&quot;make install&quot; target is also provided.</p>

<p>KDevelop3 - Unix Makefiles Generates KDevelop 3 project
files.</p>

<p>Project files for KDevelop 3 will be created in the top
direc- tory and in every subdirectory which features a
CMakeLists.txt file containing a PROJECT() call. If you
change the settings using KDevelop cmake will try its best
to keep your changes when regenerating the project files.
Additionally a hierarchy of UNIX makefiles is generated into
the build tree. Any standard UNIX-style make program can
build the project through the default make target. A
&quot;make install&quot; target is also provided.</p>

<p>COMMANDS add_custom_command Add a custom build rule to
the generated build system.</p>

<p>There are two main signatures for add_custom_command The
first signature is for adding a custom command to produce an
output.</p>

<p>add_custom_command(OUTPUT output1 [output2 ...] COMMAND
command1 [ARGS] [args1...] [COMMAND command2 [ARGS]
[args2...] ...] [MAIN_DEPENDENCY depend] [DEPENDS
[depends...]] [IMPLICIT_DEPENDS &lt;lang1&gt; depend1 ...]
[WORKING_DIRECTORY dir] [COMMENT comment] [VERBATIM]
[APPEND])</p>

<p>This defines a command to generate specified OUTPUT
file(s). A target created in the same directory
(CMakeLists.txt file) that specifies any output of the
custom command as a source file is given a rule to generate
the file using the command at build time. If an output name
is a relative path it will be inter- preted relative to the
build tree directory corresponding to the current source
directory. Note that MAIN_DEPENDENCY is com- pletely
optional and is used as a suggestion to visual studio about
where to hang the custom command. In makefile terms this
creates a new target in the following form:</p>

<p>OUTPUT: MAIN_DEPENDENCY DEPENDS COMMAND</p>

<p>If more than one command is specified they will be
executed in order. The optional ARGS argument is for
backward compatibility and will be ignored.</p>

<p>The second signature adds a custom command to a target
such as a library or executable. This is useful for
performing an opera- tion before or after building the
target. The command becomes part of the target and will only
execute when the target itself is built. If the target is
already built, the command will not execute.</p>

<p>add_custom_command(TARGET target PRE_BUILD | PRE_LINK |
POST_BUILD COMMAND command1 [ARGS] [args1...] [COMMAND
command2 [ARGS] [args2...] ...] [WORKING_DIRECTORY dir]
[COMMENT comment] [VERBATIM])</p>

<p>This defines a new command that will be associated with
building the specified target. When the command will happen
is determined by which of the following is specified:</p>

<p>PRE_BUILD - run before all other dependencies PRE_LINK -
run after other dependencies POST_BUILD - run after the
target has been built</p>

<p>Note that the PRE_BUILD option is only supported on
Visual Stu- dio 7 or later. For all other generators
PRE_BUILD will be treated as PRE_LINK.</p>

<p>If WORKING_DIRECTORY is specified the command will be
executed in the directory given. If COMMENT is set, the
value will be displayed as a message before the commands are
executed at build time. If APPEND is specified the COMMAND
and DEPENDS option val- ues are appended to the custom
command for the first output specified. There must have
already been a previous call to this command with the same
output. The COMMENT, WORKING_DIRECTORY, and MAIN_DEPENDENCY
options are currently ignored when APPEND is given, but may
be used in the future.</p>

<p>If VERBATIM is given then all arguments to the commands
will be escaped properly for the build tool so that the
invoked command receives each argument unchanged. Note that
one level of escapes is still used by the CMake language
processor before add_custom_command even sees the arguments.
Use of VERBATIM is recommended as it enables correct
behavior. When VERBATIM is not given the behavior is
platform specific because there is no pro- tection of
tool-specific special characters.</p>

<p>If the output of the custom command is not actually
created as a file on disk it should be marked as SYMBOLIC
with SET_SOURCE_FILES_PROPERTIES.</p>

<p>The IMPLICIT_DEPENDS option requests scanning of
implicit depen- dencies of an input file. The language given
specifies the pro- gramming language whose corresponding
dependency scanner should be used. Currently only C and CXX
language scanners are sup- ported. Dependencies discovered
from the scanning are added to those of the custom command
at build time. Note that the IMPLICIT_DEPENDS option is
currently supported only for Makefile generators and will be
ignored by other generators.</p>

<p>If COMMAND specifies an executable target (created by
ADD_EXE- CUTABLE) it will automatically be replaced by the
location of the executable created at build time.
Additionally a tar- get-level dependency will be added so
that the executable target will be built before any target
using this custom command. How- ever this does NOT add a
file-level dependency that would cause the custom command to
re-run whenever the executable is recom- piled.</p>

<p>The DEPENDS option specifies files on which the command
depends. If any dependency is an OUTPUT of another custom
command in the same directory (CMakeLists.txt file) CMake
automatically brings the other custom command into the
target in which this command is built. If DEPENDS specifies
any target (created by an ADD_* command) a target-level
dependency is created to make sure the target is built
before any target using this custom command. Additionally,
if the target is an executable or library a file-level
dependency is created to cause the custom command to re-run
whenever the target is recompiled.</p>

<p>add_custom_target Add a target with no output so it will
always be built.</p>

<p>add_custom_target(Name [ALL] [command1 [args1...]]
[COMMAND command2 [args2...] ...] [DEPENDS depend depend
depend ... ] [WORKING_DIRECTORY dir] [COMMENT comment]
[VERBATIM] [SOURCES src1 [src2...]])</p>

<p>Adds a target with the given name that executes the
given com- mands. The target has no output file and is
ALWAYS CONSIDERED OUT OF DATE even if the commands try to
create a file with the name of the target. Use
ADD_CUSTOM_COMMAND to generate a file with dependencies. By
default nothing depends on the custom tar- get. Use
ADD_DEPENDENCIES to add dependencies to or from other
targets. If the ALL option is specified it indicates that
this target should be added to the default build target so
that it will be run every time (the command cannot be called
ALL). The command and arguments are optional and if not
specified an empty target will be created. If
WORKING_DIRECTORY is set, then the command will be run in
that directory. If COMMENT is set, the value will be
displayed as a message before the commands are executed at
build time. Dependencies listed with the DEPENDS argument
may reference files and outputs of custom commands cre- ated
with add_custom_command() in the same directory (CMake-
Lists.txt file).</p>

<p>If VERBATIM is given then all arguments to the commands
will be escaped properly for the build tool so that the
invoked command receives each argument unchanged. Note that
one level of escapes is still used by the CMake language
processor before add_custom_target even sees the arguments.
Use of VERBATIM is recommended as it enables correct
behavior. When VERBATIM is not given the behavior is
platform specific because there is no pro- tection of
tool-specific special characters.</p>

<p>The SOURCES option specifies additional source files to
be included in the custom target. Specified source files
will be added to IDE project files for convenience in
editing even if they have not build rules.</p>

<p>add_definitions Adds -D define flags to the compilation
of source files.</p>

<p>add_definitions(-DFOO -DBAR ...)</p>

<p>Adds flags to the compiler command line for sources in
the cur- rent directory and below. This command can be used
to add any flags, but it was originally intended to add
preprocessor defi- nitions. Flags beginning in -D or /D that
look like preproces- sor definitions are automatically added
to the COMPILE_DEFINI- TIONS property for the current
directory. Definitions with non-trival values may be left in
the set of flags instead of being converted for reasons of
backwards compatibility. See documentation of the directory,
target, and source file COM- PILE_DEFINITIONS properties for
details on adding preprocessor definitions to specific
scopes and configurations.</p>

<p>add_dependencies Add a dependency between top-level
targets.</p>

<p>add_dependencies(target-name depend-target1
depend-target2 ...)</p>

<p>Make a top-level target depend on other top-level
targets. A top-level target is one created by
ADD_EXECUTABLE, ADD_LIBRARY, or ADD_CUSTOM_TARGET. Adding
dependencies with this command can be used to make sure one
target is built before another target. See the DEPENDS
option of ADD_CUSTOM_TARGET and ADD_CUSTOM_COM- MAND for
adding file-level dependencies in custom rules. See the
OBJECT_DEPENDS option in SET_SOURCE_FILES_PROPERTIES to add
file-level dependencies to object files.</p>

<p>add_executable Add an executable to the project using
the specified source files.</p>

<p>add_executable(&lt;name&gt; [WIN32] [MACOSX_BUNDLE]
[EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL] source1 source2 ... sourceN)</p>

<p>Adds an executable target called &lt;name&gt; to be
built from the source files listed in the command
invocation. The &lt;name&gt; cor- responds to the logical
target name and must be globally unique within a project.
The actual file name of the executable built is constructed
based on conventions of the native platform (such as
&lt;name&gt;.exe or just &lt;name&gt;).</p>

<p>By default the executable file will be created in the
build tree directory corresponding to the source tree
directory in which the command was invoked. See
documentation of the RUNTIME_OUT- PUT_DIRECTORY target
property to change this location. See doc- umentation of the
OUTPUT_NAME target property to change the &lt;name&gt; part
of the final file name.</p>

<p>If WIN32 is given the property WIN32_EXECUTABLE will be
set on the target created. See documentation of that target
property for details.</p>

<p>If MACOSX_BUNDLE is given the corresponding property
will be set on the created target. See documentation of the
MACOSX_BUNDLE target property for details.</p>

<p>If EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL is given the corresponding property
will be set on the created target. See documentation of the
EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL target property for details.</p>

<p>The add_executable command can also create IMPORTED
executable targets using this signature:</p>

<p>add_executable(&lt;name&gt; IMPORTED)</p>

<p>An IMPORTED executable target references an executable
file located outside the project. No rules are generated to
build it. The target name has scope in the directory in
which it is created and below. It may be referenced like any
target built within the project. IMPORTED executables are
useful for conve- nient reference from commands like
add_custom_command. Details about the imported executable
are specified by setting proper- ties whose names begin in
&quot;IMPORTED_&quot;. The most important such property is
IMPORTED_LOCATION (and its per-configuration version
IMPORTED_LOCATION_&lt;CONFIG&gt;) which specifies the
location of the main executable file on disk. See
documentation of the IMPORTED_* properties for more
information.</p>

<p>add_library Add a library to the project using the
specified source files.</p>

<p>add_library(&lt;name&gt; [STATIC | SHARED | MODULE]
[EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL] source1 source2 ... sourceN)</p>

<p>Adds a library target called &lt;name&gt; to be built
from the source files listed in the command invocation. The
&lt;name&gt; corresponds to the logical target name and must
be globally unique within a project. The actual file name of
the library built is con- structed based on conventions of
the native platform (such as lib&lt;name&gt;.a or
&lt;name&gt;.lib).</p>

<p>STATIC, SHARED, or MODULE may be given to specify the
type of library to be created. STATIC libraries are archives
of object files for use when linking other targets. SHARED
libraries are linked dynamically and loaded at runtime.
MODULE libraries are plugins that are not linked into other
targets but may be loaded dynamically at runtime using
dlopen-like functionality. If no type is given explicitly
the type is STATIC or SHARED based on whether the current
value of the variable BUILD_SHARED_LIBS is true.</p>

<p>By default the library file will be created in the build
tree directory corresponding to the source tree directory in
which the command was invoked. See documentation of the
ARCHIVE_OUT- PUT_DIRECTORY, LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY, and
RUNTIME_OUT- PUT_DIRECTORY target properties to change this
location. See documentation of the OUTPUT_NAME target
property to change the &lt;name&gt; part of the final file
name.</p>

<p>If EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL is given the corresponding property
will be set on the created target. See documentation of the
EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL target property for details.</p>

<p>The add_library command can also create IMPORTED library
targets using this signature:</p>

<p>add_library(&lt;name&gt;
&lt;SHARED|STATIC|MODULE|UNKNOWN&gt; IMPORTED)</p>

<p>An IMPORTED library target references a library file
located outside the project. No rules are generated to build
it. The target name has scope in the directory in which it
is created and below. It may be referenced like any target
built within the project. IMPORTED libraries are useful for
convenient ref- erence from commands like
target_link_libraries. Details about the imported library
are specified by setting properties whose names begin in
&quot;IMPORTED_&quot;. The most important such property is
IMPORTED_LOCATION (and its per-configuration version
IMPORTED_LOCATION_&lt;CONFIG&gt;) which specifies the
location of the main library file on disk. See documentation
of the IMPORTED_* properties for more information.</p>

<p>add_subdirectory Add a subdirectory to the build.</p>

<p>add_subdirectory(source_dir [binary_dir]
[EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL])</p>

<p>Add a subdirectory to the build. The source_dir
specifies the directory in which the source CmakeLists.txt
and code files are located. If it is a relative path it will
be evaluated with respect to the current directory (the
typical usage), but it may also be an absolute path. The
binary_dir specifies the directory in which to place the
output files. If it is a relative path it will be evaluated
with respect to the current output directory, but it may
also be an absolute path. If binary_dir is not speci- fied,
the value of source_dir, before expanding any relative path,
will be used (the typical usage). The CMakeLists.txt file in
the specified source directory will be processed immediately
by CMake before processing in the current input file
continues beyond this command.</p>

<p>If the EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL argument is provided then
targets in the subdirectory will not be included in the ALL
target of the par- ent directory by default, and will be
excluded from IDE project files. Users must explicitly build
targets in the subdirectory. This is meant for use when the
subdirectory contains a separate part of the project that is
useful but not necessary, such as a set of examples.
Typically the subdirectory should contain its own project()
command invocation so that a full build system will be
generated in the subdirectory (such as a VS IDE solution
file). Note that inter-target dependencies supercede this
exclusion. If a target built by the parent project depends
on a target in the subdirectory, the dependee target will be
included in the parent project build system to satisfy the
dependency.</p>

<p>add_test Add a test to the project with the specified
arguments.</p>

<p>add_test(testname Exename arg1 arg2 ...)</p>

<p>If the ENABLE_TESTING command has been run, this command
adds a test target to the current directory. If
ENABLE_TESTING has not been run, this command does nothing.
The tests are run by the testing subsystem by executing
Exename with the specified argu- ments. Exename can be
either an executable built by this project or an arbitrary
executable on the system (like tclsh). The test will be run
with the current working directory set to the CMakeList.txt
files corresponding directory in the binary tree.</p>

<p>aux_source_directory Find all source files in a
directory.</p>

<p>aux_source_directory(&lt;dir&gt; &lt;variable&gt;)</p>

<p>Collects the names of all the source files in the
specified directory and stores the list in the
&lt;variable&gt; provided. This command is intended to be
used by projects that use explicit template instantiation.
Template instantiation files can be stored in a
&quot;Templates&quot; subdirectory and collected
automatically using this command to avoid manually listing
all instantiations.</p>

<p>It is tempting to use this command to avoid writing the
list of source files for a library or executable target.
While this seems to work, there is no way for CMake to
generate a build system that knows when a new source file
has been added. Nor- mally the generated build system knows
when it needs to rerun CMake because the CMakeLists.txt file
is modified to add a new source. When the source is just
added to the directory without modifying this file, one
would have to manually rerun CMake to generate a build
system incorporating the new file.</p>

<p>break Break from an enclosing foreach or while loop.</p>

<p>break()</p>

<p>Breaks from an enclosing foreach loop or while loop</p>

<p>build_command Get the command line that will build this
project.</p>

<p>build_command(&lt;variable&gt; &lt;makecommand&gt;)</p>

<p>Sets the given &lt;variable&gt; to a string containing
the command that will build this project from the root of
the build tree using the build tool given by
&lt;makecommand&gt;. &lt;makecommand&gt; should be msdev,
nmake, make or one of the end user build tools. This is
useful for configuring testing systems.</p>

<p>cmake_minimum_required Set the minimum required version
of cmake for a project.</p>

<p>cmake_minimum_required(VERSION major[.minor[.patch]]
[FATAL_ERROR])</p>

<p>If the current version of CMake is lower than that
required it will stop processing the project and report an
error. When a version higher than 2.4 is specified the
command implicitly invokes</p>

<p>cmake_policy(VERSION major[.minor[.patch]])</p>

<p>which sets the cmake policy version level to the version
speci- fied. When version 2.4 or lower is given the command
implicitly invokes</p>

<p>cmake_policy(VERSION 2.4)</p>

<p>which enables compatibility features for CMake 2.4 and
lower.</p>

<p>The FATAL_ERROR option is accepted but ignored by CMake
2.6 and higher. It should be specified so CMake versions 2.4
and lower fail with an error instead of just a warning.</p>

<p>cmake_policy Manage CMake Policy settings.</p>

<p>As CMake evolves it is sometimes necessary to change
existing behavior in order to fix bugs or improve
implementations of existing features. The CMake Policy
mechanism is designed to help keep existing projects
building as new versions of CMake introduce changes in
behavior. Each new policy (behavioral change) is given an
identifier of the form &quot;CMP&lt;NNNN&gt;&quot; where
&quot;&lt;NNNN&gt;&quot; is an integer index. Documentation
associated with each policy describes the OLD and NEW
behavior and the reason the policy was introduced. Projects
may set each policy to select the desired behavior. When
CMake needs to know which behavior to use it checks for a
setting specified by the project. If no setting is available
the OLD behavior is assumed and a warning is produced
requesting that the policy be set.</p>

<p>The cmake_policy command is used to set policies to OLD
or NEW behavior. While setting policies individually is
supported, we encourage projects to set policies based on
CMake versions.</p>

<p>cmake_policy(VERSION major.minor[.patch])</p>

<p>Specify that the current CMake list file is written for
the given version of CMake. All policies introduced in the
speci- fied version or earlier will be set to use NEW
behavior. All policies introduced after the specified
version will be reset to use OLD behavior with a warning.
This effectively requests behavior preferred as of a given
CMake version and tells newer CMake versions to warn about
their new policies. The policy version specified must be at
least 2.4 or the command will report an error. In order to
get compatibility features sup- porting versions earlier
than 2.4 see documentation of policy CMP0001.</p>

<p>cmake_policy(SET CMP&lt;NNNN&gt; NEW) cmake_policy(SET
CMP&lt;NNNN&gt; OLD)</p>

<p>Tell CMake to use the OLD or NEW behavior for a given
policy. Projects depending on the old behavior of a given
policy may silence a policy warning by setting the policy
state to OLD. Alternatively one may fix the project to work
with the new behavior and set the policy state to NEW.</p>

<p>cmake_policy(GET CMP&lt;NNNN&gt; &lt;variable&gt;)</p>

<p>Check whether a given policy is set to OLD or NEW
behavior. The output variable value will be &quot;OLD&quot;
or &quot;NEW&quot; if the policy is set, and empty
otherwise.</p>

<p>CMake keeps policy settings on a stack, so changes made
by the cmake_policy command affect only the top of the
stack. A new entry on the policy stack is managed
automatically for each sub- directory to protect its parents
and siblings. CMake also man- ages a new entry for scripts
loaded by include() and find_pack- age() commands except
when invoked with the NO_POLICY_SCOPE option (see also
policy CMP0011). The cmake_policy command pro- vides an
interface to manage custom entries on the policy stack:</p>

<p>cmake_policy(PUSH) cmake_policy(POP)</p>

<p>Each PUSH must have a matching POP to erase any changes.
This is useful to make temporary changes to policy
settings.</p>

<p>Functions and macros record policy settings when they
are cre- ated and use the pre-record policies when they are
invoked. If the function or macro implementation sets
policies, the changes automatically propagate up through
callers until they reach the closest nested policy stack
entry.</p>

<p>configure_file Copy a file to another location and
modify its contents.</p>

<p>configure_file(InputFile OutputFile [COPYONLY]
[ESCAPE_QUOTES] [@ONLY])</p>

<p>The Input and Output files have to have full paths. This
com- mand replaces any variables in the input file
referenced as ${VAR} or @VAR@ with their values as
determined by CMake. If a variable is not defined, it will
be replaced with nothing. If COPYONLY is specified, then no
variable expansion will take place. If ESCAPE_QUOTES is
specified then any substituted quotes will be C-style
escaped. The file will be configured with the current values
of CMake variables. If @ONLY is speci- fied, only variables
of the form @VAR@ will be replaces and ${VAR} will be
ignored. This is useful for configuring scripts that use
${VAR}. Any occurrences of #cmakedefine VAR will be replaced
with either #define VAR or /* #undef VAR */ depending on the
setting of VAR in CMake</p>

<p>create_test_sourcelist Create a test driver and source
list for building test programs.</p>

<p>create_test_sourcelist(sourceListName driverName test1
test2 test3 EXTRA_INCLUDE include.h FUNCTION function)</p>

<p>A test driver is a program that links together many
small tests into a single executable. This is useful when
building static executables with large libraries to shrink
the total required size. The list of source files needed to
build the test driver will be in sourceListName. DriverName
is the name of the test driver program. The rest of the
arguments consist of a list of test source files, can be
semicolon separated. Each test source file should have a
function in it that is the same name as the file with no
extension (foo.cxx should have int foo(int, char*[]);)
DriverName will be able to call each of the tests by name on
the command line. If EXTRA_INCLUDE is specified, then the
next argument is included into the generated file. If FUNC-
TION is specified, then the next argument is taken as a
function name that is passed a pointer to ac and av. This
can be used to add extra command line processing to each
test. The cmake vari- able CMAKE_TESTDRIVER_BEFORE_TESTMAIN
can be set to have code that will be placed directly before
calling the test main func- tion.
CMAKE_TESTDRIVER_AFTER_TESTMAIN can be set to have code that
will be placed directly after the call to the test main
function.</p>

<p>define_property Define and document custom
properties.</p>

<p>define_property(&lt;GLOBAL | DIRECTORY | TARGET | SOURCE
| TEST | VARIABLE | CACHED_VARIABLE&gt; PROPERTY
&lt;name&gt; [INHERITED] BRIEF_DOCS &lt;brief-doc&gt;
FULL_DOCS &lt;full-doc&gt;)</p>

<p>Define one property in a scope for use with the
set_property and get_property commands. This is primarily
useful to associate documentation with property names that
may be retrieved with the get_property command. The first
argument determines the kind of scope in which the property
should be used. It must be one of the following:</p>

<p>GLOBAL = associated with the global namespace DIRECTORY
= associated with one directory TARGET = associated with one
target SOURCE = associated with one source file TEST =
associated with a test named with add_test command VARIABLE
= documents a CMake language variable CACHED_VARIABLE =
documents a CMake cache variable</p>

<p>Note that unlike set_property and get_property no actual
scope needs to be given; only the kind of scope is
important.</p>

<p>The required PROPERTY option is immediately followed by
the name of the property being defined.</p>

<p>If the INHERITED option then the get_property command
will chain up to the next higher scope when the requested
property is not set in the scope given to the command.
DIRECTORY scope chains to GLOBAL. TARGET, SOURCE, and TEST
chain to DIRECTORY.</p>

<p>The BRIEF_DOCS and FULL_DOCS options are followed by
strings to be associated with the property as its brief and
full documenta- tion. Corresponding options to the
get_property command will retrieve the documentation.</p>

<p>else Starts the else portion of an if block.</p>

<p>else(expression)</p>

<p>elseif Starts the elseif portion of an if block.</p>

<p>See the if command.</p>

<p>enable_language Enable a language
(CXX/C/Fortran/etc)</p>

<p>enable_language(languageName [OPTIONAL] )</p>

<p>This command enables support for the named language in
CMake. This is the same as the project command but does not
create any of the extra variables that are created by the
project command. Example languages are CXX, C, Fortran.</p>

<p>If OPTIONAL is used, use the
CMAKE_&lt;languageName&gt;_COMPILER_WORKS variable to check
whether the language has been enabled success- fully.</p>

<p>enable_testing Enable testing for current directory and
below.</p>

<p>enable_testing()</p>

<p>Enables testing for this directory and below. See also
the add_test command. Note that ctest expects to find a test
file in the build directory root. Therefore, this command
should be in the source directory root.</p>

[ERROR_FILE &lt;file&gt;] [OUTPUT_QUIET] [ERROR_QUIET]
[OUTPUT_STRIP_TRAILING_WHITESPACE]
[ERROR_STRIP_TRAILING_WHITESPACE])</p>

<p>Runs the given sequence of one or more commands with the
stan- dard output of each process piped to the standard
input of the next. A single standard error pipe is used for
all processes. If WORKING_DIRECTORY is given the named
directory will be set as the current working directory of
the child processes. If TIME- OUT is given the child
processes will be terminated if they do not finish in the
specified number of seconds (fractions are allowed). If
RESULT_VARIABLE is given the variable will be set to contain
the result of running the processes. This will be an integer
return code from the last child or a string describing an
error condition. If OUTPUT_VARIABLE or ERROR_VARIABLE are
given the variable named will be set with the contents of
the standard output and standard error pipes respectively.
If the same variable is named for both pipes their output
will be merged in the order produced. If INPUT_FILE,
OUTPUT_FILE, or ERROR_FILE is given the file named will be
attached to the stan- dard input of the first process,
standard output of the last process, or standard error of
all processes respectively. If OUTPUT_QUIET or ERROR_QUIET
is given then the standard output or standard error results
will be quietly ignored. If more than one OUTPUT_* or
ERROR_* option is given for the same pipe the precedence is
not specified. If no OUTPUT_* or ERROR_* options are given
the output will be shared with the corresponding pipes of
the CMake process itself.</p>

<p>The execute_process command is a newer more powerful
version of exec_program, but the old command has been kept
for compatibil- ity.</p>

<p>export Export targets from the build tree for use by
outside projects.</p>

<p>export(TARGETS [target1 [target2 [...]]] [NAMESPACE
&lt;namespace&gt;] [APPEND] FILE &lt;filename&gt;)</p>

<p>Create a file &lt;filename&gt; that may be included by
outside projects to import targets from the current projects
build tree. This is useful during cross-compiling to build
utility executables that can run on the host platform in one
project and then import them into another project being
compiled for the target platform. If the NAMESPACE option is
given the &lt;names- pace&gt; string will be prepended to
all target names written to the file. If the APPEND option
is given the generated code will be appended to the file
instead of overwriting it. If a library target is included
in the export but a target to which it links is not included
the behavior is unspecified.</p>

<p>The file created by this command is specific to the
build tree and should never be installed. See the
install(EXPORT) command to export targets from an
installation tree.</p>

<p>file File manipulation command.</p>

<p>file(WRITE filename &quot;message to write&quot;... )
file(APPEND filename &quot;message to write&quot;... )
file(READ filename variable [LIMIT numBytes] [OFFSET offset]
[HEX]) file(STRINGS filename variable [LIMIT_COUNT num]
[LIMIT_INPUT numBytes] [LIMIT_OUTPUT numBytes]
[LENGTH_MINIMUM numBytes] [LENGTH_MAXIMUM numBytes]
[NEWLINE_CONSUME] [REGEX regex] [NO_HEX_CONVERSION])

file(RELATIVE_PATH variable directory file)
file(TO_CMAKE_PATH path result) file(TO_NATIVE_PATH path
result) file(DOWNLOAD url file [TIMEOUT timeout] [STATUS
status] [LOG log])</p>

<p>WRITE will write a message into a file called filename.
It overwrites the file if it already exists, and creates the
file if it does not exist.</p>

<p>APPEND will write a message into a file same as WRITE,
except it will append it to the end of the file</p>

<p>READ will read the content of a file and store it into
the vari- able. It will start at the given offset and read
up to numBytes. If the argument HEX is given, the binary
data will be converted to hexadecimal representation and
this will be stored in the variable.</p>

<p>STRINGS will parse a list of ASCII strings from a file
and store it in a variable. Binary data in the file are
ignored. Carriage return (CR) characters are ignored. It
works also for Intel Hex and Motorola S-record files, which
are automatically converted to binary format when reading
them. Disable this using NO_HEX_CONVERSION.</p>

<p>LIMIT_COUNT sets the maximum number of strings to
return. LIMIT_INPUT sets the maximum number of bytes to read
from the input file. LIMIT_OUTPUT sets the maximum number of
bytes to store in the output variable. LENGTH_MINIMUM sets
the minimum length of a string to return. Shorter strings
are ignored. LENGTH_MAXIMUM sets the maximum length of a
string to return. Longer strings are split into strings no
longer than the maximum length. NEWLINE_CONSUME allows
newlines to be included in strings instead of terminating
them.</p>

<p>REGEX specifies a regular expression that a string must
match to be returned. Typical usage</p>

<p>file(STRINGS myfile.txt myfile)</p>

<p>stores a list in the variable &quot;myfile&quot; in
which each item is a line from the input file.</p>

<p>GLOB will generate a list of all files that match the
globbing expressions and store it into the variable.
Globbing expressions are similar to regular expressions, but
much simpler. If RELA- TIVE flag is specified for an
expression, the results will be returned as a relative path
to the given path.</p>

<p>Examples of globbing expressions include:</p>

<p>*.cxx - match all files with extension cxx *.vt? - match
all files with extension vta,...,vtz f[3-5].txt - match
files f3.txt, f4.txt, f5.txt</p>

<p>GLOB_RECURSE will generate a list similar to the regular
GLOB, except it will traverse all the subdirectories of the
matched directory and match the files. Subdirectories that
are symlinks are only traversed if FOLLOW_SYMLINKS is given
or cmake policy CMP0009 is not set to NEW. See cmake
--help-policy CMP0009 for more information.</p>

<p>Examples of recursive globbing include:</p>

<p>/dir/*.py - match all python files in /dir and
subdirectories</p>

<p>MAKE_DIRECTORY will create the given directories, also
if their parent directories dont exist yet</p>

<p>REMOVE will remove the given files, also in
subdirectories</p>

<p>REMOVE_RECURSE will remove the given files and
directories, also non-empty directories</p>

<p>RELATIVE_PATH will determine relative path from
directory to the given file.</p>

<p>TO_CMAKE_PATH will convert path into a cmake style path
with unix /. The input can be a single path or a system path
like &quot;$ENV{PATH}&quot;. Note the double quotes around
the ENV call TO_CMAKE_PATH only takes one argument.</p>

<p>TO_NATIVE_PATH works just like TO_CMAKE_PATH, but will
convert from a cmake style path into the native path style
for win- dows and / for UNIX.</p>

<p>DOWNLOAD will download the given URL to the given file.
If LOG var is specified a log of the download will be put in
var. If STATUS var is specified the status of the operation
will be put in var. The status is returned in a list of
length 2. The first element is the numeric return value for
the operation, and the second element is a string value for
the error. A 0 numeric error means no error in the
operation. If TIMEOUT time is speci- fied, the operation
will timeout after time seconds, time can be specified as a
float.</p>

<p>find_file Find the full path to a file.</p>

<p>find_path(&lt;VAR&gt; name1 [path1 path2 ...])</p>

<p>This is the short-hand signature for the command that is
sufficient in many cases. It is the same as
find_path(&lt;VAR&gt; name1 [PATHS path1 path2 ...])</p>

<p>find_path( &lt;VAR&gt; name | NAMES name1 [name2 ...]
[HINTS path1 [path2 ... ENV var]] [PATHS path1 [path2 ...
ENV var]] [PATH_SUFFIXES suffix1 [suffix2 ...]] [DOC
&quot;cache documentation string&quot;] [NO_DEFAULT_PATH]
[NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH] [NO_CMAKE_PATH]
[NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH] [NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH]
[CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH | ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH |
NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH] )</p>

<p>This command is used to find a full path to named file.
A cache entry named by &lt;VAR&gt; is created to store the
result of this com- mand. If the full path to a file is
found the result is stored in the variable and the search
will not be repeated unless the variable is cleared. If
nothing is found, the result will be &lt;VAR&gt;-NOTFOUND,
and the search will be attempted again the next time
find_path is invoked with the same variable. The name of the
full path to a file that is searched for is specified by the
names listed after the NAMES argument. Additional search
loca- tions can be specified after the PATHS argument. If
ENV var is found in the HINTS or PATHS section the
environment variable var will be read and converted from a
system environment variable to a cmake style list of paths.
For example ENV PATH would be a way to list the system path
variable. The argument after DOC will be used for the
documentation string in the cache. PATH_SUFFIXES specifies
additional subdirectories to check below each search
path.</p>

<p>If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is specified, then no additional
paths are added to the search. If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is not
specified, the search process is as follows:</p>

<p>1. Search paths specified in cmake-specific cache
variables. These are intended to be used on the command line
with a -DVAR=value. This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_PATH is
passed.</p>

<p>&lt;prefix&gt;/include for each &lt;prefix&gt; in
CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH
CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH</p>

<p>2. Search paths specified in cmake-specific environment
vari- ables. These are intended to be set in the user s
shell config- uration. This can be skipped if
NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is passed.</p>

<p>&lt;prefix&gt;/include for each &lt;prefix&gt; in
CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH
CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH</p>

<p>3. Search the paths specified by the HINTS option. These
should be paths computed by system introspection, such as a
hint pro- vided by the location of another item already
found. Hard-coded guesses should be specified with the PATHS
option.</p>

<p>4. Search the standard system environment variables.
This can be skipped if NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is an
argument.</p>

<p>PATH INCLUDE</p>

<p>5. Search cmake variables defined in the Platform files
for the current system. This can be skipped if
NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH is passed.</p>

<p>&lt;prefix&gt;/include for each &lt;prefix&gt; in
CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH
CMAKE_SYSTEM_FRAMEWORK_PATH</p>

<p>6. Search the paths specified by the PATHS option or in
the short-hand version of the command. These are typically
hard-coded guesses.</p>

<p>On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Frameworks, the
cmake vari- able CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK can be set to empty or
one of the following:</p>

<p>&quot;FIRST&quot; - Try to find frameworks before
standard libraries or headers. This is the default on
Darwin. &quot;LAST&quot; - Try to find frameworks after
standard libraries or headers. &quot;ONLY&quot; - Only try
to find frameworks. &quot;NEVER&quot;. - Never try to find
frameworks.</p>

<p>On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Application
Bundles, the cmake variable CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE can be set
to empty or one of the following:</p>

<p>&quot;FIRST&quot; - Try to find application bundles
before standard programs. This is the default on Darwin.
&quot;LAST&quot; - Try to find application bundles after
standard programs. &quot;ONLY&quot; - Only try to find
application bundles. &quot;NEVER&quot;. - Never try to find
application bundles.</p>

<p>The CMake variable CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH specifies one or
more directories to be prepended to all other search
directories. This effectively &quot;re-roots&quot; the
entire search under given loca- tions. By default it is
empty. It is especially useful when cross-compiling to point
to the root directory of the target environment and CMake
will search there too. By default at first the directories
listed in CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH and then the non-rooted
directories will be searched. The default behavior can be
adjusted by setting CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_INCLUDE. This
behavior can be manually overridden on a per-call basis. By
using CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH the search order will be as
described above. If NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then
CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH will not be used. If
ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then only the re-rooted
direc- tories will be searched.</p>

<p>The default search order is designed to be most-specific
to least-specific for common use cases. Projects may
override the order by simply calling the command multiple
times and using the NO_* options:</p>

<p>find_path(&lt;VAR&gt; NAMES name PATHS paths...
NO_DEFAULT_PATH) find_path(&lt;VAR&gt; NAMES name)</p>

<p>Once one of the calls succeeds the result variable will
be set and stored in the cache so that no call will search
again.</p>

<p>find_library Find a library.</p>

<p>find_library(&lt;VAR&gt; name1 [path1 path2 ...])</p>

<p>This is the short-hand signature for the command that is
suffi- cient in many cases. It is the same as
find_library(&lt;VAR&gt; name1 [PATHS path1 path2 ...])</p>

<p>find_library( &lt;VAR&gt; name | NAMES name1 [name2 ...]
[HINTS path1 [path2 ... ENV var]] [PATHS path1 [path2 ...
ENV var]] [PATH_SUFFIXES suffix1 [suffix2 ...]] [DOC
&quot;cache documentation string&quot;] [NO_DEFAULT_PATH]
[NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH] [NO_CMAKE_PATH]
[NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH] [NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH]
[CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH | ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH |
NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH] )</p>

<p>This command is used to find a library. A cache entry
named by &lt;VAR&gt; is created to store the result of this
command. If the library is found the result is stored in the
variable and the search will not be repeated unless the
variable is cleared. If nothing is found, the result will be
&lt;VAR&gt;-NOTFOUND, and the search will be attempted again
the next time find_library is invoked with the same
variable. The name of the library that is searched for is
specified by the names listed after the NAMES argument.
Additional search locations can be specified after the PATHS
argument. If ENV var is found in the HINTS or PATHS section
the environment variable var will be read and converted from
a system environment variable to a cmake style list of
paths. For example ENV PATH would be a way to list the
system path variable. The argument after DOC will be used
for the docu- mentation string in the cache. PATH_SUFFIXES
specifies addi- tional subdirectories to check below each
search path.</p>

<p>If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is specified, then no additional
paths are added to the search. If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is not
specified, the search process is as follows:</p>

<p>1. Search paths specified in cmake-specific cache
variables. These are intended to be used on the command line
with a -DVAR=value. This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_PATH is
passed.</p>

<p>&lt;prefix&gt;/lib for each &lt;prefix&gt; in
CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH
CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH</p>

<p>2. Search paths specified in cmake-specific environment
vari- ables. These are intended to be set in the user s
shell config- uration. This can be skipped if
NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is passed.</p>

<p>&lt;prefix&gt;/lib for each &lt;prefix&gt; in
CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH
CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH</p>

<p>3. Search the paths specified by the HINTS option. These
should be paths computed by system introspection, such as a
hint pro- vided by the location of another item already
found. Hard-coded guesses should be specified with the PATHS
option.</p>

<p>4. Search the standard system environment variables.
This can be skipped if NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is an
argument.</p>

<p>PATH LIB</p>

<p>5. Search cmake variables defined in the Platform files
for the current system. This can be skipped if
NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH is passed.</p>

<p>&lt;prefix&gt;/lib for each &lt;prefix&gt; in
CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH
CMAKE_SYSTEM_FRAMEWORK_PATH</p>

<p>6. Search the paths specified by the PATHS option or in
the short-hand version of the command. These are typically
hard-coded guesses.</p>

<p>On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Frameworks, the
cmake vari- able CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK can be set to empty or
one of the following:</p>

<p>&quot;FIRST&quot; - Try to find frameworks before
standard libraries or headers. This is the default on
Darwin. &quot;LAST&quot; - Try to find frameworks after
standard libraries or headers. &quot;ONLY&quot; - Only try
to find frameworks. &quot;NEVER&quot;. - Never try to find
frameworks.</p>

<p>On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Application
Bundles, the cmake variable CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE can be set
to empty or one of the following:</p>

<p>&quot;FIRST&quot; - Try to find application bundles
before standard programs. This is the default on Darwin.
&quot;LAST&quot; - Try to find application bundles after
standard programs. &quot;ONLY&quot; - Only try to find
application bundles. &quot;NEVER&quot;. - Never try to find
application bundles.</p>

<p>The CMake variable CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH specifies one or
more directories to be prepended to all other search
directories. This effectively &quot;re-roots&quot; the
entire search under given loca- tions. By default it is
empty. It is especially useful when cross-compiling to point
to the root directory of the target environment and CMake
will search there too. By default at first the directories
listed in CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH and then the non-rooted
directories will be searched. The default behavior can be
adjusted by setting CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_LIBRARY. This
behavior can be manually overridden on a per-call basis. By
using CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH the search order will be as
described above. If NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then
CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH will not be used. If
ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then only the re-rooted
direc- tories will be searched.</p>

<p>The default search order is designed to be most-specific
to least-specific for common use cases. Projects may
override the order by simply calling the command multiple
times and using the NO_* options:</p>

<p>find_library(&lt;VAR&gt; NAMES name PATHS paths...
NO_DEFAULT_PATH) find_library(&lt;VAR&gt; NAMES name)</p>

<p>Once one of the calls succeeds the result variable will
be set and stored in the cache so that no call will search
again.</p>

<p>If the library found is a framework, then VAR will be
set to the full path to the framework
&lt;fullPath&gt;/A.framework. When a full path to a
framework is used as a library, CMake will use a -framework
A, and a -F&lt;fullPath&gt; to link the framework to the
target.</p>

<p>find_package Load settings for an external project.</p>

<p>find_package(&lt;package&gt; [version] [EXACT] [QUIET]
[[REQUIRED|COMPONENTS] [components...]]
[NO_POLICY_SCOPE])</p>

<p>Finds and loads settings from an external project.
&lt;pack- age&gt;_FOUND will be set to indicate whether the
package was found. When the package is found
package-specific information is provided through variables
documented by the package itself. The QUIET option disables
messages if the package cannot be found. The REQUIRED option
stops processing with an error mes- sage if the package
cannot be found. A package-specific list of components may
be listed after the REQUIRED option or after the COMPONENTS
option if no REQUIRED option is given. The [version]
argument requests a version with which the package found
should be compatible (format is
major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]]). The EXACT option requests
that the version be matched exactly. If no [version] is
given to a recursive invocation inside a find-module, the
[version] and EXACT arguments are forwarded automatically
from the outer call. Version support is currently provided
only on a package-by-package basis (details below).</p>

<p>User code should generally look for packages using the
above simple signature. The remainder of this command
documentation specifies the full command signature and
details of the search process. Project maintainers wishing
to provide a package to be found by this command are
encouraged to read on.</p>

<p>The command has two modes by which it searches for
packages: &quot;Module&quot; mode and &quot;Config&quot;
mode. Module mode is available when the command is invoked
with the above reduced signature. CMake searches for a file
called &quot;Find&lt;package&gt;.cmake&quot; in the
CMAKE_MODULE_PATH followed by the CMake installation. If the
file is found, it is read and processed by CMake. It is
respon- sible for finding the package, checking the version,
and produc- ing any needed messages. Many find-modules
provide limited or no support for versioning; check the
module documentation. If no module is found the command
proceeds to Config mode.</p>

<p>The complete Config mode command signature is:</p>

<p>find_package(&lt;package&gt; [version] [EXACT] [QUIET]
[[REQUIRED|COMPONENTS] [components...]] [NO_MODULE]
[NO_POLICY_SCOPE] [NAMES name1 [name2 ...]] [CONFIGS config1
[config2 ...]] [HINTS path1 [path2 ... ]] [PATHS path1
[path2 ... ]] [PATH_SUFFIXES suffix1 [suffix2 ...]]
[NO_DEFAULT_PATH] [NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
[NO_CMAKE_PATH] [NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
[NO_CMAKE_BUILDS_PATH] [NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH]
[CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH | ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH |
NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH])</p>

<p>The NO_MODULE option may be used to skip Module mode
explicitly. It is also implied by use of options not
specified in the reduced signature.</p>

<p>Config mode attempts to locate a configuration file
provided by the package to be found. A cache entry called
&lt;package&gt;_DIR is created to hold the directory
containing the file. By default the command searches for a
package with the name &lt;package&gt;. If the NAMES option
is given the names following it are used instead of
&lt;package&gt;. The command searches for a file called
&quot;&lt;name&gt;Config.cmake&quot; or
&quot;&lt;lower-case-name&gt;-config.cmake&quot; for each
name specified. A replacement set of possible configura-
tion file names may be given using the CONFIGS option. The
search procedure is specified below. Once found, the
configura- tion file is read and processed by CMake. Since
the file is provided by the package it already knows the
location of package contents. The full path to the
configuration file is stored in the cmake variable
&lt;package&gt;_CONFIG.</p>

<p>If the package configuration file cannot be found CMake
will generate an error describing the problem unless the
QUIET argu- ment is specified. If REQUIRED is specified and
the package is not found a fatal error is generated and the
configure step stops executing. If &lt;package&gt;_DIR has
been set to a directory not containing a configuration file
CMake will ignore it and search from scratch.</p>

<p>When the [version] argument is given Config mode will
only find a version of the package that claims compatibility
with the requested version (format is
major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]]). If the EXACT option is given
only a version of the package claiming an exact match of the
requested version may be found. CMake does not establish any
convention for the meaning of version numbers. Package
version numbers are checked by &quot;version&quot; files
provided by the packages themselves. For a candidate package
confguration file &quot;&lt;config-file&gt;.cmake&quot; the
corresponding ver- sion file is located next to it and named
either &quot;&lt;con- fig-file&gt;-version.cmake&quot; or
&quot;&lt;config-file&gt;Version.cmake&quot;. If no such
version file is available then the configuration file is
assumed to not be compatible with any requested version.
When a version file is found it is loaded to check the
requested ver- sion number. The version file is loaded in a
nested scope in which the following variables have been
defined:</p>

<p>PACKAGE_FIND_NAME = the &lt;package&gt; name
PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION = full requested version string
PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_MAJOR = major version if requested,
else 0 PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_MINOR = minor version if
requested, else 0 PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_PATCH = patch version
if requested, else 0 PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_TWEAK = tweak
version if requested, else 0 PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_COUNT =
number of version components, 0 to 4</p>

<p>The version file checks whether it satisfies the
requested ver- sion and sets these variables:</p>

<p>PACKAGE_VERSION = full provided version string
PACKAGE_VERSION_EXACT = true if version is exact match
PACKAGE_VERSION_COMPATIBLE = true if version is compatible
PACKAGE_VERSION_UNSUITABLE = true if unsuitable as any
version</p>

<p>These variables are checked by the find_package command
to determine whether the configuration file provides an
acceptable version. They are not available after the
find_package call returns. If the version is acceptable the
following variables are set:</p>

<p>&lt;package&gt;_VERSION = full provided version string
&lt;package&gt;_VERSION_MAJOR = major version if provided,
else 0 &lt;package&gt;_VERSION_MINOR = minor version if
provided, else 0 &lt;package&gt;_VERSION_PATCH = patch
version if provided, else 0 &lt;package&gt;_VERSION_TWEAK =
tweak version if provided, else 0
&lt;package&gt;_VERSION_COUNT = number of version
components, 0 to 4</p>

<p>and the corresponding package configuration file is
loaded. When multiple package configuration files are
available whose version files claim compatibility with the
version requested it is unspecified which one is chosen. No
attempt is made to choose a highest or closest version
number.</p>

<p>Config mode provides an elaborate interface and search
proce- dure. Much of the interface is provided for
completeness and for use internally by find-modules loaded
by Module mode. Most user code should simply call</p>

<p>find_package(&lt;package&gt; [major[.minor]] [EXACT]
[REQUIRED|QUIET])</p>

<p>in order to find a package. Package maintainers
providing CMake package configuration files are encouraged
to name and install them such that the procedure outlined
below will find them with- out requiring use of additional
options.</p>

<p>CMake constructs a set of possible installation prefixes
for the package. Under each prefix several directories are
searched for a configuration file. The tables below show the
directories searched. Each entry is meant for installation
trees following Windows (W), UNIX (U), or Apple (A)
conventions.</p>

<p>&lt;prefix&gt;/ (W) &lt;prefix&gt;/(cmake|CMake)/ (W)
&lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;name&gt;*/ (W)
&lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;name&gt;*/(cmake|CMake)/ (W)
&lt;prefix&gt;/(share|lib)/cmake/&lt;name&gt;*/ (U)
&lt;prefix&gt;/(share|lib)/&lt;name&gt;*/ (U)
&lt;prefix&gt;/(share|lib)/&lt;name&gt;*/(cmake|CMake)/
(U)</p>

<p>On systems supporting OS X Frameworks and Application
Bundles the following directories are searched for
frameworks or bundles containing a configuration file:</p>

<p>&lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;name&gt;.framework/Resources/ (A)
&lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;name&gt;.framework/Resources/CMake/ (A)
&lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;name&gt;.framework/Versions/*/Resources/
(A)
&lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;name&gt;.framework/Versions/*/Resources/CMake/
(A) &lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;name&gt;.app/Contents/Resources/ (A)
&lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;name&gt;.app/Contents/Resources/CMake/
(A)</p>

<p>In all cases the &lt;name&gt; is treated as
case-insensitive and cor- responds to any of the names
specified (&lt;package&gt; or names given by NAMES). If
PATH_SUFFIXES is specified the suffixes are appended to each
(W) or (U) directory entry one-by-one.</p>

<p>This set of directories is intended to work in
cooperation with projects that provide configuration files
in their installation trees. Directories above marked with
(W) are intended for installations on Windows where the
prefix may point at the top of an applications installation
directory. Those marked with (U) are intended for
installations on UNIX platforms where the prefix is shared
by multiple packages. This is merely a conven- tion, so all
(W) and (U) directories are still searched on all platforms.
Directories marked with (A) are intended for instal- lations
on Apple platforms. The cmake variables CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK
and CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE determine the order of preference
as specified below.</p>

<p>The set of installation prefixes is constructed using
the fol- lowing steps. If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is specified all
NO_* options are enabled.</p>

<p>1. Search paths specified in cmake-specific cache
variables. These are intended to be used on the command line
with a -DVAR=value. This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_PATH is
passed.</p>

<p>CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH
CMAKE_APPBUNDLE_PATH</p>

<p>2. Search paths specified in cmake-specific environment
vari- ables. These are intended to be set in the users shell
config- uration. This can be skipped if
NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is passed.</p>

<p>CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH
CMAKE_APPBUNDLE_PATH</p>

<p>3. Search paths specified by the HINTS option. These
should be paths computed by system introspection, such as a
hint provided by the location of another item already found.
Hard-coded guesses should be specified with the PATHS
option.</p>

<p>4. Search the standard system environment variables.
This can be skipped if NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is passed.
Path entries ending in &quot;/bin&quot; or &quot;/sbin&quot;
are automatically converted to their parent directories.</p>

<p>PATH</p>

<p>5. Search project build trees recently configured in a
CMake GUI. This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_BUILDS_PATH is
passed. It is intended for the case when a user is building
multiple depen- dent projects one after another.</p>

<p>6. Search cmake variables defined in the Platform files
for the current system. This can be skipped if
NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH is passed.</p>

<p>CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH CMAKE_SYSTEM_FRAMEWORK_PATH
CMAKE_SYSTEM_APPBUNDLE_PATH</p>

<p>7. Search paths specified by the PATHS option. These are
typi- cally hard-coded guesses.</p>

<p>On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Frameworks, the
cmake vari- able CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK can be set to empty or
one of the following:</p>

<p>&quot;FIRST&quot; - Try to find frameworks before
standard libraries or headers. This is the default on
Darwin. &quot;LAST&quot; - Try to find frameworks after
standard libraries or headers. &quot;ONLY&quot; - Only try
to find frameworks. &quot;NEVER&quot;. - Never try to find
frameworks.</p>

<p>On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Application
Bundles, the cmake variable CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE can be set
to empty or one of the following:</p>

<p>&quot;FIRST&quot; - Try to find application bundles
before standard programs. This is the default on Darwin.
&quot;LAST&quot; - Try to find application bundles after
standard programs. &quot;ONLY&quot; - Only try to find
application bundles. &quot;NEVER&quot;. - Never try to find
application bundles.</p>

<p>The CMake variable CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH specifies one or
more directories to be prepended to all other search
directories. This effectively &quot;re-roots&quot; the
entire search under given loca- tions. By default it is
empty. It is especially useful when cross-compiling to point
to the root directory of the target environment and CMake
will search there too. By default at first the directories
listed in CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH and then the non-rooted
directories will be searched. The default behavior can be
adjusted by setting CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PACKAGE. This
behavior can be manually overridden on a per-call basis. By
using CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH the search order will be as
described above. If NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then
CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH will not be used. If
ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then only the re-rooted
direc- tories will be searched.</p>

<p>The default search order is designed to be most-specific
to least-specific for common use cases. Projects may
override the order by simply calling the command multiple
times and using the NO_* options:</p>

<p>find_package(&lt;package&gt; PATHS paths...
NO_DEFAULT_PATH) find_package(&lt;package&gt;)</p>

<p>Once one of the calls succeeds the result variable will
be set and stored in the cache so that no call will search
again.</p>

<p>See the cmake_policy() command documentation for
discussion of the NO_POLICY_SCOPE option.</p>

<p>find_path Find the directory containing a file.</p>

<p>find_path(&lt;VAR&gt; name1 [path1 path2 ...])</p>

<p>This is the short-hand signature for the command that is
suffi- cient in many cases. It is the same as
find_path(&lt;VAR&gt; name1 [PATHS path1 path2 ...])</p>

<p>find_path( &lt;VAR&gt; name | NAMES name1 [name2 ...]
[HINTS path1 [path2 ... ENV var]] [PATHS path1 [path2 ...
ENV var]] [PATH_SUFFIXES suffix1 [suffix2 ...]] [DOC
&quot;cache documentation string&quot;] [NO_DEFAULT_PATH]
[NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH] [NO_CMAKE_PATH]
[NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH] [NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH]
[CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH | ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH |
NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH] )</p>

<p>This command is used to find a directory containing the
named file. A cache entry named by &lt;VAR&gt; is created to
store the result of this command. If the file in a directory
is found the result is stored in the variable and the search
will not be repeated unless the variable is cleared. If
nothing is found, the result will be &lt;VAR&gt;-NOTFOUND,
and the search will be attempted again the next time
find_path is invoked with the same variable. The name of the
file in a directory that is searched for is specified by the
names listed after the NAMES argument. Additional search
locations can be specified after the PATHS argument. If ENV
var is found in the HINTS or PATHS section the environment
variable var will be read and converted from a sys- tem
environment variable to a cmake style list of paths. For
example ENV PATH would be a way to list the system path
vari- able. The argument after DOC will be used for the
documentation string in the cache. PATH_SUFFIXES specifies
additional subdi- rectories to check below each search
path.</p>

<p>If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is specified, then no additional
paths are added to the search. If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is not
specified, the search process is as follows:</p>

<p>1. Search paths specified in cmake-specific cache
variables. These are intended to be used on the command line
with a -DVAR=value. This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_PATH is
passed.</p>

<p>&lt;prefix&gt;/include for each &lt;prefix&gt; in
CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH
CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH</p>

<p>2. Search paths specified in cmake-specific environment
vari- ables. These are intended to be set in the users shell
config- uration. This can be skipped if
NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is passed.</p>

<p>&lt;prefix&gt;/include for each &lt;prefix&gt; in
CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH
CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH</p>

<p>3. Search the paths specified by the HINTS option. These
should be paths computed by system introspection, such as a
hint pro- vided by the location of another item already
found. Hard-coded guesses should be specified with the PATHS
option.</p>

<p>4. Search the standard system environment variables.
This can be skipped if NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is an
argument.</p>

<p>PATH INCLUDE</p>

<p>5. Search cmake variables defined in the Platform files
for the current system. This can be skipped if
NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH is passed.</p>

<p>&lt;prefix&gt;/include for each &lt;prefix&gt; in
CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH
CMAKE_SYSTEM_FRAMEWORK_PATH</p>

<p>6. Search the paths specified by the PATHS option or in
the short-hand version of the command. These are typically
hard-coded guesses.</p>

<p>On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Frameworks, the
cmake vari- able CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK can be set to empty or
one of the following:</p>

<p>&quot;FIRST&quot; - Try to find frameworks before

Darwin. &quot;LAST&quot; - Try to find frameworks after
standard libraries or headers. &quot;ONLY&quot; - Only try
to find frameworks. &quot;NEVER&quot;. - Never try to find
frameworks.</p>

<p>On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Application
Bundles, the cmake variable CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE can be set
to empty or one of the following:</p>

<p>&quot;FIRST&quot; - Try to find application bundles
before standard programs. This is the default on Darwin.
&quot;LAST&quot; - Try to find application bundles after
standard programs. &quot;ONLY&quot; - Only try to find
application bundles. &quot;NEVER&quot;. - Never try to find
application bundles.</p>

<p>The CMake variable CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH specifies one or

directories. This effectively &quot;re-roots&quot; the
entire search under given loca- tions. By default it is
empty. It is especially useful when cross-compiling to point
to the root directory of the target environment and CMake
will search there too. By default at first the directories
listed in CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH and then the non-rooted
directories will be searched. The default behavior can be

behavior can be manually overridden on a per-call basis. By
using CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH the search order will be as
described above. If NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then
CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH will not be used. If
ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then only the re-rooted
direc- tories will be searched.</p>

<p>The default search order is designed to be most-specific

times and using the NO_* options:</p>

<p>find_path(&lt;VAR&gt; NAMES name PATHS paths...
NO_DEFAULT_PATH) find_path(&lt;VAR&gt; NAMES name)</p>

<p>Once one of the calls succeeds the result variable will
be set and stored in the cache so that no call will search
again.</p>

<p>When searching for frameworks, if the file is specified
as A/b.h, then the framework search will look for
A.framework/Head- ers/b.h. If that is found the path will be
set to the path to the framework. CMake will convert this to
the correct -F option to include the file.</p>

<p>find_program Find an executable program.</p>

<p>find_program(&lt;VAR&gt; name1 [path1 path2 ...])</p>

<p>This is the short-hand signature for the command that is
suffi- cient in many cases. It is the same as
find_program(&lt;VAR&gt; name1 [PATHS path1 path2 ...])</p>

<p>find_program( &lt;VAR&gt; name | NAMES name1 [name2 ...]
[HINTS path1 [path2 ... ENV var]] [PATHS path1 [path2 ...
ENV var]] [PATH_SUFFIXES suffix1 [suffix2 ...]] [DOC
&quot;cache documentation string&quot;] [NO_DEFAULT_PATH]
[NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH] [NO_CMAKE_PATH]
[NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH] [NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH]
[CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH | ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH |
NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH] )</p>

<p>This command is used to find a program. A cache entry
named by &lt;VAR&gt; is created to store the result of this
command. If the program is found the result is stored in the
variable and the search will not be repeated unless the
variable is cleared. If nothing is found, the result will be
&lt;VAR&gt;-NOTFOUND, and the search will be attempted again
the next time find_program is invoked with the same
variable. The name of the program that is searched for is
specified by the names listed after the NAMES argument.
Additional search locations can be specified after the PATHS
argument. If ENV var is found in the HINTS or PATHS section
the environment variable var will be read and converted from
a system environment variable to a cmake style list of
paths. For example ENV PATH would be a way to list the
system path variable. The argument after DOC will be used
for the docu- mentation string in the cache. PATH_SUFFIXES
specifies addi- tional subdirectories to check below each
search path.</p>

<p>If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is specified, then no additional
paths are added to the search. If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is not
specified, the search process is as follows:</p>

<p>1. Search paths specified in cmake-specific cache
variables. These are intended to be used on the command line
with a -DVAR=value. This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_PATH is
passed.</p>

<p>2. Search paths specified in cmake-specific environment
vari- ables. These are intended to be set in the users shell
configuration. This can be skipped if
NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is passed.</p>

<p>On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Application
Bundles, the cmake variable CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE can be set
to empty or one of the following:</p>

<p>&quot;FIRST&quot; - Try to find application bundles
before standard programs. This is the default on Darwin.
&quot;LAST&quot; - Try to find application bundles after
standard programs. &quot;ONLY&quot; - Only try to find

again.</p>

<p>fltk_wrap_ui Create FLTK user interfaces Wrappers.</p>

<p>fltk_wrap_ui(resultingLibraryName source1 source2 ...
sourceN )</p>

<p>Produce .h and .cxx files for all the .fl and .fld files
listed. The resulting .h and .cxx files will be added to a
variable named resultingLibraryName_FLTK_UI_SRCS which
should be added to your library.</p>

<p>foreach Evaluate a group of commands for each value in a
list.</p>

<p>foreach(loop_var arg1 arg2 ...) COMMAND1(ARGS ...)
COMMAND2(ARGS ...) ... endforeach(loop_var) foreach(loop_var
RANGE total) foreach(loop_var RANGE start stop [step])</p>

<p>All commands between foreach and the matching endforeach
are recorded without being invoked. Once the endforeach is
evalu- ated, the recorded list of commands is invoked once
for each argument listed in the original foreach command.
Before each iteration of the loop &quot;${loop_var}&quot;
will be set as a variable with the current value in the
list.</p>

<p>Foreach can also iterate over a generated range of
numbers. There are three types of this iteration:</p>

<p>* When specifying single number, the range will have
elements 0 to &quot;total&quot;.</p>

<p>* When specifying two numbers, the range will have
elements from the first number to the second number.</p>

<p>* The third optional number is the increment used to
iterate from the first number to the second number.</p>

<p>function Start recording a function for later invocation
as a command.</p>

<p>function(&lt;name&gt; [arg1 [arg2 [arg3 ...]]])
COMMAND1(ARGS ...) COMMAND2(ARGS ...) ...
endfunction(&lt;name&gt;)</p>

<p>Define a function named &lt;name&gt; that takes
arguments named arg1 arg2 arg3 (...). Commands listed after
function, but before the matching endfunction, are not
invoked until the function is invoked. When it is invoked,
the commands recorded in the func- tion are first modified
by replacing formal parameters (${arg1}) with the arguments
passed, and then invoked as normal commands. In addition to
referencing the formal parameters you can refer- ence the
variable ARGC which will be set to the number of argu- ments
passed into the function as well as ARGV0 ARGV1 ARGV2 ...
which will have the actual values of the arguments passed
in. This facilitates creating functions with optional
arguments. Additionally ARGV holds the list of all arguments
given to the function and ARGN holds the list of argument
pass the last expected argument.</p>

<p>See the cmake_policy() command documentation for the
behavior of policies inside functions.</p>

<p>get_cmake_property Get a property of the CMake
instance.</p>

<p>get_cmake_property(VAR property)</p>

<p>Get a property from the CMake instance. The value of the
prop- erty is stored in the variable VAR. If the property is
not found, CMake will report an error. Some supported
properties include: VARIABLES, CACHE_VARIABLES, COMMANDS,
MACROS, and COM- PONENTS.</p>

<p>get_directory_property Get a property of the
directory.</p>

<p>get_directory_property(VAR [DIRECTORY dir] property)</p>

<p>Get a property from the Directory. The value of the
property is stored in the variable VAR. If the property is
not found, CMake will report an error. The properties
include: VARIABLES, CACHE_VARIABLES, COMMANDS, MACROS,
INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES, LINK_DIRECTORIES, DEFINITIONS,
INCLUDE_REGULAR_EXPRESSION, LIST- FILE_STACK,
PARENT_DIRECTORY, and DEFINITION varname. If the DIRECTORY
argument is provided then the property of the provided
directory will be retrieved instead of the current
directory. You can only get properties of a directory during
or after it has been traversed by cmake.</p>

<p>get_filename_component Get a specific component of a
full filename.</p>

<p>get_filename_component(VarName FileName
PATH|ABSOLUTE|NAME|EXT|NAME_WE|REALPATH [CACHE])</p>

<p>Set VarName to be the path (PATH), file name (NAME),
file exten- sion (EXT), file name without extension
(NAME_WE) of FileName, the full path (ABSOLUTE), or the full
path with all symlinks resolved (REALPATH). Note that the
path is converted to Unix slashes format and has no trailing
slashes. The longest file extension is always considered. If
the optional CACHE argument is specified, the result
variable is added to the cache.</p>

<p>get_filename_component(VarName FileName PROGRAM
[PROGRAM_ARGS ArgVar] [CACHE])</p>

<p>The program in FileName will be found in the system
search path or left as a full path. If PROGRAM_ARGS is
present with PROGRAM, then any command-line arguments
present in the FileName string are split from the program
name and stored in ArgVar. This is used to separate a
program name from its arguments in a command line
string.</p>

<p>get_property Get a property.</p>

<p>get_property(&lt;variable&gt; &lt;GLOBAL | DIRECTORY
[dir] | TARGET &lt;target&gt; | SOURCE &lt;source&gt; | TEST
&lt;test&gt; | VARIABLE&gt; PROPERTY &lt;name&gt; [SET |
DEFINED | BRIEF_DOCS | FULL_DOCS])</p>

<p>Get one property from one object in a scope. The first
argument specifies the variable in which to store the
result. The second argument determines the scope from which
to get the property. It must be one of the following:</p>

<p>GLOBAL scope is unique and does not accept a name.</p>

<p>DIRECTORY scope defaults to the current directory but
another directory (already processed by CMake) may be named
by full or relative path.</p>

<p>TARGET scope must name one existing target.</p>

<p>SOURCE scope must name one source file.</p>

<p>TEST scope must name one existing test.</p>

<p>VARIABLE scope is unique and does not accept a name.</p>

<p>The required PROPERTY option is immediately followed by
the name of the property to get. If the property is not set
an empty value is returned. If the SET option is given the
variable is set to a boolean value indicating whether the
property has been set. If the DEFINED option is given the
variable is set to a boolean value indicating whether the
property has been defined such as with define_property. If
BRIEF_DOCS or FULL_DOCS is given then the variable is set to
a string containing documenta- tion for the requested
property. If documentation is requested for a property that
has not been defined NOTFOUND is returned.</p>

<p>get_source_file_property Get a property for a source
file.</p>

<p>get_source_file_property(VAR file property)</p>

<p>Get a property from a source file. The value of the
property is stored in the variable VAR. If the property is
not found, VAR will be set to &quot;NOTFOUND&quot;. Use
set_source_files_properties to set property values. Source
file properties usually control how the file is built. One
property that is always there is LOCATION</p>

<p>get_target_property Get a property from a target.</p>

<p>get_target_property(VAR target property)</p>

<p>Get a property from a target. The value of the property
is stored in the variable VAR. If the property is not found,
VAR will be set to &quot;NOTFOUND&quot;. Use
set_target_properties to set property values. Properties are
usually used to control how a target is built, but some
query the target instead. This com- mand can get properties
for any target so far created. The tar- gets do not need to
be in the current CMakeLists.txt file.</p>

<p>get_test_property Get a property of the test.</p>

<p>get_test_property(test VAR property)</p>

<p>Get a property from the Test. The value of the property
is stored in the variable VAR. If the property is not found,
CMake will report an error. For a list of standard
properties you can type cmake --help-property-list</p>

<p>if Conditionally execute a group of commands.</p>

<p>if(expression) # then section. COMMAND1(ARGS ...)
COMMAND2(ARGS ...) ... elseif(expression2) # elseif section.
COMMAND1(ARGS ...) COMMAND2(ARGS ...) ... else(expression) #
else section. COMMAND1(ARGS ...) COMMAND2(ARGS ...) ...
endif(expression)</p>

<p>Evaluates the given expression. If the result is true,
the com- mands in the THEN section are invoked. Otherwise,
the commands in the else section are invoked. The elseif and
else sections are optional. You may have multiple elseif
clauses. Note that the same expression must be given to if,
and endif. Long expressions can be used and the order or
precedence is that the EXISTS, COMMAND, and DEFINED
operators will be evaluated first. Then any EQUAL, LESS,
GREATER, STRLESS, STRGREATER, STREQUAL, MATCHES will be
evaluated. Then NOT operators and finally AND, OR operators
will be evaluated. Possible expressions are:</p>

<p>if(variable)</p>

<p>True if the variables value is not empty, 0, N, NO, OFF,
FALSE, NOTFOUND, or &lt;variable&gt;-NOTFOUND.</p>

<p>if(NOT variable)</p>

<p>True if the variables value is empty, 0, N, NO, OFF,
FALSE, NOTFOUND, or &lt;variable&gt;-NOTFOUND.</p>

<p>if(variable1 AND variable2)</p>

<p>True if both variables would be considered true
individually.</p>

<p>if(variable1 OR variable2)</p>

<p>True if either variable would be considered true
individually.</p>

<p>if(COMMAND command-name)</p>

<p>True if the given name is a command, macro or function
that can be invoked.</p>

<p>if(POLICY policy-id)</p>

<p>True if the given name is an existing policy (of the
form CMP&lt;NNNN&gt;).</p>

<p>if(TARGET target-name)</p>

<p>True if the given name is an existing target, built or
imported.</p>

<p>if(EXISTS file-name) if(EXISTS directory-name)</p>

<p>True if the named file or directory exists. Behavior is
well-defined only for full paths.</p>

<p>if(file1 IS_NEWER_THAN file2)</p>

<p>True if file1 is newer than file2 or if one of the two
files doesn t exist. Behavior is well-defined only for full
paths.</p>

<p>if(IS_DIRECTORY directory-name)</p>

<p>True if the given name is a directory. Behavior is
well-defined only for full paths.</p>

<p>if(IS_ABSOLUTE path)</p>

<p>True if the given path is an absolute path.</p>

<p>if(variable MATCHES regex) if(string MATCHES regex)</p>

<p>True if the given string or variables value matches the
given regular expression.</p>

<p>if(variable LESS number) if(string LESS number)
if(variable GREATER number) if(string GREATER number)
if(variable EQUAL number) if(string EQUAL number)</p>

<p>True if the given string or variables value is a valid
number and the inequality or equality is true.</p>

<p>if(variable STRLESS string) if(string STRLESS string)
if(variable STRGREATER string) if(string STRGREATER string)
if(variable STREQUAL string) if(string STREQUAL string)</p>

<p>True if the given string or variables value is
lexicographi- cally less (or greater, or equal) than the
string on the right.</p>

<p>if(version1 VERSION_LESS version2) if(version1
VERSION_EQUAL version2) if(version1 VERSION_GREATER
version2)</p>

<p>Component-wise integer version number comparison
(version format is major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]]).</p>

<p>if(DEFINED variable)</p>

<p>True if the given variable is defined. It does not
matter if the variable is true or false just if it has been
set.</p>

<p>include Read CMake listfile code from the given
file.</p>

<p>include(&lt;file|module&gt; [OPTIONAL] [RESULT_VARIABLE
&lt;VAR&gt;] [NO_POLICY_SCOPE])</p>

<p>Reads CMake listfile code from the given file. Commands
in the file are processed immediately as if they were
written in place of the include command. If OPTIONAL is
present, then no error is raised if the file does not exist.
If RESULT_VARIABLE is given the variable will be set to the
full filename which has been included or NOTFOUND if it
failed.</p>

<p>If a module is specified instead of a file, the file
with name &lt;modulename&gt;.cmake is searched in the
CMAKE_MODULE_PATH.</p>

<p>See the cmake_policy() command documentation for
discussion of the NO_POLICY_SCOPE option.</p>

<p>include_directories Add include directories to the
build.</p>

<p>include_directories([AFTER|BEFORE] [SYSTEM] dir1 dir2
...)</p>

<p>Add the given directories to those searched by the
compiler for include files. By default the directories are
appended onto the current list of directories. This default
behavior can be changed by setting
CMAKE_include_directories_BEFORE to ON. By using BEFORE or
AFTER you can select between appending and prepending,
independent from the default. If the SYSTEM option is given
the compiler will be told that the directories are meant as
system include directories on some platforms.</p>

<p>include_external_msproject Include an external Microsoft
project file in a workspace.</p>

<p>include_external_msproject(projectname location dep1
dep2 ...)</p>

<p>Includes an external Microsoft project in the generated
workspace file. Currently does nothing on UNIX. This will
cre- ate a target named
INCLUDE_EXTERNAL_MSPROJECT_[projectname]. This can be used
in the add_dependencies command to make things depend on the
external project.</p>

<p>include_regular_expression Set the regular expression
used for dependency checking.</p>

<p>include_regular_expression(regex_match
[regex_complain])</p>

<p>Set the regular expressions used in dependency checking.
Only files matching regex_match will be traced as
dependencies. Only files matching regex_complain will
generate warnings if they cannot be found (standard header
paths are not searched). The defaults are:</p>

<p>regex_match = &quot;^.*$&quot; (match everything)
regex_complain = &quot;^$&quot; (match empty string
only)</p>

<p>install Specify rules to run at install time.</p>

<p>This command generates installation rules for a project.
Rules specified by calls to this command within a source
directory are executed in order during installation. The
order across direc- tories is not defined.</p>

<p>There are multiple signatures for this command. Some of
them define installation properties for files and targets.
Proper- ties common to multiple signatures are covered here
but they are valid only for signatures that specify
them.</p>

<p>DESTINATION arguments specify the directory on disk to
which a file will be installed. If a full path (with a
leading slash or drive letter) is given it is used directly.
If a relative path is given it is interpreted relative to
the value of CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.</p>

<p>PERMISSIONS arguments specify permissions for installed
files. Valid permissions are OWNER_READ, OWNER_WRITE,
OWNER_EXECUTE, GROUP_READ, GROUP_WRITE, GROUP_EXECUTE,
WORLD_READ, WORLD_WRITE, WORLD_EXECUTE, SETUID, and SETGID.
Permissions that do not make sense on certain platforms are
ignored on those platforms.</p>

<p>The CONFIGURATIONS argument specifies a list of build
configura- tions for which the install rule applies (Debug,
Release, etc.).</p>

<p>The COMPONENT argument specifies an installation
component name with which the install rule is associated,
such as &quot;runtime&quot; or &quot;development&quot;.
During component-specific installation only install rules
associated with the given component name will be executed.
During a full installation all components are installed.</p>

<p>The RENAME argument specifies a name for an installed
file that may be different from the original file. Renaming
is allowed only when a single file is installed by the
command.</p>

<p>The OPTIONAL argument specifies that it is not an error
if the file to be installed does not exist.</p>

<p>The TARGETS signature:</p>

<p>install(TARGETS targets... [EXPORT &lt;export-name&gt;]
[[ARCHIVE|LIBRARY|RUNTIME|FRAMEWORK|BUNDLE|
PRIVATE_HEADER|PUBLIC_HEADER|RESOURCE] [DESTINATION
&lt;dir&gt;] [PERMISSIONS permissions...] [CONFIGURATIONS
[Debug|Release|...]] [COMPONENT &lt;component&gt;]
[OPTIONAL] [NAMELINK_ONLY|NAMELINK_SKIP] ] [...])</p>

<p>The TARGETS form specifies rules for installing targets
from a project. There are five kinds of target files that
may be installed: ARCHIVE, LIBRARY, RUNTIME, FRAMEWORK, and
BUNDLE. Executables are treated as RUNTIME targets, except
that those marked with the MACOSX_BUNDLE property are
treated as BUNDLE targets on OS X. Static libraries are
always treated as ARCHIVE targets. Module libraries are
always treated as LIBRARY targets. For non-DLL platforms
shared libraries are treated as LIBRARY targets, except that
those marked with the FRAMEWORK property are treated as
FRAMEWORK targets on OS X. For DLL platforms the DLL part of
a shared library is treated as a RUNTIME target and the
corresponding import library is treated as an ARCHIVE tar-
get. All Windows-based systems including Cygwin are DLL
plat- forms. The ARCHIVE, LIBRARY, RUNTIME, and FRAMEWORK
arguments change the type of target to which the subsequent
properties apply. If none is given the installation
properties apply to all target types. If only one is given
then only targets of that type will be installed (which can
be used to install just a DLL or just an import
library).</p>

<p>The PRIVATE_HEADER, PUBLIC_HEADER, and RESOURCE
arguments cause subsequent properties to be applied to
installing a FRAMEWORK shared library target s associated
files on non-Apple platforms. Rules defined by these
arguments are ignored on Apple platforms because the
associated files are installed into the appropriate
locations inside the framework folder. See documentation of
the PRIVATE_HEADER, PUBLIC_HEADER, and RESOURCE target
properties for details.</p>

<p>Either NAMELINK_ONLY or NAMELINK_SKIP may be specified
as a LIBRARY option. On some platforms a versioned shared
library has a symbolic link such as</p>

<p>lib&lt;name&gt;.so -&gt; lib&lt;name&gt;.so.1</p>

<p>where &quot;lib&lt;name&gt;.so.1&quot; is the soname of
the library and &quot;lib&lt;name&gt;.so&quot; is a
&quot;namelink&quot; allowing linkers to find the library
when given &quot;-l&lt;name&gt;&quot;. The NAMELINK_ONLY
option causes installation of only the namelink when a
library target is installed. The NAMELINK_SKIP option causes
installation of library files other than the namelink when a
library target is installed. When neither option is given
both portions are installed. On platforms where versioned
shared libraries do not have namelinks or when a library is
not versioned the NAMELINK_SKIP option installs the library
and the NAMELINK_ONLY option installs nothing. See the
VERSION and SOVERSION target properties for details on
creating versioned shared libraries.</p>

<p>One or more groups of properties may be specified in a
single call to the TARGETS form of this command. A target
may be installed more than once to different locations.
Consider hypo- thetical targets &quot;myExe&quot;,
&quot;mySharedLib&quot;, and &quot;myStaticLib&quot;. The
code</p>

<p>install(TARGETS myExe mySharedLib myStaticLib RUNTIME
DESTINATION bin LIBRARY DESTINATION lib ARCHIVE DESTINATION
lib/static) install(TARGETS mySharedLib DESTINATION
/some/full/path)</p>

<p>will install myExe to &lt;prefix&gt;/bin and myStaticLib
to &lt;pre- fix&gt;/lib/static. On non-DLL platforms
mySharedLib will be installed to &lt;prefix&gt;/lib and
/some/full/path. On DLL platforms the mySharedLib DLL will
be installed to &lt;prefix&gt;/bin and /some/full/path and
its import library will be installed to
&lt;prefix&gt;/lib/static and /some/full/path. On non-DLL
platforms mySharedLib will be installed to
&lt;prefix&gt;/lib and /some/full/path.</p>

<p>The EXPORT option associates the installed target files
with an export called &lt;export-name&gt;. It must appear
before any RUNTIME, LIBRARY, or ARCHIVE options. See
documentation of the install(EXPORT ...) signature below for
details.</p>

<p>Installing a target with EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL set to true
has unde- fined behavior.</p>

<p>The FILES signature:</p>

<p>install(FILES files... DESTINATION &lt;dir&gt;
[PERMISSIONS permissions...] [CONFIGURATIONS
[Debug|Release|...]] [COMPONENT &lt;component&gt;] [RENAME
&lt;name&gt;] [OPTIONAL])</p>

<p>The FILES form specifies rules for installing files for
a project. File names given as relative paths are
interpreted with respect to the current source directory.
Files installed by this form are by default given
permissions OWNER_WRITE, OWNER_READ, GROUP_READ, and
WORLD_READ if no PERMISSIONS argu- ment is given.</p>

<p>The PROGRAMS signature:</p>

<p>install(PROGRAMS files... DESTINATION &lt;dir&gt;
[PERMISSIONS permissions...] [CONFIGURATIONS
[Debug|Release|...]] [COMPONENT &lt;component&gt;] [RENAME
&lt;name&gt;] [OPTIONAL])</p>

<p>The PROGRAMS form is identical to the FILES form except
that the default permissions for the installed file also
include OWNER_EXECUTE, GROUP_EXECUTE, and WORLD_EXECUTE.
This form is intended to install programs that are not
targets, such as shell scripts. Use the TARGETS form to
install targets built within the project.</p>

<p>The DIRECTORY signature:</p>

<p>install(DIRECTORY dirs... DESTINATION &lt;dir&gt;
[FILE_PERMISSIONS permissions...] [DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS
permissions...] [USE_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS] [CONFIGURATIONS
[Debug|Release|...]] [COMPONENT &lt;component&gt;]
[FILES_MATCHING] [[PATTERN &lt;pattern&gt; | REGEX
&lt;regex&gt;] [EXCLUDE] [PERMISSIONS permissions...]]
[...])</p>

<p>The DIRECTORY form installs contents of one or more
directories to a given destination. The directory structure
is copied ver- batim to the destination. The last component
of each directory name is appended to the destination
directory but a trailing slash may be used to avoid this
because it leaves the last com- ponent empty. Directory
names given as relative paths are interpreted with respect
to the current source directory. If no input directory names
are given the destination directory will be created but
nothing will be installed into it. The FILE_PER- MISSIONS
and DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS options specify permissions given
to files and directories in the destination. If
USE_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS is specified and FILE_PERMISSIONS is
not, file permissions will be copied from the source
directory structure. If no permissions are specified files
will be given the default permissions specified in the FILES
form of the com- mand, and the directories will be given the
default permissions specified in the PROGRAMS form of the
command.</p>

<p>Installation of directories may be controlled with fine
granu- larity using the PATTERN or REGEX options. These
&quot;match&quot; options specify a globbing pattern or
regular expression to match directories or files encountered
within input directories. They may be used to apply certain
options (see below) to a sub- set of the files and
directories encountered. The full path to each input file or
directory (with forward slashes) is matched against the
expression. A PATTERN will match only complete file names:
the portion of the full path matching the pattern must occur
at the end of the file name and be preceded by a slash. A
REGEX will match any portion of the full path but it may use
/ and $ to simulate the PATTERN behavior. By default all
files and directories are installed whether or not they are
matched. The FILES_MATCHING option may be given before the
first match option to disable installation of files (but not
directories) not matched by any expression. For example, the
code</p>

<p>install(DIRECTORY src/ DESTINATION include/myproj
FILES_MATCHING PATTERN &quot;*.h&quot;)</p>

<p>will extract and install header files from a source
tree.</p>

<p>Some options may follow a PATTERN or REGEX expression
and are applied only to files or directories matching them.
The EXCLUDE option will skip the matched file or directory.
The PERMISSIONS option overrides the permissions setting for
the matched file or directory. For example the code</p>

<p>install(DIRECTORY icons scripts/ DESTINATION
share/myproj PATTERN &quot;CVS&quot; EXCLUDE PATTERN
&quot;scripts/*&quot; PERMISSIONS OWNER_EXECUTE OWNER_WRITE
OWNER_READ GROUP_EXECUTE GROUP_READ)</p>

<p>will install the icons directory to share/myproj/icons
and the scripts directory to share/myproj. The icons will
get default file permissions, the scripts will be given
specific permis- sions, and any CVS directories will be
excluded.</p>

<p>The SCRIPT and CODE signature:</p>

<p>install([[SCRIPT &lt;file&gt;] [CODE &lt;code&gt;]]
[...])</p>

<p>The SCRIPT form will invoke the given CMake script files
during installation. If the script file name is a relative
path it will be interpreted with respect to the current
source direc- tory. The CODE form will invoke the given
CMake code during installation. Code is specified as a
single argument inside a double-quoted string. For example,
the code</p>

<p>install(CODE &quot;MESSAGE(</p>

<p>will print a message during installation.</p>

<p>The EXPORT signature:</p>

<p>install(EXPORT &lt;export-name&gt; DESTINATION
&lt;dir&gt; [NAMESPACE &lt;namespace&gt;] [FILE
&lt;name&gt;.cmake] [PERMISSIONS permissions...]
[CONFIGURATIONS [Debug|Release|...]] [COMPONENT
&lt;component&gt;])</p>

<p>The EXPORT form generates and installs a CMake file
containing code to import targets from the installation tree
into another project. Target installations are associated
with the export &lt;export-name&gt; using the EXPORT option
of the install(TARGETS ...) signature documented above. The
NAMESPACE option will prepend &lt;namespace&gt; to the
target names as they are written to the import file. By
default the generated file will be called
&lt;export-name&gt;.cmake but the FILE option may be used to
specify a different name. The value given to the FILE option
must be a file name with the &quot;.cmake&quot; extension.
If a CONFIGURATIONS option is given then the file will only
be installed when one of the named configurations is
installed. Additionally, the gener- ated import file will
reference only the matching target config- urations. If a
COMPONENT option is specified that does not match that given
to the targets associated with &lt;export-name&gt; the
behavior is undefined. If a library target is included in
the export but a target to which it links is not included
the behavior is unspecified.</p>

<p>The EXPORT form is useful to help outside projects use
targets built and installed by the current project. For
example, the code</p>

<p>install(TARGETS myexe EXPORT myproj DESTINATION bin)
install(EXPORT myproj NAMESPACE mp_ DESTINATION
lib/myproj)</p>

<p>will install the executable myexe to &lt;prefix&gt;/bin
and code to import it in the file
&quot;&lt;prefix&gt;/lib/myproj/myproj.cmake&quot;. An
outside project may load this file with the include command
and reference the myexe executable from the installation
tree using the imported target name mp_myexe as if the
target were built in its own tree.</p>

<p>NOTE: This command supercedes the INSTALL_TARGETS
command and the target properties PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT and
POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT. It also replaces the FILES forms of the
INSTALL_FILES and INSTALL_PROGRAMS commands. The processing
order of these install rules relative to those generated by
INSTALL_TARGETS, INSTALL_FILES, and INSTALL_PROGRAMS
commands is not defined.</p>

<p>link_directories Specify directories in which the linker
will look for libraries.</p>

<p>link_directories(directory1 directory2 ...)</p>

<p>Specify the paths in which the linker should search for
libraries. The command will apply only to targets created
after it is called. For historical reasons, relative paths
given to this command are passed to the linker unchanged
(unlike many CMake commands which interpret them relative to
the current source directory).</p>

<p>list List operations.</p>

<p>list(LENGTH &lt;list&gt; &lt;output variable&gt;)
list(GET &lt;list&gt; &lt;element index&gt; [&lt;element
index&gt; ...] &lt;output variable&gt;) list(APPEND
&lt;list&gt; &lt;element&gt; [&lt;element&gt; ...])
list(FIND &lt;list&gt; &lt;value&gt; &lt;output
variable&gt;) list(INSERT &lt;list&gt; &lt;element_index&gt;
&lt;element&gt; [&lt;element&gt; ...]) list(REMOVE_ITEM
&lt;list&gt; &lt;value&gt; [&lt;value&gt; ...])
list(REMOVE_AT &lt;list&gt; &lt;index&gt; [&lt;index&gt;
...]) list(REMOVE_DUPLICATES &lt;list&gt;) list(REVERSE
&lt;list&gt;) list(SORT &lt;list&gt;)</p>

<p>LENGTH will return a given lists length.</p>

<p>GET will return list of elements specified by indices
from the list.</p>

<p>APPEND will append elements to the list.</p>

<p>FIND will return the index of the element specified in
the list or -1 if it wasnt found.</p>

<p>INSERT will insert elements to the list to the specified
loca- tion.</p>

<p>REMOVE_AT and REMOVE_ITEM will remove items from the
list. The difference is that REMOVE_ITEM will remove the
given items, while REMOVE_AT will remove the items at the
given indices.</p>

<p>REMOVE_DUPLICATES will remove duplicated items in the
list.</p>

<p>REVERSE reverses the contents of the list in-place.</p>

<p>SORT sorts the list in-place alphabetically.</p>

<p>NOTES: A list in cmake is a ; separated group of
strings. To create a list the set command can be used. For
example, set(var a b c d e) creates a list with a;b;c;d;e,
and set(var &quot;a b c d e&quot;) creates a string or a
list with one item in it.</p>

<p>When specifying index values, if &lt;element index&gt;
is 0 or greater, it is indexed from the beginning of the
list, with 0 representing the first list element. If
&lt;element index&gt; is -1 or lesser, it is indexed from
the end of the list, with -1 repre- senting the last list
element. Be careful when counting with negative indices:
they do not start from 0. -0 is equivalent to 0, the first
list element.</p>

<p>load_cache Load in the values from another projects
CMake cache.</p>

<p>load_cache(pathToCacheFile READ_WITH_PREFIX prefix
entry1...)</p>

<p>Read the cache and store the requested entries in
variables with their name prefixed with the given prefix.
This only reads the values, and does not create entries in
the local projects cache.</p>

<p>load_cache(pathToCacheFile [EXCLUDE entry1...]
[INCLUDE_INTERNALS entry1...])</p>

<p>Load in the values from another cache and store them in
the local projects cache as internal entries. This is useful
for a project that depends on another project built in a
different tree. EXCLUDE option can be used to provide a list
of entries to be excluded. INCLUDE_INTERNALS can be used to
provide a list of internal entries to be included. Normally,
no internal entries are brought in. Use of this form of the
command is strongly discouraged, but it is provided for
backward compati- bility.</p>

<p>load_command Load a command into a running CMake.</p>

<p>load_command(COMMAND_NAME &lt;loc1&gt; [loc2 ...])</p>

<p>The given locations are searched for a library whose
name is cmCOMMAND_NAME. If found, it is loaded as a module
and the com- mand is added to the set of available CMake
commands. Usually, TRY_COMPILE is used before this command
to compile the module. If the command is successfully loaded
a variable named</p>

<p>CMAKE_LOADED_COMMAND_&lt;COMMAND_NAME&gt;</p>

<p>will be set to the full path of the module that was
loaded. Otherwise the variable will not be set.</p>

<p>macro Start recording a macro for later invocation as a
command.</p>

<p>macro(&lt;name&gt; [arg1 [arg2 [arg3 ...]]])
COMMAND1(ARGS ...) COMMAND2(ARGS ...) ...
endmacro(&lt;name&gt;)</p>

<p>Define a macro named &lt;name&gt; that takes arguments
named arg1 arg2 arg3 (...). Commands listed after macro, but
before the match- ing endmacro, are not invoked until the
macro is invoked. When it is invoked, the commands recorded
in the macro are first mod- ified by replacing formal
parameters (${arg1}) with the argu- ments passed, and then
invoked as normal commands. In addition to referencing the
formal parameters you can reference the val- ues ${ARGC}
which will be set to the number of arguments passed into the
function as well as ${ARGV0} ${ARGV1} ${ARGV2} ... which
will have the actual values of the arguments passed in. This
facilitates creating macros with optional arguments. Addi-
tionally ${ARGV} holds the list of all arguments given to
the macro and ${ARGN} holds the list of argument pass the
last expected argument. Note that the parameters to a macro
and val- ues such as ARGN are not variables in the usual
CMake sense. They are string replacements much like the c
preprocessor would do with a macro. If you want true CMake
variables you should look at the function command.</p>

<p>See the cmake_policy() command documentation for the
behavior of policies inside macros.</p>

<p>mark_as_advanced Mark cmake cached variables as
advanced.</p>

<p>mark_as_advanced([CLEAR|FORCE] VAR VAR2 VAR...)</p>

<p>Mark the named cached variables as advanced. An advanced
vari- able will not be displayed in any of the cmake GUIs
unless the show advanced option is on. If CLEAR is the first
argument advanced variables are changed back to unadvanced.
If FORCE is the first argument, then the variable is made
advanced. If nei- ther FORCE nor CLEAR is specified, new
values will be marked as advanced, but if the variable
already has an advanced/non-advanced state, it will not be
changed.</p>

<p>It does nothing in script mode.</p>

<p>math Mathematical expressions.</p>

<p>math(EXPR &lt;output variable&gt; &lt;math
expression&gt;)</p>

<p>EXPR evaluates mathematical expression and return result
in the output variable. Example mathematical expression is 5
* ( 10 + 13 ). Supported operators are + - * / % | &amp; ^ ~
&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt; * / %. They have the same meaning as they
do in c code.</p>

<p>message Display a message to the user.</p>

<p>message([SEND_ERROR | STATUS | FATAL_ERROR]
&quot;message to display&quot; ...)</p>

<p>By default the message is displayed in a pop up window
(CMake- Setup), or in the stdout of cmake, or the error
section of ccmake. If the first argument is SEND_ERROR then
an error is raised, and the generate phase will be skipped.
If the first argument is FATAL_ERROR, all processing is
halted. If the first argument is STATUS then the message is
displayed in the progress line for the GUI, or with a -- in
the command line cmake.</p>

<p>option Provides an option that the user can optionally
select.</p>

<p>option(&lt;option_variable&gt; &quot;help string
describing option&quot; [initial value])</p>

<p>Provide an option for the user to select as ON or OFF.
If no initial value is provided, OFF is used.</p>

<p>output_required_files Output a list of required source
files for a specified source file.</p>

<p>output_required_files(srcfile outputfile)</p>

<p>Outputs a list of all the source files that are required
by the specified srcfile. This list is written into
outputfile. This is similar to writing out the dependencies
for srcfile except that it jumps from .h files into .cxx, .c
and .cpp files if possible.</p>

<p>project Set a name for the entire project.</p>

<p>project(&lt;projectname&gt; [languageName1 languageName2
... ] )</p>

<p>Sets the name of the project. Additionally this sets the
vari- ables &lt;projectName&gt;_BINARY_DIR and
&lt;projectName&gt;_SOURCE_DIR to the respective values.</p>

<p>Optionally you can specify which languages your project
sup- ports. Example languages are CXX (i.e. C++), C,
Fortran, etc. By default C and CXX are enabled. E.g. if you
do not have a C++ compiler, you can disable the check for it
by explicitely list- ing the languages you want to support,
e.g. C. By using the special language &quot;NONE&quot; all
checks for any language can be dis- abled.</p>

<p>qt_wrap_cpp Create Qt Wrappers.</p>

<p>qt_wrap_cpp(resultingLibraryName DestName SourceLists
...)</p>

<p>Produce moc files for all the .h files listed in the
SourceLists. The moc files will be added to the library
using the DestName source list.</p>

<p>qt_wrap_ui Create Qt user interfaces Wrappers.</p>

<p>qt_wrap_ui(resultingLibraryName HeadersDestName
SourcesDestName SourceLists ...)</p>

<p>Produce .h and .cxx files for all the .ui files listed
in the SourceLists. The .h files will be added to the
library using the HeadersDestNamesource list. The .cxx files
will be added to the library using the SourcesDestNamesource
list.</p>

<p>remove_definitions Removes -D define flags added by
add_definitions.</p>

<p>remove_definitions(-DFOO -DBAR ...)</p>

<p>Removes flags (added by add_definitions) from the
compiler com- mand line for sources in the current directory
and below.</p>

<p>return Return from a file, directory or function.</p>

<p>return()</p>

<p>Returns from a file, directory or function. When this
command is encountered in an included file (via include() or
find_pack- age()), it causes processing of the current file
to stop and control is returned to the including file. If it
is encountered in a file which is not included by another
file, e.g. a CMake- Lists.txt, control is returned to the
parent directory if there is one. If return is called in a
function, control is returned to the caller of the function.
Note that a macro is not a func- tion and does not handle
return like a function does.</p>

<p>separate_arguments Split space separated arguments into
a semi-colon separated list.</p>

<p>separate_arguments(VARIABLE)</p>

<p>Convert the value of VARIABLE to a semi-colon separated
list. All spaces are replaced with ;. This helps with
generating command lines.</p>

<p>set Set a CMAKE variable to a given value.</p>

<p>set(&lt;variable&gt; &lt;value&gt; [[CACHE &lt;type&gt;
&lt;docstring&gt; [FORCE]] | PARENT_SCOPE])</p>

<p>Within CMake sets &lt;variable&gt; to the value
&lt;value&gt;. &lt;value&gt; is expanded before
&lt;variable&gt; is set to it. If CACHE is present, then the
&lt;variable&gt; is put in the cache. &lt;type&gt; and
&lt;docstring&gt; are then required. &lt;type&gt; is used by
the CMake GUI to choose a widget with which the user sets a
value. The value for &lt;type&gt; may be one of</p>

<p>FILEPATH = File chooser dialog. PATH = Directory chooser
dialog. STRING = Arbitrary string. BOOL = Boolean ON/OFF
checkbox. INTERNAL = No GUI entry (used for persistent
variables).</p>

<p>If &lt;type&gt; is INTERNAL, then the &lt;value&gt; is
always written into the cache, replacing any values existing
in the cache. If it is not a cache variable, then this
always writes into the current makefile. The FORCE option
will overwrite the cache value remov- ing any changes by the
user.</p>

<p>If PARENT_SCOPE is present, the variable will be set in
the scope above the current scope. Each new directory or
function creates a new scope. This command will set the
value of a vari- able into the parent directory or calling
function (whichever is applicable to the case at hand) If
VALUE is not specified then the variable is removed from the
parent scope.</p>

<p>set(&lt;variable&gt; &lt;value1&gt; ...
&lt;valueN&gt;)</p>

<p>In this case &lt;variable&gt; is set to a semicolon
separated list of values.</p>

<p>&lt;variable&gt; can be an environment variable such
as:</p>

<p>set( ENV{PATH} /home/martink )</p>

<p>in which case the environment variable will be set.</p>

<p>set_directory_properties Set a property of the
directory.</p>

<p>set_directory_properties(PROPERTIES prop1 value1 prop2
value2)</p>

<p>Set a property for the current directory and
subdirectories. If the property is not found, CMake will
report an error. The prop- erties include:
INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES, LINK_DIRECTORIES,
INCLUDE_REGULAR_EXPRESSION, and
ADDITIONAL_MAKE_CLEAN_FILES.</p>

<p>ADDITIONAL_MAKE_CLEAN_FILES is a list of files that will
be cleaned as a part of &quot;make clean&quot; stage.</p>

<p>set_property Set a named property in a given scope.</p>

<p>set_property(&lt;GLOBAL | DIRECTORY [dir] | TARGET
[target1 [target2 ...]] | SOURCE [src1 [src2 ...]] | TEST
[test1 [test2 ...]]&gt; [APPEND] PROPERTY &lt;name&gt;
[value1 [value2 ...]])</p>

<p>Set one property on zero or more objects of a scope. The
first argument determines the scope in which the property is
set. It must be one of the following:</p>

<p>GLOBAL scope is unique and does not accept a name.</p>

<p>DIRECTORY scope defaults to the current directory but
another directory (already processed by CMake) may be named
by full or relative path.</p>

<p>TARGET scope may name zero or more existing targets.</p>

<p>SOURCE scope may name zero or more source files.</p>

<p>TEST scope may name zero or more existing tests.</p>

<p>The required PROPERTY option is immediately followed by
the name of the property to set. Remaining arguments are
used to compose the property value in the form of a
semicolon-separated list. If the APPEND option is given the
list is appended to any exist- ing property value.</p>

<p>set_source_files_properties Source files can have
properties that affect how they are built.</p>

<p>set_source_files_properties(file1 file2 ... PROPERTIES
prop1 value1 prop2 value2 ...)</p>

<p>Set properties on a file. The syntax for the command is
to list all the files you want to change, and then provide
the values you want to set next. You can make up your own
properties as well. The following are used by CMake. The
ABSTRACT flag (boolean) is used by some class wrapping
commands. If WRAP_EXCLUDE (boolean) is true then many
wrapping commands will ignore this file. If GENERATED
(boolean) is true then it is not an error if this source
file does not exist when it is added to a target. Obviously,
it must be created (presumably by a custom command) before
the target is built. If the HEADER_FILE_ONLY (boolean)
property is true then the file is not compiled. This is
useful if you want to add extra non build files to an IDE.
OBJECT_DEPENDS (string) adds dependencies to the object
file. COMPILE_FLAGS (string) is passed to the compiler as
additional command line arguments when the source file is
compiled. LAN- GUAGE (string) CXX|C will change the default
compiler used to compile the source file. The languages used
need to be enabled in the PROJECT command. If SYMBOLIC
(boolean) is set to true the build system will be informed
that the source file is not actu- ally created on disk but
instead used as a symbolic name for a build rule.</p>

<p>set_target_properties Targets can have properties that
affect how they are built.</p>

<p>set_target_properties(target1 target2 ... PROPERTIES
prop1 value1 prop2 value2 ...)</p>

<p>Set properties on a target. The syntax for the command
is to list all the files you want to change, and then
provide the val- ues you want to set next. You can use any
prop value pair you want and extract it later with the
GET_TARGET_PROPERTY command.</p>

<p>Properties that affect the name of a targets output file
are as follows. The PREFIX and SUFFIX properties override
the default target name prefix (such as &quot;lib&quot;) and
suffix (such as &quot;.so&quot;). IMPORT_PREFIX and
IMPORT_SUFFIX are the equivalent properties for the import
library corresponding to a DLL (for SHARED library targets).
OUTPUT_NAME sets the real name of a target when it is built
and can be used to help create two targets of the same name
even though CMake requires unique logical target names.
There is also a &lt;CONFIG&gt;_OUTPUT_NAME that can set the
output name on a per-configuration basis.
&lt;CONFIG&gt;_POSTFIX sets a postfix for the real name of
the target when it is built under the configuration named by
&lt;CONFIG&gt; (in upper-case, such as
&quot;DEBUG_POSTFIX&quot;). The value of this property is
initialized when the target is created to the value of the
variable CMAKE_&lt;CONFIG&gt;_POSTFIX (except for executable
targets because earlier CMake versions which did not use
this variable for exe- cutables).</p>

<p>The LINK_FLAGS property can be used to add extra flags
to the link step of a target. LINK_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt; will
add to the con- figuration &lt;CONFIG&gt;, for example,
DEBUG, RELEASE, MINSIZEREL, RELWITHDEBINFO. DEFINE_SYMBOL
sets the name of the preprocessor symbol defined when
compiling sources in a shared library. If not set here then
it is set to target_EXPORTS by default (with some
substitutions if the target is not a valid C identifier).
This is useful for headers to know whether they are being
included from inside their library our outside to properly
setup dllexport/dllimport decorations. The COMPILE_FLAGS
property sets additional compiler flags used to build
sources within the tar- get. It may also be used to pass
additional preprocessor defi- nitions.</p>

<p>The LINKER_LANGUAGE property is used to change the tool
used to link an executable or shared library. The default is
set the language to match the files in the library. CXX and
C are common values for this property.</p>

<p>For shared libraries VERSION and SOVERSION can be used
to spec- ify the build version and api version respectively.
When build- ing or installing appropriate symlinks are
created if the plat- form supports symlinks and the linker
supports so-names. If only one of both is specified the
missing is assumed to have the same version number. For
executables VERSION can be used to specify the build
version. When building or installing appropriate sym- links
are created if the platform supports symlinks. For shared
libraries and executables on Windows the VERSION attribute
is parsed to extract a &quot;major.minor&quot; version
number. These numbers are used as the image version of the
binary.</p>

<p>There are a few properties used to specify RPATH rules.
INSTALL_RPATH is a semicolon-separated list specifying the
rpath to use in installed targets (for platforms that
support it). INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH is a boolean that
if set to true will append directories in the linker search
path and outside the project to the INSTALL_RPATH.
SKIP_BUILD_RPATH is a boolean specifying whether to skip
automatic generation of an rpath allowing the target to run
from the build tree. BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH is a boolean
specifying whether to link the target in the build tree with
the INSTALL_RPATH. This takes precedence over
SKIP_BUILD_RPATH and avoids the need for relink- ing before
installation. INSTALL_NAME_DIR is a string specify- ing the
directory portion of the &quot;install_name&quot; field of
shared libraries on Mac OSX to use in the installed targets.
When the target is created the values of the variables
CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH, CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH,
CMAKE_SKIP_BUILD_RPATH, CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH, and
CMAKE_INSTALL_NAME_DIR are used to initialize these
properties.</p>

<p>PROJECT_LABEL can be used to change the name of the
target in an IDE like visual studio. VS_KEYWORD can be set
to change the visual studio keyword, for example QT
integration works better if this is set to Qt4VSv1.0.</p>

<p>VS_SCC_PROJECTNAME, VS_SCC_LOCALPATH, VS_SCC_PROVIDER
can be set to add support for source control bindings in a
Visual Studio project file.</p>

<p>When a library is built CMake by default generates code
to remove any existing library using all possible names.
This is needed to support libraries that switch between
STATIC and SHARED by a user option. However when using
OUTPUT_NAME to build a static and shared library of the same
name using differ- ent logical target names the two targets
will remove each others files. This can be prevented by
setting the CLEAN_DIRECT_OUTPUT property to 1.</p>

<p>The PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT and POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT
properties are the old way to specify CMake scripts to run
before and after installing a target. They are used only
when the old INSTALL_TARGETS command is used to install the
target. Use the INSTALL command instead.</p>

<p>The EXCLUDE_FROM_DEFAULT_BUILD property is used by the
visual studio generators. If it is set to 1 the target will
not be part of the default build when you select &quot;Build
Solution&quot;.</p>

<p>set_tests_properties Set a property of the tests.</p>

<p>set_tests_properties(test1 [test2...] PROPERTIES prop1
value1 prop2 value2)</p>

<p>Set a property for the tests. If the property is not
found, CMake will report an error. The properties
include:</p>

<p>WILL_FAIL: If set to true, this will invert the
pass/fail flag of the test.</p>

<p>PASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION: If set, the test output will be
checked against the specified regular expressions and at
least one of the regular expressions has to match, otherwise
the test will fail.</p>

<p>Example: PASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION &quot;TestPassed;All
ok&quot;</p>

<p>FAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION: If set, if the output will
match to one of specified regular expressions, the test will
fail.</p>

<p>Example: PASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION
&quot;[^a-z]Error;ERROR;Failed&quot;</p>

<p>Both PASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION and FAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION
expect a list of regular expressions.</p>

<p>site_name Set the given variable to the name of the
computer.</p>

<p>site_name(variable)</p>

<p>source_group Define a grouping for sources in the
makefile.</p>

<p>source_group(name [REGULAR_EXPRESSION regex] [FILES src1
src2 ...])</p>

<p>Defines a group into which sources will be placed in
project files. This is mainly used to setup file tabs in
Visual Studio. Any file whose name is listed or matches the
regular expression will be placed in this group. If a file
matches multiple groups, the LAST group that explicitly
lists the file will be favored, if any. If no group
explicitly lists the file, the LAST group whose regular
expression matches the file will be favored.</p>

<p>The name of the group may contain backslashes to specify
sub- groups:</p>

<p>source_group(outer\inner ...)</p>

<p>For backwards compatibility, this command is also
supports the format:</p>

<p>source_group(name regex)</p>

<p>string String operations.</p>

<p>string(REGEX MATCH &lt;regular_expression&gt; &lt;output
variable&gt; &lt;input&gt; [&lt;input&gt;...]) string(REGEX
MATCHALL &lt;regular_expression&gt; &lt;output variable&gt;
&lt;input&gt; [&lt;input&gt;...]) string(REGEX REPLACE
&lt;regular_expression&gt; &lt;replace_expression&gt;
&lt;output variable&gt; &lt;input&gt; [&lt;input&gt;...])
string(REPLACE &lt;match_string&gt; &lt;replace_string&gt;
&lt;output variable&gt; &lt;input&gt; [&lt;input&gt;...])
string(COMPARE EQUAL &lt;string1&gt; &lt;string2&gt;
&lt;output variable&gt;) string(COMPARE NOTEQUAL
&lt;string1&gt; &lt;string2&gt; &lt;output variable&gt;)
string(COMPARE LESS &lt;string1&gt; &lt;string2&gt;
&lt;output variable&gt;) string(COMPARE GREATER
&lt;string1&gt; &lt;string2&gt; &lt;output variable&gt;)
string(ASCII &lt;number&gt; [&lt;number&gt; ...] &lt;output
variable&gt;) string(CONFIGURE &lt;string1&gt; &lt;output
variable&gt; [@ONLY] [ESCAPE_QUOTES]) string(TOUPPER
&lt;string1&gt; &lt;output variable&gt;) string(TOLOWER
&lt;string1&gt; &lt;output variable&gt;) string(LENGTH
&lt;string&gt; &lt;output variable&gt;) string(SUBSTRING
&lt;string&gt; &lt;begin&gt; &lt;length&gt; &lt;output
variable&gt;) string(STRIP &lt;string&gt; &lt;output
variable&gt;) string(RANDOM [LENGTH &lt;length&gt;]
[ALPHABET &lt;alphabet&gt;] &lt;output variable&gt;)</p>

<p>REGEX MATCH will match the regular expression once and
store the match in the output variable.</p>

<p>REGEX MATCHALL will match the regular expression as many
times as possible and store the matches in the output
variable as a list.</p>

<p>REGEX REPLACE will match the regular expression as many
times as possible and substitute the replacement expression
for the match in the output. The replace expression may
refer to paren-delim- ited subexpressions of the match using
1, 2, ..., 9. Note that two backslashes (\1) are required in
CMake code to get a backslash through argument parsing.</p>

<p>REPLACE will replace all occurrences of match_string in
the input with replace_string and store the result in the
output.</p>

<p>COMPARE EQUAL/NOTEQUAL/LESS/GREATER will compare the
strings and store true or false in the output variable.</p>

<p>ASCII will convert all numbers into corresponding ASCII
charac- ters.</p>

<p>CONFIGURE will transform a string like CONFIGURE_FILE
transforms a file.</p>

<p>TOUPPER/TOLOWER will convert string to upper/lower
characters.</p>

<p>LENGTH will return a given strings length.</p>

<p>SUBSTRING will return a substring of a given string.</p>

<p>STRIP will return a substring of a given string with
leading and trailing spaces removed.</p>

<p>RANDOM will return a random string of given length
consisting of characters from the given alphabet. Default
length is 5 charac- ters and default alphabet is all numbers
and upper and lower case letters.</p>

<p>The following characters have special meaning in regular
expres- sions:</p>

<p>^ Matches at beginning of a line $ Matches at end of a
line . Matches any single character [ ] Matches any
character(s) inside the brackets [^ ] Matches any
character(s) not inside the brackets - Matches any character
in range on either side of a dash * Matches preceding
pattern zero or more times + Matches preceding pattern one
or more times ? Matches preceding pattern zero or once only
| Matches a pattern on either side of the | () Saves a
matched subexpression, which can be referenced in the REGEX
REPLACE operation. Additionally it is saved by all regular
expression-related commands, including e.g. if( MATCHES ),
in the variables CMAKE_MATCH_(0..9).</p>

<p>target_link_libraries Link a target to given
libraries.</p>

<p>target_link_libraries(&lt;target&gt; [lib1 [lib2 [...]]]
[[debug|optimized|general] &lt;lib&gt;] ...)</p>

<p>Specify a list of libraries to be linked into the
specified tar- get. If any library name matches that of a
target in the cur- rent project a dependency will
automatically be added in the build system to make sure the
library being linked is up-to-date before the target
links.</p>

<p>A &quot;debug&quot;, &quot;optimized&quot;, or
&quot;general&quot; keyword indicates that the library
immediately following it is to be used only for the cor-
responding build configuration. The &quot;debug&quot;
keyword corresponds to the Debug configuration (or to
configurations named in the DEBUG_CONFIGURATIONS global
property if it is set). The &quot;opti- mized&quot; keyword
corresponds to all other configurations. The
&quot;general&quot; keyword corresponds to all
configurations, and is purely optional (assumed if omitted).
Higher granularity may be achieved for per-configuration
rules by creating and linking to IMPORTED library targets.
See the IMPORTED mode of the add_library command for more
information.</p>

<p>Library dependencies are transitive by default. When
this tar- get is linked into another target then the
libraries linked to this target will appear on the link line
for the other target too. See the LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES
target property to over- ride the set of transitive link
dependencies for a target.</p>

<p>target_link_libraries(&lt;target&gt;
LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES [[debug|optimized|general]
&lt;lib&gt;] ...)</p>

<p>The LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES mode appends the libraries
to the LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES and its per-configuration
equivalent target properties instead of using them for
linking. Libraries specified as &quot;debug&quot; are
appended to the the LINK_INTER- FACE_LIBRARIES_DEBUG
property (or to the properties correspond- ing to
configurations listed in the DEBUG_CONFIGURATIONS global
property if it is set). Libraries specified as
&quot;optimized&quot; are appended to the the
LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES property. Libraries specified as
&quot;general&quot; (or without any keyword) are treated as
if specified for both &quot;debug&quot; and
&quot;optimized&quot;.</p>

<p>try_compile Try compiling some code.</p>

<p>try_compile(RESULT_VAR bindir srcdir projectName
&lt;targetname&gt; [CMAKE_FLAGS &lt;Flags&gt;]
[OUTPUT_VARIABLE var])</p>

<p>Try compiling a program. In this form, srcdir should
contain a complete CMake project with a CMakeLists.txt file
and all sources. The bindir and srcdir will not be deleted
after this command is run. If &lt;target name&gt; is
specified then build just that target otherwise the all or
ALL_BUILD target is built.</p>

<p>try_compile(RESULT_VAR bindir srcfile [CMAKE_FLAGS
&lt;Flags&gt;] [COMPILE_DEFINITIONS &lt;flags&gt; ...]
[OUTPUT_VARIABLE var] [COPY_FILE &lt;filename&gt; )</p>

<p>Try compiling a srcfile. In this case, the user need
only sup- ply a source file. CMake will create the
appropriate CMake- Lists.txt file to build the source. If
COPY_FILE is used, the compiled file will be copied to the
given file.</p>

<p>In this version all files in bindir/CMakeFiles/CMakeTmp,
will be cleaned automatically, for debugging a
--debug-trycompile can be passed to cmake to avoid the
clean. Some extra flags that can be included are,
INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES, LINK_DIRECTORIES, and LINK_LIBRARIES.
COMPILE_DEFINITIONS are -Ddefinition that will be passed to
the compile line. try_compile creates a CMake- List.txt file
on the fly that looks like this:</p>

<p>add_definitions( &lt;expanded COMPILE_DEFINITIONS from
calling cmake&gt;)
include_directories(${INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES})
link_directories(${LINK_DIRECTORIES})
add_executable(cmTryCompileExec sources)
target_link_libraries(cmTryCompileExec
${LINK_LIBRARIES})</p>

<p>In both versions of the command, if OUTPUT_VARIABLE is
speci- fied, then the output from the build process is
stored in the given variable. Return the success or failure
in RESULT_VAR. CMAKE_FLAGS can be used to pass
-DVAR:TYPE=VALUE flags to the cmake that is run during the
build.</p>

<p>try_run Try compiling and then running some code.</p>

<p>try_run(RUN_RESULT_VAR COMPILE_RESULT_VAR bindir srcfile
[CMAKE_FLAGS &lt;Flags&gt;] [COMPILE_DEFINITIONS
&lt;flags&gt;] [COMPILE_OUTPUT_VARIABLE comp]
[RUN_OUTPUT_VARIABLE run] [OUTPUT_VARIABLE var] [ARGS
&lt;arg1&gt; &lt;arg2&gt;...])</p>

<p>Try compiling a srcfile. Return TRUE or FALSE for
success or failure in COMPILE_RESULT_VAR. Then if the
compile succeeded, run the executable and return its exit
code in RUN_RESULT_VAR. If the executable was built, but
failed to run, then RUN_RESULT_VAR will be set to
FAILED_TO_RUN. COMPILE_OUT- PUT_VARIABLE specifies the
variable where the output from the compile step goes.
RUN_OUTPUT_VARIABLE specifies the variable where the output
from the running executable goes.</p>

<p>For compatibility reasons OUTPUT_VARIABLE is still
supported, which gives you the output from the compile and
run step com- bined.</p>

<p>Cross compiling issues</p>

<p>When cross compiling, the executable compiled in the
first step usually cannot be run on the build host.
try_run() checks the CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING variable to detect
whether CMake is in crosscompiling mode. If thats the case,
it will still try to compile the executable, but it will not
try to run the exe- cutable. Instead it will create cache
variables which must be filled by the user or by presetting
them in some CMake script file to the values the executable
would have produced if it would have been run on its actual
target platform. These vari- ables are RUN_RESULT_VAR
(explanation see above) and if RUN_OUT- PUT_VARIABLE (or
OUTPUT_VARIABLE) was used, an additional cache variable
RUN_RESULT_VAR__COMPILE_RESULT_VAR__TRYRUN_OUTPUT.This is
intended to hold stdout and stderr from the executable.</p>

<p>In order to make cross compiling your project easier,
use try_run only if really required. If you use try_run, use
RUN_OUTPUT_VARIABLE (or OUTPUT_VARIABLE) only if really
required. Using them will require that when crosscompiling,
the cache variables will have to be set manually to the
output of the executable. You can also &quot;guard&quot; the
calls to try_run with if(CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING) and provide
an easy-to-preset alterna- tive for this case.</p>

<p>unset Unset a variable, cache variable, or environment
variable.</p>

<p>unset(&lt;variable&gt; [CACHE])</p>

<p>Removes the specified variable causing it to become
undefined. If CACHE is present then the variable is removed
from the cache instead of the current scope.</p>

<p>&lt;variable&gt; can be an environment variable such
as:</p>

<p>unset(ENV{LD_LIBRARY_PATH})</p>

<p>in which case the variable will be removed from the
current environment.</p>

<p>variable_watch Watch the CMake variable for change.</p>

<p>variable_watch(&lt;variable name&gt; [&lt;command to
execute&gt;])</p>

<p>If the specified variable changes, the message will be
printed about the variable being changed. If the command is
specified, the command will be executed. The command will
receive the fol- lowing arguments: COMMAND(&lt;variable&gt;
&lt;access&gt; &lt;value&gt; &lt;current list file&gt;
&lt;stack&gt;)</p>

<p>while Evaluate a group of commands while a condition is
true</p>

<p>while(condition) COMMAND1(ARGS ...) COMMAND2(ARGS ...)
... endwhile(condition)</p>

<p>All commands between while and the matching endwhile are
recorded without being invoked. Once the endwhile is
evaluated, the recorded list of commands is invoked as long
as the condi- tion is true. The condition is evaluated using
the same logic as the if command.</p>

<p>PROPERTIES CMake Properties - Properties supported by
CMake, the Cross-Platform Makefile Generator.</p>

<p>This is the documentation for the properties supported
by CMake. Prop- erties can have different scopes. They can
either be assigned to a source file, a directory, a target
or globally to CMake. By modifying the values of properties
the behaviour of the build system can be cus- tomized.</p>

<p>PROPERTIES OF GLOBAL SCOPE
ALLOW_DUPLICATE_CUSTOM_TARGETS Allow duplicate custom
targets to be created.</p>

<p>Normally CMake requires that all targets built in a
project have globally unique logical names (see policy
CMP0002). This is necessary to generate meaningful project
file names in Xcode and VS IDE generators. It also allows
the target names to be refer- enced unambiguously.</p>

<p>Makefile generators are capable of supporting duplicate
custom target names. For projects that care only about
Makefile gener- ators and do not wish to support Xcode or VS
IDE generators, one may set this property to true to allow
duplicate custom targets. The property allows multiple
add_custom_target command calls in different directories to
specify the same target name. However, setting this property
will cause non-Makefile generators to pro- duce an error and
refuse to generate the project.</p>

<p>DEBUG_CONFIGURATIONS Specify which configurations are
for debugging.</p>

<p>The value must be a semi-colon separated list of
configuration names. Currently this property is used only by
the tar- get_link_libraries command (see its documentation
for details). Additional uses may be defined in the
future.</p>

<p>This property must be set at the top level of the
project and before the first target_link_libraries command
invocation. If any entry in the list does not match a valid
configuration for the project the behavior is undefined.</p>

<p>DISABLED_FEATURES List of features which are disabled
during the CMake run.</p>

<p>List of features which are disabled during the CMake
run. Be default it contains the names of all packages which
were not found. This is determined using the
&lt;NAME&gt;_FOUND variables. Packages which are searched
QUIET are not listed. A project can add its own features to
this list.This property is used by the macros in
FeatureSummary.cmake.</p>

<p>ENABLED_FEATURES List of features which are enabled
during the CMake run.</p>

<p>List of features which are enabled during the CMake run.
Be default it contains the names of all packages which were
found. This is determined using the &lt;NAME&gt;_FOUND
variables. Packages which are searched QUIET are not listed.
A project can add its own features to this list.This
property is used by the macros in FeatureSummary.cmake.</p>

<p>ENABLED_LANGUAGES Read-only property that contains the
list of currently enabled languages</p>

<p>Set to list of currently enabled lanauges.</p>

<p>FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIB64_PATHS Whether FIND_LIBRARY should
automatically search lib64 directo- ries.</p>

<p>FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIB64_PATHS is a boolean specifying
whether the FIND_LIBRARY command should automatically search
the lib64 vari- ant of directories called lib in the search
path when building 64-bit binaries.</p>

<p>GLOBAL_DEPENDS_DEBUG_MODE Enable global target
dependency graph debug mode.</p>

<p>CMake automatically analyzes the global inter-target
dependency graph at the beginning of native build system
generation. This property causes it to display details of
its analysis to stderr.</p>

<p>IN_TRY_COMPILE Read-only property that is true during a
try-compile configura- tion.</p>

<p>True when building a project inside a TRY_COMPILE or
TRY_RUN command.</p>

<p>PACKAGES_FOUND List of packages which were found during
the CMake run.</p>

<p>List of packages which were found during the CMake run.
Whether a package has been found is determined using the
&lt;NAME&gt;_FOUND variables.</p>

<p>PACKAGES_NOT_FOUND List of packages which were not found
during the CMake run.</p>

<p>List of packages which were not found during the CMake
run. Whether a package has been found is determined using
the &lt;NAME&gt;_FOUND variables.</p>

<p>REPORT_UNDEFINED_PROPERTIES If set, report any undefined
properties to this file.</p>

<p>If this property is set to a filename then when CMake
runs it will report any properties or variables that were
accessed but not defined into the filename specified in this
property.</p>

<p>TARGET_ARCHIVES_MAY_BE_SHARED_LIBS Set if shared
libraries may be named like archives.</p>

<p>On AIX shared libraries may be named
&quot;lib&lt;name&gt;.a&quot;. This prop- erty is set to
true on such platforms.</p>

<p>TARGET_SUPPORTS_SHARED_LIBS Does the target platform
support shared libraries.</p>

<p>TARGET_SUPPORTS_SHARED_LIBS is a boolean specifying
whether the target platform supports shared libraries.
Basically all current general general purpose OS do so, the
exception are usually embedded systems with no or special
OSs.</p>

<p>__CMAKE_DELETE_CACHE_CHANGE_VARS_ Internal property</p>

<p>Used to detect compiler changes, Do not set.</p>

<p>PROPERTIES ON DIRECTORIES ADDITIONAL_MAKE_CLEAN_FILES
Additional files to clean during the make clean stage.</p>

<p>A list of files that will be cleaned as a part of the
&quot;make clean&quot; stage.</p>

<p>CACHE_VARIABLES List of cache variables available in the
current directory.</p>

<p>This read-only property specifies the list of CMake
cache vari- ables currently defined. It is intended for
debugging purposes.</p>

<p>CLEAN_NO_CUSTOM Should the output of custom commands be
left.</p>

<p>If this is true then the outputs of custom commands for
this directory will not be removed during the &quot;make
clean&quot; stage.</p>

<p>COMPILE_DEFINITIONS Preprocessor definitions for
compiling a directorys sources.</p>

<p>The COMPILE_DEFINITIONS property may be set to a list of
prepro- cessor definitions using the syntax VAR or
VAR=value. Func- tion-style definitions are not supported.
CMake will automati- cally escape the value correctly for
the native build system (note that CMake language syntax may
require escapes to specify some values). This property may
be set on a per-configuration basis using the name
COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_&lt;CONFIG&gt; where &lt;CONFIG&gt; is
an upper-case name (ex.
&quot;COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_DEBUG&quot;). This property will
be initialized in each directory by its value in the
directorys parent.</p>

<p>CMake will automatically drop some definitions that are
not sup- ported by the native build tool. The VS6 IDE does
not support definition values with spaces (but NMake
does).</p>

<p>Dislaimer: Most native build tools have poor support for
escap- ing certain values. CMake has work-arounds for many
cases but some values may just not be possible to pass
correctly. If a value does not seem to be escaped correctly,
do not attempt to work-around the problem by adding escape
sequences to the value. Your work-around may break in a
future version of CMake that has improved escape support.
Instead consider defining the macro in a (configured) header
file. Then report the limitation.</p>

<p>COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_&lt;CONFIG&gt; Per-configuration
preprocessor definitions in a directory.</p>

<p>This is the configuration-specific version of
COMPILE_DEFINI- TIONS. This property will be initialized in
each directory by its value in the directorys parent.</p>

<p>DEFINITIONS For CMake 2.4 compatibility only. Use
COMPILE_DEFINITIONS instead.</p>

<p>This read-only property specifies the list of flags
given so far to the add_definitions command. It is intended
for debugging purposes. Use the COMPILE_DEFINITIONS
instead.</p>

<p>EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL Exclude the directory from the all
target of its parent.</p>

<p>A property on a directory that indicates if its targets
are excluded from the default build target. If it is not,
then with a Makefile for example typing make will cause the
targets to be built. The same concept applies to the default
build of other generators.</p>

<p>IMPLICIT_DEPENDS_INCLUDE_TRANSFORM Specify #include line
transforms for dependencies in a direc- tory.</p>

<p>This property specifies rules to transform macro-like
#include lines during implicit dependency scanning of C and
C++ source files. The list of rules must be
semicolon-separated with each entry of the form
&quot;A_MACRO(%)=value-with-%&quot; (the % must be lit-
eral). During dependency scanning occurrences of
A_MACRO(...) on #include lines will be replaced by the value
given with the macro argument substituted for %. For
example, the entry</p>

<p>MYDIR(%)=&lt;mydir/%&gt;</p>

<p>will convert lines of the form</p>

<p>#include MYDIR(myheader.h)</p>

<p>to</p>

<p>#include &lt;mydir/myheader.h&gt;</p>

<p>allowing the dependency to be followed.</p>

<p>This property applies to sources in all targets within a
direc- tory. The property value is initialized in each
directory by its value in the directorys parent.</p>

<p>INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES List of preprocessor include file
search directories.</p>

<p>This read-only property specifies the list of
directories given so far to the include_directories command.
It is intended for debugging purposes.</p>

<p>INCLUDE_REGULAR_EXPRESSION Include file scanning regular
expression.</p>

<p>This read-only property specifies the regular expression
used during dependency scanning to match include files that
should be followed. See the include_regular_expression
command.</p>

<p>LINK_DIRECTORIES List of linker search directories.</p>

<p>This read-only property specifies the list of
directories given so far to the link_directories command. It
is intended for debugging purposes.</p>

<p>LISTFILE_STACK The current stack of listfiles being
processed.</p>

<p>This property is mainly useful when trying to debug
errors in your CMake scripts. It returns a list of what list
files are currently being processed, in order. So if one
listfile does an INCLUDE command then that is effectively
pushing the included listfile onto the stack.</p>

<p>MACROS List of macro commands available in the current
directory.</p>

<p>This read-only property specifies the list of CMake
macros cur- rently defined. It is intended for debugging
purposes. See the macro command.</p>

<p>PARENT_DIRECTORY Source directory that added current
subdirectory.</p>

<p>This read-only property specifies the source directory
that added the current source directory as a subdirectory of
the build. In the top-level directory the value is the
empty-string.</p>

<p>TEST_INCLUDE_FILE A cmake file that will be included
when ctest is run.</p>

<p>If you specify TEST_INCLUDE_FILE, that file will be
included and processed when ctest is run on the
directory.</p>

<p>VARIABLES List of variables defined in the current
directory.</p>

<p>This read-only property specifies the list of CMake
variables currently defined. It is intended for debugging
purposes.</p>

<p>PROPERTIES ON TARGETS &lt;CONFIG&gt;_POSTFIX Postfix to
append to the target file name for configuration
&lt;CONFIG&gt;.</p>

<p>When building with configuration &lt;CONFIG&gt; the
value of this property is appended to the target file name
built on disk. For non-executable targets, this property is
initialized by the value of the variable
CMAKE_&lt;CONFIG&gt;_POSTFIX if it is set when a target is
created. This property is ignored on the Mac for Frameworks
and App Bundles.</p>

<p>ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY Output directory in which to
build ARCHIVE target files.</p>

<p>This property specifies the directory into which archive
target files should be built. There are three kinds of
target files that may be built: archive, library, and
runtime. Executables are always treated as runtime targets.
Static libraries are always treated as archive targets.
Module libraries are always treated as library targets. For
non-DLL platforms shared libraries are treated as library
targets. For DLL platforms the DLL part of a shared library
is treated as a runtime target and the corresponding import
library is treated as an archive tar- get. All Windows-based
systems including Cygwin are DLL plat- forms. This property
is initialized by the value of the variable
CMAKE_ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY if it is set when a target is
created.</p>

<p>BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH Should build tree targets have
install tree rpaths.</p>

<p>BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH is a boolean specifying whether
to link the target in the build tree with the INSTALL_RPATH.
This takes precedence over SKIP_BUILD_RPATH and avoids the
need for relink- ing before installation. This property is
initialized by the value of the variable
CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH if it is set when a target is
created.</p>

<p>CLEAN_DIRECT_OUTPUT Do not delete other variants of this
target.</p>

<p>When a library is built CMake by default generates code
to remove any existing library using all possible names.
This is needed to support libraries that switch between
STATIC and SHARED by a user option. However when using
OUTPUT_NAME to build a static and shared library of the same
name using differ- ent logical target names the two targets
will remove each other s files. This can be prevented by
setting the CLEAN_DIRECT_OUTPUT property to 1.</p>

<p>COMPILE_DEFINITIONS Preprocessor definitions for
compiling a target s sources.</p>

<p>The COMPILE_DEFINITIONS property may be set to a list of
prepro- cessor definitions using the syntax VAR or
VAR=value. Func- tion-style definitions are not supported.
CMake will automati- cally escape the value correctly for
the native build system (note that CMake language syntax may
require escapes to specify some values). This property may
be set on a per-configuration basis using the name
COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_&lt;CONFIG&gt; where &lt;CONFIG&gt; is
an upper-case name (ex.
&quot;COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_DEBUG&quot;).</p>

<p>CMake will automatically drop some definitions that are
not sup- ported by the native build tool. The VS6 IDE does
not support definition values with spaces (but NMake
does).</p>

<p>Dislaimer: Most native build tools have poor support for
escap- ing certain values. CMake has work-arounds for many
cases but some values may just not be possible to pass
correctly. If a value does not seem to be escaped correctly,
do not attempt to work-around the problem by adding escape
sequences to the value. Your work-around may break in a
future version of CMake that has improved escape support.
Instead consider defining the macro in a (configured) header
file. Then report the limitation.</p>

<p>COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_&lt;CONFIG&gt; Per-configuration
preprocessor definitions on a target.</p>

<p>This is the configuration-specific version of
COMPILE_DEFINI- TIONS.</p>

<p>COMPILE_FLAGS Additional flags to use when compiling
this targets sources.</p>

<p>The COMPILE_FLAGS property sets additional compiler
flags used to build sources within the target. Use
COMPILE_DEFINITIONS to pass additional preprocessor
definitions.</p>

<p>DEBUG_POSTFIX See target property
&lt;CONFIG&gt;_POSTFIX.</p>

<p>This property is a special case of the more-general
&lt;CON- FIG&gt;_POSTFIX property for the DEBUG
configuration.</p>

<p>DEFINE_SYMBOL Define a symbol when compiling this target
s sources.</p>

<p>DEFINE_SYMBOL sets the name of the preprocessor symbol
defined when compiling sources in a shared library. If not
set here then it is set to target_EXPORTS by default (with
some substitutions if the target is not a valid C
identifier). This is useful for headers to know whether they
are being included from inside their library our outside to
properly setup dllexport/dllimport decorations.</p>

<p>ENABLE_EXPORTS Specify whether an executable exports
symbols for loadable mod- ules.</p>

<p>Normally an executable does not export any symbols
because it is the final program. It is possible for an
executable to export symbols to be used by loadable modules.
When this property is set to true CMake will allow other
targets to &quot;link&quot; to the exe- cutable with the
TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES command. On all plat- forms a
target-level dependency on the executable is created for
targets that link to it. For non-DLL platforms the link rule
is simply ignored since the dynamic loader will
automatically bind symbols when the module is loaded. For
DLL platforms an import library will be created for the
exported symbols and then used for linking. All
Windows-based systems including Cygwin are DLL
platforms.</p>

<p>EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL Exclude the target from the all
target.</p>

<p>A property on a target that indicates if the target is
excluded from the default build target. If it is not, then
with a Make- file for example typing make will cause this
target to be built. The same concept applies to the default
build of other genera- tors. Installing a target with
EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL set to true has undefined behavior.</p>

<p>EchoString A message to be displayed when the target is
built.</p>

<p>A message to display on some generators (such as
makefiles) when the target is built.</p>

<p>FRAMEWORK This target is a framework on the Mac.</p>

<p>If a shared library target has this property set to true
it will be built as a framework when built on the mac. It
will have the directory structure required for a framework
and will be suit- able to be used with the -framework
option</p>

<p>Fortran_MODULE_DIRECTORY Specify output directory for
Fortran modules provided by the target.</p>

<p>If the target contains Fortran source files that provide
modules and the compiler supports a module output directory
this speci- fies the directory in which the modules will be
placed. When this property is not set the modules will be
placed in the build directory corresponding to the target s
source directory. If the variable
CMAKE_Fortran_MODULE_DIRECTORY is set when a target is
created its value is used to initialize this property.</p>

<p>GENERATOR_FILE_NAME Generators file for this target.</p>

<p>An internal property used by some generators to record
the name of project or dsp file associated with this
target.</p>

<p>HAS_CXX Force a target to use the CXX linker.</p>

<p>Setting HAS_CXX on a target will force the target to use
the C++ linker (and C++ runtime libraries) for linking even
if the tar- get has no C++ code in it.</p>

<p>IMPLICIT_DEPENDS_INCLUDE_TRANSFORM Specify #include line
transforms for dependencies in a target.</p>

<p>This property specifies rules to transform macro-like
#include lines during implicit dependency scanning of C and
C++ source files. The list of rules must be
semicolon-separated with each entry of the form
&quot;A_MACRO(%)=value-with-%&quot; (the % must be lit-
eral). During dependency scanning occurrences of
A_MACRO(...) on #include lines will be replaced by the value
given with the macro argument substituted for %. For
example, the entry</p>

<p>MYDIR(%)=&lt;mydir/%&gt;</p>

<p>will convert lines of the form</p>

<p>#include MYDIR(myheader.h)</p>

<p>to</p>

<p>#include &lt;mydir/myheader.h&gt;</p>

<p>allowing the dependency to be followed.</p>

<p>This property applies to sources in the target on which
it is set.</p>

<p>IMPORTED Read-only indication of whether a target is
IMPORTED.</p>

<p>The boolean value of this property is true for targets
created with the IMPORTED option to add_executable or
add_library. It is false for targets built within the
project.</p>

<p>IMPORTED_CONFIGURATIONS Configurations provided for an
IMPORTED target.</p>

<p>Lists configuration names available for an IMPORTED
target. The names correspond to configurations defined in
the project from which the target is imported. If the
importing project uses a different set of configurations the
names may be mapped using the
MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_&lt;CONFIG&gt; property. Ignored for
non-imported targets.</p>

<p>IMPORTED_IMPLIB Full path to the import library for an
IMPORTED target.</p>

<p>Specifies the location of the &quot;.lib&quot; part of a
windows DLL. Ignored for non-imported targets.</p>

<p>IMPORTED_IMPLIB_&lt;CONFIG&gt; Per-configuration version
of IMPORTED_IMPLIB property.</p>

<p>This property is used when loading settings for the
&lt;CONFIG&gt; configuration of an imported target.
Configuration names corre- spond to those provided by the
project from which the target is imported.</p>

<p>IMPORTED_LINK_DEPENDENT_LIBRARIES Dependent shared
libraries of an imported shared library.</p>

<p>Shared libraries may be linked to other shared libraries
as part of their implementation. On some platforms the
linker searches for the dependent libraries of shared
libraries they are includ- ing in the link. This property
lists the dependent shared libraries of an imported library.
The list should be disjoint from the list of interface
libraries in the IMPORTED_LINK_INTER- FACE_LIBRARIES
property. On platforms requiring dependent shared libraries
to be found at link time CMake uses this list to add
appropriate files or paths to the link command line. Ignored
for non-imported targets.</p>

<p>IMPORTED_LINK_DEPENDENT_LIBRARIES_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
Per-configuration version of
IMPORTED_LINK_DEPENDENT_LIBRARIES.</p>

<p>This property is used when loading settings for the
&lt;CONFIG&gt; configuration of an imported target.
Configuration names corre- spond to those provided by the
project from which the target is imported. If set, this
property completely overrides the generic property for the
named configuration.</p>

<p>IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES Transitive link
interface of an IMPORTED target.</p>

<p>Lists libraries whose interface is included when an
IMPORTED library target is linked to another target. The
libraries will be included on the link line for the target.
Unlike the LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES property, this property
applies to all imported target types, including STATIC
libraries. This prop- erty is ignored for non-imported
targets.</p>

<p>IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
Per-configuration version of
IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES.</p>

<p>This property is used when loading settings for the
&lt;CONFIG&gt; configuration of an imported target.
Configuration names corre- spond to those provided by the
project from which the target is imported. If set, this
property completely overrides the generic property for the
named configuration.</p>

<p>IMPORTED_LOCATION Full path to the main file on disk for
an IMPORTED target.</p>

<p>Specifies the location of an IMPORTED target file on
disk. For executables this is the location of the executable
file. For bundles on OS X this is the location of the
executable file inside Contents/MacOS under the application
bundle folder. For static libraries and modules this is the
location of the library or module. For shared libraries on
non-DLL platforms this is the location of the shared
library. For frameworks on OS X this is the location of the
library file symlink just inside the framework folder. For
DLLs this is the location of the &quot;.dll&quot; part of
the library. For UNKNOWN libraries this is the location of
the file to be linked. Ignored for non-imported targets.</p>

<p>IMPORTED_LOCATION_&lt;CONFIG&gt; Per-configuration
version of IMPORTED_LOCATION property.</p>

<p>This property is used when loading settings for the
&lt;CONFIG&gt; configuration of an imported target.
Configuration names corre- spond to those provided by the
project from which the target is imported.</p>

<p>IMPORTED_SONAME The &quot;soname&quot; of an IMPORTED
target of shared library type.</p>

<p>Specifies the &quot;soname&quot; embedded in an imported
shared library. This is meaningful only on platforms
supporting the feature. Ignored for non-imported
targets.</p>

<p>IMPORTED_SONAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt; Per-configuration version
of IMPORTED_SONAME property.</p>

<p>This property is used when loading settings for the
&lt;CONFIG&gt; configuration of an imported target.
Configuration names corre- spond to those provided by the
project from which the target is imported.</p>

<p>IMPORT_PREFIX What comes before the import library
name.</p>

<p>Similar to the target property PREFIX, but used for
import libraries (typically corresponding to a DLL) instead
of regular libraries. A target property that can be set to
override the prefix (such as &quot;lib&quot;) on an import
library name.</p>

<p>IMPORT_SUFFIX What comes after the import library
name.</p>

<p>Similar to the target property SUFFIX, but used for
import libraries (typically corresponding to a DLL) instead
of regular libraries. A target property that can be set to
override the suffix (such as &quot;.lib&quot;) on an import
library name.</p>

<p>INSTALL_NAME_DIR Mac OSX directory name for installed
targets.</p>

<p>INSTALL_NAME_DIR is a string specifying the directory
portion of the &quot;install_name&quot; field of shared
libraries on Mac OSX to use in the installed targets.</p>

<p>INSTALL_RPATH The rpath to use for installed
targets.</p>

<p>A semicolon-separated list specifying the rpath to use
in installed targets (for platforms that support it). This
prop- erty is initialized by the value of the variable
CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH if it is set when a target is
created.</p>

<p>INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH Add paths to linker search
and installed rpath.</p>

<p>INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH is a boolean that if set to
true will append directories in the linker search path and
outside the project to the INSTALL_RPATH. This property is
initialized by the value of the variable
CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH if it is set when a target
is created.</p>

<p>LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY Output directory in which to
build LIBRARY target files.</p>

<p>This property specifies the directory into which library
target files should be built. There are three kinds of
target files that may be built: archive, library, and
runtime. Executables are always treated as runtime targets.
Static libraries are always treated as archive targets.
Module libraries are always treated as library targets. For
non-DLL platforms shared libraries are treated as library
targets. For DLL platforms the DLL part of a shared library
is treated as a runtime target and the corresponding import
library is treated as an archive tar- get. All Windows-based
systems including Cygwin are DLL plat- forms. This property
is initialized by the value of the variable
CMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY if it is set when a target is
created.</p>

<p>LINKER_LANGUAGE What tool to use for linking, based on
language.</p>

<p>The LINKER_LANGUAGE property is used to change the tool
used to link an executable or shared library. The default is
set the language to match the files in the library. CXX and
C are common values for this property.</p>

<p>LINK_FLAGS Additional flags to use when linking this
target.</p>

<p>The LINK_FLAGS property can be used to add extra flags
to the link step of a target. LINK_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt; will
add to the con- figuration &lt;CONFIG&gt;, for example,
DEBUG, RELEASE, MINSIZEREL, RELWITHDEBINFO.</p>

<p>LINK_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt; Per-configuration linker flags
for a target.</p>

<p>This is the configuration-specific version of
LINK_FLAGS.</p>

<p>LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES List public interface libraries
for a shared library or exe- cutable.</p>

<p>By default linking to a shared library target
transitively links to targets with which the library itself
was linked. For an executable with exports (see the
ENABLE_EXPORTS property) no default transitive link
dependencies are used. This property replaces the default
transitive link dependencies with an explict list. When the
target is linked into another target the libraries listed
(and recursively their link interface libraries) will be
provided to the other target also. If the list is empty then
no transitive link dependencies will be incorporated when
this target is linked into another target even if the
default set is non-empty. This property is ignored for
STATIC libraries.</p>

<p>LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
Per-configuration list of public interface libraries for a
tar- get.</p>

<p>This is the configuration-specific version of
LINK_INTER- FACE_LIBRARIES. If set, this property completely
overrides the generic property for the named
configuration.</p>

<p>LINK_SEARCH_END_STATIC End a link line such that static
system libraries are used.</p>

<p>Some linkers support switches such as -Bstatic and
-Bdynamic to determine whether to use static or shared
libraries for -lXXX options. CMake uses these options to set
the link type for libraries whose full paths are not known
or (in some cases) are in implicit link directories for the
platform. By default the linker search type is left at
-Bdynamic by the end of the library list. This property
switches the final linker search type to -Bstatic.</p>

<p>LOCATION Read-only location of a target on disk.</p>

<p>For an imported target, this read-only property returns
the value of the LOCATION_&lt;CONFIG&gt; property for an
unspecified con- figuration &lt;CONFIG&gt; provided by the
target.</p>

<p>For a non-imported target, this property is provided for
compat- ibility with CMake 2.4 and below. It was meant to
get the loca- tion of an executable targets output file for
use in add_cus- tom_command. The path may contain a
build-system-specific por- tion that is replaced at build
time with the configuration get- ting built (such as
&quot;$(ConfigurationName)&quot; in VS). In CMake 2.6 and
above add_custom_command automatically recognizes a target
name in its COMMAND and DEPENDS options and computes the
target location. Therefore this property is not needed for
creating custom commands.</p>

<p>LOCATION_&lt;CONFIG&gt; Read-only property providing a
target location on disk.</p>

<p>A read-only property that indicates where a targets main
file is located on disk for the configuration
&lt;CONFIG&gt;. The property is defined only for library and
executable targets. An imported target may provide a set of
configurations different from that of the importing project.
By default CMake looks for an exact-match but otherwise uses
an arbitrary available configura- tion. Use the
MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_&lt;CONFIG&gt; property to map imported
configurations explicitly.</p>

<p>MACOSX_BUNDLE Build an executable as an application
bundle on Mac OS X.</p>

<p>When this property is set to true the executable when
built on Mac OS X will be created as an application bundle.
This makes it a GUI executable that can be launched from the
Finder. See the MACOSX_BUNDLE_INFO_PLIST target property for
information about creation of the Info.plist file for the
application bun- dle.</p>

<p>MACOSX_BUNDLE_INFO_PLIST Specify a custom Info.plist
template for a Mac OS X App Bundle.</p>

<p>An executable target with MACOSX_BUNDLE enabled will be
built as an application bundle on Mac OS X. By default its
Info.plist file is created by configuring a template called
MacOSXBundle- Info.plist.in located in the
CMAKE_MODULE_PATH. This property specifies an alternative
template file name which may be a full path.</p>

<p>The following target properties may be set to specify
content to be configured into the file:</p>

<p>MACOSX_BUNDLE_INFO_STRING MACOSX_BUNDLE_ICON_FILE
MACOSX_BUNDLE_GUI_IDENTIFIER
MACOSX_BUNDLE_LONG_VERSION_STRING MACOSX_BUNDLE_BUNDLE_NAME
MACOSX_BUNDLE_SHORT_VERSION_STRING
MACOSX_BUNDLE_BUNDLE_VERSION MACOSX_BUNDLE_COPYRIGHT</p>

<p>CMake variables of the same name may be set to affect
all tar- gets in a directory that do not have each specific
property set. If a custom Info.plist is specified by this
property it may of course hard-code all the settings instead
of using the target properties.</p>

<p>MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_INFO_PLIST Specify a custom Info.plist
template for a Mac OS X Framework.</p>

<p>An library target with FRAMEWORK enabled will be built
as a framework on Mac OS X. By default its Info.plist file
is cre- ated by configuring a template called
MacOSXFramework- Info.plist.in located in the
CMAKE_MODULE_PATH. This property specifies an alternative
template file name which may be a full path.</p>

<p>The following target properties may be set to specify
content to be configured into the file:</p>

<p>MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_ICON_FILE MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_IDENTIFIER
MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_SHORT_VERSION_STRING
MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_BUNDLE_VERSION</p>

<p>CMake variables of the same name may be set to affect
all tar- gets in a directory that do not have each specific
property set. If a custom Info.plist is specified by this
property it may of course hard-code all the settings instead
of using the target properties.</p>

<p>MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_&lt;CONFIG&gt; Map from project
configuration to IMPORTED target s configura- tion.</p>

<p>List configurations of an imported target that may be
used for the current project s &lt;CONFIG&gt; configuration.
Targets imported from another project may not provide the
same set of configura- tion names available in the current
project. Setting this prop- erty tells CMake what imported
configurations are suitable for use when building the
&lt;CONFIG&gt; configuration. The first config- uration in
the list found to be provided by the imported target is
selected. If no matching configurations are available the
imported target is considered to be not found. This property
is ignored for non-imported targets.</p>

<p>OUTPUT_NAME Sets the real name of a target when it is
built.</p>

<p>Sets the real name of a target when it is built and can
be used to help create two targets of the same name even
though CMake requires unique logical target names. There is
also a &lt;CON- FIG&gt;_OUTPUT_NAME that can set the output
name on a per-configu- ration basis.</p>

<p>POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT Deprecated install support.</p>

<p>The PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT and POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT
properties are the old way to specify CMake scripts to run
before and after installing a target. They are used only
when the old INSTALL_TARGETS command is used to install the
target. Use the INSTALL command instead.</p>

<p>PREFIX What comes before the library name.</p>

<p>A target property that can be set to override the prefix
(such as &quot;lib&quot;) on a library name.</p>

<p>PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT Deprecated install support.</p>

<p>The PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT and POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT
properties are the old way to specify CMake scripts to run
before and after installing a target. They are used only
when the old INSTALL_TARGETS command is used to install the
target. Use the INSTALL command instead.</p>

<p>PRIVATE_HEADER Specify private header files in a
FRAMEWORK shared library tar- get.</p>

<p>Shared library targets marked with the FRAMEWORK
property gener- ate frameworks on OS X and normal shared
libraries on other platforms. This property may be set to a
list of header files to be placed in the PrivateHeaders
directory inside the frame- work folder. On non-Apple
platforms these headers may be installed using the
PRIVATE_HEADER option to the install(TAR- GETS) command.</p>

<p>PROJECT_LABEL Change the name of a target in an IDE.</p>

<p>Can be used to change the name of the target in an IDE
like visual stuido.</p>

<p>PUBLIC_HEADER Specify public header files in a FRAMEWORK
shared library tar- get.</p>

<p>Shared library targets marked with the FRAMEWORK
property gener- ate frameworks on OS X and normal shared
libraries on other platforms. This property may be set to a
list of header files to be placed in the Headers directory
inside the framework folder. On non-Apple platforms these
headers may be installed using the PUBLIC_HEADER option to
the install(TARGETS) command.</p>

<p>RESOURCE Specify resource files in a FRAMEWORK shared
library target.</p>

<p>Shared library targets marked with the FRAMEWORK
property gener- ate frameworks on OS X and normal shared
libraries on other platforms. This property may be set to a
list of files to be placed in the Resources directory inside
the framework folder. On non-Apple platforms these files may
be installed using the RESOURCE option to the
install(TARGETS) command.</p>

<p>RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY Output directory in which to
build RUNTIME target files.</p>

<p>This property specifies the directory into which runtime
target files should be built. There are three kinds of
target files that may be built: archive, library, and
runtime. Executables are always treated as runtime targets.
Static libraries are always treated as archive targets.
Module libraries are always treated as library targets. For
non-DLL platforms shared libraries are treated as library
targets. For DLL platforms the DLL part of a shared library
is treated as a runtime target and the corresponding import
library is treated as an archive tar- get. All Windows-based
systems including Cygwin are DLL plat- forms. This property
is initialized by the value of the variable
CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY if it is set when a target is
created.</p>

<p>SKIP_BUILD_RPATH Should rpaths be used for the build
tree.</p>

<p>SKIP_BUILD_RPATH is a boolean specifying whether to skip
auto- matic generation of an rpath allowing the target to
run from the build tree. This property is initialized by the
value of the variable CMAKE_SKIP_BUILD_RPATH if it is set
when a target is created.</p>

<p>SOURCES Source names specified for a target.</p>

<p>Read-only list of sources specified for a target. The
names returned are suitable for passing to the
set_source_files_prop- erties command.</p>

<p>SOVERSION What version number is this target.</p>

<p>For shared libraries VERSION and SOVERSION can be used
to spec- ify the build version and api version respectively.
When build- ing or installing appropriate symlinks are
created if the plat- form supports symlinks and the linker
supports so-names. If only one of both is specified the
missing is assumed to have the same version number. For
shared libraries and executables on Windows the VERSION
attribute is parsed to extract a &quot;major.minor&quot;
ver- sion number. These numbers are used as the image
version of the binary.</p>

<p>STATIC_LIBRARY_FLAGS Extra flags to use when linking
static libraries.</p>

<p>Extra flags to use when linking a static library.</p>

<p>SUFFIX What comes after the library name.</p>

<p>A target property that can be set to override the suffix
(such as &quot;.so&quot;) on a library name.</p>

<p>TYPE The type of the target.</p>

<p>This read-only property can be used to test the type of
the given target. It will be one of STATIC_LIBRARY,
MODULE_LIBRARY, SHARED_LIBRARY, EXECUTABLE or one of the
internal target types.</p>

<p>VERSION What version number is this target.</p>

<p>For shared libraries VERSION and SOVERSION can be used
to spec- ify the build version and api version respectively.
When build- ing or installing appropriate symlinks are
created if the plat- form supports symlinks and the linker
supports so-names. If only one of both is specified the
missing is assumed to have the same version number. For
executables VERSION can be used to specify the build
version. When building or installing appropriate sym- links
are created if the platform supports symlinks. For shared
libraries and executables on Windows the VERSION attribute
is parsed to extract a &quot;major.minor&quot; version
number. These numbers are used as the image version of the
binary.</p>

<p>VS_KEYWORD Visual Studio project keyword.</p>

<p>Can be set to change the visual studio keyword, for
example QT integration works better if this is set to
Qt4VSv1.0.</p>

<p>VS_SCC_LOCALPATH Visual Studio Source Code Control
Provider.</p>

<p>Can be set to change the visual studio source code
control local path property.</p>

<p>VS_SCC_PROJECTNAME Visual Studio Source Code Control
Project.</p>

<p>Can be set to change the visual studio source code
control project name property.</p>

<p>VS_SCC_PROVIDER Visual Studio Source Code Control
Provider.</p>

<p>Can be set to change the visual studio source code
control provider property.</p>

<p>WIN32_EXECUTABLE Build an executable with a WinMain
entry point on windows.</p>

<p>When this property is set to true the executable when
linked on Windows will be created with a WinMain() entry
point instead of of just main().This makes it a GUI
executable instead of a con- sole application. See the
CMAKE_MFC_FLAG variable documentation to configure use of
MFC for WinMain executables.</p>

<p>XCODE_ATTRIBUTE_&lt;an-attribute&gt; Set Xcode target
attributes directly.</p>

<p>Tell the Xcode generator to set &lt;an-attribute&gt; to
a given value in the generated Xcode project. Ignored on
other genera- tors.</p>

<p>PROPERTIES ON TESTS FAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION If the
output matches this regular expression the test will
fail.</p>

<p>If set, if the output matches one of specified regular
expres- sions, the test will fail.For example:
PASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION
&quot;[^a-z]Error;ERROR;Failed&quot;</p>

<p>MEASUREMENT Specify a DART measurement and value to be
reported for a test.</p>

<p>If set to a name then that name will be reported to DART
as a named measurement with a value of 1. You may also
specify a value by setting MEASUREMENT to
&quot;measurement=value&quot;.</p>

<p>PASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION The output must match this
regular expression for the test to pass.</p>

<p>If set, the test output will be checked against the
specified regular expressions and at least one of the
regular expressions has to match, otherwise the test will
fail.</p>

<p>TIMEOUT How many seconds to allow for this test.</p>

<p>This property if set will limit a test to not take more
than the specified number of seconds to run. If it exceeds
that the test process will be killed and ctest will move to
the next test. This setting takes precedence over
DART_TESTING_TIMEOUT and CTEST_TESTING_TIMEOUT.</p>

<p>WILL_FAIL If set to true, this will invert the pass/fail
flag of the test.</p>

<p>This property can be used for tests that are expected to
fail and return a non zero return code.</p>

<p>PROPERTIES ON SOURCE FILES ABSTRACT Is this source file
an abstract class.</p>

<p>A property on a source file that indicates if the source
file represents a class that is abstract. This only makes
sense for languages that have a notion of an abstract class
and it is only used by some tools that wrap classes into
other languages.</p>

<p>COMPILE_DEFINITIONS Preprocessor definitions for
compiling a source file.</p>

<p>The COMPILE_DEFINITIONS property may be set to a list of
prepro- cessor definitions using the syntax VAR or
VAR=value. Func- tion-style definitions are not supported.
CMake will automati- cally escape the value correctly for
the native build system (note that CMake language syntax may
require escapes to specify some values). This property may
be set on a per-configuration basis using the name
COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_&lt;CONFIG&gt; where &lt;CONFIG&gt; is
an upper-case name (ex.
&quot;COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_DEBUG&quot;).</p>

<p>CMake will automatically drop some definitions that are
not sup- ported by the native build tool. The VS6 IDE does
not support definition values with spaces (but NMake does).
Xcode does not support per-configuration definitions on
source files.</p>

<p>Dislaimer: Most native build tools have poor support for
escap- ing certain values. CMake has work-arounds for many
cases but some values may just not be possible to pass
correctly. If a value does not seem to be escaped correctly,
do not attempt to work-around the problem by adding escape
sequences to the value. Your work-around may break in a
future version of CMake that has improved escape support.
Instead consider defining the macro in a (configured) header
file. Then report the limitation.</p>

<p>COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_&lt;CONFIG&gt; Per-configuration
preprocessor definitions on a source file.</p>

<p>This is the configuration-specific version of
COMPILE_DEFINI- TIONS. Note that Xcode does not support
per-configuration source file flags so this property will be
ignored by the Xcode generator.</p>

<p>COMPILE_FLAGS Additional flags to be added when
compiling this source file.</p>

<p>These flags will be added to the list of compile flags
when this source file builds. Use COMPILE_DEFINITIONS to
pass additional preprocessor definitions.</p>

<p>EXTERNAL_OBJECT If set to true then this is an object
file.</p>

<p>If this property is set to true then the source file is
really an object file and should not be compiled. It will
still be linked into the target though.</p>

<p>GENERATED Is this source file generated as part of the
build process.</p>

<p>If a source file is generated by the build process CMake
will handle it differently in temrs of dependency checking
etc. Oth- erwise having a non-existent source file could
create problems.</p>

<p>HEADER_FILE_ONLY Is this source file only a header
file.</p>

<p>A property on a source file that indicates if the source
file is a header file with no associated implementation.
This is set automatically based on the file extension and is
used by CMake to determine is certain dependency information
should be com- puted.</p>

<p>KEEP_EXTENSION Make the output file have the same
extension as the source file.</p>

<p>If this property is set then the file extension of the
output file will be the same as that of the source file.
Normally the output file extension is computed based on the
language of the source file, for example .cxx will go to a
.o extension.</p>

<p>LANGUAGE What programming language is the file.</p>

<p>A property that can be set to indicate what programming
language the source file is. If it is not set the language
is determined based on the file extension. Typical values
are CXX C etc.</p>

<p>LOCATION The full path to a source file.</p>

<p>A read only property on a SOURCE FILE that contains the
full path to the source file.</p>

<p>MACOSX_PACKAGE_LOCATION Place a source file inside a Mac
OS X bundle or framework.</p>

<p>Executable targets with the MACOSX_BUNDLE property set
are built as Mac OS X application bundles on Apple
platforms. Shared library targets with the FRAMEWORK
property set are built as Mac OS X frameworks on Apple
platforms. Source files listed in the target with this
property set will be copied to a directory inside the bundle
or framework content folder specified by the property value.
For bundles the content folder is
&quot;&lt;name&gt;.app/Contents&quot;. For frameworks the
content folder is
&quot;&lt;name&gt;.framework/Versions/&lt;version&gt;&quot;.
See the PUBLIC_HEADER, PRIVATE_HEADER, and RESOURCE target
properties for specifying files meant for Headers,
PrivateHeadres, or Resources directo- ries.</p>

<p>OBJECT_DEPENDS Additional files on which a compiled
object file depends.</p>

<p>Specifies a semicolon-separated list of full-paths to
files on which any object files compiled from this source
file depend. An object file will be recompiled if any of the
named files is newer than it.</p>

<p>This property need not be used to specify the dependency
of a source file on a generated header file that it
includes. Although the property was originally introduced
for this purpose, it is no longer necessary. If the
generated header file is created by a custom command in the
same target as the source file, the automatic dependency
scanning process will rec- ognize the dependency. If the
generated header file is created by another target, an
inter-target dependency should be created with the
add_dependencies command (if one does not already exist due
to linking relationships).</p>

<p>OBJECT_OUTPUTS Additional outputs for a Makefile
rule.</p>

<p>Additional outputs created by compilation of this source
file. If any of these outputs is missing the object will be
recom- piled. This is supported only on Makefile generators
and will be ignored on other generators.</p>

<p>SYMBOLIC Is this just a name for a rule.</p>

<p>If SYMBOLIC (boolean) is set to true the build system
will be informed that the source file is not actually
created on disk but instead used as a symbolic name for a
build rule.</p>

<p>WRAP_EXCLUDE Exclude this source file from any code
wrapping techniques.</p>

<p>Some packages can wrap source files into alternate
languages to provide additional functionality. For example,
C++ code can be wrapped into Java or Python etc using SWIG
etc. If WRAP_EXCLUDE is set to true (1 etc) that indicates
then this source file should not be wrapped.</p>

<p>COMPATIBILITY COMMANDS CMake Compatibility Listfile
Commands - Obsolete commands supported by CMake for
compatibility.</p>

<p>This is the documentation for now obsolete listfile
commands from pre- vious CMake versions, which are still
supported for compatibility rea- sons. You should instead
use the newer, faster and shinier new com- mands. ;-)</p>

<p>COMPATILBILITY COMMANDS build_name Deprecated. Use
${CMAKE_SYSTEM} and ${CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER} instead.</p>

<p>build_name(variable)</p>

<p>Sets the specified variable to a string representing the
plat- form and compiler settings. These values are now
available through the CMAKE_SYSTEM and CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER
variables.</p>

<p>exec_program Deprecated. Use the execute_process()
command instead.</p>

<p>Run an executable program during the processing of the
CMake- List.txt file.</p>

<p>exec_program(Executable [directory in which to run]
[ARGS &lt;arguments to executable&gt;] [OUTPUT_VARIABLE
&lt;var&gt;] [RETURN_VALUE &lt;var&gt;])</p>

<p>The executable is run in the optionally specified
directory. The executable can include arguments if it is
double quoted, but it is better to use the optional ARGS
argument to specify argu- ments to the program. This is
because cmake will then be able to escape spaces in the
executable path. An optional argument OUTPUT_VARIABLE
specifies a variable in which to store the output. To
capture the return value of the execution, provide a
RETURN_VALUE. If OUTPUT_VARIABLE is specified, then no
output will go to the stdout/stderr of the console running
cmake.</p>

<p>export_library_dependencies Deprecated. Use
INSTALL(EXPORT) or EXPORT command.</p>

<p>This command generates an old-style library dependencies
file. Projects requiring CMake 2.6 or later should not use
the com- mand. Use instead the install(EXPORT) command to
help export targets from an installation tree and the
export() command to export targets from a build tree.</p>

<p>The old-style library dependencies file does not take
into account per-configuration names of libraries or the
LINK_INTER- FACE_LIBRARIES target property.</p>

<p>export_library_dependencies(&lt;file&gt; [APPEND])</p>

<p>Create a file named &lt;file&gt; that can be included
into a CMake listfile with the INCLUDE command. The file
will contain a num- ber of SET commands that will set all
the variables needed for library dependency information.
This should be the last command in the top level
CMakeLists.txt file of the project. If the APPEND option is
specified, the SET commands will be appended to the given
file instead of replacing it.</p>

<p>install_files Deprecated. Use the install(FILES )
command instead.</p>

<p>This command has been superceded by the install command.
It is provided for compatibility with older CMake code. The
FILES form is directly replaced by the FILES form of the
install com- mand. The regexp form can be expressed more
clearly using the GLOB form of the file command.</p>

<p>install_files(&lt;dir&gt; extension file file ...)</p>

<p>Create rules to install the listed files with the given
exten- sion into the given directory. Only files existing in
the cur- rent source tree or its corresponding location in
the binary tree may be listed. If a file specified already
has an exten- sion, that extension will be removed first.
This is useful for providing lists of source files such as
foo.cxx when you want the corresponding foo.h to be
installed. A typical extension is .h.</p>

<p>install_files(&lt;dir&gt; regexp)</p>

<p>Any files in the current source directory that match the
regular expression will be installed.</p>

<p>install_files(&lt;dir&gt; FILES file file ...)</p>

<p>Any files listed after the FILES keyword will be
installed explicitly from the names given. Full paths are
allowed in this form.</p>

<p>The directory &lt;dir&gt; is relative to the
installation prefix, which is stored in the variable
CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.</p>

<p>install_programs Deprecated. Use the install(PROGRAMS )
command instead.</p>

<p>This command has been superceded by the install command.
It is provided for compatibility with older CMake code. The
FILES form is directly replaced by the PROGRAMS form of the
INSTALL command. The regexp form can be expressed more
clearly using the GLOB form of the FILE command.</p>

<p>install_programs(&lt;dir&gt; file1 file2 [file3 ...])
install_programs(&lt;dir&gt; FILES file1 [file2 ...])</p>

<p>Create rules to install the listed programs into the
given directory. Use the FILES argument to guarantee that
the file list version of the command will be used even when
there is only one argument.</p>

<p>install_programs(&lt;dir&gt; regexp)</p>

<p>In the second form any program in the current source
directory that matches the regular expression will be
installed.</p>

<p>This command is intended to install programs that are
not built by cmake, such as shell scripts. See the TARGETS
form of the INSTALL command to create installation rules for
targets built by cmake.</p>

<p>The directory &lt;dir&gt; is relative to the
installation prefix, which is stored in the variable
CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.</p>

<p>install_targets Deprecated. Use the install(TARGETS )
command instead.</p>

<p>This command has been superceded by the install command.
It is provided for compatibility with older CMake code.</p>

<p>install_targets(&lt;dir&gt; [RUNTIME_DIRECTORY dir]
target target)</p>

<p>Create rules to install the listed targets into the
given direc- tory. The directory &lt;dir&gt; is relative to
the installation pre- fix, which is stored in the variable
CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX. If RUNTIME_DIRECTORY is specified,
then on systems with special runtime files (Windows DLL),
the files will be copied to that directory.</p>

<p>link_libraries Deprecated. Use the
target_link_libraries() command instead.</p>

<p>Link libraries to all targets added later.</p>

<p>link_libraries(library1 &lt;debug | optimized&gt;
library2 ...)</p>

<p>Specify a list of libraries to be linked into any
following tar- gets (typically added with the add_executable
or add_library calls). This command is passed down to all
subdirectories. The debug and optimized strings may be used
to indicate that the next library listed is to be used only
for that specific type of build.</p>

<p>make_directory Deprecated. Use the file(MAKE_DIRECTORY )
command instead.</p>

<p>make_directory(directory)</p>

<p>Creates the specified directory. Full paths should be
given. Any parent directories that do not exist will also be
created. Use with care.</p>

<p>remove Deprecated. Use the list(REMOVE_ITEM ) command
instead.</p>

<p>remove(VAR VALUE VALUE ...)</p>

<p>Removes VALUE from the variable VAR. This is typically
used to remove entries from a vector (e.g. semicolon
separated list). VALUE is expanded.</p>

<p>subdir_depends Deprecated. Does nothing.</p>

<p>subdir_depends(subdir dep1 dep2 ...)</p>

<p>Does not do anything. This command used to help projects
order parallel builds correctly. This functionality is now
automatic.</p>

<p>subdirs Deprecated. Use the add_subdirectory() command
instead.</p>

<p>Add a list of subdirectories to the build.</p>

<p>subdirs(dir1 dir2 ...[EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL exclude_dir1
exclude_dir2 ...] [PREORDER] )</p>

<p>Add a list of subdirectories to the build. The
add_subdirectory command should be used instead of subdirs
although subdirs will still work. This will cause any
CMakeLists.txt files in the sub directories to be processed
by CMake. Any directories after the PREORDER flag are
traversed first by makefile builds, the PRE- ORDER flag has
no effect on IDE projects. Any directories after the
EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL marker will not be included in the top
level makefile or project file. This is useful for having
CMake create makefiles or projects for a set of examples in
a project. You would want CMake to generate makefiles or
project files for all the examples at the same time, but you
would not want them to show up in the top level project or
be built each time make is run from the top.</p>

<p>use_mangled_mesa Copy mesa headers for use in
combination with system GL.</p>

<p>use_mangled_mesa(PATH_TO_MESA OUTPUT_DIRECTORY)</p>

<p>The path to mesa includes, should contain gl_mangle.h.
The mesa headers are copied to the specified output
directory. This allows mangled mesa headers to override
other GL headers by being added to the include directory
path earlier.</p>

<p>utility_source Specify the source tree of a third-party
utility.</p>

<p>utility_source(cache_entry executable_name
path_to_source [file1 file2 ...])</p>

<p>When a third-party utilitys source is included in the
distribu- tion, this command specifies its location and
name. The cache entry will not be set unless the
path_to_source and all listed files exist. It is assumed
that the source tree of the utility will have been built
before it is needed.</p>

<p>When cross compiling CMake will print a warning if a
util- ity_source() command is executed, because in many
cases it is used to build an executable which is executed
later on. This doesn t work when cross compiling, since the
executable can run only on their target platform. So in this
case the cache entry has to be adjusted manually so it
points to an executable which is runnable on the build
host.</p>

<p>variable_requires Deprecated. Use the if() command
instead.</p>

<p>Assert satisfaction of an option s required
variables.</p>

<p>variable_requires(TEST_VARIABLE RESULT_VARIABLE
REQUIRED_VARIABLE1 REQUIRED_VARIABLE2 ...)</p>

<p>The first argument (TEST_VARIABLE) is the name of the
variable to be tested, if that variable is false nothing
else is done. If TEST_VARIABLE is true, then the next
argument (RESULT_VARIABLE) is a variable that is set to true
if all the required variables are set. The rest of the
arguments are variables that must be true or not set to
NOTFOUND to avoid an error. If any are not true, an error is
reported.</p>

<p>write_file Deprecated. Use the file(WRITE ) command
instead.</p>

<p>write_file(filename &quot;message to write&quot;...
[APPEND])</p>

<p>The first argument is the file name, the rest of the
arguments are messages to write. If the argument APPEND is
specified, then the message will be appended.</p>

<p>NOTE 1: file(WRITE ... and file(APPEND ... do exactly
the same as this one but add some more functionality.</p>

<p>NOTE 2: When using write_file the produced file cannot
be used as an input to CMake (CONFIGURE_FILE, source file
...) because it will lead to an infinite loop. Use
configure_file if you want to generate input files to
CMake.</p>

<p>MODULES The following modules are provided with CMake.
They can be used with INCLUDE(ModuleName).</p>

<p>CMake Modules - Modules coming with CMake, the
Cross-Platform Makefile Generator.</p>

<p>This is the documentation for the modules and scripts
coming with CMake. Using these modules you can check the
computer system for installed software packages, features of
the compiler and the existance of headers to name just a
few.</p>

<p>AddFileDependencies ADD_FILE_DEPENDENCIES(source_file
depend_files...)</p>

<p>Adds the given files as dependencies to source_file</p>

<p>BundleUtilities</p>

<p>BundleUtilities.cmake</p>

<p>A collection of CMake utility functions useful for
dealing with .app bundles on the Mac and bundle-like
directories on any OS.</p>

<p>The following functions are provided by this script:</p>

<p>get_bundle_main_executable get_dotapp_dir
get_bundle_and_executable get_bundle_all_executables
get_item_key clear_bundle_keys set_bundle_key_values
get_bundle_keys copy_resolved_item_into_bundle
fixup_bundle_item fixup_bundle copy_and_fixup_bundle
verify_bundle_prerequisites verify_bundle_symlinks
verify_app</p>

<p>Requires CMake 2.6 or greater because it uses function,
break and PARENT_SCOPE. Also depends on
GetPrerequisites.cmake.</p>

<p>CMakeASM-ATTInformation</p>

<p>support for AT&amp;T syntax assemblers, e.g. GNU as</p>

<p>CMakeASM_MASMInformation</p>

<p>support for the MS assembler, masm and masm64</p>

<p>CMakeBackwardCompatibilityCXX define a bunch of
backwards compatibility variables</p>

<p>CMAKE_ANSI_CXXFLAGS - flag for ansi c++
CMAKE_HAS_ANSI_STRING_STREAM - has &lt;strstream&gt;
INCLUDE(TestForANSIStreamHeaders)
INCLUDE(CheckIncludeFileCXX) INCLUDE(TestForSTDNamespace)
INCLUDE(TestForANSIForScope)</p>

<p>CMakeDependentOption Macro to provide an option
dependent on other options.</p>

<p>This macro presents an option to the user only if a set
of other conditions are true. When the option is not
presented a default value is used, but any value set by the
user is preserved for when the option is presented again.
Example invocation:</p>

<p>CMAKE_DEPENDENT_OPTION(USE_FOO &quot;Use Foo&quot; ON
&quot;USE_BAR;NOT USE_ZOT&quot; OFF)</p>

<p>If USE_BAR is true and USE_ZOT is false, this provides
an option called USE_FOO that defaults to ON. Otherwise, it
sets USE_FOO to OFF. If the status of USE_BAR or USE_ZOT
ever changes, any value for the USE_FOO option is saved so
that when the option is re-enabled it retains its old
value.</p>

<p>CMakeDetermineASM-ATTCompiler</p>

<p>determine the compiler to use for ASM using AT&amp;T
syntax, e.g. GNU as</p>

<p>CMakeDetermineASMCompiler</p>

<p>determine the compiler to use for ASM programs</p>

<p>CMakeDetermineASM_MASMCompiler</p>

<p>Find the MS assembler (masm or masm64)</p>

<p>CMakeExportBuildSettings export build settings from a
project.</p>

<p>CMAKE_EXPORT_BUILD_SETTINGS(SETTINGS_FILE)</p>

<p>macro defined to export the build settings for use by
another project.</p>

<p>SETTINGS_FILE - the file into which the settings are to
be stored.</p>

<p>CMakeFindFrameworks helper module to find OSX
frameworks</p>

<p>CMakeForceCompiler</p>

<p>This module defines macros intended for use by
cross-compiling toolchain files when CMake is not able to
automatically detect the compiler identification.</p>

<p>Macro CMAKE_FORCE_C_COMPILER has the following
signature:</p>

<p>CMAKE_FORCE_C_COMPILER(&lt;compiler&gt;
&lt;compiler-id&gt;)</p>

<p>It sets CMAKE_C_COMPILER to the given compiler and the
cmake internal variable CMAKE_C_COMPILER_ID to the given
compiler-id. It also bypasses the check for working compiler
and basic com- piler information tests.</p>

<p>Macro CMAKE_FORCE_CXX_COMPILER has the following
signature:</p>

<p>CMAKE_FORCE_CXX_COMPILER(&lt;compiler&gt;
&lt;compiler-id&gt;)</p>

<p>It sets CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER to the given compiler and the
cmake internal variable CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_ID to the given
com- piler-id. It also bypasses the check for working
compiler and basic compiler information tests.</p>

<p>So a simple toolchain file could look like this:</p>

<p>INCLUDE (CMakeForceCompiler) SET(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME
Generic) CMAKE_FORCE_C_COMPILER (chc12 MetrowerksHicross)
CMAKE_FORCE_CXX_COMPILER (chc12 MetrowerksHicross)</p>

<p>CMakeImportBuildSettings import build settings from
another project</p>

<p>CMAKE_IMPORT_BUILD_SETTINGS(SETTINGS_FILE)</p>

<p>macro defined to import the build settings from another
project. SETTINGS_FILE is a file created by the other
projects call to the CMAKE_EXPORT_BUILD_SETTINGS macro, see
CMakeExportBuildSet- tings.</p>

<p>CMakeJavaInformation</p>

<p>This should be included before the _INIT variables are
used to initialize the cache. Since the rule variables have
if blocks on them, users can still define them here. But, it
should still be after the platform file so changes can be
made to those val- ues.</p>

<p>CMakePrintSystemInformation print system information</p>

<p>This file can be used for diagnostic purposes just
include it in a project to see various internal CMake
variables.</p>

<p>CPack Build binary and source package installers</p>

<p>The CPack module generates binary and source installers
in a variety of formats using the cpack program. Inclusion
of the CPack module adds two new targets to the resulting
makefiles, package and package_source, which build the
binary and source installers, respectively. The generated
binary installers con- tain everything installed via CMake s
INSTALL command (and the deprecated INSTALL_FILES,
INSTALL_PROGRAMS, and INSTALL_TARGETS commands).</p>

<p>For certain kinds of binary installers (including the
graphical installers on Mac OS X and Windows), CPack
generates installers that allow users to select individual
application components to install. The contents of each of
the components are identified by the COMPONENT argument of
CMake s INSTALL command. These com- ponents can be annotated
with user-friendly names and descrip- tions, inter-component
dependencies, etc., and grouped in vari- ous ways to
customize the resulting installer. See the cpack_add_*
commands, described below, for more information about
component-specific installations.</p>

<p>Before including the CPack module, there are a variety
of vari- ables that can be set to customize the resulting
installers. The most commonly-used variables are:</p>

<p>CPACK_PACKAGE_NAME - The name of the package (or
application). If not specified, defaults to the project
name.</p>

<p>CPACK_PACKAGE_VENDOR - The name of the package vendor

ccmake.</p>

<p>CPACK_STRIP_FILES - List of files to be stripped.
Starting with CMake 2.6.0 CPACK_STRIP_FILES will be a
boolean variable which enables stripping of all files (a
list of files evaluates to TRUE in CMake, so this change is
compatible).</p>

<p>The following CPack variables are specific to source
packages, and will not affect binary packages:</p>

<p>CPACK_SOURCE_PACKAGE_FILE_NAME - The name of the source
package, e.g., cmake-2.6.1</p>

<p>CPACK_SOURCE_STRIP_FILES - List of files in the source
tree that will be stripped. Starting with CMake 2.6.0
CPACK_SOURCE_STRIP_FILES will be a boolean variable which
enables stripping of all files (a list of files evaluates to
TRUE in CMake, so this change is compatible).</p>

<p>CPACK_SOURCE_GENERATOR - List of generators used for the
source packages. As with CPACK_GENERATOR, if this is not
specified then CPack will create a set of options (e.g.,
CPACK_SOURCE_ZIP) allowing users to select which packages

on Mac OS X using PackageMaker:</p>

<p>CPACK_OSX_PACKAGE_VERSION - The version of Mac OS X that
the resulting PackageMaker archive should be compatible
with. Different versions of Mac OS X support different
features. For example, CPack can only build component-based
installers for Mac OS X 10.4 or newer, and can only build
installers that download component son-the-fly for Mac OS X
10.5 or newer. If left blank, this value will be set to the
minimum version of Mac OS X that supports the requested
features. Set this variable to some value (e.g., 10.4) only
if you want to guarantee that your installer will work on
that version of Mac OS X, and don t mind missing extra
features available in the installer shipping with later
versions of Mac OS X.</p>

<p>The following variables are for advanced uses of
CPack:</p>

<p>CPACK_CMAKE_GENERATOR - What CMake generator should be

of ${CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME}.</p>

<p>CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION - Package full version, used
internally. By default, this is built from
CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MAJOR, CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MINOR,
and CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_PATCH.</p>

files.</p>

<p>CPACK_INSTALL_COMMANDS - Extra commands to install
components.</p>

<p>CPACK_INSTALL_DIRECTORIES - Extra directories to

<p>Component-specific installation allows users to select
specific sets of components to install during the install
process. Installation components are identified by the
COMPONENT argument of CMakes INSTALL commands, and should be
further described by the following CPack commands:</p>

<p>cpack_add_component - Describes a CPack installation
component named by the COMPONENT argument to a CMake INSTALL
command.</p>

<p>cpack_add_component(compname [DISPLAY_NAME name]
[DESCRIPTION description] [HIDDEN | REQUIRED | DISABLED ]
[GROUP group] [DEPENDS comp1 comp2 ... ] [INSTALL_TYPES
type1 type2 ... ] [DOWNLOADED] [ARCHIVE_FILE filename])</p>

<p>The cmake_add_component command describes an
installation component, which the user can opt to install or
remove as part of the graphical installation process.
compname is the name of the component, as provided to the
COMPONENT argument of one or more CMake INSTALL
commands.</p>

<p>DISPLAY_NAME is the displayed name of the component,
used in graphical installers to display the component name.
This value can be any string.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION is an extended description of the component,
used in graphical installers to give the user additional
information about the component. Descriptions can span
multiple lines using &quot;0 as the line separator.
Typically, these descriptions should be no more than a few
lines long.</p>

<p>HIDDEN indicates that this component will be hidden in
the graphical installer, so that the user cannot directly
change whether it is installed or not.</p>

<p>REQUIRED indicates that this component is required, and
therefore will always be installed. It will be visible in
the graphical installer, but it cannot be unselected.
(Typically, required components are shown greyed out).</p>

<p>DISABLED indicates that this component should be
disabled (unselected) by default. The user is free to select
this component for installation, unless it is also
HIDDEN.</p>

<p>DEPENDS lists the components on which this component
depends. If this component is selected, then each of the
components listed must also be selected. The dependency
information is encoded within the installer itself, so that
users cannot install inconsitent sets of components.</p>

<p>GROUP names the component group of which this component
is a part. If not provided, the component will be a
standalone component, not part of any component group.
Component groups are described with the
cpack_add_component_group command, detailed below.</p>

<p>INSTALL_TYPES lists the installation types of which this
component is a part. When one of these installations types
is selected, this component will automatically be selected.
Installation types are described with the
cpack_add_install_type command, detailed below.</p>

<p>DOWNLOADED indicates that this component should be
downloaded on-the-fly by the installer, rather than packaged
in with the installer itself. For more information, see the
cpack_configure_downloads command.</p>

<p>ARCHIVE_FILE provides a name for the archive file
created by CPack to be used for downloaded components. If
not supplied, CPack will create a file with some name based
on CPACK_PACKAGE_FILE_NAME and the name of the component.
See cpack_configure_downloads for more information.</p>

<p>cpack_add_component_group - Describes a group of related
CPack installation components.</p>

<p>cpack_add_component_group(groupname [DISPLAY_NAME name]
[DESCRIPTION description] [PARENT_GROUP parent] [EXPANDED]
[BOLD_TITLE])</p>

<p>The cpack_add_component_group describes a group of
installation components, which will be placed together
within the listing of options. Typically, component groups
allow the user to select/deselect all of the components
within a single group via a single group-level option. Use
component groups to reduce the complexity of installers with
many options. groupname is an arbitrary name used to
identify the group in the GROUP argument of the
cpack_add_component command, which is used to place a
component in a group. The name of the group must not
conflict with the name of any component.</p>

<p>DISPLAY_NAME is the displayed name of the component
group, used in graphical installers to display the component
group name. This value can be any string.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION is an extended description of the component
group, used in graphical installers to give the user
additional information about the components within that
group. Descriptions can span multiple lines using &quot;0 as
the line separator. Typically, these descriptions should be
no more than a few lines long.</p>

<p>PARENT_GROUP, if supplied, names the parent group of
this group. Parent groups are used to establish a hierarchy
of groups, providing an arbitrary hierarchy of groups.</p>

<p>EXPANDED indicates that, by default, the group should
show up as &quot;expanded&quot;, so that the user
immediately sees all of the components within the group.
Otherwise, the group will initially show up as a single
entry.</p>

<p>BOLD_TITLE indicates that the group title should appear
in bold, to call the users attention to the group.</p>

<p>cpack_add_install_type - Add a new installation type
containing a set of predefined component selections to the
graphical installer.</p>

<p>cpack_add_install_type(typename [DISPLAY_NAME name])</p>

<p>The cpack_add_install_type command identifies a set of
preselected components that represents a common use case for
an application. For example, a &quot;Developer&quot; install
type might include an application along with its header and
library files, while an &quot;End user&quot; install type
might just include the applications executable. Each
component identifies itself with one or more install types
via the INSTALL_TYPES argument to cpack_add_component.</p>

<p>DISPLAY_NAME is the displayed name of the install type,
which will typically show up in a drop-down box within a
graphical installer. This value can be any string.</p>

<p>cpack_configure_downloads - Configure CPack to download
selected components on-the-fly as part of the installation
process.</p>

<p>cpack_configure_downloads(site [UPLOAD_DIRECTORY
dirname] [ALL] [ADD_REMOVE|NO_ADD_REMOVE])</p>

<p>The cpack_configure_downloads command configures
installation-time downloads of selected components. For each
downloadable component, CPack will create an archive
containing the contents of that component, which should be
uploaded to the given site. When the user selects that
component for installation, the installer will download and
extract the component in place. This feature is useful for
creating small installers that only download the requested
components, saving bandwidth. Additionally, the installers
are small enough that they will be installed as part of the
normal installation process, and the &quot;Change&quot;
button in Windows Add/Remove Programs control panel will
allow one to add or remove parts of the application after
the original installation. On Windows, the
downloaded-components functionality requires the ZipDLL
plug-in for NSIS, available at:</p>

<p>http://nsis.sourceforge.net/ZipDLL_plug-in</p>

<p>On Mac OS X, installers that download components
on-the-fly can only be built and installed on system using
Mac OS X 10.5 or later.</p>

<p>The site argument is a URL where the archives for
downloadable components will reside, e.g.,
http://www.cmake.org/files/2.6.1/installer/ All of the
archives produced by CPack should be uploaded to that
location.</p>

<p>UPLOAD_DIRECTORY is the local directory where CPack will
create the various archives for each of the components. The
contents of this directory should be uploaded to a location
accessible by the URL given in the site argument. If
omitted, CPack will use the directory CPackUploads inside
the CMake binary directory to store the generated
archives.</p>

<p>The ALL flag indicates that all components be
downloaded. Otherwise, only those components explicitly
marked as DOWNLOADED or that have a specified ARCHIVE_FILE
will be downloaded. Additionally, the ALL option implies
ADD_REMOVE (unless NO_ADD_REMOVE is specified).</p>

<p>ADD_REMOVE indicates that CPack should install a copy of
the installer that can be called from Windows Add/Remove
Programs dialog (via the &quot;Modify&quot; button) to
change the set of installed components. NO_ADD_REMOVE turns
off this behavior. This option is ignored on Mac OS X.</p>

<p>This file is the backwards-compatibility version of the
CTest module. It supports using the old Dart 1 Tcl client
for driving dashboard submissions as well as testing with
CTest. This mod- ule should be included in the
CMakeLists.txt file at the top of a project. Typical
usage:</p>

<p>INCLUDE(Dart) IF(BUILD_TESTING) # ... testing related
CMake code ... ENDIF(BUILD_TESTING)</p>

<p>The BUILD_TESTING option is created by the Dart module
to deter- mine whether testing support should be enabled.
The default is ON.</p>

<p>Documentation DocumentationVTK.cmake</p>

<p>This file provides support for the VTK documentation
framework. It relies on several tools (Doxygen, Perl,
etc).</p>

<p>FeatureSummary Macros for generating a summary of
enabled/disabled features</p>

<p>PRINT_ENABLED_FEATURES()</p>

<p>Print a summary of all enabled features. By default all
successfull FIND_PACKAGE() calls will appear here, except
the ones which used the QUIET keyword. Additional features
can be added by appending an entry to the global
ENABLED_FEATURES property. If SET_FEATURE_INFO() is used for
that feature, the output will be much more informative.</p>

<p>PRINT_DISABLED_FEATURES()</p>

<p>Same as PRINT_ENABLED_FEATURES(), but for disabled
features. It can be extended the same way by adding to the
global property DISABLED_FEATURES.</p>

<p>SET_FEATURE_INFO(NAME DESCRIPTION [URL [COMMENT] ] )</p>

<p>Use this macro to set up information about the named
feature, which will then be displayed by
PRINT_ENABLED/DISABLED_FEATURES(). Example:
SET_FEATURE_INFO(LibXml2 &quot;XML processing library.&quot;
&quot;http://xmlsoft.org/&quot;)</p>

<p>FindASPELL Try to find ASPELL</p>

<p>Once done this will define</p>

<p>ASPELL_FOUND - system has ASPELL ASPELL_INCLUDE_DIR -
the ASPELL include directory ASPELL_LIBRARIES - The
libraries needed to use ASPELL ASPELL_DEFINITIONS - Compiler
switches required for using ASPELL</p>

<p>FindAVIFile Locate AVIFILE library and include paths</p>

<p>AVIFILE (http://avifile.sourceforge.net/)is a set of
libraries for i386 machines to use various AVI codecs.
Support is limited beyond Linux. Windows provides native AVI
support, and so doesnt need this library. This module
defines</p>

<p>AVIFILE_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find avifile.h , etc.
AVIFILE_LIBRARIES, the libraries to link against
AVIFILE_DEFINITIONS, definitions to use when compiling
AVIFILE_FOUND, If false, dont try to use AVIFILE</p>

<p>FindBLAS Find BLAS library</p>

<p>This module finds an installed fortran library that
implements the BLAS linear-algebra interface (see
http://www.netlib.org/blas/). The list of libraries searched
for is taken from the autoconf macro file, acx_blas.m4
(distributed at
http://ac-archive.sourceforge.net/ac-archive/acx_blas.html).</p>

<p>FindBoost Try to find Boost include dirs and
libraries</p>

<p>Usage of this module as follows:</p>

<p>== Using Header-Only libraries from within Boost: ==</p>

<p>find_package( Boost 1.36.0 ) if(Boost_FOUND)
include_directories(${Boost_INCLUDE_DIRS})
add_executable(foo foo.cc) endif()</p>

<p>== Using actual libraries from within Boost: ==</p>

<p>set(Boost_USE_STATIC_LIBS ON)
set(Boost_USE_MULTITHREADED ON) find_package( Boost 1.36.0
COMPONENTS date_time filesystem system ... )</p>

<p>if(Boost_FOUND)
include_directories(${Boost_INCLUDE_DIRS})
add_executable(foo foo.cc) target_link_libraries(foo
${Boost_LIBRARIES}) endif()</p>

<p>The components list needs to contain actual names of
boost libraries only, such as &quot;date_time&quot; for
&quot;libboost_date_time&quot;. If youre using parts of
Boost that contain header files only (e.g. foreach) you do
not need to specify COMPONENTS.</p>

<p>You should provide a minimum version number that should
be used. If you provide this version number and specify the
REQUIRED attribute, this module will fail if it cant find
the specified or a later version. If you specify a version
number this is automatically put into the considered list of
version numbers and thus doesnt need to be specified in the
Boost_ADDI- TIONAL_VERSIONS variable (see below).</p>

<p>NOTE for Visual Studio Users:</p>

<p>Automatic linking is used on MSVC &amp; Borland
compilers by default when #including things in Boost. Its
important to note that setting Boost_USE_STATIC_LIBS to OFF
is NOT enough to get you dynamic linking, should you need
this feature. Automatic linking typically uses static
libraries with a few exceptions (Boost.Python is one).</p>

<p>Please see the section below near
Boost_LIB_DIAGNOSTIC_DEFINITIONS for more details. Adding a
TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES() as shown in the example above
appears to cause VS to link dynamically if
Boost_USE_STATIC_LIBS gets set to OFF. It is suggested you
avoid automatic linking since it will make your application
less portable.</p>

<p>=========== The mess that is Boost_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS
(sorry?) ============</p>

<p>OK, so the Boost_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS variable can be
used to specify a list of boost version numbers that should
be taken into account when searching for Boost.
Unfortunately boost puts the version number into the actual
filename for the libraries, so this variable will certainly
be needed in the future when new Boost versions are
released.</p>

<p>Currently this module searches for the following version
num- bers: 1.33, 1.33.0, 1.33.1, 1.34, 1.34.0, 1.34.1, 1.35,
1.35.0, 1.35.1, 1.36, 1.36.0, 1.36.1, 1.37, 1.37.0, 1.38,
1.38.0</p>

<p>NOTE: If you add a new major 1.x version in Boost_ADDI-
TIONAL_VERSIONS you should add both 1.x and 1.x.0 as shown
above. Official Boost include directories omit the 3rd
version number from include paths if it is 0 although not
all binary Boost releases do so.</p>

<p>SET(Boost_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS &quot;0.99&quot;
&quot;0.99.0&quot; &quot;1.78&quot; &quot;1.78.0&quot;)</p>


<p>============================================================================</p>

<p>Variables used by this module, they can change the
default behaviour and need to be set before calling
find_package:</p>

<p>Boost_USE_MULTITHREADED Can be set to OFF to use the
non-multithreaded boost libraries. If not specified,
defaults to ON.</p>

<p>Boost_USE_STATIC_LIBS Can be set to ON to force the use
of the static boost libraries. Defaults to OFF.</p>

<p>Other Variables used by this module which you may want
to set.</p>

<p>Boost_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS A list of version numbers to
use for searching the boost include directory. Please see
the documentation above regarding this annoying, but
necessary variable :(</p>

<p>Boost_DEBUG Set this to TRUE to enable debugging output
of FindBoost.cmake if you are having problems. Please enable
this before filing any bug reports.</p>

<p>Boost_COMPILER Set this to the compiler suffix used by
Boost (e.g. &quot;-gcc43&quot;) if FindBoost has problems
finding the proper Boost installation</p>

<p>These last three variables are available also as
environment variables:</p>

<p>BOOST_ROOT or BOOSTROOT The preferred installation
prefix for searching for Boost. Set this if the module has
problems finding the proper Boost installation.</p>

<p>BOOST_INCLUDEDIR Set this to the include directory of
Boost, if the module has problems finding the proper Boost
installation</p>

<p>BOOST_LIBRARYDIR Set this to the lib directory of Boost,
if the module has problems finding the proper Boost
installation</p>

<p>Variables defined by this module:</p>

<p>Boost_FOUND System has Boost, this means the include dir
was found, as well as all the libraries specified in the
COMPONENTS list.</p>

<p>Boost_INCLUDE_DIRS Boost include directories: not
cached</p>

<p>Boost_INCLUDE_DIR This is almost the same as above, but
this one is cached and may be modified by advanced users</p>

<p>Boost_LIBRARIES Link to these to use the Boost libraries
that you specified: not cached</p>

<p>Boost_LIBRARY_DIRS The path to where the Boost library
files are.</p>

<p>Boost_VERSION The version number of the boost libraries
that have been found, same as in version.hpp from Boost</p>

<p>Boost_LIB_VERSION The version number in filename form as
its appended to the library filenames</p>

<p>Boost_MAJOR_VERSION major version number of boost
Boost_MINOR_VERSION minor version number of boost
Boost_SUBMINOR_VERSION subminor version number of boost</p>

<p>Boost_LIB_DIAGNOSTIC_DEFINITIONS [WIN32 Only] You can
call add_definitions(${Boost_LIB_DIAGNOSTIC_DEFINTIIONS}) to
have diagnostic information about Boosts automatic linking
outputted during compilation time.</p>

<p>For each component you specify in find_package(), the
following (UPPER-CASE) variables are set. You can use these
variables if you would like to pick and choose components
for your targets instead of just using Boost_LIBRARIES.</p>

<p>Boost_${COMPONENT}_FOUND True IF the Boost library
&quot;component&quot; was found.</p>

<p>Boost_${COMPONENT}_LIBRARY Contains the libraries for
the specified Boost &quot;component&quot; (includes debug
and optimized keywords when needed).</p>

<p>FindLAPACK Find LAPACK library</p>

<p>This module finds an installed fortran library that
implements the LAPACK linear-algebra interface (see
http://www.netlib.org/lapack/).</p>

<p>The approach follows that taken for the autoconf macro
file, acx_lapack.m4 (distributed at
http://ac-archive.source-
forge.net/ac-archive/acx_lapack.html).</p>

<p>This module sets the following variables:</p>

<p>LAPACK_FOUND - set to true if a library implementing the
LAPACK interface is found LAPACK_LINKER_FLAGS - uncached
list of required linker flags (excluding -l and -L).
LAPACK_LIBRARIES - uncached list of libraries (using full
path name) to link against to use LAPACK LAPACK95_LIBRARIES
- uncached list of libraries (using full path name) to link
against to use LAPACK95 LAPACK95_FOUND - set to true if a
library implementing the LAPACK f95 interface is found
BLA_STATIC if set on this determines what kind of linkage we
do (static) BLA_VENDOR if set checks only the specified
vendor, if not set checks all the posibilities BLA_F95 if
set on tries to find the f95 interfaces for BLAS/LAPACK</p>

<p>## List of vendors (BLA_VENDOR) valid in this module #
Intel(mkl), ACML,Apple, NAS, Generic</p>

<p>FindMPI Message Passing Interface (MPI) module.</p>

<p>The Message Passing Interface (MPI) is a library used to
write high-performance parallel applications that use
message passing, and is typically deployed on a cluster. MPI
is a standard inter- face (defined by the MPI forum) for
which many implementations are available. All of these
implementations have somewhat dif- ferent compilation
approaches (different include paths, libraries to link
against, etc.), and this module tries to smooth out those
differences.</p>

<p>This module will set the following variables:</p>

<p>MPI_FOUND TRUE if we have found MPI MPI_COMPILE_FLAGS
Compilation flags for MPI programs MPI_INCLUDE_PATH Include
path(s) for MPI header MPI_LINK_FLAGS Linking flags for MPI
programs MPI_LIBRARY First MPI library to link against
(cached) MPI_EXTRA_LIBRARY Extra MPI libraries to link
against (cached) MPI_LIBRARIES All libraries to link MPI
programs against MPIEXEC Executable for running MPI programs
MPIEXEC_NUMPROC_FLAG Flag to pass to MPIEXEC before giving
it the number of processors to run on MPIEXEC_PREFLAGS Flags
to pass to MPIEXEC directly before the executable to run.
MPIEXEC_POSTFLAGS Flags to pass to MPIEXEC after all other
flags.</p>

<p>This module will attempt to auto-detect these settings,
first by looking for a MPI compiler, which many MPI
implementations pro- vide as a pass-through to the native
compiler to simplify the compilation of MPI programs. The
MPI compiler is stored in the cache variable MPI_COMPILER,
and will attempt to look for com- monly-named drivers
mpic++, mpicxx, mpiCC, or mpicc. If the com- piler driver is
found and recognized, it will be used to set all of the
module variables. To skip this auto-detection, set
MPI_LIBRARY and MPI_INCLUDE_PATH in the CMake cache.</p>

<p>If no compiler driver is found or the compiler driver is
not recognized, this module will then search for common
include paths and library names to try to detect MPI.</p>

<p>If CMake initially finds a different MPI than was
intended, and you want to use the MPI compiler
auto-detection for a different MPI implementation, set
MPI_COMPILER to the MPI compiler driver you want to use
(e.g., mpicxx) and then set MPI_LIBRARY to the string
MPI_LIBRARY-NOTFOUND. When you re-configure, auto-detec-
tion of MPI will run again with the newly-specified MPI_COM-
PILER.</p>

<p>When using MPIEXEC to execute MPI applications, you
should typi- cally use all of the MPIEXEC flags as
follows:</p>

<p>${MPIEXEC} ${MPIEXEC_NUMPROC_FLAG} PROCS
${MPIEXEC_PREFLAGS} EXECUTABLE ${MPIEXEC_POSTFLAGS} ARGS</p>

<p>where PROCS is the number of processors on which to
execute the program, EXECUTABLE is the MPI program, and ARGS
are the argu- ments to pass to the MPI program.</p>

<p>FindMatlab this module looks for Matlab</p>

<p>Defines:</p>

<p>MATLAB_INCLUDE_DIR: include path for mex.h, engine.h
MATLAB_LIBRARIES: required libraries: libmex, etc

People will have to change the cache values of
OPENGL_glu_LIBRARY and OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY to use OpenGL with
X11 on OSX</p>

<p>FindOpenMP Finds OpenMP support</p>

<p>This module can be used to detect OpenMP support in a
compiler. If the compiler supports OpenMP, the flags
required to compile with openmp support are set.</p>

<p>The following variables are set:</p>

<p>OpenMP_C_FLAGS - flags to add to the C compiler for
OpenMP support OpenMP_CXX_FLAGS - flags to add to the CXX
compiler for OpenMP support OPENMP_FOUND - true if openmp is
detected</p>

<p>Supported compilers can be found at
http://openmp.org/wp/openmp-compilers/</p>

<p>FindOpenSSL Try to find the OpenSSL encryption
library</p>

<p>Once done this will define</p>

<p>FindOpenSceneGraph Find OpenSceneGraph</p>

<p>This module searches for the OpenSceneGraph core
&quot;osg&quot; library as well as OpenThreads, and whatever
additional COMPONENTS that you specify.</p>

<p>See http://www.openscenegraph.org</p>

<p>NOTE: If you would like to use this module in your
CMAKE_MOD- ULE_PATH instead of requiring CMake &gt;= 2.6.3,
you will also need to download FindOpenThreads.cmake,
Findosg_functions.cmake, Fin- dosg.cmake, as well as files
for any Components you need to call (FindosgDB.cmake,
FindosgUtil.cmake, etc.)</p>

<p>This module accepts the following variables (note mixed
case)</p>

<p>OpenSceneGraph_DEBUG - Enable debugging output</p>

<p>OpenSceneGraph_MARK_AS_ADVANCED - Mark cache variables
as advanced automatically</p>

<p>The following environment variables are also respected
for find- ing the OSG and it s various components.
CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH can also be used for this (see
find_library() CMake documentation).</p>

<p>&lt;MODULE&gt;_DIR (where MODULE is of the form
&quot;OSGVOLUME&quot; and there is a FindosgVolume.cmake
file) OSG_DIR OSGDIR OSG_ROOT</p>

<p>This module defines the following output variables:</p>

<p>FindOpenThreads</p>

<p>OpenThreads is a C++ based threading library. Its
largest user- base seems to OpenSceneGraph so you might
notice I accept OSGDIR as an environment path. I consider
this part of the Find- osg* suite used to find
OpenSceneGraph components. Each compo- nent is separate and
you must opt in to each module.</p>

<p>Locate OpenThreads This module defines
OPENTHREADS_LIBRARY OPENTHREADS_FOUND, if false, do not try
to link to OpenThreads OPENTHREADS_INCLUDE_DIR, where to
find the headers</p>

<p>$OPENTHREADS_DIR is an environment variable that would
corre- spond to the ./configure --prefix=$OPENTHREADS_DIR
used in building osg.</p>

<p>Created by Eric Wing.</p>

<p>FindPHP4 Find PHP4</p>

<p>This module finds if PHP4 is installed and determines
where the include files and libraries are. It also
determines what the name of the library is. This code sets
the following variables:</p>

<p>PHP4_INCLUDE_PATH = path to where php.h can be found
PHP4_EXECUTABLE = full path to the php4 binary</p>

<p>FindPNG Find the native PNG includes and library</p>

<p>This module defines</p>

<p>PNG_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find png.h, etc.
PNG_LIBRARIES, the libraries to link against to use PNG.
PNG_DEFINITIONS - You should
ADD_DEFINITONS(${PNG_DEFINITIONS}) before compiling code
that includes png library files. PNG_FOUND, If false, do not
try to use PNG.</p>

<p>also defined, but not for general use are</p>

<p>PNG_LIBRARY, where to find the PNG library.</p>

<p>None of the above will be defined unles zlib can be
found. PNG depends on Zlib</p>

<p>FindPackageHandleStandardArgs</p>

<p>FIND_PACKAGE_HANDLE_STANDARD_ARGS(NAME
(DEFAULT_MSG|&quot;Custom failure message&quot;) VAR1 ...
)</p>

<p>This macro is intended to be used in FindXXX.cmake
modules files. It handles the REQUIRED and QUIET argument to
FIND_PACKAGE() and it also sets the
&lt;UPPERCASED_NAME&gt;_FOUND variable. The package is found
if all variables listed are TRUE. Example:</p>

<p>FIND_PACKAGE_HANDLE_STANDARD_ARGS(LibXml2 DEFAULT_MSG
LIBXML2_LIBRARIES LIBXML2_INCLUDE_DIR)</p>

<p>LibXml2 is considered to be found, if both
LIBXML2_LIBRARIES and LIBXML2_INCLUDE_DIR are valid. Then
also LIBXML2_FOUND is set to TRUE. If it is not found and
REQUIRED was used, it fails with FATAL_ERROR, independent
whether QUIET was used or not. If it is found, the location
is reported using the VAR1 argument, so here a message
&quot;Found LibXml2: /usr/lib/libxml2.so&quot; will be
printed out. If the second argument is DEFAULT_MSG, the
message in the failure case will be &quot;Could NOT find
LibXml2&quot;, if you don t like this message you can
specify your own custom failure message there.</p>

<p>FindPackageMessage</p>

<p>FIND_PACKAGE_MESSAGE(&lt;name&gt; &quot;message for
user&quot; &quot;find result details&quot;)</p>

<p>This macro is intended to be used in FindXXX.cmake
modules files. It will print a message once for each unique
find result. This is useful for telling the user where a
package was found. The first argument specifies the name
(XXX) of the package. The second argument specifies the
message to display. The third argument lists details about
the find result so that if they change the message will be
displayed again. The macro also obeys the QUIET argument to
the find_package command.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>IF(X11_FOUND) FIND_PACKAGE_MESSAGE(X11 &quot;Found X11:
${X11_X11_LIB}&quot;
&quot;[${X11_X11_LIB}][${X11_INCLUDE_DIR}]&quot;)
ELSE(X11_FOUND) ... ENDIF(X11_FOUND)</p>

<p>FindPerl Find perl</p>

<p>this module looks for Perl</p>

<p>PERL_EXECUTABLE - the full path to perl PERL_FOUND - If
false, dont attempt to use perl.</p>

<p>FindPerlLibs Find Perl libraries</p>

<p>This module finds if PERL is installed and determines
where the include files and libraries are. It also
determines what the name of the library is. This code sets
the following variables:</p>

<p>PERL_INCLUDE_PATH = path to where perl.h is found
PERL_EXECUTABLE = full path to the perl binary</p>

<p>FindPhysFS</p>

<p>Locate PhysFS library This module defines
PHYSFS_LIBRARY, the name of the library to link against
PHYSFS_FOUND, if false, do not try to link to PHYSFS
PHYSFS_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find physfs.h</p>

<p>$PHYSFSDIR is an environment variable that would
correspond to the ./configure --prefix=$PHYSFSDIR used in
building PHYSFS.</p>

<p>Created by Eric Wing.</p>

<p>FindPike Find Pike</p>

<p>This module finds if PIKE is installed and determines
where the include files and libraries are. It also
determines what the name of the library is. This code sets
the following variables:</p>

<p>PIKE_INCLUDE_PATH = path to where program.h is found
PIKE_EXECUTABLE = full path to the pike binary</p>

<p>FindPkgConfig a pkg-config module for CMake</p>

<p>Usage:</p>

<p>pkg_check_modules(&lt;PREFIX&gt; [REQUIRED]
&lt;MODULE&gt; [&lt;MODULE&gt;]*) checks for all the given
modules</p>

<p>pkg_search_module(&lt;PREFIX&gt; [REQUIRED]
&lt;MODULE&gt; [&lt;MODULE&gt;]*) checks for given modules
and uses the first working one</p>

<p>When the REQUIRED argument was set, macros will fail
with an error when module(s) could not be found</p>

<p>It sets the following variables:</p>

<p>PKG_CONFIG_FOUND ... true if pkg-config works on the
system PKG_CONFIG_EXECUTABLE ... pathname of the pkg-config
program &lt;PREFIX&gt;_FOUND ... set to 1 if module(s)
exist</p>

<p>For the following variables two sets of values exist;
first one is the common one and has the given PREFIX. The
second set con- tains flags which are given out when
pkgconfig was called with the --static option.</p>

<p>&lt;XPREFIX&gt;_LIBRARIES ... only the libraries (w/o
the -l) &lt;XPREFIX&gt;_LIBRARY_DIRS ... the paths of the
libraries (w/o the -L) &lt;XPREFIX&gt;_LDFLAGS ... all
required linker flags &lt;XPREFIX&gt;_LDFLAGS_OTHER ... all
other linker flags &lt;XPREFIX&gt;_INCLUDE_DIRS ... the -I
preprocessor flags (w/o the -I) &lt;XPREFIX&gt;_CFLAGS ...
all required cflags &lt;XPREFIX&gt;_CFLAGS_OTHER ... the
other compiler flags</p>

<p>&lt;XPREFIX&gt; = &lt;PREFIX&gt; for common case
&lt;XPREFIX&gt; = &lt;PREFIX&gt;_STATIC for static
linking</p>

<p>There are some special variables whose prefix depends on
the count of given modules. When there is only one module,
&lt;PREFIX&gt; stays unchanged. When there are multiple
modules, the prefix will be changed to
&lt;PREFIX&gt;_&lt;MODNAME&gt;:</p>

<p>&lt;XPREFIX&gt;_VERSION ... version of the module
&lt;XPREFIX&gt;_PREFIX ... prefix-directory of the module
&lt;XPREFIX&gt;_INCLUDEDIR ... include-dir of the module
&lt;XPREFIX&gt;_LIBDIR ... lib-dir of the module</p>

<p>&lt;XPREFIX&gt; = &lt;PREFIX&gt; when |MODULES| == 1,
else &lt;XPREFIX&gt; = &lt;PREFIX&gt;_&lt;MODNAME&gt;</p>

<p>A &lt;MODULE&gt; parameter can have the following
formats:</p>

<p>{MODNAME} ... matches any version
{MODNAME}&gt;={VERSION} ... at least version &lt;VERSION&gt;
is required {MODNAME}={VERSION} ... exactly version
&lt;VERSION&gt; is required {MODNAME}&lt;={VERSION} ...
modules must not be newer than &lt;VERSION&gt;</p>

<p>Examples</p>

<p>pkg_check_modules (GLIB2 glib-2.0)</p>

<p>pkg_check_modules (GLIB2 glib-2.0&gt;=2.10) requires at
least version 2.10 of glib2 and defines e.g.
GLIB2_VERSION=2.10.3</p>

<p>pkg_check_modules (FOO glib-2.0&gt;=2.10 gtk+-2.0)
requires both glib2 and gtk2, and defines e.g.
FOO_glib-2.0_VERSION=2.10.3 FOO_gtk+-2.0_VERSION=2.8.20</p>

<p>pkg_check_modules (XRENDER REQUIRED xrender) defines
e.g.: XRENDER_LIBRARIES=Xrender;X11
XRENDER_STATIC_LIBRARIES=Xrender;X11;pthread;Xau;Xdmcp</p>

<p>pkg_search_module (BAR libxml-2.0 libxml2
libxml&gt;=2)</p>

<p>FindProducer</p>

<p>Though Producer isn t directly part of OpenSceneGraph,
its pri- mary user is OSG so I consider this part of the
Findosg* suite used to find OpenSceneGraph components. You
ll notice that I accept OSGDIR as an environment path.</p>

<p>Each component is separate and you must opt in to each
module. You must also opt into OpenGL (and OpenThreads?) as
these mod- ules won t do it for you. This is to allow you
control over your own system piece by piece in case you need
to opt out of cer- tain components or change the Find
behavior for a particular module (perhaps because the
default FindOpenGL.cmake module doesnt work with your system
as an example). If you want to use a more convenient module
that includes everything, use the Find- OpenSceneGraph.cmake
instead of the Findosg*.cmake modules.</p>

<p>Locate Producer This module defines PRODUCER_LIBRARY
PRO- DUCER_FOUND, if false, do not try to link to Producer
PRO- DUCER_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find the headers</p>

<p>$PRODUCER_DIR is an environment variable that would
correspond to the ./configure --prefix=$PRODUCER_DIR used in
building osg.</p>

<p>Created by Eric Wing.</p>

<p>FindPythonInterp Find python interpreter</p>

<p>This module finds if Python interpreter is installed and
deter- mines where the executables are. This code sets the
following variables:</p>

<p>PYTHONINTERP_FOUND - Was the Python executable found
PYTHON_EXECUTABLE - path to the Python interpreter</p>

<p>FindPythonLibs Find python libraries</p>

<p>This module finds if Python is installed and determines
where the include files and libraries are. It also
determines what the name of the library is. This code sets
the following variables:</p>

<p>PYTHONLIBS_FOUND = have the Python libs been found
PYTHON_LIBRARIES = path to the python library
PYTHON_INCLUDE_PATH = path to where Python.h is found
PYTHON_DEBUG_LIBRARIES = path to the debug library</p>

<p>FindQt Searches for all installed versions of QT.</p>

<p>This should only be used if your project can work with
multiple versions of QT. If not, you should just directly
use FindQt4 or FindQt3. If multiple versions of QT are found
on the machine, then The user must set the option
DESIRED_QT_VERSION to the ver- sion they want to use. If
only one version of qt is found on the machine, then the
DESIRED_QT_VERSION is set to that version and the matching
FindQt3 or FindQt4 module is included. Once the user sets
DESIRED_QT_VERSION, then the FindQt3 or FindQt4 module is
included.</p>

<p>QT_REQUIRED if this is set to TRUE then if CMake can not
find QT4 or QT3 an error is raised and a message is sent to
the user.</p>

<p>DESIRED_QT_VERSION OPTION is created QT4_INSTALLED is
set to TRUE if qt4 is found. QT3_INSTALLED is set to TRUE if
qt3 is found.</p>

<p>FindQt3 Locate Qt include paths and libraries</p>

<p>This module defines:</p>

<p>QT_INCLUDE_DIR - where to find qt.h, etc. QT_LIBRARIES -
the libraries to link against to use Qt. QT_DEFINITIONS -
definitions to use when compiling code that uses Qt.
QT_FOUND - If false, dont try to use Qt.</p>

<p>If you need the multithreaded version of Qt, set
QT_MT_REQUIRED to TRUE</p>

<p>Also defined, but not for general use are:</p>

<p>QT_MOC_EXECUTABLE, where to find the moc tool.
QT_UIC_EXECUTABLE, where to find the uic tool.
QT_QT_LIBRARY, where to find the Qt library.
QT_QTMAIN_LIBRARY, where to find the qtmain library. This is
only required by Qt3 on Windows.</p>

<p>FindQt4 Find QT 4</p>

<p>This module can be used to find Qt4. The most important
issue is that the Qt4 qmake is available via the system
path. This qmake is then used to detect basically everything
else. This module defines a number of key variables and
macros. The variable QT_USE_FILE is set which is the path to
a CMake file that can be included to compile Qt 4
applications and libraries. It sets up the compilation
environment for include directories, prepro- cessor defines
and populates a QT_LIBRARIES variable.</p>

<p>Typical usage could be something like:</p>

<p>find_package(Qt4 4.4.3 COMPONENTS QtCore QtGui QtXml
REQUIRED ) include(${QT_USE_FILE}) add_executable(myexe
main.cpp) target_link_libraries(myexe ${QT_LIBRARIES})</p>

<p>When using the components argument, QT_USE_QT* variables
are automatically set for the QT_USE_FILE to pick up. If one
wishes to manually set them, the available ones to set
include:</p>

<p>QT_DONT_USE_QTCORE QT_DONT_USE_QTGUI QT_USE_QT3SUPPORT
QT_USE_QTASSISTANT QT_USE_QAXCONTAINER QT_USE_QAXSERVER

<p>There are also some files that need processing by some
Qt tools such as moc and uic. Listed below are macros that
may be used to process those files.</p>

<p>macro QT4_WRAP_CPP(outfiles inputfile ... OPTIONS ...)
create moc code from a list of files containing Qt class
with the Q_OBJECT declaration. Per-direcotry preprocessor
definitions are also added. Options may be given to moc,
such as those found when executing &quot;moc
-help&quot;.</p>

<p>macro QT4_WRAP_UI(outfiles inputfile ... OPTIONS ...)
create code from a list of Qt designer ui files. Options may
be given to uic, such as those found when executing
&quot;uic -help&quot;</p>

<p>macro QT4_ADD_RESOURCES(outfiles inputfile ... OPTIONS
...) create code from a list of Qt resource files. Options
may be given to rcc, such as those found when executing
&quot;rcc -help&quot;</p>

<p>macro QT4_GENERATE_MOC(inputfile outputfile ) creates a
rule to run moc on infile and create outfile. Use this if
for some reason QT4_WRAP_CPP() isnt appropriate, e.g.
because you need a custom filename for the moc file or
something similar.</p>

<p>macro QT4_AUTOMOC(sourcefile1 sourcefile2 ... ) This
macro is still experimental. It can be used to have moc
automatically handled. So if you have the files foo.h and
foo.cpp, and in foo.h a a class uses the Q_OBJECT macro, moc
has to run on it. If you dont want to use QT4_WRAP_CPP()
(which is reliable and mature), you can insert #include
&quot;foo.moc&quot; in foo.cpp and then give foo.cpp as
argument to QT4_AUTOMOC(). This will the scan all listed
files at cmake-time for such included moc files and if it
finds them cause a rule to be generated to run moc at build
time on the accompanying header file foo.h. If a source file
has the SKIP_AUTOMOC property set it will be ignored by this
macro.</p>

<p>macro QT4_ADD_DBUS_INTERFACE(outfiles interface
basename) create a the interface header and implementation
files with the given basename from the given interface xml
file and add it to the list of sources</p>

<p>macro QT4_ADD_DBUS_INTERFACES(outfiles inputfile ... )
create the interface header and implementation files for all
listed interface xml files the name will be automatically
determined from the name of the xml file</p>

<p>macro QT4_ADD_DBUS_ADAPTOR(outfiles xmlfile parentheader
parentclassname [basename] ) create a dbus adaptor (header
and implementation file) from the xml file describing the
interface, and add it to the list of sources. The adaptor
forwards the calls to a parent class, defined in
parentheader and named parentclassname. The name of the
generated files will be &lt;basename&gt;adaptor.{cpp,h}
where basename is the basename of the xml file.</p>

<p>macro QT4_GENERATE_DBUS_INTERFACE( header
[interfacename] ) generate the xml interface file from the
given header. If the optional argument interfacename is
omitted, the name of the interface file is constructed from
the basename of the header with the suffix .xml
appended.</p>

<p>macro QT4_CREATE_TRANSLATION( qm_files directories ...
sources ... ts_files ... OPTIONS ...) out: qm_files in:
directories sources ts_files options: flags to pass to
lupdate, such as -extensions to specify extensions for a
directory scan. generates commands to create .ts (vie
lupdate) and .qm (via lrelease) - files from directories
and/or sources. The ts files are created and/or updated in
the source tree (unless given with full paths). The qm files
are generated in the build tree. Updating the translations
can be done by adding the qm_files to the source list of
your library/executable, so they are always updated, or by
adding a custom target to control when they get
updated/generated.</p>

<p>macro QT4_ADD_TRANSLATION( qm_files ts_files ... ) out:
qm_files in: ts_files generates commands to create .qm from
.ts - files. The generated filenames can be found in
qm_files. The ts_files must exists and are not updated in
any way.</p>

<p>also defined, but NOT for general use are</p>

<p>QT_MOC_EXECUTABLE Where to find the moc tool.
QT_UIC_EXECUTABLE Where to find the uic tool.
QT_UIC3_EXECUTABLE Where to find the uic3 tool.
QT_RCC_EXECUTABLE Where to find the rcc tool
QT_DBUSCPP2XML_EXECUTABLE Where to find the qdbuscpp2xml
tool. QT_DBUSXML2CPP_EXECUTABLE Where to find the
qdbusxml2cpp tool. QT_LUPDATE_EXECUTABLE Where to find the
lupdate tool. QT_LRELEASE_EXECUTABLE Where to find the
lrelease tool.</p>

<p>These are around for backwards compatibility they will
be set</p>

<p>QT_WRAP_CPP Set true if QT_MOC_EXECUTABLE is found
QT_WRAP_UI Set true if QT_UIC_EXECUTABLE is found</p>

<p>These variables do _NOT_ have any effect anymore
(compared to FindQt.cmake)</p>

<p>QT_MT_REQUIRED Qt4 is now always multithreaded</p>

<p>These variables are set to &quot;&quot; Because Qt
structure changed (They make no sense in Qt4)</p>

<p>QT_QT_LIBRARY Qt-Library is now split</p>

<p>FindQuickTime</p>

<p>Locate QuickTime This module defines QUICKTIME_LIBRARY
QUICK- TIME_FOUND, if false, do not try to link to gdal
QUICK- TIME_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find the headers</p>

<p>$QUICKTIME_DIR is an environment variable that would
correspond to the ./configure --prefix=$QUICKTIME_DIR</p>

<p>Created by Eric Wing.</p>

<p>FindRTI Try to find M&amp;S HLA RTI libraries</p>

<p>This module finds if any HLA RTI is installed and
locates the standard RTI include files and libraries.</p>

<p>RTI is a simulation infrastructure standartized by IEEE
and SISO. It has a well defined C++ API that assures that
simulation applications are independent on a particular RTI
implementation.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-Time_Infrastructure_(simula-
tion)</p>

<p>This code sets the following variables:</p>

<p>RTI_INCLUDE_DIR = the directory where RTI includes file
are found RTI_LIBRARIES = The libraries to link against to
use RTI RTI_DEFINITIONS = -DRTI_USES_STD_FSTREAM RTI_FOUND =
Set to FALSE if any HLA RTI was not found</p>

<p>Report problems to &lt;certi-devel@nongnu.org&gt;</p>

<p>FindRuby Find Ruby</p>

<p>This module finds if Ruby is installed and determines
where the include files and libraries are. It also
determines what the name of the library is. This code sets
the following variables:</p>

<p>RUBY_INCLUDE_PATH = path to where ruby.h can be found
RUBY_EXECUTABLE = full path to the ruby binary RUBY_LIBRARY
= full path to the ruby library</p>

<p>FindSDL</p>

<p>Locate SDL library This module defines SDL_LIBRARY, the
name of the library to link against SDL_FOUND, if false, do
not try to link to SDL SDL_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find
SDL.h</p>

<p>This module responds to the the flag:
SDL_BUILDING_LIBRARY If this is defined, then no SDL_main
will be linked in because only applications need main().
Otherwise, it is assumed you are building an application and
this module will attempt to locate and set the the proper
link flags as part of the returned SDL_LIBRARY variable.</p>

<p>Dont forget to include SDLmain.h and SDLmain.m your
project for the OS X framework based version. (Other
versions link to -lSDLmain which this module will try to
find on your behalf.) Also for OS X, this module will
automatically add the -frame- work Cocoa on your behalf.</p>

<p>Additional Note: If you see an empty SDL_LIBRARY_TEMP in
your configuration and no SDL_LIBRARY, it means CMake did
not find your SDL library (SDL.dll, libsdl.so,
SDL.framework, etc). Set SDL_LIBRARY_TEMP to point to your
SDL library, and configure again. Similarly, if you see an
empty SDLMAIN_LIBRARY, you should set this value as
appropriate. These values are used to generate the final
SDL_LIBRARY variable, but when these values are unset,
SDL_LIBRARY does not get created.</p>

<p>$SDLDIR is an environment variable that would correspond
to the ./configure --prefix=$SDLDIR used in building SDL.
l.e.galup 9-20-02</p>

<p>Modified by Eric Wing. Added code to assist with
automated building by using environmental variables and
providing a more controlled/consistent search behavior.
Added new modifications to recognize OS X frameworks and
additional Unix paths (FreeBSD, etc). Also corrected the
header search path to follow &quot;proper&quot; SDL
guidelines. Added a search for SDLmain which is needed by
some platforms. Added a search for threads which is needed
by some platforms. Added needed compile switches for
MinGW.</p>

<p>On OSX, this will prefer the Framework version (if
found) over others. People will have to manually change the
cache values of SDL_LIBRARY to override this selection or
set the CMake environ- ment CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH to modify the
search paths.</p>

<p>Note that the header path has changed from SDL/SDL.h to
just SDL.h This needed to change because &quot;proper&quot;
SDL convention is #include &quot;SDL.h&quot;, not
&lt;SDL/SDL.h&gt;. This is done for portability reasons
because not all systems place things in SDL/ (see
FreeBSD).</p>

<p>FindSDL_image</p>

<p>Locate SDL_image library This module defines
SDLIMAGE_LIBRARY, the name of the library to link against
SDLIMAGE_FOUND, if false, do not try to link to SDL
SDLIMAGE_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find SDL/SDL.h</p>

<p>$SDLDIR is an environment variable that would correspond
to the ./configure --prefix=$SDLDIR used in building
SDL.</p>

FindSDL.cmake module, but with modifications to recognize OS
X frameworks and additional Unix paths (FreeBSD, etc).</p>

<p>FindSDL_mixer</p>

<p>Locate SDL_mixer library This module defines
SDLMIXER_LIBRARY, the name of the library to link against
SDLMIXER_FOUND, if false, do not try to link to SDL
SDLMIXER_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find SDL/SDL.h</p>

<p>$SDLDIR is an environment variable that would correspond
to the ./configure --prefix=$SDLDIR used in building
SDL.</p>

<p>Locates the SDL_sound library</p>

<p>FindSDL_ttf</p>

<p>Locate SDL_ttf library This module defines
SDLTTF_LIBRARY, the name of the library to link against
SDLTTF_FOUND, if false, do not try to link to SDL
SDLTTF_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find SDL/SDL.h</p>

<p>$SDLDIR is an environment variable that would correspond

SDL.</p>

<p>Created by Eric Wing. This was influenced by the
FindSDL.cmake module, but with modifications to recognize OS

<p>FindSWIG Find SWIG</p>

<p>This module finds an installed SWIG. It sets the
following variables:</p>

<p>SWIG_FOUND - set to true if SWIG is found SWIG_DIR - the
directory where swig is installed SWIG_EXECUTABLE - the path
to the swig executable SWIG_VERSION - the version number of
the swig executable</p>

<p>All informations are collected from the SWIG_EXECUTABLE
so the version to be found can be changed from the command
line by means of setting SWIG_EXECUTABLE</p>

<p>FindSelfPackers Find upx</p>

<p>This module looks for some executable packers (i.e.
softwares that compress executables or shared libs into
on-the-fly self-extracting executables or shared libs.

<p>FindSubversion Extract information from a subversion
working copy</p>

<p>The module defines the following variables:</p>

<p>Subversion_SVN_EXECUTABLE - path to svn command line
client Subversion_VERSION_SVN - version of svn command line
client Subversion_FOUND - true if the command line client
was found</p>

<p>If the command line client executable is found the
macro</p>

<p>Subversion_WC_INFO(&lt;dir&gt; &lt;var-prefix&gt;)</p>

<p>is defined to extract information of a subversion
working copy at a given location. The macro defines the
following variables:</p>

ENDIF(Subversion_FOUND)</p>

<p>FindTCL TK_INTERNAL_PATH was removed.</p>

<p>This module finds if Tcl is installed and determines
where the include files and libraries are. It also
determines what the name of the library is. This code sets
the following variables:</p>

<p>TCL_FOUND = Tcl was found TK_FOUND = Tk was found
TCLTK_FOUND = Tcl and Tk were found TCL_LIBRARY = path to
Tcl library (tcl tcl80) TCL_INCLUDE_PATH = path to where
tcl.h can be found TCL_TCLSH = path to tclsh binary (tcl
tcl80) TK_LIBRARY = path to Tk library (tk tk80 etc)
TK_INCLUDE_PATH = path to where tk.h can be found TK_WISH =
full path to the wish executable</p>

<p>In an effort to remove some clutter and clear up some
issues for people who are not necessarily Tcl/Tk
gurus/developpers, some variables were moved or removed.
Changes compared to CMake 2.4 are:</p>

<p>=&gt; they were only useful for people writing Tcl/Tk
extensions. =&gt; these libs are not packaged by default
with Tcl/Tk distributions. Even when Tcl/Tk is built from
source, several flavors of debug libs are created and there
is no real reason to pick a single one specifically (say,
amongst tcl84g, tcl84gs, or tcl84sgx). Let s leave that
choice to the user by allowing him to assign TCL_LIBRARY to
any Tcl library, debug or not. =&gt; this ended up being
only a Win32 variable, and there is a lot of confusion
regarding the location of this file in an installed Tcl/Tk
tree anyway (see 8.5 for example). If you need the internal
path at this point it is safer you ask directly where the
*source* tree is and dig from there.</p>

<p>FindTIFF Find TIFF library</p>

<p>Find the native TIFF includes and library This module
defines</p>

<p>TIFF_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find tiff.h, etc.

<p>also defined, but not for general use are</p>

<p>TIFF_LIBRARY, where to find the TIFF library.</p>

<p>FindTclStub TCL_STUB_LIBRARY_DEBUG and
TK_STUB_LIBRARY_DEBUG were removed.</p>

<p>This module finds Tcl stub libraries. It first finds Tcl
include files and libraries by calling FindTCL.cmake. How to
Use the Tcl Stubs Library:</p>

determines what the name of the library is. This code sets
the following variables:</p>

<p>TCLSH_FOUND = TRUE if tclsh has been found TCL_TCLSH =
the path to the tclsh executable</p>

<p>In cygwin, look for the cygwin version first. Dont look
for it later to avoid finding the cygwin version on a Win32
build.</p>

<p>FindThreads This module determines the thread library of
the system.</p>

<p>The following variables are set</p>

<p>CMAKE_THREAD_LIBS_INIT - the thread library
CMAKE_USE_SPROC_INIT - are we using sproc?
CMAKE_USE_WIN32_THREADS_INIT - using WIN32 threads?
CMAKE_USE_PTHREADS_INIT - are we using pthreads
CMAKE_HP_PTHREADS_INIT - are we using hp pthreads</p>

<p>FindUnixCommands Find unix commands from cygwin</p>

<p>This module looks for some usual Unix commands.</p>

<p>FindVTK Find a VTK installation or build tree.</p>

<p>The following variables are set if VTK is found. If VTK
is not found, VTK_FOUND is set to false.</p>

<p>VTK_FOUND - Set to true when VTK is found. VTK_USE_FILE
- CMake file to use VTK. VTK_MAJOR_VERSION - The VTK major
version number. VTK_MINOR_VERSION - The VTK minor version
number (odd non-release). VTK_BUILD_VERSION - The VTK patch

locate VTK:</p>

<p>VTK_DIR - The directory containing VTKConfig.cmake. This
is either the root of the build tree, or the lib/vtk
directory. This is the only cache entry.</p>

<p>The following variables are set for backward
compatibility and should not be used in new code:</p>

<p>USE_VTK_FILE - The full path to the UseVTK.cmake file.
This is provided for backward compatibility. Use
VTK_USE_FILE instead.</p>

<p>FindWget Find wget</p>

<p>This module looks for wget. This module defines the
following values:</p>

<p>WGET_EXECUTABLE: the full path to the wget tool.
WGET_FOUND: True if wget has been found.</p>

<p>FindWish Find wish installation</p>

<p>This module finds if TCL is installed and determines
where the include files and libraries are. It also
determines what the name of the library is. This code sets
the following variables:</p>

<p>TK_WISH = the path to the wish executable</p>

<p>if UNIX is defined, then it will look for the cygwin
version first</p>

<p>NOTE: It is highly recommended that you use the new
FindOpen- SceneGraph.cmake introduced in CMake 2.6.3 and not
use this Find module directly.</p>

<p>This is part of the Findosg* suite used to find
OpenSceneGraph components. Each component is separate and
you must opt in to each module. You must also opt into
OpenGL and OpenThreads (and Producer if needed) as these
modules wont do it for you. This is to allow you control
over your own system piece by piece in case you need to opt
out of certain components or change the Find behavior for a
particular module (perhaps because the default
FindOpenGL.cmake module doesn t work with your system as an
example). If you want to use a more convenient module that
includes everything, use the FindOpenSceneGraph.cmake

<p>This CMake file contains two macros to assist with
searching for OSG libraries and nodekits.</p>

<p>FindwxWidgets Find a wxWidgets (a.k.a., wxWindows)
installation.</p>

<p>This module finds if wxWidgets is installed and selects
a default configuration to use. wxWidgets is a modular
library. To specify the modules that you will use, you need
to name them as components to the package:</p>

<p>FIND_PACKAGE(wxWidgets COMPONENTS base core ...)</p>

<p>There are two search branches: a windows style and a
unix style. For windows, the following variables are
searched for and set to defaults in case of multiple
choices. Change them if the defaults are not desired (i.e.,
these are the only variables you should change to select a
configuration):</p>

<p>wxWidgets_ROOT_DIR - Base wxWidgets directory (e.g.,
C:/wxWidgets-2.6.3). wxWidgets_LIB_DIR - Path to wxWidgets
libraries (e.g., C:/wxWidgets-2.6.3/lib/vc_lib).
wxWidgets_CONFIGURATION - Configuration to use (e.g., msw,
mswd, mswu, mswunivud, etc.)</p>

<p>For unix style it uses the wx-config utility. You can
select between debug/release, unicode/ansi,
universal/non-universal, and static/shared in the QtDialog
or ccmake interfaces by turn- ing ON/OFF the following
variables:</p>

<p>wxWidgets_USE_DEBUG wxWidgets_USE_UNICODE
wxWidgets_USE_UNIVERSAL wxWidgets_USE_STATIC</p>

<p>The following are set after the configuration is done
for both windows and unix style:</p>

<p>wxWidgets_FOUND - Set to TRUE if wxWidgets was found.
wxWidgets_INCLUDE_DIRS - Include directories for WIN32 i.e.,
where to find &quot;wx/wx.h&quot; and
&quot;wx/setup.h&quot;; possibly empty for unices.
wxWidgets_LIBRARIES - Path to the wxWidgets libraries.
wxWidgets_LIBRARY_DIRS - compile time link dirs, useful for
rpath on UNIX. Typically an empty string in WIN32
environment. wxWidgets_DEFINITIONS - Contains defines
required to compile/link against WX, e.g. -DWXUSINGDLL
wxWidgets_CXX_FLAGS - Include dirs and ompiler flags for
unices, empty on WIN32. Esentially &quot; wx-config
--cxxflags&quot;. wxWidgets_USE_FILE - Convenience include
file.</p>

<p>Sample usage:</p>

<p>FIND_PACKAGE(wxWidgets COMPONENTS base core gl net)
IF(wxWidgets_FOUND) INCLUDE(${wxWidgets_USE_FILE}) # and for
each of your dependant executable/library targets:
TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(&lt;YourTarget&gt;
${wxWidgets_LIBRARIES}) ENDIF(wxWidgets_FOUND)</p>

<p>If wxWidgets is required (i.e., not an optional
part):</p>

<p>FIND_PACKAGE(wxWidgets REQUIRED base core gl net)
INCLUDE(${wxWidgets_USE_FILE}) # and for each of your
dependant executable/library targets:
TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(&lt;YourTarget&gt;
${wxWidgets_LIBRARIES})</p>

<p>FindwxWindows Find wxWindows (wxWidgets)
installation</p>

<p>This module finds if wxWindows/wxWidgets is installed
and deter- mines where the include files and libraries are.
It also deter- mines what the name of the library is. Please
note this file is DEPRECATED and replaced by
FindwxWidgets.cmake. This code sets the following
variables:</p>

<p>WXWINDOWS_FOUND = system has WxWindows
WXWINDOWS_LIBRARIES = path to the wxWindows libraries on
Unix/Linux with additional linker flags from &quot;wx-config
--libs&quot; CMAKE_WXWINDOWS_CXX_FLAGS = Compiler flags for
wxWindows, essentially &quot; wx-config --cxxflags&quot; on
Linux WXWINDOWS_INCLUDE_DIR = where to find
&quot;wx/wx.h&quot; and &quot;wx/setup.h&quot;
WXWINDOWS_LINK_DIRECTORIES = link directories, useful for
rpath on Unix WXWINDOWS_DEFINITIONS = extra defines</p>

<p>OPTIONS If you need OpenGL support please</p>

<p>SET(WXWINDOWS_USE_GL 1)</p>

<p>in your CMakeLists.txt *before* you include this
file.</p>

<p>HAVE_ISYSTEM - true required to replace -I by -isystem

<p>FortranCInterface</p>

<p>FortranCInterface.cmake</p>

<p>This file defines the function
create_fortran_c_interface. this function is used to create
a configured header file that con- tains a mapping from C to
a Fortran function using the correct name mangling scheme as
defined by the current fortran com- piler.</p>

<p>The function tages a list of functions and the name of a
header file to configure.</p>

<p>This file also defines some helper functions that are
used to detect the fortran name mangling scheme used by the
current Fortran compiler.</p>

<p>test_fortran_mangling - test a single fortran mangling
discover_fortran_mangling - loop over all combos of fortran
name mangling and call test_fortran_mangling until one of
them works. discover_fortran_module_mangling - try different
types of fortran modle name mangling to find one that
works</p>

<p>this function tests a single fortran mangling. CODE -
test code to try should define a subroutine called
&quot;sub&quot; PREFIX - string to put in front of sub
POSTFIX - string to put after sub ISUPPER - if TRUE then sub
will be called as SUB DOC - string used in status checking
Fortran ${DOC} linkage SUB - the name of the SUB to call
RESULT place to store result TRUE if this link- age works,
FALSE</p>

<p>if not.</p>

<p>GetPrerequisites</p>

<p>GetPrerequisites.cmake</p>

<p>This script provides functions to list the .dll, .dylib
or .so files that an executable or shared library file
depends on. (Its prerequisites.)</p>

<p>It uses various tools to obtain the list of required
shared library files:</p>

<p>dumpbin (Windows) ldd (Linux/Unix) otool (Mac OSX)</p>

<p>The following functions are provided by this script:</p>

<p>gp_append_unique gp_file_type is_file_executable
gp_item_default_embedded_path (projects can override with
gp_item_default_embedded_path_override) gp_resolve_item
(projects can override with gp_resolve_item_override)
get_prerequisites list_prerequisites
list_prerequisites_by_glob</p>

<p>Requires CMake 2.6 or greater because it uses function,
break, return and PARENT_SCOPE.</p>

<p>ITKCompatibility</p>

<p>work around an old bug in ITK prior to verison 3.0</p>

<p>InstallRequiredSystemLibraries</p>

<p>By including this file, all files in the
CMAKE_INSTALL_DEBUG_LIBRARIES, will be installed with
INSTALL_PROGRAMS into /bin for WIN32 and /lib for non-win32.
If CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_RULES is set to TRUE before including
this file, then the INSTALL command is not called. The use
can use the variable CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_LIBS to
use a custom install command and install them into any
directory they want. If it is the MSVC compiler, then the
microsoft run time libraries will be found add automatically
added to the CMAKE_INSTALL_DEBUG_LIBRARIES, and installed.
If CMAKE_INSTALL_DEBUG_LIBRARIES is set and it is the MSVC
com- piler, then the debug libraries are installed when
available. If CMAKE_INSTALL_MFC_LIBRARIES is set then the
MFC run time libraries are installed as well as the CRT run
time libraries.</p>

<p>This script launches a GUI test using Squish. You should
not call the script directly; instead, you should acces it
via the SQUISH_ADD_TEST macro that is defined in
FindSquish.cmake.</p>

<p>This script starts the Squish server, launches the test
on the client, and finally stops the squish server. If any
of these steps fail (including if the tests do not pass)
then a fatal error is raised.</p>

<p>UseEcos This module defines variables and macros
required to build eCos application.</p>

<p>This file contains the following macros:
ECOS_ADD_INCLUDE_DIREC- TORIES() - add the eCos include dirs
ECOS_ADD_EXECUTABLE(name source1 ... sourceN ) - create an
eCos executable ECOS_ADJUST_DIRECTORY(VAR source1 ...
sourceN ) - adjusts the path of the source files and puts
the result into VAR</p>

<p>Macros for selecting the toolchain:
ECOS_USE_ARM_ELF_TOOLS() - enable the ARM ELF toolchain for
the directory where it is called ECOS_USE_I386_ELF_TOOLS() -
enable the i386 ELF toolchain for the directory where it is
called ECOS_USE_PPC_EABI_TOOLS() - enable the PowerPC
toolchain for the directory where it is called</p>

<p>It contains the following variables: ECOS_DEFINITIONS
ECOSCON- FIG_EXECUTABLE ECOS_CONFIG_FILE - defaults to
ecos.ecc, if your eCos configuration file has a different
name, adjust this variable for internal use only:</p>

<p>ECOS_ADD_TARGET_LIB</p>

<p>UsePkgConfig obsolete pkg-config module for CMake</p>

<p>Defines the following macros:</p>

<p>PKGCONFIG(package includedir libdir linkflags
cflags)</p>

<p>Calling PKGCONFIG will fill the desired information into
the 4 given arguments, e.g. PKGCONFIG(libart-2.0
LIBART_INCLUDE_DIR LIBART_LINK_DIR LIBART_LINK_FLAGS
LIBART_CFLAGS) if pkg-config was NOT found or the specified
software package doesnt exist, the variable will be empty
when the function returns, otherwise they will contain the
respective information</p>

<p>UseQt4 Use Module for QT4</p>

<p>Sets up C and C++ to use Qt 4. It is assumed that
FindQt.cmake has already been loaded. See FindQt.cmake for
information on how to load Qt 4 into your CMake project.</p>

<p>UseSWIG SWIG module for CMake</p>

<p>Defines the following macros:</p>

<p>SWIG_ADD_MODULE(name language [ files ]) - Define swig
module with given name and specified language
SWIG_LINK_LIBRARIES(name [ libraries ]) - Link libraries to
swig module</p>

<p>All other macros are for internal use only. To get the
actual name of the swig module, use:
${SWIG_MODULE_name_REAL_NAME}. Set Source files properties
such as CPLUSPLUS and SWIG_FLAGS to specify special behavior
of SWIG. Also global CMAKE_SWIG_FLAGS can be used to add
special flags to all swig calls. Another spe- cial variable
is CMAKE_SWIG_OUTDIR, it allows one to specify where to
write all the swig generated module (swig -outdir option)
The name-specific variable
SWIG_MODULE_&lt;name&gt;_EXTRA_DEPS may be used to specify
extra dependencies for the generated mod- ules.</p>

<p>cmake_install</p>

<p>Install script for directory: /build-
dir/build/BUILD/cmake-2.6.4/Modules</p>

<p>VARIABLES VARIABLES THAT CHANGE BEHAVIOR
BUILD_SHARED_LIBS Global flag to cause add_library to create
shared libraries if on.</p>

<p>If present and true, this will cause all libraries to be
built shared unless the library was explicitly added as a
static library. This variable is often added to projects as
an OPTION so that each user of a project can decide if they
want to build the project using shared or static
libraries.</p>

<p>CMAKE_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY Version of cmake required
to build project</p>

<p>From the point of view of backwards compatibility, this
speci- fies what version of CMake should be supported. By
default this value is the version number of CMake that you
are running. You can set this to an older version of CMake
to support deprecated commands of CMake in projects that
were written to use older versions of CMake. This can be set
by the user or set at the beginning of a CMakeLists
file.</p>

<p>CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE Specifies the build type for make based
generators.</p>

<p>This specifies what build type will be built in this
tree. Pos- sible values are empty, Debug, Release,
RelWithDebInfo and Min- SizeRel. This variable is only
supported for make based genera- tors. If this variable is
supported, then CMake will also pro- vide initial values for
the variables with the name
CMAKE_C_FLAGS_[Debug|Release|RelWithDebInfo|MinSizeRel]. For
example, if CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE is Debug, then
CMAKE_C_FLAGS_DEBUG will be added to the CMAKE_C_FLAGS.</p>

<p>CMAKE_COLOR_MAKEFILE Enables color output when using the
Makefile generator.</p>

<p>When enabled, the generated Makefiles will produce
colored out- put. Default is ON.</p>

<p>CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES Specifies the available build
types.</p>

<p>This specifies what build types will be available such
as Debug, Release, RelWithDebInfo etc. This has reasonable
defaults on most platforms. But can be extended to provide
other build types. See also CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE.</p>

<p>CMAKE_FIND_LIBRARY_PREFIXES Prefixes to prepend when
looking for libraries.</p>

<p>This specifies what prefixes to add to library names
when the find_library command looks for libraries. On UNIX
systems this is typically lib, meaning that when trying to
find the foo library it will look for libfoo.</p>

<p>CMAKE_FIND_LIBRARY_SUFFIXES Suffixes to append when
looking for libraries.</p>

<p>This specifies what suffixes to add to library names
when the find_library command looks for libraries. On
Windows systems this is typically .lib and .dll, meaning
that when trying to find the foo library it will look for
foo.dll etc.</p>

<p>CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH Path used for searching by
FIND_FILE() and FIND_PATH().</p>

<p>Specifies a path which will be used both by FIND_FILE()
and FIND_PATH(). Both commands will check each of the
contained directories for the existence of the file which is
currently searched. By default it is empty, it is intended
to be set by the project. See also
CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH, CMAKE_PRE- FIX_PATH.</p>

<p>CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX Install directory used by
install.</p>

<p>If &quot;make install&quot; is invoked or INSTALL is
built, this directory is pre-pended onto all install
directories. This variable defaults to /usr/local on UNIX
and c:/Program Files on Windows.</p>

<p>CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH Path used for searching by
FIND_LIBRARY().</p>

<p>Specifies a path which will be used by FIND_LIBRARY().
FIND_LIBRARY() will check each of the contained directories
for the existence of the library which is currently
searched. By default it is empty, it is intended to be set
by the project. See also CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH,
CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH.</p>

<p>CMAKE_MFC_FLAG Tell cmake to use MFC for an executable
or dll.</p>

<p>This can be set in a CMakeLists.txt file and will enable
MFC in the application. It should be set to 1 for static the
static MFC library, and 2 for the shared MFC library. This
is used in visual studio 6 and 7 project files. The
CMakeSetup dialog uses MFC and the CMakeLists.txt looks like
this:</p>

<p>ADD_DEFINITIONS(-D_AFXDLL)</p>

<p>set(CMAKE_MFC_FLAG 2)</p>

<p>add_executable(CMakeSetup WIN32 ${SRCS})</p>

<p>CMAKE_MODULE_PATH Path to look for cmake modules to
load.</p>

<p>Specifies a path to override the default seach path for
CMake modules. For example include commands will look in
this path first for modules to include.</p>

<p>CMAKE_NOT_USING_CONFIG_FLAGS Skip _BUILD_TYPE flags if
true.</p>

<p>This is an internal flag used by the generators in CMake
to tell CMake to skip the _BUILD_TYPE flags.</p>

<p>CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH Path used for searching by FIND_XXX(),
with appropriate suffixes added.</p>

<p>Specifies a path which will be used by the FIND_XXX()
commands. It contains the &quot;base&quot; directories, the
FIND_XXX() commands append appropriate subdirectories to the
base directories. So FIND_PROGRAM() adds /bin to each of the
directories in the path, FIND_LIBRARY() appends /lib to each
of the directories, and FIND_PATH() and FIND_FILE() append
/include . By default it is empty, it is intended to be set
by the project. See also CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH,
CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH, CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH,
CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH.</p>

<p>CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH Path used for searching by
FIND_PROGRAM().</p>

<p>Specifies a path which will be used by FIND_PROGRAM().
FIND_PRO- GRAM() will check each of the contained
directories for the existence of the program which is
currently searched. By default it is empty, it is intended
to be set by the project. See also
CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROGRAM_PATH, CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH.</p>

<p>CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH Path used for searching by
FIND_FILE() and FIND_PATH().</p>

<p>Specifies a path which will be used both by FIND_FILE()
and FIND_PATH(). Both commands will check each of the
contained directories for the existence of the file which is
currently searched. By default it contains the standard
directories for the current system. It is NOT intended to be
modified by the project, use CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH for this.
See also CMAKE_SYS- TEM_PREFIX_PATH.</p>

<p>CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH Path used for searching by
FIND_LIBRARY().</p>

<p>Specifies a path which will be used by FIND_LIBRARY().
FIND_LIBRARY() will check each of the contained directories
for the existence of the library which is currently
searched. By default it contains the standard directories
for the current system. It is NOT intended to be modified by
the project, use CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH for this. See
also CMAKE_SYSTEM_PRE- FIX_PATH.</p>

<p>CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH Path used for searching by
FIND_XXX(), with appropriate suffixes added.</p>

<p>Specifies a path which will be used by the FIND_XXX()
commands. It contains the &quot;base&quot; directories, the
FIND_XXX() commands append appropriate subdirectories to the
base directories. So FIND_PROGRAM() adds /bin to each of the
directories in the path, FIND_LIBRARY() appends /lib to each
of the directories, and FIND_PATH() and FIND_FILE() append
/include . By default this contains the standard directories
for the current system. It is NOT intended to be modified by
the project, use CMAKE_PRE- FIX_PATH for this. See also
CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH, CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH,
CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROGRAM_PATH.</p>

<p>CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROGRAM_PATH Path used for searching by
FIND_PROGRAM().</p>

<p>Specifies a path which will be used by FIND_PROGRAM().
FIND_PRO- GRAM() will check each of the contained
directories for the existence of the program which is
currently searched. By default it contains the standard
directories for the current system. It is NOT intended to be
modified by the project, use CMAKE_PRO- GRAM_PATH for this.
See also CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH.</p>

<p>CMAKE_USER_MAKE_RULES_OVERRIDE Specify a file that can
change the build rule variables.</p>

<p>If this variable is set, it should to point to a
CMakeLists.txt file that will be read in by CMake after all
the system settings have been set, but before they have been
used. This would allow you to override any variables that
need to be changed for some special project.</p>

<p>VARIABLES THAT DESCRIBE THE SYSTEM APPLE True if running
on Mac OSX.</p>

<p>Set to true on Mac OSX.</p>

<p>BORLAND True of the borland compiler is being used.</p>

<p>This is set to true if the Borland compiler is being
used.</p>

systems.</p>

<p>Set to true when the host system is Apple OSX.</p>

<p>CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM Name of system cmake is being run
on.</p>

<p>The same as CMAKE_SYSTEM but for the host system instead
of the target system when cross compiling.</p>

<p>CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_NAME Name of the OS CMake is running
on.</p>

<p>The same as CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME but for the host system
instead of the target system when cross compiling.</p>

<p>CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR The name of the CPU CMake is
running on.</p>

<p>CMAKE_HOST_WIN32 True on windows systems, including
win64.</p>

<p>Set to true when the host system is Windows and on
cygwin.</p>

<p>CMAKE_OBJECT_PATH_MAX Maximum object file full-path
length allowed by native build tools.</p>

<p>CMake computes for every source file an object file name
that is unique to the source file and deterministic with
respect to the full path to the source file. This allows
multiple source files in a target to share the same name if
they lie in different directories without rebuilding when
one is added or removed. However, it can produce long full
paths in a few cases, so CMake shortens the path using a
hashing scheme when the full path to an object file exceeds
a limit. CMake has a built-in limit for each platform that
is sufficient for common tools, but some native tools may
have a lower limit. This variable may be set to specify the
limit explicitly. The value must be an integer no less than
128.</p>

<p>CMAKE_SYSTEM Name of system cmake is compiling for.</p>

<p>This variable is the composite of CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAMEand
CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION, like this ${CMAKE_SYS-
TEM_NAME}-${CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION}. If CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION
is not set, then CMAKE_SYSTEM is the same as
CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME.</p>

<p>CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME Name of the OS CMake is building
for.</p>

<p>This is the name of the operating system on which CMake
is tar- geting. On systems that have the uname command, this
variable is set to the output of uname -s. Linux, Windows,
and Darwin for Mac OSX are the values found on the big three
operating systems.</p>

<p>CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR The name of the CPU CMake is
building for.</p>

<p>On systems that support uname, this variable is set to
the out- put of uname -p, on windows it is set to the value
of the envi- ronment variable PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE</p>

<p>CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION OS version CMake is building
for.</p>

<p>A numeric version string for the system, on systems that
support uname, this variable is set to the output of uname
-r. On other systems this is set to major-minor version
numbers.</p>

<p>CYGWIN True for cygwin.</p>

<p>Set to true when using CYGWIN.</p>

<p>MSVC True when using Microsoft Visual C</p>

<p>Set to true when the compiler is some version of
Microsoft Visual C.</p>

<p>Set to true when the compiler is version 8.0 of
Microsoft Visual C.</p>

<p>MSVC_IDE True when using the Microsoft Visual C IDE</p>

<p>Set to true when the target platform is the Microsoft
Visual C IDE, as opposed to the command line compiler.</p>

For example 1300 is MSVC 6.0.</p>

<p>UNIX True for UNIX and UNIX like operating systems.</p>

<p>Set to true when the target system is UNIX or UNIX like
(i.e. APPLE and CYGWIN).</p>

<p>WIN32 True on windows systems, including win64.</p>

project for a given language but are not compiled.</p>

<p>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_IMPLICIT_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES
Directories implicitly searched by the compiler for header
files.</p>

<p>CMake does not explicitly specify these directories on
compiler command lines for language &lt;LANG&gt;. This
prevents system include directories from being treated as
user include directories on some compilers.</p>

<p>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINKER_PREFERENCE Determine if a
language should be used for linking.</p>

<p>If this is &quot;Preferred&quot; then if there is a

<p>This is used in determining the compiler ABI and is
subject to change.</p>

<p>CMAKE_USER_MAKE_RULES_OVERRIDE_&lt;LANG&gt; Specify a
file that can change the build rule variables.</p>

<p>If this variable is set, it should to point to a
CMakeLists.txt file that will be read in by CMake after all
the system settings have been set, but before they have been
used. This would allow you to override any variables that
need to be changed for some language.</p>

<p>VARIABLES THAT CONTROL THE BUILD
CMAKE_&lt;CONFIG&gt;_POSTFIX Default filename postfix for
libraries under configuration &lt;CON- FIG&gt;.</p>

<p>When a non-executable target is created its
&lt;CONFIG&gt;_POSTFIX target property is initialized with
the value of this variable if it is set.</p>

<p>CMAKE_ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY Where to put all the
ARCHIVE targets when built.</p>

<p>This variable is used to initialize the
ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY property on all the targets. See
that target property for addi- tional information.</p>

<p>CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH Use the install path for
the RPATH</p>

<p>Normally CMake uses the build tree for the RPATH when
building executables etc on systems that use RPATH. When the
software is installed the executables etc are relinked by
CMake to have the install RPATH. If this variable is set to
true then the software is always built with the install path
for the RPATH and does not need to be relinked when
installed.</p>

<p>CMAKE_DEBUG_POSTFIX See variable
CMAKE_&lt;CONFIG&gt;_POSTFIX.</p>

<p>This variable is a special case of the more-general
CMAKE_&lt;CON- FIG&gt;_POSTFIX variable for the DEBUG
configuration.</p>

executables.</p>

<p>Flags used by the linker when creating an
executable.</p>

<p>CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS_[CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE] Flag used when
linking an executable.</p>

<p>Same as CMAKE_C_FLAGS_* but used by the linker when
creating executables.</p>

<p>CMAKE_Fortran_MODULE_DIRECTORY Fortran module output
directory.</p>

<p>This variable is used to initialize the
Fortran_MODULE_DIRECTORY property on all the targets. See
that target property for addi- tional information.</p>

<p>CMAKE_INSTALL_NAME_DIR Mac OSX directory name for
installed targets.</p>

<p>CMAKE_INSTALL_NAME_DIR is used to initialize the
INSTALL_NAME_DIR property on all targets. See that target
prop- erty for more information.</p>

<p>CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH The rpath to use for installed
targets.</p>

<p>A semicolon-separated list specifying the rpath to use
in installed targets (for platforms that support it). This
is used to initialize the target property INSTALL_RPATH for
all targets.</p>

<p>CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH Add paths to linker
search and installed rpath.</p>

<p>CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH is a boolean that if
set to true will append directories in the linker search
path and out- side the project to the INSTALL_RPATH. This is
used to initial- ize the target property
INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH for all tar- gets.</p>

<p>CMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY Where to put all the
LIBRARY targets when built.</p>

<p>This variable is used to initialize the
LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY property on all the targets. See
that target property for addi- tional information.</p>

<p>CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH_FLAG The flag used to add a library
search path to a compiler.</p>

<p>The flag used to specify a library directory to the
compiler. On most compilers this is &quot;-L&quot;.</p>

.def file for dll creation.</p>

<p>The flag used to add a .def file when creating a dll on
Windows, this is only defined on Windows.</p>

<p>CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARY_FILE_FLAG Flag used to link a library
specified by a path to its file.</p>

<p>The flag used before a library file path is given to the
linker. This is needed only on very few platforms.</p>

executable. On most compilers this is &quot;-l&quot;.</p>

<p>CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY Where to put all the
RUNTIME targets when built.</p>

<p>This variable is used to initialize the
RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY property on all the targets. See
that target property for additional information.</p>

<p>CMAKE_SKIP_BUILD_RPATH Do not include RPATHs in the
build tree.</p>

<p>Normally CMake uses the build tree for the RPATH when
building executables etc on systems that use RPATH. When the
software is installed the executables etc are relinked by
CMake to have the install RPATH. If this variable is set to
true then the software is always built with no RPATH.</p>

<p>CMAKE_USE_RELATIVE_PATHS Use relative paths (May not
work!).</p>

<p>If this is set to TRUE, then the CMake will use relative
paths between the source and binary tree. This option does
not work for more complicated projects, and relative paths
are used when possible. In general, it is not possible to
move CMake gener- ated makefiles to a different location
regardless of the value of this variable.</p>

<p>EXECUTABLE_OUTPUT_PATH Old executable location
variable.</p>

<p>The target property RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY supercedes
this variable for a target if it is set. Executable targets
are oth- erwise placed in this directory.</p>

<p>LIBRARY_OUTPUT_PATH Old library location variable.</p>

<p>The target properties ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY,
LIBRARY_OUT- PUT_DIRECTORY, and RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
supercede this vari- able for a target if they are set.
Library targets are other- wise placed in this
directory.</p>

<p>VARIABLES THAT PROVIDE INFORMATION CMAKE_AR Name of
archiving tool for static libraries.</p>

<p>This specifies name of the program that creates archive
or static libraries.</p>

<p>CMAKE_BINARY_DIR The path to the top level of the build
tree.</p>

<p>This is the full path to the top level of the current
CMake build tree. For an in-source build, this would be the
same as CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR.</p>

<p>CMAKE_BUILD_TOOL Tool used for the acutal build
process.</p>

<p>This variable is set to the program that will be needed
to build the output of CMake. If the generator selected was
Visual Stu- dio 6, the CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM will be set to
msdev, for Unix makefiles it will be set to make or gmake,
and for Visual Studio 7 it set to devenv. For Nmake
Makefiles the value is nmake. This can be useful for adding
special flags and commands based on the final build
environment.</p>

<p>CMAKE_CACHEFILE_DIR The directory with the
CMakeCache.txt file.</p>

<p>This is the full path to the directory that has the
CMake- Cache.txt file in it. This is the same as
CMAKE_BINARY_DIR.</p>

<p>CMAKE_CACHE_MAJOR_VERSION Major version of CMake used to
create the CMakeCache.txt file</p>

<p>This is stores the major version of CMake used to write
a CMake cache file. It is only different when a different
version of CMake is run on a previously created cache
file.</p>

<p>CMAKE_CACHE_MINOR_VERSION Minor version of CMake used to
create the CMakeCache.txt file</p>

<p>This is stores the minor version of CMake used to write
a CMake cache file. It is only different when a different
version of CMake is run on a previously created cache
file.</p>

<p>CMAKE_CACHE_RELEASE_VERSION Release version of CMake
used to create the CMakeCache.txt file</p>

<p>This is stores the release version of CMake used to
write a CMake cache file. It is only different when a
different version of CMake is run on a previously created
cache file.</p>

<p>CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR Build time configuration directory for
project.</p>

<p>This is a variable that is used to provide developers
access to the intermediate directory used by Visual Studio
IDE projects. For example, if building Debug all executables
and libraries end up in a Debug directory. On UNIX systems
this variable is set to &quot;.&quot;. However, with Visual
Studio this variable is set to $(IntDir). $(IntDir) is
expanded by the IDE only. So this variable should only be
used in custom commands that will be run during the build
process. This variable should not be used directly in a
CMake command. CMake has no way of knowing if Debug or
Release will be picked by the IDE for a build type. If a
program needs to know the directory it was built in, it can
use CMAKE_INTDIR. CMAKE_INTDIR is a C/C++ preprocessor macro
that is defined on the command line of the compiler. If it
has a value, it will be the intermediate directory used to
build the file. This way an executable or a library can find
files that are located in the build directory.</p>

<p>CMAKE_COMMAND The full path to the cmake executable.</p>

<p>This is the full path to the CMake executable cmake
which is useful from custom commands that want to use the

with cmake.</p>

<p>This is the full path to the CTest executable ctest
which is useful from custom commands that want to use the
cmake -E option for portable system commands.</p>

<p>CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR The path to the binary
directory currently being processed.</p>

<p>This the full path to the build directory that is
currently being processed by cmake. Each directory added by
add_subdirec- tory will create a binary directory in the
build tree, and as it is being processed this variable will
be set. For in-source builds this is the current source
directory being processed.</p>

<p>CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_FILE Full path to the listfile
currently being processed.</p>

<p>As CMake processes the listfiles in your project this
