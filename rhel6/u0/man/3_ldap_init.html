<p>LDAP_OPEN(3) LDAP_OPEN(3)</p>

<p>NAME ldap_init, ldap_initialize, ldap_open - Initialize
the LDAP library and open a connection to an LDAP server</p>

<p>LIBRARY OpenLDAP LDAP (libldap, -lldap)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;ldap.h&gt;</p>

<p>LDAP *ldap_open(host, port) char *host; int port;</p>

<p>LDAP *ldap_init(host, port) char *host; int port;</p>

<p>int ldap_initialize(ldp, uri) LDAP **ldp; char *uri;</p>

<p>#include &lt;ldap_pvt.h&gt;</p>

<p>int ldap_init_fd(fd, proto, uri, ldp) ber_socket_t fd;
int proto; char *uri; LDAP **ldp;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION ldap_open() opens a connection to an LDAP
server and allocates an LDAP structure which is used to
identify the connection and to maintain per- connection
information. ldap_init() allocates an LDAP structure but
does not open an initial connection. ldap_initialize()
allocates an LDAP structure but does not open an initial
connection. ldap_init_fd() allocates an LDAP structure using
an existing connection on the pro- vided socket. One of
these routines must be called before any opera- tions are
attempted.</p>

<p>ldap_open() takes host, the hostname on which the LDAP
server is run- ning, and port, the port number to which to
connect. If the default IANA-assigned port of 389 is
desired, LDAP_PORT should be specified for port. The host
parameter may contain a blank-separated list of hosts to try
to connect to, and each host may optionally by of the form
host:port. If present, the :port overrides the port
parameter to ldap_open(). Upon successfully making a
connection to an LDAP server, ldap_open() returns a pointer
to an opaque LDAP structure, which should be passed to
subsequent calls to ldap_bind(), ldap_search(), etc. Cer-
tain fields in the LDAP structure can be set to indicate
size limit, time limit, and how aliases are handled during
operations; read and write access to those fields must occur
by calling ldap_get_option(3) and ldap_set_option(3)
respectively, whenever possible.</p>

<p>ldap_init() acts just like ldap_open(), but does not
open a connection to the LDAP server. The actual connection
open will occur when the first operation is attempted.</p>

<p>ldap_initialize() acts like ldap_init(), but it returns
an integer indicating either success or the failure reason,
and it allows to spec- ify details for the connection in the
schema portion of the URI. The uri parameter may be a comma-
or whitespace-separated list of URIs containing only the
schema, the host, and the port fields. Apart from ldap,
other (non-standard) recognized values of the schema field
are ldaps (LDAP over TLS), ldapi (LDAP over IPC), and cldap
(connectionless LDAP). If other fields are present, the
behavior is undefined.</p>

<p>At this time, ldap_open() and ldap_init() are deprecated
in favor of ldap_initialize(), essentially because the
latter allows to specify a schema in the URI and it
explicitly returns an error code.</p>

<p>ldap_init_fd() allows an LDAP structure to be
initialized using an already-opened connection. The proto
parameter should be one of LDAP_PROTO_TCP, LDAP_PROTO_UDP,
or LDAP_PROTO_IPC for a connection using TCP, UDP, or IPC,
respectively. The value LDAP_PROTO_EXT may also be specified
if user-supplied sockbuf handlers are going to be used. Note
that support for UDP is not implemented unless libldap was
built with LDAP_CONNECTIONLESS defined. The uri parameter
may optionally be provided for informational purposes.</p>

<p>Note: the first call into the LDAP library also
initializes the global options for the library. As such the
first call should be single- threaded or otherwise protected
to insure that only one call is active. It is recommended
that ldap_get_option() or ldap_set_option() be used in the
programs main thread before any additional threads are
created. See ldap_get_option(3).</p>

<p>ERRORS If an error occurs, ldap_open() and ldap_init()
will return NULL and errno should be set appropriately.
ldap_initialize() and ldap_init_fd() will directly return
the LDAP code associated to the error (or LDAP_SUCCESS in
case of success); errno should be set as well whenever
appropriate.</p>
