<p>SG_LUNS(8) SG3_UTILS SG_LUNS(8)</p>

<p>NAME sg_luns - send the SCSI REPORT LUNS command</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sg_luns [--decode] [--help] [--hex]
[--maxlen=LEN] [--quiet] [--raw] [--select=SR] [--verbose]
[--version] DEVICE</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Send the SCSI REPORT LUNS command to the
DEVICE and outputs the response. In the SPC-3 SCSI standard
support for this command is manda- tory.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Arguments to long options are mandatory for
short options as well.</p>

<p>-d, --decode decode logical unit numbers into their
hierarchical parts. Interprets luns as described in SAM-3
when the HiSup bit is set in a standard INQUIRYs
response.</p>

<p>-h, --help output the usage message then exit.</p>

<p>-H, --hex output response to this command in ASCII
hex.</p>

<p>-m, --maxlen=LEN where LEN is the (maximum) response
length in bytes. It is placed in the cdbs &quot;allocation
length&quot; field. If not given (or LEN is zero) then 8192
is used. The maximum allowed value of LEN is 65536.</p>

<p>-q, --quiet output ASCII hex rendering of each report
lun, one per line.</p>

<p>-r, --raw output response in binary (to stdout).</p>

<p>-s, --select=SR this option sets the select report field
(SR) in the SCSI REPORT LUNS command. The default value is
0. When 0 is given (or this option is not specified) then
the DEVICE should yield a list of luns addressable via this
&quot;I_T nexus&quot; that use the fol- lowing lun
addressing methods: logical unit addressing, periph- eral
device addressing and flat space addressing. When 1 is given
the DEVICE should yield a list of only &quot;well
known&quot; logi- cal units addressable via this
&quot;I_T&quot; nexus. When 2 is given the DEVICE should
yield all luns addressable via this &quot;I_T&quot; nexus.
To simplify, for the I_T nexus associated with the DEVICE,
the meanings of the SR values are: 0 : all luns excluding
well known logical units 1 : well known logical units 2 :
all luns Values greater than 2 are reserved (at SPC-4 (rev
8)).</p>

<p>-v, --verbose increase the level of verbosity, (i.e.
debug output).</p>

<p>-V, --version print the version string and then
exit.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The exit status of sg_luns is 0 when it is
successful. Otherwise see the sg3_utils(8) man page.</p>
