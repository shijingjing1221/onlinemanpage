<p>STRUCT I2C_BOARD_INF(9) I2C and SMBus Subsystem STRUCT
I2C_BOARD_INF(9)</p>

<p>NAME struct_i2c_board_info - template for device
creation</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS struct i2c_board_info { char
type[I2C_NAME_SIZE]; unsigned short flags; unsigned short
addr; void * platform_data; struct dev_archdata * archdata;
int irq; };</p>

<p>MEMBERS type[I2C_NAME_SIZE] chip type, to initialize
i2c_client.name</p>

<p>flags to initialize i2c_client.flags</p>

<p>addr stored in i2c_client.addr</p>

<p>platform_data stored in i2c_client.dev.platform_data</p>

<p>archdata copied into i2c_client.dev.archdata</p>

<p>irq stored in i2c_client.irq</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION I2C doesn&acute;t actually support hardware
probing, although controllers and devices may be able to use
I2C_SMBUS_QUICK to tell whether or not there&acute;s a
device at a given address. Drivers commonly need more
information than that, such as chip type, configuration,
associated IRQ, and so on.</p>

<p>i2c_board_info is used to build tables of information
listing I2C devices that are present. This information is
used to grow the driver model tree. For mainboards this is
done statically using i2c_register_board_info; bus numbers
identify adapters that aren&acute;t yet available. For
add-on boards, i2c_new_device does this dynamically with the
adapter already known.</p>
