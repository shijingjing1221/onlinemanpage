<p>IRQBALANCE(1) irqbalance IRQBALANCE(1)</p>

<p>NAME irqbalance - distribute hardware interrupts across
processors on a mul- tiprocessor system</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS irqbalance</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The purpose of irqbalance is distribute
hardware interrupts across pro- cessors on a multiprocessor
system in order to increase performance.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --oneshot Causes irqbalance to be run once,
after which the daemon exits</p>

<p>--debug Causes irqbalance to run in the foreground and
extra debug information to be printed</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES IRQBALANCE_ONESHOT Same as
--oneshot</p>

<p>IRQBALANCE_DEBUG Same as --debug</p>

<p>IRQBALANCE_BANNED_CPUS Provides a mask of cpus which
irqbalance should ignore and never assign interrupts to</p>

<p>NOTES The purpose of irqbalance is to distribute
interrupts accross cpus in an smp system such that
cache-domain affinity is maximized for each irq. In other
words, irqbalance tries to assign irqs to cpu cores such
that each irq stands a greater chance of having its
interrupt handler be in cache when the irq is asserted to
the cpu. This raises a few interesting cases in which the
behavior of irqbalance may be non-intu- itive. Most notably,
cases in which a system has only one cache domain. Nominally
these systems are only single cpu environments, but can also
be found in multi-core environments in which the cores share
an L2 cache. In these situations irqbalance will exit
immediately, since there is no work that irqbalance can do
which will improve inter- rupt handling performance. This is
normal and not cause for concern. For more information
