<p>SYSLINUX(1) SYSLINUX(1)</p>

<p>NAME syslinux - install the SYSLINUX bootloader on a FAT
filesystem</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS syslinux [-sfr] [-d directory] [-o offset]
device</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Syslinux is a boot loader for the Linux
operating system which operates off an MS-DOS/Windows FAT
filesystem. It is intended to simplify first- time
installation of Linux, and for creation of rescue and other
spe- cial-purpose boot disks.</p>

<p>In order to create a bootable Linux floppy using
Syslinux, prepare a normal MS-DOS formatted floppy. Copy one
or more Linux kernel files to it, then execute the
command:</p>

<p>syslinux /dev/fd0</p>

<p>This will alter the boot sector on the disk and copy a
file named LDLINUX.SYS into its root directory.</p>

<p>On boot time, by default, the kernel will be loaded from
the image named LINUX on the boot floppy. This default can
be changed, see the section on the syslinux configuration
file.</p>

<p>If the Shift or Alt keys are held down during boot, or
the Caps or Scroll locks are set, syslinux will display a
lilo(8) -style &quot;boot:&quot; prompt. The user can then
type a kernel file name followed by any ker- nel parameters.
The syslinux loader does not need to know about the kernel
file in advance; all that is required is that it is a file
located in the root directory on the disk.</p>

<p>Syslinux supports the loading of initial ramdisks
(initrd) and the bzImage kernel format.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -s Install a &quot;safe, slow and stupid&quot;
version of syslinux. This ver- sion may work on some very
buggy BIOSes on which syslinux would otherwise fail. If you
find a machine on which the -s option is required to make it
boot reliably, please send as much info about your machine
as you can, and include the failure mode.</p>

<p>-f Force install even if it appears unsafe.</p>

<p>-r RAID mode. If boot fails, tell the BIOS to boot the
next device in the boot sequence (usually the next hard
disk) instead of stopping with an error message. This is
useful for RAID-1 boot- ing.</p>

<p>-d subdirectory Install the SYSLINUX control files in a
subdirectory with the specified name (relative to the root
directory on the device).</p>

<p>-o offset Indicates that the filesystem is at an offset
from the base of the device or file.</p>

<p>FILES Configuration file All the configurable defaults
in syslinux can be changed by putting a file called
syslinux.cfg in the root directory of the boot floppy. This
is a text file in either UNIX or DOS format, containing one
or more of the following items (case is insensitive for
keywords).</p>

<p>In the configuration file blank lines and comment lines
beginning with a hash mark (#) are ignored.</p>

<p>default kernel [ options ... ] Sets the default command
line. If syslinux boots automatically, it will act just as
if the entries after &quot;default&quot; had been typed in
at the &quot;boot:&quot; prompt.</p>

<p>If no configuration file is present, or no
&quot;default&quot; entry is present in the configuration
file, the default is &quot;linux auto&quot;.</p>

<p>NOTE: Earlier versions of SYSLINUX used to automatically
append the string &quot;auto&quot; to whatever the user
specified using the DEFAULT command. As of version 1.54,
this is no longer true, as it caused problems when using a
shell as a substitute for &quot;init.&quot; You may want to
include this option manually.</p>

<p>append options ... Add one or more options to the kernel
command line. These are added both for automatic and manual
boots. The options are added at the very beginning of the
kernel command line, usually per- mitting explicitly entered
kernel options to override them. This is the equivalent of
the lilo(8) &quot;append&quot; option.</p>

<p>label label kernel image append options ... Indicates
that if label is entered as the kernel to boot, sys- linux
should instead boot image, and the specified
&quot;append&quot; options should be used instead of the
ones specified in the global section of the file (before the
first &quot;label&quot; command.) The default for image is
the same as label, and if no &quot;append&quot; is given the
default is to use the global entry (if any). Use
&quot;append -&quot; to use no options at all. Up to 128
&quot;label&quot; entries are permitted.</p>

<p>Notes: Labels are mangled as if they were DOS filenames,
and must be unique after mangling. For example, two labels
&quot;v2.1.30&quot; and &quot;v2.1.31&quot; will not be
distinguishable.</p>

<p>The &quot;image&quot; doesn t have to be a Linux kernel;
it can be a boot sector or a COMBOOT file (see below.)</p>

<p>implicit flag_val If flag_val is 0, do not load a kernel
image unless it has been explicitly named in a
&quot;label&quot; statement. The default is 1.</p>

<p>timeout timeout Indicates how long to wait at the
&quot;boot:&quot; prompt until booting automatically, in
units of 1/10 s. The timeout is cancelled as soon as the
user types anything on the keyboard, the assumption being
that the user will complete the command line already begun.
A timeout of zero will disable the timeout completely, this
is also the default. The maximum possible timeout value is
35996; corresponding to just below one hour.</p>

<p>serial port [ baudrate ] Enables a serial port to act as
the console. &quot;port&quot; is a number (0 = /dev/ttyS0 =
COM1, etc.); if &quot;baudrate&quot; is omitted, the baud
rate defaults to 9600 bps. The serial parameters are hard-
coded to be 8 bits, no parity, 1 stop bit.</p>

<p>For this directive to be guaranteed to work properly, it
should be the first directive in the configuration file.</p>

<p>font filename Load a font in .psf format before
displaying any output (except the copyright line, which is
output as ldlinux.sys itself is loaded.) syslinux only loads
the font onto the video card; if the .psf file contains a
Unicode table it is ignored. This only works on EGA and VGA
cards; hopefully it should do nothing on others.</p>

<p>kbdmap keymap Install a simple keyboard map. The
keyboard remapper used is very simplistic (it simply remaps
the keycodes received from the BIOS, which means that only
the key combinations relevant in the default layout -
usually U.S. English - can be mapped) but should at least
help people with AZERTY keyboard layout and the locations of
= and , (two special characters used heavily on the Linux
kernel command line.)</p>

<p>The included program keytab-lilo.pl(8) from the lilo(8)
distribution can be used to create such keymaps.</p>

<p>display filename Displays the indicated file on the
screen at boot time (before the boot: prompt, if displayed).
Please see the section below on DISPLAY files. If the file
is missing, this option is simply ignored.</p>

<p>prompt flag_val If flag_val is 0, display the
&quot;boot:&quot; prompt only if the Shift or Alt key is
pressed, or Caps Lock or Scroll lock is set (this is the
default). If flag_val is 1, always display the
&quot;boot:&quot; prompt.</p>

<p>f1 filename f2 filename ... f9 filename f10 filename f11
filename f12 filename Displays the indicated file on the
screen when a function key is pressed at the
&quot;boot:&quot; prompt. This can be used to implement
pre-boot online help (presumably for the kernel command line
options.)</p>

<p>When using the serial console, press
&lt;Ctrl-F&gt;&lt;digit&gt; to get to the help screens, e.g.
&lt;Ctrl-F&gt;2 to get to the f2 screen. For f10-f12, hit
&lt;Ctrl-F&gt;A, &lt;Ctrl-F&gt;B, &lt;Ctrl-F&gt;C. For
compatiblity with earlier versions, f10 can also be entered
as &lt;Ctrl-F&gt;0.</p>

<p>Display file format DISPLAY and function-key help files
are text files in either DOS or UNIX format (with or without
&lt;CR&gt;). In addition, the following special codes are
interpreted:</p>

<p>&lt;FF&gt; = &lt;Ctrl-L&gt; = ASCII 12 Clear the screen,
home the cursor. Note that the screen is filled with the
current display color.</p>

<p>&lt;SI&gt;&lt;bg&gt;&lt;fg&gt;, &lt;SI&gt; =
&lt;Ctrl-O&gt; = ASCII 15 Set the display colors to the
specified background and fore- ground colors, where
&lt;bg&gt; and &lt;fg&gt; are hex digits, corresponding to
the standard PC display attributes:</p>

<p>0 = black 8 = dark grey 1 = dark blue 9 = bright blue 2
= dark green a = bright green 3 = dark cyan b = bright cyan
4 = dark red c = bright red 5 = dark purple d = bright
purple 6 = brown e = yellow 7 = light grey f = white</p>

<p>Picking a bright color (8-f) for the background results
in the corresponding dark color (0-7), with the foreground
flashing.</p>

<p>colors are not visible over the serial console.</p>

<p>&lt;CAN&gt;filename&lt;newline&gt;, &lt;CAN&gt; =
&lt;Ctrl-X&gt; = ASCII 24 If a VGA display is present, enter
graphics mode and display the graphic included in the
specified file. The file format is an ad hoc format called
LSS16; the included Perl program &quot;ppm- tolss16&quot;
can be used to produce these images. This Perl program also
includes the file format specification.</p>

<p>The image is displayed in 640x480 16-color mode. Once in
graph- ics mode, the display attributes (set by &lt;SI&gt;
code sequences) work slightly differently: the background
color is ignored, and the foreground colors are the 16
colors specified in the image file. For that reason,
ppmtolss16 allows you to specify that certain colors should
be assigned to specific color indicies.</p>

<p>Color indicies 0 and 7, in particular, should be chosen
with care: 0 is the background color, and 7 is the color
used for the text printed by SYSLINUX itself.</p>

<p>&lt;EM&gt;, &lt;EM&gt; = &lt;Ctrl-U&gt; = ASCII 25 If we
are currently in graphics mode, return to text mode.</p>

<p>&lt;DLE&gt;..&lt;ETB&gt;, &lt;Ctrl-P&gt;..&lt;Ctrl-W&gt;
= ASCII 16-23 These codes can be used to select which modes
to print a certain part of the message file in. Each of
these control characters select a specific set of modes
(text screen, graphics screen, serial port) for which the
output is actually displayed:</p>

<p>Character Text Graph Serial
------------------------------------------------------
&lt;DLE&gt; = &lt;Ctrl-P&gt; = ASCII 16 No No No &lt;DC1&gt;
= &lt;Ctrl-Q&gt; = ASCII 17 Yes No No &lt;DC2&gt; =
&lt;Ctrl-R&gt; = ASCII 18 No Yes No &lt;DC3&gt; =
&lt;Ctrl-S&gt; = ASCII 19 Yes Yes No &lt;DC4&gt; =
&lt;Ctrl-T&gt; = ASCII 20 No No Yes &lt;NAK&gt; =
&lt;Ctrl-U&gt; = ASCII 21 Yes No Yes &lt;SYN&gt; =
&lt;Ctrl-V&gt; = ASCII 22 No Yes Yes &lt;ETB&gt; =
&lt;Ctrl-W&gt; = ASCII 23 Yes Yes Yes</p>

<p>For example: &lt;DC1&gt;Text mode&lt;DC2&gt;Graphics
mode&lt;DC4&gt;Serial port&lt;ETB&gt; ... will actually
print out which mode the console is in!</p>

<p>&lt;SUB&gt; = &lt;Ctrl-Z&gt; = ASCII 26 End of file (DOS
convention).</p>

<p>Comboot Images and other operating systems This version
of syslinux supports chain loading of other operating sys-
tems (such as MS-DOS and its derivatives, including Windows
95/98), as well as COMBOOT-style standalone executables (a
subset of DOS .COM files; see separate section below.)</p>

<p>Chain loading requires the boot sector of the foreign
operating system to be stored in a file in the root
directory of the filesystem. Because neither Linux kernels,
boot sector images, nor COMBOOT files have reliable magic
numbers, syslinux will look at the file extension. The
following extensions are recognised:</p>

<p>none or other Linux kernel image CBT COMBOOT image (not
runnable from DOS) BSS Boot sector (DOS superblock will be
patched in) BS Boot sector COM COMBOOT image (runnable from
DOS)</p>

<p>For filenames given on the command line, syslinux will
search for the file by adding extensions in the order listed
above if the plain file- name is not found. Filenames in
KERNEL statements must be fully quali- fied.</p>

<p>A COMBOOT file is a standalone executable in DOS .COM
format. They can, among other things, be produced by the
Etherboot package by Markus Gutschke and Ken Yap. The
following requirements apply for these files to be
sufficiently &quot;standalone&quot; for syslinux to be able
to load and run them:</p>

<p>&middot; The program must not execute any DOS calls
(since there is no DOS), although it may call the BIOS. The
only exception is that the program may execute INT 20h
(Terminate Program) to return to the syslinux prompt. Note
especially that INT 21h AH=4Ch, INT 21h AH=31h or INT 27h
are not supported.</p>

<p>&middot; Only the fields pspInt20 at offset 00h,
pspNextParagraph at off- set 02h and pspCommandTail at
offset 80h (contains the arguments from the syslinux command
line) in the PSP are supported. All other fields will
contain zero.</p>

<p>&middot; The program must not modify any main memory
outside its 64K seg- ment if it returns to syslinux via INT
20h.</p>

<p>Syslinux currently doesnt provide any form of API for
the use of COM- BOOT files. If there is need, a future
version may contain an INT interface to some syslinux
functions; please contact me if you have a need or ideas for
such an API.</p>

<p>Novice protection Syslinux will attempt to detect if the
user is trying to boot on a 286 or lower class machine, or a
machine with less than 608K of low (&quot;DOS&quot;) RAM
(which means the Linux boot sequence cannot complete). If
so, a message is displayed and the boot sequence aborted.
Holding down the Ctrl key while booting disables this
feature.</p>

<p>The compile time and date of a specific syslinux version
can be obtained by the DOS command &quot;type
ldlinux.sys&quot;. This is also used as the signature for
the LDLINUX.SYS file, which must match the boot sec- tor</p>

<p>Any file that syslinux uses can be marked hidden, system
or readonly if so is convenient; syslinux ignores all file
attributes. The SYSLINUX installed automatically sets the
readonly attribute on LDLINUX.SYS.</p>

<p>Bootable CD-ROMs SYSLINUX can be used to create bootdisk
images for El Torito-compatible bootable CD-ROMs. However,
it appears that many BIOSes are very buggy when it comes to
booting CD-ROMs. Some users have reported that the following
steps are helpful in making a CD-ROM that is bootable on the
largest possible number of machines:</p>

<p>&middot; Use the -s (safe, slow and stupid) option to
SYSLINUX</p>

<p>&middot; Put the boot image as close to the beginning of
the ISO 9660 filesystem as possible.</p>

<p>A CD-ROM is so much faster than a floppy that the -s
option shouldnt matter from a speed perspective.</p>

<p>Of course, you probably want to use ISOLINUX instead.
See the documen- tation file isolinux.doc.</p>

<p>Booting from a FAT partition on a hard disk SYSLINUX can
boot from a FAT filesystem partition on a hard disk
(including FAT32). The installation procedure is identical
to the pro- cedure for installing it on a floppy, and should
work under either DOS or Linux. To boot from a partition,
SYSLINUX needs to be launched from a Master Boot Record or
another boot loader, just like DOS itself would. A sample
master boot sector (mbr.bin) is included with SYSLINUX.</p>

<p>BUGS I would appreciate hearing of any problems you have
with SYSLINUX. I would also like to hear from you if you
have successfully used SYS- LINUX, especially if you are
using it for a distribution.</p>

<p>If you are reporting problems, please include all
possible information about your system and your BIOS; the
vast majority of all problems reported turn out to be BIOS
or hardware bugs, and I need as much information as possible
in order to diagnose the problems.</p>

users and for announcements of new and test versions. To
