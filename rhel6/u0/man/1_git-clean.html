<p>NAME git-clean - Remove untracked files from the working
tree</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS git clean [-d] [-f] [-n] [-q] [-x | -X] [--]
&lt;path&gt;...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Cleans the working tree by recursively
removing files that are not under version control, starting
from the current directory.</p>

<p>Normally, only files unknown to git are removed, but if
the -x option is specified, ignored files are also removed.
This can, for example, be useful to remove all build
products.</p>

<p>If any optional &lt;path&gt;... arguments are given,
only those paths are affected.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -d Remove untracked directories in addition to
untracked files. If an untracked directory is managed by a
different git repository, it is not removed by default. Use
-f option twice if you really want to remove such a
directory.</p>

<p>-f, --force If the git configuration variable
clean.requireForce is not set to false, git clean will
refuse to run unless given -f or -n.</p>

<p>-n, --dry-run Dont actually remove anything, just show
what would be done.</p>

<p>-q, --quiet Be quiet, only report errors, but not the
files that are successfully removed.</p>

<p>-x Dont use the ignore rules. This allows removing all
untracked files, including build products. This can be used
(possibly in conjunction with git reset) to create a
pristine working directory to test a clean build.</p>

<p>-X Remove only files ignored by git. This may be useful
to rebuild everything from scratch, but keep manually
created files.</p>
