<p>NAME rcs-checkin - check files into RCS</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rcs-checkin [FILE...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION rcs-checkin is a helper script for checking
files into RCS. This pro- gram is distributed with GNU
Emacs.</p>

<p>This program converts files with an old Emacs-style
version history for use with the Emacs 19 version control
interface VC, which likes to use RCS as its back end.</p>

<p>For each file to be processed, the script looks for
Emacs version files related to it. These files are checked
in as deltas, oldest first, so that the contents of the file
itself becomes the latest revision in the master.</p>

<p>The first line of each file is used as its description.
The file itself is not deleted, as under VC with
vc-keep-workfiles at its default of t, but all the version
files are.</p>

<p>If an argument file is already version-controlled under
RCS, any ver- sion files are added to the list of deltas and
deleted, and then the workfile is checked in again as the
latest version. This is probably not quite what was wanted,
and is the main reason VC doesnt simply call this to do
checkins.</p>

<p>In order to make it easier to use rcs-checkin *, files
which are detectably either RCS masters (with names ending
in ,v) or Emacs ver- sion files (with names containing ~)
are ignored.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The program accepts no options.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO The Emacs version control interface is
documented in the GNU Emacs man- ual, which you can read
using Info, either from Emacs or as a stan- dalone
program.</p>

<p>AUTHORS rcs-checkin was originally written by Paul
Eggert. It was revised for use with GNU Emacs VC by Eric S.
Raymond.</p>
