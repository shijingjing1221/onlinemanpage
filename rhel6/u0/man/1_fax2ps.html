<p>NAME fax2ps - convert a TIFF facsimile to compressed
PostScript</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS fax2ps [ options ] [ file ... ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION fax2ps reads one or more TIFF facsimile
image files and prints a com- pressed form of PostScript on
the standard output that is suitable for printing.</p>

<p>By default, each page is scaled to reflect the image
dimensions and resolutions stored in the file. The -x and -y
options can be used to specify the horizontal and vertical
image resolutions (lines/inch), respectively. If the -S
option is specified, each page is scaled to fill an output
page. The default output page is 8.5 by 11 inches. Alternate
page dimensions can be specified in inches with the -W and
-H options.</p>

<p>By default fax2ps generates PostScript for all pages in
the file. The -p option can be used to select one or more
pages from a multi-page document.</p>

<p>fax2ps generates a compressed form of PostScript that is
optimized for sending pages of text to a PostScript printer
attached to a host through a low-speed link (such as a
serial line). Each output page is filled with white and then
only the black areas are drawn. The PostScript specification
of the black drawing operations is optimized by using a
special font that encodes the move-draw operations required
to fill the black regions on the page. This compression
scheme typi- cally results in a substantially reduced
PostScript description, rela- tive to the straightforward
imaging of the page with a PostScript image operator. This
algorithm can, however, be ineffective for continuous- tone
and white-on-black images. For these images, it sometimes is
more efficient to send the raster bitmap image directly; see
tiff2ps(1).</p>

<p>OPTIONS -p number Print only the indicated page.
Multiple pages may be printed by specifying this option more
than once.</p>

<p>-x resolution Use resolution as the horizontal
resolution, in dots/inch, of the image data. By default this
value is taken from the file.</p>

<p>-y resolution Use resolution as the vertical resolution,
in lines/inch, of the image data. By default this value is
taken from the file.</p>

<p>-S Scale each page of image data to fill the output page
dimen- sions. By default images are presented according to
the dimension information recorded in the TIFF file.</p>

<p>-W width Use width as the width, in inches, of the
output page.</p>

<p>-H height Use height as the height, in inches, of the
output page.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS Some messages about malformed TIFF images
come from the TIFF library.</p>

<p>Various messages about badly formatted facsimile images
may be generated due to transmission errors in received
facsimile. fax2ps attempts to recover from such data errors
by resynchronizing decoding at the end of the current
scanline. This can result in long horizontal black lines in
the resultant PostScript image.</p>

<p>NOTES If the destination printer supports PostScript
Level II then it is always faster to just send the encoded
bitmap generated by the tiff2ps(1) program.</p>

<p>BUGS fax2ps should probably figure out when it is doing
a poor job of com- pressing the output and just generate
PostScript to image the bitmap raster instead.</p>
