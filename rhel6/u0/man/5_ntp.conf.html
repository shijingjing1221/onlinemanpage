<p>NAME ntp.conf - Server Options</p>

<p>Following is a description of the configuration commands
in NTPv4. There are two classes of commands, configuration
commands that config- ure an association with a remote
server, peer or reference clock, and auxilliary commands
that specify environmental variables that control various
related operations.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION COMMANDS The various modes are determined
by the command keyword and the required IP address.
Addresses are classed by type as (s) a remote server or peer
(IPv4 class A, B and C), (b) the broadcast address of a
local interface, (m) a multicast address (IPv4 class D), or
(r) a ref- erence clock address (127.127.x.x). The options
that can be used with these commands are listed below.</p>

<p>If the Basic Socket Interface Extensions for IPv6
(RFC-2553) is detected, support for the IPv6 address family
is generated in addition to the default support of the IPv4
address family. IPv6 addresses can be identified by the
presence of colons &quot;:&quot; in the address field. IPv6
addresses can be used almost everywhere where IPv4 addresses
can be used, with the exception of reference clock
addresses, which are always IPv4. Note that in contexts
where a host name is expected, a -4 quali- fier preceding
the host name forces DNS resolution to the IPv4 names- pace,
while a -6 qualifier forces DNS resolution to the IPv6
namespace.</p>

<p>There are three types of associations: persistent,
preemptable and ephemeral. Persistent associations are
mobilized by a configuration command and never demobilized.
Preemptable associations, which are new to NTPv4, are
mobilized by a configuration command which includes the
prempt flag and are demobilized by timeout or error.
Ephemeral associa- tions are mobilized upon arrival of
designated messages and demobilized by timeout or error.</p>

<p>server address [options ...]</p>

<p>peer address [options ...]</p>

<p>broadcast address [options ...]</p>

<p>manycastclient address [options ...] These four commands
specify the time server name or address to be used and the
mode in which to operate. The address can be either a DNS
name or a IP address in dotted-quad notation. Additional
information on association behavior can be found in the
Association Management page.</p>

<p>server For type s and r addresses (only), this command
nor- mally mobilizes a persistent client mode association
with the specified remote server or local reference clock.
If the preempt flag is specified, a preemptable association
is mobilized instead. In client mode the client clock can
synchronize to the remote server or local reference clock,
but the remote server can never be synchronized to the
client clock. This command should NOT be used for type b or
m addresses.</p>

<p>peer For type s addresses (only), this command mobilizes
a persistent symmetric-active mode association with the
specified remote peer. In this mode the local clock can be
synchronized to the remote peer or the remote peer can be
synchronized to the local clock. This is useful in a network
of servers where, depending on various failure scenarios,
either the local or remote peer may be the better source of
time. This command should NOT be used for type b, m or r
addresses.</p>

<p>broadcast For type b and m addresses (only), this
command mobi- lizes a persistent broadcast mode association.
Multiple commands can be used to specify multiple local
broad- cast interfaces (subnets) and/or multiple multicast
groups. Note that local broadcast messages go only to the
interface associated with the subnet specified, but
multicast messages go to all interfaces. In broadcast mode
the local server sends periodic broadcast messages to a
client population at the address specified, which is usually
the broadcast address on (one of) the local network(s) or a
multicast address assigned to NTP. The IANA has assigned the
multicast group address IPv4 224.0.1.1 and IPv6 ff05::101
(site local) exclusively to NTP, but other nonconflicting
addresses can be used to contain the messages within
administrative bound- aries. Ordinarily, this specification
applies only to the local server operating as a sender; for
operation as a broadcast client, see the broadcastclient or
mul- ticastclient commands below.</p>

<p>manycastclient For type m addresses (only), this command
mobilizes a preemptable manycast client mode association for
the multicast group address specified. In this mode a spe-
cific address must be supplied which matches the address
used on the manycastserver command for the des- ignated
manycast servers. The NTP multicast address 224.0.1.1
assigned by the IANA should NOT be used, unless specific
means are taken to avoid spraying large areas of the
Internet with these messages and causing a possibly massive
implosion of replies at the sender. The manycastclient
command specifies that the host is to operate in client mode
with the remote servers that are discovered as the result of
broadcast/multicast messages. The client broadcasts a
request message to the group address associated with the
specified address and specifically enabled servers respond
to these mes- sages. The client selects the servers
providing the best time and continues as with the server
command. The remaining servers are discarded as if never
heard.</p>

<p>COMMAND OPTIONS autokey All packets sent to and received
from the server or peer are to include authentication fields
encrypted using the autokey scheme described in the
Authentication Options page. This option is valid with all
commands.</p>

<p>burst When the server is reachable, send a burst of
eight packets instead of the usual one. The packet spacing
is normally 2 s; however, the spacing between the first and
second packets can be changed with the calldelay command to
allow additional time for a modem or ISDN call to complete.
This option is valid with only the server command and is a
recommended option with this command when the maxpoll option
is 11 or greater.</p>

<p>iburst When the server is unreachable, send a burst of
eight packets instead of the usual one. The packet spacing
is normally 2 s; however, the spacing between the first and
second packets can be changed with the calldelay command to
allow additional time for a modem or ISDN call to complete.
This option is valid with only the server command and is a
recommended option with this command.</p>

<p>key key All packets sent to and received from the server
or peer are to include authentication fields encrypted using
the specified key identifier with values from 1 to 65534,
inclusive. The default is to include no encryption field.
This option is valid with all commands.</p>

<p>minpoll minpoll</p>

<p>maxpoll maxpoll These options specify the minimum and
maximum poll intervals for NTP messages, in seconds as a
power of two. The maximum poll interval defaults to 10
(1,024 s), but can be increased by the maxpoll option to an
upper limit of 17 (36.4 h). The mini- mum poll interval
defaults to 6 (64 s), but can be decreased by the minpoll
option to a lower limit of 3 (8 s). These option are valid
only with the server and peer commands.</p>

<p>noselect Marks the server as unused, except for display
purposes. The server is discarded by the selection
algorithm. This option is valid only with the server and
peer commands.</p>

<p>preempt Specifies the association as preemptable rather
than the default persistent. This option is valied only with
the server command.</p>

<p>prefer Marks the server as preferred. All other things
being equal, this host will be chosen for synchronization
among a set of correctly operating hosts. See the Mitigation
Rules and the prefer Keyword page for further information.
This option is valid only with the server and peer
commands.</p>

<p>true Force the association to assume truechimer status;
that is, always survive the selection and clustering
algorithms. This option can be used with any association,
but is most useful for reference clocks with large jitter on
the serial port and pre- cision pulse-per-second (PPS)
signals. Caution: this option defeats the algorithms
designed to cast out falsetickers and can allow these
sources to set the system clock. This option is valid only
with the server and peer commands.</p>

<p>ttl ttl This option is used only with broadcast server
and manycast client modes. It specifies the time-to-live ttl
to use on broadcast server and multicast server and the
maximum ttl for the expanding ring search with manycast
client packets. Selec- tion of the proper value, which
defaults to 127, is something of a black art and should be
coordinated with the network administrator.</p>

<p>version version Specifies the version number to be used
for outgoing NTP pack- ets. Versions 1-4 are the choices,
with version 4 the default. This option is valid only with
the server, peer and broadcast commands.</p>

<p>AUXILLIARY COMMANDS broadcastclient [novolley] This
command enables reception of broadcast server messages to
any local interface (type b) address. Ordinarily, upon
receiv- ing a message for the first time, the broadcast
client measures the nominal server propagation delay using a
brief client/server exchange with the server, after which it
contin- ues in listen-only mode. If the novolley keyword is
present, the exchange is not used and the value specified in
the broad- castdelay command is used or, if the
broadcastdelay command is not used, the default 4.0 ms. Note
that, in order to avoid accidental or malicious disruption
in this mode, both the server and client should operate
using symmetric key or public key authentication as
described in the Authentication Options page. Note that the
novolley keyword is incompatible with pub- lic key
authentication.</p>

<p>manycastserver address [...] This command enables
reception of manycast client messages to the multicast group
address(es) (type m) specified. At least one address is
required. The NTP multicast address 224.0.1.1 assigned by
the IANA should NOT be used, unless specific means are taken
to limit the span of the reply and avoid a possibly massive
implosion at the original sender. Note that, in order to
avoid accidental or malicious disruption in this mode, both
the server and client should operate using symmetric key or
public key authentication as described in the Authentication
Options page.</p>

<p>multicastclient address [...] This command enables
reception of multicast server messages to the multicast
group address(es) (type m) specified. Upon receiving a
message for the first time, the multicast client measures
the nominal server propagation delay using a brief
client/server exchange with the server, then enters the
broad- cast client mode, in which it synchronizes to
succeeding multi- cast messages. Note that, in order to
avoid accidental or mali- cious disruption in this mode,
both the server and client should operate using symmetric
key or public key authentication as described in the
Authentication Options page.</p>

<p>BUGS The syntax checking is not picky; some combinations
of ridiculous and even hilarious options and modes may not
be detected.</p>
