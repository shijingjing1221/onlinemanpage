<p>&lt;poll.h&gt;(0P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
&lt;poll.h&gt;(0P)</p>

<p>NAME poll.h - definitions for the poll() function</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;poll.h&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The &lt;poll.h&gt; header shall define the
pollfd structure that includes at least the following
members:</p>

<p>int fd The following descriptor being polled. short
events The input event flags (see below). short revents The
output event flags (see below).</p>

<p>The &lt;poll.h&gt; header shall define the following
type through typedef:</p>

<p>nfds_t An unsigned integer type used for the number of
file descrip- tors.</p>

<p>The implementation shall support one or more programming
environments in which the width of nfds_t is no greater than
the width of type long. The names of these programming
environments can be obtained using the confstr() function or
the getconf utility.</p>

<p>The following symbolic constants shall be defined, zero
or more of which may be OR ed together to form the events or
revents members in the pollfd structure:</p>

<p>POLLIN Data other than high-priority data may be read
without blocking.</p>

<p>POLLRDNORM Normal data may be read without blocking.</p>

<p>POLLRDBAND Priority data may be read without
blocking.</p>

<p>POLLPRI High priority data may be read without
blocking.</p>

<p>POLLOUT Normal data may be written without blocking.</p>

<p>POLLWRNORM Equivalent to POLLOUT.</p>

<p>POLLWRBAND Priority data may be written.</p>

<p>POLLERR An error has occurred ( revents only).</p>

<p>POLLHUP Device has been disconnected ( revents
only).</p>

<p>POLLNVAL Invalid fd member ( revents only).</p>

<p>The significance and semantics of normal, priority, and
high-priority data are file and device-specific.</p>

<p>The following shall be declared as a function and may
also be defined as a macro. A function prototype shall be
provided.</p>

<p>int poll(struct pollfd[], nfds_t, int);</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
