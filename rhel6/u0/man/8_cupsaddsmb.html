<p>NAME cupsaddsmb - export printers to samba for windows
clients</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS cupsaddsmb [ -H samba-server ] [ -U
samba-user[%samba-password] ] [ -h cups-server[:port] ] [ -v
] -a cupsaddsmb [ -H samba-server ] [ -U
samba-user[%samba-password] ] [ -h cups-server[:port] ] [ -v
] printer [ ... printer ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION cupsaddsmb exports printers to the SAMBA
software (version 2.2.0 or higher) for use with Windows
clients. Depending on the SAMBA configura- tion, you may
need to provide a password to export the printers. This
program requires the Windows printer driver files described
below.</p>

<p>OPTIONS cupsaddsmb supports the following options:</p>

<p>-H samba-server Specifies the SAMBA server which
defaults to the CUPS server.</p>

<p>-U samba-user[%samba-password] Specifies the SAMBA print
admin username which defaults to your current username. If
the username contains a percent (%) charac- ter, then the
text following the percent is treated as the SAMBA password
to use.</p>

<p>-a Exports all known printers. Otherwise only the named
printers are exported.</p>

<p>-h cups-server[:port] Specifies a different CUPS server
to use.</p>

<p>-v Specifies that verbose information should be shown.
This is useful for debugging SAMBA configuration
problems.</p>

<p>SAMBA CONFIGURATION cupsaddsmb uses the new RPC-based
printing support in SAMBA 2.2.x to provide printer drivers
and PPD files to Windows client machines. In order to use
this functionality, you must first configure the SAMBA
smb.conf(5) file to support printing through CUPS and
provide a printer driver download share, as follows:</p>

<p>[global] load printers = yes printing = cups printcap
name = cups</p>

<p>[printers] comment = All Printers path =
/var/spool/samba browseable = no public = yes guest ok = yes
writable = no printable = yes</p>

<p>[print$] comment = Printer Drivers path =
/etc/samba/drivers browseable = yes guest ok = no read only
= yes write list = root</p>

<p>This configuration assumes a FHS-compliant installation
of SAMBA; adjust the [printers] and [print$] share paths
accordingly on your sys- tem as needed.</p>

<p>MICROSOFT POSTSCRIPT DRIVERS FOR WINDOWS The base driver
for Windows 2000 and higher is the Microsoft PostScript
driver, which is available on any system running Windows
2000 or higher in the %WINDIR%TEM32OLSW32X863 folder for
32-bit drivers and %WINDIR%TEM32OLS4-bit drivers.</p>

<p>The CUPS printer driver is preferred over the Microsoft
driver since it supports the page-label, job-billing, and
job-hold-until options fully on all printers. However,
currently only Windows 2000 and higher is supported by the
Microsoft driver, so you will also need to get the Adobe
driver to support Windows 95, 98, and Me clients. The Adobe
and Microsoft drivers for Windows 2000 are identical.</p>

<p>Once you have extracted the driver files, copy the
32-bit drivers to the /usr/share/cups/drivers directory and
the 64-bit drivers to the /usr/share/cups/drivers/x64
directory exactly as named below:</p>

<p>[Windows 2000 and higher] ps5ui.dll pscript.hlp
pscript.ntf pscript5.dll</p>

<p>Note: Unlike Windows, case is significant - make sure
that you use the lowercase filenames shown above, otherwise
cupsaddsmb will fail to export the drivers.</p>

<p>CUPS POSTSCRIPT DRIVERS FOR WINDOWS cupsaddsmb can use
the CUPS v6 PostScript printer driver for Windows, which is
available for download from the CUPS web site.</p>

<p>The CUPS printer driver is preferred over the Adobe and
Microsoft drivers since it supports the page-label,
job-billing, and job-hold- until options fully on all
printers. However, currently only Windows 2000 and higher is
supported by the CUPS driver, so you will also need to get
the Adobe driver to support Windows 95, 98, and Me
clients.</p>

<p>Once you have extracted the driver files, copy the
32-bit drivers to the /usr/share/cups/drivers directory and
the 64-bit drivers to the /usr/share/cups/drivers/x64
directory exactly as named below:</p>

<p>[Windows 2000 and higher] cups6.inf (from www.cups.org)
cups6.ini (from www.cups.org) cupsps6.dll (from
www.cups.org) cupsui6.dll (from www.cups.org) ps5ui.dll
(from your Windows system) pscript.hlp (from your Windows
system) pscript.ntf (from your Windows system) pscript5.dll
(from your Windows system)</p>

<p>Note: Unlike Windows, case is significant - make sure
that you use the lowercase filenames shown above, otherwise
cupsaddsmb will fail to export the drivers.</p>

<p>ADOBE POSTSCRIPT DRIVERS FOR WINDOWS 95, 98, AND ME
cupsaddsmb can use the Adobe PostScript printer driver for
Windows 95, 98, and ME, which are available for download
from the Adobe web site (http://www.adobe.com).</p>

<p>The Adobe driver does not support the page-label,
job-billing, or job- hold-until options.</p>

<p>Once you have installed the driver on a Windows system,
copy the fol- lowing files to the /usr/share/cups/drivers
directory exactly as named below:</p>

<p>[Windows 95, 98, and Me] ADFONTS.MFM ADOBEPS4.DRV
ADOBEPS4.HLP ICONLIB.DLL PSMON.DLL</p>

<p>Note: Unlike Windows, case is significant - make sure
that you use the UPPERCASE filenames shown above, otherwise
cupsaddsmb will fail to export the drivers.</p>

<p>KNOWN ISSUES Getting the full set of Windows driver
files should be easier.</p>
