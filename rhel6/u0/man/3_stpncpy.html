<p>STPNCPY(3) Linux Programmer s Manual STPNCPY(3)</p>

<p>NAME stpncpy - copy a fixed-size string, returning a
pointer to its end</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #define _GNU_SOURCE #include
&lt;string.h&gt;</p>

<p>char *stpncpy(char *dest, const char *src, size_t
n);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The stpncpy() function copies at most n
characters from the string pointed to by src, including the
terminating &rsquo; &rsquo; character, to the array pointed
to by dest. Exactly n characters are written at dest. If the
length strlen(src) is smaller than n, the remaining
characters in the array pointed to by dest are filled with
&rsquo; &rsquo; characters. If the length strlen(src) is
greater or equal to n, the string pointed to by dest will
not be &rsquo; &rsquo; terminated.</p>

<p>The strings may not overlap.</p>

<p>The programmer must ensure that there is room for at
least n characters at dest.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE stpncpy() returns a pointer to the
terminating null in dest, or, if dest is not
null-terminated, dest + n.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO This function is a GNU extension.</p>
