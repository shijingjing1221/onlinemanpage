<p>WCSNCPY(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual WCSNCPY(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME wcsncpy - copy part of a wide-character string</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;wchar.h&gt;</p>

<p>wchar_t *wcsncpy(wchar_t *restrict ws1, const wchar_t
*restrict ws2, size_t n);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The wcsncpy() function shall copy not more
than n wide-character codes (wide-character codes that
follow a null wide-character code are not copied) from the
array pointed to by ws2 to the array pointed to by ws1. If
copying takes place between objects that overlap, the
behavior is undefined.</p>

<p>If the array pointed to by ws2 is a wide-character
string that is shorter than n wide-character codes, null
wide-character codes shall be appended to the copy in the
array pointed to by ws1, until n wide-char- acter codes in
all are written.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The wcsncpy() function shall return ws1; no
return value is reserved to indicate an error.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE If there is no null wide-character
code in the first n wide-character codes of the array
pointed to by ws2, the result is not null-termi- nated.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
