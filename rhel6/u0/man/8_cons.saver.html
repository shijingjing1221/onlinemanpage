<p>NAME cons.saver - general-purpose Linux console screen
save and restore server</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS cons.saver TTY</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Invoke this helper program with the Ctrl-o
key combination to save and restore the user session on the
screen.</p>

<p>OPTIONS cons.saver takes only one argument, the TTY NAME
from which the system will save and restore.</p>

<p>SECURITY Cons.saver does not need to be invoked by root.
It only needs read and write access to /dev/vcsa*, which is
a priviledged operation. You should create an unprivileged
user, make cons.saver setuid to that user, and assure that
all the vcsa* are owned by that user too.</p>
