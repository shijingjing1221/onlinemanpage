<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME platform - System identification support code and
utilities</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS package require platform ?1.0.4?</p>

<p>platform::generic platform::identify platform::patterns
identifier
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The platform package provides several
utility commands useful for the identification of the
architecture of a machine running Tcl.</p>

<p>Whilst Tcl provides the tcl_platform array for
identifying the current architecture (in particular, the
platform and machine elements) this is not always
sufficient. This is because (on Unix machines) tcl_platform
reflects the values returned by the uname command and these
are not standardized across platforms and architectures. In
addition, on at least one platform (AIX) the
tcl_platform(machine) contains the CPU serial number.</p>

<p>Consequently, individual applications need to manipulate
the values in tcl_platform (along with the output of system
specific utilities) - which is both inconvenient for
developers, and introduces the potential for inconsistencies
in identifying architectures and in naming conven-
tions.</p>

<p>The platform package prevents such fragmentation - i.e.,
it establishes a standard naming convention for
architectures running Tcl and makes it more convenient for
developers to identify the current architecture a Tcl
program is running on.</p>

<p>COMMANDS platform::identify This command returns an
identifier describing the platform the Tcl core is running
on. The returned identifier has the general format OS-CPU.
The OS part of the identifier may contain details like
kernel version, libc version, etc., and this information may
contain dashes as well. The CPU part will not contain
dashes, making the preceding dash the last dash in the
result.</p>

<p>platform::generic This command returns a simplified
identifier describing the platform the Tcl core is running
on. In contrast to plat- form::identify it leaves out
details like kernel version, libc version, etc. The returned
identifier has the general format OS- CPU.</p>

<p>platform::patterns identifier This command takes an
identifier as returned by platform::iden- tify and returns a
list of identifiers describing compatible architectures.</p>
