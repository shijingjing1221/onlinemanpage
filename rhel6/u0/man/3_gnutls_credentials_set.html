<p>gnutls_credentials_set(3) gnutls
gnutls_credentials_set(3)</p>

<p>NAME gnutls_credentials_set - Sets the needed
credentials for the specified authentication algorithm.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;gnutls/gnutls.h&gt;</p>

<p>int gnutls_credentials_set(gnutls_session_t session,
gnutls_creden- tials_type_t type, void * cred);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS gnutls_session_t session is a gnutls_session_t
structure.</p>

<p>gnutls_credentials_type_t type is the type of the
credentials</p>

<p>void * cred is a pointer to a structure.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Sets the needed credentials for the
specified type. Eg username, pass- word - or public and
private keys etc. The cred parameter is a struc- ture that
depends on the specified type and on the current session
(client or server).</p>

<p>In order to minimize memory usage, and share credentials
between sev- eral threads gnutls keeps a pointer to cred,
and not the whole cred structure. Thus you will have to keep
the structure allocated until you call gnutls_deinit().</p>

<p>For GNUTLS_CRD_ANON, cred should be
gnutls_anon_client_credentials_t in case of a client. In
case of a server it should be
gnutls_anon_server_credentials_t.</p>

<p>For GNUTLS_CRD_SRP, cred should be
gnutls_srp_client_credentials_t in case of a client, and
gnutls_srp_server_credentials_t, in case of a server.</p>

<p>For GNUTLS_CRD_CERTIFICATE, cred should be
gnutls_certificate_creden- tials_t.</p>

<p>RETURNS On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (zero) is returned,
otherwise an error code is returned.</p>
