<p>COL(1) BSD General Commands Manual COL(1)</p>

<p>NAME col - filter reverse line feeds from input</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS col [-bfpx] [-l num]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Col filters out reverse (and half reverse)
line feeds so the output is in the correct order with only
forward and half forward line feeds, and replaces
white-space characters with tabs where possible. This can be
useful in processing the output of nroff(1) and tbl(1).</p>

<p>Col reads from standard input and writes to standard
output.</p>

<p>The options are as follows:</p>

<p>-b Do not output any backspaces, printing only the last
character written to each column position.</p>

<p>-f Forward half line feeds are permitted (fine mode).
Normally characters printed on a half line boundary are
printed on the fol- lowing line.</p>

<p>-p Force unknown control sequences to be passed through
unchanged. Normally, col will filter out any control
sequences from the input other than those recognized and
interpreted by itself, which are listed below.</p>

<p>-x Output multiple spaces instead of tabs.</p>

<p>-lnum Buffer at least num lines in memory. By default,
128 lines are buffered.</p>

<p>The control sequences for carriage motion that col
understands and their decimal values are listed in the
following table:</p>

<p>ESC-7 reverse line feed (escape then 7) ESC-8 half
reverse line feed (escape then 8) ESC-9 half forward line
feed (escape then 9) backspace moves back one column (8);
ignored in the first column carriage return (13) newline
forward line feed (10); also does carriage return shift in
shift to normal character set (15) shift out shift to
alternate character set (14) space moves forward one column
(32) tab moves forward to next tab stop (9) vertical tab
reverse line feed (11)</p>

<p>All unrecognized control characters and escape sequences
are discarded.</p>

<p>Col keeps track of the character set as characters are
read and makes sure the character set is correct when they
are output.</p>

<p>If the input attempts to back up to the last flushed
line, col will dis- play a warning message.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO expand(1), nroff(1), tbl(1)</p>

<p>STANDARDS The col utility conforms to the Single UNIX
Specification, Version 2. The -l option is an extension to
the standard.</p>

<p>HISTORY A col command appeared in Version 6 AT&amp;T
UNIX.</p>

<p>AVAILABILITY The col command is part of the
util-linux-ng package and is available from
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux-ng/.</p>
