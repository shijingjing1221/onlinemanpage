<p>NAME tracehook_report_clone - in parent, new child is
about to start running</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS void tracehook_report_clone(struct pt_regs *
regs, unsigned long clone_flags, pid_t pid, struct
task_struct * child);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS regs parent&acute;s user register state</p>

<p>clone_flags flags from parent&acute;s system call</p>

<p>pid new child&acute;s PID in the parent&acute;s
namespace</p>

<p>child new child task</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Called after a child is set up, but before
it has been started running. This is not a good place to
block, because the child has not started yet. Suspend the
child here if desired, and then block in
tracehook_report_clone_complete. This must prevent the child
from self-reaping if tracehook_report_clone_complete uses
the child pointer; otherwise it might have died and been
released by the time tracehook_report_clone_complete is
called.</p>

<p>Called with no locks held, but the child cannot run
until this returns.</p>
