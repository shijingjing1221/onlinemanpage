<p>DESCRIPTION The xdg-icon-resource program can be used to
install icon resources into the desktop icon system in order
to illustrate menu entries, to depict desktop icons or to
graphically represent file types.</p>

<p>The desktop icon system identifies icons by name.
Depending on the required size, the choice of icon theme and
the context in which the icon is used, the desktop icon
system locates an appropriate icon resource to depict an
icon. Icon resources can be XPM files or PNG files.</p>

<p>The desktop icon system works according to the XDG Icon
Theme Specification at
http://www.freedesktop.org/Standards/icon-theme-spec</p>

<p>COMMANDS install Installs the icon file indicated by
icon-file to the desktop icon system under the name
icon-name. Icon names do not have an extension. If icon-name
is not provided the name is derived from icon-file. The icon
file must have .png or .xpm as extension. If a corresponding
.icon file exists in the same location as icon-file it will
be installed as well.</p>

<p>uninstall Removes the icon indicated by icon-name from
the desktop icon system. Note that icon names do not have an
extension.</p>

<p>forceupdate Force an update of the desktop icon system.
This is only useful if the last call to xdg-icon-resource
included the --noupdate option.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --noupdate Postpone updating the desktop icon
system. If multiple icons are added in sequence this flag
can be used to indicate that additional changes will follow
and that it is not necessary to update the desktop icon
system right away.</p>

<p>--novendor Normally, xdg-icon-resource checks to ensure
that an icon file to be installed in the apps context has a
proper vendor prefix. This option can be used to disable
that check.</p>

<p>A vendor prefix consists of alpha characters ([a-zA-Z])
and is terminated with a dash (&quot;-&quot;). Companies and
organizations are encouraged to use a word or phrase,
preferably the organizations name, for which they hold a
trademark as their vendor prefix. The purpose of the vendor
prefix is to prevent name conflicts.</p>

<p>--theme theme Installs or removes the icon file as part
of theme. If no theme is specified the icons will be
installed as part of the default hicolor theme. Applications
may install icons under multiple themes but should at least
install icons for the default hicolor theme.</p>

<p>--context context Specifies the context for the icon.
Icons to be used in the application menu and as desktop icon
should use apps as context which is the default context.
Icons to be used as file icons should use mimetypes as
context. Other common contexts are actions, devices,
emblems, filesystems and stock.</p>

<p>--size size Specifies the size of the icon. All icons
must be square. Common sizes for icons in the apps context
are: 16, 22, 32, 48, 64 and 128. Common sizes for icons in
the mimetypes context are: 16, 22, 32, 48, 64 and 128</p>

<p>--mode mode mode can be user or system. In user mode the
file is (un)installed for the current user only. In system
mode the file is (un)installed for all users on the system.
Usually only root is allowed to install in system mode.</p>

<p>The default is to use system mode when called by root
and to use user mode when called by a non-root user.</p>

<p>--help Show command synopsis.</p>

<p>--version Show the xdg-utils version information.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES xdg-icon-resource honours the
following environment variables:</p>

<p>XDG_UTILS_DEBUG_LEVEL Setting this environment variable
to a non-zero numerical value makes xdg-icon-resource do
more verbose reporting on stderr. Setting a higher value
increases the verbosity.</p>

<p>XDG_UTILS_INSTALL_MODE This environment variable can be
used by the user or administrator to override the
installation mode. Valid values are user and system.</p>

<p>EXIT CODES An exit code of 0 indicates success while a
non-zero exit code indicates failure. The following failure
codes can be returned:</p>

<p>1 Error in command line syntax.</p>

<p>2 One of the files passed on the command line did not
exist.</p>

<p>3 A required tool could not be found.</p>

<p>4 The action failed.</p>

<p>5 No permission to read one of the files passed on the
command line.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO xdg-desktop-icon(1), xdg-desktop-menu(1),
xdg-mime(1)</p>

<p>EXAMPLES To install an icon resource to depict a
launcher for the application myfoobar, the company
ShinyThings Inc. can use:</p>

<p>xdg-icon-resource install --size 64
shinythings-myfoobar.png</p>

<p>To install an icon for a new application/x-foobar file
type one can use:</p>

<p>xdg-icon-resource install --context mimetypes --size 48
./mime-foobar-48.png application-x-foobar xdg-icon-resource
install --context mimetypes --size 64 ./mime-foobar-64.png
application-x-foobar</p>

<p>This will install two icons with the name
application-x-foobar but with different sizes.</p>
