<p>Tk_Grab(3) Tk Library Procedures Tk_Grab(3)</p>


<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME Tk_Grab, Tk_Ungrab - manipulate grab state in an
application</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tk.h&gt;</p>

<p>int Tk_Grab(interp, tkwin, grabGlobal)</p>

<p>void Tk_Ungrab(tkwin)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS Tcl_Interp *interp (in) Interpreter to use for
error reporting</p>

<p>Tk_Window tkwin (in) Window on whose behalf the pointer
is to be grabbed or released</p>

<p>int grabGlobal (in) Boolean indicating whether the grab
is global or appli- cation local
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION These functions are used to set or release a
global or application local grab. When a grab is set on a
particular window in a Tk applica- tion, mouse and keyboard
events can only be received by that window and its
descendants. Mouse and keyboard events for windows outside
the tree rooted at tkwin will be redirected to tkwin. If the
grab is global, then all mouse and keyboard events for
windows outside the tree rooted at tkwin (even those
intended for windows in other applications) will be
redirected to tkwin. If the grab is application local, only
mouse and keyboard events intended for a windows within the
same appli- cation (but outside the tree rooted at tkwin)
will be redirected.</p>

<p>Tk_Grab sets a grab on a particular window. Tkwin
specifies the window on whose behalf the pointer is to be
grabbed. GrabGlobal indicates whether the grab should be
global or application local; if it is non- zero, it means
the grab should be global. Normally, Tk_Grab returns TCL_OK;
if an error occurs and the grab cannot be set, TCL_ERROR is
returned and an error message is left if interps result.
Once this call completes successfully, no window outside the
tree rooted at tkwin will receive pointer- or
keyboard-related events until the next call to Tk_Ungrab. If
a previous grab was in effect within the application, then
it is replaced with a new one.</p>

<p>Tcl_Ungrab releases a grab on the mouse pointer and
keyboard, if there is one set on the window given by tkwin.
Once a grab is released, pointer and keyboard events will
start being delivered to other windows again.</p>
