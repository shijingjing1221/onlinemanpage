<p>BLK_QUEUE_MAKE_REQUE(9) Block Devices
BLK_QUEUE_MAKE_REQUE(9)</p>

<p>NAME blk_queue_make_request - define an alternate
make_request function for a device</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS void blk_queue_make_request(struct
request_queue * q, make_request_fn * mfn);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS q the request queue for the device to be
affected</p>

<p>mfn the alternate make_request function</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The normal way for struct bios to be passed
to a device driver is for them to be collected into requests
on a request queue, and then to allow the device driver to
select requests off that queue when it is ready. This works
well for many block devices. However some block devices
(typically virtual devices such as md or lvm) do not benefit
from the processing on the request queue, and are served
best by having the requests passed directly to them. This
can be achieved by providing a function to
blk_queue_make_request.</p>

<p>CAVEAT The driver that does this *must* be able to deal
appropriately with buffers in highmemory. This can be
accomplished by either calling __bio_kmap_atomic to get a
temporary kernel mapping, or by calling blk_queue_bounce to
create a buffer in normal memory.</p>
