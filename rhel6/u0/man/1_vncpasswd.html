<p>NAME vncpasswd - change a VNC password</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS vncpasswd [passwd-file]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION vncpasswd allows you to set the password
used to access VNC desktops. It stores an obfuscated version
of the password in the given file (default
$HOME/.vnc/passwd). The vncserver script runs vncpasswd the
first time you start a VNC desktop, and invokes Xvnc with
the appropri- ate -rfbauth option. vncviewer can also be
given a password file to use via the -passwd option.</p>

<p>The password must be at least six characters long, and
only the first eight characters are significant. Note that
the stored password is not encrypted securely - anyone who
has access to this file can trivially find out the plaintext
password, so vncpasswd always sets appropriate permissions
(read and write only by the owner). However, when access-
ing a VNC desktop a challenge-response mechanism is used
over the wire making it hard for anyone to crack the
password simply by snooping on the network.</p>

<p>FILES $HOME/.vnc/passwd Default location of the VNC
password file.</p>
