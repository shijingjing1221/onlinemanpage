<p>ISWLOWER(3) Linux Programmer s Manual ISWLOWER(3)</p>

<p>NAME iswlower - test for lowercase wide character</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;wctype.h&gt;</p>

<p>int iswlower(wint_t wc);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The iswlower() function is the
wide-character equivalent of the islower(3) function. It
tests whether wc is a wide character belonging to the
wide-character class &quot;lower&quot;.</p>

<p>The wide-character class &quot;lower&quot; is a subclass
of the wide-character class &quot;alpha&quot;, and therefore
also a subclass of the wide-character class
&quot;alnum&quot;, of the wide-character class
&quot;graph&quot; and of the wide- character class
&quot;print&quot;.</p>

<p>Being a subclass of the wide-character class
&quot;print&quot;, the wide-charac- ter class
&quot;lower&quot; is disjoint from the wide-character class
&quot;cntrl&quot;.</p>

<p>Being a subclass of the wide-character class
&quot;graph&quot;, the wide-charac- ter class
&quot;lower&quot; is disjoint from the wide-character class
&quot;space&quot; and its subclass &quot;blank&quot;.</p>

<p>Being a subclass of the wide-character class
&quot;alnum&quot;, the wide-charac- ter class
&quot;lower&quot; is disjoint from the wide-character class
&quot;punct&quot;.</p>

<p>Being a subclass of the wide-character class
&quot;alpha&quot;, the wide-charac- ter class
&quot;lower&quot; is disjoint from the wide-character class
&quot;digit&quot;.</p>

<p>The wide-character class &quot;lower&quot; contains at
least those characters wc which are equal to towlower(wc)
and different from towupper(wc).</p>

<p>The wide-character class &quot;lower&quot; always
contains at least the letters &rsquo;a&rsquo; to
&rsquo;z&rsquo;.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The iswlower() function returns non-zero if
wc is a wide character belonging to the wide-character class
&quot;lower&quot;. Otherwise it returns zero.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO C99.</p>

<p>NOTES The behavior of iswlower() depends on the LC_CTYPE
category of the cur- rent locale.</p>

<p>This function is not very appropriate for dealing with
Unicode charac- ters, because Unicode knows about three
cases: upper, lower and title case.</p>
