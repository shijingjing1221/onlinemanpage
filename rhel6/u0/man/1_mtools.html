<p>Name mtools - utilities to access DOS disks in Unix.</p>

<p>Introduction Mtools is a collection of tools to allow
Unix systems to manipulate MS- DOS files: read, write, and
move around files on an MS-DOS filesystem (typically a
floppy disk). Where reasonable, each program attempts to
emulate the MS-DOS equivalent command. However, unnecessary
restric- tions and oddities of DOS are not emulated. For
instance, it is possi- ble to move subdirectories from one
subdirectory to another.</p>

<p>Mtools is sufficient to give access to MS-DOS
filesystems. For instance, commands such as mdir a: work on
the a: floppy without any preliminary mounting or
initialization (assuming the default /etc/mtools.conf works
on your machine). With mtools, one can change floppies too
without unmounting and mounting.</p>

<p>Where to get mtools Mtools can be found at the following
places (and their mirrors):</p>

<p>http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/mtools/mtools-4.0.12.tar.gz
http://mtools.linux.lu/mtools-4.0.12.tar.gz
ftp://www.tux.org/pub/knaff/mtools/mtools-4.0.12.tar.gz
ftp://ibiblio.unc.edu/pub/Linux/utils/disk-management/mtools-4.0.12.tar.gz</p>

<p>Before reporting a bug, make sure that it has not yet
been fixed in the Alpha patches which can be found at:</p>

<p>http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/mtools/ http://mtools.linux.lu/
ftp://www.tux.org/pub/knaff/mtools</p>

<p>These patches are named mtools-version-ddmm.taz, where
version stands for the base version, dd for the day and mm
for the month. Due to a lack of space, I usually leave only
the most recent patch.</p>

<p>There is an mtools mailing list at mtools @ tux.org .
Please send all bug reports to this list. You may subscribe
to the list by sending a message with subscribe mtools @
tux.org in its body to majordomo @ tux.org . (N.B. Please
remove the spaces around the &quot;@&quot; both times. I
left them there in order to fool spambots.) Announcements of
new mtools versions will also be sent to the list, in
addition to the linux announce newsgroups. The mailing list
is archived at
http://lists.gnu.org/pipermail/info-mtools/</p>

<p>Common features of all mtools commands Options and
filenames MS-DOS filenames are composed of a drive letter
followed by a colon, a subdirectory, and a filename. Only
the filename part is mandatory, the drive letter and the
subdirectory are optional. Filenames without a drive letter
refer to Unix files. Subdirectory names can use either the /
or separator. The use of the separator or wildcards requires
the names to be enclosed in quotes to protect them from the
shell. However, wildcards in Unix filenames should not be
enclosed in quotes, because here we want the shell to expand
them.</p>

<p>The regular expression &quot;pattern matching&quot;
routines follow the Unix- style rules. For example, *
matches all MS-DOS files in lieu of *.* . The archive,
hidden, read-only and system attribute bits are ignored
during pattern matching.</p>

<p>All options use the - (minus) as their first character,
not / as youd expect in MS-DOS.</p>

<p>Most mtools commands allow multiple filename parameters,
which doesnt follow MS-DOS conventions, but which is more
user-friendly.</p>

<p>Most mtools commands allow options that instruct them
how to handle file name clashes. See section name clashes,
for more details on these. All commands accept the -V flags
which prints the version, and most accept the -v flag, which
switches on verbose mode. In verbose mode, these commands
print out the name of the MS-DOS files upon which they act,
unless stated otherwise. See section Commands, for a
description of the options which are specific to each
command.</p>

<p>Drive letters The meaning of the drive letters depends
on the target architectures. However, on most target
architectures, drive A is the first floppy drive, drive B is
the second floppy drive (if available), drive J is a Jaz
drive (if available), and drive Z is a Zip drive (if
available). On those systems where the device name is
derived from the SCSI id, the Jaz drive is assumed to be at
Scsi target 4, and the Zip at Scsi target 5 (factory default
settings). On Linux, both drives are assumed to be the
second drive on the Scsi bus (/dev/sdb). The default
settings can be changes using a configuration file (see
section Configuration).</p>

<p>The drive letter : (colon) has a special meaning. It is
used to access image files which are directly specified on
the command line using the -i options.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>mcopy -i my-image-file.bin ::file1 ::file2 .</p>

<p>This copies file1 and file2 from the image file
(my-image-file.bin) to the /tmp directory.</p>

<p>You can also supply an offset within the image file by
including @@off- set into the file name.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>mcopy -i my-image-file.bin@@1M ::file1 ::file2 .</p>

<p>This looks for the image at the offset of 1M in the
file, rather than at its beginning.</p>

<p>Current working directory The mcd command (mcd) is used
to establish the device and the current working directory
(relative to the MS-DOS filesystem), otherwise the default
is assumed to be A:/. However, unlike MS-DOS, there is only
one working directory for all drives, and not one per
drive.</p>

<p>VFAT-style long file names This version of mtools
supports VFAT style long filenames. If a Unix filename is
too long to fit in a short DOS name, it is stored as a VFAT
long name, and a companion short name is generated. This
short name is what you see when you examine the disk with a
pre-7.0 version of DOS. The following table shows some
examples of short names:</p>

<p>Long name MS-DOS name Reason for the change ---------
---------- --------------------- thisisatest THISIS~1
filename too long alain.knaff ALAIN~1.KNA extension too long
prn.txt PRN~1.TXT PRN is a device name .abc ABC~1 null
filename hot+cold HOT_CO~1 illegal character</p>

<p>As you see, the following transformations happen to
derive a short name:</p>

<p>* Illegal characters are replaced by underscores. The
illegal characters are ;+=[],</p>

<p>* Extra dots, which cannot be interpreted as a main
name/extension separator are removed</p>

<p>* A ~n number is generated,</p>

<p>* The name is shortened so as to fit in the 8+3
limitation</p>

<p>The initial Unix-style file name (whether long or short)
is also called the primary name, and the derived short name
is also called the secondary name.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>mcopy /etc/motd a:Reallylongname</p>

<p>Mtools creates a VFAT entry for Reallylongname, and uses
REALLYLO as a short name. Reallylongname is the primary
name, and REALLYLO is the secondary name.</p>

<p>mcopy /etc/motd a:motd</p>

<p>Motd fits into the DOS filename limits. Mtools doesnt
need to derivate another name. Motd is the primary name, and
there is no sec- ondary name.</p>

<p>In a nutshell: The primary name is the long name, if one
exists, or the short name if there is no long name.</p>

<p>Although VFAT is much more flexible than FAT, there are
still names that are not acceptable, even in VFAT. There are
still some illegal characters left (</p>

<p>Unix name Long name Reason for the change ---------
---------- --------------------- prn prn-1 PRN is a device
name ab:c ab_c-1 illegal character</p>

<p>As you see, the following transformations happen if a
long name is illegal:</p>

<p>* Illegal characters are replaces by underscores,</p>

<p>* A -n number is generated,</p>

<p>Name clashes When writing a file to disk, its long name
or short name may collide with an already existing file or
directory. This may happen for all commands which create new
directory entries, such as mcopy, mmd, mren, mmove. When a
name clash happens, mtools asks you what it should do. It
offers several choices:</p>

<p>overwrite Overwrites the existing file. It is not
possible to overwrite a directory with a file.</p>

<p>rename Renames the newly created file. Mtools prompts
for the new file- name</p>

<p>autorename Renames the newly created file. Mtools
chooses a name by itself, without prompting</p>

<p>skip Gives up on this file, and moves on to the next (if
any)</p>

<p>To chose one of these actions, type its first letter at
the prompt. If you use a lower case letter, the action only
applies for this file only, if you use an upper case letter,
the action applies to all files, and you wont be prompted
again.</p>

<p>You may also chose actions (for all files) on the
command line, when invoking mtools:</p>

<p>-D o Overwrites primary names by default.</p>

<p>-D O Overwrites secondary names by default.</p>

<p>-D r Renames primary name by default.</p>

<p>-D R Renames secondary name by default.</p>

<p>-D a Autorenames primary name by default.</p>

<p>-D A Autorenames secondary name by default.</p>

<p>-D s Skip primary name by default.</p>

<p>-D S Skip secondary name by default.</p>

<p>-D m Ask user what to do with primary name.</p>

<p>-D M Ask user what to do with secondary name.</p>

<p>Note that for command line switches lower/upper
differentiates between primary/secondary name whereas for
interactive choices, lower/upper differentiates between
just-this-time/always.</p>

<p>The primary name is the name as displayed in Windows 95
or Windows NT: i.e. the long name if it exists, and the
short name otherwise. The secondary name is the
&quot;hidden&quot; name, i.e. the short name if a long name
exists.</p>

<p>By default, the user is prompted if the primary name
clashes, and the secondary name is autorenamed.</p>

<p>If a name clash occurs in a Unix directory, mtools only
asks whether to overwrite the file, or to skip it.</p>

<p>Case sensitivity of the VFAT filesystem The VFAT
filesystem is able to remember the case of the filenames.
How- ever, filenames which differ only in case are not
allowed to coexist in the same directory. For example if you
store a file called LongFileName on a VFAT filesystem, mdir
shows this file as LongFileName, and not as Longfilename.
However, if you then try to add LongFilename to the same
directory, it is refused, because case is ignored for clash
checks.</p>

<p>The VFAT filesystem allows to store the case of a
filename in the attribute byte, if all letters of the
filename are the same case, and if all letters of the
extension are the same case too. Mtools uses this
information when displaying the files, and also to generate
the Unix filename when mcopying to a Unix directory. This
may have unexpected results when applied to files written
using an pre-7.0 version of DOS: Indeed, the old style
filenames map to all upper case. This is differ- ent from
the behavior of the old version of mtools which used to
gener- ate lower case Unix filenames.</p>

<p>high capacity formats Mtools supports a number of
formats which allow to store more data on disk as usual. Due
to different operating system abilities, these for- mats are
not supported on all OSes. Mtools recognizes these formats
transparently where supported.</p>

<p>In order to format these disks, you need to use an
operating system specific tool. For Linux, suitable floppy
tools can be found in the fdutils package at the following
locations~:</p>

<p>ftp://www.tux.org/pub/knaff/fdutils/.
ftp://ibiblio.unc.edu/pub/Linux/utils/disk-management/fdutils-*</p>

<p>See the manpages included in that package for further
detail: Use superformat to format all formats except XDF,
and use xdfcopy to format XDF.</p>

<p>More sectors The oldest method of fitting more data on a
disk is to use more sectors and more cylinders. Although the
standard format uses 80 cylinders and 18 sectors (on a 3 1/2
high density disk), it is possible to use up to 83 cylinders
(on most drives) and up to 21 sectors. This method allows to
store up to 1743K on a 3 1/2 HD disk. However, 21 sector
disks are twice as slow as the standard 18 sector disks
because the sectors are packed so close together that we
need to interleave them. This problem doesnt exist for 20
sector formats.</p>

<p>These formats are supported by numerous DOS shareware
utilities such as fdformat and vgacopy. In his infinite
hybris, Bill Gate$ believed that he invented this, and
called it DMF disks, or Windows formatted disks . But in
reality, it has already existed years before! Mtools
supports these formats on Linux, on SunOs and on the DELL
Unix PC.</p>

<p>Bigger sectors By using bigger sectors it is possible to
go beyond the capacity which can be obtained by the standard
512-byte sectors. This is because of the sector header. The
sector header has the same size, regardless of how many data
bytes are in the sector. Thus, we save some space by using
fewer, but bigger sectors. For example, 1 sector of 4K only
takes up header space once, whereas 8 sectors of 512 bytes
have also 8 head- ers, for the same amount of useful
data.</p>

<p>This method allows to store up to 1992K on a 3 1/2 HD
disk.</p>

<p>Mtools supports these formats only on Linux.</p>

<p>2m The 2m format was originally invented by Ciriaco
Garcia de Celis. It also uses bigger sectors than usual in
order to fit more data on the disk. However, it uses the
standard format (18 sectors of 512 bytes each) on the first
cylinder, in order to make these disks easyer to handle by
DOS. Indeed this method allows to have a standard sized
boot- sector, which contains a description of how the rest
of the disk should be read.</p>

<p>However, the drawback of this is that the first cylinder
can hold less data than the others. Unfortunately, DOS can
only handle disks where each track contains the same amount
of data. Thus 2m hides the fact that the first track
contains less data by using a shadow FAT. (Usu- ally, DOS
stores the FAT in two identical copies, for additional
safety. XDF stores only one copy, and it tells DOS that it
stores two. Thus the same that would be taken up by the
second FAT copy is saved.) This also means that your should
never use a 2m disk to store anything else than a DOS
fs.</p>

<p>Mtools supports these format only on Linux.</p>

<p>XDF XDF is a high capacity format used by OS/2. It can
hold 1840 K per disk. That s lower than the best 2m formats,
but its main advantage is that it is fast: 600 milliseconds
per track. Thats faster than the 21 sector format, and
almost as fast as the standard 18 sector format. In order to
access these disks, make sure mtools has been compiled with
XDF support, and set the use_xdf variable for the drive in
the configu- ration file. See section Compiling mtools, and
misc variables, for details on how to do this. Fast XDF
access is only available for Linux kernels which are more
recent than 1.1.34.</p>

<p>Mtools supports this format only on Linux.</p>

<p>Caution / Attention distributors: If mtools is compiled
on a Linux ker- nel more recent than 1.3.34, it wont run on
an older kernel. However, if it has been compiled on an
older kernel, it still runs on a newer kernel, except that
XDF access is slower. It is recommended that dis- tribution
authors only include mtools binaries compiled on kernels
older than 1.3.34 until 2.0 comes out. When 2.0 will be out,
mtools binaries compiled on newer kernels may (and should)
be distributed. Mtools binaries compiled on kernels older
than 1.3.34 wont run on any 2.1 kernel or later.</p>

<p>Exit codes All the Mtools commands return 0 on success,
1 on utter failure, or 2 on partial failure. All the Mtools
commands perform a few sanity checks before going ahead, to
make sure that the disk is indeed an MS- DOS disk (as
opposed to, say an ext2 or minix disk). These checks may
reject partially corrupted disks, which might otherwise
still be read- able. To avoid these checks, set the
MTOOLS_SKIP_CHECK environmental variable or the
corresponding configuration file variable (see section
global variables)</p>

<p>Bugs An unfortunate side effect of not guessing the
proper device (when mul- tiple disk capacities are
supported) is an occasional error message from the device
driver. These can be safely ignored.</p>

<p>The fat checking code chokes on 1.72 Mb disks mformatted
with pre-2.0.7 mtools. Set the environmental variable
MTOOLS_FAT_COMPATIBILITY (or the corresponding configuration
file variable, global variables) to bypass the fat
checking.</p>
