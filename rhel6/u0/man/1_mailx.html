<p>MAILX(1) User Commands MAILX(1)</p>

<p>NAME mailx - send and receive Internet mail</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS mailx [-BDdEFintv~] [-s subject] [-a attachment
] [-c cc-addr] [-b bcc- addr] [-r from-addr] [-h hops] [-A
account] [-S vari- able[=value]] to-addr . . . mailx
[-BDdeEHiInNRv~] [-T name] [-A account] [-S
variable[=value]] -f [name] mailx [-BDdeEinNRv~] [-A
account] [-S variable[=value]] [-u user]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Mailx is an intelligent mail processing
system, which has a command syntax reminiscent of ed(1) with
lines replaced by messages. It is based on Berkeley Mail
8.1, is intended to provide the functionality of the POSIX
mailx command, and offers extensions for MIME, IMAP, POP3,
SMTP, and S/MIME. Mailx provides enhanced features for
interactive use, such as caching and disconnected operation
for IMAP, message threading, scoring, and filtering. It is
also usable as a mail batch language, both for sending and
receiving mail.</p>

<p>The following options are accepted:</p>

<p>-A name Executes an account command (see below) for name
after the startup files have been read.</p>

<p>-a file Attach the given file to the message.</p>

<p>-B Make standard input and standard output
line-buffered.</p>

<p>-b address Send blind carbon copies to list. List should
be a comma-sepa- rated list of names.</p>

<p>-c address Send carbon copies to list of users.</p>

<p>-D Start in disconnected mode; see the description for
the discon- nected variable option.</p>

<p>-d Enables debugging messages and disables the actual
delivery of messages. Unlike -v, this option is intended for
mailx develop- ment only.</p>

<p>-e Just check if mail is present in the system mailbox.
If yes, return an exit status of zero, else, a non-zero
value.</p>

<p>-E If an outgoing message does not contain any text in
its first or only message part, do not send it but discard
it silently, effectively setting the skipemptybody variable
at program startup. This is useful for sending messages from
scripts started by cron(8).</p>

<p>-f [file] Read in the contents of the users mbox (or the
specified file) for processing; when mailx is quit, it
writes undeleted messages back to this file. The string file
is handled as described for the folder command below.</p>

<p>-F Save the message to send in a file named after the
local part of the first recipients address.</p>

<p>-H Print header summaries for all messages and exit.</p>

<p>-h hops Invoke sendmail with the specified hop count.
This option has no effect when SMTP is used for sending
mail.</p>

<p>-i Ignore tty interrupt signals. This is particularly
useful when using mailx on noisy phone lines.</p>

<p>-I Shows the Newsgroup: or Article-Id: fields in the
header summary. Only applicable in combination with -f.</p>

<p>-n Inhibits reading /etc/mail.rc upon startup. This
option should be activated for mailx scripts that are
invoked on more than one machine, because the contents of
that file may differ between them.</p>

<p>-N Inhibits the initial display of message headers when
reading mail or editing a mail folder.</p>

<p>-q file Start the message with the contents of the
specified file. May be given in send mode only.</p>

<p>-r address Sets the From address. Overrides any from
variable specified in environment or startup files. Tilde
escapes are disabled. The -r address options are passed to
the mail transfer agent unless SMTP is used. This option
exists for compatibility only; it is recommended to set the
from variable directly instead.</p>

<p>-R Opens any folders read-only.</p>

<p>-s subject Specify subject on command line (only the
first argument after the -s flag is used as a subject; be
careful to quote subjects containing spaces).</p>

<p>-S variable[=value] Sets the internal option variable
and, in case of a string option, assigns value to it.</p>

<p>-T name Writes the Message-Id: and Article-Id: header
fields of each message read in the file name. Implies -I.
Compressed files are handled as described for the folder
command below.</p>

<p>-t The message to be sent is expected to contain a
message header with To: , Cc:, or Bcc: fields giving its
recipients. Recipients specified on the command line are
ignored.</p>

<p>-u user Reads the mailbox of the given user name.</p>

<p>-v Verbose mode. The details of delivery are displayed
on the users terminal.</p>

<p>-V Print mailxs version and exit.</p>

<p>-~ Enable tilde escapes even if not in interactive
mode.</p>

<p>Sending mail To send a message to one or more people,
mailx can be invoked with arguments which are the names of
people to whom the mail will be sent. The user is then
expected to type in his message, followed by an con- trol-D
at the beginning of a line. The section below Replying to or
originating mail, describes some features of mailx available
to help when composing letters.</p>

<p>Reading mail In normal usage mailx is given no arguments
and checks the users mail out of the post office, then
prints out a one line header of each mes- sage found. The
current message is initially the first message (num- bered
1) and can be printed using the print command which can be
abbre- viated p). The user can move among the messages much
as he moves between lines in ed(1), with the commands + and
- moving backwards and forwards, and simple numbers.</p>

<p>Disposing of mail After examining a message the user can
delete d ) the message or reply r ) to it. Deletion causes
the mailx program to forget about the mes- sage. This is not
irreversible; the message can be undeleted u) by giving its
number, or the mailx session can be aborted by giving the
exit x) command. Deleted messages will, however, usually
disappear never to be seen again.</p>

<p>Specifying messages Commands such as print and delete
can be given a list of message num- bers as arguments to
apply to a number of messages at once. Thus delete 1 2
deletes messages 1 and 2, while delete 1-5 deletes mes-
sages 1 through 5. In sorted or threaded mode (see the sort
and thread commands), delete 1-5 deletes the messages that
are located between (and including) messages 1 through 5 in
the sorted/threaded order, as shown in the header summary.
The following special message names exist:</p>

<p>:n All new messages.</p>

<p>:o All old messages (any not in state read or new).</p>

<p>:u All unread messages.</p>

<p>:d All deleted messages (for the undelete command).</p>

<p>:r All read messages.</p>

<p>:f All flagged messages.</p>

<p>:a All answered messages (cf. the markanswered
variable).</p>

<p>:t All messages marked as draft.</p>

<p>:k All killed messages.</p>

<p>:j All messages classified as junk.</p>

<p>. The current message.</p>

<p>; The message that was previously the current
message.</p>

<p>, The parent message of the current message, that is the
message with the Message-ID given in the In-Reply-To: field
or the last entry of the References: field of the current
message.</p>

<p>- The next previous undeleted message, or the next
previous deleted message for the undelete command. In
sorted/threaded mode, the next previous such message in the
sorted/threaded order.</p>

<p>+ The next undeleted message, or the next deleted
message for the undelete command. In sorted/threaded mode,
the next such mes- sage in the sorted/threaded order.</p>

<p>^ The first undeleted message, or the first deleted
message for the undelete command. In sorted/threaded mode,
the first such message in the sorted/threaded order.</p>

<p>$ The last message. In sorted/threaded mode, the last
message in the sorted/threaded order.</p>

<p>&amp;x In threaded mode, selects the message addressed
with x, where x is any other message specification, and all
messages from the thread that begins at it. Otherwise, it is
identical to x. If x is omitted, the thread beginning with
the current message is selected.</p>

<p>* All messages.</p>

<p>All messages that were included in the message list for
the pre- vious command.</p>

<p>/string All messages that contain string in the subject
field (case ignored). See also the searchheaders variable.
If string is empty, the string from the previous
specification of that type is used again.</p>

<p>address All messages from address.</p>

<p>(criterion) All messages that satisfy the given
IMAP-style SEARCH criterion. This addressing mode is
available with all types of folders; for folders not located
on IMAP servers, or for servers unable to execute the SEARCH
command, mailx will perform the search locally. Strings must
be enclosed by double quotes &quot; in their entirety if
they contain white space or parentheses; within the quotes,
only backslash is recognized as an escape character. All
string searches are case-insensitive. When the description
indicates that the envelope representation of an address
field is used, this means that the search string is checked
against both a list constructed as</p>

<p>(&quot;real name&quot; &quot;source-route&quot;
&quot;local-part&quot; &quot;domain-part&quot;)</p>

<p>for each address, and the addresses without real names
from the respective header field. Criteria can be nested
using parenthe- ses.</p>

<p>(criterion1 criterion2 ... criterionN) All messages that
satisfy all of the given criteria.</p>

<p>(or criterion1 criterion2) All messages that satisfy
either criterion1 or criterion2, or both. To connect more
than two criteria using or , (or) speci- fications have to
be nested using additional parentheses, as with (or a (or b
c)); (or a b c) means ((a or b) and c). For a simple or
operation of independent criteria on the low- est nesting
level, it is possible to achieve similar effects by using
three separate criteria, as with (a) (b) (c).</p>

<p>(not criterion) All messages that do not satisfy
criterion.</p>

<p>(bcc string) All messages that contain string in the
envelope representa- tion of the Bcc: field.</p>

<p>(cc string) All messages that contain string in the
envelope representa- tion of the Cc: field.</p>

<p>(from string) All messages that contain string in the
envelope representa- tion of the From: field.</p>

<p>(subject string) All messages that contain string in the
Subject: field.</p>

<p>(to string) All messages that contain string in the
envelope representa- tion of the To: field.</p>

<p>(header name string) All messages that contain string in
the specified Name: field.</p>

<p>(body string) All messages that contain string in their
body.</p>

<p>(text string) All messages that contain string in their
header or body.</p>

<p>(larger size) All messages that are larger than size (in
bytes).</p>

<p>(smaller size) All messages that are smaller than size
(in bytes).</p>

<p>(before date) All messages that were received before
date; date must be in the form d[d]-mon-yyyy, where d[d] is
the day of the month as one or two digits, mon is the name
of the monthone of Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug,
Sep, Oct, Nov, or Dec, and yyyy is the year as four digits;
e.g. &quot;30-Aug-2004&quot;.</p>

<p>(on date) All messages that were received on the
specified date.</p>

<p>(since date) All messages that were received since the
specified date.</p>

<p>(sentbefore date) All messages that were sent on the
specified date.</p>

<p>(senton date) All messages that were sent on the
specified date.</p>

<p>(sentsince date) All messages that were sent since the
specified date.</p>

<p>() The same criterion as for the previous search. This
specifica- tion cannot be used as part of another criterion.
If the previ- ous command line contained more than one
independent criterion, the last of those criteria is
used.</p>

<p>A practical method to read a set of messages is to issue
a from command with the search criteria first to check for
appropriate messages, and to read each single message then
by typing repeatedly.</p>

<p>Replying to or originating mail The reply command can be
used to set up a response to a message, send- ing it back to
the person who it was from. Text the user types in then, up
to an end-of-file, defines the contents of the message.
While the user is composing a message, mailx treats lines
beginning with the character ~ specially. For instance,
typing ~m (alone on a line) will place a copy of the current
message into the response right shift- ing it by a tabstop
(see indentprefix variable, below). Other escapes will set
up subject fields, add and delete recipients to the message,
attach files to it and allow the user to escape to an editor
to revise the message or to a shell to run some commands.
(These options are given in the summary below.)</p>

<p>Ending a mail processing session The user can end a
mailx session with the quit (q) command. Messages which have
been examined go to the user s mbox file unless they have
been deleted in which case they are discarded. Unexamined
messages go back to the post office. (See the -f option
above).</p>

<p>Personal and systemwide distribution lists It is also
possible to create a personal distribution lists so that,
for instance, the user can send mail to cohorts and have it
go to a group of people. Such lists can be defined by
placing a line like</p>

<p>alias cohorts bill ozalp jkf mark kridle@ucbcory</p>

<p>in the file .mailrc in the users home directory. The
current list of such aliases can be displayed with the alias
command in mailx. System wide distribution lists can be
created by editing /etc/aliases, see aliases(5) and
sendmail(8); these are kept in a different syntax. In mail
the user sends, personal aliases will be expanded in mail
sent to others so that they will be able to reply to the
recipients. System wide aliases are not expanded when the
mail is sent, but any reply returned to the machine will
have the system wide alias expanded as all mail goes through
sendmail.</p>

<p>Recipient address specifications When an address is used
to name a recipient (in any of To, Cc, or Bcc), names of
local mail folders and pipes to external commands can also
be specified; the message text is then written to them. The
rules are: Any name which starts with a | character
specifies a pipe, the com- mand string following the | is
executed and the message is sent to its standard input; any
other name which contains a @ character is treated as a mail
address; any other name which starts with a + char- acter
specifies a folder name; any other name which contains a /
character but no ! or % character before also specifies a
folder name; what remains is treated as a mail address.
Compressed folders are handled as described for the folder
command below.</p>

<p>Network mail (Internet / ARPA, UUCP, Berknet) See
mailaddr(7) for a description of network addresses. Mailx
has a number of options which can be set in the .mailrc file
to alter its behavior; thus set askcc enables the askcc
feature. (These options are summarized below).</p>

<p>MIME types For any outgoing attachment, mailx tries to
determine the content type. It does this by reading MIME
type files whose lines have the following syntax:</p>

<p>type/subtype extension [extension . . .]</p>

<p>where type/subtype are strings describing the file
contents, and exten- sion is the part of a filename starting
after the last dot. Any line not immediately beginning with
an ASCII alphabetical character is ignored by mailx. If
there is a match with the extension of the file to attach,
the given type/subtype pair is used. Otherwise, or if the
filename has no extension, the content types text/plain or
applica- tion/octet-stream are used, the first for text or
international text files, the second for any file that
contains formatting characters other than newlines and
horizontal tabulators.</p>

<p>Character sets Mailx normally detects the character set
of the terminal using the LC_CTYPE locale setting. If the
locale cannot be used appropriately, the ttycharset variable
should be set to provide an explicit value. When reading
messages, their text is converted to the terminal character
set if possible. Unprintable characters and illegal byte
sequences are detected and replaced by Unicode substitute
characters or question marks unless the print-all-chars is
set at initialization time.</p>

<p>The character set for outgoing messages is not
necessarily the same as the one used on the terminal. If an
outgoing text message contains characters not representable
in US-ASCII, the character set being used must be declared
within its header. Permissible values can be declared using
the sendcharsets variable, separated by commas; mailx tries
each of the values in order and uses the first appropriate
one. If the mes- sage contains characters that cannot be
represented in any of the given character sets, the message
will not be sent, and its text will be saved to the
dead.letter file. Messages that contain NUL bytes are not
converted.</p>

<p>Outgoing attachments are converted if they are plain
text. If the sendcharsets variable contains more than one
character set name, the ~@ tilde escape will ask for the
character sets for individual attachments if it is invoked
without arguments.</p>

<p>Best results are usually achieved when mailx is run in a
UTF-8 locale on a UTF-8 capable terminal. In this setup,
characters from various countries can be displayed, while it
is still possible to use more sim- ple character sets for
sending to retain maximum compatibility with older mail
clients.</p>

<p>Commands Each command is typed on a line by itself, and
may take arguments fol- lowing the command word. The command
need not be typed in its entirety the first command which
matches the typed prefix is used. For com- mands which take
message lists as arguments, if no message list is given,
then the next message forward which satisfies the commands
requirements is used. If there are no messages forward of
the current message, the search proceeds backwards, and if
there are no good mes- sages at all, mailx types applicable
messages and aborts the command. If the command begins with
a # sign, the line is ignored.</p>

<p>The arguments to commands can be quoted, using the
following methods:</p>

<p>&middot; An argument can be enclosed between paired
double-quotes &quot;&quot; or single-quotes ; any white
space, shell word expansion, or backslash characters within
the quotes are treated literally as part of the argument. A
double-quote will be treated literally within single-quotes
and vice versa. These special properties of the quote marks
occur only when they are paired at the beginning and end of
the argument.</p>

<p>&middot; A backslash outside of the enclosing quotes is
discarded and the following character is treated literally
as part of the argu- ment.</p>

<p>&middot; An unquoted backslash at the end of a command
line is discarded and the next line continues the
command.</p>

<p>Filenames, where expected, are subjected to the
following transforma- tions, in sequence:</p>

<p>&middot; If the filename begins with an unquoted plus
sign, and the folder variable is defined, the plus sign will
be replaced by the value of the folder variable followed by
a slash. If the folder variable is unset or is set to null,
the filename will be unchanged.</p>

<p>&middot; Shell word expansions are applied to the
filename. If more than a single pathname results from this
expansion and the command is expecting one file, an error
results.</p>

<p>The following commands are provided:</p>

<p>- Print out the preceding message. If given a numeric
argument n, goes to the nth previous message and prints
it.</p>

<p>? Prints a brief summary of commands.</p>

<p>! Executes the shell (see sh(1) and csh(1)) command
which follows.</p>

<p>| A synonym for the pipe command.</p>

<p>account (ac) Creates, selects or lists an email account.
An account is formed by a group of commands, primarily of
those to set vari- ables. With two arguments, of which the
second is a {, the first argument gives an account name, and
the following lines create a group of commands for that
account until a line con- taining a single } appears. With
one argument, the previously created group of commands for
the account name is executed, and a folder command is
executed for the system mailbox or inbox of that account.
Without arguments, the list of accounts and their contents
are printed. As an example,</p>

<p>account myisp { set
folder=imaps://mylogin@imap.myisp.example set record=+Sent
set from=&quot;myname@myisp.example (My Name)&quot; set
smtp=smtp.myisp.example }</p>

<p>creates an account named myisp which can later be
selected by specifying account myisp.</p>

<p>alias (a) With no arguments, prints out all
currently-defined aliases. With one argument, prints out
that alias. With more than one argument, creates a new alias
or changes an old one.</p>

<p>alternates (alt) The alternates command is useful if the
user has accounts on several machines. It can be used to
inform mailx that the listed addresses all belong to the
invoking user. When he replies to messages, mailx will not
send a copy of the message to any of the addresses listed on
the alternates list. If the alternates command is given with
no argument, the current set of alternate names is
displayed.</p>

<p>answered (ans) Takes a message list and marks each
message as a having been answered. This mark has no
technical meaning in the mail system; it just causes
messages to be marked in the header sum- mary, and makes
them specially addressable.</p>

<p>cache Only applicable to cached IMAP mailboxes; takes a
message list and reads the specified messages into the IMAP
cache.</p>

<p>call Calls a macro (see the define command).</p>

<p>cd Same as chdir.</p>

<p>certsave Only applicable to S/MIME signed messages.
Takes a message list and a file name and saves the
certificates contained within the message signatures to the
named file in both human-readable and PEM format. The
certificates can later be used to send encrypted messages to
the messages originators by setting the
smime-encrypt-user@host variable.</p>

<p>chdir (ch) Changes the users working directory to that
specified, if given. If no directory is given, then changes
to the users login directory.</p>

<p>classify (cl) Takes a list of messages and examines
their contents for characteristics of junk mail using
Bayesian filtering. Messages considered to be junk are then
marked as such. The junk mail database is not changed.</p>

<p>collapse (coll) Only applicable to threaded mode. Takes
a message list and makes all replies to these messages
invisible in header sum- maries, unless they are in state
new.</p>

<p>connect (conn) If operating in disconnected mode on an
IMAP mailbox, switch to online mode and connect to the mail
server while retaining the mailbox status. See the
description of the dis- connected variable for more
information.</p>

<p>copy (c) The copy command does the same thing that save
does, except that it does not mark the messages it is used
on for deletion when the user quits. Compressed files and
IMAP mailboxes are handled as described for the folder
command.</p>

<p>Copy (C) Similar to copy, but saves the messages in a
file named after the local part of the sender address of the
first message.</p>

<p>decrypt (dec) For unencrypted messages, this command is
identical to copy. Encrypted messages are first decrypted,
if possible, and then copied.</p>

<p>Decrypt (Dec) Similar to decrypt, but saves the messages
in a file named after the local part of the sender address
of the first message.</p>

<p>define (def) Defines a macro. A macro definition is a
sequence of com- mands in the following form:</p>

<p>define name { command1 command2 ... commandN }</p>

<p>Once defined, a macro can be explicitly invoked using
the call command, or can be implicitly invoked by setting
the folder-hook or folder-hook-fullname variables.</p>

<p>defines Prints the currently defined macros including
their contents.</p>

<p>delete (d) Takes a list of messages as argument and
marks them all as deleted. Deleted messages will not be
saved in mbox, nor will they be available for most other
commands.</p>

<p>discard Same as ignore.</p>

<p>disconnect (disco) If operating in online mode on an
IMAP mailbox, switch to disconnected mode while retaining
the mailbox status. See the description of the disconnected
variable for more informa- tion. A list of messages may
optionally be given as argument; the respective messages are
then read into the cache before the connection is closed.
Thus disco * makes the entire current mailbox available for
disconnected use.</p>

<p>dp or dt Deletes the current message and prints the next
message. If there is no next message, mailx says at EOF.</p>

<p>draft Takes a message list and marks each message as a
draft. This mark has no technical meaning in the mail
system; it just causes messages to be marked in the header
summary, and makes them spe- cially addressable.</p>

<p>echo Echoes its arguments, resolving special names as
documented for b the folder command. The escape
sequencea,,rt,,, and0num are interpreted f,n, as with the
echo(1) command.</p>

<p>edit (e) Takes a list of messages and points the text
editor at each one in turn. Modified contents are discarded
unless the write- backedited variable is set.</p>

<p>else Marks the end of the then-part of an if statement
and the begin- ning of the part to take effect if the
condition of the if statement is false.</p>

<p>endif Marks the end of an if statement.</p>

<p>exit (ex or x) Effects an immediate return to the Shell
without modi- fying the users system mailbox, his mbox file,
or his edit file in -f.</p>

<p>file (fi) The same as folder.</p>

<p>flag (fl) Takes a message list and marks the messages as
flagged for urgent/special attention. This mark has no
technical mean- ing in the mail system; it just causes
messages to be high- lighted in the header summary, and
makes them specially address- able.</p>

<p>folders With no arguments, list the names of the folders
in the folder directory. With an existing folder as an
argument, lists then names of folders below the named
folder; e.g. the command fold- ers @ lists the folders on
the base level of the current IMAP server. See also the
imap-list-depth variable.</p>

<p>folder (fold) The folder command switches to a new mail
file or folder. With no arguments, it tells the user which
file he is currently reading. If an argument is given, it
will write out changes (such as deletions) the user has made
in the current file and read in the new file. Some special
conventions are recognized for the name. # means the
previous file, % means the invoking users system mailbox,
%user means users system mailbox, &amp; means the invoking
users mbox file, and +file means a file in the folder
directory. %:filespec expands to the same value as filespec,
but the file is handled as a system mailbox e. g. by the
mbox and save commands. If the name matches one of the
strings defined with the shortcut command, it is replaced by
its long form and expanded. If the name ends with .gz or
.bz2, it is treated as compressed with gzip(1) or bzip2(1),
respectively. Likewise, if name does not exist, but either
name.gz or name.bz2 exists, the compressed file is used. If
name refers to a direc- tory with the subdirectories tmp,
new, and cur , it is treated as a folder in maildir format.
A name of the form</p>

<p>protocol://[user@]host[:port][/file]</p>

<p>is taken as an Internet mailbox specification. The
supported protocols are currently imap (IMAP v4r1), imaps
(IMAP with SSL/TLS encryption), pop3 (POP3), and pop3s (POP3
with SSL/TLS encryption). If user contains special
characters, in particular / or %, they must be escaped in
URL notation, as %2F or %25 . The optional file part applies
to IMAP only; if it is omitted, the default INBOX is used.
If mailx is connected to an IMAP server, a name of the form
@mailbox refers to the mail- box on that server. If the
folder variable refers to an IMAP account, the special name
% selects the INBOX on that account.</p>

<p>Followup (F) Similar to Respond, but saves the message
in a file named after the local part of the first recipients
address.</p>

<p>followup (fo) Similar to respond, but saves the message
in a file named after the local part of the first recipients
address.</p>

<p>followupall Similar to followup, but responds to all
recipients regardless of the flipr and Replyall
variables.</p>

<p>followupsender Similar to Followup, but responds to the
sender only regardless of the flipr and Replyall
variables.</p>

<p>forward (fwd) Takes a message and the address of a
recipient and for- wards the message to him. The text of the
original message is included in the new one, with the value
of the fwdheading vari- able printed before. The fwdignore
and fwdretain commands spec- ify which header fields are
included in the new message. Only the first part of a
multipart message is included unless the
forward-as-attachment option is set.</p>

<p>Forward (Fwd) Similar to forward, but saves the message
in a file named after the local part of the recipients
address.</p>

<p>from (f) Takes a list of messages and prints their
message headers, piped through the pager if the output does
not fit on the screen.</p>

<p>fwdignore Specifies which header fields are to be
ignored with the forward command. This command has no effect
when the forward-as-attach- ment option is set.</p>

<p>fwdretain Specifies which header fields are to be
retained with the for- ward command. fwdretain overrides
fwdignore. This command has no effect when the
forward-as-attachment option is set.</p>

<p>good (go) Takes a list of messages and marks all of them
as not being junk mail. Data from these messages is then
inserted into the junk mail database for future
classification.</p>

<p>headers (h) Lists the current range of headers, which is
an 18-message group. If a + argument is given, then the next
18-message group is printed, and if a - argument is given,
the previous 18-message group is printed.</p>

<p>help A synonym for ?.</p>

<p>hold (ho, also preserve) Takes a message list and marks
each message therein to be saved in the users system mailbox
instead of in mbox. Does not override the delete command.
mailx deviates from the POSIX standard with this command, as
a next command issued after hold will display the following
message, not the current one.</p>

<p>if Commands in mailxs startup files can be executed
conditionally depending on whether the user is sending or
receiving mail with the if command. For example:</p>

<p>if receive commands . . . endif</p>

<p>An else form is also available:</p>

<p>if receive commands . . . else commands . . . endif</p>

<p>Note that the only allowed conditions are receive, send,
and term (execute command if standard input is a tty).</p>

<p>ignore Add the list of header fields named to the
ignored list. Header fields in the ignore list are not
printed on the terminal when a message is printed. This
command is very handy for suppression of certain
machine-generated header fields. The Type and Print commands
can be used to print a message in its entirety, includ- ing
ignored fields. If ignore is executed with no arguments, it
lists the current set of ignored fields.</p>

<p>imap Sends command strings directly to the current IMAP
server. Mailx operates always in IMAP selected state on the
current mailbox; commands that change this will produce
undesirable results and should be avoided. Useful IMAP
commands are:</p>

<p>create Takes the name of an IMAP mailbox as an argument
and cre- ates it.</p>

<p>getquotaroot Takes the name of an IMAP mailbox as an
argument and prints the quotas that apply to the mailbox.
Not all IMAP servers support this command.</p>

<p>namespace Takes no arguments and prints the Personal
Namespaces, the Other Users Namespaces, and the Shared
Namespaces. Each namespace type is printed in parentheses;
if there are multiple namespaces of the same type, inner
parenthe- ses separate them. For each namespace, a namespace
pre- fix and a hierarchy separator is listed. Not all IMAP
servers support this command.</p>

<p>inc Same as newmail.</p>

<p>junk (j) Takes a list of messages and marks all of them
as junk mail. Data from these messages is then inserted into
the junk mail database for future classification.</p>

<p>kill (k) Takes a list of messages and kills them. Killed
messages are not printed in header summaries, and are
ignored by the next command. The kill command also sets the
score of the messages to negative infinity, so that
subsequent score commands will not unkill them again.
Killing is only effective for the current session on a
folder; when it is quit, all messages are automati- cally
unkilled.</p>

<p>list Prints the names of all available commands.</p>

<p>Mail (M) Similar to mail, but saves the message in a
file named after the local part of the first recipients
address.</p>

<p>mail (m) Takes as argument login names and distribution
group names and sends mail to those people.</p>

<p>mbox Indicate that a list of messages be sent to mbox in
the users home directory when mailx is quit. This is the
default action for messages if unless the hold option is
set. mailx deviates from the POSIX standard with this
command, as a next command issued after mbox will display
the following message, not the current one.</p>

<p>move (mv) Acts like copy, but marks the messages for
deletion if they were transferred successfully.</p>

<p>Move (Mv) Similar to move, but moves the messages to a
file named after the local part of the sender address of the
first message.</p>

<p>newmail Checks for new mail in the current folder
without committing any changes before. If new mail is
present, a message is printed. If the header variable is
set, the headers of each new message are also printed.</p>

<p>next (n) like + or CR) Goes to the next message in
sequence and types it. With an argument list, types the next
matching message.</p>

<p>New Same as unread.</p>

<p>new Same as unread.</p>

<p>online Same as connect.</p>

<p>noop If the current folder is located on an IMAP or POP3
server, a NOOP command is sent. Otherwise, no operation is
performed.</p>

<p>Pipe (Pi) Like pipe but also pipes ignored header fields
and all parts of MIME multipart/alternative messages.</p>

<p>pipe (pi) Takes a message list and a shell command and
pipes the mes- sages through the command. Without an
argument, the current message is piped through the command
given by the cmd variable. If the page variable is set,
every message is followed by a formfeed character.</p>

<p>preserve (pre) A synonym for hold.</p>

<p>Print (P) Like print but also prints out ignored header
fields and all parts of MIME multipart/alternative messages.
See also print, ignore, and retain.</p>

<p>print (p) Takes a message list and types out each
message on the users terminal. If the message is a MIME
multipart message, all parts with a content type of text or
message are shown, the other are hidden except for their
headers. Messages are decrypted and converted to the
terminal character set if neces- sary.</p>

<p>probability (prob) For each word given as argument, the
contents of its junk mail database entry are printed.</p>

<p>quit (q) Terminates the session, saving all undeleted,
unsaved mes- sages in the user s mbox file in his login
directory, preserving all messages marked with hold or
preserve or never referenced in his system mailbox, and
removing all other messages from his system mailbox. If new
mail has arrived during the session, the message You have
new mail is given. If given while editing a mailbox file
with the -f flag, then the edit file is rewritten. A return
to the Shell is effected, unless the rewrite of edit file
fails, in which case the user can escape with the exit com-
mand.</p>

<p>redirect (red) Same as resend.</p>

<p>Redirect (Red) Same as Resend.</p>

<p>remove (rem) Removes the named folders. The user is
asked for confir- mation in interactive mode.</p>

<p>rename (ren) Takes the name of an existing folder and
the name for the new folder and renames the first to the
second one. Both fold- ers must be of the same type and must
be located on the current server for IMAP.</p>

<p>Reply (R) Reply to originator. Does not reply to other
recipients of the original message.</p>

<p>reply (r) Takes a message list and sends mail to the
sender and all recipients of the specified message. The
default message must not be deleted.</p>

<p>replyall Similar to reply, but responds to all
recipients regardless of the flipr and Replyall
variables.</p>

<p>replysender Similar to Reply, but responds to the sender
only regardless of the flipr and Replyall variables.</p>

<p>Resend Like resend, but does not add any header lines.
This is not a way to hide the senders identity, but useful
for sending a mes- sage again to the same recipients.</p>

<p>resend Takes a list of messages and a user name and
sends each message to the named user. Resent-From: and
related header fields are prepended to the new copy of the
message.</p>

<p>Respond Same as Reply.</p>

<p>respond Same as reply.</p>

<p>respondall Same as replyall.</p>

<p>respondsender Same as replysender.</p>

<p>retain Add the list of header fields named to the
retained list. Only the header fields in the retain list are
shown on the terminal when a message is printed. All other
header fields are sup- pressed. The Type and Print commands
can be used to print a message in its entirety. If retain is
executed with no argu- ments, it lists the current set of
retained fields.</p>

<p>Save (S) Similar to save, but saves the messages in a
file named after the local part of the sender of the first
message instead of taking a filename argument.</p>

<p>save (s) Takes a message list and a filename and appends
each message in turn to the end of the file. If no filename
is given, the mbox file is used. The filename in quotes,
followed by the line count and character count is echoed on
the user s terminal. If editing a system mailbox, the
messages are marked for deletion. Compressed files and IMAP
mailboxes are handled as described for the -f command line
option above.</p>

<p>savediscard Same as saveignore.</p>

<p>saveignore Saveignore is to save what ignore is to print
and type. Header fields thus marked are filtered out when
saving a message by save or when automatically saving to
mbox. This command should only be applied to header fields
that do not contain information needed to decode the
message, as MIME content fields do. If saving messages on an
IMAP account, ignoring fields makes it impossible to copy
the data directly on the server, thus opera- tion usually
becomes much slower.</p>

<p>saveretain Saveretain is to save what retain is to print
and type. Header fields thus marked are the only ones saved
with a message when saving by save or when automatically
saving to mbox. Saveretain overrides saveignore. The use of
this command is strongly dis- couraged since it may strip
header fields that are needed to decode the message
correctly.</p>

<p>score (sc) Takes a message list and a floating point
number and adds the number to the score of each given
message. All messages start at score 0 when a folder is
opened. When the score of a message becomes negative, it is
killed with the effects described for the kill command;
otherwise if it was negative before and becomes positive, it
is unkilled . Scores only refer to the currently opened
instance of a folder.</p>

<p>set (se) With no arguments, prints all variable values,
piped through the pager if the output does not fit on the
screen. Otherwise, sets option. Arguments are of the form
option=value (no space before or after =) or option.
Quotation marks may be placed around any part of the
assignment statement to quote blanks or tabs, i.e. set
indentprefix=&quot;-&gt;&quot;. If an argument begins with
no, as in set nosave, the effect is the same as invoking the
unset command with the remaining part of the vari- able
(unset save).</p>

<p>seen Takes a message list and marks all messages as
having been read.</p>

<p>shell (sh) Invokes an interactive version of the
shell.</p>

<p>shortcut Defines a shortcut name and its string for
expansion, as described for the folder command. With no
arguments, a list of defined shortcuts is printed.</p>

<p>show (Sh) Like print, but performs neither MIME decoding
nor decryp- tion so that the raw message text is shown.</p>

<p>size Takes a message list and prints out the size in
characters of each message.</p>

<p>sort Create a sorted representation of the current
folder, and change the next command and the addressing modes
such that they refer to messages in the sorted order.
Message numbers are the same as in regular mode. If the
header variable is set, a header summary in the new order is
also printed. Possible sorting cri- teria are:</p>

<p>date Sort the messages by their Date: field, that is by
the time they were sent.</p>

<p>from Sort messages by the value of their From: field,
that is by the address of the sender. If the showname vari-
able is set, the senders real name (if any) is used.</p>

<p>size Sort the messages by their size.</p>

<p>score Sort the messages by their score.</p>

<p>status Sort the messages by their message status (new,
read, old, etc.).</p>

<p>subject Sort the messages by their subject.</p>

<p>thread Create a threaded order, as with the thread
command.</p>

<p>to Sort messages by the value of their To: field, that
is by the address of the recipient. If the showname vari-
able is set, the recipients real name (if any) is used.</p>

<p>If no argument is given, the current sorting criterion
is printed.</p>

<p>source The source command reads commands from a
file.</p>

<p>thread (th) Create a threaded representation of the
current folder, i.e. indent messages that are replies to
other messages in the header display, and change the next
command and the addressing modes such that they refer to
messages in the threaded order. Message numbers are the same
as in unthreaded mode. If the header variable is set, a
header summary in threaded order is also printed.</p>

<p>top Takes a message list and prints the top few lines of
each. The number of lines printed is controlled by the
variable toplines and defaults to five.</p>

<p>touch Takes a message list and marks the messages for
saving in the mbox file. mailx deviates from the POSIX
standard with this command, as a next command issued after
mbox will display the following message, not the current
one.</p>

<p>Type (T) Identical to the Print command.</p>

<p>type (t) A synonym for print.</p>

<p>unalias Takes a list of names defined by alias commands
and discards the remembered groups of users. The group names
no longer have any significance.</p>

<p>unanswered Takes a message list and marks each message
as not having been answered.</p>

<p>uncollapse (unc) Only applicable to threaded mode. Takes
a message list and makes the message and all replies to it
visible in header summaries again. When a message becomes
the current message, it is automatically made visible. Also
when a message with col- lapsed replies is printed, all of
these are automatically uncol- lapsed.</p>

<p>undef Undefines each of the named macros. It is not an
error to use a name that does not belong to one of the
currently defined macros.</p>

<p>undelete (u) Takes a message list and marks each message
as not being deleted.</p>

<p>undraft Takes a message list and marks each message as a
draft.</p>

<p>unflag Takes a message list and marks each message as
not being flagged.</p>

<p>unfwdignore Removes the header field names from the list
of ignored fields for the forward command.</p>

<p>unfwdretain Removes the header field names from the list
of retained fields for the forward command.</p>

<p>ungood Takes a message list and undoes the effect of a
good command that was previously applied on exactly these
messages.</p>

<p>unignore Removes the header field names from the list of
ignored fields.</p>

<p>unjunk Takes a message list and undoes the effect of a
junk command that was previously applied on exactly these
messages.</p>

<p>unkill Takes a message list and unkills each message.
Also sets the score of the messages to 0.</p>

<p>Unread Same as unread.</p>

<p>unread (U) Takes a message list and marks each message
as not having been read.</p>

<p>unretain Removes the header field names from the list of
retained fields.</p>

<p>unsaveignore Removes the header field names from the
list of ignored fields for saving.</p>

<p>unsaveretain Removes the header field names from the
list of retained fields for saving.</p>

<p>unset Takes a list of option names and discards their
remembered val- ues; the inverse of set.</p>

<p>unshortcut Deletes the shortcut names given as
arguments.</p>

<p>unsort Disable sorted or threaded mode (see the sort and
thread com- mands), return to normal message order and, if
the header vari- able is set, print a header summary.</p>

<p>unthread (unth) Same as unsort.</p>

<p>verify (verif) Takes a message list and verifies each
message. If a message is not an S/MIME signed message,
verification will fail for it. The verification process
checks if the message was signed using a valid certificate,
if the message senders email address matches one of those
contained within the certificate, and if the message content
has been altered.</p>

<p>visual (v) Takes a message list and invokes the display
editor on each message. Modified contents are discarded
unless the write- backedited variable is set.</p>

<p>write (w) For conventional messages, the body without
all headers is written. The output is decrypted and
converted to its native format, if necessary. If the output
file exists, the text is appended. If a message is in MIME
multipart format, its first part is written to the specified
file as for conventional mes- sages, and the user is asked
for a filename to save each other part; if the contents of
the first part are not to be saved, write /dev/null can be
used. For the second and subsequent parts, if the filename
given starts with a | character, the part is piped through
the remainder of the filename interpreted as a shell
command. In non-interactive mode, only the parts of the
multipart message that have a filename given in the part
header are written, the other are discarded. The original
mes- sage is never marked for deletion in the originating
mail folder. For attachments, the contents of the
destination file are overwritten if the file previously
existed. No special han- dling of compressed files is
performed.</p>

<p>xit (x) A synonym for exit.</p>

<p>z Mailx presents message headers in windowfuls as
described under the headers command. The z command scrolls
to the next window of messages. If an argument is given, it
specifies the window to use. A number prefixed by + or -
indicates that the win- dow is calculated in relation to the
current position. A number without a prefix specifies an
absolute window number, and a $ lets mailx scroll to the
last window of messages.</p>

<p>Z Similar to z, but scrolls to the next or previous
window that contains at least one new or flagged
message.</p>

<p>Tilde escapes Here is a summary of the tilde escapes,
which are used when composing messages to perform special
functions. Tilde escapes are only recog- nized at the
beginning of lines. The name tilde escape is somewhat of a
misnomer since the actual escape character can be set by the
option escape.</p>

<p>~!command Execute the indicated shell command, then
return to the message.</p>

<p>~. Same effect as typing the end-of-file character.</p>

<p>~&lt;filename Identical to ~r.</p>

<p>~&lt;!command Command is executed using the shell. Its
standard output is inserted into the message.</p>

<p>~@ [filename . . . ] With no arguments, edit the
attachment list. First, the user can edit all existing
attachment data. If an attachments file name is left empty,
that attachment is deleted from the list. When the end of
the attachment list is reached, mailx will ask for further
attachments, until an empty file name is given. If filename
arguments are specified, all of them are appended to the end
of the attachment list. Filenames which contain white space
can only be specified with the first method (no filename
arguments).</p>

<p>~A Inserts the string contained in the Sign variable
(same as ~i Sign). The escape sequencet (tabulator) and n
(new- line) are understood.</p>

<p>~a Inserts the string contained in the sign variable
(same as ~i sign). The escape sequencet (tabulator) and n
(new- line) are understood.</p>

<p>~bname . . . Add the given names to the list of carbon
copy recipients but do not make the names visible in the Cc:
line ( blind carbon copy).</p>

<p>~cname . . . Add the given names to the list of carbon
copy recipients.</p>

<p>~d Read the file dead.letter from the user s home
directory into the message.</p>

<p>~e Invoke the text editor on the message collected so
far. After the editing session is finished, the user may
continue appending text to the message.</p>

<p>~fmessages Read the named messages into the message
being sent. If no mes- sages are specified, read in the
current message. Message headers currently being ignored (by
the ignore or retain com- mand) are not included. For MIME
multipart messages, only the first printable part is
included.</p>

<p>~Fmessages Identical to ~f, except all message headers
and all MIME parts are included.</p>

<p>~h Edit the message header fields To:, Cc:, Bcc: , and
Sub- ject: by typing each one in turn and allowing the user
to append text to the end or modify the field by using the
current terminal erase and kill characters.</p>

<p>~H Edit the message header fields From:, Reply-To:,
Sender:, and Organization: in the same manner as described
for ~h. The default values for these fields originate from
the from, replyto, and ORGANIZATION variables. If this tilde
command has been used, changing the variables has no effect
on the current message anymore.</p>

<p>~ivariable Insert the value of the specified variable
into the message adding a newline character at the end. If
the variable is unset or empty, the message remains
unaltered. The escape sequences t (tabulator) andn (newline)
are understood.</p>

<p>~mmessages Read the named messages into the message
being sent, indented by a tab or by the value of
indentprefix. If no messages are spec- ified, read the
current message. Message headers currently being ignored (by
the ignore or retain command) are not included. For MIME
multipart messages, only the first printable part is
included.</p>

<p>~Mmessages Identical to ~m, except all message headers
and all MIME parts are included.</p>

<p>~p Print out the message collected so far, prefaced by
the message header fields and followed by the attachment
list, if any. If the message text is longer than the screen
size, it is piped through the pager.</p>

<p>~q Abort the message being sent, copying the message to
dead.let- ter in the users home directory if save is
set.</p>

<p>~rfilename Read the named file into the message.</p>

<p>~sstring Cause the named string to become the current
subject field.</p>

<p>~tname . . . Add the given names to the direct recipient
list.</p>

<p>~v Invoke an alternate editor (defined by the VISUAL
option) on the message collected so far. Usually, the
alternate editor will be a screen editor. After the editor
is quit, the user may resume appending text to the end of
the message.</p>

<p>~wfilename Write the message onto the named file. If the
file exists, the message is appended to it.</p>

<p>~x Same as ~q, except that the message is not saved to
the dead.letter file.</p>

<p>~|command Pipe the message through the command as a
filter. If the com- mand gives no output or terminates
abnormally, retain the origi- nal text of the message. The
command fmt(1) is often used as command to rejustify the
message.</p>

<p>~:mailx-command Execute the given mailx command. Not all
commands, however, are allowed.</p>

<p>~_mailx-command Identical to ~:.</p>

<p>~~string Insert the string of text in the message
prefaced by a single ~. If the escape character has been
changed, that character must be doubled in order to send it
at the beginning of a line.</p>

<p>Variable options Options are controlled via set and
unset commands, see their entries for a syntax description.
An option is also set if it is passed to mailx as part of
the environment (this is not restricted to specific
variables as in the POSIX standard). A value given in a
startup file overrides a value imported from the
environment. Options may be either binary, in which case it
is only significant to see whether they are set or not; or
string, in which case the actual value is of interest.</p>

<p>Binary options The binary options include the
following:</p>

<p>allnet Causes only the local part to be evaluated when
comparing addresses.</p>

<p>append Causes messages saved in mbox to be appended to
the end rather than prepended. This should always be
set.</p>

<p>ask or asksub Causes mailx to prompt for the subject of
each message sent. If the user responds with simply a
newline, no subject field will be sent.</p>

<p>askatend Causes the prompts for Cc: and Bcc: lists to
appear after the message has been edited.</p>

<p>askattach If set, mailx asks for files to attach at the
end of each mes- sage. Responding with a newline indicates
not to include an attachment.</p>

<p>askcc Causes the user to be prompted for additional
carbon copy recip- ients (at the end of each message if
askatend or bsdcompat is set). Responding with a newline
indicates the user s satisfac- tion with the current
list.</p>

<p>askbcc Causes the user to be prompted for additional
blind carbon copy recipients (at the end of each message if
askatend or bsdcompat is set). Responding with a newline
indicates the users satis- faction with the current
list.</p>

<p>asksign Causes the user to be prompted if the message is
to be signed at the end of each message. The smime-sign
variable is ignored when this variable is set.</p>

<p>autocollapse Causes threads to be collapsed
automatically when threaded mode is entered (see the
collapse command).</p>

<p>autoinc Same as newmail.</p>

<p>autoprint Causes the delete command to behave like dp -
thus, after delet- ing a message, the next one will be typed
automatically.</p>

<p>autothread Causes threaded mode (see the thread command)
to be entered automatically when a folder is opened.</p>

<p>bang Enables the substitution of ! by the contents of
the last command line in shell escapes.</p>

<p>bsdannounce Causes automatic display of a header summary
after executing a folder command.</p>

<p>bsdcompat Sets some cosmetical features to traditional
BSD style; has the same affect as setting askatend and all
other variables pre- fixed with bsd, setting prompt to &amp;
, and changing the default pager to more.</p>

<p>bsdflags Changes the letters printed in the first column
of a header sum- mary to traditional BSD style.</p>

<p>bsdheadline Changes the display of columns in a header
summary to tradi- tional BSD style.</p>

<p>bsdmsgs Changes some informational messages to
traditional BSD style.</p>

<p>bsdorder Causes the Subject: field to appear immediately
after the To: field in message headers and with the ~h tilde
command.</p>

<p>bsdset Changes the output format of the set command to
traditional BSD style.</p>

<p>chained-junk-tokens Normally, the Bayesian junk mail
filter bases its classifica- tions on single word tokens
extracted from messages. If this option is set, adjacent
words are combined to pairs, which are then used as
additional tokens. This usually improves the accu- racy of
the filter, but also increases the junk mail database five-
to tenfold.</p>

<p>datefield The date in a header summary is normally the
date of the mailbox From line of the message. If this
variable is set, the date as given in the Date: header field
is used, converted to local time.</p>

<p>debug Prints debugging messages and disables the actual
delivery of messages. Unlike verbose, this option is
intended for mailx development only.</p>

<p>disconnected When an IMAP mailbox is selected and this
variable is set, no connection to the server is initiated.
Instead, data is obtained from the local cache (see
imap-cache). Mailboxes that are not present in the cache and
messages that have not yet entirely been fetched from the
server are not available; to fetch all messages in a mailbox
at once, the command copy * /dev/null can be used while
still in online mode. Changes that are made to IMAP
mailboxes in disconnected mode are queued and committed
later when a connection to that server is opened in online
mode. This procedure is not completely reliable since it
cannot be guaranteed that the IMAP unique identifiers (UIDs)
on the server still match the ones in the cache at that
time. Data is saved to dead.letter when this problem
occurs.</p>

<p>disconnected-user@host The specified account is handled
as described for the discon- nected variable above, but
other accounts are not affected.</p>

<p>dot The binary option dot causes mailx to interpret a
period alone on a line as the terminator of a message the
user is sending.</p>

<p>editheaders When a message is edited while being
composed, its header is included in the editable text. To:,
Cc:, Bcc:, Subject: , From: , Reply-To: , Sender: , and
Organization: fields are accepted within the header, other
fields are ignored.</p>

<p>emptybox If set, an empty mailbox file is not removed.
This may improve the interoperability with other mail user
agents when using a common folder directory.</p>

<p>emptystart If the mailbox is empty, mailx normally
prints _ No mail for user_ and exits immediately. If this
option is set, mailx starts even with an empty mailbox.</p>

<p>flipr Exchanges the Respond with the respond commands
and vice-versa.</p>

<p>forward-as-attachment Original messages are normally
sent as inline text with the for- ward command, and only the
first part of a multipart message is included. With this
option, messages are sent as MIME mes- sage/rfc822
attachments, and all of their parts are included. The
fwdignore and fwdretain options are ignored when the for-
ward-as-attachment option is set.</p>

<p>fullnames When replying to a message, mailx normally
removes the comment parts of email addresses, which by
convention contain the full names of the recipients. If this
variable is set, such strip- ping is not performed, and
comments are retained.</p>

<p>header Causes the header summary to be written at
startup and after commands that affect the number of
messages or the order of mes- sages in the current folder;
enabled by default.</p>

<p>hold This option is used to hold messages in the system
mailbox by default.</p>

<p>ignore Causes interrupt signals from the terminal to be
ignored and echoed as @s.</p>

<p>ignoreeof An option related to dot is ignoreeof which
makes mailx refuse to accept a control-d as the end of a
message. Ignoreeof also applies to mailx command mode.</p>

<p>imap-use-starttls Causes mailx to issue a STARTTLS
command to make an unencrypted IMAP session SSL/TLS
encrypted. This functionality is not sup- ported by all
servers, and is not used if the session is already encrypted
by the IMAPS method.</p>

<p>imap-use-starttls-user@host Activates imap-use-starttls
for a specific account.</p>

<p>keep This option causes mailx to truncate the user s
system mailbox instead of deleting it when it is empty. This
should always be set, since it prevents malicious users from
creating fake mail folders in a world-writable spool
directory.</p>

<p>keepsave When a message is saved, it is usually
discarded from the origi- nating folder when mailx is quit.
Setting this option causes all saved message to be
retained.</p>

<p>markanswered When a message is replied to and this
variable is set, it is marked as having been answered. This
mark has no technical meaning in the mail system; it just
causes messages to be marked in the header summary, and
makes them specially addressable.</p>

<p>metoo Usually, when a group is expanded that contains
the sender, the sender is removed from the expansion.
Setting this option causes the sender to be included in the
group.</p>

<p>newmail Checks for new mail in the current folder each
time the prompt is printed. For IMAP mailboxes, the server
is then polled for new mail, which may result in delayed
operation if the connec- tion to the server is slow. A
maildir folder must be re-scanned to determine if new mail
has arrived.</p>

<p>If this variable is set to the special value nopoll, an
IMAP server is not actively asked for new mail, but new mail
may still be detected and announced with any other IMAP
command that is sent to the server. A maildir folder is not
scanned then.</p>

<p>In any case, the IMAP server may send notifications
about mes- sages that have been deleted on the server by
another process or client. In this case, Expunged n messages
is printed regard- less of this variable, and message
numbers may have changed.</p>

<p>noheader Setting the option noheader is the same as
giving the -N flag on the command line.</p>

<p>outfolder Causes the filename given in the record
variable and the sender- based filenames for the Copy and
Save commands to be interpreted relative to the directory
given in the folder variable rather than to the current
directory unless it is an absolute pathname.</p>

<p>page If set, each message the pipe command prints out is
followed by a formfeed character.</p>

<p>piperaw Send messages to the pipe command without
performing MIME and character set conversions.</p>

<p>pop3-use-apop If this variable is set, the APOP
authentication method is used when a connection to a POP3
server is initiated. The advantage of this method over the
usual USER/PASS authentication is that the password is not
sent over the network in clear text. The connection fails if
the server does not support the APOP com- mand.</p>

<p>pop3-use-apop-user@host Enables pop3-use-apop for a
specific account.</p>

<p>pop3-use-starttls Causes mailx to issue a STLS command
to make an unencrypted POP3 session SSL/TLS encrypted. This
functionality is not supported by all servers, and is not
used if the session is already encrypted by the POP3S
method.</p>

<p>pop3-use-starttls-user@host Activates pop3-use-starttls
for a specific account.</p>

<p>print-all-chars This option causes all characters to be
considered printable. It is only effective if given in a
startup file. With this option set, some character sequences
in messages may put the users terminal in an undefined state
when printed; it should only be used as a last resort if no
working system locale can be found.</p>

<p>print-alternatives When a MIME message part of type
multipart/alternative is dis- played and it contains a
subpart of type text/plain, other parts are normally
discarded. Setting this variable causes all sub- parts to be
displayed, just as if the surrounding part was of type
multipart/mixed.</p>

<p>quiet Suppresses the printing of the version when first
invoked.</p>

<p>record-resent If both this variable and the record
variable are set, the resend and Resend commands save
messages to the record folder as it is normally only done
for newly composed messages.</p>

<p>reply-in-same-charset If this variable is set, mailx
first tries to use the same char- acter set of the original
message for replies. If this fails, the sendcharsets
variable is evaluated as usual.</p>

<p>Replyall Reverses the sense of reply and Reply
commands.</p>

<p>save When the user aborts a message with two RUBOUT
(interrupt char- acters) mailx copies the partial letter to
the file dead.let- ter in the home directory. This option is
set by default.</p>

<p>searchheaders If this option is set, then a message-list
specifier in the form /x:y will expand to all messages
containing the substring y in the header field x. The string
search is case insensitive.</p>

<p>sendwait When sending a message, wait until the mail
transfer agent exits before accepting further commands. If
the mail transfer agent returns a non-zero exit status, the
exit status of mailx will also be non-zero.</p>

<p>showlast Setting this option causes mailx to start at
the last message instead of the first one when opening a
mail folder.</p>

<p>showname Causes mailx to use the senders real name
instead of the plain address in the header field summary and
in message specifica- tions.</p>

<p>showto Causes the recipient of the message to be shown
in the header summary if the message was sent by the
user.</p>

<p>skipemptybody If an outgoing message does not contain
any text in its first or only message part, do not send it
but discard it silently (see also the -E option).</p>

<p>smime-force-encryption Causes mailx to refuse sending
unencrypted messages.</p>

<p>smime-sign If this variable is set, outgoing messages
are S/MIME signed with the users private key. Signing a
message enables a recip- ient to verify that the sender used
a valid certificate, that the email addresses in the
certificate match those in the mes- sage header, and that
the message content has not been altered. It does not change
the message text, and people will be able to read the
message as usual.</p>

<p>smime-no-default-ca Do not load the default CA locations
when verifying S/MIME signed messages. Only applicable if
S/MIME support is built using OpenSSL.</p>

<p>smtp-use-starttls Causes mailx to issue a STARTTLS
command to make an SMTP session SSL/TLS encrypted. Not all
servers support this command; because of common
implementation defects, it cannot be automati- cally
determined whether a server supports it or not.</p>

<p>ssl-no-default-ca Do not load the default CA locations
to verify SSL/TLS server certificates. Only applicable if
SSL/TLS support is built using OpenSSL.</p>

<p>ssl-v2-allow Accept SSLv2 connections. These are
normally not allowed because this protocol version is
insecure.</p>

<p>stealthmua Inhibits the generation of the Message-Id:_
and _ User-Agent:_ header fields that include obvious
references to mailx. There are two pitfalls associated with
this: First, the message id of outgoing messages is not
known anymore. Second, an expert may still use the remaining
information in the header to track down the originating mail
user agent.</p>

<p>verbose Setting the option verbose is the same as using
the -v flag on the command line. When mailx runs in verbose
mode, details of the actual message delivery and protocol
conversations for IMAP, POP3, and SMTP, as well as of other
internal processes, are dis- played on the user s terminal,
This is sometimes useful to debug problems. Mailx prints all
data that is sent to remote servers in clear texts,
including passwords, so care should be taken that no
unauthorized option can view the screen if this option is
enabled.</p>

<p>writebackedited If this variable is set, messages
modified using the edit or visual commands are written back
to the current folder when it is quit. This is only possible
for writable folders in mbox format. Setting this variable
also disables MIME decoding and decryption for the editing
commands.</p>

<p>String Options The string options include the
following:</p>

<p>attrlist A sequence of characters to print in the
attribute column of a header summary, each for one type of
messages in the following order: new, unread but old, new
but read, read and old, saved, preserved, mboxed, flagged,
answered, draft, killed, start of a collapsed thread,
collapsed, classified as junk. The default is
NUROSPMFATK+-J, or NU *HMFATK+-J if bsdflags or the SYSV3
environment variable are set.</p>

<p>autobcc Specifies a list of recipients to which a blind
carbon copy of each outgoing message will be sent
automatically.</p>

<p>autocc Specifies a list of recipients to which a carbon
copy of each outgoing message will be sent
automatically.</p>

<p>autosort Causes sorted mode (see the sort command) to be
entered automat- ically with the value of this option as
sorting method when a folder is opened.</p>

<p>cmd The default value for the pipe command.</p>

<p>crt The valued option crt is used as a threshold to
determine how long a message must be before PAGER is used to
read it. If crt is set without a value, then the height of
the terminal screen stored in the system is used to compute
the threshold (see stty(1)).</p>

<p>DEAD The name of the file to use for saving aborted
messages. This defaults to dead.letter in the user s home
directory.</p>

<p>EDITOR Pathname of the text editor to use in the edit
command and ~e escape. If not defined, then a default editor
is used.</p>

<p>encoding The default MIME encoding to use in outgoing
text messages and message parts. Valid values are 8bit or
quoted-printable. The default is 8bit. In case the mail
transfer system is not ESMTP compliant, quoted-printable
should be used instead. If there is no need to encode a
message, 7bit transfer mode is used, without regard to the
value of this variable. Binary data is always encoded in
base64 mode.</p>

<p>escape If defined, the first character of this option
gives the charac- ter to use in the place of ~ to denote
escapes.</p>

<p>folder The name of the directory to use for storing
folders of mes- sages. All folder names that begin with +
refer to files below that directory. If the directory name
begins with a /, mailx considers it to be an absolute
pathname; otherwise, the folder directory is found relative
to the user s home directory.</p>

<p>The directory name may also refer to an IMAP account;
any names that begin with + then refer to IMAP mailboxes on
that account. An IMAP folder is normally given in the
form</p>

<p>imaps://mylogin@imap.myisp.example</p>

<p>In this case, the + and @ prefixes for folder names have
the same effect (see the folder command).</p>

<p>Some IMAP servers do not accept the creation of
mailboxes in the hierarchy base; they require that they are
created as subfolders of INBOX. With such servers, a folder
name of the form</p>

<p>imaps://mylogin@imap.myisp.example/INBOX.</p>

<p>should be used (the last character is the server s
hierarchy delimiter). Folder names prefixed by + will then
refer to folders below INBOX, while folder names prefixed by
@ refer to folders below the hierarchy base. See the imap
namespace command for a method to detect the appropriate
prefix and delim- iter.</p>

<p>folder-hook When a folder is opened and this variable is
set, the macro cor- responding to the value of this variable
is executed. The macro is also invoked when new mail
arrives, but message lists for commands executed from the
macro only include newly arrived mes- sages then.</p>

<p>folder-hook-fullname When a folder named fullname is
opened, the macro corresponding to the value of this
variable is executed. Unlike other folder specifications,
the fully expanded name of a folder, without metacharacters,
is used to avoid ambiguities. The macro speci- fied with
folder-hook is not executed if this variable is effec- tive
for a folder (unless it is explicitly invoked within the
called macro).</p>

<p>from The address (or a list of addresses) to put into
the From:_ field of the message header. If replying to a
message, these addresses are handled as if they were in the
alternates list. If the machines hostname is not valid at
the Internet (for example at a dialup machine), either this
variable or hostname have to be set to get correct
Message-ID header fields. If from contains more than one
address, the sender variable must also be set.</p>

<p>fwdheading The string to print before the text of a
message with the for- ward command (unless the
forward-as-attachment variable is set). Defaults to --------
Original Message -------- if unset. If it is set to the
empty string, no heading is printed.</p>

<p>headline A format string to use for the header summary,
similar to printf formats. A % character introduces a format
specifier. It may be followed by a number indicating the
field width. If the field is a number, the width may be
negative, which indicates that it is to be left-aligned.
Valid format specifiers are:</p>

<p>%a Message attributes. %c The score of the message. %d
The date when the message was received. %e The indenting
level in threaded mode. %f The address of the message
sender. %i The message thread structure. %l The number of
lines of the message. %m Message number. %o The number of
octets (bytes) in the message. %s Message subject (if any).
%S Message subject (if any) in double quotes. %t The
position in threaded/sorted order. %&gt; A &gt; for the
current message, otherwise . %&lt; A &lt; for the current
message, otherwise . %% A % character.</p>

<p>The default is %&gt;%a%m %18f %16d %4l/%-5o %i%s, or
%&gt;%a%m %20f %16d %3l/%-5o %i%S if bsdcompat is set.</p>

<p>hostname Use this string as hostname when expanding
local addresses instead of the value obtained from uname(2)
and getaddrinfo(3).</p>

<p>imap-auth Sets the IMAP authentication method. Valid
values are login for the usual password-based authentication
(the default), cram-md5 , which is a password-based
authentication that does not send the password over the
network in clear text, and gss- api for GSSAPI-based
authentication.</p>

<p>imap-auth-user@host Sets the IMAP authentication method
for a specific account.</p>

<p>imap-cache Enables caching of IMAP mailboxes. The value
of this variable must point to a directory that is either
existent or can be cre- ated by mailx. All contents of the
cache can be deleted by mailx at any time; it is not safe to
make assumptions about them.</p>

<p>imap-keepalive IMAP servers may close the connection
after a period of inactiv- ity; the standard requires this
to be at least 30 minutes, but practical experience may
vary. Setting this variable to a numeric value greater than
0 causes a NOOP command to be sent each value seconds if no
other operation is performed.</p>

<p>imap-list-depth When retrieving the list of folders on
an IMAP server, the fold- ers command stops after it has
reached a certain depth to avoid possible infinite loops.
The value of this variable sets the maximum depth allowed.
The default is 2. If the folder separa- tor on the current
IMAP server is a slash /, this variable has no effect, and
the folders command does not descend to subfold- ers.</p>

<p>indentprefix String used by the ~m and ~M tilde escapes
and by the quote option for indenting messages, in place of
the normal tab char- acter (^I). Be sure to quote the value
if it contains spaces or tabs.</p>

<p>junkdb The location of the junk mail database. The
string is treated like a folder name, as described for the
folder command.</p>

<p>The files in the junk mail database are normally stored
in com- press(1) format for saving space. If processing time
is consid- ered more important, uncompress(1) can be used to
store them in plain form. Mailx will then work using the
uncompressed files.</p>

<p>LISTER Pathname of the directory lister to use in the
folders command when operating on local mailboxes. Default
is /bin/ls.</p>

<p>MAIL Is used as the user s mailbox, if set. Otherwise, a
system- dependent default is used. Can be a protocol://
string (see the folder command for more information).</p>

<p>MAILX_HEAD A string to put at the beginning of each new
message. The escape sequences t (tabulator) andn (newline)
are under- stood.</p>

<p>MAILX_TAIL A string to put at the end of each new
message. The escape sequences t (tabulator) and n (newline)
are understood.</p>

<p>maximum-unencoded-line-length Messages that contain
lines longer than the value of this vari- able are encoded
in quoted-printable even if they contain only ASCII
characters. The maximum effective value is 950. If set to 0,
all ASCII text messages are encoded in quoted-printable.
S/MIME signed messages are always encoded in
quoted-printable regardless of the value of this
variable.</p>

<p>MBOX The name of the mbox file. It can be the name of a
folder. The default is mbox in the users home directory.</p>

<p>NAIL_EXTRA_RC The name of an optional startup file to be
read after ~/.mailrc. This variable is ignored if it is
imported from the environment; it has an effect only if it
is set in /etc/mail.rc or ~/.mailrc to allow bypassing the
configuration with e. g. MAILRC=/dev/null. Use this file for
commands that are not understood by other mailx
implementations.</p>

<p>newfolders If this variable has the value maildir, newly
created local folders will be in maildir format.</p>

<p>nss-config-dir A directory that contains the files
certN.db to retrieve cer- tificates, keyN.db to retrieve
private keys, and secmod.db, where N is a digit. These are
usually taken from Mozilla installations, so an appropriate
value might be ~/.mozilla/firefox/default.clm. Mailx opens
these files read- only and does not modify them. However, if
the files are modi- fied by Mozilla while mailx is running,
it will print a Bad database message. It may be necessary to
create copies of these files that are exclusively used by
mailx then. Only applicable if S/MIME and SSL/TLS support is
built using Network Security Services (NSS).</p>

<p>ORGANIZATION The value to put into the _Organization:_
field of the message header.</p>

<p>PAGER Pathname of the program to use in the more command
or when crt variable is set. The default paginator pg(1) or,
in BSD compat- ibility mode, more(1) is used if this option
is not defined.</p>

<p>password-user@host Set the password for user when
connecting to host. If no such variable is defined for a
host, the user will be asked for a password on standard
input. Specifying passwords in a startup file is generally a
security risk, the file should be readable by the invoking
user only.</p>

<p>pipe-content/subcontent When a MIME message part of
content/subcontent type is displayed or it is replied to,
its text is filtered through the value of this variable
interpreted as a shell command. Special care must be taken
when using such commands as mail viruses may be dis-
tributed by this method; if messages of type
application/x-sh were filtered through the shell, for
example, a message sender could easily execute arbitrary
code on the system mailx is run- ning on.</p>

<p>pop3-keepalive POP3 servers may close the connection
after a period of inactiv- ity; the standard requires this
to be at least 10 minutes, but practical experience may
vary. Setting this variable to a numeric value greater than
0 causes a NOOP command to be sent each value seconds if no
other operation is performed.</p>

<p>prompt The string printed when a command is accepted.
Defaults to ? , or to &amp; if the bsdcompat variable is
set.</p>

<p>quote If set, mailx starts a replying message with the
original mes- sage prefixed by the value of the variable
indentprefix. Nor- mally, a heading consisting of
Fromheaderfield wrote: is printed before the quotation. If
the string noheading is assigned to the quote variable, this
heading is omitted. If the string headers is assigned, the
headers selected by the ignore/retain commands are printed
above the message body, thus quote acts like an automatic ~m
command then. If the string allheaders is assigned, all
headers are printed above the mes- sage body, and all MIME
parts are included, thus quote acts like an automatic ~M
command then.</p>

<p>record If defined, gives the pathname of the folder used
to record all outgoing mail. If not defined, then outgoing
mail is not so saved. When saving to this folder fails, the
message is not sent but saved to the dead.letter file
instead.</p>

<p>replyto A list of addresses to put into the _Reply-To:_
field of the message header. If replying to a message, such
addresses are handled as if they were in the alternates
list.</p>

<p>screen When mailx initially prints the message headers,
it determines the number to print by looking at the speed of
the terminal. The faster the terminal, the more it prints.
This option over- rides this calculation and specifies how
many message headers are printed. This number is also used
for scrolling with the z command.</p>

<p>sendcharsets A comma-separated list of character set
names that can be used in Internet mail. When a message that
contains characters not representable in US-ASCII is
prepared for sending, mailx tries to convert its text to
each of the given character sets in order and uses the first
appropriate one. The default is utf-8.</p>

<p>Character sets assigned to this variable should be
ordered in ascending complexity. That is, the list should
start with e.g. iso-8859-1 for compatibility with older mail
clients, might contain some other language-specific
character sets, and should end with utf-8 to handle messages
that combine texts in multi- ple languages.</p>

<p>sender An address that is put into the Sender: field of
outgoing mes- sages. This field needs not normally be
present. It is, how- ever, required if the From: field
contains more than one address. It can also be used to
indicate that a message was sent on behalf of somebody
other; in this case, From: should contain the address of the
person that took responsibility for the message, and Sender:
should contain the address of the person that actually sent
the message. The sender address is handled as if it were in
the alternates list.</p>

<p>sendmail To use an alternate mail delivery system, set
this option to the full pathname of the program to use. This
should be used with care.</p>

<p>SHELL Pathname of the shell to use in the ! command and
the ~! escape. A default shell is used if this option is not
defined.</p>

<p>Sign A string for use with the ~A command.</p>

<p>sign A string for use with the ~a command.</p>

<p>signature Must correspond to the name of a readable file
if set. The file s content is then appended to each
singlepart message and to the first part of each multipart
message. Be warned that there is no possibility to edit the
signa- ture for an individual message.</p>

<p>smime-ca-dir Specifies a directory with CA certificates
for verifica- tion of S/MIME signed messages. The format is
the same as described in SSL_CTX_load_verify_locations(3).
Only applicable if S/MIME support is built using
OpenSSL.</p>

<p>smime-ca-file Specifies a file with CA certificates for
verification of S/MIME signed messages. The format is the
same as described in SSL_CTX_load_verify_locations(3). Only
applicable if S/MIME support is built using OpenSSL.</p>

<p>smime-cipher-user@host Specifies a cipher to use when
generating S/MIME encrypted messages for user@host. Valid
ciphers are rc2-40 (RC2 with 40 bits), rc2-64 (RC2 with 64
bits), des (DES, 56 bits) and des-ede3 (3DES, 112/168 bits).
The default is 3DES. It is not recommended to use the other
ciphers unless a recipient s client is actually unable to
handle 3DES since they are comparatively weak; but even so,
the recipient should upgrade his software in prefer-
ence.</p>

<p>smime-crl-file Specifies a file that contains a CRL in
PEM format to use when verifying S/MIME messages. Only
applicable if S/MIME support is built using OpenSSL.</p>

<p>smime-crl-dir Specifies a directory that contains files
with CRLs in PEM format to use when verifying S/MIME
messages. Only applicable if S/MIME support is built using
OpenSSL.</p>

<p>smime-encrypt-user@host If this variable is set,
messages to user@host are encrypted before sending. If
S/MIME support is built using OpenSSL, the value of the
variable must be set to the name of a file that contains a
certificate in PEM format. If S/MIME support is built using
NSS, the value of this variable is ignored, but if multiple
certificates for user@host are available, the
smime-nickname-user@host variable should be set. Otherwise a
certificate for the recipient is automatically retrieved
from the certificate database, if possible.</p>

<p>If a message is sent to multiple recipients, each of
them for whom a corresponding variable is set will receive
an individually encrypted message; other recipients will
continue to receive the message in plain text unless the
smime-force-encryption variable is set. It is recom- mended
to sign encrypted messages, i.e. to also set the smime-sign
variable.</p>

<p>smime-nickname-user@host Specifies the nickname of a
certificate to be used when encrypting messages for
user@host . Only applicable if S/MIME support is built using
NSS.</p>

<p>smime-sign-cert Points to a file in PEM format that
contains the users private key as well as his certificate.
Both are used with S/MIME for signing and decrypting
messages. Only applicable if S/MIME support is built using
OpenSSL.</p>

<p>smime-sign-cert-user@host Overrides smime-sign-cert for
the specific addresses. When signing messages and the value
of the from variable is set to user@host, the specific file
is used. When decrypting messages, their recipient fields
(To: and Cc:) are searched for addresses for which such a
variable is set. Mailx always uses the first address that
matches, so if the same message is sent to more than one of
the users addresses using different encryption keys, decryp-
tion might fail. Only applicable if S/MIME support is built
using OpenSSL.</p>

<p>smime-sign-nickname Specifies that the named certificate
be used for signing mail. If this variable is not set, but a
single certifi- cate matching the current from address is
found in the database, that one is used automatically. Only
applica- ble if S/MIME support is built using NSS.</p>

<p>smime-sign-nickname-user@host Overrides
smime-sign-nickname for a specific address. Only applicable
if S/MIME support is built using NSS.</p>

<p>smtp Normally, mailx invokes sendmail(8) directly to
transfer messages. If the smtp variable is set, a SMTP
connection to the server specified by the value of this
variable is used instead. If the SMTP server does not use
the stan- dard port, a value of server:port can be given,
with port as a name or as a number.</p>

<p>There are two possible methods to get SSL/TLS encrypted
SMTP sessions: First, the STARTTLS command can be used to
encrypt a session after it has been initiated, but before
any user-related data has been sent; see smtp-use-starttls
above. Second, some servers accept sessions that are
encrypted from their beginning on. This mode is configured
by assigning smtps://server[:port] to the smtp variable.</p>

<p>The SMTP transfer is executed in a child process; unless
either the sendwait or the verbose variable is set, this
process runs asynchronously. If it receives a TERM sig- nal,
it will abort and save the message to the dead.let- ter
file.</p>

<p>smtp-auth Sets the SMTP authentication method. If set to
login, or if unset and smtp-auth-user is set, AUTH LOGIN is
used. If set to cram-md5 , AUTH CRAM-MD5 is used; if set to
plain, AUTH PLAIN is used. Otherwise, no SMTP authentication
is performed.</p>

<p>smtp-auth-user@host Overrides smtp-auth for specific
values of sender addresses, depending on the from
variable.</p>

<p>smtp-auth-password Sets the global password for SMTP
AUTH. Both user and password have to be given for AUTH LOGIN
and AUTH CRAM- MD5.</p>

<p>smtp-auth-password-user@host Overrides
smtp-auth-password for specific values of sender addresses,
depending on the from variable.</p>

<p>smtp-auth-user Sets the global user name for SMTP AUTH.
Both user and password have to be given for AUTH LOGIN and
AUTH CRAM- MD5.</p>

<p>If this variable is set but neither smtp-auth-password
or a matching smtp-auth-password-user@host can be found,
mailx will as for a password on the users terminal.</p>

<p>smtp-auth-user-user@host Overrides smtp-auth-user for
specific values of sender addresses, depending on the from
variable.</p>

<p>ssl-ca-dir Specifies a directory with CA certificates
for verifica- tion of SSL/TLS server certificates. See
SSL_CTX_load_verify_locations(3) for more information. Only
applicable if SSL/TLS support is built using OpenSSL.</p>

<p>ssl-ca-file Specifies a file with CA certificates for
verification of SSL/TLS server certificates. See
SSL_CTX_load_ver- ify_locations(3) for more information.
Only applicable if SSL/TLS support is built using
OpenSSL.</p>

<p>ssl-cert Sets the file name for a SSL/TLS client
certificate required by some servers. Only applicable if
SSL/TLS support is built using OpenSSL.</p>

<p>ssl-cert-user@host Sets an account-specific file name
for a SSL/TLS client certificate required by some servers.
Overrides ssl-cert for the specified account. Only
applicable if SSL/TLS support is built using OpenSSL.</p>

<p>ssl-cipher-list Specifies a list of ciphers for SSL/TLS
connections. See ciphers(1) for more information. Only
applicable if SSL/TLS support is built using OpenSSL.</p>

<p>ssl-crl-file Specifies a file that contains a CRL in PEM
format to use when verifying SSL/TLS server certificates.
Only appli- cable if SSL/TLS support is built using
OpenSSL.</p>

<p>ssl-crl-dir Specifies a directory that contains files
with CRLs in PEM format to use when verifying SSL/TLS server
certificates. Only applicable if SSL/TLS support is built
using OpenSSL.</p>

<p>ssl-key Sets the file name for the private key of a
SSL/TLS client certificate. If unset, the name of the
certifi- cate file is used. The file is expected to be in
PEM format. Only applicable if SSL/TLS support is built
using OpenSSL.</p>

<p>ssl-key-user@host Sets an account-specific file name for
the private key of a SSL/TLS client certificate. Overrides
ssl-key for the specified account. Only applicable if
SSL/TLS support is built using OpenSSL.</p>

<p>ssl-method Selects a SSL/TLS protocol version; valid
values are ssl2, ssl3, and tls1. If unset, the method is
selected automatically, if possible.</p>

<p>ssl-method-user@host Overrides ssl-method for a specific
account.</p>

<p>ssl-rand-egd Gives the pathname to an entropy daemon
socket, see RAND_egd(3).</p>

<p>ssl-rand-file Gives the pathname to a file with entropy
data, see RAND_load_file(3). If the file is a regular file
writable by the invoking user, new data is written to it
after it has been loaded. Only applicable if SSL/TLS support
is built using OpenSSL.</p>

<p>ssl-verify Sets the action to be performed if an error
occurs during SSL/TLS server certificate validation. Valid
values are strict (fail and close connection immediately),
ask (ask whether to continue on standard input), warn (print
a warning and continue), ignore (do not perform validation).
The default is ask.</p>

<p>ssl-verify-user@host Overrides ssl-verify for a specific
account.</p>

<p>toplines If defined, gives the number of lines of a
message to be printed out with the top command; normally,
the first five lines are printed.</p>

<p>ttycharset The character set of the terminal mailx
operates on. There is normally no need to set this variable
since mailx can determine this automatically by looking at
the LC_CTYPE locale setting; if this succeeds, the value is
assigned at startup and will be displayed by the set com-
mand. Note that this is not necessarily a character set name
that can be used in Internet messages.</p>

<p>VISUAL Pathname of the text editor to use in the visual
command and ~v escape.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES Besides the variables described
above, mailx uses the following environment strings:</p>

<p>HOME The users home directory.</p>

<p>LANG, LC_ALL, LC_COLLATE, LC_CTYPE, LC_MESSAGES See
locale(7).</p>

<p>MAILRC Is used as startup file instead of ~/.mailrc if
set. When mailx scripts are invoked on behalf of other
users, this variable should be set to /dev/null to avoid
side- effects from reading their configuration files.</p>

<p>NAILRC If this variable is set and MAILRC is not set, it
is read as startup file.</p>

<p>SYSV3 Changes the letters printed in the first column of
a header summary.</p>

<p>TMPDIR Used as directory for temporary files instead of
/tmp, if set.</p>

<p>FILES ~/.mailrc File giving initial commands.</p>

<p>/etc/mail.rc System wide initialization file.</p>

<p>~/.mime.types Personal MIME types.</p>

<p>/etc/mime.types System wide MIME types.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Getting started The mailx command has two
distinct usages, according to whether one wants to send or
receive mail. Sending mail is simple: to send a message to a
user whose email address is, say, &lt;bill@host.example&gt;,
use the shell command:</p>

<p>$ mailx bill@host.example</p>

<p>then type your message. Mailx will prompt you for a
message subject first; after that, lines typed by you form
the body of the message. When you reach the end of the
message, type an EOT (control-d) at the beginning of a line,
which will cause mailx to echo EOT and return you to the
shell.</p>

<p>If, while you are composing the message you decide that
you do not wish to send it after all, you can abort the
letter with a RUBOUT. Typing a single RUBOUT causes mailx to
print (Inter- rupt -- one more to kill letter). Typing a
second RUBOUT causes mailx to save your partial letter on
the file dead.let- ter in your home directory and abort the
letter. Once you have sent mail to someone, there is no way
to undo the act, so be careful.</p>

<p>If you want to send the same message to several other
people, you can list their email addresses on the command
line. Thus,</p>

<p>$ mailx sam@workstation.example bob@server.example
Subject: Fees Tuition fees are due next Friday. Dont forget!
&lt;Control-d&gt; EOT $</p>

<p>will send the reminder to
&lt;sam@workstation.example&gt;. and
&lt;bob@server.example&gt;.</p>

<p>To read your mail, simply type</p>

<p>$ mailx</p>

<p>Mailx will respond by typing its version number and date
and then listing the messages you have waiting. Then it will
type a prompt and await your command. The messages are
assigned num- bers starting with 1you refer to the messages
with these num- bers. Mailx keeps track of which messages
are new (have been sent since you last read your mail) and
read (have been read by you). New messages have an N next to
them in the header listing and old, but unread messages have
a U next to them. Mailx keeps track of new/old and
read/unread messages by putting a header field called Status
into your messages.</p>

<p>To look at a specific message, use the type command,
which may be abbreviated to simply t . For example, if you
had the fol- lowing messages:</p>

<p>O 1 drfoo@myhost.example Wed Sep 1 19:52 18/631
&quot;Fees&quot; O 2 sam@friends.example Thu Sep 2 00:08
30/895</p>

<p>you could examine the first message by giving the
command:</p>

<p>type 1</p>

<p>which might cause to respond with, for example:</p>

<p>Message 1: From drfoo@myhost.example Wed Sep 1 19:52:25
2004 Subject: Fees Status: R</p>

<p>Tuition fees are due next Wednesday. Dont forget!</p>

<p>Many mailx commands that operate on messages take a
message num- ber as an argument like the type command. For
these commands, there is a notion of a current message. When
you enter the mailx program, the current message is
initially the first (or the first recent) one. Thus, you can
often omit the message number and use, for example,</p>

<p>t</p>

<p>to type the current message. As a further shorthand, you
can type a message by simply giving its message number.
Hence,</p>

<p>1</p>

<p>would type the first message.</p>

<p>Frequently, it is useful to read the messages in your
mailbox in order, one after another. You can read the next
message in mailx by simply typing a newline. As a special
case, you can type a newline as your first command to mailx
to type the first message.</p>

<p>If, after typing a message, you wish to immediately send
a reply, you can do so with the reply command. This command,
like type, takes a message number as an argument. mailx then
begins a message addressed to the user who sent you the
message. You may then type in your letter in reply, followed
by a &lt;control-d&gt; at the beginning of a line, as
before.</p>

<p>Note that mailx copies the subject header from the
original mes- sage. This is useful in that correspondence
about a particular matter will tend to retain the same
subject heading, making it easy to recognize. If there are
other header fields in the mes- sage, like Cc:, the
information found will also be used.</p>

<p>Sometimes you will receive a message that has been sent
to sev- eral people and wish to reply only to the person who
sent it. Reply with a capital R replies to a message, but
sends a copy to the sender only.</p>

<p>If you wish, while reading your mail, to send a message
to some- one, but not as a reply to one of your messages,
you can send the message directly with the mail command,
which takes as argu- ments the names of the recipients you
wish to send to. For example, to send a message to
&lt;frank@machine.example&gt;, you would do:</p>

<p>mail frank@machine.example</p>

<p>To delete a message from the mail folder, you can use
the delete command. In addition to not saving deleted
messages, mailx will not let you type them, either. The
effect is to make the mes- sage disappear altogether, along
with its number.</p>

<p>Many features of mailx can be tailored to your liking
with the set command. The set command has two forms,
depending on whether you are setting a binary option or a
valued option. Binary options are either on or off. For
example, the askcc option informs mailx that each time you
send a message, you want it to prompt you for a Cc: header,
to be included in the mes- sage. To set the askcc option,
you would type</p>

<p>set askcc</p>

<p>Valued options are values which mailx uses to adapt to
your tastes. For example, the record option tells mailx
where to save messages sent by you, and is specified by</p>

<p>set record=Sent</p>

<p>for example. Note that no spaces are allowed in set
record=Sent .</p>

<p>Mailx includes a simple facility for maintaining groups
of mes- sages together in folders. To use the folder
facility, you must tell mailx where you wish to keep your
folders. Each folder of messages will be a single file. For
convenience, all of your folders are kept in a single
directory of your choosing. To tell mailx where your folder
directory is, put a line of the form</p>

<p>set folder=letters</p>

<p>in your .mailrc file. If, as in the example above, your
folder directory does not begin with a /, mailx will assume
that your folder directory is to be found starting from your
home direc- tory.</p>

<p>Anywhere a file name is expected, you can use a folder
name, preceded with +. For example, to put a message into a
folder with the save command, you can use:</p>

<p>save +classwork</p>

<p>to save the current message in the classwork folder. If
the classwork folder does not yet exist, it will be created.
Note that messages which are saved with the save command are
automat- ically removed from your system mailbox.</p>

<p>In order to make a copy of a message in a folder without
causing that message to be removed from your system mailbox,
use the copy command, which is identical in all other
respects to the save command.</p>

<p>The folder command can be used to direct mailx to the
contents of a different folder. For example,</p>

<p>folder +classwork</p>

<p>directs mailx to read the contents of the classwork
folder. All of the commands that you can use on your system
mailbox are also applicable to folders, including type,
delete, and reply. To inquire which folder you are currently
editing, use simply:</p>

<p>folder</p>

<p>To list your current set of folders, use the folders
command.</p>

<p>Finally, the help command is available to print out a
brief sum- mary of the most important mailx commands.</p>

<p>While typing in a message to be sent to others, it is
often use- ful to be able to invoke the text editor on the
partial message, print the message, execute a shell command,
or do some other auxiliary function. Mailx provides these
capabilities through tilde escapes , which consist of a
tilde (~) at the beginning of a line, followed by a single
character which indicates the func- tion to be performed.
For example, to print the text of the message so far,
use:</p>

<p>~p</p>

<p>which will print a line of dashes, the recipients of
your mes- sage, and the text of the message so far. A list
of the most important tilde escapes is available with
~?.</p>

<p>IMAP or POP3 client setup First you need the following
data from your ISP: the host name of the IMAP or POP3
server, user name and password for this server, and a notice
whether the server uses SSL/TLS encryption. Assuming the
host name is server.myisp.example and your user name for
that server is mylogin, you can refer to this account using
the folder command or -f command line option with</p>

<p>imaps://mylogin@server.myisp.example</p>

<p>(This string is not necessarily the same as your
Internet mail address.) You can replace imaps:// with
imap:// if the server does not support SSL/TLS. (If SSL/TLS
support is built using NSS, the nss-config-dir variable must
be set before a con- nection can be initiated, see above).
Use pop3s:// or pop3:// if the server does not offer IMAP.
You should use IMAP if you can, though; first because it
requires fewer network operations than POP3 to get the
contents of the mailbox and is thus faster; and second
because message attributes are main- tained by the IMAP
server, so you can easily distinguish new and old messages
each time you connect. Even if the server does not accept
IMAPS or POP3S connections, it is possible that it sup-
ports the STARTTLS method to make a session SSL/TLS
encrypted after the initial connection has been performed,
but before authentication begins. The only reliable method
to see if this works is to try it; enter one of</p>

<p>set imap-use-starttls set pop3-use-starttls</p>

<p>before you initiate the connection.</p>

<p>As you probably want messages to be deleted from this
account after saving them, prefix it with %: . The shortcut
command can be used to avoid typing that many characters
every time you want to connect:</p>

<p>shortcut myisp
%:imaps://mylogin@server.myisp.example</p>

<p>You might want to put this string into a startup file.
As the shortcut command is specific to this implementation
of mailx and will confuse other implementations, it should
not be used in ~/.mailrc, instead, put</p>

<p>set NAIL_EXTRA_RC=~/.nailrc</p>

<p>in ~/.mailrc and create a file ~/.nailrc containing the
shortcut command above. You can then access your remote
mailbox by invoking mailx -f myisp on the command line, or
by executing fi myisp within mailx.</p>

<p>If you want to use more than one IMAP mailbox on a
server, or if you want to use the IMAP server for mail
storage too, the account command (which is also
mailx-specific) is more appropri- ate than the shortcut
command. You can put the following in ~/.nailrc:</p>

<p>account myisp { set
folder=imaps://mylogin@server.myisp.example set record=+Sent
MBOX=+mbox outfolder }</p>

<p>and can then access incoming mail for this account by
invoking mailx -A myisp on the command line, or by executing
ac myisp within mailx. After that, a command like copy 1
+otherfolder will refer to otherfolder on the IMAP server.
In particular, fi &amp; will change to the mbox folder, and
fi +Sent will show your recorded sent mail, with both
folders located on the IMAP server.</p>

<p>Mailx will ask you for a password string each time you
connect to a remote account. If you can reasonably trust the
security of your workstation, you can give this password in
the startup file as</p>

<p>set
password-mylogin@server.myisp.example=&quot;SECRET&quot;</p>

<p>You should change the permissions of this file to 0600,
see chmod(1).</p>

<p>Mailx supports different authentication methods for both
IMAP and POP3. If Kerberos is used at your location, you can
try to activate GSSAPI-based authentication by</p>

<p>set imap-auth=gssapi</p>

<p>The advantage of this method is that mailx does not need
to know your password at all, nor needs to send sensitive
data over the network. Otherwise, the options</p>

<p>set imap-auth=cram-md5 set pop3-use-apop</p>

<p>for IMAP and POP3, respectively, offer authentication
methods that avoid to send the password in clear text over
the network, which is especially important if SSL/TLS cannot
be used. If the server does not offer any of these
authentication methods, con- ventional user/password based
authentication must be used. It is sometimes helpful to set
the verbose option when authentica- tion problems occur.
Mailx will display all data sent to the server in clear text
on the screen with this option, including passwords. You
should thus take care that no unauthorized per- son can look
at your terminal when this option is set.</p>

<p>If you regularly use the same workstation to access IMAP
accounts, you can greatly enhance performance by enabling
local caching of IMAP messages. For any message that has
been fully or partially fetched from the server, a local
copy is made and is used when the message is accessed again,
so most data is transferred over the network once only. To
enable the IMAP cache, select a local directory name and
put</p>

<p>set imap-cache=~/localdirectory</p>

<p>in the startup file. All files within that directory can
be overwritten or deleted by mailx at any time, so you
should not use the directory to store other information.</p>

<p>Once the cache contains some messages, it is not
strictly neces- sary anymore to open a connection to the
IMAP server to access them. When mailx is invoked with the
-D option, or when the disconnected variable is set, only
cached data is used for any folder you open. Messages that
have not yet been completely cached are not available then,
but all other messages can be handled as usual. Changes made
to IMAP mailboxes in discon- nected mode are committed to
the IMAP server next time it is used in online mode.
Synchronizing the local status with the status on the server
is thus partially within your responsibil- ity; if you
forget to initiate a connection to the server again before
you leave your location, changes made on one workstation are
not available on others. Also if you alter IMAP mailboxes
from a workstation while uncommitted changes are still
pending on another, the latter data may become invalid. The
same might also happen because of internal server status
changes. You should thus carefully evaluate this feature in
your environment before you rely on it.</p>

<p>Many servers will close the connection after a short
period of inactivity. Use one of</p>

<p>set pop3-keepalive=30 set imap-keepalive=240</p>

<p>to send a keepalive message each 30 seconds for POP3, or
each 4 minutes for IMAP.</p>

<p>If you encounter problems connecting to a SSL/TLS
server, try the ssl-rand-egd and ssl-rand-file variables
(see the OpenSSL FAQ for more information) or specify the
protocol version with ssl-method. Contact your ISP if you
need a client certificate or if verification of the server
certificate fails. If the failed certificate is indeed
valid, fetch its CA certificate by executing the shell
command</p>

<p>$ openssl s_client &lt;/dev/null -showcerts -connect
server.myisp.example:imaps 2&gt;&amp;1 | tee log</p>

<p>(see s_client(1)) and put it into the file specified
with ssl- ca-file. The data you need is located at the end
of the cer- tificate chain within (and including) the BEGIN
CERTIFICATE and END CERTIFICATE lines. (Note that it is
possible to fetch a forged certificate by this method. You
can only completely rely on the authenticity of the CA
certificate if you fetch it in a way that is trusted by
other means, such as by personally receiving the certificate
on storage media.)</p>

<p>Creating a score file or message filter The scoring
commands are best separated from other configuration for
clarity, and are mostly mailx specific. It is thus recom-
mended to put them in a separate file that is sourced from
your NAIL_EXTRA_RC as follows:</p>

<p>source ~/.scores</p>

<p>The .scores file could then look as follows:</p>

<p>define list { score (subject &quot;important
discussion&quot;) +10 score (subject &quot;annoying
discussion&quot;) -10 score (from
&quot;nicefellow@goodnet&quot;) +15 score (from
&quot;badguy@poornet&quot;) -5 move (header x-spam-flag
&quot;+++++&quot;) +junk } set
folder-hook-imap://user@host/public.list=list</p>

<p>In this scheme, you would see any mail from
nicefellow@good- net, even if the surrounding discussion is
annoying; but you normally would not see mail from
badguy@poornet, unless he participates in the important
discussion. Messages that are marked with five or more plus
characters in their X-Spam-Flag field (inserted by some
server-side filtering software) are moved to the folder junk
in the folder directory.</p>

<p>Be aware that all criteria in () lead to substring
matches, so you would also score messages from e.g.
notsobadguy@poornetmak- ers negative here. It is possible to
select addresses exactly using &quot;address&quot; message
specifications, but these cannot be exe- cuted remotely and
will thus cause all headers to be downloaded from IMAP
servers while looking for matches.</p>

<p>When searching messages on an IMAP server, best
performance is usually achieved by sending as many criteria
as possible in one large () specification, because each
single such specification will result in a separate network
operation.</p>

<p>Activating the Bayesian filter The Bayesian junk mail
filter works by examining the words con- tained in messages.
You decide yourself what a good and what a bad message is.
Thus the resulting filter is your very personal one; once it
is correctly set up, it will filter only messages similar to
those previously specified by you.</p>

<p>To use the Bayesian filter, a location for the junk mail
database must be defined first:</p>

<p>set junkdb=~/.junkdb</p>

<p>The junk mail database does not contain actual words
extracted from messages, but hashed representations of them.
A foreign person who can read the database could only
examine the fre- quency of previously known words in your
mail.</p>

<p>If you have sufficient disk space (several 10 MB)
available, it is recommended that you set the
chained-junk-tokens option. The filter will then also
consider two-word tokens, improving its accuracy.</p>

<p>A set of good messages and junk messages must now be
available; it is also possible to use the incoming new
messages for this purpose, although it will of course take
some time until the filter becomes useful then. Do not
underestimate the amount of statistical data needed; some
hundred messages are typically necessary to get satisfactory
results, and many thousand mes- sages for best operation.
You have to pass the good messages to the good command, and
the junk messages to the junk command. If you ever
accidentally mark a good message as junk or vice-versa, call
the ungood or unjunk command to correct this.</p>

<p>Once a reasonable amount of statistics has been
collected, new messages can be classified automatically. The
classify command marks all messages that the filter
considers to be junk, but it does not perform any action on
them by default. It is recom- mended that you move these
messages into a separate folder just for the case that false
positives occur, or to pass them to the junk command later
again to further improve the junk mail database. To
automatically move incoming junk messages every time the
inbox is opened, put lines like the following into your
.scores file (or whatever name you gave to the file in the
last example):</p>

<p>define junkfilter { classify (smaller 20000) :n move :j
+junk } set
folder-hook-imap://user@host/INBOX=junkfilter</p>

<p>If you set the verbose option before running the
classify com- mand, mailx prints the words it uses for
calculating the junk status along with their statistical
probabilities. This can help you to find out why some
messages are not classified as you would like them to be. To
see the statistical probability of a given word, use the
probability command.</p>

<p>If a junk message was not recognized as such, use the
junk com- mand to correct this. Also if you encounter a
false positive (a good message that was wrongly classified
as junk), pass it to the good command.</p>

<p>Since the classify command must examine the entire text
of all new messages in the respective folder, this will also
cause all of them to be downloaded from the IMAP server. You
should thus restrict the size of messages for automatic
filtering. If server-based filtering is also available, you
might try if that works for you first.</p>

<p>Reading HTML mail You need either the w3m or lynx
utility or another command-line web browser that can write
plain text to standard output.</p>

<p>set pipe-text/html=&quot;w3m -dump -T
text/html&quot;</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>set pipe-text/html=&quot;lynx -dump -force_html
/dev/stdin&quot;</p>

<p>will then cause HTML message parts to be converted into
a more friendly form.</p>

<p>Viewing PDF attachments Most PDF viewers do not accept
input directly from a pipe. It is thus necessary to store
the attachment in a temporary file, as with</p>

<p>set pipe-application/pdf=&quot;cat &gt;/tmp/mailx$$.pdf;
acroread /tmp/mailx$$.pdf; rm /tmp/mailx$$.pdf&quot;</p>

<p>Note that security defects are discovered in PDF viewers
from time to time. Automatical command execution like this
can com- promise your system security, in particular if you
stay not always informed about such issues.</p>

<p>Signed and encrypted messages with S/MIME S/MIME
provides two central mechanisms: message signing and mes-
sage encryption. A signed message contains some data in
addi- tion to the regular text. The data can be used to
verify that the message was sent using a valid certificate,
that the senders address in the message header matches that
in the cer- tificate, and that the message text has not been
altered. Sign- ing a message does not change its regular
text; it can be read regardless of whether the recipients
software is able to handle S/MIME. It is thus usually
possible to sign all outgoing mes- sages if so
desired.Encryption, in contrast, makes the message text
invisible for all people except those who have access to the
secret decryption key. To encrypt a message, the specific
recipients public encryption key must be known. It is thus
not possible to send encrypted mail to people unless their
key has been retrieved from either previous communication or
public key directories. A message should always be signed
before it is encrypted. Otherwise, it is still possible that
the encrypted message text is altered.</p>

<p>A central concept to S/MIME is that of the certification
author- ity (CA). A CA is a trusted institution that issues
certifi- cates. For each of these certificates, it can be
verified that it really originates from the CA, provided
that the CAs own certificate is previously known. A set of
CA certificates is usually delivered with OpenSSL and
installed on your system. If you trust the source of your
OpenSSL software installation, this offers reasonable
security for S/MIME on the Internet. In gen- eral, a
certificate cannot be more secure than the method its CA
certificate has been retrieved with, though. Thus if you
down- load a CA certificate from the Internet, you can only
trust the messages you verify using that certificate as much
as you trust the download process.</p>

<p>The first thing you need for participating in S/MIME
message exchange is your personal certificate, including a
private key. The certificate contains public information, in
particular your name and your email address, and the public
key that is used by others to encrypt messages for you, and
to verify signed mes- sages they supposedly received from
you. The certificate is included in each signed message you
send. The private key must be kept secret. It is used to
decrypt messages that were previ- ously encrypted with your
public key, and to sign messages.</p>

<p>For personal use, it is recommended that you get a
S/MIME cer- tificate from one of the major CAs on the
Internet using your WWW browser. (Many CAs offer such
certificates for free.) You will usually receive a combined
certificate and private key in PKCS#12 format which mailx
does not directly accept if S/MIME support is built using
OpenSSL. To convert it to PEM format, use the following
shell command:</p>

<p>$ openssl pkcs12 -in cert.p12 -out cert.pem -clcerts
-nodes</p>

<p>If you omit the -nodes parameter, you can specifiy an
additional PEM pass phrase for protecting the private key.
Mailx will then ask you for that pass phrase each time it
signs or decrypts a message. You can then use</p>

<p>set smime-sign-cert-myname@myisp.example=cert.pem</p>

<p>to make this private key and certificate known to
mailx.</p>

<p>If S/MIME support is built using NSS, the PKCS#12 file
must be installed using Mozilla (provided that
nss-config-dir is set appropriately, see above), and no
further action is necessary unless multiple user
certificates for the same email address are installed. In
this case, the smime-sign-nickname variable has to be set
appropriately.</p>

<p>You can now sign outgoing messages. Just use</p>

<p>set smime-sign</p>

<p>to do so.</p>

<p>From each signed message you send, the recipient can
fetch your certificate and use it to send encrypted mail
back to you. Accordingly if somebody sends you a signed
message, you can do the same. First use the verify command
to check the validity of the certificate. After that,
retrieve the certificate and tell mailx that it should use
it for encryption:</p>

<p>certsave filename set
smime-encrypt-user@host=filename</p>

<p>If S/MIME support is built using NSS, the saved
certificate must be installed using Mozilla. The value of
the smime-encrypt- user@host is ignored then, but if
multiple certificates for the recipient are available, the
smime-nickname-user@host variable must be set.</p>

<p>You should carefully consider if you prefer to store
encrypted messages in decrypted form. If you do, anybody who
has access to your mail folders can read them, but if you do
not, you might be unable to read them yourself later if you
happen to lose your private key. The decrypt command saves
messages in decrypted form, while the save, copy, and move
commands leave them encrypted.</p>

<p>Note that neither S/MIME signing nor encryption applies
to message subjects or other header fields. Thus they may
not con- tain sensitive information for encrypted messages,
and cannot be trusted even if the message content has been
verified. When sending signed messages, it is recommended to
repeat any impor- tant header information in the message

<p>Using CRLs with S/MIME or SSL/TLS Certification
authorities (CAs) issue certificate revocation lists (CRLs)
on a regular basis. These lists contain the serial numbers
of certificates that have been declared invalid after they
have been issued. Such usually happens because the private
key for the certificate has been compromised, because the
owner of the certificate has left the organization that is
mentioned in the certificate, etc. To seriously use S/MIME
or SSL/TLS verification, an up-to-date CRL is required for
each trusted CA. There is otherwise no method to distinguish
between valid and invalidated certificates. Mailx currently
offers no mechanism to fetch CRLs, or to access them on the
Internet, so you have to retrieve them by some external
mechanism.</p>

<p>If S/MIME and SSL/TLS support are built using OpenSSL,
mailx accepts CRLs in PEM format only; CRLs in DER format
must be con- verted, e.g. with the shell command</p>

<p>$ openssl crl -inform DER -in crl.der -out crl.pem</p>

<p>To tell mailx about the CRLs, a directory that contains
all CRL files (and no other files) must be created. The
smime-crl-dir or ssl-crl-dir variables, respectively, must
then be set to point to that directory. After that, mailx
requires a CRL to be present for each CA that is used to
verify a certificate.</p>

<p>If S/MIME and SSL/TLS support are built using NSS, CRLs
can be imported in Mozilla applications (provided that
nss-config-dir is set appropriately).</p>

<p>Sending mail from scripts If you want to send mail from
scripts, you must be aware that mailx reads the user s
configuration files by default. So unless your script is
only intended for your own personal use (as e.g. a cron
job), you need to circumvent this by invoking mailx like</p>

<p>MAILRC=/dev/null mailx -n</p>

<p>You then need to create a configuration for mailx for
your script. This can be done by either pointing the MAILRC
variable to a custom configuration file, or by passing the
configuration in environment variables. Since many of the
configuration options are not valid shell variables, the env
command is useful in this situation. An invocation could
thus look like</p>

<p>env MAILRC=/dev/null from=scriptreply@domain smtp=host
smtp-auth-user=login smtp-auth-password=secret
smtp-auth=login mailx -n -s &quot;subject&quot; -a
attachment_file recipient@domain &lt;content_file</p>

<p>NOTES Variables in the environment passed to mailx
cannot be unset.</p>

<p>The character set conversion relies on the iconv(3)
function. Its functionality differs widely between the
various system environments mailx runs on. If the message
Cannot convert from a to b appears, either some characters
within the message header or text are not appropriate for
the currently selected terminal character set, or the needed
conversion is not sup- ported by the system. In the first
case, it is necessary to set an appropriate LC_CTYPE locale
(e.g. en_US) or the ttycharset variable. In the second case,
the sendcharsets and ttycharset variables must be set to the
same value to inhibit character set conversion. If iconv()
is not available at all, the value assigned to sendcharsets
must match the character set that is used on the
terminal.</p>

<p>Mailx expects input text to be in Unix format, with
lines separated by newline (^J, 0 characters only. Non-Unix
text ) characters in files that use carriage return (^M,
addition will be treated as binary data; to send such files
as text, strip these characters e. g. by</p>

<p>tr -d 15 &lt;input | mailx . . .</p>

<p>or fix the tools that generate them.</p>

<p>Limitations with IMAP mailboxes are: It is not possible
to edit messages, but it is possible to append them. Thus to
edit a message, create a local copy of it, edit it, append
it, and delete the original. The line count for the header
display is only appropriate if the entire message has been
downloaded from the server. The marking of messages as new
is performed by the IMAP server; use of the exit command
instead of quit will not cause it to be reset, and if the
autoinc/newmail variables are unset, messages that arrived
during a session will not be in state new anymore when the
folder is opened again. Also if commands queued in
disconnected mode are committed, the IMAP server will delete
the new flag for all messages in the changed folder, and new
messages will appear as unread when it is selected for
viewing later. The flagged, answered , and draft attributes
are usually permanent, but some IMAP servers are known to
drop them without notification. Message numbers may change
with IMAP every time before the prompt is printed if mailx
is notified by the server that messages have been deleted by
some other client or process. In this case, Expunged n mes-
sages is printed, and message numbers may have changed.</p>

<p>Limitations with POP3 mailboxes are: It is not possible
to edit messages, they can only be copied and deleted. The
line count for the header display is only appropriate if the
entire message has been downloaded from the server. The
status field of a mes- sage is maintained by the server
between connections; some servers do not update it at all,
and with a server that does, the exit command will not cause
the message status to be reset. The newmail command and the
newmail variable have no effect. It is not possible to
rename or to remove POP3 mail- boxes.</p>

<p>If a RUBOUT (interrupt) is typed while an IMAP or POP3
operation is in progress, mailx will wait until the
operation can be safely aborted, and will then return to the
command loop and print the prompt again. When a second
RUBOUT is typed while mailx is waiting for the operation to
complete, the operation itself will be canceled. In this
case, data that has not been fetched yet will have to be
fetched before the next command can be performed. If the
canceled operation was using an SSL/TLS encrypted channel,
an error in the SSL transport will very likely result, and
the connection is no longer usable.</p>

<p>As mailx is a mail user agent, it provides only basic
SMTP ser- vices. If it fails to contact its upstream SMTP
server, it will not make further attempts to transfer the
message at a later time, and it does not leave other
information about this condi- tion than an error message on
the terminal and a dead.letter file. This is usually not a
problem if the SMTP server is located in the same local
network as the computer on which mailx is run. However, care
should be taken when using a remote server of an ISP; it
might be better to set up a local SMTP server then which
just acts as a proxy.</p>

<p>Mailx immediately contacts the SMTP server (or
/usr/lib/sendmail) even when operating in disconnected mode.
It would not make much sense for mailx to defer outgoing
mail since SMTP servers usually provide much more elaborated
delay handling than mailx could perform as a client. Thus
the recommended setup for sending mail in disconnected mode
is to configure a local SMTP server such that it sends
outgoing mail as soon as an external network connection is
available again, i.e. to advise it to do that from a network
startup script.</p>
