<p>NAME aliases - aliases file for sendmail</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS aliases</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This file describes user ID aliases used by
sendmail. The file resides in /etc and is formatted as a
series of lines of the form</p>

<p>name: addr_1, addr_2, addr_3, . . .</p>

<p>The name is the name to alias, and the addr_n are the
aliases for that name. addr_n can be another alias, a local
username, a local filename, a command, an include file, or
an external address.</p>

<p>Local Username username</p>

<p>The username must be available via getpwnam(3).</p>

<p>Local Filename /path/name</p>

<p>Messages are appended to the file specified by the full
pathname (starting with a slash (/))</p>

<p>Command |command</p>

<p>A command starts with a pipe symbol (|), it receives
messages via standard input.</p>

<p>Include File :include: /path/name</p>

<p>The aliases in pathname are added to the aliases for
name.</p>

<p>E-Mail Address user@domain</p>

<p>An e-mail address in RFC 822 format.</p>

<p>Lines beginning with white space are continuation lines.
Another way to continue lines is by placing a backslash
directly before a newline. Lines beginning with # are
comments.</p>

<p>Aliasing occurs only on local names. Loops can not
occur, since no message will be sent to any person more than
once.</p>

<p>If an alias is found for name, sendmail then checks for
an alias for owner-name. If it is found and the result of
the lookup expands to a single address, the envelope sender
address of the message is rewritten to that address. If it
is found and the result expands to more than one address,
the envelope sender address is changed to owner-name.</p>

<p>After aliasing has been done, local and valid recipients
who have a .forward file in their home directory have
messages forwarded to the list of users defined in that
file.</p>

<p>This is only the raw data file; the actual aliasing
information is placed into a binary format in the file
/etc/aliases.db using the program newaliases(1). A
newaliases command should be executed each time the aliases
file is changed for the change to take effect.</p>

<p>SENDMAIL Installation and Operation Guide.</p>

<p>SENDMAIL An Internetwork Mail Router.</p>

<p>BUGS If you have compiled sendmail with DBM support
instead of NEWDB, you may have encountered problems in
dbm(3) restricting a single alias to about 1000 bytes of
information. You can get longer aliases by chaining ; that
is, make the last name in the alias be a dummy name which is
a continuation alias.</p>

<p>HISTORY The aliases file format appeared in 4.0BSD.</p>
