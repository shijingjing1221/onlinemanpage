<p>PIPE(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual PIPE(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME pipe - create an interprocess channel</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>int pipe(int fildes[2]);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pipe() function shall create a pipe and
place two file descriptors, one each into the arguments
fildes[0] and fildes[1], that refer to the open file
descriptions for the read and write ends of the pipe. Their
integer values shall be the two lowest available at the time
of the pipe() call. The O_NONBLOCK and FD_CLOEXEC flags
shall be clear on both file descriptors. (The fcntl()
function can be used to set both these flags.)</p>

<p>Data can be written to the file descriptor fildes[1] and
read from the file descriptor fildes[0]. A read on the file
descriptor fildes[0] shall access data written to the file
descriptor fildes[1] on a first- in-first-out basis. It is
unspecified whether fildes[0] is also open for writing and
whether fildes[1] is also open for reading.</p>

<p>A process has the pipe open for reading (correspondingly
writing) if it has a file descriptor open that refers to the
read end, fildes[0] (write end, fildes[1]).</p>

<p>Upon successful completion, pipe() shall mark for update
the st_atime, st_ctime, and st_mtime fields of the pipe.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, 0 shall be
returned; otherwise, -1 shall be returned and errno set to
indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The pipe() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EMFILE More than {OPEN_MAX} minus two file descriptors
are already in use by this process.</p>

<p>ENFILE The number of simultaneously open files in the
system would exceed a system-imposed limit.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The wording carefully avoids using the verb
&quot;to open&quot; in order to avoid any implication of use
of open(); see also write() .</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>

volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, &lt;fcntl.h&gt;,
