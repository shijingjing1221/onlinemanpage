<p>NAME pammixinterlace - mix adjacent lines to merge
interlaced images</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pammixinterlace</p>

<p>[-filter={linear, fir, ffmpeg}]</p>

<p>[-adaptive]</p>

<p>[infile]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pammixinterlace is meant to operate on an image which is
the interlac- ing of two images, where raster rows 0, 2, 4,
etc. are from one image and rows 1, 3, 5, etc. are from
another. (See below for why you might expect to encounter
such an image).</p>

<p>pammixinterlace makes each row of the output a mixture
of the corre- sponding row of the input and its two
neighbors. It uses half of the main row and a quarter each
of the two neighbor rows.</p>

<p>This can be useful if the image is a video capture from
an interlaced video source. In that case, each row shows the
subject 1/60 second before or after the two rows that
surround it. If the subject is mov- ing, this can detract
from the quality of the image.</p>

<p>In video data streams, you often find each frame
contains only half the rows of the image -- the odd half or
the even half. The displayer of the stream displays the rows
in their proper positions on a CRT as they come in. When you
display the rows in this order, the CRT has less flicker
because a particular area of the screen gets refreshed twice
as often. In the process of capturing such a stream,
computers often gen- erate the interlaced image of the type
that pammixinterlace works with. But this interlaced image,
when displayed on a CRT, does not look the same as if a
displayer were rendering the stream directly on a CRT as it
arrived, because of the timing of when the various pixels
get drawn and subsequently fade. Thats why you need
something like pammixinter- lace.</p>

<p>You may prefer the effect of simply extracting one of
two images. You can do that with pamdeinterlace.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -filter={linear,fir,ffmpeg} This option chooses
between one of the three filtering mecha- nisms. linear is a
linear-blend formula. fir is a size-5 FIR low-pass filter,
and ffmpeg is a formula pulled from the docu- mentation of
the program ffmpeg .</p>

<p>The default is fir.</p>

<p>-adaptive This option turns on &quot;adaptive&quot;
filtering mode. In this mode pammixinterlace modifies only
pixels that are obviously part of a &quot;comb&quot;
pattern.</p>
