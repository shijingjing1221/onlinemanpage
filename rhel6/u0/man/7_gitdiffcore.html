<p>NAME gitdiffcore - Tweaking diff output</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS git diff *</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The diff commands git diff-index, git
diff-files, and git diff-tree can be told to manipulate
differences they find in unconventional ways before showing
diff output. The manipulation is collectively called
&quot;diffcore transformation&quot;. This short note
describes what they are and how to use them to produce diff
output that is easier to understand than the conventional
kind.</p>

<p>THE CHAIN OF OPERATION The git diff-* family works by
first comparing two sets of files:</p>

<p>&middot; git diff-index compares contents of a
&quot;tree&quot; object and the working directory (when
--cached flag is not used) or a &quot;tree&quot; object and
the index file (when --cached flag is used);</p>

<p>&middot; git diff-files compares contents of the index
file and the working directory;</p>

<p>&middot; git diff-tree compares contents of two
&quot;tree&quot; objects;</p>

<p>In all of these cases, the commands themselves first
optionally limit the two sets of files by any pathspecs
given on their command-lines, and compare corresponding
paths in the two resulting sets of files.</p>

<p>The pathspecs are used to limit the world diff operates
in. They remove the filepairs outside the specified sets of
pathnames. E.g. If the input set of filepairs included:</p>

<p>:100644 100644 bcd1234... 0123456... M junkfile</p>

<p>but the command invocation was git diff-files myfile,
then the junkfile entry would be removed from the list
because only &quot;myfile&quot; is under consideration.</p>

<p>The result of comparison is passed from these commands
to what is internally called &quot;diffcore&quot;, in a
format similar to what is output when the -p option is not
used. E.g.</p>

<p>in-place edit :100644 100644 bcd1234... 0123456... M
file0 create :000000 100644 0000000... 1234567... A file4
delete :100644 000000 1234567... 0000000... D file5 unmerged
:000000 000000 0000000... 0000000... U file6</p>

<p>The diffcore mechanism is fed a list of such comparison
results (each of which is called &quot;filepair&quot;,
although at this point each of them talks about a single
file), and transforms such a list into another list. There
are currently 5 such transformations:</p>

<p>&middot; diffcore-break</p>

<p>&middot; diffcore-rename</p>

<p>&middot; diffcore-merge-broken</p>

<p>&middot; diffcore-pickaxe</p>

<p>&middot; diffcore-order</p>

<p>These are applied in sequence. The set of filepairs git
diff-* commands find are used as the input to
diffcore-break, and the output from diffcore-break is used
as the input to the next transformation. The final result is
then passed to the output routine and generates either
diff-raw format (see Output format sections of the manual
for git diff-* commands) or diff-patch format.</p>

<p>DIFFCORE-BREAK: FOR SPLITTING UP COMPLETE
REWRITES&quot;&quot; The second transformation in the chain
is diffcore-break, and is controlled by the -B option to the
git diff-* commands. This is used to detect a filepair that
represents &quot;complete rewrite&quot; and break such
filepair into two filepairs that represent delete and
create. E.g. If the input contained this filepair:</p>

<p>:100644 100644 bcd1234... 0123456... M file0</p>

<p>and if it detects that the file &quot;file0&quot; is
completely rewritten, it changes it to:</p>

<p>:100644 000000 bcd1234... 0000000... D file0 :000000
100644 0000000... 0123456... A file0</p>

<p>For the purpose of breaking a filepair, diffcore-break
examines the extent of changes between the contents of the
files before and after modification (i.e. the contents that
have &quot;bcd1234...&quot; and &quot;0123456...&quot; as
their SHA1 content ID, in the above example). The amount of
deletion of original contents and insertion of new material
are added together, and if it exceeds the &quot;break
score&quot;, the filepair is broken into two. The break
score defaults to 50% of the size of the smaller of the
original and the result (i.e. if the edit shrinks the file,
the size of the result is used; if the edit lengthens the
file, the size of the original is used), and can be
customized by giving a number after &quot;-B&quot; option
(e.g. &quot;-B75&quot; to tell it to use 75%).</p>

<p>DIFFCORE-RENAME: FOR DETECTION RENAMES AND COPIES This
transformation is used to detect renames and copies, and is
controlled by the -M option (to detect renames) and the -C
option (to detect copies as well) to the git diff-*
commands. If the input contained these filepairs:</p>

<p>:100644 000000 0123456... 0000000... D fileX :000000
100644 0000000... 0123456... A file0</p>

<p>and the contents of the deleted file fileX is similar
enough to the contents of the created file file0, then
rename detection merges these filepairs and creates:</p>

<p>:100644 100644 0123456... 0123456... R100 fileX
file0</p>

<p>When the &quot;-C&quot; option is used, the original
contents of modified files, and deleted files (and also
unmodified files, if the &quot;--find-copies-harder&quot;
option is used) are considered as candidates of the source
files in rename/copy operation. If the input were like these
filepairs, that talk about a modified file fileY and a newly
created file file0:</p>

<p>:100644 100644 0123456... 1234567... M fileY :000000
100644 0000000... bcd3456... A file0</p>

<p>the original contents of fileY and the resulting
contents of file0 are compared, and if they are similar
enough, they are changed to:</p>

<p>:100644 100644 0123456... 1234567... M fileY :100644
100644 0123456... bcd3456... C100 fileY file0</p>

<p>In both rename and copy detection, the same &quot;extent
of changes&quot; algorithm used in diffcore-break is used to
determine if two files are &quot;similar enough&quot;, and
can be customized to use a similarity score different from
the default of 50% by giving a number after the
&quot;-M&quot; or &quot;-C&quot; option (e.g.
&quot;-M8&quot; to tell it to use 8/10 = 80%).</p>

<p>Note. When the &quot;-C&quot; option is used with
--find-copies-harder option, git diff-* commands feed
unmodified filepairs to diffcore mechanism as well as
modified ones. This lets the copy detector consider
unmodified files as copy source candidates at the expense of
making it slower. Without --find-copies-harder, git diff-*
commands can detect copies only if the file that was copied
happened to have been modified in the same changeset.</p>

<p>DIFFCORE-MERGE-BROKEN: FOR PUTTING COMPLETE
REWRITES&quot; BACK TOGETHER&quot; This transformation is
used to merge filepairs broken by diffcore-break, and not
transformed into rename/copy by diffcore-rename, back into a
single modification. This always runs when diffcore-break is
used.</p>

<p>For the purpose of merging broken filepairs back, it
uses a different &quot;extent of changes&quot; computation
from the ones used by diffcore-break and diffcore-rename. It
counts only the deletion from the original, and does not
count insertion. If you removed only 10 lines from a
100-line document, even if you added 910 new lines to make a
new 1000-line document, you did not do a complete rewrite.
diffcore-break breaks such a case in order to help
diffcore-rename to consider such filepairs as candidate of
rename/copy detection, but if filepairs broken that way were
not matched with other filepairs to create rename/copy, then
this transformation merges them back into the original
&quot;modification&quot;.</p>

<p>The &quot;extent of changes&quot; parameter can be
tweaked from the default 80% (that is, unless more than 80%
of the original material is deleted, the broken pairs are
merged back into a single modification) by giving a second
number to -B option, like these:</p>

<p>&middot; -B50/60 (give 50% &quot;break score&quot; to
diffcore-break, use 60% for diffcore-merge-broken).</p>

<p>&middot; -B/60 (the same as above, since diffcore-break
defaults to 50%).</p>

<p>Note that earlier implementation left a broken pair as a
separate creation and deletion patches. This was an
unnecessary hack and the latest implementation always merges
all the broken pairs back into modifications, but the
resulting patch output is formatted differently for easier
review in case of such a complete rewrite by showing the
entire contents of old version prefixed with -, followed by
the entire contents of new version prefixed with +.</p>

<p>DIFFCORE-PICKAXE: FOR DETECTING ADDITION/DELETION OF
SPECIFIED STRING This transformation is used to find
filepairs that represent changes that touch a specified
string, and is controlled by the -S option and the
--pickaxe-all option to the git diff-* commands.</p>

<p>When diffcore-pickaxe is in use, it checks if there are
filepairs whose &quot;original&quot; side has the specified
string and whose &quot;result&quot; side does not. Such a
filepair represents &quot;the string appeared in this
changeset&quot;. It also checks for the opposite case that
loses the specified string.</p>

<p>When --pickaxe-all is not in effect, diffcore-pickaxe
leaves only such filepairs that touch the specified string
in its output. When --pickaxe-all is used, diffcore-pickaxe
leaves all filepairs intact if there is such a filepair, or
makes the output empty otherwise. The latter behaviour is
designed to make reviewing of the changes in the context of
the whole changeset easier.</p>

<p>DIFFCORE-ORDER: FOR SORTING THE OUTPUT BASED ON
FILENAMES This is used to reorder the filepairs according to
the users (or projects) taste, and is controlled by the -O
option to the git diff-* commands.</p>

<p>This takes a text file each of whose lines is a shell
glob pattern. Filepairs that match a glob pattern on an
earlier line in the file are output before ones that match a
later line, and filepairs that do not match any glob pattern
are output last.</p>

<p>As an example, a typical orderfile for the core git
probably would look like this:</p>

<p>README Makefile Documentation *.h *.c t</p>
