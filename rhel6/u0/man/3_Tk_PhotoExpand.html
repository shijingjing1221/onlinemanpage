<p>DESCRIPTION Tk_FindPhoto returns an opaque handle that
is used to identify a par- ticular photo image to the other
procedures. The parameter is the name of the image, that is,
the name specified to the image create photo command, or
assigned by that command if no name was specified.</p>

<p>Tk_PhotoPutBlock is used to supply blocks of image data
to be dis- played. The call affects an area of the image of
size width x height pixels, with its top-left corner at
coordinates (x,y). All of width, height, x, and y must be
non-negative. If part of this area lies out- side the
current bounds of the image, the image will be expanded to
include the area, unless the user has specified an explicit
image size with the -width and/or -height widget
configuration options (see photo(n)); in that case the area
is silently clipped to the image boundaries.</p>

<p>The block parameter is a pointer to a Tk_PhotoImageBlock
structure, defined as follows: typedef struct { unsigned
char *pixelPtr; int width; int height; int pitch; int
pixelSize; int offset[4]; } Tk_PhotoImageBlock; The pixelPtr
field points to the first pixel, that is, the top-left pixel
in the block. The width and height fields specify the
dimensions of the block of pixels. The pixelSize field
specifies the address dif- ference between two horizontally
adjacent pixels. Often it is 3 or 4, but it can have any
value. The pitch field specifies the address dif- ference
between two vertically adjacent pixels. The offset array
con- tains the offsets from the address of a pixel to the
addresses of the bytes containing the red, green, blue and
alpha (transparency) compo- nents. These are normally 0, 1,
2 and 3, but can have other values, e.g., for images that
are stored as separate red, green and blue planes.</p>

<p>The compRule parameter to Tk_PhotoPutBlock specifies a
compositing rule that says what to do with transparent
pixels. The value TK_PHOTO_COM- POSITE_OVERLAY says that the
previous contents of the photo image should show through,
and the value TK_PHOTO_COMPOSITE_SET says that the previous
contents of the photo image should be completely ignored,
and the values from the block be copied directly across. The
behavior in Tk8.3 and earlier was equivalent to having
TK_PHOTO_COMPOSITE_OVERLAY as a compositing rule.</p>

<p>The value given for the width and height parameters to
Tk_PhotoPutBlock do not have to correspond to the values
specified in block. If they are smaller, Tk_PhotoPutBlock
extracts a sub-block from the image data supplied. If they
are larger, the data given are replicated (in a tiled
fashion) to fill the specified area. These rules operate
inde- pendently in the horizontal and vertical
directions.</p>

<p>Tk_PhotoPutBlock normally returns TCL_OK, though if it
cannot allocate sufficient memory to hold the resulting
image, TCL_ERROR is returned instead and, if the interp
argument is non-NULL, an error message is placed in the
interpreters result.</p>

<p>Tk_PhotoPutZoomedBlock works like Tk_PhotoPutBlock
except that the image can be reduced or enlarged for
display. The subsampleX and sub- sampleY parameters allow
the size of the image to be reduced by subsam- pling.
Tk_PhotoPutZoomedBlock will use only pixels from the input
image whose X coordinates are multiples of subsampleX, and
whose Y coordinates are multiples of subsampleY. For
example, an image of 512x512 pixels can be reduced to
256x256 by setting subsampleX and sub- sampleY to 2.</p>

<p>The zoomX and zoomY parameters allow the image to be
enlarged by pixel replication. Each pixel of the (possibly
subsampled) input image will be written to a block zoomX
pixels wide and zoomY pixels high of the displayed image.
Subsampling and zooming can be used together for spe- cial
effects.</p>

<p>Tk_PhotoGetImage can be used to retrieve image data from
a photo image. Tk_PhotoGetImage fills in the structure
pointed to by the blockPtr parameter with values that
describe the address and layout of the image data that the
photo image has stored internally. The values are valid
until the image is destroyed or its size is changed.
Tk_PhotoGetImage returns 1 for compatibility with the
corresponding procedure in the old photo widget.</p>

<p>Tk_PhotoBlank blanks the entire area of the photo image.
Blank areas of a photo image are transparent.</p>

<p>Tk_PhotoExpand requests that the widgets image be
expanded to be at least width x height pixels in size. The
width and/or height are unchanged if the user has specified
an explicit image width or height with the -width and/or
-height configuration options, respectively. If the image
data are being supplied in many small blocks, it is more
efficient to use Tk_PhotoExpand or Tk_PhotoSetSize at the
beginning rather than allowing the image to expand in many
small increments as image blocks are supplied.</p>

<p>Tk_PhotoExpand normally returns TCL_OK, though if it
cannot allocate sufficient memory to hold the resulting
image, TCL_ERROR is returned instead and, if the interp
argument is non-NULL, an error message is placed in the
interpreters result.</p>

<p>Tk_PhotoSetSize specifies the size of the image, as if
the user had specified the given width and height values to
the -width and -height configuration options. A value of
zero for width or height does not change the images width or
height, but allows the width or height to be changed by
subsequent calls to Tk_PhotoPutBlock, Tk_PhotoPutZoomed-
Block or Tk_PhotoExpand.</p>

<p>Tk_PhotoSetSize normally returns TCL_OK, though if it
cannot allocate sufficient memory to hold the resulting
image, TCL_ERROR is returned instead and, if the interp
argument is non-NULL, an error message is placed in the
interpreters result.</p>

<p>Tk_PhotoGetSize returns the dimensions of the image in
*widthPtr and *heightPtr.</p>

<p>PORTABILITY In Tk 8.3 and earlier, Tk_PhotoPutBlock and
Tk_PhotoPutZoomedBlock had different signatures. If you want
to compile code that uses the old interface against 8.4
without updating your code, compile it with the flag
-DUSE_COMPOSITELESS_PHOTO_PUT_BLOCK. Code linked using Stubs
against older versions of Tk will continue to work.</p>

<p>In Tk 8.4, Tk_PhotoPutBlock, Tk_PhotoPutZoomedBlock,
Tk_PhotoExpand and Tk_PhotoSetSize did not take an interp
argument or return any result code. If insufficient memory
was available for an image, Tk would panic. This behaviour
is still supported if you compile your extension with the
additional flag -DUSE_PANIC_ON_PHOTO_ALLOC_FAILURE. Code
linked using Stubs against older versions of Tk will
continue to work.</p>

<p>CREDITS The code for the photo image type was developed
by Paul Mackerras, based on his earlier photo widget
code.</p>
