<p>AMLABEL(8) System Administration Commands AMLABEL(8)</p>

<p>NAME amlabel - label an Amanda tape</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS amlabel [-f] config label [slot slot] [-o
configoption]...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION All Amanda tapes must be pre-labeled before
they are used. Amanda verifies the label in amdump and
amflush before writing to make sure the proper tape is
loaded.</p>

<p>Amlabel writes an Amanda label on the tape in the device
specified by the amanda.conf file in
/usr/local/etc/amanda/config. Label may be any string that
does not contain whitespace and that matches the amanda.conf
labelstr regular expression option. It is up to the system
administrator to define a naming convention.</p>

<p>Amlabel appends the new tape to the tapelist(5) file so
it will be used by Amanda before it reuses any other tapes.
When you amlabel multiple tapes, they will be used in the
order you amlabel them.</p>

<p>Amlabel will not write the label if the tape contains an
active Amanda tape or if the label specified is on an active
tape. The -f (force) flag bypasses these verifications.</p>

<p>An optional slot may be specified after the tape label.
If a tape changer is in use, amlabel will label the tape in
the specified slot instead of the currently loaded tape.</p>

<p>See the amanda(8) man page for more details about
Amanda.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -o configoption See the &quot;CONFIGURATION
OVERRIDE&quot; section in amanda(8).</p>

<p>EXAMPLE Write an Amanda label with the string
&quot;DMP000&quot; on the tape loaded in the device named in
the tapedev option in
/usr/local/etc/amanda/daily/amanda.conf: % amlabel daily
DMP000</p>

<p>Label the tape in slot 3 of the currently configured
tape changer with the string &quot;DMP003&quot;: % amlabel
daily DMP003 slot 3</p>

<p>MESSAGES label label doesn&acute;t match labelstr str
Label label on the command line does not match the labelstr
regular expression str from amanda.conf.</p>

<p>label label already on a tape Label label is already
listed as an active Amanda tape.</p>

<p>no tpchanger specified in path , so slot command invalid
The command line has the slot parameter but the amanda.conf
file in path does not have a tape changer configured.</p>

<p>reading label label, tape is in another amanda
configuration This tape appears to be a valid Amanda tape,
but label does not match labelstr for this configuration so
it is probably part of a different Amanda configuration.</p>

<p>reading label label, tape is active Tape label appears
to already be part of this Amanda configuration and active,
i.e. has valid data on it.</p>

<p>no label found, are you sure tape is non-rewinding?
While checking that the label was written correctly, amlabel
got an error that might be caused by mis-configuring Amanda
with a rewinding tape device name instead of a non-rewinding
device name for tape.</p>
