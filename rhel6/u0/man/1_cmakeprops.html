<p>NAME cmakeprops - Reference of CMake properties.</p>

<p>PROPERTIES CMake Properties - Properties supported by
CMake, the Cross-Platform Makefile Generator.</p>

<p>This is the documentation for the properties supported
by CMake. Prop- erties can have different scopes. They can
either be assigned to a source file, a directory, a target
or globally to CMake. By modifying the values of properties
the behaviour of the build system can be cus- tomized.</p>

<p>PROPERTIES OF GLOBAL SCOPE
ALLOW_DUPLICATE_CUSTOM_TARGETS Allow duplicate custom
targets to be created.</p>

<p>Normally CMake requires that all targets built in a
project have globally unique logical names (see policy
CMP0002). This is necessary to generate meaningful project
file names in Xcode and VS IDE generators. It also allows
the target names to be refer- enced unambiguously.</p>

<p>Makefile generators are capable of supporting duplicate
custom target names. For projects that care only about
Makefile gener- ators and do not wish to support Xcode or VS
IDE generators, one may set this property to true to allow
duplicate custom targets. The property allows multiple
add_custom_target command calls in different directories to
specify the same target name. However, setting this property
will cause non-Makefile generators to pro- duce an error and
refuse to generate the project.</p>

<p>DEBUG_CONFIGURATIONS Specify which configurations are
for debugging.</p>

<p>The value must be a semi-colon separated list of
configuration names. Currently this property is used only by
the tar- get_link_libraries command (see its documentation
for details). Additional uses may be defined in the
future.</p>

<p>This property must be set at the top level of the
project and before the first target_link_libraries command
invocation. If any entry in the list does not match a valid
configuration for the project the behavior is undefined.</p>

<p>DISABLED_FEATURES List of features which are disabled
during the CMake run.</p>

<p>List of features which are disabled during the CMake
run. Be default it contains the names of all packages which
were not found. This is determined using the
&lt;NAME&gt;_FOUND variables. Packages which are searched
QUIET are not listed. A project can add its own features to
this list.This property is used by the macros in
FeatureSummary.cmake.</p>

<p>ENABLED_FEATURES List of features which are enabled
during the CMake run.</p>

<p>List of features which are enabled during the CMake run.
Be default it contains the names of all packages which were
found. This is determined using the &lt;NAME&gt;_FOUND
variables. Packages which are searched QUIET are not listed.
A project can add its own features to this list.This
property is used by the macros in FeatureSummary.cmake.</p>

<p>ENABLED_LANGUAGES Read-only property that contains the
list of currently enabled languages</p>

<p>Set to list of currently enabled lanauges.</p>

<p>FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIB64_PATHS Whether FIND_LIBRARY should
automatically search lib64 directo- ries.</p>

<p>FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIB64_PATHS is a boolean specifying
whether the FIND_LIBRARY command should automatically search
the lib64 vari- ant of directories called lib in the search
path when building 64-bit binaries.</p>

<p>GLOBAL_DEPENDS_DEBUG_MODE Enable global target
dependency graph debug mode.</p>

<p>CMake automatically analyzes the global inter-target
dependency graph at the beginning of native build system
generation. This property causes it to display details of
its analysis to stderr.</p>

<p>IN_TRY_COMPILE Read-only property that is true during a
try-compile configura- tion.</p>

<p>True when building a project inside a TRY_COMPILE or
TRY_RUN command.</p>

<p>PACKAGES_FOUND List of packages which were found during
the CMake run.</p>

<p>List of packages which were found during the CMake run.
Whether a package has been found is determined using the
&lt;NAME&gt;_FOUND variables.</p>

<p>PACKAGES_NOT_FOUND List of packages which were not found
during the CMake run.</p>

<p>List of packages which were not found during the CMake
run. Whether a package has been found is determined using
the &lt;NAME&gt;_FOUND variables.</p>

<p>REPORT_UNDEFINED_PROPERTIES If set, report any undefined
properties to this file.</p>

<p>If this property is set to a filename then when CMake
runs it will report any properties or variables that were
accessed but not defined into the filename specified in this
property.</p>

<p>TARGET_ARCHIVES_MAY_BE_SHARED_LIBS Set if shared
libraries may be named like archives.</p>

<p>On AIX shared libraries may be named
&quot;lib&lt;name&gt;.a&quot;. This prop- erty is set to
true on such platforms.</p>

<p>TARGET_SUPPORTS_SHARED_LIBS Does the target platform
support shared libraries.</p>

<p>TARGET_SUPPORTS_SHARED_LIBS is a boolean specifying
whether the target platform supports shared libraries.
Basically all current general general purpose OS do so, the
exception are usually embedded systems with no or special
OSs.</p>

<p>__CMAKE_DELETE_CACHE_CHANGE_VARS_ Internal property</p>

<p>Used to detect compiler changes, Do not set.</p>

<p>PROPERTIES ON DIRECTORIES ADDITIONAL_MAKE_CLEAN_FILES
Additional files to clean during the make clean stage.</p>

<p>A list of files that will be cleaned as a part of the
&quot;make clean&quot; stage.</p>

<p>CACHE_VARIABLES List of cache variables available in the
current directory.</p>

<p>This read-only property specifies the list of CMake
cache vari- ables currently defined. It is intended for
debugging purposes.</p>

<p>CLEAN_NO_CUSTOM Should the output of custom commands be
left.</p>

<p>If this is true then the outputs of custom commands for
this directory will not be removed during the &quot;make
clean&quot; stage.</p>

<p>COMPILE_DEFINITIONS Preprocessor definitions for
compiling a directorys sources.</p>

<p>The COMPILE_DEFINITIONS property may be set to a list of
prepro- cessor definitions using the syntax VAR or
VAR=value. Func- tion-style definitions are not supported.
CMake will automati- cally escape the value correctly for
the native build system (note that CMake language syntax may
require escapes to specify some values). This property may
be set on a per-configuration basis using the name
COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_&lt;CONFIG&gt; where &lt;CONFIG&gt; is
an upper-case name (ex.
&quot;COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_DEBUG&quot;). This property will
be initialized in each directory by its value in the
directorys parent.</p>

<p>CMake will automatically drop some definitions that are
not sup- ported by the native build tool. The VS6 IDE does
not support definition values with spaces (but NMake
does).</p>

<p>Dislaimer: Most native build tools have poor support for
escap- ing certain values. CMake has work-arounds for many
cases but some values may just not be possible to pass
correctly. If a value does not seem to be escaped correctly,
do not attempt to work-around the problem by adding escape
sequences to the value. Your work-around may break in a
future version of CMake that has improved escape support.
Instead consider defining the macro in a (configured) header
file. Then report the limitation.</p>

<p>COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_&lt;CONFIG&gt; Per-configuration
preprocessor definitions in a directory.</p>

<p>This is the configuration-specific version of
COMPILE_DEFINI- TIONS. This property will be initialized in
each directory by its value in the directorys parent.</p>

<p>DEFINITIONS For CMake 2.4 compatibility only. Use
COMPILE_DEFINITIONS instead.</p>

<p>This read-only property specifies the list of flags
given so far to the add_definitions command. It is intended
for debugging purposes. Use the COMPILE_DEFINITIONS
instead.</p>

<p>EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL Exclude the directory from the all
target of its parent.</p>

<p>A property on a directory that indicates if its targets
are excluded from the default build target. If it is not,
then with a Makefile for example typing make will cause the
targets to be built. The same concept applies to the default
build of other generators.</p>

<p>IMPLICIT_DEPENDS_INCLUDE_TRANSFORM Specify #include line
transforms for dependencies in a direc- tory.</p>

<p>This property specifies rules to transform macro-like
#include lines during implicit dependency scanning of C and
C++ source files. The list of rules must be
semicolon-separated with each entry of the form
&quot;A_MACRO(%)=value-with-%&quot; (the % must be lit-
eral). During dependency scanning occurrences of
A_MACRO(...) on #include lines will be replaced by the value
given with the macro argument substituted for %. For
example, the entry</p>

<p>MYDIR(%)=&lt;mydir/%&gt;</p>

<p>will convert lines of the form</p>

<p>#include MYDIR(myheader.h)</p>

<p>to</p>

<p>#include &lt;mydir/myheader.h&gt;</p>

<p>allowing the dependency to be followed.</p>

<p>This property applies to sources in all targets within a
direc- tory. The property value is initialized in each
directory by its value in the directorys parent.</p>

<p>INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES List of preprocessor include file
search directories.</p>

<p>This read-only property specifies the list of
directories given so far to the include_directories command.
It is intended for debugging purposes.</p>

<p>INCLUDE_REGULAR_EXPRESSION Include file scanning regular
expression.</p>

<p>This read-only property specifies the regular expression
used during dependency scanning to match include files that
should be followed. See the include_regular_expression
command.</p>

<p>LINK_DIRECTORIES List of linker search directories.</p>

<p>This read-only property specifies the list of
directories given so far to the link_directories command. It
is intended for debugging purposes.</p>

<p>LISTFILE_STACK The current stack of listfiles being
processed.</p>

<p>This property is mainly useful when trying to debug
errors in your CMake scripts. It returns a list of what list
files are currently being processed, in order. So if one
listfile does an INCLUDE command then that is effectively
pushing the included listfile onto the stack.</p>

<p>MACROS List of macro commands available in the current
directory.</p>

<p>This read-only property specifies the list of CMake
macros cur- rently defined. It is intended for debugging
purposes. See the macro command.</p>

<p>PARENT_DIRECTORY Source directory that added current
subdirectory.</p>

<p>This read-only property specifies the source directory
that added the current source directory as a subdirectory of
the build. In the top-level directory the value is the
empty-string.</p>

<p>TEST_INCLUDE_FILE A cmake file that will be included
when ctest is run.</p>

<p>If you specify TEST_INCLUDE_FILE, that file will be
included and processed when ctest is run on the
directory.</p>

<p>VARIABLES List of variables defined in the current
directory.</p>

<p>This read-only property specifies the list of CMake
variables currently defined. It is intended for debugging
purposes.</p>

<p>PROPERTIES ON TARGETS &lt;CONFIG&gt;_POSTFIX Postfix to
append to the target file name for configuration
&lt;CONFIG&gt;.</p>

<p>When building with configuration &lt;CONFIG&gt; the
value of this property is appended to the target file name
built on disk. For non-executable targets, this property is
initialized by the value of the variable
CMAKE_&lt;CONFIG&gt;_POSTFIX if it is set when a target is
created. This property is ignored on the Mac for Frameworks
and App Bundles.</p>

<p>ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY Output directory in which to
build ARCHIVE target files.</p>

<p>This property specifies the directory into which archive
target files should be built. There are three kinds of
target files that may be built: archive, library, and
runtime. Executables are always treated as runtime targets.
Static libraries are always treated as archive targets.
Module libraries are always treated as library targets. For
non-DLL platforms shared libraries are treated as library
targets. For DLL platforms the DLL part of a shared library
is treated as a runtime target and the corresponding import
library is treated as an archive tar- get. All Windows-based
systems including Cygwin are DLL plat- forms. This property
is initialized by the value of the variable
CMAKE_ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY if it is set when a target is
created.</p>

<p>BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH Should build tree targets have
install tree rpaths.</p>

<p>BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH is a boolean specifying whether
to link the target in the build tree with the INSTALL_RPATH.
This takes precedence over SKIP_BUILD_RPATH and avoids the
need for relink- ing before installation. This property is
initialized by the value of the variable
CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH if it is set when a target is
created.</p>

<p>CLEAN_DIRECT_OUTPUT Do not delete other variants of this
target.</p>

<p>When a library is built CMake by default generates code
to remove any existing library using all possible names.
This is needed to support libraries that switch between
STATIC and SHARED by a user option. However when using
OUTPUT_NAME to build a static and shared library of the same
name using differ- ent logical target names the two targets
will remove each others files. This can be prevented by
setting the CLEAN_DIRECT_OUTPUT property to 1.</p>

<p>COMPILE_DEFINITIONS Preprocessor definitions for
compiling a targets sources.</p>

<p>The COMPILE_DEFINITIONS property may be set to a list of
prepro- cessor definitions using the syntax VAR or
VAR=value. Func- tion-style definitions are not supported.
CMake will automati- cally escape the value correctly for
the native build system (note that CMake language syntax may
require escapes to specify some values). This property may
be set on a per-configuration basis using the name
COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_&lt;CONFIG&gt; where &lt;CONFIG&gt; is
an upper-case name (ex.
&quot;COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_DEBUG&quot;).</p>

<p>CMake will automatically drop some definitions that are
not sup- ported by the native build tool. The VS6 IDE does
not support definition values with spaces (but NMake
does).</p>

<p>Dislaimer: Most native build tools have poor support for
escap- ing certain values. CMake has work-arounds for many
cases but some values may just not be possible to pass
correctly. If a value does not seem to be escaped correctly,
do not attempt to work-around the problem by adding escape
sequences to the value. Your work-around may break in a
future version of CMake that has improved escape support.
Instead consider defining the macro in a (configured) header
file. Then report the limitation.</p>

<p>COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_&lt;CONFIG&gt; Per-configuration
preprocessor definitions on a target.</p>

<p>This is the configuration-specific version of
COMPILE_DEFINI- TIONS.</p>

<p>COMPILE_FLAGS Additional flags to use when compiling
this targets sources.</p>

<p>The COMPILE_FLAGS property sets additional compiler
flags used to build sources within the target. Use
COMPILE_DEFINITIONS to pass additional preprocessor
definitions.</p>

<p>DEBUG_POSTFIX See target property
&lt;CONFIG&gt;_POSTFIX.</p>

<p>This property is a special case of the more-general
&lt;CON- FIG&gt;_POSTFIX property for the DEBUG
configuration.</p>

<p>DEFINE_SYMBOL Define a symbol when compiling this target
s sources.</p>

<p>DEFINE_SYMBOL sets the name of the preprocessor symbol
defined when compiling sources in a shared library. If not
set here then it is set to target_EXPORTS by default (with
some substitutions if the target is not a valid C
identifier). This is useful for headers to know whether they
are being included from inside their library our outside to
properly setup dllexport/dllimport decorations.</p>

<p>ENABLE_EXPORTS Specify whether an executable exports
symbols for loadable mod- ules.</p>

<p>Normally an executable does not export any symbols
because it is the final program. It is possible for an
executable to export symbols to be used by loadable modules.
When this property is set to true CMake will allow other
targets to &quot;link&quot; to the exe- cutable with the
TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES command. On all plat- forms a
target-level dependency on the executable is created for
targets that link to it. For non-DLL platforms the link rule
is simply ignored since the dynamic loader will
automatically bind symbols when the module is loaded. For
DLL platforms an import library will be created for the
exported symbols and then used for linking. All
Windows-based systems including Cygwin are DLL
platforms.</p>

<p>EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL Exclude the target from the all
target.</p>

<p>A property on a target that indicates if the target is
excluded from the default build target. If it is not, then
with a Make- file for example typing make will cause this
target to be built. The same concept applies to the default
build of other genera- tors. Installing a target with
EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL set to true has undefined behavior.</p>

<p>EchoString A message to be displayed when the target is
built.</p>

<p>A message to display on some generators (such as
makefiles) when the target is built.</p>

<p>FRAMEWORK This target is a framework on the Mac.</p>

<p>If a shared library target has this property set to true
it will be built as a framework when built on the mac. It
will have the directory structure required for a framework
and will be suit- able to be used with the -framework
option</p>

<p>Fortran_MODULE_DIRECTORY Specify output directory for
Fortran modules provided by the target.</p>

<p>If the target contains Fortran source files that provide
modules and the compiler supports a module output directory
this speci- fies the directory in which the modules will be
placed. When this property is not set the modules will be
placed in the build directory corresponding to the targets
source directory. If the variable
CMAKE_Fortran_MODULE_DIRECTORY is set when a target is
created its value is used to initialize this property.</p>

<p>GENERATOR_FILE_NAME Generators file for this target.</p>

<p>An internal property used by some generators to record
the name of project or dsp file associated with this
target.</p>

<p>HAS_CXX Force a target to use the CXX linker.</p>

<p>Setting HAS_CXX on a target will force the target to use
the C++ linker (and C++ runtime libraries) for linking even
if the tar- get has no C++ code in it.</p>

<p>IMPLICIT_DEPENDS_INCLUDE_TRANSFORM Specify #include line
transforms for dependencies in a target.</p>

<p>This property specifies rules to transform macro-like
#include lines during implicit dependency scanning of C and
C++ source files. The list of rules must be
semicolon-separated with each entry of the form
&quot;A_MACRO(%)=value-with-%&quot; (the % must be lit-
eral). During dependency scanning occurrences of
A_MACRO(...) on #include lines will be replaced by the value
given with the macro argument substituted for %. For
example, the entry</p>

<p>MYDIR(%)=&lt;mydir/%&gt;</p>

<p>will convert lines of the form</p>

<p>#include MYDIR(myheader.h)</p>

<p>to</p>

<p>#include &lt;mydir/myheader.h&gt;</p>

<p>allowing the dependency to be followed.</p>

<p>This property applies to sources in the target on which
it is set.</p>

<p>IMPORTED Read-only indication of whether a target is
IMPORTED.</p>

<p>The boolean value of this property is true for targets
created with the IMPORTED option to add_executable or
add_library. It is false for targets built within the
project.</p>

<p>IMPORTED_CONFIGURATIONS Configurations provided for an
IMPORTED target.</p>

<p>Lists configuration names available for an IMPORTED
target. The names correspond to configurations defined in
the project from which the target is imported. If the
importing project uses a different set of configurations the
names may be mapped using the
MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_&lt;CONFIG&gt; property. Ignored for
non-imported targets.</p>

<p>IMPORTED_IMPLIB Full path to the import library for an
IMPORTED target.</p>

<p>Specifies the location of the &quot;.lib&quot; part of a
windows DLL. Ignored for non-imported targets.</p>

<p>IMPORTED_IMPLIB_&lt;CONFIG&gt; Per-configuration version
of IMPORTED_IMPLIB property.</p>

<p>This property is used when loading settings for the
&lt;CONFIG&gt; configuration of an imported target.
Configuration names corre- spond to those provided by the
project from which the target is imported.</p>

<p>IMPORTED_LINK_DEPENDENT_LIBRARIES Dependent shared
libraries of an imported shared library.</p>

<p>Shared libraries may be linked to other shared libraries
as part of their implementation. On some platforms the
linker searches for the dependent libraries of shared
libraries they are includ- ing in the link. This property
lists the dependent shared libraries of an imported library.
The list should be disjoint from the list of interface
libraries in the IMPORTED_LINK_INTER- FACE_LIBRARIES
property. On platforms requiring dependent shared libraries
to be found at link time CMake uses this list to add
appropriate files or paths to the link command line. Ignored
for non-imported targets.</p>

<p>IMPORTED_LINK_DEPENDENT_LIBRARIES_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
Per-configuration version of
IMPORTED_LINK_DEPENDENT_LIBRARIES.</p>

<p>This property is used when loading settings for the
&lt;CONFIG&gt; configuration of an imported target.
Configuration names corre- spond to those provided by the
project from which the target is imported. If set, this
property completely overrides the generic property for the
named configuration.</p>

<p>IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES Transitive link
interface of an IMPORTED target.</p>

<p>Lists libraries whose interface is included when an
IMPORTED library target is linked to another target. The
libraries will be included on the link line for the target.
Unlike the LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES property, this property
applies to all imported target types, including STATIC
libraries. This prop- erty is ignored for non-imported
targets.</p>

<p>IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
Per-configuration version of
IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES.</p>

<p>This property is used when loading settings for the
&lt;CONFIG&gt; configuration of an imported target.
Configuration names corre- spond to those provided by the
project from which the target is imported. If set, this
property completely overrides the generic property for the
named configuration.</p>

<p>IMPORTED_LOCATION Full path to the main file on disk for
an IMPORTED target.</p>

<p>Specifies the location of an IMPORTED target file on
disk. For executables this is the location of the executable
file. For bundles on OS X this is the location of the
executable file inside Contents/MacOS under the application
bundle folder. For static libraries and modules this is the
location of the library or module. For shared libraries on
non-DLL platforms this is the location of the shared
library. For frameworks on OS X this is the location of the
library file symlink just inside the framework folder. For
DLLs this is the location of the &quot;.dll&quot; part of
the library. For UNKNOWN libraries this is the location of
the file to be linked. Ignored for non-imported targets.</p>

<p>IMPORTED_LOCATION_&lt;CONFIG&gt; Per-configuration
version of IMPORTED_LOCATION property.</p>

<p>This property is used when loading settings for the
&lt;CONFIG&gt; configuration of an imported target.
Configuration names corre- spond to those provided by the
project from which the target is imported.</p>

<p>IMPORTED_SONAME The &quot;soname&quot; of an IMPORTED
target of shared library type.</p>

<p>Specifies the &quot;soname&quot; embedded in an imported
shared library. This is meaningful only on platforms
supporting the feature. Ignored for non-imported
targets.</p>

<p>IMPORTED_SONAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt; Per-configuration version
of IMPORTED_SONAME property.</p>

<p>This property is used when loading settings for the
&lt;CONFIG&gt; configuration of an imported target.
Configuration names corre- spond to those provided by the
project from which the target is imported.</p>

<p>IMPORT_PREFIX What comes before the import library
name.</p>

<p>Similar to the target property PREFIX, but used for
import libraries (typically corresponding to a DLL) instead
of regular libraries. A target property that can be set to
override the prefix (such as &quot;lib&quot;) on an import
library name.</p>

<p>IMPORT_SUFFIX What comes after the import library
name.</p>

<p>Similar to the target property SUFFIX, but used for
import libraries (typically corresponding to a DLL) instead
of regular libraries. A target property that can be set to
override the suffix (such as &quot;.lib&quot;) on an import
library name.</p>

<p>INSTALL_NAME_DIR Mac OSX directory name for installed
targets.</p>

<p>INSTALL_NAME_DIR is a string specifying the directory
portion of the &quot;install_name&quot; field of shared
libraries on Mac OSX to use in the installed targets.</p>

<p>INSTALL_RPATH The rpath to use for installed
targets.</p>

<p>A semicolon-separated list specifying the rpath to use
in installed targets (for platforms that support it). This
prop- erty is initialized by the value of the variable
CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH if it is set when a target is
created.</p>

<p>INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH Add paths to linker search
and installed rpath.</p>

<p>INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH is a boolean that if set to
true will append directories in the linker search path and
outside the project to the INSTALL_RPATH. This property is
initialized by the value of the variable
CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH if it is set when a target
is created.</p>

<p>LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY Output directory in which to
build LIBRARY target files.</p>

<p>This property specifies the directory into which library
target files should be built. There are three kinds of
target files that may be built: archive, library, and
runtime. Executables are always treated as runtime targets.
Static libraries are always treated as archive targets.
Module libraries are always treated as library targets. For
non-DLL platforms shared libraries are treated as library
targets. For DLL platforms the DLL part of a shared library
is treated as a runtime target and the corresponding import
library is treated as an archive tar- get. All Windows-based
systems including Cygwin are DLL plat- forms. This property
is initialized by the value of the variable
CMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY if it is set when a target is
created.</p>

<p>LINKER_LANGUAGE What tool to use for linking, based on
language.</p>

<p>The LINKER_LANGUAGE property is used to change the tool
used to link an executable or shared library. The default is
set the language to match the files in the library. CXX and
C are common values for this property.</p>

<p>LINK_FLAGS Additional flags to use when linking this
target.</p>

<p>The LINK_FLAGS property can be used to add extra flags
to the link step of a target. LINK_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt; will
add to the con- figuration &lt;CONFIG&gt;, for example,
DEBUG, RELEASE, MINSIZEREL, RELWITHDEBINFO.</p>

<p>LINK_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt; Per-configuration linker flags
for a target.</p>

<p>This is the configuration-specific version of
LINK_FLAGS.</p>

<p>LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES List public interface libraries
for a shared library or exe- cutable.</p>

<p>By default linking to a shared library target
transitively links to targets with which the library itself
was linked. For an executable with exports (see the
ENABLE_EXPORTS property) no default transitive link
dependencies are used. This property replaces the default
transitive link dependencies with an explict list. When the
target is linked into another target the libraries listed
(and recursively their link interface libraries) will be
provided to the other target also. If the list is empty then
no transitive link dependencies will be incorporated when
this target is linked into another target even if the
default set is non-empty. This property is ignored for
STATIC libraries.</p>

<p>LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
Per-configuration list of public interface libraries for a
tar- get.</p>

<p>This is the configuration-specific version of
LINK_INTER- FACE_LIBRARIES. If set, this property completely
overrides the generic property for the named
configuration.</p>

<p>LINK_SEARCH_END_STATIC End a link line such that static
system libraries are used.</p>

<p>Some linkers support switches such as -Bstatic and
-Bdynamic to determine whether to use static or shared
libraries for -lXXX options. CMake uses these options to set
the link type for libraries whose full paths are not known
or (in some cases) are in implicit link directories for the
platform. By default the linker search type is left at
-Bdynamic by the end of the library list. This property
switches the final linker search type to -Bstatic.</p>

<p>LOCATION Read-only location of a target on disk.</p>

<p>For an imported target, this read-only property returns
the value of the LOCATION_&lt;CONFIG&gt; property for an
unspecified con- figuration &lt;CONFIG&gt; provided by the
target.</p>

<p>For a non-imported target, this property is provided for
compat- ibility with CMake 2.4 and below. It was meant to
get the loca- tion of an executable targets output file for
use in add_cus- tom_command. The path may contain a
build-system-specific por- tion that is replaced at build
time with the configuration get- ting built (such as
&quot;$(ConfigurationName)&quot; in VS). In CMake 2.6 and
above add_custom_command automatically recognizes a target
name in its COMMAND and DEPENDS options and computes the
target location. Therefore this property is not needed for
creating custom commands.</p>

<p>LOCATION_&lt;CONFIG&gt; Read-only property providing a
target location on disk.</p>

<p>A read-only property that indicates where a targets main
file is located on disk for the configuration
&lt;CONFIG&gt;. The property is defined only for library and
executable targets. An imported target may provide a set of
configurations different from that of the importing project.
By default CMake looks for an exact-match but otherwise uses
an arbitrary available configura- tion. Use the
MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_&lt;CONFIG&gt; property to map imported
configurations explicitly.</p>

<p>MACOSX_BUNDLE Build an executable as an application
bundle on Mac OS X.</p>

<p>When this property is set to true the executable when
built on Mac OS X will be created as an application bundle.
This makes it a GUI executable that can be launched from the
Finder. See the MACOSX_BUNDLE_INFO_PLIST target property for
information about creation of the Info.plist file for the
application bun- dle.</p>

<p>MACOSX_BUNDLE_INFO_PLIST Specify a custom Info.plist
template for a Mac OS X App Bundle.</p>

<p>An executable target with MACOSX_BUNDLE enabled will be
built as an application bundle on Mac OS X. By default its
Info.plist file is created by configuring a template called
MacOSXBundle- Info.plist.in located in the
CMAKE_MODULE_PATH. This property specifies an alternative
template file name which may be a full path.</p>

<p>The following target properties may be set to specify
content to be configured into the file:</p>

<p>MACOSX_BUNDLE_INFO_STRING MACOSX_BUNDLE_ICON_FILE
MACOSX_BUNDLE_GUI_IDENTIFIER
MACOSX_BUNDLE_LONG_VERSION_STRING MACOSX_BUNDLE_BUNDLE_NAME
MACOSX_BUNDLE_SHORT_VERSION_STRING
MACOSX_BUNDLE_BUNDLE_VERSION MACOSX_BUNDLE_COPYRIGHT</p>

<p>CMake variables of the same name may be set to affect
all tar- gets in a directory that do not have each specific
property set. If a custom Info.plist is specified by this
property it may of course hard-code all the settings instead
of using the target properties.</p>

<p>MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_INFO_PLIST Specify a custom Info.plist
template for a Mac OS X Framework.</p>

<p>An library target with FRAMEWORK enabled will be built
as a framework on Mac OS X. By default its Info.plist file
is cre- ated by configuring a template called
MacOSXFramework- Info.plist.in located in the
CMAKE_MODULE_PATH. This property specifies an alternative
template file name which may be a full path.</p>

<p>The following target properties may be set to specify
content to be configured into the file:</p>

<p>MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_ICON_FILE MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_IDENTIFIER
MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_SHORT_VERSION_STRING
MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_BUNDLE_VERSION</p>

<p>CMake variables of the same name may be set to affect
all tar- gets in a directory that do not have each specific
property set. If a custom Info.plist is specified by this
property it may of course hard-code all the settings instead
of using the target properties.</p>

<p>MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_&lt;CONFIG&gt; Map from project
configuration to IMPORTED target s configura- tion.</p>

<p>List configurations of an imported target that may be
used for the current project s &lt;CONFIG&gt; configuration.
Targets imported from another project may not provide the
same set of configura- tion names available in the current
project. Setting this prop- erty tells CMake what imported
configurations are suitable for use when building the
&lt;CONFIG&gt; configuration. The first config- uration in
the list found to be provided by the imported target is
selected. If no matching configurations are available the
imported target is considered to be not found. This property
is ignored for non-imported targets.</p>

<p>OUTPUT_NAME Sets the real name of a target when it is
built.</p>

<p>Sets the real name of a target when it is built and can
be used to help create two targets of the same name even
though CMake requires unique logical target names. There is
also a &lt;CON- FIG&gt;_OUTPUT_NAME that can set the output
name on a per-configu- ration basis.</p>

<p>POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT Deprecated install support.</p>

<p>The PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT and POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT
properties are the old way to specify CMake scripts to run
before and after installing a target. They are used only
when the old INSTALL_TARGETS command is used to install the
target. Use the INSTALL command instead.</p>

<p>PREFIX What comes before the library name.</p>

<p>A target property that can be set to override the prefix
(such as &quot;lib&quot;) on a library name.</p>

<p>PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT Deprecated install support.</p>

<p>The PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT and POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT
properties are the old way to specify CMake scripts to run
before and after installing a target. They are used only
when the old INSTALL_TARGETS command is used to install the
target. Use the INSTALL command instead.</p>

<p>PRIVATE_HEADER Specify private header files in a
FRAMEWORK shared library tar- get.</p>

<p>Shared library targets marked with the FRAMEWORK
property gener- ate frameworks on OS X and normal shared
libraries on other platforms. This property may be set to a
list of header files to be placed in the PrivateHeaders
directory inside the frame- work folder. On non-Apple
platforms these headers may be installed using the
PRIVATE_HEADER option to the install(TAR- GETS) command.</p>

<p>PROJECT_LABEL Change the name of a target in an IDE.</p>

<p>Can be used to change the name of the target in an IDE
like visual stuido.</p>

<p>PUBLIC_HEADER Specify public header files in a FRAMEWORK
shared library tar- get.</p>

<p>Shared library targets marked with the FRAMEWORK
property gener- ate frameworks on OS X and normal shared
libraries on other platforms. This property may be set to a
list of header files to be placed in the Headers directory
inside the framework folder. On non-Apple platforms these
headers may be installed using the PUBLIC_HEADER option to
the install(TARGETS) command.</p>

<p>RESOURCE Specify resource files in a FRAMEWORK shared
library target.</p>

<p>Shared library targets marked with the FRAMEWORK
property gener- ate frameworks on OS X and normal shared
libraries on other platforms. This property may be set to a
list of files to be placed in the Resources directory inside
the framework folder. On non-Apple platforms these files may
be installed using the RESOURCE option to the
install(TARGETS) command.</p>

<p>RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY Output directory in which to
build RUNTIME target files.</p>

<p>This property specifies the directory into which runtime
target files should be built. There are three kinds of
target files that may be built: archive, library, and
runtime. Executables are always treated as runtime targets.
Static libraries are always treated as archive targets.
Module libraries are always treated as library targets. For
non-DLL platforms shared libraries are treated as library
targets. For DLL platforms the DLL part of a shared library
is treated as a runtime target and the corresponding import
library is treated as an archive tar- get. All Windows-based
systems including Cygwin are DLL plat- forms. This property
is initialized by the value of the variable
CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY if it is set when a target is
created.</p>

<p>SKIP_BUILD_RPATH Should rpaths be used for the build
tree.</p>

<p>SKIP_BUILD_RPATH is a boolean specifying whether to skip
auto- matic generation of an rpath allowing the target to
run from the build tree. This property is initialized by the
value of the variable CMAKE_SKIP_BUILD_RPATH if it is set
when a target is created.</p>

<p>SOURCES Source names specified for a target.</p>

<p>Read-only list of sources specified for a target. The
names returned are suitable for passing to the
set_source_files_prop- erties command.</p>

<p>SOVERSION What version number is this target.</p>

<p>For shared libraries VERSION and SOVERSION can be used
to spec- ify the build version and api version respectively.
When build- ing or installing appropriate symlinks are
created if the plat- form supports symlinks and the linker
supports so-names. If only one of both is specified the
missing is assumed to have the same version number. For
shared libraries and executables on Windows the VERSION
attribute is parsed to extract a &quot;major.minor&quot;
ver- sion number. These numbers are used as the image
version of the binary.</p>

<p>STATIC_LIBRARY_FLAGS Extra flags to use when linking
static libraries.</p>

<p>Extra flags to use when linking a static library.</p>

<p>SUFFIX What comes after the library name.</p>

<p>A target property that can be set to override the suffix
(such as &quot;.so&quot;) on a library name.</p>

<p>TYPE The type of the target.</p>

<p>This read-only property can be used to test the type of
the given target. It will be one of STATIC_LIBRARY,
MODULE_LIBRARY, SHARED_LIBRARY, EXECUTABLE or one of the
internal target types.</p>

<p>VERSION What version number is this target.</p>

<p>For shared libraries VERSION and SOVERSION can be used
to spec- ify the build version and api version respectively.
When build- ing or installing appropriate symlinks are
created if the plat- form supports symlinks and the linker
supports so-names. If only one of both is specified the
missing is assumed to have the same version number. For
executables VERSION can be used to specify the build
version. When building or installing appropriate sym- links
are created if the platform supports symlinks. For shared
libraries and executables on Windows the VERSION attribute
is parsed to extract a &quot;major.minor&quot; version
number. These numbers are used as the image version of the
binary.</p>

<p>VS_KEYWORD Visual Studio project keyword.</p>

<p>Can be set to change the visual studio keyword, for
example QT integration works better if this is set to
Qt4VSv1.0.</p>

<p>VS_SCC_LOCALPATH Visual Studio Source Code Control
Provider.</p>

<p>Can be set to change the visual studio source code
control local path property.</p>

<p>VS_SCC_PROJECTNAME Visual Studio Source Code Control
Project.</p>

<p>Can be set to change the visual studio source code
control project name property.</p>

<p>VS_SCC_PROVIDER Visual Studio Source Code Control
Provider.</p>

<p>Can be set to change the visual studio source code
control provider property.</p>

<p>WIN32_EXECUTABLE Build an executable with a WinMain
entry point on windows.</p>

<p>When this property is set to true the executable when
linked on Windows will be created with a WinMain() entry
point instead of of just main().This makes it a GUI
executable instead of a con- sole application. See the
CMAKE_MFC_FLAG variable documentation to configure use of
MFC for WinMain executables.</p>

<p>XCODE_ATTRIBUTE_&lt;an-attribute&gt; Set Xcode target
attributes directly.</p>

<p>Tell the Xcode generator to set &lt;an-attribute&gt; to
a given value in the generated Xcode project. Ignored on
other genera- tors.</p>

<p>PROPERTIES ON TESTS FAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION If the
output matches this regular expression the test will
fail.</p>

<p>If set, if the output matches one of specified regular
expres- sions, the test will fail.For example:
PASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION
&quot;[^a-z]Error;ERROR;Failed&quot;</p>

<p>MEASUREMENT Specify a DART measurement and value to be
reported for a test.</p>

<p>If set to a name then that name will be reported to DART
as a named measurement with a value of 1. You may also
specify a value by setting MEASUREMENT to
&quot;measurement=value&quot;.</p>

<p>PASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION The output must match this
regular expression for the test to pass.</p>

<p>If set, the test output will be checked against the
specified regular expressions and at least one of the
regular expressions has to match, otherwise the test will
fail.</p>

<p>TIMEOUT How many seconds to allow for this test.</p>

<p>This property if set will limit a test to not take more
than the specified number of seconds to run. If it exceeds
that the test process will be killed and ctest will move to
the next test. This setting takes precedence over
DART_TESTING_TIMEOUT and CTEST_TESTING_TIMEOUT.</p>

<p>WILL_FAIL If set to true, this will invert the pass/fail
flag of the test.</p>

<p>This property can be used for tests that are expected to
fail and return a non zero return code.</p>

<p>PROPERTIES ON SOURCE FILES ABSTRACT Is this source file
an abstract class.</p>

<p>A property on a source file that indicates if the source
file represents a class that is abstract. This only makes
sense for languages that have a notion of an abstract class
and it is only used by some tools that wrap classes into
other languages.</p>

<p>COMPILE_DEFINITIONS Preprocessor definitions for
compiling a source file.</p>

<p>The COMPILE_DEFINITIONS property may be set to a list of
prepro- cessor definitions using the syntax VAR or
VAR=value. Func- tion-style definitions are not supported.
CMake will automati- cally escape the value correctly for
the native build system (note that CMake language syntax may
require escapes to specify some values). This property may
be set on a per-configuration basis using the name
COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_&lt;CONFIG&gt; where &lt;CONFIG&gt; is
an upper-case name (ex.
&quot;COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_DEBUG&quot;).</p>

<p>CMake will automatically drop some definitions that are
not sup- ported by the native build tool. The VS6 IDE does
not support definition values with spaces (but NMake does).
Xcode does not support per-configuration definitions on
source files.</p>

<p>Dislaimer: Most native build tools have poor support for
escaping certain values. CMake has work-arounds for many
cases but some values may just not be possible to pass
correctly. If a value does not seem to be escaped correctly,
do not attempt to work-around the problem by adding escape
sequences to the value. Your work-around may break in a
future version of CMake that has improved escape support.
Instead consider defining the macro in a (configured) header
file. Then report the limitation.</p>

<p>COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_&lt;CONFIG&gt; Per-configuration
preprocessor definitions on a source file.</p>

<p>This is the configuration-specific version of
COMPILE_DEFINI- TIONS. Note that Xcode does not support
per-configuration source file flags so this property will be
ignored by the Xcode generator.</p>

<p>COMPILE_FLAGS Additional flags to be added when
compiling this source file.</p>

<p>These flags will be added to the list of compile flags
when this source file builds. Use COMPILE_DEFINITIONS to
pass additional preprocessor definitions.</p>

<p>EXTERNAL_OBJECT If set to true then this is an object
file.</p>

<p>If this property is set to true then the source file is
really an object file and should not be compiled. It will
still be linked into the target though.</p>

<p>GENERATED Is this source file generated as part of the
build process.</p>

<p>If a source file is generated by the build process CMake
will handle it differently in temrs of dependency checking
etc. Oth- erwise having a non-existent source file could
create problems.</p>

<p>HEADER_FILE_ONLY Is this source file only a header
file.</p>

<p>A property on a source file that indicates if the source
file is a header file with no associated implementation.
This is set automatically based on the file extension and is
used by CMake to determine is certain dependency information
should be com- puted.</p>

<p>KEEP_EXTENSION Make the output file have the same
extension as the source file.</p>

<p>If this property is set then the file extension of the
output file will be the same as that of the source file.
Normally the output file extension is computed based on the
language of the source file, for example .cxx will go to a
.o extension.</p>

<p>LANGUAGE What programming language is the file.</p>

<p>A property that can be set to indicate what programming
language the source file is. If it is not set the language
is determined based on the file extension. Typical values
are CXX C etc.</p>

<p>LOCATION The full path to a source file.</p>

<p>A read only property on a SOURCE FILE that contains the
full path to the source file.</p>

<p>MACOSX_PACKAGE_LOCATION Place a source file inside a Mac
OS X bundle or framework.</p>

<p>Executable targets with the MACOSX_BUNDLE property set
are built as Mac OS X application bundles on Apple
platforms. Shared library targets with the FRAMEWORK
property set are built as Mac OS X frameworks on Apple
platforms. Source files listed in the target with this
property set will be copied to a directory inside the bundle
or framework content folder specified by the property value.
For bundles the content folder is
&quot;&lt;name&gt;.app/Contents&quot;. For frameworks the
content folder is
&quot;&lt;name&gt;.framework/Versions/&lt;version&gt;&quot;.
See the PUBLIC_HEADER, PRIVATE_HEADER, and RESOURCE target
properties for specifying files meant for Headers,
PrivateHeadres, or Resources directo- ries.</p>

<p>OBJECT_DEPENDS Additional files on which a compiled
object file depends.</p>

<p>Specifies a semicolon-separated list of full-paths to
files on which any object files compiled from this source
file depend. An object file will be recompiled if any of the
named files is newer than it.</p>

<p>This property need not be used to specify the dependency
of a source file on a generated header file that it
includes. Although the property was originally introduced
for this pur- pose, it is no longer necessary. If the
generated header file is created by a custom command in the
same target as the source file, the automatic dependency
scanning process will recognize the dependency. If the
generated header file is created by another target, an
inter-target dependency should be created with the
add_dependencies command (if one does not already exist due
to linking relationships).</p>

<p>OBJECT_OUTPUTS Additional outputs for a Makefile
rule.</p>

<p>Additional outputs created by compilation of this source
file. If any of these outputs is missing the object will be
recom- piled. This is supported only on Makefile generators
and will be ignored on other generators.</p>

<p>SYMBOLIC Is this just a name for a rule.</p>

<p>If SYMBOLIC (boolean) is set to true the build system
will be informed that the source file is not actually
created on disk but instead used as a symbolic name for a
build rule.</p>

<p>WRAP_EXCLUDE Exclude this source file from any code
wrapping techniques.</p>

<p>Some packages can wrap source files into alternate
languages to provide additional functionality. For example,
C++ code can be wrapped into Java or Python etc using SWIG
etc. If WRAP_EXCLUDE is set to true (1 etc) that indicates
then this source file should not be wrapped.</p>
