<p>NAME st - SCSI tape device</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/mtio.h&gt;</p>

<p>int ioctl(int fd, int request [, (void *)arg3]); int
ioctl(int fd, MTIOCTOP, (struct mtop *)mt_cmd); int
ioctl(int fd, MTIOCGET, (struct mtget *)mt_status); int
ioctl(int fd, MTIOCPOS, (struct mtpos *)mt_pos);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The st driver provides the interface to a
variety of SCSI tape devices. Currently, the driver takes
control of all detected devices of type sequential-access.
The st driver uses major device number 9.</p>

<p>Each device uses eight minor device numbers. The
lowermost five bits in the minor numbers are assigned
sequentially in the order of detec- tion. In the 2.6 kernel,
the bits above the eight lowermost bits are concatenated to
the five lowermost bits to form the tape number. The minor
numbers can be grouped into two sets of four numbers: the
princi- pal (auto-rewind) minor device numbers, n, and the
no-rewind device numbers, (n + 128). Devices opened using
the principal device number will be sent a REWIND command
when they are closed. Devices opened using the no-rewind
device number will not. (Note that using an auto-rewind
device for positioning the tape with, for instance, mt does
not lead to the desired result: the tape is rewound after
the mt com- mand and the next command starts from the
beginning of the tape).</p>

<p>Within each group, four minor numbers are available to
define devices with different characteristics (block size,
compression, density, etc.) When the system starts up, only
the first device is available. The other three are activated
when the default characteristics are defined (see below).
(By changing compile-time constants, it is possible to
change the balance between the maximum number of tape drives
and the number of minor numbers for each drive. The default
allocation allows control of 32 tape drives. For instance,
it is possible to control up to 64 tape drives with two
minor numbers for different options.)</p>

<p>Devices are typically created by:</p>

<p>mknod -m 666 /dev/st0 c 9 0 mknod -m 666 /dev/st0l c 9
32 mknod -m 666 /dev/st0m c 9 64 mknod -m 666 /dev/st0a c 9
96 mknod -m 666 /dev/nst0 c 9 128 mknod -m 666 /dev/nst0l c
9 160 mknod -m 666 /dev/nst0m c 9 192 mknod -m 666
/dev/nst0a c 9 224</p>

<p>There is no corresponding block device.</p>

<p>The driver uses an internal buffer that has to be large
enough to hold at least one tape block. In kernels before
2.1.121, the buffer is allocated as one contiguous block.
This limits the block size to the largest contiguous block
of memory the kernel allocator can provide. The limit is
currently 128 kB for 32-bit architectures and 256 kB for
64-bit architectures. In newer kernels the driver allocates
the buffer in several parts if necessary. By default, the
maximum number of parts is 16. This means that the maximum
block size is very large (2 MB if allocation of 16 blocks of
128 kB succeeds).</p>

<p>The drivers internal buffer size is determined by a
compile-time con- stant which can be overridden with a
kernel startup option. In addi- tion to this, the driver
tries to allocate a larger temporary buffer at run time if
necessary. However, run-time allocation of large contigu-
ous blocks of memory may fail and it is advisable not to
rely too much on dynamic buffer allocation with kernels
older than 2.1.121 (this applies also to demand-loading the
driver with kerneld or kmod).</p>

<p>The driver does not specifically support any tape drive
brand or model. After system start-up the tape device
options are defined by the drive firmware. For example, if
the drive firmware selects fixed-block mode, the tape device
uses fixed-block mode. The options can be changed with
explicit ioctl(2) calls and remain in effect when the device
is closed and reopened. Setting the options affects both the
auto-rewind and the non-rewind device.</p>

<p>Different options can be specified for the different
devices within the subgroup of four. The options take effect
when the device is opened. For example, the system
administrator can define one device that writes in
fixed-block mode with a certain block size, and one which
writes in variable-block mode (if the drive supports both
modes).</p>

<p>The driver supports tape partitions if they are
supported by the drive. (Note that the tape partitions have
nothing to do with disk partitions. A partitioned tape can
be seen as several logical tapes within one medium.)
Partition support has to be enabled with an ioctl(2). The
tape location is preserved within each partition across
partition changes. The partition used for subsequent tape
operations is selected with an ioctl(2). The partition
switch is executed together with the next tape operation in
order to avoid unnecessary tape movement. The maximum number
of partitions on a tape is defined by a compile-time
constant (originally four). The driver contains an ioctl(2)
that can format a tape with either one or two
partitions.</p>

<p>Device /dev/tape is usually created as a hard or soft
link to the default tape device on the system.</p>

<p>Starting from kernel 2.6.2, the driver exports in the
sysfs directory /sys/class/scsi_tape the attached devices
and some parameters assigned to the devices.</p>

<p>Data Transfer The driver supports operation in both
fixed-block mode and variable- block mode (if supported by
the drive). In fixed-block mode the drive writes blocks of
the specified size and the block size is not dependent on
the byte counts of the write system calls. In variable-block
mode one tape block is written for each write call and the
byte count deter- mines the size of the corresponding tape
block. Note that the blocks on the tape don t contain any
information about the writing mode: when reading, the only
important thing is to use commands that accept the block
sizes on the tape.</p>

<p>In variable-block mode the read byte count does not have
to match the tape block size exactly. If the byte count is
larger than the next block on tape, the driver returns the
data and the function returns the actual block size. If the
block size is larger than the byte count, the requested
amount of data from the start of the block is returned and
the rest of the block is discarded.</p>

<p>In fixed-block mode the read byte counts can be
arbitrary if buffering is enabled, or a multiple of the tape
block size if buffering is dis- abled. Kernels before
2.1.121 allow writes with arbitrary byte count if buffering
is enabled. In all other cases (kernel before 2.1.121 with
buffering disabled or newer kernel) the write byte count
must be a multiple of the tape block size.</p>

<p>In the 2.6 kernel, the driver tries to use direct
transfers between the user buffer and the device. If this is
not possible, the drivers internal buffer is used. The
reasons for not using direct transfers include improper
alignment of the user buffer (default is 512 bytes but this
can be changed by the HBA driver), one of more pages of the
user buffer not reachable by the SCSI adapter, etc.</p>

<p>A filemark is automatically written to tape if the last
tape operation before close was a write.</p>

<p>When a filemark is encountered while reading, the
following happens. If there are data remaining in the buffer
when the filemark is found, the buffered data is returned.
The next read returns zero bytes. The following read returns
data from the next file. The end of recorded data is
signaled by returning zero bytes for two consecutive read
calls. The third read returns an error.</p>

<p>Ioctls The driver supports three ioctl(2) requests.
Requests not recognized by the st driver are passed to the
SCSI driver. The definitions below are from
/usr/include/linux/mtio.h:</p>

<p>MTIOCTOP Perform a tape operation This request takes an
argument of type (struct mtop *). Not all drives support all
operations. The driver returns an EIO error if the drive
rejects an operation.</p>

<p>/* Structure for MTIOCTOP - mag tape op command: */
struct mtop { short mt_op; /* operations defined below */
int mt_count; /* how many of them */ };</p>

<p>Magnetic Tape operations for normal tape use:</p>

<p>MTBSF Backward space over mt_count filemarks.</p>

<p>MTBSFM Backward space over mt_count filemarks.
Reposition the tape to the EOT side of the last
filemark.</p>

<p>MTBSR Backward space over mt_count records (tape
blocks).</p>

<p>MTBSS Backward space over mt_count setmarks.</p>

<p>MTCOMPRESSION Enable compression of tape data within the
drive if mt_count is non-zero and disable compression if
mt_count is zero. This command uses the MODE page 15
supported by most DATs.</p>

<p>MTEOM Go to the end of the recorded media (for appending
files).</p>

<p>MTERASE Erase tape. With 2.6 kernel, short erase (mark
tape empty) is performed if the argument is zero. Otherwise
long erase (erase all) is done.</p>

<p>MTFSF Forward space over mt_count filemarks.</p>

<p>MTFSFM Forward space over mt_count filemarks. Reposition
the tape to the BOT side of the last filemark.</p>

<p>MTFSR Forward space over mt_count records (tape
blocks).</p>

<p>MTFSS Forward space over mt_count setmarks.</p>

<p>MTLOAD Execute the SCSI load command. A special case is
avail- able for some HP autoloaders. If mt_count is the
constant MT_ST_HPLOADER_OFFSET plus a number, the number is
sent to the drive to control the autoloader.</p>

<p>MTLOCK Lock the tape drive door.</p>

<p>MTMKPART Format the tape into one or two partitions. If
mt_count is non-zero, it gives the size of the first
partition and the second partition contains the rest of the
tape. If mt_count is zero, the tape is formatted into one
parti- tion. This command is not allowed for a drive unless
the partition support is enabled for the drive (see
MT_ST_CAN_PARTITIONS below).</p>

<p>MTNOP No op flushes the drivers buffer as a side effect.
Should be used before reading status with MTIOCGET.</p>

<p>MTOFFL Rewind and put the drive off line.</p>

<p>MTRESET Reset drive.</p>

<p>MTRETEN Re-tension tape.</p>

<p>MTREW Rewind.</p>

<p>MTSEEK Seek to the tape block number specified in
mt_count. This operation requires either a SCSI-2 drive that
sup- ports the LOCATE command (device-specific address) or a
Tandberg-compatible SCSI-1 drive (Tandberg, Archive Viper,
Wangtek, ...). The block number should be one that was
previously returned by MTIOCPOS if device-spe- cific
addresses are used.</p>

<p>MTSETBLK Set the drives block length to the value
specified in mt_count. A block length of zero sets the drive
to vari- able block size mode.</p>

<p>MTSETDENSITY Set the tape density to the code in
mt_count. The den- sity codes supported by a drive can be
found from the drive documentation.</p>

<p>MTSETPART The active partition is switched to mt_count.
The parti- tions are numbered from zero. This command is not
allowed for a drive unless the partition support is enabled
for the drive (see MT_ST_CAN_PARTITIONS below).</p>

<p>MTUNLOAD Execute the SCSI unload command (does not eject
the tape).</p>

<p>MTUNLOCK Unlock the tape drive door.</p>

<p>MTWEOF Write mt_count filemarks.</p>

<p>MTWSM Write mt_count setmarks.</p>

<p>Magnetic Tape operations for setting of device options
(by the supe- ruser):</p>

<p>MTSETDRVBUFFER Set various drive and driver options
according to bits encoded in mt_count. These consist of the
drive s buffering mode, a set of Boolean driver options, the
buffer write threshold, defaults for the block size and
density, and timeouts (only in kernels 2.1 and later). A
single operation can affect only one item in the list above
(the Booleans counted as one item.)</p>

<p>A value having zeros in the high-order 4 bits will be
used to set the drive s buffering mode. The buffering modes
are:</p>

<p>0 The drive will not report GOOD status on write
commands until the data blocks are actually written to the
medium.</p>

<p>1 The drive may report GOOD status on write commands as
soon as all the data has been transferred to the drives
internal buffer.</p>

<p>2 The drive may report GOOD status on write commands as
soon as (a) all the data has been transferred to the drive s
internal buffer, and (b) all buffered data from different
initiators has been successfully written to the medium.</p>

<p>To control the write threshold the value in mt_count
must include the constant MT_ST_WRITE_THRESHOLD logically
ORed with a block count in the low 28 bits. The block count
refers to 1024-byte blocks, not the physical block size on
the tape. The threshold cannot exceed the driver s internal
buffer size (see DESCRIPTION, above).</p>

<p>To set and clear the Boolean options the value in
mt_count must include one of the constants MT_ST_BOOLEANS,
MT_ST_SETBOOLEANS, MT_ST_CLEARBOOLEANS, or MT_ST_DEFBOOLEANS
logically ored with whatever combination of the following
options is desired. Using MT_ST_BOOLEANS the options can be
set to the values defined in the corresponding bits. With
MT_ST_SETBOOLEANS the options can be selectively set and
with MT_ST_DEFBOOLEANS selectively cleared.</p>

<p>The default options for a tape device are set with
MT_ST_DEF- BOOLEANS. A non-active tape device (e.g., device
with minor 32 or 160) is activated when the default options
for it are defined the first time. An activated device
inherits from the device activated at start-up the options
not set explicitly.</p>

<p>The Boolean options are:</p>

<p>MT_ST_BUFFER_WRITES (Default: true) Buffer all write
operations in fixed-block mode. If this option is false and
the drive uses a fixed block size, then all write operations
must be for a multiple of the block size. This option must
be set false to write reliable multi-volume archives.
MT_ST_ASYNC_WRITES (Default: true) When this option is true,
write operations return immediately without wait- ing for
the data to be transferred to the drive if the data fits
into the drivers buffer. The write threshold determines how
full the buffer must be before a new SCSI write command is
issued. Any errors reported by the drive will be held until
the next operation. This option must be set false to write
reliable multi-volume archives.</p>

<p>MT_ST_READ_AHEAD (Default: true) This option causes the
driver to provide read buffering and read-ahead in
fixed-block mode. If this option is false and the drive uses
a fixed block size, then all read operations must be for a
multiple of the block size.</p>

<p>MT_ST_TWO_FM (Default: false) This option modifies the
driver behavior when a file is closed. The normal action is
to write a single file- mark. If the option is true the
driver will write two filemarks and backspace over the
second one.</p>

<p>Note: This option should not be set true for QIC tape
drives since they are unable to overwrite a filemark. These
drives detect the end of recorded data by testing for blank
tape rather than two consecutive filemarks. Most other
current drives also detect the end of recorded data and
using two filemarks is usually neces- sary only when
interchanging tapes with some other sys- tems.</p>

<p>MT_ST_DEBUGGING (Default: false) This option turns on
various debugging messages from the driver (effective only
if the driver was compiled with DEBUG defined non-zero).</p>

<p>MT_ST_FAST_EOM (Default: false) This option causes the
MTEOM operation to be sent directly to the drive,
potentially speeding up the oper- ation but causing the
driver to lose track of the cur- rent file number normally
returned by the MTIOCGET request. If MT_ST_FAST_EOM is false
the driver will respond to an MTEOM request by forward
spacing over files.</p>

<p>MT_ST_AUTO_LOCK (Default: false) When this option is
true, the drive door is locked when the device is opened and
unlocked when it is closed.</p>

<p>MT_ST_DEF_WRITES (Default: false) The tape options
(block size, mode, compression, etc.) may change when
changing from one device linked to a drive to another device
linked to the same drive depend- ing on how the devices are
defined. This option defines when the changes are enforced
by the driver using SCSI- commands and when the drives
auto-detection capabilities are relied upon. If this option
is false, the driver sends the SCSI-commands immediately
when the device is changed. If the option is true, the
SCSI-commands are not sent until a write is requested. In
this case the drive firmware is allowed to detect the tape
structure when reading and the SCSI-commands are used only
to make sure that a tape is written according to the correct
specification.</p>

<p>MT_ST_CAN_BSR (Default: false) When read-ahead is used,
the tape must sometimes be spaced backward to the correct
position when the device is closed and the SCSI command to
space backwards over records is used for this purpose. Some
older drives cant process this command reliably and this
option can be used to instruct the driver not to use the
command. The end result is that, with read-ahead and
fixed-block mode, the tape may not be correctly positioned
within a file when the device is closed. With 2.6 kernel,
the default is true for drives supporting SCSI-3.</p>

<p>MT_ST_NO_BLKLIMS (Default: false) Some drives don t
accept the READ BLOCK LIMITS SCSI com- mand. If this is
used, the driver does not use the com- mand. The drawback is
that the driver cant check before sending commands if the
selected block size is acceptable to the drive.</p>

<p>MT_ST_CAN_PARTITIONS (Default: false) This option
enables support for several partitions within a tape. The
option applies to all devices linked to a drive.</p>

<p>MT_ST_SCSI2LOGICAL (Default: false) This option
instructs the driver to use the logical block addresses
defined in the SCSI-2 standard when per- forming the seek
and tell operations (both with MTSEEK and MTIOCPOS commands
and when changing tape partition). Otherwise the
device-specific addresses are used. It is highly advisable
to set this option if the drive sup- ports the logical
addresses because they count also filemarks. There are some
drives that only support the logical block addresses.</p>

<p>MT_ST_SYSV (Default: false) When this option is enabled,
the tape devices use the SystemV semantics. Otherwise the
BSD semantics are used. The most important difference
between the seman- tics is what happens when a device used
for reading is closed: in System V semantics the tape is
spaced forward past the next filemark if this has not
happened while using the device. In BSD semantics the tape
position is not changed.</p>

<p>MT_NO_WAIT (Default: false) Enables immediate mode
(i.e., dont wait for the command to finish) for some
commands (e.g., rewind).</p>

<p>An example:</p>

<p>struct mtop mt_cmd; mt_cmd.mt_op = MTSETDRVBUFFER;
mt_cmd.mt_count = MT_ST_BOOLEANS | MT_ST_BUFFER_WRITES |
MT_ST_ASYNC_WRITES; ioctl(fd, MTIOCTOP, mt_cmd);</p>

<p>The default block size for a device can be set with
MT_ST_DEF_BLKSIZE and the default density code can be set
with MT_ST_DEFDENSITY. The values for the parameters are
ored with the operation code.</p>

<p>With kernels 2.1.x and later, the timeout values can be
set with the subcommand MT_ST_SET_TIMEOUT ORed with the
timeout in seconds. The long timeout (used for rewinds and
other commands that may take a long time) can be set with
MT_ST_SET_LONG_TIME- OUT. The kernel defaults are very long
to make sure that a successful command is not timed out with
any drive. Because of this the driver may seem stuck even if
it is only waiting for the timeout. These commands can be
used to set more practical values for a specific drive. The
timeouts set for one device apply for all devices linked to
the same drive.</p>

<p>Starting from kernels 2.4.19 and 2.5.43, the driver
supports a status bit which indicates whether the drive
requests cleaning. The method used by the drive to return
cleaning information is set using the MT_ST_SEL_CLN
subcommand. If the value is zero, the cleaning bit is always
zero. If the value is one, the TapeAlert data defined in the
SCSI-3 standard is used (not yet implemented). Values 2-17
are reserved. If the lowest eight bits are &gt;= 18, bits
from the extended sense data are used. The bits 9-16 specify
a mask to select the bits to look at and the bits 17-23
specify the bit pattern to look for. If the bit pattern is
zero, one or more bits under the mask indicate the cleaning
request. If the pattern is non-zero, the pattern must match
the masked sense data byte.</p>

<p>MTIOCGET Get status This request takes an argument of
type (struct mtget *).</p>

<p>/* structure for MTIOCGET - mag tape get status command
*/ struct mtget { long mt_type; long mt_resid; /* the
following registers are device dependent */ long mt_dsreg;
long mt_gstat; long mt_erreg; /* The next two fields are not
always used */ daddr_t mt_fileno; daddr_t mt_blkno; };</p>

<p>mt_type The header file defines many values for mt_type,
but the current driver reports only the generic types
MT_ISSCSI1 (Generic SCSI-1 tape) and MT_ISSCSI2 (Generic
SCSI-2 tape).</p>

<p>mt_resid contains the current tape partition number.</p>

<p>mt_dsreg reports the drives current settings for block
size (in the low 24 bits) and density (in the high 8 bits).
These fields are defined by MT_ST_BLKSIZE_SHIFT,
MT_ST_BLKSIZE_MASK, MT_ST_DENSITY_SHIFT, and
MT_ST_DENSITY_MASK.</p>

<p>mt_gstat reports generic (device independent) status
information. The header file defines macros for testing
these status bits:</p>

<p>GMT_EOF(x): The tape is positioned just after a filemark
(always false after an MTSEEK operation).</p>

<p>GMT_BOT(x): The tape is positioned at the beginning of
the first file (always false after an MTSEEK operation).</p>

<p>GMT_EOT(x): A tape operation has reached the physical
End Of Tape.</p>

<p>GMT_SM(x): The tape is currently positioned at a setmark
(always false after an MTSEEK operation).</p>

<p>GMT_EOD(x): The tape is positioned at the end of
recorded data.</p>

<p>GMT_WR_PROT(x): The drive is write-protected. For some
drives this can also mean that the drive does not sup- port
writing on the current medium type.</p>

<p>GMT_ONLINE(x): The last open(2) found the drive with a
tape in place and ready for operation.</p>

<p>GMT_D_6250(x), GMT_D_1600(x), GMT_D_800(x): This generic
status information reports the current density setting for
9-track &frac12;&quot; tape drives only.</p>

<p>GMT_DR_OPEN(x): The drive does not have a tape in
place.</p>

<p>GMT_IM_REP_EN(x): Immediate report mode. This bit is set
if there are no guarantees that the data has been physi-
cally written to the tape when the write call returns. It is
set zero only when the driver does not buffer data and the
drive is set not to buffer data.</p>

<p>GMT_CLN(x): The drive has requested cleaning.
Implemented in kernels since 2.4.19 and 2.5.43.</p>

<p>mt_erreg The only field defined in mt_erreg is the
recovered error count in the low 16 bits (as defined by
MT_ST_SOFTERR_SHIFT and MT_ST_SOFTERR_MASK. Due to
inconsistencies in the way drives report recovered errors,
this count is often not maintained (most drives do not by
default report soft errors but this can be changed with a
SCSI MODE SELECT command).</p>

<p>mt_fileno reports the current file number (zero-based).
This value is set to -1 when the file number is unknown
(e.g., after MTBSS or MTSEEK).</p>

<p>mt_blkno reports the block number (zero-based) within
the current file. This value is set to -1 when the block
number is unknown (e.g., after MTBSF, MTBSS, or MTSEEK).</p>

<p>MTIOCPOS Get tape position This request takes an
argument of type (struct mtpos *) and reports the drive s
notion of the current tape block number, which is not the
same as mt_blkno returned by MTIOCGET. This drive must be a
SCSI-2 drive that supports the READ POSITION command
(device-specific address) or a Tandberg-compatible SCSI-1
drive (Tandberg, Archive Viper, Wangtek, ... ).</p>

<p>/* structure for MTIOCPOS - mag tape get position
command */ struct mtpos { long mt_blkno; /* current block
number */ };</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE EACCES An attempt was made to write or
erase a write-pro- tected tape. (This error is not detected
during open(2).)</p>

<p>EBUSY The device is already in use or the driver was
unable to allocate a buffer.</p>

<p>EFAULT The command parameters point to memory not
belong- ing to the calling process.</p>

<p>EINVAL An ioctl(2) had an invalid argument, or a
requested block size was invalid.</p>

<p>EIO The requested operation could not be completed.</p>

<p>ENOMEM The byte count in read(2) is smaller than the
next physical block on the tape. (Before 2.2.18 and
2.4.0-test6 the extra bytes have been silently ignored.)</p>

<p>ENOSPC A write operation could not be completed because
the tape reached end-of-medium.</p>

<p>ENOSYS Unknown ioctl(2).</p>

<p>ENXIO During opening, the tape device does not
exist.</p>

<p>EOVERFLOW An attempt was made to read or write a
variable- length block that is larger than the drivers
internal buffer.</p>

<p>EROFS Open is attempted with O_WRONLY or O_RDWR when the
tape in the drive is write-protected.</p>

<p>FILES /dev/st* the auto-rewind SCSI tape devices</p>

<p>/dev/nst* the non-rewind SCSI tape devices</p>

<p>NOTES 1. When exchanging data between systems, both
systems have to agree on the physical tape block size. The
parameters of a drive after startup are often not the ones
most operating systems use with these devices. Most systems
use drives in variable-block mode if the drive supports that
mode. This applies to most modern drives, including DATs,
8mm helical scan drives, DLTs, etc. It may be advisable to
use these drives in variable-block mode also in Linux (i.e.,
use MTSETBLK or MTSETDEFBLK at system startup to set the
mode), at least when exchanging data with a foreign system.
The drawback of this is that a fairly large tape block size
has to be used to get acceptable data transfer rates on the
SCSI bus.</p>

<p>2. Many programs (e.g., tar(1)) allow the user to
specify the blocking factor on the command line. Note that
this deter- mines the physical block size on tape only in
variable-block mode.</p>

<p>3. In order to use SCSI tape drives, the basic SCSI
driver, a SCSI-adapter driver and the SCSI tape driver must
be either configured into the kernel or loaded as modules.
If the SCSI-tape driver is not present, the drive is
recognized but the tape support described in this page is
not available.</p>

<p>4. The driver writes error messages to the console/log.
The SENSE codes written into some messages are automatically
translated to text if verbose SCSI messages are enabled in
kernel configuration.</p>

<p>5. The driver s internal buffering allows good
throughput in fixed-block mode also with small read(2) and
write(2) byte counts. With direct transfers this is not
possible and may cause a surprise when moving to the 2.6
kernel. The solu- tion is to tell the software to use larger
transfers (often telling it to use larger blocks). If this
is not possible, direct transfers can be disabled.</p>
