<p>NAME xconsole - monitor system console messages with
X</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS xconsole [-toolkitoption ...] [-file file-name]
[-notify] [-stripNon- print] [-daemon] [-verbose]
[-exitOnFail]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The xconsole program displays messages which
are usually sent to /dev/console.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Xconsole accepts all of the standard X Toolkit
command line options along with the additional options
listed below:</p>

<p>-file file-name To monitor some other device, use this
option to specify the device name. This does not work on
regular files as they are always ready to be read from.</p>

<p>-notify -nonotify When new data are received from the
console and the notify option is set, the icon name of the
application has &quot; *&quot; appended, so that it is
evident even when the application is iconified. -notify is
the default.</p>

<p>-daemon This option causes xconsole to place itself in
the background, using fork/exit.</p>

<p>-verbose When set, this option directs xconsole to
display an informa- tive message in the first line of the
text buffer.</p>

<p>-exitOnFail When set, this option directs xconsole to
exit when it is unable to redirect the console output.</p>

<p>-saveLines count When set, xconsole only preserves count
lines of message his- tory instead of growing the text
buffer without bound (a count of zero - the default - is
treated as placing no limit on the history).</p>

<p>X DEFAULTS This program uses the Athena Text widget,
look in the Athena Widget Set documentation for controlling
it.</p>

<p>Xconsole otherwise accepts resources of the same names
as the command- line options (without the leading dash).
&quot;file&quot; is a string type, &quot;saveLines&quot; an
integer, and the remaining options are booleans.</p>

<p>WIDGETS In order to specify resources, it is useful to
know the hierarchy of the widgets which compose xconsole. In
the notation below, indentation indicates hierarchical
structure. The widget class name is given first, followed by
the widget instance name.</p>

<p>XConsole xconsole XConsole text</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT DISPLAY to get the default host and display
number.</p>

<p>XENVIRONMENT to get the name of a resource file that
overrides the global resources stored in the
RESOURCE_MANAGER property.</p>

<p>FILES /usr/share/X11/app-defaults/XConsole specifies
required resources</p>
