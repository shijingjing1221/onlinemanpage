<p>XSetSelectionOwner(3) XLIB FUNCTIONS
XSetSelectionOwner(3)</p>

<p>NAME XSetSelectionOwner, XGetSelectionOwner,
XConvertSelection - manipulate window selection</p>

<p>SYNTAX int XSetSelectionOwner(Display *display, Atom
selection, Window owner, Time time);</p>

<p>Window XGetSelectionOwner(Display *display, Atom
selection);</p>

<p>int XConvertSelection(Display *display, Atom selection,
Atom target, Atom property, Window requestor, Time
time);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS display Specifies the connection to the X
server.</p>

<p>owner Specifies the owner of the specified selection
atom. You can pass a window or None.</p>

<p>property Specifies the property name. You also can pass
None.</p>

<p>requestor Specifies the requestor.</p>

<p>selection Specifies the selection atom.</p>

<p>target Specifies the target atom.</p>

<p>time Specifies the time. You can pass either a timestamp
or Cur- rentTime.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The XSetSelectionOwner function changes the
owner and last-change time for the specified selection and
has no effect if the specified time is earlier than the
current last-change time of the specified selection or is
later than the current X server time. Otherwise, the
last-change time is set to the specified time, with
CurrentTime replaced by the current server time. If the
owner window is specified as None, then the owner of the
selection becomes None (that is, no owner). Other- wise, the
owner of the selection becomes the client executing the
request.</p>

<p>If the new owner (whether a client or None) is not the
same as the cur- rent owner of the selection and the current
owner is not None, the cur- rent owner is sent a
SelectionClear event. If the client that is the owner of a
selection is later terminated (that is, its connection is
closed) or if the owner window it has specified in the
request is later destroyed, the owner of the selection
automatically reverts to None, but the last-change time is
not affected. The selection atom is unin- terpreted by the X
server. XGetSelectionOwner returns the owner win- dow, which
is reported in SelectionRequest and SelectionClear events.
Selections are global to the X server.</p>

<p>XSetSelectionOwner can generate BadAtom and BadWindow
errors.</p>

<p>The XGetSelectionOwner function returns the window ID
associated with the window that currently owns the specified
selection. If no selec- tion was specified, the function
returns the constant None. If None is returned, there is no
owner for the selection.</p>

<p>XGetSelectionOwner can generate a BadAtom error.</p>

<p>XConvertSelection requests that the specified selection
be converted to the specified target type:</p>

<p>&middot; If the specified selection has an owner, the X
server sends a SelectionRequest event to that owner.</p>

<p>&middot; If no owner for the specified selection exists,
the X server gen- erates a SelectionNotify event to the
requestor with property None.</p>

<p>The arguments are passed on unchanged in either of the
events. There are two predefined selection atoms: PRIMARY
and SECONDARY.</p>

<p>XConvertSelection can generate BadAtom and BadWindow
errors.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS BadAtom A value for an Atom argument does
not name a defined Atom.</p>

<p>BadWindow A value for a Window argument does not name a
defined Window.</p>
