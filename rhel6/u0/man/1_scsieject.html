<p>NAME scsieject - control SCSI tape devices</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS scsieject [-f &lt;scsi-generic-device&gt;]
commands</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The scsieject command controls SCSI devices
in a platform-independent manner. As long as mtx works on
the platform, so does scsieject.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The first argument, given following -f , is the
SCSI generic device corresponding to your tape drive.
Consult your operating systems doc- umentation for more
information (for example, under Linux these are generally
/dev/sg0 through /dev/sg15, under FreeBSD these are
/dev/pass0 through /dev/passX. Under Solaris this is usually
the same as your tape drive (Solaris has a SCSI passthrough
ioctl). You can set the STAPE or TAPE environment variable
rather than use -f.</p>

<p>COMMANDS load Load the medium into the drive. When this
command is issued to a CD/DVD drive and the tray is extended
the tray will be retracted if the drive is capable of
it.</p>

<p>unload Unload the medium from the drive (also known as
eject). When this command is issued to a CD/DVD drive or a
tape drive the media will be ejected if the device supports
it.</p>

<p>start Start the device. Some devices require a start
command after a media changer has loaded new media into the
device.</p>

<p>stop Stop the device. Some devices require a stop
command prior to unloading the medium from the device when
using a media changer.</p>

<p>lock Lock the device. Locks the device so that the
medium cannot be removed manually.</p>

<p>unlock Unlock the device. Unlocks the device so that the
medium can be removed manually.</p>

<p>AUTHORS This program was written by Robert Nelson
&lt;robertnelson@users.source- forge.net&gt; based on the
scsitape program written by Eric Lee Green
&lt;eric@badtux.org&gt;. Major portions of the mtxl.c
library used herein were written by Leonard Zubkoff.</p>

<p>HINTS Under Linux, cat /proc/scsi/scsi will tell you
what SCSI devices you have. You can then refer to them as
/dev/sga, /dev/sgb, etc. by the order they are reported.</p>

<p>Under FreeBSD, camcontrol devlist will tell you what
SCSI devices you have, along with which pass device controls
them.</p>

<p>Under Solaris 7 and 8, /usr/sbin/devfsadm -C will clean
up your /devices directory. Then find /devices
-namest@*-print will return a list of all tape drives. /dev
on Solaris is apparently only of his- torical interest.</p>

<p>BUGS AND LIMITATIONS There are no known bugs or
limitations.</p>

<p>AVAILABILITY This version of scsieject is currently
being maintained by Robert Nel- son
&lt;robertnelson@users.sourceforge.net&gt; as part of the
mtx suite of programs. The mtx home page is
http://mtx.sourceforge.net and the actual code is currently
available there and via SVN from
http://sourceforge.net/projects/mtx.</p>
