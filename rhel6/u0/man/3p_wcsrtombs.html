<p>WCSRTOMBS(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
WCSRTOMBS(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME wcsrtombs - convert a wide-character string to a
character string (restartable)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;wchar.h&gt;</p>

<p>size_t wcsrtombs(char *restrict dst, const wchar_t
**restrict src, size_t len, mbstate_t *restrict ps);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The wcsrtombs() function shall convert a
sequence of wide characters from the array indirectly
pointed to by src into a sequence of corre- sponding
characters, beginning in the conversion state described by
the object pointed to by ps. If dst is not a null pointer,
the converted characters shall then be stored into the array
pointed to by dst. Con- version continues up to and
including a terminating null wide charac- ter, which shall
also be stored. Conversion shall stop earlier in the
following cases:</p>

<p>* When a code is reached that does not correspond to a
valid character</p>

<p>* When the next character would exceed the limit of len
total bytes to be stored in the array pointed to by dst (and
dst is not a null pointer)</p>

<p>Each conversion shall take place as if by a call to the
wcrtomb() func- tion.</p>

<p>If dst is not a null pointer, the pointer object pointed
to by src shall be assigned either a null pointer (if
conversion stopped due to reaching a terminating null wide
character) or the address just past the last wide character
converted (if any). If conversion stopped due to reaching a
terminating null wide character, the resulting state
described shall be the initial conversion state.</p>

<p>If ps is a null pointer, the wcsrtombs() function shall
use its own internal mbstate_t object, which is initialized
at program start-up to the initial conversion state.
Otherwise, the mbstate_t object pointed to by ps shall be
used to completely describe the current conversion state of
the associated character sequence. The implementation shall
behave as if no function defined in this volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001 calls wcsrtombs().</p>

<p>If the application uses any of the
_POSIX_THREAD_SAFE_FUNCTIONS or _POSIX_THREADS functions,
the application shall ensure that the wcsr- tombs() function
is called with a non-NULL ps argument.</p>

<p>The behavior of this function shall be affected by the
LC_CTYPE cate- gory of the current locale.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE If conversion stops because a code is
reached that does not correspond to a valid character, an
encoding error occurs. In this case, the wcsrtombs()
function shall store the value of the macro [EILSEQ] in
errno and return (size_t)-1; the conversion state is
undefined. Other- wise, it shall return the number of bytes
in the resulting character sequence, not including the
terminating null (if any).</p>

<p>ERRORS The wcsrtombs() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL ps points to an object that contains an invalid
conversion state.</p>

<p>EILSEQ A wide-character code does not correspond to a
valid character.</p>
