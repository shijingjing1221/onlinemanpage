<p>NOTE This program is obsolete. Replacement for netstat
is ss. Replacement for netstat -r is ip route. Replacement
for netstat -i is ip -s link. Replacement for netstat -g is
ip maddr.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Netstat prints information about the Linux
networking subsystem. The type of information printed is
controlled by the first argument, as follows:</p>

<p>(none) By default, netstat displays a list of open
sockets. If you dont specify any address families, then the
active sockets of all configured address families will be
printed.</p>

<p>--route , -r Display the kernel routing tables.</p>

<p>--groups , -g Display multicast group membership
information for IPv4 and IPv6.</p>

<p>--interfaces=iface , -I=iface , -i Display a table of
all network interfaces, or the specified iface.</p>

<p>--masquerade , -M Display a list of masqueraded
connections.</p>

<p>--statistics , -s Display summary statistics for each
protocol.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --verbose , -v Tell the user what is going on by
being verbose. Especially print some useful information
about unconfigured address families.</p>

<p>--numeric , -n Show numerical addresses instead of
trying to determine symbolic host, port or user names.</p>

<p>--numeric-hosts shows numerical host addresses but does
not affect the resolution of port or user names.</p>

<p>--numeric-ports shows numerical port numbers but does
not affect the resolution of host or user names.</p>

<p>--numeric-users shows numerical user IDs but does not
affect the resolution of host or port names.</p>

<p>--protocol=family , -A Specifies the address families
(perhaps better described as low level protocols) for which
connections are to be shown. family is a comma (,) separated
list of address family keywords like inet, unix, ipx, ax25,
netrom, and ddp. This has the same effect as using the
--inet, --unix (-x), --ipx, --ax25, --netrom, and --ddp
options.</p>

<p>The address family inet includes raw, udp and tcp
protocol sockets.</p>

<p>-c, --continuous This will cause netstat to print the
selected information every second continuously.</p>

<p>-e, --extend Display additional information. Use this
option twice for maximum detail.</p>

<p>-o, --timers Include information related to networking
timers.</p>

<p>-p, --program Show the PID and name of the program to
which each socket belongs.</p>

<p>-l, --listening Show only listening sockets. (These are
omitted by default.)</p>

<p>-a, --all Show both listening and non-listening sockets.
With the --interfaces option, show interfaces that are not
marked</p>

<p>-F Print routing information from the FIB. (This is the
default.)</p>

<p>-C Print routing information from the route cache.</p>

<p>-Z --context If SELinux enabled print SELinux
context.</p>

<p>-T --notrim Stop trimming long addresses.</p>

<p>delay Netstat will cycle printing through statistics
every delay seconds. UP.</p>

<p>OUTPUT Active Internet connections (TCP, UDP, raw) Proto
The protocol (tcp, udp, raw) used by the socket.</p>

<p>Recv-Q The count of bytes not copied by the user program
connected to this socket.</p>

<p>Send-Q The count of bytes not acknowledged by the remote
host.</p>

<p>Local Address Address and port number of the local end
of the socket. Unless the --numeric (-n) option is
specified, the socket address is resolved to its canonical
host name (FQDN), and the port number is translated into the
corresponding service name.</p>

<p>Foreign Address Address and port number of the remote
end of the socket. Analogous to &quot;Local
Address.&quot;</p>

<p>State The state of the socket. Since there are no states
in raw mode and usu- ally no states used in UDP, this column
may be left blank. Normally this can be one of several
values:</p>

<p>ESTABLISHED The socket has an established
connection.</p>

<p>SYN_SENT The socket is actively attempting to establish
a connection.</p>

<p>SYN_RECV A connection request has been received from the
network.</p>

<p>FIN_WAIT1 The socket is closed, and the connection is
shutting down.</p>

<p>FIN_WAIT2 Connection is closed, and the socket is
waiting for a shutdown from the remote end.</p>

<p>TIME_WAIT The socket is waiting after close to handle
packets still in the network.</p>

<p>CLOSED The socket is not being used.</p>

<p>CLOSE_WAIT The remote end has shut down, waiting for the
socket to close.</p>

<p>LAST_ACK The remote end has shut down, and the socket is
closed. Waiting for acknowledgement.</p>

<p>LISTEN The socket is listening for incoming connections.
Such sockets are not included in the output unless you
specify the --listen- ing (-l) or --all (-a) option.</p>

<p>CLOSING Both sockets are shut down but we still dont
have all our data sent.</p>

<p>UNKNOWN The state of the socket is unknown.</p>

<p>User The username or the user id (UID) of the owner of
the socket.</p>

<p>PID/Program name Slash-separated pair of the process id
(PID) and process name of the process that owns the socket.
--program causes this column to be included. You will also
need superuser privileges to see this informa- tion on
sockets you don t own. This identification information is
not yet available for IPX sockets.</p>

<p>Timer (this needs to be written)</p>

<p>Active UNIX domain Sockets Proto The protocol (usually
unix) used by the socket.</p>

<p>RefCnt The reference count (i.e. attached processes via
this socket).</p>

<p>Flags The flags displayed is SO_ACCEPTON (displayed as
ACC), SO_WAITDATA (W) or SO_NOSPACE (N). SO_ACCECPTON is
used on unconnected sockets if their corresponding processes
are waiting for a connect request. The other flags are not
of normal interest.</p>

<p>Type There are several types of socket access:</p>

<p>SOCK_DGRAM The socket is used in Datagram
(connectionless) mode.</p>

<p>SOCK_STREAM This is a stream (connection) socket.</p>

<p>SOCK_RAW The socket is used as a raw socket.</p>

<p>SOCK_RDM This one serves reliably-delivered
messages.</p>

<p>SOCK_SEQPACKET This is a sequential packet socket.</p>

<p>SOCK_PACKET Raw interface access socket.</p>

<p>UNKNOWN Who ever knows what the future will bring us -
just fill in here :-)</p>

<p>State This field will contain one of the following
Keywords:</p>

<p>FREE The socket is not allocated</p>

<p>LISTENING The socket is listening for a connection
request. Such sockets are only included in the output if you
specify the --listening (-l) or --all (-a) option.</p>

<p>CONNECTING The socket is about to establish a
connection.</p>

<p>CONNECTED The socket is connected.</p>

<p>DISCONNECTING The socket is disconnecting.</p>

<p>(empty) The socket is not connected to another one.</p>

<p>UNKNOWN This state should never happen.</p>

<p>PID/Program name Process ID (PID) and process name of
the process that has the socket open. More info available in
Active Internet connections section writ- ten above.</p>

<p>Path This is the path name as which the corresponding
processes attached to the socket.</p>

<p>Active IPX sockets (this needs to be done by somebody
who knows it)</p>

<p>Active NET/ROM sockets (this needs to be done by
somebody who knows it)</p>

<p>Active AX.25 sockets (this needs to be done by somebody
who knows it)</p>

<p>NOTES Starting with Linux release 2.2 netstat -i does
not show interface statistics for alias interfaces. To get
per alias interface counters you need to setup explicit
rules using the ipchains(8) command.</p>

<p>BUGS Occasionally strange information may appear if a
socket changes as it is viewed. This is unlikely to
occur.</p>

<p>AUTHORS The netstat user interface was written by Fred
Baumgarten &lt;dc6iq@insu1.etec.uni-karlsruhe.de&gt; the man
page basically by Matt Welsh &lt;mdw@tc.cornell.edu&gt;. It
was updated by Alan Cox &lt;Alan.Cox@linux.org&gt; but could
do with a bit more work. It was updated again by Tuan Hoang
&lt;tqhoang@bigfoot.com&gt;. The man page and the command
included in the net-tools package is totally rewritten by
Bernd Eckenfels &lt;ecki@linux.de&gt;.</p>
