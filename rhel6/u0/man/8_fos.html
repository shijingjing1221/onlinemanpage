<p>NAME fos - failover services daemon to control the Red
Hat clustering ser- vices.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS fos [-c cfgfile|--configfile=cfgfile]
[-n|--nodaemon] [--nofork] [-t|--test-start] [-v|--verbose]
[-f|--monitor] [-F|--active] [-?|--help] [--usage]
[--version]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION fos reads the failover services section in
the cluster configuration file lvs.cf. The program must be
run with either &quot;--monitor&quot; or
&quot;--active&quot; (or -f and -F) specified. If
&quot;--monitor&quot; is used, the pro- gram starts nanny
daemons to monitor IP services on a partner system. If
&quot;--active&quot; is specified, the program starts the IP
services on the local system by executing startup scripts.
In both cases, a service failure or child daemon exiting
will cause fos to terminate, which in turn will notify pulse
that something failed and to initiate a cluster
failover.</p>

<p>fos is normally started by pulse although it can be run
as a command line tool. Similarly, the configuration file
that tells fos what to do is normally edited by piranha, but
it can be manually edited.</p>

<p>All activity from fos is logged to syslog (when fos is
running as a daemon).</p>

<p>OPTIONS -c cfgfile|--configfile=cfgfile Normally, fos
uses lvs.cf as its configuration file, but this can be
overridden and another file can be used.</p>

<p>-n|--nodaemon Normally, fos runs as a daemon, however
using this option, fos runs in the foreground. When running
in this mode, all its out- put is sent to STDOUT instead of
syslog.</p>

<p>--nofork Dont fork, but do perform disassociate.</p>

<p>-t|--test-start Running fos is test mode allows the user
to monitor what fos would actually do. This is only useful
during debugging.</p>

<p>-v|--verbose Display additional debugging information as
it runs.</p>

<p>-f|--monitor Start and control nanny daemons that will
monitor services (defined in the lvs.cf file) on a partner
computer system. Either this option, or
&quot;-F|--active&quot; must be specified.</p>

<p>-F|--active Start the IP services (defined in the lvs.cf
file) on the local system using scripts. Either this option
or &quot;-f|--monitor&quot; must be specified.</p>

<p>-?|--help Shows a verbose usage listing.</p>

<p>--usage Outputs a terse argument summary.</p>

<p>--version Print program version.</p>
