<p>NAME fence_ipmilan - Fence agent for IPMI over LAN</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION fence_ipmilan is an I/O Fencing agent which
can be used with machines controlled by IPMI. This agent
calls support software using ipmitool
(http://ipmitool.sf.net/).</p>

<p>fence_ipmilan accepts options on the command line as
well as from stdin. Fenced sends parameters through stdin
when it execs the agent. fence_ipmilan can be run by itself
with command line options. This is useful for testing and
for turning outlets on or off from scripts.</p>
