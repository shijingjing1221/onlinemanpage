<p>NAME mkfs - build a Linux file system</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS mkfs [-V] [-t fstype] [fs-options] filesys
[blocks]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION mkfs is used to build a Linux file system on
a device, usually a hard disk partition. filesys is either
the device name (e.g. /dev/hda1, /dev/sdb2), or a regular
file that shall contain the file system. blocks is the
number of blocks to be used for the file system.</p>

<p>The exit code returned by mkfs is 0 on success and 1 on
failure.</p>

<p>In actuality, mkfs is simply a front-end for the various
file system builders (mkfs.fstype) available under Linux.
The file system-specific builder is searched for in a number
of directories like perhaps /sbin, /sbin/fs, /sbin/fs.d,
/etc/fs, /etc (the precise list is defined at compile time
but at least contains /sbin and /sbin/fs), and finally in
the directories listed in the PATH environment variable.
Please see the file system-specific builder manual pages for
further details.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -V Produce verbose output, including all file
system-specific com- mands that are executed. Specifying
this option more than once inhibits execution of any file
system-specific commands. This is really only useful for
testing.</p>

<p>-t fstype Specifies the type of file system to be built.
If not speci- fied, the default file system type (currently
ext2) is used.</p>

<p>fs-options File system-specific options to be passed to
the real file sys- tem builder. Although not guaranteed, the
following options are supported by most file system
builders.</p>

<p>-c Check the device for bad blocks before building the
file system.</p>

<p>-l filename Read the bad blocks list from filename</p>

<p>-v Produce verbose output.</p>

<p>BUGS All generic options must precede and not be
combined with file system- specific options. Some file
system-specific programs do not support the -v (verbose)
option, nor return meaningful exit codes. Also, some file
system-specific programs do not automatically detect the
device size and require the blocks parameter to be
specified.</p>

from Remy Cards version for the ext2 file system.</p>
