<p>CONFIGURATION DETAILS Please refer to xorg.conf(5) for
general configuration details. This section only covers
configuration details specific to this driver.</p>

<p>The driver auto-detects all device information necessary
to initialize the card. However, if you have problems with
auto-detection, you can specify:</p>

<p>VideoRam - in kilobytes MemBase - physical address of
the linear framebuffer IOBase - physical address of the MMIO
registers ChipID - PCI DEVICE ID</p>

<p>In addition, the following driver Options are
supported:</p>

<p>Option &quot;SWcursor&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Selects
software cursor. The default is off.</p>

<p>Option &quot;NoAccel&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Enables
or disables all hardware acceleration. The default is to
enable hardware acceleration.</p>

<p>Option &quot;Dac6Bit&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Enables
or disables the use of 6 bits per color component when in 8
bpp mode (emulates VGA mode). By default, all 8 bits per
color component are used. The default is off.</p>

<p>Option &quot;VideoKey&quot; &quot;integer&quot; This
overrides the default pixel value for the YUV video overlay
key. The default value is 0x1E.</p>

<p>Option &quot;ScalerWidth&quot; &quot;integer&quot; This
sets the overlay scaler buffer width. Accepted values range
from 1024 to 2048, divisible by 64, values other than 1536
and 1920 may not make sense though. Should be set
automatically, but noone has a clue what the limit is for
which chip. If you think quality is not optimal when playing
back HD video (with horizon- tal resolution larger than this
setting), increase this value, if you get an empty area at
the right (usually pink), decrease it. Note this only
affects the &quot;true&quot; overlay via xv, it wont affect
things like textured video. The default value is either 1536
(for most chips) or 1920.</p>

<p>Option &quot;AGPMode&quot; &quot;integer&quot; Set AGP
data transfer rate. (used only when DRI is enabled) 1 -- 1x
(before AGP v3 only) 2 -- 2x (before AGP v3 only) 4 -- 4x 8
-- 8x (AGP v3 only) others -- invalid The default is to
leave it unchanged.</p>

<p>Option &quot;AGPFastWrite&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
Enable AGP fast writes. Enabling this is frequently the
cause of instability. Used only when the DRI is enabled. If
you enable this option you will get *NO* support from
developers. The default is off.</p>

<p>Option &quot;BusType&quot; &quot;string&quot; Used to
replace previous ForcePCIMode option. Should only be used
when drivers bus detection is incorrect or you want to force
a AGP card to PCI mode. Should NEVER force a PCI card to AGP
bus. PCI -- PCI bus AGP -- AGP bus PCIE -- PCI Express bus
(used only when DRI is enabled) The default is auto
detect.</p>

<p>Option &quot;DisplayPriority&quot; &quot;string&quot;
Used to prevent flickering or tearing problem caused by
display buffer underflow. AUTO -- Driver calculated
(default). BIOS -- Remain unchanged from BIOS setting. Use
this if the calculation is not correct for your card. HIGH
-- Force to the highest priority. Use this if you have
problem with above options. This may affect performance
slightly. The default value is AUTO.</p>

<p>Option &quot;ColorTiling&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Frame
buffer can be addressed either in linear or tiled mode.
Tiled mode can provide significant performance benefits with
3D applications, for 2D it shouldn t matter much. Tiling
will be disabled if the virtual x resolution exceeds 2048
(3968 for R300 and above), or if DRI is enabled the drm
module is too old. If this option is enabled, a new dri
driver is required for direct rendering too. Color tiling
will be automatically disabled in interlaced or doublescan
screen modes. The default value is on.</p>

<p>Option &quot;IgnoreEDID&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Do not
use EDID data for mode validation, but DDC is still used for
monitor detection. This is different from NoDDC option. The
default value is off.</p>

<p>Option &quot;CustomEDID&quot; &quot;string&quot; Forces
the X driver to use the EDID data specified in a file rather
than the displays EDID. Also overrides DDC monitor
detection. You may specify a semicolon separated list of
output name and filename pairs with an optional flag,
&quot;digital&quot; or &quot;analog&quot;, to override the
digital bit in the edid which is used by the driver to
determine whether to use the analog or digital encoder asso-
ciated with a DVI-I port. The output name is the randr
output name, e.g., &quot;VGA-0&quot; or &quot;DVI-0&quot;;
consult the Xorg log for the supported output names of any
given system. The file must contain a raw 128-byte EDID
block, as captured by get-edid. For example: Option
&quot;CustomEDID&quot; &quot;VGA-0:/tmp/edid1.bin;
DVI-0:/tmp/edid2.bin:digital&quot; will assign the EDID from
the file /tmp/edid1.bin to the output device VGA-0, and the
EDID from the file /tmp/edid2.bin to the output device DVI-0
and force the DVI port to use the digital encoder. Note that
a output name must always be specified, even if only one
EDID is specified. Caution: Specifying an EDID that doesn t
exactly match your dis- play may damage your hardware, as it
allows the driver to spec- ify timings beyond the
capabilities of your display. Use with care.</p>

<p>Option &quot;PanelSize&quot; &quot;string&quot; Should
only be used when driver cannot detect the correct panel
size. Apply to both desktop (TMDS) and laptop (LVDS) digital
panels. When a valid panel size is specified, the timings
col- lected from DDC and BIOS will not be used. If you have
a panel with timings different from that of a standard VESA
mode, you have to provide this information through the
Modeline. For example, Option &quot;PanelSize&quot;
&quot;1400x1050&quot; The default value is none.</p>

<p>Option &quot;EnablePageFlip&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
Enable page flipping for 3D acceleration. This will increase
performance but not work correctly in some rare cases, hence
the default is off. It is currently only supported on
R/RV/RS4xx and older hardware.</p>

<p>Option &quot;ForceMinDotClock&quot;
&quot;frequency&quot; Override minimum dot clock. Some
Radeon BIOSes report a minimum dot clock unsuitable (too
high) for use with television sets even when they actually
can produce lower dot clocks. If this is the case you can
override the value here. Note that using this option may
damage your hardware. You have been warned. The fre- quency
parameter may be specified as a float value with standard
suffixes like &quot;k&quot;, &quot;kHz&quot;, &quot;M&quot;,
&quot;MHz&quot;.</p>

<p>Option &quot;RenderAccel&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
Enables or disables hardware Render acceleration. It is sup-
ported on all Radeon cards when using EXA acceleration and
on Radeon R/RV/RS1xx, R/RV/RS2xx and RS3xx when usig XAA.
The default is to enable Render acceleration.</p>

<p>Option &quot;AccelMethod&quot; &quot;string&quot;
Chooses between available acceleration architectures. Valid
options are XAA and EXA. XAA is the traditional acceleration
architecture and support for it is very stable. EXA is a
newer acceleration architecture with better performance for
the Render and Composite extensions. The default is EXA.</p>

<p>Option &quot;AccelDFS&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Use or
don t use accelerated EXA DownloadFromScreen hook when
possible (only when Direct Rendering is enabled, e.g.).
Default: off with AGP due to issues with GPU-&gt;host
transfers with some AGP bridges, on otherwise.</p>

<p>Option &quot;FBTexPercent&quot; &quot;integer&quot;
Amount of video RAM to reserve for OpenGL textures, in
percent. With EXA, the remainder of video RAM is reserved
for EXA off- screen management. Specifying 0 results in all
offscreen video RAM being reserved for EXA and only GART
memory being available for OpenGL textures. This may improve
EXA performance, but beware that it may cause problems with
OpenGL drivers from Mesa versions older than 6.4. With XAA,
specifying lower percentage than what gets reserved without
this option has no effect, but the driver tries to increase
the video RAM reserved for textures to the amount specified
roughly. Default: 50.</p>

<p>Option &quot;DepthBits&quot; &quot;integer&quot;
Precision in bits per pixel of the shared depth buffer used
for 3D acceleration. Valid values are 16 and 24. When this
is 24, there will also be a hardware accelerated stencil
buffer, but the combined depth/stencil buffer will take up
twice as much video RAM as when its 16. Default: The same as
the screen depth.</p>

<p>Option &quot;DMAForXv&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Try or
dont try to use DMA for Xv image transfers. This will reduce
CPU usage when playing big videos like DVDs, but may cause
instabilities. Default: on.</p>

<p>Option &quot;SubPixelOrder&quot; &quot;string&quot;
Force subpixel order to specified order. Subpixel order is
used for subpixel decimation on flat panels. NONE -- No
subpixel (CRT like displays) RGB -- in horizontal RGB order
(most flat panels) BGR -- in horizontal BGR order (some flat
panels)</p>

<p>This option is intended to be used in following cases:
1. The default subpixel order is incorrect for your panel.
2. Enable subpixel decimation on analog panels. 3. Adjust to
one display type in dual-head clone mode setup. 4. Get
better performance with Render acceleration on digital
panels (use NONE setting). The default is NONE for CRT, RGB
for digital panels</p>

<p>Option &quot;ClockGating&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
Enable dynamic clock gating. This can help reduce heat and
increase battery life by reducing power usage. Some users
report reduced 3D performance with this enabled. The default
is off.</p>

<p>Option &quot;ForceLowPowerMode&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
Enable a static low power mode. This can help reduce heat
and increase battery life by reducing power usage at the
expense of performance. The default is off.</p>

<p>Option &quot;DynamicPM&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Enable
dynamic power mode switching. This can help reduce heat and
increase battery life by reducing power usage when the sys-
tem is idle (DPMS active). The default is off.</p>

<p>Option &quot;VGAAccess&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Tell
the driver if it can do legacy VGA IOs to the card. This is
necessary for properly resuming consoles when in VGA text
mode, but shouldn t be if the console is using radeonfb or
some other graphic mode driver. Some platforms like PowerPC
have issues with those, and they arent necessary unless you
have a real text mode in console. The default is off on
PowerPC and SPARC and on on other architectures.</p>

<p>Option &quot;ReverseDDC&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; When
BIOS connector informations aren t available, use this
option to reverse the mapping of the 2 main DDC ports. Use
this if the X server obviously detects the wrong display for
each connector. This is typically needed on the Radeon 9600
cards bundled with Apple G5s. The default is off.</p>

<p>Option &quot;LVDSProbePLL&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; When
BIOS panel informations arent available (like on Power-
Books), it may still be necessary to use the firmware
provided PLL values for the panel or flickering will happen.
This option will force probing of the current value
programmed in the chip when X is launched in that case. This
is only useful for LVDS panels (laptop internal panels). The
default is on.</p>

<p>Option &quot;TVDACLoadDetect&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
Enable load detection on the TV DAC. The TV DAC is used to
drive both TV-out and analog monitors. Load detection is
often unreliable in the TV DAC so it is disabled by default.
The default is off.</p>

<p>Option &quot;DefaultTMDSPLL&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
Use the default driver provided TMDS PLL values rather than
the ones provided by the bios. This option has no effect on
Mac cards. Enable this option if you are having problems
with a DVI monitor using the internal TMDS controller. The
default is off.</p>

<p>Option &quot;DefaultTVDACAdj&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
Use the default driver provided TVDAC Adj values rather than
the ones provided by the bios. This option has no effect on
Mac cards. Enable this option if you are having problems
with a washed out display on the secondary DAC. The default
is off.</p>

<p>Option &quot;DRI&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Enable DRI
support. This option allows you to enable to disable the
DRI. The default is off for RN50/ES1000 and on for
others.</p>

<p>Option &quot;DefaultConnectorTable&quot;
&quot;boolean&quot; Enable this option to skip the BIOS
connector table parsing and use the driver defaults for each
chip. The default is off</p>

<p>Option &quot;MacModel&quot; &quot;string&quot; Used to
specify Mac models for connector tables and quirks. If you
have a powerbook or mini with DVI that does not work prop-
erly, try the alternate options as Apple does not seem to
pro- vide a good way of knowing whether they use internal or
external TMDS for DVI. Only valid on PowerPC. On Linux, the
driver will attempt to detect the MacModel automatically.
ibook -- ibooks powerbook-external -- Powerbooks with
external DVI powerbook-internal -- Powerbooks with
integrated DVI powerbook-vga -- Powerbooks with VGA rather
than DVI mini-external -- Mac Mini with external DVI
mini-internal -- Mac Mini with integrated DVI imac-g5-isight
-- iMac G5 iSight emac -- eMac G4 The default value is
undefined.</p>

<p>Option &quot;TVStandard&quot; &quot;string&quot; Used to
specify the default TV standard if you want to use some-
thing other than the bios default. Valid options are: ntsc
pal pal-m pal-60 ntsc-j scart-pal The default value is
undefined.</p>

<p>Option &quot;ForceTVOut&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Enable
this option to force TV-out to always be detected as
attached. The default is off</p>

<p>Option &quot;IgnoreLidStatus&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
Enable this option to ignore lid status on laptops and
always detect LVDS as attached. The default is on.</p>

<p>Option &quot;Int10&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; This option
allows you to disable int10 initialization. Set this to
False if you are experiencing a hang when initializing a
secondary card. The default is on.</p>

<p>Option &quot;EXAVSync&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; This
option attempts to avoid tearing by stalling the engine
until the display controller has passed the destination
region. It reduces tearing at the cost of performance and
has been know to cause instability on some chips. The
default is off.</p>

<p>Option &quot;ATOMTvOut&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; This
option enables experimental TV-out support for R/RV5xx,
R/RV6xx, and R/RV7xx atombios chips. TV-out is experimental
and may not function on these chips as well as hoped for.
The default is off.</p>

<p>Option &quot;R4xxATOM&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; This
option enables modesetting on R/RV4xx chips using atombios.
The default is off.</p>

<p>Option &quot;EXAPixmaps&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; (KMS
Only) Under kernel modesetting to avoid thrashing pixmaps
in/out of VRAM on low memory cards, we use a heuristic based
on VRAM amount, to determine whether to allow EXA to use
VRAM for non-essential pixmaps. This option allows us to
override the heurisitc. The default is on with &gt; 32MB
VRAM, off with &lt; 32MB.</p>

<p>Option &quot;ZaphodHeads&quot; &quot;string&quot;
Specify the randr output(s) to use with zaphod mode for a
par- ticular driver instance. If you use this option you
most use this option for all instances of the driver. For
example: Option &quot;ZaphodHeads&quot;
&quot;LVDS,VGA-0&quot; will assign xrandr outputs LVDS and
VGA-0 to this instance of the driver.</p>

<p>TEXTURED VIDEO ATTRIBUTES The driver supports the
following X11 Xv attributes for Textured Video. You can use
the &quot;xvattr&quot; tool to query/set those attributes at
runtime.</p>

<p>XV_VSYNC XV_VSYNC is used to control whether textured
adapter synchro- nizes the screen update to the monitor
vertical refresh to elim- inate tearing. It has two values:
off(0) and on (1). The default iso(1).</p>

<p>XV_CRTC XV_CRTC is used to control which display
controller (crtc) the textured adapter synchronizes the
screen update with when XV_VSYNC is enabled. The default,
auto(-1), will sync to the display controller that more of
the video is on. This attribute is useful for things like
clone mode where the user can best decide which display
should be synced. The default is aut(-1).</p>

<p>XV_BICUBIC XV_BICUBIC is used to control whether
textured adapter should apply a bicubic filter to smooth the
output. It has three val- ues: off(0), on(1) and auto(2).
off means never apply the filter, on means always apply the
filter and auto means apply the filter only if the X and Y
sizes are scaled to more than double to avoid blurred
output. Bicubic filtering is not currently compatible with
other Xv attributes like hue, con- trast, and brightness,
and must be disabled to use those attributes. The default
isaut(2).</p>
