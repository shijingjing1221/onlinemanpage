<p>SMARTD.CONF(5) 2010-01-28 SMARTD.CONF(5)</p>

<p>NAME smartd.conf - SMART Disk Monitoring Daemon
Configuration File</p>

<p>FULL PATH /etc/smartd.conf</p>

<p>PACKAGE VERSION smartmontools-5.39.1 released 2010-01-28
at 20:48:28</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION /etc/smartd.conf is the configuration file
for the smartd daemon, which monitors the Self-Monitoring,
Analysis and Reporting Technology (SMART) system built into
many ATA-3 and later ATA, IDE and SCSI-3 hard drives.</p>

<p>If the configuration file /etc/smartd.conf is present,
smartd reads it at startup, before fork(2)ing into the
background. If smartd subse- quently receives a HUP signal,
it will then re-read the configuration file. If smartd is
running in debug mode, then an INT signal will also make it
re-read the configuration file. This signal can be generated
by typing &lt;CONTROL-C&gt; in the terminal window where
smartd is running.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION FILE /etc/smartd.conf In the absence of a
configuration file, under Linux smartd will try to open the
20 ATA devices /dev/hd[a-t] and the 26 SCSI devices
/dev/sd[a- z]. Under FreeBSD, smartd will try to open all
existing ATA devices (with entries in /dev) /dev/ad[0-9]+
and all existing SCSI devices (using CAM subsystem). Under
NetBSD/OpenBSD, smartd will try to open all existing ATA
devices (with entries in /dev) /dev/wd[0-9]+c and all
existing SCSI devices /dev/sd[0-9]+c. Under Solaris smartd
will try to open all entries &quot;/dev/rdsk/c?t?d?s?&quot;
for IDE/ATA and SCSI disk devices, and entries
&quot;/dev/rmt/*&quot; for SCSI tape devices. Under Windows
smartd will try to open all entries &quot;/dev/hd[a-j]&quot;
(&quot;\.Physi- calDrive[0-9]&quot;) for IDE/ATA devices on
WinNT4/2000/XP, &quot;/dev/hd[a-d]&quot; (bitmask from
&quot;\.RTVSD&quot;) for IDE/ATA devices on
Win95/98/98SE/ME, and &quot;/dev/scsi[0-9][0-7]&quot; (ASPI
adapter 0-9, ID 0-7) for SCSI devices on all versions of
Windows. Under Darwin, smartd will open any ATA block
storage device.</p>

<p>This can be annoying if you have an ATA or SCSI device
that hangs or misbehaves when receiving SMART commands. Even
if this causes no prob- lems, you may be annoyed by the
string of error log messages about block-major devices that
can&acute;t be found, and SCSI devices that can&acute;t be
opened.</p>

<p>One can avoid this problem, and gain more control over
the types of events monitored by smartd, by using the
configuration file /etc/smartd.conf. This file contains a
list of devices to monitor, with one device per line. An
example file is included with the smart- montools
distribution. You will find this sample configuration file
in /usr/share/doc/smartmontools-5.39.1/. For security, the
configuration file should not be writable by anyone but
root. The syntax of the file is as follows:</p>

<p>&middot; There should be one device listed per line,
although you may have lines that are entirely comments or
white space.</p>

<p>&middot; Any text following a hash sign &acute;#&acute;
and up to the end of the line is taken to be a comment, and
ignored.</p>

<p>&middot; Lines may be continued by using a backslash
&acute;&acute; as the last non- whitespace or non-comment
item on a line.</p>

<p>&middot; Note: a line whose first character is a hash
sign &acute;#&acute; is treated as a white-space blank line,
not as a non-existent line, and will end a continuation
line.</p>

<p>Here is an example configuration file. It&acute;s for
illustrative purposes only; please don&acute;t copy it onto
your system without reading to the end of the DIRECTIVES
Section below!</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION FILE DIRECTIVES If the first non-comment
entry in the configuration file is the text string
DEVICESCAN in capital letters, then smartd will ignore any
remaining lines in the configuration file, and will scan for
devices. DEVICESCAN may optionally be followed by Directives
that will apply to all devices that are found in the scan.
Please see below for addi- tional details.</p>

<p>The following are the Directives that may appear
following the device name or DEVICESCAN on any line of the
/etc/smartd.conf configuration file. Note that these are NOT
command-line options for smartd. The Directives below may
appear in any order, following the device name.</p>

<p>For an ATA device, if no Directives appear, then the
device will be monitored as if the &acute;-a&acute;
Directive (monitor all SMART properties) had been given.</p>

<p>If a SCSI disk is listed, it will be monitored at the
maximum imple- mented level: roughly equivalent to using the
&acute;-H -l selftest&acute; options for an ATA disk. So
with the exception of &acute;-d&acute;, &acute;-m&acute;,
&acute;-l selftest&acute;, &acute;-s&acute;, and
&acute;-M&acute;, the Directives below are ignored for SCSI
disks. For SCSI disks, the &acute;-m&acute; Directive sends
a warning email if the SMART sta- tus indicates a disk
failure or problem, if the SCSI inquiry about disk status
fails, or if new errors appear in the self-test log.</p>

<p>If a 3ware controller is used then the corresponding
SCSI (/dev/sd?) or character device (/dev/twe? or /dev/twa?)
must be listed, along with the &acute;-d 3ware,N&acute;
Directive (see below). The individual ATA disks hosted by
the 3ware controller appear to smartd as normal ATA devices.
Hence all the ATA directives can be used for these disks
(but see note below).</p>

<p>If an Areca controller is used then the corresponding
SCSI generic device (/dev/sg?) must be listed, along with
the &acute;-d areca,N&acute; Direc- tive (see below). The
individual SATA disks hosted by the Areca con- troller
appear to smartd as normal ATA devices. Hence all the ATA
directives can be used for these disks. Areca firmware
version 1.46 or later which supports smartmontools must be
used; Please see the smartctl(8) man page for further
details.</p>

<p>-d TYPE Specifies the type of the device. This Directive
may be used multiple times for one device, but the arguments
ata, scsi, sat, marvell, cciss,N, areca,N, megaraid,N and
3ware,N are mutually- exclusive. If more than one is given
then smartd will use the last one which appears.</p>

<p>If none of these three arguments is given, then smartd
will first attempt to guess the device type by looking at
whether the sixth character in the device name is an
&acute;s&acute; or an &acute;h&acute;. This will work for
device names like /dev/hda or /dev/sdb, and corre- sponds to
choosing ata or scsi respectively. If smartd can&acute;t
guess from this sixth character, then it will simply try to
access the device using first ATA and then SCSI
ioctl()s.</p>

<p>The valid arguments to this Directive are:</p>

<p>ata - the device type is ATA. This prevents smartd from
issuing SCSI commands to an ATA device.</p>

<p>scsi - the device type is SCSI. This prevents smartd
from issu- ing ATA commands to a SCSI device.</p>

<p>sat - the device type is SCSI to ATA Translation (SAT).
smartd will generate ATA (smart) commands and then package
them in the SAT defined ATA PASS THROUGH SCSI commands. The
commands are then routed through the SCSI pass through
interface to the oper- ating system. There are two types of
ATA PASS THROUGH SCSI com- mands: a 12 byte and 16 byte
variant. smartd can use either and defaults to the 16 byte
variant. This can be overridden with this syntax: &acute;-d
sat,12&acute; or &acute;-d sat,16&acute;.</p>

<p>marvell - Under Linux, interact with SATA disks behind
Marvell chip-set controllers (using the Marvell rather than
libata driver).</p>

<p>megaraid,N - the device consists of one or more
SCSI/SAS/SATA disks connected to a MegaRAID controller. The
non-negative integer N (in the range of 0 to 127 inclusive)
denotes which disk on the controller is monitored. In log
files and email messages this disk will be identified as
megaraid_disk_XXX with XXX in the range from 000 to 127
inclusive.</p>

<p>3ware,N - the device consists of one or more ATA disks
connected to a 3ware RAID controller. The non-negative
integer N (in the range from 0 to 127 inclusive) denotes
which disk on the con- troller is monitored. In log files
and email messages this disk will be identified as
3ware_disk_XXX with XXX in the range from 000 to 127
inclusive.</p>

<p>This Directive may at first appear confusing, because
the 3ware controller is a SCSI device (such as /dev/sda) and
should be listed as such in the the configuration file.
However when the &acute;-d 3ware,N&acute; Directive is used,
then the corresponding disk is addressed using native ATA
commands which are &acute;passed through&acute; the SCSI
driver. All ATA Directives listed in this man page may be
used. Note that while you may use any of the 3ware SCSI log-
ical devices /dev/sd? to address any of the physical disks
(3ware ports), error and log messages will make the most
sense if you always list the 3ware SCSI logical device
corresponding to the particular physical disks. Please see
the smartctl(8) man page for further details.</p>

<p>ATA disks behind 3ware controllers may alternatively be
accessed via a character device interface /dev/twe0-15
(3ware 6000/7000/8000 controllers) and /dev/twa0-15 (3ware
9000 series controllers). Note that the 9000 series
controllers may only be accessed using the character device
interface /dev/twa0-15 and not the SCSI device interface
/dev/sd?. Please see the smartctl(8) man page for further
details.</p>

<p>Note that older 3w-xxxx drivers do not pass the
&acute;Enable Autosave&acute; (-S on) and &acute;Enable
Automatic Offline&acute; (-o on) com- mands to the disk, if
the SCSI interface is used, and produce these types of
harmless syslog error messages instead: &acute;3w-xxxx:
tw_ioctl(): Passthru size (123392) too big&acute;. This can
be fixed by upgrading to version 1.02.00.037 or later of the
3w-xxxx driver, or by applying a patch to older versions.
See http://smartmontools.sourceforge.net/ for instructions.
Alter- natively use the character device interfaces
/dev/twe0-15 (3ware 6/7/8000 series controllers) or
/dev/twa0-15 (3ware 9000 series controllers).</p>

<p>areca,N - the device consists of one or more SATA disks
con- nected to an Areca SATA RAID controller. The positive
integer N (in the range from 1 to 24 inclusive) denotes
which disk on the controller is monitored. In log files and
email messages this disk will be identifed as areca_disk_XX
with XX in the range from 01 to 24 inclusive.</p>

<p>cciss,N - the device consists of one or more SCSI disks
con- nected to a cciss RAID controller. The non-negative
integer N (in the range from 0 to 15 inclusive) denotes
which disk on the controller is monitored. In log files and
email messages this disk will be identified as cciss_disk_XX
with XX in the range from 00 to 15 inclusive.</p>

<p>3ware, MegaRAID, Areca and cciss controllers are
currently ONLY supported under Linux.</p>

<p>hpt,L/M/N - the device consists of one or more ATA disks
con- nected to a HighPoint RocketRAID controller. The
integer L is the controller id, the integer M is the channel
number, and the integer N is the PMPort number if it is
available. The allowed values of L are from 1 to 4
inclusive, M are from 1 to 8 inclu- sive and N from 1 to 4
if PMPort available. And also these val- ues are limited by
the model of the HighPoint RocketRAID controller. In log
files and email messages this disk will be identified as
hpt_X/X/X and X/X/X is the same as L/M/N, note if no N
indicated, N set to the default value 1.</p>

<p>HighPoint RocketRAID controllers are currently ONLY
supported under Linux and FreeBSD.</p>

<p>removable - the device or its media is removable. This
indi- cates to smartd that it should continue (instead of
exiting, which is the default behavior) if the device does
not appear to be present when smartd is started. This
Directive may be used in conjunction with the other
&acute;-d&acute; Directives.</p>

<p>-n POWERMODE[,N][,q] This &acute;nocheck&acute;
Directive is used to prevent a disk from being spun-up when
it is periodically polled by smartd.</p>

<p>ATA disks have five different power states. In order of
increas- ing power consumption they are: &acute;OFF&acute;,
&acute;SLEEP&acute;, &acute;STANDBY&acute;,
&acute;IDLE&acute;, and &acute;ACTIVE&acute;. Typically in
the OFF, SLEEP, and STANDBY modes the disk&acute;s platters
are not spinning. But usually, in response to SMART commands
issued by smartd, the disk platters are spun up. So if this
option is not used, then a disk which is in a low-power mode
may be spun up and put into a higher-power mode when it is
periodically polled by smartd.</p>

<p>Note that if the disk is in SLEEP mode when smartd is
started, then it wont respond to smartd commands, and so the
disk wont be registered as a device for smartd to monitor.
If a disk is in any other low-power mode, then the commands
issued by smartd to register the disk will probably cause it
to spin-up.</p>

<p>The &acute;-n&acute; (nocheck) Directive specifies if
smartd&acute;s periodic checks should still be carried out
when the device is in a low-power mode. It may be used to
prevent a disk from being spun-up by periodic smartd
polling. The allowed values of POW- ERMODE are:</p>

<p>never - smartd will poll (check) the device regardless
of its power mode. This may cause a disk which is spun-down
to be spun-up when smartd checks it. This is the default
behavior if the -n Directive is not given.</p>

<p>sleep - check the device unless it is in SLEEP mode.</p>

<p>standby - check the device unless it is in SLEEP or
STANDBY mode. In these modes most disks are not spinning, so
if you want to prevent a laptop disk from spinning up each
time that smartd polls, this is probably what you want.</p>

<p>idle - check the device unless it is in SLEEP, STANDBY
or IDLE mode. In the IDLE state, most disks are still
spinning, so this is probably not what you want.</p>

<p>Maximum number of skipped checks (in a row) can be
specified by appending positive number &acute;,N&acute; to
POWERMODE (like &acute;-n standby,15&acute;). After N checks
are skipped in a row, powermode is ignored and the check is
performed anyway.</p>

<p>When a periodic test is skipped, smartd normally writes
an informal log message. The message can be suppressed by
appending the option &acute;,q&acute; to POWERMODE (like
&acute;-n standby,q&acute;). This pre- vents a laptop disk
from spinning up due to this message.</p>

<p>Both &acute;,N&acute; and &acute;,q&acute; can be
specified together.</p>

<p>-T TYPE Specifies how tolerant smartd should be of SMART
command fail- ures. The valid arguments to this Directive
are:</p>

<p>normal - do not try to monitor the disk if a mandatory
SMART command fails, but continue if an optional SMART
command fails. This is the default.</p>

<p>permissive - try to monitor the disk even if it appears
to lack SMART capabilities. This may be required for some
old disks (prior to ATA-3 revision 4) that implemented SMART
before the SMART standards were incorporated into the
ATA/ATAPI Specifica- tions. This may also be needed for some
Maxtor disks which fail to comply with the ATA
Specifications and don t properly indi- cate support for
error- or self-test logging.</p>

<p>[Please see the smartctl -T command-line option.]</p>

<p>-o VALUE Enables or disables SMART Automatic Offline
Testing when smartd starts up and has no further effect. The
valid arguments to this Directive are on and off.</p>

<p>The delay between tests is vendor-specific, but is
typically four hours.</p>

<p>Note that SMART Automatic Offline Testing is not part of
the ATA Specification. Please see the smartctl -o
command-line option documentation for further information
about this feature.</p>

<p>-S VALUE Enables or disables Attribute Autosave when
smartd starts up and has no further effect. The valid
arguments to this Directive are on and off. Also affects
SCSI devices. [Please see the smartctl -S command-line
option.]</p>

<p>-H Check the SMART health status of the disk. If any
Prefailure Attributes are less than or equal to their
threshold values, then disk failure is predicted in less
than 24 hours, and a mes- sage at loglevel
&acute;LOG_CRITICAL&acute; will be logged to syslog. [Please
see the smartctl -H command-line option.]</p>

<p>-l TYPE Reports increases in the number of errors in one
of the two SMART logs. The valid arguments to this Directive
are:</p>

<p>error - report if the number of ATA errors reported in
the ATA Error Log has increased since the last check.</p>

<p>selftest - report if the number of failed tests reported
in the SMART Self-Test Log has increased since the last
check, or if the timestamp associated with the most recent
failed test has increased. Note that such errors will only
be logged if you run self-tests on the disk (and it fails a
test!). Self-Tests can be run automatically by smartd:
please see the &acute;-s&acute; Directive below. Self-Tests
can also be run manually by using the &acute;-t short&acute;
and &acute;-t long&acute; options of smartctl and the
results of the testing can be observed using the smartctl
&acute;-l selftest&acute; command-line option.]</p>

<p>[Please see the smartctl -l and -t command-line
options.]</p>

<p>-s REGEXP Run Self-Tests or Offline Immediate Tests, at
scheduled times. A Self- or Offline Immediate Test will be
run at the end of periodic device polling, if all 12
characters of the string T/MM/DD/d/HH match the extended
regular expression REGEXP. Here:</p>

<p>T is the type of the test. The values that smartd will
try to match (in turn) are: &acute;L&acute; for a Long
Self-Test, &acute;S&acute; for a Short Self-Test,
&acute;C&acute; for a Conveyance Self-Test (ATA only), and
&acute;O&acute; for an Offline Immediate Test (ATA only). As
soon as a match is found, the test will be started and no
addi- tional matches will be sought for that device and that
polling cycle.</p>

<p>[NEW EXPERIMENTAL SMARTD FEATURE] To run scheduled
Selective Self-Tests, use &acute;n&acute; for next span,
&acute;r&acute; to redo last span, or &acute;c&acute; to
continue with next span or redo last span based on status of
last test. The LBA range is based on the first span from the
last test. See the smartctl -t select,[next|redo|cont]
options for further info.</p>

<p>MM is the month of the year, expressed with two decimal
digits. The range is from 01 (January) to 12 (December)
inclusive. Do not use a single decimal digit or the match
will always fail!</p>

<p>DD is the day of the month, expressed with two decimal
digits. The range is from 01 to 31 inclusive. Do not use a
single decimal digit or the match will always fail!</p>

<p>d is the day of the week, expressed with one decimal
digit. The range is from 1 (Monday) to 7 (Sunday)
inclusive.</p>

<p>HH is the hour of the day, written with two decimal
digits, and given in hours after midnight. The range is 00
(midnight to just before 1am) to 23 (11pm to just before
midnight) inclu- sive. Do not use a single decimal digit or
the match will always fail!</p>

<p>Some examples follow. In reading these, keep in mind
that in extended regular expressions a dot &acute;.&acute;
matches any single char- acter, and a parenthetical
expression such as &acute;(A|B|C)&acute; denotes any one of
the three possibilities A, B, or C.</p>

<p>To schedule a short Self-Test between 2-3am every
morning, use: -s S/../.././02 To schedule a long Self-Test
between 4-5am every Sunday morning, use: -s L/../../7/04 To
schedule a long Self-Test between 10-11pm on the first and
fifteenth day of each month, use: -s L/../(01|15)/./22 To
schedule an Offline Immediate test after every midnight,
6am, noon,and 6pm, plus a Short Self-Test daily at 1-2am and
a Long Self-Test every Saturday at 3-4am, use: -s
(O/../.././(00|06|12|18)|S/../.././01|L/../../6/03) If Long
Self-Tests of a large disks take longer than the system
uptime, a full disk test can be performed by several
Selective Self-Tests. To setup a full test of a 1TB disk
within 20 days (one 50GB span each day), run this command
once: smartctl -t select,0-99999999 /dev/sda To run the next
test spans on Monday-Friday between 12-13am, run smartd with
this directive: -s n/../../[1-5]/12</p>

<p>Scheduled tests are run immediately following the
regularly- scheduled device polling, if the current local
date, time, and test type, match REGEXP. By default the
regularly-scheduled device polling occurs every thirty
minutes after starting smartd. Take caution if you use the
&acute;-i&acute; option to make this polling interval more
than sixty minutes: the poll times may fail to coincide with
any of the testing times that you have specified with
REGEXP. In this case the test will be run fol- lowing the
next device polling.</p>

<p>Before running an offline or self-test, smartd checks to
be sure that a self-test is not already running. If a
self-test is already running, then this running self test
will not be inter- rupted to begin another test.</p>

<p>smartd will not attempt to run any type of test if
another test was already started or run in the same
hour.</p>

<p>To avoid performance problems during system boot, smartd
will not attempt to run any scheduled tests following the
very first device polling (unless &acute;-q onecheck&acute;
is specified).</p>

<p>Each time a test is run, smartd will log an entry to
SYSLOG. You can use these or the -q showtests command-line
option to verify that you constructed REGEXP correctly. The
matching order (L before S before C before O) ensures that
if multiple test types are all scheduled for the same hour,
the longer test type has precedence. This is usually the
desired behavior.</p>

<p>If the scheduled tests are used in conjunction with
state per- sistence (&acute;-s&acute; option), smartd will
also try to match the hours since last shutdown (or 90 days
at most). If any test would have been started during
downtime, the longest (see above) of these tests is run
after second device polling.</p>

<p>If the &acute;-n&acute; directive is used and any test
would have been started during disk standby time, the
longest of these tests is run when the disk is active
again.</p>

<p>Unix users: please beware that the rules for extended
regular expressions [regex(7)] are not the same as the rules
for file-name pattern matching by the shell [glob(7)].
smartd will issue harmless informational warning messages if
it detects characters in REGEXP that appear to indicate that
you have made this mistake.</p>

<p>-m ADD Send a warning email to the email address ADD if
the &acute;-H&acute;, &acute;-l&acute;, &acute;-f&acute;,
&acute;-C&acute;, or &acute;-O&acute; Directives detect a
failure or a new error, or if a SMART command to the disk
fails. This Directive only works in conjunction with these
other Directives (or with the equivalent default
&acute;-a&acute; Directive).</p>

<p>To prevent your email in-box from getting filled up with
warning messages, by default only a single warning will be
sent for each of the enabled alert types, &acute;-H&acute;,
&acute;-l&acute;, &acute;-f&acute;, &acute;-C&acute;, or
&acute;-O&acute; even if more than one failure or error is
detected or if the failure or error persists. [This behavior
can be modified; see the &acute;-M&acute; Directive
below.]</p>

<p>To send email to more than one user, please use the
following &quot;comma separated&quot; form for the address:
user1@add1,user2@add2,...,userN@addN (with no spaces).</p>

<p>To test that email is being sent correctly, use the
&acute;-M test&acute; Directive described below to send one
test email message on smartd startup.</p>

<p>By default, email is sent using the system mail command.
In order that smartd find the mail command (normally
/bin/mail) an executable named &acute;mail&acute; must be in
the path of the shell or environment from which smartd was
started. If you wish to spec- ify an explicit path to the
mail executable (for example /usr/local/bin/mail) or a
custom script to run, please use the &acute;-M exec&acute;
Directive below.</p>

<p>Note that by default under Solaris, in the previous
paragraph, &acute;mailx&acute; and &acute;/bin/mailx&acute;
are used, since Solaris &acute;/bin/mail&acute; does not
accept a &acute;-s&acute; (Subject) command-line
argument.</p>

<p>On Windows, the &acute;Blat&acute; mailer
(http://blat.sourceforge.net/) is used by default. This
mailer uses a different command line syn- tax, see &acute;-M
exec&acute; below.</p>

<p>Note also that there is a special argument
&lt;nomailer&gt; which can be given to the &acute;-m&acute;
Directive in conjunction with the &acute;-M exec&acute;
Directive. Please see below for an explanation of its
effect.</p>

<p>If the mailer or the shell running it produces any
STDERR/STDOUT output, then a snippet of that output will be
copied to SYSLOG. The remainder of the output is discarded.
If problems are encountered in sending mail, this should
help you to understand and fix them. If you have mail
problems, we recommend running smartd in debug mode with the
&acute;-d&acute; flag, using the &acute;-M test&acute;
Directive described below.</p>

<p>The following extension is available on Windows: By
specifying &acute;msgbox&acute; as a mail address, a warning
&quot;email&quot; is displayed as a message box on the
screen. Using both &acute;msgbox&acute; and regular mail
addresses is possible, if &acute;msgbox&acute; is the first
word in the comma separated list. With
&acute;sysmsgbox&acute;, a system modal (always on top)
message box is used. If running as a service, a service
notification message box (always shown on current visible
desk- top) is used.</p>

<p>-M TYPE These Directives modify the behavior of the
smartd email warn- ings enabled with the &acute;-m&acute;
email Directive described above. These &acute;-M&acute;
Directives only work in conjunction with the
&acute;-m&acute; Directive and can not be used without
it.</p>

<p>Multiple -M Directives may be given. If more than one of
the following three -M Directives are given (example: -M
once -M daily) then the final one (in the example, -M daily)
is used.</p>

<p>The valid arguments to the -M Directive are (one of the
follow- ing three):</p>

<p>once - send only one warning email for each type of disk
problem detected. This is the default.</p>

<p>daily - send additional warning reminder emails, once
per day, for each type of disk problem detected.</p>

<p>diminishing - send additional warning reminder emails,
after a one-day interval, then a two-day interval, then a
four-day interval, and so on for each type of disk problem
detected. Each interval is twice as long as the previous
interval.</p>

<p>In addition, one may add zero or more of the following
Direc- tives:</p>

<p>test - send a single test email immediately upon smartd
startup. This allows one to verify that email is delivered
correctly. Note that if this Directive is used, smartd will
also send the normal email warnings that were enabled with
the &acute;-m&acute; Directive, in addition to the single
test email!</p>

<p>exec PATH - run the executable PATH instead of the
default mail command, when smartd needs to send email. PATH
must point to an executable binary file or script.</p>

<p>By setting PATH to point to a customized script, you can
make smartd perform useful tricks when a disk problem is
detected (beeping the console, shutting down the machine,
broadcasting warnings to all logged-in users, etc.) But
please be careful. smartd will block until the executable
PATH returns, so if your executable hangs, then smartd will
also hang. Some sample scripts are included in
/usr/share/doc/smartmon- tools-5.39.1/examplescripts/.</p>

<p>The return status of the executable is recorded by
smartd in SYSLOG. The executable is not expected to write to
STDOUT or STDERR. If it does, then this is interpreted as
indicating that something is going wrong with your
executable, and a fragment of this output is logged to
SYSLOG to help you to understand the problem. Normally, if
you wish to leave some record behind, the executable should
send mail or write to a file or device.</p>

<p>Before running the executable, smartd sets a number of
environ- ment variables. These environment variables may be
used to con- trol the executable&acute;s behavior. The
environment variables exported by smartd are:</p>

<p>SMARTD_MAILER is set to the argument of -M exec, if
present or else to &acute;mail&acute; (examples: /bin/mail,
mail).</p>

<p>SMARTD_DEVICE is set to the device path (examples:
/dev/hda, /dev/sdb).</p>

<p>SMARTD_DEVICETYPE is set to the device type (possible
values: ata, scsi, 3ware,N, areca,N, hpt,L/M/N). Here
N=0,...,127 denotes the ATA disk behind a 3ware RAID
controller and L/M/N denotes the SATA disk behind a
HighPoint RocketRAID controller.</p>

<p>SMARTD_DEVICESTRING is set to the device description.
For SMARTD_DEVICETYPE of ata or scsi, this is the same as
SMARTD_DEVICE. For 3ware RAID controllers, the form used is
&acute;/dev/sdc [3ware_disk_01]&acute;. For HighPoint
RocketRAID controller, the form is &acute;/dev/sdd
[hpt_1/1/1]&acute; under Linux or &acute;/dev/hptrr
[hpt_1/1/1]&acute; under FreeBSD. For Areca controllers, the
form is &acute;/dev/sg2 [areca_disk_09]&acute;. In these
cases the device string contains a space and is NOT quoted.
So to use $SMARTD_DEVICESTRING in a bash script you should
probably enclose it in double quotes.</p>

<p>SMARTD_FAILTYPE gives the reason for the warning or
message email. The pos- sible values that it takes and their
meanings are: EmailTest: this is an email test message.
Health: the SMART health status indicates imminent failure.
Usage: a usage Attribute has failed. SelfTest: the number of
self-test failures has increased. ErrorCount: the number of
errors in the ATA error log has increased.
CurrentPendingSector: one of more disk sectors could not be
read and are marked to be reallocated (replaced with spare
sectors). OfflineUncorrectableSector: during off-line
testing, or self-testing, one or more disk sectors could not
be read. FailedHealthCheck: the SMART health status command
failed. FailedReadSmartData: the command to read SMART
Attribute data failed. FailedReadSmartErrorLog: the command
to read the SMART error log failed.
FailedReadSmartSelfTestLog: the command to read the SMART
self-test log failed. FailedOpenDevice: the open() command
to the device failed.</p>

<p>SMARTD_ADDRESS is determined by the address argument ADD
of the &acute;-m&acute; Direc- tive. If ADD is
&lt;nomailer&gt;, then SMARTD_ADDRESS is not set. Otherwise,
it is set to the comma-separated-list of email addresses
given by the argument ADD, with the commas replaced by
spaces (example:admin@example.com root). If more than one
email address is given, then this string will contain space
characters and is NOT quoted, so to use it in a bash script
you may want to enclose it in double quotes.</p>

<p>SMARTD_MESSAGE is set to the one sentence summary
warning email message string from smartd. This message
string contains space characters and is NOT quoted. So to
use $SMARTD_MESSAGE in a bash script you should probably
enclose it in double quotes.</p>

<p>SMARTD_FULLMESSAGE is set to the contents of the entire
email warning message string from smartd. This message
string contains space and return characters and is NOT
quoted. So to use $SMARTD_FULLMESSAGE in a bash script you
should probably enclose it in double quotes.</p>

<p>SMARTD_TFIRST is a text string giving the time and date
at which the first problem of this type was reported. This
text string contains space characters and no newlines, and
is NOT quoted. For example: Sun Feb 9 14:58:19 2003 CST</p>

<p>SMARTD_TFIRSTEPOCH is an integer, which is the unix
epoch (number of seconds since Jan 1, 1970) for
SMARTD_TFIRST.</p>

<p>The shell which is used to run PATH is system-dependent.
For vanilla Linux/glibc it&acute;s bash. For other systems,
the man page for popen(3) should say what shell is used.</p>

<p>If the &acute;-m ADD&acute; Directive is given with a
normal address argu- ment, then the executable pointed to by
PATH will be run in a shell with STDIN receiving the body of
the email message, and with the same command-line arguments:
-s &quot;$SMARTD_SUBJECT&quot; $SMARTD_ADDRESS that would
normally be provided to &acute;mail&acute;. Examples
include: -m user@home -M exec /bin/mail -m admin@work -M
exec /usr/local/bin/mailto -m root -M exec
/Example_1/bash/script/below</p>

<p>Note that on Windows, the syntax of the
&acute;Blat&acute; mailer is used: - -q -subject
&quot;$SMARTD_SUBJECT&quot; -to
&quot;$SMARTD_ADDRESS&quot;</p>

<p>If the &acute;-m ADD&acute; Directive is given with the
special address argument &lt;nomailer&gt; then the
executable pointed to by PATH is run in a shell with no
STDIN and no command-line arguments, for example: -m
&lt;nomailer&gt; -M exec /Example_2/bash/script/below If the
executable produces any STDERR/STDOUT output, then smartd
assumes that something is going wrong, and a snippet of that
output will be copied to SYSLOG. The remainder of the output
is then discarded.</p>

<p>Some EXAMPLES of scripts that can be used with the
&acute;-M exec&acute; Directive are given below. Some sample
scripts are also included in
/usr/share/doc/smartmontools-5.39.1/examplescripts/.</p>

<p>-f Check for &acute;failure&acute; of any Usage
Attributes. If these Attributes are less than or equal to
the threshold, it does NOT indicate imminent disk failure.
It &quot;indicates an advisory con- dition where the usage
or age of the device has exceeded its intended design life
period.&quot; [Please see the smartctl -A com- mand-line
option.]</p>

<p>-p Report anytime that a Prefail Attribute has changed
its value since the last check, 30 minutes ago. [Please see
the smartctl -A command-line option.]</p>

<p>-u Report anytime that a Usage Attribute has changed its
value since the last check, 30 minutes ago. [Please see the
smartctl -A command-line option.]</p>

<p>-t Equivalent to turning on the two previous flags
&acute;-p&acute; and &acute;-u&acute;. Tracks changes in all
device Attributes (both Prefailure and Usage). [Please see
the smartctl -A command-line option.]</p>

<p>-i ID Ignore device Attribute number ID when checking
for failure of Usage Attributes. ID must be a decimal
integer in the range from 1 to 255. This Directive modifies
the behavior of the &acute;-f&acute; Directive and has no
effect without it.</p>

<p>This is useful, for example, if you have a very old disk
and don&acute;t want to keep getting messages about the
hours-on-lifetime Attribute (usually Attribute 9) failing.
This Directive may appear multiple times for a single
device, if you want to ignore multiple Attributes.</p>

<p>-I ID Ignore device Attribute ID when tracking changes
in the Attribute values. ID must be a decimal integer in the
range from 1 to 255. This Directive modifies the behavior of
the &acute;-p&acute;, &acute;-u&acute;, and &acute;-t&acute;
tracking Directives and has no effect with- out one of
them.</p>

<p>This is useful, for example, if one of the device
Attributes is the disk temperature (usually Attribute 194 or
231). It&acute;s annoy- ing to get reports each time the
temperature changes. This Directive may appear multiple
times for a single device, if you want to ignore multiple
Attributes.</p>

<p>-r ID[!] When tracking, report the Raw value of
Attribute ID along with its (normally reported) Normalized
value. ID must be a decimal integer in the range from 1 to
255. This Directive modifies the behavior of the
&acute;-p&acute;, &acute;-u&acute;, and &acute;-t&acute;
tracking Directives and has no effect without one of them.
This Directive may be given mul- tiple times.</p>

<p>A common use of this Directive is to track the device
Tempera- ture (often ID=194 or 231).</p>

<p>If the optional flag &acute;!&acute; is appended, a
change of the Normalized value is considered critical. The
report will be logged as LOG_CRIT and a warning email will
be sent if &acute;-m&acute; is specified.</p>

<p>-R ID[!] When tracking, report whenever the Raw value of
Attribute ID changes. (Normally smartd only tracks/reports
changes of the Normalized Attribute values.) ID must be a
decimal integer in the range from 1 to 255. This Directive
modifies the behavior of the &acute;-p&acute;,
&acute;-u&acute;, and &acute;-t&acute; tracking Directives
and has no effect without one of them. This Directive may be
given multi- ple times.</p>

<p>If this Directive is given, it automatically implies the
&acute;-r&acute; Directive for the same Attribute, so that
the Raw value of the Attribute is reported.</p>

<p>A common use of this Directive is to track the device
Tempera- ture (often ID=194 or 231). It is also useful for
understanding how different types of system behavior affects
the values of certain Attributes.</p>

<p>If the optional flag &acute;!&acute; is appended, a
change of the Raw value is considered critical. The report
will be logged as LOG_CRIT and a warning email will be sent
if &acute;-m&acute; is specified. An exam- ple is &acute;-R
5!&acute; to warn when new sectors are reallocated.</p>

<p>-C ID[+] [ATA only] Report if the current number of
pending sectors is non-zero. Here ID is the id number of the
Attribute whose raw value is the Current Pending Sector
count. The allowed range of ID is 0 to 255 inclusive. To
turn off this reporting, use ID = 0. If the -C ID option is
not given, then it defaults to -C 197 (since Attribute 197
is generally used to monitor pending sectors).</p>

<p>If &acute;+&acute; is specified, a report is only
printed if the number of sectors has increased between two
check cycles. Some disks do not reset this attribute when a
bad sector is reallocated. See also &acute;-v
197,increasing&acute; below.</p>

<p>A pending sector is a disk sector (containing 512 bytes
of your data) which the device would like to mark as
bad&quot; and reallo- cate. Typically this is because your
computer tried to read that sector, and the read failed
because the data on it has been corrupted and has
inconsistent Error Checking and Correction (ECC) codes. This
is important to know, because it means that there is some
unreadable data on the disk. The problem of fig- uring out
what file this data belongs to is operating system and file
system specific. You can typically force the sector to
reallocate by writing to it (translation: make the device
sub- stitute a spare good sector for the bad one) but at the
price of losing the 512 bytes of data stored there.</p>

<p>-U ID[+] [ATA only] Report if the number of offline
uncorrectable sectors is non-zero. Here ID is the id number
of the Attribute whose raw value is the Offline
Uncorrectable Sector count. The allowed range of ID is 0 to
255 inclusive. To turn off this reporting, use ID = 0. If
the -U ID option is not given, then it defaults to -U 198
(since Attribute 198 is generally used to monitor offline
uncorrectable sectors).</p>

<p>If &acute;+&acute; is specified, a report is only
printed if the number of sectors has increased since the
last check cycle. Some disks do not reset this attribute
when a bad sector is reallocated. See also &acute;-v
198,increasing&acute; below.</p>

<p>An offline uncorrectable sector is a disk sector which
was not readable during an off-line scan or a self-test.
This is impor- tant to know, because if you have data stored
in this disk sec- tor, and you need to read it, the read
will fail. Please see the previous &acute;-C&acute; option
for more details.</p>

<p>-W DIFF[,INFO[,CRIT]] Report if the current temperature
had changed by at least DIFF degrees since last report, or
if new min or max temperature is detected. Report or Warn if
the temperature is greater or equal than one of INFO or CRIT
degrees Celsius. If the limit CRIT is reached, a message
with loglevel &acute;LOG_CRITICAL&acute; will be logged to
syslog and a warning email will be send if -m is specified.
If only the limit INFO is reached, a message with loglevel
&acute;LOG_INFO&acute; will be logged.</p>

<p>If this directive is used in conjunction with state
persistence (&acute;-s&acute; option), the min and max
temperature values are preserved across boot cycles. The
minimum temperature value is not updated during the first 30
minutes after startup.</p>

<p>To disable any of the 3 reports, set the corresponding
limit to 0. Trailing zero arguments may be omitted. By
default, all tem- perature reports are disabled (&acute;-W
0&acute;).</p>

<p>To track temperature changes of at least 2 degrees, use:
-W 2 To log informal messages on temperatures of at least 40
degrees, use: -W 0,40 For warning messages/mails on
temperatures of at least 45 degrees, use: -W 0,0,45 To
combine all of the above reports, use: -W 2,40,45</p>

<p>For ATA devices, smartd interprets Attribute 194 as
Temperature Celsius by default. This can be changed to
Attribute 9 or 220 by the drive database or by the
&acute;-v&acute; directive, see below.</p>

<p>-F TYPE [ATA only] Modifies the behavior of smartd to
compensate for some known and understood device firmware
bug. The arguments to this Directive are exclusive, so that
only the final Directive given is used. The valid values
are:</p>

<p>none - Assume that the device firmware obeys the ATA
specifica- tions. This is the default, unless the device has
presets for &acute;-F&acute; in the device database.</p>

<p>samsung - In some Samsung disks (example: model SV4012H
Firmware Version: RM100-08) some of the two- and four-byte
quantities in the SMART data structures are byte-swapped
(relative to the ATA specification). Enabling this option
tells smartd to evaluate these quantities in byte-reversed
order. Some signs that your disk needs this option are (1)
no self-test log printed, even though you have run
self-tests; (2) very large numbers of ATA errors reported in
the ATA error log; (3) strange and impossible values for the
ATA error log timestamps.</p>

<p>samsung2 - In more recent Samsung disks (firmware
revisions end- ing in &quot;-23&quot;) the number of ATA
errors reported is byte swapped. Enabling this option tells
smartd to evaluate this quantity in byte-reversed order.</p>

<p>samsung3 - Some Samsung disks (at least SP2514N with
Firmware VF100-37) report a self-test still in progress with
0% remaining when the test was already completed. If this
directive is speci- fied, smartd will not skip the next
scheduled self-test (see Directive &acute;-s&acute; above)
in this case.</p>

<p>Note that an explicit &acute;-F&acute; Directive will
over-ride any preset values for &acute;-F&acute; (see the
&acute;-P&acute; option below).</p>

<p>[Please see the smartctl -F command-line option.]</p>

<p>-v ID,FORMAT[,NAME] [ATA only] Sets a vendor-specific
raw value print FORMAT and optional NAME for Attribute ID.
This directive may be used mul- tiple times. Please see
smartctl -v command-line option for further details.</p>

<p>The following arguments affect smartd warning
output:</p>

<p>197,increasing - Raw Attribute number 197 (Current
Pending Sec- tor Count) is not reset if uncorrectable
sectors are reallo- cated. This sets &acute;-C 197+&acute;
if no other &acute;-C&acute; directive is speci- fied.</p>

<p>198,increasing - Raw Attribute number 198 (Offline
Uncorrectable Sector Count) is not reset if uncorrectable
sector are reallo- cated. This sets &acute;-U 198+&acute; if
no other &acute;-U&acute; directive is speci- fied.</p>

<p>-P TYPE Specifies whether smartd should use any preset
options that are available for this drive. The valid
arguments to this Directive are:</p>

<p>use - use any presets that are available for this drive.
This is the default.</p>

<p>ignore - do not use any presets for this drive.</p>

<p>show - show the presets listed for this drive in the
database.</p>

<p>showall - show the presets that are available for all
drives and then exit.</p>

<p>[Please see the smartctl -P command-line option.]</p>

<p>-a Equivalent to turning on all of the following
Directives: &acute;-H&acute; to check the SMART health
status, &acute;-f&acute; to report failures of Usage (rather
than Prefail) Attributes, &acute;-t&acute; to track changes
in both Prefailure and Usage Attributes, &acute;-l
selftest&acute; to report increases in the number of
Self-Test Log errors, &acute;-l error&acute; to report
increases in the number of ATA errors, &acute;-C 197&acute;
to report nonzero values of the current pending sector
count, and &acute;-U 198&acute; to report nonzero values of
the offline pending sector count.</p>

<p>Note that -a is the default for ATA devices. If none of
these other Directives is given, then -a is assumed.</p>

<p># Comment: ignore the remainder of the line.</p>

<p>Continuation character: if this is the last non-white or
non- comment character on a line, then the following line is
a con- tinuation of the current one.</p>

<p>If you are not sure which Directives to use, I suggest
experimenting for a few minutes with smartctl to see what
SMART functionality your disk(s) support(s). If you do not
like voluminous syslog messages, a good choice of smartd
configuration file Directives might be: -H -l selftest -l
error -f. If you want more frequent information, use:
-a.</p>

<p>ADDITIONAL DETAILS ABOUT DEVICESCAN If the first
non-comment entry in the configuration file is the text
string DEVICESCAN in capital letters, then smartd will
ignore any remaining lines in the configuration file, and
will scan for devices.</p>

<p>If DEVICESCAN is not followed by any Directives, then
smartd will scan for both ATA and SCSI devices, and will
monitor all possible SMART properties of any devices that
are found.</p>

<p>DEVICESCAN may optionally be followed by any valid
Directives, which will be applied to all devices that are
found in the scan. For example DEVICESCAN -m
root@example.com will scan for all devices, and then monitor
them. It will send one email warning per device for any
problems that are found. DEVICESCAN -d ata -m
root@example.com will do the same, but restricts the scan to
ATA devices only. DEVICESCAN -H -d ata -m root@example.com
will do the same, but only monitors the SMART health status
of the devices, (rather than the default -a, which monitors
all SMART properties).</p>

<p>EXAMPLES OF SHELL SCRIPTS FOR &acute;-M exec&acute;
These are two examples of shell scripts that can be used
with the &acute;-M exec PATH&acute; Directive described
previously. The paths to these scripts and similar
executables is the PATH argument to the &acute;-M exec
PATH&acute; Directive.</p>

<p>Example 1: This script is for use with &acute;-m ADDRESS
-M exec PATH&acute;. It appends the output of smartctl -a to
the output of the smartd email warning message and sends it
to ADDRESS.</p>

<p>#! /bin/bash</p>

<p># Save the email message (STDIN) to a file: cat &gt;
/root/msg</p>

<p># Append the output of smartctl -a to the message:
/usr/sbin/smartctl -a -d $SMART_DEVICETYPE $SMARTD_DEVICE
&gt;&gt; /root/msg</p>

<p># Now email the message to the user at address ADD:
/bin/mail -s &quot;$SMARTD_SUBJECT&quot; $SMARTD_ADDRESS
&lt; /root/msg</p>

<p>Example 2: This script is for use with &acute;-m
&lt;nomailer&gt; -M exec PATH&acute;. It warns all users
about a disk problem, waits 30 sec- onds, and then powers
down the machine.</p>

<p>#! /bin/bash</p>

<p># Warn all users of a problem wall &acute;Problem
detected with disk: &acute; &quot;$SMARTD_DEVICESTRING&quot;
wall &acute;Warning message from smartd is: &acute;
&quot;$SMARTD_MESSAGE&quot; wall &acute;Shutting down
machine in 30 seconds... &acute;</p>

<p># Wait half a minute sleep 30</p>

<p># Power down the machine /sbin/shutdown -hf now</p>

<p>Some example scripts are distributed with the
smartmontools package, in
/usr/share/doc/smartmontools-5.39.1/examplescripts/.</p>

<p>Please note that these scripts typically run as root, so
any files that they read/write should not be writable by
ordinary users or reside in directories like /tmp that are
writable by ordinary users and may expose your system to
symlink attacks.</p>

<p>As previously described, if the scripts write to STDOUT
or STDERR, this is interpreted as indicating that there was
an internal error within the script, and a snippet of
STDOUT/STDERR is logged to SYSLOG. The remainder is
flushed.</p>
