<p>NAME tapset::kprocess - systemtap kernel process probe
points</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This family of probe points is used to probe
the kernels process activities. It contains the following
probe points:</p>

<p>kprocess.create</p>

<p>Fires whenever a new process is successfully created,
either as a result of one of the fork syscall variants, or a
new kernel thread.</p>

<p>Arguments:</p>

<p>task a handle to the newly created process</p>

<p>new_pid pid of the newly created process</p>

<p>kprocess.start</p>

<p>Fires immediately before a new process begins
execution.</p>

<p>Arguments:</p>

<p>N/A</p>

<p>kprocess.exec</p>

<p>Fires whenever a process attempts to exec to a new
program</p>

<p>Arguments:</p>

<p>filename the path to the new executable</p>

<p>kprocess.exec_complete</p>

<p>Fires at the completion of an exec call</p>

<p>Arguments:</p>

<p>errno the error number resulting from the exec</p>

<p>success a boolean indicating whether the exec was
successful</p>

<p>kprocess.exit</p>

<p>Fires when a process terminates. This will always be
followed by a kprocess.release, though the latter may be
delayed if the pro- cess waits in a zombie state.</p>

<p>Arguments:</p>

<p>code the exit code of the process</p>

<p>kprocess.release</p>

<p>Fires when a process is released from the kernel. This
always follows a kprocess.exit, though it may be delayed
somewhat if the process waits in a zombie state.</p>

<p>Arguments:</p>

<p>task a task handle to the process being released</p>

<p>pid pid of the process being released</p>
