<p>NAME gnutls_ia_extract_inner_secret - API function</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;gnutls/extra.h&gt;</p>

<p>void gnutls_ia_extract_inner_secret(gnutls_session_t
session, char * buffer);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS gnutls_session_t session is a gnutls_session_t
structure.</p>

<p>char * buffer pre-allocated buffer to hold 48 bytes of
inner secret.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Copy the 48 bytes large inner secret into
the specified buffer</p>

<p>This function is typically used after the TLS/IA
handshake has con- cluded. The TLS/IA inner secret can be
used as input to a PRF to derive session keys. Do not use
the inner secret directly as a session key, because for a
resumed session that does not include an application phase,
the inner secret will be identical to the inner secret in
the original session. It is important to include, for
example, the client and server randomness when deriving a
sesssion key from the inner secret.</p>
