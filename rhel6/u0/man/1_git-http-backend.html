<p>GIT-HTTP-BACKEND(1) Git Manual GIT-HTTP-BACKEND(1)</p>

<p>NAME git-http-backend - Server side implementation of
Git over HTTP</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS git http-backend</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION A simple CGI program to serve the contents
of a Git repository to Git clients accessing the repository
over http:// and https:// protocols. The program supports
clients fetching using both the smart HTTP protocol and the
backwards-compatible dumb HTTP protocol, as well as clients
pushing using the smart HTTP protocol.</p>

<p>It verifies that the directory has the magic file
&quot;git-daemon-export-ok&quot;, and it will refuse to
export any git directory that hasnt explicitly been marked
for export this way (unless the GIT_HTTP_EXPORT_ALL
environmental variable is set).</p>

<p>By default, only the upload-pack service is enabled,
which serves git fetch-pack and git ls-remote clients, which
are invoked from git fetch, git pull, and git clone. If the
client is authenticated, the receive-pack service is
enabled, which serves git send-pack clients, which is
invoked from git push.</p>

<p>SERVICES These services can be enabled/disabled using
the per-repository configuration file:</p>

<p>http.getanyfile This serves Git clients older than
version 1.6.6 that are unable to use the upload pack
service. When enabled, clients are able to read any file
within the repository, including objects that are no longer
reachable from a branch but are still present. It is enabled
by default, but a repository can disable it by setting this
configuration item to false.</p>

<p>http.uploadpack This serves git fetch-pack and git
ls-remote clients. It is enabled by default, but a
repository can disable it by setting this configuration item
to false.</p>

<p>http.receivepack This serves git send-pack clients,
allowing push. It is disabled by default for anonymous
users, and enabled by default for users authenticated by the
web server. It can be disabled by setting this item to
false, or enabled for all users, including anonymous users,
by setting it to true.</p>

<p>URL TRANSLATION To determine the location of the
repository on disk, git http-backend concatenates the
environment variables PATH_INFO, which is set automatically
by the web server, and GIT_PROJECT_ROOT, which must be set
manually in the web server configuration. If
GIT_PROJECT_ROOT is not set, git http-backend reads
PATH_TRANSLATED, which is also set automatically by the web
server.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES All of the following examples map
http://$hostname/git/foo/bar.git to
/var/www/git/foo/bar.git.</p>

<p>Apache 2.x Ensure mod_cgi, mod_alias, and mod_env are
enabled, set GIT_PROJECT_ROOT (or DocumentRoot)
appropriately, and create a ScriptAlias to the CGI:</p>

<p>SetEnv GIT_PROJECT_ROOT /var/www/git SetEnv
GIT_HTTP_EXPORT_ALL ScriptAlias /git/
/usr/libexec/git-core/git-http-backend/</p>

<p>To enable anonymous read access but authenticated write
access, require authorization with a LocationMatch
directive:</p>

<p>&lt;LocationMatch
&quot;^/git/.*/git-receive-pack$&quot;&gt; AuthType Basic
AuthName &quot;Git Access&quot; Require group committers ...
&lt;/LocationMatch&gt;</p>

<p>To require authentication for both reads and writes, use
a Location directive around the repository, or one of its
parent directories:</p>

<p>&lt;Location /git/private&gt; AuthType Basic AuthName
&quot;Private Git Access&quot; Require group committers ...
&lt;/Location&gt;</p>

<p>To serve gitweb at the same url, use a ScriptAliasMatch
to only those URLs that git http-backend can handle, and
forward the rest to gitweb:</p>

<p>ScriptAliasMatch &quot;(?x)^/git/(.*/(HEAD | info/refs |
objects/(info/[^/]+ | [0-9a-f]{2}/[0-9a-f]{38} |
pack/pack-[0-9a-f]{40}.(pack|idx)) |
git-(upload|receive)-pack))$&quot;
/usr/libexec/git-core/git-http-backend/$1</p>

<p>ScriptAlias /git/ /var/www/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi/</p>

<p>Accelerated static Apache 2.x Similar to the above, but
Apache can be used to return static files that are stored on
disk. On many systems this may be more efficient as Apache
can ask the kernel to copy the file contents from the file
system directly to the network:</p>

<p>SetEnv GIT_PROJECT_ROOT /var/www/git</p>

<p>AliasMatch ^/git/(.*/objects/[0-9a-f]{2}/[0-9a-f]{38})$
/var/www/git/$1 AliasMatch
^/git/(.*/objects/pack/pack-[0-9a-f]{40}.(pack|idx))$
/var/www/git/$1 ScriptAlias /git/
/usr/libexec/git-core/git-http-backend/</p>

<p>This can be combined with the gitweb configuration:</p>

<p>SetEnv GIT_PROJECT_ROOT /var/www/git</p>

<p>AliasMatch ^/git/(.*/objects/[0-9a-f]{2}/[0-9a-f]{38})$
/var/www/git/$1 AliasMatch
^/git/(.*/objects/pack/pack-[0-9a-f]{40}.(pack|idx))$
/var/www/git/$1 ScriptAliasMatch &quot;(?x)^/git/(.*/(HEAD |
info/refs | objects/info/[^/]+ |
git-(upload|receive)-pack))$&quot;
/usr/libexec/git-core/git-http-backend/$1 ScriptAlias /git/
/var/www/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi/</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT git http-backend relies upon the CGI
environment variables set by the invoking web server,
including:</p>

<p>&middot; PATH_INFO (if GIT_PROJECT_ROOT is set,
otherwise PATH_TRANSLATED)</p>

<p>&middot; REMOTE_USER</p>

<p>&middot; REMOTE_ADDR</p>

<p>&middot; CONTENT_TYPE</p>

<p>&middot; QUERY_STRING</p>

<p>&middot; REQUEST_METHOD</p>

<p>The GIT_HTTP_EXPORT_ALL environmental variable may be
passed to git-http-backend to bypass the check for the
&quot;git-daemon-export-ok&quot; file in each repository
before allowing export of that repository.</p>

<p>The backend process sets GIT_COMMITTER_NAME to
$REMOTE_USER and GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL to
${REMOTE_USER}@http.${REMOTE_ADDR}, ensuring that any
reflogs created by git-receive-pack contain some identifying
information of the remote user who performed the push.</p>

<p>All CGI environment variables are available to each of
the hooks invoked by the git-receive-pack.</p>
