<p>NAME htdump - write out an ASCII-text version of the
document database</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS htdump [options]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Htdump writes out an ASCII-text version of
the document database in the same form as the -t option of
htdig.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -a Use alternate work files. Tells htdump to
append .work to database files, allowing it to operate on a
second set of databases.</p>

<p>-c configfile Use the specified configfile instead of
the default.</p>

<p>-v Verbose mode. This doesnt have much effect.</p>

<p>File Formats Document Database Each line in the file
starts with the document id followed by a list of fieldname
: value separated by tabs. The fields always appear in the
order listed below:</p>

<p>u URL</p>

<p>t Title</p>

<p>a State (0 = normal, 1 = not found, 2 = not indexed, 3 =
obsolete)</p>

<p>m Last modification time as reported by the server</p>

<p>s Size in bytes</p>

<p>H Excerpt</p>

<p>h Meta description</p>

<p>l Time of last retrieval</p>

<p>L Count of the links in the document (outgoing
links)</p>

<p>b Count of the links to the document (incoming links or
backlinks)</p>

<p>c HopCount of this document</p>

<p>g Signature of the document used for
duplicate-detection</p>

<p>e E-mail address to use for a notification message from
htnotify</p>

<p>n Date to send out a notification e-mail message</p>

<p>S Subject for a notification e-mail message</p>

<p>d The text of links pointing to this document. (e.g.
&lt;a href=&quot;docURL&quot;&gt;description&lt;/a&gt;)</p>

<p>A Anchors in the document (i.e. &lt;A NAME=...)</p>

<p>Word Database While htdump and htload dont deal with the
word database directly, its worth mentioning it here because
you need to deal with it when copying the ASCII databases
from one system to another. The initial word database
produced by htdig is already in ASCII format, and a binary
version of it is produced by htmerge, for use by htsearch.
So, when you copy over the ASCII version of the document
database produced by htdump, you need to copy over the
wordlist as well, then run htload to make the binary
document database on the target system, followed by run-
ning htmerge to make the word index.</p>

<p>Each line in the word list file starts with the word
followed by a list of fieldname : value separated by tabs.
The fields always appear in the order listed below, with the
last two being optional:</p>

<p>i Document ID</p>

<p>l Location of word in document (1 to 1000)</p>

<p>w Weight of word based on scoring factors</p>

<p>c Count of words appearances in document, if more than
1</p>

<p>a Anchor number if word occurred after a named
anchor</p>

<p>FILES /etc/htdig/htdig.conf The default configuration
file.</p>

<p>/var/lib/htdig/db.docs The default ASCII document
database file.</p>

<p>/var/lib/htdig/db.wordlist The default ASCII word
database file.</p>
