<p>NAME grmic - Generate stubs for Remote Method
Invocation</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS grmic [OPTION] ... class ...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION grmic is a utility included with
&quot;libgcj&quot; which generates stubs for remote
objects.</p>

<p>Note that this program isnt yet fully compatible with
the JDK grmic. Some options, such as -classpath, are
recognized but currently ignored. We have left these options
undocumented for now.</p>

<p>Long options can also be given with a GNU-style leading
--. For instance, --help is accepted.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -keep -keepgenerated By default, grmic deletes
intermediate files. Either of these options causes it not to
delete such files.</p>

<p>-v1.1 Cause grmic to create stubs and skeletons for the
1.1 protocol version.</p>

<p>-vcompat Cause grmic to create stubs and skeletons
compatible with both the 1.1 and 1.2 protocol versions. This
is the default.</p>

<p>-v1.2 Cause grmic to create stubs and skeletons for the
1.2 protocol version.</p>

<p>-nocompile Dont compile the generated files.</p>

<p>-verbose Print information about what grmic is
doing.</p>

<p>-d directory Put output files in directory. By default
the files are put in the current working directory.</p>

<p>-help Print a help message, then exit.</p>

<p>-version Print version information, then exit.</p>
