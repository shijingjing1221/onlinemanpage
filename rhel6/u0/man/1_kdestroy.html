<p>NAME kdestroy - destroy Kerberos tickets</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS kdestroy [-q] [-c cache_name]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The kdestroy utility destroys the users
active Kerberos authorization tickets by writing zeros to
the specified credentials cache that con- tains them. If the
credentials cache is not specified, the default credentials
cache is destroyed.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -q Run quietly. Normally kdestroy beeps if it
fails to destroy the user s tickets. The -q flag suppresses
this behavior.</p>

<p>-c cache_name use cache_name as the credentials (ticket)
cache name and loca- tion; if this option is not used, the
default cache name and location are used.</p>

<p>The default credentials cache may vary between systems.
If the KRB5CCNAME environment variable is set, its value is
used to name the default ticket cache.</p>

<p>Most installations recommend that you place the kdestroy
command in your .logout file, so that your tickets are
destroyed automatically when you log out.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT Kdestroy uses the following environment
variables:</p>

<p>KRB5CCNAME Location of the Kerberos 5 credentials
(ticket) cache.</p>

<p>FILES /tmp/krb5cc_[uid] default location of Kerberos 5
credentials cache ([uid] is the decimal UID of the
user).</p>

<p>SEE ALSO kinit(1), klist(1), krb5(3)</p>

<p>BUGS Only the tickets in the specified credentials cache
are destroyed. Separate ticket caches are used to hold root
instance and password changing tickets. These should
probably be destroyed too, or all of a users tickets kept in
a single credentials cache.</p>
