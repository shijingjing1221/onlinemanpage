<p>INNOCHECKSUM(1) MySQL Database System
INNOCHECKSUM(1)</p>

<p>NAME innochecksum - offline InnoDB file checksum
utility</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS innochecksum [options] file_name</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION innochecksum prints checksums for InnoDB
files. This tool reads an InnoDB tablespace file, calculates
the checksum for each page, compares the calculated checksum
to the stored checksum, and reports mismatches, which
indicate damaged pages. It was originally developed to speed
up verifying the integrity of tablespace files after power
outages but can also be used after file copies. Because
checksum mismatches will cause InnoDB to deliberately shut
down a running server, it can be preferable to use this tool
rather than waiting for a server in production usage to
encounter the damaged pages.</p>

<p>innochecksum cannot be used on tablespace files that the
server already has open. For such files, you should use
CHECK TABLE to check tables within the tablespace.</p>

<p>If checksum mismatches are found, you would normally
restore the tablespace from backup or start the server and
attempt to use mysqldump to make a backup of the tables
within the tablespace.</p>

<p>Invoke innochecksum like this:</p>

<p>shell&gt; innochecksum [options] file_name</p>

<p>innochecksum supports the following options. For options
that refer to page numbers, the numbers are zero-based.</p>

<p>&middot; -c</p>

<p>Print a count of the number of pages in the file.</p>

<p>&middot; -d</p>

<p>Debug mode; prints checksums for each page.</p>

<p>&middot; -e num</p>

<p>End at this page number.</p>

<p>&middot; -p num</p>

<p>Check only this page number.</p>

<p>&middot; -s num</p>

<p>Start at this page number.</p>

<p>&middot; -v</p>

<p>Verbose mode; print a progress indicator every five
seconds.</p>
