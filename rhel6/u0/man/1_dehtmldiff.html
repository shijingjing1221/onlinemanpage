<p>NAME dehtmldiff - get usable diff from an HTML page</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS dehtmldiff [file...]</p>

<p>dehtmldiff {[--help] | [--version]}</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION dehtmldiff creates usable diff files from
HTML pages. This is useful in the scenario where a patch has
been posted to a mailing list viewable via a web page.</p>

<p>The corrected diff is sent to standard output. Note that
you will probably need to use the -l option when applying
the patch, in order to ignore any whitespace differences
there may be.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --help Display a short usage message.</p>

<p>--version Display the version number of dehtmldiff.</p>

<p>LIMITATIONS The way this command works is fairly
primitive; it boils down to some simple text replacements,
followed by an unwrapdiff pass. As a result, all of the
limitations that apply to unwrapdiff also apply to
dehtmldiff.</p>
