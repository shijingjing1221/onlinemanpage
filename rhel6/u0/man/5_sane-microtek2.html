<p>sane-microtek2(5) SANE Scanner Access Now Easy
sane-microtek2(5)</p>

<p>NAME sane-microtek2 - SANE backend for Microtek scanners
with SCSI-2 command set</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sane-microtek2 library implements a SANE
(Scanner Access Now Easy) backend that provides access to
Microtek scanners with a SCSI-2 command set. This backend
can be considered alpha to beta. Some scanner models are
reported to work well, others not. New development versions
of this backend can be obtained from
http://karstenfestag.gmxhome.de</p>

<p>There exists a different backend for Microtek scanners
with SCSI-1 com- mand set. Refer to sane-microtek(5) for
details.</p>

<p>And there is work in progress for the ScanMaker 3600.
See http://sourceforge.net/projects/sm3600</p>

<p>At present, the following scanners are known positively
to work with this backend:</p>

<p>Additional information can be found at
http://www.sane-project.org/.</p>

<p>If you own a Microtek scanner other than the ones listed
above, it may or may not work with SANE! Because equal
scanners are sold under dif- ferent names in different
countries your model may be equivalent to one of the
above.</p>

<p>The parport scanners work with the ppscsi + onscsi
kernel modules. See
http://cyberelk.net/tim/parport/ppscsi.html and
http://penguin- breeder.org/kernel/download/.</p>

<p>The USB scanners work with the microtek kernel module.
You may have to add the vendor and model codes to microtek.c
if they aren t yet listed there.</p>

<p>Both parport and USB scanners need the generic SCSI
support, so check if you have loaded the scsi_mod and sg
modules!</p>

<p>If you try your scanner for the first time keep an eye
on it. If it gets commands that it doesnt understand the
scanhead may go beyond the scan area. The scanner then makes
strange noises. In this case immedi- ately switch off the
scanner or disconnect its power cable to prevent
damages!</p>

<p>If your scanner is a different one than the models
mentioned above and it is working please tell the author
about it. It would be nice if you add a logfile to this
information (creation of the logfile: see below).</p>

<p>If your scanner is not working properly you also should
create a log- file and send it to the author. He will use
the information to improve the backend and possibly make
your scanner work.</p>

<p>How to create the logfile?</p>

<p>- put the line &quot;option dump 2&quot; into your
microtek2.conf file or change the existing &quot;option
dump&quot; to &quot;2&quot;</p>

<p>- in a terminal (bash) type &quot;export
SANE_DEBUG_MICROTEK2=30&quot; and then &quot;scanimage -l0
-t0 -x100 -y20 2&gt;scan.log &gt;sout.pnm&quot; You get two
files: scan.log contains the logfile and sout.pnm the
scanned image (if there was scanned something). Zip them
before sending.</p>

<p>FRONTEND OPTIONS This backend dynamically enables the
options for the frontend, that are supported by the scanner
in dependence of the scanning-mode and other options. Not
supported options are disabled.</p>

<p>The following options are supported by the
Microtek2-driver:</p>

<p>Color, grayscale, halftone and lineart scans.</p>

<p>Highlight, midtone, shadow, contrast, brightness,
exposure time con- trol, gamma correction, threshold
(dependent of the scan mode and the scanner
capabilities)</p>

<p>Transparency media adapter, automatic document
feeder</p>

<p>Additional options can be enabled or disabled in the
microtek2.conf file. See the configuration section of this
manpage.</p>

<p>DEVICE NAMES This backend expects device names of the
form:</p>

<p>special</p>

<p>Where special is the UNIX path-name for the special
device that corre- sponds to the scanner. The special device
name must be a generic SCSI device or a symlink to such a
device. Under Linux, such a device name could be /dev/sga or
/dev/sge for example.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION The configuration file for this backend
resides in /etc/sane.d/microtek2.conf.</p>

<p>Its contents is a list of device names that correspond
to Microtek scanners with SCSI-2 interface. Empty lines and
lines starting with a hash mark (#) are ignored.</p>

<p>The configuration file may also contain options. Global
options that are valid for all devices are placed above the
device names. Device- specific options are placed under the
device name. Note that, except for option dump &lt;n&gt; and
option strip-height &lt;n&gt;, the entry in the
microtek2.conf file only enables the corresponding option
for being showed in the frontend. There, in the frontend,
you can switch the options on and off. Currently the
following options are supported:</p>

<p>option dump &lt;n&gt; option strip-height &lt;n&gt;
option no-backtrack-option &lt;on/off&gt; option lightlid-35
&lt;on/off&gt; option toggle-lamp &lt;on/off&gt; option
lineart-autoadjust &lt;on/off&gt; option backend-calibration
&lt;on/off&gt; option colorbalance-adjust &lt;on/off&gt;</p>

<p>option dump &lt;n&gt; enables printing of additional
information about the SCSI commands that are sent to the
scanner to stderr. This option is primarily useful for
debugging purpose. This option has to be a global option and
is best placed at the top of the microtek2.conf file.</p>

<p>If n=1 the contents of the command blocks and the
results for the INQUIRY and READ SCANNER ATTRIBUTES command
are printed to stderr.</p>

<p>If n=2 the contents of the command blocks for all other
SCSI commands are printed to stderr, too. If n=3 the
contents of the gamma table is printed, too. If n=4 all scan
data is additionally printed to stderr.</p>

<p>The default is n=1.</p>

<p>option strip-height &lt;n&gt; , where &lt;n&gt; is a
floating point number, limits the amount of data that is
read from the scanner with one read command. The unit is
inch and &lt;n&gt; defaults to 1.0, if this option is not
set in the configuration file. If less than &lt;n&gt; inch
of data fit into the SCSI buffer, then the smaller value is
used and this option has no effect.</p>

<p>If your system has a big SCSI buffer and you want to
make use of the whole buffer, increase the value for
&lt;n&gt;. For example, if &lt;n&gt; is set to 14.0, no
restrictions apply for scanners with a letter, legal or A4
sized scan area.</p>

<p>The following options enable or disable additional
frontend options. If an option is set to &lt;on&gt; an
appropriate option will appear in the fron- tend.</p>

<p>option no-backtrack-option &lt;on/off&gt; prevents the
scanner head from mov- ing backwards between the read
commands. This speeds up scanning. Try it.</p>

<p>option lightlid-35 &lt;on/off&gt; If you use the
LightLid-35 transparency adapter you get an advanced option
which switches off the flatbed lamp during the scan.</p>

<p>option toggle-lamp &lt;on/off&gt; You get a button in
the frontend where you can switch on and off the flatbed
lamp.</p>

<p>option lineart-autoadjust &lt;on/off&gt; You can tell
the backend to try to determine a good value for the lineart
threshold.</p>

<p>option backend-calibration &lt;on/off&gt; Some scanners
(e.g. Phantom 330CX and 636CX) need to have calibrated the
data by the backend. Try this option if you see vertical
stripes in your pictures.</p>

<p>option colorbalance-adjust &lt;on/off&gt; Some scanners
(e.g. Phantom 330CX and 636CX) need to have corrected the
color balance. If this option is enabled you get advanced
options where you can balance the colors. And you will have
a button to use the values that the firmware of the scan-
ner provides.</p>

<p>A sample configuration file is shown below:</p>

<p>option dump 1 option strip-height 1.0 /dev/scanner
option no-backtrack-option on # this is a comment /dev/sge
option lightlid-35 on</p>

<p>This backend also supports the new configuration file
format which makes it easier to detect scanners under Linux.
If you have only one scanner it would be best to use the
following configuration file for this backend:</p>

<p>option dump 1 option strip-height 14.0 option
no-backtrack-option on option backend-calibration on option
lightlid-35 on option toggle-lamp on option
lineart-autoadjust on option colorbalance-adjust off scsi *
* Scanner</p>

<p>In this case all SCSI-Scanners should be detected
automatically because of the</p>

<p>scsi * * Scanner</p>

<p>line.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/sane.d/microtek2.conf The backend
configuration file.</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-microtek2.a The static library
implementing this backend.</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-microtek2.so The shared library
implementing this backend (present on systems that support
dynamic loading).</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT SANE_DEBUG_MICROTEK2 If the library was
compiled with debug support enabled, this environment
variable controls the debug level for this backend. E.g., a
value of 255 requests all debug output to be printed.
Smaller levels reduce verbosity. To see error messages on
stderr set SANE_DEBUG_MICROTEK2 to 1 (Remark: The whole
debugging lev- els should be better revised). E.g. just say:
export SANE_DEBUG_MICROTEK2=128</p>
