<p>GETCONTEXT(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
GETCONTEXT(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME getcontext, setcontext - get and set current user
context</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;ucontext.h&gt;</p>

<p>int getcontext(ucontext_t *ucp); int setcontext(const
ucontext_t *ucp);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The getcontext() function shall initialize
the structure pointed to by ucp to the current user context
of the calling thread. The ucontext_t type that ucp points
to defines the user context and includes the con- tents of
the calling thread s machine registers, the signal mask, and
the current execution stack.</p>

<p>The setcontext() function shall restore the user context
pointed to by ucp. A successful call to setcontext() shall
not return; program execu- tion resumes at the point
specified by the ucp argument passed to set- context(). The
ucp argument should be created either by a prior call to
getcontext() or makecontext(), or by being passed as an
argument to a signal handler. If the ucp argument was
created with getcontext(), pro- gram execution continues as
if the corresponding call of getcontext() had just returned.
If the ucp argument was created with makecontext(), program
execution continues with the function passed to
makecontext(). When that function returns, the thread shall
continue as if after a call to setcontext() with the ucp
argument that was input to makecon- text(). If the uc_link
member of the ucontext_t structure pointed to by the ucp
argument is equal to 0, then this context is the main
context, and the thread shall exit when this context
returns. The effects of passing a ucp argument obtained from
any other source are unspecified.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, setcontext()
shall not return and getcon- text() shall return 0;
otherwise, a value of -1 shall be returned.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Refer to makecontext().</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE When a signal handler is executed, the
current user context is saved and a new context is created.
If the thread leaves the signal handler via longjmp(), then
it is unspecified whether the context at the time of the
corresponding setjmp() call is restored and thus whether
future calls to getcontext() provide an accurate
representation of the current context, since the context
restored by longjmp() does not necessarily contain all the
information that setcontext() requires. Signal handlers
should use siglongjmp() or setcontext() instead.</p>

<p>Conforming applications should not modify or access the
uc_mcontext member of ucontext_t. A conforming application
cannot assume that con- text includes any process-wide
static data, possibly including errno. Users manipulating
contexts should take care to handle these explicitly when
required.</p>

<p>Use of contexts to create alternate stacks is not
defined by this vol- ume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
