_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Tk_SetClass is called to associate a class
with a particular window. The class string identifies the
type of the window; all windows with the same general class
of behavior (button, menu, etc.) should have the same class.
By convention all class names start with a capital letter,
and there exists a Tcl command with the same name as each
class (except all in lower-case) which can be used to create
and manipulate windows of that class. A windows class string
is initialized to NULL when the window is created.</p>

<p>For main windows, Tk automatically propagates the name
and class to the WM_CLASS property used by window managers.
This happens either when a main window is actually created
(e.g. in Tk_MakeWindowExist), or when Tk_SetClass is called,
whichever occurs later. If a main window has not been
assigned a class then Tk will not set the WM_CLASS property
for the window.</p>

<p>Tk_Class is a macro that returns the current value of
tkwins class. The value is returned as a Tk_Uid, which may
be used just like a string pointer but also has the
properties of a unique identifier (see the manual entry for
Tk_GetUid for details). If tkwin has not yet been given a
class, then Tk_Class will return NULL.</p>
