<p>XGrabButton(3) XLIB FUNCTIONS XGrabButton(3)</p>

<p>NAME XGrabButton, XUngrabButton - grab pointer
buttons</p>

<p>SYNTAX int XGrabButton(Display *display, unsigned int
button, unsigned int modifiers, Window grab_window, Bool
owner_events, unsigned int event_mask, int pointer_mode,
keyboard_mode, Window confine_to, Cursor cursor);</p>

<p>int XUngrabButton(Display *display, unsigned int button,
unsigned int modifiers, Window grab_window);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS button Specifies the pointer button that is to
be grabbed or released or AnyButton.</p>

<p>confine_to Specifies the window to confine the pointer
in or None.</p>

<p>cursor Specifies the cursor that is to be displayed or
None.</p>

<p>display Specifies the connection to the X server.</p>

<p>event_mask Specifies which pointer events are reported
to the client. The mask is the bitwise inclusive OR of the
valid pointer event mask bits.</p>

<p>grab_window Specifies the grab window.</p>

<p>keyboard_mode Specifies further processing of keyboard
events. You can pass GrabModeSync or GrabModeAsync.</p>

<p>modifiers Specifies the set of keymasks or AnyModifier.
The mask is the bitwise inclusive OR of the valid keymask
bits.</p>

<p>owner_events Specifies a Boolean value that indicates
whether the pointer events are to be reported as usual or
reported with respect to the grab window if selected by the
event mask.</p>

<p>pointer_mode Specifies further processing of pointer
events. You can pass GrabModeSync or GrabModeAsync.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The XGrabButton function establishes a
passive grab. In the future, the pointer is actively grabbed
(as for XGrabPointer), the last- pointer-grab time is set to
the time at which the button was pressed (as transmitted in
the ButtonPress event), and the ButtonPress event is
reported if all of the following conditions are true:</p>

<p>&middot; The pointer is not grabbed, and the specified
button is logically pressed when the specified modifier keys
are logically down, and no other buttons or modifier keys
are logically down.</p>

<p>&middot; The grab_window contains the pointer.</p>

<p>&middot; The confine_to window (if any) is viewable.</p>

<p>&middot; A passive grab on the same button/key
combination does not exist on any ancestor of
grab_window.</p>

<p>The interpretation of the remaining arguments is as for
XGrabPointer. The active grab is terminated automatically
when the logical state of the pointer has all buttons
released (independent of the state of the logical modifier
keys), at which point a ButtonRelease event is reported to
the grabbing window.</p>

<p>Note that the logical state of a device (as seen by
client applica- tions) may lag the physical state if device
event processing is frozen.</p>

<p>This request overrides all previous grabs by the same
client on the same button/key combinations on the same
window. A modifiers of Any- Modifier is equivalent to
issuing the grab request for all possible modifier
combinations (including the combination of no modifiers). It
is not required that all modifiers specified have currently
assigned KeyCodes. A button of AnyButton is equivalent to
issuing the request for all possible buttons. Otherwise, it
is not required that the spec- ified button currently be
assigned to a physical button.</p>

<p>If some other client has already issued a XGrabButton
with the same button/key combination on the same window, a
BadAccess error results. When using AnyModifier or
AnyButton, the request fails completely, and a BadAccess
error results (no grabs are established) if there is a con-
flicting grab for any combination. XGrabButton has no effect
on an active grab.</p>

<p>XGrabButton can generate BadCursor, BadValue, and
BadWindow errors.</p>

<p>The XUngrabButton function releases the passive
button/key combination on the specified window if it was
grabbed by this client. A modifiers of AnyModifier is
equivalent to issuing the ungrab request for all pos- sible
modifier combinations, including the combination of no
modifiers. A button of AnyButton is equivalent to issuing
the request for all pos- sible buttons. XUngrabButton has no
effect on an active grab.</p>

<p>XUngrabButton can generate BadValue and BadWindow
errors.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS BadCursor A value for a Cursor argument does
not name a defined Cursor.</p>

<p>BadValue Some numeric value falls outside the range of
values accepted by the request. Unless a specific range is
specified for an argument, the full range defined by the
argument s type is accepted. Any argument defined as a set
of alternatives can generate this error.</p>

<p>BadWindow A value for a Window argument does not name a
defined Window.</p>
