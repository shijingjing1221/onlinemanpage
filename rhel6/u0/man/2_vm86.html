<p>VM86(2) Linux Programmer s Manual VM86(2)</p>

<p>NAME vm86old, vm86 - enter virtual 8086 mode</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/vm86.h&gt;</p>

<p>int vm86old(struct vm86_struct *info);</p>

<p>int vm86(unsigned long fn, struct vm86plus_struct
*v86);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The system call vm86() was introduced in
Linux 0.97p2. In Linux 2.1.15 and 2.0.28 it was renamed to
vm86old(), and a new vm86() was intro- duced. The definition
of struct vm86_struct was changed in 1.1.8 and 1.1.9.</p>

<p>These calls cause the process to enter VM86 mode
(virtual-8086 in Intel literature), and are used by
dosemu.</p>

<p>VM86 mode is an emulation of real mode within a
protected mode task.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, zero is returned. On error, -1
is returned, and errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS EFAULT This return value is specific to i386 and
indicates a problem with getting userspace data.</p>

<p>ENOSYS This return value indicates the call is not
implemented on the present architecture.</p>

<p>EPERM Saved kernel stack exists. (This is a kernel
sanity check; the saved stack should only exist within vm86
mode itself.)</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO This call is specific to Linux on 32-bit
Intel processors, and should not be used in programs
intended to be portable.</p>

<p>COLOPHON This page is part of release 3.22 of the Linux
man-pages project. A description of the project, and
information about reporting bugs, can be found at
