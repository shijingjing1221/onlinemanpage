<p>DESCRIPTION lp submits files for printing or alters a
pending job. Use a filename of &quot;-&quot; to force
printing from the standard input.</p>

<p>THE DEFAULT DESTINATION CUPS provides many ways to set
the default destination. The &quot;LPDEST&quot; and
&quot;PRINTER&quot; environment variables are consulted
first. If neither are set, the current default set using the
lpoptions(1) command is used, followed by the default set
using the lpadmin(8) command.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The following options are recognized by lp:</p>

<p>-- Marks the end of options; use this to print a file
whose name begins with a dash (-).</p>

<p>-E Forces encryption when connecting to the server.</p>

<p>-U username Specifies the username to use when
connecting to the server.</p>

<p>-c This option is provided for backwards-compatibility
only. On sys- tems that support it, this option forces the
print file to be copied to the spool directory before
printing. In CUPS, print files are always sent to the
scheduler via IPP which has the same effect.</p>

<p>-d destination Prints files to the named printer.</p>

<p>-h hostname[:port] Chooses an alternate server.</p>

<p>-i job-id Specifies an existing job to modify.</p>

<p>-m Sends an email when the job is completed.</p>

<p>-n copies Sets the number of copies to print from 1 to
100.</p>

<p>-o &quot;name=value [name=value ...]&quot; Sets one or
more job options.</p>

<p>-q priority Sets the job priority from 1 (lowest) to 100
(highest). The default priority is 50.</p>

<p>-s Do not report the resulting job IDs (silent
mode.)</p>

<p>-t &quot;name&quot; Sets the job name.</p>

<p>-u username Submits jobs as username.</p>

<p>-H hh:mm</p>

<p>-H hold</p>

<p>-H immediate</p>

<p>-H restart</p>

<p>-H resume Specifies when the job should be printed. A
value of immediate will print the file immediately, a value
of hold will hold the job indefinitely, and a time value
(HH:MM) will hold the job until the specified time. Use a
value of resume with the -i option to resume a held job. Use
a value of restart with the -i option to restart a completed
job.</p>

<p>-P page-list Specifies which pages to print in the
document. The list can con- tain a list of numbers and
ranges (#-#) separated by commas (e.g. 1,3-5,16). The page
numbers refer to the output pages and not the document s
original pages - options like &quot;number-up&quot; can
affect the numbering of the pages. that are</p>

<p>COMMON JOB OPTIONS Aside from the printer-specific
options reported by the lpoptions(1) command, the following
generic options are available:</p>

<p>-o media=size Sets the page size to size. Most printers
support at least the size names &quot;a4&quot;,
&quot;letter&quot;, and &quot;legal&quot;.</p>

<p>-o landscape</p>

<p>-o orientation-requested=4 Prints the job in landscape
(rotated 90 degrees).</p>

<p>-o sides=one-sided</p>

<p>-o sides=two-sided-long-edge</p>

<p>-o sides=two-sided-short-edge Prints on one or two sides
of the paper. The value &quot;two-sided- long-edge&quot; is
normally used when printing portrait (unrotated) pages,
while &quot;two-sided-short-edge&quot; is used for landscape
pages.</p>

<p>-o fitplot Scales the print file to fit on the page.</p>

<p>-o number-up=2</p>

<p>-o number-up=4</p>

<p>-o number-up=6</p>

<p>-o number-up=9</p>

<p>-o number-up=16 Prints multiple document pages on each
output page.</p>

<p>-o scaling=number Scales image files to use up to number
percent of the page. Val- ues greater than 100 cause the
image file to be printed across multiple pages.</p>

<p>-o cpi=N Sets the number of characters per inch to use
when printing a text file. The default is 10.</p>

<p>-o lpi=N Sets the number of lines per inch to use when
printing a text file. The default is 6.</p>

<p>-o page-bottom=N</p>

<p>-o page-left=N</p>

<p>-o page-right=N</p>

<p>-o page-top=N Sets the page margins when printing text
files. The values are in points - there are 72 points to the
inch.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Print a double-sided legal document to a
printer called &quot;foo&quot;: lp -d foo -o media=legal -o
sides=two-sided-long-edge filename</p>

<p>Print an image across 4 pages: lp -d bar -o scaling=200
filename</p>

<p>Print a text file with 12 characters per inch, 8 lines
per inch, and a 1 inch left margin: lp -d bar -o cpi=12 -o
lpi=8 -o page-left=72 filename</p>

<p>COMPATIBILITY Unlike the System V printing system, CUPS
allows printer names to con- tain any printable character
except SPACE, TAB, &quot;/&quot;, or &quot;#&quot;. Also,
printer and class names are not case-sensitive.</p>

<p>The &quot;q&quot; option accepts a different range of
values than the Solaris lp command, matching the IPP job
priority values (1-100, 100 is highest priority) instead of
the Solaris values (0-39, 0 is highest priority).</p>
