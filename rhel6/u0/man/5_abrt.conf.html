<p>NAME abrt.conf - configuration file for abrt</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION abrt is a daemon that watches for
application crashes. When a crash occurs, it collects the
crash data and takes action according to its configuration.
This manual page describes abrt s configuration file.</p>

<p>The configuration file consists of sections, each
section contains sev- eral items in the format &quot;Option
= Value&quot;. A description of each sec- tion follows:</p>

<p>[Common] OpenGPGCheck = yes | no When set to
&quot;yes&quot;, abrt will report crashes only in GPG signed
packages. When set to &quot;no&quot;, it will report crashes
also in unsigned packages. The default is
&quot;no&quot;.</p>

<p>OpenGPGPublicKeys = filename , filename ... These are
the trusted GPG keys with which packages have to be signed
for abrt to report them if &quot;OpenGPGCheck =
yes&quot;.</p>

<p>BlackList = packageName, packageName ... abrt will
ignore packages in this list and will not handle their
crashes.</p>

<p>BlackListedPaths = /path/to/ignore/*,
*/another/ignored/path* ... abrt will ignore crashes in
executables whose absolute path matches one of specified
patterns.</p>

<p>Database = databasePlugin This specifies which database
plugin abrt uses to store metadata about the crash.</p>

<p>MaxCrashReportsSize = number The maximum disk space
(specified in megabytes) that abrt will use for all the
crash dumps. Specify a value here to ensure that the crash
dumps will not fill all available storage space. The default
is 1000.</p>

<p>ActionsAndReporters = plugin, plugin(parameters) List of
reporter and action plugins which will be run at crash
time.</p>

<p>ProcessUnpackaged = yes | no When set to
&quot;yes&quot;, abrt will catch all crashes in the system.
When set to &quot;no&quot;, it will catch crashes only in
Fedora packages. The default is &quot;no&quot;.</p>

<p>[ AnalyzerActionsAndReporters ] This section contains
associations between analyzers and action or reporter
plugins.</p>

<p>CCpp = plugin abrt will use this plugin when a C/C++
program crashes. You can specify a plugin for specific
program, for example CCpp:bind = Mailx(&quot;[abrt] Bind
crashed&quot;) The Mailx plugin will run when bind crashes,
instead of the plu- gin specified for all the C/C++
programs.</p>

<p>Kerneloops = plugin This plugin will be used in the case
of kernel crashes.</p>

<p>[ Cron ] This section specifies tasks that will be run
at some specified time. You can specify either a time of day
in the format hh:mm = plugin or an interval ss = plugin2 in
this case, plugin2 will be run every ss seconds (this number
can be greater than 60).</p>
