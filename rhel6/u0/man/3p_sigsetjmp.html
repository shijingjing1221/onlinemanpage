<p>SIGSETJMP(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
SIGSETJMP(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME sigsetjmp - set jump point for a non-local goto</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;setjmp.h&gt;</p>

<p>int sigsetjmp(sigjmp_buf env, int savemask);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sigsetjmp() function shall be equivalent
to the setjmp() function, except as follows:</p>

<p>* References to setjmp() are equivalent to
sigsetjmp().</p>

<p>* References to longjmp() are equivalent to
siglongjmp().</p>

<p>* If the value of the savemask argument is not 0,
sigsetjmp() shall also save the current signal mask of the
calling thread as part of the calling environment.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE If the return is from a successful direct
invocation, sigsetjmp() shall return 0. If the return is
from a call to siglongjmp(), sigsetjmp() shall return a
non-zero value.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The distinction between setjmp()/
longjmp() and sigsetjmp()/ sig- longjmp() is only
significant for programs which use sigaction(), sig-
procmask(), or sigsuspend().</p>

<p>Note that since this function is defined in terms of
setjmp(), if save- mask is zero, it is unspecified whether
the signal mask is saved.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The ISO C standard specifies various
restrictions on the usage of the setjmp() macro in order to
permit implementors to recognize the name in the compiler
and not implement an actual function. These same restric-
tions apply to the sigsetjmp() macro.</p>

<p>There are processors that cannot easily support these
calls, but this was not considered a sufficient reason to
exclude them.</p>

<p>4.2 BSD, 4.3 BSD, and XSI-conformant systems provide
functions named _setjmp() and _longjmp() that, together with
setjmp() and longjmp(), provide the same functionality as
sigsetjmp() and siglongjmp(). On those systems, setjmp() and
longjmp() save and restore signal masks, while _setjmp() and
_longjmp() do not. On System V Release 3 and in
corresponding issues of the SVID, setjmp() and longjmp() are
explicitly defined not to save and restore signal masks. In
order to permit exist- ing practice in both cases, the
relation of setjmp() and longjmp() to signal masks is not
specified, and a new set of functions is defined
instead.</p>

<p>The longjmp() and siglongjmp() functions operate as in
the previous issue provided the matching setjmp() or
sigsetjmp() has been performed in the same thread. Non-local
jumps into contexts saved by other threads would be at best
a questionable practice and were not consid- ered worthy of
standardization.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
