<p>NAME slapo-accesslog - Access Logging overlay to
slapd</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS /etc/openldap/slapd.conf</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The Access Logging overlay can be used to
record all accesses to a given backend database on another
database. This allows all of the activity on a given
database to be reviewed using arbitrary LDAP queries,
instead of just logging to local flat text files. Configura-
tion options are available for selecting a subset of
operation types to log, and to automatically prune older log
records from the logging database. Log records are stored
with audit schema (see below) to assure their readability
whether viewed as LDIF or in raw form.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION These slapd.conf options apply to the
Access Logging overlay. They should appear after the overlay
directive.</p>

<p>logdb &lt;suffix&gt; Specify the suffix of a database to
be used for storing the log records. The specified database
must be defined elsewhere in the configuration. The access
controls on the log database should prevent general access.
The suffix entry of the log database will be created
automatically by this overlay. The log entries will be
generated as the immediate children of the suf- fix
entry.</p>

<p>logops &lt;operations&gt; Specify which types of
operations to log. The valid operation types are abandon,
add, bind, compare, delete, extended, modify, modrdn,
search, and unbind. Aliases for common sets of opera- tions
are also available:</p>

<p>writes add, delete, modify, modrdn</p>

<p>reads compare, search</p>

<p>session abandon, bind, unbind</p>

<p>all all operations</p>

<p>logold &lt;filter&gt; Specify a filter for matching
against Deleted and Modified entries. If the entry matches
the filter, the old contents of the entry will be logged
along with the current request.</p>

<p>logoldattr &lt;attr&gt; ... Specify a list of attributes
whose old contents are always logged in Modify and ModRDN
requests. Usually only the contents of attributes that were
actually modified will be logged; by default no old
attributes are logged for ModRDN requests.</p>

<p>logpurge &lt;age&gt; &lt;interval&gt; Specify the
maximum age for log entries to be retained in the database,
and how often to scan the database for old entries. Both the
age and interval are specified as a time span in days,
hours, minutes, and seconds. The time format is
[ddd+]hh:mm[:ss] i.e., the days and seconds components are
optional but hours and minutes are required. Except for
days, which can be up to 5 digits, each numeric field must
be exactly two digits. For exam- ple logpurge 2+00:00
1+00:00 would specify that the log database should be
scanned every day for old entries, and entries older than
two days should be deleted. When using a log database that
supports ordered index- ing on generalizedTime attributes,
specifying an eq index on the reqStart attribute will
greatly benefit the performance of the purge operation.</p>

<p>logsuccess TRUE | FALSE If set to TRUE then log records
will only be generated for suc- cessful requests, i.e.,
requests that produce a result code of 0 (LDAP_SUCCESS). If
FALSE, log records are generated for all requests whether
they succeed or not. The default is FALSE.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES database bdb suffix dc=example,dc=com ...

<p>database bdb suffix cn=log ... index reqStart eq access

read</p>

<p>SCHEMA The accesslog overlay utilizes the
&quot;audit&quot; schema described herein. This schema is
specifically designed for accesslog auditing and is not
intended to be used otherwise. It is also noted that the
schema described here is a work in progress, and hence
subject to change with- out notice. The schema is loaded
automatically by the overlay.</p>

<p>The schema includes a number of object classes and
associated attribute types as described below.</p>

<p>There is a basic auditObject class from which two
additional classes, auditReadObject and auditWriteObject are
derived. Object classes for each type of LDAP operation are
further derived from these classes. This object class
hierarchy is designed to allow flexible yet efficient
searches of the log based on either a specific operation
types class, or on more general classifications. The
definition of the auditObject class is as follows:</p>

<p>( 1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.666.11.5.2.1 NAME auditObject DESC
OpenLDAP request auditing SUP top STRUCTURAL MUST ( reqStart
$ reqType $ reqSession ) MAY ( reqDN $ reqAuthzID $
reqControls $ reqRespControls $ reqEnd $ reqResult $
reqMessage $ reqReferral ) )</p>

<p>Note that all of the OIDs used in the logging schema
currently reside under the OpenLDAP Experimental branch. It
is anticipated that they will migrate to a Standard branch
in the future.</p>

<p>An overview of the attributes follows: reqStart and
reqEnd provide the start and end time of the operation,
respectively. They use generalizedTime syntax. The reqStart
attribute is also used as the RDN for each log entry.</p>

<p>The reqType attribute is a simple string containing the
type of opera- tion being logged, e.g. add, delete, search,
etc. For extended opera- tions, the type also includes the
OID of the extended operation, e.g. extended(1.1.1.1)</p>

<p>The reqSession attribute is an implementation-specific
identifier that is common to all the operations associated
with the same LDAP session. Currently this is slapds
internal connection ID, stored in decimal.</p>

<p>The reqDN attribute is the distinguishedName of the
target of the oper- ation. E.g., for a Bind request, this is
the Bind DN. For an Add request, this is the DN of the entry
being added. For a Search request, this is the base DN of
the search.</p>

<p>The reqAuthzID attribute is the distinguishedName of the
user that per- formed the operation. This will usually be
the same name as was estab- lished at the start of a session
by a Bind request (if any) but may be altered in various
circumstances.</p>

<p>The reqControls and reqRespControls attributes carry any
controls sent by the client on the request and returned by
the server in the response, respectively. The attribute
values are just uninterpreted octet strings.</p>

<p>The reqResult attribute is the numeric LDAP result code
of the opera- tion, indicating either success or a
particular LDAP error code. An error code may be accompanied
by a text error message which will be recorded in the
reqMessage attribute.</p>

<p>The reqReferral attribute carries any referrals that
were returned with the result of the request.</p>

<p>Operation-specific classes are defined with additional
attributes to carry all of the relevant parameters
associated with the operation:</p>

<p>( 1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.666.11.5.2.4 NAME auditAbandon DESC
Abandon operation SUP auditObject STRUCTURAL MUST reqId
)</p>

<p>For the Abandon operation the reqId attribute contains
the message ID of the request that was abandoned.</p>

<p>( 1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.666.11.5.2.5 NAME auditAdd DESC Add
operation SUP auditWriteObject STRUCTURAL MUST reqMod )</p>

<p>The Add class inherits from the auditWriteObject class.
The Add and Modify classes are very similar. The reqMod
attribute carries all of the attributes of the original
entry being added. (Or in the case of a Modify operation,
all of the modifications being performed.) The values are
formatted as attribute:&lt;+|-|=|#&gt; [ value] Where +
indicates an Add of a value, - for Delete, = for Replace,
and # for Increment. In an Add operation, all of the reqMod
values will have the + designator.</p>

<p>( 1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.666.11.5.2.6 NAME auditBind DESC Bind
operation SUP auditObject STRUCTURAL MUST ( reqVersion $
reqMethod ) )</p>

<p>The Bind class includes the reqVersion attribute which
contains the LDAP protocol version specified in the Bind as
well as the reqMethod attribute which contains the Bind
Method used in the Bind. This will be the string SIMPLE for
LDAP Simple Binds or SASL(&lt;mech&gt;) for SASL Binds. Note
that unless configured as a global overlay, only Simple
Binds using DNs that reside in the current database will be
logged.</p>

<p>( 1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.666.11.5.2.7 NAME auditCompare DESC
Compare operation SUP auditObject STRUCTURAL MUST
reqAssertion )</p>

<p>For the Compare operation the reqAssertion attribute
carries the Attribute Value Assertion used in the compare
request.</p>

<p>( 1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.666.11.5.2.8 NAME auditDelete DESC
Delete operation SUP auditWriteObject STRUCTURAL MAY reqOld
)</p>

<p>The Delete operation needs no further parameters.
However, the reqOld attribute may optionally be used to
record the contents of the entry prior to its deletion. The
values are formatted as attribute: value The reqOld
attribute is only populated if the entry being deleted
matches the configured logold filter.</p>

<p>( 1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.666.11.5.2.9 NAME auditModify DESC
Modify operation SUP auditWriteObject STRUCTURAL MAY reqOld
MUST reqMod )</p>

<p>The Modify operation contains a description of
modifications in the reqMod attribute, which was already
described above in the Add opera- tion. It may optionally
contain the previous contents of any modified attributes in
the reqOld attribute, using the same format as described
above for the Delete operation. The reqOld attribute is only
populated if the entry being modified matches the configured
logold filter.</p>

<p>( 1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.666.11.5.2.10 NAME auditModRDN DESC
ModRDN operation SUP auditWriteObject STRUCTURAL MUST (
reqNewRDN $ reqDeleteOldRDN ) MAY ( reqNewSuperior $ reqOld
) )</p>

<p>The ModRDN class uses the reqNewRDN attribute to carry
the new RDN of the request. The reqDeleteOldRDN attribute is
a Boolean value showing TRUE if the old RDN was deleted from
the entry, or FALSE if the old RDN was preserved. The
reqNewSuperior attribute carries the DN of the new parent
entry if the request specified the new parent. The reqOld
attribute is only populated if the entry being modified
matches the configured logold filter and contains attributes
in the logoldattr list.</p>

<p>( 1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.666.11.5.2.11 NAME auditSearch DESC
Search operation SUP auditReadObject STRUCTURAL MUST (
reqScope $ reqDerefAliases $ reqAttrsOnly ) MAY ( reqFilter
$ reqAttr $ reqEntries $ reqSizeLimit $ reqTimeLimit ) )</p>

<p>For the Search class the reqScope attribute contains the
scope of the original search request, using the values
specified for the LDAP URL format. I.e. base, one, sub, or
subord. The reqDerefAliases attribute is one of never,
finding, searching, or always, denoting how aliases will be
processed during the search. The reqAttrsOnly attribute is a
Boolean value showing TRUE if only attribute names were
requested, or FALSE if attributes and their values were
requested. The reqFilter attribute carries the filter used
in the search request. The reqAttr attribute lists the
requested attributes if specific attributes were requested.
The reqEntries attribute is the integer count of how many
entries were returned by this search request. The
reqSizeLimit and reqTimeLimit attributes indicate what
limits were requested on the search operation.</p>

<p>( 1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.666.11.5.2.12 NAME auditExtended DESC
Extended operation SUP auditObject STRUCTURAL MAY reqData
)</p>

<p>The Extended class represents an LDAP Extended
Operation. As noted above, the actual OID of the operation
is included in the reqType attribute of the parent class. If
any optional data was provided with the request, it will be
contained in the reqData attribute as an unin- terpreted
octet string.</p>

<p>NOTES The Access Log implemented by this overlay may be
used for a variety of other tasks, e.g. as a ChangeLog for a
replication mechanism, as well as for security/audit logging
purposes.</p>
