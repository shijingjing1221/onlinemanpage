<p>KBD_MODE(1) KBD_MODE(1)</p>

<p>NAME kbd_mode - report or set the keyboard mode</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS kbd_mode [ -a | -u | -k | -s ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Without argument, kbd_mode prints the
current keyboard mode (RAW, MEDI- UMRAW or XLATE). With
argument, it sets the keyboard mode as indi- cated:</p>

<p>-s: scancode mode (RAW),</p>

<p>-k: keycode mode (MEDIUMRAW),</p>

<p>-a: ASCII mode (XLATE),</p>

<p>-u: UTF-8 mode (UNICODE).</p>

<p>Of course the &quot;-a&quot; is only traditional, and
the code used can be any 8-bit character set. With
&quot;-u&quot; a 16-bit character set is expected, and these
chars are transmitted to the kernel as 1, 2, or 3 bytes
(follow- ing the UTF-8 coding). In these latter two modes
the key mapping defined by loadkeys(1) is used.</p>

<p>Warning: changing the keyboard mode, other than between
ASCII and Uni- code, will probably make your keyboard
unusable. This command is only meant for use (say via remote
login) when some program left your key- board in the wrong
state. Note that in some obsolete versions of this program
the &quot;-u&quot; option was a synonym for
&quot;-s&quot;.</p>
