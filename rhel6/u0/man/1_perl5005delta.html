<p>PERL5005DELTA(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERL5005DELTA(1)</p>

<p>NAME perl5005delta - whats new for perl5.005</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This document describes differences between
the 5.004 release and this one.</p>

<p>About the new versioning system Perl is now developed on
two tracks: a maintenance track that makes small, safe
updates to released production versions with emphasis on
compatibility; and a development track that pursues more
aggressive evolution. Maintenance releases (which should be
considered production quality) have subversion numbers that
run from 1 to 49, and development releases (which should be
considered &quot;alpha&quot; quality) run from 50 to 99.</p>

<p>Perl 5.005 is the combined product of the new dual-track
development scheme.</p>

<p>Incompatible Changes WARNING: This version is not binary
compatible with Perl 5.004. Starting with Perl 5.004_50
there were many deep and far-reaching changes to the
language internals. If you have dynamically loaded
extensions that you built under perl 5.003 or 5.004, you can
continue to use them with 5.004, but you will need to
rebuild and reinstall those extensions to use them 5.005.
See INSTALL for detailed instructions on how to upgrade.</p>

<p>Default installation structure has changed The new
Configure defaults are designed to allow a smooth upgrade
from 5.004 to 5.005, but you should read INSTALL for a
detailed discussion of the changes in order to adapt them to
your system.</p>

<p>Perl Source Compatibility When none of the experimental
features are enabled, there should be very few user-visible
Perl source compatibility issues.</p>

<p>If threads are enabled, then some caveats apply. @_ and
$_ become lexical variables. The effect of this should be
largely transparent to the user, but there are some boundary
conditions under which user will need to be aware of the
issues. For example, &quot;local(@_)&quot; results in a
&quot;Cant localize lexical variable @_ ...&quot; message.
This may be enabled in a future version.</p>

<p>Some new keywords have been introduced. These are
generally expected to have very little impact on
compatibility. See &quot;New &quot;INIT&quot; keyword&quot;,
&quot;New &quot;lock&quot; keyword&quot;, and &quot;New
&quot;qr//&quot; operator&quot;.</p>

<p>Certain barewords are now reserved. Use of these will
provoke a warning if you have asked for them with the
&quot;-w&quot; switch. See &quot;&quot;our&quot; is now a
reserved word&quot;.</p>

<p>C Source Compatibility There have been a large number of
changes in the internals to support the new features in this
release.</p>

<p>&middot; Core sources now require ANSI C compiler</p>

<p>An ANSI C compiler is now required to build perl. See
INSTALL.</p>

<p>&middot; All Perl global variables must now be
referenced with an explicit prefix</p>

<p>All Perl global variables that are visible for use by
extensions now have a &quot;PL_&quot; prefix. New extensions
should &quot;not&quot; refer to perl globals by their
unqualified names. To preserve sanity, we provide limited
backward compatibility for globals that are being widely
used like &quot;sv_undef&quot; and &quot;na&quot; (which
should now be written as &quot;PL_sv_undef&quot;,
&quot;PL_na&quot; etc.)</p>

<p>If you find that your XS extension does not compile
anymore because a perl global is not visible, try adding a
&quot;PL_&quot; prefix to the global and rebuild.</p>

<p>It is strongly recommended that all functions in the
Perl API that don t begin with &quot;perl&quot; be
referenced with a &quot;Perl_&quot; prefix. The bare
function names without the &quot;Perl_&quot; prefix are
supported with macros, but this support may cease in a
future release.</p>

<p>See perlapi.</p>

<p>&middot; Enabling threads has source compatibility
issues</p>

<p>Perl built with threading enabled requires extensions to
use the new &quot;dTHR&quot; macro to initialize the handle
to access per-thread data. If you see a compiler error that
talks about the variable &quot;thr&quot; not being declared
(when building a module that has XS code), you need to add
&quot;dTHR;&quot; at the beginning of the block that
elicited the error.</p>

<p>The API function
&quot;perl_get_sv(&quot;@&quot;,GV_ADD)&quot; should be used
instead of directly accessing perl globals as
&quot;GvSV(errgv)&quot;. The API call is backward compatible
with existing perls and provides source compatibility with
threading is enabled.</p>

<p>See &quot;C Source Compatibility&quot; for more
information.</p>

<p>Binary Compatibility This version is NOT binary
compatible with older versions. All extensions will need to
be recompiled. Further binaries built with threads enabled
are incompatible with binaries built without. This should
largely be transparent to the user, as all binary
incompatible configurations have their own unique
architecture name, and extension binaries get installed at
unique locations. This allows coexistence of several
configurations in the same directory hierarchy. See
INSTALL.</p>

<p>Security fixes may affect compatibility A few taint
leaks and taint omissions have been corrected. This may lead
to &quot;failure&quot; of scripts that used to work with
older versions. Compiling with -DINCOMPLETE_TAINTS provides
a perl with minimal amounts of changes to the tainting
behavior. But note that the resulting perl will have known
insecurities.</p>

<p>Oneliners with the &quot;-e&quot; switch do not create
temporary files anymore.</p>

<p>Relaxed new mandatory warnings introduced in 5.004 Many
new warnings that were introduced in 5.004 have been made
optional. Some of these warnings are still present, but
perls new features make them less often a problem. See
&quot;New Diagnostics&quot;.</p>

<p>Licensing Perl has a new Social Contract for
contributors. See Porting/Contract.</p>

<p>The license included in much of the Perl documentation
has changed. Most of the Perl documentation was previously
under the implicit GNU General Public License or the
Artistic License (at the users choice). Now much of the
documentation unambiguously states the terms under which it
may be distributed. Those terms are in general much less
restrictive than the GNU GPL. See perl and the individual
perl manpages listed therein.</p>

<p>Core Changes Threads WARNING: Threading is considered an
experimental feature. Details of the implementation may
change without notice. There are known limitations and some
bugs. These are expected to be fixed in future versions.</p>

<p>See README.threads.</p>

<p>Compiler WARNING: The Compiler and related tools are
considered experimental. Features may change without notice,
and there are known limitations and bugs. Since the compiler
is fully external to perl, the default configuration will
build and install it.</p>

<p>The Compiler produces three different types of
transformations of a perl program. The C backend generates C
code that captures perls state just before execution begins.
It eliminates the compile-time overheads of the regular perl
interpreter, but the run-time performance remains
comparatively the same. The CC backend generates optimized C
code equivalent to the code path at run-time. The CC backend
has greater potential for big optimizations, but only a few
optimizations are implemented currently. The Bytecode
backend generates a platform independent bytecode
representation of the interpreter s state just before
execution. Thus, the Bytecode back end also eliminates much
of the compilation overhead of the interpreter.</p>

<p>The compiler comes with several valuable utilities.</p>

<p>&quot;B::Lint&quot; is an experimental module to detect
and warn about suspicious code, especially the cases that
the &quot;-w&quot; switch does not detect.</p>

<p>&quot;B::Deparse&quot; can be used to demystify perl
code, and understand how perl optimizes certain
constructs.</p>

<p>&quot;B::Xref&quot; generates cross reference reports of
all definition and use of variables, subroutines and formats
in a program.</p>

<p>&quot;B::Showlex&quot; show the lexical variables used
by a subroutine or file at a glance.</p>

<p>&quot;perlcc&quot; is a simple frontend for compiling
perl.</p>

<p>See &quot;ext/B/README&quot;, B, and the respective
compiler modules.</p>

<p>Regular Expressions Perl s regular expression engine has
been seriously overhauled, and many new constructs are
supported. Several bugs have been fixed.</p>

<p>Here is an itemized summary:</p>

<p>Many new and improved optimizations Changes in the RE
engine:</p>

<p>Unneeded nodes removed; Substrings merged together; New
types of nodes to process (SUBEXPR)* and similar expressions
quickly, used if the SUBEXPR has no side effects and matches
strings of the same length; Better optimizations by lookup
for constant substrings; Better search for constants
substrings anchored by $ ;</p>

<p>Changes in Perl code using RE engine:</p>

<p>More optimizations to s/longer/short/; study() was not
working; /blah/ may be optimized to an analogue of index()
if $&amp; $&lsquo; $&rsquo; not seen; Unneeded copying of
matched-against string removed; Only matched part of the
string is copying if $&lsquo; $&rsquo; were not seen;</p>

<p>Many bug fixes Note that only the major bug fixes are
listed here. See Changes for others.</p>

<p>Backtracking might not restore start of $3. No feedback
if max count for * or + on &quot;complex&quot; subexpression
was reached, similarly (but at compile time) for {3,34567}
Primitive restrictions on max count introduced to decrease a
possibility of a segfault; (ZERO-LENGTH)* could segfault;
(ZERO-LENGTH)* was prohibited; Long REs were not allowed;
/RE/g could skip matches at the same position after a
zero-length match;</p>

<p>New regular expression constructs The following new
syntax elements are supported:</p>

<p>(?&lt;=RE) (?&lt;!RE) (?{ CODE }) (?i-x) (?i:RE)
(?(COND)YES_RE|NO_RE) (?&gt;RE)</p>

<p>New operator for precompiled regular expressions See
&quot;New &quot;qr//&quot; operator&quot;.</p>

<p>Other improvements Better debugging output (possibly
with colors), even from non-debugging Perl; RE engine code
now looks like C, not like assembler; Behaviour of RE
modifiable by &lsquo;use re&rsquo; directive; Improved
documentation; Test suite significantly extended; Syntax
[:^upper:] etc., reserved inside character classes;</p>

<p>Incompatible changes (?i) localized inside enclosing
group; $( is not interpolated into RE any more; /RE/g may
match at the same position (with non-zero length) after a
zero-length match (bug fix).</p>

<p>See perlre and perlop.</p>

<p>Improved malloc() See banner at the beginning of
&quot;malloc.c&quot; for details.</p>

<p>Quicksort is internally implemented Perl now contains
its own highly optimized qsort() routine. The new qsort() is
resistant to inconsistent comparison functions, so Perls
&quot;sort()&quot; will not provoke coredumps any more when
given poorly written sort subroutines. (Some C library
&quot;qsort()&quot;s that were being used before used to
have this problem.) In our testing, the new
&quot;qsort()&quot; required the minimal number of pair-wise
compares on average, among all known &quot;qsort()&quot;
implementations.</p>

<p>See &quot;perlfunc/sort&quot;.</p>

<p>Reliable signals Perl s signal handling is susceptible
to random crashes, because signals arrive asynchronously,
and the Perl runtime is not reentrant at arbitrary
times.</p>

<p>However, one experimental implementation of reliable
signals is available when threads are enabled. See
&quot;Thread::Signal&quot;. Also see INSTALL for how to
build a Perl capable of threads.</p>

<p>Reliable stack pointers The internals now reallocate the
perl stack only at predictable times. In particular, magic
calls never trigger reallocations of the stack, because all
reentrancy of the runtime is handled using a &quot;stack of
stacks&quot;. This should improve reliability of cached
stack pointers in the internals and in XSUBs.</p>

<p>More generous treatment of carriage returns Perl used to
complain if it encountered literal carriage returns in
scripts. Now they are mostly treated like whitespace within
program text. Inside string literals and here documents,
literal carriage returns are ignored if they occur paired
with linefeeds, or get interpreted as whitespace if they
stand alone. This behavior means that literal carriage
returns in files should be avoided. You can get the older,
more compatible (but less generous) behavior by defining the
preprocessor symbol &quot;PERL_STRICT_CR&quot; when building
perl. Of course, all this has nothing whatever to do with
how escapes like&quot; are &quot; handled within
strings.</p>

<p>Note that this doesnt somehow magically allow you to
keep all text files in DOS format. The generous treatment
only applies to files that perl itself parses. If your C
compiler doesn t allow carriage returns in files, you may
still be unable to build modules that need a C compiler.</p>

<p>Memory leaks &quot;substr&quot;, &quot;pos&quot; and
&quot;vec&quot; dont leak memory anymore when used in lvalue
context. Many small leaks that impacted applications that
embed multiple interpreters have been fixed.</p>

<p>Better support for multiple interpreters The build-time
option &quot;-DMULTIPLICITY&quot; has had many of the
details reworked. Some previously global variables that
should have been per- interpreter now are. With care, this
allows interpreters to call each other. See the
&quot;PerlInterp&quot; extension on CPAN.</p>

<p>Behavior of local() on array and hash elements is now
well-defined See &quot;Temporary Values via local()&quot; in
perlsub.</p>

<p>&quot;%!&quot; is transparently tied to the Errno module
See perlvar, and Errno.</p>

<p>Pseudo-hashes are supported See perlref.</p>

<p>&quot;EXPR foreach EXPR&quot; is supported See
perlsyn.</p>

<p>Keywords can be globally overridden See perlsub.</p>

<p>$^E is meaningful on Win32 See perlvar.</p>

<p>&quot;foreach (1..1000000)&quot; optimized &quot;foreach
(1..1000000)&quot; is now optimized into a counting loop. It
does not try to allocate a 1000000-size list anymore.</p>

<p>&quot;Foo::&quot; can be used as implicitly quoted
package name Barewords caused unintuitive behavior when a
subroutine with the same name as a package happened to be
defined. Thus, &quot;new Foo @args&quot;, use the result of
the call to &quot;Foo()&quot; instead of &quot;Foo&quot;
being treated as a literal. The recommended way to write
barewords in the indirect object slot is &quot;new Foo::
@args&quot;. Note that the method &quot;new()&quot; is
called with a first argument of &quot;Foo&quot;, not
&quot;Foo::&quot; when you do that.</p>

<p>&quot;exists $Foo::{Bar::}&quot; tests existence of a
package It was impossible to test for the existence of a
package without actually creating it before. Now
&quot;exists $Foo::{Bar::}&quot; can be used to test if the
&quot;Foo::Bar&quot; namespace has been created.</p>

<p>Better locale support See perllocale.</p>

<p>Experimental support for 64-bit platforms Perl5 has
always had 64-bit support on systems with 64-bit longs.
Starting with 5.005, the beginnings of experimental support
for systems with 32-bit long and 64-bit long long integers
has been added. If you add -DUSE_LONG_LONG to your ccflags
in config.sh (or manually define it in perl.h) then perl
will be built with long long support. There will be many
compiler warnings, and the resultant perl may not work on
all systems. There are many other issues related to third-
party extensions and libraries. This option exists to allow
people to work on those issues.</p>

<p>prototype() returns useful results on builtins See
&quot;prototype&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p>Extended support for exception handling
&quot;die()&quot; now accepts a reference value, and $@ gets
set to that value in exception traps. This makes it possible
to propagate exception objects. This is an undocumented
experimental feature.</p>

<p>Re-blessing in DESTROY() supported for chaining
DESTROY() methods See &quot;Destructors&quot; in
perlobj.</p>

<p>All &quot;printf&quot; format conversions are handled
internally See &quot;printf&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p>New &quot;INIT&quot; keyword &quot;INIT&quot; subs are
like &quot;BEGIN&quot; and &quot;END&quot;, but they get run
just before the perl runtime begins execution. e.g., the
Perl Compiler makes use of &quot;INIT&quot; blocks to
initialize and resolve pointers to XSUBs.</p>

<p>New &quot;lock&quot; keyword The &quot;lock&quot;
keyword is the fundamental synchronization primitive in
threaded perl. When threads are not enabled, it is currently
a noop.</p>

<p>To minimize impact on source compatibility this keyword
is &quot;weak&quot;, i.e., any user-defined subroutine of
the same name overrides it, unless a &quot;use Thread&quot;
has been seen.</p>

<p>New &quot;qr//&quot; operator The &quot;qr//&quot;
operator, which is syntactically similar to the other quote-
like operators, is used to create precompiled regular
expressions. This compiled form can now be explicitly passed
around in variables, and interpolated in other regular
expressions. See perlop.</p>

<p>&quot;our&quot; is now a reserved word Calling a
subroutine with the name &quot;our&quot; will now provoke a
warning when using the &quot;-w&quot; switch.</p>

<p>Tied arrays are now fully supported See Tie::Array.</p>

<p>Tied handles support is better Several missing hooks
have been added. There is also a new base class for TIEARRAY
implementations. See Tie::Array.</p>

<p>4th argument to substr substr() can now both return and
replace in one operation. The optional 4th argument is the
replacement string. See &quot;substr&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p>Negative LENGTH argument to splice splice() with a
negative LENGTH argument now work similar to what the LENGTH
did for substr(). Previously a negative LENGTH was treated
as 0. See &quot;splice&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p>Magic lvalues are now more magical When you say
something like &quot;substr($x, 5) = &quot;hi&quot;&quot;,
the scalar returned by substr() is special, in that any
modifications to it affect $x. (This is called a magic
lvalue because an lvalue is something on the left side of an
assignment.) Normally, this is exactly what you would expect
to happen, but Perl uses the same magic if you use substr(),
pos(), or vec() in a context where they might be modified,
like taking a reference with &quot; modifies @_. In previous
versions, this magic only went one way, but now changes to
the scalar the magic refers to ($x in the above example)
affect the magic lvalue too. For instance, this code now
acts differently:</p>

<p>$x = &quot;hello&quot;; sub printit { $x =
&quot;g&rsquo;bye&quot;; print $_[0], &quot;0; }
printit(substr($x, 0, 5));</p>

<p>In previous versions, this would print
&quot;hello&quot;, but it now prints &quot;gbye&quot;.</p>

<p>&lt;&gt; now reads in records If $/ is a reference to an
integer, or a scalar that holds an integer, &lt;&gt; will
read in records instead of lines. For more info, see
&quot;$/&quot; in perlvar.</p>

<p>Supported Platforms Configure has many incremental
improvements. Site-wide policy for building perl can now be
made persistent, via Policy.sh. Configure also records the
command-line arguments used in config.sh.</p>

<p>New Platforms BeOS is now supported. See
README.beos.</p>

<p>DOS is now supported under the DJGPP tools. See
README.dos (installed as perldos on some systems).</p>

<p>MiNT is now supported. See README.mint.</p>

<p>MPE/iX is now supported. See README.mpeix.</p>

<p>MVS (aka OS390, aka Open Edition) is now supported. See
README.os390 (installed as perlos390 on some systems).</p>

<p>Stratus VOS is now supported. See README.vos.</p>

<p>Changes in existing support Win32 support has been
vastly enhanced. Support for Perl Object, a C++
encapsulation of Perl. GCC and EGCS are now supported on
Win32. See README.win32, aka perlwin32.</p>

<p>VMS configuration system has been rewritten. See
README.vms (installed as README_vms on some systems).</p>

<p>The hints files for most Unix platforms have seen
incremental improvements.</p>

<p>Modules and Pragmata New Modules B Perl compiler and
tools. See B.</p>

<p>Data::Dumper A module to pretty print Perl data. See
Data::Dumper.</p>

<p>Dumpvalue A module to dump perl values to the screen.
See Dumpvalue.</p>

<p>Errno A module to look up errors more conveniently. See
Errno.</p>

<p>File::Spec A portable API for file operations.</p>

<p>ExtUtils::Installed Query and manage installed
modules.</p>

<p>ExtUtils::Packlist Manipulate .packlist files.</p>

<p>Fatal Make functions/builtins succeed or die.</p>

<p>IPC::SysV Constants and other support infrastructure for
System V IPC operations in perl.</p>

<p>Test A framework for writing test suites.</p>

<p>Tie::Array Base class for tied arrays.</p>

<p>Tie::Handle Base class for tied handles.</p>

<p>Thread Perl thread creation, manipulation, and
support.</p>

<p>attrs Set subroutine attributes.</p>

<p>fields Compile-time class fields.</p>

<p>re Various pragmata to control behavior of regular
expressions.</p>

<p>Changes in existing modules Benchmark You can now run
tests for x seconds instead of guessing the right number of
tests to run.</p>

<p>Keeps better time.</p>

<p>Carp Carp has a new function cluck(). cluck() warns,
like carp(), but also adds a stack backtrace to the error
message, like confess().</p>

<p>CGI CGI has been updated to version 2.42.</p>

<p>Fcntl More Fcntl constants added: F_SETLK64, F_SETLKW64,
O_LARGEFILE for large (more than 4G) file access (the 64-bit
support is not yet working, though, so no need to get overly
excited), Free/Net/OpenBSD locking behaviour flags F_FLOCK,
F_POSIX, Linux F_SHLCK, and O_ACCMODE: the mask of O_RDONLY,
O_WRONLY, and O_RDWR.</p>

<p>Math::Complex The accessors methods Re, Im, arg, abs,
rho, theta, methods can ($z-&gt;Re()) now also act as
mutators ($z-&gt;Re(3)).</p>

<p>Math::Trig A little bit of radial trigonometry
(cylindrical and spherical) added, for example the great
circle distance.</p>

<p>POSIX POSIX now has its own platform-specific hints
files.</p>

<p>DB_File DB_File supports version 2.x of Berkeley DB. See
&quot;ext/DB_File/Changes&quot;.</p>

<p>MakeMaker MakeMaker now supports writing empty
makefiles, provides a way to specify that site umask()
policy should be honored. There is also better support for
manipulation of .packlist files, and getting information
about installed modules.</p>

<p>Extensions that have both architecture-dependent and
architecture- independent files are now always installed
completely in the architecture-dependent locations.
Previously, the shareable parts were shared both across
architectures and across perl versions and were therefore
liable to be overwritten with newer versions that might have
subtle incompatibilities.</p>

<p>CPAN See perlmodinstall and CPAN.</p>

<p>Cwd Cwd::cwd is faster on most platforms.</p>

<p>Utility Changes &quot;h2ph&quot; and related utilities
have been vastly overhauled.</p>

<p>&quot;perlcc&quot;, a new experimental front end for the
compiler is available.</p>

<p>The crude GNU &quot;configure&quot; emulator is now
called &quot;configure.gnu&quot; to avoid trampling on
&quot;Configure&quot; under case-insensitive
filesystems.</p>

<p>&quot;perldoc&quot; used to be rather slow. The slower
features are now optional. In particular, case-insensitive
searches need the &quot;-i&quot; switch, and recursive
searches need &quot;-r&quot;. You can set these switches in
the &quot;PERLDOC&quot; environment variable to get the old
behavior.</p>

<p>Documentation Changes Config.pm now has a glossary of
variables.</p>

<p>Porting/patching.pod has detailed instructions on how to
create and submit patches for perl.</p>

<p>perlport specifies guidelines on how to write
portably.</p>

<p>perlmodinstall describes how to fetch and install
modules from &quot;CPAN&quot; sites.</p>

<p>Some more Perl traps are documented now. See
perltrap.</p>

<p>perlopentut gives a tutorial on using open().</p>

<p>perlreftut gives a tutorial on references.</p>

<p>perlthrtut gives a tutorial on threads.</p>

<p>New Diagnostics Ambiguous call resolved as CORE::%s(),
qualify as such or use &amp; (W) A subroutine you have
declared has the same name as a Perl keyword, and you have
used the name without qualification for calling one or the
other. Perl decided to call the builtin because the
subroutine is not imported.</p>

<p>To force interpretation as a subroutine call, either put
an ampersand before the subroutine name, or qualify the name
with its package. Alternatively, you can import the
subroutine (or pretend that its imported with the &quot;use
subs&quot; pragma).</p>

<p>To silently interpret it as the Perl operator, use the
&quot;CORE::&quot; prefix on the operator (e.g.
&quot;CORE::log($x)&quot;) or by declaring the subroutine to
be an object method (see attrs).</p>

<p>Bad index while coercing array into hash (F) The index
looked up in the hash found as the 0 th element of a
pseudo-hash is not legal. Index values must be at 1 or
greater. See perlref.</p>

<p>Bareword &quot;%s&quot; refers to nonexistent package
(W) You used a qualified bareword of the form
&quot;Foo::&quot;, but the compiler saw no other uses of
that namespace before that point. Perhaps you need to
predeclare a package?</p>

<p>Cant call method &quot;%s&quot; on an undefined value
(F) You used the syntax of a method call, but the slot
filled by the object reference or package name contains an
undefined value. Something like this will reproduce the
error:</p>

<p>$BADREF = 42; process $BADREF 1,2,3;
$BADREF-&gt;process(1,2,3);</p>

<p>Cant check filesystem of script &quot;%s&quot; for
nosuid (P) For some reason you cant check the filesystem of
the script for nosuid.</p>

<p>Cant coerce array into hash (F) You used an array where
a hash was expected, but the array has no information on how
to map from keys to array indices. You can do that only with
arrays that have a hash reference at index 0.</p>

<p>Cant goto subroutine from an eval-string (F) The
&quot;goto subroutine&quot; call cant be used to jump out of
an eval &quot;string&quot;. (You can use it to jump out of
an eval {BLOCK}, but you probably dont want to.)</p>

<p>Cant localize pseudo-hash element (F) You said something
like &quot;local $ar-&gt;{&rsquo;key&rsquo;}&quot;, where
$ar is a reference to a pseudo-hash. That hasn t been
implemented yet, but you can get a similar effect by
localizing the corresponding array element directly --
&quot;local
$ar-&gt;[$ar-&gt;[0]{&rsquo;key&rsquo;}]&quot;.</p>

<p>Cant use %%! because Errno.pm is not available (F) The
first time the %! hash is used, perl automatically loads the
Errno.pm module. The Errno module is expected to tie the %!
hash to provide symbolic names for $! errno values.</p>

<p>Cannot find an opnumber for &quot;%s&quot; (F) A string
of a form &quot;CORE::word&quot; was given to prototype(),
but there is no builtin with the name &quot;word&quot;.</p>

<p>Character class syntax [. .] is reserved for future
extensions (W) Within regular expression character classes
([]) the syntax beginning with &quot;[.&quot; and ending
with &quot;.]&quot; is reserved for future extensions. If
you need to represent those character sequences inside a
regular expression character class, just quote the square
brackets with the backslash: &quot;and &quot;.]&quot;.</p>

<p>Character class syntax [: :] is reserved for future
extensions (W) Within regular expression character classes
([]) the syntax beginning with &quot;[:&quot; and ending
with &quot;:]&quot; is reserved for future extensions. If
you need to represent those character sequences inside a
regular expression character class, just quote the square
brackets with the backslash: &quot;and &quot;:]&quot;.</p>

<p>Character class syntax [= =] is reserved for future
extensions (W) Within regular expression character classes
([]) the syntax beginning with &quot;[=&quot; and ending
with &quot;=]&quot; is reserved for future extensions. If
you need to represent those character sequences inside a
regular expression character class, just quote the square
brackets with the backslash: &quot;and &quot;=]&quot;.</p>

<p>%s: Eval-group in insecure regular expression (F) Perl
detected tainted data when trying to compile a regular
expression that contains the &quot;(?{ ... })&quot;
zero-width assertion, which is unsafe. See &quot;(?{ code
})&quot; in perlre, and perlsec.</p>

<p>%s: Eval-group not allowed, use re eval (F) A regular
expression contained the &quot;(?{ ... })&quot; zero-width
assertion, but that construct is only allowed when the
&quot;use re &rsquo;eval&rsquo;&quot; pragma is in effect.
See &quot;(?{ code })&quot; in perlre.</p>

<p>%s: Eval-group not allowed at run time (F) Perl tried to
compile a regular expression containing the &quot;(?{ ...
})&quot; zero-width assertion at run time, as it would when
the pattern contains interpolated values. Since that is a
security risk, it is not allowed. If you insist, you may
still do this by explicitly building the pattern from an
interpolated string at run time and using that in an eval().
See &quot;(?{ code })&quot; in perlre.</p>

<p>Explicit blessing to (assuming package main) (W) You are
blessing a reference to a zero length string. This has the
effect of blessing the reference into the package main. This
is usually not what you want. Consider providing a default
target package, e.g. bless($ref, $p || MyPackage);</p>

<p>Illegal hex digit ignored (W) You may have tried to use
a character other than 0 - 9 or A - F in a hexadecimal
number. Interpretation of the hexadecimal number stopped
before the illegal character.</p>

<p>No such array field (F) You tried to access an array as
a hash, but the field name used is not defined. The hash at
index 0 should map all valid field names to array indices
for that to work.</p>

<p>No such field &quot;%s&quot; in variable %s of type %s
(F) You tried to access a field of a typed variable where
the type does not know about the field name. The field names
are looked up in the %FIELDS hash in the type package at
compile time. The %FIELDS hash is usually set up with the
fields pragma.</p>

<p>Out of memory during ridiculously large request (F) You
cant allocate more than 2^31+&quot;small amount&quot; bytes.
This error is most likely to be caused by a typo in the Perl
program. e.g., $arr[time] instead of $arr[$time].</p>

<p>Range iterator outside integer range (F) One (or both)
of the numeric arguments to the range operator
&quot;..&quot; are outside the range which can be
represented by integers internally. One possible workaround
is to force Perl to use magical string increment by
prepending &quot;0&quot; to your numbers.</p>

<p>Recursive inheritance detected while looking for method
%s %s (F) More than 100 levels of inheritance were
encountered while invoking a method. Probably indicates an
unintended loop in your inheritance hierarchy.</p>

<p>Reference found where even-sized list expected (W) You
gave a single reference where Perl was expecting a list with
an even number of elements (for assignment to a hash). This
usually means that you used the anon hash constructor when
you meant to use parens. In any case, a hash requires
key/value pairs.</p>

<p>%hash = { one =&gt; 1, two =&gt; 2, }; # WRONG %hash = [
qw/ an anon array / ]; # WRONG %hash = ( one =&gt; 1, two
=&gt; 2, ); # right %hash = qw( one 1 two 2 ); # also
fine</p>

<p>Undefined value assigned to typeglob (W) An undefined
value was assigned to a typeglob, a la &quot;*foo =
undef&quot;. This does nothing. Its possible that you really
mean &quot;undef *foo&quot;.</p>

<p>Use of reserved word &quot;%s&quot; is deprecated (D)
The indicated bareword is a reserved word. Future versions
of perl may use it as a keyword, so youre better off either
explicitly quoting the word in a manner appropriate for its
context of use, or using a different name altogether. The
warning can be suppressed for subroutine names by either
adding a &quot;&amp;&quot; prefix, or using a package
qualifier, e.g. &quot;&amp;our()&quot;, or
&quot;Foo::our()&quot;.</p>

<p>perl: warning: Setting locale failed. (S) The whole
warning message will look something like:</p>

<p>perl: warning: Setting locale failed. perl: warning:
Please check that your locale settings: LC_ALL =
&quot;En_US&quot;, LANG = (unset) are supported and
installed on your system. perl: warning: Falling back to the
standard locale (&quot;C&quot;).</p>

<p>Exactly what were the failed locale settings varies. In
the above the settings were that the LC_ALL was
&quot;En_US&quot; and the LANG had no value. This error
means that Perl detected that you and/or your system
administrator have set up the so-called variable system but
Perl could not use those settings. This was not dead
serious, fortunately: there is a &quot;default locale&quot;
called &quot;C&quot; that Perl can and will use, the script
will be run. Before you really fix the problem, however, you
will get the same error message each time you run Perl. How
to really fix the problem can be found in &quot;LOCALE
PROBLEMS&quot; in perllocale.</p>

<p>Obsolete Diagnostics Cant mktemp() (F) The mktemp()
routine failed for some reason while trying to process a -e
switch. Maybe your /tmp partition is full, or clobbered.</p>

<p>Removed because -e doesn t use temporary files any
more.</p>

<p>Cant write to temp file for -e: %s (F) The write routine
failed for some reason while trying to process a -e switch.
Maybe your /tmp partition is full, or clobbered.</p>

<p>Removed because -e doesn t use temporary files any
more.</p>

<p>Cannot open temporary file (F) The create routine failed
for some reason while trying to process a -e switch. Maybe
your /tmp partition is full, or clobbered.</p>

<p>Removed because -e doesn t use temporary files any
more.</p>

<p>regexp too big (F) The current implementation of regular
expressions uses shorts as address offsets within a string.
Unfortunately this means that if the regular expression
compiles to longer than 32767, itll blow up. Usually when
you want a regular expression this big, there is a better
way to do it with multiple statements. See perlre.</p>

<p>Configuration Changes You can use &quot;Configure
-Uinstallusrbinperl&quot; which causes installperl to skip
installing perl also as /usr/bin/perl. This is useful if you
prefer not to modify /usr/bin for some reason or another but
harmful because many scripts assume to find Perl in
/usr/bin/perl.</p>

<p>BUGS If you find what you think is a bug, you might
check the headers of recently posted articles in the
comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup. There may also be information
at http://www.perl.com/perl/ , the Perl Home Page.</p>

<p>If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run
the perlbug program included with your release. Make sure
you trim your bug down to a tiny but sufficient test case.
Your bug report, along with the output of &quot;perl
-V&quot;, will be sent off to &lt;perlbug@perl.com&gt; to be
analysed by the Perl porting team.</p>
