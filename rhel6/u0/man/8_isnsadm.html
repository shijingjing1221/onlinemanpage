<p>NAME isnsadm - iSNS client utility</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS isnsadm [options...] --register object...</p>

<p>isnsadm [...] --query attr[=value]</p>

<p>isnsadm [...] --deregister attr=value</p>

<p>isnsadm [...] --list type attr=value</p>

<p>isnsadm [...] --dd-register attr=value</p>

<p>isnsadm [...] --enroll client-name attr=value</p>

<p>isnsadm [...] --edit-policy attr=value</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Isnsadm is a command line utility for
interacting with an iSNS server. It operates in one of
several modes, which are mutually exclusive. Currently,
isnsadm supports registration, query, and
deregistration.</p>

<p>OPTIONS By default, isnsadm will take most of its
settings from the configura- tion file
/etc/isns/isnsadm.conf, with the exception of the following
options:</p>

<p>--config filename, -c filename This option overrides the
default configuration file.</p>

<p>--debug facility, -d facility enables debugging. Valid
facilities are</p>


<p>+--------+-----------------------------------------------------+
|socket | network send/receive | |auth | authentication and
security related information | |message | iSNS protocol
layer | |state | database state | |scn | SCN (state change
notification) messages | |esi | ESI (entity status inquiry)
messages | |all | all of the above |
+--------+-----------------------------------------------------+</p>

<p>--local makes isnsadm use a Local (aka Unix) socket when
talking to the iSNS server. This can be used by the
administrator to perform management tasks, such as enrolling
new clients, editing access control and so on. Local mode is
only available to the super user.</p>

<p>--control makes isnsadm assume the identity of a control
node. Control nodes are special in that they have more
rights in accessing and modifying the database than normal
storage nodes have.</p>

<p>When using this option, isnsadm will use the source name
and DSA key specified by the Control.SourceName and
Control.AuthKeyFile configura- tion options,
respectively.</p>

<p>--key attr=value This option is recognized in
registration mode only, and lets you specify an object key.
For a more detailed explanation, refer to section
Registration mode.</p>

<p>--keyfile=filename When creating a policy for a new iSNS
client, isnsadm is able to generate a DSA key for the
client. The public part of the key is stored in a policy
object in the iSNS server s database, whereas the private
portion is stored in the file specified by the key- file
option.</p>

<p>--help This will print a help message and exit.</p>

<p>Built-in help Isnsadm has built-in help functions. When
invoked with --help, it will print a general help message
showing all supported command modes, and exit. Specific help
on an individual command mode is available by invoking that
mode with a single argument of help, like this:</p>

<p>isnsadm --register help</p>

<p>This will print a help message describing how to use
this command mode, followed by a list of attributes this
command supports and a help text describing the
attribute.</p>

<p>Supported attributes Most command modes take a list of
attributes as arguments on the com- mand line. The naming
and syntax of these attributes as the same for all commands
modes, however certain modes support only a limited set of
attributes.</p>

<p>Attributes are usually given as name=value pairs. Where
empty (or NIL) attributes are supported, the attribute name
by itself can be given.</p>

<p>The syntax of attribute value depends on the attribute
type. For strings and numeric values, no special conventions
apply, but bitfields have a special syntax described
below.</p>

<p>The attribute name is usually preceded by the object
type it applies to (such as entity), followed by a hyphen
and the name itself. However, where the context clearly
determines a specific object type, the prefix can be
omitted. For instance, when editing a policy object using
--edit-policy, it is acceptable to use node-type as
shorthand for pol- icy-node-type.</p>

<p>Likewise, in a query command, it is not permitted to mix
attributes from different object types. Thus, the first
attribute of a query string establishes a type context, so
that the following two invoca- tions are equivalent:</p>

<p>isnsadm --query pg-name=iqn.com.foo pg-addr=10.1.1.1
pg-port=860/tcp isnsadm --query pg-name=iqn.com.foo
addr=10.1.1.1 port=860/tcp</p>

<p>Isnsadm currently supports the following attributes:</p>

|Network Entity | entity-id 1 eid | | | entity-prot 2 | | |

<p>Portal attributes Portal information is conveyed by two
separate attributes in iSNS; an address attribute holding
the IP address, and a TCP/UDP port attribute holding the
port number and an indication of the protocol to be used
(TCP or UDP).</p>

<p>When parsing a TCP/UDP port, Open-iSNS will expect a
port number, optionally followed by a slash and the
protocol. Port names such as &quot;iscsi-target&quot; are
not supported.</p>

<p>As a convenience, isnsadm supports a notation
representing a portal as one pseudo-attribute. Separating
address and port by a colon. Thus, the following two are
equivalent, with the latter being the shorthand
representation of the former:</p>

<p>addr=&lt;address&gt; port=&lt;port&gt;[/protocol].
portal=&lt;adress&gt;:port[/protocol]</p>

<p>This notation can be used in any context where an
addr/port attribute pair can appear, and may be prefixed by
a type name, as in pg-por- tal=....</p>

<p>When using literal IPv6 addresses, the address has to be
surrounded by square brackets, otherwise the embedded colons
would create ambiguity:
portal=[2001:5c0:0:2::24]:860/tcp</p>

<p>Bitfield attributes Some iSNS attributes are words
representing a bit field. Isnsadm dis- plays and parses
these attributes in human-readable form rather than using
the numerical value. The names of the bit values are
displayed by built-in help facilities. When specifying a
bitfield attribute on the command line, you can combine them
using the plus (+) or comma (,) character, like this:</p>

<p>node-type=control+initiator</p>

<p>Registration mode Registration mode is selected by using
the --register option, followed by a list of one or more
objects to register with the iSNS server. By default, this
will create a network entity for the client (if none
exists), and place the new objects inside it. Usually, you
register all objects for a network entity in one operation,
rather than each one separately.</p>

<p>Each object is specified as a type, optionally followed
by a comma-sep- arated list of attributes, such as this:</p>


<p>target=iqn.2005-01.org.open-iscsi.foo:disk1,alias=disk1</p>

<p>The following object types are currently supported:</p>

<p>entity=name Tells the server to group all objects in the
specified Network Entity container object. Normally, the
iSNS server will auto- matically assign an entity name that
is in line with its poli- cies, and there is no need to
specify it explicitly.</p>

<p>initiator[=name] This will register an iSCSI storage
node of type initiator. By default, the name is set to the
iSNS source name.</p>

<p>This can be followed by any number of iSCSI storage node
attributes.</p>

<p>target[=name] This will register an iSCSI storage node
of type target. By default, the name is set to the iSNS
source name.</p>

<p>This object accepts the same set of attributes as
initiator.</p>

<p>control[=name] This will register an iSCSI storage node
of type control. By default, the name is set to the iSNS
source name. Only manage- ment nodes should be registered as
control nodes, as this gives a node complete control over
the iSNS database.</p>

<p>This object accepts the same set of attributes as
initiator.</p>

<p>portal=[address:port/proto] This will register a portal
using the given address, port and protocol triple. If the
triple is omitted, isnsadm will use the client host s IP
address. If the portal is preceded by an ini- tiator
registration (on the command line), the port defaults to
860/tcp; if it is preceded by a target registration, the
port defaults to 3260/tcp. For multi-homed hosts, the choice
of address is implementation dependant.</p>

<p>This can be followed by any number of portal
attributes.</p>

<p>pg This will register a portal group joining the
preceding portal and node. Portal groups can be used to
describe the preferred portals for a given node; please
refer to RFC 4711 for details.</p>

<p>This can be followed by any number of portal group
attributes. The attribute list must specify a portal group
tag (PGT) via the pgt attribute.</p>

<p>There are two additional command line options of
interest, which are used exclusively with Registration mode.
One is --replace. Normally, registration mode will add new
objects to the network entity associated with the client
host. If you specify --replace on the command line, the
server will wipe the network entity completely, and remove
all portals and storage nodes it contained. Then it will
create a new network entity, and place the portals and
storage nodes provided by the caller inside.</p>

<p>In addition, it is possible to replace just parts of a
network entity. This is achieved by using the command line
option --key to specify the object that should be
replaced.</p>

<p>For instance, assume a network entity contains the
portal 10.1.1.1:860, and the clients network address changed
to 10.2.7.7. Then the follow- ing command will atomically
update the database, replacing just the portal without
touching the registered storage nodes:</p>

<p>isnsadm --replace --key portal=10.1.1.1:860
portal=10.2.7.7:860</p>

<p>The --key option recognizes only a subset of the usual
attributes:</p>

<p>+------------+---------------------+ |Object type |
Syntax | +------------+---------------------+ |Entity |
eid=identifier | |Portal | portal=address:port | |iSCSI Node
| iscsi-name=name | +------------+---------------------+ To
get a list of supported attributes, invoke isnsadm
--register help.</p>

<p>Query mode Query mode is selected by using the --query
option. A query consists of a list of attr=value pairs. All
attributes must belong to the same object type, i.e. queries
that mix a Network Entity attribute with e.g. a Portal
attribute will be rejected.</p>

<p>It is also possible to specify an attribute name without
value (i.e. just attr), which will will match any object
that has such an attribute, regardless of its value. This is
useful when you want to query for all objects of a given
type.</p>

<p>To obtain a list of supported attributes, invoke isnsadm
--query help.</p>

<p>List Mode In this mode, isnsadm will display all objects
of a given type, option- ally restricted to those matching
certain attribute values.</p>

<p>The arguments to list mode are a type name, optionally
followed by one or more attr=value pairs. Only attributes
pertaining to the given type are permitted; for instance, if
you specify a type name of portals, only portal attributes
are permitted.</p>

<p>Possible type names are: entities, nodes, portals, dds,
ddsets, portal- groups, and policies.</p>

<p>Additional information is available via isnsadm --list
help.</p>

<p>Deregistration mode In this mode, you can deregister
objects previously registered. Only the node which
registered an entity in the first place is permitted to
remove it, or any of its child objects. (Control nodes are
not bound by this restriction).</p>

<p>In deregistration mode, the argument list consists of a
list of attr=value pairs. Deregistration supports the same
set of attributes as query mode.</p>

<p>Discovery Domain Registration This mode, allows to
register a discovery domain or to add new members to an
existing discovery domain. Again, attributes are specified
as a list of attr=value pairs. Only discovery domain
attributes are recog- nized.</p>

<p>Note, in order to add members to an existing domain, you
must specify the domains numeric ID. The domains symbolic
name is not a valid han- dle when referring to a discovery
domain.</p>

<p>Client Enrollment This mode only works when the server
recognizes the client as having control node capabilities,
which is possible in two ways:</p>

<p>Invoke isnsadm --local as super user on the host isnsd
is running on. The --local options tells it to communicate
with the server through the local control socket.</p>

<p>Invoke isnsadm --control, which tells it to assume the
identity of a control node. When given this option, isnsadm
will use the source name and DSA key specified by the
Control.SourceName and Control.AuthKeyFile configuration
options, respectively. The server must be configured to
grant this identity control node status.</p>

<p>To enroll a client, use the --enroll option, followed by
the (source) name of the client to enroll. This string will
be used as the name of the security policy the client will
use to identify itself.</p>

<p>This is followed by a list of attribute/value pairs,
where the follow- ing set of attributes is supported:</p>


<p>+------------+---------------------------------------------+
|Attribute | Description Aliases |
+------------+---------------------------------------------+
|name | Policy Name spi | |key | Client s DSA public key |
|entity | Assigned Entity Identifier | |node-type |
Permitted node type(s) | |node-name | Permitted node name(s)
| |functions | Bitmap of permitted functions | |object-type
| Object access mask |
+------------+---------------------------------------------+
The key attribute is used to specify the DSA public key that
the server should use to authenticate messages from this
client. You can either provide a file name; in which case
isnsadm will try to read the PEM encoded public key from
that file. If no key attribute is given, or when using
key=gen, isnsadm will generate a DSA key. The private por-
tion of the newly generated key will be stored in the file
specified by --keyfile=filename.</p>

<p>The object-type attribute is used to specify which
object types the client is permitted to access. This is a
comma separated list of type:perm pairs, where type can be
any of entity, iscsi-node, portal, portal-group, dd, ddset,
and policy. The permissions can be either rw, or r.</p>

<p>The functions attribute can be used to restrict which
functions the client is permitted to invoke. This is a
bitfield, using the standard function names from RFC 4171,
such as DevAttrReg, DevAttrQry, etc.</p>

<p>For a description of the open-isns security model and
policies, please refer to the isns_config(5) manual
page.</p>

<p>Important note: In order to generate a DSA key, you have
to have a set of DSA parameters installed. By default,
isnsadm expects to find them in /etc/isns/dsa.params. These
parameters are created by calling isnsd --init once on the
server machine. Alternatively, you can use the fol- lowing
command:</p>

<p>openssl dsaparam 1024 -out /etc/isns/dsa.params</p>

<p>where 1024 is the chosen DSA key size, in bits.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES If you want to use Open-iSNS in authenticated
mode, you first need to initialize the servers DSA key and
DSA parameters. This can be done conveniently by using</p>

<p>isnsd --init</p>

<p>This will create the servers private and public key, and
place them in /etc/isns/auth_key and auth_key.pub,
respectively.</p>

<p>The following command will create a policy object for a
node named isns.control , and grant it control
privileges:</p>

<p>isnsadm --local --keyfile=control.key --enroll
isns.control node-type=ALL functions=ALL object-type=ALL</p>

<p>In the process of entrolling the client, this will
generate a DSA key pair, and place the private key portion
in the file control.key. This file must be installed as
/etc/isns/control.key on the host you wish to use as an iSNS
management station.</p>

<p>Next, you need to create a storage node object for the
management sta- tion:</p>

<p>isnsadm --local --register control</p>

<p>On the management station, you can then enroll
additional hosts:</p>

<p>isnsadm --control --keyfile=somehost.key --enroll
iqn.2005-01.org.open- iscsi.somehost
node-type=target+initiator</p>

<p>Again, this will generate a DSA key pair and store the
private key por- tion in auth_key. Note the use of the
--control option that tells isnsadm to use the identity of
the control node instead of the default key and source
name.</p>

<p>You then need to copy somehost.key to the client host
and install it as /etc/isns/auth_key. Likewise, the server s
public key (which resides in /etc/isns/auth_key.pub on the
server) needs to be copied to the client machine, and placed
in /etc/isns/server_key.pub.</p>

<p>By default, when a client registers a storage node (be
it initiator or target) with iSNS, the client will not be
able to see any other storage nodes. In order for targets to
be visible to a given initiator, you need to create
so-called Discovery Domains (or DDs for short).</p>

<p>Currently, domain membership operations require
administrator privi- lege. Future extensions may allow iSNS
clients to add themselves to one or more DDs upon
registration.</p>

<p>To create a discovery domain, and add nodes to it, you
can use</p>

<p>isnsadm --control --dd-register dd-name=mydomain
member-name=iqn.org.bozo.client iqn.org.bozo.jbod ...</p>

<p>In order to add members to an existing DD, you have to
specify the numeric domain ID - using the DD name is not
sufficient, unfortunately (this is a requirement of the RFC,
not an implementation issue):</p>

<p>isnsadm --control --dd-register dd-id=42
member-name=iqn.com.foo member-name=iqn.com.bar</p>

<p>The DD ID can be obtained by doing a query for the DD
name:</p>

<p>isnsadm --control --query dd-name=mydomain</p>

<p>In management mode, you can also register and deregister
nodes and por- tals manually, in case you want to fix up an
inconsisteny in the database. For instance, this will
register a node and portal on a host named
client.bozo.org:</p>

<p>isnsadm --control --register entity=client.bozo.org
initiator=iqn.org.bozo.client portal=191.168.7.1:860</p>

<p>Note that this registration explicitly specifies the
network entity in which to place the new objects. If you
omit this, the new objects will be placed in an entity named
CONTROL, which is decidedly not what you want.</p>
