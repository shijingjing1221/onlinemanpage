<p>Minimum unique abbreviation of option is acceptable. You
may use dou- ble hyphens instead of single hyphen to denote
options. You may use white space in place of the equals sign
to separate an option name from its value.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pamscale scales a Netpbm image by a specified factor, or
scales indi- vidually horizontally and vertically by
specified factors.</p>

<p>You can either enlarge (scale factor &gt; 1) or reduce
(scale factor &lt; 1).</p>

<p>The Scale Factors The options -width, -height, -xsize,
-ysize, -xscale, -yscale, -xyfit, -xyfill, -reduce, and
-pixels control the amount of scaling. For back- ward
compatibility, there is also -xysize and the scale_factor
argu- ment, but you shouldnt use those.</p>

<p>-width and -height specify the width and height in
pixels you want the resulting image to be. See below for
rules when you specify one and not the other.</p>

<p>-xsize and -ysize are synonyms for -width and -height,
respectively.</p>

<p>-xscale and -yscale tell the factor by which you want
the width and height of the image to change from source to
result (e.g. -xscale 2 means you want to double the width;
-xscale .5 means you want to halve it). See below for rules
when you specify one and not the other.</p>

<p>When you specify an absolute size or scale factor for
both dimensions, pamscale scales each dimension
independently without consideration of the aspect ratio.</p>

<p>If you specify one dimension as a pixel size and don t
specify the other dimension, pamscale scales the unspecified
dimension to preserve the aspect ratio.</p>

<p>If you specify one dimension as a scale factor and don t
specify the other dimension, pamscale leaves the unspecified
dimension unchanged from the input.</p>

<p>If you specify the scale_factor parameter instead of
dimension options, that is the scale factor for both
dimensions. It is equivalent to -xscale=scale_factor
-yscale=scale_factor.</p>

<p>Specifying the -reduce reduction_factor option is
equivalent to speci- fying the scale_factor parameter, where
scale_factor is the reciprocal of reduction_factor.</p>

<p>-xyfit specifies a bounding box. pamscale scales the
input image to the largest size that fits within the box,
while preserving its aspect ratio. -xysize is a synonym for
this. Before Netpbm 10.20 (January 2004), -xyfit did not
exist, but -xysize did.</p>

<p>-xyfill is similar, but pamscale scales the input image
to the smallest size that completely fills the box, while
preserving its aspect ratio. This option has existed since
Netpbm 10.20 (January 2004).</p>

<p>-pixels specifies a maximum total number of output
pixels. pamscale scales the image down to that number of
pixels. If the input image is already no more than that many
pixels, pamscale just copies it as out- put; pamscale does
not scale up with -pixels.</p>

<p>If you enlarge by a factor of 3 or more, you should
probably add a pnmsmooth step; otherwise, you can see the
original pixels in the resulting image.</p>

<p>Usage Notes A useful application of pamscale is to blur
an image. Scale it down (without -nomix) to discard some
information, then scale it back up using pamstretch.</p>

<p>Or scale it back up with pamscale and create a pixelized
image, which is sort of a computer-age version of
blurring.</p>

<p>Transparency pamscale understands transparency and
properly mixes pixels considering the pixels
transparency.</p>

<p>Proper mixing does not mean just mixing the transparency
value and the color component values separately. In a PAM
image, a pixel which is not opaque represents a color that
contains light of the foreground color indicated explicitly
in the PAM and light of a background color to be named
later. But the numerical scale of a color component sample
in a PAM is as if the pixel is opaque. So a pixel that is
supposed to contain half-strength red light for the
foreground plus some light from the background has a red
color sample that says full red and a trans- parency sample
that says 50% opaque. In order to mix pixels, you have to
first convert the color sample values to numbers that
represent amount of light directly (i.e. multiply by the
opaqueness) and after mixing, convert back (divide by the
opaqueness).</p>

<p>Input And Output Image Types pamscale produces output of
the same type (and tuple type if the type is PAM) as the
input, except if the input is PBM. In that case, the output
is PGM with maxval 255. The purpose of this is to allow
mean- ingful pixel mixing. Note that there is no equivalent
exception when the input is PAM. If the PAM input tuple type
is BLACKANDWHITE, the PAM output tuple type is also
BLACKANDWHITE, and you get no meaningful pixel mixing.</p>

<p>If you want PBM output with PBM input, use pamditherbw
to convert pam- scales output to PBM. Also consider
pbmreduce.</p>

<p>pamscale s function is essentially undefined for PAM
input images that are not of tuple type RGB, GRAYSCALE,
BLACKANDWHITE, or the _ALPHA variations of those. (By
standard Netpbm backward compatibility, this includes PBM,
PGM, and PPM images).</p>

<p>You might think it would have an obvious effect on other
tuple types, but remember that the aforementioned tuple
types have gamma-adjusted sample values, and pamscale uses
that fact in its calculations. And it treats a transparency
plane different from any other plane.</p>

<p>pamscale does not simply reject unrecognized tuple types
because there s a possibility that just by coincidence you
can get useful func- tion out of it with some other tuple
type and the right combination of options (consider -linear
in particular).</p>

<p>Methods Of Scaling There are numerous ways to scale an
image. pamscale implements a bunch of them; you select among
them with invocation options.</p>

<p>Pixel Mixing</p>

<p>Pamscales default method is pixel mixing. To understand
this, imagine the source image as composed of square tiles.
Each tile is a pixel and has uniform color. The tiles are
all the same size. Now take a trans- parent sheet the size
of the target image, marked with a square grid of tiles the
same size. Stretch or compress the source image to the size
of the sheet and lay the sheet over the source.</p>

<p>Each cell in the overlay grid stands for a pixel of the
target image. For example, if you are scaling a 100x200
image up by 1.5, the source image is 100 x 200 tiles, and
the transparent sheet is marked off in 150 x 300 cells.</p>

<p>Each cell covers parts of multiple tiles. To make the
target image, just color in each cell with the color which
is the average of the col- ors the cell covers -- weighted
by the amount of that color it covers. A cell in our example
might cover 4/9 of a blue tile, 2/9 of a red tile, 2/9 of a
green tile, and 1/9 of a white tile. So the target pixel
would be somewhat unsaturated blue.</p>

<p>When you are scaling up or down by an integer, the
results are simple. When scaling up, pixels get duplicated.
When scaling down, pixels get thrown away. In either case,
the colors in the target image are a sub- set of those in
the source image.</p>

<p>When the scale factor is weirder than that, the target
image can have colors that didnt exist in the original. For
example, a red pixel next to a white pixel in the source
might become a red pixel, a pink pixel, and a white pixel in
the target.</p>

<p>This method tends to replicate what the human eye does
as it moves closer to or further away from an image. It also
tends to replicate what the human eye sees, when far enough
away to make the pixelization disappear, if an image is not
made of pixels and simply stretches or shrinks.</p>

<p>Discrete Sampling</p>

<p>Discrete sampling is basically the same thing as pixel
mixing except that, in the model described above, instead of
averaging the colors of the tiles the cell covers, you pick
the one color that covers the most area.</p>

<p>The result you see is that when you enlarge an image,
pixels get dupli- cated and when you reduce an image, some
pixels get discarded.</p>

<p>The advantage of this is that you end up with an image
made from the same color palette as the original. Sometimes
thats important.</p>

<p>The disadvantage is that it distorts the picture. If you
scale up by 1.5 horizontally, for example, the even numbered
input pixels are dou- bled in the output and the odd
numbered ones are copied singly. If you have a bunch of one
pixel wide lines in the source, you may find that some of
them stretch to 2 pixels, others remain 1 pixel when you
enlarge. When you reduce, you may find that some of the
lines disap- pear completely.</p>

<p>You select discrete sampling with pamscales -nomix
option.</p>

<p>Actually, -nomix doesn t do exactly what I described
above. It does the scaling in two passes - first horizontal,
then vertical. This can produce slightly different
results.</p>

<p>There is one common case in which one often finds it
burdensome to have pamscale make up colors that werent there
originally: Where one is working with an image format such
as GIF that has a limited number of possible colors per
image. If you take a GIF with 256 colors, convert it to PPM,
scale by .625, and convert back to GIF, you will probably
find that the reduced image has way more than 256 colors,
and therefore cannot be converted to GIF. One way to solve
this problem is to do the reduction with discrete sampling
instead of pixel mixing. Probably a better way is to do the
pixel mixing, but then color quantize the result with
pnmquant before converting to GIF.</p>

<p>When the scale factor is an integer (which means you re
scaling up), discrete sampling and pixel mixing are
identical -- output pixels are always just N copies of the
input pixels. In this case, though, con- sider using
pamstretch instead of pamscale to get the added pixels
interpolated instead of just copied and thereby get a
smoother enlarge- ment.</p>

<p>pamscale s discrete sampling is faster than pixel
mixing, but pamen- large is faster still. pamenlarge works
only on integer enlargements.</p>

<p>discrete sampling (-nomix) was new in Netpbm 9.24
(January 2002).</p>

<p>Resampling</p>

<p>Resampling assumes that the source image is a discrete
sampling of some original continuous image. That is, it
assumes there is some non-pix- elized original image and
each pixel of the source image is simply the color of that
image at a particular point. Those points, naturally, are
the intersections of a square grid.</p>

<p>The idea of resampling is just to compute that original
image, then sample it at a different frequency (a grid of a
different scale).</p>

<p>The problem, of course, is that sampling necessarily
throws away the information you need to rebuild the original
image. So we have to make a bunch of assumptions about the
makeup of the original image.</p>

<p>You tell pamscale to use the resampling method by
specifying the -fil- ter option. The value of this option is
the name of a function, from the set listed below.</p>

<p>To explain resampling, we are going to talk about a
simple one dimen- sional scaling -- scaling a single row of
grayscale pixels horizon- tally. If you can understand that,
you can easily understand how to do a whole image: Scale
each of the rows of the image, then scale each of the
resulting columns. And scale each of the color component
planes separately.</p>

<p>As a first step in resampling, pamscale converts the
source image, which is a set of discrete pixel values, into
a continuous step func- tion. A step function is a function
whose graph is a staircase-y thing.</p>

<p>Now, we convolve the step function with a proper scaling
of the filter function that you identified with -filter. If
you don t know what the mathematical concept of convolution
(convolving) is, you are officially lost. You cannot
understand this explanation. The result of this con-
volution is the imaginary original continuous image weve
been talking about.</p>

<p>Finally, we make target pixels by picking values from
that function.</p>

<p>To understand what is going on, we use Fourier
analysis:</p>

<p>The idea is that the only difference between our step
function and the original continuous function (remember that
we constructed the step function from the source image,
which is itself a sampling of the orig- inal continuous
function) is that the step function has a bunch of high
frequency Fourier components added. If we could chop out all
the higher frequency components of the step function, and
know that theyre all higher than any frequency in the
original function, we d have the original function back.</p>

<p>The resampling method assumes that the original function
was sampled at a high enough frequency to form a perfect
sampling. A perfect sampling is one from which you can
recover exactly the original continuous func- tion. The
Nyquist theorem says that as long as your sample rate is at
least twice the highest frequency in your original function,
the sam- pling is perfect. So we assume that the image is a
sampling of some- thing whose highest frequency is half the
sample rate (pixel resolu- tion) or less. Given that, our
filtering does in fact recover the original continuous image
from the samples (pixels).</p>

<p>To chop out all the components above a certain
frequency, we just mul- tiply the Fourier transform of the
step function by a rectangle func- tion.</p>

<p>We could find the Fourier transform of the step
function, multiply it by a rectangle function, and then
Fourier transform the result back, but theres an easier way.
Mathematicians tell us that multiplying in the frequency
domain is equivalent to convolving in the time domain. That
means multiplying the Fourier transform of F by a rectangle
func- tion R is the same as convolving F with the Fourier
transform of R. Its a lot better to take the Fourier
transform of R, and build it into pamscale than to have
pamscale take the Fourier transform of the input image
dynamically.</p>

<p>That leaves only one question: What is the Fourier
transform of a rectangle function? Answer: sinc. Recall from
math that sinc is defined as sinc(x) = sin(PI*x)/PI*x.</p>

<p>Hence, when you specify -filter=sinc, you are
effectively passing the step function of the source image
through a low pass frequency filter and recovering a good
approximation of the original continuous image.</p>

<p>Refiltering</p>

<p>There s another twist: If you simply sample the
reconstructed original continuous image at the new sample
rate, and that new sample rate isnt at least twice the
highest frequency in the original continuous image, you wont
get a perfect sampling. In fact, you ll get something with
ugly aliasing in it. Note that this cant be a problem when
youre scaling up (increasing the sample rate), because the
fact that the old sample rate was above the Nyquist level
means so is the new one. But when scaling down, its a
problem. Obviously, you have to give up image quality when
scaling down, but aliasing is not the best way to do it. It
s better just to remove high frequency components from the
original continuous image before sampling, and then get a
perfect sam- pling of that.</p>

<p>Therefore, pamscale filters out frequencies above half
the new sample rate before picking the new samples.</p>

<p>Approximations</p>

<p>Unfortunately, pamscale doesn t do the convolution
precisely. Instead of evaluating the filter function at
every point, it samples it -- assumes that it doesnt change
any more often than the step function does. pamscale could
actually do the true integration fairly easily. Since the
filter functions are built into the program, the integrals
of them could be too. Maybe someday it will.</p>

<p>There is one more complication with the Fourier
analysis. sinc has nonzero values on out to infinity and
minus infinity. That makes it hard to compute a convolution
with it. So instead, there are filter functions that
approximate sinc but are nonzero only within a manage- able
range. To get those, you multiply the sinc function by a
window function, which you select with the -window option.
The same holds for other filter functions that go on forever
like sinc. By default, for a filter that needs a window
function, the window function is the Black- man
function.</p>

<p>Filter Functions Besides Sinc</p>

<p>The math described above works only with sinc as the
filter function. pamscale offers many other filter
functions, though. Some of these approximate sinc and are
faster to compute. For most of them, I have no idea of the
mathematical explanation for them, but people do find they
give pleasing results. They may not be based on resampling
at all, but just exploit the convolution that is
coincidentally part of a resampling calculation.</p>

<p>For some filter functions, you can tell just by looking
at the convolu- tion how they vary the resampling process
from the perfect one based on sinc:</p>

<p>The impulse filter assumes that the original continuous
image is in fact a step function -- the very one we computed
as the first step in the resampling. This is mathematically
equivalent to the discrete sam- pling method.</p>

<p>The box (rectangle) filter assumes the original image is
a piecewise linear function. Its graph just looks like
straight lines connecting the pixel values. This is
mathematically equivalent to the pixel mixing method (but
mixing brightness, not light intensity, so like pam- scale
-linear) when scaling down, and interpolation (ala
pamstretch) when scaling up.</p>

<p>Gamma</p>

<p>pamscale assumes the underlying continuous function is a
function of brightness (as opposed to light intensity), and
therefore does all this math using the gamma-adjusted
numbers found in a PNM or PAM image. The -linear option is
not available with resampling (it causes pamscale to fail),
because it wouldnt be useful enough to justify the
implementa- tion effort.</p>

<p>Resampling (-filter) was new in Netpbm 10.20 (January
2004).</p>

<p>The filter functions</p>

<p>Here is a list of the function names you can specify for
the -filter option. For most of them, youre on your own to
figure out just what the function is and what kind of
scaling it does. These are common functions from
mathematics.</p>

<p>point The graph of this is a single point at X=0,
Y=1.</p>

<p>box The graph of this is a rectangle sitting on the X
axis and cen- tered on the Y axis with height 1 and base
1.</p>

<p>triangle The graph of this is an isosceles triangle
sitting on the X axis and centered on the Y axis with height
1 and base 2.</p>

<p>Linear vs Gamma-adjusted The pixel mixing scaling method
described above involves intensities of pixels (more
precisely, it involves individual intensities of primary
color components of pixels). But the PNM and PNM-equivalent
PAM image formats represent intensities with gamma-adjusted
numbers that are not linearly proportional to intensity. So
pamscale, by default, performs a calculation on each sample
read from its input and each sample writ- ten to its output
to convert between these gamma-adjusted numbers and internal
intensity-proportional numbers.</p>

<p>Sometimes you are not working with true PNM or PAM
images, but rather a variation in which the sample values
are in fact directly proportional to intensity. If so, use
the -linear option to tell pamscale this. pamscale then will
skip the conversions.</p>

<p>The conversion takes time. In one experiment, it
increased by a factor of 10 the time required to reduce an
image. And the difference between intensity-proportional
values and gamma-adjusted values may be small enough that
you would barely see a difference in the result if you just
pretended that the gamma-adjusted values were in fact
intensity-propor- tional. So just to save time, at the
expense of some image quality, you can specify -linear even
when you have true PPM input and expect true PPM output.</p>

<p>For the first 13 years of Netpbms life, until Netpbm
10.20 (January 2004), pamscales predecessor pnmscale always
treated the PPM samples as intensity-proportional even
though they were not, and drew few com- plaints. So using
-linear as a lie is a reasonable thing to do if speed is
important to you. But if speed is important, you also should
consider the -nomix option and pnmscalefixed.</p>

<p>Another technique to consider is to convert your PNM
image to the lin- ear variation with pnmgamma, run pamscale
on it and other transforma- tions that like linear PNM, and
then convert it back to true PNM with pnmgamma -ungamma.
pnmgamma is often faster than pamscale in doing the
conversion.</p>

<p>With -nomix, -linear has no effect. That s because
pamscale does not concern itself with the meaning of the
sample values in this method; pamscale just copies numbers
from its input to its output.</p>

<p>Precision pamscale uses floating point arithmetic
internally. There is a speed cost associated with this. For
some images, you can get the acceptable results (in fact,
sometimes identical results) faster with pnmscale- fixed,
which uses fixed point arithmetic. pnmscalefixed may,
however, distort your image a little. See the pnmscalefixed
user manual for a complete discussion of the difference.</p>

pam(1)</p>

<p>HISTORY pamscale was new in Netpbm 10.20 (January 2004).
It was adapted from, and obsoleted, pnmscale. pamscale s
primary difference from pnmscale is that it handles the PAM
format and uses the &quot;pam&quot; facilities of the Netpbm
programming library. But it also added the resampling class
of scaling method. Furthermore, it properly does its pixel
mixing arithmetic (by default) using intensity-proportional
values instead of the gamma-adjusted values the pnmscale
uses. To get the old pnmscale arithmetic, you can specify
the -linear option.</p>

<p>The intensity proportional stuff came out of suggestions
by Adam M Costello in January 2004.</p>

<p>The resampling algorithms are mostly taken from code
contributed by Michael Reinelt in December 2003.</p>

<p>The version of pnmscale from which pamscale was derived,
itself evolved out of the original Pbmplus version of
pnmscale by Jef Poskanzer (1989, 1991). But none of that
original code remains.</p>
