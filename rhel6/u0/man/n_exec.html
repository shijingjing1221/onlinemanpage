<p>NAME exec - Invoke subprocesses</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS exec ?switches? arg ?arg ...?
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This command treats its arguments as the
specification of one or more subprocesses to execute. The
arguments take the form of a standard shell pipeline where
each arg becomes one word of a command, and each distinct
command becomes a subprocess.</p>

<p>If the initial arguments to exec start with - then they
are treated as command-line switches and are not part of the
pipeline specification. The following switches are currently
supported:</p>

<p>-ignorestderr Stops the exec command from treating the
output of mes- sages to the pipelines standard error channel
as an error case.</p>

<p>-keepnewline Retains a trailing newline in the pipeline
s output. Nor- mally a trailing newline will be deleted.</p>

<p>-- Marks the end of switches. The argument following
this one will be treated as the first arg even if it starts
with a -.</p>

<p>If an arg (or pair of args) has one of the forms
described below then it is used by exec to control the flow
of input and output among the subprocess(es). Such arguments
will not be passed to the subpro- cess(es). In forms such as
&lt; fileName , fileName may either be in a separate
argument from &lt; or in the same argument with no
intervening space (i.e. &lt;fileName).</p>

<p>| Separates distinct commands in the pipeline. The stan-
dard output of the preceding command will be piped into the
standard input of the next command.</p>

<p>|&amp; Separates distinct commands in the pipeline. Both
stan- dard output and standard error of the preceding
command will be piped into the standard input of the next
com- mand. This form of redirection overrides forms such as
2&gt; and &gt;&amp;.</p>

<p>&lt; fileName The file named by fileName is opened and
used as the standard input for the first command in the
pipeline.</p>

<p>&lt;@ fileId FileId must be the identifier for an open
file, such as the return value from a previous call to open.
It is used as the standard input for the first command in
the pipeline. FileId must have been opened for reading.</p>

<p>&lt;&lt; value Value is passed to the first command as
its standard input.</p>

<p>&gt; fileName Standard output from the last command is
redirected to the file named fileName, overwriting its
previous contents.</p>

<p>2&gt; fileName Standard error from all commands in the
pipeline is redirected to the file named fileName,
overwriting its previous contents.</p>

<p>&gt;&amp; fileName Both standard output from the last
command and standard error from all commands are redirected
to the file named fileName, overwriting its previous
contents.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; fileName Standard output from the last command
is redirected to the file named fileName, appending to it
rather than overwriting it.</p>

<p>2&gt;&gt; fileName Standard error from all commands in
the pipeline is redirected to the file named fileName,
appending to it rather than overwriting it.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt;&amp; fileName Both standard output from the
last command and standard error from all commands are
redirected to the file named fileName, appending to it
rather than overwriting it.</p>

<p>&gt;@ fileId FileId must be the identifier for an open
file, such as the return value from a previous call to open.
Standard output from the last command is redirected to
fileIds file, which must have been opened for writing.</p>

<p>2&gt;@ fileId FileId must be the identifier for an open
file, such as the return value from a previous call to open.
Standard error from all commands in the pipeline is
redirected to fileIds file. The file must have been opened
for writ- ing.</p>

<p>2&gt;@1 Standard error from all commands in the pipeline
is redirected to the command result. This operator is only
valid at the end of the command pipeline.</p>

<p>&gt;&amp;@ fileId FileId must be the identifier for an
open file, such as the return value from a previous call to
open. Both standard output from the last command and
standard error from all commands are redirected to fileId s
file. The file must have been opened for writing.</p>

<p>If standard output has not been redirected then the exec
command returns the standard output from the last command in
the pipeline, unless 2&gt;@1 was specified, in which case
standard error is included as well. If any of the commands
in the pipeline exit abnormally or are killed or suspended,
then exec will return an error and the error mes- sage will
include the pipelines output followed by error messages
describing the abnormal terminations; the -errorcode return
option will contain additional information about the last
abnormal termination encountered. If any of the commands
writes to its standard error file and that standard error is
not redirected and -ignorestderr is not specified, then exec
will return an error; the error message will include the
pipelines standard output, followed by messages about
abnormal terminations (if any), followed by the standard
error output.</p>

<p>If the last character of the result or error message is
a newline then that character is normally deleted from the
result or error message. This is consistent with other Tcl
return values, which do not normally end with newlines.
However, if -keepnewline is specified then the trailing
newline is retained.</p>

<p>If standard input is not redirected with &lt;, &lt;&lt;
or &lt;@ then the standard input for the first command in
the pipeline is taken from the applications current standard
input.</p>

<p>If the last arg is &amp; then the pipeline will be
executed in back- ground. In this case the exec command will
return a list whose ele- ments are the process identifiers
for all of the subprocesses in the pipeline. The standard
output from the last command in the pipeline will go to the
applications standard output if it has not been redi-
rected, and error output from all of the commands in the
pipeline will go to the application s standard error file
unless redirected.</p>

<p>The first word in each command is taken as the command
name; tilde-sub- stitution is performed on it, and if the
result contains no slashes then the directories in the PATH
environment variable are searched for an executable by the
given name. If the name contains a slash then it must refer
to an executable reachable from the current directory. No
glob expansion or other shell-like substitutions are
performed on the arguments to commands.</p>

<p>PORTABILITY ISSUES Windows (all versions) Reading from
or writing to a socket, using the @ fileId nota- tion, does
not work. When reading from a socket, a 16-bit DOS
application will hang and a 32-bit application will return
imme- diately with end-of-file. When either type of
application writes to a socket, the information is instead
sent to the con- sole, if one is present, or is
discarded.</p>

<p>The Tk console text widget does not provide real
standard IO capabilities. Under Tk, when redirecting from
standard input, all applications will see an immediate
end-of-file; information redirected to standard output or
standard error will be dis- carded.</p>

<p>Either forward or backward slashes are accepted as path
separa- tors for arguments to Tcl commands. When executing
an applica- tion, the path name specified for the
application may also con- tain forward or backward slashes
as path separators. Bear in mind, however, that most Windows
applications accept arguments with forward slashes only as
option delimiters and backslashes only in paths. Any
arguments to an application that specify a path name with
forward slashes will not automatically be con- verted to use
the backslash character. If an argument contains forward
slashes as the path separator, it may or may not be rec-
ognized as a path name, depending on the program.</p>

<p>Additionally, when calling a 16-bit DOS or Windows 3.X
applica- tion, all path names must use the short, cryptic,
path format (e.g., using applba~1.def instead of
applbakery.default), which can be obtained with the file
attributes fileName -short- name command.</p>

<p>Two or more forward or backward slashes in a row in a
path refer to a network path. For example, a simple
concatenation of the root directory c:/ with a subdirectory
/windows/system will yield c://windows/system (two slashes
together), which refers to the mount point called system on
the machine called windows (and the c:/ is ignored), and is
not equivalent to c:/windows/system, which describes a
directory on the current computer. The file join command
should be used to concatenate path components.</p>

<p>Note that there are two general types of Win32 console
applica- tions:</p>

<p>[1] CLI CommandLine Interface, simple stdio exchange.
netstat.exe for example.</p>

<p>[2] TUI Textmode User Interface, any application that
accesses the console API for doing such things as cursor
movement, setting text color, detecting key presses and
mouse movement, etc. An example would be telnet.exe from
Windows 2000. These types of applications are not common in
a windows environment, but do exist.</p>

<p>exec will not work well with TUI applications when a
console is not present, as is done when launching
applications under wish. It is desirable to have console
applications hidden and detached. This is a designed-in
limitation as exec wants to communicate over pipes. The
Expect extension addresses this issue when communicating
with a TUI application.</p>

<p>Windows NT When attempting to execute an application,
exec first searches for the name as it was specified. Then,
in order, .com, .exe, and .bat are appended to the end of
the specified name and it searches for the longer name. If a
directory name was not spec- ified as part of the
application name, the following directories are
automatically searched in order when attempting to locate
the application:</p>

<p>&middot; The directory from which the Tcl executable was
loaded.</p>

<p>&middot; The current directory.</p>

<p>&middot; The Windows NT 32-bit system directory.</p>

<p>&middot; The Windows NT 16-bit system directory.</p>

<p>&middot; The Windows NT home directory.</p>

<p>&middot; The directories listed in the path.</p>

<p>In order to execute shell built-in commands like dir and
copy, the caller must prepend the desired command with
cmd.exe /c because built-in commands are not implemented
using executables.</p>

<p>Windows 9x When attempting to execute an application,
exec first searches for the name as it was specified. Then,
in order, .com, .exe, and .bat are appended to the end of
the specified name and it searches for the longer name. If a
directory name was not spec- ified as part of the
application name, the following directories are
automatically searched in order when attempting to locate
the application:</p>

<p>&middot; The directory from which the Tcl executable was
loaded.</p>

<p>&middot; The current directory.</p>

<p>&middot; The Windows 9x system directory.</p>

<p>&middot; The Windows 9x home directory.</p>

<p>&middot; The directories listed in the path.</p>

<p>In order to execute shell built-in commands like dir and
copy, the caller must prepend the desired command with
command.com /c because built-in commands are not implemented
using exe- cutables.</p>

<p>Once a 16-bit DOS application has read standard input
from a console and then quit, all subsequently run 16-bit
DOS applica- tions will see the standard input as already
closed. 32-bit applications do not have this problem and
will run correctly, even after a 16-bit DOS application
thinks that standard input is closed. There is no known
workaround for this bug at this time.</p>

<p>Redirection between the NUL: device and a 16-bit
application does not always work. When redirecting from
NUL:, some applica- tions may hang, others will get an
infinite stream of 0x01 bytes, and some will actually
correctly get an immediate end-of- file; the behavior seems
to depend upon something compiled into the application
itself. When redirecting greater than 4K or so to NUL:, some
applications will hang. The above problems do not happen
with 32-bit applications.</p>

<p>All DOS 16-bit applications are run synchronously. All
standard input from a pipe to a 16-bit DOS application is
collected into a temporary file; the other end of the pipe
must be closed before the 16-bit DOS application begins
executing. All stan- dard output or error from a 16-bit DOS
application to a pipe is collected into temporary files; the
application must terminate before the temporary files are
redirected to the next stage of the pipeline. This is due to
a workaround for a Windows 95 bug in the implementation of
pipes, and is how the standard Windows 95 DOS shell handles
pipes itself.</p>

<p>Certain applications, such as command.com, should not be
exe- cuted interactively. Applications which directly access
the console window, rather than reading from their standard
input and writing to their standard output may fail, hang
Tcl, or even hang the system if their own private console
window is not available to them.</p>

<p>Unix The exec command is fully functional and works as
described.</p>

<p>UNIX EXAMPLES Here are some examples of the use of the
exec command on Unix.</p>

<p>To execute a simple program and get its result: exec
uname -a</p>

<p>To execute a program that can return a non-zero result,
you should wrap the call to exec in catch and check the
contents of the -errorcode return option if you have an
error: set status 0 if {[catch {exec grep foo bar.txt}
results options]} { set details [dict get $options
-errorcode] if {[lindex $details 0] eq
&quot;CHILDSTATUS&quot;} { set status [lindex $details 2] }
else { # Some kind of unexpected failure } }</p>

<p>When translating a command from a Unix shell invocation,
care should be taken over the fact that single quote
characters have no special sig- nificance to Tcl. Thus: awk
{sum += $1} END {print sum} numbers.list would be translated
into something like: exec awk {{sum += $1} END {print sum}}
numbers.list</p>

<p>If you are converting invocations involving shell
globbing, you should remember that Tcl does not handle
globbing or expand things into multi- ple arguments by
default. Instead you should write things like this: exec ls
-l {*}[glob *.tcl]</p>

<p>WINDOWS EXAMPLES Here are some examples of the use of
the exec command on Windows.</p>

<p>To start an instance of notepad editing a file without
waiting for the user to finish editing the file: exec
notepad myfile.txt &amp;</p>

<p>To print a text file using notepad: exec notepad /p
myfile.txt</p>

<p>If a program calls other programs, such as is common
with compilers, then you may need to resort to batch files
to hide the console windows that sometimes pop up: exec
cmp.bat somefile.c -o somefile With the file cmp.bat looking
something like: @gcc %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9</p>

<p>Sometimes you need to be careful, as different programs
may have the same name and be in the path. It can then
happen that typing a command at the DOS prompt finds a
different program than the same command run via exec. This
is because of the (documented) differences in behaviour
between exec and DOS batch files.</p>

<p>When in doubt, use the command auto_execok: it will
return the complete path to the program as seen by the exec
command. This applies espe- cially when you want to run
internal commands like dir from a Tcl script (if you just
want to list filenames, use the glob command.) To do that,
use this: exec {*}[auto_execok dir] *.tcl</p>
