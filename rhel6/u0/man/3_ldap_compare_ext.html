<p>LDAP_COMPARE(3) LDAP_COMPARE(3)</p>

<p>NAME ldap_compare, ldap_compare_s, ldap_compare_ext,
ldap_compare_ext_s - Perform an LDAP compare operation.</p>

<p>LIBRARY OpenLDAP LDAP (libldap, -lldap)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;ldap.h&gt;</p>

<p>int ldap_compare_ext( LDAP *ld, char *dn, char *attr,
const struct berval *bvalue, LDAPControl **serverctrls,
LDAPControl **clientctrls, int *msgidp );</p>

<p>int ldap_compare_ext_s( LDAP *ld, char *dn, char *attr,
const struct berval *bvalue, LDAPControl **serverctrls,
LDAPControl **clientctrls );</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The ldap_compare_ext_s() routine is used to
perform an LDAP compare operation synchronously. It takes
dn, the DN of the entry upon which to perform the compare,
and attr and value, the attribute description and value to
compare to those found in the entry. It returns a code,
which will be LDAP_COMPARE_TRUE if the entry contains the
attribute value and LDAP_COMPARE_FALSE if it does not.
Otherwise, an error code is returned that indicates the
nature of the problem. See ldap(3) for details.</p>

<p>The ldap_compare_ext() routine is used to perform an
LDAP compare oper- ation asynchronously. It takes the same
parameters as ldap_com- pare_ext_s(), but provides the
message id of the request it initiated in the integer
pointed to msgidp. The result of the compare can be obtained
by a subsequent call to ldap_result(3).</p>

<p>Both routines allow server and client controls to be
specified to extend the compare request.</p>

<p>DEPRECATED INTERFACES The routines ldap_compare() and
ldap_compare_s() are deprecated in favor of
ldap_compare_ext() and ldap_compare_ext_s(),
respectively.</p>

<p>Deprecated interfaces generally remain in the library.
The macro LDAP_DEPRECATED can be defined to a non-zero value
(e.g., -DLDAP_DEPRE- CATED=1) when compiling program
designed to use deprecated interfaces. It is recommended
that developers writing new programs, or updating old
programs, avoid use of deprecated interfaces. Over time, it
is expected that documentation (and, eventually, support)
for deprecated interfaces to be eliminated.</p>
