<p>SHOWQ(8) SHOWQ(8)</p>

<p>NAME showq - list the Postfix mail queue</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS showq [generic Postfix daemon options]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The showq(8) daemon reports the Postfix mail
queue status. It is the program that emulates the sendmail
mailq command.</p>

<p>The showq(8) daemon can also be run in stand-alone mode
by the supe- ruser. This mode of operation is used to
emulate the mailq command while the Postfix mail system is
down.</p>

<p>SECURITY The showq(8) daemon can run in a chroot jail at
fixed low privilege, and takes no input from the client. Its
service port is accessible to local untrusted users, so the
service can be susceptible to denial of service attacks.</p>

<p>STANDARDS None. The showq(8) daemon does not interact
with the outside world.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS Problems and transactions are logged to
syslogd(8).</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS Changes to main.cf are picked
up automatically as showq(8) processes run for only a
limited amount of time. Use the command &quot;postfix
reload&quot; to speed up a change.</p>

postconf(5) for more details including examples.</p>
