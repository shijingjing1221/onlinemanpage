<p>NAME r128 - ATI Rage 128 video driver</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS Section &quot;Device&quot; Identifier
&quot;devname&quot; Driver &quot;r128&quot; ...
EndSection</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION r128 is an Xorg driver for ATI Rage 128
based video cards. It contains full support for 8, 15, 16
and 24 bit pixel depths, hardware accelera- tion of drawing
primitives, hardware cursor, video modes up to 1800x1440 @
70Hz, doublescan modes (e.g., 320x200 and 320x240), gamma
correction at all pixel depths, a fully programming dot
clock and robust text mode restoration for VT switching.
Dualhead is supported on M3/M4 mobile chips.</p>

<p>SUPPORTED HARDWARE The r128 driver supports all ATI Rage
128 based video cards including the Rage Fury AGP 32MB, the
XPERT 128 AGP 16MB and the XPERT 99 AGP 8MB.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION DETAILS Please refer to xorg.conf(5) for
general configuration details. This section only covers
configuration details specific to this driver.</p>

<p>The driver auto-detects all device information necessary
to initialize the card. However, if you have problems with
auto-detection, you can specify:</p>

<p>VideoRam - in kilobytes MemBase - physical address of
the linear framebuffer IOBase - physical address of the MMIO
registers ChipID - PCI DEVICE ID</p>

<p>In addition, the following driver Options are
supported:</p>

<p>Option &quot;SWcursor&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Selects
software cursor. The default is off.</p>

<p>Option &quot;NoAccel&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Enables
or disables all hardware acceleration. The default is to
enable hardware acceleration.</p>

<p>Option &quot;Dac6Bit&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Enables
or disables the use of 6 bits per color component when in 8
bpp mode (emulates VGA mode). By default, all 8 bits per
color component are used. The default is off.</p>

<p>Option &quot;VideoKey&quot; &quot;integer&quot; This
overrides the default pixel value for the YUV video overlay
key. The default value is undefined.</p>

<p>Option &quot;Display&quot; &quot;string&quot; Select
display mode for devices which support flat panels. Sup-
ported modes are:</p>

<p>&quot;FP&quot; - use flat panel;</p>

<p>&quot;CRT&quot; - use cathode ray tube;</p>

<p>&quot;Mirror&quot; - use both FP and CRT;</p>

<p>&quot;BIOS&quot; - use mode as configured in the
BIOS.</p>

<p>The default is FP.</p>

<p>The following Options are mostly important for non-x86
architectures:</p>

<p>Option &quot;ProgramFPRegs&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
Enable or disable programming of the flat panel registers.
Beware that this may damage your panel, so use this at your
own risk. The default depends on the device.</p>

<p>Option &quot;PanelWidth&quot; &quot;integer&quot;</p>

<p>Option &quot;PanelHeight&quot; &quot;integer&quot;
Override the flat panel dimensions in pixels. They are used
to program the flat panel registers and normally determined
using the video card BIOS. If the wrong dimensions are used,
the sys- tem may hang.</p>

<p>Option &quot;UseFBDev&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Enable
or disable use of an OS-specific framebuffer device
interface (which is not supported on all OSs). See
fbdevhw(4) for further information. Default: on for PowerPC,
off for other architectures.</p>

<p>Option &quot;DMAForXv&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Try or
don t try to use DMA for Xv image transfers. This will
reduce CPU usage when playing big videos like DVDs, but may
cause instabilities. Default: off.</p>

<p>The following additional Options are supported:</p>

<p>Option &quot;ShowCache&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Enable
or disable viewing offscreen cache memory. A development
debug option. Default: off.</p>

<p>Option &quot;VGAAccess&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Tell
the driver if it can do legacy VGA IOs to the card. This is
necessary for properly resuming consoles when in VGA text
mode, but shouldnt be if the console is using radeonfb or
some other graphic mode driver. Some platforms like PowerPC
have issues with those, and they arent necessary unless you
have a real text mode in console. The default is off on
PowerPC and SPARC and on on other architectures.</p>

<p>Dualhead Note: The video BIOS on some laptops interacts
strangely with dualhead. This can result in flickering and
problems changing modes on crtc2. If you experience these
problems try toggling your laptops video output switch
(e.g., fn-f7, etc.) prior to starting X or switch to another
VT and back.</p>
