<p>XAddConnectionWatch(3) XLIB FUNCTIONS
XAddConnectionWatch(3)</p>

<p>NAME XAddConnectionWatch, XRemoveConnectionWatch,
XProcessInternalConnec- tion, XInternalConnectionNumbers -
handle Xlib internal connections</p>

<p>SYNTAX typedef void (*XConnectionWatchProc)(Display
*display, XPointer client_data, int fd, Bool opening,
XPointer *watch_data);</p>

<p>Status XAddConnectionWatch(Display *display, XWatchProc
procedure, XPointer client_data);</p>

<p>Status XRemoveConnectionWatch(Display *display,
XWatchProc procedure, XPointer client_data);</p>

<p>void XProcessInternalConnection(Display *display, int
fd);</p>

<p>Status XInternalConnectionNumbers(Display *display, int
**fd_return, int *count_return);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS client_data Specifies the additional client
data.</p>

<p>count_return Returns the number of file descriptors.</p>

<p>display Specifies the connection to the X server.</p>

<p>fd Specifies the file descriptor.</p>

<p>fd_return Returns the file descriptors.</p>

<p>procedure Specifies the procedure to be called.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The XAddConnectionWatch function registers a
procedure to be called each time Xlib opens or closes an
internal connection for the specified display. The procedure
is passed the display, the specified client_data, the file
descriptor for the connection, a Boolean indicat- ing
whether the connection is being opened or closed, and a
pointer to a location for private watch data. If opening is
True, the procedure can store a pointer to private data in
the location pointed to by watch_data; when the procedure is
later called for this same connection and opening is False,
the location pointed to by watch_data will hold this same
private data pointer.</p>

<p>This function can be called at any time after a display
is opened. If internal connections already exist, the
registered procedure will imme- diately be called for each
of them, before XAddConnectionWatch returns.
XAddConnectionWatch returns a nonzero status if the
procedure is suc- cessfully registered; otherwise, it
returns zero.</p>

<p>The registered procedure should not call any Xlib
functions. If the procedure directly or indirectly causes
the state of internal connec- tions or watch procedures to
change, the result is not defined. If Xlib has been
initialized for threads, the procedure is called with the
display locked and the result of a call by the procedure to
any Xlib function that locks the display is not defined
unless the executing thread has externally locked the
display using XLockDisplay.</p>

<p>The XRemoveConnectionWatch function removes a previously
registered connection watch procedure. The client_data must
match the client_data used when the procedure was initially
registered.</p>

<p>The XProcessInternalConnection function processes input
available on an internal connection. This function should be
called for an internal connection only after an operating
system facility (for example, select or poll) has indicated
that input is available; otherwise, the effect is not
defined.</p>

<p>The XInternalConnectionNumbers function returns a list
of the file descriptors for all internal connections
currently open for the speci- fied display. When the
allocated list is no longer needed, free it by using XFree.
This functions returns a nonzero status if the list is
successfully allocated; otherwise, it returns zero.</p>
