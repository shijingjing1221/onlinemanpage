<p>NAME pgmtoppm - colorize a PGM (grayscale) image into a
PPM (color) image</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pgmtoppm colorspec [pgmfile] pgmtoppm
colorspec1-colorspec2 [pgmfile] pgmtoppm -map=mapfile
[pgmfile]</p>

<p>Minimum unique abbreviation of option is acceptable. You
may use dou- ble hyphens instead of single hyphen to denote
options. You may use white space in place of the equals sign
to separate an option name from its value.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pgmtoppm reads a PGM as input and produces a PPM file as
output with a specific color assigned to each gray value in
the input.</p>

<p>If you specify one color argument, black in the pgm file
stays black and white in the pgm file turns into the
specified color in the ppm file. Gray values in between are
linearly mapped to differing intensi- ties of the specified
color.</p>

<p>If you specify two color arguments (separated by a
hyphen), then black gets mapped to the first color and white
gets mapped to the second and gray values in between get
mapped linearly (across a three dimensional space) to colors
in between.</p>

<p>Specify the color (color) as described for the argument
of the ppm_par- secolor() library routine .</p>

<p>Also, you can specify an entire colormap with the -map
option. The mapfile is just a ppm file; it can be any shape,
all that matters is the colors in it and their order. In
this case, black gets mapped into the first color in the map
file, and white gets mapped to the last and gray values in
between are mapped linearly onto the sequence of colors in
between. The maxval of the output image is the maxval of the
map image.</p>

<p>A more direct way to specify a particular color to
replace each partic- ular gray level is to use pamlookup.
You make an index file that explicitly associates a color
with each possible gray level.</p>

<p>NOTE - MAXVAL When you dont use -map, the maxval, or
depth, of the output image is the same as that of the input
image. The maxval affects the color res- olution, which may
cause quantization errors you don t anticipate in your
output. For example, you have a simple black and white image
as a PGM with maxval 1. Run this image through pgmtoppm
0f/00/00 to try to make the image black and faint red.
Because the output image will also have maxval 1, there is
no such thing as faint red. It has to be either full-on red
or black. pgmtoppm rounds the color 0f/00/00 down to black,
and you get an output image that is nothing but black.</p>

<p>The fix is easy: Pass the input through pamdepth on the
way into pgm- toppm to increase its depth to something that
would give you the reso- lution you need to get your desired
color. In this case, pamdepth 16 would do it. Or spare
yourself the unnecessary thinking and just say pamdepth
255.</p>

<p>PBM input is a special case. While you might think this
would be equivalent to a PGM with maxval 1 since only two
gray levels are neces- sary to represent a PBM image,
pgmtoppm, like all Netpbm programs, in fact treats it as a
maxval of 255.</p>
