<p>PUTMSG(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual PUTMSG(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME putmsg, putpmsg - send a message on a STREAM
(STREAMS)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stropts.h&gt;</p>

<p>int putmsg(int fildes, const struct strbuf *ctlptr,
const struct strbuf *dataptr, int flags); int putpmsg(int
fildes, const struct strbuf *ctlptr, const struct strbuf
*dataptr, int band, int flags);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The putmsg() function shall create a message
from a process buffer(s) and send the message to a STREAMS
file. The message may contain either a data part, a control
part, or both. The data and control parts are distinguished
by placement in separate buffers, as described below. The
semantics of each part are defined by the STREAMS module
that receives the message.</p>

<p>The putpmsg() function is equivalent to putmsg(), except
that the pro- cess can send messages in different priority
bands. Except where noted, all requirements on putmsg() also
pertain to putpmsg().</p>

<p>The fildes argument specifies a file descriptor
referencing an open STREAM. The ctlptr and dataptr arguments
each point to a strbuf struc- ture.</p>

<p>The ctlptr argument points to the structure describing
the control part, if any, to be included in the message. The
buf member in the str- buf structure points to the buffer
where the control information resides, and the len member
indicates the number of bytes to be sent. The maxlen member
is not used by putmsg(). In a similar manner, the argument
dataptr specifies the data, if any, to be included in the
mes- sage. The flags argument indicates what type of message
should be sent and is described further below.</p>

<p>To send the data part of a message, the application
shall ensure that dataptr is not a null pointer and the len
member of dataptr is 0 or greater. To send the control part
of a message, the application shall ensure that the
corresponding values are set for ctlptr. No data (con- trol)
part shall be sent if either dataptr( ctlptr) is a null
pointer or the len member of dataptr( ctlptr) is set to
-1.</p>

<p>For putmsg(), if a control part is specified and flags
is set to RS_HIPRI, a high priority message shall be sent.
If no control part is specified, and flags is set to
RS_HIPRI, putmsg() shall fail and set errno to [EINVAL]. If
flags is set to 0, a normal message (priority band equal to
0) shall be sent. If a control part and data part are not
specified and flags is set to 0, no message shall be sent
and 0 shall be returned.</p>

<p>For putpmsg(), the flags are different. The flags
argument is a bitmask with the following mutually-exclusive
flags defined: MSG_HIPRI and MSG_BAND. If flags is set to 0,
putpmsg() shall fail and set errno to [EINVAL]. If a control
part is specified and flags is set to MSG_HIPRI and band is
set to 0, a high-priority message shall be sent. If flags is
set to MSG_HIPRI and either no control part is specified or
band is set to a non-zero value, putpmsg() shall fail and
set errno to [EIN- VAL]. If flags is set to MSG_BAND, then a
message shall be sent in the priority band specified by
band. If a control part and data part are not specified and
flags is set to MSG_BAND, no message shall be sent and 0
shall be returned.</p>

<p>The putmsg() function shall block if the STREAM write
queue is full due to internal flow control conditions, with
the following exceptions:</p>

<p>* For high-priority messages, putmsg() shall not block
on this condi- tion and continues processing the
message.</p>

<p>* For other messages, putmsg() shall not block but shall
fail when the write queue is full and O_NONBLOCK is set.</p>

<p>The putmsg() function shall also block, unless prevented
by lack of internal resources, while waiting for the
availability of message blocks in the STREAM, regardless of
priority or whether O_NONBLOCK has been specified. No
partial message shall be sent.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, putmsg() and
putpmsg() shall return 0; oth- erwise, they shall return -1
and set errno to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The putmsg() and putpmsg() functions shall fail
if:</p>

<p>EAGAIN A non-priority message was specified, the
O_NONBLOCK flag is set, and the STREAM write queue is full
due to internal flow control conditions; or buffers could
not be allocated for the message that was to be created.</p>

<p>EBADF fildes is not a valid file descriptor open for
writing.</p>

<p>EINTR A signal was caught during putmsg().</p>

<p>EINVAL An undefined value is specified in flags, or
flags is set to RS_HIPRI or MSG_HIPRI and no control part is
supplied, or the STREAM or multiplexer referenced by fildes
is linked (directly or indirectly) downstream from a
multiplexer, or flags is set to MSG_HIPRI and band is
non-zero (for putpmsg() only).</p>

<p>ENOSR Buffers could not be allocated for the message
that was to be created due to insufficient STREAMS memory
resources.</p>

<p>ENOSTR A STREAM is not associated with fildes.</p>

<p>ENXIO A hangup condition was generated downstream for
the specified STREAM.</p>

<p>EPIPE or EIO The fildes argument refers to a
STREAMS-based pipe and the other end of the pipe is closed.
A SIGPIPE signal is generated for the calling thread.</p>

<p>ERANGE The size of the data part of the message does not
fall within the range specified by the maximum and minimum
packet sizes of the topmost STREAM module. This value is
also returned if the control part of the message is larger
than the maximum config- ured size of the control part of a
message, or if the data part of a message is larger than the
maximum configured size of the data part of a message.</p>

<p>In addition, putmsg() and putpmsg() shall fail if the
STREAM head had processed an asynchronous error before the
call. In this case, the value of errno does not reflect the
result of putmsg() or putpmsg(), but reflects the prior
error.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Sending a High-Priority Message The value of fd
is assumed to refer to an open STREAMS file. This call to
putmsg() does the following:</p>

<p>1. Creates a high-priority message with a control part
and a data part, using the buffers pointed to by ctrlbuf and
databuf, respec- tively.</p>

<p>2. Sends the message to the STREAMS file identified by
fd.</p>

<p>#include &lt;stropts.h&gt; #include &lt;string.h&gt; ...
int fd; char *ctrlbuf = &quot;This is the control
part&quot;; char *databuf = &quot;This is the data
part&quot;; struct strbuf ctrl; struct strbuf data; int
ret;</p>

<p>ctrl.buf = ctrlbuf; ctrl.len = strlen(ctrlbuf);</p>

<p>data.buf = databuf; data.len = strlen(databuf);</p>

<p>ret = putmsg(fd, &amp;ctrl, &amp;data, MSG_HIPRI);</p>

<p>Using putpmsg() This example has the same effect as the
previous example. In this exam- ple, however, the putpmsg()
function creates and sends the message to the STREAMS
file.</p>

<p>#include &lt;stropts.h&gt; #include &lt;string.h&gt; ...
int fd; char *ctrlbuf = &quot;This is the control
part&quot;; char *databuf = &quot;This is the data
part&quot;; struct strbuf ctrl; struct strbuf data; int
ret;</p>

<p>ctrl.buf = ctrlbuf; ctrl.len = strlen(ctrlbuf);</p>

<p>data.buf = databuf; data.len = strlen(databuf);</p>

<p>ret = putpmsg(fd, &amp;ctrl, &amp;data, 0,
MSG_HIPRI);</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
