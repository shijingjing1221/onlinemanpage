<p>XSelectInput(3) XLIB FUNCTIONS XSelectInput(3)</p>

<p>NAME XSelectInput - select input events</p>

<p>SYNTAX int XSelectInput(Display *display, Window w, long
event_mask);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS display Specifies the connection to the X
server.</p>

<p>event_mask Specifies the event mask.</p>

<p>w Specifies the window whose events you are interested
in.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The XSelectInput function requests that the
X server report the events associated with the specified
event mask. Initially, X will not report any of these
events. Events are reported relative to a window. If a
window is not interested in a device event, it usually
propagates to the closest ancestor that is interested,
unless the do_not_propagate mask prohibits it.</p>

<p>Setting the event-mask attribute of a window overrides
any previous call for the same window but not for other
clients. Multiple clients can select for the same events on
the same window with the following restrictions:</p>

<p>&middot; Multiple clients can select events on the same
window because their event masks are disjoint. When the X
server generates an event, it reports it to all interested
clients.</p>

<p>&middot; Only one client at a time can select
CirculateRequest, Configur- eRequest, or MapRequest events,
which are associated with the event mask
SubstructureRedirectMask.</p>

<p>&middot; Only one client at a time can select a
ResizeRequest event, which is associated with the event mask
ResizeRedirectMask.</p>

<p>&middot; Only one client at a time can select a
ButtonPress event, which is associated with the event mask
ButtonPressMask.</p>

<p>The server reports the event to all interested
clients.</p>

<p>XSelectInput can generate a BadWindow error.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS BadWindow A value for a Window argument does
not name a defined Window.</p>
