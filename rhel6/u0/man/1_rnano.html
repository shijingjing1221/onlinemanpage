<p>RNANO(1) RNANO(1)</p>

<p>NAME rnano - Restricted mode for Nanos ANOther editor,
an enhanced free Pico clone</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rnano [OPTIONS] [[+LINE,COLUMN] FILE]...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page briefly documents the rnano
command.</p>

<p>nano is a small, free and friendly editor which aims to
replace Pico, the default editor included in the non-free
Pine package. Rather than just copying Pico s look and feel,
nano also implements some missing (or disabled by default)
features in Pico, such as &quot;search and replace&quot; and
&quot;go to line and column number&quot;.</p>

<p>rnano is a restricted version of nano, which only edits
specific files and doesnt allow the user access to the
filesystem or a command shell.</p>

<p>In restricted mode, nano will not:</p>

<p>&middot; read or write to any file not specified on the
command line;</p>

<p>&middot; read any nanorc files;</p>

<p>&middot; allow suspending;</p>

<p>&middot; allow a file to be appended to, prepended to,
or saved under a dif- ferent name;</p>

<p>&middot; use backup files or spell checking.</p>

<p>OPTIONS +LINE,COLUMN Places cursor at line number LINE
and column number COLUMN (at least one of which must be
specified) on startup, instead of the default of line 1,
column 1.</p>

<p>-? Same as -h (--help).</p>

<p>-h (--help) Show a summary of command line options and
exit.</p>

<p>-V (--version) Show the current version number and
exit.</p>

<p>See the nano(1) manpage for the complete documentation
of nano.</p>
