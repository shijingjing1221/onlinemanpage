<p>GIT-BRANCH(1) Git Manual GIT-BRANCH(1)</p>

<p>NAME git-branch - List, create, or delete branches</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS git branch [--color[=&lt;when&gt;] |
--no-color] [-r | -a] [-v [--abbrev=&lt;length&gt; |
--no-abbrev]] [(--merged | --no-merged | --contains)
[&lt;commit&gt;]] git branch [--set-upstream | --track |
--no-track] [-l] [-f] &lt;branchname&gt;
[&lt;start-point&gt;] git branch (-m | -M)
[&lt;oldbranch&gt;] &lt;newbranch&gt; git branch (-d | -D)
[-r] &lt;branchname&gt;...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION With no arguments, existing branches are
listed and the current branch will be highlighted with an
asterisk. Option -r causes the remote-tracking branches to
be listed, and option -a shows both.</p>

<p>With --contains, shows only the branches that contain
the named commit (in other words, the branches whose tip
commits are descendants of the named commit). With --merged,
only branches merged into the named commit (i.e. the
branches whose tip commits are reachable from the named
commit) will be listed. With --no-merged only branches not
merged into the named commit will be listed. If the
&lt;commit&gt; argument is missing it defaults to HEAD (i.e.
the tip of the current branch).</p>

<p>The commands second form creates a new branch head named
&lt;branchname&gt; which points to the current HEAD, or
&lt;start-point&gt; if given.</p>

<p>Note that this will create the new branch, but it will
not switch the working tree to it; use &quot;git checkout
&lt;newbranch&gt;&quot; to switch to the new branch.</p>

<p>When a local branch is started off a remote branch, git
sets up the branch so that git pull will appropriately merge
from the remote branch. This behavior may be changed via the
global branch.autosetupmerge configuration flag. That
setting can be overridden by using the --track and
--no-track options.</p>

<p>With a -m or -M option, &lt;oldbranch&gt; will be
renamed to &lt;newbranch&gt;. If &lt;oldbranch&gt; had a
corresponding reflog, it is renamed to match
&lt;newbranch&gt;, and a reflog entry is created to remember
the branch renaming. If &lt;newbranch&gt; exists, -M must be
used to force the rename to happen.</p>

<p>With a -d or -D option, &lt;branchname&gt; will be
deleted. You may specify more than one branch for deletion.
If the branch currently has a reflog then the reflog will
also be deleted.</p>

<p>Use -r together with -d to delete remote-tracking
branches. Note, that it only makes sense to delete
remote-tracking branches if they no longer exist in the
remote repository or if git fetch was configured not to
fetch them again. See also the prune subcommand of
git-remote(1) for a way to clean up all obsolete
remote-tracking branches.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -d Delete a branch. The branch must be fully
merged in its upstream branch, or in HEAD if no upstream was
set with --track or --set-upstream.</p>

<p>-D Delete a branch irrespective of its merged
status.</p>

<p>-l Create the branchs reflog. This activates recording
of all changes made to the branch ref, enabling use of date
based sha1 expressions such as
&quot;&lt;branchname&gt;@{yesterday}&quot;. Note that in
non-bare repositories, reflogs are usually enabled by
default by the core.logallrefupdates config option.</p>

<p>-f, --force Reset &lt;branchname&gt; to
&lt;startpoint&gt; if &lt;branchname&gt; exists already.
Without -f git branch refuses to change an existing
branch.</p>

<p>-m Move/rename a branch and the corresponding
reflog.</p>

<p>-M Move/rename a branch even if the new branch name
already exists.</p>

<p>--color[=&lt;when&gt;] Color branches to highlight
current, local, and remote branches. The value must be
always (the default), never, or auto.</p>

<p>--no-color Turn off branch colors, even when the
configuration file gives the default to color output. Same
as --color=never.</p>

<p>-r List or delete (if used with -d) the remote-tracking
branches.</p>

<p>-a List both remote-tracking branches and local
branches.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose Show sha1 and commit subject line for each
head, along with relationship to upstream branch (if any).
If given twice, print the name of the upstream branch, as
well.</p>

<p>--abbrev=&lt;length&gt; Alter the sha1s minimum display
length in the output listing. The default value is 7.</p>

<p>--no-abbrev Display the full sha1s in the output listing
rather than abbreviating them.</p>

<p>-t, --track When creating a new branch, set up
configuration to mark the start-point branch as
&quot;upstream&quot; from the new branch. This configuration
will tell git to show the relationship between the two
branches in git status and git branch -v. Furthermore, it
directs git pull without arguments to pull from the upstream
when the new branch is checked out.</p>

<p>This behavior is the default when the start point is a
remote branch. Set the branch.autosetupmerge configuration
variable to false if you want git checkout and git branch to
always behave as if --no-track were given. Set it to always
if you want this behavior when the start-point is either a
local or remote branch.</p>

<p>--no-track Do not set up &quot;upstream&quot;
configuration, even if the branch.autosetupmerge
configuration variable is true.</p>

<p>--set-upstream If specified branch does not exist yet or
if --force has been given, acts exactly like --track.
Otherwise sets up configuration like --track would when
creating the branch, except that where branch points to is
not changed.</p>

<p>--contains &lt;commit&gt; Only list branches which
contain the specified commit.</p>

<p>--merged [&lt;commit&gt;] Only list branches whose tips
are reachable from the specified commit (HEAD if not
specified).</p>

<p>--no-merged [&lt;commit&gt;] Only list branches whose
tips are not reachable from the specified commit (HEAD if
not specified).</p>

<p>&lt;branchname&gt; The name of the branch to create or
delete. The new branch name must pass all checks defined by
git-check-ref-format(1). Some of these checks may restrict
the characters allowed in a branch name.</p>

<p>&lt;start-point&gt; The new branch head will point to
this commit. It may be given as a branch name, a commit-id,
or a tag. If this option is omitted, the current HEAD will
be used instead.</p>

<p>&lt;oldbranch&gt; The name of an existing branch to
rename.</p>

<p>&lt;newbranch&gt; The new name for an existing branch.
The same restrictions as for &lt;branchname&gt; apply.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Start development from a known tag</p>

<p>$ git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/.../linux-2.6
my2.6 $ cd my2.6 $ git branch my2.6.14 v2.6.14 (1) $ git
checkout my2.6.14</p>

<p>1. This step and the next one could be combined into a
single step with &quot;checkout -b my2.6.14
v2.6.14&quot;.</p>

<p>Delete an unneeded branch</p>

<p>$ git clone git://git.kernel.org/.../git.git my.git $ cd
my.git $ git branch -d -r origin/todo origin/html origin/man
(1) $ git branch -D test (2)</p>

<p>1. Delete the remote-tracking branches &quot;todo&quot;,
&quot;html&quot; and &quot;man&quot;. The next fetch or pull
will create them again unless you configure them not to. See
git-fetch(1). 2. Delete the &quot;test&quot; branch even if
the &quot;master&quot; branch (or whichever branch is
currently checked out) does not have all commits from the
test branch.</p>

<p>NOTES If you are creating a branch that you want to
checkout immediately, it is easier to use the git checkout
command with its -b option to create a branch and check it
out with a single command.</p>

<p>The options --contains, --merged and --no-merged serve
three related but different purposes:</p>

<p>&middot; --contains &lt;commit&gt; is used to find all
branches which will need special attention if &lt;commit&gt;
were to be rebased or amended, since those branches contain
the specified &lt;commit&gt;.</p>

<p>&middot; --merged is used to find all branches which can
be safely deleted, since those branches are fully contained
by HEAD.</p>

<p>&middot; --no-merged is used to find branches which are
candidates for merging into HEAD, since those branches are
not fully contained by HEAD.</p>
