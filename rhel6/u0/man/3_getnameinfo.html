<p>GETNAMEINFO(3) Linux Programmer s Manual
GETNAMEINFO(3)</p>

<p>NAME getnameinfo - address-to-name translation in
protocol-independent man- ner</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt; #include
&lt;netdb.h&gt;</p>

<p>int getnameinfo(const struct sockaddr *sa, socklen_t
salen, char *host, size_t hostlen, char *serv, size_t
servlen, int flags);</p>

<p>Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
feature_test_macros(7)):</p>

<p>getnameinfo(): _POSIX_C_SOURCE &gt;= 1 || _XOPEN_SOURCE
|| _POSIX_SOURCE</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The getnameinfo() function is the inverse of
getaddrinfo(3): it con- verts a socket address to a
corresponding host and service, in a proto- col-independent
manner. It combines the functionality of gethost- byaddr(3)
and getservbyport(3), but unlike those functions, getad-
drinfo(3) is reentrant and allows programs to eliminate
IPv4-versus- IPv6 dependencies.</p>

<p>The sa argument is a pointer to a generic socket address
structure (of type sockaddr_in or sockaddr_in6) of size
salen that holds the input IP address and port number. The
arguments host and serv are pointers to caller-allocated
buffers (of size hostlen and servlen respectively) into
which getnameinfo() places null-terminated strings
containing the host and service names respectively.</p>

<p>The caller can specify that no hostname (or no service
name) is required by providing a NULL host (or serv)
argument or a zero hostlen (or servlen) argument. However,
at least one of hostname or service name must be
requested.</p>

<p>The flags argument modifies the behavior of
getnameinfo() as follows:</p>

<p>NI_NAMEREQD If set, then an error is returned if the
hostname cannot be determined.</p>

<p>NI_DGRAM If set, then the service is datagram (UDP)
based rather than stream (TCP) based. This is required for
the few ports (512-514) that have different services for UDP
and TCP.</p>

<p>NI_NOFQDN If set, return only the hostname part of the
fully qualified domain name for local hosts.</p>

<p>NI_NUMERICHOST If set, then the numeric form of the
hostname is returned. (When not set, this will still happen
in case the nodes name cannot be determined.)</p>

<p>NI_NUMERICSERV If set, then the numeric form of the
service address is returned. (When not set, this will still
happen in case the services name cannot be determined.)</p>

<p>Extensions to getaddrinfo() for Internationalized Domain
Names Starting with glibc 2.3.4, getnameinfo() has been
extended to selec- tively allow hostnames to be
transparently converted to and from the Internationalized
Domain Name (IDN) format (see RFC 3490, Internation- alizing
Domain Names in Applications (IDNA)). Three new flags are
defined:</p>

<p>NI_IDN If this flag is used, then the name found in the
lookup process is converted from IDN format to the locale s
encoding if neces- sary. ASCII-only names are not affected
by the conversion, which makes this flag usable in existing
programs and environ- ments.</p>

<p>NI_IDN_ALLOW_UNASSIGNED, NI_IDN_USE_STD3_ASCII_RULES
Setting these flags will enable the IDNA_ALLOW_UNASSIGNED
(allow unassigned Unicode code points) and
IDNA_USE_STD3_ASCII_RULES (check output to make sure it is a
STD3 conforming hostname) flags respectively to be used in
the IDNA handling.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success 0 is returned, and node and
service names, if requested, are filled with null-terminated
strings, possibly truncated to fit the specified buffer
lengths. On error one of the following non-zero error codes
is returned:</p>

<p>EAI_AGAIN The name could not be resolved at this time.
Try again later.</p>

<p>EAI_BADFLAGS The flags argument has an invalid
value.</p>

<p>EAI_FAIL A non-recoverable error occurred.</p>

<p>EAI_FAMILY The address family was not recognized, or the
address length was invalid for the specified family.</p>

<p>EAI_MEMORY Out of memory.</p>

<p>EAI_NONAME The name does not resolve for the supplied
arguments. NI_NAMEREQD is set and the hosts name cannot be
located, or neither hostname nor service name were
requested.</p>

<p>EAI_OVERFLOW The buffer pointed to by host or serv was
too small.</p>

<p>EAI_SYSTEM A system error occurred. The error code can
be found in errno.</p>

<p>The gai_strerror(3) function translates these error
codes to a human readable string, suitable for error
reporting.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/hosts /etc/nsswitch.conf /etc/resolv.conf</p>

<p>VERSIONS getnameinfo() is provided in glibc since
version 2.1.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO RFC 2553, POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>NOTES In order to assist the programmer in choosing
reasonable sizes for the supplied buffers, &lt;netdb.h&gt;
defines the constants</p>

<p>#define NI_MAXHOST 1025 #define NI_MAXSERV 32</p>

<p>The former is the constant MAXDNAME in recent versions
of BINDs &lt;arpa/nameser.h&gt; header file. The latter is a
guess based on the ser- vices listed in the current Assigned
Numbers RFC.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE The following code tries to get the numeric
hostname and service name, for a given socket address. Note
that there is no hardcoded reference to a particular address
family.</p>

<p>struct sockaddr *sa; /* input */ socklen_t len; /* input
*/ char hbuf[NI_MAXHOST], sbuf[NI_MAXSERV];</p>

<p>if (getnameinfo(sa, len, hbuf, sizeof(hbuf), sbuf,
sizeof(sbuf), NI_NUMERICHOST | NI_NUMERICSERV) == 0)
printf(&quot;host=%s, serv=%s0, hbuf, sbuf);</p>

<p>The following version checks if the socket address has a
reverse address mapping.</p>

<p>struct sockaddr *sa; /* input */ socklen_t len; /* input
*/ char hbuf[NI_MAXHOST];</p>

<p>if (getnameinfo(sa, len, hbuf, sizeof(hbuf), NULL, 0,
NI_NAMEREQD)) printf(&quot;could not resolve
hostname&quot;); else printf(&quot;host=%s0, hbuf);</p>

getaddrinfo(3).</p>
