<p>NAME orca - a screen reader / magnifier</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS orca [option...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION orca is a screen reader for people with
visual impairments, and pro- vides alternative access to the
desktop by making use of speech synthe- sis, braille, and
magnification support on the platform.</p>

<p>In addition, orca only provides access to
applications/toolkits that support the assistive technology
service provide interface (AT-SPI), which include GTK,
Mozilla, Firefox, Evolution, OpenOffice, StarOffice,
Java/Swing, etc.</p>

<p>WARNING: suspending orca, e.g. by pressing Control-Z,
from an AT-SPI enabled shell (such as gnome-terminal), can
also suspend the desktop until Orca is killed.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -s, --gui-setup, --setup When starting orca,
bring up the GUI configuration dialog.</p>

<p>-t, --text-setup When starting orca, initiate the
text-based configuration.</p>

<p>-n, --no-setup When starting orca, force the application
to be started without configuration, even though it might
have needed it. This is use- ful when starting orca via
something like gdm.</p>

<p>-u dirname</p>

<p>--user-prefs-dir=dirname When starting orca, use dirname
as an alternate directory for the user preferences.</p>

<p>-e
speech|braille|braille-monitor|magnifier|main-window</p>


<p>--enable=speech|braille|braille-monitor|magnifier|main-window
When starting orca, force the enabling of the supplied
options.</p>

<p>-d
speech|braille|braille-monitor|magnifier|main-window</p>


<p>--disable=speech|braille|braille-monitor|magnifier|main-window
When starting orca, force the disabling of the supplied
options.</p>

<p>-?, -h, --help Show the help message of this release of
the orca program.</p>

<p>-l, --list-apps Prints the names of all the currently
running applications. This is used primarily for debugging
purposes to see if orca can talk to the accessibility
infrastructure. Note that if orca is already running, this
will not kill the other orca process. It will just list the
currently running applications, and you will see orca listed
twice: once for the existing orca and once for this
instance.</p>

<p>--debug Enables debug output for orca and sends all
debug output to a file with a name of the form
debug-YYYY-MM-DD-HH:MM:SS.out in the current directory. The
YYYY-MM-DD-HH:MM:SS portion will be replaced with the
current date and time.</p>

<p>--debug-file=filename Enables debug output for orca and
sends all debug output to the given filename.</p>

<p>-v, --version Return the orca version number.</p>

<p>-q, --quit Quit orca.</p>

<p>AUTHOR orca development is a community effort led by the
Sun Microsystems Inc. Accessibility Program Office.</p>
