<p>NAME ftok - convert a pathname and a project identifier
to a System V IPC key</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; #include
&lt;sys/ipc.h&gt;</p>

<p>key_t ftok(const char *pathname, int proj_id);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The ftok() function uses the identity of the
file named by the given pathname (which must refer to an
existing, accessible file) and the least significant 8 bits
of proj_id (which must be non-zero) to gener- ate a key_t
type System V IPC key, suitable for use with msgget(2),
semget(2), or shmget(2).</p>

<p>The resulting value is the same for all pathnames that
name the same file, when the same value of proj_id is used.
The value returned should be different when the
(simultaneously existing) files or the project IDs
differ.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success the generated key_t value is
returned. On failure -1 is returned, with errno indicating
the error as for the stat(2) system call.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>NOTES Under libc4 and libc5 (and under SunOS 4.x) the
prototype was:</p>

<p>key_t ftok(char *pathname, char proj_id);</p>

<p>Today proj_id is an int, but still only 8 bits are used.
Typical usage has an ASCII character proj_id, that is why
the behavior is said to be undefined when proj_id is
zero.</p>

<p>Of course no guarantee can be given that the resulting
key_t is unique. Typically, a best effort attempt combines
the given proj_id byte, the lower 16 bits of the inode
number, and the lower 8 bits of the device number into a
32-bit result. Collisions may easily happen, for example
between files on /dev/hda1 and files on /dev/sda1.</p>
