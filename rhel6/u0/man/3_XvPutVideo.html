<p>NAME XvPutVideo - write video into a drawable</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;X11/extensions/Xvlib.h&gt;</p>

<p>int XvPutVideo(Display *dpy, XvPortID port, Drawable d,
GC gc, int vx, int vy, unsigned int vw, unsigned int vh, int
dx, int dy, unsigned int dw, unsigned int dh);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS dpy Specifies the connection to the X
server.</p>

<p>port Defines the port from which to get video.</p>

<p>d Defines the drawable (window) into which video is to
be written.</p>

<p>gc Defines the graphical context. GC components are:
sub- window-mode, clip-x-origin, clip-y-origin, and clip-
mask.</p>

<p>vx,vy,vw,vh Define the size and location of the source
(video) region to be written. vx and vy define the
upper-left pixel of the region. vw and vh define the width
and height, in pixels, of the region.</p>

<p>dx,dy,dw,dh Define the location and size of the
destination (draw- able) region into which the video image
is written. dx and dy define the upper-left pixel of the
region. dw and dh define the width and height, in pixels, of
the region.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION XvPutVideo writes video into a drawable. The
position and size of the source (video) rectangle is
specified by vx, vy, vw, and vh. The posi- tion and size of
the destination (drawable) rectangle is specified by dx, dy,
dw, and dh.</p>

<p>Video data is clipped to the bounds of the video
encoding, scaled to the requested drawable region size (or
the closest size supported) and clipped to the bounds of the
drawable.</p>

<p>If video is successfully initiated, an XvVideoNotify
event with detail XvStarted is generated for the drawable.
If the port is already in use, its video is preempted, and
if the new drawable is different than the old, an
XvVideoNotify event with detail XvPreempted is generated for
the old drawable. If the port is grabbed by another client,
this request is ignored, and an XvVideoNotify event with
detail XvBusy is generated for the drawable. If the port is
not receiving a valid video signal or if the video signal is
interrupted while video is active a VideoNotify event with
detail XvHardError is generated for the draw- able.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUES [Success] Returned if XvPutVideo(3)
completed successfully.</p>

<p>[XvBadExtension] Returned if the Xv extension is
unavailable.</p>

<p>[XvBadAlloc] Returned if there were insufficient
resources to process the request.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS [XvBadPort] Generated if the requested port
does not exist.</p>

<p>[BadDrawable] Generated if the requested drawable does
not exist.</p>

<p>[BadGC] Generated if the requested graphics context does
not exist.</p>

<p>[BadAlloc] Generated if there were insufficient
resources to process the request.</p>
