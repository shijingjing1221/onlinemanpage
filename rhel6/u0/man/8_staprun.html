<p>NAME staprun - systemtap runtime</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS staprun [ OPTIONS ] MODULE [ MODULE-OPTIONS
]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The staprun program is the back-end of the
Systemtap tool. It expects a kernel module produced by the
front-end stap tool.</p>

<p>Splitting the systemtap tool into a front-end and a
back-end allows a user to compile a systemtap script on a
development machine that has the kernel debugging
information (need to compile the script) and then transfer
the resulting kernel module to a production machine that
doesn t have any development tools or kernel debugging
information installed.</p>

<p>This manual corresponds to version 1.2.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The staprun program supports the following
options. Any other option prints a list of supported
options.</p>

<p>-v Verbose mode.</p>

<p>-c CMD Command CMD will be run and the staprun program
will exit when CMD does. The _stp_target variable will
contain the pid for CMD.</p>

<p>-x PID The _stp_target variable will be set to PID.</p>

<p>-o FILE Send output to FILE. If the module uses bulk
mode, the output will be in percpu files FILE_x(FILE_cpux in
background and bulk mode) where x is the cpu number. This
supports strftime(3) formats for FILE.</p>

<p>-b BUFFER_SIZE The systemtap module will specify a
buffer size. Setting one here will override that value. The
value should be an integer between 1 and 4095 which be
assumed to be the buffer size in MB. That value will be
per-cpu if bulk mode is used.</p>

<p>-L Load module and start probes, then detach from the
module leav- ing the probes running. The module can be
attached to later by using the -A option.</p>

<p>-A Attach to loaded systemtap module.</p>

<p>-d Delete a module. Only detached or unused modules the
user has permission to access will be deleted. Use
&quot;*&quot; (quoted) to delete all unused modules.</p>

<p>-D Run staprun in background as a daemon and show its
pid.</p>

<p>-S size[,N] Sets the maximum size of output file and the
maximum number of output files. If the size of output file
will exceed size , systemtap switches output file to the
next file. And if the number of output files exceed N ,
systemtap removes the oldest output file. You can omit the
second argument.</p>

<p>var1=val Sets the value of global variable var1 to val.
Global variables contained within a module are treated as
module options and can be set from the staprun command
line.</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS MODULE is either a module path or a module
name. If it is a module name, the module will be looked for
in the following directory (where VERSION is the output of
&quot;uname -r&quot;):</p>

<p>/lib/modules/VERSION/systemtap</p>

<p>Any additional arguments on the command line are passed
to the module. One use of these additional module arguments
is to set the value of global variables declared within the
module.</p>

<p>$ stap -p4 -m mod1 -e &rsquo;global
var1=&quot;foo&quot;; probe begin{printf(&quot;%s0, var1);
exit()}&rsquo;</p>

<p>Running this with an additional module argument:</p>

<p>$ staprun mod1.ko var1=&quot;HelloWorld&quot;
HelloWorld</p>

<p>Spaces and exclamation marks currently cannot be passed
into global variables this way.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES See the stapex(3stap) manual page for a
collection of sample scripts.</p>

<p>Here is a very basic example of how to use staprun.
First, use stap to compile a script. The stap program will
report the pathname to the resulting module.</p>

<p>$ stap -p4 -e &rsquo;probe begin { printf(&quot;Hello
World!0); exit() }&rsquo;
/home/user/.systemtap/cache/85/stap_8553d83f78c_265.ko</p>

<p>Run staprun with the pathname to the module as an
argument.</p>

<p>$ staprun
/home/user/.systemtap/cache/85/stap_8553d83f78c_265.ko Hello
World!</p>

<p>MODULE DETACHING AND ATTACHING After the staprun program
installs a Systemtap kernel module, users can detach from
the kernel module and reattach to it later. The -L option
loads the module and automatically detaches. Users can also
detach from the kernel module interactively by sending the
SIGQUIT signal from the keyboard (typically by typing
Ctrl-.</p>

<p>To reattach to a kernel module, the staprun -A option
would be used.</p>

<p>FILE SWITCHING BY SIGNAL After the staprun launched the
stapio , users can command it to switch output file to next
file when it outputs to file(s) (running staprun with -o
option) by sending a SIGUSR2 signal to the stapio process.
When it receives SIGUSR2, it will switch output file to new
file with suffix .N where N is the sequential number. For
example,</p>

<p>$ staprun -o foo ...</p>

<p>outputs trace logs to foo and if it receives SIGUSR2
signal, it switches output to foo.1 file. And receiving
SIGUSR2 again, it switches to foo.2 file.</p>

<p>SAFETY AND SECURITY Systemtap is an administrative tool.
It exposes kernel internal data structures and potentially
private user information. See the stap(1) manual page for
additional information on safety and security.</p>

<p>To increase system security, only the root user and
members of the stapdev group can use staprun to insert
systemtap modules (or attach to existing ones). Members of
the stapusr group can use staprun to insert or remove
systemtap modules (or attach to existing systemtap modules)
under the following conditions:</p>

<p>&middot; The module is located in the
/lib/modules/VERSION/systemtap direc- tory. This directory
must be owned by root and not be world writable.</p>

<p>&middot; The module has been signed by a trusted signer.
Trusted signers are normally systemtap compile servers which
sign modules when the --unprivileged option is specified by
the client. See the stap- server(8) manual page for a for
more information.</p>

<p>FILES /lib/modules/VERSION/systemtap If MODULE is a
module name, the module will be looked for in this
directory. Users who are only in the _stapusr_ group can
install modules located in this directory. This directory
must be owned by the root user and not be world
writable.</p>
