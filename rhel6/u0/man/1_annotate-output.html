<p>ANNOTATE-OUTPUT(1) ANNOTATE-OUTPUT(1)</p>

<p>NAME annotate-output - annotate program output with time
and stream</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS annotate-output program [args ...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION annotate-output will execute the specified
program, while prepending every line with the current time
and O for stdout and E for stderr.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE $ annotate-output make 21:41:21 I: Started make
21:41:21 O: gcc -Wall program.c 21:43:18 E: program.c:
Couldnt compile, and took me ages to find out 21:43:19 E:
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status 21:43:19 E: make: ***
[all] Error 1 21:43:19 I: Finished with exitcode 2</p>

<p>BUGS Since stdout and stderr are processed in parallel,
it can happen that some lines received on stdout will show
up before later-printed stderr lines (and vice-versa).</p>

<p>This is unfortunately very hard to fix with the current
annotation strategy. A fix would involve switching to
PTRACEing the process. Giving nice a (much) higher priority
over the executed program could however cause this behaviour
to show up less frequently.</p>

<p>The program does not work as well when the output is not
linewise. In particular, when an interactive program asks
for input, the question might not be shown until after you
have answered it. This will give the impression that the
annotated program has hung, while it has not.</p>

<p>annotate-output does not currently accept any
command-line options, so --help, --version, and that kind of
stuff do not currently work (unless you install
/usr/bin/--help ;) ).</p>

<p>TODO Accept --help, --version command-line options.</p>

<p>Get rich with this very sophisticated piece of bash.</p>

<p>WEBSITE/SUPPORT The most recent version of this utility
is on http://jeroen.A- Eskwadraat.nl/sw/annotate</p>

<p>This program is community-supported (meaning: you ll
need to fix it yourself). Patches are however appreciated,
as is any feedback (posi- tive or negative).</p>
