<p>NAME XmIsTraversable A function that identifies whether
a widget can be traversed</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;Xm/Xm.h&gt; Boolean
XmIsTraversable( Widget widget);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION XmIsTraversable determines whether the
specified widget is eligible to receive focus through
keyboard traversal. In general, a widget is eli- gible to
receive focus when all of the following conditions are
true:</p>

<p>&middot; The widget and its ancestors are not being
destroyed, are sensi- tive, and have a value of True for
XmNtraversalOn.</p>

<p>&middot; The widget and its ancestors are realized,
managed, and (except for gadgets) mapped. If an application
unmaps a widget that has its XmNmappedWhenManaged resource
set to True, the return value is undefined.</p>

<p>&middot; Some part of the widget s rectangular area is
unobscured by the widget s ancestors, or some part of the
widgets rectangular area is inside the work window (but
possibly outside the clip window) of a ScrolledWindow whose
XmNscrollingPolicy is XmAUTOMATIC and whose
XmNtraverseObscuredCallback is not NULL.</p>

<p>Some widgets may not be eligible to receive focus even
if they meet all these conditions. For example, most
managers cannot receive focus through keyboard traversal.
Some widgets may be eligible to receive focus under
particular conditions. For example, a DrawingArea is eli-
gible to receive focus if it meets the conditions above and
has no child whose XmNtraversalOn resource is True.</p>

<p>Note that when all widgets in a shell hierarchy have
been made untraversable, they are considered to have lost
focus. When a widget in this hierarchy is made traversable
again, it regains focus.</p>

<p>XmIsTraversable may return unexpected results when
widget or its ances- tors are overlapped by their
siblings.</p>

<p>widget Specifies the ID of the widget</p>

<p>RETURN Returns True if the widget is eligible to receive
focus through key- board traversal; otherwise, returns
False.</p>
