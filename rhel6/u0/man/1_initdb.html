<p>NAME initdb - create a new PostgreSQL database
cluster</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS initdb [ option... ] [ --pgdata ] [ -D ]
directory</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION initdb creates a new PostgreSQL database
cluster. A database cluster is a collection of databases
that are managed by a single server instance.</p>

<p>Creating a database cluster consists of creating the
directories in which the database data will live, generating
the shared catalog tables (tables that belong to the whole
cluster rather than to any particular database), and
creating the template1 and postgres databases. When you
later create a new database, everything in the template1
database is copied. (Therefore, anything installed in
template1 is automatically copied into each database created
later.) The postgres database is a default database meant
for use by users, utilities and third party
applications.</p>

<p>Although initdb will attempt to create the specified
data directory, it might not have permission if the parent
directory of the desired data directory is root-owned. To
initialize in such a setup, create an empty data directory
as root, then use chown to assign ownership of that
directory to the database user account, then su to become
the database user to run initdb.</p>

<p>initdb must be run as the user that will own the server
process, because the server needs to have access to the
files and directories that initdb creates. Since the server
cannot be run as root, you must not run initdb as root
either. (It will in fact refuse to do so.)</p>

<p>initdb initializes the database clusters default locale
and character set encoding. The character set encoding,
collation order (LC_COLLATE) and character set classes
(LC_CTYPE, e.g. upper, lower, digit) can be set separately
for a database when it is created. initdb determines those
settings for the template1 database, which will serve as the
default for all other databases.</p>

<p>To alter the default collation order or character set
classes, use the --lc-collate and --lc-ctype options.
Collation orders other than C or POSIX also have a
performance penalty. For these reasons it is impor- tant to
choose the right locale when running initdb.</p>

<p>The remaining locale categories can be changed later
when the server is started. You can also use --locale to set
the default for all locale categories, including collation
order and character set classes. All server locale values
(lc_*) can be displayed via SHOW ALL. More details can be
found in in the documentation.</p>

<p>To alter the default encoding, use the --encoding. More
details can be found in in the documentation.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -A authmethod</p>

<p>--auth=authmethod This option specifies the
authentication method for local users used in pg_hba.conf.
Do not use trust unless you trust all local users on your
system. Trust is the default for ease of installa- tion.</p>

<p>-D directory</p>

<p>--pgdata=directory This option specifies the directory
where the database cluster should be stored. This is the
only information required by initdb, but you can avoid
writing it by setting the PGDATA envi- ronment variable,
which can be convenient since the database server (postgres)
can find the database directory later by the same
variable.</p>

<p>-E encoding</p>

<p>--encoding=encoding Selects the encoding of the template
database. This will also be the default encoding of any
database you create later, unless you override it there. The
default is derived from the locale, or SQL_ASCII if that
does not work. The character sets supported by the
PostgreSQL server are described in in the documentation.</p>

<p>--locale=locale Sets the default locale for the database
cluster. If this option is not specified, the locale is
inherited from the environment that initdb runs in. Locale
support is described in in the docu- mentation.</p>

<p>--lc-collate=locale</p>

<p>--lc-ctype=locale</p>

<p>--lc-messages=locale</p>

<p>--lc-monetary=locale</p>

<p>--lc-numeric=locale</p>

<p>--lc-time=locale Like --locale, but only sets the locale
in the specified cate- gory.</p>

<p>-X directory</p>

<p>--xlogdir=directory This option specifies the directory
where the transaction log should be stored.</p>

<p>-U username</p>

<p>--username=username Selects the user name of the
database superuser. This defaults to the name of the
effective user running initdb. It is really not important
what the superusers name is, but one might choose to keep
the customary name postgres, even if the operating sys- tem
users name is different.</p>

<p>-W</p>

<p>--pwprompt Makes initdb prompt for a password to give
the database supe- ruser. If you don t plan on using
password authentication, this is not important. Otherwise
you wont be able to use password authentication until you
have a password set up.</p>

<p>--pwfile=filename Makes initdb read the database
superusers password from a file. The first line of the file
is taken as the password.</p>

<p>Other, less commonly used, parameters are also
available:</p>

<p>-d</p>

<p>--debug Print debugging output from the bootstrap
backend and a few other messages of lesser interest for the
general public. The bootstrap backend is the program initdb
uses to create the cata- log tables. This option generates a
tremendous amount of extremely boring output.</p>

<p>-L directory Specifies where initdb should find its
input files to initialize the database cluster. This is
normally not necessary. You will be told if you need to
specify their location explicitly.</p>

<p>-n</p>

<p>--noclean By default, when initdb determines that an
error prevented it from completely creating the database
cluster, it removes any files it might have created before
discovering that it cannot finish the job. This option
inhibits tidying-up and is thus use- ful for debugging.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT PGDATA Specifies the directory where the
database cluster is to be stored; can be overridden using
the -D option.</p>

<p>This utility, like most other PostgreSQL utilities, also
uses the envi- ronment variables supported by libpq (see in
the documentation).</p>
