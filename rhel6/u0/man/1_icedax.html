[-a divider] [-t track[+endtrack]] [-i index] [-o offset]
[-d duration] [-x] [-q] [-w] [-v optlist] [-V] [-Q] [-J] [-L

<p>DESCRIPTION icedax stands for InCrEdible Digital Audio
eXtractor. It can retrieve audio tracks (CDDA) from CDROM
drives that are capable of reading audio data digitally to
the host (see README for a list of drives).</p>

<p>OPTIONS dev=device</p>

<p>-D device</p>

<p>-device device uses device as the source for CDDA
reading. For example /dev/cdrom or Bus,ID,Lun. The device
specification can also have influence on the selection of
the driver interface (eg. on Linux). See the -I option for
details.</p>

<p>The setting of the environment variable CDDA_DEVICE is
overrid- den by this option.</p>

<p>-A auxdevice</p>

<p>-auxdevice auxdevice uses auxdevice as CDROM drive for
ioctl usage.</p>

<p>-I interface</p>

<p>-interface interface specifies the interface for CDROM
access: generic_scsi or (on Linux, and FreeBSD systems)
cooked_ioctl.</p>

<p>Using the cooked_ioctl is not recommended as this makes
icedax mainly depend on the audio extraction quality of the
operating system which is usually extremely bad.</p>

<p>-c channels --channels uses 1 for mono, or 2 for stereo
recording, or s for stereo recording with both channels
swapped.</p>

<p>-s --stereo sets to stereo recording.</p>

<p>-m --mono sets to mono recording.</p>

<p>-x --max sets maximum (CD) quality.</p>

<p>-b bits --bits-per-sample sets bits per sample per
channel: 8, 12 or 16.</p>

<p>-r rate --rate sets rate in samples per second. Possible
values are listed with the -R option.</p>

<p>-a divider --divider sets rate to 44100Hz / divider.
Possible values are listed with the -R option.</p>

<p>-R --dump-rates shows a list of all sample rates and
their dividers.</p>

<p>-P sectors --set-overlap sets the initial number of
overlap sectors for jitter correc- tion.</p>

<p>-n sectors --sectors-per-request reads sectors per
request.</p>

<p>-l buffers --buffers-in-ring uses a ring buffer with
buffers total.</p>

<p>-t track+endtrack --track selects the start track and
optionally the end track.</p>

<p>-i index --index selects the start index.</p>

<p>-o offset --offset starts offset sectors behind start
track (one sector equivalents 1/75 seconds).</p>

<p>-O audiotype --output-format can be wav (for wav files)
or aiff (for apple/sgi aiff files) or aifc (for apple/sgi
aifc files) or au or sun (for sun .au PCM files) or cdr or
raw (for headerless files to be used for cd writers).</p>

<p>-C endianess --cdrom-endianess sets endianess of the
input samples to little, big or guess to override
defaults.</p>

<p>-E endianess --output-endianess sets endianess of the
output samples to little or big to override defaults.</p>

<p>-d duration --duration sets recording time in seconds or
frames. Frames (sectors) are indicated by a f suffix (like
75f for 75 sectors). 0 sets the time for whole track.</p>

<p>-B --bulk --alltracks copies each track into a separate
file.</p>

<p>-w --wait waits for signal, then start recording.</p>

<p>-F --find-extremes finds extreme amplitudes in
samples.</p>

<p>-G --find-mono finds if input samples are in mono.</p>

<p>-T --deemphasize undo the effect of pre-emphasis in the
input samples.</p>

<p>-e --echo copies audio data to sound device e.g.
/dev/dsp.</p>

<p>-p percentage --set-pitch changes pitch of audio data
copied to sound device.</p>

<p>-v itemlist --verbose-level prints verbose information
about the CD. Level is a list of comma separated suboptions.
Each suboption controls the type of information to be
reported.</p>


<p>+----------+---------------------------------------------------+

debugging pur- poses).</p>

<p>-J --info-only does not write to a file, it just gives
information about the disc.</p>

<p>-L cddb mode --cddb does a cddbp album- and track title
lookup based on the cddb id. The parameter cddb mode defines
how multiple entries shall be handled.</p>

<p>+----------+------------------------------------------+
|Parameter | Description |
+----------+------------------------------------------+ | 0
| interactive mode. The user selects the | | | entry to use.
| +----------+------------------------------------------+ |
1 | first fit mode. The first entry is taken | | |
unconditionally. |
+----------+------------------------------------------+
cddbp-server=servername sets the server to be contacted for
title lookups.</p>

<p>cddbp-port=portnumber sets the port number to be used
for title lookups.</p>

<p>-H --no-infofile does not write an info file and a cddb
file.</p>

<p>-g --gui formats the output to be better parsable by gui
frontends.</p>

<p>-M count --md5 enables calculation of MD-5 checksum for
count bytes from a beginning of a track.</p>

<p>-S speed --speed sets the cdrom device to one of the
selectable speeds for read- ing.</p>

<p>-q --quiet quiet operation, no screen output.</p>

<p>-V --verbose-SCSI enable SCSI command logging to the
console. This is mainly used for debugging.</p>

<p>-Q --silent-SCSI suppress SCSI command error reports to
the console. This is mainly used for guis.</p>

<p>-scanbus Scan all SCSI devices on all SCSI busses and
print the inquiry strings. This option may be used to find
SCSI address of the CD/DVD-Recorder on a system. The numbers
printed out as labels are computed by: bus * 100 +
target</p>

<p>--devices Like -scanbus but works in a more native way,
respecting the device name specification on the current
operating system. See wodim(1) for details.</p>

<p>-paranoia use the paranoia library instead of icedax s
routines for read- ing.</p>

<p>-h --help display version of icedax on standard
output.</p>

<p>Defaults depend on the Makefile and environment variable
settings (currently CDDA_DEVICE ).</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES CDDA_DEVICE is used to set the
device name. The device naming is com- patible with the one
used by the wodim tool.</p>

<p>CDDBP_SERVER is used for cddbp title lookups when
supplied.</p>

<p>CDDBP_PORT is used for cddbp title lookups when
supplied.</p>

<p>RSH If the RSH environment variable is present, the
remote connec- tion will not be created via rcmd(3) but by
calling the program pointed to by RSH. Use e.g.
RSH=/usr/bin/ssh to create a secure shell connection.</p>

<p>Note that this forces icedax to create a pipe to the
rsh(1) pro- gram and disallows icedax to directly access the
network socket to the remote server. This makes it
impossible to set up per- formance parameters and slows down
the connection compared to a root initiated rcmd(3)
connection.</p>

<p>RSCSI If the RSCSI environment variable is present, the
remote SCSI server will not be the program
/opt/schily/sbin/rscsi but the program pointed to by RSCSI.
Note that the remote SCSI server program name will be
ignored if you log in using an account that has been created
with a remote SCSI server program as login shell.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUES icedax uses the following exit codes to
indicate various degrees of success:</p>


<p>+---------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
|Exitcode | Description |
+---------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| 0 | no errors encountered, successful operation. |
+---------+-----------------------------------------------------------+

DISCUSSION icedax is able to read parts of an audio CD or
multimedia CDROM (con- taining audio parts) directly
digitally. These parts can be written to a file, a pipe, or
to a sound device.</p>

<p>icedax stands for CDDA to WAV (where CDDA stands for
compact disc digi- tal audio and WAV is a sound sample
format introduced by MS Windows). It allows copying CDDA
audio data from the CDROM drive into a file in WAV or other
formats.</p>

<p>The latest versions try to get higher real-time
scheduling priorities to ensure smooth (uninterrupted)
operation. These priorities are avail- able for super users
and are higher than those of normal processes. Thus delays
are minimized.</p>

<p>If your CDROM is on device DEV and it is loaded with an
audio CD, you may simply invoke icedax dev=DEV and it will
create the sound file audio.wav recording the whole track
beginning with track 1 in stereo at 16 bit at 44100 Hz
sample rate, if your file system has enough space free.
Otherwise recording time will be limited. For details see
files README and README.INSTALL</p>

<p>HINTS ON OPTIONS Options Most of the options are used to
control the format of the WAV file. In the following text
all of them are described.</p>

<p>Select Device -D device selects the CDROM drive device
to be used. The speci- fier given should correspond to the
selected interface (see below). CHANGE! For the cooked_ioctl
interface this is the cdrom device descriptor as before. The
SCSI devices used with the generic SCSI interface however
are now addressed with their SCSI-Bus, SCSI-Id, and SCSI-Lun
instead of the generic SCSI device descriptor!!! One example
for a SCSI CDROM drive on bus 0 with SCSI ID 3 and lun 0 is
-D0,3,0.</p>

<p>Select Auxiliary device -A auxdevice is necessary for
CD-Extra handling. For Non-SCSI- CDROM drives this is the
same device as given by -D (see above). For SCSI-CDROM
drives it is the CDROM drive (SCSI) device (i.e. /dev/sr0 )
corresponding to the SCSI device (i.e. 0,3,0 ). It has to
match the device used for sampling.</p>

<p>Select Interface -I interface selects the CDROM drive
interface. For SCSI drives use generic_scsi (cooked_ioctl
may not yet be available for all devices): generic_scsi and
cooked_ioctl. The first uses the generic SCSI interface, the
latter uses the ioctl of the CDROM driver. The latter
variant works only when the kernel driver supports CDDA
reading. This entry has to match the selected CDROM device
(see above).</p>

<p>Enable echo to soundcard -e copies audio data to the
sound card while recording, so you hear it nearly
simultaneously. The soundcard gets the same data that is
recorded. This is time critical, so it works best with the
-q option. To use icedax as a pseudo CD player without
recording in a file you could use icedax -q -e -t2 -d0 -N to
play the whole second track. This feature reduces the
recording speed to at most onefold speed. You cannot make
better record- ings than your sound card can play (since the
same data is used).</p>

<p>Change pitch of echoed audio -p percentage changes the
pitch of all audio echoed to a sound card. Only the copy to
the soundcard is affected, the recorded audio samples in a
file remain the same. Normal pitch, which is the default, is
given by 100%. Lower percentages correspond to lower
pitches, i.e. -p 50 transposes the audio output one octave
lower. See also the script pitchplay as an example. This
option was contributed by Raul Sobon.</p>

<p>Select mono or stereo recording -m or -c 1 selects mono
recording (both stereo channels are mixed), -s or -c 2 or -c
s selects stereo recording. Parameter s will swap both sound
channels.</p>

<p>Select maximum quality -x will set stereo, 16 bits per
sample at 44.1 KHz (full CD quality). Note that other format
options given later can change this setting.</p>

<p>Select sample quality -b 8 specifies 8 bit (1 Byte) for
each sample in each channel; -b 12 specifies 12 bit (2 Byte)
for each sample in each channel; -b 16 specifies 16 bit (2
Byte) for each sample in each channel (Ensure that your
sample player or sound card is capable of playing 12-bit or
16-bit samples). Selecting 12 or 16 bits doubles file size.
12-bit samples are aligned to 16-bit sam- ples, so they
waste some disk space.</p>

<p>Select sample rate -r samplerate selects a sample rate.
samplerate can be in a range between 44100 and 900. Option
-R lists all available rates.</p>

<p>Select sample rate divider -a divider selects a sample
rate divider. divider can be mini- mally 1 and maximally
50.5 and everything between in steps of 0.5. Option -R lists
all available rates.</p>

<p>To make the sound smoother at lower sampling rates,
icedax sums over n samples (where n is the specific
dividend). So for 22050 Hertz output we have to sum over 2
samples, for 900 Hertz we have to sum over 49 samples. This
cancels higher frequencies. Standard sector size of an audio
CD (ignoring additional infor- mation) is 2352 Bytes. In
order to finish summing for an output sample at sector
boundaries the rates above have to be chosen. Arbitrary
sampling rates in high quality would require some
interpolation scheme, which needs much more sophisticated
pro- gramming.</p>

<p>List a table of all sampling rates -R shows a list of
all sample rates and their dividers. Dividers can range from
1 to 50.5 in steps of 0.5.</p>

<p>Select start track and optionally end track -t n+m
selects n as the start track and optionally m as the last
track of a range to be recorded. These tracks must be from
the table of contents. This sets the track where recording
begins. Recording can advance through the following tracks
as well (lim- ited by the optional end track or otherwise
depending on record- ing time). Whether one file or
different files are then created depends on the -B option
(see below).</p>

<p>Select start index -i n selects the index to start
recording with. Indices other than 1 will invoke the index
scanner, which will take some time to find the correct start
position. An offset may be given addi- tionally (see
below).</p>

<p>Set recording time -d n sets recording time to n seconds
or set recording time for whole track if n is zero. In order
to specify the duration in frames (sectors) also, the
argument can have an appended f. Then the numerical argument
is to be taken as frames (sectors) rather than seconds.
Please note that if track ranges are being used they define
the recording time as well thus overriding any -d option
specified times.</p>

<p>Recording time is defined as the time the generated
sample will play (at the defined sample rate). Since it s
related to the amount of generated samples, its not the time
of the sampling process itself (which can be less or more).
Its neither strictly coupled with the time information on
the audio CD (shown by your hifi CD player). Differences can
occur by the usage of the -o option (see below). Notice that
recording time will be shortened, unless enough disk space
exists. Recording can be aborted at anytime by pressing the
break character (sig- nal SIGQUIT). .IP &quot;Record all
tracks of a complete audio CD in separate files&quot; -B
copies each track into a separate file. A base name can be
given. File names have an appended track number and an
extension corresponding to the audio format. To record all
audio tracks of a CD, use a sufficient high duration (i.e.
-d99999).</p>

<p>Set start sector offset -o sectors increments start
sector of the track by sectors. By this option you are able
to skip a certain amount at the beginning of a track so you
can pick exactly the part you want. Each sector runs for
1/75 seconds, so you have very fine con- trol. If your
offset is so high that it would not fit into the current
track, a warning message is issued and the offset is
ignored. Recording time is not reduced. (To skip
introductory quiet passages automagically, use the -w option
see below.)</p>

<p>Wait for signal option -w Turning on this option will
suppress all silent output at startup, reducing possibly
file size. icedax will watch for any signal in the output
signal and switches on writing to file.</p>

<p>Find extreme samples -F Turning on this option will
display the most negative and the most positive sample value
found during recording for both chan- nels. This can be
useful for readjusting the volume. The values shown are not
reset at track boundaries, they cover the complete sampling
process. They are taken from the original samples and have
the same format (i.e. they are independent of the selected
output format).</p>

<p>Find if input samples are in mono -G If this option is
given, input samples for both channels will be compared. At
the end of the program the result is printed. Differences in
the channels indicate stereo, otherwise when both channels
are equal it will indicate mono.</p>

<p>Undo the pre-emphasis in the input samples -T Some older
audio CDs are recorded with a modified frequency response
called pre-emphasis. This is found mostly in classical
recordings. The correction can be seen in the flags of the
Table Of Contents often. But there are recordings, that show
this set- ting only in the subchannels. If this option is
given, the index scanner will be started, which reads the
q-subchannel of each track. If pre-emphasis is indicated in
the q-subchannel of a track, but not in the TOC,
pre-emphasis will be assumed to be present, and subsequently
a reverse filtering is done for this track before the
samples are written into the audio file.</p>

<p>Set audio format -O audiotype can be wav (for wav files)
or au or sun (for sun PCM files) or cdr or raw (for
headerless files to be used for cd writers). All file
samples are coded in linear pulse code modu- lation (as done
in the audio compact disc format). This holds for all audio
formats. Wav files are compatible to Wind*ws sound files,
they have lsb,msb byte order as being used on the audio cd.
The default filename extension is .wav. Sun type files are
not like the older common logarithmically coded .au files,
but instead as mentioned above linear PCM is used. The byte
order is msb,lsb to be compatible. The default filename
extension is .au. The AIFF and the newer variant AIFC from
the Apple/SGI world store their samples in bigendian format
(msb,lsb). In AIFC no compression is used. Finally the
easiest format, the cdr aka raw format. It is done per
default in msb,lsb byte order to satisfy the order wanted by
most cd writ- ers. Since there is no header information in
this format, the sample parameters can only be identified by
playing the samples on a soundcard or similar. The default
filename extension is .cdr or .raw.</p>

<p>Select cdrom drive reading speed -S speed allows to
switch the cdrom drive to a certain level of speed in order
to reduce read errors. The argument is transfered verbatim
to the drive. Details depend very much on the cdrom drives.
An argument of 0 for example is often the default speed of
the drive, a value of 1 often selects single speed.</p>

<p>Enable MD5 checksums -M count enables calculation of
MD-5 checksum for count bytes from the beginning of a track.
This was introduced for quick comparisons of tracks.</p>

<p>Use Montys libparanoia for reading of sectors -paranoia
selects an alternate way of extracting audio sectors. Monty
s library is used with the following default options:</p>

<p>PARANOIA_MODE_FULL, but without
PARANOIA_MODE_NEVERSKIP</p>

<p>for details see Montys libparanoia documentation. In
this case the option -P has no effect.</p>

<p>Do linear or overlapping reading of sectors (This
applies unless option -paranoia is used.) -P sectors sets
the given number of sectors for initial overlap sampling for
jitter correction. Two cases are to be distinguished. For
nonzero values, some sectors are read twice to enable
icedaxs jitter correction. If an argument of zero is given,
no overlap sampling will be used. For nonzero overlap
sectors icedax dynamically adjusts the setting during
sampling (like cdparanoia does). If no match can be found,
icedax retries the read with an increased overlap. If the
amount of jitter is lower than the current overlapped
samples, icedax reduces the overlap setting, resulting in a
higher reading speed. The argument given has to be lower
than the total number of sectors per request (see option -n
below). Icedax will check this setting and issues a error
message otherwise. The case of zero sectors is nice on low
load situations or errorfree (perfect) cdrom drives and per-
fect (not scratched) audio cds.</p>

<p>Set the transfer size -n sectors will set the transfer
size to the specified sectors per request.</p>

<p>Set number of ring buffer elements -l buffers will
allocate the specified number of ring buffer elements.</p>

<p>Set endianess of input samples -C endianess will
override the default settings of the input format. Endianess
can be set explicitly to &quot;little&quot; or
&quot;big&quot; or to the automatic endianess detection
based on voting with &quot;guess&quot;.</p>

<p>Set endianess of output samples -E endianess (endianess
can be &quot;little&quot; or &quot;big&quot;) will override
the default settings of the output format.</p>

<p>Verbose option -v itemlist prints more information. A
list allows selection of different information items.</p>

<p>disable keeps quiet</p>

<p>toc displays the table of contents</p>

<p>summary displays a summary of recording parameters</p>

<p>indices invokes the index scanner and displays start
positions of indices</p>

<p>catalog retrieves and displays a media catalog
number</p>

<p>trackid retrieves and displays international standard
recording codes</p>

<p>sectors displays track start positions in absolute
sector nota- tion</p>

<p>To combine several requests just list the suboptions
separated with commas.</p>

<p>The table of contents The display will show the table of
contents with number of tracks and total time (displayed in
mm:ss.hh format, mm=minutes, ss=seconds, hh=rounded 1/100
seconds). The following list dis- plays track number and
track time for each entry. The summary gives a line per
track describing the type of the track.</p>

<p>track preemphasis copypermitted tracktype chans</p>

<p>The track column holds the track number. preemphasis
shows if that track has been given a non linear frequency
response. NOTE: You can undo this effect with the -T option.
copy-permit- ted indicates if this track is allowed to copy.
tracktype can be data or audio. On multimedia CDs (except
hidden track CDs) both of them should be present. channels
is defined for audio tracks only. There can be two or four
channels.</p>

<p>No file output -N this debugging option switches off
writing to a file.</p>

<p>No infofile generation -H this option switches off
creation of an info file and a cddb file.</p>

<p>Generation of simple output for gui frontends -g this
option switches on simple line formatting, which is needed
to support gui frontends (like xcd-roast).</p>

<p>Verbose SCSI logging -V this option switches on logging
of SCSI commands. This will produce a lot of output (when
SCSI devices are being used). This is needed for debugging
purposes. The format is the same as being used with the
cdrecord program from Joerg Schilling or the wodim tool. See
there for details.</p>

<p>Quiet option -q suppresses all screen output except
error messages. That reduces cpu time resources.</p>

<p>Just show information option -J does not write a file,
it only prints information about the disc (depending on the
-v option). This is just for information purposes.</p>

<p>CDDBP support Lookup album and track titles option -L
cddbp mode Icedax tries to retrieve performer, album-, and
track titles from a cddbp server. The default server right
now is freedb.freedb.org. It is planned to have more control
over the server handling later. The parameter defines how
multiple entries are handled:</p>

<p>0 interactive mode, the user chooses one of the
entries.</p>

<p>1 take the first entry without asking.</p>

<p>Set server for title lookups cddbp-server servername
When using -L or --cddb, the server being contacted can be
set with this option.</p>

<p>Set portnumber for title lookups cddbp-port portnumber
When using -L or --cddb, the server port being contacted can
be set with this option.</p>

<p>HINTS ON USAGE Dont create samples you cannot read.
First check your sample player software and sound card
hardware. I experienced problems with very low sample rates
(stereo &lt;= 1575 Hz, mono &lt;= 3675 Hz) when trying to
play them with standard WAV players for sound blaster (maybe
they are not legal in WAV format). Most CD-Writers insist on
audio samples in a bigendian format. Now icedax supports the
-E endianess option to con- trol the endianess of the
written samples.</p>

<p>If your hardware is fast enough to run icedax
uninterrupted and your CD drive is one of the perfect ones,
you will gain speed when switching all overlap sampling off
with the -P 0 option. Further fine tuning can be done with
the -n sectors option. You can specify how much sectors
should be requested in one go.</p>

<p>Icedax supports pipes now. Use a filename of - to let
icedax output its samples to standard output.</p>

<p>Conversion to other sound formats can be done using the
sox program package (although the use of sox -x to change
the byte order of samples should be no more necessary; see
option -E to change the output byte- order).</p>

<p>If you want to sample more than one track into different
files in one run, this is currently possible with the -B
option. When recording time exceeds the track limit a new
file will be opened for the next track.</p>

<p>FILES Icedax can generate a lot of files for various
purposes.</p>

<p>Audio files:</p>

<p>There are audio files containing samples with default
extensions These files are not generated when option (-N) is
given. Multiple files may be written when the bulk copy
option (-B) is used. Individual file names can be given as
arguments. If the number of file names given is sufficient
to cover all included audio tracks, the file names will be
used verbatim. Otherwise, if there are less file names than
files needed to write the included tracks, the part of the
file name before the extension is extended with _dd where dd
represents the current track number.</p>

<p>Cddb and Cdindex files:</p>

<p>If icedax detects cd-extra or cd-text (album/track)
title information, then .cddb and .cdindex files are
generated unless suppressed by the option -H. They contain
suitable formatted entries for submission to audio cd track
title databases in the internet. The CDINDEX and CDDB(tm)
systems are currently supported. For more information please
visit www.musicbrainz.org and www.freedb.com.</p>

<p>Inf files:</p>

<p>The inf files are describing the sample files and the
part from the audio cd, it was taken from. They are a means
to transfer information to a cd burning program like wodim.
For example, if the original audio cd had pre-emphasis
enabled, and icedax -T did remove the pre-emphasis, then the
inf file has pre-emphasis not set (since the audio file does
not have it anymore), while the .cddb and the .cdindex have
pre-empha- sis set as the original does.</p>

copyrighted material by noncopyright holders. This program
may not be used to circumvent copy- rights. The user

<p>BUGS Generation of md5 checksums is currently
broken.</p>

<p>Performance may not be optimal on slower systems.</p>

<p>The index scanner may give timeouts.</p>

<p>The resampling (rate conversion code) uses polynomial
interpolation, which is not optimal.</p>

<p>Icedax should use threads.</p>

<p>Icedax currently cannot sample hidden audio tracks
(track 1 index 0).</p>

<p>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Thanks goto Project MODE
(http://www.mode.net/) and Fraunhofer Institut fuer
integrierte Schaltungen (FhG-IIS) (http://www.iis.fhg.de/)
for financial support. Plextor Europe and Ricoh Japan
provided cdrom disk drives and cd burners which helped a lot
to develop this software. Rammi has helped a lot with the
debugging and showed a lot of stamina when hearing 100 times
the first 16 seconds of the first track of the Krupps CD.

<p>This manpage describes the program implementation of
icedax as shipped by the cdrkit distribution. See
http://alioth.debian.org/projects/deb- burn/ for details. It
is a spinoff from the original program cdda2wav as
distributed in the cdrtools package [1]. However, the
cdrtools developers are not involved in the development of
this spinoff and therefore shall not be made responsible for
any problem caused by it. Do not try to get support for this
program by contacting the original authors.</p>
