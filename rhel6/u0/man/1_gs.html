<p>GS(1) Ghostscript GS(1)</p>

<p>NAME gs - Ghostscript (PostScript and PDF language
interpreter and pre- viewer)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS gs [ options ] [ files ] ... (Unix, VMS)
gswin32c [ options ] [ files ] ... (MS Windows) gswin32 [
options ] [ files ] ... (MS Windows 3.1) gsos2 [ options ] [
files ] ... (OS/2)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The gs (gswin32c, gswin32, gsos2) command
invokes Ghostscript, an interpreter of Adobe Systems
PostScript(tm) and Portable Document For- mat (PDF)
languages. gs reads &quot;files&quot; in sequence and
executes them as Ghostscript programs. After doing this, it
reads further input from the standard input stream (normally
the keyboard), interpreting each line separately. The
interpreter exits gracefully when it encounters the
&quot;quit&quot; command (either in a file or from the
keyboard), at end-of-file, or at an interrupt signal (such
as Control-C at the keyboard).</p>

<p>The interpreter recognizes many option switches, some of
which are described below. Please see the usage
documentation for complete infor- mation. Switches may
appear anywhere in the command line and apply to all files
thereafter. Invoking Ghostscript with the -h or -? switch
produces a message which shows several useful switches, all
the devices known to that executable, and the search path
for fonts; on Unix it also shows the location of detailed
documentation.</p>

<p>Ghostscript may be built to use many different output
devices. To see which devices your executable includes, run
&quot;gs -h&quot;. Unless you spec- ify a particular device,
Ghostscript normally opens the first one of those and
directs output to it, so if the first one in the list is the
one you want to use, just issue the command</p>

<p>gs myfile.ps</p>

<p>You can also check the set of available devices from
within Ghostscript: invoke Ghostscript and type</p>

<p>devicenames ==</p>

<p>but the first device on the resulting list may not be
the default device you determine with &quot;gs -h&quot;. To
specify &quot;AbcXyz&quot; as the initial output device,
include the switch</p>

<p>-sDEVICE=AbcXyz</p>

<p>For example, for output to an Epson printer you might
use the command</p>

<p>gs -sDEVICE=epson myfile.ps</p>

<p>The &quot;-sDEVICE=&quot; switch must precede the first
mention of a file to print, and only the switchs first use
has any effect.</p>

<p>Finally, you can specify a default device in the
environment variable GS_DEVICE. The order of precedence for
these alternatives from highest to lowest (Ghostscript uses
the device defined highest in the list) is:</p>

<p>Some devices can support different resolutions
(densities). To specify the resolution on such a printer,
use the &quot;-r&quot; switch:</p>

<p>gs -sDEVICE=&lt;device&gt;
-r&lt;xres&gt;x&lt;yres&gt;</p>

<p>For example, on a 9-pin Epson-compatible printer, you
get the lowest- density (fastest) mode with</p>

<p>gs -sDEVICE=epson -r60x72</p>

<p>and the highest-density (best output quality) mode
with</p>

<p>gs -sDEVICE=epson -r240x72.</p>

<p>If you select a printer as the output device,
Ghostscript also allows you to choose where Ghostscript
sends the output -- on Unix systems, usually to a temporary
file. To send the output to a file &quot;foo.xyz&quot;, use
the switch</p>

<p>-sOutputFile=foo.xyz</p>

<p>You might want to print each page separately. To do
this, send the output to a series of files &quot;foo1.xyz,
foo2.xyz, ...&quot; using the &quot;-sOut- putFile=&quot;
switch with &quot;%d&quot; in a filename template:</p>

<p>-sOutputFile=foo%d.xyz</p>

<p>Each resulting file receives one page of output, and the
files are num- bered in sequence. &quot;%d&quot; is a printf
format specification; you can also use a variant like
&quot;%02d&quot;.</p>

<p>On Unix and MS Windows systems you can also send output
to a pipe. For example, to pipe output to the
&quot;lpr&quot; command (which, on many Unix sys- tems,
directs it to a printer), use the option</p>

<p>-sOutputFile=%pipe%lpr</p>

<p>Note that the % characters need to be doubled on MS
Windows to avoid mangling by the command interpreter.</p>

<p>You can also send output to standard output:</p>

<p>-sOutputFile=- or -sOutputFile=%stdout%</p>

<p>In this case you must also use the -q switch, to prevent
Ghostscript from writing messages to standard output.</p>

<p>To select a specific paper size, use the command line
switch</p>

<p>-sPAPERSIZE=&lt;paper_size&gt;</p>

<p>for instance</p>

<p>-sPAPERSIZE=a4 or -sPAPERSIZE=legal</p>

<p>Most ISO and US paper sizes are recognized. See the
usage documentation for a full list, or the definitions in
the initialization file &quot;gs_statd.ps&quot;.</p>

<p>Ghostscript can do many things other than print or view
PostScript and PDF files. For example, if you want to know
the bounding box of a PostScript (or EPS) file, Ghostscript
provides a special &quot;device&quot; that just prints out
this information.</p>

<p>For example, using one of the example files distributed
with Ghostscript,</p>

<p>gs -sDEVICE=bbox golfer.ps</p>

<p>prints out</p>

<p>%%BoundingBox: 0 25 583 732 %%HiResBoundingBox: 0.808497
25.009496 582.994503 731.809445</p>

<p>OPTIONS -- filename arg1 ... Takes the next argument as
a file name as usual, but takes all remaining arguments
(even if they have the syntactic form of switches) and
defines the name &quot;ARGUMENTS&quot; in
&quot;userdict&quot; (not &quot;systemdict&quot;) as an
array of those strings, before running the file. When
Ghostscript finishes executing the file, it exits back to
the shell.</p>

<p>-Dname=token -dname=token Define a name in
&quot;systemdict&quot; with the given definition. The token
must be exactly one token (as defined by the
&quot;token&quot; oper- ator) and may contain no
whitespace.</p>

<p>-Dname -dname Define a name in &quot;systemdict&quot;
with value=null.</p>

<p>-Sname=string -sname=string Define a name in
&quot;systemdict&quot; with a given string as value. This is
different from -d. For example, -dname=35 is equivalent to
the program fragment /name 35 def whereas -sname=35 is
equivalent to /name (35) def</p>

<p>-q Quiet startup: suppress normal startup messages, and
also do the equivalent of -dQUIET.</p>

<p>-gnumber1xnumber2 Equivalent to -dDEVICEWIDTH=number1
and -dDEVICEHEIGHT=number2. This is for the benefit of
devices (such as X11 windows) that require (or allow) width
and height to be specified.</p>

<p>-rnumber -rnumber1xnumber2 Equivalent to
-dDEVICEXRESOLUTION=number1 and -dDEVICEYRESOLU-
TION=number2. This is for the benefit of devices such as
print- ers that support multiple X and Y resolutions. If
only one num- ber is given, it is used for both X and Y
resolutions.</p>

<p>-Idirectories Adds the designated list of directories at
the head of the search path for library files.</p>

<p>- This is not really a switch, but indicates to
Ghostscript that standard input is coming from a file or a
pipe and not interac- tively from the command line.
Ghostscript reads from standard input until it reaches
end-of-file, executing it like any other file, and then
continues with processing the command line. When the command
line has been entirely processed, Ghostscript exits rather
than going into its interactive mode.</p>

<p>Note that the normal initialization file
&quot;gs_init.ps&quot; makes &quot;system- dict&quot;
read-only, so the values of names defined with -D, -d, -S,
or -s cannot be changed (although, of course, they can be
superseded by defi- nitions in &quot;userdict&quot; or other
dictionaries.)</p>

<p>SPECIAL NAMES -dDISKFONTS Causes individual character
outlines to be loaded from the disk the first time they are
encountered. (Normally Ghostscript loads all the character
outlines when it loads a font.) This may allow loading more
fonts into RAM, at the expense of slower rendering.</p>

<p>-dNOCACHE Disables character caching. Useful only for
debugging.</p>

<p>-dNOBIND Disables the &quot;bind&quot; operator. Useful
only for debugging.</p>

<p>-dNODISPLAY Suppresses the normal initialization of the
output device. This may be useful when debugging.</p>

<p>-dNOPAUSE Disables the prompt and pause at the end of
each page. This may be desirable for applications where
another program is driving Ghostscript.</p>

<p>-dNOPLATFONTS Disables the use of fonts supplied by the
underlying platform (for instance X Windows). This may be
needed if the platform fonts look undesirably different from
the scalable fonts.</p>

<p>-dSAFER Disables the &quot;deletefile&quot; and
&quot;renamefile&quot; operators and the ability to open
files in any mode other than read-only. This strongly
recommended for spoolers, conversion scripts or other
sensitive environments where a badly written or malicious
PostScript program code must be prevented from changing
impor- tant files.</p>

<p>-dWRITESYSTEMDICT Leaves &quot;systemdict&quot;
writable. This is necessary when running special utility
programs such as font2c and pcharstr, which must bypass
normal PostScript access protection.</p>

<p>-sDEVICE=device Selects an alternate initial output
device, as described above.</p>

<p>-sOutputFile=filename Selects an alternate output file
(or pipe) for the initial out- put device, as described
above.</p>

<p>FILES The locations of many Ghostscript run-time files
are compiled into the executable when it is built. On Unix
these are typically based in /usr/local, but this may be
different on your system. Under DOS they are typically based
in CGS, but may be elsewhere, especially if you install
Ghostscript with GSview. Run &quot;gs -h&quot; to find the
location of Ghostscript documentation on your system, from
which you can get more details.</p>

<p>/usr/local/share/ghostscript/#.##/* Startup files,
utilities, and basic font definitions</p>

<p>/usr/local/share/ghostscript/fonts/* More font
definitions</p>

<p>/usr/local/share/ghostscript/#.##/examples/* Ghostscript
demonstration files</p>

<p>/usr/local/share/ghostscript/#.##/doc/* Diverse document
files</p>

<p>INITIALIZATION FILES When looking for the initialization
files &quot;gs_*.ps&quot;, the files related to fonts, or
the file for the &quot;run&quot; operator, Ghostscript first
tries to open the file with the name as given, using the
current working directory if no directory is specified. If
this fails, and the file name doesn t specify an explicit
directory or drive (for instance, doesnt contain
&quot;/&quot; on Unix systems or &quot; Ghostscript tries
directories in this order:</p>

<p>1. the directories specified by the -I switches in the
command line (see below), if any;</p>

<p>2. the directories specified by the GS_LIB environment
variable, if any;</p>

<p>3. the directories specified by the GS_LIB_DEFAULT macro
in the Ghostscript makefile when the executable was built.
When gs is built on Unix, GS_LIB_DEFAULT is usually
&quot;/usr/local/share/ghostscript/#.##:/usr/local/share/ghostscript/fonts&quot;
where &quot;#.##&quot; represents the Ghostscript version
number.</p>

<p>Each of these (GS_LIB_DEFAULT, GS_LIB, and -I parameter)
may be either a single directory or a list of directories
separated by &quot;:&quot;.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT GS_OPTIONS String of options to be processed
before the command line options</p>

<p>GS_DEVICE Used to specify an output device</p>

<p>GS_FONTPATH Path names used to search for fonts</p>

<p>GS_LIB Path names for initialization files and fonts</p>

<p>TEMP Where temporary files are made</p>

<p>X RESOURCES Ghostscript, or more properly the X11
display device, looks for the following resources under the
program name &quot;Ghostscript&quot;:</p>

<p>borderWidth The border width in pixels (default =
1).</p>

<p>borderColor The name of the border color (default =
black).</p>

<p>geometry The window size and placement, WxH+X+Y (default
is NULL).</p>

<p>xResolution The number of x pixels per inch (default is
computed from WidthOfScreen and WidthMMOfScreen).</p>

<p>yResolution The number of y pixels per inch (default is
computed from HeightOfScreen and HeightMMOfScreen).</p>

<p>useBackingPixmap Determines whether backing store is to
be used for saving dis- play window (default = true).</p>

<p>See the usage document for a more complete list of
resources. To set these resources on Unix, put them in a
file such as &quot;~/.Xresources&quot; in the following
form:</p>

<p>Ghostscript*geometry: 612x792-0+0
Ghostscript*xResolution: 72 Ghostscript*yResolution: 72</p>

<p>Then merge these resources into the X servers resource
database:</p>

<p>% xrdb -merge ~/.Xresources</p>
