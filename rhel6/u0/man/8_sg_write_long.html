<p>SG_WRITE_LONG(8) SG3_UTILS SG_WRITE_LONG(8)</p>

<p>NAME sg_write_long - send the SCSI WRITE LONG
command</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sg_write_long [--16] [--cor_dis] [--help]
[--in=IF] [--lba=LBA] [--pblock] [--verbose] [--version]
[--wr_uncor] [--xfer_len=BTL] DEVICE</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Send the SCSI WRITE LONG (10 or 16 byte)
command to DEVICE. The buffer to be written to the DEVICE is
filled with 0xff bytes or read from the IF file. This buffer
includes the logical data (e.g. 512 bytes) and the ECC
bytes.</p>

<p>This utility can be used to generate a MEDIUM ERROR at a
specific logi- cal block address. This can be useful for
testing error handling. Prior to such a test, the sg_dd
utility could be used to copy the original contents of the
logical block address to some safe location. After the test
the sg_dd utility could be used to write back the original
con- tents of the logical block address. An alternate
strategy would be to read the &quot;long&quot; contents of
the logical block address with sg_read_long utility prior to
testing and restore it with this utility after test-
ing.</p>

<p>Take care: If recoverable errors are being injected
(e.g. only one or a few bits changed so that the ECC is able
to correct the data) then care should be taken with the
settings in the &quot;read write error recovery&quot; mode
page. Specifically if the ARRE (for reads) and/or AWRE (for
writes) are set then recovered errors will cause the lba to
be reas- signed (and the old location to be added to the
grown defect list (PLIST)). This is not easily reversed and
uses (one of the finite num- ber of) the spare sectors set
aside for this purpose. If in doubt it is probably safest to
clear the ARRE and AWRE bits. These bits can be checked and
modified with the sdparm utility. For example: &quot;sdparm
-c AWRE,ARRE /dev/sda&quot; will clear the bits until the
disk is power cycled.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Arguments to long options are mandatory for
short options as well.</p>

<p>-S, --16 send a SCSI WRITE LONG (16) command to DEVICE.
The default action (in the absence of this option) is to
send a SCSI WRITE LONG (10) command.</p>

<p>-c, --cor_dis sets the correction disabled (i.e COR_DIS)
bit. This inhibits various other mechanisms such as
automatic block reallocation, error recovery and various
informational exception conditions being triggered. This bit
is relatively new in SBC-3 .</p>

<p>-h, --help output the usage message then exit.</p>

<p>-i, --in=IF read data (binary) from file named IF and
use it for the SCSI WRITE LONG command. If IF is
&quot;-&quot; then stdin is read. If this option is not
given then 0xff bytes are used as fill.</p>

<p>-l, --lba=LBA where LBA is the logical block address of
the sector to over- write. Defaults to lba 0 which is a
dangerous block to over- write on a disk that is in use.
Assumed to be in decimal unless prefixed with 0x or has a
trailing h. If LBA is larger than can fit in 32 bits then
the --16 option should be used.</p>

<p>-p, --pblock sets the physical block (i.e PBLOCK) bit.
This instructs DEVICE to use the given data (unless
--wr_uncor is also given) to write to the physical block
specified by LBA. The default action is to write to the
logical block corresponding to the given lba. This bit is
relatively new in SBC-3 .</p>

<p>-v, --verbose increase the degree of verbosity (debug
messages).</p>

<p>-V, --version output version string then exit.</p>

<p>-w, --wr_uncor sets the &quot;write uncorrected&quot;
(i.e WR_UNCOR ) bit. This instructs the DEVICE to flag the
given lba (or the physical block that contains it if
--pblock is also given) as having an unrecoverable error
associated with it. Note: no data is trans- ferred to
DEVICE, other than the command (i.e. the cdb). In the
absence of this option, the default action is to use the
pro- vided data or 0xff bytes (--xfer_len=BTL in length) and
write it to DEVICE. This bit is relatively new in SBC-3
.</p>

<p>-x, --xfer_len=BTL where BTL is the byte transfer length
(default to 520). If the given value (or the default) does
not match the &quot;long&quot; block size of the device,
nothing is written to DEVICE and the appro- priate xfer_len
value may be deduced from the error response which is
printed (to stderr).</p>

<p>NOTES Various numeric arguments (e.g. LBA) may include
multiplicative suf- fixes or be given in hexadecimal. See
the &quot;NUMERIC ARGUMENTS&quot; section in the
sg3_utils(8) man page.</p>

<p>The 10 byte SCSI WRITE LONG command limits the logical
block address to a 32 bit quantity. For larger LBAs use the
--16 option for the SCSI WRITE LONG (16) command.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES This section outlines setting up a block with
corrupted data, checking the error condition, then restoring
useful contents to that sector.</p>

<p>First, if the data in a sector is important, save it
with the sg_read_long utility:</p>

<p>sg_read_long --lba=0x1234 --out=0x1234_1.img -x BTL
/dev/sda</p>

<p>This utility may need to be executed several time in
order to determine what the correct value for BTL is. Next
use this utility to &quot;corrupt&quot; that sector. That
might be done with:</p>

<p>sg_write_long --lba=0x1234 -x BTL /dev/sda</p>

<p>This will write a sector (and ECC data) of 0xff bytes.
Some disks may reject this (at least one of the author s
does). Another approach is to copy the 0x1234_1.img file (to
0x1234_2.img in this example) and change some values with a
hex editor. Then write the changed image with:</p>

<p>sg_write_long --lba=0x1234 --in=0x1234_2.img -x BTL
/dev/sda</p>

<p>Yet another approach is to use the --wr_uncor option, if
supported:</p>

<p>sg_write_long --lba=0x1234 --wr_uncor /dev/sda</p>

<p>Next we use the sg_dd utility to check that the sector
is corrupted. Here is an example:</p>

<p>sg_dd if=/dev/sda blk_sgio=1 skip=0x1234 of=. bs=512
count=1 ver- bose=4</p>

<p>Notice that the &quot;blk_sgio=1&quot; option is given.
This is to make sure that the sector is read (and no others)
and the error is fully reported. The &quot;blk_sgio=1&quot;
option causes the SG_IO ioctl to be used by sg_dd rather
than the block subsystem.</p>

<p>Finally we should restore sector 0x1234 to a
non-corrupted state. A sector full of zeroes could be
written with:</p>

<p>sg_dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda blk_sgio=1 seek=0x1234
bs=512 count=1</p>

<p>This will result in a sector (block) with 512 bytes of
0x0 without a MEDIUM ERROR since the ECC and associated data
will be regenerated and thus well formed. The blk_sgio=1
option is even more important in this case as it may stop
the block subsystem doing a read before write (since the
read will most likely fail). Another approach is to write
back the original contents:</p>

<p>sg_write_long --lba=0x1234 --in=0x1234_1.img -x BTL
/dev/sda</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The exit status of sg_write_long is 0 when
it is successful. Otherwise see the sg3_utils(8) man
page.</p>
