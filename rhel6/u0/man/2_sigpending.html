<p>NAME sigpending - examine pending signals</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;signal.h&gt;</p>

<p>int sigpending(sigset_t *set);</p>

<p>Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
feature_test_macros(7)):</p>

<p>sigpending(): _POSIX_C_SOURCE &gt;= 1 || _XOPEN_SOURCE
|| _POSIX_SOURCE</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION sigpending() returns the set of signals that
are pending for delivery to the calling thread (i.e., the
signals which have been raised while blocked). The mask of
pending signals is returned in set.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE sigpending() returns 0 on success and -1 on
error.</p>

<p>ERRORS EFAULT set points to memory which is not a valid
part of the process address space.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>NOTES See sigsetops(3) for details on manipulating
signal sets.</p>

<p>The set of signals that is pending for a thread is the
union of the set of signals that is pending for that thread
and the set of signals that is pending for the process as a
whole; see signal(7).</p>

<p>A child created via fork(2) initially has an empty
pending signal set; the pending signal set is preserved
across an execve(2).</p>

<p>BUGS In versions of glibc up to and including 2.2.1,
there is a bug in the wrapper function for sigpending()
which means that information about pending real-time signals
is not correctly returned.</p>

sigprocmask(2), sigsuspend(2), sigse- tops(3), signal(7)</p>
