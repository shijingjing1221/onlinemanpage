<p>LP(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual LP(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME lp - send files to a printer</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS lp [-c][-d dest][-n copies][-msw][-o option]...
[-t title][file...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The lp utility shall copy the input files to
an output destination in an unspecified manner. The default
output destination should be to a hardcopy device, such as a
printer or microfilm recorder, that produces non-volatile,
human-readable documents. If such a device is not avail-
able to the application, or if the system provides no such
device, the lp utility shall exit with a non-zero exit
status.</p>

<p>The actual writing to the output device may occur some
time after the lp utility successfully exits. During the
portion of the writing that corresponds to each input file,
the implementation shall guarantee exclusive access to the
device.</p>

<p>The lp utility shall associate a unique request ID with
each request.</p>

<p>Normally, a banner page is produced to separate and
identify each print job. This page may be suppressed by
implementation-defined conditions, such as an operator
command or one of the -o option values.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The lp utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>The following options shall be supported:</p>

<p>-c Exit only after further access to any of the input
files is no longer required. The application can then safely
delete or mod- ify the files without affecting the output
operation. Normally, files are not copied, but are linked
whenever possible. If the -c option is not given, then the
user should be careful not to remove any of the files before
the request has been printed in its entirety. It should also
be noted that in the absence of the -c option, any changes
made to the named files after the request is made but before
it is printed may be reflected in the printed output. On
some implementations, -c may be on by default.</p>

<p>-d dest Specify a string that names the destination (
dest). If dest is a printer, the request shall be printed
only on that specific printer. If dest is a class of
printers, the request shall be printed on the first
available printer that is a member of the class. Under
certain conditions (printer unavailability, file space
limitation, and so on), requests for specific destinations
need not be accepted. Destination names vary between
systems.</p>

<p>If -d is not specified, and neither the LPDEST nor
PRINTER environment variable is set, an unspecified
destination is used. The -d dest option shall take
precedence over LPDEST, which in turn shall take precedence
over PRINTER. Results are undefined when dest contains a
value that is not a valid destination name.</p>

<p>-m Send mail (see mailx ) after the files have been
printed. By default, no mail is sent upon normal completion
of the print request.</p>

<p>-n copies Write copies number of copies of the files,
where copies is a positive decimal integer. The methods for
producing multiple copies and for arranging the multiple
copies when multiple file operands are used are unspecified,
except that each file shall be output as an integral whole,
not interleaved with portions of other files.</p>

<p>-o option Specify printer-dependent or class-dependent
options. Several such options may be collected by specifying
the -o option more than once.</p>

<p>-s Suppress messages from lp.</p>

<p>-t title Write title on the banner page of the
output.</p>

<p>-w Write a message on the user s terminal after the
files have been printed. If the user is not logged in, then
mail shall be sent instead.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p>file A pathname of a file to be output. If no file
operands are spec- ified, or if a file operand is, the
standard input shall be used. If a file operand is used, but
the -c option is not speci- fied, the process performing the
writing to the output device may have user and group
permissions that differ from that of the process invoking
lp.</p>

<p>STDIN The standard input shall be used only if no file
operands are speci- fied, or if a file operand is- . See the
INPUT FILES section.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES The input files shall be text files.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of lp:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments
and input files).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error and informative messages written
to standard output.</p>

<p>LC_TIME Determine the format and contents of date and
time strings dis- played in the lp banner page, if any.</p>

<p>LPDEST Determine the destination. If the LPDEST
environment variable is not set, the PRINTER environment
variable shall be used. The -d dest option takes precedence
over LPDEST . Results are undefined when -d is not specified
and LPDEST contains a value that is not a valid destination
name.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>PRINTER Determine the output device or destination. If
the LPDEST and PRINTER environment variables are not set, an
unspecified output device is used. The -d dest option and
the LPDEST environment variable shall take precedence over
PRINTER. Results are unde- fined when -d is not specified,
LPDEST is unset, and PRINTER contains a value that is not a
valid device or destination name.</p>

<p>TZ Determine the timezone used to calculate date and
time strings displayed in the lp banner page, if any. If TZ
is unset or null, an unspecified default timezone shall be
used.</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT The lp utility shall write a request ID to the
standard output, unless -s is specified. The format of the
message is unspecified. The request ID can be used on
systems supporting the historical cancel and lpstat
utilities.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 All input files were processed successfully.</p>

<p>&gt;0 No output device was available, or an error
occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The pr and fold utilities can be used
to achieve reasonable formatting for the implementations
default page size.</p>

<p>A conforming application can use one of the file
operands only with the -c option or if the file is publicly
readable and guaranteed to be available at the time of
printing. This is because IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 gives the
implementation the freedom to queue up the request for
print- ing at some later time by a different process that
might not be able to access the file.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES 1. To print file file:</p>

<p>lp -c file</p>

<p>2. To print multiple files with headers:</p>

<p>pr file1 file2 | lp</p>

<p>RATIONALE The lp utility was designed to be a basic
version of a utility that is already available in many
historical implementations. The standard developers
considered that it should be implementable simply as:</p>

<p>cat &quot;$@&quot; &gt; /dev/lp</p>

<p>after appropriate processing of options, if that is how
the implementa- tion chose to do it and if exclusive access
could be granted (so that two users did not write to the
device simultaneously). Although in the future the standard
developers may add other options to this utility, it should
always be able to execute with no options or operands and
send the standard input to an unspecified output device.</p>

<p>This volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 makes no
representations concerning the format of the printed output,
except that it must be &quot;human-read- able&quot; and
&quot;non-volatile&quot;. Thus, writing by default to a disk
or tape drive or a display terminal would not qualify. (Such
destinations are not prohibited when -d dest, LPDEST, or
PRINTER are used, however.)</p>

<p>This volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 is worded such that
a &quot;print job&quot; consisting of multiple input files,
possibly in multiple copies, is guaranteed to print so that
any one file is not intermixed with another, but there is no
statement that all the files or copies have to print out
together.</p>

<p>The -c option may imply a spooling operation, but this
is not required. The utility can be implemented to wait
until the printer is ready and then wait until it is
finished. Because of that, there is no attempt to define a
queuing mechanism (priorities, classes of output, and so
on).</p>

<p>On some historical systems, the request ID reported on
the STDOUT can be used to later cancel or find the status of
a request using utilities not defined in this volume of IEEE
Std 1003.1-2001.</p>

<p>Although the historical System V lp and BSD lpr
utilities have provided similar functionality, they used
different names for the environment variable specifying the
destination printer. Since the name of the utility here is
lp, LPDEST (used by the System V lp utility) was given
precedence over PRINTER (used by the BSD lpr utility). Since
environ- ments of users frequently contain one or the other
environment vari- able, the lp utility is required to
recognize both. If this was not done, many applications
would send output to unexpected output devices when users
moved from system to system.</p>

<p>Some have commented that lp has far too little
functionality to make it worthwhile. Requests have proposed
additional options or operands or both that added
functionality. The requests included:</p>

<p>* Wording requiring the output to be
&quot;hardcopy&quot;</p>

<p>* A requirement for multiple printers</p>

<p>* Options for supporting various page-description
languages</p>

<p>Given that a compliant system is not required to even
have a printer, placing further restrictions upon the
behavior of the printer is not useful. Since hardcopy format
is so application-dependent, it is diffi- cult, if not
impossible, to select a reasonable subset of functionality
that should be required on all compliant systems.</p>

<p>The term unspecified is used in this section in lieu of
implementation- defined as most known implementations would
not be able to make defini- tive statements in their
conformance documents; the existence and usage of printers
is very dependent on how the system administrator config-
ures each individual system.</p>

<p>Since the default destination, device type, queuing
mechanisms, and acceptable forms of input are all
unspecified, usage guidelines for what a conforming
application can do are as follows:</p>

<p>* Use the command in a pipeline, or with -c, so that
there are no per- mission problems and the files can be
safely deleted or modified.</p>

<p>* Limit output to text files of reasonable line lengths
and printable characters and include no device-specific
formatting information, such as a page description language.
The meaning of &quot;reasonable&quot; in this context can
only be answered as a quality-of-implementation issue, but
it should be apparent from historical usage patterns in the
industry and the locale. The pr and fold utilities can be
used to achieve reasonable formatting for the default page
size of the implementation.</p>

<p>Alternatively, the application can arrange its
installation in such a way that it requires the system
administrator or operator to provide the appropriate
information on lp options and environment variable val-
ues.</p>

<p>At a minimum, having this utility in this volume of IEEE
Std 1003.1-2001 tells the industry that conforming
applications require a means to print output and provides at
least a command name and LPDEST routing mechanism that can
be used for discussions between vendors, application
writers, and users. The use of &quot;should&quot; in the
DESCRIPTION of lp clearly shows the intent of the standard
developers, even if they cannot mandate that all systems
(such as laptops) have printers.</p>

<p>This volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 does not specify
what the ownership of the process performing the writing to
the output device may be. If -c is not used, it is
unspecified whether the process performing the writing to
the output device has permission to read file if there are
any restrictions in place on who may read file until after
it is printed. Also, if -c is not used, the results of
deleting file before it is printed are unspecified.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
