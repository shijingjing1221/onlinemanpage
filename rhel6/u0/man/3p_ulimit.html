<p>ULIMIT(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual ULIMIT(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME ulimit - get and set process limits</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;ulimit.h&gt;</p>

<p>long ulimit(int cmd, ...);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The ulimit() function shall control process
limits. The process limits that can be controlled by this
function include the maximum size of a single file that can
be written (this is equivalent to using setr- limit() with
RLIMIT_FSIZE). The cmd values, defined in &lt;ulimit.h&gt;,
include:</p>

<p>UL_GETFSIZE Return the file size limit (RLIMIT_FSIZE) of
the process. The limit shall be in units of 512-byte blocks
and shall be inher- ited by child processes. Files of any
size can be read. The return value shall be the integer part
of the soft file size limit divided by 512. If the result
cannot be represented as a long, the result is
unspecified.</p>

<p>UL_SETFSIZE Set the file size limit for output
operations of the process to the value of the second
argument, taken as a long, multiplied by 512. If the result
would overflow an rlim_t, the actual value set is
unspecified. Any process may decrease its own limit, but
only a process with appropriate privileges may increase the
limit. The return value shall be the integer part of the new
file size limit divided by 512.</p>

<p>The ulimit() function shall not change the setting of
errno if success- ful.</p>

<p>As all return values are permissible in a successful
situation, an application wishing to check for error
situations should set errno to 0, then call ulimit(), and,
if it returns -1, check to see if errno is non-zero.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, ulimit() shall
return the value of the requested limit. Otherwise, -1 shall
be returned and errno set to indi- cate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The ulimit() function shall fail and the limit
shall be unchanged if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The cmd argument is not valid.</p>

<p>EPERM A process not having appropriate privileges
attempts to increase its file size limit.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
