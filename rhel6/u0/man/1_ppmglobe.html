<p>NAME ppmglobe - generate strips to glue onto a
sphere</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ppmglobe [-background=colorname] [-closeok]
stripcount [filename]</p>

<p>Minimum unique abbreviation of option is acceptable. You
may use dou- ble hyphens instead of single hyphen to denote
options. You may use white space in place of the equals sign
to separate an option name from its value.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>ppmglobe does the inverse of a cylindrical projection of
a sphere. Starting with a cylindrical projection, it
produces an image you can cut up and glue onto a sphere to
obtain the spherical image of which it is the cylindrical
projection.</p>

<p>What is a cylindrical projection? Imagine a map of the
Earth on flat paper. There are lots of different ways
cartographers show the three dimensional information in such
a two dimensional map. The cylindrical projection is one.
You could make a cylindrical projection by putting a light
inside a globe and wrapping a rectangular sheet of paper
around the globe, touching the globe at the Equator. Then
trace the image that the light projects onto the paper. Lay
the paper out flat and you have a cylindrical
projection.</p>

<p>Heres where ppmglobe comes in: Pass the image on that
paper through ppmglobe and what comes out the other side
looks something like this:</p>

<p>Example of map of the earth run through ppmglobe</p>

<p>You could cut out the strips and glue it onto a sphere
and youd have a copy of the original globe.</p>

<p>Note that cylindrical projections are not what you
normally see as maps of the Earth. You re more likely to see
a Mercator projection. In the Mercator projection, the Earth
gets stretched North-South as well as East-West as you move
away from the Equator. It was invented for use in
navigation, because you can draw straight compass courses on
it, but is used today because it is pretty.</p>

<p>You can find maps of planets at maps.jpl.nasa.gov .</p>

<p>PARAMETERS stripcount is the number of strips ppmglobe
is to generate in the out- put. More strips makes it easier
to fit onto a sphere (less stretch- ing, tearing, and
crumpling of paper), but makes you do more cutting out of
the strips.</p>

<p>The strips are all the same width. If the number of
columns of pixels in the image doesnt evenly divide by the
number of strips, ppmglobe truncates the image on the right
to create nothing but whole strips. In the pathological case
that there are fewer columns of pixels than the number of
strips you asked for, ppmglobe fails.</p>

<p>Before Netpbm 10.32 (February 2006), instead of
truncating the image on the right, ppmglobe produces a
fractional strip on the right.</p>

<p>filename is the name of the input file. If you dont
specify this, ppmglobe reads the image from Standard
Input.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -background=colorname This specifies the color
that goes between the strips.</p>

<p>Specify the color (color) as described for the argument
of the ppm_parsecolor() library routine .</p>

<p>The default is black.</p>

<p>This option was new in Netpbm 10.31 (December 2005).
Before that, the background is always black.</p>

<p>-closeok This means it is OK if the background isnt
exactly the color you specify. Sometimes, it is impossible
to represent a named color exactly due to the precision
(i.e. maxval) of the images color space. If you specify
-closeok and ppmglobe cant repre- sent the color you name
exactly, it will use instead the closest color to it that is
possible. If you don t specify closeok, ppmglobe fails in
that situation.</p>

<p>This option was new in Netpbm 10.31 (December 2005).</p>

<p>HISTORY ppmglobe was new in Netpbm 10.16 (June
2003).</p>

<p>It is derived from Max Gensthalers ppmglobemap.</p>

<p>AUTHORS Max Gensthaler wrote a program he called
ppmglobemap in June 2003 and suggested it for inclusion in
Netpbm. Bryan Henderson modified the code slightly and
included it in Netpbm as ppmglobe.</p>
