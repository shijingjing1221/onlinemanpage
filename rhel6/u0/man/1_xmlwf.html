<p>NAME xmlwf - Determines if an XML document is
well-formed</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS xmlwf [ -s] [ -n] [ -p] [ -x] [ -e encoding] [
-w] [ -d output- dir] [ -c] [ -m] [ -r] [ -t] [ -v] [ file
...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION xmlwf uses the Expat library to determine if
an XML document is well- formed. It is non-validating.</p>

<p>If you do not specify any files on the command-line, and
you have a recent version of xmlwf, the input file will be
read from standard input.</p>

<p>WELL-FORMED DOCUMENTS A well-formed document must adhere
to the following rules:</p>

<p>&middot; The file begins with an XML declaration. For
instance, &lt;?xml ver- sion=&quot;1.0&quot;
standalone=&quot;yes&quot;?&gt;. NOTE: xmlwf does not
currently check for a valid XML declaration.</p>

<p>&middot; Every start tag is either empty (&lt;tag/&gt;)
or has a corresponding end tag.</p>

<p>&middot; There is exactly one root element. This element
must contain all other elements in the document. Only
comments, white space, and pro- cessing instructions may
come after the close of the root element.</p>

<p>&middot; All elements nest properly.</p>

<p>&middot; All attribute values are enclosed in quotes
(either single or dou- ble).</p>

<p>If the document has a DTD, and it strictly complies with
that DTD, then the document is also considered valid. xmlwf
is a non-validating parser -- it does not check the DTD.
However, it does support external entities (see the -x
option).</p>

<p>OPTIONS When an option includes an argument, you may
specify the argument either separately (&quot;-d
output&quot;) or concatenated with the option
(&quot;-doutput&quot;). xmlwf supports both.</p>

<p>-c If the input file is well-formed and xmlwf doesnt
encounter any errors, the input file is simply copied to the
output directory unchanged. This implies no namespaces
(turns off -n) and requires -d to specify an output
file.</p>

<p>-d output-dir Specifies a directory to contain
transformed representations of the input files. By default,
-d outputs a canonical representa- tion (described below).
You can select different output formats using -c and -m.</p>

<p>The output filenames will be exactly the same as the
input file- names or &quot;STDIN&quot; if the input is
coming from standard input. Therefore, you must be careful
that the output file does not go into the same directory as
the input file. Otherwise, xmlwf will delete the input file
before it generates the output file (just like running cat
&lt; file &gt; file in most shells).</p>

<p>Two structurally equivalent XML documents have a
byte-for-byte identical canonical XML representation. Note
that ignorable white space is considered significant and is
treated equiva- lently to data. More on canonical XML can be
found at http://www.jclark.com/xml/canonxml.html .</p>

<p>-e encoding Specifies the character encoding for the
document, overriding any document encoding declaration.
xmlwf supports four built-in encodings: US-ASCII, UTF-8,
UTF-16, and ISO-8859-1. Also see the -w option.</p>

<p>-m Outputs some strange sort of XML file that completely
describes the input file, including character positions.
Requires -d to specify an output file.</p>

<p>-n Turns on namespace processing. (describe namespaces)
-c dis- ables namespaces.</p>

<p>-p Tells xmlwf to process external DTDs and parameter
entities.</p>

<p>Normally xmlwf never parses parameter entities. -p tells
it to always parse them. -p implies -x.</p>

<p>-r Normally xmlwf memory-maps the XML file before
parsing; this can result in faster parsing on many
platforms. -r turns off mem- ory-mapping and uses normal
file IO calls instead. Of course, memory-mapping is
automatically turned off when reading from standard
input.</p>

<p>Use of memory-mapping can cause some platforms to report
sub- stantially higher memory usage for xmlwf, but this
appears to be a matter of the operating system reporting
memory in a strange way; there is not a leak in xmlwf.</p>

<p>-s Prints an error if the document is not standalone. A
document is standalone if it has no external subset and no
references to parameter entities.</p>

<p>-t Turns on timings. This tells Expat to parse the
entire file, but not perform any processing. This gives a
fairly accurate idea of the raw speed of Expat itself
without client overhead. -t turns off most of the output
options (-d, -m, -c, ...).</p>

<p>-v Prints the version of the Expat library being used,
including some information on the compile-time configuration
of the library, and then exits.</p>

<p>-w Enables support for Windows code pages. Normally,
xmlwf will throw an error if it runs across an encoding that
it is not equipped to handle itself. With -w, xmlwf will try
to use a Windows code page. See also -e.</p>

<p>-x Turns on parsing external entities.</p>

<p>Non-validating parsers are not required to resolve
external entities, or even expand entities at all. Expat
always expands internal entities (?), but external entity
parsing must be enabled explicitly.</p>

<p>External entities are simply entities that obtain their
data from outside the XML file currently being parsed.</p>

<p>This is an example of an internal entity:</p>

<p>&lt;!ENTITY vers 1.0.2&gt;</p>

<p>And here are some examples of external entities:</p>

<p>&lt;!ENTITY header SYSTEM
&quot;header-&amp;vers;.xml&quot;&gt; (parsed) &lt;!ENTITY
logo SYSTEM &quot;logo.png&quot; PNG&gt; (unparsed)</p>

<p>-- (Two hyphens.) Terminates the list of options. This
is only needed if a filename starts with a hyphen. For
example:</p>

<p>xmlwf -- -myfile.xml</p>

<p>will run xmlwf on the file -myfile.xml.</p>

<p>Older versions of xmlwf do not support reading from
standard input.</p>

<p>OUTPUT If an input file is not well-formed, xmlwf prints
a single line describing the problem to standard output. If
a file is well formed, xmlwf outputs nothing. Note that the
result code is not set.</p>

<p>BUGS According to the W3C standard, an XML file without
a declaration at the beginning is not considered
well-formed. However, xmlwf allows this to pass.</p>

<p>xmlwf returns a 0 - noerr result, even if the file is
not well-formed. There is no good way for a program to use
xmlwf to quickly check a file -- it must parse xmlwfs
standard output.</p>

<p>The errors should go to standard error, not standard
output.</p>

<p>There should be a way to get -d to send its output to
standard output rather than forcing the user to send it to a
file.</p>

<p>I have no idea why anyone would want to use the -d, -c,
and -m options. If someone could explain it to me, Id like
to add this information to this manpage.</p>
