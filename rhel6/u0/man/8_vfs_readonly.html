<p>NAME vfs_readonly - make a Samba share read only for a
specified time period</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS vfs objects = readonly</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This VFS module is part of the samba(7)
suite.</p>

<p>The vfs_readonly VFS module marks a share as read only
for all clients connecting within the configured time
period. Clients connecting during this time will be denied
write access to all files in the share, irrespective of ther
actual access privileges.</p>

<p>This module is stackable.</p>

<p>OPTIONS readonly:period = BEGIN, END Only mark the share
as read only if the client connection was made between the
times marked by the BEGIN and END date specifiers. The
syntax of these date specifiers is the same as that accepted
by the -d option of GNU date(1).</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Mark all shares read only:</p>

<p>[global] vfs objects = readonly</p>

<p>Mark the [backup] share as read only during business
hours:</p>

<p>[backup] path = /readonly vfs objects = readonly
readonly:period = readonly:period = &quot;today
9:00&quot;,&quot;today 17:00&quot;</p>

<p>VERSION This man page is correct for version 3.0.25 of
the Samba suite.</p>

<p>AUTHOR The original Samba software and related utilities
were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by
the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way
the Linux kernel is developed.</p>
