<p>FSETPOS(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual FSETPOS(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME fsetpos - set current file position</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</p>

<p>int fsetpos(FILE *stream, const fpos_t *pos);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The fsetpos() function shall set the file
position and state indicators for the stream pointed to by
stream according to the value of the object pointed to by
pos, which the application shall ensure is a value obtained
from an earlier call to fgetpos() on the same stream. If a
read or write error occurs, the error indicator for the
stream shall be set and fsetpos() fails.</p>

<p>A successful call to the fsetpos() function shall clear
the end-of-file indicator for the stream and undo any
effects of ungetc() on the same stream. After an fsetpos()
call, the next operation on an update stream may be either
input or output.</p>

<p>The behavior of fsetpos() on devices which are incapable
of seeking is implementation-defined. The value of the file
offset associated with such a device is undefined.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The fsetpos() function shall return 0 if it
succeeds; otherwise, it shall return a non-zero value and
set errno to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The fsetpos() function shall fail if, either the
stream is unbuffered or the streams buffer needed to be
flushed, and the call to fsetpos() causes an underlying
lseek() or write() to be invoked, and:</p>

<p>EAGAIN The O_NONBLOCK flag is set for the file
descriptor and the pro- cess would be delayed in the write
operation.</p>

<p>EBADF The file descriptor underlying the stream file is
not open for writing or the streams buffer needed to be
flushed and the file is not open.</p>

<p>EFBIG An attempt was made to write a file that exceeds
the maximum file size.</p>

<p>EFBIG An attempt was made to write a file that exceeds
the process file size limit.</p>

<p>EFBIG The file is a regular file and an attempt was made
to write at or beyond the offset maximum associated with the
corresponding stream.</p>

<p>EINTR The write operation was terminated due to the
receipt of a sig- nal, and no data was transferred.</p>

<p>EIO A physical I/O error has occurred, or the process is
a member of a background process group attempting to perform
a write() to its controlling terminal, TOSTOP is set, the
process is neither ignoring nor blocking SIGTTOU, and the
process group of the pro- cess is orphaned. This error may
also be returned under imple- mentation-defined
conditions.</p>

<p>ENOSPC There was no free space remaining on the device
containing the file.</p>

<p>ENXIO A request was made of a nonexistent device, or the
request was outside the capabilities of the device.</p>

<p>EPIPE The file descriptor underlying stream is
associated with a pipe or FIFO.</p>

<p>EPIPE An attempt was made to write to a pipe or FIFO
that is not open for reading by any process; a SIGPIPE
signal shall also be sent to the thread.</p>
