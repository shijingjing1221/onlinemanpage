<p>NAME ppmspread - displace a PPM image s pixels by a
random amount</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ppmspread amount [ppmfile]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>ppmspread reads a PPM image as input and moves every
pixel around a random bit relative to its original position.
amount determines by how many pixels a pixel is to be moved
around at most.</p>

<p>Pictures processed with this filter will seem to be
somewhat dissolved or unfocussed (although they appear more
coarse than images processed by something like
pnmconvol).</p>

<p>The randomness in the image is limited before Netpbm
10.37 (December 2006) -- if you run the program twice in the
same second, you may get identical output.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO ppm(1), pnmconvol(1)</p>
