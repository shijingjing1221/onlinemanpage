<p>STRUCT USB_COMPOSITE(9) Kernel Mode Gadget API STRUCT
USB_COMPOSITE(9)</p>

<p>NAME struct_usb_composite_driver - groups configurations
into a gadget</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS struct usb_composite_driver { const char *
name; const struct usb_device_descriptor * dev; struct
usb_gadget_strings ** strings; int (* bind) (struct
usb_composite_dev *); int (* unbind) (struct
usb_composite_dev *); void (* suspend) (struct
usb_composite_dev *); void (* resume) (struct
usb_composite_dev *); };</p>

<p>MEMBERS name For diagnostics, identifies the driver.</p>

<p>dev Template descriptor for the device, including
default device identifiers.</p>

<p>strings tables of strings, keyed by identifiers assigned
during bind and language IDs provided in control
requests</p>

<p>bind (REQUIRED) Used to allocate resources that are
shared across the whole device, such as string IDs, and add
its configurations using usb_add_config(). This may fail by
returning a negative errno value; it should return zero on
successful initialization.</p>

<p>unbind Reverses bind(); called as a side effect of
unregistering this driver.</p>

<p>suspend Notifies when the host stops sending USB
traffic, after function notifications</p>

<p>resume Notifies configuration when the host restarts USB
traffic, before function notifications</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Devices default to reporting self powered
operation. Devices which rely on bus powered operation
should report this in their bind() method.</p>

<p>Before returning from bind, various fields in the
template descriptor may be overridden. These include the
idVendor/idProduct/bcdDevice values normally to bind the
appropriate host side driver, and the three strings
(iManufacturer, iProduct, iSerialNumber) normally used to
provide user meaningful device identifiers. (The strings
will not be defined unless they are defined in dev and
strings.) The correct ep0 maxpacket size is also reported,
as defined by the underlying controller driver.</p>
