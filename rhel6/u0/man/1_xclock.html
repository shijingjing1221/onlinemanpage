<p>NAME xclock - analog / digital clock for X</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS xclock [ -help ] [ -analog | -digital ] [
-brief ] [ -chime ] [ -hd color ] [ -hl color ] [ -update
seconds ] [ -strftime format ] [ -twelve | -twentyfour |
-utime ] [ -padding number ] [ -norender ] [ -render ] [
-sharp ] [ -face pattern ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The xclock program displays the time in
analog or digital form. The time is continuously updated at
a frequency which may be specified by the user.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Xclock accepts all of the standard X Toolkit
command line options along with the additional options
listed below:</p>

<p>-help This option indicates that a brief summary of the
allowed options should be printed on the standard error.</p>

<p>-analog This option indicates that a conventional 12
hour clock face with tick marks and hands should be used.
This is the default.</p>

<p>-digital or -d This option indicates that a 24 hour
digital clock should be used.</p>

<p>-brief This option indicates that the digital clock
should only dis- play the hours and minutes fields. The
default is to show the full time and date information.</p>

<p>-utime This option indicates that a digital clock should
display sec- onds since the Epoch (in format 970012340
seconds since Epoch instead of a standard 24-hour time.</p>

<p>-strftime format This option allows an strftime(3)
format string to be specified for the digital clocks
display.</p>

<p>-twelve This option indicates that a digital clock
should display the time in twelve hour format.</p>

<p>-twentyfour This option indicates that a digital clock
should display the time in twenty-four hour format. This is
the default when a digital clock is used.</p>

<p>-chime This option indicates that the clock should chime
once on the half hour and twice on the hour.</p>

<p>-hands color (or -hd color) This option specifies the
color of the hands on an analog clock. The default is black.
This option is effectively ignored when Xrender is in
use.</p>

<p>-highlight color (or -hl color) This option specifies
the color of the edges of the hands on an analog clock, and
is only useful on color displays. The default is black. This
option is effectively ignored when Xrender is in use.</p>

<p>-update seconds This option specifies the frequency in
seconds at which xclock should update its display. If the
clock is obscured and then exposed, it will be updated
immediately. A value of 30 seconds or less will enable a
second hand on an analog clock. The default is 60
seconds.</p>

<p>-padding number This option specifies the width in
pixels of the padding between the window border and clock
text or picture. The default is 10 on a digital clock and 8
on an analog clock.</p>

<p>-render This option tells xclock to use the Xrender
extension to draw an anti-aliased face. This is the default
if xclock has been compiled with Xrender support. Note that
the color selection options and resources used when Xrender
is in effect differ from the standard options.</p>

<p>-norender This option turns off the use of Xrender to
draw the clock.</p>

<p>-sharp This option tells xclock to use sharper edges
when drawn using the Xrender extension.</p>

<p>-face pattern This option specifies the font to use in
digital mode when the Xrender extension is used. Patterns
are specified using the fontconfig face format described in
the Font Names section of fonts.conf(5).</p>

<p>X DEFAULTS This program uses the Clock widget. It
understands all of the core resource names and classes as
well as:</p>

<p>width (class Width) Specifies the width of the clock.
The default for analog clocks is 164 pixels; the default for
digital clocks is what- ever is needed to hold the clock
when displayed in the chosen font.</p>

<p>height (class Height) Specifies the height of the clock.
The default for analog clocks is 164 pixels; the default for
digital clocks is what- ever is needed to hold the clock
when displayed in the chosen font.</p>

<p>update (class Interval) Specifies the frequency in
seconds at which the time should be redisplayed.</p>

<p>foreground (class Foreground) Specifies the color for
the tick marks. The default depends on whether reverseVideo
is specified. If reverseVideo is speci- fied the default is
lwhite, otherwise the default is black.</p>

<p>hands (class Foreground) Specifies the color of the
insides of the clock s hands. The default depends on whether
reverseVideo is specified. If reverseVideo is specified the
default is lwhite, otherwise the default is black. Note that
this resource is not used when Xrender is in effect.</p>

<p>highlight (class Foreground) Specifies the color used to
highlight the clock s hands. The default is depends on
whether reverseVideo is specified. If reverseVideo is
specified the default is lwhite, otherwise the default is
black. Note that this resource is not used when Xrender is
in effect.</p>

<p>analog (class Boolean) Specifies whether or not an
analog clock should be used instead of a digital one. The
default is True.</p>

<p>twentyfour (class Boolean) Specifies whether or not a
digital clock should display the time in twenty-four hour
format. The default is True.</p>

<p>chime (class Boolean) Specifies whether or not a bell
should be rung on the hour and half hour.</p>

<p>padding (class Margin) Specifies the amount of internal
padding in pixels to be used. The default is 8.</p>

<p>font (class Font) Specifies the font to be used for the
digital clock. Note that variable width fonts currently will
not always display cor- rectly. This font is only used when
Xrender is not in effect.</p>

<p>render (class Boolean) Specifies whether or not the
Xrender extension should be used for the display. The
default is True if xclock has been com- piled with Xrender
support.</p>

<p>When Xrender is in effect, the following additional
resources are understood:</p>

<p>face (class FaceName) Specify the pattern for the font
to be used for the digital clock when Xrender is used.
Patterns are specified using the fontconfig face format
described in the Font Names section of fonts.conf(5).</p>

<p>sharp (class Boolean) Specifies if sharp edges should be
used when rendering the clock. The default is False.</p>

<p>buffer (class Boolean) Specifies that the updates of the
image are drawn to a pixmap before copied into the window
instead drawing them into the window directly.</p>

<p>The defaults of the following color resources depend on
whether rever- seVideo is specified. If reverseVideo is
specified the default is lwhite, otherwise the default is
black.</p>

<p>hourColor (class Foreground) The color of the hour
hand.</p>

<p>minuteColor (class Foreground) The color of the minute
hand.</p>

<p>secondColor (class Foreground) The color of the second
hand.</p>

<p>majorColor (class Foreground) The color of the major
scale ticks (i. e. each five minutes).</p>

<p>minorColor (class Foreground) The color of the minor
scale ticks (between major ticks).</p>

<p>WIDGETS In order to specify resources, it is useful to
know the hierarchy of the widgets which compose xclock. In
the notation below, indentation indicates hierarchical
structure. The widget class name is given first, followed by
the widget instance name.</p>

<p>XClock xclock Clock clock</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT DISPLAY to get the default host and display
number.</p>

<p>XENVIRONMENT to get the name of a resource file that
overrides the global resources stored in the
RESOURCE_MANAGER property.</p>

<p>FILES /usr/share/X11/app-defaults/XClock specifies
required resources</p>

<p>SEE ALSO X(7), xrdb(1), time(3C), fonts.conf (5).</p>

<p>BUGS Xclock believes the system clock.</p>

<p>When in digital mode, the string should be centered
automatically.</p>
