<p>NAME wcsrtombs - convert a wide-character string to a
multibyte string</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;wchar.h&gt;</p>

<p>size_t wcsrtombs(char *dest, const wchar_t **src, size_t
len, mbstate_t *ps);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION If dest is not a NULL pointer, the
wcsrtombs() function converts the wide-character string *src
to a multibyte string starting at dest. At most len bytes
are written to dest. The shift state *ps is updated. The
conversion is effectively performed by repeatedly calling
wcr- tomb(dest, *src, ps), as long as this call succeeds,
and then incre- menting dest by the number of bytes written
and *src by one. The con- version can stop for three
reasons:</p>

<p>1. A wide character has been encountered that can not be
represented as a multibyte sequence (according to the
current locale). In this case *src is left pointing to the
invalid wide character, (size_t) -1 is returned, and errno
is set to EILSEQ.</p>

<p>2. The length limit forces a stop. In this case *src is
left pointing to the next wide character to be converted,
and the number of bytes written to dest is returned.</p>

<p>3. The wide-character string has been completely
converted, including the terminating L&rsquo; &rsquo; (which
has the side effect of bringing back *ps to the initial
state). In this case *src is set to NULL, and the num- ber
of bytes written to dest, excluding the terminating &rsquo;
&rsquo; byte, is returned.</p>

<p>If dest is NULL, len is ignored, and the conversion
proceeds as above, except that the converted bytes are not
written out to memory, and that no length limit exists.</p>

<p>In both of the above cases, if ps is a NULL pointer, a
static anonymous state only known to the wcsrtombs function
is used instead.</p>

<p>The programmer must ensure that there is room for at
least len bytes at dest.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The wcsrtombs() function returns the number
of bytes that make up the converted part of multibyte
sequence, not including the terminating null byte. If a wide
character was encountered which could not be con- verted,
(size_t) -1 is returned, and errno set to EILSEQ.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO C99.</p>

<p>NOTES The behavior of wcsrtombs() depends on the
LC_CTYPE category of the current locale.</p>

<p>Passing NULL as ps is not multithread safe.</p>
