<p>NAME mysql_setpermission - interactively set permissions
in grant tables</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS mysql_setpermission [options]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION mysql_setpermission is a Perl script that
was originally written and contributed by Luuk de Boer. It
interactively sets permissions in the MySQL grant tables.
mysql_setpermission is written in Perl and requires that the
DBI and DBD::mysql Perl modules be installed (see Section
2.15, Perl Installation Notes).</p>

<p>Invoke mysql_setpermission like this:</p>

<p>shell&gt; mysql_setpermission [options]</p>

<p>options should be either --help to display the help
message, or options that indicate how to connect to the
MySQL server. The account used when you connect determines
which permissions you have when attempting to modify
existing permissions in the grant tables.</p>

<p>mysql_setpermissions also reads options from the
[client] and [perl] groups in the .my.cnf file in your home
directory, if the file exists.</p>

<p>mysql_setpermission supports the following options:</p>

<p>&middot; --help</p>

<p>Display a help message and exit.</p>

<p>&middot; --host=host_name</p>

<p>Connect to the MySQL server on the given host.</p>

<p>&middot; --password=password</p>

<p>The password to use when connecting to the server. Note
that the password value is not optional for this option,
unlike for other MySQL programs.</p>

<p>Specifying a password on the command line should be
considered insecure. See Section 5.3.2.2, End-User
Guidelines for Password Security. You can use an option file
to avoid giving the password on the command line.</p>

<p>&middot; --port=port_num</p>

<p>The TCP/IP port number to use for the connection.</p>

<p>&middot; --socket=path</p>

<p>For connections to localhost, the Unix socket file to
use.</p>

<p>&middot; --user=user_name</p>

<p>The MySQL user name to use when connecting to the
server.</p>
