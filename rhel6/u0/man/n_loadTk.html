<p>NAME loadTk - Load Tk into a safe interpreter.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ::safe::loadTk slave ?-use windowId? ?-display
displayName?
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Safe Tk is based on Safe Tcl, which provides
a mechanism that allows restricted and mediated access to
auto-loading and packages for safe interpreters. Safe Tk
adds the ability to configure the interpreter for safe Tk
operations and load Tk into safe interpreters.</p>

<p>The ::safe::loadTk command initializes the required data
structures in the named safe interpreter and then loads Tk
into it. The interpreter must have been created with
::safe::interpCreate or have been initial- ized with
::safe::interpInit. The command returns the name of the safe
interpreter. If -use is specified, the window identified by
the speci- fied system dependent identifier windowId is used
to contain the . window of the safe interpreter; it can be
any valid id, eventually ref- erencing a window belonging to
another application. As a convenience, if the window you
plan to use is a Tk Window of the application you can use
the window name (e.g. .x.y) instead of its window Id ([winfo
id .x.y]). When -use is not specified, a new toplevel window
is created for the . window of the safe interpreter. On X11
if you want the embedded window to use another display than
the default one, specify it with -display. See the SECURITY
ISSUES section below for implementa- tion details.</p>

<p>SECURITY ISSUES Please read the safe manual page for Tcl
to learn about the basic secu- rity considerations for Safe
Tcl.</p>

<p>::safe::loadTk adds the value of tk_library taken from
the master interpreter to the virtual access path of the
safe interpreter so that auto-loading will work in the safe
interpreter.</p>

<p>Tk initialization is now safe with respect to not
trusting the slaves state for startup. ::safe::loadTk
registers the slave s name so when the Tk initialization
(Tk_SafeInit) is called and in turn calls the masters
::safe::InitTk it will return the desired argv equivalent
(-use windowId, correct -display, etc.)</p>

<p>When -use is not used, the new toplevel created is
specially decorated so the user is always aware that the
user interface presented comes from a potentially unsafe
code and can easily delete the corresponding
interpreter.</p>

<p>On X11, conflicting -use and -display are likely to
generate a fatal X error.</p>
