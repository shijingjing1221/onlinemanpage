<p>XdbeSwapBuffers(3) X FUNCTIONS XdbeSwapBuffers(3)</p>

<p>NAME XdbeSwapBuffers - swaps front and back DBE
buffers.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;X11/extensions/Xdbe.h&gt;</p>

<p>Status XdbeSwapBuffers( Display *dpy, XdbeSwapInfo
*swap_info, int num_windows)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This function swaps the front and back
buffers for a list of windows. The argument num_windows
specifies how many windows are to have their buffers
swapped; it is the number of elements in the swap_info
array. The argument swap_info specifies the information
needed per window to do the swap.</p>

<p>The XdbeSwapInfo structure has the following fields:</p>

<p>Window swap_window XdbeSwapAction swap_action</p>

<p>swap_window specifies the window for which to swap
buffers. swap_action specifies the swap action to use for
this swap_window.</p>

<p>swap_action determines what will happen to the new back
buffer of the swap_window it is paired with in the list in
addition to making the old back buffer become visible. The
defined actions are as follows:</p>

<p>XdbeUndefined The contents of the new back buffer become
undefined. This may be the most efficient action since it
allows the implementation to discard the contents of the
buffer if it needs to.</p>

<p>XdbeBackground The unobscured region of the new back
buffer will be tiled with the window background. The
background action allows devices to use a fast clear
capability during a swap.</p>

<p>XdbeUntouched The unobscured region of the new back
buffer will be unmodified by the swap.</p>

<p>XdbeCopied The unobscured region of the new back buffer
will be the con- tents of the old back buffer</p>

<p>ERRORS BadMatch A non-double-buffered window was
specified or a window was spec- ified twice.</p>

<p>BadWindow An invalid window was specified.</p>

<p>BadValue An invalid swap action was specified.</p>
