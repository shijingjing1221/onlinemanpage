<p>httpd_selinux(8) httpd Selinux Policy documentation
httpd_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME httpd_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for
the httpd daemon</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the httpd
server via flexible mandatory access control.</p>

<p>FILE_CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type. Policy governs the access
daemons have to these files. SELinux httpd policy is very
flexible allowing users to setup their web ser- vices in as
secure a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following file contexts types are defined for httpd:
httpd_sys_content_t - Set files with httpd_sys_content_t if
you want httpd_sys_script_exec_t scripts and the daemon to
read the file, and disallow other non sys scripts from
access. httpd_sys_script_exec_t - Set cgi scripts with
httpd_sys_script_exec_t to allow them to run with access to
all sys types. httpd_sys_content_rw_t - Set files with
httpd_sys_content_rw_t if you want httpd_sys_script_exec_t
scripts and the daemon to read/write the data, and disallow
other non sys scripts from access. httpd_sys_content_ra_t -
Set files with httpd_sys_content_ra_t if you want
httpd_sys_script_exec_t scripts and the daemon to
read/append to the file, and disallow other non sys scripts
from access. httpd_unconfined_script_exec_t - Set cgi
scripts with httpd_unconfined_script_exec_t to allow them to
run without any SELinux protection. This should only be used
for a very complex httpd scripts, after exhausting all other
options. It is bet- ter to use this script rather than
turning off SELinux protection for httpd.</p>

<p>NOTE With certain policies you can define additional
file contexts based on roles like user or staff.
httpd_user_script_exec_t can be defined where it would only
have access to &quot;user&quot; contexts.</p>

<p>SHARING FILES If you want to share files with multiple
domains (Apache, FTP, rsync, Samba), you can set a file
context of public_content_t and public_con- tent_rw_t. These
context allow any of the above domains to read the content.
If you want a particular domain to write to the public_con-
tent_rw_t domain, you must set the appropriate boolean.
allow_DOMAIN_anon_write. So for httpd you would execute:</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_httpd_anon_write=1</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_httpd_sys_script_anon_write=1</p>

<p>BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable based on least
access required. SElinux can be setup to prevent certain
http scripts from working. httpd pol- icy is extremely
flexible and has several booleans that allow you to
manipulate the policy and run httpd with the tightest access
possible.</p>

<p>httpd can be setup to allow cgi scripts to be executed,
set httpd_enable_cgi to allow this</p>

<p>setsebool -P httpd_enable_cgi 1</p>

<p>SELinux policy for httpd can be setup to not allowed to
access users home directories. If you want to allow access
to users home directo- ries you need to set the
httpd_enable_homedirs boolean and change the context of the
files that you want people to access off the home dir.</p>

<p>setsebool -P httpd_enable_homedirs 1 chcon -R -t
httpd_sys_content_t ~user/public_html</p>

<p>SELinux policy for httpd can be setup to not allow
access to the con- trolling terminal. In most cases this is
preferred, because an intruder might be able to use the
access to the terminal to gain privi- leges. But in certain
situations httpd needs to prompt for a password to open a
certificate file, in these cases, terminal access is
required. Set the httpd_tty_comm boolean to allow terminal
access.</p>

<p>setsebool -P httpd_tty_comm 1</p>

<p>httpd can be configured to not differentiate file
controls based on context, i.e. all files labeled as httpd
context can be read/write/exe- cute. Setting this boolean to
false allows you to setup the security policy such that one
httpd service can not interfere with another.</p>

<p>setsebool -P httpd_unified 0</p>

<p>SELinu policy for httpd can be configured to turn on
sending email. This is a security feature, since it would
prevent a vulnerabiltiy in http from causing a spam attack.
I certain situations, you may want http modules to send
mail. You can turn on the httpd_send_mail boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P httpd_can_sendmail 1</p>

<p>httpd can be configured to turn off internal scripting
(PHP). PHP and other loadable modules run under the same
context as httpd. Therefore several policy rules allow httpd
greater access to the system then is needed if you only use
external cgi scripts.</p>

<p>setsebool -P httpd_builtin_scripting 0</p>

<p>SELinux policy can be setup such that httpd scripts are
not allowed to connect out to the network. This would
prevent a hacker from breaking into you httpd server and
attacking other machines. If you need scripts to be able to
connect you can set the httpd_can_network_connect boolean
on.</p>

<p>setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect 1</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
