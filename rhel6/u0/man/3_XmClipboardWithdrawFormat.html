<p>NAME XmClipboardWithdrawFormat A clipboard function that
indicates that the application no longer wants to supply a
data item</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;Xm/CutPaste.h&gt; int
XmClipboardWithdrawFormat (display, window, data_id) Display
* display; Window window; long data_id; (void)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION XmClipboardWithdrawFormat indicates that the
application no longer sup- plies a data item to the
clipboard that the application had previously passed by
name.</p>

<p>display Specifies a pointer to the Display structure
that was returned in a previous call to XOpenDisplay or
XtDisplay.</p>

<p>window Specifies the window ID of a widget that relates
the applica- tion window to the clipboard. The widget s
window ID can be obtained through XtWindow. The same
application instance should pass the same window ID to each
clipboard function it calls.</p>

<p>data_id Specifies an identifying number assigned to the
data item, that uniquely identifies the data item and the
format. This was assigned to the item when it was originally
passed by XmClipboardCopy.</p>

<p>RETURN XmClipboardSuccess The function was
successful.</p>

<p>XmClipboardLocked The function failed because the
clipboard was locked by another application. The application
can continue to call the function again with the same
parameters until the lock goes away. This gives the
application the opportunity to ask if the user wants to keep
trying or to give up on the operation.</p>
