<p>NAME iotop - simple top-like I/O monitor</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS iotop [OPTIONS]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION iotop watches I/O usage information output
by the Linux kernel (requires 2.6.20 or later) and displays
a table of current I/O usage by processes or threads on the
system. At least the CONFIG_TASK_DELAY_ACCT and
CONFIG_TASK_IO_ACCOUNTING options need to be enabled in your
Linux kernel build configuration, these options depend on
CONFIG_TASKSTATS.</p>

<p>iotop displays columns for the I/O bandwidth read and
written by each process/thread during the sampling period.
It also displays the per- centage of time the thread/process
spent while swapping in and while waiting on I/O. For each
process, its I/O priority (class/level) is shown. In
addition, the total I/O bandwidth read and written during
the sampling period is displayed at the top of the
interface.</p>

<p>Use the left and right arrows to change the sorting, r
to reverse the sorting order, o to toggle the --only option,
p to toggle the --pro- cesses option, a to toggle the
--accumulated option, q to quit or i to change the priority
of a thread or a process thread(s). Any other key will force
a refresh.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --version Show the version number and exit</p>

<p>-h, --help Show usage information and exit</p>

<p>-o, --only Only show processes or threads actually doing
I/O, instead of showing all processes or threads. This can
be dynamically tog- gled by pressing o.</p>

<p>-b, --batch Turn on non-interactive mode. Useful for
logging I/O usage over time.</p>

<p>-n NUM, --iter=NUM Set the number of iterations before
quitting (never quit by default). This is most useful in
non-interactive mode.</p>

<p>-d SEC, --delay=SEC Set the delay between iterations in
seconds (1 second by default). Accepts non-integer values
such as 1.1 seconds.</p>

<p>-p PID, --pid=PID A list of processes/threads to monitor
(all by default).</p>

<p>-u USER, --user=USER A list of users to monitor (all by
default)</p>

<p>-P, --processes Only show processes. Normally iotop
shows all threads.</p>

<p>-a, --accumulated Show accumulated I/O instead of
bandwidth. In this mode, iotop shows the amount of I/O
processes have done since iotop started.</p>

<p>-k, --kilobytes Use kilobytes instead of a human
friendly unit. This mode is useful when scripting the batch
mode of iotop. Instead of choos- ing the most appropriate
unit iotop will display all sizes in kilobytes.</p>

<p>-t, --time Add a timestamp on each line (implies
--batch). Each line will be prefixed by the current
time.</p>

<p>-q, --quiet suppress some lines of header (implies
--batch). This option can be specified up to three times to
remove header lines. -q column names are only printed on the
first iteration, -qq column names are never printed, -qqq
the I/O summary is never printed.</p>
