<p>ENDPROTOENT(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
ENDPROTOENT(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME endprotoent, getprotobyname, getprotobynumber,
getprotoent, setprotoent - network protocol database
functions</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;netdb.h&gt;</p>

<p>void endprotoent(void); struct protoent
*getprotobyname(const char *name); struct protoent
*getprotobynumber(int proto); struct protoent
*getprotoent(void); void setprotoent(int stayopen);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION These functions shall retrieve information
about protocols. This infor- mation is considered to be
stored in a database that can be accessed sequentially or
randomly. The implementation of this database is
unspecified.</p>

<p>The setprotoent() function shall open a connection to
the database, and set the next entry to the first entry. If
the stayopen argument is non- zero, the connection to the
network protocol database shall not be closed after each
call to getprotoent() (either directly, or indirectly
through one of the other getproto*() functions), and the
implementation may maintain an open file descriptor for the
database.</p>

<p>The getprotobyname() function shall search the database
from the begin- ning and find the first entry for which the
protocol name specified by name matches the p_name member,
opening and closing a connection to the database as
necessary.</p>

<p>The getprotobynumber() function shall search the
database from the beginning and find the first entry for
which the protocol number speci- fied by proto matches the
p_proto member, opening and closing a connec- tion to the
database as necessary.</p>

<p>The getprotoent() function shall read the next entry of
the database, opening and closing a connection to the
database as necessary.</p>

<p>The getprotobyname(), getprotobynumber(), and
getprotoent() functions shall each return a pointer to a
protoent structure, the members of which shall contain the
fields of an entry in the network protocol database.</p>

<p>The endprotoent() function shall close the connection to
the database, releasing any open file descriptor.</p>

<p>These functions need not be reentrant. A function that
is not required to be reentrant is not required to be
thread-safe.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion,
getprotobyname(), getprotobynumber(), and getprotoent()
return a pointer to a protoent structure if the requested
entry was found, and a null pointer if the end of the
database was reached or the requested entry was not found.
Otherwise, a null pointer is returned.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The getprotobyname(),
getprotobynumber(), and getprotoent() functions may return
pointers to static data, which may be overwritten by subse-
quent calls to any of these functions.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
