<p>PTHREAD_EXIT(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
PTHREAD_EXIT(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME pthread_exit - thread termination</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;</p>

<p>void pthread_exit(void *value_ptr);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pthread_exit() function shall terminate
the calling thread and make the value value_ptr available to
any successful join with the terminat- ing thread. Any
cancellation cleanup handlers that have been pushed and not
yet popped shall be popped in the reverse order that they
were pushed and then executed. After all cancellation
cleanup handlers have been executed, if the thread has any
thread-specific data, appropriate destructor functions shall
be called in an unspecified order. Thread termination does
not release any application visible process resources,
including, but not limited to, mutexes and file descriptors,
nor does it perform any process-level cleanup actions,
including, but not lim- ited to, calling any atexit()
routines that may exist.</p>

<p>An implicit call to pthread_exit() is made when a thread
other than the thread in which main() was first invoked
returns from the start routine that was used to create it.
The functions return value shall serve as the threads exit
status.</p>

<p>The behavior of pthread_exit() is undefined if called
from a cancella- tion cleanup handler or destructor function
that was invoked as a result of either an implicit or
explicit call to pthread_exit().</p>

<p>After a thread has terminated, the result of access to
local (auto) variables of the thread is undefined. Thus,
references to local vari- ables of the exiting thread should
not be used for the pthread_exit() value_ptr parameter
value.</p>

<p>The process shall exit with an exit status of 0 after
the last thread has been terminated. The behavior shall be
as if the implementation called exit() with a zero argument
at thread termination time.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The pthread_exit() function cannot return
to its caller.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The normal mechanism by which a thread
terminates is to return from the routine that was specified
in the pthread_create() call that started it. The
pthread_exit() function provides the capability for a thread
to terminate without requiring a return from the start
routine of that thread, thereby providing a function
analogous to exit().</p>

<p>Regardless of the method of thread termination, any
cancellation cleanup handlers that have been pushed and not
yet popped are executed, and the destructors for any
existing thread-specific data are executed. This volume of
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 requires that cancellation cleanup
handlers be popped and called in order. After all
cancellation cleanup handlers have been executed,
thread-specific data destructors are called, in an
unspecified order, for each item of thread-specific data
that exists in the thread. This ordering is necessary
because cancella- tion cleanup handlers may rely on
thread-specific data.</p>

<p>As the meaning of the status is determined by the
application (except when the thread has been canceled, in
which case it is PTHREAD_CAN- CELED), the implementation has
no idea what an illegal status value is, which is why no
address error checking is done.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
