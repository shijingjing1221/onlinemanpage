<p>ACL_CALC_MASK(3) BSD Library Functions Manual
ACL_CALC_MASK(3)</p>

<p>NAME acl_calc_mask - calculate the file group class
mask</p>

<p>LIBRARY Linux Access Control Lists library (libacl,
-lacl).</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; #include
&lt;sys/acl.h&gt;</p>

<p>int acl_calc_mask(acl_t *acl_p);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The acl_calc_mask() function calculates and
sets the permissions associ- ated with the ACL_MASK ACL
entry of the ACL referred to by acl_p. The value of the new
permissions is the union of the permissions granted by all
entries of tag type ACL_GROUP, ACL_GROUP_OBJ, or ACL_USER.
If the ACL referred to by acl_p already contains an ACL_MASK
entry, its permis- sions are overwritten; if it does not
contain an ACL_MASK entry, one is added.</p>

<p>If the ACL referred to by acl_p does not contain enough
space for the new ACL entry, then additional working storage
may be allocated. If the work- ing storage cannot be
increased in the current location, then it may be relocated
and the previous working storage is released and a pointer
to the new working storage is returned via acl_p.</p>

<p>The order of existing entries in the ACL is undefined
after this func- tion.</p>

<p>Any existing ACL entry descriptors that refer to entries
in the ACL con- tinue to refer to those entries. Any
existing ACL pointers that refer to the ACL referred to by
acl_p continue to refer to the ACL.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The acl_calc_mask() function returns the
value 0 if successful; otherwise the value -1 is returned
and the global variable errno is set to indicate the
error.</p>

<p>ERRORS If any of the following conditions occur, the
acl_calc_mask() function returns -1 and sets errno to the
corresponding value:</p>

<p>[EINVAL] The argument acl is not a valid pointer to an
ACL.</p>

<p>[ENOMEM] The acl_calc_mask() function is unable to
allocate the memory required for an ACL_MASK ACL entry.</p>

<p>STANDARDS IEEE Std 1003.1e draft 17 (POSIX.1e,
abandoned)</p>
