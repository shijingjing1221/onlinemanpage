<p>READDIR(3) Linux Programmer s Manual READDIR(3)</p>

<p>NAME readdir, readdir_r - read a directory</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;dirent.h&gt;</p>

<p>struct dirent *readdir(DIR *dirp);</p>

<p>int readdir_r(DIR *dirp, struct dirent *entry, struct
dirent **result);</p>

<p>Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
feature_test_macros(7)):</p>

<p>readdir_r(): _POSIX_C_SOURCE &gt;= 1 || _XOPEN_SOURCE ||
_BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE || _POSIX_SOURCE</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The readdir() function returns a pointer to
a dirent structure repre- senting the next directory entry
in the directory stream pointed to by dirp. It returns NULL
on reaching the end of the directory stream or if an error
occurred.</p>

<p>On Linux, the dirent structure is defined as
follows:</p>

<p>struct dirent { ino_t d_ino; /* inode number */ off_t
d_off; /* offset to the next dirent */ unsigned short
d_reclen; /* length of this record */ unsigned char d_type;
/* type of file; not supported by all file system types */
char d_name[256]; /* filename */ };</p>

<p>The only fields in the dirent structure that are
mandated by POSIX.1 are: d_name[], of unspecified size, with
at most NAME_MAX characters preceding the terminating null
byte; and (as an XSI extension) d_ino. The other fields are
unstandardized, and not present on all systems; see NOTES
below for some further details.</p>

<p>The data returned by readdir() may be overwritten by
subsequent calls to readdir() for the same directory
stream.</p>

<p>The readdir_r() function is a reentrant version of
readdir(). It reads the next directory entry from the
directory stream dirp, and returns it in the
caller-allocated buffer pointed to by entry. (See NOTES for
information on allocating this buffer.) A pointer to the
returned item is placed in *result; if the end of the
directory stream was encoun- tered, then NULL is instead
returned in *result.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, readdir() returns a pointer to
a dirent structure. (This structure may be statically
allocated; do not attempt to free(3) it.) If the end of the
directory stream is reached, NULL is returned and errno is
not changed. If an error occurs, NULL is returned and errno
is set appropriately.</p>

<p>The readdir_r() function returns 0 on success. On error,
it returns a positive error number. If the end of the
directory stream is reached, readdir_r() returns 0, and
returns NULL in *result.</p>

<p>ERRORS EBADF Invalid directory stream descriptor
dirp.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO SVr4, 4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>NOTES Only the fields d_name and d_ino are specified in
POSIX.1-2001. The remaining fields are available on many,
but not all systems. Under glibc, programs can check for the
availability of the fields not defined in POSIX.1 by testing
whether the macros _DIRENT_HAVE_D_NAMLEN,
_DIRENT_HAVE_D_RECLEN, _DIRENT_HAVE_D_OFF, or
_DIRENT_HAVE_D_TYPE are defined.</p>

<p>Other than Linux, the d_type field is available mainly
only on BSD sys- tems. This field makes it possible to avoid
the expense of calling lstat(2) if further actions depend on
the type of the file. If the _BSD_SOURCE feature test macro
is defined, then glibc defines the fol- lowing macro
constants for the value returned in d_type:</p>

<p>DT_BLK This is a block device.</p>

<p>DT_CHR This is a character device.</p>

<p>DT_DIR This is a directory.</p>

<p>DT_FIFO This is a named pipe (FIFO).</p>

<p>DT_LNK This is a symbolic link.</p>

<p>DT_REG This is a regular file.</p>

<p>DT_SOCK This is a Unix domain socket.</p>

<p>DT_UNKNOWN The file type is unknown.</p>

<p>If the file type could not be determined, the value
DT_UNKNOWN is returned in d_type.</p>

<p>Currently, only some file systems (among them: Btrfs,
ext2, etx3, and ext4) have full support returning the file
type in d_type. All appli- cations must properly handle a
return of DT_UNKNOWN.</p>

<p>Since POSIX.1 does not specify the size of the d_name
field, and other non-standard fields may precede that field
within the dirent structure, portable applications that use
readdir_r() should allocate the buffer whose address is
passed in entry as follows:</p>

<p>len = offsetof(struct dirent, d_name) +
pathconf(dirpath, _PC_NAME_MAX) + 1 entryp =
malloc(len);</p>

<p>(POSIX.1 requires that d_name is the last field in a
struct dirent.)</p>
