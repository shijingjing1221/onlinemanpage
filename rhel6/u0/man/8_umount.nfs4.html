<p>UMOUNT.NFS(8) UMOUNT.NFS(8)</p>

<p>NAME umount.nfs, umount.nfs4 - unmount a Network File
System</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS umount.nfs dir [-fvnrlh ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION umount.nfs and umount.nfs4 are a part of
nfs(5) utilities package, which provides NFS client
functionality.</p>

<p>umount.nfs4 and umount.nfs are meant to be used by the
umount(8) com- mand for unmounting NFS shares. This
subcommand, however, can also be used as a standalone
command with limited functionality.</p>

<p>dir is the directory on which the file system is
mounted.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -f Force unmount the file system in case of
unreachable NFS system.</p>

<p>-v Be verbose.</p>

<p>-n Do not update /etc/mtab. By default, an entry is
created in /etc/mtab for every mounted file system. Use this
option to skip deleting an entry.</p>

<p>-r In case unmounting fails, try to mount read-only.</p>

<p>-l Lazy unmount. Detach the file system from the file
system hier- archy now, and cleanup all references to the
file system as soon as it is not busy anymore.</p>

<p>-h Print help message.</p>

<p>NOTE For further information please refer nfs(5) and
umount(8) manual pages.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/fstab file system table</p>

<p>/etc/mtab table of mounted file systems</p>
