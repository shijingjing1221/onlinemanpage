<p>NAME sg - execute command as different group ID</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sg [-] [group [-c ] command]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sg command works similar to newgrp but
accepts a command. The command will be executed with the
/bin/sh shell. With most shells you may run sg from, you
need to enclose multi-word commands in quotes. Another
difference between newgrp and sg is that some shells treat
newgrp specially, replacing themselves with a new instance
of a shell that newgrp creates. This doesn&acute;t happen
with sg, so upon exit from a sg command you are returned to
your previous group ID.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION The following configuration variables in
/etc/login.defs change the behavior of this tool:</p>

<p>SYSLOG_SG_ENAB (boolean) Enable &quot;syslog&quot;
logging of sg activity.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/passwd User account information.</p>

<p>/etc/shadow Secure user account information.</p>

<p>/etc/group Group account information.</p>

<p>/etc/gshadow Secure group account information.</p>
