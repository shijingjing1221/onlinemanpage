<p>NAME tickadj - set time-related kernel variables</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS tickadj [ tick ]</p>

<p>tickadj [ -Aqs ] [ -a tickadj ] [ -t tick ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The tickadj program reads, and optionally
modifies, several timekeep- ing-related variables in older
kernels that do not have support for precision ttimekeeping,
including HP-UX, SunOS, Ultrix, SGI and proba- bly others.
Those machines provide means to patch the kernel /dev/kmem.
Newer machines with precision time support, including
Solaris, Tru64, FreeBSD and Linux (with PPSkit patch) should
NOT use the program. The particular variables that can be
changed with tickadj include tick, which is the number of
microseconds added to the system time for a clock interrupt,
tickadj, which sets the slew rate and resolution used by the
adjtime system call, and dosynctodr, which indicates to the
ker- nels on some machines whether they should internally
adjust the system clock to keep it in line with time-of-day
clock or not.</p>

<p>On Linux, only the tick variable is supported and the
only allowed argument is the tick value.</p>

<p>By default, with no arguments, tickadj reads the
variables of interest in the kernel and displays them. At
the same time, it determines an &quot;optimal&quot; value
for the value of the tickadj variable if the intent is to
run the ntpd Network Time Protocol (NTP) daemon, and prints
this as well. Since the operation of tickadj when reading
the kernel mimics the operation of similar parts of the ntpd
program fairly closely, this can be useful when debugging
problems with ntpd.</p>

<p>Note that tickadj should be run with some caution when
being used for the first time on different types of
machines. The operations which tickadj tries to perform are
not guaranteed to work on all Unix machines and may in rare
cases cause the kernel to crash.</p>

<p>COMMAND LINE OPTIONS -a tickadj Set the kernel variable
tickadj to the value tickadjspecified.</p>

<p>-A Set the kernel variable tickadj to an internally
computed &quot;optimal&quot; value.</p>

<p>-t tick Set the kernel variable tick to the value tick
specified.</p>

<p>-s Set the kernel variable dosynctodr to zero, which
disables the hardware time-of-year clock, a prerequisite for
running the ntpd daemon under SunOS4.</p>

<p>-q Normally, tickadj is quite verbose about what it is
doing. The -q flag tells it to shut up about everything
except errors.</p>

<p>BUGS Fiddling with kernel variables at run time as a
part of ordinary opera- tions is a hideous practice which is
only necessary to make up for deficiencies in the
implementation of adjtime in many kernels and/or brokenness
of the system clock in some vendors kernels. It would be
much better if the kernels were fixed and the tickadj
program went away.</p>
