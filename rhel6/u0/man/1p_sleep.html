<p>SLEEP(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual SLEEP(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME sleep - suspend execution for an interval</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sleep time</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sleep utility shall suspend execution
for at least the integral number of seconds specified by the
time operand.</p>

<p>OPTIONS None.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p>time A non-negative decimal integer specifying the
number of seconds for which to suspend execution.</p>

<p>STDIN Not used.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of sleep:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in
arguments).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS If the sleep utility receives a
SIGALRM signal, one of the following actions shall be
taken:</p>

<p>1. Terminate normally with a zero exit status.</p>

<p>2. Effectively ignore the signal.</p>

<p>3. Provide the default behavior for signals described in
the ASYN- CHRONOUS EVENTS section of Utility Description
Defaults . This could include terminating with a non-zero
exit status.</p>

<p>The sleep utility shall take the standard action for all
other signals.</p>

<p>STDOUT Not used.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 The execution was successfully suspended for at least
time sec- onds, or a SIGALRM signal was received. See the
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS section.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES The sleep utility can be used to execute a
command after a certain amount of time, as in:</p>

<p>(sleep 105; command) &amp;</p>

<p>or to execute a command every so often, as in:</p>

<p>while true do command sleep 37 done</p>

<p>RATIONALE The exit status is allowed to be zero when
sleep is interrupted by the SIGALRM signal because most
implementations of this utility rely on the arrival of that
signal to notify them that the requested finishing time has
been successfully attained. Such implementations thus do not
dis- tinguish this situation from the successful completion
case. Other implementations are allowed to catch the signal
and go back to sleep until the requested time expires or to
provide the normal signal termi- nation procedures.</p>

<p>As with all other utilities that take integral operands
and do not specify subranges of allowed values, sleep is
required by this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 to deal with
time requests of up to 2147483647 seconds. This may mean
that some implementations have to make multiple calls to the
delay mechanism of the underlying operating system if its
argument range is less than this.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
