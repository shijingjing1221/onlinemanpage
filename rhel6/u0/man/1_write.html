<p>NAME write - send a message to another user</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS write user [ttyname]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Write allows you to communicate with other
users, by copying lines from your terminal to theirs.</p>

<p>When you run the write command, the user you are writing
to gets a mes- sage of the form:</p>

<p>Message from yourname@yourhost on yourtty at hh:mm
...</p>

<p>Any further lines you enter will be copied to the
specified users ter- minal. If the other user wants to
reply, they must run write as well.</p>

<p>When you are done, type an end-of-file or interrupt
character. The other user will see the message EOF
indicating that the conversation is over.</p>

<p>You can prevent people (other than the super-user) from
writing to you with the mesg(1) command. Some commands, for
example nroff(1) and pr(1), may disallow writing
automatically, so that your output isnt overwritten.</p>

<p>If the user you want to write to is logged in on more
than one termi- nal, you can specify which terminal to write
to by specifying the ter- minal name as the second operand
to the write command. Alternatively, you can let write
select one of the terminals - it will pick the one with the
shortest idle time. This is so that if the user is logged in
at work and also dialed up from home, the message will go to
the right place.</p>

<p>The traditional protocol for writing to someone is that
the string -o, either at the end of a line or on a line by
itself, means that its the other persons turn to talk. The
string oo means that the person believes the conversation to
be over.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO mesg(1), talk(1), who(1)</p>

<p>HISTORY A write command appeared in Version 6 AT&amp;T
UNIX.</p>

<p>AVAILABILITY The write command is part of the
util-linux-ng package and is available from
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux-ng/.</p>
