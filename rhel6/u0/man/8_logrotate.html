<p>LOGROTATE(8) System Administrator s Manual
LOGROTATE(8)</p>

<p>NAME logrotate - rotates, compresses, and mails system
logs</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS logrotate [-dv] [-f|--force] [-s|--state file]
config_file ..</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION logrotate is designed to ease administration
of systems that generate large numbers of log files. It
allows automatic rotation, compression, removal, and mailing
of log files. Each log file may be handled daily, weekly,
monthly, or when it grows too large.</p>

<p>Normally, logrotate is run as a daily cron job. It will
not modify a log multiple times in one day unless the
criterium for that log is based on the logs size and
logrotate is being run multiple times each day, or unless
the -f or -force option is used.</p>

<p>Any number of config files may be given on the command
line. Later con- fig files may override the options given in
earlier files, so the order in which the logrotate config
files are listed is important. Normally, a single config
file which includes any other config files which are needed
should be used. See below for more information on how to use
the include directive to accomplish this. If a directory is
given on the command line, every file in that directory is
used as a config file.</p>

<p>If no command line arguments are given, logrotate will
print version and copyright information, along with a short
usage summary. If any errors occur while rotating logs,
logrotate will exit with non-zero status.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -d Turns on debug mode and implies -v. In debug
mode, no changes will be made to the logs or to the
logrotate state file.</p>

<p>-f, --force Tells logrotate to force the rotation, even
if it doesnt think this is necessary. Sometimes this is
useful after adding new entries to a logrotate config file,
or if old log files have been removed by hand, as the new
files will be created, and log- ging will continue
correctly.</p>

<p>-m, --mail &lt;command&gt; Tells logrotate which command
to use when mailing logs. This command should accept two
arguments: 1) the subject of the mes- sage, and 2) the
recipient. The command must then read a message on standard
input and mail it to the recipient. The default mail command
is /bin/mail -s.</p>

<p>-s, --state &lt;statefile&gt; Tells logrotate to use an
alternate state file. This is useful if logrotate is being
run as a different user for various sets of log files. The
default state file is /var/lib/logrotate.sta- tus.</p>

<p>--usage Prints a short usage message.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose Turns on verbose mode.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION FILE logrotate reads everything about the
log files it should be handling from the series of
configuration files specified on the command line. Each
configuration file can set global options (local definitions
over- ride global ones, and later definitions override
earlier ones) and specify logfiles to rotate. A simple
configuration file looks like this:</p>

<p># sample logrotate configuration file compress</p>

<p>/var/log/messages { rotate 5 weekly postrotate
/usr/bin/killall -HUP syslogd endscript }</p>

<p>&quot;/var/log/httpd/access.log&quot;
/var/log/httpd/error.log { rotate 5 mail www@my.org size
100k sharedscripts postrotate /usr/bin/killall -HUP httpd
endscript }</p>

<p>/var/log/news/* { monthly rotate 2 olddir
/var/log/news/old missingok postrotate kill -HUP cat
/var/run/inn.pid endscript nocompress }</p>

<p>The first few lines set global options; in the example,
logs are com- pressed after they are rotated. Note that
comments may appear anywhere in the config file as long as
the first non-whitespace character on the line is a #.</p>

<p>The next section of the config files defined how to
handle the log file /var/log/messages. The log will go
through five weekly rotations before being removed. After
the log file has been rotated (but before the old version of
the log has been compressed), the command /sbin/killall -HUP
syslogd will be executed.</p>

<p>The next section defines the parameters for both
/var/log/httpd/access.log and /var/log/httpd/error.log. They
are rotated whenever it grows over 100k in size, and the old
logs files are mailed (uncompressed) to www@my.org after
going through 5 rotations, rather than being removed. The
sharedscripts means that the postrotate script will only be
run once (after the old logs have been compressed), not once
for each log which is rotated. Note that the double quotes
around the first filename at the beginning of this section
allows logrotate to rotate logs with spaces in the name.
Normal shell quoting rules apply, with , &quot;, and
characters supported.</p>

<p>The last section defines the parameters for all of the
files in /var/log/news. Each file is rotated on a monthly
basis. This is con- sidered a single rotation directive and
if errors occur for more than one file, the log files are
not compressed.</p>

<p>Please use wildcards with caution. If you specify *,
logrotate will rotate all files, including previously
rotated ones. A way around this is to use the olddir
directive or a more exact wildcard (such as *.log).</p>

<p>Here is more information on the directives which may be
included in a logrotate configuration file:</p>

<p>compress Old versions of log files are compressed with
gzip(1) by default. See also nocompress.</p>

<p>compresscmd Specifies which command to use to compress
log files. The default is gzip. See also compress.</p>

<p>uncompresscmd Specifies which command to use to
uncompress log files. The default is gunzip.</p>

<p>compressext Specifies which extension to use on
compressed logfiles, if com- pression is enabled. The
default follows that of the configured compression
command.</p>

<p>compressoptions Command line options may be passed to
the compression program, if one is in use. The default, for
gzip(1), is &quot;-9&quot; (maximum compression).</p>

<p>copy Make a copy of the log file, but dont change the
original at all. This option can be used, for instance, to
make a snapshot of the current log file, or when some other
utility needs to truncate or parse the file. When this
option is used, the cre- ate option will have no effect, as
the old log file stays in place.</p>

<p>copytruncate Truncate the original log file in place
after creating a copy, instead of moving the old log file
and optionally creating a new one. It can be used when some
program cannot be told to close its logfile and thus might
continue writing (appending) to the previous log file
forever. Note that there is a very small time slice between
copying the file and truncating it, so some log- ging data
might be lost. When this option is used, the create option
will have no effect, as the old log file stays in place.</p>

<p>create mode owner group Immediately after rotation
(before the postrotate script is run) the log file is
created (with the same name as the log file just rotated).
mode specifies the mode for the log file in octal (the same
as chmod(2)), owner specifies the user name who will own the
log file, and group specifies the group the log file will
belong to. Any of the log file attributes may be omitted, in
which case those attributes for the new file will use the
same values as the original log file for the omitted
attributes. This option can be disabled using the nocreate
option.</p>

<p>daily Log files are rotated every day.</p>

<p>dateext Archive old versions of log files adding a daily
extension like YYYYMMDD instead of simply adding a number.
The extension may be configured using the dateformat
option.</p>

<p>dateformat format_string Specify the extension for
dateext using the notation similar to strftime(3) function.
Only %Y %m %d and %s specifiers are allowed. The default
value is -%Y%m%d. Note that also the char- acter separating
log name from the extension is part of the dateformat
string. The system clock must be set past Sep 9th 2001 for
%s to work correctly. Note that the datestamps gener- ated
by this format must be lexically sortable (i.e., first the
year, then the month then the day. e.g., 2001/12/01 is ok,
but 01/12/2001 is not, since 01/11/2002 would sort lower
while it is later). This is because when using the rotate
option, logrotate sorts all rotated filenames to find out
which logfiles are older and should be removed.</p>

<p>delaycompress Postpone compression of the previous log
file to the next rota- tion cycle. This only has effect when
used in combination with compress. It can be used when some
program cannot be told to close its logfile and thus might
continue writing to the previ- ous log file for some
time.</p>

<p>extension ext Log files with ext extension can keep it
after the rotation. If compression is used, the compression
extension (normally .gz) appears after ext. For example you
have a logfile named mylog.foo and want to rotate it to
mylog.1.foo.gz instead of mylog.foo.1.gz.</p>

<p>ifempty Rotate the log file even if it is empty,
overriding the notifempty option (ifempty is the
default).</p>

<p>include file_or_directory Reads the file given as an
argument as if it was included inline where the include
directive appears. If a directory is given, most of the
files in that directory are read in alphabetic order before
processing of the including file continues. The only files
which are ignored are files which are not regular files
(such as directories and named pipes) and files whose names
end with one of the taboo extensions, as specified by the
tabooext directive. The include directive may not appear
inside a log file definition.</p>

<p>mail address When a log is rotated out-of-existence, it
is mailed to address. If no mail should be generated by a
particular log, the nomail directive may be used.</p>

<p>mailfirst When using the mail command, mail the
just-rotated file, instead of the about-to-expire file.</p>

<p>maillast When using the mail command, mail the
about-to-expire file, instead of the just-rotated file (this
is the default).</p>

<p>maxage count Remove rotated logs older than
&lt;count&gt; days. The age is only checked if the logfile
is to be rotated. The files are mailed to the configured
address if maillast and mail are configured.</p>

<p>minsize size Log files are rotated when they grow bigger
than size bytes, but not before the additionally specified
time interval (daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly). The
related size option is similar except that it is mutually
exclusive with the time interval options, and it causes log
files to be rotated without regard for the last rotation
time. When minsize is used, both the size and timestamp of a
log file are considered.</p>

<p>missingok If the log file is missing, go on to the next
one without issu- ing an error message. See also
nomissingok.</p>

<p>monthly Log files are rotated the first time logrotate
is run in a month (this is normally on the first day of the
month).</p>

<p>nocompress Old versions of log files are not compressed.
See also compress.</p>

<p>nocopy Do not copy the original log file and leave it in
place. (this overrides the copy option).</p>

<p>nocopytruncate Do not truncate the original log file in
place after creating a copy (this overrides the copytruncate
option).</p>

<p>nocreate New log files are not created (this overrides
the create option).</p>

<p>nodelaycompress Do not postpone compression of the
previous log file to the next rotation cycle (this overrides
the delaycompress option).</p>

<p>nodateext Do not archive old versions of log files with
date extension (this overrides the dateext option).</p>

<p>nomail Dont mail old log files to any address.</p>

<p>nomissingok If a log file does not exist, issue an
error. This is the default.</p>

<p>noolddir Logs are rotated in the same directory the log
normally resides in (this overrides the olddir option).</p>

<p>nosharedscripts Run prerotate and postrotate scripts for
every log file which is rotated (this is the default, and
overrides the sharedscripts option). The absolute path to
the log file is passed as first argument to the script. If
the scripts exit with error, the remaining actions will not
be executed for the affected log only.</p>

<p>noshred Do not use shred when deleting old log files.
See also shred.</p>

<p>notifempty Do not rotate the log if it is empty (this
overrides the ifempty option).</p>

<p>olddir directory Logs are moved into directory for
rotation. The directory must be on the same physical device
as the log file being rotated, and is assumed to be relative
to the directory holding the log file unless an absolute
path name is specified. When this option is used all old
versions of the log end up in directory. This option may be
overridden by the noolddir option.</p>

<p>postrotate/endscript The lines between postrotate and
endscript (both of which must appear on lines by themselves)
are executed (using /bin/sh) after the log file is rotated.
These directives may only appear inside a log file
definition. Normally, the absolute path to the log file is
passed as first argument to the script. If shared- scripts
is specified, whole pattern is passed to the script. See
also prerotate. See sharedscripts and nosharedscripts for
error handling.</p>

<p>prerotate/endscript The lines between prerotate and
endscript (both of which must appear on lines by themselves)
are executed (using /bin/sh) before the log file is rotated
and only if the log will actually be rotated. These
directives may only appear inside a log file definition.
Normally, the absolute path to the log file is passed as
first argument to the script. If sharedscripts is specified,
whole pattern is passed to the script. See also postrotate.
See sharedscripts and nosharedscripts for error
handling.</p>

<p>firstaction/endscript The lines between firstaction and
endscript (both of which must appear on lines by themselves)
are executed (using /bin/sh) once before all log files that
match the wildcarded pattern are rotated, before prerotate
script is run and only if at least one log will actually be
rotated. These directives may only appear inside a log file
definition. Whole pattern is passed to the script as first
argument. If the script exits with error, no further
processing is done. See also lastaction.</p>

<p>lastaction/endscript The lines between lastaction and
endscript (both of which must appear on lines by themselves)
are executed (using /bin/sh) once after all log files that
match the wildcarded pattern are rotated, after postrotate
script is run and only if at least one log is rotated. These
directives may only appear inside a log file definition.
Whole pattern is passed to the script as first argument. If
the script exits with error, just an error message is shown
(as this is the last action). See also firstaction.</p>

<p>rotate count Log files are rotated count times before
being removed or mailed to the address specified in a mail
directive. If count is 0, old versions are removed rather
than rotated.</p>

<p>size size Log files are rotated when they grow bigger
than size bytes. If size is followed by k, the size is
assumed to be in kilobytes. If the M is used, the size is in
megabytes, and if G is used, the size is in gigabytes. So
size 100, size 100k, size 100M and size 100Gare all
valid.</p>

<p>sharedscripts Normally, prerotate and postrotate scripts
are run for each log which is rotated and the absolute path
to the log file is passed as first argument to the script.
That means a single script may be run multiple times for log
file entries which match multiple files (such as the
/var/log/news/* example). If sharedscripts is specified, the
scripts are only run once, no matter how many logs match the
wildcarded pattern, and whole pattern is passed to them.
However, if none of the logs in the pattern require
rotating, the scripts will not be run at all. If the scripts
exit with error, the remaining actions will not be executed
for any logs. This option overrides the nosharedscripts
option and implies create option.</p>

<p>shred Delete log files using shred -u instead of
unlink(). This should ensure that logs are not readable
after their scheduled deletion; this is off by default. See
also noshred.</p>

<p>shredcycles count Asks GNU shred(1) to overwite log
files count times before dele- tion. Without this option,
shreds default will be used.</p>

<p>start count This is the number to use as the base for
rotation. For example, if you specify 0, the logs will be
created with a .0 extension as they are rotated from the
original log files. If you specify 9, log files will be
created with a .9, skipping 0-8. Files will still be rotated
the number of times specified with the count directive.</p>

<p>tabooext [+] list The current taboo extension list is
changed (see the include directive for information on the
taboo extensions). If a + pre- cedes the list of extensions,
the current taboo extension list is augmented, otherwise it
is replaced. At startup, the taboo extension list contains
.rpmorig, .rpmsave, ,v, .swp, .rpmnew, ~, .cfsaved and
.rhn-cfg-tmp-*.</p>

<p>weekly Log files are rotated if the current weekday is
less than the weekday of the last rotation or if more than a
week has passed since the last rotation. This is normally
the same as rotating logs on the first day of the week, but
it works better if logro- tate is not run every night.</p>

<p>yearly Log files are rotated if the current year is not
the same as the last rotation.</p>

<p>FILES /var/lib/logrotate.status Default state file.
/etc/logrotate.conf Configuration options.</p>
