<p>IBDIAGPATH(1) IB DIAGNOSTIC PACKAGE IBDIAGPATH(1)</p>

<p>NAME ibdiagpath - IB diagnostic path</p>

<p>SYNOPSYS ibdiagpath {-n &lt;[src-name,]dst-name&gt;|-l
&lt;[src-lid,]dst-lid&gt;|-d &lt;p1,p2,p3,...&gt;} [-c
&lt;count&gt;] [-v] [-t &lt;topo-file&gt;] [-s
&lt;sys-name&gt;] [-i &lt;dev-index&gt;] [-p
&lt;port-num&gt;] [-o &lt;out-dir&gt;] [-lw
&lt;1x|4x|12x&gt;] [-ls &lt;2.5|5|10&gt;] [-pm] [-pc] [-P
&lt;&lt;PM counter&gt;=&lt;Trash Limit&gt;&gt;]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION ibdiagpath traces a path between two
end-points and provides information regarding the nodes and
ports traversed along the path. It utilizes device specific
health queries for the different devices along the traversed
path. The way ibdiagpath operates depends on the addressing
mode used on the command line. If directed route adressing
is used, the local node is the source node and the route to
the destination port is known apriori. On the other hand, if
LID route (or by-name) addressing is imployed, then the
source and destination ports of a route are specified by
their LIDs (or by the names defined in the topology file).
In this case, the actual path from the local port to the
source port, and from the source port to the destination
port, is defined by means of Subnet Management Linear
Forwarding Table queries of the switch nodes along those
paths. Therefore, the path cannot be predicted as it may
change. The tool allows omitting the source node, in which
case the local port on the machine running the tool is
assumed to be the source. Note: When ibdiagpath queries for
the performance counters along the path between the source
and destination ports, it always traverses the LID route,
even if a directed route is specified. If along the LID
route one or more links are not in the ACTIVE state,
ibdiagpath reports an error. Checks for path validity from
partitions, IPoIB and QoS perspectives are also
provided.</p>

<p>ibdiagpath.log - A dump of all the application reports
generate according to the provided flags</p>

<p>ibdiagnet.pm - A dump of the pm Counters values, of the
fabric links</p>

<p>OPTIONS -n &lt;[src-name,]dst-name&gt; : Names of the
source and destination ports (as defined in the topology
file; source may be omitted -&gt; local port is assumed to
be the source) -l &lt;[src-lid,]dst-lid&gt; : Source and
destination LIDs (source may be omitted -&gt; local port is
assumed to be the source) -d &lt;p1,p2,p3,...&gt; : directed
route from the local node (which is the source) and the
destination node -c &lt;count&gt; : The minimal number of
packets to be sent across each link (default = 100) -v :
Enable verbose mode -t &lt;topo-file&gt; : Specifies the
topology file name -s &lt;sys-name&gt; : Specifies the local
system name. Meaningful only if a topology file is specified
-i &lt;dev-index&gt; : Specifies the index of the device of
the port used to connect to the IB fabric (in case of
multiple devices on the local system) -p &lt;port-num&gt; :
Specifies the local device s port number used to connect to
the IB fabric -o &lt;out-dir&gt; : Specifies the directory
where the output files will be placed (default = /tmp) -lw
&lt;1x|4x|12x&gt; : Specifies the expected link width -ls
&lt;2.5|5|10&gt; : Specifies the expected link speed -pm :
Dump all the fabric links, pm Counters into ibdiagnet.pm -pc
: Reset all the fabric links pmCounters -P
&lt;PM=&lt;Trash&gt;&gt; : If any of the provided pm is
greater then its provided value, print it to screen
-h|--help : Prints the help page information -V|--version :
Prints the version of the tool --vars : Prints the tool s
environment variables and their values</p>

<p>ERROR CODES 1 - The path traced is un-healthy 2 - Failed
to parse command line options 3 - More then 64 hops are
required for traversing the local port to the
&quot;Source&quot; port and then to the
&quot;Destination&quot; port. 4 - Unable to traverse the LFT
data from source to destination 5 - Failed to use Topology
File 6 - Failed to load required Package</p>
