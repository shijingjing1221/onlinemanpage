<p>ETHER-WAKE(8) ETHER-WAKE(8)</p>

<p>NAME ether-wake - A tool to send a Wake-On-LAN
&quot;Magic Packet&quot;</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ether-wake [options] Host-ID</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page documents the usage of the
ether-wake command.</p>

<p>ether-wake is a program that generates and transmits a
Wake-On-LAN (WOL) &quot;Magic Packet&quot;, used for
restarting machines that have been soft- powered-down (ACPI
D3-warm state). It generates the standard AMD Magic Packet
format, optionally with a password included. The single
required parameter is a station (MAC) address or a host ID
that can be translated to a MAC address by an ethers(5)
database specified in nss- witch.conf(5)</p>

<p>OPTIONS ether-wake needs a single dash (&acute;-&acute;)
in front of options. A summary of options is included
below.</p>

<p>-b Send the wake-up packet to the broadcast address.</p>

<p>-D Increase the Debug Level.</p>

<p>-i ifname Use interface ifname instead of the default
&quot;eth0&quot;.</p>

<p>-p passwd Append a four or six byte password to the
packet. Only a few adapters need or support this. A six byte
password may be speci- fied in Ethernet hex format
(00:22:44:66:88:aa) or four byte dotted decimal
(192.168.1.1) format. A four byte password must use the
dotted decimal format.</p>

<p>-V Show the program version information.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS This program returns 0 on success. A
permission failures (e.g. run as a non-root user) results in
an exit status of 2. Unrecognized or invalid parameters
result in an exit status of 3. Failure to retrieve network
interface information or send a packet will result in an
exit status of 1.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO arp(8).</p>

<p>SECURITY On some non-Linux systems dropping root
capability allows the process to be dumped, traced or
debugged. If someone traces this program, they get control
of a raw socket. Linux handles this safely, but beware when
porting this program.</p>

<p>AUTHOR The etherwake program was written by Donald
Becker at Scyld Computing Corporation for use with the
Scyld() Beowulf System.</p>
