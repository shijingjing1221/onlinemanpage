<p>SKILL(1) Linux User s Manual SKILL(1)</p>

<p>NAME skill, snice - send a signal or report process
status</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS skill [signal to send] [options] process
selection criteria snice [new priority] [options] process
selection criteria</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION These tools are probably obsolete and
unportable. The command syntax is poorly defined. Consider
using the killall, pkill, and pgrep commands instead.</p>

<p>The default signal for skill is TERM. Use -l or -L to
list available signals. Particularly useful signals include
HUP, INT, KILL, STOP, CONT, and 0. Alternate signals may be
specified in three ways: -9 -SIGKILL -KILL.</p>

<p>The default priority for snice is +4. (snice +4 ...)
Priority numbers range from +20 (slowest) to -20 (fastest).
Negative priority numbers are restricted to administrative
users.</p>

<p>GENERAL OPTIONS -f fast mode This is not currently
useful. -i interactive use You will be asked to approve each
action. -v verbose output Display information about selected
processes. -w warnings enabled This is not currently useful.
-n no action This only displays the process ID. -V show
version Displays version of program.</p>

<p>PROCESS SELECTION OPTIONS Selection criteria can be:
terminal, user, pid, command. The options below may be used
to ensure correct interpretation. Do not blame Albert for
this interesting interface.</p>

<p>-t The next argument is a terminal (tty or pty). -u The
next argument is a username. -p The next argument is a
process ID number. -c The next argument is a command
name.</p>

<p>SIGNALS The signals listed below may be available for
use with skill. When known, numbers and default behavior are
shown.</p>
