<p>NAME chmod, fchmod - change permissions of a file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;</p>

<p>int chmod(const char *path, mode_t mode); int fchmod(int
fd, mode_t mode);</p>

<p>Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
feature_test_macros(7)):</p>

<p>fchmod(): _BSD_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;= 500</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION These system calls change the permissions of
a file. They differ only in how the file is specified:</p>

<p>* chmod() changes the permissions of the file specified
whose pathname is given in path, which is dereferenced if it
is a symbolic link.</p>

<p>* fchmod() changes the permissions of the file referred
to by the open file descriptor fd.</p>

<p>The new file permissions are specified in mode, which is
a bit mask created by ORing together zero or more of the
following:</p>

<p>S_ISUID (04000) set-user-ID (set process effective user
ID on execve(2))</p>

<p>S_ISGID (02000) set-group-ID (set process effective
group ID on execve(2); mandatory locking, as described in
fcntl(2); take a new files group from parent direc- tory, as
described in chown(2) and mkdir(2))</p>

<p>S_ISVTX (01000) sticky bit (restricted deletion flag, as
described in unlink(2))</p>

<p>S_IRUSR (00400) read by owner</p>

<p>S_IWUSR (00200) write by owner</p>

<p>S_IXUSR (00100) execute/search by owner
(&quot;search&quot; applies for direc- tories, and means
that entries within the directory can be accessed)</p>

<p>S_IRGRP (00040) read by group</p>

<p>S_IWGRP (00020) write by group</p>

<p>S_IXGRP (00010) execute/search by group</p>

<p>S_IROTH (00004) read by others</p>

<p>S_IWOTH (00002) write by others</p>

<p>S_IXOTH (00001) execute/search by others</p>

<p>The effective UID of the calling process must match the
owner of the file, or the process must be privileged (Linux:
it must have the CAP_FOWNER capability).</p>

<p>If the calling process is not privileged (Linux: does
not have the CAP_FSETID capability), and the group of the
file does not match the effective group ID of the process or
one of its supplementary group IDs, the S_ISGID bit will be
turned off, but this will not cause an error to be
returned.</p>

<p>As a security measure, depending on the file system, the
set-user-ID and set-group-ID execution bits may be turned
off if a file is written. (On Linux this occurs if the
writing process does not have the CAP_FSETID capability.) On
some file systems, only the superuser can set the sticky
bit, which may have a special meaning. For the sticky bit,
and for set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits on directories,
see stat(2).</p>

<p>On NFS file systems, restricting the permissions will
immediately influence already open files, because the access
control is done on the server, but open files are maintained
by the client. Widening the per- missions may be delayed for
other clients if attribute caching is enabled on them.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, zero is returned. On error, -1
is returned, and errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS Depending on the file system, other errors can be
returned. The more general errors for chmod() are listed
below:</p>

<p>EACCES Search permission is denied on a component of the
path prefix. (See also path_resolution(7).)</p>

<p>EFAULT path points outside your accessible address
space.</p>

<p>EIO An I/O error occurred.</p>

<p>ELOOP Too many symbolic links were encountered in
resolving path.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG path is too long.</p>

<p>ENOENT The file does not exist.</p>

<p>ENOMEM Insufficient kernel memory was available.</p>

<p>ENOTDIR A component of the path prefix is not a
directory.</p>

<p>EPERM The effective UID does not match the owner of the
file, and the process is not privileged (Linux: it does not
have the CAP_FOWNER capability).</p>

<p>EROFS The named file resides on a read-only file
system.</p>

<p>The general errors for fchmod() are listed below:</p>

<p>EBADF The file descriptor fd is not valid.</p>

<p>EIO See above.</p>

<p>EPERM See above.</p>

<p>EROFS See above.</p>
