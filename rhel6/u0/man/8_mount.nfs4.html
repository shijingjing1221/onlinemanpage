options]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION mount.nfs is a part of nfs(5) utilities
package, which provides NFS client functionality.</p>

<p>mount.nfs is meant to be used by the mount(8) command
for mounting NFS shares. This subcommand, however, can also
be used as a standalone com- mand with limited
functionality.</p>

<p>mount.nfs4 is used for mounting NFSv4 file system, while
mount.nfs is used to mount NFS file systems versions 3 or 2.
remotetarget is a server share usually in the form of
servername:/path/to/share. dir is the directory on which the
file system is to be mounted.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -r Mount file system readonly.</p>

<p>-V Print version.</p>

<p>-w Mount file system read-write.</p>

<p>-f Fake mount. Dont actually call the mount system

<p>-n Do not update /etc/mtab. By default, an entry is

option to skip making an entry.</p>

<p>-s Tolerate sloppy mount options rather than fail.</p>
