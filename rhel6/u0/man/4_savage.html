<p>CONFIGURATION DETAILS Please refer to xorg.conf(5) for
general configuration details. This section only covers
configuration details specific to this driver.</p>

<p>The following driver Options are supported:</p>

<p>Option &quot;HWCursor&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;</p>

<p>Option &quot;SWCursor&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; These
two options interact to specify hardware or software cur-
sor. If the SWCursor option is specified, any HWCursor
setting is ignored. Thus, either &quot;HWCursor off&quot; or
&quot;SWCursor on&quot; will force the use of the software
cursor. On Savage/MX and Sav- age/IX chips which are
connected to LCDs, a software cursor will be forced, because
the Savage hardware cursor does not correctly track the
automatic panel expansion feature. Default: hardware
cursor.</p>

<p>Option &quot;NoAccel&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Disable
or enable acceleration. Default: acceleration is
enabled.</p>

<p>Option &quot;AccelMethod&quot; &quot;string&quot;
Chooses between available acceleration architectures. Valid
options are XAA and EXA. XAA is the traditional acceleration
architecture and support for it is very stable. EXA is a
newer acceleration architecture with better performance for
the Render and Composite extensions, but the rendering code
for it is newer and possibly unstable. The default is
XAA.</p>

<p>Option &quot;Rotate&quot; &quot;CW&quot;</p>

<p>Option &quot;Rotate&quot; &quot;CCW&quot; Rotate the
desktop 90 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise. This
option forces the ShadowFB option on, and disables acceler-
ation and the RandR extension. Default: no rotation.</p>

<p>Option &quot;ShadowFB&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Enable
or disable use of the shadow framebuffer layer. This option
disables acceleration. Default: off.</p>

<p>Option &quot;LCDClock&quot; &quot;frequency&quot;
Override the maximum dot clock. Some LCD panels produce
incor- rect results if they are driven at too fast of a
frequency. If UseBIOS is on, the BIOS will usually restrict
the clock to the correct range. If not, it might be
necessary to override it here. The frequency parameter may
be specified as an integer in Hz (135750000), or with
standard suffixes like &quot;k&quot;, &quot;kHz&quot;,
&quot;M&quot;, or &quot;MHz&quot; (as in 135.75MHz).</p>

<p>Option &quot;CrtOnly&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; This
option disables output to the LCD and enables output to the
CRT port only. It is useful on laptops if you only want to
use the CRT port or to force the CRT output only on desktop
cards that use mobile chips. Default: auto-detect active
outputs</p>

<p>Option &quot;UseBIOS&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Enable or
disable use of the video BIOS to change modes. Ordi- narily,
the savage driver tries to use the video BIOS to do mode
switches. This generally produces the best results with the
mobile chips (/MX and /IX), since the BIOS knows how to
handle the critical but unusual timing requirements of the
various LCD panels supported by the chip. To do this, the
driver searches through the BIOS mode list, looking for the
mode which most closely matches the xorg.conf mode line.
Some purists find this scheme objectionable. If you would
rather have the savage driver use your mode line timing
exactly, turn off the UseBios option. Note: Use of the BIOS
is required for dualhead opera- tion. Default: on (use the
BIOS).</p>

<p>Option &quot;IgnoreEDID&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Do not
use EDID data for mode validation, but DDC is still used for
monitor detection. This is different from NoDDC option. The
default value is off.</p>

<p>Option &quot;ShadowStatus&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
Enables the use of a shadow status register. There is a chip
bug in the Savage graphics engine that can cause a bus lock
when reading the engine status register under heavy load,
such as when scrolling text or dragging windows. The bug
affects about 4% of all Savage users without DRI and a large
fraction of users with DRI. If your system hangs regularly
while scrolling text or dragging windows, try turning this
option on. This uses an alternate method of reading the
engine status which is slightly more expensive, but avoids
the problem. When DRI is enabled then the default is
&quot;on&quot; (use shadow status), otherwise the default is
&quot;off&quot; (use normal status register).</p>

<p>Option &quot;DisableCOB&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
Disables the COB (Command Overflow Buffer) on savage4 and
newer chips. There is supposedly a HW cache coherency
problem on cer- tain savage4 and newer chips that renders
the COB useless. If you are having problems with 2D
acceleration you can disable the COB, however you will lose
some performance. 3D acceleration requires the COB to work.
This option only applies to Savage4 and newer chips.
Default: &quot;off&quot; (use COB).</p>

<p>Option &quot;BCIforXv&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Use the
BCI to copy and reformat Xv pixel data. Using the BCI for Xv
causes graphics artifacts on some chips. This option only
applies to Savage4 and prosavage/twister chips. On some
combinations of chipsets and video players, BCI formatting
might actually be slower than software formatting
(&quot;AGPforXv&quot; might help in this case). BCI
formatting can only be used on video data with a width that
is a multiple of 16 pixels (which is the vast majority of
videos). Other widths are handled through software
formatting. Default: on for prosavage and twister (use BCI
for Xv); off for savage4 (do not use the BCI for Xv).</p>

<p>Option &quot;AGPforXv&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
Instructs the BCI Xv pixel formatter to use AGP memory as a
scratch buffer. Ordinarily the BCI formatter uses a an area
in framebuffer memory to hold YV12 planar data to be
converted for display. This requires a somewhat expensive
upload of YV12 data to framebuffer memory. The
&quot;AGPforXv&quot; option causes the BCI for- matter to
place the YV12 data in AGP memory instead, which can be
uploaded faster than the framebuffer. Use of this option
cuts upload overhead by 25% according to benchmarks. This
option also smooths out most of the shearing present when
using BCI for pixel conversion. Currently this option is
experimental and is disabled by default. Video width
restrictions that apply to &quot;BCIforXv&quot; also apply
here. Only valid when &quot;DRI&quot; and
&quot;BCIforXv&quot; are both active, and only on AGP
chipsets. Default: &quot;off&quot;. If
&quot;AccelMethod&quot; is set to &quot;EXA&quot; and
&quot;AGPforXv&quot; is enabled, then the driver will also
attempt to reuse the AGP scratch buffer for UploadToScreen
acceleration.</p>

<p>Option &quot;AGPMode&quot; &quot;integer&quot; Set AGP
data transfer rate. (used only when DRI is enabled) 1 -- x1
(default) 2 -- x2 4 -- x4 others -- invalid</p>

<p>Option &quot;AGPSize&quot; &quot;integer&quot; The
amount of AGP memory that will allocated for DMA and tex-
tures in MB. Valid sizes are 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128 and 256.
The default is 16MB.</p>

<p>Option &quot;DmaMode&quot; &quot;string&quot; This
option influences in which way DMA (direct memory access) is
used by the kernel and 3D drivers. Any -- Try command DMA
first, then vertex DMA (default) Command -- Only use command
DMA or dont use DMA at all Vertex -- Only use vertex DMA or
dont use DMA at all None -- Disable DMA Command and vertex
DMA cannot be enabled at the same time. Which DMA mode is
actually used in the end also depends on the DRM version
(only &gt;= 2.4.0 supports command DMA) and the hardware
(Savage3D/MX/IX doesnt support command DMA).</p>

<p>Option &quot;DmaType&quot; &quot;string&quot; The type
of memory that will be used by the 3D driver for DMA (direct
memory access). PCI -- PCI memory (default on PCI cards) AGP
-- AGP memory (default on AGP cards) &quot;AGP&quot; only
works if you have an AGP card.</p>

<p>Option &quot;BusType&quot; &quot;string&quot; The bus
type that will be used to access the graphics card. PCI --
PCI bus (default on PCI cards) AGP -- AGP bus (default on
AGP cards) &quot;AGP&quot; only works if you have an AGP
card. If you choose &quot;PCI&quot; on an AGP card the AGP
bus speed is not set and no AGP aperture is allocated. This
implies DmaType &quot;PCI&quot;.</p>

<p>Option &quot;DRI&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Enable DRI
support. This option allows you to enable or disable the
DRI. Default: &quot;on&quot; (enable DRI).</p>
