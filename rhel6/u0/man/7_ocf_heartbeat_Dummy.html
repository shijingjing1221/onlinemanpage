<p>OCF_HEARTBEAT_DUMMY(7) OCF resource agents
OCF_HEARTBEAT_DUMMY(7)</p>

<p>NAME ocf_heartbeat_Dummy - Example stateless resource
agent</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS Dummy [start | stop | monitor | reload |
migrate_to | migrate_from | meta-data | validate-all]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This is a Dummy Resource Agent. It does
absolutely nothing except keep track of whether its running
or not. Its purpose in life is for testing and to serve as a
template for RA writers. NB: Please pay attention to the
timeouts specified in the actions section below. They should
be meaningful for the kind of resource the agent manages.
They should be the minimum advised timeouts, but they
shouldn&acute;t/cannot cover _all_ possible resource
instances. So, try to be neither overly generous nor too
stingy, but moderate. The minimum timeouts should never be
below 10 seconds.</p>

<p>SUPPORTED PARAMETERS state Location to store the
resource state in. (optional, string, default
/var/run/heartbeat/rsctmp/Dummy-{OCF_RESOURCE_INSTANCE}.state)</p>

<p>SUPPORTED ACTIONS This resource agent supports the
following actions (operations):</p>

<p>start Starts the resource. Suggested minimum timeout:
20.</p>

<p>stop Stops the resource. Suggested minimum timeout:
20.</p>

<p>monitor Performs a detailed status check. Suggested
minimum timeout: 20. Suggested interval: 10.</p>

<p>reload Suggested minimum timeout: 20.</p>

<p>migrate_to Executes steps necessary for migrating the
resource to the node. Suggested minimum timeout: 20.</p>

<p>migrate_from Executes steps necessary for migrating the
resource away from the node. Suggested minimum timeout:
20.</p>

<p>meta-data Retrieves resource agent metadata (internal
use only). Suggested minimum timeout: 5.</p>

<p>validate-all Performs a validation of the resource
configuration. Suggested minimum timeout: 20.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE The following is an example configuration for a
Dummy resource using the crm(8) shell:</p>

<p>primitive example_Dummy ocf:heartbeat:Dummy meta
allow-migrate=&quot;true&quot; op monitor
timeout=&quot;20&quot; interval=&quot;10&quot;
depth=&quot;0&quot;</p>
