<p>NAME fixfiles - fix file SELinux security contexts.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS fixfiles [-F] [-l logfile ] { check |
restore|[-f] relabel | verify } [[dir/file] ... ]</p>

<p>fixfiles [-F] [ -R rpmpackagename[,rpmpackagename...] ]
[-l logfile ] { check | restore | verify }</p>

<p>fixfiles [ -C PREVIOUS_FILECONTEXT ] [-l logfile ] {
check | restore | verify }</p>

<p>fixfiles onboot</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page describes the fixfiles
script.</p>

<p>This script is primarily used to correct the security
context database (extended attributes) on filesystems.</p>

<p>It can also be run at any time to relabel when adding
support for new policy, or just check whether the file
contexts are all as you expect. By default it will relabel
all mounted ext2, ext3, xfs and jfs file systems as long as
they do not have a security context mount option. You can
use the -R flag to use rpmpackages as an alternative.</p>

<p>fixfiles onboot will setup the machine to relabel on the
next reboot.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -l logfile Save the output to the specified
logfile</p>

<p>-F Force reset of context to match file_context for
customizable files</p>

<p>-f Clear /tmp directory with out prompt for removal.</p>

<p>-R rpmpackagename[,rpmpackagename...] Use the rpm
database to discover all files within the specified packages
and restore the file contexts. (-a will get all files in the
RPM database).</p>

<p>-C PREVIOUS_FILECONTEXT Run a diff on the
PREVIOUS_FILECONTEXT file to the currently installed one,
and restore the context of all affected files.</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS One of:</p>

<p>check print any incorrect file context labels, showing
old and new context, but do not change them.</p>

<p>restore change any incorrect file context labels.</p>

<p>relabel Prompt for removal of contents of /tmp directory
and then change any incorrect file context labels to match
the install file_con- texts file.</p>

<p>verify List out files with incorrect file context
labels, but do not change them.</p>

<p>[[dir/file] ... ] List of files or directories trees
that you wish to check file context on.</p>
