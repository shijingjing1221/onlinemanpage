<p>NAME sievec - Sieve script compiler for the Dovecot
secure IMAP server</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sievec [-d] [-x &quot;extension extension
...&quot;] script-file [out-file]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sievec command is part of the Pigeonhole
Sieve implementation for the Dovecot secure IMAP server.
Sieve (RFC 5228) is a simple and highly extensible language
for filtering e-mail messages. It can be imple- mented for
any type of mail access protocol, mail architecture and
operating system. The language cannot execute external
programs and in its basic form it does not provide the means
to cause infinite loops, making it suitable for running
securely on mail servers where mail users have no permission
run arbitrary programs.</p>

<p>Using the sievec command, Sieve scripts can be compiled
into a binary representation. The resulting binary can be
used directly to process e-mail messages during the delivery
process. The delivery of mail mes- sages and therefore also
the execution of Sieve scripts is performed by Dovecot s
local delivery agent (LDA) called deliver. Usually, it is
not necessary to compile the Sieve script manually using
sievec, because deliver will do this automatically if the
binary is missing. However, in some cases deliver does not
have permission to write the compiled binary to disk,
forcing it to recompile the script every time it is
executed. Using the sievec tool, this can be performed
manually by an authorized user to increase performance.</p>

<p>The sievec command accepts two arguments: the
script-file argument specifies the script to be compiled and
the out-file argument specifies where the (binary) output is
to be written. This Sieve implementation reconizes files
with a .sieve extension as Sieve scripts and corre- sponding
files with a .svbin extension as the associated compiled
binary. This means for example that Dovecots deliver process
will look for a binary file dovecot.svbin when it needs to
execute dove- cot.sieve. Such filename is chosen
automatically for the binary output when the out-file
argument is missing.</p>

<p>If the script-file argument is a directory, all files in
that direc- tory with a .sieve extension are compiled into a
corresponding .svbin binary file. The compilation is not
halted upon errors; it attempts to compile as many scripts
in the directory as possible. Note that the -d option and
the out-file argument are not allowed when the script-file
argument is a directory.</p>

<p>The sievec command is also useful to verify Sieve
scripts before using. Additionally, with the -d option it
can output a textual (and thus human-readable) dump of the
generated Sieve code to the specified file. The output is
then identical to what the sieved(1) command produces for a
stored binary file. This output is mainly useful to find
bugs in the compiler that yield corrupt binaries.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -d Don t write the binary to out-file, but write
a textual dump of the binary in stead. In this context, the
out-file value - has special meaning: it causes the the
textual dump to be written to stdout. The out-file argument
may also be omitted, which has the same effect as -. The
output is identical to what the sieved(1) command produces
for a compiled Sieve binary file. Note that this option is
not allowed when the out-file argument is a directory.</p>

<p>-x &quot;extension extension ...&quot; Set the available
extensions. The parameter is a space-separated list of the
active extensions. By prepending the extension iden- tifiers
with + or -, extensions can be included or excluded rel-
ative to the default set of extensions. If no extensions
have a + or - prefix, only those extensions that are
explicitly listed will be enabled. Unknown extensions are
ignored and a warning is produced. By default, all supported
extensions are available, except for deprecated extensions
or those that are still under development.</p>

<p>For example -x &quot;+imapflags -enotify&quot; will
enable the deprecated imapflags extension along with all
extensions that are available by default, except for the
enotify extension.</p>
