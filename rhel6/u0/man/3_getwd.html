<p>GETCWD(3) Linux Programmer s Manual GETCWD(3)</p>

<p>NAME getcwd, getwd, get_current_dir_name - Get current
working directory</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>char *getcwd(char *buf, size_t size);</p>

<p>char *getwd(char *buf);</p>

<p>char *get_current_dir_name(void);</p>

<p>Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
feature_test_macros(7)):</p>

<p>getcwd(): _BSD_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;= 500
get_current_dir_name(): _GNU_SOURCE</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION These functions return a null-terminated
string containing an absolute pathname that is the current
working directory of the calling process. The pathname is
returned as the function result and via the argument buf, if
present.</p>

<p>The getcwd() function copies an absolute pathname of the
current work- ing directory to the array pointed to by buf,
which is of length size.</p>

<p>If the length of the absolute pathname of the current
working direc- tory, including the terminating null byte,
exceeds size bytes, NULL is returned, and errno is set to
ERANGE; an application should check for this error, and
allocate a larger buffer if necessary.</p>

<p>As an extension to the POSIX.1-2001 standard, Linux
(libc4, libc5, glibc) getcwd() allocates the buffer
dynamically using malloc(3) if buf is NULL. In this case,
the allocated buffer has the length size unless size is
zero, when buf is allocated as big as necessary. The caller
should free(3) the returned buffer.</p>

<p>get_current_dir_name() will malloc(3) an array big
enough to hold the absolute pathname of the current working
directory. If the environment variable PWD is set, and its
value is correct, then that value will be returned. The
caller should free(3) the returned buffer.</p>

<p>getwd() does not malloc(3) any memory. The buf argument
should be a pointer to an array at least PATH_MAX bytes
long. If the length of the absolute pathname of the current
working directory, including the ter- minating null byte,
exceeds PATH_MAX bytes, NULL is returned, and errno is set
to ENAMETOOLONG. (Note that on some systems, PATH_MAX may
not be a compile-time constant; furthermore, its value may
depend on the file system, see pathconf(3).) For portability
and security reasons, use of getwd() is deprecated.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, these functions return a
pointer to a string containing the pathname of the current
working directory. In the case getcwd() and getwd() this is
the same value as buf.</p>

<p>On failure, these functions return NULL, and errno is
set to indicate the error. The contents of the array pointed
to by buf are undefined on error.</p>

<p>ERRORS EACCES Permission to read or search a component
of the filename was denied.</p>

<p>EFAULT buf points to a bad address.</p>

<p>EINVAL The size argument is zero and buf is not a null
pointer.</p>

<p>EINVAL getwd(): buf is NULL.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG getwd(): The size of the null-terminated
absolute pathname string exceeds PATH_MAX bytes.</p>

<p>ENOENT The current working directory has been
unlinked.</p>

<p>ERANGE The size argument is less than the length of the
absolute path- name of the working directory, including the
terminating null byte. You need to allocate a bigger array
and try again.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO getcwd() conforms to POSIX.1-2001. Note
however that POSIX.1-2001 leaves the behavior of getcwd()
unspecified if buf is NULL.</p>

<p>getwd() is present in POSIX.1-2001, but marked LEGACY.
POSIX.1-2008 removes the specification of getwd(). Use
getcwd() instead. POSIX.1-2001 does not define any errors
for getwd().</p>

<p>get_current_dir_name() is a GNU extension.</p>

<p>NOTES Under Linux, the function getcwd() is a system
call (since 2.1.92). On older systems it would query
/proc/self/cwd. If both system call and proc file system are
missing, a generic implementation is called. Only in that
case can these calls fail under Linux with EACCES.</p>

<p>These functions are often used to save the location of
the current working directory for the purpose of returning
to it later. Opening the current directory (&quot;.&quot;)
and calling fchdir(2) to return is usually a faster and more
reliable alternative when sufficiently many file descriptors
are available, especially on platforms other than Linux.</p>
