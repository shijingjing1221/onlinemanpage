<p>MAKEDEV(3) Linux Programmer s Manual MAKEDEV(3)</p>

<p>NAME makedev, major, minor - manage a device number</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #define _BSD_SOURCE #include
&lt;sys/types.h&gt;</p>

<p>dev_t makedev(int maj, int min);</p>

<p>int major(dev_t dev); int minor(dev_t dev);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION A device ID consists of two parts: a major
ID, identifying the class of the device, and a minor ID,
identifying a specific instance of a device in that class. A
device ID is represented using the type dev_t.</p>

<p>Given major and minor device IDs, makedev() combines
these to produce a device ID, returned as the function
result. This device ID can be given to mknod(2), for
example.</p>

<p>The major() and minor() functions perform the converse
task: given a device ID, they return, respectively, the
major and minor components. These macros can be useful to,
for example, decompose the device IDs in the structure
returned by stat(2).</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO The makedev() major() and minor()
functions are not specified in POSIX.1, but are present on
many other systems.</p>

<p>NOTES These interfaces are defined as macros. Since
glibc 2.3.3, they have been aliases for three GNU-specific
functions: gnu_dev_makedev(3), gnu_dev_major(3), and
gnu_dev_minor(3). The latter names are exported, but the
traditional names are more portable.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO mknod(2), stat(2)</p>
