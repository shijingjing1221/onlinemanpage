<p>NAME efix - convert between fax, text, bit-map and
gray-scale formats</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS efix [ options ] file...</p>

<p>OPTIONS Where options are:</p>

<p>-i f the input image is in format f. Default is to
automatically determine the input type from its
contents.</p>

<p>fax fax (&quot;Group3&quot;) 1-D coded image</p>

<p>text text. Line feeds separate lines, form feeds cause
page breaks and tabs are expanded assuming tabs every 8
columns.</p>

<p>pbm raw PBM (portable bit map)</p>

<p>tiffg3 TIFF format with Group 3 (fax) compression.</p>

<p>tiffraw TIFF format with no compression.</p>

<p>-o f write the output in format f. Default is
tiffg3.</p>

<p>fax fax (&quot;Group3&quot;) 1-D coded image</p>

<p>pbm raw PBM</p>

<p>pgm raw PGM (Portable Gray Map). Gray-scale values are
produced by summing pixels in 4x4 pixel blocks. The output
file is 1/4 of the size given by -p. The resulting image has
17 discrete values between 0 and 255.</p>

<p>pcl HP-PCL (e.g. HP LaserJet).</p>

<p>ps encapsulated Postscript (e.g. Apple Laserwriter). The
file is compressed using differential coding vertically and
run-length coding horizontally. There is no provision for
positioning the image within the page and so the image will
appear at the lower left corner of the page when
printed.</p>

<p>tiffg3 TIFF format with Group 3 (fax) compression.</p>

<p>tiffraw TIFF format with no compression.</p>

<p>-n pat use the printf(3) pattern path to generate the
output file name. Up to three %d escapes will be replaced by
the page number starting with 1 (e.g. -n order.%03d will
create file names order.001, order.002, etc.)</p>

<p>-v lvl print messages of type in string lvl. Each
lower-case letter in lvl enables one type of message:</p>

<p>e - errors w - warnings i - information messages a -
program arguments f - file format details</p>

<p>The default is &quot;ewi&quot;.</p>

<p>-f fnt use font file fnt for text. The font file for an
WxH font should be a bit map of an image of H rows and 256*W
columns. Each successive WxH cell contains the bit map for
characters with codes from 0 to 255. The default is to use a
built-in 8x16 font.</p>

<p>-s XxY scale the input by a factor of X horizontally and
Y verti- cally. Scaling does not change the size of the
output (use -p). If Y is not specified it is assumed to be
the same as X. Any floating point value may be used for X
and Y. The default is 1,1.</p>

<p>-d R,D displace the output right by R and down by D
(opposite if neg- ative). See below for units. Default is
0,0.</p>

<p>-p WxH truncate or pad the output to generate an image
of width W and height H. This does not scale the input. See
below for units. The default is the size of the input image
if it can be determined or A4 (215x297mm) if it cant.</p>

<p>-r XxY assume an output device resolution of X by Y dots
per inch. If Y is not specified it is assumed to be the same
as X. The default is the input resolution if it can be
determined or the fax resolution of 204.1x195.6 dpi if it
cant.</p>

<p>-R XxY assume an input device resolution of X by Y dots
per inch. If Y is not specified it is assumed to be the same
as X. The default is the input resolution if it can be
determined or the fax resolution of 204.1x195.6 dpi if it
cant.</p>

<p>-l n place n lines per page during text input. Default
is 66.</p>

<p>-O f overlay (logical OR) the image from file f into the
output. Use &quot;-&quot; for standard input (-O-). Default
is no overlay file.</p>

<p>-M ignore all other options and copy the standard input
to the standard output while applying base64 (MIME) encoding
as specified by RFC 1521.</p>

<p>FILES If no -n options are given, output is written to
the standard output.</p>

<p>UNITS The units of the W, H, R, and D values above are
in inches by default. Any floating point value may be used.
Units of inches, centimetres, millimetres or points (72 per
inch) can be used instead by appending one of the strings
in, cm, mm, or pt to the argument (e.g. -d2,4cm).</p>

<p>CUT AND PASTE The -d and -p options allow efix to cut
out images from received faxes for use in other faxes or
documents. The -d option specifies the top left portion of
the desired image and the -p option gives the size of the
cut image. For example, the command efix -d-5,-8 -p2,1
sample.001 &gt;sig.001 would cut out part of the input with
its top left corner 5 inches from the left edge and 8 inches
from top of the input image. The output image would be 2
inches wide and 1 inch high.</p>

<p>The -O option allows efix to superimpose two or more
images. The over- lay image must be in fax format and cannot
be scaled, truncated or shifted. However, multiple efix
commands may be used to transform images before combining
them. For example, the commands efix -d4,8 signature
&gt;sig.fax efix -O sig.fax letterhead &gt;letterhead.fax
efix -O letterhead.fax letter.002 &gt;letter.002.new will
shift the image in the file signature down 8 inches and
right 4 inches and combine (overlay) it with the images in
the files letterhead and letter.002.</p>
