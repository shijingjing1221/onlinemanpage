<p>CFGETISPEED(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
CFGETISPEED(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME cfgetispeed - get input baud rate</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;termios.h&gt;</p>

<p>speed_t cfgetispeed(const struct termios
*termios_p);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The cfgetispeed() function shall extract the
input baud rate from the termios structure to which the
termios_p argument points.</p>

<p>This function shall return exactly the value in the
termios data struc- ture, without interpretation.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, cfgetispeed()
shall return a value of type speed_t representing the input
baud rate.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The term &quot;baud&quot; is used historically
here, but is not technically cor- rect. This is properly
&quot;bits per second&quot;, which may not be the same as
baud. However, the term is used because of the historical
usage and understanding.</p>

<p>The cfgetospeed(), cfgetispeed(), cfsetospeed(), and
cfsetispeed() functions do not take arguments as numbers,
but rather as symbolic names. There are two reasons for
this:</p>

<p>1. Historically, numbers were not used because of the
way the rate was stored in the data structure. This is
retained even though a func- tion is now used.</p>

<p>2. More importantly, only a limited set of possible
rates is at all portable, and this constrains the
application to that set.</p>

<p>There is nothing to prevent an implementation accepting
as an extension a number (such as 126), and since the
encoding of the Bxxx symbols is not specified, this can be
done to avoid introducing ambiguity.</p>

<p>Setting the input baud rate to zero was a mechanism to
allow for split baud rates. Clarifications in this volume of
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 have made it possible to determine
whether split rates are supported and to support them
without having to treat zero as a special case. Since this
functionality is also confusing, it has been declared
obsolescent. The 0 argument referred to is the literal
constant 0, not the symbolic con- stant B0. This volume of
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 does not preclude B0 from being defined
as the value 0; in fact, implementations would likely
benefit from the two being equivalent. This volume of IEEE
Std 1003.1-2001 does not fully specify whether the previous
cfsetispeed() value is retained after a tcgetattr() as the
actual value or as zero. Therefore, conforming applications
should always set both the input speed and output speed when
setting either.</p>

<p>In historical implementations, the baud rate information
is tradition- ally kept in c_cflag. Applications should be
written to presume that this might be the case (and thus not
blindly copy c_cflag), but not to rely on it in case it is
in some other field of the structure. Setting the c_cflag
field absolutely after setting a baud rate is a non-
portable action because of this. In general, the unused
parts of the flag fields might be used by the implementation
and should not be blindly copied from the descriptions of
one terminal device to another.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
