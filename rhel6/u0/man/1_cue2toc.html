<p>CUE2TOC(1) CUE2TOC(1)</p>

<p>NAME cue2toc - convert CUE to TOC format</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS cue2toc [-hnqv] [-o tocfile] [-w wavefile]
[cuefile]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Cue2toc converts cuefile from CUE to TOC
format and writes the result to tocfile. If either cuefile
or tocfile is omitted or a single dash &quot;-&quot; cue2toc
reads from standard input and writes to standard ouput
respectively.</p>

<p>CUE files are text files describing the layout of a
CD-Rom and typi- cally carry the extension
&quot;.cue&quot;.</p>

<p>Cdrdao is a CD-burning application which has its own
native TOC format to describe the disc layout. Although
cdrdao has direct support for reading CUE files, it is
currently limited to data tracks only. So cue2toc s main
usefulness lies in converting CUE files containing audio
tracks.</p>

<p>Output of CD-Text data can be disabled with the -n
option.</p>

<p>CUE files often come with MP3 files but since cdrdao
doesnt support decoding them on the fly they probably must
be decoded by other means prior to writing the CD (e.g.
using lame). For this reason you can specify a filename with
the -w option to be used for all audio tracks instead of the
one in the CUE file. Of course this is only really use- ful
if all the tracks are based on the same file. This seems to
be the case quite often however.</p>

<p>Cue2toc normally displays warning messages for
unsupported commands and constructs. The -q option disables
these warnings.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -h print a short help message</p>

<p>-n no CD-Text; disable output of CD-Text information</p>

<p>-o tocfile write result to tocfile instead of standard
ouput</p>

<p>-q quiet mode; do not print warnings</p>

<p>-v print version number</p>

<p>-w wavefile use wavefile for all audio tracks</p>

<p>CUE FORMAT What follows is a description of the CUE
format expected by cue2toc. For information about the TOC
format please consult the cdrdao(1) manual page.</p>

<p>CUE files consist of commands and their arguments which
must be sepa- rated from each other by any number of
whitespace characters. Space, horizontal tabulator, newline
and carriage return are recognized as whitespace characters
except inside strings surrounded by double quotes, where
they are part of the string. Commands are not case sensi-
tive. CD-Text data can be at most 80 characters per
item.</p>

<p>Timecode values are accepted in the forms
&quot;X:X:X&quot;, &quot;X:X&quot; and &quot;X&quot; where
each &quot;X&quot; must consist of at most two digits and
may be zero padded to the left. They are interpreted as
&quot;M:S:F&quot;, &quot;S:F&quot; and &quot;F&quot;
respectively where &quot;M&quot; means &quot;minutes&quot;
and must be in the range 0 &lt;= M &lt;= 99, &quot;S&quot;
means &quot;seconds&quot; and must be in the range 0 &lt;= S
&lt;= 59, and &quot;F&quot; means &quot;frames&quot; and
must be in the range 0 &lt;= F &lt;= 74.</p>

<p>CUE files are logically divided into a global section
and one to 99 track sections. Inside these sections the
following commands are allowed:</p>

<p>Global Section REM anything_to_newline CATALOG string
CDTEXTFILE string TITLE string PERFORMER string SONGWRITER
string FILE string BINARY|MOTOROLA|AIFF|WAVE|MP3</p>

<p>REM Optional. Introduces a comment. Anything from there
on up to and including the next newline character is
ignored. Comments can appear anywhere in the file but not
between a command and its arguments.</p>

<p>CATALOG Optional. The Media Catalog Number of the disc.
Must be exactly 13 characters.</p>

<p>CDTEXTFILE Optional. Specifies an external file
containing CD-Text data. Ignored.</p>

<p>TITLE Optional. The CD-Text title of the disc.</p>

<p>PERFORMER Optional. The CD-Text performer of the
disc.</p>

<p>SONGWRITER Optional. The CD-Text songwriter of the
disc.</p>

<p>FILE Required. The name and type of the file to be used
for all fol- lowing tracks. The string contains the name of
the file fol- lowed by one of BINARY, MOTOROLA, AIFF, WAVE
or MP3. As far as cue2toc is concerned the type of the file
is effectively ignored. Nonetheless MOTOROLA, AIFF and MP3
cause printing of a warning message since these file types
can not be used directly with cdrdao.</p>

<p>The first appearance of a TRACK command causes leaving
of the global section and entering the track section.</p>

<p>Track Section TRACK number mode REM anything_to_newline
FLAGS [DCP] [4CH] [PRE] [SCMS] ISRC string TITLE string
PERFORMER string SONGWRITER string PREGAP timecode INDEX
number timecode POSTGAP timecode FILE string
BINARY|MOTOROLA|AIFF|WAVE|MP3</p>

<p>TRACK Required. Starts a new track definition. The
number is ignored. The mode must be one of AUDIO,
MODE1/2048, MODE1/2352, MODE2/2336 or MODE2/2352.</p>

<p>FLAGS Optional. Defines the flags for this track. Must
be followed by one or more of the following commands: DCP
(digital copy permit- ted), 4CH (four channel audio), PRE
(pre-emphasis enabled) and SCMS (serial copy management
system). SCMS is ignored because there is no corresponding
option in the TOC format.</p>

<p>ISRC Optional. The International Standard Recording Code
for this track. Must be exactly 12 characters long.</p>

<p>TITLE Optional. The CD-Text title of this track.</p>

<p>PERFORMER Optional. The CD-Text performer of this
track.</p>

<p>SONWRITER Optional. The CD-Text songwriter of this
track.</p>

<p>PREGAP Optional. The length of the track pregap to be
filled with zero data. Mutually exclusive with INDEX 0.</p>

<p>POSTGAP Optional. The length of the track postgap to be
filled with zero data.</p>

<p>INDEX Optional. The number must be in the range 0 &lt;=
number &lt;= 99. Index number 1 specifies the start of the
track. Index number 0 is the start of the track pregap
filled with data from the file, i.e. the difference between
index 0 and index 1 is the length of the pregap. Index 0 is
mutually exclusive with PREGAP. Index numbers greater than 1
specify subindexes for this track and must be
sequential.</p>

<p>FILE Optional in track section. The syntax is the same
as described above and if it appears inside a track
specification it takes effect on the next TRACK command.</p>

<p>LIMITATIONS The command CDTEXTFILE and the flag SCMS
have no equivalent in the TOC format and are ignored.</p>

<p>CUE files containing data tracks which specify a
starting time greater than zero cannot be converted by
cue2toc because the TOC format does not provide a way to
specify a starting time at all for data tracks. However if
the CUE file does not contain any audio tracks you can try
to use the CUE file directly with cdrdao.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE Suppose we have the following CUE file
&quot;uwe.froehn.cue&quot; describing an audio CD with
CD-Text data:</p>

<p>REM Example CUE file with audio tracks CATALOG
1234567890123 TITLE &quot;Der Berg ruft&quot; PERFORMER
&quot;Uwe Froehn&quot; FILE &quot;uwe.froehn.mp3&quot;
MP3</p>

<p>TRACK 01 AUDIO TITLE &quot;Meine Mama ist die
Beste&quot; PERFORMER &quot;Uwe Froehn&quot; SONGWRITER
&quot;Hansi Klabuster&quot; REM two seconds pregap filled
with audio data INDEX 00 00:00:00 INDEX 01 00:02:00 REM
subindexes INDEX 02 00:35:17 INDEX 03 01:12:44</p>

<p>TRACK 02 AUDIO TITLE &quot;Hoch oben im Tal&quot;
SONGWRITER &quot;Gabi Geil&quot; REM no pregap INDEX 01
02:45:38</p>

<p>TRACK 03 AUDIO REM pregap with zero data PREGAP 00:4:47
INDEX 01 07:58:74 REM postgap with zero data POSTGAP
00:35:00</p>

<p>Since cdrdao cannot decode the MP3 file on the fly this
step must be carried out by hand, e.g. using lame:</p>

<p>lame --decode uwe.froehn.mp3 uwe.froehn.wav</p>

<p>Although the filename appears only once in the example
CUE file it gets written for every track in the TOC file so
you would need to edit lots of occurences of the filename in
the TOC file by hand. For this reason you can specify a
string with the -w option to be used by cue2toc as the
filename for all audio tracks. The command</p>

<p>cue2toc -w uwe.froehn.wav -o uwe.froehn.toc
uwe.froehn.cue</p>

<p>should produce the file uwe.froehn.toc with the
following content:</p>

<p>CATALOG &quot;1234567890123&quot; CD_DA CD_TEXT {
LANGUAGE_MAP { 0 : EN } LANGUAGE 0 { TITLE &quot;Der Berg
ruft&quot; PERFORMER &quot;Uwe Froehn&quot; } }</p>

<p>TRACK AUDIO CD_TEXT { LANGUAGE 0 { TITLE &quot;Meine
Mama ist die Beste&quot; PERFORMER &quot;Uwe Froehn&quot;
SONGWRITER &quot;Hansi Klabuster&quot; } } AUDIOFILE
&quot;uwe.froehn.wav&quot; 00:00:00 02:45:38 START 00:02:00
INDEX 00:35:17 INDEX 01:12:44</p>

<p>TRACK AUDIO CD_TEXT { LANGUAGE 0 { TITLE &quot;Hoch oben
im Tal&quot; SONGWRITER &quot;Gabi Geil&quot; } } AUDIOFILE
&quot;uwe.froehn.wav&quot; 02:45:38 05:13:36</p>

<p>TRACK AUDIO PREGAP 00:04:47 AUDIOFILE
&quot;uwe.froehn.wav&quot; 07:58:74 SILENCE 00:35:00</p>

<p>BUGS Since cue2tocs definition of the CUE format is
entirely based on a number of different CUE files the author
came across there is a very high probability that it will
not work correctly with all the other CUE files you might
encounter. If this is the case for you please send the
problematic CUE file along with the version number of
cue2toc to &lt;der- matsch@gmx.de&gt;.</p>
