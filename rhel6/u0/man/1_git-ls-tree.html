<p>GIT-LS-TREE(1) Git Manual GIT-LS-TREE(1)</p>

<p>NAME git-ls-tree - List the contents of a tree
object</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS git ls-tree [-d] [-r] [-t] [-l] [-z]
[--name-only] [--name-status] [--full-name] [--full-tree]
[--abbrev=[&lt;n&gt;]] &lt;tree-ish&gt; [paths...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Lists the contents of a given tree object,
like what &quot;/bin/ls -a&quot; does in the current working
directory. Note that:</p>

<p>&middot; the behaviour is slightly different from that
of &quot;/bin/ls&quot; in that the paths denote just a list
of patterns to match, e.g. so specifying directory name
(without -r) will behave differently, and order of the
arguments does not matter.</p>

<p>&middot; the behaviour is similar to that of
&quot;/bin/ls&quot; in that the paths is taken as relative
to the current working directory. E.g. when you are in a
directory sub that has a directory dir, you can run git
ls-tree -r HEAD dir to list the contents of the tree (that
is sub/dir in HEAD). You dont want to give a tree that is
not at the root level (e.g. git ls-tree -r HEAD:sub dir) in
this case, as that would result in asking for sub/sub/dir in
the HEAD commit. However, the current working directory can
be ignored by passing --full-tree option.</p>

<p>OPTIONS &lt;tree-ish&gt; Id of a tree-ish.</p>

<p>-d Show only the named tree entry itself, not its
children.</p>

<p>-r Recurse into sub-trees.</p>

<p>-t Show tree entries even when going to recurse them.
Has no effect if -r was not passed. -d implies -t.</p>

<p>-l, --long Show object size of blob (file) entries.</p>

<p>-z line termination on output.</p>

<p>--name-only, --name-status List only filenames (instead
of the &quot;long&quot; output), one per line.</p>

<p>--abbrev[=&lt;n&gt;] Instead of showing the full 40-byte
hexadecimal object lines, show only a partial prefix. Non
default number of digits can be specified with
--abbrev=&lt;n&gt;.</p>

<p>--full-name Instead of showing the path names relative
to the current working directory, show the full path
names.</p>

<p>--full-tree Do not limit the listing to the current
working directory. Implies --full-name.</p>

<p>paths When paths are given, show them (note that this
isn t really raw pathnames, but rather a list of patterns to
match). Otherwise implicitly uses the root level of the tree
as the sole path argument.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FORMAT &lt;mode&gt; SP &lt;type&gt; SP
&lt;object&gt; TAB &lt;file&gt;</p>

<p>Unless the -z option is used, TAB, LF, and backslash
characters in pathnames are represented as , 0 and \,
respectively. This output format is compatible with what
--index-info --stdin of git update-index expects.</p>

<p>When the -l option is used, format changes to</p>

<p>&lt;mode&gt; SP &lt;type&gt; SP &lt;object&gt; SP
&lt;object size&gt; TAB &lt;file&gt;</p>

<p>Object size identified by &lt;object&gt; is given in
bytes, and right-justified with minimum width of 7
characters. Object size is given only for blobs (file)
entries; for other entries - character is used in place of
size.</p>
