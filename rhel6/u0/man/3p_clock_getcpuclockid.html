<p>CLOCK_GETCPUCLOCKID(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
CLOCK_GETCPUCLOCKID(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME clock_getcpuclockid - access a process CPU-time
clock (ADVANCED REAL- TIME)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;time.h&gt;</p>

<p>int clock_getcpuclockid(pid_t pid, clockid_t
*clock_id);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The clock_getcpuclockid() function shall
return the clock ID of the CPU-time clock of the process
specified by pid. If the process described by pid exists and
the calling process has permission, the clock ID of this
clock shall be returned in clock_id.</p>

<p>If pid is zero, the clock_getcpuclockid() function shall
return the clock ID of the CPU-time clock of the process
making the call, in clock_id.</p>

<p>The conditions under which one process has permission to
obtain the CPU-time clock ID of other processes are
implementation-defined.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion,
clock_getcpuclockid() shall return zero; otherwise, an error
number shall be returned to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The clock_getcpuclockid() function shall fail
if:</p>

<p>EPERM The requesting process does not have permission to
access the CPU-time clock for the process.</p>

<p>The clock_getcpuclockid() function may fail if:</p>

<p>ESRCH No process can be found corresponding to the
process specified by pid.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The clock_getcpuclockid() function is
part of the Process CPU-Time Clocks option and need not be
provided on all implementations.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
