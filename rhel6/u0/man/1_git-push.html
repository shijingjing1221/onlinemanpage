<p>GIT-PUSH(1) Git Manual GIT-PUSH(1)</p>

<p>NAME git-push - Update remote refs along with associated
objects</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS git push [--all | --mirror | --tags] [-n |
--dry-run] [--receive-pack=&lt;git-receive-pack&gt;]
[--repo=&lt;repository&gt;] [-f | --force] [-v | --verbose]
[-u | --set-upstream] [&lt;repository&gt;
[&lt;refspec&gt;...]]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Updates remote refs using local refs, while
sending objects necessary to complete the given refs.</p>

<p>You can make interesting things happen to a repository
every time you push into it, by setting up hooks there. See
documentation for git- receive-pack(1).</p>

<p>OPTIONS &lt;repository&gt; The &quot;remote&quot;
repository that is destination of a push operation. This
parameter can be either a URL (see the section GIT URLS
below) or the name of a remote (see the section REMOTES
below).</p>

<p>&lt;refspec&gt;... The format of a &lt;refspec&gt;
parameter is an optional plus +, followed by the source ref
&lt;src&gt;, followed by a colon :, followed by the
destination ref &lt;dst&gt;. It is used to specify with what
&lt;src&gt; object the &lt;dst&gt; ref in the remote
repository is to be updated.</p>

<p>The &lt;src&gt; is often the name of the branch you
would want to push, but it can be any arbitrary &quot;SHA-1
expression&quot;, such as master~4 or HEAD (see
git-rev-parse(1)).</p>

<p>The &lt;dst&gt; tells which ref on the remote side is
updated with this push. Arbitrary expressions cannot be used
here, an actual ref must be named. If :&lt;dst&gt; is
omitted, the same ref as &lt;src&gt; will be updated.</p>

<p>The object referenced by &lt;src&gt; is used to update
the &lt;dst&gt; reference on the remote side, but by default
this is only allowed if the update can fast-forward
&lt;dst&gt;. By having the optional leading +, you can tell
git to update the &lt;dst&gt; ref even when the update is
not a fast-forward. This does not attempt to merge
&lt;src&gt; into &lt;dst&gt;. See EXAMPLES below for
details.</p>

<p>tag &lt;tag&gt; means the same as
refs/tags/&lt;tag&gt;:refs/tags/&lt;tag&gt;.</p>

<p>Pushing an empty &lt;src&gt; allows you to delete the
&lt;dst&gt; ref from the remote repository.</p>

<p>The special refspec : (or +: to allow non-fast-forward
updates) directs git to push &quot;matching&quot; branches:
for every branch that exists on the local side, the remote
side is updated if a branch of the same name already exists
on the remote side. This is the default operation mode if no
explicit refspec is found (that is neither on the command
line nor in any Push line of the corresponding remotes
file---see below).</p>

<p>--all Instead of naming each ref to push, specifies that
all refs under refs/heads/ be pushed.</p>

<p>--mirror Instead of naming each ref to push, specifies
that all refs under refs/ (which includes but is not limited
to refs/heads/, refs/remotes/, and refs/tags/) be mirrored
to the remote repository. Newly created local refs will be
pushed to the remote end, locally updated refs will be force
updated on the remote end, and deleted refs will be removed
from the remote end. This is the default if the
configuration option remote.&lt;remote&gt;.mirror is
set.</p>

<p>-n, --dry-run Do everything except actually send the
updates.</p>

<p>--porcelain Produce machine-readable output. The output
status line for each ref will be tab-separated and sent to
stdout instead of stderr. The full symbolic names of the
refs will be given.</p>

<p>--delete All listed refs are deleted from the remote
repository. This is the same as prefixing all refs with a
colon.</p>

<p>--tags All refs under refs/tags are pushed, in addition
to refspecs explicitly listed on the command line.</p>

<p>--receive-pack=&lt;git-receive-pack&gt;,
--exec=&lt;git-receive-pack&gt; Path to the git-receive-pack
program on the remote end. Sometimes useful when pushing to
a remote repository over ssh, and you do not have the
program in a directory on the default $PATH.</p>

<p>-f, --force Usually, the command refuses to update a
remote ref that is not an ancestor of the local ref used to
overwrite it. This flag disables the check. This can cause
the remote repository to lose commits; use it with care.</p>

<p>--repo=&lt;repository&gt; This option is only relevant
if no &lt;repository&gt; argument is passed in the
invocation. In this case, git push derives the remote name
from the current branch: If it tracks a remote branch, then
that remote repository is pushed to. Otherwise, the name
&quot;origin&quot; is used. For this latter case, this
option can be used to override the name &quot;origin&quot;.
In other words, the difference between these two
commands</p>

<p>git push public #1 git push --repo=public #2</p>

<p>is that #1 always pushes to &quot;public&quot; whereas
#2 pushes to &quot;public&quot; only if the current branch
does not track a remote branch. This is useful if you write
an alias or script around git push.</p>

<p>-u, --set-upstream For every branch that is up to date
or successfully pushed, add upstream (tracking) reference,
used by argument-less git-pull(1) and other commands. For
more information, see branch.&lt;name&gt;.merge in
git-config(1).</p>

<p>--thin, --no-thin These options are passed to
git-send-pack(1). A thin transfer significantly reduces the
amount of sent data when the sender and receiver share many
of the same objects in common. The default is --thin.</p>

<p>-q, --quiet Suppress all output, including the listing
of updated refs, unless an error occurs. Progress is not
reported to the standard error stream.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose Run verbosely.</p>

<p>--progress Progress status is reported on the standard
error stream by default when it is attached to a terminal,
unless -q is specified. This flag forces progress status
even if the standard error stream is not directed to a
terminal.</p>

<p>GIT URLS In general, URLs contain information about the
transport protocol, the address of the remote server, and
the path to the repository. Depending on the transport
protocol, some of this information may be absent.</p>

<p>Git natively supports ssh, git, http, https, ftp, ftps,
and rsync protocols. The following syntaxes may be used with
them:</p>

<p>&middot;
ssh://[user@]host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/</p>

<p>&middot; git://host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/</p>

<p>&middot; http[s]://host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/</p>

<p>&middot; ftp[s]://host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/</p>

<p>&middot; rsync://host.xz/path/to/repo.git/</p>

<p>An alternative scp-like syntax may also be used with the
ssh protocol:</p>

<p>&middot; [user@]host.xz:path/to/repo.git/</p>

<p>The ssh and git protocols additionally support ~username
expansion:</p>

<p>&middot;
ssh://[user@]host.xz[:port]/~[user]/path/to/repo.git/</p>

<p>&middot;
git://host.xz[:port]/~[user]/path/to/repo.git/</p>

<p>&middot; [user@]host.xz:/~[user]/path/to/repo.git/</p>

<p>For local respositories, also supported by git natively,
the following syntaxes may be used:</p>

<p>&middot; /path/to/repo.git/</p>

<p>&middot; file:///path/to/repo.git/</p>

<p>These two syntaxes are mostly equivalent, except when
cloning, when the former implies --local option. See
git-clone(1) for details.</p>

<p>When git doesn t know how to handle a certain transport
protocol, it attempts to use the remote-&lt;transport&gt;
remote helper, if one exists. To explicitly request a remote
helper, the following syntax may be used:</p>

<p>&middot; &lt;transport&gt;::&lt;address&gt;</p>

<p>where &lt;address&gt; may be a path, a server and path,
or an arbitrary URL-like string recognized by the specific
remote helper being invoked. See git-remote-helpers(1) for
details.</p>

<p>If there are a large number of similarly-named remote
repositories and you want to use a different format for them
(such that the URLs you use will be rewritten into URLs that
work), you can create a configuration section of the
form:</p>

<p>[url &quot;&lt;actual url base&gt;&quot;] insteadOf =
&lt;other url base&gt;</p>

<p>For example, with this:</p>

<p>[url &quot;git://git.host.xz/&quot;] insteadOf =
host.xz:/path/to/ insteadOf = work:</p>

<p>a URL like &quot;work:repo.git&quot; or like
&quot;host.xz:/path/to/repo.git&quot; will be rewritten in
any context that takes a URL to be
&quot;git://git.host.xz/repo.git&quot;.</p>

<p>If you want to rewrite URLs for push only, you can
create a configuration section of the form:</p>

<p>[url &quot;&lt;actual url base&gt;&quot;] pushInsteadOf
= &lt;other url base&gt;</p>

<p>For example, with this:</p>

<p>[url &quot;ssh://example.org/&quot;] pushInsteadOf =
git://example.org/</p>

<p>a URL like
&quot;git://example.org/path/to/repo.git&quot; will be
rewritten to &quot;ssh://example.org/path/to/repo.git&quot;
for pushes, but pulls will still use the original URL.</p>

<p>REMOTES The name of one of the following can be used
instead of a URL as &lt;repository&gt; argument:</p>

<p>&middot; a remote in the git configuration file:
$GIT_DIR/config,</p>

<p>&middot; a file in the $GIT_DIR/remotes directory,
or</p>

<p>&middot; a file in the $GIT_DIR/branches directory.</p>

<p>All of these also allow you to omit the refspec from the
command line because they each contain a refspec which git
will use by default.</p>

<p>Named remote in configuration file You can choose to
provide the name of a remote which you had previously
configured using git-remote(1), git-config(1) or even by a
manual edit to the $GIT_DIR/config file. The URL of this
remote will be used to access the repository. The refspec of
this remote will be used by default when you do not provide
a refspec on the command line. The entry in the config file
would appear like this:</p>

<p>[remote &quot;&lt;name&gt;&quot;] url = &lt;url&gt;
pushurl = &lt;pushurl&gt; push = &lt;refspec&gt; fetch =
&lt;refspec&gt;</p>

<p>The &lt;pushurl&gt; is used for pushes only. It is
optional and defaults to &lt;url&gt;.</p>

<p>Named file in $GIT_DIR/remotes You can choose to provide
the name of a file in $GIT_DIR/remotes. The URL in this file
will be used to access the repository. The refspec in this
file will be used as default when you do not provide a
refspec on the command line. This file should have the
following format:</p>

<p>URL: one of the above URL format Push: &lt;refspec&gt;
Pull: &lt;refspec&gt;</p>

<p>Push: lines are used by git push and Pull: lines are
used by git pull and git fetch. Multiple Push: and Pull:
lines may be specified for additional branch mappings.</p>

<p>Named file in $GIT_DIR/branches You can choose to
provide the name of a file in $GIT_DIR/branches. The URL in
this file will be used to access the repository. This file
should have the following format:</p>

<p>&lt;url&gt;#&lt;head&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;url&gt; is required; #&lt;head&gt; is optional.</p>

<p>Depending on the operation, git will use one of the
following refspecs, if you dont provide one on the command
line. &lt;branch&gt; is the name of this file in
$GIT_DIR/branches and &lt;head&gt; defaults to master.</p>

<p>git fetch uses:</p>

<p>refs/heads/&lt;head&gt;:refs/heads/&lt;branch&gt;</p>

<p>git push uses:</p>

<p>HEAD:refs/heads/&lt;head&gt;</p>

<p>OUTPUT The output of &quot;git push&quot; depends on the
transport method used; this section describes the output
when pushing over the git protocol (either locally or via
ssh).</p>

<p>The status of the push is output in tabular form, with
each line representing the status of a single ref. Each line
is of the form:</p>

<p>&lt;flag&gt; &lt;summary&gt; &lt;from&gt; -&gt;
&lt;to&gt; (&lt;reason&gt;)</p>

<p>If --porcelain is used, then each line of the output is
of the form:</p>

<p>&lt;flag&gt; &lt;from&gt;:&lt;to&gt; &lt;summary&gt;
(&lt;reason&gt;)</p>

<p>The status of up-to-date refs is shown only if
--porcelain or --verbose option is used.</p>

<p>flag A single character indicating the status of the
ref:</p>

<p>(space) for a successfully pushed fast-forward;</p>

<p>+ for a successful forced update;</p>

<p>- for a successfully deleted ref;</p>

<p>* for a successfully pushed new ref;</p>

<p>! for a ref that was rejected or failed to push; and</p>

<p>= for a ref that was up to date and did not need
pushing.</p>

<p>summary For a successfully pushed ref, the summary shows
the old and new values of the ref in a form suitable for
using as an argument to git log (this is
&lt;old&gt;..&lt;new&gt; in most cases, and
&lt;old&gt;...&lt;new&gt; for forced non-fast-forward
updates). For a failed update, more details are given for
the failure. The string rejected indicates that git did not
try to send the ref at all (typically because it is not a
fast-forward). The string remote rejected indicates that the
remote end refused the update; this rejection is typically
caused by a hook on the remote side. The string remote
failure indicates that the remote end did not report the
successful update of the ref (perhaps because of a temporary
error on the remote side, a break in the network connection,
or other transient error).</p>

<p>from The name of the local ref being pushed, minus its
refs/&lt;type&gt;/ prefix. In the case of deletion, the name
of the local ref is omitted.</p>

<p>to The name of the remote ref being updated, minus its
refs/&lt;type&gt;/ prefix.</p>

<p>reason A human-readable explanation. In the case of
successfully pushed refs, no explanation is needed. For a
failed ref, the reason for failure is described.</p>

<p>NOTE ABOUT FAST-FORWARDS When an update changes a branch
(or more in general, a ref) that used to point at commit A
to point at another commit B, it is called a fast-forward
update if and only if B is a descendant of A.</p>

<p>In a fast-forward update from A to B, the set of commits
that the original commit A built on top of is a subset of
the commits the new commit B builds on top of. Hence, it
does not lose any history.</p>

<p>In contrast, a non-fast-forward update will lose
history. For example, suppose you and somebody else started
at the same commit X, and you built a history leading to
commit B while the other person built a history leading to
commit A. The history looks like this:</p>

<p>B / ---X---A</p>

<p>Further suppose that the other person already pushed
changes leading to A back to the original repository you two
obtained the original commit X.</p>

<p>The push done by the other person updated the branch
that used to point at commit X to point at commit A. It is a
fast-forward.</p>

<p>But if you try to push, you will attempt to update the
branch (that now points at A) with commit B. This does not
fast-forward. If you did so, the changes introduced by
commit A will be lost, because everybody will now start
building on top of B.</p>

<p>The command by default does not allow an update that is
not a fast-forward to prevent such loss of history.</p>

<p>If you do not want to lose your work (history from X to
B) nor the work by the other person (history from X to A),
you would need to first fetch the history from the
repository, create a history that contains changes done by
both parties, and push the result back.</p>

<p>You can perform &quot;git pull&quot;, resolve potential
conflicts, and &quot;git push&quot; the result. A &quot;git
pull&quot; will create a merge commit C between commits A
and B.</p>

<p>B---C / / ---X---A</p>

<p>Updating A with the resulting merge commit will
fast-forward and your push will be accepted.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can rebase your change between X and
B on top of A, with &quot;git pull --rebase&quot;, and push
the result back. The rebase will create a new commit D that
builds the change between X and B on top of A.</p>

<p>B D / / ---X---A</p>

<p>Again, updating A with this commit will fast-forward and
your push will be accepted.</p>

<p>There is another common situation where you may
encounter non-fast-forward rejection when you try to push,
and it is possible even when you are pushing into a
repository nobody else pushes into. After you push commit A
yourself (in the first picture in this section), replace it
with &quot;git commit --amend&quot; to produce commit B, and
you try to push it out, because forgot that you have pushed
A out already. In such a case, and only if you are certain
that nobody in the meantime fetched your earlier commit A
(and started building on top of it), you can run &quot;git
push --force&quot; to overwrite it. In other words,
&quot;git push --force&quot; is a method reserved for a case
where you do mean to lose history.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES git push Works like git push &lt;remote&gt;,
where &lt;remote&gt; is the current branch s remote (or
origin, if no remote is configured for the current
branch).</p>

<p>git push origin Without additional configuration, works
like git push origin :.</p>

<p>The default behavior of this command when no
&lt;refspec&gt; is given can be configured by setting the
push option of the remote.</p>

<p>For example, to default to pushing only the current
branch to origin use git config remote.origin.push HEAD. Any
valid &lt;refspec&gt; (like the ones in the examples below)
can be configured as the default for git push origin.</p>

<p>git push origin Push &quot;matching&quot; branches to
origin. See &lt;refspec&gt; in the OPTIONS section above for
a description of &quot;matching&quot; branches.</p>

<p>git push origin master Find a ref that matches master in
the source repository (most likely, it would find
refs/heads/master), and update the same ref (e.g.
refs/heads/master) in origin repository with it. If master
did not exist remotely, it would be created.</p>

<p>git push origin HEAD A handy way to push the current
branch to the same name on the remote.</p>

<p>git push origin master:satellite/master
dev:satellite/dev Use the source ref that matches master
(e.g. refs/heads/master) to update the ref that matches
satellite/master (most probably
refs/remotes/satellite/master) in the origin repository,
then do the same for dev and satellite/dev.</p>

<p>git push origin HEAD:master Push the current branch to
the remote ref matching master in the origin repository.
This form is convenient to push the current branch without
thinking about its local name.</p>

<p>git push origin master:refs/heads/experimental Create
the branch experimental in the origin repository by copying
the current master branch. This form is only needed to
create a new branch or tag in the remote repository when the
local name and the remote name are different; otherwise, the
ref name on its own will work.</p>

<p>git push origin :experimental Find a ref that matches
experimental in the origin repository (e.g.
refs/heads/experimental), and delete it.</p>

<p>git push origin +dev:master Update the origin
repositorys master branch with the dev branch, allowing
non-fast-forward updates. This can leave unreferenced
commits dangling in the origin repository. Consider the
following situation, where a fast-forward is not
possible:</p>

<p>o---o---o---A---B origin/master X---Y---Z dev</p>

<p>The above command would change the origin repository
to</p>

<p>A---B (unnamed branch) / o---o---o---X---Y---Z
master</p>

<p>Commits A and B would no longer belong to a branch with
a symbolic name, and so would be unreachable. As such, these
commits would be removed by a git gc command on the origin
repository.</p>
