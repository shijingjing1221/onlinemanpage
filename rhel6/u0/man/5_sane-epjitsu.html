<p>sane-epjitsu(5) SANE Scanner Access Now Easy
sane-epjitsu(5)</p>

<p>NAME sane-epjitsu - SANE backend for Epson-based Fujitsu
USB scanners.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sane-epjitsu library implements a SANE
(Scanner Access Now Easy) backend which provides basic
access the Fujitsu fi-60F and ScanSnap S300/S1300
scanners.</p>

<p>HARDWARE SUPPORT These scanners are fairly limited, only
supporting a couple of modes and resolutions, and always
scanning full width. The backend supports missing modes
(binary, grayscale) in software, but makes no effort to
offer intermediate resolutions or scan area controls. See
KNOWN ISSUES.</p>

<p>This backend may support other scanners. If physical
inspection reveals an Epson chipset, please contact the
author for instructions on col- lecting a USB trace under
Windows to verify.</p>

<p>OPTIONS A limited effort has been made to expose the
standard options to the API. This allows a frontend to set
resolution, color mode, and choose the ADF setting. The
epjitsu backend supports the following basic options for
most scanners:</p>

<p>source s Selects the source for the scan. Options may
include &quot;Flatbed&quot;, &quot;ADF Front&quot;,
&quot;ADF Back&quot;, &quot;ADF Duplex&quot;.</p>

<p>mode m Selects the mode for the scan. Options may
include &quot;Lineart&quot;, &quot;Gray&quot;,
&quot;Color&quot;.</p>

<p>resolution, y-resolution Controls scan resolution.
Setting --resolution also sets --y-resolution, though this
behavior is overridden by some fron- tends.</p>

<p>Other options will be available based on the
capabilities of the scan- ner. Use scanimage --help to get a
list. Be aware that some options may appear only when
another option has been set, and that advanced options may
be hidden by the frontend.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION FILE The configuration file
&quot;/etc/sane.d/epjitsu.conf&quot; is used to tell the
backend how to look for scanners, and provide options
controlling the operation of the backend. This file is read
each time the frontend asks the backend for a list of
scanners, generally only when the frontend starts. If the
configuration file is missing, the backend will not
work.</p>

<p>Scanners can be specified in the configuration file in
two ways:</p>

<p>&quot;usb 0x04c5 0x10c7&quot; (or other vendor/product
ids) Requests backend to search all usb busses in the system
for a device which uses that vendor and product id. The
device will then be queried to determine if it is a
supported scanner.</p>

<p>&quot;usb /dev/usb/scanner0&quot; (or other device file)
Some systems use a kernel driver to access usb scanners.
This method is untested.</p>

<p>The only configuration option supported is
&quot;firmware /PATH/TO/FILE&quot;, allowing you to set the
location of the firmware file you have extracted from the
Windows driver.</p>

<p>Note: This firmware is a copyrighted work of Fujitsu, so
cannot be pro- vided by the backend or the author. Please do
not ask.</p>

<p>Note: These scanners REQUIRE a firmware file to
function. See the sup- plied configuration file for more
detail.</p>

<p>Note: This option may appear multiple times in the
configuration file. It only applies to scanners discovered
by usb lines that follow this option.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT The backend uses a single environment
variable, SANE_DEBUG_EPJITSU, which enables debugging output
to stderr. Valid values are:</p>

<p>5 Errors 10 Function trace 15 Function detail 20 Option
commands 25 USB trace 30 USB detail 35 Useless noise</p>

<p>KNOWN ISSUES No scan area options are exposed. fi-60F
hardware grayscale mode is not used.</p>
