<p>VIRT-DF(1) Virtualization Support VIRT-DF(1)</p>

<p>NAME virt-df - Display free space on virtual
filesystems</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS virt-df [--options]</p>

<p>virt-df [--options] domname</p>

<p>virt-df [--options] disk.img [disk.img ...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION &quot;virt-df&quot; is a command line tool
to display free space on virtual machine filesystems. Unlike
other tools, it doesnt just display the amount of space
allocated to a virtual machine, but can look inside the
virtual machine to see how much space is really being
used.</p>

<p>It is like the df(1) command, but for virtual machines,
except that it also works for Windows virtual machines.</p>

<p>If used without any arguments, &quot;virt-df&quot;
checks with libvirt to get a list of all active and inactive
guests, and performs a &quot;df&quot;-type operation on each
one in turn, printing out the results.</p>

<p>If used with any argument(s), &quot;virt-df&quot;
performs a &quot;df&quot;-type operation on either the
single named libvirt domain, or on the disk image(s) listed
on the command line (which must all belong to a single VM).
In this mode (with arguments), &quot;virt-df&quot; will only
work for a single guest. If you want to run on multiple
guests, then you have to invoke &quot;virt-df&quot; multiple
times.</p>

<p>Use the &quot;--csv&quot; option to get a format which
can be easily parsed by other programs. Other options are
mostly similar to standard &quot;df&quot; options. See below
for the complete list.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --help Display brief help.</p>

<p>--version Display version number and exit.</p>

<p>--connect URI | -c URI If using libvirt, connect to the
given URI. If omitted, then we connect to the default
libvirt hypervisor.</p>

<p>If you specify guest block devices directly, then
libvirt is not used at all.</p>

<p>--csv Write out the results in CSV format
(comma-separated values). This format can be imported easily
into databases and spreadsheets, but read &quot;NOTE ABOUT
CSV FORMAT&quot; below.</p>

<p>--human-readable | -h Print sizes in human-readable
format.</p>

<p>--inodes | -i Print inodes instead of blocks.</p>

<p>NOTE ABOUT CSV FORMAT Comma-separated values (CSV) is a
deceptive format. It seems like it should be easy to parse,
but it is definitely not easy to parse.</p>

<p>Myth: Just split fields at commas. Reality: This does
not work reliably. This example has two columns:</p>

<p>&quot;foo,bar&quot;,baz</p>

<p>Myth: Read the file one line at a time. Reality: This
does not work reliably. This example has one row:</p>

<p>&quot;foo bar&quot;,baz</p>

<p>For shell scripts, use &quot;csvtool&quot;
(&lt;http://merjis.com/developers/csv&gt; also packaged in
major Linux distributions).</p>

<p>For other languages, use a CSV processing library (eg.
&quot;Text::CSV&quot; for Perl or Pythons built-in csv
library).</p>

<p>Most spreadsheets and databases can import CSV
directly.</p>
