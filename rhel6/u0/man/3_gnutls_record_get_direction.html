<p>gnutls_record_get_direction(3) gnutls
gnutls_record_get_direction(3)</p>

<p>NAME gnutls_record_get_direction - return the direction
of the last inter- rupted function call</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;gnutls/gnutls.h&gt;</p>

<p>int gnutls_record_get_direction(gnutls_session_t
session);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS gnutls_session_t session is a gnutls_session_t
structure.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This function provides information about the
internals of the record protocol and is only useful if a
prior gnutls function call (e.g. gnutls_handshake()) was
interrupted for some reason, that is, if a function returned
GNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED or GNUTLS_E_AGAIN. In such a case, you
might want to call select() or poll() before calling the
interrupted gnutls function again. To tell you whether a
file descrip- tor should be selected for either reading or
writing, gnutls_record_get_direction() returns 0 if the
interrupted function was trying to read data, and 1 if it
was trying to write data.</p>

<p>RETURNS 0 if trying to read data, 1 if trying to write
data.</p>
