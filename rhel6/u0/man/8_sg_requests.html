<p>SG_REQUESTS(8) SG3_UTILS SG_REQUESTS(8)</p>

<p>NAME sg_requests - send one or more SCSI REQUEST SENSE
commands</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sg_requests [--desc] [--help] [--hex]
[--maxlen=LEN] [--num=NUM] [--progress] [--raw] [--status]
[--time] [--verbose] [--version] DEVICE</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Send SCSI REQUEST SENSE command to DEVICE
and output the parameter data response which is expected to
be in sense data format. Both fixed and descriptor sense
data formats are supported.</p>

<p>Multiple REQUEST SENSE commands can be sent with the
--num=NUM option. This can be used for timing purposes or
monitoring the progress indica- tion.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Arguments to long options are mandatory for
short options as well.</p>

<p>-d, --desc sets the DESC bit in the REQUEST SENSE SCSI
cdb. The DEVICE should return sense data in descriptor
(rather than fixed) for- mat. This will only occur if the
DEVICE recognizes descriptor format (SPC-3 and later). If
the device is pre SPC-3 then set- ting a bit in a reserved
field may cause a check condition sta- tus with an illegal
request sense key, but will most likely be ignored.</p>

<p>-h, --help output the usage message then exit.</p>

<p>-H, --hex output response in ASCII hexadecimal.</p>

<p>-m, --maxlen=LEN where LEN is the (maximum) response
length in bytes. It is placed in the cdbs &quot;allocation
length&quot; field. If not given (or LEN is zero) then 252
is used. The maximum value of LEN is 255 (but SPC-4
recommends 252).</p>

<p>-n, --num=NUM perform NUM SCSI REQUEST SENSE commands,
stopping when either NUM is reached or an error occurs. The
default value for NUM is 1 .</p>

<p>-p, --progress show progress indication (a percentage)
if available. If --num- ber=NUM is given, NUM is greater
than 1 and an initial progress indication was detected then
this utility waits 30 seconds before subsequent checks.
Exits when NUM is reached or there are no more progress
indications. Ignores --hex, --raw and --time options. See
NOTES section below.</p>

<p>-r, --raw output response in binary (to stdout).</p>

<p>-s, --status if the REQUEST SENSE command finished
without error (as indi- cated by its SCSI status) then the
contents of the parameter data are analysed as sense data
and the exit status is set accordingly. The default action
(i.e. when this option is not given) is to ignore the
contents of the parameter data for the purposes of setting
the exit status. Some types of error set a sense key of
&quot;NO SENSE&quot; with non-zero information in the addi-
tional sense code (e.g. the FAILURE PREDICTION THRESHOLD
EXCEEDED group of codes); this results in an exit status
value of 10. If the sense key is &quot;NO SENSE&quot; and
both asc and ascq are zero then the exit status is set to 0
. See the sg3_utils(8) man page for exit status values.</p>

<p>-t, --time time the SCSI REQUEST SENSE command(s) and
calculate the average number of operations per second.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose increase the level of verbosity, (i.e.
debug output). Addition- ally the response (if received) is
output in ASCII-HEX. Use this option multiple times for
greater verbosity.</p>

<p>-V, --version print the version string and then
exit.</p>

<p>NOTES In SCSI 1 and 2 the REQUEST SENSE command was very
important for error and warning processing in SCSI. The
autosense capability rendered this command almost
superfluous.</p>

<p>However recent SCSI drafts (e.g. SPC-4 rev 14 and SBC-3
rev 14) increase the utility of the REQUEST SENSE command.
Idle and standby (low) power conditions can be detected with
this command.</p>

<p>The REQUEST SENSE command is not marked as mandatory in
SPC-3 (i.e. for all SCSI devices) but is marked as mandatory
in SBC-2 (i.e. for disks), SSC-3 (i.e. for tapes) and MMC-4
(i.e. for CD/DVD/HD-DVD/BD drives).</p>

<p>The progress indication is optionally part of the sense
data. When a prior command that takes a long time to
complete (and typically pre- cludes other media access
commands) is still underway, the progress indication can be
used to determine how long before the device returns to its
normal state.</p>

<p>The SCSI FORMAT command for disks used with the IMMED
bit set is an example of an operation that takes a
significant amount of time and precludes other media access
during that time. The IMMED bit set instructs the FORMAT
command to return control to the application client once the
format has commenced (see SBC-3). Several long duration SCSI
commands associated with tape drives also use the progress
indica- tion (see SSC-3).</p>

<p>Early standards suggested that the SCSI TEST UNIT READY
command be used for polling the progress indication. More
recent standards seem to sug- gest the SCSI REQUEST SENSE
command should be used instead.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The exit status of sg_requests is 0 when it
is successful. Otherwise see the sg3_utils(8) man page.</p>
