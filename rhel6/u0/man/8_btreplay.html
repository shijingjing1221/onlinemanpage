<p>BTREPLAY(8) BTREPLAY(8)</p>

<p>NAME btreplay - recreate IO loads recorded by
blktrace</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS btreplay [ options ] &lt;dev...&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The btrecord and btreplay tools provide the
ability to record and replay IOs captured by the blktrace
utility. Attempts are made to main- tain ordering, CPU
mappings and time-separation of IOs.</p>

<p>The blktrace utility provides the ability to collect
detailed traces from the kernel for each IO processed by the
block IO layer. The traces provide a complete timeline for
each IO processed, including detailed information concerning
when an IO was first received by the block IO layer
indicating the device, CPU number, time stamp, IO direction,
sector number and IO size (number of sectors). Using this
information, one is able to replay the IO again on the same
machine or another set up entirely.</p>

<p>The basic operating work-flow to replay IOs would be
something like:</p>

<p>- Run blktrace to collect traces. Here you specify the
device or devices that you wish to trace and later replay
IOs upon. Note: the only traces you are interested in are
QUEUE requests thus, to save system resources (including
storage for traces), one could specify the -a queue command
line option to blktrace.</p>

<p>- While blktrace is running, you run the workload that
you are interested in.</p>

<p>- When the work load has completed, you stop the
blktrace utility (thus saving all traces over the complete
workload).</p>

<p>- You extract the pertinent IO information from the
traces saved by blktrace using the btrecord utility. This
will parse each trace file created by blktrace, and crafty
IO descriptions to be used in the next phase of the workload
processing.</p>

<p>- Once btrecord has successfully created a series of
data files to be processed, you can run the btreplay utility
which attempts to generate the same IOs seen during the
sample workload phase.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -c &lt;num&gt; --cpus=&lt;num&gt; Set number of
CPUs to use.</p>

<p>-d &lt;dir&gt; --input-directory=&lt;dir&gt; Set input
directory. This option requires a single parameter providing
the directory name for where input files are to be found.
The default directory is the current directory (.).</p>

<p>-F --find-records Find record files automatically This
option instructs btreplay to go find all the record files in
the directory specified (either via the -d option, or in the
default directory (.).</p>

<p>-h --help Show help and exit.</p>

<p>-i &lt;basename&gt; --input-base=&lt;basename&gt; Set
base name for input files. Each input file has 3 fields:</p>

<p>1. Device identifier (taken directly from the device
name of the blktrace output file).</p>

<p>2. btrecord base name by default replay.</p>

<p>3. The CPU number (again, taken directly from the
blktrace output file name).</p>

<p>This option requires a single parameter that will
override the default name (replay), and replace it with the
specified value.</p>

<p>-I &lt;num&gt; --iterations=&lt;num&gt; Set number of
iterations to run. This option requires a single parameter
which specifies the number of times to run through the input
files. The default value is 1</p>

<p>-M &lt;filename&gt; --map-devs=&lt;filename&gt; Specify
device mappings. This option requires a single parame- ter
which specifies the name of a file contain device mappings.
The file must be very simply managed, with just two pieces
of data per line:</p>

<p>- The device name on the recorded system (with the /dev/
removed). Example: /dev/sda would just be sda.</p>

<p>- The device name on the replay system to use (again,
without the /dev/ path prepended).</p>

<p>An example file for when one would map devices /dev/sda
and /dev/sdb on the recorded system to dev/sdg and sdh on
the replay system would be:</p>

<p>sda sdg sdb sdh</p>

<p>The only entries in the file that are allowed are these
two element lines we do not (yet?) support the notion of
blank lines, or comment lines, or the like.</p>

<p>The utility allows for multiple -M options to be
supplied on the command line.</p>

<p>-N --no-stalls Disable pre-bunch stalls. When specified
on the command line, all pre-bunch stall indicators will be
ignored. IOs will be replayed without inter-bunch
delays.</p>

<p>-v --verbose Enable verbose output. When specified on
the command line, this option instructs btreplay to store
information concerning each stall and IO operation performed
by btreplay. The name of each file so created will be the
input file name used with an exten- sion of .rep appended
onto it. Thus, an input file of the name sdab.replay.3 would
generate a verbose output file with the name
sdab.replay.3.rep in the directory specified for input
files.</p>

<p>In addition, btreplay will also output to stderr the
names of the input files being processed.</p>

<p>-V --version Show version number and exit.</p>

<p>-W --write-enable Enable writing during replay. As a
precautionary measure, by default btreplay will not process
write requests. In order to enable btreplay to actually
write to devices one must explicitly specify the -W
option.</p>
