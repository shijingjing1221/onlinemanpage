<p>DESCRIPTION Submodules allow foreign repositories to be
embedded within a dedicated subdirectory of the source tree,
always pointed at a particular commit.</p>

<p>They are not to be confused with remotes, which are
meant mainly for branches of the same project; submodules
are meant for different projects you would like to make part
of your source tree, while the history of the two projects
still stays completely independent and you cannot modify the
contents of the submodule from within the main project. If
you want to merge the project histories and want to treat
the aggregated whole as a single project from then on, you
may want to add a remote for the other project and use the
subtree merge strategy, instead of treating the other
project as a submodule. Directories that come from both
projects can be cloned and checked out as a whole if you
choose to go that route.</p>

<p>Submodules are composed from a so-called gitlink tree
entry in the main repository that refers to a particular
commit object within the inner repository that is completely
separate. A record in the .gitmodules file at the root of
the source tree assigns a logical name to the submodule and
describes the default URL the submodule shall be cloned
from. The logical name can be used for overriding this URL
within your local repository configuration (see submodule
init).</p>

<p>This command will manage the tree entries and contents
of the gitmodules file for you, as well as inspect the
status of your submodules and update them. When adding a new
submodule to the tree, the add subcommand is to be used.
However, when pulling a tree containing submodules, these
will not be checked out by default; the init and update
subcommands will maintain submodules checked out and at
appropriate revision in your working tree. You can briefly
inspect the up-to-date status of your submodules using the
status subcommand and get a detailed overview of the
difference between the index and checkouts using the summary
subcommand.</p>

<p>COMMANDS add Add the given repository as a submodule at
the given path to the changeset to be committed next to the
current project: the current project is termed the
&quot;superproject&quot;.</p>

<p>This requires at least one argument: &lt;repository&gt;.
The optional argument &lt;path&gt; is the relative location
for the cloned submodule to exist in the superproject. If
&lt;path&gt; is not given, the &quot;humanish&quot; part of
the source repository is used (&quot;repo&quot; for
&quot;/path/to/repo.git&quot; and &quot;foo&quot; for
&quot;host.xz:foo/.git&quot;).</p>

<p>&lt;repository&gt; is the URL of the new submodules
origin repository. This may be either an absolute URL, or
(if it begins with ./ or ../), the location relative to the
superprojects origin repository.</p>

<p>&lt;path&gt; is the relative location for the cloned
submodule to exist in the superproject. If &lt;path&gt; does
not exist, then the submodule is created by cloning from the
named URL. If &lt;path&gt; does exist and is already a valid
git repository, then this is added to the changeset without
cloning. This second form is provided to ease creating a new
submodule from scratch, and presumes the user will later
push the submodule to the given URL.</p>

<p>In either case, the given URL is recorded into
.gitmodules for use by subsequent users cloning the
superproject. If the URL is given relative to the
superproject s repository, the presumption is the
superproject and submodule repositories will be kept
together in the same relative location, and only the
superprojects URL needs to be provided: git-submodule will
correctly locate the submodule using the relative URL in
.gitmodules.</p>

<p>status Show the status of the submodules. This will
print the SHA-1 of the currently checked out commit for each
submodule, along with the submodule path and the output of
git describe for the SHA-1. Each SHA-1 will be prefixed with
- if the submodule is not initialized and + if the currently
checked out submodule commit does not match the SHA-1 found
in the index of the containing repository. This command is
the default command for git submodule.</p>

<p>If --recursive is specified, this command will recurse
into nested submodules, and show their status as well.</p>

<p>init Initialize the submodules, i.e. register each
submodule name and url found in .gitmodules into
.git/config. The key used in .git/config is
submodule.$name.url. This command does not alter existing
information in .git/config. You can then customize the
submodule clone URLs in .git/config for your local setup and
proceed to git submodule update; you can also just use git
submodule update --init without the explicit init step if
you do not intend to customize any submodule locations.</p>

<p>update Update the registered submodules, i.e. clone
missing submodules and checkout the commit specified in the
index of the containing repository. This will make the
submodules HEAD be detached unless --rebase or --merge is
specified or the key submodule.$name.update is set to rebase
or merge.</p>

<p>If the submodule is not yet initialized, and you just
want to use the setting as stored in .gitmodules, you can
automatically initialize the submodule with the --init
option.</p>

<p>If --recursive is specified, this command will recurse
into the registered submodules, and update any nested
submodules within.</p>

<p>summary Show commit summary between the given commit
(defaults to HEAD) and working tree/index. For a submodule
in question, a series of commits in the submodule between
the given super project commit and the index or working tree
(switched by --cached) are shown. If the option --files is
given, show the series of commits in the submodule between
the index of the super project and the working tree of the
submodule (this option doesnt allow to use the --cached
option or to provide an explicit commit).</p>

<p>foreach Evaluates an arbitrary shell command in each
checked out submodule. The command has access to the
variables $name, $path and $sha1: $name is the name of the
relevant submodule section in .gitmodules, $path is the name
of the submodule directory relative to the superproject, and
$sha1 is the commit as recorded in the superproject. Any
submodules defined in the superproject but not checked out
are ignored by this command. Unless given --quiet, foreach
prints the name of each submodule before evaluating the
command. If --recursive is given, submodules are traversed
recursively (i.e. the given shell command is evaluated in
nested submodules as well). A non-zero return from the
command in any submodule causes the processing to terminate.
This can be overridden by adding || : to the end of the
command.</p>

<p>As an example, git submodule foreach &acute;echo $path
git rev-parse HEAD&acute; will show the path and currently
checked out commit for each submodule.</p>

<p>sync Synchronizes submodules&acute; remote URL
configuration setting to the value specified in .gitmodules.
This is useful when submodule URLs change upstream and you
need to update your local repositories accordingly.</p>

<p>&quot;git submodule sync&quot; synchronizes all
submodules while &quot;git submodule sync A&quot;
synchronizes submodule &quot;A&quot; only.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -q, --quiet Only print error messages.</p>

<p>-b, --branch Branch of repository to add as
submodule.</p>

<p>--cached This option is only valid for status and
summary commands. These commands typically use the commit
found in the submodule HEAD, but with this option, the
commit stored in the index is used instead.</p>

<p>--files This option is only valid for the summary
command. This command compares the commit in the index with
that in the submodule HEAD when this option is used.</p>

<p>-n, --summary-limit This option is only valid for the
summary command. Limit the summary size (number of commits
shown in total). Giving 0 will disable the summary; a
negative number means unlimited (the default). This limit
only applies to modified submodules. The size is always
limited to 1 for added/deleted/typechanged submodules.</p>

<p>-N, --no-fetch This option is only valid for the update
command. Dont fetch new objects from the remote site.</p>

<p>--merge This option is only valid for the update
command. Merge the commit recorded in the superproject into
the current branch of the submodule. If this option is
given, the submodule s HEAD will not be detached. If a merge
failure prevents this process, you will have to resolve the
resulting conflicts within the submodule with the usual
conflict resolution tools. If the key submodule.$name.update
is set to merge, this option is implicit.</p>

<p>--rebase This option is only valid for the update
command. Rebase the current branch onto the commit recorded
in the superproject. If this option is given, the submodules
HEAD will not be detached. If a merge failure prevents this
process, you will have to resolve these failures with
git-rebase(1). If the key submodule.$name.update is set to
rebase, this option is implicit.</p>

<p>--reference &lt;repository&gt; This option is only valid
for add and update commands. These commands sometimes need
to clone a remote repository. In this case, this option will
be passed to the git-clone(1) command.</p>

<p>NOTE: Do not use this option unless you have read the
note for git- clone(1)&acute;s --reference and --shared
options carefully.</p>

<p>--recursive This option is only valid for foreach,
update and status commands. Traverse submodules recursively.
The operation is performed not only in the submodules of the
current repo, but also in any nested submodules inside those
submodules (and so on).</p>

<p>&lt;path&gt;... Paths to submodule(s). When specified
this will restrict the command to only operate on the
submodules found at the specified paths. (This argument is
required with add).</p>

<p>FILES When initializing submodules, a .gitmodules file
in the top-level directory of the containing repository is
used to find the url of each submodule. This file should be
formatted in the same way as $GIT_DIR/config. The key to
each submodule url is &quot;submodule.$name.url&quot;. See
gitmodules(5) for details.</p>
