<p>FILENO(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual FILENO(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME fileno - map a stream pointer to a file
descriptor</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</p>

<p>int fileno(FILE *stream);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The fileno() function shall return the
integer file descriptor associ- ated with the stream pointed
to by stream.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, fileno() shall
return the integer value of the file descriptor associated
with stream. Otherwise, the value -1 shall be returned and
errno set to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The fileno() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EBADF The stream argument is not a valid stream.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE Without some specification of which file
descriptors are associated with these streams, it is
impossible for an application to set up the streams for
another application it starts with fork() and exec. In par-
ticular, it would not be possible to write a portable
version of the sh command interpreter (although there may be
other constraints that would prevent that portability).</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>

I/O Streams, fdopen(), fopen(), stdin(), the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,
