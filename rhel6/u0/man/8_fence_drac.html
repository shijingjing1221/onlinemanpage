<p>NAME fence_drac - fencing agent for Dell Remote Access
Card</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS fence_drac [OPTION]...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION fence_drac is an I/O Fencing agent which can
be used with the Dell Remote Access Card (DRAC). This card
provides remote access to con- trolling power to a server.
It logs into the DRAC through the telnet interface of the
card. By default, the telnet interface is not enabled. To
enable the interface, you will need to use the racadm com-
mand in the racser-devel rpm available from Dell. To enable
telnet on the DRAC:</p>

<p>[root]# racadm config -g cfgSerial -o
cfgSerialTelnetEnable 1</p>

<p>[root]# racadm racreset</p>

<p>fence_drac accepts options on the command line as well
as from stdin. Fenced sends parameters through stdin when it
execs the agent. fence_drac can be run by itself with
command line options. This is useful for testing and for
turning outlets on or off from scripts.</p>
