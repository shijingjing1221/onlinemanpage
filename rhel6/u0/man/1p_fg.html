<p>FG(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual FG(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME fg - run jobs in the foreground</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS fg [job_id]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION If job control is enabled (see the
description of set -m), the fg util- ity shall move a
background job from the current environment (see Shell
Execution Environment ) into the foreground.</p>

<p>Using fg to place a job into the foreground shall remove
its process ID from the list of those &quot;known in the
current shell execution environ- ment; see Asynchronous
Lists .</p>

<p>OPTIONS None.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p>job_id Specify the job to be run as a foreground job. If
no job_id operand is given, the job_id for the job that was
most recently suspended, placed in the background, or run as
a background job shall be used. The format of job_id is
described in the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001, Section 3.203, Job Control Job ID.</p>

<p>STDIN Not used.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of fg:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in
arguments).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT The fg utility shall write the command line of
the job to standard out- put in the following format:</p>

<p>&quot;%n&quot;, &lt;command&gt;</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 Successful completion.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS If job control is disabled, the
fg utility shall exit with an error and no job shall be
placed in the foreground.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The fg utility does not work as
expected when it is operating in its own utility execution
environment because that environment has no applicable jobs
to manipulate. See the APPLICATION USAGE section for bg .
For this reason, fg is generally implemented as a shell
regular built-in.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The extensions to the shell specified in this
volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 have mostly been based on
features provided by the KornShell. The job control features
provided by bg, fg, and jobs are also based on the
KornShell. The standard developers examined the char-
acteristics of the C shell versions of these utilities and
found that differences exist. Despite widespread use of the
C shell, the KornShell versions were selected for this
volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 to main- tain a degree of
uniformity with the rest of the KornShell features selected
(such as the very popular command line editing
features).</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
