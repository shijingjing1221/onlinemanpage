<p>NAME MrmRegisterNames Registers the values associated
with the names ref- erenced in UIL (for example, UIL
callback function names or UIL identi- fier names)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;Mrm/MrmPublic.h&gt; Cardinal
MrmRegisterNames( MrmRegisterArglist register_list, MrmCount
register_count);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The MrmRegisterNames function registers a
vector of names and associ- ated values for access in MRM.
The values can be callback functions, pointers to
user-defined data, or any other values. The information
provided is used to resolve symbolic references occurring in
UID files to their run-time values. For callbacks, this
information provides the procedure address required by the
Motif Toolkit. For names used as identifiers in UIL, this
information provides any run-time mapping the application
needs.</p>

<p>This function is similar to MrmRegisterNamesInHierarchy,
except that the scope of the names registered by
MrmRegisterNamesInHierarchy is limited to the hierarchy
specified in the call to that function, whereas the names
registered by MrmRegisterNames have global scope. When MRM
looks up a name, it first tries to find the name among those
registered for the given hierarchy. If that lookup fails, it
tries to find the name among those registered globally.</p>

<p>register_list Specifies a list of name/value pairs for
the names to be reg- istered. Each name is a case-sensitive,
NULL-terminated ASCII string. Each value is a 32-bit
quantity, interpreted as a procedure address if the name is
a callback function, and uninterpreted otherwise.</p>

<p>register_count Specifies the number of entries in
register_list.</p>

<p>The names in the list are case-sensitive. The list can
be either ordered or unordered.</p>

<p>Callback functions registered through MrmRegisterNames
can be either regular or creation callbacks. Regular
callbacks have declarations determined by Motif Toolkit and
user requirements. Creation callbacks have the same format
as any other callback:</p>

<p>void CallBackProc( Widget *widget_id, Opaque tag,
XmAnyCallbackStruct *callback_data);</p>

<p>widget_id Specifies the widget ID associated with the
widget performing the callback (as in any callback
function).</p>

<p>tag Specifies the tag value (as in any callback
function).</p>

<p>callback_data Specifies a widget-specific data
structure. This data struc- ture has a minimum of two
members: event and reason. The reason member is always set
to MrmCR_CREATE.</p>

<p>Note that the widget name and parent are available from
the widget record accessible through widget_id.</p>

<p>RETURN This function returns one of the following status
return constants:</p>

<p>MrmSUCCESS The function executed successfully.</p>

<p>MrmFAILURE The function failed.</p>
