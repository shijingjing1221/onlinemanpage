<p>SDL_UpdateRects(3) SDL API Reference
SDL_UpdateRects(3)</p>

<p>NAME SDL_UpdateRects - Makes sure the given list of
rectangles is updated on the given screen.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &quot;SDL.h&quot;</p>

<p>void SDL_UpdateRects(SDL_Surface *screen, int numrects,
SDL_Rect *rects);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Makes sure the given list of rectangles is
updated on the given screen. The rectangles must all be
confined within the screen boundaries (no clipping is
done).</p>

<p>This function should not be called while screen is
locked.</p>

<p>Note:</p>

<p>It is adviced to call this function only once per frame,
since each call has some processing overhead. This is no
restriction since you can pass any number of rectangles each
time.</p>

<p>The rectangles are not automatically merged or checked
for over- lap. In general, the programmer can use his
knowledge about his particular rectangles to merge them in
an efficient way, to avoid overdraw.</p>

SDL_LockSurface</p>
