<p>NAME X.Org, XProjectTeam - X.Org Group information</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS Release 6.5 and 6.6 of X Version 11 was brought
to you by The X.Org Group. Release 6.4 of X Version 11 was
brought to you by The X Project Team.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The Open Groups X Project Team was created
as the successor to the X Consortium, Inc., after the X
Consortium ceased operations and trans- ferred ownership of
X11 to The Open Group. The X.Org Group (hereinafter called
&quot;X.Org&quot;) was created as the successor to The X
Project Team after the The Open Group ceased operating The X
Project Team. The pur- pose of X.Org was to foster
development, evolution, and maintenance of the X Window
System. X.Org operates under the corporate umbrella of The
Open Group.</p>

<p>The X Consortium was an independent, not-for-profit
Delaware membership corporation. It was formed in 1993 as
the successor to the MIT X Con- sortium.</p>

<p>The X Window System was created in the mid-1980s at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In 1988, MIT formed a
member-funded consor- tium to provide the technical and
administrative leadership necessary to support further
development of the X Window System. In 1992, MIT and the
membership decided it was in their best interests to move
the consortium out of MIT and create an independent,
stand-alone organiza- tion. All rights to the X Window
System were assigned by MIT to X Con- sortium, Inc. on
January 1, 1994. On December 31, 1996 the X Consor- tium,
Inc. closed its doors and all rights to the X Window System
were assigned to The Open Group.</p>
