<p>PAM(3) Linux-PAM Manual PAM(3)</p>

<p>NAME pam - Pluggable Authentication Modules Library</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;security/pam_appl.h&gt;</p>

<p>#include &lt;security/pam_modules.h&gt;</p>

<p>#include &lt;security/pam_ext.h&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION PAM is a system of libraries that handle the
authentication tasks of applications (services) on the
system. The library provides a stable general interface
(Application Programming Interface - API) that privilege
granting programs (such as login(1) and su(1)) defer to to
perform standard authentication tasks.</p>

<p>Initialization and Cleanup The pam_start(3) function
creates the PAM context and initiates the PAM transaction.
It is the first of the PAM functions that needs to be called
by an application. The transaction state is contained
entirely within the structure identified by this handle, so
it is possible to have multiple transactions in parallel.
But it is not possible to use the same handle for different
transactions, a new one is needed for every new context.</p>

<p>The pam_end(3) function terminates the PAM transaction
and is the last function an application should call in the
PAM context. Upon return the handle pamh is no longer valid
and all memory associated with it will be invalid. It can be
called at any time to terminate a PAM transaction.</p>

<p>Authentication The pam_authenticate(3) function is used
to authenticate the user. The user is required to provide an
authentication token depending upon the authentication
service, usually this is a password, but could also be a
finger print.</p>

<p>The pam_setcred(3) function manages the
userscredentials.</p>

<p>Account Management The pam_acct_mgmt(3) function is used
to determine if the users account is valid. It checks for
authentication token and account expiration and verifies
access restrictions. It is typically called after the user
has been authenticated.</p>

<p>Password Management The pam_chauthtok(3) function is
used to change the authentication token for a given user on
request or because the token has expired.</p>

<p>Session Management The pam_open_session(3) function sets
up a user session for a previously successful authenticated
user. The session should later be terminated with a call to
pam_close_session(3).</p>

<p>Conversation The PAM library uses an application-defined
callback to allow a direct communication between a loaded
module and the application. This callback is specified by
the struct pam_conv passed to pam_start(3) at the start of
the transaction. See pam_conv(3) for details.</p>

<p>Data Objects The pam_set_item(3) and pam_get_item(3)
functions allows applications and PAM service modules to set
and retrieve PAM informations.</p>

<p>The pam_get_user(3) function is the preferred method to
obtain the username.</p>

<p>The pam_set_data(3) and pam_get_data(3) functions allows
PAM service modules to set and retrieve free-form data from
one invocation to another.</p>

<p>Environment and Error Management The pam_putenv(3),
pam_getenv(3) and pam_getenvlist(3) functions are for
maintaining a set of private environment variables.</p>

<p>The pam_strerror(3) function returns a pointer to a
string describing the given PAM error code.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUES The following return codes are known by
PAM:</p>

<p>PAM_ABORT Critical error, immediate abort.</p>

<p>PAM_ACCT_EXPIRED User account has expired.</p>

<p>PAM_AUTHINFO_UNAVAIL Authentication service cannot
retrieve authentication info.</p>

<p>PAM_AUTHTOK_DISABLE_AGING Authentication token aging
disabled.</p>

<p>PAM_AUTHTOK_ERR Authentication token manipulation
error.</p>

<p>PAM_AUTHTOK_EXPIRED Authentication token expired.</p>

<p>PAM_AUTHTOK_LOCK_BUSY Authentication token lock
busy.</p>

<p>PAM_AUTHTOK_RECOVERY_ERR Authentication information
cannot be recovered.</p>

<p>PAM_AUTH_ERR Authentication failure.</p>

<p>PAM_BUF_ERR Memory buffer error.</p>

<p>PAM_CONV_ERR Conversation failure.</p>

<p>PAM_CRED_ERR Failure setting user credentials.</p>

<p>PAM_CRED_EXPIRED User credentials expired.</p>

<p>PAM_CRED_INSUFFICIENT Insufficient credentials to access
authentication data.</p>

<p>PAM_CRED_UNAVAIL Authentication service cannot retrieve
user credentials.</p>

<p>PAM_IGNORE The return value should be ignored by PAM
dispatch.</p>

<p>PAM_MAXTRIES Have exhausted maximum number of retries
for service.</p>

<p>PAM_MODULE_UNKNOWN Module is unknown.</p>

<p>PAM_NEW_AUTHTOK_REQD Authentication token is no longer
valid; new one required.</p>

<p>PAM_NO_MODULE_DATA No module specific data is
present.</p>

<p>PAM_OPEN_ERR Failed to load module.</p>

<p>PAM_PERM_DENIED Permission denied.</p>

<p>PAM_SERVICE_ERR Error in service module.</p>

<p>PAM_SESSION_ERR Cannot make/remove an entry for the
specified session.</p>

<p>PAM_SUCCESS Success.</p>

<p>PAM_SYMBOL_ERR Symbol not found.</p>

<p>PAM_SYSTEM_ERR System error.</p>

<p>PAM_TRY_AGAIN Failed preliminary check by password
service.</p>

<p>PAM_USER_UNKNOWN User not known to the underlying
authentication module.</p>
