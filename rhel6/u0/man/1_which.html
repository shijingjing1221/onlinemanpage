<p>WHICH(1) WHICH(1)</p>

<p>NAME which - shows the full path of (shell)
commands.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS which [options] [--] programname [...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Which takes one or more arguments. For each
of its arguments it prints to stdout the full path of the
executables that would have been exe- cuted when this
argument had been entered at the shell prompt. It does this
by searching for an executable or script in the directories
listed in the environment variable PATH using the same
algorithm as bash(1).</p>

<p>This man page is generated from the file
which.texinfo.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --all, -a Print all matching executables in
PATH, not just the first.</p>

<p>--read-alias, -i Read aliases from stdin, reporting
matching ones on stdout. This is useful in combination with
using an alias for which itself. For example alias
which=&acute;alias | which -i&acute;.</p>

<p>--skip-alias Ignore option &lsquo;--read-alias&acute;,
if any. This is useful to explicity search for normal
binaries, while using the &lsquo;--read-alias&acute; option
in an alias or function for which.</p>

<p>--read-functions Read shell function definitions from
stdin, reporting matching ones on stdout. This is useful in
combination with using a shell func- tion for which itself.
For example: which() { declare -f | which --read-functions
$@ } export -f which</p>

<p>--skip-functions Ignore option
&lsquo;--read-functions&acute;, if any. This is useful to
explic- ity search for normal binaries, while using the
&lsquo;--read-functions&acute; option in an alias or
function for which.</p>

<p>--skip-dot Skip directories in PATH that start with a
dot.</p>

<p>--skip-tilde Skip directories in PATH that start with a
tilde and executables which reside in the HOME
directory.</p>

<p>--show-dot If a directory in PATH starts with a dot and
a matching executable was found for that path, then print
&quot;./programname&quot; rather than the full path.</p>

<p>--show-tilde Output a tilde when a directory matches the
HOME directory. This option is ignored when which is invoked
as root.</p>

<p>--tty-only Stop processing options on the right if not
on tty.</p>

<p>--version,-v,-V Print version information on standard
output then exit success- fully.</p>

<p>--help Print usage information on standard output then
exit successfully.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Which returns the number of failed
arguments, or -1 when no &lsquo;program- name&acute; was
given.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE The recommended way to use this utility is by
adding an alias (C shell) or shell function (Bourne shell)
for which like the following:</p>

<p>[ba]sh:</p>

<p>which () { (alias; declare -f) | /usr/bin/which
--tty-only --read-alias --read-functions --show-tilde
--show-dot $@ } export -f which</p>

<p>[t]csh:</p>

<p>alias which &acute;alias | /usr/bin/which --tty-only
--read-alias --show-dot --show-tilde&acute;</p>

<p>This will print the readable ~/ and ./ when starting
which from your prompt, while still printing the full path
when used from a script:</p>

<p>&gt; which q2 ~/bin/q2 &gt; echo &lsquo;which q2&lsquo;
/home/carlo/bin/q2</p>

<p>BUGS The HOME directory is determined by looking for the
HOME environment variable, which aborts when this variable
doesn&acute;t exist. Which will consider two equivalent
directories to be different when one of them contains a path
with a symbolic link.</p>
