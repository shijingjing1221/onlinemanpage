<p>UTRACE_SET_EVENTS(9) utrace core API
UTRACE_SET_EVENTS(9)</p>

<p>NAME utrace_set_events - choose which event reports a
tracing engine gets</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS int utrace_set_events(struct task_struct *
target, struct utrace_engine * engine, unsigned long
events);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS target thread to affect</p>

<p>engine attached engine to affect</p>

<p>events new event mask</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This changes the set of events for which
engine wants callbacks made.</p>

<p>This fails with -EALREADY and does nothing if you try to
clear UTRACE_EVENT(DEATH) when the report_death callback may
already have begun, if you try to clear UTRACE_EVENT(REAP)
when the report_reap callback may already have begun, or if
you try to newly set UTRACE_EVENT(DEATH) or
UTRACE_EVENT(QUIESCE) when target is already dead or
dying.</p>

<p>This can fail with -ESRCH when target has already been
detached, including forcible detach on reaping.</p>

<p>If target was stopped before the call, then after a
successful call, no event callbacks not requested in events
will be made; if UTRACE_EVENT(QUIESCE) is included in
events, then a report_quiesce callback will be made when
target resumes.</p>

<p>If target was not stopped and events excludes some bits
that were set before, this can return -EINPROGRESS to
indicate that target may have been making some callback to
engine. When this returns zero, you can be sure that no
event callbacks you&acute;ve disabled in events can be made.
If events only sets new bits that were not set before on
engine, then -EINPROGRESS will never be returned.</p>

<p>To synchronize after an -EINPROGRESS return, see
utrace_barrier.</p>

<p>When target is current, -EINPROGRESS is not returned.
But note that a newly-created engine will not receive any
callbacks related to an event notification already in
progress. This call enables events callbacks to be made as
soon as engine becomes eligible for any callbacks, see
utrace_attach_task.</p>

<p>These rules provide for coherent synchronization based
on UTRACE_STOP, even when SIGKILL is breaking its normal
simple rules.</p>
