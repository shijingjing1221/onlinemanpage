<p>NAME wacom - Wacom input driver</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS Section &quot;InputDevice&quot; Identifier
&quot;idevname&quot; Driver &quot;wacom&quot; Option
&quot;Device&quot; &quot;devpath&quot; ... EndSection</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION wacom is an X input driver for Wacom
devices.</p>

<p>The wacom driver functions as a pointer input device,
and may be used as the X servers core pointer.</p>

<p>SUPPORTED HARDWARE This driver supports the Wacom IV and
Wacom V protocols. Serial tablets only need this driver. USB
tablet support is available on some Linux platforms. USB
tablets needs wacom kernel driver being loaded before this
driver starts. Please check linuxwacom.sf.net for latest
updates of Wacom X and kernel drivers.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION DETAILS Please refer to xorg.conf(5x) for
general configuration details and for options that can be
used with all input drivers. This section only covers
configuration details specific to this driver.</p>

<p>Multiple instances of the Wacom devices can cohabit. It
can be useful to define multiple devices with different
active zones. Each device supports the following
entries:</p>

<p>Option &quot;Type&quot;
&quot;stylus&quot;|&quot;eraser&quot;|&quot;cursor&quot;|&quot;pad&quot;|&quot;touch&quot;
sets the type of tool the device represents. This option is
mandatory. The core options, such as
&quot;SendCoreEvents&quot; or &quot;AlwaysCore&quot;, are
unnecessary in Gimp if you dont need to move system cursor
outside of Gimp drawing area. &quot;pad&quot; is for Intuos
3 or Cintiq 21UX tablet ExpressKeys/menu strips, and
Graphire 4 or Bamboo tablet buttons, wheel, and/or ring. It
is required for Intuos3, CintiqV5, Graphire 4, and Bamboo if
you want to use keystroke features. &quot;pad&quot; is
reported as a second tool in the driver. &quot;touch&quot;
is for the tablet with touch support. Right now only a few
Tablet PCs have this feature.</p>

<p>Option &quot;Device&quot; &quot;path&quot; sets the path
to the special file which represents serial line where the
tablet is plugged. You have to specify it for each
subsection with the same value if you want to have multiple
devices with the same tablet. This option is mandatory.</p>

<p>Option &quot;ForceDevice&quot; &quot;ISDV4&quot; tells
the driver to dialog with the tablet the serial Tablet PC
way. It is a special Wacom IV protocol, called ISDV4
protocol. This option is mandatory for serial Tablet PCs
only.</p>

<p>Option &quot;Suppress&quot; &quot;number&quot; sets the
position increment under which not to transmit coordinates.
This entry must be specified only in the first Wacom
subsection if you have multiple devices for one tablet. If
you dont specify this entry, the default value, which is 2,
will be used. To disable suppression, the entry should be
specified as 0. When suppress is defined, an event will be
sent only when at least one of the following conditions is
met:</p>

<p>the change between the current X coordinate and the
previous one is greater than suppress;</p>

<p>the change between the current Y coordinate and the
previous one is greater than suppress;</p>

<p>the change between the current pressure and the previous
one is greater than suppress;</p>

<p>the change between the current degree of rotation and
the previous one of the transducer is greater than sup-
press;</p>

<p>the change between the current absolute wheel value and
the previous one is equal to or greater than suppress;</p>

<p>the change between the current tilt value and the
previous one is equal to or greater than suppress (if tilt
is supported);</p>

<p>relative wheel value has changed;</p>

<p>button value has changed;</p>

<p>proximity has changed.</p>

<p>Option &quot;Mode&quot;
&quot;Relative&quot;|&quot;Absolute&quot; sets the mode of
the device. The default value for stylus, pad and eraser is
Absolute; cursor is Relative; touch defaults to Relative for
tablets with touch pads and Abso- lute for touch
screens.</p>

<p>Option &quot;TopX&quot; &quot;number&quot; X coordinate
of the top corner of the active zone. Default to 0.</p>

<p>Option &quot;TopY&quot; &quot;number&quot; Y coordinate
of the top corner of the active zone. Default to 0.</p>

<p>Option &quot;BottomX&quot; &quot;number&quot; X
coordinate of the bottom corner of the active zone. Default
to width of the tablet.</p>

<p>Option &quot;BottomY&quot; &quot;number&quot; Y
coordinate of the bottom corner of the active zone. Default
to height of the tablet.</p>

<p>Option &quot;ButtonsOnly&quot;
&quot;on&quot;|&quot;off&quot; disables the devices motion
events. Default to off.</p>

<p>Option &quot;ButtonM&quot; &quot;AC&quot; reports an
action AC when button M is pressed, where M is one of the
device supported button numbers, it can be 1 to 32. Wacom
uses a driver-internal button mapping, where any physical
button appears to the X server as the button specified by
the ButtonM mapping. Hence, if two physical buttons have the
same ButtonM mapping, the server will think they are the
same physical button. The default action reported to the X
server is mouse button M click. Because X uses buttons 4, 5,
6, and 7 as the four scrolling directions, physical buttons
4 and higher are mapped to 8 and higher by default. To
ignore the button click, i.e., to not report any button
click event to the X server, use &quot;0&quot; or
&quot;button 0&quot;.</p>

<p>Option &quot;TPCButton&quot;
&quot;on&quot;|&quot;off&quot; enables the stylus buttons as
Tablet PC buttons, i.e., reports stylus button event only
when its tip is pressed. Default to &quot;on&quot; for
Tablet PCs; &quot;off&quot; for all other models.</p>

<p>Option &quot;Touch&quot; &quot;on&quot;|&quot;off&quot;
enables the touch event for Tablet PC that supports touch
feature, i.e., system cursor moves when user touches the
tablet. Default to &quot;on&quot; for Tablet PCs with touch
feature; &quot;off&quot; for all other models.</p>

<p>Option &quot;Capacity&quot; &quot;number&quot; sets
touch sensitivity level for capacitive touch device, where
number can be an integer from -1 to 5. Default is 3 for
capacitive tools and -1 for none capacitive tools.</p>

<p>Option &quot;Speed&quot; &quot;Rspeed&quot; sets the
cursors relative movement speed to Rspeed. The default value
is 1.0. A Rspeed greater than 1.0 will speed up the cursors
relative movement. A Rspeed less than 1.0 but greater than 0
will slow down the cursors relative movement. A Rspeed too
close to 0 is not recommanded.</p>

<p>Option &quot;Twinview&quot;
&quot;horizontal&quot;|&quot;verti-
cal&quot;|&quot;leftof&quot;|&quot;aboveof&quot;|&quot;xinerama&quot;|&quot;none&quot;
sets the orientation of TwinView to map the tablet to one
screen and to be able to move the screen cursor from one
screen to the other when tool reaches the edge of the
tablet. The cursor can be constrained in a specific screen
if &quot;ScreenNo&quot; option is added. If you want to map
the tablet to the whole desktop, you should NOT add this
option. The default is &quot;none&quot;. Note: due to
historic rea- son, &quot;horizontal&quot; represents the
&quot;RightOf&quot; and &quot;vertical&quot; represents the
&quot;BelowOf&quot; in acutal TwinView setup.</p>

<p>Option &quot;TVResolution&quot; &quot;res0,res1&quot;
specifies different resolutions for the two screens in
TwinView setup. For example, if the resolution of screen 0
(res0) is 1024x768 and screen 1 (res1) is 1280x1024, the
option will be set to: Option &quot;TVResolution&quot;
&quot;1024x768,1280x1024&quot;</p>

<p>This option is used only when TwinView option is not
none. It is unnecessary to add this option if your screens
are displaying in the same resolutions.</p>

<p>Option &quot;ScreenNo&quot; &quot;n&quot; In a
multi-monitor environment, specifies the screen number in
which the cursor can move.</p>

<p>Option &quot;MMonitor&quot; &quot;n&quot; turns on/off
across monitor movement on a non-TwinView multi-monitor
desktop. The default is &quot;on&quot;. Here n starts from
0, which indicates the first screen.</p>

<p>Option &quot;Rotate&quot;
&quot;CW&quot;|&quot;CCW&quot;|&quot;HALF&quot;|&quot;NONE&quot;
rotates the tablet orientation counterclockwise (CCW) or
clockwise (CW) or 180 degrees (HALF). If you have specific
tablet mappings, i.e. TopX/Y or BottomX/Y were set, the
mapping will be applied before rotation. The default is
&quot;NONE&quot;.</p>

<p>Option &quot;PressCurve&quot; &quot;x1,y1,x2,y2&quot;
sets pressure curve by control points x1, y1, x2, and y2.
Their values are in range from 0..100. The input for linear
curve (default) is &quot;0,0,100,100&quot;; slightly
depressed curve (firmer) might be &quot;5,0,100,95&quot;;
slightly raised curve (softer) might be
&quot;0,5,95,100&quot;. The pressure curve is only
applicable to devices of type stylus or eraser, other
devices do not honor this setting.</p>

<p>Option &quot;KeepShape&quot;
&quot;on&quot;|&quot;off&quot; When this option is enabled,
the active zone begins according to TopX and TopY. The
bottom corner is adjusted to keep the ratio width/height of
the active zone the same as the screen while maximizing the
area described by TopX, TopY, BottomX, BottomY.</p>

<p>Option &quot;DebugLevel&quot; &quot;number&quot; sets
the level of debugging info reported. There are 12 levels,
specified by the integers between 1 and 12. Once it is
defined, all the debug messages with a level less than or
equal to the &quot;number&quot; will be logged into
/etc/X11/Xorg.0.log.</p>

<p>Option &quot;CommonDBG&quot; &quot;number&quot; sets the
level of debugging info for all devices defined for the same
tablet. There are 12 levels in use, specified by the
integers between 1 and 12. Once it is defined, all the debug
messages with a level less than or equal to the
&quot;number&quot; will be logged into
/etc/X11/Xorg.0.log.</p>

<p>Option &quot;CursorProx&quot; &quot;number&quot; sets
the max distance from tablet to stop reporting move- ment
for cursor in relative mode. Default for Intuos series is
10, for Graphire series (including Volitos) is 42.</p>

<p>Option &quot;Serial&quot; &quot;number&quot; sets the
serial number associated with the physical device. This
allows to have multiple devices of the same type (i.e.
multiple pens). This option is only available on wacom V
devices (Intuos series and Cintiq 21U). To see which serial
number belongs to a device, you need to run the utility
program, xsetwacom, which comes with linuxwacom package.</p>

<p>Option &quot;Threshold&quot; &quot;number&quot; sets the
pressure threshold used to generate a button 1 events of
stylus. The default is MaxPressure*3/50.</p>
