<p>NAME setup - A text mode system configuration tool</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS setup</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The setuptool program (setup) is a front-end
menu program for a group of other tools, mostly
system-config-*-tui tools. The list of options which it
presents is assembled by scanning /etc/setuptool.d and
/usr/share/setuptool/setuptool.d for files.</p>

<p>Each file in the directory should contain one or more
lines of text. Each line contains from one to four fields
which are separated by &quot;|&quot; characters. In order,
they are: - the path to the binary to invoke (mandatory) -
the untranslated name of the application which should be
displayed (If unset, defaults to the path of the binary, but
don t depend on that.) - the gettext textdomain in which a
translation of the name of the application can be found (If
unset, defaults to &quot;setup&quot;.) - the directory in
which translations for the textdomain can be found (If
unset, defaults to &quot;/usr/share/locale&quot;.)</p>

<p>If multiple entries with the same untranslated name
exist, the one which was read FIRST takes precedence. Files
are read in name collation order.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE A contrived example would create
/etc/setuptool.d/00bogus with these contents:</p>

<p>/bin/ls --color; /bin/sleep 5|Example &quot;ls&quot;
invocation.</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>/bin/ls --color; /bin/sleep 5|Give this help
list|libc</p>

<p>to use one of libc s (not meaningful here, but)
translatable messages.</p>
