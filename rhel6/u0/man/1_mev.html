<p>MEV(1) MEV(1)</p>

<p>NAME mev - a program to report mouse events</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS mev [ options ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The mev program is part of the gpm package.
The information below is extracted from the texinfo file,
which is the preferred source of information.</p>

<p>The mev program is modeled after xev. It prints to
stdout the mouse console events it gets.</p>

<p>mev s default behaviour is to get anything, but command
line switches can be used to set the various fields in the
Gpm_Connect structure, in order to customize the programs
behaviour. Im using mev to handle mouse events to Emacs.</p>

<p>Command line switches for mev are the following:</p>

<p>-C number Select a virtual console to get events from.
This is intended to be used for debugging.</p>

<p>-d number Choose a default mask. By default the server
gets any events not belonging to the event mask. The mask
can be provided either as a decimal number, or as a symbolic
string.</p>

<p>-e number Choose the event mask. By default any event is
received. The mask can be provided either as a decimal
number, or as a sym- bolic string.</p>

<p>-E Enter emacs mode. In emacs mode events are reported
as lisp forms rather than numbers. This is the format used
by the t- mouse package within emacs.</p>

<p>-f Fit events inside the screen before reporting them.
This options re-fits drag events, which are allowed to exit
the screen bor- der,</p>

<p>-i Interactive. Accepts input from stdin to change
connection parameters.</p>

<p>-m number Choose the minimum modifier mask. Any event
with fewer modifiers will not be reported to mev. It
defaults to 0. The mask must be provided either as a decimal
number, or as a symbolic string.</p>

<p>-M number Choose the maximum modifier mask. Any event
with more modifier than specified will not be reported to
mev. It defaults to ~0, i.e. all events are received. The
mask must be provided either as a decimal number, or as a
symbolic string.</p>

<p>-p Requests to draw the pointer during drags. This
option is used by emacs to avoid invoking ioctl() from lisp
code.</p>

<p>When the arguments are not decimal integers, they are
considered lists of alphanumeric characters, separated by a
single non-alphanumeric character. I use the comma (,), but
any will do.</p>

<p>Allowed names for events are move, drag, down or press,
up or release, motion (which is both move and drag), and
hard.</p>

<p>Allowed names for modifiers are shift, leftAlt,
rightAlt, anyAlt (one or the other), control.</p>

<p>When the -i switch is specified, mev looks at its
standard input as command lines rather than events. The
input lines are parsed, and the commands push and pop are
recognized.</p>

<p>The push command, then, accepts the options -d, -e, -m
and -M, with the same meaning described above. Unspecified
options retain the previous value and the resulting masks
are used to reopen the connection with the server. pop is
used to pop the connection stack. If an empty stack is
popped the program exits.</p>

<p>Other commands recognized are info, used to return the
stack depth; quit to prematurely terminate the program; and
snapshot to get some configuration information from the
server.</p>

<p>BUGS Beginning with release 1.16, mev no longer works
under xterm. Please use the rmev program (provided in the
sample directory) to watch gpm events under xterm or rxvt.
rmev also displays keyboard events besides mouse events.</p>
