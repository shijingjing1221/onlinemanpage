<p>XkbLookupKeyBinding(3) XKB FUNCTIONS
XkbLookupKeyBinding(3)</p>

<p>NAME XkbLookupKeyBinding - Find the string bound to a
key by XRebindKeySym</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS int XkbLookupKeyBinding (Display *dpy, KeySym
sym, unsigned int state, char *buf, int nbytes, int
*extra_rtrn);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS - dpy connection to server</p>

<p>- sym connection to server</p>

<p>- state state for which string is to be looked up</p>

<p>- buf buffer into which returned string is written</p>

<p>- nbytes size of buffer in bytes</p>

<p>- extra_rtrn backfilled with number bytes overflow</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION XkbLookupKeyBinding is the equivalent of the
core XLookupString func- tion.</p>

<p>XRebindKeysym binds an ASCII string to a specified
keysym, so that the string and keysym are returned when the
key is pressed and a specified list of modifiers are also
being held down. XkbLookupKeyBinding returns in buf the
string associated with the keysym sym and modifier state
state. buf is NULL terminated unless theres an overflow. If
the string returned is larger than nbytes, a count of bytes
that does not fit into the buffer is returned in extra_rtrn.
XkbTranslateKeySym returns the number of bytes that it
placed into buf.</p>
