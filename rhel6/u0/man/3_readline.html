<p>READLINE(3) READLINE(3)</p>

<p>NAME readline - get a line from a user with editing</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdio.h&gt; #include
&lt;readline/readline.h&gt; #include
&lt;readline/history.h&gt;</p>

<p>char * readline (const char *prompt);</p>

<p>COPYRIGHT Readline is Copyright (C) 1989-2009 Free
Software Foundation, Inc.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION readline will read a line from the terminal
and return it, using prompt as a prompt. If prompt is NULL
or the empty string, no prompt is issued. The line returned
is allocated with malloc(3); the caller must free it when
finished. The line returned has the final newline removed,
so only the text of the line remains.</p>

<p>readline offers editing capabilities while the user is
entering the line. By default, the line editing commands are
similar to those of emacs. A vi-style line editing interface
is also available.</p>

<p>This manual page describes only the most basic use of
readline. Much more functionality is available; see The GNU
Readline Library and The GNU History Library for additional
information.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE readline returns the text of the line read.
A blank line returns the empty string. If EOF is encountered
while reading a line, and the line is empty, NULL is
returned. If an EOF is read with a non-empty line, it is
treated as a newline.</p>

<p>NOTATION An emacs-style notation is used to denote
keystrokes. Control keys are denoted by C-key, e.g., C-n
means Control-N. Similarly, meta keys are denoted by M-key,
so M-x means Meta-X. (On keyboards without a meta key, M-x
means ESC x, i.e., press the Escape key then the x key. This
makes ESC the meta prefix. The combination M-C-x means
ESC-Control-x, or press the Escape key then hold the Control
key while pressing the x key.)</p>

<p>Readline commands may be given numeric arguments, which
normally act as a repeat count. Sometimes, however, it is
the sign of the argument that is significant. Passing a
negative argument to a command that acts in the forward
direction (e.g., kill-line) causes that command to act in a
backward direction. Commands whose behavior with arguments
deviates from this are noted.</p>

<p>When a command is described as killing text, the text
deleted is saved for possible future retrieval (yanking).
The killed text is saved in a kill ring. Consecutive kills
cause the text to be accumulated into one unit, which can be
yanked all at once. Commands which do not kill text separate
the chunks of text on the kill ring.</p>

<p>INITIALIZATION FILE Readline is customized by putting
commands in an initialization file (the inputrc file). The
name of this file is taken from the value of the INPUTRC
environment variable. If that variable is unset, the default
is ~/.inputrc. If that file does not exist or cannot be
read, the ultimate default is /etc/inputrc. When a program
which uses the readline library starts up, the init file is
read, and the key bindings and variables are set. There are
only a few basic constructs allowed in the readline init
file. Blank lines are ignored. Lines beginning with a # are
comments. Lines beginning with a $ indicate conditional
constructs. Other lines denote key bindings and variable
settings. Each program using this library may add its own
commands and bindings.</p>

<p>For example, placing</p>

<p>M-Control-u: universal-argument or C-Meta-u:
universal-argument</p>

<p>into the inputrc would make M-C-u execute the readline
command univer- sal-argument.</p>

<p>The following symbolic character names are recognized
while processing key bindings: DEL, ESC, ESCAPE, LFD,
NEWLINE, RET, RETURN, RUBOUT, SPACE, SPC, and TAB.</p>

<p>In addition to command names, readline allows keys to be
bound to a string that is inserted when the key is pressed
(a macro).</p>

<p>Key Bindings The syntax for controlling key bindings in
the inputrc file is simple. All that is required is the name
of the command or the text of a macro and a key sequence to
which it should be bound. The name may be speci- fied in one
of two ways: as a symbolic key name, possibly with Meta- or
Control- prefixes, or as a key sequence. The name and key
sequence are separated by a colon. There can be no
whitespace between the name and the colon.</p>

<p>When using the form keyname:function-name or macro,
keyname is the name of a key spelled out in English. For
example:</p>

<p>Control-u: universal-argument Meta-Rubout:
backward-kill-word Control-o: &quot;&gt; output&quot;</p>

<p>In the above example, C-u is bound to the function
universal-argument, M-DEL is bound to the function
backward-kill-word, and C-o is bound to run the macro
expressed on the right hand side (that is, to insert the
text &gt; output into the line).</p>

<p>In the second form, &quot;keyseq&quot;:function-name or
macro, keyseq differs from keyname above in that strings
denoting an entire key sequence may be specified by placing
the sequence within double quotes. Some GNU Emacs style key
escapes can be used, as in the following example, but the
symbolic character names are not recognized.</p>

<p>&quot;universal-argument &quot;read-init-file
&quot;\[11~&quot;: &quot;Function Key 1&quot;</p>

<p>In this example, C-u is again bound to the function
universal-argument. C-x C-r is bound to the function
re-read-init-file, and ESC [ 1 1 ~ is bound to insert the
text Function Key 1.</p>

<p>The full set of GNU Emacs style escape sequences
available when speci- fying key sequences is - control
prefix M- meta prefix e an escape character \ backslash
literal , a single quote</p>

<p>In addition to the GNU Emacs style escape sequences, a
second set of backslash escapes is available: a alert (bell)
b b a c k s p a c e d delete f form feed n newliner carriage
return t horizontal tab vertical tab nnn the eight-bit
character whose value is the octal value nnn (one to three
digits) HH the eight-bit character whose value is the
hexadecimal value HH (one or two hex digits)</p>

<p>When entering the text of a macro, single or double
quotes should be used to indicate a macro definition.
Unquoted text is assumed to be a function name. In the macro
body, the backslash escapes described above are expanded.
Backslash will quote any other character in the macro text,
including &quot; and .</p>

<p>Bash allows the current readline key bindings to be
displayed or modi- fied with the bind builtin command. The
editing mode may be switched during interactive use by using
the -o option to the set builtin com- mand. Other programs
using this library provide similar mechanisms. The inputrc
file may be edited and re-read if a program does not pro-
vide any other means to incorporate new bindings.</p>

<p>Variables Readline has variables that can be used to
further customize its behav- ior. A variable may be set in
the inputrc file with a statement of the form</p>

<p>set variable-name value</p>

<p>Except where noted, readline variables can take the
values On or Off (without regard to case). Unrecognized
variable names are ignored. When a variable value is read,
empty or null values, &quot;on&quot; (case-insen- sitive),
and &quot;1&quot; are equivalent to On. All other values are
equivalent to Off. The variables and their default values
are:</p>

<p>bell-style (audible) Controls what happens when readline
wants to ring the terminal bell. If set to none, readline
never rings the bell. If set to visible, readline uses a
visible bell if one is available. If set to audible,
readline attempts to ring the terminals bell.
bind-tty-special-chars (On) If set to On, readline attempts
to bind the control characters treated specially by the
kernels terminal driver to their read- line equivalents.
comment-begin ) The string that is inserted in vi mode when
the insert-comment command is executed. This command is
bound to M-# in emacs mode and to # in vi command mode.
completion-ignore-case (Off) If set to On, readline performs
filename matching and completion in a case-insensitive
fashion. completion-prefix-display-length (0) The length in
characters of the common prefix of a list of pos- sible
completions that is displayed without modification. When set
to a value greater than zero, common prefixes longer than
this value are replaced with an ellipsis when displaying
possi- ble completions. completion-query-items (100) This
determines when the user is queried about viewing the num-
ber of possible completions generated by the
possible-comple- tions command. It may be set to any integer
value greater than or equal to zero. If the number of
possible completions is greater than or equal to the value
of this variable, the user is asked whether or not he wishes
to view them; otherwise they are simply listed on the
terminal. A negative value causes readline to never ask.
convert-meta (On) If set to On, readline will convert
characters with the eighth bit set to an ASCII key sequence
by stripping the eighth bit and prefixing it with an escape
character (in effect, using escape as the meta prefix).
disable-completion (Off) If set to On, readline will inhibit
word completion. Completion characters will be inserted into
the line as if they had been mapped to self-insert.
editing-mode (emacs) Controls whether readline begins with a
set of key bindings sim- ilar to emacs or vi. editing-mode
can be set to either emacs or vi. enable-keypad (Off) When
set to On, readline will try to enable the application key-
pad when it is called. Some systems need this to enable the
arrow keys. expand-tilde (Off) If set to on, tilde expansion
is performed when readline attempts word completion.
history-preserve-point (Off) If set to on, the history code
attempts to place point at the same location on each history
line retrieved with previous-his- tory or next-history.
history-size (0) Set the maximum number of history entries
saved in the history list. If set to zero, the number of
entries in the history list is not limited.
horizontal-scroll-mode (Off) When set to On, makes readline
use a single line for display, scrolling the input
horizontally on a single screen line when it becomes longer
than the screen width rather than wrapping to a new line.
input-meta (Off) If set to On, readline will enable
eight-bit input (that is, it will not clear the eighth bit
in the characters it reads), regardless of what the terminal
claims it can support. The name meta-flag is a synonym for
this variable. isearch-terminators C-[ C-) The string of
characters that should terminate an incremental search
without subsequently executing the character as a com- mand.
If this variable has not been given a value, the charac-
ters ESC and C-J will terminate an incremental search.
keymap (emacs) Set the current readline keymap. The set of
legal keymap names is emacs, emacs-standard, emacs-meta,
emacs-ctlx, vi, vi-move, vi-command, and vi-insert. vi is
equivalent to vi-command; emacs is equivalent to
emacs-standard. The default value is emacs. The value of
editing-mode also affects the default keymap.
mark-directories (On) If set to On, completed directory
names have a slash appended. mark-modified-lines (Off) If
set to On, history lines that have been modified are dis-
played with a preceding asterisk (*).
mark-symlinked-directories (Off) If set to On, completed
names which are symbolic links to direc- tories have a slash
appended (subject to the value of mark-directories).
match-hidden-files (On) This variable, when set to On,
causes readline to match files whose names begin with a .
(hidden files) when performing filename completion, unless
the leading . is supplied by the user in the filename to be
completed. output-meta (Off) If set to On, readline will
display characters with the eighth bit set directly rather
than as a meta-prefixed escape sequence. page-completions
(On) If set to On, readline uses an internal more-like pager
to dis- play a screenful of possible completions at a time.
print-completions-horizontally (Off) If set to On, readline
will display completions with matches sorted horizontally in
alphabetical order, rather than down the screen.
revert-all-at-newline (Off) If set to on, readline will undo
all changes to history lines before returning when
accept-line is executed. By default, his- tory lines may be
modified and retain individual undo lists across calls to
readline. show-all-if-ambiguous (Off) This alters the
default behavior of the completion functions. If set to on,
words which have more than one possible completion cause the
matches to be listed immediately instead of ringing the
bell. show-all-if-unmodified (Off) This alters the default
behavior of the completion functions in a fashion similar to
show-all-if-ambiguous. If set to on, words which have more
than one possible completion without any possi- ble partial
completion (the possible completions dont share a common
prefix) cause the matches to be listed immediately instead
of ringing the bell. visible-stats (Off) If set to On, a
character denoting a files type as reported by stat(2) is
appended to the filename when listing possible com-
pletions.</p>

<p>Conditional Constructs Readline implements a facility
similar in spirit to the conditional compilation features of
the C preprocessor which allows key bindings and variable
settings to be performed as the result of tests. There are
four parser directives used.</p>

<p>$if The $if construct allows bindings to be made based
on the edit- ing mode, the terminal being used, or the
application using readline. The text of the test extends to
the end of the line; no characters are required to isolate
it.</p>

<p>mode The mode= form of the $if directive is used to test
whether readline is in emacs or vi mode. This may be used in
conjunction with the set keymap command, for instance, to
set bindings in the emacs-standard and emacs-ctlx keymaps
only if readline is starting out in emacs mode.</p>

<p>term The term= form may be used to include
terminal-specific key bindings, perhaps to bind the key
sequences output by the terminal s function keys. The word
on the right side of the = is tested against the full name
of the terminal and the portion of the terminal name before
the first -. This allows sun to match both sun and sun-cmd,
for instance.</p>

<p>application The application construct is used to include
application- specific settings. Each program using the
readline library sets the application name, and an
initialization file can test for a particular value. This
could be used to bind key sequences to functions useful for
a specific program. For instance, the following command adds
a key sequence that quotes the current or previous word in
Bash:</p>

<p>$if Bash # Quote the current or previous word
&quot;&quot;\b $endif</p>

<p>$endif This command, as seen in the previous example,
terminates an $if command.</p>

<p>$else Commands in this branch of the $if directive are
executed if the test fails.</p>

<p>$include This directive takes a single filename as an
argument and reads commands and bindings from that file. For
example, the follow- ing directive would read
/etc/inputrc:</p>

<p>$include /etc/inputrc</p>

<p>SEARCHING Readline provides commands for searching
through the command history for lines containing a specified
string. There are two search modes: incremental and
non-incremental.</p>

<p>Incremental searches begin before the user has finished
typing the search string. As each character of the search
string is typed, read- line displays the next entry from the
history matching the string typed so far. An incremental
search requires only as many characters as needed to find
the desired history entry. To search backward in the history
for a particular string, type C-r. Typing C-s searches
forward through the history. The characters present in the
value of the isearch-terminators variable are used to
terminate an incremental search. If that variable has not
been assigned a value the Escape and C-J characters will
terminate an incremental search. C-G will abort an
incremental search and restore the original line. When the
search is terminated, the history entry containing the
search string becomes the current line.</p>

<p>To find other matching entries in the history list, type
C-s or C-r as appropriate. This will search backward or
forward in the history for the next line matching the search
string typed so far. Any other key sequence bound to a
readline command will terminate the search and exe- cute
that command. For instance, a newline will terminate the
search and accept the line, thereby executing the command
from the history list. A movement command will terminate the
search, make the last line found the current line, and begin
editing.</p>

<p>Non-incremental searches read the entire search string
before starting to search for matching history lines. The
search string may be typed by the user or be part of the
contents of the current line.</p>

<p>EDITING COMMANDS The following is a list of the names of
the commands and the default key sequences to which they are
bound. Command names without an accom- panying key sequence
are unbound by default.</p>

<p>In the following descriptions, point refers to the
current cursor posi- tion, and mark refers to a cursor
position saved by the set-mark com- mand. The text between
the point and mark is referred to as the region.</p>

<p>Commands for Moving beginning-of-line (C-a) Move to the
start of the current line. end-of-line (C-e) Move to the end
of the line. forward-char (C-f) Move forward a character.
backward-char (C-b) Move back a character. forward-word
(M-f) Move forward to the end of the next word. Words are
composed of alphanumeric characters (letters and digits).
backward-word (M-b) Move back to the start of the current or
previous word. Words are composed of alphanumeric characters
(letters and digits). clear-screen (C-l) Clear the screen
leaving the current line at the top of the screen. With an
argument, refresh the current line without clearing the
screen. redraw-current-line Refresh the current line.</p>

<p>Commands for Manipulating the History accept-line
(Newline, Return) Accept the line regardless of where the
cursor is. If this line is non-empty, it may be added to the
history list for future recall with add_history(). If the
line is a modified history line, the history line is
restored to its original state. previous-history (C-p) Fetch
the previous command from the history list, moving back in
the list. next-history (C-n) Fetch the next command from the
history list, moving forward in the list.
beginning-of-history (M-&lt;) Move to the first line in the
history. end-of-history (M-&gt;) Move to the end of the
input history, i.e., the line currently being entered.
reverse-search-history (C-r) Search backward starting at the
current line and moving up through the history as necessary.
This is an incremental search. forward-search-history (C-s)
Search forward starting at the current line and moving down
through the history as necessary. This is an incremental
search. non-incremental-reverse-search-history (M-p) Search
backward through the history starting at the current line
using a non-incremental search for a string supplied by the
user. non-incremental-forward-search-history (M-n) Search
forward through the history using a non-incremental search
for a string supplied by the user. history-search-forward
Search forward through the history for the string of
characters between the start of the current line and the
current cursor position (the point). This is a
non-incremental search. history-search-backward Search
backward through the history for the string of characters
between the start of the current line and the point. This is
a non-incremental search. yank-nth-arg (M-C-y) Insert the
first argument to the previous command (usually the second
word on the previous line) at point. With an argument n,
insert the nth word from the previous command (the words in
the previous command begin with word 0). A negative argument
inserts the nth word from the end of the previous command.
Once the argument n is computed, the argument is extracted
as if the &quot;!n&quot; history expansion had been
specified. yank-last-arg (M-., M-_) Insert the last argument
to the previous command (the last word of the previous
history entry). With an argument, behave exactly like
yank-nth-arg. Successive calls to yank-last-arg move back
through the history list, inserting the last argument of
each line in turn. The history expansion facilities are used
to extract the last argument, as if the &quot;!$&quot;
history expansion had been specified.</p>

<p>Commands for Changing Text delete-char (C-d) Delete the
character at point. If point is at the beginning of the
line, there are no characters in the line, and the last
character typed was not bound to delete-char, then return
EOF. backward-delete-char (Rubout) Delete the character
behind the cursor. When given a numeric argument, save the
deleted text on the kill ring. forward-backward-delete-char
Delete the character under the cursor, unless the cursor is
at the end of the line, in which case the character behind
the cur- sor is deleted. quoted-insert (C-q, C-v) Add the
next character that you type to the line verbatim. This is
how to insert characters like C-q, for example. tab-insert
(M-TAB) Insert a tab character. self-insert (a, b, A, 1, !,
...) Insert the character typed. transpose-chars (C-t) Drag
the character before point forward over the character at
point, moving point forward as well. If point is at the end
of the line, then this transposes the two characters before
point. Negative arguments have no effect. transpose-words
(M-t) Drag the word before point past the word after point,
moving point over that word as well. If point is at the end
of the line, this transposes the last two words on the line.
upcase-word (M-u) Uppercase the current (or following) word.
With a negative argument, uppercase the previous word, but
do not move point. downcase-word (M-l) Lowercase the current
(or following) word. With a negative argument, lowercase the
previous word, but do not move point. capitalize-word (M-c)
Capitalize the current (or following) word. With a negative
argument, capitalize the previous word, but do not move
point. overwrite-mode Toggle overwrite mode. With an
explicit positive numeric argu- ment, switches to overwrite
mode. With an explicit non-positive numeric argument,
switches to insert mode. This command affects only emacs
mode; vi mode does overwrite differently. Each call to
readline() starts in insert mode. In overwrite mode, charac-
ters bound to self-insert replace the text at point rather
than pushing the text to the right. Characters bound to
back- ward-delete-char replace the character before point
with a space. By default, this command is unbound.</p>

<p>Killing and Yanking kill-line (C-k) Kill the text from
point to the end of the line. backward-kill-line (C-x
Rubout) Kill backward to the beginning of the line.
unix-line-discard (C-u) Kill backward from point to the
beginning of the line. The killed text is saved on the
kill-ring. kill-whole-line Kill all characters on the
current line, no matter where point is. kill-word (M-d) Kill
from point the end of the current word, or if between words,
to the end of the next word. Word boundaries are the same as
those used by forward-word. backward-kill-word (M-Rubout)
Kill the word behind point. Word boundaries are the same as
those used by backward-word. unix-word-rubout (C-w) Kill the
word behind point, using white space as a word bound- ary.
The killed text is saved on the kill-ring.
unix-filename-rubout Kill the word behind point, using white
space and the slash character as the word boundaries. The
killed text is saved on the kill-ring.
delete-horizontal-space (M) Delete all spaces and tabs
around point. kill-region Kill the text between the point
and mark (saved cursor posi- tion). This text is referred to
as the region. copy-region-as-kill Copy the text in the
region to the kill buffer. copy-backward-word Copy the word
before point to the kill buffer. The word bound- aries are
the same as backward-word. copy-forward-word Copy the word
following point to the kill buffer. The word boundaries are
the same as forward-word. yank (C-y) Yank the top of the
kill ring into the buffer at point. yank-pop (M-y) Rotate
the kill ring, and yank the new top. Only works follow- ing
yank or yank-pop.</p>

<p>Numeric Arguments digit-argument (M-0, M-1, ..., M--)
Add this digit to the argument already accumulating, or
start a new argument. M-- starts a negative argument.
universal-argument This is another way to specify an
argument. If this command is followed by one or more digits,
optionally with a leading minus sign, those digits define
the argument. If the command is fol- lowed by digits,
executing universal-argument again ends the numeric
argument, but is otherwise ignored. As a special case, if
this command is immediately followed by a character that is
neither a digit or minus sign, the argument count for the
next command is multiplied by four. The argument count is
initially one, so executing this function the first time
makes the argu- ment count four, a second time makes the
argument count sixteen, and so on.</p>

<p>Completing complete (TAB) Attempt to perform completion
on the text before point. The actual completion performed is
application-specific. Bash, for instance, attempts
completion treating the text as a variable (if the text
begins with $), username (if the text begins with ~),
hostname (if the text begins with @), or command (including
aliases and functions) in turn. If none of these produces a
match, filename completion is attempted. Gdb, on the other
hand, allows completion of program functions and variables,
and only attempts filename completion under certain
circumstances. possible-completions (M-?) List the possible
completions of the text before point. insert-completions
(M-*) Insert all completions of the text before point that
would have been generated by possible-completions.
menu-complete Similar to complete, but replaces the word to
be completed with a single match from the list of possible
completions. Repeated execution of menu-complete steps
through the list of possible completions, inserting each
match in turn. At the end of the list of completions, the
bell is rung (subject to the setting of bell-style) and the
original text is restored. An argument of n moves n
positions forward in the list of matches; a negative
argument may be used to move backward through the list. This
command is intended to be bound to TAB, but is unbound by
default. delete-char-or-list Deletes the character under the
cursor if not at the beginning or end of the line (like
delete-char). If at the end of the line, behaves identically
to possible-completions.</p>

<p>Keyboard Macros start-kbd-macro (C-x () Begin saving the
characters typed into the current keyboard macro.
end-kbd-macro (C-x )) Stop saving the characters typed into
the current keyboard macro and store the definition.
call-last-kbd-macro (C-x e) Re-execute the last keyboard
macro defined, by making the char- acters in the macro
appear as if typed at the keyboard.</p>

<p>Miscellaneous re-read-init-file (C-x C-r) Read in the
contents of the inputrc file, and incorporate any bindings
or variable assignments found there. abort (C-g) Abort the
current editing command and ring the terminals bell (subject
to the setting of bell-style). do-uppercase-version (M-a,
M-b, M-x, ...) If the metafied character x is lowercase, run
the command that is bound to the corresponding uppercase
character. prefix-meta (ESC) Metafy the next character
typed. ESC f is equivalent to Meta-f. undo (C-_, C-x C-u)
Incremental undo, separately remembered for each line.
revert-line (M-r) Undo all changes made to this line. This
is like executing the undo command enough times to return
the line to its initial state. tilde-expand (M-&amp;)
Perform tilde expansion on the current word. set-mark (C-@,
M-&lt;space&gt;) Set the mark to the point. If a numeric
argument is supplied, the mark is set to that position.
exchange-point-and-mark (C-x C-x) Swap the point with the
mark. The current cursor position is set to the saved
position, and the old cursor position is saved as the mark.
character-search (C-]) A character is read and point is
moved to the next occurrence of that character. A negative
count searches for previous occur- rences.
character-search-backward (M-C-]) A character is read and
point is moved to the previous occur- rence of that
character. A negative count searches for subse- quent
occurrences. insert-comment (M-#) Without a numeric
argument, the value of the readline com- ment-begin variable
is inserted at the beginning of the current line. If a
numeric argument is supplied, this command acts as a toggle:
if the characters at the beginning of the line do not match
the value of comment-begin, the value is inserted, other-
wise the characters in comment-begin are deleted from the
begin- ning of the line. In either case, the line is
accepted as if a newline had been typed. The default value
of comment-begin makes the current line a shell comment. If
a numeric argument causes the comment character to be
removed, the line will be executed by the shell.
dump-functions Print all of the functions and their key
bindings to the read- line output stream. If a numeric
argument is supplied, the out- put is formatted in such a
way that it can be made part of an inputrc file.
dump-variables Print all of the settable variables and their
values to the readline output stream. If a numeric argument
is supplied, the output is formatted in such a way that it
can be made part of an inputrc file. dump-macros Print all
of the readline key sequences bound to macros and the
strings they output. If a numeric argument is supplied, the
output is formatted in such a way that it can be made part
of an inputrc file. emacs-editing-mode (C-e) When in vi
command mode, this causes a switch to emacs editing mode.
vi-editing-mode (M-C-j) When in emacs editing mode, this
causes a switch to vi editing mode.</p>

<p>DEFAULT KEY BINDINGS The following is a list of the
default emacs and vi bindings. Charac- ters with the eighth
bit set are written as M-&lt;character&gt;, and are referred
to as metafied characters. The printable ASCII characters
not mentioned in the list of emacs standard bindings are
bound to the self-insert function, which just inserts the
given character into the input line. In vi insertion mode,
all characters not specifically men- tioned are bound to
self-insert. Characters assigned to signal genera- tion by
stty(1) or the terminal driver, such as C-Z or C-C, retain
that function. Upper and lower case metafied characters are
bound to the same function in the emacs mode meta keymap.
The remaining characters are unbound, which causes readline
to ring the bell (subject to the setting of the bell-style
variable).</p>
