<p>NAME jps - Java Virtual Machine Process Status Tool</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS jps [ options ] [ hostid ]</p>

<p>PARAMETERS options Command-line options.</p>

<p>hostid The host identifier of the host for which the
process report should be generated. The hostid may include
optional components that indi- cate the communications
protocol, port number, and other implementa- tion specific
data.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The jps tool lists the instrumented HotSpot
Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) on the target system. The tool
is limited to reporting informa- tion on JVMs for which it
has the access permissions.</p>

<p>If jps is run without specifying a hostid, it will look
for instru- mented JVMs on the local host. If started with a
hostid, it will look for JVMs on the indicated host, using
the specified protocol and port. A jstatd process is assumed
to be running on the target host.</p>

<p>The jps command will report the local VM identifier, or
lvmid, for each instrumented JVM found on the target system.
The lvmid is typically, but not necessarily, the operating
system s process identifier for the JVM process. With no
options, jps will list each Java applications lvmid followed
by the short form of the applications class name or jar file
name. The short form of the class name or JAR file name
omits the class s package information or the JAR files path
information.</p>

<p>The jps command uses the java launcher to find the class
name and argu- ments passed to the main method. If the
target JVM is started with a custom launcher, the class name
(or JAR file name) and the arguments to the main method will
not be available. In this case, the jps command will output
the string Unknown for the class name or JAR file name and
for the arguments to the main method.</p>

<p>The list of JVMs produced by the jps command may be
limited by the per- missions granted to the principal
running the command. The command will only list the JVMs for
which the principle has access rights as deter- mined by
operating system specific access control mechanisms.</p>

<p>NOTE: This utility is unsupported and may not be
available in future versions of the JDK. It is not currently
available on Windows 98 and Windows ME platforms.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The jps command supports a number of options
that modify the output of the command. These options are
subject to change or removal in the future.</p>

<p>-q Suppress the output of the class name, JAR file name,
and arguments passed to the main method, producing only a
list of local VM identi- fiers.</p>

<p>-m Output the arguments passed to the main method. The
output may be null for embedded JVMs.</p>

<p>-l Output the full package name for the applications
main class or the full path name to the applications JAR
file.</p>

<p>-v Output the arguments passed to the JVM.</p>

<p>-V Output the arguments passed to the JVM through the
flags file (the .hotspotrc file or the file specified by the
-XX:Flags=&lt;filename&gt; argument).</p>

<p>-Joption Pass option to the java launcher called by jps.
For example, -J-Xms48m sets the startup memory to 48
megabytes. It is a common convention for -J to pass options
to the underlying VM executing applications written in
Java.</p>

<p>HOST IDENTIFIER The host identifier, or hostid is a
string that indicates the target system. The syntax of the
hostid string largely corresponds to the syntax of a
URI:</p>

<p>[protocol:][[//]hostname][:port][/servername]</p>

<p>protocol The communications protocol. If the protocol is
omitted and a hostname is not specified, the default
protocol is a platform specific, optimized, local protocol.
If the protocol is omitted and a hostname is specified, then
the default protocol is rmi.</p>

<p>hostname A hostname or IP address indicating the target
host. If hostname is omitted, then the target host is the
local host.</p>

<p>port The default port for communicating with the remote
server. If the hostname is omitted or the protocol specifies
an optimized, local protocol, then port is ignored.
Otherwise, treatment of the port parameter is implementation
specific. For the default rmi proto- col the port indicates
the port number for the rmiregistry on the remote host. If
port is omitted, and protocol indicates rmi, then the
default rmiregistry port (1099) is used.</p>

<p>servername The treatment of this parameter depends on
the implementation. For the optimized, local protocol, this
field is ignored. For the rmi protocol, this parameter is a
string representing the name of the RMI remote object on the
remote host. See the -n option for the jstatd command.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FORMAT The output of the jps command follows the
following pattern:</p>

<p>lvmid [ [ classname | JARfilename | &quot;Unknown&quot;]
[ arg* ] [ jvmarg* ] ]</p>

<p>Where all output tokens are separated by white space. An
arg that includes embedded white space will introduce
ambiguity when attempting to map arguments to their actual
positional parameters. NOTE: You are advised not to write
scripts to parse jps output since the format may change in
future releases. If you choose to write scripts that parse
jps output, expect to modify them for future releases of
this tool.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES This section provides examples of the jps
command.</p>

<p>Listing the instrumented JVMs on the local host:</p>

<p>jps</p>

<p>18027 Java2Demo.JAR</p>

<p>18032 jps</p>

<p>18005 jstat</p>

<p>Listing the instrumented JVMs on a remote host:</p>

<p>This example assumes that the jstat server and either
the its internal RMI registry or a separate external
rmiregistry process are running on the remote host on the
default port (port 1099). It also assumes that the local
host has appropriate permissions to access the remote host.
This example also includes the -l option to output the long
form of the class names or JAR file names.</p>

<p>jps -l remote.domain</p>

<p>3002 /opt/j2sdk1.5.0/demo/jfc/Java2D/Java2Demo.JAR</p>

<p>2857 sun.tools.jstatd.jstatd</p>

<p>Listing the instrumented JVMs on a remote host with a
non-default port for the RMI registry</p>

<p>This example assumes that the jstatd server, with an
internal RMI reg- istry bound to port 2002, is running on
the remote host. This example also uses the -m option to
include the arguments passed to the main method of each of
the listed Java applications.</p>

<p>jps -m remote.domain:2002</p>

<p>3002 /opt/j2sdk1.5.0/demo/jfc/Java2D/Java2Demo.JAR</p>

<p>3102 sun.tools.jstatd.jstatd -p 2002</p>
