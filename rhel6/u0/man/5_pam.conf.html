<p>PAM.CONF(5) Linux-PAM Manual PAM.CONF(5)</p>

<p>NAME pam.conf, pam.d - PAM configuration files</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION When a PAM aware privilege granting
application is started, it activates its attachment to the
PAM-API. This activation performs a number of tasks, the
most important being the reading of the configuration
file(s): /etc/pam.conf. Alternatively, this may be the
contents of the /etc/pam.d/ directory. The presence of this
directory will cause Linux-PAM to ignore /etc/pam.conf.</p>

<p>These files list the PAMs that will do the
authentication tasks required by this service, and the
appropriate behavior of the PAM-API in the event that
individual PAMs fail.</p>

<p>The syntax of the /etc/pam.conf configuration file is as
follows. The file is made up of a list of rules, each rule
is typically placed on a single line, but may be extended
with an escaped end of line: &lt;LF&gt;&acute;. Comments are
preceded with #&acute; marks and extend to the next end of
line.</p>

<p>The format of each rule is a space separated collection
of tokens, the first three being case-insensitive:</p>

<p>service type control module-path module-arguments</p>

<p>The syntax of files contained in the /etc/pam.d/
directory, are identical except for the absence of any
service field. In this case, the service is the name of the
file in the /etc/pam.d/ directory. This filename must be in
lower case.</p>

<p>An important feature of PAM, is that a number of rules
may be stacked to combine the services of a number of PAMs
for a given authentication task.</p>

<p>The service is typically the familiar name of the
corresponding application: login and su are good examples.
The service-name, other, is reserved for giving default
rules. Only lines that mention the current service (or in
the absence of such, the other entries) will be associated
with the given service-application.</p>

<p>The type is the management group that the rule
corresponds to. It is used to specify which of the
management groups the subsequent module is to be associated
with. Valid entries are:</p>

<p>account this module type performs non-authentication
based account management. It is typically used to
restrict/permit access to a service based on the time of
day, currently available system resources (maximum number of
users) or perhaps the location of the applicant user --
&acute;root&acute; login only on the console.</p>

<p>auth this module type provides two aspects of
authenticating the user. Firstly, it establishes that the
user is who they claim to be, by instructing the application
to prompt the user for a password or other means of
identification. Secondly, the module can grant group
membership or other privileges through its credential
granting properties.</p>

<p>password this module type is required for updating the
authentication token associated with the user. Typically,
there is one module for each
&acute;challenge/response&acute; based authentication (auth)
type.</p>

<p>session this module type is associated with doing things
that need to be done for the user before/after they can be
given service. Such things include the logging of
information concerning the opening/closing of some data
exchange with a user, mounting directories, etc.</p>

<p>If the type value from the list above is prepended with
a - character the PAM library will not log to the system log
if it is not possible to load the module because it is
missing in the system. This can be useful especially for
modules which are not always installed on the system and are
not required for correct authentication and authorization of
the login session.</p>

<p>The third field, control, indicates the behavior of the
PAM-API should the module fail to succeed in its
authentication task. There are two types of syntax for this
control field: the simple one has a single simple keyword;
the more complicated one involves a square-bracketed
selection of value=action pairs.</p>

<p>For the simple (historical) syntax valid control values
are:</p>

<p>required failure of such a PAM will ultimately lead to
the PAM-API returning failure but only after the remaining
stacked modules (for this service and type) have been
invoked.</p>

<p>requisite like required, however, in the case that such
a module returns a failure, control is directly returned to
the application. The return value is that associated with
the first required or requisite module to fail. Note, this
flag can be used to protect against the possibility of a
user getting the opportunity to enter a password over an
unsafe medium. It is conceivable that such behavior might
inform an attacker of valid accounts on a system. This
possibility should be weighed against the not insignificant
concerns of exposing a sensitive password in a hostile
environment.</p>

<p>sufficient success of such a module is enough to satisfy
the authentication requirements of the stack of modules (if
a prior required module has failed the success of this one
is ignored). A failure of this module is not deemed as fatal
to satisfying the application that this type has succeeded.
If the module succeeds the PAM framework returns success to
the application immediately without trying any other
modules.</p>

<p>optional the success or failure of this module is only
important if it is the only module in the stack associated
with this service+type.</p>

<p>include include all lines of given type from the
configuration file specified as an argument to this
control.</p>

<p>substack include all lines of given type from the
configuration file specified as an argument to this control.
This differs from include in that evaluation of the done and
die actions in a substack does not cause skipping the rest
of the complete module stack, but only of the substack.
Jumps in a substack also can not make evaluation jump out of
it, and the whole substack is counted as one module when the
jump is done in a parent stack. The reset action will reset
the state of a module stack to the state it was in as of
beginning of the substack evaluation.</p>

<p>For the more complicated syntax valid control values
have the following form:</p>

<p>[value1=action1 value2=action2 ...]</p>

<p>Where valueN corresponds to the return code from the
function invoked in the module for which the line is
defined. It is selected from one of these: success,
open_err, symbol_err, service_err, system_err, buf_err,
perm_denied, auth_err, cred_insufficient, authinfo_unavail,
user_unknown, maxtries, new_authtok_reqd, acct_expired,
session_err, cred_unavail, cred_expired, cred_err,
no_module_data, conv_err, authtok_err, authtok_recover_err,
authtok_lock_busy, authtok_disable_aging, try_again, ignore,
abort, authtok_expired, module_unknown, bad_item,
conv_again, incomplete, and default.</p>

<p>The last of these, default, implies &acute;all
valueN&acute;s not mentioned explicitly. Note, the full list
of PAM errors is available in
/usr/include/security/_pam_types.h. The actionN can be: an
unsigned integer, n, signifying an action of &acute;jump
over the next n modules in the stack&acute;; or take one of
the following forms:</p>

<p>ignore when used with a stack of modules, the
module&acute;s return status will not contribute to the
return code the application obtains.</p>

<p>bad this action indicates that the return code should be
thought of as indicative of the module failing. If this
module is the first in the stack to fail, its status value
will be used for that of the whole stack.</p>

<p>die equivalent to bad with the side effect of
terminating the module stack and PAM immediately returning
to the application.</p>

<p>ok this tells PAM that the administrator thinks this
return code should contribute directly to the return code of
the full stack of modules. In other words, if the former
state of the stack would lead to a return of PAM_SUCCESS,
the module&acute;s return code will override this value.
Note, if the former state of the stack holds some value that
is indicative of a modules failure, this &acute;ok&acute;
value will not be used to override that value.</p>

<p>done equivalent to ok with the side effect of
terminating the module stack and PAM immediately returning
to the application.</p>

<p>reset clear all memory of the state of the module stack
and start again with the next stacked module.</p>

<p>Each of the four keywords: required; requisite;
sufficient; and optional, have an equivalent expression in
terms of the [...] syntax. They are as follows:</p>

<p>required [success=ok new_authtok_reqd=ok ignore=ignore
default=bad]</p>

<p>requisite [success=ok new_authtok_reqd=ok ignore=ignore
default=die]</p>

<p>sufficient [success=done new_authtok_reqd=done
default=ignore]</p>

<p>optional [success=ok new_authtok_reqd=ok
default=ignore]</p>

<p>module-path is either the full filename of the PAM to be
used by the application (it begins with a &acute;/&acute;),
or a relative pathname from the default module location:
/lib/security/ or /lib64/security/, depending on the
architecture.</p>

<p>module-arguments are a space separated list of tokens
that can be used to modify the specific behavior of the
given PAM. Such arguments will be documented for each
individual module. Note, if you wish to include spaces in an
argument, you should surround that argument with square
brackets.</p>

<p>squid auth required pam_mysql.so user=passwd_query
passwd=mada db=eminence [query=select user_name from
internet_service where user_name=&acute;%u&acute; and
password=PASSWORD(&acute;%p&acute;) and
service=&acute;web_proxy&acute;]</p>

<p>When using this convention, you can include [&acute;
characters inside the string, and if you wish to include a
]&acute; character inside the string that will survive the
argument parsing, you should use ]&acute;. In other
words:</p>

<p>[..[..]..] --&gt; ..[..]..</p>

<p>Any line in (one of) the configuration file(s), that is
not formatted correctly, will generally tend (erring on the
side of caution) to make the authentication process fail. A
corresponding error is written to the system log files with
a call to syslog(3).</p>

<p>More flexible than the single configuration file is it
to configure libpam via the contents of the /etc/pam.d/
directory. In this case the directory is filled with files
each of which has a filename equal to a service-name (in
lower-case): it is the personal configuration file for the
named service.</p>

<p>The syntax of each file in /etc/pam.d/ is similar to
that of the /etc/pam.conf file and is made up of lines of
the following form:</p>

<p>type control module-path module-arguments</p>

<p>The only difference being that the service-name is not
present. The service-name is of course the name of the given
configuration file. For example, /etc/pam.d/login contains
the configuration for the login service.</p>
