<p>NAME rcsfile - format of RCS file</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION An RCS files contents are described by the
grammar below.</p>

<p>The text is free format: space, backspace, tab, newline,
vertical tab, form feed, and carriage return (collectively,
white space) have no sig- nificance except in strings.
However, white space cannot appear within an id, num, or
sym, and an RCS file must end with a newline.</p>

<p>Strings are enclosed by @. If a string contains a @, it
must be dou- bled; otherwise, strings can contain arbitrary
binary data.</p>

<p>The meta syntax uses the following conventions: | (bar)
separates alternatives; { and } enclose optional phrases; {
and }* enclose phrases that can be repeated zero or more
times; { and }+ enclose phrases that must appear at least
once and can be repeated; Terminal symbols are in boldface;
nonterminal symbols are in italics.</p>

<p>rcstext ::= admin {delta}* desc {deltatext}*</p>

<p>admin ::= head {num}; { branch {num}; } access {id}*;
symbols {sym : num}*; locks {id : num}*; {strict ;} {
comment {string}; } { expand {string}; } { newphrase }*</p>

<p>delta ::= num date num; author id; state {id}; branches
{num}*; next {num}; { newphrase }*</p>

<p>desc ::= desc string</p>

<p>deltatext ::= num log string { newphrase }* text
string</p>

<p>num ::= {digit | .}+</p>

<p>digit ::= 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9</p>

<p>id ::= {num} idchar {idchar | num}*</p>

<p>sym ::= {digit}* idchar {idchar | digit}*</p>

<p>idchar ::= any visible graphic character except
special</p>

<p>special ::= $ | , | . | : | ; | @</p>

<p>string ::= @{any character, with @ doubled}*@</p>

<p>newphrase ::= id word* ;</p>

<p>word ::= id | num | string | :</p>

<p>Identifiers are case sensitive. Keywords are in lower
case only. The sets of keywords and identifiers can overlap.
In most environments RCS uses the ISO 8859/1 encoding:
visible graphic characters are codes 041-176 and 240-377,
and white space characters are codes 010-015 and 040.</p>

<p>Dates, which appear after the date keyword, are of the
form Y.mm.dd.hh.mm.ss, where Y is the year, mm the month
(01-12), dd the day (01-31), hh the hour (00-23), mm the
minute (00-59), and ss the second (00-60). Y contains just
the last two digits of the year for years from 1900 through
1999, and all the digits of years thereafter. Dates use the
Gregorian calendar; times use UTC.</p>

<p>The newphrase productions in the grammar are reserved
for future exten- sions to the format of RCS files. No
newphrase will begin with any keyword already in use.</p>

<p>The delta nodes form a tree. All nodes whose numbers
consist of a sin- gle pair (e.g., 2.3, 2.1, 1.3, etc.) are
on the trunk, and are linked through the next field in order
of decreasing numbers. The head field in the admin node
points to the head of that sequence (i.e., contains the
highest pair). The branch node in the admin node indicates
the default branch (or revision) for most RCS operations. If
empty, the default branch is the highest branch on the
trunk.</p>

<p>All delta nodes whose numbers consist of 2n fields (n2)
(e.g., 3.1.1.1, 2.1.2.2, etc.) are linked as follows. All
nodes whose first 2n-1 number fields are identical are
linked through the next field in order of increasing
numbers. For each such sequence, the delta node whose number
is identical to the first 2n-2 number fields of the deltas
on that sequence is called the branchpoint. The branches
field of a node contains a list of the numbers of the first
nodes of all sequences for which it is a branchpoint. This
list is ordered in increasing num- bers.</p>

<p>The following diagram shows an example of an RCS file s
organization.</p>
