<p>NAME pamoil - turn a PAM image into an oil painting</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pamoil</p>

<p>[-n N]</p>

<p>[pamfile]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pamoil reads a Netpbm image as input and does an oil
transfer, and writes the same type of Netpbm image as
output.</p>

<p>The oil transfer is described in Beyond Photography by
Holzmann, chapter 4, photo 7. Its a sort of localized
smearing.</p>

<p>The smearing works like this: First, assume a grayscale
image. For each pixel in the image, pamoil looks at a square
neighborhood around it. pamoil determines what is the most
common pixel intensity in the neighborhood, and puts a pixel
of that intensity into the output in the same position as
the input pixel.</p>

<p>For color images, or any arbitrary multi-channel image,
pamoil computes each channel (e.g. red, green, and blue)
separately the same way as the grayscale case above.</p>

<p>At the edges of the image, where the regular
neighborhood would run off the edge of the image, pamoil
uses a clipped neighborhood.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -n size This is the size of the neighborhood
used in the smearing. The neighborhood is this many pixels
in all four directions.</p>

<p>The default is 3.</p>
