<p>NAME iceauth - ICE authority file utility</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The iceauth program is used to edit and

authorization records from one machine and merge them in on
another (as is the case when using remote logins or granting
access to other users). Commands (described below) may be
entered interactively, on the iceauth command line, or in
scripts.</p>
