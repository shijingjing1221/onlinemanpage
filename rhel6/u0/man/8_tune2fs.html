<p>TUNE2FS(8) TUNE2FS(8)</p>

<p>NAME tune2fs - adjust tunable filesystem parameters on
ext2/ext3/ext4 filesystems</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS tune2fs [ -l ] [ -c max-mount-counts ] [ -e
errors-behavior ] [ -f ] [ -i interval-between-checks ] [ -j
] [ -J journal-options ] [ -m reserved-blocks-percentage ] [
-o [^]mount-options[,...] ] [ -r reserved-blocks-count ] [
-s sparse-super-flag ] [ -u user ] [ -g group ] [ -C
mount-count ] [ -E extended-options ] [ -L volume-name ] [
-M last-mounted-directory ] [ -O [^]feature[,...] ] [ -T
time-last- checked ] [ -U UUID ] device</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION tune2fs allows the system administrator to
adjust various tunable filesystem parameters on Linux ext2,
ext3, or ext4 filesystems. The current values of these
options can be displayed by using the -l option to
tune2fs(8) program, or by using the dumpe2fs(8) program.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -c max-mount-counts Adjust the number of mounts
after which the filesystem will be checked by e2fsck(8). If
max-mount-counts is 0 or -1, the num- ber of times the
filesystem is mounted will be disregarded by e2fsck(8) and
the kernel.</p>

<p>Staggering the mount-counts at which filesystems are
forcibly checked will avoid all filesystems being checked at
one time when using journaled filesystems.</p>

<p>You should strongly consider the consequences of
disabling mount-count-dependent checking entirely. Bad disk
drives, cables, memory, and kernel bugs could all corrupt a
filesystem without marking the filesystem dirty or in error.
If you are using journaling on your filesystem, your
filesystem will never be marked dirty, so it will not
normally be checked. A filesys- tem error detected by the
kernel will still force an fsck on the next reboot, but it
may already be too late to prevent data loss at that
point.</p>

<p>See also the -i option for time-dependent checking.</p>

<p>-C mount-count Set the number of times the filesystem
has been mounted. If set to a greater value than the
max-mount-counts parameter set by the -c option, e2fsck(8)
will check the filesystem at the next reboot.</p>

<p>-e error-behavior Change the behavior of the kernel code
when errors are detected. In all cases, a filesystem error
will cause e2fsck(8) to check the filesystem on the next
boot. error-behavior can be one of the following:</p>

<p>continue Continue normal execution.</p>

<p>remount-ro Remount filesystem read-only.</p>

<p>panic Cause a kernel panic.</p>

<p>-E extended-options Set extended options for the
filesystem. Extended options are comma separated, and may
take an argument using the equals (=) sign. The following
extended options are supported:</p>

<p>stride=stride-size Configure the filesystem for a RAID
array with stride-size filesystem blocks. This is the number
of blocks read or written to disk before moving to next
disk. This mostly affects placement of filesystem metadata
like bitmaps at mke2fs(2) time to avoid placing them on a
single disk, which can hurt the performance. It may also be
used by block alloca- tor.</p>

<p>stripe_width=stripe-width Configure the filesystem for a
RAID array with stripe-width filesystem blocks per stripe.
This is typically be stride-size * N, where N is the number
of data disks in the RAID (e.g. RAID 5 N+1, RAID 6 N+2).
This allows the block allocator to prevent read-modify-write
of the parity in a RAID stripe if possible when the data is
written.</p>

<p>hash_alg=hash-alg Set the default hash algorithm used
for filesystems with hashed b-tree directories. Valid
algorithms accepted are: legacy, half_md4, and tea.</p>

<p>test_fs Set a flag in the filesystem superblock
indicating that it may be mounted using experimental kernel
code, such as the ext4dev filesystem.</p>

<p>^test_fs Clear the test_fs flag, indicating the
filesystem should only be mounted using production-level
filesystem code.</p>

<p>-f Force the tune2fs operation to complete even in the
face of errors. This option is useful when removing the
has_journal filesystem feature from a filesystem which has
an external jour- nal (or is corrupted such that it appears
to have an external journal), but that external journal is
not available.</p>

<p>WARNING: Removing an external journal from a filesystem
which was not cleanly unmounted without first replaying the
external journal can result in severe data loss and
filesystem corrup- tion.</p>

<p>-g group Set the group which can use the reserved
filesystem blocks. The group parameter can be a numerical
gid or a group name. If a group name is given, it is
converted to a numerical gid before it is stored in the
superblock.</p>

<p>-i interval-between-checks[d|m|w] Adjust the maximal
time between two filesystem checks. No suf- fix or d will
interpret the number interval-between-checks as days, m as
months, and w as weeks. A value of zero will disable the
time-dependent checking.</p>

<p>It is strongly recommended that either -c
(mount-count-depen- dent) or -i (time-dependent) checking be
enabled to force peri- odic full e2fsck(8) checking of the
filesystem. Failure to do so may lead to filesystem
corruption (due to bad disks, cables, memory, or kernel
bugs) going unnoticed, ultimately resulting in data loss or
corruption.</p>

<p>-j Add an ext3 journal to the filesystem. If the -J
option is not specified, the default journal parameters will
be used to create an appropriately sized journal (given the
size of the filesys- tem) stored within the filesystem. Note
that you must be using a kernel which has ext3 support in
order to actually make use of the journal.</p>

<p>If this option is used to create a journal on a mounted
filesys- tem, an immutable file, .journal, will be created
in the top- level directory of the filesystem, as it is the
only safe way to create the journal inode while the
filesystem is mounted. While the ext3 journal is visible, it
is not safe to delete it, or modify it while the filesystem
is mounted; for this reason the file is marked immutable.
While checking unmounted filesystems, e2fsck(8) will
automatically move .journal files to the invisi- ble,
reserved journal inode. For all filesystems except for the
root filesystem, this should happen automatically and
naturally during the next reboot cycle. Since the root
filesystem is mounted read-only, e2fsck(8) must be run from
a rescue floppy in order to effect this transition.</p>

<p>On some distributions, such as Debian, if an initial
ramdisk is used, the initrd scripts will automatically
convert an ext2 root filesystem to ext3 if the /etc/fstab
file specifies the ext3 filesystem for the root filesystem
in order to avoid requiring the use of a rescue floppy to
add an ext3 journal to the root filesystem.</p>

<p>-J journal-options Override the default ext3 journal
parameters. Journal options are comma separated, and may
take an argument using the equals ( = ) sign. The following
journal options are supported:</p>

<p>size=journal-size Create a journal stored in the
filesystem of size journal-size megabytes. The size of the
journal must be at least 1024 filesystem blocks (i.e., 1MB
if using 1k blocks, 4MB if using 4k blocks, etc.) and may be
no more than 102,400 filesystem blocks. There must be enough
free space in the filesystem to create a journal of that
size.</p>

<p>device=external-journal Attach the filesystem to the
journal block device located on external-journal. The
external journal must have been already created using the
command</p>

<p>mke2fs -O journal_dev external-journal</p>

<p>Note that external-journal must be formatted with the
same block size as filesystems which will be using it. In
addition, while there is support for attaching multiple
filesystems to a single external journal, the Linux kernel
and e2fsck(8) do not cur- rently support shared external
journals yet.</p>

<p>Instead of specifying a device name directly, exter-
nal-journal can also be specified by either LABEL=label or
UUID=UUID to locate the external journal by either the
volume label or UUID stored in the ext2 superblock at the
start of the journal. Use dumpe2fs(8) to display a journal
devices volume label and UUID. See also the -L option of
tune2fs(8).</p>

<p>Only one of the size or device options can be given for
a filesystem.</p>

<p>-l List the contents of the filesystem superblock,
including the current values of the parameters that can be
set via this program.</p>

<p>-L volume-label Set the volume label of the filesystem.
Ext2 filesystem labels can be at most 16 characters long; if
volume-label is longer than 16 characters, tune2fs will
truncate it and print a warn- ing. The volume label can be
used by mount(8), fsck(8), and /etc/fstab(5) (and possibly
others) by specifying LABEL=vol- ume_label instead of a
block special device name like /dev/hda5.</p>

<p>-m reserved-blocks-percentage Set the percentage of the
filesystem which may only be allocated by privileged
processes. Reserving some number of filesystem blocks for
use by privileged processes is done to avoid filesys- tem
fragmentation, and to allow system daemons, such as sys-
logd(8), to continue to function correctly after
non-privileged processes are prevented from writing to the
filesystem. Nor- mally, the default percentage of reserved
blocks is 5%.</p>

<p>-M last-mounted-directory Set the last-mounted directory
for the filesystem.</p>

<p>-o [^]mount-option[,...] Set or clear the indicated
default mount options in the filesys- tem. Default mount
options can be overridden by mount options specified either
in /etc/fstab(5) or on the command line argu- ments to
mount(8). Older kernels may not support this feature; in
particular, kernels which predate 2.4.20 will almost cer-
tainly ignore the default mount options field in the
superblock.</p>

<p>More than one mount option can be cleared or set by
separating features with commas. Mount options prefixed with
a caret char- acter ( ^ ) will be cleared in the filesystems
superblock; mount options without a prefix character or
prefixed with a plus character (+) will be added to the
filesystem.</p>

<p>The following mount options can be set or cleared using
tune2fs:</p>

<p>debug Enable debugging code for this filesystem.</p>

<p>bsdgroups Emulate BSD behaviour when creating new files:
they will take the group-id of the directory in which they
were created. The standard System V behaviour is the
default, where newly created files take on the fsgid of the
current process, unless the direc- tory has the setgid bit
set, in which case it takes the gid from the parent
directory, and also gets the setgid bit set if it is a
directory itself.</p>

<p>user_xattr Enable user-specified extended
attributes.</p>

<p>acl Enable Posix Access Control Lists.</p>

<p>uid16 Disables 32-bit UIDs and GIDs. This is for
interop- erability with older kernels which only store and
expect 16-bit values.</p>

<p>journal_data When the filesystem is mounted with
journalling enabled, all data (not just metadata) is
committed into the journal prior to being written into the
main filesystem.</p>

<p>journal_data_ordered When the filesystem is mounted with
journalling enabled, all data is forced directly out to the
main file system prior to its metadata being committed to
the journal.</p>

<p>journal_data_writeback When the filesystem is mounted
with journalling enabled, data may be written into the main
filesys- tem after its metadata has been committed to the
journal. This may increase throughput, however, it may allow
old data to appear in files after a crash and journal
recovery.</p>

<p>-O [^]feature[,...] Set or clear the indicated
filesystem features (options) in the filesystem. More than
one filesystem feature can be cleared or set by separating
features with commas. Filesystem features prefixed with a
caret character ( ^ ) will be cleared in the filesystem s
superblock; filesystem features without a prefix character
or prefixed with a plus character ( + ) will be added to the
filesystem.</p>

<p>The following filesystem features can be set or cleared
using tune2fs:</p>

<p>dir_index Use hashed b-trees to speed up lookups in
large directories.</p>

<p>filetype Store file type information in directory
entries.</p>

<p>flex_bg Allow bitmaps and inode tables for a block group
to be placed anywhere on the storage media. Tune2fs will not
reorganize the location of the inode tables and allocation
bitmaps, as mke2fs(8) will do when it creates a freshly
formated file system with flex_bg enabled.</p>

<p>has_journal Use a journal to ensure filesystem
consistency even across unclean shutdowns. Setting the
filesystem feature is equivalent to using the -j option.</p>

<p>large_file Filesystem can contain files that are greater
than 2GB. (Modern kernels set this feature automatically
when a file &gt; 2GB is created.)</p>

<p>resize_inode Reserve space so the block group descriptor
table may grow in the future. Tune2fs only supports clearing
this filesystem feature.</p>

<p>sparse_super Limit the number of backup superblocks to
save space on large filesystems.</p>

<p>uninit_bg Allow the kernel to initialize bitmaps and
inode tables and keep a high watermark for the unused inodes
in a filesystem, to reduce e2fsck(8) time. This first e2fsck
run after enabling this feature will take the full time, but
subsequent e2fsck runs will take only a fraction of the
original time, depending on how full the file system is.</p>

<p>After setting or clearing sparse_super, uninit_bg,
filetype, or resize_inode filesystem features, e2fsck(8)
must be run on the filesystem to return the filesystem to a
consistent state. Tune2fs will print a message requesting
that the system adminis- trator run e2fsck(8) if necessary.
After setting the dir_index feature, e2fsck -D can be run to
convert existing directories to the hashed B-tree format.
Enabling certain filesystem features may prevent the
filesystem from being mounted by kernels which do not
support those features. In particular, the uninit_bg and
flex_bg features are only supported by the ext4
filesystem.</p>

<p>-r reserved-blocks-count Set the number of reserved
filesystem blocks.</p>

<p>-T time-last-checked Set the time the filesystem was
last checked using e2fsck. The time is interpreted using the
current (local) timezone. This can be useful in scripts
which use a Logical Volume Manager to make a consistent
snapshot of a filesystem, and then check the filesystem
during off hours to make sure it hasnt been cor- rupted due
to hardware problems, etc. If the filesystem was clean, then
this option can be used to set the last checked time on the
original filesystem. The format of time-last-checked is the
international date format, with an optional time specifier,
i.e. YYYYMMDD[HH[MM[SS]]]. The keyword now is also accepted,
in which case the last checked time will be set to the
current time.</p>

<p>-u user Set the user who can use the reserved filesystem
blocks. user can be a numerical uid or a user name. If a
user name is given, it is converted to a numerical uid
before it is stored in the superblock.</p>

<p>-U UUID Set the universally unique identifier (UUID) of
the filesystem to UUID. The format of the UUID is a series
of hex digits sepa- rated by hyphens, like this:
&quot;c1b9d5a2-f162-11cf-9ece-0020afc76f16&quot;. The UUID
parameter may also be one of the following:</p>

<p>clear clear the filesystem UUID</p>

<p>random generate a new randomly-generated UUID</p>

<p>time generate a new time-based UUID</p>

<p>The UUID may be used by mount(8), fsck(8), and
/etc/fstab(5) (and possibly others) by specifying UUID=uuid
instead of a block special device name like /dev/hda1.</p>

<p>See uuidgen(8) for more information. If the system does
not have a good random number generator such as /dev/random
or /dev/urandom, tune2fs will automatically use a time-based
UUID instead of a randomly-generated UUID.</p>
