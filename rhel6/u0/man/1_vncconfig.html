<p>NAME vncconfig - configure and control a VNC server</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS vncconfig [parameters] vncconfig [parameters]
-connect host[:port] vncconfig [parameters] -disconnect
vncconfig [parameters] [-set] Xvnc-param=value ... vncconfig
[parameters] -list vncconfig [parameters] -get Xvnc-param
vncconfig [parameters] -desc Xvnc-param</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION vncconfig is used to configure and control a
running instance of Xvnc, or any other X server with the VNC
extension. Note that it cannot be used to control VNC
servers prior to version 4.</p>

<p>When run with no options, it runs as a kind of
&quot;helper&quot; application for Xvnc. Its main purpose
when run in this mode is to support clipboard transfer to
and from the VNC viewer(s). Note that without a running
instance of vncconfig there will be no clipboard support. It
puts up a window with some checkboxes which can be used to
disable clipboard transfers if required (in the future there
may be more functions avail- able from this window). The
-nowin flag can be used if you always want clipboard support
but don t wish to clutter the desktop with this win- dow -
alternatively the -iconic option can be used to make it
iconified by default.</p>

<p>When run in any other mode, vncconfig is a one-shot
program used to configure or control Xvnc as appropriate. It
can be used to tell Xvnc to connect or disconnect from
listening viewers, and to set and retrieve Xvncs
parameters.</p>

<p>Note that the DISPLAY environment variable or the
-display option must be set as appropriate to control Xvnc.
If you run it on an ordinary X server (or on a version 3
Xvnc) you will get an error message saying that there is no
VNC extension.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -connect host[:port] Tells an Xvnc server to
make a &quot;reverse&quot; connection to a listen- ing VNC
viewer (normally connections are made the other way round -
the viewer connects to the server). host is the host where
the listening viewer is running. If its not listening on the
default port of 5500, you can specify host:port instead.</p>

<p>-disconnect This causes Xvnc to disconnect from all
viewers so that the VNC desktop is not displayed
anywhere.</p>

<p>[-set] Xvnc-param=value Sets an Xvnc parameter to the
given value. Note that some of Xvncs parameters are read
only once at startup so that changing them in this way may
not have any effect.</p>

<p>-list Lists all the parameters supported by Xvnc.</p>

<p>-get Xvnc-param Prints the current value of the given
Xvnc parameter.</p>

<p>-desc Xvnc-param Prints a short description of the given
Xvnc parameter.</p>

<p>PARAMETERS vncconfig also has parameters of its own
which can be set on the com- mand line. These should not be
confused with Xvnc s parameters which are manipulated with
the -set, -get, -list and -desc options.</p>

<p>Parameters can be turned on with -param or off with
-param=0. Parame- ters which take a value can be specified
as -param value. Other valid forms are param=value
-param=value --param=value. Parameter names are
case-insensitive.</p>

<p>-display Xdisplay Specifies the Xvnc server to
control.</p>

<p>-nowin When run as a &quot;helper&quot; app, dont put up
a window.</p>

<p>-iconic When run as a &quot;helper&quot; app, make the
window iconified at startup.</p>
