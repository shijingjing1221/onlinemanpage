<p>TCSENDBREAK(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
TCSENDBREAK(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME tcsendbreak - send a break for a specific
duration</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;termios.h&gt;</p>

<p>int tcsendbreak(int fildes, int duration);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION If the terminal is using asynchronous serial
data transmission, tcsend- break() shall cause transmission
of a continuous stream of zero-valued bits for a specific
duration. If duration is 0, it shall cause trans- mission of
zero-valued bits for at least 0.25 seconds, and not more
than 0.5 seconds. If duration is not 0, it shall send
zero-valued bits for an implementation-defined period of
time.</p>

<p>The fildes argument is an open file descriptor
associated with a termi- nal.</p>

<p>If the terminal is not using asynchronous serial data
transmission, it is implementation-defined whether
tcsendbreak() sends data to generate a break condition or
returns without taking any action.</p>

<p>Attempts to use tcsendbreak() from a process which is a
member of a background process group on a fildes associated
with its controlling terminal shall cause the process group
to be sent a SIGTTOU signal. If the calling process is
blocking or ignoring SIGTTOU signals, the pro- cess shall be
allowed to perform the operation, and no signal is sent.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, 0 shall be
returned. Otherwise, -1 shall be returned and errno set to
indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The tcsendbreak() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EBADF The fildes argument is not a valid file
descriptor.</p>

<p>ENOTTY The file associated with fildes is not a
terminal.</p>

<p>The tcsendbreak() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EIO The process group of the writing process is
orphaned, and the writing process is not ignoring or
blocking SIGTTOU.</p>
