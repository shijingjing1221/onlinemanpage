<p>NAME libcurl-easy - easy interface overview</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION When using libcurl s &quot;easy&quot;
interface you init your session and get a handle (often
referred to as an &quot;easy handle&quot;), which you use as
input to the easy interface functions you use. Use
curl_easy_init(3) to get the handle.</p>

<p>You continue by setting all the options you want in the
upcoming trans- fer, the most important among them is the
URL itself (you cant trans- fer anything without a specified
URL as you may have figured out your- self). You might want
to set some callbacks as well that will be called from the
library when data is available etc. curl_easy_setopt(3) is
used for all this.</p>

<p>When all is setup, you tell libcurl to perform the
transfer using curl_easy_perform(3). It will then do the
entire operation and wont return until it is done
(successfully or not).</p>

<p>After the transfer has been made, you can set new
options and make another transfer, or if youre done, cleanup
the session by calling curl_easy_cleanup(3). If you want
persistent connections, you dont cleanup immediately, but
instead run ahead and perform other transfers using the same
easy handle.</p>
