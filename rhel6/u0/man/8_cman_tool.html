<p>NAME cman_tool - Cluster Management Tool</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS cman_tool join | leave | kill | expected |
votes | version | wait | status | nodes | services | debug
[options]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION cman_tool is a program that manages the
cluster management subsystem CMAN. cman_tool can be used to
join the node to a cluster, leave the cluster, kill another
cluster node or change the value of expected votes of a
cluster. Be careful that you understand the consequences of
the commands issued via cman_tool as they can affect all
nodes in your cluster. Most of the time the cman_tool will
only be invoked from your startup and shutdown scripts.</p>

<p>SUBCOMMANDS join This is the main use of cman_tool. It
instructs the cluster man- ager to attempt to join an
existing cluster or (if no existing cluster exists) then to
form a new one on its own. If no options are given to this
command then it will take the cluster configuration
information from cluster.conf. However, it is possible to
provide all the information on the command-line or to
override cluster.conf values by using the command line.</p>

<p>leave Tells CMAN to leave the cluster. You cannot do
this if there are subsystems (eg DLM, GFS) active. You
should dismount all GFS filesystems, shutdown CLVM, fenced
and anything else using the cluster manager before using
cman_tool leave. Look at cman_tool status and group_tool to
see how many (and which) subsystems are active. When a node
leaves the cluster, the remaining nodes recalculate quorum
and this may block cluster activity if the required num- ber
of votes is not present. If this node is to be down for an
extended period of time and you need to keep the cluster
run- ning, add the remove option, and the remaining nodes
will recal- culate quorum such that activity can
continue.</p>

<p>kill Tells CMAN to kill another node in the cluster.
This will cause the local node to send a &quot;KILL&quot;
message to that node and it will shut down. Recovery will
occur for the killed node as if it had failed. This is a
sort of remote version of &quot;leave force&quot; so only
use if if you really know what you are doing.</p>

<p>expected Tells CMAN a new value of expected votes and
instructs it to recalculate quorum based on this value. Use
this option if your cluster has lost quorum due to nodes
failing and you need to get it running again in a hurry.</p>

<p>version Used alone this will report the major, minor,
patch and config versions used by CMAN (also displayed in
cman_tool status). It can also be used with -r to tell
cluster members to update. The argument to -r is the version
number that cman should look for. If that version is not
currently available then cman will poll for it. If a version
of 0 is specified then cman will read the configuration
file, validate it, distribute it around the cluster (if
necessary) and activate it. The -D flag can disable the
validation stage. This is NOT recom- mended.</p>

<p>wait Waits until the node is a member of the cluster and
then returns.</p>

<p>status Displays the local view of the cluster
status.</p>

<p>nodes Displays the local view of the cluster nodes.</p>

<p>services Displays the local view of subsystems using
cman (deprecated, group_tool should be used instead).</p>

<p>debug Sets the debug level of the running cman daemon.
Debug output will be sent to syslog level LOG_DEBUG. the -d
switch specifies the new logging level. This is the same
bitmask used for cman_tool join -d</p>

<p>LEAVE OPTIONS -w Normally, &quot;cman_tool leave&quot;
will fail if the cluster is in tran- sition (ie another node
is joining or leaving the cluster). By adding the -w flag,
cman_tool will wait and retry the leave operation repeatedly
until it succeeds or a more serious error occurs.</p>

<p>-t &lt;seconds&gt; If -w is also specified then -t
dictates the maximum amount of time cman_tool is prepared to
wait. If the operation times out then a status of 2 is
returned.</p>

<p>force Shuts down the cluster manager without first
telling any of the subsystems to close down. Use this option
with extreme care as it could easily cause data loss.</p>

<p>remove Tells the rest of the cluster to recalculate
quorum such that activity can continue without this
node.</p>

<p>EXPECTED OPTIONS -e &lt;expected-votes&gt; The new value
of expected votes to use. This will usually be enough to
bring the cluster back to life. Values that would cause
incorrect quorum will be rejected.</p>

<p>KILL OPTIONS -n &lt;nodename&gt; The node name of the
node to be killed. This should be the unqualified node name
as it appears in cman_tool nodes.</p>

<p>VERSION OPTIONS -r Update config version. You dont need
to use this when adding a new node, the new cman node will
tell the rest of the cluster to read the latest version of
the config file automatically. The version present in the
new configuration must be higher than the one currently in
use by cman.</p>

<p>cman_tool version on its own will always show the
current ver- sion and not the one being looked for. So be
aware that the dis- play will possibly not update
immediately after you have run cman_tool version -r.</p>

<p>-D&lt;option&gt; see &quot;JOIN&quot; options</p>

<p>-S By default cman_tool version will try to distribute
the new cluster.conf file using ccs_sync and ricci. If you
have dis- tributed the file yourself and/or do not have
ricci installed then the -S option will skip this step.
NOTE: it is still important that all nodes in the cluster
have the same version of the file. Make sure that this is
the case before using this option.</p>

<p>WAIT OPTIONS -q Waits until the cluster is quorate
before returning. -t &lt;sec- onds&gt; Dictates the maximum
amount of time cman_tool is prepared to wait. If the
operation times out then a status of 2 is returned.</p>

<p>JOIN OPTIONS -c &lt;clustername&gt; Provides a text name
for the cluster. You can have several clus- ters on one LAN
and they are distinguished by this name. Note that the name
is hashed to provide a unique number which is what actually
distinguishes the cluster, so it is possible that two
different names can clash. If this happens, the node will
not be allowed into the existing cluster and you will have
to pick another name or use different port number for
cluster communica- tion.</p>

<p>-p &lt;port&gt; UDP port number used for cluster
communication. This defaults to 5405.</p>

<p>-v &lt;votes&gt; Number of votes this node has in the
cluster. Defaults to 1.</p>

<p>-e &lt;expected votes&gt; Number of expected votes for
the whole cluster. If different nodes provide different
values then the highest is used. The cluster will only
operate when quorum is reached - that is more than half the
available votes are available to the cluster. The default
for this value is the total number of votes for all nodes in
the configuration file.</p>

<p>-2 Sets the cluster up for a special &quot;two node
only&quot; mode. Because of the quorum requirements
mentioned above, a two-node cluster cannot be valid. This
option tells the cluster manager that there will only ever
be two nodes in the cluster and relies on fencing to ensure
cluster integrity. If you specify this you cannot add more
nodes without taking down the existing cluster and
reconfiguring it. Expected votes should be set to 1 for a
two-node cluster.</p>

<p>-n &lt;nodename&gt; Overrides the node name. By default
the unqualified hostname is used. This option is also used
to specify which interface is used for cluster
communication.</p>

<p>-N &lt;nodeid&gt; Overrides the node ID for this node.
Normally, nodes are assigned a node id in cluster.conf. If
you specify an incorrect node ID here, the node might not be
allowed to join the cluster. Setting node IDs in the
configuration is a far better way to do this. Note that the
nodes application to join the cluster may be rejected if you
try to set the nodeid to one that has already been used, or
if the node was previously a member of the cluster but with
a different nodeid.</p>

<p>-o &lt;nodename&gt; Override the name this node will
have in the cluster. This will normally be the hostname or
the first name specified by -n. Note how this differs from
-n: -n tells cman_tool how to find the host address and/or
the entry in the configuration file. -o simply changes the
name the node will have in the cluster and has no bearing on
the actual name of the machine. Use this option will extreme
caution.</p>

<p>-m &lt;multicast-address&gt; Specifies a multicast
address to use for cluster communication. This is required
for IPv6 operation. You should also specify an ethernet
interface to bind to this multicast address using the -i
option.</p>

<p>-w Join and wait until the node is a cluster member.</p>

<p>-q Join and wait until the cluster is quorate. If the
cluster join fails and -w (or -q) is specified, then it will
be retried. Note that cman_tool cannot tell whether the
cluster join was rejected by another node for a good reason
or that it timed out for some benign reason; so it is
strongly recommended that a timeout is also given with the
wait options to join. If you dont want join to retry on
failure but do want to wait, use the cman_tool join command
without -w followed by cman_tool wait.</p>

<p>-k &lt;keyfile&gt; All traffic sent out by cman/corosync
is encrypted. By default the security key used is simply the
cluster name. If you need more security you can specify a
key file that contains the key used to encrypt cluster
communications. Of course, the contents of the key file must
be the same on all nodes in the cluster. It is up to you to
securely copy the file to the nodes.</p>

<p>-t &lt;seconds&gt; If -w or -q is also specified then -t
dictates the maximum amount of time cman_tool is prepared to
wait. If the operation times out then a status of 2 is
returned. Note that just because cman_tool has given up,
does not mean that cman itself has stopped trying to join a
cluster.</p>

<p>-X Tells cman not to use the configuration file to get
cluster information. If you use this option then cman will
apply several defaults to the cluster to get it going. The
cluster name will be &quot;RHCluster&quot;, node IDs will
default to the IP address of the node and remote node names
will show up as Node&lt;nodeid&gt;. All of these, apart from
the node names can be overridden on the cman_tool
command-line if required. If you have to set up fence
devices, services or anything else in cluster.conf then this
option is probably not worthwhile to you - the extra
readability of sensible node names and numbers will make it
worth using cluster.conf for the cluster too. But for a
simple failover cluster this might save you some effort. On
each node using this configuration you will need to have the
same authorization key installed. To create this key run
corosync-keygen mv /etc/ais/authkey
/etc/cluster/cman_authkey then copy that file to all nodes
you want to join the cluster.</p>

<p>-C Overrides the default configuration module. Usually
cman uses xmlconfig (cluster.conf) to load its
configuration. If you have your configuration database held
elsewhere (eg LDAP) and have a configuration plugin for it,
then you should specify the name of the module (see the
documentation for the module for the name of it - its not
necessarily the same as the filename) here. It is possible
to chain configuration modules by separating them with
colons. So to add two modules (eg) configloader and con-
figpreproc to the chain start cman with -C
configloader:config- preproc The default value for this is
xmlconfig. Note that if the -X is on the command-line then
-C will be ignored.</p>

<p>-A Dont load openais services. Normally cman_tool join
will load the configuration module
openaisserviceenablestable which will load the services
installed by openais. If you dont want to use these services
or have not installed openais then this switch will disable
them.</p>

<p>-D Tells cman_tool whether to validate the configuration
before loading or reloading it. By default the configuration
is vali- dated, which is equivalent to -Dfail. -Dwarn will
validate the configuration and print any messages arising,
but will attempt to use it regardless of its validity.
-Dnone (or just -D) will skip the validation completely. The
-D switch does not take a space between -D and the parame-
ter. so -D fail will cause an error. Use -Dfail.</p>

<p>NODES OPTIONS -a Shows the IP address(es) the nodes are
communicating on.</p>

<p>-n &lt;nodename&gt; Shows node information for a
specific node. This should be the unqualified node name as
it appears in cman_tool nodes.</p>

<p>-F &lt;format&gt; Specify the format of the output. The
format string may contain one or more format options, each
separated by a comma. Valid format options include: id,
name, type, and addr.</p>

<p>DEBUG OPTIONS -d &lt;value&gt; The value is a bitmask of
2 Barriers 4 Membership messages 8 Daemon operation,
including command-line interaction 16 Interaction with
Corosync 32 Startup debugging (cman_tool join operations
only)</p>

<p>NOTES the nodes subcommand shows a list of nodes known
to cman. the state is one of the following: M The node is a
member of the cluster X The node is not a member of the
cluster d The node is known to the cluster but disallowed
access to it.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES cman_tool removes most environment
variables before forking and running Corosync, as well as
adding some of its own for setting up configura- tion
parameters that were overridden on the command-line, the
exception to this is that variable with names starting
COROSYNC_ will be passed down intact as they are assumed to
be used for configuring the daemon.</p>

<p>DISALLOWED NODES Occasionally (but very infrequently I
hope) you may see nodes marked as &quot;Disallowed&quot; in
cman_tool status or &quot;d&quot; in cman_tool nodes. This
is a bit of a nasty hack to get around mismatch between what
the upper lay- ers expect of the cluster manager and
corosync.</p>

<p>If a node experiences a momentary lack of connectivity,
but one that is long enough to trigger the token timeouts,
then it will be removed from the cluster. When connectivity
is restored corosync will happily let it rejoin the cluster
with no fuss. Sadly the upper layers dont like this very
much. They may (indeed probably will have) have changed
their internal state while the other node was away and there
is no straight- forward way to bring the rejoined node
up-to-date with that state. When this happens the node is
marked &quot;Disallowed&quot; and is not permitted to take
part in cman operations.</p>

<p>If the remainder of the cluster is quorate the the node
will be sent a kill message and it will be forced to leave
the cluster that way. Note that fencing should kick in to
remove the node permanently anyway, but it may take longer
than the network outage for this to complete.</p>

<p>If the remainder of the cluster is inquorate then we
have a problem. The likelihood is that we will have two (or
more) partitioned clusters and we cannot decide which is the
&quot;right&quot; one. In this case we need to defer to the
system administrator to kill an appropriate selection of
nodes to restore the cluster to sensible operation.</p>

<p>The latter scenario should be very rare and may indicate
a bug some- where in the code. If the local network is very
flaky or busy it may be necessary to increase some of the
protocol timeouts for corosync. We are trying to think of
better solutions to this problem.</p>

<p>Recovering from this state can, unfortunately, be
complicated. Fortu- nately, in the majority of cases,
fencing will do the job for you, and the disallowed state
will only be temporary. If it persists, the recom- mended
approach it is to do a cman tool nodes on all systems in the
cluster and determine the largest common subset of nodes
that are valid members to each other. Then reboot the others
and let them rejoin cor- rectly. In the case of a
single-node disconnection this should be straightforward,
with a large cluster that has experienced a network
partition it could get very complicated!</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>In this example we have a five node cluster that has
experienced a net- work partition. Here is the output of

node-05.example.com In this scenario we should kill the node
node-02 and node-03. Of course, the 3 node cluster of
node-01, node-04 &amp; node-05 should remain quorate and be
able to fenced the two rejoined nodes anyway, but it is
possible that the cluster has a qdisk setup that precludes
this.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION SYSTEMS This section details how the
configuration systems work in cman. You might need to know
this if you are using the -C option to cman_tool, or writing
your own configuration subsystem. By default cman uses two
configuration plugins to corosync. The first, xmlconfig,
reads the configuration information stored in cluster.conf
and stores it in an internal database, in the same schema as
it finds in cluster.conf. The second plugin, cmanpreconfig,
takes the infor- mation in that the database, adds several
cman defaults, determines the corosync node name and nodeID
and formats the information in a similar manner to
corosync.conf(5). Corosync then reads those keys to start
the cluster protocol. cmanpreconfig also reads several
environment vari- ables that might be set by cman_tool which
can override information in the configuration. In the
absence of xmlconfig, ie when cman_tool join is run with -X
switch (this removes xmlconfig from the module list),
cmanpreconfig also generates several defaults so that the
cluster can be got running without any configuration
information - see above for the details. Note that
cmanpreconfig will not overwrite corosync keys that are
explicitly set in the configuration file, allowing you to
provide cus- tom values for token timeouts etc, even though
cman has its own defaults for some of those values. The
exception to this is the node name/address and multicast
values, which are always taken from the cman configuration
keys. Most of the extra keys that cmanpreconfig adds are
outside of the /cluster/ tree and will only be seen if you
dump the whole of corosync s object database. However it
does add some keys into /clus- ter/cman that you would not
normally see in a normal cluster.conf file. These are
harmless, though could be confusing. The most obvious of
these is the &quot;nodename&quot; option which is passed
from cmanpreconfig to the name cman module, to save it
recalculating the node name again.</p>
