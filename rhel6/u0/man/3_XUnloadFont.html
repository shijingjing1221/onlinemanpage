<p>XLoadFont(3) XLIB FUNCTIONS XLoadFont(3)</p>

<p>NAME XLoadFont, XQueryFont, XLoadQueryFont, XFreeFont,
XGetFontProperty, XUnloadFont, XCharStruct, XFontProp,
XChar2b, XFontStruct - load or unload fonts and font metric
structures</p>

<p>SYNTAX Font XLoadFont(Display *display, char *name);</p>

<p>XFontStruct *XQueryFont(Display *display, XID
font_ID);</p>

<p>XFontStruct *XLoadQueryFont(Display *display, char
*name);</p>

*font_struct);</p>

<p>Bool XGetFontProperty(XFontStruct *font_struct, Atom
atom, unsigned long *value_return);</p>

<p>int XUnloadFont(Display *display, Font font);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS atom Specifies the atom for the property name
you want returned.</p>

<p>display Specifies the connection to the X server.</p>

<p>font Specifies the font.</p>

<p>font_ID Specifies the font ID or the GContext ID.</p>

<p>font_struct Specifies the storage associated with the
font.</p>

<p>gc Specifies the GC.</p>

<p>name Specifies the name of the font, which is a
null-terminated string.</p>

<p>value_return Returns the value of the font property.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The XLoadFont function loads the specified
font and returns its associ- ated font ID. If the font name
is not in the Host Portable Character Encoding, the result
is implementation-dependent. Use of uppercase or lowercase
does not matter. When the characters ? and * are used in a
font name, a pattern match is performed and any matching
font is used. In the pattern, the ? character will match any
single character, and the * character will match any number
of characters. A structured format for font names is
specified in the X Consortium standard X Logical Font
Description Conventions. If XLoadFont was unsuccessful at
loading the specified font, a BadName error results. Fonts
are not associated with a particular screen and can be
stored as a component of any GC. When the font is no longer
needed, call XUn- loadFont.</p>

<p>XLoadFont can generate BadAlloc and BadName errors.</p>

<p>The XQueryFont function returns a pointer to the
XFontStruct structure, which contains information associated
with the font. You can query a font or the font stored in a
GC. The font ID stored in the XFontStruct structure will be
the GContext ID, and you need to be careful when using this
ID in other functions (see XGContextFromGC). If the font
does not exist, XQueryFont returns NULL. To free this data,
use XFreeFontInfo.</p>

<p>XLoadQueryFont can generate a BadAlloc error.</p>

<p>The XLoadQueryFont function provides the most common way
for accessing a font. XLoadQueryFont both opens (loads) the
specified font and returns a pointer to the appropriate
XFontStruct structure. If the font name is not in the Host
Portable Character Encoding, the result is
implementation-dependent. If the font does not exist,
XLoadQueryFont returns NULL.</p>

<p>The XFreeFont function deletes the association between
the font resource ID and the specified font and frees the
XFontStruct structure. The font itself will be freed when no
other resource references it. The data and the font should
not be referenced again.</p>

<p>XFreeFont can generate a BadFont error.</p>

<p>Given the atom for that property, the XGetFontProperty
function returns the value of the specified font property.
XGetFontProperty also returns False if the property was not
defined or True if it was defined. A set of predefined atoms
exists for font properties, which can be found in
&lt;X11/Xatom.h&gt;. This set contains the standard proper-
ties associated with a font. Although it is not guaranteed,
it is likely that the predefined font properties will be
present.</p>

<p>The XUnloadFont function deletes the association between
the font resource ID and the specified font. The font itself
will be freed when no other resource references it. The font
should not be referenced again.</p>

<p>XUnloadFont can generate a BadFont error.</p>

<p>STRUCTURES The XFontStruct structure contains all of the
information for the font and consists of the font-specific
information as well as a pointer to an array of XCharStruct
structures for the characters contained in the font. The
XFontStruct, XFontProp, and XCharStruct structures
contain:</p>

<p>typedef struct { short lbearing; /* origin to left edge
of raster */ short rbearing; /* origin to right edge of
raster */ short width; /* advance to next chars origin */
short ascent; /* baseline to top edge of raster */ short
descent; /* baseline to bottom edge of raster */ unsigned
short attributes; /* per char flags (not predefined) */ }
XCharStruct;</p>

<p>typedef struct { Atom name; unsigned long card32; }
XFontProp;</p>

<p>typedef struct { /* normal 16 bit characters are two
bytes */ unsigned char byte1; unsigned char byte2; }
XChar2b;</p>

<p>typedef struct { XExtData *ext_data; /* hook for
extension to hang data */ Font fid; /* Font id for this font
*/ unsigned direction; /* hint about the direction font is
painted */ unsigned min_char_or_byte2; /* first character */
unsigned max_char_or_byte2; /* last character */ unsigned
min_byte1; /* first row that exists */ unsigned max_byte1;
/* last row that exists */ Bool all_chars_exist; /* flag if
all characters have nonzero size */ unsigned default_char;
/* char to print for undefined character */ int
n_properties; /* how many properties there are */ XFontProp
*properties; /* pointer to array of additional properties */
XCharStruct min_bounds; /* minimum bounds over all existing
char */ XCharStruct max_bounds; /* maximum bounds over all
existing char */ XCharStruct *per_char; /* first_char to
last_char information */ int ascent; /* logical extent above
baseline for spacing */ int descent; /* logical decent below
baseline for spacing */ } XFontStruct;</p>

<p>X supports single byte/character, two bytes/character
matrix, and 16-bit character text operations. Note that any
of these forms can be used with a font, but a single
byte/character text request can only specify a single byte
(that is, the first row of a 2-byte font). You should view
2-byte fonts as a two-dimensional matrix of defined charac-
ters: byte1 specifies the range of defined rows and byte2
defines the range of defined columns of the font. Single
byte/character fonts have one row defined, and the byte2
range specified in the structure defines a range of
characters.</p>

<p>The bounding box of a character is defined by the
XCharStruct of that character. When characters are absent
from a font, the default_char is used. When fonts have all
characters of the same size, only the infor- mation in the
XFontStruct min and max bounds are used.</p>

<p>The members of the XFontStruct have the following
semantics:</p>

<p>&middot; The direction member can be either
FontLeftToRight or FontRight- ToLeft. It is just a hint as
to whether most XCharStruct elements have a positive
(FontLeftToRight) or a negative (FontRightToLeft) character
width metric. The core protocol defines no support for
vertical text.</p>

<p>&middot; If the min_byte1 and max_byte1 members are both
zero, min_char_or_byte2 specifies the linear character index
correspond- ing to the first element of the per_char array,
and max_char_or_byte2 specifies the linear character index
of the last element.</p>

<p>If either min_byte1 or max_byte1 are nonzero, both
min_char_or_byte2 and max_char_or_byte2 are less than 256,
and the 2-byte character index values corresponding to the
per_char array element N (counting from 0) are:</p>

<p>byte1 = N/D + min_byte1 byte2 = Nmin_char_or_byte2</p>

<p>where:</p>

<p>D = max_char_or_byte2 - min_char_or_byte2 + 1 / =
integer division \ = integer modulus</p>

<p>&middot; If the per_char pointer is NULL, all glyphs
between the first and last character indexes inclusive have
the same information, as given by both min_bounds and
max_bounds.</p>

<p>&middot; If all_chars_exist is True, all characters in
the per_char array have nonzero bounding boxes.</p>

<p>&middot; The default_char member specifies the character
that will be used when an undefined or nonexistent character
is printed. The default_char is a 16-bit character (not a
2-byte character). For a font using 2-byte matrix format,
the default_char has byte1 in the most-significant byte and
byte2 in the least significant byte. If the default_char
itself specifies an undefined or nonexistent character, no
printing is performed for an undefined or nonexis- tent
character.</p>

<p>&middot; The min_bounds and max_bounds members contain
the most extreme values of each individual XCharStruct
component over all elements of this array (and ignore
nonexistent characters). The bounding box of the font (the
smallest rectangle enclosing the shape obtained by
superimposing all of the characters at the same origin
[x,y]) has its upper-left coordinate at: [x +
min_bounds.lbearing, y - max_bounds.ascent]</p>

<p>Its width is: max_bounds.rbearing -
min_bounds.lbearing</p>

<p>Its height is: max_bounds.ascent +
max_bounds.descent</p>

<p>&middot; The ascent member is the logical extent of the
font above the baseline that is used for determining line
spacing. Specific characters may extend beyond this.</p>

<p>&middot; The descent member is the logical extent of the
font at or below the baseline that is used for determining
line spacing. Specific characters may extend beyond
this.</p>

<p>&middot; If the baseline is at Y-coordinate y, the
logical extent of the font is inclusive between the
Y-coordinate values (y - font.ascent) and (y + font.descent
- 1). Typically, the minimum interline spacing between rows
of text is given by ascent + descent.</p>

<p>For a character origin at [x,y], the bounding box of a
character (that is, the smallest rectangle that encloses the
characters shape) described in terms of XCharStruct
components is a rectangle with its upper-left corner at:</p>

<p>[x + lbearing, y - ascent]</p>

<p>Its width is:</p>

<p>rbearing - lbearing</p>

<p>Its height is:</p>

<p>ascent + descent</p>

<p>The origin for the next character is defined to be:</p>

<p>[x + width, y]</p>

<p>The lbearing member defines the extent of the left edge
of the charac- ter ink from the origin. The rbearing member
defines the extent of the right edge of the character ink
from the origin. The ascent member defines the extent of the
top edge of the character ink from the ori- gin. The descent
member defines the extent of the bottom edge of the
character ink from the origin. The width member defines the
logical width of the character.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS BadAlloc The server failed to allocate the
requested resource or server memory.</p>

<p>BadFont A value for a Font or GContext argument does not
name a defined Font.</p>

<p>BadName A font or color of the specified name does not
exist.</p>
