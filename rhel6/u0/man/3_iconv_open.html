<p>ICONV_OPEN(3) Linux Programmer s Manual
ICONV_OPEN(3)</p>

<p>NAME iconv_open - allocate descriptor for character set
conversion</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;iconv.h&gt;</p>

<p>iconv_t iconv_open(const char *tocode, const char
*fromcode);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The iconv_open() function allocates a
conversion descriptor suitable for converting byte sequences
from character encoding fromcode to char- acter encoding
tocode.</p>

<p>The values permitted for fromcode and tocode and the
supported combina- tions are system-dependent. For the GNU C
library, the permitted val- ues are listed by the iconv
--list command, and all combinations of the listed values
are supported. Furthermore the GNU C library and the GNU
libiconv library support the following two suffixes:</p>

<p>//TRANSLIT When the string &quot;//TRANSLIT&quot; is
appended to tocode, translitera- tion is activated. This
means that when a character cannot be represented in the
target character set, it can be approximated through one or
several similarly looking characters.</p>

<p>//IGNORE When the string &quot;//IGNORE&quot; is
appended to tocode, characters that cannot be represented in
the target character set will be silently discarded.</p>

<p>The resulting conversion descriptor can be used with
iconv(3) any num- ber of times. It remains valid until
deallocated using iconv_close(3).</p>

<p>A conversion descriptor contains a conversion state.
After creation using iconv_open(), the state is in the
initial state. Using iconv(3) modifies the descriptors
conversion state. (This implies that a con- version
descriptor can not be used in multiple threads
simultaneously.) To bring the state back to the initial
state, use iconv(3) with NULL as inbuf argument.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The iconv_open() function returns a freshly
allocated conversion descriptor. In case of error, it sets
errno and returns (iconv_t) -1.</p>

<p>ERRORS The following error can occur, among others:</p>

<p>EINVAL The conversion from fromcode to tocode is not
supported by the implementation.</p>

<p>VERSIONS This function is available in glibc since
version 2.1.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO UNIX98, POSIX.1-2001.</p>
