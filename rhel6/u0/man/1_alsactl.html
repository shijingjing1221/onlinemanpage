<p>NAME alsactl - advanced controls for ALSA soundcard
driver</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS alsactl [options] [store|restore|init] &lt;card
# or id or device&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION alsactl is used to control advanced settings
for the ALSA soundcard drivers. It supports multiple
soundcards. If your card has features that you cant seem to
control from a mixer application, you have come to the right
place.</p>

<p>COMMANDS store saves the current driver state for the
selected soundcard to the configuration file.</p>

<p>restore loads driver state for the selected soundcard
from the configu- ration file. If restoring fails
(eventually partly), the init action is called.</p>

<p>init tries to initialize all devices to a default state.
If device is not known, error code 99 is returned.</p>

<p>If no soundcards are specified, setup for all cards will
be saved or loaded.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -h, --help Help: show available flags and
commands.</p>

<p>-d, --debug Use debug mode: a bit more verbose.</p>

<p>-v, --version Print alsactl version number.</p>

<p>-f, --file Select the configuration file to use. The
default is /etc/asound.state.</p>

<p>-F, --force Used with restore command. Try to restore
the matching control elements as much as possible. This
option is set as default now.</p>

<p>-g, --ignore Used with store and restore commands. Do
not show No soundcards found and do not set an error exit
code when soundcards are not installed.</p>

<p>-P, --pedantic Used with restore command. Don t restore
mismatching control elements. This option was the old
default behavior.</p>

<p>-I, --no-init-fallback Dont initialize cards if restore
fails. Since version 1.0.18, alsactl tries to initialize the
card with the restore operation as default. But this can
cause incompatibility with the older version. The caller may
expect that the state wont be touched if no state file
exists. This option takes the restore behavior back to the
older version by suppressing the initialization.</p>

<p>-r, --runstate Save restore and init state to this file.
The file will contain only errors. Errors are appended with
the soundcard id to the end of file.</p>

<p>-R, --remove Remove runstate file at first.</p>

<p>-E, --env #=# Set environment variable (useful for init
action or you may override ALSA_CONFIG_PATH to read
different or optimized config- uration - may be useful for
&quot;boot&quot; scripts).</p>

<p>-i, --initfile #=# The configuration file for init. By
default, PRE- FIX/share/alsa/init/00main is used.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/asound.state (or whatever file you specify
with the -f flag) is used to store current settings for your
soundcards. The settings include all the usual soundcard
mixer settings. More importantly, als- actl is capable of
controlling other card-specific features that mixer apps
usually dont know about.</p>

<p>The configuration file is generated automatically by
running alsactl store. Editing the configuration file by
hand may be necessary for some soundcard features (e.g.
enabling/disabling automatic mic gain, digital output,
joystick/game ports, some future MIDI routing options,
etc).</p>
