<p>NAME mem, kmem, port - system memory, kernel memory and
system ports</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION mem is a character device file that is an
image of the main memory of the computer. It may be used,
for example, to examine (and even patch) the system.</p>

<p>Byte addresses in mem are interpreted as physical memory
addresses. References to nonexistent locations cause errors
to be returned.</p>

<p>Examining and patching is likely to lead to unexpected
results when read-only or write-only bits are present.</p>

<p>It is typically created by:</p>

<p>mknod -m 660 /dev/mem c 1 1 chown root:kmem /dev/mem</p>

<p>The file kmem is the same as mem, except that the kernel
virtual memory rather than physical memory is accessed.</p>

<p>It is typically created by:</p>

<p>mknod -m 640 /dev/kmem c 1 2 chown root:kmem
/dev/kmem</p>

<p>port is similar to mem, but the I/O ports are
accessed.</p>

<p>It is typically created by:</p>

<p>mknod -m 660 /dev/port c 1 4 chown root:mem
/dev/port</p>

<p>FILES /dev/mem /dev/kmem /dev/port</p>
