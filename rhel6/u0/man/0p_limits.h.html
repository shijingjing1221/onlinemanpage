<p>NAME limits.h - implementation-defined constants</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;limits.h&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Some of the functionality described on this
reference page extends the ISO C standard. Applications
shall define the appropriate feature test macro (see the
System Interfaces volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Sec- tion
2.2, The Compilation Environment) to enable the visibility
of these symbols in this header.</p>

<p>Many of the symbols listed here are not defined by the
ISO/IEC 9899:1999 standard. Such symbols are not shown as CX
shaded.</p>

<p>The &lt;limits.h&gt; header shall define various
symbolic names. Different categories of names are described
below.</p>

<p>The names represent various limits on resources that the
implementation imposes on applications.</p>

<p>Implementations may choose any appropriate value for
each limit, pro- vided it is not more restrictive than the
Minimum Acceptable Values listed below. Symbolic constant
names beginning with _POSIX may be found in &lt;unistd.h&gt;
.</p>

<p>Applications should not assume any particular value for
a limit. To achieve maximum portability, an application
should not require more resource than the Minimum Acceptable
Value quantity. However, an application wishing to avail
itself of the full amount of a resource available on an
implementation may make use of the value given in &lt;lim-
its.h&gt; on that particular implementation, by using the
symbolic names listed below. It should be noted, however,
that many of the listed lim- its are not invariant, and at
runtime, the value of the limit may dif- fer from those
given in this header, for the following reasons:</p>

<p>* The limit is pathname-dependent.</p>

<p>* The limit differs between the compile and runtime
machines.</p>

<p>For these reasons, an application may use the
fpathconf(), pathconf(), and sysconf() functions to
determine the actual value of a limit at runtime.</p>

<p>The items in the list ending in _MIN give the most
negative values that the mathematical types are guaranteed
to be capable of representing. Numbers of a more negative
value may be supported on some implementa- tions, as
indicated by the &lt;limits.h&gt; header on the
implementation, but applications requiring such numbers are
not guaranteed to be portable to all implementations. For
positive constants ending in _MIN, this indicates the
minimum acceptable value.</p>

<p>Runtime Invariant Values (Possibly Indeterminate) A
definition of one of the symbolic names in the following
list shall be omitted from &lt;limits.h&gt; on specific
implementations where the corre- sponding value is equal to
or greater than the stated minimum, but is unspecified.</p>

<p>This indetermination might depend on the amount of
available memory space on a specific instance of a specific
implementation. The actual value supported by a specific
instance shall be provided by the sysconf() function.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE A request was made to reduce the value of
{_POSIX_LINK_MAX} from the value of 8 specified for it in
the POSIX.1-1990 standard to 2. The standard developers
decided to deny this request for several reasons:</p>

<p>* They wanted to avoid making any changes to the
standard that could break conforming applications, and the
requested change could have that effect.</p>

<p>* The use of multiple hard links to a file cannot always
be replaced with use of symbolic links. Symbolic links are
semantically differ- ent from hard links in that they
associate a pathname with another pathname rather than a
pathname with a file. This has implications for access
control, file permanence, and transparency.</p>

<p>* The original standard developers had considered the
issue of allow- ing for implementations that did not in
general support hard links, and decided that this would
reduce consensus on the standard.</p>

<p>Systems that support historical versions of the
development option of the ISO POSIX-2 standard retain the
name {_POSIX2_RE_DUP_MAX} as an alias for
{_POSIX_RE_DUP_MAX}.</p>

<p>{PATH_MAX} IEEE PASC Interpretation 1003.1 #15 addressed
the inconsistency in the standard with the definition of
pathname and the descrip- tion of {PATH_MAX}, allowing
application writers to allocate either {PATH_MAX} or
{PATH_MAX}+1 bytes. The inconsistency has been removed by
correction to the {PATH_MAX} definition to include the null
character. With this change, applications that previously
allocated {PATH_MAX} bytes will continue to succeed.</p>

<p>{SYMLINK_MAX} This symbol refers to space for data that
is stored in the file system, as opposed to {PATH_MAX} which
is the length of a name that can be passed to a function. In
some existing implementa- tions, the filenames pointed to by
symbolic links are stored in the inodes of the links, so it
is important that {SYMLINK_MAX} not be constrained to be as
large as {PATH_MAX}.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
