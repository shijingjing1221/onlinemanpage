<p>DESCRIPTION These routines manipulate the current
attributes of the named window. The current attributes of a
window apply to all characters that are written into the
window with waddch, waddstr and wprintw. Attributes are a
property of the character, and move with the character
through any scrolling and insert/delete line/character
operations. To the ex- tent possible, they are displayed as
appropriate modifications to the graphic rendition of
characters put on the screen.</p>

<p>The routine attrset sets the current attributes of the
given window to attrs. The routine attroff turns off the
named attributes without turning any other attributes on or
off. The routine attron turns on the named attributes
without affecting any others. The routine stand- out is the
same as attron(A_STANDOUT). The routine standend is the same
as attrset(A_NORMAL) or attrset(0), that is, it turns off
all at- tributes.</p>

<p>The attrset and related routines do not affect the
attributes used when erasing portions of the window. See
curs_bkgd(3X) for functions which modify the attributes used
for erasing and clearing.</p>

<p>The routine color_set sets the current color of the
given window to the foreground/background combination
described by the color_pair_number. The parameter opts is
reserved for future use, applications must supply a null
pointer.</p>

<p>The routine wattr_get returns the current attribute and
color pair for the given window; attr_get returns the
current attribute and color pair for stdscr. The remaining
attr_* functions operate exactly like the corresponding
attr* functions, except that they take arguments of type
attr_t rather than int.</p>

<p>The routine chgat changes the attributes of a given
number of charac- ters starting at the current cursor
location of stdscr. It does not update the cursor and does
not perform wrapping. A character count of -1 or greater
than the remaining window width means to change at- tributes
all the way to the end of the current line. The wchgat func-
tion generalizes this to any window; the mvwchgat function
does a cur- sor move before acting. In these functions, the
color argument is a color-pair index (as in the first
argument of init_pair, see curs_col- or(3X)). The opts
argument is not presently used, but is reserved for the
future (leave it NULL).</p>

<p>Attributes The following video attributes, defined in
&lt;curses.h&gt;, can be passed to the routines attron,
attroff, and attrset, or ORd with the characters passed to
addch.</p>

<p>A_NORMAL Normal display (no highlight) A_STANDOUT Best
highlighting mode of the terminal. A_UNDERLINE Underlining
A_REVERSE Reverse video A_BLINK Blinking A_DIM Half bright
A_BOLD Extra bright or bold A_PROTECT Protected mode A_INVIS
Invisible or blank mode A_ALTCHARSET Alternate character set
A_CHARTEXT Bit-mask to extract a character COLOR_PAIR(n)
Color-pair number n</p>

<p>The following macro is the reverse of COLOR_PAIR(n):</p>

<p>PAIR_NUMBER(attrs) Returns the pair number associated
with the COLOR_PAIR(n) attribute.</p>

<p>The return values of many of these routines are not
meaningful (they are implemented as macro-expanded
assignments and simply return their argument). The SVr4
manual page claims (falsely) that these routines always
return 1.</p>

<p>NOTES Note that attroff, wattroff, attron, wattron,
attrset, wattrset, standend and standout may be macros.</p>

<p>COLOR_PAIR values can only be ORd with attributes if the
pair number is less than 256. The alternate functions such
as color_set can pass a color pair value directly. However,
ncurses ABI 4 and 5 simply OR this value within the
alternate functions. You must use ncurses ABI 6 to support
more than 256 color pairs.</p>

<p>PORTABILITY These functions are supported in the XSI
Curses standard, Issue 4. The standard defined the dedicated
type for highlights, attr_t, which is not defined in SVr4
curses. The functions taking attr_t arguments are not
supported under SVr4.</p>

<p>The XSI Curses standard states that whether the
traditional functions attron/attroff/attrset can manipulate
attributes other than A_BLINK, A_BOLD, A_DIM, A_REVERSE,
A_STANDOUT, or A_UNDERLINE is &quot;unspecified&quot;. Under
this implementation as well as SVr4 curses, these functions
cor- rectly manipulate all other highlights (specifically,
A_ALTCHARSET, A_PROTECT, and A_INVIS).</p>

<p>XSI Curses added the new entry points, attr_get,
attr_on, attr_off, at- tr_set, wattr_on, wattr_off,
wattr_get, wattr_set. These are intended to work with a new
series of highlight macros prefixed with WA_.</p>

<p>Older versions of this library did not force an update
of the screen when changing the attributes. Use touchwin to
force the screen to match the updated attributes.</p>

<p>WA_NORMAL Normal display (no highlight) WA_STANDOUT Best
highlighting mode of the terminal. WA_UNDERLINE Underlining
WA_REVERSE Reverse video WA_BLINK Blinking WA_DIM Half
bright WA_BOLD Extra bright or bold WA_ALTCHARSET Alternate
character set</p>

<p>The XSI curses standard specifies that each pair of
corresponding A_ and WA_-using functions operates on the
same current-highlight informa- tion.</p>

<p>The XSI standard extended conformance level adds new
highlights A_HORI- ZONTAL, A_LEFT, A_LOW, A_RIGHT, A_TOP,
A_VERTICAL (and corresponding WA_ macros for each) which
this implementation does not yet support.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE All routines return the integer OK on
success, or ERR on failure.</p>

<p>X/Open does not define any error conditions.</p>

<p>This implementation returns an error if the window
pointer is null. The wcolor_set function returns an error if
the color pair parameter is outside the range
0..COLOR_PAIRS-1. This implementation also provides getattrs
for compatibility with older versions of curses.</p>
