<p>NAME mtx - control SCSI media changer devices</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS mtx [-f &lt;scsi-generic-device&gt;]
[nobarcode] [invert] [noattach] command [ command ... ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The mtx command controls single or
multi-drive SCSI media changers such as tape changers,
autoloaders, tape libraries, or optical media juke- boxes.
It can also be used with media changers that use the
ATTACHED API, presuming that they properly report the
MChanger bit as required by the SCSI T-10 SMC
specification.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The first argument, given following -f , is the
SCSI generic device corresponding to your media changer.
Consult your operating systems documentation for more
information (for example, under Linux these are generally
/dev/sg0 through /dev/sg15, under FreeBSD these are
/dev/pass0 through /dev/passX, under SunOS it may be a file
under /dev/rdsk).</p>

<p>The invert option will invert (flip) the media (for
optical jukeboxes that allow such) before inserting it into
the drive or returning it to the storage slot.</p>

<p>The noattach option forces the regular media changer API
even if the media changer incorrectly reported that it uses
the ATTACHED API.</p>

<p>The nobarcode option forces the loader to not request
barcodes even if the loader is capable of reporting
them.</p>

<p>Following these options there may follow one or more
robotics control commands. Note that the invert and noattach
options apply to ALL of robotics control commands.</p>

<p>COMMANDS --version Report the mtx version number (e.g.
mtx 1.2.8) and exit.</p>

<p>inquiry Report the product type (Medium Changer, Tape
Drive, etc.), Vendor ID, Product ID, Revision, and whether
this uses the Attached Changer API (some tape drives use
this rather than reporting a Medium Changer on a separate
LUN or SCSI address).</p>

<p>noattach Make further commands use the regular media
changer API rather than the _ATTACHED API, no matter what
the &quot;Attached&quot; bit said in the Inquiry info.
Needed with some brain-dead changers that report Attached
bit but dont respond to _ATTACHED API.</p>

<p>inventory Makes the robot arm go and check what elements
are in the slots. This is needed for a few libraries like
the Breece Hill ones that do not automatically check the
tape inventory at system startup.</p>

<p>status Reports how many drives and storage elements are
contained in the device. For each drive, reports whether it
has media loaded in it, and if so, from which storage slot
the media originated. For each storage slot, reports whether
it is empty or full, and if the media changer has a bar
code, MIC reader, or some other way of uniquely identifying
media with- out loading it into a drive, this reports the
volume tag and/or alternate volume tag for each piece of
media. For historical reasons drives are numbered from 0 and
storage slots are numbered from 1.</p>

<p>load &lt;slotnum&gt; [ &lt;drivenum&gt; ] Load media
from slot &lt;slotnum&gt; into drive &lt;drivenum&gt;. Drive
0 is assumed if the drive number is omitted.</p>

<p>unload [&lt;slotnum&gt;] [ &lt;drivenum&gt; ] Unloads
media from drive &lt;drivenum&gt; into slot &lt;slotnum&gt;.
If &lt;drivenum&gt; is omitted, defaults to drive 0 (as do
all com- mands). If &lt;slotnum&gt; is omitted, defaults to
the slot that the drive was loaded from. Note that there s
currently no way to say unload drive 1s media to the slot it
came from, other than to explicitly use that slot number as
the destina- tion.</p>

<p>[eepos &lt;operation&gt;] transfer &lt;slotnum&gt;
&lt;slotnum&gt; Transfers media from one slot to another,
assuming that your mechanism is capable of doing so. Usually
used to move media to/from an import/export port. eepos is
used to extend/retract the import/export tray on certain
mid-range to high end tape libraries (if, e.g., the tray was
slot 32, you might say say eepos 1 transfer 32 32 to extend
the tray). Valid values for eepos &lt;operation&gt; are 0
(do nothing to the import/export tray), 1, and 2 (what 1 and
2 do varies depend- ing upon the library, consult your
librarys SCSI-level docu- mentation).</p>

<p>[eepos &lt;operation&gt;] [invert] [invert2] exchange
&lt;slotnum&gt; &lt;slotnum&gt; [&lt;slotnum&gt;] Move
medium from the first slot to the second slot, placing the
medium currently in the second slot either back into the
first slot or into the optional third slot.</p>

<p>first [&lt;drivenum&gt;] Loads drive &lt;drivenum&gt;
from the first slot in the media changer. Unloads the drive
if there is already media in it (note: you may need to eject
the tape using your OSs tape control commands first). Note
that this command may not be what you want on large tape
libraries -- e.g. on Exabyte 220, the first slot is usually
a cleaning tape. If &lt;drivenum&gt; is omitted, defaults to
first drive.</p>

<p>last [&lt;drivenum&gt;] Loads drive &lt;drivenum&gt;
from the last slot in the media changer. Unloads the drive
if there is already a tape in it. (Note: you may need to
eject the tape using your OSs tape control commands
first).</p>

<p>next [&lt;drivenum&gt;] Unloads the drive and loads the
next tape in sequence. If the drive was empty, loads the
first tape into the drive.</p>

<p>position &lt;slotnum&gt; Positions the robot at a
specific slot. Needed by some chang- ers to move to and open
the import/export, or mailbox, slot.</p>

<p>AUTHORS The original mtx program was written by Leonard
Zubkoff and exten- sively revised for large multi-drive
libraries with bar code readers by Eric Lee Green
&lt;eric@badtux.org&gt;. See mtx.c for other
contributors.</p>

<p>BUGS AND LIMITATIONS You may need to do a mt offline on
the tape drive to eject the tape before you can issue the
mtx unload command. The Exabyte EZ-17 and 220 in particular
will happily sit there snapping the robot arms claws around
thin air trying to grab a tape thats not there.</p>

<p>For some Linux distributions, you may need to re-compile
the kernel to scan SCSI LUN s in order to detect the media
changer. Check /proc/scsi/scsi to see whats going on.</p>

<p>If you try to unload a tape to its source slot, and said
slot is full, it will instead put the tape into the first
empty slot. Unfortu- nately the list of empty slots is not
updated between commands on the command line, so if you try
to unload another drive to a full source slot during the
same invocation of mtx, it will try to unload to the same
(no longer empty) slot and will urp with a SCSI error.</p>

<p>This program reads the Mode Sense Element Address
Assignment Page (SCSI) and requests data on all available
elements. For larger libraries (more than a couple dozen
elements) this sets a big Alloca- tion_Size in the SCSI
command block for the REQUEST_ELEMENT_STATUS com- mand in
order to be able to read the entire result of a big tape
library. Some operating systems may not be able to handle
this. Ver- sions of Linux earlier than 2.2.6, in particular,
may fail this request due to inability to find contiguous
pages of memory for the SCSI trans- fer (later versions of
Linux sg device do scatter-gather so that this should no
longer be a problem).</p>

<p>The eepos command remains in effect for all further
commands on a com- mand line. Thus you might want to follow
eepos 1 transfer 32 32 with eepos 0 as the next command
(which clears the eepos bits).</p>

<p>Need a better name for eepos command! (eepos is the name
of the bit field in the actual low-level SCSI command, and
has nothing to do with what it does).</p>

<p>This program has only been tested on Linux with a
limited number of tape loaders (a dual-drive Exabyte 220
tape library, with bar-code reader and 21 slots, an Exabyte
EZ-17 7-slot autoloader, and a Seagate DDS-4 autochanger
with 6 slots). It may not work on other operating systems
with larger libraries, due to the big SCSI request size.

<p>HINTS Under Linux, cat /proc/scsi/scsi will tell you
what SCSI devices you have. You can then refer to them as
/dev/sga, /dev/sgb, etc. by the order they are reported.</p>

<p>Under FreeBSD, camcontrol devlist will tell you what
SCSI devices you have, along with which pass device controls
them.</p>

<p>Under Solaris, set up your sgen driver so that itll look
for tape changers (see /kernel/drv/sgen.conf and the sgen
man page), type touch /reconfigure then reboot. You can find
your changer in /devices by typ- ing /usr/sbin/devfsadm -C
to clean out no-longer-extant entries in your /devices
directory, then find /devices -namchanger -print to find the
device name. Set the symbolic link /dev/changer to point to
that device name (if it is not doing so already).</p>

<p>With BRU, set your mount and unmount commands as
described on the BRU web site at http://www.bru.com to move
to the next tape when backing up or restoring. With GNU tar,
see mtx.doc for an example of how to use tar and mtx to make
multi-tape backups.</p>

<p>AVAILABILITY This version of mtx is currently being
maintained by Robert Nelson
&lt;robertnelson@users.sourceforge.net&gt; . The mtx home
page is http://mtx.sourceforge.net and the actual code is
currently available there and via SVN from
http://sourceforge.net/projects/mtx.</p>
