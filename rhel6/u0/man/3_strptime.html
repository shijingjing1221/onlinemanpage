<p>STRPTIME(3) Linux Programmer s Manual STRPTIME(3)</p>

<p>NAME strptime - convert a string representation of time
to a time tm struc- ture</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #define _XOPEN_SOURCE /* glibc2 needs this */
#include &lt;time.h&gt;</p>

<p>char *strptime(const char *s, const char *format, struct
tm *tm);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The strptime() function is the converse
function to strftime(3) and converts the character string
pointed to by s to values which are stored in the tm
structure pointed to by tm, using the format specified by
format. Here format is a character string that consists of
field descriptors and text characters, reminiscent of
scanf(3). Each field descriptor consists of a % character
followed by another character that specifies the replacement
for the field descriptor. All other charac- ters in the
format string must have a matching character in the input
string, except for whitespace, which matches zero or more
whitespace characters in the input string. There should be
whitespace or other alphanumeric characters between any two
field descriptors.</p>

<p>The strptime() function processes the input string from
left to right. Each of the three possible input elements
(whitespace, literal, or for- mat) are handled one after the
other. If the input cannot be matched to the format string
the function stops. The remainder of the format and input
strings are not processed.</p>

<p>The supported input field descriptors are listed below.
In case a text string (such as a weekday or month name) is
to be matched, the compari- son is case insensitive. In case
a number is to be matched, leading zeros are permitted but
not required.</p>

<p>%% The % character.</p>

<p>%a or %A The weekday name according to the current
locale, in abbreviated form or the full name.</p>

<p>%b or %B or %h The month name according to the current
locale, in abbreviated form or the full name.</p>

<p>%c The date and time representation for the current
locale.</p>

<p>%C The century number (0-99).</p>

<p>%d or %e The day of month (1-31).</p>

<p>%D Equivalent to %m/%d/%y. (This is the American style
date, very confusing to non-Americans, especially since
%d/%m/%y is widely used in Europe. The ISO 8601 standard
format is %Y-%m-%d.)</p>

<p>%H The hour (0-23).</p>

<p>%I The hour on a 12-hour clock (1-12).</p>

<p>%j The day number in the year (1-366).</p>

<p>%m The month number (1-12).</p>

<p>%M The minute (0-59).</p>

<p>%n Arbitrary whitespace.</p>

<p>%p The locales equivalent of AM or PM. (Note: there may
be none.)</p>

<p>%r The 12-hour clock time (using the locales AM or PM).
In the POSIX locale equivalent to %I:%M:%S %p. If t_fmt_ampm
is empty in the LC_TIME part of the current locale then the
behavior is undefined.</p>

<p>%R Equivalent to %H:%M.</p>

<p>%S The second (0-60; 60 may occur for leap seconds;
earlier also 61 was allowed).</p>

<p>%t Arbitrary whitespace.</p>

<p>%T Equivalent to %H:%M:%S.</p>

<p>%U The week number with Sunday the first day of the week
(0-53). The first Sunday of January is the first day of week
1.</p>

<p>%w The weekday number (0-6) with Sunday = 0.</p>

<p>%W The week number with Monday the first day of the week
(0-53). The first Monday of January is the first day of week
1.</p>

<p>%x The date, using the locales date format.</p>

<p>%X The time, using the locales time format.</p>

<p>%y The year within century (0-99). When a century is not
otherwise specified, values in the range 69-99 refer to
years in the twen- tieth century (1969-1999); values in the
range 00-68 refer to years in the twenty-first century
(2000-2068).</p>

<p>%Y The year, including century (for example, 1991).</p>

<p>Some field descriptors can be modified by the E or O
modifier charac- ters to indicate that an alternative format
or specification should be used. If the alternative format
or specification does not exist in the current locale, the
unmodified field descriptor is used.</p>

<p>The E modifier specifies that the input string may
contain alternative locale-dependent versions of the date
and time representation:</p>

<p>%Ec The locale s alternative date and time
representation.</p>

<p>%EC The name of the base year (period) in the locales
alternative representation.</p>

<p>%Ex The locales alternative date representation.</p>

<p>%EX The locales alternative time representation.</p>

<p>%Ey The offset from %EC (year only) in the locales
alternative rep- resentation.</p>

<p>%EY The full alternative year representation.</p>

<p>The O modifier specifies that the numerical input may be
in an alterna- tive locale-dependent format:</p>

<p>%Od or %Oe The day of the month using the locales
alternative numeric sym- bols; leading zeros are permitted
but not required.</p>

<p>%OH The hour (24-hour clock) using the locale s
alternative numeric symbols.</p>

<p>%OI The hour (12-hour clock) using the locale s
alternative numeric symbols.</p>

<p>%Om The month using the locales alternative numeric
symbols.</p>

<p>%OM The minutes using the locales alternative numeric
symbols.</p>

<p>%OS The seconds using the locales alternative numeric
symbols.</p>

<p>%OU The week number of the year (Sunday as the first day
of the week) using the locale s alternative numeric
symbols.</p>

<p>%Ow The number of the weekday (Sunday=0) using the
locales alterna- tive numeric symbols.</p>

<p>%OW The week number of the year (Monday as the first day
of the week) using the locale s alternative numeric
symbols.</p>

<p>%Oy The year (offset from %C) using the locales
alternative numeric symbols.</p>

<p>The broken-down time structure tm is defined in
&lt;time.h&gt; as follows:</p>

<p>struct tm { int tm_sec; /* seconds */ int tm_min; /*
minutes */ int tm_hour; /* hours */ int tm_mday; /* day of
the month */ int tm_mon; /* month */ int tm_year; /* year */
int tm_wday; /* day of the week */ int tm_yday; /* day in
the year */ int tm_isdst; /* daylight saving time */ };</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The return value of the function is a
pointer to the first character not processed in this
function call. In case the input string contains more
characters than required by the format string the return
value points right after the last consumed input character.
In case the whole input string is consumed the return value
points to the null byte at the end of the string. If
strptime() fails to match all of the for- mat string and
therefore an error occurred the function returns NULL.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO SUSv2, POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>NOTES In principle, this function does not initialize tm
but only stores the values specified. This means that tm
should be initialized before the call. Details differ a bit
between different Unix systems. The glibc implementation
does not touch those fields which are not explicitly
specified, except that it recomputes the tm_wday and tm_yday
field if any of the year, month, or day elements
changed.</p>

<p>This function is available since libc 4.6.8. Linux libc4
and libc5 includes define the prototype unconditionally;
glibc2 includes provide a prototype only when _XOPEN_SOURCE
or _GNU_SOURCE are defined.</p>

<p>Before libc 5.4.13 whitespace (and the &rsquo;n&rsquo;
and &rsquo;t&rsquo; specifications) was not handled, no
&rsquo;E&rsquo; and &rsquo;O&rsquo; locale modifier
characters were accepted, and the &rsquo;C&rsquo;
specification was a synonym for the &rsquo;c&rsquo;
specification.</p>

<p>The &rsquo;y&rsquo; (year in century) specification is
taken to specify a year in the 20th century by libc4 and
libc5. It is taken to be a year in the range 1950-2049 by
glibc 2.0. It is taken to be a year in 1969-2068 since glibc
2.1.</p>

<p>Glibc Notes For reasons of symmetry, glibc tries to
support for strptime() the same format characters as for
strftime(3). (In most cases the corresponding fields are
parsed, but no field in tm is changed.) This leads to</p>

<p>%F Equivalent to %Y-%m-%d, the ISO 8601 date format.</p>

<p>%g The year corresponding to the ISO week number, but
without the century (0-99).</p>

<p>%G The year corresponding to the ISO week number. (For
example, 1991.)</p>

<p>%u The day of the week as a decimal number (1-7, where
Monday = 1).</p>

<p>%V The ISO 8601:1988 week number as a decimal number
(1-53). If the week (starting on Monday) containing 1
January has four or more days in the new year, then it is
considered week 1. Other- wise, it is the last week of the
previous year, and the next week is week 1.</p>

<p>%z An RFC-822/ISO 8601 standard timezone
specification.</p>

<p>%Z The timezone name.</p>

<p>Similarly, because of GNU extensions to strftime(3), %k
is accepted as a synonym for %H, and %l should be accepted
as a synonym for %I, and %P is accepted as a synonym for %p.
Finally</p>

<p>%s The number of seconds since the Epoch, that is, since
1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC. Leap seconds are not counted unless
leap second support is available.</p>

<p>The glibc implementation does not require whitespace
between two field descriptors.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE The following example demonstrates the use of
strptime() and strf- time(3).</p>

<p>#define _XOPEN_SOURCE #include &lt;stdio.h&gt; #include
&lt;stdlib.h&gt; #include &lt;time.h&gt;</p>

<p>int main(void) { struct tm tm; char buf[255];</p>

<p>strptime(&quot;2001-11-12 18:31:01&quot;, &quot;%Y-%m-%d
%H:%M:%S&quot;, &amp;tm); strftime(buf, sizeof(buf),
&quot;%d %b %Y %H:%M&quot;, &amp;tm); puts(buf);
exit(EXIT_SUCCESS); }</p>
