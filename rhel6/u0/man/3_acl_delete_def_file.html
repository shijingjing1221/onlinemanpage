<p>ACL_DELETE_DEF_FILE(3) BSD Library Functions Manual
ACL_DELETE_DEF_FILE(3)</p>

<p>NAME acl_delete_def_file - delete a default ACL by
filename</p>

<p>LIBRARY Linux Access Control Lists library (libacl,
-lacl).</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; #include
&lt;sys/acl.h&gt;</p>

<p>int acl_delete_def_file(const char *path_p);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The acl_delete_def_file() function deletes a
default ACL from the direc- tory whose pathname is pointed
to by the argument path_p.</p>

<p>The effective user ID of the process must match the
owner of the file or directory or the process must have the
CAP_FOWNER capability for the request to succeed.</p>

<p>If the argument path_p is not a directory, then the
function fails. It is no error if the directory whose
pathname is pointed to by the argument path_p does not have
a default ACL.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The acl_delete_def_file() function returns
the value 0 if successful; otherwise the value -1 is
returned and the global variable errno is set to indicate
the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS If any of the following conditions occur, the
acl_delete_def_file() func- tion returns the value -1 and
and sets errno to the corresponding value:</p>

<p>[EINVAL] The file referred to by path_p is not a
directory.</p>

<p>[ENOTSUP] The file system on which the file identified
by path_p is located does not support ACLs, or ACLs are dis-
abled.</p>

<p>[EPERM] The process does not have appropriate privilege
to perform the operation to delete the default ACL.</p>

<p>[EROFS] This function requires modification of a file
system which is currently read-only.</p>

<p>STANDARDS IEEE Std 1003.1e draft 17 (POSIX.1e,
abandoned)</p>
