SDL_JoyBallEvent(3)</p>

<p>NAME SDL_JoyBallEvent - Joystick trackball motion event
structure</p>

<p>STRUCTURE DEFINITION typedef struct{ Uint8 type; Uint8
which; Uint8 ball; Sint16 xrel, yrel; }
SDL_JoyBallEvent;</p>

<p>STRUCTURE DATA type SDL_JOYBALLMOTION</p>

<p>which Joystick device index</p>

<p>ball Joystick trackball index</p>

<p>xrel, yrel The relative motion in the X/Y direction</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION SDL_JoyBallEvent is a member of the
SDL_Event union and is used when an event of type
SDL_JOYBALLMOTION is reported.</p>

<p>A SDL_JOYBALLMOTION event occurs when a user moves a
trackball on the joystick. The field which is the index of
the joystick that reported the event and ball is the index
of the trackball (for a more detailed explaination see the
Joystick section). Trackballs only return relative motion,
this is the change in position on the ball since it was last
polled (last cycle of the event loop) and it is stored in
xrel and yrel.</p>
