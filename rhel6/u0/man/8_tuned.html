<p>tuned(8) Adaptive system tuning daemon tuned(8)</p>

<p>NAME tuned - dynamic adaptive system tuning daemon</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS tuned [options]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION tuned is a dynamic adaptive system tuning
daemon that tunes system set- tings dynamically depending on
usage. For each hardware subsystem a specific monitoring
plugin collects data periodically. This information is then
used by tuning plugins to change system settings to lower or
higher power saving modes in order to adapt to the current
usage. Cur- rently monitoring and tuning plugins for CPU,
ethernet network and ATA harddisk devices are
implemented.</p>

<p>In order to make it easier to switch between settings
for different setups or locations we now have an additional
tool to switch between profiles. Several pre defined
profiles have already been included, but new ones can easily
be added or existing ones modified. For more details look at
tuned-adm(1).</p>

<p>OPTIONS -d, --daemon This options starts tuned as a
daemon as opposed to in the foreground without forking at
startup.</p>

<p>-c, --conffile=&quot;conffile&quot; Specify the name and
path of the configuration file, default is
/etc/tuned.conf.</p>

<p>-D, --debug Sets the highest logging level. This could
be very useful when having trouble with tuned.</p>
