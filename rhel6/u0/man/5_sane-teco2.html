<p>sane-teco2(5) SANE Scanner Access Now Easy
sane-teco2(5)</p>

<p>NAME sane-teco2 - SANE backend for TECO / RELISYS
scanners</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sane-teco2 library implements a SANE
(Scanner Access Now Easy) backend that provides access to
some TECO SCSI flatbed scanners. This backend should be
considered beta-quality software! TECO scanners are sold
under various brands like Mustek, Relisys, Piotech, Primax,
TRUST. This backend may or may not support yours.</p>

<p>The scanners that should work with this backend are:</p>

<p>Vendor Model TECO model status ----------------------
-------------- ----------- Mustek ScanMagic 4830S VM3575
untested Primax Jewel 4800 VM356A good Primax Profi 9600
VM6575 basic Primax Profi 19200 VM6586 good Relisys APOLLO
Express 3 VM356A basic Relisys APOLLO Express 6 VM6565 good
Relisys APOLLO Express 12 ? untested Relisys AVEC II S3
VM3564 good Relisys AVEC Super 3 VM3575 basic Relisys
SCORPIO Pro VM6575 good Relisys SCORPIO Pro-S VM6586
untested Relisys SCORPIO Super 3 VM3575 good</p>

<p>For all these scanners, lineart and gray mode work well.
However, most of them do not support more than a handful of
resolutions in color mode. See the backend home page (under
AUTHOR) for the exact status of each scanner.</p>

<p>Note that the untested scanner will not be directly
supported. You should contact the author for that.</p>

<p>The TECO VM number can usually be found at the back of
the scanner. It is also part of the FCC ID.</p>

<p>The options the backend supports can either be selected
through command line options to programs like scanimage or
through GUI elements in xscanimage, xsane, quiteinsane or
kooka.</p>

<p>If you have any success with a scanner not listed here,
or if you have any strange behavior, please report to the
backend maintainer or to the SANE mailing list.</p>

<p>Valid command line options and their syntax can be
listed by using scanimage --help -d teco2</p>

<p>Scan Mode</p>

<p>--mode selects the basic mode of operation of the
scanner valid choices are Lineart , Gray and Color The
Lineart mode is black and white only (1 bit). Gray mode will
produce 256 levels of gray (8 bits). Color will produce a 24
bits color image.</p>

<p>--resolution Lineart and Gray selects the resolution for
a scan. The scanner can do all resolutions between 1 and
600, in increments of 1.</p>

<p>Color selects the resolution for a scan. The scanner can
do only the resolutions listed.</p>

<p>All values with ydpi &gt; 300 (300 x 600) or 600 (600 x
1200) result in a wrong proportion for the scan. The
proportion can be adjusted with the following imagemagick
command: convert -geome- try (dpi/max_xdpi * 100%)x100%
max_xdpi is for the vm3575 con- stant with 300 dpi e.g.
600dpi adjust with: convert -geometry 200%x100%</p>

<p>Geometry options</p>

<p>-l -t -x -y control the scan area: -l sets the top left
x coordinate, -t the top left y coordinate, -x selects the
width and -y the height of the scan area. All parameters are
specified in millimeters by default.</p>

<p>Enhancement options</p>

<p>--custom-gamma (no custom gamma option for the VM3564
and VM356A) (color mode only) allows the user to specify a
gamma table (see the next 3 parameters).</p>

<p>--red-gamma-table (color mode only) can be used to
download a user defined gamma table for the red channel. The
table must be 256 bytes long.</p>

<p>--green-gamma-table (color mode only) can be used to
download a user defined gamma table for the green channel.
The table must be 256 bytes long.</p>

<p>--blue-gamma-table (color mode only) can be used to
download a user defined gamma table for the blue channel.
The table must be 256 bytes long.</p>

<p>--white-level-r (VM3564, VM356A, VM3575 and VM6575 only)
Selects what red radi- ance level should be considered
&quot;white&quot;, when scanning some sheets by changing the
calibration value loaded into the scan- ner. Scale 0..64 in
steps of 1.</p>

<p>--white-level-g (VM3564, VM356A, VM3575 and VM6575 only)
Selects what green radiance level should be considered
&quot;white&quot;, when scanning some sheets by changing the
calibration i value loaded into the scan- ner. Scale 0..64
in steps of 1.</p>

<p>--white-level-b (VM3564, VM356A, VM3575 and VM6575 only)
Selects what blue radi- ance level should be considered
&quot;white&quot;, when scanning some sheets by changing the
calibration value loaded into the scan- ner. Scale 0..64 in
steps of 1.</p>

<p>--preview requests a preview scan. The resolution used
for that scan is 50 dpi (for VM356A and VM6575 75 dpi) and
the scan area is the max- imum allowed. The scan mode is
user selected. The default is &quot;no&quot;.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION FILE The configuration file
/etc/sane.d/teco2.conf supports only one infor- mation: the
device name to use (eg /dev/scanner).</p>

<p>FILES /usr/lib64/sane/libsane-teco2.a The static library
implementing this backend.</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-teco2.so The shared library
implementing this backend (present on systems that support
dynamic loading).</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT SANE_DEBUG_TECO2 If the library was compiled
with debug support enabled, this environment variable
controls the debug level for this backend. E.g., a value of
128 requests all debug output to be printed. Smaller levels
reduce verbosity.</p>

<p>SANE_TECO2_CAL_ALGO Either 0 or 1. Selects the algorithm
for the calibration. A value of 1 seems to give better scans
on the VM356A, VM3575. Feedback on it is welcome. For
VM3564, VM356A, VM3575, VM6575 default 1. For other
supported types default 0.</p>

<p>LIMITATIONS The windows TWAIN driver has many more
options than this SANE backend. However they are only
software adjustments. This backend only imple- ments what
the scanner can support.</p>

<p>BUGS Plenty. Parts of this backend are still under
development.</p>
