<p>DESCRIPTION Ipvsadm(8) is used to set up, maintain or
inspect the virtual server table in the Linux kernel. The
Linux Virtual Server can be used to build scalable network
services based on a cluster of two or more nodes. The active
node of the cluster redirects service requests to a
collection of server hosts that will actually perform the
services. Supported features include two protocols (TCP and
UDP), three packet- forwarding methods (NAT, tunneling, and
direct routing), and eight load balancing algorithms (round
robin, weighted round robin, least-connec- tion, weighted
least-connection, locality-based least-connection,
locality-based least-connection with replication,
destination-hashing, and source-hashing).</p>

<p>The command has two basic formats for execution:</p>

<p>ipvsadm COMMAND [protocol] service-address
[scheduling-method] [persistence options]</p>

<p>ipvsadm command [protocol] service-address
server-address [packet-forwarding-method] [weight
options]</p>

<p>The first format manipulates a virtual service and the
algorithm for assigning service requests to real servers.
Optionally, a persistent timeout and network mask for the
granularity of a persistent service may be specified. The
second format manipulates a real server that is associated
with an existing virtual service. When specifying a real
server, the packet-forwarding method and the weight of the
real server, relative to other real servers for the virtual
service, may be speci- fied, otherwise defaults will be
used.</p>

<p>COMMANDS ipvsadm(8) recognises the commands described
below. Upper-case commands maintain virtual services.
Lower-case commands maintain real servers that are
associated with a virtual service.</p>

<p>-A, --add-service Add a virtual service. A service
address is uniquely defined by a triplet: IP address, port
number, and protocol. Alternatively, a virtual service may
be defined by a firewall-mark.</p>

<p>-E, --edit-service Edit a virtual service.</p>

<p>-D, --delete-service Delete a virtual service, along
with any associated real servers.</p>

<p>-C, --clear Clear the virtual server table.</p>

<p>-R, --restore Restore Linux Virtual Server rules from
stdin. Each line read from stdin will be treated as the
command line options to a sep- arate invocation of ipvsadm.
Lines read from stdin can option- ally begin with
&quot;ipvsadm&quot;. This option is useful to avoid exe-
cuting a large number or ipvsadm commands when constructing
an extensive routing table.</p>

<p>-S, --save Dump the Linux Virtual Server rules to stdout
in a format that can be read by -R|--restore.</p>

<p>-a, --add-server Add a real server to a virtual
service.</p>

<p>-e, --edit-server Edit a real server in a virtual
service.</p>

<p>-d, --delete-server Remove a real server from a virtual
service.</p>

<p>-L, -l, --list List the virtual server table if no
argument is specified. If a service-address is selected,
list this service only. If the -c option is selected, then
display the connection table. The exact output is affected
by the other arguments given.</p>

<p>-Z, --zero Zero the packet, byte and rate counters in a
service or all ser- vices.</p>

<p>--set tcp tcpfin udp Change the timeout values used for
IPVS connections. This com- mand always takes 3 parameters,
representing the timeout values (in seconds) for TCP
sessions, TCP sessions after receiv- ing a FIN packet, and
UDP packets, respectively. A timeout value 0 means that the
current timeout value of the correspond- ing entry is
preserved.</p>

<p>--start-daemon state Start the connection
synchronization daemon. The state is to indicate that the
daemon is started as master or backup. The connection
synchronization daemon is implemented inside the Linux
kernel. The master daemon running at the primary load bal-
ancer multicasts changes of connections periodically, and
the backup daemon running at the backup load balancers
receives mul- ticast message and creates corresponding
connections. Then, in case the primary load balancer fails,
a backup load balancer will takeover, and it has state of
almost all connections, so that almost all established
connections can continue to access the service.</p>

<p>The sync daemon currently only supports IPv4
connections.</p>

<p>--stop-daemon Stop the connection synchronization
daemon.</p>

<p>-h, --help Display a description of the command
syntax.</p>

<p>PARAMETERS The commands above accept or require zero or
more of the following parameters.</p>

<p>-t, --tcp-service service-address Use TCP service. The
service-address is of the form host[:port]. Host may be one
of a plain IP address or a hostname. Port may be either a
plain port number or the service name of port. The Port may
be omitted, in which case zero will be used. A Port of zero
is only valid if the service is persistent as the
-p|--persis- tent option, in which case it is a wild-card
port, that is con- nections will be accepted to any
port.</p>

<p>-u, --udp-service service-address Use UDP service. See
the -t|--tcp-service for the description of the
service-address.</p>

<p>-f, --fwmark-service integer Use a firewall-mark, an
integer value greater than zero, to denote a virtual service
instead of an address, port and proto- col (UDP or TCP). The
marking of packets with a firewall-mark is configured using
the -m|--mark option to iptables(8). It can be used to build
a virtual service assoicated with the same real servers,
covering multiple IP address, port and protocol trip- plets.
If IPv6 addresses are used, the -6 option must be used.</p>

<p>Using firewall-mark virtual services provides a
convenient method of grouping together different IP
addresses, ports and protocols into a single virtual
service. This is useful for both simplifying configuration
if a large number of virtual services are required and
grouping persistence across what would other- wise be
multiple virtual services.</p>

<p>-s, --scheduler scheduling-method scheduling-method
Algorithm for allocating TCP connections and UDP datagrams
to real servers. Scheduling algorithms are imple- mented as
kernel modules. Ten are shipped with the Linux Virtual
Server:</p>

<p>rr - Robin Robin: distributes jobs equally amongst the
available real servers.</p>

<p>wrr - Weighted Round Robin: assigns jobs to real servers
propor- tionally to there real servers weight. Servers with
higher weights receive new jobs first and get more jobs than
servers with lower weights. Servers with equal weights get
an equal dis- tribution of new jobs.</p>

<p>lc - Least-Connection: assigns more jobs to real servers
with fewer active jobs.</p>

<p>wlc - Weighted Least-Connection: assigns more jobs to
servers with fewer jobs and relative to the real servers
weight (Ci/Wi). This is the default.</p>

<p>lblc - Locality-Based Least-Connection: assigns jobs
destined for the same IP address to the same server if the
server is not overloaded and available; otherwise assign
jobs to servers with fewer jobs, and keep it for future
assignment.</p>

<p>lblcr - Locality-Based Least-Connection with
Replication: assigns jobs destined for the same IP address
to the least-con- nection node in the server set for the IP
address. If all the node in the server set are over loaded,
it picks up a node with fewer jobs in the cluster and adds
it in the sever set for the target. If the server set has
not been modified for the speci- fied time, the most loaded
node is removed from the server set, in order to avoid high
degree of replication.</p>

<p>dh - Destination Hashing: assigns jobs to servers
through look- ing up a statically assigned hash table by
their destination IP addresses.</p>

<p>sh - Source Hashing: assigns jobs to servers through
looking up a statically assigned hash table by their source
IP addresses.</p>

<p>sed - Shortest Expected Delay: assigns an incoming job
to the server with the shortest expected delay. The expected
delay that the job will experience is (Ci + 1) / Ui if sent
to the ith server, in which Ci is the number of jobs on the
the ith server and Ui is the fixed service rate (weight) of
the ith server.</p>

<p>nq - Never Queue: assigns an incoming job to an idle
server if there is, instead of waiting for a fast one; if
all the servers are busy, it adopts the Shortest Expected
Delay policy to assign the job.</p>

<p>-p, --persistent [timeout] Specify that a virtual
service is persistent. If this option is specified, multiple
requests from a client are redirected to the same real
server selected for the first request. Optionally, the
timeout of persistent sessions may be specified given in
seconds, otherwise the default of 300 seconds will be used.
This option may be used in conjunction with protocols such
as SSL or FTP where it is important that clients
consistently connect with the same real server.</p>

<p>Note: If a virtual service is to handle FTP connections
then persistence must be set for the virtual service if
Direct Rout- ing or Tunnelling is used as the forwarding
mechanism. If Mas- querading is used in conjunction with an
FTP service than per- sistence is not necessary, but the
ip_vs_ftp kernel module must be used. This module may be
manually inserted into the kernel using insmod(8).</p>

<p>-M, --netmask netmask Specify the granularity with which
clients are grouped for per- sistent virtual services. The
source address of the request is masked with this netmask to
direct all clients from a network to the same real server.
The default is 255.255.255.255, that is, the persistence
granularity is per client host. Less specific netmasks may
be used to resolve problems with non-persistent cache
clusters on the client side. IPv6 netmasks should be
specified as a prefix length between 1 and 128. The default
prefix length is 128.</p>

<p>-r, --real-server server-address Real server that an
associated request for service may be assigned to. The
server-address is the host address of a real server, and may
plus port. Host can be either a plain IP address or a
hostname. Port can be either a plain port number or the
service name of port. In the case of the masquerading
method, the host address is usually an RFC 1918 private IP
address, and the port can be different from that of the
associated service. With the tunneling and direct routing
methods, port must be equal to that of the service address.
For normal services, the port specified in the service
address will be used if port is not specified. For fwmark
services, port may be omitted, in which case the destination
port on the real server will be the destination port of the
request sent to the virtual service.</p>

<p>[packet-forwarding-method]</p>

<p>-g, --gatewaying Use gatewaying (direct routing). This
is the default.</p>

<p>-i, --ipip Use ipip encapsulation (tunneling).</p>

<p>-m, --masquerading Use masquerading (network access
transla- tion, or NAT).</p>

<p>Note: Regardless of the packet-forwarding mechanism
specified, real servers for addresses for which there are
interfaces on the local node will be use the local
forwarding method, then packets for the servers will be
passed to upper layer on the local node. This cannot be
specified by ipvsadm, rather it set by the kernel as real
servers are added or modified.</p>

<p>-w, --weight weight Weight is an integer specifying the
capacity of a server rela- tive to the others in the pool.
The valid values of weight are 0 through to 65535. The
default is 1. Quiescent servers are speci- fied with a
weight of zero. A quiescent server will receive no new jobs
but still serve the existing jobs, for all scheduling
algorithms distributed with the Linux Virtual Server.
Setting a quiescent server may be useful if the server is
overloaded or needs to be taken out of service for
maintenance.</p>

<p>-x, --u-threshold uthreshold uthreshold is an integer
specifying the upper connection thresh- old of a server. The
valid values of uthreshold are 0 through to 65535. The
default is 0, which means the upper connection threshold is
not set. If uthreshold is set with other values, no new
connections will be sent to the server when the number of
its connections exceeds its upper connection threshold.</p>

<p>-y, --l-threshold lthreshold lthreshold is an integer
specifying the lower connection thresh- old of a server. The
valid values of lthreshold are 0 through to 65535. The
default is 0, which means the lower connection threshold is
not set. If lthreshold is set with other values, the server
will receive new connections when the number of its
connections drops below its lower connection threshold. If
lthreshold is not set but uthreshold is set, the server will
receive new connections when the number of its connections
drops below three forth of its upper connection
threshold.</p>

<p>--mcast-interface interface Specify the multicast
interface that the sync master daemon sends outgoing
multicasts through, or the sync backup daemon listens to for
multicasts.</p>

<p>--syncid syncid Specify the syncid that the sync master
daemon fills in the Syn- cID header while sending multicast
messages, or the sync backup daemon uses to filter out
multicast messages not matched with the SyncID value. The
valid values of syncid are 0 through to 255. The default is
0, which means no filtering at all.</p>

<p>-c, --connection Connection output. The list command
with this option will list current IPVS connections.</p>

<p>--timeout Timeout output. The list command with this
option will display the timeout values (in seconds) for TCP
sessions, TCP sessions after receiving a FIN packet, and UDP
packets.</p>

<p>--daemon Daemon information output. The list command
with this option will display the daemon status and its
multicast interface.</p>

<p>--stats Output of statistics information. The list
command with this option will display the statistics
information of services and their servers.</p>

<p>--rate Output of rate information. The list command with
this option will display the rate information (such as
connections/second, bytes/second and packets/second) of
services and their servers.</p>

<p>--thresholds Output of thresholds information. The list
command with this option will display the upper/lower
connection threshold infor- mation of each server in service
listing.</p>

<p>--persistent-conn Output of persistent connection
information. The list command with this option will display
the persistent connection counter information of each server
in service listing. The persistent connection is used to
forward the actual connections from the same client/network
to the same server.</p>

<p>--sort Sort the list of virtual services and real
servers. The virtual service entries are sorted in ascending
order by &lt;protocol, address, port&gt;. The real server
entries are sorted in ascending order by &lt;address,
port&gt;. (default)</p>

<p>--nosort Do not sort the list of virtual services and
real servers.</p>

<p>-O, --ops Specify that a virtual service uses one-packet
scheduling. This option can be used only for UDP services.
If this option is specified, all connections are created
only to schedule one packet. Option is useful to schedule
UDP packets from same client port to different real
servers.</p>

<p>-n, --numeric Numeric output. IP addresses and port
numbers will be printed in numeric format rather than as as
host names and services respectively, which is the
default.</p>

<p>--exact Expand numbers. Display the exact value of the
packet and byte counters, instead of only the rounded number
in K s (multiples of 1000) Ms (multiples of 1000K) or Gs
(multiples of 1000M). This option is only relevant for the
-L command.</p>

<p>-6 Use with -f to signify fwmark rule uses IPv6
addresses.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE 1 - Simple Virtual Service The following
commands configure a Linux Director to distribute incom- ing
requests addressed to port 80 on 207.175.44.110 equally to
port 80 on five real servers. The forwarding method used in
this example is NAT, with each of the real servers being
masqueraded by the Linux Director.</p>

<p>ipvsadm -A -t 207.175.44.110:80 -s rr ipvsadm -a -t
207.175.44.110:80 -r 192.168.10.1:80 -m ipvsadm -a -t
207.175.44.110:80 -r 192.168.10.2:80 -m ipvsadm -a -t
207.175.44.110:80 -r 192.168.10.3:80 -m ipvsadm -a -t
207.175.44.110:80 -r 192.168.10.4:80 -m ipvsadm -a -t
207.175.44.110:80 -r 192.168.10.5:80 -m</p>

<p>Alternatively, this could be achieved in a single
ipvsadm command.</p>

<p>echo &quot; -A -t 207.175.44.110:80 -s rr -a -t
207.175.44.110:80 -r 192.168.10.1:80 -m -a -t
207.175.44.110:80 -r 192.168.10.2:80 -m -a -t
207.175.44.110:80 -r 192.168.10.3:80 -m -a -t
207.175.44.110:80 -r 192.168.10.4:80 -m -a -t
207.175.44.110:80 -r 192.168.10.5:80 -m &quot; | ipvsadm
-R</p>

<p>As masquerading is used as the forwarding mechanism in
this example, the default route of the real servers must be
set to the linux direc- tor, which will need to be
configured to forward and masquerade pack- ets. This can be
achieved using the following commands:</p>

<p>echo &quot;1&quot; &gt;
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward</p>

<p>EXAMPLE 2 - Firewall-Mark Virtual Service The following
commands configure a Linux Director to distribute incom- ing
requests addressed to any port on 207.175.44.110 or
207.175.44.111 equally to the corresponding port on five
real servers. As per the pre- vious example, the forwarding
method used in this example is NAT, with each of the real
servers being masqueraded by the Linux Director.</p>

<p>ipvsadm -A -f 1 -s rr ipvsadm -a -f 1 -r 192.168.10.1:0
-m ipvsadm -a -f 1 -r 192.168.10.2:0 -m ipvsadm -a -f 1 -r
192.168.10.3:0 -m ipvsadm -a -f 1 -r 192.168.10.4:0 -m
ipvsadm -a -f 1 -r 192.168.10.5:0 -m</p>

<p>As masquerading is used as the forwarding mechanism in
this example, the default route of the real servers must be
set to the linux direc- tor, which will need to be
configured to forward and masquerade pack- ets. The real
server should also be configured to mark incoming packets
addressed to any port on 207.175.44.110 and 207.175.44.111
with fire- wall-mark 1. If FTP traffic is to be handled by
this virtual service, then the ip_vs_ftp kernel module needs
to be inserted into the kernel. These operations can be
achieved using the following commands:</p>

<p>echo &quot;1&quot; &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
modprobe ip_tables iptables -A PREROUTING -t mangle -d
207.175.44.110/31 -j MARK --set-mark 1 modprobe
ip_vs_ftp</p>

<p>IPv6 IPv6 addresses should be surrounded by square
brackets ([ and ]).</p>

<p>ipvsadm -A -t [2001:db8::80]:80 -s rr ipvsadm -a -t
[2001:db8::80]:80 -r [2001:db8::a0a0]:80 -m</p>

<p>fwmark IPv6 services require the -6 option.</p>

<p>NOTES The Linux Virtual Server implements three defense
strategies against some types of denial of service (DoS)
attacks. The Linux Director cre- ates an entry for each
connection in order to keep its state, and each entry
occupies 128 bytes effective memory. LVS s vulnerability to
a DoS attack lies in the potential to increase the number
entries as much as possible until the linux director runs
out of memory. The three defense strategies against the
attack are: Randomly drop some entries in the table. Drop
1/rate packets before forwarding them. And use secure tcp
state transition table and short timeouts. The strategies
are con- trolled by sysctl variables and corresponding
entries in the /proc filesystem:</p>

<p>/proc/sys/net/ipv4/vs/drop_entry
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/vs/drop_packet
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/vs/secure_tcp</p>

<p>Valid values for each variable are 0 through to 3. The
default value is 0, which disables the respective defense
strategy. 1 and 2 are auto- matic modes - when there is no
enough available memory, the respective strategy will be
enabled and the variable is automatically set to 2,
otherwise the strategy is disabled and the variable is set
to 1. A value of 3 denotes that the respective strategy is
always enabled. The available memory threshold and secure
TCP timeouts can be tuned using the sysctl variables and
corresponding entries in the /proc filesystem:</p>

<p>/proc/sys/net/ipv4/vs/amemthresh
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/vs/timeout_*</p>

<p>FILES /proc/net/ip_vs /proc/net/ip_vs_app
