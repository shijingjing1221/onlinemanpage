<p>NAME vfs_cacheprime - prime the kernel file data
cache</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS vfs objects = cacheprime</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This VFS module is part of the samba(7)
suite.</p>

<p>The vfs_cacheprime VFS module reads chunks of file data
near the range requested by clients in order to make sure
the data is present in the kernel file data cache at the
time when it is actually requested by clients.</p>

<p>The size of the disk read operations performed by
vfs_cacheprime is determined by the cacheprime:rsize option.
All disk read operations are aligned on boundaries that are
a multiple of this size. Each range of the file data is
primed at most once during the time the client has the file
open.</p>

<p>This module is stackable.</p>

<p>OPTIONS cacheprime:rsize = BYTES The number of bytes
with which to prime the kernel data cache.</p>

<p>The following suffixes may be applied to BYTES:</p>

<p>&middot; K - BYTES is a number of kilobytes</p>

<p>&middot; M - BYTES is a number of megabytes</p>

<p>&middot; G - BYTES is a number of gigabytes</p>

<p>EXAMPLES For a hypothetical disk array, it is necessary
to ensure that all read operations are of size 1 megabyte
(1048576 bytes), and aligned on 1 megabyte boundaries:</p>

<p>[hypothetical] vfs objects = cacheprime cacheprime:rsize
= 1M</p>

<p>CAVEATS cacheprime is not a a substitute for a
general-purpose readahead mechanism. It is intended for use
only in very specific environments where disk operations
must be aligned and sized to known values (as much as that
is possible).</p>

<p>VERSION This man page is correct for version 3.0.25 of
the Samba suite.</p>

<p>AUTHOR The original Samba software and related utilities
were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by
the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way
the Linux kernel is developed.</p>
