discard ] [ -i interface0 [ ... -i inter- faceN ] ] server0
[ ...serverN ]</p>

[ ... -l low- erN ] -u upper0 [ ... -u upperN ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The Internet Systems Consortium DHCP Relay
Agent, dhcrelay, provides a means for relaying DHCP and
BOOTP requests from a subnet to which no DHCP server is
directly connected to one or more DHCP servers on other
subnets. It supports both DHCPv4/BOOTP and DHCPv6
protocols.</p>

<p>OPERATION The DHCP Relay Agent listens for DHCPv4 or
DHCPv6 queries from clients or other relay agents on one or
more interfaces, passing them along to upstream servers or
relay agents as specified on the command line. When a reply
is received from upstream, it is multicast or unicast back
downstream to the source of the original request.</p>

<p>COMMAND LINE Protocol selection options:</p>

<p>-6 Run dhcrelay as a DHCPv6 relay agent. Incompatible
with the -4 option.</p>

<p>-4 Run dhcrelay as a DHCPv4/BOOTP relay agent. This is
the default mode of operation, so the argument is not
necessary, but may be specified for clarity. Incompatible
with -6.</p>

<p>Specifying DHCPv4/BOOTP servers</p>

<p>In DHCPv4 mode, a list of one or more server addresses
must be speci- fied on the command line, to which DHCP/BOOTP
queries should be relayed.</p>

<p>Options available for both DHCPv4 and DHCPv6:</p>

<p>-c COUNT Maximum hop count. When forwarding packets,
dhcrelay discards packets which have reached a hop count of
COUNT. Default is 10. Maximum is 255.</p>

<p>-d Force dhcrelay to run as a foreground process. Useful
when run- ning dhcrelay under a debugger, or running out of
inittab on System V systems.</p>

<p>-p PORT Listen and transmit on port PORT. This is mostly
useful for debugging purposes. Default is port 67 for
DHCPv4/BOOTP, or port 547 for DHCPv6.</p>

<p>-q Quiet mode. Prevents dhcrelay6 from printing its
network con- figuration on startup.</p>

<p>Options available in DHCPv4 mode only:</p>

<p>-a Append an agent option field to each request before
forwarding it to the server. Agent option fields in
responses sent from servers to clients will be stripped
before forwarding such responses back to the client. The
agent option field will con- tain two agent options: the
Circuit ID suboption and the Remote ID suboption. Currently,
the Circuit ID will be the printable name of the interface
on which the client request was received. The client
supports inclusion of a Remote ID suboption as well, but
this is not used by default.</p>

<p>-A LENGTH Specify the maximum packet size to send to a
DHCPv4/BOOTP server. This might be done to allow sufficient
space for addi- tion of relay agent options while still
fitting into the Ether- net MTU size.</p>

<p>-D Drop packets from upstream servers if they contain
Relay Agent Information options that indicate they were
generated in response to a query that came via a different
relay agent. If this option is not specified, such packets
will be relayed any- way.</p>

<p>-i ifname Listen for DHCPv4/BOOTP queries on interface
ifname. Multiple interfaces may be specified by using more
than one -i option. If no interfaces are specified on the
command line, dhcrelay will identify all network interfaces,
eliminating non-broadcast interfaces if possible, and
attempt to listen on all of them.</p>

<p>-m append|replace|forward|discard Control the handling
of incoming DHCPv4 packets which already contain relay agent
options. If such a packet does not have giaddr set in its
header, the DHCP standard requires that the packet be
discarded. However, if giaddr is set, the relay agent may
handle the situation in four ways: It may append its own set
of relay options to the packet, leaving the supplied option
field intact; it may replace the existing agent option
field; it may forward the packet unchanged; or, it may
discard it.</p>

<p>Options available in DHCPv6 mode only:</p>

<p>-I Force use of the DHCPv6 Interface-ID option. This
option is automatically sent when there are two or more
downstream inter- faces in use, to disambiguate between
them. The -I option causes dhcrelay to send the option even
if there is only one downstream interface.</p>

<p>-l [address%]ifname[#index] Specifies the lower network
interface for DHCPv6 relay mode: the interface on which
queries will be received from clients or from other relay
agents. At least one -l option must be included in the
command line when running in DHCPv6 mode. The interface name
ifname is a mandatory parameter. The link address can be
specified by address%; if it isnt, dhcrelay will use the
first non-link-local address configured on the inter- face.
The optional #index parameter specifies the interface
index.</p>

<p>-u [address%]ifname Specifies the upper network
interface for DHCPv6 relay mode: the interface to which
queries from clients and other relay agents should be
forwarded. At least one -u option must be included in the
command line when running in DHCPv6 mode. The interface name
ifname is a mandatory parameter. The destination unicast or
multicast address can be specified by address%; if not
specified, the relay agent will forward to the DHCPv6
All_DHCP_Relay_Agents_and_Servers multicast address.</p>

<p>It is possible to specify the same interface with
different addresses more than once, and even, when the
system supports it, to use the same interface as both upper
and lower interfaces.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO dhclient(8), dhcpd(8), RFC3315, RFC2132,
RFC2131.</p>

<p>BUGS Using the same interface on both upper and lower
sides may cause loops, so when running this way, the maximum
hop count should be set to a low value.</p>

<p>The loopback interface is not (yet) recognized as a
valid interface.</p>
