<p>NAME doveadm-altmove - Move matching mails to the
alternative storage (dbox-only)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS doveadm [-Dv] altmove search_query doveadm
[-Dv] altmove -A search_query doveadm [-Dv] altmove -u user
search_query</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This command can be used with dbox or mdbox
storage to move mails to alternative storage path when
:ALT=&lt;path&gt; is specified for the mail location.</p>

<p>In the first form, doveadm(1) will executed the altmove
action with the environment of the logged in system
user.</p>

<p>In the second form, the command will be performed for
all users.</p>

<p>In the third form, only matching mails of the given
user(s) will be moved to the alternative storage.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Global doveadm(1) options:</p>

<p>-D Enables verbosity and debug messages.</p>

<p>-v Enables verbosity, including progress counter.</p>

<p>Command specific options:</p>

<p>-A If the -A option is present, the command will be
performed for all users. Using this option in combination
with system users from userdb { driver = passwd } is not
recommended, because it contains also users with a lower UID
than the one configured with the first_valid_uid
setting.</p>

<p>When the sql userdb module is used make sure that the
iter- ate_query setting in the
/etc/dovecot/dovecot-sql.conf.ext matches your database
layout. Otherwise doveadm(1) will be unable to iterate over
all users.</p>

<p>-u user/mask Run the command only for the given user.
It&rsquo;s also possible to use &rsquo;*&rsquo; and
&rsquo;?&rsquo; wildcards (e.g. -u *@example.org). When
neither the -A option nor -u user was specified, the com-
mand will be executed with the environment of the currently
logged in user.</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS search_query Messages matching this search
query will be moved to alt stor- age. See
doveadm-search-query(7) for details.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/dovecot/conf.d/10-mail.conf Mailbox locations
and namespaces.</p>

<p>/etc/dovecot/conf.d/auth-*.conf.ext Authentication
processes, including userdb settings.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE This example moves seen mails older than one
week to alternative stor- age under /nfsmount: mail_location
= mdbox:~/mdbox:ALT=/nfsmount/%h/mdbox</p>

<p>doveadm altmove -u johnd@example.com seen savedbefore
1w</p>
