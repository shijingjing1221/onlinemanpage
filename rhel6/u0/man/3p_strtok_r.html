<p>STRTOK(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual STRTOK(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME strtok, strtok_r - split string into tokens</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;string.h&gt;</p>

<p>char *strtok(char *restrict s1, const char *restrict
s2);</p>

<p>char *strtok_r(char *restrict s, const char *restrict
sep, char **restrict lasts);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION For strtok(): The functionality described on
this reference page is aligned with the ISO C standard. Any
conflict between the requirements described here and the ISO
C standard is unintentional. This volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001 defers to the ISO C standard.</p>

<p>A sequence of calls to strtok() breaks the string
pointed to by s1 into a sequence of tokens, each of which is
delimited by a byte from the string pointed to by s2. The
first call in the sequence has s1 as its first argument, and
is followed by calls with a null pointer as their first
argument. The separator string pointed to by s2 may be
different from call to call.</p>

<p>The first call in the sequence searches the string
pointed to by s1 for the first byte that is not contained in
the current separator string pointed to by s2. If no such
byte is found, then there are no tokens in the string
pointed to by s1 and strtok() shall return a null pointer.
If such a byte is found, it is the start of the first
token.</p>

<p>The strtok() function then searches from there for a
byte that is con- tained in the current separator string. If
no such byte is found, the current token extends to the end
of the string pointed to by s1, and subsequent searches for
a token shall return a null pointer. If such a byte is
found, it is overwritten by a null byte, which terminates
the current token. The strtok() function saves a pointer to
the following byte, from which the next search for a token
shall start.</p>

<p>Each subsequent call, with a null pointer as the value
of the first argument, starts searching from the saved
pointer and behaves as described above.</p>

<p>The implementation shall behave as if no function
defined in this vol- ume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 calls
strtok().</p>

<p>The strtok() function need not be reentrant. A function
that is not required to be reentrant is not required to be
thread-safe.</p>

<p>The strtok_r() function considers the null-terminated
string s as a sequence of zero or more text tokens separated
by spans of one or more characters from the separator string
sep. The argument lasts points to a user-provided pointer
which points to stored information necessary for strtok_r()
to continue scanning the same string.</p>

<p>In the first call to strtok_r(), s points to a
null-terminated string, sep to a null-terminated string of
separator characters, and the value pointed to by lasts is
ignored. The strtok_r() function shall return a pointer to
the first character of the first token, write a null charac-
ter into s immediately following the returned token, and
update the pointer to which lasts points.</p>

<p>In subsequent calls, s is a NULL pointer and lasts shall
be unchanged from the previous call so that subsequent calls
shall move through the string s, returning successive tokens
until no tokens remain. The sepa- rator string sep may be
different from call to call. When no token remains in s, a
NULL pointer shall be returned.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, strtok() shall
return a pointer to the first byte of a token. Otherwise, if
there is no token, strtok() shall return a null pointer.</p>

<p>The strtok_r() function shall return a pointer to the
token found, or a NULL pointer when no token is found.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Searching for Word Separators The following
example searches for tokens separated by &lt;space&gt;s.</p>

<p>#include &lt;string.h&gt; ... char *token; char *line =
&quot;LINE TO BE SEPARATED&quot;; char *search = &quot;
&quot;;</p>

<p>/* Token will point to &quot;LINE&quot;. */ token =
strtok(line, search);</p>

<p>/* Token will point to &quot;TO&quot;. */ token =
strtok(NULL, search);</p>

<p>Breaking a Line The following example uses strtok() to
break a line into two character strings separated by any
combination of &lt;space&gt;s, &lt;tab&gt;s, or &lt;new-
line&gt;s.</p>

<p>#include &lt;string.h&gt; ... struct element { char
*key; char *data; }; ... char line[LINE_MAX]; char *key,
*data; ... key = strtok(line, &quot; n&quot;); data =
strtok(NULL, &quot; n&quot;); ...</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The strtok_r() function is thread-safe
and stores its state in a user- supplied buffer instead of
possibly using a static data area that may be overwritten by
an unrelated call from another thread.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The strtok() function searches for a separator
string within a larger string. It returns a pointer to the
last substring between separator strings. This function uses
static storage to keep track of the current string position
between calls. The new function, strtok_r(), takes an
additional argument, lasts, to keep track of the current
position in the string.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
