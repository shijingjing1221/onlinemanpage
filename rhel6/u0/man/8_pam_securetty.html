<p>NAME pam_securetty - Limit root login to special
devices</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pam_securetty.so [debug]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pam_securetty is a PAM module that allows
root logins only if the user is logging in on a
&quot;secure&quot; tty, as defined by the listing in
/etc/securetty. pam_securetty also checks to make sure that
/etc/securetty is a plain file and not world writable.</p>

<p>This module has no effect on non-root users and requires
that the application fills in the PAM_TTY item
correctly.</p>

<p>For canonical usage, should be listed as a required
authentication method before any sufficient authentication
methods.</p>

<p>OPTIONS debug Print debug information.</p>

<p>MODULE TYPES PROVIDED Only the auth module type is
provided.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUES PAM_SUCCESS The user is allowed to
continue authentication. Either the user is not root, or the
root user is trying to log in on an acceptable device.</p>

<p>PAM_AUTH_ERR Authentication is rejected. Either root is
attempting to log in via an unacceptable device, or the
/etc/securetty file is world writable or not a normal
file.</p>

<p>PAM_INCOMPLETE An application error occurred.
pam_securetty was not able to get information it required
from the application that called it.</p>

<p>PAM_SERVICE_ERR An error occurred while the module was
determining the user&acute;s name or tty, or the module
could not open /etc/securetty.</p>

<p>PAM_USER_UNKNOWN The module could not find the user name
in the /etc/passwd file to verify whether the user had a UID
of 0. Therefore, the results of running this module are
ignored.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES auth required pam_securetty.so auth required
pam_unix.so</p>
