<p>NAME mkzonedb - Utility create a zone file for
isdnlog</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS mkzonedb -r zonefile -d database [-v] [-V] [-o
Oz] [-l len]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION mkzonedb reads a text file with zone (area
code) information, and writes it in a special format to the
database file so that other apps such as isdnlog can easily
access the data.</p>

<p>This data is used to determine in what &quot;zone&quot;
a given area code is in relation to another, to see what
rate applies to a call between these area codes (&quot;is
the call a local call&quot;).</p>

<p>This utility is really only used during the building of
the isdnlog- data package, but it may be useful for those
who want to create their own custom tables.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -r zonefile the text file with the zone
information. Use &quot;-&quot; for standard input.</p>

<p>-d database the output database filename</p>

<p>-v verbose mode</p>

<p>-V show version information, and quit (don t do
anything)</p>

<p>-o Oz Use &quot;Oz&quot; area zone. Default is 1. (What
does this mean, exactly?)</p>

<p>-l len &quot;len&quot; is the length of areacodes. If 5
or more is given, then more space is allocated for the
internal tables (40000 instead of 10000 numbers allowed).
Other values arent really used.</p>
