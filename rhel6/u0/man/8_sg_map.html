<p>NAME sg_map - displays mapping between linux sg and
other SCSI devices</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sg_map [-a] [-h] [-i] [-n] [-scd] [-sd] [-sr]
[-st] [-V] [-x]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Sometimes it is difficult to determine which
SCSI device a sg device name (e.g. /dev/sg0) refers to. This
command loops through the sg devices and finds the
corresponding SCSI disk, cdrom or tape device name (if any).
Scanners are an example of SCSI devices that have no
alternate SCSI device name apart from their sg device
name.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -a assume the sg devices have alphabetical
device names and loop through /dev/sga, /dev/sgb, etc.
Default is numeric scan. Note that sg device nodes with an
alphabetical index have been depre- cated since the linux
kernel 2.2 series.</p>

<p>-h print usage message then exit.</p>

<p>-i in addition do a standard INQUIRY and output vendor,
product and revision strings for devices that are found.</p>

<p>-n assume the sg devices have numeric device names and
loop through /dev/sg0, /dev/sg1, etc. Default is numeric
scan</p>

<p>-scd display mappings to SCSI cdrom device names of the
form /dev/scd0, /dev/scd1 etc</p>

<p>-sd display mappings to SCSI disk device names</p>

<p>-sr display mappings to SCSI cdrom device names of the
form /dev/sr0, /dev/sr1 etc</p>

<p>-st display mappings to SCSI tape device names</p>

<p>-V print out version string then exit (without further
ado).</p>

<p>-x after each active sg device name is displayed there
are five digits: &lt;host_number&gt; &lt;bus&gt;
&lt;scsi_id&gt; &lt;lun&gt; &lt;scsi_type&gt;</p>

<p>NOTES If no options starting with &quot;-s&quot; are
given then the mapping to all SCSI disk, cdrom and tape
device names is shown.</p>

<p>If the device file system (devfs) is present a line
noting this is out- put. The &quot;native&quot; devfs scsi
hierarchy makes the relationship between a sg device name
and any corresponding disk, cdrom or tape device name easy
to establish. This replaces the need for this command.
However many applications will continue to look for Linux
SCSI device names in their traditional places. [Devfs
supplies a compatibility daemon called devfsd whose default
configuration adds back the Linux device names in their
traditional positions.</p>

<p>Quite often the mapping information can be derived by
observing the output of the command: &quot;cat
/proc/scsi/scsi&quot;. However if devices have been added
since boot this can be deceptive.</p>

<p>In the linux kernel 2.6 series something close to the
mapping shown by this utility can be found by analysing
sysfs. The main difference is that sysfs analysis will show
the mapping between sg nodes and other SCSI device nodes in
terms of major and minor numbers. While major 8, minor 16
will usually be /dev/sdb this is not necessarily so. Facili-
ties associated with udev may assign major 8, minor 16 some
other device node name. This version of sg_map has been
extended to cope with sparse disk device node names of the
form &quot;/dev/sd&lt;str&gt;&quot; where &lt;str&gt; can be
one of [a-z,aa-zz,aaa-zzz]. See the sg_map26 utility for a
more precise way (i.e. less directory scanning) for mapping
between sg device names and higher level names; including
finding user defined names.</p>

<p>This utility was written at a time when hotplugging of
SCSI devices was not supported in Linux. It used a simple
algorithm to scan sg device nodes in ascending numeric or
alphabetical order, stopping after there were 5 consecutive
errors.</p>

<p>In the linux kernel 2.6 series, this utility uses sysfs
to find which sg device nodes are active and only checks
those. Hence there can be large &quot;holes&quot; in the
numbering of sg device nodes (e.g. after an adapter has been
removed) and still all active sg device nodes will be
listed. This utility assumes that sg device nodes are named
using the normal conventions and searches from /dev/sg0 to
/dev/sg4095 inclusive.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES My system has a SCSI disk, a cd writer and a
dvd player: $ sg_map # Note: the devfs pseudo file system is
present /dev/sg0 /dev/sda /dev/sg1 /dev/sr0 /dev/sg2
/dev/sr1</p>

<p>In order to find which sg device name corresponds to the
disk: $ sg_map -sd # Note: the devfs pseudo file system is
present /dev/sg0 /dev/sda /dev/sg1 /dev/sg2</p>

<p>The &quot;-x&quot; option gives the following output:
sg_map -x # Note: the devfs pseudo file system is present
/dev/sg0 1 0 1 0 0 /dev/sda /dev/sg1 2 0 4 0 5 /dev/sr0
/dev/sg2 2 0 6 0 5 /dev/sr1</p>

<p>When a SCSI scanner is added the output becomes: $
sg_map # Note: the devfs pseudo file system is present
/dev/sg0 /dev/sda /dev/sg1 /dev/sr0 /dev/sg2 /dev/sr1
/dev/sg3</p>

<p>By process of elimination /dev/sg3 must be the
scanner.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The exit status of sg_map is 0 when it is
successful. Otherwise see the sg3_utils(8) man page.</p>
