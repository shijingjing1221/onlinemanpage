<p>NAME pnmquant - quantize the colors in a Netpbm image to
a smaller set</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pnmquant [-center|-meancolor|-meanpixel]
[-floyd|-fs] [-nofloyd|-nofs]
[-spreadbrightness|-spreadluminosity] ncolors [pnmfile]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pnmquant reads a PNM image as input. It chooses ncolors
colors to best represent the image, maps the existing colors
to the new ones, and writes a PNM image as output.</p>

<p>All options can be abbreviated to their shortest unique
prefix. You may use two hyphens instead of one to designate
an option. You may use either white space or equals signs
between an option name and its value.</p>

<p>This program is simply a combination of pnmcolormap and
pnmremap, where the colors of the input are remapped using a
color map which is gener- ated from the colors in that same
input. The options have the same meaning as in those
programs. See their documentation to understand
pnmquant.</p>

<p>It is much faster to call pnmcolormap and pnmremap
directly than to run pnmquant. You save the overhead of the
Perl interpreter and creating two extra processes. pnmquant
is just a convenience.</p>

<p>pnmquant did not exist before Netpbm 9.21 (January
2001). Before that, ppmquant did the same thing, but only on
PPM images. ppmquant contin- ues to exist, but is only a
front end (for name compatibility) to pnmquant.</p>
