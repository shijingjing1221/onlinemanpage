<p>PTHREAD_KILL(3) Linux Programmer s Manual
PTHREAD_KILL(3)</p>

<p>NAME pthread_kill - send a signal to a thread</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;signal.h&gt;</p>

<p>int pthread_kill(pthread_t thread, int sig);</p>

<p>Compile and link with -pthread.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pthread_kill() function sends the signal
sig to thread, another thread in the same process as the
caller. The signal is asynchronously directed to thread.</p>

<p>If sig is 0, then no signal is sent, but error checking
is still per- formed; this can be used to check for the
existence of a thread ID.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, pthread_kill() returns 0; on
error, it returns an error number, and no signal is
sent.</p>

<p>ERRORS ESRCH No thread with the ID thread could be
found.</p>

<p>EINVAL An invalid signal was specified.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>NOTES Signal dispositions are process-wide: if a signal
handler is installed, the handler will be invoked in the
thread thread, but if the disposi- tion of the signal is
&quot;stop&quot;, &quot;continue&quot;, or
&quot;terminate&quot;, this action will affect the whole
process.</p>
