<p>AUTOFS_LDAP_AUTH.CONF(5) AUTOFS_LDAP_AUTH.CONF(5)</p>

<p>NAME autofs_ldap_auth.conf - autofs LDAP authentication
configuration</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION LDAP authenticated binds, TLS encrypted
connections and certification may be used by setting
appropriate values in the autofs authentication
configuration file and configuring the LDAP client with
appropriate settings. The default location of this file is
/etc/autofs_ldap_auth.conf. If this file exists it will be
used to es- tablish whether TLS or authentication should be
used.</p>

<p>An example of this file is:</p>

<p>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; ?&gt;
&lt;autofs_ldap_sasl_conf usetls=&quot;yes&quot;
tlsrequired=&quot;no&quot; authrequired=&quot;no&quot;
authtype=&quot;DIGEST-MD5&quot; user=&quot;xyz&quot;
secret=&quot;abc&quot; /&gt;</p>

<p>If TLS encryption is to be used the location of the
Certificate Author- ity certificate must be set within the
LDAP client configuration in or- der to validate the server
certificate. If, in addition, a certified connection is to
be used then the client certificate and private key file
locations must also be configured within the LDAP
client.</p>

<p>OPTIONS This files contains a single XML element, as
shown in the example above, with several attributes.</p>

<p>The possible attributes are:</p>

<p>usetls=&quot;yes&quot;|&quot;no&quot; Determines whether
an encrypted connection to the ldap server should be
attempted.</p>

<p>tlsrequired=&quot;yes&quot;|&quot;no&quot; This flag
tells whether the ldap connection must be encrypted. If set
to &quot;yes&quot;, the automounter will fail to start if an
en- crypted connection cannot be established.</p>


<p>authrequired=&quot;yes&quot;|&quot;no&quot;|&quot;autodetect&quot;
This option tells whether an authenticated connection to the
ldap server is required in order to perform ldap queries. If
this flag is set to yes, then only authenticated connections
will be allowed. If it is set to no then authentication is
not needed for ldap server connections. Finally, if it is
set to au- todetect then the ldap server will be queried to
establish a suitable authentication mechanism. If no
suitable mechanism can be found, connections to the ldap
server are made without au- thentication.</p>


<p>authtype=&quot;GSSAPI&quot;|&quot;LOGIN&quot;|&quot;PLAIN&quot;|&quot;ANONYMOUS&quot;|&quot;DIGEST-MD5&quot;
This attribute can be used to specify a preferred
authentication mechanism. In normal operations, the
automounter will attempt to authenti- cate to the ldap
server using the list of supportedSASLmecha- nisms obtained
from the directory server. Explicitly setting the authtype
will bypass this selection and only try the mecha- nism
specified.</p>

<p>user=&quot;&lt;username&gt;&quot; This attribute holds
the authentication identity used by authen- tication
mechanisms that require it. Legal values for this at-
tribute include any printable characters that can be used by
the selected authentication mechanism.</p>

<p>secret=&quot;&lt;password&gt;&quot; This attribute holds
the secret used by authentication mecha- nisms that require
it. Legal values for this attribute include any printable
characters that can be used by the selected au- thentication
mechanism.</p>

<p>clientprinc=&quot;&lt;GSSAPI client principal&gt;&quot;
When using GSSAPI authentication, this attribute is
consulted to determine the principal name to use when
authenticating to the directory server. By default, this
will be set to &quot;autof-
sclient/&lt;fqdn&gt;@&lt;REALM&gt;.</p>

<p>credentialcache=&quot;&lt;external credential cache
path&gt;&quot; When using GSSAPI authentication, this
attribute can be used to specify an externally configured
credential cache that is used during authentication. By
default, autofs will setup a memory based credential
cache.</p>
