<p>NAME snmp_config - handling of Net-SNMP configuration
files</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The Net-SNMP package uses various
configuration files to configure its applications. This
manual page merely describes the overall nature of them, so
that the other manual pages dont have to.</p>

<p>DIRECTORIES SEARCHED First off, there are numerous
places that configuration files can be found and read from.
By default, the applications look for configura- tion files
in the following 4 directories, in order: /etc/snmp,
/usr/share/snmp, /usr/lib(64)/snmp, and $HOME/.snmp. In each
of these directories, it looks for files with the extension
of both conf and local.conf (reading the second ones last).
In this manner, there are 8 default places a configuration
file can exist for any given configura- tion file type.</p>

<p>Additionally, the above default search path can be
overridden by set- ting the environment variable
SNMPCONFPATH to a colon-separated list of directories to
search for. The path for the persistent data should be
included when running applications that use persistent
storage, such as snmpd.</p>

<p>Applications will read persistent configuration files in
the following order of preference:</p>

<p>file in SNMP_PERSISTENT_FILE environment variable</p>

<p>directories in SNMPCONFPATH environment variable</p>

<p>directory defined by persistentDir snmp.conf
variable</p>

<p>directory in SNMP_PERSISTENT_DIR environment
variable</p>

<p>default /var/lib/net-snmp directory</p>

<p>Finally, applications will write persistent
configuration files in the following order of
preference:</p>

<p>file in SNMP_PERSISTENT_FILE environment variable</p>

<p>directory defined by persistentDir snmp.conf
variable</p>

<p>directory in SNMP_PERSISTENT_DIR environment
variable</p>

<p>default /var/lib/net-snmp directory</p>

<p>Note: When using SNMP_PERSISTENT_FILE, the filename
should match the application name. For example,
/var/net-snmp/snmpd.conf.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION FILE TYPES Each application may use
multiple configuration files, which will con- figure various
different aspects of the application. For instance, the SNMP
agent (snmpd) knows how to understand configuration
directives in both the snmpd.conf and the snmp.conf files.
In fact, most applica- tions understand how to read the
contents of the snmp.conf files. Note, however, that
configuration directives understood in one file may not be
understood in another file. For further information, read
the associated manual page with each configuration file
type. Also, most of the applications support a -H switch on
the command line that will list the configuration files it
will look for and the directives in each one that it
understands.</p>

<p>The snmp.conf configuration file is intended to be a
application suite wide configuration file that supports
directives that are useful for controlling the fundamental
nature of all of the SNMP applications, such as how they all
manipulate and parse the textual SNMP MIB files.</p>

<p>SWITCHING CONFIGURATION TYPES IN MID-FILE It s possible
to switch in mid-file the configuration type that the parser
is supposed to be reading. Since that sentence doesnt make
much sense, lets give you an example: say that you wanted to
turn on packet dumping output for the agent by default, but
you didnt want to do that for the rest of the applications
(ie, snmpget, snmpwalk, ...). Normally to enable packet
dumping in the configuration file youd need to put a line
like:</p>

<p>dumpPacket true</p>

<p>into the snmp.conf file. But, this would turn it on for
all of the applications. So, instead, you can put the same
line in the snmpd.conf file so that it only applies to the
snmpd daemon. However, you need to tell the parser to expect
this line. You do this by putting a special type
specification token inside a [] set. In other words, inside
your snmpd.conf file you could put the above snmp.conf
directive by adding a line like so:</p>

<p>[snmp] dumpPacket true</p>

<p>This tells the parser to parse the above line as if it
were inside a snmp.conf file instead of an snmpd.conf file.
If you want to parse a bunch of lines rather than just one
then you can make the context switch apply to the remainder
of the file or until the next context switch directive by
putting the special token on a line by itself:</p>

<p># make this file handle snmp.conf tokens: [snmp]
dumpPacket true logTimestamp true # return to our original
snmpd.conf tokens: [snmpd] rocommunity mypublic</p>

<p>COMMENTS Any lines beginning with the character # in the
configuration files are treated as a comment and are not
parsed.</p>

<p>API INTERFACE Information about writing C code that
makes use of this system in either the agents MIB modules or
in applications can be found in the read_config(3) manual
page.</p>
