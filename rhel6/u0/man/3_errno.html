<p>NAME errno - number of last error</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;errno.h&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The &lt;errno.h&gt; header file defines the
integer variable errno, which is set by system calls and
some library functions in the event of an error to indicate
what went wrong. Its value is significant only when the
return value of the call indicated an error (i.e., -1 from
most system calls; -1 or NULL from most library functions);
a function that suc- ceeds is allowed to change errno.</p>

<p>Valid error numbers are all non-zero; errno is never set
to zero by any system call or library function.</p>

<p>For some system calls and library functions (e.g.,
getpriority(2)), -1 is a valid return on success. In such
cases, a successful return can be distinguished from an
error return by setting errno to zero before the call, and
then, if the call returns a status that indicates that an
error may have occurred, checking to see if errno has a
non-zero value.</p>

<p>errno is defined by the ISO C standard to be a
modifiable lvalue of type int, and must not be explicitly
declared; errno may be a macro. errno is thread-local;
setting it in one thread does not affect its value in any
other thread.</p>

<p>All the error names specified by POSIX.1 must have
distinct values, with the exception of EAGAIN and
EWOULDBLOCK, which may be the same.</p>

<p>Below is a list of the symbolic error names that are
defined on Linux. Some of these are marked POSIX.1,
indicating that the name is defined by POSIX.1-2001, or C99,
indicating that the name is defined by C99.</p>

<p>NOTES A common mistake is to do</p>

<p>if (somecall() == -1) { printf(&quot;somecall()
failed0); if (errno == ...) { ... } }</p>

<p>where errno no longer needs to have the value it had
upon return from somecall() (i.e., it may have been changed
by the printf(3)). If the value of errno should be preserved
across a library call, it must be saved:</p>

<p>if (somecall() == -1) { int errsv = errno;
printf(&quot;somecall() failed0); if (errsv == ...) { ... }
}</p>

<p>It was common in traditional C to declare errno manually
(i.e., extern int errno) instead of including
&lt;errno.h&gt;. Do not do this. It will not work with
modern versions of the C library. However, on (very) old
Unix systems, there may be no &lt;errno.h&gt; and the
declaration is needed.</p>
