<p>FAILLOG(8) System Management Commands FAILLOG(8)</p>

<p>NAME faillog - display faillog records or set login
failure limits</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS faillog [options]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION faillog displays the contents of the failure
log database (/var/log/faillog). It can also set the failure
counters and limits. When faillog is run without arguments,
it only displays the faillog records of the users who had a
login failure.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The options which apply to the faillog command
are:</p>

<p>-a, --all Display (or act on) faillog records for all
users having an entry in the faillog database.</p>

<p>-h, --help Display help message and exit.</p>

<p>-l, --lock-time SEC Lock account for SEC seconds after
failed login.</p>

<p>Write access to /var/log/faillog is required for this
option.</p>

<p>-m, --maximum MAX Set the maximum number of login
failures after the account is disabled to MAX.</p>

<p>Selecting a MAX value of 0 has the effect of not placing
a limit on the number of failed logins.</p>

<p>The maximum failure count should always be 0 for root to
prevent a denial of services attack against the system.</p>

<p>Write access to /var/log/faillog is required for this
option.</p>

<p>-r, --reset Reset the counters of login failures.</p>

<p>Write access to /var/log/faillog is required for this
option.</p>

<p>-t, --time DAYS Display faillog records more recent than
DAYS.</p>

<p>-u, --user LOGIN|RANGE Display faillog record or
maintains failure counters and limits (if used with -l, -m
or -r options) only for the specified user(s).</p>

<p>The users can be specified by a login name, a numerical
user ID, or a RANGE of users. This RANGE of users can be
specified with a min and max values (UID_MIN-UID_MAX), a max
value (-UID_MAX), or a min value (UID_MIN-).</p>

<p>When none of the -l, -m, or -r options are used, faillog
displays the faillog record of the specified user(s).</p>

<p>NOTE: in display mode, only the records of users which
currently exist in the system are displayed. In the other
modes (when the -l, -m, or -r options are used), the records
of the user, or the range of users, or all the users that
may have an entry in the faillog database will be changed.
This is useful to reset records of users that have been
deleted or set a policy in advance for a range of users.</p>

<p>CAVEATS faillog only prints out users with no successful
login since the last failure. To print out a user who has
had a successful login since their last failure, you must
explicitly request the user with the -u flag, or print out
all users with the -a flag.</p>

<p>FILES /var/log/faillog Failure logging file.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO login(1), faillog(5).</p>
