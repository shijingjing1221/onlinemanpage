<p>XMESSAGE(1) XMESSAGE(1)</p>

<p>NAME xmessage - display a message or query in a window
(X-based /bin/echo)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS xmessage [ -buttons
label1[:value1],label2[:value2], ... ] [ options ] -file
filename xmessage [ -buttons
label1[:value1],label2[:value2], ... ] [ options ] message
...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The xmessage program displays a window
containing a message from the command line, a file, or
standard input. Along the lower edge of the message is row
of buttons; clicking the left mouse button on any of these
buttons will cause xmessage to exit. Which button was
pressed is returned in the exit status and, optionally, by
writing the label of the button to standard output.</p>

<p>The program is typically used by shell scripts to
display information to the user or to ask the user to make a
choice.</p>

<p>Unless a size is specified, xmessage sizes itself to fit
the message, up to a maximum size. If the message is too big
for the window, xmes- sage will display scroll bars.</p>

<p>OPTIONS These are the command line options that xmessage
understands.</p>

<p>-buttons button,button,... This option will cause
xmessage to create one button for each comma-separated
button argument. The corresponding resource is buttons. Each
button consists of a label optionally followed by a colon
and an exit value. The label is the name of the Command
button widget created and will be the default text dis-
played to the user. Since this is the name of the widget it
may be used to change any of the resources associated with
that button. The exit value will be returned by xmessage if
that button is selected. The default exit value is 100 plus
the button number. Buttons are numbered from the left
starting with one. The default string if no -buttons option
is given is okay:0.</p>

<p>-default label Defines the button with a matching label
to be the default. If not specified there is no default. The
corresponding resource is defaultButton. Pressing Return
anywhere in the xmessage window will activate the default
button. The default button has a wider border than the
others.</p>

<p>-file filename File to display. The corresponding
resource is file. A file- name of - reads from standard
input. If this option is not supplied, xmessage will display
all non-option arguments in the style of echo. Either -file
or a message on the command line should be provided, but not
both.</p>

<p>-print This will cause the program to write the label of
the button pressed to standard output. Equivalent to setting
the print- Value resource to TRUE. This is one way to get
feedback as to which button was pressed.</p>

<p>-center Pop up the window at the center of the screen.
Equivalent to setting the center resource to TRUE.</p>

<p>-nearmouse Pop up the window near the mouse cursor.
Equivalent to setting the nearMouse resource to TRUE.</p>

<p>-timeout secs Exit with status 0 after secs seconds if
the user has not clicked on a button yet. The corresponding
resource is time- out.</p>

<p>WIDGET HIERARCHY Knowing the name and position in the
hierarchy of each widget is useful when specifying resources
for them. In the following chart, the class and name of each
widget is given.</p>

<p>Xmessage (xmessage) Form form Text message Command
(label1) Command (label2) . . .</p>

<p>RESOURCES The program has a few top-level application
resources that allow cus- tomizations that are specific to
xmessage.</p>

<p>file A String specifying the file to display.</p>

<p>buttons A String specifying the buttons to display. See
the -buttons command-line option.</p>

<p>defaultButton A String specifying a default button by
label.</p>

<p>printValue A Boolean value specifying whether the label
of the button pressed to exit the program is written to
standard output. The default is FALSE.</p>

<p>center A Boolean value specifying whether to pop up the
window at the center of the screen. The default is
FALSE.</p>

<p>nearMouse A Boolean value specifying whether to pop up
the window near the mouse cursor. The default is FALSE.</p>

<p>timeout The number of seconds after which to exit with
status 0. The default is 0, which means never time out.</p>

<p>maxHeight (class Maximum) The maximum height of the text
part of the window in pixels, used if no size was specified
in the geometry. The default is 0, which means use 70% of
the height of the screen.</p>

<p>maxWidth (class Maximum) The maximum width of the text
part of the window in pixels, used if no size was specified
in the geometry. The default is 0, which means use 70% of
the width of the screen.</p>

<p>ACTIONS exit(value) exit immediately with an exit status
of value (default 0). This action can be used with
translations to provide alternate ways of exiting
xmessage.</p>

<p>default-exit() exit immediately with the exit status
specified by the default button. If there is no default
button, this action has no effect.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS If it detects an error, xmessage returns 1,
so this value should not be used with a button.</p>
