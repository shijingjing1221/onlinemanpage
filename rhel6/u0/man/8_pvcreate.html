<p>NAME pvcreate - initialize a disk or partition for use
by LVM</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pvcreate [-d|--debug] [-f[f]|--force [--force]]
[-y|--yes] [-h|--help] [-t|--test] [-v|--verbose]
[--labelsector] [-M|--metadatatypetype]
[--[pv]metadatacopies#copies] [--metadatasizesize]
[--metadataig- norey|n] [--dataalignmentalignment]
[--dataalignmentoffsetalign- ment_offset]
[--restorefilefile] [--norestorefile] [--setphysicalvol-
umesizesize] [-u|--uuiduuid] [--version] [-Z|--zeroy|n]
PhysicalVolume [PhysicalVolume...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pvcreate initializes PhysicalVolume for
later use by the Logical Volume Manager (LVM). Each
PhysicalVolume can be a disk partition, whole disk, meta
device, or loopback file. For DOS disk partitions, the par-
tition id should be set to 0x8e using fdisk(8), cfdisk(8),
or a equiva- lent. For whole disk devices only the partition
table must be erased, which will effectively destroy all
data on that disk. This can be done by zeroing the first
sector with:</p>

<p>dd if=/dev/zero of=PhysicalVolume bs=512 count=1</p>

<p>Continue with vgcreate(8) to create a new volume group
on PhysicalVol- ume, or vgextend(8) to add PhysicalVolume to
an existing volume group.</p>

<p>OPTIONS See lvm(8) for common options.</p>

<p>-f, --force Force the creation without any confirmation.
You can not recre- ate (reinitialize) a physical volume
belonging to an existing volume group. In an emergency you
can override this behaviour with -ff.</p>

<p>-u, --uuid uuid Specify the uuid for the device. Without
this option, pvcreate generates a random uuid. All of your
physical volumes must have unique uuids. You need to use
this option before restoring a backup of LVM metadata onto a
replacement device - see vgcfgre- store(8). As such, use of
--restorefile is compulsory unless the --norestorefile is
used.</p>

<p>-y, --yes Answer yes to all questions.</p>

<p>-Z, --zero y|n Whether or not the first 4 sectors (2048
bytes) of the device should be wiped. If this option is not
given, the default is to wipe these sectors unless either or
both of the --restorefile or --uuid options were
specified.</p>

<p>NEW METADATA OPTIONS LVM2 introduces a new format for
storing metadata on disk. This new format is more efficient
and resilient than the format the original version of LVM
used and offers the advanced user greater flexibility and
control.</p>

<p>The new format may be selected on the command line with
-M2 or by set- ting format = &quot;lvm2&quot; in the global
section of lvm.conf. Each physical volume in the same volume
group must use the same format, but different volume groups
on a machine may use different formats simultaneously: the
tools can handle both formats. Additional formats can be
added as shared libraries.</p>

<p>Additional tools for manipulating the locations and
sizes of metadata areas will be written in due course. Use
the verbose/debug options on the tools to see where the
metadata areas are placed.</p>

<p>--metadatasize size The approximate amount of space to
be set aside for each meta- data area. (The size you specify
may get rounded.)</p>

<p>--dataalignment alignment Align the start of the data to
a multiple of this number. You should also specify an
appropriate PhysicalExtentSize when cre- ating the Volume
Group with vgcreate.</p>

<p>To see the location of the first Physical Extent of an
existing Physical Volume use pvs -o +pe_start . It will be a
multiple of the requested alignment. In addition it may be
shifted by alignment_offset from
data_alignment_offset_detection (if enabled in lvm.conf) or
--dataalignmentoffset.</p>

<p>--dataalignmentoffset alignment_offset Shift the start
of the data area by this additional align- ment_offset.</p>

<p>--[pv]metadatacopies copies The number of metadata areas
to set aside on each PV. Currently this can be 0, 1 or 2. If
set to 2, two copies of the volume group metadata are held
on the PV, one at the front of the PV and one at the end. If
set to 1 (the default), one copy is kept at the front of the
PV (starting in the 5th sector). If set to 0, no copies are
kept on this PV - you might wish to use this with VGs
containing large numbers of PVs. But if you do this and then
later use vgsplit you must ensure that each VG is still
going to have a suitable number of copies of the metadata
after the split!</p>

<p>--metadataignore y|n Ignore or un-ignore metadata areas
on this physical volume. The default is &quot;n&quot;. This
setting can be changed with pvchange. If metadata areas on a
physical volume are ignored, LVM will not not store metadata
in the metadata areas present on this Physi- cal Volume.
Metadata areas cannot be created or extended after Logical
Volumes have been allocated on the device. If you do not
want to store metadata on this device, it is still wise
always to allocate a metadata area in case you need it in
the future and to use this option to instruct LVM2 to ignore
it.</p>

<p>--restorefile file In conjunction with --uuid, this
extracts the location and size of the data on the PV from
the file (produced by vgcfgbackup) and ensures that the
metadata that the program produces is con- sistent with the
contents of the file i.e. the physical extents will be in
the same place and not get overwritten by new meta- data.
This provides a mechanism to upgrade the metadata format or
to add/remove metadata areas. Use with care. See also vgcon-
vert(8).</p>

<p>--norestorefile In conjunction with --uuid, this allows
a uuid to be specified without also requiring that a backup
of the metadata be pro- vided.</p>

<p>--labelsector sector By default the PV is labelled with
an LVM2 identifier in its second sector (sector 1). This
lets you use a different sector near the start of the disk
(between 0 and 3 inclusive - see LABEL_SCAN_SECTORS in the
source). Use with care.</p>

<p>--setphysicalvolumesize size Overrides the
automatically-detected size of the PV. Use with care.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Initialize partition #4 on the third SCSI disk
and the entire fifth SCSI disk for later use by LVM:</p>

<p>pvcreate /dev/sdc4 /dev/sde</p>

<p>If the 2nd SCSI disk is a 4KB sector drive that
compensates for windows partitioning (sector 7 is the lowest
aligned logical block, the 4KB sectors start at LBA -1, and
consequently sector 63 is aligned on a 4KB boundary)
manually account for this when initializing for use by
LVM:</p>

<p>pvcreate --dataalignmentoffset 7s /dev/sdb</p>
