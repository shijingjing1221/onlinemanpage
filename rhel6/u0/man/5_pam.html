<p>PAM format specification(5) PAM format
specification(5)</p>

<p>NAME pam - Netpbm common 2-dimensional bitmap format</p>

<p>GENERAL The PAM image format is a lowest common
denominator 2 dimensional map format.</p>

<p>It is designed to be used for any of myriad kinds of
graphics, but can theoretically be used for any kind of data
that is arranged as a two dimensional rectangular array.
Actually, from another perspective it can be seen as a
format for data arranged as a three dimensional array.</p>

<p>The name PAM is an acronym derived from Portable
Arbitrary Map. This derivation makes more sense if you
consider it in the context of the other Netpbm format names:
PBM, PGM, and PPM.</p>

<p>This format does not define the meaning of the data at
any particular point in the array. It could be red, green,
and blue light intensities such that the array represents a
visual image, or it could be the same red, green, and blue
components plus a transparency component, or it could
contain annual rainfalls for places on the surface of the
Earth. Any process that uses the PAM format must further
define the format to specify the meanings of the data.</p>

<p>A PAM image describes a two dimensional grid of tuples.
The tuples are arranged in rows and columns. The width of
the image is the number of columns. The height of the image
is the number of rows. All rows are the same width and all
columns are the same height. The tuples may have any degree,
but all tuples have the same degree. The degree of the
tuples is called the depth of the image. Each member of a
tuple is called a sample. A sample is an unsigned integer
which represents a locus along a scale which starts at zero
and ends at a certain maximum value greater than zero called
the maxval. The maxval is the same for every sample in the
image. The two dimensional array of all the Nth samples of
each tuple is called the Nth plane or Nth channel of the
image.</p>

<p>Though the basic format does not assign any meaning to
the tuple val- ues, it does include an optional string that
describes that meaning. The contents of this string, called
the tuple type, are arbitrary from the point of view of the
basic PAM format, but users of the format may assign meaning
to it by convention so they can identify their particu- lar
implementations of the PAM format. Some tuple types are
defined as official subformats of PAM. See Defined Tuple
Types .</p>

<p>The Confusing Universe of Netpbm Formats It is easy to
get confused about the relationship between the PAM for- mat
and PBM, PGM, PPM, and PNM. Here is a little
enlightenment:</p>

<p>&quot;PNM&quot; is not really a format. It is a
shorthand for the PBM, PGM, and PPM formats collectively. It
is also the name of a group of library functions that can
each handle all three of those formats.</p>

<p>PAM is in fact a fourth format. But it is so general
that you can represent the same information in a PAM image
as you can in a PBM, PGM, or PPM image. And in fact a
program that is designed to read PBM, PGM, or PPM and does
so with a recent version of the Netpbm library, will read an
equivalent PAM image just fine and the program will never
know the difference.</p>

<p>To confuse things more, there is a collection of library
routines called the pam functions that read and write the
PAM format, but also read and write the PBM, PGM, and PPM
formats. They do this because the latter formats are much
older and more popular, so even a new program must work with
them. Having the library handle all the formats makes it
convenient to write programs that use the newer PAM format
as well.</p>

<p>THE LAYOUT A convenient way to read and write the PAM
format accurately is via the
libnetpbm(1)Csubroutinelibrary.</p>

<p>A PAM file consists of a sequence of one or more PAM
images. There are no data, delimiters, or padding before,
after, or between images.</p>

<p>Each PAM image consists of a header followed immediately
by a raster.</p>

<p>Here is an example header:</p>

<p>P7 WIDTH 227 HEIGHT 149 DEPTH 3 MAXVAL 255 TUPLTYPE RGB
ENDHDR</p>

<p>The header begins with the ASCII characters P7 followed
by newline. This is the magic number.</p>

<p>Note: xv thumbnail images also start with the
&quot;P7&quot; magic number. (This and PAM were independent
extensions to the Netpbm formats). The rest of the format
makes it easy to distinguish PAM from that format,
though).</p>

<p>The header continues with an arbitrary number of lines
of ASCII text. Each line ends with and is delimited by a
newline character.</p>

<p>Each header line consists of zero or more
whitespace-delimited tokens or begins with #. If it begins
with # it is a comment and the rest of this specification
does not apply to it.</p>

<p>A header line which has zero tokens is valid but has no
meaning.</p>

<p>The type of header line is identified by its first
token, which is 8 characters or less:</p>

<p>ENDHDR This is the last line in the header. The header
must contain exactly one of these header lines.</p>

<p>HEIGHT The second token is a decimal number representing
the height of the image (number of rows). The header must
contain exactly one of these header lines.</p>

<p>WIDTH The second token is a decimal number representing
the width of the image (number of columns). The header must
contain exactly one of these header lines.</p>

<p>DEPTH The second token is a decimal number representing
the depth of the image (number of planes or channels). The
header must con- tain exactly one of these header lines.</p>

<p>MAXVAL The second token is a decimal number representing
the maxval of the image. The header must contain exactly one
of these header lines.</p>

<p>TUPLTYPE The header may contain any number of these
header lines, includ- ing zero. The rest of the line is part
of the tuple type. The rest of the line is not tokenized,
but the tuple type does not include any white space
immediately following TUPLTYPE or at the very end of the
line. It does not include a newline. There must be something
other than white space after the TUPLTYPE token.</p>

<p>If there are multiple TUPLTYPE header lines, the tuple
type is the concatenation of the values from each of them,
separated by a single blank, in the order in which they
appear in the header. If there are no TUPLTYPE header lines
the tuple type is the null string.</p>

<p>The raster consists of each row of the image, in order
from top to bot- tom, consecutive with no delimiter of any
kind between, before, or after, rows.</p>

<p>Each row consists of every tuple in the row, in order
from left to right, consecutive with no delimiter of any
kind between, before, or after, tuples.</p>

<p>Each tuple consists of every sample in the tuple, in
order, consecutive with no delimiter of any kind between,
before, or after, samples.</p>

<p>Each sample consists of an unsigned integer in pure
binary format, with the most significant byte first. The
number of bytes is the minimum number of bytes required to
represent the maxval of the image.</p>

<p>The character referred to as newline herein is the
character known in ASCII as Line Feed or LF.</p>

<p>LIMITATIONS The maxval of an image is never greater than
65535. (The reason it is limited is to make it easier to
build an image processor, in which intermediate arithmetic
values often have to fit within 31 or 32 bits). There was no
specified limitation before October, 2005, but essentially
all implementations have always observed it.</p>

<p>Height and width are at least 1.</p>

<p>Height and width have no defined maximum, but processors
and generators of images usually have their own
limitations.</p>

<p>DEFINED TUPLE TYPES Some tuple types are defined in this
specification to specify official subformats of PAM for
especially popular applications of the format. Users of the
format may also define their own tuple types, and thus their
own subformats.</p>

<p>PAM Used For Visual Images A common use of PAM images is
to represent visual images such as are typically represented
by images in the older and more concrete PBM, PGM, and PPM
formats.</p>

<p>Black And White (PBM)</p>

<p>A black and white image, such as would be represented by
a PBM image, has a tuple type of &quot;BLACKANDWHITE&quot;.
Such a PAM image has a depth of 1 and maxval 1 where the one
sample in each tuple is 0 to represent a black pixel and 1
to represent a white one. The height, width, and raster bear
the obvious relationship to those of the equivalent PBM
image.</p>

<p>Note that in the PBM format, a zero value means white,
but in PAM, zero means black.</p>

<p>Grayscale (PGM)</p>

<p>A grayscale image, such as would be represented by a PGM
image, has a tuple type of &quot;GRAYSCALE&quot;. Such a PAM
image has a depth of 1. The maxval, height, width, and
raster bear the obvious relationship to those of the
equivalent PGM image.</p>

<p>Color (PPM)</p>

<p>A color image, such as would be represented by a PPM
image, has a typle type of &quot;RGB&quot;. Such a PAM image
has a depth of 3. The maxval, height, width, and raster bear
the obvious relationship to those of the PPM image. The
first plane represents red, the second blue, and the third
green.</p>

<p>Transparent</p>

<p>Each of the visual image formats mentioned above has a
variation that contains transparency information. In that
variation, the tuple type has _ALPHA added to it (e.g.
RGB_ALPHA) and one more plane. The highest numbered plane is
the opacity plane (sometimes called an alpha plane or
transparency plane).</p>

<p>In this kind of image, the color represented by a pixel
is actually a combination of an explicitly specified
foreground color and a back- ground color to be identified
later.</p>

<p>The planes other than the opacity plane describe the
foreground color. A sample in the opacity plane tells how
opaque the pixel is, by telling what fraction of the pixel s
light comes from the foreground color. The rest of the
pixels light comes from the (unspecified) background
color.</p>

<p>For example, in a GRAYSCALE_ALPHA image, assume Plane 0
indicates a gray tone 60% of white and Plane 1 indicates
opacity 25%. The fore- ground color is the 60% gray, and 25%
of that contributes to the ulti- mate color of the pixel.
The other 75% comes from some background color. So lets
assume further that the background color of the pixel is
full white. Then the color of the pixel is 90% of white: 25%
of the foreground 60%, plus 75% of the background 100%.</p>

<p>The sample value is the opacity fraction just described,
as a fraction of the maxval. Note that it is not
gamma-adjusted like the foreground color samples.</p>
