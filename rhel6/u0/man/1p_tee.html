<p>TEE(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual TEE(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME tee - duplicate standard input</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS tee [-ai][file...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The tee utility shall copy standard input to
standard output, making a copy in zero or more files. The
tee utility shall not buffer output.</p>

<p>If the -a option is not specified, output files shall be
written (see File Read, Write, and Creation .</p>

<p>OPTIONS The tee utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>The following options shall be supported:</p>

<p>-a Append the output to the files.</p>

<p>-i Ignore the SIGINT signal.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operands shall be supported:</p>

<p>file A pathname of an output file. Processing of at
least 13 file operands shall be supported.</p>

<p>STDIN The standard input can be of any type.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of tee:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in
arguments).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default, except that if the -i
option was specified, SIGINT shall be ignored.</p>

<p>STDOUT The standard output shall be a copy of the
standard input.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES If any file operands are specified, the
standard input shall be copied to each named file.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 The standard input was successfully copied to all
output files.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS If a write to any successfully
opened file operand fails, writes to other successfully
opened file operands and standard output shall con- tinue,
but the exit status shall be non-zero. Otherwise, the
default actions specified in Utility Description Defaults
apply.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The tee utility is usually used in a
pipeline, to make a copy of the output of some utility.</p>

<p>The file operand is technically optional, but tee is no
more useful than cat when none is specified.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Save an unsorted intermediate form of the data
in a pipeline:</p>

<p>... | tee unsorted | sort &gt; sorted</p>

<p>RATIONALE The buffering requirement means that tee is
not allowed to use ISO C standard fully buffered or
line-buffered writes. It does not mean that tee has to do
1-byte reads followed by 1-byte writes.</p>

<p>It should be noted that early versions of BSD ignore any
invalid options and accept a single-as an alternative to -i.
They also print a message if unable to open a file:</p>

<p>&quot;tee: cannot access %n&quot;, &lt;pathname&gt;</p>

<p>Historical implementations ignore write errors. This is
explicitly not permitted by this volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001.</p>

<p>Some historical implementations use O_APPEND when
providing append mode; others use the lseek() function to
seek to the end-of-file after opening the file without
O_APPEND. This volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 requires
functionality equivalent to using O_APPEND; see File Read,
Write, and Creation .</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
