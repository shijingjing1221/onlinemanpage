<p>sane-v4l(5) SANE Scanner Access Now Easy sane-v4l(5)</p>

<p>NAME sane-v4l - SANE interface for Video for Linux
API</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sane-v4l library implements a SANE
(Scanner Access Now Easy) back- end that provides generic
access to video cameras and similar equipment using the V4L
(Video for Linux) API.</p>

<p>This is ALPHA software. Really! Important features are
missing and there are lots of bugs. The code is currently
only tested on a Linux 2.4 system with a Hauppauge WinTV
video card.</p>

<p>DEVICE NAMES This backend expects device names of the
form:</p>

<p>special</p>

<p>Where special is the UNIX path-name for the special
device that corre- sponds to the v4l device. The special
device name must be a v4l device or a symlink to such a
device. For example, such a device name could be /dev/video0
or /dev/bttv0.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION The contents of the v4l.conf file is a
list of device names that corre- spond to v4l devices. Empty
lines and lines starting with a hash mark (#) are ignored. A
sample configuration file is shown below:</p>

<p>/dev/bttv0 # this is a comment /dev/video3</p>

<p>FILES /etc/sane.d/v4l.conf The backend configuration
file (see also description of SANE_CONFIG_DIR below).</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-v4l.a The static library
implementing this backend.</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-v4l.so The shared library
implementing this backend (present on systems that support
dynamic loading).</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT SANE_CONFIG_DIR This environment variable
specifies the list of directories that may contain the
configuration file. Under UNIX, the directories are
separated by a colon (:), under OS/2, they are separated by
a semi-colon (;). If this variable is not set, the config-
uration file is searched in two default directories: first,
the current working directory (&quot;.&quot;) and then in
/etc/sane.d. If the value of the environment variable ends
with the directory sepa- rator character, then the default
directories are searched after the explicitly specified
directories. For example, setting SANE_CONFIG_DIR to
&quot;/tmp/config:&quot; would result in directories
&quot;tmp/config&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and
&quot;/etc/sane.d&quot; being searched (in this order).</p>

<p>SANE_DEBUG_V4L If the library was compiled with debug
support enabled, this environment variable controls the
debug level for this backend. E.g., a value of 128 requests
all debug output to be printed. Smaller levels reduce
verbosity.</p>

<p>BUGS: If more than one video card is present, a crash
may occur. Frequency and geometry selection is missing. Send
bug reports to the SANE mailing list:
sane-devel@lists.alioth.debian.org. You must be subscribed
to the list to send mail. See
http://www.sane-project.org/mailing-lists.html for
details.</p>
