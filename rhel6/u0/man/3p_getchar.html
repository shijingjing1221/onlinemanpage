<p>GETCHAR(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual GETCHAR(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME getchar - get a byte from a stdin stream</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</p>

<p>int getchar(void);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The getchar() function shall be equivalent
to getc(stdin).</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Refer to fgetc().</p>

<p>ERRORS Refer to fgetc().</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE If the integer value returned by
getchar() is stored into a variable of type char and then
compared against the integer constant EOF, the com- parison
may never succeed, because sign-extension of a variable of
type char on widening to integer is
implementation-defined.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>

1003.1-2001, &lt;stdio.h&gt;</p>
