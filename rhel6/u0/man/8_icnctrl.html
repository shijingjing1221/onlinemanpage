<p>ICNCTRL(8) Linux System Administration ICNCTRL(8)</p>

<p>NAME icnctrl - configure ICN ISDN adaptor</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS icnctrl [-d Driver-Id] action options ...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION icnctrl is used to setup the ICN ISDN device
driver and for downloading the firmware into the ISDN
card.</p>

<p>The use of icnctrl makes sense, if you are using an ICN
card only.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -d Driver-Id selects the S0 interface named by
Driver-Id. Driver-Ids are defined during driver
initialisation. See icn(4) for a descrip- tion of the syntax
to be used for modularised and monolithic driver versions.
This option must be used to identify the S0 interface if
more than one S0 interface is existent. If a single ICN-2B
is used, it may be omitted. If using more than one card,
support for the other cards is enabled with the add action
of icnctrl. Ids may not start with digits or small x,
because these values are misinterpreted as numeric
parameters by insmod. For loading the module, always the
newest modutils package should be used to avoid problems
during load.</p>

<p>The following actions may be given to icnctrl.</p>

<p>add port [id1 [id2]] enables support for an additional
card in the driver. If id1 and id2 are missing, adds an
ICN-2B with an id given by the system. with id2 missing,
adds an ICN-2B with an Id given by the user. With both Ids
given, adds an ICN-4B with both Ids given by the user. There
is no checking against port-conflicts. Ports are checked
later during first activation while downloading the firmware
and can be changed at runtime. Ids are checked against
conflicts, and if a conflict happens, replaced by the system
in the same manner as if no Id was supplied. It is not
allowed, to add cards, after a load was done.</p>

<p>io [base-address port] sets the address of the
memory-mapped IO-region and the port- base. After loading
the icn-module into kernel-space, this com- mand should be
used as the very first setup, if the hardware settings are
different from the default settings below. If both
parameters are omitted, prints out current settings. The
default memory address is 0xD0000, the default port-base is
0x320. An ICN card uses 4 port-addresses. The memory address
is globally used for all cards (cards are mapped on demand),
while each card has its own port range. Memory range is
16k.</p>

<p>leased on|1|2|off switches between normal (dialup) and
leased-line mode. Leased- line mode is intended for usage
with S64K-lines or - if both channels are used - for S02. If
the second parameter is 1 , only one channel is enabled. If
the second parameter is 2 or on both channels are enabled.
Leased lines do not have a D-channel. When leased-line mode
is enabled, the driver simulates incoming calls using
special &quot;phone-numbers&quot; for calling and called
address which are generated as follows:</p>

<p>Calling number: LEASEDx where x is the internal
slot-number of the S0 interface. This number starts with 0
for the first S0 interface and is incremented by one for
every S0 interface configured using the add action.</p>

<p>Called number: x where x is equal to the channel number
of the calling S0 interface starting with 1.</p>

<p>load boot-code firmware [firmware2] downloads the
firmware into the card and starts operation. Using this
command, after loading the icn-module into kernel-space the
first real access to the hardware is done. Therefore the io
action above, should be used before, if the hardware
settings are different from the default settings. Usually
the images are located in @DATADIR@. The boot-code is named
loadpg.bin. The firmware depends on the D-channel protocol
of the ISDN line. For German 1TR6-lines, the firmware is
named pc_1t_ca.bin. For Euro-ISDN-lines, it is named
pc_eu_ca.bin. When loading an ICN-4B, two firmware
parameters have to be supplied. The first firmware is used
for the upper S0 connector, the second firmware is used for
the lower S0 connector (towards the cards slot con-
nector).</p>

<p>dump is available if the program is configured using the
--enable- dump option only. The contents of internal driver
variables is dumped on stdout.</p>

<p>FILES @DATADIR@/loadpg.bin This is the image of the
bootstrap loader, which is loaded first, then loads the
firmware into the cards memory and starts execution.</p>

<p>@DATADIR@/pc_1t_ca.bin This is the image of the firmware
designed for the German 1TR6 protocol.</p>

<p>@DATADIR@/pc_eu_ca.bin This is the image of the
firmware, designed for Euro ISDN.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS The following diagnostics may be issued on
stderr:</p>

<p>Read error on boot-code The file supplied as boot-code
has less than 4096 bytes length or could not be read.</p>

<p>Read error on firmware The file supplied as firmware has
less than 65536 bytes length or could not be read.</p>

<p>BUGS No bugs so far.</p>
