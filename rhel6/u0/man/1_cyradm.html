<p>NAME cyradm - Cyrus administration shell, alter ego of
Cyrus::IMAP::Shell</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS $ cyradm [--user user] [--[no]rc] [--systemrc
file] [--userrc file] &gt; [--port n] [--auth mechanism]
[--tlskey keyfile] [--notls] &gt; [--server] server</p>

<p>but possibly</p>

<p>$ perl -MCyrus::IMAP::Shell -e
&rsquo;run(&quot;myscript&quot;)&rsquo;</p>

<p>or even (not recommended)</p>

<p>use Cyrus::IMAP::Admin::Shell;</p>

<p>run(&rsquo;myscriptname&rsquo;);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This module implements cyradm in Perl. It is
a shell around Cyrus::IMAP::Admin. Commands are provided in
both Tcl-compatible forms and GNU-style long option
forms.</p>

<p>COMMANDS &quot;authenticate&quot; [&quot;--minssf&quot;
N] [&quot;--maxssf&quot; N] [&quot;--mechanisms&quot; list]
[user] &quot;auth&quot; [&quot;--minssf&quot; N]
[&quot;--maxssf&quot; N] [&quot;--mechanisms&quot; list]
[user] &quot;login&quot; [&quot;--minssf&quot; N]
[&quot;--maxssf&quot; N] [&quot;--mechanisms&quot; list]
[user] Authenticate to server. You must already be connected
to a server and Cyrus imapd will refuse to allow you to
re-authenticate once you have authenticated once.</p>

<p>&quot;chdir&quot; directory &quot;cd&quot; directory
Change directory. A &quot;pwd&quot; builtin is not provided,
but the default command action will run &quot;pwd&quot; from
a shell if invoked.</p>

<p>&quot;createmailbox&quot; [&quot;--partition&quot;
partition] mailbox &quot;createmailbox&quot; mailbox
partition &quot;create&quot; [&quot;--partition&quot;
partition] mailbox &quot;create&quot; mailbox partition
&quot;cm&quot; [&quot;--partition&quot; partition] mailbox
&quot;cm&quot; mailbox partition Create a mailbox on the
default or a specified partition. Both old-style and
getopt-style usages are accepted (combining them will
produce an error).</p>

<p>&quot;deleteaclmailbox&quot; mailbox id [...]
&quot;deleteacl&quot; mailbox id [...] &quot;dam&quot;
mailbox id [...] Remove ACLs from the specified mailbox.</p>

<p>&quot;deletemailbox&quot; mailbox &quot;delete&quot;
mailbox &quot;dm&quot; mailbox Delete the specified
mailbox.</p>

<p>Administrators do not have implicit delete rights on
mailboxes. Use the setaclmailbox command to grant the
&quot;x&quot; permission to your principal if you need to
delete a mailbox you do not own.</p>

<p>Note that the online help admits to an optional host
argument. This argument is not currently used, and will be
rejected with an error if specified; it is reserved for
IMSP.</p>

<p>&quot;disconnect&quot; &quot;disc&quot; Disconnect from
the current server. The prompt will revert to
&quot;cyradm&gt;&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;exit&quot; [number] &quot;quit&quot; [number] Exit
cyradm, optionally with a specific exit status; the exit
status of the last command will be used if one is not
specified.</p>

<p>help [command] ? [command] Show help for
&quot;command&quot; or all commands.</p>

<p>&quot;info&quot; [mailbox] Display the mailbox/server
metadata.</p>

<p>&quot;listaclmailbox&quot; mailbox &quot;listacl&quot;
mailbox &quot;lam&quot; mailbox List ACLs on the specified
mailbox.</p>

<p>&quot;listmailbox&quot; [&quot;--subscribed&quot;]
[pattern [reference]] &quot;list&quot;
[&quot;--subscribed&quot;] [pattern [reference]]
&quot;lm&quot; [&quot;--subscribed&quot;] [pattern
[reference]] List all, or all subscribed, mailboxes matching
the specified pattern. The pattern may have embedded
wildcards &rsquo;*&rsquo; or &rsquo;%&rsquo;, which match
anything or anything except the separator character,
respectively.</p>

<p>Mailboxes returned will be relative to the specified
reference if one is specified. This allows a mailbox list to
be limited to a particular hierarchy.</p>

<p>In some cases when the &rsquo;%&rsquo; wildcard is used
to end a pattern, it may match an entry which is not a
mailbox but which contains other mailboxes. In this case,
the entry will be parenthesized to indicate that it is a
root for other mailboxes, as opposed to a mailbox
itself.</p>

<p>&quot;listquota&quot; root &quot;lq&quot; root List
quotas on specified root. If the specified mailbox path does
not have a quota assigned, an error will be raised; see
listquotaroot for a way to find the quota root for a
mailbox.</p>

<p>&quot;listquotaroot&quot; mailbox &quot;lqm&quot;
mailbox &quot;lqr&quot; mailbox? show quota roots and quotas
for mailbox</p>

<p>&quot;mboxconfig&quot; mailbox attribute value
&quot;mboxcfg&quot; mailbox attribute value Set mailbox
metadata. A value of &quot;none&quot; will remove the
attribute. The currently supported attributes are:</p>

<p>&quot;comment&quot; Sets a comment or description
associated with the mailbox.</p>

<p>&quot;condstore&quot; Enables the IMAP CONDSTORE
extension (modification sequences) on the mailbox.</p>

<p>&quot;expire&quot; Sets the number of days after which
messages will be expired from the mailbox.</p>

<p>&quot;news2mail&quot; Sets an email address to which
messages injected into the server via NNTP will be sent.</p>

<p>&quot;sharedseen&quot; Enables the use of a shared n
flag on messages rather than a per-user n flag. The s right
in the mailbox ACL still controls whether a user can set the
shared n flag.</p>

<p>&quot;sieve&quot; Indicates the name of the global sieve
script that should be run when a message is delivered to the
shared mailbox (not used for personal mailboxes).</p>

<p>&quot;squat&quot; Indicates that the mailbox should have
a squat index created for it.</p>

<p>&quot;renamemailbox&quot; [&quot;--partition&quot;
partition] oldname newname &quot;rename&quot;
[&quot;--partition&quot; partition] oldname newname
&quot;renm&quot; [&quot;--partition&quot; partition] oldname
newname &quot;renamemailbox&quot; oldname newname
[partition] &quot;rename&quot; oldname newname [partition]
&quot;renm&quot; oldname newname [partition] Rename the
specified mailbox, optionally moving it to a different
partition. Both old-style and getopt-style usages are
accepted; combining them will produce an error.</p>

<p>server [--noauthenticate] [server] connect
[--noauthenticate] [server] servername [--noauthenticate]
[server] With no arguments, show the current server. With an
argument, connect to that server. It will prompt for
automatic login unless the &quot;--noauthenticate&quot;
option is specified. (This may change; in particular, either
automatic authentication will be removed or all
&quot;authenticate&quot; options will be added.)</p>

<p>When connected to a server, cyradms prompt changes from
&quot;cyradm&gt;&quot; to &quot;servername&gt;&quot;, where
servername is the fully qualified domain name of the
connected server.</p>

<p>&quot;setaclmailbox&quot; mailbox id rights [id rights
...] &quot;setacl&quot; mailbox id rights [id rights ...]
&quot;sam&quot; mailbox id rights [id rights ...] Set ACLs
on a mailbox. The ACL may be one of the special strings
&quot;none&quot;, &quot;read&quot; (&quot;lrs&quot;),
&quot;post&quot; (&quot;lrsp&quot;), &quot;append&quot;
(&quot;lrsip&quot;), &quot;write&quot;
(&quot;lrswipkxte&quot;), &quot;delete&quot;
(&quot;lrxte&quot;), or &quot;all&quot;
(&quot;lrswipkxte&quot;), or any combinations of the ACL
codes:</p>

<p>l Lookup (mailbox is visible to LIST/LSUB, SUBSCRIBE
mailbox)</p>

<p>r Read (SELECT/EXAMINE the mailbox, perform STATUS)</p>

<p>s Seen (set/clear N flag via STORE, also set N flag
during APPEND/COPY/FETCH BODY[...])</p>

<p>w Write flags other than N and TED</p>

<p>i Insert (APPEND, COPY destination)</p>

<p>p Post (send mail to mailbox)</p>

<p>k Create mailbox (CREATE new sub-mailboxes, parent for
new mailbox in RENAME)</p>

<p>x Delete mailbox (DELETE mailbox, old mailbox name in
RENAME)</p>

<p>t Delete messages (set/clear TED flag via STORE, also
set TED flag during APPEND/COPY)</p>

<p>e Perform EXPUNGE and expunge as part of CLOSE</p>

<p>a Administer (SETACL/DELETEACL/GETACL/LISTRIGHTS)</p>

<p>&quot;setinfo&quot; attribute value Set server metadata.
A value of &quot;none&quot; will remove the attribute. The
currently supported attributes are:</p>

<p>&quot;motd&quot; Sets a &quot;message of the day&quot;.
The message gets displayed as an ALERT after
authentication.</p>

<p>&quot;comment&quot; Sets a comment or description
associated with the server.</p>

<p>&quot;admin&quot; Sets the administrator email address
for the server.</p>

<p>&quot;shutdown&quot; Sets a shutdown message. The
message gets displayed as an ALERT and all users are
disconnected from the server (subsequent logins are
disallowed).</p>

<p>&quot;expire&quot; Sets the number of days after which
messages will be expired from the server (unless overridden
by a mailbox annotation).</p>

<p>&quot;squat&quot; Indicates that all mailboxes should
have a squat indexes created for them (unless overridden by
a mailbox annotation).</p>

<p>&quot;setquota&quot; root resource value [resource value
...] &quot;sq&quot; root resource value [resource value ...]
Set a quota on the specified root, which may or may not be
an actual mailbox. The only resource understood by Cyrus is
&quot;STORAGE&quot;. The value may be the special string
&quot;none&quot; which will remove the quota.</p>

<p>&quot;version&quot; &quot;ver&quot; Display the version
info of the current server.</p>

<p>&quot;xfermailbox&quot; [&quot;--partition&quot;
partition] mailbox server &quot;xfer&quot;
[&quot;--partition&quot; partition] mailbox server
&quot;xfermailbox&quot; mailbox server [partition]
&quot;xfer&quot; mailbox server [partition] Transfer
(relocate) the specified mailbox to a different server. Both
old-style and getopt-style usages are accepted; combining
them will produce an error.</p>

<p>NOTES GNU-style long options must be given in their
entirety; Tcl-style options may be abbreviated.</p>

<p>Tcl-style options are provided as a compatibility
feature. They will probably go away in the future.</p>

<p>Multiple commands can be given on a line, separated by
&rsquo;;&rsquo; characters.</p>

<p>All commands set an exit status, which at present is not
useful.</p>

<p>Unknown commands are passed to a subshell for
execution.</p>

<p>The Tcl version of cyradm is used for scripting as well
as interactively. While this is possible to a limited extent
by use of the &quot;run&quot; method, scripting would
normally be done with &quot;Cyrus::IMAP::Admin&quot;, which
is far more flexible than either interactive
&quot;cyradm&quot; or the Tcl scripting mechanism for
Cyrus.</p>

<p>cyradm understands /bin/sh-style redirection: any
command can have its standard or error output redirected,
with all sh-style redirections (except &quot;&lt;&gt;&quot;)
supported. It does not currently understand pipes or
backgrounding.</p>

<p>If the &quot;Term::Readline::Perl&quot; or
&quot;Term::Readline::GNU&quot; modules are available,
cyradm will use it.</p>

<p>An alias facility is implemented internally, but no
access is currently provided to it. This will change, if
only to allow some of the predefined aliases to be removed
if they conflict with useful shell commands.</p>
