<p>EFAX(1) EFAX(1)</p>

<p>NAME efax - send/receive faxes with Class 1, 2 or 2.0
fax modem</p>

<p>(Please read the fax man page first.)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS efax [ options ] [ -t num [ file... ] ]</p>

<p>OPTIONS Where options are:</p>

<p>-a cmd use the command ATcmd when answering the phone.
The default is &quot;A&quot;.</p>

<p>-c caps set the local modem capabilities. See the
section on capabil- ities below for the format and meaning
of caps. For Class 1 the default is 1,n,0,2,0,0,0,0 where n
is the highest speed supported by the modem. For Class 2 the
default is determined by the modem.</p>

<p>-d dev use the fax modem connected to device dev. The
default is /dev/modem.</p>

<p>-f fnt use font file fnt for generating the header. The
default is a built-in 8x16 font. See the efix(1) -f option
for the font file format.</p>

<p>-g cmd if a CONNECT (or DATA) response indicates a data
call, the shell /bin/sh is exec(2) ed with cmd as its
command. cmd is a printf(3) format that may contain up to 6
%d escapes which are replaced by the baud rate following the
most recent CONNECT message. cmd typically execs
getty(8).</p>

<p>-h hdr put string hdr at the top of each page. The first
%d in hdr is replaced by the page number and the second, if
any, is replaced by the number of pages being sent.</p>

<p>-i str</p>

<p>-j str</p>

<p>-k str send the command ATstr to the modem to initialize
it. -i com- mands are sent before the modem is put into fax
mode, -j com- mands after the modem is in fax mode, and -k
commands just before efax exits. The only default is a
hang-up (ATH) com- mand that is sent before exiting only if
no other -k options are given. Multiple options may be
used.</p>

<p>-l id set the local identification string to id. id
should be the local telephone number in international format
(for example &quot;+1 800 555 1212&quot;). This is passed to
the remote fax machine. Some fax machines may not accept
characters other than num- bers, space, and +.</p>

<p>-o opt use option opt to accommodate a non-standard fax
modem proto- col. See the MODEM REQUIREMENTS section below
for more details. The options are:</p>

<p>0 Force use of Class 2.0 fax modem commands. The modem
must support Class 2.0.</p>

<p>2 Force use of Class 2 fax modem commands. The modem
must sup- port Class 2.</p>

<p>1 Force use of Class 1 fax modem commands. The modem
must sup- port Class 1. By default efax queries the modem
and uses the first of the three above classes which is
supported by the modem.</p>

<p>a use software adaptive answer method. If the first
attempt to answer the call does not result in a data
connection within 8 seconds the phone is hung up temporarily
and answered again in fax mode (see &quot;Accepting both fax
and data calls&quot; below).</p>

<p>e ignore errors in modem initialization commands.</p>

<p>f use &quot;virtual flow control&quot;. efax tries to
estimate the number of bytes in the modem s transmit buffer
and pauses as neces- sary to avoid filling it. The modems
buffer is assumed to hold at least 96 bytes. This feature
does not work properly with Class 2 modems that add
redundant padding to scan lines. Use this option only if you
have problems configuring flow control.</p>

<p>h use hardware (RTS/CTS) in addition to software
(XON/XOFF) flow control. Many modems will stop responding if
this option is used. See the section Resolving Problems
before using this option.</p>

<p>l halve the time between testing lock files when waiting
for other programs to complete. By default this is 8
seconds. For example -olll sets the interval to 1
second.</p>

<p>n ignore requests for pages to be retransmitted. Use
this option if you don t care about the quality of the
received fax or if the receiving machine is too fussy.
Otherwise each page may be retransmitted up to 3 times.</p>

<p>r do not reverse bit order during data reception for
Class 2 modems. Only Multitech modems require this option.
Not nor- mally required since efax detects these modems.</p>

<p>x send XON (DC1) instead of DC2 to start data reception.
Applies to a very few Class 2 modems only.</p>

<p>z delay an additional 100 milliseconds before each modem
ini- tialization or reset command. The initial delay is 100
ms. For example, -ozzz produces a 400 ms delay. Use with
modems that get confused when commands arrive too
quickly.</p>

<p>-q n ask for retransmission of pages received with more
than n errors. Default is 10.</p>

<p>-r pat each received fax page is stored in a separate
file. The file name is created using pat as a strftime(3)
format string. A page number of the form .001, .002, ... is
appended to the file name. If pat is blank (&quot;&quot;) or
no -r option is given a default string of
&quot;%m%d%H%M%S&quot; is used.</p>

<p>-s remove lock file(s) after initializing the modem.
This allows outgoing calls to proceed when efax is waiting
for an incoming call. If efax detects modem activity it will
attempt to re- lock the device. If the modem has been locked
by the other program efax will exit and return 1 (busy).
Normally a new efax process is then started by init(8). The
new efax pro- cess will then check periodically until the
lock file disap- pears and then re-initialize the modem.</p>

<p>-t num [file...] dial telephone number num and send the
fax image files file.... If used, this must be the last
argument on the com- mand line. The telephone number num is
a string that may con- tain any dial modifiers that the
modem supports such as a T prefix for tone dialing or commas
for delays. If no file names are given the remote fax
machine will be polled. If no -t argument is given efax will
answer the phone and attempt to receive a fax.</p>

<p>-v strng select types of messages to be printed. Each
lower-case let- ter in strng enables one type of
message:</p>

<p>e - errors w - warnings i - session progress information
n - capability negotiation information c - modem (AT)
commands and responses h - HDLC frame data (Class 1 only) m
- modem output a - program arguments r - reception error
details t - transmission details f - image file details x -
lock file processing</p>

<p>Up to two -v options may be used. The first is for
messages printed to the standard error and the second is for
messages to the standard output. The default is
&quot;ewin&quot; to the standard error only.</p>

<p>-w wait for an OK or CONNECT prompt instead of issuing
an answer (ATA) command to receive a fax. Use this option
when the modem is set to auto-answer (using S0=n) or if
another program has already answered the call.</p>

<p>-x lkf use a UUCP-style lock file lkf to lock the modem
device before opening it. If the device is locked, efax
checks every 15 seconds until it is free. Up to 16 -x
options may be used if there are several names for the same
device. A # prefix on the file name creates an binary rather
than text (HDB-style) lock file. This is the reverse of what
was used by previous efax versions.</p>

<p>FAX FILE FORMATS efax can read the same types of files
as efix(1) including text, T.4 (Group 3), PBM, single- and
multi-page TIFF (G3 and uncompressed). efax automatically
determines the type of file from its contents. TIFF files
are recommended as they contain information about the image
size and resolution.</p>

<p>Each page to be sent should be converted to a separate
TIFF format file with Group 3 (G3) compression. Received
files are also stored in this format. The EXAMPLES section
below shows how efix and other programs can be used to
create, view and print these files.</p>

<p>OPERATING SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS The operating system must
provide short response times to avoid proto- col timeouts.
For Class 2 and 2.0 modems the delay should not exceed 1 or
2 seconds.</p>

<p>When using Class 1 modems the program must respond to
certain events within 55 milliseconds. Longer delays may
cause the fax protocol to fail in certain places (between
DCS and TCF or between RTC and MPS). Class 1 modems should
therefore not be used on systems that cannot guarantee that
the program will respond to incoming data in less than 55
milliseconds. In particular, some intelligent serial cards
and ter- minal servers may introduce enough delay to cause
problems with Class 1 operation.</p>

<p>The operating system must also provide sufficient
low-level buffering to allow uninterrupted transfer of data
between the modem and a disk file at the selected baud rate,
typically 9600 bps. Since the fax pro- tocol does not
provide end-to-end flow control the effectiveness of flow
control while receiving is limited by the size of the modems
buffer. This can be less than 100 bytes. Efax does not use
flow con- trol during reception.</p>

<p>MODEM REQUIREMENTS The &quot;Group&quot; is the protocol
used to send faxes between fax machines. Efax supports the
Group 3 protocol used over the public telephone net-
work.</p>

<p>The &quot;Class&quot; is the protocol used by computers
to control fax modems. Efax supports Class 1, 2 and 2.0 fax
modems.</p>

<p>Most fax modems use XON/XOFF flow control when in fax
mode. This type of flow control adds very little overhead
for fax use. Many modems have unreliable hardware (RTS/CTS)
flow control in fax mode. By default efax enables only
XON/XOFF flow control and the -oh option must be used to add
hardware flow control.</p>

<p>While some modems have serial buffers of about 1k bytes,
many inexpen- sive modems have buffers of about one hundred
bytes and are thus more likely to suffer overruns when
sending faxes.</p>

<p>A few older modems may need a delay between commands of
more than the default value used by efax (100 milliseconds).
If the delay is too short, commands may not echo properly,
may time out, or may give incon- sistent responses. Use one
or more -oz options to increase the delay between modem
initialization commands and use the E0 modem initializa-
tion command to disable echoing of modem commands.</p>

<p>By default efax sends DC2 to start the data flow from
the modem when receiving faxes from Class 2 modems. A few
older modems require XON instead. Use of DC2 would cause the
modem to give an error message and/or the program to time
out. The -ox option should be used in this case.</p>

<p>A few older Class 2 modems (e.g. some Intel models) don
t send DC2 or XON to start the data flow to the modem when
sending faxes. After waiting 2 seconds efax will print a
warning and start sending anyways.</p>

<p>A very few Class 2 modems do not reverse the bit order
(MSB to LSB) by default on receive. This might cause errors
when trying to display or print the received files. The -or
option can be used in this case.</p>

<p>Some inexpensive &quot;9600 bps&quot; fax modems only
transmit at 9600 bps and reception is limited to 4800
bps.</p>

<p>MODEM INITIALIZATION OPTIONS The required modem
initialization commands are generated by efax. Additional
commands may be supplied as command-line arguments. The
modem must be set up to issue verbose(text) result codes.
The follow- ing command does this and is sent by efax before
trying to initialize the modem.</p>

<p>Q0V1 respond to commands with verbose result codes</p>

<p>The following commands may be useful for special
purposes:</p>

<p>X3 dont wait for dial tone before dialing. This may be
used to send a fax when the call has already been dialed
manually. In this case use an empty string (&quot;&quot;) as
the first argument to the -t command. Use X4 (usual default)
to enable all result codes.</p>

<p>M2 leave the monitor speaker turned on for the duration
of the call (use M0 to leave it off).</p>

<p>L0 turn monitor speaker volume to minimum (use L3 for
maximum).</p>

<p>E0 disable echoing of modem commands. See the Resolving
Problems section below.</p>

<p>&amp;D2 returns the modem to command mode when DTR is
dropped. The program drops DTR at the start and end of the
call if it cant get a response to a modem command. You can
use &amp;D3 to reset the modem when DTR is dropped.</p>

<p>S7=120 wait up to two minutes (120 seconds) for carrier.
This may be useful if the answering fax machine takes a long
time to start the handshaking operation (e.g. a combined
fax/answering machine with a long announcement).</p>

<p>CAPABILITIES The capabilities of the local hardware and
software can be set using a string of 8 digits separated by
commas:</p>

<p>vr,br,wd,ln,df,ec,bf,st</p>

<p>where:</p>

<p>vr (vertical resolution) = 0 for 98 lines per inch 1 for
196 lpi</p>

<p>br (bit rate) = 0 for 2400 bps 1 for 4800 2 for 7200 3
for 9600 4 for 12000 (V.17) 5 for 14400 (V.17)</p>

<p>wd (width) = 0 for 8.5&quot; (21.5 cm) page width 1 for
10&quot; (25.5 cm) 2 for 12&quot; (30.3 cm)</p>

<p>ln (length) = 0 for 11&quot; (A4: 29.7 cm) page length 1
for 14&quot; (B4: 36.4 cm) 2 for unlimited page length</p>

<p>df (data format) = 0 for 1-D coding 1 for 2-D coding
(not supported)</p>

<p>ec (error correction) = 0 for no error correction</p>

<p>bf (binary file) = 0 for no binary file transfer</p>

<p>st (minimum scan time) = 0 for zero delay per line 1 for
5 ms per line 3 for 10 ms per line 5 for 20 ms per line 7
for 40 ms per line</p>

<p>When receiving a fax the vr, wd, and ln fields of the
capability string should be set to the maximum values that
your display software sup- ports. The default is 196 lpi,
standard (8.5&quot;/21.5cm) width and unlim- ited
length.</p>

<p>When sending a fax efax will determine vr and ln from
the image file and set wd to the default.</p>

<p>If the receiving fax machine does not support high
resolution (vr=1) mode, efax will reduce the resolution by
combining pairs of scan lines. If the receiving fax machine
does not support the image s width then efax will truncate
or pad as required. Most fax machines can receive ln up to
2. Few machines support values of wd other than 0.</p>

<p>HEADERS efax adds blank scan lines at the top of each
image when it is sent. This allows room for the page header
but increases the length of the image (by default about
0.1&quot; or 2.5mm of blank space is added).</p>

<p>The header placed in this area typically includes the
date and time, identifies the, and shows the page number and
total pages. Headers cannot be disabled but the header
string can be set to a blank line.</p>

<p>The default font for generating the headers is the
built-in 8x16 pixel font scaled to 12x24 pixels (about 9
point size).</p>

<p>Note that both efax and efix have -f options to specify
the font. efIx uses the font to generate text when doing
text-to-fax conversions (dur- ing &quot;fax make&quot;)
while efAx uses the font to generate the header (during
&quot;fax send&quot;).</p>

<p>SESSION LOG A session log is written to the standard
error stream. This log gives status and error messages from
the program as selected by the -v option. A time stamp
showing the full time or just minutes and seconds is printed
before each message. Times printed along with modem
responses also show milliseconds.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUES The program returns an error code as
follows:</p>

<p>0 The fax was successfully sent or received.</p>

<p>1 The dialed number was busy or the modem device was in
use. Try again later.</p>

<p>2 Something failed (e.g. file not found or disk full).
Dont retry. Check the session log for more details.</p>

<p>3 Modem protocol error. The program did not receive the
expected response from the modem. The modem may not have
been properly initialized, the correct -o options were not
used, or a bug report may be in order. Check the session log
for more details.</p>

<p>4 The modem is not responding. Operator attention is
required. Check that the modem is turned on and connected to
the correct port.</p>

<p>5 The program was terminated by a signal.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Creating fax (G3) files</p>

<p>The efix program can be used to convert text files to
TIFF-G3 format. For example, the following command will
convert the text file letter to the files letter.001,
letter.002, etc,:</p>

<p>efix -nletter.%03d letter</p>

<p>Ghostscript s tiffg3 driver can generate fax files in
TIFF-G3 format from postscript files. For example, the
command:</p>

<p>gs -q -sDEVICE=tiffg3 -dNOPAUSE -sOutputFile=letter.%03d
letter.ps &lt;/dev/null</p>

<p>will convert the Postscript file letter.ps into
high-resolution (vr=1) G3 fax image files letter.001,
letter.002, ...</p>

<p>The images should have margins of at least 1/2 inch (1
cm) since the fax standard only requires that fax machines
print a central portion of the image 196.6mm (7.7 inches)
wide by 281.5mm (11.1 inches) high.</p>

<p>The efix program can also insert bitmaps in images to
create letter- head, signatures, etc.</p>

<p>Printing fax files</p>

<p>You can use the efix program to print faxes on
Postscript or HP-PCL (LaserJet) printers. For example, to
print the received fax file reply.001 on a Postscript
printer use the command:</p>

<p>efix -ops reply.001 | lpr</p>

<p>Sending fax files</p>

<p>The following command will dial the number 222-2222
using tone dialing and send a two-page fax from the TIFF-G3
files letter.001 and let- ter.002 using the fax modem
connected to device /dev/cua1.</p>

<p>efax -d /dev/cua1 -t T222-2222 letter.001 letter.002</p>

<p>Manual answer</p>

<p>You can use efax to answer the phone immediately and
start fax recep- tion. Use this mode if you need to answer
calls manually to see if they are fax or voice.</p>

<p>For example, the following command will make the fax
modem on device /dev/ttyS1 answer the phone and attempt to
receive a fax. The received fax will be stored in the files
reply.001, reply.002, and so on. The modem will identify
itself as &quot;555 1212&quot; and receive faxes at high or
low resolution (vr=1), at up to 14.4 kbps (br=5).</p>

<p>efax -d /dev/ttyS1 -l &quot;555 1212&quot; -c 1,5 -r
reply</p>

<p>Automatic answer</p>

<p>The -w option makes efax wait for characters to become
available from the modem (indicating an incoming call)
before starting fax reception. Use the -w option and a
-iS0=n option to answer the phone after n rings. The example
below will make the modem answer incoming calls in fax mode
on the fourth ring and save the received faxes using files
names corresponding to the reception date and time.</p>

<p>efax -d /dev/ttyb -w -iS0=4 2&gt;&amp;1 &gt;&gt;
fax.log</p>

<p>Sharing the modem with outgoing calls</p>

<p>The modem device can be shared by programs that use the
UUCP device locking protocol. This includes pppd, chat,
minicom, kermit, uucico, efax, cu, and many others others.
However, locking will only work if all programs use the same
lock file.</p>

<p>efax will lock the modem device before opening it if one
or more UUCP lock file names are given with -x options. Most
programs place their lock files in the /usr/spool/uucp or
/var/lock directories and use the name LCK..dev where dev is
the name of the device file in the /dev directory that is to
be locked.</p>

<p>If the -s (share) option is used, the lock file is
removed while wait- ing for incoming calls so other programs
can use the same device.</p>

<p>If efax detects another program using the modem while it
is waiting to receive a fax, efax exits with a termination
code of 1. A subsequent efax process using this device will
wait until the other program is finished before
re-initializing the modem and starting to wait for incoming
calls again.</p>

<p>Programs that try to lock the modem device by using
device locking facilities other than UUCP lock files not be
able to use this arbitra- tion mechanism because the device
will still be open to the efax pro- cess. In this case you
will need to kill the efax process (e.g. &quot;fax
stop&quot;) before starting the other program.</p>

<p>When efax is waiting for a fax it leaves the modem ready
to receive in fax mode but removes the lock file. When a
slip or PPP program takes over the modem port by setting up
its own lock file efax cannot send any more commands to the
modem -- not even to reset it. Therefore the other program
has to set the modem back to data mode when it starts up. To
do this add a modem reset command (send ATZ expect OK) to
the begin- ning of your slip or PPP chat script.</p>

<p>Accepting both fax and data calls</p>

<p>Many modems have an adaptive data/fax answer mode that
can be enabled using the -j+FAE=1 (for Class 1) or -jFAA=1
(for Class 2[.0]) initial- ization string. The type of call
(data or fax) can then be deduced from the modems
responses.</p>

<p>Some modems have limited adaptive answer features (e.g.
only working properly at certain baud rates or only in Class
2) or none at all. In this case use the initialization
string -i+FCLASS=0 to answer in data mode first and the -oa
option to then hang up and try again in fax mode if the
first answer attempt was not successful. This method only
works if your telephone system waits a few seconds after you
hang up before disconnecting incoming calls.</p>

<p>If the -g option is used then the options argument will
be run as a shell command when an incoming data call is
detected. Typically this command will exec getty(8). This
program should expect to find the modem already off-hook and
a lock file present so it should not try to hang up the line
or create a lock file. Note that the modem should be set up
to report the DCE-DTE (modem-computer, e.g. CONNECT 38400)
speed, not the DCE-DCE (modem-modem, e.g. CONNECT 14400)
speed. For many modems the initialization option -iW0 will
set this.</p>

<p>The following command will make efax answer incoming
calls on /dev/cua1 on the second ring. This device will be
locked using two different lock files but these lock files
will be removed while waiting for incoming calls (-s). If a
data call is detected, the getty program will be run to
initialize the terminal driver and start a login(1) pro-
cess. Received fax files will be stored using names like
Dec02-12.32.33.001, in the /usr/spool/fax/incoming directory
and the log file will be appended to
/usr/spool/fax/faxlog.cua1.</p>

<p>efax -d /dev/cua1 -j +FAA=1 -x /usr/spool/uucp/LCK..cua1
-x /usr/spool/uucp/LCK..ttyS1 -g &quot;exec /sbin/getty -h
/dev/cua1 %d&quot; -iS0=2 -w -s -r
&quot;/usr/spool/fax/incoming/%b%d-%H.%I.%S&quot; &gt;&gt;
/usr/spool/fax/faxlog.cua1 2&gt;&amp;1</p>

<p>Note that adaptive answer of either type will not work
for all callers. For some data calls the duration of the
initial data-mode answer may be too short for data
handshaking to complete. In other cases this dura- tion may
be so long that incoming fax calls will time out before efax
switches to fax mode. In addition, some calling fax modems
mistake data-mode answering tones for fax signaling tones
and initiate fax negotiation too soon. If you use software
adaptive answer you can reduce the value of the initial
data-mode answer (set by TO_DATAF in efax.c) to get more
reliable fax handshaking or increase it for more reliable
data handshaking. However, if you need to provide reliable
fax and data service to all callers you should use separate
phone num- bers for the two types of calls.</p>

<p>When a call is answered the modem goes on-line with the
computer-to- modem baud rate fixed at the speed used for the
most recent AT command. When efax is waiting for a fax or
data call it sets the interface speed to 19200 bps since
this is the speed required for fax operation. This prevents
full use of 28.8kbps modem capabilities.</p>

<p>USING INIT TO RUN EFAX efax can answer all incoming
calls if you place an entry for efax in /etc/inittab (for
SysV-like systems) or /etc/ttytab (for BSD-like sys- tems).
The init(8) process will run a new copy of efax when the
system boots up and whenever the previous efax process
terminates. The init- tab or ttytab entry should invoke efax
by running the fax script with an answer argument.</p>

<p>For example, placing the following line in /etc/inittab
(and running &quot;kill -1 1&quot;) will make init run the
fax script with the argument answer every time previous
process terminates and init is in runlevel 4 or 5.</p>

<p>s1:45:respawn:/bin/sh /usr/bin/fax answer</p>

<p>For BSD-like systems (e.g. SunOS), a line such as the
following in /etc/ttytab will have the same effect:</p>

<p>ttya &quot;/usr/local/bin/fax answer&quot; unknown
on</p>

<p>You should protect the fax script and configuration
files against tam- pering since init will execute them as a
privileged (root) process. If you will be allowing data
calls via getty and login you should ensure that your system
is reasonably secure (e.g. that all user ids have secure
passwords).</p>

<p>If efax exec()s getty properly but you get a garbled
login prompt then there is probably a baud rate mismatch
between the modem and the com- puter. First, check the efax
log file to make sure the modems CONNECT response reported
the serial port speed (e.g. 19200), not the modem- modem
speed (e.g. 14400). Next, check the getty options and/or
config- uration files (e.g. /etc/gettydefs) for that
particular baud rate. Then run getty manually with the same
arguments and verify the port settings using stty
&lt;/dev/XXX. Note that youll probably want to enable
hardware flow control for data connections (-h for agetty,
CRTSCTS for getty_ps).</p>

<p>A few programs wont work properly when efax is set up to
answer calls because they dont create lock files. You can
put the shell script wrapper below around such programs to
make them work properly. Change BIN and LOCKF to suit.</p>

<p>#!/bin/sh BIN=/bin/badprogram
LOCKF=/var/spool/uucp/LCK..cua1 if [ -f $LOCKF ] then echo
lock file $LOCKF exists exit 1 else printf &quot;%10d0 $$
&gt;$LOCKF $BIN $* rm $LOCKF fi</p>

<p>DELIVERING RECEIVED FAXES BY E-MAIL The &quot;fax
answer&quot; script described above can be configured to
e-mail the fax files received by the previous fax answer
process to a &quot;fax man- ager&quot; who can then forward
the fax to the correct recipient. The received fax files are
send as MIME attachments, one file per page, using the
base64 text encoding and the image/tiff file format.</p>

<p>To view the fax images directly from your e-mail reader
you will have to configure it with an application that can
display files of type image/tiff. Typically this is
specified in a mailcap file. For example, placing the
following line in /etc/mailcap will cause the fax file
attachments to be displayed using the fax view command.</p>

<p>image/tiff; fax view %s</p>

<p>SENDING FAXES USING THE PRINT SPOOLER You can configure
a &quot;fax&quot; printer into the lpr print spooler that
will fax a document out using efax instead of printing it.
This allows a network server running efax to send faxes on
behalf of other machines, including non-Unix clients. In the
following steps use the directories specified in the fax
script if they are different than /usr/bin and
/var/spool/fax (FAXDIR). To set up a fax printer do the
following as root:</p>

<p>(1) Create a link to the fax script called faxlpr so the
fax script can determine when it is being invoked from the
print spooler:</p>

<p>ln -s /usr/bin/fax /usr/bin/faxlpr</p>

<p>(2) Edit /etc/printcap and add an entry such as:</p>


<p>fax:lp=/dev/null:sd=/var/spool/fax:if=/usr/bin/faxlpr:</p>

<p>to define a printer called &quot;fax&quot;. Print files
will be spooled to the /var/spool/fax (sd=) directory and
then piped to the /usr/bin/faxlpr filter (if=). Error
messages will appear on /dev/console.</p>

<p>(3) Create and/or set the permissions to allow anyone to
read and write in the fax spool directory. For example:</p>

<p>mkdir /var/spool/fax chmod 777 /var/spool/fax</p>

<p>(4) Create a printer daemon lock file that is readable
by anyone:</p>

<p>touch /var/spool/fax/lock chmod 644
/var/spool/fax/lock</p>

<p>You should now be able to send a fax using the lpr
interface by using a command such as:</p>

<p>lpr -P fax -J &quot;555 1212&quot; file.ps</p>

<p>where the -J option is used to specify the phone number
or alias to be dialed.</p>

<p>Note that if more than one file is given on the command
line they will be concatenated before being passed to
&quot;fax send&quot;. TIFF-G3, Postscript or PBM files must
therefore be sent one file at a time although TIFF and
Postscript files may contain multiple pages. Only multiple
text files can be sent in one command. Page breaks in text
files can be marked with form-feed characters. Files will be
converted and sent at the default (high) resolution.</p>

<p>You can use lpq(1) to check the fax queue, lprm(1) to
remove fax jobs and lpc(8) to control the spooler. In each
case use the -Pfax option to specify the fax printer. A log
file will be mailed to the user when the fax is sent.</p>

<p>You should also be able to send a fax from any networked
computer that has lpr-compatible remote printing software
and that allows you to set the job name (-J option) to an
arbitrary string. Such software is available for most
computers.</p>

<p>See the lpd(8) and printcap(5) man pages for information
on the print spooler and for restricting access by host name
(/etc/host.lpd) or by user group (the rg printcap
entry).</p>

<p>RESOLVING PROBLEMS Double check the configuration setup
in the first part of the fax script, particularly the modem
device name and the lock file names.</p>

<p>If efax hangs when trying to open the modem device
(typically /dev/ttyX), the device is either already in use
by another process (e.g. pppd) or it requires the carrier
detect line to be true before it can be opened. Many systems
define an alternate device name for the same physical device
(typically cuaX) that can be opened even if carrier is not
present or other programs are already using it.</p>

<p>If responses to modem initialization commands are being
lost or gener- ated at random, another processes (e.g. getty
or an efax auto-answer process) may be trying to use the
modem at the same time. Try running efax while this other
program is running. If efax does not report &quot;/dev/ttyX
locked or busy. waiting.&quot; then the lock files names are
not specified correctly.</p>

<p>Attempt to send a fax. Check that the modem starts
making the calling signal (CNG, a 0.5 second beep every 3
seconds) as soon as its fin- ished dialing. This shows the
modem is in fax mode. You may need to set the SPKR variable
to -iM2L3 to monitor the phone line to do this.</p>

<p>Listen for the answering fax machine and check that it
sends the answer signal (CED, a 3 second beep) followed by
&quot;warbling&quot; sounds (DIS frames) every 3 seconds. If
you hear a continuous sound (tones or noise) instead, then
you ve connected to a data modem instead.</p>

<p>Your modem should send back its own warble (DCS frame)
in response to DIS immediately followed by 1.5 seconds of
noise (a channel check). If everything is OK, the receiving
end will send another warble (CFR frame) and your modem will
start to send data. If you have an external modem, check its
LEDs. If flow control is working properly the modems send
data (SD) LED will turn off periodically while the fax data
is sent.</p>

<p>Check the message showing the line count and the average
bit rate when the page transmission is done. Low line counts
(under 1000 for a let- ter size image) or the warning
&quot;fax output buffer overflow&quot; while send- ing
indicate that the image data format is incorrect. Check the
file being sent using the &quot;fax view&quot; command.</p>

<p>If you get the error message flow control did not work
then flow control was not active. This usually results in a
garbled transmission and the receiving machine may reject
the page, abort the call, print a distorted or blank image
and/or hang up.</p>

<p>The warning &quot;characters received while
sending&quot; or an &lt;XOFF&gt; character appearing after
the transmission means that the operating system ignored the
modems XOFF flow control character. Ensure that you are not
running other programs such as getty or pppd at the same
time as efax since they will turn off xon/xoff flow
control.</p>

<p>If you cannot get flow control to work properly then
enable virtual flow control with the -of option or hardware
flow control with the -oh option.</p>

<p>Check that the remote machine confirms reception with a
+FPTS:1 response (Class 2) or an MCF frame (Class 1).</p>

<p>For Class 2 modems, the error message &quot;abnormal
call termination (code nn)&quot; indicates that the modem
detected an error and hung up.</p>

<p>Many companies advertise services that will fax back
information on their products. These can be useful for
testing fax reception.</p>

<p>The message &quot;run length buffer overflow&quot; when
receiving indicates an error with the image data format. You
may need to use the -or option with certain Class 2
modems.</p>

<p>If efax displays the message &quot;cant happen
(&lt;details&gt;)&quot; please send a bug report to the
author.</p>

<p>Finally, dont play &quot;option bingo,&quot; if you cant
resolve the problem send a verbose log of the failed session
(the output from fax -v ...) to the address below.</p>

<p>Other Ports</p>

<p>efax is relatively easy to port. All system-dependent
code is in efaxos.c. An early version of efax was ported to
VMS. Version 0.8a was ported to Win32 by Luigi Capriotti.
Contact the author if you would like to integrate the Win32
code into the current version.</p>
