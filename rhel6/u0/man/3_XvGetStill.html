drawable</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;X11/extensions/Xvlib.h&gt;</p>

<p>int XvGetStill(Display *dpy, XvPortID port, Drawable d,
GC gc, int vx, int vy, unsigned int vw, unsigned int vh, int
dx, int dy, unsigned int dw, unsigned int dh);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS dpy Specifies the connection to the X
server.</p>

<p>port Defines the port to which the still is output.</p>

<p>d Defines the drawable from which the still is to be
cap- tured. Pixmaps are currently not supported.</p>

<p>gc Defines the graphical context. GC components are:
sub- window-mode, clip-x-origin, clip-y-origin, and clip-
mask.</p>

<p>vx,vy,vw,vh Define the location and size of the
destination video region into which the still is to be
written. vx and vy define the xand y coordinates of the
upper-left corner of the video region; vwand vh define the
width and height, in pixels, of the video region.</p>

<p>dx,dy,dw,dh Define the location and size of the source
drawable from which the still image is to be captured. dxand
dy define the xand y coordinates of the upper-left corner of
the drawable region; dwand dh define the width and height,
in pixels, of the drawable region.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION captures a single frame of video from a
drawable. The position and size of the destination (video)
rectangle is specified by vx, vy, vw, and vh. The position
and size of the source (drawable) rectangle is specified by
dx, dy, dw, and dh.</p>

<p>Drawable data is clipped to the bounds of the drawable,
scaled to the requested video region size (or the closest
size supported) and clipped to the bounds of the video
encoding. The contents of any region not updated with
drawable data is undefined.</p>

<p>If the port is grabbed by another client, this request
is ignored, and an XvVideoNotify event with detail XvBusy is
generated for the draw- able.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUES [Success] Returned if XvGetStill(3)
completed successfully.</p>

<p>[XvBadExtension] Returned if the Xv extension is
unavailable.</p>

<p>[XvBadAlloc] Returned if XvGetStill(3) failed to
allocate memory to process the request.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS [XvBadPort] Generated if the requested port
does not exist.</p>

<p>[BadDrawable] Generated if the requested drawable does
not exist.</p>

<p>[BadGC] Generated if the requested graphics context does
not exist.</p>

<p>[BadAlloc] Generated if there were insufficient
resources to process the request.</p>
