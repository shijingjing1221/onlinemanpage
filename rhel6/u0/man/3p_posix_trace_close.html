<p>POSIX_TRACE_CLOSE(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
POSIX_TRACE_CLOSE(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME posix_trace_close, posix_trace_open,
posix_trace_rewind - trace log management (TRACING)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;trace.h&gt;</p>

<p>int posix_trace_close(trace_id_t trid); int
posix_trace_open(int file_desc, trace_id_t *trid); int
posix_trace_rewind(trace_id_t trid);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The posix_trace_close() function shall
deallocate the trace log identi- fier indicated by trid, and
all of its associated resources. If there is no valid trace
log pointed to by the trid, this function shall fail.</p>

<p>The posix_trace_open() function shall allocate the
necessary resources and establish the connection between a
trace log identified by the file_desc argument and a trace
stream identifier identified by the object pointed to by the
trid argument. The file_desc argument should be a valid open
file descriptor that corresponds to a trace log. The
file_desc argument shall be open for reading. The current
trace event timestamp, which specifies the timestamp of the
trace event that will be read by the next call to
posix_trace_getnext_event(), shall be set to the timestamp
of the oldest trace event recorded in the trace log
identified by trid.</p>

<p>The posix_trace_open() function shall return a trace
stream identifier in the variable pointed to by the trid
argument, that may only be used by the following
functions:</p>

<p>posix_trace_close() posix_trace_get_attr()
posix_trace_eventid_equal() posix_trace_get_status()
posix_trace_eventid_get_name() posix_trace_getnext_event()
posix_trace_eventtypelist_getnext_id() posix_trace_rewind()
posix_trace_eventtypelist_rewind()</p>

<p>In particular, notice that the operations normally used
by a trace con- troller process, such as
posix_trace_start(), posix_trace_stop(), or
posix_trace_shutdown(), cannot be invoked using the trace
stream iden- tifier returned by the posix_trace_open()
function.</p>

<p>The posix_trace_rewind() function shall reset the
current trace event timestamp, which specifies the timestamp
of the trace event that will be read by the next call to
posix_trace_getnext_event(), to the times- tamp of the
oldest trace event recorded in the trace log identified by
trid.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, these functions
shall return a value of zero. Otherwise, they shall return
the corresponding error number.</p>

<p>If successful, the posix_trace_open() function stores
the trace stream identifier value in the object pointed to
by trid.</p>

<p>ERRORS The posix_trace_open() function shall fail
if:</p>

<p>EINTR The operation was interrupted by a signal and thus
no trace log was opened.</p>

<p>EINVAL The object pointed to by file_desc does not
correspond to a valid trace log.</p>

<p>The posix_trace_close() and posix_trace_rewind()
functions may fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The object pointed to by trid does not correspond
to a valid trace log.</p>
