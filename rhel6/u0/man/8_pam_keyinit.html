<p>PAM_KEYINIT(8) Linux-PAM Manual PAM_KEYINIT(8)</p>

<p>NAME pam_keyinit - Kernel session keyring initialiser
module</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pam_keyinit.so [debug] [force] [revoke]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pam_keyinit PAM module ensures that the
invoking process has a session keyring other than the user
default session keyring.</p>

<p>The session component of the module checks to see if the
process&acute;s session keyring is the user default, and, if
it is, creates a new anonymous session keyring with which to
replace it.</p>

<p>If a new session keyring is created, it will install a
link to the user common keyring in the session keyring so
that keys common to the user will be automatically
accessible through it.</p>

<p>The session keyring of the invoking process will
thenceforth be inherited by all its children unless they
override it.</p>

<p>This module is intended primarily for use by login
processes. Be aware that after the session keyring has been
replaced, the old session keyring and the keys it contains
will no longer be accessible.</p>

<p>This module should not, generally, be invoked by
programs like su, since it is usually desirable for the key
set to percolate through to the alternate context. The keys
have their own permissions system to manage this.</p>

<p>This module should be included as early as possible in a
PAM configuration, so that other PAM modules can attach
tokens to the keyring.</p>

<p>The keyutils package is used to manipulate keys more
directly. This can be obtained from:</p>

<p>Keyutils [1]</p>

<p>OPTIONS debug Log debug information with syslog(3).</p>

<p>force Causes the session keyring of the invoking process
to be replaced unconditionally.</p>

<p>revoke Causes the session keyring of the invoking
process to be revoked when the invoking process exits if the
session keyring was created for this process in the first
place.</p>

<p>MODULE TYPES PROVIDED Only the session module type is
provided.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUES PAM_SUCCESS This module will usually
return this value</p>

<p>PAM_AUTH_ERR Authentication failure.</p>

<p>PAM_BUF_ERR Memory buffer error.</p>

<p>PAM_IGNORE The return value should be ignored by PAM
dispatch.</p>

<p>PAM_SERVICE_ERR Cannot determine the user name.</p>

<p>PAM_SESSION_ERR This module will return this value if
its arguments are invalid or if a system error such as
ENOMEM occurs.</p>

<p>PAM_USER_UNKNOWN User not known.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Add this line to your login entries to start
each login session with its own session keyring:</p>

<p>session required pam_keyinit.so</p>

<p>This will prevent keys from one session leaking into
another session for the same user.</p>
