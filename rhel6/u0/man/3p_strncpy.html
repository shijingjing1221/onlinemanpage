<p>STRNCPY(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual STRNCPY(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME strncpy - copy part of a string</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;string.h&gt;</p>

<p>char *strncpy(char *restrict s1, const char *restrict
s2, size_t n);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The strncpy() function shall copy not more
than n bytes (bytes that follow a null byte are not copied)
from the array pointed to by s2 to the array pointed to by
s1. If copying takes place between objects that overlap, the
behavior is undefined.</p>

<p>If the array pointed to by s2 is a string that is
shorter than n bytes, null bytes shall be appended to the
copy in the array pointed to by s1, until n bytes in all are
written.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The strncpy() function shall return s1; no
return value is reserved to indicate an error.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE Character movement is performed
differently in different implementa- tions. Thus,
overlapping moves may yield surprises.</p>

<p>If there is no null byte in the first n bytes of the
array pointed to by s2, the result is not
null-terminated.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
