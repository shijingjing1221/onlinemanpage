<p>GROFF_FONT(5) GROFF_FONT(5)</p>

<p>NAME groff_font - format of groff device and font
description files</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The groff font format is roughly a superset
of the ditroff font format. The font files for device name
are stored in a directory devname. There are two types of
file: a device description file called DESC and for each
font F a font file called F. These are text files; unlike
the ditroff font format, there is no associated binary
format.</p>

<p>DESC file format The DESC file can contain the following
types of line as shown below. Later entries in the file
override previous values.</p>

<p>charset This line and everything following in the file
are ignored. It is allowed for the sake of backwards
compatibility.</p>

<p>family fam The default font family is fam.</p>

<p>fonts n F1 F2 F3...Fn Fonts F1...Fn will be mounted in
the font positions m+1,...,m+n where m is the number of
styles. This command may extend over more than one line. A
font name of 0 will cause no font to be mounted on the
corresponding font position.</p>

<p>hor n The horizontal resolution is n machine units.</p>

<p>paperheight n The physical vertical dimension of the
output medium in machine units. This isn t used by troff
itself; currently, only grops uses it.</p>

<p>paperwidth n The physical horizontal dimension of the
output medium in machine units. This isn t used by troff.
Currently, only the grolbp output device uses it.</p>

<p>papersize string Select a paper size. Valid values for
string are the ISO paper types A0-A7, B0-B7, C0-C7, D0-D7,
DL, and the US paper types letter, legal, tabloid, ledger,
statement, executive, com10, and monarch. Case is not
significant for string if it holds prede- fined paper types.
Alternatively, string can be a file name (e.g.
/etc/papersize); if the file can be opened, groff reads the
first line and tests for the above paper sizes. Finally,
string can be a custom paper size in the format length,width
(no spaces before and after the comma). Both length and
width must have a unit appended; valid values are i for
inches, c for centimeters, p for points, and P for picas.
Example: 12c,235p. An argument which starts with a digit is
always treated as a custom paper format. papersize sets both
the ver- tical and horizontal dimension of the output
medium.</p>

<p>More than one argument can be specified; groff scans
from left to right and uses the first valid paper
specification.</p>

<p>pass_filenames Make troff tell the driver the source
file name being processed. This is achieved by another
tcommand: F filename.</p>

<p>postpro program Use program as the postprocessor.</p>

<p>prepro program Call program as a preprocessor.</p>

<p>print program Use program as the spooler program for
printing. If omitted, the -l and -L options of groff are
ignored.</p>

<p>res n There are n machine units per inch.</p>

<p>sizes s1 s2...sn 0 This means that the device has fonts
at s1, s2,...sn scaled points. The list of sizes must be
terminated by a 0. Each si can also be a range of sizes m-n.
The list can extend over more than one line.</p>

<p>sizescale n The scale factor for pointsizes. By default
this has a value of 1. One scaled point is equal to one
point/n. The arguments to the unitwidth and sizes commands
are given in scaled points.</p>

<p>styles S1 S2...Sm The first m font positions will be
associated with styles S1...Sm.</p>

<p>tcommand This means that the postprocessor can handle
the t and u output commands.</p>

<p>unitwidth n Quantities in the font files are given in
machine units for fonts whose point size is n scaled
points.</p>

<p>use_charnames_in_special This command indicates that
troff should encode named characters inside special
commands.</p>

<p>vert n The vertical resolution is n machine units.</p>

<p>The res, unitwidth, fonts, and sizes lines are
compulsory. Other com- mands are ignored by troff but may be
used by postprocessors to store arbitrary information about
the device in the DESC file.</p>

<p>Here a list of obsolete keywords which are recognized by
groff but com- pletely ignored: spare1, spare2,
biggestfont.</p>

<p>Font file format A font file has two sections. The first
section is a sequence of lines each containing a sequence of
blank delimited words; the first word in the line is a key,
and subsequent words give a value for that key.</p>

<p>ligatures lig1 lig2...lign [0] Characters lig1, lig2,
..., lign are ligatures; possible liga- tures are ff, fi,
fl, ffi and ffl. For backwards compatibility, the list of
ligatures may be terminated with a 0. The list of ligatures
may not extend over more than one line.</p>

<p>name F The name of the font is F.</p>

<p>slant n The characters of the font have a slant of n
degrees. (Positive means forward.)</p>

<p>spacewidth n The normal width of a space is n.</p>

<p>special The font is special; this means that when a
character is requested that is not present in the current
font, it will be searched for in any special fonts that are
mounted.</p>

<p>Other commands are ignored by troff but may be used by
postprocessors to store arbitrary information about the font
in the font file.</p>

<p>The first section can contain comments which start with
the # character and extend to the end of a line.</p>

<p>The second section contains one or two subsections. It
must contain a charset subsection and it may also contain a
kernpairs subsection. These subsections can appear in any
order. Each subsection starts with a word on a line by
itself.</p>

<p>The word charset starts the charset subsection. The
charset line is followed by a sequence of lines. Each line
gives information for one character. A line comprises a
number of fields separated by blanks or tabs. The format
is</p>

<p>name metrics type code [entity_name] [-- comment]</p>

<p>name identifies the character: if name is a single
character c then it corresponds to the groff input character
c; if it is of the formc where c is a single character, then
it corresponds to the special char- acter [c]; otherwise it
corresponds to the groff input character [name]. If it is
exactly two characters xx it can be entered as(xx. Note that
single-letter special characters can t be accessed asc; the
only exception is &minus; which is identical to &minus; .
The name --- is special and indicates that the character is
unnamed; such characters can only be used by means of the
escape sequence in troff.</p>

<p>Groff supports eight-bit characters; however some
utilities have diffi- culties with eight-bit characters. For
this reason, there is a conven- tion that the name charn is
equivalent to the single character whose code is n. For
example, char163 would be equivalent to the character with
code 163 which is the pounds sterling sign in ISO
Latin-1.</p>

<p>The type field gives the character type:</p>

<p>1 means the character has a descender, for example,
p;</p>

<p>2 means the character has an ascender, for example,
b;</p>

<p>3 means the character has both an ascender and a
descender, for example, (.</p>

<p>The code field gives the code which the postprocessor
uses to print the character. The character can also be input
to groff using this code by means of the escape sequence.
The code can be any integer. If it starts with a 0 it will
be interpreted as octal; if it starts with 0x or 0X it will
be intepreted as hexadecimal. Note, however, that the escape
sequence only accepts a decimal integer.</p>

<p>The entity_name field gives an ascii string identifying
the glyph which the postprocessor uses to print the
character. This field is optional and has been introduced so
that the html device driver can encode its character set.
For example, the character &pound; is represented as
&amp;pound; in html 4.0.</p>

<p>Anything on the line after the encoding field resp.
after -- will be ignored.</p>

<p>The metrics field has the form (in one line; it is
broken here for the sake of readability):</p>

<p>width[,height[,depth[,italic-correction
[,left-italic-correction[,subscript-correction]]]]]</p>

<p>There must not be any spaces between these subfields.
Missing sub- fields are assumed to be 0. The subfields are
all decimal integers. Since there is no associated binary
format, these values are not required to fit into a variable
of type char as they are in ditroff. The width subfields
gives the width of the character. The height sub- field
gives the height of the character (upwards is positive); if
a character does not extend above the baseline, it should be
given a zero height, rather than a negative height. The
depth subfield gives the depth of the character, that is,
the distance below the lowest point below the baseline to
which the character extends (downwards is posi- tive); if a
character does not extend below above the baseline, it
should be given a zero depth, rather than a negative depth.
The italic-correction subfield gives the amount of space
that should be added after the character when it is
immediately to be followed by a character from a roman font.
The left-italic-correction subfield gives the amount of
space that should be added before the character when it is
immediately to be preceded by a character from a roman font.
The subscript-correction gives the amount of space that
should be added after a character before adding a subscript.
This should be less than the italic correction.</p>

<p>A line in the charset section can also have the
format</p>

<p>name &quot;</p>

<p>This indicates that name is just another name for the
character men- tioned in the preceding line.</p>

<p>The word kernpairs starts the kernpairs section. This
contains a sequence of lines of the form:</p>

<p>c1 c2 n</p>

<p>This means that when character c1 appears next to
character c2 the space between them should be increased by
n. Most entries in kernpairs section will have a negative
value for n.</p>
