<p>IDLE(2) Linux Programmer s Manual IDLE(2)</p>

<p>NAME idle - make process 0 idle</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>int idle(void);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION idle() is an internal system call used
during bootstrap. It marks the process s pages as swappable,
lowers its priority, and enters the main scheduling loop.
idle() never returns.</p>

<p>Only process 0 may call idle(). Any user process, even a
process with superuser permission, will receive EPERM.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE idle() never returns for process 0, and
always returns -1 for a user process.</p>

<p>ERRORS EPERM Always, for a user process.</p>

<p>VERSIONS Since 2.3.13 this system call does not exist
anymore.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO This function is Linux-specific, and
should not be used in programs intended to be portable.</p>

<p>COLOPHON This page is part of release 3.22 of the Linux
man-pages project. A description of the project, and
information about reporting bugs, can be found at
