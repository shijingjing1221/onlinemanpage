<p>BLKID(8) MAINTENANCE COMMANDS BLKID(8)</p>

<p>NAME blkid - command-line utility to locate/print block
device attributes</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS blkid -L label | -U uuid</p>

<p>blkid [-ghlv] [-c file] [-w file] [-o format] [-s tag]
[-t NAME=value] device [device ...]</p>

<p>blkid -p [-O offset] [-S size] [-o format] [-s tag] [-u
list] device [device ...]</p>

<p>blkid -i [-o format] [-s tag] device [device ...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The blkid program is the command-line
interface to working with lib- blkid(3) library. It can
determine the type of content (e.g. filesys- tem, swap) a
block device holds, and also attributes (tokens, NAME=value
pairs) from the content metadata (e.g. LABEL or UUID
fields).</p>

<p>blkid has two main forms of operation: either searching
for a device with a specific NAME=value pair, or displaying
NAME=value pairs for one or more devices.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -c cachefile Read from cachefile instead of
reading from the default cache file /etc/blkid/blkid.tab. If
you want to start with a clean cache (i.e. dont report
devices previously scanned but not nec- essarily available
at this time), specify /dev/null.</p>

<p>-g Perform a garbage collection pass on the blkid cache
to remove devices which no longer exist.</p>

<p>-h Display a usage message and exit.</p>

<p>-i Display I/O Limits (aka I/O topology) information.
The export output format is automatically enabled. This
option could be used together with -p option.</p>

<p>-l Look up one device that matches the search parameter
specified using the -t option. If there are multiple devices
that match the specified search parameter, then the device
with the highest priority is returned, and/or the first
device found at a given priority. Device types in order of
decreasing priority are Device Mapper, EVMS, LVM, MD, and
finally regular block devices. If this option is not
specified, blkid will print all of the devices that match
the search parameter.</p>

<p>-L label Look up one device that uses the label (same
as: -l -o device -t LABEL=&lt;label&gt;). This look up
method is able to reliable use /dev/disk/by-label udev
symlinks (depends on setting in /etc/blkid.conf). Avoid to
use the symlinks directly. It is not reliable to use the
symlinks without verification. The -L option works on
systems with and without udev.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the original blkid(8) from e2fsprogs use
the -L option as a synonym to the -o list option. For better
portabil- ity use &quot;-l -o device -t
LABEL=&lt;label&gt;&quot; and &quot;-o list&quot; in your
scripts rather than -L option.</p>

<p>-u list Restrict probing functions to defined (comma
separated) list of &quot;usage&quot; types. Supported usage
types are: filesystem, raid, crypto and other. The list can
be prefixed with &quot;no&quot; to specify the usage types
which should be ignored. For example:</p>

<p>blkid -p -u filesystem,other /dev/sda1</p>

<p>probes for all filesystems and others (e.g. swap)
formats, and</p>

<p>blkid -p -u noraid /dev/sda1</p>

<p>probes for all supported formats exclude RAIDs. This
option is useful with -p only.</p>

<p>-U uuid Look up one device that uses the uuid. For more
details see the -L option.</p>

<p>-o format Display blkids output using the specified
format. The format parameter may be:</p>

<p>full print all tags (the default)</p>

<p>value print the value of the tags</p>

<p>list print the devices in a user-friendly format, this
output format is unsupported for low-level probing (-p or
-i)</p>

<p>device print the device name only, this output format is
always enabled for -L and -U options</p>

<p>udev print key=&quot;value&quot; pairs for easy import
into the udev environment</p>

<p>export print key=value pairs for easy import into the
environ- ment. This output format is automatically enabled
when I/O Limits (-i option) are requested.</p>

<p>-O bytes Probe at the given offset (only useful with
-p). This option could be used together with -i option.</p>

<p>-p Switch to low-level superblock probing mode (bypass
cache).</p>

<p>-s tag For each (specified) device, show only the tags
that match tag. It is possible to specify multiple -s
options. If no tag is specified, then all tokens are shown
for all (specified) devices. In order to just refresh the
cache without showing any tokens, use -s none with no other
options.</p>

<p>-S bytes Overwrite device/file size (only useful with
-p).</p>

<p>-t NAME=value Search for block devices with tokens named
NAME that have the value value, and display any devices
which are found. Common values for NAME include TYPE, LABEL,
and UUID. If there are no devices specified on the command
line, all block devices will be searched; otherwise only the
specified devices are searched.</p>

<p>-v Display version number and exit.</p>

<p>-w writecachefile Write the device cache to
writecachefile instead of writing it to the default cache
file /etc/blkid/blkid.tab. If you dont want to save the
cache to the default file, specify /dev/null. If not
specified it will be the same file as that given by the -c
option.</p>

<p>device Display tokens from only the specified device. It
is possible to give multiple device options on the command
line. If none is given, all devices which appear in
/proc/partitions are shown, if they are recognized.</p>

<p>RETURN CODE If the specified token was found, or if any
tags were shown from (spec- ified) devices, 0 is returned.
If the specified token was not found, or no (specified)
devices could be identified, an exit code of 2 is returned.
For usage or other errors, an exit code of 4 is
returned.</p>
