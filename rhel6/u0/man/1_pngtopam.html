<p>NAME pngtopam - convert a PNG image into a Netpbm
image</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pngtopam [-verbose] [-alphapam | -alpha | -mix]
[-background=color] [-gamma=value] [-text=filename] [-time]
[pngfile]</p>

<p>Minimum unique abbreviation of option is acceptable. You
may use dou- ble hyphens instead of single hyphen to denote
options. You may use white space in place of the equals sign
to separate an option name from its value.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pngtopam reads a PNG image (Portable Network Graphics)
as input and produces a Netpbm image as output. The type of
the output file depends on the input file - if its black
&amp; white, pngtopam creates a PBM file. If its grayscale,
pngtopam creates a PGM file. Otherwise, it creates a PPM
file. Except that with the -alphapam option, it always
creates a PAM file. That file has tuple type GRAYSCALE_ALPHA
or RGB_ALPHA depending on whether the input has color or
not.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -verbose Display various information about the
input PNG image and the conversion process.</p>

<p>If you want even more information about the PNG image,
use pngcheck (not part of Netpbm).</p>

<p>-alphapam Produce a single output image containing the
main image (fore- ground) and the alpha channel or
transparency mask. This image is in the PAM format with
tuple type of either GRAYSCALE_ALPHA (which has a depth of 2
channels) or RGB_ALPHA (which has a depth of 4
channels).</p>

<p>You can specify only one of -alphapam, -alpha, and -mix.
With none of them, pngtopam produces an image of the
foreground of the input image and discards transparency
information.</p>

<p>This option was new in Netpbm 10.44 (September
2008).</p>

<p>-alpha Output the alpha channel or transparency mask of
the image. The result is either a PBM file or a PGM file,
depending on whether different levels of transparency
appear.</p>

<p>pngtopam discards the main image (the foreground).</p>

<p>You can specify only one of -alphapam, -alpha, and -mix.
With none of them, pngtopam produces an image of the
foreground of the input image and discards transparency
information.</p>

<p>-mix Compose the image with the transparency or alpha
mask against a background. The background color is
determined by the bKGD chunk in the PNG, except that you can
override it with -back- ground. If the PNG has no bKGD chunk
and you dont specify -background, the background color is
white.</p>

<p>You can specify only one of -alphapam, -alpha, and -mix.
With none of them, pngtopam produces an image of the
foreground of the input image and discards transparency
information.</p>

<p>-background=color This option specifies the background
color with which to mix the image when you specify -mix.</p>

<p>color is as described for the argument of the
ppm_parsecolor() library routine .</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<p>&middot; -background=rgb:01/ff/80</p>

<p>&middot; -background=rgbi:1/255/128</p>

<p>If you dont specify -background, the background color is
what is specified in the PNG image, and if the PNG doesnt
specify anything, white.</p>

<p>You cannot specify -background unless you also specify
-mix. Before Netpbm 10.27 (March 2005), you could specify
-background without -mix and it was just ignored. (This
caused a usability problem).</p>

<p>-gamma=value Converts the image to a new display-gamma
value. If a gAMA chunk is present in the png-file, pngtopam
uses the specified image-gamma value. If not, pngtopam
considers the image-gamma to be 1.0. Based on the
image-gamma and the display-gamma given with this option,
pngtopam adjusts the colors written to the pnm-file.</p>

<p>Because the gammas of uncompensated monitors are around
2.6, which results in an image-gamma of 0.45, some typical
situations are: when the image-gamma is 0.45 (use -verbose
to check) and the picture is too light, your system is
gamma-corrected, so convert with -gamma 1.0. When no gAMA
chunk is present or the image-gamma is 1.0, use 2.2 to make
the picture lighter and 0.45 to make the picture darker.</p>

<p>One oddity to be aware of when using -gamma on an image
with transparency: The PNG image specifies that a certain
color is transparent, i.e. every pixel in the image of that
color is transparent. But pngtopam interprets this as
applying to the gamma-corrected space, and there may be less
precision in that space than in the original, which means
multiple uncorrected colors map to the same corrected color.
So imagine that the image contains 3 shades of white and
specifies that one of them is transparent. After gamma
correction, those three shades are indistinguishable, so
pngtopam considers pixels of all three shades to be
transparent.</p>

<p>If this is not what you want, dont use gamma. Instead,
use pnmgamma on the output.</p>

<p>-text=file Writes the tEXt and zTXt chunks to a file, in
a format as described in the pnmtopng user manual. These
chunks contain text comments or annotations.</p>

<p>-time Prints the tIME chunk to stderr.</p>

<p>NOTE A PNG image contains a lot of information that cant
be represented in Netpbm formats. Therefore, you lose
information when you convert to another format with
&quot;pngtopam | pnmtoxxx&quot;. If there is a specialized
converter that converts directly to the other format, e.g.
ptot to con- vert from PNG to TIFF, youll get better results
using that.</p>

<p>LIMITATIONS There could be an option to include PNG
comment chunks in the output image as PNM comments instead
of putting them in a separate file.</p>

<p>The program could be much faster, with a bit of code
optimizing. As with any Netpbm program, speed always takes a
back seat to quick present and future development.</p>

<p>HISTORY pngtopam was new in Netpbm 10.44, as a
replacement for pngtopnm. The main improvement over pngtopnm
was that it could generate a PAM image with a transparency
channel, whereas with pngtopnm, you would have to extrac the
transparency channel as a separate file, in a separate
run.</p>

<p>pngtopnm was new in Netpbm 8.1 (March 2000), the first
big change to the package in Netpbms renaissance. It and
pnmtopng were simply copied from the pnmtopng package (1) by
Greg Roelofs. Those were based on simpler reference
applications by by Alexander Lehmann
&lt;alex@hal.rhein-main.de&gt; and Willem van Schaik
&lt;willem@schaik.com&gt; and distributed with their PNG
library.</p>

<p>Nearly all of the code has changed since it was copied
from the pnm- topng package, most of it just to improve
maintainability.</p>
