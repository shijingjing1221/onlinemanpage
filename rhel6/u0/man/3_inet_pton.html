<p>INET_PTON(3) Linux Programmer s Manual INET_PTON(3)</p>

<p>NAME inet_pton - convert IPv4 and IPv6 addresses from
text to binary form</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;arpa/inet.h&gt;</p>

<p>int inet_pton(int af, const char *src, void *dst);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This function converts the character string
src into a network address structure in the af address
family, then copies the network address structure to dst.
The af argument must be either AF_INET or AF_INET6.</p>

<p>The following address families are currently
supported:</p>

<p>AF_INET src points to a character string containing an
IPv4 network address in dotted-decimal format,
&quot;ddd.ddd.ddd.ddd&quot;, where ddd is a decimal number
of up to three digits in the range 0 to 255. The address is
converted to a struct in_addr and copied to dst, which must
be sizeof(struct in_addr) (4) bytes (32 bits) long.</p>

<p>AF_INET6 src points to a character string containing an
IPv6 network address. The address is converted to a struct
in6_addr and copied to dst, which must be sizeof(struct
in6_addr) (16) bytes (128 bits) long. The allowed formats
for IPv6 addresses follow these rules:</p>

<p>1. The preferred format is x:x:x:x:x:x:x:x. This form
consists of eight hexadecimal numbers, each of which
expresses a 16-bit value (i.e., each x can be up to 4 hex
digits).</p>

<p>2. A series of contiguous zero values in the preferred
format can be abbreviated to ::. Only one instance of :: can
occur in an address. For example, the loopback address
0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1 can be abbreviated as ::1. The wildcard
address, consisting of all zeroes, can be written as ::.</p>

<p>3. An alternate format is useful for expressing
IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses. This form is written as
x:x:x:x:x:x:d.d.d.d, where the six leading xs are
hexadecimal values that define the six most-significant
16-bit pieces of the address (i.e., 96 bits), and the ds
express a value in dotted-decimal nota- tion that defines
the least significant 32 bits of the address. An example of
such an address is ::FFFF:204.152.189.116.</p>

<p>See RFC 2373 for further details on the representation
of IPv6 addresses.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE inet_pton() returns 1 on success (network
address was successfully con- verted). 0 is returned if src
does not contain a character string rep- resenting a valid
network address in the specified address family. If af does
not contain a valid address family, -1 is returned and errno
is set to EAFNOSUPPORT.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>NOTES Unlike inet_aton(3) and inet_addr(3), inet_pton()
supports IPv6 addresses. On the other hand, inet_pton() only
accepts IPv4 addresses in dotted-decimal notation, whereas
inet_aton(3) and inet_addr(3) allow the more general
numbers-and-dots notation (hexadecimal and octal num- ber
formats, and formats that dont require all four bytes to be
explicitly written). For an interface that handles both IPv6
addresses, and IPv4 addresses in numbers-and-dots notation,
see getad- drinfo(3).</p>

<p>BUGS AF_INET6 does not recognize IPv4 addresses. An
explicit IPv4-mapped IPv6 address must be supplied in src
instead.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE The program below demonstrates the use of
inet_pton() and inet_ntop(3). Here are some example
runs:</p>

<p>$ ./a.out i6 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0 :: $ ./a.out i6
1:0:0:0:0:0:0:8 1::8 $ ./a.out i6
0:0:0:0:0:FFFF:204.152.189.116 ::ffff:204.152.189.116</p>

<p>Program source</p>

<p>#include &lt;arpa/inet.h&gt; #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt; #include &lt;string.h&gt;</p>

<p>int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { unsigned char
buf[sizeof(struct in6_addr)]; int domain, s; char
str[INET6_ADDRSTRLEN];</p>

<p>if (argc != 3) { fprintf(stderr, &quot;Usage: %s
{i4|i6|&lt;num&gt;} string0, argv[0]); exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}</p>

<p>domain = (strcmp(argv[1], &quot;i4&quot;) == 0) ?
AF_INET : (strcmp(argv[1], &quot;i6&quot;) == 0) ? AF_INET6
: atoi(argv[1]);</p>

<p>s = inet_pton(domain, argv[2], buf); if (s &lt;= 0) { if
(s == 0) fprintf(stderr, &quot;Not in presentation
format&quot;); else perror(&quot;inet_pton&quot;);
exit(EXIT_FAILURE); }</p>

<p>if (inet_ntop(domain, buf, str, INET6_ADDRSTRLEN) ==
NULL) { perror(&quot;inet_ntop&quot;); exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}</p>

<p>printf(&quot;%s0, str);</p>

<p>exit(EXIT_SUCCESS); }</p>
