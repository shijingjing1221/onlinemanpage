<p>NAME xfsdump - XFS filesystem incremental dump
utility</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS xfsdump -h xfsdump [ options ] -f dest [ -f
dest ... ] filesystem xfsdump [ options ] - filesystem
xfsdump -I [ subopt=value ... ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION xfsdump backs up files and their attributes
in a filesystem. The files are dumped to storage media, a
regular file, or standard output. Options allow the operator
to have all files dumped, just files that have changed since
a previous dump, or just files contained in a list of
pathnames.</p>

<p>The xfsrestore(8) utility re-populates a filesystem with
the contents of the dump.</p>

<p>Each invocation of xfsdump dumps just one filesystem.
That invocation is termed a dump session. The dump session
splits the filesystem into one or more dump streams, one per
destination. The split is done in filesystem inode number
(ino) order, at boundaries selected to equalize the size of
each stream. Furthermore, the breakpoints between streams
may be in the middle of very large files (at extent
boundaries) if nec- essary to achieve reasonable stream size
equalization. Each dump stream can span several media
objects, and a single media object can contain several dump
streams. The typical media object is a tape car- tridge. The
media object records the dump stream as one or more media
files. A media file is a self-contained partial dump,
intended to min- imize the impact of media dropouts on the
entire dump stream at the expense of increasing the time
required to complete the dump. By default only one media
file is written unless a media file size is specified using
the -d option. Other techniques, such as making a sec- ond
copy of the dump image, provide more protection against
media fail- ures than multiple media files will.</p>

<p>However, the current implementation in Linux only
supports one destina- tion and running single threaded.
Therefore, the above comments regard- ing multiple streams
describe the possible future capabilities.</p>

<p>xfsdump maintains an online dump inventory in
/var/lib/xfsdump/inven- tory. The -I option displays the
inventory contents hierarchically. The levels of the
hierarchy are: filesystem, dump session, stream, and media
file.</p>

<p>The options to xfsdump are:</p>

<p>-a Specifies that files for which the Data Migration
Facility (DMF) has complete offline copies (dual-state
files) be treated as if they were offline (OFL). This means
that the file data will not be dumped by xfsdump, resulting
in a smaller dump file. If the file is later restored the
file data is still accessible through DMF. If both -a option
and -z option are specified, the -a option takes precedence
(see -z option below).</p>

<p>-b blocksize Specifies the blocksize, in bytes, to be
used for the dump. The same blocksize must be specified to
restore the tape. If the -m option is not used, then -b does
not need to be specified. Instead, a default blocksize of
1Mb will be used.</p>

<p>-c progname Use the specified program to alert the
operator when a media change is required. The alert program
is typically a script to send a mail or flash a window to
draw the operator s attention.</p>

<p>-d filesize Specifies the size, in megabytes, of dump
media files. If not specified, xfsdump will dump data to
tape using a single media file per media object. The
specified media file size may need to be adjusted if, for
example, xfsdump cannot fit a media file onto a single
tape.</p>

<p>-e Allow files to be excluded from the dump. This will
cause xfsdump to skip files which have the &quot;no
dump&quot; file attribute set. See the &quot;Excluding
individual files&quot; section below for details on setting
this file attribute. Files with an extended attribute named
&quot;SGI_XFSDUMP_SKIP_FILE&quot; will also be skipped,
however this method is deprecated and xfsdump will stop
checking for it in a future version.</p>

<p>-f dest [ -f dest ... ] Specifies a dump destination. A
dump destination can be the path- name of a device (such as
a tape drive), a regular file or a remote tape drive (see
rmt(8)). This option must be omitted if the standard output
option (a lone - preceding the source filesys- tem
specification) is specified.</p>

<p>-l level Specifies a dump level of 0 to 9. The dump
level determines the base dump to which this dump is
relative. The base dump is the most recent dump at a lesser
level. A level 0 dump is absolute - all files are dumped. A
dump level where 1 &lt;= level &lt;= 9 is referred to as an
incremental dump. Only files that have been changed since
the base dump are dumped. Subtree dumps (see the -s option
below) cannot be used as the base for incremental dumps.</p>

<p>-m Use the minimal tape protocol for non-scsi tape
destinations or remote tape destinations which are not scsi
Linux tape drives nor IRIX tape drives. This option cannot
be used without specifying a blocksize to be used (see -b
option above).</p>

<p>-o Overwrite the tape. With this option, xfsdump does
not read the tape first to check the contents. This option
may be used if xfs- dump is unable to determine the block
size of a tape .</p>

<p>-p interval Causes progress reports to be printed at the
specified interval. interval is given in seconds. The
progress report indicates how many files have been dumped,
the total number of files to dump, the percentage of data
dumped, and the elapsed time.</p>

<p>-q Destination tape drive is a QIC tape. QIC tapes only
use a 512 byte blocksize, for which xfsdump must make
special allowances.</p>

<p>-s pathname [ -s pathname ... ] Restricts the dump to
files contained in the specified pathnames (subtrees). A
pathname must be relative to the mount point of the
filesystem. For example, if a filesystem is mounted at /d2,
the pathname argument for the directory /d2/users is users.
A pathname can be a file or a directory; if it is a
directory, the entire hierarchy of files and subdirectories
rooted at that direc- tory is dumped. Subtree dumps cannot
be used as the base for incremental dumps (see the -l option
above).</p>

<p>-t file Sets the dump time to the modification time of
file rather than using the current time. xfsdump uses the
dump time to determine what files need to be backed up
during an incremental dump. This option should be used when
dumping snapshots so that the dump time matches the time the
snapshot was taken. Otherwise files modified after a
snapshot is taken may be skipped in the next incremental
dump.</p>

<p>-v verbosity -v subsys=verbosity[,subsys=verbosity,...]
Specifies the level of detail used for messages displayed
during the course of the dump. The verbosity argument can be
passed as either a string or an integer. If passed as a
string the following values may be used: silent, verbose,
trace, debug, or nitty. If passed as an integer, values from
0-5 may be used. The values 0-4 correspond to the strings
already listed. The value 5 can be used to produce even more
verbose debug output.</p>

<p>The first form of this option activates message logging
across all dump subsystems. The second form allows the
message logging level to be controlled on a per-subsystem
basis. The two forms can be combined (see the example
below). The argument subsys can take one of the following
values: general, proc, drive, media, inventory, inomap and
excluded_files.</p>

<p>For example, to dump the root filesystem with tracing
activated for all subsystems:</p>

<p># xfsdump -v trace -f /dev/tape /</p>

<p>To enable debug-level tracing for drive and media
operations:</p>

<p># xfsdump -v drive=debug,media=debug -f /dev/tape /</p>

<p>To enable tracing for all subsystems, and debug level
tracing for drive operations only:</p>

<p># xfsdump -v trace,drive=debug -f /dev/tape /</p>

<p>To list files that will be excluded from the dump:</p>

<p># xfsdump -e -v excluded_files=debug -f /dev/tape /</p>

<p>-z size Specifies the maximum size, in kilobytes, of
files to be included in the dump. Files over this size, will
be excluded from the dump, except for DMF dual-state files
when -a option is speci- fied (see -a option above). When
specified, -a option takes precedence over -z option. The
size is an estimate based on the number of disk blocks
actually used by the file, and so does not include holes. In
other words, size refers to the amount of space the file
would take in the resulting dump. On an interactive restore,
the skipped file is visible with xfsrestores ls and while
you can use the add and extract commands, nothing will be
restored.</p>

<p>-A Do not dump extended file attributes. When dumping a
filesystem managed within a DMF environment this option
should not be used. DMF stores file migration status within
extended attributes asso- ciated with each file. If these
attributes are not preserved when the filesystem is
restored, files that had been in migrated state will not be
recallable by DMF. Note that dumps containing extended file
attributes cannot be restored with older versions of xfsre-
store(8).</p>

<p>-B session_id Specifies the ID of the dump session upon
which this dump session is to be based. If this option is
specified, the -l (level) and -R (resume) options are not
allowed. Instead, xfsdump determines if the current dump
session should be incremental and/or resumed, by looking at
the base sessions level and interrupted attributes. If the
base session was interrupted, the current dump session is a
resumption of that base at the same level. Otherwise, the
current dump session is an incremental dump with a level one
greater than that of the base session. This option allows
incremental and resumed dumps to be based on any previous
dump, rather than just the most recent.</p>

<p>-E Pre-erase media. If this option is specified, media
is erased prior to use. The operator is prompted for
confirmation, unless the -F option is also specified.</p>

<p>-F Dont prompt the operator. When xfsdump encounters a
media object containing non-xfsdump data, xfsdump normally
asks the operator for permission to overwrite. With this
option the overwrite is performed, no questions asked. When
xfsdump encounters end-of- media during a dump, xfsdump
normally asks the operator if another media object will be
provided. With this option the dump is instead
interrupted.</p>

<p>-I Displays the xfsdump inventory (no dump is
performed). xfsdump records each dump session in an online
inventory in /var/lib/xfs- dump/inventory. xfsdump uses this
inventory to determine the base for incremental dumps. It is
also useful for manually identifying a dump session to be
restored. Suboptions to filter the inventory display are
described later.</p>

<p>-J Inhibits the normal update of the inventory. This is
useful when the media being dumped to will be discarded or
overwritten.</p>

<p>-L session_label Specifies a label for the dump session.
It can be any arbitrary string up to 255 characters
long.</p>

<p>-M label [ -M label ... ] Specifies a label for the
first media object (for example, tape cartridge) written on
the corresponding destination during the session. It can be
any arbitrary string up to 255 characters long. Multiple
media object labels can be specified, one for each
destination.</p>

<p>-O options_file Insert the options contained in
options_file into the beginning of the command line. The
options are specified just as they would appear if typed
into the command line. In addition, newline char- acters (0
can be used as whitespace. The options are placed before all
options actually given on the command line, just after the
command name. Only one -O option can be used. Recursive use
is ignored. The source filesystem cannot be specified in
options_file.</p>

<p>-R Resumes a previously interrupted dump session. If the
most recent dump at this dump s level (-l option) was
interrupted, this dump contains only files not in the
interrupted dump and consistent with the incremental level.
However, files contained in the interrupted dump that have
been subsequently modified are re- dumped.</p>

<p>-T Inhibits interactive dialogue timeouts. When the -F
option is not specified, xfsdump prompts the operator for
labels and media changes. Each dialogue normally times out
if no response is sup- plied. This option prevents the
timeout.</p>

<p>-Y length Specify I/O buffer ring length. xfsdump uses a
ring of output buffers to achieve maximum throughput when
dumping to tape drives. The default ring length is 3.
However, this is only supported when running multi-threaded
which has not been done for Linux yet - making this option
benign.</p>

<p>- A lone - causes the dump stream to be sent to the
standard output, where it can be piped to another utility
such as xfsrestore(8) or redirected to a file. This option
cannot be used with the -f option. The - must follow all
other options and precede the filesystem specification.</p>

<p>The filesystem, filesystem, can be specified either as a
mount point or as a special device file (for example,
/dev/dsk/dks0d1s0). The filesystem must be mounted to be
dumped.</p>

<p>NOTES Dump Interruption A dump can be interrupted at any
time and later resumed. To interrupt, type control-C (or the
current terminal interrupt character). The operator is
prompted to select one of several operations, including dump
interruption. After the operator selects dump interruption,
the dump continues until a convenient break point is
encountered (typically the end of the current file). Very
large files are broken into smaller subfiles, so the wait
for the end of the current file is brief.</p>

<p>Dump Resumption A previously interrupted dump can be
resumed by specifying the -R option. If the most recent dump
at the specified level was inter- rupted, the new dump does
not include files already dumped, unless they have changed
since the interrupted dump.</p>

<p>Media Management A single media object can contain many
dump streams. Conversely, a single dump stream can span
multiple media objects. If a dump stream is sent to a media
object already containing one or more dumps, xfsdump appends
the new dump stream after the last dump stream. Media files
are never overwritten. If end-of-media is encountered during
the course of a dump, the operator is prompted to insert a
new media object into the drive. The dump stream
continuation is appended after the last media file on the
new media object.</p>

<p>Inventory Each dump session updates an inventory
database in /var/lib/xfs- dump/inventory. xfsdump uses the
inventory to determine the base of incremental and resumed
dumps.</p>

<p>This database can be displayed by invoking xfsdump with
the -I option. The display uses tabbed indentation to
present the inventory hierarchi- cally. The first level is
filesystem. The second level is session. The third level is
media stream (currently only one stream is sup- ported). The
fourth level lists the media files sequentially composing
the stream.</p>

<p>The following suboptions are available to filter the
display.</p>

<p>-I depth=n (where n is 1, 2, or 3) limits the
hierarchical depth of the dis- play. When n is 1, only the
filesystem information from the inven- tory is displayed.
When n is 2, only filesystem and session infor- mation are
displayed. When n is 3, only filesystem, session and stream
information are displayed.</p>

<p>-I level=n (where n is the dump level) limits the
display to dumps of that particular dump level.</p>

<p>The display may be restricted to media files contained
in a specific media object.</p>

<p>-I mobjid=value (where value is a media ID) specifies
the media object by its media ID.</p>

<p>-I mobjlabel=value (where value is a media label)
specifies the media object by its media label.</p>

<p>Similarly, the display can be restricted to a specific
filesystem.</p>

<p>-I mnt=mount_point (that is, [hostname:]pathname),
identifies the filesystem by mountpoint. Specifying the
hostname is optional, but may be use- ful in a clustered
environment where more than one host can be responsible for
dumping a filesystem.</p>

<p>-I fsid=filesystem_id identifies the filesystem by
filesystem ID.</p>

<p>-I dev=device_pathname (that is,
[hostname:]device_pathname) identifies the filesystem by
device. As with the mnt filter, specifying the hostname is
optional.</p>

<p>More than one of these suboptions, separated by commas,
may be speci- fied at the same time to limit the display of
the inventory to those dumps of interest. However, at most
four suboptions can be specified at once: one to constrain
the display hierarchy depth, one to constrain the dump
level, one to constrain the media object, and one to
constrain the filesystem.</p>

<p>For example, -I depth=1,mobjlabel=&quot;tape
1&quot;,mnt=host1:/test_mnt would display only the
filesystem information (depth=1) for those filesystems that
were mounted on host1:/test_mnt at the time of the dump, and
only those filesystems dumped to the media object labeled
&quot;tape 1&quot;.</p>

<p>Dump records may be removed (pruned) from the inventory
using the xfs- invutil program.</p>

<p>An additional media file is placed at the end of each
dump stream. This media file contains the inventory
information for the current dump session. Its contents may
be merged back into the online inventory database at a later
time using xfsrestore(1M).</p>

<p>The inventory files stored in /var/lib/xfsdump are not
included in the dump, even if that directory is contained
within the filesystem being dumped. Including the inventory
in the dump may lead to loss or cor- ruption of data, should
an older version be restored overwriting the current
version. To backup the xfsdump inventory, the contents of
/var/lib/xfsdump should be copied to another location which
may then be safely dumped. Upon restoration, those files may
be copied back into /var/lib/xfsdump, overwriting whatever
files may be there, or xfsinvu- til(1M) may be used to
selectively merge parts of the restored inven- tory back
into the current inventory. Prior to version 1.1.8, xfsdump
would include the /var/lib/xfsdump directory in the dump.
Care should be taken not to overwrite the /var/lib/xfsdump
directory when restoring an old dump, by either restoring
the filesystem to another location or by copying the current
contents of /var/lib/xfsdump to a safe place prior to
running xfsrestore(1M).</p>

<p>Labels The operator can specify a label to identify the
dump session and a label to identify a media object. The
session label is placed in every media file produced in the
course of the dump, and is recorded in the inventory.</p>

<p>The media label is used to identify media objects, and
is independent of the session label. Each media file on the
media object contains a copy of the media label. An error is
returned if the operator speci- fies a media label that does
not match the media label on a media object containing valid
media files. Media labels are recorded in the inventory.</p>

<p>UUIDs UUIDs (Universally Unique Identifiers) are used in
three places: to identify the filesystem being dumped (using
the filesystem UUID, see xfs(5) for more details), to
identify the dump session, and to identify each media
object. The inventory display (-I) includes all of
these.</p>

<p>Dump Level Usage The dump level mechanism provides a
structured form of incremental dumps. A dump of level level
includes only files that have changed since the most recent
dump at a level less than level. For example, the operator
can establish a dump schedule that involves a full dump
every Friday and a daily incremental dump containing only
files that have changed since the previous dump. In this
case Friday s dump would be at level 0, Saturdays at level
1, Sundays at level 2, and so on, up to the Thursday dump at
level 6.</p>

<p>The above schedule results in a very tedious restore
procedure to fully reconstruct the Thursday version of the
filesystem; xfsrestore would need to be fed all 7 dumps in
sequence. A compromise schedule is to use level 1 on
Saturday, Monday, and Wednesday, and level 2 on Sunday,
Tuesday, and Thursday. The Monday and Wednesday dumps would
take longer, but the worst case restore requires the
accumulation of just three dumps, one each at level 0, level
1, and level 2.</p>

<p>Quotas If the filesystem being dumped contains user
quotas, xfsdump will use xfs_quota(8) to store the quotas in
a file called xfsdump_quotas in the root of the filesystem
to be dumped. This file will then be included in the dump.
Upon restoration, xfs_quota (8) can be used to reactivate
the quotas for the filesystem. Note, however, that the
xfsdump_quotas file will probably require modification to
change the filesystem or UIDs if the filesystem has been
restored to a different partition or system. Group and
project quotas will be handled in a similar fashion and
saved in files called xfsdump_quotas_group and
xfsdump_quotas_proj , respectively.</p>

<p>Excluding individual files It may be desirable to
exclude particular files or directories from the dump. The
-s option can be used to limit the dump to a specified
directory, and the -z option can be used to exclude files
over a par- ticular size. Additionally, when xfsdump is run
with the -e option, files that are tagged with the &quot;no
dump&quot; file attribute will not be included in the dump.
The chattr(1) command can be used to set this attribute on
individual files or entire subtrees.</p>

<p>To tag an individual file for exclusion from the
dump:</p>

<p>$ chattr +d file</p>

<p>To tag all files in a subtree for exclusion from the
dump:</p>

<p>$ chattr -R +d directory</p>

<p>Note that any new files or directories created in a
directory which has the &quot;no dump&quot; attribute set
will automatically inherit this attribute. Also note that
xfsdump does not check directories for the &quot;no
dump&quot; attribute.</p>

<p>Care should be taken to note which files have been
tagged. Under nor- mal operation, xfsdump will only report
the number of files it will skip. The -v
excluded_files=debug option, however, will cause xfsdump to
list the inode numbers of the individual files affected.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES To perform a level 0, single stream dump of the
root filesystem to a locally mounted tape drive, prompting
for session and media labels when required:</p>

<p># xfsdump -f /dev/tape /</p>

<p>To specify session and media labels explicitly:</p>

<p># xfsdump -L session_1 -M tape_0 -f /dev/tape /</p>

<p>To perform a dump to a remote tape using the minimal rmt
protocol and a set blocksize of 64k:</p>

<p># xfsdump -m -b 65536 -f otherhost:/dev/tape /</p>

<p>To perform a level 0, multi-stream dump to two locally
mounted tape drives:</p>

<p># xfsdump -L session_2 -f /dev/rmt/tps4d6v -M tape_1 -f
/dev/rmt/tps5d6v -M tape_2 /</p>

<p>To perform a level 1 dump relative to the last level 0
dump recorded in the inventory:</p>

<p># xfsdump -l 1 -f /dev/tape /</p>

<p>To copy the contents of a filesystem to another
directory (see xfsre- store(8)):</p>

<p># xfsdump -J - / | xfsrestore -J - /new</p>

<p>FILES /var/lib/xfsdump/inventory dump inventory
database</p>

<p>SEE ALSO attr(1), rmt(8), xfsrestore(8), xfsinvutil(8),
xfs_quota(8), attr_get(2).</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS The exit code is 0 on normal completion,
non-zero if an error occurs or the dump is terminated by the
operator.</p>

<p>For all verbosity levels greater than 0 (silent) the
final line of the output shows the exit status of the dump.
It is of the form:</p>

<p>xfsdump: Dump Status: code</p>

<p>Where code takes one of the following values: SUCCESS
(normal comple- tion), INTERRUPT (interrupted), QUIT (media
no longer usable), INCOM- PLETE (dump incomplete), FAULT
(software error), and ERROR (resource error). Every attempt
will be made to keep both the syntax and the semantics of
this log message unchanged in future versions of xfsdump.
However, it may be necessary to refine or expand the set of
exit codes, or their interpretation at some point in the
future.</p>

<p>The message xfsdump: WARNING: unable to open directory:
ino N: Invalid argument can occur with filesystems which are
actively being modified while xfsdump is running. This can
happen to either directory or regular file inodes - affected
files will not end up in the dump, files below affected
directories will be placed in the orphanage direc- tory by
xfsrestore.</p>

<p>BUGS xfsdump does not dump unmounted filesystems.</p>

<p>The dump frequency field of /etc/fstab is not
supported.</p>

<p>xfsdump uses the alert program only when a media change
is required.</p>

<p>xfsdump requires root privilege (except for inventory
display).</p>

<p>xfsdump can only dump XFS filesystems.</p>

<p>The media format used by xfsdump can only be understood
by xfsrestore.</p>

<p>xfsdump does not know how to manage CD-ROM or other
removable disk drives.</p>

<p>xfsdump can become confused when doing incremental or
resumed dumps if on the same machine you dump two XFS
filesystems and both filesystems have the same filesystem
identifier (UUID). Since xfsdump uses the filesystem
identifier to identify filesystems, xfsdump maintains one
combined set of dump inventories for both filesystems
instead of two sets of dump inventories. This scenario can
happen only if dd or some other block-by-block copy program
was used to make a copy of an XFS filesystem. See
xfs_copy(8) and xfs(5) for more details.</p>
