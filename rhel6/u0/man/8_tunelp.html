<p>NAME tunelp - set various parameters for the lp
device</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS tunelp device [-i IRQ] [-t TIME] [-c CHARS] [-w
WAIT] [-a {on|off}] [-o {on|off}] [-C {on|off}] [-r] [-s]
[-q {on|off}] [-T {on|off}]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION tunelp sets several parameters for the
/dev/lp? devices, for better performance (or for any
performance at all, if your printer wont work without it...)
Without parameters, it tells whether the device is using
interrupts, and if so, which one. With parameters, it sets
the device characteristics accordingly. The parameters are
as follows:</p>

<p>-i IRQ specifies the IRQ to use for the parallel port in
question. If this is set to something non-zero, -t and -c
have no effect. If your port does not use interrupts, this
option will make print- ing stop. The command tunelp -i 0
restores non-interrupt driven (polling) action, and your
printer should work again. If your parallel port does
support interrupts, interrupt-driven printing should be
somewhat faster and efficient, and will probably be
desirable.</p>

<p>NOTE: This option will have no effect with kernel
2.1.131 or later since the irq is handled by the parport
driver. You can change the parport irq for example via
/proc/parport/*/irq. Read
/usr/src/linux/Documentation/parport.txt for more details on
parport.</p>

<p>-t TIME is the amount of time in jiffies that the driver
waits if the printer doesnt take a character for the number
of tries dic- tated by the -c parameter. 10 is the default
value. If you want fastest possible printing, and dont care
about system load, you may set this to 0. If you don t care
how fast your printer goes, or are printing text on a slow
printer with a buffer, then 500 (5 seconds) should be fine,
and will give you very low system load. This value generally
should be lower for printing graphics than text, by a factor
of approximately 10, for best performance.</p>

<p>-c CHARS is the number of times to try to output a
character to the printer before sleeping for -t TIME. It is
the number of times around a loop that tries to send a
character to the printer. 120 appears to be a good value for
most printers in polling mode. 1000 is the default, because
there are some printers that become jerky otherwise, but you
must set this to 1 to handle the maximal CPU efficiency if
you are using interrupts. If you have a very fast printer, a
value of 10 might make more sense even if in polling mode.
If you have a really old printer, you can increase this
further.</p>

<p>Setting -t TIME to 0 is equivalent to setting -c CHARS
to infin- ity.</p>

<p>-w WAIT is the number of usec we wait while playing with
the strobe sig- nal. While most printers appear to be able
to deal with an extremely short strobe, some printers demand
a longer one. Increasing this from the default 1 may make it
possible to print with those printers. This may also make it
possible to use longer cables. Its also possible to decrease
this value to 0 if your printer is fast enough or your
machine is slow enough.</p>

<p>-a {on|off} This is whether to abort on printer error -
the default is not to. If you are sitting at your computer,
you probably want to be able to see an error and fix it, and
have the printer go on printing. On the other hand, if you
arent, you might rather that your printer spooler find out
that the printer isnt ready, quit trying, and send you mail
about it. The choice is yours.</p>

<p>-o {on|off} This option is much like -a. It makes any
open() of this device check to see that the device is
on-line and not reporting any out of paper or other errors.
This is the correct setting for most versions of lpd.</p>

<p>-C {on|off} This option adds extra (&quot;careful&quot;)
error checking. When this option is on, the printer driver
will ensure that the printer is on-line and not reporting
any out of paper or other errors before sending data. This
is particularly useful for printers that normally appear to
accept data when turned off.</p>

<p>NOTE: This option is obsolete because its the default in
2.1.131 kernel or later.</p>

<p>-s This option returns the current printer status, both
as a deci- mal number from 0..255, and as a list of active
flags. When this option is specified, -q off, turning off
the display of the current IRQ, is implied.</p>

<p>-T {on|off} This option is obsolete. It was added in
Linux 2.1.131, and removed again in Linux 2.3.10. The below
is for these old ker- nels only.</p>

<p>This option tells the lp driver to trust or not the IRQ.
This option makes sense only if you are using interrupts. If
you tell the lp driver to trust the irq, then, when the lp
driver will get an irq, it will send the next pending
character to the printer unconditionally, even if the
printer still claims to be BUSY. This is the only way to
sleep on interrupt (and so the handle the irq printing
efficiently) at least on Epson Stylus Color Printers. The lp
driver automagically detects if you could get improved
performance by setting this flag, and in such case it will
warn you with a kernel message.</p>

<p>NOTE: Trusting the irq is reported to corrupt the
printing on some hardware, you must try to know if your
printer will work or not...</p>

<p>-r This option resets the port. It requires a Linux
kernel version of 1.1.80 or later.</p>

<p>-q {on|off} This option sets printing the display of the
current IRQ set- ting.</p>

<p>NOTES -o, -C, and -s all require a Linux kernel version
of 1.1.76 or later.</p>

<p>-C requires a Linux version prior to 2.1.131.</p>

<p>-T requires a Linux version of 2.1.131 or later.</p>

<p>BUGS By some unfortunate coincidence the ioctl LPSTRICT
of 2.0.36 has the same number as the ioctl LPTRUSTIRQ
introduced in 2.1.131. So, use of the -T option on a 2.0.36
kernel with an tunelp compiled under 2.1.131 or later may
have unexpected effects.</p>

<p>FILES /dev/lp? /proc/parport/*/*</p>

<p>AVAILABILITY The tunelp command is part of the
util-linux-ng package and is avail- able from
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux-ng/.</p>
