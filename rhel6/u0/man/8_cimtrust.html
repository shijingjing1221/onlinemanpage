<p>NAME cimtrust - Add, remove or list X509 certificates in
a PEM format trust store.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS cimtrust -a [ -U certuser ] -f file -T ( a | e
| s )</p>

<p>cimtrust -r -i issuer ( -n serialnumber | -S subject
)</p>

<p>cimtrust -l [ -i issuer [ -n serialnumber | -S subject ]
]</p>

<p>cimtrust --help</p>

<p>cimtrust --version</p>

<p>Remarks The cimtrust command requires that the cimserver
is running. This com- mand operates on a truststore on the
local system only.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The add option of the cimtrust command adds
an X509 certificate file of a specified type to the
truststore. The certuser specifies the user- name to be
associated with the certificate in the file. If no certuser
is specified, the certificate may not be used to
authenticate a user.</p>

<p>The remove option of the cimtrust command removes the
X509 certifi- cate(s) matching the specified issuer and
either serialnumber or sub- ject from the truststore.</p>

<p>The list option of the cimtrust command lists the X509
certificates in the truststore. The list can be filtered by
issuer and either serial- number or subject.</p>

<p>Certificates in the trust store may be revoked by adding
a Certificate Revocation List to the CRL store. For more
information on CRL opera- tions see the cimcrl(8)
command.</p>

<p>Options cimtrust recognizes the following options:</p>

<p>-a Adds a certificate to the truststore. If the
specified file does not contain a valid X509 cer- tificate
an error message is returned and no action is taken. If the
X509 certificate already exists in the truststore, an error
message is returned.</p>

<p>-r Removes certificate(s) from the truststore. If the
truststore contains multiple certificates matching the
specified issuer and subject, all the matching certificates
are removed. If no cer- tificate exists for the specified
issuer and either serialnumber or subject , an error message
is returned and no action is taken.</p>

<p>-l Displays the X509 certificates in the truststore.</p>

<p>-f file Specifies a PEM format file containing an X509
certificate.</p>

<p>-U certuser Specifies a username to be associated with
the specified certificate. The username specified should be
a valid system user on the target sys- tem.</p>

<p>-i issuer Specifies the issuer name of the
certificate.</p>

<p>-n serialnumber Specifies the serial number of the
certificate.</p>

<p>-S subject Specifies the subject name of the
certificate.</p>

<p>-T ( a | e | s ) Specifies the type of a certificate.
The type must be one of the following:</p>

<p>authority (a): root/intermediate authority cer-
tificates. Certificates of this type are added to the
trusted certificate store. The certuser is optional for
authority certificates. If no cer- tuser is specified, the
certificate may not be used to authenticate a user.</p>

<p>authority issued end-entity (e): Certificates of this
type are not added to the trusted certifi- cate store. The
certuser is required for author- ity issued end-entity
certificates.</p>

<p>Self-signed identity certificate (s): Certifi- cates of
this type are added to the trusted cer- tificate store. The
certuser is required for self-signed identity
certificates.</p>

<p>--help Displays the command help message.</p>

<p>--version Displays the CIM Server version.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS When an error occurs, an error message is
written to the standard error stream and a non-zero exit
status value is returned. The following exit status values
are defined:</p>

<p>0 Success</p>

<p>1 General error</p>

<p>2 Connection failed</p>

<p>3 Connection timed out</p>

<p>4 Certificate already exists</p>

<p>5 Certificate does not exist</p>

<p>6 Invalid system user</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Add the X509 self-signed identity certificate
in the cert.pem file and associate it to certuser guest.
This certificate will be added to the trusted certificate
store:</p>

<p>cimtrust -a -U guest -f cert.pem -T s</p>

<p>Add the X509 authority root CA certificate in the ca.pem
file with no certuser association. This certificate will be
added to the trusted certificate store but may not be used
to authenticate a user:</p>

<p>cimtrust -a -f ca.pem -T a</p>

<p>Add the X509 authority issued end-entity certificate in
the user.pem file and associate it to certuser pegasus. This
certificate may be used to authenticate user pegasus but
will not be added to the trusted cer- tificate store:</p>

<p>cimtrust -a -f user.pem -U pegasus -T e</p>

<p>Remove the certificate matching the specified issuer and
serialnumber from the trust store:</p>

<p>cimtrust -r -i
&quot;/C=US/ST=California/L=Cupertino/O=Smart &amp;
Secure/OU=Secure Software Division/CN=dev.admin.ss.com&quot;
-n 01</p>

<p>Remove the certificate(s) matching the specified issuer
and subject from the trust store:</p>

<p>cimtrust -r -i
&quot;/C=US/ST=California/L=Cupertino/O=Smart &amp;
Secure/OU=Secure Software Division/CN=dev.admin.ss.com&quot;
-S &quot;/C=US/ST=California/L=Cupertino/O=Smart &amp;
Secure/OU=Secure Software
Division/CN=dev.admin.ss.com&quot;</p>

<p>List all the X509 certificates in the trust store:</p>

<p>cimtrust -l</p>
