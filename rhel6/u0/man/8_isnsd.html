<p>NAME isnsd - iSNS server daemon</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS isnsd [-f] [-4] [-6] [-c filename] [-d
debug-facility] [--dump-db] [--init]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Isnsd implements the iSNS protocol as
defined in RFC 4171. iSNS is a discovery protocol for iSCSI
and iFCP.</p>

<p>OPTIONS By default, isnsd will take most of its settings
from the configuration file /etc/isns/isnsd.conf, with the
exception of the following options:</p>

<p>--config filename, -c filename This option overrides the
default configuration file.</p>

<p>--foreground,-f By default, isnsd will put itself into
the background. By speci- fying this option, you can tell it
to run in the foreground. Any error messages or debug output
will be printed to the console rather than being sent to
syslog.</p>

<p>-4 tells isnsd to create an IPv4 socket only. Normally,
it defaults to IPv6 (which will accept both IPv4 and IPv6
connections).</p>

<p>-6 tells isnsd explicitly to create an IPv6 socket only.
Since it defaults to IPv6 anyway, this is really a
no-op.</p>

<p>--debug facility, -d facility enables debugging. Valid
facilities are</p>


<p>+--------+-----------------------------------------------------+
|socket | network send/receive | |auth | authentication and
security related information | |message | iSNS protocol
layer | |state | database state | |scn | SCN (state change
notification) messages | |esi | ESI (entity status inquiry)
messages | |all | all of the above |
+--------+-----------------------------------------------------+</p>

<p>--dump-db This is a helper function that will read the
database from the file system, and display it in human
readable form. When using this option, isnsd will not open
any sockets, and terminate immediately after display the
database.</p>

<p>This option is intended to be used by the administrator
when suspecting that the database contains bad/inconsistent
informa- tion.</p>

<p>--init This option will create the servers
authentication key, and the required DSA parameters. The
private key is stored in the file specified by the AuthKey
option (usually /etc/isns/auth_key). The public portion of
the key is written to same directory, with the suffix .pub
appended to the key file name.</p>
