<p>TROFF(1) TROFF(1)</p>

<p>NAME troff - the troff processor of the groff text
formatting system</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS troff [ -abcivzCERU ] [ -dcs ] [ -ffam ] [
-Fdir ] [ -mname ] [ -Mdir ] [ -nnum ] [ -olist ] [ -rcn ] [
-Tname ] [ -wname ] [ -Wname ] [ files... ]</p>

<p>It is possible to have whitespace between a command line
option and its parameter.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page describes the GNU version
of troff. It is part of the groff document formatting
system. It is functionally compatible with UNIX troff, but
has many extensions, see groff_diff(7). Usually it should be
invoked using the groff(1) command which will also run pre-
processors and postprocessors in the appropriate order and
with the appropriate options.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -a Generate an ASCII approximation of the
typeset output.</p>

<p>-b Print a backtrace with each warning or error message.
This backtrace should help track down the cause of the
error. The line numbers given in the backtrace may not
always be cor- rect, for troff s idea of line numbers gets
confused by as or am requests.</p>

<p>-c Disable color output (always disabled in
compatibility mode).</p>

<p>-C Enable compatibility mode.</p>

<p>-dcs -dname=s Define c or name to be a string s; c must
be a one letter name.</p>

<p>-E Inhibit all error messages of troff. Note that this
doesnt affect messages output to standard error by macro
packages using the tm or tm1 requests.</p>

<p>-ffam Use fam as the default font family.</p>

<p>-Fdir Search in directory (or directory path) dir for
subdirecto- ries devname (name is the name of the device)
and there for the DESC file and font files. dir is scanned
before all other font directories.</p>

<p>-i Read the standard input after all the named input
files have been processed.</p>

<p>-mname Read in the file name.tmac. If it isn t found,
try tmac.name instead. It will be first searched for in
directories given with the -M command line option, then in
directories given in the GROFF_TMAC_PATH environment
variable, then in the current directory (only if in unsafe
mode), the home directory, /usr/lib64/groff/site-tmac,
/usr/share/groff/site-tmac, and
/usr/share/groff/1.18.1.4/tmac.</p>

<p>-Mdir Search directory (or directory path) dir for macro
files. This is scanned before all other macro
directories.</p>

<p>-nnum Number the first page num.</p>

<p>-olist Output only pages in list, which is a
comma-separated list of page ranges; n means print page n,
m-n means print every page between m and n, -n means print
every page up to n, n- means print every page from n. troff
will exit after printing the last page in the list.</p>

<p>-rcn -rname=n Set number register c or name to n; c must
be a one character name; n can be any troff numeric
expression.</p>

<p>-R Dont load troffrc and troffrc-end.</p>

<p>-Tname Prepare output for device name, rather than the
default ps.</p>

<p>-U Unsafe mode. This will enable the following requests:
open, opena, pso, sy, and pi. For security reasons, these
poten- tially dangerous requests are disabled otherwise. It
will also add the current directory to the macro search
path.</p>

<p>-v Print the version number.</p>

<p>-wname Enable warning name. Available warnings are
described in the section WARNINGS below. For example, to
enable all warnings, use -w all. Multiple -w options are
allowed.</p>

<p>-Wname Inhibit warning name. Multiple -W options are
allowed.</p>

<p>-z Suppress formatted output.</p>

<p>WARNINGS The warnings that can be given by troff are
divided into the following categories. The name associated
with each warning is used by the -w and -W options; the
number is used by the warn request, and by the .warn
register; it is always a power of 2 to allow bitwise
composition.</p>

<p>+---------------------+----------------------------+
|Bit Code Warning | Bit Code Warning |
+---------------------+----------------------------+ | 0 1
char | 10 1024 reg | | 1 2 number | 11 2048 tab | | 2 4
break | 12 4096 right-brace | | 3 8 delim | 13 8192 missing
| | 4 16 el | 14 16384 input | | 5 32 scale | 15 32768
escape | | 6 64 range | 16 65536 space | | 7 128 syntax | 17
131072 font | | 8 256 di | 18 262144 ig | | 9 512 mac | 19
524288 color |
+---------------------+----------------------------+</p>

<p>break 4 In fill mode, lines which could not be broken so
that their length was less than the line length. This is
enabled by default.</p>

<p>char 1 Non-existent characters. This is enabled by
default.</p>

<p>color 524288 Color related warnings.</p>

<p>delim 8 Missing or mismatched closing delimiters.</p>

<p>di 256 Use of di or da without an argument when there is
no current diversion.</p>

<p>el 16 Use of the el request with no matching ie
request.</p>

<p>escape 32768 Unrecognized escape sequences. When an
unrecog- nized escape sequence is encountered, the escape
character is ignored.</p>

<p>font 131072 Non-existent fonts. This is enabled by
default.</p>

<p>ig 262144 Invalid escapes in text ignored with the ig
request. These are conditions that are errors when they do
not occur in ignored text.</p>

<p>input 16384 Invalid input characters.</p>

<p>mac 512 Use of undefined strings, macros and diversions.
When an undefined string, macro or diversion is used, that
string is automatically defined as empty. So, in most cases,
at most one warning will be given for each name.</p>

<p>missing 8192 Requests that are missing non-optional
arguments.</p>

<p>number 2 Invalid numeric expressions. This is enabled by
default.</p>

<p>range 64 Out of range arguments.</p>

<p>reg 1024 Use of undefined number registers. When an
unde- fined number register is used, that register is
automatically defined to have a value of 0. So, in most
cases, at most one warning will be given for use of a
particular name.</p>

<p>right-brace 4096 Use o} where a number was expected.</p>

<p>scale 32 Meaningless scaling indicators.</p>

<p>space 65536 Missing space between a request or macro and
its argument. This warning will be given when an unde- fined
name longer than two characters is encoun- tered, and the
first two characters of the name make a defined name. The
request or macro will not be invoked. When this warning is
given, no macro is automatically defined. This is enabled by
default. This warning will never occur in compati- bility
mode.</p>

<p>syntax 128 Dubious syntax in numeric expressions.</p>

<p>tab 2048 Inappropriate use of a tab character. Either
use of a tab character where a number was expected, or use
of tab character in an unquoted macro argument.</p>

<p>There are also names that can be used to refer to groups
of warnings:</p>

<p>all All warnings except di, mac, and reg. It is intended
that this covers all warnings that are useful with
traditional macro pack- ages.</p>

<p>w All warnings.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT GROFF_TMAC_PATH A colon separated list of
directories in which to search for macro files. troff will
scan directories given in the -M option before these, and in
standard directories (current directory if in unsafe mode,
home directory, /usr/lib64/groff/site-tmac,
/usr/share/groff/site-tmac, /usr/share/groff/1.18.1.4/tmac)
after these.</p>

<p>GROFF_TYPESETTER Default device.</p>

<p>GROFF_FONT_PATH A colon separated list of directories in
which to search for the devname directory. troff will scan
directories given in the -F option before these, and in
standard directories (/usr/share/groff/site-font,
/usr/share/groff/1.18.1.4/font, /usr/lib/font) after
these.</p>

<p>FILES /usr/share/groff/1.18.1.4/tmac/troffrc
Initialization file (called before any other macro
package).</p>

<p>/usr/share/groff/1.18.1.4/tmac/troffrc-end
Initialization file (called after any other macro
package).</p>

<p>/usr/share/groff/1.18.1.4/tmac/name.tmac
/usr/share/groff/1.18.1.4/tmac/tmac.name Macro files</p>

<p>/usr/share/groff/1.18.1.4/font/devname/DESC Device
description file for device name.</p>

<p>/usr/share/groff/1.18.1.4/font/devname/F Font file for
font F of device name.</p>

<p>Note that troffrc and troffrc-end are neither searched
in the current nor in the home directory by default for
security reasons (even if the -U option is given). Use the
-M command line option or the GROFF_TMAC_PATH environment
variable to add these directories to the search path if
necessary.</p>
