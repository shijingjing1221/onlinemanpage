<p>XIGRABENTER(3) [FIXME: manual] XIGRABENTER(3)</p>

<p>NAME XIGrabEnter, XIUngrabEnter, XIGrabFocusIn,
XIUngrabFocusIn - grab/ungrab enter or focus in events.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;X11/extensions/XInput.h&gt;</p>

<p>int XIGrabEnter( Display *display, int deviceid, Window
grab_window Cursor cursor, int grab_mode, int
paired_device_mode, Bool owner_events, XIEventMask *mask,
int num_modifiers, XIGrabModifiers *modifiers_inout);</p>

<p>int XIUngrabEnter( Display *display, int deviceid,
Window grab_window int num_modifiers, XIGrabModifiers
*modifiers);</p>

<p>int XIGrabFocusIn ( Display *display, int deviceid,
Window grab_window int grab_mode, int paired_device_mode,
Bool owner_events, XIEventMask *mask, int num_modifiers,
XIGrabModifiers *modifiers_inout);</p>

<p>int XIUngrabFocusIn( Display *display, int deviceid,
Window grab_window int num_modifiers, XIGrabModifiers
*modifiers); display Specifies the connection to the X
server.</p>

<p>device Specifies the device that is to be grabbed or
released</p>

<p>num_modifiers Number of elements in modifiers or
modifiers_return</p>

<p>modifiers Specifies the set of latched and base
modifiers or XIAnyModifier to ungrab. The data type is for
consistency with the respective grab request and the status
code of the XIGrabModifiers struct is ignored.</p>

<p>modifiers_inout Specifies the set of latched and base
modifiers or XIAnyModifier to grab. Returns the modifiers
that could not be grabbed and their status code.</p>

<p>grab_window Specifies the grab window.</p>

<p>owner_events Specifies a Boolean value that indicates
whether the are to be reported as usual or reported with
respect to the grab window.</p>

<p>mask Specifies the event mask.</p>

<p>grab_mode Specifies further processing of events from
this device. You can pass GrabModeSync or GrabModeAsync.</p>

<p>paired_device_mode Specifies further processing of
events from the paired master device. You can pass
GrabModeSync or GrabModeAsync. If deviceid specifies a
floating slave device, this parameter is ignored.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION XIGrabEnter and XIGrabFocusIn establish a
passive grab. The modifier device for a enter grab is the
paired master device if deviceid specifies a master pointer.
Otherwise, the modifier device is the device specified with
deviceid.</p>

<p>For XIGrabEnter and XIGrabFocusIn, in the future, the
device is actively grabbed (as for XIGrabDevice, the
last-grab time is set to the time at which the pointer/focus
entered window) if the device is not grabbed and the pointer
has entered the grab_window or the focus has been set to the
grab_window when the specified modifier keys are logically
down on the modifier device and no other buttons or modifier
keys are logically down.</p>

<p>The interpretation of the remaining arguments is as for
XIGrabDevice. The active grab is terminated automatically
when the pointer leaves the window or the focus is set to a
different window (independent of the logical state of the
modifier keys).</p>

<p>If the device is an attached slave device, the device is
automatically detached from the master device when the grab
activates and reattached to the same master device when the
grab deactivates. If the master device is removed while the
device is floating as a result of a grab, the device remains
floating once the grab deactivates.</p>

<p>Note that the logical state of a device (as seen by
client applications) may lag the physical state if device
event processing is frozen.</p>

<p>This request overrides all previous grabs by the same
client of the same type and modifier combinations on the
same window. A modifiers of XIAnyModifier is equivalent to
issuing the grab request for all possible modifier
combinations (including the combination of no modifiers). It
is not required that all modifiers specified have currently
assigned KeyCodes.</p>

<p>If some other client has already issued a XIGrabEnter or
XIGrabFocusIn on the same window, a BadAccess error results.
When using XIAnyModifier, the request fails completely, and
a XIBadAccess error results (no grabs are established) if
there is a conflicting grab for any combination. XIGrabEnter
and XIGrabFocusin have no effect on an active grab.</p>

<p>XIGrabEnter and XIGrabFocusIn can generate BadDevice,
BadMatch, BadValue, and BadWindow errors.</p>

<p>XIUngrabEnter and XIUngrabFocusIn releases the passive
grab on the specified window if it was grabbed by this
client. A modifier of XIAnyModifier is equivalent to issuing
the ungrab request for all possible modifier combinations,
including the combination of no modifiers. XIUngrabEnter and
XIUngrabFocusIn have no effect on an active grab.</p>

<p>XIUngrabEnter and XIUngrabFocusIn can generate
BadDevice, BadMatch, BadValue and BadWindow errors.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS BadDevice An invalid deviceid was
specified.</p>

<p>BadMatch This error may occur if XIGrabEnter specified a
device that has no valuators, or XIGrabFocusIn specified a
device that has no keys.</p>

<p>BadValue Some numeric value falls outside the range of
values accepted by the request. Unless a specific range is
specified for an argument, the full range defined by the
argument&acute;s type is accepted. Any argument defined as a
set of alternatives can generate this error.</p>

<p>BadWindow A value for a Window argument does not name a
defined Window.</p>
