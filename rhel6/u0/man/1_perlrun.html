]...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The normal way to run a Perl program is by
making it directly executable, or else by passing the name
of the source file as an argument on the command line. (An
interactive Perl environment is also possible--see perldebug
for details on how to do that.) Upon startup, Perl looks for
your program in one of the following places:</p>

<p>1. Specified line by line via -e or -E switches on the
command line.</p>

<p>2. Contained in the file specified by the first filename
on the command line. (Note that systems supporting the #!
notation invoke interpreters this way. See &quot;Location of
Perl&quot;.)</p>

<p>3. Passed in implicitly via standard input. This works
only if there are no filename arguments--to pass arguments
to a STDIN-read program you must explicitly specify a
&quot;-&quot; for the program name.</p>

<p>With methods 2 and 3, Perl starts parsing the input file
from the beginning, unless you ve specified a -x switch, in
which case it scans for the first line starting with #! and
containing the word &quot;perl&quot;, and starts there
instead. This is useful for running a program embedded in a
larger message. (In this case you would indicate the end of
the program using the &quot;__END__&quot; token.)</p>

<p>The #! line is always examined for switches as the line
is being parsed. Thus, if youre on a machine that allows
only one argument with the #! line, or worse, doesnt even
recognize the #! line, you still can get consistent switch
behavior regardless of how Perl was invoked, even if -x was
used to find the beginning of the program.</p>

<p>Because historically some operating systems silently
chopped off kernel interpretation of the #! line after 32
characters, some switches may be passed in on the command
line, and some may not; you could even get a &quot;-&quot;
without its letter, if you re not careful. You probably want
to make sure that all your switches fall either before or
after that 32-character boundary. Most switches dont
actually care if theyre processed redundantly, but getting a
&quot;-&quot; instead of a complete switch could cause Perl
to try to execute standard input instead of your program.
And a partial -I switch could also cause odd results.</p>

<p>Some switches do care if they are processed twice, for
instance combinations of -l and -0. Either put all the
switches after the 32-character boundary (if applicable), or
replace the use of -0digits by &quot;BEGIN{ $/ = &quot;
digits&quot;; }&quot;.</p>

<p>Parsing of the #! switches starts wherever
&quot;perl&quot; is mentioned in the line. The sequences
&quot;-*&quot; and &quot;- &quot; are specifically ignored
so that you could, if you were so inclined, say</p>

<p>#!/bin/sh #! -*-perl-*- eval &rsquo;exec perl -x -wS $0
${1+&quot;$@&quot;}&rsquo; if 0;</p>

<p>to let Perl see the -p switch.</p>

<p>A similar trick involves the env program, if you have
it.</p>

<p>#!/usr/bin/env perl</p>

<p>The examples above use a relative path to the perl
interpreter, getting whatever version is first in the users
path. If you want a specific version of Perl, say,
perl5.005_57, you should place that directly in the #! lines
path.</p>

<p>If the #! line does not contain the word
&quot;perl&quot;, the program named after the #! is executed
instead of the Perl interpreter. This is slightly bizarre,
but it helps people on machines that don t do #!, because
they can tell a program that their SHELL is /usr/bin/perl,
and Perl will then dispatch the program to the correct
interpreter for them.</p>

<p>After locating your program, Perl compiles the entire
program to an internal form. If there are any compilation
errors, execution of the program is not attempted. (This is
unlike the typical shell script, which might run part-way
through before finding a syntax error.)</p>

<p>If the program is syntactically correct, it is executed.
If the program runs off the end without hitting an exit() or
die() operator, an implicit exit(0) is provided to indicate
successful completion.</p>

<p>#! and quoting on non-Unix systems Unixs #! technique
can be simulated on other systems:</p>

<p>OS/2 Put</p>

<p>extproc perl -S -your_switches</p>

<p>as the first line in &quot;*.cmd&quot; file (-S due to a
bug in cmd.exes extproc handling).</p>

<p>MS-DOS Create a batch file to run your program, and
codify it in &quot;ALTERNATE_SHEBANG&quot; (see the dosish.h
file in the source distribution for more information).</p>

<p>Win95/NT The Win95/NT installation, when using the
ActiveState installer for Perl, will modify the Registry to
associate the .pl extension with the perl interpreter. If
you install Perl by other means (including building from the
sources), you may have to modify the Registry yourself. Note
that this means you can no longer tell the difference
between an executable Perl program and a Perl library
file.</p>

<p>Macintosh Under &quot;Classic&quot; MacOS, a perl
program will have the appropriate Creator and Type, so that
double-clicking them will invoke the MacPerl application.
Under Mac OS X, clickable apps can be made from any
&quot;#!&quot; script using Wil Sanchez DropScript utility:
http://www.wsanchez.net/software/ .</p>

<p>VMS Put</p>

<p>$ perl -mysw &rsquo;f$env(&quot;procedure&quot;)&rsquo;
&rsquo;p1&rsquo; &rsquo;p2&rsquo; &rsquo;p3&rsquo;
&rsquo;p4&rsquo; &rsquo;p5&rsquo; &rsquo;p6&rsquo;
&rsquo;p7&rsquo; &rsquo;p8&rsquo; ! $ exit++ + ++$status !=
0 and $exit = $status = undef;</p>

<p>at the top of your program, where -mysw are any command
line switches you want to pass to Perl. You can now invoke
the program directly, by saying &quot;perl program&quot;, or
as a DCL procedure, by saying @program (or implicitly via
DCL$PATH by just using the name of the program).</p>

<p>This incantation is a bit much to remember, but Perl
will display it for you if you say &quot;perl
&quot;-V:startperl&quot;&quot;.</p>

<p>Command-interpreters on non-Unix systems have rather
different ideas on quoting than Unix shells. Youll need to
learn the special characters in your command-interpreter
(&quot;*&quot;, &quot; protect whitespace and these
characters to run one-liners (see -e below).</p>

<p>On some systems, you may have to change single-quotes to
double ones, which you must not do on Unix or Plan 9
systems. You might also have to change a single % to a
%%.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p># Unix perl -e &rsquo;print &quot;Hello
world0&rsquo;</p>

<p># MS-DOS, etc. perl -e &quot;print</p>

<p># Macintosh print &quot;Hello world0 (then Run
&quot;Myscript&quot; or Shift-Command-R)</p>

<p># VMS perl -e &quot;print &quot;&quot;Hello
world0&quot;&quot;</p>

<p>The problem is that none of this is reliable: it depends
on the command and it is entirely possible neither works. If
4DOS were the command shell, this would probably work
better:</p>

<p>perl -e &quot;print &lt;Ctrl-x&gt;&quot;Hello
world0Ctrl-x&gt;&quot;&quot;</p>

<p>CMD.EXE in Windows NT slipped a lot of standard Unix
functionality in when nobody was looking, but just try to
find documentation for its quoting rules.</p>

<p>Under the Macintosh, it depends which environment you
are using. The MacPerl shell, or MPW, is much like Unix
shells in its support for several quoting variants, except
that it makes free use of the Macintoshs non-ASCII
characters as control characters.</p>

<p>There is no general solution to all of this. Its just a
mess.</p>

<p>Location of Perl It may seem obvious to say, but Perl is
useful only when users can easily find it. When possible, it
s good for both /usr/bin/perl and /usr/local/bin/perl to be
symlinks to the actual binary. If that cant be done, system
administrators are strongly encouraged to put (symlinks to)
perl and its accompanying utilities into a directory
typically found along a users PATH, or in some other obvious
and convenient place.</p>

<p>In this documentation, &quot;#!/usr/bin/perl&quot; on
the first line of the program will stand in for whatever
method works on your system. You are advised to use a
specific path if you care about a specific version.</p>

<p>#!/usr/local/bin/perl5.00554</p>

<p>or if you just want to be running at least version,
place a statement like this at the top of your program:</p>

<p>use 5.005_54;</p>

<p>Command Switches As with all standard commands, a
single-character switch may be clustered with the following
switch, if any.</p>

<p>#!/usr/bin/perl -spi.orig # same as -s -p -i.orig</p>

<p>Switches include:</p>

<p>-0[octal/hexadecimal] specifies the input record
separator ($/) as an octal or hexadecimal number. If there
are no digits, the null character is the separator. Other
switches may precede or follow the digits. For example, if
you have a version of find which can print filenames
terminated by the null character, you can say this:</p>

<p>find . -name &rsquo;*.orig&rsquo; -print0 | perl -n0e
unlink</p>

<p>The special value 00 will cause Perl to slurp files in
paragraph mode. The value 0777 will cause Perl to slurp
files whole because there is no legal byte with that
value.</p>

<p>If you want to specify any Unicode character, use the
hexadecimal format: &quot;-0xHHH...&quot;, where the
&quot;H&quot; are valid hexadecimal digits. (This means that
you cannot use the &quot;-x&quot; with a directory name that
consists of hexadecimal digits.)</p>

<p>-a turns on autosplit mode when used with a -n or -p. An
implicit split command to the @F array is done as the first
thing inside the implicit while loop produced by the -n or
-p.</p>

<p>perl -ane &rsquo;print pop(@F), &quot;0;&rsquo;</p>

<p>is equivalent to</p>

<p>while (&lt;&gt;) { @F = split(&rsquo; &rsquo;); print
pop(@F), &quot;0; }</p>

<p>An alternate delimiter may be specified using -F.</p>

<p>-C [number/list] The &quot;-C&quot; flag controls some
of the Perl Unicode features.</p>

<p>As of 5.8.1, the &quot;-C&quot; can be followed either
by a number or a list of option letters. The letters, their
numeric values, and effects are as follows; listing the
letters is equal to summing the numbers.</p>

<p>I 1 STDIN is assumed to be in UTF-8 O 2 STDOUT will be
in UTF-8 E 4 STDERR will be in UTF-8 S 7 I + O + E i 8 UTF-8
is the default PerlIO layer for input streams o 16 UTF-8 is
the default PerlIO layer for output streams D 24 i + o A 32
the @ARGV elements are expected to be strings encoded in
UTF-8 L 64 normally the &quot;IOEioA&quot; are
unconditional, the L makes them conditional on the locale
environment variables (the LC_ALL, LC_TYPE, and LANG, in the
order of decreasing precedence) -- if the variables indicate
UTF-8, then the selected &quot;IOEioA&quot; are in effect a
256 Set ${^UTF8CACHE} to -1, to run the UTF-8 caching code
in debugging mode.</p>

<p>For example, &quot;-COE&quot; and &quot;-C6&quot; will
both turn on UTF-8-ness on both STDOUT and STDERR. Repeating
letters is just redundant, not cumulative nor toggling.</p>

<p>The &quot;io&quot; options mean that any subsequent
open() (or similar I/O operations) will have the
&quot;:utf8&quot; PerlIO layer implicitly applied to them,
in other words, UTF-8 is expected from any input stream, and
UTF-8 is produced to any output stream. This is just the
default, with explicit layers in open() and with binmode()
one can manipulate streams as usual.</p>

<p>&quot;-C&quot; on its own (not followed by any number or
option list), or the empty string &quot;&quot; for the
&quot;PERL_UNICODE&quot; environment variable, has the same
effect as &quot;-CSDL&quot;. In other words, the standard
I/O handles and the default &quot;open()&quot; layer are
UTF-8-fied but only if the locale environment variables
indicate a UTF-8 locale. This behaviour follows the implicit
(and problematic) UTF-8 behaviour of Perl 5.8.0.</p>

<p>You can use &quot;-C0&quot; (or &quot;0&quot; for
&quot;PERL_UNICODE&quot;) to explicitly disable all the
above Unicode features.</p>

<p>The read-only magic variable &quot;${^UNICODE}&quot;
reflects the numeric value of this setting. This is variable
is set during Perl startup and is thereafter read-only. If
you want runtime effects, use the three-arg open() (see
&quot;open&quot; in perlfunc), the two-arg binmode() (see
&quot;binmode&quot; in perlfunc), and the &quot;open&quot;
pragma (see open).</p>

<p>(In Perls earlier than 5.8.1 the &quot;-C&quot; switch
was a Win32-only switch that enabled the use of
Unicode-aware &quot;wide system call&quot; Win32 APIs. This
feature was practically unused, however, and the command
line switch was therefore &quot;recycled&quot;.)</p>

<p>Note: Since perl 5.10.1, if the -C option is used on the
#! line, it must be specified on the command line as well,
since the standard streams are already set up at this point
in the execution of the perl interpreter. You can also use
binmode() to set the encoding of an I/O stream.</p>

<p>-c causes Perl to check the syntax of the program and
then exit without executing it. Actually, it will execute
&quot;BEGIN&quot;, &quot;UNITCHECK&quot;, &quot;CHECK&quot;,
and &quot;use&quot; blocks, because these are considered as
occurring outside the execution of your program.
&quot;INIT&quot; and &quot;END&quot; blocks, however, will
be skipped.</p>

<p>-d -dt runs the program under the Perl debugger. See
perldebug. If t is specified, it indicates to the debugger
that threads will be used in the code being debugged.</p>

<p>-d:foo[=bar,baz] -dt:foo[=bar,baz] runs the program
under the control of a debugging, profiling, or tracing
module installed as Devel::foo. E.g., -d:DProf executes the
program using the Devel::DProf profiler. As with the -M
flag, options may be passed to the Devel::foo package where
they will be received and interpreted by the
Devel::foo::import routine. The comma-separated list of
options must follow a &quot;=&quot; character. If t is
specified, it indicates to the debugger that threads will be
used in the code being debugged. See perldebug.</p>

<p>-Dletters -Dnumber sets debugging flags. To watch how it
executes your program, use -Dtls. (This works only if
debugging is compiled into your Perl.) Another nice value is
-Dx, which lists your compiled syntax tree. And -Dr displays
compiled regular expressions; the format of the output is
explained in perldebguts.</p>

<p>As an alternative, specify a number instead of list of
letters (e.g., -D14 is equivalent to -Dtls):</p>

<p>1 p Tokenizing and parsing (with v, displays parse
stack) 2 s Stack snapshots (with v, displays all stacks) 4 l
Context (loop) stack processing 8 t Trace execution 16 o
Method and overloading resolution 32 c String/numeric
conversions 64 P Print profiling info, preprocessor command
for -P, source file input state 128 m Memory and SV
allocation 256 f Format processing 512 r Regular expression
parsing and execution 1024 x Syntax tree dump 2048 u
Tainting checks 4096 U Unofficial, User hacking (reserved
for private, unreleased use) 8192 H Hash dump -- usurps
values() 16384 X Scratchpad allocation 32768 D Cleaning up
65536 S Thread synchronization 131072 T Tokenising 262144 R
Include reference counts of dumped variables (eg when using
-Ds) 524288 J Do not s,t,P-debug (Jump over) opcodes within
package DB 1048576 v Verbose: use in conjunction with other
flags 2097152 C Copy On Write 4194304 A Consistency checks
on internal structures 8388608 q quiet - currently only
suppresses the &quot;EXECUTING&quot; message</p>

<p>All these flags require -DDEBUGGING when you compile the
Perl executable (but see Devel::Peek, re which may change
this). See the INSTALL file in the Perl source distribution
for how to do this. This flag is automatically set if you
include -g option when &quot;Configure&quot; asks you about
optimizer/debugger flags.</p>

<p>If youre just trying to get a print out of each line of
Perl code as it executes, the way that &quot;sh -x&quot;
provides for shell scripts, you cant use Perls -D switch.
Instead do this</p>

<p># If you have &quot;env&quot; utility env
PERLDB_OPTS=&quot;NonStop=1 AutoTrace=1 frame=2&quot; perl
-dS program</p>

<p># Bourne shell syntax $ PERLDB_OPTS=&quot;NonStop=1
AutoTrace=1 frame=2&quot; perl -dS program</p>

<p># csh syntax % (setenv PERLDB_OPTS &quot;NonStop=1
AutoTrace=1 frame=2&quot;; perl -dS program)</p>

<p>See perldebug for details and variations.</p>

<p>-e commandline may be used to enter one line of program.
If -e is given, Perl will not look for a filename in the
argument list. Multiple -e commands may be given to build up
a multi-line script. Make sure to use semicolons where you
would in a normal program.</p>

<p>-E commandline behaves just like -e, except that it
implicitly enables all optional features (in the main
compilation unit). See feature.</p>

<p>-f Disable executing $Config{sitelib}/sitecustomize.pl
at startup.</p>

<p>Perl can be built so that it by default will try to
execute $Config{sitelib}/sitecustomize.pl at startup (in a
BEGIN block). This is a hook that allows the sysadmin to
customize how perl behaves. It can for instance be used to
add entries to the @INC array to make perl find modules in
non-standard locations.</p>

<p>-Fpattern specifies the pattern to split on if -a is
also in effect. The pattern may be surrounded by
&quot;//&quot;, &quot;&quot;, or &rsquo;&rsquo;, otherwise
it will be put in single quotes. You cant use literal
whitespace in the pattern.</p>

<p>-h prints a summary of the options.</p>

<p>-i[extension] specifies that files processed by the
&quot;&lt;&gt;&quot; construct are to be edited in-place. It
does this by renaming the input file, opening the output
file by the original name, and selecting that output file as
the default for print() statements. The extension, if
supplied, is used to modify the name of the old file to make
a backup copy, following these rules:</p>

<p>If no extension is supplied, no backup is made and the
current file is overwritten.</p>

<p>If the extension doesnt contain a &quot;*&quot;, then it
is appended to the end of the current filename as a suffix.
If the extension does contain one or more &quot;*&quot;
characters, then each &quot;*&quot; is replaced with the
current filename. In Perl terms, you could think of this
as:</p>

<p>($backup = $extension) =~ s/$file_name/g;</p>

<p>This allows you to add a prefix to the backup file,
instead of (or in addition to) a suffix:</p>

<p>$ perl -pi&rsquo;orig_*&rsquo; -e
&rsquo;s/bar/baz/&rsquo; fileA # backup to
&rsquo;orig_fileA&rsquo;</p>

<p>Or even to place backup copies of the original files
into another directory (provided the directory already
exists):</p>

<p>$ perl -pi&rsquo;old/*.orig&rsquo; -e
&rsquo;s/bar/baz/&rsquo; fileA # backup to
&rsquo;old/fileA.orig&rsquo;</p>

<p>These sets of one-liners are equivalent:</p>

<p>$ perl -pi -e &rsquo;s/bar/baz/&rsquo; fileA # overwrite
current file $ perl -pi&rsquo;*&rsquo; -e
&rsquo;s/bar/baz/&rsquo; fileA # overwrite current file</p>

<p>$ perl -pi&rsquo;.orig&rsquo; -e
&rsquo;s/bar/baz/&rsquo; fileA # backup to
&rsquo;fileA.orig&rsquo; $ perl -pi&rsquo;*.orig&rsquo; -e
&rsquo;s/bar/baz/&rsquo; fileA # backup to
&rsquo;fileA.orig&rsquo;</p>

<p>From the shell, saying</p>

<p>$ perl -p -i.orig -e &quot;s/foo/bar/; ... &quot;</p>

<p>is the same as using the program:</p>

<p>#!/usr/bin/perl -pi.orig s/foo/bar/;</p>

<p>which is equivalent to</p>

<p>#!/usr/bin/perl $extension = &rsquo;.orig&rsquo;; LINE:
while (&lt;&gt;) { if ($ARGV ne $oldargv) { if ($extension
!~ /) { $backup = $ARGV . $extension; } else { ($backup =
$extension) =~ s/$ARGV/g; } rename($ARGV, $backup);
open(ARGVOUT, &quot;&gt;$ARGV&quot;); select(ARGVOUT);
$oldargv = $ARGV; } s/foo/bar/; } continue { print; # this
prints to original filename } select(STDOUT);</p>

<p>except that the -i form doesnt need to compare $ARGV to
$oldargv to know when the filename has changed. It does,
however, use ARGVOUT for the selected filehandle. Note that
STDOUT is restored as the default output filehandle after
the loop.</p>

<p>As shown above, Perl creates the backup file whether or
not any output is actually changed. So this is just a fancy
way to copy files:</p>

<p>$ perl -p -i&rsquo;/some/file/path/*&rsquo; -e 1 file1
file2 file3... or $ perl -p -i&rsquo;.orig&rsquo; -e 1 file1
file2 file3...</p>

<p>You can use &quot;eof&quot; without parentheses to
locate the end of each input file, in case you want to
append to each file, or reset line numbering (see example in
&quot;eof&quot; in perlfunc).</p>

<p>If, for a given file, Perl is unable to create the
backup file as specified in the extension then it will skip
that file and continue on with the next one (if it
exists).</p>

<p>For a discussion of issues surrounding file permissions
and -i, see &quot;Why does Perl let me delete read-only
files? Why does -i clobber protected files? Isnt this a bug
in Perl?&quot; in perlfaq5.</p>

<p>You cannot use -i to create directories or to strip
extensions from files.</p>

<p>Perl does not expand &quot;~&quot; in filenames, which
is good, since some folks use it for their backup files:</p>

<p>$ perl -pi~ -e &rsquo;s/foo/bar/&rsquo; file1 file2
file3...</p>

<p>Note that because -i renames or deletes the original
file before creating a new file of the same name, UNIX-style
soft and hard links will not be preserved.</p>

<p>Finally, the -i switch does not impede execution when no
files are given on the command line. In this case, no backup
is made (the original file cannot, of course, be determined)
and processing proceeds from STDIN to STDOUT as might be
expected.</p>

<p>-Idirectory Directories specified by -I are prepended to
the search path for modules (@INC), and also tells the C
preprocessor where to search for include files. The C
preprocessor is invoked with -P; by default it searches
/usr/include and /usr/lib/perl.</p>

<p>-l[octnum] enables automatic line-ending processing. It
has two separate effects. First, it automatically chomps $/
(the input record separator) when used with -n or -p.
Second, it assigns &quot;$ output record separator) to have
the value of octnum so that any print statements will have
that separator added back on. If octnum is omitted, sets
&quot;$ instance, to trim lines to 80 columns:</p>

<p>perl -lpe &rsquo;substr($_, 80) =
&quot;&quot;&rsquo;</p>

<p>Note that the assignment &quot;$ = $/&quot; is done when
the switch is processed, so the input record separator can
be different than the output record separator if the -l
switch is followed by a -0 switch:</p>

<p>gnufind / -print0 | perl -ln0e &rsquo;print &quot;found
$_&quot; if -p&rsquo;</p>

<p>This sets &quot;$</p>

<p>-m[-]module -M[-]module -M[-]module ..._
-[mM][-]module=arg[,arg]... -mmodule executes
&quot;use&quot; module &quot;();&quot; before executing your
program.</p>

<p>-Mmodule executes &quot;use&quot; module &quot;;&quot;
before executing your program. You can use quotes to add
extra code after the module name, e.g., &rsquo;-Mmodule
qw(foo bar)&rsquo;.</p>

<p>If the first character after the -M or -m is a dash
(&quot;-&quot;) then the use is replaced with no.</p>

<p>A little builtin syntactic sugar means you can also say
-mmodule=foo,bar or -Mmodule=foo,bar as a shortcut for
&rsquo;-Mmodule qw(foo bar)&rsquo;. This avoids the need to
use quotes when importing symbols. The actual code generated
by -Mmodule=foo,bar is &quot;use module
split(/,/,q{foo,bar})&quot;. Note that the &quot;=&quot;
form removes the distinction between -m and -M.</p>

<p>A consequence of this is that -MFoo=number never does a
version check (unless &quot;Foo::import()&quot; itself is
set up to do a version check, which could happen for example
if Foo inherits from Exporter.)</p>

<p>-n causes Perl to assume the following loop around your
program, which makes it iterate over filename arguments
somewhat like sed -n or awk:</p>

<p>LINE: while (&lt;&gt;) { ... # your program goes here
}</p>

<p>Note that the lines are not printed by default. See -p
to have lines printed. If a file named by an argument cannot
be opened for some reason, Perl warns you about it and moves
on to the next file.</p>

<p>Also note that &quot;&lt;&gt;&quot; passes command line
arguments to &quot;open&quot; in perlfunc, which doesnt
necessarily interpret them as file names. See perlop for
possible security implications.</p>

<p>Here is an efficient way to delete all files that havent
been modified for at least a week:</p>

<p>find . -mtime +7 -print | perl -nle unlink</p>

<p>This is faster than using the -exec switch of find
because you dont have to start a process on every filename
found. It does suffer from the bug of mishandling newlines
in pathnames, which you can fix if you follow the example
under -0.</p>

<p>&quot;BEGIN&quot; and &quot;END&quot; blocks may be used
to capture control before or after the implicit program
loop, just as in awk.</p>

<p>-p causes Perl to assume the following loop around your
program, which makes it iterate over filename arguments
somewhat like sed:</p>

<p>LINE: while (&lt;&gt;) { ... # your program goes here }
continue { print or die &quot;-p destination: $!0; }</p>

<p>If a file named by an argument cannot be opened for some
reason, Perl warns you about it, and moves on to the next
file. Note that the lines are printed automatically. An
error occurring during printing is treated as fatal. To
suppress printing use the -n switch. A -p overrides a -n
switch.</p>

<p>&quot;BEGIN&quot; and &quot;END&quot; blocks may be used
to capture control before or after the implicit loop, just
as in awk.</p>

<p>-P NOTE: Use of -P is strongly discouraged because of
its inherent problems, including poor portability. It is
deprecated and will be removed in a future version of
Perl.</p>

<p>This option causes your program to be run through the C
preprocessor before compilation by Perl. Because both
comments and cpp directives begin with the # character, you
should avoid starting comments with any words recognized by
the C preprocessor such as &quot;if&quot;, &quot;else&quot;,
or &quot;define&quot;.</p>

<p>If youre considering using &quot;-P&quot;, you might
also want to look at the Filter::cpp module from CPAN.</p>

<p>The problems of -P include, but are not limited to:</p>

<p>&middot; The &quot;#!&quot; line is stripped, so any
switches there dont apply.</p>

<p>&middot; A &quot;-P&quot; on a &quot;#!&quot; line
doesnt work.</p>

<p>&middot; All lines that begin with (whitespace and) a
&quot;#&quot; but do not look like cpp commands, are
stripped, including anything inside Perl strings, regular
expressions, and here-docs .</p>

<p>&middot; In some platforms the C preprocessor knows too
much: it knows about the C++ -style until-end-of-line
comments starting with &quot;//&quot;. This will cause
problems with common Perl constructs like</p>

<p>s/foo//;</p>

<p>because after -P this will became illegal code</p>

<p>s/foo</p>

<p>The workaround is to use some other quoting separator
than &quot;/&quot;, like for example &quot;!&quot;:</p>

<p>s!foo!!;</p>

<p>&middot; It requires not only a working C preprocessor
but also a working sed. If not on UNIX, you are probably out
of luck on this.</p>

<p>&middot; Script line numbers are not preserved.</p>

<p>&middot; The &quot;-x&quot; does not work with
&quot;-P&quot;.</p>

<p>-s enables rudimentary switch parsing for switches on
the command line after the program name but before any
filename arguments (or before an argument of --). Any switch
found there is removed from @ARGV and sets the corresponding
variable in the Perl program. The following program prints
&quot;1&quot; if the program is invoked with a -xyz switch,
and &quot;abc&quot; if it is invoked with -xyz=abc.</p>

<p>#!/usr/bin/perl -s if ($xyz) { print &quot;$xyz0 }</p>

<p>Do note that a switch like --help creates the variable
${-help}, which is not compliant with &quot;strict
refs&quot;. Also, when using this option on a script with
warnings enabled you may get a lot of spurious &quot;used
only once&quot; warnings.</p>

<p>-S makes Perl use the PATH environment variable to
search for the program (unless the name of the program
contains directory separators).</p>

<p>On some platforms, this also makes Perl append suffixes
to the filename while searching for it. For example, on
Win32 platforms, the &quot;.bat&quot; and &quot;.cmd&quot;
suffixes are appended if a lookup for the original name
fails, and if the name does not already end in one of those
suffixes. If your Perl was compiled with DEBUGGING turned
on, using the -Dp switch to Perl shows how the search
progresses.</p>

<p>Typically this is used to emulate #! startup on
platforms that dont support #!. Its also convenient when
debugging a script that uses #!, and is thus normally found
by the shell s $PATH search mechanism.</p>

<p>This example works on many platforms that have a shell
compatible with Bourne shell:</p>

<p>#!/usr/bin/perl eval &rsquo;exec /usr/bin/perl -wS $0
${1+&quot;$@&quot;}&rsquo; if $running_under_some_shell;</p>

<p>The system ignores the first line and feeds the program
to /bin/sh, which proceeds to try to execute the Perl
program as a shell script. The shell executes the second
line as a normal shell command, and thus starts up the Perl
interpreter. On some systems $0 doesnt always contain the
full pathname, so the -S tells Perl to search for the
program if necessary. After Perl locates the program, it
parses the lines and ignores them because the variable
$running_under_some_shell is never true. If the program will
be interpreted by csh, you will need to replace
&quot;${1+&quot;$@&quot;}&quot; with $*, even though that
doesn t understand embedded spaces (and such) in the
argument list. To start up sh rather than csh, some systems
may have to replace the #! line with a line containing just
a colon, which will be politely ignored by Perl. Other
systems cant control that, and need a totally devious
construct that will work under any of csh, sh, or Perl, such
as the following:</p>

<p>eval &rsquo;(exit $?0)&rsquo; &amp;&amp; eval
&rsquo;exec perl -wS $0 ${1+&quot;$@&quot;}&rsquo; &amp;
eval &rsquo;exec /usr/bin/perl -wS $0 $argv:q&rsquo; if
$running_under_some_shell;</p>

<p>If the filename supplied contains directory separators
(i.e., is an absolute or relative pathname), and if that
file is not found, platforms that append file extensions
will do so and try to look for the file with those
extensions added, one by one.</p>

<p>On DOS-like platforms, if the program does not contain
directory separators, it will first be searched for in the
current directory before being searched for on the PATH. On
Unix platforms, the program will be searched for strictly on
the PATH.</p>

<p>-t Like -T, but taint checks will issue warnings rather
than fatal errors. These warnings can be controlled normally
with &quot;no warnings qw(taint)&quot;.</p>

<p>NOTE: this is not a substitute for -T. This is meant
only to be used as a temporary development aid while
securing legacy code: for real production code and for new
secure code written from scratch always use the real -T.</p>

<p>-T forces &quot;taint&quot; checks to be turned on so
you can test them. Ordinarily these checks are done only
when running setuid or setgid. It s a good idea to turn them
on explicitly for programs that run on behalf of someone
else whom you might not necessarily trust, such as CGI
programs or any internet servers you might write in Perl.
See perlsec for details. For security reasons, this option
must be seen by Perl quite early; usually this means it must
appear early on the command line or in the #! line for
systems which support that construct.</p>

<p>-u This obsolete switch causes Perl to dump core after
compiling your program. You can then in theory take this
core dump and turn it into an executable file by using the
undump program (not supplied). This speeds startup at the
expense of some disk space (which you can minimize by
stripping the executable). (Still, a &quot;hello world&quot;
executable comes out to about 200K on my machine.) If you
want to execute a portion of your program before dumping,
use the dump() operator instead. Note: availability of
undump is platform specific and may not be available for a
specific port of Perl.</p>

<p>-U allows Perl to do unsafe operations. Currently the
only &quot;unsafe&quot; operations are attempting to unlink
directories while running as superuser, and running setuid
programs with fatal taint checks turned into warnings. Note
that the -w switch (or the $^W variable) must be used along
with this option to actually generate the taint-check
warnings.</p>

<p>-v prints the version and patchlevel of your perl
executable.</p>

<p>-V prints summary of the major perl configuration values
and the current values of @INC.</p>

<p>-V:configvar Prints to STDOUT the value of the named
configuration variable(s), with multiples when your
configvar argument looks like a regex (has non-letters). For
example:</p>

<p>$ perl -V:libc libc=&rsquo;/lib/libc-2.2.4.so&rsquo;; $
perl -V:lib. libs=&rsquo;-lnsl -lgdbm -ldb -ldl -lm -lcrypt
-lutil -lc&rsquo;; libc=&rsquo;/lib/libc-2.2.4.so&rsquo;; $
perl -V:lib.* libpth=&rsquo;/usr/local/lib /lib
/usr/lib&rsquo;; libs=&rsquo;-lnsl -lgdbm -ldb -ldl -lm
-lcrypt -lutil -lc&rsquo;; lib_ext=&rsquo;.a&rsquo;;
libc=&rsquo;/lib/libc-2.2.4.so&rsquo;;
libperl=&rsquo;libperl.a&rsquo;; ....</p>

<p>Additionally, extra colons can be used to control
formatting. A trailing colon suppresses the linefeed and
terminator ;, allowing you to embed queries into shell
commands. (mnemonic: PATH separator :.)</p>

<p>$ echo &quot;compression-vars: &quot; &lsquo;perl
-V:z.*: &lsquo; &quot; are here !&quot; compression-vars:
zcat=&rsquo;&rsquo; zip=&rsquo;zip&rsquo; are here !</p>

<p>A leading colon removes the name= part of the response,
this allows you to map to the name you need. (mnemonic:
empty label)</p>

<p>$ echo &quot;goodvfork=&quot;&lsquo;./perl -Ilib
-V::usevfork&lsquo; goodvfork=false;</p>

<p>Leading and trailing colons can be used together if you
need positional parameter values without the names. Note
that in the case below, the PERL_API params are returned in
alphabetical order.</p>

<p>$ echo building_on &lsquo;perl -V::osname:
-V::PERL_API_.*:&lsquo; now building_on &rsquo;linux&rsquo;
&rsquo;5&rsquo; &rsquo;1&rsquo; &rsquo;9&rsquo; now</p>

<p>-w prints warnings about dubious constructs, such as
variable names that are mentioned only once and scalar
variables that are used before being set, redefined
subroutines, references to undefined filehandles or
filehandles opened read-only that you are attempting to
write on, values used as a number that dont look like
numbers, using an array as though it were a scalar, if your
subroutines recurse more than 100 deep, and innumerable
other things.</p>

<p>This switch really just enables the internal $^W
variable. You can disable or promote into fatal errors
specific warnings using &quot;__WARN__&quot; hooks, as
described in perlvar and &quot;warn&quot; in perlfunc. See
also perldiag and perltrap. A new, fine-grained warning
facility is also available if you want to manipulate entire
classes of warnings; see warnings or perllexwarn.</p>

<p>-W Enables all warnings regardless of &quot;no
warnings&quot; or $^W. See perllexwarn.</p>

<p>-X Disables all warnings regardless of &quot;use
warnings&quot; or $^W. See perllexwarn.</p>

<p>-x -xdirectory tells Perl that the program is embedded
in a larger chunk of unrelated ASCII text, such as in a mail
message. Leading garbage will be discarded until the first
line that starts with #! and contains the string
&quot;perl&quot;. Any meaningful switches on that line will
be applied.</p>

<p>All references to line numbers by the program (warnings,
errors, ...) will treat the #! line as the first line. Thus
a warning on the 2nd line of the program (which is on the
100th line in the file) will be reported as line 2, and not
as line 100. This can be overridden by using the #line
directive. (See &quot;Plain-Old-Comments-(Not!)&quot; in
perlsyn)</p>

<p>If a directory name is specified, Perl will switch to
that directory before running the program. The -x switch
controls only the disposal of leading garbage. The program
must be terminated with &quot;__END__&quot; if there is
trailing garbage to be ignored (the program can process any
or all of the trailing garbage via the DATA filehandle if
desired).</p>

<p>The directory, if specified, must appear immediately
following the -x with no intervening whitespace.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT HOME Used if chdir has no argument.</p>

<p>LOGDIR Used if chdir has no argument and HOME is not
set.</p>

<p>PATH Used in executing subprocesses, and in finding the
program if -S is used.</p>

<p>PERL5LIB A list of directories in which to look for Perl
library files before looking in the standard library and the
current directory. Any architecture-specific directories
under the specified locations are automatically included if
they exist (this lookup being done at interpreter startup
time.)</p>

<p>If PERL5LIB is not defined, PERLLIB is used. Directories
are separated (like in PATH) by a colon on unixish platforms
and by a semicolon on Windows (the proper path separator
being given by the command &quot;perl
-V:path_sep&quot;).</p>

<p>When running taint checks (either because the program
was running setuid or setgid, or the -T or -t switch was
specified), neither variable is used. The program should
instead say:</p>

<p>use lib &quot;/my/directory&quot;;</p>

<p>PERL5OPT Command-line options (switches). Switches in
this variable are taken as if they were on every Perl
command line. Only the -[CDIMUdmtw] switches are allowed.
When running taint checks (because the program was running
setuid or setgid, or the -T switch was used), this variable
is ignored. If PERL5OPT begins with -T, tainting will be
enabled, and any subsequent options ignored.</p>

<p>PERLIO A space (or colon) separated list of PerlIO
layers. If perl is built to use PerlIO system for IO (the
default) these layers effect perls IO.</p>

<p>It is conventional to start layer names with a colon
e.g. &quot;:perlio&quot; to emphasise their similarity to
variable &quot;attributes&quot;. But the code that parses
layer specification strings (which is also used to decode
the PERLIO environment variable) treats the colon as a
separator.</p>

<p>An unset or empty PERLIO is equivalent to the default
set of layers for your platform, for example
&quot;:unix:perlio&quot; on UNIX-like systems and
&quot;:unix:crlf&quot; on Windows and other DOS-like
systems.</p>

<p>The list becomes the default for all perls IO.
Consequently only built-in layers can appear in this list,
as external layers (such as :encoding()) need IO in order to
load them!. See &quot;open pragma&quot; for how to add
external encodings as defaults.</p>

<p>The layers that it makes sense to include in the PERLIO
environment variable are briefly summarised below. For more
details see PerlIO.</p>

<p>:bytes A pseudolayer that turns off the
&quot;:utf8&quot; flag for the layer below. Unlikely to be
useful on its own in the global PERLIO environment variable.
You perhaps were thinking of &quot;:crlf:bytes&quot; or
&quot;:perlio:bytes&quot;.</p>

<p>:crlf A layer which does CRLF to &quot;0 translation
distinguishing &quot;text&quot; and &quot;binary&quot; files
in the manner of MS-DOS and similar operating systems. (It
currently does not mimic MS-DOS as far as treating of
Control-Z as being an end-of-file marker.)</p>

<p>:mmap A layer which implements &quot;reading&quot; of
files by using &quot;mmap()&quot; to make (whole) file
appear in the processs address space, and then using that as
PerlIOs &quot;buffer&quot;.</p>

<p>:perlio This is a re-implementation of
&quot;stdio-like&quot; buffering written as a PerlIO
&quot;layer&quot;. As such it will call whatever layer is
below it for its operations (typically
&quot;:unix&quot;).</p>

<p>:pop An experimental pseudolayer that removes the
topmost layer. Use with the same care as is reserved for
nitroglycerin.</p>

<p>:raw A pseudolayer that manipulates other layers.
Applying the &quot;:raw&quot; layer is equivalent to calling
&quot;binmode($fh)&quot;. It makes the stream pass each byte
as-is without any translation. In particular CRLF
translation, and/or :utf8 intuited from locale are
disabled.</p>

<p>Unlike in the earlier versions of Perl &quot;:raw&quot;
is not just the inverse of &quot;:crlf&quot; - other layers
which would affect the binary nature of the stream are also
removed or disabled.</p>

<p>:stdio This layer provides PerlIO interface by wrapping
systems ANSI C &quot;stdio&quot; library calls. The layer
provides both buffering and IO. Note that &quot;:stdio&quot;
layer does not do CRLF translation even if that is platforms
normal behaviour. You will need a &quot;:crlf&quot; layer
above it to do that.</p>

<p>:unix Low level layer which calls &quot;read&quot;,
&quot;write&quot; and &quot;lseek&quot; etc.</p>

<p>:utf8 A pseudolayer that turns on a flag on the layer
below to tell perl that output should be in utf8 and that
input should be regarded as already in valid utf8 form. It
does not check for validity and as such should be handled
with caution for input. Generally
&quot;:encoding(utf8)&quot; is the best option when reading
UTF-8 encoded data.</p>

<p>:win32 On Win32 platforms this experimental layer uses
native &quot;handle&quot; IO rather than unix-like numeric
file descriptor layer. Known to be buggy in this
release.</p>

<p>On all platforms the default set of layers should give
acceptable results.</p>

<p>For UNIX platforms that will equivalent of &quot;unix
perlio&quot; or &quot;stdio&quot;. Configure is setup to
prefer &quot;stdio&quot; implementation if systems library
provides for fast access to the buffer, otherwise it uses
the &quot;unix perlio&quot; implementation.</p>

<p>On Win32 the default in this release is &quot;unix
crlf&quot;. Win32 s &quot;stdio&quot; has a number of
bugs/mis-features for perl IO which are somewhat C compiler
vendor/version dependent. Using our own &quot;crlf&quot;
layer as the buffer avoids those issues and makes things
more uniform. The &quot;crlf&quot; layer provides CRLF
to/from &quot;0 conversion as well as buffering.</p>

<p>This release uses &quot;unix&quot; as the bottom layer
on Win32 and so still uses C compiler s numeric file
descriptor routines. There is an experimental native
&quot;win32&quot; layer which is expected to be enhanced and
should eventually be the default under Win32.</p>

<p>The PERLIO environment variable is completely ignored
when perl is run in taint mode.</p>

<p>PERLIO_DEBUG If set to the name of a file or device then
certain operations of PerlIO sub-system will be logged to
that file (opened as append). Typical uses are UNIX:</p>

<p>PERLIO_DEBUG=/dev/tty perl script ...</p>

<p>and Win32 approximate equivalent:</p>

<p>set PERLIO_DEBUG=CON perl script ...</p>

<p>This functionality is disabled for setuid scripts and
for scripts run with -T.</p>

<p>PERLLIB A list of directories in which to look for Perl
library files before looking in the standard library and the
current directory. If PERL5LIB is defined, PERLLIB is not
used.</p>

<p>The PERLLIB environment variable is completely ignored
when perl is run in taint mode.</p>

<p>PERL5DB The command used to load the debugger code. The
default is:</p>

<p>BEGIN { require &rsquo;perl5db.pl&rsquo; }</p>

<p>The PERL5DB environment variable only used when perl is
started with a bare -d switch.</p>

<p>PERL5DB_THREADED If set to a true value, indicates to
the debugger that the code being debugged uses threads.</p>

<p>PERL5SHELL (specific to the Win32 port) May be set to an
alternative shell that perl must use internally for
executing &quot;backtick&quot; commands or system(). Default
is &quot;cmd.exe /x/d/c&quot; on WindowsNT and
&quot;command.com /c&quot; on Windows95. The value is
considered to be space- separated. Precede any character
that needs to be protected (like a space or backslash) with
a backslash.</p>

<p>Note that Perl doesnt use COMSPEC for this purpose
because COMSPEC has a high degree of variability among
users, leading to portability concerns. Besides, perl can
use a shell that may not be fit for interactive use, and
setting COMSPEC to such a shell may interfere with the
proper functioning of other programs (which usually look in
COMSPEC to find a shell fit for interactive use).</p>

<p>Before Perl 5.10.0 and 5.8.8, PERL5SHELL was not taint
checked when running external commands. It is recommended
that you explicitly set (or delete) $ENV{PERL5SHELL} when
running in taint mode under Windows.</p>

<p>PERL_ALLOW_NON_IFS_LSP (specific to the Win32 port) Set
to 1 to allow the use of non-IFS compatible LSPs. Perl
normally searches for an IFS-compatible LSP because this is
required for its emulation of Windows sockets as real
filehandles. However, this may cause problems if you have a
firewall such as McAfee Guardian which requires all
applications to use its LSP which is not IFS-compatible,
because clearly Perl will normally avoid using such an LSP.
Setting this environment variable to 1 means that Perl will
simply use the first suitable LSP enumerated in the catalog,
which keeps McAfee Guardian happy (and in that particular
case Perl still works too because McAfee Guardian s LSP
actually plays some other games which allow applications
requiring IFS compatibility to work).</p>

<p>PERL_DEBUG_MSTATS Relevant only if perl is compiled with
the malloc included with the perl distribution (that is, if
&quot;perl -V:d_mymalloc&quot; is define ). If set, this
causes memory statistics to be dumped after execution. If
set to an integer greater than one, also causes memory
statistics to be dumped after compilation.</p>

<p>PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL Relevant only if your perl
executable was built with -DDEBUGGING, this controls the
behavior of global destruction of objects and other
references. See &quot;PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL&quot; in perlhack
for more information.</p>

<p>PERL_DL_NONLAZY Set to one to have perl resolve all
undefined symbols when it loads a dynamic library. The
default behaviour is to resolve symbols when they are used.
Setting this variable is useful during testing of extensions
as it ensures that you get an error on misspelled function
names even if the test suite doesnt call it.</p>

<p>PERL_ENCODING If using the &quot;encoding&quot; pragma
without an explicit encoding name, the PERL_ENCODING
environment variable is consulted for an encoding name.</p>

<p>PERL_HASH_SEED (Since Perl 5.8.1.) Used to randomise
perl s internal hash function. To emulate the pre-5.8.1
behaviour, set to an integer (zero means exactly the same
order as 5.8.0). &quot;Pre-5.8.1&quot; means, among other
things, that hash keys will always have the same ordering
between different runs of perl.</p>

<p>Most hashes return elements in the same order as Perl
5.8.0 by default. On a hash by hash basis, if pathological
data is detected during a hash key insertion, then that hash
will switch to an alternative random hash seed.</p>

<p>The default behaviour is to randomise unless the
PERL_HASH_SEED is set. If perl has been compiled with
&quot;-DUSE_HASH_SEED_EXPLICIT&quot;, the default behaviour
is not to randomise unless the PERL_HASH_SEED is set.</p>

<p>If PERL_HASH_SEED is unset or set to a non-numeric
string, perl uses the pseudorandom seed supplied by the
operating system and libraries.</p>

<p>Please note that the hash seed is sensitive information.
Hashes are randomized to protect against local and remote
attacks against Perl code. By manually setting a seed this
protection may be partially or completely lost.</p>

<p>See &quot;Algorithmic Complexity Attacks&quot; in
perlsec and &quot;PERL_HASH_SEED_DEBUG&quot; for more
information.</p>

<p>PERL_HASH_SEED_DEBUG (Since Perl 5.8.1.) Set to one to
display (to STDERR) the value of the hash seed at the
beginning of execution. This, combined with
&quot;PERL_HASH_SEED&quot; is intended to aid in debugging
nondeterministic behavior caused by hash randomization.</p>

<p>Note that the hash seed is sensitive information: by
knowing it one can craft a denial-of-service attack against
Perl code, even remotely, see &quot;Algorithmic Complexity
Attacks&quot; in perlsec for more information. Do not
disclose the hash seed to people who dont need to know it.
See also hash_seed() of Hash::Util.</p>

<p>PERL_ROOT (specific to the VMS port) A translation
concealed rooted logical name that contains perl and the
logical device for the @INC path on VMS only. Other logical
names that affect perl on VMS include PERLSHR,
PERL_ENV_TABLES, and SYS$TIMEZONE_DIFFERENTIAL but are
optional and discussed further in perlvms and in README.vms
in the Perl source distribution.</p>

<p>PERL_SIGNALS In Perls 5.8.1 and later. If set to
&quot;unsafe&quot; the pre-Perl-5.8.0 signals behaviour
(immediate but unsafe) is restored. If set to
&quot;safe&quot; the safe (or deferred) signals are used.
See &quot;Deferred Signals (Safe Signals)&quot; in
perlipc.</p>

<p>PERL_UNICODE Equivalent to the -C command-line switch.
Note that this is not a boolean variable-- setting this to
&quot;1&quot; is not the right way to &quot;enable
Unicode&quot; (whatever that would mean). You can use
&quot;0&quot; to &quot;disable Unicode&quot;, though (or
alternatively unset PERL_UNICODE in your shell before
starting Perl). See the description of the &quot;-C&quot;
switch for more information.</p>

<p>SYS$LOGIN (specific to the VMS port) Used if chdir has
no argument and HOME and LOGDIR are not set.</p>

<p>Perl also has environment variables that control how
Perl handles data specific to particular natural languages.
See perllocale.</p>

<p>Apart from these, Perl uses no other environment
variables, except to make them available to the program
being executed, and to child processes. However, programs
running setuid would do well to execute the following lines
before doing anything else, just to keep people honest:</p>

<p>$ENV{PATH} = &rsquo;/bin:/usr/bin&rsquo;; # or whatever
you need $ENV{SHELL} = &rsquo;/bin/sh&rsquo; if exists
$ENV{SHELL}; delete @ENV{qw(IFS CDPATH ENV BASH_ENV)};</p>
