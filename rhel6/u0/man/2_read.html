<p>NAME read - read from a file descriptor</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>ssize_t read(int fd, void *buf, size_t count);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION read() attempts to read up to count bytes
from file descriptor fd into the buffer starting at buf.</p>

<p>If count is zero, read() returns zero and has no other
results. If count is greater than SSIZE_MAX, the result is
unspecified.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, the number of bytes read is
returned (zero indicates end of file), and the file position
is advanced by this number. It is not an error if this
number is smaller than the number of bytes requested; this
may happen for example because fewer bytes are actually
available right now (maybe because we were close to
end-of-file, or because we are reading from a pipe, or from
a terminal), or because read() was interrupted by a signal.
On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set appropriately. In
this case it is left unspecified whether the file position
(if any) changes.</p>

<p>ERRORS EAGAIN The file descriptor fd refers to a file
other than a socket and has been marked non-blocking
(O_NONBLOCK), and the read would block.</p>

<p>EAGAIN or EWOULDBLOCK The file descriptor fd refers to a
socket and has been marked non-blocking (O_NONBLOCK), and
the read would block. POSIX.1-2001 allows either error to be
returned for this case, and does not require these constants
to have the same value, so a portable application should
check for both possibilities.</p>

<p>EBADF fd is not a valid file descriptor or is not open
for reading.</p>

<p>EFAULT buf is outside your accessible address space.</p>

<p>EINTR The call was interrupted by a signal before any
data was read; see signal(7).</p>

<p>EINVAL fd is attached to an object which is unsuitable
for reading; or the file was opened with the O_DIRECT flag,
and either the address specified in buf, the value specified
in count, or the current file offset is not suitably
aligned.</p>

<p>EINVAL fd was created via a call to timerfd_create(2)
and the wrong size buffer was given to read(); see
timerfd_create(2) for fur- ther information.</p>

<p>EIO I/O error. This will happen for example when the
process is in a background process group, tries to read from
its controlling tty, and either it is ignoring or blocking
SIGTTIN or its pro- cess group is orphaned. It may also
occur when there is a low- level I/O error while reading
from a disk or tape.</p>

<p>EISDIR fd refers to a directory.</p>

<p>Other errors may occur, depending on the object
connected to fd. POSIX allows a read() that is interrupted
after reading some data to return -1 (with errno set to
EINTR) or to return the number of bytes already read.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO SVr4, 4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>NOTES On NFS file systems, reading small amounts of data
will only update the timestamp the first time, subsequent
calls may not do so. This is caused by client side attribute
caching, because most if not all NFS clients leave st_atime
(last file access time) updates to the server and client
side reads satisfied from the clients cache will not cause
st_atime updates on the server as there are no server side
reads. Unix semantics can be obtained by disabling client
side attribute caching, but in most situations this will
substantially increase server load and decrease
performance.</p>

<p>Many file systems and disks were considered to be fast
enough that the implementation of O_NONBLOCK was deemed
unnecessary. So, O_NONBLOCK may not be available on files
and/or disks.</p>
