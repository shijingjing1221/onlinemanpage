<p>DOVEADM-FORCE-RESYNC(1) Dovecot
DOVEADM-FORCE-RESYNC(1)</p>

<p>NAME doveadm-force-resync - Repair broken mailboxes</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS doveadm [-Dv] force-resync mailbox doveadm
[-Dv] force-resync -A mailbox doveadm [-Dv] force-resync -u
user mailbox</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Under certain circumstances it may happen,
that dovecot(1) is unable to automatically solve problems
with mailboxes. In such situations the force-resync command
may be helpful. It tries to fix all problems. For dbox and
mdbox mailboxes the storage files will be also checked.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Global doveadm(1) options:</p>

<p>-D Enables verbosity and debug messages.</p>

<p>-v Enables verbosity, including progress counter.</p>

<p>Command specific options:</p>

<p>-A If the -A option is present, the command will be
performed for all users. Using this option in combination
with system users from userdb { driver = passwd } is not
recommended, because it contains also users with a lower UID
than the one configured with the first_valid_uid
setting.</p>

<p>When the sql userdb module is used make sure that the
iter- ate_query setting in the
/etc/dovecot/dovecot-sql.conf.ext matches your database
layout. Otherwise doveadm(1) will be unable to iterate over
all users.</p>

<p>-u user/mask Run the command only for the given user.
It&rsquo;s also possible to use &rsquo;*&rsquo; and
&rsquo;?&rsquo; wildcards (e.g. -u *@example.org). When
neither the -A option nor -u user was specified, the com-
mand will be executed with the environment of the currently
logged in user.</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS mailbox The name of the mailbox to fix. With
mdbox all of the mailboxes are fixed, so you can use for
example INBOX as the name.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE Fix bob&rsquo;s INBOX:</p>

<p>doveadm force-resync -u bob INBOX</p>
