<p>SSSD-IPA(5) File Formats and Conventions SSSD-IPA(5)</p>

<p>NAME sssd-ipa - the configuration file for SSSD</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page describes the configuration
of the IPA provider for sssd(8). For a detailed syntax
reference, refer to the FILE FORMAT section of the
sssd.conf(5) manual page.</p>

<p>The IPA provider is a back end used to connect to an IPA
server. (Refer to the freeipa.org web site for information
about IPA servers.) This provider requires that the machine
be joined to the IPA domain; configuration is almost
entirely self-discovered and obtained directly from the
server.</p>

<p>The IPA provider accepts the same options used by the
sssd-ldap(5) identity provider and the sssd-krb5(5)
authentication provider. However, it is neither necessary
nor recommended to set these options.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION OPTIONS Refer to the section DOMAIN
SECTIONS of the sssd.conf(5) manual page for details on the
configuration of an SSSD domain.</p>

<p>ipa_domain (string) Specifies the name of the IPA
domain. This is optional. If not provided, the configuration
domain name is used.</p>

<p>ipa_server (string) The list of IP addresses or
hostnames of the IPA servers to which SSSD should connect in
the order of preference. For more information on failover
and server redundancy, see the FAILOVER section. This is
optional if autodiscovery is enabled. For more information
on service discovery, refer to the the SERVICE DISCOVERY
section.</p>

<p>ipa_hostname (string) Optional. May be set on machines
where the hostname(5) does not reflect the fully qualified
name used in the IPA domain to identify this host.</p>

<p>ipa_dyndns_update (boolean) Optional. This option tells
SSSD to automatically update the DNS server built into
FreeIPA v2 with the IP address of this client.</p>

<p>Default: false</p>

<p>ipa_dyndns_iface (string) Optional. Applicable only when
ipa_dyndns_update is true. Choose the interface whose IP
address should be used for dynamic DNS updates.</p>

<p>Default: Use the IP address of the IPA LDAP
connection</p>

<p>krb5_validate (boolean) Verify with the help of
krb5_keytab that the TGT obtained has not been spoofed.</p>

<p>Default: true</p>

<p>Note that this default differs from the traditional
Kerberos provider back end.</p>

<p>FAILOVER The failover feature allows back ends to
automatically switch to a different server if the primary
server fails.</p>

<p>Failover Syntax The list of servers is given as a
comma-separated list; any number of spaces is allowed around
the comma. The servers are listed in order of preference.
The list can contain any number of servers.</p>

<p>The Failover Mechanism The failover mechanism
distinguishes between a machine and a service. The back end
first tries to resolve the hostname of a given machine; if
this resolution attempt fails, the machine is considered
offline. No further attempts are made to connect to this
machine for any other service. If the resolution attempt
succeeds, the back end tries to connect to a service on this
machine. If the service connection attempt fails, then only
this particular service is considered offline and the back
end automatically switches over to the next service. The
machine is still considered online and might still be tried
for another service.</p>

<p>Further connection attempts are made to machines or
services marked as offline after a specified period of time;
this is currently hard coded to 30 seconds.</p>

<p>If there are no more machines to try, the back end as a
whole switches to offline mode, and then attempts to
reconnect every 30 seconds.</p>

<p>SERVICE DISCOVERY The service discovery feature allows
back ends to automatically find the appropriate servers to
connect to using a special DNS query.</p>

<p>Configuration If no servers are specified, the back end
automatically uses service discovery to try to find a
server. Optionally, the user may choose to use both fixed
server addresses and service discovery by inserting a
special keyword, _srv_, in the list of servers. The order of
preference is maintained. This feature is useful if, for
example, the user prefers to use service discovery whenever
possible, and fall back to a specific server when no servers
can be discovered using DNS.</p>

<p>The domain name The name of the SSSD domain is used as
the domain part of the service discovery DNS query.</p>

<p>See Also For more information on the service discovery
mechanism, refer to RFC 2782.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE The following example assumes that SSSD is
correctly configured and example.com is one of the domains
in the [sssd] section. This examples shows only the ipa
provider-specific options.</p>

<p>[domain/example.com] id_provider = ipa ipa_server =
ipaserver.example.com ipa_hostname = myhost.example.com</p>
