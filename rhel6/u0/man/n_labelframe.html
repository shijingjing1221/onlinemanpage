<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME labelframe - Create and manipulate labelframe
widgets</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS labelframe pathName ?options?</p>

<p>STANDARD OPTIONS -borderwidth -highlightbackground -pady
-cursor -highlightcolor -relief -font -highlightthickness
-takefocus -foreground -padx -text</p>

<p>See the options manual entry for details on the standard
options.</p>

<p>WIDGET-SPECIFIC OPTIONS Command-Line Name:-background
Database Name: background Database Class: Background</p>

<p>This option is the same as the standard background
option except that its value may also be specified as an
empty string. In this case, the widget will display no
background or border, and no colors will be consumed from
its colormap for its background and border.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-class Database Name: class Database
Class: Class</p>

<p>Specifies a class for the window. This class will be
used when querying the option database for the windows other
options, and it will also be used later for other purposes
such as bindings. The class option may not be changed with
the configure widget command.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-colormap Database Name: colormap
Database Class: Colormap</p>

<p>Specifies a colormap to use for the window. The value
may be either new, in which case a new colormap is created
for the win- dow and its children, or the name of another
window (which must be on the same screen and have the same
visual as pathName), in which case the new window will use
the colormap from the speci- fied window. If the colormap
option is not specified, the new window uses the same
colormap as its parent. This option may not be changed with
the configure widget command.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-container Database Name: container
Database Class: Container</p>

<p>The value must be a boolean. If true, it means that this
window will be used as a container in which some other
application will be embedded (for example, a Tk toplevel can
be embedded using the -use option). The window will support
the appropriate win- dow manager protocols for things like
geometry requests. The window should not have any children
of its own in this applica- tion. This option may not be
changed with the configure widget command.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-height Database Name: height Database
Class: Height</p>

<p>Specifies the desired height for the window in any of
the forms acceptable to Tk_GetPixels. If this option is less
than or equal to zero then the window will not request any
size at all.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-labelanchor Database Name:
labelAnchor Database Class: LabelAnchor</p>

<p>Specifies where to place the label. A label is only
displayed if the -text option is not the empty string. Valid
values for this option are (listing them clockwise) nw, n,
ne, en, e, es, se, s,sw, ws, w and wn. The default value is
nw.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-labelwidget Database Name:
labelWidget Database Class: LabelWidget</p>

<p>Specifies a widget to use as label. This overrides any
-text option. The widget must exist before being used as
-labelwidget and if it is not a descendant of this window,
it will be raised above it in the stacking order.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-visual Database Name: visual Database
Class: Visual</p>

<p>Specifies visual information for the new window in any
of the forms accepted by Tk_GetVisual. If this option is not
speci- fied, the new window will use the same visual as its
parent. The visual option may not be modified with the
configure widget command.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-width Database Name: width Database
Class: Width</p>

<p>Specifies the desired width for the window in any of the
forms acceptable to Tk_GetPixels. If this option is less
than or equal to zero then the window will not request any
size at all.

<p>DESCRIPTION The labelframe command creates a new window
(given by the pathName argument) and makes it into a
labelframe widget. Additional options, described above, may
be specified on the command line or in the option database
to configure aspects of the labelframe such as its
background color and relief. The labelframe command returns
the path name of the new window.</p>

<p>A labelframe is a simple widget. Its primary purpose is
to act as a spacer or container for complex window layouts.
It has the features of a frame plus the ability to display a
label.</p>

<p>WIDGET COMMAND The labelframe command creates a new Tcl
command whose name is the same as the path name of the
labelframes window. This command may be used to invoke
various operations on the widget. It has the following gen-
eral form: pathName option ?arg arg ...? PathName is the
name of the command, which is the same as the label- frame
widgets path name. Option and the args determine the exact
behavior of the command. The following commands are possible
for frame widgets:</p>

<p>pathName cget option Returns the current value of the
configuration option given by option. Option may have any of
the values accepted by the labelframe command.</p>

<p>pathName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?
Query or modify the configuration options of the widget. If
no option is specified, returns a list describing all of the
avail- able options for pathName (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for
information on the format of this list). If option is
specified with no value, then the command returns a list
describing the one named option (this list will be identical
to the corresponding sublist of the value returned if no
option is specified). If one or more option-value pairs are
specified, then the command modifies the given widget
option(s) to have the given value(s); in this case the
command returns an empty string. Option may have any of the
values accepted by the labelframe command.</p>

<p>BINDINGS When a new labelframe is created, it has no
default event bindings: labelframes are not intended to be
interactive.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE This shows how to build part of a GUI for a
hamburger vendor. The labelframe widgets are used to
organize the available choices by the kinds of things that
the choices are being made over.</p>

<p>grid [labelframe .burger -text &quot;Burger&quot;]
[labelframe .bun -text &quot;Bun&quot;] -sticky news grid
[labelframe .cheese -text &quot;Cheese Option&quot;]
[labelframe .pickle -text &quot;Pickle Option&quot;] -sticky
news foreach {type name val} { burger Beef beef burger Lamb
lamb burger Vegetarian beans</p>

<p>bun Plain white bun Sesame seeds bun Wholemeal brown</p>

<p>cheese None none cheese Cheddar cheddar cheese Edam edam
cheese Brie brie cheese Gruy00e8re gruyere cheese
&quot;Monterey Jack&quot; jack</p>

<p>pickle None none pickle Gherkins gherkins pickle Onions
onion pickle Chili chili } { set w [radiobutton .$type.$val
-text $name -anchor w -variable $type -value $val] pack $w
-side top -fill x } set burger beef set bun white set cheese
none set pickle none</p>
