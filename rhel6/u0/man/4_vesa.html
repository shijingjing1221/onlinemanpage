<p>NAME vesa - Generic VESA video driver</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS Section &quot;Device&quot; Identifier
&quot;devname&quot; Driver &quot;vesa&quot; ...
EndSection</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION vesa is an Xorg driver for generic VESA
video cards. It can drive most VESA-compatible video cards,
but only makes use of the basic standard VESA core that is
common to these cards. The driver supports depths 8, 15 16
and 24.</p>

<p>SUPPORTED HARDWARE The vesa driver supports most
VESA-compatible video cards. There are some known
exceptions, and those should be listed here.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION DETAILS Please refer to xorg.conf(5) for
general configuration details. This section only covers
configuration details specific to this driver.</p>

<p>The driver auto-detects the presence of VESA-compatible
hardware. The ChipSet name may optionally be specified in
the config file &quot;Device&quot; section, and will
override the auto-detection:</p>

<p>&quot;vesa&quot;</p>

<p>The following driver Options are supported:</p>

<p>Option &quot;ShadowFB&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Enable
or disable use of the shadow framebuffer layer. Default:
on.</p>

<p>This option is recommended for performance reasons.</p>

<p>Option &quot;ModeSetClearScreen&quot;
&quot;boolean&quot; Clear the screen on mode set. Some
BIOSes seem to be broken in the sense that the newly set
video mode is bogus if they are asked to clear the screen
during mode setting. If you experience problems try to turn
this option off. Default: on.</p>
