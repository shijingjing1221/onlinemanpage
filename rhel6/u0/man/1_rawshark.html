<p>RAWSHARK(1) The Wireshark Network Analyzer
RAWSHARK(1)</p>

<p>NAME rawshark - Dump and analyze raw libpcap data</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rawshark [ -d
&lt;encap:dlt&gt;|&lt;proto:protoname&gt; ] [ -F &lt;field
to display&gt; ] [ -h ] [ -l ] [ -n ] [ -N &lt;name
resolving flags&gt; ] [ -o &lt;preference setting&gt; ] ...
[ -r &lt;infile or pipe&gt; ] [ -R &lt;read (display)
filter&gt; ] [ -s ] [ -S &lt;field format&gt; ] [ -t
ad|a|r|d|e ] [ -v ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Rawshark reads a stream of packets from a
file or pipe, and prints a line describing its output,
followed by a set of matching fields for each packet on
stdout.</p>

<p>INPUT Unlike TShark, Rawshark makes no assumptions about
encapsulation or input. The -d and -r flags must be
specified in order for it to run. One or more -F flags
should be specified in order for the output to be useful.
The other flags listed above follow the same conventions as
Wireshark and TShark.</p>

<p>Rawshark expects input records with the following
format. Note that this matches the pcap_pkthdr struct and
packet data used in libpcap.</p>

<p>struct rawshark_rec_s { uint32_t ts_sec; /* Time stamp
(seconds) */ uint32_t ts_usec; /* Time stamp (microseconds)
*/ uint32_t caplen; /* Length of the packet buffer */
uint32_t len; /* &quot;On the wire&quot; length of the
packet */ uint8_t data[caplen]; /* Packet data */ };</p>

<p>OUTPUT If one or more fields are specified via the -F
flag, Rawshark prints the number, field type, and display
format for each field on the first line as &quot;packet
number&quot; 0. For each record, the packet number, matching
fields, and a &quot;1&quot; or &quot;0&quot; are printed to
indicate if the field matched any supplied display filter. A
&quot;-&quot; is used to signal the end of a field
description and at the end of each packet line. For example,
the flags -F ip.src -F dns.qry.type might generate the
following output:</p>

<p>0 FT_IPv4 BASE_NONE - 1 FT_UINT16 BASE_HEX - 1
1=&quot;1&quot; 0=&quot;192.168.77.10&quot; 1 - 2
1=&quot;1&quot; 0=&quot;192.168.77.250&quot; 1 - 3
0=&quot;192.168.77.10&quot; 1 - 4
0=&quot;74.125.19.104&quot; 1 -</p>

<p>Note that packets 1 and 2 are DNS queries, and 3 and 4
are not. Adding -R &quot;not dns&quot; still prints each
line, but theres an indication that packets 1 and 2 didnt
pass the filter:</p>

<p>0 FT_IPv4 BASE_NONE - 1 FT_UINT16 BASE_HEX - 1
1=&quot;1&quot; 0=&quot;192.168.77.10&quot; 0 - 2
1=&quot;1&quot; 0=&quot;192.168.77.250&quot; 0 - 3
0=&quot;192.168.77.10&quot; 1 - 4
0=&quot;74.125.19.104&quot; 1 -</p>

<p>Also note that the output may be in any order, and that
multiple matching fields might be displayed.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -d &lt;encapsulation&gt; Specify how the packet
data should be dissected. The encapsulation is of the form
type:value, where type is one of:</p>

<p>encap:name Packet data should be dissected using the
libpcap data link type name, e.g. encap:EN10MB for
Ethernet.</p>

<p>encap:name Packet data should be dissected using the
libpcap data link type (DLT) name, e.g. encap:EN10MB for
Ethernet. Names are converted using
pcap_datalink_name_to_val().</p>

<p>encap:number Packet data should be dissected using the
libpcap DLT number, e.g. encap:105 for raw IEEE 802.11. A
complete list of DLTs can be found in pcap-bpf.h in the
libpcap sources.</p>

<p>proto:protocol Packet data should be passed to the
specified Wireshark protocol dissector, e.g. proto:http for
HTTP data.</p>

<p>-F &lt;field to display&gt; Add the matching field to
the output. Fields are any valid display filter field. More
than one -F flag may be specified, and each field can match
multiple times in a given packet. A single field may be
specified per -F flag. If you want to apply a display
filter, use the -R flag.</p>

<p>-h Print the version and options and exits.</p>

<p>-l Flush the standard output after the information for
each packet is printed. (This is not, strictly speaking,
line-buffered if -V was specified; however, it is the same
as line-buffered if -V wasnt specified, as only one line is
printed for each packet, and, as -l is normally used when
piping a live capture to a program or script, so that output
for a packet shows up as soon as the packet is seen and
dissected, it should work just as well as true
line-buffering. We do this as a workaround for a deficiency
in the Microsoft Visual C++ C library.)</p>

<p>This may be useful when piping the output of TShark to
another program, as it means that the program to which the
output is piped will see the dissected data for a packet as
soon as TShark sees the packet and generates that output,
rather than seeing it only when the standard output buffer
containing that data fills up.</p>

<p>-n Disable network object name resolution (such as
hostname, TCP and UDP port names), the -N flag might
override this one.</p>

<p>-N &lt;name resolving flags&gt; Turn on name resolving
only for particular types of addresses and port numbers,
with name resolving for other types of addresses and port
numbers turned off. This flag overrides -n if both -N and -n
are present. If both -N and -n flags are not present, all
name resolutions are turned on.</p>

<p>The argument is a string that may contain the
letters:</p>

<p>m to enable MAC address resolution</p>

<p>n to enable network address resolution</p>

<p>t to enable transport-layer port number resolution</p>

<p>C to enable concurrent (asynchronous) DNS lookups</p>

<p>-o &lt;preference&gt;:&lt;value&gt; Set a preference
value, overriding the default value and any value read from
a preference file. The argument to the option is a string of
the form prefname:value, where prefname is the name of the
preference (which is the same name that would appear in the
preference file), and value is the value to which it should
be set.</p>

<p>-r &lt;input file or pipe&gt; Read packet data from
input source. It can be a regular file or pipe, and must be
have the record format specified above.</p>

<p>-R &lt;read (display) filter&gt; Cause the specified
filter (which uses the syntax of read/display filters,
rather than that of capture filters) to be applied before
printing the output.</p>

<p>-s Allows standard pcap files to be used as input, by
skipping over the 24 byte pcap file header.</p>

<p>-S Use the specified format string to print each field.
The following formats are supported:</p>

<p>%D Field name or description, e.g. &quot;Type&quot; for
dns.qry.type</p>

<p>%N Base 10 numeric value of the field.</p>

<p>%S String value of the field.</p>

<p>For something similar to Wiresharks standard display
(&quot;Type: A (1)&quot;) you could use %D: %S (%N).</p>

<p>-t ad|a|r|d|e Set the format of the packet timestamp
printed in summary lines, the default is relative. The
format can be one of:</p>

<p>ad absolute with date: The absolute date and time is the
actual time and date the packet was captured</p>

<p>a absolute: The absolute time is the actual time the
packet was captured, with no date displayed</p>

<p>r relative: The relative time is the time elapsed
between the first packet and the current packet</p>

<p>d delta: The delta time is the time since the previous
packet was captured</p>

<p>e epoch: The time in seconds since epoch (Jan 1, 1970
00:00:00)</p>

<p>-v Print the version and exit.</p>

<p>READ FILTER SYNTAX For a complete table of protocol and
protocol fields that are filterable in TShark see the
wireshark-filter(4) manual page.</p>

<p>FILES These files contains various Wireshark
configuration values.</p>

<p>Preferences The preferences files contain global
(system-wide) and personal preference settings. If the
system-wide preference file exists, it is read first,
overriding the default settings. If the personal preferences
file exists, it is read next, overriding any previous
values. Note: If the command line option -o is used
(possibly more than once), it will in turn override values
from the preferences files.</p>

<p>The preferences settings are in the form prefname:value,
one per line, where prefname is the name of the preference
and value is the value to which it should be set; white
space is allowed between : and value. A preference setting
can be continued on subsequent lines by indenting the
continuation lines with white space. A # character starts a
comment that runs to the end of the line:</p>

<p># Capture in promiscuous mode? # TRUE or FALSE
(case-insensitive). capture.prom_mode: TRUE</p>

<p>The global preferences file is looked for in the
wireshark directory under the share subdirectory of the main
installation directory (for example,
/usr/local/share/wireshark/preferences) on UNIX-compatible
systems, and in the main installation directory (for
example, C:Program FilesWiresharkpreferences) on Windows
systems.</p>

<p>The personal preferences file is looked for in
$HOME/.wireshark/preferences on UNIX-compatible systems and
%APPDATA%Wiresharkpreferences (or, if %APPDATA% isnt
defined, %USERPROFILE%Application DataWiresharkpreferences)
on Windows systems.</p>

<p>Disabled (Enabled) Protocols The disabled_protos files
contain system-wide and personal lists of protocols that
have been disabled, so that their dissectors are never
called. The files contain protocol names, one per line,
where the protocol name is the same name that would be used
in a display filter for the protocol:</p>

<p>http tcp # a comment</p>

<p>The global disabled_protos file uses the same directory
as the global preferences file.</p>

<p>The personal disabled_protos file uses the same
directory as the personal preferences file.</p>

<p>Name Resolution (hosts) If the personal hosts file
exists, it is used to resolve IPv4 and IPv6 addresses before
any other attempts are made to resolve them. The file has
the standard hosts file syntax; each line contains one IP
address and name, separated by whitespace. The same
directory as for the personal preferences file is used.</p>

<p>Name Resolution (ethers) The ethers files are consulted
to correlate 6-byte hardware addresses to names. First the
personal ethers file is tried and if an address is not found
there the global ethers file is tried next.</p>

<p>Each line contains one hardware address and name,
separated by whitespace. The digits of the hardware address
are separated by colons (:), dashes (-) or periods (.). The
same separator character must be used consistently in an
address. The following three lines are valid lines of an
ethers file:</p>

<p>ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff Broadcast c0-00-ff-ff-ff-ff
TR_broadcast 00.00.00.00.00.00 Zero_broadcast</p>

<p>The global ethers file is looked for in the /etc
directory on UNIX- compatible systems, and in the main
installation directory (for example, C:Program
FilesWireshark) on Windows systems.</p>

<p>The personal ethers file is looked for in the same
directory as the personal preferences file.</p>

<p>Name Resolution (manuf) The manuf file is used to match
the 3-byte vendor portion of a 6-byte hardware address with
the manufacturers name; it can also contain well-known MAC
addresses and address ranges specified with a netmask. The
format of the file is the same as the ethers files, except
that entries of the form:</p>

<p>00:00:0C Cisco</p>

<p>can be provided, with the 3-byte OUI and the name for a
vendor, and entries such as:</p>

<p>00-00-0C-07-AC/40 All-HSRP-routers</p>

<p>can be specified, with a MAC address and a mask
indicating how many bits of the address must match. The
above entry, for example, has 40 significant bits, or 5
bytes, and would match addresses from 00-00-0C-07-AC-00
through 00-00-0C-07-AC-FF. The mask need not be a multiple
of 8.</p>

<p>The manuf file is looked for in the same directory as
the global preferences file.</p>

<p>Name Resolution (ipxnets) The ipxnets files are used to
correlate 4-byte IPX network numbers to names. First the
global ipxnets file is tried and if that address is not
found there the personal one is tried next.</p>

<p>The format is the same as the ethers file, except that
each address is four bytes instead of six. Additionally, the
address can be represented as a single hexadecimal number,
as is more common in the IPX world, rather than four hex
octets. For example, these four lines are valid lines of an
ipxnets file:</p>

<p>C0.A8.2C.00 HR c0-a8-1c-00 CEO 00:00:BE:EF IT_Server1
110f FileServer3</p>

<p>The global ipxnets file is looked for in the /etc
directory on UNIX-compatible systems, and in the main
installation directory (for example, C:Program
FilesWireshark) on Windows systems.</p>

<p>The personal ipxnets file is looked for in the same
directory as the personal preferences file.</p>
