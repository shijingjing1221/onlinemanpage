<p>VIRT-IMAGE(1) Virtual Machine Install Tools
VIRT-IMAGE(1)</p>

<p>NAME virt-image - create virtual machines from an image
descriptor</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS virt-image [OPTION]... IMAGE.XML</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION virt-image is a command line tool for
creating virtual machines from an XML image descriptor
&quot;IMAGE.XML&quot; (virt-image(5)). Most attributes of
the virtual machine are taken from the XML descriptor (e.g.,
where the files to back the virtual machines disks are and
how to map them into the guest), though certain information
must be added on the command line, such as the name of the
guest.</p>

<p>The XML descriptor defines most attributes of the guest,
making it possible to bundle and distribute it together with
the files backing the guests disks.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Most options can be omitted, in which case
virt-image will use defaults from the XML descriptor. When
defaults are taken from the XML descriptor, they are
indicated below as a path. --name is the only required
command line option.</p>

<p>-h, --help Show the help message and exit</p>

<p>--connect=CONNECT Connect to a non-default hypervisor.
See virt-install(1) for details</p>

<p>General Options</p>

<p>General configuration parameters that apply to all types
of guest installs.</p>

<p>-n NAME, --name=NAME Name of the guest instance</p>

<p>-r MEMORY, --ram=MEMORY Memory to allocate for guest
instance in megabytes. Defaults to
&quot;/image/devices/memory&quot; in the XML descriptor.</p>

<p>-u UUID, --uuid=UUID UUID for the guest; if none is
given a random UUID will be generated. If you specify UUID,
you should use a 32-digit hexadecimal number.</p>

<p>--vcpus=VCPUS Number of vcpus to configure for your
guest. Defaults to &quot;/image/devices/vcpu&quot; in the
XML descriptor.</p>

<p>--check-cpu Check that vcpus do not exceed physical CPUs
and warn if they do.</p>

<p>--os-type=OS_TYPE Optimize the guest configuration for a
type of operating system (ex. linux , windows ). This will
attempt to pick the most suitable ACPI &amp; APIC settings,
optimally supported mouse drivers, virtio, and generally
accommodate other operating system quirks. See
virt-install(1) for valid values.</p>

<p>--os-variant=OS_VARIANT Further optimize the guest
configuration for a specific operating system variant (ex.
fedora8, winxp). This parameter is optional, and does not
require an &quot;--os-type&quot; to be specified. See
virt-install(1) for valid values.</p>

<p>Full Virtualization specific options</p>

<p>Parameters specific only to fully virtualized guest
installs.</p>

<p>--noapic Disables APIC for fully virtualized guest
(overrides value in XML descriptor)</p>

<p>--noacpi Disables ACPI for fully virtualized guest
(overrides value in XML descriptor)</p>

<p>Networking Configuration</p>

<p>-m MAC, --mac=MAC This is deprecated in favor of
&quot;--network ...,mac=MAC,...&quot;</p>

<p>-b BRIDGE, --bridge=BRIDGE This is deprecated in favor
of &quot;--network bridge=BRIDGE&quot;</p>

<p>-w NETWORK, --network=NETWORK Connect the guest to the
host network. See virt-install(1) for details</p>

<p>Graphics Configuration</p>

<p>If no graphics option is specified,
&quot;virt-install&quot; will default to --vnc if the
DISPLAY environment variable is set, otherwise --nographics
is used.</p>

<p>--vnc Setup a virtual console in the guest and export it
as a VNC server in the host. See virt-install(1) for
details</p>

<p>--vncport=VNCPORT Request a permanent, statically
assigned port number for the guest VNC console. See
virt-install(1) for details</p>

<p>--vnclisten=VNCLISTEN Address to listen on for VNC
connections. See virt-install(1) for details.</p>

<p>-k KEYMAP, --keymap=KEYMAP Request that the virtual VNC
console be configured to run with a non- English keyboard
layout.</p>

<p>--sdl Setup a virtual console in the guest and display
an SDL window in the host to render the output. See
virt-install(1) for details</p>

<p>--nographics Do not attach a graphical device to the
guest. See virt-install(1) for details</p>

<p>Miscellaneous Options</p>

<p>-p, --print Print the libvirt XML, but do not start the
guest.</p>

<p>--boot=BOOT The zero-based index of the boot record to
use. The XML descriptor can contain multiple
&quot;/image/domain/boot&quot; elements for use on different
hypervisors. By default, the one that is most appropriate
for the current hypervisor is selected.</p>

<p>--replace Shutdown and remove any existing guest with
the passed &quot;--name&quot; before installing from the
image.</p>

<p>--skip-checksum Do not check disk images against
checksums (if they are listed in the image xml).</p>

<p>-d, --debug Print debugging information</p>

<p>--force Prevent interactive prompts. If the intended
prompt was a yes/no prompt, always say yes. For any other
prompts, the application will exit.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Create and start a guest called
&quot;example&quot; with a VNC console from
&quot;image.xml&quot;:</p>

<p># virt-image --name example --vnc -i image.xml</p>

<p>Print the libvirt XML for a guest called
&quot;example&quot; without graphics, but do not create or
start a virtual machine:</p>

<p># virt-image --print --name example --nographics --image
image.xml</p>
