<p>TRANSPORT_SETUP_DEVI(9) Device drivers infrastructure
TRANSPORT_SETUP_DEVI(9)</p>

<p>NAME transport_setup_device - declare a new dev for
transport class association but don&acute;t make it visible
yet.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS void transport_setup_device(struct device *
dev);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS dev the generic device representing the entity
being added</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Usually, dev represents some component in
the HBA system (either the HBA itself or a device remote
across the HBA bus). This routine is simply a trigger point
to see if any set of transport classes wishes to associate
with the added device. This allocates storage for the class
device and initialises it, but does not yet add it to the
system or add attributes to it (you do this with
transport_add_device). If you have no need for a separate
setup and add operations, use transport_register_device (see
transport_class.h).</p>
