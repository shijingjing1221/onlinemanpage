<p>NAME pvresize - resize a disk or partition in use by
LVM2</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pvresize [-d|--debug] [-h|--help] [-t|--test]
[-v|--verbose] [--set- physicalvolumesizesize]
PhysicalVolume [PhysicalVolume...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pvresize resizes PhysicalVolume which may
already be in a volume group and have active logical volumes
allocated on it.</p>

<p>OPTIONS See lvm(8) for common options.</p>

<p>--setphysicalvolumesize size Overrides the
automatically-detected size of the PV. Use with care, or
prior to reducing the physical size of the device.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Expand the PV on /dev/sda1 after enlarging the
partition with fdisk:</p>

<p>pvresize /dev/sda1</p>

<p>Shrink the PV on /dev/sda1 prior to shrinking the
partition with fdisk (ensure that the PV size is appropriate
for your intended new partition size):</p>

<p>pvresize --setphysicalvolumesize 40G /dev/sda1</p>

<p>RESTRICTIONS pvresize will refuse to shrink
PhysicalVolume if it has allocated extents after where its
new end would be. In the future, it should relocate these
elsewhere in the volume group if there is sufficient free
space, like pvmove does.</p>

<p>pvresize wont currently work correctly on LVM1 volumes
or PVs with extra metadata areas.</p>
