<p>NAME ldap_abandon_ext - Abandon an LDAP operation in
progress</p>

<p>LIBRARY OpenLDAP LDAP (libldap, -lldap)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;ldap.h&gt;</p>

<p>int ldap_abandon_ext( LDAP *ld, Bint msgid, LDAPControl
**sctrls, LDAPControl **cctrls );</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The ldap_abandon_ext() routine is used to
send a LDAP Abandon request for an operation in progress.
The msgid passed should be the message id of an outstanding
LDAP operation, such as returned by ldap_search_ext(3).</p>

<p>ldap_abandon_ext() checks to see if the result of the
operation has already come in. If it has, it deletes it from
the queue of pending messages. If not, it sends an LDAP
abandon request to the LDAP server.</p>

<p>The caller can expect that the result of an abandoned
operation will not be returned from a future call to
ldap_result(3).</p>

<p>ldap_abandon_ext() allows server and client controls to
be passed in via the sctrls and cctrls parameters,
respectively.</p>

<p>ldap_abandon_ext() returns a code indicating success or,
in the case of failure, the nature of the failure. See
ldap_error(3) for details.</p>

<p>DEPRECATED INTERFACES The ldap_abandon() routine is
deprecated in favor of the ldap_aban- don_ext() routine.</p>

<p>Deprecated interfaces generally remain in the library.
The macro LDAP_DEPRECATED can be defined to a non-zero value
(e.g., -DLDAP_DEPRE- CATED=1) when compiling program
designed to use deprecated interfaces. It is recommended
that developers writing new programs, or updating old
programs, avoid use of deprecated interfaces. Over time, it
is expected that documentation (and, eventually, support)
for deprecated interfaces to be eliminated.</p>
