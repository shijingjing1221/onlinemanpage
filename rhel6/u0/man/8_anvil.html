<p>NAME anvil - Postfix session count and request rate
control</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS anvil [generic Postfix daemon options]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The Postfix anvil(8) server maintains
statistics about client connec- tion counts or client
request rates. This information can be used to defend
against clients that hammer a server with either too many
simul- taneous sessions, or with too many successive
requests within a config- urable time interval. This server
is designed to run under control by the Postfix master(8)
server.</p>

<p>In the following text, ident specifies a (service,
client) combination. The exact syntax of that information is
application-dependent; the anvil(8) server does not
care.</p>

<p>CONNECTION COUNT/RATE CONTROL To register a new
connection send the following request to the anvil(8)
server:</p>

<p>request=connect ident=string</p>

<p>The anvil(8) server answers with the number of
simultaneous connections and the number of connections per
unit time for the (service, client) combination specified
with ident:</p>

<p>status=0 count=number rate=number</p>

<p>To register a disconnect event send the following
request to the anvil(8) server:</p>

<p>request=disconnect ident=string</p>

<p>The anvil(8) server replies with:</p>

<p>status=0</p>

<p>MESSAGE RATE CONTROL To register a message delivery
request send the following request to the anvil(8)
server:</p>

<p>request=message ident=string</p>

<p>The anvil(8) server answers with the number of message
delivery requests per unit time for the (service, client)
combination specified with ident:</p>

<p>status=0 rate=number</p>

<p>RECIPIENT RATE CONTROL To register a recipient request
send the following request to the anvil(8) server:</p>

<p>request=recipient ident=string</p>

<p>The anvil(8) server answers with the number of recipient
addresses per unit time for the (service, client)
combination specified with ident:</p>

<p>status=0 rate=number</p>

<p>TLS SESSION NEGOTIATION RATE CONTROL The features
described in this section are available with Postfix 2.3 and
later.</p>

<p>To register a request for a new (i.e. not cached) TLS
session send the following request to the anvil(8)
server:</p>

<p>request=newtls ident=string</p>

<p>The anvil(8) server answers with the number of new TLS
session requests per unit time for the (service, client)
combination specified with ident:</p>

<p>status=0 rate=number</p>

<p>To retrieve new TLS session request rate information
without updating the counter information, send:</p>

<p>request=newtls_report ident=string</p>

<p>The anvil(8) server answers with the number of new TLS
session requests per unit time for the (service, client)
combination specified with ident:</p>

<p>status=0 rate=number</p>

<p>SECURITY The anvil(8) server does not talk to the
network or to local users, and can run chrooted at fixed low
privilege.</p>

<p>The anvil(8) server maintains an in-memory table with
information about recent clients requests. No persistent
state is kept because standard system library routines are
not sufficiently robust for update-inten- sive
applications.</p>

<p>Although the in-memory state is kept only temporarily,
this may require a lot of memory on systems that handle
connections from many remote clients. To reduce memory
usage, reduce the time unit over which state is kept.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS Problems and transactions are logged to
syslogd(8).</p>

<p>Upon exit, and every anvil_status_update_time seconds,
the server logs the maximal count and rate values measured,
together with (service, client) information and the time of
day associated with those events. In order to avoid
unnecessary overhead, no measurements are done for activity
that isnt concurrency limited or rate limited.</p>

<p>BUGS Systems behind network address translating routers
or proxies appear to have the same client address and can
run into connection count and/or rate limits falsely.</p>

<p>In this preliminary implementation, a count (or rate)
limited server process can have only one remote client at a
time. If a server process reports multiple simultaneous
clients, state is kept only for the last reported
client.</p>

<p>The anvil(8) server automatically discards client
request information after it expires. To prevent the
anvil(8) server from discarding client request rate
information too early or too late, a rate limited service
should always register connect/disconnect events even when
it does not explicitly limit them.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS On low-traffic mail systems,
changes to main.cf are picked up automati- cally as anvil(8)
processes run for only a limited amount of time. On other
mail systems, use the command &quot;postfix reload&quot; to
speed up a change.</p>

<p>The text below provides only a parameter summary. See
postconf(5) for more details including examples.</p>

<p>anvil_rate_time_unit (60s) The time unit over which
client connection rates and other rates are calculated.</p>

<p>anvil_status_update_time (600s) How frequently the
anvil(8) connection and rate limiting server logs peak usage
information.</p>

<p>config_directory (seepostconf -doutput) The default
location of the Postfix main.cf and master.cf con-
figuration files.</p>

<p>daemon_timeout (18000s) How much time a Postfix daemon
process may take to handle a request before it is terminated
by a built-in watchdog timer.</p>

<p>ipc_timeout (3600s) The time limit for sending or
receiving information over an internal communication
channel.</p>

<p>max_idle (100s) The maximum amount of time that an idle
Postfix daemon process waits for an incoming connection
before terminating voluntarily.</p>

<p>max_use (100) The maximal number of incoming connections
that a Postfix daemon process will service before
terminating voluntarily.</p>

<p>process_id (read-only) The process ID of a Postfix
command or daemon process.</p>

<p>process_name (read-only) The process name of a Postfix
command or daemon process.</p>

<p>syslog_facility (mail) The syslog facility of Postfix
logging.</p>

<p>syslog_name (seepostconf -doutput) The mail system name
that is prepended to the process name in syslog records, so
that &quot;smtpd&quot; becomes, for example, &quot;post-
fix/smtpd&quot;.</p>

<p>HISTORY The anvil service is available in Postfix 2.2
and later.</p>
