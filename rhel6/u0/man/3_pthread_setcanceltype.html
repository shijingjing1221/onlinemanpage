<p>PTHREAD_SETCANCELSTATE(3) Linux Programmer s Manual
PTHREAD_SETCANCELSTATE(3)</p>

<p>NAME pthread_setcancelstate, pthread_setcanceltype - set
cancelability state and type</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;</p>

<p>int pthread_setcancelstate(int state, int *oldstate);
int pthread_setcanceltype(int type, int *oldtype);</p>

<p>Compile and link with -pthread.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pthread_setcancelstate() sets the
cancelability state of the call- ing thread to the value
given in state. The previous cancelability state of the
thread is returned in the buffer pointed to by oldstate. The
state argument must have one of the following values:</p>

<p>PTHREAD_CANCEL_ENABLE The thread is cancelable. This is
the default cancelability state in all new threads,
including the initial thread. The thread s cancelability
type determines when a cancelable thread will respond to a
cancellation request.</p>

<p>PTHREAD_CANCEL_DISABLE The thread is not cancelable. If
a cancellation request is received, it is blocked until
cancelability is enabled.</p>

<p>The pthread_setcanceltype() sets the cancelability type
of the calling thread to the value given in type. The
previous cancelability type of the thread is returned in the
buffer pointed to by oldtype. The type argument must have
one of the following values:</p>

<p>PTHREAD_CANCEL_DEFERRED A cancellation request is
deferred until the thread next calls a function that is a
cancellation point (see pthreads(7)). This is the default
cancelability type in all new threads, including the initial
thread.</p>

<p>PTHREAD_CANCEL_ASYNCHRONOUS The thread can be canceled
at any time. (Typically, it will be canceled immediately
upon receiving a cancellation request, but the system doesnt
guarantee this.)</p>

<p>The set-and-get operation performed by each of these
functions is atomic with respect to other threads in the
process calling the same function.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, these functions return 0; on
error, they return a non-zero error number.</p>

<p>ERRORS The pthread_setcancelstate() can fail with the
following error:</p>

<p>EINVAL Invalid value for state.</p>

<p>The pthread_setcanceltype() can fail with the following
error:</p>

<p>EINVAL Invalid value for type.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>NOTES For details of what happens when a thread is
canceled, see pthread_can- cel(3).</p>

<p>Briefly disabling cancelability is useful if a thread
performs some critical action that must not be interrupted
by a cancellation request. Beware of disabling cancelability
for long periods, or around opera- tions that may block for
long periods, since that will render the thread unresponsive
to cancellation requests.</p>

<p>Setting the cancelability type to
PTHREAD_CANCEL_ASYNCHRONOUS is rarely useful. Since the
thread could be canceled at any time, it cannot safely
reserve resources (e.g., allocating memory with malloc(3)),
acquire mutexes, semaphores, or locks, and so on. Reserving
resources is unsafe because the application has no way of
knowing what the state of these resources is when the thread
is canceled; that is, did cancel- lation occur before the
resources were reserved, while they were reserved, or after
they were released? Furthermore, some internal data
structures (e.g., the linked list of free blocks managed by
the mal- loc(3) family of functions) may be left in an
inconsistent state if cancellation occurs in the middle of
the function call. Consequently, clean-up handlers cease to
be useful. Functions that can be safely asynchronously
canceled are called async-cancel-safe functions.
POSIX.1-2001 only requires that pthread_cancel(3),
pthread_setcancel- state(), and pthread_setcanceltype() be
async-cancel-safe. In general, other library functions cant
be safely called from an asynchronously cancelable thread.
One of the few circumstances in which asynchronous
cancelability is useful is for cancellation of a thread that
is in a pure compute-bound loop.</p>

<p>The Linux threading implementations permit the oldstate
argument of pthread_setcancelstate() to be NULL, in which
case the information about the previous cancelability state
is not returned to the caller. Many other implementations
also permit a NULL oldstat argument, but POSIX.1-2001 does
not specify this point, so portable applications should
always specify a non-NULL value in oldstate. A precisely
analo- gous set of statements applies for the oldtype
argument of pthread_set- canceltype().</p>
