<p>NAME idmap_hash - Samba&acute;s idmap_hash Backend for
Winbind</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The idmap_hash plugin implements a hashing
algorithm used to map SIDs for domain users and groups to
31-bit uids and gids, respectively. This plugin also
implements the nss_info API and can be used to support a
local name mapping files if enabled via the &quot;winbind
normalize names&quot; and &quot;winbind nss info&quot;
parameters in smb.conf.</p>

<p>IDMAP OPTIONS name_map Specifies the absolute path to
the name mapping file used by the nss_info API. Entries in
the file are of the form &quot;unix name = qualified domain
name&quot;. Mapping of both user and group names is
supported.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES The following example utilizes the idmap_hash
plugin for the idmap and nss_info information.</p>

<p>[global] idmap backend = hash idmap uid =
1000-4000000000 idmap gid = 1000-4000000000</p>

<p>winbind nss info = hash winbind normalize names = yes
idmap_hash:name_map = /etc/samba/name_map.cfg</p>

<p>AUTHOR The original Samba software and related utilities
were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by
the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way
the Linux kernel is developed.</p>
