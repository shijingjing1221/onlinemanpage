<p>SEMCTL(2) Linux Programmer s Manual SEMCTL(2)</p>

<p>NAME semctl - semaphore control operations</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; #include
&lt;sys/ipc.h&gt; #include &lt;sys/sem.h&gt;</p>

<p>int semctl(int semid, int semnum, int cmd, ...);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION semctl() performs the control operation
specified by cmd on the semaphore set identified by semid,
or on the semnum-th semaphore of that set. (The semaphores
in a set are numbered starting at 0.)</p>

<p>This function has three or four arguments, depending on
cmd. When there are four, the fourth has the type union
semun. The calling pro- gram must define this union as
follows:</p>

<p>union semun { int val; /* Value for SETVAL */ struct
semid_ds *buf; /* Buffer for IPC_STAT, IPC_SET */ unsigned
short *array; /* Array for GETALL, SETALL */ struct seminfo
*__buf; /* Buffer for IPC_INFO (Linux-specific) */ };</p>

<p>The semid_ds data structure is defined in
&lt;sys/sem.h&gt; as follows:</p>

<p>struct semid_ds { struct ipc_perm sem_perm; /* Ownership
and permissions */ time_t sem_otime; /* Last semop time */
time_t sem_ctime; /* Last change time */ unsigned short
sem_nsems; /* No. of semaphores in set */ };</p>

<p>The ipc_perm structure is defined in &lt;sys/ipc.h&gt;
as follows (the high- lighted fields are settable using
IPC_SET):</p>

<p>struct ipc_perm { key_t __key; /* Key supplied to
semget(2) */ uid_t uid; /* Effective UID of owner */ gid_t
gid; /* Effective GID of owner */ uid_t cuid; /* Effective
UID of creator */ gid_t cgid; /* Effective GID of creator */
unsigned short mode; /* Permissions */ unsigned short __seq;
/* Sequence number */ };</p>

<p>Valid values for cmd are:</p>

<p>IPC_STAT Copy information from the kernel data structure
associated with semid into the semid_ds structure pointed to
by arg.buf. The argument semnum is ignored. The calling
process must have read permission on the semaphore set.</p>

<p>IPC_SET Write the values of some members of the semid_ds
structure pointed to by arg.buf to the kernel data structure
associated with this semaphore set, updating also its
sem_ctime member. The following members of the structure are
updated: sem_perm.uid, sem_perm.gid, and (the least
significant 9 bits of) sem_perm.mode. The effective UID of
the calling process must match the owner (sem_perm.uid) or
creator (sem_perm.cuid) of the semaphore set, or the caller
must be privileged. The argument semnum is ignored.</p>

<p>IPC_RMID Immediately remove the semaphore set, awakening
all processes blocked in semop(2) calls on the set (with an
error return and errno set to EIDRM). The effective user ID
of the call- ing process must match the creator or owner of
the semaphore set, or the caller must be privileged. The
argument semnum is ignored.</p>

<p>IPC_INFO (Linux-specific) Returns information about
system-wide semaphore limits and parameters in the structure
pointed to by arg.__buf. This structure is of type seminfo,
defined in &lt;sys/sem.h&gt; if the _GNU_SOURCE feature test
macro is defined:</p>

<p>struct seminfo { int semmap; /* Number of entries in
semaphore map; unused within kernel */ int semmni; /*
Maximum number of semaphore sets */ int semmns; /* Maximum
number of semaphores in all semaphore sets */ int semmnu; /*
System-wide maximum number of undo structures; unused within
kernel */ int semmsl; /* Maximum number of semaphores in a
set */ int semopm; /* Maximum number of operations for
semop(2) */ int semume; /* Maximum number of undo entries
per process; unused within kernel */ int semusz; /* Size of
struct sem_undo */ int semvmx; /* Maximum semaphore value */
int semaem; /* Max. value that can be recorded for semaphore
adjustment (SEM_UNDO) */ };</p>

<p>The semmsl, semmns, semopm, and semmni settings can be
changed via /proc/sys/kernel/sem; see proc(5) for
details.</p>

<p>SEM_INFO (Linux-specific) Returns a seminfo structure
containing the same information as for IPC_INFO, except that
the following fields are returned with information about
system resources consumed by semaphores: the semusz field
returns the number of semaphore sets that currently exist on
the system; and the semaem field returns the total number of
semaphores in all semaphore sets on the system.</p>

<p>SEM_STAT (Linux-specific) Returns a semid_ds structure
as for IPC_STAT. However, the semid argument is not a
semaphore identifier, but instead an index into the kernel s
internal array that maintains infor- mation about all
semaphore sets on the system.</p>

<p>GETALL Return semval (i.e., the current value) for all
semaphores of the set into arg.array. The argument semnum is
ignored. The calling process must have read permission on
the semaphore set.</p>

<p>GETNCNT The system call returns the value of semncnt
(i.e., the num- ber of processes waiting for the value of
this semaphore to increase) for the semnum-th semaphore of
the set (i.e., the number of processes waiting for an
increase of semval for the semnum-th semaphore of the set).
The calling process must have read permission on the
semaphore set.</p>

<p>GETPID The system call returns the value of sempid for
the semnum-th semaphore of the set (i.e., the PID of the
process that exe- cuted the last semop(2) call for the
semnum-th semaphore of the set). The calling process must
have read permission on the semaphore set.</p>

<p>GETVAL The system call returns the value of semval for
the semnum-th semaphore of the set. The calling process must
have read permission on the semaphore set.</p>

<p>GETZCNT The system call returns the value of semzcnt
(i.e., the num- ber of processes waiting for the value of
this semaphore to become zero) for the semnum-th semaphore
of the set (i.e., the number of processes waiting for semval
of the semnum-th semaphore of the set to become 0). The
calling process must have read permission on the semaphore
set.</p>

<p>SETALL Set semval for all semaphores of the set using
arg.array, updating also the sem_ctime member of the
semid_ds structure associated with the set. Undo entries
(see semop(2)) are cleared for altered semaphores in all
processes. If the changes to semaphore values would permit
blocked semop(2) calls in other processes to proceed, then
those processes are woken up. The argument semnum is
ignored. The calling pro- cess must have alter (write)
permission on the semaphore set.</p>

<p>SETVAL Set the value of semval to arg.val for the
semnum-th semaphore of the set, updating also the sem_ctime
member of the semid_ds structure associated with the set.
Undo entries are cleared for altered semaphores in all
processes. If the changes to semaphore values would permit
blocked semop(2) calls in other processes to proceed, then
those processes are woken up. The calling process must have
alter permission on the semaphore set.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On failure semctl() returns -1 with errno
indicating the error.</p>

<p>Otherwise the system call returns a non-negative value
depending on cmd as follows:</p>

<p>GETNCNT the value of semncnt.</p>

<p>GETPID the value of sempid.</p>

<p>GETVAL the value of semval.</p>

<p>GETZCNT the value of semzcnt.</p>

<p>IPC_INFO the index of the highest used entry in the
kernels inter- nal array recording information about all
semaphore sets. (This information can be used with repeated
SEM_STAT opera- tions to obtain information about all
semaphore sets on the system.)</p>

<p>SEM_INFO As for IPC_INFO.</p>

<p>SEM_STAT the identifier of the semaphore set whose index
was given in semid.</p>

<p>All other cmd values return 0 on success.</p>

<p>ERRORS On failure, errno will be set to one of the
following:</p>

<p>EACCES The argument cmd has one of the values GETALL,
GETPID, GETVAL, GETNCNT, GETZCNT, IPC_STAT, SEM_STAT,
SETALL, or SETVAL and the calling process does not have the
required permissions on the semaphore set and does not have
the CAP_IPC_OWNER capability.</p>

<p>EFAULT The address pointed to by arg.buf or arg.array
isnt accessible.</p>

<p>EIDRM The semaphore set was removed.</p>

<p>EINVAL Invalid value for cmd or semid. Or: for a
SEM_STAT operation, the index value specified in semid
referred to an array slot that is currently unused.</p>

<p>EPERM The argument cmd has the value IPC_SET or IPC_RMID
but the effective user ID of the calling process is not the
creator (as found in sem_perm.cuid) or the owner (as found
in sem_perm.uid) of the semaphore set, and the process does
not have the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability.</p>

<p>ERANGE The argument cmd has the value SETALL or SETVAL
and the value to which semval is to be set (for some
semaphore of the set) is less than 0 or greater than the
implementation limit SEMVMX.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO SVr4, POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>NOTES The IPC_INFO, SEM_STAT and SEM_INFO operations are
used by the ipcs(8) program to provide information on
allocated resources. In the future these may modified or
moved to a /proc file system interface.</p>

<p>Various fields in a struct semid_ds were typed as short
under Linux 2.2 and have become long under Linux 2.4. To
take advantage of this, a recompilation under glibc-2.1.91
or later should suffice. (The kernel distinguishes old and
new calls by an IPC_64 flag in cmd.)</p>

<p>In some earlier versions of glibc, the semun union was
defined in &lt;sys/sem.h&gt;, but POSIX.1-2001 requires that
the caller define this union. On versions of glibc where
this union is not defined, the macro _SEM_SEMUN_UNDEFINED is
defined in &lt;sys/sem.h&gt;.</p>

<p>The following system limit on semaphore sets affects a
semctl() call:</p>

<p>SEMVMX Maximum value for semval: implementation
dependent (32767).</p>

<p>For greater portability it is best to always call
semctl() with four arguments.</p>
