<p>NAME eject - eject removable media</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS eject -h eject [-vnrsfmqp] [&lt;name&gt;] eject
[-vn] -d eject [-vn] -a on|off|1|0 [&lt;name&gt;] eject
[-vn] -c slot [&lt;name&gt;] eject [-vn] -i on|off|1|0
[&lt;name&gt;] eject [-vn] -t [&lt;name&gt;] eject [-vn] -T
[&lt;name&gt;] eject [-vn] -x &lt;speed&gt; [&lt;name&gt;]
eject [-vn] -X [&lt;name&gt;] eject -V</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Eject allows removable media (typically a
CD-ROM, floppy disk, tape, or JAZ or ZIP disk) to be ejected
under software control. The command can also control some
multi-disc CD-ROM changers, the auto-eject feature supported
by some devices, and close the disc tray of some CD-ROM
drives.</p>

<p>The device corresponding to &lt;name&gt; is ejected. The
name can be a device file or mount point, either a full path
or with the leading &quot;/dev&quot;, &quot;/media&quot; or
&quot;/mnt&quot; omitted. If no name is specified, the
default name &quot;cdrom&quot; is used.</p>

<p>There are four different methods of ejecting, depending
on whether the device is a CD-ROM, SCSI device, removable
floppy, or tape. By default eject tries all four methods in
order until it succeeds.</p>

<p>If the device is currently mounted, it is unmounted
before ejecting.</p>

<p>COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS -h This option causes eject to
display a brief description of the command options.</p>

<p>-v This makes eject run in verbose mode; more
information is dis- played about what the command is
doing.</p>

<p>-d If invoked with this option, eject lists the default
device name.</p>

<p>-a on|1|off|0 This option controls the auto-eject mode,
supported by some devices. When enabled, the drive
automatically ejects when the device is closed.</p>

<p>-c &lt;slot&gt; With this option a CD slot can be
selected from an ATAPI/IDE CD- ROM changer. Linux 2.0 or
higher is required to use this feature. The CD-ROM drive can
not be in use (mounted data CD or playing a music CD) for a
change request to work. Please also note that the first slot
of the changer is referred to as 0, not 1.</p>

<p>-i on|1|off|0 This option controls locking of the
hardware eject button. When enabled, the drive will not be
ejected when the button is pressed. This is useful when you
are carrying a laptop in a bag or case and don t want it to
eject if the button is inadvertently pressed.</p>

<p>-t With this option the drive is given a CD-ROM tray
close command. Not all devices support this command.</p>

<p>-T With this option the drive is given a CD-ROM tray
close command if its opened, and a CD-ROM tray eject command
if it s closed. Not all devices support this command,
because it uses the above CD-ROM tray close command.</p>

<p>-x &lt;speed&gt; With this option the drive is given a
CD-ROM select speed command. The speed argument is a number
indicating the desired speed (e.g. 8 for 8X speed), or 0 for
maximum data rate. Not all devices sup- port this command
and you can only specify speeds that the drive is capable
of. Every time the media is changed this option is cleared.
This option can be used alone, or with the -t and -c
options.</p>

<p>-X With this option the CD-ROM drive will be probed to
detect the available speeds. The output is a list of speeds
which can be used as an argument of the -x option. This only
works with Linux 2.6.13 or higher, on previous versions
solely the maximum speed will be reported. Also note that
some drive may not correctly report the speed and therefore
this option does not work with them.</p>

<p>-n With this option the selected device is displayed but
no action is performed.</p>

<p>-r This option specifies that the drive should be
ejected using a CDROM eject command.</p>

<p>-s This option specifies that the drive should be
ejected using SCSI commands.</p>

<p>-f This option specifies that the drive should be
ejected using a removable floppy disk eject command.</p>

<p>-q This option specifies that the drive should be
ejected using a tape drive offline command.</p>

<p>-p This option allow you to use /proc/mounts instead
/etc/mtab. It also passes the -n option to umount(1).</p>

<p>-m This option allows eject to work with device drivers
which auto- matically mount removable media and therefore
must be always mount(1)ed. The option tells eject to not try
to unmount the given device, even if it is mounted according
to /etc/mtab or /proc/mounts.</p>

<p>-V This option causes eject to display the program
version and exit.</p>

<p>LONG OPTIONS All options have corresponding long names,
as listed below. The long names can be abbreviated as long
as they are unique.</p>

<p>-h --help -v --verbose -d --default -a --auto -c
--changerslot -t --trayclose -T --traytoggle -x --cdspeed -X
--listspeed -n --noop -r --cdrom -s --scsi -f --floppy -q
--tape -V --version -p --proc -m --no-unmount</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Eject the default device:</p>

<p>eject</p>

<p>Eject a device or mount point named cdrom:</p>

<p>eject cdrom</p>

<p>Eject using device name:</p>

<p>eject /dev/cdrom</p>

<p>Eject using mount point:</p>

<p>eject /mnt/cdrom/</p>

<p>Eject 4th IDE device:</p>

<p>eject hdd</p>

<p>Eject first SCSI device:</p>

<p>eject sda</p>

<p>Eject using SCSI partition name (e.g. a ZIP drive):</p>

<p>eject sda4</p>

<p>Select 5th disc on multi-disc changer:</p>

<p>eject -v -c4 /dev/cdrom</p>

<p>Turn on auto-eject on a SoundBlaster CD-ROM drive:</p>

<p>eject -a on /dev/sbpcd</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS Returns 0 if operation was successful, 1 if
operation failed or command syntax was not valid.</p>

<p>NOTES Eject only works with devices that support one or
more of the four methods of ejecting. This includes most
CD-ROM drives (IDE, SCSI, and proprietary), some SCSI tape
drives, JAZ drives, ZIP drives (parallel port, SCSI, and IDE
versions), and LS120 removable floppies. Users have also
reported success with floppy drives on Sun SPARC and Apple
Macin- tosh systems. If eject does not work, it is most
likely a limitation of the kernel driver for the device and
not the eject program itself.</p>

<p>The -r, -s, -f, and -q options allow controlling which
methods are used to eject. More than one method can be
specified. If none of these options are specified, it tries
all four (this works fine in most cases).</p>

<p>Eject may not always be able to determine if the device
is mounted (e.g. if it has several names). If the device
name is a symbolic link, eject will follow the link and use
the device that it points to.</p>

<p>If eject determines that the device can have multiple
partitions, it will attempt to unmount all mounted
partitions of the device before ejecting. If an unmount
fails, the program will not attempt to eject the media.</p>

<p>You can eject an audio CD. Some CD-ROM drives will
refuse to open the tray if the drive is empty. Some devices
do not support the tray close command.</p>

<p>If the auto-eject feature is enabled, then the drive
will always be ejected after running this command. Not all
Linux kernel CD-ROM drivers support the auto-eject mode.
There is no way to find out the state of the auto-eject
mode.</p>

<p>You need appropriate privileges to access the device
files. Running as root or setuid root is required to eject
some devices (e.g. SCSI devices).</p>

<p>The heuristic used to find a device, given a name, is as
follows. If the name ends in a trailing slash, it is removed
(this is to support filenames generated using shell file
name completion). If the name starts with . or /, it tries
to open it as a device file or mount point. If that fails,
it tries prepending /dev/, /media/ ,/mnt/, /dev/cdroms ,
/dev/rdsk/, /dev/dsk/, and finally ./ to the name, until a
device file or mount point is found that can be opened. The
program checks /etc/mtab for mounted devices. If that fails,
it also checks /etc/fstab for mount points of currently
unmounted devices.</p>

<p>Creating symbolic links such as /dev/cdrom or /dev/zip
is recommended so that eject can determine the appropriate
devices using easily remem- bered names.</p>

<p>To save typing you can create a shell alias for the
eject options that work for your particular setup.</p>
