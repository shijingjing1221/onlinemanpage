<p>NAMESPACE.CONF(5) Linux-PAM Manual NAMESPACE.CONF(5)</p>

<p>NAME namespace.conf - the namespace configuration
file</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pam_namespace.so module allows setup of
private namespaces with polyinstantiated directories.
Directories can be polyinstantiated based on user name or,
in the case of SELinux, user name, sensitivity level or
complete security context. If an executable script
/etc/security/namespace.init exists, it is used to
initialize the namespace every time an instance directory is
set up and mounted. The script receives the polyinstantiated
directory path and the instance directory path as its
arguments.</p>

<p>The /etc/security/namespace.conf file specifies which
directories are polyinstantiated, how they are
polyinstantiated, how instance directories would be named,
and any users for whom polyinstantiation would not be
performed.</p>

<p>When someone logs in, the file namespace.conf is
scanned. Comments are marked by # characters. Each non
comment line represents one polyinstantiated directory. The
fields are separated by spaces but can be quoted by &quot;
characters also escape sequences b, n, and t are recognized.
The fields are as follows:</p>

<p>polydir instance_prefix method list_of_uids</p>

<p>The first field, polydir, is the absolute pathname of
the directory to polyinstantiate. The special string $HOME
is replaced with the user&acute;s home directory, and $USER
with the username. This field cannot be blank.</p>

<p>The second field, instance_prefix is the string prefix
used to build the pathname for the instantiation of
&lt;polydir&gt;. Depending on the polyinstantiation method
it is then appended with &quot;instance differentiation
string&quot; to generate the final instance directory path.
This directory is created if it did not exist already, and
is then bind mounted on the &lt;polydir&gt; to provide an
instance of &lt;polydir&gt; based on the &lt;method&gt;
column. The special string $HOME is replaced with the
user&acute;s home directory, and $USER with the username.
This field cannot be blank.</p>

<p>The third field, method, is the method used for
polyinstantiation. It can take these values;
&quot;user&quot; for polyinstantiation based on user name,
&quot;level&quot; for polyinstantiation based on process MLS
level and user name, &quot;context&quot; for
polyinstantiation based on process security context and user
name, &quot;tmpfs&quot; for mounting tmpfs filesystem as an
instance dir, and &quot;tmpdir&quot; for creating temporary
directory as an instance dir which is removed when the
user&acute;s session is closed. Methods &quot;context&quot;
and &quot;level&quot; are only available with SELinux. This
field cannot be blank.</p>

<p>The fourth field, list_of_uids, is a comma separated
list of user names for whom the polyinstantiation is not
performed. If left blank, polyinstantiation will be
performed for all users. If the list is preceded with a
single &quot;~&quot; character, polyinstantiation is
performed only for users in the list.</p>

<p>The method field can contain also following optional
flags separated by : characters.</p>

<p>create=mode,owner,group - create the polyinstantiated
directory. The mode, owner and group parameters are
optional. The default for mode is determined by umask, the
default owner is the user whose session is opened, the
default group is the primary group of the user.</p>

<p>iscript=path - path to the instance directory init
script. The base directory for relative paths is
/etc/security/namespace.d.</p>

<p>noinit - instance directory init script will not be
executed.</p>

<p>shared - the instance directories for
&quot;context&quot; and &quot;level&quot; methods will not
contain the user name and will be shared among all
users.</p>

<p>The directory where polyinstantiated instances are to be
created, must exist and must have, by default, the mode of
0000. The requirement that the instance parent be of mode
0000 can be overridden with the command line option
ignore_instance_parent_mode</p>

<p>In case of context or level polyinstantiation the
SELinux context which is used for polyinstantiation is the
context used for executing a new process as obtained by
getexeccon. This context must be set by the calling
application or pam_selinux.so module. If this context is not
set the polyinstatiation will be based just on user
name.</p>

<p>The &quot;instance differentiation string&quot; is
&lt;user name&gt; for &quot;user&quot; method and &lt;user
name&gt;_&lt;raw directory context&gt; for
&quot;context&quot; and &quot;level&quot; methods. If the
whole string is too long the end of it is replaced with
md5sum of itself. Also when command line option gen_hash is
used the whole string is replaced with md5sum of itself.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES These are some example lines which might be
specified in /etc/security/namespace.conf.</p>

<p># The following three lines will polyinstantiate /tmp, #
/var/tmp and user&acute;s home directories. /tmp and
/var/tmp # will be polyinstantiated based on the security
level # as well as user name, whereas home directory will be
# polyinstantiated based on the full security context and
user name. # Polyinstantiation will not be performed for
user root # and adm for directories /tmp and /var/tmp,
whereas home # directories will be polyinstantiated for all
users. # # Note that instance directories do not have to
reside inside # the polyinstantiated directory. In the
examples below, # instances of /tmp will be created in
/tmp-inst directory, # where as instances of /var/tmp and
users home directories # will reside within the directories
that are being # polyinstantiated. # /tmp /tmp-inst/ level
root,adm /var/tmp /var/tmp/tmp-inst/ level root,adm $HOME
$HOME/$USER.inst/inst- context</p>

<p>For the &lt;service&gt;s you need polyinstantiation
(login for example) put the following line in
/etc/pam.d/&lt;service&gt; as the last line for session
group:</p>

<p>session required pam_namespace.so [arguments]</p>

<p>This module also depends on pam_selinux.so setting the
context.</p>
