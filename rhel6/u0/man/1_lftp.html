<p>NAME lftp - Sophisticated file transfer program</p>

<p>SYNTAX lftp [-d] [-e cmd] [-p port] [-u user[,pass]]
[site] lftp -f script_file lftp -c commands lftp --version
lftp --help</p>

<p>VERSION This man page documents lftp version 4.0.9.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION lftp is a file transfer program that allows
sophisticated ftp, http and other connections to other
hosts. If site is specified then lftp will connect to that
site otherwise a connection has to be established with the
open command.</p>

<p>lftp can handle several file access methods - ftp, ftps,
http, https, hftp, fish, sftp and file (https and ftps are
only available when lftp is compiled with GNU TLS or OpenSSL
library). You can specify the method to use in open URL
command, e.g. open http://www.us.ker- nel.org/pub/linux .
hftp is ftp-over-http-proxy protocol. It can be used
automatically instead of ftp if ftp:proxy is set to
http://proxy[:port] . Fish is a protocol working over an ssh
connec- tion to a unix account. SFtp is a protocol
implemented in ssh2 as sftp subsystem.</p>

<p>Besides FTP-like protocols, lftp has support for
BitTorrent protocol as torrent command. Seeding is also
supported.</p>

<p>Every operation in lftp is reliable, that is any not
fatal error is ignored and the operation is repeated. So if
downloading breaks, it will be restarted from the point
automatically. Even if ftp server does not support REST
command, lftp will try to retrieve the file from the very
beginning until the file is transferred completely.</p>

<p>lftp has shell-like command syntax allowing you to
launch several com- mands in parallel in background (&amp;).
It is also possible to group com- mands within () and
execute them in background. All background jobs are executed
in the same single process. You can bring a foreground job
to background with ^Z (c-z) and back with command wait (or
fg which is alias to wait). To list running jobs, use
command jobs. Some com- mands allow redirecting their output
(cat, ls, ...) to file or via pipe to external command.
Commands can be executed conditionally based on termination
status of previous command (&amp;&amp;, ||).</p>

<p>If you exit lftp when some jobs are not finished yet,
lftp will move itself to nohup mode in background. The same
happens when you have a real modem hangup or when you close
an xterm.</p>

<p>lftp has builtin mirror which can download or update a
whole directory tree. There is also reverse mirror (mirror
-R) which uploads or updates a directory tree on server.
Mirror can also synchronize directories between two remote
servers, using FXP if available.</p>

<p>There is command at to launch a job at specified time in
current con- text, command queue to queue commands for
sequential execution for current server, and much more.</p>

<p>On startup, lftp executes /etc/lftp.conf and then
~/.lftprc and ~/.lftp/rc. You can place aliases and set
commands there. Some people prefer to see full protocol
debug, use debug to turn the debug on. Use debug 3 to see
only greeting messages and error messages.</p>

<p>lftp has a number of settable variables. You can use set
-a to see all variables and their values or set -d to see
list of defaults. Variable names can be abbreviated and
prefix can be omitted unless the rest becomes ambiguous.</p>

<p>If lftp was compiled with OpenSSL (configure
--with-openssl), then it includes software developed by the
OpenSSL Project for use in the OpenSSL Toolkit.
(http://www.openssl.org/)</p>

<p>Commands ! shell command</p>

<p>Launch shell or shell command.</p>

<p>!ls</p>

<p>To do a directory listing of the local host.</p>

<p>alias [name [value]]</p>

<p>Define or undefine alias name. If value is omitted, the
alias is unde- fined, else it takes the value value. If no
argument is given the cur- rent aliases are listed.</p>

<p>alias dir ls -lF alias less zmore</p>

<p>anon</p>

<p>Sets the user to anonymous. This is the default.</p>

<p>at time [ -- command ]</p>

<p>Wait until the given time and execute given (optional)
command. See also at(1).</p>

<p>bookmark [subcommand]</p>

<p>The bookmark command controls bookmarks. add
&lt;name&gt; [&lt;loc&gt;] add current place or given
location to bookmarks and bind to given name del
&lt;name&gt; remove bookmark with name edit start editor on
bookmarks file import &lt;type&gt; import foreign bookmarks
list list bookmarks (default)</p>

<p>cache [subcommand]</p>

<p>The cache command controls local memory cache. The
following subcom- mands are recognized: stat print cache
status (default) on|off turn on/off caching flush flush
cache size lim set memory limit, -1 means unlimited expire
Nx set cache expiration time to N seconds (x=s) minutes
(x=m) hours (x=h) or days (x=d)</p>

<p>cat files</p>

<p>cat outputs the remote file(s) to stdout. (See also
more, zcat and zmore)</p>

<p>cd rdir</p>

<p>Change current remote directory. The previous remote
directory is stored as -. You can do cd - to change the
directory back. The previous directory for each site is also
stored on disk, so you can do open site; cd - even after
lftp restart.</p>

<p>chmod mode files</p>

<p>Change permission mask on remote files. The mode must be
an octal num- ber.</p>

<p>close [-a]</p>

<p>Close idle connections. By default only with the current
server, use -a to close all idle connections.</p>

<p>cls [OPTS] files...</p>

<p>cls tries to retrieve information about specified files
or directo- ries and outputs the information according to
format options. The dif- ference between ls and cls is that
ls requests the server to for- mat file listing, and cls
formats it itself, after retrieving all the needed
information. See help cls for options.</p>

<p>command cmd args...</p>

<p>execute given command ignoring aliases.</p>

<p>debug [-o file] level|off</p>

<p>Switch debugging to level or turn it off. Use -o to
redirect the debug output to a file.</p>

<p>echo [-n] string</p>

<p>guess what it does.</p>

<p>eval [-f format ] args...</p>

<p>without -f it just executes given arguments as a
command. With -f, arguments are transformed into a new
command. The format can contain plain text and placeholders
$0...$9 and $@, corresponding to the argu- ments.</p>

<p>exit [bg] [top] [kill] [code]</p>

<p>exit will exit from lftp or move to background if there
are active jobs. If no job is active, code is passed to
operating system as lftps termination status. If code is
omitted, the exit code of last command is used.</p>

<p>exit bg forces moving to background when
cmd:move-background is false. exit top makes top level shell
(internal lftp command executor) terminate. exit kill kills
all numbered jobs before exit- ing. The options can be
combined, e.g. at 08:00 -- exit top kill &amp; kills all
jobs and makes lftp exit at specified time.</p>

<p>fg</p>

<p>Alias for wait.</p>

<p>find [directory]</p>

<p>List files in the directory (current directory by
default) recursively. This can help with servers lacking ls
-R support. You can redirect out- put of this command.</p>

<p>ftpcopy</p>

<p>Obsolete. Use one of the following instead: get
ftp://... -o ftp://... get -O ftp://... file1 file2... put
ftp://... mput ftp://.../* mget -O ftp://... ftp://.../* or
other combinations to get FXP transfer (directly between two
ftp servers). lftp would fallback to plain copy (via client)
if FXP trans- fer cannot be initiated or ftp:use-fxp is
false.</p>

<p>get [-E] [-a] [-c] [-O base] rfile [-o lfile] ...</p>

<p>Retrieve the remote file rfile and store it as the local
file lfile. If -o is omitted, the file is stored to local
file named as base name of rfile. You can get multiple files
by specifying multiple instances of rfile (and -o lfile).
Does not expand wildcards, use mget for that. -c continue,
reget -E delete source files after successful transfer -a
use ascii mode (binary is the default) -O &lt;base&gt;
specifies base directory or URL where files should be
placed</p>

<p>Examples: get README get README -o debian.README get
README README.mirrors get README -o debian.README
README.mirrors -o debian.mirrors get README -o
ftp://some.host.org/debian.README get README -o
ftp://some.host.org/debian-dir/ (end slash is important)</p>

<p>get1 [OPTS] rfile</p>

<p>Transfer a single file. Options: -o &lt;lfile&gt;
destination file name (default - basename of rfile) -c
continue, reget -E delete source files after successful
transfer -a use ascii mode (binary is the default)
--source-region=&lt;from-to&gt; transfer specified region of
source file --target-position=&lt;pos&gt; position in target
file to write data at</p>

<p>glob [-d] [-a] [-f] command patterns</p>

<p>Glob given patterns containing metacharacters and pass
result to given command. E.g. glob echo *. -f plain files
(default) -d directories -a all types</p>

<p>help [cmd]</p>

<p>Print help for cmd or if no cmd was specified print a
list of available commands.</p>

<p>jobs [-v]</p>

<p>List running jobs. -v means verbose, several -v can be
specified.</p>

<p>kill all|job_no</p>

<p>Delete specified job with job_no or all jobs. (For
job_no see jobs)</p>

<p>lcd ldir</p>

<p>Change current local directory ldir. The previous local
directory is stored as -. You can do lcd - to change the
directory back.</p>

<p>lpwd</p>

<p>Print current working directory on local machine.</p>

<p>ls params</p>

<p>List remote files. You can redirect output of this
command to file or via pipe to external command. By default,
ls output is cached, to see new listing use rels or cache
flush.</p>

<p>mget [-c] [-d] [-a] [-E] [-O base] files</p>

<p>Gets selected files with expanded wildcards.</p>

<p>-c continue, reget. -d create directories the same as
file names and get the files into them instead of current
directory. -E delete source files after successful transfer
-a use ascii mode (binary is the default) -O &lt;base&gt;
specifies base directory or URL where files should be
placed</p>

<p>mirror [OPTS] [source [target]]</p>

<p>Mirror specified source directory to local target
directory. If target directory ends with a slash, the source
base name is appended to target directory name. Source
and/or target can be URLs pointing to directo- ries.</p>

<p>-c, --continue continue a mirror job if possible -e,
--delete delete files not present at remote site
--delete-first delete old files before transferring new ones
--depth-first descend into subdirectories before
transferring files -s, --allow-suid set suid/sgid bits
according to remote site --allow-chown try to set owner and
group on files --ascii use ascii mode transfers (implies
--ignore-size) --ignore-time ignore time when deciding
whether to download --ignore-size ignore size when deciding
whether to download --only-missing download only missing
files --only-existing download only files already existing
at target -n, --only-newer download only newer files (-c won
t work) --no-empty-dirs don t create empty directories
(implies --depth-first) -r, --no-recursion dont go to
subdirectories --no-symlinks dont create symbolic links -p,
--no-perms dont set file permissions --no-umask dont apply
umask to file modes -R, --reverse reverse mirror (put files)
-L, --dereference download symbolic links as files -N,
--newer-than=SPEC download only files newer than specified
time --on-change=CMD execute the command if anything has
been changed --older-than=SPEC download only files older
than specified time --size-range=RANGE download only files
with size in specified range -P, --parallel[=N] download N
files in parallel --use-pget[-n=N] use pget to transfer
every single file --loop loop until no changes found -i RX,
--include RX include matching files -x RX, --exclude RX
exclude matching files -I GP, --include-glob GP include
matching files -X GP, --exclude-glob GP exclude matching
files -v, --verbose[=level] verbose operation --log=FILE
write lftp commands being executed to FILE --script=FILE
write lftp commands to FILE, but dont execute them
--just-print, --dry-run same as --script=- --use-cache use
cached directory listings --Remove-source-files remove files
after transfer (use with caution) -a same as --allow-chown
--allow-suid --no-umask</p>

<p>When using -R, the first directory is local and the
second is remote. If the second directory is omitted, base
name of first directory is used. If both directories are
omitted, current local and remote direc- tories are used. If
target directory ends with a slash (except root directory)
then base name of source directory is appended.</p>

<p>RX is an extended regular expression, just like in
egrep(1).</p>

<p>GP is a glob pattern, e.g. *.zip.</p>

<p>Include and exclude options can be specified multiple
times. It means that a file or directory would be mirrored
if it matches an include and does not match to excludes
after the include, or does not match any- thing and the
first check is exclude. Directories are matched with a slash
appended.</p>

<p>Note that symbolic links are not created when uploading
to remote server, because ftp protocol cannot do it. To
upload files the links refer to, use mirror -RL command
(treat symbolic links as files).</p>

<p>For option --newer-than you can either specify a file or
time specifi- cation like that used by at(1) command, e.g.
now-7days or week ago. If you specify a file, then
modification time of that file will be used.</p>

<p>Verbosity level can be selected using --verbose=level
option or by sev- eral -v options, e.g. -vvv. Levels are: 0
- no output (default) 1 - print actions 2 - +print not
deleted file names (when -e is not specified) 3 - +print
directory names which are mirrored</p>

<p>--only-newer turns off file size comparison and
uploads/downloads only newer files even if size is
different. By default older files are transferred and
replace newer ones.</p>

<p>You can mirror between two servers if you specify URLs
instead of directories. FXP is used automatically for
transfers between ftp servers, if possible.</p>

<p>Some ftp servers hide dot-files by default (e.g.
.htaccess), and show them only when LIST command is used
with -a option. In such case try to use set ftp:list-options
-a.</p>

<p>mkdir [-p] dir(s)</p>

<p>Make remote directories. If -p is used, make all
components of paths.</p>

<p>module module [ args ]</p>

<p>Load given module using dlopen(3) function. If module
name does not contain a slash, it is searched in directories
specified by module:path variable. Arguments are passed to
module_init function. See README.modules for technical
details.</p>

<p>more files</p>

<p>Same as cat files | more. if PAGER is set, it is used as
filter. (See also cat, zcat and zmore)</p>

<p>mput [-c] [-d] [-a] [-E] [-O base] files</p>

<p>Upload files with wildcard expansion. By default it uses
the base name of local name as remote one. This can be
changed by -d option. -c continue, reput -d create
directories the same as in file names and put the files into
them instead of current directory -E delete source files
after successful transfer (dangerous) -a use ascii mode
(binary is the default) -O &lt;base&gt; specifies base
directory or URL where files should be placed</p>

<p>mrm file(s)</p>

<p>Same as glob rm. Removes specified file(s) with wildcard
expansion.</p>

<p>mv file1 file2</p>

<p>Rename file1 to file2.</p>

<p>nlist [args]</p>

<p>List remote file names</p>

<p>open [-e cmd] [-u user[,pass]] [-p port] host|url</p>

<p>Select an ftp server.</p>

<p>pget [OPTS] rfile [-o lfile]</p>

<p>Gets the specified file using several connections. This
can speed up transfer, but loads the net and server heavily
impacting other users. Use only if you really have to
transfer the file ASAP. Options: -c continue transfer.
Requires lfile.lftp-pget-status file. -n maxconn set maximum
number of connections (default is taken from pget:default-n
setting)</p>

<p>put [-E] [-a] [-c] [-O base] lfile [-o rfile]</p>

<p>Upload lfile with remote name rfile. If -o omitted, the
base name of lfile is used as remote name. Does not expand
wildcards, use mput for that. -o &lt;rfile&gt; specifies
remote file name (default - basename of lfile) -c continue,
reput it requires permission to overwrite remote files -E
delete source files after successful transfer (dangerous) -a
use ascii mode (binary is the default) -O &lt;base&gt;
specifies base directory or URL where files should be
placed</p>

<p>pwd [-p]</p>

<p>Print current remote URL. Use -p option to show password
in the URL.</p>

<p>queue [-n num ] cmd</p>

<p>Add the given command to queue for sequential execution.
Each site has its own queue. -n adds the command before the
given item in the queue. Dont try to queue cd or lcd
commands, it may confuse lftp. Instead do the cd/lcd before
queue command, and it will remember the place in which the
command is to be done. It is possible to queue up an already
running job by queue wait &lt;jobno&gt;, but the job will
continue execution even if it is not the first in queue.</p>

<p>queue stop will stop the queue, it will not execute any
new commands, but already running jobs will continue to run.
You can use queue stop to create an empty stopped queue.
queue start will resume queue exe- cution. When you exit
lftp, it will start all stopped queues automati- cally.</p>

<p>queue with no arguments will either create a stopped
queue or print queue status.</p>

<p>queue --delete|-d [index or wildcard expression]</p>

<p>Delete one or more items from the queue. If no argument
is given, the last entry in the queue is deleted.</p>

<p>queue --move|-m &lt;index or wildcard expression&gt;
[index]</p>

<p>Move the given items before the given queue index, or to
the end if no destination is given.</p>

<p>-q Be quiet. -v Be verbose. -Q Output in a format that
can be used to re-queue. Useful with --delete.</p>

<p>&gt; get file &amp; [1] get file &gt; queue wait 1 &gt;
queue get another_file &gt; cd a_directory &gt; queue get
yet_another_file</p>

<p>queue -d 3 Delete the third item in the queue. queue -m
6 4 Move the sixth item in the queue before the fourth.
queue -m &quot;get*zip&quot; 1 Move all commands matching
&quot;get*zip&quot; to the beginning of the queue. (The
order of the items is preserved.) queue -d
&quot;get*zip&quot; Delete all commands matching
&quot;get*zip&quot;.</p>

<p>quote cmd</p>

<p>For FTP - send the command uninterpreted. Use with
caution - it can lead to unknown remote state and thus will
cause reconnect. You cannot be sure that any change of
remote state because of quoted command is solid - it can be
reset by reconnect at any time.</p>

<p>For HTTP - specific to HTTP action. Syntax: quote
&lt;command&gt; [&lt;args&gt;]. Command may be set-cookie or
post. open http://www.site.net quote set-cookie
&quot;variable=value; othervar=othervalue&quot; set
http:post-content-type application/x-www-form-urlencoded
quote post /cgi-bin/script.cgi
&quot;var=value&amp;othervar=othervalue&quot; &gt;
local_file</p>

<p>For FISH - send the command uninterpreted. This can be
used to execute arbitrary commands on server. The command
must not take input or print ### at new line beginning. If
it does, the protocol will become out of sync. open
fish://server quote find -name zip</p>

<p>reget rfile [-o lfile]</p>

<p>Same as get -c.</p>

<p>rels [args]</p>

<p>Same as ls, but ignores the cache.</p>

<p>renlist [args]</p>

<p>Same as nlist, but ignores the cache.</p>

<p>repeat [OPTS] [[-d] delay] [command]</p>

<p>Repeat specified command with a delay between
iterations. Default delay is one second, default command is
empty.</p>

<p>-c &lt;count&gt; maximum number of iterations -d
&lt;delay&gt; delay between iterations --while-ok stop when
command exits with non-zero code --until-ok stop when
command exits with zero code --weak stop when lftp moves to
background.</p>

<p>Examples: repeat at tomorrow -- mirror repeat 1d
mirror</p>

<p>reput lfile [-o rfile]</p>

<p>Same as put -c.</p>

<p>rm [-r] [-f] files</p>

<p>Remove remote files. Does not expand wildcards, use mrm
for that. -r is for recursive directory remove. Be careful,
if something goes wrong you can lose files. -f suppress
error messages.</p>

<p>rmdir dir(s)</p>

<p>Remove remote directories.</p>

<p>scache [session]</p>

<p>List cached sessions or switch to specified session.</p>

<p>set [var [val]]</p>

<p>Set variable to given value. If the value is omitted,
unset the vari- able. Variable name has format name/closure,
where closure can specify exact application of the setting.
See below for details. If set is called with no variable
then only altered settings are listed. It can be changed by
options:</p>

<p>-a list all settings, including default values -d list
only default values, not necessary current ones</p>

<p>site site_cmd</p>

<p>Execute site command site_cmd and output the result. You
can redirect its output.</p>

<p>sleep interval</p>

<p>Sleep given time interval and exit. Interval is in
seconds by default, but can be suffixed with m, h, d for
minutes, hours and days respectively. See also at.</p>

<p>slot [name]</p>

<p>Select specified slot or list all slots allocated. A
slot is a connec- tion to a server, somewhat like a virtual
console. You can create mul- tiple slots connected to
different servers and switch between them. You can also use
slot:name as a pseudo-URL evaluating to that slot
location.</p>

<p>Default readline binding allows quick switching between
slots named 0-9 using Meta-0 - Meta-9 keys (often you can
use Alt instead of Meta).</p>

<p>source file source -e command</p>

<p>Execute commands recorded in file file or returned by
specified exter- nal command. source ~/.lftp/rc source -e
echo help</p>

<p>suspend</p>

<p>Stop lftp process. Note that transfers will be also
stopped until you continue the process with shells fg or bg
commands.</p>

<p>torrent torrent-file [-O directory]</p>

<p>Start BitTorrent process for the given torrent-file,
which can be a local file or URL. Existing files are first
validated. Missing pieces are downloaded. Files are stored
in specified directory or current working directory by
default. Seeding continues until ratio reachs tor-
rent:stop-on-ratio setting or time of torrent:seed-max-time
outs.</p>

<p>user user [pass] user URL [pass]</p>

<p>Use specified info for remote login. If you specify an
URL with user name, the entered password will be cached so
that future URL references can use it.</p>

<p>version</p>

<p>Print lftp version.</p>

<p>wait [jobno] wait all</p>

<p>Wait for specified job to terminate. If jobno is
omitted, wait for last backgrounded job.</p>

<p>wait all waits for all jobs termination.</p>

<p>zcat files</p>

<p>Same as cat, but filter each file through zcat. (See
also cat, more and zmore)</p>

<p>zmore files</p>

<p>Same as more, but filter each file through zcat. (See
also cat, zcat and more)</p>

<p>Settings On startup, lftp executes ~/.lftprc and
~/.lftp/rc. You can place aliases and set commands there.
Some people prefer to see full proto- col debug, use debug
to turn the debug on.</p>

<p>There is also a system-wide startup file in
/etc/lftp.conf. It can be in different directory, see FILES
section.</p>

<p>lftp has the following settable variables (you can also
use set -a to see all variables and their values):</p>

<p>bmk:save-passwords (boolean) save plain text passwords
in ~/.lftp/bookmarks on bookmark add command. Off by
default.</p>

<p>cmd:at-exit (string) the commands in string are executed
before lftp exits.</p>

<p>cmd:csh-history (boolean) enables csh-like history
expansion.</p>

<p>cmd:default-protocol (string) The value is used when
open is used with just host name with- out protocol. Default
is ftp.</p>

<p>cmd:fail-exit (boolean) if true, exit when an
unconditional (without || and &amp;&amp; at begin) command
fails.</p>

<p>cmd:long-running (seconds) time of command execution,
which is considered as long and a beep is done before next
prompt. 0 means off.</p>

<p>cmd:ls-default (string) default ls argument</p>

<p>cmd:move-background (boolean) when false, lftp refuses
to go to background when exiting. To force it, use exit
bg.</p>

<p>cmd:move-background-detach (boolean) when true
(default), lftp detaches itself from the control ter- minal
when moving to background, it is not possible to attach
back; when false, lftp tricks the shell to move lftp to
back- ground process group and continues to run, then fg
shell command brings lftp back to foreground unless it has
done all jobs and terminated.</p>

<p>cmd:prompt (string) The prompt. lftp recognizes the
following backslash-escaped spe- cial characters that are
decoded as follows:</p>

<p>@ insert @ if current user is not default a an ASCII
bell character (07) e an ASCII escape character (033) the
hostname you are connected to n newline the name of the
client (lftp) current slot name u the username of the user
you are logged in as U the URL of the remote site (e.g.,
ftp://g437.ub.gu.se/home/james/src/lftp) the version of lftp
(e.g., 2.0.3) 1296 W the base name of the current working
directory at the remote site nnn the character corresponding
to the octal number nnn \ a backslash [ begin a sequence of
non-printing characters, which could be used to embed a
terminal control sequence into the prompt ] end a sequence
of non-printing characters</p>

<p>cmd:parallel (number) Number of jobs run in parallel in
non-interactive mode. For example, this may be useful for
scripts with multiple get commands. Note that setting this
to a value greater than 1 changes conditional execution
behaviour, basically makes it inconsistent.</p>

<p>cmd:queue-parallel (number) Number of jobs run in
parallel in a queue.</p>

<p>cmd:time-style (string) This setting is the default
value for cls --time-style option.</p>

<p>cmd:trace (boolean) when true, lftp prints the commands
it executes (like sh -x).</p>

<p>cache:cache-empty-listings (boolean) When false, empty
listings are not cached.</p>

<p>cache:enable (boolean) When false, cache is
disabled.</p>

<p>cache:expire (time interval) Positive cache entries
expire in this time interval.</p>

<p>cache:expire-negative (time interval) Negative cache
entries expire in this time interval.</p>

<p>cache:size (number) Maximum cache size. When exceeded,
oldest cache entries will be removed from cache.</p>

<p>cmd:remote-completion (boolean) a boolean to control
whether or not lftp uses remote completion.</p>

<p>cmd:verify-host (boolean) if true, lftp resolves host
name immediately in open command. It is also possible to
skip the check for a single open com- mand if &amp; is
given, or if ^Z is pressed during the check.</p>

<p>cmd:verify-path (boolean) if true, lftp checks the path
given in cd command. It is also possible to skip the check
for a single cd command if &amp; is given, or if ^Z is
pressed during the check. Examples: set
cmd:verify-path/hftp://* false cd directory &amp;</p>

<p>cmd:verify-path-cached (boolean) When false, cd to a
directory known from cache as existent will succeed
immediately. Otherwise the verification will depend on
cmd:verify-path setting.</p>

<p>color:use-color (boolean) when true, cls command and
completion output colored file list- ings according to
color:dir-colors setting.</p>

<p>color:dir-colors (string) file listing color
description. By default the value of LS_COL- ORS environment
variable is used. See dircolors(1).</p>

<p>dns:SRV-query (boolean) query for SRV records and use
them before gethostbyname. The SRV records are only used if
port is not explicitly specified. See RFC2052 for
details.</p>

<p>dns:cache-enable (boolean) enable DNS cache. If it is
off, lftp resolves host name each time it reconnects.</p>

<p>dns:cache-expire (time interval) time to live for DNS
cache entries. It has format &lt;num- ber&gt;&lt;unit&gt;+,
e.g. 1d12h30m5s or just 36h. To disable expiration, set it
to inf or never.</p>

<p>dns:cache-size (number) maximum number of DNS cache
entries.</p>

<p>dns:fatal-timeout (time interval) limit the time for DNS
queries. If DNS server is unavailable too long, lftp will
fail to resolve a given host name. Set to never to
disable.</p>

<p>dns:order (list of protocol names) sets the order of DNS
queries. Default is inet6 inet which means first look up
address in inet6 family, then inet and use them in that
order. To disable inet6 (AAAA) lookup, set this variable to
inet.</p>

<p>dns:use-fork (boolean) if true, lftp will fork before
resolving host address. Default is true.</p>

<p>dns:max-retries (number) If zero, there is no limit on
the number of times lftp will try to lookup an address. If
&gt; 0, lftp will try only this number of times to look up
an address of each address family in dns:order.</p>

<p>file:charset (string) local character set. It is set
from current locale initially.</p>

<p>fish:charset (string) the character set used by fish
server in requests, replies and file listings. Default is
empty which means the same as local.</p>

<p>fish:connect-program (string) the program to use for
connecting to remote server. It should support -l option for
user name, -p for port number. Default is ssh -a -x. You can
set it to rsh, for example.</p>

<p>fish:shell (string) use specified shell on server side.
Default is /bin/sh. On some systems, /bin/sh exits when
doing cd to a non-existent direc- tory. lftp can handle that
but it has to reconnect. Set it to /bin/bash for such
systems if bash is installed.</p>

<p>ftp:acct (string) Send this string in ACCT command after
login. The result is ignored. The closure for this setting
has format user@host.</p>

<p>ftp:anon-pass (string) sets the password used for
anonymous ftp access authentication. Default is
&quot;-name@&quot;, where name is the username of the user
run- ning the program.</p>

<p>ftp:anon-user (string) sets the user name used for
anonymous ftp access authentication. Default is
&quot;anonymous&quot;.</p>

<p>ftp:auto-sync-mode (regex) if first server message
matches this regex, turn on sync mode for that host.</p>

<p>ftp:charset (string) the character set used by ftp
server in requests, replies and file listings. Default is
empty which means the same as local. This setting is only
used when the server does not support UTF8.</p>

<p>ftp:client (string) the name of ftp client to send with
CLNT command, if supported by server. If it is empty, then
no CLNT command will be sent.</p>

<p>ftp:bind-data-socket (boolean) bind data socket to the
interface of control connection (in pas- sive mode). Default
is true, exception is the loopback inter- face.</p>

<p>ftp:fix-pasv-address (boolean) if true, lftp will try to
correct address returned by server for PASV command in case
when server address is in public network and PASV returns an
address from a private network. In this case lftp would
substitute server address instead of the one returned by
PASV command, port number would not be changed. Default is
true.</p>

<p>ftp:fxp-passive-source (boolean) if true, lftp will try
to set up source ftp server in passive mode first, otherwise
destination one. If first attempt fails, lftp tries to set
them up the other way. If the other disposi- tion fails too,
lftp falls back to plain copy. See also ftp:use- fxp.</p>

<p>ftp:home (string) Initial directory. Default is empty
string which means auto. Set this to / if you dont like the
look of %2F in ftp URLs. The closure for this setting has
format user@host.</p>

<p>ftp:ignore-pasv-address (boolean) If true, lftp uses
control connection address instead of the one returned in
PASV reply for data connection. This can be useful for
broken NATs. Default is false.</p>

<p>ftp:list-empty-ok (boolean) if set to false, empty lists
from LIST command will be treated as incorrect, and another
method (NLST) will be used.</p>

<p>ftp:list-options (string) sets options which are always
appended to LIST command. It can be useful to set this to -a
if server does not show dot (hid- den) files by default.
Default is empty.</p>

<p>ftp:nop-interval (seconds) delay between NOOP commands
when downloading tail of a file. This is useful for ftp
servers which send &quot;Transfer complete&quot; message
before flushing data transfer. In such cases NOOP com- mands
can prevent connection timeout.</p>

<p>ftp:passive-mode (boolean) sets passive ftp mode. This
can be useful if you are behind a firewall or a dumb
masquerading router. In passive mode lftp uses PASV command,
not the PORT command which is used in active mode. In
passive mode lftp itself makes the data connection to the
server; in active mode the server connects to lftp for data
transfer. Passive mode is the default.</p>

<p>ftp:port-ipv4 (ipv4 address) specifies an IPv4 address
to send with PORT command. Default is empty which means to
send the address of local end of control connection.</p>

<p>ftp:port-range (from-to) allowed port range for active
mode. Format is min-max, or full or any to indicate any
port. Default is full.</p>

<p>ftp:prefer-epsv (boolean) use EPSV as preferred passive
mode. Default is false.</p>

<p>ftp:proxy (URL) specifies ftp proxy to use. To disable
proxy set this to empty string. Note that it is an ftp proxy
which uses ftp protocol, not ftp over http. Default value is
taken from environment variable ftp_proxy if it starts with
ftp://. If your ftp proxy requires authentication, specify
user name and password in the URL. If ftp:proxy starts with
http:// then hftp protocol (ftp over http proxy) is used
instead of ftp automatically.</p>

<p>ftp:proxy-auth-type (string) When set to joined , lftp
sends user@proxy_user@ftp.exam- ple.org as user name to
proxy, and password@proxy_password as password.</p>

<p>When set to joined-acct , lftp sends
user@ftp.example.org proxy_user (with space) as user name to
proxy. The site pass- word is sent as usual and the proxy
password is expected in the following ACCT command.</p>

<p>When set to open, lftp first sends proxy user and proxy
password and then OPEN ftp.example.org followed by USER
user. The site password is then sent as usual.</p>

<p>When set to user (default), lftp first sends proxy user
and proxy password and then user@ftp.example.org as user
name. The site password is then sent as usual.</p>

<p>When set to proxy-user@host , lftp first sends USER
proxy_user@ftp.example.org, then proxy password. The site
user and password are then sent as usual.</p>

<p>ftp:rest-list (boolean) allow usage of REST command
before LIST command. This might be useful for large
directories, but some ftp servers silently ignore REST
before LIST.</p>

<p>ftp:rest-stor (boolean) if false, lftp will not try to
use REST before STOR. This can be useful for some buggy
servers which corrupt (fill with zeros) the file if REST
followed by STOR is used.</p>

<p>ftp:retry-530 (regex) Retry on server reply 530 for PASS
command if text matches this regular expression. This
setting should be useful to distin- guish between overloaded
server (temporary condition) and incor- rect password
(permanent condition).</p>

<p>ftp:retry-530-anonymous (regex) Additional regular
expression for anonymous login, like ftp:retry-530.</p>

<p>ftp:site-group (string) Send this string in SITE GROUP
command after login. The result is ignored. The closure for
this setting has format user@host.</p>

<p>ftp:skey-allow (boolean) allow sending skey/opie reply
if server appears to support it. On by default.</p>

<p>ftp:skey-force (boolean) do not send plain text password
over the network, use skey/opie instead. If skey/opie is not
available, assume failed login. Off by default.</p>

<p>ftp:ssl-allow (boolean) if true, try to negotiate SSL
connection with ftp server for non-anonymous access. Default
is true. This and other ssl set- tings are only available if
lftp was compiled with an ssl/tls library.</p>

<p>ftp:ssl-data-use-keys (boolean) if true, lftp loads
ssl:key-file for protected data connection too. When false,
it does not, and the server can match data and control
connections by session ID. Default is true.</p>

<p>ftp:ssl-force (boolean) if true, refuse to send password
in clear when server does not support SSL. Default is
false.</p>

<p>ftp:ssl-protect-data (boolean) if true, request ssl
connection for data transfers. This is cpu- intensive but
provides privacy. Default is false.</p>

<p>ftp:ssl-protect-fxp (boolean) if true, request ssl
connection for data transfer between two ftp servers in FXP
mode. CPSV or SSCN command will be used in that case. If ssl
connection fails for some reason, lftp would try unprotected
FXP transfer unless ftp:ssl-force is set for any of the two
servers. Default is false.</p>

<p>ftp:ssl-protect-list (boolean) if true, request ssl
connection for file list transfers. Default is true.</p>

<p>ftp:ssl-use-ccc (boolean) if true, lftp would issue CCC
command after logon, thus disable ssl protection layer on
control connection.</p>

<p>ftp:stat-interval (time interval) interval between STAT
commands. Default is 1 second.</p>

<p>ftp:sync-mode (boolean) if true, lftp will send one
command at a time and wait for response. This might be
useful if you are using a buggy ftp server or router. When
it is off, lftp sends a pack of commands and waits for
responses - it speeds up operation when round trip time is
significant. Unfortunately it does not work with all ftp
servers and some routers have troubles with it, so it is on
by default.</p>

<p>ftp:timezone (string) Assume this timezone for time in
listings returned by LIST com- mand. This setting can be GMT
offset [+|-]HH[:MM[:SS]] or any valid TZ value (e.g.
Europe/Moscow or MSK-3MSD,M3.5.0,M10.5.0/3). The default is
GMT. Set it to an empty value to assume local timezone
specified by environment variable TZ.</p>

<p>ftp:trust-feat (string) When true, assume that FEAT
returned data are correct and dont use common protocol
extensions like SIZE, MDTM, REST if they are not listed.
Default is false.</p>

<p>ftp:use-abor (boolean) if false, lftp does not send ABOR
command but closes data con- nection immediately.</p>

<p>ftp:use-allo (boolean) when true (default), lftp sends
ALLO command before uploading a file.</p>

<p>ftp:use-feat (boolean) when true (default), lftp uses
FEAT command to determine extended features of ftp
server.</p>

<p>ftp:use-fxp (boolean) if true, lftp will try to set up
direct connection between two ftp servers.</p>

<p>ftp:use-hftp (boolean) when ftp:proxy points to an http
proxy, this setting selects hftp method (GET, HEAD) when
true, and CONNECT method when false. Default is true.</p>

<p>ftp:lang (boolean) the language selected with LANG
command, if supported as indi- cated by FEAT response.
Default is empty which means server default.</p>

<p>ftp:use-mdtm (boolean) when true (default), lftp uses
MDTM command to determine file modification time.</p>

<p>ftp:use-mdtm-overloaded (boolean) when true, lftp uses
two argument MDTM command to set file modi- fication time on
uploaded files. Default is false.</p>

<p>ftp:use-site-idle (boolean) when true, lftp sends SITE
IDLE command with net:idle argu- ment. Default is false.</p>

<p>ftp:use-site-utime (boolean) when true, lftp sends
5-argument SITE UTIME command to set file modification time
on uploaded files. Default is true.</p>

<p>ftp:use-site-utime2 (boolean) when true, lftp sends
2-argument SITE UTIME command to set file modification time
on uploaded files. Default is true. If 5-argument SITE UTIME
is also enabled, 2-argument command is tried first.</p>

<p>ftp:use-size (boolean) when true (default), lftp uses
SIZE command to determine file size.</p>

<p>ftp:use-stat (boolean) if true, lftp sends STAT command
in FXP mode transfer to know how much data has been
transferred. See also ftp:stat-interval. Default is
true.</p>

<p>ftp:use-stat-for-list (boolean) when true, lftp uses
STAT instead of LIST command. By default . is used as STAT
argument. Using STAT, lftp avoids creating data connection
for directory listing. Some servers require spe- cial
options for STAT, use ftp:list-options to specify them (e.g.
-la).</p>

<p>ftp:use-telnet-iac (boolean) when true (default), lftp
uses TELNET IAC command and follows TELNET protocol as
specified in RFC959. When false, it does not follow TELNET
protocol and thus does not double 255 (0xFF, 0377) character
and does not prefix ABOR and STAT commands with TELNET
IP+SYNCH signal.</p>

<p>ftp:use-quit (boolean) if true, lftp sends QUIT before
disconnecting from ftp server. Default is true.</p>

<p>ftp:verify-address (boolean) verify that data connection
comes from the network address of control connection peer.
This can possibly prevent data connec- tion spoofing which
can lead to data corruption. Unfortunately, this can fail
for certain ftp servers with several network interfaces,
when they do not set outgoing address on data socket, so it
is disabled by default.</p>

<p>ftp:verify-port (boolean) verify that data connection
has port 20 (ftp-data) on its remote end. This can possibly
prevent data connection spoofing by users of remote host.
Unfortunately, too many windows and even unix ftp servers
forget to set proper port on data connection, thus this
check is off by default.</p>

<p>ftp:web-mode (boolean) disconnect after closing data
connection. This can be useful for totally broken ftp
servers. Default is false.</p>

<p>ftps:initial-prot (string) specifies initial PROT
setting for FTPS connections. Should be one of: C, S, E, P,
or empty. Default is empty which means unknown, so that lftp
will use PROT command unconditionally. If PROT command turns
out to be unsupported, then Clear mode would be assumed.</p>

ftp-over-http protocol.</p>

<p>hftp:cache-control (string) specify corresponding HTTP
request header.</p>

<p>hftp:proxy (URL) specifies http proxy for ftp-over-http
protocol (hftp). The pro- tocol hftp cannot work without a
http proxy, obviously. Default value is taken from

otherwise from environment variable http_proxy. If your ftp
proxy requires authentication, specify user name and
password in the URL.</p>

<p>hftp:use-authorization (boolean) if set to off, lftp
will send password as part of URL to the proxy. This may be
required for some proxies (e.g. M-soft). Default is on, and
lftp will send password as part of Authoriza- tion
header.</p>

<p>hftp:use-head (boolean) if set to off, lftp will try to
use GET instead of HEAD for hftp protocol. While this is
slower, it may allow lftp to work with some proxies which
don t understand or mishandle HEAD ftp:// requests.</p>

<p>hftp:use-mkcol (boolean) if set to off, lftp will try to
use PUT instead of MKCOL to create directories with hftp
protocol. Default is off.</p>

<p>hftp:use-propfind (boolean) if set to off, lftp will not
try to use PROPFIND to get direc- tory contents with hftp
protocol and use GET instead. Default is off.</p>

<p>hftp:use-type (boolean) If set to off, lftp wont try to
append ;type= to URLs passed to proxy. Some broken proxies
dont handle it correctly. Default is on.</p>

Content-Type http request header for POST method. Default is
application/x-www-form-urlencoded.</p>

<p>http:proxy (URL) specifies http proxy. It is used when
lftp works over http pro- tocol. Default value is taken from
environment variable http_proxy. If your proxy requires
authentication, specify user name and password in the
URL.</p>

method to use on put.</p>

<p>http:put-content-type (string) specifies value of
Content-Type http request header for PUT method.</p>

<p>http:referer (string) specifies value for Referer http
request header. Single dot . expands to current directory
URL. Default is . . Set to empty string to disable Referer
header.</p>

<p>http:set-cookies (boolean) if true, lftp modifies
http:cookie variables when Set-Cookie header is
received.</p>

pattern. It is used just after mir- ror:exclude-regex is
applied. It is never used if mir- ror:exclude-regex is
empty.</p>

<p>mirror:order (list of patterns) specifies order of file
transfers. E.g. setting this to &quot;*.sfv *.sum&quot;
makes mirror to transfer files matching *.sfv first, then
ones matching *.sum and then all other files. To process
direc- tories after other files, add &quot;*/&quot; to end
of pattern list.</p>

limit-rate. 0 means twice of limit- rate.</p>

<p>net:limit-total-rate (bytes per second) limit transfer
rate of all connections in sum. 0 means unlim- ited. You can
specify two numbers separated by colon to limit download and
upload rate separately. Note that sockets have receive
buffers on them, this can lead to network link load higher
than this rate limit just after transfer beginning. You can
try to set net:socket-buffer to relatively small value to
avoid this.</p>

<p>net:limit-total-max (bytes) limit accumulating of unused
limit-total-rate. 0 means twice of limit-total-rate.</p>

minimal time between reconnects. Actual interval depends on
net:reconnect-interval-multiplier and number of attempts to
perform an operation.</p>

<p>net:reconnect-interval-max (seconds) sets maximum
reconnect interval. When current interval after
multiplication by net:reconnect-interval-multiplier reachs
this value (or exceeds it), it is reset back to
net:reconnect-inter- val-base.</p>

<p>net:reconnect-interval-multiplier (real number) sets
multiplier by which base interval is multiplied each time
new attempt to perform an operation fails. When the interval
reachs maximum, it is reset to base value. See
net:reconnect- interval-base and
net:reconnect-interval-max.</p>

<p>net:socket-bind-ipv4 (ipv4 address) bind all IPv4
sockets to specified address. This can be useful to select a
specific network interface to use. Default is empty which
means not to bind IPv4 sockets, operating system will choose
an address automatically using routing table.</p>

<p>net:socket-bind-ipv6 (ipv6 address) the same for IPv6
sockets.</p>

<p>net:socket-buffer (bytes) use given size for SO_SNDBUF
and SO_RCVBUF socket options. 0 means system default.</p>

negotiate. Default is 4. The actual pro- tocol version used
depends on server.</p>

<p>sftp:server-program (string) The server program
implementing SFTP protocol. If it does not contain a slash /
, it is considered a ssh2 subsystem and -s option is used
when starting connect-program. Default is sftp . You can use

average rate is calculated to produce ETA.</p>

<p>xfer:eta-terse (boolean) show terse ETA (only high order
parts). Default is true.</p>

<p>xfer:log (boolean) when true, lftp logs transfers to
~/.lftp/transfer_log.</p>

<p>xfer:max-redirections (number) maximum number of
redirections. This can be useful for download- ing over
HTTP. 0 prohibits redirections.</p>

<p>xfer:rate-period (seconds) the period over which
weighted average rate is calculated to be shown.</p>

<p>The name of a variable can be abbreviated unless it
becomes ambiguous. The prefix before : can be omitted too.
You can set one variable sev- eral times for different
closures, and thus you can get a particular settings for
particular state. The closure is to be specified after
variable name separated with slash /.</p>

<p>The closure for dns:, net:, ftp:, http:, hftp: domain
vari- ables is currently just the host name as you specify
it in the open command (with some exceptions where closure
is meaningless, e.g. dns:cache-size). For some cmd: domain
variables the closure is cur- rent URL without path. For
other variables it is not currently used. See examples in
the sample lftp.conf.</p>

<p>Certain commands and settings take a time interval
parameter. It has the format Nx[Nx...], where N is time
amount (floating point) and x is time unit: d - days, h -
hours, m - minutes, s - seconds. Default unit is second.
E.g. 5h30m or 5.5h. Also the interval can be infinity, inf ,
never, forever - it means infinite interval. E.g. sleep
forever or set dns:cache-expire never.</p>

<p>Boolean settings can be one of (true, on, yes, 1, +) for
a True value or one of (false, off, no, 0, -) for a False
value.</p>

<p>Integer settings can have a suffix: k - kibi, m - mebi,
g - gigi, etc. They can also have a prefix: 0 - octal, 0x -
hexadecimal.</p>

<p>FTP asynchronous mode (pipelining) Lftp can speed up ftp
operations by sending several commands at once and then
checking all the responses. See ftp:sync-mode variable.
Some- times this does not work, thus synchronous mode is the
default. You can try to turn synchronous mode off and see if
it works for you. It is known that some network software
dealing with address translation works incorrectly in the
case of several FTP commands in one network packet.</p>

<p>RFC959 says: The user-process sending another command
before the com- pletion reply would be in violation of
protocol; but server-FTP pro- cesses should queue any
commands that arrive while a preceding command is in
progress. Also, RFC1123 says: Implementors MUST NOT assume
any correspondence between READ boundaries on the control
connection and the Telnet EOL sequences (CR LF). and a
single READ from the control connection may include more
than one FTP command.</p>

<p>So it must be safe to send several commands at once,
which speeds up operation a lot and seems to work with all
Unix and VMS based ftp servers. Unfortunately, windows based
servers often cannot handle sev- eral commands in one
packet, and so cannot some broken routers.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -d Switch on debugging mode</p>

<p>-e commands Execute given commands and dont exit.</p>

<p>-p port Use the given port to connect</p>

<p>-u user[,pass] Use the given username and password to
connect</p>

<p>-f script_file Execute commands in the file and exit</p>

<p>-c commands Execute the given commands and exit.
Commands can be separated with a semicolon, &amp;&amp; or
||.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables are processed by lftp:</p>

<p>HOME Used for (local) tilde (~) expansion</p>

<p>SHELL Used by the ! command to determine the shell to
run.</p>

<p>PAGER This should be the name of the pager to use. Its
used by the more and zmore commands.</p>

<p>http_proxy, https_proxy Used to set initial http:proxy,
hftp:proxy and https:proxy vari- ables.</p>

<p>ftp_proxy Used to set initial ftp:proxy or hftp:proxy
variables, depending on URL protocol used in this
environment variable.</p>

<p>no_proxy Used to set initial net:no-proxy variable.</p>

<p>LFTP_MODULE_PATH Used to set initial module:path
variable.</p>

<p>LFTP_HOME Used to locate the directory that stores
user-specific configu- ration files. If unset, ~/.lftp will
be used.</p>

<p>LS_COLORS used to set initial color:dir-colors
variable.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/lftp.conf system-wide startup file. Actual
location depends on --sysconfdir configure option. It is
/etc when prefix is /usr, /usr/local/etc by default.</p>

<p>~/.lftp/rc, ~/.lftprc These files are executed on lftp
startup after /etc/lftp.conf.</p>

<p>~/.lftp/log The file things are logged to when lftp
moves into the back- ground in nohup mode.</p>

<p>~/.lftp/transfer_log The file transfers are logged to
when xfer:log setting is set to yes.</p>

<p>~/.lftp/bookmarks The file is used to store lftps
bookmarks. See the bookmark command.</p>

<p>~/.lftp/cwd_history The file is used to store last
working directories for each site visited.</p>

<p>~/.netrc The file is consulted to get default login and
password to ftp server. Passwords are also searched here if
an URL with user name but with no password is used.</p>
