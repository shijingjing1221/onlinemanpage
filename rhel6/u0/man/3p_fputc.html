<p>FPUTC(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual FPUTC(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME fputc - put a byte on a stream</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</p>

<p>int fputc(int c, FILE *stream);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The fputc() function shall write the byte
specified by c (converted to an unsigned char) to the output
stream pointed to by stream, at the position indicated by
the associated file-position indicator for the stream (if
defined), and shall advance the indicator appropriately. If
the file cannot support positioning requests, or if the
stream was opened with append mode, the byte shall be
appended to the output stream.</p>

<p>The st_ctime and st_mtime fields of the file shall be
marked for update between the successful execution of
fputc() and the next successful completion of a call to
fflush() or fclose() on the same stream or a call to exit()
or abort().</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, fputc() shall
return the value it has writ- ten. Otherwise, it shall
return EOF, the error indicator for the stream shall be set,
and errno shall be set to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The fputc() function shall fail if either the
stream is unbuffered or the streams buffer needs to be
flushed, and:</p>

<p>EAGAIN The O_NONBLOCK flag is set for the file
descriptor underlying stream and the process would be
delayed in the write operation.</p>

<p>EBADF The file descriptor underlying stream is not a
valid file descriptor open for writing.</p>

<p>EFBIG An attempt was made to write to a file that
exceeds the maximum file size.</p>

<p>EFBIG An attempt was made to write to a file that
exceeds the process file size limit.</p>

<p>EFBIG The file is a regular file and an attempt was made
to write at or beyond the offset maximum.</p>

<p>EINTR The write operation was terminated due to the
receipt of a sig- nal, and no data was transferred.</p>

<p>EIO A physical I/O error has occurred, or the process is
a member of a background process group attempting to write
to its control- ling terminal, TOSTOP is set, the process is
neither ignoring nor blocking SIGTTOU, and the process group
of the process is orphaned. This error may also be returned
under implementation- defined conditions.</p>

<p>ENOSPC There was no free space remaining on the device
containing the file.</p>

<p>EPIPE An attempt is made to write to a pipe or FIFO that
is not open for reading by any process. A SIGPIPE signal
shall also be sent to the thread.</p>

<p>The fputc() function may fail if:</p>

<p>ENOMEM Insufficient storage space is available.</p>

<p>ENXIO A request was made of a nonexistent device, or the
request was outside the capabilities of the device.</p>
