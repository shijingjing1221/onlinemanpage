<p>NAME TIFFReadRGBATile - read and decode an image tile
into a fixed-format raster</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tiffio.h&gt;</p>

<p>#define TIFFGetR(abgr) ((abgr) &amp; 0xff) #define
TIFFGetG(abgr) (((abgr) &gt;&gt; 8) &amp; 0xff) #define
TIFFGetB(abgr) (((abgr) &gt;&gt; 16) &amp; 0xff) #define
TIFFGetA(abgr) (((abgr) &gt;&gt; 24) &amp; 0xff)</p>

<p>int TIFFReadRGBATile(TIFF *tif, uint32 x, uint32 y,
uint32 *raster)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION TIFFReadRGBATile reads a single tile of a
tile-based image into memory, storing the result in the user
supplied RGBA raster. The raster is assumed to be an array
of width times length 32-bit entries, where width is the
width of a tile (TIFFTAG_TILEWIDTH) and length is the height
of a tile (TIFFTAG_TILELENGTH).</p>

<p>The x and y values are the offsets from the top left
corner to the top left corner of the tile to be read. They
must be an exact multiple of the tile width and length.</p>

<p>Note that the raster is assume to be organized such that
the pixel at location (x,y) is raster[y*width+x]; with the
raster origin in the lower-left hand corner of the tile.
That is bottom to top organization. Edge tiles which partly
fall off the image will be filled out with appropriate
zeroed areas.</p>

<p>Raster pixels are 8-bit packed red, green, blue, alpha
samples. The macros TIFFGetR, TIFFGetG, TIFFGetB, and
TIFFGetA should be used to access individual samples. Images
without Associated Alpha matting information have a constant
Alpha of 1.0 (255).</p>

<p>See the TIFFRGBAImage(3TIFF) page for more details on
how various image types are converted to RGBA values.</p>

<p>NOTES Samples must be either 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 bits.
Colorimetric sam- ples/pixel must be either 1, 3, or 4 (i.e.
SamplesPerPixel minus ExtraSamples).</p>

<p>Palette image colormaps that appear to be incorrectly
written as 8-bit values are automatically scaled to
16-bits.</p>

<p>TIFFReadRGBATile is just a wrapper around the more
general TIFFRGBAIm- age(3TIFF) facilities. It s main
advantage over the similar TIFFRead- RGBAImage() function is
that for large images a single buffer capable of holding the
whole image doesnt need to be allocated, only enough for one
tile. The TIFFReadRGBAStrip() function does a similar opera-
tion for stripped images.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUES 1 is returned if the image was
successfully read and converted. Other- wise, 0 is returned
if an error was encountered.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS All error messages are directed to the
TIFFError(3TIFF) routine.</p>

<p>Sorry, can not handle %d-bit pictures. The image had
BitsPerSample other than 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16.</p>

<p>Sorry, can not handle %d-channel images. The image had
SamplesPerPixel other than 1, 3, or 4.</p>

<p>Missing needed &quot;PhotometricInterpretation&quot;
tag. The image did not have a tag that describes how to
display the data.</p>

<p>No &quot;PhotometricInterpretation&quot; tag, assuming
RGB. The image was miss- ing a tag that describes how to
display it, but because it has 3 or 4 samples/pixel, it is
assumed to be RGB.</p>

<p>No &quot;PhotometricInterpretation&quot; tag, assuming
min-is-black. The image was missing a tag that describes how
to display it, but because it has 1 sample/pixel, it is
assumed to be a grayscale or bilevel image.</p>

<p>No space for photometric conversion table. There was
insufficient mem- ory for a table used to convert image
samples to 8-bit RGB.</p>

<p>Missing required &quot;Colormap&quot; tag. A Palette
image did not have a required Colormap tag.</p>

<p>No space for tile buffer. There was insufficient memory
to allocate an i/o buffer.</p>

<p>No space for strip buffer. There was insufficient memory
to allocate an i/o buffer.</p>

<p>Can not handle format. The image has a format
(combination of BitsPer- Sample, SamplesPerPixel, and
PhotometricInterpretation) that TIFFRead- RGBAImage can not
handle.</p>

<p>No space for B&amp;W mapping table. There was
insufficient memory to allo- cate a table used to map
grayscale data to RGB.</p>

<p>No space for Palette mapping table. There was
insufficient memory to allocate a table used to map data to
8-bit RGB.</p>
