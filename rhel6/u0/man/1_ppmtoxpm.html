<p>NAME ppmtoxpm - convert a PPM image to an X11 pixmap</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ppmtoxpm [-name=xpmname] [-hexonly]
[-rgb=rgb-textfile] [-alphamask=pgmfile] [ppmfile]</p>

<p>Minimum unique abbreviation of option is acceptable. You
may use dou- ble hyphens instead of single hyphen to denote
options. You may use white space in place of the equals sign
to separate an option name from its value.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>ppmtoxpm reads a PPM image as input and produces X11
pixmap (version 3) as output. This format can be loaded by
the XPM library.</p>

<p>In the XPM output, colors may be identified by name,
such as &quot;Red&quot;, or in hexadecimal, for example
&quot;#FF0000&quot;. In the hexadecimal format, there may be
from 1 through 4 hexadecimal digits per RGB component.</p>

<p>By default, ppmtoxpbm tries to find a name for each
color in the image in the system color dictionary , and if
it finds one, uses it. If it doesn t it uses hexadecimal.
You can force ppmtoxpbm to use hexadeci- mal only with the
-hexonly option. You can specify a different color
dictionary with the -rgb option.</p>

<p>When ppmtoxpm uses the hexadecimal format for
identifying a color, it uses the one that uses the least
number of hexadecimal digits that it takes to represent the
maxval of the input PPM. E.g. if the maxval of the input PPM
is 100, ppmtoxpm uses 2 digits per component, as in
&quot;#FF0000&quot;.</p>

<p>Some programs do not properly handle
one-digit-per-component hexadeci- mal color specifiers. They
see the wrong colors. To produce an XPM that such a program
can handle, make sure the maxval of the input PPM is greater
than 15, such as by running it through pamdepth 255.</p>

<p>Color Code Lengths - Image Size In the XPM format, there
is a palette (color map) that assigns each color in the
image to a unique sequence of printable characters called a
color code, and a raster that identifies the color of each
pixel of the image with one of those color codes. The length
of the color code affects the size of the image stream.</p>

<p>All color codes in an image are the same length, and
ppmtoxpm tries to make it as short as possible. That length
is, of course, determined by the number of colors in the
image. ppmtoxpm counts the colors in the image, excluding
those that will be transparent in the output due to your
alpha mask, and chooses a color code length accordingly.
There are 92 printable characters that can be used in a
color code. There- fore, if you have 92 or fewer colors,
your color codes will be one character. If you have more
than 92 but not more than 92 * 92, your color codes will be
two characters. And so on.</p>

<p>There s one exception to the above: If you specify an
alpha mask (the -alpha option, one unique color code
represents transparent. This is true even if the alpha mask
doesnt actually produce any transparent pixels. So subtract
one from the number of possible colors if you use
-alpha.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -name=xpmname This option specifies the prefix
string which is specified in the resulting XPM output. If
you don t use the -name otpion, ppmtoxpm defaults to the
filename (without extension) of the ppmfile parameter. If
you do not specify -name or ppmfile (i.e. your input is from
Standard Input), the prefix string defaults to the string
noname.</p>

<p>-hexonly This option says never to put color names in
the XPM file, but rather to identify names by hexadecimal
strings that explicitly identify RGB component intensities.
This means the reader of the file need not have access to a
suitable color dictionary to interpret it.</p>

<p>This option was introduced in Netpbm 10.15 (April 2003).
Before that, it was the default, overridden by specifying
-rgb.</p>

<p>-rgb=rgb-textfile This option names the file in which
the color dictionary you want to use resides. By default,
ppmtoxpm uses the system color dictionary .</p>

<p>This option in meaningless when you specify
-hexonly.</p>

<p>Before Netpbm 10.15 (April 2003), ppmtoxpm did not
default to the system color dictionary. If you didnt specify
-rgb, ppm- toxpbm would use only hexadecimal color
specifiers.</p>

<p>-alphamask=pgmfile This option names a PGM file to use
as an alpha (transparency) mask. The file must contain an
image the same dimensions as the input image. ppmtoxpm marks
as transparent any pixel whose position in the alpha mask
image is at most half white.</p>

<p>If you dont specify -alphamask, ppmtoxpm makes all
pixels in the output opaque.</p>

<p>ppmcolormask is one way to generate an alpha mask file.
You might also generate it by extracting transparency
information from an XPM file with the -alphaout option to
xpmtoppm.</p>

<p>There are similar options on other Netpbm converters
that con- vert from formats that include transparency
information too.</p>
