<p>NAME svnserve.conf - Repository configuration file for
svnserve</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS repository-path/conf/svnserve.conf</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION svnserve.conf controls the behavior of the
svnserve daemon on a per- repository basis. It is located in
the conf subdirectory of the repos- itory.</p>

<p>The overall structure of the file is the same as the
structure of Sub- version user configuration files. At the
top level are sections, which are specified by words in
square brackets; inside each section are variable
definitions of the form &quot;variable = value&quot;. Lines
beginning with # are ignored. svnserve.conf currently uses
only one section named &quot;general&quot;, and supports the
following variables:</p>

<p>anon-access = none|read|write Determines the access
level for unauthenticated users. write access allows all
repository operations. read access allows all operations
except committing and changing revision properties. none
access allows no access. The default level is read.</p>

<p>auth-access = none|read|write Determines the access
level for authenticated users, using the same access levels
as above. The default level is write.</p>

<p>password-db = filename Sets the location of the password
database. filename may be rela- tive to the repository conf
directory. There is no default value. The password database
has the same overall format as this file. It uses only one
section &quot;users&quot;; each variable within the section
is a username, and each value is a password.</p>

<p>authz-db = filename The authz-db option controls the
location of the authorization rules for path-based access
control. filename may be relative to the repository conf
directory. There is no default value. If you don t specify
an authz-db, no path-based access control is done.</p>

<p>realm = realm-name Sets the authentication realm of the
repository. If two reposito- ries have the same password
database, they should have the same realm, and vice versa;
this association allows clients to use a single cached
password for several repositories. The default realm value
is the repositorys uuid.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE The following example svnserve.conf allows read
access for authenti- cated users, no access for anonymous
users, points to a passwd database in the same directory,
and defines a realm name.</p>

<p>[general] anon-access = none auth-access = read
password-db = passwd realm = My First Repository</p>

<p>The file &quot;passwd&quot; would look like:</p>

<p>[users] joeuser = joepassword jayrandom = randomjay</p>
