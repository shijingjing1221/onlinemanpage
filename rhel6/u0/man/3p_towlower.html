<p>TOWLOWER(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual TOWLOWER(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME towlower - transliterate uppercase wide-character
code to lowercase</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;wctype.h&gt;</p>

<p>wint_t towlower(wint_t wc);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The towlower() function has as a domain a
type wint_t, the value of which the application shall ensure
is a character representable as a wchar_t, and a
wide-character code corresponding to a valid character in
the current locale or the value of WEOF. If the argument has
any other value, the behavior is undefined. If the argument
of towlower() represents an uppercase wide-character code,
and there exists a corre- sponding lowercase wide-character
code (as defined by character type information in the
program locale category LC_CTYPE ), the result shall be the
corresponding lowercase wide-character code. All other argu-
ments in the domain are returned unchanged.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, towlower()
shall return the lowercase let- ter corresponding to the
argument passed; otherwise, it shall return the argument
unchanged.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>
