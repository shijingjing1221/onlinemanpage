<p>NAME pam_acct_mgmt - PAM account validation
management</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;security/pam_appl.h&gt;</p>

<p>int pam_acct_mgmt(pam_handle_t *pamh, int flags);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pam_acct_mgmt function is used to
determine if the users account is valid. It checks for
authentication token and account expiration and verifies
access restrictions. It is typically called after the user
has been authenticated.</p>

<p>The pamh argument is an authentication handle obtained
by a prior call to pam_start(). The flags argument is the
binary or of zero or more of the following values:</p>

<p>PAM_SILENT Do not emit any messages.</p>

<p>PAM_DISALLOW_NULL_AUTHTOK The PAM module service should
return PAM_NEW_AUTHTOK_REQD if the user has a null
authentication token.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUES PAM_ACCT_EXPIRED User account has
expired.</p>

<p>PAM_AUTH_ERR Authentication failure.</p>

<p>PAM_NEW_AUTHTOK_REQD The user account is valid but their
authentication token is expired. The correct response to
this return-value is to require that the user satisfies the
pam_chauthtok() function before obtaining service. It may
not be possible for some applications to do this. In such
cases, the user should be denied access until such time as
they can update their password.</p>

<p>PAM_PERM_DENIED Permission denied.</p>

<p>PAM_SUCCESS The authentication token was successfully
updated.</p>

<p>PAM_USER_UNKNOWN User unknown to password service.</p>
