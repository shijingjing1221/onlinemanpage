<p>SYNOPSIS ioblock.end</p>

<p>VALUES None</p>

number of the mapped file bytes_done - number of bytes
transferred sector - beginning sector for the entire bio
flags - see below BIO_UPTODATE 0 ok after I/O completion
BIO_RW_BLOCK 1 RW_AHEAD set, and read/write would block

binary trace for read/write request vcnt - bio vector count
which represents number of array element (page, offset,
length) which makes up this I/O request idx - offset into
the bio vector array phys_segments - number of segments in
this bio after physical address coalescing is performed.
hw_segments - number of segments after physical and DMA
