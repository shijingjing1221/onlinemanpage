<p>NAME krb5-send-pr - send problem report (PR) to a
central support site</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS krb5-send-pr [ site ] [ -f problem-report ] [
-t mail-address ] [ -P ] [ -L ] [ -s severity ] [ -c address
] [ --request-id ] [ -V ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION krb5-send-pr is a tool used to submit
problem reports (PRs) to a cen- tral support site. In most
cases the correct site will be the default. This argument
indicates the support site which is responsible for the
category of problem involved. Some sites may use a local
address as a default. site values are defined by using the
aliases(5).</p>

<p>krb5-send-pr invokes an editor on a problem report
template (after try- ing to fill in some fields with
reasonable default values). When you exit the editor,
krb5-send-pr sends the completed form to the Problem Report
Management System (GNATS) at a central support site. At the
support site, the PR is assigned a unique number and is
stored in the GNATS database according to its category and
submitter-id. GNATS auto- matically replies with an
acknowledgement, citing the category and the PR number.</p>

<p>To ensure that a PR is handled promptly, it should
contain your (unique) submitter-id and one of the available
categories to identify the problem area. (Usekrb5-send-pr
-Lto see a list of categories.)</p>

<p>The krb5-send-pr template at your site should already be
customized with your submitter-id (running install-sid
submitter-id to accom- plish this is part of the
installation procedures for krb5-send-pr). If this hasnt
been done, see your system administrator for your sub-
mitter-id, or request one from your support site by invoking
krb5-send-pr --request-id . If your site does not
distinguish between different user sites, or if you are not
affiliated with the support site, usenetfor this field.</p>

<p>The more precise your problem description and the more
complete your information, the faster your support team can
solve your problems.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -f problem-report specify a file
(problem-report) which already contains a com- plete problem
report. krb5-send-pr sends the contents of the file without
invoking the editor. If the value for problem- report is ,
then krb5-send-pr reads from standard input.</p>

<p>-s severity Give the problem report the severity
severity.</p>

<p>-t mail-address Change mail address at the support site
for problem reports. The default mail-address is the address
used for the default site. Use the site argument rather than
this option in nearly all cases.</p>

<p>-c address Put address in the Cc: header of the
message.</p>

<p>-P print the form specified by the environment variable
PR_FORM on standard output. If PR_FORM is not set, print the
standard blank PR template. No mail is sent.</p>

<p>-L print the list of available categories. No mail is
sent.</p>

<p>--request-id sends mail to the default support site, or
site if specified, with a request for your submitter-id. If
you are not affiliated with site, use a submitter-id of
net.</p>

<p>-V Display the krb5-send-pr version number.</p>

<p>Note: use krb5-send-pr to submit problem reports rather
than mailing them directly. Using both the template and
krb5-send-pr itself will help ensure all necessary
information will reach the support site.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT The environment variable EDITOR specifies
the editor to invoke on the template. default: vi</p>

<p>If the environment variable PR_FORM is set, then its
value is used as the file name of the template for your
problem-report editing session. You can use this to start
with a partially completed form (for example, a form with
the identification fields already completed).</p>

<p>HOW TO FILL OUT A PROBLEM REPORT Problem reports have to
be in a particular form so that a program can easily manage
them. Please remember the following guidelines:</p>

<p>&middot; describe only one problem with each problem
report.</p>

<p>&middot; For follow-up mail, use the same subject line
as the one in the automatic acknowledgent. It consists of
category, PR number and the original synopsis line. This
allows the support site to relate sev- eral mail messages to
a particular PR and to record them automati- cally.</p>

<p>&middot; Please try to be as accurate as possible in the
subject and/or syn- opsis line.</p>

<p>&middot; The subject and the synopsis line are not
confidential. This is because open-bugs lists are compiled
from them. Avoid confidential information there.</p>

<p>See the GNU Info file krb5-send-pr.info or the document

information on reporting problems</p>

<p>HOW TO SUBMIT TEST CASES, CODE, ETC. Submit small code
samples with the PR. Contact the support site for
instructions on submitting larger test cases and problematic
source code.</p>

/tmp/pf$$ copy of empty PR form, for testing purposes
/tmp/pbad$$ file for rejected PRs</p>
