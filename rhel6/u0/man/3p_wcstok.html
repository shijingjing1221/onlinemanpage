<p>WCSTOK(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual WCSTOK(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME wcstok - split a wide-character string into
tokens</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;wchar.h&gt;</p>

<p>wchar_t *wcstok(wchar_t *restrict ws1, const wchar_t
*restrict ws2, wchar_t **restrict ptr);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION A sequence of calls to wcstok() shall break
the wide-character string pointed to by ws1 into a sequence
of tokens, each of which shall be delimited by a
wide-character code from the wide-character string pointed
to by ws2. The ptr argument points to a caller-provided
wchar_t pointer into which the wcstok() function shall store
information neces- sary for it to continue scanning the same
wide-character string.</p>

<p>The first call in the sequence has ws1 as its first
argument, and is followed by calls with a null pointer as
their first argument. The sep- arator string pointed to by
ws2 may be different from call to call.</p>

<p>The first call in the sequence shall search the
wide-character string pointed to by ws1 for the first
wide-character code that is not con- tained in the current
separator string pointed to by ws2. If no such
wide-character code is found, then there are no tokens in
the wide- character string pointed to by ws1 and wcstok()
shall return a null pointer. If such a wide-character code
is found, it shall be the start of the first token.</p>

<p>The wcstok() function shall then search from there for a
wide-character code that is contained in the current
separator string. If no such wide-character code is found,
the current token extends to the end of the wide-character
string pointed to by ws1, and subsequent searches for a
token shall return a null pointer. If such a wide-character
code is found, it shall be overwritten by a null wide
character, which ter- minates the current token. The
wcstok() function shall save a pointer to the following
wide-character code, from which the next search for a token
shall start.</p>

<p>Each subsequent call, with a null pointer as the value
of the first argument, shall start searching from the saved
pointer and behave as described above.</p>

<p>The implementation shall behave as if no function calls
wcstok().</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, the wcstok()
function shall return a pointer to the first wide-character
code of a token. Otherwise, if there is no token, wcstok()
shall return a null pointer.</p>
