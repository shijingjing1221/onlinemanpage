<p>POSIX_SPAWN(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
POSIX_SPAWN(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME posix_spawn, posix_spawnp - spawn a process
(ADVANCED REALTIME)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;spawn.h&gt;</p>

<p>int posix_spawn(pid_t *restrict pid, const char
*restrict path, const posix_spawn_file_actions_t
*file_actions, const posix_spawnattr_t *restrict attrp, char
*const argv[restrict], char *const envp[restrict]); int
posix_spawnp(pid_t *restrict pid, const char *restrict file,
const posix_spawn_file_actions_t *file_actions, const
posix_spawnattr_t *restrict attrp, char *const
argv[restrict], char * const envp[restrict]);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The posix_spawn() and posix_spawnp()
functions shall create a new pro- cess (child process) from
the specified process image. The new process image shall be
constructed from a regular executable file called the new
process image file.</p>

<p>When a C program is executed as the result of this call,
it shall be entered as a C-language function call as
follows:</p>

<p>int main(int argc, char *argv[]);</p>

<p>where argc is the argument count and argv is an array of
character pointers to the arguments themselves. In addition,
the following vari- able:</p>

<p>extern char **environ;</p>

<p>shall be initialized as a pointer to an array of
character pointers to the environment strings.</p>

<p>The argument argv is an array of character pointers to
null-terminated strings. The last member of this array shall
be a null pointer and is not counted in argc. These strings
constitute the argument list avail- able to the new process
image. The value in argv[0] should point to a filename that
is associated with the process image being started by the
posix_spawn() or posix_spawnp() function.</p>

<p>The argument envp is an array of character pointers to
null-terminated strings. These strings constitute the
environment for the new process image. The environment array
is terminated by a null pointer.</p>

<p>The number of bytes available for the child process
combined argument and environment lists is {ARG_MAX}. The
implementation shall specify in the system documentation
(see the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,
Chapter 2, Conformance) whether any list over- head, such as
length words, null terminators, pointers, or alignment
bytes, is included in this total.</p>

<p>The path argument to posix_spawn() is a pathname that
identifies the new process image file to execute.</p>

<p>The file parameter to posix_spawnp() shall be used to
construct a path- name that identifies the new process image
file. If the file parameter contains a slash character, the
file parameter shall be used as the pathname for the new
process image file. Otherwise, the path prefix for this file
shall be obtained by a search of the directories passed as
the environment variable PATH (see the Base Definitions
volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Chapter 8, Environment
Variables). If this envi- ronment variable is not defined,
the results of the search are imple- mentation-defined.</p>

<p>If file_actions is a null pointer, then file descriptors
open in the calling process shall remain open in the child
process, except for those whose close-on- exec flag
FD_CLOEXEC is set (see fcntl()). For those file descriptors
that remain open, all attributes of the corre- sponding open
file descriptions, including file locks (see fcntl()), shall
remain unchanged.</p>

<p>If file_actions is not NULL, then the file descriptors
open in the child process shall be those open in the calling
process as modified by the spawn file actions object pointed
to by file_actions and the FD_CLOEXEC flag of each remaining
open file descriptor after the spawn file actions have been
processed. The effective order of processing the spawn file
actions shall be:</p>

<p>1. The set of open file descriptors for the child
process shall ini- tially be the same set as is open for the
calling process. All attributes of the corresponding open
file descriptions, including file locks (see fcntl()), shall
remain unchanged.</p>

<p>2. The signal mask, signal default actions, and the
effective user and group IDs for the child process shall be
changed as specified in the attributes object referenced by
attrp.</p>

<p>3. The file actions specified by the spawn file actions
object shall be performed in the order in which they were
added to the spawn file actions object.</p>

<p>4. Any file descriptor that has its FD_CLOEXEC flag set
(see fcntl() ) shall be closed.</p>

<p>The posix_spawnattr_t spawn attributes object type is
defined in &lt;spawn.h&gt;. It shall contain at least the
attributes defined below.</p>

<p>If the POSIX_SPAWN_SETPGROUP flag is set in the
spawn-flags attribute of the object referenced by attrp, and
the spawn-pgroup attribute of the same object is non-zero,
then the childs process group shall be as specified in the
spawn-pgroup attribute of the object referenced by
attrp.</p>

<p>As a special case, if the POSIX_SPAWN_SETPGROUP flag is
set in the spawn-flags attribute of the object referenced by
attrp, and the spawn- pgroup attribute of the same object is
set to zero, then the child shall be in a new process group
with a process group ID equal to its process ID.</p>

<p>If the POSIX_SPAWN_SETPGROUP flag is not set in the
spawn-flags attribute of the object referenced by attrp, the
new child process shall inherit the parents process
group.</p>

<p>If the POSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDPARAM flag is set in the
spawn-flags attribute of the object referenced by attrp, but
POSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHED- ULER is not set, the new process image
shall initially have the scheduling policy of the calling
process with the scheduling parameters specified in the
spawn-schedparam attribute of the object referenced by
attrp.</p>

<p>If the POSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDULER flag is set in the
spawn-flags attribute of the object referenced by attrp
(regardless of the setting of the POSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDPARAM
flag), the new process image shall initially have the
scheduling policy specified in the spawn-schedpolicy
attribute of the object referenced by attrp and the
scheduling parame- ters specified in the spawn-schedparam
attribute of the same object.</p>

<p>The POSIX_SPAWN_RESETIDS flag in the spawn-flags
attribute of the object referenced by attrp governs the
effective user ID of the child process. If this flag is not
set, the child process shall inherit the parent process
effective user ID. If this flag is set, the child pro- cess
effective user ID shall be reset to the parents real user
ID. In either case, if the set-user-ID mode bit of the new
process image file is set, the effective user ID of the
child process shall become that file s owner ID before the
new process image begins execution.</p>

<p>The POSIX_SPAWN_RESETIDS flag in the spawn-flags
attribute of the object referenced by attrp also governs the
effective group ID of the child process. If this flag is not
set, the child process shall inherit the parent process
effective group ID. If this flag is set, the child process
effective group ID shall be reset to the parent s real group
ID. In either case, if the set-group-ID mode bit of the new
process image file is set, the effective group ID of the
child process shall become that files group ID before the
new process image begins execu- tion.</p>

<p>If the POSIX_SPAWN_SETSIGMASK flag is set in the
spawn-flags attribute of the object referenced by attrp, the
child process shall initially have the signal mask specified
in the spawn-sigmask attribute of the object referenced by
attrp.</p>

<p>If the POSIX_SPAWN_SETSIGDEF flag is set in the
spawn-flags attribute of the object referenced by attrp, the
signals specified in the spawn- sigdefault attribute of the
same object shall be set to their default actions in the
child process. Signals set to the default action in the
parent process shall be set to the default action in the
child process.</p>

<p>Signals set to be caught by the calling process shall be
set to the default action in the child process.</p>

<p>Except for SIGCHLD, signals set to be ignored by the
calling process image shall be set to be ignored by the
child process, unless otherwise specified by the
POSIX_SPAWN_SETSIGDEF flag being set in the spawn- flags
attribute of the object referenced by attrp and the signals
being indicated in the spawn-sigdefault attribute of the
object referenced by attrp.</p>

<p>If the SIGCHLD signal is set to be ignored by the
calling process, it is unspecified whether the SIGCHLD
signal is set to be ignored or to the default action in the
child process, unless otherwise specified by the
POSIX_SPAWN_SETSIGDEF flag being set in the spawn_flags
attribute of the object referenced by attrp and the SIGCHLD
signal being indi- cated in the spawn_sigdefault attribute
of the object referenced by attrp.</p>

<p>If the value of the attrp pointer is NULL, then the
default values are used.</p>

<p>All process attributes, other than those influenced by
the attributes set in the object referenced by attrp as
specified above or by the file descriptor manipulations
specified in file_actions, shall appear in the new process
image as though fork() had been called to create a child
process and then a member of the exec family of functions
had been called by the child process to execute the new
process image.</p>

<p>It is implementation-defined whether the fork handlers
are run when posix_spawn() or posix_spawnp() is called.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, posix_spawn()
and posix_spawnp() shall return the process ID of the child
process to the parent process, in the variable pointed to by
a non-NULL pid argument, and shall return zero as the
function return value. Otherwise, no child process shall be
created, the value stored into the variable pointed to by a
non-NULL pid is unspecified, and an error number shall be
returned as the func- tion return value to indicate the
error. If the pid argument is a null pointer, the process ID
of the child is not returned to the caller.</p>

<p>ERRORS The posix_spawn() and posix_spawnp() functions
may fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The value specified by file_actions or attrp is
invalid.</p>

<p>If this error occurs after the calling process
successfully returns from the posix_spawn() or
posix_spawnp() function, the child process may exit with
exit status 127.</p>

<p>If posix_spawn() or posix_spawnp() fail for any of the
reasons that would cause fork() or one of the exec family of
functions to fail, an error value shall be returned as
described by fork() and exec, respec- tively (or, if the
error occurs after the calling process successfully returns,
the child process shall exit with exit status 127).</p>

<p>If POSIX_SPAWN_SETPGROUP is set in the spawn-flags
attribute of the object referenced by attrp, and
posix_spawn() or posix_spawnp() fails while changing the
child s process group, an error value shall be returned as
described by setpgid() (or, if the error occurs after the
calling process successfully returns, the child process
shall exit with exit status 127).</p>

<p>If POSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDPARAM is set and
POSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDULER is not set in the spawn-flags
attribute of the object referenced by attrp, then if
posix_spawn() or posix_spawnp() fails for any of the reasons
that would cause sched_setparam() to fail, an error value
shall be returned as described by sched_setparam() (or, if
the error occurs after the calling process successfully
returns, the child process shall exit with exit status
127).</p>

<p>If POSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDULER is set in the spawn-flags
attribute of the object referenced by attrp, and if
posix_spawn() or posix_spawnp() fails for any of the reasons
that would cause sched_setscheduler() to fail, an error
value shall be returned as described by sched_setsched-
uler() (or, if the error occurs after the calling process
successfully returns, the child process shall exit with exit
status 127).</p>

<p>If the file_actions argument is not NULL, and specifies
any close, dup2, or open actions to be performed, and if
posix_spawn() or posix_spawnp() fails for any of the reasons
that would cause close(), dup2(), or open() to fail, an
error value shall be returned as described by close(),
dup2(), and open(), respectively (or, if the error occurs
after the calling process successfully returns, the child
process shall exit with exit status 127). An open file
action may, by itself, result in any of the errors described
by close() or dup2(), in addition to those described by
open().</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE These functions are part of the Spawn
option and need not be provided on all implementations.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The posix_spawn() function and its close
relation posix_spawnp() have been introduced to overcome the
following perceived difficulties with fork(): the fork()
function is difficult or impossible to implement without
swapping or dynamic address translation.</p>

<p>* Swapping is generally too slow for a realtime
environment.</p>

<p>* Dynamic address translation is not available
everywhere that POSIX might be useful.</p>

<p>* Processes are too useful to simply option out of POSIX
whenever it must run without address translation or other
MMU services.</p>

<p>Thus, POSIX needs process creation and file execution
primitives that can be efficiently implemented without
address translation or other MMU services.</p>

<p>The posix_spawn() function is implementable as a library
routine, but both posix_spawn() and posix_spawnp() are
designed as kernel opera- tions. Also, although they may be
an efficient replacement for many fork()/ exec pairs, their
goal is to provide useful process creation primitives for
systems that have difficulty with fork(), not to provide
drop-in replacements for fork()/ exec.</p>

<p>This view of the role of posix_spawn() and
posix_spawnp() influenced the design of their API. It does
not attempt to provide the full func- tionality of fork()/
exec in which arbitrary user-specified operations of any
sort are permitted between the creation of the child process
and the execution of the new process image; any attempt to
reach that level would need to provide a programming
language as parameters. Instead, posix_spawn() and
posix_spawnp() are process creation primitives like the
Start_Process and Start_Process_Search Ada language bindings
pack- age POSIX_Process_Primitives and also like those in
many operating sys- tems that are not UNIX systems, but with
some POSIX-specific additions.</p>

<p>To achieve its coverage goals, posix_spawn() and
posix_spawnp() have control of six types of inheritance:
file descriptors, process group ID, user and group ID,
signal mask, scheduling, and whether each signal ignored in
the parent will remain ignored in the child, or be reset to
its default action in the child.</p>

<p>Control of file descriptors is required to allow an
independently writ- ten child process image to access data
streams opened by and even gen- erated or read by the parent
process without being specifically coded to know which
parent files and file descriptors are to be used. Control of
the process group ID is required to control how the child
process job control relates to that of the parent.</p>

<p>Control of the signal mask and signal defaulting is
sufficient to sup- port the implementation of system().
Although support for system() is not explicitly one of the
goals for posix_spawn() and posix_spawnp(), it is covered
under the &quot;at least 50%&quot; coverage goal.</p>

<p>The intention is that the normal file descriptor
inheritance across fork(), the subsequent effect of the
specified spawn file actions, and the normal file descriptor
inheritance across one of the exec family of functions
should fully specify open file inheritance. The implementa-
tion need make no decisions regarding the set of open file
descriptors when the child process image begins execution,
those decisions having already been made by the caller and
expressed as the set of open file descriptors and their
FD_CLOEXEC flags at the time of the call and the spawn file
actions object specified in the call. We have been assured
that in cases where the POSIX Start_Process Ada primitives
have been implemented in a library, this method of
controlling file descriptor inheritance may be implemented
very easily.</p>

<p>We can identify several problems with posix_spawn() and
posix_spawnp(), but there does not appear to be a solution
that introduces fewer prob- lems. Environment modification
for child process attributes not speci- fiable via the attrp
or file_actions arguments must be done in the par- ent
process, and since the parent generally wants to save its
context, it is more costly than similar functionality with
fork()/ exec. It is also complicated to modify the
environment of a multi-threaded process temporarily, since
all threads must agree when it is safe for the envi- ronment
to be changed. However, this cost is only borne by those
invo- cations of posix_spawn() and posix_spawnp() that use
the additional functionality. Since extensive modifications
are not the usual case, and are particularly unlikely in
time-critical code, keeping much of the environment control
out of posix_spawn() and posix_spawnp() is appropriate
design.</p>

<p>The posix_spawn() and posix_spawnp() functions do not
have all the power of fork()/ exec. This is to be expected.
The fork() function is a wonderfully powerful operation. We
do not expect to duplicate its functionality in a simple,
fast function with no special hardware requirements. It is
worth noting that posix_spawn() and posix_spawnp() are very
similar to the process creation operations on many operating
systems that are not UNIX systems.</p>

<p>Requirements The requirements for posix_spawn() and
posix_spawnp() are:</p>

<p>* They must be implementable without an MMU or unusual
hardware.</p>

<p>* They must be compatible with existing POSIX
standards.</p>

<p>Additional goals are:</p>

<p>* They should be efficiently implementable.</p>

<p>* They should be able to replace at least 50% of typical
executions of fork().</p>

<p>* A system with posix_spawn() and posix_spawnp() and
without fork() should be useful, at least for realtime
applications.</p>

<p>* A system with fork() and the exec family should be
able to implement posix_spawn() and posix_spawnp() as
library routines.</p>

<p>Two-Syntax POSIX exec has several calling sequences with
approximately the same functionality. These appear to be
required for compatibility with existing practice. Since the
existing practice for the posix_spawn*() functions is
otherwise substantially unlike POSIX, we feel that sim-
plicity outweighs compatibility. There are, therefore, only
two names for the posix_spawn*() functions.</p>

<p>The parameter list does not differ between posix_spawn()
and posix_spawnp(); posix_spawnp() interprets the second
parameter more elaborately than posix_spawn().</p>

<p>Compatibility with POSIX.5 (Ada) The Start_Process and
Start_Process_Search procedures from the
POSIX_Process_Primitives package from the Ada language
binding to POSIX.1 encapsulate fork() and exec functionality
in a manner similar to that of posix_spawn() and
posix_spawnp(). Originally, in keeping with our simplicity
goal, the standard developers had limited the capa- bilities
of posix_spawn() and posix_spawnp() to a subset of the capa-
bilities of Start_Process and Start_Process_Search; certain
non-default capabilities were not supported. However, based
on suggestions by the ballot group to improve file
descriptor mapping or drop it, and on the advice of an Ada
Language Bindings working group member, the standard
developers decided that posix_spawn() and posix_spawnp()
should be suf- ficiently powerful to implement Start_Process
and Start_Process_Search. The rationale is that if the Ada
language binding to such a primitive had already been
approved as an IEEE standard, there can be little jus-
tification for not approving the functionally-equivalent
parts of a C binding. The only three capabilities provided
by posix_spawn() and posix_spawnp() that are not provided by
Start_Process and Start_Pro- cess_Search are optionally
specifying the childs process group ID, the set of signals
to be reset to default signal handling in the child pro-
cess, and the childs scheduling policy and parameters.</p>

<p>For the Ada language binding for Start_Process to be
implemented with posix_spawn(), that binding would need to
explicitly pass an empty sig- nal mask and the parents
environment to posix_spawn() whenever the caller of
Start_Process allowed these arguments to default, since
posix_spawn() does not provide such defaults. The ability of
Start_Pro- cess to mask user-specified signals during its
execution is function- ally unique to the Ada language
binding and must be dealt with in the binding separately
from the call to posix_spawn().</p>

<p>Process Group The process group inheritance field can be
used to join the child pro- cess with an existing process
group. By assigning a value of zero to the spawn-pgroup
attribute of the object referenced by attrp, the setpgid()
mechanism will place the child process in a new process
group.</p>

<p>Threads Without the posix_spawn() and posix_spawnp()
functions, systems without address translation can still use
threads to give an abstraction of concurrency. In many
cases, thread creation suffices, but it is not always a good
substitute. The posix_spawn() and posix_spawnp() func- tions
are considerably &quot;heavier&quot; than thread creation.
Processes have several important attributes that threads do
not. Even without address translation, a process may have
base-and-bound memory protection. Each process has a process
environment including security attributes and file
capabilities, and powerful scheduling attributes. Processes
abstract the behavior of non-uniform-memory-architecture
multi-proces- sors better than threads, and they are more
convenient to use for activities that are not closely
linked.</p>

<p>The posix_spawn() and posix_spawnp() functions may not
bring support for multiple processes to every configuration.
Process creation is not the only piece of operating system
support required to support multiple processes. The total
cost of support for multiple processes may be quite high in
some circumstances. Existing practice shows that support for
multiple processes is uncommon and threads are common among
&quot;tiny kernels&quot;. There should, therefore, probably
continue to be AEPs for operating systems with only one
process.</p>

<p>Asynchronous Error Notification A library implementation
of posix_spawn() or posix_spawnp() may not be able to detect
all possible errors before it forks the child process. IEEE
Std 1003.1-2001 provides for an error indication returned
from a child process which could not successfully complete
the spawn operation via a special exit status which may be
detected using the status value returned by wait() and
waitpid().</p>

<p>The stat_val interface and the macros used to interpret
it are not well suited to the purpose of returning API
errors, but they are the only path available to a library
implementation. Thus, an implementation may cause the child
process to exit with exit status 127 for any error detected
during the spawn process after the posix_spawn() or
posix_spawnp() function has successfully returned.</p>

<p>The standard developers had proposed using two
additional macros to interpret stat_val. The first,
WIFSPAWNFAIL, would have detected a sta- tus that indicated
that the child exited because of an error detected during
the posix_spawn() or posix_spawnp() operations rather than
dur- ing actual execution of the child process image; the
second, WSPAWN- ERRNO, would have extracted the error value
if WIFSPAWNFAIL indicated a failure. Unfortunately, the
ballot group strongly opposed this because it would make a
library implementation of posix_spawn() or posix_spawnp()
dependent on kernel modifications to waitpid() to be able to
embed special information in stat_val to indicate a spawn
fail- ure.</p>

<p>The 8 bits of child process exit status that are
guaranteed by IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 to be accessible to the
waiting parent process are insufficient to disambiguate a
spawn error from any other kind of error that may be
returned by an arbitrary process image. No other bits of the
exit status are required to be visible in stat_val, so these
macros could not be strictly implemented at the library
level. Reserving an exit status of 127 for such spawn errors
is consistent with the use of this value by system() and
popen() to signal failures in these opera- tions that occur
after the function has returned but before a shell is able
to execute. The exit status of 127 does not uniquely
identify this class of error, nor does it provide any
detailed information on the nature of the failure. Note that
a kernel implementation of posix_spawn() or posix_spawnp()
is permitted (and encouraged) to return any possible error
as the function value, thus providing more detailed failure
information to the parent process.</p>

<p>Thus, no special macros are available to isolate
asynchronous posix_spawn() or posix_spawnp() errors.
Instead, errors detected by the posix_spawn() or
posix_spawnp() operations in the context of the child
process before the new process image executes are reported
by setting the childs exit status to 127. The calling
process may use the WIFEX- ITED and WEXITSTATUS macros on
the stat_val stored by the wait() or waitpid() functions to
detect spawn failures to the extent that other status values
with which the child process image may exit (before the
parent can conclusively determine that the child process
image has begun execution) are distinct from exit status
127.</p>
