<p>NAME tiffdither - convert a greyscale image to bilevel
using dithering</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS tiffdither [ options ] input.tif output.tif</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION tiffdither converts a single channel 8-bit
greyscale image to a bilevel image using Floyd-Steinberg
error propagation with thresholding.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -c Specify the compression to use for data
written to the output file: none for no compression,
packbits for PackBits compres- sion, lzw for Lempel-Ziv
&amp; Welch compression, zip for Deflate compression, g3 for
CCITT Group 3 (T.4) compression, and g4 for CCITT Group 4
(T.6) compression. By default tiffdither will compress data
according to the value of the Compression tag found in the
source file.</p>

<p>The CCITT Group 3 and Group 4 compression algorithms can
only be used with bilevel data.</p>

<p>Group 3 compression can be specified together with
several T.4-specific options: 1d for 1-dimensional encoding,
2d for 2-dimensional encoding, and fill to force each
encoded scanline to be zero-filled so that the terminating
EOL code lies on a byte boundary. Group 3-specific options
are specified by appending a :-separated list to the g3
option; e.g. -c g3:2d:fill to get 2D-encoded data with
byte-aligned EOL codes.</p>

<p>LZW compression can be specified together with a
predictor value. A predictor value of 2 causes each scanline
of the out- put image to undergo horizontal differencing
before it is encoded; a value of 1 forces each scanline to
be encoded without differencing. LZW-specific options are
specified by appending a :-separated list to the lzw option;
e.g. -c lzw:2 for LZW compression with horizontal
differencing.</p>

<p>-f Specify the bit fill order to use in writing output
data. By default, tiffdither will create a new file with the
same fill order as the original. Specifying -f lsb2msb will
force data to be written with the FillOrder tag set to
LSB2MSB , while -f msb2lsb will force data to be written
with the FillOrder tag set to MSB2LSB .</p>

<p>-t Set the threshold value for dithering. By default the
threshold value is 128.</p>

<p>NOTES The dither algorithm is taken from the
tiffmedian(1) program (written by Paul Heckbert).</p>
