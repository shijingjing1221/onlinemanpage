<p>MCEDIT(1) GNU Midnight Commander MCEDIT(1)</p>

<p>NAME mcedit - Internal file editor of GNU Midnight
Commander.</p>

<p>USAGE mcedit [-bcCdfhstVx?] [+lineno] file</p>

<p>mcedit [-bcCdfhstVx?] file:lineno[:]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION mcedit is a link to mc, the main GNU
Midnight Commander executable. Executing GNU Midnight
Commander under this name requests staring the internal
editor and opening the file specified on the command line.
The editor is based on the terminal version of cooledit -
standalone editor for X Window System.</p>

<p>OPTIONS +lineno Go to the line specified by number (do
not put a space between the + sign and the number).</p>

<p>-b Force black and white display.</p>

<p>-c Force ANSI color mode on terminals that dont seem to
have color support.</p>

<p>-C
&lt;keyword&gt;=&lt;FGcolor&gt;,&lt;BGcolor&gt;:&lt;keyword&gt;=
... Specify a different color set. See the Colors section in
mc(1) for more information.</p>

<p>-d Disable mouse support.</p>

<p>-f Display the compiled-in search path for GNU Midnight
Commander data files.</p>

<p>-t Force using termcap database instead of terminfo.
This option is only applicable if GNU Midnight Commander was
compiled with S-Lang library with terminfo support.</p>

<p>-V Display the version of the program.</p>

<p>-x Force xterm mode. Used when running on xterm-capable
terminals (two screen modes, and able to send mouse escape
sequences).</p>

<p>FEATURES The internal file editor is a full-featured
full screen editor. It can edit files up to 64 megabytes. It
is possible to edit binary files. The features it presently
supports are: block copy, move, delete, cut, paste; key for
key undo; pull-down menus; file insertion; macro com- mands;
regular expression search and replace (and our own
scanf-printf search and replace); shift-arrow text
highlighting (if supported by the terminal);
insert-overwrite toggle; word wrap; autoindent; tunable tab
size; syntax highlighting for various file types; and an
option to pipe text blocks through shell commands like
indent and ispell.</p>

<p>KEYS The editor is easy to use and can be used without
learning. The pull-down menu is invoked by pressing F9. You
can learn other keys from the menu and from the button bar
labels.</p>

<p>In addition to that, Shift combined with arrows does
text highlighting (if supported by the terminal): Ctrl-Ins
copies to the file ~/.mc/cedit/cooledit.clip, Shift-Ins
pastes from ~/.mc/cedit/cooledit.clip, Shift-Del cuts to
~/.mc/cedit/cooledit.clip, and Ctrl-Del deletes highlighted
text. Mouse highlighting also works on some terminals. To
use the standard mouse support provided by your terminal,
hold the Shift key. Please note that the mouse support in
the terminal doesnt share the clipboard with mcedit.</p>

<p>The completion key (usually Meta-Tab or Escape Tab)
completes the word under the cursor using the words used
earlier in the file.</p>

<p>To define a macro, press Ctrl-R and then type out the
keys you want to be executed. Press Ctrl-R again when
finished. You can then assign the macro to any key you like
by pressing that key. The macro is exe- cuted when you press
Ctrl-A and then the assigned key. The macro is also executed
if you press Meta, Ctrl, or Esc and the assigned key,
provided that the key is not used for any other function.
The macro commands are stored in the file
~/.mc/cedit/cooledit.macros. Do NOT edit this file if you
are going to use macros again in the same editing session,
because mcedit caches macro key defines in memory. mcedit
now overwrites a macro if a macro with the same key already
exists, so you wont have to edit this file. You will also
have to restart other run- ning editors for macros to take
effect.</p>

<p>F19 will format C, C++, Java or HTML code when it is
highlighted. An executable file called
~/.mc/cedit/edit.indent.rc will be created for you from the
default template. Feel free to edit it if you need.</p>

<p>C-p will run ispell on a block of text in a similar way.
The script file will be called
~/.mc/cedit/edit.spell.rc.</p>

<p>If some keys don t work, you can use Learn Keys in the
Options menu.</p>

<p>CODE NAVIGATION mcedit can be used to navigation through
code with tags files created by etags or ctags commands. If
there is no file TAGS code navigation would not work. In
example, in case of exuberant-ctags for C language command
will be:</p>

<p>ctags -e --language-force=C -R ./</p>

<p>Meta-Enter show list box to select item under cursor
(cusor should stand at end of word).</p>

<p>Meta-Minus where minus is symbol &quot;-&quot; go to
previous function in naviga- tion list (like a browser
Back).</p>

<p>Meta-Equal where equal is symbol &quot;=&quot; go to
next function in navigation list (like a browser
Forward).</p>

<p>SYNTAX HIGHLIGHTING mcedit supports syntax highlighting.
This means that keywords and con- texts (like C comments,
string constants, etc) are highlighted in dif- ferent
colors. The following section explains the format of the
file ~/.mc/cedit/Syntax. If this file is missing,
system-wide /usr/share/mc/syntax/Syntax is used. The file
~/.mc/cedit/Syntax is rescanned on opening of a any new
editor file. The file contains rules for highlighting, each
of which is given on a separate line, and define which
keywords will be highlighted to what color.</p>

<p>The file is divided into sections, each beginning with a
line with the file command. The sections are normally put
into separate files using the include command.</p>

<p>The file command has three arguments. The first argument
is a regular expression that is applied to the file name to
determine if the follow- ing section applies to the file.
The second argument is the description of the file type. It
is used in cooledit; future versions of mcedit may use it as
well. The third optional argument is a regular expression to
match the first line of text of the file. The rules in the
following section apply if either the file name or the first
line of text matches.</p>

<p>A section ends with the start of another section. Each
section is divided into contexts, and each context contains
rules. A context is a scope within the text that a
particular set of rules belongs to. For instance, the text
within a C style comment (i.e. between /* and */) has its
own color. This is a context, although it has no further
rules inside it because there is probably nothing that we
want highlighted within a C comment.</p>

<p>A trivial C programming section might look like
this:</p>

<p>file ..c Cogramle (#include|/\</p>

<p>wholechars
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ_</p>

<p># default colors define comment brown context default
keyword whole if yellow keyword whole else yellow keyword
whole for yellow keyword whole while yellow keyword whole do
yellow keyword whole switch yellow keyword whole case yellow
keyword whole static yellow keyword whole extern yellow
keyword { brightcyan keyword } brightcyan keyword *
green</p>

<p># C comments context / comment</p>

<p># C preprocessor directives context linestart # red
keyword \ brightred</p>

<p># C string constants context &quot; &quot; green keyword
%d brightgreen keyword %s brightgreen keyword %c brightgreen
keyword \&quot; brightgreen</p>

<p>Each context starts with a line of the form:</p>

<p>context [exclusive] [whole|wholeright|wholeleft]
[linestart] delim [linestart] delim [foreground]
[background]</p>

<p>The first context is an exception. It must start with
the command</p>

<p>context default [foreground] [background]</p>

<p>otherwise mcedit will report an error. The linestart
option specifies that delim must start at the beginning of a
line. The whole option tells that delim must be a whole
word. To specify that a word must begin on the word boundary
only on the left side, you can use the wholeleft option, and
similarly a word that must end on the word bound- ary is
specified by wholeright.</p>

<p>The set of characters that constitute a whole word can
be changed at any point in the file with the wholechars
command. The left and right set of characters can be set
separately with</p>

<p>wholechars [left|right] characters</p>

<p>The exclusive option causes the text between the
delimiters to be high- lighted, but not the delimiters
themselves.</p>

<p>Each rule is a line of the form:</p>

<p>keyword [whole|wholeright|wholeleft] [linestart] string
foreground [background]</p>

<p>Context or keyword strings are interpreted, so that you
can include tabs and spaces with the sequences and Newlines
and backslashes are specified with and \ respectively. Since
whitespace is used as a separator, it may not be used as is.
Also, must be used to spec- ify an asterisk. The * itself is
a wildcard that matches any length of characters. For
example,</p>

<p>keyword * green</p>

<p>colors all C single character constants green. You also
could use</p>

<p>keyword &quot;*&quot; green</p>

<p>to color string constants, but the matched string would
not be allowed to span across multiple newlines. The
wildcard may be used within con- text delimiters as well,
but you cannot have a wildcard as the last or first
character.</p>

<p>Important to note is the line</p>

<p>keyword \ brightgreen</p>

<p>This line defines a keyword containing the backslash and
newline char- acters. Since the keywords are matched before
the context delimiters, this keyword prevents the context
from ending at the end of the lines that end in a backslash,
thus allowing C preprocessor directive to con- tinue across
multiple lines.</p>

<p>The possible colors are: black, gray, red, brightred,
green, bright- green, brown, yellow, blue, brightblue,
magenta, brightmagenta, cyan, brightcyan, lightgray and
white. If the syntax file is shared with cooledit, it is
possible to specify different colors for mcedit and cooledit
by separating them with a slash, e.g.</p>

<p>keyword #include red/Orange</p>

<p>mcedit uses the color before the slash. See cooledit(1)
for supported cooledit colors.</p>

<p>Comments may be put on a separate line starting with the
hash sign (#).</p>

<p>Because of the simplicity of the implementation, there
are a few intri- cacies that will not be dealt with
correctly but these are a minor irritation. On the whole, a
broad spectrum of quite complicated situa- tions are handled
with these simple rules. It is a good idea to take a look at
the syntax file to see some of the nifty tricks you can do
with a little imagination. If you cannot get by with the
rules I have coded, and you think you have a rule that would
be useful, please email me with your request. However, do
not ask for regular expression sup- port, because this is
flatly impossible.</p>

<p>A useful hint is to work with as much as possible with
the things you can do rather than try to do things that this
implementation cannot deal with. Also remember that the aim
of syntax highlighting is to make programming less prone to
error, not to make code look pretty.</p>

<p>COLORS The default colors may be changed by appending to
the MC_COLOR_TABLE environment variable. Foreground and
background colors pairs may be specified for example
with:</p>

<p>MC_COLOR_TABLE=&quot;$MC_COLOR_TABLE:
editnormal=lightgray,black: editbold=yellow,black:
editmarked=black,cyan&quot;</p>

<p>OPTIONS Most options can now be set from the editors
options dialog box. See the Options menu. The following
options are defined in ~/.mc/ini and have obvious
counterparts in the dialog box. You can modify them to
change the editor behavior, by editing the file. Unless
specified, a 1 sets the option to on, and a 0 sets it to
off, as is usual.</p>

<p>use_internal_edit This option is ignored when invoking
mcedit.</p>

<p>editor_tab_spacing Interpret the tab character as being
of this length. Default is 8. You should avoid using other
than 8 since most other editors and text viewers assume a
tab spacing of 8. Use edi- tor_fake_half_tabs to simulate a
smaller tab spacing.</p>

<p>editor_fill_tabs_with_spaces Never insert a tab space.
Rather insert spaces (ascii 20h) to fill to the desired tab
size.</p>

<p>editor_return_does_auto_indent Pressing return will tab
across to match the indentation of the first line above that
has text on it.</p>

<p>editor_backspace_through_tabs Make a single backspace
delete all the space to the left margin if there is no text
between the cursor and the left margin.</p>

<p>editor_fake_half_tabs This will emulate a half tab for
those who want to program with a tab spacing of 4, but do
not want the tab size changed from 8 (so that the code will
be formatted the same when displayed by other programs).
When editing between text and the left margin, moving and
tabbing will be as though a tab space were 4, while actually
using spaces and normal tabs for an optimal fill. When
editing anywhere else, a normal tab is inserted.</p>

<p>editor_option_save_mode Possible values 0, 1 and 2. The
save mode (see the options menu also) allows you to change
the method of saving a file. Quick save (0) saves the file
by immediately, truncating the disk file to zero length
(i.e. erasing it) and the writing the editor contents to the
file. This method is fast, but dangerous, since a system
error during a file save will leave the file only par-
tially written, possibly rendering the data irretrievable.
When saving, the safe save (1) option enables creation of a
temporary file into which the file contents are first
written. In the event of an problem, the original file is
untouched. When the temporary file is successfully written,
it is renamed to the name of the original file, thus
replacing it. The safest method is create backups (2). Where
a backup file is created before any changes are made. You
can specify your own backup file extension in the dialog.
Note that saving twice will replace your backup as well as
your original file.</p>

<p>editor_word_wrap_line_length line length to wrap. 72
default.</p>

<p>editor_backup_extension symbol for add extension to name
of backup files. Default &quot;~&quot;.</p>

<p>editor_line_state show state line of editor now it show
number of file line (in future it can show things like
folding, breakpoints, etc.). M-n toglle this option.</p>

<p>editor_visible_spaces Toggle show visible trailing
spaces (TWS), if editor_visi- ble_spaces=1 TWS showed as
.</p>

<p>editor_visible_tabs Toggle show visible tabs, if
editor_visible_tabs=1 tabs showed as &lt;----&gt;</p>

<p>editor_persistent_selections Do not remove block
selection after moving the cursor.</p>

<p>editor_cursor_beyond_eol Allow moving cursor beyond the
end of line.</p>

<p>editor_syntax_highlighting enable syntax
highlighting.</p>

<p>editor_edit_confirm_save show confirm dialog on
save.</p>

<p>editor_option_typewriter_wrap to be described</p>

<p>editor_option_auto_para_formatting to be described</p>

<p>editor_option_save_position save file position on
exit.</p>

<p>source_codepage symbol representation of codepage name
for file (i.e. CP1251, ~ - default).</p>

<p>editor_wordcompletion_collect_entire_file Search
autocomplete candidates in entire of file or just from begin
of file to cursor position (0)</p>

<p>MISCELLANEOUS You can use scanf search and replace to
search and replace a C format string. First take a look at
the sscanf and sprintf man pages to see what a format string
is and how it works. Heres an example: suppose that you want
to replace all occurrences of an open bracket, three comma
separated numbers, and a close bracket, with the word
apples, the third number, the word oranges and then the
second number. You would fill in the Replace dialog box as
follows:</p>

<p>Enter search string (%d,%d,%d) Enter replace string
apples %d oranges %d Enter replacement argument order
3,2</p>

<p>The last line specifies that the third and then the
second number are to be used in place of the first and
second.</p>

<p>It is advisable to use this feature with Prompt On
Replace on, because a match is thought to be found whenever
the number of arguments found matches the number given,
which is not always a real match. Scanf also treats
whitespace as being elastic. Note that the scanf format %[
is very useful for scanning strings, and whitespace.</p>

<p>The editor also displays non-us characters (160+). When
editing binary files, you should set display bits to 7 bits
in the Midnight Commander options menu to keep the spacing
clean.</p>
