<p>NAME ppmquant - quantize the colors in a PPM image down
to a specified num- ber</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ppmquant [-floyd|-fs] ncolors [ppmfile]
ppmquant [-floyd|-fs] [-nofloyd|-nofs] -mapfile mapfile
[ppmfile]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>ppmquant is obsolete. All it does now is invoke pnmquant
or pnmremap. You should use one of those programs in any new
program, or if you are modifying an old program, and your
program does not have to work with a version of Netpbm
before 9.21 (January 2001). ppmquant exists only for name
compatibility.</p>

<p>pnmquant is fully backward compatible with ppmquant
without the -map- file option; pnmremap is fully backward
compatible with ppmquant with the -mapfile option.</p>

<p>All options can be abbreviated to their shortest unique
prefix. You may use two hyphens instead of one to designate
an option. You may use either white space or equals signs
between an option name and its value.</p>

<p>Except with differences suggested by the syntax synopsis
above, ppmquants function is the same as pnmquant and
pnmremap.</p>

<p>Before Netpbm 10.19 (November 2003), ppmquant was a
completely separate program from pnmquant, and was a bona
fide PPM program. That means if you gave it a PGM or PBM
image as input, it would process it as if it were PPM and
generate a PPM output. Now, since it is really a PNM pro-
gram, it processes PBM and PGM inputs as what they are and
produces the same kind of output.</p>

<p>Note: The reason ppmquant was changed in Netpbm 10.19 is
that for some time before that, ppmquant had a serious bug
that would have been dif- ficult to fix -- it chose the
wrong color set. Maintaining two ver- sions of the same code
did not make sense.</p>
