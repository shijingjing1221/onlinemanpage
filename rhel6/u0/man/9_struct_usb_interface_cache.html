<p>STRUCT USB_INTERFACE(9) Host-Side Data Types and Macro
STRUCT USB_INTERFACE(9)</p>

<p>NAME struct_usb_interface_cache - long-term
representation of a device interface</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS struct usb_interface_cache { unsigned
num_altsetting; struct kref ref; struct usb_host_interface
altsetting[0]; };</p>

<p>MEMBERS num_altsetting number of altsettings
defined.</p>

<p>ref reference counter.</p>

<p>altsetting[0] variable-length array of interface
structures, one for each alternate setting that may be
selected. Each one includes a set of endpoint
configurations. They will be in no particular order.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION These structures persist for the lifetime of
a usb_device, unlike struct usb_interface (which persists
only as long as its configuration is installed). The
altsetting arrays can be accessed through these structures
at any time, permitting comparison of configurations and
providing support for the /proc/bus/usb/devices
pseudo-file.</p>
