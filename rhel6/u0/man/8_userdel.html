<p>USERDEL(8) System Management Commands USERDEL(8)</p>

<p>NAME userdel - delete a user account and related
files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS userdel [options] LOGIN</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The userdel command modifies the system
account files, deleting all entries that refer to the user
name LOGIN. The named user must exist.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The options which apply to the userdel command
are:</p>

<p>-f, --force This option forces the removal of the user
account, even if the user is still logged in. It also forces
userdel to remove the user&acute;s home directory and mail
spool, even if another user uses the same home directory or
if the mail spool is not owned by the specified user. If
USERGROUPS_ENAB is defined to yes in /etc/login.defs and if
a group exists with the same name as the deleted user, then
this group will be removed, even if it is still the primary
group of another user.</p>

<p>Note: This option is dangerous and may leave your system
in an inconsistent state.</p>

<p>-h, --help Display help message and exit.</p>

<p>-r, --remove Files in the user&acute;s home directory
will be removed along with the home directory itself and the
user&acute;s mail spool. Files located in other file systems
will have to be searched for and deleted manually.</p>

<p>The mail spool is defined by the MAIL_DIR variable in
the login.defs file.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION The following configuration variables in
/etc/login.defs change the behavior of this tool:</p>

<p>MAIL_DIR (string) The mail spool directory. This is
needed to manipulate the mailbox when its corresponding user
account is modified or deleted. If not specified, a
compile-time default is used.</p>

<p>MAIL_FILE (string) Defines the location of the users
mail spool files relatively to their home directory.</p>

<p>The MAIL_DIR and MAIL_FILE variables are used by
useradd, usermod, and userdel to create, move, or delete the
user&acute;s mail spool.</p>

<p>If MAIL_CHECK_ENAB is set to yes, they are also used to
define the MAIL environment variable.</p>

<p>MAX_MEMBERS_PER_GROUP (number) Maximum members per group
entry. When the maximum is reached, a new group entry (line)
is started in /etc/group (with the same name, same password,
and same GID).</p>

<p>The default value is 0, meaning that there are no limits
in the number of members in a group.</p>

<p>This feature (split group) permits to limit the length
of lines in the group file. This is useful to make sure that
lines for NIS groups are not larger than 1024
characters.</p>

<p>If you need to enforce such limit, you can use 25.</p>

<p>Note: split groups may not be supported by all tools
(even in the Shadow toolsuite). You should not use this
variable unless you really need it.</p>

<p>USERDEL_CMD (string) If defined, this command is run
when removing a user. It should remove any at/cron/print
jobs etc. owned by the user to be removed (passed as the
first argument).</p>

<p>The return code of the script is not taken into
account.</p>

<p>Here is an example script, which removes the
user&acute;s cron, at and print jobs:</p>

<p>#! /bin/sh</p>

<p># Check for the required argument. if [ $# != 1 ]; then
echo &quot;Usage: $0 username&quot; exit 1 fi</p>

<p># Remove cron jobs. crontab -r -u $1</p>

<p># Remove at jobs. # Note that it will remove any jobs
owned by the same UID, # even if it was shared by a
different username. AT_SPOOL_DIR=/var/spool/cron/atjobs find
$AT_SPOOL_DIR -name &quot;[^.]*&quot; -type f -user $1
-delete ;</p>

<p># Remove print jobs. lprm $1</p>

<p># All done. exit 0</p>

<p>USERGROUPS_ENAB (boolean) Enable setting of the umask
group bits to be the same as owner bits (examples: 022 -&gt;
002, 077 -&gt; 007) for non-root users, if the uid is the
same as gid, and username is the same as the primary group
name.</p>

<p>If set to yes, userdel will remove the user&acute;s
group if it contains no more members, and useradd will
create by default a group with the name of the user.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/group Group account information.</p>

<p>/etc/login.defs Shadow password suite configuration.</p>

<p>/etc/passwd User account information.</p>

<p>/etc/shadow Secure user account information.</p>

<p>EXIT VALUES The userdel command exits with the following
values:</p>

<p>0 success</p>

<p>1 can&acute;t update password file</p>

<p>2 invalid command syntax</p>

<p>6 specified user doesn&acute;t exist</p>

<p>8 user currently logged in</p>

<p>10 can&acute;t update group file</p>

<p>12 can&acute;t remove home directory</p>

<p>CAVEATS userdel will not allow you to remove an account
if there are running processes which belong to this account.
In that case, you may have to kill those processes or lock
the user&acute;s password or account and remove the account
later. The -f option can force the deletion of this
account.</p>

<p>You should manually check all file systems to ensure
that no files remain owned by this user.</p>

<p>You may not remove any NIS attributes on a NIS client.
This must be performed on the NIS server.</p>

<p>If USERGROUPS_ENAB is defined to yes in /etc/login.defs,
userdel will delete the group with the same name as the
user. To avoid inconsistencies in the passwd and group
databases, userdel will check that this group is not used as
a primary group for another user, and will just warn without
deleting the group otherwise. The -f option can force the
deletion of this group.</p>
