<p>NAME stapgraph - systemtap grapher</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS stapgraph [ OPTIONS ] FILENAME [ ARGUMENTS ]
stapgraph [ OPTIONS ] - [ ARGUMENTS ] stapgraph [ OPTIONS ]
-e SCRIPT [ ARGUMENTS ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The stapgraph program is a simple frontend
to stap that produces graphs from the output of stap
scripts.</p>

<p>This manual corresponds to version 1.2.</p>

<p>OPTIONS stapgraph accepts all options accepted by stap.
They are passed through to the stap process running the
script or probe points.</p>

<p>USER INTERFACE The script that produces results can be
started from a dialog within the program, in addition to
being launched using the programs command line arguments.
This dialog allows arguments to be passed to stap and to the
script.</p>

<p>When running, a mouse left click on a graph pauses the
display of data, even though it is still collected by the
program. Dragging the mouse scrolls the graph backwards and
forwards in time; clicking the dis- played pause button
restarts the display of new data.</p>

<p>The scroll wheel can be used to zoom in and out on the
graph.</p>

<p>SCRIPT OUTPUT SYNTAX Scripts can output Comma Seperated
Values (CSV) which will be inter- preted by stapgraph. The
first value is the X coordinate of the graph, usually a time
value. stapgraph assumes that this value is constantly
increasing.</p>

<p>A different syntax allows the script to specify many
details of the graphs appearance.</p>

<p>%DataSet: DATA-SET-NAME SCALE COLOR GRAPHSTYLE</p>

<p>The data set name identifies a data set that will be
emitted by the script. &quot;SCALE&quot; is the overall
vertical scale of the graph for this data set.
&quot;COLOR&quot; is a red-green-blue hex color.
&quot;GRAPHSTYLE&quot; is one of bar - a traditional bar
graph dot - plotted points discreet - An event style
timeline that records that an event happened at a certain
time.</p>

<p>%Title: TITLE A title for the whole graph.</p>

<p>%XAxisTitle: TITLE The legend for the X axis</p>

<p>%YAxisTitle: TITLE The legend for the Y axis.</p>

<p>%YMax: MAX VALUE The maximum value displayed on the
graph.</p>

<p>GRAPH DATA DATA SET TIME VALUE Each data point that is
to be plotted is tagged with the data set name, followed by
the time and value of the point.</p>
