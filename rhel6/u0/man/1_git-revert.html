<p>GIT-REVERT(1) Git Manual GIT-REVERT(1)</p>

<p>NAME git-revert - Revert an existing commit</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS git revert [--edit | --no-edit] [-n] [-m
parent-number] [-s] &lt;commit&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Given one existing commit, revert the change
the patch introduces, and record a new commit that records
it. This requires your working tree to be clean (no
modifications from the HEAD commit).</p>

<p>Note: git revert is used to record a new commit to
reverse the effect of an earlier commit (often a faulty
one). If you want to throw away all uncommitted changes in
your working directory, you should see git- reset(1),
particularly the --hard option. If you want to extract
specific files as they were in another commit, you should
see git- checkout(1), specifically the git checkout
&lt;commit&gt; &lt;filename&gt; syntax. Take care with these
alternatives as both will discard uncommitted changes in
your working directory.</p>

<p>OPTIONS &lt;commit&gt; Commit to revert. For a more
complete list of ways to spell commit names, see
&quot;SPECIFYING REVISIONS&quot; section in
git-rev-parse(1).</p>

<p>-e, --edit With this option, git revert will let you
edit the commit message prior to committing the revert. This
is the default if you run the command from a terminal.</p>

<p>-m parent-number, --mainline parent-number Usually you
cannot revert a merge because you do not know which side of
the merge should be considered the mainline. This option
specifies the parent number (starting from 1) of the
mainline and allows revert to reverse the change relative to
the specified parent.</p>

<p>Reverting a merge commit declares that you will never
want the tree changes brought in by the merge. As a result,
later merges will only bring in tree changes introduced by
commits that are not ancestors of the previously reverted
merge. This may or may not be what you want.</p>

<p>See the revert-a-faulty-merge How-To[1] for more
details.</p>

<p>--no-edit With this option, git revert will not start
the commit message editor.</p>

<p>-n, --no-commit Usually the command automatically
creates a commit with a commit log message stating which
commit was reverted. This flag applies the change necessary
to revert the named commit to your working tree and the
index, but does not make the commit. In addition, when this
option is used, your index does not have to match the HEAD
commit. The revert is done against the beginning state of
your index.</p>

<p>This is useful when reverting more than one
commits&acute; effect to your index in a row.</p>

<p>-s, --signoff Add Signed-off-by line at the end of the
commit message.</p>
