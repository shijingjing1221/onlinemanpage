<p>Tcl_Panic(3) Tcl Library Procedures Tcl_Panic(3)</p>


<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME Tcl_Panic, Tcl_PanicVA, Tcl_SetPanicProc - report
fatal error and abort</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tcl.h&gt;</p>

<p>void Tcl_Panic(format, arg, arg, ...)</p>

<p>void Tcl_PanicVA(format, argList)</p>

<p>void Tcl_SetPanicProc(panicProc)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS const char* format (in) A printf-style format
string.</p>

<p>arg (in) Arguments matching the format string.</p>

<p>va_list argList (in) An argument list of arguments
matching the format string. Must have been initialized using
va_start, and cleared using va_end.</p>

<p>Tcl_PanicProc *panicProc (in) Procedure to report fatal
error message and abort.</p>


<p>_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION When the Tcl library detects that its
internal data structures are in an inconsistent state, or
that its C procedures have been called in a manner
inconsistent with their documentation, it calls Tcl_Panic to
display a message describing the error and abort the
process. The for- mat argument is a format string describing
how to format the remaining arguments arg into an error
message, according to the same formatting rules used by the
printf family of functions. The same formatting rules are
also used by the built-in Tcl command format.</p>

<p>In a freshly loaded Tcl library, Tcl_Panic prints the
formatted error message to the standard error file of the
process, and then calls abort to terminate the process.
Tcl_Panic does not return.</p>

<p>Tcl_SetPanicProc may be used to modify the behavior of
Tcl_Panic. The panicProc argument should match the type
Tcl_PanicProc:</p>

<p>typedef void Tcl_PanicProc( const char *format, arg,
arg,...);</p>

<p>After Tcl_SetPanicProc returns, any future calls to
Tcl_Panic will call panicProc, passing along the format and
arg arguments. To maintain consistency with the callers of
Tcl_Panic, panicProc must not return; it must call abort.
panicProc should avoid making calls into the Tcl library, or
into other libraries that may call the Tcl library, since
the original call to Tcl_Panic indicates the Tcl library is
not in a state of reliable operation.</p>

<p>The typical use of Tcl_SetPanicProc arranges for the
error message to be displayed or reported in a manner more
suitable for the application or the platform. As an example,
the Windows implementation of wish calls Tcl_SetPanicProc to
force all panic messages to be displayed in a system dialog
box, rather than to be printed to the standard error file
(usually not visible under Windows).</p>

<p>Although the primary callers of Tcl_Panic are the
procedures of the Tcl library, Tcl_Panic is a public
function and may be called by any exten- sion or application
that wishes to abort the process and have a panic message
displayed the same way that panic messages from Tcl will be
displayed.</p>

<p>Tcl_PanicVA is the same as Tcl_Panic except that instead
of taking a variable number of arguments it takes an
argument list.</p>
