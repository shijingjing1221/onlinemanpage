<p>PAM_TTY_AUDIT(8) Linux-PAM Manual PAM_TTY_AUDIT(8)</p>

<p>NAME pam_tty_audit - Enable or disable TTY auditing for
specified users</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pam_tty_audit.so [disable=patterns]
[enable=patterns]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pam_tty_audit PAM module is used to
enable or disable TTY auditing. By default, the kernel does
not audit input on any TTY.</p>

<p>OPTIONS disable=patterns For each user matching one of
comma-separated glob patterns, disable TTY auditing. This
overrides any previous enable option matching the same user
name on the command line.</p>

<p>enable=patterns For each user matching one of
comma-separated glob patterns, enable TTY auditing. This
overrides any previous disable option matching the same user
name on the command line.</p>

<p>open_only Set the TTY audit flag when opening the
session, but do not restore it when closing the session.
Using this option is necessary for some services that
don&acute;t fork() to run the authenticated session, such as
sudo.</p>

<p>MODULE TYPES PROVIDED Only the session type is
supported.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUES PAM_SESSION_ERR Error reading or modifying
the TTY audit flag. See the system log for more details.</p>

<p>PAM_SUCCESS Success.</p>

<p>NOTES When TTY auditing is enabled, it is inherited by
all processes started by that user. In particular, daemons
restarted by an user will still have TTY auditing enabled,
and audit TTY input even by other users unless auditing for
these users is explicitly disabled. Therefore, it is
recommended to use disable=* as the first option for most
daemons using PAM.</p>

<p>To view the data that was logged by the kernel to audit
use the command aureport --tty.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Audit all administrative actions.</p>

<p>session required pam_tty_audit.so disable=*
enable=root</p>
