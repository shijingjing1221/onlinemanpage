<p>BLOCK_INVALIDATEPAGE(9) The Linux VFS
BLOCK_INVALIDATEPAGE(9)</p>

<p>NAME block_invalidatepage - invalidate part of all of a
buffer-backed page</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS void block_invalidatepage(struct page * page,
unsigned long offset);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS page the page which is affected</p>

<p>offset the index of the truncation point</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION block_invalidatepage is called when all or
part of the page has become invalidatedby a truncate
operation.</p>

<p>block_invalidatepage does not have to release all
buffers, but it must ensure that no dirty buffer is left
outside offset and that no I/O is underway against any of
the blocks which are outside the truncation point. Because
the caller is about to free (and possibly reuse) those
blocks on-disk.</p>
