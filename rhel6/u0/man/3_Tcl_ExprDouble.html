<p>Tcl_ExprLong(3) Tcl Library Procedures
Tcl_ExprLong(3)</p>


<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME Tcl_ExprLong, Tcl_ExprDouble, Tcl_ExprBoolean,
Tcl_ExprString - evalu- ate an expression</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tcl.h&gt;</p>

<p>int Tcl_ExprLong(interp, expr, longPtr)</p>

<p>int Tcl_ExprDouble(interp, expr, doublePtr)</p>

<p>int Tcl_ExprBoolean(interp, expr, booleanPtr)</p>

<p>int Tcl_ExprString(interp, expr)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS Tcl_Interp *interp (in) Interpreter in whose
context to evaluate expr.</p>

<p>const char *expr (in) Expression to be evaluated.</p>

<p>long *longPtr (out) Pointer to location in which to
store the integer value of the expression.</p>

<p>int *doublePtr (out) Pointer to location in which to
store the floating-point value of the expression.</p>

<p>int *booleanPtr (out) Pointer to location in which to
store the 0/1 boolean value of the expression.

<p>DESCRIPTION These four procedures all evaluate the
expression given by the expr argument and return the result
in one of four different forms. The expression can have any
of the forms accepted by the expr command. Note that these
procedures have been largely replaced by the object- based
procedures Tcl_ExprLongObj, Tcl_ExprDoubleObj, Tcl_Expr-
BooleanObj, and Tcl_ExprObj. Those object-based procedures
evaluate an expression held in a Tcl object instead of a
string. The object argu- ment can retain an internal
representation that is more efficient to execute.</p>

<p>The interp argument refers to an interpreter used to
evaluate the expression (e.g. for variables and nested Tcl
commands) and to return error information.</p>

<p>For all of these procedures the return value is a
standard Tcl result: TCL_OK means the expression was
successfully evaluated, and TCL_ERROR means that an error
occurred while evaluating the expression. If TCL_ERROR is
returned then the interpreters result will hold a message
describing the error. If an error occurs while executing a
Tcl command embedded in the expression then that error will
be returned.</p>

<p>If the expression is successfully evaluated, then its
value is returned in one of four forms, depending on which
procedure is invoked. Tcl_ExprLong stores an integer value
at *longPtr. If the expressions actual value is a
floating-point number, then it is truncated to an integer.
If the expressions actual value is a non-numeric string then
an error is returned.</p>

<p>Tcl_ExprDouble stores a floating-point value at
*doublePtr. If the expressions actual value is an integer,
it is converted to floating- point. If the expressions
actual value is a non-numeric string then an error is
returned.</p>

<p>Tcl_ExprBoolean stores a 0/1 integer value at
*booleanPtr. If the expression s actual value is an integer
or floating-point number, then they store 0 at *booleanPtr
if the value was zero and 1 otherwise. If the expression s
actual value is a non-numeric string then it must be one of
the values accepted by Tcl_GetBoolean such as yes or no, or
else an error occurs.</p>

<p>Tcl_ExprString returns the value of the expression as a
string stored in the interpreters result.</p>
