<p>NAME passwd - update users authentication tokens</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS passwd [-k] [-l] [-u [-f]] [-d] [-n mindays]
[-x maxdays] [-w warndays] [-i inactivedays] [-S] [--stdin]
[username]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The passwd utility is used to update users
authentication token(s).</p>

<p>This task is achieved through calls to the Linux-PAM and
Libuser API. Essentially, it initializes itself as a
&quot;passwd&quot; service with Linux-PAM and utilizes
configured password modules to authenticate and then update
a users password.</p>

<p>A simple entry in the global Linux-PAM configuration
file for this ser- vice would be:</p>

<p># # passwd service entry that does strength checking of
# a proposed password before updating it. # passwd password
requisite pam_cracklib.so retry=3 passwd password required
pam_unix.so use_authtok #</p>

<p>Note, other module types are not required for this
application to func- tion correctly.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -k The option -k, is used to indicate that the
update should only be for expired authentication tokens
(passwords); the user wishes to keep their non-expired
tokens as before.</p>

<p>-l This option is used to lock the specified account and
it is available to root only. The locking is performed by
rendering the encrypted password into an invalid string (by
prefixing the encrypted string with an !).</p>

<p>--stdin This option is used to indicate that passwd
should read the new password from standard input, which can
be a pipe.</p>

<p>-u This is the reverse of the -l option - it will unlock
the account password by removing the ! prefix. This option
is avail- able to root only. By default passwd will refuse
to create a passwordless account (it will not unlock an
account that has only &quot;!&quot; as a password). The
force option -f will override this protection.</p>

<p>-d This is a quick way to delete a password for an
account. It will set the named account passwordless.
Available to root only.</p>

<p>-n This will set the minimum password lifetime, in days,
if the user s account supports password lifetimes. Available
to root only.</p>

<p>-x This will set the maximum password lifetime, in days,
if the user s account supports password lifetimes. Available
to root only.</p>

<p>-w This will set the number of days in advance the user
will begin receiving warnings that her password will expire,
if the users account supports password lifetimes. Available
to root only.</p>

<p>-i This will set the number of days which will pass
before an expired password for this account will be taken to
mean that the account is inactive and should be disabled, if
the users account supports password lifetimes. Available to
root only.</p>

<p>-S This will output a short information about the status
of the password for a given account. Available to root user
only.</p>

<p>Remember the following two principles Protect your
password. Dont write down your password - memorize it. In
particular, dont write it down and leave it anywhere, and
don t place it in an unencrypted file! Use unrelated
passwords for systems con- trolled by different
organizations. Dont give or share your password, in
particular to someone claiming to be from computer support
or a vendor. Dont let anyone watch you enter your password.
Don t enter your password to a computer you dont trust or if
things Use the password for a limited time and change it
periodically.</p>

<p>Choose a hard-to-guess password. passwd through the
calls to the pam_cracklib PAM module will try to prevent you
from choosing a really bad password, but it isnt foolproof;
create your password wisely. Dont use something youd find in
a dictionary (in any language or jargon). Dont use a name
(including that of a spouse, parent, child, pet, fan- tasy
character, famous person, and location) or any variation of
your personal or account name. Dont use accessible
information about you (such as your phone number, license
plate, or social security number) or your environment. Dont
use a birthday or a simple pattern (such as backwards,
followed by a digit, or pre- ceded by a digit. Instead, use
a mixture of upper and lower case letters, as well as digits
or punctuation. When choosing a new password, make sure its
unrelated to any previous password. Use long passwords (say
at least 8 characters long). You might use a word pair with
punctuation inserted, a passphrase (an under- standable
sequence of words), or the first letter of each word in a
passphrase.</p>

<p>These principles are partially enforced by the system,
but only partly so. Vigilence on your part will make the
system much more secure.</p>

<p>EXIT CODE On successful completion of its task, passwd
will complete with exit code 0. An exit code of 1 indicates
an error occurred. Textual errors are written to the
standard error stream.</p>
