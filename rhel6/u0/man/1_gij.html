<p>GIJ(1) GNU GIJ(1)</p>

<p>NAME gij - GNU interpreter for Java bytecode</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS gij [OPTION] ... JARFILE [ARGS...]</p>

<p>gij [-jar] [OPTION] ... CLASS [ARGS...] [-cp path]
[-classpath path] [-Dname[=value]...] [-ms=number]
[-mx=number] [-Xargument] [-verbose] [-verbose:class]
[--showversion] [--version] [--help][-?]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION &quot;gij&quot; is a Java bytecode
interpreter included with &quot;libgcj&quot;.
&quot;gij&quot; is not available on every platform; porting
it requires a small amount of assembly programming which has
not been done for all the targets supported by gcj.</p>

<p>The primary argument to &quot;gij&quot; is the name of a
class or, with &quot;-jar&quot;, a jar file. Options before
this argument are interpreted by &quot;gij&quot;; remaining
options are passed to the interpreted program.</p>

<p>If a class name is specified and this class does not
have a &quot;main&quot; method with the appropriate
signature (a &quot;static void&quot; method with a
&quot;String[]&quot; as its sole argument), then
&quot;gij&quot; will print an error and exit.</p>

<p>If a jar file is specified then &quot;gij&quot; will use
information in it to determine which class &quot;main&quot;
method will be invoked.</p>

<p>&quot;gij&quot; will invoke the &quot;main&quot; method
with all the remaining command-line options.</p>

<p>Note that &quot;gij&quot; is not limited to interpreting
code. Because &quot;libgcj&quot; includes a class loader
which can dynamically load shared objects, it is possible to
give &quot;gij&quot; the name of a class which has been
compiled and put into a shared library on the class
path.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -cp path -classpath path Set the initial class
path. The class path is used for finding class and resource
files. If specified, this option overrides the
&quot;CLASSPATH&quot; environment variable. Note that this
option is ignored if &quot;-jar&quot; is used.</p>

<p>-Dname[=value] This defines a system property named name
with value value. If value is not specified then it defaults
to the empty string. These system properties are initialized
at the program s startup and can be retrieved at runtime
using the &quot;java.lang.System.getProperty&quot;
method.</p>

<p>-ms=number Equivalent to &quot;-Xms&quot;.</p>

<p>-mx=number Equivalent to &quot;-Xmx&quot;.</p>

<p>-noverify Do not verify compliance of bytecode with the
VM specification. In addition, this option disables type
verification which is otherwise performed on BC-ABI compiled
code.</p>

<p>-X -Xargument Supplying &quot;-X&quot; by itself will
cause &quot;gij&quot; to list all the supported
&quot;-X&quot; options. Currently these options are
supported:</p>

<p>-Xmssize Set the initial heap size.</p>

<p>-Xmxsize Set the maximum heap size.</p>

<p>-Xsssize Set the thread stack size.</p>

<p>Unrecognized &quot;-X&quot; options are ignored, for
compatibility with other runtimes.</p>

<p>-jar This indicates that the name passed to
&quot;gij&quot; should be interpreted as the name of a jar
file, not a class.</p>

<p>--help -? Print help, then exit.</p>

<p>--showversion Print version number and continue.</p>

<p>--fullversion Print detailed version information, then
exit.</p>

<p>--version Print version number, then exit.</p>

<p>-verbose -verbose:class Each time a class is
initialized, print a short message on standard error.</p>

<p>&quot;gij&quot; also recognizes and ignores the
following options, for compatibility with existing
application launch scripts: &quot;-client&quot;,
&quot;-server&quot;, &quot;-hotspot&quot;,
&quot;-jrockit&quot;, &quot;-agentlib&quot;,
&quot;-agentpath&quot;, &quot;-debug&quot;,
&quot;-d32&quot;, &quot;-d64&quot;, &quot;-javaagent&quot;,
&quot;-noclassgc&quot;, &quot;-verify&quot;, and
&quot;-verifyremote&quot;.</p>
