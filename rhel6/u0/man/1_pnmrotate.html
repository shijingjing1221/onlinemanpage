<p>NAME pnmrotate - rotate a PNM image by some angle</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pnmrotate [-noantialias] [-background=color]
angle [pnmfile]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pnmrotate reads a PNM image as input. It rotates it by
the specified angle and produces the same kind of PNM image
as output.</p>

<p>The input is the file named by pnmfile or Standard Input
if you dont specify pnmfile. The output goes to Standard
Output.</p>

<p>The resulting image is a rectangle that contains the
(rectangular) input image within it, rotated with respect to
its bottom edge. The containing rectangle is as small as
possible to contain the rotated image. The background of the
containing image is a single color that pnmrotate determines
to be the background color of the original image, or that
you specify explicitly.</p>

<p>angle is in decimal degrees (floating point), measured
counter-clock- wise. It can be negative, but it should be
between -90 and 90.</p>

<p>You should use pamflip instead for rotations that are a
multiple of a quarter turn. It is faster and more
accurate.</p>

<p>For rotations greater than 45 degrees you may get better
results if you first use pamflip to do a 90 degree rotation
and then pnmrotate less than 45 degrees back the other
direction.</p>

<p>The rotation algorithm is Alan Paeths three-shear
method. Each shear is implemented by looping over the source
pixels and distributing frac- tions to each of the
destination pixels. This has an anti-aliasing effect - it
avoids jagged edges and similar artifacts. However, it also
means that the original colors or gray levels in the image
are modified. If you need to keep precisely the same set of
colors, you can use the -noantialias option.</p>

<p>The program runs faster and uses less real memory with
the -noantialias option. It uses a large amount of virtual
memory either way, as it keeps a copy of the input image and
a copy of the output image in mem- ory, using 12 bytes per
pixel for each. But with -noantialias, it accesses this
memory sequentially in half a dozen passes, with only a few
pages of memory at a time required in real memory.</p>

<p>In contrast, without -noantialias, the program s real
memory working set size is one page per input image row plus
one page per output image row. Before Netpbm 10.16 (June
2003), -noantialias had the same memory requirement.</p>

<p>OPTIONS All options can be abbreviated to their shortest
unique prefix. You may use two hyphens instead of one to
designate an option. You may use either white space or
equals signs between an option name and its value.</p>

<p>-background=color This determines the color of the
background on which the rotated image sits.</p>

<p>Specify the color (color) as described for the argument
of the ppm_parsecolor() library routine .</p>

<p>By default, if you don t specify this option, pnmrotate
selects what appears to it to be the background color of the
original image. It determines this color rather
simplisticly, by taking an average of the colors of the two
top corners of the image.</p>

<p>This option was new in Netpbm 10.15. Before that,
pnmrotate always behaved as is the default now.</p>

<p>-noantialias This option forces pnmrotate to simply move
pixels around instead of synthesizing output pixels from
multiple input pix- els. The latter could cause the output
to contain colors that are not in the input, which may not
be desirable. It also prob- ably makes the output contain a
large number of colors. If you need a small number of
colors, but it doesnt matter if they are the exact ones from
the input, consider using pnmquant on the output instead of
using -noantialias.</p>

<p>Note that to ensure the output does not contain colors
that are not in the input, you also must consider the
background color. See the -background option.</p>
