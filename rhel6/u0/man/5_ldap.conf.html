<p>LDAP.CONF(5) LDAP.CONF(5)</p>

<p>NAME ldap.conf, .ldaprc - LDAP configuration
file/environment variables</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS /etc/openldap/ldap.conf, ldaprc, .ldaprc,
$LDAP&lt;option-name&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION If the environment variable LDAPNOINIT is
defined, all defaulting is disabled.</p>

<p>The ldap.conf configuration file is used to set
system-wide defaults to be applied when running ldap
clients.</p>

<p>Users may create an optional configuration file, ldaprc
or .ldaprc, in their home directory which will be used to
override the system-wide defaults file. The file ldaprc in
the current working directory is also used.</p>

<p>Additional configuration files can be specified using
the LDAPCONF and LDAPRC environment variables. LDAPCONF may
be set to the path of a configuration file. This path can be
absolute or relative to the cur- rent working directory. The
LDAPRC, if defined, should be the basename of a file in the
current working directory or in the users home direc-
tory.</p>

<p>Environmental variables may also be used to augment the
file based defaults. The name of the variable is the option
name with an added prefix of LDAP. For example, to define
BASE via the environment, set the variable LDAPBASE to the
desired value.</p>

<p>Some options are user-only. Such options are ignored if
present in the ldap.conf (or file specified by
LDAPCONF).</p>

<p>Thus the following files and variables are read, in
order: variable $LDAPNOINIT, and if that is not set: system
file /etc/openldap/ldap.conf, user files $HOME/ldaprc,
$HOME/.ldaprc, ./ldaprc, system file $LDAPCONF, user files
$HOME/$LDAPRC, $HOME/.$LDAPRC, ./$LDAPRC, variables
$LDAP&lt;option-name&gt;. Settings late in the list override
earlier ones.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The configuration options are case-insensitive;
their value, on a case by case basis, may be
case-sensitive.</p>

<p>Blank lines and lines beginning with a hash mark (#) are
ignored up to their end.</p>

<p>Valid lines are made of an options name (a sequence of
non-blanks, conventionally written in uppercase, although
not required), followed by a value. The value starts with
the first non-blank character after the options name, and
terminates at the end of the line, or at the last sequence
of blanks before the end of the line. The tokenization of
the value, if any, is delegated to the handler(s) for that
option, if any. Quoting values that contain blanks may be
incorrect, as the quotes would become part of the value. For
example,</p>

<p>URI &quot;ldap:// ldaps://&quot;</p>

<p>is incorrect, while</p>

<p>URI ldap:// ldaps://</p>

<p>is correct (note the absence of the double quotes).</p>

<p>A line cannot be longer than LINE_MAX, which should be
more than 2000 bytes on all platforms. There is no mechanism
to split a long line on multiple lines, either for
beautification or to overcome the above limit.</p>

<p>The different configuration options are:</p>

<p>URI &lt;ldap[si]://[name[:port]] ...&gt; Specifies the
URI(s) of an LDAP server(s) to which the LDAP library should
connect. The URI scheme may be any of ldap, ldaps or ldapi,
which refer to LDAP over TCP, LDAP over SSL (TLS) and LDAP
over IPC (UNIX domain sockets), respectively. Each server s
name can be specified as a domain-style name or an IP
address literal. Optionally, the servers name can followed
by a : and the port number the LDAP server is listening on.
If no port number is provided, the default port for the
scheme is used (389 for ldap://, 636 for ldaps://). For LDAP
over IPC, name is the name of the socket, and no port is
required, nor allowed; note that directory separators must
be URL-encoded, like any other characters that are special
to URLs; so the socket</p>

<p>/usr/local/var/ldapi</p>

<p>must be specified as</p>

<p>ldapi://%2Fusr%2Flocal%2Fvar%2Fldapi</p>

<p>A space separated list of URIs may be provided.</p>

<p>BASE &lt;base&gt; Specifies the default base DN to use
when performing ldap opera- tions. The base must be
specified as a Distinguished Name in LDAP format.</p>

<p>BINDDN &lt;dn&gt; Specifies the default bind DN to use
when performing ldap opera- tions. The bind DN must be
specified as a Distinguished Name in LDAP format. This is a
user-only option.</p>

<p>DEREF &lt;when&gt; Specifies how alias dereferencing is
done when performing a search. The &lt;when&gt; can be
specified as one of the following key- words:</p>

<p>never Aliases are never dereferenced. This is the
default.</p>

<p>searching Aliases are dereferenced in subordinates of
the base object, but not in locating the base object of the
search.</p>

<p>finding Aliases are only dereferenced when locating the
base object of the search.</p>

<p>always Aliases are dereferenced both in searching and in
locat- ing the base object of the search.</p>

<p>HOST &lt;name[:port] ...&gt; Specifies the name(s) of an
LDAP server(s) to which the LDAP library should connect.
Each server s name can be specified as a domain-style name
or an IP address and optionally followed by a : and the port
number the ldap server is listening on. A space separated
list of hosts may be provided. HOST is deprecated in favor
of URI.</p>

<p>NETWORK_TIMEOUT &lt;integer&gt; Specifies the timeout
(in seconds) after which the poll(2)/select(2) following a
connect(2) returns in case of no activity.</p>

<p>PORT &lt;port&gt; Specifies the default port used when
connecting to LDAP servers(s). The port may be specified as
a number. PORT is deprecated in favor of URI.</p>

<p>REFERRALS &lt;on/true/yes/off/false/no&gt; Specifies if
the client should automatically follow referrals returned by
LDAP servers. The default is on. Note that the command line
tools ldapsearch(1) &amp;co always override this option.</p>

<p>SIZELIMIT &lt;integer&gt; Specifies a size limit (number
of entries) to use when performing searches. The number
should be a non-negative integer. SIZELIMIT of zero (0)
specifies a request for unlimited search size. Please note
that the server may still apply any server-side limit on the
amount of entries that can be returned by a search
operation.</p>

<p>TIMELIMIT &lt;integer&gt; Specifies a time limit (in
seconds) to use when perform- ing searches. The number
should be a non-negative inte- ger. TIMELIMIT of zero (0)
specifies unlimited search time to be used. Please note that
the server may still apply any server-side limit on the
duration of a search operation. VERSION {2|3} Specifies what
version of the LDAP protocol should be used.</p>

<p>TIMEOUT &lt;integer&gt; Specifies a timeout (in seconds)
after which calls to synchronous LDAP APIs will abort if no
response is received. Also used for any ldap_result(3) calls
where a NULL timeout parameter is supplied.</p>

<p>SASL OPTIONS If OpenLDAP is built with Simple
Authentication and Security Layer support, there are more
options you can specify.</p>

<p>SASL_MECH &lt;mechanism&gt; Specifies the SASL mechanism
to use. This is a user-only option.</p>

<p>SASL_REALM &lt;realm&gt; Specifies the SASL realm. This
is a user-only option.</p>

<p>SASL_AUTHCID &lt;authcid&gt; Specifies the
authentication identity. This is a user- only option.</p>

<p>SASL_AUTHZID &lt;authcid&gt; Specifies the proxy
authorization identity. This is a user-only option.</p>

<p>SASL_SECPROPS &lt;properties&gt; Specifies Cyrus SASL
security properties. The &lt;proper- ties&gt; can be
specified as a comma-separated list of the following:</p>

<p>none (without any other properties) causes the proper-
ties defaults (&quot;noanonymous,noplain&quot;) to be
cleared.</p>

<p>noplain disables mechanisms susceptible to simple
passive attacks.</p>

<p>noactive disables mechanisms susceptible to active
attacks.</p>

<p>nodict disables mechanisms susceptible to passive
dictio- nary attacks.</p>

<p>noanonymous disables mechanisms which support anonymous
login.</p>

<p>forwardsec requires forward secrecy between
sessions.</p>

<p>passcred requires mechanisms which pass client
credentials (and allows mechanisms which can pass
credentials to do so).</p>

<p>minssf=&lt;factor&gt; specifies the minimum acceptable
security strength factor as an integer approximating the
effective key length used for encryption. 0 (zero) implies
no protection, 1 implies integrity protection only, 56
allows DES or other weak ciphers, 112 allows triple DES and
other strong ciphers, 128 allows RC4, Blowfish and other
modern strong ciphers. The default is 0.</p>

<p>maxssf=&lt;factor&gt; specifies the maximum acceptable
security strength factor as an integer (see minssf
description). The default is INT_MAX.</p>

<p>maxbufsize=&lt;factor&gt; specifies the maximum security
layer receive buffer size allowed. 0 disables security
layers. The default is 65536.</p>

<p>GSSAPI OPTIONS If OpenLDAP is built with Generic
Security Services Application Programming Interface support,
there are more options you can specify.</p>

<p>GSSAPI_SIGN &lt;on/true/yes/off/false/no&gt; Specifies
if GSSAPI signing (GSS_C_INTEG_FLAG) should be used. The
default is off.</p>

<p>GSSAPI_ENCRYPT &lt;on/true/yes/off/false/no&gt;
Specifies if GSSAPI encryption (GSS_C_INTEG_FLAG and
GSS_C_CONF_FLAG) should be used. The default is off.</p>

<p>GSSAPI_ALLOW_REMOTE_PRINCIPAL
&lt;on/true/yes/off/false/no&gt; Specifies if GSSAPI based
authentification should try to form the target principal
name out of the ldapServiceName or dnsHostName attribute of
the targets RootDSE entry. The default is off.</p>

<p>TLS OPTIONS If OpenLDAP is built with Transport Layer
Security support, there are more options you can specify.
These options are used when an ldaps:// URI is selected (by
default or otherwise) or when the application negotiates TLS
by issuing the LDAP StartTLS operation.</p>

<p>TLS_CACERT &lt;filename&gt; Specifies the file that
contains certificates for all of the Certificate Authorities
the client will recognize.</p>

<p>TLS_CACERTDIR &lt;path&gt; Specifies the path of a
directory that contains Certifi- cate Authority certificates
in separate individual files. The TLS_CACERT is always used
before TLS_CACERTDIR. The specified directory must be
managed with the OpenSSL c_rehash utility. This parameter is
ignored with GNUtls.</p>

<p>TLS_CERT &lt;filename&gt; Specifies the file that
contains the client certificate. This is a user-only
option.</p>

<p>TLS_KEY &lt;filename&gt; Specifies the file that
contains the private key that matches the certificate stored
in the TLS_CERT file. Cur- rently, the private key must not
be protected with a password, so it is of critical
importance that the key file is protected carefully. This is
a user-only option.</p>

<p>TLS_CIPHER_SUITE &lt;cipher-suite-spec&gt; Specifies
acceptable cipher suite and preference order.
&lt;cipher-suite-spec&gt; should be a cipher specification
for OpenSSL, e.g., HIGH:MEDIUM:+SSLv2.</p>

<p>To check what ciphers a given spec selects, use:</p>

<p>openssl ciphers -v &lt;cipher-suite-spec&gt;</p>

<p>To obtain the list of ciphers in GNUtls use:</p>

<p>gnutls-cli -l</p>

<p>TLS_RANDFILE &lt;filename&gt; Specifies the file to
obtain random bits from when /dev/[u]random is not
available. Generally set to the name of the EGD/PRNGD
socket. The environment variable RANDFILE can also be used
to specify the filename. This parameter is ignored with
GNUtls.</p>

<p>TLS_REQCERT &lt;level&gt; Specifies what checks to
perform on server certificates in a TLS session, if any. The
&lt;level&gt; can be specified as one of the following
keywords:</p>

<p>never The client will not request or check any server
certificate.</p>

<p>allow The server certificate is requested. If no cer-
tificate is provided, the session proceeds nor- mally. If a
bad certificate is provided, it will be ignored and the
session proceeds normally.</p>

<p>try The server certificate is requested. If no cer-
tificate is provided, the session proceeds nor- mally. If a
bad certificate is provided, the ses- sion is immediately
terminated.</p>

<p>demand | hard These keywords are equivalent. The server
certifi- cate is requested. If no certificate is provided,
or a bad certificate is provided, the session is immediately
terminated. This is the default setting.</p>

<p>TLS_CRLCHECK &lt;level&gt; Specifies if the Certificate
Revocation List (CRL) of the CA should be used to verify if
the server certificates have not been revoked. This requires
TLS_CACERTDIR param- eter to be set. This parameter is
ignored with GNUtls. &lt;level&gt; can be specified as one
of the following key- words:</p>

<p>none No CRL checks are performed</p>

<p>peer Check the CRL of the peer certificate</p>

<p>all Check the CRL for a whole certificate chain</p>

<p>TLS_CRLFILE &lt;filename&gt; Specifies the file
containing a Certificate Revocation List to be used to
verify if the server certificates have not been revoked.
This parameter is only supported with GNUtls.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES LDAPNOINIT disable all
defaulting</p>

<p>LDAPCONF path of a configuration file</p>

<p>LDAPRC basename of ldaprc file in $HOME or $CWD</p>
