<p>NAME vsnprintf - Format a string and place it in a
buffer</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS int vsnprintf(char * buf, size_t size, const
char * fmt, va_list args);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS buf The buffer to place the result into</p>

<p>size The size of the buffer, including the trailing null
space</p>

<p>fmt The format string to use</p>

<p>args Arguments for the format string</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This function follows C99 vsnprintf, but has
some extensions: pS output the name of a text symbol with
offset ps output the name of a text symbol without offset pF
output the name of a function pointer with its offset pf
output the name of a function pointer without its offset pR
output the address range in a struct resource n is
ignored</p>

<p>The return value is the number of characters which would
be generated for the given input, excluding the trailing
&acute; &acute;, as per ISO C99. If you want to have the
exact number of characters written into buf as return value
(not including the trailing &acute; &acute;), use
vscnprintf. If the return is greater than or equal to size,
the resulting string is truncated.</p>

<p>Call this function if you are already dealing with a
va_list. You probably want snprintf instead.</p>
