<p>NAME ppmflash - brighten a picture to approach white</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ppmflash flashfactor [ppmfile]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>ppmflash reads a PPM image as input. It changes the
color of each pixel to bring it a specified amount closer to
white. It generates a PPM image of the result.</p>

<p>flashfactor is a real number between 0 and 1, inclusive.
ppmflash increases the intensity of each RGB component by
the fraction flashfac- tor of the difference between the
current value and full intensity. So if a pixel contains 60%
full red, 10% full green, and no blue and you specify 0.5
(half), ppmflash increases the red to 80% (because it was
40% from full intensity, so it adds half of 40% to the
original 60%), the green to 55%, and the blue to 50%.</p>

<p>If flashfactor is zero, the output is identical to the
input. If flashfactor is one, the output is all white.</p>

<p>ppmbrighten does a more normal kind of brightening.
pamfunc does a very simple brightening. Both ppmbrighten and
pamfunc can reduce brightness as well.</p>

<p>pnmgamma is another way people do a similar brightening,
though it isnt really intended for that.</p>
