DEVICE</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This utility sends a SCSI SEND DIAGNOSTIC
command to the DEVICE. It can issue self-tests, find
supported diagnostic pages or send arbitrary diagnostic
pages.</p>

<p>When the --list option and a DEVICE are given then the
utility sends a SCSI RECEIVE DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS command to
fetch the response (i.e. the page numbers of supported
diagnostic pages).</p>

<p>When the --list option is given without a DEVICE then a
list of diag- nostic page names and their numbers, known by
this utility, are listed.</p>

<p>This utility supports two command line syntaxes, the
preferred one is shown first in the synopsis and explained
in this section. A later sec- tion on the old command line
syntax outlines the second group of options.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Arguments to long options are mandatory for
short options as well.</p>

<p>-d, --doff set the Device Offline (DevOffL) bit (default
is clear). Only significant when --test option is set for
the default self-test. When set other operations on any
logical units controlled by the this device server (target)
may be affected (delayed) while a default self-test is
underway.</p>

<p>-e, --extdur outputs the expected extended self-test
duration. The duration is given in seconds (and minutes in
parentheses). This figure is obtained from mode page 0xa
(i.e. the control mode page).</p>

<p>-h, --help print usage message then exit.</p>

<p>-H, --hex outputs response from RECEIVE DIAGNOSTIC
RESULTS in hex rather than decode it.</p>

<p>-l, --list when a DEVICE is also given lists the names
of all diagnostic pages supported by this device. The
request is sent via a SEND DIAGNOSTIC command (with the
&quot;pF&quot; bit set) and the response is fetched by a
RECEIVE DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS command. When used in the absence
of a --list argument then a list of diagnostic page names
and their numbers, known by this utility, are listed.</p>

<p>-O, --old switch to older style options.</p>

<p>-p, --pf set Page Format (PF) bit. By default it is
clear (i.e. 0) unless the list --list option is given in
which case the Page Format bit is set (as required by
SPC-3).</p>

<p>-r, --raw=H,H... string of comma separated hex numbers
each of which should resolve to a byte value (i.e. 0 to ff
inclusive). A (single) space separated string of hex bytes
is also allowed but the list needs to be in quotes. This
sequence forms a diagnostic page to be sent with the SCSI
SEND DIAGNOSTIC command. Mostly likely the --pf option
should also be given.</p>

<p>-r, --raw=- reads sequence of bytes from stdin. The
sequence may be comma, space, tab or linefeed (newline)
separated. If a line contains &quot;#&quot; then the
remaining characters on that line are ignored. Oth- erwise
each non separator character should resolve to a byte value
(i.e. 0 to ff inclusive). This sequence forms a diagnostic
page to be sent with the SCSI SEND DIAGNOSTIC command.
Mostly likely the --pf option should also be given.</p>

<p>-s, --selftest=ST where ST is the self-test code. The
default value is 0 which is inactive. Some other values: 1 :
background short self-test 2 : background extended self-test
4 : aborts a (background) self-test that is in progress 5 :
foreground short self-test 6 : foreground extended self-test
This option is mutually exclusive with default self-test
(i.e. cant have (ST &gt; 0) and --test).</p>

<p>-t, --test sets the _default_ Self Test (SelfTest) bit.
By default this is clear (0). The --selftest=ST option
should not be active together with this option. Both the
--doff and/or --uoff options can be used with this
option.</p>

<p>-u, --uoff set the Unit Offline (UnitOffL) bit (default
is clear). Only significant when --test option is set for
the default self-test. When set other operations on this
logical unit may be affected (delayed) while a default
self-test is underway. Some devices (e.g. Fujitsu disks) do
more tests when this bit is set.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose increase level of verbosity. Can be used
multiple times.</p>

<p>-V, --version print out version string then exit.</p>

<p>NOTES All devices should support the default self-test.
The short self-test codes should complete in 2 minutes or
less. The extended self-test codes maximum duration is
vendor specific (e.g. a little over 10 min- utes with the
authors disks). The foreground self-test codes wait until
they are completed while the background self-test codes
return immediately. The results of both foreground and
background self-test codes are placed in the self-test
results log page (see sg_logs(8)). The SCSI command timeout
for this utility is set to 60 minutes to allow for slow
foreground extended self-tests.</p>

<p>If the DEVICE is a disk then no file systems residing on
that disk should be mounted during a foreground self-test.
The reason is that other SCSI commands may become queued
behind the foreground self-test and timeout.</p>

<p>When the --raw=H,H... option is given then self-tests
should not be selected. However the --pf (i.e. &quot;page
format&quot;) option should be given. The length of the
diagnostic page to be sent is derived from the number of
bytes given to the --raw=H,H... option. The diagnostic page
code (number) should be the first byte of the sequence (i.e.
as dictated by SPC-3 diagnostic page format). The SAS 1.1
protocol specific diagnostic page could be sent with this
option, for example. The examples subdi- rectory in the
sg3_utils packages contains two example scripts that turn on
the CJTPAT (jitter pattern) on some SAS disks (one script
for each phy). One possible invocation is: sg_senddiag --pf
--raw=- /dev/sg2 &lt; .../sdiag_sas_p1_cjtpat.txt</p>

<p>Arbitrary diagnostic pages can be read (in hex) with the
sg_ses(8) utility (not only those defined in SES-2).</p>

<p>If the utility is used with no options (e.g.
&quot;sg_senddiag /dev/sg1&quot;) Then a degenerate SCSI
SEND DIAGNOSTIC command is sent with zero in all its fields
apart from the opcode. Some devices report this as an error
while others ignore it. It is not entirely clear from SPC-3
if it is invalid to send such a command.</p>

<p>In the 2.4 series of Linux kernels the DEVICE must be a
SCSI generic (sg) device. In the 2.6 series block devices
(e.g. SCSI disks and DVD drives) can also be specified. For
example sg_senddiag -t /dev/sda will work in the 2.6 series
kernels.</p>

<p>To access SCSI enclosures see the sg_ses(8) utility.
sg_ses uses the SCSI SEND DIAGNOSTIC and RECEIVE DIAGNOSTIC
RESULTS commands as out- lined in the SES-2 (draft)
standard.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The exit status of sg_senddiag is 0 when it
is successful. Otherwise see the sg3_utils(8) man page.</p>

<p>OLDER COMMAND LINE OPTIONS The options in this section
were the only ones available prior to sg3_utils version 1.23
. In sg3_utils version 1.23 and later these older options
can be selected by either setting the SG3_UTILS_OLD_OPTS
environment variable or using --old (or -O) as the first
option.</p>

<p>-doff set the Device Offline (DevOffL) bit (default is
clear). Only significant when -t option is set for the
default self-test. Equivalent to --doff in the main
description.</p>

<p>-e outputs the expected extended self-test duration.
Equivalent to --extdur in the main description.</p>

<p>-h outputs response from RECEIVE DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS in
hex rather than decode it.</p>

<p>-H outputs response from RECEIVE DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS in
hex rather than decode it.</p>

<p>-l when a DEVICE is also given lists the names of all
diagnostic pages supported by this device. The request is
sent via a SEND DIAGNOSTIC command (with the &quot;pf&quot;
bit set) and the response is fetched by a RECEIVE DIAGNOSTIC
RESULTS command. When used in the absence of a DEVICE
argument then a list of diagnostic page names and their
numbers, known by this utility, are listed.</p>

<p>-N switch to the newer style options.</p>

<p>-pf set Page Format (PF) bit. By default it is clear
(i.e. 0) unless the -l option is given in which case the
Page Format bit is set (as required by SPC-3).</p>

<p>-raw=H,H... string of comma separated hex numbers each
of which should resolve to a byte value (i.e. 0 to ff
inclusive). This sequence forms a diagnostic page to be sent
with the SCSI SEND DIAGNOSTIC command. Mostly likely the -pf
option should also be given.</p>

<p>-raw=- reads sequence of bytes from stdin. The sequence
may be comma, space, tab or linefeed (newline) separated. If
a line contains &quot;#&quot; then the remaining characters
on that line are ignored. Oth- erwise each non separator
character should resolve to a byte value (i.e. 0 to ff
inclusive). This sequence forms a diagnostic page to be sent
with the SCSI SEND DIAGNOSTIC command. Mostly likely the -pf
option should also be given.</p>

<p>-s=ST where ST is the self-test code. The default value
is 0 which is inactive. A value of 1 selects a background
short self-test; 2 selects a background extended self-test;
5 selects a foreground short self-test; 6 selects a
foreground extended test. A value of 4 will abort a
(background) self-test that is in progress. This option is
mutually exclusive with default self-test (i.e. -t).</p>

<p>-t sets the _default_ Self Test (SelfTest) bit. By
default this is clear (0). The -s=ST option should not be
active together with this option. Both the -doff and/or
-uoff options can be used with this option.</p>

<p>-uoff set the Unit Offline (UnitOffL) bit (default is
clear). Equiva- lent to --uoff in the main description.</p>

<p>-v increase level of verbosity. Can be used multiple
times.</p>

<p>-V print out version string then exit.</p>

<p>-? output usage message. Ignore all other
parameters.</p>
