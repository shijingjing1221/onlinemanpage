<p>rlm_attr_filter(5) FreeRADIUS Module
rlm_attr_filter(5)</p>

<p>NAME rlm_attr_filter - FreeRADIUS Module</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The rlm_attr_filter module exists for
filtering certain attributes and values in received ( or
transmitted ) radius packets. It gives the server a flexible
framework to filter the attributes we send to or receive
from home servers or NASes. This makes sense, for example,
in an out-sourced dialup situation to various policy
decisions, such as restricting a client to certain ranges of
Idle-Timeout or Session-Time- out.</p>

<p>Filter rules are normally defined and applied on a
per-realm basis, where the realm is anything that is defined
and matched based on the configuration of the rlm_realm
module. Filter rules can optionally be applied using another
attribute, by editing the key configuration for this
module.</p>

<p>In 2.0.1 and earlier versions, the
&quot;accounting&quot; section filtered the
Accounting-Request, even though it was documented as
filtering the response. This issue has been fixed in version
2.0.2 and later ver- sions. The &quot;preacct&quot; section
may now be used to filter Accounting- Request packets. The
&quot;accounting&quot; section now filters Accounting-
Response packets. Administrators using
&quot;attr_filter&quot; in the &quot;account- ing&quot;
section SHOULD move the reference to &quot;attr_filter&quot;
from &quot;account- ing&quot; to &quot;preacct&quot;.</p>

<p>The file that defines the attribute filtering rules
follows a similar syntax to the users file. There are a few
differences however:</p>

<p>There are no check-items allowed other than the name of
the key.</p>

<p>There can only be a single DEFAULT entry.</p>

<p>The rules for each entry are parsed to top to bottom,
and an attribute must pass *all* the rules which affect it
in order to make it past the filter. Order of the rules is
important. The operators and their purpose in defining the
rules are as follows:</p>

<p>= THIS OPERATOR IS NOT ALLOWED. If used, and warning
message is printed and it is treated as ==</p>

<p>:= Set, this attribute and value will always be placed
in the output A/V Pairs. If the attribute exists, it is
overwritten.</p>

<p>== Equal, value must match exactly.</p>

<p>=* Always Equal, allow all values for the specified
attribute.</p>

<p>!* Never Equal, disallow all values for the specified
attribute. ( This is redundant, as any A/V Pair not
explicitly permitted will be dropped ).</p>

<p>!= Not Equal, value must not match.</p>

<p>&gt;= Greater Than or Equal</p>

<p>&lt;= Less Than or Equal</p>

<p>&gt; Greater Than</p>

<p>&lt; Less Than</p>

<p>If regular expressions are enabled the following
operators are also possible. ( Regular Expressions are
included by default unless your system doesn t support them,
which should be rare ). The value field uses standard
regular expression syntax.</p>

<p>=~ Regular Expression Equal</p>

<p>!~ Regular Expression Not Equal</p>

<p>See the default /etc/raddb/attrs for working examples of
sample rule ordering and how to use the different
operators.</p>

<p>The configuration items are:</p>

<p>attrsfile This specifies the location of the file used
to load the filter rules. This file is used to filter the
accounting response, packet before it is proxied, proxy
response from the home server, or our response to the
NAS.</p>

<p>key Usually %{Realm} (the default). Can also be
%{User-Name}, or other attribute that exists in the request.
Note that the mod- ule always keys off of attributes in the
request, and NOT in any other packet.</p>

<p>SECTIONS preacct Filters Accounting-Request packets.</p>

<p>accounting Filters Accounting-Response packets.</p>

<p>pre-proxy Filters Accounting-Request or Access-Request
packets prior to proxying them.</p>

<p>post-proxy Filters Accounting-Response, Access-Accept,
Access-Reject, or Access-Challenge responses from a home
server.</p>

<p>authorize Filters Access-Request packets.</p>

<p>post-auth Filters Access-Accept or Access-Reject
packets.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/raddb/radiusd.conf /etc/raddb/attrs</p>
