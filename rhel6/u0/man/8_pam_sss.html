<p>NAME pam_sss - PAM module for SSSD</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pam_sss.so [forward_pass] [use_first_pass]
[use_authtok] [retry=N]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pam_sss.so is the PAM interface to the
System Security Services daemon (SSSD). Errors and results
are logged through syslog(3) with the LOG_AUTHPRIV
facility.</p>

<p>OPTIONS forward_pass If forward_pass is set the entered
password is put on the stack for other PAM modules to
use.</p>

<p>use_first_pass The argument use_first_pass forces the
module to use a previous stacked modules password and will
never prompt the user - if no password is available or the
password is not appropriate, the user will be denied
access.</p>

<p>use_authtok When password changing enforce the module to
set the new password to the one provided by a previously
stacked password module.</p>

<p>retry=N If specified the user is asked another N times
for a password if authentication fails. Default is 0.</p>

<p>Please note that this option might not work as expected
if the application calling PAM handles the user dialog on
its own. A typical example is sshd with
PasswordAuthentication.</p>

<p>MODULE TYPES PROVIDED All module types (account, auth,
password and session) are provided.</p>

<p>FILES If a password reset by root fails, because the
corresponding SSSD provider does not support password
resets, an individual message can be displayed. This message
can e.g. contain instructions about how to reset a
password.</p>

<p>The message is read from the file
pam_sss_pw_reset_message.LOC where LOC stands for a locale
string returned by setlocale(3). If there is no matching
file the content of pam_sss_pw_reset_message.txt is
displayed. Root must be the owner of the files and only root
may have read and write permissions while all other users
must have only read permisssions.</p>

<p>These files are searched in the directory
/etc/sssd/customize/DOMAIN_NAME/. If no matching file is
present a generic message is displayed.</p>
