<p>SENDTO(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual SENDTO(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME sendto - send a message on a socket</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;</p>

<p>ssize_t sendto(int socket, const void *message, size_t
length, int flags, const struct sockaddr *dest_addr,
socklen_t dest_len);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sendto() function shall send a message
through a connection-mode or connectionless-mode socket. If
the socket is connectionless-mode, the message shall be sent
to the address specified by dest_addr. If the socket is
connection-mode, dest_addr shall be ignored.</p>

<p>The sendto() function takes the following arguments:</p>

<p>socket Specifies the socket file descriptor.</p>

<p>message Points to a buffer containing the message to be
sent.</p>

<p>length Specifies the size of the message in bytes.</p>

<p>flags Specifies the type of message transmission. Values
of this argu- ment are formed by logically ORing zero or
more of the follow- ing flags:</p>

<p>MSG_EOR Terminates a record (if supported by the
protocol).</p>

<p>MSG_OOB Sends out-of-band data on sockets that support
out-of-band data. The significance and semantics of
out-of-band data are protocol- specific.</p>

<p>dest_addr Points to a sockaddr structure containing the
destination address. The length and format of the address
depend on the address family of the socket.</p>

<p>dest_len Specifies the length of the sockaddr structure
pointed to by the dest_addr argument.</p>

<p>If the socket protocol supports broadcast and the
specified address is a broadcast address for the socket
protocol, sendto() shall fail if the SO_BROADCAST option is
not set for the socket.</p>

<p>The dest_addr argument specifies the address of the
target. The length argument specifies the length of the
message.</p>

<p>Successful completion of a call to sendto() does not
guarantee delivery of the message. A return value of -1
indicates only locally-detected errors.</p>

<p>If space is not available at the sending socket to hold
the message to be transmitted and the socket file descriptor
does not have O_NONBLOCK set, sendto() shall block until
space is available. If space is not available at the sending
socket to hold the message to be transmitted and the socket
file descriptor does have O_NONBLOCK set, sendto() shall
fail.</p>

<p>The socket in use may require the process to have
appropriate privi- leges to use the sendto() function.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, sendto() shall
return the number of bytes sent. Otherwise, -1 shall be
returned and errno set to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The sendto() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EAFNOSUPPORT Addresses in the specified address family
cannot be used with this socket.</p>

<p>EAGAIN or EWOULDBLOCK The socket s file descriptor is
marked O_NONBLOCK and the requested operation would
block.</p>

<p>EBADF The socket argument is not a valid file
descriptor.</p>

<p>ECONNRESET A connection was forcibly closed by a
peer.</p>

<p>EINTR A signal interrupted sendto() before any data was
transmitted.</p>

<p>EMSGSIZE The message is too large to be sent all at
once, as the socket requires.</p>

<p>ENOTCONN The socket is connection-mode but is not
connected.</p>

<p>ENOTSOCK The socket argument does not refer to a
socket.</p>

<p>EOPNOTSUPP The socket argument is associated with a
socket that does not support one or more of the values set
in flags.</p>

<p>EPIPE The socket is shut down for writing, or the socket
is connec- tion-mode and is no longer connected. In the
latter case, and if the socket is of type SOCK_STREAM, the
SIGPIPE signal is gener- ated to the calling thread.</p>

<p>If the address family of the socket is AF_UNIX, then
sendto() shall fail if:</p>

<p>EIO An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing
to the file system.</p>

<p>ELOOP A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during
resolution of the pathname in the socket address.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG A component of a pathname exceeded
{NAME_MAX} characters, or an entire pathname exceeded
{PATH_MAX} characters.</p>

<p>ENOENT A component of the pathname does not name an
existing file or the pathname is an empty string.</p>

<p>ENOTDIR A component of the path prefix of the pathname
in the socket address is not a directory.</p>

<p>The sendto() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EACCES Search permission is denied for a component of
the path prefix; or write access to the named socket is
denied.</p>

<p>EDESTADDRREQ The socket is not connection-mode and does
not have its peer address set, and no destination address
was specified.</p>

<p>EHOSTUNREACH The destination host cannot be reached
(probably because the host is down or a remote router cannot
reach it).</p>

<p>EINVAL The dest_len argument is not a valid length for
the address fam- ily.</p>

<p>EIO An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing
to the file system.</p>

<p>EISCONN A destination address was specified and the
socket is already connected. This error may or may not be
returned for connection mode sockets.</p>

<p>ENETDOWN The local network interface used to reach the
destination is down.</p>

<p>ENETUNREACH No route to the network is present.</p>

<p>ENOBUFS Insufficient resources were available in the
system to perform the operation.</p>

<p>ENOMEM Insufficient memory was available to fulfill the
request.</p>

<p>If the address family of the socket is AF_UNIX, then
sendto() may fail if:</p>

<p>ELOOP More than {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic links were
encountered during resolution of the pathname in the socket
address.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG Pathname resolution of a symbolic link
produced an intermediate result whose length exceeds
{PATH_MAX}.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The select() and poll() functions can
be used to determine when it is possible to send more
data.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
