<p>PTHREAD_ONCE(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
PTHREAD_ONCE(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME pthread_once - dynamic package initialization</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;</p>

<p>int pthread_once(pthread_once_t *once_control, void
(*init_routine)(void)); pthread_once_t once_control =
PTHREAD_ONCE_INIT;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The first call to pthread_once() by any
thread in a process, with a given once_control, shall call
the init_routine with no arguments. Sub- sequent calls of
pthread_once() with the same once_control shall not call the
init_routine. On return from pthread_once(), init_routine
shall have completed. The once_control parameter shall
determine whether the associated initialization routine has
been called.</p>

<p>The pthread_once() function is not a cancellation point.
However, if init_routine is a cancellation point and is
canceled, the effect on once_control shall be as if
pthread_once() was never called.</p>

<p>The constant PTHREAD_ONCE_INIT is defined in the
&lt;pthread.h&gt; header.</p>

<p>The behavior of pthread_once() is undefined if
once_control has auto- matic storage duration or is not
initialized by PTHREAD_ONCE_INIT.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, pthread_once()
shall return zero; other- wise, an error number shall be
returned to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The pthread_once() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL If either once_control or init_routine is
invalid.</p>

<p>The pthread_once() function shall not return an error
code of [EINTR].</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE Some C libraries are designed for dynamic
initialization. That is, the global initialization for the
library is performed when the first pro- cedure in the
library is called. In a single-threaded program, this is
normally implemented using a static variable whose value is
checked on entry to a routine, as follows:</p>

<p>static int random_is_initialized = 0; extern int
initialize_random();</p>

<p>int random_function() { if (random_is_initialized == 0)
{ initialize_random(); random_is_initialized = 1; } ... /*
Operations performed after initialization. */ }</p>

<p>To keep the same structure in a multi-threaded program,
a new primitive is needed. Otherwise, library initialization
has to be accomplished by an explicit call to a
library-exported initialization function prior to any use of
the library.</p>

<p>For dynamic library initialization in a multi-threaded
process, a sim- ple initialization flag is not sufficient;
the flag needs to be pro- tected against modification by
multiple threads simultaneously calling into the library.
Protecting the flag requires the use of a mutex; how- ever,
mutexes have to be initialized before they are used.
Ensuring that the mutex is only initialized once requires a
recursive solution to this problem.</p>

<p>The use of pthread_once() not only supplies an
implementation-guaran- teed means of dynamic initialization,
it provides an aid to the reli- able construction of
multi-threaded and realtime systems. The preced- ing example
then becomes:</p>

<p>#include &lt;pthread.h&gt; static pthread_once_t
random_is_initialized = PTHREAD_ONCE_INIT; extern int
initialize_random();</p>

<p>int random_function() { (void)
pthread_once(&amp;random_is_initialized, initialize_random);
... /* Operations performed after initialization. */ }</p>

<p>Note that a pthread_once_t cannot be an array because
some compilers do not accept the construct
&amp;&lt;array_name&gt;.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
