<p>PTHREAD_ATTR_GETSTACK(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
PTHREAD_ATTR_GETSTACK(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME pthread_attr_getstack, pthread_attr_setstack - get
and set stack attributes</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;</p>

<p>int pthread_attr_getstack(const pthread_attr_t *restrict
attr, void **restrict stackaddr, size_t *restrict
stacksize); int pthread_attr_setstack(pthread_attr_t *attr,
void *stackaddr, size_t stacksize);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pthread_attr_getstack() and
pthread_attr_setstack() functions, respectively, shall get
and set the thread creation stack attributes stackaddr and
stacksize in the attr object.</p>

<p>The stack attributes specify the area of storage to be
used for the created threads stack. The base (lowest
addressable byte) of the stor- age shall be stackaddr, and
the size of the storage shall be stacksize bytes. The
stacksize shall be at least {PTHREAD_STACK_MIN}. The stack-
addr shall be aligned appropriately to be used as a stack;
for example, pthread_attr_setstack() may fail with [EINVAL]
if ( stackaddr &amp; 0x7) is not 0. All pages within the
stack described by stackaddr and stacksize shall be both
readable and writable by the thread.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, these functions
shall return a value of 0; otherwise, an error number shall
be returned to indicate the error.</p>

<p>The pthread_attr_getstack() function shall store the
stack attribute values in stackaddr and stacksize if
successful.</p>

<p>ERRORS The pthread_attr_setstack() function shall fail
if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The value of stacksize is less than
{PTHREAD_STACK_MIN} or exceeds an implementation-defined
limit.</p>

<p>The pthread_attr_setstack() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The value of stackaddr does not have proper
alignment to be used as a stack, or if ( stackaddr +
stacksize) lacks proper align- ment.</p>

<p>EACCES The stack page(s) described by stackaddr and
stacksize are not both readable and writable by the
thread.</p>

<p>These functions shall not return an error code of
[EINTR].</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE These functions are appropriate for
use by applications in an environ- ment where the stack for
a thread must be placed in some particular region of
memory.</p>

<p>While it might seem that an application could detect
stack overflow by providing a protected page outside the
specified stack region, this cannot be done portably.
Implementations are free to place the threads initial stack
pointer anywhere within the specified region to accommo-
date the machines stack pointer behavior and allocation
requirements. Furthermore, on some architectures, such as
the IA-64, &quot;overflow&quot; might mean that two separate
stack pointers allocated within the region will overlap
somewhere in the middle of the region.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
