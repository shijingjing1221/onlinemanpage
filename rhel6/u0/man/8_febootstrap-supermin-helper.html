<p>NAME febootstrap-supermin-helper - Reconstruct initramfs
from supermin appliance.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS febootstrap-supermin-helper supermin.img
hostfiles.txt host_cpu kernel initrd
febootstrap-supermin-helper input [...] host_cpu kernel
initrd</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION febootstrap-supermin-helper reconstructs a
bootable kernel and initramfs from a supermin appliance.
First you should be familiar with febootstrap(8),
febootstrap-to-initramfs(8) and
febootstrap-to-supermin(8).</p>

<p>PARAMETERS Of the four or five required parameters, the
first few are input files, and the last two are output
files.</p>

<p>&quot;supermin.img&quot; and &quot;hostfiles.txt&quot;
are the input files which describe the supermin appliance.
(You can also use a directory name here which is searched
for files).</p>

<p>&quot;host_cpu&quot; should be the host CPU, eg.
&quot;x86_64&quot; or &quot;i686&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;kernel&quot; and &quot;initrd&quot; are the
temporary output files that this script produces. These
output files are meant to be used just for booting the
appliance, and should be deleted straight afterwards.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -k file | --kmods file If this option is
specified, then &quot;file&quot; should be a list of
wildcards matching kernel module names, eg:</p>

<p>virtio*.ko scsi*.ko piix.ko</p>

<p>In this case, only kernel modules matching those
wildcards will be included in the output appliance. Note:
You must resolve any dependencies yourself as this does not
pull in dependent modules automatically.</p>

<p>If this option is not specified, then every kernel
module from the host will be included. This is safer, but
can produce rather large appliances which need a lot more
memory to boot.</p>

<p>SPEED In libguestfs, on a mid-range Intel-based PC, we
reconstruct the initramfs using this script in around 1/5th
of a second (assuming a &quot;hot cache&quot; - its rather
slower when run the first time on a cold cache).</p>

<p>Some tips to improve performance:</p>

<p>&middot; Use a kernel module whitelist (the
&quot;--kmods&quot; option), and only list the kernel
modules you really need.</p>

<p>&middot; Minimize the appliance, removing as much
extraneous junk as possible.</p>

<p>As well as using febootstrap-minimize(8) it is worth
checking for anything that is not necessary for your
particular application and removing it by hand.</p>
