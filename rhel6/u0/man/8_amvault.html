<p>NAME amvault - Copy Amanda dumps from one volume to
another</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS amvault [-o configoption]... config
src-run-timestamp dst-changer label-template</p>

<p>WARNING This application is not yet in its final form,
and is subject to major revision in subsequent versions of
Amanda. Backward compatibility is not guaranteed.</p>

<p>The significant limitations of this version of amvault
are: tapetypes for secondary and tertiary volumes much match
(including length and device_properties); tertiary volumes
must be blank (manual erasure is required to re-use tertiary
media; restore/recover operations will request tertiary
media by label when dumpfiles are not found on secondary
media, but there is no provision to automatically fetch such
media from a different changer; and all dumpfiles on a
secondary volume are moved to tertiary media - there is no
provision to filter dumps.</p>

<p>Feedback on and patches to this application are invited
and encouraged!</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Amvault Copies data from the run with
timestamp src-run-timestamp onto volumes using the changer
dst-changer, labeling new volumes with label-template. If
src-run-timestamp is &quot;latest&quot;, then the most
recent amdump or amflush run will be used.</p>

<p>In a vaulting operation, the source media is referred to
as &quot;secondary media&quot;, while the destination is
referred to as &quot;tertiary media&quot;.</p>

<p>Each source volume will be copied to a new destination
volume; no re-assembly or splitting will be performed.
Destination volumes must be at least as large as the source
volumes.</p>

<p>The changer parameter should specify the name of a
changer defined in amanda.conf(5). For example:</p>

<p>define changer vaulting_tape { tapedev
&quot;/dev/rmt/1n&quot; tpchanger &quot;chg-zd-mtx&quot;
changerdev &quot;/dev/sg0&quot; changerfile
&quot;vaulting-changer.conf&quot; }</p>

<p>The label template functions identically to the
label-new-tapes parameter in amanda.conf(5).</p>
