<p>raise(n) Tk Built-In Commands raise(n)</p>


<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME raise - Change a windows position in the stacking
order</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS raise window ?aboveThis?
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION If the aboveThis argument is omitted then
the command raises window so that it is above all of its
siblings in the stacking order (it will not be obscured by
any siblings and will obscure any siblings that overlap it).
If aboveThis is specified then it must be the path name of a
win- dow that is either a sibling of window or the
descendant of a sibling of window. In this case the raise
command will insert window into the stacking order just
above aboveThis (or the ancestor of aboveThis that is a
sibling of window); this could end up either raising or
lowering window.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE Make a button appear to be in a sibling frame
that was created after it. This is is often necessary when
building GUIs in the style where you create your activity
widgets first before laying them out on the display: button
.b -text &quot;Hi there!&quot; pack [frame .f -background
blue] pack [label .f.l1 -text &quot;This is above&quot;]
pack .b -in .f pack [label .f.l2 -text &quot;This is
below&quot;] raise .b</p>
