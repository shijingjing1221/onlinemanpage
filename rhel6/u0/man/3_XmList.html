<p>NAME XmList The List widget class</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;Xm/List.h&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION List allows a user to select one or more
items from a group of choices. Items are selected from the
list in a variety of ways, using both the pointer and the
keyboard. List operates on an array of compound strings that
are defined by the application. Each compound string becomes
an item in the List, with the first compound string becoming
the item in position 1, the second becoming the item in
position 2, and so on.</p>

<p>Specifying the number of items that are visible sets the
size of the List. If the number of visible items is not
specified, the height of the list controls the number of
visible items. Each item assumes the height of the tallest
element in the list. To create a list that allows the user
to scroll easily through a large number of items, use the
XmCreateScrolledList convenience function.</p>

<p>To select items, move the pointer or cursor to the
desired item and press the &lt;Btn1&gt; mouse button or the
key defined as &lt;osfSelect&gt;. There are several styles
of selection behavior, and they all highlight the selected
item or items by displaying them in inverse colors. An
appro- priate callback is invoked to notify the application
of the users choice. The application then takes whatever
action is required for the specified selection. When a List
is insensitive, all of the list items are displayed in a
stippled fill pattern.</p>

<p>List uses the XmQTspecifyRenderTable, XmQTscrollFrame,
and XmQTnaviga- tor traits, and holds the XmQTtransfer
trait.</p>

<p>Selection Each list has one of four selection
models:</p>

<p>&middot; Single Select</p>

<p>&middot; Browse Select</p>

<p>&middot; Multiple Select</p>

<p>&middot; Extended Select</p>

<p>In Single Select and Browse Select, at most one item is
selected at a time. In Single Select, pressing &lt;Btn1&gt;
on an item toggles its selec- tion state and deselects any
other selected item. In Browse Select, pressing &lt;Btn1&gt;
on an item selects it and deselects any other selected item;
dragging &lt;Btn1&gt; moves the selection as the pointer is
moved. Releasing &lt;Btn1&gt; on an item moves the location
cursor to that item.</p>

<p>In Multiple Select, any number of items can be selected
at a time. Pressing &lt;Btn1&gt; on an item toggles its
selection state but does not deselect any other selected
items.</p>

<p>In Extended Select, any number of items can be selected
at a time, and the user can easily select ranges of items.
Pressing &lt;Btn1&gt; on an item selects it and deselects
any other selected item. Dragging &lt;Btn1&gt; or pressing
or dragging &lt;Shift&gt;&lt;Btn1&gt; following a
&lt;Btn1&gt; action selects all items between the item under
the pointer and the item on which &lt;Btn1&gt; was pressed.
This action also deselects any other selected items outside
that range.</p>

<p>Extended Select also allows the user to select and
deselect discontigu- ous ranges of items. Pressing
&lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;Btn1&gt; on an item toggles its selection
state but does not deselect any other selected items. Drag-
ging &lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;Btn1&gt; or pressing or dragging
&lt;Shift&gt;&lt;Btn1&gt; following a
&lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;Btn1&gt; action sets the selection state of
all items between the item under the pointer and the item on
which &lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;Btn1&gt; was pressed to the state of
the item on which &lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;Btn1&gt; was pressed. This
action does not deselect any other selected items outside
that range.</p>

<p>All selection operations available from the mouse are
also available from the keyboard. List has two keyboard
selection modes, Normal Mode and Add Mode. In Normal Mode,
navigation operations and &lt;osfSelect&gt; select the item
at the location cursor and deselect any other selected
items. In Add Mode, navigation operations have no effect on
selection, and &lt;osfSelect&gt; toggles the selection state
of the item at the location cursor without deselecting any
other selected items, except in Single Select.</p>

<p>Single and Multiple Select use Add Mode, and Browse
Select uses Normal Mode.</p>

<p>Extended Select can use either mode; the user changes
modes by pressing &lt;osfAddMode&gt;. In Extended Select
Normal Mode, pressing &lt;osfSelect&gt; has the same effect
as pressing &lt;Btn1&gt;; &lt;osfExtend&gt; and shifted
navigation have the same effect as pressing
&lt;Shift&gt;&lt;Btn1&gt; following a &lt;Btn1&gt; action.
In Extended Select Add Mode, pressing &lt;osfSelect&gt; has
the same effect as pressing &lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;Btn1&gt;;
&lt;osfExtend&gt; and shifted navigation have the same
effect as pressing &lt;Shift&gt;&lt;Btn1&gt; following a
&lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;Btn1&gt; action.</p>

<p>Normal Mode is indicated by a solid location cursor, and
Add Mode is indicated by a dashed location cursor.</p>

<p>Data Transfer Behavior List supports dragging of items
from the List and transfer of items to the clipboard. When
the user presses BTransfer on a selected item, the widget
transfers all selected items. When the user presses
BTransfer on an unselected item, the widget transfers only
that item. Depending on the value of XmNprimaryOwnership,
List can also support primary selection.</p>

<p>When the XmNconvertCallback procedures are called, the
location_data member of the XmConvertCallbackStruct member
is NULL if the selected items are being transferred. If the
selected items are not being transferred, this member has
the following value: If a single item is being transferred,
the value is an integer representing the position of the
item in the List. A value of 1 transfers the first item in
the List; a value of 2 transfers the second item; and so on.
If the entire contents of the List are being transferred,
the value is -1.</p>

<p>As a source of data, List supports the following targets
and associated conversions of data to these targets:</p>

<p>locale If the locale target matches the widgets locale,
the widget transfers the selected list items in the encoding
of the locale. Each item transferred except the last
includes a trailing separator.</p>

<p>COMPOUND_TEXT The widget transfers the selected list
items as type COM- POUND_TEXT. Each item transferred except
the last includes a trailing separator.</p>

<p>UTF8_STRING The widget transfers the selected list items
as type UTF8_STRING. Each item transferred except the last
includes a trailing separator.</p>

<p>STRING The widget transfers the selected list items as
type STRING. Each item transferred except the last includes
a trailing separator.</p>

<p>TEXT If the selected list items are fully convertible to
the encoding of the locale, the widget transfers the
selected list items in the encoding of the locale.
Otherwise, the widget transfers the selected list items as
type COM- POUND_TEXT. Each item transferred except the last
includes a trailing separator.</p>

<p>_MOTIF_CLIPBOARD_TARGETS The widget transfers, as type
ATOM, a list of the targets it supports for immediate
transfer for the CLIPBOARD selection. These include
_MOTIF_COMPOUND_STRING. If the selected list items are fully
convertible to STRING, these also include STRING; otherwise,
they also include COMPOUND_TEXT and UTF8_STRING.</p>

<p>_MOTIF_COMPOUND_STRING The widget transfers the selected
list items as a compound string in Byte Stream format. Each
item transferred except the last includes a trailing
separator.</p>

<p>_MOTIF_DEFERRED_CLIPBOARD_TARGETS The widget transfers,
as type ATOM, a list of the targets it supports for delayed
transfer for the CLIPBOARD selection. This widget currently
supplies no targets for
_MOTIF_DEFERRED_CLIPBOARD_TARGETS.</p>

<p>_MOTIF_EXPORT_TARGETS The widget transfers, as type
ATOM, a list of the targets to be used as the value of the
DragContext s XmNexportTargets in a drag-and-drop transfer.
These include _MOTIF_COM- POUND_STRING, COMPOUND_TEXT,
UTF8_STRING, the encoding of the locale, STRING, TEXT,
BACKGROUND, and FOREGROUND.</p>

<p>_MOTIF_LOSE_SELECTION When the widget loses the
selection, it deselects all list items.</p>

<p>As a source of data, List also supports the following
standard Motif targets:</p>

<p>BACKGROUND The widget transfers XmNbackground as type
PIXEL.</p>

<p>CLASS The widget finds the first shell in the widget
hierarchy that has a WM_CLASS property and transfers the
contents as text in the current locale.</p>

<p>CLIENT_WINDOW The widget finds the first shell in the
widget hierarchy and transfers its window as type
WINDOW.</p>

<p>COLORMAP The widget transfers XmNcolormap as type
COLORMAP.</p>

<p>FOREGROUND The widget transfers XmNforeground as type
PIXEL.</p>

<p>NAME The widget finds the first shell in the widget
hierarchy that has a WM_NAME property and transfers the
contents as text in the current locale.</p>

<p>TARGETS The widget transfers, as type ATOM, a list of
the targets it supports. These include the standard targets
in this list. These also include _MOTIF_COMPOUND_STRING,
COMPOUND_TEXT, UTF8_STRING the encoding of the locale,
STRING, and TEXT.</p>

<p>TIMESTAMP The widget transfers the timestamp used to
acquire the selec- tion as type INTEGER.</p>

<p>_MOTIF_RENDER_TABLE The widget transfers XmNrenderTable
if it exists, or else the default text render table, as type
STRING.</p>

<p>_MOTIF_ENCODING_REGISTRY The widget transfers its
encoding registry as type STRING. The value is a list of
NULL separated items in the form of tag encoding pairs. This
target symbolizes the transfer tar- get for the Motif
Segment Encoding Registry. Widgets and applications can use
this Registry to register text encoding formats for
specified render table tags. Applications access this
Registry by calling XmRegisterSegmentEncoding and
XmMapSegmentEncoding.</p>

<p>List has no widget class destination procedure.
Subclasses and the XmNdestinationCallback procedures are
responsible for any data trans- fers to the widget.</p>

<p>Classes List inherits behavior, resources, and traits
from Core and XmPrimi- tive.</p>

<p>The class pointer is xmListWidgetClass.</p>

<p>The class name is XmList.</p>

<p>New Resources The following table defines a set of
widget resources used by the pro- grammer to specify data.
The programmer can also set the resource val- ues for the
inherited classes to set attributes for this widget. To
reference a resource by name or by class in a .Xdefaults
file, remove the XmN or XmC prefix and use the remaining
letters. To specify one of the defined values for a resource
in a .Xdefaults file, remove the Xm prefix and use the
remaining letters (in either lowercase or uppercase, but
include any underscores between words). The codes in the
access column indicate if the given resource can be set at
creation time (C), set by using XtSetValues (S), retrieved
by using XtGetValues (G), or is not applicable (N/A).</p>

XmNautomaticSelection Invokes either
XmNbrowseSelectionCallback or XmNextendedSe- lectionCallback
when &lt;Btn1&gt; is pressed and the items that are shown as
selected change if the value is True (or XmAUTO) and the
selection mode is either XmBROWSE_SELECT or XmEX-
TENDED_SELECT respectively. If False (XmNO_AUTO_SELECT), no
selection callbacks are invoked until the user releases the
mouse button. See Behavior for further details on the inter-
action of this resource with the selection modes.</p>

<p>XmNbrowseSelectionCallback Specifies a list of callbacks
that is called when an item is selected in the browse
selection mode. The reason is XmCR_BROWSE_SELECT.</p>

<p>XmNdefaultActionCallback Specifies a list of callbacks
that is called when an item is double clicked or
&lt;osfActivate&gt; is pressed. The reason is
XmCR_DEFAULT_ACTION.</p>

<p>XmNdestinationCallback Specifies a list of callbacks
called when the List is the destination of a transfer
operation. The type of the struc- ture whose address is
passed to these callbacks is XmDestina- tionCallbackStruct.
The reason is XmCR_OK.</p>

<p>XmNdoubleClickInterval If a button click is followed by
another button click within the time span specified by this
resource (in milliseconds), the button clicks are considered
a double-click action, rather than two single-click actions.
The value must not be negative. The default value is the
display s multiclick time.</p>

<p>XmNextendedSelectionCallback Specifies a list of
callbacks that is called when items are selected using the
extended selection mode. The reason is
XmCR_EXTENDED_SELECT.</p>

<p>XmNfontList Specifies the font list associated with the
list items. XmN- fontList is obsolete and exists only for
compatibility with previous releases. You should now use
XmNrenderTable instead of XmNfontList. If both are
specified, the render table will take precedence. The font
list is used in conjunction with the XmNvisibleItemCount
resource to determine the height of the List widget. If this
value is NULL at initialization, the parent hierarchy of the
widget is searched for a widget that holds the
XmQTspecifyRenderTable trait. If such an ancestor is found,
the font list is initialized to the XmTEXT_RENDER_TABLE
value of the ancestor widget. If no such widget is found,
the default is implementation dependent. Refer to
XmFontList(3) for more information on a font list
structure.</p>

<p>XmNitemCount Specifies the total number of items. The
value must be the number of items in XmNitems and must not
be negative. It is automatically updated by the list
whenever an item is added to or deleted from the list.</p>

<p>XmNitems Points to an array of compound strings that are
to be dis- played as the list items. Refer to XmString(3)
for more information on the creation and structure of
compound strings. XtGetValues for this resource returns the
list items themselves, not a copy of the list items. The
applica- tion must not free the returned items.</p>

<p>XmNlistMarginHeight Specifies the height of the margin
between the list border and the items.</p>

<p>XmNlistMarginWidth Specifies the width of the margin
between the list border and the items.</p>

<p>XmNlistSizePolicy Controls the reaction of the List when
an item grows horizon- tally beyond the current size of the
list work area. If the value is XmCONSTANT, the list viewing
area does not grow, and a horizontal ScrollBar is added for
a List whose parent is a ScrolledWindow. If this resource is
set to XmVARIABLE, the List grows to match the size of the
longest item, and no hor- izontal ScrollBar appears.</p>

<p>When the value of this resource is XmRESIZE_IF_POSSIBLE,
the List attempts to grow or shrink to match the width of
the widest item. If it cannot grow to match the widest size,
a horizontal ScrollBar is added for a List whose parent is a
ScrolledWindow if the longest item is wider than the list
viewing area.</p>

<p>The size policy must be set at the time the List widget
is created. It cannot be changed at a later time through
XtSet- Values.</p>

<p>XmNlistSpacing Specifies the spacing between list items.
This spacing increases by the value of the
XmNhighlightThickness resource in Primitive.</p>

<p>XmNmatchBehavior Specifies the matching behavior
followed by XmList. The cur- rent values are XmNONE and
XmQUICK_NAVIGATE, as follows:</p>

<p>XmNONE Specifies that the typed in characters are
ignored.</p>

<p>XmQUICK_NAVIGATE Specifies that 1-character navigation
shall be sup- ported when List has focus. If the typed
character is the initial character of some set of items in
List, the first of those items following the cur- rent item
will be navigated to (become the current item). If all such
items precede the current item, the first such item becomes
the current item. Subsequently, typing the same character
will cycli- cally navigate among the items with the same
first character.</p>

<p>XmNmultipleSelectionCallback Specifies a list of
callbacks that is called when an item is selected in
multiple selection mode. The reason is XmCR_MUL-
TIPLE_SELECT.</p>

<p>XmNprimaryOwnership Specifies whether XmContainer takes
ownership of the Primary selection when a selection is made
inside it. This resource can take the following values:</p>

<p>XmOWN_NEVER Never takes ownership.</p>

<p>XmOWN_ALWAYS Always takes ownership.</p>

<p>XmOWN_MULTIPLE Only takes ownership is more than one
element has been selected.</p>

<p>XmOWN_POSSIBLE_MULTIPLE Only takes ownership if more
than one element can be selected at a time.</p>

<p>XmNrenderTable Specifies the render table associated
with the list items. The render table is used in conjunction
with the XmNvisi- bleItemCount resource to determine the
height of the List widget. If this value is NULL at
initialization, List searches its parent hierarchy for a
widget that holds the XmQTspecifyRenderTable trait. If such
an ancestor is found, the render table is initialized to the
XmTEXT_RENDER_TABLE value of the ancestor widget. If no such
widget is found, the default is implementation dependent. If
a font list and a render table are both specified, the
render table will take precedence. Refer to XmRenderTable(3)
for more information on the creation and structure of a
render table.</p>

<p>XmNscrollBarDisplayPolicy Controls the display of
vertical ScrollBars in a List whose parent is a
ScrolledWindow. When the value of this resource is
XmAS_NEEDED, a vertical ScrollBar is displayed only when the
number of items in the List exceeds the number of visible
items. When the value is XmSTATIC, a vertical ScrollBar is
always displayed.</p>

<p>XmNselectColor Allows the application to specify the
color of the background rectangle that indicates selected
text. It takes two values:</p>

<p>XmDEFAULT_SELECT_COLOR Causes the select color to be set
to a color between the background and the bottom shadow
color.</p>

<p>XmREVERSED_GROUND_COLORS Forces the select color to the
foreground color and the color of any text rendered over the
select color to be in the background color.</p>

<p>HIGHLIGHT_COLOR Forces the fill color to use the
highlight color.</p>

<p>XmNselectedItemCount Specifies the number of strings in
the selected items list. The value must be the number of
items in XmNselectedItems and must not be negative.</p>

<p>XmNselectedItems Points to an array of compound strings
that represents the list items that are currently selected,
either by the user or by the application. XtGetValues for
this resource returns the list items themselves, not a copy
of the list items. The application must not free the
returned items or the array.</p>

<p>Setting XmNselectedItems selects those list items that
exactly match items in the given XmNselectedItems list.
There may be additional items in XmNselectedItems that do
not match items in the list. These items remain until
XmNselectedItems is updated. If XmNitems is changed such
that the list now contains items matching previously
unmatched items in XmNse- lectedItems, those new items will
also appear selected.</p>

<p>Any user interaction with the list that causes at least
one item to be selected or deselected and any call to
XmList- DeleteAllItems, XmListDeleteItem, XmListDeleteItems,
XmList- DeleteItemsPos, XmListDeletePos,
XmListDeletePositions, XmListDeselectAllItems,
XmListDeselectItem, XmListDeselect- Pos, XmListSelectItem,
XmListSelectPos, or XmListUpdateSe- lectedList cause
XmNselectedItems to be updated immediately to exactly
reflect the visual state of the list. Calls to any other
XmList functions do not affect XmNselectedItems.</p>

<p>XmNselectedPositionCount Specifies the number of
positions in the selected positions list. The value must be
the number of items in XmNselected- Positions</p>

<p>XmNselectedPositions Points to an array of the positions
of the selected items in the List. XtGetValues for this
resource returns the list items themselves, not a copy of
the list items. The applica- tion must not free the returned
items or the array.</p>

<p>XmNselectionMode Defines what effect keyboard
navigations have on selection. The valid modes are:</p>

<p>XmADD_MODE Allows no navigation operations to have
effect on selection, and &lt;osfSelect&gt; toggles the
selection state of the item at the location cursor without
deselecting any other selected items, except in Single
Select. However, the widget cannot be put into add mode if
the XmNselectionPolicy resource is an incompatible mode
(XmNselectionPolicy cannot be XmBROWSE_SELECT).</p>

<p>XmNORMAL_MODE Allows navigation operations and
&lt;osfSelect&gt; to select the item at the location cursor
and deselect any other selected items. However, the widget
can- not be put into normal mode if the XmNselectionPol- icy
resource is an incompatible mode (XmNselection- Policy
cannot be XmSINGLE_SELECT or XmMULTI- PLE_SELECT).</p>

<p>XmNselectionPolicy Defines the interpretation of the
selection action. This can be one of the following:</p>

<p>XmSINGLE_SELECT Allows only single selections</p>

<p>XmMULTIPLE_SELECT Allows multiple selections</p>

<p>XmEXTENDED_SELECT Allows extended selections</p>

<p>XmBROWSE_SELECT Allows drag-and-browse functionality</p>

<p>XmNsingleSelectionCallback Specifies a list of callbacks
that is called when an item is selected in single selection
mode. The reason is XmCR_SIN- GLE_SELECT.</p>

<p>XmNstringDirection Is a synthetic resource for setting
XmNlayoutDirection. The values for this resource are
XmSTRING_DIRECTION_L_TO_R and XmSTRING_DIRECTION_R_TO_L.
Refer to the XmNlayoutDirection resource description. The
XmNstringDirection resource is obsoleted by
XmNlayoutDirection, but is kept here for back- ward
compatibility.</p>

<p>XmNtopItemPosition Specifies the position of the item
that is the first visible item in the list. Setting this
resource is equivalent to calling the XmListSetPos function.
The position of the first item in the list is 1; the
position of the second item is 2; and so on. A position of 0
(zero) specifies the last item in the list. The value must
not be negative.</p>

<p>XmNvisibleItemCount Specifies the number of items that
can fit in the visible space of the list work area. The List
uses this value to determine its height. The value must be
greater than 0 (zero).</p>

<p>Inherited Resources List inherits behavior and resources
from the superclasses described in the following tables. For
a complete description of each resource, refer to the
reference page for that superclass.</p>

Callback Information List defines a new callback structure.
The application must first look at the reason field and use
only the structure members that are valid for that
particular reason, because not all fields are relevant for
every possible reason. The callback structure is defined as
follows:</p>

<p>typedef struct { int reason; XEvent *event; XmString
item; int item_length; int item_position; XmString
*selected_items; int selected_item_count; int
*selected_item_positions; char selection_type; unsigned char
auto_selection_type; } XmListCallbackStruct;</p>

<p>reason Indicates why the callback was invoked.</p>

<p>event Points to the XEvent that triggered the callback.
It can be NULL.</p>

<p>item The last item selected at the time of the event
that caused the callback. item points to a temporary storage
space that is reused after the callback is finished.
Therefore, if an application needs to save the item, it
should copy the item into its own data space.</p>

<p>item_length The length in bytes of item. This member is
obsolete and exists for compatibility with earlier
releases.</p>

<p>item_position The position (plus one) of item in the
Lists XmNitems array. An item_position value of one
symbolizes the first element in the list.</p>

<p>selected_items A list of items selected at the time of
the event that caused the callback. selected_items points to
a temporary storage space that is reused after the callback
is finished. There- fore, if an application needs to save
the selected list, it should copy the list into its own data
space.</p>

<p>selected_item_count The number of items in the
selected_items list. This number must be non-negative.</p>

<p>selected_item_positions An array of integers, one for
each selected item, represent- ing the position of each
selected item in the Lists XmNitems array.
selected_item_positions points to a temporary storage space
that is reused after the callback is finished. There- fore,
if an application needs to save this array, it should copy
the array into its own data space.</p>

<p>selection_type Indicates that the most recent extended
selection was the initial selection (XmINITIAL), a
modification of an existing selection (XmMODIFICATION), or
an additional noncontiguous selection (XmADDITION).</p>

<p>auto_selection_type Indicates the type of automatic
selection callback. The types of callbacks include the
following:</p>

<p>XmAUTO_BEGIN Indicates the beginning of automatic
selection.</p>

<p>XmAUTO_MOTION Indicates that there is a button drag
selection.</p>

<p>XmAUTO_CANCEL Indicates that the new selection is
cancelled.</p>

<p>XmAUTO_NO_CHANGE Indicates that the currently selected
item matches the initial item.</p>

<p>XmAUTO_CHANGE Indicates that the currently selected item
does not match the initial item.</p>

<p>The following table describes the reasons for which the
individual callback structure fields are valid.</p>

<p>+---------------------+----------------------------+
|Reason | Valid Fields |
+---------------------+----------------------------+
|XmCR_SINGLE_SELECT | reason, event, item, | | |
item_length, item_position |
+---------------------+----------------------------+
|XmCR_DEFAULT_ACTION | reason, event, item, | | |
item_length, item_posi- | | | tion, selected_items, | | |
selected_item_count, | | | selected_item_positions |
+---------------------+----------------------------+
|XmCR_BROWSE_SELECT | reason, event, item, | | |
item_length, item_position |
+---------------------+----------------------------+
|XmCR_MULTIPLE_SELECT | reason, event, item, | | |
item_length, item_posi- | | | tion, selected_items, | | |
selected_item_count, | | | selected_item_positions |
+---------------------+----------------------------+
|XmCR_EXTENDED_SELECT | reason, event, item, | | |

+---------------------+----------------------------+
+---------------------+----------------------------+ A
pointer to the following callback structure is passed to the
XmNdes- tinationCallback procedures:</p>

<p>typedef struct { int reason; XEvent *event; Atom
selection; XtEnum operation; int flags; XtPointer
transfer_id; XtPointer destination_data; XtPointer
location_data; Time time; } XmDestinationCallbackStruct;</p>

<p>reason Indicates why the callback was invoked.</p>

<p>event Points to the XEvent that triggered the callback.
It can be NULL.</p>

<p>selection Indicates the selection for which data
transfer is being requested. Possible values are CLIPBOARD,
PRIMARY, SEC- ONDARY, and _MOTIF_DROP.</p>

<p>operation Indicates the type of transfer operation
requested.</p>

<p>&middot; When the selection is PRIMARY, possible values
are XmMOVE, XmCOPY, and XmLINK.</p>

<p>&middot; When the selection is SECONDARY or CLIPBOARD,
possible values are XmCOPY and XmLINK.</p>

<p>&middot; When the selection is _MOTIF_DROP, possible
values are XmMOVE, XmCOPY, XmLINK, and XmOTHER. A value of
XmOTHER means that the callback procedure must get fur- ther
information from the XmDropProcCallbackStruct in the
destination_data member.</p>

<p>flags Indicates whether or not the destination widget is
also the source of the data to be transferred. Following are
the pos- sible values:</p>

<p>XmCONVERTING_NONE The destination widget is not the
source of the data to be transferred.</p>

<p>XmCONVERTING_SAME The destination widget is the source
of the data to be transferred.</p>

<p>transfer_id Serves as a unique ID to identify the
transfer transaction.</p>

<p>destination_data Contains information about the
destination. When the selec- tion is _MOTIF_DROP, the
callback procedures are called by the drop site s
XmNdropProc, and destination_data is a pointer to the
XmDropProcCallbackStruct passed to the XmN- dropProc
procedure. When the selection is SECONDARY, desti-
nation_data is an Atom representing a target recommmended by
the selection owner for use in converting the selection.
Otherwise, destination_data is NULL.</p>

<p>location_data Contains information about the location
where data is to be transferred. The value is always NULL
when the selection is SECONDARY or CLIPBOARD. If the value
is NULL, the data is to be inserted at the widget s cursor
position. Otherwise, the value is an integer representing
the position in the List where the items are to be
transferred. A value of 1 makes the first new item the first
item in the list; a value of 2 makes it the second item; and
so on. Once XmTransferDone procedures start to be called,
location_data will no longer be stable.</p>

<p>time Indicates the time when the transfer operation
began.</p>

<p>Translations XmList includes translations from
Primitive. The XmList translations are described in the
following list.</p>

<p>The following key names are listed in the X standard key
event transla- tion table syntax. This format is the one
used by Motif to specify the widget actions corresponding to
a given key. A brief overview of the format is provided
under VirtualBindings(3). For a complete descrip- tion of
the format, please refer to the X Toolkit Instrinsics
Documen- tation.</p>

<p>The List button event translations are modified when
Displays XmNen- ableBtn1Transfer resource does not have a
value of XmOFF (in other words, it is either
XmBUTTON2_TRANSFER or XmBUTTON2_ADJUST). This option allows
the actions for selection and transfer to be integrated on
&lt;Btn1&gt;, and the actions for extending the selection
can be bound to &lt;Btn2&gt;. The actions for &lt;Btn1&gt;
that are defined above still apply when the &lt;Btn1&gt;
event occurs over text that is not selected. The following
actions apply when the &lt;Btn1&gt; event occurs over text
that is selected:</p>

<p>&lt;Btn1Motion&gt;:
ListProcessBtn1(ListButtonMotion)</p>

<p>sma &lt;Btn1Down&gt;
ListProcessBtn1(ListBeginExtend)</p>

<p>sma &lt;Btn1Up&gt; ListProcessBtn1(ListEndExtend)</p>

<p>csma &lt;Btn1Down&gt;
ListProcessBtn1(ListBeginToggle)</p>

<p>csma &lt;Btn1Up&gt; ListProcessBtn1(ListEndToggle)</p>

<p>scma &lt;Btn1Down&gt;
ListProcessBtn1(ListBeginSelect)</p>

<p>scma &lt;Btn1Up&gt; ListProcessBtn1(ListEndSelect)</p>

<p>When Displays XmNenableBtn1Transfer resource has a value
of XmBUT- TON2_ADJUST, the following actions apply:</p>

<p>&lt;Btn2Down&gt;: ListProcessBtn2(ListBeginExtend)</p>

<p>&lt;Btn2Motion&gt;:
ListProcessBtn2(ListButtonMotion)</p>

<p>&lt;Btn2Up&gt;: ListProcessBtn2(ListEndExtend)</p>

<p>Action Routines The XmList action routines are described
in the following list. The current selection is always shown
with inverted colors.</p>

<p>ListAddMode(): Toggles the state of Add Mode for
keyboard selection.</p>

<p>ListBeginData(): Moves the location cursor to the first
item in the list. In Normal Mode, this also deselects any
current selection, selects the first item in the list, and
calls the appropriate selection callbacks
(XmNbrowseSelectionCallback when XmNse- lectionPolicy is set
to XmBROWSE_SELECT, XmNextendedSelec- tionCallback when
XmNselectionPolicy is set to XmEX- TENDED_SELECT).</p>

<p>ListBeginDataExtend(): If XmNselectionPolicy is set to
XmMULTIPLE_SELECT or XmEX- TENDED_SELECT, this action moves
the location cursor to the first item in the list.</p>

<p>If XmNselectionPolicy is set to XmEXTENDED_SELECT, this
action does the following: If an extended selection has been
made from the current anchor point, restores the selection
state of the items in that range to their state before the
extended selection was done; changes the selection state of
the first item and all items between it and the current
anchor point to the state of the item at the current anchor
point; calls the XmNextendedSelectionCallback callbacks.</p>

<p>ListBeginExtend(): If XmNselectionPolicy is set to
XmEXTENDED_SELECT, this action does the following: If an
extended selection has been made from the current anchor
point, restores the selection state of the items in that
range to their state before the extended selection was done,
and changes the selection state of the item under the
pointer and all items between it and the current anchor
point to the state of the item at the cur- rent anchor
point. If XmNautomaticSelection is set to True, this action
calls the XmNextendedSelectionCallback callbacks. The
auto_selection_type component of the callback structure will
be set to XmAUTO_BEGIN.</p>

<p>ListBeginLine(): Moves the horizontal scroll region to
the beginning of the line.</p>

<p>ListBeginSelect(): If XmNselectionPolicy is set to
XmSINGLE_SELECT, deselects any current selection and toggles
the selection state of the item under the pointer.</p>

<p>If XmNselectionPolicy is set to XmBROWSE_SELECT,
deselects any current selection and selects the item under
the pointer. If XmNautomaticSelection is set to True, calls
the XmNbrows- eSelectionCallback callbacks. The
auto_selection_type compo- nent of the callback structure
will be set to XmAUTO_BEGIN.</p>

<p>If XmNselectionPolicy is set to XmMULTIPLE_SELECT,
toggles the selection state of the item under the pointer.
Any pre- vious selections remain.</p>

<p>If XmNselectionPolicy is set to XmEXTENDED_SELECT, this
action deselects any current selection, selects the item
under the pointer, and sets the current anchor at that item.
If XmNautomaticSelection is set to True, this action calls
the XmNextendedSelectionCallback callbacks. The auto_selec-
tion_type component of the callback structure will be set to
XmAUTO_BEGIN.</p>

<p>ListBeginToggle(): If XmNselectionPolicy is set to
XmEXTENDED_SELECT, this action moves the current anchor to
the item under the pointer without changing the current
selection. If the item is unse- lected, this action selects
it; if the item is selected, this action unselects it. If
XmNautomaticSelection is set to True, this action calls the
XmNextendedSelectionCallback callbacks.</p>

<p>Otherwise, the list takes keyboard focus. No other
action occurs. The auto_selection_type component of the
callback structure will be set to XmAUTO_BEGIN.</p>

<p>ListButtonMotion(): If XmNselectionPolicy is set to
XmBROWSE_SELECT, this action deselects any current selection
and selects the item under the pointer. If
XmNautomaticSelection is set to True and the pointer has
entered a new list item, this action calls the
XmNbrowseSelectionCallback callbacks.</p>

<p>If XmNselectionPolicy is set to XmEXTENDED_SELECT, this
action does the following: If an extended selection is being
made and an extended selection has previously been made from
the current anchor point, restores the selection state of
the items in that range to their state before the previous
extended selection was done and changes the selection state
of the item under the pointer and all items between it and
the current anchor point to the state of the item at the
cur- rent anchor point. If XmNautomaticSelection is set to
True and the pointer has entered a new list item, calls the
XmNex- tendedSelectionCallback callbacks.</p>

<p>If the pointer leaves a scrolled list, this action
scrolls the list in the direction of the pointer motion. The
auto_selection_type component of the callback structure will
be set to XmAUTO_MOTION.</p>

<p>ListCopyToClipboard() Copies the content of the selected
items to the clipboard as a single compound string with each
item separated by a new- line. This action calls the
XmNconvertCallback procedures, possibly multiple times, for
the CLIPBOARD selection.</p>

<p>ListEndData(): Moves the location cursor to the last
item in the list. In Normal Mode, this also deselects any
current selection, selects the last item in the list, and
calls the appropriate selection callbacks
(XmNbrowseSelectionCallback when XmNse- lectionPolicy is set
to XmBROWSE_SELECT, XmNextendedSelec- tionCallback when
XmNselectionPolicy is set to XmEX- TENDED_SELECT).</p>

<p>ListEndDataExtend(): If XmNselectionPolicy is set to
XmMULTIPLE_SELECT or XmEX- TENDED_SELECT, this action moves
the location cursor to the last item in the list.</p>

<p>If XmNselectionPolicy is set to XmEXTENDED_SELECT, this
action does the following: If an extended selection has been
made from the current anchor point, restores the selection
state of the items in that range to their state before the
extended selection was done; changes the selection state of
the last item and all items between it and the current
anchor point to the state of the item at the current anchor
point; calls the XmNextendedSelectionCallback callbacks.</p>

<p>ListEndExtend(): If XmNselectionPolicy is set to
XmEXTENDED_SELECT, this action moves the location cursor to
the last item selected or deselected and calls the
XmNextendedSelectionCallback call- backs.</p>

<p>If XmNautomaticSelection is set to True, then the
auto_selec- tion_type field of the callback will be valid.
If XmNselec- tionPolicy is set to XmBROWSE_SELECT and the
currently selected item position matches the position of the
item that was selected before the browse selection began, or
if XmNse- lectionPolicy is set to XmEXTENDED_SELECT and the
set of cur- rently selected item positions matches the set
of item posi- tions selected before the extended selection
began, the call- back will be called with
auto_selection_type set to XmAUTO_NO_CHANGE. Otherwise, it
will be set to XmAUTO_CHANGE.</p>

<p>ListEndLine(): Moves the horizontal scroll region to the
end of the line.</p>

<p>ListEndSelect(): This action moves the location cursor
to the last item selected or deselected and calls the
appropriate selection callbacks (XmNsingleSelectionCallback
when XmNselectionPolicy is set to XmSINGLE_SELECT,
XmNbrowseSelectionCallback when XmNselectionPolicy is set to
XmBROWSE_SELECT, XmNmultipleSe- lectionCallback when
XmNselectionPolicy is set to XmMULTI- PLE_SELECT,
XmNextendedSelectionCallback when XmNselection- Policy is
set to XmEXTENDED_SELECT).</p>

<p>If XmNautomaticSelection is set to True, then the
auto_selec- tion_type field of the callback will be valid.
If XmNselec- tionPolicy is set to XmBROWSE_SELECT and the
currently selected item position matches the position of the
item that was selected before the brose selection began, or
if XmNse- lectionPolicy is set to XmEXTENDED_SELECT and the
set of cur- rently selected item positions matches the set
of item posi- tions selected before the extended selection
began, the call- back will be called with
auto_selection_type set to XmAUTO_NO_CHANGE. Otherwise, it
will be set to XmAUTO_CHANGE.</p>

<p>ListEndToggle(): If XmNselectionPolicy is set to
XmEXTENDED_SELECT, moves the location cursor to the last
item selected or deselected and calls the
XmNextendedSelectionCallback callbacks.</p>

<p>If XmNautomaticSelection is set to True, then the
auto_selec- tion_type field of the callback will be valid.
If XmNselec- tionPolicy is set to XmBROWSE_SELECT and the
currently selected item position matches the position of the
item that was selected before the browse selection began, or
if XmNse- lectionPolicy is set to XmEXTENDED_SELECT and the
set of cur- rently selected item positions matches the set
of item posi- tions selected before the extended selection
began, the call- back will be called with
auto_selection_type set to XmAUTO_NO_CHANGE. Otherwise, it
will be set to XmAUTO_CHANGE.</p>

<p>ListExtendNextItem(): If XmNselectionPolicy is set to
XmEXTENDED_SELECT, this action does the following: If an
extended selection has been made from the current anchor
point, restores the selection state of the items in that
range to their state before the extended selection was done;
moves the location cursor to the next item and changes the
selection state of the item and all items between it and the
current anchor point to the state of the item at the current
anchor point; calls the XmNextendedS- electionCallback
callbacks.</p>

<p>ListExtendPrevItem(): If XmNselectionPolicy is set to
XmEXTENDED_SELECT, this action does the following: If an
extended selection has been made from the current anchor
point, restores the selection state of the items in that
range to their state before the extended selection was done;
moves the location cursor to the previous item and changes
the selection state of the item and all items between it and
the current anchor point to the state of the item at the
current anchor point; calls the XmNextendedSelectionCallback
callbacks.</p>

<p>ListScrollCursorVertically(percentage): Scrolls the line
containing the insertion cursor vertically to an
intermediate position in the visible window based on an
input percentage. A value of 0 (zero) indicates the top of
the window; a value of 100, the bottom of the window. If
this action is called with no argument, the line containing
the insertion cursor is scrolled vertically to a new
position designated by the y event passed to the
routine.</p>

<p>ListKbdActivate(): Calls the callbacks for
XmNdefaultActionCallback. If the Lists parent is a manager,
this action passes the event to the parent.</p>

<p>ListKbdBeginExtend(): If XmNselectionPolicy is set to
XmEXTENDED_SELECT, does the following: If an extended
selection has been made from the current anchor point,
restores the selection state of the items in that range to
their state before the extended selec- tion was done;
changes the selection state of the item at the location
cursor and all items between it and the current anchor point
to the state of the item at the current anchor point. If
XmNautomaticSelection is set to True, this action calls the
XmNextendedSelectionCallback callbacks. The
auto_selection_type component of the callback structure will
be set to XmAUTO_BEGIN&quot;.</p>

<p>ListKbdBeginSelect(): If the XmNselectionPolicy is set
to XmSINGLE_SELECT, dese- lects any current selection and
toggles the state of the item at the location cursor. The
auto_selection_type component of the callback structure will
be set to XmAUTO_BEGIN&quot;.</p>

<p>If the XmNselectionPolicy is set to XmBROWSE_SELECT,
dese- lects any current selection and selects the item at
the loca- tion cursor. If XmNautomaticSelection is set to
True, calls the XmNbrowseSelectionCallback callbacks.</p>

<p>If the XmNselectionPolicy is set to XmMULTIPLE_SELECT,
tog- gles the selection state of the item at the location
cursor. Any previous selections remain.</p>

<p>If the XmNselectionPolicy is set to XmEXTENDED_SELECT,
moves the current anchor to the item at the location cursor.
In Normal Mode, this action deselects any current selection
and selects the item at the location cursor. In Add Mode,
this action toggles the selection state of the item at the
loca- tion cursor and leaves the current selection
unchanged. If XmNautomaticSelection is set to True, this
action calls the XmNextendedSelectionCallback callbacks. The
auto_selec- tion_type component of the callback structure
will be set to XmAUTO_BEGIN&quot;.</p>

<p>ListKbdCancel(): If XmNselectionPolicy is set to
XmEXTENDED_SELECT and an extended selection is being made
from the current anchor point, this action cancels the new
selection and restores the selection state of the items in
that range to their state before the extended selection was
done. If XmNautomaticSe- lection is set to True, this action
calls the XmNextendedSe- lectionCallback callbacks;
otherwise, if the parent is a man- ager, it passes the event
to the parent. The auto_selec- tion_type component of the
callback structure will be set to XmAUTO_CANCEL&quot;.</p>

<p>ListKbdDeSelectAll(): If the XmNselectionPolicy is set
to XmSINGLE_SELECT, XmMULTI- PLE_SELECT, or
XmEXTENDED_SELECT in Add Mode, this action deselects all
items in the list. If the XmNselectionPolicy is set to
XmEXTENDED_SELECT in Normal Mode, this action dese- lects
all items in the list (except the item at the location
cursor if the shells XmNkeyboardFocusPolicy is XmEXPLICIT).
This action also calls the appropriate selection callbacks
(XmNsingleSelectionCallback when XmNselectionPolicy is set
to XmSINGLE_SELECT, XmNmultipleSelectionCallback when

<p>ListKbdEndExtend(): If XmNselectionPolicy is set to
XmEXTENDED_SELECT, this action calls the
XmNextendedSelectionCallback callbacks.</p>

<p>If XmNautomaticSelection is set to True, then the
auto_selec- tion_type field of the callback will be valid.
If XmNselec- tionPolicy is set to XmBROWSE_SELECT and the
currently selected item position matches the position of the
item that was selected before the browse selection began, or
if XmNse- lectionPolicy is set to XmEXTENDED_SELECT and the
set of cur- rently selected item positions matches the set

this action also selects the next item, deselects any
current selection, and calls the XmNbrowseSelectionCallback
call- backs.</p>

<p>If the XmNselectionPolicy is set to XmEXTENDED_SELECT,
this action in Normal Mode also selects the next item,
deselects any current selection, moves the current anchor to
the next item, and calls the XmNextendedSelectionCallback
callbacks. In Add Mode, this action does not affect the
selection or the anchor.</p>

<p>ListNextPage(): Scrolls the list to the next page,
moving the location cursor to a new item.</p>

<p>If the XmNselectionPolicy is set to XmBROWSE_SELECT,
this action also selects the new item, deselects any current
selection, and calls the XmNbrowseSelectionCallback call-
backs.</p>

<p>If the XmNselectionPolicy is set to XmEXTENDED_SELECT,
this action in Normal Mode also selects the new item,
deselects any current selection, moves the current anchor to
the new item, and calls the XmNextendedSelectionCallback
callbacks. In Add Mode, this action does not affect the
selection or the anchor.</p>

<p>ListPrevItem(): Moves the location cursor to the
previous item in the list.</p>

<p>If the XmNselectionPolicy is set to XmBROWSE_SELECT,
this action also selects the previous item, deselects any
current selection, and calls the XmNbrowseSelectionCallback
call- backs.</p>

<p>If the XmNselectionPolicy is set to XmEXTENDED_SELECT,
this action in Normal Mode also selects the previous item,
dese- lects any current selection, moves the current anchor
to the previous item, and calls the

<p>ListProcessBtn1(string) When Displays
XmNenableBtn1Transfer resource is not XmOFF, the actions for
selection and transfer are integrated on &lt;Btn1&gt;. When
the button is not performing a transfer or drag, the action
that is performed depends on the value of string, which can
be one of the following actions:</p>

<p>&middot; ListButtonMotion</p>

<p>&middot; ListBeginExtend</p>

<p>&middot; ListEndExtend</p>

<p>&middot; ListBeginToggle</p>

<p>&middot; ListEndToggle</p>

<p>&middot; ListBeginSelect</p>

<p>&middot; ListEndSelect</p>

<p>ListProcessBtn2 When Displays XmNenableBtn1Transfer
resource has a value of XmBUTTON2_TRANSFER, the actions for
extending selection are bound on &lt;Btn2&gt;, and a drag
starts immediately. When Dis- play s XmNenableBtn1Transfer
resource has a value of XmBUT- TON2_ADJUST, the action that
is performed depends on the value of string, which can be
one of the following actions:</p>

<p>&middot; ListBeginExtend</p>

<p>&middot; ListButtonMotion</p>

<p>&middot; ListEndExtend</p>

<p>ListProcessDrag(): Drags the content of one or more
selected list items. Each item is separated by a newline. If
BTransfer is pressed on an unselected item, it drags only
that item, excluding any other selected items. This action
sets the XmNconvertProc of the DragContext to a function
that calls the XmNconvertCall- back procedures, possibly
multiple times, for the _MOTIF_DROP selection.</p>

<p>ListQuickNavigate Navigates to an item. When List s
XmNmatchBehavior resource is XmQUICK_NAVIGATE, this action
uses 1-character navigation to navigate. Refer to the
XmNmatchBehavior resource for a description of how this
navigation works.</p>

<p>ListRightChar(): Scrolls the list one character to the
right.</p>

<p>ListRightPage(): Scrolls the list one page to the
right.</p>

<p>PrimitiveHelp(): Calls the callbacks for XmNhelpCallback
if any exist. If there are no help callbacks for this
widget, this action calls the help callbacks for the nearest
ancestor that has them.</p>

<p>PrimitiveNextTabGroup(): Moves the focus to the first
item contained within the next tab group. If the current tab
group is the last entry in the tab group list, it wraps to
the beginning of the tab group list.</p>

<p>PrimitivePrevTabGroup(): Moves the focus to the first
item contained within the previ- ous tab group. If the
beginning of the tab group list is reached, it wraps to the
end of the tab group list.</p>

<p>Additional Behavior The List widget has the following
additional behavior:</p>

<p>&lt;Double Click&gt; If a button click is followed by
another button click within the time span specified by the
display s multiclick time, the List interprets that as a
double click and calls the call- backs for
XmNdefaultActionCallback. The items colors invert to
indicate that it is selected. The XmNdoubleClickInterval
resource can be used to specify a time span that overrides
the displays multi-click time.</p>

<p>&lt;FocusIn&gt;: If the focus policy is Explicit, this
action sets the focus and draw the location cursor.</p>

<p>&lt;FocusOut&gt;: If the focus policy is Explicit, this
action removes the focus and erase the location cursor.</p>
