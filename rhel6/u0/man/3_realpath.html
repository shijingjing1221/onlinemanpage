<p>REALPATH(3) Linux Programmer s Manual REALPATH(3)</p>

<p>NAME realpath - return the canonicalized absolute
pathname</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;limits.h&gt; #include
&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</p>

<p>char *realpath(const char *path, char
*resolved_path);</p>

<p>Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
feature_test_macros(7)):</p>

<p>realpath(): _BSD_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;= 500</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION realpath() expands all symbolic links and
resolves references to /./, /../ and extra &rsquo;/&rsquo;
characters in the null-terminated string named by path to
produce a canonicalized absolute pathname. The resulting
path- name is stored as a null-terminated string, up to a
maximum of PATH_MAX bytes, in the buffer pointed to by
resolved_path. The resulting path will have no symbolic
link, /./ or /../ components.</p>

<p>If resolved_path is specified as NULL, then realpath()
uses malloc(3) to allocate a buffer of up to PATH_MAX bytes
to hold the resolved path- name, and returns a pointer to
this buffer. The caller should deallo- cate this buffer
using free(3).</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE If there is no error, realpath() returns a
pointer to the resolved_path.</p>

<p>Otherwise it returns a NULL pointer, and the contents of
the array resolved_path are undefined, and errno is set to
indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS EACCES Read or search permission was denied for a
component of the path prefix.</p>

<p>EINVAL Either path or resolved_path is NULL. (In libc5
this would just cause a segfault.) But, see NOTES below.</p>

<p>EIO An I/O error occurred while reading from the file
system.</p>

<p>ELOOP Too many symbolic links were encountered in
translating the pathname.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG A component of a pathname exceeded NAME_MAX
characters, or an entire pathname exceeded PATH_MAX
characters.</p>

<p>ENOENT The named file does not exist.</p>

<p>ENOTDIR A component of the path prefix is not a
directory.</p>

<p>VERSIONS On Linux this function appeared in libc
4.5.21.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO 4.4BSD, POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>POSIX.1-2001 says that the behavior if resolved_path is
NULL is imple- mentation-defined. POSIX.1-2008 specifies the
behavior described in this page.</p>

<p>NOTES In 4.4BSD and Solaris the limit on the pathname
length is MAXPATHLEN (found in &lt;sys/param.h&gt;). SUSv2
prescribes PATH_MAX and NAME_MAX, as found in
&lt;limits.h&gt; or provided by the pathconf(3) function. A
typical source fragment would be</p>

<p>#ifdef PATH_MAX path_max = PATH_MAX; #else path_max =
pathconf(path, _PC_PATH_MAX); if (path_max &lt;= 0) path_max
= 4096; #endif</p>

<p>(But see the BUGS section.)</p>

<p>The 4.4BSD, Linux and SUSv2 versions always return an
absolute path- name. Solaris may return a relative pathname
when the path argument is relative. The prototype of
realpath() is given in &lt;unistd.h&gt; in libc4 and libc5,
but in &lt;stdlib.h&gt; everywhere else.</p>

<p>BUGS The POSIX.1-2001 standard version of this function
is broken by design, since it is impossible to determine a
suitable size for the output buffer, resolved_path.
According to POSIX.1-2001 a buffer of size PATH_MAX
suffices, but PATH_MAX need not be a defined constant, and
may have to be obtained using pathconf(3). And asking
pathconf(3) does not really help, since, on the one hand
POSIX warns that the result of pathconf(3) may be huge and
unsuitable for mallocing memory, and on the other hand
pathconf(3) may return -1 to signify that PATH_MAX is not
bounded. The resolved_path == NULL feature, not standardized
in POSIX.1-2001, but standardized in POSIX.1-2008, allows
this design problem to be avoided.</p>

<p>The libc4 and libc5 implementation contains a buffer
overflow (fixed in libc-5.4.13). Thus, set-user-ID programs
like mount(8) need a private version.</p>
