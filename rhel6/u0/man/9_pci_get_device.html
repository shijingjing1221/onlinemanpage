PCI_GET_DEVICE(9)</p>

<p>NAME pci_get_device - begin or continue searching for a
PCI device by vendor/device id</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS struct pci_dev * pci_get_device(unsigned int
vendor, unsigned int device, struct pci_dev * from);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS vendor PCI vendor id to match, or PCI_ANY_ID
to match all vendor ids</p>

<p>device PCI device id to match, or PCI_ANY_ID to match
all device ids</p>

<p>from Previous PCI device found in search, or NULL for
new search.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Iterates through the list of known PCI
devices. If a PCI device is found with a matching vendor and
device, the reference count to the device is incremented and
a pointer to its device structure is returned. Otherwise,
NULL is returned. A new search is initiated by passing NULL
as the from argument. Otherwise if from is not NULL,
searches continue from next device on the global list. The
reference count for from is always decremented if it is not
NULL.</p>
