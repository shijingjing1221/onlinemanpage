<p>NAME httpd - Apache Hypertext Transfer Protocol
Server</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS httpd [ -d serverroot ] [ -f config ] [ -C
directive ] [ -c directive ] [ -D parameter ] [ -e level ] [
-E file ] [ -k start|restart|grace- ful|stop|graceful-stop ]
[ -R directory ] [ -h ] [ -l ] [ -L ] [ -S ] [ -t ] [ -v ] [
-V ] [ -X ] [ -M ]</p>

<p>On Windows systems, the following additional arguments
are available:</p>

<p>httpd [ -k install|config|uninstall ] [ -n name ] [ -w
]</p>

<p>SUMMARY httpd is the Apache HyperText Transfer Protocol
(HTTP) server program. It is designed to be run as a
standalone daemon process. When used like this it will
create a pool of child processes or threads to handle
requests.</p>

<p>In general, httpd should not be invoked directly, but
rather should be invoked via apachectl on Unix-based systems
or as a service on Windows NT, 2000 and XP and as a console
application on Windows 9x and ME.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -d serverroot Set the initial value for the
ServerRoot directive to server- root. This can be overridden
by the ServerRoot directive in the configuration file. The
default is /etc/httpd.</p>

<p>-f config Uses the directives in the file config on
startup. If config does not begin with a /, then it is taken
to be a path relative to the ServerRoot. The default is
conf/httpd.conf.</p>

<p>-k start|restart|graceful|stop|graceful-stop Signals
httpd to start, restart, or stop. See Stopping Apache for
more information.</p>

<p>-C directive Process the configuration directive before
reading config files.</p>

<p>-c directive Process the configuration directive after
reading config files.</p>

<p>-D parameter Sets a configuration parameter which can be
used with &lt;IfDefine&gt; sections in the configuration
files to conditionally skip or process commands at server
startup and restart. Also can be used to set certain
less-common startup parameters including -DNO_DETACH
(prevent the parent from forking) and -DFOREGROUND (prevent
the parent from calling setsid() et al).</p>

<p>-e level Sets the LogLevel to level during server
startup. This is useful for temporarily increasing the
verbosity of the error messages to find problems during
startup.</p>

<p>-E file Send error messages during server startup to
file.</p>

<p>-R directory When the server is compiled using the
SHARED_CORE rule, this specifies the directory for the
shared object files.</p>

<p>-h Output a short summary of available command line
options.</p>

<p>-l Output a list of modules compiled into the server.
This will not list dynamically loaded modules included using
the LoadModule directive.</p>

<p>-L Output a list of directives together with expected
arguments and places where the directive is valid.</p>

<p>-M Dump a list of loaded Static and Shared Modules.</p>

<p>-S Show the settings as parsed from the config file
(currently only shows the virtualhost settings).</p>

<p>-t Run syntax tests for configuration files only. The
program imme- diately exits after these syntax parsing tests
with either a return code of 0 (Syntax OK) or return code
not equal to 0 (Syn- tax Error). If -D DUMP_VHOSTS is also
set, details of the vir- tual host configuration will be
printed. If -D DUMP_MODULES is set, all loaded modules will
be printed.</p>

<p>-v Print the version of httpd, and then exit.</p>

<p>-V Print the version and build parameters of httpd, and
then exit.</p>

<p>-X Run httpd in debug mode. Only one worker will be
started and the server will not detach from the console.</p>

<p>The following arguments are available only on the
Windows platform:</p>

<p>-k install|config|uninstall Install Apache as a Windows
NT service; change startup options for the Apache service;
and uninstall the Apache service.</p>

<p>-n name The name of the Apache service to signal.</p>

<p>-w Keep the console window open on error so that the
error message can be read.</p>
