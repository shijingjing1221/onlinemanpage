<p>NAME omshell - OMAPI Command Shell</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS omshell</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The OMAPI Command Shell, omshell, provides
an interactive way to con- nect to, query, and possibly
change, the ISC DHCP Servers state via OMAPI, the Object
Management API. By using OMAPI and omshell, you do not have
to stop, make changes, and then restart the DHCP server, but
can make the changes while the server is running. Omshell
provides a way of accessing OMAPI.</p>

<p>OMAPI is simply a communications mechanism that allows
you to manipu- late objects. In order to actually use
omshell, you must understand what objects are available and
how to use them. Documentation for OMAPI objects can be
found in the documentation for the server that provides them
- for example, in the dhcpd(1) manual page and the
dhclient(1) manual page.</p>

<p>CONTRIBUTIONS This software is free software. At various
times its development has been underwritten by various
organizations, including the ISC and Vixie Enterprises. The
development of 3.0 has been funded almost entirely by
Nominum, Inc.</p>

<p>At this point development is being shepherded by Ted
Lemon, and hosted by the ISC, but the future of this project
depends on you. If you have features you want, please
consider implementing them.</p>

<p>LOCAL AND REMOTE OBJECTS Throughout this document, there
are references to local and remote objects. Local objects
are ones created in omshell with the new com- mand. Remote
objects are ones on the server: leases, hosts, and groups
that the DHCP server knows about. Local and remote objects
are associ- ated together to enable viewing and modification
of object attributes. Also, new remote objects can be
created to match local objects.</p>

<p>OPENING A CONNECTION omshell is started from the command
line. Once omshell is started, there are several commands
that can be issued:</p>

<p>server address where address is the IP address of the
DHCP server to connect to. If this is not specified, the
default server is 127.0.0.1 (local- host).</p>

<p>port number where number is the port that OMAPI listens
on. By default, this is 7911.</p>

<p>key name secret This specifies the TSIG key to use to
authenticate the OMAPI transactions. name is the name of a
key defined in dhcpd.conf with the omapi-key statement. The
secret is the secret key gener- ated from dnssec-keygen or
another key generation program.</p>

<p>connect This starts the OMAPI connection to the server
as specified by the server statement.</p>

<p>CREATING LOCAL OBJECTS Any object defined in OMAPI can
be created, queried, and/or modified. The object types
available to OMAPI are defined in dhcpd(8) and dhclient(8).
When using omshell, objects are first defined locally,
manipulated as desired, and then associated with an object
on the server. Only one object can be manipulated at a time.
To create a local object, use</p>

<p>new object-type object-type is one of group, host, or
lease.</p>

<p>At this point, you now have an object that you can set
properties on. For example, if a new lease object was
created with new lease, any of a leases attributes can be
set as follows:</p>

<p>set attribute-name = value Attribute names are defined
in dhcpd(8) and dhclient(8). Values should be quoted if they
are strings. So, to set a leases IP address, you would do
the following: set ip-address = 192.168.4.50</p>

<p>ASSOCIATING LOCAL AND REMOTE OBJECTS At this point, you
can query the server for information about this lease,
by</p>

<p>open</p>

<p>Now, the local lease object you created and set the IP
address for is associated with the corresponding lease
object on the DHCP server. All of the lease attributes from
the DHCP server are now also the attributes on the local
object, and will be shown in omshell.</p>

<p>VIEWING A REMOTE OBJECT To query a lease of address
192.168.4.50, and find out its attributes, after connecting
to the server, take the following steps:</p>

<p>new lease</p>

<p>This creates a new local lease object.</p>

<p>set ip-address = 192.168.4.50</p>

<p>This sets the local objects IP address to be
192.168.4.50</p>

<p>open</p>

<p>Now, if a lease with that IP address exists, you will
see all the information the DHCP server has about that
particular lease. Any data that isn t readily printable text
will show up in colon-separated hex- adecimal values. In
this example, output back from the server for the entire
transaction might look like this:</p>

<p>&gt; new &quot;lease&quot; obj: lease &gt; set
ip-address = 192.168.4.50 obj: lease ip-address =
c0:a8:04:32 &gt; open obj: lease ip-address = c0:a8:04:32
state = 00:00:00:02 dhcp-client-identifier =
01:00:10:a4:b2:36:2c client-hostname = &quot;wendelina&quot;
subnet = 00:00:00:06 pool = 00:00:00:07 hardware-address =
00:10:a4:b2:36:2c hardware-type = 00:00:00:01 ends =
dc:d9:0d:3b starts = 5c:9f:04:3b tstp = 00:00:00:00 tsfp =
00:00:00:00 cltt = 00:00:00:00</p>

<p>As you can see here, the IP address is represented in
hexadecimal, as are the starting and ending times of the
lease.</p>

<p>MODIFYING A REMOTE OBJECT Attributes of remote objects
are updated by using the set command as before, and then
issuing an update command. The set command sets the
attributes on the current local object, and the update
command pushes those changes out to the server.</p>

<p>Continuing with the previous example, if a set
client-hostname = &quot;some- thing-else&quot; was issued,
followed by an update command, the output would look about
like this:</p>

<p>&gt; set client-hostname = &quot;something-else&quot;
obj: lease ip-address = c0:a8:04:32 state = 00:00:00:02
dhcp-client-identifier = 01:00:10:a4:b2:36:2c
client-hostname = &quot;something-else&quot; subnet =
00:00:00:06 pool = 00:00:00:07 hardware-address =
00:10:a4:b2:36:2c hardware-type = 00:00:00:01 ends =
dc:d9:0d:3b starts = 5c:9f:04:3b tstp = 00:00:00:00 tsfp =
00:00:00:00 cltt = 00:00:00:00 &gt; update obj: lease
ip-address = c0:a8:04:32 state = 00:00:00:02
dhcp-client-identifier = 01:00:10:a4:b2:36:2c
client-hostname = &quot;something-else&quot; subnet =
00:00:00:06 pool = 00:00:00:07 hardware-address =
00:10:a4:b2:36:2c hardware-type = 00:00:00:01 ends =
dc:d9:0d:3b starts = 5c:9f:04:3b tstp = 00:00:00:00 tsfp =
00:00:00:00 cltt = 00:00:00:00</p>

<p>NEW REMOTE OBJECTS New remote objects are created much
in the same way that existing server objects are modified.
Create a local object using new, set the attributes as youd
wish them to be, and then create the remote object with the
same properties by using</p>

<p>create</p>

<p>Now a new object exists on the DHCP server which matches
the properties that you gave your local object. Objects
created via OMAPI are saved into the dhcpd.leases file.</p>

<p>For example, if a new host with the IP address of
192.168.4.40 needs to be created it would be done as
follows:</p>

<p>&gt; new host obj: host &gt; set name =
&quot;some-host&quot; obj: host name = &quot;some-host&quot;
&gt; set hardware-address = 00:80:c7:84:b1:94 obj: host name
= &quot;some-host&quot; hardware-address = 00:80:c7:84:b1:94
&gt; set hardware-type = 1 obj: host name =
&quot;some-host&quot; hardware-address = 00:80:c7:84:b1:94
hardware-type = 1 &gt; set ip-address = 192.168.4.40 obj:
host name = &quot;some-host&quot; hardware-address =
00:80:c7:84:b1:94 hardware-type = 1 ip-address = c0:a8:04:28
&gt; create obj: host name = &quot;some-host&quot;
hardware-address = 00:80:c7:84:b1:94 hardware-type =
00:00:00:01 ip-address = c0:a8:04:28 &gt;</p>

<p>Your dhcpd.leases file would then have an entry like
this in it:</p>

<p>host some-host { dynamic; hardware ethernet
00:80:c7:84:b1:94; fixed-address 192.168.4.40; }</p>

<p>The dynamic; line is to denote that this host entry did
not come from dhcpd.conf, but was created dynamically via
OMAPI.</p>

<p>RESETTING ATTRIBUTES If you want to remove an attribute
from an object, you can do this with the unset command. Once
you have unset an attribute, you must use the update command
to update the remote object. So, if the host &quot;some-
host&quot; from the previous example will not have a static
IP address any- more, the commands in omshell would look
like this:</p>

<p>obj: host name = &quot;some-host&quot; hardware-address
= 00:80:c7:84:b1:94 hardware-type = 00:00:00:01 ip-address =
c0:a8:04:28 &gt; unset ip-address obj: host name =
&quot;some-host&quot; hardware-address = 00:80:c7:84:b1:94
hardware-type = 00:00:00:01 ip-address = &lt;null&gt;
&gt;</p>

<p>REFRESHING OBJECTS A local object may be refreshed with
the current remote object proper- ties using the refresh
command. This is useful for object that change periodically,
like leases, to see if they have been updated. This isnt
particularly useful for hosts.</p>

<p>DELETING OBJECTS Any remote object that can be created
can also be destroyed. This is done by creating a new local
object, setting attributes, associating the local and remote
object using open, and then using the remove com- mand. If
the host &quot;some-host&quot; from before was created in
error, this could be corrected as follows:</p>

<p>obj: host name = &quot;some-host&quot; hardware-address
= 00:80:c7:84:b1:94 hardware-type = 00:00:00:01 ip-address =
c0:a8:04:28 &gt; remove obj: &lt;null&gt; &gt;</p>

<p>HELP The help command will print out all of the commands
available in omshell, with some syntax pointers.</p>
