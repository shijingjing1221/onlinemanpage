<p>NAME ata_finalize_port_ops - finalize
ata_port_operations</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS void ata_finalize_port_ops(struct
ata_port_operations * ops);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS ops ata_port_operations to finalize</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION An ata_port_operations can inherit from
another ops and that ops can again inherit from another.
This can go on as many times as necessary as long as there
is no loop in the inheritance chain.</p>

<p>Ops tables are finalized when the host is started. NULL
or unspecified entries are inherited from the closet
ancestor which has the method and the entry is populated
with it. After finalization, the ops table directly points
to all the methods and -&gt;inherits is no longer necessary
and cleared.</p>

<p>Using ATA_OP_NULL, inheriting ops can force a method to
NULL.</p>

<p>LOCKING None.</p>
