<p>NAME rpmelfsym - list symbols from object files in RPM
packages</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rpmelfsym [-h] [-p] [FILE...] [DIR...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION rpmelfsym produces three-column output: file
name, symbol type, and symbol name, as determined by nm(1).
Only dynamically linked executable files and shared
libraries are processed, and only dynamic symbols are
listed. When processing a directory, an additional column is
prepended to the output, which is typically RPM file
basename.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -p When processing a directory, list package
names, not file names; furthermore, enable special treatment
of packages with the same name; that is, process only the
one with the latest version.</p>

<p>-h Display this help and exit.</p>
