<p>QUOTACTL(2) QUOTACTL(2)</p>

<p>NAME quotactl - manipulate disk quotas</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/quota.h&gt; #include
&lt;sys/types.h&gt; #include &lt;xfs/xqm.h&gt;</p>

<p>long quotactl(int cmd, charspecial, int id, caddr_t
addr)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The quotactl() call manipulates disk quotas.
cmd indicates a command to be applied to UID id or GID id.
To set the type of quota use the QCMD(cmd, type) macro.
special is a pointer to a null-terminated string containing
the path name of the block special device for the filesystem
being manipulated. addr is the address of an optional, com-
mand specific, data structure which is copied in or out of
the system. The interpretation of addr is given with each
command below.</p>

<p>Q_QUOTAON Turn on quotas for a filesystem. id is the
identifica- tion number of the quota format to be used.
Format num- bers are defined in the header file of
appropriate for- mat. Currently there are two supported
quota formats whose numbers are defined by constants
QFMT_VFS_OLD (original quota format) and QFMT_VFS_V0 (new
VFS v0 quota format). addr points to the path name of file
containing the quotas for the filesystem. The quota file
must exist; it is normally created with the quo- tacheck(8)
program. This call is restricted to the super-user.</p>

<p>Q_QUOTAOFF Turn off quotas for a filesystem. addr and id
are ignored. This call is restricted to the super-user.</p>

<p>Q_GETQUOTA Get disk quota limits and current usage for
user or group id. addr is a pointer to an dqblk structure
(defined in &lt;sys/quota.h&gt;). The field dqb_valid
defines the entries in the structure which are set
correctly. On Q_GETQUOTA call all entries are valid. Only
the super- user may get the quotas of a user other than
himself.</p>

<p>Q_SETQUOTA Set current quota information for user or
group id. addr is a pointer to an dqblk structure (defined
in &lt;sys/quota.h&gt;). The field dqb_valid defines which
entries in the quota structure are valid and should be set.
The constants for dqb_valid field are defined in the
&lt;sys/quota.h&gt; header file. This call obsoletes calls
Q_SETQLIM and Q_SETUSE in the previous quota interfaces.
This call is restricted to the super-user.</p>

<p>Q_GETINFO Get information (like grace times) about
quotafile. addr should be a pointer to an dqinfo structure
(defined in &lt;sys/quota.h&gt;). The dqi_valid field in the
structure defines entries in it which are valid. On
Q_GETINFO call all entries are valid. Parameter id is
ignored.</p>

<p>Q_SETINFO Set information about quotafile. addr should
be a pointer to dqinfo structure (defined in
&lt;sys/quota.h&gt;). The field dqi_valid defines which
entries in the quota info structure are valid and should be
set. The con- stants for dqi_valid field are defined in the
&lt;sys/quota.h&gt; header file. This call obsoletes calls
Q_SETGRACE and Q_SETFLAGS in the previous quota inter-
faces. Parameter id is ignored. This operation is restricted
to super-user.</p>

<p>Q_GETFMT Get quota format used on the specified
filesystem. addr should be a pointer to a memory (4 bytes)
where the for- mat number will be stored.</p>

<p>Q_SYNC Update the on-disk copy of quota usages for a
filesys- tem. If special is null then all filesystems with
active quotas are synced. addr and id are ignored.</p>

<p>Q_GETSTATS Get statistics and other generic information
about quota subsystem. addr should be a pointer to dqstats
struc- ture (defined in &lt;sys/quota.h&gt;) in which data
should be stored. special and id are ignored.</p>

<p>For XFS filesystems making use of the XFS Quota Manager
(XQM), the above commands are bypassed and the following
commands are used:</p>

<p>Q_XQUOTAON Turn on quotas for an XFS filesystem. XFS
provides the ability to turn on/off quota limit enforcement
with quota accounting. Therefore, XFS expects the addr to be
a pointer to an unsigned int that contains either the flags
XFS_QUOTA_UDQ_ACCT and/or XFS_QUOTA_UDQ_ENFD (for user
quota), or XFS_QUOTA_GDQ_ACCT and/or XFS_QUOTA_GDQ_ENFD (for
group quota), as defined in &lt;xfs/xqm.h&gt;. This call is
restricted to the superuser.</p>

<p>Q_XQUOTAOFF Turn off quotas for an XFS filesystem. As in
Q_QUOTAON, XFS filesystems expect a pointer to an unsigned
int that specifies whether quota accounting and/or limit
enforce- ment need to be turned off. This call is restricted
to the superuser.</p>

<p>Q_XGETQUOTA Get disk quota limits and current usage for
user id. addr is a pointer to a fs_disk_quota structure
(defined in &lt;xfs/xqm.h&gt;). Only the superuser may get
the quotas of a user other than himself.</p>

<p>Q_XSETQLIM Set disk quota limits for user id. addr is a
pointer to a fs_disk_quota structure (defined in
&lt;xfs/xqm.h&gt;). This call is restricted to the
superuser.</p>

<p>Q_XGETQSTAT Returns a fs_quota_stat structure containing
XFS filesystem specific quota information. This is useful in
finding out how much space is spent to store quota
information, and also to get quotaon/off status of a given
local XFS filesystem.</p>

<p>Q_XQUOTARM Free the disk space taken by disk quotas.
Quotas must have already been turned off.</p>

<p>There is no command equivalent to Q_SYNC for XFS since
sync(1) writes quota information to disk (in addition to the
other filesystem metadata it writes out).</p>

<p>RETURN VALUES quotactl() returns:</p>

<p>0 on success.</p>

<p>-1 on failure and sets errno to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS EFAULT addr or special are invalid.</p>

<p>ENOSYS The kernel has not been compiled with the QUOTA
option.</p>

<p>EINVAL</p>

<p>cmd or type is invalid.</p>

<p>ENOENT The file specified by special or addr does not
exist.</p>

<p>ENOTBLK special is not a block device.</p>

<p>EPERM The call is privileged and the caller was not the
super- user.</p>

<p>ESRCH No disc quota is found for the indicated user.</p>

<p>Quotas have not been turned on for this filesystem.</p>

<p>If cmd is Q_QUOTAON, quotactl() may set errno to:</p>

<p>EACCES The quota file pointed to by addr exists but is
not a regular file.</p>

<p>The quota file pointed to by addr exists but is not on
the filesystem pointed to by special.</p>

<p>EINVAL The quota file is corrupted.</p>

<p>ESRCH Specified quota format was not found.</p>

<p>EBUSY Q_QUOTAON attempted while another Q_QUOTAON has
already taken place.</p>
