<p>mcat(1) mcat(1)</p>

<p>Name mcat - dump raw disk image</p>

<p>Note of warning This manpage has been automatically
generated from mtoolss texinfo documentation, and may not be
entirely accurate or complete. See the end of this man page
for details.</p>

<p>Description The mcat command is used to copy an entire
disk image from or to the floppy device. It uses the
following syntax:</p>

<p>mcat [-w] drive:</p>

<p>Mcat performs the same task as the unix cat command. It
is included into the mtools package, since cat cannot access
remote floppy devices offered by the mtools floppy daemon.
Now it is possible to create boot floppies remotely.</p>

<p>The default operation is reading. The output is written
to stdout.</p>

<p>If the -w option is specified, mcat reads a disk-image
from stdin and writes it to the given device. Use this
carefully! Because of the lowlevel nature of this command,
it will happily destroy any data writ- ten before on the
disk without warning!</p>

<p>Viewing the texi doc This manpage has been automatically
generated from mtoolss texinfo documentation. However, this
process is only approximative, and some items, such as
crossreferences, footnotes and indices are lost in this
translation process. Indeed, these items have no appropriate
represen- tation in the manpage format. Moreover, not all
information has been translated into the manpage version.
Thus I strongly advise you to use the original texinfo doc.
See the end of this manpage for instructions how to view the
texinfo doc.</p>

<p>* To generate a printable copy from the texinfo doc, run
the fol- lowing commands:</p>

<p>./configure; make dvi; dvips mtools.dvi</p>

<p>* To generate a html copy, run:</p>

<p>./configure; make html</p>

<p>A premade html can be found at http://www.gnu.org/soft-
ware/mtools/manual/mtools.html</p>

<p>* To generate an info copy (browsable using emacs info
mode), run:</p>

<p>./configure; make info</p>

<p>The texinfo doc looks most pretty when printed or as
html. Indeed, in the info version certain examples are
difficult to read due to the quoting conventions used in
info.</p>
