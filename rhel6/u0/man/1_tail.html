<p>NAME tail - output the last part of files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS tail [OPTION]... [FILE]...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Print the last 10 lines of each FILE to
standard output. With more than one FILE, precede each with
a header giving the file name. With no FILE, or when FILE is
-, read standard input.</p>

<p>Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for
short options too.</p>

<p>-c, --bytes=K output the last K bytes; alternatively,
use -c +K to output bytes starting with the Kth of each
file</p>

<p>-f, --follow[={name|descriptor}] output appended data as
the file grows; -f, --follow, and --fol- low=descriptor are
equivalent</p>

<p>-F same as --follow=name --retry</p>

<p>-n, --lines=K output the last K lines, instead of the
last 10; or use -n +K to output lines starting with the
Kth</p>

<p>--max-unchanged-stats=N with --follow=name, reopen a
FILE which has not changed size after N (default 5)
iterations to see if it has been unlinked or renamed (this
is the usual case of rotated log files)</p>

<p>--pid=PID with -f, terminate after process ID, PID
dies</p>

<p>-q, --quiet, --silent never output headers giving file
names</p>

<p>--retry keep trying to open a file even when it is or
becomes inaccessi- ble; useful when following by name, i.e.,
with --follow=name</p>

<p>-s, --sleep-interval=N with -f, sleep for approximately
N seconds (default 1.0) between iterations</p>

<p>-v, --verbose always output headers giving file
names</p>

<p>--help display this help and exit</p>

<p>--version output version information and exit</p>

<p>If the first character of K (the number of bytes or
lines) is a +, print beginning with the Kth item from the
start of each file, other- wise, print the last K items in
the file. K may have a multiplier suf- fix: b 512, kB 1000,
K 1024, MB 1000*1000, M 1024*1024, GB 1000*1000*1000, G
1024*1024*1024, and so on for T, P, E, Z, Y.</p>

<p>With --follow (-f), tail defaults to following the file
descriptor, which means that even if a tailed file is
renamed, tail will continue to track its end. This default
behavior is not desirable when you really want to track the
actual name of the file, not the file descrip- tor (e.g.,
log rotation). Use --follow=name in that case. That causes
tail to track the named file in a way that accommodates
renaming, removal and creation.</p>
