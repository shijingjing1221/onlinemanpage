<p>GFTOPK(1) GFTOPK(1)</p>

<p>NAME gftopk - convert generic font files to packed font
files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS gftopk [ -v ] gf_file_name [ pk_file_name ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page is not meant to be
exhaustive. The complete documen- tation for this version of
TeX can be found in the info file or manual Web2C: A TeX
implementation.</p>

<p>The gftopk program converts a generic font file output
by, for example, mf(1), to a packed font file for use by
DVI-reading programs. Packed font files (pk files) are much
smaller than the corresponding gf files, so they are
generally the font format of choice.</p>

<p>The gf_file_name on the command line must be complete.
Because the res- olution is part of the extension, it would
not make sense to append a default extension as is done with
TeX or DVI-reading software. The pk_file_name defaults to
the same (stripped) name as gf_file_name, and it is placed
in the current working directory with the pk suffix
replacing gf. For example, the input file cmr10.300gf would
become cmr10.300pk.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Unless the -v switch is given, gftopk operates
silently. With -v, the version number of the program and
statistics about the packing are out- put to stdout.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT gftopk looks for gf_file_name first in the
current directory. If it is not present there, it uses the
environment variable GFFONTS. If that is not set, it uses
the variable TEXFONTS. If that is not set, it uses the
system default.</p>

<p>See tex(1) for the details of the searching.</p>

<p>AUTHORS Tomas Rokicki wrote the program. It was
published as part of the Meta- fontware technical report,
available from the TeX Users Group. Paul Richards originally
ported it to Unix.</p>
