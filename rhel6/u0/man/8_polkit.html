<p>NAME polkit - Authorization Framework</p>

<p>OVERVIEW PolicyKit provides an authorization API
intended to be used by privileged programs ( MECHANISMS )
offering service to unprivileged programs (CLIENTS) through
some form of IPC mechanism such as D-Bus or Unix pipes. In
this scenario, the mechanism typically treats the client as
untrusted. For every request from a client, the mechanism
needs to determine if the request is authorized or if it
should refuse to service the client. Using the PolicyKit
API, a mechanism can offload this decision to a trusted
party: The PolicyKit Authority.</p>

<p>In addition to acting as an authority, PolicyKit allows
users to obtain temporary authorization through
authenticating either an administrative user or the owner of
the session the client belongs to. This is useful for
scenarios where a mechanism needs to verify that the
operator of the system really is the user or really is an
administrative user.</p>

<p>SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE The system architecture of PolicyKit
is comprised of the Authority (implemented as a service on
the system message bus) and a Authentication Agent per user
session (provided and started by the user session e.g. GNOME
or KDE). Additionally, PolicyKit supports a number of
extension points specifically, vendors and/or sites can
write extensions to completely control authorization policy.
In a block diagram, the architecture looks like this:</p>

<p>[IMAGE][1]</p>

<p>+-------------------+ | Authentication | | Agent |
+-------------------+ | libpolkit-agent-1 |
+-------------------+ ^ +--------+ | | Client |
+--------------+ +--------+ | ^ | | User Session | |
=======================|========================|=============
System Context | | | | | +---+ V | /------------ | | System

+------------------+ +---------------------+ |
org.freedesktop. | | PolicyKit1 | +------------------+ |
Backends and | | Extensions | +------------------+</p>

<p>For convenience, the libpolkit-gobject-1 library wraps
the PolicyKit D-Bus API using GObject. However, a mechanism
can also use the D-Bus API or the pkcheck(1) command to
check authorizations.</p>

<p>The libpolkit-agent-1 library provides an abstraction of
the native authentication system, e.g. pam(8) and also
facilities registration and communication with the PolicyKit
D-Bus service.</p>

<p>PolicyKit extensions and authority backends are
implemented using the libpolkit-backend-1 library.</p>

<p>See the developer documentation[2] for more information
about using and extending PolicyKit.</p>

<p>See pklocalauthority(8) for information about the Local
Authority - the default authority implementation shipped
with PolicyKit.</p>

<p>AUTHENTICATION AGENTS An authentication agent is used to
make the user of a session prove that the user of the
session really is the user (by authenticating as the user)
or an administrative user (by authenticating as a
administrator). In order to integrate well with the rest of
the user session (e.g. match the look and feel),
authentication agents are meant to be provided by the user
session that the user uses. For example, an authentication
agent may look like this:</p>

<p>[IMAGE][3]</p>

| | | [Icon] Authentication is required to run ATA SMART | |
self tests | | | | An application is attempting to perform
an | | action that requires privileges. Authentication | |

+----------------------------------------------------------+</p>

<p>If the system is configured without a root account it
may allow you to select the administrative user who is
authenticating:</p>

<p>See pklocalauthority(8) on how to set up the local
authority implemention for systems without a root
account.</p>

<p>DECLARING ACTIONS A mechanism need to declare a set of
ACTIONS in order to use PolicyKit. Actions correspond to
operations that clients can request the mechanism to carry
out and are defined in XML files that the mechanism installs
into the /usr/share/polkit-1/actions directory.</p>

<p>PolicyKit actions are namespaced and can only contain
the characters [a-z][0-9].- e.g. lower-case ASCII, digits,
period and hyphen. Each XML file can contain more than one
action but all actions need to be in the same namespace and
the file needs to be named after the namespace and have the
extension .policy.</p>

<p>The XML file must have the following doctype
declaration</p>

<p>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;
encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE policyconfig
PUBLIC &quot;-//freedesktop//DTD PolicyKit Policy
Configuration 1.0//EN&quot;
&quot;http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/PolicyKit/1.0/policyconfig.dtd&quot;&gt;</p>

<p>The policyconfig element must be present exactly once.
Elements that can be used inside policyconfig includes:</p>

<p>vendor The name of the project or vendor that is
supplying the actions in the XML document. Optional.</p>

<p>vendor_url A URL to the project or vendor that is
supplying the actions in the XML document. Optional.</p>

<p>icon_name An icon representing the project or vendor
that is supplying the actions in the XML document. The icon
name must adhere to the Freedesktop.org Icon Naming
Specification[5]. Optional.</p>

<p>action Declares an action. The action name is specified
using the id attribute and can only contain the characters
[a-z][0-9].- e.g. lower-case ASCII, digits, period and
hyphen.</p>

<p>Elements that can be used inside action includes:</p>

<p>description A human readable description of the action,
e.g. Install unsigned software.</p>

<p>message A human readable message displayed to the user
when asking for credentials when authentication is needed,
e.g. Installing unsigned software requires
authentication.</p>

<p>defaults This element is used to specify implicit
authorizations for clients.</p>

<p>Elements that can be used inside defaults includes:</p>

<p>allow_any Implicit authorizations that apply to any
client. Optional.</p>

<p>allow_inactive Implicit authorizations that apply to
clients in inactive sessions on local consoles.
Optional.</p>

<p>allow_active Implicit authorizations that apply to
clients in active sessions on local consoles. Optional.</p>

<p>Each of the allow_any, allow_inactive and allow_active
elements can contain the following values:</p>

<p>no Not authorized.</p>

<p>yes Authorized.</p>

<p>auth_self Authentication by the owner of the session
that the client originates from is required.</p>

<p>auth_admin Authentication by an administrative user is
required.</p>

<p>auth_self_keep Like auth_self but the authorization is
kept for a brief period.</p>

<p>auth_admin_keep Like auth_admin but the authorization is
kept for a brief period.</p>

<p>annotate Used for annotating an action with a key/value
pair. The key is specified using the the key attribute and
the value is specified using the value attribute. This
element may appear zero or more times. See pkexec(1) for an
example of how this can be used.</p>

<p>vendor Used for overriding the vendor on a per-action
basis. Optional.</p>

<p>vendor_url Used for overriding the vendor URL on a
per-action basis. Optional.</p>

<p>icon_name Used for overriding the icon name on a
per-action basis. Optional.</p>

<p>For localization, description and message elements may
occur multiple times with different xml:lang attributes.</p>

<p>To list installed PolicyKit actions, use the pkaction(1)
command.</p>
