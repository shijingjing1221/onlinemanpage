<p>NAME stopped - event signalling that a job has
stopped</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS stopped JOB=JOB INSTANCE=INSTANCE RESULT=RESULT
[PROCESS=PROCESS] [EXIT_STATUS=STATUS] [EXIT_SIGNAL=SIGNAL]
[ENV]...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The stopped event is generated by the
Upstart init(8) daemon when an instance of a job has
stopped. The JOB environment variable contains the job name,
and the INSTANCE environment variable contains the instance
name which will be empty for single-instance jobs.</p>

<p>If the job was stopped normally, the RESULT environment
variable will be ok, otherwise if the job was stopped
because it has failed it will be failed.</p>

<p>When the job has failed, the process that failed will be
given in the PROCESS environment variable. This may be
pre-start, post-start, main, pre-stop or post-stop; it may
also be the special value respawn to indicate that the job
was stopped because it hit the respawn limit.</p>

<p>Finally in the case of a failed job, one of either
EXIT_STATUS or EXIT_SIGNAL may be given to indicate the
cause of the stop. Either EXIT_STATUS will contain the exit
status code of the process, or EXIT_SIGNAL will contain the
name of the signal that the process received. The normal
exit job configuration stanza can be used to pre- vent
particular exit status values or signals resulting in a
failed job, see init(5) for more information.</p>

<p>If neither EXIT_STATUS or EXIT_SIGNAL is given for a
failed process, it is because the process failed to spawn
(for example, file not found). See the system logs for the
error.</p>

<p>init(8) emits this event as an informational signal,
services and tasks started or stopped by this event will do
so in parallel with other activity. It is typically combined
with the starting(7) event by ser- vices when inserting
themselves as a dependency.</p>

<p>Job configuration files may use the export stanza to
export environment variables from their own environment into
the stopped event. See init(5) for more details.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE A service that wishes to be running whenever
another service would be running, started before and stopped
after it, might use:</p>

<p>start on starting apache stop on stopped apache</p>

<p>A task that must be run after another task or service
has been stopped might use:</p>

<p>start on stopped postgresql</p>
