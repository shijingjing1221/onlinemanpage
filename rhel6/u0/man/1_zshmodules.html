<p>ZSHMODULES(1) ZSHMODULES(1)</p>

<p>NAME zshmodules - zsh loadable modules</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Some optional parts of zsh are in modules,
separate from the core of the shell. Each of these modules
may be linked in to the shell at build time, or can be
dynamically linked while the shell is running if the
installation supports this feature. The modules that are
bundled with the zsh distribution are:</p>

<p>zsh/attr Builtins for manipulating extended attributes
(xattr).</p>

<p>zsh/cap Builtins for manipulating POSIX.1e (POSIX.6)
capability (privi- lege) sets.</p>

<p>zsh/clone A builtin that can clone a running shell onto
another terminal.</p>

<p>zsh/compctl The compctl builtin for controlling
completion.</p>

<p>zsh/complete The basic completion code.</p>

<p>zsh/complist Completion listing extensions.</p>

<p>zsh/computil A module with utility builtins needed for
the shell function based completion system.</p>

<p>zsh/curses curses windowing commands</p>

<p>zsh/datetime Some date/time commands and parameters.</p>

<p>zsh/zprof A module allowing profiling for shell
functions.</p>

<p>zsh/zpty A builtin for starting a command in a
pseudo-terminal.</p>

<p>zsh/zselect Block and return when file descriptors are
ready.</p>

<p>zsh/zutil Some utility builtins, e.g. the one for
supporting configuration via styles.</p>

<p>THE ZSH/ATTR MODULE The zsh/attr module is used for
manipulating extended attributes. The builtins in this
module are:</p>

<p>zgetattr filename attribute [ parameter ] Get the
extended attribute attribute from the specified file- name.
If the optional argument parameter is given, the attribute
is set on that parameter instead of being printed to
stdout.</p>

<p>zsetattr filename attribute value Set the extended
attribute attribute on the specified filename to value.</p>

<p>zdelattr filename attribute Remove the extended
attribute attribute from the specified file- name.</p>

<p>zlistattr filename [ parameter ] List the extended
attributes currently set on the specified filename. If the
optional argument parameter is given, the list of attributes
is set on that parameter instead of being printed to
stdout.</p>

<p>THE ZSH/CAP MODULE The zsh/cap module is used for
manipulating POSIX.1e (POSIX.6) capabil- ity sets. If the
operating system does not support this interface, the
builtins defined by this module will do nothing. The
builtins in this module are:</p>

<p>cap [ capabilities ] Change the shell s process
capability sets to the specified capabilities, otherwise
display the shell s current capabili- ties.</p>

<p>getcap filename ... This is a built-in implementation of
the POSIX standard utility. It displays the capability sets
on each specified filename.</p>

<p>setcap capabilities filename ... This is a built-in
implementation of the POSIX standard utility. It sets the
capability sets on each specified filename to the specified
capabilities.</p>

<p>THE ZSH/CLONE MODULE The zsh/clone module makes
available one builtin command:</p>

<p>clone tty Creates a forked instance of the current
shell, attached to the specified tty. In the new shell, the
PID, PPID and TTY special parameters are changed
appropriately. $! is set to zero in the new shell, and to
the new shell s PID in the original shell.</p>

<p>The return status of the builtin is zero in both shells
if suc- cessful, and non-zero on error.</p>

<p>The target of clone should be an unused terminal, such
as an unused virtual console or a virtual terminal created
by</p>

<p>xterm -e sh -c trap : INT QUIT TSTP; tty; while :; do
sleep 100000000; done</p>

<p>Some words of explanation are warranted about this long
xterm command line: when doing clone on a pseudo-terminal,
some other session (&quot;session&quot; meant as a unix
session group, or SID) is already owning the terminal. Hence
the cloned zsh cannot acquire the pseudo-terminal as a
controlling tty. That means two things:</p>

<p>the job control signals will go to the
sh-started-by-xterm pro- cess group (that s why we disable
INT QUIT and TSTP with trap; otherwise the while loop could
get suspended or killed)</p>

<p>the cloned shell will have job control disabled, and the
job control keys (control-C, control- and control-Z) will
not work.</p>

<p>This does not apply when cloning to an unused vc.</p>

<p>Cloning to an used (and unprepared) terminal will result
in two processes reading simultaneously from the same
terminal, with input bytes going randomly to either
process.</p>

<p>clone is mostly useful as a shell built-in replacement
for openvt.</p>

<p>THE ZSH/COMPCTL MODULE The zsh/compctl module makes
available two builtin commands. compctl, is the old,
deprecated way to control completions for ZLE. See
zshcompctl(1). The other builtin command, compcall can be
used in user-defined completion widgets, see
zshcompwid(1).</p>

<p>THE ZSH/COMPLETE MODULE The zsh/complete module makes
available several builtin commands which can be used in
user-defined completion widgets, see zshcompwid(1).</p>

<p>THE ZSH/COMPLIST MODULE The zsh/complist module offers
three extensions to completion listings: the ability to
highlight matches in such a list, the ability to scroll
through long lists and a different style of menu
completion.</p>

<p>Colored completion listings Whenever one of the
parameters ZLS_COLORS or ZLS_COLOURS is set and the
zsh/complist module is loaded or linked into the shell,
completion lists will be colored. Note, however, that
complist will not automati- cally be loaded if it is not
linked in: on systems with dynamic load- ing, zmodload
zsh/complist is required.</p>

<p>The parameters ZLS_COLORS and ZLS_COLOURS describe how
matches are highlighted. To turn on highlighting an empty
value suffices, in which case all the default values given
below will be used. The format of the value of these
parameters is the same as used by the GNU version of the ls
command: a colon-separated list of specifications of the
form name=value . The name may be one of the following
strings, most of which specify file types for which the
value will be used. The strings and their default values
are:</p>

<p>no 0 for normal text (i.e. when displaying something
other than a matched file)</p>

<p>fi 0 for regular files</p>

<p>di 32 for directories</p>

<p>ln 36 for symbolic links. If this has the special value
target, sym- bolic links are dereferenced and the target
file used to deter- mine the display format.</p>

<p>pi 31 for named pipes (FIFOs)</p>

<p>so 33 for sockets</p>

<p>bd 44;37 for block devices</p>

<p>cd 44;37 for character devices</p>

<p>or none for a symlink to nonexistent file (default is
the value defined for ln)</p>

<p>mi none for a non-existent file (default is the value
defined for fi); this code is currently not used</p>

<p>su 37;41 for files with setuid bit set</p>

<p>sg 30;43 for files with setgid bit set</p>

<p>tw 30;42 for world writable directories with sticky bit
set</p>

<p>ow 34;43 for world writable directories without sticky
bit set</p>

<p>st 37;44 for directories with sticky bit set but not
world writable</p>

<p>ex 35 for executable files</p>

<p>lce[ for the left code (see below)</p>

<p>rc m for the right code</p>

<p>tc 0 for the character indicating the file type printed
after file- names if the LIST_TYPES option is set</p>

<p>sp 0 for the spaces printed after matches to align the
next column</p>

<p>ec none for the end code</p>

<p>Apart from these strings, the name may also be an
asterisk (*) fol- lowed by any string. The value given for
such a string will be used for all files whose name ends
with the string. The name may also be an equals sign (=)
followed by a pattern; the EXTENDED_GLOB option will be
turned on for evaluation of the pattern. The value given for
this pattern will be used for all matches (not just
filenames) whose display string are matched by the pattern.
Definitions for the form with the leading equal sign take
precedence over the values defined for file types, which in
turn take precedence over the form with the leading asterisk
(file extensions).</p>

<p>The leading-equals form also allows different parts of
the displayed strings to be colored differently. For this,
the pattern has to use the (#b) globbing flag and pairs of
parentheses surrounding the parts of the strings that are to
be colored differently. In this case the value may consist
of more than one color code separated by equal signs. The
first code will be used for all parts for which no explicit
code is specified and the following codes will be used for
the parts matched by the sub-patterns in parentheses. For
example, the specification =(#b)(?)*(?)=0=3=7 will be used
for all matches which are at least two characters long and
will use the code 3 for the first character, 7 for the last
character and 0 for the rest.</p>

<p>All three forms of name may be preceded by a pattern in
parentheses. If this is given, the value will be used only
for matches in groups whose names are matched by the pattern
given in the parentheses. For example, (g*)m*=43 highlights
all matches beginning with m in groups whose names begin
with g using the color code 43. In case of the lc, rc, and
ec codes, the group pattern is ignored.</p>

<p>Note also that all patterns are tried in the order in
which they appear in the parameter value until the first one
matches which is then used.</p>

<p>When printing a match, the code prints the value of lc,
the value for the file-type or the last matching
specification with a *, the value of rc, the string to
display for the match itself, and then the value of ec if
that is defined or the values of lc, no, and rc if ec is not
defined.</p>

<p>The default values are ISO 6429 (ANSI) compliant and can
be used on vt100 compatible terminals such as xterms. On
monochrome terminals the default values will have no visible
effect. The colors function from the contribution can be
used to get associative arrays containing the codes for ANSI
terminals (see the section Other Functions in zshcon-
trib(1)). For example, after loading colors, one could use
$col- ors[red] to get the code for foreground color red and
$col- ors[bg-green] for the code for background color
green.</p>

<p>If the completion system invoked by compinit is used,
these parameters should not be set directly because the
system controls them itself. Instead, the list-colors style
should be used (see the section Comple- tion System
Configuration in zshcompsys(1)).</p>

<p>Scrolling in completion listings To enable scrolling
through a completion list, the LISTPROMPT parameter must be
set. Its value will be used as the prompt; if it is the
empty string, a default prompt will be used. The value may
contain escapes of the form %x. It supports the escapes %B,
%b, %S , %s, %U, %u, %F, %f, %K, %k and %{...%} used also in
shell prompts as well as three pairs of additional
sequences: a %l or %L is replaced by the number of the last
line shown and the total number of lines in the form
number/total ; a %m or %M is replaced with the number of the
last match shown and the total number of matches; and %p or
%P is replaced with Top, Bottom or the position of the first
line shown in percent of the total number of lines,
respectively. In each of these cases the form with the
uppercase letter will be replaced with a string of fixed
width, padded to the right with spaces, while the lowercase
form will not be padded.</p>

<p>If the parameter LISTPROMPT is set, the completion code
will not ask if the list should be shown. Instead it
immediately starts displaying the list, stopping after the
first screenful, showing the prompt at the bottom, waiting
for a keypress after temporarily switching to the listscroll
keymap. Some of the zle functions have a special meaning
while scrolling lists:</p>

<p>send-break stops listing discarding the key pressed</p>

<p>accept-line, down-history, down-line-or-history
down-line-or-search, vi-down-line-or-history scrolls forward
one line</p>

<p>complete-word, menu-complete, expand-or-complete
expand-or-complete-prefix, menu-complete-or-expand scrolls
forward one screenful</p>

<p>Every other character stops listing and immediately
processes the key as usual. Any key that is not bound in the
listscroll keymap or that is bound to undefined-key is
looked up in the keymap currently selected.</p>

<p>As for the ZLS_COLORS and ZLS_COLOURS parameters,
LISTPROMPT should not be set directly when using the shell
function based completion system. Instead, the list-prompt
style should be used.</p>

<p>Menu selection The zsh/complist module also offers an
alternative style of selecting matches from a list, called
menu selection, which can be used if the shell is set up to
return to the last prompt after showing a completion list
(see the ALWAYS_LAST_PROMPT option in zshoptions(1)).</p>

<p>Menu selection can be invoked directly by the widget
menu-select defined by this module. This is a standard ZLE
widget that can be bound to a key in the usual way as
described in zshzle(1).</p>

<p>Alternatively, the parameter MENUSELECT can be set to an
integer, which gives the minimum number of matches that must
be present before menu selection is automatically turned on.
This second method requires that menu completion be started,
either directly from a widget such as menu-complete, or due
to one of the options MENU_COMPLETE or AUTO_MENU being set.
If MENUSELECT is set, but is 0, 1 or empty, menu selection
will always be started during an ambiguous menu
completion.</p>

<p>When using the completion system based on shell
functions, the MENUSE- LECT parameter should not be used
(like the ZLS_COLORS and ZLS_COLOURS parameters described
above). Instead, the menu style should be used with the
select=... keyword.</p>

<p>After menu selection is started, the matches will be
listed. If there are more matches than fit on the screen,
only the first screenful is shown. The matches to insert
into the command line can be selected from this list. In the
list one match is highlighted using the value for ma from
the ZLS_COLORS or ZLS_COLOURS parameter. The default value
for this is 7 which forces the selected match to be
highlighted using standout mode on a vt100-compatible
terminal. If neither ZLS_COLORS nor ZLS_COLOURS is set, the
same terminal control sequence as for the %S escape in
prompts is used.</p>

<p>If there are more matches than fit on the screen and the
parameter MENUPROMPT is set, its value will be shown below
the matches. It sup- ports the same escape sequences as
LISTPROMPT, but the number of the match or line shown will
be that of the one where the mark is placed. If its value is
the empty string, a default prompt will be used.</p>

<p>The MENUSCROLL parameter can be used to specify how the
list is scrolled. If the parameter is unset, this is done
line by line, if it is set to 0 (zero), the list will scroll
half the number of lines of the screen. If the value is
positive, it gives the number of lines to scroll and if it
is negative, the list will be scrolled the number of lines
of the screen minus the (absolute) value.</p>

<p>As for the ZLS_COLORS, ZLS_COLOURS and LISTPROMPT
parameters, neither MENUPROMPT nor MENUSCROLL should be set
directly when using the shell function based completion
system. Instead, the select-prompt and select-scroll styles
should be used.</p>

<p>The completion code sometimes decides not to show all of
the matches in the list. These hidden matches are either
matches for which the com- pletion function which added them
explicitly requested that they not appear in the list (using
the -n option of the compadd builtin command) or they are
matches which duplicate a string already in the list
(because they differ only in things like prefixes or
suffixes that are not displayed). In the list used for menu
selection, however, even these matches are shown so that it
is possible to select them. To highlight such matches the hi
and du capabilities in the ZLS_COLORS and ZLS_COLOURS
parameters are supported for hidden matches of the first and
second kind, respectively.</p>

<p>Selecting matches is done by moving the mark around
using the zle move- ment functions. When not all matches can
be shown on the screen at the same time, the list will
scroll up and down when crossing the top or bottom line. The
following zle functions have special meaning during menu
selection:</p>

<p>accept-line accepts the current match and leaves menu
selection</p>

<p>send-break leaves menu selection and restores the
previous contents of the command line</p>

<p>redisplay, clear-screen execute their normal function
without leaving menu selection</p>

<p>accept-and-hold, accept-and-menu-complete accept the
currently inserted match and continue selection allowing to
select the next match to insert into the line</p>

<p>accept-and-infer-next-history accepts the current match
and then tries completion with menu selection again; in the
case of files this allows one to select a directory and
immediately attempt to complete files in it; if there are no
matches, a message is shown and one can use undo to go back
to completion on the previous level, every other key leaves
menu selection (including the other zle functions which are
otherwise special during menu selection)</p>

<p>undo removes matches inserted during the menu selection
by one of the three functions before</p>

<p>down-history, down-line-or-history
vi-down-line-or-history, down-line-or-search moves the mark
one line down</p>

<p>up-history, up-line-or-history vi-up-line-or-history,
up-line-or-search moves the mark one line up</p>

<p>forward-char, vi-forward-char moves the mark one column
right</p>

<p>backward-char, vi-backward-char moves the mark one
column left</p>

<p>forward-word, vi-forward-word vi-forward-word-end,
emacs-forward-word moves the mark one screenful down</p>

<p>backward-word, vi-backward-word, emacs-backward-word
moves the mark one screenful up</p>

<p>vi-forward-blank-word, vi-forward-blank-word-end moves
the mark to the first line of the next group of matches</p>

<p>vi-backward-blank-word moves the mark to the last line
of the previous group of matches</p>

<p>beginning-of-history moves the mark to the first
line</p>

<p>end-of-history moves the mark to the last line</p>

<p>beginning-of-buffer-or-history, beginning-of-line
beginning-of-line-hist, vi-beginning-of-line moves the mark
to the leftmost column</p>

<p>end-of-buffer-or-history, end-of-line end-of-line-hist,
vi-end-of-line moves the mark to the rightmost column</p>

<p>complete-word, menu-complete, expand-or-complete
expand-or-complete-prefix, menu-expand-or-complete moves the
mark to the next match</p>

<p>reverse-menu-complete moves the mark to the previous
match</p>

<p>vi-insert this toggles between normal and interactive
mode; in interactive mode the keys bound to self-insert and
self-insert-unmeta insert into the command line as in normal
editing mode but without leaving menu selection; after each
character completion is tried again and the list changes to
contain only the new matches; the completion widgets make
the longest unambiguous string be inserted in the command
line and undo and backward-delete-char go back to the
previous set of matches</p>

<p>history-incremental-search-forward,
history-incremental-search-backward this starts incremental
searches in the list of completions displayed; in this mode,
accept-line only leaves incremental search, going back to
the normal menu selection mode</p>

<p>All movement functions wrap around at the edges; any
other zle function not listed leaves menu selection and
executes that function. It is possible to make widgets in
the above list do the same by using the form of the widget
with a . in front. For example, the widget .accept-line has
the effect of leaving menu selection and accepting the
entire command line.</p>

<p>During this selection the widget uses the keymap
menuselect. Any key that is not defined in this keymap or
that is bound to undefined-key is looked up in the keymap
currently selected. This is used to ensure that the most
important keys used during selection (namely the cursor
keys, return, and TAB) have sensible defaults. However, keys
in the menuselect keymap can be modified directly using the
bindkey builtin command (see zshmodules(1)). For example, to
make the return key leave menu selection without accepting
the match currently selected one could call</p>

<p>bindkey -M menuselect^Msend-break</p>

<p>after loading the zsh/complist module.</p>

<p>THE ZSH/COMPUTIL MODULE The zsh/computil module adds
several builtin commands that are used by some of the
completion functions in the completion system based on shell
functions (see zshcompsys(1) ). Except for compquote these
builtin commands are very specialised and thus not very
interesting when writing your own completion functions. In
summary, these builtin commands are:</p>

<p>comparguments This is used by the _arguments function to
do the argument and command line parsing. Like compdescribe
it has an option -i to do the parsing and initialize some
internal state and various options to access the state
information to decide what should be completed.</p>

<p>compdescribe This is used by the _describe function to
build the displays for the matches and to get the strings to
add as matches with their options. On the first call one of
the options -i or -I should be supplied as the first
argument. In the first case, display strings without the
descriptions will be generated, in the sec- ond case, the
string used to separate the matches from their descriptions
must be given as the second argument and the descriptions
(if any) will be shown. All other arguments are like the
definition arguments to _describe itself.</p>

<p>Once compdescribe has been called with either the -i or
the -I option, it can be repeatedly called with the -g
option and the names of five arrays as its arguments. This
will step through the different sets of matches and store
the options in the first array, the strings with
descriptions in the second, the matches for these in the
third, the strings without descriptions in the fourth, and
the matches for them in the fifth array. These are then
directly given to compadd to register the matches with the
completion code.</p>

<p>compfiles Used by the _path_files function to optimize
complex recursive filename generation (globbing). It does
three things. With the -p and -P options it builds the glob
patterns to use, including the paths already handled and
trying to optimize the patterns with respect to the prefix
and suffix from the line and the match specification
currently used. The -i option does the directory tests for
the ignore-parents style and the -r option tests if a
component for some of the matches are equal to the string on
the line and removes all other matches if that is true.</p>

<p>compgroups Used by the _tags function to implement the
internals of the group-order style. This only takes its
arguments as names of completion groups and creates the
groups for it (all six types: sorted and unsorted, both
without removing duplicates, with removing all duplicates
and with removing consecutive dupli- cates).</p>

<p>compquote [ -p ] names ... There may be reasons to write
completion functions that have to add the matches using the
-Q option to compadd and perform quot- ing themselves.
Instead of interpreting the first character of the
all_quotes key of the compstate special association and
using the q flag for parameter expansions, one can use this
builtin command. The arguments are the names of scalar or
array parameters and the values of these parameters are
quoted as needed for the innermost quoting level. If the -p
option is given, quoting is done as if there is some prefix
before the values of the parameters, so that a leading equal
sign will not be quoted.</p>

<p>The return status is non-zero in case of an error and
zero oth- erwise.</p>

<p>comptags comptry These implement the internals of the
tags mechanism.</p>

<p>compvalues Like comparguments, but for the _values
function.</p>

<p>THE ZSH/CURSES MODULE The zsh/curses module makes
available one builtin command and various parameters.</p>

<p>Builtin zcurses init zcurses end zcurses addwin
targetwin nlines ncols begin_y begin_x [ parentwin ] zcurses
delwin targetwin zcurses refresh [ targetwin ... ] zcurses
touch targetwin ... zcurses move targetwin new_y new_x
zcurses clear targetwin [ redraw | eol | bot ] zcurses
position targetwin array zcurses char targetwin character
zcurses string targetwin string zcurses border targetwin
border zcurses attr targetwin [ {+/-}attribute |
fg_col/bg_col ] [...] zcurses bg targetwin [ {+/-}attribute
| fg_col/bg_col | @char ] [...] zcurses scroll targetwin [
on | off | {+/-}lines ] zcurses input targetwin [ param [
kparam [ mparam ] ] ] zcurses mouse [ delay num |
{+/-}motion ] zcurses timeout targetwin intval zcurses
querychar targetwin [ param ] Manipulate curses windows. All
uses of this command should be bracketed by zcurses init to
initialise use of curses, and zcurses end to end it;
omitting zcurses end can cause the terminal to be in an
unwanted state.</p>

<p>The subcommand addwin creates a window with nlines lines
and ncols columns. Its upper left corner will be placed at
row begin_y and column begin_x of the screen. targetwin is a
string and refers to the name of a window that is not
currently assigned. Note in particular the curses convention
that verti- cal values appear before horizontal values.</p>

<p>If addwin is given an existing window as the final
argument, the new window is created as a subwindow of
parentwin. This differs from an ordinary new window in that
the memory of the window contents is shared with the parent
s memory. Subwindows must be deleted before their parent.
Note that the coordinates of sub- windows are relative to
the screen, not the parent, as with other windows.</p>

<p>Use the subcommand delwin to delete a window created
with addwin. Note that end does not implicitly delete
windows, and that delwin does not erase the screen image of
the window.</p>

<p>The window corresponding to the full visible screen is
called stdscr; it always exists after zcurses init and
cannot be delete with delwin.</p>

<p>The subcommand refresh will refresh window targetwin;
this is necessary to make any pending changes (such as
characters you have prepared for output with char) visible
on the screen. refresh without an argument causes the screen
to be cleared and redrawn. If multiple windows are given,
the screen is updated once at the end.</p>

<p>The subcommand touch marks the targetwins listed as
changed. This is necessary before refreshing windows if a
window that was in front of another window (which may be
stdscr) is deleted.</p>

<p>The subcommand move moves the cursor position in
targetwin to new coordinates new_y and new_x. Note that the
subcommand string (but not the subcommand char) advances the
cursor posi- tion over the characters added.</p>

<p>The subcommand clear erases the contents of targetwin.
One (and no more than one) of three options may be
specified. With the option redraw, in addition the next
refresh of targetwin will cause the screen to be cleared and
repainted. With the option eol, targetwin is only cleared to
the end of the current cursor line. With the option bot,
targetwin is cleared to the end of the window, i.e
everything to the right and below the cursor is cleared.</p>

<p>The subcommand position writes various positions
associated with targetwin into the array named array. These
are, in order:</p>

<p>The y and x coordinates of the cursor relative to the
top left of targetwin</p>

<p>The y and x coordinates of the top left of targetwin on
the screen</p>

<p>The size of targetwin in y and x dimensions.</p>

<p>Outputting characters and strings are achieved by char
and string respectively.</p>

<p>To draw a border around window targetwin, use border.
Note that the border is not subsequently handled specially:
in other words, the border is simply a set of characters
output at the edge of the window. Hence it can be
overwritten, can scroll off the window, etc.</p>

<p>The subcommand attr will set targetwin s attributes or
fore- ground/background color pair for any successive
character out- put. Each attribute given on the line may be
prepended by a + to set or a - to unset that attribute; + is
assumed if absent. The attributes supported are blink, bold,
dim, reverse, stand- out, and underline.</p>

<p>Each fg_col/bg_col attribute (to be read as fg_col on
bg_col) sets the foreground and background color for
character output. The color default is sometimes available
(in particular if the library is ncurses), specifying the
foreground or background color with which the terminal
started. The color pair default/default is always
available.</p>

<p>bg overrides the color and other attributes of all
characters in the window. Its usual use is to set the
background initially, but it will overwrite the attributes
of any characters at the time when it is called. In addition
to the arguments allowed with attr, an argument @char
specifies a character to be shown in otherwise blank areas
of the window. Owing to limitations of curses this cannot be
a multibyte character (use of ASCII char- acters only is
recommended). As the specified set of attributes override
the existing background, turning attributes off in the
arguments is not useful, though this does not cause an
error.</p>

<p>The subcommand scroll can be used with on or off to
enabled or disable scrolling of a window when the cursor
would otherwise move below the window due to typing or
output. It can also be used with a positive or negative
integer to scroll the window up or down the given number of
lines without changing the current cursor position (which
therefore appears to move in the opposite direction relative
to the window). In the second case, if scrolling is off it
is temporarily turned on to allow the window to be
scrolled.</p>

<p>The subcommand input reads a single character from the
window without echoing it back. If param is supplied the
character is assigned to the parameter param, else it is
assigned to the parameter REPLY.</p>

<p>If both param and kparam are supplied, the key is read
in key- pad mode. In this mode special keys such as function
keys and arrow keys return the name of the key in the
parameter kparam. The key names are the macros defined in
the curses.h or ncurses.h with the prefix KEY_ removed; see
also the descrip- tion of the parameter zcurses_keycodes
below. Other keys cause a value to be set in param as
before. On a successful return only one of param or kparam
contains a non-empty string; the other is set to an empty
string.</p>

<p>If mparam is also supplied, input attempts to handle
mouse input. This is only available with the ncurses
library; mouse handling can be detected by checking for the
exit status of zcurses mouse with no arguments. If a mouse
button is clicked (or double- or triple-clicked, or pressed
or released with a configurable delay from being clicked)
then kparam is set to the string MOUSE, and mparam is set to
an array consisting of the following elements: - An
identifier to discriminate different input devices; this is
only rarely useful. - The x, y and z coordinates of the
mouse click relative to the full screen, as three elements
in that order (i.e. the y coordinate is, unusually, after
the x coordinate). The z coordinate is only available for a
few unusual input devices and is otherwise set to zero. -
Any events that occurred as separate items; usually there
will be just one. An event consists of PRESSED, RELEASED,
CLICKED, DOUBLE_CLICKED or TRIPLE_CLICKED fol- lowed
immediately (in the same element) by the number of the
button. - If the shift key was pressed, the string SHIFT. -
If the control key was pressed, the string CTRL. - If the
alt key was pressed, the string ALT.</p>

<p>Not all mouse events may be passed through to the
terminal win- dow; most terminal emulators handle some mouse
events them- selves. Note that the ncurses manual implies
that using input both with and without mouse handling may
cause the mouse cursor to appear and disappear.</p>

<p>The subcommand mouse can be used to configure the use of
the mouse. There is no window argument; mouse options are
global. zcurses mouse with no arguments returns status 0 if
mouse han- dling is possible, else status 1. Otherwise, the
possible argu- ments (which may be combined on the same
command line) are as follows. delay num sets the maximum
delay in milliseconds between press and release events to be
considered as a click; the value 0 disables click
resolution, and the default is one sixth of a second. motion
proceeded by an optional + (the default) or - turns on or
off reporting of mouse motion in addi- tion to clicks,
presses and releases, which are always reported. However, it
appears reports for mouse motion are not currently
implemented.</p>

<p>The subcommand timeout specifies a timeout value for
input from targetwin. If intval is negative, zcurses input
waits indefi- nitely for a character to be typed; this is
the default. If intval is zero, zcurses input returns
immediately; if there is typeahead it is returned, else no
input is done and status 1 is returned. If intval is
positive, zcurses input waits intval milliseconds for input
and if there is none at the end of that period returns
status 1.</p>

<p>The subcommand querychar queries the character at the
current cursor position. The return values are stored in the
array named param if supplied, else in the array reply. The
first value is the character (which may be a multibyte
character if the system supports them); the second is the
color pair in the usual fg_col/bg_col notation, or 0 if
color is not supported. Any attributes other than color that
apply to the character, as set with the subcommand attr,
appear as additional elements.</p>

<p>Parameters ZCURSES_COLORS Readonly integer. The maximum
number of colors the terminal supports. This value is
initialised by the curses library and is not available until
the first time zcurses init is run.</p>

<p>ZCURSES_COLOR_PAIRS Readonly integer. The maximum number
of color pairs fg_col/bg_col that may be defined in zcurses
attr commands; note this limit applies to all color pairs
that have been used whether or not they are currently
active. This value is ini- tialised by the curses library
and is not available until the first time zcurses init is
run.</p>

<p>zcurses_attrs Readonly array. The attributes supported
by zsh/curses; avail- able as soon as the module is
loaded.</p>

<p>zcurses_colors Readonly array. The colors supported by
zsh/curses; available as soon as the module is loaded.</p>

<p>zcurses_keycodes Readonly array. The values that may be
returned in the second parameter supplied to zcurses input
in the order in which they are defined internally by curses.
Not all function keys are listed, only F0; curses reserves
space for F0 up to F63.</p>

<p>zcurses_windows Readonly array. The current list of
windows, i.e. all windows that have been created with
zcurses addwin and not removed with zcurses delwin.</p>

<p>THE ZSH/DATETIME MODULE The zsh/datetime module makes
available one builtin command:</p>

<p>strftime [ -s scalar ] format epochtime strftime -r [ -q
] [ -s scalar ] format timestring Output the date denoted by
epochtime in the format specified.</p>

<p>With the option -r (reverse), use the format format to
parse the input string timestring and output the number of
seconds since the epoch at which the time occurred. If no
timezone is parsed, the current timezone is used; other
parameters are set to zero if not present. If timestring
does not match format the command returns status 1; it will
additionally print an error message unless the option -q
(quiet) is given. If timestring matches format but not all
characters in timestring were used, the con- version
succeeds; however, a warning is issued unless the option -q
is given. The matching is implemented by the system function
strptime; see strptime(3). This means that zsh format exten-
sions are not available, however for reverse lookup they are
not required. If the function is not implemented, the
command returns status 2 and (unless -q is given) prints a
message.</p>

<p>If -s scalar is given, assign the date string (or epoch
time in seconds if -r is given) to scalar instead of
printing it.</p>

<p>The zsh/datetime module makes available one
parameter:</p>

<p>EPOCHSECONDS An integer value representing the number of
seconds since the epoch.</p>

<p>THE ZSH/DELTOCHAR MODULE The zsh/deltochar module makes
available two ZLE functions:</p>

<p>delete-to-char Read a character from the keyboard, and
delete from the cursor position up to and including the next
(or, with repeat count n, the nth) instance of that
character. Negative repeat counts mean delete backwards.</p>

<p>zap-to-char This behaves like delete-to-char, except
that the final occur- rence of the character itself is not
deleted.</p>

<p>THE ZSH/EXAMPLE MODULE The zsh/example module makes
available one builtin command:</p>

<p>example [ -flags ] [ args ... ] Displays the flags and
arguments it is invoked with.</p>

<p>The purpose of the module is to serve as an example of
how to write a module.</p>

<p>THE ZSH/FILES MODULE The zsh/files module makes
available some common commands for file manipulation as
builtins; these commands are probably not needed for many
normal situations but can be useful in emergency recovery
situa- tions with constrained resources. The commands do not
implement all features now required by relevant standards
committees.</p>

<p>For all commands, a variant beginning zf_ is also
available and loaded automatically. Using the features
capability of zmodload will let you load only those names
you want.</p>

<p>The commands loaded by default are:</p>

<p>chgrp [ -hRs ] group filename ... Changes group of files
specified. This is equivalent to chown with a user-spec
argument of :group.</p>

<p>chown [ -hRs ] user-spec filename ... Changes ownership
and group of files specified.</p>

<p>The user-spec can be in four forms:</p>

<p>user change owner to user; do not change group user::
change owner to user; do not change group user: change owner
to user; change group to users primary group user:group
change owner to user; change group to group :group do not
change owner; change group to group</p>

<p>In each case, the : may instead be a .. The rule is that
if there is a : then the separator is :, otherwise if there
is a . then the separator is ., otherwise there is no
separa- tor.</p>

<p>Each of user and group may be either a username (or
group name, as appropriate) or a decimal user ID (group ID).
Interpretation as a name takes precedence, if there is an
all-numeric username (or group name).</p>

<p>If the target is a symbolic link, the -h option causes
chown to set the ownership of the link instead of its
target.</p>

<p>The -R option causes chown to recursively descend into
directo- ries, changing the ownership of all files in the
directory after changing the ownership of the directory
itself.</p>

<p>The -s option is a zsh extension to chown functionality.
It enables paranoid behaviour, intended to avoid security
problems involving a chown being tricked into affecting
files other than the ones intended. It will refuse to follow
symbolic links, so that (for example) chown luser
/tmp/foo/passwd can t acci- dentally chown /etc/passwd if
/tmp/foo happens to be a link to /etc. It will also check
where it is after leaving directories, so that a recursive
chown of a deep directory tree cant end up recursively
chowning /usr as a result of directories being moved up the
tree.</p>

<p>ln [ -dfhins ] filename dest ln [ -dfhins ] filename ...
dir Creates hard (or, with -s, symbolic) links. In the first
form, the specified destination is created, as a link to the
specified filename. In the second form, each of the
filenames is taken in turn, and linked to a pathname in the
specified directory that has the same last pathname
component.</p>

<p>Normally, ln will not attempt to create hard links to
directo- ries. This check can be overridden using the -d
option. Typi- cally only the super-user can actually succeed
in creating hard links to directories. This does not apply
to symbolic links in any case.</p>

<p>By default, existing files cannot be replaced by links.
The -i option causes the user to be queried about replacing
existing files. The -f option causes existing files to be
silently deleted, without querying. -f takes precedence.</p>

<p>The -h and -n options are identical and both exist for
compati- bility; either one indicates that if the target is
a symlink then it should not be dereferenced. Typically this
is used in combination with -sf so that if an existing link
points to a directory then it will be removed, instead of
followed. If this option is used with multiple filenames and
the target is a sym- bolic link pointing to a directory then
the result is an error.</p>

<p>mkdir [ -p ] [ -m mode ] dir ... Creates directories.
With the -p option, non-existing parent directories are
first created if necessary, and there will be no complaint
if the directory already exists. The -m option can be used
to specify (in octal) a set of file permissions for the
created directories, otherwise mode 777 modified by the
current umask (see umask(2)) is used.</p>

<p>mv [ -fi ] filename dest mv [ -fi ] filename ... dir
Moves files. In the first form, the specified filename is
moved to the specified destination. In the second form, each
of the filenames is taken in turn, and moved to a pathname
in the spec- ified directory that has the same last pathname
component.</p>

<p>By default, the user will be queried before replacing
any file that the user cannot write to, but writable files
will be silently removed. The -i option causes the user to
be queried about replacing any existing files. The -f option
causes any existing files to be silently deleted, without
querying. -f takes precedence.</p>

<p>Note that this mv will not move files across devices.
Histori- cal versions of mv, when actual renaming is
impossible, fall back on copying and removing files; if this
behaviour is desired, use cp and rm manually. This may
change in a future version.</p>

<p>rm [ -dfirs ] filename ... Removes files and directories
specified.</p>

<p>Normally, rm will not remove directories (except with
the -r option). The -d option causes rm to try removing
directories with unlink (see unlink(2)), the same method
used for files. Typically only the super-user can actually
succeed in unlinking directories in this way. -d takes
precedence over -r.</p>

<p>By default, the user will be queried before removing any
file that the user cannot write to, but writable files will
be silently removed. The -i option causes the user to be
queried about removing any files. The -f option causes files
to be silently deleted, without querying, and suppresses all
error indications. -f takes precedence.</p>

<p>The -r option causes rm to recursively descend into
directories, deleting all files in the directory before
removing the direc- tory with the rmdir system call (see
rmdir(2)).</p>

<p>The -s option is a zsh extension to rm functionality. It
enables paranoid behaviour, intended to avoid common
security problems involving a root-run rm being tricked into
removing files other than the ones intended. It will refuse
to follow symbolic links, so that (for example) rm
/tmp/foo/passwd can t accidentally remove /etc/passwd if
/tmp/foo happens to be a link to /etc. It will also check
where it is after leaving directories, so that a recursive
removal of a deep directory tree cant end up recursively
removing /usr as a result of directories being moved up the
tree.</p>

<p>rmdir dir ... Removes empty directories specified.</p>

<p>sync Calls the system call of the same name (see
sync(2)), which flushes dirty buffers to disk. It might
return before the I/O has actually been completed.</p>

<p>THE ZSH/MAPFILE MODULE The zsh/mapfile module provides
one special associative array parameter of the same
name.</p>

<p>mapfile This associative array takes as keys the names
of files; the resulting value is the content of the file.
The value is treated identically to any other text coming
from a parameter. The value may also be assigned to, in
which case the file in question is written (whether or not
it originally existed); or an element may be unset, which
will delete the file in question. For example, vared
mapfile[myfile] works as expected, editing the file
myfile.</p>

<p>When the array is accessed as a whole, the keys are the
names of files in the current directory, and the values are
empty (to save a huge overhead in memory). Thus
${(k)mapfile} has the same affect as the glob operator *(D),
since files beginning with a dot are not special. Care must
be taken with expressions such as rm ${(k)mapfile}, which
will delete every file in the current directory without the
usual rm * test.</p>

<p>The parameter mapfile may be made read-only; in that
case, files referenced may not be written or deleted.</p>

<p>A file may conveniently be read into an array as one
line per element with the form
array=(&quot;${(f)mapfile[filename]}&quot;). The double
quotes are necessary to prevent empty lines from being
removed.</p>

<p>Limitations Although reading and writing of the file in
question is efficiently handled, zsh s internal memory
management may be arbitrarily baroque; however, mapfile is
usually very much more efficient than anything involving a
loop. Note in particular that the whole contents of the file
will always reside physically in memory when accessed
(possibly multiple times, due to standard parameter
substitution operations). In particular, this means handling
of sufficiently long files (greater than the machines swap
space, or than the range of the pointer type) will be
incorrect.</p>

<p>No errors are printed or flagged for non-existent,
unreadable, or unwritable files, as the parameter mechanism
is too low in the shell execution hierarchy to make this
convenient.</p>

<p>It is unfortunate that the mechanism for loading modules
does not yet allow the user to specify the name of the shell
parameter to be given the special behaviour.</p>

<p>THE ZSH/MATHFUNC MODULE The zsh/mathfunc module provides
standard mathematical functions for use when evaluating
mathematical formulae. The syntax agrees with nor- mal C and
FORTRAN conventions, for example,</p>

<p>(( f = sin(0.3) ))</p>

<p>assigns the sine of 0.3 to the parameter f.</p>

<p>Most functions take floating point arguments and return
a floating point value. However, any necessary conversions
from or to integer type will be performed automatically by
the shell. Apart from atan with a second argument and the
abs, int and float functions, all func- tions behave as
noted in the manual page for the corresponding C func- tion,
except that any arguments out of range for the function in
ques- tion will be detected by the shell and an error
reported.</p>

<p>The following functions take a single floating point
argument: acos, acosh, asin, asinh, atan, atanh, cbrt, ceil,
cos, cosh, erf, erfc, exp, expm1, fabs, floor, gamma, j0,
j1, lgamma, log, log10, log1p, logb, sin, sinh, sqrt, tan,
tanh, y0, y1. The atan function can optionally take a second
argument, in which case it behaves like the C function
atan2. The ilogb function takes a single floating point
argument, but returns an integer.</p>

<p>The function signgam takes no arguments, and returns an
integer, which is the C variable of the same name, as
described in gamma(3). Note that it is therefore only useful
immediately after a call to gamma or lgamma. Note also that
signgam(RPAR and signgam are distinct expressions.</p>

<p>The following functions take two floating point
arguments: copysign, fmod, hypot, nextafter.</p>

<p>The following take an integer first argument and a
floating point sec- ond argument: jn, yn.</p>

<p>The following take a floating point first argument and
an integer sec- ond argument: ldexp, scalb.</p>

<p>The function abs does not convert the type of its single
argument; it returns the absolute value of either a floating
point number or an integer. The functions float and int
convert their arguments into a floating point or integer
value (by truncation) respectively.</p>

<p>Note that the C pow function is available in ordinary
math evaluation as the ** operator and is not provided
here.</p>

<p>The function rand48 is available if your system s
mathematical library has the function erand48(3). It returns
a pseudo-random floating point number between 0 and 1. It
takes a single string optional argument.</p>

<p>If the argument is not present, the random number seed
is initialised by three calls to the rand(3) function ---
this produces the same ran- dom numbers as the next three
values of $RANDOM.</p>

<p>If the argument is present, it gives the name of a
scalar parameter where the current random number seed will
be stored. On the first call, the value must contain at
least twelve hexadecimal digits (the remainder of the string
is ignored), or the seed will be initialised in the same
manner as for a call to rand48 with no argument. Subsequent
calls to rand48(param) will then maintain the seed in the
parameter param as a string of twelve hexadecimal digits,
with no base signifier. The random number sequences for
different parameters are completely independent, and are
also independent from that used by calls to rand48 with no
argument.</p>

<p>For example, consider</p>

<p>print $(( rand48(seed) )) print $(( rand48() )) print
$(( rand48(seed) ))</p>

<p>Assuming $seed does not exist, it will be initialised by
the first call. In the second call, the default seed is
initialised; note, how- ever, that because of the properties
of rand() there is a correlation between the seeds used for
the two initialisations, so for more secure uses, you should
generate your own 12-byte seed. The third call returns to
the same sequence of random numbers used in the first call,
unaffected by the intervening rand48().</p>

<p>THE ZSH/NEWUSER MODULE The zsh/newuser module is loaded
at boot if it is available, the RCS option is set, and the
PRIVILEGED option is not set (all three are true by
default). This takes place immediately after commands in the
global zshenv file (typically /etc/zshenv), if any, have
been executed. If the module is not available it is silently
ignored by the shell; the module may safely be removed from
$MODULE_PATH by the administrator if it is not required.</p>

<p>On loading, the module tests if any of the start-up
files .zshenv, .zprofile, .zshrc or .zlogin exist in the
directory given by the envi- ronment variable ZDOTDIR, or
the users home directory if that is not set. The test is not
performed and the module halts processing if the shell was
in an emulation mode (i.e. had been invoked as some other
shell than zsh).</p>

<p>If none of the start-up files were found, the module
then looks for the file newuser first in a sitewide
directory, usually the parent direc- tory of the
site-functions directory, and if that is not found the mod-
ule searches in a version-specific directory, usually the
parent of the functions directory containing
version-specific functions. (These directories can be
configured when zsh is built using the
--enable-site-scriptdir=dir and --enable-scriptdir=dir flags
to config- ure, respectively; the defaults are
prefix/share/zsh and pre- fix/share/zsh/$ZSH_VERSION where
the default prefix is /usr/local.)</p>

<p>If the file newuser is found, it is then sourced in the
same manner as a start-up file. The file is expected to
contain code to install start-up files for the user, however
any valid shell code will be exe- cuted.</p>

<p>The zsh/newuser module is then unconditionally
unloaded.</p>

<p>Note that it is possible to achieve exactly the same
effect as the zsh/newuser module by adding code to
/etc/zshenv. The module exists simply to allow the shell to
make arrangements for new users without the need for
intervention by package maintainers and system administra-
tors.</p>

<p>The script supplied with the module invokes the shell
function zsh-newuser-install. This may be invoked directly
by the user even if the zsh/newuser module is disabled.
Note, however, that if the module is not installed the
function will not be installed either. The func- tion is
documented in the section User Configuration Functions in
zsh- contrib(1).</p>

<p>THE ZSH/PARAMETER MODULE The zsh/parameter module gives
access to some of the internal hash tables used by the shell
by defining some special parameters.</p>

<p>options The keys for this associative array are the
names of the options that can be set and unset using the
setopt and unsetopt builtins. The value of each key is
either the string on if the option is currently set, or the
string off if the option is unset. Setting a key to one of
these strings is like setting or unsetting the option,
respectively. Unsetting a key in this array is like setting
it to the value off.</p>

<p>commands This array gives access to the command hash
table. The keys are the names of external commands, the
values are the pathnames of the files that would be executed
when the command would be invoked. Setting a key in this
array defines a new entry in this table in the same way as
with the hash builtin. Unsetting a key as in unset
&quot;commands[foo]&quot; removes the entry for the given
key from the command hash table.</p>

<p>functions This associative array maps names of enabled
functions to their definitions. Setting a key in it is like
defining a function with the name given by the key and the
body given by the value. Unsetting a key removes the
definition for the function named by the key.</p>

<p>dis_functions Like functions but for disabled
functions.</p>

<p>builtins This associative array gives information about
the builtin com- mands currently enabled. The keys are the
names of the builtin commands and the values are either
undefined for builtin com- mands that will automatically be
loaded from a module if invoked or defined for builtin
commands that are already loaded.</p>

<p>dis_builtins Like builtins but for disabled builtin
commands.</p>

<p>reswords This array contains the enabled reserved
words.</p>

<p>dis_reswords Like reswords but for disabled reserved
words.</p>

<p>aliases This maps the names of the regular aliases
currently enabled to their expansions.</p>

<p>dis_aliases Like aliases but for disabled regular
aliases.</p>

<p>galiases Like aliases, but for global aliases.</p>

<p>dis_galiases Like galiases but for disabled global
aliases.</p>

<p>saliases Like raliases, but for suffix aliases.</p>

<p>dis_saliases Like saliases but for disabled suffix
aliases.</p>

<p>parameters The keys in this associative array are the
names of the parame- ters currently defined. The values are
strings describing the type of the parameter, in the same
format used by the t parame- ter flag, see zshexpn(1) .
Setting or unsetting keys in this array is not possible.</p>

<p>modules An associative array giving information about
modules. The keys are the names of the modules loaded,
registered to be autoloaded, or aliased. The value says
which state the named module is in and is one of the strings
loaded, autoloaded, or alias:name, where name is the name
the module is aliased to.</p>

<p>Setting or unsetting keys in this array is not
possible.</p>

<p>dirstack A normal array holding the elements of the
directory stack. Note that the output of the dirs builtin
command includes one more directory, the current working
directory.</p>

<p>history This associative array maps history event
numbers to the full history lines.</p>

<p>historywords A special array containing the words stored
in the history.</p>

<p>jobdirs This associative array maps job numbers to the
directories from which the job was started (which may not be
the current direc- tory of the job).</p>

<p>The keys of the associative arrays are usually valid job
num- bers, and these are the values output with, for
example, ${(k)jobdirs}. Non-numeric job references may be
used when looking up a value; for example, ${jobdirs[%+]}
refers to the current job.</p>

<p>jobtexts This associative array maps job numbers to the
texts of the com- mand lines that were used to start the
jobs.</p>

<p>Handling of the keys of the associative array is as
described for jobdirs above.</p>

<p>jobstates This associative array gives information about
the states of the jobs currently known. The keys are the job
numbers and the val- ues are strings of the form
job-state:mark:pid=state.... The job-state gives the state
the whole job is currently in, one of running, suspended, or
done. The mark is + for the cur- rent job, - for the
previous job and empty otherwise. This is followed by one
pid=state for every process in the job. The pids are, of
course, the process IDs and the state describes the state of
that process.</p>

<p>Handling of the keys of the associative array is as
described for jobdirs above.</p>

<p>nameddirs This associative array maps the names of named
directories to the pathnames they stand for.</p>

<p>userdirs This associative array maps user names to the
pathnames of their home directories.</p>

<p>funcfiletrace This array contains the absolute line
numbers and corresponding file names for the point where the
current function, sourced file, or (if EVAL_LINENO is set)
eval command was called. The array is of the same length as
funcsourcetrace and functrace, but differs from
funcsourcetrace in that the line and file are the point of
call, not the point of definition, and differs from
functrace in that all values are absolute line numbers in
files, rather than relative to the start of a function, if
any.</p>

<p>funcsourcetrace This array contains the file names and
line numbers of the points where the functions, sourced
files, and (if EVAL_LINENO is set) eval commands currently
being executed were defined. The line number is the line
where the function name or name () started. In the case of
an autoloaded function the line number is reported as zero.
The format of each element is file- name:lineno. For
functions autoloaded from a file in native zsh format, where
only the body of the function occurs in the file, or for
files that have been executed by the source or . builtins,
the trace information is shown as filename:0, since the
entire file is the definition.</p>

<p>Most users will be interested in the information in the
func- filetrace array instead.</p>

<p>funcstack This array contains the names of the
functions, sourced files, and (if EVAL_LINENO is set) eval
commands. currently being exe- cuted. The first element is
the name of the function using the parameter.</p>

<p>functrace This array contains the names and line numbers
of the callers corresponding to the functions currently
being executed. The format of each element is name:lineno.
Callers are also shown for sourced files; the caller is the
point where the source or . command was executed.</p>

<p>THE ZSH/PCRE MODULE The zsh/pcre module makes some
commands available as builtins:</p>

<p>pcre_compile [ -aimxs ] PCRE Compiles a perl-compatible
regular expression.</p>

<p>Option -a will force the pattern to be anchored. Option
-i will compile a case-insensitive pattern. Option -m will
compile a multi-line pattern; that is, ^ and $ will match
newlines within the pattern. Option -x will compile an
extended pattern, wherein whitespace and # comments are
ignored. Option -s makes the dot metacharacter match all
characters, including those that indicate newline.</p>

<p>pcre_study Studies the previously-compiled PCRE which
may result in faster matching.</p>

<p>pcre_match [ -v var ] [ -a arr ] [ -n offset ] [ -b ]
string Returns successfully if string matches the
previously-compiled PCRE.</p>

<p>Upon successful match, if the expression captures
substrings within parentheses, pcre_match will set the array
$match to those substrings, unless the -a option is given,
in which case it will set the array arr. Similarly, the
variable MATCH will be set to the entire matched portion of
the string, unless the -v option is given, in which case the
variable var will be set. No variables are altered if there
is no successful match. A -n option starts searching for a
match from the byte offset posi- tion in string. If the -b
option is given, the variable ZPCRE_OP will be set to an
offset pair string, representing the byte offset positions
of the entire matched portion within the string. For
example, a ZPCRE_OP set to &quot;32 45&quot; indicates that
the matched portion began on byte offset 32 and ended on
byte offset 44. Here, byte offset position 45 is the
position directly after the matched portion. Keep in mind
that the byte position isn t necessarily the same as the
character position when UTF-8 characters are involved.
Consequently, the byte off- set positions are only to be
relied on in the context of using them for subsequent
searches on string, using an offset position as an argument
to the -n option. This is mostly used to imple- ment the
&quot;find all non-overlapping matches&quot;
functionality.</p>

<p>A simple example of &quot;find all non-overlapping
matches&quot;:</p>

<p>string=&quot;The following zip codes: 78884 90210
99513&quot; pcre_compile -m d{5}&quot; accum=() pcre_match
-b -- $string while [[ $? -eq 0 ]] do b=($=ZPCRE_OP)
accum+=$MATCH pcre_match -b -n $b[2] -- $string done print
-l $accum</p>

<p>The zsh/pcre module makes available the following test
condition: expr -pcre-match pcre Matches a string against a
perl-compatible regular expression.</p>

<p>For example,</p>

<p>[[ &quot;$text&quot; -pcre-match ^d+$ ]] &amp;&amp;
print text variable contains only &quot;ds&quot;.</p>

<p>THE ZSH/REGEX MODULE The zsh/regex module makes
available the following test condition: expr -regex-match
regex Matches a string against a POSIX extended regular
expression. On successful match, matched portion of the
string will normally be placed in the MATCH variable. If
there are any capturing parentheses within the regex, then
the match array variable will contain those. If the match is
not successful, then the vari- ables will not be
altered.</p>

<p>For example,</p>

<p>[[ alphabetical -regex-match ^a([^a]+)a([^a]+)a ]]
&amp;&amp; print -l $MATCH X $match</p>

<p>If the option REMATCH_PCRE is not set, then the =~
operator will automatically load this module as needed and
will invoke the -regex-match operator.</p>

<p>If BASH_REMATCH is set, then the array BASH_REMATCH will
be set instead of MATCH and match.</p>

<p>THE ZSH/SCHED MODULE The zsh/sched module makes
available one builtin command and one param- eter.</p>

<p>sched [-o] [+]hh:mm[:ss] command ... sched [-o]
[+]seconds command ... sched [ -item ] Make an entry in the
scheduled list of commands to execute. The time may be
specified in either absolute or relative time, and either as
hours, minutes and (optionally) seconds separated by a
colon, or seconds alone. An absolute number of seconds
indicates the time since the epoch (1970/01/01 00:00); this
is useful in combination with the features in the
zsh/datetime mod- ule, see the zsh/datetime module entry in
zshmodules(1).</p>

<p>With no arguments, prints the list of scheduled
commands. If the scheduled command has the -o flag set, this
is shown at the start of the command.</p>

<p>With the argument -item, removes the given item from the
list. The numbering of the list is continuous and entries
are in time order, so the numbering can change when entries
are added or deleted.</p>

<p>Commands are executed either immediately before a
prompt, or while the shells line editor is waiting for
input. In the lat- ter case it is useful to be able to
produce output that does not interfere with the line being
edited. Providing the option -o causes the shell to clear
the command line before the event and redraw it afterwards.
This should be used with any scheduled event that produces
visible output to the terminal; it is not needed, for
example, with output that updates a terminal emula- tors
title bar.</p>

<p>zsh_scheduled_events A readonly array corresponding to
the events scheduled by the sched builtin. The indices of
the array correspond to the num- bers shown when sched is
run with no arguments (provided that the KSH_ARRAYS option
is not set). The value of the array con- sists of the
scheduled time in seconds since the epoch (see the section
The zsh/datetime Module for facilities for using this
number), followed by a colon, followed by any options (which
may be empty but will be preceded by a - otherwise),
followed by a colon, followed by the command to be
executed.</p>

<p>The sched builtin should be used for manipulating the
events. Note that this will have an immediate effect on the
contents of the array, so that indices may become
invalid.</p>

<p>THE ZSH/NET/SOCKET MODULE The zsh/net/socket module
makes available one builtin command:</p>

<p>zsocket [ -altv ] [ -d fd ] [ args ] zsocket is
implemented as a builtin to allow full use of shell command
line editing, file I/O, and job control mechanisms.</p>

<p>Outbound Connections zsocket [ -v ] [ -d fd ] filename
Open a new Unix domain connection to filename. The shell
param- eter REPLY will be set to the file descriptor
associated with that connection. Currently, only stream
connections are sup- ported.</p>

<p>If -d is specified, its argument will be taken as the
target file descriptor for the connection.</p>

<p>In order to elicit more verbose output, use -v.</p>

<p>Inbound Connections zsocket -l [ -v ] [ -d fd ] filename
zsocket -l will open a socket listening on filename. The
shell parameter REPLY will be set to the file descriptor
associated with that listener.</p>

<p>If -d is specified, its argument will be taken as the
target file descriptor for the connection.</p>

<p>In order to elicit more verbose output, use -v.</p>

<p>zsocket -a [ -tv ] [ -d targetfd ] listenfd zsocket -a
will accept an incoming connection to the socket associated
with listenfd. The shell parameter REPLY will be set to the
file descriptor associated with the inbound connection.</p>

<p>If -d is specified, its argument will be taken as the
target file descriptor for the connection.</p>

<p>If -t is specified, zsocket will return if no incoming
connec- tion is pending. Otherwise it will wait for one.</p>

<p>In order to elicit more verbose output, use -v.</p>

<p>THE ZSH/STAT MODULE The zsh/stat module makes available
one builtin command under two pos- sible names:</p>

<p>zstat [ -gnNolLtTrs ] [ -f fd ] [ -H hash ] [ -A array ]
[ -F fmt ] [ +element ] [ file ... ] stat ... The command
acts as a front end to the stat system call (see stat(2)).
The same command is provided with two names; as the name
stat is often used by an external command it is recommended
that only the zstat form of the command is used. This can be
arranged by loading the module with the command zmodload -F
zsh/stat b:zstat.</p>

<p>If the stat call fails, the appropriate system error
message printed and status 1 is returned. The fields of
struct stat give information about the files provided as
arguments to the command. In addition to those available
from the stat call, an extra element link is provided. These
elements are:</p>

<p>device The number of the device on which the file
resides.</p>

<p>inode The unique number of the file on this device
(inode number).</p>

<p>mode The mode of the file; that is, the files type and
access permissions. With the -s option, this will be
returned as a string corresponding to the first column in
the dis- play of the ls -l command.</p>

<p>nlink The number of hard links to the file.</p>

<p>uid The user ID of the owner of the file. With the -s
option, this is displayed as a user name.</p>

<p>gid The group ID of the file. With the -s option, this
is displayed as a group name.</p>

<p>rdev The raw device number. This is only useful for
special devices.</p>

<p>size The size of the file in bytes.</p>

<p>atime mtime ctime The last access, modification and
inode change times of the file, respectively, as the number
of seconds since midnight GMT on 1st January, 1970. With the
-s option, these are printed as strings for the local time
zone; the format can be altered with the -F option, and with
the -g option the times are in GMT.</p>

<p>blksize The number of bytes in one allocation block on
the device on which the file resides.</p>

<p>block The number of disk blocks used by the file.</p>

<p>link If the file is a link and the -L option is in
effect, this contains the name of the file linked to,
otherwise it is empty. Note that if this element is selected
( zstat +link ) then the -L option is automatically
used.</p>

<p>A particular element may be selected by including its
name pre- ceded by a + in the option list; only one element
is allowed. The element may be shortened to any unique set
of leading char- acters. Otherwise, all elements will be
shown for all files.</p>

<p>Options:</p>

<p>-A array Instead of displaying the results on standard
output, assign them to an array, one struct stat element per
array element for each file in order. In this case nei- ther
the name of the element nor the name of the files appears in
array unless the -t or -n options were given, respectively.
If -t is given, the element name appears as a prefix to the
appropriate array element; if -n is given, the file name
appears as a separate array element preceding all the
others. Other formatting options are respected.</p>

<p>-H hash Similar to -A, but instead assign the values to
hash. The keys are the elements listed above. If the -n
option is provided then the name of the file is included in
the hash with key name.</p>

<p>-f fd Use the file on file descriptor fd instead of
named files; no list of file names is allowed in this
case.</p>

<p>-F fmt Supplies a strftime (see strftime(3)) string for
the for- matting of the time elements. The -s option is
implied.</p>

<p>-g Show the time elements in the GMT time zone. The -s
option is implied.</p>

<p>-l List the names of the type elements (to standard
output or an array as appropriate) and return immediately;
options other than -A and arguments are ignored.</p>

<p>-L Perform an lstat (see lstat(2)) rather than a stat
system call. In this case, if the file is a link,
information about the link itself rather than the target
file is returned. This option is required to make the link
ele- ment useful. Its important to note that this is the
exact opposite from ls(1), etc.</p>

<p>-n Always show the names of files. Usually these are
only shown when output is to standard output and there is
more than one file in the list.</p>

<p>-N Never show the names of files.</p>

<p>-o If a raw file mode is printed, show it in octal,
which is more useful for human consumption than the default
of decimal. A leading zero will be printed in this case.
Note that this does not affect whether a raw or formatted
file mode is shown, which is controlled by the -r and -s
options, nor whether a mode is shown at all.</p>

<p>-r Print raw data (the default format) alongside string
data (the -s format); the string data appears in parentheses
after the raw data.</p>

<p>-s Print mode, uid, gid and the three time elements as
strings instead of numbers. In each case the format is like
that of ls -l.</p>

<p>-t Always show the type names for the elements of struct
stat. Usually these are only shown when output is to
standard output and no individual element has been
selected.</p>

<p>-T Never show the type names of the struct stat
elements.</p>

<p>THE ZSH/SYSTEM MODULE The zsh/system module makes
available three builtin commands and two parameters.</p>

<p>Builtins syserror [ -e errvar ] [ -p prefix ] [ errno |
errname ] This command prints out the error message
associated with errno, a system error number, followed by a
newline to standard error.</p>

<p>Instead of the error number, a name errname, for example
ENOENT, may be used. The set of names is the same as the
contents of the array errnos, see below.</p>

<p>If the string prefix is given, it is printed in front of
the error message, with no intervening space.</p>

<p>If errvar is supplied, the entire message, without a
newline, is assigned to the parameter names errvar and
nothing is output.</p>

<p>A return status of 0 indicates the message was
successfully printed (although it may not be useful if the
error number was out of the systems range), a return status
of 1 indicates an error in the parameters, and a return
status of 2 indicates the error name was not recognised (no
message is printed for this).</p>

<p>sysread [ -c countvar ] [ -i infd ] [ -o outfd ] [ -s
bufsize ] [ -t timeout ] [ param ] Perform a single system
read from file descriptor infd, or zero if that is not
given. The result of the read is stored in param or REPLY if
that is not given. If countvar is given, the number of bytes
read is assigned to the parameter named by countvar.</p>

<p>The maximum number of bytes read is bufsize or 8192 if
that is not given, however the command returns as soon as
any number of bytes was successfully read.</p>

<p>If timeout is given, it specifies a timeout in seconds,
which may be zero to poll the file descriptor. This is
handled by the poll system call if available, otherwise the
select system call if available.</p>

<p>If outfd is given, an attempt is made to write all the
bytes just read to the file descriptor outfd. If this fails,
because of a system error other than EINTR or because of an
internal zsh error during an interrupt, the bytes read but
not written are stored in the parameter named by param if
supplied (no default is used in this case), and the number
of bytes read but not written is stored in the parameter
named by countvar if that is supplied. If it was successful,
countvar contains the full num- ber of bytes transferred, as
usual, and param is not set.</p>

<p>The error EINTR (interrupted system call) is handled
internally so that shell interrupts are transparent to the
caller. Any other error causes a return.</p>

<p>The possible return statuses are 0 At least one byte of
data was successfully read and, if appropriate, written.</p>

<p>1 There was an error in the parameters to the command.
This is the only error for which a message is printed to
standard error.</p>

<p>2 There was an error on the read, or on polling the
input file descriptor for a timeout. The parameter ERRNO
gives the error.</p>

<p>3 Data were successfully read, but there was an error
writ- ing them to outfd. The parameter ERRNO gives the
error.</p>

<p>4 The attempt to read timed out. Note this does not set
ERRNO as this is not a system error.</p>

<p>5 No system error occurred, but zero bytes were read.
This usually indicates end of file. The parameters are set
according to the usual rules; no write to outfd is
attempted.</p>

<p>syswrite [ -c countvar ] [ -o outfd ] data The data (a
single string of bytes) are written to the file descriptor
outfd, or 1 if that is not given, using the write system
call. Multiple write operations may be used if the first
does not write all the data.</p>

<p>If countvar is given, the number of byte written is
stored in the parameter named by countvar; this may not be
the full length of data if an error occurred.</p>

<p>The error EINTR (interrupted system call) is handled
internally by retrying; otherwise an error causes the
command to return. For example, if the file descriptor is
set to non-blocking out- put, an error EAGAIN (on some
systems, EWOULDBLOCK) may result in the command returning
early.</p>

<p>The return status may be 0 for success, 1 for an error
in the parameters to the command, or 2 for an error on the
write; no error message is printed in the last case, but the
parameter ERRNO will reflect the error that occurred.</p>

<p>Parameters errnos A readonly array of the names of
errors defined on the system. These are typically macros
defined in C by including the system header file errno.h.
The index of each name (assuming the option KSH_ARRAYS is
unset) corresponds to the error number. Error numbers num
before the last known error which have no name are given the
name Enum in the array.</p>

<p>Note that aliases for errors are not handled; only the
canonical name is used.</p>

<p>sysparams A readonly associative array. The keys are:
pid Returns the process ID of the current process, even in
sub- shells. Compare $$, which returns the process ID of the
main shell process.</p>

<p>ppid Returns the process ID of the parent of the current
process, even in subshells. Compare $PPID, which returns the
process ID of the parent of the main shell process.</p>

<p>THE ZSH/NET/TCP MODULE The zsh/net/tcp module makes
available one builtin command:</p>

<p>ztcp [ -acflLtv ] [ -d fd ] [ args ] ztcp is implemented
as a builtin to allow full use of shell com- mand line
editing, file I/O, and job control mechanisms.</p>

<p>If ztcp is run with no options, it will output the
contents of its session table.</p>

<p>If it is run with only the option -L, it will output the
con- tents of the session table in a format suitable for
automatic parsing. The option is ignored if given with a
command to open or close a session. The output consists of a
set of lines, one per session, each containing the following
elements separated by spaces:</p>

<p>File descriptor The file descriptor in use for the
connection. For nor- mal inbound (I) and outbound (O)
connections this may be read and written by the usual shell
mechanisms. However, it should only be close with ztcp
-c.</p>

<p>Connection type A letter indicating how the session was
created:</p>

<p>Z A session created with the zftp command.</p>

<p>L A connection opened for listening with ztcp -l.</p>

<p>I An inbound connection accepted with ztcp -a.</p>

<p>O An outbound connection created with ztcp host ....</p>

<p>The local host This is usually set to an all-zero IP
address as the address of the localhost is irrelevant.</p>

<p>The local port This is likely to be zero unless the
connection is for listening.</p>

<p>The remote host This is the fully qualified domain name
of the peer, if available, else an IP address. It is an
all-zero IP address for a session opened for listening.</p>

<p>The remote port This is zero for a connection opened for
listening.</p>

<p>Outbound Connections ztcp [ -v ] [ -d fd ] host [ port ]
Open a new TCP connection to host. If the port is omitted,
it will default to port 23. The connection will be added to
the session table and the shell parameter REPLY will be set
to the file descriptor associated with that connection.</p>

<p>If -d is specified, its argument will be taken as the
target file descriptor for the connection.</p>

<p>In order to elicit more verbose output, use -v.</p>

<p>Inbound Connections ztcp -l [ -v ] [ -d fd ] port ztcp
-l will open a socket listening on TCP port. The socket will
be added to the session table and the shell parameter REPLY
will be set to the file descriptor associated with that lis-
tener.</p>

<p>If -d is specified, its argument will be taken as the
target file descriptor for the connection.</p>

<p>In order to elicit more verbose output, use -v.</p>

<p>ztcp -a [ -tv ] [ -d targetfd ] listenfd ztcp -a will
accept an incoming connection to the port associ- ated with
listenfd. The connection will be added to the session table
and the shell parameter REPLY will be set to the file
descriptor associated with the inbound connection.</p>

<p>If -d is specified, its argument will be taken as the
target file descriptor for the connection.</p>

<p>If -t is specified, ztcp will return if no incoming
connection is pending. Otherwise it will wait for one.</p>

<p>In order to elicit more verbose output, use -v.</p>

<p>Closing Connections ztcp -cf [ -v ] [ fd ] ztcp -c [ -v
] [ fd ] ztcp -c will close the socket associated with fd.
The socket will be removed from the session table. If fd is
not specified, ztcp will close everything in the session
table.</p>

<p>Normally, sockets registered by zftp (see zshmodules(1)
) cannot be closed this way. In order to force such a socket
closed, use -f.</p>

<p>In order to elicit more verbose output, use -v.</p>

<p>Example Here is how to create a TCP connection between
two instances of zsh. We need to pick an unassigned port;
here we use the randomly chosen 5123.</p>

<p>On host1, zmodload zsh/net/tcp ztcp -l 5123
listenfd=$REPLY ztcp -a $listenfd fd=$REPLY The second from
last command blocks until there is an incoming connec-
tion.</p>

<p>Now create a connection from host2 (which may, of
course, be the same machine): zmodload zsh/net/tcp ztcp
host1 5123 fd=$REPLY</p>

<p>Now on each host, $fd contains a file descriptor for
talking to the other. For example, on host1: print This is a
message &gt;&amp;$fd and on host2: read -r line
&lt;&amp;$fd; print -r - $line prints This is a message.</p>

<p>To tidy up, on host1: ztcp -c $listenfd ztcp -c $fd and
on host2 ztcp -c $fd</p>

<p>THE ZSH/TERMCAP MODULE The zsh/termcap module makes
available one builtin command:</p>

<p>echotc cap [ arg ... ] Output the termcap value
corresponding to the capability cap, with optional
arguments.</p>

<p>The zsh/termcap module makes available one
parameter:</p>

<p>termcap An associative array that maps termcap
capability codes to their values.</p>

<p>THE ZSH/TERMINFO MODULE The zsh/terminfo module makes
available one builtin command:</p>

<p>echoti cap [ arg ] Output the terminfo value
corresponding to the capability cap, instantiated with arg
if applicable.</p>

<p>The zsh/terminfo module makes available one
parameter:</p>

<p>terminfo An associative array that maps terminfo
capability names to their values.</p>

<p>THE ZSH/ZFTP MODULE The zsh/zftp module makes available
one builtin command:</p>

<p>zftp subcommand [ args ] The zsh/zftp module is a client
for FTP (file transfer proto- col). It is implemented as a
builtin to allow full use of shell command line editing,
file I/O, and job control mechanisms. Often, users will
access it via shell functions providing a more powerful
interface; a set is provided with the zsh distribution and
is described in zshzftpsys(1). However, the zftp command is
entirely usable in its own right.</p>

<p>All commands consist of the command name zftp followed
by the name of a subcommand. These are listed below. The
return sta- tus of each subcommand is supposed to reflect
the success or failure of the remote operation. See a
description of the vari- able ZFTP_VERBOSE for more
information on how responses from the server may be
printed.</p>

<p>Subcommands open host[:port] [ user [ password [ account
] ] ] Open a new FTP session to host, which may be the name
of a TCP/IP connected host or an IP number in the standard
dot nota- tion. If the argument is in the form host:port,
open a connec- tion to TCP port port instead of the standard
FTP port 21. This may be the name of a TCP service or a
number: see the descrip- tion of ZFTP_PORT below for more
information.</p>

<p>If IPv6 addresses in colon format are used, the host
should be surrounded by quoted square brackets to
distinguish it from the port, for example
[fe80::203:baff:fe02:8b56. For consistency this is allowed
with all forms of host.</p>

<p>Remaining arguments are passed to the login subcommand.
Note that if no arguments beyond host are supplied, open
will not automatically call login. If no arguments at all
are supplied, open will use the parameters set by the params
subcommand.</p>

<p>After a successful open, the shell variables ZFTP_HOST,
ZFTP_PORT, ZFTP_IP and ZFTP_SYSTEM are available; see Vari-
ables below.</p>

<p>login [ name [ password [ account ] ] ] user [ name [
password [ account ] ] ] Login the user name with parameters
password and account. Any of the parameters can be omitted,
and will be read from standard input if needed (name is
always needed). If standard input is a terminal, a prompt
for each one will be printed on standard error and password
will not be echoed. If any of the parameters are not used, a
warning message is printed.</p>

<p>After a successful login, the shell variables ZFTP_USER,
ZFTP_ACCOUNT and ZFTP_PWD are available; see Variables
below.</p>

<p>This command may be re-issued when a user is already
logged in, and the server will first be reinitialized for a
new user.</p>

<p>params [ host [ user [ password [ account ] ] ] ] params
- Store the given parameters for a later open command with
no arguments. Only those given on the command line will be
remem- bered. If no arguments are given, the parameters
currently set are printed, although the password will appear
as a line of stars; the return status is one if no
parameters were set, zero otherwise.</p>

<p>Any of the parameters may be specified as a ? , which
may need to be quoted to protect it from shell expansion. In
this case, the appropriate parameter will be read from stdin
as with the login subcommand, including special handling of
password. If the ? is followed by a string, that is used as
the prompt for reading the parameter instead of the default
message (any neces- sary punctuation and whitespace should
be included at the end of the prompt). The first letter of
the parameter (only) may be quoted with a ; hence an
argument $word&quot; guarantees that the string from the
shell parameter $word will be treated liter- ally, whether
or not it begins with a ?.</p>

<p>If instead a single - is given, the existing parameters,
if any, are deleted. In that case, calling open with no
arguments will cause an error.</p>

<p>The list of parameters is not deleted after a close,
however it will be deleted if the zsh/zftp module is
unloaded.</p>

<p>For example,</p>

<p>zftp params ftp.elsewhere.xx juser ?Password for
juser:</p>

<p>will store the host ftp.elsewhere.xx and the user juser
and then prompt the user for the corresponding password with
the given prompt.</p>

<p>test Test the connection; if the server has reported
that it has closed the connection (maybe due to a timeout),
return status 2; if no connection was open anyway, return
status 1; else return status 0. The test subcommand is
silent, apart from messages printed by the $ZFTP_VERBOSE
mechanism, or error messages if the connection closes. There
is no network overhead for this test.</p>

<p>The test is only supported on systems with either the
select(2) or poll(2) system calls; otherwise the message not
supported on this system is printed instead.</p>

<p>The test subcommand will automatically be called at the
start of any other subcommand for the current session when a
connection is open.</p>

<p>cd directory Change the remote directory to directory.
Also alters the shell variable ZFTP_PWD.</p>

<p>cdup Change the remote directory to the one higher in
the directory tree. Note that cd .. will also work correctly
on non-UNIX sys- tems.</p>

<p>dir [ args... ] Give a (verbose) listing of the remote
directory. The args are passed directly to the server. The
command s behaviour is imple- mentation dependent, but a
UNIX server will typically interpret args as arguments to
the ls command and with no arguments return the result of ls
-l. The directory is listed to standard out- put.</p>

<p>ls [ args ] Give a (short) listing of the remote
directory. With no args, produces a raw list of the files in
the directory, one per line. Otherwise, up to vagaries of
the server implementation, behaves similar to dir.</p>

<p>type [ type ] Change the type for the transfer to type,
or print the current type if type is absent. The allowed
values are A (ASCII), I (Image, i.e. binary), or B (a
synonym for I).</p>

<p>The FTP default for a transfer is ASCII. However, if
zftp finds that the remote host is a UNIX machine with 8-bit
byes, it will automatically switch to using binary for file
transfers upon open. This can subsequently be
overridden.</p>

<p>The transfer type is only passed to the remote host when
a data connection is established; this command involves no
network overhead.</p>

<p>ascii The same as type A.</p>

<p>binary The same as type I.</p>

<p>mode [ S | B ] Set the mode type to stream (S) or block
(B). Stream mode is the default; block mode is not widely
supported.</p>

<p>remote files... local [ files... ] Print the size and
last modification time of the remote or local files. If
there is more than one item on the list, the name of the
file is printed first. The first number is the file size,
the second is the last modification time of the file in the
for- mat CCYYMMDDhhmmSS consisting of year, month, date,
hour, min- utes and seconds in GMT. Note that this format,
including the length, is guaranteed, so that time strings
can be directly com- pared via the [[ builtins &lt; and &gt;
operators, even if they are too long to be represented as
integers.</p>

<p>Not all servers support the commands for retrieving this
infor- mation. In that case, the remote command will print
nothing and return status 2, compared with status 1 for a
file not found.</p>

<p>The local command (but not remote) may be used with no
argu- ments, in which case the information comes from
examining file descriptor zero. This is the same file as
seen by a put command with no further redirection.</p>

<p>get file [...] Retrieve all files from the server,
concatenating them and send- ing them to standard
output.</p>

<p>put file [...] For each file, read a file from standard
input and send that to the remote host with the given
name.</p>

<p>append file [...] As put, but if the remote file already
exists, data is appended to it instead of overwriting
it.</p>

<p>getat file point putat file point appendat file point
Versions of get, put and append which will start the
transfer at the given point in the remote file. This is
useful for append- ing to an incomplete local file. However,
note that this abil- ity is not universally supported by
servers (and is not quite the behaviour specified by the
standard).</p>

<p>delete file [...] Delete the list of files on the
server.</p>

<p>mkdir directory Create a new directory directory on the
server.</p>

<p>rmdir directory Delete the directory directory on the
server.</p>

<p>rename old-name new-name Rename file old-name to
new-name on the server.</p>

<p>site args... Send a host-specific command to the server.
You will probably only need this if instructed by the server
to use it.</p>

<p>quote args... Send the raw FTP command sequence to the
server. You should be familiar with the FTP command set as
defined in RFC959 before doing this. Useful commands may
include STAT and HELP. Note also the mechanism for returning
messages as described for the variable ZFTP_VERBOSE below,
in particular that all messages from the control connection
are sent to standard error.</p>

<p>close quit Close the current data connection. This
unsets the shell param- eters ZFTP_HOST, ZFTP_PORT, ZFTP_IP,
ZFTP_SYSTEM, ZFTP_USER, ZFTP_ACCOUNT, ZFTP_PWD, ZFTP_TYPE
and ZFTP_MODE.</p>

<p>session [ sessname ] Allows multiple FTP sessions to be
used at once. The name of the session is an arbitrary string
of characters; the default session is called default. If
this command is called without an argument, it will list all
the current sessions; with an argument, it will either
switch to the existing session called sessname, or create a
new session of that name.</p>

<p>Each session remembers the status of the connection, the
set of connection-specific shell parameters (the same set as
are unset when a connection closes, as given in the
description of close), and any user parameters specified
with the params subcommand. Changing to a previous session
restores those values; changing to a new session initialises
them in the same way as if zftp had just been loaded. The
name of the current session is given by the parameter
ZFTP_SESSION.</p>

<p>rmsession [ sessname ] Delete a session; if a name is
not given, the current session is deleted. If the current
session is deleted, the earliest exist- ing session becomes
the new current session, otherwise the cur- rent session is
not changed. If the session being deleted is the only one, a
new session called default is created and becomes the
current session; note that this is a new session even if the
session being deleted is also called default. It is
recommended that sessions not be deleted while background
commands which use zftp are still active.</p>

<p>Parameters The following shell parameters are used by
zftp. Currently none of them are special.</p>

<p>ZFTP_TMOUT Integer. The time in seconds to wait for a
network operation to complete before returning an error. If
this is not set when the module is loaded, it will be given
the default value 60. A value of zero turns off timeouts. If
a timeout occurs on the control connection it will be
closed. Use a larger value if this occurs too
frequently.</p>

<p>ZFTP_IP Readonly. The IP address of the current
connection in dot nota- tion.</p>

<p>ZFTP_HOST Readonly. The hostname of the current remote
server. If the host was opened as an IP number, ZFTP_HOST
contains that instead; this saves the overhead for a name
lookup, as IP num- bers are most commonly used when a
nameserver is unavailable.</p>

<p>ZFTP_PORT Readonly. The number of the remote TCP port to
which the con- nection is open (even if the port was
originally specified as a named service). Usually this is
the standard FTP port, 21.</p>

<p>In the unlikely event that your system does not have the
appro- priate conversion functions, this appears in network
byte order. If your system is little-endian, the port then
consists of two swapped bytes and the standard port will be
reported as 5376. In that case, numeric ports passed to zftp
open will also need to be in this format.</p>

<p>ZFTP_SYSTEM Readonly. The system type string returned by
the server in response to an FTP SYST request. The most
interesting case is a string beginning &quot;UNIX Type:
L8&quot;, which ensures maximum compati- bility with a local
UNIX host.</p>

<p>ZFTP_TYPE Readonly. The type to be used for data
transfers , either A or I. Use the type subcommand to change
this.</p>

<p>ZFTP_USER Readonly. The username currently logged in, if
any.</p>

<p>ZFTP_ACCOUNT Readonly. The account name of the current
user, if any. Most servers do not require an account
name.</p>

<p>ZFTP_PWD Readonly. The current directory on the
server.</p>

<p>ZFTP_CODE Readonly. The three digit code of the last FTP
reply from the server as a string. This can still be read
after the connection is closed, and is not changed when the
current session changes.</p>

<p>ZFTP_REPLY Readonly. The last line of the last reply
sent by the server. This can still be read after the
connection is closed, and is not changed when the current
session changes.</p>

<p>ZFTP_SESSION Readonly. The name of the current FTP
session; see the descrip- tion of the session
subcommand.</p>

<p>ZFTP_PREFS A string of preferences for altering aspects
of zftps behaviour. Each preference is a single character.
The follow- ing are defined:</p>

<p>P Passive: attempt to make the remote server initiate
data transfers. This is slightly more efficient than
sendport mode. If the letter S occurs later in the string,
zftp will use sendport mode if passive mode is not
available.</p>

<p>S Sendport: initiate transfers by the FTP PORT command.
If this occurs before any P in the string, passive mode will
never be attempted.</p>

<p>D Dumb: use only the bare minimum of FTP commands. This
prevents the variables ZFTP_SYSTEM and ZFTP_PWD from being
set, and will mean all connections default to ASCII type. It
may prevent ZFTP_SIZE from being set during a transfer if
the server does not send it anyway (many servers do).</p>

<p>If ZFTP_PREFS is not set when zftp is loaded, it will be
set to a default of PS , i.e. use passive mode if available,
otherwise fall back to sendport mode.</p>

<p>ZFTP_VERBOSE A string of digits between 0 and 5
inclusive, specifying which responses from the server should
be printed. All responses go to standard error. If any of
the numbers 1 to 5 appear in the string, raw responses from
the server with reply codes beginning with that digit will
be printed to standard error. The first digit of the three
digit reply code is defined by RFC959 to cor- respond
to:</p>

<p>1. A positive preliminary reply.</p>

<p>2. A positive completion reply.</p>

<p>3. A positive intermediate reply.</p>

<p>4. A transient negative completion reply.</p>

<p>5. A permanent negative completion reply.</p>

<p>It should be noted that, for unknown reasons, the reply
Service not available, which forces termination of a
connection, is classified as 421, i.e. transient negative,
an interesting interpretation of the word transient.</p>

<p>The code 0 is special: it indicates that all but the
last line of multiline replies read from the server will be
printed to standard error in a processed format. By
convention, servers use this mechanism for sending
information for the user to read. The appropriate reply
code, if it matches the same response, takes priority.</p>

<p>If ZFTP_VERBOSE is not set when zftp is loaded, it will
be set to the default value 450, i.e., messages destined for
the user and all errors will be printed. A null string is
valid and specifies that no messages should be printed.</p>

<p>Functions zftp_chpwd If this function is set by the
user, it is called every time the directory changes on the
server, including when a user is logged in, or when a
connection is closed. In the last case, $ZFTP_PWD will be
unset; otherwise it will reflect the new directory.</p>

<p>zftp_progress If this function is set by the user, it
will be called during a get, put or append operation each
time sufficient data has been received from the host. During
a get, the data is sent to stan- dard output, so it is vital
that this function should write to standard error or
directly to the terminal, not to standard out- put.</p>

<p>When it is called with a transfer in progress, the
following additional shell parameters are set:</p>

<p>ZFTP_FILE The name of the remote file being transferred
from or to.</p>

<p>ZFTP_TRANSFER A G for a get operation and a P for a put
operation.</p>

<p>ZFTP_SIZE The total size of the complete file being
transferred: the same as the first value provided by the
remote and local subcommands for a particular file. If the
server cannot supply this value for a remote file being
retrieved, it will not be set. If input is from a pipe the
value may be incorrect and correspond simply to a full pipe
buffer.</p>

<p>ZFTP_COUNT The amount of data so far transferred; a
number between zero and $ZFTP_SIZE, if that is set. This
number is always available.</p>

<p>The function is initially called with ZFTP_TRANSFER set
appro- priately and ZFTP_COUNT set to zero. After the
transfer is fin- ished, the function will be called one more
time with ZFTP_TRANSFER set to GF or PF, in case it wishes
to tidy up. It is otherwise never called twice with the same
value of ZFTP_COUNT.</p>

<p>Sometimes the progress meter may cause disruption. It is
up to the user to decide whether the function should be
defined and to use unfunction when necessary.</p>

<p>Problems A connection may not be opened in the left hand
side of a pipe as this occurs in a subshell and the file
information is not updated in the main shell. In the case of
type or mode changes or closing the connec- tion in a
subshell, the information is returned but variables are not
updated until the next call to zftp. Other status changes in
subshells will not be reflected by changes to the variables
(but should be other- wise harmless).</p>

<p>Deleting sessions while a zftp command is active in the
background can have unexpected effects, even if it does not
use the session being deleted. This is because all shell
subprocesses share information on the state of all
connections, and deleting a session changes the order- ing
of that information.</p>

<p>On some operating systems, the control connection is not
valid after a fork(), so that operations in subshells, on
the left hand side of a pipeline, or in the background are
not possible, as they should be. This is presumably a bug in
the operating system.</p>

<p>THE ZSH/ZLE MODULE The zsh/zle module contains the Zsh
Line Editor. See zshzle(1).</p>

<p>THE ZSH/ZLEPARAMETER MODULE The zsh/zleparameter module
defines two special parameters that can be used to access
internal information of the Zsh Line Editor (see
zshzle(1)).</p>

<p>keymaps This array contains the names of the keymaps
currently defined.</p>

<p>widgets This associative array contains one entry per
widget defined. The name of the widget is the key and the
value gives informa- tion about the widget. It is either the
string builtin for builtin widgets, a string of the form
user:name for user-defined widgets, where name is the name
of the shell func- tion implementing the widget, or it is a
string of the form completion:type:name, for completion
widgets. In the last case type is the name of the builtin
widgets the completion widget imitates in its behavior and
name is the name of the shell func- tion implementing the
completion widget.</p>

<p>THE ZSH/ZPROF MODULE When loaded, the zsh/zprof causes
shell functions to be profiled. The profiling results can be
obtained with the zprof builtin command made available by
this module. There is no way to turn profiling off other
than unloading the module.</p>

<p>zprof [ -c ] Without the -c option, zprof lists
profiling results to standard output. The format is
comparable to that of commands like gprof.</p>

<p>At the top there is a summary listing all functions that
were called at least once. This summary is sorted in
decreasing order of the amount of time spent in each. The
lines contain the number of the function in order, which is
used in other parts of the list in suffixes of the form
[num].RE, then the number of calls made to the function. The
next three columns list the time in milliseconds spent in
the function and its descendants, the average time in
milliseconds spent in the func- tion and its descendants per
call and the percentage of time spent in all shell functions
used in this function and its descendants. The following
three columns give the same informa- tion, but counting only
the time spent in the function itself. The final column
shows the name of the function.</p>

<p>After the summary, detailed information about every
function that was invoked is listed, sorted in decreasing
order of the amount of time spent in each function and its
descendants. Each of these entries consists of descriptions
for the functions that called the function described, the
function itself, and the functions that were called from it.
The description for the function itself has the same format
as in the summary (and shows the same information). The
other lines dont show the number of the function at the
beginning and have their function named indented to make it
easier to distinguish the line showing the function
described in the section from the surrounding lines.</p>

<p>The information shown in this case is almost the same as
in the summary, but only refers to the call hierarchy being
displayed. For example, for a calling function the column
showing the total running time lists the time spent in the
described function and its descendants only for the times
when it was called from that particular calling function.
Likewise, for a called function, this columns lists the
total time spent in the called function and its descendants
only for the times when it was called from the function
described.</p>

<p>Also in this case, the column showing the number of
calls to a function also shows a slash and then the total
number of invoca- tions made to the called function.</p>

<p>As long as the zsh/zprof module is loaded, profiling
will be done and multiple invocations of the zprof builtin
command will show the times and numbers of calls since the
module was loaded. With the -c option, the zprof builtin
command will reset its internal counters and will not show
the listing. )</p>

<p>THE ZSH/ZPTY MODULE The zsh/zpty module offers one
builtin:</p>

<p>zpty [ -e ] [ -b ] name [ arg ... ] The arguments
following name are concatenated with spaces between, then
executed as a command, as if passed to the eval builtin. The
command runs under a newly assigned pseudo-termi- nal; this
is useful for running commands non-interactively which
expect an interactive environment. The name is not part of
the command, but is used to refer to this command in later
calls to zpty.</p>

<p>With the -e option, the pseudo-terminal is set up so
that input characters are echoed.</p>

<p>With the -b option, input to and output from the
pseudo-terminal are made non-blocking.</p>

<p>zpty -d [ names ... ] The second form, with the -d
option, is used to delete commands previously started, by
supplying a list of their names. If no names are given, all
commands are deleted. Deleting a command causes the HUP
signal to be sent to the corresponding process.</p>

<p>zpty -w [ -n ] name [ strings ... ] The -w option can be
used to send the to command name the given strings as input
(separated by spaces). If the -n option is not given, a
newline is added at the end.</p>

<p>If no strings are provided, the standard input is copied
to the pseudo-terminal; this may stop before copying the
full input if the pseudo-terminal is non-blocking.</p>

<p>Note that the command under the pseudo-terminal sees
this input as if it were typed, so beware when sending
special tty driver characters such as word-erase, line-kill,
and end-of-file.</p>

<p>zpty -r [ -mt ] name [ param [ pattern ] ] The -r option
can be used to read the output of the command name. With
only a name argument, the output read is copied to the
standard output. Unless the pseudo-terminal is non-block-
ing, copying continues until the command under the
pseudo-termi- nal exits; when non-blocking, only as much
output as is immedi- ately available is copied. The return
status is zero if any output is copied.</p>

<p>When also given a param argument, at most one line is
read and stored in the parameter named param. Less than a
full line may be read if the pseudo-terminal is
non-blocking. The return sta- tus is zero if at least one
character is stored in param.</p>

<p>If a pattern is given as well, output is read until the
whole string read matches the pattern, even in the
non-blocking case. The return status is zero if the string
read matches the pat- tern, or if the command has exited but
at least one character could still be read. If the option -m
is present, the return status is zero only if the pattern
matches. As of this writing, a maximum of one megabyte of
output can be consumed this way; if a full megabyte is read
without matching the pattern, the return status is
non-zero.</p>

<p>In all cases, the return status is non-zero if nothing
could be read, and is 2 if this is because the command has
finished.</p>

<p>If the -r option is combined with the -t option, zpty
tests whether output is available before trying to read. If
no output is available, zpty immediately returns the status
1. When used with a pattern, the behaviour on a failed poll
is similar to when the command has exited: the return value
is zero if at least one character could still be read even
if the pattern failed to match.</p>

<p>zpty -t name The -t option without the -r option can be
used to test whether the command name is still running. It
returns a zero status if the command is running and a
non-zero value otherwise.</p>

<p>zpty [ -L ] The last form, without any arguments, is
used to list the com- mands currently defined. If the -L
option is given, this is done in the form of calls to the
zpty builtin.</p>

<p>THE ZSH/ZSELECT MODULE The zsh/zselect module makes
available one builtin command:</p>

<p>zselect [ -rwe -t timeout -a array ] [ fd ... ] The
zselect builtin is a front-end to the select system call,
which blocks until a file descriptor is ready for reading or
writing, or has an error condition, with an optional
timeout. If this is not available on your system, the
command prints an error message and returns status 2 (normal
errors return status 1). For more information, see your
systems documentation for select(3). Note there is no
connection with the shell builtin of the same name.</p>

<p>Arguments and options may be intermingled in any order.
Non-option arguments are file descriptors, which must be
decimal integers. By default, file descriptors are to be
tested for reading, i.e. zselect will return when data is
available to be read from the file descriptor, or more
precisely, when a read operation from the file descriptor
will not block. After a -r, -w and -e, the given file
descriptors are to be tested for read- ing, writing, or
error conditions. These options and an arbi- trary list of
file descriptors may be given in any order.</p>

<p>(The presence of an error condition is not well defined
in the documentation for many implementations of the select
system call. According to recent versions of the POSIX
specification, it is really an exception condition, of which
the only standard example is out-of-band data received on a
socket. So zsh users are unlikely to find the -e option
useful.)</p>

<p>The option -t timeout specifies a timeout in hundredths
of a second. This may be zero, in which case the file
descriptors will simply be polled and zselect will return
immediately. It is possible to call zselect with no file
descriptors and a non-zero timeout for use as a
finer-grained replacement for sleep ; not, however, the
return status is always 1 for a time- out.</p>

<p>The option -a array indicates that array should be set
to indicate the file descriptor(s) which are ready. If the
option is not given, the array reply will be used for this
purpose. The array will contain a string similar to the
arguments for zselect. For example,</p>

<p>zselect -t 0 -r 0 -w 1</p>

<p>might return immediately with status 0 and $reply
containing -r 0 -w 1 to show that both file descriptors are
ready for the requested operations.</p>

<p>The option -A assoc indicates that the associative array
assoc should be set to indicate the file descriptor(s( which
are ready. This option overrides the option -a, nor will
reply be modified. The keys of assoc are the file
descriptors, and the corresponding values are any of the
characters rwe to indicate the condition.</p>

<p>The command returns status 0 if some file descriptors
are ready for reading. If the operation timed out, or a
timeout of 0 was given and no file descriptors were ready,
or there was an error, it returns status 1 and the array
will not be set (nor modified in any way). If there was an
error in the select operation the appropriate error message
is printed.</p>

<p>THE ZSH/ZUTIL MODULE The zsh/zutil module only adds some
builtins:</p>

<p>zstyle [ -L [ pattern [ style ] ] ] zstyle [ -e | - | --
] pattern style strings ... zstyle -d [ pattern [ styles ...
] ] zstyle -g name [ pattern [ style ] ] zstyle -abs context
style name [ sep ] zstyle -Tt context style [ strings ...]
zstyle -m context style pattern This builtin command is used
to define and lookup styles. Styles are pairs of names and
values, where the values consist of any number of strings.
They are stored together with pat- terns and lookup is done
by giving a string, called the con- text, which is compared
to the patterns. The definition stored for the first
matching pattern will be returned.</p>

<p>For ordering of comparisons, patterns are searched from
most specific to least specific, and patterns that are
equally spe- cific keep the order in which they were
defined. A pattern is considered to be more specific than
another if it contains more components (substrings separated
by colons) or if the patterns for the components are more
specific, where simple strings are considered to be more
specific than patterns and complex pat- terns are considered
to be more specific than the pattern *.</p>

<p>The first form (without arguments) lists the
definitions. Styles are shown in alphabetic order and
patterns are shown in the order zstyle will test them.</p>

<p>If the -L option is given, listing is done in the form
of calls to zstyle. The optional first argument is a pattern
which will be matched against the string supplied as the
pattern for the context; note that this means, for example,
zstyle -L &quot;:comple- tion:*&quot; will match any
supplied pattern beginning :comple- tion: , not just
&quot;:completion:*&quot;: use &quot;:completion*&quot; to
match that. The optional second argument limits the output
to a spe- cific style (not a pattern). -L is not compatible
with any other options.</p>

<p>The other forms are the following:</p>

<p>zstyle [ - | -- | -e ] pattern style strings ... Defines
the given style for the pattern with the strings as the
value. If the -e option is given, the strings will be
concatenated (separated by spaces) and the resulting string
will be evaluated (in the same way as it is done by the eval
builtin command) when the style is looked up. In this case
the parameter reply must be assigned to set the strings
returned after the evalua- tion. Before evaluating the
value, reply is unset, and if it is still unset after the
evaluation, the style is treated as if it were not set.</p>

<p>zstyle -d [ pattern [ styles ... ] ] Delete style
definitions. Without arguments all defini- tions are
deleted, with a pattern all definitions for that pattern are
deleted and if any styles are given, then only those styles
are deleted for the pattern.</p>

<p>zstyle -g name [ pattern [ style ] ] Retrieve a style
definition. The name is used as the name of an array in
which the results are stored. Without any further arguments,
all patterns defined are returned. With a pattern the styles
defined for that pattern are returned and with both a
pattern and a style, the value strings of that combination
is returned.</p>

<p>The other forms can be used to look up or test
patterns.</p>

<p>zstyle -s context style name [ sep ] The parameter name
is set to the value of the style interpreted as a string. If
the value contains several strings they are concatenated
with spaces (or with the sep string if that is given)
between them.</p>

<p>zstyle -b context style name The value is stored in name
as a boolean, i.e. as the string yes if the value has only
one string and that string is equal to one of yes, true, on,
or 1. If the value is any other string or has more than one
string, the parameter is set to no.</p>

<p>zstyle -a context style name The value is stored in name
as an array. If name is declared as an associative array,
the first, third, etc. strings are used as the keys and the
other strings are used as the values.</p>

<p>zstyle -t context style [ strings ...] zstyle -T context
style [ strings ...] Test the value of a style, i.e. the -t
option only returns a status (sets $?). Without any strings
the return status is zero if the style is defined for at
least one matching pattern, has only one string in its
value, and that is equal to one of true, yes , on or 1 . If
any strings are given the status is zero if and only if at
least one of the strings is equal to at least one of the
strings in the value. If the style is not defined, the
status is 2.</p>

<p>The -T option tests the values of the style like -t, but
it returns status zero (rather than 2) if the style is not
defined for any matching pattern.</p>

<p>zstyle -m context style pattern Match a value. Returns
status zero if the pattern matches at least one of the
strings in the value.</p>

<p>zformat -f param format specs ... zformat -a array sep
specs ... This builtin provides two different forms of
formatting. The first form is selected with the -f option.
In this case the for- mat string will be modified by
replacing sequences starting with a percent sign in it with
strings from the specs. Each spec should be of the form
char:string which will cause every appearance of the
sequence %char in format to be replaced by the string. The %
sequence may also contain optional minimum and maximum field
width specifications between the % and the char in the form
%min.maxc, i.e. the minimum field width is given first and
if the maximum field width is used, it has to be preceded by
a dot. Specifying a minimum field width makes the result be
padded with spaces to the right if the string is shorter
than the requested width. Padding to the left can be
achieved by giving a negative minimum field width. If a
maximum field width is specified, the string will be
truncated after that many characters. After all % sequences
for the given specs have been processed, the resulting
string is stored in the parameter param.</p>

<p>The %-escapes also understand ternary expressions in the
form used by prompts. The % is followed by a ( and then an
ordi- nary format specifier character as described above.
There may be a set of digits either before or after the (;
these specify a test number, which defaults to zero.
Negative numbers are also allowed. An arbitrary delimiter
character follows the for- mat specifier, which is followed
by a piece of true text, the delimiter character again, a
piece of false text, and a clos- ing parenthesis. The
complete expression (without the digits) thus looks like
%(X.text1.text2), except that the . charac- ter is
arbitrary. The value given for the format specifier in the
char:string expressions is evaluated as a mathematical
expression, and compared with the test number. If they are
the same, text1 is output, else text2 is output. A
parenthesis may be escaped in text2 as %). Either of text1
or text2 may contain nested %-escapes.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>zformat -f REPLY &quot;The answer is%3(c.yes.no.&quot;
c:3</p>

<p>outputs &quot;The answer is yes.&quot; to REPLY since
the value for the format specifier c is 3, agreeing with the
digit argument to the ternary expression.</p>

<p>The second form, using the -a option, can be used for
aligning strings. Here, the specs are of the form left:right
where left and right are arbitrary strings. These strings
are modified by replacing the colons by the sep string and
padding the left strings with spaces to the right so that
the sep strings in the result (and hence the right strings
after them) are all aligned if the strings are printed below
each other. All strings without a colon are left unchanged
and all strings with an empty right string have the trailing
colon removed. In both cases the lengths of the strings are
not used to determine how the other strings are to be
aligned. The resulting strings are stored in the array.</p>

<p>zregexparse This implements some internals of the
_regex_arguments function.</p>

<p>zparseopts [ -D ] [ -K ] [ -E ] [ -a array ] [ -A assoc
] specs This builtin simplifies the parsing of options in
positional parameters, i.e. the set of arguments given by
$*. Each spec describes one option and must be of the form
opt[=array]. If an option described by opt is found in the
positional parameters it is copied into the array specified
with the -a option; if the optional =array is given, it is
instead copied into that array.</p>

<p>Note that it is an error to give any spec without an
=array unless one of the -a or -A options is used.</p>

<p>Unless the -E option is given, parsing stops at the
first string that isnt described by one of the specs. Even
with -E, parsing always stops at a positional parameter
equal to - or --.</p>

<p>The opt description must be one of the following. Any of
the special characters can appear in the option name
provided it is preceded by a backslash.</p>

<p>name name+ The name is the name of the option without
the leading -. To specify a GNU-style long option, one of
the usual two leading - must be included in name; for exam-
ple, a --file option is represented by a name of -file.</p>

<p>If a + appears after name, the option is appended to
array each time it is found in the positional parameters;
without the + only the last occurrence of the option is
preserved.</p>

<p>If one of these forms is used, the option takes no argu-
ment, so parsing stops if the next positional parameter does
not also begin with - (unless the -E option is used).</p>

<p>name: name:- name:: If one or two colons are given, the
option takes an argu- ment; with one colon, the argument is
mandatory and with two colons it is optional. The argument
is appended to the array after the option itself.</p>

<p>An optional argument is put into the same array element
as the option name (note that this makes empty strings as
arguments indistinguishable). A mandatory argument is added
as a separate element unless the :- form is used, in which
case the argument is put into the same element.</p>

<p>A + as described above may appear between the name and
the first colon.</p>

<p>The options of zparseopts itself are:</p>

<p>-a array As described above, this names the default
array in which to store the recognised options.</p>

<p>-A assoc If this is given, the options and their values
are also put into an associative array with the option names
as keys and the argu- ments (if any) as the values.</p>

<p>-D If this option is given, all options found are
removed from the positional parameters of the calling shell
or shell function, up to but not including any not described
by the specs. This is similar to using the shift
builtin.</p>

<p>-K With this option, the arrays specified with the -a
and -A options and with the =array forms are kept unchanged
when none of the specs for them is used. This allows
assignment of default values to them before calling
zparseopts.</p>

<p>-E This changes the parsing rules to not stop at the
first string that isnt described by one of the specs. It can
be used to test for or (if used together with -D) extract
options and their arguments, ignoring all other options and
arguments that may be in the positional parameters.</p>

<p>For example,</p>

<p>set -- -a -bx -c y -cz baz -cend zparseopts a=foo b:=bar
c+:=bar</p>

<p>will have the effect of</p>

<p>foo=(-a) bar=(-b x -c y -c z)</p>

<p>The arguments from baz on will not be used.</p>

<p>As an example for the -E option, consider:</p>

<p>set -- -a x -b y -c z arg1 arg2 zparseopts -E -D
b:=bar</p>

<p>will have the effect of</p>

<p>bar=(-b y) set -- -a x -c z arg1 arg2</p>

<p>I.e., the option -b and its arguments are taken from the
positional parameters and put into the array bar.</p>
