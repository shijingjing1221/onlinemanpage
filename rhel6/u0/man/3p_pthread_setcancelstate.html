<p>PTHREAD_SETCANCELSTATE(3P) POSIX Programmer s
ManualPTHREAD_SETCANCELSTATE(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME pthread_setcancelstate, pthread_setcanceltype,
pthread_testcancel - set cancelability state</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;</p>

<p>int pthread_setcancelstate(int state, int *oldstate);
int pthread_setcanceltype(int type, int *oldtype); void
pthread_testcancel(void);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pthread_setcancelstate() function shall
atomically both set the calling threads cancelability state
to the indicated state and return the previous cancelability
state at the location referenced by old- state. Legal values
for state are PTHREAD_CANCEL_ENABLE and
PTHREAD_CANCEL_DISABLE.</p>

<p>The pthread_setcanceltype() function shall atomically
both set the calling threads cancelability type to the
indicated type and return the previous cancelability type at
the location referenced by oldtype. Legal values for type
are PTHREAD_CANCEL_DEFERRED and PTHREAD_CAN-
CEL_ASYNCHRONOUS.</p>

<p>The cancelability state and type of any newly created
threads, includ- ing the thread in which main() was first
invoked, shall be PTHREAD_CAN- CEL_ENABLE and
PTHREAD_CANCEL_DEFERRED respectively.</p>

<p>The pthread_testcancel() function shall create a
cancellation point in the calling thread. The
pthread_testcancel() function shall have no effect if
cancelability is disabled.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE If successful, the pthread_setcancelstate()
and pthread_setcanceltype() functions shall return zero;
otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate the
error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The pthread_setcancelstate() function may fail
if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The specified state is not PTHREAD_CANCEL_ENABLE
or PTHREAD_CAN- CEL_DISABLE.</p>

<p>The pthread_setcanceltype() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The specified type is not PTHREAD_CANCEL_DEFERRED
or PTHREAD_CANCEL_ASYNCHRONOUS.</p>

<p>These functions shall not return an error code of
[EINTR].</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The pthread_setcancelstate() and
pthread_setcanceltype() functions con- trol the points at
which a thread may be asynchronously canceled. For
cancellation control to be usable in modular fashion, some
rules need to be followed.</p>

<p>An object can be considered to be a generalization of a
procedure. It is a set of procedures and global variables
written as a unit and called by clients not known by the
object. Objects may depend on other objects.</p>

<p>First, cancelability should only be disabled on entry to
an object, never explicitly enabled. On exit from an object,
the cancelability state should always be restored to its
value on entry to the object.</p>

<p>This follows from a modularity argument: if the client
of an object (or the client of an object that uses that
object) has disabled cancelabil- ity, it is because the
client does not want to be concerned about cleaning up if
the thread is canceled while executing some sequence of
actions. If an object is called in such a state and it
enables cancela- bility and a cancellation request is
pending for that thread, then the thread is canceled,
contrary to the wish of the client that disabled.</p>

<p>Second, the cancelability type may be explicitly set to
either deferred or asynchronous upon entry to an object. But
as with the cancelability state, on exit from an object the
cancelability type should always be restored to its value on
entry to the object.</p>

<p>Finally, only functions that are cancel-safe may be
called from a thread that is asynchronously cancelable.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
