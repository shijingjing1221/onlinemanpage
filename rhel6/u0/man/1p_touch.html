<p>TOUCH(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual TOUCH(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME touch - change file access and modification
times</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS touch [-acm][ -r ref_file| -t time] file...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The touch utility shall change the
modification times, access times, or both of files. The
modification time shall be equivalent to the value of the
st_mtime member of the stat structure for a file, as
described in the System Interfaces volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001; the access time shall be equivalent to the
value of st_atime.</p>

<p>The time used can be specified by the -t time
option-argument, the cor- responding time fields of the file
referenced by the -r ref_file option-argument, or the
date_time operand, as specified in the follow- ing sections.
If none of these are specified, touch shall use the cur-
rent time (the value returned by the equivalent of the
time() function defined in the System Interfaces volume of
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001).</p>

<p>For each file operand, touch shall perform actions
equivalent to the following functions defined in the System
Interfaces volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001:</p>

<p>1. If file does not exist, a creat() function call is
made with the file operand used as the path argument and the
value of the bit- wise-inclusive OR of S_IRUSR, S_IWUSR,
S_IRGRP, S_IWGRP, S_IROTH, and S_IWOTH used as the mode
argument.</p>

<p>2. The utime() function is called with the following
arguments:</p>

<p>a. The file operand is used as the path argument.</p>

<p>b. The utimbuf structure members actime and modtime are
determined as described in the OPTIONS section.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The touch utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>The following options shall be supported:</p>

<p>-a Change the access time of file. Do not change the
modification time unless -m is also specified.</p>

<p>-c Do not create a specified file if it does not exist.
Do not write any diagnostic messages concerning this
condition.</p>

<p>-m Change the modification time of file. Do not change
the access time unless -a is also specified.</p>

<p>-r ref_file Use the corresponding time of the file named
by the pathname ref_file instead of the current time.</p>

<p>-t time Use the specified time instead of the current
time. The option- argument shall be a decimal number of the
form:</p>

<p>[[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.SS]</p>

<p>where each two digits represents the following:</p>

<p>MM The month of the year [01,12].</p>

<p>DD The day of the month [01,31].</p>

<p>hh The hour of the day [00,23].</p>

<p>mm The minute of the hour [00,59].</p>

<p>CC The first two digits of the year (the century).</p>

<p>YY The second two digits of the year.</p>

<p>SS The second of the minute [00,60].</p>

<p>Both CC and YY shall be optional. If neither is given,
the current year shall be assumed. If YY is specified, but
CC is not, CC shall be derived as follows:</p>

<p>If YY is: CC becomes: [69,99] 19 [00,68] 20</p>

<p>Note: It is expected that in a future version of IEEE
Std 1003.1-2001 the default century inferred from a 2-digit
year will change. (This would apply to all commands
accepting a 2-digit year as input.)</p>

<p>The resulting time shall be affected by the value of the
TZ environment variable. If the resulting time value
precedes the Epoch, touch shall exit immediately with an
error status. The range of valid times past the Epoch is
implementation-defined, but it shall extend to at least the
time 0 hours, 0 minutes, 0 seconds, January 1, 2038,
Coordinated Universal Time. Some implementations may not be
able to represent dates beyond January 18, 2038, because
they use signed int as a time holder.</p>

<p>The range for SS is [00,60] rather than [00,59] because
of leap sec- onds. If SS is 60, and the resulting time, as
affected by the TZ envi- ronment variable, does not refer to
a leap second, the resulting time shall be one second after
a time where SS is 59. If SS is not given a value, it is
assumed to be zero.</p>

<p>If neither the -a nor -m options were specified, touch
shall behave as if both the -a and -m options were
specified.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operands shall be supported:</p>

<p>file A pathname of a file whose times shall be
modified.</p>

<p>STDIN Not used.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of touch:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in
arguments).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>TZ Determine the timezone to be used for interpreting
the time option-argument. If TZ is unset or null, an
unspecified default timezone shall be used.</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT Not used.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 The utility executed successfully and all requested
changes were made.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The interpretation of time is taken to
be seconds since the Epoch (see the Base Definitions volume
of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 4.14, Sec- onds Since the
Epoch). It should be noted that implementations conform- ing
to the System Interfaces volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 do
not take leap seconds into account when computing seconds
since the Epoch. When SS=60 is used, the resulting time
always refers to 1 plus seconds since the Epoch for a time
when SS=59.</p>

<p>Although the -t time option-argument specifies values in
1969, the access time and modification time fields are
defined in terms of sec- onds since the Epoch (00:00:00 on 1
January 1970 UTC). Therefore, depending on the value of TZ
when touch is run, there is never more than a few valid
hours in 1969 and there need not be any valid times in
1969.</p>

<p>One ambiguous situation occurs if -t time is not
specified, -r ref_file is not specified, and the first
operand is an eight or ten-digit deci- mal number. A
portable script can avoid this problem by using:</p>

<p>touch -- file</p>

<p>or:</p>

<p>touch ./file</p>

<p>in this case.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The functionality of touch is described almost
entirely through refer- ences to functions in the System
Interfaces volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001. In this way,
there is no duplication of effort required for describing
such side effects as the relationship of user IDs to the
user database, permissions, and so on.</p>

<p>There are some significant differences between the touch
utility in this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 and those in
System V and BSD sys- tems. They are upwards-compatible for
historical applications from both implementations:</p>

<p>1. In System V, an ambiguity exists when a pathname that
is a decimal number leads the operands; it is treated as a
time value. In BSD, no time value is allowed; files may only
be touched to the current time. The -t time construct solves
these problems for future con- forming applications (note
that the -t option is not historical practice).</p>

<p>2. The inclusion of the century digits, CC, is also new.
Note that a ten-digit time value is treated as if YY, and
not CC, were speci- fied. The caveat about the range of
dates following the Epoch was included as recognition that
some implementations are not able to represent dates beyond
18 January 2038 because they use signed int as a time
holder.</p>

<p>The -r option was added because several comments
requested this capa- bility. This option was named -f in an
early proposal, but was changed because the -f option is
used in the BSD version of touch with a dif- ferent
meaning.</p>

<p>At least one historical implementation of touch
incremented the exit code if -c was specified and the file
did not exist. This volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 requires
exit status zero if no errors occur.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS Applications should use the -r or -t
options.</p>
