<p>NAME pamsplit - split a multi-image PNM/PAM file into
single-image files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pamsplit</p>

<p>[netpbmfile</p>

<p>[ output_file_pattern]]</p>

<p>[-padname=n]</p>

<p>Minimum unique abbreviation of option is acceptable. You
may use dou- ble hyphens instead of single hyphen to denote
options. You may use white space in place of the equals sign
to separate an option name from its value.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pamsplit reads a PNM or PAM stream as input. It copies
each image in the input into a separate file, in the same
format.</p>

<p>netpbmfile is the file specification of the input file,
or - to indi- cate Standard Input. The default is Standard
Input.</p>

<p>output_file_pattern tells how to name the output files.
It is the file specification of the output file, except that
the first occurence of %d in it is replaced by the image
sequence number in unpadded ASCII decimal, with the sequence
starting at 0. If there is no %d in the pattern, pamsplit
fails.</p>

<p>The default output file pattern is image%d.</p>

<p>The -padname option specifies to how many characters you
want the image sequence number in the output file name
padded with zeroes. pamsplit adds leading zeroes to the
image sequence number to get up to at least that number of
characters. This is just the number of characters in the
sequence number part of the name. For example, pamsplit -
output- file%d.ppm -padname=3 would yield output filenames
outputfile000.ppm, outputfile001.ppm, etc.</p>

<p>The default is no padding (equivalent to -padname=0.</p>

<p>The -padname option was new in Netpbm 10.23 (July 2004).
Before that, there was never any padding.</p>

<p>Note that to do the reverse operation (combining
multiple single-image Netpbm files into a multi-image one),
there is no special Netpbm pro- gram. Just use cat.</p>

<p>If you just want to find out basic information about the
images in a stream, you can use pamfile on the stream.</p>

<p>To extract images from a stream and generate a single
stream containing them, use pampick.</p>
