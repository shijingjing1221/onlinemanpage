<p>TUNED_ADM(1) TUNED_ADM(1)</p>

<p>NAME tuned-adm - commandline tool for switching between
different tuning profiles</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS tuned-adm [ help , list , active , profile
&lt;profile&gt; , off ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This command line utility allows user to
switch between user definable tuning profiles. Several
predefined profiles are already included for some of the
more common cases. Although the profiles typically refer to
a common use case you can of course switch to any profile on
any sys- tem. So switching to the laptop-battery-powersave
profile on a server will activate this profile on it. This
way, depending on your require- ments you can select any of
the profiles that fits your needs. You can even create your
own profile, either based on one of the existing ones by
copying it or make a completely new one. The profiles are
stored in subdirectories below /etc/tune-profiles.</p>

<p>The power saving profiles contain settings that are
typically not enabled by default as they will noticeably
impact the latency/perfor- mance of your system as opposed
to the power saving mechanisms we have enabled by default.
On the other hand the performance profiles disable the
additional power saving mechanisms of tuned and ktune as
they would negatively impact the performance tuning, be it
throughput or latency.</p>

<p>OPTIONS help Print out the list of commands. Its also
the default if you start tuned-adm without any commands.</p>

<p>list List all available profiles.</p>

<p>active Show current active profile.</p>

<p>profile &lt;profile&gt; Switches to the given
profilename. If none is given or no valid one is given the
command gracefully exits without performing any
operation.</p>

<p>off Switch off all ktune and tuned settings and remove
them from services. The configuration file are set to
previous settings.</p>

<p>PREDEFINED PROFILES At the moment were providing the
following pre defined profiles:</p>

<p>default This is the default powersaving profile. It is
the lowest of the available profiles in regard to
powersaving and only enables CPU and disk plugins of
tuned.</p>

<p>desktop-powersave A powersaving profile directed at
desktop systems. Enables ALPM powersaving for SATA host
adapters as well as the CPU, ethernet and disk plugins of
tuned.</p>

<p>server-powersave A powersaving profile directed at
server systems. Enables ALPM powersaving for SATA host
adapters, disables CD-ROM polling via hal and activates the
CPU and disk plugins of tuned.</p>

<p>laptop-ac-powersave Medium powersaving profile directed
at laptops running on AC. Enables ALPM powersaving for SATA
host adapters, WiFi power saving as well as CPU, ethernet
and disk plugins of tuned.</p>

<p>laptop-battery-powersave Strong powersaving profile
directed at laptops running on bat- tery. It activates all
power saving mechanisms from the previous profiles plus it
enables multi core power savings scheduler for low wakeup
systems and makes sure the ondemand governor is active and
the AC97 audio power saving is enabled. This profile can be
used for any kind of system, not only laptops on battery
power in order to save the maximum amount of power. The
tradeoff for this profile is a noticeable impact on
performance, specifi- cally latency of disk and network
IO.</p>

<p>throughput-performance Sever profile for typical
throughput performance tuning. Dis- ables tuned and ktune
power saving mechanisms and enables sysctl settings that
improve the throughput performance of your disk and network
IO and switches to the deadline scheduler.</p>

<p>latency-performance Sever profile for typical latency
performance tuning. Disables tuned and ktune power saving
mechanisms and enables sysctl set- tings that improve the
latency performance of your network IO.</p>
