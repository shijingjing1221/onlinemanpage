<p>NAME git-apply - Apply a patch to files and/or to the
index</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS git apply [--stat] [--numstat] [--summary]
[--check] [--index] [--apply] [--no-add]
[--build-fake-ancestor=&lt;file&gt;] [-R | --reverse]
[--allow-binary-replacement | --binary] [--reject] [-z]
[-pNUM] [-CNUM] [--inaccurate-eof] [--recount] [--cached]
[--ignore-space-change | --ignore-whitespace ]
[--whitespace=&lt;nowarn|warn|fix|error|error-all&gt;]
[--exclude=PATH] [--include=PATH] [--directory=&lt;root&gt;]
[--verbose] [&lt;patch&gt;...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Reads the supplied diff output (i.e. &quot;a
patch&quot;) and applies it to files. With the --index
option the patch is also applied to the index, and with the
--cache option the patch is only applied to the index.
Without these options, the command applies the patch only to
files, and does not require them to be in a git
repository.</p>

<p>OPTIONS &lt;patch&gt;... The files to read the patch
from. - can be used to read from the standard input.</p>

<p>--stat Instead of applying the patch, output diffstat
for the input. Turns off &quot;apply&quot;.</p>

<p>--numstat Similar to --stat, but shows the number of
added and deleted lines in decimal notation and the pathname
without abbreviation, to make it more machine friendly. For
binary files, outputs two - instead of saying 0 0. Turns off
&quot;apply&quot;.</p>

<p>--summary Instead of applying the patch, output a
condensed summary of information obtained from git diff
extended headers, such as creations, renames and mode
changes. Turns off &quot;apply&quot;.</p>

<p>--check Instead of applying the patch, see if the patch
is applicable to the current working tree and/or the index
file and detects errors. Turns off &quot;apply&quot;.</p>

<p>--index When --check is in effect, or when applying the
patch (which is the default when none of the options that
disables it is in effect), make sure the patch is applicable
to what the current index file records. If the file to be
patched in the working tree is not up-to-date, it is flagged
as an error. This flag also causes the index file to be
updated.</p>

<p>--cached Apply a patch without touching the working
tree. Instead take the cached data, apply the patch, and
store the result in the index without using the working
tree. This implies --index.</p>

<p>--build-fake-ancestor=&lt;file&gt; Newer git diff output
has embedded index information for each blob to help
identify the original version that the patch applies to.
When this flag is given, and if the original versions of the
blobs are available locally, builds a temporary index
containing those blobs.</p>

<p>When a pure mode change is encountered (which has no
index information), the information is read from the current
index instead.</p>

<p>-R, --reverse Apply the patch in reverse.</p>

<p>--reject For atomicity, git apply by default fails the
whole patch and does not touch the working tree when some of
the hunks do not apply. This option makes it apply the parts
of the patch that are applicable, and leave the rejected
hunks in corresponding *.rej files.</p>

<p>-z When --numstat has been given, do not munge
pathnames, but use a NUL-terminated machine-readable
format.</p>

<p>Without this option, each pathname output will have TAB,
LF, double quotes, and backslash characters replaced with ,
0 respectively, and the pathname will be enclosed in double
quotes if any of those replacements occurred.</p>

<p>-p&lt;n&gt; Remove &lt;n&gt; leading slashes from
traditional diff paths. The default is 1.</p>

<p>-C&lt;n&gt; Ensure at least &lt;n&gt; lines of
surrounding context match before and after each change. When
fewer lines of surrounding context exist they all must
match. By default no context is ever ignored.</p>

<p>--unidiff-zero By default, git apply expects that the
patch being applied is a unified diff with at least one line
of context. This provides good safety measures, but breaks
down when applying a diff generated with --unified=0. To
bypass these checks use --unidiff-zero.</p>

<p>Note, for the reasons stated above usage of context-free
patches is discouraged.</p>

<p>--apply If you use any of the options marked &quot;Turns
off apply&quot; above, git apply reads and outputs the
requested information without actually applying the patch.
Give this flag after those flags to also apply the
patch.</p>

<p>--no-add When applying a patch, ignore additions made by
the patch. This can be used to extract the common part
between two files by first running diff on them and applying
the result with this option, which would apply the deletion
part but not the addition part.</p>

<p>--allow-binary-replacement, --binary Historically we did
not allow binary patch applied without an explicit
permission from the user, and this flag was the way to do
so. Currently we always allow binary patch application, so
this is a no-op.</p>

<p>--exclude=&lt;path-pattern&gt; Dont apply changes to
files matching the given path pattern. This can be useful
when importing patchsets, where you want to exclude certain
files or directories.</p>

<p>--include=&lt;path-pattern&gt; Apply changes to files
matching the given path pattern. This can be useful when
importing patchsets, where you want to include certain files
or directories.</p>

<p>When --exclude and --include patterns are used, they are
examined in the order they appear on the command line, and
the first match determines if a patch to each path is used.
A patch to a path that does not match any include/exclude
pattern is used by default if there is no include pattern on
the command line, and ignored if there is any include
pattern.</p>

<p>--ignore-space-change, --ignore-whitespace When applying
a patch, ignore changes in whitespace in context lines if
necessary. Context lines will preserve their whitespace, and
they will not undergo whitespace fixing regardless of the
value of the --whitespace option. New lines will still be
fixed, though.</p>

<p>--whitespace=&lt;action&gt; When applying a patch,
detect a new or modified line that has whitespace errors.
What are considered whitespace errors is controlled by
core.whitespace configuration. By default, trailing
whitespaces (including lines that solely consist of
whitespaces) and a space character that is immediately
followed by a tab character inside the initial indent of the
line are considered whitespace errors.</p>

<p>By default, the command outputs warning messages but
applies the patch. When git-apply is used for statistics and
not applying a patch, it defaults to nowarn.</p>

<p>You can use different &lt;action&gt; values to control
this behavior:</p>

<p>&middot; nowarn turns off the trailing whitespace
warning.</p>

<p>&middot; warn outputs warnings for a few such errors,
but applies the patch as-is (default).</p>

<p>&middot; fix outputs warnings for a few such errors, and
applies the patch after fixing them (strip is a synonym ---
the tool used to consider only trailing whitespace
characters as errors, and the fix involved stripping them,
but modern gits do more).</p>

<p>&middot; error outputs warnings for a few such errors,
and refuses to apply the patch.</p>

<p>&middot; error-all is similar to error but shows all
errors.</p>

<p>--inaccurate-eof Under certain circumstances, some
versions of diff do not correctly detect a missing new-line
at the end of the file. As a result, patches created by such
diff programs do not record incomplete lines correctly. This
option adds support for applying such patches by working
around this bug.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose Report progress to stderr. By default,
only a message about the current patch being applied will be
printed. This option will cause additional information to be
reported.</p>

<p>--recount Do not trust the line counts in the hunk
headers, but infer them by inspecting the patch (e.g. after
editing the patch without adjusting the hunk headers
appropriately).</p>

<p>--directory=&lt;root&gt; Prepend &lt;root&gt; to all
filenames. If a &quot;-p&quot; argument was also passed, it
is applied before prepending the new root.</p>

<p>For example, a patch that talks about updating
a/git-gui.sh to b/git-gui.sh can be applied to the file in
the working tree modules/git-gui/git-gui.sh by running git
apply --directory=modules/git-gui.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION apply.ignorewhitespace Set to change if
you want changes in whitespace to be ignored by default. Set
to one of: no, none, never, false if you want changes in
whitespace to be significant.</p>

<p>apply.whitespace When no --whitespace flag is given from
the command line, this configuration item is used as the
default.</p>

<p>SUBMODULES If the patch contains any changes to
submodules then git apply treats these changes as
follows.</p>

<p>If --index is specified (explicitly or implicitly), then
the submodule commits must match the index exactly for the
patch to apply. If any of the submodules are checked-out,
then these check-outs are completely ignored, i.e., they are
not required to be up-to-date or clean and they are not
updated.</p>

<p>If --index is not specified, then the submodule commits
in the patch are ignored and only the absence or presence of
the corresponding subdirectory is checked and (if possible)
updated.</p>
