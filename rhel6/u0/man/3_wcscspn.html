<p>NAME wcscspn - search a wide-character string for any of
a set of wide char- acters</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;wchar.h&gt;</p>

<p>size_t wcscspn(const wchar_t *wcs, const wchar_t
*reject);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The wcscspn() function is the wide-character
equivalent of the strc- spn(3) function. It determines the
length of the longest initial seg- ment of wcs which
consists entirely of wide-characters not listed in reject.
In other words, it searches for the first occurrence in the
wide-character string wcs of any of the characters in the
wide-charac- ter string reject.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The wcscspn() function returns the number
of wide characters in the longest initial segment of wcs
which consists entirely of wide-charac- ters not listed in
reject. In other words, it returns the position of the first
occurrence in the wide-character string wcs of any of the
characters in the wide-character string reject, or
wcslen(wcs) if there is none.</p>
