<p>ON_EXIT(3) Linux Programmer s Manual ON_EXIT(3)</p>

<p>NAME on_exit - register a function to be called at
normal process termina- tion</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</p>

<p>int on_exit(void (*function)(int , void *), void
*arg);</p>

<p>Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
feature_test_macros(7)):</p>

<p>on_exit(): _BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The on_exit() function registers the given
function to be called at normal process termination, whether
via exit(3) or via return from the programs main(). The
function is passed the status argument given to the last
call to exit(3) and the arg argument from on_exit().</p>

<p>The same function may be registered multiple times: it
is called once for each registration.</p>

<p>When a child process is created via fork(2), it inherits
copies of its parents registrations. Upon a successful call
to one of the exec(3) functions, all registrations are
removed.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The on_exit() function returns the value 0
if successful; otherwise it returns a non-zero value.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO This function comes from SunOS 4, but is
also present in libc4, libc5 and glibc. It no longer occurs
in Solaris (SunOS 5). Avoid this func- tion, and use the
standard atexit(3) instead.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO _exit(2), atexit(3), exit(3)</p>
