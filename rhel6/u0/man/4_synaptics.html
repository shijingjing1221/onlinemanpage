<p>NAME synaptics - touchpad input driver</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS Section &quot;InputDevice&quot; Identifier
&quot;devname&quot; Driver &quot;synaptics&quot; Option
&quot;Device&quot; &quot;devpath&quot; Option
&quot;Path&quot; &quot;path&quot; ... EndSection</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION synaptics is an Xorg input driver for
touchpads. Even though touchpads can be handled by the
normal evdev or mouse drivers, this driver allows more
advanced features of the touchpad to become available. Some
bene- fits would be:</p>

<p>&middot; Movement with adjustable, non-linear
acceleration and speed.</p>

<p>&middot; Button events through short touching of the
touchpad.</p>

<p>&middot; Double-Button events through double short
touching of the touchpad.</p>

<p>&middot; Dragging through short touching and holding
down the finger on the touchpad (tap-and-drag gesture).</p>

<p>&middot; Middle and right button events on the upper and
lower corner of the touchpad.</p>

<p>&middot; Vertical scrolling (button four and five
events) through moving the finger on the right side of the
touchpad.</p>

<p>&middot; The up/down button sends button four/five
events.</p>

<p>&middot; Horizontal scrolling (button six and seven
events) through moving the finger on the lower side of the
touchpad.</p>

<p>&middot; The multi-buttons send button four/five events
for vertical scrolling and button six/seven events for
horizontal scrolling.</p>

<p>&middot; Adjustable finger detection.</p>

<p>&middot; Multifinger taps: two finger for right button
and three finger for middle button events. (Needs hardware
support. Not all models implement this feature.)</p>

<p>&middot; Pressure dependent motion speed.</p>

<p>&middot; Run-time configuration using shared memory.
This means you can change parameter settings without
restarting the X server.</p>

<p>Note that depending on the touchpad firmware, some of
these features might be available even without using the
synaptics driver. Note also that some functions are not
available on all touchpad models, because they need support
from the touchpad hardware/firmware. (Multifinger taps for
example.)</p>

<p>The name &quot;synaptics&quot; is historical and the
driver still provides the synaptics protocol parsing code.
Under Linux however, the hardware- specifics are handled by
the kernel and this driver will work for any touchpad that
has a working kernel driver.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION OPTIONS Please refer to xorg.conf(5) for
general configuration details and for options that can be
used with all input drivers. This section only covers
configuration details specific to this driver.</p>

<p>The following driver Options are supported:</p>

<p>Option &quot;Device&quot; &quot;string&quot; This option
specifies the device file in your &quot;/dev&quot; directory
which will be used to access the physical device. Normally
you should use something like &quot;/dev/input/eventX&quot;,
where X is some integer.</p>

<p>Option &quot;Protocol&quot; &quot;string&quot; Specifies
which kernel driver will be used by this driver. This is the
list of supported drivers and their default use scenar-
ios.</p>

<p>auto-dev automatic, default (recommend) event Linux 2.6
kernel events psaux raw device access (Linux 2.4) psm
FreeBSD psm driver</p>

<p>Option &quot;SHMConfig&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Switch
on/off shared memory for run-time debugging. This option
does not have an effect on run-time configuration anymore
and is only useful for hardware event debugging.</p>

Timeout after a tap to recognize it as a single tap.
Property: &quot;Synaptics Tap Durations&quot;</p>

<p>Option &quot;GrabEventDevice&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
If GrabEventDevice is true, the driver will grab the event
device for exclusive use when using the linux 2.6 event
proto- col. When using other protocols, this option has no
effect. Grabbing the event device means that no other user
space or ker- nel space program sees the touchpad events.
This is desirable if the X config file includes
/dev/input/mice as an input device, but is undesirable if
you want to monitor the device from user space. When
changing this parameter with the syn- client program, the
change will not take effect until the synap- tics driver is
disabled and reenabled. This can be achieved by switching to
a text console and then switching back to X.</p>

<p>Option &quot;TapAndDragGesture&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
Switch on/off the tap-and-drag gesture. This gesture is an
alternative way of dragging. It is performed by tapping
(touch- ing and releasing the finger), then touching again
and moving the finger on the touchpad. The gesture is
enabled by default and can be disabled by setting the
TapAndDragGesture option to false. Property: &quot;Synaptics
Gestures&quot;</p>

<p>Option &quot;VertResolution&quot; &quot;integer&quot;
Resolution of X coordinates in units/millimeter. The value
is used together with HorizResolution to compensate unequal
verti- cal and horizontal sensitivity. Setting
VertResolution and HorizResolution equal values means no
compensation. Default value is read from the touchpad or set
to 1 if value could not be read. Property: &quot;Synaptics
Pad Resolution&quot;</p>

<p>Option &quot;HorizResolution&quot; &quot;integer&quot;
Resolution of Y coordinates in units/millimeter. The value
is used together with VertResolution to compensate unequal
vertical and horizontal sensitivity. Setting VertResolution
and HorizRes- olution equal values means no compensation.
Default value is read from the touchpad or set to 1 if value
could not be read. Property: &quot;Synaptics Pad
Resolution&quot;</p>

<p>Option &quot;AreaLeftEdge&quot; &quot;integer&quot;
Ignore movements, scrolling and tapping which take place
left of this edge. The option is disabled by default and can
be enabled by setting the AreaLeftEdge option to any integer
value other than zero. Property: &quot;Synaptics
Area&quot;</p>

<p>Option &quot;AreaRightEdge&quot; &quot;integer&quot;
Ignore movements, scrolling and tapping which take place
right of this edge. The option is disabled by default and
can be enabled by setting the AreaRightEdge option to any
integer value other than zero. Property: &quot;Synaptics
Area&quot;</p>

<p>Option &quot;AreaTopEdge&quot; &quot;integer&quot;
Ignore movements, scrolling and tapping which take place
above this edge. The option is disabled by default and can
be enabled by setting the AreaTopEdge option to any integer
value other than zero. Property: &quot;Synaptics
Area&quot;</p>

<p>Option &quot;AreaBottomEdge&quot; &quot;integer&quot;
Ignore movements, scrolling and tapping which take place
below this edge. The option is disabled by default and can
be enabled by setting the AreaBottomEdge option to any
integer value other than zero. Property: &quot;Synaptics
Area&quot;</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION DETAILS Area handling The LeftEdge,
RightEdge, TopEdge and BottomEdge parameters are used to
define the edge and corner areas of the touchpad. The
parameters split the touchpad area in 9 pieces, like
this:</p>

<p>| | | LeftEdge | RightEdge +-----+-------------+---+
Physical top edge | 1 | 2 | 3 | +-----+-------------+---+
TopEdge | | | | | 4 | 5 | 6 | | | | |
+-----+-------------+---+ BottomEdge | 7 | 8 | 9 |
+-----+-------------+---+ Physical bottom edge |Physical
left edge | Physical right edge</p>

<p>Coordinates to the left of LeftEdge are part of the left
edge (areas 1, 4 and 7), coordinates to the left of LeftEdge
and above TopEdge (area 1) are part of the upper left
corner, etc.</p>

<p>A good way to find appropriate edge parameters is to
enable the SHMCon- fig option and run &quot;synclient -m
1&quot; to see the x/y coordinates corre- sponding to
different positions on the touchpad.</p>

<p>The perceived physical edges may be adjusted with the
AreaLeftEdge, AreaRightEdge, AreaTopEdge, and AreaBottomEdge
options. If these values are set to something other than the
physical edges, input in the space between the area edge and
the respective physical edge is ignored. Note that this
reduces the available space on the touchpad.</p>

<p>Tapping A tap event happens when the finger is touched
and released in a time interval shorter than MaxTapTime, and
the touch and release coordinates are less than MaxTapMove
units apart. A &quot;touch&quot; event happens when the Z
value goes above FingerHigh, and an &quot;untouch&quot;
event happens when the Z value goes below FingerLow.</p>

<p>The MaxDoubleTapTime parameter has the same function as
the MaxTapTime parameter, but for the second, third, etc tap
in a tap sequence. If you can t perform double clicks fast
enough (for example, xmms depends on fast double clicks),
try reducing this parameter. If you cant get word selection
to work in xterm (ie button down, button up, button down,
move mouse), try increasing this parameter.</p>

<p>The ClickTime parameter controls the delay between the
button down and button up X events generated in response to
a tap event. A too long value can cause undesirable
autorepeat in scroll bars and a too small value means that
visual feedback from the gui application you are interacting
with is harder to see. For this parameter to have any
effect, &quot;FastTaps&quot; has to be disabled.</p>

<p>Acceleration The MinSpeed, MaxSpeed and AccelFactor
parameters control the pointer motion speed. The speed value
defines the scaling between touchpad coordinates and screen
coordinates. When moving the finger very slowly, the
MinSpeed value is used, when moving very fast the MaxSpeed
value is used. When moving the finger at moderate speed, you
get a pointer motion speed somewhere between MinSpeed and
MaxSpeed. If you don t want any acceleration, set MinSpeed
and MaxSpeed to the same value.</p>

<p>The MinSpeed, MaxSpeed and AccelFactor parameters don t
have any effect on scrolling speed. Scrolling speed is
determined solely from the VertScrollDelta and
HorizScrollDelta parameters. To disable vertical or
horizontal scrolling, set VertScrollDelta or
HorizScrollDelta to zero.</p>

<p>When hitting an egde, movement can be automatically
continued. If EdgeMotionUseAlways is false, edge motion is
only used when dragging. With EdgeMotionUseAlways set to
true, it is also used for normal cursor movements.</p>

<p>Edge motion speed is calculated by taking into account
the amount of pressure applied to the touchpad. The
sensitivity can be adjusted using the EdgeMotion parameters.
If the pressure is below EdgeMotion- MinZ,
EdgeMotionMinSpeed is used, and if the pressure is greater
than EdgeMotionMaxZ, EdgeMotionMaxSpeed is used. For a
pressure value between EdgeMotionMinZ and EdgeMotionMaxZ,
the speed is increased lin- early.</p>

<p>When pressure motion is activated, the cursor motion
speed depends on the pressure exerted on the touchpad (the
more pressure exerted on the touchpad, the faster the
pointer). More precisely the speed is first calculated
according to MinSpeed, MaxSpeed and AccelFactor, and then is
multiplied by a sensitivity factor. The sensitivity factor
can be adjusted using the PressureMotion parameters. If the
pressure is below PressureMotionMinZ,
PressureMotionMinFactor is used, and if the pres- sure is
greater than PressureMotionMaxZ, PressureMotionMaxFactor is
used. By default, PressureMotionMinZ and PressureMotionMaxZ
are equal to EdgeMotionMinZ and EdgeMotionMaxZ. For a
pressure value between PressureMotionMinZ and
PressureMotionMaxZ, the factor is increased lin- early.</p>

<p>Middle button emulation Since most synaptics touchpad
models dont have a button that corre- sponds to the middle
button on a mouse, the driver can emulate middle mouse
button events. If you press both the left and right mouse
but- tons at almost the same time (no more than
EmulateMidButtonTime mil- liseconds apart) the driver
generates a middle mouse button event.</p>

<p>Circular scrolling Circular scrolling acts like a
scrolling wheel on the touchpad. Scrolling is engaged when a
drag starts in the given CircScrollTrigger region, which can
be all edges, a particular side, or a particular cor- ner.
Once scrolling is engaged, moving your finger in clockwise
cir- cles around the center of the touchpad will generate
scroll down events and counter clockwise motion will
generate scroll up events. Lifting your finger will
disengage circular scrolling. Use tight circles near the
center of the pad for fast scrolling and large circles for
better control. When used together with vertical scrolling,
hitting the upper or lower right corner will seamlessly
switch over from vertical to cir- cular scrolling.</p>

<p>Coasting Coasting is enabled by setting the
CoastingSpeed parameter to a non- zero value. Coasting comes
in two flavors: conventional (finger off) coasting, and
corner (finger on) coasting.</p>

<p>Conventional coasting is enabled when coasting is
enabled, and Corner- Coasting is set to false. When
conventional coasting is enabled, hori- zontal/vertical
scrolling can continue after the finger is released from the
lower/right edge of the touchpad. The driver computes the
scrolling speed corresponding to the finger speed
immediately before the finger leaves the touchpad. If this
scrolling speed is larger than the CoastingSpeed parameter
(measured in scroll events per second), the scrolling will
continue with the same speed in the same direction until the
finger touches the touchpad again.</p>

<p>Corner coasting is enabled when coasting is enabled, and
CornerCoasting is set to true. When corner coasting is
enabled, edge scrolling can continue as long as the finger
stays in a corner. Coasting begins when the finger enters
the corner, and continues until the finger leaves the
corner. CornerCoasting takes precedence over the seamless
switch from edge scrolling to circular scrolling. That is,
if CornerCoasting is active, scrolling will stop, and
circular scrolling will not start, when the finger leaves
the corner.</p>

<p>Trackstick mode Trackstick emulation mode is entered
when pressing the finger hard on the touchpad. The
FingerPress parameter controls the minimum required finger
pressure. If the finger hasn t moved more than MaxTapMove
after MaxTapTime has elapsed, trackstick mode is entered. In
this mode, mov- ing the finger slightly in any direction
gives a speed vector that moves the pointer. The
TrackstickSpeed parameter controls the ratio between pointer
speed and finger movement distance. Trackstick mode is
exited when the finger pressure drops below FingerLow or
when the fin- ger is moved further than MaxTapMove away from
the initial position.</p>

<p>Synaptics Area The AreaLeftEdge, AreaRightEdge,
AreaTopEdge and AreaBottomEdge parameters are used to define
the edges of the active area of the touchpad. All movements,
scrolling and tapping which take place outside of this area
will be ignored. This property is disabled by default.</p>

<p>32 bit, 4 values, left, right, top, bottom. 0 disables
an ele- ment.</p>

<p>Synaptics Capabilities This read-only property expresses
the physical capability of the touchpad, most notably
whether the touchpad hardware supports multi-finger tapping
and scrolling.</p>

<p>8 bit (BOOL), 5 values (read-only), has left button, has
middle button, has right button, two-finger detection,
three-finger detection.</p>

<p>Synaptics Pad Resolution 32 bit unsigned, 2 values
(read-only), vertical, horizontal in units/millimeter.</p>

<p>NOTES There is an example hal policy file in
${sourcecode}/fdi/11-x11-synap- tics.fdi which will enable
the driver based on the information if the hardware is
available. Feel free to copy it to /etc/hal/fdi/policy and
customize it to your needs. You can pass custom options to
the driver using x11_options properties. Note that this
requires xorg-server-1.5 or higher.</p>

<p>If either of Protocol &quot;auto-dev&quot; (default) or
Protocol &quot;event&quot; is used, the driver initializes
defaults based on the capabilities reported by the kernel
driver. Acceleration, edges and resolution are based on the
dimensions reported by the kernel. If the kernel reports
multi-finger detection, two-finger vertical scrolling is
enabled, horizontal two- finger scrolling is disabled and
edge scrolling is disabled. If no multi-finger capabilities
are reported, edge scrolling is enabled for both horizontal
and vertical scrolling. Tapping is disabled by default for
touchpads with one or more physical buttons. To enable it
you need to map tap actions to buttons. See the
&quot;TapButton1&quot;, &quot;TapButton2&quot; and
&quot;TapButton3&quot; options.</p>

<p>Button mapping for physical buttons is handled in the
server. If the device is switched to left-handed (an
in-server mapping of physical buttons 1, 2, 3 to the logical
buttons 3, 2, 1, respectively), both physical and TapButtons
are affected. To counteract this, the TapBut- tons need to
be set up in reverse order (TapButton1=3, TapButton2=1).</p>

<p>REMOVED OPTIONS The following options are no longer part
of the driver configuration:</p>

<p>Option &quot;Repeater&quot; &quot;string&quot;</p>

<p>Option &quot;HistorySize&quot; &quot;integer&quot;</p>

<p>Option &quot;SpecialScrollAreaRight&quot;
&quot;boolean&quot;</p>
