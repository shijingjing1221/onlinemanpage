<p>READER.CONF(5) PC/SC Lite READER.CONF(5)</p>

<p>NAME reader.conf - configuration file for pcscd readers
drivers</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The /etc/reader.conf file contains
configuration information for serial and (some) PCMCIA smart
card readers.</p>

<p>USB readers SHALL NOT be configured using this file.
pcscd uses another mechanism to automatically load USB
drivers.</p>

<p>SYNTAX The /etc/reader.conf is a regular text file. Each
reader must be defined by four fields:</p>

<p>FRIENDLYNAME TEXT_STRING DEVICENAME FILENAME LIBPATH
FILENAME CHANNELID NUMBER</p>

<p>The &quot;FRIENDLYNAME&quot; field is an arbitrary text
used to identify the reader. This text is displayed by
commands like pcsc_scan(1) that prints the names of all the
connected and detected readers.</p>

<p>The &quot;DEVICENAME&quot; field was not used for old
drivers (using the IFD han- dler version 2.0 or earlier). It
is now (IFD handler version 3.0) used to identify the
physical port on which the reader is connected. This is the
device name of this port. It is dependent of the OS kernel.
The first serial port device is called /dev/ttyS0 under
Linux and /dev/cuaa0 under FreeBSD.</p>

<p>The &quot;LIBPATH&quot; field is the filename of the
driver code. The driver is a dynamically loaded piece of
code (generally a drivername.so*file).</p>

<p>The &quot;CHANNELID&quot; is no more used for recent
drivers (IFD handler 3.0) and has been superseded by
&quot;DEVICENAME&quot;. If you have an old driver this field
is used to indicate the port to use. You should read your
driver documentation to know what information is needed
here. It should be the serial port number for a serial
reader.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE # Gemplus GemPCTwin reader with serial
communication # connected to the first serial port
FRIENDLYNAME &quot;GemPCTwin serial&quot; DEVICENAME
/dev/ttyS0 LIBPATH
/usr/lib64/pcsc/drivers/serial/libccidtwin.so.0.4.1
CHANNELID 1</p>

<p>DEBUGGING In order to set up your /etc/reader.conf file
correctly you may want to have debug messages from pcscd. I
recommend you to start pscsd in the foreground and debug
mode using: # pcscd --foreground --debug</p>

<p>If everything seems OK you can use the pcsc_scan command
to print the list of correctly detected readers and try to
get the ATR of your smart cards.</p>
