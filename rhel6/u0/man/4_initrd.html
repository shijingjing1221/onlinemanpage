<p>INITRD(4) Linux Programmer s Manual INITRD(4)</p>

<p>NAME initrd - boot loader initialized RAM disk</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION The /dev/initrd is a read-only block
device assigned major number 1 and minor number 250.
Typically /dev/initrd is owned by root.disk with mode 0400
(read access by root only). If the Linux system does not
have /dev/initrd already created, it can be created with the
following commands:</p>

<p>mknod -m 400 /dev/initrd b 1 250 chown root:disk
/dev/initrd</p>

<p>Also, support for both &quot;RAM disk&quot; and
&quot;Initial RAM disk&quot; (e.g. CON- FIG_BLK_DEV_RAM=y
and CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD=y) must be compiled directly into
the Linux kernel to use /dev/initrd. When using /dev/initrd,
the RAM disk driver cannot be loaded as a module.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The special file /dev/initrd is a read-only
block device. This device is a RAM disk that is initialized
(e.g., loaded) by the boot loader before the kernel is
started. The kernel then can use /dev/initrds contents for a
two-phase system boot-up.</p>

<p>In the first boot-up phase, the kernel starts up and
mounts an initial root file-system from the contents of
/dev/initrd (e.g., RAM disk ini- tialized by the boot
loader). In the second phase, additional drivers or other
modules are loaded from the initial root device s contents.
After loading the additional modules, a new root file system
(i.e., the normal root file system) is mounted from a
different device.</p>

<p>Boot-up Operation When booting up with initrd, the
system boots as follows:</p>

<p>1. The boot loader loads the kernel program and
/dev/initrds contents into memory.</p>

<p>2. On kernel startup, the kernel uncompresses and copies
the contents of the device /dev/initrd onto device /dev/ram0
and then frees the memory used by /dev/initrd.</p>

<p>3. The kernel then read-write mounts the device
/dev/ram0 as the ini- tial root file system.</p>

<p>4. If the indicated normal root file system is also the
initial root file-system (e.g. /dev/ram0) then the kernel
skips to the last step for the usual boot sequence.</p>

<p>5. If the executable file /linuxrc is present in the
initial root file- system, /linuxrc is executed with UID 0.
(The file /linuxrc must have executable permission. The file
/linuxrc can be any valid exe- cutable, including a shell
script.)</p>

<p>6. If /linuxrc is not executed or when /linuxrc
terminates, the normal root file system is mounted. (If
/linuxrc exits with any file-sys- tems mounted on the
initial root file-system, then the behavior of the kernel is
UNSPECIFIED. See the NOTES section for the current kernel
behavior.)</p>

<p>7. If the normal root file system has a directory
/initrd, the device /dev/ram0 is moved from / to /initrd.
Otherwise if the directory /initrd does not exist, the
device /dev/ram0 is unmounted. (When moved from / to
/initrd, /dev/ram0 is not unmounted and therefore processes
can remain running from /dev/ram0. If directory /initrd does
not exist on the normal root file system and any processes
remain running from /dev/ram0 when /linuxrc exits, the
behavior of the kernel is UNSPECIFIED. See the NOTES section
for the current kernel behavior.)</p>

<p>8. The usual boot sequence (e.g., invocation of
/sbin/init) is per- formed on the normal root file
system.</p>

<p>Options The following boot loader options, when used
with initrd, affect the kernels boot-up operation:</p>

<p>initrd=filename Specifies the file to load as the
contents of /dev/initrd. For LOADLIN this is a command-line
option. For LILO you have to use this command in the LILO
configuration file /etc/lilo.config. The filename specified
with this option will typically be a gzipped file-system
image.</p>

<p>noinitrd This boot option disables the two-phase boot-up
operation. The kernel performs the usual boot sequence as if
/dev/initrd was not initialized. With this option, any
contents of /dev/initrd loaded into memory by the boot
loader contents are preserved. This option permits the
contents of /dev/initrd to be any data and need not be
limited to a file system image. However, device /dev/initrd
is read-only and can be read only one time after system
startup.</p>

<p>root=device-name Specifies the device to be used as the
normal root file system. For LOADLIN this is a command-line
option. For LILO this is a boot time option or can be used
as an option line in the LILO configuration file
/etc/lilo.config. The device specified by the this option
must be a mountable device having a suitable root
file-system.</p>

<p>Changing the Normal Root File System By default, the
kernels settings (e.g., set in the kernel file with rdev(8)
or compiled into the kernel file), or the boot loader option
setting is used for the normal root file systems. For an
NFS-mounted normal root file system, one has to use the
nfs_root_name and nfs_root_addrs boot options to give the
NFS settings. For more infor- mation on NFS-mounted root see
the kernel documentation file Documenta-
tion/filesystems/nfsroot.txt. For more information on
setting the root file system see also the LILO and LOADLIN
documentation.</p>

<p>It is also possible for the /linuxrc executable to
change the normal root device. For /linuxrc to change the
normal root device, /proc must be mounted. After mounting
/proc, /linuxrc changes the normal root device by writing
into the proc files /proc/sys/kernel/real-root-dev,
/proc/sys/kernel/nfs-root-name, and
/proc/sys/kernel/nfs-root-addrs. For a physical root device,
the root device is changed by having /lin- uxrc write the
new root file system device number into /proc/sys/ker-
nel/real-root-dev. For an NFS root file system, the root
device is changed by having /linuxrc write the NFS setting
into files /proc/sys/kernel/nfs-root-name and
/proc/sys/kernel/nfs-root-addrs and then writing 0xff (e.g.,
the pseudo-NFS-device number) into file
/proc/sys/kernel/real-root-dev. For example, the following
shell com- mand line would change the normal root device to
/dev/hdb1:</p>

<p>echo 0x365 &gt;/proc/sys/kernel/real-root-dev</p>

<p>For an NFS example, the following shell command lines
would change the normal root device to the NFS directory
/var/nfsroot on a local net- worked NFS server with IP
number 193.8.232.7 for a system with IP num- ber 193.8.232.7
and named &quot;idefix&quot;:</p>

<p>echo /var/nfsroot &gt;/proc/sys/kernel/nfs-root-name
echo 193.8.232.2:193.8.232.7::255.255.255.0:idefix
&gt;/proc/sys/kernel/nfs-root-addrs echo 255
&gt;/proc/sys/kernel/real-root-dev</p>

<p>Note: The use of /proc/sys/kernel/real-root-dev to
change the root file system is obsolete. See the kernel
source file Documentation/ini- trd.txt as well as
pivot_root(2) and pivot_root(8) for information on the
modern method of changing the root file system.</p>

<p>Usage The main motivation for implementing initrd was to
allow for modular kernel configuration at system
installation.</p>

<p>A possible system installation scenario is as
follows:</p>

<p>1. The loader program boots from floppy or other media
with a minimal kernel (e.g., support for /dev/ram,
/dev/initrd, and the ext2 file- system) and loads
/dev/initrd with a gzipped version of the initial
file-system.</p>

<p>2. The executable /linuxrc determines what is needed to
(1) mount the normal root file-system (i.e., device type,
device drivers, file system) and (2) the distribution media
(e.g., CD-ROM, network, tape, ...). This can be done by
asking the user, by auto-probing, or by using a hybrid
approach.</p>

<p>3. The executable /linuxrc loads the necessary modules
from the initial root file-system.</p>

<p>4. The executable /linuxrc creates and populates the
root file system. (At this stage the normal root file system
does not have to be a completed system yet.)</p>

<p>5. The executable /linuxrc sets
/proc/sys/kernel/real-root-dev, unmount /proc, the normal
root file system and any other file systems it has mounted,
and then terminates.</p>

<p>6. The kernel then mounts the normal root file
system.</p>

<p>7. Now that the file system is accessible and intact,
the boot loader can be installed.</p>

<p>8. The boot loader is configured to load into
/dev/initrd a file system with the set of modules that was
used to bring up the system. (e.g., Device /dev/ram0 can be
modified, then unmounted, and finally, the image is written
from /dev/ram0 to a file.)</p>

<p>9. The system is now bootable and additional
installation tasks can be performed.</p>

<p>The key role of /dev/initrd in the above is to re-use
the configuration data during normal system operation
without requiring initial kernel selection, a large generic
kernel or, recompiling the kernel.</p>

<p>A second scenario is for installations where Linux runs
on systems with different hardware configurations in a
single administrative network. In such cases, it may be
desirable to use only a small set of kernels (ideally only
one) and to keep the system-specific part of configura- tion
information as small as possible. In this case, create a
common file with all needed modules. Then, only the /linuxrc
file or a file executed by /linuxrc would be different.</p>

<p>A third scenario is more convenient recovery disks.
Because informa- tion like the location of the root
file-system partition is not needed at boot time, the system
loaded from /dev/initrd can use a dialog and/or
auto-detection followed by a possible sanity check.</p>

<p>Last but not least, Linux distributions on CD-ROM may
use initrd for easy installation from the CD-ROM. The
distribution can use LOADLIN to directly load /dev/initrd
from CD-ROM without the need of any floppies. The
distribution could also use a LILO boot floppy and then
bootstrap a bigger ram disk via /dev/initrd from the
CD-ROM.</p>

<p>FILES /dev/initrd /dev/ram0 /linuxrc /initrd</p>

<p>NOTES 1. With the current kernel, any file systems that
remain mounted when /dev/ram0 is moved from / to /initrd
continue to be accessible. However, the /proc/mounts entries
are not updated.</p>

<p>2. With the current kernel, if directory /initrd does
not exist, then /dev/ram0 will not be fully unmounted if
/dev/ram0 is used by any process or has any file-system
mounted on it. If /dev/ram0 is not fully unmounted, then
/dev/ram0 will remain in memory.</p>

<p>3. Users of /dev/initrd should not depend on the
behavior give in the above notes. The behavior may change in
future versions of the Linux kernel.</p>
