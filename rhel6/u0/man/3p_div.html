<p>DIV(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual DIV(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME div - compute the quotient and remainder of an
integer division</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</p>

<p>div_t div(int numer, int denom);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The div() function shall compute the
quotient and remainder of the division of the numerator
numer by the denominator denom. If the divi- sion is
inexact, the resulting quotient is the integer of lesser
magni- tude that is the nearest to the algebraic quotient.
If the result can- not be represented, the behavior is
undefined; otherwise, quot* denom+ rem shall equal
numer.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The div() function shall return a structure
of type div_t, comprising both the quotient and the
remainder. The structure includes the follow- ing members,
in any order:</p>

<p>int quot; /* quotient */ int rem; /* remainder */</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>
