<p>DATE(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual DATE(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME date - write the date and time</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS date [-u] [+format]</p>

<p>date [-u] mmddhhmm[[cc]yy]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The date utility shall write the date and
time to standard output or attempt to set the system date
and time. By default, the current date and time shall be
written. If an operand beginning with+ is speci- fied, the
output format of date shall be controlled by the conversion
specifications and other text in the operand.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The date utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>The following option shall be supported:</p>

<p>-u Perform operations as if the TZ environment variable
was set to the string &quot;UTC0&quot;, or its equivalent
historical value of &quot;GMT0&quot; . Otherwise, date shall
use the timezone indicated by the TZ environment variable or
the system default if that variable is unset or null.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operands shall be supported:</p>

<p>+format When the format is specified, each conversion
specifier shall be replaced in the standard output by its
corresponding value. All other characters shall be copied to
the output without change. The output shall always be
terminated with a &lt;newline&gt;.</p>

<p>Conversion Specifications %a Locales abbreviated weekday
name.</p>

<p>%A Locales full weekday name.</p>

<p>%b Locales abbreviated month name.</p>

<p>%B Locales full month name.</p>

<p>%c Locales appropriate date and time representation.</p>

<p>%C Century (a year divided by 100 and truncated to an
integer) as a decimal number [00,99].</p>

<p>%d Day of the month as a decimal number [01,31].</p>

<p>%D Date in the format mm/dd/yy.</p>

<p>%e Day of the month as a decimal number [1,31] in a
two-digit field with leading space character fill.</p>

<p>%h A synonym for %b .</p>

<p>%j Day of the year as a decimal number [001,366].</p>

<p>%m Month as a decimal number [01,12].</p>

<p>%M Minute as a decimal number [00,59].</p>

<p>%n A &lt;newline&gt;.</p>

<p>%p Locales equivalent of either AM or PM.</p>

<p>%r 12-hour clock time [01,12] using the AM/PM notation;
in the POSIX locale, this shall be equivalent to %I : %M :
%S %p .</p>

<p>%S Seconds as a decimal number [00,60].</p>

<p>%t A &lt;tab&gt;.</p>

<p>%T 24-hour clock time [00,23] in the format
HH:MM:SS.</p>

<p>%u Weekday as a decimal number [1,7] (1=Monday).</p>

<p>%U Week of the year (Sunday as the first day of the
week) as a dec- imal number [00,53]. All days in a new year
preceding the first Sunday shall be considered to be in week
0.</p>

<p>%V Week of the year (Monday as the first day of the
week) as a dec- imal number [01,53]. If the week containing
January 1 has four or more days in the new year, then it
shall be considered week 1; otherwise, it shall be the last
week of the previous year, and the next week shall be week
1.</p>

<p>%w Weekday as a decimal number [0,6] (0=Sunday).</p>

<p>%W Week of the year (Monday as the first day of the
week) as a dec- imal number [00,53]. All days in a new year
preceding the first Monday shall be considered to be in week
0.</p>

<p>%x Locales appropriate date representation.</p>

<p>%X Locales appropriate time representation.</p>

<p>%Y Year with century as a decimal number.</p>

<p>%Z Timezone name, or no characters if no timezone is
determinable.</p>

<p>%% A percent sign character.</p>

<p>See the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,
Section 7.3.5, LC_TIME for the conversion specifier values
in the POSIX locale.</p>

<p>Modified Conversion Specifications Some conversion
specifiers can be modified by the E and O modifier
characters to indicate a different format or specification
as specified in the LC_TIME locale description (see the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 7.3.5,
LC_TIME). If the corresponding keyword (see era, era_year,
era_d_fmt, and alt_digits in the Base Defi- nitions volume
of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 7.3.5, LC_TIME) is not
specified or not supported for the current locale, the
unmodified con- version specifier value shall be used.</p>

<p>%Ec Locale s alternative appropriate date and time
representation.</p>

<p>%EC The name of the base year (period) in the locales
alternative representation.</p>

<p>%Ex Locales alternative date representation.</p>

<p>%EX Locales alternative time representation.</p>

<p>%Ey Offset from %EC (year only) in the locale s
alternative repre- sentation.</p>

<p>%EY Full alternative year representation.</p>

<p>%Od Day of month using the locales alternative numeric
symbols.</p>

<p>%Oe Day of month using the locales alternative numeric
symbols.</p>

<p>%OH Hour (24-hour clock) using the locales alternative
numeric sym- bols.</p>

<p>%OI Hour (12-hour clock) using the locales alternative
numeric sym- bols.</p>

<p>%Om Month using the locale s alternative numeric
symbols.</p>

<p>%OM Minutes using the locale s alternative numeric
symbols.</p>

<p>%OU Week number of the year (Sunday as the first day of
the week) using the locales alternative numeric symbols.</p>

<p>%OV Week number of the year (Monday as the first day of
the week, rules corresponding to %V ), using the locales
alternative numeric symbols.</p>

<p>%Ow Weekday as a number in the locale s alternative
representation (Sunday = 0).</p>

<p>%OW Week number of the year (Monday as the first day of
the week) using the locales alternative numeric symbols.</p>

<p>%Oy Year (offset from %C ) in alternative

<p>mmddhhmm[[cc]yy]</p>

<p>Attempt to set the system date and time from the value
given in the operand. This is only possible if the user has
appropriate privileges and the system permits the setting of
the system date and time. The first mm is the month
(number); dd is the day (number); hh is the hour (number,
24-hour system); the second mm is the minute (number); cc is
the century and is the first two digits of the year (this is
optional); yy is the last two digits of the year and is
optional. If century is not specified, then values in the
range [69,99] shall refer to years 1969 to 1999 inclusive,
and values in the range [00,68] shall refer to years 2000 to
2068 inclusive. The current year is the default if yy is
omitted.</p>

<p>Note: It is expected that in a future version of IEEE
Std 1003.1-2001 the default century inferred from a 2-digit
year will change. (This would apply to all commands
accepting a 2-digit year as input.)</p>

<p>STDIN Not used.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of date:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in
arguments).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>LC_TIME Determine the format and contents of date and
time strings writ- ten by date.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>TZ Determine the timezone in which the time and date are
written, unless the -u option is specified. If the TZ
variable is unset or null and -u is not specified, an
unspecified system default timezone is used.</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT When no formatting operand is specified, the
output in the POSIX locale shall be equivalent to
specifying:</p>

<p>date &quot;+%a %b %e %H:%M:%S %Z %Y&quot;</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 The date was written successfully.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE Conversion specifiers are of
unspecified format when not in the POSIX locale. Some of
them can contain &lt;newline&gt;s in some locales, so it may
be difficult to use the format shown in standard output for
parsing the output of date in those locales.</p>

<p>The range of values for %S extends from 0 to 60 seconds
to accommodate the occasional leap second.</p>

<p>Although certain of the conversion specifiers in the
POSIX locale (such as the name of the month) are shown with
initial capital letters, this need not be the case in other
locales. Programs using these fields may need to adjust the
capitalization if the output is going to be used at the
beginning of a sentence.</p>

<p>The date string formatting capabilities are intended for
use in Grego- rian-style calendars, possibly with a
different starting year (or years). The %x and %c conversion
specifications, however, are intended for local
representation; these may be based on a different,
non-Grego- rian calendar.</p>

<p>The %C conversion specification was introduced to allow
a fallback for the %EC (alternative year format base year);
it can be viewed as the base of the current subdivision in
the Gregorian calendar. The century number is calculated as
the year divided by 100 and truncated to an integer; it
should not be confused with the use of ordinal numbers for
centuries (for example, &quot;twenty-first century&quot;.)
Both the %Ey and %y can then be viewed as the offset from
%EC and %C, respectively.</p>

<p>The E and O modifiers modify the traditional conversion
specifiers, so that they can always be used, even if the
implementation (or the cur- rent locale) does not support
the modifier.</p>

<p>The E modifier supports alternative date formats, such
as the Japanese Emperors Era, as long as these are based on
the Gregorian calendar system. Extending the E modifiers to
other date elements may provide an implementation-defined
extension capable of supporting other calendar systems,
especially in combination with the O modifier.</p>

<p>The O modifier supports time and date formats using the
locales alter- native numerical symbols, such as Kanji or
Hindi digits or ordinal num- ber representation.</p>

<p>Non-European locales, whether they use Latin digits in
computational items or not, often have local forms of the
digits for use in date for- mats. This is not totally
unknown even in Europe; a variant of dates uses Roman
numerals for the months: the third day of September 1991
would be written as 3.IX.1991. In Japan, Kanji digits are
regularly used for dates; in Arabic-speaking countries,
Hindi digits are used. The %d, %e, %H, %I, %m, %S, %U, %w,
%W, and %y conversion specifica- tions always return the
date and time field in Latin digits (that is, 0 to 9). The
%O modifier was introduced to support the use for display
purposes of non-Latin digits. In the LC_TIME category in
localedef, the optional alt_digits keyword is intended for
this purpose. As an exam- ple, assume the following
(partial) localedef source:</p>

<p>alt_digits
&quot;&quot;;&quot;I&quot;;&quot;II&quot;;&quot;III&quot;;&quot;IV&quot;;&quot;V&quot;;&quot;VI&quot;;&quot;VII&quot;;&quot;VIII&quot;
&quot;IX&quot;;&quot;X&quot;;&quot;XI&quot;;&quot;XII&quot;
d_fmt &quot;%e.%Om.%Y&quot;</p>

<p>With the above date, the command:</p>

<p>date &quot;+%x&quot;</p>

<p>would yield 3.IX.1991. With the same d_fmt, but without
the alt_digits, the command would yield 3.9.1991.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES 1. The following are input/output examples of
date used at arbitrary times in the POSIX locale:</p>

<p>$ date Tue Jun 26 09:58:10 PDT 1990</p>

<p>$ date &quot;+DATE: %m/%d/%y%nTIME: %H:%M:%S&quot; DATE:
11/02/91 TIME: 13:36:16</p>

<p>$ date &quot;+TIME: %r&quot; TIME: 01:36:32 PM</p>

<p>2. Examples for Denmark, where the default date and time
format is %a %d %b %Y %T %Z :</p>

<p>$ LANG=da_DK.iso_8859-1 date ons 02 okt 1991 15:03:32
CET</p>

<p>$ LANG=da_DK.iso_8859-1 date &quot;+DATO: %A den %e. %B
%Y%nKLOKKEN: %H:%M:%S&quot; DATO: onsdag den 2. oktober 1991
KLOKKEN: 15:03:56</p>

<p>3. Examples for Germany, where the default date and time
format is %a %d . %h . %Y, %T %Z :</p>

<p>$ LANG=De_DE.88591 date Mi 02.Okt.1991, 15:01:21 MEZ</p>

<p>$ LANG=De_DE.88591 date &quot;+DATUM: %A, %d. %B
%Y%nZEIT: %H:%M:%S&quot; DATUM: Mittwoch, 02. Oktober 1991
ZEIT: 15:02:02</p>

<p>4. Examples for France, where the default date and time
format is %a %d %h %Y %Z %T :</p>

<p>$ LANG=Fr_FR.88591 date Mer 02 oct 1991 MET 15:03:32</p>

<p>$ LANG=Fr_FR.88591 date &quot;+JOUR: %A %d %B %Y%nHEURE:
%H:%M:%S&quot; JOUR: Mercredi 02 octobre 1991 HEURE:
15:03:56</p>

<p>RATIONALE Some of the new options for formatting are
from the ISO C standard. The -u option was introduced to
allow portable access to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
The string &quot;GMT0&quot; is allowed as an equivalent TZ
value to be compatible with all of the systems using the BSD
implemen- tation, where this option originated.</p>

<p>The %e format conversion specification (adopted from
System V) was added because the ISO C standard conversion
specifications did not pro- vide any way to produce the
historical default date output during the first nine days of
any month.</p>

<p>There are two varieties of day and week numbering
supported (in addi- tion to any others created with the
locale-dependent %E and %O modifier characters):</p>

<p>* The historical variety in which Sunday is the first
day of the week and the weekdays preceding the first Sunday
of the year are consid- ered week 0. These are represented
by %w and %U . A variant of this is %W, using Monday as the
first day of the week, but still refer- ring to week 0. This
view of the calendar was retained because so many historical
applications depend on it and the ISO C standard strftime()
function, on which many date implementations are based, was
defined in this way.</p>

<p>* The international standard, based on the ISO 8601:2000
standard where Monday is the first weekday and the algorithm
for the first week number is more complex: If the week
(Monday to Sunday) contain- ing January 1 has four or more
days in the new year, then it is week 1; otherwise, it is
week 53 of the previous year, and the next week is week 1.
These are represented by the new conversion specifica- tions
%u and %V, added as a result of international comments.</p>
