<p>GETPAGESIZE(2) Linux Programmer s Manual
GETPAGESIZE(2)</p>

<p>NAME getpagesize - get memory page size</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>int getpagesize(void);</p>

<p>Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
feature_test_macros(7)):</p>

<p>getpagesize(): _BSD_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;=
500</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The function getpagesize() returns the
number of bytes in a page, where a &quot;page&quot; is the
thing used where it says in the description of mmap(2) that
files are mapped in page-sized units.</p>

<p>The size of the kind of pages that mmap(2) uses, is
found using</p>

<p>#include &lt;unistd.h&gt; long sz =
sysconf(_SC_PAGESIZE);</p>

<p>(most systems allow the synonym _SC_PAGE_SIZE for
_SC_PAGESIZE), or</p>

<p>#include &lt;unistd.h&gt; int sz = getpagesize();</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO SVr4, 4.4BSD, SUSv2. In SUSv2 the
getpagesize() call is labeled LEGACY, and in POSIX.1-2001 it
has been dropped; HP-UX does not have this call. Portable
applications should employ sysconf(_SC_PAGESIZE) instead of
this call.</p>

<p>NOTES Whether getpagesize() is present as a Linux system
call depends on the architecture. If it is, it returns the
kernel symbol PAGE_SIZE, whose value depends on the
architecture and machine model. Generally, one uses binaries
that are dependent on the architecture but not on the
machine model, in order to have a single binary distribution
per archi- tecture. This means that a user program should
not find PAGE_SIZE at compile time from a header file, but
use an actual system call, at least for those architectures
(like sun4) where this dependency exists. Here libc4, libc5,
glibc 2.0 fail because their getpagesize() returns a
statically derived value, and does not use a system call.
Things are OK in glibc 2.1.</p>
