<p>NAME wpa_priv - wpa_supplicant privilege separation
helper</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS wpa_priv [ -c ctrl path ] [ -Bdd ] [ -P pid
file ] [ driver:ifname [driver:ifname ...] ]</p>

<p>OVERVIEW wpa_priv is a privilege separation helper that
minimizes the size of wpa_supplicant code that needs to be
run with root privileges.</p>

<p>If enabled, privileged operations are done in the
wpa_priv process while leaving rest of the code (e.g., EAP
authentication and WPA hand- shakes) to operate in an
unprivileged process (wpa_supplicant) that can be run as
non-root user. Privilege separation restricts the effects of
potential software errors by containing the majority of the
code in an unprivileged process to avoid the possibility of
a full system compro- mise.</p>

<p>wpa_priv needs to be run with network admin privileges
(usually, root user). It opens a UNIX domain socket for each
interface that is included on the command line; any other
interface will be off limits for wpa_supplicant in this kind
of configuration. After this, wpa_sup- plicant can be run as
a non-root user (e.g., all standard users on a laptop or as
a special non-privileged user account created just for this
purpose to limit access to user files even further).</p>

<p>EXAMPLE CONFIGURATION The following steps are an example
of how to configure wpa_priv to allow users in the wpapriv
group to communicate with wpa_supplicant with privilege
separation:</p>

<p>Create user group (e.g., wpapriv) and assign users that
should be able to use wpa_supplicant into that group.</p>

<p>Create /var/run/wpa_priv directory for UNIX domain
sockets and control user access by setting it accessible
only for the wpapriv group:</p>

<p>mkdir /var/run/wpa_priv chown root:wpapriv
/var/run/wpa_priv chmod 0750 /var/run/wpa_priv</p>

<p>Start wpa_priv as root (e.g., from system startup
scripts) with the enabled interfaces configured on the
command line:</p>

<p>wpa_priv -B -c /var/run/wpa_priv -P
/var/run/wpa_priv.pid wext:wlan0</p>

<p>Run wpa_supplicant as non-root with a user that is in
the wpapriv group:</p>

<p>wpa_supplicant -i ath0 -c wpa_supplicant.conf</p>

<p>COMMAND ARGUMENTS -c ctrl path Specify the path to
wpa_priv control directory (Default:
/var/run/wpa_priv/).</p>

<p>-B Run as a daemon in the background.</p>

<p>-P file Set the location of the PID file.</p>

<p>driver:ifname [driver:ifname ...] The &lt;driver&gt;
string dictates which of the supported wpa_suppli- cant
driver backends is to be used. To get a list of supported
driver types see wpa_supplicant help (e.g, wpa_supplicant
-h). The driver backend supported by most good drivers is
wext.</p>

<p>The &lt;ifname&gt; string specifies which network
interface is to be managed by wpa_supplicant (e.g., wlan0 or
ath0).</p>

<p>wpa_priv does not use the network interface before
wpa_suppli- cant is started, so it is fine to include
network interfaces that are not available at the time
wpa_priv is started. wpa_priv can control multiple
interfaces with one process, but it is also possible to run
multiple wpa_priv processes at the same time, if
desired.</p>
