<p>NAME XmContainerCut Container widget function to move
items to the clip- board</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;Xm/Container.h&gt; Boolean
XmContainerCut( Widget container, Time timestamp);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION XmContainerCut cuts the primary selected
items to the clipboard. This routine calls the
XmNconvertCallback procedures, possibly multiple times, with
the selection member of the XmConvertCallbackStruct set to
CLIPBOARD and with the parm member set to XmMOVE. If the
transfer is successful, this routine then calls the
XmNconvertCallback procedures for the CLIPBOARD selection
and the DELETE target.</p>

<p>container Specifies the Container widget ID.</p>

<p>timestamp Specifies the server time at which to modify
the selection value.</p>

<p>For a complete definition of Container and its
associated resources, see XmContainer(3).</p>

<p>RETURN The function returns False in the following
cases: if the primary selection is NULL, if the widget does
not own the primary selection, or if the function is unable
to gain ownership of the clipboard selection. Otherwise, it
returns True.</p>
