<p>LIMITS.CONF(5) Linux-PAM Manual LIMITS.CONF(5)</p>

<p>NAME limits.conf - configuration file for the pam_limits
module</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The syntax of the lines is as follows:</p>

<p>&lt;domain&gt; &lt;type&gt; &lt;item&gt;
&lt;value&gt;</p>

<p>The fields listed above should be filled as follows:</p>

<p>&lt;domain&gt;</p>

<p>&middot; a username</p>

<p>&middot; a groupname, with @group syntax. This should
not be confused with netgroups.</p>

<p>&middot; the wildcard *, for default entry.</p>

<p>&middot; the wildcard %, for maxlogins limit only, can
also be used with %group syntax.</p>

<p>&lt;type&gt;</p>

<p>hard for enforcing hard resource limits. These limits
are set by the superuser and enforced by the Kernel. The
user cannot raise his requirement of system resources above
such values.</p>

<p>soft for enforcing soft resource limits. These limits
are ones that the user can move up or down within the
permitted range by any pre-existing hard limits. The values
specified with this token can be thought of as default
values, for normal system usage.</p>

<p>- for enforcing both soft and hard resource limits
together.</p>

<p>Note, if you specify a type of &acute;-&acute; but
neglect to supply the item and value fields then the module
will never enforce any limits on the specified user/group
etc. .</p>

<p>&lt;item&gt;</p>

<p>core limits the core file size (KB)</p>

<p>data maximum data size (KB)</p>

<p>fsize maximum filesize (KB)</p>

<p>memlock maximum locked-in-memory address space (KB)</p>

<p>nofile maximum number of open files</p>

<p>rss maximum resident set size (KB) (Ignored in Linux
2.4.30 and higher)</p>

<p>stack maximum stack size (KB)</p>

<p>cpu maximum CPU time (minutes)</p>

<p>nproc maximum number of processes</p>

<p>as address space limit (KB)</p>

<p>maxlogins maximum number of logins for this user except
for this with uid=0</p>

<p>maxsyslogins maximum number of logins on system</p>

<p>priority the priority to run user process with (negative
values boost process priority)</p>

<p>locks maximum locked files (Linux 2.4 and higher)</p>

<p>sigpending maximum number of pending signals (Linux 2.6
and higher)</p>

<p>msqqueue maximum memory used by POSIX message queues
(bytes) (Linux 2.6 and higher)</p>

<p>nice maximum nice priority allowed to raise to (Linux
2.6.12 and higher) values: [-20,19]</p>

<p>rtprio maximum realtime priority allowed for
non-privileged processes (Linux 2.6.12 and higher)</p>

<p>All items support the values -1, unlimited or infinity
indicating no limit, except for priority and nice.</p>

<p>If a hard limit or soft limit of a resource is set to a
valid value, but outside of the supported range of the local
system, the system may reject the new limit or unexpected
behavior may occur. If the control value required is used,
the module will reject the login if a limit could not be
set.</p>

<p>In general, individual limits have priority over group
limits, so if you impose no limits for admin group, but one
of the members in this group have a limits line, the user
will have its limits set according to this line.</p>

<p>Also, please note that all limit settings are set per
login. They are not global, nor are they permanent; existing
only for the duration of the session.</p>

<p>In the limits configuration file, the &acute;#&acute;
character introduces a comment - after which the rest of the
line is ignored.</p>

<p>The pam_limits module does report configuration problems
found in its configuration file and errors via
syslog(3).</p>

<p>EXAMPLES These are some example lines which might be
specified in /etc/security/limits.conf.</p>

<p>* soft core 0 * hard rss 10000 @student hard nproc 20
@faculty soft nproc 20 @faculty hard nproc 50 ftp hard nproc
0 @student - maxlogins 4</p>
