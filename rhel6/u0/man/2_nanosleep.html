<p>NANOSLEEP(2) Linux Programmer s Manual NANOSLEEP(2)</p>

<p>NAME nanosleep - high-resolution sleep</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;time.h&gt;</p>

<p>int nanosleep(const struct timespec *req, struct
timespec *rem);</p>

<p>Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
feature_test_macros(7)):</p>

<p>nanosleep(): _POSIX_C_SOURCE &gt;= 199309L</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION nanosleep() suspends the execution of the
calling thread until either at least the time specified in
*req has elapsed, or the delivery of a signal that triggers
the invocation of a handler in the calling thread or that
terminates the process.</p>

<p>If the call is interrupted by a signal handler,
nanosleep() returns -1, sets errno to EINTR, and writes the
remaining time into the structure pointed to by rem unless
rem is NULL. The value of *rem can then be used to call
nanosleep() again and complete the specified pause (but see
NOTES).</p>

<p>The structure timespec is used to specify intervals of
time with nanosecond precision. It is defined as
follows:</p>

<p>struct timespec { time_t tv_sec; /* seconds */ long
tv_nsec; /* nanoseconds */ };</p>

<p>The value of the nanoseconds field must be in the range
0 to 999999999.</p>

<p>Compared to sleep(3) and usleep(3), nanosleep() has the
following advantages: it provides a higher resolution for
specifying the sleep interval; POSIX.1 explicitly specifies
that it does not interact with signals; and it makes the
task of resuming a sleep that has been inter- rupted by a
signal handler easier.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On successfully sleeping for the requested
interval, nanosleep() returns 0. If the call is interrupted
by a signal handler or encoun- ters an error, then it
returns -1, with errno set to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS EFAULT Problem with copying information from user
space.</p>

<p>EINTR The pause has been interrupted by a non-blocked
signal that was delivered to the thread. The remaining sleep
time has been written into *rem so that the thread can
easily call nanosleep() again and continue with the
pause.</p>

<p>EINVAL The value in the tv_nsec field was not in the
range 0 to 999999999 or tv_sec was negative.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>NOTES If the interval specified in req is not an exact
multiple of the granu- larity underlying clock (see
time(7)), then the interval will be rounded up to the next
multiple. Furthermore, after the sleep com- pletes, there
may still be a delay before the CPU becomes free to once
again execute the calling thread.</p>

<p>The fact that nanosleep() sleeps for a relative interval
can be prob- lematic if the call is repeatedly restarted
after being interrupted by signals, since the time between
the interruptions and restarts of the call will lead to
drift in the time when the sleep finally completes. This
problem can be avoided by using clock_nanosleep(2) with an
abso- lute time value.</p>

<p>POSIX.1 specifies that nanosleep() should measure time
against the CLOCK_REALTIME clock. However, Linux measures
the time using the CLOCK_MONOTONIC clock. This probably does
not matter, since the POSIX.1 specification for
clock_settime() says that discontinuous changes in
CLOCK_REALTIME should not affect nanosleep():</p>

<p>Setting the value of the CLOCK_REALTIME clock via
clock_set- time() shall have no effect on threads that are
blocked waiting for a relative time service based upon this
clock, including the nanosleep() function; ... Consequently,
these time services shall expire when the requested relative
interval elapses, inde- pendently of the new or old value of
the clock.</p>

<p>Old behavior In order to support applications requiring
much more precise pauses (e.g., in order to control some
time-critical hardware), nanosleep() would handle pauses of
up to 2 ms by busy waiting with microsecond pre- cision when
called from a thread scheduled under a real-time policy like
SCHED_FIFO or SCHED_RR. This special extension was removed
in kernel 2.5.39, hence is still present in current 2.4
kernels, but not in 2.6 kernels.</p>

<p>BUGS In Linux 2.4, if nanosleep() is stopped by a signal
(e.g., SIGTSTP), then the call fails with the error EINTR
after the thread is resumed by a SIGCONT signal. If the
system call is subsequently restarted, then the time that
the thread spent in the stopped state is not counted against
the sleep interval.</p>
