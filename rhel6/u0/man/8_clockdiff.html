CLOCKDIFF(8)</p>

<p>NAME clockdiff - measure clock difference between
hosts</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS clockdiff [ -o] [ -o1] destination</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION clockdiff Measures clock difference between
us and destination with 1 msec resolution using ICMP
TIMESTAMP [2] packets or, optionally, IP TIMESTAMP option
[3] option added to ICMP ECHO. [1]</p>

<p>OPTIONS -o Use IP TIMESTAMP with ICMP ECHO instead of
ICMP TIMESTAMP mes- sages. It is useful with some
destinations, which do not support ICMP TIMESTAMP (f.e.
Solaris &lt;2.4).</p>

<p>-o1 Slightly different form of -o, namely it uses
three-term IP TIMESTAMP with prespecified hop addresses
instead of four term one. What flavor works better depends
on target host. Particu- larly, -o is better for Linux.</p>

<p>WARNINGS &middot; Some nodes (Cisco) use non-standard
timestamps, which is allowed by RFC, but makes timestamps
mostly useless.</p>

<p>&middot; Some nodes generate messed timestamps
(Solaris&gt;2.4), when run xntpd. Seems, its IP stack uses a
corrupted clock source, which is synchro- nized to
time-of-day clock periodically and jumps randomly making
timestamps mostly useless. Good news is that you can use NTP
in this case, which is even better.</p>

<p>&middot; clockdiff shows difference in time modulo 24
days.</p>

<p>AUTHOR clockdiff was compiled by Alexey Kuznetsov
&lt;kuznet@ms2.inr.ac.ru&gt;. It was based on code borrowed
from BSD timed daemon. It is now maintained by YOSHIFUJI
Hideaki &lt;yoshfuji@skbuff.net&gt;.</p>

<p>SECURITY clockdiff requires CAP_NET_RAWIO capability to
be executed. It is safe to be used as set-uid root.</p>

<p>AVAILABILITY clockdiff is part of iputils package and
the latest versions are available in source form at
http://www.skbuff.net/iputils/iputils-cur- rent.tar.bz2.</p>
