<p>FUNCTION::CTIME(3stap) Time string utility function
FUNCTION::CTIME(3stap)</p>

<p>NAME function::ctime - Convert seconds since epoch into
human readable date/time string.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ctime:string(epochsecs:long)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS epochsecs Number of seconds since epoch (as
returned by gettimeofday_s).</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Takes an argument of seconds since the epoch
as returned by gettimeofday_s. Returns a string of the
form</p>

<p>Wed Jun 30 21:49:08 1993</p>

<p>The string will always be exactly 24 characters. If the
time would be unreasonable far in the past (before what can
be represented with a 32 bit offset in seconds from the
epoch) the returned string will be a long, long time ago....
If the time would be unreasonable far in the future the
returned string will be far far in the future... (both these
strings are also 24 characters wide).</p>

<p>Note that the epoch (zero) corresponds to</p>

<p>Thu Jan 1 00:00:00 1970</p>

<p>The earliest full date given by ctime, corresponding to
epochsecs -2147483648 is Fri Dec 13 20:45:52 1901. The
latest full date given by ctime, corresponding to epochsecs
2147483647 is Tue Jan 19 03:14:07 2038.</p>

<p>The abbreviations for the days of the week are Sun, Mon,
Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, and Sat. The abbreviations for the
months are Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct,
Nov, and Dec.</p>

<p>Note that the real C library ctime function puts a
newline (&acute;0&acute;) character at the end of the string
that this function does not. Also note that since the kernel
has no concept of timezones, the returned time is always in
GMT.</p>
