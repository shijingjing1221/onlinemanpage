<p>SDL_SysWMEvent(3) SDL API Reference
SDL_SysWMEvent(3)</p>

<p>NAME SDL_SysWMEvent - Platform-dependent window manager
event.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The system window manager event contains a
pointer to system-specific information about unknown window
manager events. If you enable this event using
SDL_EventState(), it will be generated whenever unhandled
events are received from the window manager. This can be
used, for example, to implement cut-and-paste in your
application.</p>

<p>typedef struct { Uint8 type; /* Always SDL_SysWM */ }
SDL_SysWMEvent;</p>

<p>If you want to obtain system-specific information about
the window manager, you can fill the version member of a
SDL_SysWMinfo structure (details can be found in
SDL_syswm.h, which must be included) using the SDL_VERSION()
macro found in SDL_version.h, and pass it to the func-
tion:</p>

<p>int SDL_GetWMInfo(SDL_SysWMinfo *info);</p>

<p>SEE ALSO SDL_EventState</p>
