<p>VIRT-LIST-PARTITIONS(1) Virtualization Support
VIRT-LIST-PARTITIONS(1)</p>

<p>NAME virt-list-partitions - List partitions in a virtual
machine or disk image</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS virt-list-partitions [--options] domname</p>

<p>virt-list-partitions [--options] disk.img [disk.img
...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION &quot;virt-list-partitions&quot; is a
command line tool to list the partitions that are contained
in a virtual machine or disk image. It is mainly useful as a
first step to using virt-resize(1).</p>

<p>&quot;virt-list-partitions&quot; is just a simple
wrapper around libguestfs(3) functionality. For more complex
cases you should look at the guestfish(1) tool.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --help Display brief help.</p>

<p>--version Display version number and exit.</p>

<p>--connect URI | -c URI If using libvirt, connect to the
given URI. If omitted, then we connect to the default
libvirt hypervisor.</p>

<p>If you specify guest block devices directly, then
libvirt is not used at all.</p>

<p>-l | --long With this option,
&quot;virt-list-partitions&quot; displays the type and size
of each partition too (where &quot;type&quot; means
&quot;ext3&quot;, &quot;pv&quot; etc.)</p>

<p>-h | --human-readable Show sizes in human-readable form
(eg. &quot;1G&quot;).</p>
