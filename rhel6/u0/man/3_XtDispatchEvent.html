<p>XtAppNextEvent(3) XT FUNCTIONS XtAppNextEvent(3)</p>

<p>NAME XtAppNextEvent, XtAppPending, XtAppPeekEvent,
XtAppProcessEvent, Xt- DispatchEvent, XtAppMainLoop - query
and process events and input</p>

<p>SYNTAX void XtAppNextEvent(XtAppContext app_context,
XEvent *event_return);</p>

<p>Boolean XtAppPeekEvent(XtAppContext app_context, XEvent
*event_return);</p>

<p>XtInputMask XtAppPending(XtAppContext app_context);</p>

<p>void XtAppProcessEvent(XtAppContext app_context,
XtInputMask mask);</p>

<p>Boolean XtDispatchEvent(XEvent *event);</p>

<p>void XtAppMainLoop(XtAppContext app_context);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS app_context Specifies the application context
that identifies the appli- cation .</p>

<p>event Specifies a pointer to the event structure that is
to be dis- patched to the appropriate event handler.</p>

<p>event_return Returns the event information to the
specified event struc- ture.</p>

<p>mask Specifies what types of events to process. The mask
is the bitwise inclusive OR of any combination of
XtIMXEvent, XtIM- Timer, XtIMAlternateInput, and XtIMSignal.
As a convenience, the X Toolkit defines the symbolic name
XtIMAll to be the bitwise inclusive OR of all event
types.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION If the X event queue is empty,
XtAppNextEvent flushes the X output buffers of each Display
in the application context and waits for an event while
looking at the other input sources, timeout timeout values,
and signal handlers and calling any callback procedures
triggered by them. This wait time can be used for background
processing (see Sec- tion 7.8).</p>

<p>If there is an event in the queue, XtAppPeekEvent fills
in the event and returns a nonzero value. If no X input is
on the queue, XtAppPeek- Event flushes the output buffer and
blocks until input is available (possibly calling some
timeout callbacks in the process). If the input is an event,
XtAppPeekEvent fills in the event and returns a nonzero
value. Otherwise, the input is for an alternate input
source, and XtAppPeekEvent returns zero.</p>

<p>The XtAppPending function returns a nonzero value if
there are events pending from the X server, timer pending,
or other input sources pend- ing. The value returned is a
bit mask that is the OR of XtIMXEvent, XtIMTimer,
XtIMAlternateInput, and XtIMSignal (see XtAppProcessEvent).
If there are no events pending, XtAppPending flushes the
output buffer and returns zero.</p>

<p>The XtAppProcessEvent function processes one timer,
alternate input, signal source, or X event. If there is
nothing of the appropriate type to process,
XtAppProcessEvent blocks until there is. If there is more
than one type of thing available to process, it is undefined
which will get processed. Usually, this procedure is not
called by client appli- cations (see XtAppMainLoop).
XtAppProcessEvent processes timer events by calling any
appropriate timer callbacks, alternate input by calling any
appropriate alternate input callbacks, signal source by
calling any appropriate signal callbacks, and X events by
calling XtDispatchEvent.</p>

<p>When an X event is received, it is passed to
XtDispatchEvent, which calls the appropriate event handlers
and passes them the widget, the event, and client-specific
data registered with each procedure. If there are no
handlers for that event registered, the event is ignored and
the dispatcher simply returns. The order in which the
handlers are called is undefined.</p>

<p>The XtDispatchEvent function sends those events to the
event handler functions that have been previously registered
with the dispatch rou- tine. XtDispatchEvent returns True if
it dispatched the event to some handler and False if it
found no handler to dispatch the event to. The most common
use of XtDispatchEvent is to dispatch events acquired with
the XtAppNextEvent procedure. However, it also can be used
to dispatch user-constructed events. XtDispatchEvent also is
responsible for implementing the grab semantics for
XtAddGrab.</p>

<p>The XtAppMainLoop function first reads the next incoming
X event by calling XtAppNextEvent and then it dispatches the
event to the appro- priate registered procedure by calling
XtDispatchEvent. This consti- tutes the main loop of X
Toolkit applications, and, as such, it does not return
unless XtAppSetExitFlag is called. Applications are expected
to exit in response to some user action. There is nothing
special about XtAppMainLoop; it is simply an loop that calls
XtAppNext- Event and then XtDispatchEvent, until
XtAppGetExitFlag() returns true.</p>

<p>Applications can provide their own version of this loop,
which tests some global termination flag or tests that the
number of top-level wid- gets is larger than zero before
circling back to the call to XtAppNext- Event.</p>
