<p>NAME nmblookup - NetBIOS over TCP/IP client used to
lookup NetBIOS names</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS nmblookup [-M] [-R] [-S] [-r] [-A] [-h] [-B
&lt;broadcast address&gt;] [-U &lt;unicast address&gt;] [-d
&lt;debug level&gt;] [-s &lt;smb config file&gt;] [-i
&lt;NetBIOS scope&gt;] [-T] [-f] {name}</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This tool is part of the samba(7) suite.</p>

<p>nmblookup is used to query NetBIOS names and map them to
IP addresses in a network using NetBIOS over TCP/IP queries.
The options allow the name queries to be directed at a
particular IP broadcast area or to a particular machine. All
queries are done over UDP.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -M Searches for a master browser by looking up
the NetBIOS name name with a type of 0x1d. If name is
&quot;-&quot; then it does a lookup on the special name
__MSBROWSE__. Please note that in order to use the name
&quot;-&quot;, you need to make sure &quot;-&quot;
isn&acute;t parsed as an argument, e.g. use : nmblookup -M
-- -.</p>

<p>-R Set the recursion desired bit in the packet to do a
recursive lookup. This is used when sending a name query to
a machine running a WINS server and the user wishes to query
the names in the WINS server. If this bit is unset the
normal (broadcast responding) NetBIOS processing code on a
machine is used instead. See RFC1001, RFC1002 for
details.</p>

<p>-S Once the name query has returned an IP address then
do a node status query as well. A node status query returns
the NetBIOS names registered by a host.</p>

<p>-r Try and bind to UDP port 137 to send and receive UDP
datagrams. The reason for this option is a bug in Windows 95
where it ignores the source port of the requesting packet
and only replies to UDP port 137. Unfortunately, on most
UNIX systems root privilege is needed to bind to this port,
and in addition, if the nmbd(8) daemon is running on this
machine it also binds to this port.</p>

<p>-A Interpret name as an IP Address and do a node status
query on this address.</p>

<p>-n|--netbiosname &lt;primary NetBIOS name&gt; This
option allows you to override the NetBIOS name that Samba
uses for itself. This is identical to setting the
smb.conf.5.html# parameter in the smb.conf file. However, a
command line setting will take precedence over settings in
smb.conf.</p>

<p>-i|--scope &lt;scope&gt; This specifies a NetBIOS scope
that nmblookup will use to communicate with when generating
NetBIOS names. For details on the use of NetBIOS scopes, see
rfc1001.txt and rfc1002.txt. NetBIOS scopes are very rarely
used, only set this parameter if you are the system
administrator in charge of all the NetBIOS systems you
communicate with.</p>

<p>-W|--workgroup=domain Set the SMB domain of the
username. This overrides the default domain which is the
domain defined in smb.conf. If the domain specified is the
same as the servers NetBIOS name, it causes the client to
log on using the servers local SAM (as opposed to the Domain
SAM).</p>

<p>-O|--socket-options socket options TCP socket options to
set on the client socket. See the socket options parameter
in the smb.conf manual page for the list of valid
options.</p>

<p>-h|--help Print a summary of command line options.</p>

<p>-B &lt;broadcast address&gt; Send the query to the given
broadcast address. Without this option the default behavior
of nmblookup is to send the query to the broadcast address
of the network interfaces as either auto-detected or defined
in the interfaces parameter of the smb.conf(5) file.</p>

<p>-U &lt;unicast address&gt; Do a unicast query to the
specified address or host unicast address. This option
(along with the -R option) is needed to query a WINS
server.</p>

<p>-d|--debuglevel=level level is an integer from 0 to 10.
The default value if this parameter is not specified is
0.</p>

<p>The higher this value, the more detail will be logged to
the log files about the activities of the server. At level
0, only critical errors and serious warnings will be logged.
Level 1 is a reasonable level for day-to-day running - it
generates a small amount of information about operations
carried out.</p>

<p>Levels above 1 will generate considerable amounts of log
data, and should only be used when investigating a problem.
Levels above 3 are designed for use only by developers and
generate HUGE amounts of log data, most of which is
extremely cryptic.</p>

<p>Note that specifying this parameter here will override
the smb.conf.5.html# parameter in the smb.conf file.</p>

<p>-V|--version Prints the program version number.</p>

<p>-s|--configfile &lt;configuration file&gt; The file
specified contains the configuration details required by the
server. The information in this file includes
server-specific information such as what printcap file to
use, as well as descriptions of all the services that the
server is to provide. See smb.conf for more information. The
default configuration file name is determined at compile
time.</p>

<p>-l|--log-basename=logdirectory Base directory name for
log/debug files. The extension &quot;.progname&quot; will be
appended (e.g. log.smbclient, log.smbd, etc...). The log
file is never removed by the client.</p>

<p>-T This causes any IP addresses found in the lookup to
be looked up via a reverse DNS lookup into a DNS name, and
printed out before each</p>

<p>IP address .... NetBIOS name</p>

<p>pair that is the normal output.</p>

<p>-f Show which flags apply to the name that has been
looked up. Possible answers are zero or more of: Response,
Authoritative, Truncated, Recursion_Desired,
Recursion_Available, Broadcast.</p>

<p>name This is the NetBIOS name being queried. Depending
upon the previous options this may be a NetBIOS name or IP
address. If a NetBIOS name then the different name types may
be specified by appending &acute;#&lt;type&gt;&acute; to the
name. This name may also be &acute;*&acute;, which will
return all registered names within a broadcast area.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES nmblookup can be used to query a WINS server
(in the same way nslookup is used to query DNS servers). To
query a WINS server, nmblookup must be called like this:</p>

<p>nmblookup -U server -R &acute;name&acute;</p>

<p>For example, running :</p>

<p>nmblookup -U samba.org -R &acute;IRIX#1B&acute;</p>

<p>would query the WINS server samba.org for the domain
master browser (1B name type) for the IRIX workgroup.</p>

<p>VERSION This man page is correct for version 3 of the
Samba suite.</p>

<p>AUTHOR The original Samba software and related utilities
were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by
the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way
the Linux kernel is developed.</p>

<p>The original Samba man pages were written by Karl Auer.
The man page sources were converted to YODL format (another
excellent piece of Open Source software, available at
ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/) and updated for the Samba
2.0 release by Jeremy Allison. The conversion to DocBook for
Samba 2.2 was done by Gerald Carter. The conversion to
DocBook XML 4.2 for Samba 3.0 was done by Alexander
Bokovoy.</p>
