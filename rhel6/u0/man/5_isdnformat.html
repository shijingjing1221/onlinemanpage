<p>NAME isdnformat - common isdn config file format</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This man page describes the format of all
isdn config files.</p>

<p>FORMAT Empty lines are ignored.</p>

<p>If a # is encountered, this character and the rest of
the line is ignored (its considered a comment). You can
prepend a backslash to prevent this and use the #
character.</p>

<p>If the last character of a line is a backslash the next
line is a continuation of the current line.</p>

<p>The file format is like smb.conf or win.ini: there are
sections and entries within the section. However, the syntax
was expanded with sub- sections; these can be nested as
often as you like.</p>

<p>All whitespace (space and tabs) at the end of the line
are ignored.</p>

<p>Section and entry names are case insensitive.</p>

<p>Values are case sensitive, of course (the case is
preserved).</p>

<p>Section and entry names may not use the characters
&quot;*?|&amp;/&quot;; if one of these is encountered, it is
ignored.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the line you may use as much
whitespace as you like.</p>

<p>A section has the format &quot;[&quot; NAME
&quot;]&quot;. You may use whitespace between the braces and
the name, or none at all.</p>

<p>An entry has the format ENTRY &quot;=&quot; VALUE. You
may use whitespace before and after the equal sign, or none
at all.</p>

<p>A subsection starts with ENTRY &quot;=&quot;
&quot;{&quot; and ends with &quot;}&quot;. You may use
sections, entries and subsections between the start and the
end tag.</p>

<p>Beware: unlike samba or windows the semicolon is not
used for comments !</p>

<p>You can use INCLUDE(File) to include a file. If the
filename is not absolute, its considered relative to the
directory of the including document. You may use it anywhere
in a file, but there may be no space characters in the
file!</p>

<p>All subsections started in an include file must end in
that include file, so the number of opened and closed
brackets must match.</p>

<p>Beware: recursive including will cause the program to
break. The library does not prevent this.</p>
