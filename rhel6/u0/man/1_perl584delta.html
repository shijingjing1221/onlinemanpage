<p>PERL584DELTA(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERL584DELTA(1)</p>

<p>NAME perl584delta - what is new for perl v5.8.4</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This document describes differences between
the 5.8.3 release and the 5.8.4 release.</p>

<p>Incompatible Changes Many minor bugs have been fixed.
Scripts which happen to rely on previously erroneous
behaviour will consider these fixes as incompatible changes
:-) You are advised to perform sufficient acceptance testing
on this release to satisfy yourself that this does not
affect you, before putting this release into production.</p>

<p>The diagnostic output of Carp has been changed slightly,
to add a space after the comma between arguments. This makes
it much easier for tools such as web browsers to wrap it,
but might confuse any automatic tools which perform detailed
parsing of Carp output.</p>

<p>The internal dump output has been improved, so that
non-printable characters such as newline and backspace are
output in &quot;otation, rather than octal. This might just
confuse non-robust tools which parse the output of modules
such as Devel::Peek.</p>

<p>Core Enhancements Malloc wrapping Perl can now be built
to detect attempts to assign pathologically large chunks of
memory. Previously such assignments would suffer from
integer wrap-around during size calculations causing a
misallocation, which would crash perl, and could
theoretically be used for &quot;stack smashing&quot;
attacks. The wrapping defaults to enabled on platforms where
we know it works (most AIX configurations, BSDi, Darwin, DEC
OSF/1, FreeBSD, HP/UX, GNU Linux, OpenBSD, Solaris, VMS and
most Win32 compilers) and defaults to disabled on other
platforms.</p>

<p>Unicode Character Database 4.0.1 The copy of the Unicode
Character Database included in Perl 5.8 has been updated to
4.0.1 from 4.0.0.</p>

<p>suidperl less insecure Paul Szabo has analysed and
patched &quot;suidperl&quot; to remove existing known
insecurities. Currently there are no known holes in
&quot;suidperl&quot;, but previous experience shows that we
cannot be confident that these were the last. You may no
longer invoke the set uid perl directly, so to preserve
backwards compatibility with scripts that invoke
#!/usr/bin/suidperl the only set uid binary is now
&quot;sperl5.8.&quot;n (&quot;sperl5.8.4&quot; for this
release). &quot;suidperl&quot; is installed as a hard link
to &quot;perl&quot;; both &quot;suidperl&quot; and
&quot;perl&quot; will invoke &quot;sperl5.8.4&quot;
automatically the set uid binary, so this change should be
completely transparent.</p>

<p>For new projects the core perl team would strongly
recommend that you use dedicated, single purpose security
tools such as &quot;sudo&quot; in preference to
&quot;suidperl&quot;.</p>

<p>format In addition to bug fixes, &quot;format&quot; s
features have been enhanced. See perlform</p>

<p>Modules and Pragmata The (mis)use of &quot;/tmp&quot; in
core modules and documentation has been tidied up. Some
modules available both within the perl core and
independently from CPAN (&quot;dual-life modules&quot;) have
not yet had these changes applied; the changes will be
integrated into future stable perl releases as the modules
are updated on CPAN.</p>

<p>Updated modules Attribute::Handlers B Benchmark CGI Carp
Cwd Exporter File::Find IO IPC::Open3 Local::Maketext
Math::BigFloat Math::BigInt Math::BigRat MIME::Base64
ODBM_File POSIX Shell Socket There is experimental support
for Linux abstract Unix domain sockets.</p>

<p>Storable Switch Synced with its CPAN version 2.10</p>

<p>Sys::Syslog &quot;syslog()&quot; can now use numeric
constants for facility names and priorities, in addition to
strings.</p>

<p>Term::ANSIColor Time::HiRes Unicode::UCD Win32
Win32.pm/Win32.xs has moved from the libwin32 module to core
Perl</p>

<p>base open threads Detached threads are now also
supported on Windows.</p>

<p>utf8</p>

<p>Performance Enhancements &middot; Accelerated Unicode
case mappings (&quot;/i&quot;, &quot;lc&quot;,
&quot;uc&quot;, etc).</p>

<p>&middot; In place sort optimised (eg &quot;@a = sort
@a&quot;)</p>

<p>&middot; Unnecessary assignment optimised away in</p>

<p>my $s = undef; my @a = (); my %h = ();</p>

<p>&middot; Optimised &quot;map&quot; in scalar context</p>

<p>Utility Changes The Perl debugger (lib/perl5db.pl) can
now save all debugger commands for sourcing later, and can
display the parent inheritance tree of a given class.</p>

<p>Installation and Configuration Improvements The build
process on both VMS and Windows has had several minor
improvements made. On Windows Borlands C compiler can now
compile perl with PerlIO and/or USE_LARGE_FILES enabled.</p>

<p>&quot;perl.exe&quot; on Windows now has a
&quot;Camel&quot; logo icon. The use of a camel with the
topic of Perl is a trademark of O Reilly and Associates
Inc., and is used with their permission (ie distribution of
the source, compiling a Windows executable from it, and
using that executable locally). Use of the supplied camel
for anything other than a perl executables icon is
specifically not covered, and anyone wishing to redistribute
perl binaries with the icon should check directly with
OReilly beforehand.</p>

<p>Perl should build cleanly on Stratus VOS once more.</p>

<p>Selected Bug Fixes More utf8 bugs fixed, notably in how
&quot;chomp&quot;, &quot;chop&quot;, &quot;send&quot;, and
&quot;syswrite&quot; and interact with utf8 data.
Concatenation now works correctly when &quot;use
bytes;&quot; is in scope.</p>

<p>Pragmata are now correctly propagated into (?{...})
constructions in regexps. Code such as</p>

<p>my $x = qr{ ... (??{ $x }) ... };</p>

<p>will now (correctly) fail under use strict. (As the
inner $x is and has always referred to $::x)</p>

<p>The &quot;const in void context&quot; warning has been
suppressed for a constant in an optimised-away boolean
expression such as &quot;5 || print;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;perl -i&quot; could &quot;fchmod(stdin)&quot; by
mistake. This is serious if stdin is attached to a terminal,
and perl is running as root. Now fixed.</p>

<p>New or Changed Diagnostics &quot;Carp&quot; and the
internal diagnostic routines used by &quot;Devel::Peek&quot;
have been made clearer, as described in &quot;Incompatible
Changes&quot;</p>

<p>Changed Internals Some bugs have been fixed in the hash
internals. Restricted hashes and their place holders are now
allocated and deleted at slightly different times, but this
should not be visible to user code.</p>

<p>Future Directions Code freeze for the next maintenance
release (5.8.5) will be on 30th June 2004, with release by
mid July.</p>

<p>Platform Specific Problems This release is known not to
build on Windows 95.</p>

<p>Reporting Bugs If you find what you think is a bug, you
might check the articles recently posted to the
comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
http://bugs.perl.org. There may also be information at
http://www.perl.org, the Perl Home Page.</p>

<p>If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run
the perlbug program included with your release. Be sure to
trim your bug down to a tiny but sufficient test case. Your
bug report, along with the output of &quot;perl -V&quot;,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the
Perl porting team. You can browse and search the Perl 5 bugs
at http://bugs.perl.org/</p>
