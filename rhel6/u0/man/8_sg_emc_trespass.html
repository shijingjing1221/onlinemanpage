<p>NAME sg_emc_trespass - Changes ownership of a LUN from
another Service-Pro- cessor to this one.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sg_emc_trespass [-d] [-hr] [-s] [-V] DEVICE</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION sg_emc_trespass sends an EMC-specific
Trespass Command to the DEVICE with the selected options.
This Mode Select changes the ownership of the LUN of the
device from another Service-Processor to the one the command
was received on.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Arguments to long options are mandatory for
short options as well.</p>

<p>-d outputs some extra debug information associated with
executing this command</p>

<p>-hr Sets the Honor Reservation bit in the command. If
set, the trespass will only succeed to change the ownership
from the Peer SP if the Peer SP does not have an outstanding
SCSI reservation for the LUN. By default, the reservation
state will be ignored.</p>

<p>-s Send the short version of the trespass command
instead of the long version. The short version is supported
on the EMC FC5300, FC4500 and FC4700. The long version
(default) is supported on the CLARiiON CX and AX family
arrays.</p>

<p>-V print out version string then exit.</p>

<p>In the 2.4 series of Linux kernels the DEVICE must be a
SCSI generic (sg) device. In the 2.6 series block devices
(e.g. SCSI disks and DVD drives) can also be specified. For
example &quot;sg_start 0 /dev/sda&quot; will work in the 2.6
series kernels.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The exit status of sg_emc_trespass is 0 when
it is successful. Other- wise see the sg3_utils(8) man
page.</p>
