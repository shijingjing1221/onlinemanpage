<p>NAME doveadm-kick - Disconnect users by user name and/or
IP address</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS doveadm [-Dv] kick [ -a anvil_socket_path] [-f]
user doveadm [-Dv] kick [ -a anvil_socket_path] [-f]
ip[/mask] doveadm [-Dv] kick [ -a anvil_socket_path] [-f]
user ip[/mask]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION doveadm&rsquo;s kick command is used to
disconnect users by user name and/or the ip address, from
which they are connected.</p>

<p>In the first form, all users, whose login name matches
the user argu- ment, will be disconnected.</p>

<p>In the second form, all users, connected from the given
IP address or network range, will be disconnected.</p>

<p>In the last form, only users connected from the given IP
address or networks range and a matching login name will be
disconnected.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Global doveadm(1) options:</p>

<p>-D Enables verbosity and debug messages.</p>

<p>-v Enables verbosity, including progress counter.</p>

<p>Command specific options:</p>

<p>-a anvil_socket_path This option is used to specify an
absolute path to an alterna- tive UNIX domain socket.</p>

<p>By default doveadm(1) will use the socket /var/run/dove-
cot/anvil. The socket may be located in another directory,
when the default base_dir setting was overridden in
/etc/dove- cot/dovecot.conf.</p>

<p>-f Enforce the disconnect, even when there are multiple
users, from different networks, connected to a single
process. This option may be only required when you have
configured something like:</p>

<p>service imap { ... client_limit = 1+n service_count = 0
... }</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS ip[/mask] ip or ip/mask is the host or
network, from which the users are connected.</p>

<p>user Is a user&rsquo;s login name. Depending on the
configuration, a login name may be for example jane or
john@example.com. It&rsquo;s also possible to use
&rsquo;*&rsquo; and &rsquo;?&rsquo; wildcards (e.g. -u
*@example.org).</p>

<p>EXAMPLE If you don&rsquo;t want to disconnect all users
at once, you can check who&rsquo;s currently logged in. The
first example demonstrates how to disconnect all users whose
login name is 3 characters long and begins with ba.</p>

<p>doveadm who -1 ja* username proto pid ip jane imap 8192
::1 james imap 8203 2001:db8:543:2::1 doveadm kick ba?
kicked connections from the following users: bar baz</p>

<p>The next example shows how to kick user foo&rsquo;s
connections from 192.0.2.*.</p>

<p>doveadm who -1 foo username proto pid ip foo imap 8135
fd95:4eed:38ba::25 foo imap 9112 192.0.2.53 foo imap 8216
192.0.2.111 doveadm kick foo 192.0.2.0/24 kicked connections
from the following users: foo doveadm who f* username #
proto (pids) (ips) foo 1 imap (8135)
(fd95:4eed:38ba::25)</p>
