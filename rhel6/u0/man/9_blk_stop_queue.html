<p>BLK_STOP_QUEUE(9) Block Devices BLK_STOP_QUEUE(9)</p>

<p>NAME blk_stop_queue - stop a queue</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS void blk_stop_queue(struct request_queue *
q);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS q The struct request_queue in question</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The Linux block layer assumes that a block
driver will consume all entries on the request queue when
the request_fn strategy is called. Often this will not
happen, because of hardware limitations (queue depth
settings). If a device driver gets a &acute;queue
full&acute; response, or if it simply chooses not to queue
more I/O at one point, it can call this function to prevent
the request_fn from being called until the driver has
signalled it&acute;s ready to go again. This happens by
calling blk_start_queue to restart queue operations. Queue
lock must be held.</p>
