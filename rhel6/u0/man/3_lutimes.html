<p>FUTIMES(3) Linux Programmer s Manual FUTIMES(3)</p>

<p>NAME futimes, lutimes - change file timestamps</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/time.h&gt;</p>

<p>int futimes(int fd, const struct timeval tv[2]);</p>

<p>int lutimes(const char *filename, const struct timeval
tv[2]);</p>

<p>Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
feature_test_macros(7)):</p>

<p>futimes(), lutimes(): _BSD_SOURCE</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION futimes() changes the access and
modification times of a file in the same way as utimes(2),
with the difference that the file whose times- tamps are to
be changed is specified via a file descriptor, fd, rather
than via a pathname.</p>

<p>lutimes() changes the access and modification times of a
file in the same way as utimes(2), with the difference that
if filename refers to a symbolic link, then the link is not
dereferenced: instead, the times- tamps of the symbolic link
are changed.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, zero is returned. On error, -1
is returned, and errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS Errors are as for utimes(2), with the following
additions for futimes():</p>

<p>EBADF fd is not a valid file descriptor.</p>

<p>ENOSYS The /proc file system could not be accessed.</p>

<p>VERSIONS futimes() is available since glibc 2.3.
lutimes() is available since glibc 2.6, and is implemented
using the utimensat(2) system call, which is supported since
kernel 2.6.22.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO These functions are not specified in any
standard. Other than Linux, they are only available on the
BSDs.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO utimensat(2), utime(2), symlink(7)</p>
