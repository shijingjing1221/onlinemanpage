<p>POSTALIAS(1) POSTALIAS(1)</p>

<p>NAME postalias - Postfix alias database maintenance</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS postalias [-Nfinoprsvw] [-c config_dir] [-d
key] [-q key] [file_type:]file_name ...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The postalias(1) command creates or queries
one or more Postfix alias databases, or updates an existing
one. The input and output file for- mats are expected to be
compatible with Sendmail version 8, and are expected to be
suitable for the use as NIS alias maps.</p>

<p>If the result files do not exist they will be created
with the same group and other read permissions as their
source file.</p>

<p>While a database update is in progress, signal delivery
is postponed, and an exclusive, advisory, lock is placed on
the entire database, in order to avoid surprises in
spectator processes.</p>

<p>The format of Postfix alias input files is described in
aliases(5).</p>

<p>By default the lookup key is mapped to lowercase to make
the lookups case insensitive; as of Postfix 2.3 this case
folding happens only with tables whose lookup keys are
fixed-case strings such as btree:, dbm: or hash:. With
earlier versions, the lookup key is folded even with tables
where a lookup field can match both upper and lower case
text, such as regexp: and pcre:. This resulted in loss of
information with $number substitutions.</p>

<p>Options:</p>

<p>-c config_dir Read the main.cf configuration file in the
named directory instead of the default configuration
directory.</p>

<p>-d key Search the specified maps for key and remove one
entry per map. The exit status is zero when the requested
information was found.</p>

<p>If a key value of - is specified, the program reads key
values from the standard input stream. The exit status is
zero when at least one of the requested keys was found.</p>

<p>-f Do not fold the lookup key to lower case while
creating or querying a table.</p>

<p>With Postfix version 2.3 and later, this option has no
effect for regular expression tables. There, case folding is
controlled by appending a flag to a pattern.</p>

<p>-i Incremental mode. Read entries from standard input
and do not truncate an existing database. By default,
postalias(1) creates a new database from the entries in
file_name.</p>

<p>-N Include the terminating null character that
terminates lookup keys and values. By default, postalias(1)
does whatever is the default for the host operating
system.</p>

<p>-n Don t include the terminating null character that
terminates lookup keys and values. By default, postalias(1)
does whatever is the default for the host operating
system.</p>

<p>-o Do not release root privileges when processing a
non-root input file. By default, postalias(1) drops root
privileges and runs as the source file owner instead.</p>

<p>-p Do not inherit the file access permissions from the
input file when creating a new file. Instead, create a new
file with default access permissions (mode 0644).</p>

<p>-q key Search the specified maps for key and write the
first value found to the standard output stream. The exit
status is zero when the requested information was found.</p>

<p>If a key value of - is specified, the program reads key
values from the standard input stream and writes one line of
key: value output for each key that was found. The exit
status is zero when at least one of the requested keys was
found.</p>

<p>-r When updating a table, do not complain about attempts
to update existing entries, and make those updates
anyway.</p>

<p>-s Retrieve all database elements, and write one line of
key: value output for each element. The elements are printed
in database order, which is not necessarily the same as the
original input order. This feature is available in Postfix
version 2.2 and later, and is not available for all database
types.</p>

<p>-v Enable verbose logging for debugging purposes.
Multiple -v options make the software increasingly
verbose.</p>

<p>-w When updating a table, do not complain about attempts
to update existing entries, and ignore those attempts.</p>

<p>Arguments:</p>

<p>file_type The database type. To find out what types are
supported, use the &quot;postconf -m&quot; command.</p>

<p>The postalias(1) command can query any supported file
type, but it can create only the following file types:</p>

<p>btree The output is a btree file, named file_name.db.
This is available on systems with support for db
databases.</p>

<p>cdb The output is one file named file_name.cdb. This is
available on systems with support for cdb databases.</p>

<p>dbm The output consists of two files, named
file_name.pag and file_name.dir. This is available on
systems with support for dbm databases.</p>

<p>hash The output is a hashed file, named file_name.db.
This is available on systems with support for db
databases.</p>

<p>sdbm The output consists of two files, named
file_name.pag and file_name.dir. This is available on
systems with support for sdbm databases.</p>

<p>When no file_type is specified, the software uses the
database type specified via the default_database_type
configuration parameter. The default value for this
parameter depends on the host environment.</p>

<p>file_name The name of the alias database source file
when creating a database.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS Problems are logged to the standard error
stream and to syslogd(8). No output means that no problems
were detected. Duplicate entries are skipped and are flagged
with a warning.</p>

<p>postalias(1) terminates with zero exit status in case of
success (including successful &quot;postalias -q&quot;
lookup) and terminates with non- zero exit status in case of
failure.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT MAIL_CONFIG Directory with Postfix
configuration files.</p>

<p>MAIL_VERBOSE Enable verbose logging for debugging
purposes.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS The following main.cf
parameters are especially relevant to this pro- gram.</p>

<p>The text below provides only a parameter summary. See
postconf(5) for more details including examples.</p>

<p>alias_database (seepostconf -doutput) The alias
databases for local(8) delivery that are updated with
&quot;newaliases&quot; or with &quot;sendmail -bi&quot;.</p>

<p>config_directory (seepostconf -doutput) The default
location of the Postfix main.cf and master.cf con-
figuration files.</p>

<p>berkeley_db_create_buffer_size (16777216) The per-table
I/O buffer size for programs that create Berkeley DB hash or
btree tables.</p>

<p>berkeley_db_read_buffer_size (131072) The per-table I/O
buffer size for programs that read Berkeley DB hash or btree
tables.</p>

<p>default_database_type (seepostconf -doutput) The default
database type for use in newaliases(1), postalias(1) and
postmap(1) commands.</p>

<p>syslog_facility (mail) The syslog facility of Postfix
logging.</p>

<p>syslog_name (seepostconf -doutput) The mail system name
that is prepended to the process name in syslog records, so
that &quot;smtpd&quot; becomes, for example, &quot;post-
fix/smtpd&quot;.</p>
