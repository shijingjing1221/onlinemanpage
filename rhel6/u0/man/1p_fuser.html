<p>FUSER(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual FUSER(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME fuser - list process IDs of all processes that have
one or more files open</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS fuser [ -cfu ] file ...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The fuser utility shall write to standard
output the process IDs of processes running on the local
system that have one or more named files open. For block
special devices, all processes using any file on that device
are listed.</p>

<p>The fuser utility shall write to standard error
additional information about the named files indicating how
the file is being used.</p>

<p>Any output for processes running on remote systems that
have a named file open is unspecified.</p>

<p>A user may need appropriate privilege to invoke the
fuser utility.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The fuser utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>The following options shall be supported:</p>

<p>-c The file is treated as a mount point and the utility
shall report on any files open in the file system.</p>

<p>-f The report shall be only for the named files.</p>

<p>-u The user name, in parentheses, associated with each
process ID written to standard output shall be written to
standard error.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p>file A pathname on which the file or file system is to
be reported.</p>

<p>STDIN Not used.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES The user database.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of fuser:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in
arguments).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT The fuser utility shall write the process ID for
each process using each file given as an operand to standard
output in the following for- mat:</p>

<p>&quot;%d&quot;, &lt;process_id&gt;</p>

<p>STDERR The fuser utility shall write diagnostic messages
to standard error.</p>

<p>The fuser utility also shall write the following to
standard error:</p>

<p>* The pathname of each named file is written followed
immediately by a colon.</p>

<p>* For each process ID written to standard output, the
character c shall be written to standard error if the
process is using the file as its current directory and the
characterrshall be written to standard error if the process
is using the file as its root direc- tory. Implementations
may write other alphabetic characters to indi- cate other
uses of files.</p>

<p>* When the -u option is specified, characters indicating
the use of the file shall be followed immediately by the
user name, in paren- theses, corresponding to the process
real user ID. If the user name cannot be resolved from the
process real user ID, the process real user ID shall be
written instead of the user name.</p>

<p>When standard output and standard error are directed to
the same file, the output shall be interleaved so that the
filename appears at the start of each line, followed by the
process ID and characters indicat- ing the use of the file.
Then, if the -u option is specified, the user name or user
ID for each process using that file shall be written.</p>

<p>A &lt;newline&gt; shall be written to standard error
after the last output described above for each file
operand.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 Successful completion.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES The command:</p>

<p>fuser -fu .</p>

<p>writes to standard output the process IDs of processes
that are using the current directory and writes to standard
error an indication of how those processes are using the
directory and the user names associated with the processes
that are using the current directory.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The definition of the fuser utility follows
existing practice.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO None.</p>
