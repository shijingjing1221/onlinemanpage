<p>NAME klist - list cached Kerberos tickets</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS klist [-e] [[-c] [-f] [-s] [-a [-n]]] [-k [-t]
[-K]] [cache_name | keytab_name]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Klist lists the Kerberos principal and
Kerberos tickets held in a cre- dentials cache, or the keys
held in a keytab file.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -e displays the encryption types of the session
key and the ticket for each credential in the credential
cache, or each key in the keytab file.</p>

<p>-c List tickets held in a credentials cache. This is the
default if neither -c nor -k is specified.</p>

<p>-f shows the flags present in the credentials, using the
following abbreviations:</p>

<p>F Forwardable f forwarded P Proxiable p proxy D
postDateable d postdated R Renewable I Initial i invalid H
Hardware authenticated A preAuthenticated T Transit policy
checked O Okay as delegate a anonymous</p>

<p>-s causes klist to run silently (produce no output), but
to still set the exit status according to whether it finds
the creden- tials cache. The exit status is 0 if klist finds
a creden- tials cache, and 1 if it does not or if the
tickets are expired.</p>

<p>-a display list of addresses in credentials.</p>

<p>-n show numeric addresses instead of reverse-resolving
addresses.</p>

<p>-k List keys held in a keytab file.</p>

<p>-t display the time entry timestamps for each keytab
entry in the keytab file.</p>

<p>-K display the value of the encryption key in each
keytab entry in the keytab file.</p>

<p>If cache_name or keytab_name is not specified, klist
will display the credentials in the default credentials
cache or keytab file as appro- priate. If the KRB5CCNAME
environment variable is set, its value is used to name the
default ticket cache.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT Klist uses the following environment
variables:</p>

<p>KRB5CCNAME Location of the Kerberos 5 credentials
(ticket) cache.</p>

<p>FILES /tmp/krb5cc_[uid] default location of Kerberos 5
credentials cache ([uid] is the decimal UID of the
user).</p>

<p>/etc/krb5.keytab default location for the local hosts
keytab file.</p>
