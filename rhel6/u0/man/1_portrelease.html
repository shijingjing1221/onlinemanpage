<p>PORTRELEASE(1) TCP port reservation utility
PORTRELEASE(1)</p>

<p>NAME portrelease - release previously-reserved ports</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS portrelease [SVC]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The portrelease program instructs the
portreserve daemon to release the port associated with the
given service configuration file.</p>

<p>It is intended that portrelease is run by the initscript
of the service wanting the port. For example, the cups
initscript might run portrelease cups.</p>

<p>EXIT CODE An exit code of zero means that a best effort
attempt has been made to instruct the daemon to release the
port. Non-zero exit codes mean that the daemon is running
but couldn&acute;t be contacted.</p>
