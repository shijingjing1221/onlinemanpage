<p>NAME fc-cache - build font information cache files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS fc-cache [ -fsvVh ] [ --force ] [ --system-only
] [ --verbose ] [ --version ] [ --help ] [ dir... ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION fc-cache scans the font directories on the
system and builds font information cache files for
applications using fontconfig for their font handling.</p>

<p>If directory arguments are not given, fc-cache uses each
directory in the current font configuration. Each directory
is scanned for font files readable by FreeType. A cache is
created which contains proper- ties of each font and the
associated filename. This cache is used to speed up
application startup when using the fontconfig library.</p>

<p>Note that fc-cache must be executed once per
architecture to generate font information customized for
that architecture.</p>

<p>OPTIONS This program follows the usual GNU command line
syntax, with long options starting with two dashes (-). A
summary of options is included below.</p>

<p>-f Force re-generation of apparently up-to-date cache
files, over- riding the timestamp checking.</p>

<p>-s Only scan system-wide directories, omitting the
places located in the users home directory.</p>

<p>-v Display status information while busy.</p>

<p>-h Show summary of options.</p>

<p>-V Show version of the program and exit.</p>

<p>dir Directory to scan for fonts.</p>

<p>FILES %cachdir%/*-%arch%.cache-2 These files are
generated by fc-cache and contain maps from file names to
font properties. They are read by the fontconfig library at
application startup to locate appropriate fonts.</p>
