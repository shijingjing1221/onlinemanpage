<p>UNIQ(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual UNIQ(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME uniq - report or filter out repeated lines in a
file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS uniq [-c|-d|-u][-f fields][-s char][input_file
[output_file]]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The uniq utility shall read an input file
comparing adjacent lines, and write one copy of each input
line on the output. The second and suc- ceeding copies of
repeated adjacent input lines shall not be written.</p>

<p>Repeated lines in the input shall not be detected if
they are not adja- cent.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The uniq utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>The following options shall be supported:</p>

<p>-c Precede each output line with a count of the number
of times the line occurred in the input.</p>

<p>-d Suppress the writing of lines that are not repeated
in the input.</p>

<p>-f fields Ignore the first fields fields on each input
line when doing comparisons, where fields is a positive
decimal integer. A field is the maximal string matched by
the basic regular expression:</p>

<p>[[:blank:]]*[^[:blank:]]*</p>

<p>If the fields option-argument specifies more fields than
appear on an input line, a null string shall be used for
comparison.</p>

<p>-s chars Ignore the first chars characters when doing
comparisons, where chars shall be a positive decimal
integer. If specified in con- junction with the -f option,
the first chars characters after the first fields fields
shall be ignored. If the chars option- argument specifies
more characters than remain on an input line, a null string
shall be used for comparison.</p>

<p>-u Suppress the writing of lines that are repeated in
the input.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operands shall be supported:</p>

<p>input_file A pathname of the input file. If the
input_file operand is not specified, or if the input_file
is, the standard input shall be used.</p>

<p>output_file A pathname of the output file. If the
output_file operand is not specified, the standard output
shall be used. The results are unspecified if the file named
by output_file is the file named by input_file.</p>

<p>STDIN The standard input shall be used only if no
input_file operand is spec- ified or if input_file is-. See
the INPUT FILES section.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES The input file shall be a text file.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of uniq:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_COLLATE</p>

<p>Determine the locale for ordering rules.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments
and input files) and which characters constitute a
&lt;blank&gt; in the current locale.</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT The standard output shall be used only if no
output_file operand is specified. See the OUTPUT FILES
section.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES If the -c option is specified, the output
file shall be empty or each line shall be of the form:</p>

<p>&quot;%d %s&quot;, &lt;number of duplicates&gt;,
&lt;line&gt;</p>

<p>otherwise, the output file shall be empty or each line
shall be of the form:</p>

<p>&quot;%s&quot;, &lt;line&gt;</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 The utility executed successfully.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The sort utility can be used to cause
repeated lines to be adjacent in the input file.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES The following input file data (but flushed
left) was used for a test series on uniq:</p>

<p>#01 foo0 bar0 foo1 bar1 #02 bar0 foo1 bar1 foo1 #03 foo0
bar0 foo1 bar1 #04 #05 foo0 bar0 foo1 bar1 #06 foo0 bar0
foo1 bar1 #07 bar0 foo1 bar1 foo0</p>

<p>What follows is a series of test invocations of the uniq
utility that use a mixture of uniq options against the input
file data. These tests verify the meaning of adjacent. The
uniq utility views the input data as a sequence of strings
delimited byn . Accordingly, for the fieldsth member of the
sequence, uniq interprets unique or repeated adjacent lines
strictly relative to the fields+1th member.</p>

<p>1. This first example tests the line counting option,
comparing each line of the input file data starting from the
second field:</p>

<p>uniq -c -f 1 uniq_0I.t 1 #01 foo0 bar0 foo1 bar1 1 #02
bar0 foo1 bar1 foo0 1 #03 foo0 bar0 foo1 bar1 1 #04 2 #05
foo0 bar0 foo1 bar1 1 #07 bar0 foo1 bar1 foo0</p>

<p>The number, prefixing the fifth line of output,
signifies that the uniq utility detected a pair of repeated
lines. Given the input data, this can only be true when uniq
is run using the -f 1 option (which shall cause uniq to
ignore the first field on each input line).</p>

<p>2. The second example tests the option to suppress
unique lines, com- paring each line of the input file data
starting from the second field:</p>

<p>uniq -d -f 1 uniq_0I.t #05 foo0 bar0 foo1 bar1</p>

<p>3. This test suppresses repeated lines, comparing each
line of the input file data starting from the second
field:</p>

<p>uniq -u -f 1 uniq_0I.t #01 foo0 bar0 foo1 bar1 #02 bar0
foo1 bar1 foo1 #03 foo0 bar0 foo1 bar1 #04 #07 bar0 foo1
bar1 foo0</p>

<p>4. This suppresses unique lines, comparing each line of
the input file data starting from the third character:</p>

<p>uniq -d -s 2 uniq_0I.t</p>

<p>In the last example, the uniq utility found no input
matching the above criteria.</p>

<p>RATIONALE Some historical implementations have limited
lines to be 1080 bytes in length, which does not meet the
implied {LINE_MAX} limit.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
