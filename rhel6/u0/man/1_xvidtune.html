<p>NAME xvidtune - video mode tuner for Xorg</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS xvidtune [ -show | -prev | -next | -unlock ] [
-toolkitoption ... ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Xvidtune is a client interface to the X
server video mode extension (XFree86-VidModeExtension).</p>

<p>When given one of the non-toolkit options, xvidtune
provides a command line interface to either switch the video
mode.</p>

<p>Without any options (or with only toolkit options) it
presents the user with various buttons and sliders that can
be used to interactively adjust existing video modes. It
will also print the settings in a for- mat suitable for
inclusion in an xorg.conf file.</p>

<p>Normally the Xorg X servers only allow changes to be
made with the XFree86-VidModeExtension from clients
connected via a local connection type.</p>

<p>Note: The original mode settings can be restored by
pressing the R key, and this can be used to restore a stable
screen in situations where the screen becomes
unreadable.</p>

<p>The available buttons are:</p>

<p>Left Right Up Down Adjust the video mode so that the
display will be moved in the appropriate direction.</p>

<p>Wider Narrower Shorter Taller Adjust the video mode so
that the display size is altered appropriately.</p>

<p>Quit Exit the program.</p>

<p>Apply Adjust the current video mode to match the
selected settings.</p>

<p>Auto Cause the Up/Down/Right/Left,
Wider/Narrower/Shorter/Taller, Restore, and the special S3
buttons to be applied immedi- ately. This button can be
toggled.</p>

<p>Test Temporarily switch to the selected settings.</p>

<p>Restore Return the settings to their original
values.</p>

<p>Fetch Query the server for its current settings.</p>

<p>Show Print the currently selected settings to stdout in
xorg.conf &quot;Modeline&quot; format. The primary selection
is similarly set.</p>

<p>Next Switch the Xserver to the next video mode.</p>

<p>Prev Switch the Xserver to the previous video mode.</p>

<p>For some S3-based cards (964 and 968) the following are
also available:</p>

<p>InvertVCLK Change the VCLK invert/non-invert state.</p>

<p>EarlySC Change the Early SC state. This affects screen
wrapping.</p>

<p>BlankDelay1 BlankDelay2 Set the blank delay values. This
affects screen wrapping. Acceptable values are in the range
0-7. The values may be incremented or decremented with the +
and - buttons, or by pressing the + or - keys in the text
field.</p>

<p>For S3-864/868 based cards InvertVCLK and BlankDelay1
may be useful. For S3 Trio32/Trio64 cards only InvertVCLK is
available. At the moment there are no default settings
available for these chips in the video mode extension and
thus this feature is disabled in xvidtune. It can be enabled
by setting any of the optional S3 commands in the screen
section of xorg.conf, e.g. using blank_delay &quot;&quot;
0</p>

<p>OPTIONS xvidtune accepts the standard X Toolkit command
line options as well as the following:</p>

<p>-show Print the current settings to stdout in xorg.conf
&quot;Modeline&quot; format and exit.</p>

<p>-prev Switch the Xserver to the previous video mode.</p>

<p>-next Switch the Xserver to the next video mode.</p>

<p>-unlock Normally, xvidtune will disable the switching of
video modes via hot-keys while it is running. If for some
reason the program did not exit cleanly and they are still
disabled, the program can be re-run with this option to
re-enable the mode switching key combinations.</p>

<p>BUGS X Error handling, i.e. when the server does not
allow xvidtune clients to write new modes, could be
better.</p>
