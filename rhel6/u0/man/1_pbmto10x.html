<p>NAME pbmto10x - convert a PBM image into Gemini 10X
printer graphics</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pbmto10x [-h] [pbmfile]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pbmto10x reads a PBM image as input and produces a file
of Gemini 10X printer graphics as output. The 10xs printer
codes are alleged to be similar to the Epson codes.</p>

<p>Note that there is no 10xtopbm tool - this
transformation is one way.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The resolution is normally 60H by 72V. If you
specify the -h option, resolution is 120H by 144V. You may
find it useful to rotate landscape images before
printing.</p>
