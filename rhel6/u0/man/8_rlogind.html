<p>RLOGIND(8) BSD System Manager s Manual RLOGIND(8)</p>

<p>NAME rlogind - remote login server</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rlogind [-ahlLn]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Rlogind is the server for the rlogin(1)
program. The server provides a remote login facility with
authentication based on privileged port num- bers from
trusted hosts.</p>

<p>Options supported by rlogind:</p>

<p>-a Ask hostname for verification.</p>

<p>-h Permit use of superuser .rhosts files.</p>

<p>-l Prevent any authentication based on the user s
.rhosts file. If the user is logging in as the superuser and
the -h option is used, .rhosts processing is still
enabled.</p>

<p>-L Prevent any authentication based on .rhosts or
hosts.equiv information.</p>

<p>-n Disable keep-alive messages.</p>

<p>The -h, -l, and -L flags are not used if PAM (Pluggable
Authentication Module) support is in use. In this case the
same effects can be achieved by editing /etc/pam.conf.</p>

<p>The -h and -l options should also not be trusted without
verifying that they work as expected with the particular
version of libc installed on your system (and should be
tested again after any libc update) because some versions of
libc may not honor the internal flags used by rlogind. As
the -L option bypasses the libc functions entirely, it is
not subject to this problem.</p>

<p>Also note that the design of the .rhosts system is
COMPLETELY INSECURE except on a carefully firewalled private
network. Always use the -L option under all other
circumstances. Also, since rlogind does not encrypt
communications, it should not, in general, be used at all.
Con- sider ssh(8).</p>

<p>Rlogind listens for service requests at the port
indicated in the login service specification; see
services(5). When a service request is received the
following protocol is initiated:</p>

<p>1. The server checks the clients source port. If the
port is not in the range 512-1023, the server aborts the
connection.</p>

<p>2. The server checks the client s source address and
requests the cor- responding host name (see
gethostbyaddr(3), hosts(5) and named(8)). If the hostname
cannot be determined, the dot-notation representa- tion of
the host address is used. If the hostname is in the same
domain as the server (according to the last two components
of the domain name), or if the -a option is given, the
addresses for the hostname are requested, verifying that the
name and address corre- spond. Normal authentication is
bypassed if the address verifica- tion fails.</p>

<p>Once the source port and address have been checked,
rlogind proceeds with the authentication process described
in rshd(8). It then allocates a pseudo terminal (see
pty(4)), and manipulates file descriptors so that the slave
half of the pseudo terminal becomes the stdin, stdout, and
stderr for a login process. The login process is an instance
of the login(1) program, invoked with the -f option if
authentication has suc- ceeded. If automatic authentication
fails, the user is prompted to log in as if on a standard
terminal line.</p>

<p>The parent of the login process manipulates the master
side of the pseudo terminal, operating as an intermediary
between the login process and the client instance of the
rlogin program. In normal operation, the packet protocol
described in pty(4) is invoked to provide ^S/^Q type facili-
ties and propagate interrupt signals to the remote programs.
The login process propagates the client terminal s baud rate
and terminal type, as found in the environment variable,
TERM ; see environ(7). The screen or window size of the
terminal is requested from the client, and window size
changes from the client are propagated to the pseudo
terminal.</p>

<p>Transport-level keepalive messages are enabled unless
the -n option is present. The use of keepalive messages
allows sessions to be timed out if the client crashes or
becomes unreachable.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS All initial diagnostic messages are
indicated by a leading byte with a value of 1, after which
any network connections are closed. If there are no errors
before login is invoked, a null byte is returned as in
indica- tion of success.</p>

<p>Try again. A fork by the server failed.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO login(1), ruserok(3), rshd(8)</p>

<p>BUGS The authentication procedure used here assumes the
integrity of each client machine and the connecting medium.
This is insecure, but is use- ful in an open
environment.</p>

<p>A facility to allow all data exchanges to be encrypted
should be present.</p>

<p>A more extensible protocol should be used.</p>

<p>HISTORY The rlogind command appeared in 4.2BSD.</p>
