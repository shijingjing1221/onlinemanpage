<p>KRB5KDC(8) KRB5KDC(8)</p>

<p>NAME krb5kdc - Kerberos V5 KDC</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS krb5kdc [ -x db_args ] [ -d dbname ] [ -k
keytype ] [ -M mkeyname ] [ -p portnum ] [ -m ] [ -r realm ]
[ -n ] [ -P pid_file ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION krb5kdc is the Kerberos version 5
Authentication Service and Key Dis- tribution Center
(AS/KDC).</p>

<p>The -x db_args option specifies the database specific
arguments.</p>

<p>Options supported for LDAP database are:</p>

<p>-x nconns=&lt;number_of_connections&gt; specifies the
number of connections to be maintained per LDAP server.</p>

<p>-x host=&lt;ldapuri&gt; specifies the LDAP server to
connect to by a LDAP URI.</p>

<p>-x binddn=&lt;binddn&gt; specifies the DN of the object
used by the KDC server to bind to the LDAP server. This
object should have the rights to read the realm container,
principal container and the subtree that is referenced by
the realm.</p>

<p>-x bindpwd=&lt;bind_password&gt; specifies the password
for the above mentioned binddn. It is recommended not to use
this option. Instead, the password can be stashed using the
stashsrvpw command of kdb5_ldap_util.</p>

<p>The -r realm option specifies the realm for which the
server should provide service; by default the realm returned
by krb5_default_local_realm(3) is used.</p>

<p>The -d dbname option specifies the name under which the
principal database can be found; by default the database is
in DEFAULT_DBM_FILE. This option does not apply to the LDAP
database.</p>

<p>The -k keytype option specifies the key type of the
master key to be entered manually as a password when -m is
given; the default is &quot;des-cbc-crc&quot;.</p>

<p>The -M mkeyname option specifies the principal name for
the master key in the database; the default is
KRB5_KDB_M_NAME (usually &quot;K/M&quot; in the KDCs
realm).</p>

<p>The -p portnum option specifies the default UDP port
number which the KDC should listen on for Kerberos version 5
requests. This value is used when no port is specified in
the KDC profile and when no port is specified in the
Kerberos configuration file. If no value is avail- able,
then the value in /etc/services for service
&quot;kerberos&quot; is used.</p>

<p>The -m option specifies that the master database
password should be fetched from the keyboard rather than
from a file on disk.</p>

<p>The -n option specifies that the KDC does not put itself
in the back- ground and does not disassociate itself from
the terminal. In normal operation, you should always allow
the KDC to place itself in the back- ground.</p>

<p>The -P pid_file option tells the KDC to write its PID
(followed by a newline) into pid_file after it starts up.
This can be used to iden- tify whether the KDC is still
running and to allow init scripts to stop the correct
process.</p>

<p>The KDC may service requests for multiple realms
(maximum 32 realms). The realms are listed on the command
line. Per-realm options that can be specified on the command
line pertain for each realm that follows it and are
superceded by subsequent definitions of the same option. For
example,</p>

<p>krb5kdc -p 2001 -r REALM1 -p 2002 -r REALM2 -r
REALM3</p>

<p>specifies that the KDC listen on port 2001 for REALM1
and on port 2002 for REALM2 and REALM3. Additionally,
per-realm parameters may be spec- ified in the kdc.conf
file. The location of this file may be specified by the
KRB5_KDC_PROFILE environment variable. Parameters specified
in this file take precedence over options specified on the
command line. See the kdc.conf(5) description for further
details.</p>

kdb5_ldap_util(8)</p>

<p>BUGS It should fork and go into the background when it
finishes reading the master password from the terminal.</p>
