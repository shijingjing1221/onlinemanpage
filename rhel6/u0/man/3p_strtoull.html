<p>STRTOUL(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual STRTOUL(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME strtoul, strtoull - convert a string to an unsigned
long</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</p>

<p>unsigned long strtoul(const char *restrict str, char
**restrict endptr, int base); unsigned long long
strtoull(const char *restrict str, char **restrict endptr,
int base);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION These functions shall convert the initial
portion of the string pointed to by str to a type unsigned
long and unsigned long long representa- tion, respectively.
First, they decompose the input string into three parts:</p>

<p>1. An initial, possibly empty, sequence of white-space
characters (as specified by isspace())</p>

<p>2. A subject sequence interpreted as an integer
represented in some radix determined by the value of
base</p>

<p>3. A final string of one or more unrecognized
characters, including the terminating null byte of the input
string</p>

<p>Then they shall attempt to convert the subject sequence
to an unsigned integer, and return the result.</p>

<p>If the value of base is 0, the expected form of the
subject sequence is that of a decimal constant, octal
constant, or hexadecimal constant, any of which may be
preceded by a+or- sign. A decimal constant begins with a
non-zero digit, and consists of a sequence of decimal
digits. An octal constant consists of the prefix 0
optionally fol- lowed by a sequence of the digits0to7only. A
hexadecimal con- stant consists of the prefix 0x or 0X
followed by a sequence of the decimal digits and
lettersa(orA) tof(orF) with values 10 to 15
respectively.</p>

<p>If the value of base is between 2 and 36, the expected
form of the sub- ject sequence is a sequence of letters and
digits representing an inte- ger with the radix specified by
base, optionally preceded by a+or -sign. The letters
froma(orA) toz(orZ) inclusive are ascribed the values 10 to
35; only letters whose ascribed values are less than that of
base are permitted. If the value of base is 16, the
characters 0x or 0X may optionally precede the sequence of
letters and digits, following the sign if present.</p>

<p>The subject sequence is defined as the longest initial
subsequence of the input string, starting with the first
non-white-space character that is of the expected form. The
subject sequence shall contain no characters if the input
string is empty or consists entirely of white- space
characters, or if the first non-white-space character is
other than a sign or a permissible letter or digit.</p>

<p>If the subject sequence has the expected form and the
value of base is 0, the sequence of characters starting with
the first digit shall be interpreted as an integer constant.
If the subject sequence has the expected form and the value
of base is between 2 and 36, it shall be used as the base
for conversion, ascribing to each letter its value as given
above. If the subject sequence begins with a minus sign, the
value resulting from the conversion shall be negated. A
pointer to the final string shall be stored in the object
pointed to by endptr, pro- vided that endptr is not a null
pointer.</p>

<p>In other than the C or POSIX locales, other
implementation-defined subject sequences may be
accepted.</p>

<p>If the subject sequence is empty or does not have the
expected form, no conversion shall be performed; the value
of str shall be stored in the object pointed to by endptr,
provided that endptr is not a null pointer.</p>

<p>The strtoul() function shall not change the setting of
errno if suc- cessful.</p>

<p>Since 0, {ULONG_MAX}, and {ULLONG_MAX} are returned on
error and are also valid returns on success, an application
wishing to check for error situations should set errno to 0,
then call strtoul() or str- toull(), then check errno.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, these functions
shall return the converted value, if any. If no conversion
could be performed, 0 shall be returned and errno may be set
to [EINVAL]. If the correct value is outside the range of
representable values, {ULONG_MAX} or {ULLONG_MAX} shall be
returned and errno set to [ERANGE].</p>

<p>ERRORS These functions shall fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The value of base is not supported.</p>

<p>ERANGE The value to be returned is not
representable.</p>

<p>These functions may fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL No conversion could be performed.</p>
