<p>KILL(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual KILL(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME kill - terminate or signal processes</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS kill -s signal_name pid ...</p>

<p>kill -l [exit_status]</p>

<p>kill [-signal_name] pid ...</p>

<p>kill [-signal_number] pid ...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The kill utility shall send a signal to the
process or processes speci- fied by each pid operand.</p>

<p>For each pid operand, the kill utility shall perform
actions equivalent to the kill() function defined in the
System Interfaces volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 called with
the following arguments:</p>

<p>* The value of the pid operand shall be used as the pid
argument.</p>

<p>* The sig argument is the value specified by the -s
option, - sig- nal_number option, or the - signal_name
option, or by SIGTERM, if none of these options is
specified.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The kill utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines, except that in the last two
SYNOPSIS forms, the - signal_number and - sig- nal_name
options are usually more than a single character.</p>

<p>The following options shall be supported:</p>

<p>-l (The letter ell.) Write all values of signal_name
supported by the implementation, if no operand is given. If
an exit_status operand is given and it is a value of the ?
shell special parameter (see Special Parameters and wait() )
corresponding to a process that was terminated by a signal,
the signal_name cor- responding to the signal that
terminated the process shall be written. If an exit_status
operand is given and it is the unsigned decimal integer
value of a signal number, the sig- nal_name (the symbolic
constant name without the SIG prefix defined in the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001) corresponding to
that signal shall be written. Otherwise, the results are
unspecified.</p>

<p>-s signal_name</p>

<p>Specify the signal to send, using one of the symbolic
names defined in the &lt;signal.h&gt; header. Values of
signal_name shall be recognized in a case-independent
fashion, without the SIG pre- fix. In addition, the symbolic
name 0 shall be recognized, rep- resenting the signal value
zero. The corresponding signal shall be sent instead of
SIGTERM.</p>

<p>-signal_name</p>

<p>Equivalent to -s signal_name.</p>

<p>-signal_number</p>

<p>Specify a non-negative decimal integer, signal_number,
repre- senting the signal to be used instead of SIGTERM, as
the sig argument in the effective call to kill(). The
correspondence between integer values and the sig value used
is shown in the following table.</p>

<p>The effects of specifying any signal_number other than
those listed in the table are undefined.</p>

<p>signal_number sig Value 0 0 1 SIGHUP 2 SIGINT 3 SIGQUIT
6 SIGABRT 9 SIGKILL 14 SIGALRM 15 SIGTERM</p>

<p>If the first argument is a negative integer, it shall be
interpreted as a - signal_number option, not as a negative
pid operand specifying a process group.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operands shall be supported:</p>

<p>pid One of the following:</p>

<p>1. A decimal integer specifying a process or process
group to be signaled. The process or processes selected by
positive, negative, and zero values of the pid operand shall
be as described for the kill() function. If process number 0
is specified, all processes in the current process group
shall be signaled. For the effects of negative pid numbers,
see the kill() function defined in the System Interfaces
volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001. If the first pid operand is
nega- tive, it should be preceded by &quot;--&quot; to keep
it from being interpreted as an option.</p>

<p>2. A job control job ID (see the Base Definitions volume
of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 3.203, Job Control Job ID)
that identifies a background process group to be signaled.
The job control job ID notation is applicable only for invo-
cations of kill in the current shell execution environment;
see Shell Execution Environment .</p>

<p>exit_status A decimal integer specifying a signal number
or the exit status of a process terminated by a signal.</p>

<p>STDIN Not used.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of kill:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in
arguments).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT When the -l option is not specified, the standard
output shall not be used.</p>

<p>When the -l option is specified, the symbolic name of
each signal shall be written in the following format:</p>

<p>&quot;%s%c&quot;, &lt;signal_name&gt;,
&lt;separator&gt;</p>

<p>where the &lt;signal_name&gt; is in uppercase, without
the SIG prefix, and the &lt;separator&gt; shall be either a
&lt;newline&gt; or a &lt;space&gt;. For the last signal
written, &lt;separator&gt; shall be a &lt;newline&gt;.</p>

<p>When both the -l option and exit_status operand are
specified, the sym- bolic name of the corresponding signal
shall be written in the follow- ing format:</p>

<p>&quot;%n&quot;, &lt;signal_name&gt;</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 At least one matching process was found for each pid
operand, and the specified signal was successfully processed
for at least one matching process.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE Process numbers can be found by using
ps.</p>

<p>The job control job ID notation is not required to work
as expected when kill is operating in its own utility
execution environment. In either of the following
examples:</p>

<p>nohup kill %1 &amp; system(&quot;kill %1&quot;);</p>

<p>the kill operates in a different environment and does
not share the shells understanding of job numbers.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Any of the commands:</p>

<p>kill -9 100 -165 kill -s kill 100 -165 kill -s KILL 100
-165</p>

<p>sends the SIGKILL signal to the process whose process ID
is 100 and to all processes whose process group ID is 165,
assuming the sending pro- cess has permission to send that
signal to the specified processes, and that they exist.</p>

<p>The System Interfaces volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 and
this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 do not require specific
signal numbers for any signal_names. Even the -
signal_number option provides symbolic (although numeric)
names for signals. If a process is terminated by a signal,
its exit status indicates the signal that killed it, but the
exact values are not specified. The kill -l option, however,
can be used to map decimal signal numbers and exit status
values into the name of a signal. The following example
reports the status of a terminated job:</p>

<p>job stat=$? if [ $stat -eq 0 ] then echo job completed
successfully. elif [ $stat -gt 128 ] then echo job
terminated by signal SIG$(kill -l $stat). else echo job
terminated with error code $stat. fi</p>

<p>To send the default signal to a process group (say 123),
an application should use a command similar to one of the
following:</p>

<p>kill -TERM -123 kill -- -123</p>

<p>RATIONALE The -l option originated from the C shell, and
is also implemented in the KornShell. The C shell output can
consist of multiple output lines because the signal names do
not always fit on a single line on some terminal screens.
The KornShell output also included the implementa-
tion-defined signal numbers and was considered by the
standard develop- ers to be too difficult for scripts to
parse conveniently. The speci- fied output format is
intended not only to accommodate the historical C shell
output, but also to permit an entirely vertical or entirely
hori- zontal listing on systems for which this is
appropriate.</p>

<p>An early proposal invented the name SIGNULL as a
signal_name for signal 0 (used by the System Interfaces
volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 to test for the existence of
a process without sending it a signal). Since the
signal_name 0 can be used in this case unambiguously,
SIGNULL has been removed.</p>

<p>An early proposal also required symbolic signal_names to
be recognized with or without the SIG prefix. Historical
versions of kill have not written the SIG prefix for the -l
option and have not recognized the SIG prefix on
signal_names. Since neither applications portability nor
ease-of-use would be improved by requiring this extension,
it is no longer required.</p>

<p>To avoid an ambiguity of an initial negative number
argument specifying either a signal number or a process
group, IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 man- dates that it is always
considered the former by implementations that support the
XSI option. It also requires that conforming applications
always use the &quot;--&quot; options terminator argument
when specifying a pro- cess group, unless an option is also
specified.</p>

<p>The -s option was added in response to international
interest in pro- viding some form of kill that meets the
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>The job control job ID notation is not required to work
as expected when kill is operating in its own utility
execution environment. In either of the following
examples:</p>

<p>nohup kill %1 &amp; system(&quot;kill %1&quot;);</p>

<p>the kill operates in a different environment and does
not understand how the shell has managed its job
numbers.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
