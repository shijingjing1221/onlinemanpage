<p>NAME gzexe - compress executable files in place</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS gzexe name ...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The gzexe utility allows you to compress
executables in place and have them automatically uncompress
and execute when you run them (at a penalty in performance).
For example if you execute gzexe /usr/bin/gdb it will create
the following two files: -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 1026675 Jun
7 13:53 /usr/bin/gdb -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 2304524 May 30
13:02 /usr/bin/gdb~ /usr/bin/gdb~ is the original file and
/usr/bin/gdb is the self-uncom- pressing executable file.
You can remove /usr/bin/gdb~ once you are sure that
/usr/bin/gdb works properly.</p>

<p>This utility is most useful on systems with very small
disks.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -d Decompress the given executables instead of
compressing them.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO gzip(1), znew(1), zmore(1), zcmp(1),
zforce(1)</p>

<p>CAVEATS The compressed executable is a shell script.
This may create some security holes. In particular, the
compressed executable relies on the PATH environment
variable to find gzip and some standard utilities (basename,
chmod, ln, mkdir, mktemp, rm, sleep, and tail).</p>

<p>BUGS gzexe attempts to retain the original file
attributes on the compressed executable, but you may have to
fix them manually in some cases, using chmod or chown.</p>
