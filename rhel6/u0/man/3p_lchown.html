<p>LCHOWN(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual LCHOWN(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME lchown - change the owner and group of a symbolic
link</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>int lchown(const char *path, uid_t owner, gid_t
group);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The lchown() function shall be equivalent to
chown(), except in the case where the named file is a
symbolic link. In this case, lchown() shall change the
ownership of the symbolic link file itself, while chown()
changes the ownership of the file or directory to which the
symbolic link refers.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, lchown() shall
return 0. Otherwise, it shall return -1 and set errno to
indicate an error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The lchown() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EACCES Search permission is denied on a component of the
path prefix of path.</p>

<p>EINVAL The owner or group ID is not a value supported by
the implemen- tation.</p>

<p>ELOOP A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during
resolution of the path argument.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG The length of a pathname exceeds {PATH_MAX}
or a pathname compo- nent is longer than {NAME_MAX}.</p>

<p>ENOENT A component of path does not name an existing
file or path is an empty string.</p>

<p>ENOTDIR A component of the path prefix of path is not a
directory.</p>

<p>EOPNOTSUPP The path argument names a symbolic link and
the implementation does not support setting the owner or
group of a symbolic link.</p>

<p>EPERM The effective user ID does not match the owner of
the file and the process does not have appropriate
privileges.</p>

<p>EROFS The file resides on a read-only file system.</p>

<p>The lchown() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EIO An I/O error occurred while reading or writing to
the file sys- tem.</p>

<p>EINTR A signal was caught during execution of the
function.</p>

<p>ELOOP More than {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic links were
encountered during resolution of the path argument.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG Pathname resolution of a symbolic link
produced an intermediate result whose length exceeds
{PATH_MAX}.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Changing the Current Owner of a File The
following example shows how to change the ownership of the
symbolic link named /modules/pass1 to the user ID associated
with &quot;jones&quot; and the group ID associated with
&quot;cnd&quot;.</p>

<p>The numeric value for the user ID is obtained by using
the getpwnam() function. The numeric value for the group ID
is obtained by using the getgrnam() function.</p>

<p>#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
#include &lt;pwd.h&gt; #include &lt;grp.h&gt;</p>

<p>struct passwd *pwd; struct group *grp; char *path =
&quot;/modules/pass1&quot;; ... pwd =
getpwnam(&quot;jones&quot;); grp =
getgrnam(&quot;cnd&quot;); lchown(path, pwd-&gt;pw_uid,
grp-&gt;gr_gid);</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE On implementations which support
symbolic links as directory entries rather than files,
lchown() may fail.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
