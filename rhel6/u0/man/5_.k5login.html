<p>NAME .k5login - Kerberos V5 acl file for host
access.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The .k5login file, which resides in a user s
home directory, contains a list of the Kerberos principals.
Anyone with valid tickets for a prin- cipal in the file is
allowed host access with the UID of the user in whose home
directory the file resides. One common use is to place a
.k5login file in roots home directory, thereby granting
system admin- istrators remote root access to the host via
Kerberos.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Suppose the user &quot;janedoe&quot; had a
.k5login file in her home directory containing the following
line:</p>

<p>johndoe@FUBAR.ORG</p>

<p>This would allow her husband &quot;johndoe&quot; to use
any of the Kerberos net- work applications, such as
telnet(1), rlogin(1), rsh(1), and rcp(1), to access her
account, using his own Kerberos tickets.</p>

<p>Let us further suppose that &quot;janedoe&quot; is a
system administrator. She and the other system
administrators would have their principals in roots .k5login
file on each host:</p>

<p>janedoe@BLEEP.COM joeadmin/root@BLEEP.COM</p>

<p>This would allow either system administrator to log in
to these hosts using their Kerberos tickets instead of
having to type the root pass- word. Note that because
&quot;janedoe&quot;s husband retains the Kerberos tick- ets
for his own principal, &quot;johndoe@FUBAR.ORG&quot;, he
would not have any of the privileges that require his wifes
tickets, such as root access to any of her sites hosts, or
the ability to change her password.</p>
