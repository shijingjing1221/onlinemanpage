<p>SPI_SETUP(9) Serial Peripheral Interface (S
SPI_SETUP(9)</p>

<p>NAME spi_setup - setup SPI mode and clock rate</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS int spi_setup(struct spi_device * spi);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS spi the device whose settings are being
modified</p>

<p>CONTEXT can sleep, and no requests are queued to the
device</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION SPI protocol drivers may need to update the
transfer mode if the device doesn&acute;t work with its
default. They may likewise need to update clock rates or
word sizes from initial values. This function changes those
settings, and must be called from a context that can sleep.
Except for SPI_CS_HIGH, which takes effect immediately, the
changes take effect the next time the device is selected and
data is transferred to or from it. When this function
returns, the spi device is deselected.</p>

<p>Note that this call will fail if the protocol driver
specifies an option that the underlying controller or its
driver does not support. For example, not all hardware
supports wire transfers using nine bit words, LSB-first wire
encoding, or active-high chipselects.</p>
