<p>Name mtype - display contents of an MSDOS file</p>

<p>Note of warning This manpage has been automatically
generated from mtoolss texinfo documentation, and may not be
entirely accurate or complete. See the end of this man page
for details.</p>

<p>Description The mtype command is used to display
contents of an MS-DOS file. Its syntax is:</p>

<p>mtype [-ts] msdosfile [ msdosfiles... ]</p>

<p>Mtype displays the specified MS-DOS file on the
screen.</p>

<p>In addition to the standard options, Mtype allows the
following command line options:</p>

<p>t Text file viewing. Mtype translates incoming carriage
return/line feeds to line feeds.</p>

<p>s Mtype strips the high bit from the data.</p>

<p>The mcd command may be used to establish the device and
the current working directory (relative to MS-DOS),
otherwise the default is A:/.</p>

<p>Mtype returns 0 on success, 1 on utter failure, or 2 on
partial fail- ure.</p>

<p>Unlike the MS-DOS version of TYPE, mtype allows multiple
arguments.</p>

<p>Viewing the texi doc This manpage has been automatically
generated from mtoolss texinfo documentation. However, this
process is only approximative, and some items, such as
crossreferences, footnotes and indices are lost in this
translation process. Indeed, these items have no appropriate
represen- tation in the manpage format. Moreover, not all
information has been translated into the manpage version.
Thus I strongly advise you to use the original texinfo doc.
See the end of this manpage for instructions how to view the
texinfo doc.</p>

<p>* To generate a printable copy from the texinfo doc, run
the fol- lowing commands:</p>

<p>./configure; make dvi; dvips mtools.dvi</p>

<p>* To generate a html copy, run:</p>

<p>./configure; make html</p>

<p>A premade html can be found at
http://www.gnu.org/software/mtools/manual/mtools.html</p>

<p>* To generate an info copy (browsable using emacs info
mode), run:</p>

<p>./configure; make info</p>

<p>The texinfo doc looks most pretty when printed or as
html. Indeed, in the info version certain examples are
difficult to read due to the quoting conventions used in
info.</p>
