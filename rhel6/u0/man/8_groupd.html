<p>GROUPD(8) cluster GROUPD(8)</p>

<p>NAME groupd - compatibility daemon for fenced,
dlm_controld and gfs_controld</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS groupd [OPTIONS]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The groupd daemon and libgroup library are
used by the fenced, dlm_con- trold and gfs_controld daemons
when they are operating in cluster2-com- patible mode to
perform a rolling cluster upgrade from cluster2 to
cluster3.</p>

<p>See cman(5) for more information on the upgrading
configuration option needed to perform a rolling
upgrade.</p>

<p>When the upgrading option is enabled, cman adds the
following to the online configuration:</p>

<p>&lt;group groupd_compat=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;</p>

<p>This setting causes the cman init script to start the
groupd daemon, and causes the groupd, fenced, dlm_controld
and gfs_controld daemons to operate in the old cluster2 mode
so they will be compatible with clus- ter2 nodes in the
cluster that have not yet been upgraded.</p>

<p>The upgrading setting, including the groupd_compat
setting, cannot be changed in a running cluster. The entire
cluster must be taken offline to change these because the
new cluster3 default modes are not compati- ble with the old
cluster2 modes. The upgrading/compat settings cause the new
cluster3 daemons to run the old cluster2 code and
protocols.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Command line options override a corresponding
setting in cluster.conf.</p>

<p>-D Enable debugging to stderr and dont fork.</p>

<p>-L Enable debugging to log file.</p>

<p>-g num groupd compatibility mode, 0 off, 1 on. Default
0.</p>

<p>-h Print a help message describing available options,
then exit.</p>

<p>-V Print program version information, then exit.</p>
