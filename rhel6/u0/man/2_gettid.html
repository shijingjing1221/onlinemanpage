<p>GETTID(2) Linux Programmer s Manual GETTID(2)</p>

<p>NAME gettid - get thread identification</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;</p>

<p>pid_t gettid(void);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION gettid() returns the callers thread ID
(TID). In a single-threaded process, the thread ID is equal
to the process ID (PID, as returned by getpid(2)). In a
multithreaded process, all threads have the same PID, but
each one has a unique TID. For further details, see the
discussion of CLONE_THREAD in clone(2).</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, returns the thread ID of the
calling process.</p>

<p>ERRORS This call is always successful.</p>

<p>VERSIONS The gettid() system call first appeared on
Linux in kernel 2.4.11.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO gettid() is Linux-specific and should not
be used in programs that are intended to be portable.</p>

<p>NOTES Glibc does not provide a wrapper for this system
call; call it using syscall(2).</p>

<p>The thread ID returned by this call is not the same
thing as a POSIX thread ID (i.e., the opaque value returned
by pthread_self(3)).</p>

<p>SEE ALSO clone(2), fork(2), getpid(2)</p>
