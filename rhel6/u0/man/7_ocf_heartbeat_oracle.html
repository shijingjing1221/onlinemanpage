<p>OCF_HEARTBEAT_ORACLE(7) OCF resource agents
OCF_HEARTBEAT_ORACLE(7)</p>

<p>NAME ocf_heartbeat_oracle - Manages an Oracle Database
instance</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS oracle [start | stop | status | monitor |
validate-all | methods | meta-data]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Resource script for oracle. Manages an
Oracle Database instance as an HA resource.</p>

<p>SUPPORTED PARAMETERS sid The Oracle SID (aka
ORACLE_SID). (required, string, no default)</p>

<p>home The Oracle home directory (aka ORACLE_HOME). If not
specified, then the SID along with its home should be listed
in /etc/oratab. (optional, string, no default)</p>

<p>user The Oracle owner (aka ORACLE_OWNER). If not
specified, then it is set to the owner of file
$ORACLE_HOME/dbs/*${ORACLE_SID}.ora. If this does not work
for you, just set it explicitely. (optional, string, no
default)</p>

<p>ipcrm Sometimes IPC objects (shared memory segments and
semaphores) belonging to an Oracle instance might be left
behind which prevents the instance from starting. It is not
easy to figure out which shared segments belong to which
instance, in particular when more instances are running as
same user. What we use here is the &quot;oradebug&quot;
feature and its &quot;ipc&quot; trace utility. It is not
optimal to parse the debugging information, but I am not
aware of any other way to find out about the IPC
information. In case the format or wording of the trace
report changes, parsing might fail. There are some
precautions, however, to prevent stepping on other peoples
toes. There is also a dumpinstipc option which will make us
print the IPC objects which belong to the instance. Use it
to see if we parse the trace file correctly. Three settings
are possible: - none: don&acute;t mess with IPC and hope for
the best (beware: you&acute;ll probably be out of luck,
sooner or later) - instance: try to figure out the IPC stuff
which belongs to the instance and remove only those
(default; should be safe) - orauser: remove all IPC
belonging to the user which runs the instance (don&acute;t
use this if you run more than one instance as same user or
if other apps running as this user use IPC) The default
setting &quot;instance&quot; should be safe to use, but in
that case we cannot guarantee that the instance will start.
In case IPC objects were already left around, because, for
instance, someone mercilessly killing Oracle processes,
there is no way any more to find out which IPC objects
should be removed. In that case, human intervention is
necessary, and probably _all_ instances running as same user
will have to be stopped. The third setting,
&quot;orauser&quot;, guarantees IPC objects removal, but it
does that based only on IPC objects ownership, so you should
use that only if every instance runs as separate user.
Please report any problems. Suggestions/fixes welcome.
(optional, string, default instance)</p>

<p>clear_backupmode The clear of the backup mode of ORACLE.
(optional, boolean, default false)</p>

<p>shutdown_method How to stop Oracle is a matter of taste
it seems. The default method (&quot;checkpoint/abort&quot;)
is: alter system checkpoint; shutdown abort; This should be
the fastest safe way bring the instance down. If you find
&quot;shutdown abort&quot; distasteful, set this attribute
to &quot;immediate&quot; in which case we will shutdown
immediate; If you still think that there&acute;s even better
way to shutdown an Oracle instance we are willing to listen.
(optional, string, default checkpoint/abort)</p>

<p>SUPPORTED ACTIONS This resource agent supports the
following actions (operations):</p>

<p>start Starts the resource. Suggested minimum timeout:
120.</p>

<p>stop Stops the resource. Suggested minimum timeout:
120.</p>

<p>status Performs a status check. Suggested minimum
timeout: 5.</p>

<p>monitor Performs a detailed status check. Suggested
minimum timeout: 30. Suggested interval: 120.</p>

<p>validate-all Performs a validation of the resource
configuration. Suggested minimum timeout: 5.</p>

<p>methods Suggested minimum timeout: 5.</p>

<p>meta-data Retrieves resource agent metadata (internal
use only). Suggested minimum timeout: 5.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE The following is an example configuration for a
oracle resource using the crm(8) shell:</p>

<p>primitive example_oracle ocf:heartbeat:oracle params
sid=string op monitor depth=&quot;0&quot;
timeout=&quot;30&quot; interval=&quot;120&quot;</p>
