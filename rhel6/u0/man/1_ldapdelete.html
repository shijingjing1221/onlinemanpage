<p>LDAPDELETE(1) LDAPDELETE(1)</p>

<p>NAME ldapdelete - LDAP delete entry tool</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ldapdelete [-n] [-v] [-c] [-M[M]] [-d
debuglevel] [-f file] [-D binddn] [-W] [-w passwd] [-y
passwdfile] [-H ldapuri] [-h ldaphost] [-P {2|3}] [-e
[!]ext[=extparam]] [-E [!]ext[=extparam]] [-p ldapport] [-O
secu- rity-properties] [-U authcid] [-R realm] [-r] [-x]
[-I] [-Q] [-X authzid] [-Y mech] [-z sizelimit] [-Z[Z]] [DN
[...]]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION ldapdelete is a shell-accessible interface
to the ldap_delete_ext(3) library call.</p>

<p>ldapdelete opens a connection to an LDAP server, binds,
and deletes one or more entries. If one or more DN arguments
are provided, entries with those Distinguished Names are
deleted. Each DN should be provided using the LDAPv3 string
representation as defined in RFC 4514. If no DN arguments
are provided, a list of DNs is read from standard input (or
from file if the -f flag is used).</p>

<p>OPTIONS -n Show what would be done, but don t actually
delete entries. Useful for debugging in conjunction with
-v.</p>

<p>-v Use verbose mode, with many diagnostics written to
standard out- put.</p>

<p>-c Continuous operation mode. Errors are reported, but
ldapdelete will continue with deletions. The default is to
exit after reporting an error.</p>

<p>-M[M] Enable manage DSA IT control. -MM makes control
critical.</p>

<p>-d debuglevel Set the LDAP debugging level to
debuglevel. ldapdelete must be compiled with LDAP_DEBUG
defined for this option to have any effect.</p>

<p>-f file Read a series of DNs from file, one per line,
performing an LDAP delete for each.</p>

<p>-x Use simple authentication instead of SASL.</p>

<p>-D binddn Use the Distinguished Name binddn to bind to
the LDAP directory. For SASL binds, the server is expected
to ignore this value.</p>

<p>-W Prompt for simple authentication. This is used
instead of spec- ifying the password on the command
line.</p>

<p>-w passwd Use passwd as the password for simple
authentication.</p>

<p>-y passwdfile Use complete contents of passwdfile as the
password for simple authentication.</p>

<p>-H ldapuri Specify URI(s) referring to the ldap
server(s); only the proto- col/host/port fields are allowed;
a list of URI, separated by whitespace or commas is
expected.</p>

<p>-h ldaphost Specify an alternate host on which the ldap
server is running. Deprecated in favor of -H.</p>

<p>-p ldapport Specify an alternate TCP port where the ldap
server is listen- ing. Deprecated in favor of -H.</p>

<p>-P {2|3} Specify the LDAP protocol version to use.</p>

<p>-e [!]ext[=extparam]</p>

<p>-E [!]ext[=extparam]</p>

<p>Specify general extensions with -e and search extensions
with -E. &acute;!&acute; indicates criticality.</p>

<p>General extensions: [!]assert=&lt;filter&gt; (an RFC
4515 Filter) [!]authzid=&lt;authzid&gt;
(&quot;dn:&lt;dn&gt;&quot; or &quot;u:&lt;user&gt;&quot;)
[!]manageDSAit [!]noop ppolicy [!]postread[=&lt;attrs&gt;]
(a comma-separated attribute list)
[!]preread[=&lt;attrs&gt;] (a comma-separated attribute
list) abandon, cancel (SIGINT sends abandon/cancel; not
really controls)</p>

<p>Search extensions: [!]domainScope (domain scope)
[!]mv=&lt;filter&gt; (matched values filter)
[!]pr=&lt;size&gt;[/prompt|noprompt] (paged results/prompt)
[!]sss=[-]&lt;attr[:OID]&gt;[/[-]&lt;attr[:OID]&gt;...]
(server side sorting) [!]subentries[=true|false]
(subentries) [!]sync=ro[/&lt;cookie&gt;] (LDAP Sync
refreshOnly) rp[/&lt;cookie&gt;][/&lt;slimit&gt;] (LDAP Sync
refreshAndPersist)</p>

<p>-r Do a recursive delete. If the DN specified isnt a
leaf, its children, and all their children are deleted down
the tree. No verification is done, so if you add this
switch, ldapdelete will happily delete large portions of
your tree. Use with care.</p>

<p>-z sizelimit Use sizelimit when searching for children
DN to delete, to cir- cumvent any server-side size limit.
Only useful in conjunction with -r.</p>

<p>-O security-properties Specify SASL security
properties.</p>

<p>-I Enable SASL Interactive mode. Always prompt. Default
is to prompt only as needed.</p>

<p>-Q Enable SASL Quiet mode. Never prompt.</p>

<p>-U authcid Specify the authentication ID for SASL bind.
The form of the identity depends on the actual SASL
mechanism used.</p>

<p>-R realm Specify the realm of authentication ID for SASL
bind. The form of the realm depends on the actual SASL
mechanism used.</p>

<p>-X authzid Specify the requested authorization ID for
SASL bind. authzid must be one of the following formats:
dn:&lt;distinguished name&gt; or u:&lt;username&gt;</p>

<p>-Y mech Specify the SASL mechanism to be used for
authentication. If its not specified, the program will
choose the best mechanism the server knows.</p>

<p>-Z[Z] Issue StartTLS (Transport Layer Security) extended
operation. If you use -ZZ, the command will require the
operation to be suc- cessful.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE The following command:</p>

<p>ldapdelete &quot;cn=Delete
Me,dc=example,dc=com&quot;</p>

<p>will attempt to delete the entry named &quot;cn=Delete
Me,dc=exam- ple,dc=com&quot;. Of course it would probably be
necessary to supply authentication credentials.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS Exit status is 0 if no errors occur. Errors
result in a non-zero exit status and a diagnostic message
being written to standard error.</p>
