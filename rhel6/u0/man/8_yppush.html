<p>NAME yppush - force propagation of changed NIS
databases</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS /usr/sbin/yppush [ -d domain ] [ -t timeout ] [
--parallel # | --port port ] [ -h host ] [ -v ] mapname
...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION yppush copies updated NIS databases (or
maps) from the master NIS server to the slave servers within
a NIS domain. It is normally run only on the NIS master by
/var/yp/Makefile after the master databases are changed.
/var/yp/Makefile does not invoke yppush by default, the
NOPUSH=true line must be commented out. yppush first
constructs a list of NIS slave servers by reading the NIS
map ypservers within the domain. A destination host (or a
list of hosts with multiple -h commands) can also be
specified on the command line. A &quot;transfer map&quot;
request is sent to the NIS serger at each slave, along with
the information needed by the transfer agent ypxfr(8) to
callback to yppush, which may be printed the result to
stderr. Mes- sages are also printed when a transfer is not
possible; for instance when the request message is
undeliverable.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -d domain Specify a particular domain. The NIS
domain of the local host system is used by default. If the
local hosts domain name is not set, the domain name must be
specified with this flag.</p>

<p>-t timeout The timeout flag is used to specify a timeout
value in seconds. This timeout controls how long yppush will
wait for a response from a slave server before sending a map
transfer request to the next slave server in the list. By
default, yppush will wait 90 seconds. For big maps, this is
not long enough.</p>

<p>--parallel #, -p # yppush normally performs transfers
serially, meaning that it will send a map transfer request
to one slave server and then wait for it to respond before
sending the next map transfer request to the next slave
server. In environments with many slaves, it is more
efficient to initiate several map transfers at once so that
the transfers can take place in parallel. It is not possible
to run in parallel and assign a fixed port with the --port
flag</p>

<p>--port port specify a port for yppush to listen on. By
default, yppush will ask portmap(8) to assign it a random
port number. It is not possible to assign a port with this
option and run in paral- lel with the --parallel or -p
flag</p>

<p>-h host The host flag can be used to transfer a map to a
user-specified machine or group of machines instead of the
list of servers con- tained in the ypservers map. A list of
hosts can be specified by using multiple instances of the -h
flag.</p>

<p>-v Verbose mode: causes yppush to print debugging
messages as it runs. Note specifying this flag twice makes
yppush even more verbose.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO domainname(1), ypserv(8), ypxfr(8)</p>

<p>BUGS The mechanism for transferring NIS maps in NIS v1
is different that that in NIS version 2. This version of
yppush has support for transfer- ring maps to NIS v2 systems
only.</p>
