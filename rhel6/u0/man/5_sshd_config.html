<p>SSHD_CONFIG(5) BSD File Formats Manual
SSHD_CONFIG(5)</p>

<p>NAME sshd_config - OpenSSH SSH daemon configuration
file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS /etc/ssh/sshd_config</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION sshd(8) reads configuration data from
/etc/ssh/sshd_config (or the file specified with -f on the
command line). The file contains keyword-argu- ment pairs,
one per line. Lines starting with # and empty lines are
interpreted as comments. Arguments may optionally be
enclosed in double quotes (&quot;) in order to represent
arguments containing spaces.</p>

<p>The possible keywords and their meanings are as follows
(note that key- words are case-insensitive and arguments are
case-sensitive):</p>

<p>AcceptEnv Specifies what environment variables sent by
the client will be copied into the sessions environ(7). See
SendEnv in ssh_config(5) for how to configure the client.
Note that envi- ronment passing is only supported for
protocol 2. Variables are specified by name, which may
contain the wildcard characters * and ? . Multiple
environment variables may be separated by whitespace or
spread across multiple AcceptEnv directives. Be warned that
some environment variables could be used to bypass
restricted user environments. For this reason, care should
be taken in the use of this directive. The default is not to
accept any environment variables.</p>

<p>AddressFamily Specifies which address family should be
used by sshd(8). Valid arguments are any, inet (use IPv4
only), or inet6 (use IPv6 only). The default is any.</p>

<p>AllowAgentForwarding Specifies whether ssh-agent(1)
forwarding is permitted. The default is yes . Note that
disabling agent forwarding does not improve security unless
users are also denied shell access, as they can always
install their own forwarders.</p>

<p>AllowGroups This keyword can be followed by a list of
group name patterns, separated by spaces. If specified,
login is allowed only for users whose primary group or
supplementary group list matches one of the patterns. Only
group names are valid; a numerical group ID is not
recognized. By default, login is allowed for all groups. The
allow/deny directives are processed in the following order:
DenyUsers, AllowUsers, DenyGroups, and finally
AllowGroups.</p>

<p>See PATTERNS in ssh_config(5) for more information on
patterns.</p>

<p>AllowTcpForwarding Specifies whether TCP forwarding is
permitted. The default is yes . Note that disabling TCP
forwarding does not improve secu- rity unless users are also
denied shell access, as they can always install their own
forwarders.</p>

<p>AllowUsers This keyword can be followed by a list of
user name patterns, separated by spaces. If specified, login
is allowed only for user names that match one of the
patterns. Only user names are valid; a numerical user ID is
not recognized. By default, login is allowed for all users.
If the pattern takes the form USER@HOST then USER and HOST
are separately checked, restricting logins to particular
users from particular hosts. The allow/deny directives are
processed in the following order: DenyUsers, AllowUsers,
DenyGroups, and finally AllowGroups.</p>

<p>See PATTERNS in ssh_config(5) for more information on
patterns.</p>

<p>AuthorizedKeysFile Specifies the file that contains the
public keys that can be used for user authentication.
AuthorizedKeysFile may contain tokens of the form %T which
are substituted during connection setup. The following
tokens are defined: %% is replaced by a literal %, %h is
replaced by the home directory of the user being
authenticated, and %u is replaced by the username of that
user. After expansion, AuthorizedKeysFile is taken to be an
absolute path or one relative to the users home directory.
The default is .ssh/authorized_keys.</p>

<p>Banner The contents of the specified file are sent to
the remote user before authentication is allowed. If the
argument is none then no banner is displayed. This option is
only available for proto- col version 2. By default, no
banner is displayed.</p>

<p>ChallengeResponseAuthentication Specifies whether
challenge-response authentication is allowed (e.g. via PAM
or though authentication styles supported in login.conf(5))
The default is yes.</p>

<p>ChrootDirectory Specifies a path to chroot(2) to after
authentication. This path, and all its components, must be
root-owned directories that are not writable by any other
user or group. After the chroot, sshd(8) changes the working
directory to the users home direc- tory.</p>

<p>The path may contain the following tokens that are
expanded at runtime once the connecting user has been
authenticated: %% is replaced by a literal %, %h is replaced
by the home directory of the user being authenticated, and
%u is replaced by the user- name of that user.</p>

<p>The ChrootDirectory must contain the necessary files and
directo- ries to support the user s session. For an
interactive session this requires at least a shell,
typically sh(1), and basic /dev nodes such as null(4),
zero(4), stdin(4), stdout(4), stderr(4), arandom(4) and
tty(4) devices. For file transfer sessions using sftp, no
additional configuration of the environment is neces- sary
if the in-process sftp server is used, though sessions which
use logging do require /dev/log inside the chroot directory
(see sftp-server(8) for details).</p>

<p>The default is not to chroot(2).</p>

<p>Ciphers Specifies the ciphers allowed for protocol
version 2. Multiple ciphers must be comma-separated. The
supported ciphers are 3des-cbc, aes128-cbc, aes192-cbc,
aes256-cbc, aes128-ctr, aes192-ctr, aes256-ctr, arcfour128,
arcfour256, arcfour, blowfish-cbc, and cast128-cbc . The
default is:</p>

<p>aes128-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes256-ctr,arcfour256,arcfour128,
aes128-cbc,3des-cbc,blowfish-cbc,cast128-cbc,aes192-cbc,
aes256-cbc,arcfour</p>

<p>ClientAliveCountMax Sets the number of client alive
messages (see below) which may be sent without sshd(8)
receiving any messages back from the client. If this
threshold is reached while client alive messages are being
sent, sshd will disconnect the client, terminating the ses-
sion. It is important to note that the use of client alive
mes- sages is very different from TCPKeepAlive (below). The
client alive messages are sent through the encrypted channel
and there- fore will not be spoofable. The TCP keepalive
option enabled by TCPKeepAlive is spoofable. The client
alive mechanism is valu- able when the client or server
depend on knowing when a connec- tion has become
inactive.</p>

<p>The default value is 3. If ClientAliveInterval (see
below) is set to 15, and ClientAliveCountMax is left at the
default, unre- sponsive SSH clients will be disconnected
after approximately 45 seconds. This option applies to
protocol version 2 only.</p>

<p>ClientAliveInterval Sets a timeout interval in seconds
after which if no data has been received from the client,
sshd(8) will send a message through the encrypted channel to
request a response from the client. The default is 0,
indicating that these messages will not be sent to the
client. This option applies to protocol ver- sion 2
only.</p>

<p>Compression Specifies whether compression is allowed, or
delayed until the user has authenticated successfully. The
argument must be yes, delayed, or no. The default is
delayed.</p>

<p>DenyGroups This keyword can be followed by a list of
group name patterns, separated by spaces. Login is
disallowed for users whose primary group or supplementary
group list matches one of the patterns. Only group names are
valid; a numerical group ID is not recog- nized. By default,
login is allowed for all groups. The allow/deny directives
are processed in the following order: DenyUsers, AllowUsers,
DenyGroups, and finally AllowGroups.</p>

<p>See PATTERNS in ssh_config(5) for more information on
patterns.</p>

<p>DenyUsers This keyword can be followed by a list of user
name patterns, separated by spaces. Login is disallowed for
user names that match one of the patterns. Only user names
are valid; a numeri- cal user ID is not recognized. By
default, login is allowed for all users. If the pattern
takes the form USER@HOST then USER and HOST are separately
checked, restricting logins to particular users from
particular hosts. The allow/deny directives are pro- cessed
in the following order: DenyUsers, AllowUsers, DenyGroups,
and finally AllowGroups.</p>

<p>See PATTERNS in ssh_config(5) for more information on
patterns.</p>

<p>ForceCommand Forces the execution of the command
specified by ForceCommand, ignoring any command supplied by
the client and ~/.ssh/rc if present. The command is invoked
by using the users login shell with the -c option. This
applies to shell, command, or subsystem execution. It is
most useful inside a Match block. The command originally
supplied by the client is available in the
SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND environment variable. Specifying a
command of internal-sftp will force the use of an in-process
sftp server that requires no support files when used with
ChrootDirectory.</p>

<p>GatewayPorts Specifies whether remote hosts are allowed
to connect to ports forwarded for the client. By default,
sshd(8) binds remote port forwardings to the loopback
address. This prevents other remote hosts from connecting to
forwarded ports. GatewayPorts can be used to specify that
sshd should allow remote port forwardings to bind to
non-loopback addresses, thus allowing other hosts to con-
nect. The argument may be no to force remote port
forwardings to be available to the local host only, yes to
force remote port forwardings to bind to the wildcard
address, or clientspecified to allow the client to select
the address to which the forwarding is bound. The default is
no.</p>

<p>GSSAPIAuthentication Specifies whether user
authentication based on GSSAPI is allowed. The default is
no. Note that this option applies to protocol version 2
only.</p>

<p>GSSAPIKeyExchange Specifies whether key exchange based
on GSSAPI is allowed. GSSAPI key exchange doesnt rely on ssh
keys to verify host identity. The default is no. Note that
this option applies to protocol version 2 only.</p>

<p>GSSAPICleanupCredentials Specifies whether to
automatically destroy the users credentials cache on logout.
The default is yes . Note that this option applies to
protocol version 2 only.</p>

<p>GSSAPIStrictAcceptorCheck Determines whether to be
strict about the identity of the GSSAPI acceptor a client
authenticates against. If yes then the client must
authenticate against the host service on the current host-
name. If no then the client may authenticate against any
ser- vice key stored in the machines default store. This
facility is provided to assist with operation on multi homed
machines. The default is yes. Note that this option applies
only to protocol version 2 GSSAPI connections, and setting
it to no may only work with recent Kerberos GSSAPI
libraries.</p>

<p>GSSAPIStoreCredentialsOnRekey Controls whether the users
GSSAPI credentials should be updated following a successful
connection rekeying. This option can be used to accepted
renewed or updated credentials from a compatible client. The
default is no.</p>

<p>HostbasedAuthentication Specifies whether rhosts or
/etc/hosts.equiv authentication together with successful
public key client host authentication is allowed (host-based
authentication). This option is similar to
RhostsRSAAuthentication and applies to protocol version 2
only. The default is no.</p>

<p>HostbasedUsesNameFromPacketOnly Specifies whether or not
the server will attempt to perform a reverse name lookup
when matching the name in the ~/.shosts, ~/.rhosts, and
/etc/hosts.equiv files during HostbasedAuthentication. A
setting of yes means that sshd(8) uses the name supplied by
the client rather than attempting to resolve the name from
the TCP connection itself. The default is no.</p>

<p>HostKey Specifies a file containing a private host key
used by SSH. The default is /etc/ssh/ssh_host_key for
protocol version 1, and /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key and
/etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key for pro- tocol version 2. Note
that sshd(8) will refuse to use a file if it is
group/world-accessible. It is possible to have multiple host
key files. rsa1 keys are used for version 1 and dsa or rsa
are used for version 2 of the SSH protocol.</p>

<p>IgnoreRhosts Specifies that .rhosts and .shosts files
will not be used in RhostsRSAAuthentication or
HostbasedAuthentication.</p>

<p>/etc/hosts.equiv and /etc/ssh/shosts.equiv are still
used. The default is yes.</p>

<p>IgnoreUserKnownHosts Specifies whether sshd(8) should
ignore the users ~/.ssh/known_hosts during
RhostsRSAAuthentication or HostbasedAuthentication. The
default is no.</p>

<p>KerberosAuthentication Specifies whether the password
provided by the user for PasswordAuthentication will be
validated through the Kerberos KDC. To use this option, the
server needs a Kerberos servtab which allows the
verification of the KDCs identity. The default is no.</p>

<p>KerberosGetAFSToken If AFS is active and the user has a
Kerberos 5 TGT, attempt to acquire an AFS token before
accessing the users home directory. The default is no.</p>

<p>KerberosOrLocalPasswd If password authentication through
Kerberos fails then the pass- word will be validated via any
additional local mechanism such as /etc/passwd. The default
is yes.</p>

<p>KerberosTicketCleanup Specifies whether to automatically
destroy the users ticket cache file on logout. The default
is yes.</p>

<p>KeyRegenerationInterval In protocol version 1, the
ephemeral server key is automatically regenerated after this
many seconds (if it has been used). The purpose of
regeneration is to prevent decrypting captured ses- sions by
later breaking into the machine and stealing the keys. The
key is never stored anywhere. If the value is 0, the key is
never regenerated. The default is 3600 (seconds).</p>

<p>ListenAddress Specifies the local addresses sshd(8)
should listen on. The fol- lowing forms may be used:</p>

<p>ListenAddress host|IPv4_addr|IPv6_addr ListenAddress
host|IPv4_addr:port ListenAddress [host|IPv6_addr]:port</p>

<p>If port is not specified, sshd will listen on the
address and all prior Port options specified. The default is
to listen on all local addresses. Multiple ListenAddress
options are permitted. Additionally, any Port options must
precede this option for non- port qualified addresses.</p>

<p>LoginGraceTime The server disconnects after this time if
the user has not suc- cessfully logged in. If the value is
0, there is no time limit. The default is 120 seconds.</p>

<p>LogLevel Gives the verbosity level that is used when
logging messages from sshd(8). The possible values are:
QUIET, FATAL, ERROR, INFO, VERBOSE, DEBUG, DEBUG1, DEBUG2,
and DEBUG3. The default is INFO. DEBUG and DEBUG1 are
equivalent. DEBUG2 and DEBUG3 each specify higher levels of
debugging output. Logging with a DEBUG level violates the
privacy of users and is not recommended.</p>

<p>MACs Specifies the available MAC (message authentication
code) algo- rithms. The MAC algorithm is used in protocol
version 2 for data integrity protection. Multiple algorithms
must be comma-sepa- rated. The default is:</p>

<p>hmac-md5,hmac-sha1,umac-64@openssh.com,
hmac-ripemd160,hmac-sha1-96,hmac-md5-96</p>

<p>Match Introduces a conditional block. If all of the
criteria on the Match line are satisfied, the keywords on
the following lines override those set in the global section
of the config file, until either another Match line or the
end of the file.</p>

<p>The arguments to Match are one or more criteria-pattern
pairs. The available criteria are User, Group, Host, and
Address. The match patterns may consist of single entries or
comma-separated lists and may use the wildcard and negation
operators described in the PATTERNS section of
ssh_config(5).</p>

<p>The patterns in an Address criteria may additionally
contain addresses to match in CIDR address/masklen format,
e.g. 192.0.2.0/24 or 3ffe:ffff::/32. Note that the mask
length provided must be consistent with the address - it is
an error to specify a mask length that is too long for the
address or one with bits set in this host portion of the
address. For example, 192.0.2.0/33 and 192.0.2.0/8
respectively.</p>

<p>Only a subset of keywords may be used on the lines
following a Match keyword. Available keywords are
AllowAgentForwarding, AllowTcpForwarding, Banner,
ChrootDirectory, ForceCommand, GatewayPorts,
GSSAPIAuthentication, HostbasedAuthentication,
KbdInteractiveAuthentication, KerberosAuthentication,
MaxAuthTries, MaxSessions, PubkeyAuthentication,
AuthorizedKeysCommand, AuthorizedKeysCommandRunAs,
PasswordAuthentication, PermitEmptyPasswords, PermitOpen,
PermitRootLogin, RhostsRSAAuthentication, RSAAuthentication,
X11DisplayOffset, X11Forwarding and X11UseLocalHost.</p>

<p>MaxAuthTries Specifies the maximum number of
authentication attempts permitted per connection. Once the
number of failures reaches half this value, additional
failures are logged. The default is 6.</p>

<p>MaxSessions Specifies the maximum number of open
sessions permitted per net- work connection. The default is
10.</p>

<p>MaxStartups Specifies the maximum number of concurrent
unauthenticated con- nections to the SSH daemon. Additional
connections will be dropped until authentication succeeds or
the LoginGraceTime expires for a connection. The default is
10.</p>

<p>Alternatively, random early drop can be enabled by
specifying the three colon separated values start:rate:full
(e.g. &quot;10:30:60&quot;). sshd(8) will refuse connection
attempts with a probability of rate/100 (30%) if there are
currently start (10) unauthenti- cated connections. The
probability increases linearly and all connection attempts
are refused if the number of unauthenticated connections
reaches full (60).</p>

<p>PasswordAuthentication Specifies whether password
authentication is allowed. The default is yes.</p>

<p>PermitEmptyPasswords When password authentication is
allowed, it specifies whether the server allows login to
accounts with empty password strings. The default is no.</p>

<p>PermitOpen Specifies the destinations to which TCP port
forwarding is per- mitted. The forwarding specification must
be one of the follow- ing forms:</p>

<p>PermitOpen host:port PermitOpen IPv4_addr:port
PermitOpen [IPv6_addr]:port</p>

<p>Multiple forwards may be specified by separating them
with whitespace. An argument of any can be used to remove
all restrictions and permit any forwarding requests. By
default all port forwarding requests are permitted.</p>

<p>PermitRootLogin Specifies whether root can log in using
ssh(1). The argument must be yes, without-password,
forced-commands-only, or no. The default is yes.</p>

<p>If this option is set to without-password, password
authentica- tion is disabled for root.</p>

<p>If this option is set to forced-commands-only, root
login with public key authentication will be allowed, but
only if the command option has been specified (which may be
useful for taking remote backups even if root login is
normally not allowed). All other authentication methods are
disabled for root.</p>

<p>If this option is set to no, root is not allowed to log
in.</p>

<p>PermitTunnel Specifies whether tun(4) device forwarding
is allowed. The argu- ment must be yes, point-to-point
(layer 3), ethernet (layer 2), or no . Specifying yes
permits both point-to-point and ethernet. The default is
no.</p>

<p>PermitUserEnvironment Specifies whether
~/.ssh/environment and environment= options in
~/.ssh/authorized_keys are processed by sshd(8). The default
is no. Enabling environment processing may enable users to
bypass access restrictions in some configurations using
mechanisms such as LD_PRELOAD.</p>

<p>PidFile Specifies the file that contains the process ID
of the SSH dae- mon. The default is /var/run/sshd.pid.</p>

<p>Port Specifies the port number that sshd(8) listens on.
The default is 22. Multiple options of this type are
permitted. See also ListenAddress.</p>

<p>PrintLastLog Specifies whether sshd(8) should print the
date and time of the last user login when a user logs in
interactively. The default is yes.</p>

<p>PrintMotd Specifies whether sshd(8) should print
/etc/motd when a user logs in interactively. (On some
systems it is also printed by the shell, /etc/profile, or
equivalent.) The default is yes.</p>

<p>Protocol Specifies the protocol versions sshd(8)
supports. The possible values are 1 and 2. Multiple versions
must be comma-sepa- rated. The default is 2,1. Note that the
order of the proto- col list does not indicate preference,
because the client selects among multiple protocol versions
offered by the server. Specify- ing 2,1 is identical to
1,2.</p>

<p>PubkeyAuthentication Specifies whether public key
authentication is allowed. The default is yes. Note that
this option applies to protocol ver- sion 2 only.</p>

<p>AuthorizedKeysCommand Specifies a program to be used for
lookup of the users public keys. The program will be invoked
with its first argument the name of the user being
authorized, and should produce on standard output
AuthorizedKeys lines (see AUTHORIZED_KEYS in sshd(8)). By
default (or when set to the empty string) there is no
Authorized- KeysCommand run. If the AuthorizedKeysCommand
does not success- fully authorize the user, authorization
falls through to the AuthorizedKeysFile. Note that this
option has an effect only with PubkeyAuthentication turned
on.</p>

<p>AuthorizedKeysCommandRunAs Specifies the user under
whose account the AuthorizedKeysCommand is run. Empty string
(the default value) means the user being authorized is
used.</p>

<p>RhostsRSAAuthentication Specifies whether rhosts or
/etc/hosts.equiv authentication together with successful RSA
host authentication is allowed. The default is no . This
option applies to protocol version 1 only.</p>

<p>RSAAuthentication Specifies whether pure RSA
authentication is allowed. The default is yes . This option
applies to protocol version 1 only.</p>

<p>ServerKeyBits Defines the number of bits in the
ephemeral protocol version 1 server key. The minimum value
is 512, and the default is 1024.</p>

<p>ShowPatchLevel Specifies whether sshd will display the
patch level of the binary in the identification string. The
patch level is set at compile- time. The default is no. This
option applies to protocol ver- sion 1 only.</p>

<p>StrictModes Specifies whether sshd(8) should check file
modes and ownership of the user s files and home directory
before accepting login. This is normally desirable because
novices sometimes accidentally leave their directory or
files world-writable. The default is yes.</p>

<p>Subsystem Configures an external subsystem (e.g. file
transfer daemon). Arguments should be a subsystem name and a
command (with optional arguments) to execute upon subsystem
request.</p>

<p>The command sftp-server(8) implements the sftp file
transfer subsystem.</p>

<p>Alternately the name internal-sftp implements an
in-process sftp server. This may simplify configurations
using ChrootDirectory to force a different filesystem root
on clients.</p>

<p>By default no subsystems are defined. Note that this
option applies to protocol version 2 only.</p>

<p>SyslogFacility Gives the facility code that is used when
logging messages from sshd(8). The possible values are:
DAEMON, USER, AUTH, AUTHPRIV, LOCAL0, LOCAL1, LOCAL2,
LOCAL3, LOCAL4, LOCAL5, LOCAL6, LOCAL7. The default is
AUTH.</p>

<p>TCPKeepAlive Specifies whether the system should send
TCP keepalive messages to the other side. If they are sent,
death of the connection or crash of one of the machines will
be properly noticed. However, this means that connections
will die if the route is down tem- porarily, and some people
find it annoying. On the other hand, if TCP keepalives are
not sent, sessions may hang indefinitely on the server,
leaving ghost users and consuming server resources.</p>

<p>The default is yes (to send TCP keepalive messages), and
the server will notice if the network goes down or the
client host crashes. This avoids infinitely hanging
sessions.</p>

<p>To disable TCP keepalive messages, the value should be
set to no.</p>

<p>UseDNS Specifies whether sshd(8) should look up the
remote host name and check that the resolved host name for
the remote IP address maps back to the very same IP address.
The default is yes.</p>

<p>UseLogin Specifies whether login(1) is used for
interactive login ses- sions. The default is no. Note that
login(1) is never used for remote command execution. Note
also, that if this is enabled, X11Forwarding will be
disabled because login(1) does not know how to handle
xauth(1) cookies. If UsePrivilegeSeparation is specified, it
will be disabled after authentication.</p>

<p>UsePAM Enables the Pluggable Authentication Module
interface. If set to yes this will enable PAM authentication
using ChallengeResponseAuthentication and
PasswordAuthentication in addition to PAM account and
session module processing for all authentication types.</p>

<p>Because PAM challenge-response authentication usually
serves an equivalent role to password authentication, you
should disable either PasswordAuthentication or
ChallengeResponseAuthentication.</p>

<p>If UsePAM is enabled, you will not be able to run
sshd(8) as a non-root user. The default is no.</p>

<p>UsePrivilegeSeparation Specifies whether sshd(8)
separates privileges by creating an unprivileged child
process to deal with incoming network traffic. After
successful authentication, another process will be created
that has the privilege of the authenticated user. The goal
of privilege separation is to prevent privilege escalation
by con- taining any corruption within the unprivileged
processes. The default is yes.</p>

<p>X11DisplayOffset Specifies the first display number
available for sshd(8)s X11 forwarding. This prevents sshd
from interfering with real X11 servers. The default is
10.</p>

<p>X11Forwarding Specifies whether X11 forwarding is
permitted. The argument must be yes or no. The default is
no.</p>

<p>When X11 forwarding is enabled, there may be additional
exposure to the server and to client displays if the sshd(8)
proxy display is configured to listen on the wildcard
address (see X11UseLocalhost below), though this is not the
default. Addi- tionally, the authentication spoofing and
authentication data verification and substitution occur on
the client side. The security risk of using X11 forwarding
is that the clients X11 display server may be exposed to
attack when the SSH client requests forwarding (see the
warnings for ForwardX11 in ssh_config(5)). A system
administrator may have a stance in which they want to
protect clients that may expose themselves to attack by
unwittingly requesting X11 forwarding, which can war- rant a
no setting.</p>

<p>Note that disabling X11 forwarding does not prevent
users from forwarding X11 traffic, as users can always
install their own forwarders. X11 forwarding is
automatically disabled if UseLogin is enabled.</p>

<p>X11UseLocalhost Specifies whether sshd(8) should bind
the X11 forwarding server to the loopback address or to the
wildcard address. By default, sshd binds the forwarding
server to the loopback address and sets the hostname part of
the DISPLAY environment variable to localhost . This
prevents remote hosts from connecting to the proxy display.
However, some older X11 clients may not function with this
configuration. X11UseLocalhost may be set to no to specify
that the forwarding server should be bound to the wild- card
address. The argument must be yes or no. The default is
yes.</p>

<p>XAuthLocation Specifies the full pathname of the
xauth(1) program. The default is /usr/bin/xauth.</p>

<p>TIME FORMATS sshd(8) command-line arguments and
configuration file options that spec- ify time may be
expressed using a sequence of the form: time[qualifier],
where time is a positive integer value and qualifier is one
of the fol- lowing:</p>

<p>none seconds s | S seconds m | M minutes h | H hours d |
D days w | W weeks</p>

<p>Each member of the sequence is added together to
calculate the total time value.</p>

<p>Time format examples:</p>

<p>600 600 seconds (10 minutes) 10m 10 minutes 1h30m 1 hour
30 minutes (90 minutes)</p>

<p>FILES /etc/ssh/sshd_config Contains configuration data
for sshd(8). This file should be writable by root only, but
it is recommended (though not neces- sary) that it be
world-readable.</p>
