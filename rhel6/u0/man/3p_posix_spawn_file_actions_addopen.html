<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME posix_spawn_file_actions_addclose,
posix_spawn_file_actions_addopen - add close or open action
to spawn file actions object (ADVANCED REAL- TIME)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;spawn.h&gt;</p>

<p>int
posix_spawn_file_actions_addclose(posix_spawn_file_actions_t
* file_actions, int fildes); int
posix_spawn_file_actions_addopen(posix_spawn_file_actions_t
* restrict file_actions, int fildes, const char *restrict
path, int oflag, mode_t mode);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION These functions shall add or delete a close
or open action to a spawn file actions object.</p>

<p>A spawn file actions object is of type
posix_spawn_file_actions_t (defined in &lt;spawn.h&gt;) and
is used to specify a series of actions to be performed by a
posix_spawn() or posix_spawnp() operation in order to arrive
at the set of open file descriptors for the child process
given the set of open file descriptors of the parent. IEEE
Std 1003.1-2001 does not define comparison or assignment
operators for the type posix_spawn_file_actions_t.</p>

<p>A spawn file actions object, when passed to
posix_spawn() or posix_spawnp(), shall specify how the set
of open file descriptors in the calling process is
transformed into a set of potentially open file descriptors
for the spawned process. This transformation shall be as if
the specified sequence of actions was performed exactly
once, in the context of the spawned process (prior to
execution of the new process image), in the order in which
the actions were added to the object; additionally, when the
new process image is executed, any file descrip- tor (from
this new set) which has its FD_CLOEXEC flag set shall be
closed (see posix_spawn()).</p>

<p>The posix_spawn_file_actions_addclose() function shall
add a close action to the object referenced by file_actions
that shall cause the file descriptor fildes to be closed (as
if close( fildes) had been called) when a new process is
spawned using this file actions object.</p>

<p>The posix_spawn_file_actions_addopen() function shall
add an open action to the object referenced by file_actions
that shall cause the file named by path to be opened (as if
open( path, oflag, mode) had been called, and the returned
file descriptor, if not fildes, had been changed to fildes)
when a new process is spawned using this file actions
object. If fildes was already an open file descriptor, it
shall be closed before the new file is opened.</p>

<p>The string described by path shall be copied by the
posix_spawn_file_actions_addopen() function.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, these functions
shall return zero; other- wise, an error number shall be
returned to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS These functions shall fail if:</p>

<p>EBADF The value specified by fildes is negative or
greater than or equal to {OPEN_MAX}.</p>

<p>These functions may fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The value specified by file_actions is
invalid.</p>

<p>ENOMEM Insufficient memory exists to add to the spawn
file actions object.</p>

<p>It shall not be considered an error for the fildes
argument passed to these functions to specify a file
descriptor for which the specified operation could not be
performed at the time of the call. Any such error will be
detected when the associated file actions object is later
used during a posix_spawn() or posix_spawnp() operation.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE These functions are part of the Spawn
option and need not be provided on all implementations.</p>

<p>RATIONALE A spawn file actions object may be initialized
to contain an ordered sequence of close(), dup2(), and
open() operations to be used by posix_spawn() or
posix_spawnp() to arrive at the set of open file descriptors
inherited by the spawned process from the set of open file
descriptors in the parent at the time of the posix_spawn()
or posix_spawnp() call. It had been suggested that the
close() and dup2() operations alone are sufficient to
rearrange file descriptors, and that files which need to be
opened for use by the spawned process can be handled either
by having the calling process open them before the
posix_spawn() or posix_spawnp() call (and close them after),
or by passing filenames to the spawned process (in argv) so
that it may open them itself. The standard developers
recommend that applications use one of these two methods
when practical, since detailed error status on a failed open
operation is always available to the application this way.
However, the standard developers feel that allowing a spawn
file actions object to specify open operations is still
appropriate because:</p>

<p>1. It is consistent with equivalent POSIX.5 (Ada)
functionality.</p>

<p>2. It supports the I/O redirection paradigm commonly
employed by POSIX programs designed to be invoked from a
shell. When such a program is the child process, it may not
be designed to open files on its own.</p>

<p>3. It allows file opens that might otherwise fail or
violate file own- ership/access rights if executed by the
parent process.</p>

<p>Regarding 2. above, note that the spawn open file action
provides to posix_spawn() and posix_spawnp() the same
capability that the shell redirection operators provide to
system(), only without the intervening execution of a shell;
for example:</p>

<p>system (&quot;myprog &lt;file1 3&lt;file2&quot;);</p>

<p>Regarding 3. above, note that if the calling process
needs to open one or more files for access by the spawned
process, but has insufficient spare file descriptors, then
the open action is necessary to allow the open() to occur in
the context of the child process after other file
descriptors have been closed (that must remain open in the
parent).</p>

<p>Additionally, if a parent is executed from a file having
a &quot;set-user- id&quot; mode bit set and the
POSIX_SPAWN_RESETIDS flag is set in the spawn attributes, a
file created within the parent process will (possibly
incorrectly) have the parent s effective user ID as its
owner, whereas a file created via an open() action during
posix_spawn() or posix_spawnp() will have the parents real
ID as its owner; and an open by the parent process may
successfully open a file to which the real user should not
have access or fail to open a file to which the real user
should have access.</p>

<p>File Descriptor Mapping The standard developers had
originally proposed using an array which specified the
mapping of child file descriptors back to those of the
parent. It was pointed out by the ballot group that it is
not possible to reshuffle file descriptors arbitrarily in a
library implementation of posix_spawn() or posix_spawnp()
without provision for one or more spare file descriptor
entries (which simply may not be available). Such an array
requires that an implementation develop a complex strategy
to achieve the desired mapping without inadvertently closing
the wrong file descriptor at the wrong time.</p>

<p>It was noted by a member of the Ada Language Bindings
working group that the approved Ada Language Start_Process
family of POSIX process primitives use a caller-specified
set of file actions to alter the nor- mal fork()/ exec
semantics for inheritance of file descriptors in a very
flexible way, yet no such problems exist because the burden
of determining how to achieve the final file descriptor
mapping is com- pletely on the application. Furthermore,
although the file actions interface appears frightening at
first glance, it is actually quite simple to implement in
either a library or the kernel.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
