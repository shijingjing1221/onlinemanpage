I2O_DEVICE_CLAIM_REL(9)</p>

<p>NAME i2o_device_claim_release - release a device that
the OSM is using</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS int i2o_device_claim_release(struct i2o_device
* dev);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS dev device to release</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Drop a claim by an OSM on a given I2O
device.</p>

<p>AC - some devices seem to want to refuse an unclaim
until they have finished internal processing. It makes sense
since you don&acute;t want a new device to go reconfiguring
the entire system until you are done. Thus we are prepared
to wait briefly.</p>

<p>Returns 0 on success or negative error code on
failure.</p>
