<p>NAME htdigest - manage user files for digest
authentication</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS htdigest [ -c ] passwdfile realm username</p>

<p>SUMMARY htdigest is used to create and update the
flat-files used to store usernames, realm and password for
digest authentication of HTTP users. Resources available
from the Apache HTTP server can be restricted to just the
users listed in the files created by htdigest.</p>

<p>This manual page only lists the command line arguments.
For details of the directives necessary to configure digest
authentication in httpd see the Apache manual, which is part
of the Apache distribution or can be found at
http://httpd.apache.org/.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -c Create the passwdfile. If passwdfile already
exists, it is deleted first.</p>

<p>passwdfile Name of the file to contain the username,
realm and password. If -c is given, this file is created if
it does not already exist, or deleted and recreated if it
does exist.</p>

<p>realm The realm name to which the user name belongs.</p>

<p>username The user name to create or update in
passwdfile. If username does not exist is this file, an
entry is added. If it does exist, the password is
changed.</p>

<p>SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS This program is not safe as a
setuid executable. Do not make it setuid.</p>
