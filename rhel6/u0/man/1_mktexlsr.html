<p>NAME mktexlsr - create ls-R databases</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS mktexlsr [directories]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page is not meant to be
exhaustive. The complete documen- tation for this version of
TeX can be found in the info file or manual Kpathsea: A
library for path searching.</p>

<p>mktexlsr is used to generate the ls-R databases used by
the kpathsea library. It will create them for the specified
directories, or for a default list if no directories are
specified.</p>

<p>OPTIONS mktexlsr accepts the following options:</p>

<p>--help Print help message and exit.</p>

<p>--version Print version information and exit.</p>

<p>NOTES When called by root with no arguments, mktexlsr in
Debian ignores TEXMF trees under $HOME. This is to avoid
creating undesirable files such as /root/texmf/ls-R when
doing usual maintainance (it is generally a bad idea to work
with TeX as root, therefore having a file such as
/root/texmf/ls-R in the first place is rather pointless). If
you really want to update the ls-R databases for such TEXMF
trees, simply list them explicitely on the command-line.</p>
