<p>ROUTE(8) Linux Programmer s Manual ROUTE(8)</p>

<p>NAME route - show / manipulate the IP routing table</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS route [-CFvnee]</p>

<p>route [-v] [-A family] add [-net|-host] target [netmask
Nm] [gw Gw] [metric N] [mss M] [window W] [irtt I] [reject]
[mod] [dyn] [reinstate] [[dev] If]</p>

<p>route [-v] [-A family] del [-net|-host] target [gw Gw]
[netmask Nm] [metric N] [[dev] If]</p>

<p>route [-V] [--version] [-h] [--help]</p>

<p>NOTE This program is obsolete. For replacement check ip
route.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Route manipulates the kernel s IP routing
tables. Its primary use is to set up static routes to
specific hosts or networks via an interface after it has
been configured with the ifconfig(8) program.</p>

<p>When the add or del options are used, route modifies the
routing tables. Without these options, route displays the
current contents of the routing tables.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -A family use the specified address family (eg
inet; use route --help for a full list).</p>

<p>-F operate on the kernels FIB (Forwarding Information
Base) rout- ing table. This is the default.</p>

<p>-C operate on the kernels routing cache.</p>

<p>-v select verbose operation.</p>

<p>-n show numerical addresses instead of trying to
determine symbolic host names. This is useful if you are
trying to determine why the route to your nameserver has
vanished.</p>

<p>-e use netstat(8)-format for displaying the routing
table. -ee will generate a very long line with all
parameters from the routing table.</p>

<p>del delete a route.</p>

<p>add add a new route.</p>

<p>target the destination network or host. You can provide
IP addresses in dotted decimal or host/network names.</p>

<p>-net the target is a network.</p>

<p>-host the target is a host.</p>

<p>netmask NM when adding a network route, the netmask to
be used.</p>

<p>gw GW route packets via a gateway. NOTE: The specified
gateway must be reachable first. This usually means that you
have to set up a static route to the gateway beforehand. If
you specify the address of one of your local interfaces, it
will be used to decide about the interface to which the
packets should be routed to. This is a BSDism compatibility
hack.</p>

<p>metric M set the metric field in the routing table (used
by routing dae- mons) to M.</p>

<p>mss M set the TCP Maximum Segment Size (MSS) for
connections over this route to M bytes. The default is the
device MTU minus headers, or a lower MTU when path mtu
discovery occured. This setting can be used to force smaller
TCP packets on the other end when path mtu discovery does
not work (usually because of misconfigured firewalls that
block ICMP Fragmentation Needed)</p>

<p>window W set the TCP window size for connections over
this route to W bytes. This is typically only used on AX.25
networks and with drivers unable to handle back to back
frames.</p>

<p>irtt I set the initial round trip time (irtt) for TCP
connections over this route to I milliseconds (1-12000).
This is typically only used on AX.25 networks. If omitted
the RFC 1122 default of 300ms is used.</p>

<p>reject install a blocking route, which will force a
route lookup to fail. This is for example used to mask out
networks before using the default route. This is NOT for
firewalling.</p>

<p>mod, dyn, reinstate install a dynamic or modified route.
These flags are for diag- nostic purposes, and are generally
only set by routing daemons.</p>

<p>dev If force the route to be associated with the
specified device, as the kernel will otherwise try to
determine the device on its own (by checking already
existing routes and device specifications, and where the
route is added to). In most normal networks you wont need
this.</p>

<p>If dev If is the last option on the command line, the
word dev may be omitted, as its the default. Otherwise the
order of the route modifiers (metric - netmask - gw - dev)
doesn t matter.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES route add -net 127.0.0.0 adds the normal
loopback entry, using netmask 255.0.0.0 (class A net,
determined from the destination address) and associated with
the &quot;lo&quot; device (assuming this device was
prviously set up correctly with ifconfig(8)).</p>

<p>route add -net 192.56.76.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 dev
eth0 adds a route to the network 192.56.76.x via
&quot;eth0&quot;. The Class C netmask modifier is not really
necessary here because 192.* is a Class C IP address. The
word &quot;dev&quot; can be omitted here.</p>

<p>route add default gw mango-gw adds a default route
(which will be used if no other route matches). All packets
using this route will be gatewayed through
&quot;mango-gw&quot;. The device which will actually be used
for that route depends on how we can reach
&quot;mango-gw&quot; - the static route to
&quot;mango-gw&quot; will have to be set up before.</p>

<p>route add ipx4 sl0 Adds the route to the
&quot;ipx4&quot; host via the SLIP interface (assum- ing
that &quot;ipx4&quot; is the SLIP host).</p>

<p>route add -net 192.57.66.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw ipx4
This command adds the net &quot;192.57.66.x&quot; to be
gatewayed through the former route to the SLIP
interface.</p>

<p>route add -net 224.0.0.0 netmask 240.0.0.0 dev eth0 This
is an obscure one documented so people know how to do it.
This sets all of the class D (multicast) IP routes to go via
&quot;eth0&quot;. This is the correct normal configuration
line with a multicasting kernel.</p>

<p>route add -net 10.0.0.0 netmask 255.0.0.0 reject This
installs a rejecting route for the private network
&quot;10.x.x.x.&quot;</p>

<p>OUTPUT The output of the kernel routing table is
organized in the following columns</p>

<p>Destination The destination network or destination
host.</p>

<p>Gateway The gateway address or * if none set.</p>

<p>Genmask The netmask for the destination net;
255.255.255.255 for a host destination and 0.0.0.0 for the
default route.</p>

<p>Flags Possible flags include U (route is up) H (target
is a host) G (use gateway) R (reinstate route for dynamic
routing) D (dynamically installed by daemon or redirect) M
(modified from routing daemon or redirect) A (installed by
addrconf) C (cache entry) ! (reject route)</p>

<p>Metric The distance to the target (usually counted in
hops). It is not used by recent kernels, but may be needed
by routing dae- mons.</p>

<p>Ref Number of references to this route. (Not used in the
Linux ker- nel.)</p>

<p>Use Count of lookups for the route. Depending on the use
of -F and -C this will be either route cache misses (-F) or
hits (-C).</p>

<p>Iface Interface to which packets for this route will be
sent.</p>

<p>MSS Default maximum segement size for TCP connections
over this route.</p>

<p>Window Default window size for TCP connections over this
route.</p>

<p>irtt Initial RTT (Round Trip Time). The kernel uses this
to guess about the best TCP protocol parameters without
waiting on (pos- sibly slow) answers.</p>

<p>HH (cached only) The number of ARP entries and cached
routes that refer to the hardware header cache for the
cached route. This will be -1 if a hardware address is not
needed for the interface of the cached route (e.g. lo).</p>

<p>Arp (cached only) Whether or not the hardware address
for the cached route is up to date.</p>

<p>FILES /proc/net/ipv6_route /proc/net/route
/proc/net/rt_cache</p>

<p>HISTORY Route for Linux was originally written by Fred
N. van Kempen, &lt;waltje@uwalt.nl.mugnet.org&gt; and then
modified by Johannes Stille and Linus Torvalds for pl15.
Alan Cox added the mss and window options for Linux 1.1.22.
irtt support and merged with netstat from Bernd Ecken-
fels.</p>
