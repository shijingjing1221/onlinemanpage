<p>Tcl_StackChannel(3) Tcl Library Procedures
Tcl_StackChannel(3)</p>


<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME Tcl_StackChannel, Tcl_UnstackChannel,
Tcl_GetStackedChannel, Tcl_Get- TopChannel - manipulate
stacked I/O channels</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tcl.h&gt;</p>

<p>Tcl_Channel Tcl_StackChannel(interp, typePtr,
clientData, mask, channel)</p>

<p>int Tcl_UnstackChannel(interp, channel)</p>

<p>Tcl_Channel Tcl_GetStackedChannel(channel)</p>

<p>Tcl_Channel Tcl_GetTopChannel(channel)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS Tcl_Interp *interp (in) Interpreter for error
report- ing.</p>

<p>Tcl_ChannelType *typePtr (in) The new channel I/O
procedures to use for channel.</p>

<p>ClientData clientData (in) Arbitrary one-word value to
pass to channel I/O proce- dures.</p>

<p>int mask (in) Conditions under which channel will be
used: OR-ed combina- tion of TCL_READABLE, TCL_WRITABLE and
TCL_EXCEP- TION. This can be a subset of the operations
currently allowed on channel.</p>

<p>Tcl_Channel channel (in) An existing Tcl channel such as
returned by Tcl_CreateChan- nel.

<p>DESCRIPTION These functions are for use by extensions
that add processing layers to Tcl I/O channels. Examples
include compression and encryption modules. These functions
transparently stack and unstack a new channel on top of an
existing one. Any number of channels can be stacked
together.</p>

<p>The implementation of the Tcl channel code was rewritten
in 8.3.2 to correct some problems with the previous
implementation with regard to stacked channels. Anyone using
stacked channels or creating stacked channel drivers should
update to the new TCL_CHANNEL_VERSION_2 Tcl_ChannelType
structure. See Tcl_CreateChannel for details.</p>

<p>Tcl_StackChannel stacks a new channel on an existing
channel with the same name that was registered for channel
by Tcl_RegisterChannel.</p>

<p>Tcl_StackChannel works by creating a new channel
structure and placing itself on top of the channel stack.
EOL translation, encoding and buffering options are shared
between all channels in the stack. The hidden channel does
no buffering, newline translations, or character set
encoding. Instead, the buffering, newline translations, and
encod- ing functions all remain at the top of the channel
stack. A pointer to the new top channel structure is
returned. If an error occurs when stacking the channel, NULL
is returned instead.</p>

<p>The mask parameter specifies the operations that are
allowed on the new channel. These can be a subset of the
operations allowed on the origi- nal channel. For example, a
read-write channel may become read-only after the
Tcl_StackChannel call.</p>

<p>Closing a channel closes the channels stacked below it.
The close of stacked channels is executed in a way that
allows buffered data to be properly flushed.</p>

<p>Tcl_UnstackChannel reverses the process. The old channel
is associated with the channel name, and the processing
module added by Tcl_StackChannel is destroyed. If there is
no old channel, then Tcl_UnstackChannel is equivalent to
Tcl_Close. If an error occurs unstacking the channel,
TCL_ERROR is returned, otherwise TCL_OK is returned.</p>

<p>Tcl_GetTopChannel returns the top channel in the stack
of channels the supplied channel is part of.</p>

<p>Tcl_GetStackedChannel returns the channel in the stack
of channels which is just below the supplied channel.</p>
