<p>NAME shmat, shmdt - shared memory operations</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; #include
&lt;sys/shm.h&gt;</p>

<p>void *shmat(int shmid, const void *shmaddr, int
shmflg);</p>

<p>int shmdt(const void *shmaddr);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION shmat() attaches the shared memory segment
identified by shmid to the address space of the calling
process. The attaching address is speci- fied by shmaddr
with one of the following criteria:</p>

<p>If shmaddr is NULL, the system chooses a suitable
(unused) address at which to attach the segment.</p>

<p>If shmaddr isnt NULL and SHM_RND is specified in shmflg,
the attach occurs at the address equal to shmaddr rounded
down to the nearest mul- tiple of SHMLBA. Otherwise shmaddr
must be a page-aligned address at which the attach
occurs.</p>

<p>If SHM_RDONLY is specified in shmflg, the segment is
attached for read- ing and the process must have read
permission for the segment. Other- wise the segment is
attached for read and write and the process must have read
and write permission for the segment. There is no notion of
a write-only shared memory segment.</p>

<p>The (Linux-specific) SHM_REMAP flag may be specified in
shmflg to indi- cate that the mapping of the segment should
replace any existing map- ping in the range starting at
shmaddr and continuing for the size of the segment.
(Normally an EINVAL error would result if a mapping already
exists in this address range.) In this case, shmaddr must
not be NULL.</p>

<p>The brk(2) value of the calling process is not altered
by the attach. The segment will automatically be detached at
process exit. The same segment may be attached as a read and
as a read-write one, and more than once, in the processs
address space.</p>

<p>A successful shmat() call updates the members of the
shmid_ds structure (see shmctl(2)) associated with the
shared memory segment as follows:</p>

<p>shm_atime is set to the current time.</p>

<p>shm_lpid is set to the process-ID of the calling
process.</p>

<p>shm_nattch is incremented by one.</p>

<p>shmdt() detaches the shared memory segment located at
the address spec- ified by shmaddr from the address space of
the calling process. The to-be-detached segment must be
currently attached with shmaddr equal to the value returned
by the attaching shmat() call.</p>

<p>On a successful shmdt() call the system updates the
members of the shmid_ds structure associated with the shared
memory segment as fol- lows:</p>

<p>shm_dtime is set to the current time.</p>

<p>shm_lpid is set to the process-ID of the calling
process.</p>

<p>shm_nattch is decremented by one. If it becomes 0 and
the seg- ment is marked for deletion, the segment is
deleted.</p>

<p>After a fork(2) the child inherits the attached shared
memory segments.</p>

<p>After an execve(2) all attached shared memory segments
are detached from the process.</p>

<p>Upon _exit(2) all attached shared memory segments are
detached from the process.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success shmat() returns the address of
the attached shared memory segment; on error (void *) -1 is
returned, and errno is set to indicate the cause of the
error.</p>

<p>On success shmdt() returns 0; on error -1 is returned,
and errno is set to indicate the cause of the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS When shmat() fails, errno is set to one of the
following:</p>

<p>EACCES The calling process does not have the required
permissions for the requested attach type, and does not have
the CAP_IPC_OWNER capability.</p>

<p>EINVAL Invalid shmid value, unaligned (i.e., not
page-aligned and SHM_RND was not specified) or invalid
shmaddr value, or cant attach segment at shmaddr, or
SHM_REMAP was specified and shmaddr was NULL.</p>

<p>ENOMEM Could not allocate memory for the descriptor or
for the page tables.</p>

<p>When shmdt() fails, errno is set as follows:</p>

<p>EINVAL There is no shared memory segment attached at
shmaddr; or, shmaddr is not aligned on a page boundary.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO SVr4, POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>In SVID 3 (or perhaps earlier) the type of the shmaddr
argument was changed from char * into const void *, and the
returned type of shmat() from char * into void *. (Linux
libc4 and libc5 have the char * proto- types; glibc2 has
void *.)</p>

<p>NOTES Using shmat() with shmaddr equal to NULL is the
preferred, portable way of attaching a shared memory
segment. Be aware that the shared memory segment attached in
this way may be attached at different addresses in different
processes. Therefore, any pointers maintained within the
shared memory must be made relative (typically to the
starting address of the segment), rather than absolute.</p>

<p>On Linux, it is possible to attach a shared memory
segment even if it is already marked to be deleted. However,
POSIX.1-2001 does not spec- ify this behavior and many other
implementations do not support it.</p>

<p>The following system parameter affects shmat():</p>

<p>SHMLBA Segment low boundary address multiple. Must be
page aligned. For the current implementation the SHMLBA
value is PAGE_SIZE.</p>

<p>The implementation places no intrinsic limit on the
per-process maximum number of shared memory segments
(SHMSEG).</p>
