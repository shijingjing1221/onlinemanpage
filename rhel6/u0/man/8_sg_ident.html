<p>NAME sg_ident - sends a SCSI REPORT or SET IDENTIFYING
INFORMATION command</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sg_ident [--ascii] [--clear] [--help]
[--itype=IT] [--raw] [--set] [--verbose] [--version]
DEVICE</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Send a SCSI REPORT IDENTIFYING INFORMATION
or SET IDENTIFYING INFORMA- TION command to DEVICE. Prior to
SPC-4 (revision 7) these commands were called REPORT DEVICE
IDENTIFIER and SET DEVICE IDENTIFIER respectively. SCSI
devices that support these two commands allow users to write
(set) identifying information and report it back at some
later time. The information is persistent (i.e. stored on
some non-volatile medium within the SCSI device that will
survive a power outage).</p>

<p>Typically the space allocated for the information is
limited: SPC-4 (revision 7) states that for information type
0, the minimum length is 64 bytes and the maximum is 512
bytes. For other information types (1 to 126 inclusive) the
maximum length is 256 bytes. Also information types 1 to 126
(inclusive) should contain a null terminated UTF-8 string.
The author has seen older disks that only support 16
bytes.</p>

<p>The default action when no options are given is to
invoke the Report Identifying Information command with the
information type defaulting to zero. Error reports are sent
to stderr. By default the information is shown in ASCII-HEX
(up to 16 bytes per line) with an ASCII representa- tion to
the right with dots replacing non printable characters.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Arguments to long options are mandatory for
short options as well.</p>

<p>-A, --ascii invokes the Report Identifying Information
command and if any- thing is found interprets it as ASCII
(or UTF-8 depending on the locale) and prints the
information to stdout.</p>

<p>-C, --clear invokes the Set Identifying Information
command with an informa- tion length of zero. This has the
effect of clearing the exist- ing information.</p>

<p>-h, --help output the usage message then exit.</p>

<p>-i, --itype=IT where IT is the information type.
Defaults to zero. The maximum value is 127 which is special
and cannot be used with --set or --clear. The information
type of 127 (if supported) causes the REPORT IDENTIFYING
INFORMATION command to respond with a list of available
information types and their maximum lengths in bytes. The
odd numbered information types between 3 and 125 (inclusive)
are not to be used (as they clash with the SCC-2
standard).</p>

<p>-r, --raw invokes the Report Identifying information
command and if any- thing is found sends the information
(which may be binary) to stdout. Nothing else is sent to
stdout however error reports, if any, are sent to
stderr.</p>

<p>-S, --set first reads stdin until an EOF is detected
then invokes the Set Identifying Information command to set
what has been fetched from stdin as the information. The
amount of data read must be between 1 and 512 bytes length
(inclusive).</p>

<p>-v, --verbose increase the level of verbosity, (i.e.
debug output).</p>

<p>-V, --version print the version string and then
exit.</p>

<p>This utility permits users to write their own
identifying information to their SCSI devices. There are
several other types of descriptors (or designators) that the
user cannot change. These include the SCSI INQUIRY command
with its standard vendor and product identification strings
and the product revision level; plus the large amount of
infor- mation provided by the &quot;Device
Identification&quot; VPD page (see sg_vpd). There is also
the READ MEDIA SERIAL NUMBER command (see sg_rmsn). The
MMC-4 command set for CD and DVDs has a &quot;media serial
number&quot; feature (0x109) [and a &quot;logical unit
serial number&quot; feature]. These can be viewed with the
sg_get_config utility.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES First, to see if there is an existing
information whose format is unknown (for information type
0), use no options:</p>

<p># sg_ident /dev/sdb 00 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 30
1234567890</p>

<p>If it is ASCII then it can printed as such:</p>

<p># sg_ident --ascii /dev/sdb 1234567890</p>

<p>The information can be copied to a file, cleared and
then re-asserted with this sequence:</p>

<p># sg_ident --raw /dev/sdb &gt; t # sg_ident --clear
/dev/sdb # cat t | sg_ident --set /dev/sdb</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The exit status of sg_ident is 0 when it is
successful. Otherwise see the sg3_utils(8) man page.</p>
