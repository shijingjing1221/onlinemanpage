<p>NAME rt_sigprocmask - Change the list of currently
blocked signals</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS long sys_rt_sigprocmask (int how, sigset_t
*set, sigset_t *oset, size_t sigsetsize);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION rt_sigprocmask changes the list of currently
blocked signals. The set value stores the signal mask of the
pending signals. The previous ac- tion on the signal is
saved in oact. The value of how indicates how the call
should behave; its values are as follows:</p>

<p>SIG_BLOCK The set of blocked signals is the union of the
current set and the set argument.</p>

<p>SIG_UNBLOCK The signals in set are removed from the
current set of blocked signals. It is okay to unblock a
signal that is not blocked.</p>

<p>SIG_SETMASK The set of blocked signals is set to the set
argument. sigset- size should indicate the size of a
sigset_t type.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE rt_sigprocmask returns 0 on success;
otherwise, rt_sigprocmask returns one of the errors listed
in the &quot;Errors&quot; section.</p>

<p>ERRORS -EINVAL sigsetsize was not equivalent to the size
of a sigset_t type or the value specified in how was
invalid.</p>

<p>-EFAULT An invalid set, act, or oact was specified.</p>
