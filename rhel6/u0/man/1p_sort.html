<p>SORT(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual SORT(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME sort - sort, merge, or sequence check text
files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sort [-m][-o output][-bdfinru][-t char][-k
keydef]... [file...]</p>

<p>sort -c [-bdfinru][-t char][-k keydef][file]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sort utility shall perform one of the
following functions:</p>

<p>1. Sort lines of all the named files together and write
the result to the specified output.</p>

<p>2. Merge lines of all the named (presorted) files
together and write the result to the specified output.</p>

<p>3. Check that a single input file is correctly
presorted.</p>

<p>Comparisons shall be based on one or more sort keys
extracted from each line of input (or, if no sort keys are
specified, the entire line up to, but not including, the
terminating &lt;newline&gt;), and shall be per- formed using
the collating sequence of the current locale.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The sort utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines, and the -k keydef option should
follow the -b, -d, -f, -i, -n, and -r options.</p>

<p>The following options shall be supported:</p>

<p>-c Check that the single input file is ordered as
specified by the arguments and the collating sequence of the
current locale. No output shall be produced; only the exit
code shall be affected.</p>

<p>-m Merge only; the input file shall be assumed to be
already sorted.</p>

<p>-o output Specify the name of an output file to be used
instead of the standard output. This file can be the same as
one of the input files.</p>

<p>-u Unique: suppress all but one in each set of lines
having equal keys. If used with the -c option, check that
there are no lines with duplicate keys, in addition to
checking that the input file is sorted.</p>

<p>The following options shall override the default
ordering rules. When ordering options appear independent of
any key field specifications, the requested field ordering
rules shall be applied globally to all sort keys. When
attached to a specific key (see -k), the specified ordering
options shall override all global ordering options for that
key.</p>

<p>-d Specify that only &lt;blank&gt;s and alphanumeric
characters, accord- ing to the current setting of LC_CTYPE,
shall be significant in comparisons. The behavior is
undefined for a sort key to which -i or -n also applies.</p>

<p>-f Consider all lowercase characters that have uppercase
equiva- lents, according to the current setting of LC_CTYPE,
to be the uppercase equivalent for the purposes of
comparison.</p>

<p>-i Ignore all characters that are non-printable,
according to the current setting of LC_CTYPE.</p>

<p>-n Restrict the sort key to an initial numeric string,
consisting of optional &lt;blank&gt;s, optional minus sign,
and zero or more dig- its with an optional radix character
and thousands separators (as defined in the current locale),
which shall be sorted by arithmetic value. An empty digit
string shall be treated as zero. Leading zeros and signs on
zeros shall not affect order- ing.</p>

<p>-r Reverse the sense of comparisons.</p>

<p>The treatment of field separators can be altered using
the options:</p>

<p>-b Ignore leading &lt;blank&gt;s when determining the
starting and ending positions of a restricted sort key. If
the -b option is speci- fied before the first -k option, it
shall be applied to all -k options. Otherwise, the -b option
can be attached independently to each -k field_start or
field_end option-argument (see below).</p>

<p>-t char Use char as the field separator character; char
shall not be considered to be part of a field (although it
can be included in a sort key). Each occurrence of char
shall be significant (for example, &lt;char&gt;&lt;char&gt;
delimits an empty field). If -t is not specified,
&lt;blank&gt;s shall be used as default field separators;
each maximal non-empty sequence of &lt;blank&gt;s that
follows a non- &lt;blank&gt; shall be a field separator.</p>

<p>Sort keys can be specified using the options:</p>

<p>-k keydef The keydef argument is a restricted sort key
field definition. The format of this definition is:</p>

<p>field_start[type][,field_end[type]]</p>

<p>where field_start and field_end define a key field
restricted to a por- tion of the line (see the EXTENDED
DESCRIPTION section), and type is a modifier from the list
of characters,,,,,r. The b modifier shall behave like the -b
option, but shall apply only to the field_start or field_end
to which it is attached. The other modi- fiers shall behave
like the corresponding options, but shall apply only to the
key field to which they are attached; they shall have this
effect if specified with field_start, field_end, or both. If
any modi- fier is attached to a field_start or to a
field_end, no option shall apply to either. Implementations
shall support at least nine occur- rences of the -k option,
which shall be significant in command line order. If no -k
option is specified, a default sort key of the entire line
shall be used.</p>

<p>When there are multiple key fields, later keys shall be
compared only after all earlier keys compare equal. Except
when the -u option is specified, lines that otherwise
compare equal shall be ordered as if none of the options -d,
-f, -i, -n, or -k were present (but with -r still in effect,
if it was specified) and with all bytes in the lines
significant to the comparison. The order in which lines that
still com- pare equal are written is unspecified.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p>file A pathname of a file to be sorted, merged, or
checked. If no file operands are specified, or if a file
operand is, the standard input shall be used.</p>

<p>STDIN The standard input shall be used only if no file
operands are speci- fied, or if a file operand is-. See the
INPUT FILES section.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES The input files shall be text files, except
that the sort utility shall add a &lt;newline&gt; to the end
of a file ending with an incomplete last line.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of sort:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_COLLATE</p>

<p>Determine the locale for ordering rules.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments
and input files) and the behavior of character
classification for the -b, -d, -f, -i, and -n options.</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>LC_NUMERIC</p>

<p>Determine the locale for the definition of the radix
character and thousands separator for the -n option.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT Unless the -o or -c options are in effect, the
standard output shall contain the sorted input.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used for diagnostic
messages. A warning message about correcting an incomplete
last line of an input file may be generated, but need not
affect the final exit status.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES If the -o option is in effect, the sorted
input shall be written to the file output.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION The notation:</p>

<p>-k field_start[type][,field_end[type]]</p>

<p>shall define a key field that begins at field_start and
ends at field_end inclusive, unless field_start falls beyond
the end of the line or after field_end, in which case the
key field is empty. A miss- ing field_end shall mean the
last character of the line.</p>

<p>A field comprises a maximal sequence of non-separating
characters and, in the absence of option -t, any preceding
field separator.</p>

<p>The field_start portion of the keydef option-argument
shall have the form:</p>

<p>field_number[.first_character]</p>

<p>Fields and characters within fields shall be numbered
starting with 1. The field_number and first_character
pieces, interpreted as positive decimal integers, shall
specify the first character to be used as part of a sort
key. If .first_character is omitted, it shall refer to the
first character of the field.</p>

<p>The field_end portion of the keydef option-argument
shall have the form:</p>

<p>field_number[.last_character]</p>

<p>The field_number shall be as described above for
field_start. The last_character piece, interpreted as a
non-negative decimal integer, shall specify the last
character to be used as part of the sort key. If
last_character evaluates to zero or .last_character is
omitted, it shall refer to the last character of the field
specified by field_num- ber.</p>

<p>If the -b option or b type modifier is in effect,
characters within a field shall be counted from the first
non- &lt;blank&gt; in the field. (This shall apply
separately to first_character and last_character.)</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 All input files were output successfully, or -c was
specified and the input file was correctly sorted.</p>

<p>1 Under the -c option, the file was not ordered as
specified, or if the -c and -u options were both specified,
two input lines were found with equal keys.</p>

<p>&gt;1 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The default value for -t,
&lt;blank&gt;, has different properties from, for example,
-t &quot;&lt;space&gt;&quot;. If a line contains:</p>

<p>&lt;space&gt;&lt;space&gt;foo</p>

<p>the following treatment would occur with default
separation as opposed to specifically selecting a
&lt;space&gt;:</p>

<p>Field Default -t &quot;&lt;space&gt;&quot; 1
&lt;space&gt;&lt;space&gt;foo empty 2 empty empty 3 empty
foo</p>

<p>The leading field separator itself is included in a
field when -t is not used. For example, this command returns
an exit status of zero, meaning the input was already
sorted:</p>

<p>sort -c -k 2 &lt;&lt;eof y&lt;tab&gt;b x&lt;space&gt;a
eof</p>

<p>(assuming that a &lt;tab&gt; precedes the &lt;space&gt;
in the current collating sequence). The field separator is
not included in a field when it is explicitly set via -t.
This is historical practice and allows usage such as:</p>

<p>sort -t &quot;|&quot; -k 2n &lt;&lt;eof
Atlanta|425022|Georgia Birmingham|284413|Alabama
Columbia|100385|South Carolina eof</p>

<p>where the second field can be correctly sorted
numerically without regard to the non-numeric field
separator.</p>

<p>The wording in the OPTIONS section clarifies that the
-b, -d, -f, -i, -n, and -r options have to come before the
first sort key specified if they are intended to apply to
all specified keys. The way it is described in this volume
of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 matches historical practice, not
historical documentation. The results are unspecified if
these options are specified after a -k option.</p>

<p>The -f option might not work as expected in locales
where there is not a one-to-one mapping between an uppercase
and a lowercase letter.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES 1. The following command sorts the contents of
infile with the second field as the sort key:</p>

<p>sort -k 2,2 infile</p>

<p>2. The following command sorts, in reverse order, the
contents of infile1 and infile2, placing the output in
outfile and using the second character of the second field
as the sort key (assuming that the first character of the
second field is the field separator):</p>

<p>sort -r -o outfile -k 2.2,2.2 infile1 infile2</p>

<p>3. The following command sorts the contents of infile1
and infile2 using the second non- &lt;blank&gt; of the
second field as the sort key:</p>

<p>sort -k 2.2b,2.2b infile1 infile2</p>

<p>4. The following command prints the System V password
file (user database) sorted by the numeric user ID (the
third colon-separated field):</p>

<p>sort -t : -k 3,3n /etc/passwd</p>

<p>5. The following command prints the lines of the already
sorted file infile, suppressing all but one occurrence of
lines having the same third field:</p>

<p>sort -um -k 3.1,3.0 infile</p>

<p>RATIONALE Examples in some historical documentation
state that options -um with one input file keep the first in
each set of lines with equal keys. This behavior was deemed
to be an implementation artifact and was not
standardized.</p>

<p>The -z option was omitted; it is not standard practice
on most systems and is inconsistent with using sort to sort
several files individually and then merge them together. The
text concerning -z in historical doc- umentation appeared to
require implementations to determine the proper buffer
length during the sort phase of operation, but not during
the merge.</p>

<p>The -y option was omitted because of non-portability.
The -M option, present in System V, was omitted because of
non-portability in interna- tional usage.</p>

<p>An undocumented -T option exists in some
implementations. It is used to specify a directory for
intermediate files. Implementations are encouraged to
support the use of the TMPDIR environment variable instead
of adding an option to support this functionality.</p>

<p>The -k option was added to satisfy two objections.
First, the zero- based counting used by sort is not
consistent with other utility con- ventions. Second, it did
not meet syntax guideline requirements.</p>

<p>Historical documentation indicates that &quot;setting -n
implies -b&quot;. The description of -n already states that
optional leading &lt;blank&gt;s are tolerated in doing the
comparison. If -b is enabled, rather than implied, by -n,
this has unusual side effects. When a character offset is
used in a column of numbers (for example, to sort modulo
100), that offset is measured relative to the most
significant digit, not to the column. Based upon a
recommendation from the author of the original sort utility,
the -b implication has been omitted from this volume of IEEE
Std 1003.1-2001, and an application wishing to achieve the
previ- ously mentioned side effects has to code the -b flag
explicitly.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
