<p>L2PING(8) Linux System Administration L2PING(8)</p>

<p>NAME l2ping - Send L2CAP echo request and receive
answer</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS l2ping [-i &lt;hciX&gt;] [-s size] [-c count]
[-t timeout] [-d delay] [-f] [-r] [-v] bd_addr</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION L2ping sends a L2CAP echo request to the
Bluetooth MAC address bd_addr given in dotted hex
notation.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -i &lt;hciX&gt; The command is applied to device
hciX , which must be the name of an installed Bluetooth
device (X = 0, 1, 2, ...) If not specified, the command will
be sent to the first available Blue- tooth device.</p>

<p>-s size The size of the data packets to be sent.</p>

<p>-c count Send count number of packets then exit.</p>

<p>-t timeout Wait timeout seconds for the response.</p>

<p>-d delay Wait delay seconds between pings.</p>

<p>-f Kind of flood ping. Use with care! It reduces the
delay time between packets to 0.</p>

<p>-r Reverse ping (gnip?). Send echo response instead of
echo request.</p>

<p>-v Verify response payload is identical to request
payload. It is not required for remote stacks to return the
request payload, but most stacks do (including Bluez).</p>

<p>bd_addr The Bluetooth MAC address to be pinged in dotted
hex notation like 01:02:03:ab:cd:ef or 01:EF:cd:aB:02:03</p>
