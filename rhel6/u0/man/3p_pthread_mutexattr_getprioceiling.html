<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME pthread_mutexattr_getprioceiling,
pthread_mutexattr_setprioceiling - get and set the
prioceiling attribute of the mutex attributes object
(REALTIME THREADS)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;</p>

<p>int pthread_mutexattr_getprioceiling(const
pthread_mutexattr_t * restrict attr, int *restrict
prioceiling); int
pthread_mutexattr_setprioceiling(pthread_mutexattr_t *attr,
int prioceiling);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pthread_mutexattr_getprioceiling() and
pthread_mutexattr_setprio- ceiling() functions,
respectively, shall get and set the priority ceil- ing
attribute of a mutex attributes object pointed to by attr
which was previously created by the function
pthread_mutexattr_init().</p>

<p>The prioceiling attribute contains the priority ceiling
of initialized mutexes. The values of prioceiling are within
the maximum range of pri- orities defined by SCHED_FIFO.</p>

<p>The prioceiling attribute defines the priority ceiling
of initialized mutexes, which is the minimum priority level
at which the critical sec- tion guarded by the mutex is
executed. In order to avoid priority inversion, the priority
ceiling of the mutex shall be set to a priority higher than
or equal to the highest priority of all the threads that may
lock that mutex. The values of prioceiling are within the
maximum range of priorities defined under the SCHED_FIFO
scheduling policy.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, the
pthread_mutexattr_getprioceiling() and
pthread_mutexattr_setprioceiling() functions shall return
zero; other- wise, an error number shall be returned to
indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The pthread_mutexattr_getprioceiling() and
pthread_mutexattr_setprio- ceiling() functions may fail
if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The value specified by attr or prioceiling is
invalid.</p>

<p>EPERM The caller does not have the privilege to perform
the operation.</p>

<p>These functions shall not return an error code of
[EINTR].</p>
