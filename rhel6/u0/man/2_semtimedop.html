<p>NAME semop, semtimedop - semaphore operations</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; #include
&lt;sys/ipc.h&gt; #include &lt;sys/sem.h&gt;</p>

<p>int semop(int semid, struct sembuf *sops, unsigned
nsops);</p>

<p>int semtimedop(int semid, struct sembuf *sops, unsigned
nsops, struct timespec *timeout);</p>

<p>Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
feature_test_macros(7)):</p>

<p>semtimedop(): _GNU_SOURCE</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Each semaphore in a semaphore set has the
following associated values:</p>

<p>unsigned short semval; /* semaphore value */ unsigned
short semzcnt; /* # waiting for zero */ unsigned short
semncnt; /* # waiting for increase */ pid_t sempid; /*
process that did last op */</p>

<p>semop() performs operations on selected semaphores in
the set indicated by semid. Each of the nsops elements in
the array pointed to by sops specifies an operation to be
performed on a single semaphore. The ele- ments of this
structure are of type struct sembuf, containing the fol-
lowing members:</p>

<p>unsigned short sem_num; /* semaphore number */ short
sem_op; /* semaphore operation */ short sem_flg; /*
operation flags */</p>

<p>Flags recognized in sem_flg are IPC_NOWAIT and SEM_UNDO.
If an opera- tion specifies SEM_UNDO, it will be
automatically undone when the pro- cess terminates.</p>

<p>The set of operations contained in sops is performed in
array order, and atomically, that is, the operations are
performed either as a com- plete unit, or not at all. The
behavior of the system call if not all operations can be
performed immediately depends on the presence of the
IPC_NOWAIT flag in the individual sem_flg fields, as noted
below.</p>

<p>Each operation is performed on the sem_num-th semaphore
of the semaphore set, where the first semaphore of the set
is numbered 0. There are three types of operation,
distinguished by the value of sem_op.</p>

<p>If sem_op is a positive integer, the operation adds this
value to the semaphore value (semval). Furthermore, if
SEM_UNDO is specified for this operation, the system updates
the process undo count (semadj) for this semaphore. This
operation can always proceed it never forces a process to
wait. The calling process must have alter permission on the
semaphore set.</p>

<p>If sem_op is zero, the process must have read permission
on the semaphore set. This is a &quot;wait-for-zero&quot;
operation: if semval is zero, the operation can immediately
proceed. Otherwise, if IPC_NOWAIT is specified in sem_flg,
semop() fails with errno set to EAGAIN (and none of the
operations in sops is performed). Otherwise semzcnt (the
count of processes waiting until this semaphore s value
becomes zero) is incremented by one and the process sleeps
until one of the following occurs:</p>

<p>&middot; semval becomes 0, at which time the value of
semzcnt is decremented.</p>

<p>&middot; The semaphore set is removed: semop() fails,
with errno set to EIDRM.</p>

<p>&middot; The calling process catches a signal: the value
of semzcnt is decre- mented and semop() fails, with errno
set to EINTR.</p>

<p>&middot; The time limit specified by timeout in a
semtimedop() call expires: semop() fails, with errno set to
EAGAIN.</p>

<p>If sem_op is less than zero, the process must have alter
permission on the semaphore set. If semval is greater than
or equal to the absolute value of sem_op, the operation can
proceed immediately: the absolute value of sem_op is
subtracted from semval, and, if SEM_UNDO is speci- fied for
this operation, the system updates the process undo count
(semadj) for this semaphore. If the absolute value of sem_op
is greater than semval, and IPC_NOWAIT is specified in
sem_flg, semop() fails, with errno set to EAGAIN (and none
of the operations in sops is performed). Otherwise semncnt
(the counter of processes waiting for this semaphores value
to increase) is incremented by one and the pro- cess sleeps
until one of the following occurs:</p>

<p>&middot; semval becomes greater than or equal to the
absolute value of sem_op, at which time the value of semncnt
is decremented, the abso- lute value of sem_op is subtracted
from semval and, if SEM_UNDO is specified for this
operation, the system updates the process undo count
(semadj) for this semaphore.</p>

<p>&middot; The semaphore set is removed from the system:
semop() fails, with errno set to EIDRM.</p>

<p>&middot; The calling process catches a signal: the value
of semncnt is decre- mented and semop() fails, with errno
set to EINTR.</p>

<p>&middot; The time limit specified by timeout in a
semtimedop() call expires: the system call fails, with errno
set to EAGAIN.</p>

<p>On successful completion, the sempid value for each
semaphore specified in the array pointed to by sops is set
to the process ID of the calling process. In addition, the
sem_otime is set to the current time.</p>

<p>semtimedop() behaves identically to semop() except that
in those cases were the calling process would sleep, the
duration of that sleep is limited by the amount of elapsed
time specified by the timespec struc- ture whose address is
passed in the timeout argument. If the specified time limit
has been reached, semtimedop() fails with errno set to
EAGAIN (and none of the operations in sops is performed). If
the time- out argument is NULL, then semtimedop() behaves
exactly like semop().</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE If successful semop() and semtimedop()
return 0; otherwise they return -1 with errno indicating the
error.</p>

<p>ERRORS On failure, errno is set to one of the
following:</p>

<p>E2BIG The argument nsops is greater than SEMOPM, the
maximum number of operations allowed per system call.</p>

<p>EACCES The calling process does not have the permissions
required to perform the specified semaphore operations, and
does not have the CAP_IPC_OWNER capability.</p>

<p>EAGAIN An operation could not proceed immediately and
either IPC_NOWAIT was specified in sem_flg or the time limit
specified in timeout expired.</p>

<p>EFAULT An address specified in either the sops or the
timeout argument isnt accessible.</p>

<p>EFBIG For some operation the value of sem_num is less
than 0 or greater than or equal to the number of semaphores
in the set.</p>

<p>EIDRM The semaphore set was removed.</p>

<p>EINTR While blocked in this system call, the process
caught a signal; see signal(7).</p>

<p>EINVAL The semaphore set doesnt exist, or semid is less
than zero, or nsops has a non-positive value.</p>

<p>ENOMEM The sem_flg of some operation specified SEM_UNDO
and the system does not have enough memory to allocate the
undo structure.</p>

<p>ERANGE For some operation sem_op+semval is greater than
SEMVMX, the implementation dependent maximum value for
semval.</p>

<p>VERSIONS semtimedop() first appeared in Linux 2.5.52,
and was subsequently back- ported into kernel 2.4.22. Glibc
support for semtimedop() first appeared in version
2.3.3.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO SVr4, POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>NOTES The sem_undo structures of a process aren t
inherited by the child pro- duced by fork(2), but they are
inherited across an execve(2) system call.</p>

<p>semop() is never automatically restarted after being
interrupted by a signal handler, regardless of the setting
of the SA_RESTART flag when establishing a signal
handler.</p>

<p>semadj is a per-process integer which is simply the
(negative) count of all semaphore operations performed
specifying the SEM_UNDO flag. When a semaphores value is
directly set using the SETVAL or SETALL request to
semctl(2), the corresponding semadj values in all processes
are cleared.</p>

<p>The semval, sempid, semzcnt, and semnct values for a
semaphore can all be retrieved using appropriate semctl(2)
calls.</p>

<p>The following limits on semaphore set resources affect
the semop() call:</p>

<p>SEMOPM Maximum number of operations allowed for one
semop() call (32) (on Linux, this limit can be read and
modified via the third field of /proc/sys/kernel/sem).</p>

<p>SEMVMX Maximum allowable value for semval:
implementation dependent (32767).</p>

<p>The implementation has no intrinsic limits for the
adjust on exit maxi- mum value (SEMAEM), the system wide
maximum number of undo structures (SEMMNU) and the
per-process maximum number of undo entries system
parameters.</p>

<p>BUGS When a process terminates, its set of associated
semadj structures is used to undo the effect of all of the
semaphore operations it performed with the SEM_UNDO flag.
This raises a difficulty: if one (or more) of these
semaphore adjustments would result in an attempt to decrease
a semaphore s value below zero, what should an
implementation do? One possible approach would be to block
until all the semaphore adjustments could be performed. This
is however undesirable since it could force process
termination to block for arbitrarily long periods. Another
possibility is that such semaphore adjustments could be
ignored alto- gether (somewhat analogously to failing when
IPC_NOWAIT is specified for a semaphore operation). Linux
adopts a third approach: decreasing the semaphore value as
far as possible (i.e., to zero) and allowing process
termination to proceed immediately.</p>

<p>In kernels 2.6.x, x &lt;= 10, there is a bug that in
some circumstances prevents a process that is waiting for a
semaphore value to become zero from being woken up when the
value does actually become zero. This bug is fixed in kernel
2.6.11.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE The following code segment uses semop() to
atomically wait for the value of semaphore 0 to become zero,
and then increment the semaphore value by one.</p>

<p>struct sembuf sops[2]; int semid;</p>

<p>/* Code to set semid omitted */</p>

<p>sops[0].sem_num = 0; /* Operate on semaphore 0 */
sops[0].sem_op = 0; /* Wait for value to equal 0 */
sops[0].sem_flg = 0;</p>

<p>sops[1].sem_num = 0; /* Operate on semaphore 0 */
sops[1].sem_op = 1; /* Increment value by one */
sops[1].sem_flg = 0;</p>

<p>if (semop(semid, sops, 2) == -1) {
perror(&quot;semop&quot;); exit(EXIT_FAILURE); }</p>
