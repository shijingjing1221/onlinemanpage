<p>MODPROBE.CONF(5) MODPROBE.CONF(5)</p>

<p>NAME modprobe.d, modprobe.conf - Configuration
directory/file for modprobe</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Because the modprobe command can add or
remove more than one module, due to module dependencies, we
need a method of specifying what options are to be used with
those modules. All files underneath the /etc/mod- probe.d
directory which end with the .conf extension specify those
options as required. (the /etc/modprobe.conf file can also
be used if it exists, but that will be removed in a future
version). They can also be used to create convenient
aliases: alternate names for a module, or they can override
the normal modprobe behavior altogether for those with
special requirements (such as inserting more than one
module).</p>

<p>Note that module and alias names (like other module
names) can have - or _ in them: both are interchangable
throughout all the module com- mands.</p>

<p>The format of and files under modprobe.d and
/etc/modprobe.conf is sim- ple: one command per line, with
blank lines and lines starting with # ignored (useful for
adding comments). A at the end of a line causes it to
continue on the next line, which makes the file a bit
neater.</p>

<p>COMMANDS alias wildcard modulename This allows you to
give alternate names for a module. For exam- ple:
&quot;alias my-mod really_long_modulename&quot; means you
can use &quot;modprobe my-mod&quot; instead of
&quot;modprobe really_long_modulename&quot;. You can also
use shell-style wildcards, so &quot;alias my-mod*
really_long_modulename&quot; means that &quot;modprobe
my-mod-something&quot; has the same effect. You cant have
aliases to other aliases (that way lies madness), but
aliases can have options, which will be added to any other
options.</p>

<p>Note that modules can also contain their own aliases,
which you can see using modinfo. These aliases are used as a
last resort (ie. if there is no real module, install,
remove, or alias com- mand in the configuration).</p>

<p>options modulename option... This command allows you to
add options to the module modulename (which might be an
alias) every time it is inserted into the kernel: whether
directly (using modprobe modulename or because the module
being inserted depends on this module.</p>

<p>All options are added together: they can come from an
option for the module itself, for an alias, and on the
command line.</p>

<p>install modulename command... This is the most powerful
primitive: it tells modprobe to run your command instead of
inserting the module in the kernel as normal. The command
can be any shell command: this allows you to do any kind of
complex processing you might wish. For example, if the
module &quot;fred&quot; works better with the module
&quot;barney&quot; already installed (but it doesnt depend
on it, so modprobe won t automatically load it), you could
say &quot;install fred /sbin/modprobe barney; /sbin/modprobe
--ignore-install fred&quot;, which would do what you wanted.
Note the --ignore-install, which stops the second modprobe
from running the same install command again. See also remove
below.</p>

<p>You can also use install to make up modules which dont
otherwise exist. For example: &quot;install probe-ethernet
/sbin/mod- probe e100 || /sbin/modprobe eepro100&quot;,
which will first try to load the e100 driver, and if it
fails, then the eepro100 driver when you do &quot;modprobe
probe-ethernet&quot;.</p>

<p>If you use the string &quot;$CMDLINE_OPTS&quot; in the
command, it will be replaced by any options specified on the
modprobe command line. This can be useful because users
expect &quot;modprobe fred opt=1&quot; to pass the
&quot;opt=1&quot; arg to the module, even if there s an
install command in the configuration file. So our above
example becomes &quot;install fred /sbin/modprobe barney;
/sbin/modprobe --ignore- install fred
$CMDLINE_OPTS&quot;</p>

<p>remove modulename command... This is similar to the
install command above, except it is invoked when
&quot;modprobe -r&quot; is run. The removal counterparts to
the two examples above would be: &quot;remove fred
/sbin/modprobe -r --ignore-remove fred &amp;&amp;
/sbin/modprobe -r barney&quot;, and &quot;remove
probe-ethernet /sbin/modprobe -r eepro100 || /sbin/modprobe
-r e100&quot;.</p>

<p>blacklist modulename Modules can contain their own
aliases: usually these are aliases describing the devices
they support, such as &quot;pci:123...&quot;. These
&quot;internal&quot; aliases can be overridden by normal
&quot;alias&quot; keywords, but there are cases where two or
more modules both support the same devices, or a module
invalidly claims to support a device: the blacklist keyword
indicates that all of that particular mod- ules internal
aliases are to be ignored.</p>
