<p>PAPI_register_thread(3) PAPI PAPI_register_thread(3)</p>

<p>NAME PAPI_register_thread, PAPI_unregister_thread -
Inform PAPI of thread status</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;papi.h&gt; int
PAPI_register_thread (void); int PAPI_unregister_thread
(void); Fortran Interface #include fpapi.h
PAPIF_register_thread(C_INT check)
PAPIF_unregister_thread(C_INT check)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION PAPI_register_thread should be called when
the user wants to force PAPI to initialize a thread that
PAPI has not seen before. Usually this is not necessary as
PAPI implicitly detects the thread when an eventset is
created or other thread local PAPI functions are called.
However, it can be useful for debugging and performance
enhancements in the run- time systems of performance
tools.</p>

<p>PAPI_unregister_thread should be called when the user
wants to shutdown a particular thread and free the
associated thread ID. THIS IS IMPOR- TANT IF YOUR THREAD
LIBRARY REUSES THE SAME THREAD ID FOR A NEW KERNEL LWP.
OpenMP does this. OpenMP parallel regions, if separated by a
call to omp_set_num_threads() will often kill off the
underlying kernel LWPs and then start new ones for the next
region. However, omp_get_thread_id() does not reflect this,
as the thread IDs for the new LWPs will be the same as the
old LWPs. PAPI needs to know that the underlying LWP has
changed so it can set up the counters for that new thread.
This is accomplished by calling this function.</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS None.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUES On success, this function returns PAPI_OK.
On error, a non-zero error code is returned.</p>

<p>ERRORS PAPI_ENOMEM Space could not be allocated to store
the new thread informa- tion.</p>

<p>PAPI_ESYS A system or C library call failed inside PAPI,
see the errno variable.</p>

<p>PAPI_ESBSTR Hardware counters for this thread could not
be initialized.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>
