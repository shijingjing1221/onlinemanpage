<p>MEMCCPY(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual MEMCCPY(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME memccpy - copy bytes in memory</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;string.h&gt;</p>

<p>void *memccpy(void *restrict s1, const void *restrict
s2, int c, size_t n);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The memccpy() function shall copy bytes from
memory area s2 into s1, stopping after the first occurrence
of byte c (converted to an unsigned char) is copied, or
after n bytes are copied, whichever comes first. If copying
takes place between objects that overlap, the behavior is
unde- fined.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The memccpy() function shall return a
pointer to the byte after the copy of c in s1, or a null
pointer if c was not found in the first n bytes of s2.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The memccpy() function does not check
for the overflow of the receiving memory area.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>

1003.1-2001, &lt;string.h&gt;</p>
