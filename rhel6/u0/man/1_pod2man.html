<p>NAME pod2man - Convert POD data to formatted *roff
input</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pod2man [--center=string] [--date=string]
[--fixed=font] [--fixedbold=font] [--fixeditalic=font]
[--fixedbolditalic=font] [--name=name] [--official]
[--quotes=quotes] [--release[=version]] [--section=manext]
[--stderr] [--utf8] [--verbose] [input [output] ...]</p>

<p>pod2man --help</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pod2man is a front-end for Pod::Man, using
it to generate *roff input from POD source. The resulting
*roff code is suitable for display on a terminal using
nroff(1), normally via man(1), or printing using
troff(1).</p>

<p>input is the file to read for POD source (the POD can be
embedded in code). If input isn t given, it defaults to
&quot;STDIN&quot;. output, if given, is the file to which to
write the formatted output. If output isn t given, the
formatted output is written to &quot;STDOUT&quot;. Several
POD files can be processed in the same pod2man invocation
(saving module load and compile times) by providing multiple
pairs of input and output files on the command line.</p>

<p>--section, --release, --center, --date, and --official
can be used to set the headers and footers to use; if not
given, Pod::Man will assume various defaults. See below or
Pod::Man for details.</p>

<p>pod2man assumes that your *roff formatters have a
fixed-width font named &quot;CW&quot;. If yours is called
something else (like &quot;CR&quot;), use --fixed to specify
it. This generally only matters for troff output for
printing. Similarly, you can set the fonts used for bold,
italic, and bold italic fixed-width output.</p>

<p>Besides the obvious pod conversions, Pod::Man, and
therefore pod2man also takes care of formatting func(),
func(n), and simple variable references like $foo or @bar so
you dont have to use code escapes for them; complex
expressions like $fred{&rsquo;stuff&rsquo;} will still need
to be escaped, though. It also translates dashes that aren t
used as hyphens into en dashes, makes long dashes--like
this--into proper em dashes, fixes &quot;paired
quotes,&quot; and takes care of several other troff-specific
tweaks. See Pod::Man for complete information.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -c string, --center=string Sets the centered
page header to string. The default is &quot;User Contributed
Perl Documentation&quot;, but also see --official below.</p>

<p>-d string, --date=string Set the left-hand footer string
to this value. By default, the modification date of the
input file will be used, or the current date if input comes
from &quot;STDIN&quot;.</p>

<p>--fixed=font The fixed-width font to use for verbatim
text and code. Defaults to &quot;CW&quot;. Some systems may
want &quot;CR&quot; instead. Only matters for troff(1)
output.</p>

<p>--fixedbold=font Bold version of the fixed-width font.
Defaults to &quot;CB&quot;. Only matters for troff(1)
output.</p>

<p>--fixeditalic=font Italic version of the fixed-width
font (actually, something of a misnomer, since most
fixed-width fonts only have an oblique version, not an
italic version). Defaults to &quot;CI&quot;. Only matters
for troff(1) output.</p>

<p>--fixedbolditalic=font Bold italic (probably actually
oblique) version of the fixed-width font. Pod::Man doesn t
assume you have this, and defaults to &quot;CB&quot;. Some
systems (such as Solaris) have this font available as
&quot;CX&quot;. Only matters for troff(1) output.</p>

<p>-h, --help Print out usage information.</p>

<p>-l, --lax No longer used. pod2man used to check its
input for validity as a manual page, but this should now be
done by podchecker(1) instead. Accepted for backward
compatibility; this option no longer does anything.</p>

<p>-n name, --name=name Set the name of the manual page to
name. Without this option, the manual name is set to the
uppercased base name of the file being converted unless the
manual section is 3, in which case the path is parsed to see
if it is a Perl module path. If it is, a path like
&quot;.../lib/Pod/Man.pm&quot; is converted into a name like
&quot;Pod::Man&quot;. This option, if given, overrides any
automatic determination of the name.</p>

<p>Note that this option is probably not useful when
converting multiple POD files at once. The convention for
Unix man pages for commands is for the man page title to be
in all-uppercase even if the command isnt.</p>

<p>-o, --official Set the default header to indicate that
this page is part of the standard Perl release, if --center
is not also given.</p>

<p>-q quotes, --quotes=quotes Sets the quote marks used to
surround C&lt;&gt; text to quotes. If quotes is a single
character, it is used as both the left and right quote; if
quotes is two characters, the first character is used as the
left quote and the second as the right quoted; and if quotes
is four characters, the first two are used as the left quote
and the second two as the right quote.</p>

<p>quotes may also be set to the special value
&quot;none&quot;, in which case no quote marks are added
around C&lt;&gt; text (but the font is still changed for
troff output).</p>

<p>-r, --release Set the centered footer. By default, this
is the version of Perl you run pod2man under. Note that some
system an macro sets assume that the centered footer will be
a modification date and will prepend something like
&quot;Last modified: &quot;; if this is the case, you may
want to set --release to the last modified date and --date
to the version number.</p>

<p>-s, --section Set the section for the &quot;.TH&quot;
macro. The standard section numbering convention is to use 1
for user commands, 2 for system calls, 3 for functions, 4
for devices, 5 for file formats, 6 for games, 7 for
miscellaneous information, and 8 for administrator commands.
There is a lot of variation here, however; some systems
(like Solaris) use 4 for file formats, 5 for miscellaneous
information, and 7 for devices. Still others use 1m instead
of 8, or some mix of both. About the only section numbers
that are reliably consistent are 1, 2, and 3.</p>

<p>By default, section 1 will be used unless the file ends
in &quot;.pm&quot;, in which case section 3 will be
selected.</p>

<p>--stderr By default, pod2man puts any errors detected in
the POD input in a POD ERRORS section in the output manual
page. If --stderr is given, errors are sent to standard
error instead and the POD ERRORS section is suppressed.</p>

<p>-u, --utf8 By default, pod2man produces the most
conservative possible *roff output to try to ensure that it
will work with as many different *roff implementations as
possible. Many *roff implementations cannot handle non-ASCII
characters, so this means all non-ASCII characters are
converted either to a *roff escape sequence that tries to
create a properly accented character (at least for troff
output) or to &quot;X&quot;.</p>

<p>This option says to instead output literal UTF-8
characters. If your *roff implementation can handle it, this
is the best output format to use and avoids corruption of
documents containing non- ASCII characters. However, be
warned that *roff source with literal UTF-8 characters is
not supported by many implementations and may even result in
segfaults and other bad behavior.</p>

<p>Be aware that, when using this option, the input
encoding of your POD source must be properly declared unless
it is US-ASCII or Latin-1. POD input without an
&quot;=encoding&quot; command will be assumed to be in
Latin-1, and if its actually in UTF-8, the output will be
double-encoded. See perlpod(1) for more information on the
&quot;=encoding&quot; command.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose Print out the name of each output file as
it is being generated.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS If pod2man fails with errors, see Pod::Man
and Pod::Simple for information about what those errors
might mean.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES pod2man program &gt; program.1 pod2man
SomeModule.pm /usr/perl/man/man3/SomeModule.3 pod2man
--section=7 note.pod &gt; note.7</p>

<p>If you would like to print out a lot of man page
continuously, you probably want to set the C and D registers
to set contiguous page numbering and even/odd paging, at
least on some versions of man(7).</p>

<p>troff -man -rC1 -rD1 perl.1 perldata.1 perlsyn.1 ...</p>

<p>To get index entries on &quot;STDERR&quot;, turn on the
F register, as in:</p>

<p>troff -man -rF1 perl.1</p>

<p>The indexing merely outputs messages via &quot;.tm&quot;
for each major page, section, subsection, item, and any
&quot;X&lt;&gt;&quot; directives. See Pod::Man for more
details.</p>

<p>BUGS Lots of this documentation is duplicated from
Pod::Man.</p>

<p>NOTES For those not sure of the proper layout of a man
page, here are some notes on writing a proper man page.</p>

<p>The name of the program being documented is
conventionally written in bold (using B&lt;&gt;) wherever it
occurs, as are all program options. Arguments should be
written in italics (I&lt;&gt;). Functions are traditionally
written in italics; if you write a function as function(),
Pod::Man will take care of this for you. Literal code or
commands should be in C&lt;&gt;. References to other man
pages should be in the form &quot;manpage(section)&quot;,
and Pod::Man will automatically format those appropriately.
As an exception, its traditional not to use this form when
referring to module documentation; use
&quot;L&lt;Module::Name&gt;&quot; instead.</p>

<p>References to other programs or functions are normally
in the form of man page references so that cross-referencing
tools can provide the user with links and the like. Its
possible to overdo this, though, so be careful not to
clutter your documentation with too much markup.</p>

<p>The major headers should be set out using a
&quot;=head1&quot; directive, and are historically written
in the rather startling ALL UPPER CASE format, although this
is not mandatory. Minor headers may be included using
&quot;=head2&quot;, and are typically in mixed case.</p>

<p>The standard sections of a manual page are:</p>

<p>NAME Mandatory section; should be a comma-separated list
of programs or functions documented by this POD page, such
as:</p>

<p>foo, bar - programs to do something</p>

<p>Manual page indexers are often extremely picky about the
format of this section, so dont put anything in it except
this line. A single dash, and only a single dash, should
separate the list of programs or functions from the
description. Functions should not be qualified with
&quot;()&quot; or the like. The description should ideally
fit on a single line, even if a man program replaces the
dash with a few tabs.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS A short usage summary for programs and
functions. This section is mandatory for section 3
pages.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Extended description and discussion of the
program or functions, or the body of the documentation for
man pages that document something else. If particularly
long, its a good idea to break this up into subsections
&quot;=head2&quot; directives like:</p>

<p>=head2 Normal Usage</p>

<p>=head2 Advanced Features</p>

<p>=head2 Writing Configuration Files</p>

<p>or whatever is appropriate for your documentation.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Detailed description of each of the command-line
options taken by the program. This should be separate from
the description for the use of things like Pod::Usage. This
is normally presented as a list, with each option as a
separate &quot;=item&quot;. The specific option string
should be enclosed in B&lt;&gt;. Any values that the option
takes should be enclosed in I&lt;&gt;. For example, the
section for the option --section=manext would be introduced
with:</p>

<p>=item B&lt;--section&gt;=I&lt;manext&gt;</p>

<p>Synonymous options (like both the short and long forms)
are separated by a comma and a space on the same
&quot;=item&quot; line, or optionally listed as their own
item with a reference to the canonical name. For example,
since --section can also be written as -s, the above would
be:</p>

<p>=item B&lt;-s&gt; I&lt;manext&gt;,
B&lt;--section&gt;=I&lt;manext&gt;</p>

<p>(Writing the short option first is arguably easier to
read, since the long option is long enough to draw the eye
to it anyway and the short option can otherwise get lost in
visual noise.)</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE What the program or function returns, if
successful. This section can be omitted for programs whose
precise exit codes arent important, provided they return 0
on success as is standard. It should always be present for
functions.</p>

<p>ERRORS Exceptions, error return codes, exit statuses,
and errno settings. Typically used for function
documentation; program documentation uses DIAGNOSTICS
instead. The general rule of thumb is that errors printed to
&quot;STDOUT&quot; or &quot;STDERR&quot; and intended for
the end user are documented in DIAGNOSTICS while errors
passed internal to the calling program and intended for
other programmers are documented in ERRORS. When documenting
a function that sets errno, a full list of the possible
errno values should be given here.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS All possible messages the program can print
out--and what they mean. You may wish to follow the same
documentation style as the Perl documentation; see
perldiag(1) for more details (and look at the POD source as
well).</p>

<p>If applicable, please include details on what the user
should do to correct the error; documenting an error as
indicating &quot;the input buffer is too small&quot; without
telling the user how to increase the size of the input
buffer (or at least telling them that it isnt possible)
arent very useful.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Give some example uses of the program or
function. Dont skimp; users often find this the most useful
part of the documentation. The examples are generally given
as verbatim paragraphs.</p>

<p>Don t just present an example without explaining what it
does. Adding a short paragraph saying what the example will
do can increase the value of the example immensely.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT Environment variables that the program cares
about, normally presented as a list using &quot;=over&quot;,
&quot;=item&quot;, and &quot;=back&quot;. For example:</p>

<p>=over 6</p>

<p>=item HOME</p>

<p>Used to determine the user&rsquo;s home directory.
F&lt;.foorc&gt; in this directory is read for configuration
details, if it exists.</p>

<p>=back</p>

<p>Since environment variables are normally in all
uppercase, no additional special formatting is generally
needed; theyre glaring enough as it is.</p>

<p>FILES All files used by the program or function,
normally presented as a list, and what it uses them for.
File names should be enclosed in F&lt;&gt;. It s
particularly important to document files that will be
potentially modified.</p>

<p>CAVEATS Things to take special care with, sometimes
called WARNINGS.</p>

<p>BUGS Things that are broken or just dont work quite
right.</p>

<p>RESTRICTIONS Bugs you dont plan to fix. :-)</p>

<p>NOTES Miscellaneous commentary.</p>

<p>AUTHOR Who wrote it (use AUTHORS for multiple people).
Including your current e-mail address (or some e-mail
address to which bug reports should be sent) so that users
have a way of contacting you is a good idea. Remember that
program documentation tends to roam the wild for far longer
than you expect and pick an e-mail address thats likely to
last if possible.</p>

<p>HISTORY Programs derived from other sources sometimes
have this, or you might keep a modification log here. If the
log gets overly long or detailed, consider maintaining it in
a separate file, though.</p>

<p>COPYRIGHT AND LICENSE For copyright</p>

<p>Copyright YEAR(s) by YOUR NAME(s)</p>

<p>(No, (C) is not needed. No, &quot;all rights
reserved&quot; is not needed.)</p>

<p>For licensing the easiest way is to use the same
licensing as Perl itself:</p>

<p>This library is free software; you may redistribute it
and/or modify it under the same terms as Perl itself.</p>

<p>This makes it easy for people to use your module with
Perl. Note that this licensing is neither an endorsement or
a requirement, you are of course free to choose any
licensing.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO Other man pages to check out, like man(1),
man(7), makewhatis(8), or catman(8). Normally a simple list
of man pages separated by commas, or a paragraph giving the
name of a reference work. Man page references, if they use
the standard &quot;name(section)&quot; form, don t have to
be enclosed in L&lt;&gt; (although its recommended), but
other things in this section probably should be when
appropriate.</p>

<p>If the package has a mailing list, include a URL or
subscription instructions here.</p>

<p>If the package has a web site, include a URL here.</p>

<p>In addition, some systems use CONFORMING TO to note
conformance to relevant standards and MT-LEVEL to note
safeness for use in threaded programs or signal handlers.
These headings are primarily useful when documenting parts
of a C library. Documentation of object-oriented libraries
or modules may use CONSTRUCTORS and METHODS sections for
detailed documentation of the parts of the library and save
the DESCRIPTION section for an overview; other large modules
may use FUNCTIONS for similar reasons. Some people use
OVERVIEW to summarize the description if its quite long.</p>

<p>Section ordering varies, although NAME should always be
the first section (youll break some man page systems
otherwise), and NAME, SYNOPSIS, DESCRIPTION, and OPTIONS
generally always occur first and in that order if present.
In general, SEE ALSO, AUTHOR, and similar material should be
left for last. Some systems also move WARNINGS and NOTES to
last. The order given above should be reasonable for most
purposes.</p>

<p>Finally, as a general note, try not to use an excessive
amount of markup. As documented here and in Pod::Man, you
can safely leave Perl variables, function names, man page
references, and the like unadorned by markup and the POD
translators will figure it out for you. This makes it much
easier to later edit the documentation. Note that many
existing translators (including this one currently) will do
the wrong thing with e-mail addresses when wrapped in
L&lt;&gt;, so don t do that.</p>

<p>For additional information that may be more accurate for
your specific system, see either man(5) or man(7) depending
on your system manual section numbering conventions.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO Pod::Man, Pod::Simple, man(1), nroff(1),
perlpod(1), podchecker(1), troff(1), man(7)</p>

<p>The man page documenting the an macro set may be man(5)
instead of man(7) on your system.</p>
