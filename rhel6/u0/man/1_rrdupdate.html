<p>RRDUPDATE(1) rrdtool RRDUPDATE(1)</p>

<p>NAME rrdupdate - Store a new set of values into the
RRD</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rrdtool {update | updatev} filename
[--template|-t ds-name[:ds- name]...]
N|timestamp:value[:value...] at-timestamp@value[:value...]
[timestamp:value[:value...] ...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The update function feeds new data values
into an RRD. The data is time aligned (interpolated)
according to the properties of the RRD to which the data is
written.</p>

<p>updatev This alternate version of update takes the same
arguments and performs the same function. The v stands for
verbose, which describes the output returned. updatev
returns a list of any and all consolidated data points
(CDPs) written to disk as a result of the invocation of
update. The values are indexed by timestamp (time_t), RRA
(consolidation function and PDPs per CDP), and data source
(name). Note that depending on the arguments of the current
and previous call to update, the list may have no entries or
a large number of entries.</p>

<p>filename The name of the RRD you want to update.</p>

<p>--template|-t ds-name[:ds-name]... By default, the
update function expects its data input in the order the data
sources are defined in the RRD, excluding any COMPUTE data
sources (i.e. if the third data source DST is COMPUTE, the
third input value will be mapped to the fourth data source
in the RRD and so on). This is not very error resistant, as
you might be sending the wrong data into an RRD.</p>

<p>The template switch allows you to specify which data
sources you are going to update and in which order. If the
data sources specified in the template are not available in
the RRD file, the update process will abort with an error
message.</p>

<p>While it appears possible with the template switch to
update data sources asynchronously, RRDtool implicitly
assigns non- COMPUTE data sources missing from the template
the *UNKNOWN* value.</p>

<p>Do not specify a value for a COMPUTE DST in the update
function. If this is done accidentally (and this can only be
done using the template switch), RRDtool will ignore the
value specified for the COMPUTE DST.</p>

<p>N|timestamp:value[:value...] The data used for updating
the RRD was acquired at a certain time. This time can either
be defined in seconds since 1970-01-01 or by using the
letter N, in which case the update time is set to be the
current time. Negative time values are subtracted from the
current time. An AT_STYLE TIME SPECIFICATION (see the
rrdfetch documentation) may also be used by delimiting the
end of the time specification with the @ character instead
of a :. Getting the timing right to the second is especially
important when you are working with data- sources of type
COUNTER, DERIVE or ABSOLUTE.</p>

<p>The remaining elements of the argument are DS updates.
The order of this list is the same as the order the data
sources were defined in the RRA. If there is no data for a
certain data-source, the letter U (e.g., N:0.1:U:1) can be
specified.</p>

<p>The format of the value acquired from the data source is
dependent on the data source type chosen. Normally it will
be numeric, but the data acquisition modules may impose
their very own parsing of this parameter as long as the
colon (:) remains the data source value separator.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE &quot;rrdtool update demo1.rrd
N:3.44:3.15:U:23&quot;</p>

<p>Update the database file demo1.rrd with 3 known and one
*UNKNOWN* value. Use the current time as the update
time.</p>

<p>&quot;rrdtool update demo2.rrd 887457267:U 887457521:22
887457903:2.7&quot;</p>

<p>Update the database file demo2.rrd which expects data
from a single data-source, three times. First with an
*UNKNOWN* value then with two regular readings. The update
interval seems to be around 300 seconds.</p>
