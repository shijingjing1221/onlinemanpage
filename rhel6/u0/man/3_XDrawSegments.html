<p>XDrawLine(3) XLIB FUNCTIONS XDrawLine(3)</p>

<p>NAME XDrawLine, XDrawLines, XDrawSegments, XSegment -
draw lines, polygons, and line structure</p>

<p>SYNTAX int XDrawLine(Display *display, Drawable d, GC
gc, int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2);</p>

<p>int XDrawLines(Display *display, Drawable d, GC gc,
XPoint *points, int npoints, int mode);</p>

<p>int XDrawSegments(Display *display, Drawable d, GC gc,
XSegment *seg- ments, int nsegments);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS d Specifies the drawable.</p>

<p>display Specifies the connection to the X server.</p>

<p>gc Specifies the GC.</p>

<p>mode Specifies the coordinate mode. You can pass
CoordModeOrigin or CoordModePrevious.</p>

<p>npoints Specifies the number of points in the array.</p>

<p>nsegments Specifies the number of segments in the
array.</p>

<p>points Specifies an array of points.</p>

<p>segments Specifies an array of segments.</p>

<p>x1 y1 x2 y2 Specify the points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) to
be connected.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The XDrawLine function uses the components
of the specified GC to draw a line between the specified set
of points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). It does not perform joining
at coincident endpoints. For any given line, XDrawLine does
not draw a pixel more than once. If lines intersect, the
intersecting pixels are drawn multiple times.</p>

<p>The XDrawLines function uses the components of the
specified GC to draw npoints-1 lines between each pair of
points (point[i], point[i+1]) in the array of XPoint
structures. It draws the lines in the order listed in the
array. The lines join correctly at all intermediate points,
and if the first and last points coincide, the first and
last lines also join correctly. For any given line,
XDrawLines does not draw a pixel more than once. If thin
(zero line-width) lines intersect, the inter- secting pixels
are drawn multiple times. If wide lines intersect, the
intersecting pixels are drawn only once, as though the
entire PolyLine protocol request were a single, filled
shape. CoordModeOrigin treats all coordinates as relative to
the origin, and CoordModePrevious treats all coordinates
after the first as relative to the previous point.</p>

<p>The XDrawSegments function draws multiple, unconnected
lines. For each segment, XDrawSegments draws a line between
(x1, y1) and (x2, y2). It draws the lines in the order
listed in the array of XSegment structures and does not
perform joining at coincident endpoints. For any given line,
XDrawSegments does not draw a pixel more than once. If lines
intersect, the intersecting pixels are drawn multiple
times.</p>

<p>All three functions use these GC components: function,
plane-mask, line-width, line-style, cap-style, fill-style,
subwindow-mode, clip-x- origin, clip-y-origin, and
clip-mask. The XDrawLines function also uses the join-style
GC component. All three functions also use these GC
mode-dependent components: foreground, background, tile,
stipple, tile-stipple-x-origin, tile-stipple-y-origin,
dash-offset, and dash- list.</p>

<p>XDrawLine, XDrawLines, and XDrawSegments can generate
BadDrawable, BadGC, and BadMatch errors. XDrawLines can also
generate a BadValue error.</p>

<p>STRUCTURES The XSegment structure contains:</p>

<p>typedef struct { short x1, y1, x2, y2; } XSegment;</p>

<p>All x and y members are signed integers. The width and
height members are 16-bit unsigned integers. You should be
careful not to generate coordinates and sizes out of the
16-bit ranges, because the protocol only has 16-bit fields
for these values.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS BadDrawable A value for a Drawable argument
does not name a defined Win- dow or Pixmap.</p>

<p>BadGC A value for a GContext argument does not name a
defined GCon- text.</p>

<p>BadMatch An InputOnly window is used as a Drawable.</p>

<p>BadMatch Some argument or pair of arguments has the
correct type and range but fails to match in some other way
required by the request.</p>

<p>BadValue Some numeric value falls outside the range of
values accepted by the request. Unless a specific range is
specified for an argument, the full range defined by the
argument s type is accepted. Any argument defined as a set
of alternatives can generate this error.</p>
