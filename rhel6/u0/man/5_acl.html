<p>NAME acl - Access Control Lists</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page describes POSIX Access
Control Lists, which are used to define more fine-grained
discretionary access rights for files and direc- tories.</p>

<p>ACL TYPES Every object can be thought of as having
associated with it an ACL that governs the discretionary
access to that object; this ACL is referred to as an access
ACL. In addition, a directory may have an associated ACL
that governs the initial access ACL for objects created
within that directory; this ACL is referred to as a default
ACL.</p>

<p>ACL ENTRIES An ACL consists of a set of ACL entries. An
ACL entry specifies the access permissions on the associated
object for an individual user or a group of users as a
combination of read, write and search/execute permis-
sions.</p>

<p>An ACL entry contains an entry tag type, an optional
entry tag qualifier, and a set of permissions. We use the
term qualifier to denote the entry tag qualifier of an ACL
entry.</p>

<p>The qualifier denotes the identifier of a user or a
group, for entries with tag types of ACL_USER or ACL_GROUP,
respectively. Entries with tag types other than ACL_USER or
ACL_GROUP have no defined qualifiers.</p>

<p>The following entry tag types are defined:</p>

<p>ACL_USER_OBJ The ACL_USER_OBJ entry denotes access
rights for the file owner.</p>

<p>ACL_USER ACL_USER entries denote access rights for users
identified by the entrys qualifier.</p>

<p>ACL_GROUP_OBJ The ACL_GROUP_OBJ entry denotes access
rights for the file group.</p>

<p>ACL_GROUP ACL_GROUP entries denote access rights for
groups identified by the entrys qualifier.</p>

<p>ACL_MASK The ACL_MASK entry denotes the maximum access
rights that can be granted by entries of type ACL_USER,
ACL_GROUP_OBJ, or ACL_GROUP.</p>

<p>ACL_OTHER The ACL_OTHER entry denotes access rights for
pro- cesses that do not match any other entry in the
ACL.</p>

<p>When an access check is performed, the ACL_USER_OBJ and
ACL_USER entries are tested against the effective user ID.
The effective group ID, as well as all supplementary group
IDs are tested against the ACL_GROUP_OBJ and ACL_GROUP
entries.</p>

<p>VALID ACLs A valid ACL contains exactly one entry with
each of the ACL_USER_OBJ, ACL_GROUP_OBJ, and ACL_OTHER tag
types. Entries with ACL_USER and ACL_GROUP tag types may
appear zero or more times in an ACL. An ACL that contains
entries of ACL_USER or ACL_GROUP tag types must contain
exactly one entry of the ACL_MASK tag type. If an ACL
contains no entries of ACL_USER or ACL_GROUP tag types, the
ACL_MASK entry is optional.</p>

<p>All user ID qualifiers must be unique among all entries
of ACL_USER tag type, and all group IDs must be unique among
all entries of ACL_GROUP tag type.</p>

<p>The acl_get_file() function returns an ACL with zero ACL
entries as the default ACL of a directory, if the directory
is not associated with a default ACL. The acl_set_file()
function also accepts an ACL with zero ACL entries as a
valid default ACL for directories, denoting that the
directory shall not be associated with a default ACL. This
is equivalent to using the acl_delete_def_file()
function.</p>

<p>CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN ACL ENTRIES AND FILE PERMISSION
BITS The permissions defined by ACLs are a superset of the
permissions speci- fied by the file permission bits.</p>

<p>There is a correspondence between the file owner, group,
and other per- missions and specific ACL entries: the owner
permissions correspond to the permissions of the
ACL_USER_OBJ entry. If the ACL has an ACL_MASK entry, the
group permissions correspond to the permissions of the
ACL_MASK entry. Otherwise, if the ACL has no ACL_MASK entry,
the group permissions correspond to the permissions of the
ACL_GROUP_OBJ entry. The other permissions correspond to the
permissions of the ACL_OTHER_OBJ entry.</p>

<p>The file owner, group, and other permissions always
match the permissions of the corresponding ACL entry.
Modification of the file permission bits results in the
modification of the associated ACL entries, and modifica-
tion of these ACL entries results in the modification of the
file permis- sion bits.</p>

<p>OBJECT CREATION AND DEFAULT ACLs The access ACL of a
file object is initialized when the object is created with
any of the creat(), mkdir(), mknod(), mkfifo(), or open()
functions. If a default ACL is associated with a directory,
the mode parameter to the functions creating file objects
and the default ACL of the directory are used to determine
the ACL of the new object:</p>

<p>1. The new object inherits the default ACL of the
containing directory as its access ACL.</p>

<p>2. The access ACL entries corresponding to the file
permission bits are modified so that they contain no
permissions that are not contained in the permissions
specified by the mode parameter.</p>

<p>If no default ACL is associated with a directory, the
mode parameter to the functions creating file objects and
the file creation mask (see umask(2)) are used to determine
the ACL of the new object:</p>

<p>1. The new object is assigned an access ACL containing
entries of tag types ACL_USER_OBJ, ACL_GROUP_OBJ, and
ACL_OTHER. The permissions of these entries are set to the
permissions specified by the file cre- ation mask.</p>

<p>2. The access ACL entries corresponding to the file
permission bits are modified so that they contain no
permissions that are not contained in the permissions
specified by the mode parameter.</p>

<p>ACCESS CHECK ALGORITHM A process may request read,
write, or execute/search access to a file object protected
by an ACL. The access check algorithm determines whether
access to the object will be granted.</p>

<p>1. If the effective user ID of the process matches the
user ID of the file object owner, then</p>

<p>if the ACL_USER_OBJ entry contains the requested
permissions, access is granted,</p>

<p>else access is denied.</p>

<p>2. else if the effective user ID of the process matches
the qualifier of any entry of type ACL_USER, then</p>

<p>if the matching ACL_USER entry and the ACL_MASK entry
contain the requested permissions, access is granted,</p>

<p>else access is denied.</p>

<p>3. else if the effective group ID or any of the
supplementary group IDs of the process match the file group
or the qualifier of any entry of type ACL_GROUP, then</p>

<p>if the ACL contains an ACL_MASK entry, then</p>

<p>if the ACL_MASK entry and any of the matching
ACL_GROUP_OBJ or ACL_GROUP entries contain the requested
permissions, access is granted,</p>

<p>else access is denied.</p>

<p>else (note that there can be no ACL_GROUP entries
without an ACL_MASK entry)</p>

<p>if the ACL_GROUP_OBJ entry contains the requested
permis- sions, access is granted,</p>

<p>else access is denied.</p>

<p>4. else if the ACL_OTHER entry contains the requested
permissions, access is granted.</p>

<p>5. else access is denied.</p>

<p>ACL TEXT FORMS A long and a short text form for
representing ACLs is defined. In both forms, ACL entries are
represented as three colon separated fields: an ACL entry
tag type, an ACL entry qualifier, and the discretionary
access permissions. The first field contains one of the
following entry tag type keywords:</p>

<p>user A user ACL entry specifies the access granted to
either the file owner (entry tag type ACL_USER_OBJ) or a
specified user (entry tag type ACL_USER).</p>

<p>group A group ACL entry specifies the access granted to
either the file group (entry tag type ACL_GROUP_OBJ) or a
speci- fied group (entry tag type ACL_GROUP).</p>

<p>mask A mask ACL entry specifies the maximum access which
can be granted by any ACL entry except the user entry for
the file owner and the other entry (entry tag type
ACL_MASK).</p>

<p>other An other ACL entry specifies the access granted to
any pro- cess that does not match any user or group ACL
entries (entry tag type ACL_OTHER).</p>

<p>The second field contains the user or group identifier
of the user or group associated with the ACL entry for
entries of entry tag type ACL_USER or ACL_GROUP, and is
empty for all other entries. A user identi- fier can be a
user name or a user ID number in decimal form. A group
identifier can be a group name or a group ID number in
decimal form.</p>

<p>The third field contains the discretionary access
permissions. The read, write and search/execute permissions
are represented by the r, w, and x characters, in this
order. Each of these characters is replaced by the -
character to denote that a permission is absent in the ACL
entry. When converting from the text form to the internal
representation, permissions that are absent need not be
specified.</p>

<p>White space is permitted at the beginning and end of
each ACL entry, and immediately before and after a field
separator (the colon character).</p>

<p>LONG TEXT FORM The long text form contains one ACL entry
per line. In addition, a number sign (#) may start a comment
that extends until the end of the line. If an ACL_USER,
ACL_GROUP_OBJ or ACL_GROUP ACL entry contains permissions
that are not also contained in the ACL_MASK entry, the entry
is followed by a number sign, the string effective:, and the
effective access per- missions defined by that entry. This
is an example of the long text form:</p>

<p>user::rw- user:lisa:rw- #effective:r-- group::r--
group:toolies:rw- #effective:r-- mask::r-- other::r--</p>

<p>SHORT TEXT FORM The short text form is a sequence of ACL
entries separated by commas, and is used for input. Comments
are not supported. Entry tag type keywords may either appear
in their full unabbreviated form, or in their single letter
abbreviated form. The abbreviation for user is u, the
abbreviation for group is g, the abbreviation for mask is m,
and the abbreviation for other is o. The permissions may
contain at most one each of the follow- ing characters in
any order: r, w, x. These are examples of the short text
form:</p>

<p>u::rw-,u:lisa:rw-,g::r--,g:toolies:rw-,m::r--,o::r--
g:toolies:rw,u:lisa:rw,u::wr,g::r,o::r,m::r</p>

<p>RATIONALE IEEE 1003.1e draft 17 defines Access Control
Lists that include entries of tag type ACL_MASK, and defines
a mapping between file permission bits that is not constant.
The standard working group defined this relatively complex
interface in order to ensure that applications that are
compliant with IEEE 1003.1 (POSIX.1) will still function as
expected on systems with ACLs. The IEEE 1003.1e draft 17
contains the rationale for choosing this interface in
section B.23.</p>

<p>CHANGES TO THE FILE UTILITIES On a system that supports
ACLs, the file utilities ls(1), cp(1), and mv(1) change
their behavior in the following way:</p>

<p>&middot; For files that have a default ACL or an access
ACL that contains more than the three required ACL entries,
the ls(1) utility in the long form produced by ls -l
displays a plus sign (+) after the permission string.</p>

<p>&middot; If the -p flag is specified, the cp(1) utility
also preserves ACLs. If this is not possible, a warning is
produced.</p>

<p>&middot; The mv(1) utility always preserves ACLs. If
this is not possible, a warning is produced.</p>

<p>The effect of the chmod(1) utility, and of the chmod(2)
system call, on the access ACL is described in
CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN ACL ENTRIES AND FILE PERMISSION
BITS.</p>

<p>STANDARDS The IEEE 1003.1e draft 17 ( POSIX.1e )
document describes several secu- rity extensions to the IEEE
1003.1 standard. While the work on 1003.1e has been
abandoned, many UNIX style systems implement parts of
POSIX.1e draft 17, or of earlier drafts.</p>

<p>Linux Access Control Lists implement the full set of
functions and utili- ties defined for Access Control Lists
in POSIX.1e, and several exten- sions. The implementation is
fully compliant with POSIX.1e draft 17; extensions are
marked as such. The Access Control List manipulation
functions are defined in the ACL library (libacl, -lacl).
The POSIX com- pliant interfaces are declared in the
&lt;sys/acl.h&gt; header. Linux-specific extensions to these
functions are declared in the &lt;acl/libacl.h&gt;
header.</p>
