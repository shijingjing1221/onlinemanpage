<p>NAME XmTextCut A Text function that copies the primary
selection to the clipboard and deletes the selected text</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;Xm/Text.h&gt; Boolean XmTextCut(
Widget widget, Time time);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION XmTextCut copies the primary selected text
to the clipboard and then deletes the primary selected text.
This routine calls the widgets XmNvalueChangedCallback and
verification callbacks, either XmNmodi- fyVerifyCallback or
XmNmodifyVerifyCallbackWcs, or both. If both veri- fication
callback lists are registered, the procedures of the
XmNmodi- fyVerifyCallback list are executed first and the
resulting data is passed to the XmNmodifyVerifyCallbackWcs
callbacks.</p>

<p>This routine calls the XmNconvertCallback procedures,
possibly multiple times, with the selection member of the
XmConvertCallbackStruct set to CLIPBOARD and with the parm
member set to XmMOVE. If the transfer is successful, this
routine then calls the XmNconvertCallback procedures for the
CLIPBOARD selection and the DELETE target.</p>

<p>widget Specifies the Text widget ID.</p>

<p>time Specifies the server time at which the selection
value is to be modified. This should be the time of the
event that trig- gered this request. One source of a valid
time stamp is the function XtLastTimestampProcessed().</p>

<p>For a complete definition of Text and its associated
resources, see XmText(3).</p>

<p>RETURN This function returns False if the primary
selection is NULL, if the widget does not own the primary
selection, if the function is unable to gain ownership of
the clipboard selection, or if no data is placed on the
clipboard. Otherwise, it returns True.</p>
