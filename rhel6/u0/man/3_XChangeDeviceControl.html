<p>XGETDEVICECONTROL(3) [FIXME: manual]
XGETDEVICECONTROL(3)</p>

<p>NAME XGetDeviceControl, XChangeDeviceControl - query and
change input device controls</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;X11/extensions/XInput.h&gt;</p>

<p>XDeviceControl *XGetDeviceControl( Display *display,
XDevice *device, int *controlType);</p>

<p>int XChangeDeviceControl( Display *display, XDevice
*device, int controlType, XDeviceControl *control);</p>

<p>display Specifies the connection to the X server.</p>

<p>device Specifies the device whose control is to be
interrogated or modified.</p>

<p>controlType Specifies the type of control to be
interrogated or changed.</p>

<p>control Specifies the address of an XDeviceControl
structure that contains the new values for the Device.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION These requests are provided to manipulate
those input devices that support device control. A BadMatch
error will be generated if the requested device does not
support any device controls.</p>

<p>Valid device control types that can be used with these
requests include the following:</p>

<p>DEVICE_RESOLUTION Queries or changes the resolution of
valuators on input devices.</p>

<p>The XGetDeviceControl request returns a pointer to an
XDeviceControl structure.</p>

<p>XGetDeviceControl can generate a BadDevice or BadMatch
error.</p>

<p>The XChangeDeviceControl request modifies the values of
one control on the specified device. The control is
identified by the id field of the XDeviceControl structure
that is passed with the request.</p>

<p>XChangeDeviceControl can generate a BadDevice, BadMatch,
or BadValue error..SH STRUCTURES Each control is described
by a structure specific to that control. These structures
are defined in the file XInput.h.</p>

<p>XDeviceControl is a generic structure that contains two
fields that are at the beginning of each class of
control:</p>

<p>typedef struct { XID class; int length; }
XDeviceControl;</p>

<p>The XDeviceResolutionState structure defines the
information that is returned for device resolution for
devices with valuators.</p>

<p>typedef struct { XID control; int length; int
num_valuators; int* resolutions; int* min_resolutions; int*
max_resolutions; } XDeviceResolutionState;</p>

<p>The XDeviceResolutionControl structure defines the
attributes that can be controlled for keyboard Devices.</p>

<p>typedef struct { XID control; int length; int
first_valuator; int num_valuators; int* resolutions; }
XDeviceResolutionControl;</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS BadDevice An invalid device was specified.
The specified device does not exist or has not been opened
by this client via XOpenInputDevice. This error may also
occur if some other client has caused the specified device
to become the X keyboard or X pointer device via the
XChangeKeyboardDevice or XChangePointerDevice requests.</p>

<p>BadMatch This error may occur if an XGetDeviceControl
request was made specifying a device that has no controls or
an XChangeDeviceControl request was made with an
XDeviceControl structure that contains an invalid Device
type. It may also occur if an invalid combination of mask
bits is specified ( DvKey but no DvAutoRepeatMode for
keyboard Devices), or if an invalid KeySym is specified for
a string Device.</p>

<p>BadValue Some numeric value falls outside the range of
values accepted by the XChangeDeviceControl request. Unless
a specific range is specified for an argument, the full
range defined by the argument&acute;s type is accepted. Any
argument defined as a set of alternatives can generate this
error.</p>
