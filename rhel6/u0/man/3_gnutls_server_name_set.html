<p>NAME gnutls_server_name_set - set a name indicator to be
sent as an exten- sion</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;gnutls/gnutls.h&gt;</p>

<p>int gnutls_server_name_set(gnutls_session_t session,
gnutls_server_name_type_t type, const void * name, size_t
name_length);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS gnutls_session_t session is a gnutls_session_t
structure.</p>

<p>gnutls_server_name_type_t type specifies the indicator
type</p>

<p>const void * name is a string that contains the server
name.</p>

<p>size_t name_length holds the length of name</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This function is to be used by clients that
want to inform (via a TLS extension mechanism) the server of
the name they connected to. This should be used by clients
that connect to servers that do virtual host- ing.</p>

<p>The value of name depends on the ind type. In case of
GNUTLS_NAME_DNS, an ASCII or UTF-8 null terminated string,
without the trailing dot, is expected. IPv4 or IPv6
addresses are not permitted.</p>

<p>RETURNS On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (zero) is returned,
otherwise an error code is returned.</p>
