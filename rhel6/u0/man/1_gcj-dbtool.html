<p>NAME gcj-dbtool - Manipulate class file mapping
databases for libgcj</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS gcj-dbtool OPTION DBFILE [MORE] ...</p>

<p>gcj-dbtool [-0] [-] [-n] [-a] [-f] [-t] [-l] [-p
[LIBDIR]] [-v] [-m] [--version] [--help]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION &quot;gcj-dbtool&quot; is a tool for
creating and manipulating class file mapping databases.
&quot;libgcj&quot; can use these databases to find a shared
library corresponding to the bytecode representation of a
class. This functionality is useful for ahead-of-time
compilation of a program that has no knowledge of
&quot;gcj&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;gcj-dbtool&quot; works best if all the jar files
added to it are compiled using
&quot;-findirect-dispatch&quot;.</p>

<p>Note that &quot;gcj-dbtool&quot; is currently available
as &quot;preview technology&quot;. We believe it is a
reasonable way to allow application-transparent
ahead-of-time compilation, but this is an unexplored area.
We welcome your comments.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -n DBFILE [SIZE] This creates a new database.
Currently, databases cannot be resized; you can choose a
larger initial size if desired. The default size is
32,749.</p>

<p>-a DBFILE JARFILE LIB -f DBFILE JARFILE LIB This adds a
jar file to the database. For each class file in the jar, a
cryptographic signature of the bytecode representation of
the class is recorded in the database. At runtime, a class
is looked up by its signature and the compiled form of the
class is looked for in the corresponding shared library. The
-a option will verify that LIB exists before adding it to
the database; -f skips this check.</p>

<p>[-][-0] -m DBFILE DBFILE,[DBFILE] Merge a number of
databases. The output database overwrites any existing
database. To add databases into an existing database,
include the destination in the list of sources.</p>

<p>If - or -0 are used, the list of files to read is taken
from standard input instead of the command line. For -0,
Input filenames are terminated by a null character instead
of by whitespace. Useful when arguments might contain white
space. The GNU find -print0 option produces input suitable
for this mode.</p>

<p>-t DBFILE Test a database.</p>

<p>-l DBFILE List the contents of a database.</p>

<p>-p Print the name of the default database. If there is
no default database, this prints a blank line. If LIBDIR is
specified, use it instead of the default library directory
component of the database name.</p>

<p>--help Print a help message, then exit.</p>

<p>--version -v Print version information, then exit.</p>
