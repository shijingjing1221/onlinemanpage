<p>NAME usernetctl - allow a user to manipulate a network
interface if permit- ted</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS usernetctl interface-name up|down|report</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION usernetctl checks to see if users are
allowed to manipulate the network interface specified by
interface-name, and then tries to bring the net- work
interface up or down, if up or down was specified on the
command line, or returns true or false status (respectively)
if the report option was specified.</p>

<p>usernetctl is not really meant to be called directly by
users, though it currently works fine that way. It is used
as a wrapper by the ifup and ifdown scripts, so that users
can do exactly the same thing as root: ifup interface-name
ifdown interface-name and ifup and ifdown will call
usernetctl automatically to allow the interface status
change.</p>

<p>OPTIONS interface-name The name of the network interface
to check; for example, &quot;ppp0&quot;. For backwards
compatibility, &quot;ifcfg-ppp0&quot; and &quot;/etc/syscon-
fig/network-scripts/ifcfg-ppp0&quot; are also supported.</p>

<p>up|down Attempt to bring the interface up or down.</p>

<p>report Report on whether users can bring the interface
up or down.</p>

<p>NOTES Alternate device configurations may inherit the
default configurations permissions.</p>
