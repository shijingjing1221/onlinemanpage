<p>NAME rx, rb, rz - XMODEM, YMODEM, ZMODEM (Batch) file
receive</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rz [- +8abeOpqRtTuUvy] rb [- +abqRtuUvy] rx [-
abceqRtuUv] file [-][v]rzCOMMAND</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program uses error correcting protocols
to receive files over a dial-in serial port from a variety
of programs running under PC-DOS, CP/M, Unix, and other
operating systems. It is invoked from a shell prompt
manually, or automatically as a result of an &quot;sz file
...&quot; com- mand given to the calling program.</p>

<p>While rz is smart enough to be called from cu(1), very
few versions of cu(1) are smart enough to allow rz to work
properly. Unix flavors of Professional-YAM are available for
such dial-out application.</p>

<p>Rz (Receive ZMODEM) receives files with the ZMODEM batch
protocol. Pathnames are supplied by the sending program, and
directories are made if necessary (and possible). Normally,
the &quot;rz&quot; command is automati- cally issued by the
calling ZMODEM program, but some defective ZMODEM
implementations may require starting rz the old fashioned
way.</p>

<p>Rb receives file(s) with YMODEM, accepting either
standard 128 byte sectors or 1024 byte sectors (YAM sb -k
option). The user should determine when the 1024 byte block
length actually improves throughput without causing lost
data or even system crashes.</p>

<p>If True YMODEM (Omen Technology trademark) file
information (file length, etc.) is received, the file length
controls the number of bytes written to the output dataset,
and the modify time and file mode (iff non zero) are set
accordingly.</p>

<p>If no True YMODEM file information is received, slashes
in the pathname are changed to underscore, and any trailing
period in the pathname is eliminated. This conversion is
useful for files received from CP/M systems. With YMODEM,
each file name is converted to lower case unless it contains
one or more lower case letters.</p>

<p>Rx receives a single file with XMODEM or XMODEM-1k
protocol. The user should determine when the 1024 byte block
length actually improves throughput without causing
problems. The user must supply the file name to both sending
and receiving programs. Up to 1023 garbage char- acters may
be added to the received file.</p>

<p>Rz may be invoked as rzCOMMAND (with an optional leading
- as generated by login(1)). For each received file, rz will
pipe the file to COM- MAND filename where filename is the
name of the transmitted file with the file contents as
standard input.</p>

<p>Each file transfer is acknowledged when COMMAND exits
with 0 status. A non zero exit status terminates
transfers.</p>

<p>A typical use for this form is rzrmail which calls
rmail(1) to post mail to the user specified by the
transmitted file name. For example, sending the file
&quot;caf&quot; from a PC-DOS system to rzrmail on a Unix
system would result in the contents of the DOS file
&quot;caf&quot; being mailed to user &quot;caf&quot;.</p>

<p>On some Unix systems, the login directory must contain a
link to COM- MAND as login sets SHELL=rsh which disallows
absolute pathnames. If invoked with a leading v, rz will be
verbose (see v option). The following entry works for Unix
SYS III/V: rzrmail::5:1::/bin:/usr/local/rzrmail If the
SHELL environment variable includes rsh , rbash or rksh
(restricted shell), rz will not accept absolute pathnames or
references to a parent directory, will not modify an
existing file, and removes any files received in error.</p>

<p>If rz is invoked with stdout and stderr to different
datasets, Verbose is set to 2, causing frame by frame
progress reports to stderr. This may be disabled with the q
option.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The meanings of the available options are:</p>

<p>-+, --append append received data to an existing file
(ZMODEM, ASCII only). -a, --ascii Convert files to Unix
conventions by stripping carriage returns and all characters
beginning with the first Control Z (CP/M end of file). -b,
--binary Binary (tell it like it is) file transfer override.
-B NUMBER, --bufsize NUMBER Buffer NUMBER bytes before
writing to disk. Default ist 32768, which should be enough
for most situations. If you have a slow machine or a bad
disk interface or suffer from other hardware problems you
might want to increase the buffersize. -1 or auto use a
buffer large enough to buffer the whole file. Be careful
with this options - things normally get worse, not better,
if the machine starts to swap. -c, --with-crc XMODEM only.
Use 16 bit CRC (normally a one byte checksum is used). -C,
--allow-remote-commands allow remote command execution (
insecure ). This allows the sender to execute an arbitrary
command through system () or execl (). Default is to disable
this feature (?). This option is ignored if running in
restricted mode. -D, --null Output file data to /dev/null;
for testing. (Unix only) --delay-startup N Wait N seconds
before doing anything. -e, --escape Force sender to escape
all control characters; normally XON, XOFF, DLE, CR-@-CR,
and Ctrl-X are escaped. -E, --rename Rename incoming file if
target filename already exists. The new file name will have
a dot and a number (0..999) appended. -h, --help give help
screen. -m N, --min-bps N Stop transmission if BPS-Rate
(Bytes Per Second) falls below N for a certain time (see
--min-bps-time option). -M N, --min-bps-time Used together
with --min-bps. Default is 120 (seconds). -O,
--disable-timeouts Disable read timeout handling code. This
makes lrz hang if the sender does not send any more, but
increases performance (a bit) and decreases system load
(through reducing the number of system calls by about 50
percent).</p>

<p>Use this option with care. --o-sync Open output files in
synchronous write mode. This may be useful if you experience
errors due to lost interrupts if update (or bdflush or
whoever this daemon is called on your system) writes the
buffers to the disk.</p>

<p>This option is ignored and a warning is printed if your
systems doesnt support O_SYNC. -p, --protect (ZMODEM)
Protect: skip file if destination file exists. -q, --quiet
Quiet suppresses verbosity. -r, --resume Crash recovery
mode. lrz tries to resume interrupted file trans- fers. -R,
--restricted Enter more restricted mode. lrz will not create
directories or files with a leading dot if this option is
given twice.</p>

<p>See SECURITY for mode information about restricted mode.
-s HH:MM, --stop-at HH:MM Stop transmission at HH hours, MM
minutes. Another variant, using +N instead of HH:MM, stops
transmission in N seconds. -S, --timesync Request timesync
packet from the sender. The sender sends its system time,
causing lrz to complain about more then 60 seconds
difference.</p>

<p>Lrz tries to set the local system time to the remote
time if this option is given twice (this fails if lrz is not
run by root).</p>

<p>This option makes lrz incompatible with certain other
ZModems. Dont use it unless you know what you are doing.
--syslog[=off] turn syslogging on or off. the default is set
at configure time. This option is ignored if no syslog
support is compiled in. -t TIM, --timeout TIM Change timeout
to TIM tenths of seconds. This is ignored if timeout
handling is turned of through the O option. --tcp-client
ADDRESS:PORT Act as a tcp/ip client: Connect to the given
port.</p>

<p>See --tcp-server for more information.</p>

<p>--tcp-server Act as a server: Open a socket, print out
what to do, wait for connection.</p>

<p>You will normally not want to use this option as lrzsz
is the only zmodem which understands what to do (private
extension). You might want to use this if you have to use
zmodem (for which reason whatever), and cannot use the --tcp
option of lsz (per- haps because your telnet doesnt allow to
spawn a local program with stdin/stdout connected to the
remote side).</p>

<p>If you use this option you have to start lsz with the
--tcp- client ADDRESS:PORT option. lrz will print the
address and port on startup.</p>

<p>Use of this option imposes a security risk, somebody
else could connect to the port in between. See SECURITY for
details. -U, --unrestrict turn off restricted mode (this is
not possible if running under a restricted shell). --version
prints out version number. -v, --verbose Verbose causes a
list of file names to be appended to stderr. More vs
generate more output. -wN, --windowsize N Set window size to
N. -X, --xmodem use XMODEM protocol. -y, --overwrite Yes,
clobber any existing files with the same name. --ymodem use
YMODEM protocol. -Z, --zmodem use ZMODEM protocol.</p>

<p>SECURITY Contrary to the original ZMODEM lrz defaults to
restricted mode. In restricted mode lrz will not accept
absolute pathnames or references to a parent directory, will
not modify an existing file, and removes any files received
in error. Remote command execution is disabled.</p>

<p>To use a more restricted mode set the environment
variable ZMO- DEM_RESTRICTED or give the R option. This
disables creation of subdi- rectories and invisible
files.</p>

<p>Restricted mode may be turned off with the U option,
unless lrz runs under a restricted shell.</p>

<p>Use of the --tcp-client or --tcp-server options imposes
a security risk, as somebody else could connect to the port
before you do it, and grab your data. If theres strong
demand for a more secure mode i might introduce some sort of
password challenge.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT lrz uses the following environment
variables:</p>

<p>SHELL lrz recognizes a restricted shell if this variable
includes rsh or rksh</p>

<p>ZMODEM_RESTRICTED lrz enters the more restricted mode if
the variable is set.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES (Pro-YAM command) &lt;ALT-2&gt; Pro-YAM
Command: sz *.h *.c (This automatically invokes rz on the
connected system.)</p>

<p>Compile time options required for various operating
systems are described in the source file.</p>

<p>NOTES Sending serial data to timesharing minicomputers
at sustained high speeds has been known to cause lockups,
system halts, kernel panics, and occasional antisocial
behaviour. When experimenting with high speed input to a
system, consider rebooting the system if the file transfers
are not successful, especially if the personality of the
sys- tem appears altered.</p>

<p>The Unix &quot;ulimit&quot; parameter must be set high
enough to permit large file transfers.</p>

<p>The TTY input buffering on some systems may not allow
long blocks or streaming input at high speed. You should
suspect this problem when you can t send data to the Unix
system at high speeds using ZMODEM, YMODEM-1k or XMODEM-1k,
when YMODEM with 128 byte blocks works prop- erly. If the
systems tty line handling is really broken, the serial port
or the entire system may not survive the onslaught of long
bursts of high speed data.</p>

<p>The DSZ or Pro-YAM zmodem l numeric parameter may be set
to a value between 64 and 1024 to limit the burst length
(&quot;zmodem pl128&quot;).</p>

<p>BUGS Calling rz from most versions of cu(1) doesn t work
because cus receive process fights rz for characters from
the modem.</p>

<p>Programs that do not properly implement the specified
file transfer protocol may cause sz to &quot;hang&quot; the
port for a minute or two. Every reported instance of this
problem has been corrected by using ZCOMM, Pro-YAM, or other
program with a correct implementation of the speci- fied
protocol.</p>

<p>Many programs claiming to support YMODEM only support
XMODEM with 1k blocks, and they often dont get that quite
right.</p>

<p>Pathnames are restricted to 127 characters. In XMODEM
single file mode, the pathname given on the command line is
still processed as described above. The ASCII option&acute;s
CR/LF to NL translation merely deletes CR&acute;s;
undos(omen) performs a more intelligent translation.</p>

<p>VMS VERSION The VMS version does not set the file
time.</p>

<p>VMS C Standard I/O and RMS may interact to modify file
contents unex- pectedly.</p>

<p>The VMS version does not support invocation as rzCOMMAND
. The current VMS version does not support XMODEM,
XMODEM-1k, or YMODEM.</p>

<p>According to the VMS documentation, the buffered input
routine used on the VMS version of rz introduces a delay of
up to one second for each protocol transaction. This delay
may be significant for very short files. Removing the
&quot;#define BUFREAD&quot; line from rz.c will eliminate
this delay at the expense of increased CPU utilization.</p>

<p>The VMS version causes DCL to generate a random off the
wall error mes- sage under some error conditions; this is a
result of the incompatibil- ity of the VMS &quot;exit&quot;
function with the Unix/MSDOS standard.</p>

<p>ZMODEM CAPABILITIES Rz supports incoming ZMODEM binary
(-b), ASCII (-a), protect (-p), clobber (-y), and append
(-+) requests. The default is protect (-p) and binary
(-b).</p>

<p>The Unix versions support ZMODEM command execution.</p>
