<p>NAME xev - print contents of X events</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS xev [-display displayname] [-geometry geom]
[-bw pixels] [-bs {NotUse- ful,WhenMapped,Always}] [-id
windowid] [-s] [-name string] [-rv]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Xev creates a window and then asks the X
server to send it events when- ever anything happens to the
window (such as it being moved, resized, typed in, clicked
in, etc.). You can also attach it to an existing window. It
is useful for seeing what causes events to occur and to
display the information that they contain; it is essentially
a debug- ging and development tool, and should not be needed
in normal usage.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -display display This option specifies the X
server to contact.</p>

<p>-geometry geom This option specifies the size and/or
location of the window, if a window is to be created.</p>

<p>-bw pixels This option specifies the border width for
the window.</p>

<p>-bs {NotUseful,WhenMapped,Always} This option specifies
what kind of backing store to give the window. The default
is NotUseful. Backing store refers to the the pixels saved
off-screen when the X server maintains the contents of a
window; NotUseful means that the xev process will redraw its
contents itself, as necessary.</p>

<p>-id windowid This option specifies that the window with
the given id should be monitored, instead of creating a new
window.</p>

<p>-s This option specifies that save-unders should be
enabled on the window. Save unders are similar to backing
store, but they refer rather to the saving of pixels
off-screen when the cur- rent window obscures other windows.
Save unders are only advi- sory, and are normally set for
popup dialogs and other tran- sient windows.</p>

<p>-name string This option specifies the name to assign to
the created window.</p>

<p>-rv This option specifies that the window should be in
reverse video.</p>
