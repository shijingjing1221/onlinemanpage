<p>SEM_DESTROY(3) Linux Programmer s Manual
SEM_DESTROY(3)</p>

<p>NAME sem_destroy - destroy an unnamed semaphore</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;semaphore.h&gt;</p>

<p>int sem_destroy(sem_t *sem);</p>

<p>Link with -lrt or -pthread.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION sem_destroy() destroys the unnamed semaphore
at the address pointed to by sem.</p>

<p>Only a semaphore that has been initialized by
sem_init(3) should be destroyed using sem_destroy().</p>

<p>Destroying a semaphore that other processes or threads
are currently blocked on (in sem_wait(3)) produces undefined
behavior.</p>

<p>Using a semaphore that has been destroyed produces
undefined results, until the semaphore has been
reinitialized using sem_init(3).</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE sem_destroy() returns 0 on success; on
error, -1 is returned, and errno is set to indicate the
error.</p>

<p>ERRORS EINVAL sem is not a valid semaphore.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>NOTES An unnamed semaphore should be destroyed with
sem_destroy() before the memory in which it is located is
deallocated. Failure to do this can result in resource leaks
on some implementations.</p>
