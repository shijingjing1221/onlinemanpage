<p>MESG(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual MESG(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME mesg - permit or deny messages</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS mesg [y|n]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The mesg utility shall control whether other
users are allowed to send messages via write, talk, or other
utilities to a terminal device. The terminal device affected
shall be determined by searching for the first terminal in
the sequence of devices associated with standard input,
standard output, and standard error, respectively. With no
arguments, mesg shall report the current state without
changing it. Processes with appropriate privileges may be
able to send messages to the terminal independent of the
current state.</p>

<p>OPTIONS None.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operands shall be supported in
the POSIX locale:</p>

<p>y Grant permission to other users to send messages to
the terminal device.</p>

<p>n Deny permission to other users to send messages to the
terminal device.</p>

<p>STDIN Not used.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of mesg:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in
arguments).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written (by mesg) to stan- dard error.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT If no operand is specified, mesg shall display
the current terminal state in an unspecified format.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 Receiving messages is allowed.</p>

<p>1 Receiving messages is not allowed.</p>

<p>&gt;1 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The mechanism by which the message
status of the terminal is changed is unspecified. Therefore,
unspecified actions may cause the status of the terminal to
change after mesg has successfully completed. These actions
may include, but are not limited to: another invocation of
the mesg utility, login procedures; invocation of the stty
utility, invocation of the chmod utility or chmod()
function, and so on.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The terminal changed by mesg is that
associated with the standard input, output, or error, rather
than the controlling terminal for the session. This is
because users logged in more than once should be able to
change any of their login terminals without having to stop
the job running in those sessions. This is not a security
problem involving the terminals of other users because
appropriate privileges would be required to affect the
terminal of another user.</p>

<p>The method of checking each of the first three file
descriptors in sequence until a terminal is found was
adopted from System V.</p>

<p>The file /dev/tty is not specified for the terminal
device because it was thought to be too restrictive. Typical
environment changes for the n operand are that write
permissions are removed for others and group from the
appropriate device. It was decided to leave the actual
description of what is done as unspecified because of
potential differ- ences between implementations.</p>

<p>The format for standard output is unspecified because of
differences between historical implementations. This output
is generally not useful to shell scripts (they can use the
exit status), so exact parsing of the output is
unnecessary.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
