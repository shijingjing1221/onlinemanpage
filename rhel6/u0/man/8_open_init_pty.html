<p>NAME open_init_pty - run an program under a psuedo
terminal</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS open_init_pty SCRIPT [[ARGS]...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Run a program under a psuedo terminal. This
is used by run_init to run actually run the program after
setting up the proper context. This pro- gram acquires a new
Psuedo terminal, forks a child process that binds to the
psueado terminal, and then sits around and connects the
physical terminal it was invoked upon with the pseudo
terminal, passing keyboard input into to the child process,
and passing the output of the child process to the physical
terminal.</p>

<p>It sets up the pseudo terminal properly based on the
physical terminal attributes, and then sets the users
terminal to RAW mode, taking care to reset it on exit.</p>
