<p>MAILADDR(7) Linux User s Manual MAILADDR(7)</p>

<p>NAME mailaddr - mail addressing description</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page gives a brief introduction
to SMTP mail addresses, as used on the Internet. These
addresses are in the general format</p>

<p>user@domain</p>

<p>where a domain is a hierarchical dot-separated list of
subdomains. These examples are valid forms of the same
address:</p>

<p>eric@monet.berkeley.edu Eric Allman
&lt;eric@monet.berkeley.edu&gt; eric@monet.berkeley.edu
(Eric Allman)</p>

<p>The domain part (&quot;monet.berkeley.edu&quot;) is a
mail-accepting domain. It can be a host and in the past it
usually was, but it doesnt have to be. The domain part is
not case sensitive.</p>

<p>The local part (&quot;eric&quot;) is often a username,
but its meaning is defined by the local software. Sometimes
it is case sensitive, although that is unusual. If you see a
local-part that looks like garbage, it is usually because of
a gateway between an internal e-mail system and the net,
here are some examples:</p>


<p>&quot;surname/admd=telemail/c=us/o=hp/prmd=hp&quot;@some.where
USER%SOMETHING@some.where machine!machine!name@some.where
I2461572@some.where</p>

<p>(These are, respectively, an X.400 gateway, a gateway to
an arbitrary internal mail system that lacks proper internet
support, an UUCP gateway, and the last one is just boring
username policy.)</p>

<p>The real-name part (&quot;Eric Allman&quot;) can either
be placed before &lt;&gt;, or in () at the end. (Strictly
speaking the two arent the same, but the difference is
beyond the scope of this page.) The name may have to be
quoted using &quot;&quot;, for example, if it contains
&quot;.&quot;:</p>

<p>&quot;Eric P. Allman&quot;
&lt;eric@monet.berkeley.edu&gt;</p>

<p>Abbreviation. Many mail systems let users abbreviate the
domain name. For instance, users at berkeley.edu may get
away with &quot;eric@monet&quot; to send mail to Eric
Allman. This behavior is deprecated. Sometimes it works, but
you should not depend on it.</p>

<p>Route-addrs. In the past, sometimes one had to route a
message through several hosts to get it to its final
destination. Addresses which show these relays are termed
&quot;route-addrs&quot;. These use the syntax:</p>

<p>&lt;@hosta,@hostb:user@hostc&gt;</p>

<p>This specifies that the message should be sent to hosta,
from there to hostb, and finally to hostc. Many hosts
disregard route-addrs and send directly to hostc.</p>

<p>Route-addrs are very unusual now. They occur sometimes
in old mail archives. It is generally possible to ignore all
but the &quot;user@hostc&quot; part of the address to
determine the actual address.</p>

<p>Postmaster. Every site is required to have a user or
user alias designated &quot;postmaster&quot; to which
problems with the mail system may be addressed. The
&quot;postmaster&quot; address is not case sensitive.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/aliases ~/.forward</p>

forward(5), sendmail(8), vrfy(8)</p>
