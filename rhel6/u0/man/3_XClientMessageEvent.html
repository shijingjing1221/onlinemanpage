<p>XClientMessageEvent(3) XLIB FUNCTIONS
XClientMessageEvent(3)</p>

<p>NAME XClientMessageEvent - ClientMessage event
structure</p>

<p>STRUCTURES The structure for ClientMessage events
contains:</p>

<p>typedef struct { int type; /* ClientMessage */ unsigned
long serial; /* # of last request processed by server */
Bool send_event; /* true if this came from a SendEvent
request */ Display *display; /* Display the event was read
from */ Window window; Atom message_type; int format; union
{ char b[20]; short s[10]; long l[5]; } data; }
XClientMessageEvent;</p>

<p>When you receive this event, the structure members are
set as follows.</p>

<p>The type member is set to the event type constant name
that uniquely identifies it. For example, when the X server
reports a GraphicsExpose event to a client application, it
sends an XGraphicsExposeEvent struc- ture with the type
member set to GraphicsExpose. The display member is set to a
pointer to the display the event was read on. The send_event
member is set to True if the event came from a SendEvent
protocol request. The serial member is set from the serial
number reported in the protocol but expanded from the 16-bit
least-significant bits to a full 32-bit value. The window
member is set to the window that is most useful to toolkit
dispatchers.</p>

<p>The message_type member is set to an atom that indicates
how the data should be interpreted by the receiving client.
The format member is set to 8, 16, or 32 and specifies
whether the data should be viewed as a list of bytes,
shorts, or longs. The data member is a union that contains
the members b, s, and l. The b, s, and l members represent
data of twenty 8-bit values, ten 16-bit values, and five
32-bit values. Particular message types might not make use
of all these values. The X server places no interpretation
on the values in the window, mes- sage_type, or data
members.</p>
