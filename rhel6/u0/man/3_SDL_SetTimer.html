<p>SDL_SetTimer(3) SDL API Reference SDL_SetTimer(3)</p>

<p>NAME SDL_SetTimer - Set a callback to run after the
specified number of mil- liseconds has elapsed.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &quot;SDL.h&quot;</p>

<p>int SDL_SetTimer(Uint32 interval, SDL_TimerCallback
callback);</p>

<p>CALLBACK /* Function prototype for the timer callback
function */ typedef Uint32 (*SDL_TimerCallback)(Uint32
interval);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Set a callback to run after the specified
number of milliseconds has elapsed. The callback function is
passed the current timer interval and returns the next timer
interval. If the returned value is the same as the one
passed in, the periodic alarm continues, otherwise a new
alarm is scheduled.</p>

<p>To cancel a currently running timer, call
SDL_SetTimer(0, NULL);</p>

<p>The timer callback function may run in a different
thread than your main constant, and so shouldnt call any
functions from within itself.</p>

<p>The maximum resolution of this timer is 10 ms, which
means that if you request a 16 ms timer, your callback will
run approximately 20 ms later on an unloaded system. If you
wanted to set a flag signaling a frame update at 30 frames
per second (every 33 ms), you might set a timer for 30 ms
(see example below).</p>

<p>If you use this function, you need to pass
SDL_INIT_TIMER to SDL_Init().</p>

<p>Note:</p>

<p>This function is kept for compatibility but has been
superseded by the new timer functions SDL_AddTimer and
SDL_RemoveTimer which support multiple timers.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES SDL_SetTimer((33/10)*10, my_callback);</p>

<p>SEE ALSO SDL_AddTimer</p>
