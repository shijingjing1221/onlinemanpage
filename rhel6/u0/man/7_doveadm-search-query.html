<p>NAME doveadm-search-query - Overview of search queries
for doveadm mailbox commands</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Several doveadm(1) commands use a
search_query in order to act only on matching messages. This
manual page describes all SEARCH KEYS, which can be used in
a search_query.</p>

<p>Each search_query consists at least of one SEARCH KEY.
Most of the SEARCH KEYS require an argument. All SEARCH KEYS
are case-insensitive. The shortest valid search_query is
ALL. For example:</p>

<p>doveadm search ALL</p>

<p>Multiple search query expressions will be combined with
the AND opera- tor by default. To find all messages that are
new and greater than 50 kilobyte, one can use:</p>

<p>doveadm search NEW LARGER 50k</p>

<p>OR-ed SEARCH KEYS have to be written in parenthesis,
when mixing ANDs and ORs. Shells commonly require escaping
for parentheses. To find messages that were saved on the
&quot;13th of April 2007&quot; AND have the n and/or agged
flag set, one can use for example:</p>

<p>doveadm search SAVEDON 2007-04-13 SEEN OR FLAGGED</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also possible to specify the mailbox, in
which should be searched. Use either the keyword mailbox and
the name of the mailbox or the key- word mailbox-guid and
the mailbox&rsquo;s globally unique identifier at the
beginning of the search_query. To find all messages in the
mailbox with the GUID
&quot;44f68b13ce97044b837f000035ca9452&quot; use:</p>

<p>doveadm search mailbox-guid
44f68b13ce97044b837f000035ca9452 ALL</p>

<p>To list all deleted messages in the &quot;Trash&quot;
folder use:</p>

<p>doveadm search mailbox Trash DELETED</p>
