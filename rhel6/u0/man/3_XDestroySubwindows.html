<p>XDestroyWindow(3) XLIB FUNCTIONS XDestroyWindow(3)</p>

<p>NAME XDestroyWindow, XDestroySubwindows - destroy
windows</p>

<p>SYNTAX int XDestroyWindow(Display *display, Window
w);</p>

<p>int XDestroySubwindows(Display *display, Window w);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS display Specifies the connection to the X
server.</p>

<p>w Specifies the window.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The XDestroyWindow function destroys the
specified window as well as all of its subwindows and causes
the X server to generate a DestroyNo- tify event for each
window. The window should never be referenced again. If the
window specified by the w argument is mapped, it is unmapped
automatically. The ordering of the DestroyNotify events is
such that for any given window being destroyed,
DestroyNotify is gener- ated on any inferiors of the window
before being generated on the win- dow itself. The ordering
among siblings and across subhierarchies is not otherwise
constrained. If the window you specified is a root win- dow,
no windows are destroyed. Destroying a mapped window will
gener- ate Expose events on other windows that were obscured
by the window being destroyed.</p>

<p>XDestroyWindow can generate a BadWindow error.</p>

<p>The XDestroySubwindows function destroys all inferior
windows of the specified window, in bottom-to-top stacking
order. It causes the X server to generate a DestroyNotify
event for each window. If any mapped subwindows were
actually destroyed, XDestroySubwindows causes the X server
to generate Expose events on the specified window. This is
much more efficient than deleting many windows one at a time
because much of the work need be performed only once for all
of the windows, rather than for each window. The subwindows
should never be referenced again.</p>

<p>XDestroySubwindows can generate a BadWindow error.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS BadWindow A value for a Window argument does
not name a defined Window.</p>
