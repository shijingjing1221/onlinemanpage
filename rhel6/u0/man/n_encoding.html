<p>NAME encoding - Manipulate encodings</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS encoding option ?arg arg ...?
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION Strings in Tcl are encoded using 16-bit
Unicode characters. Different operating system interfaces or
applications may generate strings in other encodings such as
Shift-JIS. The encoding command helps to bridge the gap
between Unicode and these other formats.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Performs one of several encoding related
operations, depending on option. The legal options are:</p>

<p>encoding convertfrom ?encoding? data Convert data to
Unicode from the specified encoding. The char- acters in
data are treated as binary data where the lower 8-bits of
each character is taken as a single byte. The resulting
sequence of bytes is treated as a string in the specified
encod- ing. If encoding is not specified, the current system
encoding is used.</p>

<p>encoding convertto ?encoding? string Convert string from
Unicode to the specified encoding. The result is a sequence
of bytes that represents the converted string. Each byte is
stored in the lower 8-bits of a Unicode character. If
encoding is not specified, the current system encoding is
used.</p>

<p>encoding dirs ?directoryList? Tcl can load encoding data
files from the file system that describe additional
encodings for it to work with. This command sets the search
path for *.enc encoding data files to the list of
directories directoryList. If directoryList is omitted then
the command returns the current list of directories that
make up the search path. It is an error for directoryList to
not be a valid list. If, when a search for an encoding data
file is hap- pening, an element in directoryList does not
refer to a read- able, searchable directory, that element is
ignored.</p>

<p>encoding names Returns a list containing the names of
all of the encodings that are currently available.</p>

<p>encoding system ?encoding? Set the system encoding to
encoding. If encoding is omitted then the command returns
the current system encoding. The system encoding is used
whenever Tcl passes strings to system calls.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE It is common practice to write script files
using a text editor that produces output in the euc-jp
encoding, which represents the ASCII characters as singe
bytes and Japanese characters as two bytes. This makes it
easy to embed literal strings that correspond to non-ASCII
characters by simply typing the strings in place in the
script. How- ever, because the source command always reads
files using the current system encoding, Tcl will only
source such files correctly when the encoding used to write
the file is the same. This tends not to be true in an
internationalized setting. For example, if such a file was
sourced in North America (where the ISO8859-1 is normally
used), each byte in the file would be treated as a separate
character that maps to the 00 page in Unicode. The resulting
Tcl strings will not contain the expected Japanese
characters. Instead, they will contain a sequence of Latin-1
characters that correspond to the bytes of the original
string. The encoding command can be used to convert this
string to the expected Japanese Unicode characters. For
example, set s [encoding convertfrom euc-jp &quot;] would
return the Unicode string 306F , which is the Hiragana
letter HA.</p>
