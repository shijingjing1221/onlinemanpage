<p>Tcl_CallWhenDeleted(3) Tcl Library Procedures
Tcl_CallWhenDeleted(3)</p>


<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME Tcl_CallWhenDeleted, Tcl_DontCallWhenDeleted -
Arrange for callback when interpreter is deleted</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tcl.h&gt;</p>

<p>Tcl_CallWhenDeleted(interp, proc, clientData)</p>

<p>Tcl_DontCallWhenDeleted(interp, proc, clientData)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS Tcl_Interp *interp (in) Interpreter with which
to associated callback.</p>

<p>Tcl_InterpDeleteProc *proc (in) Procedure to call when
interp is deleted.</p>

<p>ClientData clientData (in) Arbitrary one-word value to
pass to proc.
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Tcl_CallWhenDeleted arranges for proc to be
called by Tcl_DeleteInterp if/when interp is deleted at some
future time. Proc will be invoked just before the
interpreter is deleted, but the interpreter will still be
valid at the time of the call. Proc should have arguments
and result that match the type Tcl_InterpDeleteProc: typedef
void Tcl_InterpDeleteProc( ClientData clientData, Tcl_Interp
*interp); The clientData and interp parameters are copies of
the clientData and interp arguments given to
Tcl_CallWhenDeleted. Typically, clientData points to an
application-specific data structure that proc uses to per-
form cleanup when an interpreter is about to go away. Proc
does not return a value.</p>

<p>Tcl_DontCallWhenDeleted cancels a previous call to
Tcl_CallWhenDeleted with the same arguments, so that proc
will not be called after all when interp is deleted. If
there is no deletion callback that matches interp, proc, and
clientData then the call to Tcl_DontCallWhenDeleted has no
effect.</p>

<p>KEYWORDS callback, delete, interpreter</p>
