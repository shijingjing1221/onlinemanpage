<p>USB_EP_ENABLE(9) Kernel Mode Gadget API
USB_EP_ENABLE(9)</p>

<p>NAME usb_ep_enable - configure endpoint, making it
usable</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS int usb_ep_enable(struct usb_ep * ep, const
struct usb_endpoint_descriptor * desc);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS ep the endpoint being configured. may not be
the endpoint named ep0. drivers discover endpoints through
the ep_list of a usb_gadget.</p>

<p>desc descriptor for desired behavior. caller guarantees
this pointer remains valid until the endpoint is disabled;
the data byte order is little-endian (usb-standard).</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION when configurations are set, or when
interface settings change, the driver will enable or disable
the relevant endpoints. while it is enabled, an endpoint may
be used for i/o until the driver receives a disconnect from
the host or until the endpoint is disabled.</p>

<p>the ep0 implementation (which calls this routine) must
ensure that the hardware capabilities of each endpoint match
the descriptor provided for it. for example, an endpoint
named ep2in-bulk would be usable for interrupt transfers as
well as bulk, but it likely couldn&acute;t be used for iso
transfers or for endpoint 14. some endpoints are fully
configurable, with more generic names like ep-a. (remember
that for USB, in means towards the USB master.)</p>

<p>returns zero, or a negative error code.</p>
