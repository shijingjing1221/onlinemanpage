<p>GIT-FILTER-BRANCH(1) Git Manual GIT-FILTER-BRANCH(1)</p>

<p>NAME git-filter-branch - Rewrite branches</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS git filter-branch [--env-filter
&lt;command&gt;] [--tree-filter &lt;command&gt;]
[--index-filter &lt;command&gt;] [--parent-filter
&lt;command&gt;] [--msg-filter &lt;command&gt;]
[--commit-filter &lt;command&gt;] [--tag-name-filter
&lt;command&gt;] [--subdirectory-filter &lt;directory&gt;]
[--prune-empty] [--original &lt;namespace&gt;] [-d
&lt;directory&gt;] [-f | --force] [--] [&lt;rev-list
options&gt;...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Lets you rewrite git revision history by
rewriting the branches mentioned in the &lt;rev-list
options&gt;, applying custom filters on each revision. Those
filters can modify each tree (e.g. removing a file or
running a perl rewrite on all files) or information about
each commit. Otherwise, all information (including original
commit times or merge information) will be preserved.</p>

<p>The command will only rewrite the positive refs
mentioned in the command line (e.g. if you pass a..b, only b
will be rewritten). If you specify no filters, the commits
will be recommitted without any changes, which would
normally have no effect. Nevertheless, this may be useful in
the future for compensating for some git bugs or such,
therefore such a usage is permitted.</p>

<p>NOTE: This command honors .git/info/grafts. If you have
any grafts defined, running this command will make them
permanent.</p>

<p>WARNING! The rewritten history will have different
object names for all the objects and will not converge with
the original branch. You will not be able to easily push and
distribute the rewritten branch on top of the original
branch. Please do not use this command if you do not know
the full implications, and avoid using it anyway, if a
simple single commit would suffice to fix your problem. (See
the &quot;RECOVERING FROM UPSTREAM REBASE&quot; section in
git-rebase(1) for further information about rewriting
published history.)</p>

<p>Always verify that the rewritten version is correct: The
original refs, if different from the rewritten ones, will be
stored in the namespace refs/original/.</p>

<p>Note that since this operation is very I/O expensive, it
might be a good idea to redirect the temporary directory
off-disk with the -d option, e.g. on tmpfs. Reportedly the
speedup is very noticeable.</p>

<p>Filters The filters are applied in the order as listed
below. The &lt;command&gt; argument is always evaluated in
the shell context using the eval command (with the notable
exception of the commit filter, for technical reasons).
Prior to that, the $GIT_COMMIT environment variable will be
set to contain the id of the commit being rewritten. Also,
GIT_AUTHOR_NAME, GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL, GIT_AUTHOR_DATE,
GIT_COMMITTER_NAME, GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL, and
GIT_COMMITTER_DATE are set according to the current commit.
The values of these variables after the filters have run,
are used for the new commit. If any evaluation of
&lt;command&gt; returns a non-zero exit status, the whole
operation will be aborted.</p>

<p>A map function is available that takes an &quot;original
sha1 id&quot; argument and outputs a &quot;rewritten sha1
id&quot; if the commit has been already rewritten, and
&quot;original sha1 id&quot; otherwise; the map function can
return several ids on separate lines if your commit filter
emitted multiple commits.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --env-filter &lt;command&gt; This filter may be
used if you only need to modify the environment in which the
commit will be performed. Specifically, you might want to
rewrite the author/committer name/email/time environment
variables (see git-commit(1) for details). Do not forget to
re-export the variables.</p>

<p>--tree-filter &lt;command&gt; This is the filter for
rewriting the tree and its contents. The argument is
evaluated in shell with the working directory set to the
root of the checked out tree. The new tree is then used
as-is (new files are auto-added, disappeared files are
auto-removed - neither .gitignore files nor any other ignore
rules HAVE ANY EFFECT!).</p>

<p>--index-filter &lt;command&gt; This is the filter for
rewriting the index. It is similar to the tree filter but
does not check out the tree, which makes it much faster.
Frequently used with git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch ...,
see EXAMPLES below. For hairy cases, see
git-update-index(1).</p>

<p>--parent-filter &lt;command&gt; This is the filter for
rewriting the commits parent list. It will receive the
parent string on stdin and shall output the new parent
string on stdout. The parent string is in the format
described in git-commit-tree(1): empty for the initial
commit, &quot;-p parent&quot; for a normal commit and
&quot;-p parent1 -p parent2 -p parent3 ...&quot; for a merge
commit.</p>

<p>--msg-filter &lt;command&gt; This is the filter for
rewriting the commit messages. The argument is evaluated in
the shell with the original commit message on standard
input; its standard output is used as the new commit
message.</p>

<p>--commit-filter &lt;command&gt; This is the filter for
performing the commit. If this filter is specified, it will
be called instead of the git commit-tree command, with
arguments of the form &quot;&lt;TREE_ID&gt; [-p
&lt;PARENT_COMMIT_ID&gt;]...&quot; and the log message on
stdin. The commit id is expected on stdout.</p>

<p>As a special extension, the commit filter may emit
multiple commit ids; in that case, the rewritten children of
the original commit will have all of them as parents.</p>

<p>You can use the map convenience function in this filter,
and other convenience functions, too. For example, calling
skip_commit &quot;$@&quot; will leave out the current commit
(but not its changes! If you want that, use git rebase
instead).</p>

<p>You can also use the git_commit_non_empty_tree
&quot;$@&quot; instead of git commit-tree &quot;$@&quot; if
you dont wish to keep commits with a single parent and that
makes no change to the tree.</p>

<p>--tag-name-filter &lt;command&gt; This is the filter for
rewriting tag names. When passed, it will be called for
every tag ref that points to a rewritten object (or to a tag
object which points to a rewritten object). The original tag
name is passed via standard input, and the new tag name is
expected on standard output.</p>

<p>The original tags are not deleted, but can be
overwritten; use &quot;--tag-name-filter cat&quot; to simply
update the tags. In this case, be very careful and make sure
you have the old tags backed up in case the conversion has
run afoul.</p>

<p>Nearly proper rewriting of tag objects is supported. If
the tag has a message attached, a new tag object will be
created with the same message, author, and timestamp. If the
tag has a signature attached, the signature will be
stripped. It is by definition impossible to preserve
signatures. The reason this is &quot;nearly&quot; proper, is
because ideally if the tag did not change (points to the
same object, has the same name, etc.) it should retain any
signature. That is not the case, signatures will always be
removed, buyer beware. There is also no support for changing
the author or timestamp (or the tag message for that
matter). Tags which point to other tags will be rewritten to
point to the underlying commit.</p>

<p>--subdirectory-filter &lt;directory&gt; Only look at the
history which touches the given subdirectory. The result
will contain that directory (and only that) as its project
root. Implies --remap-to-ancestor.</p>

<p>--remap-to-ancestor Rewrite refs to the nearest
rewritten ancestor instead of ignoring them.</p>

<p>Normally, positive refs on the command line are only
changed if the commit they point to was rewritten. However,
you can limit the extent of this rewriting by using
rev-list(1) arguments, e.g., path limiters. Refs pointing to
such excluded commits would then normally be ignored. With
this option, they are instead rewritten to point at the
nearest ancestor that was not excluded.</p>

<p>--prune-empty Some kind of filters will generate empty
commits, that left the tree untouched. This switch allow
git-filter-branch to ignore such commits. Though, this
switch only applies for commits that have one and only one
parent, it will hence keep merges points. Also, this option
is not compatible with the use of --commit-filter. Though
you just need to use the function git_commit_non_empty_tree
&quot;$@&quot; instead of the git commit-tree &quot;$@&quot;
idiom in your commit filter to make that happen.</p>

<p>--original &lt;namespace&gt; Use this option to set the
namespace where the original commits will be stored. The
default value is refs/original.</p>

<p>-d &lt;directory&gt; Use this option to set the path to
the temporary directory used for rewriting. When applying a
tree filter, the command needs to temporarily check out the
tree to some directory, which may consume considerable space
in case of large projects. By default it does this in the
.git-rewrite/ directory but you can override that choice by
this parameter.</p>

<p>-f, --force</p>

<p>git filter-branch refuses to start with an existing
temporary directory or when there are already refs starting
with refs/original/, unless forced.</p>

<p>&lt;rev-list options&gt;... Arguments for git rev-list.
All positive refs included by these options are rewritten.
You may also specify options such as --all, but you must use
-- to separate them from the git filter-branch options.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Suppose you want to remove a file (containing
confidential information or copyright violation) from all
commits:</p>

<p>git filter-branch --tree-filter &acute;rm
filename&acute; HEAD</p>

<p>However, if the file is absent from the tree of some
commit, a simple rm filename will fail for that tree and
commit. Thus you may instead want to use rm -f filename as
the script.</p>

<p>Using --index-filter with git rm yields a significantly
faster version. Like with using rm filename, git rm --cached
filename will fail if the file is absent from the tree of a
commit. If you want to &quot;completely forget&quot; a file,
it does not matter when it entered history, so we also add
--ignore-unmatch:</p>

<p>git filter-branch --index-filter &acute;git rm --cached
--ignore-unmatch filename&acute; HEAD</p>

<p>Now, you will get the rewritten history saved in
HEAD.</p>

<p>To rewrite the repository to look as if foodir/ had been
its project root, and discard all other history:</p>

<p>git filter-branch --subdirectory-filter foodir --
--all</p>

<p>Thus you can, e.g., turn a library subdirectory into a
repository of its own. Note the -- that separates
filter-branch options from revision options, and the --all
to rewrite all branches and tags.</p>

<p>To set a commit (which typically is at the tip of
another history) to be the parent of the current initial
commit, in order to paste the other history behind the
current history:</p>

<p>git filter-branch --parent-filter &acute;sed &quot;s/^-p
&lt;graft-id&gt;/&quot;&acute; HEAD</p>

<p>(if the parent string is empty - which happens when we
are dealing with the initial commit - add graftcommit as a
parent). Note that this assumes history with a single root
(that is, no merge without common ancestors happened). If
this is not the case, use:</p>

<p>git filter-branch --parent-filter &acute;test
$GIT_COMMIT = &lt;commit-id&gt; &amp;&amp; echo &quot;-p
&lt;graft-id&gt;&quot; || cat&acute; HEAD</p>

<p>or even simpler:</p>

<p>echo &quot;$commit-id $graft-id&quot; &gt;&gt;
.git/info/grafts git filter-branch $graft-id..HEAD</p>

<p>To remove commits authored by &quot;Darl McBribe&quot;
from the history:</p>

<p>git filter-branch --commit-filter &acute; if [
&quot;$GIT_AUTHOR_NAME&quot; = &quot;Darl McBribe&quot; ];
then skip_commit &quot;$@&quot;; else git commit-tree
&quot;$@&quot;; fi&acute; HEAD</p>

<p>The function skip_commit is defined as follows:</p>

<p>skip_commit() { shift; while [ -n &quot;$1&quot; ]; do
shift; map &quot;$1&quot;; shift; done; }</p>

<p>The shift magic first throws away the tree id and then
the -p parameters. Note that this handles merges properly!
In case Darl committed a merge between P1 and P2, it will be
propagated properly and all children of the merge will
become merge commits with P1,P2 as their parents instead of
the merge commit.</p>

<p>You can rewrite the commit log messages using
--msg-filter. For example, git svn-id strings in a
repository created by git svn can be removed this way:</p>

<p>git filter-branch --msg-filter &acute; sed -e
&quot;/^git-svn-id:/d&quot; &acute;</p>

<p>To restrict rewriting to only part of the history,
specify a revision range in addition to the new branch name.
The new branch name will point to the top-most revision that
a git rev-list of this range will print.</p>

<p>If you need to add Acked-by lines to, say, the last 10
commits (none of which is a merge), use this command:</p>

<p>git filter-branch --msg-filter &acute; cat &amp;&amp;
echo &quot;Acked-by: Bugs Bunny
&lt;bunny@bugzilla.org&gt;&quot; &acute; HEAD~10..HEAD</p>

<p>NOTE the changes introduced by the commits, and which
are not reverted by subsequent commits, will still be in the
rewritten branch. If you want to throw out changes together
with the commits, you should use the interactive mode of git
rebase.</p>

<p>Consider this history:</p>

<p>D--E--F--G--H / / A--B-----C</p>

<p>To rewrite only commits D,E,F,G,H, but leave A, B and C
alone, use:</p>

<p>git filter-branch ... C..H</p>

<p>To rewrite commits E,F,G,H, use one of these:</p>

<p>git filter-branch ... C..H --not D git filter-branch ...
D..H --not C</p>

<p>To move the whole tree into a subdirectory, or remove it
from there:</p>

<p>git filter-branch --index-filter &acute;git ls-files -s
| sed &quot;s- GIT_INDEX_FILE=$GIT_INDEX_FILE.new git
update-index --index-info &amp;&amp; mv $GIT_INDEX_FILE.new
$GIT_INDEX_FILE&acute; HEAD</p>

<p>CHECKLIST FOR SHRINKING A REPOSITORY git-filter-branch
is often used to get rid of a subset of files, usually with
some combination of --index-filter and
--subdirectory-filter. People expect the resulting
repository to be smaller than the original, but you need a
few more steps to actually make it smaller, because git
tries hard not to lose your objects until you tell it to.
First make sure that:</p>

<p>&middot; You really removed all variants of a filename,
if a blob was moved over its lifetime. git log --name-only
--follow --all -- filename can help you find renames.</p>

<p>&middot; You really filtered all refs: use
--tag-name-filter cat -- --all when calling
git-filter-branch.</p>

<p>Then there are two ways to get a smaller repository. A
safer way is to clone, that keeps your original intact.</p>

<p>&middot; Clone it with git clone file:///path/to/repo.
The clone will not have the removed objects. See
git-clone(1). (Note that cloning with a plain path just
hardlinks everything!)</p>

<p>If you really dont want to clone it, for whatever
reasons, check the following points instead (in this order).
This is a very destructive approach, so make a backup or go
back to cloning it. You have been warned.</p>

<p>&middot; Remove the original refs backed up by
git-filter-branch: say git for-each-ref
--format=&quot;%(refname)&quot; refs/original/ | xargs -n 1
git update-ref -d.</p>

<p>&middot; Expire all reflogs with git reflog expire
--expire=now --all.</p>

<p>&middot; Garbage collect all unreferenced objects with
git gc --prune=now (or if your git-gc is not new enough to
support arguments to --prune, use git repack -ad; git prune
instead).</p>
