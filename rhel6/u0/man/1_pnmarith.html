<p>NAME pnmarith - perform arithmetic on two PNM images</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>Starting with Netpbm 10.3, pnmarith is obsolete. Use
pamarith(1)instead.</p>

<p>pamarith is backward compatible with pnmarith except
where your input images have different depths. pnmarith
would convert the one with the lesser depth to have the
higher depth before doing the arithmetic. With pamarith, you
must do that step separately, using pgmtoppm.</p>
