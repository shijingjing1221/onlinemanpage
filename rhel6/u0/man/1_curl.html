<p>NAME curl - transfer a URL</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS curl [options] [URL...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION curl is a tool to transfer data from or to a
server, using one of the supported protocols (HTTP, HTTPS,
FTP, FTPS, SCP, SFTP, TFTP, DICT, TELNET, LDAP or FILE). The
command is designed to work without user interaction.</p>

<p>curl offers a busload of useful tricks like proxy
support, user authen- tication, FTP upload, HTTP post, SSL
connections, cookies, file trans- fer resume and more. As
you will see below, the number of features will make your
head spin!</p>

<p>curl is powered by libcurl for all transfer-related
features. See libcurl(3) for details.</p>

<p>URL The URL syntax is protocol-dependent. You ll find a
detailed descrip- tion in RFC 3986.</p>

<p>You can specify multiple URLs or parts of URLs by
writing part sets within braces as in:</p>

<p>http://site.{one,two,three}.com</p>

<p>or you can get sequences of alphanumeric series by using
[] as in:</p>

<p>ftp://ftp.numericals.com/file[1-100].txt
ftp://ftp.numericals.com/file[001-100].txt (with leading
zeros) ftp://ftp.letters.com/file[a-z].txt</p>

<p>No nesting of the sequences is supported at the moment,
but you can use several ones next to each other:</p>


<p>http://any.org/archive[1996-1999]/vol[1-4]/part{a,b,c}.html</p>

<p>You can specify any amount of URLs on the command line.
They will be fetched in a sequential manner in the specified
order.</p>

<p>Since curl 7.15.1 you can also specify a step counter
for the ranges, so that you can get every Nth number or
letter:</p>

<p>http://www.numericals.com/file[1-100:10].txt
http://www.letters.com/file[a-z:2].txt</p>

<p>If you specify URL without protocol:// prefix, curl will
attempt to guess what protocol you might want. It will then
default to HTTP but try other protocols based on often-used
host name prefixes. For exam- ple, for host names starting
with &quot;ftp.&quot; curl will assume you want to speak
FTP.</p>

<p>curl will do its best to use what you pass to it as a
URL. It is not trying to validate it as a syntactically
correct URL by any means but is instead very liberal with
what it accepts.</p>

<p>Curl will attempt to re-use connections for multiple
file transfers, so that getting many files from the same
server will not do multiple con- nects / handshakes. This
improves speed. Of course this is only done on files
specified on a single command line and cannot be used
between separate curl invokes.</p>

<p>PROGRESS METER curl normally displays a progress meter
during operations, indicating the amount of transferred
data, transfer speeds and estimated time left, etc.</p>

<p>However, since curl displays this data to the terminal
by default, if you invoke curl to do an operation and it is
about to write data to the terminal, it disables the
progress meter as otherwise it would mess up the output
mixing progress meter and response data.</p>

<p>If you want a progress meter for HTTP POST or PUT
requests, you need to redirect the response output to a
file, using shell redirect (&gt;), -o [file] or similar.</p>

<p>It is not the same case for FTP upload as that operation
does not spit out any response data to the terminal.</p>

<p>If you prefer a progress &quot;bar&quot; instead of the
regular meter, -# is your friend.</p>

<p>OPTIONS In general, all boolean options are enabled with
--option and yet again disabled with --no-option. That is,
you use the exact same option name but prefix it with
&quot;no-&quot;. However, in this list we mostly only list
and show the --option version of them. (This concept with
--no options was added in 7.19.0. Previously most options
were toggled on/off on repeated use of the same command line
option.)</p>

<p>-a/--append (FTP/SFTP) When used in an upload, this will
tell curl to append to the target file instead of
overwriting it. If the file doesn t exist, it will be
created. Note that this flag is ignored by some SSH servers
(including OpenSSH).</p>

<p>-A/--user-agent &lt;agent string&gt; (HTTP) Specify the
User-Agent string to send to the HTTP server. Some badly
done CGIs fail if this field isnt set to
&quot;Mozilla/4.0&quot;. To encode blanks in the string,
surround the string with single quote marks. This can also
be set with the -H/--header option of course.</p>

<p>If this option is set more than once, the last one will
be the one thats used.</p>

<p>--anyauth (HTTP) Tells curl to figure out authentication
method by itself, and use the most secure one the remote
site claims to support. This is done by first doing a
request and checking the response- headers, thus possibly
inducing an extra network round-trip. This is used instead
of setting a specific authentication method, which you can
do with --basic, --digest, --ntlm, and --negotiate.</p>

<p>Note that using --anyauth is not recommended if you do
uploads from stdin, since it may require data to be sent
twice and then the client must be able to rewind. If the
need should arise when uploading from stdin, the upload
operation will fail.</p>

<p>-b/--cookie &lt;name=data&gt; (HTTP) Pass the data to
the HTTP server as a cookie. It is sup- posedly the data
previously received from the server in a &quot;Set-
Cookie:&quot; line. The data should be in the format
&quot;NAME1=VALUE1; NAME2=VALUE2&quot;.</p>

<p>If no = symbol is used in the line, it is treated as a
file- name to use to read previously stored cookie lines
from, which should be used in this session if they match.
Using this method also activates the &quot;cookie
parser&quot; which will make curl record incoming cookies
too, which may be handy if you re using this in combination
with the -L/--location option. The file format of the file
to read cookies from should be plain HTTP headers or the
Netscape/Mozilla cookie file format.</p>

<p>NOTE that the file specified with -b/--cookie is only
used as input. No cookies will be stored in the file. To
store cookies, use the -c/--cookie-jar option or you could
even save the HTTP headers to a file using
-D/--dump-header!</p>

<p>If this option is set more than once, the last one will
be the one thats used.</p>

<p>-B/--use-ascii Enable ASCII transfer when using FTP or
LDAP. For FTP, this can also be enforced by using an URL
that ends with &quot;;type=A&quot;. This option causes data
sent to stdout to be in text mode for win32 systems.</p>

<p>--basic (HTTP) Tells curl to use HTTP Basic
authentication. This is the default and this option is
usually pointless, unless you use it to override a
previously set option that sets a different authentication
method (such as --ntlm, --digest, or --negoti- ate).</p>

<p>--ciphers &lt;list of ciphers&gt; (SSL) Specifies which
ciphers to use in the connection. The list of ciphers must
specify valid ciphers. Read up on SSL cipher list details on
this URL: http://www.openssl.org/docs/apps/ciphers.html</p>

<p>NSS ciphers are done differently than OpenSSL and
GnuTLS. The full list of NSS ciphers is in the
NSSCipherSuite entry at this URL:
http://directory.fedora.redhat.com/docs/mod_nss.html#Direc-
tives</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the last one will
override the others.</p>

<p>--compressed (HTTP) Request a compressed response using
one of the algorithms libcurl supports, and return the
uncompressed document. If this option is used and the server
sends an unsupported encoding, curl will report an
error.</p>

<p>--connect-timeout &lt;seconds&gt; Maximum time in
seconds that you allow the connection to the server to take.
This only limits the connection phase, once curl has
connected this option is of no more use. See also the
-m/--max-time option.</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the last one will
be used.</p>

<p>-c/--cookie-jar &lt;file name&gt; Specify to which file
you want curl to write all cookies after a completed
operation. Curl writes all cookies previously read from a
specified file as well as all cookies received from remote
server(s). If no cookies are known, no file will be writ-
ten. The file will be written using the Netscape cookie file
format. If you set the file name to a single dash,
&quot;-&quot;, the cookies will be written to stdout.</p>

<p>NOTE If the cookie jar cant be created or written to,
the whole curl operation won t fail or even report an error
clearly. Using -v will get a warning displayed, but that is
the only visible feedback you get about this possibly lethal
situation.</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the last specified
file name will be used.</p>

<p>-C/--continue-at &lt;offset&gt; Continue/Resume a
previous file transfer at the given offset. The given offset
is the exact number of bytes that will be skipped, counting
from the beginning of the source file before it is
transferred to the destination. If used with uploads, the
FTP server command SIZE will not be used by curl.</p>

<p>Use &quot;-C -&quot; to tell curl to automatically find
out where/how to resume the transfer. It then uses the given
output/input files to figure that out.</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the last one will
be used.</p>

<p>--create-dirs When used in conjunction with the -o
option, curl will create the necessary local directory
hierarchy as needed. This option creates the dirs mentioned
with the -o option, nothing else. If the -o file name uses
no dir or if the dirs it mentions already exist, no dir will
be created.</p>

<p>To create remote directories when using FTP or SFTP, try
--ftp- create-dirs.</p>

<p>--crlf (FTP) Convert LF to CRLF in upload. Useful for
MVS (OS/390).</p>

<p>--crlfile &lt;file&gt; (HTTPS/FTPS) Provide a file using
PEM format with a Certificate Revocation List that may
specify peer certificates that are to be considered
revoked.</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the last one will
be used.</p>

<p>(Added in 7.19.7)</p>

<p>-d/--data &lt;data&gt; (HTTP) Sends the specified data
in a POST request to the HTTP server, in the same way that a
browser does when a user has filled in an HTML form and
presses the submit button. This will cause curl to pass the
data to the server using the content-type
application/x-www-form-urlencoded. Compare to -F/--form.</p>

<p>-d/--data is the same as --data-ascii. To post data
purely binary, you should instead use the --data-binary
option. To URL- encode the value of a form field you may use
--data-urlencode.</p>

<p>If any of these options is used more than once on the
same com- mand line, the data pieces specified will be
merged together with a separating &amp;-symbol. Thus, using
-d name=daniel -d skill=lousy would generate a post chunk
that looks like name=daniel&amp;skill=lousy.</p>

<p>If you start the data with the letter @, the rest should
be a file name to read the data from, or - if you want curl
to read the data from stdin. The contents of the file must
already be URL-encoded. Multiple files can also be
specified. Posting data from a file named foobar would thus
be done with --data @foobar.</p>

<p>--data-binary &lt;data&gt; (HTTP) This posts data
exactly as specified with no extra pro- cessing
whatsoever.</p>

<p>If you start the data with the letter @, the rest should
be a filename. Data is posted in a similar manner as
--data-ascii does, except that newlines are preserved and
conversions are never done.</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the ones following
the first will append data as described in -d/--data.</p>

<p>--data-urlencode &lt;data&gt; (HTTP) This posts data,
similar to the other --data options with the exception that
this performs URL-encoding. (Added in 7.18.0)</p>

<p>To be CGI-compliant, the &lt;data&gt; part should begin
with a name followed by a separator and a content
specification. The &lt;data&gt; part can be passed to curl
using one of the following syntaxes:</p>

<p>content This will make curl URL-encode the content and
pass that on. Just be careful so that the content doesnt
contain any = or @ symbols, as that will then make the
syntax match one of the other cases below!</p>

<p>=content This will make curl URL-encode the content and
pass that on. The preceding = symbol is not included in the
data.</p>

<p>name=content This will make curl URL-encode the content
part and pass that on. Note that the name part is expected
to be URL- encoded already.</p>

<p>@filename This will make curl load data from the given
file (including any newlines), URL-encode that data and pass
it on in the POST.</p>

<p>name@filename This will make curl load data from the
given file (including any newlines), URL-encode that data
and pass it on in the POST. The name part gets an equal sign
appended, resulting in name=urlencoded-file-content. Note
that the name is expected to be URL-encoded already.</p>

<p>--digest (HTTP) Enables HTTP Digest authentication. This
is a authentica- tion that prevents the password from being
sent over the wire in clear text. Use this in combination
with the normal -u/--user option to set user name and
password. See also --ntlm, --negoti- ate and --anyauth for
related options.</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the following
occurrences make no difference.</p>

<p>--disable-eprt (FTP) Tell curl to disable the use of the
EPRT and LPRT commands when doing active FTP transfers. Curl
will normally always first attempt to use EPRT, then LPRT
before using PORT, but with this option, it will use PORT
right away. EPRT and LPRT are exten- sions to the original
FTP protocol, and may not work on all servers, but they
enable more functionality in a better way than the
traditional PORT command.</p>

<p>Since curl 7.19.0, --eprt can be used to explicitly
enable EPRT again and --no-eprt is an alias for
--disable-eprt.</p>

<p>Disabling EPRT only changes the active behavior. If you
want to switch to passive mode you need to not use
-P/--ftp-port or force it with --ftp-pasv.</p>

<p>--disable-epsv (FTP) Tell curl to disable the use of the
EPSV command when doing passive FTP transfers. Curl will
normally always first attempt to use EPSV before PASV, but
with this option, it will not try using EPSV.</p>

<p>Since curl 7.19.0, --epsv can be used to explicitly
enable EPRT again and --no-epsv is an alias for
--disable-epsv.</p>

<p>Disabling EPSV only changes the passive behavior. If you
want to switch to active mode you need to use
-P/--ftp-port.</p>

<p>-D/--dump-header &lt;file&gt; Write the protocol headers
to the specified file.</p>

<p>This option is handy to use when you want to store the
headers that a HTTP site sends to you. Cookies from the
headers could then be read in a second curl invocation by
using the -b/--cookie option! The -c/--cookie-jar option is
however a bet- ter way to store cookies.</p>

<p>When used in FTP, the FTP server response lines are
considered being &quot;headers&quot; and thus are saved
there.</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the last one will
be used.</p>

<p>-e/--referer &lt;URL&gt; (HTTP) Sends the &quot;Referer
Page&quot; information to the HTTP server. This can also be
set with the -H/--header flag of course. When used with
-L/--location you can append &quot;;auto&quot; to the
--referer URL to make curl automatically set the previous
URL when it fol- lows a Location: header. The
&quot;;auto&quot; string can be used alone, even if you dont
set an initial --referer.</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the last one will
be used.</p>

<p>--engine &lt;name&gt; Select the OpenSSL crypto engine
to use for cipher operations. Use --engine list to print a
list of build-time supported engines. Note that not all (or
none) of the engines may be available at run-time.</p>

<p>--environment (RISC OS ONLY) Sets a range of environment
variables, using the names the -w option supports, to allow
easier extraction of use- ful information after having run
curl.</p>

<p>--egd-file &lt;file&gt; (SSL) Specify the path name to
the Entropy Gathering Daemon socket. The socket is used to
seed the random engine for SSL connections. See also the
--random-file option.</p>

<p>-E/--cert &lt;certificate[:password]&gt; (SSL) Tells
curl to use the specified certificate file when get- ting a
file with HTTPS or FTPS. The certificate must be in PEM
format. If the optional password isnt specified, it will be
queried for on the terminal. Note that this option assumes a
&quot;certificate&quot; file that is the private key and the
private cer- tificate concatenated! See --cert and --key to
specify them independently.</p>

<p>If curl is built against the NSS SSL library then this
option tells curl the nickname of the certificate to use
within the NSS database defined by the environment variable
SSL_DIR (or by default /etc/pki/nssdb). If the NSS PEM
PKCS#11 module (lib- nsspem.so) is available then PEM files
may be loaded.</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the last one will
be used.</p>

<p>--cert-type &lt;type&gt; (SSL) Tells curl what
certificate type the provided certificate is in. PEM, DER
and ENG are recognized types. If not specified, PEM is
assumed.</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the last one will
be used.</p>

<p>--cacert &lt;CA certificate&gt; (SSL) Tells curl to use
the specified certificate file to verify the peer. The file
may contain multiple CA certificates. The certificate(s)
must be in PEM format. Normally curl is built to use a
default file for this, so this option is typically used to
alter that default file.</p>

<p>curl recognizes the environment variable named
CURL_CA_BUNDLE if it is set, and uses the given path as a
path to a CA cert bundle. This option overrides that
variable.</p>

<p>The windows version of curl will automatically look for
a CA certs file named &acute;curl-ca-bundle.crt&acute;,
either in the same direc- tory as curl.exe, or in the
Current Working Directory, or in any folder along your
PATH.</p>

<p>If curl is built against the NSS SSL library then this
option tells curl the nickname of the CA certificate to use
within the NSS database defined by the environment variable
SSL_DIR (or by default /etc/pki/nssdb). If the NSS PEM
PKCS#11 module (lib- nsspem.so) is available then PEM files
may be loaded.</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the last one will
be used.</p>

<p>--capath &lt;CA certificate directory&gt; (SSL) Tells
curl to use the specified certificate directory to verify
the peer. The certificates must be in PEM format, and the
directory must have been processed using the c_rehash
utility supplied with openssl. Using --capath can allow curl
to make SSL-connections much more efficiently than using
--cacert if the --cacert file contains many CA
certificates.</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the last one will
be used.</p>

<p>-f/--fail (HTTP) Fail silently (no output at all) on
server errors. This is mostly done to better enable scripts
etc to better deal with failed attempts. In normal cases
when a HTTP server fails to deliver a document, it returns
an HTML document stating so (which often also describes why
and more). This flag will pre- vent curl from outputting
that and return error 22.</p>

<p>This method is not fail-safe and there are occasions
where non- successful response codes will slip through,
especially when authentication is involved (response codes
401 and 407).</p>

<p>--ftp-account [data] (FTP) When an FTP server asks for
&quot;account data&quot; after user name and password has
been provided, this data is sent off using the ACCT command.
(Added in 7.13.0)</p>

<p>If this option is used twice, the second will override
the pre- vious use.</p>

<p>--ftp-create-dirs (FTP/SFTP) When an FTP or SFTP
URL/operation uses a path that doesnt currently exist on the
server, the standard behavior of curl is to fail. Using this
option, curl will instead attempt to create missing
directories.</p>

<p>--ftp-method [method] (FTP) Control what method curl
should use to reach a file on a FTP(S) server. The method
argument should be one of the follow- ing alternatives:</p>

<p>multicwd curl does a single CWD operation for each path
part in the given URL. For deep hierarchies this means very
many commands. This is how RFC1738 says it should be done.
This is the default but the slowest behavior.</p>

<p>nocwd curl does no CWD at all. curl will do SIZE, RETR,
STOR etc and give a full path to the server for all these
com- mands. This is the fastest behavior.</p>

<p>singlecwd curl does one CWD with the full target
directory and then operates on the file &quot;normally&quot;
(like in the multicwd case). This is somewhat more standards
compliant than nocwd but without the full penalty of
multicwd. (Added in 7.15.1)</p>

<p>--ftp-pasv (FTP) Use passive mode for the data
conection. Passive is the internal default behavior, but
using this option can be used to override a previous
-P/-ftp-port option. (Added in 7.11.0)</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the following
occurrences make no difference. Undoing an enforced passive
really isnt doable but you must then instead enforce the
correct -P/--ftp- port again.</p>

<p>Passive mode means that curl will try the EPSV command
first and then PASV, unless --disable-epsv is used.</p>

<p>--ftp-alternative-to-user &lt;command&gt; (FTP) If
authenticating with the USER and PASS commands fails, send
this command. When connecting to Tumbleweeds Secure
Transport server over FTPS using a client certificate, using
&quot;SITE AUTH&quot; will tell the server to retrieve the
username from the certificate. (Added in 7.15.5)</p>

<p>--ftp-skip-pasv-ip (FTP) Tell curl to not use the IP
address the server suggests in its response to curl s PASV
command when curl connects the data connection. Instead curl
will re-use the same IP address it already uses for the
control connection. (Added in 7.14.2)</p>

<p>This option has no effect if PORT, EPRT or EPSV is used
instead of PASV.</p>

<p>--ftp-ssl (FTP) Try to use SSL/TLS for the FTP
connection. Reverts to a non-secure connection if the server
doesn t support SSL/TLS. See also --ftp-ssl-control and
--ftp-ssl-reqd for different lev- els of encryption
required. (Added in 7.11.0)</p>

<p>--ftp-ssl-control (FTP) Require SSL/TLS for the FTP
login, clear for transfer. Allows secure authentication, but
non-encrypted data transfers for efficiency. Fails the
transfer if the server doesnt sup- port SSL/TLS. (Added in
7.16.0)</p>

<p>--ftp-ssl-reqd (FTP) Require SSL/TLS for the FTP
connection. Terminates the connection if the server doesnt
support SSL/TLS. (Added in 7.15.5)</p>

<p>--ftp-ssl-ccc (FTP) Use CCC (Clear Command Channel)
Shuts down the SSL/TLS layer after authenticating. The rest
of the control channel com- munication will be unencrypted.
This allows NAT routers to fol- low the FTP transaction. The
default mode is passive. See --ftp- ssl-ccc-mode for other
modes. (Added in 7.16.1)</p>

<p>--ftp-ssl-ccc-mode [active/passive] (FTP) Use CCC (Clear
Command Channel) Sets the CCC mode. The passive mode will
not initiate the shutdown, but instead wait for the server
to do it, and will not reply to the shutdown from the
server. The active mode initiates the shutdown and waits for
a reply from the server. (Added in 7.16.2)</p>

<p>-F/--form &lt;name=content&gt; (HTTP) This lets curl
emulate a filled-in form in which a user has pressed the
submit button. This causes curl to POST data using the
Content-Type multipart/form-data according to RFC2388. This
enables uploading of binary files etc. To force the con-
tent part to be a file, prefix the file name with an @ sign.
To just get the content part from a file, prefix the file
name with the symbol &lt;. The difference between @ and &lt;
is then that @ makes a file get attached in the post as a
file upload, while the &lt; makes a text field and just get
the contents for that text field from a file.</p>

<p>Example, to send your password file to the server, where
pass- word is the name of the form-field to which
/etc/passwd will be the input:</p>

<p>curl -F password=@/etc/passwd www.mypasswords.com</p>

<p>To read the files content from stdin instead of a file,
use - where the file name shouldve been. This goes for both
@ and &lt; constructs.</p>

<p>You can also tell curl what Content-Type to use by using
type=, in a manner similar to:</p>

<p>curl -F &quot;web=@index.html;type=text/html&quot;
url.com</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>curl -F &quot;name=daniel;type=text/foo&quot;
url.com</p>

<p>You can also explicitly change the name field of an file
upload part by setting filename=, like this:</p>

<p>curl -F &quot;file=@localfile;filename=nameinpost&quot;
url.com</p>

<p>See further examples and details in the MANUAL.</p>

<p>This option can be used multiple times.</p>

<p>--form-string &lt;name=string&gt; (HTTP) Similar to
--form except that the value string for the named parameter
is used literally. Leading @ and &lt; characters, and the
;type= string in the value have no special meaning. Use this
in preference to --form if there s any possi- bility that
the string value may accidentally trigger the @ or &lt;
features of --form.</p>

<p>-g/--globoff This option switches off the &quot;URL
globbing parser&quot;. When you set this option, you can
specify URLs that contain the letters {}[] without having
them being interpreted by curl itself. Note that these
letters are not normal legal URL contents but they should be
encoded according to the URI standard.</p>

<p>-G/--get When used, this option will make all data
specified with -d/--data or --data-binary to be used in a
HTTP GET request instead of the POST request that otherwise
would be used. The data will be appended to the URL with a ?
separator.</p>

<p>If used in combination with -I, the POST data will
instead be appended to the URL with a HEAD request.</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the following
occurrences make no difference. This is because undoing a
GET doesnt make sense, but you should then instead enforce
the alternative method you prefer.</p>

<p>-h/--help Usage help.</p>

<p>-H/--header &lt;header&gt; (HTTP) Extra header to use
when getting a web page. You may specify any number of extra
headers. Note that if you should add a custom header that
has the same name as one of the internal ones curl would
use, your externally set header will be used instead of the
internal one. This allows you to make even trick- ier stuff
than curl would normally do. You should not replace
internally set headers without knowing perfectly well what
youre doing. Remove an internal header by giving a
replacement without content on the right side of the colon,
as in: -H &quot;Host:&quot;.</p>

<p>curl will make sure that each header you add/replace is
sent with the proper end-of-line marker, you should thus not
add that as a part of the header content: do not add
newlines or carriage returns, they will only mess things up
for you.</p>

<p>See also the -A/--user-agent and -e/--referer
options.</p>

<p>This option can be used multiple times to
add/replace/remove multiple headers.</p>

<p>--hostpubmd5 &lt;md5&gt; Pass a string containing 32
hexadecimal digits. The string should be the 128 bit MD5
checksum of the remote hosts public key, curl will refuse
the connection with the host unless the md5sums match. This
option is only for SCP and SFTP transfers. (Added in
7.17.1)</p>

<p>--ignore-content-length (HTTP) Ignore the Content-Length
header. This is particularly useful for servers running
Apache 1.x, which will report incor- rect Content-Length for
files larger than 2 gigabytes.</p>

<p>-i/--include (HTTP) Include the HTTP-header in the
output. The HTTP-header includes things like server-name,
date of the document, HTTP- version and more...</p>

<p>--interface &lt;name&gt; Perform an operation using a
specified interface. You can enter interface name, IP
address or host name. An example could look like:</p>

<p>curl --interface eth0:1 http://www.netscape.com/</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the last one will
be used.</p>

<p>-I/--head (HTTP/FTP/FILE) Fetch the HTTP-header only!
HTTP-servers feature the command HEAD which this uses to get
nothing but the header of a document. When used on a FTP or
FILE file, curl displays the file size and last modification
time only.</p>

<p>-j/--junk-session-cookies (HTTP) When curl is told to
read cookies from a given file, this option will make it
discard all &quot;session cookies&quot;. This will basically
have the same effect as if a new session is started. Typical
browsers always discard session cookies when theyre closed
down.</p>

<p>-k/--insecure (SSL) This option explicitly allows curl
to perform &quot;insecure&quot; SSL connections and
transfers. All SSL connections are attempted to be made
secure by using the CA certificate bundle installed by
default. This makes all connections considered
&quot;insecure&quot; fail unless -k/--insecure is used.</p>

<p>See this online resource for further details:
http://curl.haxx.se/docs/sslcerts.html</p>

<p>--keepalive-time &lt;seconds&gt; This option sets the
time a connection needs to remain idle before sending
keepalive probes and the time between individual keepalive
probes. It is currently effective on operating systems
offering the TCP_KEEPIDLE and TCP_KEEPINTVL socket options
(meaning Linux, recent AIX, HP-UX and more). This option has
no effect if --no-keepalive is used. (Added in 7.18.0)</p>

<p>If this option is used multiple times, the last
occurrence sets the amount.</p>

<p>--key &lt;key&gt; (SSL/SSH) Private key file name.
Allows you to provide your pri- vate key in this separate
file.</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the last one will
be used.</p>

<p>--key-type &lt;type&gt; (SSL) Private key file type.
Specify which type your --key pro- vided private key is.
DER, PEM, and ENG are supported. If not specified, PEM is
assumed.</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the last one will
be used.</p>

<p>--krb &lt;level&gt; (FTP) Enable Kerberos authentication
and use. The level must be entered and should be one of
clear , safe , confidential, or private . Should you use a
level that is not one of these, private will instead be
used.</p>

<p>This option requires a library built with kerberos4 or
GSSAPI (GSS-Negotiate) support. This is not very common. Use
-V/--ver- sion to see if your curl supports it.</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the last one will
be used.</p>

<p>-K/--config &lt;config file&gt; Specify which config
file to read curl arguments from. The con- fig file is a
text file in which command line arguments can be written
which then will be used as if they were written on the
actual command line. Options and their parameters must be
speci- fied on the same config file line, separated by
whitespace, colon, the equals sign or any combination
thereof (however, the preferred separator is the equals
sign). If the parameter is to contain whitespace, the
parameter must be enclosed within quotes. Within double
quotes, the following escape sequences are available: \,
other letter is ignored. If the first column of a config
line is a # character, the rest of the line will be treated
as a com- ment. Only write one option per physical line in
the config file.</p>

<p>Specify the filename to -K/--config as - to make curl
read the file from stdin.</p>

<p>Note that to be able to specify a URL in the config
file, you need to specify it using the --url option, and not
by simply writing the URL on its own line. So, it could look
similar to this:</p>

<p>url = &quot;http://curl.haxx.se/docs/&quot;</p>

<p>Long option names can optionally be given in the config
file without the initial double dashes.</p>

<p>When curl is invoked, it always (unless -q is used)
checks for a default config file and uses it if found. The
default config file is checked for in the following places
in this order:</p>

<p>1) curl tries to find the &quot;home dir&quot;: It first
checks for the CURL_HOME and then the HOME environment
variables. Failing that, it uses getpwuid() on UNIX-like
systems (which returns the home dir given the current user
in your system). On Windows, it then checks for the APPDATA
variable, or as a last resort the %USER- PROFILE%0lication
Data.</p>

<p>2) On windows, if there is no _curlrc file in the home
dir, it checks for one in the same dir the curl executable
is placed. On UNIX-like systems, it will simply try to load
.curlrc from the determined home dir.</p>

<p># --- Example file --- # this is a comment url =
&quot;curl.haxx.se&quot; output = &quot;curlhere.html&quot;
user-agent = &quot;superagent/1.0&quot;</p>

<p># and fetch another URL too url =
&quot;curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html&quot; -O referer =
&quot;http://nowhereatall.com/&quot; # --- End of example
file ---</p>

<p>This option can be used multiple times to load multiple
config files.</p>

<p>--libcurl &lt;file&gt; Append this option to any
ordinary curl command line, and you will get a libcurl-using
source code written to the file that does the equivalent of
what your command-line operation does!</p>

<p>NOTE: this does not properly support -F and the sending
of mul- tipart formposts, so in those cases the output
program will be missing necessary calls to curl_formadd(3),
and possibly more.</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the last given
file name will be used. (Added in 7.16.1)</p>

<p>--limit-rate &lt;speed&gt; Specify the maximum transfer
rate you want curl to use. This feature is useful if you
have a limited pipe and youd like your transfer not to use
your entire bandwidth.</p>

<p>The given speed is measured in bytes/second, unless a
suffix is appended. Appending k or K will count the number
as kilo- bytes, m or M makes it megabytes, while g or G
makes it gigabytes. Examples: 200K, 3m and 1G.</p>

<p>The given rate is the average speed counted during the
entire transfer. It means that curl might use higher
transfer speeds in short bursts, but over time it uses no
more than the given rate.</p>

<p>If you also use the -Y/--speed-limit option, that option
will take precedence and might cripple the rate-limiting
slightly, to help keeping the speed-limit logic working.</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the last one will
be used.</p>

<p>-l/--list-only (FTP) When listing an FTP directory, this
switch forces a name- only view. Especially useful if you
want to machine-parse the contents of an FTP directory since
the normal directory view doesnt use a standard look or
format.</p>

<p>This option causes an FTP NLST command to be sent. Some
FTP servers list only files in their response to NLST; they
do not include subdirectories and symbolic links.</p>

<p>--local-port &lt;num&gt;[-num] Set a preferred number or
range of local port numbers to use for the connection(s).
Note that port numbers by nature are a scarce resource that
will be busy at times so setting this range to something too
narrow might cause unnecessary connection setup failures.
(Added in 7.15.2)</p>

<p>-L/--location (HTTP/HTTPS) If the server reports that
the requested page has moved to a different location
(indicated with a Location: header and a 3XX response code),
this option will make curl redo the request on the new
place. If used together with -i/--include or -I/--head,
headers from all requested pages will be shown. When
authentication is used, curl only sends its credentials to
the initial host. If a redirect takes curl to a different
host, it wont be able to intercept the user+password. See
also --loca- tion-trusted on how to change this. You can
limit the amount of redirects to follow by using the
--max-redirs option.</p>

<p>When curl follows a redirect and the request is not a
plain GET (for example POST or PUT), it will do the
following request with a GET if the HTTP response was 301,
302, or 303. If the response code was any other 3xx code,
curl will re-send the following request using the same
unmodified method.</p>

<p>--location-trusted (HTTP/HTTPS) Like -L/--location, but
will allow sending the name + password to all hosts that the
site may redirect to. This may or may not introduce a
security breach if the site redirects you to a site to which
youll send your authentication info (which is plaintext in
the case of HTTP Basic authentication).</p>

<p>--max-filesize &lt;bytes&gt; Specify the maximum size
(in bytes) of a file to download. If the file requested is
larger than this value, the transfer will not start and curl
will return with exit code 63.</p>

<p>NOTE: The file size is not always known prior to
download, and for such files this option has no effect even
if the file trans- fer ends up being larger than this given
limit. This concerns both FTP and HTTP transfers.</p>

<p>-m/--max-time &lt;seconds&gt; Maximum time in seconds
that you allow the whole operation to take. This is useful
for preventing your batch jobs from hang- ing for hours due
to slow networks or links going down. See also the
--connect-timeout option.</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the last one will
be used.</p>

<p>-M/--manual Manual. Display the huge help text.</p>

<p>-n/--netrc Makes curl scan the .netrc (_netrc on
Windows) file in the users home directory for login name and
password. This is typi- cally used for FTP on UNIX. If used
with HTTP, curl will enable user authentication. See
netrc(4) or ftp(1) for details on the file format. Curl will
not complain if that file doesnt have the right permissions
(it should not be either world- or group- readable). The
environment variable &quot;HOME&quot; is used to find the
home directory.</p>

<p>A quick and very simple example of how to setup a .netrc
to allow curl to FTP to the machine host.domain.com with
user name myself and password secret should look similar
to:</p>

<p>machine host.domain.com login myself password secret</p>

<p>--netrc-optional Very similar to --netrc, but this
option makes the .netrc usage optional and not mandatory as
the --netrc option does.</p>

<p>--negotiate (HTTP) Enables GSS-Negotiate authentication.
The GSS-Negotiate method was designed by Microsoft and is
used in their web appli- cations. It is primarily meant as a
support for Kerberos5 authentication but may be also used
along with another authenti- cation method. For more
information see IETF draft draft-brezak-
spnego-http-04.txt.</p>

<p>If you want to enable Negotiate for your proxy
authentication, then use --proxy-negotiate.</p>

<p>This option requires a library built with GSSAPI
support. This is not very common. Use -V/--version to see if
your version sup- ports GSS-Negotiate.</p>

<p>When using this option, you must also provide a fake
-u/--user option to activate the authentication code
properly. Sending a -u : is enough as the user name and
password from the -u option arent actually used.</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the following
occurrences make no difference.</p>

<p>-N/--no-buffer Disables the buffering of the output
stream. In normal work sit- uations, curl will use a
standard buffered output stream that will have the effect
that it will output the data in chunks, not necessarily
exactly when the data arrives. Using this option will
disable that buffering.</p>

<p>Note that this is the negated option name documented.
You can thus use --buffer to enforce the buffering.</p>

<p>--no-keepalive Disables the use of keepalive messages on
the TCP connection, as by default curl enables them.</p>

<p>Note that this is the negated option name documented.
You can thus use --keepalive to enforce keepalive.</p>

<p>--no-sessionid (SSL) Disable curls use of SSL session-ID
caching. By default all transfers are done using the cache.
Note that while nothing should ever get hurt by attempting
to reuse SSL session-IDs, there seem to be broken SSL
implementations in the wild that may require you to disable
this in order for you to succeed. (Added in 7.16.0)</p>

<p>Note that this is the negated option name documented.
You can thus use --sessionid to enforce session-ID
caching.</p>

<p>--noproxy &lt;no-proxy-list&gt; Comma-separated list of
hosts which do not use a proxy, if one is specified. The
only wildcard is a single * character, which matches all
hosts, and effectively disables the proxy. Each name in this
list is matched as either a domain which contains the
hostname, or the hostname itself. For example, local.com
would match local.com, local.com:80, and www.local.com, but
not www.notlocal.com. (Added in 7.19.4).</p>

<p>--ntlm (HTTP) Enables NTLM authentication. The NTLM
authentication method was designed by Microsoft and is used
by IIS web servers. It is a proprietary protocol,
reverse-engineered by clever peo- ple and implemented in
curl based on their efforts. This kind of behavior should
not be endorsed, you should encourage everyone who uses NTLM
to switch to a public and documented authentica- tion method
instead, such as Digest.</p>

<p>If you want to enable NTLM for your proxy
authentication, then use --proxy-ntlm.</p>

<p>This option requires a library built with SSL support.
Use -V/--version to see if your curl supports NTLM.</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the following
occurrences make no difference.</p>

<p>-o/--output &lt;file&gt; Write output to &lt;file&gt;
instead of stdout. If you are using {} or [] to fetch
multiple documents, you can use # followed by a number in
the &lt;file&gt; specifier. That variable will be replaced
with the current string for the URL being fetched. Like
in:</p>

<p>curl http://{one,two}.site.com -o
&quot;file_#1.txt&quot;</p>

<p>or use several variables like:</p>

<p>curl http://{site,host}.host[1-5].com -o
&quot;#1_#2&quot;</p>

<p>You may use this option as many times as the number of
URLs you have.</p>

<p>See also the --create-dirs option to create the local
directo- ries dynamically. Specifying the output as - (a
single dash) will force the output to be done to stdout.</p>

<p>-O/--remote-name Write output to a local file named like
the remote file we get. (Only the file part of the remote
file is used, the path is cut off.)</p>

<p>The remote file name to use for saving is extracted from
the given URL, nothing else.</p>

<p>You may use this option as many times as the number of
URLs you have.</p>

<p>--remote-name-all This option changes the default action
for all given URLs to be dealt with as if -O/--remote-name
were used for each one. So if you want to disable that for a
specific URL after --remote-name- all has been used, you
must use &quot;-o -&quot; or --no-remote-name. (Added in
7.19.0)</p>

<p>--pass &lt;phrase&gt; (SSL/SSH) Passphrase for the
private key</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the last one will
be used.</p>

<p>--post301 Tells curl to respect RFC 2616/10.3.2 and not
convert POST requests into GET requests when following a 301
redirection. The non-RFC behaviour is ubiquitous in web
browsers, so curl does the conversion by default to maintain
consistency. However, a server may require a POST to remain
a POST after such a redirec- tion. This option is meaningful
only when using -L/--location (Added in 7.17.1)</p>

<p>--post302 Tells curl to respect RFC 2616/10.3.2 and not
convert POST requests into GET requests when following a 302
redirection. The non-RFC behaviour is ubiquitous in web
browsers, so curl does the conversion by default to maintain
consistency. However, a server may require a POST to remain
a POST after such a redirec- tion. This option is meaningful
only when using -L/--location (Added in 7.19.1)</p>

<p>--proxy-anyauth Tells curl to pick a suitable
authentication method when commu- nicating with the given
proxy. This might cause an extra request/response
round-trip. (Added in 7.13.2)</p>

<p>--proxy-basic Tells curl to use HTTP Basic
authentication when communicating with the given proxy. Use
--basic for enabling HTTP Basic with a remote host. Basic is
the default authentication method curl uses with
proxies.</p>

<p>--proxy-digest Tells curl to use HTTP Digest
authentication when communicating with the given proxy. Use
--digest for enabling HTTP Digest with a remote host.</p>

<p>--proxy-negotiate Tells curl to use HTTP Negotiate
authentication when communicat- ing with the given proxy.
Use --negotiate for enabling HTTP Negotiate with a remote
host. (Added in 7.17.1)</p>

<p>--proxy-ntlm Tells curl to use HTTP NTLM authentication
when communicating with the given proxy. Use --ntlm for
enabling NTLM with a remote host.</p>

<p>--proxy1.0 &lt;proxyhost[:port]&gt; Use the specified
HTTP 1.0 proxy. If the port number is not specified, it is
assumed at port 1080.</p>

<p>The only difference between this and the HTTP proxy
option (-x/--proxy), is that attempts to use CONNECT through
the proxy will specify an HTTP 1.0 protocol instead of the
default HTTP 1.1.</p>

<p>-p/--proxytunnel When an HTTP proxy is used
(-x/--proxy), this option will cause non-HTTP protocols to
attempt to tunnel through the proxy instead of merely using
it to do HTTP-like operations. The tun- nel approach is made
with the HTTP proxy CONNECT request and requires that the
proxy allows direct connect to the remote port number curl
wants to tunnel through to.</p>

<p>--pubkey &lt;key&gt; (SSH) Public key file name. Allows
you to provide your public key in this separate file.</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the last one will
be used.</p>

<p>-P/--ftp-port &lt;address&gt; (FTP) Reverses the default
initiator/listener roles when con- necting with FTP. This
switch makes curl use active mode. In practice, curl then
tells the server to connect back to the client s specified
address and port, while passive mode asks the server to
setup an IP address and port for it to connect to.
&lt;address&gt; should be one of:</p>

<p>interface i.e &quot;eth0&quot; to specify which
interfaces IP address you want to use (Unix only)</p>

<p>IP address i.e &quot;192.168.10.1&quot; to specify the
exact IP address</p>

<p>host name i.e &quot;my.host.domain&quot; to specify the
machine</p>

<p>- make curl pick the same IP address that is already
used for the control connection</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the last one will
be used. Dis- able the use of PORT with --ftp-pasv. Disable
the attempt to use the EPRT command instead of PORT by using
--disable-eprt. EPRT is really PORT++.</p>

<p>Starting in 7.19.5, you can append
&quot;:[start]-[end]&quot; to the right of the address, to
tell curl what TCP port range to use. That means you spec-
ify a port range, from a lower to a higher number. A single
number works as well, but do note that it increases the risk
of failure since the port may not be available.</p>

<p>-q If used as the first parameter on the command line,
the curlrc config file will not be read and used. See the
-K/--config for details on the default config file search
path.</p>

<p>-Q/--quote &lt;command&gt; (FTP/SFTP) Send an arbitrary
command to the remote FTP or SFTP server. Quote commands are
sent BEFORE the transfer takes place (just after the initial
PWD command in an FTP transfer, to be exact). To make
commands take place after a successful transfer, prefix them
with a dash -. To make commands be sent after libcurl has
changed the working directory, just before the transfer
command(s), prefix the command with a + (this is only
supported for FTP). You may specify any number of commands.
If the server returns failure for one of the commands, the
entire operation will be aborted. You must send
syntactically correct FTP commands as RFC959 defines to FTP
servers, or one of the commands listed below to SFTP
servers. This option can be used multiple times.</p>

<p>SFTP is a binary protocol. Unlike for FTP, libcurl
interprets SFTP quote commands before sending them to the
server. Follow- ing is the list of all supported SFTP quote
commands:</p>

<p>chgrp group file The chgrp command sets the group ID of
the file named by the file operand to the group ID specified
by the group operand. The group operand is a decimal integer
group ID.</p>

<p>chmod mode file The chmod command modifies the file mode
bits of the specified file. The mode operand is an octal
integer mode number.</p>

<p>chown user file The chown command sets the owner of the
file named by the file operand to the user ID specified by
the user operand. The user operand is a decimal integer user
ID.</p>

<p>ln source_file target_file The ln and symlink commands
create a symbolic link at the target_file location pointing
to the source_file loca- tion.</p>

<p>mkdir directory_name The mkdir command creates the
directory named by the directory_name operand.</p>

<p>pwd The pwd command returns the absolute pathname of the
cur- rent working directory.</p>

<p>rename source target The rename command renames the file
or directory named by the source operand to the destination
path named by the target operand.</p>

<p>rm file The rm command removes the file specified by the
file operand.</p>

<p>rmdir directory The rmdir command removes the directory
entry specified by the directory operand, provided it is
empty.</p>

<p>symlink source_file target_file See ln.</p>

<p>--random-file &lt;file&gt; (SSL) Specify the path name
to file containing what will be con- sidered as random data.
The data is used to seed the random engine for SSL
connections. See also the --egd-file option.</p>

<p>-r/--range &lt;range&gt; (HTTP/FTP/SFTP/FILE) Retrieve a
byte range (i.e a partial docu- ment) from a HTTP/1.1, FTP
or SFTP server or a local FILE. Ranges can be specified in a
number of ways.</p>

<p>0-499 specifies the first 500 bytes</p>

<p>500-999 specifies the second 500 bytes</p>

<p>-500 specifies the last 500 bytes</p>

<p>9500- specifies the bytes from offset 9500 and
forward</p>

<p>0-0,-1 specifies the first and last byte only(*)(H)</p>

<p>500-700,600-799 specifies 300 bytes from offset
500(H)</p>

<p>100-199,500-599 specifies two separate 100-byte
ranges(*)(H)</p>

<p>(*) = NOTE that this will cause the server to reply with
a multipart response!</p>

<p>Only digit characters (0-9) are valid in the start and
stop fields of the start-stop range syntax. If a non-digit
character is given in the range, the server s response will
be unspecified, depending on the servers configuration.</p>

<p>You should also be aware that many HTTP/1.1 servers do
not have this feature enabled, so that when you attempt to
get a range, youll instead get the whole document.</p>

<p>FTP and SFTP range downloads only support the simple
start-stop syn- tax (optionally with one of the numbers
omitted). FTP use depends on the extended FTP command
SIZE.</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the last one will
be used.</p>

<p>--raw When used, it disables all internal HTTP decoding
of content or transfer encodings and instead makes them
passed on unaltered, raw. (Added in 7.16.2)</p>

<p>-R/--remote-time When used, this will make libcurl
attempt to figure out the timestamp of the remote file, and
if that is available make the local file get that same
timestamp.</p>

<p>--retry &lt;num&gt; If a transient error is returned
when curl tries to perform a transfer, it will retry this
number of times before giving up. Setting the number to 0
makes curl do no retries (which is the default). Transient
error means either: a timeout, an FTP 5xx response code or
an HTTP 5xx response code.</p>

<p>When curl is about to retry a transfer, it will first
wait one second and then for all forthcoming retries it will
double the waiting time until it reaches 10 minutes which
then will be the delay between the rest of the retries. By
using --retry-delay you disable this exponential backoff
algorithm. See also --retry-max-time to limit the total time
allowed for retries. (Added in 7.12.3)</p>

<p>If this option is used multiple times, the last
occurrence decide the amount.</p>

<p>--retry-delay &lt;seconds&gt; Make curl sleep this
amount of time before each retry when a transfer has failed
with a transient error (it changes the default backoff time
algorithm between retries). This option is only interesting
if --retry is also used. Setting this delay to zero will
make curl use the default backoff time. (Added in
7.12.3)</p>

<p>If this option is used multiple times, the last
occurrence determines the amount.</p>

<p>--retry-max-time &lt;seconds&gt; The retry timer is
reset before the first transfer attempt. Retries will be
done as usual (see --retry) as long as the timer hasn t
reached this given limit. Notice that if the timer hasnt
reached the limit, the request will be made and while
perform- ing, it may take longer than this given time
period. To limit a single request&acute;s maximum time, use
-m/--max-time. Set this option to zero to not timeout
retries. (Added in 7.12.3)</p>

<p>If this option is used multiple times, the last
occurrence determines the amount.</p>

<p>-s/--silent Silent or quiet mode. Dont show progress
meter or error mes- sages. Makes Curl mute.</p>

<p>-S/--show-error When used with -s it makes curl show an
error message if it fails.</p>

<p>--socks4 &lt;host[:port]&gt; Use the specified SOCKS4
proxy. If the port number is not speci- fied, it is assumed
at port 1080. (Added in 7.15.2)</p>

<p>This option overrides any previous use of -x/--proxy, as
they are mutually exclusive.</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the last one will
be used.</p>

<p>--socks4a &lt;host[:port]&gt; Use the specified SOCKS4a
proxy. If the port number is not spec- ified, it is assumed
at port 1080. (Added in 7.18.0)</p>

<p>This option overrides any previous use of -x/--proxy, as
they are mutually exclusive.</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the last one will
be used.</p>

<p>--socks5-hostname &lt;host[:port]&gt; Use the specified
SOCKS5 proxy (and let the proxy resolve the host name). If
the port number is not specified, it is assumed at port
1080. (Added in 7.18.0)</p>

<p>This option overrides any previous use of -x/--proxy, as
they are mutually exclusive.</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the last one will
be used. (This option was previously wrongly documented and
used as --socks without the number appended.)</p>

<p>--socks5 &lt;host[:port]&gt; Use the specified SOCKS5
proxy - but resolve the host name locally. If the port
number is not specified, it is assumed at port 1080.</p>

<p>This option overrides any previous use of -x/--proxy, as
they are mutually exclusive.</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the last one will
be used. (This option was previously wrongly documented and
used as --socks without the number appended.)</p>

<p>This option (as well as --socks4) does not work with
IPV6, FTPS or LDAP.</p>

<p>--socks5-gssapi-service &lt;servicename&gt; The default
service name for a socks server is rcmd/server-fqdn. This
option allows you to change it.</p>

<p>Examples: --socks5 proxy-name --socks5-gssapi-service
sockd would use sockd/proxy-name --socks5 proxy-name
--socks5-gssapi-service sockd/real-name would use
sockd/real-name for cases where the proxy-name does not
match the princpal name. (Added in 7.19.4).</p>

<p>--socks5-gssapi-nec As part of the gssapi negotiation a
protection mode is negoti- ated. The rfc1961 says in section
4.3/4.4 it should be pro- tected, but the NEC reference
implementation does not. The option --socks5-gssapi-nec
allows the unprotected exchange of the protection mode
negotiation. (Added in 7.19.4).</p>

<p>--stderr &lt;file&gt; Redirect all writes to stderr to
the specified file instead. If the file name is a plain -,
it is instead written to stdout. This option has no point
when youre using a shell with decent redirecting
capabilities.</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the last one will
be used.</p>

<p>--tcp-nodelay Turn on the TCP_NODELAY option. See the
curl_easy_setopt(3) man page for details about this option.
(Added in 7.11.2)</p>

<p>-t/--telnet-option &lt;OPT=val&gt; Pass options to the
telnet protocol. Supported options are:</p>

<p>TTYPE=&lt;term&gt; Sets the terminal type.</p>

<p>XDISPLOC=&lt;X display&gt; Sets the X display
location.</p>

<p>NEW_ENV=&lt;var,val&gt; Sets an environment
variable.</p>

<p>-T/--upload-file &lt;file&gt; This transfers the
specified local file to the remote URL. If there is no file
part in the specified URL, Curl will append the local file
name. NOTE that you must use a trailing / on the last
directory to really prove to Curl that there is no file name
or curl will think that your last directory name is the
remote file name to use. That will most likely cause the
upload operation to fail. If this is used on a HTTP(S)
server, the PUT command will be used.</p>

<p>Use the file name &quot;-&quot; (a single dash) to use
stdin instead of a given file. Alternately, the file name
&quot;.&quot; (a single period) may be specified instead of
&quot;-&quot; to use stdin in non-blocking mode to allow
reading server output while stdin is being uploaded.</p>

<p>You can specify one -T for each URL on the command line.
Each -T + URL pair specifies what to upload and to where.
curl also sup- ports &quot;globbing&quot; of the -T
argument, meaning that you can upload multiple files to a
single URL by using the same URL globbing style supported in
the URL, like this:</p>

<p>curl -T &quot;{file1,file2}&quot;
http://www.uploadtothissite.com</p>

<p>or even</p>

<p>curl -T &quot;img[1-1000].png&quot;
ftp://ftp.picturemania.com/upload/</p>

<p>--trace &lt;file&gt; Enables a full trace dump of all
incoming and outgoing data, including descriptive
information, to the given output file. Use &quot;-&quot; as
filename to have the output sent to stdout.</p>

<p>This option overrides previous uses of -v/--verbose or
--trace- ascii.</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the last one will
be used.</p>

<p>--trace-ascii &lt;file&gt; Enables a full trace dump of
all incoming and outgoing data, including descriptive
information, to the given output file. Use &quot;-&quot; as
filename to have the output sent to stdout.</p>

<p>This is very similar to --trace, but leaves out the hex
part and only shows the ASCII part of the dump. It makes
smaller output that might be easier to read for untrained
humans.</p>

<p>This option overrides previous uses of -v/--verbose or
--trace.</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the last one will
be used.</p>

<p>--trace-time Prepends a time stamp to each trace or
verbose line that curl displays. (Added in 7.14.0)</p>

<p>-u/--user &lt;user:password&gt; Specify the user name
and password to use for server authentica- tion. Overrides
-n/--netrc and --netrc-optional.</p>

<p>If you just give the user name (without entering a
colon) curl will prompt for a password.</p>

<p>If you use an SSPI-enabled curl binary and do NTLM
authentica- tion, you can force curl to pick up the user
name and password from your environment by simply specifying
a single colon with this option: &quot;-u :&quot;.</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the last one will
be used.</p>

<p>-U/--proxy-user &lt;user:password&gt; Specify the user
name and password to use for proxy authentica- tion.</p>

<p>If you use an SSPI-enabled curl binary and do NTLM
authentica- tion, you can force curl to pick up the user
name and password from your environment by simply specifying
a single colon with this option: &quot;-U :&quot;.</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the last one will
be used.</p>

<p>--url &lt;URL&gt; Specify a URL to fetch. This option is
mostly handy when you want to specify URL(s) in a config
file.</p>

<p>This option may be used any number of times. To control
where this URL is written, use the -o/--output or the
-O/--remote-name options.</p>

<p>-v/--verbose Makes the fetching more verbose/talkative.
Mostly useful for debugging. A line starting with &gt; means
&quot;header data&quot; sent by curl, &lt; means
&quot;header data&quot; received by curl that is hidden in
normal cases, and a line starting with * means additional
info provided by curl.</p>

<p>Note that if you only want HTTP headers in the output,
-i/--include might be the option youre looking for.</p>

<p>If you think this option still doesnt give you enough
details, consider using --trace or --trace-ascii
instead.</p>

<p>This option overrides previous uses of --trace-ascii or
--trace.</p>

<p>Use -S/--silent to make curl quiet.</p>

<p>-V/--version Displays information about curl and the
libcurl version it uses.</p>

<p>The first line includes the full version of curl,
libcurl and other 3rd party libraries linked with the
executable.</p>

<p>The second line (starts with &quot;Protocols:&quot;)
shows all protocols that libcurl reports to support.</p>

<p>The third line (starts with &quot;Features:&quot;) shows
specific features libcurl reports to offer. Available
features include:</p>

<p>IPv6 You can use IPv6 with this.</p>

<p>krb4 Krb4 for FTP is supported.</p>

<p>SSL HTTPS and FTPS are supported.</p>

<p>libz Automatic decompression of compressed files over
HTTP is supported.</p>

<p>NTLM NTLM authentication is supported.</p>

<p>GSS-Negotiate Negotiate authentication and krb5 for FTP
is supported.</p>

<p>Debug This curl uses a libcurl built with Debug. This
enables more error-tracking and memory debugging etc. For
curl- developers only!</p>

<p>AsynchDNS This curl uses asynchronous name resolves.</p>

<p>SPNEGO SPNEGO Negotiate authentication is supported.</p>

<p>Largefile This curl supports transfers of large files,
files larger than 2GB.</p>

<p>IDN This curl supports IDN - international domain
names.</p>

<p>SSPI SSPI is supported. If you use NTLM and set a blank
user name, curl will authenticate with your current user and
password.</p>

<p>-w/--write-out &lt;format&gt; Defines what to display on
stdout after a completed and success- ful operation. The
format is a string that may contain plain text mixed with
any number of variables. The string can be spec- ified as
&quot;string&quot;, to get read from a particular file you
spec- ify it &quot;@filename&quot; and to tell curl to read
the format from stdin you write &quot;@-&quot;.</p>

<p>The variables present in the output format will be
substituted by the value or text that curl thinks fit, as
described below. All variables are specified as
%{variable_name} and to output a normal % you just write
them as %%. You can output a newline by and a tab space
using 0 a carriage return with with .</p>

<p>NOTE: The %-symbol is a special symbol in the
win32-environment, where all occurrences of % must be
doubled when using this option.</p>

<p>The variables available at this point are:</p>

<p>url_effective The URL that was fetched last. This is
most mean- ingful if you ve told curl to follow location:
headers.</p>

<p>http_code The numerical response code that was found in
the last retrieved HTTP(S) or FTP(s) transfer. In 7.18.2 the
alias response_code was added to show the same info.</p>

<p>http_connect The numerical code that was found in the
last response (from a proxy) to a curl CONNECT request.
(Added in 7.12.4)</p>

<p>time_total The total time, in seconds, that the full
opera- tion lasted. The time will be displayed with mil-
lisecond resolution.</p>

<p>time_namelookup The time, in seconds, it took from the
start until the name resolving was completed.</p>

<p>time_connect The time, in seconds, it took from the
start until the TCP connect to the remote host (or proxy)
was completed.</p>

<p>time_appconnect The time, in seconds, it took from the
start until the SSL/SSH/etc connect/handshake to the remote
host was completed. (Added in 7.19.0)</p>

<p>time_pretransfer The time, in seconds, it took from the
start until the file transfer was just about to begin. This
includes all pre-transfer commands and nego- tiations that
are specific to the particular pro- tocol(s) involved.</p>

<p>time_redirect The time, in seconds, it took for all
redirection steps include name lookup, connect, pretransfer
and transfer before the final transaction was started.
time_redirect shows the complete execu- tion time for
multiple redirections. (Added in 7.12.3)</p>

<p>time_starttransfer The time, in seconds, it took from
the start until the first byte was just about to be trans-
ferred. This includes time_pretransfer and also the time the
server needed to calculate the result.</p>

<p>size_download The total amount of bytes that were
downloaded.</p>

<p>size_upload The total amount of bytes that were
uploaded.</p>

<p>size_header The total amount of bytes of the downloaded
head- ers.</p>

<p>size_request The total amount of bytes that were sent in
the HTTP request.</p>

<p>speed_download The average download speed that curl
measured for the complete download.</p>

<p>speed_upload The average upload speed that curl measured
for the complete upload.</p>

<p>content_type The Content-Type of the requested document,
if there was any.</p>

<p>num_connects Number of new connects made in the recent
trans- fer. (Added in 7.12.3)</p>

<p>num_redirects Number of redirects that were followed in
the request. (Added in 7.12.3)</p>

<p>redirect_url When a HTTP request was made without -L to
follow redirects, this variable will show the actual URL a
redirect would take you to. (Added in 7.18.2)</p>

<p>ftp_entry_path The initial path libcurl ended up in when
logging on to the remote FTP server. (Added in 7.15.4)</p>

<p>ssl_verify_result The result of the SSL peer certificate
verifica- tion that was requested. 0 means the verification
was successful. (Added in 7.19.0)</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the last one will
be used.</p>

<p>-x/--proxy &lt;proxyhost[:port]&gt; Use the specified
HTTP proxy. If the port number is not speci- fied, it is
assumed at port 1080.</p>

<p>This option overrides existing environment variables
that set the proxy to use. If theres an environment variable
setting a proxy, you can set proxy to &quot;&quot; to
override it.</p>

<p>Note that all operations that are performed over a HTTP
proxy will transparently be converted to HTTP. It means that
certain protocol specific operations might not be available.
This is not the case if you can tunnel through the proxy, as
done with the -p/--proxytunnel option.</p>

<p>Starting with 7.14.1, the proxy host can be specified
the exact same way as the proxy environment variables,
including the pro- tocol prefix (http://) and the embedded
user + password.</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the last one will
be used.</p>

<p>-X/--request &lt;command&gt; (HTTP) Specifies a custom
request method to use when communicat- ing with the HTTP
server. The specified request will be used instead of the
method otherwise used (which defaults to GET). Read the HTTP
1.1 specification for details and explanations. Common
additional HTTP requests include PUT and DELETE, but related
technologies like WebDAV offers PROPFIND, COPY, MOVE and
more.</p>

<p>(FTP) Specifies a custom FTP command to use instead of
LIST when doing file lists with FTP.</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the last one will
be used.</p>

<p>-y/--speed-time &lt;time&gt; If a download is slower
than speed-limit bytes per second during a speed-time
period, the download gets aborted. If speed-time is used,
the default speed-limit will be 1 unless set with -Y.</p>

<p>This option controls transfers and thus will not affect
slow connects etc. If this is a concern for you, try the
--connect- timeout option.</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the last one will
be used.</p>

<p>-Y/--speed-limit &lt;speed&gt; If a download is slower
than this given speed (in bytes per sec- ond) for speed-time
seconds it gets aborted. speed-time is set with -y and is 30
if not set.</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the last one will
be used.</p>

<p>-z/--time-cond &lt;date expression&gt; (HTTP/FTP)
Request a file that has been modified later than the given
time and date, or one that has been modified before that
time. The date expression can be all sorts of date strings
or if it doesnt match any internal ones, it tries to get the
time from a given file name instead! See the curl_getdate(3)
man pages for date expression details.</p>

<p>Start the date expression with a dash (-) to make it
request for a document that is older than the given
date/time, default is a document that is newer than the
specified date/time.</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the last one will
be used.</p>

<p>--max-redirs &lt;num&gt; Set maximum number of
redirection-followings allowed. If -L/--location is used,
this option can be used to prevent curl from following
redirections &quot;in absurdum&quot;. By default, the limit
is set to 50 redirections. Set this option to -1 to make it
lim- itless.</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the last one will
be used.</p>

<p>-0/--http1.0 (HTTP) Forces curl to issue its requests
using HTTP 1.0 instead of using its internally preferred:
HTTP 1.1.</p>

<p>-1/--tlsv1 (SSL) Forces curl to use TLS version 1 when
negotiating with a remote TLS server.</p>

<p>-2/--sslv2 (SSL) Forces curl to use SSL version 2 when
negotiating with a remote SSL server.</p>

<p>-3/--sslv3 (SSL) Forces curl to use SSL version 3 when
negotiating with a remote SSL server.</p>

<p>-4/--ipv4 If libcurl is capable of resolving an address
to multiple IP versions (which it is if it is IPv6-capable),
this option tells libcurl to resolve names to IPv4 addresses
only.</p>

<p>-6/--ipv6 If libcurl is capable of resolving an address
to multiple IP versions (which it is if it is IPv6-capable),
this option tells libcurl to resolve names to IPv6 addresses
only.</p>

<p>-#/--progress-bar Make curl display progress information
as a progress bar instead of the default statistics.</p>

<p>FILES ~/.curlrc Default config file, see -K/--config for
details.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT The environment variables can be specified
in lower case or upper case. The lower case version has
precedence. http_proxy is an exception as it is only
available in lower case.</p>

<p>http_proxy [protocol://]&lt;host&gt;[:port] Sets the
proxy server to use for HTTP.</p>

<p>HTTPS_PROXY [protocol://]&lt;host&gt;[:port] Sets the
proxy server to use for HTTPS.</p>

<p>FTP_PROXY [protocol://]&lt;host&gt;[:port] Sets the
proxy server to use for FTP.</p>

<p>ALL_PROXY [protocol://]&lt;host&gt;[:port] Sets the
proxy server to use if no protocol-specific proxy is
set.</p>

<p>NO_PROXY &lt;comma-separated list of hosts&gt; list of
host names that shouldnt go through any proxy. If set to a
asterisk * only, it matches all hosts.</p>

<p>EXIT CODES There are a bunch of different error codes
and their corresponding error messages that may appear
during bad conditions. At the time of this writing, the exit
codes are:</p>

<p>1 Unsupported protocol. This build of curl has no
support for this protocol.</p>
