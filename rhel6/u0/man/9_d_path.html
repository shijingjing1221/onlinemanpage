<p>NAME d_path - return the path of a dentry</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS char * d_path(const struct path * path, char *
buf, int buflen);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS path path to report</p>

<p>buf buffer to return value in</p>

<p>buflen buffer length</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Convert a dentry into an ASCII path name. If
the entry has been deleted the string (deleted) is appended.
Note that this is ambiguous.</p>

<p>Returns a pointer into the buffer or an error code if
the path was too long. Note: Callers should use the returned
pointer, not the passed in buffer, to use the name! The
implementation often starts at an offset into the buffer,
and may leave 0 bytes at the start.</p>

<p>buflen should be positive.</p>
