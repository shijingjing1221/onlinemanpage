<p>NAME gfs2_tool - interface to gfs2 ioctl/sysfs calls</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS gfs2_tool COMMAND [OPTION]...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION gfs2_tool is an interface to a variety of
the GFS2 ioctl/sysfs calls. Some of the functions of
gfs_tool have been replaced by standard system tools such as
mount and chattr, so gfs2_tool doesn t have as many options
as gfs_tool used to.</p>

<p>COMMANDS clearflag Flag File1 File2 ... Clear an
attribute flag on a file. This is now obsolete and kept only
for backward compatibility, chattr is the preferred way to
clear attribute flags. See setflag for available flags. This
option will probably be removed at a future date.</p>

<p>freeze MountPoint Freeze (quiesce) a GFS2 cluster.</p>

<p>gettune MountPoint Print out the current values of the
tuning parameters in a run- ning filesystem. A better source
of similar (more comprehensive) information is that in the
/proc/mounts file. Running the mount command with no
arguments will also provide the same informa- tion. This
option is considered obsolete and will probably be removed
at some future date.</p>

<p>journals MountPoint Print out information about the
journals in a mounted filesys- tem.</p>

<p>lockdump MountPoint Print out information about the
locks this machine holds for a given filesystem. This
information is also available via the debugfs glock dump
file, and accessing that file is the pre- ferred method of
obtaining a dump of the glock state.</p>

<p>sb device proto [newvalue] View (and possibly replace)
the name of the locking protocol in the file system
superblock. The file system shouldnt be mounted by any
client when you do this.</p>

<p>sb device table [newvalue] View (and possibly replace)
the name of the locking table in the file system superblock.
The file system shouldnt be mounted by any client when you
do this.</p>

<p>sb device ondisk [newvalue] View (and possibly replace)
the ondisk format number in the file system superblock. The
file system shouldnt be mounted by any client when you do
this. No one should have to use this.</p>

<p>sb device multihost [newvalue] View (and possibly
replace) the multihost format number in the file system
superblock. The file system shouldn t be mounted by any
client when you do this. No one should have to use this.</p>

<p>sb device uuid [newvalue] View (and possibly replace)
the uuid in the file system superblock. The file system
shouldnt be mounted by any client when you do this. The new
uuid value should be in the standard uuid format. For
example: 1AEA8269-15C5-72BD-6D83-8720B17AA4EE</p>

<p>sb device all Print out the superblock.</p>

<p>setflag Flag File1 File2 ... Set an attribute flag on a
file. The currently supported flags are jdata, immutable,
appendonly, noatime, and sync. The chattr command is the
preferred way to set attributes on files. This option will
probably be removed at a future date.</p>

<p>The jdata flag causes all the data written to a file to
be jour- naled. If the jdata flag is set for a directory,
all files and directories subsequently created within that
directory are also journaled. This behavior replaces the old
inherit_jdata flag from gfs. Same as chattr +j.</p>

<p>The immutable flag marks the file immutable. The
behavior is similar to the immutable flag in the ext2/3
filesystems. All write access is denied. Same as chattr
+i.</p>

<p>The appendonly flag causes all data to be written at the
end of the file. Same as chattr +a.</p>

<p>The noatime flag disables updates to the file s access
time. Same as chattr +A.</p>

<p>The sync flag causes data written to the file to be
synced to stable storage immediately. Same as chattr +S.</p>

<p>settune MountPoint parameter newvalue Set the value of
tuning parameter. Use gettune for a listing of tunable
parameters. The mount -oremount command is the preferred way
to set the values of tunable parameters. At some future
stage, when all parameters can be set via mount, this option
will be removed.</p>

<p>unfreeze MountPoint Unfreeze a GFS2 cluster.</p>

<p>version Print out the version of GFS2 that this program
goes with.</p>

<p>withdraw MountPoint Cause GFS2 to abnormally shutdown a
given filesystem on this node. This feature is only useful
for testing and should not be used during normal filesystem
operation.</p>
