<p>GETRLIMIT(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
GETRLIMIT(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME getrlimit, setrlimit - control maximum resource
consumption</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/resource.h&gt;</p>

<p>int getrlimit(int resource, struct rlimit *rlp); int
setrlimit(int resource, const struct rlimit *rlp);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The getrlimit() function shall get, and the
setrlimit() function shall set, limits on the consumption of
a variety of resources.</p>

<p>Each call to either getrlimit() or setrlimit()
identifies a specific resource to be operated upon as well
as a resource limit. A resource limit is represented by an
rlimit structure. The rlim_cur member speci- fies the
current or soft limit and the rlim_max member specifies the
maximum or hard limit. Soft limits may be changed by a
process to any value that is less than or equal to the hard
limit. A process may (irreversibly) lower its hard limit to
any value that is greater than or equal to the soft limit.
Only a process with appropriate privileges can raise a hard
limit. Both hard and soft limits can be changed in a single
call to setrlimit() subject to the constraints described
above.</p>

<p>The value RLIM_INFINITY, defined in
&lt;sys/resource.h&gt;, shall be consid- ered to be larger
than any other limit value. If a call to getrlimit() returns
RLIM_INFINITY for a resource, it means the implementation
shall not enforce limits on that resource. Specifying
RLIM_INFINITY as any resource limit value on a successful
call to setrlimit() shall inhibit enforcement of that
resource limit.</p>

<p>The following resources are defined:</p>

<p>RLIMIT_CORE This is the maximum size of a core file, in
bytes, that may be created by a process. A limit of 0 shall
prevent the creation of a core file. If this limit is
exceeded, the writing of a core file shall terminate at this
size.</p>

<p>RLIMIT_CPU This is the maximum amount of CPU time, in
seconds, used by a process. If this limit is exceeded,
SIGXCPU shall be generated for the process. If the process
is catching or ignoring SIGXCPU, or all threads belonging to
that process are blocking SIGXCPU, the behavior is
unspecified.</p>

<p>RLIMIT_DATA This is the maximum size of a process data
segment, in bytes. If this limit is exceeded, the malloc()
function shall fail with errno set to [ENOMEM].</p>

<p>RLIMIT_FSIZE This is the maximum size of a file, in
bytes, that may be cre- ated by a process. If a write or
truncate operation would cause this limit to be exceeded,
SIGXFSZ shall be generated for the thread. If the thread is
blocking, or the process is catching or ignoring SIGXFSZ,
continued attempts to increase the size of a file from
end-of-file to beyond the limit shall fail with errno set to
[EFBIG].</p>

<p>RLIMIT_NOFILE This is a number one greater than the
maximum value that the system may assign to a newly-created
descriptor. If this limit is exceeded, functions that
allocate a file descriptor shall fail with errno set to
[EMFILE]. This limit constrains the num- ber of file
descriptors that a process may allocate.</p>

<p>RLIMIT_STACK This is the maximum size of a process
stack, in bytes. The implementation does not automatically
grow the stack beyond this limit. If this limit is exceeded,
SIGSEGV shall be generated for the thread. If the thread is
blocking SIGSEGV, or the process is ignoring or catching
SIGSEGV and has not made arrangements to use an alternate
stack, the disposition of SIGSEGV shall be set to SIG_DFL
before it is generated.</p>

<p>RLIMIT_AS This is the maximum size of a process total
available memory, in bytes. If this limit is exceeded, the
malloc() and mmap() functions shall fail with errno set to
[ENOMEM]. In addition, the automatic stack growth fails with
the effects outlined above.</p>

<p>When using the getrlimit() function, if a resource limit
can be repre- sented correctly in an object of type rlim_t,
then its representation is returned; otherwise, if the value
of the resource limit is equal to that of the corresponding
saved hard limit, the value returned shall be
RLIM_SAVED_MAX; otherwise, the value returned shall be
RLIM_SAVED_CUR.</p>

<p>When using the setrlimit() function, if the requested
new limit is RLIM_INFINITY, the new limit shall be &quot;no
limit; otherwise, if the requested new limit is
RLIM_SAVED_MAX, the new limit shall be the cor- responding
saved hard limit; otherwise, if the requested new limit is
RLIM_SAVED_CUR, the new limit shall be the corresponding
saved soft limit; otherwise, the new limit shall be the
requested value. In addi- tion, if the corresponding saved
limit can be represented correctly in an object of type
rlim_t then it shall be overwritten with the new limit.</p>

<p>The result of setting a limit to RLIM_SAVED_MAX or
RLIM_SAVED_CUR is unspecified unless a previous call to
getrlimit() returned that value as the soft or hard limit
for the corresponding resource limit.</p>

<p>The determination of whether a limit can be correctly
represented in an object of type rlim_t is
implementation-defined. For example, some implementations
permit a limit whose value is greater than RLIM_INFIN- ITY
and others do not.</p>

<p>The exec family of functions shall cause resource limits
to be saved.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, getrlimit() and
setrlimit() shall return 0. Otherwise, these functions shall
return -1 and set errno to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The getrlimit() and setrlimit() functions shall
fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL An invalid resource was specified; or in a
setrlimit() call, the new rlim_cur exceeds the new
rlim_max.</p>

<p>EPERM The limit specified to setrlimit() would have
raised the maximum limit value, and the calling process does
not have appropriate privileges.</p>

<p>The setrlimit() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The limit specified cannot be lowered because
current usage is already higher than the limit.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE If a process attempts to set the hard
limit or soft limit for RLIMIT_NOFILE to less than the value
of {_POSIX_OPEN_MAX} from &lt;lim- its.h&gt;, unexpected
behavior may occur.</p>

<p>If a process attempts to set the hard limit or soft
limit for RLIMIT_NOFILE to less than the highest currently
open file descriptor +1, unexpected behavior may occur.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
