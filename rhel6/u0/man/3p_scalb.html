<p>SCALB(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual SCALB(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME scalb - load exponent of a radix-independent
floating-point number</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;math.h&gt;</p>

<p>double scalb(double x, double n);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The scalb() function shall compute x*r**n,
where r is the radix of the machine s floating-point
arithmetic. When r is 2, scalb() shall be equivalent to
ldexp(). The value of r is FLT_RADIX which is defined in
&lt;float.h&gt;.</p>

<p>An application wishing to check for error situations
should set errno to zero and call
feclearexcept(FE_ALL_EXCEPT) before calling these functions.
On return, if errno is non-zero or fetestexcept(FE_INVALID |
FE_DIVBYZERO | FE_OVERFLOW | FE_UNDERFLOW) is non-zero, an
error has occurred.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, the scalb()
function shall return x*r**n.</p>

<p>If x or n is NaN, a NaN shall be returned.</p>

<p>If n is zero, x shall be returned.</p>

<p>If x is &plusmn;Inf and n is not -Inf, x shall be
returned.</p>

<p>If x is &plusmn;0 and n is not +Inf, x shall be
returned.</p>

<p>If x is &plusmn;0 and n is +Inf, a domain error shall
occur, and either a NaN (if supported), or an
implementation-defined value shall be returned.</p>

<p>If x is &plusmn;Inf and n is -Inf, a domain error shall
occur, and either a NaN (if supported), or an
implementation-defined value shall be returned.</p>

<p>If the result would cause an overflow, a range error
shall occur and &plusmn;HUGE_VAL (according to the sign of
x) shall be returned.</p>

<p>If the correct value would cause underflow, and is
representable, a range error may occur and the correct value
shall be returned.</p>

<p>If the correct value would cause underflow, and is not
representable, a range error may occur, and 0.0 shall be
returned.</p>

<p>ERRORS The scalb() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>Domain Error If x is zero and n is +Inf, or x is Inf and
n is -Inf.</p>

<p>If the integer expression (math_errhandling &amp;
MATH_ERRNO) is non-zero, then errno shall be set to [EDOM].
If the integer expression (math_errhandling &amp;
MATH_ERREXCEPT) is non-zero, then the invalid floating-point
exception shall be raised.</p>

<p>Range Error The result would overflow.</p>

<p>If the integer expression (math_errhandling &amp;
MATH_ERRNO) is non-zero, then errno shall be set to
[ERANGE]. If the integer expression (math_errhandling &amp;
MATH_ERREXCEPT) is non-zero, then the overflow
floating-point exception shall be raised.</p>

<p>The scalb() function may fail if:</p>

<p>Range Error The result underflows.</p>

<p>If the integer expression (math_errhandling &amp;
MATH_ERRNO) is non-zero, then errno shall be set to
[ERANGE]. If the integer expression (math_errhandling &amp;
MATH_ERREXCEPT) is non-zero, then the underflow
floating-point exception shall be raised.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE Applications should use either
scalbln(), scalblnf(), or scalblnl() in preference to this
function.</p>

<p>IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 only defines the behavior for the
scalb() function when the n argument is an integer, a NaN,
or Inf. The behavior of other values for the n argument is
unspecified.</p>

<p>On error, the expressions (math_errhandling &amp;
MATH_ERRNO) and (math_errhandling &amp; MATH_ERREXCEPT) are
independent of each other, but at least one of them must be
non-zero.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
