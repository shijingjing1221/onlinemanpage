<p>UNLINK(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual UNLINK(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME unlink - remove a directory entry</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>int unlink(const char *path);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The unlink() function shall remove a link to
a file. If path names a symbolic link, unlink() shall remove
the symbolic link named by path and shall not affect any
file or directory named by the contents of the symbolic
link. Otherwise, unlink() shall remove the link named by the
pathname pointed to by path and shall decrement the link
count of the file referenced by the link.</p>

<p>When the files link count becomes 0 and no process has
the file open, the space occupied by the file shall be freed
and the file shall no longer be accessible. If one or more
processes have the file open when the last link is removed,
the link shall be removed before unlink() returns, but the
removal of the file contents shall be postponed until all
references to the file are closed.</p>

<p>The path argument shall not name a directory unless the
process has appropriate privileges and the implementation
supports using unlink() on directories.</p>

<p>Upon successful completion, unlink() shall mark for
update the st_ctime and st_mtime fields of the parent
directory. Also, if the files link count is not 0, the
st_ctime field of the file shall be marked for update.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, 0 shall be
returned. Otherwise, -1 shall be returned and errno set to
indicate the error. If -1 is returned, the named file shall
not be changed.</p>

<p>ERRORS The unlink() function shall fail and shall not
unlink the file if:</p>

<p>EACCES Search permission is denied for a component of
the path prefix, or write permission is denied on the
directory containing the directory entry to be removed.</p>

<p>EBUSY The file named by the path argument cannot be
unlinked because it is being used by the system or another
process and the imple- mentation considers this an
error.</p>

<p>ELOOP A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during
resolution of the path argument.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG The length of the path argument exceeds
{PATH_MAX} or a pathname component is longer than
{NAME_MAX}.</p>

<p>ENOENT A component of path does not name an existing
file or path is an empty string.</p>

<p>ENOTDIR A component of the path prefix is not a
directory.</p>

<p>EPERM The file named by path is a directory, and either
the calling process does not have appropriate privileges, or
the implementa- tion prohibits using unlink() on
directories.</p>

<p>EPERM or EACCES</p>

<p>The S_ISVTX flag is set on the directory containing the
file referred to by the path argument and the caller is not
the file owner, nor is the caller the directory owner, nor
does the caller have appropriate privileges.</p>

<p>EROFS The directory entry to be unlinked is part of a
read-only file system.</p>

<p>The unlink() function may fail and not unlink the file
if:</p>

<p>EBUSY The file named by path is a named STREAM.</p>

<p>ELOOP More than {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic links were
encountered during resolution of the path argument.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG As a result of encountering a symbolic link
in resolution of the path argument, the length of the
substituted pathname string exceeded {PATH_MAX}.</p>

<p>ETXTBSY The entry to be unlinked is the last directory
entry to a pure procedure (shared text) file that is being
executed.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Removing a Link to a File The following example
shows how to remove a link to a file named /home/cnd/mod1 by
removing the entry named /modules/pass1.</p>

<p>#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>char *path = &quot;/modules/pass1&quot;; int status; ...
status = unlink(path);</p>

<p>Checking for an Error The following example fragment
creates a temporary password lock file named LOCKFILE, which
is defined as /etc/ptmp, and gets a file descrip- tor for
it. If the file cannot be opened for writing, unlink() is
used to remove the link between the file descriptor and
LOCKFILE.</p>

<p>#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;fcntl.h&gt; #include &lt;errno.h&gt; #include
&lt;unistd.h&gt; #include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;</p>

<p>#define LOCKFILE &quot;/etc/ptmp&quot;</p>

<p>int pfd; /* Integer for file descriptor returned by open
call. */ FILE *fpfd; /* File pointer for use in putpwent().
*/ ... /* Open password Lock file. If it exists, this is an
error. */ if ((pfd = open(LOCKFILE, O_WRONLY| O_CREAT |
O_EXCL, S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR | S_IRGRP | S_IROTH)) == -1) {
fprintf(stderr, &quot;Cannot open /etc/ptmp. Try again
latern&quot;); exit(1); }</p>

<p>/* Lock file created; proceed with fdopen of lock file
so that putpwent() can be used. */ if ((fpfd = fdopen(pfd,
&quot;w&quot;)) == NULL) { close(pfd); unlink(LOCKFILE);
exit(1); }</p>

<p>Replacing Files The following example fragment uses
unlink() to discard links to files, so that they can be
replaced with new versions of the files. The first call
removes the link to LOCKFILE if an error occurs. Successive
calls remove the links to SAVEFILE and PASSWDFILE so that
new links can be created, then removes the link to LOCKFILE
when it is no longer needed.</p>

<p>#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;fcntl.h&gt; #include &lt;errno.h&gt; #include
&lt;unistd.h&gt; #include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;</p>

<p>#define LOCKFILE &quot;/etc/ptmp&quot; #define
PASSWDFILE &quot;/etc/passwd&quot; #define SAVEFILE
&quot;/etc/opasswd&quot; ... /* If no change was made,
assume error and leave passwd unchanged. */ if
(!valid_change) { fprintf(stderr, &quot;Could not change
password for user %n&quot;, user); unlink(LOCKFILE);
exit(1); }</p>

<p>/* Change permissions on new password file. */
chmod(LOCKFILE, S_IRUSR | S_IRGRP | S_IROTH);</p>

<p>/* Remove saved password file. */ unlink(SAVEFILE);</p>

<p>/* Save current password file. */ link(PASSWDFILE,
SAVEFILE);</p>

<p>/* Remove current password file. */
unlink(PASSWDFILE);</p>

<p>/* Save new password file as current password file. */
link(LOCKFILE,PASSWDFILE);</p>

<p>/* Remove lock file. */ unlink(LOCKFILE);</p>

<p>exit(0);</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE Applications should use rmdir() to
remove a directory.</p>

<p>RATIONALE Unlinking a directory is restricted to the
superuser in many historical implementations for reasons
given in link() (see also rename()).</p>

<p>The meaning of [EBUSY] in historical implementations is
&quot;mount point busy&quot;. Since this volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001 does not cover the system administration
concepts of mounting and unmounting, the descrip- tion of
the error was changed to &quot;resource busy&quot;. (This
meaning is used by some device drivers when a second process
tries to open an exclusive use device.) The wording is also
intended to allow implementations to refuse to remove a
directory if it is the root or current working directory of
any process.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
