<p>SASLAUTHD(8) BSD System Manager s Manual
SASLAUTHD(8)</p>

<p>NAME saslauthd - sasl authentication server</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS saslauthd -a authmech [-Tvdchlr] [-O option]
[-m mux_path] [-n threads] [-s size] [-t timeout]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION saslauthd is a daemon process that handles
plaintext authentication requests on behalf of the SASL
library.</p>

<p>The server fulfills two roles: it isolates all code
requiring superuser privileges into a single process, and it
can be used to provide proxy authentication services to
clients that do not understand SASL based
authentication.</p>

<p>saslauthd should be started from the system boot scripts
when going to multi-user mode. When running against a
protected authentication database (e.g. the shadow
mechanism), it must be run as the superuser.</p>

<p>Options Options named by lower-case letters configure
the server itself. Upper-case options control the behavior
of specific authentication mecha- nisms; their applicability
to a particular authentication mechanism is described in the
AUTHENTICATION MECHANISMS section.</p>

<p>-a authmech Use authmech as the authentication
mechanism. (See the AUTHENTICATION MECHANISMS section
below.) This parameter is mandatory.</p>

<p>-O option A mechanism specific option (e.g. rimap
hostname or config file path)</p>

<p>-H hostname The remote host to be contacted by the rimap
authentication mech- anism. (Depricated, use -O instead)</p>

<p>-m path Use path as the pathname to the named socket to
listen on for connection requests. This must be an absolute
pathname, and MUST NOT include the trailing
&quot;/mux&quot;. Note that the default for this value is
&quot;/var/state/saslauthd&quot; (or what was specified at
compile time) and that this directory must exist for
saslauthd to func- tion.</p>

<p>-n threads Use threads processes for responding to
authentication queries. (default: 5) A value of zero will
indicate that saslauthd should fork an individual process
for each connection. This can solve leaks that occur in some
deployments..</p>

<p>-s size Use size as the table size of the hash table (in
kilobytes)</p>

<p>-t timeout Use timeout as the expiration time of the
authentication cache (in seconds)</p>

<p>-T Honour time-of-day login restrictions.</p>

<p>-h Show usage information</p>

<p>-c Enable cacheing of authentication credentials</p>

<p>-l Disable the use of a lock file for controlling access
to accept().</p>

<p>-r Combine the realm with the login (with an @ sign in
between). e.g. login: &quot;foo&quot; realm: &quot;bar&quot;
will get passed as login: &quot;foo@bar&quot;. Note that the
realm will still be passed, which may lead to unexpected
behavior.</p>

<p>-v Print the version number and available authentication
mechanisms on standard error, then exit.</p>

<p>-d Debugging mode.</p>

<p>Logging saslauthd logs its activities via syslogd using
the LOG_AUTH facility.</p>

<p>AUTHENTICATION MECHANISMS saslauthd supports one or more
&quot;authentication mechanisms&quot;, dependent upon the
facilities provided by the underlying operating system. The
mechanism is selected by the -aho flag from the following
list of choices:</p>

<p>dce (AIX)</p>

<p>Authenticate using the DCE authentication
environment.</p>

<p>getpwent (All platforms)</p>

<p>Authenticate using the getpwent() library function.
Typically this authenticates against the local password
file. See your systems getpwent(3) man page for details.</p>

<p>kerberos4 (All platforms)</p>

<p>Authenticate against the local Kerberos 4 realm. (See
the NOTES section for caveats about this driver.)</p>

<p>kerberos5 (All platforms)</p>

<p>Authenticate against the local Kerberos 5 realm.</p>

<p>pam (Linux, Solaris)</p>

<p>Authenticate using Pluggable Authentication Modules
(PAM).</p>

<p>rimap (All platforms)</p>

<p>Forward authentication requests to a remote IMAP server.
This driver connects to a remote IMAP server, specified
using the -O flag, and attempts to login (via an IMAP LOGIN
command) using the credentials supplied to the local server.
If the remote authentication succeeds the local connection
is also considered to be authenticated. The remote
connection is closed as soon as the tagged response from the
LOGIN command is received from the remote server.</p>

<p>The option parameter to the -O flag describes the remote
server to forward authentication requests to. hostname can
be a hostname (imap.example.com) or a dotted-quad IP address
(192.168.0.1). The latter is useful if the remote server is
multi-homed and has network interfaces that are unreachable
from the local IMAP server. The remote host is contacted on
the imap service port. A non-default port can be specified
by appending a slash and the port name or number to the
hostname argument.</p>

<p>The -O flag and argument are mandatory when using the
rimap mechanism.</p>

<p>shadow (AIX, Irix, Linux, Solaris)</p>

<p>Authenticate against the local &quot;shadow password
file&quot;. The exact mechanism is system dependent.
saslauthd currently understands the getspnam() and
getuserpw() library routines. Some systems honour the -T
flag.</p>

<p>sasldb (All platforms)</p>

<p>Authenticate against the SASL authentication database.
Note that this is probabally not what you want to be using,
and is even disabled at compile-time by default. If you want
to use sasldb with the SASL library, you probably want to
use the pwcheck_method of &quot;auxprop&quot; along with the
sasldb auxprop plu- gin instead.</p>

<p>ldap (All platforms that support OpenLDAP 2.0 or
higher)</p>

<p>Authenticate against an ldap server. The ldap
configuration parameters are read from /etc/saslauthd.conf.
The location of this file can be changed with the -O
parameter. See the LDAP_SASLAUTHD file included with the
distribution for the list of available parameters.</p>

<p>sia (Digital UNIX)</p>

<p>Authenticate using the Digital UNIX Security Integration
Architecture (a.k.a. &quot;enhanced security&quot;).</p>

<p>NOTES The kerberos4 authentication driver consumes
considerable resources. To perform an authentication it must
obtain a ticket granting ticket from the TGT server on every
authentication request. The Kerberos library rou- tines that
obtain the TGT also create a local ticket file, on the
reason- able assumption that you will want to save the TGT
for use by other Ker- beros applications. These ticket files
are unusable by saslauthd , how- ever there is no way not to
create them. The overhead of creating and removing these
ticket files can cause serious performance degradation on
busy servers. (Kerberos was never intended to be used in
this manner, anyway.)</p>

<p>FILES /var/run/saslauthd/mux The default communications
socket.</p>

<p>/etc/saslauthd.conf The default configuration file for
ldap support.</p>
