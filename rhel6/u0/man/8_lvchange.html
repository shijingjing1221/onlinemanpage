[LogicalVolumePath...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION lvchange allows you to change the attributes
of a logical volume including making them known to the
kernel ready for use.</p>

<p>OPTIONS See lvm for common options.</p>

<p>-a, --available y|n|ey|en|ly|ln Controls the
availability of the logical volumes for use. Com- municates
with the kernel device-mapper driver via libdevmapper to
activate (-ay) or deactivate (-an) the logical volumes.</p>

<p>If clustered locking is enabled, -aey will activate
exclusively on one node and -aly will activate only on the
local node. To deactivate only on the local node use -aln.
Logical volumes with single-host snapshots are always
activated exclusively because they can only be used on one
node at once.</p>

<p>-C, --contiguous y|n Tries to set or reset the
contiguous allocation policy for logi- cal volumes. It s
only possible to change a non-contiguous logi- cal volumes
allocation policy to contiguous, if all of the allocated
physical extents are already contiguous.</p>

<p>--resync Forces the complete resynchronization of a
mirror. In normal circumstances you should not need this
option because synchro- nization happens automatically. Data
is read from the primary mirror device and copied to the
others, so this can take a con- siderable amount of time -
and during this time you are without a complete redundant
copy of your data.</p>

<p>--minor minor Set the minor number.</p>

<p>--monitor y|n Start or stop monitoring a mirrored or
snapshot logical volume with dmeventd, if it is installed.
If a device used by a moni- tored mirror reports an I/O
error, the failure is handled according to
mirror_image_fault_policy and mirror_log_fault_pol- icy set
in lvm.conf.</p>

<p>--poll y|n Without polling a logical volumes
backgrounded transformation process will never complete. If
there is an incomplete pvmove or lvconvert (for example, on
rebooting after a crash), use --poll y to restart the
process from its last checkpoint. How- ever, it may not be
appropriate to immediately poll a logical volume when it is
activated, use --poll n to defer and then --poll y to
restart the process.</p>

<p>--sysinit Indicates that lvchange(8) is being invoked
from early system initialisation scripts (e.g. rc.sysinit or
an initrd), before writeable filesystems are available. As
such, some functionality needs to be disabled and this
option acts as a shortcut which selects an appropriate set
of options. Currently this is equiva- lent to using
--ignorelockingfailure, --ignoremonitoring, --poll n and
setting LVM_SUPPRESS_LOCKING_FAILURE_MESSAGES envi- ronment
variable.</p>

<p>--noudevsync Disable udev synchronisation. The process
will not wait for notification from udev. It will continue
irrespective of any possible udev processing in the
background. You should only use this if udev is not running
or has rules that ignore the devices LVM2 creates.</p>

<p>--ignoremonitoring Make no attempt to interact with
dmeventd unless --monitor is specified. Do not use this if
dmeventd is already monitoring a device.</p>

<p>-M, --persistent y|n Set to y to make the minor number
specified persistent.</p>

<p>-p, --permission r|rw Change access permission to
read-only or read/write.</p>

<p>-r, --readahead ReadAheadSectors|auto|none Set read
ahead sector count of this logical volume. For volume groups
with metadata in lvm1 format, this must be a value between 2
and 120 sectors. The default value is &quot;auto&quot; which
allows the kernel to choose a suitable value automatically.
&quot;None&quot; is equivalent to specifying zero.</p>

<p>--refresh If the logical volume is active, reload its
metadata. This is not necessary in normal operation, but may
be useful if some- thing has gone wrong or if you re doing
clustering manually without a clustered lock manager.</p>

<p>Examples &quot;lvchange -pr vg00/lvol1&quot; changes the
permission on volume lvol1 in volume group vg00 to be
read-only.</p>
