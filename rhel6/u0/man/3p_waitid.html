<p>WAITID(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual WAITID(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME waitid - wait for a child process to change
state</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/wait.h&gt;</p>

<p>int waitid(idtype_t idtype, id_t id, siginfo_t *infop,
int options);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The waitid() function shall suspend the
calling thread until one child of the process containing the
calling thread changes state. It records the current state
of a child in the structure pointed to by infop. If a child
process changed state prior to the call to waitid(),
waitid() shall return immediately. If more than one thread
is suspended in wait() or waitpid() waiting for termination
of the same process, exactly one thread shall return the
process status at the time of the target process
termination.</p>

<p>The idtype and id arguments are used to specify which
children waitid() waits for.</p>

<p>If idtype is P_PID, waitid() shall wait for the child
with a process ID equal to (pid_t)id.</p>

<p>If idtype is P_PGID, waitid() shall wait for any child
with a process group ID equal to (pid_t)id.</p>

<p>If idtype is P_ALL, waitid() shall wait for any children
and id is ignored.</p>

<p>The options argument is used to specify which state
changes waitid() shall wait for. It is formed by ORing
together one or more of the fol- lowing flags:</p>

<p>WEXITED Wait for processes that have exited.</p>

<p>WSTOPPED Status shall be returned for any child that has
stopped upon receipt of a signal.</p>

<p>WCONTINUED Status shall be returned for any child that
was stopped and has been continued.</p>

<p>WNOHANG Return immediately if there are no children to
wait for.</p>

<p>WNOWAIT Keep the process whose status is returned in
infop in a waitable state. This shall not affect the state
of the process; the pro- cess may be waited for again after
this call completes.</p>

<p>The application shall ensure that the infop argument
points to a siginfo_t structure. If waitid() returns because
a child process was found that satisfied the conditions
indicated by the arguments idtype and options, then the
structure pointed to by infop shall be filled in by the
system with the status of the process. The si_signo member
shall always be equal to SIGCHLD.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE If WNOHANG was specified and there are no
children to wait for, 0 shall be returned. If waitid()
returns due to the change of state of one of its children, 0
shall be returned. Otherwise, -1 shall be returned and errno
set to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The waitid() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>ECHILD The calling process has no existing unwaited-for
child pro- cesses.</p>

<p>EINTR The waitid() function was interrupted by a
signal.</p>

<p>EINVAL An invalid value was specified for options, or
idtype and id specify an invalid set of processes.</p>
