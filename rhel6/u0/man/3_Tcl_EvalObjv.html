Tcl_VarEval, Tcl_VarEvalVA - execute Tcl scripts</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tcl.h&gt;</p>

<p>int Tcl_EvalObjEx(interp, objPtr, flags)</p>

<p>int Tcl_EvalFile(interp, fileName)</p>

<p>int Tcl_EvalObjv(interp, objc, objv, flags)</p>

<p>int Tcl_Eval(interp, script)</p>

<p>int Tcl_EvalEx(interp, script, numBytes, flags)</p>

<p>int Tcl_GlobalEval(interp, script)</p>

<p>int Tcl_GlobalEvalObj(interp, objPtr)</p>

<p>int Tcl_VarEval(interp, part, part, ... (char *)
NULL)</p>

<p>int Tcl_VarEvalVA(interp, argList)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS Tcl_Interp *interp (in) Interpreter in which
to execute the script. The interpreters result is modified
to hold the result or error message from the script.</p>

<p>Tcl_Obj *objPtr (in) A Tcl object containing the script
to execute.</p>

<p>int flags (in) ORed combination of flag bits that
specify additional options. TCL_EVAL_GLOBAL and
TCL_EVAL_DIRECT are currently supported.</p>

<p>const char *fileName (in) Name of a file containing a
Tcl script.</p>

<p>int objc (in) The number of objects in the array pointed
to by objPtr; this is also the number of words in the
command.</p>

<p>Tcl_Obj **objv (in) Points to an array of pointers to
objects; each object holds the value of a single word in the
command to execute.</p>

<p>int numBytes (in) The number of bytes in script, not
including any null terminating char- acter. If -1, then all
characters up to the first null byte are used.</p>

<p>const char *script (in) Points to first byte of script
to execute (null-terminated and UTF-8).</p>

<p>char *part (in) String forming part of a Tcl script.</p>

<p>va_list argList (in) An argument list which must have
been initialized using va_start, and cleared using va_end.

<p>DESCRIPTION The procedures described here are invoked to
execute Tcl scripts in various forms. Tcl_EvalObjEx is the
core procedure and is used by many of the others. It
executes the commands in the script stored in objPtr until
either an error occurs or the end of the script is reached.
If this is the first time objPtr has been executed, its
commands are com- piled into bytecode instructions which are
then executed. The byte- codes are saved in objPtr so that
the compilation step can be skipped if the object is
evaluated again in the future.</p>

<p>The return value from Tcl_EvalObjEx (and all the other
procedures described here) is a Tcl completion code with one
of the values TCL_OK, TCL_ERROR, TCL_RETURN, TCL_BREAK, or
TCL_CONTINUE, or possibly some other integer value
originating in an extension. In addition, a result value or
error message is left in interps result; it can be retrieved
using Tcl_GetObjResult.</p>

<p>Tcl_EvalFile reads the file given by fileName and
evaluates its con- tents as a Tcl script. It returns the
same information as Tcl_EvalOb- jEx. If the file could not
be read then a Tcl error is returned to describe why the
file could not be read. The eofchar for files is 32 (^Z) for
all platforms. If you require a ^Z in code for string
comparison, you can use 32 or 001a, which will be safely
sub- stituted by the Tcl interpreter into ^Z.</p>

<p>Tcl_EvalObjv executes a single pre-parsed command
instead of a script. The objc and objv arguments contain the
values of the words for the Tcl command, one word in each
object in objv. Tcl_EvalObjv evaluates the command and
returns a completion code and result just like Tcl_EvalOb-
jEx. The caller of Tcl_EvalObjv has to manage the reference
count of the elements of objv, insuring that the objects are
valid until Tcl_EvalObjv returns.</p>

<p>Tcl_Eval is similar to Tcl_EvalObjEx except that the
script to be exe- cuted is supplied as a string instead of
an object and no compilation occurs. The string should be a
proper UTF-8 string as converted by Tcl_ExternalToUtfDString
or Tcl_ExternalToUtf when it is known to pos- sibly contain
upper ASCII characters whose possible combinations might be
a UTF-8 special code. The string is parsed and executed
directly (using Tcl_EvalObjv) instead of compiling it and
executing the byte- codes. In situations where it is known
that the script will never be executed again, Tcl_Eval may
be faster than Tcl_EvalObjEx. Tcl_Eval returns a completion
code and result just like Tcl_EvalObjEx. Note: for backward
compatibility with versions before Tcl 8.0, Tcl_Eval copies
the object result in interp to interp-&gt;result (use is
depre- cated) where it can be accessed directly. This makes
Tcl_Eval somewhat slower than Tcl_EvalEx, which does not do
the copy.</p>

<p>Tcl_EvalEx is an extended version of Tcl_Eval that takes
additional arguments numBytes and flags. For the efficiency
reason given above, Tcl_EvalEx is generally preferred over
Tcl_Eval.</p>

<p>Tcl_GlobalEval and Tcl_GlobalEvalObj are older
procedures that are now deprecated. They are similar to
Tcl_EvalEx and Tcl_EvalObjEx except that the script is
evaluated in the global namespace and its variable context
consists of global variables only (it ignores any Tcl proce-
dures that are active). These functions are equivalent to
using the TCL_EVAL_GLOBAL flag (see below).</p>

<p>Tcl_VarEval takes any number of string arguments of any
length, con- catenates them into a single string, then calls
Tcl_Eval to execute that string as a Tcl command. It returns
the result of the command and also modifies
interp-&gt;result in the same way as Tcl_Eval. The last
argument to Tcl_VarEval must be NULL to indicate the end of
arguments. Tcl_VarEval is now deprecated.</p>

<p>Tcl_VarEvalVA is the same as Tcl_VarEval except that
instead of taking a variable number of arguments it takes an
argument list. Like Tcl_VarEval, Tcl_VarEvalVA is
deprecated.</p>

<p>FLAG BITS Any ORed combination of the following values
may be used for the flags argument to procedures such as
Tcl_EvalObjEx:</p>

<p>TCL_EVAL_DIRECT This flag is only used by Tcl_EvalObjEx;
it is ignored by other procedures. If this flag bit is set,
the script is not compiled to bytecodes; instead it is
executed directly as is done by Tcl_EvalEx. The
TCL_EVAL_DIRECT flag is useful in situations where the
contents of an object are going to change immediately, so
the byte- codes will not be reused in a future execution. In
this case, it is faster to execute the script directly.</p>

<p>TCL_EVAL_GLOBAL If this flag is set, the script is
processed at global level. This means that it is evaluated
in the global namespace and its variable context consists of
global variables only (it ignores any Tcl procedures at are
active).</p>

<p>MISCELLANEOUS DETAILS During the processing of a Tcl
command it is legal to make nested calls to evaluate other
commands (this is how procedures and some control structures
are implemented). If a code other than TCL_OK is returned
from a nested Tcl_EvalObjEx invocation, then the caller
should normally return immediately, passing that same return
code back to its caller, and so on until the top-level
application is reached. A few commands, like for, will check
for certain return codes, like TCL_BREAK and TCL_CONTINUE,
and process them specially without returning.</p>

<p>Tcl_EvalObjEx keeps track of how many nested
Tcl_EvalObjEx invocations are in progress for interp. If a
code of TCL_RETURN, TCL_BREAK, or TCL_CONTINUE is about to
be returned from the topmost Tcl_EvalObjEx invocation for
interp, it converts the return code to TCL_ERROR and sets
interps result to an error message indicating that the
return, break, or continue command was invoked in an
inappropriate place. This means that top-level applications
should never see a return code from Tcl_EvalObjEx other then
TCL_OK or TCL_ERROR.</p>
