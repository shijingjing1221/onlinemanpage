<p>NAME rpcbind - universal addresses to RPC program number
mapper</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rpcbind [-adhiLls]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The rpcbind utility is a server that
converts RPC program numbers into universal addresses. It
must be running on the host to be able to make RPC calls on
a server on that machine.</p>

<p>When an RPC service is started, it tells rpcbind the
address at which it is listening, and the RPC program
numbers it is prepared to serve. When a client wishes to
make an RPC call to a given program number, it first
contacts rpcbind on the server machine to determine the
address where RPC requests should be sent.</p>

<p>The rpcbind utility should be started before any other
RPC service. Nor- mally, standard RPC servers are started by
port monitors, so rpcbind must be started before port
monitors are invoked.</p>

<p>When rpcbind is started, it checks that certain
name-to-address transla- tion-calls function correctly. If
they fail, the network configuration databases may be
corrupt. Since RPC services cannot function correctly in
this situation, rpcbind reports the condition and
terminates.</p>

<p>The rpcbind utility can only be started by the
super-user.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -a When debugging (-d), do an abort on
errors.</p>

<p>-d Run in debug mode. In this mode, rpcbind will not
fork when it starts, will print additional information
during operation, and will abort on certain errors if -a is
also specified. With this option, the name-to-address
translation consistency checks are shown in detail.</p>

<p>-h Specify specific IP addresses to bind to for UDP
requests. This option may be specified multiple times and is
typically necessary when running on a multi-homed host. If
no -h option is speci- fied, rpcbind will bind to
INADDR_ANY, which could lead to prob- lems on a multi-homed
host due to rpcbind returning a UDP packet from a different
IP address than it was sent to. Note that when specifying IP
addresses with -h, rpcbind will automatically add 127.0.0.1
and if IPv6 is enabled, ::1 to the list.</p>

<p>-i Insecure mode. Allow calls to SET and UNSET from any
host. Normally rpcbind accepts these requests only from the
loopback interface for security reasons. This change is
necessary for programs that were compiled with earlier
versions of the rpc library and do not make those requests
using the loopback inter- face.</p>

<p>-l Turn on libwrap connection logging.</p>

<p>-s Cause rpcbind to change to the user daemon as soon as
possible. This causes rpcbind to use non-privileged ports
for outgoing con- nections, preventing non-privileged
clients from using rpcbind to connect to services from a
privileged port.</p>

<p>-w Cause rpcbind to do a &quot;warm start&quot; by read
a state file when rpcbind starts up. The state file is
created when rpcbind termi- nates.</p>

<p>NOTES All RPC servers must be restarted if rpcbind is
restarted.</p>
