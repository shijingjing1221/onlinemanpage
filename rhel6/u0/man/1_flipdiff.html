<p>NAME flipdiff - exchange the order of two incremental
patches</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS flipdiff [[-p n] | [--strip-match=n]] [[-U n] |
[--unified=n]] [[-d PAT] | [--drop-context=PAT]] [[-q] |
[--quiet]] [[-z] | [--decompress]] [[-b] |
[--ignore-space-change]] [[-B] | [--ignore-blank-lines]]
[[-i] | [--ignore-case]] [[-w] | [--ignore-all-space]]
[--in-place] diff1 diff2</p>

<p>flipdiff {[--help] | [--version]}</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION flipdiff exchanges the order of two patch
files that apply one after the other. The patches must be
clean: the context lines must match and there should be no
mis-matched offsets.</p>

<p>The swapped patches are sent to standard output, with a
marker line ( === 8&lt; === cut here === 8&lt; ===) between
them, unless the --in-place option is passed. In that case,
the output is written back to the original input files.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -p n, --strip-match=n When comparing filenames,
ignore the first n pathname components from both patches.
(This is similar to the -p option to GNU patch(1).)</p>

<p>-q, --quiet Quieter output. Don&acute;t emit rationale
lines at the beginning of each patch.</p>

<p>-U n, --unified=n Attempt to display n lines of context
(requires at least n lines of context in both input files).
(This is similar to the -U option to GNU diff(1).)</p>

<p>-d pattern, --drop-context=PATTERN Don&acute;t display
any context on files that match the shell wildcard pattern.
This option can be given multiple times.</p>

<p>Note that the interpretation of the shell wildcard
pattern does not count slash characters or periods as
special (in other words, no flags are given to fnmatch).
This is so that */basename-type patterns can be given
without limiting the number of pathname components.</p>

<p>-i, --ignore-case Consider upper- and lower-case to be
the same.</p>

<p>-w, --ignore-all-space Ignore whitespace changes in
patches.</p>

<p>-b, --ignore-space-change Ignore changes in the amount
of whitespace.</p>

<p>-B, --ignore-blank-lines Ignore changes whose lines are
all blank.</p>

<p>-z, --decompress Decompress files with extensions .gz
and .bz2.</p>

<p>--in-place Write output to the original input files.</p>

<p>--help Display a short usage message.</p>

<p>--version Display the version number of flipdiff.</p>

<p>LIMITATIONS This is only been very lightly tested, and
may not even work. Using --in-place is not recommended at
the moment.</p>

<p>There are some cases in which it is not possible to
meaningfully flip patches without understanding the
semantics of the content. This program only uses complete
lines that appear at some stage during the application of
the two patches, and never composes a line from parts.</p>

<p>Because of this, it is generally a good idea to read
through the output to check that it makes sense.</p>
