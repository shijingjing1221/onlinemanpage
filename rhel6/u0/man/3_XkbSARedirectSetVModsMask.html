<p>XkbSARedirectSetVModsMask(3) XKB FUNCTIONS
XkbSARedirectSetVModsMask(3)</p>

<p>NAME XkbSARedirectSetVModsMask - Sets the vmods_mask0
and vmods_mask1 fields of act from vm</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS void XkbSARedirectSetVModsMask
(XkbRedirectKeyAction act, unsigned int vm);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS - act action in which to set vmods</p>

<p>- vm new value for virtual modifier mask</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Actions associated with the
XkbRedirectKeyAction structure generate KeyPress and
KeyRelease events containing a keycode different from the
key that was pressed or released.</p>

<p>The type field for the XkbRedirectKeyAction structure
should always be XkbSA_RedirectKey. Key presses cause a
KeyPress event for the key specified by the new_key field
instead of the actual key. The state reported in this event
reports the current effective modifiers changed as follows:
any real modifiers selected by the mods_mask field are set
to corresponding values from the mods field. Any real
modifiers bound to the virtual modifiers specified by the
vmods_mask0 and vmods_mask1 fields are either set or
cleared, depending on the corresponding values in the vmods0
and vmods1 fields. If the real and virtual modifier defi-
nitions specify conflicting values for a single modifier,
the real mod- ifier definition has priority.</p>

<p>Key releases cause a KeyRelease event for the key
specified by the new_key field instead of the actual key.
The state for this event con- sists of the effective
keyboard modifiers at the time of the release, changed as
described previously.</p>

<p>The XkbSA_RedirectKey action normally redirects to
another key on the same device as the key that caused the
event, unless that device does not belong to the input
extension KeyClass, in which case this action causes an
event on the core keyboard device. (The input extension
cate- gorizes devices by breaking them into classes.
Keyboards, and other input devices with keys, are classified
as KeyClass devices by the input extension.)</p>

<p>The vmods_mask0 and vmods_mask1 fields actually
represent one vmods_mask value. Xkb provides macros to
convert between the two for- mats.</p>

<p>XkbSARedirectSetVModsMask sets the vmods_mask0 and
vmods_mask1 fields of act from vm.</p>
