<p>SPAWN(8) SPAWN(8)</p>

<p>NAME spawn - Postfix external command spawner</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS spawn [generic Postfix daemon options]
command_attributes...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The spawn(8) daemon provides the Postfix
equivalent of inetd. It lis- tens on a port as specified in
the Postfix master.cf file and spawns an external command
whenever a connection is established. The connection can be
made over local IPC (such as UNIX-domain sockets) or over
non- local IPC (such as TCP sockets). The command&acute;s
standard input, output and error streams are connected
directly to the communication endpoint.</p>

<p>This daemon expects to be run from the master(8) process
manager.</p>

<p>COMMAND ATTRIBUTE SYNTAX The external command attributes
are given in the master.cf file at the end of a service
definition. The syntax is as follows:</p>

<p>user=username (required)</p>

<p>user=username:groupname The external command is executed
with the rights of the speci- fied username. The software
refuses to execute commands with root privileges, or with
the privileges of the mail system owner. If groupname is
specified, the corresponding group ID is used instead of the
group ID of username.</p>

<p>argv=command... (required) The command to be executed.
This must be specified as the last command attribute. The
command is executed directly, i.e. with- out interpretation
of shell meta characters by a shell command interpreter.</p>

<p>BUGS In order to enforce standard Postfix process
resource controls, the spawn(8) daemon runs only one
external command at a time. As such, it presents a
noticeable overhead by wasting precious process resources.
The spawn(8) daemon is expected to be replaced by a more
structural solution.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS The spawn(8) daemon reports abnormal child
exits. Problems are logged to syslogd(8).</p>

<p>SECURITY This program needs root privilege in order to
execute external commands as the specified user. It is
therefore security sensitive. However the spawn(8) daemon
does not talk to the external command and thus is not
vulnerable to data-driven attacks.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS Changes to main.cf are picked
up automatically as spawn(8) processes run for only a
limited amount of time. Use the command &quot;postfix
reload&quot; to speed up a change.</p>

<p>The text below provides only a parameter summary. See
postconf(5) for more details including examples.</p>

<p>In the text below, transport is the first field of the
entry in the master.cf file.</p>

<p>RESOURCE AND RATE CONTROL transport_time_limit
($command_time_limit) The amount of time the command is
allowed to run before it is terminated.</p>

<p>Postfix 2.4 and later support a suffix that specifies
the time unit: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d
(days), w (weeks). The default time unit is seconds.</p>

<p>MISCELLANEOUS config_directory (seepostconf -doutput)
The default location of the Postfix main.cf and master.cf
con- figuration files.</p>

<p>daemon_timeout (18000s) How much time a Postfix daemon
process may take to handle a request before it is terminated
by a built-in watchdog timer.</p>

<p>export_environment (seepostconf -doutput) The list of
environment variables that a Postfix process will export to
non-Postfix processes.</p>

<p>ipc_timeout (3600s) The time limit for sending or
receiving information over an internal communication
channel.</p>

<p>mail_owner (postfix) The UNIX system account that owns
the Postfix queue and most Postfix daemon processes.</p>

<p>max_idle (100s) The maximum amount of time that an idle
Postfix daemon process waits for an incoming connection
before terminating voluntarily.</p>

<p>max_use (100) The maximal number of incoming connections
that a Postfix daemon process will service before
terminating voluntarily.</p>

<p>process_id (read-only) The process ID of a Postfix
command or daemon process.</p>

<p>process_name (read-only) The process name of a Postfix
command or daemon process.</p>

<p>queue_directory (seepostconf -doutput) The location of
the Postfix top-level queue directory.</p>

<p>syslog_facility (mail) The syslog facility of Postfix
logging.</p>

<p>syslog_name (seepostconf -doutput) The mail system name
that is prepended to the process name in syslog records, so
that &quot;smtpd&quot; becomes, for example, &quot;post-
fix/smtpd&quot;.</p>
