<p>NAME ppmbrighten - change a PPM images Saturation and
Value</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ppmbrighten [-normalize] [-saturation
[+|-saturation_percent]] [-value [+|-value_percent]]
ppmfile</p>

<p>OPTION USAGE All options can be abbreviated to their
shortest unique prefix.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>ppmbrighten increases or decreases the Saturation and
Value (from the HSV color space) of each pixel of a PPM
image. You specify the per centage change for each of those
parameters.</p>

<p>You can also remap the colors of the pixels so their
Values cover the full range of possible Values.</p>

<p>Hue-Saturation-Value, or HSV, is one way to represent a
color, like the more well-known RGB. Hue, Saturation, and
Value are numbers in the range from 0 to 1. We always
capitalize them in this document when we mean the number
from the HSV color space, especially since &quot;value&quot;
as a conventional English word has a much more abstract
meaning.</p>

<p>Value is a measure of how much total light intensity is
in the color, relative to some specified maximum (the PPM
format is also defined in terms of a specified maximum
intensity -- For the purposes of this pro- gram, they are
the same). In particular, it is the intensity of the most
intense primary color component of the color divided by the
maxi- mum intensity possible for a component. Zero Value
means black. White has full Value.</p>

<p>Hue is an indication of the secondary color with the
same intensity that most closely approximates the color. A
secondary color is made of a combination of at most two of
the primary colors.</p>

<p>Saturation is a measure of how close the color is to the
color indi- cated by the Hue and Value. A lower number means
more light of the third primary color must be added to get
the exact color. Full Satura- tion means the color is a
secondary color. Zero Saturation means the color is gray (or
black or white). Decreasing the saturation of a color tends
to make it washed out.</p>

<p>If it is impossible to increase the Value of a pixel by
the amount you specify (e.g. the Value is .5 and you specify
+200%), ppmbrighten increases it to full Value instead.</p>

<p>If it is impossible to increase the Saturation of a
pixel by the amount you specify (e.g. it is already half
saturated and you specify +200%), ppmbrighten increases it
to full Saturation instead.</p>

<p>For a simpler kind of brightening, you can use pamfunc
-multiplier sim- ply to increase the intensity of each pixel
by a specified per centage, clipping each RGB component
where the calculated intensity would exceed full intensity.
Thus, the brightest colors in the image would change
chromaticity in addition to not getting the specified
intensity boost. For decreasing brightness, pamfunc should
do the same thing as ppmbrighten.</p>

<p>ppmflash does another kind of brightening. It changes
the color of each pixel to bring it a specified per centage
closer to white. This increases the value and
saturation.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES To double the Value of each pixel: ppmbrighten
-v 100</p>

<p>To double the Saturation and halve the value of each
pixel: ppmbrighten -s 100 -v -50</p>

<p>OPTIONS -value value_percent This option specifies the
amount, as a per centage, by which you want to change the
Value of each pixel. It may be negative.</p>

<p>-saturation value_percent This option specifies the
amount, as a per centage, by which you want to change the
Saturation of each pixel. It may be nega- tive.</p>

<p>-normalize This option causes ppmbrighten to linearly
remap the Values of the pixels to cover the range 0 to 1.
The option name is wrong -- this operation is not
normalization (it was named in error and the name has been
kept for backward compatibility).</p>

<p>ppmbrighten applies the brightening that you specify
with the -value option after the remapping.</p>

<p>Before Netpbm 10.14 (March 2003), your input must be
from a seekable file (not a pipe) to use -normalize. If it
isnt, the program fails with a bogus error message.</p>
