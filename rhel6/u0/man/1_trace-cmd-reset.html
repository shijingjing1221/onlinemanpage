<p>TRACE-CMD-RESET(1) [FIXME: manual]
TRACE-CMD-RESET(1)</p>

<p>NAME trace-cmd-reset - turn off all Ftrace tracing to
bring back full performance</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS trace-cmd reset [OPTIONS]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The trace-cmd(1) reset command turns off all
tracing of Ftrace. This will bring back the performance of
the system before tracing was enabled. This is necessary
since trace-cmd-record(1), trace-cmd-stop(1) and
trace-cmd-extract(1) do not disable the tracer, event after
the data has been pulled from the buffers. The rational is
that the user may want to manually enable the tracer with
the Ftrace pseudo file system, or examine other parts of
Ftrace to see what trace-cmd did. After the reset command
happens, the data in the ring buffer, and the options that
were used are all lost.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -b buffer_size When the kernel boots, the Ftrace
ring buffer is of a minimal size (3 pages per CPU). The
first time the tracer is used, the ring buffer size expands
to what it was set for (default 1.4 Megs per CPU).</p>

<p>If no more tracing is to be done, this option allows you
to shrink the ring buffer down to free up available
memory.</p>
