<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME Tk_InitStubs - initialize the Tk stubs
mechanism</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tk.h&gt;</p>

<p>const char * Tk_InitStubs(interp, version, exact)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS Tcl_Interp *interp (in) Tcl interpreter
handle.</p>

<p>char *version (in) A version string consisting of one or
more decimal numbers separated by dots.</p>

<p>int exact (in) Non-zero means that only the particu- lar
Tk version specified by version is acceptable. Zero means
that versions newer than version are also acceptable as long
as they have the same major version number as version.

<p>INTRODUCTION The Tcl stubs mechanism defines a way to
dynamically bind extensions to a particular Tcl
implementation at run time. the stubs mechanism requires no
changes to applications incoporating Tcl/Tk interpreters.
Only developers creating C-based Tcl/Tk extensions need to
take steps to use the stubs mechanism with their extensions.
See the Tcl_Init- Stubs page for more information.</p>

<p>Enabling the stubs mechanism for a Tcl/Tk extension
requires the fol- lowing steps:</p>

<p>1) Call Tcl_InitStubs in the extension before calling
any other Tcl functions.</p>

<p>2) Call Tk_InitStubs if the extension before calling any
other Tk functions.</p>

<p>2) Define the USE_TCL_STUBS symbol. Typically, you would
include the -DUSE_TCL_STUBS flag when compiling the
extension.</p>

<p>3) Link the extension with the Tcl and Tk stubs
libraries instead of the standard Tcl and Tk libraries. On
Unix platforms, the library names are libtclstub8.4.a and
libtkstub8.4.a; on Windows plat- forms, the library names
are tclstub84.lib and tkstub84.lib (adjust names with
appropriate version number).</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Tk_InitStubs attempts to initialize the Tk
stub table pointers and ensure that the correct version of
Tk is loaded. In addition to an interpreter handle, it
accepts as arguments a version number and a Boolean flag
indicating whether the extension requires an exact version
match or not. If exact is 0, then the extension is
indicating that newer versions of Tk are acceptable as long
as they have the same major version number as version;
non-zero means that only the specified ver- sion is
acceptable. Tcl_InitStubs returns a string containing the
actual version of Tk satisfying the request, or NULL if the
Tk version is not acceptable, does not support the stubs
mechanism, or any other error condition occurred.</p>
