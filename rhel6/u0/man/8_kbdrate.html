<p>NAME kbdrate - reset the keyboard repeat rate and delay
time</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS kbdrate [ -s ] [ -r rate ] [ -d delay ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION kbdrate is used to change the keyboard
repeat rate and delay time. The delay is the amount of time
that a key must be depressed before it will start to
repeat.</p>

<p>Using kbdrate without any options will reset the repeat
rate to 10.9 characters per second (cps) and the delay to
250 milliseconds (ms) for Intel- and M68K-based systems.
These are the IBM defaults. On SPARC- based systems it will
reset the repeat rate to 20 cps and the delay to 200 ms.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -s Silent. No messages are printed.</p>

<p>-r rate Change the keyboard repeat rate to rate cps. For
Intel-based systems, the allowable range is from 2.0 to 30.0
cps. Only cer- tain, specific values are possible, and the
program will select the nearest possible value to the one
specified. The possible values are given, in characters per
second, as follows: 2.0, 2.1, 2.3, 2.5, 2.7, 3.0, 3.3, 3.7,
4.0, 4.3, 4.6, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.7, 7.5, 8.0, 8.6, 9.2, 10.0,
10.9, 12.0, 13.3, 15.0, 16.0, 17.1, 18.5, 20.0, 21.8, 24.0,
26.7, 30.0. For SPARC-based sys- tems, the allowable range
is from 0 (no repeat) to 50 cps.</p>

<p>-d delay Change the delay to delay milliseconds. For
Intel-based sys- tems, the allowable range is from 250 to
1000 ms, in 250 ms steps. For SPARC systems, possible values
are between 10 ms and 1440 ms, in 10 ms steps.</p>

<p>-V Display a version number and exit.</p>

<p>BUGS Not all keyboards support all rates.</p>

<p>Not all keyboards have the rates mapped in the same
way.</p>

<p>Setting the repeat rate on the Gateway AnyKey keyboard
does not work. If someone with a Gateway figures out how to
program the keyboard, please send mail to
util-linux@math.uio.no.</p>

<p>All this is very architecture dependent. Nowadays
kbdrate first tries the KDKBDREP and KIOCSRATE ioctls. (The
former usually works on an m68k machine, the latter for
SPARC.) When these ioctls fail an ioport interface as on
i386 is assumed.</p>
