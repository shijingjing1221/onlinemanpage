<p>DESCRIPTION The fcoeadm utility is the Fibre Channel
over Ethernet (FCoE) management tool for the Open-FCoE
project. fcoeadm may be used to create, destroy, and reset
an FCoE instance on a given network interface. For these
operations fcoeadm sends a command to a running fcoemon
process, via a socket interface. fcoemon will then perform
the requested operation.</p>

<p>fcoeadm also provides options to query information about
FCoE instances, including interface information, target
information, LUN information, and port statistics. For much
of this information, fcoeadm relies on the libhbalinux
implementation of the HBA API.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -c, --create ethX Creates an FCoE instance based
on the specified network interface. Note that if there is
not an fcoemon configuration file for the interface
(/etc/fcoe/cfg-ethX, see fcoemon), then the created FCoE
instance will not require DCB.</p>

<p>-d, --destroy ethX Destroys the FCoE instance on the
specified network interface.</p>

<p>-r, --reset ethX Resets the FCoE instance on the
specified network interface.</p>

<p>-i, --interface [ethX] Show information about the FCoE
instance on the specified network interface, or all FCoE
instances if no network interface is specified.</p>

<p>-t, --target [ethX] Show information about the
discovered targets associated with the FCoE instance on the
specified network interface. If no network interface is
specified, information about discovered targets from all
FCoE instances will be shown.</p>

<p>-l, --lun [ethX] Show detailed information about the
discovered SCSI LUNs associated with the FCoE instance on
the specified network interface. If no network interface is
specified, information about SCSI LUNs from all FCoE
instances will be shown.</p>

<p>-s, --stats ethX [interval] Show the statistics
(including FC4 statistics) of the FCoE interface on the
specified network interface. The information will be display
in one line on the screen per given time interval. interval
should be specified in whole integers greater than 0. It
specifies the time interval in the unit of seconds. If
interval is not specified, the default interval is one
second.</p>

<p>-h, --help Displays the usage message of the fcoeadm
command.</p>

<p>-v, --version Displays the version of the fcoeadm
command.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Creates an FCoE instance on eth2.101</p>

<p>fcoeadm -c eth2.101</p>

<p>Destroys the FCoE instance on eth2.101</p>

<p>fcoeadm -d eth2.101</p>

<p>Resets the FCoE instance on eth2.101</p>

<p>fcoeadm -r eth2.101</p>

<p>Show the information of all the adapters and their ports
having FCoE instances created</p>

<p>fcoeadm -i</p>

<p>Show the information of a specific interface eth3. If
eth3 has no FCoE instances created, the command will show
the error &quot;No fc_host found for eth3&quot;</p>

<p>fcoeadm -i eth3</p>

<p>Show the information of all the discovered targets from
all the ports having FCoE instances created (they may be on
different adapter cards). A brief listing of discovered LUNs
are listed after the target they are associated with, if
any</p>

<p>fcoeadm -t</p>

<p>Show the information of all the discovered targets from
a given port (eth3) having FCoE instance created. A brief
listing of discovered LUNs are listed after each target they
are associated with, if any</p>

<p>fcoeadm -t eth3</p>

<p>Show the detailed information of all the LUNs discovered
on all FCoE connections</p>

<p>fcoeadm -l</p>

<p>Show the detailed information of all the LUNs associated
with a specific interface</p>

<p>fcoeadm -l eth3.101</p>

<p>Show the statistics information of a specific port eth3
having FCoE instances created. The statistics are displayed
one line per time interval. The default interval is one
second if an interval is not specified</p>

<p>fcoeadm -s eth3</p>

<p>fcoeadm -s eth3 3</p>
