<p>report.conf(5) report configuration file
report.conf(5)</p>

<p>NAME report.conf - Configuration file for report.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Report uses a configuration file at
/etc/report.conf.</p>

<p>Additional configuration files are also read from
/etc/report.d. All configuration files of the form
&quot;/etc/report.d/*.conf&quot; are read along with
&quot;/etc/report.conf&quot;.</p>

<p>PARAMETERS There are two kinds of configuration
sections. The &quot;[main]&quot; configura- tion section
specifies options for all of the report library. All other
configuration sections create new targets, where the name of
the section becomes the name of the target. Each target
section must specify a plugin option to specify the plugin
to be used for that target. Each target should specify a
description for the target. Other target options are
specific to the plugin used for that target. The same plugin
may be used for multiple targets, so that for example you
can configure two different SCP locations. Any plugin that
is shipped with report will have its parameters defined
here, however, any 3rd party plugins will need additional
documentation provided by its maintainer.</p>

<p>[main] OPTIONS target Default target to be used.</p>

<p>loglevel Set a syslog priority and facility when
logging</p>

<p>OPTIONS for all target sections plugin The plugin to use
for this target.</p>

logging</p>
