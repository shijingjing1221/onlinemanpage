<p>NAME xlsfonts - server font list displayer for X</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS xlsfonts [-display host:dpy] [-l] [-ll] [-lll]
[-m] [-C] [-1] [-w width] [-n columns] [-u] [-o] [-fn
pattern] xlsfonts -printer printername [-l] [-ll] [-lll]
[-m] [-C] [-1] [-w width] [-n columns] [-u] [-o] [-r
resolution] [-b] [-B] [-g] [-G] [-x mode] [-X mode] [-fn
pattern]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION xlsfonts lists the fonts that match the
given pattern. The wildcard character &quot;*&quot; may be
used to match any sequence of characters (includ- ing none),
and &quot;?&quot; to match any single character. If no
pattern is given, &quot;*&quot; is assumed.</p>

<p>The &quot;*&quot; and &quot;?&quot; characters must be
quoted to prevent them from being expanded by the shell.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -display host:dpy This option specifies the X
server to contact.</p>

<p>-printer printername This option specifies the Xprint
printer to contact.</p>

<p>-d host:dpy Same as -display host:dpy.</p>

<p>-p printername Same as -printer printername.</p>

<p>-l Lists some attributes of the font on one line in
addition to its name.</p>

<p>-ll Lists font properties in addition to -l output.</p>

<p>-lll Lists character metrics in addition to -ll
output.</p>

<p>-m This option indicates that long listings should also
print the minimum and maximum bounds of each font.</p>

<p>-C This option indicates that listings should use
multiple columns. This is the same as -n 0.</p>

<p>-1 This option indicates that listings should use a
single column. This is the same as -n 1.</p>

<p>-w width This option specifies the width in characters
that should be used in figuring out how many columns to
print. The default is 79.</p>

<p>-n columns This option specifies the number of columns
to use in displaying the output. By default, it will attempt
to fit as many columns of font names into the number of
character specified by -w width.</p>

<p>-u This option indicates that the output should be left
unsorted.</p>

<p>-o This option indicates that xlsfonts should do an
OpenFont (and QueryFont, if appropriate) rather than a
ListFonts. This is useful if ListFonts or ListFontsWithInfo
fail to list a known font (as is the case with some scaled
font systems).</p>

<p>-r resolutionname Set print resolution name (usually
values like 300dpi or 300x600, see output of xplsprinters).
This may alter the output of xlsfonts if there are printer
fonts which get enabled/dis- abled on per-resolution basis
by the DDX.</p>

<p>(printer mode only)</p>

<p>-b List printer builtin fonts. This is the same as -x
xp-list-internal-printer-fonts.</p>

<p>(printer mode only)</p>

<p>-B Do not list printer builtin fonts. This is the same
as -X xp-list-internal-printer-fonts.</p>

<p>(printer mode only)</p>

<p>-g List glyph fonts. This is the same as -x
xp-list-glyph-fonts.</p>

<p>(printer mode only)</p>

<p>-G Do not list glyph fonts. This is the same as -X
xp-list-glyph-fonts.</p>

<p>(printer mode only)</p>

<p>-x mode Enable listfont mode mode.</p>

<p>Supported modes are:</p>

<p>xp-listinternal-printer-fonts If
xp-listinternal-printer-fonts was set (via option -b or -x
xp-listinternal-printer-fonts xlsfonts will include all of
the fonts defined as internal printer fonts.</p>

<p>xp-list-glyph-fonts If xp-list-glyph-fonts was set (via
option -g or -x xp-list-glyph-fonts) xlsfonts will include
all of the fonts available to the server which have glyphs
associ- ated with them.</p>

<p>The default value is implicitly determined by the ddx
driver to be the all of the listfonts modes specified in the
xp-listfonts-modes-sup- ported printer attribute.</p>

<p>The value of xp-listfonts-modes-supported and
xp-listfonts-modes (the defaults) can be looked-up via
xplsprinters(1).</p>

<p>(printer mode only)</p>

<p>-X mode Disable listfont mode mode. See option -x for a
list of valid mode values.</p>

<p>(printer mode only)</p>

<p>-fn pattern This option specifies the font name pattern
to match.</p>

xplsprinters(1), X Logi- cal Font Description
Conventions</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT DISPLAY DISPLAY must be set to get the
default host and display to use.</p>

<p>XPSERVERLIST XPSERVERLIST must be set for the -printer
option identifying the available Xprint servers. See
Xprint(7) for more details.</p>

<p>BUGS Doing xlsfonts -l can tie up your server for a very
long time. This is really a bug with single-threaded
non-preemptable servers, not with this program.</p>
