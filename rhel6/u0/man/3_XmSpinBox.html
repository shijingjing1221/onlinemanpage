<p>NAME XmSpinBox The SpinBox widget class</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;Xm/SpinB.h&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION SpinBox allows the user to select a value
from a ring of related but mutually exclusive choices which
are displayed in sequence. The SpinBox always has an
increment arrow, a decrement arrow, and one or more other
children. The choices are displayed, one at a time, in a
traversable text child ( XmText or XmTextField. The user
clicks &lt;Btn1&gt; on an arrow to display the next (or
previous) item in the ring of choices. By pressing and
holding &lt;Btn1&gt; on an arrow, the user continuously
cycles through the choices.</p>

<p>The traversable children in a SpinBox can be of type
XmNUMERIC or XmSTRING, as defined by the XmNspinBoxChildType
constraint resource. The ring of choices for numeric
children is defined by minimum, maxi- mum, incremental, and
decimal point values. The ring of choices for string
children is defined in an array of compound strings.</p>

<p>The application programmer can include multiple
traversable children in the SpinBox. For example, a SpinBox
might consist of a pair of arrows and month, day, and year
text fields. The arrows only spin the child that currently
has focus.</p>

<p>Arrow size is specified by the SpinBox resource
XmNarrowSize. This value sets both width and height of each
arrow in pixels.</p>

<p>The programmer can display SpinBox arrows in one of
several layouts, as specified by the XmNarrowLayout
resource:</p>

<p>XmARROWS_BEGINNING Places a pair of left and right
arrows before the children.</p>

<p>XmARROWS_END Places a pair of left and right arrows
after the children.</p>

<p>XmARROWS_SPLIT Places one arrow on each side of the
children.</p>

<p>XmARROWS_FLAT_BEGINNING Places a pair of arrows side by
side before the XmSpinBox children.</p>

<p>XmARROWS_FLAT_BEGINNING Places a pair of arrows side by
side after the XmSpinBox children.</p>

<p>Positions for XmARROWS_BEGINNING and XmARROWS_END are
dependent on the VendorShell resource XmNlayoutDirection.
When layout direction is left- to-right, beginning arrows
are positioned to the left of the children. When layout
direction is right-to-left, beginning arrows are positioned
to the right.</p>

<p>The actions of the arrows are determined by the
VendorShell resource XmNlayoutDirection. For left-to-right
layouts, the right arrow is the increment arrow and the left
arrow is the decrement arrow. For right- to-left layouts,
the right arrow is the decrement arrow and the left arrow is
the increment arrow.</p>

<p>For a numeric type child, the increment arrow increases
the displayed value by the incremental value up to the
maximum. The decrement arrow decreases the displayed value
by the given incremental value down to the minimum.</p>

<p>The increment arrow for a string type child moves toward
the last entry of the array of compound strings (by
increasing the SpinBox constraint resource XmNposition). The
decrement arrow moves toward the first entry of the compound
string array.</p>

<p>The programmer can also control the sensitivity of each
arrow in the SpinBox. Sensitive arrows spin choices;
insensitive arrows do not spin choices. Arrow sensitivity is
set for the SpinBox widget by using the
XmNdefaultArrowSensitivity resource, but it can be modified
on a per child basis by using the XmNarrowSensitivity
constraint resource.</p>

<p>SpinBox provides two callbacks to application
programmers. (In addi- tion, the callbacks of the SpinBox s
children may be invoked.) Each of these callbacks receives a
pointer to XmSpinBoxCallbackStruct. The
XmNmodifyVerifyCallback procedures are called before a new
choice is displayed. The XmNvalueChangedCallback procedures
are called after a new choice is displayed.</p>

<p>XmNmodifyVerifyCallback tells the application what the
new position will be in the ring of choices. This callback
can be used to make the SpinBox stop at the upper and lower
limits or go to a different, non- consecutive choice. The
application allows the change in position by leaving the
doit member set to True. The application can spin to a
position other than the next consecutive position by leaving
doit set to True and by changing the position member to the
desired position. When doit is set to False by an
application, there is no change in the choice displayed.</p>

<p>After a new choice is displayed, the
XmNvalueChangedCallback procedure is called. The application
can use this procedure to perform tasks when specific values
are reached or when boundaries are crossed. For exam- ple,
if the user spins from January back to December, the
application could change to the previous year. If the user
spins from December to January, the application could change
to the next year.</p>

<p>SpinBox dimensions can be set using the Core resources
XmNheight and XmNwidth. If dimensions are not specified, the
SpinBox size is deter- mined by the sizes of its arrows and
children. The SpinBox will attempt to grow so that the
arrows and all children are visible.</p>

<p>SpinBox uses the XmQTaccessTextual trait and holds the
XmQTnavigator trait.</p>

<p>Classes SpinBox inherits behavior, resources, and traits
from the Core, Compos- ite, Constraint, and XmManager
classes.</p>

<p>The class pointer is xmSpinBoxWidgetClass.</p>

<p>The class name is XmSpinBox.</p>

<p>New Resources The following table defines a set of
widget resources used by the pro- grammer to specify data.
The programmer can also set the resource val- ues for the
inherited classes to set attributes for this widget. To
reference a resource by name or by class in a .Xdefaults
file, remove the XmN or XmC prefix and use the remaining
letters. To specify one of the defined values for a resource
in a .Xdefaults file, remove the Xm prefix and use the
remaining letters (in either lowercase or uppercase, but
include any underscores between words). The codes in the
access column indicate whether the given resource can be set
at creation time (C), set by using XtSetValues (S),
retrieved by using XtGetValues (G), or is not applicable
(N/A).</p>

<p>XmNarrowLayout Specifies placement of the two arrows in
the widget. Possible layouts are as follows:</p>

<p>XmARROWS_BEGINNING Places left and right arrows beside
each other, before the child(ren). Positioning for this
layout is dependent on the VendorShell resource XmNlayout-
Direction.</p>

<p>XmARROWS_END Places left and right arrows beside each
other, after the child(ren). Positioning for this layout is
dependent on the VendorShell resource XmNlayout-
Direction.</p>

<p>XmARROWS_FLAT_BEGINNING Places a pair of arrows side by
side before the XmSpinBox children. Positioning for this
layout is dependent on the VendorShell resource XmNlayoutDi-
rection.</p>

<p>XmARROWS_FLAT_END Places a pair of arrows side by side
after the XmSpinBox children. Positioning for this layout is
dependent on the VendorShell resource XmNlayoutDi-
rection.</p>

<p>XmARROWS_SPLIT Places a left arrow on the left side and
a right arrow on the right side of the child(ren).</p>

<p>XmNarrowSize Specifies both the width and height of the
arrow in pixels.</p>

<p>XmNdefaultArrowSensitivity Specifies the default
sensitivity of the arrows in the wid- get. Insensitive
arrows change color, cannot be depressed, and perform no
action. (This resource may be overridden by the constraint
resource XmNarrowSensitivity for individual traversable text
children of the SpinBox.) Possible default sensitivity
values are as follows:</p>

<p>XmARROWS_SENSITIVE Both arrows are sensitive.</p>

<p>XmARROWS_DECREMENT_SENSITIVE Only the decrement arrow
(as determined by XmNlay- outDirection) is sensitive. The
increment arrow is insensitive.</p>

<p>XmARROWS_INCREMENT_SENSITIVE Only the increment arrow
(as determined by XmNlay- outDirection) is sensitive. The
decrement arrow is insensitive.</p>

<p>XmARROWS_INSENSITIVE Both arrows are insensitive.</p>

<p>XmNdetailShadowThickness Specifies the thickness of the
inside arrow shadows. The default thickness is 2 pixels.</p>

<p>XmNinitialDelay Specifies how long, in milliseconds, the
mouse button must be held down before automatic spinning
begins. In other words, when the user selects the increment
or decrement arrow and keeps it depressed, this delay occurs
before the choices start spinning. If XmNinitialDelay is 0,
then XmNrepeatDelay is used as the initial delay.</p>

<p>XmNmarginHeight Specifies the amount of blank space
between the top edge of the SpinBox widget and the first
item in each column, and the bottom edge of the SpinBox
widget and the last item in each column.</p>

<p>XmNmarginWidth Specifies the amount of blank space
between the left edge of the SpinBox widget and the first
item in each row, and the right edge of the SpinBox widget
and the last item in each row.</p>

<p>XmNmodifyVerifyCallback This callback is called before
the SpinBox position changes (see the Constraint resource
XmNposition). The application can use this callback to set
the next position, change Spin- Box resources, or cancel the
impending action. For example, this callback can be used to
stop the spinning just before wrapping at the upper and
lower position boundaries. If the doit member is set to
False, nothing happens. Otherwise the position changes.
Reasons sent by the callback are XmCR_SPIN_NEXT,
XmCR_SPIN_PRIOR, XmCR_SPIN_FIRST, or XmCR_SPIN_LAST.</p>

<p>XmNrepeatDelay When the user selects and keeps an arrow
button depressed by pressing and holding &lt;Btn1&gt;,
spinning begins. After the time specified in XmNinitialDelay
elapses, the SpinBox position changes automatically until
the arrow button is released. The XmNrepeatDelay resource
specifies the delay in millisec- onds between each automatic
change. If XmNrepeatDelay is set to 0 (zero), automatic
spinning is turned off and XmNini- tialDelay is ignored.</p>

<p>XmNspacing Specifies the horizontal and vertical spacing
between items contained within the SpinBox widget.</p>

<p>XmNvalueChangedCallback This is called n+1 times for n
SpinBox position changes (see the Constraint resource
XmNposition). Reasons sent by the callback are XmCR_OK,
XmCR_SPIN_NEXT, XmCR_SPIN_PRIOR, XmCR_SPIN_FIRST, or
XmCR_SPIN_LAST. Other members are detailed in the callback
structure description.</p>

<p>XmNarrowSensitivity Specifies the sensitivity of the
arrows for a SpinBox child. By using this resource in the
definition of a SpinBox child, the application programmer
can override the default SpinBox sensitivity (set by
XmNdefaultArrowSensitivity) for a partic- ular child. This
allows each traversable child to have a dif- ferent arrow
sensitivity. The arrow sensitivity values are as
follows:</p>

<p>XmARROWS_SENSITIVE Both arrows are sensitive.</p>

<p>XmARROWS_DECREMENT_SENSITIVE Only the decrement arrow
(as determined by XmNlay- outDirection) is sensitive.</p>

<p>XmARROWS_INCREMENT_SENSITIVE Only the increment arrow
(as determined by XmNlay- outDirection) is sensitive.</p>

<p>XmARROWS_INSENSITIVE Both arrows are insensitive.</p>

<p>XmARROWS_DEFAULT_SENSITIVITY Use the sensitivity
specified in the XmNdefaultAr- rowSensitivity resource.</p>

<p>XmNdecimalPoints Specifies the number of decimal places
used when displaying the value of a SpinBox numeric type
child. If the number of decimal places specified is greater
than the number of digits in a displayed value, the value is
padded with 0 (zeros). For example, when XmNinitialValue is
1 and XmNmaximumValue is 1000 and XmNdecimalPoints is 3, the
range of values displayed in the SpinBox is 0.001 to 1.000.
This is used only when XmN- spinBoxChildType is
XmNUMERIC.</p>

<p>XmNincrementValue Specifies the amount by which to
increment or decrement a SpinBox numeric type child. This is
used only when XmNspin- BoxChildType is XmNUMERIC.</p>

<p>XmNmaximumValue Specifies the highest possible value for
a numeric SpinBox. This is used only when
XmNspinBoxChildType is XmNUMERIC.</p>

<p>XmNminimumValue Specifies the lowest possible value for
a numeric SpinBox. This is used only when
XmNspinBoxChildType is XmNUMERIC.</p>

<p>XmNnumValues Specifies the number of strings in
XmNvalues. The application must change this value when
strings are added or removed from XmNvalues. This is used
only when XmNspinBoxChildType is XmSTRING.</p>

<p>XmNposition Specifies the position of the currently
displayed item. The interpritation of XmNposition is
dependent upon the value of the XmNpositionType
resource.</p>

<p>When XmNpositionType is XmPOSITION_INDEX the XmNposition
value is interpreted as follows: For XmSpinBox children of
type XmNUMERIC, the XmNposition resource is interpreted as
an index into an array of items. The minimum allowable value
for XmNposition is 0. The maximum allowable value for
XmNposition is
(XmNmaximumValue-XmNminimumValue)/XmNincrementValue. The
value display by the XmSpinBox child is
XmNminimumValue+(XmN- position*XmNincrementValue). For
XmSpinBox children of type XmSTRING, the XmNposition
resource is interpreted as an index into an array of
XmNnumValues items. The minimum allowable value for
XmNposition is 0. The maximum allowable value for
XmNposition is XmNnumValues - 1. The value displayed by the
XmSpinBox is the XmNposition th value in the XmNvalues
array.</p>

<p>When XmNpositionType is XmPOSITION_VALUE the XmNposition
value is interpreted as follows:</p>

<p>For XmSpinBox children of type XmNUMERIC, the
XmNposition resource is interpreted as the actual value to
be displayed. The minimum allowable value for XmNposition is
XmNminimum- Value. The maximum allowable value for
XmNposition is XmNmax- imumValue. The value displayed by the
XmSpinBox child is XmNposition. For XmSpinBox children of
type XmSTRING, the interpretation is the same for
XmPOSITION_VALUE as for XmPO- SITION_INDEX.</p>

<p>Position values falling outside the specified range are
invalid. When an application assigns a value to XmNposition
which is less than the minimum, XmNposition is set to the
minimum and an error message is displayed. When an applica-
tion assigns a value to XmNposition which is greater than
the maximum, XmNposition is set to the maximum and an error
mes- sage is displayed.</p>

<p>XmNpositionType Specifies how values the XmNposition
resource are to be interpreted. Valid values include
XmPOSITION_INDEX and XmPO- SITION_VALUE.</p>

<p>XmNspinBoxChildType Specifies the type of data displayed
in the child:</p>

<p>XmNUMERIC The SpinBox choice range is defined by numeric
min- imum, maximum, and incremental values.</p>

<p>XmSTRING The SpinBox choices are alphanumeric.</p>

<p>XmNvalues Specifies the array of XmStrings to be
displayed in a SpinBox string type child. The application
must change XmNnumValues when strings are added to or
removed from XmNvalues. This is used only when
XmNspinBoxChildType is XmSTRING.</p>

<p>Callback A pointer to the following structure is passed
to each callback:</p>

<p>typedef struct { int reason; XEvent * event; Widget
widget; Boolean doit; int position; XmString value; Boolean
crossed_boundary; } XmSpinBoxCallbackStruct;</p>

<p>reason Indicates why the callback was invoked. Reasons
may be the following:</p>

<p>XmCR_OK Spinning has stopped because the SpinBox arrow
has been disarmed. XmCR_OK is either the last or only
call.</p>

<p>XmCR_SPIN_NEXT The increment arrow has been armed and
position is increasing. Further callbacks will come. For a
numeric type child, the values displayed are approaching the
maximum. For a string SpinBox, the values displayed are
approaching the last entry in the array of XmString s.</p>

<p>XmCR_SPIN_PRIOR The decrement arrow has been armed and
position is decreasing. Further callbacks will come. For a
numeric type child, the values displayed are approaching the
minimum. For a string type child, the values displayed are
approaching the first entry in the array of XmStrings.</p>

<p>XmCR_SPIN_FIRST The begin data (&lt;osfBeginData&gt;)
key sequence has been pressed. The SpinBox is at its first
position, displaying the lowest value or the first entry in
the array of XmStrings.</p>

<p>XmCR_SPIN_LAST The end data (&lt;osfEndData&gt;) key
sequence has been pressed. The SpinBox is at its last
position, dis- playing the highest value or the last entry
in the array of XmStrings.</p>

<p>event Points to the XEvent that triggered this
callback.</p>

<p>widget Specifies the child widget affected by this
callback.</p>

<p>doit When the callback is XmNmodifyVerifyCallback, doit
indicates whether or not an action will be performed before
the SpinBox position changes. If the callback leaves doit
set to True (the default), the spinning action is performed.
If the call- back sets doit to False, the spinning action is
not per- formed. When the callback is
XmNvalueChangedCallback, doit is ignored.</p>

<p>position Specifies the next value of the SpinBox
position (same as XmNposition). This is an output field for
the XmNmodifyVeri- fyCallback, which may change the next
position as dictated by the needs of an application.</p>

<p>value Specifies the new XmString value in the text child
widget. The user program must copy this string if it is to
be used outside the callback routine.</p>

<p>crossed_boundary Specifies whether or not the SpinBox
has crossed the upper or lower boundary (the last or first
compound string, or the maximum or minimum value). The
crossed_boundary value is True if the SpinBox has just
crossed a boundary, and False if it has not.</p>

<p>Translations The XmSpinBox translations are as
follows:</p>

<p>The following key names are listed in the X standard key
event transla- tion table syntax. This format is the one
used by Motif to specify the widget actions corresponding to
a given key. A brief overview of the format is provided
under VirtualBindings(3). For a complete description of the
format, please refer to the X Toolkit Instrinsics
Documentation.</p>

<p>Accelerators The XmNaccelerators resource of a SpinBox
are added to each traversable text child. The default
XmNaccelerators are defined in the following list. The
bindings for &lt;Key&gt;&lt;osfUp&gt; and
&lt;Key&gt;&lt;osfDown&gt; cannot be changed.</p>

<p>&lt;Key&gt; &lt;osfBeginData&gt;: SpinBFirst()</p>

<p>&lt;Key&gt; &lt;osfEndData&gt;: SpinBLast()</p>

<p>Action Routines The XmSpinBox action routines are as
follows:</p>

<p>SpinBArm(): Visually arms the SpinBox by drawing the
armed arrow so that it appears to be depressed. This action
is initiated when the user presses &lt;Btn1&gt; while the
pointer is within the bound- aries of either the increment
or decrement arrow. The arrow remains visually armed as long
as &lt;Btn1&gt; remains depressed.</p>

<p>If the time period specified by XmNrepeatDelay is not
greater than zero milliseconds, nothing else happens while
&lt;Btn1&gt; remains depressed.</p>

<p>If the time period specified by XmNrepeatDelay is
greater than zero milliseconds, and the arrow is disarmed
before the time period specified by XmNinitialDelay has
elapsed, nothing else happens in this action.</p>

<p>If the time period specified by XmNrepeatDelay is
greater than zero milliseconds, and the arrow is still armed
after the time period specified by XmNinitialDelay has
elapsed, the following occurs:</p>

<p>&middot; The reason member of the SpinBox callback
structure, XmSpinBoxCallbackStruct, is set to XmCR_SPIN_NEXT
if the increment arrow is armed, or to XmCR_SPIN_PRIOR if
the decrement arrow is armed.</p>

<p>&middot; The position member is set to the next
position.</p>

<p>&middot; The doit member is set to True.</p>

<p>&middot; XmNmodifyVerifyCallback, if it exists, is
invoked. The application may change the value of position
and doit. If the application sets doit to False, nothing
else happens until the XmNrepeatDelay period has elapsed, or
until &lt;Btn1&gt; is released.</p>

<p>If doit remains set to True, the following occurs:</p>

<p>&middot; The value of XmNposition is changed to the
value of position in the SpinBox callback structure.</p>

<p>&middot; The text corresponding to the new position is
displayed in the traversable text child that currently has
focus.</p>

<p>&middot; The reason member of the SpinBox callback
structure is set to XmCR_SPIN_NEXT if the increment arrow is
armed, or XmCR_SPIN_PRIOR if the decrement arrow is
armed.</p>

<p>&middot; The position member is set to the current (new)
value of XmNposition.</p>

<p>&middot; XmNvalueChangedCallback, if it exists, is
called. Spin- Box ignores any changes to position or doit
members made by XmNvalueChangedCallback.</p>

<p>These events are repeated each time the XmNrepeatDelay
period elapses and the arrow remains armed.</p>

<p>SpinBDisarm(): Visually disarms the SpinBox by drawing
the previously armed arrow so that it no longer appears to
be depressed.</p>

<p>If the time period specified by XmNrepeatDelay is not
greater than zero milliseconds, or the time period specified
by XmNinitialDelay has not elapsed, the following then
occurs:</p>

<p>&middot; The reason member of the SpinBox callback
structure, XmSpinBoxCallbackStruct, is set to XmCR_SPIN_NEXT
if the increment arrow is armed, or to XmCR_SPIN_PRIOR if
the decrement arrow is armed.</p>

<p>&middot; The position member is set to the next
position.</p>

<p>&middot; The doit member is set to True.</p>

<p>&middot; The XmNmodifyVerifyCallback, if there is one,
is invoked. The application may change the value of position
and doit. If the application sets doit to False, nothing
else happens until the XmNrepeatDelay period has elapsed, or
until &lt;Btn1&gt; is released.</p>

<p>If doit remains set to True, the following occurs:</p>

<p>&middot; The value of XmNposition is changed to the
value of position in the SpinBox callback structure.</p>

<p>&middot; The text corresponding to the new position is
displayed in the traversable text child that currently has
focus.</p>

<p>&middot; The reason member of the SpinBox callback
structure is set to XmCR_SPIN_NEXT if the increment arrow is
armed, or XmCR_SPIN_PRIOR if the decrement arrow is
armed.</p>

<p>&middot; The position member is set to the current (new)
value of XmNposition.</p>

<p>&middot; XmNvalueChangedCallback, if it exists, is
called. Spin- Box ignores any changes to position or doit
members made by an XmNvalueChangedCallback.</p>

<p>If an XmNvalueChangedCallback procedure is issued after
the button has been armed, regardless of the value of
XmNrepeat- Delay or whether the XmNinitialDelay has
expired:</p>

<p>&middot; The reason member of the SpinBox callback
structure is set to XmCR_OK.</p>

<p>&middot; The position member is set to the current value
of XmN- position.</p>

<p>&middot; XmNvalueChangedCallback, if it exists, is
called.</p>

<p>SpinBFirst(): The following occurs:</p>

<p>&middot; The reason member of the SpinBox callback
structure, XmSpinBoxCallbackStruct, is set to
XmCR_SPIN_FIRST.</p>

<p>&middot; The position member is set to the first (0)
position.</p>

<p>&middot; The doit member is set to True.</p>

<p>&middot; XmNmodifyVerifyCallback, if it exists, is
invoked. The application may change the value of position
and doit. If the application sets doit to False, nothing
else happens until the XmNrepeatDelay period has elapsed, or
until &lt;Btn1&gt; is released.</p>

<p>If doit remains set to True, the following occurs:</p>

<p>&middot; The value of XmNposition is changed to the
value of position in the SpinBox callback structure.</p>

<p>&middot; The text corresponding to the new position is
displayed in the traversable text child that currently has
