<p>NAME ypserv - NIS server</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS /usr/sbin/ypserv [ -d [ path ] ] [ -p port ] [
-i iface ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The Network Information Service (NIS)
provides a simple network lookup service consisting of
databases and processes. The databases are gdbm files in a
directory tree rooted at /var/yp.</p>

<p>The ypserv daemon is typically activated at system
startup. ypserv runs only on NIS server machines with a
complete NIS database. On other machines using the NIS
services, you have to run ypbind as client or under Linux
you could use the libc with NYS support. ypbind must run on
every machine which has NIS client processes; ypserv may or
may not be running on the same node, but must be running
somewhere on the net- work. On startup or when receiving the
signal SIGHUP, ypserv parses the file /etc/ypserv.conf.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -d --debug [path] Causes the server to run in
debugging mode. Normally, ypserv reports only errors (access
violations, dbm failures) using the syslog(3) facility. In
debug mode, the server does not back- ground itself and
prints extra status messages to stderr for each request that
it receives. path is an optionally parameter. ypserv is
using this directory instead of /var/yp</p>

<p>-i --iface iface Causes the server to only be available
via interface iface Use this if you want ypserv to only
provide service on a particular network interface. iface is
a required parameter ypserv will be using that interface
instead of all the available network inter- faces.</p>

<p>-p --port port ypserv will bind itself to this port.
This makes it possible to have a router filter packets to
the NIS ports, so that access to the NIS server from hosts
on the Internet can be restricted.</p>

<p>-v --version Prints the version number</p>

<p>SECURITY In general, any remote user can issue an RPC to
ypserv and retrieve the contents of your NIS maps, if he
knows your domain name. To prevent such unauthorized
transactions, ypserv supports a feature called securenets
which can be used to restrict access to a given set of
hosts. At startup or when arriving the SIGHUP Signal, ypserv
will attempt to load the securenets information from a file
called /var/yp/securenets . This file contains entries that
consist of a net- mask and a network pair separated by white
spaces. Lines starting with # are considered to be
comments.</p>

<p>A sample securenets file might look like this:</p>

<p># allow connections from local host -- necessary host
127.0.0.1 # same as 255.255.255.255 127.0.0.1 # # allow
connections from any host # on the 131.234.223.0 network
255.255.255.0 131.234.223.0 # allow connections from any
host # between 131.234.214.0 and 131.234.215.255
255.255.254.0 131.234.214.0</p>

<p>If ypserv receives a request from an address that fails
to match a rule, the request will be ignored and a warning
message will be logged. If the /var/yp/securenets file does
not exist, ypserv will allow con- nections from any
host.</p>

<p>In the /etc/ypserv.conf you could specify some access
rules for special maps and hosts. But it is not very secure,
it makes the life only a little bit harder for a potential
hacker. If a mapname doesnt match a rule, ypserv will look
for the YP_SECURE key in the map. If it exists, ypserv will
only allow requests on a reserved port.</p>

<p>For security reasons, ypserv will only accept ypproc_xfr
requests for updating maps from the same master server as
the old one. This means, you have to reinstall the slave
servers if you change the master server for a map.</p>

<p>The Network Information Service (NIS) was formerly known
as Sun Yellow Pages (YP). The functionality of the two
remains the same; only the name has changed. The name Yellow
