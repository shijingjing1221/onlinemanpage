<p>TIMEOUT(1) User Commands TIMEOUT(1)</p>

<p>NAME timeout - run a command with a time limit</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS timeout [OPTION] NUMBER[SUFFIX] COMMAND
[ARG]... timeout [OPTION]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Start COMMAND, and kill it if still running
after NUMBER seconds. SUF- FIX may be s for seconds (the
default), m for minutes, h for hours or d for days.</p>

<p>Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for
short options too.</p>

<p>-s, --signal=SIGNAL</p>

<p>specify the signal to be sent on timeout. SIGNAL may be
a name like HUP or a number. See kill -l for a list of
signals</p>

<p>--help display this help and exit</p>

<p>--version output version information and exit</p>

<p>If the command times out, then exit with status 124.
Otherwise, exit with the status of COMMAND. If no signal is
specified, send the TERM signal upon timeout. The TERM
signal kills any process that does not block or catch that
signal. For other processes, it may be necessary to use the
KILL (9) signal, since this signal cannot be caught.</p>
