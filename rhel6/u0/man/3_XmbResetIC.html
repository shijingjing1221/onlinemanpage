<p>XmbResetIC(3) XLIB FUNCTIONS XmbResetIC(3)</p>

<p>NAME XmbResetIC, XwcResetIC, Xutf8ResetIC - reset the
state of an input con- text</p>

<p>SYNTAX char *XmbResetIC(XIC ic);</p>

<p>wchar_t *XwcResetIC(XIC ic);</p>

<p>char *Xutf8ResetIC(XIC ic);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS ic Specifies the input context.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION When XNResetState is set to XIMInitialState,
XmbResetIC, XwcResetIC and Xutf8ResetIC reset an input
context to its initial state; when XNReset- State is set to
XIMPreserveState, the current input context state is
preserved. In both cases, any input pending on that context
is deleted. The input method is required to clear the
preedit area, if any, and update the status accordingly.
Calling XmbResetIC, XwcResetIC or Xutf8ResetIC does not
change the focus.</p>

<p>The return value of XmbResetIC is its current preedit
string as a multibyte string. The return value of XwcResetIC
is its current preedit string as a wide character string.
The return value of Xutf8ResetIC is its current preedit
string as an UTF-8 string. If there is any preedit text
drawn or visible to the user, then these pro- cedures must
return a non-NULL string. If there is no visible preedit
text, then it is input method implementation-dependent
whether these procedures return a non-NULL string or
NULL.</p>

<p>The client should free the returned string by calling
XFree.</p>

<p>The function Xutf8ResetIC is an extension introduced by
The XFree86 Project, Inc. in their 4.0.2 release. Its
presence is indicated by the macro X_HAVE_UTF8_STRING.</p>
