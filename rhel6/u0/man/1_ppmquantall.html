<p>NAME ppmquantall - run Pnmquant on a bunch of files all
at once, so they share a common colormap</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ppmquantall</p>

<p>[-ext extension] ncolors ppmfile...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>ppmquantall takes a bunch of PPM images as input,
chooses ncolors col- ors to best represent all of the
images, maps the existing colors to the new ones, and
overwrites the input files with the new quantized
versions.</p>

<p>If you dont want to overwrite your input files, use the
-ext option. The output files are then named the same as the
input files, plus a period and the extension text you
specify.</p>

<p>Verbose explanation: Lets say youve got a dozen PPMs
that you want to display on the screen all at the same time.
Your screen can only dis- play 256 different colors, but the
PPMs have a total of a thousand or so different colors. For
a single PPM you solve this problem with pnmquant;
ppmquantall solves it for multiple PPMs. All it does is con-
catenate them together into one big PPM, run pnmquant on
that, and then split it up into little PPMs again.</p>

<p>(Note that another way to solve this problem is to
pre-select a set of colors and then use pnmremap to
separately quantize each PPM to that set.)</p>
