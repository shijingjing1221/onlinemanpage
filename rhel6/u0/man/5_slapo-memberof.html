<p>NAME slapo-memberof - Reverse Group Membership overlay
to slapd</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS /etc/openldap/slapd.conf</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The memberof overlay to slapd(8) allows
automatic reverse group member- ship maintenance. Any time a
group entry is modified, its members are modified as
appropriate in order to keep a DN-valued &quot;is member
of&quot; attribute updated with the DN of the group.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION The config directives that are specific to
the memberof overlay must be prefixed by memberof-, to avoid
potential conflicts with directives specific to the
underlying database or to other stacked overlays.</p>

<p>overlay memberof This directive adds the memberof
overlay to the current database; see slapd.conf(5) for
details.</p>

<p>The following slapd.conf configuration options are
defined for the mem- berofoverlay.</p>

<p>memberof-group-oc &lt;group-oc&gt; The value
&lt;group-oc&gt; is the name of the objectClass that trig-
gers the reverse group membership update. It defaults to
groupOfNames.</p>

<p>memberof-member-ad &lt;member-ad&gt; The value
&lt;member-ad&gt; is the name of the attribute that contains
the names of the members in the group objects; it must be
DN- valued. It defaults to member.</p>

<p>memberof-memberof-ad &lt;memberof-ad&gt; The value
&lt;memberof-ad&gt; is the name of the attribute that con-
tains the names of the groups an entry is member of; it must
be DN-valued. Its contents are automatically updated by the
over- lay. It defaults to memberOf.</p>

<p>memberof-dn &lt;dn&gt; The value &lt;dn&gt; contains the
DN that is used as modifiersName for internal modifications
performed to update the reverse group membership. It
defaults to the rootdn of the underlying database.</p>

<p>memberof-dangling {ignore, drop, error} This option
determines the behavior of the overlay when, during a
modification, it encounters dangling references. The default
is ignore, which may leave dangling references. Other
options are drop, which discards those modifications that
would result in dangling references, and error, which causes
modifications that would result in dangling references to
fail.</p>

<p>memberof-dangling-error &lt;error-code&gt; If
memberof-dangling is set to error, this configuration
parame- ter can be used to modify the response code returned
in case of violation. It defaults to &quot;constraint
violation&quot;, but other implementations are known to
return &quot;no such object&quot; instead.</p>

<p>memberof-refint {true|FALSE} This option determines
whether the overlay will try to preserve referential
integrity or not. If set to TRUE, when an entry containing
values of the &quot;is member of&quot; attribute is
modified, the corresponding groups are modified as well.</p>

<p>The memberof overlay may be used with any backend that
provides full read-write functionality, but it is mainly
intended for use with local storage backends.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/openldap/slapd.conf default slapd
configuration file</p>

<p>SEE ALSO slapd.conf(5), slapd-config(5), slapd(8). The
slapo-memberof(5) over- lay supports dynamic configuration
via back-config.</p>
