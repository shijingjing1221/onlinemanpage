<p>Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
feature_test_macros(7)):</p>

<p>cfsetspeed(), cfmakeraw(): _BSD_SOURCE</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The termios functions describe a general
terminal interface that is provided to control asynchronous
communications ports.</p>

<p>The termios structure Many of the functions described
here have a termios_p argument that is a pointer to a
termios structure. This structure contains at least the
following members:</p>

<p>tcflag_t c_iflag; /* input modes */ tcflag_t c_oflag; /*
output modes */ tcflag_t c_cflag; /* control modes */
tcflag_t c_lflag; /* local modes */ cc_t c_cc[NCCS]; /*
control chars */</p>

<p>The values that may be assigned to these fields are
described below. In the case of the first four bit-mask
fields, the definitions of some of the associated flags that
may be set are only exposed if a specific feature test macro
(see feature_test_macros(7)) is defined, as noted in
brackets (&quot;[]&quot;).</p>

<p>In the descriptions below, &quot;not in POSIX&quot;
means that the value is not specified in POSIX.1-2001, and
&quot;XSI&quot; means that the value is specified in
POSIX.1-2001 as part of the XSI extension.</p>

<p>c_iflag flag constants:</p>

<p>IGNBRK Ignore BREAK condition on input.</p>

<p>BRKINT If IGNBRK is set, a BREAK is ignored. If it is
not set but BRKINT is set, then a BREAK causes the input and
output queues to be flushed, and if the terminal is the
controlling terminal of a foreground process group, it will
cause a SIGINT to be sent to this foreground process group.
When neither IGNBRK nor BRKINT are set, a BREAK reads as a
null byte (&rsquo; &rsquo;), except when PARMRK is set, in
which case it reads as the sequence 377 .</p>

<p>IGNPAR Ignore framing errors and parity errors.</p>

<p>PARMRK If IGNPAR is not set, prefix a character with a
parity error or framing error with 377 . If neither IGNPAR
nor PARMRK is set, read a character with a parity error or
framing error as .</p>

<p>INPCK Enable input parity checking.</p>

<p>ISTRIP Strip off eighth bit.</p>

<p>INLCR Translate NL to CR on input.</p>

<p>IGNCR Ignore carriage return on input.</p>

<p>ICRNL Translate carriage return to newline on input
(unless IGNCR is set).</p>

<p>IUCLC (not in POSIX) Map uppercase characters to
lowercase on input.</p>

<p>IXON Enable XON/XOFF flow control on output.</p>

<p>IXANY (XSI) Typing any character will restart stopped
output. (The default is to allow just the START character to
restart output.)</p>

<p>IXOFF Enable XON/XOFF flow control on input.</p>

<p>IMAXBEL (not in POSIX) Ring bell when input queue is
full. Linux does not implement this bit, and acts as if it
is always set.</p>

<p>IUTF8 (since Linux 2.6.4) (not in POSIX) Input is UTF8;
this allows character-erase to be correctly performed in
cooked mode.</p>

<p>c_oflag flag constants defined in POSIX.1:</p>

<p>OPOST Enable implementation-defined output
processing.</p>

<p>The remaining c_oflag flag constants are defined in
POSIX.1-2001, unless marked otherwise.</p>

<p>OLCUC (not in POSIX) Map lowercase characters to
uppercase on output.</p>

<p>ONLCR (XSI) Map NL to CR-NL on output.</p>

<p>OCRNL Map CR to NL on output.</p>

<p>ONOCR Dont output CR at column 0.</p>

<p>ONLRET Dont output CR.</p>

<p>OFILL Send fill characters for a delay, rather than
using a timed delay.</p>

<p>OFDEL (not in POSIX) Fill character is ASCII DEL (0177).
If unset, fill character is ASCII NUL (&rsquo; &rsquo;).
(Not implemented on Linux.)</p>

<p>NLDLY Newline delay mask. Values are NL0 and NL1.
[requires _BSD_SOURCE or _SVID_SOURCE or _XOPEN_SOURCE]</p>

<p>CRDLY Carriage return delay mask. Values are CR0, CR1,
CR2, or CR3. [requires _BSD_SOURCE or _SVID_SOURCE or
_XOPEN_SOURCE]</p>

<p>TABDLY Horizontal tab delay mask. Values are TAB0, TAB1,
TAB2, TAB3 (or XTABS). A value of TAB3, that is, XTABS,
expands tabs to spaces (with tab stops every eight columns).
[requires _BSD_SOURCE or _SVID_SOURCE or _XOPEN_SOURCE]</p>

<p>BSDLY Backspace delay mask. Values are BS0 or BS1. (Has
never been implemented.) [requires _BSD_SOURCE or
_SVID_SOURCE or _XOPEN_SOURCE]</p>

<p>VTDLY Vertical tab delay mask. Values are VT0 or
VT1.</p>

<p>FFDLY Form feed delay mask. Values are FF0 or FF1.
[requires _BSD_SOURCE or _SVID_SOURCE or _XOPEN_SOURCE]</p>

<p>c_cflag flag constants:</p>

<p>CBAUD (not in POSIX) Baud speed mask (4+1 bits).
[requires _BSD_SOURCE or _SVID_SOURCE]</p>

<p>CBAUDEX (not in POSIX) Extra baud speed mask (1 bit),
included in CBAUD. [requires _BSD_SOURCE or
_SVID_SOURCE]</p>

<p>(POSIX says that the baud speed is stored in the termios
struc- ture without specifying where precisely, and provides
cfgetispeed() and cfsetispeed() for getting at it. Some
systems use bits selected by CBAUD in c_cflag, other systems
use sepa- rate fields, for example, sg_ispeed and
sg_ospeed.)</p>

<p>CSIZE Character size mask. Values are CS5, CS6, CS7, or
CS8.</p>

<p>CSTOPB Set two stop bits, rather than one.</p>

<p>CREAD Enable receiver.</p>

<p>PARENB Enable parity generation on output and parity
checking for input.</p>

<p>PARODD If set, then parity for input and output is odd;
otherwise even parity is used.</p>

<p>HUPCL Lower modem control lines after last process
closes the device (hang up).</p>

<p>CLOCAL Ignore modem control lines.</p>

<p>LOBLK (not in POSIX) Block output from a non-current
shell layer. For use by shl (shell layers). (Not implemented
on Linux.)</p>

<p>CIBAUD (not in POSIX) Mask for input speeds. The values
for the CIBAUD bits are the same as the values for the CBAUD
bits, shifted left IBSHIFT bits. [requires _BSD_SOURCE or
_SVID_SOURCE] (Not implemented on Linux.)</p>

<p>CMSPAR (not in POSIX) Use &quot;stick&quot; (mark/space)
parity (supported on certain serial devices): if PARODD is
set, the parity bit is always 1; if PARODD is not set, then
the parity bit is always 0). [requires _BSD_SOURCE or
_SVID_SOURCE]</p>

<p>CRTSCTS (not in POSIX) Enable RTS/CTS (hardware) flow
control. [requires _BSD_SOURCE or _SVID_SOURCE]</p>

<p>c_lflag flag constants:</p>

<p>ISIG When any of the characters INTR, QUIT, SUSP, or
DSUSP are received, generate the corresponding signal.</p>

<p>ICANON Enable canonical mode (described below).</p>

<p>XCASE (not in POSIX; not supported under Linux) If
ICANON is also set, terminal is uppercase only. Input is
converted to lowercase, except for characters preceded by .
On output, uppercase char- acters are preceded by and
lowercase characters are converted to uppercase. [requires
_BSD_SOURCE or _SVID_SOURCE or _XOPEN_SOURCE]</p>

<p>ECHO Echo input characters.</p>

<p>ECHOE If ICANON is also set, the ERASE character erases
the preceding input character, and WERASE erases the
preceding word.</p>

<p>ECHOK If ICANON is also set, the KILL character erases
the current line.</p>

<p>ECHONL If ICANON is also set, echo the NL character even
if ECHO is not set.</p>

<p>ECHOCTL (not in POSIX) If ECHO is also set, ASCII
control signals other than TAB, NL, START, and STOP are
echoed as ^X, where X is the character with ASCII code 0x40
greater than the control signal. For example, character 0x08
(BS) is echoed as ^H. [requires _BSD_SOURCE or
_SVID_SOURCE]</p>

<p>ECHOPRT (not in POSIX) If ICANON and IECHO are also set,
characters are printed as they are being erased. [requires
_BSD_SOURCE or _SVID_SOURCE]</p>

<p>ECHOKE (not in POSIX) If ICANON is also set, KILL is
echoed by erasing each character on the line, as specified
by ECHOE and ECHOPRT. [requires _BSD_SOURCE or
_SVID_SOURCE]</p>

<p>DEFECHO (not in POSIX) Echo only when a process is
reading. (Not imple- mented on Linux.)</p>

<p>FLUSHO (not in POSIX; not supported under Linux) Output
is being flushed. This flag is toggled by typing the DISCARD
character. [requires _BSD_SOURCE or _SVID_SOURCE]</p>

<p>NOFLSH Disable flushing the input and output queues when
generating the SIGINT, SIGQUIT, and SIGSUSP signals.</p>

<p>TOSTOP Send the SIGTTOU signal to the process group of a
background process which tries to write to its controlling
terminal.</p>

<p>PENDIN (not in POSIX; not supported under Linux) All
characters in the input queue are reprinted when the next
character is read. (bash(1) handles typeahead this way.)
[requires _BSD_SOURCE or _SVID_SOURCE]</p>

<p>IEXTEN Enable implementation-defined input processing.
This flag, as well as ICANON must be enabled for the special
characters EOL2, LNEXT, REPRINT, WERASE to be interpreted,
and for the IUCLC flag to be effective.</p>

<p>The c_cc array defines the special control characters.
The symbolic indices (initial values) and meaning are:</p>

<p>VINTR (003, ETX, Ctrl-C, or also 0177, DEL, rubout)
Interrupt charac- ter. Send a SIGINT signal. Recognized when
ISIG is set, and then not passed as input.</p>

<p>VQUIT (034, FS, Ctrl- Quit character. Send SIGQUIT
signal. Recog- nized when ISIG is set, and then not passed
as input.</p>

<p>VERASE (0177, DEL, rubout, or 010, BS, Ctrl-H, or also
#) Erase charac- ter. This erases the previous
not-yet-erased character, but does not erase past EOF or
beginning-of-line. Recognized when ICANON is set, and then
not passed as input.</p>

<p>VKILL (025, NAK, Ctrl-U, or Ctrl-X, or also @) Kill
character. This erases the input since the last EOF or
beginning-of-line. Rec- ognized when ICANON is set, and then
not passed as input.</p>

<p>VEOF (004, EOT, Ctrl-D) End-of-file character. More
precisely: this character causes the pending tty buffer to
be sent to the wait- ing user program without waiting for
end-of-line. If it is the first character of the line, the
read(2) in the user program returns 0, which signifies
end-of-file. Recognized when ICANON is set, and then not
passed as input.</p>

<p>VMIN Minimum number of characters for non-canonical
read.</p>

<p>VEOL (0, NUL) Additional end-of-line character.
Recognized when ICANON is set.</p>

<p>VTIME Timeout in deciseconds for non-canonical read.</p>

<p>VEOL2 (not in POSIX; 0, NUL) Yet another end-of-line
character. Rec- ognized when ICANON is set.</p>

<p>VSWTCH (not in POSIX; not supported under Linux; 0, NUL)
Switch charac- ter. (Used by shl only.)</p>

<p>VSTART (021, DC1, Ctrl-Q) Start character. Restarts
output stopped by the Stop character. Recognized when IXON
is set, and then not passed as input.</p>

<p>VSTOP (023, DC3, Ctrl-S) Stop character. Stop output
until Start character typed. Recognized when IXON is set,
and then not passed as input.</p>

<p>VSUSP (032, SUB, Ctrl-Z) Suspend character. Send SIGTSTP
signal. Recognized when ISIG is set, and then not passed as
input.</p>

<p>VDSUSP (not in POSIX; not supported under Linux; 031,
EM, Ctrl-Y) Delayed suspend character: send SIGTSTP signal
when the charac- ter is read by the user program. Recognized
when IEXTEN and ISIG are set, and the system supports job
control, and then not passed as input.</p>

<p>VLNEXT (not in POSIX; 026, SYN, Ctrl-V) Literal next.
Quotes the next input character, depriving it of a possible
special meaning. Recognized when IEXTEN is set, and then not
passed as input.</p>

<p>VWERASE (not in POSIX; 027, ETB, Ctrl-W) Word erase.
Recognized when ICANON and IEXTEN are set, and then not
passed as input.</p>

<p>VREPRINT (not in POSIX; 022, DC2, Ctrl-R) Reprint unread
characters. Recognized when ICANON and IEXTEN are set, and
then not passed as input.</p>

<p>VDISCARD (not in POSIX; not supported under Linux; 017,
SI, Ctrl-O) Tog- gle: start/stop discarding pending output.
Recognized when IEX- TEN is set, and then not passed as
input.</p>

<p>VSTATUS (not in POSIX; not supported under Linux; status
request: 024, DC4, Ctrl-T).</p>

<p>These symbolic subscript values are all different,
except that VTIME, VMIN may have the same value as VEOL,
VEOF, respectively. In non- canonical mode the special
character meaning is replaced by the timeout meaning. For an
explanation of VMIN and VTIME, see the description of
non-canonical mode below.</p>

<p>Retrieving and changing terminal settings tcgetattr()
gets the parameters associated with the object referred by
fd and stores them in the termios structure referenced by
termios_p. This function may be invoked from a background
process; however, the terminal attributes may be
subsequently changed by a foreground pro- cess.</p>

<p>tcsetattr() sets the parameters associated with the
terminal (unless support is required from the underlying
hardware that is not available) from the termios structure
referred to by termios_p. optional_actions specifies when
the changes take effect:</p>

<p>TCSANOW the change occurs immediately.</p>

<p>TCSADRAIN the change occurs after all output written to
fd has been trans- mitted. This function should be used when
changing parameters that affect output.</p>

<p>TCSAFLUSH the change occurs after all output written to
the object referred by fd has been transmitted, and all
input that has been received but not read will be discarded
before the change is made.</p>

<p>Canonical and non-canonical mode The setting of the
ICANON canon flag in c_lflag determines whether the terminal
is operating in canonical mode (ICANON set) or non-canonical
mode (ICANON unset). By default, ICANON set.</p>

<p>In canonical mode:</p>

<p>* Input is made available line by line. An input line is
available when one of the line delimiters is typed (NL, EOL,
EOL2; or EOF at the start of line). Except in the case of
EOF, the line delimiter is included in the buffer returned
by read(2).</p>

<p>* Line editing is enabled (ERASE, KILL; and if the
IEXTEN flag is set: WERASE, REPRINT, LNEXT). A read(2)
returns at most one line of input; if the read(2) requested
fewer bytes than are available in the current line of input,
then only as many bytes as requested are read, and the
remaining characters will be available for a future
read(2).</p>

<p>In non-canonical mode input is available immediately
(without the user having to type a line-delimiter
character), and line editing is dis- abled. The settings of
MIN (c_cc[VMIN]) and TIME (c_cc[VTIME]) deter- mine the
circumstances in which a read(2) completes; there are four
distinct cases:</p>

<p>* MIN == 0; TIME == 0: If data is available, read(2)
returns immedi- ately, with the lesser of the number of
bytes available, or the num- ber of bytes requested. If no
data is available, read(2) returns 0.</p>

<p>* MIN &gt; 0; TIME == 0: read(2) blocks until the lesser
of MIN bytes or the number of bytes requested are available,
and returns the lesser of these two values.</p>

<p>* MIN == 0; TIME &gt; 0: TIME specifies the limit for a
timer in tenths of a second. The timer is started when
read(2) is called. read(2) returns either when at least one
byte of data is available, or when the timer expires. If the
timer expires without any input becoming available, read(2)
returns 0.</p>

<p>* MIN &gt; 0; TIME &gt; 0: TIME specifies the limit for
a timer in tenths of a second. Once an initial byte of input
becomes available, the timer is restarted after each further
byte is received. read(2) returns either when the lesser of
the number of bytes requested or MIN byte have been read, or
when the inter-byte timeout expires. Because the timer is
only started after the initial byte becomes available, at
least one byte will be read.</p>

<p>Raw mode cfmakeraw() sets the terminal to something like
the &quot;raw&quot; mode of the old Version 7 terminal
driver: input is available character by charac- ter, echoing
is disabled, and all special processing of terminal input
and output characters is disabled. The terminal attributes
are set as follows:</p>

<p>termios_p-&gt;c_iflag &amp;= ~(IGNBRK | BRKINT | PARMRK
| ISTRIP | INLCR | IGNCR | ICRNL | IXON);
termios_p-&gt;c_oflag &amp;= ~OPOST; termios_p-&gt;c_lflag
&amp;= ~(ECHO | ECHONL | ICANON | ISIG | IEXTEN);
termios_p-&gt;c_cflag &amp;= ~(CSIZE | PARENB);
termios_p-&gt;c_cflag |= CS8;</p>

<p>Line control tcsendbreak() transmits a continuous stream
of zero-valued bits for a specific duration, if the terminal
is using asynchronous serial data transmission. If duration
is zero, it transmits zero-valued bits for at least 0.25
seconds, and not more that 0.5 seconds. If duration is not
zero, it sends zero-valued bits for some
implementation-defined length of time.</p>

<p>If the terminal is not using asynchronous serial data
transmission, tcsendbreak() returns without taking any
action.</p>

<p>tcdrain() waits until all output written to the object
referred to by fd has been transmitted.</p>

<p>tcflush() discards data written to the object referred
to by fd but not transmitted, or data received but not read,
depending on the value of queue_selector:</p>

<p>TCIFLUSH flushes data received but not read.</p>

<p>TCOFLUSH flushes data written but not transmitted.</p>

<p>TCIOFLUSH flushes both data received but not read, and
data written but not transmitted.</p>

<p>tcflow() suspends transmission or reception of data on
the object referred to by fd, depending on the value of
action:</p>

<p>TCOOFF suspends output.</p>

<p>TCOON restarts suspended output.</p>

<p>TCIOFF transmits a STOP character, which stops the
terminal device from transmitting data to the system.</p>

<p>TCION transmits a START character, which starts the
terminal device transmitting data to the system.</p>

<p>The default on open of a terminal file is that neither
its input nor its output is suspended.</p>

<p>Line speed The baud rate functions are provided for
getting and setting the values of the input and output baud
rates in the termios structure. The new values do not take
effect until tcsetattr() is successfully called.</p>

<p>Setting the speed to B0 instructs the modem to
&quot;hang up&quot;. The actual bit rate corresponding to
B38400 may be altered with setserial(8).</p>

<p>The input and output baud rates are stored in the
termios structure.</p>

<p>cfgetospeed() returns the output baud rate stored in the
termios struc- ture pointed to by termios_p.</p>

<p>cfsetospeed() sets the output baud rate stored in the
termios structure pointed to by termios_p to speed, which
must be one of these constants:</p>

<p>B0 B50 B75 B110 B134 B150 B200 B300 B600 B1200 B1800
B2400 B4800 B9600 B19200 B38400 B57600 B115200 B230400</p>

<p>The zero baud rate, B0, is used to terminate the
connection. If B0 is specified, the modem control lines
shall no longer be asserted. Nor- mally, this will
disconnect the line. CBAUDEX is a mask for the speeds beyond
those defined in POSIX.1 (57600 and above). Thus, B57600
&amp; CBAUDEX is non-zero.</p>

<p>cfgetispeed() returns the input baud rate stored in the
termios struc- ture.</p>

<p>cfsetispeed() sets the input baud rate stored in the
termios structure to speed, which must be specified as one
of the Bnnn constants listed above for cfsetospeed(). If the
input baud rate is set to zero, the input baud rate will be
equal to the output baud rate.</p>

<p>cfsetspeed() is a 4.4BSD extension. It takes the same
arguments as cfsetispeed(), and sets both input and output
speed.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE cfgetispeed() returns the input baud rate
stored in the termios struc- ture.</p>

<p>cfgetospeed() returns the output baud rate stored in the
termios struc- ture.</p>

<p>All other functions return:</p>

<p>0 on success.</p>

<p>-1 on failure and set errno to indicate the error.</p>

<p>Note that tcsetattr() returns success if any of the
requested changes could be successfully carried out.
Therefore, when making multiple changes it may be necessary
to follow this call with a further call to tcgetattr() to
check that all changes have been performed successfully.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO tcgetattr(), tcsetattr(), tcsendbreak(),
tcdrain(), tcflush(), tcflow(), cfgetispeed(),
cfgetospeed(), cfsetispeed(), and cfse- tospeed() are
specified in POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>cfmakeraw() and cfsetspeed() are non-standard, but
available on the BSDs.</p>

<p>NOTES Unix V7 and several later systems have a list of
baud rates where after the fourteen values B0, ..., B9600
one finds the two constants EXTA, EXTB (&quot;External
A&quot; and &quot;External B&quot;). Many systems extend the
list with much higher baud rates.</p>

<p>The effect of a non-zero duration with tcsendbreak()
varies. SunOS specifies a break of duration * N seconds,
where N is at least 0.25, and not more than 0.5. Linux, AIX,
DU, Tru64 send a break of duration milliseconds. FreeBSD and
NetBSD and HP-UX and MacOS ignore the value of duration.
Under Solaris and Unixware, tcsendbreak() with non-zero
duration behaves like tcdrain().</p>
