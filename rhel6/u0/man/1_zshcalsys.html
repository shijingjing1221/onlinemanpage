<p>ZSHCALSYS(1) ZSHCALSYS(1)</p>

<p>NAME zshcalsys - zsh calendar system</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The shell is supplied with a series of
functions to replace and enhance the traditional Unix
calendar programme, which warns the user of immi- nent or
future events, details of which are stored in a text file
(typ- ically calendar in the user s home directory). The
version provided here includes a mechanism for alerting the
user when an event is due.</p>

<p>In addition a function age is provided that can be used
in a glob qual- ifier; it allows files to be selected based
on their modification times.</p>

<p>The format of the calendar file and the dates used there
in and in the age function are described first, then the
functions that can be called to examine and modify the
calendar file.</p>

<p>The functions here depend on the availability of the
zsh/datetime mod- ule which is usually installed with the
shell. The library function strptime() must be available; it
is present on most recent operating systems.</p>

<p>FILE AND DATE FORMATS Calendar File Format The calendar
file is by default ~/calendar. This can be configured by the
calendar-file style, see the section STYLES below. The basic
for- mat consists of a series of separate lines, with no
indentation, each including a date and time specification
followed by a description of the event.</p>

<p>Various enhancements to this format are supported, based
on the syntax of Emacs calendar mode. An indented line
indicates a continuation line that continues the description
of the event from the preceding line (note the date may not
be continued in this way). An initial ampersand (&amp;) is
ignored for compatibility.</p>

<p>An indented line on which the first non-whitespace
character is # is not displayed with the calendar entry, but
is still scanned for infor- mation. This can be used to hide
information useful to the calendar system but not to the
user, such as the unique identifier used by cal-
endar_add.</p>

<p>The Emacs extension that a date with no description may
refer to a num- ber of succeeding events at different times
is not supported.</p>

<p>Unless the done-file style has been altered, any events
which have been processed are appended to the file with the
same name as the calendar file with the suffix .done, hence
~/calendar.done by default.</p>

<p>An example is shown below.</p>

<p>Date Format The format of the date and time is designed
to allow flexibility with- out admitting ambiguity. (The
words date and time are both used in the documentation
below; except where specifically noted this implies a string
that may include both a date and a time specification.) Note
that there is no localization support; month and day names
must be in English and separator characters are fixed.
Matching is case insensitive, and only the first three
letters of the names are signifi- cant, although as a
special case a form beginning &quot;month&quot; does not
match &quot;Monday&quot;. Furthermore, time zones are not
handled; all times are assumed to be local.</p>

<p>It is recommended that, rather than exploring the
intricacies of the system, users find a date format that is
natural to them and stick to it. This will avoid unexpected
effects. Various key facts should be noted.</p>

<p>&middot; In particular, note the confusion between
month/day/year and day/month/year when the month is numeric;
these formats should be avoided if at all possible. Many
alternatives are available.</p>

<p>&middot; The year must be given in full to avoid
confusion, and only years from 1900 to 2099 inclusive are
matched.</p>

<p>The following give some obvious examples; users finding
here a format they like and not subject to vagaries of style
may skip the full description. As dates and times are
matched separately (even though the time may be embedded in
the date), any date format may be mixed with any format for
the time of day provide the separators are clear
(whitespace, colons, commas).</p>

<p>2007/04/03 13:13 2007/04/03:13:13 2007/04/03 1:13 pm 3rd
April 2007, 13:13 April 3rd 2007 1:13 p.m. Apr 3, 2007 13:13
Tue Apr 03 13:13:00 2007 13:13 2007/apr/3</p>

<p>More detailed rules follow.</p>

<p>Times are parsed and extracted before dates. They must
use colons to separate hours and minutes, though a dot is
allowed before seconds if they are present. This limits time
formats to the following:</p>

<p>&middot; HH:MM[:SS[.FFFFF]] [am|pm|a.m.|p.m.]</p>

<p>&middot; HH:MM.SS[.FFFFF] [am|pm|a.m.|p.m.]</p>

<p>Here, square brackets indicate optional elements,
possibly with alter- natives. Fractions of a second are
recognised but ignored. For abso- lute times (the normal
format require by the calendar file and the age function) a
date is mandatory but a time of day is not; the time
returned is at the start of the date. One variation is
allowed: if a.m. or p.m. or one of their variants is
present, an hour without a minute is allowed, e.g. 3
p.m..</p>

<p>Time zones are not handled, though if one is matched
following a time specification it will be removed to allow a
surrounding date to be parsed. This only happens if the
format of the timezone is not too unusual. The following are
examples of forms that are understood:</p>

<p>+0100 GMT GMT-7 CET+1CDT</p>

<p>Any part of the timezone that is not numeric must have
exactly three capital letters in the name.</p>

<p>Dates suffer from the ambiguity between DD/MM/YYYY and
MM/DD/YYYY. It is recommended this form is avoided with
purely numeric dates, but use of ordinals, eg. 3rd/04/2007,
will resolve the ambiguity as the ordinal is always parsed
as the day of the month. Years must be four digits (and the
first two must be 19 or 20); 03/04/08 is not recognised.
Other numbers may have leading zeroes, but they are not
required. The following are handled:</p>

<p>&middot; YYYY/MM/DD</p>

<p>&middot; YYYY-MM-DD</p>

<p>&middot; YYYY/MNM/DD</p>

<p>&middot; YYYY-MNM-DD</p>

<p>&middot; DD[th|st|rd] MNM[,] [ YYYY ]</p>

<p>&middot; MNM DD[th|st|rd][,] [ YYYY ]</p>

<p>&middot; DD[th|st|rd]/MM[,] YYYY</p>

<p>&middot; DD[th|st|rd]/MM/YYYY</p>

<p>&middot; MM/DD[th|st|rd][,] YYYY</p>

<p>&middot; MM/DD[th|st|rd]/YYYY</p>

<p>Here, MNM is at least the first three letters of a month
name, matched case-insensitively. The remainder of the month
name may appear but its contents are irrelevant, so
janissary, febrile, martial, apricot, maybe, junta, etc. are
happily handled.</p>

<p>Where the year is shown as optional, the current year is
assumed. There are only two such cases, the form Jun 20 or
14 September (the only two commonly occurring forms, apart
from a &quot;the&quot; in some forms of English, which isnt
currently supported). Such dates will of course become
ambiguous in the future, so should ideally be avoided.</p>

<p>Times may follow dates with a colon, e.g.
1965/07/12:09:45; this is in order to provide a format with
no whitespace. A comma and whitespace are allowed, e.g.
1965/07/12, 09:45. Currently the order of these sep- arators
is not checked, so illogical formats such as 1965/07/12, :
,09:45 will also be matched. For simplicity such variations
are not shown in the list above. Otherwise, a time is only
recognised as being associated with a date if there is only
whitespace in between, or if the time was embedded in the
date.</p>

<p>Days of the week are not normally scanned, but will be
ignored if they occur at the start of the date pattern only.
However, in contexts where it is useful to specify dates
relative to today, days of the week with no other date
specification may be given. The day is assumed to be either
today or within the past week. Likewise, the words yester-
day, today and tomorrow are handled. All matches are
case-insensitive. Hence if today is Monday, then Sunday is
equivalent to yesterday, Mon- day is equivalent to today,
but Tuesday gives a date six days ago. This is not generally
useful within the calendar file. Dates in this format may be
combined with a time specification; for example Tomorrow, 8
p.m..</p>

<p>For example, the standard date format:</p>

<p>Fri Aug 18 17:00:48 BST 2006</p>

<p>is handled by matching HH:MM:SS and removing it together
with the matched (but unused) time zone. This leaves the
following:</p>

<p>Fri Aug 18 2006</p>

<p>Fri is ignored and the rest is matched according to the
standard rules.</p>

<p>Relative Time Format In certain places relative times
are handled. Here, a date is not allowed; instead a
combination of various supported periods are allowed,
together with an optional time. The periods must be in order
from most to least significant.</p>

<p>In some cases, a more accurate calculation is possible
when there is an anchor date: offsets of months or years
pick the correct day, rather than being rounded, and it is
possible to pick a particular day in a month as (1st
Friday), etc., as described in more detail below.</p>

<p>Anchors are available in the following cases. If one or
two times are passed to the function calendar, the start
time acts an anchor for the end time when the end time is
relative (even if the start time is implicit). When
examining calendar files, the scheduled event being examined
anchors the warning time when it is given explicitly by
means of the WARN keyword; likewise, the scheduled event
anchors a repetition period when given by the RPT keyword,
so that specifications such as RPT 2 months, 3rd Thursday
are handled properly. Finally, the -R argu- ment to
calendar_scandate directly provides an anchor for relative
cal- culations.</p>

<p>The periods handled, with possible abbreviations
are:</p>

<p>Years years, yrs, ys, year, yr, y, yearly. A year is
365.25 days unless there is an anchor.</p>

<p>Months months, mons, mnths, mths, month, mon, mnth, mth,
monthly. Note that m, ms, mn, mns are ambiguous and are not
handled. A month is a period of 30 days rather than a
calendar month unless there is an anchor.</p>

<p>Weeks weeks, wks, ws, week, wk, w, weekly</p>

<p>Days days, dys, ds, day, dy, d, daily</p>

<p>Hours hours, hrs, hs, hour, hr, h, hourly</p>

<p>Minutes minutes, mins, minute, min, but not m, ms, mn or
mns</p>

<p>Seconds seconds, secs, ss, second, sec, s</p>

<p>Spaces between the numbers are optional, but are
required between items, although a comma may be used (with
or without spaces).</p>

<p>The forms yearly to hourly allow the number to be
omitted; it is assumed to be 1. For example, 1 d and daily
are equivalent. Note that using those forms with plurals is
confusing; 2 yearly is the same as 2 years, not twice
yearly, so it is recommended they only be used without
numbers.</p>

<p>When an anchor time is present, there is an extension to
handle regular events in the form of the nth someday of the
month. Such a specifica- tion must occur immediately after
any year and month specification, but before any time of
day, and must be in the form n(th|st|rd) day, for example
1st Tuesday or 3rd Monday. As in other places, days are
matched case insensitively, must be in English, and only the
first three letters are significant except that a form
beginning month does not match Monday. No attempt is made to
sanitize the resulting date; attempts to squeeze too many
occurrences into a month will push the day into the next
month (but in the obvious fashion, retaining the correct day
of the week).</p>

<p>Here are some examples:</p>

<p>30 years 3 months 4 days 3:42:41 14 days 5 hours
Monthly, 3rd Thursday 4d,10hr</p>

<p>Example Here is an example calendar file. It uses a
consistent date format, as recommended above.</p>

<p>Feb 1, 2006 14:30 Pointless bureaucratic meeting Mar 27,

<p>The second entry has a continuation line. The third
entry has a con- tinuation line that will not be shown when
the entry is displayed, but the unique identifier will be
used by the calendar_add function when updating the event.
The fourth entry will produce a warning 30 minutes before
the event (to allow you to equip yourself appropriately).
The fifth entry repeats after a month on the 3rd Thursday,
i.e. June 15, 2006, at the same time.</p>

<p>USER FUNCTIONS This section describes functions that are
designed to be called directly by the user. The first part
describes those functions associ- ated with the user s
calendar; the second part describes the use in glob
qualifiers.</p>

<p>Calendar system functions calendar [ -abdDsv ] [ -C
calfile ] [ -n num ] [ -S showprog ] [ [ start ] end ](
calendar -r [ -abdDrsv ] [ -C calfile ] [ -n num ] [ -S
showprog ] [ start ] Show events in the calendar.</p>

<p>With no arguments, show events from the start of today
until the end of the next working day after today. In other
words, if today is Friday, Saturday, or Sunday, show up to
the end of the following Monday, otherwise show today and
tomorrow.</p>

<p>If end is given, show events from the start of today up
to the time and date given, which is in the format described
in the previous section. Note that if this is a date the
time is assumed to be midnight at the start of the date, so
that effec- tively this shows all events before the given
date.</p>

<p>end may start with a +, in which case the remainder of
the spec- ification is a relative time format as described
in the previous section indicating the range of time from
the start time that is to be included.</p>

<p>If start is also given, show events starting from that
time and date. The word now can be used to indicate the
current time.</p>

<p>To implement an alert when events are due, include
calendar -s in your ~/.zshrc file.</p>

<p>Options:</p>

<p>-a Show all items in the calendar, regardless of the
start and end.</p>

<p>-b Brief: don t display continuation lines (i.e.
indented lines following the line with the date/time), just
the first line.</p>

<p>-B lines Brief: display at most the first lines lines of
the cal- endar entry. -B 1 is equivalent to -b.</p>

<p>-C calfile Explicitly specify a calendar file instead of
the value of the calendar-file style or the the default
~/calendar.</p>

<p>-d Move any events that have passed from the calendar
file to the &quot;done&quot; file, as given by the done-file
style or the default which is the calendar file with .done
appended. This option is implied by the -s option.</p>

<p>-D Turns off the option -d, even if the -s option is
also present.</p>

<p>-n num, -num Show at least num events, if present in the
calendar file, regardless of the start and end.</p>

<p>-r Show all the remaining options in the calendar,
ignoring the given end time. The start time is respected;
any argument given is treated as a start time.</p>

<p>-s Use the shells sched command to schedule a timed
event that will warn the user when an event is due. Note
that the sched command only runs if the shell is at an
inter- active prompt; a foreground task blocks the scheduled
task from running until it is finished.</p>

<p>The timed event usually runs the programme calendar_show
to show the event, as described in the section UTILITY
FUNCTIONS below.</p>

<p>By default, a warning of the event is shown five minutes
before it is due. The warning period can be configured by
the style warn-time or for a single calendar entry by
including WARN reltime in the first line of the entry, where
reltime is one of the usual relative time formats.</p>

<p>A repeated event may be indicated by including RPT rel-
date in the first line of the entry. After the scheduled
event has been displayed it will be re-entered into the
calendar file at a time reldate after the existing event.
Note that this is currently the only use made of the repeat
count, so that it is not possible to query the schedule for
a recurrence of an event in the calendar until the previous
event has passed.</p>

<p>It is safe to run calendar -s to reschedule an existing
event (if the calendar file has changed, for example), and
also to have it running in multiples instances of the shell
since the calendar file is locked when in use.</p>

<p>By default, expired events are moved to the
&quot;done&quot; file; see the -d option. Use -D to prevent
this.</p>

<p>-S showprog Explicitly specify a programme to be used
for showing events instead of the value of the show-prog
style or the default calendar_show.</p>

<p>-v Verbose: show more information about stages of
process- ing. This is useful for confirming that the
function has successfully parsed the dates in the calendar
file.</p>

<p>calendar_add [ -BL ] event ... Adds a single event to
the calendar in the appropriate location. The event can
contain multiple lines, as described in the sec- tion
Calendar File Format above. Using this function ensures that
the calendar file is sorted in date and time order. It also
makes special arrangements for locking the file while it is
altered. The old calendar is left in a file with the suffix
.old.</p>

<p>The option -B indicates that backing up the calendar
file will be handled by the caller and should not be
performed by calen- dar_add. The option -L indicates that
calendar_add does not need to lock the calendar file as it
is already locked. These options will not usually be needed
by users.</p>

<p>If the style reformat-date is true, the date and time of
the new entry will be rewritten into the standard date
format: see the descriptions of this style and the style
date-format.</p>

<p>The function can use a unique identifier stored with
each event to ensure that updates to existing events are
treated correctly. The entry should contain the word UID,
followed by whitespace, followed by a word consisting
entirely of hexadecimal digits of arbitrary length (all
digits are significant, including leading zeroes). As the
UID is not directly useful to the user, it is convenient to
hide it on an indented continuation line starting with a #,
for example:</p>

<p>Aug 31, 2007 09:30 Celebrate the end of the holidays #
UID 045B78A0</p>

<p>The second line will not be shown by the calendar
function.</p>

<p>calendar_edit This calls the users editor to edit the
calendar file. The editor is given by the variable VISUAL,
if set, else the vari- able EDITOR. If the calendar
scheduler was running, then after editing the file calendar
-s is called to update it.</p>

<p>This function locks out the calendar system during the
edit. Hence it should be used to edit the calendar file if
there is any possibility of a calendar event occurring
meanwhile.</p>

<p>calendar_parse calendar-entry This is the internal
function that analyses the parts of a cal- endar entry,
which is passed as the only argument. The function returns
status 1 if the argument could not be parsed as a calen- dar
entry and status 2 if the wrong number of arguments were
passed; it also sets the parameter reply to an empty
associative array. Otherwise, it returns status 0 and sets
elements of the associative array reply as follows: time The
time as a string of digits in the same units as $EPOCHSEC-
ONDS text1 The text from the line not including the date and
time of the event, but including any WARN or RPT keywords
and values. warntime Any warning time given by the WARN
keyword as a string of digits containing the time at which
to warn in the same units as $EPOCHSECONDS. (Note this is an
absolute time, not the relative time passed down.) Not set
no WARN keyword and value were matched. warnstr The raw
string matched after the WARN keyword, else unset. rpttime
Any recurrence time given by the RPT keyword as a string of
dig- its containing the time of the recurrence in the same
units as $EPOCHSECONDS. (Note this is an absolute time.) Not
set if no RPT keyword and value were matched. rptstr The raw
string matched after the RPT keyword, else unset. text2 The
text from the line after removal of the date and any key-
words and values. )</p>

<p>calendar_showdate [ -r ] [ -f fmt ] date-spec ... The
given date-spec is interpreted and the corresponding date
and time printed. If the initial date-spec begins with a +
or - it is treated as relative to the current time;
date-specs after the first are treated as relative to the
date calculated so far and a leading + is optional in that
case. This allows one to use the system as a date
calculator. For example, calen- dar_showdate +1 month, 1st
Fridayshows the date of the first Friday of next month.</p>

<p>With the option -r nothing is printed but the value of
the date and time in seconds since the epoch is stored in
the parameter REPLY.</p>

<p>With the option -f fmt the given date/time conversion
format is passed to strftime; see notes on the date-format
style below.</p>

<p>In order to avoid ambiguity with negative relative date
specifi- cations, options must occur in separate words; in
other words, -r and -f should not be combined in the same
word.</p>

<p>calendar_sort Sorts the calendar file into date and time
order. The old calendar is left in a file with the suffix
.old.</p>

<p>Glob qualifiers The function age can be autoloaded and
use separately from the calendar system, although it uses
the function calendar_scandate for date for- matting. It
requires the zsh/stat builtin, which makes available the
builtin stat. This may conflict with an external programme
of the same name; if it does, the builtin may be disabled
for normal operation by including the following code in an
initialization file:</p>

<p>zmodload -i zsh/stat disable stat</p>

<p>age selects files having a given modification time for
use as a glob qualifier. The format of the date is the same
as that understood by the calendar system, described in the
section FILE AND DATE FORMATS above.</p>

<p>The function can take one or two arguments, which can be
supplied either directly as command or arguments, or
separately as shell parame- ters.</p>

<p>print *(e:age 2006/10/04 2006/10/09:)</p>

<p>The example above matches all files modified between the
start of those dates. The second argument may alternatively
be a relative time intro- duced by a +:</p>

<p>print *(e:age 2006/10/04 +5d:)</p>

<p>The example above is equivalent to the previous
example.</p>

<p>In addition to the special use of days of the week,
today and yester- day, times with no date may be specified;
these apply to today. Obvi- ously such uses become
problematic around midnight.</p>

<p>print *(e-age 12:00 13:30-)</p>

<p>The example above shows files modified between 12:00 and
13:00 today.</p>

<p>print *(e:age 2006/10/04:)</p>

<p>The example above matches all files modified on that
date. If the sec- ond argument is omitted it is taken to be
exactly 24 hours after the first argument (even if the first
argument contains a time).</p>

<p>print *(e-age 2006/10/04:10:15 2006/10/04:10:45-)</p>

<p>The example above supplies times. Note that whitespace
within the time and date specification must be quoted to
ensure age receives the cor- rect arguments, hence the use
of the additional colon to separate the date and time.</p>

<p>AGEREF1=2006/10/04:10:15 AGEREF2=2006/10/04:10:45 print
*(+age)</p>

<p>This shows the same example before using another form of
argument pass- ing. The dates and times in the parameters
AGEREF1 and AGEREF2 stay in effect until unset, but will be
overridden if any argument is passed as an explicit argument
to age. Any explicit argument causes both parame- ters to be
ignored.</p>

<p>STYLES The zsh style mechanism using the zstyle command
is describe in zshmod- ules(1). This is the same mechanism
used in the completion system.</p>

<p>The styles below are all examined in the context
:datetime:function:, for example :datetime:calendar:.</p>

<p>calendar-file The location of the main calendar. The
default is ~/calendar.</p>

<p>date-format A strftime format string (see strftime(3))
with the zsh exten- sions providing various numbers with no
leading zero or space if the number is a single digit as
described for the %D{string} prompt format in the section
EXPANSION OF PROMPT SEQUENCES in zshmisc(1).</p>

<p>This is used for outputting dates in calendar, both to
support the -v option and when adding recurring events back
to the cal- endar file, and in calendar_showdate as the
final output format.</p>

<p>If the style is not set, the default used is similar the
stan- dard system format as output by the date command (also
known as ctime format): %a %b %d %H:%M:%S %Z %Y.</p>

<p>done-file The location of the file to which events which
have passed are appended. The default is the calendar file
location with the suffix .done. The style may be set to an
empty string in which case a &quot;done&quot; file will not
be maintained.</p>

<p>reformat-date Boolean, used by calendar_add. If it is
true, the date and time of new entries added to the calendar
will be reformatted to the format given by the style
date-format or its default. Only the date and time of the
event itself is reformatted; any subsidiary dates and times
such as those associated with repeat and warning times are
left alone.</p>

<p>show-prog The programme run by calendar for showing
events. It will be passed the start time and stop time of
the events requested in seconds since the epoch followed by
the event text. Note that calendar -s uses a start time and
stop time equal to one another to indicate alerts for
specific events.</p>

<p>The default is the function calendar_show.</p>

<p>warn-time The time before an event at which a warning
will be displayed, if the first line of the event does not
include the text EVENT reltime. The default is 5
minutes.</p>

<p>UTILITY FUNCTIONS calendar_lockfiles Attempt to lock the
files given in the argument. To prevent problems with
network file locking this is done in an ad hoc fashion by
attempting to create a symbolic link to the file with the
name file.lockfile. No other system level functions are used
for locking, i.e. the file can be accessed and modified by
any utility that does not use this mechanism. In particular,
the user is not prevented from editing the calendar file at
the same time unless calendar_edit is used.</p>

<p>Three attempts are made to lock the file before giving
up. If the module zsh/zselect is available, the times of the
attempts are jittered so that multiple instances of the
calling function are unlikely to retry at the same time.</p>

<p>The files locked are appended to the array lockfiles,
which should be local to the caller.</p>

<p>If all files were successfully locked, status zero is
returned, else status one.</p>

<p>This function may be used as a general file locking
function, although this will only work if only this
mechanism is used to lock files.</p>

<p>calendar_read This is a backend used by various other
functions to parse the calendar file, which is passed as the
only argument. The array calendar_entries is set to the list
of events in the file; no pruning is done except that
ampersands are removed from the start of the line. Each
entry may contain multiple lines.</p>

<p>calendar_scandate This is a generic function to parse
dates and times that may be used separately from the
calendar system. The argument is a date or time
specification as described in the section FILE AND DATE
FORMATS above. The parameter REPLY is set to the number of
seconds since the epoch corresponding to that date or time.
By default, the date and time may occur anywhere within the
given argument.</p>

<p>Returns status zero if the date and time were
successfully parsed, else one.</p>

<p>Options: -a The date and time are anchored to the start
of the argu- ment; they will not be matched if there is
preceding text.</p>

<p>-A The date and time are anchored to both the start and
end of the argument; they will not be matched if the is any
other text in the argument.</p>

<p>-d Enable additional debugging output.</p>

<p>-m Minus. When -R anchor_time is also given the relative
time is calculated backwards from anchor_time.</p>

<p>-r The argument passed is to be parsed as a relative
time.</p>

<p>-R anchor_time The argument passed is to be parsed as a
relative time. The time is relative to anchor_time, a time
in seconds since the epoch, and the returned value is the
absolute time corresponding to advancing anchor_time by the
rela- tive time given. This allows lengths of months to be
correctly taken into account. If the final day does not
exist in the given month, the last day of the final month is
given. For example, if the anchor time is during 31st
January 2007 and the relative time is 1 month, the final
time is the same time of day during 28th February 2007.</p>

<p>-s In addition to setting REPLY, set REPLY2 to the
remainder of the argument after the date and time have been
stripped. This is empty if the option -A was given.</p>

<p>-t Allow a time with no date specification. The date is
assumed to be today. The behaviour is unspecified if the
iron tongue of midnight is tolling twelve.</p>

<p>calendar_show The function used by default to display
events. It accepts a start time and end time for events,
both in epoch seconds, and an event description.</p>

<p>The event is always printed to standard output. If the
command line editor is active (which will usually be the
case) the com- mand line will be redisplayed after the
output.</p>

<p>If the parameter DISPLAY is set and the start and end
times are the same (indicating a scheduled event), the
function uses the command xmessage to display a window with
the event details.</p>

<p>BUGS As the system is based entirely on shell functions
(with a little sup- port from the zsh/datetime module) the
mechanisms used are not as robust as those provided by a
dedicated calendar utility. Consequently the user should not
rely on the shell for vital alerts.</p>

<p>There is no calendar_delete function.</p>

<p>There is no localization support for dates and times,
nor any support for the use of time zones.</p>

<p>Relative periods of months and years do not take into
account the vari- able number of days.</p>

<p>The calendar_show function is currently hardwired to use
xmessage for displaying alerts on X Window System displays.
This should be config- urable and ideally integrate better
with the desktop.</p>

<p>calendar_lockfiles hangs the shell while waiting for a
lock on a file. If called from a scheduled task, it should
instead reschedule the event that caused it.</p>
