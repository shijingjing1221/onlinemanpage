<p>GIT-PACK-REFS(1) Git Manual GIT-PACK-REFS(1)</p>

<p>NAME git-pack-refs - Pack heads and tags for efficient
repository access</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS git pack-refs [--all] [--no-prune]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Traditionally, tips of branches and tags
(collectively known as refs) were stored one file per ref
under $GIT_DIR/refs directory. While many branch tips tend
to be updated often, most tags and some branch tips are
never updated. When a repository has hundreds or thousands
of tags, this one-file-per-ref format both wastes storage
and hurts performance.</p>

<p>This command is used to solve the storage and
performance problem by stashing the refs in a single file,
$GIT_DIR/packed-refs. When a ref is missing from the
traditional $GIT_DIR/refs hierarchy, it is looked up in this
file and used if found.</p>

<p>Subsequent updates to branches always create new files
under $GIT_DIR/refs hierarchy.</p>

<p>A recommended practice to deal with a repository with
too many refs is to pack its refs with --all --prune once,
and occasionally run git pack-refs --prune. Tags are by
definition stationary and are not expected to change. Branch
heads will be packed with the initial pack-refs --all, but
only the currently active branch heads will become unpacked,
and the next pack-refs (without --all) will leave them
unpacked.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --all The command by default packs all tags and
refs that are already packed, and leaves other refs alone.
This is because branches are expected to be actively
developed and packing their tips does not help performance.
This option causes branch tips to be packed as well. Useful
for a repository with many branches of historical
interests.</p>

<p>--no-prune The command usually removes loose refs under
$GIT_DIR/refs hierarchy after packing them. This option
tells it not to.</p>
