<p>MUNMAP(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual MUNMAP(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME munmap - unmap pages of memory</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/mman.h&gt;</p>

<p>int munmap(void *addr, size_t len);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The munmap() function shall remove any
mappings for those entire pages containing any part of the
address space of the process starting at addr and continuing
for len bytes. Further references to these pages shall
result in the generation of a SIGSEGV signal to the process.
If there are no mappings in the specified address range,
then munmap() has no effect.</p>

<p>The implementation shall require that addr be a multiple
of the page size {PAGESIZE}.</p>

<p>If a mapping to be removed was private, any
modifications made in this address range shall be
discarded.</p>

<p>Any memory locks (see mlock() and mlockall()) associated
with this address range shall be removed, as if by an
appropriate call to munlock().</p>

<p>If a mapping removed from a typed memory object causes
the correspond- ing address range of the memory pool to be
inaccessible by any process in the system except through
allocatable mappings (that is, mappings of typed memory
objects opened with the POSIX_TYPED_MEM_MAP_ALLOCATABLE
flag), then that range of the memory pool shall become
deallocated and may become available to satisfy future typed
memory allocation requests.</p>

<p>A mapping removed from a typed memory object opened with
the POSIX_TYPED_MEM_MAP_ALLOCATABLE flag shall not affect in
any way the availability of that typed memory for
allocation.</p>

<p>The behavior of this function is unspecified if the
mapping was not established by a call to mmap().</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, munmap() shall
return 0; otherwise, it shall return -1 and set errno to
indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The munmap() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL Addresses in the range [addr,addr+len) are
outside the valid range for the address space of a
process.</p>

<p>EINVAL The len argument is 0.</p>

<p>EINVAL The addr argument is not a multiple of the page
size as returned by sysconf().</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The munmap() function is only
supported if the Memory Mapped Files option or the Shared
Memory Objects option is supported.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The munmap() function corresponds to SVR4,
just as the mmap() function does.</p>

<p>It is possible that an application has applied process
memory locking to a region that contains shared memory. If
this has occurred, the mun- map() call ignores those locks
and, if necessary, causes those locks to be removed.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
