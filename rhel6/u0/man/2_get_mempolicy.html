<p>NAME get_mempolicy - get the current process or memory
address NUMA policy</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS int sys_get_mempolicy (int *policy, unsigned
long *nmask, unsigned long maxnode, unsigned long addr,
unsigned long flags);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION get_mempolicy retrieves the NUMA policy of
the current process or a memory address specified by addr.
The memory policy defines which node memory is allocated to
for the process. The policy is stored in policy when
non-zero, with an associated nmask. maxnode is the maximum
bit number plus one that can be stored into nmask. The bit
number is round- ed to a multiple of unsigned long. The only
valid value other than zero for flags is MPOL_F_ILNODE. This
value is only valid when the policy being retrieved is
MPOL_INTERLEAVE. When this flag is specified, an un- signed
long with the next node that would be used for interleaving
is returned in nodemask.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE get_mempolicy returns 0 on success;
otherwise, it returns one of the errors listed in the
&quot;Errors&quot; section.</p>

<p>ERRORS -EINVAL An illegal parameter was passed in.</p>

<p>-EFAULT Invalid memory area accessed.</p>

include in the man- pages package. They are available via
the numactl-x.x.tar.gz package.</p>
