<p>NAME XmCreatePulldownMenu A RowColumn widget convenience
creation function</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;Xm/RowColumn.h&gt; Widget
XmCreatePulldownMenu( Widget parent, String name, ArgList
arglist, Cardinal argcount);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION XmCreatePulldownMenu creates an instance of
a RowColumn widget of type XmMENU_PULLDOWN and returns the
associated widget ID.</p>

<p>parent Specifies the parent widget ID</p>

<p>name Specifies the name of the created widget</p>

<p>arglist Specifies the argument list</p>

<p>argcount Specifies the number of attribute/value pairs
in the argument list (arglist)</p>

<p>Specifies the number of attribute/value pairs in the
argument list (arglist). When this function is used to
create the Pulldown menu pane, a MenuShell widget is
automatically created as the parent of the menu pane. If the
widget specified by the parent parameter is a Popup or a
Pulldown menu pane, the MenuShell widget is created as a
child of the parent MenuShell; otherwise, it is created as a
child of the speci- fied parent widget.</p>

<p>XmCreatePulldownMenu is provided as a convenience
function for creating RowColumn widgets configured to
operate as Pulldown menu panes and is not implemented as a
separate widget class.</p>

<p>A Pulldown menu pane displays a 3-D shadow, unless the
feature is dis- abled by the application. The shadow appears
around the edge of the menu pane.</p>

<p>A Pulldown menu pane is used with submenus that are to
be attached to a CascadeButton or a CascadeButtonGadget.
This is the case for all menu panes that are part of a
PulldownMenu system (a MenuBar), the menu pane associated
with an OptionMenu, and any menu panes that cascade from a
Popup menu pane. Pulldown menu panes that are to be
associated with an OptionMenu must be created before the
OptionMenu is created.</p>

<p>The Pulldown menu pane must be attached to a
CascadeButton or Cascade- ButtonGadget that resides in a
MenuBar, a Popup menu pane, a Pulldown menu pane, or an
OptionMenu. It is attached with the button resource
XmNsubMenuId.</p>

<p>A MenuShell widget is required between the Pulldown menu
pane and its parent. If the application uses this
convenience function for creating a Pulldown menu pane, the
MenuShell is automatically created as the real parent of the
menu pane; otherwise, it is the applications responsibility
to create the MenuShell widget.</p>

<p>To function correctly when incorporated into a menu, the
Pulldown menu panes hierarchy must be considered. This
hierarchy depends on the type of menu system that is being
built, as follows:</p>

<p>&middot; If the Pulldown menu pane is to be pulled down
from a MenuBar, its parent must be the MenuBar.</p>

<p>&middot; If the Pulldown menu pane is to be pulled down
from a Popup or another Pulldown menu pane, its parent must
be that Popup or Pulldown menu pane.</p>

<p>&middot; If the Pulldown menu pane is to be pulled down
from an Option- Menu, its parent must be the same as the
OptionMenu parent.</p>

<p>PullDown menu panes support tear-off capabilities for
tear-off menus through XmRowColumn resources. For a complete
definition of RowColumn and its associated resources, see
XmRowColumn(3).</p>

<p>RETURN Returns the RowColumn widget ID.</p>
