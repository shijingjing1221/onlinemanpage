<p>NAME stdbuf - Run COMMAND, with modified buffering
operations for its stan- dard streams.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS stdbuf OPTION... COMMAND</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Run COMMAND, with modified buffering
operations for its standard streams.</p>

<p>Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for
short options too.</p>

<p>-i, --input=MODE Adjust standard input stream
buffering</p>

<p>-o, --output=MODE Adjust standard output stream
buffering</p>

<p>-e, --error=MODE Adjust standard error stream
buffering</p>

<p>--help display this help and exit</p>

<p>--version output version information and exit</p>

<p>If MODE is L the corresponding stream will be line
buffered. This option is invalid with standard input.</p>

<p>If MODE is 0 the corresponding stream will be
unbuffered.</p>

<p>Otherwise MODE is a number which may be followed by one
of the follow- ing: KB 1000, K 1024, MB 1000*1000, M
1024*1024, and so on for G, T, P, E, Z, Y. In this case the
corresponding stream will be fully buffered with the buffer
size set to MODE bytes.</p>

<p>NOTE: If COMMAND adjusts the buffering of its standard
streams (tee does for e.g.) then that will override
corresponding settings changed by stdbuf. Also some filters
(like dd and cat etc.) don t use streams for I/O, and are
thus unaffected by stdbuf settings.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES tail -f access.log | stdbuf -oL cut -d &rsquo;
&rsquo; -f1 | uniq This will immedidately display unique
entries from access.log</p>

<p>BUGS On GLIBC platforms, specifying a buffer size, i.e.
using fully buffered mode will result in undefined
operation.</p>
