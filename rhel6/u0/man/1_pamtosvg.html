<p>NAME pamtosvg - convert a Netpbm image to a SVG
(Scalable Vector Graphics) image</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pamtosvg</p>

<p>[-background-color=colorname] [-centerline]

<p>Minimum unique abbreviation of option is acceptable. You
may use dou- ble hyphens instead of single hyphen to denote
options. You may use white space in place of the equals sign
to separate an option name from its value.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pamtosvg reads a PNM image as input and produce an SVG
(Scalable Vector Graphics) image as output. Thus, it traces
curves in the input image and creates a set of splines that
represent the image.</p>

<p>SVG is a vector image format, which means it describes
curves that com- pose an image. By contrast, PNM is a raster
format, which means it describes dots that compose an image.
The main practical difference between the two types is that
you can scale vector images better. A vector image also
takes a lot less data to describe an image if the image is
composed of simple curves.</p>

<p>That means it is really an understatement to say that
pamtosvg is an image format converter. Its really an image
tracer. Its main job is to trace a raster image and find the
lines in it. It then represents its findings in SVG
format.</p>

<p>pamtosvg does the same kind of thing that StreamLine,
CorelTrace, and Autotrace do. It is in fact derived from
Autotrace.</p>

<p>SVG is a gigantic format, capable of amazing things.
pamtosvg exploits only a morsel of it. The SVG image
produced by pamtosvg consists of a single &lt;svg&gt;
element, which has a width attribute and a height attribute.
The value of that element is composed of &lt;path&gt;
elements. Thats it.</p>

<p>In the SVG output, distances are unitless, with one unit
corresponding to one pixel of the input.</p>

<p>So that pamtosvg will find simple curves in the image,
you may want to remove speckles from it with pbmclean and
consolidate multiple shades into single colors with pnmquant
first.</p>

<p>For more information on SVG, see the Worldwide Web
Consortiums SVG web page .</p>

<p>OPTIONS -background-color=colorname Treat the specified
color as the background color and ignore it.</p>

<p>If you don t specify this option, pamtosvg does not
recognize any background color.</p>

<p>Specify the color (colorname) as described for the
argument of the ppm_parsecolor() library routine .</p>

<p>-centerline Trace an objects centerline.</p>

<p>By default, pamtosvg traces an objects outline.</p>

<p>-corner-always-threshold=angle Consider any angle at a
pixel which falls below angle angle (in decimal floating
point degrees) as a corner, even if it is bor- dered by
other corner pixels. Default is 60 degrees.</p>

<p>-corner-surround=integer Consider the specified number
of pixels on either side of a point when determining if that
point is a corner. Default is 4.</p>

<p>-corner-threshold=angle Consider any pixel which forms
an angle with its predecessors and successors that is
smaller than angle (in decimal floating point degrees) as a
corner. Default is 100.</p>

<p>-error-threshold=float Subdivide fitted curves that are
offset by a number of pixels exceeding the specified number.
Default is 2.0.</p>

<p>-filter-iterations=integer Smooth the curve the
specified number of times prior to fitting Default is 4.</p>

<p>-line-reversion-threshold=float When a spline is closer
to a straight line than the specified real number weighted
by the square of the curve length, maintain it as a straight
line, even if it is a list with curves.</p>

<p>Default is .01.</p>

<p>-line-threshold=float If a spline does not deviate from
the straight line defined by its endpoints by more than the
specified number of pixels, then treat it as a straight
line.</p>

<p>Default is 1.</p>

<p>-log Create a log of the curve tracing process (suitable
for debug- ging). Put it in the file named inputfile.log in
the current directory, where inputfile is the root of the
input file name, or pamtosvg if the input is from Standard
Input or a file with a weird name.</p>

<p>-preserve-width Preserve line width prior to thinning.
Meaningful only with -centerline.</p>

<p>remove-adjacent-corners Remove adjacent corners.</p>

<p>-report-progress Report the progress of the tracing to
Standard Error as it hap- pens.</p>

<p>-tangent-surround Consider the specified number of
points to either side of a point when computing the tangent
at that point. Default is 3.</p>

<p>-width-weight-factor Weight factor for fitting the
linewidth.</p>

<p>Application Notes A convenient way to view an SVG
document is with a web browser. Many understand a file whose
name ends in .svg to be an SVG image and can render it.</p>

<p>HISTORY pamtosvg was added to Netpbm in Version 10.33
(March 2006).</p>

<p>The core of pamtosvg -- the curve tracing logic -- was
taken nearly unmodified from Martin Weber s Autotrace
program. That program dupli- cates a lot of Netpbm function,
so pamtosvg is a much leaner program.</p>

<p>Bryan Henderson created pamtosvg, basically just by
adapting Autotrace to Netpbm.</p>

<p>Autotrace was first released in 2000 and updates were
released through 2002. A number of people wrote the code in
it, but Masatake Yamato and Martin Weber appear to be the
principal creators of it.</p>

<p>As of June 2006, there was a Sourceforge project for
it.</p>
