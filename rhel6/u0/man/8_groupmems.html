<p>NAME groupmems - administer members of a user&acute;s
primary group</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS groupmems -a user_name | -d user_name | [-g
group_name] | -l | -p</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The groupmems command allows a user to
administer his/her own group membership list without the
requirement of superuser privileges. The groupmems utility
is for systems that configure its users to be in their own
name sake primary group (i.e., guest / guest).</p>

<p>Only the superuser, as administrator, can use groupmems
to alter the memberships of other groups.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The options which apply to the groupmems command
are:</p>

<p>-a, --add user_name Add an user to the group membership
list.</p>

<p>If the /etc/gshadow file exist, and the group has no
entry in the /etc/gshadow file, a new entry will be
created.</p>

<p>-d, --delete user_name Delete a user from the group
membership list.</p>

<p>If the /etc/gshadow file exist, the user will be removed
from the list of members and administrators of the
group.</p>

<p>If the /etc/gshadow file exist, and the group has no
entry in the /etc/gshadow file, a new entry will be
created.</p>

<p>-g, --group group_name The superuser can specify which
group membership list to modify.</p>

<p>-l, --list List the group membership list.</p>

<p>-p, --purge Purge all users from the group membership
list.</p>

<p>If the /etc/gshadow file exist, and the group has no
entry in the /etc/gshadow file, a new entry will be
created.</p>

<p>SETUP The groupmems executable should be in mode 2770 as
user root and in group groups. The system administrator can
add users to group groups to allow or disallow them using
the groupmems utility to manage their own group membership
list.</p>

<p>$ groupadd -r groups $ chmod 2770 groupmems $ chown
root.groups groupmems $ groupmems -g groups -a gk4</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION The following configuration variables in
/etc/login.defs change the behavior of this tool:</p>

<p>MAX_MEMBERS_PER_GROUP (number) Maximum members per group
entry. When the maximum is reached, a new group entry (line)
is started in /etc/group (with the same name, same password,
and same GID).</p>

<p>The default value is 0, meaning that there are no limits
in the number of members in a group.</p>

<p>This feature (split group) permits to limit the length
of lines in the group file. This is useful to make sure that
lines for NIS groups are not larger than 1024
characters.</p>

<p>If you need to enforce such limit, you can use 25.</p>

<p>Note: split groups may not be supported by all tools
(even in the Shadow toolsuite). You should not use this
variable unless you really need it.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/group Group account information.</p>

<p>/etc/gshadow secure group account information</p>

<p>SEE ALSO chfn(1), chsh(1), passwd(1), groupadd(8),
groupdel(8), useradd(8), userdel(8), usermod(8).</p>
