<p>NAME XmText The Text widget class</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;Xm/Text.h&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Text provides a single-line and multiline
text editor for customizing both user and programmatic
interfaces. It can be used for single-line string entry,
forms entry with verification procedures, and full-window
editing. It provides an application with a consistent
editing system for textual data. The screens textual data
adjusts to the application writers needs.</p>

<p>Text provides separate callback lists to verify movement
of the insert cursor, modification of the text, and changes
in input focus. Each of these callbacks provides the
verification function with the widget instance, the event
that caused the callback, and a data structure spe- cific to
the verification type. From this information, the function
can verify if the application considers this to be a
legitimate state change and can signal the widget whether to
continue with the action.</p>

<p>The user interface tailors a new set of translations.
The default translations provide key bindings for insert
cursor movement, deletion, insertion, and selection of
text.</p>

<p>Text allows the user to select regions of text.
Selection is based on the model specified in the
Inter-Client Communication Conventions Man- ual (ICCCM).
Text supports primary and secondary selection.</p>

<p>In some Asian languages, texts are drawn vertically.
Also, some charac- ters are displayed with 90-degree
clockwise rotation, and other charac- ters are mapped to
vertical glyphs that differ from the normal horiza- ontal
glyphs. Information about which characters require rotation
or mapping to vertical glyphs is specified in the X Locale
Database (NLS databases) and handled by X library, depending
on XNOrientation XOC values. XmText widget should also
handle the vertically aligned lines as for editing,
entering, or selecting texts.</p>

<p>The vertical writing feature of the XmText widget is
enabled when the XmTOP_TO_BOTTOM value is specified for the
XmNlayoutDirection resource of the XmText widget. In that
case, the horizontal scroll bar is dis- played on the bottom
of the XmText widget and the vertical scroll bar is
displayed on the left side.</p>

<p>Mouse Selection The Text widget allows text to be
edited, inserted, and selected. The user can cut, copy, and
paste text by using the clipboard, primary transfer, or
secondary transfer. Text also provides a Drag and Drop
facility that enables the user to copy or move data within
Text or to a different widget. When keyboard focus policy is
set to EXPLICIT, the widget that receives focus is the
destination widget. In POINTER mode, any keyboard or mouse
operation (except secondary selection) in an editable widget
establishes that widget as the destination.</p>

<p>If a destination widget becomes insensitive or
uneditable, it forfeits its destination status. In EXPLICIT
mode, when a widget becomes insen- sitive, the focus moves
to another widget. If that widget is editable, it becomes
the destination widget; otherwise, there is no destination
widget. The text of any insensitive Text widget is stippled,
indicating its state to the user.</p>

<p>The insertion cursor, displayed as an I-beam, shows
where input is inserted. Input is inserted just before the
insertion cursor.</p>

<p>Text uses the XmQTnavigator, XmQTspecifyRenderTable, and
XmQTscroll- Frame traits, and holds the XmQTaccessTextual
and XmQTtransfer traits. The widget checks its parent for
the XmQTscrollFrame trait. If this trait does not exist,
then the widget has no scrolling. If the trait does exist,
and the ScrollFrame widget has not been initialized, the
widget creates two navigators and sets up the
scrollbars.</p>

<p>If an application or widget calls the setValue trait
method of XmQTac- cessTextual, then XmText will call
XmTextSetString to set the string value.</p>

<p>Classes Text inherits behavior, resources, and traits
from Core and XmPrimi- tive.</p>

<p>The class pointer is xmTextWidgetClass.</p>

<p>The class name is XmText.</p>

<p>Data Transfer Behavior Text supports transfer of the
primary, secondary, and clipboard selec- tions and dragging
of selected text from the widget. Text can also be the
destination for the primary, secondary, and clipboard
selections, and it supports dropping of data being dragged
onto the widget.</p>

<p>When the XmNconvertCallback procedures are called, the
location_data member of the XmConvertCallbackStruct member
is NULL if the selected text is being transferred. If the
entire text, not the selected text, is being transferred,
the value of this member is the widget ID of the Text
widget.</p>

<p>As a source of data, Text supports the following targets
and associated conversions of data to these targets:</p>

<p>locale If the locale target matches the widgets locale,
the widget transfers the selected text in the encoding of
the locale.</p>

<p>COMPOUND_TEXT The widget transfers the selected text as
type COMPOUND_TEXT.</p>

<p>STRING The widget transfers the selected text as type
STRING.</p>

<p>TEXT If the selected text is fully convertible to the
encoding of the locale, the widget transfers the selected
text in the encoding of the locale. Otherwise, the widget
transfers the selected text as type COMPOUND_TEXT.</p>

<p>UTF8_STRING The widget transfers the selected text as
type UTF8_STRING.</p>

<p>DELETE The widget deletes the selected text.</p>

<p>_MOTIF_CLIPBOARD_TARGETS The widget transfers, as type
ATOM, a list of the targets to which the widget can convert
data to be placed on the clip- board immediately. If the
selected text is fully convertible to STRING, these include
STRING; otherwise, they include COM- POUND_TEXT.</p>

<p>_MOTIF_DEFERRED_CLIPBOARD_TARGETS The widget transfers,
as type ATOM, a list of the targets it supports for delayed
transfer for the CLIPBOARD selection. This widget currently
supplies no targets for
_MOTIF_DEFERRED_CLIPBOARD_TARGETS.</p>

<p>_MOTIF_EXPORT_TARGETS The widget transfers, as type
ATOM, a list of the targets to be used as the value of the
DragContext s XmNexportTargets in a drag-and-drop transfer.
These include COMPOUND_TEXT, UTF8_STRING, the encoding of
the locale, STRING, TEXT, BACK- GROUND, and FOREGROUND.</p>

<p>_MOTIF_LOSE_SELECTION The widget takes the following
actions:</p>

<p>&middot; When losing the PRIMARY selection, it
unhighlights the selected text and calls the
XmNlosePrimaryCallback pro- cedures.</p>

<p>&middot; When losing the SECONDARY selection, it removes
the secondary selection highlight.</p>

<p>&middot; When losing the _MOTIF_DESTINATION selection,
if the widget does not have focus, it changes the cursor to
indicate that the widget is no longer the destination.</p>

<p>As a source of data, Text also supports the following
standard Motif targets:</p>

<p>BACKGROUND The widget transfers XmNbackground as type
PIXEL.</p>

<p>CLASS The widget finds the first shell in the widget
hierarchy that has a WM_CLASS property and transfers the
contents as text in the current locale.</p>

<p>CLIENT_WINDOW The widget finds the first shell in the
widget hierarchy and transfers its window as type
WINDOW.</p>

<p>COLORMAP The widget transfers XmNcolormap as type
COLORMAP.</p>

<p>FOREGROUND The widget transfers XmNforeground as type
PIXEL.</p>

<p>NAME The widget finds the first shell in the widget
hierarchy that has a WM_NAME property and transfers the
contents as text in the current locale.</p>

<p>TARGETS The widget transfers, as type ATOM, a list of
the targets it supports. These include the standard targets
in this list. These also include COMPOUND_TEXT, UTF8_STRING,
the encoding of the locale, STRING, and TEXT.</p>

<p>TIMESTAMP The widget transfers the timestamp used to
acquire the selec- tion as type INTEGER.</p>

<p>_MOTIF_RENDER_TABLE The widget transfers XmNrenderTable
if it exists, or else the default text render table, as type
STRING.</p>

<p>_MOTIF_ENCODING_REGISTRY The widget transfers its
encoding registry as type STRING. The value is a list of
NULL separated items in the form of tag encoding pairs. This
target symbolizes the transfer tar- get for the Motif
Segment Encoding Registry. Widgets and applications can use
this Registry to register text encoding formats for
specified render table tags. Applications access this
Registry by calling XmRegisterSegmentEncoding and
XmMapSegmentEncoding.</p>

<p>As a destination for data, Text chooses a target and
requests conver- sion of the selection to that target. If
the encoding of the locale is present in the list of
available targets, Text chooses a requested tar- get from
the available targets in the following order of
preference:</p>

<p>1. The encoding of the locale</p>

<p>2. TEXT</p>

<p>4. UTF8_STRING</p>

<p>3. COMPOUND_TEXT</p>

<p>4. STRING</p>

<p>If the encoding of the locale is not present in the list
of available targets, Text chooses a requested target from
the available targets in the following order of
preference:</p>

<p>4. UTF8_STRING</p>

<p>1. COMPOUND_TEXT</p>

<p>2. STRING</p>

<p>New Resources The following table defines a set of
widget resources used by the pro- grammer to specify data.
The programmer can also set the resource val- ues for the
inherited classes to set attributes for this widget. To
reference a resource by name or by class in a .Xdefaults
file, remove the XmN or XmC prefix and use the remaining
letters. To specify one of the defined values for a resource
in a .Xdefaults file, remove the Xm prefix and use the
remaining letters (in either lowercase or uppercase, but
include any underscores between words). The codes in the
access column indicate if the given resource can be set at
creation time (C), set by using XtSetValues (S), retrieved
by using XtGetValues (G), or is not applicable (N/A).</p>

1 This resource cannot be set in a resource file.</p>

<p>XmNactivateCallback Specifies the list of callbacks that
is called when the user invokes an event that calls the
activate() action. The type of the structure whose address
is passed to this callback is XmAnyCallbackStruct. The
reason sent by the callback is XmCR_ACTIVATE.</p>

<p>XmNautoShowCursorPosition Ensures that the visible text
contains the insert cursor when set to True. If the insert
cursor changes, the contents of Text may scroll in order to
bring the insertion point into the window. Setting this
resource to False, however, does not ensure that Text will
not scroll.</p>

<p>XmNcursorPosition Indicates the position in the text
where the current insert cursor is to be located. Position
is determined by the num- ber of characters from the
beginning of the text. The first character position is 0
(zero).</p>

<p>XmNcursorPositionVisible If the widget has an
XmPrintShell as one of its ancestors, then the default value
is False; otherwise, it is True.</p>

<p>XmNdestinationCallback Specifies a list of callbacks
called when the widget is the destination of a transfer
operation. The type of the struc- ture whose address is
passed to these callbacks is XmDestina- tionCallbackStruct.
The reason is XmCR_OK.</p>

<p>XmNeditable When set to True, indicates that the user
can edit the text string. Prohibits the user from editing
the text when set to False.</p>

<p>When XmNeditable is used on a widget it sets the
dropsite to XmDROP_SITE_ACTIVE.</p>

<p>XmNeditMode Specifies the set of keyboard bindings used
in Text. The default, XmSINGLE_LINE_EDIT, provides the set
of key bindings to be used in editing single-line text.
XmMULTI_LINE_EDIT provides the set of key bindings to be
used in editing multi- line text.</p>

<p>The results of placing a Text widget inside a
ScrolledWindow when the Texts XmNeditMode is
XmSINGLE_LINE_EDIT are unde- fined.</p>

<p>XmNfocusCallback Specifies the list of callbacks called
when Text accepts input focus. The type of the structure
whose address is passed to this callback is
XmAnyCallbackStruct. The reason sent by the callback is
XmCR_FOCUS.</p>

<p>XmNgainPrimaryCallback Specifies the list of callbacks
called when an event causes the Text widget to gain
ownership of the primary selection. The reason sent by the
callback is XmCR_GAIN_PRIMARY.</p>

<p>XmNlosePrimaryCallback Specifies the list of callbacks
called when an event causes the Text widget to lose
ownership of the primary selection. The reason sent by the
callback is XmCR_LOSE_PRIMARY.</p>

<p>XmNlosingFocusCallback Specifies the list of callbacks
called before Text loses input focus. The type of the
structure whose address is passed to this callback is
XmTextVerifyCallbackStruct. The reason sent by the callback
is XmCR_LOSING_FOCUS.</p>

<p>XmNmarginHeight Specifies the distance between the top
edge of the widget window and the text, and between the
bottom edge of the wid- get window and the text.</p>

<p>XmNmarginWidth Specifies the distance between the left
edge of the widget window and the text, and between the
right edge of the widget window and the text.</p>

<p>XmNmaxLength Specifies the maximum length of the text
string that can be entered into text from the keyboard. This
value must be non- negative. Strings that are entered by
using the XmNvalue resource or the XmTextSetString function
ignore this resource.</p>

<p>XmNmodifyVerifyCallback Specifies the list of callbacks
called before text is deleted from or inserted into Text.
The type of the structure whose address is passed to this
callback is XmTextVerifyCallback- Struct. The reason sent by
the callback is XmCR_MODIFYING_TEXT_VALUE. When multiple
Text widgets share the same source, only the widget that
initiates the source change will generate
XmNmodifyVerifyCallback.</p>

<p>If both XmNmodifyVerifyCallback and
XmNmodifyVerifyCallback- Wcs are registered callback lists,
the procedure(s) in the XmNmodifyVerifyCallback list is
always executed first; and the resulting data, which may
have been modified, is passed to the
XmNmodifyVerifyCallbackWcs callback routines.</p>

<p>XmNmodifyVerifyCallbackWcs Specifies the list of
callbacks called before text is deleted from or inserted
into Text. The type of the structure whose address is passed
to this callback is XmTextVerifyCallback- StructWcs. The
reason sent by the callback is XmCR_MODIFY- ING_TEXT_VALUE.
When multiple Text widgets share the same source, only the
widget that initiates the source change will generate the
XmNmodifyVerifyCallbackWcs.</p>

<p>If both XmNmodifyVerifyCallback and
XmNmodifyVerifyCallback- Wcs are registered callback lists,
the procedure(s) in the XmNmodifyVerifyCallback list is
always executed first; and the resulting data, which may
have been modified, is passed to the
XmNmodifyVerifyCallbackWcs callback routines.</p>

<p>XmNmotionVerifyCallback Specifies the list of callbacks
called before the insert cur- sor is moved to a new
position. The type of the structure whose address is passed
to this callback is XmTextVerifyCall- backStruct. The reason
sent by the callback is XmCR_MOV- ING_INSERT_CURSOR. It is
possible for more than one XmNmo- tionVerifyCallback to be
generated from a single action.</p>

<p>XmNsource Specifies the source with which the widget
displays text. If no source is specified, the widget creates
a default string source. This resource can be used to share
text sources between Text widgets.</p>

<p>XmNtopCharacter Displays the position of text at the top
of the window. Position is determined by the number of
characters from the beginning of the text. The first
character position is 0 (zero).</p>

<p>If the XmNeditMode is XmMULTI_LINE_EDIT, the line of
text that contains the top character is displayed at the top
of the widget without shifting the text left or right.
XtGet- Values for XmNtopCharacter returns the position of
the first character in the line that is displayed at the top
of the widget.</p>

<p>XmNtotalLines Indicates the number of lines in the text
widget buffer (not necessarily visible). The initial value 1
means the text buffer is empty. The number of lines reported
takes into account the wordWrap policy (that is, its not
simply the number of newline characters.</p>

<p>XmNvalue Specifies the string value of the Text widget
as a char* data value. Moves the cursor to position 0 unless
a value of XmN- cursorPosition was explicitly supplied in
the argument list. If XmNvalue and XmNvalueWcs are both
defined, the value of XmNvalueWcs supersedes that of
XmNvalue. XtGetValues returns a copy of the value of the
internal buffer and XtSetValues copies the string values
into the internal buffer.</p>

<p>XmNvalueChangedCallback Specifies the list of callbacks
called after text is deleted from or inserted into Text. The
type of the structure whose address is passed to this
callback is XmAnyCallbackStruct. The reason sent by the
callback is XmCR_VALUE_CHANGED. When multiple Text widgets
share the same source, only the widget that initiates the
source change will generate the XmNval- ueChangedCallback.
This callback represents a change in the source in the Text,
not in the Text widget. The XmNval- ueChangedCallback should
occur only in pairs with an XmNmodi- fyVerifyCallback,
assuming that the doit flag in the callback structure of the
XmNmodifyVerifyCallback is not set to False.</p>

<p>XmNvalueWcs Specifies the string value of the Text
widget as a wchar_t* data value. Moves the cursor to
position 0 unless a value of XmNcursorPosition was
explicitly supplied in the argument list.</p>

<p>This resource cannot be specified in a resource
file.</p>

<p>If XmNvalue and XmNvalueWcs are both defined, the value
of XmNvalueWcs supersedes that of XmNvalue. XtGetValues
returns a copy of the value of the internal buffer encoded
as a wide character string. XtSetValues copies the value of
the wide character string into the internal buffer.</p>

<p>XmNverifyBell Specifies whether the bell should sound
when the verification returns without continuing the action.
The default depends on the value of the ancestor VendorShell
s XmNaudibleWarning resource.</p>

+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
XmNpendingDelete Indicates that pending delete mode is on
when the Boolean value is True. Pending deletion is defined
as deletion of the selected text when an insertion is
made.</p>

<p>XmNselectionArray Defines the actions for multiple mouse
clicks. The value of the resource is an array of
XmTextScanType elements. XmTextScanType is an enumeration
indicating possible actions. Each mouse click performed
within some time of the previous mouse click increments the
index into this array and performs the defined action for
that index. (This &quot;multiclick&quot; time is specified
by the operating environment, and varies among dif- ferent
systems. In general, it is usually set to some frac- tion of
a second.) The possible actions in the order they occur in
the default array are as follows:</p>

<p>3. XmSELECT_POSITION, which resets the insert cursor
posi- tion.</p>

<p>4. XmSELECT_WORD, which selects a word.</p>

<p>5. XmSELECT_LINE, which selects a line of text. This
action sees a line as delimited by hard newline charac-
ters. In other words, if the word wrap feature is on
(XmNwordWrap is True), this will ignore the newlines
automatically inserted by the widget. This is the
default.</p>

<p>6. XmSELECT_OUT_LINE, which selects a line of text. This
action sees a line as delimited by hard or soft newline
characters. In other words, if the word wrap feature is on
(XmNwordWrap is True), the newlines automatically inserted
by the widget will be treated as delimiting lines.</p>

<p>7. XmSELECT_ALL, which selects all of the text.</p>

<p>XmNselectionArrayCount Indicates the number of elements
in the XmNselectionArray resource. The value must not be
negative.</p>

<p>XmNselectThreshold Specifies the number of pixels of
motion that is required to select the next character when
selection is performed using the click-drag mode of
selection. The value must not be neg- ative. This resource
also specifies whether a drag should be started and the
number of pixels to start a drag when Btn2Down and Btn1Down
are integrated.</p>

XmNblinkRate Specifies the blink rate of the text cursor in
milliseconds. The time indicated in the blink rate relates
to the time the cursor is visible and the time the cursor is
invisible (that is, the time it takes to blink the insertion
cursor on and off is twice the blink rate). The cursor does
not blink when the blink rate is set to 0 (zero). The value
must not be negative.</p>

<p>XmNcolumns Specifies the initial width of the text
window as an integer number of characters. The width equals
the number of charac- ters specified by this resource
multiplied by the width as derived from the specified font.
If the em-space value is available, it is used. If not, the
width of the numeral &quot;0&quot; is used. If this is not
available, the maximum width is used. For proportionate
fonts, the actual number of characters that fit on a given
line may be greater than the value specified. The value must
be greater than 0 (zero). The default value depends on the
value of the XmNwidth resource. If no width is specified the
default is 20.</p>

<p>When the XmNlayoutDirection resource is XmTOP_TO_BOTTOM,
and if the XmText widget resource XmNeditMode is XmSIN-
GLE_LINE_EDIT, this attribute is ignored. If no width is
specified, the default is 1.</p>

<p>XmNcursorPositionVisible Indicates that the insert
cursor position is marked by a text cursor when the Boolean
value is True.</p>

<p>XmNfontList Specifies the font list to be used for Text.
The font list is an obsolete structure and is retained only
for compatibility with earlier releases of Motif. Use the
render table (XmNren- derTable) instead of font lists
wherever possible. If both are specified, the render table
will take precedence. If this value is NULL at
initialization, the parent hierarchy of the widget is
searched for an ancestor that holds the XmQTspeci-
fyRenderTable trait. If such an ancestor is found, the font
list is initialized to the XmTEXT_RENDER_TABLE value of the
ancestor widget. If no such ancestor is found, the default
is implementation dependent.</p>

<p>Text searches the font list for the first occurrence of
a font set that has XmFONTLIST_DEFAULT_TAG. If a default
ele- ment is not found, the first font set in the font list
is used. If the list contains no font sets, the first font
in the font list will be used. Refer to XmFontList(3) for
more information on a font list structure.</p>

<p>XmNrenderTable Specifies the render table to be used in
deriving a font set or font for rendering text. If both a
render table and a font list are specified, the render table
will take precedence. If the value of XmNrenderTable is NULL
at initialization, the parent hierarchy of the widget is
searched for an ancestor that holds the
XmQTspecifyRenderTable trait. If such an ancestor is found,
the font list is initialized to the XmTEXT_RENDER_TABLE
value of the ancestor widget. If no such ancestor is found,
the default is implementation dependent.</p>

<p>Text searches the render table for the first occurrence
of a rendition that has the tag _MOTIF_DEFAULT_LOCALE. If a
default element is not found, the first rendition in the ta-
ble is used. Refer to XmRenderTable(3) for more information
on the render table structure.</p>

<p>XmNresizeHeight Indicates that Text will attempt to
resize its height to accommodate all the text contained in
the widget when the Boolean value is True. If the Boolean
value is set to True, the text is always displayed, starting
from the first posi- tion in the source, even if instructed
otherwise. This attribute is ignored when the application
uses a Text widget whose parent is a ScrolledWindow and when
XmNscrollVertical is True.</p>

<p>When the XmNlayoutDirection resource is XmTOP_TO_BOTTOM,
this resource indicates that the text attempts to resize its
height to accommodate all the text contained in the widget
when the Boolean value is True. This attribute is ignored if
XmNwordWrap is True.</p>

<p>XmNresizeWidth Indicates that Text attempts to resize
its width to accommo- date all the text contained in the
widget when the Boolean value is True. This attribute is
ignored if XmNwordWrap is True.</p>

<p>When the XmNlayoutDirection resource is XmTOP_TO_BOTTOM,
this attribute is still effective even if XmNwordWrap is
True. Also, this attribute is ignored when the application
uses a text widget whose parent is a ScrolledWindow and
XmNscroll- Horizaontal is True.</p>

<p>XmNrows Specifies the initial height of the text window
measured in character heights. This attribute is ignored if
the text wid- get resource XmNeditMode is
XmSINGLE_LINE_EDIT. The value must be greater than 0 (zero).
The default value depends on the value of the XmNheight
resource. If no height is speci- fied, the default is 1.</p>

<p>When the XmNlayoutDirection resource is XmTOP_TO_BOTTOM,
this attribute is still effective, even if the XmText widget
resource XmNeditMode is XmSINGLE_LINE_EDIT. If no height is
specified, the default is 20.</p>

<p>XmNwordWrap Indicates that lines are to be broken at
word breaks (that is, the text does not go off the right
edge of the window) when the Boolean value is True. Words
are defined as a sequence of characters separated by
whitespace. Whitespace is defined as a space, tab, or
newline. This attribute is ignored if the text widget
resource XmNeditMode is XmSIN- GLE_LINE_EDIT. Note that this
resource is only valid when the widget is not a scroll one,
or, if the widget is a scroll widget, that the
XmNscrollHorizontal resource is False.</p>

<p>Indicates that lines are to be broken at word breaks
(that is, when the XmNlayoutDirection resource is
XmTOP_TO_BOTTOM, the text does not go off the bottom edge of
the window) when the Boolean value is True.</p>

<p>The following resources are used only when text is
created in a ScrolledWindow. See the reference page for
XmCreateScrolledText.</p>

Note in connection with this table that if the
XmNlayoutDirection resource is XmTOP_TO_BOTTOM, the default
is True.</p>

<p>XmNscrollHorizontal Adds a ScrollBar that allows the
user to scroll horizontally through text when the Boolean
value is True. This resource is forced to False when the
Text widget is placed in a ScrolledWindow with
XmNscrollingPolicy set to XmAUTOMATIC.</p>

<p>When the XmNlayoutDirection resource is XmTOP_TO_BOTTOM,
this attribute is ignored if the XmText widget resource
XmNedit- Mode is XmSINGLE_LINE_EDIT.</p>

<p>XmNscrollLeftSide Indicates that the vertical ScrollBar
should be placed on the left side of the scrolled text
window when the Boolean value is True. This attribute is
ignored if XmNscrollVertical is False or the Text resource
XmNeditMode is XmSINGLE_LINE_EDIT.</p>

<p>When the XmNlayoutDirection resource is XmTOP_TO_BOTTOM,
this resource is still effective, even if the XmText widget
resource XmNeditMode is XmSINGLE_LINE_EDIT.</p>

<p>XmNscrollTopSide Indicates that the horizontal ScrollBar
should be placed on the top side of the scrolled text window
when the Boolean value is True.</p>

<p>When the XmNlayoutDirection resource is XmTOP_TO_BOTTOM,
this attribute is ignored if XmNscrollHorizontal is False or
the Xmtext resource XmNeditMode is XmSINGLE_LINE_EDIT.</p>

<p>XmNscrollVertical Adds a ScrollBar that allows the user
to scroll vertically through text when the Boolean value is
True. This attribute is ignored if the Text resource
XmNeditMode is XmSIN- GLE_LINE_EDIT. This resource is forced
to False when the Text widget is placed in a ScrolledWindow
with XmNscrolling- Policy set to XmAUTOMATIC.</p>

<p>When the XmNlayoutDirection resource is XmTOP_TO_BOTTOM,
this resource is still effective, even if the XmText widget
resource XmNeditMode is XmSINGLE_LINE_EDIT.</p>

Callback Information A pointer to the following structure is
passed to each callback:</p>

<p>typedef struct { int reason; XEvent * event; }
XmAnyCallbackStruct;</p>

<p>reason Indicates why the callback was invoked</p>

<p>event Points to the XEvent that triggered the
callback</p>

<p>The Text widget defines a new callback structure for use
with verifica- tion callbacks. Note that not all fields are
relevant for every call- back reason. The application must
first look at the reason field and use only the structure
members that are valid for the particular rea- son. The
values startPos, endPos, and text in the callback structure
XmTextVerifyCallbackStruct may be modified when the callback
is received, and these changes will be reflected as changes
made to the source of the Text widget. (For example, all
keystrokes can be con- verted to spaces or NULL characters
when a password is entered into a Text widget.) The
application programmer should not overwrite the text field,
but should attach data to that pointer.</p>

<p>A pointer to the following structure is passed to
callbacks for XmNlos- ingFocusCallback,
XmNmodifyVerifyCallback, and XmNmotionVerifyCallback:</p>

<p>typedef struct { int reason; XEvent * event; Boolean
doit; XmTextPosition currInsert, newInsert; XmTextPosition
startPos, endPos; XmTextBlock text; }
XmTextVerifyCallbackStruct, *XmTextVerifyPtr;</p>

<p>reason Indicates why the callback was invoked.</p>

<p>event Points to the XEvent that triggered the callback.
It can be NULL. For example, changes made to the Text widget
program- matically do not have an event that can be passed
to the associated callback.</p>

<p>doit Indicates whether the action that invoked the
callback is performed. Setting doit to False negates the
action. Note that not all actions may be negated. For
example, XmCR_LOS- ING_FOCUS callbacks may be beyond the
control of the widget if they are produced by mouse
clicks.</p>

<p>currInsert Indicates the current position of the insert
cursor.</p>

<p>newInsert Indicates the position at which the user
attempts to position the insert cursor.</p>

<p>startPos Indicates the starting position of the text to
modify. If the callback is not a modify verification
callback, this value is the same as currInsert.</p>

<p>endPos Indicates the ending position of the text to
modify. If no text is replaced or deleted, the value is the
same as start- Pos. If the callback is not a modify
verification callback, this value is the same as
currInsert.</p>

<p>text Points to a structure of type XmTextBlockRec. This
structure holds the textual information to be inserted.</p>

<p>typedef struct { char *ptr; int length; XmTextFormat
format; } XmTextBlockRec, *XmTextBlock;</p>

<p>ptr Points to the text to be inserted.</p>

<p>length Specifies the length of the text to be
inserted.</p>

<p>format Specifies the format of the text, either
XmFMT_8_BIT or XmFMT_16_BIT.</p>

<p>A pointer to the following structure is passed to
callbacks for XmNmod- ifyVerifyCallbackWcs.</p>

<p>typedef struct { int reason; XEvent *event; Boolean
doit; XmTextPosition currInsert, newInsert; XmTextPosition
startPos, endPos; XmTextBlockWcs text; }
XmTextVerifyCallbackStructWcs, *XmTextVerifyPtrWcs;</p>

<p>reason Indicates why the callback was invoked.</p>

<p>event Points to the XEvent that triggered the callback.
It can be NULL. For example, changes made to the Text widget
program- matically do not have an event that can be passed
to the associated callback.</p>

<p>doit Indicates whether the action that invoked the
callback is performed. Setting doit to False negates the
action. Note that not all actions may be negated. For
example, XmCR_LOS- ING_FOCUS callbacks may be beyond the
control of the widget if they are produced by mouse
clicks.</p>

<p>currInsert Indicates the current position of the insert
cursor.</p>

<p>newInsert Indicates the position at which the user
attempts to position the insert cursor.</p>

<p>startPos Indicates the starting position of the text to
modify. If the callback is not a modify verification
callback, this value is the same as currInsert.</p>

<p>endPos Indicates the ending position of the text to
modify. If no text is replaced or deleted, the value is the
same as start- Pos. If the callback is not a modify
verification callback, this value is the same as
currInsert.</p>

<p>text Points to the following structure of type
XmTextBlockRecWcs. This structure holds the textual
information to be inserted.</p>

<p>typedef struct { wchar_t *wcsptr; int length; }
XmTextBlockRecWcs, *XmTextBlockWcs;</p>

<p>wcsptr Points to the wide character text to be
inserted.</p>

<p>length Specifies the number of characters to be
inserted.</p>

<p>The following table describes the reasons for which the
individual ver- ification callback structure fields are
valid. Note that the event field will never be valid for
XmCR_MOVING_INSERT_CURSOR.</p>


<p>+----------------------------------------------------------------+
|Reason Valid Fields | |XmCR_LOSING_FOCUS reason, event,
doit, currInsert, | | newInsert, startPos, endPos |
|XmCR_MODIFYING_TEXT_VALUE reason, event, doit, currInsert,
| | newInsert, startPos, endPos, text |
|XmCR_MOVING_INSERT_CURSOR reason, doit, currInsert,
newInsert |
+----------------------------------------------------------------+
A pointer to the following callback structure is passed to
the XmNdes- tinationCallback procedures:</p>

<p>typedef struct { int reason; XEvent *event; Atom
selection; XtEnum operation; int flags; XtPointer
transfer_id; XtPointer destination_data; XtPointer
location_data; Time time; } XmDestinationCallbackStruct;</p>

<p>reason Indicates why the callback was invoked.</p>

<p>event Points to the XEvent that triggered the callback.
It can be NULL.</p>

<p>selection Indicates the selection for which data
transfer is being requested. Possible values are CLIPBOARD,
PRIMARY, SEC- ONDARY, and _MOTIF_DROP.</p>

<p>operation Indicates the type of transfer operation
requested.</p>

<p>&middot; When the selection is PRIMARY or SECONDARY,
possible values are XmMOVE, XmCOPY, and XmLINK.</p>

<p>&middot; When the selection is CLIPBOARD, possible
values are XmCOPY and XmLINK.</p>

<p>&middot; When the selection is _MOTIF_DROP, possible
values are XmMOVE, XmCOPY, XmLINK, and XmOTHER. A value of
XmOTHER means that the callback procedure must get fur- ther
information from the XmDropProcCallbackStruct structure in
the destination_data member.</p>

<p>flags Indicates whether or not the destination widget is
also the source of the data to be transferred. Following are
the pos- sible values:</p>

<p>XmCONVERTING_NONE The destination widget is not the
source of the data to be transferred.</p>

<p>XmCONVERTING_SAME The destination widget is the source
of the data to be transferred.</p>

<p>transfer_id Serves as a unique ID to identify the
transfer transaction.</p>

<p>destination_data Contains information about the
destination. When the selec- tion is _MOTIF_DROP, the
callback procedures are called by the drop site s
XmNdropProc, and destination_data is a pointer to the
XmDropProcCallbackStruct structure passed to the XmNdropProc
procedure. When the selection is SECONDARY, destination_data
is an Atom representing a target recomm- mended by the
selection owner for use in converting the selection.
Otherwise, destination_data is NULL.</p>

<p>location_data Contains information about the location
where data is to be transferred. The value is always NULL
when the selection is CLIPBOARD. If the value is NULL, the
data is to be inserted at the widgets cursor position.
Otherwise, the value is a pointer to an XPoint structure
containing the x- and y- coor- dinates at the location where
the data is to be transferred. Once XmTransferDone
procedures start to be called, loca- tion_data will no
longer be stable.</p>

<p>time Indicates the time when the transfer operation
began.</p>

<p>Translations The XmText translations are described in
the following list. The actions represent the effective
behavior of the associated events, and they may differ in a
right-to-left language environment.</p>

<p>The following key names are listed in the X standard key
event translation table syntax. This format is the one used
by Motif to specify the widget actions corresponding to a
given key. A brief overview of the format is provided under
VirtualBindings(3). For a complete description of the
format, please refer to the X Toolkit Instrinsics
Documentation.</p>

<p>The Text button event translations are modified when
Displays XmNen- ableBtn1Transfer resource does not have a
value of XmOFF (in other words, it is either
XmBUTTON2_TRANSFER or XmBUTTON2_ADJUST). This option allows
the actions for selection and transfer to be integrated on
&lt;Btn1&gt;, and the actions for extending the selection
can be bound to &lt;Btn2&gt;. The actions for &lt;Btn1&gt;
that are defined above still apply when the &lt;Btn1&gt;
event occurs over text that is not selected. The following
actions apply when the &lt;Btn1&gt; event occurs over text
that is selected:</p>

<p>&lt;Btn1Down&gt;: process-bdrag().</p>

<p>&lt;Shift&gt;&lt;Btn1Down&gt;: process-bdrag().</p>

<p>&lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;Btn1Down&gt;: process-bdrag().</p>

<p>&lt;Btn1Down&gt;&lt;Shift&gt;&lt;Btn1Up&gt;:
grab-focus(), extend-end.</p>


<p>&lt;Shift&gt;&lt;Btn1Down&gt;&lt;Shift&gt;&lt;Btn1Up&gt;:
extend-start(), extend-end().</p>


<p>&lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;Btn1Down&gt;&lt;Shift&gt;&lt;Btn1Up&gt;:
move-destination().</p>

<p>When Displays XmNenableBtn1Transfer resource has a value
of XmBUT- TON2_ADJUST, the following actions apply:</p>

<p>&lt;Btn2Down&gt;: extend-start().</p>

<p>&lt;Btn2Motion&gt;: extend-adjust().</p>

<p>&lt;Btn2Up&gt;: extend-end().</p>

<p>Action Routines The XmText action routines are</p>

<p>activate(): Calls the callbacks for XmNactivateCallback.
Passes the event to the parent.</p>

<p>backward-character(extend): Moves the insertion cursor
one character to the left. This action may have different
behavior in a right-to-left lan- guage environment.</p>

<p>If called with an argument of extend, moves the
insertion cursor as in the case of no argument and extends
the current selection.</p>

<p>The backward-character() action produces calls to the
XmNmo- tionVerifyCallback procedures with reason value
XmCR_MOV- ING_INSERT_CURSOR. If called with the extend
argument, the backward-character() action may produce calls
to the XmNgain- PrimaryCallback procedures. See callback
description for more information.</p>

<p>In vertical writing, if XmNeditMode is
XmSINGLE_LINE_EDIT and XmNnavigationType is XmNONE,
traverses to the widget to the left in the tab group. If
XmNeditMode is XmMULTI_LINE_EDIT, moves the insertion cursor
to the next line in the same col- umn.</p>

<p>backward-paragraph(extend): If XmNeditMode is
XmMULTI_LINE_EDIT and this action is called with no
argument, moves the insertion cursor to the first
non-whitespace character following the first previous blank
line or beginning of the text. If the insertion cursor is
already at the beginning of a paragraph, moves the insertion
cursor to the beginning of the previous paragraph.</p>

<p>If XmNeditMode is XmMULTI_LINE_EDIT and this action is
called with an argument of extend, moves the insertion
cursor as in the case of no argument and extends the current
selection.</p>

<p>The backward-paragraph() action produces calls to the
XmNmo- tionVerifyCallback procedures with reason value
XmCR_MOV- ING_INSERT_CURSOR. If called with the extend
argument, the backward-paragraph() action may produce calls
to the XmNgain- PrimaryCallback procedures. See callback
description for more information.</p>

<p>backward-word(extend): If this action is called with no
argument, moves the inser- tion cursor to the first
non-whitespace character after the first whitespace
character to the left or after the beginning of the line. If
the insertion cursor is already at the beginning of a word,
moves the insertion cursor to the begin- ning of the
previous word. This action may have different behavior in a
locale other than the C locale.</p>

<p>If called with an argument of extend, moves the
insertion cursor as in the case of no argument and extends
the current selection.</p>

<p>The backward-word() action produces calls to the
XmNmotion- VerifyCallback procedures with reason value
XmCR_MOV- ING_INSERT_CURSOR. If called with the extend
argument, the backward-word() action may produce calls to
the XmNgainPrima- ryCallback procedures. See callback
description for more information.</p>

<p>beep(): Causes the terminal to beep. The beep() action
produces no callbacks.</p>

<p>beginning-of-file(extend): If this action is called with
no argument, moves the inser- tion cursor to the beginning
of the text.</p>

<p>If called with an argument of extend, moves the
insertion cursor as in the case of no argument and extends
the current selection.</p>

<p>The beginning-of-file() action produces calls to the
XmNmo- tionVerifyCallback procedures with reason value
XmCR_MOV- ING_INSERT_CURSOR. If called with the extend
argument, the beginning-of-file() action may produce calls
to the XmNgain- PrimaryCallback procedures. See callback
description for more information.</p>

<p>beginning-of-line(extend): If this action is called with
no argument, moves the inser- tion cursor to the beginning
of the line.</p>

<p>If called with an argument of extend, moves the
insertion cursor as in the case of no argument and extends
the current selection.</p>

<p>The beginning-of-line() action produces calls to the
XmNmo- tionVerifyCallback procedures with reason value
XmCR_MOV- ING_INSERT_CURSOR. If called with the extend
argument, the beginning-of-line() action may produce calls
to the XmNgain- PrimaryCallback procedures. See callback
description for more information.</p>

<p>clear-selection(): Clears the current selection by
replacing each character except &lt;Return&gt; with a
&lt;space&gt; character.</p>

<p>The clear-selection() action produces calls to the
XmNmodi- fyVerifyCallback procedures with reason value
XmCR_MODIFY- ING_TEXT_VALUE and the XmNvalueChangedCallback
procedures with reason value XmCR_VALUE_CHANGED.</p>

<p>copy-clipboard(): If this widget owns the primary
selection, this action copies the selection to the

description for more information.</p>

<p>grab-focus(): This key binding performs the action
defined in the XmNselec- tionArray, depending on the number
of multiple mouse clicks. The default selection array
ordering is one click to move the insertion cursor to the
pointer position, two clicks to select a word, three clicks
to select a line of text, and four clicks to select all
text. A single click also dese- lects any selected text and
sets the anchor at the pointer position. This action may
have different behavior in a locale other than the C
locale.</p>

empty string, no callbacks will be called, since no
modification will have been done. How- ever, if the
insertion position is inside the current selec- tion,
insert-string with an empty string will cause the selection
to be deselected, and the XmNmotionVerifyCallback procedures
to be called with reason value XmCR_MOV- ING_INSERT_CURSOR,
XmCR_MODIFYING_TEXT_VALUE, and XmCR_VALUE_CHANGED.</p>

<p>key-select(right|left): If called with an argument of
right, moves the insertion cur- sor one character to the
right and extends the current selec- tion. If called with an

to the left and extends the current selection. If called
with no argument, extends the current selection.</p>

<p>Note that after a key-select action, the selection will
still begin at the original anchor, and will extend to the
position indicated in the action call. If this new position
is on the opposite side of the selection anchor from the
previous selection boundary, the original selection will be
dese- lected.</p>

XmNgainPrima- ryCallback procedures. See callback
description for more information.</p>

<p>paste-clipboard(): Pastes the contents of the clipboard
before the insertion cursor. This action calls the
XmNdestinationCallback proce- dures for the CLIPBOARD
selection and the XmCOPY operation.</p>

<p>The paste-clipboard() action produces calls to the
XmNmodi- fyVerifyCallback procedures with reason value
XmCR_MODIFY- ING_TEXT_VALUE, the XmNvalueChangedCallback
procedures with reason value XmCR_VALUE_CHANGED, and the
XmNmotionVerifyCall- back procedures with reason value
XmCR_MOVING_INSERT_CURSOR.</p>

<p>prev-tab-group(): Traverses to the previous tab
group.</p>

<p>The prev-tab-group() action produces no callbacks,
unless it results in the widget losing focus, in which case,
the XmN- losingFocusCallback procedures are called with
reason value XmCR_LOSING_FOCUS.</p>

<p>previous-line(): Moves the insertion cursor to the
previous line.</p>

<p>The previous-line() action produces calls to the
XmNmotion- VerifyCallback procedures with reason value
XmCR_MOV- ING_INSERT_CURSOR.</p>

<p>previous-page(extend): If XmNeditMode is
XmMULTI_LINE_EDIT and this action is called with no
argument, moves the insertion cursor back one page.</p>

<p>If XmNeditMode is XmMULTI_LINE_EDIT and this action is
called with an argument of extend, it moves the insertion
cursor as in the case of no argument and extends the current
selection.</p>

<p>The previous-page() action produces calls to the
XmNmotion- VerifyCallback procedures with reason value
XmCR_MOV- ING_INSERT_CURSOR. If called with the extend
argument, the previous-page() action may produce calls to
the XmNgainPrima- ryCallback procedures. See callback
description for more information.</p>

<p>In vertical writing, if called without an argument,
scrolls the viewing window up one page of text.</p>

<p>process-bdrag() If the pointer is within the selection,
this action starts a drag operation for the selection. This
action sets the XmN- convertProc of the DragContext to a
function that calls the XmNconvertCallback procedures,
possibly multiple times, for the _MOTIF_DROP selection.</p>

<p>If no selection exists or the pointer is outside the
selec- tion, this action prepares to start a secondary
selection at the pointer position.</p>

<p>Note:</p>

<p>Note that when dragging a secondary selection to a
different widget, focus will shift momentarily to the second
widget, and then back to the original widget. This will
generate callbacks to the XmNlosingFocus- Callback
procedures as focus is lost (by each widget) as well as
callbacks to the XmNfocusCallback proce- dures as focus is
regained.</p>

<p>process-cancel(): Cancels the current extend-adjust(),
secondary-adjust() or process-bdrag() operation and leaves
the selection state as it was before the operation;
otherwise, and if the parent is a manager, passes the event
to the parent.</p>

<p>process-down(extend): If XmNeditMode is
XmSINGLE_LINE_EDIT, and XmNnavigationType is XmNONE,
traverses to the widget below the current one in the tab
group.</p>

<p>If XmNeditMode is XmMULTI_LINE_EDIT and this action is
called with an argument of extend, moves the insertion
cursor as in the case of no argument and extends the current
selection.</p>

<p>In this case, the action will produce the
XmNlosingFocusCall- back callbacks with reason value
XmCR_LOSING_FOCUS.</p>

<p>If XmNeditMode is XmMULTI_LINE_EDIT, moves the insertion
cur- sor down one line.</p>

<p>The process-down() action produces calls to the
XmNmotionVer- ifyCallback procedures with reason value
XmCR_MOV- ING_INSERT_CURSOR.</p>

<p>In vertical writing, moves the insertion cursor one
character down.</p>

<p>process-home(): Moves the insertion cursor to the
beginning of the line.</p>

<p>The process-home() action produces calls to the
XmNmotionVer- ifyCallback procedures with reason value
XmCR_MOV- ING_INSERT_CURSOR.</p>

<p>process-return(): If XmNeditMode is XmSINGLE_LINE_EDIT,
calls the callbacks for XmNactivateCallback, and if the
parent is a manager, passes the event to the parent. If
XmNeditMode is XmMULTI_LINE_EDIT, inserts a newline.</p>

<p>The process-return() action during single-line edit
produces calls to the XmNactivateCallback procedures with
reason value XmCR_ACTIVATE. During multi-line editing, the
process- return() action produces calls to the
XmNmodifyVerifyCallback procedures with reason value
XmCR_MODIFYING_TEXT_VALUE, the XmNvalueChangedCallback
procedures with reason value XmCR_VALUE_CHANGED, and the
XmNmotionVerifyCallback proce- dures with reason value
XmCR_MOVING_INSERT_CURSOR.</p>

<p>process-shift-down(): If XmNeditMode is
XmMULTI_LINE_EDIT, moves the insertion cur- sor down one
line and selects. If XmNeditMode is XmSIN- GLE_LINE_EDIT,
this action behaves like process-up() in XmS-
INGLE_LINE_EDIT. Refer to the process-up() action.</p>

<p>The process-shift-down() action produces calls to the
XmNmo- tionVerifyCallback procedures with reason value
XmCR_MOV- ING_INSERT_CURSOR.</p>

<p>In vertical writing, if called with the argument up,
moves the insertion cursor one character up and extends the
current selection. If called with the argument down, moves
the inser- tion cursor one character down and extends the
current selec- tion.</p>

<p>process-shift-up(): If XmNeditMode is XmMULTI_LINE_EDIT,
moves the insertion cur- sor up one line and selects. If
XmNeditMode is XmSIN- GLE_LINE_EDIT, this action behaves
like process-up() in XmS- INGLE_LINE_EDIT. Refer to the
process-up() action.</p>

<p>The process-shift-up() action produces calls to the
XmNmo- tionVerifyCallback procedures with reason value
XmCR_MOV- ING_INSERT_CURSOR.</p>

<p>In vertical writing, if called with the argument up,
moves the insertion cursor one character up and extends the
current selection. If called with the argument down, moves
the inser- tion cursor one character down and extends the
current selec- tion.</p>

<p>process-tab(Prev|Next): If XmNeditMode is
XmSINGLE_LINE_EDIT, traverses to the next tab group if the
direction argument is Next, or to the previ- ous tab group
if the direction is Prev. If XmNeditMode is
XmMULTI_LINE_EDIT, and the direction is Next, the action
inserts a tab. The Prev direction has no effect with
XmMULTI_LINE_EDIT. In the Text widget, there is a preset tab
stop at every eighth columns.</p>

<p>The process-tab() action under multi-line editing
produces calls to the XmNmotionVerifyCallback procedures
with reason value XmCR_MOVING_INSERT_CURSOR. Under
single-line editing, the action produces no callbacks,
unless it results in the widget losing focus, in which case,
the XmNlosingFocusCall- back procedures are called with
reason value XmCR_LOS- ING_FOCUS.</p>

<p>process-up(extend): If XmNeditMode is XmSINGLE_LINE_EDIT
and XmNnavigationType is XmNONE, traverses to the widget
above the current one in the tab group.</p>

<p>If XmNeditMode is XmMULTI_LINE_EDIT, moves the insertion
cur- sor up one line.</p>

<p>If XmNeditMode is XmMULTI_LINE_EDIT and this action is
called with an argument of extend, moves the insertion
cursor as in the case of no argument and extends the current
selection.</p>

<p>The process-up() action under multi-line editing
produces calls to the XmNmotionVerifyCallback procedures
with reason value XmCR_MOVING_INSERT_CURSOR. Under
single-line editing, the action produces no callbacks unless
it results in the widget losing focus, in which case, the
XmNlosingFocusCall- back procedures are called with reason
value XmCR_LOS- ING_FOCUS.</p>

<p>In vertical writing, moves the insertion cursor one
character up.</p>

<p>redraw-display(): Redraws the contents of the text
window.</p>

<p>The redraw-display() action produces no callbacks.</p>

<p>scroll-cursor-vertically(percentage): Scrolls the line
containing the insertion cursor vertically to an
intermediate position in the visible window based on an
input percentage. A value of 0 indicates the top of the win-
dow; a value of 100, the bottom of the window. If this
action is called with no argument, the line containing the
insertion cursor is scrolled vertically to a new position
designated by the y position of the event passed to the
routine.</p>

<p>The scroll-cursor-vertically action produces no
callbacks.</p>

<p>scroll-one-line-down(): Scrolls the text area down one
line.</p>

<p>The scroll-one-line-down() action produces no
callbacks.</p>

<p>scroll-one-line-up(): Scrolls the text area up one
line.</p>

the insertion cursor of the destination widget.</p>

<p>The secondary-notify() action produces calls to the
XmNmodi- fyVerifyCallback procedures with reason value
XmCR_MODIFY- ING_TEXT_VALUE, and the XmNvalueChangedCallback
procedures with reason value XmCR_VALUE_CHANGED.</p>

<p>secondary-start(): Marks the beginning of a secondary
selection.</p>

<p>The secondary-start() action produces no callbacks.</p>

<p>select-adjust(): Moves the current selection. The amount
of text selected depends on the number of mouse clicks, as
specified by the XmNselectionArray resource.</p>

<p>The select-adjust() action may produce no callbacks,
however, it may produce calls to the XmNgainPrimaryCallback
proce- dures. See callback description for more
information.</p>

<p>select-all(): Selects all text.</p>

<p>The select-all() action may produce calls to the
XmNgainPri- maryCallback procedures.</p>

<p>select-end(): Moves the current selection. The amount of
text selected depends on the number of mouse clicks, as
specified by the XmNselectionArray resource.</p>

<p>The select-end() action produces no callbacks.</p>

<p>select-start(): Marks the beginning of a new selection
region.</p>

<p>The select-start() action may produce calls to the
XmNgain- PrimaryCallback procedures.</p>

<p>self-insert(): If XmNpendingDelete is True and the
cursor is not disjoint from the current selection, deletes
the entire selection. Inserts the character associated with
the key pressed at the insertion cursor.</p>

<p>The self-insert() action produces calls to the

the position of the mouse pointer.</p>

<p>The set-insertion-point() action produces calls to the
XmNmo- tionVerifyCallback procedures with reason value
XmCR_MOV- ING_INSERT_CURSOR. Note that if the mouse pointer
is already over the position of the insertion cursor, the
cursor will not be moved, and no callbacks will be
produced.</p>

<p>set-selection-hint(): Sets the text source and location
of the current selection.</p>

<p>The set-selection-hint() action produces no
callbacks.</p>

<p>toggle-add-mode(): Toggles the state of Add Mode.</p>

<p>The toggle-add-mode() action produces no callbacks.</p>

<p>toggle-overstrike(): Toggles the state of the text
insertion mode. By default, characters typed into the Text
widget are inserted at the position of the insertion cursor.
In overstrike mode, charac- ters entered into the Text
widget replace the characters that directly follow the
insertion cursor. In overstrike mode, when the end of a line
is reached, characters are appended to the end of the
line.</p>

<p>The following traversal actions generate no callbacks
unless they result in the loss of focus by the widget in
question, as when XmNnavigationType is XmNONE. In this case,
they pro- duce calls to the XmNlosingFocusCallback
procedures, with reason value XmCR_FOCUS_MOVED.</p>

<p>traverse-home(): Traverses to the first widget in the
tab group.</p>
