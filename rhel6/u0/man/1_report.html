<p>NAME report - Report library frontend</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS report [options] file</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION report will deliver file to a target. A
target can be specified on the command line, in the [main]
section of the report configuration files, or it will be
queried. Each target is associated with a plugin which
actually delivers the file. Additional parameters needed by
the plugin are plugin specific, and may be specified on the
command line, in tar- get specific configuration sections,
or they will be queried.</p>

<p>The file can be a specifically formatted problem report
or an arbitrary file. A target can be ticket/case/bug
tracking systems, in which case report can create new
tickets or attach to existing ones; or a target can be a
simple directory on local or remote file systems.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --target Specify the target. This must be one of
the targets configured in /etc/report.d/*.conf.</p>

<p>--ticket Specify a ticket or case or bug to the plugin
specified by the target. This option is only valid for
plugins that deal in cases, tickets or bugs; it is ignored
by other plugins. If the target config file also defines a
ticket configuration, the command line overrides this.</p>

<p>--host Specify a host or case or bug to the plugin
specified by the target. This option is only valid for
plugins that deal in hosts; it is ignored by other plugins.
If the target config file also defines a host configuration,
the command line over- rides this.</p>

<p>--path Specify a path or case or bug to the plugin
specified by the target. This option is only valid for
plugins that deal in paths; it is ignored by other plugins.
If the target config file also defines a path configuration,
the command line over- rides this.</p>

<p>--gtk Use GTK dialog boxes for I/O from the Report
library.</p>

<p>-h</p>

<p>--help Command line help.</p>
