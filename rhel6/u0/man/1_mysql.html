<p>MYSQL(1) MySQL Database System MYSQL(1)</p>

<p>NAME mysql - the MySQL command-line tool</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS mysql [options] db_name</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION mysql is a simple SQL shell (with GNU
readline capabilities). It supports interactive and
noninteractive use. When used interactively, query results
are presented in an ASCII-table format. When used
noninteractively (for example, as a filter), the result is
presented in tab-separated format. The output format can be
changed using command options.</p>

<p>If you have problems due to insufficient memory for
large result sets, use the --quick option. This forces mysql
to retrieve results from the server a row at a time rather
than retrieving the entire result set and buffering it in
memory before displaying it. This is done by returning the
result set using the mysql_use_result() C API function in
the client/server library rather than
mysql_store_result().</p>

<p>Using mysql is very easy. Invoke it from the prompt of
your command interpreter as follows:</p>

<p>shell&gt; mysql db_name</p>

<p>Or:</p>

<p>shell&gt; mysql --user=user_name
--password=your_password db_name</p>

<p>Then type an SQL statement, end it with ;, or G and
press Enter.</p>

<p>As of MySQL 5.1.10, typing Control-C causes mysql to
attempt to kill the current statement. If this cannot be
done, or Control-C is typed again before the statement is
killed, mysql exits. Previously, Control-C caused mysql to
exit in all cases.</p>

<p>You can execute SQL statements in a script file (batch
file) like this:</p>

<p>shell&gt; mysql db_name &lt; script.sql &gt;
output.tab</p>

<p>MYSQL OPTIONS mysql supports the following options,
which can be specified on the command line or in the [mysql]
and [client] option file groups. mysql also supports the
options for processing option files described at Section
4.2.3.3.1, Command-Line Options that Affect Option-File
Handling.</p>

<p>&middot; --help, -?</p>

<p>Display a help message and exit.</p>

<p>&middot; --auto-rehash</p>

<p>Enable automatic rehashing. This option is on by
default, which enables database, table, and column name
completion. Use --disable-auto-rehash to disable rehashing.
That causes mysql to start faster, but you must issue the
rehash command if you want to use name completion.</p>

<p>To complete a name, enter the first part and press Tab.
If the name is unambiguous, mysql completes it. Otherwise,
you can press Tab again to see the possible names that begin
with what you have typed so far. Completion does not occur
if there is no default database.</p>

<p>&middot; --batch, -B</p>

<p>Print results using tab as the column separator, with
each row on a new line. With this option, mysql does not use
the history file.</p>

<p>Batch mode results in nontabular output format and
escaping of special characters. Escaping may be disabled by
using raw mode; see the description for the --raw
option.</p>

<p>&middot; --character-sets-dir=path</p>

<p>The directory where character sets are installed. See
Section 9.5, Character Set Configuration.</p>

<p>&middot; --column-names</p>

<p>Write column names in results.</p>

<p>&middot; --column-type-info, -m</p>

<p>Display result set metadata. This option was added in
MySQL 5.1.14. (Before that, use --debug-info.) The -m short
option was added in MySQL 5.1.21.</p>

<p>&middot; --comments, -c</p>

<p>Whether to preserve comments in statements sent to the
server. The default is --skip-comments (discard comments),
enable with --comments (preserve comments). This option was
added in MySQL 5.1.23.</p>

<p>&middot; --compress, -C</p>

<p>Compress all information sent between the client and the
server if both support compression.</p>

<p>&middot; --database=db_name, -D db_name</p>

<p>The database to use. This is useful primarily in an
option file.</p>

<p>&middot; --debug[=debug_options], -# [debug_options]</p>

<p>Write a debugging log. A typical debug_options string is
&acute;d:t:o,file_name&acute;. The default is
&acute;d:t:o,/tmp/mysql.trace&acute;.</p>

<p>&middot; --debug-check</p>

<p>Print some debugging information when the program exits.
This option was added in MySQL 5.1.21.</p>

<p>&middot; --debug-info, -T</p>

<p>Before MySQL 5.1.14, this option prints debugging
information and memory and CPU usage statistics when the
program exits, and also causes display of result set
metadata during execution. As of MySQL 5.1.14, use
--column-type-info to display result set metadata.</p>

<p>&middot; --default-character-set=charset_name</p>

<p>Use charset_name as the default character set for the
client and connection.</p>

<p>A common issue that can occur when the operating system
uses utf8 or another multi-byte character set is that output
from the mysql client is formatted incorrectly, due to the
fact that the MySQL client uses the latin1 character set by
default. You can usually fix such issues by using this
option to force the client to use the system character set
instead.</p>

<p>See Section 9.5, Character Set Configuration, for more
information.</p>

<p>&middot; --delimiter=str</p>

<p>Set the statement delimiter. The default is the
semicolon character (;).</p>

<p>&middot; --disable-named-commands</p>

<p>Disable named commands. Use the form only, or use named
commands only at the beginning of a line ending with a
semicolon (;). mysql starts with this option enabled by
default. However, even with this option, long-format
commands still work from the first line. See the section
called MYSQL COMMANDS.</p>

<p>&middot; --execute=statement, -e statement</p>

<p>Execute the statement and quit. The default output
format is like that produced with --batch. See Section
4.2.3.1, Using Options on the Command Line, for some
examples.</p>

<p>&middot; --force, -f</p>

<p>Continue even if an SQL error occurs.</p>

<p>&middot; --host=host_name, -h host_name</p>

<p>Connect to the MySQL server on the given host.</p>

<p>&middot; --html, -H</p>

<p>Produce HTML output.</p>

<p>&middot; --ignore-spaces, -i</p>

<p>Ignore spaces after function names. The effect of this
is described in the discussion for the IGNORE_SPACE SQL mode
(see Section 5.1.7, Server SQL Modes).</p>

<p>&middot; --line-numbers</p>

<p>Write line numbers for errors. Disable this with
--skip-line-numbers.</p>

<p>&middot; --local-infile[={0|1}]</p>

<p>Enable or disable LOCAL capability for LOAD DATA INFILE.
With no value, the option enables LOCAL. The option may be
given as --local-infile=0 or --local-infile=1 to explicitly
disable or enable LOCAL. Enabling LOCAL has no effect if the
server does not also support it.</p>

<p>&middot; --named-commands, -G</p>

<p>Enable named mysql commands. Long-format commands are
allowed, not just short-format commands. For example, quit
and q both are recognized. Use --skip-named-commands to
disable named commands. See the section called MYSQL
COMMANDS.</p>

<p>&middot; --no-auto-rehash, -A</p>

<p>This has the same effect as -skip-auto-rehash. See the
description for --auto-rehash.</p>

<p>&middot; --no-beep, -b</p>

<p>Do not beep when errors occur.</p>

<p>&middot; --no-named-commands, -g</p>

<p>Deprecated, use --disable-named-commands instead.
--no-named-commands is removed in MySQL 5.5.</p>

<p>&middot; --no-pager</p>

<p>Deprecated form of --skip-pager. See the --pager option.
--no-pager is removed in MySQL 5.5.</p>

<p>&middot; --no-tee</p>

<p>Deprecated form of --skip-tee. See the --tee option.
--no-tee is removed in MySQL 5.5.</p>

<p>&middot; --one-database, -o</p>

<p>Ignore statements except those for the default database
named on the command line. This is useful for skipping
updates to other databases in the binary log.</p>

<p>&middot; --pager[=command]</p>

<p>Use the given command for paging query output. If the
command is omitted, the default pager is the value of your
PAGER environment variable. Valid pagers are less, more, cat
[&gt; filename], and so forth. This option works only on
Unix and only in interactive mode. To disable paging, use
--skip-pager. the section called MYSQL COMMANDS, discusses
output paging further.</p>

<p>&middot; --password[=password], -p[password]</p>

<p>The password to use when connecting to the server. If
you use the short option form (-p), you cannot have a space
between the option and the password. If you omit the
password value following the --password or -p option on the
command line, mysql prompts for one.</p>

<p>Specifying a password on the command line should be
considered insecure. See Section 5.3.2.2, End-User
Guidelines for Password Security . You can use an option
file to avoid giving the password on the command line.</p>

<p>&middot; --pipe, -W</p>

<p>On Windows, connect to the server via a named pipe. This
option applies only if the server supports named-pipe
connections.</p>

<p>&middot; --port=port_num, -P port_num</p>

<p>The TCP/IP port number to use for the connection.</p>

<p>&middot; --prompt=format_str</p>

<p>Set the prompt to the specified format. The default is
mysql&gt;. The special sequences that the prompt can contain
are described in the section called MYSQL COMMANDS.</p>

<p>&middot; --protocol={TCP|SOCKET|PIPE|MEMORY}</p>

<p>The connection protocol to use for connecting to the
server. It is useful when the other connection parameters
normally would cause a protocol to be used other than the
one you want. For details on the allowable values, see
Section 4.2.2, Connecting to the MySQL Server.</p>

<p>&middot; --quick, -q</p>

<p>Do not cache each query result, print each row as it is
received. This may slow down the server if the output is
suspended. With this option, mysql does not use the history
file.</p>

<p>&middot; --raw, -r</p>

<p>For tabular output, the boxing around columns enables
one column value to be distinguished from another. For
nontabular output (such as is produced in batch mode or when
the --batch or --silent option is given), special characters
are escaped in the output so they can be identified easily.
Newline, tab, NUL, and backslash are written as 0 , , and \.
The --raw option disables this character escaping.</p>

<p>The following example demonstrates tabular versus
nontabular output and the use of raw mode to disable
escaping:</p>

<p>% mysql mysql&gt; SELECT CHAR(92); +----------+ |
CHAR(92) | +----------+ | | +----------+ % mysql -s
mysql&gt; SELECT CHAR(92); CHAR(92) \ % mysql -s -r
mysql&gt; SELECT CHAR(92); CHAR(92)</p>

<p>&middot; --reconnect</p>

<p>If the connection to the server is lost, automatically
try to reconnect. A single reconnect attempt is made each
time the connection is lost. To suppress reconnection
behavior, use --skip-reconnect.</p>

<p>&middot; --safe-updates, --i-am-a-dummy, -U</p>

<p>Allow only those UPDATE and DELETE statements that
specify which rows to modify by using key values. If you
have set this option in an option file, you can override it
by using --safe-updates on the command line. See the section
called MYSQL TIPS, for more information about this
option.</p>

<p>&middot; --secure-auth</p>

<p>Do not send passwords to the server in old (pre-4.1.1)
format. This prevents connections except for servers that
use the newer password format.</p>

<p>&middot; --show-warnings</p>

<p>Cause warnings to be shown after each statement if there
are any. This option applies to interactive and batch
mode.</p>

<p>&middot; --sigint-ignore</p>

<p>Ignore SIGINT signals (typically the result of typing
Control-C).</p>

<p>&middot; --silent, -s</p>

<p>Silent mode. Produce less output. This option can be
given multiple times to produce less and less output.</p>

<p>This option results in nontabular output format and
escaping of special characters. Escaping may be disabled by
using raw mode; see the description for the --raw
option.</p>

<p>&middot; --skip-column-names, -N</p>

<p>Do not write column names in results.</p>

<p>&middot; --skip-line-numbers, -L</p>

<p>Do not write line numbers for errors. Useful when you
want to compare result files that include error
messages.</p>

<p>&middot; --socket=path, -S path</p>

<p>For connections to localhost, the Unix socket file to
use, or, on Windows, the name of the named pipe to use.</p>

<p>&middot; --ssl*</p>

<p>Options that begin with --ssl specify whether to connect
to the server via SSL and indicate where to find SSL keys
and certificates. See Section 5.5.6.3, SSL Command Options
.</p>

<p>&middot; --table, -t</p>

<p>Display output in table format. This is the default for
interactive use, but can be used to produce table output in
batch mode.</p>

<p>&middot; --tee=file_name</p>

<p>Append a copy of output to the given file. This option
works only in interactive mode. the section called MYSQL
COMMANDS, discusses tee files further.</p>

<p>&middot; --unbuffered, -n</p>

<p>Flush the buffer after each query.</p>

<p>&middot; --user=user_name, -u user_name</p>

<p>The MySQL user name to use when connecting to the
server.</p>

<p>&middot; --verbose, -v</p>

<p>Verbose mode. Produce more output about what the program
does. This option can be given multiple times to produce
more and more output. (For example, -v -v -v produces table
output format even in batch mode.)</p>

<p>&middot; --version, -V</p>

<p>Display version information and exit.</p>

<p>&middot; --vertical, -E</p>

<p>Print query output rows vertically (one line per column
value). Without this option, you can specify vertical output
for individual statements by terminating them with G.</p>

<p>&middot; --wait, -w</p>

<p>If the connection cannot be established, wait and retry
instead of aborting.</p>

<p>&middot; --xml, -X</p>

<p>Produce XML output.</p>

<p>Note Prior to MySQL 5.1.12, there was no differentiation
in the output when using this option between columns
containing the NULL value and columns containing the string
literal &acute;NULL&acute;; both were represented as</p>

<p>&lt;field
name=&quot;column_name&quot;&gt;NULL&lt;/field&gt;</p>

<p>Beginning with MySQL 5.1.12, the output when --xml is
used with mysql matches that of mysqldump --xml. See
mysqldump(1) for details.</p>

<p>Beginning with MySQL 5.1.18, the XML output also uses an
XML namespace, as shown here:</p>

<p>shell&gt; mysql --xml -uroot -e &quot;SHOW VARIABLES
LIKE &acute;version%&acute;&quot; &lt;?xml
version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt; &lt;resultset
statement=&quot;SHOW VARIABLES LIKE
&acute;version%&acute;&quot;
xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot;&gt;
&lt;row&gt; &lt;field
name=&quot;Variable_name&quot;&gt;version&lt;/field&gt;
&lt;field
name=&quot;Value&quot;&gt;5.0.40-debug&lt;/field&gt;
&lt;/row&gt; &lt;row&gt; &lt;field
name=&quot;Variable_name&quot;&gt;version_comment&lt;/field&gt;
&lt;field name=&quot;Value&quot;&gt;Source
distribution&lt;/field&gt; &lt;/row&gt; &lt;row&gt;
&lt;field
name=&quot;Variable_name&quot;&gt;version_compile_machine&lt;/field&gt;
&lt;field name=&quot;Value&quot;&gt;i686&lt;/field&gt;
&lt;/row&gt; &lt;row&gt; &lt;field
name=&quot;Variable_name&quot;&gt;version_compile_os&lt;/field&gt;
&lt;field
name=&quot;Value&quot;&gt;suse-linux-gnu&lt;/field&gt;
&lt;/row&gt; &lt;/resultset&gt;</p>

<p>(See Bug#25946[1].)</p>

<p>You can also set the following variables by using
--var_name=value. The --set-variable format is deprecated
and is removed in MySQL 5.5.</p>

<p>&middot; connect_timeout</p>

<p>The number of seconds before connection timeout.
(Default value is 0.)</p>

<p>&middot; max_allowed_packet</p>

<p>The maximum packet length to send to or receive from the
server. (Default value is 16MB.)</p>

<p>&middot; max_join_size</p>

<p>The automatic limit for rows in a join when using
--safe-updates. (Default value is 1,000,000.)</p>

<p>&middot; net_buffer_length</p>

<p>The buffer size for TCP/IP and socket communication.
(Default value is 16KB.)</p>

<p>&middot; select_limit</p>

<p>The automatic limit for SELECT statements when using
--safe-updates. (Default value is 1,000.)</p>

<p>On Unix, the mysql client writes a record of executed
statements to a history file. By default, this file is named
.mysql_history and is created in your home directory. To
specify a different file, set the value of the
MYSQL_HISTFILE environment variable.</p>

<p>The .mysql_history should be protected with a
restrictive access mode because sensitive information might
be written to it, such as the text of SQL statements that
contain passwords. See Section 5.3.2.2, End- User Guidelines
for Password Security.</p>

<p>If you do not want to maintain a history file, first
remove .mysql_history if it exists, and then use either of
the following techniques:</p>

<p>&middot; Set the MYSQL_HISTFILE variable to /dev/null.
To cause this setting to take effect each time you log in,
put the setting in one of your shell&acute;s startup
files.</p>

<p>&middot; Create .mysql_history as a symbolic link to
/dev/null:</p>

<p>shell&gt; ln -s /dev/null $HOME/.mysql_history</p>

<p>You need do this only once.</p>

<p>MYSQL COMMANDS mysql sends each SQL statement that you
issue to the server to be executed. There is also a set of
commands that mysql itself interprets. For a list of these
commands, type help or at the mysql&gt; prompt:</p>

<p>mysql&gt; help List of all MySQL commands: Note that all
text commands must be first on line and end with
&acute;;&acute; ? ( clear ( connect) Reconnect to the
server. Optional arguments are db and host. ( delimiter ()
Set statement delimiter. edit (\) Edit command with $EDITOR.
ego (G) Send command to mysql server, display result
vertically. exit (q) Exit mysql. Same as quit. go ( Send
command to mysql server. help ( Display this help. nopager
(0 Disable pager, print to stdout. notee () Don&acute;t
write into outfile. pager (P) Set PAGER [to_pager]. Print
the query results via PAGER. print () Print current command.
prompt ( Change your mysql prompt. quit (q) Quit mysql.
rehash ( source (.) Execute an SQL script file. Takes a file
name as an argument. status ( Get status information from
the server. system () Execute a system shell command. tee
(T) Set outfile [to_outfile]. Append everything into given
outfile. use () Use another database. Takes database name as
argument. charset (Switch to another charset. Might be
needed for processing binlog with multi-byte charsets.
warnings (W) Show warnings after every statement. nowarning
(1032 For server side help, type &acute;help
contents&acute;</p>

<p>Each command has both a long and short form. The long
form is not case sensitive; the short form is. The long form
can be followed by an optional semicolon terminator, but the
short form should not.</p>

<p>The use of short-form commands within multi-line /* ...
*/ comments is not supported.</p>

<p>&middot; help [arg], [arg], Display a help message
listing the available mysql commands.</p>

<p>If you provide an argument to the help command, mysql
uses it as a search string to access server-side help from
the contents of the MySQL Reference Manual. For more
information, see the section called MYSQL SERVER-SIDE
HELP.</p>

<p>&middot; charset charset_name,charset_name</p>

<p>Change the default character set and issue a SET NAMES
statement. This enables the character set to remain
synchronized on the client and server if mysql is run with
auto-reconnect enabled (which is not recommended), because
the specified character set is used for reconnects. This
command was added in MySQL 5.1.7.</p>

<p>&middot; clear, Clear the current input. Use this if you
change your mind about executing the statement that you are
entering.</p>

<p>r [db_name host_name]] &middot; connect [db_name
host_name]],</p>

<p>Reconnect to the server. The optional database name and
host name arguments may be given to specify the default
database or the host where the server is running. If
omitted, the current values are used.</p>

<p>&middot; delimiter strd str</p>

<p>Change the string that mysql interprets as the separator
between SQL statements. The default is the semicolon
character (;).</p>

<p>The delimiter can be specified as an unquoted or quoted
argument. Quoting can be done with either single quote
(&acute;) or douple quote (&quot;) characters. To include a
quote within a quoted string, either quote the string with
the other quote character or escape the quote with a
backslash () character. Backslash should be avoided outside
of quoted strings because it is the escape character for
MySQL. For an unquoted argument, the delmiter is read up to
the first space or end of line. For a quoted argument, the
delimiter is read up to the matching quote on the line.</p>

<p>When the delimiter recognized by mysql is set to
something other than the default of ;, instances of that
character are sent to the server without interpretation.
However, the server itself still interprets ; as a statement
delimiter and processes statements accordingly. This
behavior on the server side comes into play for
multiple-statement execution (see Section 21.9.12, C API
Support for Multiple Statement Execution), and for parsing
the body of stored procedures and functions, triggers, and
events (see Section 19.1, Defining Stored Programs).</p>

<p>&middot; edit,e</p>

<p>Edit the current input statement. mysql checks the
values of the EDITOR and VISUAL environment variables to
determine which editor to use. The default editor is vi if
neither variable is set.</p>

<p>The edit command works only in Unix.</p>

<p>&middot; ego,G</p>

<p>Send the current statement to the server to be executed
and display the result using vertical format.</p>

<p>&middot; exit,q</p>

<p>Exit mysql.</p>

<p>&middot; go,g</p>

<p>Send the current statement to the server to be
executed.</p>

<p>&middot; nopager,n</p>

<p>Disable output paging. See the description for
pager.</p>

<p>The nopager command works only in Unix.</p>

<p>&middot; noteet</p>

<p>Disable output copying to the tee file. See the
description for tee.</p>

<p>&middot; nowarning,24</p>

<p>Enable display of warnings after each statement.</p>

<p>&middot; pager [command],P [command]</p>

<p>Enable output paging. By using the --pager option when
you invoke mysql, it is possible to browse or search query
results in interactive mode with Unix programs such as less,
more, or any other similar program. If you specify no value
for the option, mysql checks the value of the PAGER
environment variable and sets the pager to that. Pager
functionality works only in interactive mode.</p>

<p>Output paging can be enabled interactively with the
pager command and disabled with nopager. The command takes
an optional argument; if given, the paging program is set to
that. With no argument, the pager is set to the pager that
was set on the command line, or stdout if no pager was
specified.</p>

<p>Output paging works only in Unix because it uses the
popen() function, which does not exist on Windows. For
Windows, the tee option can be used instead to save query
output, although it is not as convenient as pager for
browsing output in some situations.</p>

<p>&middot; print, p</p>

<p>Print the current input statement without executing
it.</p>

<p>&middot; prompt [str][str]</p>

<p>Reconfigure the mysql prompt to the given string. The
special character sequences that can be used in the prompt
are described later in this section.</p>

<p>If you specify the prompt command with no argument,
mysql resets the prompt to the default of mysql&gt;.</p>

<p>&middot; quit,q</p>

<p>Exit mysql.</p>

<p>&middot; rehash, Rebuild the completion hash that
enables database, table, and column name completion while
you are entering statements. (See the description for the
--auto-rehash option.)</p>

<p>&middot; source file_name,. file_name</p>

<p>Read the named file and executes the statements
contained therein. On Windows, you can specify path name
separators as / or \.</p>

<p>&middot; status,</p>

<p>Provide status information about the connection and the
server you are using. If you are running in --safe-updates
mode, status also prints the values for the mysql variables
that affect your queries.</p>

<p>&middot; system command! command</p>

<p>Execute the given command using your default command
interpreter.</p>

<p>The system command works only in Unix.</p>

<p>&middot; tee [file_name],T [file_name]</p>

<p>By using the --tee option when you invoke mysql, you can
log statements and their output. All the data displayed on
the screen is appended into a given file. This can be very
useful for debugging purposes also. mysql flushes results to
the file after each statement, just before it prints its
next prompt. Tee functionality works only in interactive
mode.</p>

<p>You can enable this feature interactively with the tee
command. Without a parameter, the previous file is used. The
tee file can be disabled with the notee command. Executing
tee again re-enables logging.</p>

<p>&middot; use db_nameu db_name</p>

<p>Use db_name as the default database.</p>

<p>&middot; warnings,W</p>

<p>Enable display of warnings after each statement (if
there are any).</p>

<p>Here are a few tips about the pager command:</p>

<p>&middot; You can use it to write to a file and the
results go only to the file:</p>

<p>mysql&gt; pager cat &gt; /tmp/log.txt</p>

<p>You can also pass any options for the program that you
want to use as your pager:</p>

<p>mysql&gt; pager less -n -i -S</p>

<p>&middot; In the preceding example, note the -S option.
You may find it very useful for browsing wide query results.
Sometimes a very wide result set is difficult to read on the
screen. The -S option to less can make the result set much
more readable because you can scroll it horizontally using
the left-arrow and right-arrow keys. You can also use -S
interactively within less to switch the horizontal-browse
mode on and off. For more information, read the less manual
page:</p>

<p>shell&gt; man less</p>

<p>&middot; The -F and -X options may be used with less to
cause it to exit if output fits on one screen, which is
convenient when no scrolling is necessary:</p>

<p>mysql&gt; pager less -n -i -S -F -X</p>

<p>&middot; You can specify very complex pager commands for
handling query output:</p>

<p>mysql&gt; pager cat | tee /dr1/tmp/res.txt | tee
/dr2/tmp/res2.txt | less -n -i -S</p>

<p>In this example, the command would send query results to
two files in two different directories on two different file
systems mounted on /dr1 and /dr2, yet still display the
results onscreen via less.</p>

<p>You can also combine the tee and pager functions. Have a
tee file enabled and pager set to less, and you are able to
browse the results using the less program and still have
everything appended into a file the same time. The
difference between the Unix tee used with the pager command
and the mysql built-in tee command is that the built-in tee
works even if you do not have the Unix tee available. The
built-in tee also logs everything that is printed on the
screen, whereas the Unix tee used with pager does not log
quite that much. Additionally, tee file logging can be
turned on and off interactively from within mysql. This is
useful when you want to log some queries to a file, but not
others.</p>

<p>The prompt command reconfigures the default mysql&gt;
prompt. The string for defining the prompt can contain the
following special sequences.</p>

<p>+-------+----------------------------+ |Option |
Description | +-------+----------------------------+ | | |
for each statement you | | | issue |

<p>You can set the prompt in several ways:</p>

<p>&middot; Use an environment variable. You can set the
MYSQL_PS1 environment variable to a prompt string. For
example:</p>

<p>shell&gt; export MYSQL_PS1=&quot;u) d]&gt; &quot;</p>

<p>&middot; Use a command-line option. You can set the
--prompt option on the command line to mysql. For
example:</p>

<p>shell&gt; mysql --prompt=&quot;u) d]&gt; &quot;
(user@host) [database]&gt;</p>

<p>&middot; Use an option file. You can set the prompt
option in the [mysql] group of any MySQL option file, such
as /etc/my.cnf or the .my.cnf file in your home directory.
For example:</p>

<p>[mysql] prompt=(\u@\h) [\d]&gt;\_</p>

<p>In this example, note that the backslashes are doubled.
If you set the prompt using the prompt option in an option
file, it is advisable to double the backslashes when using
the special prompt options. There is some overlap in the set
of allowable prompt options and the set of special escape
sequences that are recognized in option files. (The rules
for escape sequences in option files are listed in Section
4.2.3.3, Using Option Files .) The overlap may cause you
problems if you use single backslashes. For example, is
interpreted as a space rather than as the current seconds
value. The following example shows how to define a prompt
within an option file to include the current time in
HH:MM:SS&gt; format:</p>

<p>[mysql] prompt=&quot;\r:\m:\s&gt; &quot;</p>

<p>&middot; Set the prompt interactively. You can change
your prompt interactively by using the prompt (or command.
For example:</p>

<p>mysql&gt; prompt u) d]_ PROMPT set to &acute;(@
[]&gt;_&acute; (user@host) [database]&gt; (user@host)
[database]&gt; prompt Returning to default PROMPT of
mysql&gt; mysql&gt;</p>

<p>MYSQL SERVER-SIDE HELP mysql&gt; help search_string</p>

<p>If you provide an argument to the help command, mysql
uses it as a search string to access server-side help from
the contents of the MySQL Reference Manual. The proper
operation of this command requires that the help tables in
the mysql database be initialized with help topic
information (see Section 5.1.8, Server-Side Help).</p>

<p>If there is no match for the search string, the search
fails:</p>

<p>mysql&gt; help me Nothing found Please try to run
&acute;help contents&acute; for a list of all accessible
topics</p>

<p>Use help contents to see a list of the help
categories:</p>

<p>mysql&gt; help contents You asked for help about help
category: &quot;Contents&quot; For more information, type
&acute;help &lt;item&gt;&acute;, where &lt;item&gt; is one
of the following categories: Account Management
Administration Data Definition Data Manipulation Data Types
Functions Functions and Modifiers for Use with GROUP BY
Geographic Features Language Structure Plugins Storage
Engines Stored Routines Table Maintenance Transactions
Triggers</p>

<p>If the search string matches multiple items, mysql shows
a list of matching topics:</p>

<p>mysql&gt; help logs Many help items for your request
exist. To make a more specific request, please type
&acute;help &lt;item&gt;&acute;, where &lt;item&gt; is one
of the following topics: SHOW SHOW BINARY LOGS SHOW ENGINE
SHOW LOGS</p>

<p>Use a topic as the search string to see the help entry
for that topic:</p>

<p>mysql&gt; help show binary logs Name: &acute;SHOW BINARY
LOGS&acute; Description: Syntax: SHOW BINARY LOGS SHOW
MASTER LOGS Lists the binary log files on the server. This
statement is used as part of the procedure described in
[purge-binary-logs], that shows how to determine which logs
can be purged. mysql&gt; SHOW BINARY LOGS;

<p>EXECUTING SQL STATEMENTS FROM A TEXT FILE The mysql
client typically is used interactively, like this:</p>

<p>shell&gt; mysql db_name</p>

<p>However, it is also possible to put your SQL statements
in a file and then tell mysql to read its input from that
file. To do so, create a text file text_file that contains
the statements you wish to execute. Then invoke mysql as
shown here:</p>

<p>shell&gt; mysql db_name &lt; text_file</p>

<p>If you place a USE db_name statement as the first
statement in the file, it is unnecessary to specify the
database name on the command line:</p>

<p>shell&gt; mysql &lt; text_file</p>

<p>If you are already running mysql, you can execute an SQL
script file using the source command or . command:</p>

<p>mysql&gt; source file_name mysql&gt;. file_name</p>

<p>Sometimes you may want your script to display progress
information to the user. For this you can insert statements
like this:</p>

<p>SELECT &acute;&lt;info_to_display&gt;&acute; AS &acute;
&acute;;</p>

<p>The statement shown outputs &lt;info_to_display&gt;.</p>

<p>You can also invoke mysql with the --verbose option,
which causes each statement to be displayed before the
result that it produces.</p>

<p>As of MySQL 5.1.23, mysql ignores Unicode byte order
mark (BOM) characters at the beginning of input files.
Previously, it read them and sent them to the server,
resulting in a syntax error. Presence of a BOM does not
cause mysql to change its default character set. To do that,
invoke mysql with an option such as
--default-character-set=utf8.</p>

<p>For more information about batch mode, see Section 3.5,
Using mysql in Batch Mode.</p>

<p>MYSQL TIPS This section describes some techniques that
can help you use mysql more effectively.</p>

<p>Displaying Query Results Vertically Some query results
are much more readable when displayed vertically, instead of
in the usual horizontal table format. Queries can be
displayed vertically by terminating the query with G instead
of a semicolon. For example, longer text values that include
newlines often are much easier to read with vertical
output:</p>

<p>mysql&gt; SELECT * FROM mails WHERE LENGTH(txt) &lt; 300
LIMIT 300,G *************************** 1. row
*************************** msg_nro: 3068 date: 2000-03-01

I think this is a good idea. Is anyone familiar Thimble&gt;
with UTF-8 or Unicode? Otherwise, I&acute;ll put this on my
Thimble&gt; TODO list and see what happens. Yes, please do
that. Regards, Monty file: inbox-jani-1 hash: 190402944 1

<p>Using the --safe-updates Option For beginners, a useful
startup option is --safe-updates (or --i-am-a-dummy, which
has the same effect). It is helpful for cases when you might
have issued a DELETE FROM tbl_name statement but forgotten
the WHERE clause. Normally, such a statement deletes all
rows from the table. With --safe-updates, you can delete
rows only by specifying the key values that identify them.
This helps prevent accidents.</p>

<p>When you use the --safe-updates option, mysql issues the
following statement when it connects to the MySQL
server:</p>

<p>SET sql_safe_updates=1, sql_select_limit=1000,
sql_max_join_size=1000000;</p>

<p>See Section 5.1.4, Server System Variables.</p>

<p>The SET statement has the following effects:</p>

<p>&middot; You are not allowed to execute an UPDATE or
DELETE statement unless you specify a key constraint in the
WHERE clause or provide a LIMIT clause (or both). For
example:</p>

<p>UPDATE tbl_name SET not_key_column=val WHERE
key_column=val; UPDATE tbl_name SET not_key_column=val LIMIT
1;</p>

<p>&middot; The server limits all large SELECT results to
1,000 rows unless the statement includes a LIMIT clause.</p>

<p>&middot; The server aborts multiple-table SELECT
statements that probably need to examine more than 1,000,000
row combinations.</p>

<p>To specify limits different from 1,000 and 1,000,000,
you can override the defaults by using the --select_limit
and --max_join_size options:</p>

<p>shell&gt; mysql --safe-updates --select_limit=500
--max_join_size=10000</p>

<p>Disabling mysql Auto-Reconnect If the mysql client loses
its connection to the server while sending a statement, it
immediately and automatically tries to reconnect once to the
server and send the statement again. However, even if mysql
succeeds in reconnecting, your first connection has ended
and all your previous session objects and settings are lost:
temporary tables, the autocommit mode, and user-defined and
session variables. Also, any current transaction rolls back.
This behavior may be dangerous for you, as in the following
example where the server was shut down and restarted between
the first and second statements without you knowing it:</p>

<p>mysql&gt; SET @a=1; Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.05 sec)
mysql&gt; INSERT INTO t VALUES(@a); ERROR 2006: MySQL server
has gone away No connection. Trying to reconnect...
Connection id: 1 Current database: test Query OK, 1 row
affected (1.30 sec) mysql&gt; SELECT * FROM t; +------+ | a
| +------+ | NULL | +------+ 1 row in set (0.05 sec)</p>

<p>The @a user variable has been lost with the connection,
and after the reconnection it is undefined. If it is
important to have mysql terminate with an error if the
connection has been lost, you can start the mysql client
with the --skip-reconnect option.</p>

<p>For more information about auto-reconnect and its effect
on state information when a reconnection occurs, see Section
21.9.11, Controlling Automatic Reconnection Behavior.</p>
