<p>SUDOERS(5) MAINTENANCE COMMANDS SUDOERS(5)</p>

<p>NAME sudoers - list of which users may execute what</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sudoers file is composed of two types of
entries: aliases (basically variables) and user
specifications (which specify who may run what).</p>

<p>When multiple entries match for a user, they are applied
in order. Where there are multiple matches, the last match
is used (which is not necessarily the most specific
match).</p>

<p>The sudoers grammar will be described below in Extended
Backus-Naur Form (EBNF). Dont despair if you dont know what
EBNF is; it is fairly simple, and the definitions below are
annotated.</p>

<p>Quick guide to EBNF EBNF is a concise and exact way of
describing the grammar of a language. Each EBNF definition
is made up of production rules. E.g.,</p>

<p>symbol ::= definition | alternate1 | alternate2 ...</p>

<p>Each production rule references others and thus makes up
a grammar for the language. EBNF also contains the following
operators, which many readers will recognize from regular
expressions. Do not, however, confuse them with
&quot;wildcard&quot; characters, which have different
meanings.</p>

<p>? Means that the preceding symbol (or group of symbols)
is optional. That is, it may appear once or not at all.</p>

<p>* Means that the preceding symbol (or group of symbols)
may appear zero or more times.</p>

<p>+ Means that the preceding symbol (or group of symbols)
may appear one or more times.</p>

<p>Parentheses may be used to group symbols together. For
clarity, we will use single quotes () to designate what is a
verbatim character string (as opposed to a symbol name).</p>

<p>Aliases There are four kinds of aliases: User_Alias,
Runas_Alias, Host_Alias and Cmnd_Alias.</p>

<p>Alias ::= &rsquo;User_Alias&rsquo; User_Alias
(&rsquo;:&rsquo; User_Alias)* | &rsquo;Runas_Alias&rsquo;
Runas_Alias (&rsquo;:&rsquo; Runas_Alias)* |
&rsquo;Host_Alias&rsquo; Host_Alias (&rsquo;:&rsquo;
Host_Alias)* | &rsquo;Cmnd_Alias&rsquo; Cmnd_Alias
(&rsquo;:&rsquo; Cmnd_Alias)*</p>

<p>User_Alias ::= NAME &rsquo;=&rsquo; User_List</p>

<p>Runas_Alias ::= NAME &rsquo;=&rsquo; Runas_List</p>

<p>Host_Alias ::= NAME &rsquo;=&rsquo; Host_List</p>

<p>Cmnd_Alias ::= NAME &rsquo;=&rsquo; Cmnd_List</p>

<p>NAME ::= [A-Z]([A-Z][0-9]_)*</p>

<p>Each alias definition is of the form</p>

<p>Alias_Type NAME = item1, item2, ...</p>

<p>where Alias_Type is one of User_Alias, Runas_Alias,
Host_Alias, or Cmnd_Alias. A NAME is a string of uppercase
letters, numbers, and underscore characters (_). A NAME must
start with an uppercase letter. It is possible to put
several alias definitions of the same type on a single line,
joined by a colon (:). E.g.,</p>

<p>Alias_Type NAME = item1, item2, item3 : NAME = item4,
item5</p>

<p>The definitions of what constitutes a valid alias member
follow.</p>

<p>User_List ::= User | User &rsquo;,&rsquo; User_List</p>

<p>User ::= &rsquo;!&rsquo;* username | &rsquo;!&rsquo;*
&rsquo;#&rsquo;uid | &rsquo;!&rsquo;* &rsquo;%&rsquo;group |
&rsquo;!&rsquo;* &rsquo;+&rsquo;netgroup | &rsquo;!&rsquo;*
&rsquo;%:&rsquo;nonunix_group | &rsquo;!&rsquo;*
User_Alias</p>

<p>A User_List is made up of one or more usernames, uids
(prefixed with # ), system groups (prefixed with %),
netgroups (prefixed with +) and User_Aliases. Each list item
may be prefixed with zero or more ! operators. An odd number
of ! operators negate the value of the item; an even number
just cancel each other out.</p>

<p>A username, group, netgroup and nonunix_groups may be
enclosed in double quotes to avoid the need for escaping
special characters. Alternately, special characters may be
specified in escaped hex mode, e.g. 0 for space.</p>

<p>The nonunix_group syntax depends on the underlying
implementation. For instance, the QAS AD backend supports
the following formats:</p>

<p>&middot; Group in the same domain: &quot;Group
Name&quot;</p>

<p>&middot; Group in any domain: &quot;Group
Name@FULLY.QUALIFIED.DOMAIN&quot;</p>

<p>&middot; Group SID:
&quot;S-1-2-34-5678901234-5678901234-5678901234-567&quot;</p>

<p>Note that quotes around group names are optional.
Unquoted strings must use a backslash ( to escape spaces and
the @ symbol.</p>

<p>Runas_List ::= Runas_Member | Runas_Member
&rsquo;,&rsquo; Runas_List</p>

<p>Runas_Member ::= &rsquo;!&rsquo;* username |
&rsquo;!&rsquo;* &rsquo;#&rsquo;uid | &rsquo;!&rsquo;*
&rsquo;%&rsquo;group | &rsquo;!&rsquo;* +netgroup |
&rsquo;!&rsquo;* Runas_Alias</p>

<p>A Runas_List is similar to a User_List except that
instead of User_Aliases it can contain Runas_Aliases. Note
that usernames and groups are matched as strings. In other
words, two users (groups) with the same uid (gid) are
considered to be distinct. If you wish to match all
usernames with the same uid (e.g. root and toor), you can
use a uid instead (#0 in the example given).</p>

<p>Host_List ::= Host | Host &rsquo;,&rsquo; Host_List</p>

<p>Host ::= &rsquo;!&rsquo;* hostname | &rsquo;!&rsquo;*
ip_addr | &rsquo;!&rsquo;* network(/netmask)? |
&rsquo;!&rsquo;* &rsquo;+&rsquo;netgroup | &rsquo;!&rsquo;*
Host_Alias</p>

<p>A Host_List is made up of one or more hostnames, IP
addresses, network numbers, netgroups (prefixed with +) and
other aliases. Again, the value of an item may be negated
with the ! operator. If you do not specify a netmask along
with the network number, sudo will query each of the local
hosts network interfaces and, if the network number
corresponds to one of the hostss network interfaces, the
corresponding netmask will be used. The netmask may be
specified either in standard IP address notation (e.g.
255.255.255.0 or ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff::), or CIDR notation
(number of bits, e.g. 24 or 64). A hostname may include
shell-style wildcards (see the Wildcards section below), but
unless the hostname command on your machine returns the
fully qualified hostname, you ll need to use the fqdn option
for wildcards to be useful.</p>

<p>Cmnd_List ::= Cmnd | Cmnd &rsquo;,&rsquo; Cmnd_List</p>

<p>commandname ::= filename | filename args | filename
&rsquo;&quot;&quot;&rsquo;</p>

<p>Cmnd ::= &rsquo;!&rsquo;* commandname | &rsquo;!&rsquo;*
directory | &rsquo;!&rsquo;* &quot;sudoedit&quot; |
&rsquo;!&rsquo;* Cmnd_Alias</p>

<p>A Cmnd_List is a list of one or more commandnames,
directories, and other aliases. A commandname is a fully
qualified filename which may include shell-style wildcards
(see the Wildcards section below). A simple filename allows
the user to run the command with any arguments he/she
wishes. However, you may also specify command line arguments
(including wildcards). Alternately, you can specify
&quot;&quot; to indicate that the command may only be run
without command line arguments. A directory is a fully
qualified pathname ending in a /. When you specify a
directory in a Cmnd_List, the user will be able to run any
file within that directory (but not in any subdirectories
therein).</p>

<p>If a Cmnd has associated command line arguments, then
the arguments in the Cmnd must match exactly those given by
the user on the command line (or match the wildcards if
there are any). Note that the following characters must be
escaped with a if they are used in command arguments: ,, :,
=, . The special command &quot;sudoedit&quot; is used to
permit a user to run sudo with the -e option (or as
sudoedit). It may take command line arguments just as a
normal command does.</p>

<p>Defaults Certain configuration options may be changed
from their default values at runtime via one or more
Default_Entry lines. These may affect all users on any host,
all users on a specific host, a specific user, a specific
command, or commands being run as a specific user. Note that
per-command entries may not include command line arguments.
If you need to specify arguments, define a Cmnd_Alias and
reference that instead.</p>

<p>Default_Type ::= &rsquo;Defaults&rsquo; |
&rsquo;Defaults&rsquo; &rsquo;@&rsquo; Host_List |
&rsquo;Defaults&rsquo; &rsquo;:&rsquo; User_List |
&rsquo;Defaults&rsquo; &rsquo;!&rsquo; Cmnd_List |
&rsquo;Defaults&rsquo; &rsquo;&gt;&rsquo; Runas_List</p>

<p>Default_Entry ::= Default_Type Parameter_List</p>

<p>Parameter_List ::= Parameter | Parameter &rsquo;,&rsquo;
Parameter_List</p>

<p>Parameter ::= Parameter &rsquo;=&rsquo; Value |
Parameter &rsquo;+=&rsquo; Value | Parameter
&rsquo;-=&rsquo; Value | &rsquo;!&rsquo;* Parameter</p>

<p>Parameters may be flags, integer values, strings, or
lists. Flags are implicitly boolean and can be turned off
via the ! operator. Some integer, string and list parameters
may also be used in a boolean context to disable them.
Values may be enclosed in double quotes (&quot;) when they
contain multiple words. Special characters may be escaped
with a backslash (.</p>

<p>Lists have two additional assignment operators, += and
-=. These operators are used to add to and delete from a
list respectively. It is not an error to use the -= operator
to remove an element that does not exist in a list.</p>

<p>Defaults entries are parsed in the following order:
generic, host and user Defaults first, then runas Defaults
and finally command defaults.</p>

<p>See &quot;SUDOERS OPTIONS&quot; for a list of supported
Defaults parameters.</p>

<p>User Specification User_Spec ::= User_List Host_List
&rsquo;=&rsquo; Cmnd_Spec_List (&rsquo;:&rsquo; Host_List
&rsquo;=&rsquo; Cmnd_Spec_List)*</p>

<p>Cmnd_Spec_List ::= Cmnd_Spec | Cmnd_Spec &rsquo;,&rsquo;
Cmnd_Spec_List</p>

<p>Cmnd_Spec ::= Runas_Spec? Tag_Spec* Cmnd</p>

<p>Runas_Spec ::= &rsquo;(&rsquo; Runas_List?
(&rsquo;:&rsquo; Runas_List)? &rsquo;)&rsquo;</p>

<p>Tag_Spec ::= (&rsquo;NOPASSWD:&rsquo; |
&rsquo;PASSWD:&rsquo; | &rsquo;NOEXEC:&rsquo; |
&rsquo;EXEC:&rsquo; | &rsquo;SETENV:&rsquo; |
&rsquo;NOSETENV:&rsquo; )</p>

<p>A user specification determines which commands a user
may run (and as what user) on specified hosts. By default,
commands are run as root, but this can be changed on a
per-command basis.</p>

<p>The basic structure of a user specification is who =
where (as_whom) what. Lets break that down into its
constituent parts:</p>

<p>Runas_Spec A Runas_Spec determines the user and/or the
group that a command may be run as. A fully-specified
Runas_Spec consists of two Runas_Lists (as defined above)
separated by a colon (:) and enclosed in a set of
parentheses. The first Runas_List indicates which users the
command may be run as via sudos -u option. The second
defines a list of groups that can be specified via sudos -g
option. If both Runas_Lists are specified, the command may
be run with any combination of users and groups listed in
their respective Runas_Lists. If only the first is
specified, the command may be run as any user in the list
but no -g option may be specified. If the first Runas_List
is empty but the second is specified, the command may be run
as the invoking user with the group set to any listed in the
Runas_List. If no Runas_Spec is specified the command may be
run as root and no group may be specified.</p>

<p>A Runas_Spec sets the default for the commands that
follow it. What this means is that for the entry:</p>

<p>dgb boulder = (operator) /bin/ls, /bin/kill,
/usr/bin/lprm</p>

<p>The user dgb may run /bin/ls, /bin/kill, and
/usr/bin/lprm -- but only as operator. E.g.,</p>

<p>$ sudo -u operator /bin/ls.</p>

<p>It is also possible to override a Runas_Spec later on in
an entry. If we modify the entry like so:</p>

<p>dgb boulder = (operator) /bin/ls, (root) /bin/kill,
/usr/bin/lprm</p>

<p>Then user dgb is now allowed to run /bin/ls as operator,
but /bin/kill and /usr/bin/lprm as root.</p>

<p>We can extend this to allow dgb to run /bin/ls with
either the user or group set to operator:</p>

<p>dgb boulder = (operator : operator) /bin/ls, (root)
/bin/kill, /usr/bin/lprm</p>

<p>In the following example, user tcm may run commands that
access a modem device file with the dialer group. Note that
in this example only the group will be set, the command
still runs as user tcm.</p>

<p>tcm boulder = (:dialer) /usr/bin/tip, /usr/bin/cu,
/usr/local/bin/minicom</p>

<p>Tag_Spec A command may have zero or more tags associated
with it. There are eight possible tag values, NOPASSWD,
PASSWD, NOEXEC, EXEC, SETENV and NOSETENV. Once a tag is set
on a Cmnd, subsequent Cmnds in the Cmnd_Spec_List, inherit
the tag unless it is overridden by the opposite tag (i.e.:
PASSWD overrides NOPASSWD and NOEXEC overrides EXEC).</p>

<p>NOPASSWD and PASSWD</p>

<p>By default, sudo requires that a user authenticate him
or herself before running a command. This behavior can be
modified via the NOPASSWD tag. Like a Runas_Spec, the
NOPASSWD tag sets a default for the commands that follow it
in the Cmnd_Spec_List. Conversely, the PASSWD tag can be
used to reverse things. For example:</p>

<p>ray rushmore = NOPASSWD: /bin/kill, /bin/ls,
/usr/bin/lprm</p>

<p>would allow the user ray to run /bin/kill, /bin/ls, and
/usr/bin/lprm as root on the machine rushmore without
authenticating himself. If we only want ray to be able to
run /bin/kill without a password the entry would be:</p>

<p>ray rushmore = NOPASSWD: /bin/kill, PASSWD: /bin/ls,
/usr/bin/lprm</p>

<p>Note, however, that the PASSWD tag has no effect on
users who are in the group specified by the exempt_group
option.</p>

<p>By default, if the NOPASSWD tag is applied to any of the
entries for a user on the current host, he or she will be
able to run sudo -l without a password. Additionally, a user
may only run sudo -v without a password if the NOPASSWD tag
is present for all a users entries that pertain to the
current host. This behavior may be overridden via the
verifypw and listpw options.</p>

<p>NOEXEC and EXEC</p>

<p>If sudo has been compiled with noexec support and the
underlying operating system supports it, the NOEXEC tag can
be used to prevent a dynamically-linked executable from
running further commands itself.</p>

<p>In the following example, user aaron may run
/usr/bin/more and /usr/bin/vi but shell escapes will be
disabled.</p>

<p>aaron shanty = NOEXEC: /usr/bin/more, /usr/bin/vi</p>

<p>See the &quot;PREVENTING SHELL ESCAPES&quot; section
below for more details on how NOEXEC works and whether or
not it will work on your system.</p>

<p>SETENV and NOSETENV</p>

<p>These tags override the value of the setenv option on a
per-command basis. Note that if SETENV has been set for a
command, any environment variables set on the command line
way are not subject to the restrictions imposed by
env_check, env_delete, or env_keep. As such, only trusted
users should be allowed to set variables in this manner. If
the command matched is ALL, the SETENV tag is implied for
that command; this default may be overridden by use of the
UNSETENV tag.</p>

<p>Wildcards sudo allows shell-style wildcards (aka meta or
glob characters) to be used in hostnames, pathnames and
command line arguments in the sudoers file. Wildcard
matching is done via the POSIX glob(3) and fnmatch(3)
routines. Note that these are not regular expressions.</p>

<p>* Matches any set of zero or more characters.</p>

<p>? Matches any single character.</p>

<p>[...] Matches any character in the specified range.</p>

<p>[!...] Matches any character not in the specified
range.</p>

<p>For any character &quot;x&quot;, evaluates to
&quot;x&quot;. This is used to escape special characters
such as: &quot;*&quot;, &quot;?&quot;, &quot;[&quot;, and
&quot;}&quot;.</p>

<p>POSIX character classes may also be used if your system
s glob(3) and fnmatch(3) functions support them. However,
because the &rsquo;:&rsquo; character has special meaning in
sudoers, it must be escaped. For example:</p>

<p>/bin/ls [[alpha]]*</p>

<p>Would match any filename beginning with a letter.</p>

<p>Note that a forward slash ( /) will not be matched by
wildcards used in the pathname. When matching the command
line arguments, however, a slash does get matched by
wildcards. This is to make a path like:</p>

<p>/usr/bin/*</p>

<p>match /usr/bin/who but not /usr/bin/X11/xterm.</p>

<p>Exceptions to wildcard rules The following exceptions
apply to the above rules:</p>

<p>&quot;&quot; If the empty string &quot;&quot; is the
only command line argument in the sudoers entry it means
that command is not allowed to be run with any
arguments.</p>

<p>Including other files from within sudoers It is possible
to include other sudoers files from within the sudoers file
currently being parsed using the #include and #includedir
directives.</p>

<p>This can be used, for example, to keep a site-wide
sudoers file in addition to a local, per-machine file. For
the sake of this example the site-wide sudoers will be
/etc/sudoers and the per-machine one will be
/etc/sudoers.local. To include /etc/sudoers.local from
within /etc/sudoers we would use the following line in
/etc/sudoers:</p>

<p>#include /etc/sudoers.local</p>

<p>When sudo reaches this line it will suspend processing
of the current file (/etc/sudoers) and switch to
/etc/sudoers.local. Upon reaching the end of
/etc/sudoers.local, the rest of /etc/sudoers will be
processed. Files that are included may themselves include
other files. A hard limit of 128 nested include files is
enforced to prevent include file loops.</p>

<p>The filename may include the %h escape, signifying the
short form of the hostname. I.e., if the machines hostname
is &quot;xerxes&quot;, then</p>

<p>#include /etc/sudoers.%h</p>

<p>will cause sudo to include the file
/etc/sudoers.xerxes.</p>

<p>The #includedir directive can be used to create a sudo.d
directory that the system package manager can drop sudoers
rules into as part of package installation. For example,
given:</p>

<p>#includedir /etc/sudoers.d</p>

<p>sudo will read each file in /etc/sudoers.d, skipping
file names that end in ~ or contain a . character to avoid
causing problems with package manager or editor
temporary/backup files. Files are parsed in sorted lexical
order. That is, /etc/sudoers.d/01_first will be parsed
before /etc/sudoers.d/10_second. Be aware that because the
sorting is lexical, not numeric, /etc/sudoers.d/1_whoops
would be loaded after /etc/sudoers.d/10_second. Using a
consistent number of leading zeroes in the file names can be
used to avoid such problems.</p>

<p>Note that unlike files included via #include, visudo
will not edit the files in a #includedir directory unless
one of them contains a syntax error. It is still possible to
run visudo with the -f flag to edit the files directly.</p>

<p>Other special characters and reserved words The pound
sign (#) is used to indicate a comment (unless it is part of
a #include directive or unless it occurs in the context of a
user name and is followed by one or more digits, in which
case it is treated as a uid). Both the comment character and
any text after it, up to the end of the line, are
ignored.</p>

<p>The reserved word ALL is a built-in alias that always
causes a match to succeed. It can be used wherever one might
otherwise use a Cmnd_Alias, User_Alias, Runas_Alias, or
Host_Alias. You should not try to define your own alias
called ALL as the built-in alias will be used in preference
to your own. Please note that using ALL can be dangerous
since in a command context, it allows the user to run any
command on the system.</p>

<p>An exclamation point (!) can be used as a logical not
operator both in an alias and in front of a Cmnd. This
allows one to exclude certain values. Note, however, that
using a ! in conjunction with the built-in ALL alias to
allow a user to run &quot;all but a few&quot; commands
rarely works as intended (see SECURITY NOTES below).</p>

<p>Long lines can be continued with a backslash ( ) as the
last character on the line.</p>

<p>Whitespace between elements in a list as well as special
syntactic characters in a User Specification (=, : , ( , ) )
is optional.</p>

<p>The following characters must be escaped with a
backslash () when used as part of a word (e.g. a username or
hostname): @, ! , =, :, ,, (, ), .</p>

<p>SUDOERS OPTIONS sudo s behavior can be modified by
Default_Entry lines, as explained earlier. A list of all
supported Defaults parameters, grouped by type, are listed
below.</p>

<p>Flags:</p>

<p>always_set_home If set, sudo will set the HOME
environment variable to the home directory of the target
user (which is root unless the -u option is used). This
effectively means that the -H option is always implied. This
flag is off by default.</p>

<p>authenticate If set, users must authenticate themselves
via a password (or other means of authentication) before
they may run commands. This default may be overridden via
the PASSWD and NOPASSWD tags. This flag is on by
default.</p>

<p>closefrom_override If set, the user may use sudos -C
option which overrides the default starting point at which
sudo begins closing open file descriptors. This flag is off
by default.</p>

<p>env_editor If set, visudo will use the value of the
EDITOR or VISUAL environment variables before falling back
on the default editor list. Note that this may create a
security hole as it allows the user to run any arbitrary
command as root without logging. A safer alternative is to
place a colon-separated list of editors in the editor
variable. visudo will then only use the EDITOR or VISUAL if
they match a value specified in editor. This flag is on by
default.</p>

<p>env_reset If set, sudo will reset the environment to
only contain the LOGNAME, SHELL, USER, USERNAME and the
SUDO_* variables. Any variables in the callers environment
that match the env_keep and env_check lists are then added.
The default contents of the env_keep and env_check lists are
displayed when sudo is run by root with the -V option. If
the secure_path option is set, its value will be used for
the PATH environment variable. This flag is on by
default.</p>

<p>fqdn Set this flag if you want to put fully qualified
hostnames in the sudoers file. I.e., instead of myhost you
would use myhost.mydomain.edu. You may still use the short
form if you wish (and even mix the two). Beware that turning
on fqdn requires sudo to make DNS lookups which may make
sudo unusable if DNS stops working (for example if the
machine is not plugged into the network). Also note that you
must use the hosts official name as DNS knows it. That is,
you may not use a host alias (CNAME entry) due to
performance issues and the fact that there is no way to get
all aliases from DNS. If your machine s hostname (as
returned by the hostname command) is already fully qualified
you shouldnt need to set fqdn. This flag is off by
default.</p>

<p>ignore_dot If set, sudo will ignore . or (current dir)
in the PATH environment variable; the PATH itself is not
modified. This flag is on by default.</p>

<p>ignore_local_sudoers If set via LDAP, parsing of
/etc/sudoers will be skipped. This is intended for
Enterprises that wish to prevent the usage of local sudoers
files so that only LDAP is used. This thwarts the efforts of
rogue operators who would attempt to add roles to
/etc/sudoers. When this option is present, /etc/sudoers does
not even need to exist. Since this option tells sudo how to
behave when no specific LDAP entries have been matched, this
sudoOption is only meaningful for the cn=defaults section.
This flag is off by default.</p>

<p>insults If set, sudo will insult users when they enter
an incorrect password. This flag is off by default.</p>

<p>log_host If set, the hostname will be logged in the
(non-syslog) sudo log file. This flag is off by default.</p>

<p>log_year If set, the four-digit year will be logged in
the (non- syslog) sudo log file. This flag is off by
default.</p>

<p>long_otp_prompt When validating with a One Time Password
(OPT) scheme such as S/Key or OPIE, a two-line prompt is
used to make it easier to cut and paste the challenge to a
local window. Its not as pretty as the default but some
people find it more convenient. This flag is off by
default.</p>

<p>mail_always Send mail to the mailto user every time a
users runs sudo. This flag is off by default.</p>

<p>mail_badpass Send mail to the mailto user if the user
running sudo does not enter the correct password. This flag
is off by default.</p>

<p>mail_no_host If set, mail will be sent to the mailto
user if the invoking user exists in the sudoers file, but is
not allowed to run commands on the current host. This flag
is off by default.</p>

<p>mail_no_perms If set, mail will be sent to the mailto
user if the invoking user is allowed to use sudo but the
command they are trying is not listed in their sudoers file
entry or is explicitly denied. This flag is off by
default.</p>

<p>mail_no_user If set, mail will be sent to the mailto
user if the invoking user is not in the sudoers file. This
flag is on by default.</p>

<p>noexec If set, all commands run via sudo will behave as
if the NOEXEC tag has been set, unless overridden by a EXEC
tag. See the description of NOEXEC and EXEC below as well as
the &quot;PREVENTING SHELL ESCAPES&quot; section at the end
of this manual. This flag is off by default.</p>

<p>path_info Normally, sudo will tell the user when a
command could not be found in their PATH environment
variable. Some sites may wish to disable this as it could be
used to gather information on the location of executables
that the normal user does not have access to. The
disadvantage is that if the executable is simply not in the
user s PATH, sudo will tell the user that they are not
allowed to run it, which can be confusing. This flag is on
by default.</p>

<p>passprompt_override The password prompt specified by
passprompt will normally only be used if the passwod prompt
provided by systems such as PAM matches the string
&quot;Password:&quot;. If passprompt_override is set,
passprompt will always be used. This flag is off by
default.</p>

<p>preserve_groups By default, sudo will initialize the
group vector to the list of groups the target user is in.
When preserve_groups is set, the users existing group vector
is left unaltered. The real and effective group IDs,
however, are still set to match the target user. This flag
is off by default.</p>

<p>pwfeedback By default, sudo reads the password like most
other Unix programs, by turning off echo until the user hits
the return (or enter) key. Some users become confused by
this as it appears to them that sudo has hung at this point.
When pwfeedback is set, sudo will provide visual feedback
when the user presses a key. Note that this does have a
security impact as an onlooker may be able to determine the
length of the password being entered. This flag is off by
default.</p>

<p>requiretty If set, sudo will only run when the user is
logged in to a real tty. When this flag is set, sudo can
only be run from a login session and not via other means
such as cron(8) or cgi-bin scripts. This flag is off by
default.</p>

<p>root_sudo If set, root is allowed to run sudo too.
Disabling this prevents users from &quot;chaining&quot; sudo
commands to get a root shell by doing something like
&quot;sudo sudo /bin/sh&quot;. Note, however, that turning
off root_sudo will also prevent root and from running
sudoedit. Disabling root_sudo provides no real additional
security; it exists purely for historical reasons. This flag
is on by default.</p>

<p>rootpw If set, sudo will prompt for the root password
instead of the password of the invoking user. This flag is
off by default.</p>

<p>runaspw If set, sudo will prompt for the password of the
user defined by the runas_default option (defaults to root)
instead of the password of the invoking user. This flag is
off by default.</p>

<p>set_home If set and sudo is invoked with the -s option
the HOME environment variable will be set to the home
directory of the target user (which is root unless the -u
option is used). This effectively makes the -s option imply
-H. This flag is off by default.</p>

<p>set_logname Normally, sudo will set the LOGNAME, USER
and USERNAME environment variables to the name of the target
user (usually root unless the -u option is given). However,
since some programs (including the RCS revision control
system) use LOGNAME to determine the real identity of the
user, it may be desirable to change this behavior. This can
be done by negating the set_logname option. Note that if the
env_reset option has not been disabled, entries in the
env_keep list will override the value of set_logname. This
flag is off by default.</p>

<p>setenv Allow the user to disable the env_reset option
from the command line. Additionally, environment variables
set via the command line are not subject to the restrictions
imposed by env_check, env_delete, or env_keep. As such, only
trusted users should be allowed to set variables in this
manner. This flag is off by default.</p>

<p>shell_noargs If set and sudo is invoked with no
arguments it acts as if the -s option had been given. That
is, it runs a shell as root (the shell is determined by the
SHELL environment variable if it is set, falling back on the
shell listed in the invoking user s /etc/passwd entry if
not). This flag is off by default.</p>

<p>fast_glob Normally, sudo uses the glob(3) function to do
shell- style globbing when matching pathnames. However,
since it accesses the file system, glob(3) can take a long
time to complete for some patterns, especially when the
pattern references a network file system that is mounted on
demand (automounted). The fast_glob option causes sudo to
use the fnmatch(3) function, which does not access the file
system to do its matching. The disadvantage of fast_glob is
that it is unable to match relative pathnames such as ./ls
or ../bin/ls. This flag is off by default.</p>

<p>stay_setuid Normally, when sudo executes a command the
real and effective UIDs are set to the target user (root by
default). This option changes that behavior such that the
real UID is left as the invoking users UID. In other words,
this makes sudo act as a setuid wrapper. This can be useful
on systems that disable some potentially dangerous
functionality when a program is run setuid. This option is
only effective on systems with either the setreuid() or
setresuid() function. This flag is off by default.</p>

<p>targetpw If set, sudo will prompt for the password of
the user specified by the -u option (defaults to root)
instead of the password of the invoking user. Note that this
precludes the use of a uid not listed in the passwd database
as an argument to the -u option. This flag is off by
default.</p>

<p>tty_tickets If set, users must authenticate on a per-tty
basis. Normally, sudo uses a directory in the ticket dir
with the same name as the user running it. With this flag
enabled, sudo will use a file named for the tty the user is
logged in on in that directory. This flag is on by
default.</p>

<p>umask_override If set, sudo will set the umask as
specified by sudoers without modification. This makes it
possible to specify a more permissive umask in sudoers than
the user s own umask and matches historical behavior. If
umask_override is not set, sudo will set the umask to be the
union of the users umask and what is specified in sudoers.
This flag is off by default.</p>

<p>visiblepw By default, sudo will refuse to run if the
user must enter a password but it is not possible to disable
echo on the terminal. If the visiblepw flag is set, sudo
will prompt for a password even when it would be visible on
the screen. This makes it possible to run things like
&quot;rsh somehost sudo ls&quot; since rsh(1) does not
allocate a tty. This flag is off by default.</p>

<p>Integers:</p>

<p>closefrom Before it executes a command, sudo will close
all open file descriptors other than standard input,
standard output and standard error (ie: file descriptors
0-2). The closefrom option can be used to specify a
different file descriptor at which to start closing. The
default is 3.</p>

<p>passwd_tries The number of tries a user gets to enter
his/her password before sudo logs the failure and exits. The
default is 3.</p>

<p>Integers that can be used in a boolean context:</p>

<p>loglinelen Number of characters per line for the file
log. This value is used to decide when to wrap lines for
nicer log files. This has no effect on the syslog log file,
only the file log. The default is 80 (use 0 or negate the
option to disable word wrap).</p>

<p>passwd_timeout Number of minutes before the sudo
password prompt times out. The default is 5; set this to 0
for no password timeout.</p>

<p>timestamp_timeout Number of minutes that can elapse
before sudo will ask for a passwd again. The default is 5.
Set this to 0 to always prompt for a password. If set to a
value less than 0 the users timestamp will never expire.
This can be used to allow users to create or delete their
own timestamps via sudo -v and sudo -k respectively.</p>

<p>umask Umask to use when running the command. Negate this
option or set it to 0777 to preserve the users umask. The
actual umask that is used will be the union of the users
umask and 0022. This guarantees that sudo never lowers the
umask when running a command. Note on systems that use PAM,
the default PAM configuration may specify its own umask
which will override the value set in sudoers.</p>

<p>Strings:</p>

<p>badpass_message Message that is displayed if a user
enters an incorrect password. The default is Sorry, try
again. unless insults are enabled.</p>

<p>editor A colon (: ) separated list of editors allowed to
be used with visudo. visudo will choose the editor that
matches the user s EDITOR environment variable if possible,
or the first editor in the list that exists and is
executable. The default is the path to vi on your
system.</p>

<p>mailsub Subject of the mail sent to the mailto user. The
escape %h will expand to the hostname of the machine.
Default is *** SECURITY information for %h ***.</p>

<p>noexec_file Path to a shared library containing dummy
versions of the execv(), execve() and fexecve() library
functions that just return an error. This is used to
implement the noexec functionality on systems that support
LD_PRELOAD or its equivalent. Defaults to
/usr/libexec/sudo_noexec.so.</p>

<p>passprompt The default prompt to use when asking for a
password; can be overridden via the -p option or the
SUDO_PROMPT environment variable. The following percent (%)
escapes are supported:</p>

<p>%H expanded to the local hostname including the domain
name (on if the machines hostname is fully qualified or the
fqdn option is set)</p>

<p>%h expanded to the local hostname without the domain
name</p>

<p>%p expanded to the user whose password is being asked
for (respects the rootpw, targetpw and runaspw flags in
sudoers)</p>

<p>%U expanded to the login name of the user the command
will be run as (defaults to root)</p>

<p>%u expanded to the invoking users login name</p>

<p>%% two consecutive % characters are collapsed into a
single % character</p>

<p>The default value is [sudo] password for %p: .</p>

<p>role The default SELinux role to use when constructing a
new security context to run the command. The default role
may be overridden on a per-command basis in sudoers or via
command line options. This option is only available whe sudo
is built with SELinux support.</p>

<p>runas_default The default user to run commands as if the
-u option is not specified on the command line. This
defaults to root. Note that if runas_default is set it must
occur before any Runas_Alias specifications.</p>

<p>syslog_badpri Syslog priority to use when user
authenticates unsuccessfully. Defaults to alert.</p>

<p>syslog_goodpri Syslog priority to use when user
authenticates successfully. Defaults to notice.</p>

<p>sudoers_locale Locale to use when parsing the sudoers
file. Note that changing the locale may affect how sudoers
is interpreted. Defaults to &quot;C&quot;.</p>

<p>timestampdir The directory in which sudo stores its
timestamp files. The default is /var/run/sudo.</p>

<p>timestampowner The owner of the timestamp directory and
the timestamps stored therein. The default is root.</p>

<p>type The default SELinux type to use when constructing a
new security context to run the command. The default type
may be overridden on a per-command basis in sudoers or via
command line options. This option is only available whe sudo
is built with SELinux support.</p>

<p>Strings that can be used in a boolean context:</p>

<p>askpass The askpass option specifies the fully qualified
path to a helper program used to read the users password
when no terminal is available. This may be the case when
sudo is executed from a graphical (as opposed to text-based)
application. The program specified by askpass should display
the argument passed to it as the prompt and write the user s
password to the standard output. The value of askpass may be
overridden by the SUDO_ASKPASS environment variable.</p>

<p>env_file The env_file options specifies the fully
qualified path to a file containing variables to be set in
the environment of the program being run. Entries in this
file should either be of the form VARIABLE=value or export
VARIABLE=value. The value may optionally be surrounded by
single or double quotes. Variables in this file are subject
to other sudo environment settings such as env_keep and
env_check.</p>

<p>exempt_group Users in this group are exempt from
password and PATH requirements. This is not set by
default.</p>

<p>lecture This option controls when a short lecture will
be printed along with the password prompt. It has the
following possible values:</p>

<p>always Always lecture the user.</p>

<p>never Never lecture the user.</p>

<p>once Only lecture the user the first time they run
sudo.</p>

<p>If no value is specified, a value of once is implied.
Negating the option results in a value of never being used.
The default value is once.</p>

<p>lecture_file Path to a file containing an alternate sudo
lecture that will be used in place of the standard lecture
if the named file exists. By default, sudo uses a built-in
lecture.</p>

<p>listpw This option controls when a password will be
required when a user runs sudo with the -l option. It has
the following possible values:</p>

<p>all All the users sudoers entries for the current host
must have the NOPASSWD flag set to avoid entering a
password.</p>

<p>always The user must always enter a password to use the
-l option.</p>

<p>any At least one of the user s sudoers entries for the
current host must have the NOPASSWD flag set to avoid
entering a password.</p>

<p>never The user need never enter a password to use the -l
option.</p>

<p>If no value is specified, a value of any is implied.
Negating the option results in a value of never being used.
The default value is any.</p>

<p>logfile Path to the sudo log file (not the syslog log
file). Setting a path turns on logging to a file; negating
this option turns it off. By default, sudo logs via
syslog.</p>

<p>mailerflags Flags to use when invoking mailer. Defaults
to -t.</p>

<p>mailerpath Path to mail program used to send warning
mail. Defaults to the path to sendmail found at configure
time.</p>

<p>mailfrom Address to use for the &quot;from&quot; address
when sending warning and error mail. The address should be
enclosed in double quotes (&quot;) to protect against sudo
interpreting the @ sign. Defaults to the name of the user
running sudo.</p>

<p>mailto Address to send warning and error mail to. The
address should be enclosed in double quotes (&quot;) to
protect against sudo interpreting the @ sign. Defaults to
root.</p>

<p>secure_path Path used for every command run from sudo.
If you dont trust the people running sudo to have a sane
PATH environment variable you may want to use this. Another
use is if you want to have the &quot;root path&quot; be
separate from the &quot;user path.&quot; Users in the group
specified by the exempt_group option are not affected by
secure_path. This option is not set by default.</p>

<p>syslog Syslog facility if syslog is being used for
logging (negate to disable syslog logging). Defaults to
authpriv.</p>

<p>verifypw This option controls when a password will be
required when a user runs sudo with the -v option. It has
the following possible values:</p>

<p>all All the users sudoers entries for the current host
must have the NOPASSWD flag set to avoid entering a
password.</p>

<p>always The user must always enter a password to use the
-v option.</p>

<p>any At least one of the users sudoers entries for the
current host must have the NOPASSWD flag set to avoid
entering a password.</p>

<p>never The user need never enter a password to use the -v
option.</p>

<p>If no value is specified, a value of all is implied.
Negating the option results in a value of never being used.
The default value is all.</p>

<p>Lists that can be used in a boolean context:</p>

<p>env_check Environment variables to be removed from the
users environment if the variable s value contains % or /
characters. This can be used to guard against printf- style
format vulnerabilities in poorly-written programs. The
argument may be a double-quoted, space- separated list or a
single value without double-quotes. The list can be
replaced, added to, deleted from, or disabled by using the
=, +=, -=, and ! operators respectively. Regardless of
whether the env_reset option is enabled or disabled,
variables specified by env_check will be preserved in the
environment if they pass the aforementioned check. The
default list of environment variables to check is displayed
when sudo is run by root with the -V option.</p>

<p>env_delete Environment variables to be removed from the
users environment when the env_reset option is not in
effect. The argument may be a double-quoted, space-separated
list or a single value without double-quotes. The list can
be replaced, added to, deleted from, or disabled by using
the =, +=, -=, and ! operators respectively. The default
list of environment variables to remove is displayed when
sudo is run by root with the -V option. Note that many
operating systems will remove potentially dangerous
variables from the environment of any setuid process (such
as sudo).</p>

<p>env_keep Environment variables to be preserved in the
users environment when the env_reset option is in effect.
This allows fine-grained control over the environment
sudo-spawned processes will receive. The argument may be a
double-quoted, space-separated list or a single value
without double-quotes. The list can be replaced, added to,
deleted from, or disabled by using the =, +=, -=, and !
operators respectively. The default list of variables to
keep is displayed when sudo is run by root with the -V
option.</p>

<p>When logging via syslog(3), sudo accepts the following
values for the syslog facility (the value of the syslog
Parameter): authpriv (if your OS supports it), auth, daemon,
user, local0, local1, local2, local3, local4, local5,
local6, and local7. The following syslog priorities are
supported: alert, crit, debug, emerg, err, info, notice, and
warning.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/sudoers List of who can run what</p>

<p>/etc/group Local groups file</p>

<p>/etc/netgroup List of network groups</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Below are example sudoers entries. Admittedly,
some of these are a bit contrived. First, we define our
aliases:</p>

<p># User alias specification User_Alias FULLTIMERS =
millert, mikef, dowdy User_Alias PARTTIMERS = bostley,
jwfox, crawl User_Alias WEBMASTERS = will, wendy, wim</p>

<p># Runas alias specification Runas_Alias OP = root,
operator Runas_Alias DB = oracle, sybase Runas_Alias
ADMINGRP = adm, oper</p>

<p># Host alias specification Host_Alias SPARC = bigtime,
eclipse, moet, anchor : SGI = grolsch, dandelion, black :
ALPHA = widget, thalamus, foobar : HPPA = boa, nag, python
Host_Alias CUNETS = 128.138.0.0/255.255.0.0 Host_Alias
CSNETS = 128.138.243.0, 128.138.204.0/24, 128.138.242.0
Host_Alias SERVERS = master, mail, www, ns Host_Alias CDROM
= orion, perseus, hercules</p>

<p># Cmnd alias specification Cmnd_Alias DUMPS =
/usr/bin/mt, /usr/sbin/dump, /usr/sbin/rdump,
/usr/sbin/restore, /usr/sbin/rrestore Cmnd_Alias KILL =
/usr/bin/kill Cmnd_Alias PRINTING = /usr/sbin/lpc,
/usr/bin/lprm Cmnd_Alias SHUTDOWN = /usr/sbin/shutdown
Cmnd_Alias HALT = /usr/sbin/halt Cmnd_Alias REBOOT =
/usr/sbin/reboot Cmnd_Alias SHELLS = /usr/bin/sh,
/usr/bin/csh, /usr/bin/ksh, /usr/local/bin/tcsh,
/usr/bin/rsh, /usr/local/bin/zsh Cmnd_Alias SU = /usr/bin/su
Cmnd_Alias PAGERS = /usr/bin/more, /usr/bin/pg,
/usr/bin/less</p>

<p>Here we override some of the compiled in default values.
We want sudo to log via syslog(3) using the auth facility in
all cases. We dont want to subject the full time staff to
the sudo lecture, user millert need not give a password, and
we dont want to reset the LOGNAME, USER or USERNAME
environment variables when running commands as root.
Additionally, on the machines in the SERVERS Host_Alias, we
keep an additional local log file and make sure we log the
year in each log line since the log entries will be kept
around for several years. Lastly, we disable shell escapes
for the commands in the PAGERS Cmnd_Alias (/usr/bin/more,
/usr/bin/pg and /usr/bin/less).</p>

<p># Override built-in defaults Defaults syslog=auth
Defaults&gt;root !set_logname Defaults:FULLTIMERS !lecture
Defaults:millert !authenticate Defaults@SERVERS log_year,
logfile=/var/log/sudo.log Defaults!PAGERS noexec</p>

<p>The User specification is the part that actually
determines who may run what.</p>

<p>root ALL = (ALL) ALL %wheel ALL = (ALL) ALL</p>

<p>We let root and any user in group wheel run any command
on any host as any user.</p>

<p>FULLTIMERS ALL = NOPASSWD: ALL</p>

<p>Full time sysadmins (millert, mikef, and dowdy) may run
any command on any host without authenticating
themselves.</p>

<p>PARTTIMERS ALL = ALL</p>

<p>Part time sysadmins (bostley, jwfox, and crawl) may run
any command on any host but they must authenticate
themselves first (since the entry lacks the NOPASSWD
tag).</p>

<p>jack CSNETS = ALL</p>

<p>The user jack may run any command on the machines in the
CSNETS alias (the networks 128.138.243.0, 128.138.204.0, and
128.138.242.0). Of those networks, only 128.138.204.0 has an
explicit netmask (in CIDR notation) indicating it is a class
C network. For the other networks in CSNETS, the local
machines netmask will be used during matching.</p>

<p>lisa CUNETS = ALL</p>

<p>The user lisa may run any command on any host in the
CUNETS alias (the class B network 128.138.0.0).</p>

<p>operator ALL = DUMPS, KILL, SHUTDOWN, HALT, REBOOT,
PRINTING, sudoedit /etc/printcap, /usr/oper/bin/</p>

<p>The operator user may run commands limited to simple
maintenance. Here, those are commands related to backups,
killing processes, the printing system, shutting down the
system, and any commands in the directory
/usr/oper/bin/.</p>

<p>joe ALL = /usr/bin/su operator</p>

<p>The user joe may only su(1) to operator.</p>

<p>pete HPPA = /usr/bin/passwd [A-Za-z]*, !/usr/bin/passwd
root</p>

<p>%opers ALL = (: ADMINGRP) /usr/sbin/</p>

<p>Users in the opers group may run commands in /usr/sbin/
as themselves with any group in the ADMINGRP Runas_Alias
(the adm and oper groups).</p>

<p>The user pete is allowed to change anyones password
except for root on the HPPA machines. Note that this assumes
passwd(1) does not take multiple usernames on the command
line.</p>

<p>bob SPARC = (OP) ALL : SGI = (OP) ALL</p>

<p>The user bob may run anything on the SPARC and SGI
machines as any user listed in the OP Runas_Alias (root and
operator).</p>

<p>jim +biglab = ALL</p>

<p>The user jim may run any command on machines in the
biglab netgroup. sudo knows that &quot;biglab&quot; is a
netgroup due to the + prefix.</p>

<p>+secretaries ALL = PRINTING, /usr/bin/adduser,
/usr/bin/rmuser</p>

<p>Users in the secretaries netgroup need to help manage
the printers as well as add and remove users, so they are
allowed to run those commands on all machines.</p>

<p>fred ALL = (DB) NOPASSWD: ALL</p>

<p>The user fred can run commands as any user in the DB
Runas_Alias (oracle or sybase) without giving a
password.</p>

<p>john ALPHA = /usr/bin/su [!-]*, !/usr/bin/su *root*</p>

<p>On the ALPHA machines, user john may su to anyone except
root but he is not allowed to specify any options to the
su(1) command.</p>

<p>jen ALL, !SERVERS = ALL</p>

<p>The user jen may run any command on any machine except
for those in the SERVERS Host_Alias (master, mail, www and
ns).</p>

<p>jill SERVERS = /usr/bin/, !SU, !SHELLS</p>

<p>For any machine in the SERVERS Host_Alias, jill may run
any commands in the directory /usr/bin/ except for those
commands belonging to the SU and SHELLS Cmnd_Aliases.</p>

<p>steve CSNETS = (operator) /usr/local/op_commands/</p>

<p>The user steve may run any command in the directory
/usr/local/op_commands/ but only as user operator.</p>

<p>matt valkyrie = KILL</p>

<p>On his personal workstation, valkyrie, matt needs to be
able to kill hung processes.</p>

<p>WEBMASTERS www = (www) ALL, (root) /usr/bin/su www</p>

<p>On the host www, any user in the WEBMASTERS User_Alias
(will, wendy, and wim), may run any command as user www
(which owns the web pages) or simply su(1) to www.</p>

<p>ALL CDROM = NOPASSWD: /sbin/umount /CDROM, /sbin/mount
-o nosuidnodev /dev/cd0a /CDROM</p>

<p>Any user may mount or unmount a CD-ROM on the machines
in the CDROM Host_Alias (orion, perseus, hercules) without
entering a password. This is a bit tedious for users to
type, so it is a prime candidate for encapsulating in a
shell script.</p>

<p>SECURITY NOTES It is generally not effective to
&quot;subtract&quot; commands from ALL using the ! operator.
A user can trivially circumvent this by copying the desired
command to a different name and then executing that. For
example:</p>

<p>bill ALL = ALL, !SU, !SHELLS</p>

<p>Doesn t really prevent bill from running the commands
listed in SU or SHELLS since he can simply copy those
commands to a different name, or use a shell escape from an
editor or other program. Therefore, these kind of
restrictions should be considered advisory at best (and
reinforced by policy).</p>

<p>PREVENTING SHELL ESCAPES Once sudo executes a program,
that program is free to do whatever it pleases, including
run other programs. This can be a security issue since it is
not uncommon for a program to allow shell escapes, which
lets a user bypass sudo s access control and logging. Common
programs that permit shell escapes include shells
(obviously), editors, paginators, mail and terminal
programs.</p>

<p>There are two basic approaches to this problem:</p>

<p>restrict Avoid giving users access to commands that
allow the user to run arbitrary commands. Many editors have
a restricted mode where shell escapes are disabled, though
sudoedit is a better solution to running editors via sudo.
Due to the large number of programs that offer shell
escapes, restricting users to the set of programs that do
not if often unworkable.</p>

<p>noexec Many systems that support shared libraries have
the ability to override default library functions by
pointing an environment variable (usually LD_PRELOAD) to an
alternate shared library. On such systems, sudos noexec
functionality can be used to prevent a program run by sudo
from executing any other programs. Note, however, that this
applies only to native dynamically-linked executables.
Statically-linked executables and foreign executables
running under binary emulation are not affected.</p>

<p>To tell whether or not sudo supports noexec, you can run
the following as root:</p>

<p>sudo -V | grep &quot;dummy exec&quot;</p>

<p>If the resulting output contains a line that begins
with:</p>

<p>File containing dummy exec functions:</p>

<p>then sudo may be able to replace the exec family of
functions in the standard library with its own that simply
return an error. Unfortunately, there is no foolproof way to
know whether or not noexec will work at compile-time. noexec
should work on SunOS, Solaris, *BSD, Linux, IRIX, Tru64
UNIX, MacOS X, and HP-UX 11.x. It is known not to work on
AIX and UnixWare. noexec is expected to work on most
operating systems that support the LD_PRELOAD environment
variable. Check your operating systems manual pages for the
dynamic linker (usually ld.so, ld.so.1, dyld, dld.sl, rld,
or loader) to see if LD_PRELOAD is supported.</p>

<p>To enable noexec for a command, use the NOEXEC tag as
documented in the User Specification section above. Here is
that example again:</p>

<p>aaron shanty = NOEXEC: /usr/bin/more, /usr/bin/vi</p>

<p>This allows user aaron to run /usr/bin/more and
/usr/bin/vi with noexec enabled. This will prevent those two
commands from executing other commands (such as a shell). If
you are unsure whether or not your system is capable of
supporting noexec you can always just try it out and see if
it works.</p>

<p>Note that restricting shell escapes is not a panacea.
Programs running as root are still capable of many
potentially hazardous operations (such as changing or
overwriting files) that could lead to unintended privilege
escalation. In the specific case of an editor, a safer
approach is to give the user permission to run sudoedit.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO rsh(1), su(1), fnmatch(3), glob(3), sudo(8),
visudo(8)</p>

<p>CAVEATS The sudoers file should always be edited by the
visudo command which locks the file and does grammatical
checking. It is imperative that sudoers be free of syntax
errors since sudo will not run with a syntactically
incorrect sudoers file.</p>

<p>When using netgroups of machines (as opposed to users),
if you store fully qualified hostnames in the netgroup (as
is usually the case), you either need to have the machine s
hostname be fully qualified as returned by the hostname
command or use the fqdn option in sudoers.</p>
