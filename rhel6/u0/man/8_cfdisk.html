<p>CFDISK(8) Linux Programmer s Manual CFDISK(8)</p>

<p>NAME cfdisk - Curses based disk partition table
manipulator for Linux</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS cfdisk [-agvz] [-c cylinders] [-h heads] [-s
sectors-per-track] [-P opt] [device]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION cfdisk is a curses based program for
partitioning any hard disk drive. Typical values of the
device argument are:</p>

<p>/dev/hda [default] /dev/hdb /dev/sda /dev/sdb /dev/sdc
/dev/sdd</p>

<p>In order to write the partition table cfdisk needs
something called the geometry of the disk: the number of
heads and the number of sec- tors per track. Linux does not
use any geometry, so if the disk will not be accessed by
other operating systems, you can safely accept the defaults
that cfdisk chooses for you. The geometry used by cfdisk is
found as follows. First the partition table is examined, to
see what geometry was used by the previous program that
changed it. If the par- tition table is empty, or contains
garbage, or does not point at a con- sistent geometry, the
kernel is asked for advice. If nothing works 255 heads and
63 sectors/track is assumed. The geometry can be overridden
on the command line or by use of the g command. When
partitioning an empty large modern disk, picking 255 heads
and 63 sectors/track is always a good idea. There is no need
to set the number of cylinders, since cfdisk knows the disk
size.</p>

<p>Next, cfdisk tries to read the current partition table
from the disk drive. If it is unable to figure out the
partition table, an error is displayed and the program will
exit. This might also be caused by incorrect geometry
information, and can be overridden on the command line.
Another way around this problem is with the -z option. This
will ignore the partition table on the disk.</p>

<p>The main display is composed of four sections, from top
to bottom: the header, the partitions, the command line and
a warning line. The header contains the program name and
version number followed by the disk drive and its geometry.
The partitions section always displays the current partition
table. The command line is the place where com- mands and
text are entered. The available commands are usually dis-
played in brackets. The warning line is usually empty except
when there is important information to be displayed. The
current partition is highlighted with reverse video (or an
arrow if the -a option is given). All partition specific
commands apply to the current parti- tion.</p>

<p>The format of the partition table in the partitions
section is, from left to right: Name, Flags, Partition Type,
Filesystem Type and Size. The name is the partition device
name. The flags can be Boot, which designates a bootable
partition or NC, which stands for &quot;Not Compatible with
DOS or OS/2&quot;. DOS, OS/2 and possibly other operating
systems require the first sector of the first partition on
the disk and all logical partitions to begin on the second
head. This wastes the second through the last sector of the
first track of the first head (the first sector is taken by
the partition table itself). cfdisk allows you to recover
these &quot;lost&quot; sectors with the maximize command
(m). Note: fdisk(8) and some early versions of DOS create
all partitions with the number of sectors already maximized.
For more information, see the maximize command below. The
partition type can be one of Primary or Logical. For
unallocated space on the drive, the partition type can also
be Pri/Log, or empty (if the space is unusable). The
filesystem type section displays the name of the filesystem
used on the partition, if known. If it is unknown, then
Unknown and the hex value of the filesystem type are
displayed. A special case occurs when there are sections of
the disk drive that cannot be used (because all of the pri-
mary partitions are used). When this is detected, the
filesystem type is displayed as Unusable. The size field
displays the size of the par- tition in megabytes (by
default). It can also display the size in sec- tors and
cylinders (see the change units command below). If an aster-
isk (*) appears after the size, this means that the
partition is not aligned on cylinder boundaries.</p>

<p>DOS 6.x WARNING The DOS 6.x FORMAT command looks for
some information in the first sec- tor of the data area of
the partition, and treats this information as more reliable
than the information in the partition table. DOS FORMAT
expects DOS FDISK to clear the first 512 bytes of the data
area of a partition whenever a size change occurs. DOS
FORMAT will look at this extra information even if the /U
flag is given -- we consider this a bug in DOS FORMAT and
DOS FDISK.</p>

<p>The bottom line is that if you use cfdisk or fdisk to
change the size of a DOS partition table entry, then you
must also use dd to zero the first 512 bytes of that
partition before using DOS FORMAT to format the partition.
For example, if you were using cfdisk to make a DOS parti-
tion table entry for /dev/hda1, then (after exiting fdisk or
cfdisk and rebooting Linux so that the partition table
information is valid) you would use the command &quot;dd
if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hda1 bs=512 count=1&quot; to zero the
first 512 bytes of the partition. Note:</p>

<p>BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL if you use the dd command, since a
small typo can make all of the data on your disk
useless.</p>

<p>For best results, you should always use an OS-specific
partition table program. For example, you should make DOS
partitions with the DOS FDISK program and Linux partitions
with the Linux fdisk or Linux cfdisk program.</p>

<p>COMMANDS cfdisk commands can be entered by pressing the
desired key (pressing Enter after the command is not
necessary). Here is a list of the available commands:</p>

<p>b Toggle bootable flag of the current partition. This
allows you to select which primary partition is bootable on
the drive.</p>

<p>d Delete the current partition. This will convert the
current partition into free space and merge it with any free
space imme- diately surrounding the current partition. A
partition already marked as free space or marked as unusable
cannot be deleted.</p>

<p>g Change the disk geometry (cylinders, heads, or
sectors-per- track). WARNING: This option should only be
used by people who know what they are doing. A command line
option is also avail- able to change the disk geometry.
While at the change disk geometry command line, you can
choose to change cylinders (c), heads (h), and sectors per
track (s). The default value will be printed at the prompt
which you can accept by simply pressing the Enter key, or
you can exit without changes by pressing the ESC key. If you
want to change the default value, simply enter the desired
value and press Enter. The altered disk parameter values do
not take effect until you return to the main menu (by
pressing Enter or ESC at the change disk geometry command
line). If you change the geometry such that the disk appears
larger, the extra sectors are added at the end of the disk
as free space. If the disk appears smaller, the partitions
that are beyond the new last sector are deleted and the last
partition on the drive (or the free space at the end of the
drive) is made to end at the new last sector.</p>

<p>h Print the help screen.</p>

<p>m Maximize disk usage of the current partition. This
command will recover the unused space between the partition
table and the beginning of the partition, but at the cost of
making the parti- tion incompatible with DOS, OS/2 and
possibly other operating systems. This option will toggle
between maximal disk usage and DOS, OS/2, etc. compatible
disk usage. The default when creat- ing a partition is to
create DOS, OS/2, etc. compatible parti- tions.</p>

<p>n Create new partition from free space. If the partition
type is Primary or Logical, a partition of that type will be
created, but if the partition type is Pri/Log, you will be
prompted for the type you want to create. Be aware that (1)
there are only four slots available for primary partitions
and (2) since there can be only one extended partition,
which contains all of the logical drives, all of the logical
drives must be contiguous (with no intervening primary
partition). cfdisk next prompts you for the size of the
partition you want to create. The default size, equal to the
entire free space of the current par- tition, is displayed
in megabytes. You can either press the Enter key to accept
the default size or enter a different size at the prompt.
cfdisk accepts size entries in megabytes (M) [default],
kilobytes (K), cylinders (C) and sectors (S) by entering the
number immediately followed by one of (M, K, C or S). If the
partition fills the free space available, the parti- tion is
created and you are returned to the main command line.
Otherwise, the partition can be created at the beginning or
the end of the free space, and cfdisk will ask you to choose
where to place the partition. After the partition is
created, cfdisk automatically adjusts the other partitions
partition types if all of the primary partitions are
used.</p>

<p>p Print the partition table to the screen or to a file.
There are several different formats for the partition that
you can choose from:</p>

<p>r Raw data format (exactly what would be written to
disk)</p>

<p>s Partition table in sector order format</p>

<p>t Partition table in raw format</p>

<p>The raw data format will print the sectors that would be
written to disk if a write command is selected. First, the
primary par- tition table is printed, followed by the
partition tables asso- ciated with each logical partition.
The data is printed in hex byte by byte with 16 bytes per
line.</p>

<p>The partition table in sector order format will print
the parti- tion table ordered by sector number. The fields,
from left to right, are the number of the partition, the
partition type, the first sector, the last sector, the
offset from the first sector of the partition to the start
of the data, the length of the partition, the filesystem
type (with the hex value in parenthesis), and the flags
(with the hex value in parenthesis). In addition to the
primary and logical partitions, free and unusable space is
printed and the extended partition is printed before the
first logical partition.</p>

<p>If a partition does not start or end on a cylinder
boundary or if the partition length is not divisible by the
cylinder size, an asterisk (*) is printed after the
non-aligned sector num- ber/count. This usually indicates
that a partition was created by an operating system that
either does not align partitions to cylinder boundaries or
that used different disk geometry infor- mation. If you know
the disk geometry of the other operating system, you could
enter the geometry information with the change geometry
command (g).</p>

<p>For the first partition on the disk and for all logical
parti- tions, if the offset from the beginning of the
partition is not equal to the number of sectors per track
(i.e., the data does not start on the first head), a number
sign (#) is printed after the offset. For the remaining
partitions, if the offset is not zero, a number sign will be
printed after the offset. This cor- responds to the NC flag
in the partitions section of the main display.</p>

<p>The partition table in raw format will print the
partition table ordered by partition number. It will leave
out all free and unusable space. The fields, from left to
right, are the number of the partition, the flags (in hex),
the starting head, sector and cylinder, the filesystem ID
(in hex), the ending head, sec- tor and cylinder, the
starting sector in the partition and the number of sectors
in the partition. The information in this ta- ble can be
directly translated to the raw data format.</p>

<p>The partition table entries only have 10 bits available
to rep- resent the starting and ending cylinders. Thus, when
the abso- lute starting (ending) sector number is on a
cylinder greater than 1023, the maximal values for starting
(ending) head, sector and cylinder are printed. This is the
method used by OS/2, and thus fixes the problems associated
with OS/2s fdisk rewriting the partition table when it is
not in this format. Since Linux and OS/2 use absolute sector
counts, the values in the starting and ending head, sector
and cylinder are not used.</p>

<p>q Quit program. This will exit the program without
writing any data to disk.</p>

<p>t Change the filesystem type. By default, new partitions
are cre- ated as Linux partitions, but since cfdisk can
create partitions for other operating systems, change
partition type allows you to enter the hex value of the
filesystem you desire. A list of the know filesystem types
is displayed. You can type in the filesystem type at the
prompt or accept the default filesystem type [Linux].</p>

<p>u Change units of the partition size display. It will
rotate through megabytes, sectors and cylinders.</p>

<p>W Write partition table to disk (must enter an upper
case W). Since this might destroy data on the disk, you must
either con- firm or deny the write by entering yes or no. If
you enter yes, cfdisk will write the partition table to disk
and the tell the kernel to re-read the partition table from
the disk. The re-reading of the partition table does not
work in some cases, for example for device-mapper devices.
In particular case you need to inform kernel about new
partitions by part- probe(8), kpartx(8) or reboot the
system.</p>

<p>Up Arrow</p>

<p>Down Arrow Move cursor to the previous or next
partition. If there are more partitions than can be
displayed on a screen, you can dis- play the next (previous)
set of partitions by moving down (up) at the last (first)
partition displayed on the screen.</p>

<p>CTRL-L Redraws the screen. In case something goes wrong
and you cannot read anything, you can refresh the screen
from the main command line.</p>

<p>? Print the help screen.</p>

<p>All of the commands can be entered with either upper or
lower case let- ters (except for Writes). When in a sub-menu
or at a prompt to enter a filename, you can hit the ESC key
to return to the main command line.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -a Use an arrow cursor instead of reverse video
for highlighting the current partition.</p>

<p>-g Do not use the geometry given by the disk driver, but
try to guess a geometry from the partition table.</p>

<p>-v Print the version number and copyright.</p>

<p>-z Start with zeroed partition table. This option is
useful when you want to repartition your entire disk. Note:
this option does not zero the partition table on the disk;
rather, it simply starts the program without reading the
existing partition table.</p>

<p>-c cylinders</p>

<p>-h heads</p>

<p>-s sectors-per-track Override the number of cylinders,
heads and sectors per track read from the BIOS. If your BIOS
or adapter does not supply this information or if it
supplies incorrect information, use these options to set the
disk geometry values.</p>

<p>-P opt Prints the partition table in specified formats.
opt can be one or more of &quot;r&quot;, &quot;s&quot; or
&quot;t&quot;. See the print command (above) for more
information on the print formats.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS 0: No errors; 1: Invocation error; 2: I/O
error; 3: cannot get geome- try; 4: bad partition table on
disk.</p>
