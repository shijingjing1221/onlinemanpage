<p>TCSETATTR(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
TCSETATTR(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME tcsetattr - set the parameters associated with the
terminal</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;termios.h&gt;</p>

<p>int tcsetattr(int fildes, int optional_actions, const
struct termios *termios_p);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The tcsetattr() function shall set the
parameters associated with the terminal referred to by the
open file descriptor fildes (an open file descriptor
associated with a terminal) from the termios structure ref-
erenced by termios_p as follows:</p>

<p>* If optional_actions is TCSANOW, the change shall occur
immediately.</p>

<p>* If optional_actions is TCSADRAIN, the change shall
occur after all output written to fildes is transmitted.
This function should be used when changing parameters that
affect output.</p>

<p>* If optional_actions is TCSAFLUSH, the change shall
occur after all output written to fildes is transmitted, and
all input so far received but not read shall be discarded
before the change is made.</p>

<p>If the output baud rate stored in the termios structure
pointed to by termios_p is the zero baud rate, B0, the modem
control lines shall no longer be asserted. Normally, this
shall disconnect the line.</p>

<p>If the input baud rate stored in the termios structure
pointed to by termios_p is 0, the input baud rate given to
the hardware is the same as the output baud rate stored in
the termios structure.</p>

<p>The tcsetattr() function shall return successfully if it
was able to perform any of the requested actions, even if
some of the requested actions could not be performed. It
shall set all the attributes that the implementation
supports as requested and leave all the attributes not
supported by the implementation unchanged. If no part of the
request can be honored, it shall return -1 and set errno to
[EINVAL]. If the input and output baud rates differ and are
a combination that is not supported, neither baud rate shall
be changed. A subsequent call to tcgetattr() shall return
the actual state of the terminal device (reflecting both the
changes made and not made in the previous tcse- tattr()
call). The tcsetattr() function shall not change the values
found in the termios structure under any circumstances.</p>

<p>The effect of tcsetattr() is undefined if the value of
the termios structure pointed to by termios_p was not
derived from the result of a call to tcgetattr() on fildes;
an application should modify only fields and flags defined
by this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 between the call to
tcgetattr() and tcsetattr(), leaving all other fields and
flags unmodified.</p>

<p>No actions defined by this volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001, other than a call to tcsetattr() or a close of
the last file descriptor in the sys- tem associated with
this terminal device, shall cause any of the termi- nal
attributes defined by this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 to
change.</p>

<p>If tcsetattr() is called from a process which is a
member of a back- ground process group on a fildes
associated with its controlling termi- nal:</p>

<p>* If the calling process is blocking or ignoring SIGTTOU
signals, the operation completes normally and no signal is
sent.</p>

<p>* Otherwise, a SIGTTOU signal shall be sent to the
process group.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, 0 shall be
returned. Otherwise, -1 shall be returned and errno set to
indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The tcsetattr() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EBADF The fildes argument is not a valid file
descriptor.</p>

<p>EINTR A signal interrupted tcsetattr().</p>

<p>EINVAL The optional_actions argument is not a supported
value, or an attempt was made to change an attribute
represented in the termios structure to an unsupported
value.</p>

<p>ENOTTY The file associated with fildes is not a
terminal.</p>

<p>The tcsetattr() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EIO The process group of the writing process is
orphaned, and the writing process is not ignoring or
blocking SIGTTOU.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE If trying to change baud rates,
applications should call tcsetattr() then call tcgetattr()
in order to determine what baud rates were actu- ally
selected.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The tcsetattr() function can be interrupted in
the following situa- tions:</p>

<p>* It is interrupted while waiting for output to
drain.</p>

<p>* It is called from a process in a background process
group and SIGT- TOU is caught.</p>

<p>See also the RATIONALE section in tcgetattr().</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS Using an input baud rate of 0 to set
the input rate equal to the output rate may not necessarily
be supported in a future version of this volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001.</p>
