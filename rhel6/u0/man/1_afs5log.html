<p>NAME afs5log - AFS token initializer</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS afs5log [ [-v] [-5] [-k] [-p path]
[cell[=principal] ] ] [...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The afs5log command uses Kerberos to obtain
AFS tokens for the named cells. If no cell is named, tokens
are obtained for the local cell. If the principal name of
the afs service for the cell is known, the cell name may
also be given in the form cell=principal_name. Attempts are
made to obtain Kerberos IV credentials first, and if that
fails, afs5log will create Kerberos 5 (2b-style) tokens.</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS -v Turns on verbose mode. afs5log will print
debugging messages while it does its work. Use more than
once to get more detail.</p>

<p>-p path Determine which cell the specified path resides
in, and obtain tokens for that cell.</p>

<p>-s strategy Overrides the default token-setting strategy
(&quot;v4,524,2b,rxk5&quot;) with the named strategy.
Recognized strategy names include: rxk5 rxk5 (requires
OpenAFS 1.6 or later) 2b rxkad &quot;2b&quot; (requires
OpenAFS 1.2.8 or later)</p>

<p>-5 Skip attempts to use Kerberos IV and just use
2b-style tokens, which are only supported by OpenAFS 1.2.8
and later.</p>

<p>-k Skip attempts to use Kerberos IV and use rxk5-style
tokens, which are only supported by OpenAFS 1.6 and
later.</p>

<p>-n Assume that, if a cell name and a realm name differ
only by case, that the name of the AFS services principal
name doesnt include an instance.</p>

<p>BUGS Probably, but lets hope not. If you find any,
please file them in the bug database at
http://bugzilla.redhat.com/ against the &quot;pam_krb5&quot;
com- ponent.</p>
