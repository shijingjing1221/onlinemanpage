<p>MAKEINDEX(1L) MAKEINDEX(1L)</p>

<p>NAME makeindex - a general purpose,
formatter-independent index processor</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS makeindex [-c] [-g] [-i] [-l] [-o ind] [-p num]
[-q] [-r] [-s sfile] [-t log] [-L] [-T] [idx0 idx1
idx2...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The program makeindex is a general purpose
hierarchical index genera- tor; it accepts one or more input
files (often produced by a text for- matter such as TeX
(tex(1L)) or troff(1), sorts the entries, and pro- duces an
output file which can be formatted. The index can have up to
three levels (0, 1, and 2) of subitem nesting. The way in
which words are flagged for indexing within the main
document is specific to the formatter used; makeindex does
not automate the process of selecting these words. As the
output index is hierarchical, makeindex can be considered
complimentary to the awk(1)-based make.index(1L) system of
Bentley and Kernighan, which is specific to troff(1),
generates non- hierarchical indices, and employs a much
simpler syntax for indicating index entries. For
illustration of use with troff and TeX, see the section
EXAMPLES below.</p>

<p>The formats of the input and output files are specified
in a style file; by default, input is assumed to be a .idx
file, as generated by LaTeX.</p>

<p>Unless specified explicitly, the base name of the first
input file (idx0) is used to determine the names of other
files. For each input file name specified, a file of that
name is sought. If this file is not found and the file name
has no extension, the extension .idx is appended. If no file
with this name is found, makeindex aborts.</p>

<p>If exactly one input file was given and no explicit
style file was specified using -s, makeindex uses a file
with the extension .mst as default style file (when
present).</p>

<p>For important notes on how to select index keywords, see
the document by Lamport cited below. As an issue separate
from selecting index key- words, a systematic mechanism for
placing index terms in a document is suggested in Index
Preparation and Processing, a paper cited below.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -c Compress intermediate blanks (ignoring
leading and trailing blanks and tabs). By default, blanks in
the index key are retained.</p>

<p>-g Employ German word ordering in the index, in accord
with rules set forth in DIN 5007. By default, makeindex
employs a word ordering in which precedence is: symbols,
numbers, uppercase letters, lowercase letters. The sequence
in German word ordering is: symbols, lowercase letters,
uppercase let- ters, numbers. Additionally, this option
enables makeindex to recognize the German TeX-commands
{&quot;a, &quot;o, &quot;u and &quot;s} as {ae, oe, ue and
ss} during the sorting of the entries. The quote character
must be redefined in a style file (for exam- ple, redefine
quote as + ). If the quote character is not redefined,
makeindex will produce an error message and abort.</p>

<p>-i Take input from stdin. When this option is specified
and -o is not, output is written to stdout.</p>

<p>-l Letter ordering; by default, word ordering is used
(see the ORDERING section).</p>

<p>-o ind Employ ind as the output index file. By default,
the file name is created by appending the extension .ind to
the base name of the first input file (idx0).</p>

<p>-p num Set the starting page number of the output index
file to be num (useful when the index file is to be
formatted sepa- rately). The argument num may be numerical
or one of the following:</p>

<p>any The starting page is the last source page number
plus 1.</p>

<p>odd The starting page is the first odd page following
the last source page number.</p>

<p>even The starting page is the first even page following
the last source page number.</p>

<p>The last source page is obtained by searching backward
in the log file for the first instance of a number included
within paired square brackets ([...]). If a page number is
missing or the log file is not found, no attempt will be
made to set the starting page number. The source log file
name is deter- mined by appending the extension .log to the
base name of the first input file (idx0).</p>

<p>-q Quiet mode; send no messages to stderr. By default,
progress and error messages are sent to stderr as well as to
the tran- script file.</p>

<p>-r Disable implicit page range formation; page ranges
must be created by using explicit range operators; see
SPECIAL EFFECTS below. By default, three or more successive
pages are automatically abbreviated as a range (e.g. 1
5).</p>

<p>-s sty Employ sty as the style file (no default). The
environment variable INDEXSTYLE defines the path where the
style file should be found.</p>

<p>-t log Employ log as the transcript file. By default,
the file name is created by appending the extension .ilg to
the base name of the first input file (idx0).</p>

<p>-L sort based on locale settings. Not available on all
systems.</p>

<p>-T special support for Thai documents. Not available on
all sys- tems.</p>

<p>STYLE FILE The style file informs makeindex about the
format of the .idx input files and the intended format of
the final output file; examples appear below. This file can
reside anywhere in the path defined by the envi- ronment
variable INDEXSTYLE. The style file contains a list of
&lt;speci- fier, attribute&gt; pairs. There are two types of
specifiers: input and output. Pairs do not have to appear in
any particular order. A line begun by % is a comment. In the
following list of specifiers and arguments, &lt;string&gt;
is an arbitrary string delimited by double quotes
(&quot;...&quot;), &lt;char&gt; is a single letter embraced
by single quotes (...), and &lt;number&gt; is a nonnegative
integer. The maximum length of a &lt;string&gt; is 2048. A
literal backslash or quote must be escaped (by a backslash).
Anything not specified in the style file will be assigned a
default value, which is shown at the head of the rightmost
column.</p>

<p>INPUT STYLE SPECIFIERS actual &lt;char&gt;
&acute;@&acute; Symbol indicating that the next entry is to
appear in the output file.</p>

<p>arg_close &lt;char&gt; &acute;}&acute; Closing delimiter
for the index entry argu- ment.</p>

<p>arg_open &lt;char&gt; &acute;{&acute; Opening delimiter
for the index entry argu- ment.</p>

<p>encap &lt;char&gt; &acute;|&acute; Symbol indicating
that the rest of the argu- ment list is to be used as the
encapsulating command for the page number.</p>

<p>escape &lt;char&gt; &acute;\&acute; Symbol which escapes
the following letter, unless its preceding letter is escape.
Note: quote is used to escape the letter which imme- diately
follows it, but if it is preceded by escape, it is treated
as a ordinary character. These two symbols must be
distinct.</p>

<p>keyword &lt;string&gt; &quot;\indexentry&quot; Command
which tells makeindex that its argu- ment is an index
entry.</p>

<p>level &lt;char&gt; &acute;!&acute; Delimiter denoting a
new level of subitem.</p>

<p>quote &lt;char&gt; &acute;&quot;&acute; Note: quote is
used to escape the letter which immediately follows it, but
if it is preceded by escape, it is treated as a ordinary
charac- ter. These two symbols must be distinct.</p>

<p>range_close &lt;char&gt; &acute;)&acute; Closing
delimiter indicating the end of an explicit page range.</p>

<p>range_open &lt;char&gt; &acute;(&acute; Opening
delimiter indicating the beginning of an explicit page
range.</p>

(default: 16, equiva- lent to 2 tabs).</p>

<p>suffix_2p &lt;string&gt; &quot;&quot; Delimiter to
replace the range delimiter and the second page number of a
two page list. When present, it overrides delim_r. Example:
&quot;f.&quot;.</p>

<p>suffix_3p &lt;string&gt; &quot;&quot; Delimiter to
replace the range delimiter and the second page number of a
three page list. When present, it overrides delim_r and suf-
fix_mp. Example: &quot;ff.&quot;.</p>

<p>suffix_mp &lt;string&gt; &quot;&quot; Delimiter to
replace the range delimiter and the second page number of a
multiple page list (three or more pages). When present, it
over- rides delim_r. Example: &quot;f.&quot;.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES TeX EXAMPLE The following example shows a style
file called book.ist, which defines an index for a book
which can be formatted independently of the main source:</p>

<p>preamble &quot;\documentstyle[12pt]{book}
\begin{document} \begin{theindex} {\small0 postamble &quot;0
\end{theindex} \end{document}0</p>

<p>Assuming that a particular book style requires the index
(as well as any chapters) to start from an odd page number,
and that the input file is named foo.idx, the following
command line produces output in file footmp.ind:</p>

<p>makeindex -s book.ist -o footmp.ind -p odd foo</p>

<p>Here a non-default output file name is used to avoid
clobbering the output for the book itself (presumably
foo.dvi, which would have been the default name for the
index output file!).</p>

<p>TROFF EXAMPLE A sample control file for creating an
index, which we will assume resides in the file
sample.ist:</p>

<p>keyword &quot;IX:&quot; preamble &quot;.\</p>

<p>.2C .SH .ce INDEX .XS INDEX .XE .R .ps 9p .vs 11p .sp
.de I1 .ti 0.25i .. .de I2 .ti 0.5i ..&quot; postamble
&quot;0\ setpage_prefix &quot;0nr % &quot; setpage_suffix
&quot;&quot; group_skip &quot;0sp 1.0&quot; headings_flag 1
heading_prefix &quot;0IS0 heading_suffix &quot;0IE&quot;
item_0 &quot;0br0 item_1 &quot;0I10 item_2 &quot;0I20
item_01 &quot;0I10 item_x1 &quot;0I10 item_12 &quot;0I20
item_x2 &quot;0I20 delim_0 &quot;, &quot; delim_1 &quot;,
&quot; delim_2 &quot;, &quot; delim_r &quot;-&quot; delim_t
&quot;.&quot; encap_prefix &quot;\fB&quot; encap_infix
&quot;&quot; encap_suffix &quot;\fP&quot; indent_space
&quot;&quot; indent_length 0</p>

<p>The local macro package may require modification, as in
this example of an extension to the -ms macros (note that at
some sites, this macro should replace a pre-existing macro
of the same name):</p>

<p>. .de IX .ie \n(.z .tm IX: \$1 \$2 \$3 \$4 \$5 \$6 \$7
\$8 \$9 {\n(PN} .el \!.IX \$1 \$2 \$3 \$4 \$5 \$6 \$7 \$8
\$9 {\n(PN} ..</p>

<p>(note that the string {\n(PN} is separated from the rest
of the line by a tab. If your local macro package does not
contain this extension, just include those lines at the
beginning of your file. Here is a sim- ple troff(1) input
file, which we will assume is named sample.txt:</p>

<p>This is a sample file to test the <i>makeindex</i>(1L)
program, and see .IX {indexing!programs!C language} .IX
{makeindex@<i>makeindex</i>(1L)} .bp .rs .IX {Knuth} .IX
{typesetting!computer-aided} how well it functions in the
<i>troff</i>(1) environment.</p>

<p>Note that index entries are indicated by the .IX macro,
which causes the following text to be written to stdout
along with the current page number.</p>

<p>CREATING THE INDEX FILE IN THE BOURNE SHELL To create an
input file for makeindex, in the Bourne shell environment,
do the equivalent at your site of the command:</p>

<p>psroff -ms -Tpsc -t sample.txt &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;
sample.tmp</p>

<p>Some sites will require ditroff instead of psroff. To
filter out any genuine error messages, invoke grep(1):</p>

<p>grep ^IX: sample.tmp &gt; sample.idx</p>

<p>CREATING THE INDEX FILE USING UCSF ENHANCED
TROFF/TRANSCRIPT With UCSF Enhanced troff/TRANSCRIPT, the -I
option of psroff(1L) can produce both formatter output and
an index file:</p>

<p>psroff -ms -I sample.inp -Tpsc sample.txt</p>

<p>If it is wished to suppress the formatter output:</p>

<p>psroff -ms -I sample.inp -Tpsc -t sample.txt &gt;
/dev/null</p>

<p>COMPLETING THE INDEX Any of the above procedures leaves
the input for makeindex in sam- ple.inp. The next step is to
invoke makeindex:</p>

<p>makeindex -s sample.ist sample.idx</p>

<p>This leaves troff(1)-ready output in the file
sample.ind.</p>

<p>ORDERING By default, makeindex assumes word ordering; if
the -l option is in effect, letter ordering is used. In word
ordering, a blank precedes any letter in the alphabet,
whereas in letter ordering, it does not count at all. This
is illustrated by the following example:</p>

<p>word order letter order sea lion seal seal sea lion</p>

<p>Numbers are always sorted in numeric order. For
instance,</p>

<p>9 (nine), 123 10 (ten), see Derek, Bo</p>

<p>Letters are first sorted without regard to case; when
words are identi- cal, the uppercase version precedes its
lowercase counterpart.</p>

<p>A special symbol is defined here to be any character not
appearing in the union of digits and the English alphabetic
characters. Patterns starting with special symbols precede
numbers, which precede patterns starting with letters. As a
special case, a string starting with a digit but mixed with
non-digits is considered to be a pattern starting with a
special character.</p>

<p>SPECIAL EFFECTS Entries such as</p>

<p>indexentry{alpha}{1} indexentry{alpha!beta}{3}
indexentry{alpha!beta!gamma}{10}</p>

<p>in the input file will be converted to</p>

<p>item alpha, 1 item beta, 3 subitem gamma, 10</p>

<p>in the output index file. Notice that the level symbol
(!) is used above to delimit hierarchical levels.</p>

<p>It is possible to make an item appear in a designated
form by using the actual (@) operator. For instance,</p>

<p>indexentry{alpha@{it alpha}}{1}</p>

<p>will become</p>

<p>item {it alpha}, 1</p>

<p>after processing. The pattern preceding @ is used as
sort key, whereas the one following it is written to the
output file. Note that two appearances of the same key, one
with and one without the actual operator, are regarded as
distinct entries.</p>

<p>The item, subitem, and subsubitem fields may have
individual sort keys:</p>

<p>indexentry{aa@{it aa}!bb@{it bb}!cc@{it cc}}{1}</p>

<p>This will be converted to</p>

<p>item {it aa}, 1 item {it bb}, 3 subitem {it cc}, 10</p>

<p>It is possible to encapsulate a page number with a
designated command using the encap (|) operator:</p>

<p>indexentry{alpha|bold}{1}</p>

<p>will be converted to</p>

<p>l d item alpha, { 1 }</p>

<p>l d { n } w i l where, with a suitable definition for
TeX, l { e x p a n d t n}. In this example, the three output
attributes associated with page encapsulation encap_prefix,
encap_infix, and encap_suffix, correspond to backslash, left
brace, and right brace, respectively. This mecha- nism
allows page numbers to be set in different fonts. For
example, the page where the definition of a keyword appears
can be in one font, the location of a primary example can be
in another font, and other appearances in yet a third
font.</p>

<p>The encap operator can also be used to create cross
references in the index:</p>

<p>indexentry{alpha|see{beta}}{1}</p>

<p>will become</p>

<p>item alpha, {beta}{1}</p>

<p>in the output file, where</p>

<p>{beta}{1}</p>

<p>will expand to</p>

<p>{it see} beta</p>

<p>Note that in a cross reference like this the page number
disappears.</p>

<p>A pair of encap concatenated with range_open (|( ) and
range_close (|)) creates an explicit page range:</p>

<p>indexentry{alpha|(}{1} indexentry{alpha|)}{5}</p>

<p>will become</p>

<p>item alpha, 15</p>

<p>Intermediate pages indexed by the same key will be
merged into the range implicitly. This is especially useful
when an entire section about a particular subject is to be
indexed, in which case only the range opening and closing
operators need to be inserted at the begin- ning and end of
the section. Explicit page range formation can also include
an extra command to set the page range in a designated
font:</p>

<p>indexentry{alpha|(bold}{1} indexentry{alpha|)}{5}</p>

<p>will become</p>

<p>l d { 1 item alpha, - - 5 }</p>

<p>Several potential problems are worth mentioning. First,
entries like</p>

<p>indexentry{alpha|(}{1} indexentry{alpha|bold}{3}
indexentry{alpha|)}{5}</p>

<p>will be interpreted as</p>

<p>l d { 3 } item alpha, , 1 - - 5</p>

<p>but with a warning message in the transcript about
encountering an inconsistent page encapsulator. An explicit
range beginning in a Roman page number and ending in Arabic
is also considered an error. In this instance, (if possible)
the range is broken into two subranges, one in Roman and the
other in Arabic. For instance,</p>

<p>indexentry{alpha|(}{i} indexentry{alpha}{iv}
indexentry{alpha}{3} indexentry{alpha|)}{7}</p>

<p>will be turned into</p>

<p>item alpha, i--iv, 3--7</p>

<p>with a warning message in the transcript file
complaining about an illegal range formation.</p>

<p>Finally, every special symbol mentioned in this section
may be escaped by the quote operator (&quot;). Thus</p>

<p>indexentry{alpha&quot;@beta}{1}</p>

<p>will actually become</p>

<p>item alpha@beta, 1</p>

<p>as a result of executing makeindex. The quoting power of
quote is eliminated if it is immediately preceded by escape
(). For example,</p>

<p>indexentry{f</p>

<p>becomes</p>

<p>item f</p>

<p>which represents an umlaut-accented u to the TeX family
of proces- sors.</p>

<p>From version 2.11 of makeindex, the quote operator may
quote any char- acter in the range 1 ... 255. Character 0 is
excluded because it is used internally in the makeindex
source code as a string terminator. With this change, sort
keys can be created for all eight-bit characters except 0.
The sorting order is</p>

<p>punctuation characters (in ASCII order), digits, control
characters (1 ... 31), space (32), letters (ignoring case),
characters 127 ... 255.</p>

<p>Here is an example showing the indexing of all printable
ASCII charac- ters other than letters and digits, assuming
the default TeX format. For convenience, the page number
references are the corresponding ASCII ordinal values.</p>

<p>indexentry{&quot; @&quot; (space)}{32}
indexentry{&quot;!@&quot;! (exclamation point)}{33}
indexentry{&quot;&quot;@&quot;&quot; (quotation mark)}{34}
indexentry{&quot;#@&quot; indexentry{&quot;$@&quot;(dollar
sign)}{36} indexentry{&quot;%@&quot; (percent sign)}{37}
indexentry{&quot;&amp;@&quot; (ampersand)}{38}
indexentry{&quot;&lt;@&quot;$&lt;$ (left angle bracket)}{60}
indexentry{&quot;=@&quot;= (equals)}{61}
indexentry{&quot;&gt;@&quot;$&gt;$ (right angle
bracket)}{62} indexentry{&quot;?@&quot;? (query)}{63}
indexentry{&quot;@@&quot;@ (at sign)}{64}
indexentry{&quot;[@&quot;[ (left square bracket)}{91}
indexentry{&quot;@&quot;b== (backslash)}{92}
indexentry{&quot;]@&quot;] (right square bracket)}{93}
indexentry{&quot;^@&quot;b=^= (caret)}{94}
indexentry{&quot;_@&quot;b=_= (underscore)}{95}
indexentry{&quot;@&quot;b=~= (grave accent)}{96}
indexentry{&quot;{@&quot;
indexentry{&quot;|@&quot;b=&quot;|= (vertical bar)}{124}
indexentry{&quot;}@&quot; indexentry{&quot;~@&quot;b=~=
(tilde)}{126}</p>

<p>Characters in the actual fields following the @
character which have special significance to TeX must be
represented as control sequences, or as math mode
characters. Note particularly how the entries for the at
sign, left and right braces, and the vertical bar, are
coded. The index file output by makeindex for this example
looks like this:</p>

<p>g i n {index} t h</p>

<p>item ! (exclamation point), 33 item &quot; (quotation
mark), 34 item item (dollar sign), 36 item (percent sign),
37 item (ampersand), 38 item $&lt;$ (left angle bracket), 60
item = (equals), 61 item $&gt;$ (right angle bracket), 62
item ? (query), 63 item @ (at sign), 64 item [ (left square
bracket), 91 item b== (backslash), 92 item ] (right square
bracket), 93 item b=^= (caret), 94 item b=_= (underscore),
95 item b=~= (grave accent), 96 item (left brace), 123 item
b=|= (vertical bar), 124 item (right brace), 125 item b=~=
(tilde), 126</p>

<p>indexspace</p>
