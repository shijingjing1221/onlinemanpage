<p>NAME pcap-linktype - link-layer header types supported
by libpcap</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION For a live capture or savefile, libpcap
supplies, as the return value of the pcap_datalink(3PCAP)
routine, a value that indicates the type of link-layer
header at the beginning of the packets it provides. This is
not necessarily the type of link-layer header that the
packets being captured have on the network from which theyre
being captured; for example, packets from an IEEE 802.11
network might be provided by libpcap with Ethernet headers
that the network adapter or the network adapter driver
generates from the 802.11 headers. The names for those
values begin with DLT_, so they are sometimes called
&quot;DLT_ values&quot;.</p>

<p>The values stored in the link-layer header type field in
the savefile header are, in most but not all cases, the same
as the values returned by pcap_datalink(). The names for
those values begin with LINKTYPE_.</p>

<p>The link-layer header types supported by libpcap are
listed here. The value corresponding to LINKTYPE_ names are
given; the value correspond- ing to DLT_ values are, in some
cases, platform dependent, and are not given; applications
should check for particular DLT_ values by name.</p>

<p>DLT_NULL; LINKTYPE_NULL=0 BSD loopback encapsulation;
the link-layer header is a 4-byte field, in host byte order,
containing a PF_ value from socket.h for the network-layer
protocol of the packet.</p>

<p>Note that host byte order is the byte order of the
machine on which the packets are captured, and the PF_
values are for the OS of the machine on which the packets
are cap- tured; if a live capture is being done, host byte
order is the byte order of the machine capturing the
packets, and the PF_ values are those of the OS of the
machine capturing the packets, but if a savefile is being
read, the byte order and PF_ values are not necessarily
those of the machine reading the capture file.</p>

<p>DLT_EN10MB; LINKTYPE_ETHERNET=1 Ethernet (10Mb, 100Mb,
1000Mb, and up); the 10MB in the DLT_ name is
historical.</p>

<p>DLT_IEEE802; LINKTYPE_TOKEN_RING=6 IEEE 802.5 Token
Ring; the IEEE802 in the DLT_ name is his- torical.</p>

<p>DLT_ARCNET; LINKTYPE_ARCNET=7 ARCNET</p>

<p>DLT_SLIP; LINKTYPE_SLIP=8 SLIP; the link-layer header
contains, in order:</p>

<p>a 1-byte flag, which is 0 for packets received by the
machine and 1 for packets sent by the machine;</p>

<p>a 1-byte field, the upper 4 bits of which indicate the
type of packet, as per RFC 1144:</p>

<p>0x40 an unmodified IP datagram (TYPE_IP);</p>

<p>0x70 an uncompressed-TCP IP datagram (UNCOM-
PRESSED_TCP), with that byte being the first byte of the raw
IP header on the wire, con- taining the connection number in
the protocol field;</p>

<p>0x80 a compressed-TCP IP datagram (COMPRESSED_TCP), with
that byte being the first byte of the compressed TCP/IP
datagram header;</p>

<p>for UNCOMPRESSED_TCP, the rest of the modified IP
header, and for COMPRESSED_TCP, the compressed TCP/IP
datagram header;</p>

<p>for a total of 16 bytes; the uncompressed IP datagram
follows the header.</p>

<p>DLT_PPP; LINKTYPE_PPP=9 PPP; if the first 2 bytes are
0xff and 0x03, its PPP in HDLC-like framing, with the PPP
header following those two bytes, otherwise its PPP without
framing, and the packet begins with the PPP header.</p>

<p>DLT_FDDI; LINKTYPE_FDDI=10 FDDI</p>

<p>DLT_ATM_RFC1483; LINKTYPE_ATM_RFC1483=100 RFC 1483
LLC/SNAP-encapsulated ATM; the packet begins with an IEEE
802.2 LLC header.</p>

<p>DLT_RAW; LINKTYPE_RAW=101 raw IP; the packet begins with
an IP header.</p>

<p>DLT_PPP_SERIAL; LINKTYPE_PPP_HDLC=50 PPP in HDLC-like
framing, as per RFC 1662, or Cisco PPP with HDLC framing, as
per section 4.3.1 of RFC 1547; the first byte will be 0xFF
for PPP in HDLC-like framing, and will be 0x0F or 0x8F for
Cisco PPP with HDLC framing.</p>

<p>DLT_PPP_ETHER; LINKTYPE_PPP_ETHER=51 PPPoE; the packet
begins with a PPPoE header, as per RFC 2516.</p>

<p>DLT_C_HDLC; LINKTYPE_C_HDLC=104 Cisco PPP with HDLC
framing, as per section 4.3.1 of RFC 1547.</p>

<p>DLT_IEEE802_11; LINKTYPE_IEEE802_11=105 IEEE 802.11
wireless LAN</p>

<p>DLT_FRELAY; LINKTYPE_FRELAY=107 Frame Relay</p>

<p>DLT_LOOP; LINKTYPE_LOOP=108 OpenBSD loopback
encapsulation; the link-layer header is a 4-byte field, in
network byte order, containing a PF_ value from OpenBSD s
socket.h for the network-layer protocol of the packet.</p>

<p>Note that, if a savefile is being read, those PF_ values
are not necessarily those of the machine reading the capture
file.</p>

<p>DLT_LINUX_SLL; LINKTYPE_LINUX_SLL=113 Linux
&quot;cooked&quot; capture encapsulation; the link-layer
header contains, in order:</p>

<p>a 2-byte &quot;packet type&quot;, in network byte order,
which is one of:</p>

<p>0 packet was sent to us by somebody else</p>

<p>1 packet was broadcast by somebody else</p>

<p>2 packet was multicast, but not broadcast, by somebody
else</p>

<p>3 packet was sent by somebody else to somebody else</p>

<p>4 packet was sent by us</p>

<p>a 2-byte field, in network byte order, containing a
Linux ARPHRD_ value for the link-layer device type;</p>

<p>a 2-byte field, in network byte order, containing the
length of the link-layer address of the sender of the packet
(which could be 0);</p>

<p>an 8-byte field containing that number of bytes of the
link-layer address of the sender (if there are more than 8
bytes, only the first 8 are present, and if there are fewer
than 8 bytes, there are padding bytes after the address to
pad the field to 8 bytes);</p>

<p>a 2-byte field containing an Ethernet protocol type, in
network byte order, or containing 1 for Novell 802.3 frames
without an 802.2 LLC header or 4 for frames beginning with
an 802.2 LLC header.</p>

<p>DLT_LTALK; LINKTYPE_LTALK=104 Apple LocalTalk; the
packet begins with an AppleTalk LLAP header.</p>

<p>DLT_PFLOG; LINKTYPE_PFLOG=117 OpenBSD pflog; the
link-layer header contains a struct pfloghdr structure, as
defined by the host on which the file was saved. (This
differs from operating system to operating system and
release to release; there is nothing in the file to indicate
what the layout of that structure is.)</p>

<p>DLT_PRISM_HEADER; LINKTYPE_PRISM_HEADER=119 Prism
monitor mode information followed by an 802.11 header.</p>

<p>DLT_IP_OVER_FC; LINKTYPE_IP_OVER_FC=122 RFC 2625
