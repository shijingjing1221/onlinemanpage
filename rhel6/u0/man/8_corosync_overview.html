<p>COROSYNC_OVERVIEW(Corosync Cluster Engine Programmer s
ManCOROSYNC_OVERVIEW(8)</p>

<p>NAME corosync_overview - Corosync overview</p>

<p>OVERVIEW The corosync project is a project to implement
a production quality &quot;Revised BSD&quot; licensed
implementation of the most recent SA Forums Application
Interface Specification. The Application Interface Speci-
fication is a software API and policies which are used to
develop applications that maintain service during faults.
The API consists of Availability Management Framework (AMF)
which provides application failover, Cluster Membership
(CLM), Checkpointing (CKPT), Eventing (EVT), Messaging
(MSG), and Distributed Locking (DLOCK).</p>

<p>Currently Messaging is unimplemented.</p>

<p>Faults occur for various reasons:</p>

<p>* Application Faults</p>

<p>* Middleware Faults</p>

<p>* Operating System Faults</p>

<p>* Hardware Faults</p>

<p>The major focus of high availability in the past has
been to mask hard- ware faults. Faults in other components
of the system have gone unsolved until AIS. AIS can mask
many types of faults in applications, middleware, operating
systems, or even hardware by providing a simple framework
for allowing developers to create redundant applications.
These redundant applications can be distributed over
multiple nodes such that if any one node faults, another
node can recover.</p>

<p>Application programmers develop applications to
periodically record their state using the checkpointing
service. When an active application fails, a standby
application recovers the state of the application. This
technique, called stateful application failover, provides
the fun- damental difference between corosync and other
systems that have come before it. With stateful application
failover, the end-application user doesnt have to reload the
application or redial a telephone. The full state is
recorded, so the end-application user sees no interrup- tion
in service.</p>

<p>Because programmers can now distribute applications
across multiple processes or nodes, a mechanism must exist
for them to communicate. This mechanism is provided by two
services. The event service provides a publish/subscribe
model for events. The messaging service provides end to end
messaging. Finally a mechanism to synchronize access is pro-
vided by the distributed lock service.</p>

<p>The corosync project also provides a group messaging
toolkit called EVS. The EVS service implements a messaging
model known as Extended Virtual Synchrony. This model allows
one sender to transmit to many receivers. Certain guarantees
are provided for message and membership delivery which make
virtual synchrony ideal for developing distributed
applications.</p>

<p>QUICKSTART The corosync executive must be configured. In
the directory conf in the source distribution are several
files that must be copied to the /etc/corosync directory. If
corosync is packaged by a distro, this may be complete.</p>

<p>The directory contains the file corosync.conf. Please
read the corosync.conf(5) man page for details on the
configuration options. The corosync project will work out of
the box with the default configu- ration options, although
the administrator may desire different options.</p>

<p>The corosync executive uses cryptographic techniques to
ensure authen- ticity and privacy of the messages. In order
for corosync to be secure and operate, a private key must be
generated and shared to all proces- sors.</p>

<p>First generate the key on one of the nodes:</p>

<p>unix# corosync-keygen Corosync Cluster Engine
Authentication key generator. Gathering 1024 bits for key
from /dev/random. Press keys on your keyboard to generate
entropy. Writing corosync key to /etc/corosync/authkey.</p>

<p>After this operation, a private key will be in the file
/etc/corosync/authkey. This private key must be copied to
every pro- cessor in the cluster. If the private key isnt
the same for every node, those nodes with nonmatching
private keys will not be able to join the same
configuration.</p>

<p>Copy the key to some security transportable storage or
use ssh to transmit the key from node to node. Then install
the key with the com- mand:</p>

<p>unix#: install -D --group=0 --owner=0 --mode=0400
/path_to_authkey/authkey /etc/corosync/authkey</p>

<p>If a message &quot;Invalid digest&quot; appears from the
corosync executive, the keys are not consistent between
processors.</p>

<p>Finally run the corosync executive. If corosync is
packaged from a distro, it may be set to start on system
start. It may also be turned off by default in which case
the init script for corosync must be enabled.</p>

<p>After running aisexec, a list of all processors IP
addresses running the corosync executive and configured on
the same multicast address will appear. If they dont appear,
there may be a problem with multi- cast in the distro or
hardware. If this happens, participation in the corosync
mailing list may help solve the problem. The email address
is corosync@lists.osdl.org.</p>

<p>USING LIBRARIES The corosync AIS libraries have header
files which must be included in the developer s application.
Once the header file is included, the developer can
reference the AIS interfaces.</p>

<p>The corosync project recommends to distros to place
include files in /usr/include/corosync. The following
include lines must be added to the application to use each
of the following services:</p>

<p>#include &lt;corosync/saClm.h&gt; For the Cluster
Membership B.01.01 service.</p>

<p>#include &lt;corosync/saCkpt.h&gt; For the Checkpointing
B.01.01 service.</p>

<p>#include &lt;corosync/saEvt.h&gt; For the Eventing
B.01.01 service.</p>

<p>#include &lt;corosync/ais_amf.h&gt; For the AMF A.01.01
service.</p>

<p>The corosync project recommends to distros to place
library files in /usr/lib. The following link lines must be
added to the LDFLAGS sec- tion of the makefile.</p>

<p>-lsaClm For the Cluster Membership B.01.01 service</p>

<p>-lsaCkpt For the Checkpointing B.01.01 service</p>

<p>-lsaEvt For the Eventing B.01.01 service</p>

<p>-lsaAmf For the AMF A.01.01 service</p>

<p>-lais Specify this to get access to all AIS libraries
without specify- ing each library individually.</p>

<p>IPv6 The corosync project supports both IPv4 and IPv6
network addresses. The entire cluster must use either IPv4
or IPv6 for the cluster commu- nication mechanism. In order
to use IPv6, IPv6 addresses must be spec- ified in the
bindnetaddr and mcastaddr fields in the configuration file.
The nodeid field must also be set.</p>

<p>An example of this is: nodeid: 2 bindnetaddr:
fec0::1:a800:4ff:fe00:20 mcastaddr: ff05::1</p>

<p>To configure a host for IPv6, use the ifconfig program
to add inter- faces: box20: ifconfig eth0 add
fec0::1:a800:4ff:fe00:20/64 box30: ifconfig eth0 add
fec0::1:a800:4ff:fe00:30/64</p>

<p>If the /64 is not specified, a route for the IPv6
network will not be configured which will cause significant
problems. Make sure a route is available for IPv6
traffic.</p>

<p>ARCHITECTURE The AIS libraries are a thin IPC interface
to the corosync executive. The corosync executive provides
services for the SA Forum AIS libraries as well as the EVS
and CPG libraries.</p>

<p>The corosync executive uses the Totem extended virtual
synchrony proto- col. The advantage to the end user is
excellent performance character- istics and a proven
protocol with excellent reliability. This protocol connects
the processors in a configuration together so they may
commu- nicate.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The corosync executive process
uses four environment variables during startup. If these
environment variables are not set, defaults will be
used.</p>

<p>COROSYNC_MAIN_CONFIG_FILE This specifies the fully
qualified path to the corosync configu- ration file.</p>

<p>The default is /etc/corosync/corosync.conf.</p>

<p>COROSYNC_AMF_CONFIG_FILE This specifies the fully
qualified path to the corosync Avail- ability Management
Framework configuration file.</p>

<p>The default is /etc/corosync/amf.conf.</p>

<p>COROSYNC_DEFAULT_CONFIG_IFACE This specifies the LCRSO
that is used to parse the configuration file. This allows
other configuration file parsers to be imple- mented within
the system.</p>

<p>The default is to use the default corosync configuration
file parser which parses the format specified in
corosync.conf (5).</p>

<p>COROSYNC_TOTEM_AUTHKEY_FILE This specifies the fully
qualified path to the shared key used to authenticate and
encrypt data used within the Totem protocol.</p>

<p>The default is /etc/corosync/authkey.</p>

<p>SECURITY The corosync executive optionally encrypts all
messages sent over the network using the SOBER-128 stream
cipher. The corosync executive uses HMAC and SHA1 to
authenticate all messages. The corosync executive library
uses SOBER-128 as a pseudo random number generator. The EVS
library feeds the PRNG using the /dev/random Linux
device.</p>

<p>If membership messages can be captured by intruders, it
is possible to execute a denial of service attack on the
cluster. In this scenario, the cluster is likely already
compromised and a DOS attack is the least of the
administrations worries.</p>

<p>The security in corosync does not offer perfect forward
secrecy because the keys are reused. It may be possible for
an intruder by capturing packets in an automated fashion to
determine the shared key. No such automated attack has been
published as of yet. In this scenario, the cluster is likely
already compromised to allow the long-term capture of
transmitted data.</p>

<p>For security reasons, the corosync executive binary
should NEVER be setuid or setgid in the filesystem.</p>

<p>SAFTEST COMPLIANCE The corosync libraries are now nearly
compliant with every aspect of the SA Forum s AIS
specification. The AMF service, however, is not compliant
with the B.01.01 specification. The remaining services pass
most of the tests of the saftest suite against the B.01.01
specifica- tion.</p>

<p>BUGS The messaging service is partially implemented and
not suitable for deployment. The distributed locking service
is buggy and not suitable for deployment. The Availability
Management Framework is under devel- opment and not suitable
for deployment..</p>
