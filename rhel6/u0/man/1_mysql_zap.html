<p>NAME mysql_zap - kill processes that match a pattern</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS mysql_zap [-signal] [-?Ift] pattern</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION mysql_zap kills processes that match a
pattern. It uses the ps command and Unix signals, so it runs
on Unix and Unix-like systems.</p>

<p>Invoke mysql_zap like this:</p>

<p>shell&gt; mysql_zap [-signal] [-?Ift] pattern</p>

<p>A process matches if its output line from the ps command
contains the pattern. By default, mysql_zap asks for
confirmation for each process. Respond y to kill the
process, or q to exit mysql_zap. For any other response,
mysql_zap does not attempt to kill the process.</p>

<p>If the -signal option is given, it specifies the name or
number of the signal to send to each process. Otherwise,
mysql_zap tries first with TERM (signal 15) and then with
KILL (signal 9).</p>

<p>mysql_zap supports the following additional options:</p>

<p>&middot; --help, -?, -I</p>

<p>Display a help message and exit.</p>

<p>&middot; -f</p>

<p>Force mode. mysql_zap attempts to kill each process
without confirmation.</p>

<p>&middot; -t</p>

<p>Test mode. Display information about each process but do
not kill it.</p>
