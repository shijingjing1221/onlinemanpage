<p>WHO(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual WHO(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME who - display who is on the system</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS who [-mTu]</p>

<p>who [-mu]-s[-bHlprt][file]</p>

<p>who [-mTu][-abdHlprt][file]</p>

<p>who -q [file]</p>

<p>who am i</p>

<p>who am I</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The who utility shall list various pieces of
information about accessi- ble users. The domain of
accessibility is implementation-defined.</p>

<p>Based on the options given, who can also list the users
name, terminal line, login time, elapsed time since activity
occurred on the line, and the process ID of the command
interpreter for each current system user.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The who utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>The following options shall be supported. The
metavariables, such as &lt;line&gt;, refer to fields
described in the STDOUT section.</p>

<p>-a Process the implementation-defined database or named
file with the -b, -d, -l, -p, -r, -t, -T and -u options
turned on.</p>

<p>-b Write the time and date of the last reboot.</p>

<p>-d Write a list of all processes that have expired and
not been respawned by the init system process. The
&lt;exit&gt; field shall appear for dead processes and
contain the termination and exit values of the dead process.
This can be useful in determining why a process
terminated.</p>

<p>-H Write column headings above the regular output.</p>

<p>-l (The letter ell.) List only those lines on which the
system is waiting for someone to login. The &lt;name&gt;
field shall be LOGIN in such cases. Other fields shall be
the same as for user entries except that the &lt;state&gt;
field does not exist.</p>

<p>-m Output only information about the current
terminal.</p>

<p>-p List any other process that is currently active and
has been previously spawned by init.</p>

<p>-q (Quick.) List only the names and the number of users
currently logged on. When this option is used, all other
options shall be ignored.</p>

<p>-r Write the current run-level of the init process.</p>

<p>-s List only the &lt;name&gt;, &lt;line&gt;, and
&lt;time&gt; fields. This is the default case.</p>

<p>-t Indicate the last change to the system clock.</p>

<p>-T Show the state of each terminal, as described in the
STDOUT sec- tion.</p>

<p>-u Write &quot;idle time&quot; for each displayed user
in addition to any other information. The idle time is the
time since any activity occurred on the user s terminal. The
method of determining this is unspecified. This option shall
list only those users who are currently logged in. The
&lt;name&gt; is the user s login name. The &lt;line&gt; is
the name of the line as found in the directory /dev. The
&lt;time&gt; is the time that the user logged in. The
&lt;activity&gt; is the number of hours and minutes since
activity last occurred on that particular line. A dot
indicates that the terminal has seen activity in the last
minute and is therefore &quot;current&quot;. If more than
twenty-four hours have elapsed or the line has not been used
since boot time, the entry shall be marked &lt;old&gt;. This
field is useful when trying to determine whether a person is
working at the terminal or not. The &lt;pid&gt; is the
process ID of the users login process.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operands shall be supported:</p>

<p>am i, am I In the POSIX locale, limit the output to
describing the invoking user, equivalent to the -m option.
The am and i or I must be separate arguments.</p>

<p>file Specify a pathname of a file to substitute for the
implementa- tion-defined database of logged-on users that
who uses by default.</p>

<p>STDIN Not used.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of who:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in
arguments).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>LC_TIME Determine the locale used for the format and
contents of the date and time strings.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>TZ Determine the timezone used when writing date and
time informa- tion. If TZ is unset or null, an unspecified
default timezone shall be used.</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT The who utility shall write its default format to
the standard output in an implementation-defined format,
subject only to the requirement of containing the
information described above.</p>

<p>XSI-conformant systems shall write the default
information to the stan- dard output in the following
general format:</p>


<p>&lt;name&gt;[&lt;state&gt;]&lt;line&gt;&lt;time&gt;[&lt;activity&gt;][&lt;pid&gt;][&lt;comment&gt;][&lt;exit&gt;]</p>

<p>The following format shall be used for the -T
option:</p>

<p>&quot;%s %c %s %n&quot; &lt;name&gt;, &lt;terminal
state&gt;, &lt;terminal name&gt;, &lt;time of login&gt;</p>

<p>where &lt;terminal state&gt; is one of the following
characters:</p>

<p>+ The terminal allows write access to other users.</p>

<p>- The terminal denies write access to other users.</p>

<p>? The terminal write-access state cannot be
determined.</p>

<p>In the POSIX locale, the &lt;time of login&gt; shall be
equivalent in format to the output of:</p>

<p>date +&quot;%b %e %H:%M&quot;</p>

<p>If the -u option is used with -T, the idle time shall be
added to the end of the previous format in an unspecified
format.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 Successful completion.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The name init used for the system
process is the most commonly used on historical systems, but
it may vary.</p>

<p>The &quot;domain of accessibility&quot; referred to is a
broad concept that per- mits interpretation either on a very
secure basis or even to allow a network-wide implementation
like the historical rwho.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE Due to differences between historical
implementations, the base options provided were a compromise
to allow users to work with those functions. The standard
developers also considered removing all the options, but
felt that these options offered users valuable
functionality. Addi- tional options to match historical
systems are available on XSI-confor- mant systems.</p>

<p>It is recognized that the who command may be of limited
usefulness, especially in a multi-level secure environment.
The standard developers considered, however, that having
some standard method of determining the
&quot;accessibility&quot; of other users would aid user
portability.</p>

<p>No format was specified for the default who output for
systems not sup- porting the XSI Extension. In such a
user-oriented command, designed only for human use, this was
not considered to be a deficiency.</p>

<p>The format of the terminal name is unspecified, but the
descriptions of ps, talk, and write require that they use
the same format.</p>

<p>It is acceptable for an implementation to produce no
output for an invocation of who mil.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
