<p>NAME pppd - Point-to-Point Protocol Daemon</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pppd [ options ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION PPP is the protocol used for establishing
internet links over dial-up modems, DSL connections, and
many other types of point-to-point links. The pppd daemon
works together with the kernel PPP driver to establish and
maintain a PPP link with another system (called the peer)
and to negotiate Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for each
end of the link. Pppd can also authenticate the peer and/or
supply authentication infor- mation to the peer. PPP can be
used with other network protocols besides IP, but such use
is becoming increasingly rare.</p>

<p>FREQUENTLY USED OPTIONS ttyname Use the serial port
called ttyname to communicate with the peer. If ttyname does
not begin with a slash (/), the string &quot;/dev/&quot; is
prepended to ttyname to form the name of the device to open.
If no device name is given, or if the name of the terminal
con- nected to the standard input is given, pppd will use
that termi- nal, and will not fork to put itself in the
background. A value for this option from a privileged source
cannot be overridden by a non-privileged user.</p>

<p>speed An option that is a decimal number is taken as the
desired baud rate for the serial device. On systems such as
4.4BSD and NetBSD, any speed can be specified. Other systems
(e.g. Linux, SunOS) only support the commonly-used baud
rates.</p>

<p>asyncmap map This option sets the
Async-Control-Character-Map (ACCM) for this end of the link.
The ACCM is a set of 32 bits, one for each of the ASCII
control characters with values from 0 to 31, where a 1 bit
indicates that the corresponding control character should
not be used in PPP packets sent to this system. The map is
encoded as a hexadecimal number (without a leading 0x) where
the least significant bit (00000001) represents character 0
and the most significant bit (80000000) represents character
31. Pppd will ask the peer to send these characters as a
2-byte escape sequence. If multiple asyncmap options are
given, the values are ORed together. If no asyncmap option
is given, the default is zero, so pppd will ask the peer not
to escape any control characters. To escape transmitted
characters, use the escape option.</p>

<p>auth Require the peer to authenticate itself before
allowing network packets to be sent or received. This option
is the default if the system has a default route. If neither
this option nor the noauth option is specified, pppd will
only allow the peer to use IP addresses to which the system
does not already have a route.</p>

<p>call name Read additional options from the file
/etc/ppp/peers/name. This file may contain privileged
options, such as noauth, even if pppd is not being run by
root. The name string may not begin with / or include .. as
a pathname component. The format of the options file is
described below.</p>

<p>connect script Usually there is something which needs to
be done to prepare the link before the PPP protocol can be
started; for instance, with a dial-up modem, commands need
to be sent to the modem to dial the appropriate phone
number. This option specifies an command for pppd to execute
(by passing it to a shell) before attempting to start PPP
negotiation. The chat (8) program is often useful here, as
it provides a way to send arbitrary strings to a modem and
respond to received characters. A value for this option from
a privileged source cannot be overridden by a non-privi-
leged user.</p>

<p>crtscts Specifies that pppd should set the serial port
to use hardware flow control using the RTS and CTS signals
in the RS-232 inter- face. If neither the crtscts, the
nocrtscts, the cdtrcts nor the nocdtrcts option is given,
the hardware flow control setting for the serial port is
left unchanged. Some serial ports (such as Macintosh serial
ports) lack a true RTS output. Such serial ports use this
mode to implement unidirectional flow control. The serial
port will suspend transmission when requested by the modem
(via CTS) but will be unable to request the modem to stop
sending to the computer. This mode retains the ability to
use DTR as a modem control line.</p>

<p>defaultroute Add a default route to the system routing
tables, using the peer as the gateway, when IPCP negotiation
is successfully completed. This entry is removed when the
PPP connection is broken. This option is privileged if the
nodefaultroute option has been spec- ified.</p>

<p>disconnect script Execute the command specified by
script, by passing it to a shell, after pppd has terminated
the link. This command could, for example, issue commands to
the modem to cause it to hang up if hardware modem control
signals were not available. The dis- connect script is not
run if the modem has already hung up. A value for this
option from a privileged source cannot be over- ridden by a
non-privileged user.</p>

<p>escape xx,yy,... Specifies that certain characters
should be escaped on transmis- sion (regardless of whether
the peer requests them to be escaped with its async control
character map). The characters to be escaped are specified
as a list of hex numbers separated by com- mas. Note that
almost any character can be specified for the escape option,
unlike the asyncmap option which only allows con- trol
characters to be specified. The characters which may not be
escaped are those with hex values 0x20 - 0x3f or 0x5e.</p>

<p>file name Read options from file name (the format is
described below). The file must be readable by the user who
has invoked pppd.</p>

<p>init script Execute the command specified by script, by
passing it to a shell, to initialize the serial line. This
script would typi- cally use the chat(8) program to
configure the modem to enable auto answer. A value for this
option from a privileged source cannot be overridden by a
non-privileged user.</p>

<p>lock Specifies that pppd should create a UUCP-style lock
file for the serial device to ensure exclusive access to the
device. By default, pppd will not create a lock file.</p>

<p>mru n Set the MRU [Maximum Receive Unit] value to n.
Pppd will ask the peer to send packets of no more than n
bytes. The value of n must be between 128 and 16384; the
default is 1500. A value of 296 works well on very slow
links (40 bytes for TCP/IP header + 256 bytes of data). Note
that for the IPv6 protocol, the MRU must be at least
1280.</p>

<p>mtu n Set the MTU [Maximum Transmit Unit] value to n.
Unless the peer requests a smaller value via MRU
negotiation, pppd will request that the kernel networking
code send data packets of no more than n bytes through the
PPP network interface. Note that for the IPv6 protocol, the
MTU must be at least 1280.</p>

<p>passive Enables the &quot;passive&quot; option in the
LCP. With this option, pppd will attempt to initiate a
connection; if no reply is received from the peer, pppd will
then just wait passively for a valid LCP packet from the
peer, instead of exiting, as it would with- out this
option.</p>

<p>OPTIONS
&lt;local_IP_address&gt;:&lt;remote_IP_address&gt; Set the
local and/or remote interface IP addresses. Either one may
be omitted. The IP addresses can be specified with a host
name or in decimal dot notation (e.g. 150.234.56.78). The
default local address is the (first) IP address of the
system (unless the noipdefault option is given). The remote
address will be obtained from the peer if not specified in
any option. Thus, in simple cases, this option is not
required. If a local and/or remote IP address is specified
with this option, pppd will not accept a different value
from the peer in the IPCP negotiation, unless the
ipcp-accept-local and/or ipcp-accept-remote options are
given, respectively.</p>

<p>ipv6
&lt;local_interface_identifier&gt;,&lt;remote_interface_identifier&gt;
Set the local and/or remote 64-bit interface identifier.
Either one may be omitted. The identifier must be specified
in standard ascii notation of IPv6 addresses (e.g.
::dead:beef). If the ipv6cp-use-ipaddr option is given, the
local identifier is the local IPv4 address (see above). On
systems which supports a unique persistent id, such as
EUI-48 derived from the Ethernet MAC address,
ipv6cp-use-persistent option can be used to replace the ipv6
&lt;local&gt;,&lt;remote&gt; option. Otherwise the
identifier is randomized.</p>

<p>active-filter filter-expression Specifies a packet
filter to be applied to data packets to determine which
packets are to be regarded as link activity, and therefore
reset the idle timer, or cause the link to be brought up in
demand-dialling mode. This option is useful in conjunc- tion
with the idle option if there are packets being sent or
received regularly over the link (for example, routing
informa- tion packets) which would otherwise prevent the
link from ever appearing to be idle. The filter-expression
syntax is as described for tcpdump(1), except that
qualifiers which are inap- propriate for a PPP link, such as
ether and arp, are not permit- ted. Generally the filter
expression should be enclosed in sin- gle-quotes to prevent
whitespace in the expression from being interpreted by the
shell. This option is currently only avail- able under
Linux, and requires that the kernel was configured to
include PPP filtering support (CONFIG_PPP_FILTER). Note that
it is possible to apply different constraints to incoming
and out- going packets using the inbound and outbound
qualifiers.</p>

<p>allow-ip address(es) Allow peers to use the given IP
address or subnet without authenticating themselves. The
parameter is parsed as for each element of the list of
allowed IP addresses in the secrets files (see the
AUTHENTICATION section below).</p>

<p>allow-number number Allow peers to connect from the
given telephone number. A trailing * character will match
all numbers beginning with the leading part.</p>

<p>bsdcomp nr,nt Request that the peer compress packets
that it sends, using the BSD-Compress scheme, with a maximum
code size of nr bits, and agree to compress packets sent to
the peer with a maximum code size of nt bits. If nt is not
specified, it defaults to the value given for nr. Values in
the range 9 to 15 may be used for nr and nt; larger values
give better compression but consume more kernel memory for
compression dictionaries. Alternatively, a value of 0 for nr
or nt disables compression in the corre- sponding direction.
Use nobsdcomp or bsdcomp 0 to disable BSD- Compress
compression entirely.</p>

<p>cdtrcts Use a non-standard hardware flow control (i.e.
DTR/CTS) to con- trol the flow of data on the serial port.
If neither the crtscts, the nocrtscts, the cdtrcts nor the
nocdtrcts option is given, the hardware flow control setting
for the serial port is left unchanged. Some serial ports
(such as Macintosh serial ports) lack a true RTS output.
Such serial ports use this mode to implement true
bi-directional flow control. The sacrifice is that this flow
control mode does not permit using DTR as a modem control
line.</p>

<p>chap-interval n If this option is given, pppd will
rechallenge the peer every n seconds.</p>

<p>chap-max-challenge n Set the maximum number of CHAP
challenge transmissions to n (default 10).</p>

<p>chap-restart n Set the CHAP restart interval
(retransmission timeout for chal- lenges) to n seconds
(default 3).</p>

<p>child-timeout n When exiting, wait for up to n seconds
for any child processes (such as the command specified with
the pty command) to exit before exiting. At the end of the
timeout, pppd will send a SIGTERM signal to any remaining
child processes and exit. A value of 0 means no timeout,
that is, pppd will wait until all child processes have
exited.</p>

<p>connect-delay n Wait for up to n milliseconds after the
connect script finishes for a valid PPP packet from the
peer. At the end of this time, or when a valid PPP packet is
received from the peer, pppd will commence negotiation by
sending its first LCP packet. The default value is 1000 (1
second). This wait period only applies if the connect or pty
option is used.</p>

<p>debug Enables connection debugging facilities. If this
option is given, pppd will log the contents of all control
packets sent or received in a readable form. The packets are
logged through syslog with facility daemon and level debug.
This information can be directed to a file by setting up
/etc/syslog.conf appro- priately (see syslog.conf(5)).</p>

<p>default-asyncmap Disable asyncmap negotiation, forcing
all control characters to be escaped for both the transmit
and the receive direction.</p>

<p>default-mru Disable MRU [Maximum Receive Unit]
negotiation. With this option, pppd will use the default MRU
value of 1500 bytes for both the transmit and receive
direction.</p>

<p>deflate nr,nt Request that the peer compress packets
that it sends, using the Deflate scheme, with a maximum
window size of 2**nr bytes, and agree to compress packets
sent to the peer with a maximum window size of 2**nt bytes.
If nt is not specified, it defaults to the value given for
nr. Values in the range 9 to 15 may be used for nr and nt;
larger values give better compression but consume more
kernel memory for compression dictionaries. Alternatively, a
value of 0 for nr or nt disables compression in the corre-
sponding direction. Use nodeflate or deflate 0 to disable
Deflate compression entirely. (Note: pppd requests Deflate
com- pression in preference to BSD-Compress if the peer can
do either.)</p>

<p>demand Initiate the link only on demand, i.e. when data
traffic is present. With this option, the remote IP address
must be speci- fied by the user on the command line or in an
options file. Pppd will initially configure the interface
and enable it for IP traffic without connecting to the peer.
When traffic is avail- able, pppd will connect to the peer
and perform negotiation, authentication, etc. When this is
completed, pppd will commence passing data packets (i.e., IP
packets) across the link.</p>

<p>The demand option implies the persist option. If this
behaviour is not desired, use the nopersist option after the
demand option. The idle and holdoff options are also useful
in conjuc- tion with the demand option.</p>

<p>domain d Append the domain name d to the local host name
for authentica- tion purposes. For example, if gethostname()
returns the name porsche, but the fully qualified domain
name is porsche.Quotron.COM, you could specify domain
Quotron.COM. Pppd would then use the name
porsche.Quotron.COM for looking up secrets in the secrets
file, and as the default name to send to the peer when
authenticating itself to the peer. This option is
privileged.</p>

<p>dryrun With the dryrun option, pppd will print out all
the option val- ues which have been set and then exit, after
parsing the command line and options files and checking the
option values, but before initiating the link. The option
values are logged at level info, and also printed to
standard output unless the device on standard output is the
device that pppd would be using to communicate with the
peer.</p>

<p>dump With the dump option, pppd will print out all the
option values which have been set. This option is like the
dryrun option except that pppd proceeds as normal rather
than exiting.</p>

<p>enable-session Enables session accounting via PAM or
wtwp/wtmpx, as appropri- ate. When PAM is enabled, the PAM
&quot;account&quot; and &quot;session&quot; mod- ule stacks
determine behavior, and are enabled for all PPP
authentication protocols. When PAM is disabled, wtmp/wtmpx
entries are recorded regardless of whether the peer name
identi- fies a valid user on the local system, making peers
visible in the last(1) log. This feature is automatically
enabled when the pppd login option is used. Session
accounting is disabled by default.</p>

<p>endpoint &lt;epdisc&gt; Sets the endpoint discriminator
sent by the local machine to the peer during multilink
negotiation to &lt;epdisc&gt;. The default is to use the MAC
address of the first ethernet interface on the system, if
any, otherwise the IPv4 address corresponding to the
hostname, if any, provided it is not in the multicast or
locally-assigned IP address ranges, or the localhost
address. The endpoint discriminator can be the string null
or of the form type:value, where type is a decimal number or
one of the strings local, IP, MAC, magic, or phone. The
value is an IP address in dotted-decimal notation for the IP
type, or a string of bytes in hexadecimal, separated by
periods or colons for the other types. For the MAC type, the
value may also be the name of an ethernet or similar network
interface. This option is currently only available under
Linux.</p>

<p>eap-interval n If this option is given and pppd
authenticates the peer with EAP (i.e., is the server), pppd
will restart EAP authentication every n seconds. For EAP
SRP-SHA1, see also the srp-interval option, which enables
lightweight rechallenge.</p>

<p>eap-max-rreq n Set the maximum number of EAP Requests to
which pppd will respond (as a client) without hearing EAP
Success or Failure. (Default is 20.)</p>

<p>eap-max-sreq n Set the maximum number of EAP Requests
that pppd will issue (as a server) while attempting
authentication. (Default is 10.)</p>

<p>eap-restart n Set the retransmit timeout for EAP
Requests when acting as a server (authenticator). (Default
is 3 seconds.)</p>

<p>eap-timeout n Set the maximum time to wait for the peer
to send an EAP Request when acting as a client
(authenticatee). (Default is 20 sec- onds.)</p>

<p>hide-password When logging the contents of PAP packets,
this option causes pppd to exclude the password string from
the log. This is the default.</p>

<p>holdoff n Specifies how many seconds to wait before
re-initiating the link after it terminates. This option only
has any effect if the persist or demand option is used. The
holdoff period is not applied if the link was terminated
because it was idle.</p>

<p>idle n Specifies that pppd should disconnect if the link
is idle for n seconds. The link is idle when no data packets
(i.e. IP pack- ets) are being sent or received. Note: it is
not advisable to use this option with the persist option
without the demand option. If the active-filter option is
given, data packets which are rejected by the specified
activity filter also count as the link being idle.</p>

<p>ipcp-accept-local With this option, pppd will accept the
peers idea of our local IP address, even if the local IP
address was specified in an option.</p>

<p>ipcp-accept-remote With this option, pppd will accept
the peers idea of its (remote) IP address, even if the
remote IP address was specified in an option.</p>

<p>ipcp-max-configure n Set the maximum number of IPCP
configure-request transmissions to n (default 10).</p>

<p>ipcp-max-failure n Set the maximum number of IPCP
configure-NAKs returned before starting to send
configure-Rejects instead to n (default 10).</p>

<p>ipcp-max-terminate n Set the maximum number of IPCP
terminate-request transmissions to n (default 3).</p>

<p>ipcp-restart n Set the IPCP restart interval
(retransmission timeout) to n sec- onds (default 3).</p>

<p>ipparam string Provides an extra parameter to the ip-up,
ip-pre-up and ip-down scripts. If this option is given, the
string supplied is given as the 6th parameter to those
scripts.</p>

<p>ipv6cp-max-configure n Set the maximum number of IPv6CP
configure-request transmissions to n (default 10).</p>

<p>ipv6cp-max-failure n Set the maximum number of IPv6CP
configure-NAKs returned before starting to send
configure-Rejects instead to n (default 10).</p>

<p>ipv6cp-max-terminate n Set the maximum number of IPv6CP
terminate-request transmissions to n (default 3).</p>

<p>ipv6cp-restart n Set the IPv6CP restart interval
(retransmission timeout) to n seconds (default 3).</p>

<p>ipx Enable the IPXCP and IPX protocols. This option is
presently only supported under Linux, and only if your
kernel has been configured to include IPX support.</p>

<p>ipx-network n Set the IPX network number in the IPXCP
configure request frame to n, a hexadecimal number (without
a leading 0x). There is no valid default. If this option is
not specified, the network number is obtained from the peer.
If the peer does not have the network number, the IPX
protocol will not be started.</p>

<p>ipx-node n:m Set the IPX node numbers. The two node
numbers are separated from each other with a colon
character. The first number n is the local node number. The
second number m is the peers node number. Each node number
is a hexadecimal number, at most 10 digits long. The node
numbers on the ipx-network must be unique. There is no valid
default. If this option is not specified then the node
numbers are obtained from the peer.</p>

<p>ipx-router-name &lt;string&gt; Set the name of the
router. This is a string and is sent to the peer as
information data.</p>

<p>ipx-routing n Set the routing protocol to be received by
this option. More than one instance of ipx-routing may be
specified. The none option (0) may be specified as the only
instance of ipx-routing. The values may be 0 for NONE, 2 for
RIP/SAP, and 4 for NLSP.</p>

<p>ipxcp-accept-local Accept the peer s NAK for the node
number specified in the ipx-node option. If a node number
was specified, and non-zero, the default is to insist that
the value be used. If you include this option then you will
permit the peer to override the entry of the node
number.</p>

<p>ipxcp-accept-network Accept the peer s NAK for the
network number specified in the ipx-network option. If a
network number was specified, and non- zero, the default is
to insist that the value be used. If you include this option
then you will permit the peer to override the entry of the
node number.</p>

<p>ipxcp-accept-remote Use the peer s network number
specified in the configure request frame. If a node number
was specified for the peer and this option was not
specified, the peer will be forced to use the value which
you have specified.</p>

<p>ipxcp-max-configure n Set the maximum number of IPXCP
configure request frames which the system will send to n.
The default is 10.</p>

<p>ipxcp-max-failure n Set the maximum number of IPXCP NAK
frames which the local sys- tem will send before it rejects
the options. The default value is 3.</p>

<p>ipxcp-max-terminate n Set the maximum nuber of IPXCP
terminate request frames before the local system considers
that the peer is not listening to them. The default value is
3.</p>

<p>kdebug n Enable debugging code in the kernel-level PPP
driver. The argu- ment values depend on the specific kernel
driver, but in general a value of 1 will enable general
kernel debug messages. (Note that these messages are usually
only useful for debugging the kernel driver itself.) For the
Linux 2.2.x kernel driver, the value is a sum of bits: 1 to
enable general debug messages, 2 to request that the
contents of received packets be printed, and 4 to request
that the contents of transmitted packets be printed. On most
systems, messages printed by the kernel are logged by
syslog(1) to a file as directed in the /etc/syslog.conf
configu- ration file.</p>

<p>ktune Enables pppd to alter kernel settings as
appropriate. Under Linux, pppd will enable IP forwarding
(i.e. set /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward to 1) if the
proxyarp option is used, and will enable the dynamic IP
address option (i.e. set /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_dynaddr to 1)
in demand mode if the local address changes.</p>

<p>lcp-echo-failure n If this option is given, pppd will
presume the peer to be dead if n LCP echo-requests are sent
without receiving a valid LCP echo-reply. If this happens,
pppd will terminate the connec- tion. Use of this option
requires a non-zero value for the lcp-echo-interval
parameter. This option can be used to enable pppd to
terminate after the physical connection has been broken
(e.g., the modem has hung up) in situations where no
hardware modem control lines are available.</p>

<p>lcp-echo-interval n If this option is given, pppd will
send an LCP echo-request frame to the peer every n seconds.
Normally the peer should respond to the echo-request by
sending an echo-reply. This option can be used with the
lcp-echo-failure option to detect that the peer is no longer
connected.</p>

<p>lcp-max-configure n Set the maximum number of LCP
configure-request transmissions to n (default 10).</p>

<p>lcp-max-failure n Set the maximum number of LCP
configure-NAKs returned before starting to send
configure-Rejects instead to n (default 10).</p>

<p>lcp-max-terminate n Set the maximum number of LCP
terminate-request transmissions to n (default 3).</p>

<p>lcp-restart n Set the LCP restart interval
(retransmission timeout) to n sec- onds (default 3).</p>

<p>linkname name Sets the logical name of the link to name.
Pppd will create a file named ppp-name.pid in /var/run (or
/etc/ppp on some sys- tems) containing its process ID. This
can be useful in deter- mining which instance of pppd is
responsible for the link to a given peer system. This is a
privileged option.</p>

<p>local Dont use the modem control lines. With this
option, pppd will ignore the state of the CD (Carrier
Detect) signal from the modem and will not change the state
of the DTR (Data Terminal Ready) signal. This is the
opposite of the modem option.</p>

<p>logfd n Send log messages to file descriptor n. Pppd
will send log mes- sages to at most one file or file
descriptor (as well as sending the log messages to syslog),
so this option and the logfile option are mutually
exclusive. The default is for pppd to send log messages to
stdout (file descriptor 1), unless the serial port is
already open on stdout.</p>

<p>logfile filename Append log messages to the file
filename (as well as sending the log messages to syslog).
The file is opened with the privileges of the user who
invoked pppd, in append mode.</p>

<p>login Use the system password database for
authenticating the peer using PAP, and record the user in
the system wtmp file. Note that the peer must have an entry
in the /etc/ppp/pap-secrets file as well as the system
password database to be allowed access. See also the
enable-session option.</p>

<p>maxconnect n Terminate the connection when it has been
available for network traffic for n seconds (i.e. n seconds
after the first network control protocol comes up).</p>

<p>maxfail n Terminate after n consecutive failed
connection attempts. A value of 0 means no limit. The
default value is 10.</p>

<p>modem Use the modem control lines. This option is the
default. With this option, pppd will wait for the CD
(Carrier Detect) signal from the modem to be asserted when
opening the serial device (unless a connect script is
specified), and it will drop the DTR (Data Terminal Ready)
signal briefly when the connection is ter- minated and
before executing the connect script. On Ultrix, this option
implies hardware flow control, as for the crtscts option.
This is the opposite of the local option.</p>

<p>mp Enables the use of PPP multilink; this is an alias
for the mul- tilink option. This option is currently only
available under Linux.</p>

<p>mppe-stateful Allow MPPE to use stateful mode. Stateless
mode is still attempted first. The default is to disallow
stateful mode.</p>

<p>mpshortseq Enables the use of short (12-bit) sequence
numbers in multilink headers, as opposed to 24-bit sequence
numbers. This option is only available under Linux, and only
has any effect if multilink is enabled (see the multilink
option).</p>

<p>mrru n Sets the Maximum Reconstructed Receive Unit to n.
The MRRU is the maximum size for a received packet on a
multilink bundle, and is analogous to the MRU for the
individual links. This option is currently only available
under Linux, and only has any effect if multilink is enabled
(see the multilink option).</p>

<p>ms-dns &lt;addr&gt; If pppd is acting as a server for
Microsoft Windows clients, this option allows pppd to supply
one or two DNS (Domain Name Server) addresses to the
clients. The first instance of this option specifies the
primary DNS address; the second instance (if given)
specifies the secondary DNS address. (This option was
present in some older versions of pppd under the name
dns-addr.)</p>

<p>ms-wins &lt;addr&gt; If pppd is acting as a server for
Microsoft Windows or &quot;Samba&quot; clients, this option
allows pppd to supply one or two WINS (Win- dows Internet
Name Services) server addresses to the clients. The first
instance of this option specifies the primary WINS address;
the second instance (if given) specifies the secondary WINS
address.</p>

<p>multilink Enables the use of the PPP multilink protocol.
If the peer also supports multilink, then this link can
become part of a bundle between the local system and the
peer. If there is an existing bundle to the peer, pppd will
join this link to that bundle, otherwise pppd will create a
new bundle. See the MULTILINK sec- tion below. This option
is currently only available under Linux.</p>

<p>name name Set the name of the local system for
authentication purposes to name. This is a privileged
option. With this option, pppd will use lines in the secrets
files which have name as the second field when looking for a
secret to use in authenticating the peer. In addition,
unless overridden with the user option, name will be used as
the name to send to the peer when authenticating the local
system to the peer. (Note that pppd does not append the
domain name to name.)</p>

<p>noaccomp Disable Address/Control compression in both
directions (send and receive).</p>

<p>noauth Do not require the peer to authenticate itself.
This option is privileged.</p>

<p>nobsdcomp Disables BSD-Compress compression; pppd will
not request or agree to compress packets using the
BSD-Compress scheme.</p>

<p>noccp Disable CCP (Compression Control Protocol)
negotiation. This option should only be required if the peer
is buggy and gets confused by requests from pppd for CCP
negotiation.</p>

<p>nocrtscts Disable hardware flow control (i.e. RTS/CTS)
on the serial port. If neither the crtscts nor the nocrtscts
nor the cdtrcts nor the nocdtrcts option is given, the
hardware flow control setting for the serial port is left
unchanged.</p>

<p>nocdtrcts This option is a synonym for nocrtscts. Either
of these options will disable both forms of hardware flow
control.</p>

<p>nodefaultroute Disable the defaultroute option. The
system administrator who wishes to prevent users from
creating default routes with pppd can do so by placing this
option in the /etc/ppp/options file.</p>

<p>nodeflate Disables Deflate compression; pppd will not
request or agree to compress packets using the Deflate
scheme.</p>

<p>nodetach Dont detach from the controlling terminal.
Without this option, if a serial device other than the
terminal on the stan- dard input is specified, pppd will
fork to become a background process.</p>

<p>noendpoint Disables pppd from sending an endpoint
discriminator to the peer or accepting one from the peer
(see the MULTILINK section below). This option should only
be required if the peer is buggy.</p>

<p>noip Disable IPCP negotiation and IP communication. This
option should only be required if the peer is buggy and gets
confused by requests from pppd for IPCP negotiation.</p>

<p>noipv6 Disable IPv6CP negotiation and IPv6
communication. This option should only be required if the
peer is buggy and gets confused by requests from pppd for
IPv6CP negotiation.</p>

<p>noipdefault Disables the default behaviour when no local
IP address is spec- ified, which is to determine (if
possible) the local IP address from the hostname. With this
option, the peer will have to sup- ply the local IP address
during IPCP negotiation (unless it specified explicitly on
the command line or in an options file).</p>

<p>noipx Disable the IPXCP and IPX protocols. This option
should only be required if the peer is buggy and gets
confused by requests from pppd for IPXCP negotiation.</p>

<p>noktune Opposite of the ktune option; disables pppd from
changing system settings.</p>

<p>nolock Opposite of the lock option; specifies that pppd
should not cre- ate a UUCP-style lock file for the serial
device. This option is privileged.</p>

<p>nolog Do not send log messages to a file or file
descriptor. This option cancels the logfd and logfile
options.</p>

<p>nomagic Disable magic number negotiation. With this
option, pppd cannot detect a looped-back line. This option
should only be needed if the peer is buggy.</p>

<p>nomp Disables the use of PPP multilink. This option is
currently only available under Linux.</p>

<p>nomppe Disables MPPE (Microsoft Point to Point
Encryption). This is the default.</p>

<p>nomppe-40 Disable 40-bit encryption with MPPE.</p>

<p>nomppe-128 Disable 128-bit encryption with MPPE.</p>

<p>nomppe-stateful Disable MPPE stateful mode. This is the
default.</p>

<p>nompshortseq Disables the use of short (12-bit) sequence
numbers in the PPP multilink protocol, forcing the use of
24-bit sequence numbers. This option is currently only
available under Linux, and only has any effect if multilink
is enabled.</p>

<p>nomultilink Disables the use of PPP multilink. This
option is currently only available under Linux.</p>

<p>nopcomp Disable protocol field compression negotiation
in both the receive and the transmit direction.</p>

<p>nopersist Exit once a connection has been made and
terminated. This is the default unless the persist or demand
option has been speci- fied.</p>

<p>nopredictor1 Do not accept or agree to Predictor-1
compression.</p>

<p>noproxyarp Disable the proxyarp option. The system
administrator who wishes to prevent users from creating
proxy ARP entries with pppd can do so by placing this option
in the /etc/ppp/options file.</p>

<p>noremoteip Allow pppd to operate without having an IP
address for the peer. This option is only available under
Linux. Normally, pppd will request the peers IP address, and
if the peer does not supply it, pppd will not bring up the
link for IP traffic. With this option, if the peer does not
supply its IP address, pppd will not ask the peer for it,
and will not set the destination address of the ppp
interface. In this situation, the ppp inter- face can be
used for routing by creating device routes, but the peer
itself cannot be addressed directly for IP traffic.</p>

<p>notty Normally, pppd requires a terminal device. With
this option, pppd will allocate itself a pseudo-tty
master/slave pair and use the slave as its terminal device.
Pppd will create a child pro- cess to act as a character
shunt to transfer characters between the pseudo-tty master
and its standard input and output. Thus pppd will transmit
characters on its standard output and receive characters on
its standard input even if they are not terminal devices.
This option increases the latency and CPU overhead of
transferring data over the ppp interface as all of the
characters sent and received must flow through the character
shunt process. An explicit device name may not be given if
this option is used.</p>

<p>novj Disable Van Jacobson style TCP/IP header
compression in both the transmit and the receive
direction.</p>

<p>novjccomp Disable the connection-ID compression option
in Van Jacobson style TCP/IP header compression. With this
option, pppd will not omit the connection-ID byte from Van
Jacobson compressed TCP/IP headers, nor ask the peer to do
so.</p>

<p>papcrypt Indicates that all secrets in the
/etc/ppp/pap-secrets file which are used for checking the
identity of the peer are encrypted, and thus pppd should not
accept a password which, before encryption, is identical to
the secret from the /etc/ppp/pap-secrets file.</p>

<p>pap-max-authreq n Set the maximum number of PAP
authenticate-request transmissions to n (default 10).</p>

<p>pap-restart n Set the PAP restart interval
(retransmission timeout) to n sec- onds (default 3).</p>

<p>pap-timeout n Set the maximum time that pppd will wait
for the peer to authen- ticate itself with PAP to n seconds
(0 means no limit).</p>

<p>pass-filter filter-expression Specifies a packet filter
to applied to data packets being sent or received to
determine which packets should be allowed to pass. Packets
which are rejected by the filter are silently discarded.
This option can be used to prevent specific network daemons
(such as routed) using up link bandwidth, or to provide a
very basic firewall capability. The filter-expression syntax
is as described for tcpdump(1), except that qualifiers which
are inappropriate for a PPP link, such as ether and arp, are
not permitted. Generally the filter expression should be
enclosed in single-quotes to prevent whitespace in the
expression from being interpreted by the shell. Note that it
is possible to apply different constraints to incoming and
outgoing packets using the inbound and outbound qualifiers.
This option is cur- rently only available under Linux, and
requires that the kernel was configured to include PPP
filtering support (CONFIG_PPP_FIL- TER).</p>

<p>password password-string Specifies the password to use
for authenticating to the peer. Use of this option is
discouraged, as the password is likely to be visible to
other users on the system (for example, by using ps(1)).</p>

<p>persist Do not exit after a connection is terminated;
instead try to reopen the connection. The maxfail option
still has an effect on persistent connections.</p>

<p>plugin filename Load the shared library object file
filename as a plugin. This is a privileged option. If
filename does not contain a slash (/), pppd will look in the
/usr/lib/pppd/version directory for the plugin, where
version is the version number of pppd (for example,
2.4.2).</p>

<p>predictor1 Request that the peer compress frames that it
sends using Pre- dictor-1 compression, and agree to compress
transmitted frames with Predictor-1 if requested. This
option has no effect unless the kernel driver supports
Predictor-1 compression.</p>

<p>privgroup group-name Allows members of group group-name
to use privileged options. This is a privileged option. Use
of this option requires care as there is no guarantee that
members of group-name cannot use pppd to become root
themselves. Consider it equivalent to putting the members of
group-name in the kmem or disk group.</p>

<p>proxyarp Add an entry to this system s ARP [Address
Resolution Protocol] table with the IP address of the peer
and the Ethernet address of this system. This will have the
effect of making the peer appear to other systems to be on
the local ethernet.</p>

<p>pty script Specifies that the command script is to be
used to communicate rather than a specific terminal device.
Pppd will allocate itself a pseudo-tty master/slave pair and
use the slave as its terminal device. The script will be run
in a child process with the pseudo-tty master as its
standard input and output. An explicit device name may not
be given if this option is used. (Note: if the record option
is used in conjuction with the pty option, the child process
will have pipes on its standard input and output.)</p>

<p>receive-all With this option, pppd will accept all
control characters from the peer, including those marked in
the receive asyncmap. With- out this option, pppd will
discard those characters as specified in RFC1662. This
option should only be needed if the peer is buggy.</p>

<p>record filename Specifies that pppd should record all
characters sent and received to a file named filename. This
file is opened in append mode, using the user s user-ID and
permissions. This option is implemented using a pseudo-tty
and a process to trans- fer characters between the
pseudo-tty and the real serial device, so it will increase
the latency and CPU overhead of transferring data over the
ppp interface. The characters are stored in a tagged format
with timestamps, which can be dis- played in readable form
using the pppdump(8) program.</p>

<p>remotename name Set the assumed name of the remote
system for authentication purposes to name.</p>

<p>remotenumber number Set the assumed telephone number of
the remote system for authentication purposes to number.</p>

<p>refuse-chap With this option, pppd will not agree to
authenticate itself to the peer using CHAP.</p>

<p>refuse-mschap With this option, pppd will not agree to
authenticate itself to the peer using MS-CHAP.</p>

<p>refuse-mschap-v2 With this option, pppd will not agree
to authenticate itself to the peer using MS-CHAPv2.</p>

<p>refuse-eap With this option, pppd will not agree to
authenticate itself to the peer using EAP.</p>

<p>refuse-pap With this option, pppd will not agree to
authenticate itself to the peer using PAP.</p>

<p>require-chap Require the peer to authenticate itself
using CHAP [Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol]
authentication.</p>

<p>require-mppe Require the use of MPPE (Microsoft Point to
Point Encryption). This option disables all other
compression types. This option enables both 40-bit and
128-bit encryption. In order for MPPE to successfully come
up, you must have authenticated with either MS-CHAP or
MS-CHAPv2. This option is presently only supported under
Linux, and only if your kernel has been configured to
include MPPE support.</p>

<p>require-mppe-40 Require the use of MPPE, with 40-bit
encryption.</p>

<p>require-mppe-128 Require the use of MPPE, with 128-bit
encryption.</p>

<p>require-mschap Require the peer to authenticate itself
using MS-CHAP [Microsoft Challenge Handshake Authentication
Protocol] authentication.</p>

<p>require-mschap-v2 Require the peer to authenticate
itself using MS-CHAPv2 [Microsoft Challenge Handshake
Authentication Protocol, Version 2] authentication.</p>

<p>require-eap Require the peer to authenticate itself
using EAP [Extensible Authentication Protocol]
authentication.</p>

<p>require-pap Require the peer to authenticate itself
using PAP [Password Authentication Protocol]
authentication.</p>

<p>show-password When logging the contents of PAP packets,
this option causes pppd to show the password string in the
log message.</p>

<p>silent With this option, pppd will not transmit LCP
packets to initiate a connection until a valid LCP packet is
received from the peer (as for the passive option with
ancient versions of pppd).</p>

<p>srp-interval n If this parameter is given and pppd uses
EAP SRP-SHA1 to authen- ticate the peer (i.e., is the
server), then pppd will use the optional lightweight SRP
rechallenge mechanism at intervals of n seconds. This option
is faster than eap-interval reauthentica- tion because it
uses a hash-based mechanism and does not derive a new
session key.</p>

<p>srp-pn-secret string Set the long-term
pseudonym-generating secret for the server. This value is
optional and if set, needs to be known at the server
(authenticator) side only, and should be different for each
server (or poll of identical servers). It is used along with
the current date to generate a key to encrypt and decrypt
the clients identity contained in the pseudonym.</p>

<p>srp-use-pseudonym When operating as an EAP SRP-SHA1
client, attempt to use the pseudonym stored in
~/.ppp_psuedonym first as the identity, and save in this
file any pseudonym offered by the peer during
authentication.</p>

<p>sync Use synchronous HDLC serial encoding instead of
asynchronous. The device used by pppd with this option must
have sync support. Currently supports Microgate SyncLink
adapters under Linux and FreeBSD 2.2.8 and later.</p>

<p>unit num Sets the ppp unit number (for a ppp0 or ppp1
etc interface name) for outbound connections.</p>

<p>updetach With this option, pppd will detach from its
controlling terminal once it has successfully established
the ppp connection (to the point where the first network
control protocol, usually the IP control protocol, has come
up).</p>

<p>usehostname Enforce the use of the hostname (with domain
name appended, if given) as the name of the local system for
authentication pur- poses (overrides the name option). This
option is not normally needed since the name option is
privileged.</p>

<p>usepeerdns Ask the peer for up to 2 DNS server
addresses. The addresses supplied by the peer (if any) are
passed to the /etc/ppp/ip-up script in the environment
variables DNS1 and DNS2, and the envi- ronment variable
USEPEERDNS will be set to 1. In addition, pppd will create
an /var/run/ppp/resolv.conf file containing one or two
nameserver lines with the address(es) supplied by the
peer.</p>

<p>user name Sets the name used for authenticating the
local system to the peer to name.</p>

<p>vj-max-slots n Sets the number of connection slots to be
used by the Van Jacob- son TCP/IP header compression and
decompression code to n, which must be between 2 and 16
(inclusive).</p>

<p>welcome script Run the executable or shell command
specified by script before initiating PPP negotiation, after
the connect script (if any) has completed. A value for this
option from a privileged source cannot be overridden by a
non-privileged user.</p>

<p>xonxoff Use software flow control (i.e. XON/XOFF) to
control the flow of data on the serial port.</p>

<p>OPTIONS FILES Options can be taken from files as well as
the command line. Pppd reads options from the files
/etc/ppp/options, ~/.ppprc and /etc/ppp/options.ttyname (in
that order) before processing the options on the command
line. (In fact, the command-line options are scanned to find
the terminal name before the options.ttyname file is read.)
In forming the name of the options.ttyname file, the initial
/dev/ is removed from the terminal name, and any remaining /
characters are replaced with dots.</p>

<p>An options file is parsed into a series of words,
delimited by whites- pace. Whitespace can be included in a
word by enclosing the word in double-quotes (&quot;). A
backslash ( quotes the following character. A hash (#)
starts a comment, which continues until the end of the line.
There is no restriction on using the file or call options
within an options file.</p>

<p>SECURITY pppd provides system administrators with
sufficient access control that PPP access to a server
machine can be provided to legitimate users without fear of
compromising the security of the server or the network it s
on. This control is provided through restrictions on which
IP addresses the peer may use, based on its authenticated
identity (if any), and through restrictions on which options
a non-privileged user may use. Several of pppd s options are
privileged, in particular those which permit potentially
insecure configurations; these options are only accepted in
files which are under the control of the system admin-
istrator, or if pppd is being run by root.</p>

<p>The default behaviour of pppd is to allow an
unauthenticated peer to use a given IP address only if the
system does not already have a route to that IP address. For
example, a system with a permanent connection to the wider
internet will normally have a default route, and thus all
peers will have to authenticate themselves in order to set
up a connec- tion. On such a system, the auth option is the
default. On the other hand, a system where the PPP link is
the only connection to the inter- net will not normally have
a default route, so the peer will be able to use almost any
IP address without authenticating itself.</p>

<p>As indicated above, some security-sensitive options are
privileged, which means that they may not be used by an
ordinary non-privileged user running a setuid-root pppd,
either on the command line, in the users ~/.ppprc file, or
in an options file read using the file option. Privileged
options may be used in /etc/ppp/options file or in an
options file read using the call option. If pppd is being
run by the root user, privileged options can be used without
restriction.</p>

<p>When opening the device, pppd uses either the invoking
users user ID or the root UID (that is, 0), depending on
whether the device name was specified by the user or the
system administrator. If the device name comes from a
privileged source, that is, /etc/ppp/options or an options
file read using the call option, pppd uses full root
privileges when opening the device. Thus, by creating an
appropriate file under /etc/ppp/peers, the system
administrator can allow users to establish a ppp connection
via a device which they would not normally have permis- sion
to access. Otherwise pppd uses the invoking user s real UID
when opening the device.</p>

<p>AUTHENTICATION Authentication is the process whereby one
peer convinces the other of its identity. This involves the
first peer sending its name to the other, together with some
kind of secret information which could only come from the
genuine authorized user of that name. In such an exchange,
we will call the first peer the &quot;client&quot; and the
other the &quot;server&quot;. The client has a name by which
it identifies itself to the server, and the server also has
a name by which it identifies itself to the client.
Generally the genuine client shares some secret (or pass-
word) with the server, and authenticates itself by proving
that it knows that secret. Very often, the names used for
authentication cor- respond to the internet hostnames of the
peers, but this is not essen- tial.</p>

<p>At present, pppd supports three authentication
protocols: the Password Authentication Protocol (PAP),
Challenge Handshake Authentication Pro- tocol (CHAP), and
Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP). PAP involves the
client sending its name and a cleartext password to the
server to authenticate itself. In contrast, the server
initiates the CHAP authentication exchange by sending a
challenge to the client (the challenge packet includes the
servers name). The client must respond with a response which
includes its name plus a hash value derived from the shared
secret and the challenge, in order to prove that it knows
the secret. EAP supports CHAP-style authentication, and also
includes the SRP-SHA1 mechanism, which is resistant to
dictionary-based attacks and does not require a cleartext
password on the server side.</p>

<p>The PPP protocol, being symmetrical, allows both peers
to require the other to authenticate itself. In that case,
two separate and indepen- dent authentication exchanges will
occur. The two exchanges could use different authentication
protocols, and in principle, different names could be used
in the two exchanges.</p>

<p>The default behaviour of pppd is to agree to
authenticate if requested, and to not require authentication
from the peer. However, pppd will not agree to authenticate
itself with a particular protocol if it has no secrets which
could be used to do so.</p>

<p>Pppd stores secrets for use in authentication in secrets
files (/etc/ppp/pap-secrets for PAP, /etc/ppp/chap-secrets
for CHAP, MS-CHAP, MS-CHAPv2, and EAP MD5-Challenge, and
/etc/ppp/srp-secrets for EAP SRP-SHA1). All secrets files
have the same format. The secrets files can contain secrets
for pppd to use in authenticating itself to other systems,
as well as secrets for pppd to use when authenticating other
systems to itself.</p>

<p>Each line in a secrets file contains one secret. A given
secret is specific to a particular combination of client and
server - it can only be used by that client to authenticate
itself to that server. Thus each line in a secrets file has
at least 3 fields: the name of the client, the name of the
server, and the secret. These fields may be followed by a
list of the IP addresses that the specified client may use
when connecting to the specified server.</p>

<p>A secrets file is parsed into words as for a options
file, so the client name, server name and secrets fields
must each be one word, with any embedded spaces or other
special characters quoted or escaped. Note that case is
significant in the client and server names and in the
secret.</p>

<p>If the secret starts with an @, what follows is assumed
to be the name of a file from which to read the secret. A
&quot;*&quot; as the client or server name matches any name.
When selecting a secret, pppd takes the best match, i.e. the
match with the fewest wildcards.</p>

<p>Any following words on the same line are taken to be a
list of accept- able IP addresses for that client. If there
are only 3 words on the line, or if the first word is
&quot;-&quot;, then all IP addresses are disal- lowed. To
allow any address, use &quot;*&quot;. A word starting with
&quot;!&quot; indi- cates that the specified address is not
acceptable. An address may be followed by &quot;/&quot; and
a number n, to indicate a whole subnet, i.e. all addresses
which have the same value in the most significant n bits. In
this form, the address may be followed by a plus sign
(&quot;+&quot;) to indicate that one address from the subnet
is authorized, based on the ppp net- work interface unit
number in use. In this case, the host part of the address
will be set to the unit number plus one.</p>

<p>Thus a secrets file contains both secrets for use in
authenticating other hosts, plus secrets which we use for
authenticating ourselves to others. When pppd is
authenticating the peer (checking the peers identity), it
chooses a secret with the peers name in the first field and
the name of the local system in the second field. The name
of the local system defaults to the hostname, with the
domain name appended if the domain option is used. This
default can be overridden with the name option, except when
the usehostname option is used. (For EAP SRP-SHA1, see the
srp-entry(8) utility for generating proper validator entries
to be used in the &quot;secret&quot; field.)</p>

<p>When pppd is choosing a secret to use in authenticating
itself to the peer, it first determines what name it is
going to use to identify itself to the peer. This name can
be specified by the user with the user option. If this
option is not used, the name defaults to the name of the
local system, determined as described in the previous
paragraph. Then pppd looks for a secret with this name in
the first field and the peer s name in the second field.
Pppd will know the name of the peer if CHAP or EAP
authentication is being used, because the peer will have
sent it in the challenge packet. However, if PAP is being
used, pppd will have to determine the peers name from the
options specified by the user. The user can specify the peer
s name directly with the remotename option. Otherwise, if
the remote IP address was specified by a name (rather than
in numeric form), that name will be used as the peers name.
Failing that, pppd will use the null string as the peers
name.</p>

<p>When authenticating the peer with PAP, the supplied
password is first compared with the secret from the secrets
file. If the password doesn t match the secret, the password
is encrypted using crypt() and checked against the secret
again. Thus secrets for authenticating the peer can be
stored in encrypted form if desired. If the papcrypt option
is given, the first (unencrypted) comparison is omitted, for
better security.</p>

<p>Furthermore, if the login option was specified, the
username and pass- word are also checked against the system
password database. Thus, the system administrator can set up
the pap-secrets file to allow PPP access only to certain
users, and to restrict the set of IP addresses that each
user can use. Typically, when using the login option, the
secret in /etc/ppp/pap-secrets would be &quot;&quot;, which
will match any pass- word supplied by the peer. This avoids
the need to have the same secret in two places.</p>

<p>Authentication must be satisfactorily completed before
IPCP (or any other Network Control Protocol) can be started.
If the peer is required to authenticate itself, and fails to
do so, pppd will termi- nated the link (by closing LCP). If
IPCP negotiates an unacceptable IP address for the remote
host, IPCP will be closed. IP packets can only be sent or
received when IPCP is open.</p>

<p>In some cases it is desirable to allow some hosts which
cant authenti- cate themselves to connect and use one of a
restricted set of IP addresses, even when the local host
generally requires authentication. If the peer refuses to
authenticate itself when requested, pppd takes that as
equivalent to authenticating with PAP using the empty string
for the username and password. Thus, by adding a line to the
pap-secrets file which specifies the empty string for the
client and password, it is possible to allow restricted
access to hosts which refuse to authenticate themselves.</p>

<p>ROUTING When IPCP negotiation is completed successfully,
pppd will inform the kernel of the local and remote IP
addresses for the ppp interface. This is sufficient to
create a host route to the remote end of the link, which
will enable the peers to exchange IP packets. Communica-
tion with other machines generally requires further
modification to routing tables and/or ARP (Address
Resolution Protocol) tables. In most cases the defaultroute
and/or proxyarp options are sufficient for this, but in some
cases further intervention is required. The /etc/ppp/ip-up
script can be used for this.</p>

<p>Sometimes it is desirable to add a default route through
the remote host, as in the case of a machine whose only
connection to the Internet is through the ppp interface. The
defaultroute option causes pppd to create such a default
route when IPCP comes up, and delete it when the link is
terminated.</p>

<p>In some cases it is desirable to use proxy ARP, for
example on a server machine connected to a LAN, in order to
allow other hosts to communi- cate with the remote host. The
proxyarp option causes pppd to look for a network interface
on the same subnet as the remote host (an interface
supporting broadcast and ARP, which is up and not a
point-to-point or loopback interface). If found, pppd
creates a permanent, published ARP entry with the IP address
of the remote host and the hardware address of the network
interface found.</p>

<p>When the demand option is used, the interface IP
addresses have already been set at the point when IPCP comes
up. If pppd has not been able to negotiate the same
addresses that it used to configure the interface (for
example when the peer is an ISP that uses dynamic IP address
assignment), pppd has to change the interface IP addresses
to the nego- tiated addresses. This may disrupt existing
connections, and the use of demand dialling with peers that
do dynamic IP address assignment is not recommended.</p>

<p>MULTILINK Multilink PPP provides the capability to
combine two or more PPP links between a pair of machines
into a single bundle , which appears as a single virtual PPP
link which has the combined bandwidth of the indi- vidual
links. Currently, multilink PPP is only supported under
Linux.</p>

<p>Pppd detects that the link it is controlling is
connected to the same peer as another link using the peer s
endpoint discriminator and the authenticated identity of the
peer (if it authenticates itself). The endpoint
discriminator is a block of data which is hopefully unique
for each peer. Several types of data can be used, including
locally- assigned strings of bytes, IP addresses, MAC
addresses, randomly strings of bytes, or E-164 phone
numbers. The endpoint discriminator sent to the peer by pppd
can be set using the endpoint option.</p>

<p>In some circumstances the peer may send no endpoint
discriminator or a non-unique value. The bundle option adds
an extra string which is added to the peer s endpoint
discriminator and authenticated identity when matching up
links to be joined together in a bundle. The bundle option
can also be used to allow the establishment of multiple
bundles between the local system and the peer. Pppd uses a
TDB database in /var/run/pppd2.tdb to match up links.</p>

<p>Assuming that multilink is enabled and the peer is
willing to negotiate multilink, then when pppd is invoked to
bring up the first link to the peer, it will detect that no
other link is connected to the peer and create a new bundle,
that is, another ppp network interface unit. When another
pppd is invoked to bring up another link to the peer, it
will detect the existing bundle and join its link to it.</p>

<p>If the first link terminates (for example, because of a
hangup or a received LCP terminate-request) the bundle is
not destroyed unless there are no other links remaining in
the bundle. Rather than exiting, the first pppd keeps
running after its link terminates, until all the links in
the bundle have terminated. If the first pppd receives a
SIGTERM or SIGINT signal, it will destroy the bundle and
send a SIGHUP to the pppd processes for each of the links in
the bundle. If the first pppd receives a SIGHUP signal, it
will terminate its link but not the bundle.</p>

<p>Note: demand mode is not currently supported with
multilink.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES The following examples assume that the
/etc/ppp/options file contains the auth option (as in the
default /etc/ppp/options file in the ppp distribution).</p>

<p>Probably the most common use of pppd is to dial out to
an ISP. This can be done with a command such as</p>

<p>pppd call isp</p>

<p>where the /etc/ppp/peers/isp file is set up by the
system administrator to contain something like this:</p>

<p>ttyS0 19200 crtscts connect /usr/sbin/chat -v -f
/etc/ppp/chat-isp noauth</p>

<p>In this example, we are using chat to dial the ISPs
modem and go through any logon sequence required. The
/etc/ppp/chat-isp file con- tains the script used by chat;
it could for example contain something like this:</p>

<p>ABORT &quot;NO CARRIER&quot; ABORT &quot;NO
DIALTONE&quot; ABORT &quot;ERROR&quot; ABORT &quot;NO
ANSWER&quot; ABORT &quot;BUSY&quot; ABORT
&quot;Username/Password Incorrect&quot; &quot;&quot;
&quot;at&quot; OK &quot;at&amp;d0&amp;c1&quot; OK
&quot;atdt2468135&quot; &quot;name:&quot;
&quot;^Umyuserid&quot; &quot;word:&quot;
&quot;qmypassword&quot; &quot;ispts&quot; &quot;q^Uppp&quot;
&quot;~-^Uppp-~&quot;</p>

<p>See the chat(8) man page for details of chat
scripts.</p>

<p>Pppd can also be used to provide a dial-in ppp service
for users. If the users already have login accounts, the
simplest way to set up the ppp service is to let the users
log in to their accounts and run pppd (installed
setuid-root) with a command such as</p>

<p>pppd proxyarp</p>

<p>To allow a user to use the PPP facilities, you need to
allocate an IP address for that users machine and create an
entry in /etc/ppp/pap-secrets, /etc/ppp/chap-secrets, or
/etc/ppp/srp-secrets (depending on which authentication
method the PPP implementation on the user s machine
supports), so that the users machine can authenticate
itself. For example, if Joe has a machine called
&quot;joespc&quot; that is to be allowed to dial in to the
machine called &quot;server&quot; and use the IP address
joespc.my.net, you would add an entry like this to
/etc/ppp/pap-secrets or /etc/ppp/chap-secrets:</p>

<p>joespc server &quot;joes secret&quot; joespc.my.net</p>

<p>(See srp-entry(8) for a means to generate the servers
entry when SRP-SHA1 is in use.) Alternatively, you can
create a username called (for example) &quot;ppp&quot;,
whose login shell is pppd and whose home directory is
/etc/ppp. Options to be used when pppd is run this way can
be put in /etc/ppp/.ppprc.</p>

<p>If your serial connection is any more complicated than a
piece of wire, you may need to arrange for some control
characters to be escaped. In particular, it is often useful
to escape XON (^Q) and XOFF (^S), using asyncmap a0000. If
the path includes a telnet, you probably should escape ^] as
well (asyncmap 200a0000). If the path includes an rlogin,
you will need to use the escape ff option on the end which
is running the rlogin client, since many rlogin
implementations are not transpar- ent; they will remove the
sequence [0xff, 0xff, 0x73, 0x73, followed by any 8 bytes]
from the stream.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS Messages are sent to the syslog daemon using
facility LOG_DAEMON. (This can be overridden by recompiling
pppd with the macro LOG_PPP defined as the desired
facility.) See the syslog(8) documentation for details of
where the syslog daemon will write the messages. On most
systems, the syslog daemon uses the /etc/syslog.conf file to
specify the destination(s) for syslog messages. You may need
to edit that file to suit.</p>

<p>The debug option causes the contents of all control
packets sent or received to be logged, that is, all LCP,
PAP, CHAP, EAP, or IPCP pack- ets. This can be useful if the
PPP negotiation does not succeed or if authentication fails.
If debugging is enabled at compile time, the debug option
also causes other debugging messages to be logged.</p>

<p>Debugging can also be enabled or disabled by sending a
SIGUSR1 signal to the pppd process. This signal acts as a
toggle.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The exit status of pppd is set to indicate
whether any error was detected, or the reason for the link
being terminated. The values used are:</p>

<p>0 Pppd has detached, or otherwise the connection was
successfully established and terminated at the peers
request.</p>

<p>1 An immediately fatal error of some kind occurred, such
as an essential system call failing, or running out of
virtual memory.</p>

<p>2 An error was detected in processing the options given,
such as two mutually exclusive options being used.</p>

<p>3 Pppd is not setuid-root and the invoking user is not
root.</p>

<p>4 The kernel does not support PPP, for example, the PPP
kernel driver is not included or cannot be loaded.</p>

<p>5 Pppd terminated because it was sent a SIGINT, SIGTERM
or SIGHUP signal.</p>

<p>6 The serial port could not be locked.</p>

<p>7 The serial port could not be opened.</p>

<p>8 The connect script failed (returned a non-zero exit
status).</p>

<p>9 The command specified as the argument to the pty
option could not be run.</p>

<p>10 The PPP negotiation failed, that is, it didnt reach
the point where at least one network protocol (e.g. IP) was
running.</p>

<p>11 The peer system failed (or refused) to authenticate
itself.</p>

<p>12 The link was established successfully and terminated
because it was idle.</p>

<p>13 The link was established successfully and terminated
because the connect time limit was reached.</p>

<p>14 Callback was negotiated and an incoming call should
arrive shortly.</p>

<p>15 The link was terminated because the peer is not
responding to echo requests.</p>

<p>16 The link was terminated by the modem hanging up.</p>

<p>17 The PPP negotiation failed because serial loopback
was detected.</p>

<p>18 The init script failed (returned a non-zero exit
status).</p>

<p>19 We failed to authenticate ourselves to the peer.</p>

<p>SCRIPTS Pppd invokes scripts at various stages in its
processing which can be used to perform site-specific
ancillary processing. These scripts are usually shell
scripts, but could be executable code files instead. Pppd
does not wait for the scripts to finish (except for the
ip-pre-up script). The scripts are executed as root (with
the real and effective user-id set to 0), so that they can
do things such as update routing tables or run privileged
daemons. Be careful that the contents of these scripts do
not compromise your system s security. Pppd runs the scripts
with standard input, output and error redirected to
/dev/null, and with an environment that is empty except for
some environment vari- ables that give information about the
link. The environment variables that pppd sets are:</p>

<p>DEVICE The name of the serial tty device being used.</p>

<p>IFNAME The name of the network interface being used.</p>

<p>IPLOCAL The IP address for the local end of the link.
This is only set when IPCP has come up.</p>

<p>IPREMOTE The IP address for the remote end of the link.
This is only set when IPCP has come up.</p>

<p>PEERNAME The authenticated name of the peer. This is
only set if the peer authenticates itself.</p>

<p>SPEED The baud rate of the tty device.</p>

<p>ORIG_UID The real user-id of the user who invoked
pppd.</p>

<p>PPPLOGNAME The username of the real user-id that invoked
pppd. This is always set.</p>

<p>For the ip-down and auth-down scripts, pppd also sets
the following variables giving statistics for the
connection:</p>

<p>CONNECT_TIME The number of seconds from when the PPP
negotiation started until the connection was terminated.</p>

<p>BYTES_SENT The number of bytes sent (at the level of the
serial port) dur- ing the connection.</p>

<p>BYTES_RCVD The number of bytes received (at the level of
the serial port) during the connection.</p>

<p>LINKNAME The logical name of the link, set with the
linkname option.</p>

<p>DNS1 If the peer supplies DNS server addresses, this
variable is set to the first DNS server address
supplied.</p>

<p>DNS2 If the peer supplies DNS server addresses, this
variable is set to the second DNS server address
supplied.</p>

<p>Pppd invokes the following scripts, if they exist. It is
not an error if they dont exist.</p>

<p>/etc/ppp/auth-up A program or script which is executed
after the remote system successfully authenticates itself.
It is executed with the parameters</p>

<p>interface-name peer-name user-name tty-device speed</p>

<p>Note that this script is not executed if the peer doesnt
authenticate itself, for example when the noauth option is
used.</p>

<p>/etc/ppp/auth-down A program or script which is executed
when the link goes down, if /etc/ppp/auth-up was previously
executed. It is executed in the same manner with the same
parameters as /etc/ppp/auth-up.</p>

<p>/etc/ppp/ip-pre-up A program or script which is executed
just before the ppp net- work interface is brought up. It is
executed with the same parameters as the ip-up script
(below). At this point the interface exists and has IP
addresses assigned but is still down. This can be used to
add firewall rules before any IP traffic can pass through
the interface. Pppd will wait for this script to finish
before bringing the interface up, so this script should run
quickly.</p>

<p>/etc/ppp/ip-up A program or script which is executed
when the link is available for sending and receiving IP
packets (that is, IPCP has come up). It is executed with the
parameters</p>

<p>interface-name tty-device speed local-IP-address
remote-IP-address ipparam</p>

<p>/etc/ppp/ip-down A program or script which is executed
when the link is no longer available for sending and
receiving IP packets. This script can be used for undoing
the effects of the /etc/ppp/ip-up and /etc/ppp/ip-pre-up
scripts. It is invoked in the same manner and with the same
parameters as the ip-up script.</p>

<p>/etc/ppp/ipv6-up Like /etc/ppp/ip-up, except that it is
executed when the link is available for sending and
receiving IPv6 packets. It is executed with the
parameters</p>

<p>interface-name tty-device speed local-link-local-address
remote-link-local-address ipparam</p>

<p>/etc/ppp/ipv6-down Similar to /etc/ppp/ip-down, but it
is executed when IPv6 pack- ets can no longer be transmitted
on the link. It is executed with the same parameters as the
ipv6-up script.</p>

<p>/etc/ppp/ipx-up A program or script which is executed
when the link is available for sending and receiving IPX
packets (that is, IPXCP has come up). It is executed with
the parameters</p>

<p>interface-name tty-device speed network-number
local-IPX-node-address remote-IPX-node-address
local-IPX-rout- ing-protocol remote-IPX-routing-protocol
local-IPX-router-name remote-IPX-router-name ipparam
pppd-pid</p>

<p>The local-IPX-routing-protocol and
remote-IPX-routing-protocol field may be one of the
following:</p>

<p>NONE to indicate that there is no routing protocol RIP
to indicate that RIP/SAP should be used NLSP to indicate
that Novell NLSP should be used RIP NLSP to indicate that
both RIP/SAP and NLSP should be used</p>

<p>/etc/ppp/ipx-down A program or script which is executed
when the link is no longer available for sending and
receiving IPX packets. This script can be used for undoing
the effects of the /etc/ppp/ipx-up script. It is invoked in
the same manner and with the same parameters as the ipx-up
script.</p>

<p>FILES /var/run/pppn.pid (BSD or Linux),
/etc/ppp/pppn.pid (others) Process-ID for pppd process on
ppp interface unit n.</p>

<p>/var/run/ppp-name.pid (BSD or Linux),
/etc/ppp/ppp-name.pid (others) Process-ID for pppd process
for logical link name (see the linkname option).</p>

<p>/var/run/pppd2.tdb Database containing information about
pppd processes, interfaces and links, used for matching
links to bundles in multilink oper- ation. May be examined
by external programs to obtain informa- tion about running
pppd instances, the interfaces and devices they are using,
IP address assignments, etc. /etc/ppp/pap-secrets Usernames,
passwords and IP addresses for PAP authentication. This file
should be owned by root and not readable or writable by any
other user. Pppd will log a warning if this is not the
case.</p>

<p>/etc/ppp/chap-secrets Names, secrets and IP addresses
for CHAP/MS-CHAP/MS-CHAPv2 authentication. As for
/etc/ppp/pap-secrets, this file should be owned by root and
not readable or writable by any other user. Pppd will log a
warning if this is not the case.</p>

<p>/etc/ppp/srp-secrets Names, secrets, and IP addresses
for EAP authentication. As for /etc/ppp/pap-secrets, this
file should be owned by root and not readable or writable by
any other user. Pppd will log a warning if this is not the
case.</p>

<p>~/.ppp_pseudonym Saved client-side SRP-SHA1 pseudonym.
See the srp-use-pseudonym option for details.</p>

<p>/etc/ppp/options System default options for pppd, read
before user default options or command-line options.</p>

<p>~/.ppprc User default options, read before
/etc/ppp/options.ttyname.</p>

<p>/etc/ppp/options.ttyname System default options for the
serial port being used, read after ~/.ppprc. In forming the
ttyname part of this filename, an initial /dev/ is stripped
from the port name (if present), and any slashes in the
remaining part are converted to dots.</p>

<p>/etc/ppp/peers A directory containing options files
which may contain privi- leged options, even if pppd was
invoked by a user other than root. The system administrator
can create options files in this directory to permit
non-privileged users to dial out without requiring the peer
to authenticate, but only to certain trusted peers.</p>

<p>NOTES Some limited degree of control can be exercised
over a running pppd process by sending it a signal from the
list below.</p>

<p>SIGINT, SIGTERM These signals cause pppd to terminate
the link (by closing LCP), restore the serial device
settings, and exit. If a connector or disconnector process
is currently running, pppd will send the same signal to its
process group, so as to terminate the connec- tor or
disconnector process.</p>

<p>SIGHUP This signal causes pppd to terminate the link,
restore the serial device settings, and close the serial
device. If the persist or demand option has been specified,
pppd will try to reopen the serial device and start another
connection (after the holdoff period). Otherwise pppd will
exit. If this signal is received during the holdoff period,
it causes pppd to end the holdoff period immediately. If a
connector or disconnector pro- cess is running, pppd will
send the same signal to its process group.</p>

<p>SIGUSR1 This signal toggles the state of the debug
option.</p>

<p>SIGUSR2 This signal causes pppd to renegotiate
compression. This can be useful to re-enable compression
after it has been disabled as a result of a fatal
decompression error. (Fatal decompression errors generally
indicate a bug in one or other implementation.)</p>
