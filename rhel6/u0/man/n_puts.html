<p>NAME puts - Write to a channel</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS puts ?-nonewline? ?channelId? string
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Writes the characters given by string to the
channel given by chan- nelId.</p>

<p>ChannelId must be an identifier for an open channel such
as a Tcl stan- dard channel (stdout or stderr), the return
value from an invocation of open or socket, or the result of
a channel creation command provided by a Tcl extension. The
channel must have been opened for output.</p>

<p>If no channelId is specified then it defaults to stdout.
Puts normally outputs a newline character after string, but
this feature may be sup- pressed by specifying the
-nonewline switch.</p>

<p>Newline characters in the output are translated by puts
to platform- specific end-of-line sequences according to the
current value of the -translation option for the channel
(for example, on PCs newlines are normally replaced with
carriage-return-linefeed sequences. See the fconfigure
manual entry for a discussion on ways in which fconfigure
will alter output.</p>

<p>Tcl buffers output internally, so characters written
with puts may not appear immediately on the output file or
device; Tcl will normally delay output until the buffer is
full or the channel is closed. You can force output to
appear immediately with the flush command.</p>

<p>When the output buffer fills up, the puts command will
normally block until all the buffered data has been accepted
for output by the operat- ing system. If channelId is in
nonblocking mode then the puts command will not block even
if the operating system cannot accept the data. Instead, Tcl
continues to buffer the data and writes it in the back-
ground as fast as the underlying file or device can accept
it. The application must use the Tcl event loop for
nonblocking output to work; otherwise Tcl never finds out
that the file or device is ready for more output data. It is
possible for an arbitrarily large amount of data to be
buffered for a channel in nonblocking mode, which could
consume a large amount of memory. To avoid wasting memory,
nonblocking I/O should normally be used in an event-driven
fashion with the fileevent command (do not invoke puts
unless you have recently been notified via a file event that
the channel is ready for more output data).</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Write a short message to the console (or
wherever stdout is directed): puts &quot;Hello,
World!&quot;</p>

<p>Print a message in several parts: puts -nonewline
&quot;Hello, &quot; puts &quot;World!&quot;</p>

<p>Print a message to the standard error channel: puts
stderr &quot;Hello, World!&quot;</p>

<p>Append a log message to a file: set chan [open my.log a]
set timestamp [clock format [clock seconds]] puts $chan
&quot;$timestamp - Hello, World!&quot; close $chan</p>
