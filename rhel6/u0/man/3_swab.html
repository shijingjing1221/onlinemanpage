<p>NAME swab - swap adjacent bytes</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #define _XOPEN_SOURCE #include
&lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>void swab(const void *from, void *to, ssize_t n);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The swab() function copies n bytes from the
array pointed to by from to the array pointed to by to,
exchanging adjacent even and odd bytes. This function is
used to exchange data between machines that have dif- ferent
low/high byte ordering.</p>

<p>This function does nothing when n is negative. When n is
positive and odd, it handles n-1 bytes as above, and does
something unspecified with the last byte. (In other words, n
should be even.)</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The swab() function returns no value.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO SVr4, 4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001.</p>
