<p>NAME jhat - Java Heap Analysis Tool</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS jhat [ options ] &lt;heap-dump-file&gt;</p>

<p>PARAMETERS options Options, if used, should follow
immediately after the command name.</p>

<p>heap-dump-file Java binary heap dump file to be browsed.
For a dump file that con- tains multiple heap dumps, you may
specify which dump in the file by appending
&quot;#&lt;number&gt; to the file name, i.e.
&quot;foo.hprof#3&quot;.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The jhat command parses a java heap dump
file and launches a webserver. jhat enables you to browse
heap dumps using your favorite webbrowser. jhat supports
pre-designed queries (such as show all instances of a known
class &quot;Foo&quot;) as well as OQL (Object Query
Language) - a SQL-like query language to query heap dumps.
Help on OQL is available from the OQL help page shown by
jhat. With the default port, OQL help is avail- able at
http://localhost:7000/oqlhelp/</p>

<p>There are several ways to generate a java heap dump:</p>

<p>* Use jmap -dump option to obtain a heap dump at
runtime;</p>

<p>* Use jconsole option to obtain a heap dump via
HotSpotDiagnos- ticMXBean @
http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/jre/api/management/exten-
sion/com/sun/management/HotSpotDiagnosticsMXBean.html at
runtime;</p>

<p>* Heap dump will be generated when OutOfMemoryError is
thrown by specifying -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError VM
option;</p>

<p>* Use hprof @
http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/Program-
ming/HPROF.html.</p>

<p>NOTE: This tool is experimental and may not be available
in future ver- sions of the JDK.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -stack false/true Turn off tracking object
allocation call stack. Note that if alloca- tion site
information is not available in the heap dump, you have to
set this flag to false. Default is true.</p>

<p>-refs false/true Turn off tracking of references to
objects. Default is true. By default, back pointers (objects
pointing to a given object a.k.a referrers or in-coming
references) are calculated for all objects in the heap.</p>

<p>-port port-number Set the port for the jhats HTTP
server. Default is 7000.</p>

<p>-exclude exclude-file Specify a file that lists data
members that should be excluded from the &quot;reachable
objects&quot; query. For example, if the file lists
java.lang.String.value, then, whenever list of objects
reachable from a specific object &quot;o&quot; are
calculated, reference paths involving java.lang.String.value
field will not considered.</p>

<p>-baseline baseline-dump-file Specify a baseline heap
dump. Objects in both heap dumps with the same object ID
will be marked as not being &quot;new&quot;. Other objects
will be marked as &quot;new&quot;. This is useful while
comparing two different heap dumps.</p>

<p>-debug int Set debug level for this tool. 0 means no
debug output. Set higher values for more verbose modes.</p>

<p>-version Report version number and exit.</p>

<p>-h Output help message and exit.</p>

<p>-help Output help message and exit.</p>

<p>-J&lt;flag&gt; Pass &lt;flag&gt; to the Java virtual
machine on which jhat is run. For example, -J-Xmx512m to use
a maximum heap size of 512MB.</p>
