<p>NAME XmTree - The Tree widget class</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;Xm/XTree.h&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The Tree widget is a container that shows
the relationship of its chil- dren in a graphical tree-like
format. Each child of the Tree widget is a node in the Tree.
The parent-child relationships between these nodes are
completely distinct from the widget hierarch.. The hierarchy
of nodes is created by specifying the tree
&quot;parent&quot; of each node as a con- straint resource.
If a nodes parent is NULL then it is assumed to be a root of
the tree. Although each widget can only have one parent, the
Tree widget supports adding more than one &quot;root&quot;
node to a single Tree.</p>

<p>Note: the Tree widget assumes that is will be totally
responsible for mapping and unmapping its children.
Therefore no child of this widget should ever modify its
mappedWhenManaged resource. If a child does mod- ify this
resource the behavior is undefined.</p>

<p>User Interaction Each node in the tree can be in four
states: open, closed, always open, and hidden. The state of
a node changes how it appears to the user and what actions
are available to the user.</p>

<p>Open This node will have an open folder shown to its
left that may be selected by the user to close this node.
When a node is open all of its children will be visible to
the user.</p>

<p>Closed This node will have a closed folder shown to its
left that may be selected by the user to open this node.
When a node is closed none of its children will be visible
to the user.</p>

<p>Always Open This node will have no folder button
associated with it. All of its children will be visible to
the user.</p>

<p>Hidden This node will not be shown to the user and all
of its children will appear and act exactly as if they were
children of this nodes parent. It will appear to the user as
if this node does not exist.</p>

<p>To maintain consistency of the user interface we have
found that it is bestto use the node state &quot;Always
Open&quot; for nodes with no children. This way the user
will only see a folder button next to a node that has
children to display. A folder button associated with a node
that has no children has no defined semantics.</p>

<p>Normal Resources Name Class Type Initial Value
connectStyle ConnectStyle unsigned char XmTreeDirect
horizontalNodeSpace Dimension HorizontalDimension 20
verticalNodeSpace Dimension VerticalDimension 2</p>

<p>All resource names begin with XmN and all resource class
names begin with XmC.</p>

<p>connectStyle The style of the lines visually connecting
parent nodes to children nodes. The valid styles are
XmTreeDirect or XmTreeLadder.</p>

<p>horizontalNodeSpace verticalNodeSpace The amount of
space between each node in the tree and it nearest neigh-
bor.</p>

<p>The following resources are inherited from the
XmHierarchy widget:</p>

<p>Name Class Type Initial Value autoClose AutoClose
Boolean True closeFolderPixmap Pixmap Pixmap
XmUNSPECIFIED_PIXMAP horizontalMargin Dimension
HorizontalDimension 2 openFolderPixmap Pixmap Pixmap
XmUNSPECIFIED_PIXMAP refigureMode Boolean Boolean True
verticalMargin Dimension VerticalDimension 2</p>

<p>All resource names begin with XmN and all resource class
names begin with XmC.</p>

<p>Constraint Resources Name Class Type Initial Value
openClosePadding OpenClosePadding Int 0 lineColor Foreground
Pixel &lt;dynamic&gt; lineWidth LineWidth Dimension 0</p>

<p>All resource names begin with XmN and all resource class
names begin with XmC. openClosePadding</p>

<p>The number of pixels between the folder button and the
node it is asso- ciated with.</p>

<p>lineColor The color of the line connecting a node to its
parent. The default value for this resource is the
foreground color of the Tree widget.</p>

<p>lineWidth The width of a connection line between a node
and its parent</p>

<p>The following constraint resources are inherited from
the XmHierarchy widget:</p>

<p>Name Class Type Initial Value insertBefore InsertBefore
Widget NULL nodeState NodeState XmHierarchyNodeState Open
parentNode ParentNode Widget NULL</p>

<p>All resource names begin with XmN and all resource class
names begin with XmC. Geometry Management:</p>

<p>The layout is performed by assigning each node a box
that is just large enough to con- tain itself and all of its
children. A recursive layout is then performed that centers
each node vertically in its box and at the extreme left
horizontally. The children s boxes are then placed to the
right of the node separated by the horizontalNodeSpace from
their parent, stacked above each other and separated by
verticalNodeSpace. This process is repeated recursively for
each child in the tree.</p>

<p>The preferred size of the entire tree will be just large
enough to con- tain all nodes in the hierarchy. As the state
of nodes change the tree will attempt to resize itself to
con- tain its current configuration. If the tree is forced
larger than the desired size the nodes will be centered
vertically and flush to the left edge of the tree widget. If
the tree is forced smaller, some nodes may be moved or drawn
outside the end of the tree. For this reason it is usually
desirable to put the tree into a Scrolled Window widget.</p>
