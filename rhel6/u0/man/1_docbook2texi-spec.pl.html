<p>DOCBOOK2TEXI-SPEC.PL(1) DOCBOOK2TEXI-SPEC.PL(1)</p>

<p>NAME docbook2texi-spec.pl - convert DocBook Booksto
Texinfo documents</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sgmlspl docbook2man-spec.pl</p>

<p>nsgmls [ sgml document ]| sgmlspl docbook2texi-spec.pl [
basename ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION docbook2texi is a sgmlspl spec file that
produces GNU Texinfo documents from DocBook documents.</p>

<p>The program reads ESIS produced by nsgmls (or other SGML
parsers) from standard input. Currently the document element
must be Book, otherwise the results are undefined.</p>

<p>Its output, the converted Texinfo document, is written
to standard out- put.</p>

<p>The file basename.refs will also be created, which
contains all the nodes in the document and their immediate
child nodes. As node pro- cessing always require forward
references, docbook2texi must be run twice for each
document: the first time to build the references, and the
second to actually generate a valid document.</p>

<p>REQUIREMENTS The SGMLSpm package from CPAN. This package
includes the sgmlspl script that is also needed.</p>

<p>LIMITATIONS Trying docbook2man on non-DocBook or
non-conformant SGML results in undefined behavior. :-)</p>

<p>This program is a slow, dodgy Perl script.</p>

<p>This program does not come close to supporting all the
possible markup in DocBook, and may produce wrong output in
some cases with supported markup.</p>

<p>TO DO &middot; How the hell do you represent a backslash
( in Texinfo!!@? Ive tried \ but TeX complains about it.</p>

<p>&middot; Fix breakages found in the test documents.</p>

<p>&middot; Add new element handling and fix existing
handling. Be robust.</p>

<p>&middot; Make it faster. I think most of the speed
problems so far is with parsing ESIS. Rewrite SGMLS.pm with
C and/or get input directly from SP.</p>

<p>&middot; There are some dependencies on elements
occurring when they are actu- ally optional (according to
the DTD). We need to fix that (prefer- ably) or prominently
state the requirements.</p>

<p>&middot; Allow other more common document elements.</p>

<p>&middot; Separate out node referencing to a separate
script. Not only would it make it faster/easier to maintain
because its separate from the main code, but also I would
like it to evolve into an automatic DocBook ToC
generator.</p>
