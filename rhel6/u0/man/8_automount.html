<p>AUTOMOUNT(8) AUTOMOUNT(8)</p>

<p>NAME automount - manage autofs mount points</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS automount [options] [master_map]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The automount program is used to manage
mount points for autofs, the inlined Linux automounter.
automount works by reading the auto.master(8) map and sets
up mount points for each entry in the mas- ter map allowing
them to be automatically mounted when accessed. The file
systems are then automatically umounted after a period of
inactiv- ity.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -h, --help Print brief help on program
usage.</p>

<p>-p, --pid-file Write the pid of the daemon to the
specified file.</p>

<p>-t, --timeout Set the global minimum timeout, in
seconds, until directories are unmounted. The default is 10
minutes. Setting the timeout to zero disables umounts
completely.</p>

<p>-n &lt;seconds&gt;, --negative-timeout &lt;seconds&gt;
Set the default timeout for caching failed key lookups. The
de- fault is 60 seconds.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose Enables logging of general status and
progress messages for all autofs managed mounts.</p>

<p>-d, --debug Enables logging of general status and
progress messages as well as debuging messages for all
autofs managed mounts.</p>

<p>-Dvariable=value Define a global macro substitution
variable. Global definitions are over-ridden macro
definitions of the same name specified in mount entries.</p>

<p>-f, --foreground Run the daemon in the forground and log
to stderr instead of syslog.&quot;</p>

<p>-r, --random-multimount-selection Enables the use of
ramdom selection when choosing a host from a list of
replicated servers.</p>

<p>-O, --global-options Allows the specification of global
mount options used for all master map entries. These options
will either replace or be ap- pened to options given in a
master map entry depending on the APPEND_OPTIONS
configuration setting.</p>

<p>-V, --version Display the version number, then exit.</p>

<p>-l, --set-log-priority priority path [path,...] Set the
daemon log priority to the specified value. Valid val- ues
include the numbers 0-7, or the strings emerg, alert, crit,
err, warning, notice, info, or debug. Log level debug will
log everything, log levels info, warn (or warning), or
notice with enable the daemon verbose logging. Any other
level will set ba- sic logging. Note that enabling debug or
verbose logging in the autofs global configuration will
override dynamic log level changes. For example, if verbose
logging is set in the configu- ration then attempting to set
logging to basic logging, by using alert, crit, err or emerg
won t stop the verbose logging. Howev- er, setting logging
to debug will lead to everything (debug log- ging) being
logged witch can then also be disabled, returning the daemon
to verbose logging. This option can be specified to change
the logging priority of an already running automount pro-
cess.</p>

<p>The path argument corresponds to the automounted path
name as specified in the master map.</p>

<p>-C, --dont-check-daemon Dont check if the daemon is
currently running (see NOTES).</p>

<p>-F, --force Force an unlink umount of existing mounts
under autofs managed mount points during startup. This can
cause problems for pro- cesses with working directories
within these mounts (see NOTES).</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS automount takes one optional argument, the
name of the master map to use.</p>

<p>master_map Location for autofs master map that defines
autofs managed mount points and the mount maps they will
use. The default is auto.master.</p>

<p>NOTES If the automount daemon catches a USR1 signal, it
will umount all cur- rently unused autofs managed mounted
file systems and continue running (forced expire). If it
catches the TERM signal it will umount all un- used autofs
managed mounted file systems and exit if there are no re-
maining busy file systems. If autofs has been compiled with
the option to ignore busy mounts on exit it will exit
leaving any busy mounts in place otherwise busy file systems
will not be umounted and autofs will not exit.
Alternatively, if autofs has been compiled with the option
to enable forced shutdown then a USR2 signal to the daemon
will cause all mounts to be umounted and any busy mounts to
be forcibly umounted, including autofs mount point
directories (summary execution). Note that the forced umount
is an unlink operation and the actual umount will not happen
in the kernel until active file handles are released. The
dae- mon also responds to a HUP signal which triggers an
update of the maps for each mount point.</p>

<p>If any autofs mount point directories are busy when the
daemon is sent an exit signal the daemon will not exit. The
exception to this is if autofs has been built with configure
options to either ignore busy mounts at exit or force umount
at exit. If the ignore busy mounts at exit option is used
the filesystems will be left in a catatonic (non-
functional) state and can be manually umounted when they
become unused. If the force umount at exit option is used
the filesystems will be umounted but the mount will not be
released by the kernel until they are no longer in use by
the processes that held them busy. If auto- mount managed
filesystems are found mounted when autofs is started they
will be recoverd unless they are no longer present in the
map in which case they need to umounted manually.</p>

<p>If the option to disable the check to see if the daemon
is already run- ning is used be aware that autofs currently
may not function correctly for certain types of automount
maps. The mounts of the seperate daemons might interfere
with one another. The implications of running multiple
daemon instances needs to be checked and tested before we
can say this is supported.</p>

<p>If the option to force an unlink of mounts at startup is
used then pro- cesses whose working directory is within
unlinked automounted directo- ries will not get the correct
pwd from the system. This is because, af- ter the mount is
unlinked from the mount tree, anything that needs to walk
back up the mount tree to construct a path, such as
getcwd(2) and the proc filesystem /proc/&lt;pid&gt;/cwd,
cannot work because the point from which the path is
constructed has been detached from the mount tree.</p>

<p>BUGS Dont know, Ive fixed everything I know about.</p>

<p>The documentation could be better.</p>
