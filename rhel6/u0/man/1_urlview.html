<p>NAME urlview - URL extractor/launcher</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS urlview filename [ filename ... ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION urlview is a screen oriented program for
extracting URLs from text files and displaying a menu from
which you may launch a command to view a specific item.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION urlview attempts to read ~/.urlview upon
startup. If this file doesnt exist, it will try to read a
system wide file in /etc/urlview.conf. There are two
configuration commands (order does not matter):</p>

<p>REGEXP regexp urlview uses a regular expression to
extract URLs from the spec- , , and are all converted to
ified text files. their normal printf(3) meanings. The
default REGEXP is:</p>

<p>(((https?|ftp|gopher)://|(mailto|file|news):)[^
&lt;&gt;&quot;]+|(www|web|w3).[-a-z0-9.]+)[^
.,;&lt;&gt;&quot;:]</p>

<p>COMMAND command If the specified command contains a %s,
it will be subsituted with the URL that was requested,
otherwise the URL is appended to the COMMAND string. The
default COMMAND is:</p>

<p>url_handler.sh %s</p>

<p>Note: You should never put single quotes around the %s.
urlview does this for you, and also makes sure that single
quotes eventually showing up inside the URL are handled
properly. (Note that this shouldnt hap- pen with the default
regular expression, which explicitly excludes sin- gle
quotes.)</p>

<p>FILES /etc/urlview.conf system-wide urlview
configuration file</p>

<p>~/.urlview urlview configuration file</p>
