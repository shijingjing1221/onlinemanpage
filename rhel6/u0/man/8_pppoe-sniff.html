<p>NAME pppoe-sniff - examine network for non-standard
PPPoE frames</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pppoe-sniff [options]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pppoe-sniff listens for likely-looking PPPoE
PADR and session frames and deduces extra options required
for pppoe(8) to work.</p>

<p>Some DSL providers seem to use non-standard frame types
for PPPoE frames, and/or require a certain value in the
Service-Name field. It is often easier to sniff those values
from a machine which can success- fully connect rather than
try to pry them out of the DSL provider.</p>

<p>To use pppoe-sniff, you need two computers, a DSL modem
and an Ethernet hub (not an Ethernet switch.)</p>

<p>If the DSL modem normally connects directly to your
computers Ethernet card, connect it to the
&quot;uplink&quot; port on the Ethernet hub. Plug two
computers into normal ports on the hub. On one computer, run
whatever software the DSL provider gave you on whatever
operating system the DSL provider supports. On the other
computer, run Linux and log in as root.</p>

<p>On the Linux machine, put the Ethernet interface into
promiscuous mode and start pppoe-sniff. If the ethernet
interface is eth0, for example, type these commands:</p>

<p>ifconfig eth0 promisc pppoe-sniff -I eth0</p>

<p>On the other machine, start your DSL connection as
usual. After a short time, pppoe-sniff should print
recommendations for the value of PPPOE_EXTRA. Set this value
in /etc/ppp/pppoe.conf. If pppoe-sniff indicates that
something special is required in PPPOE_EXTRA, please e- mail
this to pppoe@roaringpenguin.com along with the name of your
ISP and the manufacturer and model number of your DSL modem.
This informa- tion will be collated and provided on the
PPPoE web page for users who do not have two computers.</p>

<p>After pppoe-sniff finishes (or you stop it if it seems
hung), remember to turn off promiscuous mode:</p>

<p>ifconfig eth0 -promisc</p>

<p>OPTIONS -I interface The -I option specifies the
Ethernet interface to use. Under Linux, it is typically eth0
or eth1. The interface should be &quot;up&quot; and in
promiscuous mode before you start pppoe-sniff.</p>

<p>-V The -V option causes pppoe-sniff to print its version
number and exit.</p>

<p>BUGS pppoe-sniff only works on Linux.</p>
