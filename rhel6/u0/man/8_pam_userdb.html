<p>PAM_USERDB(8) Linux-PAM Manual PAM_USERDB(8)</p>

<p>NAME pam_userdb - PAM module to authenticate against a
db database</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pam_userdb.so db=/path/database [debug]
[crypt=[crypt|none]] [icase] [dump] [try_first_pass]
[use_first_pass] [unknown_ok] [key_only]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pam_userdb module is used to verify a
username/password pair against values stored in a Berkeley
DB database. The database is indexed by the username, and
the data fields corresponding to the username keys are the
passwords.</p>

<p>OPTIONS crypt=[crypt|none] Indicates whether encrypted
or plaintext passwords are stored in the database. If it is
crypt, passwords should be stored in the database in
crypt(3) form. If none is selected, passwords should be
stored in the database as plaintext.</p>

<p>db=/path/database Use the /path/database database for
performing lookup. There is no default; the module will
return PAM_IGNORE if no database is provided.</p>

<p>debug Print debug information.</p>

<p>dump Dump all the entries in the database to the log.
Don&acute;t do this by default!</p>

<p>icase Make the password verification to be case
insensitive (ie when working with registration numbers and
such). Only works with plaintext password storage.</p>

<p>try_first_pass Use the authentication token previously
obtained by another module that did the conversation with
the application. If this token can not be obtained then the
module will try to converse. This option can be used for
stacking different modules that need to deal with the
authentication tokens.</p>

<p>use_first_pass Use the authentication token previously
obtained by another module that did the conversation with
the application. If this token can not be obtained then the
module will fail. This option can be used for stacking
different modules that need to deal with the authentication
tokens.</p>

<p>unknown_ok Do not return error when checking for a user
that is not in the database. This can be used to stack more
than one pam_userdb module that will check a
username/password pair in more than a database.</p>

<p>key_only The username and password are concatenated
together in the database hash as
&acute;username-password&acute; with a random value. if the
concatenation of the username and password with a dash in
the middle returns any result, the user is valid. this is
useful in cases where the username may not be unique but the
username and password pair are.</p>

<p>MODULE TYPES PROVIDED The auth and account module types
are provided.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUES PAM_AUTH_ERR Authentication failure.</p>

<p>PAM_AUTHTOK_RECOVERY_ERR Authentication information
cannot be recovered.</p>

<p>PAM_BUF_ERR Memory buffer error.</p>

<p>PAM_CONV_ERR Conversation failure.</p>

<p>PAM_SERVICE_ERR Error in service module.</p>

<p>PAM_SUCCESS Success.</p>

<p>PAM_USER_UNKNOWN User not known to the underlying
authentication module.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES auth sufficient pam_userdb.so icase
db=/etc/dbtest.db</p>

<p>SEE ALSO crypt(3), pam.conf(5), pam.d(5), pam(8)</p>
