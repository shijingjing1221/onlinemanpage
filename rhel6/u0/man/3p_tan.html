<p>TAN(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual TAN(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME tan, tanf, tanl - tangent function</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;math.h&gt;</p>

<p>double tan(double x); float tanf(float x); long double
tanl(long double x);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION These functions shall compute the tangent of
their argument x, measured in radians.</p>

<p>An application wishing to check for error situations
should set errno to zero and call
feclearexcept(FE_ALL_EXCEPT) before calling these functions.
On return, if errno is non-zero or fetestexcept(FE_INVALID |
FE_DIVBYZERO | FE_OVERFLOW | FE_UNDERFLOW) is non-zero, an
error has occurred.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, these functions
shall return the tangent of x.</p>

<p>If the correct value would cause underflow, and is not
representable, a range error may occur, and either 0.0 (if
supported), or an implemen- tation-defined value shall be
returned.</p>

<p>If x is NaN, a NaN shall be returned.</p>

<p>If x is &plusmn;0, x shall be returned.</p>

<p>If x is subnormal, a range error may occur and x should
be returned.</p>

<p>If x is &plusmn;Inf, a domain error shall occur, and
either a NaN (if sup- ported), or an implementation-defined
value shall be returned.</p>

<p>If the correct value would cause underflow, and is
representable, a range error may occur and the correct value
shall be returned.</p>

<p>If the correct value would cause overflow, a range error
shall occur and tan(), tanf(), and tanl() shall return
&plusmn;HUGE_VAL, &plusmn;HUGE_VALF, and &plusmn;HUGE_VALL,
respectively, with the same sign as the correct value of the
function.</p>

<p>ERRORS These functions shall fail if:</p>

<p>Domain Error The value of x is &plusmn;Inf.</p>

<p>If the integer expression (math_errhandling &amp;
MATH_ERRNO) is non-zero, then errno shall be set to [EDOM].
If the integer expression (math_errhandling &amp;
MATH_ERREXCEPT) is non-zero, then the invalid floating-point
exception shall be raised.</p>

<p>Range Error The result overflows</p>

<p>If the integer expression (math_errhandling &amp;
MATH_ERRNO) is non-zero, then errno shall be set to
[ERANGE]. If the integer expression (math_errhandling &amp;
MATH_ERREXCEPT) is non-zero, then the overflow
floating-point exception shall be raised.</p>

<p>These functions may fail if:</p>

<p>Range Error The result underflows, or the value of x is
subnormal.</p>

<p>If the integer expression (math_errhandling &amp;
MATH_ERRNO) is non-zero, then errno shall be set to
[ERANGE]. If the integer expression (math_errhandling &amp;
MATH_ERREXCEPT) is non-zero, then the underflow
floating-point exception shall be raised.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Taking the Tangent of a 45-Degree Angle
#include &lt;math.h&gt; ... double radians = 45.0 * M_PI /
180; double result; ... result = tan (radians);</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE There are no known floating-point
representations such that for a nor- mal argument, tan( x)
is either overflow or underflow.</p>

<p>These functions may lose accuracy when their argument is
near a multi- ple of pi/2 or is far from 0.0.</p>

<p>On error, the expressions (math_errhandling &amp;
MATH_ERRNO) and (math_errhandling &amp; MATH_ERREXCEPT) are
independent of each other, but at least one of them must be
non-zero.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
