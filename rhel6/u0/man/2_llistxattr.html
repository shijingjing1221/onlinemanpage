<p>LISTXATTR(2) System calls LISTXATTR(2)</p>

<p>NAME listxattr, llistxattr, flistxattr - list extended
attribute names</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; #include
&lt;attr/xattr.h&gt;</p>

<p>ssize_t listxattr (const char *path, char *list, size_t
size); ssize_t llistxattr (const char *path, char *list,
size_t size); ssize_t flistxattr (int filedes, char *list,
size_t size);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Extended attributes are name:value pairs
associated with inodes (files, directories, symlinks, etc).
They are extensions to the normal attributes which are
associated with all inodes in the system (i.e. the stat(2)
data). A complete overview of extended attributes concepts
can be found in attr(5).</p>

<p>listxattr retrieves the list of extended attribute names
associated with the given path in the filesystem. The list
is the set of (NULL- terminated) names, one after the other.
Names of extended attributes to which the calling process
does not have access may be omitted from the list. The
length of the attribute name list is returned.</p>

<p>llistxattr is identical to listxattr, except in the case
of a symbolic link, where the list of names of extended
attributes associated with the link itself is retrieved, not
the file that it refers to. list is a caller-allocated
buffer of size size.</p>

<p>flistxattr is identical to listxattr, only the open file
pointed to by filedes (as returned by open(2)) is
interrogated in place of path.</p>

<p>A single extended attribute name is a simple
NULL-terminated string. The name includes a namespace prefix
- there may be several, disjoint namespaces associated with
an individual inode.</p>

<p>An empty buffer of size zero can be passed into these
calls to return the current size of the list of extended
attribute names, which can be used to estimate the size of a
buffer which is sufficiently large to hold the list of
names.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES The list of names is returned as an unordered
array of NULL-terminated character strings (attribute names
are separated by NULL characters), like this: user.name1
system.name1 user.name2</p>

<p>Filesystems like ext2, ext3 and XFS which implement
POSIX ACLs using extended attributes, might return a list
like this: system.posix_acl_access
system.posix_acl_default</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, a positive number is returned
indicating the size of the extended attribute name list. On
failure, -1 is returned and errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>If the size of the list buffer is too small to hold the
result, errno is set to ERANGE.</p>

<p>If extended attributes are not supported by the
filesystem, or are dis- abled, errno is set to ENOTSUP.</p>

<p>The errors documented for the stat(2) system call are
also applicable here.</p>
