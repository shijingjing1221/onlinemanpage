<p>ISC-HMAC-FIXUP(1) BIND9 ISC-HMAC-FIXUP(1)</p>

<p>NAME isc-hmac-fixup - fixes HMAC keys generated by older
versions of BIND</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS isc-hmac-fixup {algorithm} {secret}</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Versions of BIND 9 up to and including BIND
9.6 had a bug causing HMAC-SHA* TSIG keys which were longer
than the digest length of the hash algorithm (i.e., SHA1
keys longer than 160 bits, SHA256 keys longer than 256 bits,
etc) to be used incorrectly, generating a message
authentication code that was incompatible with other DNS
implementations.</p>

<p>This bug has been fixed in BIND 9.7. However, the fix
may cause incompatibility between older and newer versions
of BIND, when using long keys. isc-hmac-fixup modifies those
keys to restore compatibility.</p>

<p>To modify a key, run isc-hmac-fixup and specify the keys
algorithm and secret on the command line. If the secret is
longer than the digest length of the algorithm (64 bytes for
SHA1 through SHA256, or 128 bytes for SHA384 and SHA512),
then a new secret will be generated consisting of a hash
digest of the old secret. (If the secret did not require
conversion, then it will be printed without
modification.)</p>

<p>SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS Secrets that have been converted
by isc-hmac-fixup are shortened, but as this is how the HMAC
protocol works in operation anyway, it does not affect
security. RFC 2104 notes, &quot;Keys longer than [the digest
length] are acceptable but the extra length would not
significantly increase the function strength.&quot;</p>

2104.</p>
