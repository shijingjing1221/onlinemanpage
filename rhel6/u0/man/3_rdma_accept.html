<p>RDMA_ACCEPT(3) Librdmacm Programmer s Manual
RDMA_ACCEPT(3)</p>

<p>NAME rdma_accept - Called to accept a connection
request.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;rdma/rdma_cma.h&gt;</p>

<p>int rdma_accept (struct rdma_cm_id *id, struct
rdma_conn_param *conn_param);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS id Connection identifier associated with the
request.</p>

<p>conn_param Information needed to establish the
connection. See CON- NECTION PROPERTIES below for
details.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Called from the listening side to accept a
connection or datagram ser- vice lookup request.</p>

<p>NOTES Unlike the socket accept routine, rdma_accept is
not called on a lis- tening rdma_cm_id. Instead, after
calling rdma_listen, the user waits for an
RDMA_CM_EVENT_CONNECT_REQUEST event to occur. Connection
request events give the user a newly created rdma_cm_id,
similar to a new socket, but the rdma_cm_id is bound to a
specific RDMA device. rdma_accept is called on the new
rdma_cm_id.</p>

<p>CONNECTION PROPERTIES The following properties are used
to configure the communication and specified by the
conn_param parameter when accepting a connection or datagram
communication request. Users should use the rdma_conn_param
values reported in the connection request event to determine
appropri- ate values for these fields when accepting. Users
may reference the rdma_conn_param structure in the
connection event directly, or can ref- erence their own
structure. If the rdma_conn_param structure from an event is
referenced, the event must not be acked until after this
call returns.</p>

<p>private_data References a user-controlled data buffer.
The contents of the buffer are copied and transparently
passed to the remote side as part of the communication
request. May be NULL if private_data is not required.</p>

<p>private_data_len Specifies the size of the
user-controlled data buffer. Note that the actual amount of
data transferred to the remote side is transport dependent
and may be larger than that requested.</p>

<p>responder_resources The maximum number of outstanding
RDMA read and atomic opera- tions that the local side will
accept from the remote side. Applies only to RDMA_PS_TCP.
This value must be less than or equal to the local RDMA
device attribute max_qp_rd_atom and the responder_resources
value reported in the connect request event.</p>

<p>initiator_depth The maximum number of outstanding RDMA
read and atomic opera- tions that the local side will have
to the remote side. Applies only to RDMA_PS_TCP. This value
must be less than or equal to the local RDMA device
attribute max_qp_init_rd_atom and the ini- tiator_depth
value reported in the connect request event.</p>

<p>flow_control Specifies if hardware flow control is
available. This value is exchanged with the remote peer and
is not used to configure the QP. Applies only to
RDMA_PS_TCP.</p>

<p>retry_count This value is ignored.</p>

<p>rnr_retry_count The maximum number of times that a send
operation from the remote peer should be retried on a
connection after receiving a receiver not ready (RNR) error.
RNR errors are generated when a send request arrives before
a buffer has been posted to receive the incoming data.
Applies only to RDMA_PS_TCP.</p>

<p>srq Specifies if the QP associated with the connection
is using a shared receive queue. This field is ignored by
the library if a QP has been created on the rdma_cm_id.
Applies only to RDMA_PS_TCP.</p>

<p>qp_num Specifies the QP number associated with the
connection. This field is ignored by the library if a QP has
been created on the rdma_cm_id.</p>

<p>INFINIBAND SPECIFIC In addition to the connection
properties defined above, InfiniBand QPs are configured with
minimum RNR NAK timer and local ACK timeout values. The
minimum RNR NAK timer value is set to 0, for a delay of 655
ms. The local ACK timeout is calculated based on the packet
lifetime and local HCA ACK delay. The packet lifetime is
determined by the Infini- Band Subnet Administrator and is
part of the route (path record) infor- mation obtained by
the active side of the connection. The HCA ACK delay is a
property of the locally used HCA.</p>

<p>The RNR retry count is a 3-bit value.</p>
