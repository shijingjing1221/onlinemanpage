<p>Standard Channels(3) Tcl Library Procedures Standard

<p>NAME Tcl_StandardChannels - How the Tcl library deals
with the standard channels
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This page explains the initialization and
use of standard channels in the Tcl library.</p>

<p>The term standard channels comes out of the Unix world
and refers to the three channels automatically opened by the
OS for each new applica- tion. They are stdin, stdout and
stderr. The first is the standard input an application can
read from, the other two refer to writable channels, one for
regular output and the other for error messages.</p>

<p>Tcl generalizes this concept in a cross-platform way and
exposes stan- dard channels to the script level.</p>

<p>APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACES The public API
procedures dealing directly with standard channels are
Tcl_GetStdChannel and Tcl_SetStdChannel. Additional public
APIs to con- sider are Tcl_RegisterChannel,
Tcl_CreateChannel and Tcl_GetChannel.</p>

<p>INITIALIZATION OF TCL STANDARD CHANNELS Standard
channels are initialized by the Tcl library in three cases:
when explicitly requested, when implicitly required before
returning channel information, or when implicitly required
during registration of a new channel.</p>

<p>These cases differ in how they handle unavailable
platform- specific standard channels. (A channel is not
available if it could not be successfully opened; for
example, in a Tcl application run as a Windows NT
service.)</p>

<p>1) A single standard channel is initialized when it is
explicitly specified in a call to Tcl_SetStdChannel. The
states of the other standard channels are unaffected.</p>

<p>Missing platform-specific standard channels do not
matter here. This approach is not available at the script
level.</p>

<p>2) All uninitialized standard channels are initialized
to platform- specific default values:</p>

<p>(a) when open channels are listed with
Tcl_GetChannelNames (or the file channels script command),
or</p>

<p>(b) when information about any standard channel is
requested with a call to Tcl_GetStdChannel, or with a call
to Tcl_GetChannel which specifies one of the standard names
(stdin, stdout and stderr).</p>

<p>In case of missing platform-specific standard channels,
the Tcl standard channels are considered as initialized and
then immedi- ately closed. This means that the first three
Tcl channels then opened by the application are designated
as the Tcl standard channels.</p>

<p>3) All uninitialized standard channels are initialized
to platform- specific default values when a user-requested
channel is registered with Tcl_RegisterChannel.</p>

<p>In case of unavailable platform-specific standard
channels the channel whose creation caused the
initialization of the Tcl standard channels is made a normal
channel. The next three Tcl channels opened by the
application are designated as the Tcl standard channels. In
other words, of the first four Tcl channels opened by the
application the second to fourth are designated as the Tcl
standard channels.</p>

<p>RE-INITIALIZATION OF TCL STANDARD CHANNELS Once a Tcl
standard channel is initialized through one of the methods
above, closing this Tcl standard channel will cause the next
call to Tcl_CreateChannel to make the new channel the new
standard channel, too. If more than one Tcl standard channel
was closed Tcl_CreateChannel will fill the empty slots in
the order stdin, stdout and stderr.</p>

<p>Tcl_CreateChannel will not try to reinitialize an empty
slot if that slot was not initialized before. It is this
behavior which enables an application to employ method 1 of
initialization, i.e. to create and designate their own Tcl
standard channels.</p>

<p>SHELL-SPECIFIC DETAILS tclsh The Tcl shell (or rather
the function Tcl_Main, which forms the core of the shells
implementation) uses method 2 to initialize the standard
channels.</p>

<p>wish The windowing shell (or rather the function
Tk_MainEx, which forms the core of the shells
implementation) uses method 1 to initialize the standard
channels (See Tk_InitConsoleChannels) on non-Unix platforms.
On Unix platforms, Tk_MainEx implicitly uses method 2 to
initialize the standard channels.</p>
