<p>NAME clusterdb - cluster a PostgreSQL database</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS clusterdb [ connection-option... ] [ [
--verbose ] [ -v ] ] [ --table | -t table ] [ dbname ]</p>

<p>clusterdb [ connection-option... ] [ [ --all ] [ -a ] ]
[ [ --verbose ] [ -v ] ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION clusterdb is a utility for reclustering
tables in a PostgreSQL database. It finds tables that have
previously been clustered, and clusters them again on the
same index that was last used. Tables that have never been
clustered are not affected.</p>

<p>clusterdb is a wrapper around the SQL command CLUSTER
[cluster(7)]. There is no effective difference between
clustering databases via this utility and via other methods
for accessing the server.</p>

<p>OPTIONS clusterdb accepts the following command-line
arguments:</p>

<p>-a</p>

<p>--all Cluster all databases.</p>

<p>[-d] dbname</p>

<p>[--dbname] dbname Specifies the name of the database to
be clustered. If this is not specified and -a (or --all) is
not used, the database name is read from the environment
variable PGDATABASE. If that is not set, the user name
specified for the connection is used.</p>

<p>-e</p>

<p>--echo Echo the commands that clusterdb generates and
sends to the server.</p>

<p>-q</p>

<p>--quiet Do not display progress messages.</p>

<p>-t table</p>

<p>--table table Cluster table only.</p>

<p>-v</p>

<p>--verbose Print detailed information during
processing.</p>

<p>clusterdb also accepts the following command-line
arguments for connec- tion parameters:</p>

<p>-h host</p>

<p>--host host Specifies the host name of the machine on
which the server is running. If the value begins with a
slash, it is used as the directory for the Unix domain
socket.</p>

<p>-p port</p>

<p>--port port Specifies the TCP port or local Unix domain
socket file exten- sion on which the server is listening for
connections.</p>

<p>-U username</p>

<p>--username username User name to connect as.</p>

<p>-w</p>

<p>--no-password Never issue a password prompt. If the
server requires password authentication and a password is
not available by other means such as a .pgpass file, the
connection attempt will fail. This option can be useful in
batch jobs and scripts where no user is present to enter a
password.</p>

<p>-W</p>

<p>--password Force clusterdb to prompt for a password
before connecting to a database.</p>

<p>This option is never essential, since clusterdb will
automati- cally prompt for a password if the server demands
password authentication. However, clusterdb will waste a
connection attempt finding out that the server wants a
password. In some cases it is worth typing -W to avoid the
extra connection attempt.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT PGDATABASE</p>

<p>PGHOST</p>

<p>PGPORT</p>

<p>PGUSER Default connection parameters</p>

<p>This utility, like most other PostgreSQL utilities, also
uses the envi- ronment variables supported by libpq (see in
the documentation).</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS In case of difficulty, see CLUSTER
[cluster(7)] and psql(1) for discus- sions of potential
problems and error messages. The database server must be
running at the targeted host. Also, any default connection
set- tings and environment variables used by the libpq
front-end library will apply.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES To cluster the database test:</p>

<p>$ clusterdb test</p>

<p>To cluster a single table foo in a database named
xyzzy:</p>

<p>$ clusterdb --table foo xyzzy</p>

<p>SEE ALSO CLUSTER [cluster(7)]</p>
