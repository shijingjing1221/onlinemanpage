<p>ROTATELOGS(8) rotatelogs ROTATELOGS(8)</p>

<p>NAME rotatelogs - Piped logging program to rotate Apache
logs</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rotatelogs [ -l ] [ -f ] logfile
rotationtime|filesizeM [ offset ]</p>

<p>SUMMARY rotatelogs is a simple program for use in
conjunction with Apaches piped logfile feature. It supports
rotation based on a time interval or maximum size of the
log.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -l Causes the use of local time rather than GMT
as the base for the interval or for strftime(3) formatting
with size-based rotation. Note that using -l in an
environment which changes the GMT off- set (such as for BST
or DST) can lead to unpredictable results!</p>

<p>-f Causes the logfile to be opened immediately, as soon
as rotatel- ogs starts, instead of waiting for the first
logfile entry to be read (for non-busy sites, there may be a
substantial delay between when the server is started and
when the first request is handled, meaning that the
associated logfile does not &quot;exist&quot; until then,
which causes problems from some automated logging tools).
Available in version 2.2.9 and later.</p>

<p>logfile The path plus basename of the logfile. If
logfile includes any % characters, it is treated as a format
string for strf- time(3). Otherwise, the suffix .nnnnnnnnnn
is automatically added and is the time in seconds. Both
formats compute the start time from the beginning of the
current period. For example, if a rotation time of 86400 is
specified, the hour, minute, and sec- ond fields created
from the strftime(3) format will all be zero, referring to
the beginning of the current 24-hour period (mid-
night).</p>

<p>rotationtime The time between log file rotations in
seconds. The rotation occurs at the beginning of this
interval. For example, if the rotation time is 3600, the log
file will be rotated at the beginning of every hour; if the
rotation time is 86400, the log file will be rotated every
night at midnight. (If no data is logged during an interval,
no file will be created.)</p>

<p>filesizeM The maximum file size in megabytes followed by
the letter M to specify size rather than time.</p>

<p>offset The number of minutes offset from UTC. If
omitted, zero is assumed and UTC is used. For example, to
use local time in the zone UTC -5 hours, specify a value of
-300 for this argument. In most cases, -l should be used
instead of specifying an offset.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES CustomLog &quot;|bin/rotatelogs
/var/logs/logfile 86400&quot; common</p>

<p>This creates the files /var/logs/logfile.nnnn where nnnn
is the system time at which the log nominally starts (this
time will always be a mul- tiple of the rotation time, so
you can synchronize cron scripts with it). At the end of
each rotation time (here after 24 hours) a new log is
started.</p>

<p>CustomLog &quot;|bin/rotatelogs -l
/var/logs/logfile.%Y.%m.%d 86400&quot; common</p>

<p>This creates the files /var/logs/logfile.yyyy.mm.dd
where yyyy is the year, mm is the month, and dd is the day
of the month. Logging will switch to a new file every day at
midnight, local time.</p>

<p>CustomLog &quot;|bin/rotatelogs /var/logs/logfile
5M&quot; common</p>

<p>This configuration will rotate the logfile whenever it
reaches a size of 5 megabytes.</p>

<p>ErrorLog &quot;|bin/rotatelogs
/var/logs/errorlog.%Y-%m-%d-%H_%M_%S 5M&quot;</p>

<p>This configuration will rotate the error logfile
whenever it reaches a size of 5 megabytes, and the suffix to
the logfile name will be created of the form
errorlog.YYYY-mm-dd-HH_MM_SS.</p>

<p>PORTABILITY The following logfile format string
substitutions should be supported by all strftime(3)
implementations, see the strftime(3) man page for
library-specific extensions.</p>

<p>&middot; %A - full weekday name (localized)</p>

<p>&middot; %a - 3-character weekday name (localized)</p>

<p>&middot; %B - full month name (localized)</p>

<p>&middot; %b - 3-character month name (localized)</p>

<p>&middot; %c - date and time (localized)</p>

<p>&middot; %d - 2-digit day of month</p>

<p>&middot; %H - 2-digit hour (24 hour clock)</p>

<p>&middot; %I - 2-digit hour (12 hour clock)</p>

<p>&middot; %j - 3-digit day of year</p>

<p>&middot; %M - 2-digit minute</p>

<p>&middot; %m - 2-digit month</p>

<p>&middot; %p - am/pm of 12 hour clock (localized)</p>

<p>&middot; %S - 2-digit second</p>

<p>&middot; %U - 2-digit week of year (Sunday first day of
week)</p>

<p>&middot; %W - 2-digit week of year (Monday first day of
week)</p>

<p>&middot; %w - 1-digit weekday (Sunday first day of
week)</p>

<p>&middot; %X - time (localized)</p>

<p>&middot; %x - date (localized)</p>

<p>&middot; %Y - 4-digit year</p>

<p>&middot; %y - 2-digit year</p>

<p>&middot; %Z - time zone name</p>

<p>&middot; %% - literal %</p>
