<p>[xvminipic]</p>

<p>HISTORY A program of this name was written in 1993 by
Ingo Wilken and was part of Netpbm until Release 10.34
(April 2006). At that time, it was replaced in Netpbm by the
current program, which was written by Bryan Henderson. The
function of the newer program is identical to that of the
older one; the reason for the replacement is that the newer
one is easier to maintain.</p>
