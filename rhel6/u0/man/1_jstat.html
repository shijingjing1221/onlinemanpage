<p>NAME jstat - Java Virtual Machine Statistics Monitoring
Tool</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS jstat [ generalOption | outputOptionsvmid
[interval[s|ms] [count]] ]</p>

<p>PARAMETERS generalOption A single general command-line
option (-help, -options, or -version)</p>

<p>outputOptions One or more output options, consisting of
a single statOption, plus any of the -t, -h, and -J
options.</p>

<p>vmid Virtual machine identifier, a string indicating the
target Java vir- tual machine (JVM). The general syntax
is</p>

<p>[protocol:][//]lvmid[@hostname[:port]/servername] The
syntax of the vmid string largely corresponds to the syntax
of a URI. The vmid can vary from a simple integer
representing a local JVM to a more complex construction
specifying a communications pro- tocol, port number, and
other implementation-specific values. See Virtual Machine
Identifier for details.</p>

<p>interval[s|ms] Sampling interval in the specified units,
seconds (s) or millisec- onds (ms). Default units are
milliseconds. Must be a positive inte- ger. If specified,
jstat will produce its output at each interval.</p>

<p>count Number of samples to display. Default value is
infinity; that is, jstat displays statistics until the
target JVM terminates or the jstat command is terminated.
Must be a positive integer.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The jstat tool displays performance
statistics for an instrumented HotSpot Java virtual machine
(JVM). The target JVM is identified by its virtual machine
identifier, or vmid option described below.</p>

<p>NOTE: This utility is unsupported and may not be
available in future versions of the JDK. It is not currently
available on Windows 98 and Windows ME. platforms.</p>

<p>VIRTUAL MACHINE IDENTIFIER The syntax of the vmid string
largely corresponds to the syntax of a URI:</p>

<p>[protocol:][//]lvmid[@hostname][:port][/servername]</p>

<p>protocol The communications protocol. If the protocol is
omitted and a host- name is not specified, the default
protocol is a platform specific optimized local protocol. If
the protocol is omitted and a hostname is specified, then
the default protocol is rmi.</p>

<p>lvmid The local virtual machine identifier for the
target JVM. The lvmid is a platform-specific value that
uniquely identifies a JVM on a system. The lvmid is the only
required component of a virtual machine identifier. The
lvmid is typically, but not necessarily, the operating
system s process identifier for the target JVM process. You
can use the jps command to determine the lvmid. Also, you
can determine lvmid on Unix platforms with the ps command,
and on Win- dows with the Windows Task Manager.</p>

<p>hostname A hostname or IP address indicating the target
host. If hostname is omitted, then the target host is the
local host.</p>

<p>port The default port for communicating with the remote
server. If the hostname is omitted or the protocol specifies
an optimized, local protocol, then port is ignored.
Otherwise, treatment of the port parameter is implementation
specific. For the default rmi protocol, the port indicates
the port number for the rmiregistry on the remote host. If
port is omitted, and protocol indicates rmi, then the
default rmiregistry port (1099) is used.</p>

<p>servername The treatment of this parameter depends on
implementation. For the optimized local protocol, this field
is ignored. For the rmi proto- col, it represents the name
of the RMI remote object on the remote host.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The jstat command supports two types of options,
general options and output options. General options cause
jstat to display simple usage and version information.
Output options determine the content and format of the
statistical output.</p>

<p>NOTE: All options, and their functionality are subject
to change or removal in future releases.</p>

<p>GENERAL OPTIONS</p>

<p>If you specify one of the general options, you cannot
specify any other option or parameter.</p>

<p>-help Display help message.</p>

<p>-version Display version information.</p>

<p>-options Display list of statistics options. See the
Output Options section below.</p>

<p>OUTPUT OPTIONS</p>

<p>If you do not specify a general option, then you can
specify output options. Output options determine the content
and format of jstats output, and consist of a single
statOption, plus any of the other out- put options (-h, -t,
and -J). The statOption must come first.</p>

<p>Output is formatted as a table, with columns are
separated by spaces. A header row with titles describes the
columns. Use the -h option to set the frequency at which the
header is displayed. Column header names are generally
consistent between the different options. In general, if two
options provide a column with the same name, then the data
source for the two columns are the same.</p>

<p>Use the -t option to display a time stamp column,
labeled Timestamp as the first column of output. The
Timestamp column contains the elapsed time, in seconds,
since startup of the target JVM. The resolution of the time
stamp is dependent on various factors and is subject to
varia- tion due to delayed thread scheduling on heavily
loaded systems.</p>

<p>Use the interval and count parameters to determine how
frequently and how many times, respectively, jstat displays
its output.</p>

<p>NOTE: You are advised not to write scripts to parse
jstas output since the format may change in future releases.
If you choose to write scripts that parse jstat output,
expect to modify them for future releases of this tool.</p>

<p>-statOption Determines the statistics information that
jstat displays. The fol- lowing table lists the available
options. Use the -options general option to display the list
of options for a particular platform installation.</p>

<p>-hn Display a column header every n samples (output
rows), where n is a positive integer. Default value is 0,
which displays the column header above the first row of
data.</p>

<p>-tn Display a timestamp column as the first column of
output. The times- tamp is the the time since the start time
of the target JVM.</p>

<p>-JjavaOption Pass javaOption to the java application
launcher. For example, -J-Xms48m sets the startup memory to
48 megabytes. For a complete list of options, see the
following documents:</p>

<p>STATOPTIONS AND OUTPUT</p>

<p>The following tables summarize the columns that jstat
outputs for each statOption.</p>

<p>-class Option -compiler Option</p>

<p>-gc Option -gccapacity Option -gccause Option</p>

<p>This option displays the same summary of garbage
collection statistics as the -gcutil option, but includes
the causes of the last garbage col- lection event and (if
applicable) the current garbage collection event. In
addition to the columns listed for -gcutil, this option adds
the following columns:</p>

<p>-gcnew Option -gcnewcapacity Option -gcold Option
-gcoldcapacity Option -gcpermcapacity Option -gcutil
Option</p>

<p>-printcompilation Option</p>

<p>This section presents some examples of monitoring a
local JVM with a lvmid of 21891.</p>

<p>Using the gcutil option This example attaches to lvmid
21891 and takes 7 samples at 250 mil- lisecond intervals and
displays the output as specified by the -gcutil option.
jstat -gcutil 21891 250 7</p>

<p>0.00 7.74 58.11 9.51 96.71 79 0.177 5 0.495 0.673</p>

<p>The output of this example shows that a young generation
collection occurred between the 3rd and 4th sample. The
collection took 0.001 sec- onds and promoted objects from
the eden space (E) to the old space (O), resulting in an
increase of old space utilization from 9.49% to 9.51%.
Before the collection, the survivor space was 12.44%
utilized, but after this collection it is only 7.74%
utilized.</p>

<p>Repeating the column header string</p>

<p>This example attaches to lvmid 21891 and takes samples
at 250 millisec- ond intervals and displays the output as
specified by -gcutil option. In addition, it uses the -h3
option to output the column header after every 3 lines of
data. jstat -gcnew -h3 21891 250</p>

<p>In addition to showing the repeating header string, this
example shows that between the 2nd and 3rd samples, a young
GC occurred. Its duration was 0.001 seconds. The collection
found enough live data that the sur- vivor space 0
utilization (S0U) would would have exceeded the desired
survivor Size (DSS). As a result, objects were promoted to
the old gen- eration (not visible in this output), and the
tenuring threshold (TT) was lowered from 31 to 2.</p>

<p>Another collection occurs between the 5th and 6th
samples. This collec- tion found very few survivors and
returned the tenuring threshold to 31.</p>

<p>Including a time stamp for each sample</p>

<p>This example attaches to lvmid 21891 and takes 3 samples
at 250 mil- lisecond intervals. The -t option is used to
generate a time stamp for each sample in the first column.
jstat -gcoldcapacity -t 21891 250 3</p>

<p>Timestamp OGCMN OGCMX OGC OC YGC FGC FGCT GCT</p>

<p>150.1 1408.0 60544.0 11696.0 11696.0 194 80 2.874

<p>150.4 1408.0 60544.0 13820.0 13820.0 194 81 2.938

<p>150.7 1408.0 60544.0 13820.0 13820.0 194 81 2.938
3.863</p>

<p>The Timestamp column reports the elapsed time in seconds
since the start of the target JVM. In addition, the
-gcoldcapacity output shows the old generation capacity
(OGC) and the old space capacity (OC) increasing as the heap
expands to meet allocation and/or promotion demands. The old
generation capacity (OGC) has grown to from 11696 KB to
13820 KB after the 81st Full GC (FGC). The maximum capacity
of the generation (and space) is 60544 KB (OGCMX), so it
still has room to expand.</p>

<p>Monitor instrumentation for a remote JVM</p>

<p>This example attaches to lvmid 40496 on the system named
remote.domain using the -gcutil option, with samples taken
every second indefinitely. jstat -gcutil 40496@remote.domain
1000</p>

<p>The lvmid is combined with the name of the remote host
to construct a vmid of 40496@remote.domain. This vmid
results in the use of the rmi protocol to communicate to the
default jstatd server on the remote host. The jstatd server
is located using the rmiregistry on remote.domain that is
bound to the default rmiregistry port (port 1099).</p>
