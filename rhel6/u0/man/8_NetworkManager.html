<p>NAME NetworkManager - network management daemon</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS NetworkManager [--no-daemon]
[--pid-file=&lt;filename&gt;]
[--state-file=&lt;filename&gt;] [--config=&lt;filename&gt;]
[--plugins=&lt;plu- gin1&gt;,plugin2&gt;,...]
[--log-level=&lt;level&gt;]
[--log-domains=&lt;domain1&gt;,&lt;domain2&gt;,...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The NetworkManager daemon attempts to make
networking configuration and operation as painless and
automatic as possible by managing the primary network
connection and other network interfaces, like Ethernet,
WiFi, and Mobile Broadband devices. NetworkManager will
connect any network device when a connection for that device
becomes available, unless that behavior is disabled.
Information about networking is exported via a D-Bus
interface to any interested application, providing a rich
API with which to inspect and control network settings and
oper- ation.</p>

<p>NetworkManager will execute scripts in the
/etc/NetworkManager/dis- patcher.d directory in alphabetical
order in response to network events. Each script should be
(a) a regular file, (b) owned by root, (c) not writable by
group or other, (d) not set-uid, (e) and executable by the
owner. Each script receives two arguments, the first being
the interface name of the device just activated, and second
an action.</p>

<p>up The interface has been activated. The environment
contains more information about the interface;
CONNECTION_UUID contains the UUID of the connection. Other
variables are IP4_ADDRESS_N where N is a number from 0 to (#
IPv4 addresses - 1), in the format &quot;address/prefix
gateway&quot;. IP4_NUM_ADDRESSES contains the number
addresses the script may expect. IP4_NAMESERVERS contains a
space-separated list of the DNS servers, and IP4_DOMAINS
con- tains a space-separated list of the search domains.
Routes use the format IP4_ROUTE_N where N is a number from 0
to (# IPv4 routes - 1), in the format &quot;address/prefix
next-hop metric&quot;, and IP4_NUM_ROUTES contains the
number of routes to expect. If the connection used DHCP for
address configuration, the received DHCP configuration is
passed in the environment using standard DHCP option names,
prefixed with &quot;DHCP4_&quot;, like
&quot;DHCP4_HOST_NAME=foobar&quot;.</p>

<p>down The interface has been deactivated.</p>

<p>vpn-up A VPN connection has been activated. The
environment contains the connection UUID in the variable
CONNECTION_UUID.</p>

<p>vpn-down A VPN connection has been deactivated.</p>

<p>hostname The system hostname has been updated. Use
gethostname(2) to retrieve it.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The following options are supported:</p>

<p>--no-daemon Do not daemonize. This is useful for
debugging, and directs log output to the controlling
terminal in addition to syslog.</p>

<p>--pid-file=&lt;filename&gt; Specify location of a PID
file. The PID file is used for stor- ing PID of the running
proccess and prevents running multiple instances.</p>

<p>--state-file=&lt;filename&gt; Specify file for storing
state of the NetworkManager persis- tently. If not
specified, the default value of &lt;LOCALSTATE-
DIR&gt;/lib/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.state is used;
where &lt;LOCALSTATEDIR&gt; is dependent on your
distribution (usually its /var).</p>

<p>--config=&lt;filename&gt; Specify configuration file to
set up various settings for Net- workManager. If not
specified, the default value of
&lt;SYSCONFDIR&gt;/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf is
used with a fallback to the older nm-system-settings.conf if
located in the same directory; where &lt;SYSCONFDIR&gt; is
dependent on your dis- tribution (usually it s /etc). See
NetworkManager.conf(5) for more information on configuration
file.</p>

<p>--plugins=&lt;plugin1&gt;,&lt;plugin2&gt;, ... List
plugins used to manage system-wide connection settings. This
list has preference over plugins specified in the configu-
ration file. Currently supported plugins are: keyfile,
ifcfg-rh, ifcfg-suse, ifupdown. See NetworkManager.conf(5)
for more information on the plugins.</p>

<p>--log-level=&lt;level&gt; Sets how much information
NetworkManager sends to the log desti- nation (usually
syslogs &quot;daemon&quot; facility). By default, only
informational, warning, and error messages are logged. See
Net- workManager.conf(5) for more information on log levels
and domains.</p>

<p>--log-domains=&lt;domain1&gt;,&lt;domain2&gt;, ... Sets
which operations are logged to the log destination (usually
syslog). By default, most domains are logging-enabled. See
NetworkManager.conf(5) for more information on log levels
and domains.</p>

<p>DEBUGGING The following environment variables are
supported to help debugging. When used in conjunction with
the &quot;--no-daemon&quot; option (thus echoing PPP and
DHCP helper output to stdout) these can quickly help
pinpoint the source of connection issues. Also see the
--log-level and --log-domains to enable debug logging inside
NetworkManager itself.</p>

<p>NM_PPP_DEBUG When set to anything, causes NetworkManager
to turn on PPP debugging in pppd, which logs all PPP and
PPTP frames and client/server exchanges.</p>
