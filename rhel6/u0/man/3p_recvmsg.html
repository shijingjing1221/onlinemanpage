<p>RECVMSG(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual RECVMSG(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME recvmsg - receive a message from a socket</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;</p>

<p>ssize_t recvmsg(int socket, struct msghdr *message, int
flags);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The recvmsg() function shall receive a
message from a connection-mode or connectionless-mode
socket. It is normally used with connectionless- mode
sockets because it permits the application to retrieve the
source address of received data.</p>

<p>The recvmsg() function takes the following
arguments:</p>

<p>socket Specifies the socket file descriptor.</p>

<p>message Points to a msghdr structure, containing both
the buffer to store the source address and the buffers for
the incoming mes- sage. The length and format of the address
depend on the address family of the socket. The msg_flags
member is ignored on input, but may contain meaningful
values on output.</p>

<p>flags Specifies the type of message reception. Values of
this argument are formed by logically ORing zero or more of
the following values:</p>

<p>MSG_OOB Requests out-of-band data. The significance and
semantics of out-of-band data are protocol-specific.</p>

<p>MSG_PEEK Peeks at the incoming message.</p>

<p>MSG_WAITALL On SOCK_STREAM sockets this requests that
the function block until the full amount of data can be
returned. The function may return the smaller amount of data
if the socket is a message- based socket, if a signal is
caught, if the connection is termi- nated, if MSG_PEEK was
specified, or if an error is pending for the socket.</p>

<p>The recvmsg() function shall receive messages from
unconnected or con- nected sockets and shall return the
length of the message.</p>

<p>The recvmsg() function shall return the total length of
the message. For message-based sockets, such as SOCK_DGRAM
and SOCK_SEQPACKET, the entire message shall be read in a
single operation. If a message is too long to fit in the
supplied buffers, and MSG_PEEK is not set in the flags
argument, the excess bytes shall be discarded, and MSG_TRUNC
shall be set in the msg_flags member of the msghdr
structure. For stream-based sockets, such as SOCK_STREAM,
message boundaries shall be ignored. In this case, data
shall be returned to the user as soon as it becomes
available, and no data shall be discarded.</p>

<p>If the MSG_WAITALL flag is not set, data shall be
returned only up to the end of the first message.</p>

<p>If no messages are available at the socket and
O_NONBLOCK is not set on the sockets file descriptor,
recvmsg() shall block until a message arrives. If no
messages are available at the socket and O_NONBLOCK is set
on the sockets file descriptor, the recvmsg() function shall
fail and set errno to [EAGAIN] or [EWOULDBLOCK].</p>

<p>In the msghdr structure, the msg_name and msg_namelen
members specify the source address if the socket is
unconnected. If the socket is con- nected, the msg_name and
msg_namelen members shall be ignored. The msg_name member
may be a null pointer if no names are desired or required.
The msg_iov and msg_iovlen fields are used to specify where
the received data shall be stored. msg_iov points to an
array of iovec structures; msg_iovlen shall be set to the
dimension of this array. In each iovec structure, the
iov_base field specifies a storage area and the iov_len
field gives its size in bytes. Each storage area indicated
by msg_iov is filled with received data in turn until all of
the received data is stored or all of the areas have been
filled.</p>

<p>Upon successful completion, the msg_flags member of the
message header shall be the bitwise-inclusive OR of all of
the following flags that indicate conditions detected for
the received message:</p>

<p>MSG_EOR End-of-record was received (if supported by the
protocol).</p>

<p>MSG_OOB Out-of-band data was received.</p>

<p>MSG_TRUNC Normal data was truncated.</p>

<p>MSG_CTRUNC Control data was truncated.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, recvmsg() shall
return the length of the message in bytes. If no messages
are available to be received and the peer has performed an
orderly shutdown, recvmsg() shall return 0. Oth- erwise, -1
shall be returned and errno set to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The recvmsg() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EAGAIN or EWOULDBLOCK</p>

<p>The sockets file descriptor is marked O_NONBLOCK and no
data is waiting to be received; or MSG_OOB is set and no
out-of-band data is available and either the socket s file
descriptor is marked O_NONBLOCK or the socket does not
support blocking to await out-of-band data.</p>

<p>EBADF The socket argument is not a valid open file
descriptor.</p>

<p>ECONNRESET A connection was forcibly closed by a
peer.</p>

<p>EINTR This function was interrupted by a signal before
any data was available.</p>

<p>EINVAL The sum of the iov_len values overflows a
ssize_t, or the MSG_OOB flag is set and no out-of-band data
is available.</p>

<p>EMSGSIZE The msg_iovlen member of the msghdr structure
pointed to by mes- sage is less than or equal to 0, or is
greater than {IOV_MAX}.</p>

<p>ENOTCONN A receive is attempted on a connection-mode
socket that is not connected.</p>

<p>ENOTSOCK The socket argument does not refer to a
socket.</p>

<p>EOPNOTSUPP The specified flags are not supported for
this socket type.</p>

<p>ETIMEDOUT The connection timed out during connection
establishment, or due to a transmission timeout on active
connection.</p>

<p>The recvmsg() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EIO An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing
to the file system.</p>

<p>ENOBUFS Insufficient resources were available in the
system to perform the operation.</p>

<p>ENOMEM Insufficient memory was available to fulfill the
request.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The select() and poll() functions can
be used to determine when data is available to be
received.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
