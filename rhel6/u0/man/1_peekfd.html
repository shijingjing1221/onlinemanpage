<p>NAME peekfd - peek at file descriptors of running
processes</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS peekfd [-8,--eight-bit-clean] [-n,--no-headers]
[-f,--follow] [-d,--duplicates-removed] [-V,--version]
[-h,--help] pid [fd] [fd] ...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION peekfd attaches to a running process and
intercepts all reads and writes to file descriptors. You can
specify the desired file descrip- tor numbers or dump all of
them.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -8 Do no post-processing on the bytes being read
or written.</p>

<p>-n Do not display headers indicating the source of the
bytes dumped.</p>

<p>-c Also dump the requested file descriptor activity in
any new child processes that are created.</p>

<p>-d Remove duplicate read/writes from the output. If
youre looking at a tty with echo, you might want this.</p>

<p>-v Display a version string.</p>

<p>-h Display a help message.</p>

<p>FILES /proc/*/fd Not used but useful for the user to
look at to get good file descriptor numbers.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT None.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS The following diagnostics may be issued on
stderr:</p>

<p>Error attaching to pid ... An unknown error occured
while attempted to attach to a pro- cess.. you may need to
be root.</p>

<p>BUGS Probably lots. Dont be surprised if the process you
are monitoring dies.</p>
