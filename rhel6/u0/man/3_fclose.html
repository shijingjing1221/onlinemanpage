<p>NAME fclose - close a stream</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</p>

<p>int fclose(FILE *fp);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The fclose() function will flushes the
stream pointed to by fp (writing any buffered output data
using fflush(3)) and closes the underlying file
descriptor.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion 0 is returned.
Otherwise, EOF is returned and errno is set to indicate the
error. In either case any further access (including another
call to fclose()) to the stream results in undefined
behavior.</p>

<p>ERRORS EBADF The file descriptor underlying fp is not
valid.</p>

<p>The fclose() function may also fail and set errno for
any of the errors specified for the routines close(2),
write(2) or fflush(3).</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO C89, C99.</p>

<p>NOTES Note that fclose() only flushes the user space
buffers provided by the C library. To ensure that the data
is physically stored on disk the kernel buffers must be
flushed too, for example, with sync(2) or fsync(2).</p>

<p>SEE ALSO close(2), fcloseall(3), fflush(3), fopen(3),
setbuf(3)</p>
