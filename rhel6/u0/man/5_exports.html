<p>EXPORTS(5) Linux File Formats Manual EXPORTS(5)</p>

<p>NAME exports - NFS file systems being exported (for
Kernel based NFS)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS /etc/exports</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The file /etc/exports serves as the access
control list for file sys- tems which may be exported to NFS
clients. It is used by exportfs(8) to give information to
mountd(8) and to the kernel based NFS file server daemon
nfsd(8).</p>

<p>The file format is similar to the SunOS exports file.
Each line con- tains an export point and a
whitespace-separated list of clients allowed to mount the
file system at that point. Each listed client may be
immediately followed by a parenthesized, comma-separated
list of export options for that client. No whitespace is
permitted between a client and its option list.</p>

<p>Also, each line may have one or more specifications for
default options after the path name, in the form of a dash
(&quot;-&quot;) followed by an option list. The option list
is used for all subsequent exports on that line only.</p>

<p>Blank lines are ignored. A pound sign (&quot;#&quot;)
introduces a comment to the end of the line. Entries may be
continued across newlines using a backslash. If an export
name contains spaces it should be quoted using double
quotes. You can also specify spaces or other unusual
character in the export name using a backslash followed by
the character code as three octal digits.</p>

<p>To apply changes to this file, run exportfs -ra or
restart the NFS server.</p>

<p>Machine Name Formats NFS clients may be specified in a
number of ways:</p>

<p>single host This is the most common format. You may
specify a host either by an abbreviated name recognized be
the resolver, the fully quali- fied domain name, or an IP
address.</p>

<p>netgroups NIS netgroups may be given as @group. Only the
host part of each netgroup members is consider in checking
for membership. Empty host parts or those containing a
single dash (-) are ignored.</p>

<p>wildcards Machine names may contain the wildcard
characters * and ?. This can be used to make the exports
file more compact; for instance, *.cs.foo.edu matches all
hosts in the domain cs.foo.edu. As these characters also
match the dots in a domain name, the given pattern will also
match all hosts within any subdomain of cs.foo.edu.</p>

<p>IP networks You can also export directories to all hosts
on an IP (sub-) network simultaneously. This is done by
specifying an IP address and netmask pair as address/netmask
where the netmask can be specified in dotted-decimal format,
or as a contiguous mask length (for example, either
/255.255.252.0 or /22 appended to the network base address
result in identical subnetworks with 10 bits of host).
Wildcard characters generally do not work on IP addresses,
though they may work by accident when reverse DNS lookups
fail.</p>

<p>RPCSEC_GSS security You may use the special strings
&quot;gss/krb5&quot;, &quot;gss/krb5i&quot;, or
&quot;gss/krb5p&quot; to restrict access to clients using
rpcsec_gss security. However, this syntax is deprecated; on
linux kernels since 2.6.23, you should instead use the
&quot;sec=&quot; export option:</p>

<p>sec= The sec= option, followed by a colon-delimited list
of security flavors, restricts the export to clients using
those flavors. Available security flavors include sys (the
default--no crypto- graphic security), krb5 (authentication
only), krb5i (integrity protection), and krb5p (privacy
protection). For the purposes of security flavor
negotiation, order counts: preferred flavors should be
listed first. The order of the sec= option with respect to
the other options does not matter, unless you want some
options to be enforced differently depending on flavor. In
that case you may include multiple sec= options, and
following options will be enforced only for access using
flavors listed in the immediately preceding sec= option. The
only options that are permitted to vary in this way are ro,
rw, no_root_squash, root_squash, and all_squash.</p>

<p>General Options exportfs understands the following
export options:</p>

<p>secure This option requires that requests originate on
an Internet port less than IPPORT_RESERVED (1024). This
option is on by default. To turn it off, specify
insecure.</p>

<p>rw Allow both read and write requests on this NFS
volume. The default is to disallow any request which changes
the filesystem. This can also be made explicit by using the
ro option.</p>

<p>async This option allows the NFS server to violate the
NFS protocol and reply to requests before any changes made
by that request have been committed to stable storage (e.g.
disc drive).</p>

<p>Using this option usually improves performance, but at
the cost that an unclean server restart (i.e. a crash) can
cause data to be lost or corrupted.</p>

<p>sync Reply to requests only after the changes have been
committed to stable storage (see async above).</p>

<p>In releases of nfs-utils up to and including 1.0.0, this
option was the default. In all releases after 1.0.0, sync is
the default, and async must be explicitly requested if
needed. To help make system administrators aware of this
change, exportfs will issue a warning if neither sync nor
async is specified.</p>

<p>no_wdelay This option has no effect if async is also
set. The NFS server will normally delay committing a write
request to disc slightly if it suspects that another related
write request may be in progress or may arrive soon. This
allows multiple write requests to be committed to disc with
the one operation which can improve performance. If an NFS
server received mainly small unrelated requests, this
behaviour could actually reduce performance, so no_wdelay is
available to turn it off. The default can be explicitly
requested with the wdelay option.</p>

<p>nohide This option is based on the option of the same
name provided in IRIX NFS. Normally, if a server exports two
filesystems one of which is mounted on the other, then the
client will have to mount both filesystems explicitly to get
access to them. If it just mounts the parent, it will see an
empty directory at the place where the other filesystem is
mounted. That filesystem is &quot;hidden&quot;.</p>

<p>Setting the nohide option on a filesystem causes it not
to be hidden, and an appropriately authorised client will be
able to move from the parent to that filesystem without
noticing the change.</p>

<p>However, some NFS clients do not cope well with this
situation as, for instance, it is then possible for two
files in the one apparent filesystem to have the same inode
number.</p>

<p>The nohide option is currently only effective on single
host exports. It does not work reliably with netgroup,
subnet, or wildcard exports.</p>

<p>This option can be very useful in some situations, but
it should be used with due care, and only after confirming
that the client system copes with the situation
effectively.</p>

<p>The option can be explicitly disabled with hide.</p>

<p>crossmnt This option is similar to nohide but it makes
it possible for clients to move from the filesystem marked
with crossmnt to exported filesystems mounted on it. Thus
when a child filesys- tem &quot;B&quot; is mounted on a
parent &quot;A&quot;, setting crossmnt on &quot;A&quot; has
the same effect as setting &quot;nohide&quot; on B.</p>

<p>no_subtree_check This option disables subtree checking,
which has mild security implications, but can improve
reliability in some circumstances.</p>

<p>If a subdirectory of a filesystem is exported, but the
whole filesystem isn t then whenever a NFS request arrives,
the server must check not only that the accessed file is in
the appropriate filesystem (which is easy) but also that it
is in the exported tree (which is harder). This check is
called the subtree_check.</p>

<p>In order to perform this check, the server must include
some information about the location of the file in the
&quot;filehandle&quot; that is given to the client. This can
cause problems with accessing files that are renamed while a
client has them open (though in many simple cases it will
still work).</p>

<p>subtree checking is also used to make sure that files
inside directories to which only root has access can only be
accessed if the filesystem is exported with no_root_squash
(see below), even if the file itself allows more general
access.</p>

<p>As a general guide, a home directory filesystem, which
is nor- mally exported at the root and may see lots of file
renames, should be exported with subtree checking disabled.
A filesystem which is mostly readonly, and at least doesnt
see many file renames (e.g. /usr or /var) and for which
subdirectories may be exported, should probably be exported
with subtree checks enabled.</p>

<p>The default of having subtree checks enabled, can be
explicitly requested with subtree_check.</p>

<p>From release 1.1.0 of nfs-utils onwards, the default
will be no_subtree_check as subtree_checking tends to cause
more prob- lems than it is worth. If you genuinely require
subtree check- ing, you should explicitly put that option in
the exports file. If you put neither option, exportfs will
warn you that the change is pending.</p>

<p>insecure_locks</p>

<p>no_auth_nlm This option (the two names are synonymous)
tells the NFS server not to require authentication of
locking requests (i.e. requests which use the NLM protocol).
Normally the NFS server will require a lock request to hold
a credential for a user who has read access to the file.
With this flag no access checks will be performed.</p>

<p>Early NFS client implementations did not send
credentials with lock requests, and many current NFS clients
still exist which are based on the old implementations. Use
this flag if you find that you can only lock files which are
world readable.</p>

<p>The default behaviour of requiring authentication for
NLM requests can be explicitly requested with either of the
synony- mous auth_nlm, or secure_locks.</p>

<p>no_acl On some specially patched kernels, and when
exporting filesys- tems that support ACLs, this option tells
nfsd not to reveal ACLs to clients, so they will see only a
subset of actual per- missions on the given file system.
This option is safe for filesystems used by NFSv2 clients
and old NFSv3 clients that perform access decisions locally.
Current NFSv3 clients use the ACCESS RPC to perform all
access decisions on the server. Note that the no_acl option
only has effect on kernels specially patched to support it,
and when exporting filesystems with ACL support. The default
is to export with ACL support (i.e. by default, no_acl is
off).</p>

<p>mountpoint=path</p>

<p>mp This option makes it possible to only export a
directory if it has successfully been mounted. If no path is
given (e.g. mountpoint or mp) then the export point must
also be a mount point. If it isnt then the export point is
not exported. This allows you to be sure that the directory
underneath a mountpoint will never be exported by accident
if, for example, the filesys- tem failed to mount due to a
disc error.</p>

<p>If a path is given (e.g. mountpoint=/path or mp=/path)
then the nominated path must be a mountpoint for the
exportpoint to be exported.</p>

<p>fsid=num|root|uuid NFS needs to be able to identify each
filesystem that it exports. Normally it will use a UUID for
the filesystem (if the filesystem has such a thing) or the
device number of the device holding the filesystem (if the
filesystem is stored on the device).</p>

<p>As not all filesystems are stored on devices, and not
all filesystems have UUIDs, it is sometimes necessary to
explicitly tell NFS how to identify a filesystem. This is
done with the fsid= option.</p>

<p>For NFSv4, there is a distinguished filesystem which is
the root of all exported filesystem. This is specified with
fsid=root or fsid=0 both of which mean exactly the same
thing.</p>

<p>Other filesystems can be identified with a small
integer, or a UUID which should contain 32 hex digits and
arbitrary punctua- tion.</p>

<p>Linux kernels version 2.6.20 and earlier do not
understand the UUID setting so a small integer must be used
if an fsid option needs to be set for such kernels. Setting
both a small number and a UUID is supported so the same
configuration can be made to work on old and new kernels
alike.</p>

<p>refer=path@host[+host][:path@host[+host]] A client
referencing the export point will be directed to choose from
the given list an alternative location for the filesystem.
(Note that the server must have a mountpoint here, though a
dif- ferent filesystem is not required; so, for example,
mount --bind /path /path is sufficient.)</p>

<p>replicas=path@host[+host][:path@host[+host]] If the
client asks for alternative locations for the export point,
it will be given this list of alternatives. (Note that
actual replication of the filesystem must be handled
elsewhere.)</p>

actual replication of the filesystem must be handled

<p>User ID Mapping nfsd bases its access control to files
on the server machine on the uid and gid provided in each
NFS RPC request. The normal behavior a user would expect is
that she can access her files on the server just as she
would on a normal file system. This requires that the same
uids and gids are used on the client and the server machine.
This is not always true, nor is it always desirable.</p>

<p>Very often, it is not desirable that the root user on a
client machine is also treated as root when accessing files
on the NFS server. To this end, uid 0 is normally mapped to
a different id: the so-called anony- mous or nobody uid.
This mode of operation (called root squashing) is the
default, and can be turned off with no_root_squash.</p>

<p>By default, exportfs chooses a uid and gid of 65534 for
squashed access. These values can also be overridden by the
anonuid and anongid options. Finally, you can map all user
requests to the anonymous uid by specifying the all_squash
option.</p>

<p>Heres the complete list of mapping options:</p>

<p>root_squash Map requests from uid/gid 0 to the anonymous
uid/gid. Note that this does not apply to any other uids or
gids that might be equally sensitive, such as user bin or
group staff.</p>

<p>no_root_squash Turn off root squashing. This option is
mainly useful for disk- less clients.</p>

<p>all_squash Map all uids and gids to the anonymous user.
Useful for NFS- exported public FTP directories, news spool
directories, etc. The opposite option is no_all_squash,
which is the default set- ting.</p>

<p>anonuid and anongid These options explicitly set the uid
and gid of the anonymous account. This option is primarily
useful for PC/NFS clients, where you might want all requests
appear to be from one user. As an example, consider the
export entry for /home/joe in the exam- ple section below,
which maps all requests to uid 150 (which is supposedly that
of user joe).</p>

<p>EXAMPLE # sample /etc/exports file / master(rw)
trusty(rw,no_root_squash) /projects proj*.local.domain(rw)
/usr *.local.domain(ro) @trusted(rw) /home/joe
pc001(rw,all_squash,anonuid=150,anongid=100) /pub
*(ro,insecure,all_squash) /srv/www -sync,rw server @trusted
@external(ro)</p>

<p>The first line exports the entire filesystem to machines
master and trusty. In addition to write access, all uid
squashing is turned off for host trusty. The second and
third entry show examples for wildcard hostnames and
netgroups (this is the entry @trusted). The fourth line
shows the entry for the PC/NFS client discussed above. Line
5 exports the public FTP directory to every host in the
world, executing all requests under the nobody account. The
insecure option in this entry also allows clients with NFS
implementations that don t use a reserved port for NFS. The
sixth line exports a directory read-write to the machine
server as well as the @trusted netgroup, and read-only to
netgroup @external, all three mounts with the sync option
enabled.</p>
