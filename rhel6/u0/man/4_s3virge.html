<p>NAME s3virge - S3 ViRGE video driver</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS Section &quot;Device&quot; Identifier
&quot;devname&quot; Driver &quot;s3virge&quot; ... [ Option
&quot;optionname&quot; [&quot;optionvalue&quot;]]
EndSection</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION s3virge is an Xorg driver for S3 based video
cards. The driver is fully accelerated, and provides support
for the following framebuffer depths: 8, 15, 16, and 24. All
visual types are supported for depth 8, and TrueColor
visuals are supported for the other depths. XVideo hard-
ware up scaling is supported in depth 16 and 24 on the DX,
GX, GX2, MX, MX+, and Trio3D/2X. Doublescan modes are
supported and tested in depth 8 and 16 on DX, but disable
XVideo. Doublescan modes on other chipsets are untested.</p>

<p>SUPPORTED HARDWARE The s3virge driver supports PCI and
AGP video cards based on the fol- lowing S3 chips:</p>

<p>ViRGE 86C325</p>

<p>ViRGE VX 86C988</p>

<p>ViRGE DX 86C375</p>

<p>ViRGE GX 86C385</p>

<p>ViRGE GX2 86C357</p>

<p>ViRGE MX 86C260</p>

<p>ViRGE MX+ 86C280</p>

<p>Trio 3D 86C365</p>

<p>Trio 3D/2X 86C362, 86C368</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION DETAILS Please refer to xorg.conf(5) for
general configuration details. This section only covers
configuration details specific to this driver. All options
names are case and white space insensitive when parsed by
the server, for example, &quot;virge vx&quot; and
&quot;VIRGEvx&quot; are equivalent.</p>

<p>The driver auto-detects the chipset type, but the
following ChipSet names may optionally be specified in the
config file &quot;&quot;Device&quot;&quot; sec- tion, and
will override the auto-detection:</p>

<p>&quot;virge&quot;, &quot;86c325&quot;, &quot;virge
vx&quot;, &quot;86c988&quot;, &quot;virge dx&quot;,
&quot;86c375&quot;, &quot;virge gx&quot;,
&quot;86c385&quot;, &quot;virge gx2&quot;,
&quot;86c357&quot;, &quot;virge mx&quot;,
&quot;86c260&quot;, &quot;virge mx+&quot;,
&quot;86c280&quot;, &quot;trio 3d&quot;, &quot;86c365&quot;,
&quot;trio 3d/2x&quot;, &quot;86c362&quot;,
&quot;86c368&quot;.</p>

<p>The following Cursor Options are supported:</p>

<p>Option &quot;HWCursor&quot; [&quot;boolean&quot;] Enable
or disable the HW cursor. Default: on.</p>

<p>Option &quot;SWCursor&quot; [&quot;boolean&quot;]
Inverse of &quot;HWCursor&quot;. Default: off.</p>

<p>The following display Options are supported:</p>

<p>Option &quot;ShadowFB&quot; [&quot;boolean&quot;] Use
shadow framebuffer. Disables HW acceleration. Default:
off.</p>

<p>Option &quot;Rotate&quot; &quot;cw | ccw&quot; Rotate
the screen CW - clockwise or CCW - counter clockwise.
Disables HW Acceleration and HW Cursor, uses ShadowFB.
Default: no rotation.</p>

<p>Option &quot;XVideo&quot; [&quot;boolean&quot;] Disable
XVideo support by using the off option. This changes FIFO
settings which prevent screen noise for high-res modes.
Default: on</p>

<p>The following video memory Options are supported:</p>

<p>Option &quot;slow_edodram&quot; Switch the standard
ViRGE to 2-cycle edo mode. Try this if you encounter pixel
corruption on the ViRGE. Using this option will cause a
large decrease in performance. Default: off.</p>

<p>Option &quot;fpm_vram&quot; Switch the ViRGE/VX to fast
page mode vram mode. Default: off.</p>

<p>Option &quot;slow_dram | fast_dram&quot; Change Trio 3D
and 3D/2X memory options. Default: Use BIOS defaults.</p>

<p>Option &quot;early_ras_precharge |
late_ras_precharge&quot; adjust memory parameters. One of
these will us the same set- tings as your video card
defaults, and using neither in the con- fig file does the
same. Default: none.</p>

<p>Option &quot;set_mclk&quot; &quot;integer&quot; sets the
memory clock, where integer is in kHz, and integer &lt;=
100000. Default: probe the memory clock value, and use it at
server start.</p>

<p>Option &quot;set_refclk&quot; &quot;integer&quot; sets
the ref clock for ViRGE MX, where integer is in kHz.
Default: probe the memory clock value, and use it at server
start.</p>

<p>The following acceleration and graphics engine Options
are supported:</p>

<p>Option &quot;NoAccel&quot; Disable acceleration. Very
useful for determining if the driver has problems with
drawing and acceleration routines. This is the first option
to try if your server runs but you see graphic corruption on
the screen. Using it decreases performance, as it uses
software emulation for drawing operations the video driver
can accelerate with hardware. Default: acceleration is
enabled.</p>

<p>Option &quot;UseFB&quot; There are two framebuffer
rendering methods. fb and cfb. Both are available in the
driver. fb is the newer and default method. To switch back
to cfb use this option with no, off or other negative
parameter. Default: on.</p>

<p>Option &quot;fifo_aggressive | fifo_moderate |
fifo_conservative&quot; alter the settings for the threshold
at which the pixel FIFO takes over the internal memory bus
to refill itself. The smaller this threshold, the better the
acceleration performance of the card. You may try the
fastest setting (fifo_aggressive) and move down if you
encounter pixel corruption. The optimal setting will
probably depend on dot-clock and on color depth. Note that
specifying any of these options will also alter other memory
settings which may increase performance, so trying
fifo_conser- vative will in most cases be a slight benefit
(this uses the chip defaults). If pixel corruption or
transient streaking is observed during drawing operations
then removing any fifo options is recommended. Default:
none.</p>

<p>The following PCI bus Options are supported:</p>

<p>Option &quot;pci_burst&quot; [&quot;boolean&quot;] will
enable PCI burst mode. This should work on all but a few
broken PCI chipsets, and will increase performance. Default:
off.</p>

<p>Option &quot;pci_retry&quot; [&quot;boolean&quot;] will
allow the driver to rely on PCI Retry to program the ViRGE
registers. pci_burst must be enabled for this to work. This
will increase performance, especially for small fills/blits,
because the driver does not have to poll the ViRGE before
send- ing it commands to make sure it is ready. It should
work on most recent PCI chipsets. Default: off.</p>

<p>The following ViRGE MX LCD Options are supported:</p>

<p>Option &quot;lcd_center&quot;</p>

<p>Option &quot;set_lcdclk&quot; &quot;integer&quot; allows
setting the clock for a ViRGE MX LCD display. integer is in
Hz. Default: use probed value.</p>

<p>The following additional Options are supported:</p>

<p>Option &quot;ShowCache&quot; [&quot;boolean&quot;]
Enable or disable viewing offscreen cache memory. A
development debug option. Default: off.</p>

<p>Option &quot;mx_cr3a_fix&quot; [&quot;boolean&quot;]
Enable or disable a cr3a fix added for ViRGE MX. Default:
on.</p>

<p>KNOWN BUGS The VideoRam generic driver parameter is
presently ignored by the s3virge driver. On PPC this is
reported to cause problems for 2M cards, because they may
autodetect as 4M.</p>
