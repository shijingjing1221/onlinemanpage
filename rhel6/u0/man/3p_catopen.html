<p>CATOPEN(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual CATOPEN(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME catopen - open a message catalog</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;nl_types.h&gt;</p>

<p>nl_catd catopen(const char *name, int oflag);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The catopen() function shall open a message
catalog and return a mes- sage catalog descriptor. The name
argument specifies the name of the message catalog to be
opened. If name contains a, then name speci- fies a complete
name for the message catalog. Otherwise, the environ- ment
variable NLSPATH is used with name substituted for the %N
conver- sion specification (see the Base Definitions volume
of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Chapter 8, Environment Variables).
If NLSPATH exists in the environment when the process
starts, then if the process has appropriate privileges, the
behavior of catopen() is undefined. If NLSPATH does not
exist in the environment, or if a message catalog can- not
be found in any of the components specified by NLSPATH, then
an implementation-defined default path shall be used. This
default may be affected by the setting of LC_MESSAGES if the
value of oflag is NL_CAT_LOCALE, or the LANG environment
variable if oflag is 0.</p>

<p>A message catalog descriptor shall remain valid in a
process until that process closes it, or a successful call
to one of the exec functions. A change in the setting of the
LC_MESSAGES category may invalidate exist- ing open
catalogs.</p>

<p>If a file descriptor is used to implement message
catalog descriptors, the FD_CLOEXEC flag shall be set; see
&lt;fcntl.h&gt;.</p>

<p>If the value of the oflag argument is 0, the LANG
environment variable is used to locate the catalog without
regard to the LC_MESSAGES cate- gory. If the oflag argument
is NL_CAT_LOCALE, the LC_MESSAGES category is used to locate
the message catalog (see the Base Definitions volume of IEEE
Std 1003.1-2001, Section 8.2, Internationalization
Variables).</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, catopen() shall
return a message catalog descriptor for use on subsequent
calls to catgets() and catclose(). Otherwise, catopen()
shall return ( nl_catd) -1 and set errno to indi- cate the
error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The catopen() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EACCES Search permission is denied for the component of
the path prefix of the message catalog or read permission is
denied for the mes- sage catalog.</p>

<p>EMFILE {OPEN_MAX} file descriptors are currently open in
the calling process.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG The length of a pathname of the message
catalog exceeds {PATH_MAX} or a pathname component is longer
than {NAME_MAX}.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG Pathname resolution of a symbolic link
produced an intermediate result whose length exceeds
{PATH_MAX}.</p>

<p>ENFILE Too many files are currently open in the
system.</p>

<p>ENOENT The message catalog does not exist or the name
argument points to an empty string.</p>

<p>ENOMEM Insufficient storage space is available.</p>

<p>ENOTDIR A component of the path prefix of the message
catalog is not a directory.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE Some implementations of catopen() use
malloc() to allocate space for internal buffer areas. The
catopen() function may fail if there is insufficient storage
space available to accommodate these buffers.</p>

<p>Conforming applications must assume that message catalog
descriptors are not valid after a call to one of the exec
functions.</p>

<p>Application writers should be aware that guidelines for
the location of message catalogs have not yet been
developed. Therefore they should take care to avoid
conflicting with catalogs used by other applications and the
standard utilities.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
