<p>NAME mtr - a network diagnostic tool</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS mtr [-hvrctglspniu46] [--help] [--version]
[--report] [--report-wide] [--report-cycles COUNT]
[--curses] [--split] [--raw] [--no-dns] [--gtk] [--address
IP.ADD.RE.SS] [--interval SECONDS] [--psize BYTES | -s
BYTES] HOSTNAME [PACKETSIZE]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION mtr combines the functionality of the
traceroute and ping programs in a single network diagnostic
tool.</p>

<p>As mtr starts, it investigates the network connection
between the host mtr runs on and HOSTNAME. by sending
packets with purposly low TTLs. It continues to send packets
with low TTL, noting the response time of the intervening
routers. This allows mtr to print the response per- centage
and response times of the internet route to HOSTNAME. A
sudden increase in packetloss or response time is often an
indication of a bad (or simply overloaded) link.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -h</p>

<p>--help Print the summary of command line argument
options.</p>

<p>-v</p>

<p>--version Print the installed version of mtr.</p>

<p>-r</p>

<p>--report This option puts mtr into report mode. When in
this mode, mtr will run for the number of cycles specified
by the -c option, and then print statistics and exit.</p>

<p>This mode is useful for generating statistics about
network quality. Note that each running instance of mtr
generates a significant amount of network traffic. Using mtr
to measure the quality of your network may result in
decreased network perfor- mance.</p>

<p>-w</p>

<p>--report-wide This option puts mtr into wide report
mode. When in this mode, mtr will not cut hostnames in the
report.</p>

<p>-c COUNT</p>

<p>--report-cycles COUNT Use this option to set the number
of pings sent to determine both the machines on the network
and the reliability of those machines. Each cycle lasts one
second.</p>

<p>-s BYTES</p>

<p>--psize BYTES</p>

<p>PACKETSIZE These options or a trailing PACKETSIZE on the
commandline sets the packet size used for probing. It is in
bytes inclusive IP and ICMP headers</p>

<p>If set to a negative number, every iteration will use a
differ- ent, random packetsize upto that number.</p>

<p>-t</p>

<p>--curses Use this option to force mtr to use the curses
based terminal interface (if available).</p>

<p>-n</p>

<p>--no-dns Use this option to force mtr to display numeric
IP numbers and not try to resolve the host names.</p>

<p>-o fields order</p>

<p>--order fields order Use this option to specify the
fields and their order when load- ing mtr. Example: -o
&quot;LSD NBAW&quot;</p>

<p>-g</p>

<p>--gtk Use this option to force mtr to use the GTK+ based
X11 window interface (if available). GTK+ must have been
available on the system when mtr was built for this to work.
See the GTK+ web page at http://www.gimp.org/gtk/ for more
information about GTK+.</p>

<p>-p</p>

<p>--split Use this option to set mtr to spit out a format
that is suitable for a split-user interface.</p>

<p>-l</p>

<p>--raw Use this option to tell mtr to use the raw output
format. This format is better suited for archival of the
measurement results. It could be parsed to be presented into
any of the other display methods.</p>

<p>-a IP.ADD.RE.SS</p>

<p>--address IP.ADD.RE.SS Use this option to bind outgoing
packets socket to specific interface, so that any packet
will be sent through this inter- face. NOTE that this option
doesn t apply to DNS requests (which could be and could not
be what you want).</p>

<p>-i SECONDS</p>

<p>--interval SECONDS Use this option to specify the
positive number of seconds between ICMP ECHO requests. The
default value for this parame- ter is one second.</p>

<p>-u Use UDP datagrams instead of ICMP ECHO.</p>

<p>-4 Use IPv4 only.</p>

<p>-6 Use IPv6 only.</p>

<p>BUGS Some modern routers give a lower priority to ICMP
ECHO packets than to other network traffic. Consequently,
the reliability of these routers reported by mtr will be
significantly lower than the actual reliability of these
routers.</p>
