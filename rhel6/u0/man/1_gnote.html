<p>NAME gnote - A simple note-taking application for
Gnome</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS gnote [OPTION] ...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page documents briefly the gnote
command.</p>

<p>Gnote is a desktop note-taking application for Linux and
Unix. Simple and easy to use, but with potential to help you
organize the ideas and information you deal with every
day.</p>

<p>Gnotes usefulness lies in the ability to relate notes
and ideas together, using a WikiWiki-like linking
system.</p>

<p>When run without any options, the Gnote note menu
appears in the Gnome Panels notification tray area.
Selecting a note from the menu dis- plays the notes spatial
window.</p>

<p>Changes to notes are saved automatically. Links to URLs,
files, and other notes are detected as you type. Rich
editing such as highlight- ing, bold, italics, undo/redo,
and variable font sizes are supported.</p>

<p>Global keybindings exist to allow fast access to Gnote
notes and dialogs. These keybindings are set in GConf (see
below) and may be activated from any application.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The program follows the usual GNU command line
syntax, with options starting with two dashes (--). A
summary of options are included below.</p>

<p>--new-note Create and display a new note.</p>

<p>--new-note TITLE Create and display a new note with the
title given.</p>

<p>--open-note TITLE/URL Display the existing note matching
TITLE or URL.</p>

<p>--start-here Display the &quot;Start Here&quot;
note.</p>

<p>--highlight-search TEXT Search and highlight TEXT in the
opened note.</p>

<p>--help Show summary of options.</p>

<p>--version Show version of program.</p>

stored in GConf. Changes to Set- tings are applied instantly
to any running Gnote instance. A summary of the GConf
settings and their purpose are described below.</p>
