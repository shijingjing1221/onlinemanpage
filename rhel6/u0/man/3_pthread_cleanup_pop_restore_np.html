<p>PTHREAD_CLEANUP_PUSH_DEFER_Linux Programmer s
PTHREAD_CLEANUP_PUSH_DEFER_NP(3)</p>

<p>NAME pthread_cleanup_push_defer_np,
pthread_cleanup_pop_restore_np - push and pop thread
cancellation clean-up handlers while saving cancelabil- ity
type</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;</p>

<p>void pthread_cleanup_push_defer_np(void (*routine)(void
*), void *arg); void pthread_cleanup_pop_restore_np(int
execute);</p>

<p>Compile and link with -pthread.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION These functions are the same as
pthread_cleanup_push(3) and pthread_cleanup_pop(3), except
for the differences noted on this page.</p>

<p>Like pthread_cleanup_push(3),
pthread_cleanup_push_defer_np() pushes routine onto the
threads stack of cancellation clean-up handlers. In
addition, it also saves the thread s current cancelability
type, and sets the cancelability type to
&quot;deferred&quot; (see pthread_setcancel- type(3)); this
ensures that cancellation clean-up will occur even if the
threads cancelability type was &quot;asynchronous&quot;
before the the call.</p>

<p>Like pthread_cleanup_pop(3),
pthread_cleanup_pop_restore_np() pops the top-most clean-up
handler from the threads stack of cancellation clean-up
handlers. In addition, it restores the threads cancelability
type to its value at the time of the matching
pthread_cleanup_push_defer_np().</p>

<p>The caller must ensure that calls to these functions are
paired within the same function, and at the same lexical
nesting level. Other restrictions apply, as described in
pthread_cleanup_push(3).</p>

<p>This sequence of calls:</p>

<p>pthread_cleanup_push_defer_np(routine, arg);
pthread_cleanup_pop_restore_np(execute);</p>

<p>is equivalent to (but shorter and more efficient
than):</p>

<p>int oldtype;</p>

<p>pthread_cleanup_push(routine, arg);
pthread_setcanceltype(PTHREAD_CANCEL_DEFERRED,
&amp;oldtype); ... pthread_setcanceltype(oldtype, NULL);
pthread_cleanup_pop(execute);</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO These functions are non-standard GNU
extensions; hence the suffix &quot;_np&quot; (non-portable)
in the names.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO pthread_cancel(3), pthread_cleanup_push(3),
pthread_setcancelstate(3), pthread_testcancel(3),
