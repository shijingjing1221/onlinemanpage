<p>SCALB(3) Linux Programmer s Manual SCALB(3)</p>

<p>NAME scalb, scalbf, scalbl - multiply floating-point
number by integral power of radix (OBSOLETE)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;math.h&gt;</p>

<p>double scalb(double x, double exp); float scalbf(float
x, double exp); long double scalbl(long double x, double
exp);</p>

<p>Link with -lm.</p>

<p>Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
feature_test_macros(7)):</p>

<p>scalb(): _BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE
&gt;= 500 scalbf(), scalbl(): _BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE ||
_XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;= 600</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION These functions multiply their first
argument x by FLT_RADIX (probably 2) to the power of exp,
that is:</p>

<p>x * FLT_RADIX ** exp</p>

<p>The definition of FLT_RADIX can be obtained by including
&lt;float.h&gt;.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, these functions return x *
FLT_RADIX ** exp.</p>

<p>If x or exp is a NaN, a NaN is returned.</p>

<p>If x is positive infinity (negative infinity), and exp
is not negative infinity, positive infinity (negative
infinity) is returned.</p>

<p>If x is +0 (-0), and exp is not positive infinity, +0
(-0) is returned.</p>

<p>If x is zero, and exp is positive infinity, a domain
error occurs, and a NaN is returned.</p>

<p>If x is an infinity, and exp is negative infinity, a
domain error occurs, and a NaN is returned.</p>

<p>If the result overflows, a range error occurs, and the
functions return HUGE_VAL, HUGE_VALF, or HUGE_VALL,
respectively, with a sign the same as x.</p>

<p>If the result underflows, a range error occurs, and the
functions return zero, with a sign the same as x.</p>

<p>ERRORS See math_error(7) for information on how to
determine whether an error has occurred when calling these
functions.</p>

<p>The following errors can occur:</p>

<p>Domain error: x is 0, and exp is positive infinity, or x
is positive infinity and exp is negative infinity and the
other argument is not a NaN An invalid floating-point
exception (FE_INVALID) is raised.</p>

<p>Range error, overflow An overflow floating-point
exception (FE_OVERFLOW) is raised.</p>

<p>Range error, underflow An underflow floating-point
exception (FE_UNDERFLOW) is raised.</p>

<p>These functions do not set errno.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO scalb() is specified in POSIX.1-2001, but
marked obsolescent. POSIX.1-2008 removes the specification
of scalb(), recommending the use of scalbln(3), scalblnf(3),
or scalblnl(3) instead. The scalb() func- tion is from
4.3BSD.</p>

<p>scalbf() and scalbl() are unstandardized; scalbf() is
nevertheless present on several other systems</p>

<p>SEE ALSO ldexp(3), scalbln(3)</p>

man-pages project. A description of the project, and
