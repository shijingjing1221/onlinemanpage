<p>FDATASYNC(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
FDATASYNC(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME fdatasync - synchronize the data of a file
(REALTIME)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>int fdatasync(int fildes);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The fdatasync() function shall force all
currently queued I/O opera- tions associated with the file
indicated by file descriptor fildes to the synchronized I/O
completion state.</p>

<p>The functionality shall be equivalent to fsync() with
the symbol _POSIX_SYNCHRONIZED_IO defined, with the
exception that all I/O opera- tions shall be completed as
defined for synchronized I/O data integrity completion.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE If successful, the fdatasync() function
shall return the value 0; oth- erwise, the function shall
return the value -1 and set errno to indi- cate the error.
If the fdatasync() function fails, outstanding I/O
operations are not guaranteed to have been completed.</p>

<p>ERRORS The fdatasync() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EBADF The fildes argument is not a valid file descriptor
open for writing.</p>

<p>EINVAL This implementation does not support synchronized
I/O for this file.</p>

<p>In the event that any of the queued I/O operations fail,
fdatasync() shall return the error conditions defined for
read() and write().</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
