<p>NAME XmStringUnparse A compound string function that
unparses text</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;Xm/Xm.h&gt; XtPointer
XmStringUnparse( XmString string, XmStringTag tag,
XmTextType tag_type, XmTextType output_type, XmParseTable
parse_table, Cardinal parse_count, XmParseModel
parse_model);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION XmStringUnparse looks in the input string
for text segments that are tagged with locale or charset
tags that match tag. The tag_type parame- ter specifies
whether the tag is a locale or charset type. If tag has a
value of NULL, all the segments are matched. When a text
segment is found with a matching tag, it is added to the end
of a resulting string. The characters in the resulting
string are of type output_type.</p>

<p>XmStringUnparse also checks string for components that
match components in parse_table, and also to see if the
component matches the condition specified by parse_model. If
the string component matches in both checks, then the
associated character is added to the end of the resulting
string.</p>

<p>string Specifies the XmString to be converted.</p>

<p>tag Specifies the tag to be used in matching with text
segments. Only text segments that match tag will be included
in the resulting string. If tag has a value of NULL, all
segments are considered as matches, and tag_type is
ignored.</p>

<p>tag_type Specifies the type of tag to be searched for,
including XmMULTIBYTE_TEXT, XmWIDECHAR_TEXT, and
XmCHARSET_TEXT.</p>

<p>output_type Specifies the type of text to be returned in
the string, including XmMULTIBYTE_TEXT, XmWIDECHAR_TEXT, and
XmCHARSET_TEXT.</p>

<p>parse_table Specifies the parse table to be used in
scanning for compound string components to be converted to
other characters.</p>

<p>parse_count Specifies how many entries are in
parse_table.</p>

<p>parse_model Specifies which non-text components to be
considered in matching in parse_table. These include:</p>

<p>XmOUTPUT_ALL Puts out all matching components.</p>

<p>XmOUTPUT_BETWEEN Puts out only those matching components
that are between two matching text components.</p>

<p>XmOUTPUT_BEGINNING Puts out only those matching
components that are at the beginning of a matching text
component.</p>

<p>XmOUTPUT_END Puts out only those matching components
that are at the end of a matching text component.</p>

<p>XmOUTPUT_BOTH Puts out only those matching components
that are at the beginning or end of a matching text
component.</p>

<p>RETURN Returns a newly allocated string containing
characters of a type deter- mined by output_type. The
application is responsible for managing this allocated
space. The application can recover this allocated space by
calling XtFree.</p>
